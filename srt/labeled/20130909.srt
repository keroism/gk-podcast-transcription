Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight's Motherboards, I can't believe we haven't talked about motherboards or have we?

4
00:00:24,183 --> 00:00:25,217
Rym: Let's do this.

5
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:28,647
Rym: Well, we're back legit from packs.

6
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,880
Rym: Yep, and now we got pretty much nothing until magfest.

7
00:00:33,821 --> 00:00:36,349
Rym: Oh Not yet, I'm not.

8
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,948
Rym: I'm not gonna do the Second half of that until it's within a month.

9
00:00:39,988 --> 00:00:41,312
Rym: It's mag fest.

10
00:00:41,352 --> 00:00:43,740
Rym: season is kind of like the lead-up to Christmas.

11
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,992
Rym: You can't bring out that Christmas tree at least until after Meg.

12
00:00:47,053 --> 00:00:54,048
Scott: This is effectively replaced Christmas Hanukkah, whatever You know, you don't celebrate that shit.

13
00:00:54,128 --> 00:00:55,572
Scott: It's just fucking new year's.

14
00:00:55,612 --> 00:00:57,496
Scott: miss New Year's mag fest.

15
00:00:57,537 --> 00:00:58,800
Scott: That is what is coming.

16
00:00:59,901 --> 00:01:00,926
Scott: Fuck everything else.

17
00:01:01,006 --> 00:01:07,112
Rym: I almost regret not going to one of those New Year's mag fest But at the same time I kind of like my own New Year's.

18
00:01:07,272 --> 00:01:15,475
Rym: so I like the fact that now we're gonna go to mag fest After having New Year's in the same town as mag fest, but not at mag fest.

19
00:01:15,495 --> 00:01:16,979
Scott: Well, there are a few things people should know.

20
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,495
Scott: Next weekend the 21st and 22nd is the Maker Faire, New York City.

21
00:01:23,856 --> 00:01:25,120
Rym: That's the following weekend.

22
00:01:25,281 --> 00:01:25,764
Rym: Oh, no.

23
00:01:25,784 --> 00:01:26,005
Rym: Yes.

24
00:01:26,065 --> 00:01:26,870
Scott: I said the 21st in the 22nd.

25
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,784
Rym: Yeah Not this weekend next.

26
00:01:29,804 --> 00:01:30,868
Rym: you did it right for once.

27
00:01:30,948 --> 00:01:32,856
Rym: Usually I jump all on you for doing that wrong.

28
00:01:32,876 --> 00:01:34,193
Rym: I apologize.

29
00:01:35,282 --> 00:01:36,593
Rym: Anyway, I was incorrect.

30
00:01:36,654 --> 00:01:41,439
Scott: October 18 1920 Burning con.

31
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,409
Scott: 2013 the pentec logon.

32
00:01:44,449 --> 00:01:45,351
Rym: you still buy tickets.

33
00:01:45,953 --> 00:01:46,354
Scott: I don't know.

34
00:01:46,374 --> 00:01:48,180
Rym: I still got to submit my game.

35
00:01:48,884 --> 00:01:51,420
Scott: Yep, I might miss Saturday.

36
00:01:52,042 --> 00:01:52,384
Rym: What?

37
00:01:52,845 --> 00:01:54,492
Scott: there is a netrunner tournament?

38
00:01:54,512 --> 00:01:55,094
Scott: Really?

39
00:01:55,234 --> 00:02:00,000
Scott: No, okay, so Normally I would be like netrunner tournament.

40
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,993
Scott: There's like two netrunner tournaments and one and there's one burning con a year.

41
00:02:04,214 --> 00:02:05,920
Rym: So Saturday is the heavy-hitting day.

42
00:02:06,342 --> 00:02:09,759
Scott: Why why would I skip the heavy-hitting day of burning con?

43
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,880
Scott: For a netrunner tournament of which there are two a month when there is only one burning con a year?

44
00:02:14,961 --> 00:02:16,091
Scott: that is just fucking stupid.

45
00:02:16,131 --> 00:02:22,117
Scott: right and Normally, I would but this isn't just any netrunner tournament.

46
00:02:22,418 --> 00:02:22,720
Rym: Okay?

47
00:02:23,563 --> 00:02:27,160
Scott: This is the netrunner plugged in tour.

48
00:02:27,902 --> 00:02:29,626
Scott: They're basically the fantasy flight.

49
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:44,079
Scott: peoples are traveling around the country to only a handful of places to run basically super netrunner tournaments between October 4th, so November 3rd netrunner tournament from a regular one.

50
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:49,834
Scott: Basically, the official dudes are gonna be there and it's all super serious business and they're giving away.

51
00:02:50,255 --> 00:02:51,980
Scott: I don't care about the sweat rare cards.

52
00:02:53,021 --> 00:02:55,655
Scott: No, it's just swag like play mats and stuff.

53
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:56,520
Scott: I don't care about that shit.

54
00:02:56,861 --> 00:03:00,354
Scott: okay, but if you go to one of these you can vote.

55
00:03:00,374 --> 00:03:14,456
Scott: there's two runners and You vote on which one you want to be real and then whichever one wins all the voting and it's only voting by people at These tournaments will become an actual runner card and the other one will be forever.

56
00:03:14,517 --> 00:03:18,090
Rym: D rezzed great So rainbow - is gonna be the next row.

57
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:18,913
Scott: No, it's this.

58
00:03:19,174 --> 00:03:20,419
Scott: the two choices are right.

59
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:23,935
Scott: here There's the collective and there's Laramie Fisk.

60
00:03:23,955 --> 00:03:24,940
Rym: I vote for Laramie Fisk.

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,632
Scott: I also vote for Laramie Fisk simply because he's not only better in every way.

62
00:03:29,053 --> 00:03:30,778
Rym: He's better in one way his name.

63
00:03:30,939 --> 00:03:35,200
Scott: Yeah He's a criminal and we got the other ones a shaper and we have plenty of shapers.

64
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:48,575
Scott: So the collective what that one does is this the first time you perform the same action three times in a row each turn Gain a click which is pretty powerful because like if you're running a magnum opus with those guys You could just be like magnum

65
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:48,938
Rym: magnum

66
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:49,240
Scott: magnum

67
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,341
Rym: Magnum

68
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:51,185
Scott: exactly,

69
00:03:51,326 --> 00:03:51,908
Rym: but

70
00:03:52,451 --> 00:03:55,826
Scott: their minimum deck size is 55.

71
00:03:55,826 --> 00:03:57,915
Rym: well 50 I thought you were gonna say 50.

72
00:03:57,915 --> 00:03:59,080
Scott: No, it's big 50.

73
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,840
Scott: They have to have a big deck and their influence is 5.

74
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,458
Scott: So it's pretty much shape for cards and more shape for cards and not gonna play with ya Laramie Fisk.

75
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:24,165
Scott: He's normal He's a criminal 4515 normal numbers and it says the first time you make a successful run on a central server each turn You may force the corp to draw one card When their hand is full.

76
00:04:24,506 --> 00:04:26,411
Scott: with five cards you run HQ.

77
00:04:26,672 --> 00:04:27,253
Scott: you take a look.

78
00:04:27,294 --> 00:04:29,680
Scott: see maybe with a nerve agent or an HQ interface.

79
00:04:30,641 --> 00:04:37,400
Scott: Then if they still have five cards, you know now they've got six and then their turn starts and they draw another one.

80
00:04:37,461 --> 00:04:42,952
Scott: now they got seven and They're gonna have to throw something out or use it all or something.

81
00:04:42,992 --> 00:04:45,340
Scott: and so run HQ again with your HQ interface.

82
00:04:45,402 --> 00:04:47,264
Rym: Scott Point.

83
00:04:47,324 --> 00:04:50,159
Rym: the first it's not Tuesday It's Monday.

84
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:51,303
Scott: All right point.

85
00:04:51,344 --> 00:04:56,540
Rym: the second you always give me shit for talking about this shit in the non meta moment section of the show.

86
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,084
Rym: That's true.

87
00:04:57,144 --> 00:04:57,829
Rym: So what gives?

88
00:04:58,252 --> 00:05:01,085
Scott: it's an intentional Back attack up.

89
00:05:01,306 --> 00:05:03,776
Rym: So you realize all you have done is given me carte blanche.

90
00:05:03,977 --> 00:05:07,286
Rym: No You legitimize me Scott.

91
00:05:07,326 --> 00:05:07,828
Rym: Not at all.

92
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:12,595
Rym: And if you and Emily have learned anything about me, it's that legitimizing Me is the last thing you want to do.

93
00:05:13,803 --> 00:05:14,466
Scott: Did you right?

94
00:05:14,486 --> 00:05:17,540
Scott: did not try to shut me down.

95
00:05:18,282 --> 00:05:22,536
Rym: I let you talk for almost five minutes about netrunner.

96
00:05:22,596 --> 00:05:24,723
Rym: Yeah Monday show But you're.

97
00:05:24,763 --> 00:05:27,070
Rym: you have noted that it was not good.

98
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:30,700
Rym: Have you not so are you so therefore or not?

99
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:35,246
Scott: If my netrunner talk was no good Then also all your talks are no good.

100
00:05:35,487 --> 00:05:36,710
Rym: only meta talks.

101
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:40,960
Scott: in the pre meta all your talks are belong to crap.

102
00:05:43,136 --> 00:05:44,285
Rym: So Up on new video card.

103
00:05:44,727 --> 00:05:45,350
Rym: about time.

104
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:48,225
Rym: I've been rocking a GTX 260.

105
00:05:48,225 --> 00:05:50,660
Scott: That's not a bad card that can play a lot of games.

106
00:05:50,901 --> 00:05:52,968
Scott: What game what game out today.

107
00:05:52,988 --> 00:05:56,160
Scott: counter-strike go needs a better card than counter-strike go.

108
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,392
Scott: How does counter-strike go not run at full frames of the 260 Scott?

109
00:05:59,433 --> 00:06:00,999
Rym: It doesn't really.

110
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:04,969
Rym: yeah No, so actually it will run at full frames.

111
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:05,932
Scott: It's not full quality.

112
00:06:06,373 --> 00:06:09,200
Rym: by cutting your draw distance big deal.

113
00:06:09,441 --> 00:06:18,677
Rym: I don't think you understand how narrow My draw distance is between my body and what I can hit in pretty much any map.

114
00:06:19,018 --> 00:06:21,830
Rym: if there's a window And I want to snipe in that window.

115
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:24,000
Rym: I cannot see beyond the window.

116
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,550
Rym: Sometimes I can't even see the window.

117
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:29,100
Scott: that sounds more like reflections than draw distance.

118
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,429
Scott: No window in behind the window either.

119
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:32,071
Scott: So just shoot.

120
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:32,673
Scott: It's a window.

121
00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:34,500
Rym: There might not be someone there.

122
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:35,600
Scott: So you wasted some bullets?

123
00:06:36,321 --> 00:06:39,252
Rym: Also the windows big and I can't see where to shoot it is.

124
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:44,088
Rym: having a 260 has Significantly impacted my ability to win.

125
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:46,034
Scott: you get a gun that fucking zooms.

126
00:06:46,335 --> 00:06:48,000
Rym: Oh, yeah, it zooms into nothing.

127
00:06:48,763 --> 00:06:51,634
Rym: You can't see player models that far away if there's no window.

128
00:06:51,654 --> 00:06:53,320
Rym: I can't see if there's a person.

129
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,054
Scott: So so if there is a person there he kills you and you can't even see him.

130
00:06:56,114 --> 00:06:57,200
Scott: Yes, that sucks.

131
00:06:57,441 --> 00:06:58,690
Rym: Yes, the GTX 260 is too old.

132
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,051
Scott: What do you just turn down like the texture qualities and increase the other?

133
00:07:03,252 --> 00:07:05,038
Rym: you can't control the draw distance.

134
00:07:05,098 --> 00:07:06,868
Rym: as far as I can Tell it's all dynamic.

135
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:13,280
Rym: Anyway, also details Disappear to a surprising degree and they do it so well that you don't notice it.

136
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:20,345
Rym: But if you're paying attention at all, like you're running and suddenly a tree like all these leaves appear on it Oh my my 680.

137
00:07:20,345 --> 00:07:21,289
Scott: don't know what that's like.

138
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:22,092
Rym: Yeah, you know what.

139
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,340
Rym: my 770 didn't cost that much.

140
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:29,696
Scott: No, it didn't fry for the my 680 by a lot, but Adobe will just recognize Adobe.

141
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:30,458
Rym: You'll have recognized 770 now.

142
00:07:31,721 --> 00:07:34,489
Scott: Good yeah, in fact, I got their fucking shit together asshole.

143
00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:37,337
Rym: I got Adobe to recognize my 260.

144
00:07:37,337 --> 00:07:38,260
Scott: nice doesn't work.

145
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,704
Rym: So well, no with some hacks.

146
00:07:39,925 --> 00:07:42,773
Rym: No, you can basically tell it in Creative Commons.

147
00:07:42,793 --> 00:07:44,478
Rym: You can be like yo dog Creative Commons.

148
00:07:44,578 --> 00:07:47,327

00:07:51,461 --> 00:07:52,746

00:07:52,766 --> 00:07:54,714
Rym: I won't guarantee.

00:07:54,754 --> 00:07:55,798
Rym: I'm not gonna crash.

Scott: but okay Speaking of creative cloud.

Scott: So if you want it get it right away.

162
00:08:17,761 --> 00:08:21,617
Rym: You said they have no plans to raise the price in the foreseeable future.

163
00:08:21,657 --> 00:08:22,018
Scott: That's good.

164
00:08:22,179 --> 00:08:26,540
Rym: granted We know that Adobe can finish saying what the hell this is about exactly one year.

165
00:08:27,404 --> 00:08:28,288
Scott: Ten bucks a month.

166
00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:35,533
Scott: you get the full Photoshop the real deal and The full Lightroom the real deal with perfect upgrades forever.

167
00:08:35,592 --> 00:08:45,053
Scott: Just like all the other creative cloud stuff Yep, and you get some other stuff like a Behance account and all that stuff You don't gonna use and it's only ten bucks a month now.

168
00:08:45,093 --> 00:08:46,860
Scott: That's a hundred and twenty dollars a year.

169
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,565
Scott: This is for the real Photoshop.

170
00:08:48,585 --> 00:08:52,940
Scott: This finally a reasonable price for a big expensive software.

171
00:08:53,121 --> 00:08:54,166
Scott: This has never happened before.

172
00:08:54,186 --> 00:09:01,540
Rym: it's huge for another reason to the biggest complaint That was semi legitimate against creative cloud because most people complaining are morons.

173
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:07,760
Rym: They don't realize that paying that monthly fee is actually way less than buying the full editions all the time.

174
00:09:08,042 --> 00:09:11,380
Scott: Well, it's only cheaper if you upgrade all the time.

175
00:09:11,561 --> 00:09:16,260
Scott: If you never if you buy the full creative suite and never up ever then you're better off doing that.

176
00:09:16,449 --> 00:09:17,704
Scott: No I'm the creator only.

177
00:09:17,744 --> 00:09:24,687
Rym: you were only better off if you bought one of those limited subsets because you didn't use the rest of it To buy everything everything the master suite.

178
00:09:24,828 --> 00:09:26,012
Rym: Yeah, it was expensive.

179
00:09:26,052 --> 00:09:29,985
Rym: Yep, but like a production premium Yeah, I could have gotten away.

180
00:09:30,005 --> 00:09:44,809
Rym: I was just keeping my cs4 anyway, but anyway, the biggest legitimate complaint was that Photoshop is special in that there's a huge huge number of people whose profession is photography or who are Serious photography hobbyist.

181
00:09:44,829 --> 00:09:47,060
Scott: There's a lot of people the only goddamn thing they need is photo.

182
00:09:47,786 --> 00:09:52,840
Scott: Need all that That Photoshop is used more than all those other things combined.

183
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,000
Rym: I'm gonna use more than one Adobe thing.

184
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:00,360
Rym: You probably use like five or ten Adobe things or you just use Photoshop and Lightroom.

185
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:03,721
Scott: Yeah, even most people use Photoshop not even Lightroom I know.

186
00:10:03,762 --> 00:10:12,439
Rym: but now just like how with creative cloud suddenly people started using Adobe They normally didn't use like I started using in design and illustrator because before I didn't have it.

187
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,738
Scott: But now what I learned, you know typekit where all the fonts come from.

188
00:10:15,818 --> 00:10:22,800
Scott: Yeah Creative cloud the one we pay for actually includes a very high class typekit account.

189
00:10:22,901 --> 00:10:25,380
Scott: I thought I had to pay for those fonts and it was just an integrated thing.

190
00:10:26,102 --> 00:10:33,722
Scott: I already paid for those fonts without even knowing Yeah I can just go get fonts and use them all I want and if I use them on a website I can do That too.

191
00:10:33,822 --> 00:10:36,353
Scott: as long as I don't the website doesn't get a fuck ton of traffic.

192
00:10:36,976 --> 00:10:38,260
Scott: and then I had to pay a little bit of money.

193
00:10:39,201 --> 00:10:44,748
Scott: But as long as the website just doesn't get crazy traffic I can use those fonts on a website Or anything I want.

194
00:10:44,808 --> 00:10:47,140
Rym: so you you implied that there was another piece to your news.

195
00:10:47,883 --> 00:10:50,513
Scott: Alright, so the second piece Photoshop added a feature today.

196
00:10:50,915 --> 00:10:52,260
Scott: That is incredibly interesting.

197
00:10:52,882 --> 00:10:55,330
Scott: There's a lot of people out there, you know Photoshop is.

198
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,814
Scott: it is a tool of many uses.

199
00:10:57,055 --> 00:10:58,480
Scott: many uses not intended, right?

200
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,919
Scott: It was originally intended for photo editing Yep.

201
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:07,077
Scott: And now people use it for three like in every raster image any any imaging thing period.

202
00:11:07,117 --> 00:11:08,120
Scott: they use Photoshop, right?

203
00:11:08,982 --> 00:11:16,947
Scott: One thing people use Photoshop for is to draw websites and they basically draw a picture of a website and then cut it up into Pieces and make a website.

204
00:11:17,028 --> 00:11:19,910
Rym: I'm gonna flash back to the year 2000.

205
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,195
Rym: Yeah I was at RIT and we're going to.

206
00:11:22,235 --> 00:11:26,128
Rym: I'm taking my Intro to new media class and they're like make a website.

207
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:31,684
Rym: and they told us and they gave us the software to draw it But not in Photoshop.

208
00:11:31,704 --> 00:11:43,020
Rym: They were like the noobs would use Photoshop for this but your pros we got to use fireworks Which is dead now fireworks 3.0 right alongside Macromedia director, right?

209
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:48,900
Scott: So anyway, the new feature they added to Photoshop was basically sort of what Microsoft is an Excel move, right?

210
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:52,494
Scott: Excel people like Microsoft is like you're gonna use Excel for that fine.

211
00:11:52,534 --> 00:11:53,819
Scott: We'll help you out and make that better.

212
00:11:54,303 --> 00:11:55,876
Scott: So Adobe is basically fine.

213
00:11:56,762 --> 00:12:01,037
Scott: You want to use Photoshop to draw websites and not use all this edge and stuff that we made for you.

214
00:12:01,057 --> 00:12:01,137
Scott: fine.

215
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:03,160
Scott: Here's this feature.

216
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:08,960
Scott: So what the feature is this you draw a website you keep all the pieces of the website in different layers, right?

217
00:12:09,981 --> 00:12:11,328
Scott: And you tell it hey Photoshop.

218
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,373
Scott: I'm drawing a website.

219
00:12:12,394 --> 00:12:14,333
Scott: Yo, it says alright, bro I got you.

220
00:12:15,222 --> 00:12:22,660
Scott: every layer is then turned into a JPEG GIF or ping and put into a folder and It's constantly updated.

221
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:29,740
Scott: So as you edit the layer It'll update the JPEG the GIF or the ping in that folder so that you can just go reload.

222
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:33,180
Scott: You can edit the Photoshop reload your website edit the Photoshop reload the website.

223
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,669
Scott: That's on your local machine until it looks right.

224
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:38,760
Rym: that is actually, you know, I'm not gonna make fun of it.

225
00:12:39,302 --> 00:12:42,340
Rym: It's an excellent example of use case driven design philosophy.

226
00:12:42,622 --> 00:12:44,272
Scott: That is a crazy good feature.

227
00:12:44,292 --> 00:12:48,569
Scott: if you're making websites and photo Yeah That efficiency gain you get from that feature.

228
00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:51,599
Rym: zoom out a little bit off the hook when people make software.

229
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:55,380
Rym: in general Way too many people for websites for software design for everything.

230
00:12:55,984 --> 00:13:00,166
Rym: They have a vision of what their things should be used Yeah, and they strive toward that.

231
00:13:00,226 --> 00:13:04,500
Rym: no look at what people actually try to do and make that easier.

232
00:13:04,781 --> 00:13:08,500
Scott: Yeah, it's like think about what the workflow was before it was going to Photoshop.

233
00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:16,221
Scott: Yeah Edit a bunch of stuff Cut a piece out save it in a separate folder and every time you wanted to cut a piece out save it in a separate Folder.

234
00:13:16,261 --> 00:13:17,425
Scott: now, it's just always.

235
00:13:17,486 --> 00:13:18,730
Scott: maybe you were checking.

236
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,413
Scott: There's no cutting.

237
00:13:19,694 --> 00:13:20,718
Scott: There's no cutting none.

238
00:13:22,242 --> 00:13:28,137
Scott: No cutting other than the layers which you should be just automatic is it's automatically a full a folder full of files.

239
00:13:28,257 --> 00:13:33,079
Scott: automatic not bad It's gonna save people like hours a day who do this stuff.

240
00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:43,360
Rym: if Except some of the people who should use that kind of feature the ones who won't or they don't know about it yet because it's Only in the newest newest Photoshop people have 3 and refused to upgrade.

241
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:48,686
Scott: Yeah, it's only in the creative cloud Photoshop if you pay for the you know $10 or the more dollars.

242
00:13:48,907 --> 00:13:52,719
Rym: so in all this talk about the NSA and encryption.

243
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,889
Scott: and Have we not talked about this enough?

244
00:13:54,909 --> 00:13:57,260
Scott: We've been talking about this since forever.

245
00:13:57,521 --> 00:13:59,332
Rym: Oh, well one we haven't talked about it that much.

246
00:13:59,392 --> 00:14:05,235
Scott: on GeekNights did a whole episode Multiple episodes on privacy and encryption and security.

247
00:14:05,255 --> 00:14:06,480
Rym: Yeah, we didn't talk about the NSA stuff.

248
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:16,993
Rym: but in all of that it seems like people talk about bitcoins a lot too and My news is to remind you that they're not that related.

249
00:14:17,193 --> 00:14:19,520
Rym: no bitcoins are not anonymous.

250
00:14:20,003 --> 00:14:22,299
Rym: No guys, they're not.

251
00:14:23,044 --> 00:14:24,793
Rym: They're pseudo anonymous.

252
00:14:25,296 --> 00:14:27,947
Rym: They're Intrinsic is the word you should use.

253
00:14:28,228 --> 00:14:33,652
Rym: but they are not anonymous because there's the thing called a blockchain Which is how the whole goddamn thing works.

254
00:14:34,255 --> 00:14:40,899
Rym: So this researcher took a Bitcoin Analyzed his blockchain and it was like right there.

255
00:14:41,361 --> 00:14:53,179
Rym: That's where the guy bought drugs on Silk Road and figured out how you can basically track what people have done with bitcoins And there's a good chance you could track the actual person that did the transaction if you really wanted to.

256
00:14:53,846 --> 00:15:00,416
Rym: Okay now People could take steps to a doubly triply anonymize and use services and everything.

257
00:15:00,437 --> 00:15:09,798
Rym: But the fact remains that Bitcoins primary use is not that it's anonymous It's that it's intrinsic and you can use it without trusting the other person you're doing business with.

258
00:15:09,818 --> 00:15:13,560
Rym: Mmm It's almost like a cash escrow except the cash is all virtual.

259
00:15:14,182 --> 00:15:19,560
Rym: So if you think you can use bitcoins to do anonymous shady stuff, I recommend you read this article.

260
00:15:20,525 --> 00:15:21,409
Rym: I got one more little news.

261
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,112
Rym: That one was little.

262
00:15:22,675 --> 00:15:27,680
Rym: so, uh There I heard there's a lot of sexism in the universe.

263
00:15:28,662 --> 00:15:30,289
Rym: In the tech industry in particular.

264
00:15:30,309 --> 00:15:32,660
Scott: there's a high concentration of it in that particular place.

265
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,847
Scott: That's sort of where it comes from these days.

266
00:15:35,047 --> 00:15:41,917
Rym: Yeah, it pretty much comes from the MRA subreddit and from the tech industry, but So those aren't the same thing.

267
00:15:43,682 --> 00:15:47,260
Rym: And I don't think a lot of people who post to MRA actually made it to the tech industry.

268
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:51,753
Rym: I think they're wishing they could be in the tech industry, but haven't actually quite gotten there.

269
00:15:51,773 --> 00:15:57,549
Scott: They get closer to their to their Mecca but Some people, two dudes.

270
00:15:57,851 --> 00:15:59,699
Rym: Oh, I think I have their names here from Sydney.

271
00:16:01,462 --> 00:16:03,564
Scott: Uh, JethroBots Great name.

272
00:16:03,885 --> 00:16:04,768
Rym: David Bolton.

273
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:05,451
Scott: Okay.

274
00:16:05,972 --> 00:16:07,197
Rym: At a TechCrunch event.

275
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:08,742
Scott: Oh Great.

276
00:16:08,862 --> 00:16:09,344
Scott: Yeah.

277
00:16:09,465 --> 00:16:11,712
Scott: Already this is looking worse and worse every second.

278
00:16:11,733 --> 00:16:11,973
Scott: Yup.

279
00:16:12,034 --> 00:16:15,420
Scott: Disrupt, which is a hackathon It's it's pretty much the worst thing ever.

280
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:20,980
Rym: They presented their joke app and it was supposed to be a joke and their joke app was TitStare.

281
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,860
Scott: Wow great job guys, that's gonna win them over.

282
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:31,741
Rym: Yeah It was pretty bad and I see a lot of the internet starting to try to defend them like look guys What?

283
00:16:32,263 --> 00:16:32,565
Rym: No.

284
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:32,946
Rym: What?

285
00:16:33,127 --> 00:16:34,392
Rym: Just stop it.

286
00:16:34,874 --> 00:16:35,616
Scott: WAT what?

287
00:16:36,138 --> 00:16:40,549
Rym: Yes Anytime you forget how egregious this shit is.

288
00:16:40,569 --> 00:16:45,899
Rym: This is just to remind you that shit like this happens at these conferences Pretty much all the time.

289
00:16:46,582 --> 00:16:47,627
Scott: Do you even internet?

290
00:16:47,888 --> 00:16:57,060
Rym: For every one scandal that happens that a PAX are related to a PAX There's like a hundred related to tech conferences and they're way worse and it's like how clueless are these people?

291
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,080
Rym: They did apologize, but it looks like it's because they were forced to by TechCrunch.

292
00:17:01,961 --> 00:17:04,489
Scott: Yeah, TechCrunch is also not the greatest.

293
00:17:04,628 --> 00:17:07,598
Rym: Yeah, but at least they put the token effort forth.

294
00:17:07,739 --> 00:17:17,631
Rym: Sure The thing is the app itself what it does were it not a Joke and were it not presented in this way could actually be cool.

295
00:17:17,651 --> 00:17:20,340
Rym: because the idea is let's say I buy a new video card Right.

296
00:17:20,361 --> 00:17:20,943
Rym: Mm-hmm.

297
00:17:21,042 --> 00:17:23,230
Rym: So here's what I was the app I would make.

298
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:27,960
Rym: I'd call it unboxing and use some clever web 3.0 spelling of boxing.

299
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,532
Rym: Yeah So I take my video card and I hold my phone up.

300
00:17:32,034 --> 00:17:34,792
Rym: one camera is pointed at the package The other one's pointed at my face.

301
00:17:34,812 --> 00:17:41,760
Rym: I Unbox it live and it videos the unboxing and my reaction to the unboxing at the same time.

302
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:47,460
Scott: Why don't we just make a app called double cam that videos both cameras at the same time?

303
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,951
Rym: But I would call it unboxing and really sell it as and in.

304
00:17:50,991 --> 00:17:52,216
Rym: have the site be all about.

305
00:17:52,497 --> 00:18:05,519
Rym: you set you tag What you unboxed so you can go to the site and be like video cards GTX 770 and you'll get all the unboxing videos of people who just got that or their own people would like Photoshop.

306
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:09,395
Scott: people would end Up using it just for the double cam part and oh, you know what?

307
00:18:09,697 --> 00:18:10,400
Rym: That's great.

308
00:18:10,661 --> 00:18:16,739
Rym: But having that conceit like vine or like Instagram gets it that initial cachet among morons.

309
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:20,331
Rym: Yeah So yeah guys make this app.

310
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:22,220
Rym: just don't make it hit stare.

311
00:18:27,703 --> 00:18:33,639
Rym: but anyway things of the day Ever wonder why we can't use our phones on planes.

312
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:37,955
Rym: Bullshit, this video is not what you expect and it is.

313
00:18:38,477 --> 00:18:39,422
Rym: it is great Cuz.

314
00:18:39,462 --> 00:18:41,433
Scott: it would annoy the fuck out of everyone else on the play.

315
00:18:41,714 --> 00:18:42,740
Rym: the conceit of this videos.

316
00:18:42,881 --> 00:18:45,880
Rym: The stewardess is like make sure you turn off your cell phones and this guy's like why?

317
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,363
Rym: Like really why?

318
00:18:47,383 --> 00:18:48,508
Rym: I just want to know I'll turn it off.

319
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:49,573
Rym: just explain to me why.

320
00:18:49,593 --> 00:18:53,585
Rym: and she explained so like, okay But okay, how come?

321
00:18:53,626 --> 00:18:55,394
Rym: I've turned off my Kindle and it just escalates.

322
00:18:55,414 --> 00:18:59,517
Rym: this one woman's like wait a minute So can I hold the plane hostage with my 3ds?

323
00:19:01,624 --> 00:19:02,700
Rym: And it just goes off from there.

324
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,777
Rym: This is an excellent video and I just want to point out that part of this video is kind of true.

325
00:19:06,857 --> 00:19:13,080
Rym: I have flown Around the world With work blackberries that I always forget to turn off.

326
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,580
Rym: They're just on in my carry-on the whole time when I was on the flight to Australia.

327
00:19:17,862 --> 00:19:25,755
Scott: There were some other packs people on that plane and and they played Wireless Mario Kart in flight and didn't give a fuck with each other.

328
00:19:25,775 --> 00:19:34,720
Rym: I on our flight home from fax as soon as the Stewardess walked past me after telling everyone to turn everything off.

329
00:19:34,801 --> 00:19:37,520
Rym: I just turned my Kindle back on and kept reading and the plane didn't crash.

330
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:38,783
Scott: Yeah, you know what?

331
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,250
Scott: Most people I see on planes.

332
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:42,600
Scott: It's like you're supposed to turn your shit off off.

333
00:19:42,821 --> 00:19:45,759
Rym: Oh, I've never ever turned my.

334
00:19:45,819 --> 00:19:50,560
Rym: no I've never seen anyone on the plane actually put the phone in autistic mode and that's it.

335
00:19:50,761 --> 00:19:53,660
Scott: Yeah, they just freaking you know, they don't even really do airplane.

336
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:57,660
Scott: But sometimes they do airplane mode most of the time, but most people just friggin just put the phone away.

337
00:19:57,741 --> 00:19:58,365
Scott: They like click it.

338
00:19:58,446 --> 00:19:59,594
Scott: It's the screen goes blank.

339
00:19:59,634 --> 00:20:06,076
Scott: They think that's off And sometimes just cuz they're dumb and not you know, so yeah, that's what I got.

340
00:20:06,096 --> 00:20:06,558
Rym: It's pretty funny.

341
00:20:06,859 --> 00:20:16,372
Scott: Okay I got so when I was a kid, I watched a lot of kids shows Eman and One of them is one that I did not watch but I know about that Rym watch.

342
00:20:16,613 --> 00:20:18,519
Rym: Oh m dot a dot s dot K.

343
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,992
Scott: No, Oh Thomas the te.

344
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:24,885
Scott: Oh You saw this video.

345
00:20:25,045 --> 00:20:25,827
Rym: Oh my god.

346
00:20:25,847 --> 00:20:30,440
Scott: This is a super cut doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo of Thomas the tank engine.

347
00:20:31,743 --> 00:20:35,974
Rym: Do train crashes and not some of that shining time station bullshit.

348
00:20:35,994 --> 00:20:38,400
Rym: We're talking about the actual Thomas the Tank Engine show.

349
00:20:38,641 --> 00:20:40,026
Rym: Yeah, you know who mr.

350
00:20:40,046 --> 00:20:41,391
Rym: Conductor was on shining time station.

351
00:20:41,411 --> 00:20:42,114
Scott: Well, there were two.

352
00:20:42,335 --> 00:20:43,760
Scott: Yeah, there's Ringo Starr.

353
00:20:43,881 --> 00:20:45,180
Scott: No and George Carlin.

354
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:49,331
Scott: Yeah I did not Appreciate who either of them was when I was very small.

355
00:20:49,431 --> 00:20:51,720
Rym: you want to know something that really says a lot about my childhood.

356
00:20:52,263 --> 00:20:53,692
Rym: I didn't know who Ringo Starr what like.

357
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:54,980
Rym: I didn't know that was Ringo Starr.

358
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:59,900
Rym: Not when I didn't understand that for a while, but I knew that was George Carlin from the beginning.

359
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:03,698
Rym: I think that says more about my parents than about me.

360
00:21:06,501 --> 00:21:07,524
Scott: Yeah, I didn't watch either one.

361
00:21:07,544 --> 00:21:10,874
Rym: this is actually a pretty good video in the meta moment.

362
00:21:10,915 --> 00:21:12,740
Rym: wait Scott already ruined the meta moment.

363
00:21:13,225 --> 00:21:13,608
Rym: It's over.

364
00:21:13,628 --> 00:21:15,984
Rym: Oh What do we do now?

365
00:21:16,366 --> 00:21:16,928
Scott: book club book.

366
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:18,675
Rym: the book club book is Stasi land.

367
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,120
Rym: I keep forgetting to update the website.

368
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,766
Rym: I'm gonna update the website ten nights.

369
00:21:22,108 --> 00:21:23,995
Scott: I keep forgetting to read it.

370
00:21:24,477 --> 00:21:25,340
Rym: It's pretty good.

371
00:21:25,461 --> 00:21:31,920
Rym: And again, I can't stress this enough The reason I want you to read this book is because you're not nearly mad enough about the NSA.

372
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:35,660
Scott: Why would I read a book when I could just watch salty bit?

373
00:21:37,144 --> 00:21:41,660
Scott: Okay, I guess other metas You might have discovered us because you saw us at PAX.

374
00:21:41,941 --> 00:21:50,493
Scott: Yeah, you can go and check us out everywhere on the internet that there are things You know how many of our videos of other packs panels are on YouTube?

375
00:21:50,533 --> 00:21:52,560
Scott: how many videos of things in general are on YouTube?

376
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:57,520
Scott: I just got I bought an elgato cap game capture HD, and I was just to test it it out.

377
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,811
Scott: I'm just streaming me playing games real soon.

378
00:21:59,831 --> 00:22:05,190
Rym: You're gonna seem to like it for some reason I think you're gonna get Scott and mines are regular outlaw matches.

379
00:22:05,511 --> 00:22:08,820
Scott: Maybe I don't know how we're gonna plug the Atari into the elgato.

380
00:22:09,081 --> 00:22:10,746
Rym: It's got our CA out.

381
00:22:11,468 --> 00:22:12,932
Scott: I don't know it needs component out.

382
00:22:13,313 --> 00:22:14,918
Scott: It's a game capture HD.

383
00:22:14,978 --> 00:22:15,660
Rym: God damn it.

384
00:22:16,145 --> 00:22:17,259
Rym: Is there an elgato SD?

385
00:22:20,565 --> 00:22:20,808
Scott: There is.

386
00:22:20,909 --> 00:22:21,678
Scott: I don't have it.

387
00:22:23,685 --> 00:22:27,364
Rym: Use the Atari emulator, maybe What other.

388
00:22:27,444 --> 00:22:36,652
Scott: yeah, but check us out on the Twitter's the Facebook's the Google pluses Google the forum on our own website our forums pretty awesome.

00:22:57,489 --> 00:22:58,353
Rym: You should go to SPX.

397
00:22:58,655 --> 00:22:59,560
Scott: I'm too busy for that shit.

398
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,202
Rym: Yeah, what are you gonna?

399
00:23:00,242 --> 00:23:02,672
Rym: Play netrunner salty bet salty bet and netrunner.

400
00:23:03,295 --> 00:23:06,444
Rym: someone's gonna make the salty bet app Just on your phone.

401
00:23:06,926 --> 00:23:12,690
Scott: I would just salty bet all day, but in your Google glass just oh my god It just anytime there's a new person to bet on.

402
00:23:12,731 --> 00:23:13,253
Scott: it's like all right.

403
00:23:13,273 --> 00:23:14,960
Scott: Who is it reverse you know?

404
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:16,402
Scott: Waifu.

405
00:23:16,523 --> 00:23:18,273
Scott: I always bet waifu ten bucks on waifu.

406
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:19,440
Scott: I just say ten bucks.

407
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:25,003
Scott: I got ten bucks on waifu and then he just takes the bet and then it shows me the result and then shows me the Next contenders.

408
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:25,565
Rym: Oh my god.

409
00:23:25,646 --> 00:23:28,940
Rym: I just watched this match where it said Goku Goku.

410
00:23:29,681 --> 00:23:31,208
Scott: I think our next Tuesday show was salty bets.

411
00:23:31,248 --> 00:23:33,859
Scott: I think it is so no show no talking.

412
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:37,673
Rym: right now I'm gonna spoil just so you guys know to listen to that show I watched a match.

413
00:23:37,975 --> 00:23:40,755
Rym: this character's name was Goku Goku And there was nothing there.

414
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,640
Scott: Nothing why I watched a fight yesterday.

415
00:23:45,561 --> 00:23:51,920
Scott: It was I forget who against Mike Tyson as in punch-out Mike Tyson all in on Tyson.

416
00:23:52,262 --> 00:23:54,418
Scott: I was all in on Tyson, and that was not a bad idea.

417
00:23:55,882 --> 00:23:57,008
Scott: No one fucks at the champ.

418
00:23:57,692 --> 00:23:59,220
Scott: Iron Mike was made of iron.

419
00:24:01,163 --> 00:24:03,200
Rym: So I can't believe we never did a show on motherboards.

420
00:24:03,925 --> 00:24:04,549
Scott: I hope we didn't.

421
00:24:04,649 --> 00:24:11,335
Rym: I searched our website and maybe Interesting to see if our opinions on motherboards have changed since the last time we did a show.

422
00:24:11,656 --> 00:24:13,825
Rym: if we have in fact talked about mother I hope we haven't.

423
00:24:13,926 --> 00:24:16,360
Scott: but yeah, I searched our archives didn't find an episode.

424
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:20,311
Scott: I think I searched on Newegg And I said what part of a computer haven't we done a show on?

425
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,239
Rym: and I know when we got to the point of like.

426
00:24:22,821 --> 00:24:27,140
Scott: See optical drives CD R double you dig in the bottom of the barrel.

427
00:24:27,542 --> 00:24:30,414
Scott: But again the motherboard is the most important part of the computer.

428
00:24:30,475 --> 00:24:32,041
Scott: Have we not done a show on it Now?

429
00:24:32,523 --> 00:24:37,159
Rym: I'm sure we've talked about them in a secondary sense in our like how to build a PC.

430
00:24:37,603 --> 00:24:43,369
Rym: I'm sure we have yeah, but Motherboard actually kind of matters less than it used to.

431
00:24:43,389 --> 00:24:47,040
Scott: in some ways it matters more and in some ways it matters less.

432
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:47,945
Scott: It matters more.

433
00:24:48,025 --> 00:24:50,216
Scott: and that it's called the motherboard for a reason right.

434
00:24:50,257 --> 00:24:53,027
Scott: like the mothership It is the core it is the computer.

435
00:24:53,087 --> 00:24:57,100
Scott: most of it right it is like the important part that connects everything together.

436
00:24:57,461 --> 00:25:01,172
Rym: But at the same time the processor does know what the processor does.

437
00:25:01,232 --> 00:25:03,920
Scott: the work, but all everything goes through the motherboard.

438
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:09,820
Rym: Right, but it's interesting if you grab made a graph of like how important the decision of your motherboard is.

439
00:25:10,482 --> 00:25:17,405
Rym: You basically didn't have a choice until I mean the era of people building their own computers who weren't Mid to late 90s.

440
00:25:17,586 --> 00:25:21,200
Rym: Yeah, like you people didn't build their own 46. is that commonly?

441
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,704
Scott: Yeah, it happened much more.

442
00:25:22,744 --> 00:25:31,349
Scott: when the Pentium lines came out is when computer building started to appear and not really until the Pentium Pro 2 did it really start to have.

443
00:25:31,389 --> 00:25:34,840
Rym: yeah that in the when the AMD k6 chips came.

444
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,740
Scott: That's when modern PC building really started to happen.

445
00:25:37,805 --> 00:25:45,087
Rym: Yeah That is when you'd go to egghead.com and you'd spend an entire week doing research on This motherboard computer.

446
00:25:45,108 --> 00:25:54,582
Rym: when you computer shopper magazine was around in the late 90s You know, but the modern sensibility of picking all your components and building a computer Widespread.

447
00:25:54,703 --> 00:26:00,804
Scott: no computer shopper magazine was the only way to do it before Internet's really took over before Egghead.com.

448
00:26:00,844 --> 00:26:01,990
Rym: that was not something I did.

449
00:26:02,071 --> 00:26:03,398
Rym: the first computer I built it was a k7.

450
00:26:04,621 --> 00:26:08,074
Scott: Yeah, the k7 was when first one I built was a Pentium 3.

451
00:26:08,074 --> 00:26:09,740
Rym: Yeah, I did not build a Pentium.

452
00:26:10,142 --> 00:26:11,651
Rym: I never built a Pentium back at first.

453
00:26:11,872 --> 00:26:13,159
Scott: so speaking of motherboards, right?

454
00:26:13,842 --> 00:26:21,268
Scott: So the most important part of the motherboard is basically the North Bridge South Bridge and that's basically been the way motherboards have been made For a long ass time.

455
00:26:21,328 --> 00:26:29,499
Scott: It used to matter a lot what you picked yeah, but basically there's these chips on the motherboard that are the North Bridge in the South Bridge and those do all the work of.

456
00:26:30,662 --> 00:26:44,933
Scott: You know getting the memory to talk to the you know processor to talk to the video ports right to do all this sort of other stuff to talk to the the IO ports with the SATAs and all that kind of stuff is all in the North Bridge in the South Bridge.

457
00:26:44,973 --> 00:26:46,317
Scott: It's split between these two chips.

458
00:26:46,618 --> 00:26:56,608
Scott: all right and When I first bought a computer it was a for Intel 440 BX The most reliable chip set on earth.

459
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:58,132
Rym: that PC ran forever.

460
00:26:58,232 --> 00:27:01,580
Scott: that Pentium 3450 never died when I thought it was dead.

461
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,813
Scott: It was actually the power supply, and I didn't realize it.

462
00:27:03,954 --> 00:27:05,946
Scott: when I got a new power supply It just worked again.

463
00:27:05,966 --> 00:27:14,066
Rym: It wasn't so much that it the hardware didn't die It was also that it was just really stable, but I think that was partly due to the fact that Younger kids might not remember.

464
00:27:14,608 --> 00:27:17,660
Rym: home-built computers used to be mad unstable.

465
00:27:17,821 --> 00:27:26,160
Rym: If you didn't know what you were doing you had to actually do a lot of research like all right setting up all these timings And the bio and voltages this via chipset.

466
00:27:26,702 --> 00:27:32,238
Rym: But if I buy this video card it might not work unless I change the clock on this.

467
00:27:32,478 --> 00:27:34,406
Rym: or well I bought this one kind of RAM.

468
00:27:34,667 --> 00:27:37,340
Rym: I gotta up the voltage a tiny bit to make it work.

469
00:27:37,661 --> 00:27:41,293
Rym: But if I up it too much, it'll burn out modern BIOS's.

470
00:27:41,353 --> 00:27:46,690
Scott: and now EFI which is in most motherboards Just automatically does all that shit correctly almost all the time.

471
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:55,712
Rym: I remember the first time I overclocked with my a bit motherboard So excited no one in there And I up the multiplier and it wouldn't fucking post because that was a mistake.

472
00:27:55,933 --> 00:28:03,476
Rym: and then instead I increase the FSB Yeah from a hundred megahertz to a hundred and thirty three megahertz.

473
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:12,475
Rym: oh That was a huge Huge performance gain and It also crashed about once a week.

474
00:28:12,515 --> 00:28:15,690
Rym: playing Counter-Strike More frames right.

475
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:40,188
Scott: so when you're shopping for motherboards You're gonna see they're gonna tell you sort of like what the what kind of chipset is on there right in terms of North and South Bridge and in turn I don't know all of them these days But I know the Intel ones is sort of split between the ones that have the letter Z and the ones that don't and the ones Z. those tend to have like these integrated video cards and stuff like that going on and the ones without the Z. Those don't have that.

476
00:28:40,329 --> 00:28:42,059
Scott: those are more like just motherboards.

477
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:50,722
Rym: Yep You know now if we're talking about advice on buying motherboards what it really comes down to nowadays is the more expensive ones usually aren't Better.

478
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:54,476
Rym: they just have more features that you probably don't need.

479
00:28:54,616 --> 00:28:55,098
Scott: right and time.

480
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,251
Scott: I'm practically speaking right.

481
00:28:57,291 --> 00:29:02,431
Scott: when you buy a motherboard today It's all about how many connectors does it have of which kinds?

482
00:29:02,712 --> 00:29:02,933
Scott: right?

483
00:29:02,973 --> 00:29:06,486
Scott: so you know it's like how many USB ports Can I get on this thing?

484
00:29:06,747 --> 00:29:07,611
Scott: how many do you need?

485
00:29:07,952 --> 00:29:09,600
Rym: I need a lot of fucking USB ports?

486
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:13,635
Rym: I don't want to buy USB hub Scott said connectors for the longest time.

487
00:29:13,735 --> 00:29:15,040
Rym: I would look at a spec on a motherboard.

488
00:29:15,122 --> 00:29:15,700
Rym: I'd be like all right.

489
00:29:15,961 --> 00:29:28,816
Rym: I need at least two ISAs and I need like six PC eyes because what I'd have sound card MIDI card Separate game controller card video card they used to not be like AGP or all these.

490
00:29:28,856 --> 00:29:34,270
Rym: we have like those things in My SCSI card another hard drive control.

491
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:36,656
Scott: Mike and my old my Pentium 3 had so many cards.

492
00:29:36,736 --> 00:29:38,140
Scott: my computer now has a video card.

493
00:29:38,441 --> 00:29:38,662
Rym: I know.

494
00:29:38,802 --> 00:29:39,184
Rym: I don't.

495
00:29:39,305 --> 00:29:40,730
Rym: I don't think I've put our card.

496
00:29:40,771 --> 00:29:42,518
Rym: that wasn't a video card in any computer.

497
00:29:42,578 --> 00:30:02,519
Rym: I've built since 2000 and 2000. yeah, nope I put the sound card the the PCI sound card Into the computer I built around 2004. okay, it had one PCI legacy slot for that sound card.

498
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:10,837
Scott: cool But yeah, it's all about how many connectors slots are still sort of important if you're gonna put stuff in them But there's just less stuff to put in them these days.

499
00:30:11,723 --> 00:30:13,370
Scott: How many RAM slots are there?

500
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,154
Scott: right?

501
00:30:14,897 --> 00:30:16,627
Scott: how many Really important?

502
00:30:16,728 --> 00:30:18,600
Scott: how many s ATA connectors are there?

503
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,687
Scott: So how many drives can you connect?

504
00:30:20,728 --> 00:30:22,153
Scott: does it even have a floppy connector?

505
00:30:22,173 --> 00:30:23,839
Scott: if you have an old floppy drive does it even have?

506
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,289
Scott: Old IDE connectors?

507
00:30:25,329 --> 00:30:30,434
Scott: if you have really old hard drives You know or maybe your CD ROM isn't s ATA and it needs an old.

508
00:30:30,775 --> 00:30:32,502
Scott: You know ID ribbon table You know what.

509
00:30:32,643 --> 00:30:34,510
Rym: seriously don't bother with ID.

510
00:30:34,591 --> 00:30:38,511
Rym: if you if you have any device that needs ID Get an external thing.

511
00:30:38,531 --> 00:30:39,760
Scott: we get all the data at it.

512
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,289
Rym: No, just buy a new one of that device.

513
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:44,878
Rym: a CD RW is like 12 bucks.

514
00:30:44,958 --> 00:30:46,923
Scott: That's true You know.

515
00:30:46,943 --> 00:30:50,015
Scott: does the motherboard have connectors for like you know all the audio inputs.

516
00:30:50,055 --> 00:30:51,119
Scott: on the front of your case I?

517
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,511
Rym: Would argue you don't want to use the onboard sound anyway.

518
00:30:55,672 --> 00:30:56,615
Scott: Yeah, well does it have?

519
00:30:56,635 --> 00:30:58,000
Scott: well most people?

520
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,345
Rym: Motherboard supports that.

521
00:31:00,606 --> 00:31:02,633
Scott: sure you know they have every month.

522
00:31:02,693 --> 00:31:02,874
Rym: No.

523
00:31:02,914 --> 00:31:04,620
Rym: There's two standards would be deprecating.

524
00:31:04,741 --> 00:31:06,520
Scott: It could be in a different spot on the motherboard.

525
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,584
Scott: It's annoying to connect to.

526
00:31:08,146 --> 00:31:08,386
Scott: you know.

527
00:31:08,507 --> 00:31:14,428
Scott: the arrangement of the things on the motherboard also matters a lot because if you pair up a Motherboard with a case it's like it's ATX ATX.

528
00:31:14,448 --> 00:31:17,300
Scott: Yeah, it'll fit, but will the wiring be nice?

529
00:31:17,424 --> 00:31:17,696
Scott: I know.

530
00:31:18,222 --> 00:31:24,320
Rym: I would argue that the case matters way more than the motherboard in the modern era because there's very little variation in motherboards.

531
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,584
Scott: There's still some variation.

532
00:31:25,624 --> 00:31:38,060
Scott: like if you use this motherboard with a case that has a bottom power supply instead of a top power supply Suddenly the wirings janky because the power connector on the motherboards in a weird spot Except the power connectors are almost always in the same spot almost always.

533
00:31:38,401 --> 00:31:46,254
Scott: But there's other connectors on the back of the computer that are important like if you've got the onboard video card Is there an HDMI or just a VGA or a DVI?

534
00:31:46,274 --> 00:31:47,480
Rym: I have not yet looked.

535
00:31:47,561 --> 00:31:49,200
Rym: I've been clicking on like 10 motherboards here.

536
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:51,027
Rym: I've not yet found one that didn't have HDMI.

537
00:31:51,107 --> 00:31:54,340
Scott: if it had integrated video does it still have ps2 mouse and keyboard if you need?

538
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:56,466
Rym: I know I have not seen one yet.

539
00:31:56,486 --> 00:31:58,432
Rym: That does not have that does the?

540
00:31:58,533 --> 00:32:00,980
Scott: how many USB threes are there versus USB twos?

541
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,912
Scott: How many fire wires are that doesn't even have fire wires?

542
00:32:04,615 --> 00:32:05,880
Scott: is the onboard sound card?

543
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,829
Scott: It just stereo sound or is it surround sound?

544
00:32:08,869 --> 00:32:12,120
Scott: does it have optical out or just the analog audio out?

545
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,699
Rym: But I guess the point we're getting at and then Scott's really getting at here.

546
00:32:15,504 --> 00:32:22,480
Rym: The feature set is what matters now not the back end Performancy stuff that used to matter or the compatibility stuff that used to matter.

547
00:32:22,711 --> 00:32:30,399
Rym: Yeah You can just pick a motherboard that has the features you want and if there's two that are pretty much equal and one cost more Money look at them side by side.

548
00:32:30,741 --> 00:32:39,047
Rym: most likely the more expensive one just has extra stuff more USB more SATA a Dedicated say to controller with rage.

549
00:32:39,087 --> 00:32:41,354
Scott: Well more expensive one could also be smaller.

550
00:32:41,675 --> 00:32:45,958
Scott: smaller is usually more money Except for when it's just not as good, right?

551
00:32:47,422 --> 00:32:52,680
Rym: You know like thing is again that's more limited by case and whether or not you want a game or video card.

552
00:32:52,901 --> 00:32:55,838
Rym: Yep, there's also a factor ATX AT micro.

553
00:32:55,898 --> 00:33:03,660
Scott: of course There's also some other boards that is made with better components like more better capacitors that are all solid-state might raise the price.

554
00:33:04,423 --> 00:33:06,111
Scott: Name brand raises the price.

555
00:33:06,393 --> 00:33:07,920
Rym: Yep, but what is the name brand?

556
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,353
Rym: Cuz when I the last time I was buying motherboards It was pretty much you bought a bit if you overclocked and wanted features.

557
00:33:13,373 --> 00:33:15,260
Rym: you bought aces if you never wanted it to crash.

558
00:33:15,441 --> 00:33:15,843
Rym: Pretty much.

559
00:33:15,883 --> 00:33:16,606
Scott: It doesn't matter what.

560
00:33:16,988 --> 00:33:19,480
Scott: as far as I can tell, you know, there's no name brand.

561
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,967
Scott: That is just better than the others.

562
00:33:21,047 --> 00:33:21,590
Scott: It's pretty much.

563
00:33:21,911 --> 00:33:23,920
Scott: is it name brand or not name brand?

564
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,920
Rym: Is it anything other than aces a bit gigabyte MSI?

565
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,021
Scott: Right.

566
00:33:28,121 --> 00:33:28,744
Scott: Is it not?

567
00:33:28,824 --> 00:33:32,920
Scott: is it one of the known motherboard brands or is it not one of those brands?

568
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,328
Scott: Is it like some ghetto brand right?

569
00:33:35,369 --> 00:33:36,473
Scott: Like I have an ASRock.

570
00:33:36,513 --> 00:33:37,095
Scott: That's a pretty much.

571
00:33:37,176 --> 00:33:37,396
Scott: Okay.

572
00:33:37,416 --> 00:33:38,320
Scott: That's a pretty well-known brand.

573
00:33:38,501 --> 00:33:40,368
Rym: It's actually really popular for HTTPS.

574
00:33:40,468 --> 00:33:43,520
Scott: Yeah, there's a lot of ones out there that are the big brands.

575
00:33:44,243 --> 00:33:50,509
Scott: But there are other brands out there like I'm pretty you know, I know star Biostar, but then you get into the second tier.

576
00:33:50,589 --> 00:33:59,254
Rym: I think all right new egg only lists six Alrighty, then aces ASRock gigabyte MSI ECS biostar.

577
00:33:59,334 --> 00:34:01,240
Scott: ECS is the only one that I've never heard of.

578
00:34:01,863 --> 00:34:03,411
Rym: Let me look at these ECS motherboards.

579
00:34:03,431 --> 00:34:06,865
Rym: Let's see there They look like motherboards.

580
00:34:07,326 --> 00:34:10,275
Rym: They're as expensive as the other brands.

581
00:34:10,435 --> 00:34:10,735
Rym: Okay.

582
00:34:10,795 --> 00:34:11,137
Rym: Wait a minute.

583
00:34:11,157 --> 00:34:11,839
Rym: This was only 50 bucks.

584
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,079
Rym: Let's see what's going on here.

585
00:34:13,434 --> 00:34:23,739
Scott: Yeah every motherboard manufacturer seems to have a full lineup from the cheapest to the most expensive with lots of Variations and it's like I really wonder like how many people are buying each of these slight variations.

586
00:34:24,041 --> 00:34:25,606
Scott: I know that it matters shouldn't?

587
00:34:25,626 --> 00:34:27,813
Scott: they have like fewer motherboards of like just like.

588
00:34:28,094 --> 00:34:30,139
Scott: here's the crazy gamer one with a million slots.

589
00:34:30,621 --> 00:34:33,049
Scott: Here's the sort of normal one with a regular number of slots.

590
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:36,480
Scott: Here's an 8 micro ATX that has like one video card hole.

591
00:34:36,922 --> 00:34:37,463
Scott: That's it.

592
00:34:37,864 --> 00:34:38,246
Scott: What else?

593
00:34:38,306 --> 00:34:39,389
Scott: what else do you need guys?

594
00:34:39,451 --> 00:34:39,752
Scott: Really?

595
00:34:39,772 --> 00:34:43,170
Rym: Yeah, and the differences are always really Subtle crap.

596
00:34:43,232 --> 00:34:43,879
Rym: It's never like.

597
00:34:43,899 --> 00:34:56,344
Scott: well This one only has one SATA controller with six connectors and this one has a second SAT controller with ten SAT connectors, but those four extra ones are on a separate, you know Controller.

598
00:34:56,364 --> 00:34:58,812
Rym: Yep, that has its own separate like raid thing.

599
00:34:58,852 --> 00:35:02,391
Scott: Yeah that launches after the first one launches Post.

600
00:35:02,573 --> 00:35:03,179
Scott: it's like what?

601
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,388
Rym: But I really I just there's.

602
00:35:06,628 --> 00:35:13,320
Rym: I need so little from my motherboard that I pick a name brand and I just picked the cheapest One that has all the holes I want in my mother.

603
00:35:13,521 --> 00:35:17,073
Scott: Yeah, the other of course most important thing about the motherboard is the socket.

604
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,000
Scott: right the socket is the thing.

605
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:22,279
Scott: That's where the CPU goes and you need it to be the right shape.

606
00:35:22,882 --> 00:35:25,270
Scott: You need it to be the right shape to match the CPU.

607
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:26,093
Scott: You're gonna put in it.

608
00:35:26,495 --> 00:35:31,293
Scott: the motherboard determines which kind of CPU it can hold and which kind of RAM it can hold.

609
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:44,068
Scott: and if you want a CPU that is Newer than or too far older than that motherboard or not the right shape for its socket or RAM That's faster than or slower than and not the right kind for that motherboard Need a motherboard now.

610
00:35:44,088 --> 00:35:52,280
Rym: at the same time a lot of motherboards that list all the speeds of RAM They'll take but a lot of those speeds are non-standard and don't mean anything unless you're overclocking.

611
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:58,239
Rym: And in fact a lot of RAM will say it supports X speeds But yet you're never gonna actually put that in the stock of it.

612
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:04,760
Scott: It's so weird how the motherboard companies encourage overclocking and the CPU companies encourage overclocking in the video card companies.

613
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:07,540
Rym: In the old days they used to try to actively lock you out of overclock?

614
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:10,313
Scott: No, the CPUs would be the ones to over to lock you out.

615
00:36:10,353 --> 00:36:11,840
Scott: The motherboards didn't want to lock you.

616
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:21,557
Rym: Well, but I remember there was a time when a bit seemed to be the motherboard that didn't stop you But all their motherboards didn't really give you any way to overclock without really fucking around.

617
00:36:21,577 --> 00:36:24,824
Scott: Oh But yeah It's it's motherboards.

618
00:36:24,865 --> 00:36:28,439
Scott: don't even give a shit about overclocking the CPUs of the companies that don't want you to.

619
00:36:28,902 --> 00:36:31,413
Scott: But even they don't seem to be stopping anyone anymore.

620
00:36:31,574 --> 00:36:32,518
Scott: They're just like go for it.

621
00:36:32,558 --> 00:36:32,880
Scott: What else?

622
00:36:33,161 --> 00:36:44,483
Rym: Yeah, well partly because I think manufacturing technology is improved and Binning is probably more common because it they're not making as many bad chips It's a guess.

623
00:36:44,805 --> 00:36:48,497
Rym: so things are eminently overclockable and you're paying for the guarantee.

624
00:36:48,517 --> 00:36:48,978
Rym: Mm-hmm.

625
00:36:50,923 --> 00:36:56,343
Scott: so another thing to watch out for with motherboards is flash and Flare.

626
00:36:56,563 --> 00:37:03,807
Scott: right the motherboards that have like crazy colored metal coloring covering things Like you can't avoid it.

627
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:05,673
Rym: gamery shit, you can't avoid it.

628
00:37:05,773 --> 00:37:07,960
Scott: and look how look at all the orange garbage all over that one.

629
00:37:08,149 --> 00:37:08,823
Rym: Yeah you know what.

630
00:37:08,923 --> 00:37:17,360
Rym: you can't avoid it because that's the heat pipe and all the stuff and The pea kinds of people who drive the motherboard consumer market now are gamer guys.

631
00:37:17,581 --> 00:37:19,869
Scott: Anyway, it's like you buy some ram even ram chips.

632
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:22,580
Scott: you buy some ram chips and it's got like these blue spikes all over it.

633
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,278
Scott: It looks all crazy.

634
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,900
Rym: Well, because all ram chips now in the old days you'd buy ram.

635
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,785
Rym: They all look the same.

636
00:37:27,086 --> 00:37:29,640
Rym: and then you could buy ram coolers that you never needed.

637
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,065
Rym: You could stick onto your RAM.

638
00:37:31,526 --> 00:37:35,860
Rym: now pretty much all the RAM comes with these crazy heat sinks sticking off the top.

639
00:37:36,141 --> 00:37:37,650
Scott: Yeah, but it's like the this.

640
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,500
Scott: the design of them is so ridiculous.

641
00:37:40,261 --> 00:37:41,344
Rym: Yeah, but you can't avoid it.

642
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:46,399
Scott: So the more expensive motherboards always have more ridiculous stuff on them.

643
00:37:47,202 --> 00:37:49,111
Rym: Well, you can get the fatality editions of things.

644
00:37:49,151 --> 00:37:51,160
Scott: I guess still yeah, those are the more expensive ones.

645
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:58,805
Scott: Yeah And the more gamer you get the more ridiculous the motherboard looks to try to convince you to buy it When it's actually not any bet.

646
00:37:58,866 --> 00:38:11,276
Scott: it's like they'll have another motherboard that's exact just as good maybe has a few less connectors on it and It's like really really They just need to somehow psychologically convince you to buy that motherboard.

647
00:38:11,296 --> 00:38:11,537
Scott: That's $100 more.

648
00:38:13,443 --> 00:38:32,960
Rym: I just I really am fascinated that for the longest time for most of the pcs I'd built in the course of my life motherboard decision mattered so much for so many reasons and now it's Fairly a generic choice that comes down to a very limited set of features I require and most of the things I used to care about I don't care about anymore.

649
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:40,325
Scott: Yeah, my decision-making process for buying motherboard is pretty much this I have this many hard drives and other CD ROM drives and such.

650
00:38:40,365 --> 00:38:42,893
Scott: does it have enough s ATA connectors for all of those?

651
00:38:43,555 --> 00:38:50,657
Scott: if it doesn't it's ruled out - does it have a PCI Express slot that will handle the video card that I'm putting into it?

652
00:38:50,677 --> 00:38:51,620
Scott: the maximum speed?

653
00:38:52,244 --> 00:38:54,379
Scott: Okay, good it has that it's not ruled out.

654
00:38:55,002 --> 00:38:58,700
Scott: Does it have a CPU socket matching the CPU that I'm going to purchase?

655
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,880
Scott: Does it have enough RAM slots to hold the RAM that I'm going to put into it?

656
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:06,520
Rym: My trouble is the computer I built has six dim slots.

657
00:39:07,062 --> 00:39:20,013
Scott: Yeah, as long as it has that a lot as long as it has yes to all of those questions Then it's an okay motherboard and I'll get it and any you know Whichever one the cheapest that meets all of the requirements.

658
00:39:20,394 --> 00:39:28,900
Rym: that is from a name-brand Yep, like when I think about what I look at because I'm not gonna build a new computer yet I bought between buying the video card and buying some more hard drives.

659
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:44,156
Rym: I've staved off having to upgrade this computer that I built in 2009 mind you for at least another year Maybe longer, but if I were to buy a new computer now because I did the research, you know It's worth seeing should I just buy a new computer rather than upgrading the one I had

660
00:39:44,196 --> 00:39:44,377
Scott: on the?

661
00:39:44,397 --> 00:39:45,040
Scott: you need new computer.

662
00:39:45,361 --> 00:39:51,280
Rym: I thought the research concluded that I don't because buying a few hard drives cost almost nothing compared to buying a new computer.

663
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:59,539
Rym: but When I when I was doing my research the things that I was doing the most research on I found were the CPU.

664
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:05,040
Rym: again Like what is the exact price point to make a computer that I will not upgrade again anytime soon?

665
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:09,858
Rym: Like do I really need the i7 nowadays as opposed to in the old days?

666
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:16,367
Rym: well, the i5 be good enough like those kinds of questions and Beyond that it was just how much RAM do I really need?

667
00:40:16,367 --> 00:40:16,948
Rym: 12 or 24?

668
00:40:16,948 --> 00:40:17,289
Rym: I have 32.

669
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:17,630
Rym: It's crazy.

670
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:24,525
Rym: I don't even need that much yep, and That's it.

671
00:40:24,545 --> 00:40:27,640
Rym: Like I think the case is what I'm gonna agonize over the most.

672
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:32,204
Scott: Yeah, pretty much So motherboards.

673
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:33,589
Scott: do we have anything else to say about that?

674
00:40:33,669 --> 00:40:35,496
Rym: I know I mean unless we get into anecdotes.

675
00:40:35,556 --> 00:40:42,397
Rym: I mean remember When I had that motherboard at RIT and it started flipping out and eventually stopped working.

676
00:40:42,417 --> 00:40:43,420
Scott: the capacitors exploded.

677
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:50,889
Rym: We opened it up and all the capacitors that exploded all over it because it was that Janky stolen formula of the.

678
00:40:50,929 --> 00:40:53,437
Rym: it was the sabotage formula for capacitor fluid.

679
00:40:53,457 --> 00:40:55,638
Rym: Yep Those are good days.

680
00:40:56,742 --> 00:40:59,451
Rym: Now I just have all these extra motherboards laying around nothing to do with them.

681
00:40:59,531 --> 00:41:01,899
Scott: How many times people tried to push a CPU?

682
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:10,040
Scott: Heatsink onto a motherboard pushed too hard and broke the CPU and/or cracked the motherboard because they didn't have the motherboard seated properly.

683
00:41:10,506 --> 00:41:11,479
Rym: I have never done that.

684
00:41:11,701 --> 00:41:15,014
Rym: I've never done but I always think I did it every time I install the CPU.

685
00:41:15,034 --> 00:41:19,500
Scott: cuz when you put that heatsink down it Goes click click click and you can't tell between that noise and the motherboard breaking.

686
00:41:19,681 --> 00:41:24,800
Rym: I know because the motherboard breaking just makes a really loud single crack and so does the heatsink actually linking in.

687
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:27,328
Rym: Yeah, so does the CPU actually linking in.

688
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:28,412
Scott: not as much.

689
00:41:28,693 --> 00:41:30,860
Rym: it used to used to make a mush louder cracking noise.

690
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:34,660
Scott: Well, now they've moved the pins from the CPU onto the motherboards.

691
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,165
Scott: The sockets have changed.

692
00:41:36,246 --> 00:41:40,783
Scott: used to be the pins were on the bottom of the CPU and when the pin was bent the CPU was Ruined.

693
00:41:40,863 --> 00:41:43,540
Scott: now when the pin is bent the motherboard is ruined.

694
00:41:43,761 --> 00:41:52,932
Rym: One thing you can say is there was a time when they when they went to the socket from the socket to the slot The nice thing about the slot was that that was not a problem.

695
00:41:52,952 --> 00:41:55,580
Rym: You just slid your CPU in like you did a video card.

696
00:41:55,781 --> 00:41:58,360
Scott: Yeah, there are other problems with that like performance.

697
00:41:58,521 --> 00:42:00,129
Rym: Well, it's funny how cooling.

698
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:06,047
Rym: for actually for the short term cooling and Some kinds of performance were easier.

699
00:42:06,328 --> 00:42:09,217
Rym: They did that because they could fit a fuck ton more cash on the thing.

700
00:42:09,438 --> 00:42:12,205
Scott: That was Something for its time.

701
00:42:12,305 --> 00:42:19,910
Rym: Yes, and then we admit it me it's so quickly we got from Cooling and cash mattering more to.

702
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:23,020
Rym: oh the physical distance actually matters a lot.

703
00:42:23,341 --> 00:42:26,153
Rym: We got to actually physically get the CPU closer to the motherboard again.

704
00:42:26,354 --> 00:42:26,575
Scott: Yep.

705
00:42:27,318 --> 00:42:30,733
Rym: Oh, wow Yeah, motherboards are not as interesting as they used to be.

706
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:34,470
Scott: Oh your motherboard these days I guess we didn't mention also includes your network card.

707
00:42:34,691 --> 00:42:37,020
Scott: Yeah used to be a to buy Ethernet cards.

708
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:44,600
Rym: In fact at my first computer that had a network card at an ISA network card And I also had an ISA sound card.

709
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:55,435
Rym: I had a Sound Blaster all 32 plugged in to my one ISA slot and on the same ISA bus I had an ISA network card connected via 10 base Ethernet to my cable modem.

710
00:42:55,997 --> 00:42:59,271
Rym: up until like Anytime I started a big download.

711
00:42:59,351 --> 00:43:02,043
Rym: my audio would stutter I think.

712
00:43:02,143 --> 00:43:08,380
Scott: up until like when we lived in Beacon my computers had Ethernet cards that weren't the motherboard.

713
00:43:09,721 --> 00:43:14,034
Rym: Right my computer at RIT the one I built at RIT while we were living there.

714
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:16,080
Rym: I bought a dedicated network card.

715
00:43:16,381 --> 00:43:18,733
Scott: Yep, and it's interesting now how it's like.

716
00:43:19,235 --> 00:43:28,694
Scott: even when I went to college I had to buy a network card on the internet and bring it with me to college because I had just a modem a USB Modem attached to my computer not an Ethernet card USB modem.

717
00:43:28,754 --> 00:43:29,979
Scott: I had an ISA modem.

718
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,934
Scott: Yeah, home computers just had friggin modems.

719
00:43:32,974 --> 00:43:34,160
Scott: They didn't have network cards.

720
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,993
Scott: You didn't have a LAN in your house right.

721
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:37,000
Scott: hardly anyone had that.

722
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,326
Scott: Routers were not home equipment now.

723
00:43:39,346 --> 00:43:40,490
Scott: They're routers at home equipment.

724
00:43:41,072 --> 00:43:43,340
Scott: people have ethernet cards just built into the good.

725
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,990
Scott: But now people are using wireless cards.

726
00:43:46,351 --> 00:43:48,078
Scott: some motherboards even have wireless built-in.

727
00:43:48,118 --> 00:43:54,359
Rym: It's crazy But the fact that the moral of this whole show is that motherboards are a lot less interesting than they used to be.

728
00:43:56,042 --> 00:43:59,532
Scott: It's a weird, but becoming more interesting by include just having more.

729
00:43:59,813 --> 00:44:03,188
Scott: you know commodity stuff just built into the motherboard That doesn't matter.

730
00:44:03,228 --> 00:44:06,844
Scott: like sound cards network cards The they matter less.

731
00:44:07,566 --> 00:44:12,340
Scott: you know it used to matter more when the motherboard did less stuff because then you know those different.

732
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:14,753
Scott: You know, but now that motherboard does so many things.

733
00:44:14,814 --> 00:44:15,960
Scott: It's all commoditized.

734
00:44:16,341 --> 00:44:20,820
Scott: So your choice is kind of meaningless, and we're seeing this across all aspects of home computing.

735
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:29,700
Rym: I mean when I built computers back in the day to talk about RAM for a second I'd have to research the RAM timings and the RAM brands yup of my motherboard and figure out the compatibility.

736
00:44:30,123 --> 00:44:32,419
Rym: And then I actually would have to look at what?

737
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:35,107
Rym: Cast latency cycle do I want?

738
00:44:35,328 --> 00:44:36,893
Rym: am I willing to pay more for cast?

739
00:44:36,954 --> 00:44:37,616
Rym: who RAM?

740
00:44:37,656 --> 00:44:38,600
Rym: is that a cast three?

741
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:44,496
Rym: Nowadays if you look at RAM it gives you all these ridiculous statistics about cast.

742
00:44:44,777 --> 00:44:52,240
Rym: you know like twelve Six four four four two two two one and all these numbers that from a performance standpoint mean nothing.

743
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:58,448
Rym: Benchmarks, there's no way to tell it does not matter in 99.9 repeating percent of the.

744
00:44:58,568 --> 00:45:02,982
Scott: it only matters if over clocking is your hobby and over clocking is a Stupid hobby.

745
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:08,420
Rym: well even that if it is even if it is your hobby most of those numbers don't matter anymore.

746
00:45:08,661 --> 00:45:10,994
Scott: Yep, all the things what there aren't.

747
00:45:11,155 --> 00:45:12,060
Scott: at least in those days.

748
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:18,638
Scott: There were some games that no one could get full frames on with any equipment right like the software was outpacing the hardware you could Have at your house.

749
00:45:19,041 --> 00:45:20,969
Scott: You got like crisis the day it came out.

750
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:23,680
Scott: or I forget what the other game big deal game was before that.

751
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:28,856
Scott: It's like you couldn't full settings full frames it no matter what you bought, and you really needed that.

752
00:45:28,896 --> 00:45:29,839
Scott: a super expensive shit.

753
00:45:29,899 --> 00:45:35,219
Scott: now You can full frames full settings with like you know last generation.

754
00:45:35,259 --> 00:45:38,399
Rym: well I mean, I think part of that is the advance of video cards.

755
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,163
Scott: That's also.

756
00:45:39,244 --> 00:45:40,691
Scott: the video card does more than anything.

757
00:45:40,731 --> 00:45:42,440
Scott: my previous computer was a core to duo.

758
00:45:43,022 --> 00:45:48,225
Scott: I upgraded the video card in it from an 8800 GT to a 460 or a 470.

759
00:45:48,225 --> 00:45:51,321
Scott: I forget and Just.

760
00:45:51,522 --> 00:45:52,626
Scott: it just went crazy fast.

761
00:45:52,646 --> 00:45:57,180
Scott: all the all the games are suddenly crazy crazy performance huge boost even though nothing else change.

762
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:04,327
Rym: Yep, and that's the video card does all the work, and that's why when Scott said you know rib You don't need to build a new computer now I built my computer in 2009.

763
00:46:04,327 --> 00:46:11,047
Scott: the only thing that I think should be good for two more years at least things that are obsolete Are video cards and spinning discs.

764
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:15,840
Scott: that thing should be good for two if not three more years and by then who even knows?

765
00:46:17,263 --> 00:46:30,752
Rym: Because there is actually a problem it does not support PCI Express 3 fully the new the new high speed so I will actually not get full Theoretical performance out of my GTX.

766
00:46:30,772 --> 00:46:34,871
Scott: when you do upgrade in two years You'll probably be able to bring that video cart over with.

767
00:46:34,932 --> 00:46:49,763
Rym: yeah when I say upgrade my computer You know what that would entail in the modern era a new CPU a new motherboard RAM to put in it if it doesn't use the same RAM I already have and new hard drives maybe Maybe?

768
00:46:50,004 --> 00:46:53,140
Scott: hard drives tend to be the thing that lasts the longest like my drives.

769
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:57,694
Scott: I think I usually carry drives around for like 15 years before.

770
00:46:57,834 --> 00:47:01,299
Rym: the only reason I need to upgrade drives Is that this computer was built before?

771
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:03,526
Rym: SSDs were really available.

772
00:47:03,546 --> 00:47:11,286
Rym: I mean I bought a 32 gig SSD at considerable expense And I ran my games off of that 32 gigs.

773
00:47:12,801 --> 00:47:21,675
Rym: Now I can just buy a bunch of hybrid drives and whatever and actually I'm thinking about sticking these two new drives into doing A RAID 0 just for video editing performance.

774
00:47:21,775 --> 00:47:22,699
Scott: You do whatever you can do.

775
00:47:23,041 --> 00:47:32,329
Rym: yeah, but the point is the computer upgrade cycle is so drastically different from what it used to be that my CPU is a limit on rendering video.

776
00:47:33,072 --> 00:47:38,379
Rym: if I render a video and I had a faster processor It might take four less hours out of the 18 hours it takes.

777
00:47:46,263 --> 00:47:48,820
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

778
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:53,619
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

779
00:47:53,921 --> 00:47:55,888
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at front row.

Scott: crew calm for show notes discussion news and more.

784
00:48:16,296 --> 00:48:17,580
Scott: It's actually recorded at night.
