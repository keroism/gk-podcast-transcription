1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,729
Rym: It's Wednesday, January 8th, 2020!

2
00:00:12,729 --> 00:00:16,920
Rym: I'm Rym, I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights Tonight.

3
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,480
Rym: We're talking about some meta about GeekNights.

4
00:00:20,241 --> 00:00:21,437
Scott: It's Meta Moment, the whole show.

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:23,798
Scott: Let's do this!

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:39,699
Rym: So yeah, every year we have GeekNights hiatus around this time, usually because we have a bunch of conventions, we have to travel for the holidays, family stuff happens, it's a good time to reset, get some quiet work done, I fucks with the audio pipeline, all that kind of thing.

7
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:45,820
Rym: But this year, for a bunch of unrelated reasons, this was like the biggest hiatus we've ever had.

8
00:00:45,881 --> 00:00:47,800
Scott: We did some episodes in there, but not many.

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:55,880
Rym: Not many, because one, there were some personal dramas among us and our friends, like some medical issues and things, like not me or Scott directly, but like our friends.

10
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,120
Scott: It all started after PAX West when I moved.

11
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,538
Rym: Yep, Scott moved.

12
00:01:00,701 --> 00:01:01,440
Scott: A short distance.

13
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,080
Rym: I'm like tearing apart my bedroom.

14
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,307
Scott: It still took a lot of effort.

15
00:01:04,367 --> 00:01:06,260
Scott: That bedroom's not keeping you from doing a podcast.

16
00:01:06,561 --> 00:01:10,099
Rym: No, it kept me from doing a podcast like one day, because I had to do it some time.

17
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,820
Scott: Right, but then I was done moving, we did some shows a little bit, but then you went on a business travel.

18
00:01:15,421 --> 00:01:31,500
Rym: Yep, the problem was, I used to do this Asia trip, like two or three weeks in Asia every year for work, but my new job, I didn't have to do that trip, so I planned my life and expected to take all this time off at different times, and then I also had to do this trip again, so I had double the time off from what I expected.

19
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:40,351
Scott: Anyway, and then we had a PAX Unplugged, and then a Thanksgiving PAX Unplugged, and then...

20
00:01:41,163 --> 00:01:42,300
Rym: Like Christmasy time.

21
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,460
Scott: December, Christmasy time, and PAX South is next week.

22
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:51,520
Rym: Yeah, like this coming weekend is the only free weekend I'll have had in like more than a month.

23
00:01:52,522 --> 00:01:54,419
Rym: I do not have free time.

24
00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:01,200
Scott: No, but PAX South should only bump out maybe one more GeekNights episode.

25
00:02:02,881 --> 00:02:07,100
Rym: Next week on Tuesday we're going to review Nokosu Dice, that's like the hottest new hotness.

26
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,479
Rym: We've been wanting to talk about this since PAX Unplugged.

27
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,619
Scott: Yeah, there was a pre-order for it and it sold out, so deal with it.

28
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,280
Rym: I mean, I made my own copy, that's how obsessed I am with this game.

29
00:02:16,641 --> 00:02:18,500
Rym: It was sold out by the time I thought to go pre-order.

30
00:02:19,263 --> 00:02:20,720
Scott: Oops, everyone else has one.

31
00:02:20,921 --> 00:02:21,439
Rym: I got fucked.

32
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:28,780
Rym: But also, then we're going to have PAX East, actually not that long after PAX South.

33
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:34,580
Scott: PAX East is early this year, so we'll have somewhat consistent GeekNights in February.

34
00:02:35,262 --> 00:02:36,380
Rym: March is going to get a little fucked.

35
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,800
Scott: Right, a little early March, May, who knows.

36
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:45,040
Scott: But then April through PAX West we're going to have consistent GeekNights again.

37
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:45,819
Rym: Yep, so don't worry.

38
00:02:46,886 --> 00:02:48,300
Scott: As consistent as GeekNights is.

39
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:57,657
Rym: Because I know with webcomics in the early 2000s, whenever there was a news post that was like, "The state of the comic," that usually translated to, "We're

40
00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:58,059
Rym: ending.".

41
00:02:58,742 --> 00:03:03,768
Rym: And most podcasts, "The state of the podcast" literally is the show where people say, "Yeah, we can't do this

42
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:04,213
Rym: anymore.".

43
00:03:05,062 --> 00:03:05,920
Rym: We're doubling down.

44
00:03:06,941 --> 00:03:14,540
Scott: I always find it funniest in general when people feel the need to announce quitting, ending, leaving.

45
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,071
Scott: Just stop.

46
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,538
Scott: Yeah, just stop.

47
00:03:18,103 --> 00:03:22,688
Scott: Someone who announces, "I'm leaving," that tells me, "Yeah, you might be

48
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:22,929
Scott: leaving.".

49
00:03:26,382 --> 00:03:30,000
Scott: But you're looking for all kinds of attention and discussion.

50
00:03:30,584 --> 00:03:32,059
Scott: You really just want to make a huff.

51
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:32,780
Rym: Well, it depends.

52
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:37,740
Rym: Are you leaving in a huff or are you ending one project to do it?

53
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,159
Rym: What if we were like, "GeekNights is ending because we are now joining some company to make

54
00:03:43,179 --> 00:03:43,460
Rym: gaming.".

55
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,040
Rym: We both work for a game company.

56
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,520
Scott: Yeah, if you're making just an announcement.

57
00:03:46,621 --> 00:03:49,280
Scott: But I feel like most of the time when people announce--.

58
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,980
Rym: Here are my theses on why I'm leaving this community.

59
00:03:54,180 --> 00:04:03,160
Scott: Right, when someone does that-- Things that are going to everybody's and everybody's wife, fucking everybody in everybody's room, fucking back door, fucking fish tank.

60
00:04:04,484 --> 00:04:07,040
Rym: I'm just curious if anyone knows what I'm talking about.

61
00:04:07,522 --> 00:04:10,280
Rym: That's an in-joke from the earliest GeekNights.

62
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,900
Scott: If someone does that, what they're actually saying is, "I don't want to leave.

63
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:23,860
Scott: I want to have a big discussion and I want you to acquiesce to some of my demands to change things to make me less upset so that I won't leave.

64
00:04:25,084 --> 00:04:27,460
Scott: I want to see how upset people are that I'm leaving.

65
00:04:28,306 --> 00:04:29,396
Scott: Show me how much you miss

66
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:29,537
Scott: me.".

67
00:04:29,943 --> 00:04:30,480
Rym: Scott, here's the thing.

68
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,580
Rym: You're thinking about recent internet shouty men.

69
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:37,060
Rym: I know a lot of webcomics where that last thing was like, "Look, some shit went down in my life.

70
00:04:37,181 --> 00:04:38,140
Rym: I can't do this anymore.

71
00:04:38,662 --> 00:04:39,578
Rym: I hope you enjoyed it.

72
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,334
Rym: It's a real heartfelt

73
00:04:41,354 --> 00:04:41,738
Rym: goodbye.".

74
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:51,094
Rym: I've also seen a lot of people like, "Look, I'm stopping this webcomic because I have been working for Marvel for five years and I can't keep doing this comic that you're all obsessed

75
00:04:51,114 --> 00:04:51,296
Rym: with.".

76
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,400
Rym: It's not always your thing.

77
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,820
Rym: I think about most internet shouty men in the last decade.

78
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:03,992
Scott: The point is if you say it in more than a few words, you should be able to just be like, "Yo, I can't do this anymore.

79
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:04,476
Scott: Bye-bye.".

80
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,700
Rym: Yeah, but I would give a final farewell if GeekNights ever ended.

81
00:05:09,545 --> 00:05:12,140
Rym: I suspect GeekNights will end when one or both of us die.

82
00:05:13,221 --> 00:05:13,604
Scott: All right.

83
00:05:13,685 --> 00:05:14,998
Scott: Let me get this poison over here.

84
00:05:15,762 --> 00:05:17,459
Rym: Dude, I'm drinking some poison right now.

85
00:05:17,807 --> 00:05:17,940
Rym: Uh-oh.

86
00:05:19,101 --> 00:05:19,376
Scott: All right.

87
00:05:20,923 --> 00:05:22,080
Rym: Let's do some news thing of the day.

88
00:05:22,741 --> 00:05:23,668
Rym: First, the open event.

89
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,339
Rym: You know how we roll.

90
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:37,639
Rym: We've had a month of adventures, but we're going to talk about some things that happen in our lives that are probably pretty prosaic and literally all of those exciting things will be lost like tears in the rain.

91
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:45,936
Rym: For the last year, I've been getting bruises in the bottom third of my legs, above my knee, up there.

92
00:05:47,385 --> 00:05:48,060
Rym: I'd have these bruises.

93
00:05:48,321 --> 00:05:50,339
Rym: For a long time, they'd just appear every now and then.

94
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,775
Rym: I'd be like, "Oh, what did I

95
00:05:51,815 --> 00:05:51,937
Rym: do?".

96
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,815
Rym: I was getting vaguely thought, "Oh, I must have just banged at rock

97
00:05:54,835 --> 00:05:55,157
Rym: climbing.".

98
00:05:55,741 --> 00:05:58,020
Rym: But I haven't been rock climbing much in the last month and a half.

99
00:05:58,701 --> 00:05:59,719
Rym: I still got these bruises.

100
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,619
Rym: I was thinking, "Oh, no.

101
00:06:02,341 --> 00:06:03,610
Rym: Do I have a disease?

102
00:06:03,751 --> 00:06:04,798
Rym: Should I be a doctor about

103
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:04,919
Rym: this?".

104
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:05,540
Scott: Bruzitis.

105
00:06:06,202 --> 00:06:12,360
Rym: So then, today, at work, I had a meeting that was a good heated conversation with one of my best engineers.

106
00:06:12,963 --> 00:06:16,319
Rym: We're on a whiteboard, trying to figure out a big thing.

107
00:06:18,004 --> 00:06:24,479
Rym: The tables at my office are at this height, and they have super sharp corners that come to this weird point.

108
00:06:25,362 --> 00:06:30,439
Rym: I bumped into this table six times in the course of this discussion, getting up and down.

109
00:06:30,921 --> 00:06:33,858
Rym: I realized that is literally exactly where the bruise appears.

110
00:06:34,101 --> 00:06:36,420
Scott: You've been bumping into the table for a long time?

111
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:43,065
Rym: I've been bumping into these tables at work for the last two years, and I just assumed it was rock climbing injuries, and now I've realized the truth.

112
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:43,854
Rym: Fuck those tables.

113
00:06:43,955 --> 00:06:44,400
Rym: God damn it.

114
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,680
Scott: Why don't you complain about the tables?

115
00:06:45,801 --> 00:06:46,163
Scott: I will.

116
00:06:46,203 --> 00:06:48,115
Rym: I'm going to open a ticket tomorrow and be like,

117
00:06:48,155 --> 00:06:48,396
Rym: "Listen.".

118
00:06:49,545 --> 00:06:50,999
Scott: Is anyone else bruising the cells in the table?

119
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:51,504
Rym: I don't know.

120
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:52,820
Rym: Maybe I should ask the company.

121
00:06:53,627 --> 00:06:57,259
Rym: I'll put out a blast and be like, "Hey, so, you all know me.

122
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,079
Rym: I'm the product manager of all these things.

123
00:07:00,061 --> 00:07:03,486
Rym: The thing that's bothering me more about this community is these tables.

124
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,193
Scott: Get these tables out here.

125
00:07:06,214 --> 00:07:06,295
Scott: I

126
00:07:06,336 --> 00:07:06,498
Scott: quit.".

127
00:07:07,582 --> 00:07:09,279
Rym: So, what happened to you in the last month?

128
00:07:10,505 --> 00:07:10,939
Scott: Uh, whatever.

129
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,458
Scott: I went to some conventions.

130
00:07:14,722 --> 00:07:15,320
Rym: Here's a question.

131
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,840
Scott: I stayed inside a lot to avoid the cold.

132
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,700
Rym: What was the best thing you did at MAGFest?

133
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,526
Rym: We were just there.

134
00:07:19,728 --> 00:07:20,335
Rym: The most fun thing.

135
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:21,657
Scott: Top of your mind.

136
00:07:23,963 --> 00:07:24,879
Rym: Because I got one.

137
00:07:26,181 --> 00:07:27,159
Scott: I didn't tabletop a lot.

138
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,300
Scott: There was too much good shit.

139
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,571
Rym: Yeah, this was a good MAGFest.

140
00:07:29,591 --> 00:07:30,339
Rym: I went to a lot of panels.

141
00:07:30,925 --> 00:07:32,480
Scott: There was so much equally good shit.

142
00:07:33,221 --> 00:07:36,295
Scott: There wasn't one thing that was like, "Oh, that was the best

143
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:36,599
Scott: thing.".

144
00:07:37,261 --> 00:07:38,150
Rym: What's top of mind?

145
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,120
Rym: What's one of the great things?

146
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:39,928
Rym: Because mine is simple.

147
00:07:39,969 --> 00:07:41,657
Rym: I went to more concerts than I normally go to.

148
00:07:42,702 --> 00:07:45,598
Rym: But I caught the Anda Super Soul Brothers, who I love, but I've seen them a lot.

149
00:07:46,381 --> 00:07:48,500
Rym: But then I caught this ska band.

150
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:49,860
Rym: Ska System.

151
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,760
Rym: Never is a band been on the fucking wavelength of Rym before.

152
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:55,765
Rym: Like this band.

153
00:07:55,786 --> 00:07:57,767
Rym: They come out, they play some ska.

154
00:07:58,069 --> 00:08:02,240
Rym: The second song they play is a ska cover of the Zelda II Temple music.

155
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,760
Rym: Then they did a ska cover of Sans Undertale's song.

156
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,714
Rym: It was good.

157
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,780
Rym: Also late 90s, early 2000s infotainment positivity songs.

158
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,251
Rym: It was a good ska band.

159
00:08:13,272 --> 00:08:13,738
Rym: I'm feeling them.

160
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:14,845
Scott: I don't know.

161
00:08:14,865 --> 00:08:17,959
Scott: It wasn't the best thing at MAGFest, but there was that.

162
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:23,053
Scott: for some reason I went to several computer programming related things.

163
00:08:23,113 --> 00:08:25,820
Scott: I went to a panel of a guy talking about writing an emulator.

164
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,487
Rym: Oh, that was fun.

165
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:27,258
Rym: Because it wasn't like.

166
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,610
Rym: here's the science of it.

167
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,525
Rym: He was just like, I tried to write an emulator.

168
00:08:30,747 --> 00:08:32,179
Rym: Here's the shit I had to deal with.

169
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,258
Scott: We went to the Tazbot panel.

170
00:08:33,561 --> 00:08:34,489
Rym: That was actually pretty good.

171
00:08:34,509 --> 00:08:35,780
Scott: They also talked about programming.

172
00:08:36,763 --> 00:08:40,812
Scott: And then we went to the panel of a super late night panel, which shouldn't have been so late night.

173
00:08:40,871 --> 00:08:44,308
Rym: I only came to the last third of it, and that last third was fascinating.

174
00:08:44,328 --> 00:08:48,262
Rym: And apparently, according to Scott, the first two thirds were way more than that.

175
00:08:48,282 --> 00:08:50,759
Scott: There was a guy who was an expert on Japanese PCs.

176
00:08:52,181 --> 00:08:54,916
Scott: He was all into Japanese PCs and PC games.

177
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:01,800
Scott: Basically, Windows 95 is when Japan joined the Wintel, right?

178
00:09:02,283 --> 00:09:05,336
Scott: Before then, they had all these other PC systems.

179
00:09:05,377 --> 00:09:06,386
Scott: You may have heard of MSX, MSX2.

180
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,712
Scott: It was like FM Towns or something like that.

181
00:09:10,732 --> 00:09:18,339
Scott: They were like, all these other PC systems, architectures that they had before Windows 95 when they joined the rest of the world.

182
00:09:19,623 --> 00:09:21,820
Scott: And you don't have those computers in the West.

183
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,239
Rym: And people wrote games on them.

184
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,194
Scott: Japan didn't have Apple IIs and Commodores like we had, right?

185
00:09:27,823 --> 00:09:30,719
Scott: And we didn't have ZX Spectrums like the UK had.

186
00:09:32,143 --> 00:09:38,679
Scott: I watch a lot of games and other fascinating softwares for those systems and it was really cool to see.

187
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:46,519
Rym: Most of the people I watch on YouTube who talk about that kind of stuff are not in the US, so I literally think of it as the ZX Spectrum.

188
00:09:47,361 --> 00:09:48,289
Scott: 8BitGuy does it yet.

189
00:09:48,592 --> 00:09:50,092
Scott: 8BitGuy doesn't know nothing about MSX2, right?

190
00:09:50,762 --> 00:09:52,497
Rym: No, I don't know nothing about MSX2.

191
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,056
Scott: There was MSX and MSX2.

192
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,536
Rym: I didn't even know there was an MSX2.

193
00:09:56,342 --> 00:10:00,158
Rym: I knew about the MSX even when I was young because when I was a kid playing...

194
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,430
Scott: Well, it wasn't the MSX.

195
00:10:01,551 --> 00:10:02,480
Scott: MSX was like a standard.

196
00:10:03,305 --> 00:10:13,104
Rym: Yeah, but I knew it existed but didn't know anything about it because as a kid I knew Metal Gear and some nerd at my school was like, oh the real version is on the MSX but you can't play that.

197
00:10:13,185 --> 00:10:14,924
Rym: And he didn't know anything more than that sentence.

198
00:10:15,005 --> 00:10:16,220
Scott: That's also all I know.

199
00:10:17,766 --> 00:10:19,759
Scott: But yeah, that was very fascinating.

200
00:10:20,581 --> 00:10:24,680
Rym: So in some news, we're not going to talk about how the world's on fire and our president is literally.

201
00:10:25,388 --> 00:10:27,450
Rym: The world is literally on fire right now.

202
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:30,034
Scott: The world is on fire in many places in many ways.

203
00:10:30,094 --> 00:10:32,480
Rym: Both literally and metaphorically.

204
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,000
Scott: Yet somehow we can still sit here and make GeekNights and go to work and do everything normally.

205
00:10:38,925 --> 00:10:40,780
Rym: But we are shielded by privilege and money.

206
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,679
Scott: We are shielded by many things but those shields are on fire.

207
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:51,657
Rym: I played some Artemis space bridge on Sunday at Magfest and I did engineering which I've never done before.

208
00:10:53,240 --> 00:11:01,638
Rym: Repeatedly I had to remind the captain that we do not have any fucking forward shields because you will not go to a space station where shields are low but they're holding for now.

209
00:11:02,841 --> 00:11:12,120
Rym: So in some other news College Humor and I'm not going to go too deep into the details but I'm going to link to a source of many GeekNights things of the day.

210
00:11:12,222 --> 00:11:16,840
Scott: College Humor the first many years of GeekNights existence was a big deal.

211
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:31,747
Scott: I don't think you understand how important College Humor was to modern internet humor to internet video content creation around the time GeekNights was created up for several years thereafter College Humor was a big fucking deal.

212
00:11:32,111 --> 00:11:34,640
Rym: And Adam Conover who I haven't talked to, I knew him.

213
00:11:34,722 --> 00:11:35,357
Rym: I don't know him now.

214
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,010
Rym: he is more famous now.

215
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,900
Rym: he had a TV show but he was one of the people.

216
00:11:42,343 --> 00:11:46,820
Rym: College Humor was a lot of very talented people doing a lot of really cool stuff.

217
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,319
Scott: a lot of those people went on to become like SNL writers and shit.

218
00:11:50,488 --> 00:11:53,087
Scott: it was like an entry point into the world of big time comedy.

219
00:11:54,821 --> 00:12:05,199
Scott: as you would go to College Humor you would get it's like SNL but good as an entry level comedian and then you would flex and then you'd bust out.

220
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:14,380
Scott: there was like a who was on College Humor who was like a cousin of the Perry Bowell Fellowship.

221
00:12:15,552 --> 00:12:16,815
Scott: there was all kinds of people on there.

222
00:12:17,262 --> 00:12:18,771
Rym: I knew a lot of people.

223
00:12:20,484 --> 00:12:25,798
Scott: there was a guy named something Ruben who wasn't related to me but then my sister knew him.

224
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,283
Scott: but anyway

225
00:12:28,767 --> 00:12:46,459
Rym: I'll link to this thread because basically College Humor was one of those things that existed back when there were more websites and if you're not aware we've talked about this a little bit before but basically Facebook and Google sort of conspired to destroy all other content creation on earth.

226
00:12:47,187 --> 00:12:56,500
Rym: why have your own website say frontrowcrew.com with a bunch of videos on it or say ScrewAttack or College Humor or Dorkly or any of these sites that had independent content?

227
00:12:56,964 --> 00:13:00,860
Scott: why make a website where you post videos and people come to your site to watch your videos?

228
00:13:01,203 --> 00:13:04,420
Scott: when there's YouTube the place people go to watch videos you just have a YouTube channel.

229
00:13:04,602 --> 00:13:06,239
Scott: you'll get more views that way.

230
00:13:06,521 --> 00:13:11,720
Rym: but now YouTube owns you but also they made a lot of non-video content.

231
00:13:11,781 --> 00:13:12,918
Rym: that was really good.

232
00:13:14,007 --> 00:13:21,220
Rym: also cracked another one of these sites and basically Facebook lied so much about viewership numbers.

233
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:24,260
Scott: we've talked about this story before that it destroyed College Humor.

234
00:13:24,341 --> 00:13:29,440
Rym: but College Humor limped on and only now is being completely decimated.

235
00:13:29,704 --> 00:13:30,839
Rym: almost everyone was fired.

236
00:13:31,504 --> 00:13:34,257
Rym: a lot of really talented people are out of work.

237
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:38,179
Scott: well they'll all get real comedian jobs being writers in SNL or whatever.

238
00:13:38,931 --> 00:13:41,759
Scott: not that SNL is that great but it pays and it still exists.

239
00:13:42,063 --> 00:13:51,940
Rym: but if you need comedy people or you need content creation people production line people anyone at Light Up College Humor come work for GeekNights temporarily.

240
00:13:52,062 --> 00:13:53,500
Scott: we can't pay you enough to eat.

241
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,020
Rym: I can't pay you a salary but I can pay you contract gigs.

242
00:13:56,121 --> 00:14:01,219
Rym: yes we can pay you contracting hours to make something if any of you want to come on GeekNights.

243
00:14:02,345 --> 00:14:03,480
Rym: but anyway read this thread.

244
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:08,040
Rym: I tweeted about this but this is a real shame.

245
00:14:08,302 --> 00:14:17,617
Rym: this is a sad day for humor and content on the internet and it's worth reading this thread to really internalize how fucked up a situation the internet is in right now.

246
00:14:18,505 --> 00:14:20,740
Scott: it's similar to all the private equity destroying things.

247
00:14:20,821 --> 00:14:23,780
Scott: by the way Bed Bath and Beyond next thing to be destroyed by private equity.

248
00:14:23,861 --> 00:14:25,860
Scott: but I don't care because fuck Bed Bath and Beyond.

249
00:14:27,091 --> 00:14:27,598
Scott: I don't like them.

250
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:33,800
Rym: I don't really have an opinion on the existence of Bed Bath and Beyond.

251
00:14:33,901 --> 00:14:35,213
Scott: I just don't like that.

252
00:14:35,233 --> 00:14:41,480
Scott: when I bought something there with my credit card they hassled me for info by email address and I didn't give it to them.

253
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:48,769
Scott: and somehow they still were able to spam me in my mail and email box incessantly and it was hard to unsubscribe but I did succeed at doing it.

254
00:14:50,824 --> 00:14:56,458
Rym: I remember back in the day when Radio Shack would ask for your zip code and fucking wouldn't sell you things unless you gave it to them.

255
00:14:58,408 --> 00:14:59,199
Rym: so yeah you got any news?

256
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:00,639
Scott: I do have a news.

257
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:08,777
Scott: so in case you're living under a nerdy rock I don't know how any nerd doesn't know about this but AGDQ is happening right the hell.

258
00:15:08,797 --> 00:15:17,280
Scott: now awesome games done quick and if you are sitting there and you're like I've heard of this GDQ thing it's not up my alley I don't really care.

259
00:15:19,182 --> 00:15:22,233
Scott: yesterday yesterday they had a run.

260
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,019
Scott: was it yesterday or two days ago?

261
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,470
Rym: I don't watch them live that often.

262
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,179
Rym: it was yesterday.

263
00:15:30,185 --> 00:15:33,260
Scott: they had a run of Mike Tyson's punch out.

264
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,105
Scott: now we've seen Mike Tyson's punch out at GDQ several times.

265
00:15:36,145 --> 00:15:37,799
Scott: we saw people beat it really fast.

266
00:15:38,425 --> 00:15:40,659
Scott: we saw people beat it blindfolded.

267
00:15:41,425 --> 00:15:45,926
Scott: so this time they had people beat it 2P 1C.

268
00:15:45,966 --> 00:15:46,774
Scott: that's two people.

269
00:15:46,895 --> 00:15:47,420
Scott: one controller.

270
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:48,580
Scott: that is nuts.

271
00:15:48,884 --> 00:15:51,500
Scott: one person's got the arrows one person's got the buttons.

272
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:55,940
Scott: I think the way you do this is you master it on your own.

273
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:57,560
Scott: the other person masters it on their own.

274
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,686
Scott: you master it with the same techniques.

275
00:16:01,844 --> 00:16:14,198
Scott: then you just put one of your hands in your pocket and you imagine yourself pushing the buttons on both sides of the controller but only one of your hands is actually touching the controller and the other person's doing the same thing.

276
00:16:14,743 --> 00:16:20,149
Scott: and much like Evangelion episode DDR whatever that is you beat punch out 9?

277
00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:22,281
Rym: was it episode 9?

278
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:26,520
Scott: regardless what was fascinating was not that they managed to do this.

279
00:16:26,763 --> 00:16:28,082
Rym: it was episode 9.

280
00:16:28,082 --> 00:16:29,159
Scott: I'm a fucking nerd.

281
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:34,779
Scott: the point is they added a little twist.

282
00:16:35,569 --> 00:16:38,076
Scott: they did a 2P 1C and blindfolded.

283
00:16:39,142 --> 00:16:39,466
Scott: both.

284
00:16:39,527 --> 00:16:41,705
Rym: people blindfolded 2P 1C.

285
00:16:42,721 --> 00:16:48,000
Scott: they beat Mike Tyson's punch out something I cannot do 1P 1C eyes open.

286
00:16:48,324 --> 00:16:49,440
Rym: I love Mike Tyson's punch out.

287
00:16:49,562 --> 00:16:50,959
Scott: I've never actually beaten it.

288
00:16:51,121 --> 00:17:00,959
Scott: I can sometimes beat Sandman and super macho man usually takes me down and if I use the password to go to Mike Tyson I basically can't beat him.

289
00:17:01,403 --> 00:17:09,078
Rym: I can knock him down I can beat him but I only ever beat him by taking a password directly to him.

290
00:17:09,905 --> 00:17:12,339
Rym: I've never beaten the entire game in one go ever.

291
00:17:12,421 --> 00:17:13,819
Rym: I don't think I ever could.

292
00:17:14,866 --> 00:17:26,660
Rym: I'm pretty good but not real good though I was getting so paranoid because as I'm older I play a lot of DDR but there's two songs that I have been able to pass that I cannot pass anymore.

293
00:17:27,261 --> 00:17:34,399
Rym: but last night I actually almost passed max 300 again so I might be getting it back but I'm training real hard.

294
00:17:35,202 --> 00:17:41,219
Rym: yeah GDQ is amazing and you should appreciate the craft even if you do not like video games or speed running.

295
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:52,350
Rym: so I guess it's time for Things of the Day.

296
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:53,910
Rym: I thought mine's pretty funny.

297
00:17:53,951 --> 00:17:56,169
Rym: I like my Thing of the Day a lot but Scott's is way better.

298
00:17:56,472 --> 00:17:58,930
Scott: I see Star Trek which I don't watch.

299
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:04,468
Rym: I like Star Trek but basically I recently rewatched all of Star Trek Voyager just like I watched it all.

300
00:18:04,892 --> 00:18:23,370
Rym: so I've seen every episode of Voyager fairly recently and this is a video that is just Star Trek Voyager out of context and it is edited so well and it has good sets of recurring themes that it's actually really funny to watch whether or not you have seen Star Trek Voyager.

301
00:18:23,471 --> 00:18:29,188
Rym: so I encourage you, particularly if you have never seen Star Trek Voyager to watch this video.

302
00:18:30,978 --> 00:18:31,508
Rym: so what do you got?

303
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:41,976
Scott: so here's some people in an office somewhere, it's clearly not in the United States because they're not speaking the English but they have some issue with their computer monitors.

304
00:18:42,077 --> 00:18:46,669
Scott: and this is not a faked thing, this isn't like some kind of setup or anything like that, right?

305
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,529
Scott: this is like a real deal.

306
00:18:49,634 --> 00:18:59,650
Scott: whenever they sit in this chair and then stand up from the chair the monitors like go cancel out and then have to reboot all the monitors.

307
00:18:59,954 --> 00:19:08,047
Rym: now at first I was like is it just some like power saving bullshit in this office, nothing like that like it's just a normal office chair.

308
00:19:09,647 --> 00:19:12,890
Scott: so what's the deal going on here?

309
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:19,989
Scott: apparently they're using some sort of display link hardware, display link makes I guess video stuff.

310
00:19:21,057 --> 00:19:23,029
Scott: I don't know, I've never used any of their hardware.

311
00:19:24,113 --> 00:19:27,007
Scott: wireless VR technology yeah something like that, I don't know.

312
00:19:27,573 --> 00:19:33,130
Scott: and this display link hardware is not shielded properly from interference.

313
00:19:33,735 --> 00:19:37,930
Scott: so the electrical pulse of some kind, maybe static electricity related.

314
00:19:37,971 --> 00:19:43,769
Rym: oh yeah, reading this bug thing when people stand or sit on gas lift chairs which is any modern chair?

315
00:19:44,174 --> 00:19:48,614
Scott: you know the chairs that go up and down with the lever, that's a gas lift chair they can

316
00:19:48,674 --> 00:19:50,150
Rym: generate an EMI spike

317
00:19:50,473 --> 00:20:05,930
Scott: yes, that minor spike from going up or down in the gas lift chair of certain kinds too quickly causes some electricity in the air and that makes these monitors fuck up because the display link hardware sucks.

318
00:20:06,556 --> 00:20:10,489
Scott: so don't buy display link crap, and also this is hilarious.

319
00:20:11,492 --> 00:20:12,950
Scott: it's hilarious because it's not fake.

320
00:20:13,696 --> 00:20:17,950
Scott: you'd expect someone to do this like a practical joke like they wire, put something in someone's chair.

321
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:23,646
Scott: but no, this is totally just a real bug, there's the bug report on the display link website, they admit it.

322
00:20:24,112 --> 00:20:26,290
Rym: that's amazing I wouldn't admit it.

323
00:20:27,803 --> 00:20:35,090
Scott: so in the meta moment it's the entire rest of the show right, so that's at least for the meta moment section, talk about the immediate meta.

324
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:38,350
Rym: so first, we were just at magfest, we did not video our panels.

325
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:38,594
Rym: we were lazy.

326
00:20:40,013 --> 00:20:46,070
Rym: yep, mostly we were lazy, but also they were either repeats or they were like panel panels and they were all pretty good.

327
00:20:46,374 --> 00:21:00,069
Rym: it was a great magfest, but I will be posting the slides for the real harm of games because the doctor who joined us added several citations that are fantastic and further solidify that we are right.

328
00:21:02,056 --> 00:21:06,470
Rym: we also did a brand new panel that we're going to tweak based on feedback and based on how it went the first time.

329
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:07,110
Rym: I think it went pretty well.

330
00:21:07,171 --> 00:21:12,309
Scott: we threw a panel together like slapdash that hopefully we'll do it again and then we'll record and put it online.

331
00:21:12,491 --> 00:21:18,068
Rym: yep, but I'm going to change some points, tweak some slides, I realized some things about the panel, I think we can tighten it up pretty well.

332
00:21:19,113 --> 00:21:20,630
Rym: but I might post for the patreon.

333
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:22,370
Rym: patreons, I did record.

334
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:23,590
Rym: I was doing it just on OBS.

335
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:28,590
Rym: so I think I'm going to post that to the patreon so you can see what an early gig night's panel.

336
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:29,989
Scott: so you can have audio and slides.

337
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:38,888
Rym: audio and slides, and also because I just did it for my own edification because the projector was actually a weird resolution and I didn't check that because I didn't care because we weren't making video.

338
00:21:39,434 --> 00:21:45,445
Rym: the slides are cropped and zoomed in weird just because the projector was like a weird aspect ratio and resolution.

339
00:21:45,486 --> 00:21:49,745
Scott: for some reason we're going to peck south, but we're just doing another one of those 40 whatever.

340
00:21:50,371 --> 00:21:54,509
Rym: so the deal is we're doing the 41 tabletop games you must play.

341
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:59,269
Scott: but the deal is we never even finish all 40 when we do these things.

342
00:21:59,572 --> 00:22:01,389
Rym: yeah we do, we only failed once.

343
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:02,870
Scott: you should change it to 30 something.

344
00:22:02,991 --> 00:22:21,549
Rym: well the difference is, the panel we do the 40 X games you should play, the deal is always here is a wide variety of games that will like force you to touch every kind of gaming like chess nerd, play magic magic nerd, play any other game like that kind of thing, play these foundational games that teach you something.

345
00:22:22,014 --> 00:22:26,050
Rym: but this is, we cannot talk about any game we've talked about in that panel.

346
00:22:26,414 --> 00:22:28,415
Rym: it's just, there's too many games out.

347
00:22:28,455 --> 00:22:39,509
Scott: now, here's a list of games that we think are worth playing for some reason since we're not doing one of the meaningful panels, I also don't know if we should record this one.

348
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:41,250
Rym: we definitely should because it's all new content.

349
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:45,149
Scott: it's not all new content, we've done this panel how many times already?

350
00:22:45,331 --> 00:22:48,849
Rym: it's 100% different games from any version of this panel we've ever done ever?

351
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:54,870
Rym: also people really like these panels because you forget we see all the games and we like.

352
00:22:55,133 --> 00:22:56,529
Rym: we know a lot about games.

353
00:22:56,953 --> 00:23:00,128
Rym: most gamers don't know what games to play, they really need help.

354
00:23:01,294 --> 00:23:07,310
Rym: go to BoardGameGeek and look at the top 20. that is not going to give you a good time not today, go find some YouTube.

355
00:23:07,371 --> 00:23:08,529
Rym: shouty men, come to us.

356
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:10,405
Rym: we're just podcast.

357
00:23:10,425 --> 00:23:10,869
Rym: shouty men.

358
00:23:11,274 --> 00:23:12,230
Rym: YouTube is secondary.

359
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:16,489
Scott: so anyway, that's pretty much all the book club book.

360
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:18,250
Rym: Tale of Genji, yes I'm reading it again.

361
00:23:18,613 --> 00:23:21,909
Scott: I reread chapter 1 on the train.

362
00:23:23,074 --> 00:23:24,830
Scott: it's going to take a while but it's coming.

363
00:23:24,951 --> 00:23:27,350
Rym: we're going to do some sub episodes of the Tale of Genji.

364
00:23:27,836 --> 00:23:34,029
Rym: we're both going to read for a while and at some point in the next month or two we'll probably do an episode up to a certain point.

365
00:23:35,576 --> 00:23:39,770
Rym: all I want to say is Genji's actually kind of a piece of shit at least in the beginning.

366
00:23:40,094 --> 00:23:46,390
Scott: it's the first novel ever in the history of humanity is the oldest possible novel.

367
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:58,909
Scott: there are older writings clearly but those older writings were not novels like The Odyssey, not a novel nope, it's an oral story oral storytelling or an oral tradition, an epic poem.

368
00:23:59,314 --> 00:24:16,869
Rym: every year around Christmas I usually read some non-fiction about World War I I'm weird, Christmas truths and all that and this year I picked a pretty thorough history of World War I instead of a shorter thing but I finished it a little while ago.

369
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:18,909
Rym: so now I'm diving back into the Tale of Genji.

370
00:24:20,554 --> 00:24:26,488
Rym: all I really learned from this book other than a lot of details that will really help me in some of the games I might play with Chris at some point.

371
00:24:28,379 --> 00:24:31,568
Rym: you might think the early learning of World War.

372
00:24:31,689 --> 00:24:33,970
Rym: I you think, well yeah, Germany caused the war.

373
00:24:34,254 --> 00:24:35,349
Rym: Germany was mostly a fault.

374
00:24:35,754 --> 00:24:39,390
Rym: and then you think, well no the European power is a complicated thing.

375
00:24:39,512 --> 00:24:40,227
Scott: everyone was at fault.

376
00:24:40,793 --> 00:24:47,130
Rym: but galaxy brain, no, Germany was like 90% at fault fucking Germany.

377
00:24:48,515 --> 00:24:54,450
Rym: it's like that Simpsons episode where Lisa causes the trouble and Marge is like, Bart, no and Bart's like, what'd I do?

378
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,670
Rym: and she's like, sorry, farce that happened.

379
00:24:56,216 --> 00:25:02,890
Rym: when it comes to World War III it'll be like, Germany, no, oh, sorry I don't think it'll be Germany.

380
00:25:03,132 --> 00:25:08,970
Rym: no, Germany's like if shit goes real bad, Germany's where people have to flee to to stage the resistance.

381
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:12,530
Rym: ironic yeah, quite I feel like Germany learned its lesson.

382
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:14,705
Rym: they got all the World Wars out of their system anyway.

383
00:25:16,572 --> 00:25:18,570
Scott: GeekNights is a podcast.

384
00:25:18,812 --> 00:25:22,089
Scott: GeekNights is 15. it depends how you measure, right?

385
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:30,587
Rym: because the first non-beta GeekNights was Halloween 2005 and funnily enough I found this on December 1st.

386
00:25:32,211 --> 00:25:35,390
Rym: we recorded an episode that we called Meta.

387
00:25:35,491 --> 00:25:37,510
Scott: I think that was about the concept of meta.

388
00:25:38,132 --> 00:25:38,597
Scott: No!

389
00:25:38,739 --> 00:25:41,248
Rym: Tonight on GeekNights we talk about GeekNights itself.

390
00:25:42,755 --> 00:25:45,550
Scott: that was basically at the very start of GeekNights.

391
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:47,350
Scott: I wonder what the hell we said.

392
00:25:47,672 --> 00:25:50,150
Rym: I'm gonna link to it, I don't know what we said.

393
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:52,369
Scott: I probably should have listened to that before we did this episode.

394
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:55,468
Rym: it's kind of better if we don't because I think what I want to do is do this show.

395
00:25:56,276 --> 00:25:57,225
Rym: so this is 15 years.

396
00:25:58,732 --> 00:26:01,175
Scott: it's hard to say if it's 14 or 15 or if 2020 is our 15th year.

397
00:26:02,891 --> 00:26:04,390
Scott: I mean technically it's pointless.

398
00:26:04,531 --> 00:26:06,750
Scott: it doesn't matter because it's the start of a new decade.

399
00:26:06,871 --> 00:26:08,826
Scott: but no it's not until it's 20. whatever.

400
00:26:09,051 --> 00:26:23,108
Rym: look, we started a podcast in the early days of podcasting back in 2005. somehow it's 2020 and almost no one who was podcasting when we started is still podcasting.

401
00:26:23,513 --> 00:26:25,427
Scott: there are some, anyway not many.

402
00:26:26,275 --> 00:26:30,450
Rym: also even the people who are still podcasting have not been podcasting that often.

403
00:26:30,775 --> 00:26:41,582
Rym: we've done more like we're podcasting less often over time yeah, but we've consistently done two episodes a week except during the holidays for most of that time and we did do four episodes a week.

404
00:26:41,602 --> 00:26:43,470
Rym: until what, like 2009?

405
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:48,350
Rym: yeah, anyway the point is we've been podcasting for a long goddamn time.

406
00:26:48,431 --> 00:27:02,110
Scott: right now we're gonna make a turning point in the GeekNights way and so let us take this opportunity to discuss the ghosts of past, present, and future.

407
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:19,730
Rym: yup so we started this podcast because we had nothing else to do yeah, so we graduated college and that's a tough time for a lot of people especially in the US because you go from an environment surrounded by all your closest friends you have basically zero responsibilities.

408
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:26,350
Scott: well it depends what your college, I've come to realize not everyone was so privileged and lucky to have that kind of college experience.

409
00:27:26,673 --> 00:27:28,650
Rym: I think it's partly because we went to a college.

410
00:27:28,832 --> 00:27:46,945
Scott: even people who did go to people lucky enough to go to college right didn't necessarily have that experience where they went, and then a lot of people the high school was that experience for them, and they're still with their high school friends, even if they had a high school experience like that they were lucky enough to have that.

411
00:27:48,513 --> 00:27:59,269
Rym: but yeah, we were lucky enough to have them and it was a combination of privilege of going to the school the fact that the school was actually pretty physically isolated and none of us had cars.

412
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:06,810
Rym: well I intentionally, that's what I sought out me too, I wanted to get the fuck away from my whole life and go somewhere new and be an adult.

413
00:28:06,971 --> 00:28:17,449
Scott: I had already had the summer camp experience and I was like, going to college I was pretty much imagining going to summer camp but I'm like, man, I gotta go somewhere with nerds.

414
00:28:18,218 --> 00:28:20,730
Scott: and that was my plan and my plan totally came through.

415
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:24,790
Scott: I was like, gonna go somewhere and make a bunch of nerdy friends and finally get to play a bunch of battle tech.

416
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:25,809
Scott: and it totally happened.

417
00:28:26,012 --> 00:28:35,470
Rym: a bunch of other stuff, there was also a time a setting situation, exactly as I foreseen we entered college pre-cellphone and left college post-cellphone.

418
00:28:35,835 --> 00:28:43,150
Rym: we went to college pre-bit torrent and left post-bit torrent pre-youtube post-youtube pre-facebook post-facebook.

419
00:28:43,251 --> 00:28:49,050
Rym: yeah, like we, Orkut came out and we were like, whoa what is this thing?

420
00:28:49,373 --> 00:28:54,989
Scott: what is a social network, hot shit like, we came in with Eamonn ICQ and he left with Eamonn ICQ.

421
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:57,090
Scott: yep, it was a little bit.

422
00:28:58,055 --> 00:29:01,310
Scott: we'd know some Jabber kinda Google hangouts shortly thereafter.

423
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:09,450
Scott: yep, we didn't adopt Twitter right away which came way after Twitter came way after college Twitter, GeekNights is older than Twitter.

424
00:29:09,773 --> 00:29:11,829
Rym: yeah, GeekNights is older than a lot of things.

425
00:29:11,931 --> 00:29:12,424
Rym: that's right.

426
00:29:14,178 --> 00:29:20,029
Rym: but that setting like, and the other crazy thing I saw recently, someone was talking about The Wonder Years that TV show, remember that show?

427
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:33,190
Rym: so, when that show was on yeah, so when that show was on TV the era it depicted was from the past like it depicted an era from the past.

428
00:29:33,493 --> 00:29:37,929
Rym: and when you watch that show, like when I watched The Wonder Years, it felt like it was depicting an ancient time.

429
00:29:39,013 --> 00:29:47,695
Rym: if The Wonder Years were produced today, it literally covers the five years we went to college, that's how long ago that was, by like cultural standards,

430
00:29:47,877 --> 00:29:48,039
Scott: so

431
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:56,789
Rym: it was this right time and place to where, when I left college that left a deep hole in my day to day life.

432
00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:10,131
Scott: well I mean, here, shout out to any writers out there, write a Wonder Years 2. just don't even it doesn't have to be based on the actual thing or you have the same name, just make it about people in the year 2000 to 2005.

433
00:30:10,131 --> 00:30:22,281
Rym: yeah, like one of the episodes with the same format, just different names episode 43, Scott gets a cell phone because I remember when you got your cell phone, that was a big fucking deal like everyone was excited about it were they?

434
00:30:22,383 --> 00:30:23,989
Scott: okay yeah, because no one else had one.

435
00:30:25,553 --> 00:30:28,364
Rym: texting texting cost money.

436
00:30:28,425 --> 00:30:31,627
Scott: back then it mattered the most at conventions, I was the point man.

437
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,750
Rym: we used to bring walkie talkies on road trips.

438
00:30:34,016 --> 00:30:50,190
Rym: yeah, it's true anyway, so we left college like shit situated, we ended up in the mid Hudson Valley, we rented this house and we're living in this house, going to jobs and we'd like play five board games and watch a movie every night.

439
00:30:50,311 --> 00:30:52,946
Scott: right, we had a long commute, but we still got home and had nothing to do.

440
00:30:53,311 --> 00:30:56,522
Rym: well back then, I didn't have a long commute, I had a ten minute commute yeah, but we still had nothing to do.

441
00:30:56,542 --> 00:31:03,970
Scott: when we got home we'd make some kind of dinner, maybe go to the grocery which is far, actually maybe go out to eat or order food.

442
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:05,286
Scott: but yeah, we needed something to do.

443
00:31:06,597 --> 00:31:09,556
Rym: but we also missed the fact that we

444
00:31:09,597 --> 00:31:10,730
Scott: ran the RIT Anime Club

445
00:31:11,573 --> 00:31:28,629
Rym: and I was like on the executive board and while Scott never had an official role really, Scott was actually very important to running that club, you were like the shadow advisor, but we basically like, ran this club for a long time and it was actually a bigger part of our lives than we realized.

446
00:31:28,851 --> 00:31:43,550
Rym: it was weird to be, more for me than you I think, to be used to having an audience to be used to having fans like, I was used to like, any time I went outside at RIT to class, people would just bother me and be like, oh hey, Ram, oh, Ram it.

447
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:46,988
Rym: and now I was living in the normal world where no one gave a shit about me.

448
00:31:47,271 --> 00:31:53,870
Scott: well, I also, even less than that, having an audience, right I mean, audience is more my thing than your thing.

449
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:59,849
Scott: it was simply just having a social life immediately where you are at all times.

450
00:32:00,355 --> 00:32:07,550
Scott: so it's like, you know, that's why I like summer camp so much, it's like you're just hanging out with your friends, like, you think about a sleepover, kids love a sleepover.

451
00:32:07,772 --> 00:32:18,950
Scott: I love a sleepover now and I'm 37 you have a whole weekend with your friends, yeah summer camp is a fucking eight weeks sleepover, right, so you know, college is four years sleepover.

452
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:23,490
Rym: why do you think we're so obsessed with conventions, because conventions are that life for three to five days.

453
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:31,070
Scott: right, you get all your people together to have a good time for an extended time, which means you can do things that take longer, like play battle tech.

454
00:32:31,651 --> 00:32:43,207
Rym: so we basically, sort of have an anime marathon, so for a lot of different reasons, we ended up basically trying to make our own community on the internet around ourselves just to get all these things.

455
00:32:43,267 --> 00:32:47,310
Scott: we were missing, oh, we also, you know, we tried to get our friends also to come a lot.

456
00:32:47,612 --> 00:33:01,249
Rym: yep, we actually used to try to get a lot of our friends to be on GeekNights, to do sideshows to make content, and basically no one we knew was able to do it consistently or reliably except us, for a lot of reasons.

457
00:33:02,133 --> 00:33:09,729
Rym: so we gave up on that over time but we just kept doing it, and one thing, you know, I really I think it started out as we have nothing else to do.

458
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:20,338
Scott: yep, right, and we discovered, like the iPod Nano came out, we saw what a pod, we were like, oh, that's what a podcast is, we were in the perfect two white guys position to make one, yep,

459
00:33:20,358 --> 00:33:21,954
Rym: we had money, free time no responsibilities,

460
00:33:21,974 --> 00:33:23,910
Scott: we had time, technology, and knowledge.

461
00:33:24,193 --> 00:33:28,189
Scott: yeah, because remember, we had the computer knowledge, the audio knowledge and we had big mouths.

462
00:33:28,452 --> 00:33:37,208
Rym: I hope we talk about this in this meta episode from 2005 because the only reason GeekNights got as good as it did, because it got pretty good because you took some class at RIT.

463
00:33:37,895 --> 00:33:45,796
Rym: well, not just that, I was in I was into audio engineering from like elementary school on, like I was making mix tapes I was fucking around with reel to reels, I had mixers, making

464
00:33:45,816 --> 00:33:47,936
Scott: a mix tape on your Fisher Price recorder doesn't count,

465
00:33:48,199 --> 00:33:52,159
Rym: no, I was like making mix tapes by, I had like dubbing equipment,

466
00:33:52,844 --> 00:33:54,310
Scott: you made a stereo with two cassettes.

467
00:33:55,393 --> 00:34:08,547
Rym: I had multiple stereos that I linked together and I would like crossfade songs and make mixes on cassettes, I started learning mastering, I learned a lot about audio and then in college, I like doubled down and learned audio engineering, I went to, I took several classes on that.

468
00:34:09,753 --> 00:34:13,230
Rym: I mean, I did, two more than two, pretty sure it was like two.

469
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:15,049
Rym: I took three, it was three classes.

470
00:34:15,897 --> 00:34:27,110
Rym: one of them was digital music, I remember only one, because music theory one and two also covered music production and media production, and also I did, you're counting the music theory class, cause they covered this stuff.

471
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:37,250
Rym: and also in high school I mastered like the audio and even recorded a lot of my friends shitty bands anyway, I played in some bands, they were shitty.

472
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:37,411
Rym: the

473
00:34:37,431 --> 00:34:39,170
Scott: point is, we had enough knowledge

474
00:34:39,291 --> 00:34:39,371
Rym: of

475
00:34:39,493 --> 00:34:41,755
Scott: audio and plenty of knowledge of computer,

476
00:34:41,775 --> 00:34:42,485
Rym: cause back then, I

477
00:34:42,505 --> 00:34:47,697
Scott: had actually made a podcast earlier and didn't realize it was a podcast, I had like a blog

478
00:34:47,737 --> 00:34:48,322
Rym: in college

479
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:53,090
Scott: and I was like, huh, what if I record like a WAV file of me talking and upload it to the blog?

480
00:34:53,130 --> 00:35:00,730
Scott: there wasn't RSS, I think there was RSS but there wasn't like the embed tag that would make it automatically work, but I did do that, that might be.

481
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:10,649
Rym: I don't know if that was the oldest podcast on earth, but it was old yup, but that like, precursor knowledge we had was important, cause when we started, podcasting was pretty new.

482
00:35:11,173 --> 00:35:19,030
Rym: there were a lot of people, mostly professionals who had audio skills, but they didn't have anything to say, and they didn't know how to make technology work, a lot of people had things to say.

483
00:35:19,293 --> 00:35:26,509
Scott: we could do all the things on our own all three things we could do like, I already knew what a compressor was and we had nothing else to do, so we did them all.

484
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:44,450
Rym: yup, and that's partly why like, in those early days, like within a month, Geek Guides format is like, locked down and pretty tight and within two months, our audio sounds fucking great, compared to listen to any other podcast from 2007, even professional ones kinda sound like shit.

485
00:35:44,591 --> 00:35:46,933
Scott: yeah, we also had money, cause we were living cheap,

486
00:35:47,196 --> 00:36:06,210
Rym: yup, but not that much money, we, it was like we had all analog mixing equipment, like the mix, like the pipeline to make Geek Guides like, was literally an analog mixer, mixing down in all analog pipeline meaning if anything went wrong, the recording was fucked to a Linux box, running.

487
00:36:07,435 --> 00:36:14,590
Rym: what was it, Audacity not Audition, not Audacity, it was Resound, I I defy you to make that software work in 2020.

488
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:14,611
Rym: I

489
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:18,128
Scott: don't think it exists, no, I mean you could probably get it cause it's open source, but I refuse

490
00:36:18,148 --> 00:36:19,770
Rym: to use Audacity because it sucked

491
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:27,177
Scott: anyway, so that was what that was what GeekNights started, also the convention panel thing is actually older than GeekNights, yeah,

492
00:36:27,197 --> 00:36:28,490
Rym: we were doing convention panels.

493
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:41,710
Scott: we did the panels before GeekNights, 2002 but it was me doing them by myself until 2004, right, and then as soon as we had the GeekNights, we were like, well, we're going to these conventions and we just submitted applications to do conventions.

494
00:36:42,154 --> 00:36:46,050
Scott: we had a resume of ones we had done before, and we just tacked on.

495
00:36:46,191 --> 00:36:50,370
Scott: oh, we're from this podcast, we want to do these panels, and we've done them before.

496
00:36:50,713 --> 00:36:59,906
Scott: so people accepted us, which increased the resume, which allowed us to do more which allowed us to do more, and then it was 2008, when we were like, let's go to PAX.

497
00:37:00,391 --> 00:37:04,170
Scott: we always wanted to go to it, since it existed, but we didn't have enough money for that.

498
00:37:04,271 --> 00:37:08,049
Rym: we spent it all on microphones, one of my biggest regrets in life is not going to PAX.

499
00:37:08,191 --> 00:37:18,929
Rym: a year or two earlier, I should have made it happen hitchhike, but basically, we back then, PAX did not have the concept of fan panels.

500
00:37:19,933 --> 00:37:21,770
Scott: there weren't a lot of panels, period.

501
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:37,709
Rym: the way to submit a panel to PAX was like reach out to them, and I basically was like, hey we are these podcasters here's our resume, here are credentials, we want to talk about this topic at your convention let's talk, and they said okay.

502
00:37:37,972 --> 00:37:41,230
Scott: and they said okay every single time since then, that we have asked.

503
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:51,282
Rym: we have presented at every single PAX in North America since 2008, and two of the PAX Australias and

504
00:37:51,343 --> 00:37:55,953
Scott: if we had gone to the other Australias, because they don't pay for us to go there, or our hotel again,

505
00:37:55,994 --> 00:38:03,510
Rym: the privilege of money, we can buy we can pay for all the things that for, if you're given access to take advantage of that access.

506
00:38:05,223 --> 00:38:09,890
Scott: so yeah we did that, over time we added and removed various conventions.

507
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:17,150
Rym: we used to do a lot more cons, which was sadly one thing, that's actually, when we stopped doing a lot of smaller cons.

508
00:38:17,251 --> 00:38:29,530
Scott: I think we did more cons in the earlier days because when we were in Beacon Upstate we had car, so we would drive to a Katsucon or we would drive to, right, we would drive to these other cons, but that was part of what was driving our growth.

509
00:38:29,631 --> 00:38:32,841
Rym: we had more listeners then, like as a percentage of the podcast market.

510
00:38:32,861 --> 00:38:39,390
Scott: then we do now by far who knows, but the point is we drove, so we'd go to other conventions even small ones, with our car.

511
00:38:39,571 --> 00:38:50,490
Scott: now, that we're only in a city with no car, we go to the conventions that are in big cities and since we don't have a lot of time we go to the ones that we only go to the biggest conventions.

512
00:38:50,671 --> 00:38:53,990
Scott: we only go to ones that we would go to if we were only attendees.

513
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:57,870
Scott: because we went to Anime Boston I think the longest of the non-gaming cons.

514
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:00,688
Rym: but it got to the point where going to Anime Boston was like going to a job.

515
00:39:01,357 --> 00:39:14,356
Scott: it's like we went to it except for a few things that we did there like concerts, anime hell, the panels that we were on, walk around the dealer's room once we spent the rest of the time fiddling about, not doing much like basically

516
00:39:14,376 --> 00:39:16,010
Rym: sit in the green room, wait for our next panel.

517
00:39:16,575 --> 00:39:18,169
Rym: wish we'd submitted more panels.

518
00:39:18,554 --> 00:39:32,409
Scott: we spent a lot of time there, not, you know the expense of going, even though they were very good and they would pay us to go, they were great and it was great as an anime con, I'm sure it still is the hassle of doing it, plus our friends stopped going.

519
00:39:33,254 --> 00:39:34,670
Rym: well that's something that really happened.

520
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:56,907
Rym: our friends over time, even our close friends stopped going to almost all conventions like Magfest is the last one that a lot of our friends go to, and increasingly we have this like, two sets we have like the friends that go to Magfest and otherwise don't go to cons that we only see at like friend events, then we have this other set of friends that we see at those things, but we also see at all the PAXes.

521
00:39:57,634 --> 00:40:19,829
Scott: our friend group started as the college friend group, but largely thanks to GeekNights it succeeded in creating another friend group that merged, and to the point at which it doesn't at least to us, since we're at the center of the social circle, it doesn't feel like two different groups, but when you look at the list of like, here's the list of all my friends and I look at it, and it's like

522
00:40:20,132 --> 00:40:22,209
Rym: people who fly to every PAX and people who don't.

523
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:23,808
Scott: well it's like RIT, RIT.

524
00:40:24,071 --> 00:40:27,449
Scott: I met them because of GeekNights, I met them at a convention, I met, right?

525
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:37,248
Scott: And it's like, these are all equally close friends that are basically family and some of them are from college and some of them are from GeekNights convention meeting, right?

526
00:40:37,873 --> 00:40:46,130
Scott: Because we had all those things we were able to form this you know, this group Yeah, so we actually succeeded in a lot of our goals.

527
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:52,060
Rym: like GeekNights is not crazy popular partly because we've never really tried like, we don't do ads, we haven't tried to monetize.

528
00:40:52,585 --> 00:41:00,338
Rym: we never went pro, like We bought ads crappy banner ads once but we didn't really push it.

529
00:41:00,641 --> 00:41:04,720
Rym: but yet it's still like just word of mouth and content alone, like GeekNights is pretty popular.

530
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,540
Scott: More than zero people pay attention.

531
00:41:06,802 --> 00:41:13,579
Rym: Yeah, like, I got almost 10,000 people just on the YouTube, though weirdly most of the people who watch the YouTube don't seem to know we do a podcast.

532
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:25,732
Scott: Anyway, so the point is, is that you know, for pretty much all the 2010s the whole past decade we pretty much like just carried on with habit, right?

533
00:41:26,014 --> 00:41:33,458
Scott: We didn't really try hard or change much or right, like we just kept doing what we were doing.

534
00:41:33,721 --> 00:41:39,218
Rym: We got better at doing what we were doing but we weren't doing new things like, we kept doing the convention

535
00:41:39,238 --> 00:41:42,940
Scott: panels We didn't change the format, you know, we started uploading more things to YouTube

536
00:41:43,523 --> 00:41:48,195
Rym: We started doing more video, and when we get to the future bit, we'll talk about that, because we're going to start doing

537
00:41:48,215 --> 00:41:48,820
Scott: a lot more video.

538
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:55,020
Scott: We tried to do a few things, like the pony show and the antenna show Which were really popular, like really popular.

539
00:41:55,944 --> 00:42:05,977
Rym: but at the same time those things take a lot of effort and normal people do one thing like that, and that's their whole hobby like, most people will do a pony YouTube channel and that's it.

540
00:42:07,504 --> 00:42:12,740
Rym: We're still doing GeekNights and we tried to do a pony show at the same time with the same production value.

541
00:42:12,983 --> 00:42:19,267
Scott: Well, the other problem is that we got GeekNights to this point where, you know, it doesn't take effort to make it.

542
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:22,880
Scott: We can just sit down and it is created without any work.

543
00:42:23,345 --> 00:42:25,248
Rym: Ever wonder why we rarely have guests on the show?

544
00:42:25,936 --> 00:42:28,639
Scott: Most people We want to have lots of guests on the show.

545
00:42:28,984 --> 00:42:29,960
Rym: You know why we don't have guest hosts?

546
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:40,989
Rym: Because unless you are a professional at the three things that we're professionals at, it takes like four to twelve times more effort and time to make a show to what.

547
00:42:41,009 --> 00:42:41,659
Rym: that includes you.

548
00:42:42,002 --> 00:42:50,560
Scott: The amount of time to make a GeekNights is the amount of time it takes for us to sit down, talk push a few extra buttons.

549
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:57,493
Rym: Sometimes I should record the post production process, like what it looks like today and it's looked like that for more than a decade.

550
00:42:57,553 --> 00:43:00,319
Rym: Like, even when we were living in Beacon, I had this crazy.

551
00:43:00,582 --> 00:43:05,632
Rym: You didn't have Creative Cloud then No, but I had a crazy Python script that I would run.

552
00:43:06,381 --> 00:43:08,520
Rym: We'd finish GeekNights, I'd run this script.

553
00:43:08,864 --> 00:43:11,350
Rym: It would edit the show together like, do everything.

554
00:43:11,815 --> 00:43:12,360
Rym: It was amazing.

555
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,100
Scott: But the point is, we can't do video that way.

556
00:43:14,201 --> 00:43:20,020
Scott: Video actually takes a lot of labor which is why I've fallen behind on doing any anime judging.

557
00:43:21,361 --> 00:43:29,079
Scott: I've managed to streamlight that quite a bit and I have ideas a way to streamline it more to make it less work, but it's still a lot of work.

558
00:43:30,161 --> 00:43:31,380
Scott: It's time consuming.

559
00:43:31,622 --> 00:43:40,480
Rym: The only reason GeekNights takes zero effort is that we actually spent months designing our pipeline and building it out.

560
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,140
Scott: It's not just the technological production.

561
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:46,625
Rym: We designed things like, once we figured out the format, we were like, how do we make the format work?

562
00:43:46,787 --> 00:43:47,559
Rym: How do we transition?

563
00:43:47,981 --> 00:44:01,399
Scott: It's also that we can just sit down with no preparation no writing, no anything and as long as we come up with an idea which is the hard part, we can just immediately start talking and just push record and talk.

564
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,899
Rym: and honestly, at conventions, we can do that too.

565
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,599
Scott: If we bring another person, they can't do that.

566
00:44:05,922 --> 00:44:16,940
Rym: Nope, you should see when we interview people or even bring them on the show, I won't name any names just because I'm not going to be mean but we've had some great shows with guest hosts or people on the show that we've interviewed.

567
00:44:17,384 --> 00:44:18,758
Scott: Not many, but good ones.

568
00:44:21,523 --> 00:44:28,880
Rym: I remember an interview we did once, it took me four hours just to edit them so they didn't sound stupid.

569
00:44:29,244 --> 00:44:31,375
Rym: They're very smart, but they're not good at this.

570
00:44:33,041 --> 00:44:40,059
Scott: and also, it's like we can just sit down whenever I just show up and we do it.

571
00:44:40,322 --> 00:44:42,718
Scott: if we bring in more people we have to schedule it.

572
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:48,359
Scott: schedule at a specific time which makes the whole thing more time consuming even if they can just talk.

573
00:44:49,668 --> 00:44:51,580
Scott: it fits right into your day.

574
00:44:51,742 --> 00:44:52,106
Scott: if you just

575
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:52,733
Rym: show

576
00:44:52,834 --> 00:45:04,040
Scott: up and record when you happen to show up and then leave as soon as you're done that doesn't really you don't lose a lot of time if you have a time, like we have to record with this person at seven and they're here for an hour.

577
00:45:04,121 --> 00:45:11,240
Scott: well now I need to make sure I show up before seven and spend time before waiting for them and setting up for them and then after we have to spend more time.

578
00:45:12,862 --> 00:45:17,009
Scott: it's exponential how difficult it is to add another person or even short form content.

579
00:45:18,502 --> 00:45:21,699
Rym: you remember a while ago I did that video "Why Five Nights at Freddy's is Scary".

580
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:37,026
Rym: that took ten times the effort of a GeekNights episode because one, I had to do research real research then, I didn't write a script I didn't use my teleprompter but I had to at least decide what I was going to say.

581
00:45:37,047 --> 00:45:42,579
Rym: so it would be a coherent visual and audio essay, it couldn't just be me bullshitting for an hour.

582
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:49,380
Rym: then I had to go play Five Nights at Freddy's for a week to get all the footage and assets that I needed.

583
00:45:49,804 --> 00:45:51,598
Rym: then I had to video it, and that was before.

584
00:45:51,618 --> 00:45:55,499
Rym: I had bought nice cameras and lights and things so it doesn't even look that good.

585
00:45:55,943 --> 00:45:59,640
Rym: and then I had to do the preprocess, postprocess and all the bullshit and then put it on YouTube.

586
00:46:00,262 --> 00:46:10,019
Rym: that took a long, it took me like two weeks to make that fucking video and honestly I could make a video like that once a week if I had a production crew and that was my full time job.

587
00:46:10,141 --> 00:46:13,839
Rym: I could make one like once a day but we both work full time.

588
00:46:14,503 --> 00:46:17,720
Rym: that's not changing in fact, another thing that's happened.

589
00:46:18,083 --> 00:46:20,920
Scott: someone wants to send me mad money or a winning lottery ticket or something.

590
00:46:22,248 --> 00:46:30,540
Rym: one thing that happened, I haven't talked about this a lot on the show because I work for a company where you can figure out where I work but it's good to keep a certain amount of separation.

591
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,238
Scott: there's so many things going on in the present, right?

592
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:33,800
Rym: yeah, one, the world's on fire.

593
00:46:33,922 --> 00:46:34,920
Scott: yes, the world's on fire.

594
00:46:35,762 --> 00:46:49,816
Rym: we're in a fucked up time right now where literal Nazis are like a real threat to American democracy and like the world order we may have to turn GeekNights into like Nazi killing radio, if necessary like, not gonna lie.

595
00:46:50,643 --> 00:46:54,939
Rym: I have contingency plans to leave the country if certain things happen over the next several years.

596
00:46:55,101 --> 00:46:58,539
Scott: Jim's plan is to run, Scott's plan is to fight Nazis.

597
00:46:59,145 --> 00:47:01,939
Scott: I will defend New York until probably I die.

598
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:05,240
Scott: I will die defending New York from Nazis.

599
00:47:05,382 --> 00:47:16,560
Rym: but I feel like Radio Free America is a skill that I could bring to the forefront more than like actually killing people if it came to like World War 3 like Nazi resistance.

600
00:47:16,903 --> 00:47:22,239
Scott: I don't mean, you know, even though my I can't do one push up, right, so how much of a I'm not exactly.

601
00:47:23,361 --> 00:47:25,431
Scott: I'm not exactly ready for Wolfenstein 3D.

602
00:47:26,303 --> 00:47:32,877
Scott: I'm just saying metaphorically, I will stay in New York and defend New York against whatever fire on Earth comes.

603
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:40,719
Rym: let's just say that we're in a very politically and socially fraught time and we're on the precipice of potentially very bad things.

604
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:48,600
Scott: right, whatever attacks New York be it flood, right or whatever I'm just thinking like, Seinfeld, neither rain nor sleet.

605
00:47:48,661 --> 00:47:51,820
Scott: no, it's the first one right, that is Scott's plan.

606
00:47:52,003 --> 00:48:06,399
Rym: yep, two of the worlds also literal fire but three, like I got a new job a few years ago and I'm very good at my work, like I've never had to work hard at any job I've ever had before.

607
00:48:06,682 --> 00:48:20,880
Rym: the job I have now is not that hard but it requires honestly more like mental effort while I'm at work than any job I have ever had just simply due to the sheer scope of my responsibilities.

608
00:48:21,564 --> 00:48:41,153
Rym: what that means is that for most of my life until a couple years ago I had a lot of like down time at work to think about GeekNights' production pipeline stuff so that I'd already done the thinking, so when I get home and I have to like make a video pipeline to do a video, I've already done the hard work but now, I do

609
00:48:41,658 --> 00:48:41,820
Scott: not.

610
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:43,660
Scott: yeah, but just at work you've only got the bad screen.

611
00:48:43,741 --> 00:48:45,040
Scott: you gotta go to home with the good screen.

612
00:48:45,363 --> 00:49:17,523
Rym: I barely even chat with our friends at work because I'm literally at work thinking about how do I solve this very complex political problem across six engineering teams and I have to think a lot at work, when previously when I had to work hard it was doing, because the thinking I'd already done all the thinking, so I don't have time at work to think about GeekNights' which means when I'm home, I can either do something that I'm already good at and produce something that I can deliver to all of you, or I can think about something but then I deliver nothing to you.

613
00:49:17,543 --> 00:49:22,740
Rym: I don't create anything I just build a precursor to create something different.

614
00:49:23,324 --> 00:49:31,866
Rym: so we've both I think been defaulting to creating the things that we can create and getting stuff out as opposed to building the pipeline to do something new.

615
00:49:32,714 --> 00:49:42,960
Scott: Anyway, so the present is pretty much that we've just maintained the status quo for a long time, but the world's on fire, and things in life are changing.

616
00:49:43,642 --> 00:49:46,719
Scott: but that doesn't mean we're just going to give up and be like, well, right, no.

617
00:49:47,242 --> 00:49:53,464
Rym: GeekNights' is way too big a part of our lives to stop any time in the next decade or two.

618
00:49:53,586 --> 00:49:55,888
Scott: At least my plan for the future.

619
00:49:55,908 --> 00:49:58,620
Rym: Let's get to the future because we've already gone on for almost an hour.

620
00:49:58,941 --> 00:50:02,800
Scott: We've got to do some changing, so this means changing all the things.

621
00:50:02,982 --> 00:50:04,359
Scott: but I don't think.

622
00:50:05,242 --> 00:50:15,610
Scott: previously, someone point one of our friends pointed this out to me and they were exactly right, is that previously we've always had sort of a. this is like, you know, computer, software engineer talk, right?

623
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:24,217
Scott: We've had a waterfall development model for GeekNights which is, what that means is you do plan, plan, plan, plan, plan, plan, plan.

624
00:50:24,682 --> 00:50:30,963
Scott: you do all your planning, then all your building, and you build the perfect thing and then you release it all.

625
00:50:31,023 --> 00:50:38,338
Rym: Which I think is our flaw, like that Five Nights at Freddy's video, if I just sat down at the webcam and just fucking did it like unscripted in one go

626
00:50:38,642 --> 00:50:47,149
Scott: right, now, if you look out in the world of people following that model even going to the moon doesn't follow that model, it was like they sort of did, right?

627
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:50,703
Scott: They built the whole rocket and then they launch it, but they took 11 rockets right?

628
00:50:50,764 --> 00:50:53,470
Scott: They incrementally developed right?

629
00:50:53,531 --> 00:50:55,900
Scott: And some of them didn't go very well, right?

630
00:50:57,023 --> 00:50:59,471
Scott: And there were other rockets besides those 11 but you get the idea, right?

631
00:50:59,774 --> 00:51:10,520
Scott: So I think what we had to do, and I've also, another thing I was discussing today, I forget where I read this so I can't link it, sadly, people were talking about, you know, shit talk which is something we've talked about in Ignite since the beginning.

632
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:11,551
Rym: I read that same article.

633
00:51:11,592 --> 00:51:18,320
Scott: you were talking about Shit talk and crab people, which is basically you talk about that thing you're going to do, I've got a plan for this project, you need to tell everyone about it, right?

634
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:22,842
Rym: But we've always had a role, we very rarely talk about things until we've actually started on them.

635
00:51:22,862 --> 00:51:49,407
Scott: Well, the thing is, I'm always in favor of being public, because I look at so many companies and things, keeping things unnecessarily private and secret, and I want to prove them wrong, that like, no, you don't have to keep things private and secret, you can be completely open about everything you're doing, and it won't somehow hurt you, your competitors won't steal your idea, like Apple could give us daily updates on like, you know, what the next iPhone's going to be, and it wouldn't hurt them at all, that's what I believe anyway Right?

636
00:51:49,589 --> 00:52:07,549
Scott: So I want to be that way, that I believe, to demonstrate that I'm right, but the thing is I learned that psychologically speaking, if you say what you're going to do, right, just like on a personal level, psychologically it makes you feel like you've done it, and now you're less likely to do it, and it's more likely to become shit talk.

637
00:52:07,973 --> 00:52:25,003
Scott: So I want to be open about plans and what we're thinking, but I also don't want to say, oh, we're going to like make a video show about this, and then end up not doing it or doing it less, because psychologically we now feel accomplished when we haven't accomplished anything.

638
00:52:25,023 --> 00:52:32,720
Rym: Which I think the point there is that right now, we're going to talk about vision and strategy, but we're not going to talk about specifics.

639
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:38,437
Scott: Right, and that's because actually I don't want to do any specific thing.

640
00:52:38,518 --> 00:52:43,690
Scott: I have so many ideas all the time for things, and I end up doing like none of them.

641
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:52,920
Scott: So my idea is, you know, starting now-ish, right, is why do we have to follow some format?

642
00:52:53,041 --> 00:53:00,174
Scott: where there's like, we have a show with a name, and it has episodes, or we have a thing, like a project, and we keep doing it.

643
00:53:00,235 --> 00:53:01,992
Rym: Look at the show, look at all those things.

644
00:53:02,033 --> 00:53:06,028
Rym: They still were like Radio Free Equestria, Episode 1, Episode 2, Episode 3.

645
00:53:06,028 --> 00:53:11,443
Scott: I'm just going to make whatever I feel like making whenever I feel like making it.

646
00:53:11,464 --> 00:53:14,352
Scott: If I just feel like, you know, you're looking like Twitch streamers.

647
00:53:14,393 --> 00:53:16,615
Scott: They always got to stream on a schedule, and they got to stream.

648
00:53:16,655 --> 00:53:17,119
Scott: No, you know what?

649
00:53:17,641 --> 00:53:20,291
Scott: If I feel like streaming right now, I'll just turn the stream randomly.

650
00:53:20,332 --> 00:53:21,119
Scott: I don't got to announce it.

651
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:22,160
Scott: I'm just going to, whenever.

652
00:53:22,601 --> 00:53:24,400
Scott: I feel like playing this game today.

653
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:27,148
Scott: You didn't get to see me finish streaming that game yet.

654
00:53:27,168 --> 00:53:29,230
Scott: I didn't feel like finishing streaming the rest of it.

655
00:53:29,532 --> 00:53:30,622
Scott: I'm playing a different game today.

656
00:53:30,663 --> 00:53:31,410
Scott: I'm going to stream that.

657
00:53:31,471 --> 00:53:32,420
Rym: Well, like that War Group thing.

658
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:36,640
Rym: I started streaming like every mission in War Group, and I was going to do a thing in episodes.

659
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:37,710
Rym: But I'm busy.

660
00:53:37,974 --> 00:53:38,300
Rym: Fuck that.

661
00:53:38,704 --> 00:53:39,899
Rym: If I play War Group, I'll stream it.

662
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:40,766
Scott: Right.

663
00:53:40,826 --> 00:53:41,291
Scott: You know what?

664
00:53:41,775 --> 00:53:43,412
Scott: I feel like making a video about this thing.

665
00:53:43,453 --> 00:53:44,120
Scott: I make that video.

666
00:53:44,421 --> 00:53:46,339
Scott: I never make another video like that ever again.

667
00:53:46,861 --> 00:53:47,189
Rym: Whatev.

668
00:53:47,395 --> 00:53:47,579
Rym: Yep.

669
00:53:48,102 --> 00:53:49,700
Scott: I'm going to post some photos.

670
00:53:50,903 --> 00:53:52,760
Rym: I took some photos, I'm going to post them.

671
00:53:52,821 --> 00:53:57,304
Rym: Not to say we're not going to plan, because one thing we are going to do is we're going to build, one thing we are going to build.

672
00:53:57,324 --> 00:53:58,153
Rym: This is specific.

673
00:53:58,174 --> 00:53:59,568
Scott: The point is I'm going for quantity.

674
00:53:59,649 --> 00:53:59,952
Scott: Yep.

675
00:54:00,113 --> 00:54:00,295
Scott: Right?

676
00:54:00,315 --> 00:54:02,659
Scott: Just make stuff and put out stuff.

677
00:54:03,362 --> 00:54:04,780
Rym: But, think back to early GeekNights.

678
00:54:05,601 --> 00:54:13,143
Rym: What we did spend a lot of time planning was the production pipeline to create a podcast like mechanically, regardless of what the content was.

679
00:54:13,163 --> 00:54:13,324
Rym: Right.

680
00:54:13,345 --> 00:54:19,262
Scott: I got to be, if I'm going to stream at random times or make videos at random times.

681
00:54:19,405 --> 00:54:21,613
Rym: I need to be able to sit down here and go "boop" and everything is just working.

682
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:27,653
Scott: We have to set up stuff so that I can just do those things as soon as I think to do those things.

683
00:54:27,836 --> 00:54:27,937
Scott: Yep.

684
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:29,873
Rym: Before that momentum is gone.

685
00:54:29,893 --> 00:54:29,994
Scott: Right.

686
00:54:30,035 --> 00:54:33,450
Scott: I can just set the thing up and do it right away with very little effort.

687
00:54:33,551 --> 00:54:35,086
Scott: Load it up, upload it and be done.

688
00:54:35,348 --> 00:54:35,812
Scott: One, two, three.

689
00:54:35,953 --> 00:54:39,751
Scott: As easy as you know, like if I'm sitting at home with nothing to do and I say "You know what?

690
00:54:39,771 --> 00:54:40,054
Scott: I got an

691
00:54:40,094 --> 00:54:40,336
Scott: idea.".

692
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:42,965
Scott: Just do it as easily as I do this GeekNights.

693
00:54:43,005 --> 00:54:43,248
Rym: Yep.

694
00:54:43,268 --> 00:55:00,620
Rym: So I'm not going to plan to do a particular video show, but what I am going to plan a lot is what is the hardware, software and setup to as quickly as possible, if Scott and I want to make a video together, how quickly can we just set up a standard kit that just works so we immediately start making the content.

695
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:00,841
Rym: Right.

696
00:55:00,861 --> 00:55:05,350
Scott: Make all kinds of things in all sorts of mediums and all sorts of platforms, right?

697
00:55:05,370 --> 00:55:05,531
Scott: Yep.

698
00:55:05,693 --> 00:55:10,077
Scott: I'm trying to use our social medias more, our Instagrams and Twitter or whatever.

699
00:55:10,097 --> 00:55:10,158
Scott: Yep.

700
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:14,060
Scott: We have Facebook, but I'm not going to put any work into the Facebook.

701
00:55:14,665 --> 00:55:15,414
Scott: It's an automatic thing.

702
00:55:15,434 --> 00:55:20,302
Rym: But to be clear, we are going to just keep doing GeekNights, like the show, because this costs us nothing.

703
00:55:20,322 --> 00:55:22,727
Scott: But also, you know, GeekNights format, right?

704
00:55:22,808 --> 00:55:27,153
Scott: It's like, we're not going to waterfall it and just be like "Okay, all new GeekNights format, but you know what?

705
00:55:27,517 --> 00:55:29,011
Scott: We'll just change things over time.

706
00:55:29,051 --> 00:55:30,403
Scott: If it works, we'll roll it back.

707
00:55:30,444 --> 00:55:31,997
Scott: If it doesn't work, we'll roll it, you know,

708
00:55:32,038 --> 00:55:32,300
Scott: whatever.".

709
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:43,353
Rym: One thing to our credit, I listened to those early episodes, once we locked the format down, I think our format, like the format of this for a podcast that is like buy Weet-Bolt twice a week, it's a really good format.

710
00:55:43,373 --> 00:55:46,666
Scott: Right, but we don't have to feel like there's some law, like we must stay in this structure.

711
00:55:46,686 --> 00:55:48,040
Scott: We can just do whatever we feel like doing.

712
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:59,960
Rym: Though, that's not to say that that is good advice for all of you, because the reason we are so good at this is because we set up this structure and we just fucking did it four nights a week for years and years and years.

713
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:01,170
Rym: Like, we forced ourselves.

714
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:04,849
Scott: Originally, we said at the very beginning of GeekNights, I was like "Look at those Penny Arcade

715
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:05,051
Scott: guys.".

716
00:56:05,071 --> 00:56:05,920
Rym: Yep, they just made a comic.

717
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:06,708
Rym: and how shitty it was.

718
00:56:06,728 --> 00:56:09,354
Scott: They make a three-panel comic and they make it three days a week no matter what.

719
00:56:09,394 --> 00:56:10,466
Scott: We have to do the same thing.

720
00:56:10,486 --> 00:56:11,478
Scott: And we didn't.

721
00:56:11,964 --> 00:56:13,158
Scott: we're not as consistent as them.

722
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:15,923
Scott: But we're consistent enough that it works.

723
00:56:16,065 --> 00:56:16,938
Rym: It really did work.

724
00:56:17,701 --> 00:56:23,660
Rym: And we need to build the pipeline to easily make video, build the pipeline to easily start streams.

725
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:27,539
Rym: But what we do with that is you're just going to have to see.

726
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:30,427
Rym: We got ideas, we're not going to shit talk them until we just do them.

727
00:56:30,487 --> 00:56:32,650
Scott: And also the things around GeekNights.

728
00:56:32,670 --> 00:56:35,219
Scott: So I don't know, for anyone who's listening, right, so we got.

729
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:36,812
Scott: Rym has a YouTube channel.

730
00:56:37,216 --> 00:56:38,407
Scott: I have a different YouTube channel.

731
00:56:38,427 --> 00:56:40,103
Scott: There is actually a GeekNights YouTube channel.

732
00:56:40,123 --> 00:56:40,688
Rym: We lost it.

733
00:56:40,991 --> 00:56:43,039
Scott: I think I can access it maybe.

734
00:56:44,043 --> 00:56:44,912
Scott: But I don't know if we need to.

735
00:56:44,932 --> 00:56:49,800
Rym: The tricky part is most of our followers of video are following my channel because that's where I put all the panels.

736
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:51,199
Scott: Right, but yeah, I also have channel.

737
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:54,428
Scott: You know, and it's not like I can upload to Rym's channel.

738
00:56:54,469 --> 00:56:54,692
Scott: Yup.

739
00:56:55,117 --> 00:56:55,320
Scott: Anyway.

740
00:56:56,424 --> 00:56:57,597
Scott: I have a Twitch channel.

741
00:56:57,637 --> 00:56:59,153
Scott: I don't remember the last time I used it.

742
00:56:59,395 --> 00:57:01,274
Rym: I'm not going to keep streaming on YouTube.

743
00:57:01,375 --> 00:57:05,880
Scott: Usually when I stream, I use like this restream thing that streams to Twitch and YouTube.

744
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:08,385
Scott: There's also, who knows, maybe I'll try the mixer thing.

745
00:57:08,446 --> 00:57:09,496
Scott: Maybe another site will appear.

746
00:57:09,516 --> 00:57:09,960
Scott: Who knows?

747
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:10,439
Scott: Whatever.

748
00:57:12,063 --> 00:57:18,120
Scott: Yeah, you got to follow us on Twitter or Instagram, which I guess are the social Instagram, technically Facebook, but whatever.

749
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:19,700
Rym: Yup, just follow us everywhere.

750
00:57:20,681 --> 00:57:22,284
Rym: And stay tuned for like basic stuff.

751
00:57:22,304 --> 00:57:23,314
Rym: We are going to restructure.

752
00:57:23,334 --> 00:57:25,860
Scott: Most of the time we tweet when a thing happens.

753
00:57:26,381 --> 00:57:28,566
Scott: Right, so every GeekNights episode gets tweeted.

754
00:57:28,586 --> 00:57:29,919
Scott: Every news post gets tweeted.

755
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,020
Scott: Every video we upload gets tweeted.

756
00:57:32,482 --> 00:57:34,468
Scott: That's the number one way to see what's going.

757
00:57:34,488 --> 00:57:37,200
Scott: I'm going to try to get GeekNights on Spotify.

758
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:40,127
Scott: It's on all the other podcasting places and the RSS feed.

759
00:57:40,147 --> 00:57:45,807
Rym: But again, the only reason we are not, like we're on iTunes and everything else, but the reason we're not on a few platforms is because we're too old.

760
00:57:45,828 --> 00:57:49,705
Scott: Our shit is so old school with RSS that new shit doesn't work.

761
00:57:50,129 --> 00:57:52,472
Rym: And because we're busy, I'm trying to fix it.

762
00:57:52,573 --> 00:57:56,089
Rym: We do need to make a lot of changes to the web pipeline.

763
00:57:56,110 --> 00:57:58,273
Scott: We're going to, right, we're going to redo the website.

764
00:57:58,555 --> 00:58:02,130
Scott: We have a new, we had a great graphic designer come and help us.

765
00:58:02,372 --> 00:58:08,089
Rym: Many of you have seen, like, if you've seen us at a con, or like you've seen, like, bit by bit our logos are all updating in places.

766
00:58:08,130 --> 00:58:09,504
Scott: Right, we're doing slow changes.

767
00:58:09,525 --> 00:58:11,724
Scott: We're not just dumping this huge rebrand, right?

768
00:58:11,805 --> 00:58:14,613
Scott: We redid all our business cards and our flyers.

769
00:58:14,633 --> 00:58:15,260
Scott: We got a new logo.

770
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:17,380
Scott: We updated the avatars and the social media side.

771
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:18,959
Scott: We're still doing more of that.

772
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:20,171
Rym: But see this philosophy.

773
00:58:20,191 --> 00:58:24,536
Rym: Old Rym and Skaad would have not updated anything until everything was ready.

774
00:58:24,637 --> 00:58:24,860
Scott: Exactly.

775
00:58:25,341 --> 00:58:28,493
Scott: But now, yep, our YouTube channel Whatever, we're not making money on this.

776
00:58:28,574 --> 00:58:30,331
Scott: Let's just roll it out as we can.

777
00:58:30,452 --> 00:58:32,188
Rym: We are making money, but not that much money.

778
00:58:32,471 --> 00:58:34,511
Scott: Oh, you're taking all that money.

779
00:58:34,632 --> 00:58:35,744
Rym: Yeah, but I'm also paying for the Libsyn.

780
00:58:35,805 --> 00:58:38,734
Scott: I'm still not in favor of Patreon for GeekNights.

781
00:58:38,815 --> 00:58:40,048
Rym: Well, I'm going to start putting.

782
00:58:40,068 --> 00:58:43,039
Scott: Patreon is for people who, you know, need the money, like starving artist people.

783
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:43,745
Scott: Ah, but.

784
00:58:43,887 --> 00:58:45,120
Scott: It's not for people who got the money.

785
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:49,665
Rym: I am putting, that money is going to be used to do, like, I paid for all the graphic design stuff with that.

786
00:58:49,847 --> 00:58:50,191
Rym: Sure.

787
00:58:50,718 --> 00:58:50,839
Scott: And.

788
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:52,655
Scott: But you could have afforded to pay for it yourself.

789
00:58:52,978 --> 00:58:53,120
Scott: Yeah.

790
00:58:53,401 --> 00:58:54,370
Scott: So you didn't need that money.

791
00:58:54,572 --> 00:58:56,389
Scott: But I do Stop giving him money.

792
00:58:56,612 --> 00:58:57,925
Rym: I do have a goal in the end.

793
00:58:58,006 --> 00:58:58,693
Rym: I would like to.

794
00:58:58,713 --> 00:59:01,599
Scott: If you hadn't given it to him, he would have paid for the graphic design with his own money.

795
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:02,124
Rym: Maybe.

796
00:59:02,448 --> 00:59:02,610
Rym: Yeah.

797
00:59:02,691 --> 00:59:03,891
Rym: I would have made you pay for half of it.

798
00:59:04,075 --> 00:59:04,320
Scott: Maybe.

799
00:59:05,301 --> 00:59:06,200
Scott: I have money.

800
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:13,540
Rym: But the thing is, we're going to start paying for those kinds of things more often to accelerate ourselves.

801
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:15,803
Scott: Yeah, we paid the graphic designer a lot of money by the way.

802
00:59:15,824 --> 00:59:28,672
Rym: Because another problem we have, like, this is getting back to past and present, is that because we literally made everything ourselves in the beginning, except like we paid some artists for a few things, but like, we made our whole website ourselves.

803
00:59:28,712 --> 00:59:29,742
Rym: We made like everything.

804
00:59:29,762 --> 00:59:31,965
Scott: I'm probably still going to end up making the website myself.

805
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:32,510
Rym: Yeah, but.

806
00:59:32,531 --> 00:59:33,500
Scott: At least the backend.

807
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:36,611
Rym: When it makes sense, we're going to hire people to help us, because.

808
00:59:36,632 --> 00:59:38,650
Scott: If you want to help us, let us know.

809
00:59:38,751 --> 00:59:42,673
Rym: But we personally cannot be good at everything.

810
00:59:42,713 --> 00:59:48,188
Rym: we need to be good at to make some of the content we want to make while still having full-time jobs.

811
00:59:48,208 --> 00:59:48,955
Rym: Like, I'm a pretty good videographer.

812
00:59:48,976 --> 00:59:59,964
Scott: I really want to pay someone to transcribe all our stuff and I've found people who will do it, but the problem is just the total amount of money, because we have so many episodes, they will never be able to do all of it.

813
00:59:59,984 --> 01:00:00,953
Rym: Oh, here's a harder problem.

814
01:00:01,417 --> 01:00:05,220
Rym: I would love to just pay camera people to video all our shit for us at conventions.

815
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:16,186
Rym: The problem is, most conventions, if anyone touches the camera that's recording us while we're on stage, the union's going to fuck us over and we, even with Patreon money, we can't afford to pay off the union.

816
01:00:16,672 --> 01:00:24,440
Rym: We'd have to literally, like at PAX Unplugged, we'd literally have to pay, like, two people of wage to stand next to our camera.

817
01:00:25,641 --> 01:00:27,520
Rym: So, some things we can't actually fix yet.

818
01:00:28,022 --> 01:00:28,203
Rym: Right.

819
01:00:28,365 --> 01:00:32,691
Scott: I brought back, recently, the GeekNights newsletter, which you may not know exists.

820
01:00:32,752 --> 01:00:33,035
Scott: Yup.

821
01:00:33,237 --> 01:00:36,146
Scott: Right, because someone reminded me the website Tiny Letter exists and I'm like, "Oh,

822
01:00:36,166 --> 01:00:36,389
Scott: yeah!".

823
01:00:36,712 --> 01:00:36,975
Rym: Yeah.

824
01:00:36,995 --> 01:00:38,652
Scott: That's what I use for the GeekNights newsletter.

825
01:00:38,813 --> 01:00:40,775
Rym: I'm bringing back Rym's Rants for once a week.

826
01:00:40,877 --> 01:00:44,930
Rym: I just, whatever's on my mind just goes to the Patreon, which is there.

827
01:00:44,951 --> 01:00:45,400
Scott: Right.

828
01:00:45,721 --> 01:00:47,740
Rym: I'm going to talk about this next to the following.

829
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:51,216
Scott: I don't know what Rym's is saying in Rym's Rants, because I don't pay him to see the Patreon.

830
01:00:51,237 --> 01:00:51,762
Rym: People like him.

831
01:00:52,125 --> 01:00:54,428
Scott: But, yeah, you should not listen to anything he says.

832
01:00:54,448 --> 01:00:56,329
Scott: Whatever he says is wrong.

833
01:00:56,490 --> 01:00:57,360
Scott: He's lying.

834
01:00:58,122 --> 01:00:58,830
Scott: I don't know what it is.

835
01:00:59,174 --> 01:00:59,538
Scott: It's wrong.

836
01:01:02,042 --> 01:01:05,821
Rym: Watch, you like sneak in, like someone gives you a dollar and it's just like, "Man, Scott's so

837
01:01:05,862 --> 01:01:06,104
Rym: good.".

838
01:01:06,165 --> 01:01:16,751
Scott: Yeah, if people are listening to this as an MP3, I don't know if you know, but we just stream every, as we're recording every episode of GeekNights, we stream it on YouTube so you can watch it live whenever that happens to me.

839
01:01:16,912 --> 01:01:17,174
Rym: Yup.

840
01:01:17,295 --> 01:01:21,274
Rym: There's ten people watching this live right now and these things get a few hundred views.

841
01:01:21,396 --> 01:01:22,507
Scott: I don't know why they're watching.

842
01:01:22,527 --> 01:01:24,771
Scott: I gotta have something better to do, but okay, there they are.

843
01:01:25,054 --> 01:01:29,821
Rym: One thing you get, the self-deprecating joke can only take you so far, because you just said, "We're going to try

844
01:01:29,842 --> 01:01:29,922
Rym: hard.".

845
01:01:30,003 --> 01:01:31,033
Scott: It's not a joke, though.

846
01:01:31,235 --> 01:01:35,035
Rym: We're going to try hard, but don't ever look at anything we try hard on.

847
01:01:35,055 --> 01:01:35,460
Rym: That's right.

848
01:01:36,342 --> 01:01:38,528
Scott: It's about me enjoying making stuff.

849
01:01:38,568 --> 01:01:41,437
Scott: It's not saying that you should be paying attention to it.

850
01:01:41,457 --> 01:01:42,673
Rym: You're just being sad-piro.

851
01:01:43,018 --> 01:01:43,119
Rym: No.

852
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,639
Rym: Just drawing sad girls in snow.

853
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:47,439
Rym: Telling people not to look at them.

854
01:01:48,222 --> 01:01:48,446
Scott: So, yeah.

855
01:01:50,523 --> 01:01:53,479
Scott: Come and see whatever we make, but actually don't.

856
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:53,902
Rym: Yup.

857
01:01:54,690 --> 01:01:55,579
Rym: I'll put it this way.

858
01:01:56,745 --> 01:02:02,772
Rym: The show you're watching or listening to right now is going to keep going as it's going, but a lot of other stuff is just going to appear.

859
01:02:03,237 --> 01:02:04,208
Rym: Some of them might succeed.

860
01:02:04,248 --> 01:02:05,119
Rym: Some of them might fail.

861
01:02:06,503 --> 01:02:13,923
Rym: I'm investing in the technology and hardware to ease the production pipeline on the kinds of new content we're going to do.

862
01:02:13,943 --> 01:02:25,380
Rym: I think I'm finally going to give up on using a giant physical mixer board because we do not need that because the kinds of things I need that mixer board for are things we're not doing anymore.

863
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:29,139
Rym: That mixer is going to get busted out when we run a convention someday.

864
01:02:30,145 --> 01:02:31,923
Rym: And I need that mixer board to be in the live room.

865
01:02:33,297 --> 01:02:34,679
Rym: Part of that is because technology got better.

866
01:02:35,482 --> 01:02:36,311
Rym: Cameras are cheaper.

867
01:02:36,371 --> 01:02:37,180
Rym: Equipment's cheaper.

868
01:02:38,422 --> 01:02:41,944
Rym: USB-C, like modern audio input devices, are good now.

869
01:02:41,964 --> 01:02:44,758
Rym: They weren't that good a couple of years ago.

870
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:48,310
Scott: So the last thing is the gig nights community.

871
01:02:48,330 --> 01:02:55,684
Scott: I don't know if people realize, so when we started gig nights, it's like, whoa, obviously we should have a community.

872
01:02:55,704 --> 01:02:59,060
Scott: Every thing had a community.

873
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:04,936
Scott: It's usually its own web forum or news group or newsletter where people could reply or something like that.

874
01:03:04,997 --> 01:03:07,320
Scott: In those days, that was the only way to have a community.

875
01:03:08,364 --> 01:03:15,362
Scott: If you were listening to a thing and you wanted to get together with other people who were following that thing, you would go to a forum for the thing.

876
01:03:15,887 --> 01:03:17,726
Scott: So we had this forum and the forum has.

877
01:03:18,190 --> 01:03:22,354
Scott: it's been archived and it still exists and there's still people there and a community is formed.

878
01:03:22,374 --> 01:03:25,120
Rym: There's a terrifying amount of content in this old forum.

879
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:26,310
Rym: Right.

880
01:03:26,350 --> 01:03:29,765
Scott: But yeah, the forum's been going since 2005.

881
01:03:29,765 --> 01:03:30,635
Scott: And people have come.

882
01:03:30,656 --> 01:03:31,363
Scott: People have gone.

883
01:03:31,404 --> 01:03:32,373
Scott: We've met people.

884
01:03:32,494 --> 01:03:36,171
Scott: We've lost people, whatever things dramatically.

885
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:38,090
Scott: It's like a whole thing of its own.

886
01:03:38,332 --> 01:03:40,314
Rym: We moved to new forum software.

887
01:03:40,335 --> 01:03:40,780
Rym: Right.

888
01:03:41,021 --> 01:03:43,180
Scott: It's like a whole separate thing from the show.

889
01:03:43,341 --> 01:03:45,259
Scott: A lot of people in there don't even listen to the show.

890
01:03:46,062 --> 01:03:47,746
Scott: There's a lot of people lurking in there.

891
01:03:47,827 --> 01:03:49,080
Rym: Yeah, most people lurk.

892
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:52,817
Rym: Holy shit, a lot of people read the forum with accounts but never post.

893
01:03:52,837 --> 01:03:54,573
Scott: Well, it's also completely public to the internet.

894
01:03:54,613 --> 01:03:57,382
Scott: It's not something where only registered people get in.

895
01:03:57,443 --> 01:04:00,677
Rym: But a lot of people have accounts but never post.

896
01:04:00,718 --> 01:04:03,746
Rym: But I can see in the logs, they come every day and read it for credit.

897
01:04:03,766 --> 01:04:06,779
Scott: If you want to register, make sure when you register for it, it's totally free.

898
01:04:07,264 --> 01:04:08,154
Scott: You just have to type.

899
01:04:08,174 --> 01:04:11,060
Scott: There's gonna be a box, like a reason for joining the forum.

900
01:04:11,603 --> 01:04:13,323
Scott: You have to type something in there.

901
01:04:13,546 --> 01:04:21,527
Scott: that makes me click the approve button because I think, ah yes, this is a real person who knows who we are and not some bot trying to make an account to spam.

902
01:04:21,587 --> 01:04:26,761
Rym: Scott, are we saying that they can look forward to the listener more tech news roundup in 2020?

903
01:04:26,761 --> 01:04:28,298
Scott: No, you can't.

904
01:04:29,270 --> 01:04:29,779
Scott: Maybe less.

905
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:34,296
Scott: But anyway, that was the extent of our community.

906
01:04:34,316 --> 01:04:36,293
Scott: And I think it's been 15 years.

907
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:44,299
Scott: I think now, if you are the person who makes content, your community exists not in a forum that you make.

908
01:04:45,082 --> 01:04:46,780
Scott: It exists in social media.

909
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:47,955
Scott: People tweet at you.

910
01:04:48,056 --> 01:04:49,147
Scott: People reply.

911
01:04:49,168 --> 01:04:50,722
Scott: People comment on your Instagram posts.

912
01:04:50,742 --> 01:04:51,780
Rym: I'm telling you something crazy.

913
01:04:52,585 --> 01:04:55,448
Scott: People in your YouTube comments, that's where your community exists.

914
01:04:55,529 --> 01:04:59,700
Rym: Our YouTube comments, like on my channel, that is an amazing fucking community.

915
01:05:00,903 --> 01:05:03,144
Rym: Go look at the comments on our YouTube videos.

916
01:05:03,164 --> 01:05:04,340
Scott: Those people aren't in the forum.

917
01:05:04,882 --> 01:05:06,497
Rym: They don't even know the forum exists.

918
01:05:06,537 --> 01:05:08,239
Rym: Half of them don't even know the podcast exists.

919
01:05:11,004 --> 01:05:16,980
Scott: If you're a new content thing, you know, today, not from 2005, that's where you have your community.

920
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:23,040
Scott: So, the forum itself has sort of lagged because people don't need it, you know, various reasons.

921
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:24,897
Rym: Yeah, but here's a specific technical reason.

922
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:33,889
Rym: Over time, our website eventually broke in a way to where the episodes on the website don't actually link to their forum threads.

923
01:05:33,909 --> 01:05:35,040
Scott: I don't think that's such a big deal.

924
01:05:36,104 --> 01:05:37,280
Rym: It's one of the funnels.

925
01:05:37,580 --> 01:05:38,111
Scott: It's a deal.

926
01:05:38,131 --> 01:05:38,600
Rym: We lost a funnel.

927
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:39,485
Scott: The point is...

928
01:05:39,505 --> 01:05:41,100
Rym: Also, most people don't even know we have a website.

929
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:43,995
Scott: Right, people don't use the website or forums or anything, right?

930
01:05:44,036 --> 01:05:57,360
Scott: So, community-wise, I think we have to, you know, get with the times and update and now engage more with our community and YouTube comments, you know, social media posts, right?

931
01:05:57,660 --> 01:06:03,887
Scott: The newsletter, if you reply to the newsletter via email, I see that.

932
01:06:03,928 --> 01:06:05,059
Scott: That's how a tiny letter works.

933
01:06:05,603 --> 01:06:10,160
Scott: And so, like, that's how you can give feedback on that and then I can address it in the next newsletter.

934
01:06:11,303 --> 01:06:12,231
Scott: But yeah, reply.

935
01:06:12,271 --> 01:06:12,796
Scott: Don't worry.

936
01:06:12,836 --> 01:06:14,392
Scott: You can come to the forum if you want.

937
01:06:14,432 --> 01:06:15,159
Scott: It's going to exist.

938
01:06:15,502 --> 01:06:16,715
Scott: We're going to make changes to it.

939
01:06:16,755 --> 01:06:18,049
Scott: We don't know what those changes will be.

940
01:06:18,150 --> 01:06:20,432
Scott: Other than that, they will be slow and numerous.

941
01:06:20,614 --> 01:06:25,000
Rym: Yeah, we got a good idea of the strategy, but execution is going to take us a while.

942
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:26,898
Scott: We're going to move the forum in different directions.

943
01:06:26,938 --> 01:06:29,380
Scott: If you're in the forum and you don't like those directions, I'm sorry.

944
01:06:30,367 --> 01:06:41,585
Rym: Not going to lie, tough shit, because a fundamental thing I see is that the GeekNights community, like the people who are just fans of this, are not like, the people in the forum generally don't listen to the show.

945
01:06:41,847 --> 01:06:42,009
Rym: No.

946
01:06:42,433 --> 01:06:52,980
Rym: But the people who listen to the show are not in the forum and the people in the forum are increasingly just using it as a place to hang out, which is not really what we wanted ever.

947
01:06:54,370 --> 01:06:54,573
Scott: Yeah.

948
01:06:54,634 --> 01:06:57,644
Scott: We do have a subreddit that I'm the moderator of.

949
01:06:57,704 --> 01:06:59,060
Scott: that is rarely posted in.

950
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,353
Rym: I think we're going to start using that more.

951
01:07:00,576 --> 01:07:00,879
Scott: I don't know.

952
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:01,423
Scott: Maybe.

953
01:07:01,665 --> 01:07:02,150
Scott: We'll see.

954
01:07:02,210 --> 01:07:05,100
Scott: But it's posted in more than zero, but it's extremely rare.

955
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,356
Rym: There's a GeekNights Discord.

956
01:07:06,376 --> 01:07:08,579
Rym: that's like, people are in there hanging out.

957
01:07:09,223 --> 01:07:09,707
Rym: I'm in there.

958
01:07:09,788 --> 01:07:10,960
Rym: I mostly lurk, but I'm in there.

959
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:13,120
Scott: Yeah, there is an official GeekNights Discord.

960
01:07:14,711 --> 01:07:18,896
Scott: It's actually adminned by a trusted listener because we didn't create it.

961
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:20,109
Scott: But, yeah.

962
01:07:20,211 --> 01:07:20,580
Scott: It's there.

963
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:26,090
Scott: We have knighted it as the official, you know, public GeekNights Discord.

964
01:07:26,393 --> 01:07:29,322
Scott: You can find it and get in there and see what's up.

965
01:07:29,463 --> 01:07:33,344
Scott: We'll see what happens with that if more people go there or not.

966
01:07:33,485 --> 01:07:34,760
Scott: It has not much activity.

967
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:35,202
Rym: Yup.

968
01:07:36,233 --> 01:07:36,556
Scott: So.

969
01:07:36,597 --> 01:07:36,880
Scott: But, yeah.

970
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:38,125
Rym: So, yeah.

971
01:07:38,328 --> 01:07:44,377
Rym: GeekNights is gonna steamroll on, but everything around GeekNights, other than the show itself, is going to evolve.

972
01:07:45,321 --> 01:07:46,574
Scott: The show will also evolve.

973
01:07:46,695 --> 01:07:50,235
Rym: Yeah, but the show will evolve less, I think, because the format's so easy.

974
01:07:50,437 --> 01:07:50,780
Scott: We'll see.

975
01:07:50,982 --> 01:07:52,619
Rym: It's so easy to make this.

976
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:54,097
Scott: We'll try a thing now and then.

977
01:07:55,100 --> 01:07:56,032
Rym: Can we do the lounge?

978
01:07:56,437 --> 01:07:56,559
Scott: No.

979
01:07:57,340 --> 01:07:57,813
Scott: That's a thing.

980
01:07:57,854 --> 01:07:59,629
Scott: we'll undo the lounge.

981
01:08:00,254 --> 01:08:02,440
Scott: In fact, I hereby cancel the lounge.

982
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:04,456
Rym: I'm gonna call this episode the lounge.

983
01:08:04,476 --> 01:08:05,791
Scott: The lounge is hereby cancelled.

984
01:08:05,832 --> 01:08:06,439
Rym: No more lounge.

985
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:07,447
Rym: Hereby uncancelled.

986
01:08:07,629 --> 01:08:07,831
Rym: No.

987
01:08:08,174 --> 01:08:08,780
Scott: Here's the problem.

988
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:09,606
Scott: Lounge over.

989
01:08:09,626 --> 01:08:10,233
Scott: Rip rip lounge.

990
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:15,752
Rym: The problem with GeekNights is that we have equal say and there's no way to break a tie.

991
01:08:15,934 --> 01:08:16,319
Scott: Rip lounge.

992
01:08:17,804 --> 01:08:18,434
Rym: Lounge forever.

993
01:08:18,495 --> 01:08:19,367
Rym: Long live the lounge.

994
01:08:19,993 --> 01:08:21,890
Scott: The triple L. Here's the lounge's grave.

995
01:08:21,971 --> 01:08:23,112
Scott: Watch me rub my butt on it.

996
01:08:25,443 --> 01:08:27,349
Rym: Yeah, so keep an eye on us.

997
01:08:27,634 --> 01:08:27,880
Scott: Okay.

998
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:32,640
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

999
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:37,974
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1000
01:08:38,176 --> 01:08:43,225
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1001
01:08:43,448 --> 01:08:46,135
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1002
01:08:46,276 --> 01:08:50,839
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1003
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:55,245
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1004
01:08:55,649 --> 01:08:58,700
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1005
01:08:58,939 --> 01:09:01,800
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1006
01:09:07,831 --> 01:09:08,741
Rym: I know it's been a while.

1007
01:09:08,822 --> 01:09:12,438
Rym: This was one of the worst hiatus we've had in a long time, but we are back.

1008
01:09:12,457 --> 01:09:13,004
Rym: We are back.

1009
01:09:13,064 --> 01:09:15,004
Rym: As you saw, there's gonna be a lot of new content.

1010
01:09:15,044 --> 01:09:17,249
Rym: Stay tuned for all this fun stuff we're working on.

1011
01:09:17,872 --> 01:09:18,901
Rym: Maybe a zine.

1012
01:09:18,942 --> 01:09:21,149
Rym: I'll shit talk a little bit because Scott never listens to this part.

1013
01:09:21,553 --> 01:09:22,866
Rym: We're looking at doing a zine at cons.

1014
01:09:22,886 --> 01:09:34,341
Rym: We're looking at doing a lot of really focused board game videos, not just on how to learn games, but also live streams of us playing games, talks on how to be good at specific games, all that kind of nonsense.

1015
01:09:34,848 --> 01:09:36,049
Rym: But stay tuned.

1016
01:09:37,712 --> 01:10:08,989

1017
01:10:09,450 --> 01:10:11,997
Rym: Those are the joyful screams of people on a roller coaster.

1018
01:10:12,482 --> 01:10:15,229
Rym: Human screams are my favorite of the Earth's delights.

1019

1020
01:10:18,156 --> 01:10:19,750
