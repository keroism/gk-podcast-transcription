16
00:01:06,201 --> 00:01:09,454
Scott: Oh Mets in the second last game of the season Were they okay seats though?

17
00:01:09,935 --> 00:01:11,400
Rym: No, you're in like the back corner.

18
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:21,430
Scott: No, this is like get into the secret club seats cuz that's It's the isn't not so secret club, but it's like there's an area with like couches and stuff.

19
00:01:21,611 --> 00:01:25,628
Rym: I was about to say I would not pay $40 to sit like on the upper upper deck.

20
00:01:25,989 --> 00:01:29,424
Scott: Yeah I think it's actually more like $2.

21
00:01:29,424 --> 00:01:29,826
Scott: sit up there.

22
00:01:30,852 --> 00:01:32,904
Scott: So back in August I buy these tickets and we're looking.

23
00:01:32,924 --> 00:01:33,810
Scott: we're like when should we go?

24
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:35,215
Scott: How about the second last?

25
00:01:35,276 --> 00:01:36,925
Scott: I was like, well the last game of the season.

26
00:01:36,945 --> 00:01:37,850
Scott: That's a novelty, right?

27
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:43,630
Scott: There'll be all sorts of like seasons over stuff, you know, it's like a you know thing, right?

28
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:44,813
Scott: And I'm like, wait a minute.

29
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:54,246
Scott: if you go on the last day of the season, which was Sunday yesterday because we stink We're not the playoffs You get a fridge magnet calendar of the 2019 schedule.

30
00:01:55,351 --> 00:02:00,855
Scott: They figure out the schedule, I guess a more than a year in advance Which other sports don't do.

31
00:02:01,377 --> 00:02:03,344
Scott: but I was like, wait a minute.

32
00:02:03,364 --> 00:02:07,522
Scott: if we go one day before that It's a night game and there's fireworks.

33
00:02:08,085 --> 00:02:08,970
Scott: Let's do that instead.

34
00:02:09,551 --> 00:02:17,457
Scott: So we had game tickets for the Saturday night, right and then like a few weeks ago It's like this announcement, right?

35
00:02:17,518 --> 00:02:20,369
Scott: It's like Oh David Wright who you probably don't know who that is.

36
00:02:20,691 --> 00:02:21,053
Rym: No, I'm not.

37
00:02:21,073 --> 00:02:23,207
Rym: I've never really been a Mets fan until I moved here.

38
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:23,690
Rym: It's amazing.

39
00:02:25,832 --> 00:02:29,847
Scott: So David Wright is this guy who played third base for the Mets for a long ass time, right?

40
00:02:31,232 --> 00:02:39,042
Scott: I don't think he played for anyone else and he because he played for the Mets for so long Even though they never won even though occasionally did good and he was.

41
00:02:39,062 --> 00:02:41,370
Scott: he wasn't like this incredibly good player.

42
00:02:41,651 --> 00:02:48,318
Scott: he was well above average, but not like legendarily good, but Played for the Mets for so long.

43
00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:55,610
Scott: He's got like all these Mets like batting record The most hits of any met, you know the right and all this thrice.

44
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,278
Scott: He's like one of the best players.

45
00:02:57,318 --> 00:02:59,830
Scott: the Mets have ever had most strikeouts as a man.

46
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:02,995
Scott: All these right, he's like.

47
00:03:03,035 --> 00:03:10,668
Scott: he's like the captain of the Mets but for the past like two years or so He's been basically so injured that he's unable to play.

48
00:03:12,632 --> 00:03:13,355
Scott: So he's just been.

49
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:13,717
Scott: he's still.

50
00:03:13,898 --> 00:03:15,706
Scott: he's still mad but he's wasn't on the team.

51
00:03:15,766 --> 00:03:16,630
Scott: he was elsewhere.

52
00:03:17,452 --> 00:03:17,933
Scott: This year.

53
00:03:17,973 --> 00:03:26,159
Scott: he was clawing his way back up like in the minors after sort of recovering kinda but they announced like oh, yeah All right, his career is over.

54
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:32,321
Scott: He's gonna retire, but he's gonna come back For like a week, but he's only gonna start in one game.

55
00:03:33,123 --> 00:03:37,520
Scott: and lo and behold that happened to be the game That we already had tickets to.

56
00:03:37,882 --> 00:03:38,807
Scott: we do one game.

57
00:03:38,827 --> 00:03:41,856
Scott: We bought tickets With the fireworks.

58
00:03:42,217 --> 00:03:44,626
Scott: the second last guy didn't make it the last game in the season.

59
00:03:44,907 --> 00:03:47,118
Scott: second the last game I don't know.

60
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,209
Scott: That's the day he chose.

61
00:03:48,692 --> 00:04:02,522
Scott: So, of course what we thought was gonna be like an empty ballpark Chillin eating the hot dog was crazy crowded with all sorts of ridiculous ceremonies All kinds of nonsense all kinds of people.

62
00:04:02,602 --> 00:04:04,769
Scott: I could have sold the tickets actually made a bunch of money.

63
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:09,544
Scott: But you know, I wanted to see some fireworks eat a hot dog.

64
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:09,785
Rym: Yeah.

65
00:04:09,826 --> 00:04:19,990
Scott: Yeah, that was your utility right, so Meanwhile we go in this game and I'm like, oh, you know the night market which is just outside at the Science Center?

66
00:04:20,272 --> 00:04:20,938
Rym: Oh, yeah, I never go to.

67
00:04:20,978 --> 00:04:22,290
Scott: that nightmare ends at midnight.

68
00:04:22,712 --> 00:04:25,944
Scott: I'm like and it just started again because it closes during the US Open.

69
00:04:25,964 --> 00:04:27,069
Scott: they can't have it then right.

70
00:04:27,089 --> 00:04:29,814
Scott: and I'm like, ooh, this game is gonna end.

71
00:04:30,275 --> 00:04:30,797
Scott: We're gonna go.

72
00:04:30,957 --> 00:04:34,827
Scott: there was zero zero until the game went to like the 13th inning.

73
00:04:38,432 --> 00:04:42,350
Scott: And I'm like at what point I've never been in a game with that many innings.

74
00:04:42,451 --> 00:04:44,390
Scott: I've been to a doubleheader, but that was nine and nine.

75
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:48,110
Rym: I mean I was at a hockey game that had two OTS that I've been to 10th inning.

76
00:04:48,393 --> 00:04:49,868
Scott: I may have been to 11th inning.

77
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:53,784
Scott: I've never been to 13th inning and it's late at night and I want to see this fucking.

78
00:04:54,145 --> 00:04:56,749
Scott: normally I could just gone home But there's fucking fireworks.

79
00:04:58,014 --> 00:04:58,990
Scott: Then I paid to see.

80
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,275
Scott: So I'm like waiting.

81
00:05:01,295 --> 00:05:02,581
Scott: I'm like at what point is it?

82
00:05:02,621 --> 00:05:04,510
Scott: Like, okay, this game is a too long.

83
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:05,814
Scott: I like it a game to end.

84
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:09,588
Scott: I'm gonna go home early, but at one point is it like well, it's the 18th inning.

85
00:05:10,171 --> 00:05:10,987
Scott: This is legendary.

86
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,369
Scott: I'm just gonna stay here and maybe the Sun will come up.

87
00:05:14,611 --> 00:05:21,737
Rym: I feel like there's a there's a. there's a graph you can make of how excited you are about overtime and it starts to drop Off for a while eventually.

88
00:05:21,818 --> 00:05:22,480
Scott: I don't like.

89
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,930
Scott: I don't like a shootout in hockey which starts this week, by the way.

90
00:05:25,112 --> 00:05:31,146
Scott: Yeah, pug night but You know, I appreciate the game ends.

91
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:36,810
Rym: I can go home Like when we went to that first packs and we're at the concerts and we're like super excited.

92
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,796
Rym: They're gonna go till 2 a.m It's gonna be crazy.

93
00:05:38,837 --> 00:05:40,000
Rym: And then 1 a.m.

94
00:05:40,061 --> 00:05:41,365
Rym: Rolls around and we're fading.

95
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:41,866
Scott: Yep.

96
00:05:42,549 --> 00:05:53,367
Scott: But anyway What was even worse is not only did I wait for all those innings then the fireworks come and I'm like, okay I expect there to be like a real fireworks show like the ones I'm used to right.

97
00:05:54,211 --> 00:05:55,702
Scott: It's like paid for by Verizon.

98
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:56,910
Scott: They got money, right?

99
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:00,645
Scott: I figured they're gonna shoot fireworks off behind the stadium and we're gonna you know, boom boom, right?

100
00:06:00,665 --> 00:06:03,015
Scott: No, no, no No, that's not what happened.

101
00:06:03,617 --> 00:06:08,916
Scott: So they come there's a bunch of people open a hole And out onto the field.

102
00:06:08,957 --> 00:06:21,535
Scott: they wheel out like these these like little like boards On wheels and there's like maybe seven of them and they arrange them in a circle with one in the middle and I can see You know like a more Fireworks.

103
00:06:21,616 --> 00:06:24,853
Scott: mortar is like a bowling ball Ball candle.

104
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,077
Scott: they're big.

105
00:06:26,097 --> 00:06:28,544
Scott: They're you know, at least bocce ball size, right?

106
00:06:28,564 --> 00:06:29,267
Scott: They're not small.

107
00:06:29,287 --> 00:06:31,555
Scott: I Look at these platforms.

108
00:06:31,595 --> 00:06:33,503
Scott: They got there's not a lot on them.

109
00:06:33,764 --> 00:06:40,154
Scott: Like they don't look like there's any You know actual like large mortar launcher Devices on there.

110
00:06:40,194 --> 00:06:44,430
Scott: They look more like the pyrotechnics you see on like a stage situation.

111
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:46,515
Rym: Was that just the mortar tubes?

112
00:06:46,555 --> 00:06:47,700
Rym: They were very far away.

113
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,287
Scott: No, they're not that far away.

114
00:06:49,307 --> 00:06:49,990
Scott: We were pretty close.

115
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:55,876
Scott: Yeah, great seats because we bought the ticket so early to a stinky team Before the game became a big deal.

116
00:06:56,398 --> 00:06:59,429
Scott: No, none of the fireworks for the kind that go up and then go.

117
00:06:59,489 --> 00:07:03,786
Scott: boom It was basically all Roman candle like but that I would argue that is not fireworks.

118
00:07:03,806 --> 00:07:06,314
Scott: I would say it just went And then they all disappeared.

119
00:07:06,334 --> 00:07:09,606
Scott: Yeah, there was no boom not one boom.

120
00:07:10,028 --> 00:07:16,830
Scott: and the whole thing It was only pyrotechnics that went up and also laser light show and they also had them on the ring.

121
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,499
Scott: Yeah, laser light shows roof of the stadium around the edge.

122
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,746
Rym: laser light shows were cool up until about 1985, right?

123
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:28,620
Scott: So it was uh, and it was it was like a. it was like a sing-along firework where they played many musics.

124
00:07:29,813 --> 00:07:31,270
Rym: That is not my kind of firework.

125
00:07:31,671 --> 00:07:42,260
Scott: And then the other thing that bothered me a lot is like all throughout the game and including the The fireworks show, you know, they couldn't for some reason They just couldn't play a song.

126
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:48,605
Scott: like every song Had to be like they had to switch the song so quickly and they would combine songs.

127
00:07:48,685 --> 00:07:50,070
Scott: and it's like they couldn't just play a song.

128
00:07:52,317 --> 00:07:58,573
Scott: It was it was you know You know, yeah, I don't know like, you know, there's the you know CNC music factory.

129
00:07:58,614 --> 00:07:59,537
Scott: everybody dance now.

130
00:07:59,998 --> 00:08:07,310
Scott: and then there's that other song that every stadium in the world uses since for the past However many years with the everybody clap your hands, right?

131
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,994
Scott: Right exactly even Rym knows it right?

132
00:08:10,314 --> 00:08:10,996
Scott: They couldn't do that.

133
00:08:11,056 --> 00:08:11,577
Scott: They had to go.

134
00:08:12,017 --> 00:08:13,440
Scott: everybody clap your head.

135
00:08:14,951 --> 00:08:17,416
Rym: That almost that reeks of someone trying too hard.

136
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:19,660
Scott: They were definitely trying too hard the whole time.

137
00:08:20,535 --> 00:08:20,969
Scott: They were not.

138
00:08:21,652 --> 00:08:25,285
Rym: It's like the version when you're driving who's messing with the radio and they change.

139
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:31,530
Rym: they listen to a song for like a minute And then they change to another song and anytime they played a song They did not play a single song on its own.

140
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:35,850
Scott: It was always a portion of a song cut to at least one other portion of another song.

141
00:08:36,352 --> 00:08:39,488
Rym: I wonder if they didn't actually have all their rights set up for the music.

142
00:08:40,831 --> 00:08:46,668
Scott: Also, all the music there is you know, non analog not like when you go to the garden ism the organist.

143
00:08:46,849 --> 00:08:52,789
Scott: Yeah Which is vastly superior Appreciate the organist when you don't have it.

144
00:08:53,111 --> 00:08:59,050
Rym: Yeah, I appreciate both the organist and the fact that there is still no mascot at the New York Rangers.

145
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:00,839
Rym: It'll remain that way.

146
00:09:00,859 --> 00:09:01,383
Scott: That's right.

147
00:09:01,604 --> 00:09:01,826
Scott: Mr.

148
00:09:01,866 --> 00:09:02,370
Scott: Matt was okay.

149
00:09:04,214 --> 00:09:07,090
Rym: I guess he's got a good head anyway, so what he got in the news?

150
00:09:07,812 --> 00:09:11,365
Scott: So there's this thing called photo Kina which happened I think in Germany.

151
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:12,388
Scott: pretty sure isn't German.

152
00:09:13,151 --> 00:09:16,179
Scott: Anyway, photo Kina is basically like the e3 of cameras.

153
00:09:16,721 --> 00:09:19,890
Scott: if you're a photography video person like that's where it's at.

154
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:21,576
Scott: It's pretty much just expo Hall.

155
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:24,065
Scott: It's mostly for the media as a person.

156
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:30,210
Scott: There isn't really a reason to go there You know, but if photo is your number one thing then I guess it's worth it to go there.

157
00:09:30,411 --> 00:09:33,985
Scott: I you know, I guess it'd be the packs of you know They have.

158
00:09:34,005 --> 00:09:42,430
Scott: you know All the companies set up also like things like interesting environments to shoot cameras in so that you can have fun taking photos I guess whatever.

159
00:09:43,552 --> 00:09:50,260
Scott: So there are many news is there and since you know, we don't care too much about photography Let's go through the biggest only the biggest big ones quickly, right?

160
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,767
Rym: Yeah, because you care about twice as much as I do, right?

161
00:09:53,108 --> 00:10:08,730
Scott: So Panasonic which we care about because I have all micro four-thirds cameras and Olympus are like the micro four-thirds Kings, right but Panasonic has announced that they're putting out a full-frame camera in cooperation with Leica and Sigma.

162
00:10:09,051 --> 00:10:13,064
Rym: Oh, I actually saw this news in multiple independent channels on my own.

163
00:10:13,185 --> 00:10:20,826
Scott: So it's a three company Cooperation to make this L mount right with a full-frame mirrorless camera.

164
00:10:20,846 --> 00:10:28,429
Scott: now before Photokina Nikon and Canon pretty much, you know numbers one and two up there with Sony the big three, right?

165
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:35,710
Scott: Canon and Nikon both announced full-frame mirrorless cameras because right now Sony is basically the king of the full-frame mirrorless.

166
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:43,958
Scott: All right, if full-frame means that the sensor is as big as actual 35 millimeter film Photos would be like meanwhile like.

167
00:10:44,319 --> 00:10:47,170
Rym: but so I have a gx1 and then I bought this new camcorder.

168
00:10:47,371 --> 00:10:49,199
Scott: I got four thirds is like a quarter of the size.

169
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:56,367
Rym: Yep, and my camcorder is its big deal Is it has a one inch sense even smaller than which is smaller than both of those, right?

170
00:10:56,387 --> 00:10:57,190
Scott: It's even smaller.

171
00:10:58,651 --> 00:11:11,150
Scott: But yeah, so basically now because Canon and Nikon announced before Photokina they're getting in the game Everyone's got full-frame 35 millimeter size sensors on mirrorless cameras doing 4k video and photo and everything.

172
00:11:11,652 --> 00:11:13,140
Scott: So it's gonna be this huge battle.

173
00:11:13,221 --> 00:11:15,050
Scott: It's like well can Sony hold on?

174
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:21,090
Scott: Can Canon and Nikon with their existing, you know, you know rain over the photo world?

175
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:21,531
Scott: Can they?

176
00:11:21,571 --> 00:11:26,490
Scott: but can they come in and can have this merger of three companies together?

177
00:11:27,492 --> 00:11:29,622
Scott: Right - you know that are pretty big and serious.

178
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,470
Scott: Can they you know, can they be the king?

179
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:37,340
Scott: So it's you got four different mount lens mounts to choose from and we'll see which one is the winner.

180
00:11:37,702 --> 00:11:47,342
Scott: right because the only thing that the The you know the Panasonic that we use in terms of being a you know An SLR style looking camera that shoots video.

181
00:11:47,784 --> 00:11:52,730
Scott: The only reason it was Inferior to say the Sony is the sensor was smaller.

182
00:11:52,830 --> 00:12:00,983
Scott: Therefore the light sensitivity was less and therefore the autofocus is worse, but in all other ways it was perfect Right, so we'll see.

183
00:12:01,023 --> 00:12:01,990
Scott: who can you know?

184
00:12:03,212 --> 00:12:04,777
Scott: Be the king of all these things now.

185
00:12:04,837 --> 00:12:07,948
Scott: There's a four-way battle and not just Sony holding on to everything.

186
00:12:08,149 --> 00:12:10,870
Scott: Yep In other news, there's some weird company.

187
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:23,010
Scott: this is like a big deal right because Leica who makes basically if you don't know like it is a company that Makes cameras that are like ridiculously overpriced because of the brand name sort of like designer handbags, right?

188
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:28,109
Scott: They're like tens of thousands of dollars, but you can get a better camera cheaper from someone else.

189
00:12:28,854 --> 00:12:29,580
Rym: Like they're not bad.

190
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,075
Scott: cameras cost way too much Dollars, I mean you're getting.

191
00:12:33,095 --> 00:12:36,165
Scott: it's sort of like buying a. you know a Ferrari about a camera, right?

192
00:12:36,587 --> 00:12:37,329
Scott: It's not a bad guy.

193
00:12:39,377 --> 00:12:45,701
Scott: But one of the things about Leica is that they make one of the only Full frame digital rangefinder cameras like.

194
00:12:45,721 --> 00:12:48,190
Scott: the only one is the Leica M for a zillion dollars, right?

195
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:55,769
Scott: You can't really get one from anyone else, but now zenith some weird It seems like like is even Collaborating with them in some way.

196
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,673
Scott: zenit As made.

197
00:12:59,693 --> 00:13:00,816
Scott: it's some Russian company.

198
00:13:01,036 --> 00:13:04,045
Scott: They're making an M mount, you know camera.

199
00:13:04,065 --> 00:13:05,810
Scott: Oh, no, is that the L mount?

200
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,877
Scott: Oh, it might have the L mount.

201
00:13:07,957 --> 00:13:10,030
Scott: I don't know the point M with the L mount.

202
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,960
Rym: Yeah, L mount like a kebab a blood after announced pen.

203
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,787
Scott: the point is it's the only non.

204
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:15,610
Scott: like a camera.

205
00:13:15,812 --> 00:13:22,626
Scott: That is a rangefinder style camera That's digital camera with a full-frame sensor on it other than the Leica M and is supposedly.

206
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:27,122
Scott: I'm sure it'll still be expensive But it will be cheaper than the Leica M which is crazy expensive.

207
00:13:27,142 --> 00:13:29,029
Scott: If anyone wins a lottery feel free to buy me one.

208
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:35,444
Scott: And then you know people are like well micro four-thirds that's gonna be dead.

209
00:13:35,504 --> 00:13:42,459
Scott: now, right because you know Panasonic is Olympus didn't make any announcements and Panasonic is joining this other thing.

210
00:13:42,579 --> 00:13:43,443
Scott: Yeah, right is the?

211
00:13:43,504 --> 00:13:44,830
Scott: is micro four-thirds gonna die?

212
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:54,770
Scott: Well, in case you thought it was gonna die, they're making a 10 to 25 millimeter f1.7 lens Which is the maybe the fastest zoom lens ever made and that's a micro four-thirds lens.

213
00:13:55,372 --> 00:13:58,602
Scott: So if anyone wants to buy me that it'll probably be $2,000.

214
00:13:58,602 --> 00:14:00,950
Rym: that'll probably cost as much as my entire camcorder.

215
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,797
Scott: Yeah, feel free to send me one of those.

216
00:14:02,897 --> 00:14:03,519
Scott: it's coming out.

217
00:14:04,001 --> 00:14:06,450
Scott: And the only other big news is that Fuji, right?

218
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,058
Scott: I have an old Fuji film camera.

219
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:09,786
Scott: It's the G. What's it called?

220
00:14:09,826 --> 00:14:10,188
Scott: It's like the.

221
00:14:11,331 --> 00:14:32,766
Scott: It's like the the six by nine and basically it's medium format film, but you shoot basically a you know normal two by three aspect ratio image Which is like takes up twice the normal space when you're shooting like, you know squares We know those people shoot on medium format Alright, so you can take half as many photos and it's like a giant rangefinder camera.

222
00:14:32,786 --> 00:14:33,710
Scott: It's enormous, right?

223
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:37,278
Scott: Awhile ago Fuji came out with medium format.

224
00:14:37,298 --> 00:14:39,585
Scott: They're like fuck you full-frame 35 millimeter.

225
00:14:39,605 --> 00:14:43,367
Scott: We're going medium format digital I. but that camera was insane.

226
00:14:43,407 --> 00:14:48,424
Scott: price You know, but now they have announced a rangefinder style.

227
00:14:48,484 --> 00:14:56,568
Scott: it's not actually a rangefinder because you can't see through it It's just a. you know, they just position the viewfinder in the corner, but it's a medium format digital rangefinder.

228
00:14:56,628 --> 00:14:57,250
Scott: It's insane.

229
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:59,782
Scott: It's like the GFX 50 ours.

230
00:14:59,802 --> 00:15:01,410
Scott: I can't even like.

231
00:15:02,491 --> 00:15:07,110
Scott: That's like, you know, the film one that I have was like super cheap on eBay because it's a film cameras.

232
00:15:07,271 --> 00:15:08,715
Scott: It does not even take batteries.

233
00:15:09,077 --> 00:15:10,341
Rym: Well, I mean click right.

234
00:15:10,522 --> 00:15:12,930
Scott: I think it's just a lens and a box and it's huge.

235
00:15:13,271 --> 00:15:17,873
Scott: This is digital and it takes pictures as big as Right.

236
00:15:17,973 --> 00:15:18,876
Scott: It's like holy shit.

237
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:23,170
Rym: Well, there's definitely I think like there's only really three markets for cameras these days.

238
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:27,430
Rym: There's cell phone camera, which is what most people will use for most photography forever.

239
00:15:27,611 --> 00:15:30,590
Scott: Now a cell phone camera is better than most cameras.

240
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:37,681
Scott: So in order for it to be worth it to buy a camera that is not a phone Yeah, it has to be an insane camera.

241
00:15:37,701 --> 00:15:45,333
Rym: So market number two for real cameras That normal people have no business using because they don't need them for the kinds of pictures They're taking.

242
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:48,550
Rym: and then there is a middle ground and I've seen this partly because of where I work.

243
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,809
Rym: I hear a lot of the ads that are targeted at older people.

244
00:15:51,331 --> 00:16:04,681
Rym: there are a lot of people who just don't understand how to use their phone cameras mostly because they're old and They buy these digital cameras that are one click with no buttons on them And there's still a thriving market for those.

245
00:16:04,761 --> 00:16:11,150
Scott: Some of those are really good too because you know It's not better and better enough than a phone camera exactly.

246
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:16,890
Rym: But there's basically like if you took like my old gx1 and just put it in like auto auto auto the most auto mode.

247
00:16:16,971 --> 00:16:18,630
Scott: Right, there's one more thing.

248
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:19,720
Scott: This is really fascinating.

249
00:16:19,781 --> 00:16:27,895
Scott: for a long time Various companies tried to put out Android phones mostly Android phones because you can't make an iPhone that had insane Cameras on the back.

250
00:16:28,096 --> 00:16:29,321
Rym: even the one I bought is like.

251
00:16:29,361 --> 00:16:39,170
Scott: the big part of its advertising was the crazy Look at like the Panasonic like cm1 The ones that have like that little lens they have like a big-ass zoom lens on the back of your phone, right?

252
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:43,230
Scott: It's like it's like a actual serious camera with a giant lens.

253
00:16:43,395 --> 00:16:44,152
Rym: Yeah You don't need.

254
00:16:44,172 --> 00:16:46,721
Scott: many companies have tried to do that and it's always failed.

255
00:16:46,781 --> 00:16:51,630
Scott: because who wants to carry around this big stupid lens in The back of your phone all the time, right?

256
00:16:51,750 --> 00:17:00,370
Rym: Just see when you take a picture to be really good granted Even though I see so many people now sticking those giant suction pucks on the back of their phone to hold it easier I don't understand those.

257
00:17:00,412 --> 00:17:02,984
Scott: Yeah Tried them out and someone was like, oh it'll change your life.

258
00:17:03,084 --> 00:17:04,089
Scott: Once you try it, you'll understand.

259
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:06,121
Rym: Yeah, I can't put my phone in my pocket anymore.

260
00:17:06,262 --> 00:17:07,387
Scott: Yeah, I took it off real quick.

261
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:08,816
Scott: Anyway I'm gonna.

262
00:17:08,857 --> 00:17:10,712
Rym: I can make some GeekNights ones though If you guys want them.

263
00:17:10,992 --> 00:17:15,210
Scott: Zeiss who makes great lenses announces a zx1 full-frame compact.

264
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,796
Scott: So this is a camera.

265
00:17:16,816 --> 00:17:17,858
Scott: You can't change the lens.

266
00:17:18,241 --> 00:17:20,970
Scott: No, it's a compact camera, but it's full-frame.

267
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:22,990
Scott: So like whoa, it's gonna take crazy good pictures.

268
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:23,873
Scott: It's a crazy good.

269
00:17:23,913 --> 00:17:26,821
Scott: lens is 35 f2 which is a lens that you can use.

270
00:17:27,143 --> 00:17:29,330
Scott: basically that's like the perfect all-around lens.

271
00:17:31,128 --> 00:17:52,389
Scott: And This camera is really interesting because instead of being a phone With a big-ass camera attached to it that you would carry with you everywhere this is a camera but on the back of the camera is Basically a computer that's running Android and you can have light room Mobile lightroom installed in the camera.

272
00:17:54,371 --> 00:17:55,336
Scott: Hello, that's great.

273
00:17:55,517 --> 00:17:56,522
Scott: That's like fantastic.

274
00:17:57,024 --> 00:17:58,190
Scott: I can't believe that's like the greatest.

275
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:00,504
Scott: I don't know why other companies are still using.

276
00:18:00,524 --> 00:18:01,510
Scott: they're like very limited.

277
00:18:01,932 --> 00:18:09,445
Scott: You know camera OS is and firmwares when you could just be putting Android on the camera and just have everyone have all the photo apps in their camera.

278
00:18:09,465 --> 00:18:10,409
Scott: I don't get it.

279
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:11,254
Rym: No, it'd be extra nice.

280
00:18:11,274 --> 00:18:12,140
Scott: This is the greatest.

281
00:18:12,442 --> 00:18:12,905
Scott: why isn't?

282
00:18:13,207 --> 00:18:13,750
Scott: I don't know.

283
00:18:13,811 --> 00:18:16,049
Scott: I've taken this long for even one company to do it.

284
00:18:16,331 --> 00:18:19,082
Scott: I feel like this should bet should be the default that would.

285
00:18:19,202 --> 00:18:21,009
Scott: that was established five ten years ago.

286
00:18:21,551 --> 00:18:32,421
Rym: I have to use it though to see like how well the pipeline works because I'm assuming there's no special features of that OS Things like setting up Just like having an Android phone.

287
00:18:32,602 --> 00:18:36,380
Scott: only it would only have Photo apps and like that.

288
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:43,124
Scott: when you turn it on the camera app is automatically open Yeah, and it's just photo library and photo editing apps and nothing else.

289
00:18:43,726 --> 00:18:44,127
Scott: No other.

290
00:18:44,167 --> 00:18:48,010
Scott: no web browser Right, you know, but it would still have like Wi-Fi stuff, right?

291
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:54,680
Scott: So you still upload you would still do all in all the features of those photo apps would be there But nothing else.

292
00:18:54,821 --> 00:18:55,930
Scott: what you don't need web browser on there.

293
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,909
Scott: I guess you could have the web browser on there, but you would never use it.

294
00:18:59,731 --> 00:19:11,182
Rym: Yeah, I mean it's hard to see the market of who would actually use that Because I really wanted to use like my nice monitor and my big screen when I mess with my photos And if I'm on the go, I really don't do anything to the photos.

295
00:19:11,242 --> 00:19:13,170
Scott: I'm sure this thing won't be the cheapest.

296
00:19:13,433 --> 00:19:24,090
Scott: I'm sure it'll be probably You know thousands of dollars because it's a got it, you know, really fancy, you know, it's a full-frame sensor Yeah, and it's a really crazy good lens.

297
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:33,579
Scott: But this would be like if you were going to if you wanted to buy a camera to carry around with you every day To use for every day better than cell phone.

298
00:19:33,659 --> 00:19:36,086
Scott: photography like this would be a great candidate.

299
00:19:36,186 --> 00:19:37,550
Scott: or wait for version 2 of this.

300
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:42,370
Rym: Yeah, I feel like wait version 2 or at least wait for reviews is gonna be the key here.

301
00:19:42,491 --> 00:19:45,009
Scott: Yeah, but you know, it looks like that's crazy good.

302
00:19:46,032 --> 00:19:52,597
Rym: So in some other non photography news if you didn't notice Facebook had a Security breach.

303
00:19:52,879 --> 00:19:56,782
Rym: dun dun dun and Every day as more information has come out.

304
00:19:56,842 --> 00:19:58,330
Rym: It's actually gotten worse and worse.

305
00:19:58,451 --> 00:19:58,893
Rym: Like what.

306
00:19:59,175 --> 00:20:08,210
Rym: this is actually a really really big deal And it's relevant to the main bit of the show because a big part of why Facebook breaches are such a problem.

307
00:20:08,732 --> 00:20:16,969
Rym: on one hand you've got people putting tons and tons and tons of private information in there and Just having it available for whoever's gonna hack in and steal it.

308
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:25,070
Rym: But to a lot of people a lot of organizations a lot of schools a lot of like local government shit.

309
00:20:25,632 --> 00:20:27,420
Rym: Use Facebook single sign-on.

310
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,850
Scott: Yeah, like you'll go for I only use it I think with Spotify.

311
00:20:29,971 --> 00:20:36,024
Scott: So when I go to Spotify instead of having to remember my Spotify password I can just push the blue button that says login with Facebook.

312
00:20:36,044 --> 00:20:36,807
Scott: Yeah logged in.

313
00:20:37,189 --> 00:20:40,293
Rym: now I can't say like oh, I don't have a Facebook account Which I don't.

314
00:20:40,534 --> 00:20:43,871
Rym: so this doesn't affect me because I do the exact same thing with Google Like.

315
00:20:43,891 --> 00:20:47,145
Rym: I use Google single sign-on for almost every account I have.

316
00:20:47,245 --> 00:20:48,350
Scott: I use it in a few places.

317
00:20:49,311 --> 00:20:52,430
Rym: Almost everything I do as uses Google single sign-on at this point is Spotify.

318
00:20:52,450 --> 00:21:18,560
Rym: I have a standalone account because I'd still don't have a Facebook account, but basically this vulnerability I didn't read all the full details yet But it looks like the access tokens that would be used for like an app or another application to interact with your Facebook account Were able to be collected and/or stolen and then used later which already implies a pretty serious But fundamental flaw in their model.

319
00:21:19,282 --> 00:21:21,730
Scott: and even worse is Oh off doesn't have that fly.

320
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,337
Scott: I figured it was just Oh off though.

321
00:21:23,357 --> 00:21:26,450
Rym: Apparently I was reading Oh off has a few flaws as well.

322
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,557
Rym: I found a bunch of articles implemented correctly.

323
00:21:28,878 --> 00:21:36,670
Scott: Oh, yeah, I mean people implement, you know things incorrectly all the time You know, it's like oh, yes my oh SSH that I wrote is flawed.

324
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:37,634
Scott: Yeah, that's open.

325
00:21:37,735 --> 00:21:39,061
Scott: SSH implements it properly.

326
00:21:39,101 --> 00:21:41,090
Rym: Well, it's like the people who said oh PGP is broken.

327
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,436
Rym: No, PGP is not broken.

328
00:21:42,536 --> 00:21:45,830
Rym: Just PGP with mime in your email client is broken.

329
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:49,430
Scott: You know that particular PGP software that's called PGP is broken.

330
00:21:49,771 --> 00:21:54,010
Scott: That doesn't mean that the RSA algorithm of making public and private keys is broke.

331
00:21:54,010 --> 00:22:11,130
Rym: Yeah, well you have to kind of like goes back to the fundamental point that most issues with security come down to either Something is implemented improperly compared to even like basics documentation or just bad operational security Like someone writes their password down somewhere or tell someone their pin on the phone.

332
00:22:11,992 --> 00:22:25,985
Rym: But basically anyone who used this vulnerability, which it's not clear if and how it was used I would not be surprised if it had been used by say state-sponsored actors quite a bit considering all the things happen around the election and Facebook and everything.

333
00:22:26,005 --> 00:22:34,007
Rym: but basically anyone who used this on your account could then use that to create or sign into accounts on anything else.

334
00:22:34,047 --> 00:22:35,597
Rym: that's using Facebook single sign-on.

335
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:50,709
Rym: and Furthermore it appears based on some articles I was reading that Facebook doesn't even have Logging of when these tokens are used if the sessions are short meaning less than a half an hour or an hour or so.

336
00:22:51,624 --> 00:23:07,570
Rym: so Basically, we don't know and may never know how widely this was used and it is a super super egregious security flaw Mm-hmm, so what can the average listener of GeekNights do to prevent this from happening other than just not having a Facebook account?

337
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:08,594
Scott: Delete your Facebook.

338
00:23:08,874 --> 00:23:14,570
Scott: Yeah, I mean the only reason I have a Facebook account is because there's still like a GeekNights Facebook page And I'm not sure what will happen.

339
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:17,710
Scott: Like if I like my account is the only one has permission to like to handle it.

340
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,103
Scott: So, I don't know if it happens if I delete it.

341
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:25,790
Rym: The problem is even those fake pages like not every person who friends or whatever that page.

342
00:23:26,052 --> 00:23:28,670
Rym: We'll see every update on that page because of Facebook's weird money.

343
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:32,366
Scott: Yeah, I know I don't use Facebook that much but it's like, you know, I have the account.

344
00:23:32,407 --> 00:23:33,150
Scott: the stuff is set up.

345
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,195
Scott: I just sort of that's it.

346
00:23:34,235 --> 00:23:34,617
Rym: I'm curious.

347
00:23:34,657 --> 00:23:37,069
Rym: What's the difference between that much and just delete it?

348
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,276
Scott: Well, it's not it's just.

349
00:23:39,396 --> 00:23:42,170
Scott: it's basically holding the account is basically holding the pages.

350
00:23:42,492 --> 00:23:44,904
Rym: Yeah, but I mean like personally like your personal Facebook account.

351
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:45,588
Rym: What do you do with it?

352
00:23:47,091 --> 00:23:48,535
Scott: Some I read other people's Facebooks.

353
00:23:49,217 --> 00:23:52,167
Rym: Oh, why a little bit see I just avoid even that.

354
00:23:52,548 --> 00:23:57,710
Scott: Hmm Some people there's some idiot friends of ours who keep posting their stuff there instead of Twitter.

355
00:23:58,266 --> 00:24:04,131
Rym: Yep I continue to try to force those people to just email me or use Twitter or I think the thing is like they're posting their Things.

356
00:24:04,172 --> 00:24:09,974
Scott: they're not because they're they're posting them there for their biological families to see.

357
00:24:10,274 --> 00:24:18,519
Rym: yep, right at least I've seen the perception like definitely people younger than us do not trust Facebook and do not Use it and it's the old person social media network.

358
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,290
Rym: So I feel like this situation is going to over time correct itself.

359
00:24:21,612 --> 00:24:35,690
Rym: Hmm, but yeah almost everyone I know who posts a lot to Facebook is doing it because they know other people who are incapable of using modern social media Usually like old relatives like even my brother like he's not on any social media, but Facebook.

360
00:24:36,212 --> 00:24:40,246
Rym: So like I never see what he's up to unless I just call him and it's kind of weird.

361
00:24:40,266 --> 00:24:40,587
Rym: Mm-hmm.

362
00:24:46,412 --> 00:24:48,510
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

363
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:51,900
Rym: So have you ever played Mario the paper Mario the thousand-year door?

364
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,694
Scott: the best Mario RPG maybe even one of the best RPGs there is?

365
00:24:57,316 --> 00:24:58,901
Scott: it's bad fight me on this.

366
00:24:58,961 --> 00:25:00,807
Scott: It's better than Mario RPG and SNES.

367
00:25:01,188 --> 00:25:01,970
Scott: It's even better.

368
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,297
Scott: I mean not that these games are bad.

369
00:25:03,337 --> 00:25:05,789
Scott: mom saying is that Mario RPG and SNES is a good game.

370
00:25:06,211 --> 00:25:08,220
Scott: Right Mario Mario and Luigi.

371
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:11,774
Scott: that series especially the first one on GBA Those are good games.

372
00:25:12,055 --> 00:25:14,505
Scott: thousand-year door is even better than those games.

373
00:25:14,545 --> 00:25:15,288
Scott: That's how good it is.

374
00:25:15,791 --> 00:25:19,050
Scott: Yeah, if you haven't played thousand-year door on the game of cube play that shit.

375
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:22,703
Scott: It's even as a as a game that is like a JRPG.

376
00:25:22,803 --> 00:25:24,710
Scott: It is still playable by old man Scott.

377
00:25:25,113 --> 00:25:27,490
Scott: Never come out on the switch cuz I should probably play it.

378
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:27,751
Scott: I never.

379
00:25:27,791 --> 00:25:32,569
Scott: actually might have to like pay and maybe it'll come out and if you like buy the online service.

380
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:37,284
Rym: cuz In the online service, they'll just borrow your old GameCube.

381
00:25:37,304 --> 00:25:38,447
Scott: you you could.

382
00:25:38,507 --> 00:25:38,748
Scott: I have.

383
00:25:38,768 --> 00:25:39,390
Scott: I don't have a GameCube.

384
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:41,003
Scott: I have a Wii that plays GameCube discs.

385
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:43,021
Scott: Oh And I have the disc.

386
00:25:43,142 --> 00:25:43,930
Rym: What'd you do with the GameCube?

387
00:25:45,071 --> 00:25:46,214
Scott: It's gone gone.

388
00:25:46,234 --> 00:25:47,037
Scott: You go.

389
00:25:47,117 --> 00:25:47,638
Rym: Did what happened?

390
00:25:47,658 --> 00:25:48,160
Rym: Did it die?

391
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:51,330
Scott: I think when I got the Wii, I think I just left it somewhere.

392
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:55,640
Rym: I Still have those two NES is up there.

393
00:25:56,062 --> 00:25:56,203
Scott: Now.

394
00:25:56,243 --> 00:25:57,268
Scott: One of those is my childhood.

395
00:25:57,369 --> 00:26:03,961
Rym: Yes Yeah, the other one is the one that we won at Ohio con 2002 in the duck hunt turn.

396
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:04,584
Scott: It's neither.

397
00:26:04,644 --> 00:26:05,770
Scott: one of those are your NES.

398
00:26:06,313 --> 00:26:07,762
Rym: Well the one I won the tournament.

399
00:26:07,782 --> 00:26:12,747
Rym: So one of those is my NES And my other NES from when I was a kid, my brother has it still.

400
00:26:14,232 --> 00:26:19,905
Rym: But if you played this game There is a giant bomb guy who has a happy-lucky lottery.

401
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:21,030
Rym: We can buy a lottery ticket.

402
00:26:22,112 --> 00:26:24,097
Rym: Someone Strider 7x.

403
00:26:24,137 --> 00:26:34,517
Rym: I think we featured him before on GeekNights went through 13 minutes of explaining in detail how this lottery works and how Specifically it is rigged.

404
00:26:34,838 --> 00:26:55,104
Rym: and basically to win the lottery in Mario thousand-year door you have to play the game for over a year of real time and Then you have to talk to that guy on the specific day between 335 and 390 something days after you bought that lottery ticket.

405
00:26:55,425 --> 00:26:57,901
Rym: and if you talk to him on that day That is the day you will win.

406
00:26:57,921 --> 00:27:06,350
Rym: and the four numbers They show you are random numbers and the whole system is rigged in a really like interesting and oddly specific way.

407
00:27:06,471 --> 00:27:15,202
Scott: Yeah, that game even though it's like this, you know I just played it from beginning to end and only got extra stuff that was easily accessible That game has a surprising amount of like.

408
00:27:15,242 --> 00:27:25,949
Scott: if you want to keep going replay value There's an area where you go down a pipe and fight some guys And then it keeps going down like you just basically just like it's a lot like the the tower of enemies

409
00:27:27,231 --> 00:27:27,592
Rym: Yeah,

410
00:27:27,713 --> 00:27:30,646
Scott: or you know or like get backers the anime

411
00:27:31,409 --> 00:27:31,550
Rym: what?

412
00:27:33,111 --> 00:27:34,300
Rym: I'm surprised did not remember.

413
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:35,529
Rym: get backers even existed.

414
00:27:36,593 --> 00:27:37,359
Scott: You know, it's just like.

415
00:27:37,379 --> 00:27:40,140
Scott: it's just like a tournament you go in the pipe You fight guys until you lose.

416
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:43,058
Scott: if you lose you get kicked out at the beginning But if you keep winning keep going down the pipes.

417
00:27:43,199 --> 00:27:43,420
Rym: Yep.

418
00:27:44,024 --> 00:27:47,457
Rym: Anyway, so yeah, if you watch this You'll know to never buy that stupid lottery ticket.

419
00:27:47,477 --> 00:27:54,501
Rym: because then and he also catches if you change the date to win the lottery Because when you change the bait date back the dude freaks out.

420
00:27:54,541 --> 00:27:57,770
Rym: it makes you buy a new lottery ticket for like 500 gold anyway.

421
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:00,489
Scott: So check this out.

422
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:16,878
Scott: here is some sort of festival in China somewhere where they're playing some sort of flute a weird-looking flute that's fat on one side and One of the people who I think supposedly is maybe the organizer of this event is playing the flute Upside-down backwards.

423
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:19,610
Scott: You're supposed to play it with the fat end near your face.

424
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:22,044
Rym: There's a moment where she makes eye contact with guy next to her.

425
00:28:22,064 --> 00:28:22,929
Rym: He keeps looking at her.

426
00:28:23,392 --> 00:28:24,416
Rym: I don't know if he's trying to like.

427
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:26,144
Scott: hey, so I the.

428
00:28:26,224 --> 00:28:33,550
Scott: the story that I was told I don't know how true it is is that she didn't want to like ruin the performance by like flipping it around.

429
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,256
Scott: You know like disturb the thing.

430
00:28:35,517 --> 00:28:38,830
Scott: so she like oh, yeah, the guy like starts gesturing gesturing to her like hey, right?

431
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:40,617
Scott: So the guy tries to correct her.

432
00:28:40,657 --> 00:28:43,468
Scott: like hey flip your flute around and she's like no, I don't want to.

433
00:28:45,331 --> 00:28:55,576
Scott: And this is basically the story of my life and where I'm the guy Right like when you're biking over the bridge, and you're like hey young child Who's having trouble struggling up this bridge.

434
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:59,750
Rym: if you just change that gear to be an easier one this will be no problem.

435
00:29:00,313 --> 00:29:04,234
Scott: Hey person who's obviously stronger than me and going slower than me Why?

436
00:29:04,535 --> 00:29:08,230
Scott: but it's like hey kid who just ran into that goomba right?

437
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:19,224
Scott: This is like press a if you are wondering right as a as a recovering mansplainer If you're wondering where mansplaining comes from there is definitely mansplaining.

438
00:29:19,264 --> 00:29:20,348
Scott: That is just outright.

439
00:29:20,749 --> 00:29:30,922
Scott: You know You know like you're telling wrong things to people or or you know the other kind vice You're giving is an excuse to harass specifically or the kind where you're.

440
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:37,044
Scott: you know there's the kind where someone's wrong like where they go To the woman scientist and like oh, yes, did you know this and this?

441
00:29:37,104 --> 00:29:39,653
Scott: it's like yes, I invented that Right.

442
00:29:39,693 --> 00:29:42,624
Scott: does that mansplaining which I was not guilty of in the past?

443
00:29:42,684 --> 00:29:44,150
Scott: at least I hope not too guilty.

444
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:49,722
Scott: But there is this kind where it's like you see someone doing something wrong.

445
00:29:50,183 --> 00:29:54,813
Scott: right man or woman or other gender the key Objectively wrong.

446
00:29:54,833 --> 00:29:55,957
Scott: exactly what I'm saying.

447
00:29:55,997 --> 00:29:56,157
Scott: right.

448
00:29:56,197 --> 00:30:00,170
Scott: you see someone doing something that you think or know is objectively wrong.

449
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:02,159
Scott: They could be doing better right.

450
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:12,160
Scott: not even just doing something completely wrong like this But also doing something in a not as good way like maybe they're cutting something with a knife And you're a knife master And you want to show them your knife skills and help them out.

451
00:30:12,582 --> 00:30:16,159
Scott: or maybe someone's holding the chopsticks wrong And they're getting food in their mouth, but you're like listen.

452
00:30:16,561 --> 00:30:19,593
Scott: They got to be parallel don't cross the sticks Right.

453
00:30:19,955 --> 00:30:21,083
Scott: and it's like you.

454
00:30:21,204 --> 00:30:33,990
Scott: on the one hand It's like you don't want to be some joke going around telling people how to live their lives But on the other hand you see the frustration of this dude looking at this woman playing this flute upside down.

455
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:36,289
Scott: That is the feeling that I have.

456
00:30:36,851 --> 00:30:46,390
Scott: That is why it is so hard to not mansplain even when I know what it is, so I watched a dude Yesterday, I was doing a long run.

457
00:30:46,471 --> 00:30:53,826
Rym: I ran over the Queensborough bridge And there's a dude who was Near the top like walking his fixie up because he couldn't ride it up and the pedals were moving.

458
00:30:53,846 --> 00:30:54,930
Rym: it's a full-on fixie.

459
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:55,715
Scott: He knew it was a fixie.

460
00:30:55,977 --> 00:30:57,610
Rym: yep, so he's walking it.

461
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,669
Rym: He's near the top and he's about to get on it to ride down.

462
00:31:00,133 --> 00:31:01,222
Rym: So he passes me.

463
00:31:01,242 --> 00:31:11,180
Rym: cuz he starts riding down And then I see him like force himself to a stop and get off and have to walk it down Because it was going too fast and the pedals were gonna start hitting him.

464
00:31:11,902 --> 00:31:19,587
Rym: so his his bike due to his Choice in what kind of bike to ride prevented him from both riding up and riding down hills.

465
00:31:20,229 --> 00:31:23,449
Rym: yep And yet he persists in riding this bike.

466
00:31:24,292 --> 00:31:25,637
Scott: I mean was it a flip-flop hub?

467
00:31:26,098 --> 00:31:33,262
Scott: you could have helped him by flipping his rear wheel around to the to the pretty confident That anyone who has a fixie bike has no idea what that's for.

468
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:35,590
Rym: I feel like they have never flipped their tire.

469
00:31:35,891 --> 00:31:36,896
Scott: I've seen a lot of bikes.

470
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:38,001
Scott: They'd have the flip-flop hub.

471
00:31:38,041 --> 00:31:39,850
Scott: you can just flip the rear tire around backwards.

472
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:41,642
Scott: It's real easy because there's no gears in the way.

473
00:31:41,763 --> 00:31:45,040
Rym: I know, but I feel like You're freewheeling based on fixie people.

474
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:45,442
Rym: I've talked to.

475
00:31:45,482 --> 00:31:46,689
Rym: it's still too much complication.

476
00:31:46,709 --> 00:31:50,806
Rym: I Suspect that extra gear on the other side is just aesthetic.

477
00:31:51,289 --> 00:31:58,098
Rym: yeah I know, but anyway in the meta moment the GeekNights book club book is still Homer's Odyssey Still not updated.

478
00:31:58,118 --> 00:31:59,064
Scott: the website actually was.

479
00:31:59,225 --> 00:32:03,708
Scott: at the other day I was like oh, I should do that right now, and then distracted and then didn't do it.

480
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:07,212
Rym: Yeah, we did previously talk about the Odyssey And we're done.

481
00:32:07,372 --> 00:32:09,899
Scott: the last book club book was Homer's Odyssey.

482
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:16,218
Scott: in our current base book club book is Arthur C. Clark's Space Odyssey 2001.

483
00:32:16,218 --> 00:32:17,020
Rym: it's getting cold.

484
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,424
Scott: I'm gonna be reading a lot more books.

485
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:20,229
Rym: I'm gonna read this pretty quick.

486
00:32:21,371 --> 00:32:29,882
Scott: I've actually read a whole bunch of fantasy books as I'm trying to read all the books on my shelf And I have a digital copy of 2001. so it's not.

487
00:32:30,002 --> 00:32:34,660
Scott: it's not something That's dying to like get off my shelf and out of my apartment.

488
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:41,442
Rym: lately my commutes is so short that I don't really read On my commute, so I only read when I'm sitting down like it's time to read.

489
00:32:41,844 --> 00:32:46,381
Scott: I've been reading more and Watching crappy Korean TV less.

490
00:32:46,863 --> 00:32:47,426
Rym: Oh, that's good.

491
00:32:47,446 --> 00:32:48,109
Rym: That's good, son.

492
00:32:48,691 --> 00:32:49,996
Rym: The problem is you could replay.

493
00:32:50,016 --> 00:32:50,277
Rym: you could.

494
00:32:50,317 --> 00:33:00,150
Rym: instead of watching crappy TV less and reading more you could watch crappy TV less and watch All these great animated shows that are coming out that we just talked about because we judge the upcoming season of anime.

495
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:05,865
Scott: Yeah, I'll get that video out soon because the next anime season starts in like a week the fall season.

496
00:33:06,306 --> 00:33:16,339
Scott: we we judged again We'll let you know our complete guesses based on almost no information and even less knowledge about what those shows are gonna be like.

497
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:25,290
Rym: the most important thing I can say though is that The surest indicator that a show is bad is if it is based on a role-playing game or MMO of any kind.

498
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,855
Scott: Yes, that is you gotta know.

499
00:33:26,875 --> 00:33:31,550
Scott: the upcoming season of anime is mostly shows based on MMOs and JRPGs.

500
00:33:32,532 --> 00:33:34,310
Rym: So yeah, otherwise we talked about this.

501
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:45,550
Rym: We didn't do the show on Thursday because I've been busy and it's gonna take me a while to sort out the pipeline to make This work because it's the most complex Thing we've ever tried to set up to do on an ongoing basis as GeekNights.

502
00:33:45,971 --> 00:33:56,390
Rym: But basically we're gonna try out a few different shows like different like maybe Thursdays to start an Alternate format for GeekNights and I know you're thinking this is crazy.

503
00:33:56,450 --> 00:34:00,223
Rym: You've used the exact same format for 13 plus years and the answer is yes.

504
00:34:00,284 --> 00:34:00,926
Rym: It is crazy.

505
00:34:01,147 --> 00:34:02,090
Rym: This will probably fail.

506
00:34:02,411 --> 00:34:03,675
Scott: We're gonna try to do a show.

507
00:34:03,735 --> 00:34:13,350
Scott: that is the same format as like sports talk radio where you talk and then some crazy Kooky listener calls it and then you shut them up and then you talk some more like yeah the Mets are bums.

508
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:16,746
Scott: Hey, we're gonna hear from Joey Jojo and we lost the first game into the season.

509
00:34:16,766 --> 00:34:17,469
Scott: trade everybody.

510
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:18,033
Scott: Yeah, right.

511
00:34:18,053 --> 00:34:20,404
Scott: We're gonna use that format only we're not gonna talk about sports.

512
00:34:20,424 --> 00:34:21,530
Scott: You're gonna talk about nerdy shit.

513
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:30,969
Scott: Yeah, and the problem we're just gonna get some sort of technology system Whereby the listener can be that jerk who calls in and we let him talk for like 10 seconds now.

514
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:35,670
Rym: I cannot understate the complexity of this because get some maybe use discord or something.

515
00:34:36,195 --> 00:34:37,810
Rym: This is the first time for GeekNights.

516
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:45,743
Rym: We've needed a PA like a production assistant because someone has to talk to the listener and figure out if what the listener is about to say is stupid.

517
00:34:45,763 --> 00:34:49,286
Scott: and Figure out if they're actually gonna come on and say the thing that they said.

518
00:34:49,306 --> 00:34:52,462
Scott: they're gonna say Yeah, I'd say, you know something stupid.

519
00:34:52,522 --> 00:35:04,350
Rym: We need a mechanism to take the Masses the howling masses of people trying to say things and pull one out into a separate private Solo channel and have their audio come into the stream alive.

520
00:35:05,451 --> 00:35:08,384
Rym: So I'm probably with delay, yep, I don't know.

521
00:35:08,505 --> 00:35:12,460
Rym: I could set up a delay circuit But I'm not gonna to start because that's a giant.

522
00:35:12,581 --> 00:35:16,974
Scott: don't tell them that you're supposed to tell this delay Even if there isn't.

523
00:35:17,556 --> 00:35:21,049
Rym: if it's nothing but a bunch of baba booey baba booey that'll in itself be funny.

524
00:35:22,173 --> 00:35:27,889
Rym: No Partly because the bit the purse the kinds of person like the person who will be listening to our stream.

525
00:35:28,671 --> 00:35:28,992
Rym: We're not.

526
00:35:29,012 --> 00:35:39,109
Rym: it's not like the old days where we did that you stream like we streamed ourselves live on the internet a long long time ago and For whatever reason our stream ended up on the front page of that thing.

527
00:35:39,652 --> 00:35:40,417
Rym: And all these like

528
00:35:40,457 --> 00:35:43,189
Scott: I'll think about how few people are on the internet then converted now Yeah

529
00:35:43,615 --> 00:35:51,368
Rym: and suddenly all these like basic normal randos showed up and saw us sitting on a couch talking and our chat went from like

530
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:52,572
Scott: a Message every

531
00:35:52,853 --> 00:35:58,270
Rym: like 30 seconds or so someone saying something to just a flood of what the fuck is this?

532
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:59,779
Rym: Who are these fucking nerds?

533
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:00,909
Rym: What the fuck is this?

534
00:36:01,572 --> 00:36:02,757
Scott: Right imagine if you know it's.

535
00:36:02,837 --> 00:36:04,744
Scott: it's the same way that things work these days.

536
00:36:04,784 --> 00:36:06,330
Scott: only the bar is way hired, right?

537
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:14,663
Scott: Think about how many views you need to have on your twitch stream to get to the front page of twitch and it happens sometimes We're like a mid-tier twitch streamer or mid high tier one.

538
00:36:14,703 --> 00:36:16,110
Scott: that will you know?

539
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:24,705
Scott: They won't be ninja level where they're like number one on twitch for the month But they'll have something special on their stream that brings in a crowd from somewhere.

540
00:36:24,725 --> 00:36:40,441
Scott: Yeah, that will temporarily Momentarily make them the number one channel on twitch at that moment and then people who have never seen that streamer or never seen that game or both will see them on the front page of twitch next to The Pokemon marathon and click on them and then we'll get even more views.

541
00:36:40,461 --> 00:36:43,530
Scott: like a second flood comes in and that's what happened us.

542
00:36:43,711 --> 00:36:46,045
Scott: Only it was way easier for it to happen back in those days.

543
00:36:46,066 --> 00:36:53,269
Rym: Yep in 2006 then in it was just fascinating to see like basic internet people trying to interact with something nerdy.

544
00:36:53,771 --> 00:36:57,306
Rym: It was kind of awesome anyway in a weird way, but we're gonna try to do this.

545
00:36:57,346 --> 00:36:58,130
Rym: so stay tuned.

546
00:36:58,892 --> 00:37:06,130
Rym: You're probably gonna have to use discord because the best pipe lagging up up so far is a discord pipeline where you'll get invited.

547
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:07,775
Rym: You'll see we're gonna work it out.

548
00:37:08,197 --> 00:37:09,461
Scott: We will maybe also.

549
00:37:09,481 --> 00:37:12,210
Scott: maybe we'll just read what people type in on YouTube stream.

550
00:37:12,401 --> 00:37:20,810
Rym: Yeah We will also use the YouTube stream chat and take comments from there that are good and either I'll read them or perhaps I'll have Amazon Polly read them.

551
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:24,346
Scott: So I tell people not to watch the stream, but that that's one time you can come.

552
00:37:24,366 --> 00:37:29,510
Scott: oh Scott Oh, otherwise the show's gonna be real boring.

553
00:37:30,231 --> 00:37:36,690
Rym: There's also a patreon specific streaming service that seems to have some of the stuff built in but I'm not going down that road yet.

554
00:37:36,811 --> 00:37:37,902
Scott: Let's not go down that road.

555
00:37:37,983 --> 00:37:38,347
Rym: Why not?

556
00:37:39,271 --> 00:37:42,080
Rym: It's better on that road that the patreon content is good and is gonna accelerate.

557
00:37:42,101 --> 00:37:42,582
Rym: that road goes.

558
00:37:42,622 --> 00:37:46,840
Rym: No I Just watched that clip again, right.

559
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:47,925
Scott: also PAX Unplugged.

560
00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:48,850
Scott: is the next packs coming up?

561
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:49,372
Scott: You should go.

562
00:37:49,512 --> 00:37:54,250
Scott: if you're anywhere near Philadelphia, or you like tabletop games, or you like packs go to PAX Unplugged.

563
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:54,494
Scott: It's come.

564
00:37:54,534 --> 00:37:55,409
Scott: we will be there.

565
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:59,345
Rym: We will be doing at least one panel and we will be up not gonna log into my.

566
00:37:59,385 --> 00:38:01,615
Rym: I was about to log into my panel Admin account.

567
00:38:01,957 --> 00:38:03,204
Rym: instead of the PAX Unplugged website.

568
00:38:03,505 --> 00:38:04,992
Rym: we will be doing that one But two events.

569
00:38:05,132 --> 00:38:10,610
Rym: one of them will be remember we did a learn to play and learn to win session with Carcassonne.

570
00:38:11,291 --> 00:38:13,360
Rym: So we're doing it with a much more complex game now.

571
00:38:13,801 --> 00:38:15,850
Rym: We're gonna be doing it with Puerto Rico.

572
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:21,550
Rym: We are going to walk through in detail the perfect best possible strategies to be good at Puerto Rico.

573
00:38:21,971 --> 00:38:31,310
Rym: Teach an entire room of people how to play Puerto Rico and then have all those people knowing all these skills Play Puerto Rico against each other and it's gonna be hilarious.

574
00:38:32,411 --> 00:38:39,530
Rym: We're also doing a panel and details TBD, but that panel will be in the live streaming theater from PAX Unplugged.

575
00:38:40,491 --> 00:38:42,920
Rym: so single sign-on because the.

576
00:38:43,301 --> 00:39:00,337
Rym: this is primarily the reason why this Facebook breach was so bad and single sign has actually meant a lot of different things over the years and There's a lot of different ways to implement it and there's no way we're gonna be able to cover all That possible scope and use case.

577
00:39:00,397 --> 00:39:08,907
Scott: but the fundamental idea is that you have some sort of computer system And you got some username password login of some kind or some sort of logging into that system.

578
00:39:09,549 --> 00:39:13,096
Scott: now Let's say you got a company and your company has you know?

579
00:39:13,116 --> 00:39:14,378
Scott: you got an HR system.

580
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:15,360
Scott: you got an email.

581
00:39:16,152 --> 00:39:17,018
Scott: You got what else.

582
00:39:17,038 --> 00:39:18,529
Scott: you guys some file storage system.

583
00:39:18,717 --> 00:39:27,084
Scott: Yeah You got a bunch of systems at your company and people got to make fucking username and passwords for all these fucking different things Right that are not attached to each other.

584
00:39:27,165 --> 00:39:27,728
Scott: and you know what?

585
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:32,910
Scott: Microsoft if you're use all Microsoft for example or all Apple for example, right?

586
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:36,105
Scott: They have systems set up where you can have single sign on.

587
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:37,070
Scott: so Microsoft use it.

588
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:42,470
Scott: You'll set up an active directory server and then all your other which is basically just a fancy LDAP server, right?

589
00:39:42,470 --> 00:40:04,790
Scott: it's a fancy LDAP server and You'll make all your employees accounts on that active directory server and now if they want to log into their Windows computer, or they want to log into Microsoft Exchange or Microsoft SharePoint or Almost any other system that you have at your company They're using that same username and password that they set up on there.

590
00:40:05,118 --> 00:40:11,769
Scott: You know Active directory account and that one account controls the logging in to all the different systems of the company.

591
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:14,799
Scott: now You don't have to remember different passwords when you reset your password.

592
00:40:14,899 --> 00:40:20,221
Scott: once you reset it everywhere, you know, it's it's really good It's very convenient to do.

593
00:40:20,382 --> 00:40:24,619
Rym: Yep, and it provides Centralized control for things like policy like right.

594
00:40:24,779 --> 00:40:26,827
Scott: I fired someone I fired this person.

595
00:40:26,887 --> 00:40:27,610
Scott: I delete their account.

596
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:30,021
Scott: I don't have to delete their account in ten fucking different places.

597
00:40:30,041 --> 00:40:30,342
Rym: Yep.

598
00:40:30,383 --> 00:40:31,990
Rym: Joey Jojo forgot his password.

599
00:40:32,171 --> 00:40:35,770
Rym: You just fix it once you don't have to go to his PC physically to deal with it.

600
00:40:35,951 --> 00:40:36,936
Scott: Yeah, oh I have to.

601
00:40:37,036 --> 00:40:39,590
Scott: you know, this person has less access than they had before.

602
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:42,261
Scott: Well, I can change all their access to different systems in one place.

603
00:40:42,623 --> 00:40:47,081
Scott: I don't have to log in on the administrator I don't have to log in now to ten different places because guess what?

604
00:40:47,101 --> 00:40:49,310
Scott: My administrator account is also an active directory.

605
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:55,050
Rym: Yeah, I can go to any computer as the administrator log in as the admin and fix something locally if I need to.

606
00:40:55,132 --> 00:40:59,171
Scott: Yeah Employees can just like swap computers and log in and they'll be good to go You can.

607
00:40:59,232 --> 00:41:05,690
Scott: there's so many like convenient advantages to doing this assuming your active directory set up properly works properly.

608
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:09,980
Scott: Right your network is working Assuming everything works.

609
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,170
Scott: We're not gonna talk about when shit doesn't work this.

610
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:13,089
Scott: Yeah, that's off topic.

611
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:13,732
Scott: But the main

612
00:41:13,752 --> 00:41:15,478
Rym: limitation of that is that

613
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:18,650
Scott: except for maybe the fact that it's a little tricky to make everything always work

614
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:23,022
Rym: It is like unless it is your job Like ad is kind of hard to set up and get right

615
00:41:23,062 --> 00:41:25,472
Scott: but not even pretty much any system That's similar.

616
00:41:25,553 --> 00:41:33,208
Scott: your is gonna have a fickle problems, right people often rarely set these things up perfectly But we're gonna assume that you did.

617
00:41:33,725 --> 00:41:34,187
Rym: Yeah Good job.

618
00:41:34,551 --> 00:41:40,693
Rym: Now the idea of this in terms of like the span of the history of computing is still actually Relatively new.

619
00:41:40,753 --> 00:41:44,530
Rym: like early computers didn't have logons you powered them on and they just process.

620
00:41:44,691 --> 00:41:50,478
Scott: Yeah, technically you could do this sort of thing with like Windows 3.11 for work groups.

621
00:41:50,498 --> 00:41:51,723
Rym: That's the first Windows I had.

622
00:41:52,104 --> 00:41:55,876
Scott: I think you could do it with that But you're lucky if you could.

623
00:41:56,037 --> 00:42:02,903
Scott: even even Windows NT Windows 2000 if you could set up this sort of single sign-on Man, you are killing it dude.

624
00:42:03,064 --> 00:42:07,570
Scott: Like they had the feature But if you could set it up properly in those days you were ahead of the curve.

625
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:08,433
Scott: You're serious.

626
00:42:08,453 --> 00:42:09,698
Scott: like almost no one could do it.

627
00:42:09,718 --> 00:42:12,548
Rym: probably that only existed in like big companies.

628
00:42:12,729 --> 00:42:15,200
Scott: nowadays People don't even always get it right.

629
00:42:15,743 --> 00:42:17,150
Scott: Yeah, even though it's much easier than it.

630
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:20,870
Rym: But in nowadays like I didn't bother but my NAS can run Active Directory.

631
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:25,890
Rym: I could totally just have a domain in the apartment and let's set up all sorts of cool admin stuff.

632
00:42:26,031 --> 00:42:26,514
Rym: I just don't care.

633
00:42:26,534 --> 00:42:27,119
Scott: There's no point.

634
00:42:27,804 --> 00:42:28,347
Scott: It's not worth it.

635
00:42:28,871 --> 00:42:35,248
Rym: But this isn't really the interesting stuff because if you work for a company that's big enough They're just gonna set this up.

636
00:42:35,791 --> 00:42:49,227
Rym: The side effect is a lot of times there'll be a system that doesn't integrate that well with that single sign-on Like proprietary application like you can't tell steam to use your Active Directory server to log someone on right

637
00:42:49,387 --> 00:42:56,250
Scott: or even if you could Like a lot of times you just don't Yeah, right It's like, you know maybe you've got a system where it's like.

638
00:42:56,310 --> 00:43:07,046
Scott: You know, if all if you're if you're talking about this sort of thing where it's your internal employees logging in at a company Suddenly you get a system and it's like hey, well this system also has outside people logging into it.

639
00:43:07,628 --> 00:43:10,658
Rym: Yeah Yeah, I've been in this situation.

640
00:43:10,678 --> 00:43:13,587
Scott: This system is a proprietary is an application that we bought.

641
00:43:13,647 --> 00:43:19,090
Scott: maybe you got Maybe you got Adobe accounts for everybody creative cloud accounts.

642
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:22,770
Scott: Well, you can't really have creative cloud logins work with Microsoft.

643
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:27,520
Rym: Or oh my company bought another company and now there's like four domains.

644
00:43:27,601 --> 00:43:30,668
Rym: which domain am I logging into for which application?

645
00:43:30,849 --> 00:43:31,330
Scott: Oh, no

646
00:43:32,411 --> 00:43:50,310
Rym: So but all these concerns are primarily just like IT Sys admin network admin concerns inside of a big company and the way you solve a lot of those problems is Good operational procedures and like having someone write code and using services to like integrate single sign-on together.

647
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:56,992
Scott: Yep, if you're if you're an employee at a company who's not the IT person then as all you're gonna You're not.

648
00:43:57,012 --> 00:44:06,897
Scott: even if you don't even aware you might just think think it's natural that oh I need a different username and password for everything or it's natural I use the same username and password for all the things Right and like.

649
00:44:06,917 --> 00:44:09,310
Scott: you might not know that there could be a better or a worse world.

650
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:13,250
Scott: You're just used to what you have and it's not your job to do anything about it either.

651
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:16,964
Scott: So if you're an IT person, well, then you need to know about these things.

652
00:44:17,005 --> 00:44:18,370
Scott: Hopefully you'd set them up properly.

653
00:44:19,611 --> 00:44:20,013
Scott: Good job.

654
00:44:20,455 --> 00:44:24,330
Rym: so - well two things that have changed that make this a little more interesting conversation.

655
00:44:24,431 --> 00:44:26,426
Rym: That's the kind of I'm sort of outside of the enterprise now.

656
00:44:26,486 --> 00:44:26,950
Rym: Is that one?

657
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:30,530
Rym: The web has a lot of things on it now.

658
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:41,712
Rym: Oh, yeah, and two even inside enterprises in the old days You'd need a computer that runs like some specialized software to do one part of your job and like a specialized service that you've paid Money for.

659
00:44:42,135 --> 00:44:46,916
Rym: nowadays a lot of these things are also just web Pages or mobile apps.

660
00:44:46,976 --> 00:44:47,257
Rym: Yep.

661
00:44:47,377 --> 00:44:48,902
Rym: Go to a web page in your company.

662
00:44:49,182 --> 00:44:50,908
Rym: And that's the thing that lets you do your job.

663
00:44:51,429 --> 00:45:01,570
Rym: So Web single sign-on and web service single sign-on is probably the most important area We could talk about the most common and the most relevant to what happened at Facebook, right?

664
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:05,689
Scott: so the first kind of web single sign-on there was was sort of like the.

665
00:45:06,613 --> 00:45:11,250
Scott: You know your company has an exchange server setup, but there's a web gateway.

666
00:45:11,511 --> 00:45:14,810
Scott: Yeah, so you go to the website for exchange or Oracle or something?

667
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:26,350
Scott: But then you use your company login to get in even though it's a web page But it's like an internal your company web page like webmail dot your company dot com Yeah, and you got a VPN before you can browse to it or something like that, right?

668
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:28,296
Scott: So those aren't really any different.

669
00:45:28,577 --> 00:45:34,285
Scott: the next thing that happened that no one remembers which is still sort of a thing But you won't know it like you back in the day.

670
00:45:34,305 --> 00:45:34,869
Scott: You had to know it.

671
00:45:34,909 --> 00:45:38,309
Scott: now You don't even though it might still be underground somewhere is open ID.

672
00:45:39,093 --> 00:45:42,869
Rym: So Oh bag, I have an open ID account tied to my old YubiKey.

673
00:45:42,929 --> 00:45:45,909
Scott: still I mean your Google account is an open ID, but yeah.

674
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:51,350
Rym: But in the early days you had to find like a company that was selling open ID service, right?

675
00:45:51,751 --> 00:45:59,822
Scott: so what happened was is there were all these you'd go to all these different websites and make all these different accounts and People said let's solve this we'll make open ID servers.

676
00:45:59,863 --> 00:46:14,383
Scott: you make an account on the open ID server Then you go to a web page and instead of making a new account there You just say hey give me a new account This is my open ID and then the web page their server say geocities.

677
00:46:14,945 --> 00:46:19,997
Scott: I don't think geocities ever supported open ID Example like in that era.

678
00:46:20,037 --> 00:46:21,625
Rym: almost nothing supported open ID.

679
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:25,137
Rym: so I had one and I could only use Using geocities example.

680
00:46:25,197 --> 00:46:28,190
Scott: Yeah, but geocities you would go there say I want a new account.

681
00:46:28,591 --> 00:46:33,390
Scott: The geocities server would then talk to your open ID server your open ID server.

682
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:45,396
Scott: You would then go to it and log in and prove that you could log in and then there'd be sort of this triangle form Right between you the website you want to make an account on and your open ID Server and they would all.

683
00:46:45,416 --> 00:46:52,800
Scott: and now you would be the login to the new site with your open ID cookie Whatever basically a delegation of the credential.

684
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:58,516
Rym: So you're saying this other guy has The credential to prove that I'm me.

685
00:46:58,577 --> 00:47:00,001
Rym: so trust that credential.

686
00:47:00,503 --> 00:47:02,590
Rym: trust him that I'm me, right?

687
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:05,803
Scott: So that was only a few nerds used it because it was hard to do.

688
00:47:05,843 --> 00:47:12,566
Scott: you had not yet like type in a. you had Get a server make an account on it then tell the website you were registering an account on.

689
00:47:12,947 --> 00:47:13,790
Scott: use this server.

690
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:24,982
Scott: This is my open ID account and here I'm logged in and you know, it's not what many places supported it but what eventually happened is the thing that you are using today without even realizing it.

691
00:47:25,463 --> 00:47:29,257
Scott: is they invented based on that same exact Triangle model.

692
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,738
Scott: right they invented Oh off Right and Oh off is what's used.

693
00:47:33,778 --> 00:47:40,319
Scott: when you says sign in with Google sign in with Facebook sign in with Twitter That's all the same exact triangle shaped model.

694
00:47:40,781 --> 00:47:42,706
Scott: you log into Google, right?

695
00:47:42,787 --> 00:47:46,462
Scott: Then you go and tell Geocities that you know what?

696
00:47:46,602 --> 00:47:47,186
Scott: I don't want to make it.

697
00:47:47,287 --> 00:47:47,689
Scott: use it easy.

698
00:47:48,691 --> 00:47:49,575
Scott: username and password.

699
00:47:50,057 --> 00:47:51,243
Scott: this is my Google account.

700
00:47:51,705 --> 00:47:52,569
Scott: talk to Google.

701
00:47:52,589 --> 00:47:56,829
Scott: if If you see someone logged in as me, then that's me.

702
00:47:57,272 --> 00:47:59,949
Scott: Associate me with this account and it works and you've used it.

703
00:48:00,371 --> 00:48:03,482
Rym: So post web 2.0 like in the early days of the internet.

704
00:48:03,502 --> 00:48:09,062
Rym: There are very few websites you would log into Like there weren't many things where you needed an account.

705
00:48:09,222 --> 00:48:10,768
Rym: Yep, and you just had a separate account.

706
00:48:10,788 --> 00:48:13,295
Rym: all these websites But now we both have.

707
00:48:13,817 --> 00:48:25,076
Rym: like most of the things people do online are with services that require accounts these days yep, and the web pages are basically just like apps to let people do the thing and This is mainstream.

708
00:48:25,096 --> 00:48:28,050
Rym: So normal people there is no way on earth.

709
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:31,344
Rym: They will be able to remember a hundred logins to a hundred different.

710
00:48:31,364 --> 00:48:32,890
Scott: so they use the same login everywhere.

711
00:48:33,234 --> 00:48:34,730
Scott: I'll come when you get their password.

712
00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:39,265
Scott: You can then log into all their stuff and they say they got hacked when really they're very simple.

713
00:48:39,305 --> 00:48:41,802
Scott: password was merely guessed by A family member who knows them.

714
00:48:41,822 --> 00:48:42,489
Scott: Well, yep.

715
00:48:43,152 --> 00:48:45,639
Rym: So nowadays like I do this Scott does this.

716
00:48:45,659 --> 00:48:46,241
Rym: we all do this.

717
00:48:46,301 --> 00:48:48,127
Rym: the people who got burned by Facebook do this.

718
00:48:48,749 --> 00:48:48,989
Rym: you.

719
00:48:49,029 --> 00:48:58,474
Rym: there you can use services that most people have like Facebook and Google as a de facto Identity store.

720
00:48:58,674 --> 00:49:03,710
Rym: like you can use them as the way to prove who you are to anyone else on the internet.

721
00:49:04,534 --> 00:49:07,290
Rym: So my Google account is like my main account for everything.

722
00:49:07,631 --> 00:49:15,136
Rym: So it makes sense to use that to prove who I am literally everywhere else I go and because Google is big enough Most people will support that.

723
00:49:15,617 --> 00:49:16,119
Rym: but note.

724
00:49:16,741 --> 00:49:22,350
Rym: This is all still just private profit based companies Providing this for their own purposes.

725
00:49:22,691 --> 00:49:24,496
Scott: There's also another level to OAuth.

726
00:49:24,516 --> 00:49:25,298
Scott: right because OAuth?

727
00:49:25,378 --> 00:49:32,649
Scott: on the one hand this triangle shaped architecture is used to you know Log into a different website using the credentials from another one.

728
00:49:33,091 --> 00:49:39,672
Scott: But actually what it's used for is you ever go to like Twitter and it says you've given these websites permission to do stuff on Twitter.

729
00:49:40,094 --> 00:49:42,304
Scott: right you go and you say, okay.

730
00:49:42,385 --> 00:49:46,980
Scott: I'll give you know Flickr permission to access my Twitter account.

731
00:49:47,422 --> 00:49:49,410
Scott: right that same triangle happens.

732
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:58,290
Scott: But now when you upload a photo on Flickr Flickr will auto tweet and do stuff on Twitter as you For you, even though you didn't do it yourself.

733
00:49:58,811 --> 00:50:05,087
Scott: You gave this sort of permission for Flickr right to do that thing with Twitter on your behalf.

734
00:50:05,147 --> 00:50:08,890
Scott: That's also an OAuth Thing but that's the important thing.

735
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:25,170
Rym: So you have you have authorized like there's a permissioning system built into most uses of OAuth for you to say you can separate this Application is using my account versus this application versus this application Independent of the credential you personally use to log in manually.

736
00:50:25,391 --> 00:50:29,063
Rym: Yeah, so if one of those things has a problem where gets compromised you can cut it off.

737
00:50:29,103 --> 00:50:33,563
Scott: Yeah, but architecturally speaking You know it's the same triangle shape.

738
00:50:33,603 --> 00:50:42,705
Scott: It's the same OAuth You know thing that's happening the same program the same standards Of the way the tokens and the cryptography is done and everything to do.

739
00:50:42,765 --> 00:50:45,255
Scott: all these the same functions Right, you know.

740
00:50:45,316 --> 00:51:01,471
Scott: and most when it's when it's developed in a in a good way You'll be able to log in to say your Twitter account Twitter does it in a good way and you can go and there's a web Page and on Twitter and your profile that lists all the apps you gave permission to access your Twitter account and what permissions you gave Them.

741
00:51:01,512 --> 00:51:09,550
Scott: it's like oh I gave this one permission to let me log in with Twitter But I didn't let it read my tweets or tweet as me or any of that of the stuff, right?

742
00:51:09,872 --> 00:51:12,170
Scott: It's like oh no, but I gave this photo site.

743
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:16,486
Scott: I gave them permission to tweet as me and read all my tweets and edit my profile and edit my avatar.

744
00:51:16,527 --> 00:51:19,850
Scott: and you know Let me log into Twitter and all this other stuff.

745
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:28,321
Rym: So while this is deeply important to the way the web is used today and like we don't want to go back to an era Without this kind of like federated authentication.

746
00:51:28,421 --> 00:51:30,910
Rym: Oh, yeah, but at the same time it's opened up.

747
00:51:30,970 --> 00:51:36,490
Scott: I mean without this we wouldn't be able to have the GeekNights website automatically tweet when we post a new episode.

748
00:51:36,751 --> 00:51:42,430
Rym: Yep, or if we did there'd be like a script somewhere that has our plain text password stored, right?

749
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:47,610
Scott: Yeah, even if someone hacks the GeekNights server, you won't be able to hack into the GeekNights' account.

750
00:51:47,972 --> 00:51:50,990
Scott: You'll just have these keys that are OAuth keys that can be used.

751
00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:54,927
Scott: You might be able to tweet as GeekNights But then I'll be won't be able to log in.

752
00:51:55,370 --> 00:52:02,415
Scott: So I'll log in and I'll just remove that permission and make new keys and after I fix the service you can't get in there Right, and then that's that.

753
00:52:02,596 --> 00:52:16,410
Rym: but the negative is the actual details of how these credentials are authenticated Like how the tokens are passed and how a session is maintained and torn down and all that kind of stuff is very complex And there's a lot of room to fuck it up, right?

754
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:22,370
Scott: A lot of people implement things wrongly and they send keys on the wrong portion of the triangle.

755
00:52:23,330 --> 00:52:24,073
Scott: Allowing.

756
00:52:24,153 --> 00:52:29,335
Scott: that's usually the number one mistake is sending keys the wrong way so that someone sees a key They shouldn't see.

757
00:52:29,355 --> 00:52:37,370
Scott: yeah, right like for example The triangle method architecture is also used when you say buy something with PayPal, right?

758
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:40,310
Scott: So you go to a website and you're at you're at e-store.

759
00:52:40,430 --> 00:52:46,090
Scott: So you've got you got Scott and we got in the e-shop where we're buying stuff and I gotta buy some of PayPal.

760
00:52:46,210 --> 00:52:50,950
Scott: So those are the three pieces of the triangle you the customer PayPal and the store, right?

761
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:53,997
Scott: You talk to the store and say you want to buy something.

762
00:52:54,378 --> 00:53:07,458
Scott: you then go they set then go to PayPal and create like this transaction and then you go to PayPal and do all the buying with PayPal and all that PayPal sends to the store is Yes, that person paid.

763
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:08,965
Scott: they don't tell them anything else.

764
00:53:08,985 --> 00:53:10,574
Scott: They don't tell them your credit card They don't tell them.

765
00:53:10,594 --> 00:53:16,610
Scott: All right, as PayPal is implemented properly Secure for whatever other criticisms you have a PayPal.

766
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:17,291
Scott: It's.

767
00:53:17,692 --> 00:53:22,250
Scott: they implemented taking a lot their technology of purchasing things correctly at least as far as we can tell.

768
00:53:22,592 --> 00:53:23,378
Scott: Yeah, no, it's.

769
00:53:23,519 --> 00:53:29,270
Scott: I've done a lot of PayPal API At least from the the e-shop side anyway.

770
00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:39,708
Scott: but and then you go back to the website with the store and the store recognizes that you're that person and it recognizes that you Paid and then it says congratulations you we're gonna send you this product, right?

771
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:44,170
Scott: If you fuck this up Right, if you're the person making the e-shop.

772
00:53:44,651 --> 00:53:56,070
Scott: You might say send a customer some of those tokens that you were sharing with PayPal and now your customer can now see all these PayPal things that happen with your account because you've sent them a thing you shouldn't have sent them

773
00:53:56,330 --> 00:53:58,035
Rym: And this is a general understand

774
00:53:58,075 --> 00:53:58,757
Scott: what was going on.

775
00:53:58,858 --> 00:53:59,820
Rym: This is a general concern.

776
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:03,110
Rym: in API's people very easily will send metadata.

777
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:10,850
Rym: They shouldn't either because they're not paying attention or they don't understand what that metadata could be used for by nefarious actor.

778
00:54:11,137 --> 00:54:12,517
Scott: I guess you know They could use like.

779
00:54:12,598 --> 00:54:17,383
Scott: I guess if I had your PayPal keys I could like start charging people money and the money would go to you.

780
00:54:17,403 --> 00:54:21,050
Scott: I Could open up a store where you get all the money.

781
00:54:23,033 --> 00:54:26,030
Rym: This opens up is people don't read things.

782
00:54:26,371 --> 00:54:38,963
Rym: So now you'll have applications like especially phone apps but also websites and things that'll say hey click on this so we can tweet and it'll ask for like Full access to your Twitter and a lot of people just say yes.

783
00:54:39,284 --> 00:54:40,087
Scott: Yeah, and then they go.

784
00:54:40,107 --> 00:54:40,950
Scott: my Twitter was hacked.

785
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:41,793
Scott: It's like no.

786
00:54:42,013 --> 00:54:48,801
Rym: you gave some shady spam website permission to tweet as the vampire knocked on the door and asked if it could come In and you said yes, please.

787
00:54:49,023 --> 00:55:04,365
Rym: and then it bit you Yep, it threw out the garlic ahead of permission, but at the same time the other vulnerability is that you've basically Delegated this trust such that there's one single point of authentication.

788
00:55:04,385 --> 00:55:05,409
Rym: So in my case Google.

789
00:55:05,429 --> 00:55:07,753
Rym: if Google fucks up.

790
00:55:08,375 --> 00:55:11,584
Rym: I am royally effed because Google will.

791
00:55:11,644 --> 00:55:17,462
Rym: if anyone compromises my Google account They can get into almost every account I have everywhere.

792
00:55:17,682 --> 00:55:20,250
Scott: Yeah, pretty much the Google cause we use Gmail, right?

793
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:25,730
Scott: Google account is the linchpin because pretty much if you have my email you can recover almost anything.

794
00:55:26,273 --> 00:55:32,110
Scott: Right you is there might be some two-factor stuff You might not be able to get but almost everything else that's good.

795
00:55:32,210 --> 00:55:33,756
Scott: It's gonna be relatively easy for you.

796
00:55:33,776 --> 00:55:34,258
Scott: like even some.

797
00:55:34,338 --> 00:55:35,783
Scott: I forgot my password.

798
00:55:35,864 --> 00:55:44,613
Rym: recover go to the email Yeah, but even then like it with the single sign on I'll go to some website and it says oh you're already authenticated I know this cookie.

799
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:45,015
Rym: You're good.

800
00:55:45,235 --> 00:55:45,476
Scott: Yep.

801
00:55:45,536 --> 00:55:45,958
Scott: You're good.

802
00:55:46,239 --> 00:55:46,700
Scott: It happens.

803
00:55:46,981 --> 00:55:49,028
Rym: Yeah, it happened with Facebook.

804
00:55:49,309 --> 00:55:50,666
Scott: it did so.

805
00:55:52,191 --> 00:55:58,010
Scott: So another problem with single sign-on right is that not only do you have the single point of failure where if somebody were to?

806
00:55:58,210 --> 00:55:58,812
Scott: Say access it.

807
00:55:58,832 --> 00:56:00,458
Scott: They can now log into right.

808
00:56:00,578 --> 00:56:04,090
Scott: It's like oh if you have separate sign-ons and someone busts open one system.

809
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:08,930
Scott: Well, okay, you busted open one system, but if you bust open a single sign-on system, guess what now?

810
00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:11,760
Scott: You've got access to all the systems in the company, right?

811
00:56:11,881 --> 00:56:14,270
Scott: If you get users credentials, you can now log in anywhere.

812
00:56:14,613 --> 00:56:21,730
Scott: You don't need to guess 10 passwords to 10 system One password for 10 systems, but also if you're say active directory it goes down.

813
00:56:22,092 --> 00:56:23,261
Scott: No one can log into anything.

814
00:56:23,281 --> 00:56:24,289
Scott: your whole company is down.

815
00:56:25,491 --> 00:56:26,556
Rym: Only people mess up.

816
00:56:26,596 --> 00:56:29,790
Scott: because I'm just saying if you have a single you have a single point of failure.

817
00:56:30,031 --> 00:56:35,110
Scott: You think they make you have two servers if you set it back to directory, but the plan also credential caching, right?

818
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:39,747
Scott: But say if you you know, you log in with Google for everything and Google goes down.

819
00:56:39,767 --> 00:56:44,162
Scott: now You can't log into anything until Google's back up.

820
00:56:44,423 --> 00:56:49,890
Rym: It is a possibility and credential caching Only gets you so far and also opens you up to vulnerabilities potentially, right?

821
00:56:49,970 --> 00:57:02,490
Scott: But you get the idea is that you when you create this convenience of being able to log in everywhere with one Credential even though it's only one system with one password You're not doing the wrong thing of put of putting one password on many systems.

822
00:57:02,891 --> 00:57:14,470
Scott: But you are you know being it's like I'm shut out of everything because the single sign-on Authentication server is down or oh no someone cannot access all these things because they got guessed one password.

823
00:57:14,691 --> 00:57:23,930
Rym: yep, now so the important parts of this like if you ever in a position where you have to set this stuff up or Manage it is don't cut corners on implementing the API's.

824
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:27,401
Rym: Yeah, like if there's a standard follow it.

825
00:57:27,703 --> 00:57:31,314
Scott: use the very very popular Systems, right?

826
00:57:31,375 --> 00:57:31,856
Scott: Don't you?

827
00:57:31,936 --> 00:57:35,565
Scott: don't write your own thing, you know, don't make some custom thing.

828
00:57:36,007 --> 00:57:37,290
Scott: use the existing stuff.

829
00:57:37,430 --> 00:57:42,110
Scott: Yeah, set things up with the default, you know permissions and every right the default configurations.

830
00:57:42,472 --> 00:57:44,301
Scott: Don't go messing around right.

831
00:57:44,321 --> 00:57:56,950
Rym: do it the way it's supposed to be done and wave whatever you're implementing build a very robust auditing and Authentication like management and security management and permission management system like an authorization system.

832
00:57:57,533 --> 00:58:05,449
Rym: You need to have that locked down and set up right to let people Troubleshoot if something goes wrong and something gets hacked which Facebook might not have done.

833
00:58:06,252 --> 00:58:13,623
Scott: So for example, like if you're adding PayPal to your website, you'll see you'll notice that when you go to PayPal's documentation They've got like multiple different tiers of like.

834
00:58:13,643 --> 00:58:14,870
Scott: how good are you at technology?

835
00:58:15,491 --> 00:58:23,329
Scott: Right and the first tier is like literally copy and paste this code into your page It'll make a button that lets people buy stuff that use that.

836
00:58:24,092 --> 00:58:34,705
Scott: Don't don't go messing around with the higher levels of actually use using the PayPal API Unless you're super super confident that you understand absolutely everything that it's got.

837
00:58:34,745 --> 00:58:36,410
Scott: this that's talking about, right?

838
00:58:36,810 --> 00:58:40,270
Scott: It's like you should use one level dumber than you feel you could get away with.

839
00:58:40,310 --> 00:58:46,873
Scott: It's like you might be able to successfully implement that PayPal API, but don't Right don't.

840
00:58:46,953 --> 00:58:51,590
Scott: unless you are like a hundred percent understanding absolutely everything, right?

841
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:59,244
Scott: If you feel like you could use the the even more difficult one now go back one level lower Right, don't don't use the level you can do.

842
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:00,712
Scott: Yeah one level easier now at least.

843
00:59:00,792 --> 00:59:11,848
Rym: one good thing though is that there was an era with Facebook where this started to pick up where a lot of Schools and like place it like government things or places where people have no choice but to interact.

844
00:59:12,149 --> 00:59:14,200
Rym: we're requiring single sign-on.

845
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:18,928
Rym: they wouldn't let you make your own account and They'd only let you make an account with Facebook.

846
00:59:19,830 --> 00:59:41,589
Rym: Luckily, we're kind of past that now and most major services will let you choose from a variety Usually Google Facebook and maybe one or two other common services people use and you pick which one you want to use as your primary Identity which I think is a good thing because there is no way there will be a like government-sponsored standard open ID ID anytime soon.

847
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:50,120
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

848
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:54,920
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

849
00:59:55,241 --> 00:59:57,208
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at front row.

850
00:59:57,248 --> 01:00:00,260
Scott: crew comm for show notes discussion news and more.

851
01:00:00,541 --> 01:00:07,983
Rym: Remember GeekNights is not one but four different shows sci-tech Mondays gaming Tuesdays anime comic Wednesdays and indiscriminate Thursdays.

Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

854
01:00:16,014 --> 01:00:38,237
Rym: But unlike those other late shows It's actually recorded at night and the patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights are despite my sniffling Craig Oliver Allen Joyce, Heidi McNicholas shimmering groovy obelisk hanging in the sky kashar tovish in my state.

857
01:01:13,206 --> 01:01:19,939
Rym: so I'm just gonna leave you with something and I'm shocked that there are people I know who didn't know what this was.

858
01:01:20,502 --> 01:01:23,376
Rym: So we're hoping that it might make a comeback in the near future.

859
01:01:23,396 --> 01:01:24,120
Rym: So stay tuned.
