00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,192
Rym: It's Thursday March 23rd, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:13,252 --> 00:00:15,800
Rym: We talk about South Park and Futurama.

3
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:23,200
Rym: Let's do this so as you all may have noticed the hosting is down or was down for several hours today at least.

4
00:00:24,061 --> 00:00:26,448
Scott: Yeah, it's so pleasant when this happens.

5
00:00:26,588 --> 00:00:28,554
Scott: You know it just makes my life terrific.

6
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:30,500
Rym: Yeah, well it has nothing to do with me.

7
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,866
Rym: It's all Scott at the hosting.

8
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:34,338
Rym: so if you have complaints send them to him where he'll ignore you.

9
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:37,410
Scott: Yep, and I'm working on it.

10
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:39,838
Scott: You know I noticed before anyone else noticed.

11
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:43,730
Scott: so No amount of yelling at me is gonna make it fix sooner.

12
00:00:44,212 --> 00:00:46,138
Rym: damn it Scott fix it.

13
00:00:46,198 --> 00:00:46,499
Scott: You know what.

14
00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:50,085
Rym: now I'm gonna go slower all right that hurts You just as much as it hurts me.

15
00:00:50,386 --> 00:00:52,152
Rym: cuz your blog and everything's up there, too.

16
00:00:52,493 --> 00:00:54,500
Scott: I don't care so people won't miss it.

17
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,103
Scott: It's not like.

18
00:00:55,405 --> 00:00:56,390
Scott: it's the end of the world.

19
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,340
Scott: Scott's blog isn't online.

20
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,643
Scott: Podcast website isn't there Mmm.

21
00:01:03,241 --> 00:01:05,874
Rym: Anyway, you had some things you wanted to say before I started with the news.

22
00:01:06,336 --> 00:01:09,239
Scott: Oh, yeah all week I've been trying to remember to tell everyone about.

23
00:01:10,205 --> 00:01:15,875
Scott: We got the frapper map Frapper comm slash front row crew where you put a little pushpin on the map to say where you are.

24
00:01:16,316 --> 00:01:19,476
Scott: so you know It'd be cool if everyone did that.

25
00:01:20,601 --> 00:01:26,791
Scott: also, we have a separate feed for each day now and When the blog comes back up you can go to front row.

26
00:01:26,812 --> 00:01:38,418
Scott: crew calm and there's a little how-to With links to all the separate feeds and the links of separate feeds are on the right side of the page in Case you only want to subscribe to maybe just Thursday or just Monday or something.

27
00:01:38,739 --> 00:01:41,895
Rym: yeah Even though I'd recommend that you subscribe to all days for various reasons.

28
00:01:42,217 --> 00:01:48,640
Scott: yep The forum is there when the site comes back up which everyone should join and have a lot of fun talking in.

29
00:01:49,282 --> 00:01:53,815
Rym: Yeah, even though we just started a fairly awesome thread that got killed by the fact that the forums currently down.

30
00:01:54,016 --> 00:01:55,340
Scott: Yeah, it's just terrific.

31
00:01:55,641 --> 00:01:58,333
Rym: Yeah, and thanks to all you people who keep messaging me telling me.

32
00:01:58,373 --> 00:01:58,835
Rym: It's down.

33
00:01:58,915 --> 00:01:59,237
Rym: I know.

34
00:01:59,257 --> 00:02:00,402
Rym: yeah I know.

35
00:02:00,643 --> 00:02:03,820
Scott: of course you won't hear this until much later when it comes back up.

36
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:17,639
Rym: Well actually you can't hear it until it comes back up because unless I make my own RSS feed on Libsyn There's no way for us to put the episode up even though Putting the episode up has nothing to do with the site other than the fact that WordPress makes the RSS.

37
00:02:18,241 --> 00:02:22,716
Scott: Yeah, couldn't we just like go tell feed burner to add a link or something?

38
00:02:22,736 --> 00:02:25,686
Rym: no No damn.

39
00:02:26,107 --> 00:02:26,790
Scott: oh well whatever.

40
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:32,499
Rym: I might make a backup RSS feed on Libsyn Just so I'll be able to put up episodes even if the hosting goes down.

41
00:02:33,122 --> 00:02:34,005
Scott: There might be a good idea.

42
00:02:34,126 --> 00:02:37,961
Rym: so then the only people who are fucked are the people who don't subscribe and just go to the Site.

43
00:02:38,081 --> 00:02:46,670
Scott: actually the only people who are complaining right now are people who use the forum right yeah And people who actually visit the website which is a small percentage.

44
00:02:46,831 --> 00:02:50,423
Rym: and all the people on our jabber server who got pissy after jabbers Working that.

45
00:02:50,464 --> 00:02:52,375
Rym: yeah, it's working now, but it went down and knocked them all off.

46
00:02:52,596 --> 00:02:53,059
Scott: Yeah, it did.

47
00:02:55,604 --> 00:03:01,680
Rym: But in the news Nintendo made two very very interesting and happy announcements at GDC.

48
00:03:02,344 --> 00:03:07,039
Scott: Yep, the first one is Zelda dm the phantom hourglass.

49
00:03:08,642 --> 00:03:11,853
Scott: It's always the something something you know well.

50
00:03:11,873 --> 00:03:13,700
Rym: the first one was just the legend of Zelda.

51
00:03:14,142 --> 00:03:15,589
Rym: Then it was the legend of Zelda's.

52
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:17,498
Rym: oh yeah the adventure of link mm-hmm.

53
00:03:18,564 --> 00:03:23,226
Scott: So yeah, they always add something Better of time.

54
00:03:23,246 --> 00:03:24,148
Scott: you know.

55
00:03:24,168 --> 00:03:27,197
Scott: it's always some object and then the object has some power.

56
00:03:27,438 --> 00:03:28,260
Rym: uh Minish cat.

57
00:03:29,402 --> 00:03:31,318
Scott: Yeah, it was a hat and it was Minish.

58
00:03:32,881 --> 00:03:34,227
Rym: Word doesn't mean anything.

59
00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:35,453
Scott: It was a made-up word.

60
00:03:35,473 --> 00:03:40,373
Scott: It doesn't matter the wind waker It was this wand that wake the wind you know?

61
00:03:40,413 --> 00:03:42,260
Rym: yeah, anyway this game looks.

62
00:03:42,421 --> 00:03:44,797
Rym: I mean you can download a trailer preview II thing.

63
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:46,707
Scott: yeah There's a video floating around the night.

64
00:03:46,728 --> 00:03:48,256
Scott: you can go look at if you want to.

65
00:03:48,658 --> 00:03:49,120
Rym: I'm excited.

66
00:03:49,241 --> 00:03:53,278
Rym: I just hope this game is good unlike the Minish cap which was disappointing to say the best.

67
00:03:53,619 --> 00:04:02,740
Scott: yeah It looks like it's some sort of in between 3d 2d kind of game But mostly it's in the style of the awesome portable Zelda games.

68
00:04:03,302 --> 00:04:09,619
Scott: but there's some stylus type puzzles going on in a few of the rooms and It looks generally awesome.

69
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:17,254
Rym: I'm also really hoping and I really I'm reasonably certain that there will be some sort of cool Wireless multiplayer even if it's not a full-on game.

70
00:04:17,334 --> 00:04:18,200
Rym: I can imagine something.

71
00:04:18,882 --> 00:04:20,954
Scott: They really just put four swords DS out.

72
00:04:21,497 --> 00:04:22,120
Rym: Yeah, that'd be fantastic.

73
00:04:22,281 --> 00:04:27,080
Rym: I know they keep saying that Crystal Chronicles DS is gonna come out, but yeah, we'll see about that.

74
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,786
Rym: Yeah, it's still at the bottom of game.

75
00:04:28,806 --> 00:04:32,077
Rym: facts on the announced, but no date list.

76
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:32,740
Scott: great.

77
00:04:34,521 --> 00:04:40,701
Scott: The other announcement is that the revolution we all know it's gonna have some old-school Nintendo games for you to download and emulate and all That.

78
00:04:40,802 --> 00:04:42,592
Scott: yep, NES SNES now.

79
00:04:42,672 --> 00:04:43,396
Scott: It's gonna have.

80
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:47,478
Scott: officially There's gonna be some Genesis and some turbo graphics games.

81
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:54,133
Rym: now They said that it's not gonna be every game But I think the words they used war were a best of compilation.

82
00:04:54,654 --> 00:04:56,540
Scott: so bonks adventures a guarantee.

83
00:04:56,801 --> 00:05:01,659
Rym: Yep, maybe the original turbo graphics 16 Bomberman or our type.

84
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:08,317
Scott: This turbo graphics 16 is pretty much just an R-type machine as far you know and there's a cool racing game.

85
00:05:08,337 --> 00:05:09,360
Scott: I forget the name of.

86
00:05:10,062 --> 00:05:11,970
Rym: Yeah, there's a bunch of cool racing games actually.

Rym: yeah beach volleyball wasn't that bad?

88
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:17,976
Scott: Yeah, there's a really good volleyball for the NES Super Spike V ball.

89
00:05:17,996 --> 00:05:22,361
Rym: yep Actually, I got a guy at work who has a turbo graphics 16.

90
00:05:22,361 --> 00:05:24,473
Rym: It's the most modern gaming console.

91
00:05:24,493 --> 00:05:26,551
Rym: He owns other than the DS He bought for his daughters.

92
00:05:27,017 --> 00:05:29,770
Rym: well I went over there and played some awesome racing game.

93
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:33,706
Scott: if I like how the games for the turbo graphics It's you know like these little plastic cards.

94
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:37,076
Rym: Yeah, and how a lot of them are five player.

95
00:05:37,096 --> 00:05:38,400
Scott: Yeah, that's crazy.

96
00:05:38,701 --> 00:05:39,424
Rym: Yeah, what the hell?

97
00:05:39,444 --> 00:05:41,853
Rym: I mean, it's it's not for like every other game system ever.

98
00:05:41,893 --> 00:05:43,500
Rym: I mean the Atari was even for player.

99
00:05:45,383 --> 00:05:48,320
Scott: Yep, I don't get it, but whatever turbo graphics 16 is cool.

100
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:48,642
Scott: I like how.

101
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,090
Scott: I had a turbo on the controllers.

102
00:05:50,151 --> 00:05:53,356
Rym: that was something else - yep You couldn't call it cheating if it came with it.

103
00:05:54,422 --> 00:05:57,732
Scott: You know what I remember about the turbo graphics 16 is a long time ago.

104
00:05:57,772 --> 00:06:12,319
Scott: when it came out the mall had like this event like they came to the mall with like a million kiosks of Turbo graphics 16 machines and filled the hallways and handed out videotapes so that would like demonstrate the software to you and all this sorts of crazy stuff.

105
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:21,946
Scott: and like I didn't even never heard of this thing before until I went to the mall and saw it and then after that No one ever bought one.

106
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:24,820
Scott: We just it was just this thing that happened at the mall one day.

107
00:06:25,081 --> 00:06:26,431
Scott: Yeah, it wasn't.

108
00:06:26,491 --> 00:06:27,800
Scott: you know if it was like a new Nintendo?

109
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,470
Rym: I never knew anyone back in the Nintendo days who had one.

110
00:06:31,032 --> 00:06:38,678
Scott: the only people I knew had one were like my rich Distant cousins and I went to their mansion once and played it and that was that.

111
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,058
Rym: now We did have a friend who had a neo geo.

112
00:06:42,161 --> 00:06:43,104
Scott: Neo geos are cool.

113
00:06:43,446 --> 00:06:47,300
Scott: Yeah, but they're really only cool if you're in Japan where they have all the neo geo arcade machine.

114
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:53,340
Rym: I just remember when the kid was telling me how much each game cost and I remember wanting to just cry because I wasn't rich.

115
00:06:54,124 --> 00:06:58,920
Scott: Yeah The whole point of the neo geo was supposed to combine the arcade in the home experience.

116
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:06,200
Scott: So like you would go home and practice king of fighters And then you would go to the arcade with your memory card and play king of fighters against people.

117
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,687
Scott: That was the point of the neo geo.

118
00:07:07,788 --> 00:07:10,120
Rym: Yeah, the problem was it was hellishly expensive.

119
00:07:10,865 --> 00:07:11,147
Scott: Yep.

120
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:11,831
Scott: Yep.

121
00:07:11,872 --> 00:07:12,033
Scott: Yep.

122
00:07:12,053 --> 00:07:12,254
Scott: Yep.

123
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:22,520
Rym: Oh Yeah, but in actual as in non video game news Internet Explorer has another horrible critical rootkit security hole.

124
00:07:23,562 --> 00:07:25,219
Rym: Great it's unpatchable.

125
00:07:25,702 --> 00:07:33,347
Rym: It appears in every version of Internet Explorer currently in use all the way up to and including The most recent beta of a ie7.

126
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:36,414
Scott: it really is in the eyes beta whatever.

127
00:07:36,555 --> 00:07:36,755
Rym: Yes.

128
00:07:36,836 --> 00:07:38,039
Rym: It's in beta 2 of ie7.

129
00:07:38,963 --> 00:07:40,052
Scott: That's like the newest.

130
00:07:40,315 --> 00:07:40,940
Scott: I can't believe it.

131
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,475
Scott: There's a bug that means that they didn't completely rewrite ie from scratch and they made beta 7.

132
00:07:45,475 --> 00:07:47,823
Scott: Yep Wow It's.

133
00:07:47,923 --> 00:07:48,887
Rym: it's a horrible bug.

134
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:59,640
Rym: Apparently it's been well known among script kiddies and leet hackers loser types for the last 40 or 50 days and Someone just discovered this in a forum where people were talking about exploits.

135
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,279
Rym: They've written using it and he posted it to some full disclosure list.

136
00:08:04,561 --> 00:08:07,360
Scott: Okay, so if you're still using Internet Explorer.

137
00:08:09,061 --> 00:08:09,925
Scott: What's wrong with you?

138
00:08:10,326 --> 00:08:10,688
Scott: You know what?

139
00:08:10,748 --> 00:08:15,398
Scott: No, if you're using an explorer and something happens to your computer You have no one to blame but yourself.

140
00:08:15,861 --> 00:08:16,946
Scott: Firefox is free.

141
00:08:16,966 --> 00:08:18,191
Scott: if Firefox wasn't free.

142
00:08:18,211 --> 00:08:19,959
Scott: You could have an excuse but no, it's free.

143
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:25,552
Scott: Yes Opera opera Mozilla and Firefox works in old shitty computers too.

144
00:08:25,955 --> 00:08:26,759
Scott: So what the hell?

145
00:08:28,321 --> 00:08:29,670
Scott: Everyone use Firefox damn it.

146
00:08:30,455 --> 00:08:31,200
Rym: Yeah or something?

147
00:08:32,282 --> 00:08:33,131
Scott: Yeah, come on.

148
00:08:33,172 --> 00:08:33,900
Scott: What the hell now?

149
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,539
Rym: I have it on good authority that Microsoft has known about this for at least a month and no patches come out.

150
00:08:39,578 --> 00:08:40,020
Rym: yet Let's cuz.

151
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:42,874
Scott: they only patch in like the second Tuesday of the month.

152
00:08:42,953 --> 00:08:44,380
Scott: It's always called black Tuesday.

153
00:08:44,561 --> 00:08:48,800
Rym: Yeah, except the last time something like this came out for ie they released that patch early.

154
00:08:50,002 --> 00:08:50,928
Scott: They really should if it.

155
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,720
Scott: how severe is this vulnerability?

156
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:56,100
Scott: Is it like I can move your computer and all you have to do is visit my website?

157
00:08:56,301 --> 00:09:00,559
Rym: I saw the three words that I always see and these are the words that always scare me when I see him.

158
00:09:00,579 --> 00:09:18,080
Rym: in any Sort of bug list remote code execution At administrator level or not The advisor guy read doesn't actually say if it can be if it's run as administrator or not But noting that 99% of all Windows users are always logged in as administrator.

159
00:09:19,261 --> 00:09:22,780
Rym: I'm fairly confident that it is a administrator remote code execution.

160
00:09:23,382 --> 00:09:32,168
Scott: Well, I'm also fairly confident that if you can remotely execute code at user level that there's some other exploits somewhere that you can take Advantage of to promote to administrator.

161
00:09:32,188 --> 00:09:38,510
Scott: Yeah, at least in Windows Linux is definitely better about that And Linux is pretty much no way you can promote to administrator.

162
00:09:38,571 --> 00:09:44,095
Scott: unless you grab a user who's like in the wheel group or something Yep, or you know anyone is a decent password.

163
00:09:44,115 --> 00:09:51,231
Rym: That's not gonna happen Yeah, or you know if you just socially engineer your way into root Yeah, that's really the best way to hack Linux.

164
00:09:51,251 --> 00:09:52,598
Rym: Just get to know some nerd who?

165
00:09:53,341 --> 00:09:56,193
Rym: Admins a Unix server out there and steal his password.

166
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:02,420
Scott: Oh The you know, there's other ways to hack Linux though, like wait for someone to use a really old version.

167
00:10:02,923 --> 00:10:03,810
Scott: Oh the hostings back up.

168
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:04,253
Scott: I fixed it.

169
00:10:04,515 --> 00:10:06,498
Rym: Haha Hooray, yeah.

170
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:12,040
Rym: So any of you who are smart out there can correlate the two and figure out exactly when we recorded this episode.

171
00:10:12,881 --> 00:10:14,891
Scott: How would they were figure out when we recorded the episode?

172
00:10:15,071 --> 00:10:16,860
Rym: because they could listen and then they'd know.

173
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:19,391
Rym: But we mentioned that the hosting just came back up.

174
00:10:19,431 --> 00:10:21,118
Rym: then they could look and see when the hosting came back up.

175
00:10:21,902 --> 00:10:23,248
Scott: How would they find out when it came back up?

176
00:10:23,268 --> 00:10:30,534
Rym: because they're obviously sitting there hitting f5 Every three seconds waiting desperately for GeekNights to come back because their life has no meaning without it.

177
00:10:31,396 --> 00:10:31,958
Scott: Oh GeekNights.

178
00:10:32,018 --> 00:10:32,720
Scott: Is that good?

179
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:39,154
Rym: Awesome, and the answer that riddle was 947 p.m Yeah, Eastern Standard Time.

180
00:10:39,235 --> 00:10:40,157
Scott: Oh, my clock says 945 must be off.

181
00:10:43,165 --> 00:10:44,679
Rym: Mine syncs up to the atomic clock.

182
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:46,626
Scott: Well, let this be a lesson to everyone.

183
00:10:47,027 --> 00:10:51,280
Scott: mod PHP doesn't take that long to recompile even if your processor sucks.

184
00:10:51,573 --> 00:10:51,720
Rym: Yeah.

185
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:59,560
Rym: So if you ever host a popular podcast and you accidentally update something and it breaks something you can recompile it fairly handily.

186
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:01,063
Scott: Yeah It seems it seemed to be.

187
00:11:01,103 --> 00:11:07,000
Scott: what happened was the configuration file for mod PHP had updated or possibly not updated.

188
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:14,961
Scott: The configuration file that updated didn't match the library that updated because I paused it right and then The.

189
00:11:15,201 --> 00:11:16,204
Scott: then the server went down.

190
00:11:16,245 --> 00:11:17,127
Scott: then I restarted.

191
00:11:17,488 --> 00:11:19,354
Scott: so I must have paused it in between.

192
00:11:19,454 --> 00:11:21,340
Scott: updating the library in the configuration.

193
00:11:22,621 --> 00:11:24,573
Scott: So remerging it fixed both of those things.

194
00:11:25,136 --> 00:11:29,520
Rym: Yeah Actually now that I think about it I paused something once a while.

195
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,483
Rym: It was Firefox.

196
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:35,840
Rym: when I was I compiled Firefox instead of using the bin and I gave myself a whole shitload of trouble here.

197
00:11:36,201 --> 00:11:38,610
Scott: Let's give everyone a little handy Linux tip from Scott.

198
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:38,911
Scott: ready.

199
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,336
Rym: Alright Linux tips from Scott.

200
00:11:40,356 --> 00:11:41,340
Rym: if we had music we'd play it.

201
00:11:41,925 --> 00:11:50,239
Scott: Okay, when you're using Linux Let's say you type in a command and then it starts doing a lot of stuff and it takes like 10 minutes and text is Flying by in your terminal.

202
00:11:50,822 --> 00:11:53,817
Scott: Well, you really don't want to sit there and wait.

203
00:11:53,857 --> 00:11:58,273
Scott: you want you know And you need to use your computer for something else and it's slowing your whole computer down.

204
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:03,820
Scott: you push ctrl Z. This will give you your terminal back and it'll say stopped.

205
00:12:04,281 --> 00:12:07,271
Scott: What it will do is it will stop doing whatever it was doing.

206
00:12:07,733 --> 00:12:08,877
Scott: and now your computer.

207
00:12:08,897 --> 00:12:09,860
Scott: you can go about your business.

208
00:12:09,981 --> 00:12:11,449
Scott: Of course, it's still sitting in RAM.

209
00:12:11,771 --> 00:12:12,716
Scott: Whatever who cares?

210
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:16,860
Scott: now You can do what you're gonna do in your computer watch a video or whatever that you know.

211
00:12:17,061 --> 00:12:20,920
Scott: It can't be slowed down by some background compiling or whatever.

212
00:12:21,065 --> 00:12:27,060
Scott: Yeah Then when it's nighttime and you can go let it finish doing its thing since nighttime is the right time.

213
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:34,559
Scott: Nighttime is that I. you go back into that terminal and you press F G for foreground and you press enter and that will start it up again.

214
00:12:35,303 --> 00:12:37,633
Scott: So that's how you pause and restart things in Linux.

215
00:12:38,296 --> 00:12:40,784
Scott: All right that in Windows Not at all.

216
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:42,009
Scott: That's not even an option.

217
00:12:42,431 --> 00:12:44,640
Scott: Even if you're the god administrator, you can't do that.

218
00:12:44,801 --> 00:12:47,334
Rym: Well you some applications have that built in.

219
00:12:47,817 --> 00:12:53,399
Scott: some do Think of it like when you have your DS and you close the lid on a game and then open it again.

220
00:12:53,789 --> 00:12:58,880
Rym: Yeah So imagine if you could close the lid on the DS and then there was another screen on the outside and you could use that.

221
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:02,449
Scott: Yeah, that's kind of what the analogy breaks down.

222
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,212
Scott: It really does.

223
00:13:03,232 --> 00:13:15,380
Scott: You're basically pausing a program So the program doesn't use your CPU or anything, but it still sits in RAM Exactly the way it was when you paused it and then you could bring it back from the dead if you need, you know.

224
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:17,447
Scott: So if someone that's all it is.

225
00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:18,091
Rym: All right.

226
00:13:18,251 --> 00:13:21,440
Rym: Yeah now I'll just say this What do you guys think of that?

227
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:26,840
Rym: Do you guys want us to periodically just give random tips for say Linux or computing in general?

228
00:13:27,021 --> 00:13:28,088
Scott: Yeah, that's an idea.

229
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:29,417
Scott: I just came up with two seconds ago.

230
00:13:29,457 --> 00:13:33,760
Scott: Yeah, I mean I could do a whole episode of Linux tips from Scott.

231
00:13:34,094 --> 00:13:39,480
Rym: Yeah But I don't think anyone wants to listen to a whole episode because anyone who would be interested in that Probably already knows most of them.

232
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:50,000
Scott: Especially I know at least two of our listeners or at least two of my friends who I know Probably listen at least once or twice if not every time no more about Linux than I do.

233
00:13:50,181 --> 00:13:52,657
Scott: I'm like the third most knowledgeable Linux person.

234
00:13:52,738 --> 00:14:02,004
Scott: I know so they would probably Occasionally yell at me for getting something wrong or doing something an even worse way or Something like that.

235
00:14:02,305 --> 00:14:06,760
Rym: So I you know, yeah, but if you guys like it, we'll just periodically sprinkle little Linux tips in.

236
00:14:07,367 --> 00:14:08,139
Scott: Yeah, could be fun.

237
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:13,478
Rym: If anything for those of you who maybe don't use Linux might be interested in it just starting it'll be a nice little.

238
00:14:13,498 --> 00:14:14,612
Rym: oh I didn't know that.

239
00:14:15,741 --> 00:14:22,530
Scott: Yeah, plus there's a lot of things in Linux are like I know one piece and I know another piece But I never put the pieces together to like.

240
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:23,434
Scott: do something awesome.

241
00:14:23,756 --> 00:14:26,787
Rym: Yeah, if you're new to Linux Wait, do you realize just what you can do with pipes?

242
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:30,238
Rym: Yeah, I mean, but that'll all be for another day.

243
00:14:30,258 --> 00:14:32,144
Scott: It will be Okay.

244
00:14:32,185 --> 00:14:34,179
Scott: Yeah finally found something we can go on and on about.

245
00:14:40,763 --> 00:14:45,300
Rym: So my thing of the day since we were talking about Nintendo and a little bit about Nintendo Wi-Fi.

246
00:14:46,262 --> 00:14:48,732
Rym: As you all know Metroid Prime hunters came out recently.

247
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,904
Scott: So did Tetris DS whoo Now one.

248
00:14:51,984 --> 00:15:00,169
Rym: we just went to the Nintendo Wi-Fi site for Tetris and it is the highest of a chi oldest of old-school Quality website.

249
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:01,479
Scott: Well, you know the Tetris DS.

250
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:08,260
Scott: the the big thing about is a bunch of different Tetris modes and each mode has a theme from a different old-school Nintendo game.

251
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:08,380
Scott: like.

252
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:14,268
Scott: There's a mode that goes a Donkey Kong and a mode that goes with Mario and a Zelda mode and you know Whatever modes it's cool.

253
00:15:15,093 --> 00:15:15,234
Rym: Now.

254
00:15:15,535 --> 00:15:16,320
Rym: That's not my thing of the day.

255
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:22,956
Rym: I just noticed that my thing of the day is that Nintendo Wi-Fi keeps track of who's doing well in all the games.

256
00:15:23,016 --> 00:15:27,093
Scott: Oh, yeah in Mario Kart They only kept track of like who played the most and you could see that.

257
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:30,142
Scott: but it seems like they learn the most Lesson from Mario Kart.

258
00:15:30,202 --> 00:15:31,164
Scott: Yeah in Metroid.

259
00:15:31,204 --> 00:15:40,560
Scott: They have like most headshots most consecutive kills, you know winning percentage All sorts of other great stats that actually mean something.

260
00:15:41,061 --> 00:15:42,304
Rym: Now the leaderboard.

261
00:15:42,364 --> 00:15:52,796
Rym: that shows who is winning in all these stats and there is one player who is obviously the best player At this game currently because he is winning four of the category.

262
00:15:52,877 --> 00:15:59,047
Rym: of four categories He has points games played Consecutive wins and headshots.

263
00:15:59,369 --> 00:16:02,740
Scott: It sounds like this guy's playing a whole lot and he's mastered hitting headshots.

264
00:16:03,021 --> 00:16:16,429
Rym: Yep, though I point out that there is a person Nintendo of America guy who has a 100% kill rate it sounds to me like that guy played one game and One and then didn't play any other games.

265
00:16:16,529 --> 00:16:19,400
Rym: You know what if I buy that I win season Nintendo of America guy.

266
00:16:19,661 --> 00:16:22,029
Scott: Obviously, he made his account before anyone else.

267
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,879
Scott: surprised because he has the earliest account his name shows up.

268
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:30,095
Rym: Yeah, if that's true, I could see Nintendo saying All right, you have to play a game until you lose or something.

269
00:16:30,116 --> 00:16:30,860
Scott: They don't really care.

270
00:16:31,101 --> 00:16:35,080
Rym: Anyway, but my thing of the day is not that this exists or any of that.

271
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,953
Rym: No, it's something much more base and low brow.

272
00:16:38,717 --> 00:16:39,360
Scott: I'm quite low.

273
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,380
Rym: So what the guy who's winning these four categories?

274
00:16:44,342 --> 00:16:52,864
Scott: his name in the game is I Eat poo, that's a pretty typical name for an online FPS type of action.

275
00:16:53,025 --> 00:16:57,100
Rym: Yeah, usually though the people who have those kinds of names don't do very well.

276
00:16:57,764 --> 00:16:59,035
Scott: Well, no, they do quite well.

277
00:16:59,075 --> 00:17:00,667
Rym: sometimes Depends on the game.

278
00:17:00,727 --> 00:17:02,680
Scott: I mean in now you tell you encounter strike.

279
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,789
Scott: There have been quite a few Osama bin Laden's that successfully bombed.

280
00:17:07,133 --> 00:17:08,096
Scott: I think what's funny about it.

281
00:17:08,156 --> 00:17:14,999
Scott: Is that it's a Nintendo and it's you know, it's a bad Somewhat dirty thing but it's on a Nintendo website.

282
00:17:15,663 --> 00:17:21,755
Scott: I mean if the guy's name the guy could have named himself fuck fuck But in that would have showed up on the Nintendo website, that would be awesome.

283
00:17:22,156 --> 00:17:22,800
Rym: Yeah, you know what though?

284
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,563
Rym: I think I like the.

285
00:17:23,683 --> 00:17:28,805
Rym: I eat poo because it's definitely a level of humor where everyone can appreciate that Everyone likes a good poop joke.

286
00:17:29,306 --> 00:17:33,060
Scott: Oh, of course except for when it's you doing the pooping then you don't like it.

287
00:17:33,281 --> 00:17:34,546
Rym: Yeah, like you this morning.

288
00:17:34,566 --> 00:17:36,473
Scott: Yeah, I had some pooping problems.

289
00:17:36,654 --> 00:17:39,702
Rym: Yeah, Scott's got some bowel Issues.

290
00:17:39,722 --> 00:17:40,906
Scott: damn my bowels.

291
00:17:41,469 --> 00:17:43,376
Scott: That's what I get for having the rest of my body.

292
00:17:43,436 --> 00:17:47,177
Scott: being so incredibly perfect is a messed up bowels.

293
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,949
Rym: Anyway, what's your thing of the day?

294
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:53,840
Rym: even though I already know I'm just asking because it's a nice segue.

295
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,794
Scott: So this is flash game called don't shoot the puppy.

296
00:17:59,095 --> 00:18:00,320
Rym: It's harder than you'd think.

297
00:18:00,803 --> 00:18:10,058
Scott: so the way this game works is as a puppy and There's a giant freaking piece of artillery like a howitzer some shit right and it's pointed right at the puppy.

298
00:18:10,078 --> 00:18:15,480
Scott: and There's this sign with a smiley face and there's some words and the words say start.

299
00:18:16,321 --> 00:18:25,139
Scott: See if you click on the words that say start the words that say start disappear and the puppy begins to walk away from the gun And towards the sign with the happy face.

300
00:18:26,002 --> 00:18:31,029
Scott: That's all well and good If you give any input whatsoever.

301
00:18:31,089 --> 00:18:37,553
Scott: because look you just click start which means the focus of your mouse is the flash game Which means if you move the mouse, it'll know.

302
00:18:37,593 --> 00:18:39,282
Scott: if you push a button on your keyboard It'll know.

303
00:18:40,046 --> 00:18:47,540
Scott: any time you give any input to this flash game whatsoever The gun fires and if the puppy is in front of the gun it dies.

304
00:18:48,265 --> 00:18:50,339
Scott: So then you lose if you move the mouse.

305
00:18:51,361 --> 00:18:56,040
Scott: So you basically click start and then don't do anything and you wait until the puppy gets off screen.

306
00:18:56,341 --> 00:18:56,985
Rym: So it starts out.

307
00:18:57,266 --> 00:18:59,477
Rym: the first round one the puppy just walks off the screen.

308
00:18:59,879 --> 00:19:05,697
Scott: in Round two it walks a little slower to make it more frustrating so that you might click or move the mouse.

309
00:19:05,838 --> 00:19:10,720
Scott: in round three It pops up a fake pop-up window that I fell for the first.

310
00:19:12,163 --> 00:19:19,076
Scott: And you know this pop-up window shows up and you go to click X But as soon as you move the mouse the puppy dies And you go damn it.

311
00:19:19,822 --> 00:19:24,740
Scott: So basically you just have to resist doing any sort of input whatsoever for as many levels as possible.

312
00:19:25,344 --> 00:19:27,377
Scott: I was only able to do it for about three minutes.

313
00:19:27,719 --> 00:19:28,764
Scott: now It's like six level.

314
00:19:28,784 --> 00:19:29,788
Rym: favorite two levels is.

315
00:19:29,828 --> 00:19:35,340
Rym: there's one level where the puppies walk in slowly and someone throws a ball at it And it walks over picks up the ball and slowly walks off the screen.

316
00:19:36,163 --> 00:19:36,668
Rym: No big deal.

317
00:19:37,293 --> 00:19:39,284
Rym: the next level the ball.

318
00:19:39,404 --> 00:19:45,103
Rym: you see it go flying from the left of the screen way off to the right where the gun is and then passed off it off the screen.

319
00:19:45,505 --> 00:19:54,020
Rym: and the puppy very slowly starts walking to the right away from the gun off screen and Then like a minute later makes his way back and starts walking across in front of the gun again.

320
00:19:54,020 --> 00:20:00,950
Scott: Yeah But you can feel free to do input while the puppy is to the right of the gun because you can't shoot him over At least if the game isn't that stupid.

321
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:03,179
Scott: where the gun would you know flip over and kill him?

322
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:08,680
Scott: But yeah, I I think if you just waited long enough every level would give you something new and humorous.

323
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:11,914
Scott: But I don't know how many levels there are or how many I could stand to sit through.

324
00:20:12,195 --> 00:20:13,280
Rym: see I like games like this.

325
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,938
Rym: It's the same kind of game as the old classic pick up the phone booth and die.

326
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:17,983
Scott: yeah It's a great game.

327
00:20:18,505 --> 00:20:21,457
Rym: I've any of you out there have ever actually played pick up the phone booth and die?

328
00:20:21,477 --> 00:20:22,220
Scott: the text adventure?

329
00:20:22,401 --> 00:20:23,364
Rym: Yeah, it's very simple.

330
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:24,589
Rym: We'll play it right now.

331
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,798
Rym: I'll be the computer and Scott can be the player.

332
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:28,725
Rym: all right I'll do a simple file.

333
00:20:28,765 --> 00:20:30,392
Scott: I know we'll start with the blank.

334
00:20:30,532 --> 00:20:32,480
Rym: look you see a phone booth.

335
00:20:33,821 --> 00:20:34,605
Scott: Open phone booth.

336
00:20:34,907 --> 00:20:35,972
Rym: you open the phone booth.

337
00:20:35,992 --> 00:20:37,540
Scott: I thought you couldn't open it and pick up the phone.

338
00:20:38,062 --> 00:20:38,705
Rym: I don't remember.

339
00:20:39,066 --> 00:20:42,240
Rym: I haven't actually played pick up the phone booth and I played it once anyway.

340
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,968
Rym: All I know is if you type pick up phone booth.

341
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:55,320
Scott: It says you die and any other sort of Things that you might attempt might yield humorous results, but the game won't go anywhere.

342
00:20:55,421 --> 00:21:01,520
Scott: You'll still be standing there in front of that phone booth like you can make a call But it just says something funny on the screen doesn't actually do anything.

343
00:21:02,481 --> 00:21:08,271
Scott: But the only thing you can actually do to get the game to go anywhere is pick up the phone booth And that's all it does is kill you.

344
00:21:08,975 --> 00:21:09,337
Scott: That's it.

345
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:09,920
Scott: It's all game.

346
00:21:11,702 --> 00:21:16,000
Rym: All right, so today is Thursday meaning we can talk about whatever the hell we want.

347
00:21:17,641 --> 00:21:19,193
Scott: Awesome, what the hell do we want to talk about?

348
00:21:19,476 --> 00:21:20,020
Rym: see honestly?

349
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,288
Rym: We really didn't know until just a little while ago.

350
00:21:22,669 --> 00:21:32,067
Rym: We were trying to think of something nice that didn't require a lot of research or effort mm-hmm and Coincidentally South Park.

351
00:21:32,368 --> 00:21:39,854
Rym: now you all know that Isaac Hayes the noted Scientologist and nutball was a stroke victim.

352
00:21:40,195 --> 00:21:53,361
Rym: Yeah was the voice of chef and after they did their expose on Scientology, he left the show and Then they got in trouble and weren't allowed to show that episode anymore for some shady dealings that the internet is still trying to figure Out.

353
00:21:53,501 --> 00:21:54,845
Scott: yeah, the internet is like.

354
00:21:54,926 --> 00:21:59,740
Scott: maybe Tom Cruise used his Mission Impossible 3 muscle to prevent.

355
00:22:00,161 --> 00:22:02,575
Scott: Maybe they're like Isaac Hayes is still.

356
00:22:02,656 --> 00:22:03,420
Scott: he didn't really quit.

357
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:03,922
Scott: They quit.

358
00:22:04,042 --> 00:22:06,351
Scott: the Scientologist quit for him because he had a stroke.

359
00:22:06,392 --> 00:22:13,160
Scott: He's not no condition to quit anything and It's just a bunch of crazy batshit, which is what I expect from the Church of Scientology.

360
00:22:13,745 --> 00:22:19,679
Rym: now the South Park guys Decided that you know they're gonna handle the situation in the only way they know how.

361
00:22:20,322 --> 00:22:24,176
Rym: So the season the episode one of the newest season came out just now.

362
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:27,455
Scott: Let's spoil the whole thing All right, because the internet does it anyway.

363
00:22:27,475 --> 00:22:30,045
Rym: Yeah, it doesn't matter I mean spoilers for South Park.

364
00:22:30,105 --> 00:22:31,028
Rym: Yeah, Kenny dies.

365
00:22:31,469 --> 00:22:31,650
Scott: Yeah.

366
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:35,120
Scott: Uh, you know what, you know what they call a Jewish woman's boobs?

367
00:22:35,822 --> 00:22:39,073
Rym: That was the most random throwaway joke I've ever heard in my life.

368
00:22:39,655 --> 00:22:41,140
Scott: What do they call the Jewish woman's boobs?

369
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,106
Rym: I don't know Scott.

370
00:22:42,126 --> 00:22:43,460
Rym: What do they call them jubes?

371
00:22:45,481 --> 00:22:55,419
Rym: Actually, I loved in the beginning the episode when they're sitting there playing Uno and just like draw two fatass perverse Jew and they just yeah, you're a verse to Jew.

372
00:22:56,821 --> 00:23:10,879
Rym: But anyway, they basically set it up where chef was brainwashed by this crazy cult and they used Audio from previous South Park episodes to create the episode so that it sounded like Isaac Hayes was still there

373
00:23:11,381 --> 00:23:11,562
Scott: Mm-hmm,

374
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:15,179
Rym: and basically they made chef a pedophile and such and then they killed it.

375
00:23:15,654 --> 00:23:27,511
Scott: well It was pretty interesting because the only things that chef really does when he's in an episode even in the early South Park which is what I mostly watch is he talks to the children and He talks about making love to women.

376
00:23:27,913 --> 00:23:32,339
Scott: In fact, there's this whole song I want to make love to you woman that he sings all the time.

377
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:42,902
Scott: so they took that song and they made an episode where chef wanna make wants to make love to the children because that's the Easiest thing they can get him to say with the dialogue available now.

378
00:23:42,962 --> 00:23:58,039
Rym: the best part of the episode was that this episode was in direct response to the whole Scientology debacle and What they did is basically they made up this new crazy call that they called something else that nothing to his Scientology and then it got to the point where they're going to explain what this cult is about.

379
00:23:58,059 --> 00:24:07,526
Rym: and For those of you who saw their Scientology expose they basically show the whole story of Xenu and all that Scientology be crazy crazy batshit BS.

380
00:24:08,228 --> 00:24:10,835
Rym: and then during it they start flashing the words on the screen.

381
00:24:11,256 --> 00:24:13,684
Rym: This is what they actually believe Mm-hmm.

382
00:24:14,126 --> 00:24:18,062
Scott: That's the one you laugh hysterically because it's all true Absolutely true.

383
00:24:18,463 --> 00:24:24,962
Rym: now this episode did the exact same thing only with this made-up called it was obvious that they were just talking about Scientology The.

384
00:24:25,062 --> 00:24:31,100
Rym: the going theory seems to be that Comedy Central refused to allow them to say the word Scientology in this episode.

385
00:24:31,342 --> 00:24:33,040
Scott: I wish we will just be more transparent.

386
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:39,200
Scott: I mean if someone muscled you into doing something they should say they did it and you should say they did it.

387
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:47,696
Scott: I'm tired of people doing things all secret e and leaving the internet to guess Yeah, like someone's got to have some nuts and just say be some you know open.

388
00:24:47,917 --> 00:24:48,820
Rym: No one has nuts anymore.

389
00:24:48,881 --> 00:24:52,440
Rym: There's no such thing as Cajones Mojo Moxie in the world.

390
00:24:53,562 --> 00:24:57,979
Scott: They looked they looked in their pants and they saw their own testicles.

391
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,977
Scott: so awesome.

392
00:25:01,702 --> 00:25:14,666
Rym: But anyway by watching this episode we thought all right we'll talk about to American animated shows that we've liked modern ones not like Ninja Turtles or mask or or go-bots Pretty much.

393
00:25:14,686 --> 00:25:16,715
Scott: There's only four shows that fit in this category.

394
00:25:16,756 --> 00:25:17,700
Scott: It's South Park feature.

395
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:22,560
Scott: I'm a family guy in The Simpsons which are made by the same guy and three of which are on Fox.

396
00:25:22,842 --> 00:25:29,352
Rym: Yep, actually, I would throw the critic in there to Forget the critics a little old duck man's also a little old.

397
00:25:29,432 --> 00:25:30,195
Rym: I love duck man.

398
00:25:30,255 --> 00:25:32,343
Rym: I could do a whole show on duck man Could you really?

399
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:34,812
Rym: yeah, I've watched duck man religiously.

400
00:25:34,872 --> 00:25:36,940
Scott: I didn't watch enough of it cuz it was on kind of late.

401
00:25:37,409 --> 00:25:37,920
Rym: I watched it.

402
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:50,140
Rym: The thing is as my parents started seeing what the show was about they were kind of leery of me watching it because I was A young kid and I remember the one time I watched it in my grandparents house And my grandma's sitting there watching it.

403
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:54,379
Rym: My grandpa's laughing hysterically and my grandma's just like I don't think he should be watching this.

404
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:59,000
Scott: Yeah, what about do you want to get this beavis and butthead count does?

405
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,079
Rym: Honestly, I watched a beavis and butthead off and on but I didn't really like it that much.

406
00:26:04,601 --> 00:26:09,340
Rym: However, the movie I think was actually an excellent piece of film, but everyone thinks the movie was excellent.

407
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:14,535
Scott: But the movie was also just a vehicle to push some hit music of the time.

408
00:26:15,076 --> 00:26:16,380
Rym: Yeah, but so was beavis and butthead.

409
00:26:16,701 --> 00:26:19,770
Scott: Yeah, well beavis and butthead didn't really push hit music.

410
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:23,120
Scott: It pushed like this crap metal and shit that no one cares.

411
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,066
Rym: Hey, they like guar.

412
00:26:24,086 --> 00:26:25,415
Rym: Yeah, I like guar.

413
00:26:25,435 --> 00:26:27,686
Scott: Yeah Yeah, yeah.

414
00:26:27,929 --> 00:26:28,191
Scott: Yeah.

415
00:26:28,595 --> 00:26:28,757
Scott: Yeah.

416
00:26:31,901 --> 00:26:38,219
Rym: So anyway today we're gonna talk about South Park because I don't know whatever we could talk about whatever we want.

417
00:26:38,239 --> 00:26:42,372
Rym: and Then Futurama because we actually just rented a Netflix.

418
00:26:42,653 --> 00:26:44,440
Rym: all the Futurama that's ever come out in order.

419
00:26:45,022 --> 00:26:54,872
Rym: Well, well to kind of fill in the gaps that we've missed over the fact that the show is gone like gone gone alright, so What's the best episode of South Park ever?

420
00:26:55,254 --> 00:26:56,580
Rym: See that's a really tough for me.

421
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:59,499
Rym: It would have to be that the spoof they did on the Lord of the Rings.

422
00:27:00,182 --> 00:27:03,515
Scott: Oh for me, it's the one where the kid Cartman makes the kid eat his parents.

423
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:04,880
Rym: I made you eat your parents.

424
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,420
Scott: I made you eat your parents.

425
00:27:06,962 --> 00:27:09,069
Rym: Now a little bit of history of South Park.

426
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:12,420
Rym: it came out pretty much just as we were going into high school.

427
00:27:12,883 --> 00:27:15,099
Scott: Yeah, like late middle school times for us.

428
00:27:15,641 --> 00:27:20,660
Scott: Wait, so the story was is they made some like goofy little like thing about a snowman or something.

429
00:27:21,161 --> 00:27:27,200
Scott: It was like they literally cut out construction paper and made this show that was like it was like 10 minutes long.

430
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,392
Rym: You could find not even that it's so short and crappy.

431
00:27:29,412 --> 00:27:30,860
Scott: You could find it on the internet somewhere.

432
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,884
Scott: It's short and shitty.

433
00:27:32,206 --> 00:27:34,335
Rym: then they made a second episode Jesus vs.

434
00:27:34,395 --> 00:27:34,797
Rym: Santa.

435
00:27:35,138 --> 00:27:43,719
Rym: Yep, and That was the thing that basically Catapulted them into actual stardom because after that they were approached and hey make us a show.

436
00:27:44,542 --> 00:27:49,280
Scott: Nowadays people make shit like that on the internet all the time and no one approaches anyone for a show.

437
00:27:49,762 --> 00:27:53,343
Scott: The thing was is they made this little cardboard cutout thing Before.

438
00:27:53,403 --> 00:27:58,900
Scott: people were making things like that every five minutes and they made it like with effort and such and it was actually funny.

439
00:27:59,401 --> 00:28:06,384
Rym: Yeah, though it was very I mean the show like The Simpsons and every other show like this started out very differently until it found It's kind of groove.

440
00:28:06,925 --> 00:28:10,297
Rym: I mean The Simpsons for those of you who might forget was about Bart.

441
00:28:10,538 --> 00:28:16,198
Scott: when it started It was all Bart and then it was Homer jokes, and then it finally, you know found the thing of.

442
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:18,689
Scott: you know Show a plot and give a message.

443
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:21,040
Rym: Yep, you know South Park was the same way.

444
00:28:21,181 --> 00:28:23,900
Rym: It started with a bunch of foul-mouthed kids swearing at each other.

445
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:30,320
Rym: That was pretty much the whole show for an entire season and really just nasty stuff like poop jokes.

446
00:28:30,962 --> 00:28:35,920
Rym: Oh, yeah, it was funny, but I think it was only funny in retrospect because I was in high school.

447
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:42,020
Scott: Yeah, I think the first the first episode that really people thought was hysterical was the Thanksgiving episode.

448
00:28:43,381 --> 00:28:44,243
Rym: Actually remember that one.

449
00:28:44,384 --> 00:28:45,848
Scott: Yeah, that was the point.

450
00:28:46,189 --> 00:29:07,620
Rym: Yeah, but then as the show evolved it actually started becoming one political But not political in any in particular direction just political and topical in general and to it pull The Simpsons Instead of just having it be about you know the four boys and the crap whatever jokes They always made they expanded it and added all these other characters that used to be side characters in his main characters.

451
00:29:08,002 --> 00:29:10,694
Scott: You know I think what it is is when you make a show.

452
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:15,219
Scott: in your early days You're just trying to make your show and you think real hard about it.

453
00:29:15,581 --> 00:29:22,324
Scott: But then eventually over time you get into a groove and you develop a formula and the formula is what allows you to keep making Shows forever and ever.

454
00:29:22,867 --> 00:29:35,018
Scott: the thing is is that if your formula is really good you can keep making really good episodes forever and ever like mushishi had a good formula and Guess South Park has a good formula in The Simpsons has a good formula.

455
00:29:35,078 --> 00:29:39,033
Scott: Yep I mean the South Park formula is pretty much like you know.

456
00:29:39,114 --> 00:29:40,619
Scott: something terrible happens.

457
00:29:42,403 --> 00:29:48,240
Scott: The boys go and basically say wow this is dumb Man our parents have done some shit.

458
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,247
Scott: Don't ever actually really do anything to fix it.

459
00:29:50,487 --> 00:29:52,253
Scott: so much is just you know.

460
00:29:52,273 --> 00:30:07,646
Scott: go around and talk right to the idiots who are Making the stupid things happen, and then somehow the stupid thing is resolved and usually after some crazy event like you know involving sex and violence or Vomiting or some other hilarity.

461
00:30:08,289 --> 00:30:10,276
Scott: and then the episodes over and they teach you a lesson.

462
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:13,956
Rym: now when the show started It really was quite literally just swearing and poop jokes

463
00:30:14,378 --> 00:30:14,660
Scott: yeah

464
00:30:15,082 --> 00:30:19,460
Rym: And it wasn't very stimulating in any way other than on a very low brow level

465
00:30:19,841 --> 00:30:25,656
Scott: Yeah, and then they they went into like some sort of sensationalist kind of crap old TV type of stuff like.

466
00:30:25,977 --> 00:30:31,153
Scott: they made the Christmas Episode and they introduced you know they have like a Christmas poop, but it was his name.

467
00:30:31,233 --> 00:30:32,818
Rym: Oh, mr.. Hanky.

468
00:30:32,899 --> 00:30:33,140
Scott: yeah, mr.

469
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,766
Scott: Hanky the Christmas poo that was it.

470
00:30:34,927 --> 00:30:38,630
Rym: yeah, they basically are trying to be the grossest most sensationalist crap They could come up with.

471
00:30:39,077 --> 00:30:44,540
Rym: yeah And then this actually culminated in one of the most infamous practical jokes that's ever been played on.

472
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,667
Scott: I was gonna talk about it.

473
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:47,278
Rym: Oh the Terrence and Philip thing.

474
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:56,179
Scott: yeah So Cartman if you don't know one of the characters is Cartman the fat kid no one likes And he has a mom who's a whore and his dad doesn't exist in the show.

475
00:30:56,507 --> 00:31:01,160
Scott: Yeah So they were gonna do this two episode thing and reveal his father in the second episode.

476
00:31:01,463 --> 00:31:03,159
Rym: So they dragged it out to all hell.

477
00:31:03,622 --> 00:31:06,797
Rym: Like dragged it out and dragged it out, and then they were what it wasn't it like.

478
00:31:06,817 --> 00:31:08,729
Rym: alright You'll have to find out like next season.

479
00:31:08,971 --> 00:31:09,293
Scott: No.

480
00:31:09,374 --> 00:31:10,059
Scott: Yeah, it was find out.

481
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:10,462
Scott: It was.

482
00:31:10,542 --> 00:31:12,680
Scott: I don't was next season or next episode or something.

483
00:31:13,444 --> 00:31:14,449
Scott: What happened was the.

484
00:31:15,152 --> 00:31:26,560
Scott: you know they showed you an episode And you were pretty sure that in the next episode they were gonna tell you his father was because they said so the next episode They were about to tell you and then they showed the whole episode was Terrence and Philip farting at each other.

485
00:31:26,741 --> 00:31:33,354
Rym: They literally just made this other cartoon and showed it for a half hour And then it was over and they didn't tell you.

486
00:31:33,435 --> 00:31:35,586
Scott: and then the next week They fixed the result.

487
00:31:35,606 --> 00:31:38,217
Rym: they actually got in trouble with Comedy Central over that.

488
00:31:38,539 --> 00:31:40,206
Rym: yeah I mean they got complaints.

489
00:31:40,246 --> 00:31:43,099
Rym: people stopped listening and the show actually lost a lot of viewers for a while.

490
00:31:43,725 --> 00:31:48,977
Scott: Mm-hmm I mean they all probably too You know because they could find out what happened just by looking on the internet or something.

491
00:31:49,158 --> 00:31:56,647
Rym: yep They're watching the news though not too long after that the show actually got clever and currently in its current incarnation I actually really enjoy it.

492
00:31:56,969 --> 00:32:07,560
Scott: Yeah, it's like for a while after that I stopped watching mostly because I stopped watching TV not because I didn't like South Park anymore But it's like I sort of forgot about it, and then you know it's still around.

493
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:08,282
Scott: I mean this.

494
00:32:08,402 --> 00:32:13,918
Scott: the chef episode just now was season 10 episode 1 season 10. these guys have been doing this for 10 years.

495
00:32:14,764 --> 00:32:26,545
Scott: Yeah, 10 years All right, but yeah now it goes into the formula that I described already And that seems to be what every South Park episode is and they're all pretty good and honestly I mean the guys who do it.

496
00:32:26,586 --> 00:32:27,107
Rym: They're smart.

497
00:32:27,168 --> 00:32:29,134
Rym: They've made some crap things before.

498
00:32:29,275 --> 00:32:30,800
Rym: the thing is I think they did it on purpose.

499
00:32:31,522 --> 00:32:33,388
Scott: Yeah, the other thing is they seem to be able to.

500
00:32:33,468 --> 00:32:37,280
Scott: really a lot of cartoons can't be very topical like The Simpsons.

501
00:32:37,701 --> 00:32:43,540
Scott: Can't you know talk about something that's going on right now because The Simpsons was never any more topical than like Conan O'Brien was?

502
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:44,724
Scott: Yeah, it seems to be.

503
00:32:44,744 --> 00:32:50,459
Scott: you know most cartoons are timeless like they kind of say general stuff And they can't be very specific.

504
00:32:50,922 --> 00:32:54,680
Scott: South Park can be real specific because I don't think it takes them very long at all to make one.

505
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:58,120
Scott: I mean they just made the chef one in a few days if I'm not mistaken

506
00:32:58,702 --> 00:33:06,981
Rym: Yep, and I gotta say I actually gained a lot of respect for them after they made the Scientology episode And I recommend that anyone who hasn't seen it because we've talked about it It's

507
00:33:07,242 --> 00:33:08,045
Scott: all over the internet.

508
00:33:08,085 --> 00:33:10,073
Rym: Yeah, we've talked about it multiple times on this show.

509
00:33:10,153 --> 00:33:11,277
Rym: It's on Google video.

510
00:33:11,317 --> 00:33:17,900
Rym: It's on YouTube Yeah, I mean because basically they were told as far as anyone can tell by Comedy Central to not ever show that episode again.

511
00:33:18,221 --> 00:33:18,602
Scott: We don't know.

512
00:33:18,683 --> 00:33:23,320
Rym: Maybe they will maybe they won't but it's everywhere on the internet and no one's doing anything about that.

513
00:33:23,581 --> 00:33:25,167
Scott: Well, no one can do anything about it.

514
00:33:25,207 --> 00:33:26,291
Scott: Yeah, but what is it?

515
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:27,857
Scott: Scientology is a crazy cult.

516
00:33:28,057 --> 00:33:28,720
Scott: don't join it.

517
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:33,733
Scott: And if you see a Scientologist harass them harass them harass them harass them some more.

518
00:33:33,874 --> 00:33:36,260
Rym: now the fact that South Park actually had the balls.

519
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:36,882
Rym: They stood up.

520
00:33:37,183 --> 00:33:41,376
Rym: they made this absolutely scathing show about Scientology.

521
00:33:41,456 --> 00:33:42,218
Scott: Oh, it's not scathing.

522
00:33:42,278 --> 00:33:42,840
Scott: It's just truthful.

523
00:33:43,381 --> 00:33:46,290
Rym: Well, yeah, it's truthful, but it's also scathing a hundred percent truth.

524
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:46,992
Rym: the truth hurts.

525
00:33:47,313 --> 00:33:49,178
Scott: Yeah, there's nothing you know.

526
00:33:49,399 --> 00:33:54,700
Scott: exam What's the word that exaggerated exaggerated or hyperbolic about it?

527
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,160
Rym: I mean it was funny and explaining Xenu the alien and that when those words this is what?

528
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,029
Rym: Scientologists actually believe started flashing on the site.

529
00:34:02,109 --> 00:34:02,591
Rym: I lost it.

530
00:34:02,952 --> 00:34:03,976
Rym: I just I just cracked up.

531
00:34:04,137 --> 00:34:05,000
Rym: I couldn't take it anymore.

532
00:34:05,462 --> 00:34:08,619
Scott: Yep, at least it informed a whole bunch of people who didn't know.

533
00:34:09,253 --> 00:34:15,739
Rym: Yep Cuz I remember someone messaged me who listens to GeekNights right after we watched the episode and then talked about it.

534
00:34:16,201 --> 00:34:18,148
Rym: And they asked me is that really true?

535
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:21,780
Rym: and I had to respond with a link to clan bake.

536
00:34:22,206 --> 00:34:30,900
Scott: Yeah, followed by the word Yes Scientologists really believe in the Thetans and the evil alien overlord Xenu and the airplanes and the volcanoes and the whole thing.

537
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:34,293
Rym: I just liked a bit at the end where they basically just told yeah sue us.

538
00:34:34,574 --> 00:34:35,619
Rym: Come on do it sue me.

539
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:38,429
Scott: Yeah, I think they because the.

540
00:34:38,913 --> 00:34:47,243
Scott: I think the deal was that The Church of Scientology what they like to do is if you do something to make them look bad They'll come and sue you.

541
00:34:47,464 --> 00:34:48,447
Scott: so it's sort of a deterrent.

542
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:50,716
Scott: but South Park has there.

543
00:34:50,775 --> 00:34:53,967
Scott: those guys are so smart They wanted Scientology to sue them.

544
00:34:54,268 --> 00:34:57,740
Scott: that way they can make a lot of publicity about how Scientology is crazy.

545
00:34:58,327 --> 00:35:04,109
Scott: It was like, you know free Anti-scientology Advertising if they actually got into a lawsuit.

546
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:04,711
Rym: Yep.

547
00:35:05,072 --> 00:35:06,498
Rym: I actually would have liked to see a lawsuit.

548
00:35:06,518 --> 00:35:09,698
Scott: that would have been hilarious Double more hilarious than the show.

549
00:35:11,022 --> 00:35:12,227
Scott: No, so let's talk about some more.

550
00:35:12,629 --> 00:35:18,520
Scott: the episode where Cartman makes his kid eats his parents So Scott tenorman must die is another episode that I highly recommend.

551
00:35:18,661 --> 00:35:25,899
Rym: Basically what we're doing now is if you saw South Park and knew it was crappy and poop jokes and stopped watching a long time Give it one more chance.

552
00:35:26,662 --> 00:35:31,738
Scott: Yeah, so this episode what happens is Cartman who's a kid that deserves everything he gets.

553
00:35:31,858 --> 00:35:39,240
Scott: but These older kids who are like middle school or maybe even freshman in high school or something start bothering him and picking on him.

554
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,980
Scott: But he deserves it because he's Cartman, but who cares?

555
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,531
Scott: They start making like jokes about him with like pubes.

556
00:35:45,793 --> 00:35:47,400
Scott: They're like a pubes pubes.

557
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,833
Rym: Yeah, I just said that the show got clever and wasn't poop jokes anymore.

558
00:35:52,195 --> 00:35:54,765
Scott: Yeah, it's still dirty But it's it.

559
00:35:54,805 --> 00:35:55,590
Scott: there's something to it.

560
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:56,113
Scott: Yeah, it is.

561
00:35:56,394 --> 00:35:57,078
Rym: It's very clever.

562
00:35:57,098 --> 00:36:01,733
Scott: and Then like all you know Cartman tries to get revenge and he doesn't.

563
00:36:01,894 --> 00:36:07,239
Scott: he tries to get revenge and he doesn't And he tries to get revenge and it looks like he you know doesn't fine, you know, yeah

564
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:15,082
Rym: They set up like this huge elaborate like Wow Cartman's plan is hugely elaborate and we know it's going to fail because information the show Is given to us.

565
00:36:15,343 --> 00:36:21,700
Scott: Yep, and then somehow Cartman's plan is like his final plan isn't completely stupid like all his previous plans.

566
00:36:22,063 --> 00:36:37,805
Scott: It's actually incredibly intelligent and in the end He actually like gets this kid turns his parents into chili and the kid ends up eating his own parents and then the kids favorite rock band comes and tells him he's a sissy for crying and It's just insane and

567
00:36:38,407 --> 00:36:41,720
Rym: I guarantee it's actually funny not just horrible like we just described.

568
00:36:42,041 --> 00:36:43,987
Scott: It's it's funny because it's horrible.

569
00:36:44,288 --> 00:36:44,529
Rym: Yep.

570
00:36:45,432 --> 00:36:50,410
Rym: I mean, I guess just give South Park a chance if you gave up on it a long Time ago, it's clever and topical and I enjoy it.

571
00:36:50,712 --> 00:36:50,852
Rym: Yep.

572
00:36:51,194 --> 00:36:51,977
Scott: I also enjoy it.

573
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:52,580
Rym: now.

574
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:55,069
Rym: We also thought we'd talk today a little bit about Futurama.

575
00:36:55,390 --> 00:37:00,951
Rym: Futurama is awesome, which is one of my favorite Television shows not including anime ever.

576
00:37:01,373 --> 00:37:12,077
Scott: Yep, and for anyone who doesn't know We're 90% sure there are going to be four DVD only movies of Futurama a new stuff that is going to be released in the future,

577
00:37:12,419 --> 00:37:17,635
Rym: which is Fantastic because all the voice actors and Matt groaning and everyone love Futurama

578
00:37:18,076 --> 00:37:19,240
Scott: mostly because of bender.

579
00:37:19,982 --> 00:37:25,920
Scott: It's all about bender and his shiny metal ass his glorious golden ass is splintery wooden man.

580
00:37:27,473 --> 00:37:34,568
Rym: Yeah So Futurama was done by obviously Matt groaning the same guy who did the Simpsons And the only real.

581
00:37:34,628 --> 00:37:34,849
Rym: I mean.

582
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:36,580
Rym: at first the shows look very similar.

583
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:40,624
Rym: They're done in a similar style just you know ones in the future and ones in Simpson's land.

584
00:37:40,644 --> 00:37:52,728
Scott: well Futurama is a lot more CG because in the future Yeah, and it has a lot more pop culture II jokes and the Simpsons has more like society Human nature type of joke Simpsons used to.

585
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:55,318
Rym: from what I hear the Simpsons now is nothing but topical jokes.

586
00:37:55,438 --> 00:37:55,880
Rym: Oh, really?

587
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:56,864
Rym: Yes, what I've heard.

588
00:37:56,884 --> 00:37:57,929
Scott: Well, I haven't seen it.

589
00:37:57,969 --> 00:38:00,140
Rym: I haven't seen the Simpsons in like four years.

590
00:38:00,241 --> 00:38:01,398
Scott: You'll have to go check it out.

591
00:38:01,974 --> 00:38:10,193
Rym: Yeah But anyway, the show is it's very similar to in terms of just the humor and the way it's set up Except that the characters are more real more fleshed out.

592
00:38:10,575 --> 00:38:11,820
Rym: The show is not always funny.

593
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:17,763
Rym: it's actually multiple times very serious or sad or heartwarming and There's a plot.

594
00:38:18,346 --> 00:38:19,150
Rym: it is episodic.

595
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:23,429
Rym: You can just watch random episodes, but there is a General slowly advancing plot.

596
00:38:23,771 --> 00:38:26,784
Rym: that kind of climaxes in the last episode Mm-hmm.

597
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:28,172
Scott: I didn't.

598
00:38:28,634 --> 00:38:29,680
Scott: it's not really a big plot.

599
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:33,960
Scott: It's just sort of like oh these things sort of connect and then they make a story out of it.

600
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:42,194
Rym: Yeah, well that and all also just it actually does kind of explore ideas of what if you were frozen and came back in the Far far future and everyone you knew and loved was dead.

601
00:38:42,858 --> 00:38:45,027
Scott: Yep That's a yeah.

602
00:38:45,349 --> 00:38:46,777
Scott: And also I like how it.

603
00:38:48,041 --> 00:38:54,765
Scott: Not only does it explore that but explores like what would the future really be like of this world and a lot of the things They do in the you know in the future.

604
00:38:54,806 --> 00:38:58,620
Scott: It's just silly like all kinds of crazy aliens and all kinds of drinking robots.

605
00:38:58,781 --> 00:38:59,728
Scott: You know, it's funny stuff.

606
00:38:59,748 --> 00:39:11,273
Scott: But a lot of the stuff is like, you know Like like the famous people's heads in jars and stuff and It's a lot of commentary on like advertising and it's definitely realistic.

607
00:39:11,314 --> 00:39:13,340
Rym: in the same way that snow crash was realistic.

608
00:39:13,641 --> 00:39:15,026
Rym: It's obviously hyperbole.

609
00:39:15,327 --> 00:39:18,560
Rym: But then again, you wouldn't put it past some people to try some of these things.

610
00:39:18,921 --> 00:39:25,602
Scott: Yeah, the other thing a lot of future on my episodes do that's really good is when they go to alien worlds that have crazy Situations.

611
00:39:26,224 --> 00:39:32,846
Scott: so it really lets you do lets the creators do all sorts of crazy stuff crazy crazy And of course bender.

612
00:39:33,308 --> 00:39:34,734
Rym: Yeah bender benders my man.

613
00:39:34,754 --> 00:39:45,657
Scott: I think the best episode of Futurama is the one where benders like floating in space and He becomes God because there's a bun this little Lilliputians living on him and then he meets God for real.

614
00:39:45,998 --> 00:39:46,540
Scott: That's a good one.

615
00:39:46,961 --> 00:39:49,808
Rym: Yep, actually, that's a very good episode from a number of perspectives.

616
00:39:49,849 --> 00:39:51,553
Rym: It's funny, but it's also very poignant.

617
00:39:51,834 --> 00:39:54,180
Rym: Yeah serious good philosophical interesting.

618
00:39:54,301 --> 00:39:56,520
Scott: Yeah, it's not just like, you know some silly joke.

619
00:39:56,620 --> 00:40:01,220
Scott: It's actually like oh, it's silly because you know the people do something but it's also.

620
00:40:02,282 --> 00:40:03,645
Scott: Look, that's what people do.

621
00:40:04,147 --> 00:40:04,407
Rym: Of course.

622
00:40:04,447 --> 00:40:08,097
Rym: We can't talk about Futurama without mentioning the infamous dog episode.

623
00:40:08,117 --> 00:40:14,979
Rym: Oh Remember the one where fry finds the fossil of his the dog that he used to have?

624
00:40:15,822 --> 00:40:16,003
Scott: Nope.

625
00:40:16,526 --> 00:40:23,800
Rym: Alright, he finds that this episode for people who are fans of Futurama It's widely known because the end is just so incredibly sad and unexpected.

626
00:40:24,884 --> 00:40:33,077
Rym: but he finds this fossil of his dog and The professor says oh I can use my science to to bring make a clone and bring the dog back.

627
00:40:33,819 --> 00:40:43,758
Rym: and Fry is so excited about this that he forgets about all his real friends, you know vendor And I'm not really gonna ruin the episode, but it just ends on just this sad like there's not even a joke there.

628
00:40:43,819 --> 00:40:47,811
Scott: It's just sad Mmm, I imagine the dog dies or something.

629
00:40:48,092 --> 00:40:49,639
Rym: No, it's actually sadder than that.

630
00:40:51,041 --> 00:41:02,331
Rym: Like that basically the at the show is and it's a typical episode and then the end of the episode While the credits are rolling you realize that there's no joke coming That they weren't making a joke and it just it ends.

631
00:41:02,833 --> 00:41:03,074
Scott: Uh-huh.

632
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:07,179
Rym: I Just a lot of people have mentioned this episode when they talk about Futurama.

633
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,327
Rym: So we could definitely not go without speaking of it.

634
00:41:09,547 --> 00:41:13,400
Scott: Yeah, let's talk about two of my other favorite episodes.

635
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:15,768
Scott: It's the one where the pair of box.

636
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:20,324
Scott: Yeah, there's basically this box and if you go in the box It takes you to another dimension.

637
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:21,748
Scott: So what or another universe?

638
00:41:22,269 --> 00:41:23,092
Scott: So what ends up happening?

639
00:41:23,152 --> 00:41:25,579
Scott: Is this two different versions of all?

640
00:41:26,121 --> 00:41:31,297
Scott: The main characters together one from one universe a and another from universe B. The only different we're.

641
00:41:31,357 --> 00:41:32,140
Rym: universe awesome.

642
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:42,980
Scott: Yeah the leaders in universe A and B is that in universe B every coin toss came up on tails instead of heads and vice-versa and That has some interesting results.

643
00:41:43,245 --> 00:41:46,006
Rym: It's one of the most quotable episodes of Futurama ever.

644
00:41:46,067 --> 00:41:53,296
Scott: that sure is because the best part is where they're running through all these different boxes trying to find The Zoidberg's who ran away the two Zoidberg's.

645
00:41:53,336 --> 00:41:57,960
Scott: Yeah, great Right goes Edward.

646
00:41:59,381 --> 00:42:15,748
Scott: so they're all the other characters that aren't Zoidberg's are looking for the Zoidberg's and the two benders and One of them comes out of a box and he said he is holding a like a pot full of gold and he says Hey See what I got from the leprechaun universe and

647
00:42:15,768 --> 00:42:16,430
Rym: the other benders.

648
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:20,703
Rym: like leprechaun universe is well and good if you haven't seen pirate universe.

649
00:42:20,844 --> 00:42:25,048
Scott: and then he brings out this pirate chest full of gold and Chalices and whatnot?

650
00:42:25,069 --> 00:42:28,483
Scott: faith and begora faith and begora Yeah pirate universe.

651
00:42:29,085 --> 00:42:39,700
Rym: and just the scene at the end when they finally like they come out of the box and they all pop out of The box into the incinerator where Hermes finger is hovering over the button to destroy them all because he was supposed to destroy the box.

652
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:49,650
Rym: Long story short the box says no and they all pop up and Hermes is sitting there with his finger on the button and the Professors looking at him like Hermes whatever you do don't hit that button.

653
00:42:49,971 --> 00:42:54,848
Rym: and Hermes obviously sits there for like five seconds Considering before he decides not to.

654
00:42:54,929 --> 00:42:57,660
Scott: Hermes is really the only guy in the show who he's like the straight, man.

655
00:42:58,223 --> 00:42:59,189
Scott: You know, I mean sure he has.

656
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:00,960
Scott: he's not perfectly straight.

657
00:43:01,622 --> 00:43:06,740
Scott: I'm not talking about his sexuality and talking about you know in terms of like Abbot and Costello straight, man.

658
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:18,195
Scott: And yeah, man, like he does the limbo and it's funny and he has a couple episodes dedicated to him but he's mostly the only one who's intelligent and smart and not wacky.

659
00:43:18,636 --> 00:43:27,877
Rym: now the other episode that we Personally love and oh The one that ends with the words and that little one is how Papa gets freedom.

660
00:43:28,399 --> 00:43:37,106
Rym: and now Bon-hui bon-hui to you all Bon-hui, it was just this random Gargoyle themed ending.

661
00:43:37,306 --> 00:43:39,473
Scott: Yeah, so the episode is where the beginning.

662
00:43:39,774 --> 00:43:47,346
Scott: the professor is dealing with his gargoyle Right, and then the gargoyle gets away right and then The episode.

663
00:43:47,407 --> 00:43:50,020
Scott: something else completely hat different happens in the episode.

664
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:57,974
Scott: there's like a fountain of youth or something and like everyone falls into the fountain of youth and Like while the professor is in the fountain of youth.

665
00:43:58,014 --> 00:43:59,160
Scott: He's like I curse.

666
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:02,913
Rym: Yeah, the professor's dying and he just screams with my last breath.

667
00:44:03,034 --> 00:44:04,740
Rym: I curse Zoidberg.

668
00:44:05,922 --> 00:44:08,934
Rym: It's just the most random like as whole ish act.

669
00:44:09,215 --> 00:44:17,178
Scott: Yeah, and then It's like if I was if like I was bleeding to death on the ground that I said with my last breath Curse Rym and then I died.

670
00:44:19,121 --> 00:44:24,640
Scott: But then the gargoyle saves him from death and it's you know, the gargoyle hadn't been there since early in the episode.

671
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:36,139
Scott: So I was like all the gargoyles back and then the gargoyle Talks to his little baby gargoyle at the end of the episode and he says and that little one is how Papa gets free them Bon-hui bon-hui to you all.

672
00:44:37,164 --> 00:44:41,722
Rym: it also has because the whole episode is about old age and old people and Like.

673
00:44:41,923 --> 00:44:48,410
Rym: they're going through this whole thing and then they find like they're trying to get the gargoyle back for the professor And he the whole thing is like he's not an old man.

674
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:49,615
Rym: I'm still young blah blah blah.

675
00:44:50,680 --> 00:45:04,423
Rym: and They finally like are tracking down the gargoyle and they say something to him like look We're gonna get your gargoyle and he's like my wife my wife My wife my wife and the way he says why it's hilarious My wife.

676
00:45:05,005 --> 00:45:05,928
Rym: Yeah, you can tell we're geeks.

677
00:45:05,968 --> 00:45:09,420
Rym: We fixate on the most like specific random bits of humor.

678
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:13,871
Scott: Yeah, yeah, that's how it's how it is though.

679
00:45:13,991 --> 00:45:20,074
Rym: I can imagine that we'll be talking about Futurama more Periodically and randomly for the next several weeks and months.

00:45:20,214 --> 00:45:21,279
Rym: as we watch all of it again.

681
00:45:21,701 --> 00:45:24,471

00:45:24,531 --> 00:45:26,016
Scott: I'll just remember them and say them again.

683
