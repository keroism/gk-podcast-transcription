1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:14,420
Rym: It's Monday, December 1st, I'm Rym, I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights!

2
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:19,058
Rym: Tonight, after a lot of other discussions, we talk briefly about how to interview tech people.

3
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:26,908
Scott: Let's do this!

4
00:00:30,901 --> 00:00:41,255
Rym: So it was a Monday, and I had done laundry, as I often do on the weekends, so I could choose from any of the shirts that I own, I own many shirts, I could choose any one of them.

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,700
Rym: So of all the shirts that I own, I chose to wear a blue dress shirt to work today.

6
00:00:47,402 --> 00:00:56,599
Rym: I get to work, and it just so happens that every single person in the entire tech department wore a blue collared shirt today.

7
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,697
Rym: Every single one of us.

8
00:00:59,441 --> 00:01:01,880
Scott: But, so, I mean, how many colors are there?

9
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:13,840
Scott: I mean, white, blue, darker blue, black, red, yeah, I mean, you know, it's not like some freak of nature that everyone wears blue, one of the most common shirt colors.

10
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,420
Rym: But the fact, the thing is, people don't wear blue that often.

11
00:01:16,563 --> 00:01:17,540
Rym: I wear blue more than anyone.

12
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,740
Rym: Most people wear green or black or something, or they wear, like, a sweater.

13
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,880
Rym: But the fact that everyone was wearing blue was kind of, it was kind of surprising.

14
00:01:25,381 --> 00:01:27,820
Rym: We declared that we won some sort of arbitrary prize.

15
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:29,038
Scott: All right.

16
00:01:30,127 --> 00:01:30,859
Scott: Is that all you got there?

17
00:01:31,001 --> 00:01:31,619
Rym: That's all I got.

18
00:01:32,484 --> 00:01:33,477
Scott: All right, so check this out.

19
00:01:35,222 --> 00:01:45,060
Scott: I don't want to tell this whole story because, you know, the person who told me the story, because it's about them, you know, if you're going to hear it, it's going to be from them and not a secondhand story.

20
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,400
Scott: But basically, I don't know if I said this on the show yet.

21
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,223
Scott: I don't think I have.

22
00:01:49,283 --> 00:01:54,480
Scott: is that my the person who was until very recently, my boss.

23
00:01:54,942 --> 00:01:59,159
Rym: Oh, oh, you're going to tell a story that you told me a while ago and you were probably saving for a Monday.

24
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,946
Scott: Yeah, he was the.

25
00:02:01,146 --> 00:02:06,135
Rym: I went with the topical, the reason the the actual thing from I got more going on.

26
00:02:07,622 --> 00:02:09,740
Scott: He I'm not going to tell the whole story of it.

27
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,740
Scott: You'll have to wait maybe to hear that.

28
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,524
Scott: But he is the.

29
00:02:13,268 --> 00:02:15,600
Scott: he tells me and I'm pretty sure he's correct.

30
00:02:15,845 --> 00:02:16,540
Scott: He's not lying.

31
00:02:17,161 --> 00:02:21,060
Scott: He was the youngest, perhaps the youngest victim of Operation Sun Devil.

32
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,859
Scott: You can go look up what Operation Sun Devil is.

33
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,800
Rym: Operation Sun Devil is infamous among tech people.

34
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,015
Rym: It has a lot to do with the 70s.

35
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:38,700
Scott: It has a lot to do with Apple twos in the early 80s and, you know, and pirating and BBS's and dial up modem BBS's.

36
00:02:38,821 --> 00:02:40,699
Rym: I mean, we grew up on the Secret Service.

37
00:02:40,881 --> 00:02:43,060
Rym: We grew up on the tail end of the BBS days.

38
00:02:43,441 --> 00:02:43,682
Scott: Right.

39
00:02:44,185 --> 00:02:46,719
Scott: So he apparently has a flaw.

40
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:54,319
Scott: He tells me as a floppy disk that has the BBS he wrote in like some language that was only ever used to write BBS's for the Apple two.

41
00:02:54,962 --> 00:02:57,520
Scott: And he's got this one floppy disk, but he's got nothing to do with it.

42
00:02:57,701 --> 00:02:59,579
Scott: And I have an Apple to G.S.

43
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:05,880
Scott: So I went out and I got a USB to serial cable and I got a serial to Apple to modem cable.

44
00:03:06,183 --> 00:03:07,859
Scott: And I got a program called ADT Pro.

45
00:03:08,281 --> 00:03:10,467
Scott: And I'm talking to people on the Internet's.

46
00:03:10,567 --> 00:03:15,379
Scott: and all we need now is basically I need.

47
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:25,319
Scott: I ordered on eBay 10 brand new, never opened 3M dual sided double density five and a quarter inch floppy disk.

48
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,879
Rym: The saddest thing is that at RIT, we used to when we were freshmen, wander around in the tunnels under RIT.

49
00:03:31,161 --> 00:03:33,200
Rym: And one day we were somewhere we shouldn't be.

50
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,759
Rym: And I remember we found a box full of five and a quarter floppies.

51
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:40,800
Rym: Yeah, we played with them like Frisbees for an hour and then we threw them all away.

52
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,799
Scott: If only we would have known that they were rare and no longer made.

53
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:44,362
Scott: Yes.

54
00:03:44,563 --> 00:03:46,899
Rym: Much like the box of 80 keyboards.

55
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:47,281
Scott: Yeah.

56
00:03:47,301 --> 00:03:50,260
Scott: But I won the auction for a dollar and the shipping was five dollars.

57
00:03:50,682 --> 00:03:51,639
Scott: We'll see when it shows up.

58
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,078
Scott: The person's lesson emailed me.

59
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:58,822
Rym: And I remember when I bought a box of one hundred high density, three and a half inch floppies.

60
00:03:59,103 --> 00:04:01,151
Rym: Well, it is forty five dollars.

61
00:04:01,171 --> 00:04:05,279
Scott: is the thing is I tested it out the Apple two, you know, and it totally works.

62
00:04:05,381 --> 00:04:07,320
Scott: And the cable works great and everything's awesome.

63
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:08,883
Scott: Apparently there is.

64
00:04:09,024 --> 00:04:12,380
Scott: there is a three and a half inch drive for the Apple to G.S.

65
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:22,779
Scott: I just if I could get one of those, then I could get a bunch of three and a half inch disks and I could download all sorts of Apple to software from the Web and put it on those floppies and rock the house.

66
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:24,920
Scott: But I need to get the drive.

67
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:28,057
Scott: And I so far I found one of those drives and it was on eBay for 40 bucks.

68
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:29,411
Scott: And I'm like, screw that.

69
00:04:29,471 --> 00:04:29,999
Scott: It's not worth it.

70
00:04:30,984 --> 00:04:32,099
Scott: So Apple to G.S.

71
00:04:32,261 --> 00:04:33,619
Scott: is awoken in my room.

72
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,920
Scott: The second thing I all of most of our computers.

73
00:04:37,481 --> 00:04:38,549
Scott: Right.

74
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:39,940
Rym: Oh, the twenty dollar motherboard.

75
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,123
Scott: Well, the second one.

76
00:04:41,986 --> 00:04:45,880
Scott: Basically, originally we all had Pentiums, right?

77
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,749
Scott: Like the late 90s.

78
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:47,599
Scott: I had a Pentium three.

79
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,798
Rym: I had a Pentium Pro Pro.

80
00:04:50,101 --> 00:04:50,969
Rym: Oh, man, I missed that.

81
00:04:51,231 --> 00:04:52,039
Rym: I don't miss that thing.

82
00:04:52,782 --> 00:04:53,506
Scott: And these are all.

83
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:55,800
Scott: you know, most of these were like slot based things.

84
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,161
Scott: Right.

85
00:04:56,181 --> 00:05:00,380
Scott: I mean, Rym had slot A, which is the like the first Athlons.

86
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,420
Rym: I remember I was so proud.

87
00:05:02,521 --> 00:05:06,119
Rym: I bought the AMD K seven eight hundred megahertz.

88
00:05:06,401 --> 00:05:06,662
Scott: Right.

89
00:05:06,702 --> 00:05:07,667
Scott: So I overclocked.

90
00:05:07,687 --> 00:05:09,960
Scott: that was sort of hell when we got to RIT.

91
00:05:10,502 --> 00:05:13,400
Scott: Those are the computers that most of the people brought with them.

92
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,100
Scott: I think Alex brought an old pre OS X Mac and someone else.

93
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,874
Scott: I think Greg had a K six to whatever.

94
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,520
Scott: You know, that was the first generation of the computers he brought to college.

95
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,040
Scott: We obviously had computers before that.

96
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,279
Scott: Fourty sixes and whatnot.

97
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:26,842
Rym: Yeah.

98
00:05:27,023 --> 00:05:31,719
Rym: We all kind of took turns leapfrogging each other in terms of who had the best as a computer after that.

99
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:32,321
Scott: Right.

100
00:05:32,502 --> 00:05:44,280
Scott: After those computers went away, pretty much everyone, me, Ram, Alex, Greg, Pete, everybody bought socket a machines with Athlon CPUs, Athlon XPs across the board.

101
00:05:44,401 --> 00:05:45,900
Scott: Everyone had socket a computers.

102
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,300
Scott: In fact, with AGP slots, everybody upgrade my computer.

103
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:55,799
Scott: The only reason we all had DDR four hundred or DDR three thirty three or DDR two sixty six, you know, that was the brand.

104
00:05:56,201 --> 00:06:01,679
Scott: Everyone had DDR, Ram, socket, a motherboards, Athlon, CPUs and AGP.

105
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,675
Rym: That's if I were every computer had that, if I recall, there was.

106
00:06:04,735 --> 00:06:09,580
Rym: that was right around the era where Ram got ludicrously cheap for like four or five months.

107
00:06:09,741 --> 00:06:10,960
Rym: Like Ram was so cheap.

108
00:06:11,141 --> 00:06:12,559
Rym: It was like Ram is so cheap now.

109
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:12,982
Rym: It's loud.

110
00:06:13,042 --> 00:06:13,323
Rym: I know.

111
00:06:13,384 --> 00:06:18,920
Rym: But back then, for what you got compared to what Ram had cost just a little bit before and what it cost a little bit after.

112
00:06:19,001 --> 00:06:21,679
Rym: Because remember, there was that earthquake and that Ram prices sky.

113
00:06:22,523 --> 00:06:24,740
Scott: Yeah, that earthquake was in the news for like a week.

114
00:06:24,902 --> 00:06:26,400
Scott: And then we forgot about it anyway.

115
00:06:26,642 --> 00:06:28,460
Rym: But then Ram prices were up for a while.

116
00:06:29,061 --> 00:06:33,598
Scott: And, you know, I was using that NF seven as socket, a motherboard with the XP.

117
00:06:33,658 --> 00:06:37,360
Scott: twenty five hundred up until like less than a year ago.

118
00:06:37,461 --> 00:06:39,339
Scott: And I bought my current, you know, Kortu duo.

119
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:46,957
Rym: Hey, I was doing GeekNights this show on that old Athlon slot or socket that I bought when the slot blew up.

120
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:49,279
Rym: Yeah, until when I bought that Mac.

121
00:06:49,841 --> 00:06:55,399
Scott: So as a result, you know, we all bought these new computers that have core two duos and LGA seven, seven, five.

122
00:06:55,922 --> 00:06:56,939
Scott: But we have a lot.

123
00:06:57,381 --> 00:07:01,660
Scott: All the computer equipment lying around the house, besides, you know, the Apple to G.S.

124
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:07,900
Scott: and the Mac 512 K and the I guess the Mac mini is all socket equipment.

125
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:13,980
Scott: We got lots of socket, a motherboards, lots of socket, a ram, lots of socket, a CPUs.

126
00:07:14,181 --> 00:07:15,740
Scott: I've got like four or five of them.

127
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,720
Rym: We've got nine power supplies to go.

128
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,700
Scott: I've got nine power supplies that are compatible with this.

129
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,900
Scott: You know, we have a lot of socket, a computer equipment.

130
00:07:24,121 --> 00:07:30,323
Scott: And the thing is, if you go a new egg, there are exactly two socket, a motherboards you can buy.

131
00:07:30,686 --> 00:07:32,540
Scott: One of them is like a zillion dollar.

132
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,800
Scott: It's not a zillion dollars, but it's very expensive because it's a micro.

133
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,085
Scott: It's a mini ITX.

134
00:07:37,145 --> 00:07:40,240
Scott: It's one of the ones that's meant for, you know, very tiny computers.

135
00:07:40,664 --> 00:07:41,780
Scott: So that's really not useful.

136
00:07:42,181 --> 00:07:44,940
Scott: The other one is a twenty dollar piece of crap.

137
00:07:45,621 --> 00:07:50,180
Scott: Now, I had a lot of socket equipment and I've only got one working socket, a computer.

138
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:54,140
Scott: I've got like five or six motherboards, five or six CPUs, a pile of RAM sticks.

139
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,120
Rym: Who knows which are good, which are three perfectly good ATX cases.

140
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,390
Scott: I've got cases.

141
00:07:59,511 --> 00:08:00,540
Scott: I've got power.

142
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,900
Scott: They got everything right.

143
00:08:02,401 --> 00:08:08,740
Scott: And a while back, I tried to buy a twenty dollar motherboard, a new egg, and it worked for a while and then it stopped working.

144
00:08:08,961 --> 00:08:09,866
Scott: So I was like, ah, fuck it.

145
00:08:09,926 --> 00:08:12,300
Scott: But that was I think that was a micro ATX job.

146
00:08:12,741 --> 00:08:18,547
Rym: That was because I had a micro ATX case point out that was also in that one case that always seemed to break.

147
00:08:18,567 --> 00:08:23,420
Scott: because that's the thing is the micro ATX case comes with the power supply because the regular power supply isn't going to fit in there.

148
00:08:23,902 --> 00:08:26,540
Scott: And I think that power supply was a killer anyway.

149
00:08:27,421 --> 00:08:29,519
Scott: So I said, you know what, let me try again.

150
00:08:29,802 --> 00:08:31,760
Scott: We've got one working socket, a computer.

151
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,565
Scott: It's in the hallway.

152
00:08:32,664 --> 00:08:35,200
Scott: It's like the house server for doing DNS and whatnot.

153
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:36,443
Scott: Let me try to make.

154
00:08:36,684 --> 00:08:39,260
Scott: this is my last shot at a socket, a computer that works.

155
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:40,659
Scott: So I pay 20 bucks.

156
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,919
Scott: I say, you know, even if it doesn't work, 20 bucks, big deal.

157
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,138
Scott: I won't even bother returning it.

158
00:08:45,001 --> 00:08:53,562
Scott: It kind of works, but not really doesn't work, you know, it's an it's amazing to me, and it's just too much trouble to actually make it work all the way, if such a thing is possible.

159
00:08:53,682 --> 00:09:04,599
Rym: I remember when I was a kid in high school, before I even went to RIT and I was like I'd saved up all this money and I cashed in a bunch of bonds and I was building my first computer from scratch.

160
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,380
Scott: I built your first computer from scratch with money from bonds.

161
00:09:07,522 --> 00:09:08,860
Scott: I worked for an entire summer.

162
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,558
Rym: No, I worked for that summer, too.

163
00:09:11,002 --> 00:09:12,088
Rym: I also cashed bonds.

164
00:09:12,128 --> 00:09:13,355
Scott: I actually I didn't need to get.

165
00:09:13,415 --> 00:09:14,220
Rym: I made more money.

166
00:09:14,321 --> 00:09:16,100
Rym: From that job than the computer cost.

167
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,240
Rym: The computer was four thousand dollars.

168
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,144
Rym: Yeah, but that didn't.

169
00:09:19,185 --> 00:09:22,602
Scott: when I got my first part time job, I spent basically I bought it from.

170
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:23,470
Scott: I bought a game boy and GB.

171
00:09:25,341 --> 00:09:27,119
Scott: I think it was a Game Boy Color and a bunch of games.

172
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,640
Scott: But then I didn't buy anything until I had like a thousand dollars.

173
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,363
Scott: And I bought Pentium.

174
00:09:31,444 --> 00:09:36,360
Rym: But I point out this four thousand dollars got me, among other things, a SCSI controller thousand.

175
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,420
Scott: I said one thousand.

176
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,980
Rym: Well, that included every single accessory, everything.

177
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:48,460
Scott: See, I kept the job and over I got basically got the base computer and over time bought up the accessories.

178
00:09:49,101 --> 00:09:52,519
Rym: Remember, I bought everything all at once, like right before I went to RIT.

179
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,180
Scott: But even then, not all of it together cost four thousand.

180
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,400
Scott: It might have been two thousand.

181
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,260
Rym: That included the SCSI card, the TV tuner card.

182
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,560
Scott: Oh, man, I used to buy stuff from buy dot com and then mail them checks.

183
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,021
Rym: Yeah.

184
00:10:03,463 --> 00:10:06,500
Rym: But remember, I had that Aver TV, USB.

185
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,640
Scott: Oh, that was pretty funny.

186
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,240
Rym: That thing was like one hundred and forty bucks.

187
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,380
Rym: The thing was not worth one hundred and forty dollars.

188
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,200
Scott: So the result is I sort of gave up on trying to get the twenty dollar motherboard to work.

189
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,859
Scott: I was just like after a couple of hours, I'm like, I just fuck it.

190
00:10:18,241 --> 00:10:22,723
Rym: But this is a deal made me realize, you know, I spent all this time and I built a computer.

191
00:10:23,024 --> 00:10:25,780
Rym: And then I remember thinking I have attained the skill.

192
00:10:26,302 --> 00:10:28,800
Rym: I will every few years build new computers forever.

193
00:10:29,063 --> 00:10:30,359
Rym: And like I was excited about it.

194
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:35,100
Rym: And I've built a few computers since then, but far fewer than I expected to have built.

195
00:10:35,722 --> 00:10:38,500
Scott: I built one for myself about every five years.

196
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:42,700
Scott: But in general, I built a lot or, you know, it's weird.

197
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,200
Scott: It's like I look around at how many computer parts are there.

198
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,440
Scott: And I'm like, damn, I did a lot of computer building.

199
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,485
Scott: When the hell did that happen?

200
00:10:49,505 --> 00:10:52,561
Scott: I only this is only my third computer I'm using that I've built.

201
00:10:52,702 --> 00:10:58,459
Rym: Of course, a lot of this stuff we got from side projects like Pete would upgrade and we'd have his old processor and we try to make it work.

202
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:08,140
Rym: And yeah, the thing is, all the equipment we have that isn't in a working computer was something that didn't work immediately in some other project and thus was just discarded.

203
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:15,259
Rym: because if you have three socket, a processors and one doesn't work immediately with no effort, you just toss it and grab the next one.

204
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,424
Rym: You don't think about it.

205
00:11:16,565 --> 00:11:30,079
Scott: So so I've got all this socket, a computer equipment, and I can't seem to construct a working computer out of it, even though I have theoretically enough parts to do so, assuming that one of each part is working properly.

206
00:11:30,881 --> 00:11:33,920
Scott: So I just want to get it out of the house now.

207
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:34,925
Scott: I'm done with it.

208
00:11:35,006 --> 00:11:37,580
Scott: You know, keep the socket, a computer in the hallway that's working.

209
00:11:38,102 --> 00:11:43,060
Scott: And the rest of it, I either want to sell or recycle or just get it out of the house.

210
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:50,700
Rym: Well, I think what would push Scout over the edge was the fact that you spend what I think two hours total working on that thing and it didn't work at the end of that two hours.

211
00:11:50,962 --> 00:11:52,000
Scott: Yeah, it didn't work perfectly.

212
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,060
Scott: It didn't work enough to actually be a computer that would turn on and function.

213
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:02,399
Rym: Yes, because the goal, actually, we want to we you know, we want to use one of these computers to make a Windows gaming box to run.

214
00:12:02,921 --> 00:12:09,940
Scott: And yes, that's the thing is like I most of the a lot of the parts I have, it's like if the part goes to waste, I don't care.

215
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,700
Scott: Like I had to do on nine hundreds.

216
00:12:12,163 --> 00:12:14,180
Scott: Who gives a shit if those don't get used?

217
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,300
Scott: You know, they're pretty useless.

218
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:22,056
Scott: But I've got this Geforce like 7000 series AGP eight X card.

219
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:25,280
Scott: now it's AGP, so it can't work in any modern computer.

220
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:33,720
Scott: No computer has AGP anymore, but it's a working perfectly good card that could actually play like Half-Life two games.

221
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:37,120
Scott: I just need a computer that has an AGP slot for it to go in.

222
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,240
Scott: But I don't have such a, you know, computer.

223
00:12:39,681 --> 00:12:45,280
Scott: So it's like I have this good part going to waste because I don't have other good parts for it to function with.

224
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:45,903
Scott: And I don't want to.

225
00:12:46,245 --> 00:12:49,922
Scott: if I'm going to buy a whole bunch of parts, I can, you know, go on the forum.

226
00:12:49,963 --> 00:12:53,098
Scott: I posted like an amazing machine for seven hundred dollars.

227
00:12:54,220 --> 00:13:01,620
Rym: So well, that's the thing for you know, it takes two hours of your life to get this thing working barely for seven hundred dollars.

228
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,020
Scott: I can get like a work of art for seven hundred dollars.

229
00:13:05,261 --> 00:13:08,500
Rym: You can get a computer that's like four times faster than anything.

230
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:12,059
Scott: We could get a computer faster than the ones on my desk, which is really sad.

231
00:13:12,401 --> 00:13:16,020
Rym: Yes, it's moving so quickly for less than a thousand dollars.

232
00:13:16,161 --> 00:13:22,078
Rym: I could build a computer that's almost all told twice as fast as the one I use now as my primary PC.

233
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:25,120
Rym: And I'm really tempted periodically.

234
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,500
Rym: I play I play a game like Left 4 Dead.

235
00:13:27,601 --> 00:13:30,440
Rym: And my FPS is only 40.

236
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,499
Rym: Maybe I should upgrade.

237
00:13:32,341 --> 00:13:43,440
Scott: So if anyone wants some socket, a computer equipment, if you want the small stuff like some CPUs or some ram or something like that, or if you have a use for that video card, let me know and I can mail it to you.

238
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:52,318
Scott: If you want cases, motherboards, power supplies, you know, the big stuff, you got to come here and get it because I'm not going to mail it.

239
00:13:52,941 --> 00:13:53,647
Scott: It's too big.

240
00:13:54,757 --> 00:13:55,080
Rym: All right.

241
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:04,962
Rym: So anyway, enough of that, because if you if no one wants it, we're going to donate it to some place in the Bronx or maybe we're going to find someone just to get it the hell out of the house.

242
00:14:05,042 --> 00:14:13,720
Scott: Also, if anyone wants a 12 inch VGA CRT, oh, hell, if you want a 17 inch LCD, that's perfectly fine.

243
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,744
Scott: We have extras.

244
00:14:15,407 --> 00:14:22,863
Rym: It's where I remember we bought this LCD for GeekNights to bring to conventions for, you know, like when we take the Mac and set it up on a table and record stuff.

245
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:25,000
Rym: And I remember like it was a big deal.

246
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,160
Rym: Like, yes, we should buy this.

247
00:14:26,261 --> 00:14:27,213
Rym: Let's just spend the money.

248
00:14:27,294 --> 00:14:27,679
Rym: Let's do it.

249
00:14:27,841 --> 00:14:29,819
Rym: Now we have like three LCDs we're not even using.

250
00:14:30,201 --> 00:14:30,442
Scott: Yeah.

251
00:14:31,224 --> 00:14:32,288
Rym: Times are changing.

252
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:36,102
Rym: anyway in actual tech news, because we talked about that for a while.

253
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,320
Rym: There was an article on Slashdot.

254
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:51,560
Rym: Basically, HP decided to go after this open source vendor because the open source vendor was revealing HP's, quote, confidential pricing, confidential pricing.

255
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:51,881
Rym: Yes.

256
00:14:51,922 --> 00:15:00,780
Rym: You see, HP, like pretty much every enterprise vendor out there for enterprise stuff, does not actually advertise their prices for any of their enterprise products.

257
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:08,380
Scott: Well, yeah, it's one of those situations where, you know, I mean, an enterprise thing, you know, it's understandable because there isn't really a price.

258
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:18,744
Scott: It's not like, you know, you know, this gigantic server set up costs X. It's you go and you negotiate a contract with the salespeople and they customize it to what you need.

259
00:15:18,764 --> 00:15:24,259
Rym: You think that, but we're even talking about just software, like just a ticketing system, let's say anything like that.

260
00:15:24,942 --> 00:15:26,871
Rym: It's not that there isn't a price because there is.

261
00:15:26,891 --> 00:15:28,760
Rym: there is actually just a price.

262
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:42,263
Rym: The thing is, they'll always originally always, always, always if you just ask for a price or you find a listed price, it'll be like four times what the actual secret price is.

263
00:15:42,767 --> 00:15:44,239
Rym: And what they'll do is they'll publish that.

264
00:15:44,805 --> 00:15:46,080
Rym: And I didn't realize this at first.

265
00:15:46,221 --> 00:15:52,800
Rym: When I got into the IT industry, I was young and green and I went to this company and I was like, not the company I'm talking about in the article, but some other company.

266
00:15:53,363 --> 00:15:55,040
Rym: And I was like, yeah, I'd like your software.

267
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:55,864
Rym: Can you give me a quote?

268
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:58,239
Rym: And they were like, two hundred thousand dollars.

269
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,064
Rym: I'm like, all right, fine.

270
00:16:00,105 --> 00:16:07,438
Rym: And I take that quote to my boss and my boss looks at it and he's like, demand a 70 percent discount or tell him we won't buy it.

271
00:16:08,021 --> 00:16:09,940
Rym: And I was like, that's kind of ballsy.

272
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,439
Rym: And he was like, no, that's the way it works.

273
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:11,941
Rym: Trust me.

274
00:16:12,645 --> 00:16:16,020
Rym: So I call the guy back and I'm like, listen, I need at least 70 percent off.

275
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,079
Rym: And he was like, all right.

276
00:16:19,962 --> 00:16:27,920
Rym: When it comes to this stuff, it's not that there's no price and they like fiddle it to make sure that they make the most money out of you is basically there is a price.

277
00:16:28,081 --> 00:16:33,938
Scott: But by saying this higher price first, idiots who don't know better will pay this ludicrous extra amount of money.

278
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:35,317
Scott: I guess an idiot tax.

279
00:16:35,763 --> 00:16:36,639
Rym: It's an idiot tax.

280
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:40,640
Rym: And more importantly, it's for the bean counters because I'm the tech guy.

281
00:16:41,004 --> 00:16:42,280
Rym: I know I need this software.

282
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:47,382
Rym: It's the only software in the world that does the specific ludicrous enterprise thing that I need.

283
00:16:47,985 --> 00:16:52,820
Rym: So I go to the company and they give me a quote and then I say, all right, I'll give me the other quote with the discount.

284
00:16:53,241 --> 00:17:02,975
Rym: And then I take the two quotes to my bean counter and I say, look, I saved the company seven hundred thousand dollars by negotiating this discount.

285
00:17:03,035 --> 00:17:08,119
Scott: because everything that's one thing is that at any company, IT is nothing but cost.

286
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:08,983
Scott: IT doesn't.

287
00:17:09,063 --> 00:17:13,240
Scott: unless you're a tech company, IT doesn't make you any money whatsoever.

288
00:17:13,422 --> 00:17:14,900
Scott: It's just the cost of doing business.

289
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:24,579
Scott: So thus any company that does something for reals and just has IT supporting that something for reals wants to minimize ID costs as much as possible.

290
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:25,021
Scott: So as

291
00:17:25,161 --> 00:17:47,960
Rym: an aside, I will point out that if you want to know if the company you work for is smart or not, the simplest way to find out in a hurry is to see how the management that is not technical, regards the IT, you know, computer science, whatever department, because if they regard it with disdain or they're constantly trying to cut its budget, that means that they don't understand the value it provides.

292
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,900
Scott: They've kind of fallen into that trap that if you are it's a shitty IT department that's not providing the value.

293
00:17:53,182 --> 00:17:55,039
Rym: But if that's the case, just get rid of it and outsource.

294
00:17:55,721 --> 00:17:55,942
Scott: Yep.

295
00:17:56,544 --> 00:18:05,800
Rym: But a lot of times companies, you get into this problem where if an IT department works very well, like everyone is very skilled, you will never even notice that they're there.

296
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,939
Rym: Like you won't even realize they're working like no one.

297
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,200
Rym: Nothing ever goes wrong.

298
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,659
Rym: No one thinks you're doing any work.

299
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:21,219
Rym: So bad bean counters will look at this and say, well, if nothing's ever breaking and we never see them doing any work, we should fire half of them and lower their salaries and take away those servers they're using.

300
00:18:21,987 --> 00:18:22,028
Scott: No.

301
00:18:22,272 --> 00:18:22,680
Scott: What do you know?

302
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,686
Scott: Everything's breaking.

303
00:18:24,631 --> 00:18:26,080
Scott: It just breaks all the time.

304
00:18:26,681 --> 00:18:31,400
Rym: And even when no one does anything, they always say you can tell the worth of a society by the way it treats its prisoners.

305
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:36,280
Rym: You can tell the worth of a company by the way they treat their prisoners, a.k.a.

306
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,284
Rym: the IT department.

307
00:18:37,384 --> 00:18:40,640
Rym: Yeah, but all enterprise stuff is like this.

308
00:18:40,801 --> 00:18:47,060
Rym: And this open source company, what happened here was they they got the prices, the, you know, quote unquote prices.

309
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:54,540
Scott: So they basically said they got the fake prices and said, look, this is the fake price of HP's solution.

310
00:18:54,902 --> 00:18:56,398
Scott: Our solution is open source free.

311
00:18:56,801 --> 00:18:59,300
Rym: Well, it's not open source free because they provide a solution.

312
00:18:59,501 --> 00:18:59,842
Rym: Oh, yeah.

313
00:18:59,882 --> 00:19:06,320
Scott: Well, the program is free and we provide the support for this incredibly tiny cost compared to the fake cost.

314
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:06,700
Scott: Yes.

315
00:19:06,841 --> 00:19:14,480
Rym: According to the article, what they charge is eighty two percent less than what the HP is charging.

316
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:18,460
Scott: But HP probably charges eighty two percent less than what they charge.

317
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,021
Rym: Yes.

318
00:19:19,042 --> 00:19:37,600
Rym: But the thing is the HP and the enterprise industry in general realize that if people could compare prices legitimately, if there was just a quote like I could see what another company paid, their whole house of cards comes tumbling down because this stuff does not cost that much.

319
00:19:37,741 --> 00:19:40,178
Rym: And a lot of this is markup and a lot of it's the B.S.

320
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,359
Rym: So I can say to my bean counter that I did good.

321
00:19:43,001 --> 00:19:50,319
Scott: Well, really, the big problem is that, you know, an enterprise application is something that companies desperately need.

322
00:19:51,102 --> 00:19:54,400
Scott: And but even then, you don't sell that many copies.

323
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,357
Scott: It's not like Photoshop where you sell a bajillion copies of people.

324
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,419
Scott: You sell a bajillion copies.

325
00:19:59,640 --> 00:19:59,740
Scott: Right.

326
00:19:59,761 --> 00:20:04,080
Rym: How many companies in the world will ever need software like Remedy?

327
00:20:04,721 --> 00:20:04,962
Scott: Right.

328
00:20:05,344 --> 00:20:06,850
Scott: So but, you know, it's.

329
00:20:07,131 --> 00:20:09,420
Scott: there are companies that desperately need remedy.

330
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,371
Scott: It needs to be made.

331
00:20:10,411 --> 00:20:11,100
Scott: There's a demand.

332
00:20:11,181 --> 00:20:11,889
Scott: It can be filled.

333
00:20:11,929 --> 00:20:12,880
Scott: There's money to be made.

334
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,700
Rym: Now, granted, I have my opinions.

335
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:20,840
Scott: The demand is only maybe like a hundred or a few hundred companies, maybe a few thousand.

336
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:25,140
Scott: If you're lucky, if you sell for 50 bucks, you get fifty thousand dollars.

337
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:31,679
Scott: So I hope that you made remedy with one developer in one year that you're fifty thousand dollars paid him and you broke even.

338
00:20:32,561 --> 00:20:40,560
Scott: So more and more I'm of the mind that you need to sell enterprise software for a lot more money in order to make a profit because you're not selling that many copies.

339
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:49,999
Rym: I'm feeling more and more, though, that in many cases, the cost of enterprise software is not justified compared to what it would cost to hire in-house developers to make a specific problem for you.

340
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:54,039
Scott: The problem is finding developers who are good enough because they, you know.

341
00:20:54,681 --> 00:20:54,922
Scott: Yes.

342
00:20:55,043 --> 00:20:58,120
Scott: And have the knowledge in the appropriate subject area.

343
00:20:58,681 --> 00:20:58,902
Rym: Yes.

344
00:20:58,942 --> 00:21:02,800
Rym: I mean, the example is always like hospital software or like financial software.

345
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:11,880
Rym: The subset of people who know programming and the subset of people who know complex like debt instruments or hospital stuff, there's not a lot of overlap there.

346
00:21:12,462 --> 00:21:18,520
Rym: And you're not going to find some open source guy who's like, man, you know, it's totally awesome writing accounting software for car dealerships.

347
00:21:18,641 --> 00:21:20,779
Rym: Yeah, I'm totally going to do that in my free time.

348
00:21:21,221 --> 00:21:29,360
Scott: And, you know, they if you do find someone who has that overlap, say they really know how to manage hospitals and they know how to write software really well.

349
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:30,623
Scott: Guess what?

350
00:21:30,683 --> 00:21:43,480
Scott: That person is probably just going to write that software on their own and sell it to every hospital instead of letting themselves be hired by one hospital on a salary and writing the software for one hospital and one hospital only.

351
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:56,079
Rym: But anyway, this reveals a more a wider problem in the technology world and even just the commercial world, in that there are more and more people relying on obscurity of their prices for their business models.

352
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:02,279
Rym: I mean, how many websites or retailers have rules where they don't let other people advertise their price?

353
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:12,660
Scott: I mean, how many times do you go on Amazon and it says price hidden, click here to see the actual price because they don't want like the super discounted price to be indexed anywhere on Google or anything?

354
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:12,880
Rym: Yes.

355
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:25,780
Rym: And I'm starting to feel like in the end there needs to be some sort of regulation or some sort of consumer rights that pricing information is public domain and cannot be in any way restricted.

356
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:37,200
Scott: I think that's, you know, that I think this shows just, you know, how the free flow of information and the free market are sort of inseparable.

357
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:42,320
Scott: And, you know, many people try to, you know, have one without the other or vice versa.

358
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,024
Rym: There's a lot of this.

359
00:22:43,044 --> 00:22:49,340
Scott: And it really it really I mean, look at your company is all about keeping some information secret and keeping some other information, not secret.

360
00:22:50,362 --> 00:22:54,260
Rym: Well, the thing is, that actually saves people as opposed to harming them.

361
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,480
Rym: It makes the market flow better.

362
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,564
Scott: Yeah, that's true.

363
00:22:56,905 --> 00:23:04,960
Scott: But the thing is, it's like, well, you know, this keeping this information secret saves people at HP and helps them go better.

364
00:23:05,462 --> 00:23:07,320
Rym: Yes, but there's a different I don't know.

365
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:12,419
Rym: I feel like pricing at least to get it because I could go to the very deep specifics of what my company does.

366
00:23:12,882 --> 00:23:22,979
Scott: And, you know, that is true is that at least, you know, with the stocks that, you know, your company trades stocks and whatnot, you can look up the prices of a stock just like a Google finance or whatever.

367
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:23,844
Scott: It's not secret.

368
00:23:24,106 --> 00:23:26,800
Rym: Yeah, but I feel every industry is different.

369
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,624
Rym: Everything is different.

370
00:23:27,644 --> 00:23:37,999
Rym: But in general, if someone publishes a price or someone is willing to sell something for some price and I find out what that price is, I should not be restricted in telling someone else what that price is.

371
00:23:38,561 --> 00:23:40,699
Scott: Yeah, unless you sign some sort of thing.

372
00:23:40,901 --> 00:23:41,101
Scott: Yes,

373
00:23:41,162 --> 00:24:00,120
Rym: but if I didn't and I find out a price or if a price is publicly available or in fact, if any information is publicly available and I am not bound by any sort of NDA that I have agreed to before seeing said information, then that information, it should not be illegal or against various contract laws or whatever to redistribute.

374
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:00,976
Scott: Yeah, you can't copyright.

375
00:24:01,601 --> 00:24:02,429
Scott: It's not a work.

376
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,520
Scott: It's not copyrighted.

377
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,700
Scott: It's not a logo or anything.

378
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,220
Scott: It's not a trademark, right?

379
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:10,840
Scott: It's not unless the product is not yet available or something.

380
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,360
Scott: It's not insider information.

381
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:18,985
Scott: And unless it's, you know, and it's not like the codes of the nuclear weapons, it's not a security issue.

382
00:24:19,085 --> 00:24:21,200
Rym: And it's not a heavy, heavily regulated industry.

383
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:26,399
Rym: Like part of the reason why stocks are so different is that there is a very heavy handed government presence in stock.

384
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:26,841
Scott: Yeah.

385
00:24:26,961 --> 00:24:33,778
Scott: So if there's none of those things that we just listed, then any piece of information should be allowed to be freely disseminated.

386
00:24:34,643 --> 00:24:35,393
Scott: It's freedom of the press.

387
00:24:35,413 --> 00:24:35,919
Scott: That's how it works.

388
00:24:36,202 --> 00:24:36,444
Rym: Yes.

389
00:24:36,947 --> 00:24:38,620
Rym: So that's all I really have to say about that.

390
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:42,400
Rym: It's one of those situations where I brought up the article just to discuss the topic.

391
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:47,740
Rym: But all I have to say is I went to my boss and I was like, I got a 70 percent discount.

392
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:53,039
Rym: He was like, good job, because he knows that it's so great working for a company where everyone knows better.

393
00:24:53,881 --> 00:24:54,289
Scott: Yeah.

394
00:24:54,615 --> 00:24:54,819
Scott: Yeah.

395
00:24:55,482 --> 00:24:56,779
Scott: Other bosses might be like, really?

396
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:57,703
Scott: So we should.

397
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:00,660
Rym: Of course, I didn't realize until later.

398
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,839
Rym: But when I worked at the hospital, I was on the opposite side of that.

399
00:25:04,891 --> 00:25:06,140
Rym: I just never did the negotiating.

400
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:06,926
Rym: So I never knew.

401
00:25:06,946 --> 00:25:08,279
Rym: I never realized.

402
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,206
Scott: Anyway, so check that.

403
00:25:10,226 --> 00:25:11,540
Scott: This is a really interesting story.

404
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:23,839
Scott: I thought people, when they think of robots, you know, fighting in wars or anything like that, they think of, you know, science fiction, doomsday robots killing everyone with laser beams.

405
00:25:25,246 --> 00:25:26,599
Scott: You know, I think all the humans.

406
00:25:26,842 --> 00:25:27,208
Scott: Exactly.

407
00:25:27,228 --> 00:25:27,980
Scott: I think about the Matrix.

408
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,540
Scott: They think about all that sort of stuff.

409
00:25:29,821 --> 00:25:32,579
Scott: And with very good reason, they think about those things.

410
00:25:33,202 --> 00:25:37,020
Rym: However, because robots have such a long, colorful history of killing us.

411
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,420
Scott: Of course, you know, even Astro voice talking about this kind of action.

412
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:49,125
Scott: But there's actually, you know, people are, of course, you know, that military is researching everything.

413
00:25:49,165 --> 00:25:52,603
Scott: And of course, they're researching autonomous battlefield robots.

414
00:25:52,924 --> 00:25:56,460
Scott: It's not, you know, we have the technology to do something in this area.

415
00:25:56,661 --> 00:26:00,800
Rym: As far as I am aware, no doctrine of U.S.

416
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,140
Rym: military strategy has changed.

417
00:26:02,281 --> 00:26:06,860
Rym: I believe now I'm talking based largely on things I read a long time ago.

418
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:15,680
Rym: But as far as I'm aware, the doctrine of our military is that regardless of what electronic systems are in place, a human must always make the kill decision.

419
00:26:15,942 --> 00:26:16,628
Rym: Yeah.

420
00:26:16,709 --> 00:26:17,759
Scott: I think that's how it is now.

421
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:21,940
Rym: Well, that's kind of like currently the universal doctrine of automatic killing.

422
00:26:22,321 --> 00:26:22,462
Scott: Yeah.

423
00:26:22,482 --> 00:26:27,442
Scott: We've got, you know, we've got robot drones that fly, but they don't drop bombs or anything.

424
00:26:27,462 --> 00:26:33,080
Scott: And if they do, someone else is is looking at like a camera and pushing a button that drops the bomb, you know, whatever like that.

425
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,720
Rym: A human always makes the decision to engage a lethal device.

426
00:26:37,101 --> 00:26:42,124
Scott: But what's interesting here is that normally people would go, ah, it's give you the matrix.

427
00:26:42,145 --> 00:26:42,730
Scott: Don't do that.

428
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:44,000
Scott: Don't make killing robots.

429
00:26:44,421 --> 00:26:51,543
Scott: But actually, there are some things that are actually better about robots being in wars than people.

430
00:26:51,664 --> 00:26:57,240
Scott: You know, take, for example, a person, you know, in, you know, a battlefield situation.

431
00:26:57,961 --> 00:26:58,865
Scott: They're afraid.

432
00:26:59,327 --> 00:27:00,411
Scott: They're you know, they're.

433
00:27:00,632 --> 00:27:07,820
Scott: they're very paranoid that, you know, every person they see, especially like an Iraq kind of situation, you know, is is actually like a crazy suicide bomber.

434
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,400
Rym: It's a concept I actually was unaware of.

435
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:14,660
Rym: And I read a fascinating couple of articles about it, but it was situational.

436
00:27:15,102 --> 00:27:16,020
Rym: I forgot what the term was.

437
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:19,280
Rym: I feel like it says here, scenario fulfillment, scenario fulfillment.

438
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:19,962
Rym: That's the one.

439
00:27:20,464 --> 00:27:36,180
Rym: It's this whole idea that if someone expects a certain outcome based on their training or their life experience, even if the situation they're in will not necessarily lead to that outcome, they will take action subconsciously to cause that outcome to occur anyway.

440
00:27:36,801 --> 00:27:47,960
Scott: Well, actually, what it is, is that if you let's say you think that, you know, a suicide bombing is going to happen, right, as you expect.

441
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:48,441
Scott: Right.

442
00:27:48,461 --> 00:28:08,937
Scott: So you look around you and you know, you basically anything around you that may hint at a suicide bombing, perhaps a guy with a trench coat or, you know, those pieces of information, you know, the guy with the trench coat, a guy, you know, winking at some people, you know, stuff like that, that information, those things.

443
00:28:08,977 --> 00:28:14,899
Scott: you will observe those things and they will stick in your mind and you will notice the more and you will notice other things less.

444
00:28:15,482 --> 00:28:18,380
Scott: And that's now, you know, you expect a thing to happen.

445
00:28:18,882 --> 00:28:21,999
Scott: And now everything you see makes it look like that's going to happen.

446
00:28:22,663 --> 00:28:24,079
Scott: It's like, oh, my God, it is going to happen.

447
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:34,681
Scott: You know, because you expected it to happen, your your brain sort of sees it coming and turns everything around you into hints of it coming and ignores everything else is going on.

448
00:28:35,364 --> 00:28:40,141
Scott: And thus, you know, people are very likely to get panicky and make all sorts of mistakes.

449
00:28:40,202 --> 00:28:40,583
Scott: Whereas

450
00:28:41,164 --> 00:28:42,689
Rym: a robot, while

451
00:28:42,829 --> 00:28:45,657
Scott: it if you had some evil Terminator style,

452
00:28:45,677 --> 00:28:56,454
Rym: I, you know, or if you run into the as a mob problem where, you know, you make the very specific rules, but then there's the one condition that doesn't really jive with the rules and then horrible things happen.

453
00:28:56,637 --> 00:28:56,799
Scott: Right.

454
00:28:57,741 --> 00:28:59,308
Scott: But the robot doesn't have these.

455
00:28:59,348 --> 00:29:05,160
Scott: robot isn't going to like panic and, you know, just start shooting like crazy unless it's broken and it's got a bug in it.

456
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,387
Scott: You know, it doesn't.

457
00:29:06,729 --> 00:29:08,660
Scott: it's not afraid of things it does.

458
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,006
Scott: It doesn't.

459
00:29:10,126 --> 00:29:22,320
Scott: Well, I guess the theoretical idea is that simply it doesn't have all sorts of nasty, like, you know, human problems of like going crazy in Vietnam and becoming a human can be programmed by training.

460
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:27,722
Rym: But at the same time, humans, all humans, ourselves included, believe it or not, are fallible.

461
00:29:28,223 --> 00:29:34,103
Rym: And you can't program a human to behave in a specific way 100 percent because we're human.

462
00:29:34,143 --> 00:29:40,160
Rym: If you could program a human that way, then that kind of belies our ability to choose and think and all sorts of things.

463
00:29:40,622 --> 00:29:42,760
Rym: But humans can react in irrational ways.

464
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,543
Rym: They can be frightened.

465
00:29:43,584 --> 00:29:51,840
Rym: And theoretically, you can program a robot so long as you have a sufficient means to program it effectively to always behave in a specific way.

466
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:57,586
Rym: So a robot, if you train it and you train it properly, will always behave exactly the way you trained it.

467
00:29:57,606 --> 00:29:59,080
Rym: It will never deviate from this course.

468
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:11,640
Rym: So say you had a century robot that's guarding a checkpoint and it is instructed to, you know, give five warnings if someone approaches without identifying themselves and it gives those warnings in various different languages.

469
00:30:12,102 --> 00:30:27,140
Rym: And it only shoots if the specific final threshold is reached and the specific number of warnings has been given, as opposed to a human who, if they see a jeep driving at them quickly, might fire on it before they realize that behind that jeep, there's something else going on or the jeep is trying to slow down.

470
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:37,244
Scott: Or maybe their friends are driving the jeep and they stole it, you know, and even though it's a disguised jeep, you know, who know, you know, it makes all sorts of mistakes and they properly.

471
00:30:37,566 --> 00:30:39,740
Scott: But there's other advantages to a robot as well.

472
00:30:39,841 --> 00:30:41,920
Scott: For example, you know, there's a robot.

473
00:30:43,062 --> 00:30:51,820
Scott: You can't really capture it and make it a prisoner of war, it doesn't really work, you can't interrogate it and someone can always self-destruct it, you know, from far away.

474
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,085
Rym: Of course, there is still the.

475
00:30:53,427 --> 00:31:06,473
Rym: the primary ethical concern I've always found with autonomous killing machines or even remote killing machines is that it removes all of the kind of danger or immediacy of warfare from the person engaging in it.

476
00:31:07,015 --> 00:31:14,720
Scott: so that also if we ever reach a point where it's robots fighting robots, it really becomes like, why?

477
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:22,119
Scott: Yeah, just if you're basically having a fight of money and science, you might as well just play a game at that point.

478
00:31:22,461 --> 00:31:23,460
Scott: Well, we should do anyway.

479
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:23,702
Rym: Yes.

480
00:31:23,722 --> 00:31:25,620
Rym: Well, Europe turned to soccer a long time ago.

481
00:31:26,001 --> 00:31:26,204
Rym: I know.

482
00:31:26,224 --> 00:31:27,160
Rym: They're well for them.

483
00:31:27,281 --> 00:31:27,625
Rym: Yes.

484
00:31:27,645 --> 00:31:28,919
Scott: I need robot soccer.

485
00:31:29,481 --> 00:31:37,640
Rym: But there's also the problem that I mean, imagine, you know, occupying Iraq or occupying a country, a war, an aggressive war against an enemy state.

486
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:41,560
Rym: Currently, people from our side, you know, your side will die.

487
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,529
Rym: There'll be casualties.

488
00:31:42,549 --> 00:31:43,520
Rym: There will be consequences.

489
00:31:43,741 --> 00:31:57,480
Rym: But if you can, if you could eventually wage an occupying war solely with autonomous machines, then the only danger to a state that is belligerent is economic and no longer there are no longer lives on the line.

490
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:15,059
Rym: And that, in a way, if a society isn't prepared to be much more discerning in when it engages war, it kind of removes one of the natural checks and balances of the world that even if you go to war for a good reason or a bad reason, war hurts and it forces you to think about it at least a little bit.

491
00:32:15,581 --> 00:32:21,857
Rym: If you remove that check, you either need a much more enlightened society or you need to just not engage in warfare at all.

492
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:22,742
Rym: Yeah.

493
00:32:22,762 --> 00:32:25,080
Rym: Maybe at that point you shouldn't have the automatic killing machines.

494
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:25,862
Scott: Probably not.

495
00:32:25,983 --> 00:32:34,863
Scott: But it's interesting, though, because usually, you know, the first thing people think of when they think of war robots is, you know, the Terminator, the Matrix or anything like that.

496
00:32:34,983 --> 00:32:45,040
Scott: And for someone to come out and make a pretty decent argument for why they're probably, you know, should be, you know, robotic soldiers of, you know, some kind.

497
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,720
Scott: That's, you know, it's pretty interesting.

498
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:55,923
Rym: Well, I remember reading and this was a good 12 to 15 years ago, I remember reading an article about a system that had been designed and actually they've come a long way since then.

499
00:32:56,288 --> 00:32:57,180
Rym: I got to see what the state is.

500
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:00,516
Rym: I'm sure there's an article about it, but it was a machine that was designed to.

501
00:33:01,259 --> 00:33:02,979
Rym: it has microphones placed all over the place.

502
00:33:03,661 --> 00:33:04,163
Rym: And it'll.

503
00:33:04,404 --> 00:33:10,239
Rym: if a gunshot is fired, it could pinpoint in less than a second exactly where that gunshot originated from.

504
00:33:11,042 --> 00:33:34,240
Rym: So in a combat zone or in a peacekeeping situation, if the technology were sufficient, like an example of one of these machines could be a robot that identifies and then, if necessary, fires upon any combatant anywhere in a zone, thus denying the ability to engage in hostilities to anyone within a certain zone, which is a very interesting peacekeeping idea.

505
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:40,600
Scott: That would be a very good idea, except that things like walls exist, which is a problem.

506
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,431
Rym: Well, yes, but at the same time, the gunshot could.

507
00:33:43,471 --> 00:33:48,419
Rym: if the gunshot originated behind the wall, I don't need to worry about the gunshot hitting anything.

508
00:33:49,221 --> 00:33:57,783
Scott: Well, no, but like, for example, this machine that has the microphones and, say, a sniper rifle in it is on the other side of the wall, I kill someone on this side of the wall.

509
00:33:58,448 --> 00:33:59,740
Scott: The machine doesn't kill me.

510
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,623
Scott: I'm OK.

511
00:34:00,683 --> 00:34:04,780
Rym: It's got all area denial devices only deny a specific area.

512
00:34:05,282 --> 00:34:07,720
Rym: I mean, I have a mind, so I buried somewhere.

513
00:34:08,143 --> 00:34:09,540
Rym: Someone might walk around the mine.

514
00:34:10,702 --> 00:34:11,125
Scott: That's right.

515
00:34:11,145 --> 00:34:13,219
Rym: OK, we shouldn't use mines anyway.

516
00:34:13,661 --> 00:34:28,679
Scott: I just think that to conclude this news bit here, I think that this just demonstrates that the perfect soldier is, of course, some sort of cyborg, twisted half man, half machine, as everyone has always known, some sort of abomination.

517
00:34:28,841 --> 00:34:31,571
Rym: Yes, that is a God and country that is.

518
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:33,918
Scott: that is obvious for a very long time.

519
00:34:34,402 --> 00:34:36,159
Scott: This is just more more on the part.

520
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:53,202
Rym: In fact, I think it must essentially live entirely within the uncanny valley, perhaps at the deepest trough, some combination of Gogo 13 and Johnny 5.

521
00:34:53,202 --> 00:34:59,300
Rym: But anyway, things of the day, I stumbled across this kind of randomly and I think it's pretty damn cool.

522
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,200
Rym: I don't know who this guy is.

523
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:06,504
Rym: I didn't do any research on this whatsoever other than watching this video and a couple of related videos.

524
00:35:06,544 --> 00:35:32,820
Rym: But this guy has a looks like they have a research team and they've come up with a very low impact, very low technology, very efficient and very fascinating way to regreen and reclaim land that has been lost to desert, particularly in the Middle East, and turn it into useful cropland without having to divert any water from anywhere else or any substantial resources from anywhere else.

525
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:38,200
Scott: So that's pretty it because, you know, isn't the definition of desert like a place with less than X rainfall?

526
00:35:38,825 --> 00:35:39,780
Rym: Yeah, but there's more to it.

527
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,420
Scott: Where does where does you need?

528
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:45,400
Scott: I mean, you need water and you need a certain amount of it, you know, no matter what.

529
00:35:45,561 --> 00:35:45,823
Scott: Right.

530
00:35:45,883 --> 00:35:48,260
Scott: I mean, you can't just suddenly if they can magically grow.

531
00:35:48,443 --> 00:35:49,480
Scott: Trees with no water.

532
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,405
Scott: Holy crap.

533
00:35:50,547 --> 00:35:51,920
Scott: Nobel prizes all around.

534
00:35:52,061 --> 00:35:52,283
Scott: Right.

535
00:35:52,363 --> 00:35:54,440
Scott: So they got to get the water from somewhere.

536
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:54,621
Scott: Yes.

537
00:35:54,641 --> 00:36:01,820
Rym: Well, the idea is that even in the harsh deserts where there is very little rainfall, there is still enough rainfall.

538
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:07,284
Rym: The problem is what little rainfall there is either evaporates immediately or hits the soil.

539
00:36:07,324 --> 00:36:08,859
Rym: that won't absorb it and it washes away.

540
00:36:09,021 --> 00:36:09,489
Rym: That's why.

541
00:36:09,673 --> 00:36:10,039
Scott: So why?

542
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:14,947
Scott: But I mean, like I was in the desert and I spilled some water and it absorbed into the sandy dirt.

543
00:36:15,472 --> 00:36:16,340
Rym: Yes, the sandy dirt.

544
00:36:16,521 --> 00:36:22,059
Rym: So if you poured a ton of water, it would absorb all it could absorb at the surface and the rest of it just washes away.

545
00:36:23,062 --> 00:36:26,340
Rym: And two, that's why you get these flash floods in desert places so often.

546
00:36:26,921 --> 00:36:33,658
Scott: And beyond that, the soil itself, because when it actually does rain, very little of it goes into the soil and the rest of it goes whoosh.

547
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,041
Rym: Yep.

548
00:36:34,121 --> 00:36:40,139
Rym: And if only and if there's only a little bit in the soil, like you just spill your water, it's going to evaporate out of the soil like that.

549
00:36:40,441 --> 00:36:41,419
Scott: And because it's very hot.

550
00:36:41,921 --> 00:36:50,420
Rym: So they came up with this interesting way of kind of using the contours of the land and just like mulching and making these these troughs that will catch water.

551
00:36:50,961 --> 00:36:59,240
Rym: And the very little rainfall there is, if you just catch it properly, is enough to grow a whole ton of fig trees and citrus trees and mushrooms and all sorts of neat stuff.

552
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,059
Rym: I suggest you all watch this video.

553
00:37:02,701 --> 00:37:05,133
Rym: I'm going to try to do some more research and see the.

554
00:37:05,355 --> 00:37:07,819
Rym: you know what the results of this event and how feasible it is.

555
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,720
Rym: But this is fascinating stuff.

556
00:37:10,122 --> 00:37:18,060
Rym: I always like because, you know, people always tend to focus, especially on, you know, tech shows and podcasts in the Western world on the very high tech solutions to things.

557
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:22,362
Rym: So what's the cutting edge, the bleeding edge of, you know, every science, every technology.

558
00:37:22,382 --> 00:37:29,960
Rym: But at the same time, the bleeding edge and the cutting edge often take a lot more resources and require a lot more infrastructure.

559
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:41,680
Rym: I mean, a device that could, by cranking it, purify water, even if it was very inefficient, would do a lot more good to poor parts of Africa than even the fanciest modern osmosis device.

560
00:37:41,901 --> 00:37:44,819
Scott: Yeah, there are plenty of water filtering things going down there.

561
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:51,980
Rym: Yes, but that's a good example that the things that help the third world the most are often the very robust, low tech solutions.

562
00:37:52,160 --> 00:38:20,259
Rym: I call this the AK-47 syndrome, that a low tech but very well constructed, very easy to use, very easy to manufacture, requiring very little preexisting knowledge solution is generally much better for helping people who don't have a lot of resources at their disposal to kind of take control of their own destiny and help themselves rather than forcing them to rely on technology they could never understand because they don't have the infrastructure or the education already to use it.

563
00:38:21,723 --> 00:38:23,420
Rym: And I just I love solutions like this.

564
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:24,465
Rym: So I hope this.

565
00:38:25,088 --> 00:38:27,240
Rym: I hope that we see more things like this in the future.

566
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:32,088
Rym: And I think that this is really the the the way we should be going in terms of helping the third world.

567
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:33,340
Scott: I mean, it looks like it works.

568
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:36,880
Scott: I just question whether, you know, you can't do this to all the desert.

569
00:38:37,041 --> 00:38:40,720
Scott: You know, you're only going to be able to do this so much before it doesn't work anymore.

570
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:41,641
Rym: I see.

571
00:38:41,882 --> 00:38:47,199
Rym: It seems like the places this is most useful are marginalized people who are living on the edges of deserts.

572
00:38:47,421 --> 00:38:52,620
Rym: And I mean, there are a lot of parts of the Middle East where people are living in places that people really shouldn't be living.

573
00:38:52,721 --> 00:38:53,775
Rym: But that's all they've got.

574
00:38:54,581 --> 00:38:54,803
Rym: Yeah.

575
00:38:54,823 --> 00:39:01,040
Scott: So for those people, I mean, think about it, you know, for years and years and years, all desert people like Bedouins were all nomadic.

576
00:39:01,181 --> 00:39:03,454
Scott: They moved around and then they'd be.

577
00:39:03,494 --> 00:39:04,420
Scott: oasis is right.

578
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:08,660
Scott: So it's like you got a desert, but you have an oasis and an oasis is like a real thing.

579
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:09,848
Scott: It's not just in the cartoons.

580
00:39:09,868 --> 00:39:11,660
Scott: They exist very much, you know.

581
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:14,631
Scott: And it's like if there's an oasis, why can't the?

582
00:39:14,651 --> 00:39:18,059
Scott: you know, if that can exist, why can't the oasis be bigger?

583
00:39:18,582 --> 00:39:20,879
Rym: And part of I mean, why is there an oasis here?

584
00:39:21,441 --> 00:39:23,559
Scott: Why can't there be an oasis two feet next to it?

585
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,062
Scott: What

586
00:39:24,082 --> 00:39:53,463
Rym: part of the problem is that, you know, the Western world and the modern world, we advance and we go to these third world places where there's not a lot of existing infrastructure and we use our known existing solutions that while they work great in our industrialized societies, they rely so much on like petrochemical industry and, you know, steady streams, electricity and highly skilled manpower that they just they don't work in areas where that infrastructure doesn't exist and building that infrastructure out of nothing would be a gigantic catastrophe for a lot of reasons that I'm not going to get into.

587
00:39:54,532 --> 00:39:55,420
Rym: So I think this is neat.

588
00:39:55,820 --> 00:40:00,422
Rym: I don't want to spend more time on it now, but watch this video and it's a video is pretty yeah.

589
00:40:00,462 --> 00:40:03,884
Scott: But once you sort of got to watch it for a minute before you figure out what's going on.

590
00:40:03,905 --> 00:40:04,880
Rym: Yeah, the audio is good.

591
00:40:05,322 --> 00:40:07,480
Scott: The slideshow is kind of the guy's a funny voice.

592
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,448
Scott: Yes, he does.

593
00:40:08,892 --> 00:40:09,799
Rym: He's got a big chin, too.

594
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:10,802
Scott: All right.

595
00:40:10,822 --> 00:40:15,903
Scott: So my thing of the day, I don't know how many people know about like RSA secure IDs.

596
00:40:15,983 --> 00:40:17,993
Scott: Basically, the way they work is it's a little.

597
00:40:18,294 --> 00:40:26,634
Scott: it's a little thing you put on your key chain and has an LCD screen and a battery and it generates a different random number everyone like 60 seconds, something like every minute, every.

598
00:40:26,814 --> 00:40:28,503
Rym: it's like every six to 10 seconds, I think.

599
00:40:29,207 --> 00:40:31,600
Scott: Anyway, you just you look at it and there's a number on it, right?

600
00:40:32,063 --> 00:40:33,311
Scott: And you have a server somewhere.

601
00:40:33,331 --> 00:40:34,580
Scott: you have to buy this server.

602
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:37,440
Scott: It's the expensive RSA like verification server.

603
00:40:38,122 --> 00:40:40,580
Scott: And that also has numbers in it.

604
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:40,881
Scott: Right.

605
00:40:40,922 --> 00:40:41,907
Scott: And they're there to.

606
00:40:42,028 --> 00:40:45,084
Scott: basically you have a little computer and a big computer both generating numbers.

607
00:40:45,124 --> 00:40:57,280
Rym: They rely on precise timing and known seeds for random number generators so that whatever number is showing up on my completely separated key chain, the exact same number is ready for me and me alone to log into the server.

608
00:40:57,561 --> 00:40:57,762
Scott: Right.

609
00:40:57,943 --> 00:41:01,060
Scott: So I want to connect to my works server from home.

610
00:41:01,404 --> 00:41:02,640
Scott: I look at my little key chain.

611
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,359
Scott: I type the number in and I push enter.

612
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,420
Scott: No, I also type in my name and password.

613
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:13,200
Rym: Well, now what you do is you type in a pin that is known only to you, something you know, and you type in the number on the key fob, something you have.

614
00:41:13,802 --> 00:41:16,460
Rym: And then the two of those together, you know, two factor authentication.

615
00:41:17,103 --> 00:41:18,799
Rym: It is incredibly secure.

616
00:41:19,401 --> 00:41:20,228
Scott: Yeah, it's it's.

617
00:41:20,288 --> 00:41:21,720
Scott: it's like your ATM card, you know.

618
00:41:22,201 --> 00:41:23,559
Scott: Oh, someone knows my PIN number.

619
00:41:23,701 --> 00:41:24,689
Scott: They don't have my card.

620
00:41:25,153 --> 00:41:26,040
Scott: Someone has my card.

621
00:41:26,122 --> 00:41:27,038
Scott: They don't know my PIN number.

622
00:41:27,221 --> 00:41:30,580
Scott: Of course, something you have and something, you know, is like the ultimate insecurity.

623
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:35,858
Rym: I mean, well, the only thing on that is the the extension of something you have, which is something you are, you know, a.k.a.

624
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:36,586
Rym: biometrics.

625
00:41:36,647 --> 00:41:37,177
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

626
00:41:37,701 --> 00:41:46,179
Scott: But, you know, something you have something, you know, is fucking secure as long as the something you have isn't easily duplicated, like, say, a key like a physical key.

627
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:46,662
Rym: Yes.

628
00:41:46,802 --> 00:41:50,665
Rym: Or or in spy movies, you cut off the spy's finger, then you press it against the thing.

629
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:51,113
Rym: Right.

630
00:41:51,215 --> 00:41:51,399
Scott: Right.

631
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,580
Scott: But an RSA key, unless a guy steals it from you, it even he does steal it from you.

632
00:41:56,024 --> 00:41:57,539
Scott: He needs to know something he doesn't.

633
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:58,466
Rym: He has to know two things.

634
00:41:58,991 --> 00:42:00,020
Scott: The key to your house.

635
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,439
Scott: He can open your house if he doesn't know your address.

636
00:42:03,202 --> 00:42:03,805
Scott: He might know you're.

637
00:42:04,046 --> 00:42:07,083
Rym: that's why people say you should never put your address on your key.

638
00:42:07,144 --> 00:42:08,400
Scott: Well, definitely shouldn't do that.

639
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,599
Scott: That's that's just fucking stupid.

640
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,557
Rym: That's like putting your your PIN number.

641
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,820
Rym: I actually don't like your number.

642
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:18,020
Scott: You actually don't like how car keys sort of identify what kind of car they go with.

643
00:42:18,644 --> 00:42:19,879
Scott: You know, it should just be a key.

644
00:42:20,181 --> 00:42:22,419
Scott: It shouldn't have like, you know, a Ford logo on it.

645
00:42:22,641 --> 00:42:30,323
Rym: Of course, we don't need to talk about the fact that all locks are, according to the Internet and a lot of study, trivially breakable and open by anyone who knows anything.

646
00:42:30,785 --> 00:42:35,960
Scott: But anyway, there's a. there's a company called Yubico and I think they're a Swedish company.

647
00:42:36,101 --> 00:42:36,382
Scott: Right.

648
00:42:36,964 --> 00:42:37,185
Scott: Yeah.

649
00:42:37,446 --> 00:42:40,339
Scott: And they made a thing called the Yubikey.

650
00:42:40,801 --> 00:42:42,212
Scott: And you can just buy it.

651
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:43,180
Scott: You can buy these.

652
00:42:43,642 --> 00:42:46,420
Scott: And I want to try to get 10 people to buy them.

653
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:48,999
Scott: That way I can get the price down by five bucks per key.

654
00:42:49,781 --> 00:42:52,259
Scott: Basically, what this is is a lot like the RSA key.

655
00:42:52,764 --> 00:42:53,312
Scott: Only better.

656
00:42:53,332 --> 00:42:53,799
Scott: Right.

657
00:42:54,481 --> 00:42:58,979
Scott: And how it works is it's a USB thingy.

658
00:42:59,160 --> 00:42:59,301
Scott: Right.

659
00:42:59,321 --> 00:43:03,625
Scott: So you put it in the USB slot and it has one button on it and you push the button instead.

660
00:43:03,645 --> 00:43:06,980
Scott: And so you look at it and there's no like LCD screen on it.

661
00:43:07,382 --> 00:43:10,100
Scott: So it doesn't need a battery like the RSA key does.

662
00:43:10,644 --> 00:43:11,614
Scott: It's a lot smaller.

663
00:43:11,997 --> 00:43:12,220
Scott: Right.

664
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:20,837
Scott: And basically you push the button and when you push the button, it's actually USB keyboard and it types in this number.

665
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:29,620
Scott: So if you open up your text editor and you push the button a few times, you'll see it type in these numbers every time you push the button.

666
00:43:30,261 --> 00:43:34,364
Scott: And it's, you know, it's sort of like a one time pad, you know, sort of reading itself off.

667
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:37,600
Rym: Yes, I'll admit neither one of us has read like the white papers.

668
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:39,400
Scott: Yeah, it's not perfect.

669
00:43:39,501 --> 00:43:41,379
Scott: I got to I got to read exactly how this works.

670
00:43:41,561 --> 00:43:45,902
Scott: But, you know, I'm just doing it as a thing of the day for now, because we're very interested.

671
00:43:46,003 --> 00:43:52,240
Rym: And believe me, once if we decide to buy these and we actually start using them or something, there will be a whole show dedicated to these.

672
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:52,741
Scott: Yeah.

673
00:43:52,761 --> 00:43:56,122
Scott: This is security now episode actually about it, too, where they talk to the person.

674
00:43:56,182 --> 00:43:56,363
Scott: Yes.

675
00:43:56,424 --> 00:44:01,779
Rym: If you want to if you want to find out our opinions on how secure they are, just listen to that security now, which we haven't listened to.

676
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:02,162
Rym: Right.

677
00:44:02,182 --> 00:44:04,279
Rym: Because we'll just parrot whatever it says for the most part.

678
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:05,823
Scott: Probably.

679
00:44:06,725 --> 00:44:18,185
Scott: So basically the way this works is you go to, say, you know, a website and you type in your username, you push this button and you're signed in as long as the website supports Yubikey.

680
00:44:18,245 --> 00:44:22,019
Scott: Now, the thing is they somebody made a Yubikey open I.D.

681
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:22,622
Scott: thingy.

682
00:44:22,682 --> 00:44:25,919
Scott: So any website you can use the Yubikey to log into open I.D.

683
00:44:26,201 --> 00:44:27,631
Scott: and then use the open I.D.

684
00:44:27,651 --> 00:44:28,880
Scott: to log into a site.

685
00:44:29,581 --> 00:44:37,900
Scott: And they've also got it going with SSH and they've got it going with PAM, which means you can log into a Linux machine with it, you know, and it's pretty good stuff.

686
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:45,031
Scott: Now, the best part about this right is you buy these little keys, which are twenty five dollars, but it's twenty dollars if you order more.

687
00:44:45,071 --> 00:44:49,591
Scott: this discount pricing for bulk orders and RSA.

688
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:55,059
Scott: If you want to buy RSA keys, you got to pay for the keys.

689
00:44:55,544 --> 00:44:56,600
Scott: You got to pay for the server.

690
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,240
Scott: The server is like a bajillion dollars or you can't afford that.

691
00:44:59,280 --> 00:44:59,622
Scott: It's got.

692
00:44:59,703 --> 00:45:02,860
Scott: you know, you need to get this even with the 70 percent enterprise discount.

693
00:45:03,464 --> 00:45:04,340
Scott: It's still too much money.

694
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:05,223
Rym: I'll sum this up.

695
00:45:05,725 --> 00:45:14,539
Rym: Open source people will jump all over this most likely and you will be able to implement something that is very likely almost or as secure as RSA secure I.D.

696
00:45:15,423 --> 00:45:17,760
Rym: on your own for very little money.

697
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:21,820
Scott: Actually, the server they've written it, the company that makes the keys wrote the server.

698
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:22,684
Scott: It's open source.

699
00:45:22,764 --> 00:45:23,367
Scott: It's already.

700
00:45:23,468 --> 00:45:29,160
Scott: you can just go and get it and work with it and, you know, sort of make, you know, anything you want work with Yubikey.

701
00:45:29,341 --> 00:45:34,120
Scott: So it's just a matter of time for for more people to make it work with more things.

702
00:45:34,241 --> 00:45:36,498
Scott: And even if it just works with open I.D.

703
00:45:37,321 --> 00:45:44,219
Scott: and, you know, your Linux machines, that's enough to make it worth it, to make those things super secure.

704
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:50,220
Scott: Hells yeah, it is something to keep an eye on, especially if you're really concerned about security.

705
00:45:50,341 --> 00:45:54,940
Scott: And because it's just a USB keyboard, it can work with any computer that has USB.

706
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:55,980
Scott: It doesn't freaking matter.

707
00:45:56,061 --> 00:45:57,819
Scott: You don't need any special software or anything.

708
00:45:58,101 --> 00:46:00,080
Rym: Scott, you got to get it to work on the Apple two GS.

709
00:46:00,726 --> 00:46:01,438
Scott: It doesn't have USB.

710
00:46:02,283 --> 00:46:02,939
Rym: Make a dongle.

711
00:46:03,883 --> 00:46:04,746
Scott: I guess I can.

712
00:46:04,766 --> 00:46:05,147
Scott: I have.

713
00:46:05,448 --> 00:46:08,820
Scott: I have the USB to serial to Apple to modem port cable.

714
00:46:09,022 --> 00:46:10,599
Scott: I guess maybe it would work.

715
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,920
Rym: Maybe you could use that analog game controller port.

716
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:16,013
Scott: I know because it wouldn't power it wouldn't.

717
00:46:16,093 --> 00:46:17,700
Scott: it wouldn't work anyway.

718
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:21,577
Rym: So you might have noticed we went longer than usual for the whole show.

719
00:46:21,657 --> 00:46:28,340
Rym: up to this point, because I guess it's you know, now that we have this half schedule, we had a lot of tech news and a lot of things in the day and things queued up.

720
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:35,559
Rym: So basically we got to this point where every topic we brought up was something we all have a lot to say about prior whole shows worth of stuff to say about.

721
00:46:36,202 --> 00:46:38,680
Scott: So it's funny how that sort of happens unintentionally.

722
00:46:39,401 --> 00:46:46,659
Rym: You know, it's good in a way, though, because it's not like the old days where we'd be scraping the bottom of the barrel for the Monday News every week.

723
00:46:48,782 --> 00:46:50,060
Rym: We've been reading science articles.

724
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,220
Rym: We have no idea what they're about.

725
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:52,640
Rym: Like, yeah, this is awesome.

726
00:46:53,661 --> 00:46:54,300
Rym: Sam a flange.

727
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,338
Rym: They invented a new one.

728
00:46:55,801 --> 00:46:56,617
Scott: Sam a flange.

729
00:46:57,222 --> 00:46:57,878
Rym: Sam a flange.

730
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:58,401
Scott: All right.

731
00:46:58,461 --> 00:47:04,597
Rym: So so we were going to do this show on, you know, this whole show was supposed to be about, you know, hiring and I.T.

732
00:47:04,637 --> 00:47:04,798
Rym: and CS.

733
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:11,039
Rym: Like, how do you not from the perspective of how do I get in a job in technology, even though that's what someone emailed us and asked us?

734
00:47:11,342 --> 00:47:13,580
Rym: Yes, but we've done a bunch of shows about that, I'm pretty sure.

735
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:19,985
Rym: But the idea was on the other side, how do you pick out a good candidate for a technological technological job?

736
00:47:20,005 --> 00:47:30,919
Scott: Because right now, you know, with the bad economies and whatnot, there are plenty of out of work tech peoples from various companies and they're looking for work, but most of them are no good.

737
00:47:31,482 --> 00:47:35,040
Scott: So if you're at a company and you're hired, you know, you're looking for a tech person.

738
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:38,982
Scott: because even when the economy is bad, good tech people are hard to find and everyone needs them.

739
00:47:39,865 --> 00:47:43,740
Scott: How do you know if a tech person is good or crappy?

740
00:47:44,586 --> 00:47:45,360
Scott: It's very difficult.

741
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:46,483
Scott: Yes, very difficult.

742
00:47:46,604 --> 00:47:54,660
Rym: And because we've been hiring people off and on and I've actually had the opportunity to be party to many interviews with potential candidates here.

743
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:58,080
Rym: And I sat in on one or two interviews at IBM and at the hospital.

744
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:07,539
Rym: And it's often very difficult to interview technological people, because on one hand, you want to vet their skills.

745
00:48:07,721 --> 00:48:14,496
Rym: But on the other hand, I don't know, I've always felt awkward asking people very technical questions like, what's the command to do this?

746
00:48:15,099 --> 00:48:15,140
Rym: or.

747
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:15,703
Rym: All right.

748
00:48:15,764 --> 00:48:16,619
Rym: So you said, you know, this.

749
00:48:17,343 --> 00:48:19,219
Rym: What are the four parts of the samoflage?

750
00:48:19,841 --> 00:48:30,700
Scott: Yeah, it's like you like you either end up asking sort of like stupid like test questions for like shit in school, like, you know, what are the five aspects of blood?

751
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:33,300
Scott: It's like unless someone's just out of college, they don't know.

752
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:38,684
Scott: And whether they get the right answer or not doesn't show whether they actually know what they're doing or not.

753
00:48:38,724 --> 00:48:46,159
Scott: And sort of, you know, to give someone a real test, you'd have to like put them in front of a computer and sort of watch them try to solve a problem of.

754
00:48:46,259 --> 00:48:49,200
Scott: that is, you know, like the problem you want them to solve.

755
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:58,800
Rym: If you were to hire them, you really like when I ask questions like that, you always feel like you're kind of like you're implying straight up that you do not trust that the person is being forthright with their credentials.

756
00:48:59,040 --> 00:48:59,120
Scott: Yeah.

757
00:48:59,141 --> 00:49:04,169
Scott: It's like if the person was actually a good tech person, you ask that kind of question, they'd be stooped.

758
00:49:04,209 --> 00:49:05,600
Scott: They'd be very annoyed.

759
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:09,703
Scott: Like Google asked me those kind of questions and they were like, don't look it up on Google.

760
00:49:09,743 --> 00:49:11,297
Scott: So being honest, I didn't.

761
00:49:11,861 --> 00:49:18,620
Scott: And they were the kind of questions you see on like a test in college, the kind of thing that nobody knows except for someone who just went to college.

762
00:49:19,002 --> 00:49:26,320
Scott: And it just really it actually made me not want to work there because the questions were so insultingly annoying, stupid questions.

763
00:49:26,941 --> 00:49:37,101
Rym: But what I've realized and what Scott's realized as time has gone on, that really the best way to interview tech people comes down to the simple truism of it takes one to know one.

764
00:49:37,744 --> 00:49:56,061
Rym: And it seems like I found that if you're talking to someone and the best way to interview is just to try to talk to them as though you would talk to any of your technological friends, like just engage them the way you would engage anyone else you work with or anyone else, you know, who is technical and see if they reciprocate in kind or not.

765
00:49:56,122 --> 00:50:00,339
Rym: I mean, and it's telling right away whether or not they know.

766
00:50:00,621 --> 00:50:00,822
Rym: Yeah.

767
00:50:00,862 --> 00:50:04,822
Scott: Like I could go up to someone and be like, yeah, have you have you ever heard of Django?

768
00:50:04,882 --> 00:50:08,940
Scott: I'd be like, oh, man, it's got this, you know, great database object model.

769
00:50:09,221 --> 00:50:10,324
Scott: It's pretty awesome.

770
00:50:10,785 --> 00:50:18,260
Scott: And if he was just like, yep, that he's not demonstrating to me that he knows what I'm talking about.

771
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:26,620
Scott: But if I, you know, say things like that and they go, oh, yeah, you know, and it's all I've heard, you know, it's a lot like this other thing that has a whatever.

772
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:30,940
Scott: And they use also the complicated words that laymen wouldn't know.

773
00:50:31,021 --> 00:50:32,100
Scott: And they use them correctly.

774
00:50:32,502 --> 00:50:35,080
Scott: You know, they're demonstrating to you that they know what they're talking about.

775
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:39,220
Scott: Like I could go let's say I went to go interview for a job as like a carpenter.

776
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:39,541
Scott: Right.

777
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:42,920
Scott: And, you know, the carpenter, like, have you carpeted before?

778
00:50:43,362 --> 00:50:45,232
Scott: Yes.

779
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:46,600
Scott: What carpeting have you done?

780
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:51,120
Scott: I built houses, you know, what houses did you build?

781
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:52,267
Rym: Big one.

782
00:50:52,469 --> 00:50:53,420
Rym: Or consider the difference.

783
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:54,089
Rym: How many?

784
00:50:54,129 --> 00:50:54,640
Rym: A hundred.

785
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,880
Rym: Consider the difference between these two questions.

786
00:50:57,361 --> 00:50:59,140
Rym: Do you know your way around a samoflange?

787
00:50:59,901 --> 00:51:02,068
Rym: Yes.

788
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:05,240
Rym: So do you prefer a samoflange or a blamoflange?

789
00:51:07,046 --> 00:51:07,591
Scott: And why?

790
00:51:07,611 --> 00:51:07,692
Scott: Yeah.

791
00:51:08,682 --> 00:51:10,540
Rym: Or, you know, we use samoflanges here.

792
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:12,760
Scott: I like samoflanges because the name sounds better.

793
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:13,840
Scott: It rolls out the tongue.

794
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:15,424
Rym: But there's like.

795
00:51:15,464 --> 00:51:26,599
Rym: I think like the most telling thing I ran into was that, you know, if I ask people questions that basically amount to how would you find something in a bunch of log files, you know, like a really simple question is one of those.

796
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:29,253
Rym: Do you actually know your way around the Linux command line?

797
00:51:29,334 --> 00:51:35,080
Rym: or are you just saying you do because you installed Ubuntu once and it's what verbs do they use?

798
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:48,720
Rym: I mean, to many people I talk to who don't really know and, you know, further questioning proves that they don't really know will say, well, I would search through the logs and people who know would say, well, I'd grep for the unique idea in the logs.

799
00:51:49,101 --> 00:51:55,748
Rym: And the fact that they use the verb grep instead of the verb search tells me more than any other.

800
00:51:55,808 --> 00:51:57,360
Rym: like anything else I would have asked them.

801
00:51:57,662 --> 00:52:00,080
Rym: That simple difference tells me right away if they're worth talking to.

802
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:00,480
Rym: Yeah.

803
00:52:00,501 --> 00:52:08,620
Scott: You basically have to ask them questions which require them to say the complicated, you know, insider words.

804
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:09,081
Scott: Right.

805
00:52:09,141 --> 00:52:17,575
Scott: Like, you know, if you ask them, do you know C++, they'll be like, yes, I have 100 years experience in C++.

806
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,212
Scott: I'm a C++ master.

807
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:20,201
Scott: Right.

808
00:52:20,823 --> 00:52:28,744
Scott: But if you're like, you know, in C++, you know, what kind of you know, what's your favorite X?

809
00:52:29,327 --> 00:52:32,080
Scott: And they have to actually know what an X is.

810
00:52:32,602 --> 00:52:37,440
Scott: And then, you know, name one and, you know, explain why it's their favorite.

811
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:46,254
Scott: Like, oh, I like the, you know, the the one in the STL because, you know, this reason or what, you know, they have to actually give a real answer.

812
00:52:46,314 --> 00:53:04,033
Scott: that requires them to say like if you're in the carpeting, the same thing, you know, may ask someone a question where they actually are required to say something about like some sort of wooden structure, you know, as opposed to just saying, yes, I can build stairs, be like, you know, do you like to build stairs in, you know, which?

813
00:53:04,113 --> 00:53:06,385
Scott: which style stairs do you like to build the most?

814
00:53:06,807 --> 00:53:08,317
Scott: You know, it's like I need to know now.

815
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:11,440
Scott: I need to know different stair styles.

816
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:14,620
Scott: If I can't name a stair style, I'm fucked up like like.

817
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:17,058
Rym: So do you like to build staircases or stairwells?

818
00:53:18,964 --> 00:53:20,019
Scott: Someone doesn't know the difference.

819
00:53:21,126 --> 00:53:22,059
Scott: It's like a big trouble.

820
00:53:22,762 --> 00:53:27,640
Rym: And like two questions in particular is like instead of saying, can you do you know your way around the Linux command line?

821
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:29,580
Rym: Can you work without a graphical environment?

822
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:30,102
Rym: Just ask.

823
00:53:30,483 --> 00:53:34,000
Rym: So what text editor do you use or what shell do you prefer?

824
00:53:34,181 --> 00:53:37,060
Rym: Because they might say, yeah, I know my way around Linux.

825
00:53:37,201 --> 00:53:42,323
Rym: But if you ask them what shell they prefer, they've got to know the name of at least one shell.

826
00:53:42,343 --> 00:53:44,560
Scott: They got to know what a shell is and they got to be able to name it.

827
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:47,800
Scott: You know, even if you ask a question like, do you like V.I.

828
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:48,483
Scott: or Emacs?

829
00:53:48,543 --> 00:53:58,140
Scott: Well, they could just basically say, oh, I like Emacs or oh, I like V.I If you say what text editor to use, they need to know what a text editor is and they need to be able to name a text editor.

830
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:03,360
Rym: And yeah, and it's also very telling because if they say notepad, then I know better.

831
00:54:03,482 --> 00:54:04,678
Rym: I know that they do not know.

832
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:05,382
Scott: Yes.

833
00:54:05,582 --> 00:54:10,961
Rym: And if they say Pico, while Pico is silly, at least they know what a text editor is.

834
00:54:10,981 --> 00:54:11,042
Rym: Yep.

835
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:13,707
Scott: Yeah.

836
00:54:13,988 --> 00:54:16,320
Rym: Sadly, that's pretty much it.

837
00:54:17,061 --> 00:54:17,362
Scott: I think.

838
00:54:17,804 --> 00:54:21,080
Scott: Well, I think the real problem is that if you want to hire a tech person.

839
00:54:21,241 --> 00:54:21,481
Scott: Right.

840
00:54:22,244 --> 00:54:26,560
Scott: But you don't already have a good tech person at your disposal.

841
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:27,532
Rym: Well, then you're screwed.

842
00:54:27,817 --> 00:54:28,060
Scott: Yeah.

843
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:33,105
Rym: Well, I guess the only option there is to not go for the technical knowledge route, but to go for the.

844
00:54:33,587 --> 00:54:35,660
Rym: is this person very smart route?

845
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:40,060
Rym: And it's not hard to figure out if someone is smart by interviewing them.

846
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:42,419
Rym: Just ask them difficult questions and see how they answer.

847
00:54:42,861 --> 00:54:43,082
Rym: Yeah.

848
00:54:43,683 --> 00:54:59,000
Scott: I think another good thing is if you you might not have like a tech person on staff, but, you know, there are plenty of tech people around who maybe you could like get them to help you out and, you know, be like, hey, is this person smart?

849
00:54:59,161 --> 00:55:03,320
Scott: You know, here is like their resume, you know, or hey, is this person smart?

850
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,059
Scott: I recorded the interview with them.

851
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:05,965
Scott: Listen to this tape.

852
00:55:06,246 --> 00:55:08,600
Scott: They said some complicated words there.

853
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:14,879
Scott: They bullshitting, you know, like an RIT when I said plenty of tech people on the Internet who will talk to you.

854
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:23,783
Rym: I sat in on interviews with like other people to work for the IT department and pretty much like they would always have people sit in and the hospital did the same thing, just technical people.

855
00:55:23,924 --> 00:55:28,910
Rym: Or even when I interviewed at Nature magazine a long time ago, they had a tech guy just sit there.

856
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:29,940
Rym: He didn't ask any questions.

857
00:55:30,363 --> 00:55:32,339
Rym: He just sat in the room while I talked to the big guy.

858
00:55:32,981 --> 00:55:39,347
Rym: And the only purpose of these people is to after the person leaves, say, yeah, he knows what he's talking about.

859
00:55:39,367 --> 00:55:41,580
Rym: or now he was just using buzzwords.

860
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:42,561
Scott: Yep.

861
00:55:43,003 --> 00:55:46,600
Rym: And I guess it's really, really obvious to tech people.

862
00:55:46,722 --> 00:55:47,640
Rym: And it's not obvious.

863
00:55:47,942 --> 00:55:49,100
Rym: Well, I mean, it's obvious.

864
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:53,444
Scott: It's really, you know, we say tech because that's what we are, but it's the same in any profession.

865
00:55:53,625 --> 00:56:03,539
Scott: I mean, if a graphic designer was interviewing, you know, some other graphic designer, they could tell right away if the person was saying like, you know, like, oh, man, what Photoshop filter do you use?

866
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:12,120
Rym: You know, it's like instead of tech, I guess experts, anyone who's an expert in their field can tell experts in their field from people who don't know their field at all.

867
00:56:12,541 --> 00:56:12,741
Scott: Yeah.

868
00:56:12,781 --> 00:56:14,427
Scott: Now, they can have a real problem.

869
00:56:14,447 --> 00:56:21,140
Scott: if you have someone on your side who is actually a dumb ass, then a smart person comes along.

870
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:23,719
Scott: The dumb ass will think the smart person is a dumb ass.

871
00:56:24,241 --> 00:56:29,198
Scott: And then you're sort of in a trap, which is, I think, another compounding reason why I.T.

872
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:34,500
Scott: and, you know, basically tech departments tend to either be all smart or all stupid.

873
00:56:34,981 --> 00:56:41,759
Rym: Yeah, I very rarely run into a case because if it's all stupid, if a smart person gets hired by accident, they get the hell out.

874
00:56:41,941 --> 00:56:44,480
Scott: That's right, because they get pissed off that everything is so stupid.

875
00:56:44,824 --> 00:56:46,079
Scott: They get frustrated and they leave.

876
00:56:46,401 --> 00:56:49,460
Rym: And if it's all smart people, well, the stupid person can't possibly get hired.

877
00:56:49,661 --> 00:56:50,083
Rym: That's right.

878
00:56:50,305 --> 00:56:52,679
Rym: So there's really no way to have a mixed bag I.T.

879
00:56:53,282 --> 00:57:01,676
Rym: unless you have the giant bureaucracy that acts in such a capricious and random way that it hires a 50/50 balance.

880
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:03,664
Scott: Well, what you can have.

881
00:57:03,704 --> 00:57:09,399
Scott: what can happen a lot of times is a company that has met is big enough as many tech departments.

882
00:57:09,922 --> 00:57:13,720
Scott: So you'll get like this R&D department with all these smart people.

883
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:21,140
Scott: But then like the people who do all like, you know, the switching for the company network or complete retards, you know, stuff like that can happen.

884
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:25,840
Scott: But it's or maybe you get like a bunch of like the higher ups in the department.

885
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,079
Scott: You know, the department is so big.

886
00:57:27,401 --> 00:57:33,640
Scott: Maybe the CTO and the developers are real smart, but the guys and help desk people are dumb, you know, stuff like that can happen.

887
00:57:34,241 --> 00:57:44,600
Scott: But so honestly, the people actually work together in tech, you know, directly co-workers, you know, who see each other every day and sit next to each other or either all smart or all stupid, most likely.

888
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:55,199
Rym: The one thing I do want to bring up really quickly before I end this travesty and go to bed is that personality does count for a lot and don't sure does never pick the person who's perfect in every way.

889
00:57:55,802 --> 00:57:58,440
Rym: If when you ask them what they do outside of work, don't have an answer.

890
00:57:58,700 --> 00:57:58,801
Scott: Right.

891
00:57:58,841 --> 00:58:02,100
Scott: Some guy comes in, you'd be like, you know, what's your favorite idea?

892
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:06,384
Scott: And he's like, oh, I like to use a clips, but real like text that, you know, he knows what he's talking about.

893
00:58:06,746 --> 00:58:09,440
Scott: But then you'd be like, you know, what do you do after work?

894
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:12,180
Scott: He's like, oh, go home, watch TV, go to bed.

895
00:58:13,041 --> 00:58:20,600
Scott: Don't hire that guy, because I mean, even if he's smart and maybe a work card, you know, is a really boring verse.

896
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:25,223
Rym: Well, there are two kinds of people who do not really answer when you ask them what they do outside of work.

897
00:58:25,805 --> 00:58:33,660
Rym: One kind is the person who is doing something that they don't want their employer to know about, which is fine, because usually that's something really awesome.

898
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:34,060
Scott: Yeah.

899
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:43,340
Scott: It's like the guy's not going to tell you in a job interview that he runs the BDSM dungeon, even though if he does, you should probably hire him because he's totally cool.

900
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:43,701
Rym: Yeah.

901
00:58:43,722 --> 00:58:45,339
Rym: If I was interviewing someone for an I.T.

902
00:58:45,481 --> 00:58:46,960
Rym: job and I was like, so what do you do outside of work?

903
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,840
Rym: And he was like, I run the BDSM dungeon down in Newport.

904
00:58:51,181 --> 00:58:54,520
Scott: I'd be like, you're hired as long as you knew the tech he was talking about.

905
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:54,803
Scott: Yeah.

906
00:58:54,985 --> 00:58:56,380
Rym: But I'm like, oh, so that's your hobby.

907
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:57,004
Rym: Anything else?

908
00:58:57,024 --> 00:58:59,000
Rym: And like, yeah, I ski to, you know, people like that.

909
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:04,940
Rym: But most people I found who don't have an answer actually don't have an answer.

910
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:10,365
Rym: Like I remember back at the hospital, I was helping interview someone and they were pretty technically qualified.

911
00:59:10,405 --> 00:59:15,160
Rym: But when I asked the guy what he did outside of work and he didn't really have an answer, like he didn't really do anything.

912
00:59:15,261 --> 00:59:18,999
Rym: And the thing he said was, well, I don't really have any hobbies or anything.

913
00:59:20,081 --> 00:59:22,189
Rym: And to which I that always just said.

914
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:26,300
Scott: that not only tells me that he's a boring person that you don't want to go on that.

915
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:26,601
Rym: I think.

916
00:59:26,903 --> 00:59:28,371
Rym: So why are you getting a job like?

917
00:59:28,934 --> 00:59:30,040
Rym: is work going to be your life?

918
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:30,962
Rym: What's your life?

919
00:59:31,444 --> 00:59:36,482
Rym: You work because you have bills to pay to live your real life or have a job.

920
00:59:36,522 --> 00:59:37,026
Rym: That's awesome.

921
00:59:37,066 --> 00:59:39,139
Rym: And the job he was applying for was not awesome.

922
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:46,860
Rym: Therefore, and he didn't give off the vibe of like, I'm a Russian hacker who's escaping the law and I'm hiding my Russian hacking hobby.

923
00:59:47,581 --> 01:00:00,420
Scott: I mean, if somebody doesn't have a, you know, a thing outside of work that they're working for, then either a their work is it, which means they better be, you know, they better be like the company owner or something where the work is their thing.

924
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:02,560
Rym: Or it's just that they're passionate about what they're doing.

925
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:03,264
Scott: Right.

926
01:00:03,304 --> 01:00:05,078
Rym: No one's passionate about low level I.T.

927
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:05,521
Rym: Right.

928
01:00:06,263 --> 01:00:12,243
Scott: Or or, you know, the question becomes, even if this person can do this job, what's their?

929
01:00:12,385 --> 01:00:13,520
Scott: do they have any motivation?

930
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:13,921
Scott: Will they?

931
01:00:13,961 --> 01:00:19,899
Scott: will they care that, you know, I mean, like I work because I can have money to do things outside of work.

932
01:00:20,081 --> 01:00:22,660
Scott: If I didn't do anything outside of work, then why would I work?

933
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:25,760
Scott: I would just be a lazy as bum at work, not caring so much.

934
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:32,378
Scott: You know, if you have something else you care about and work supports that thing, then that caring transfers over to the work.

935
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:52,334
Rym: Plus, speaking from experience, the place I work now just is is so much more amazing in terms of just the level of intelligence at all levels compared to everywhere else I've worked and everything else I've ever done in, I guess, in official non GeekNights, you know, working in the real world capacity, which also includes most of my classes, you know, back in school.

936
01:00:52,394 --> 01:00:59,670
Rym: But the one thing that really stands out is that every single person in the place I work, all the technical people, all the like H.R.

937
01:00:59,770 --> 01:01:06,729
Rym: people, everyone, they have like big things they're doing outside of work, like things on the same level of GeekNights for me.

938
01:01:06,890 --> 01:01:16,150
Rym: Like everyone, like they're doing their doctoral theses or they travel the world all the time or they're like a professional chef for fun on the side.

939
01:01:16,450 --> 01:01:22,834
Rym: Like everyone has this full time hobby or this like really big family or something crazy outside of work.

940
01:01:22,874 --> 01:01:27,973
Rym: And work is great and they love their work, but work is just one part of their lives.

941
01:01:28,595 --> 01:01:34,189
Rym: And I noticed that most of the other places I've worked, work seemed to be the only thing these people had.

942
01:01:34,511 --> 01:01:42,580
Rym: Yeah, people would stay late on purpose to not go home to the Y as opposed to staying late because they really want to finish that awesome piece of code they're working on for the algorithm.

943
01:01:42,863 --> 01:01:43,530
Rym: Baphma dad.

944
01:01:43,911 --> 01:01:44,113
Scott: Yep.

945
01:01:44,999 --> 01:01:46,630
Rym: And on that note, I kind of want to go to bed.

946
01:01:46,690 --> 01:01:47,849
Rym: I think we'll just stop it right there.

947
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:48,151
Scott: Yeah.

948
01:01:48,473 --> 01:01:52,881
Scott: And if you're I guess, you know, for the people who are interviewing for jobs, just do in reverse.

949
01:01:53,226 --> 01:01:53,409
Rym: Yes.

950
01:01:54,750 --> 01:02:02,310
Rym: And if you have an awesome hobby, even if you think your employer might think it's bad, just let it out there because you don't hide anything.

951
01:02:02,391 --> 01:02:05,230
Scott: Just answer every question completely openly and honestly.

952
01:02:05,410 --> 01:02:08,150
Scott: And if they don't like your answer, you don't want to work there.

953
01:02:08,310 --> 01:02:10,210
Rym: I used to hide GeekNights from employers.

954
01:02:10,372 --> 01:02:11,790
Scott: I never hit anything I do.

955
01:02:12,271 --> 01:02:23,486
Rym: And the fact that I now GeekNights like is I don't not like my resume, but GeekNights and like the anime convention stuff I do and even the anime club, they're all on my resume straight up.

956
01:02:24,031 --> 01:02:24,212
Scott: Yep.

957
01:02:24,674 --> 01:02:35,204
Scott: I mean, if you made some cool YouTube's slap that on there, you know, I mean, as well, I mean, it might, you know, don't slap on say on the video shotgunning nine beers while being tased.

958
01:02:35,406 --> 01:02:35,670
Scott: Right.

959
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:42,693
Rym: But do unless you're going into a job that requires you to be able to act under pressure while being tased.

960
01:02:44,017 --> 01:03:07,262
Scott: But if you made like a silly, you know, animation right of, you know, like, say, a video game character, say, mashed up with some anime you like, you know, it's like a little five second happy, cute, you know, even if it's a as long as it's a disgusting, you know, fortune kind of thing, be like, yeah, I make animations, you know, and that sounds really impressive, you know, even though they might in reality, it's fortune animations.

961
01:03:07,364 --> 01:03:07,790
Scott: They will never.

962
01:03:08,070 --> 01:03:08,779
Rym: I'll put it this way.

963
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:09,548
Scott: They will never check.

964
01:03:10,051 --> 01:03:11,350
Rym: Pack packs is really fun.

965
01:03:11,390 --> 01:03:18,288
Rym: And I'm really proud to have presented a discussion at the Penny Arcade Expo because not that many people get to do that.

966
01:03:19,410 --> 01:03:30,192
Rym: But it sounds like putting on a resume or explaining it to someone who doesn't really know what conventions are like, it sounds so much more impressive than it is and things like.

967
01:03:30,252 --> 01:03:37,089
Scott: things like what in reality we stood up in front of a room with one hundred, you know, peers in it and we said, hey, what's up, guys?

968
01:03:37,713 --> 01:03:38,283
Scott: Check this out.

969
01:03:38,323 --> 01:03:38,710
Scott: Burning wheel.

970
01:03:39,455 --> 01:03:40,569
Scott: All right, let's go have fun.

971
01:03:40,810 --> 01:03:40,911
Rym: Bye.

972
01:03:41,172 --> 01:03:41,393
Rym: Yeah.

973
01:03:41,433 --> 01:03:45,989
Rym: But just all the hobbies and things on this, I guess we're turning this back into the how to get hired.

974
01:03:46,411 --> 01:03:59,490
Rym: All the things you do on the side always sound or actually are a lot more impressive to other people who haven't done them, because the more you do awesome things, the more you'll start to trivialize them in your own mind because they become easy for you.

975
01:03:59,610 --> 01:04:07,070
Rym: I mean, if you're a juggler and you become an awesome juggler, things that are amazing to people who can't juggle, you don't even think about because you do them all the time.

976
01:04:07,170 --> 01:04:11,917
Rym: So you'll start to forget how impressive they are to people who aren't kind of into that thing.

977
01:04:12,826 --> 01:04:13,170
Rym: That's it.

978
01:04:13,410 --> 01:04:13,820
Rym: Going to bed.

979
01:04:14,066 --> 01:04:14,210
Scott: Yeah.

980
01:04:20,912 --> 01:04:23,010
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

981
01:04:23,230 --> 01:04:25,610
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music.

982

983
01:04:38,170 --> 01:04:43,769
Rym: We say feeds plural because GeekNights airs four nights a week covering four different brands of geekery.

984
01:04:44,350 --> 01:04:45,869
Rym: Mondays are science and technology.

985
01:04:46,030 --> 01:04:48,470
Rym: Tuesdays we have video games, board games and RPGs.

986
01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:54,389
Rym: Wednesdays are anime, manga, comic nights and Thursdays are the catch alls for various rants and tomfoolery.

987
01:04:54,871 --> 01:05:02,929
Scott: You can send us feedback by email to geeknights@frontroadcrew.com or you can send audio feedback via Odeo.

988
01:05:03,350 --> 01:05:06,470
Scott: Just click the link that says send me an Odeo on the right side of our website.

989
01:05:06,950 --> 01:05:11,990
Rym: If you like what you hear, you can catch the last 100 episodes in iTunes or in your favorite podcatcher.

994

Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
