00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,620
Scott: So today, for the first time in quite a long time, we have an interview on GeekNights.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:05,400
Scott: Isn't that amazing?

3
00:00:05,802 --> 00:00:06,960
Rym: I can't believe this day has come.

4
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:08,340
Scott: I can't believe this day has come either.

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,339
Scott: So for the first interview GeekNights has done in, I don't know, maybe six months, maybe even over a year.

6
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:15,700
Rym: Since Jeff to Tarek.

7
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:16,759
Scott: Since Jeff to Tarek.

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,278
Scott: We have with us someone you may or may not know, Tarn Adams.

9
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,379
Guest: Hey, I'm Tarn Adams.

10
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:25,820
Scott: Alright.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,380
Scott: That's right.

12
00:00:26,601 --> 00:00:33,520
Scott: Most of you probably have no idea who Tarn Adams is, but he is the, are you the only developer of Dwarf Fortress?

13
00:00:34,381 --> 00:00:37,560
Guest: I'm the only programmer, but I actually designed it with my brother.

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,479
Guest: We've just kind of been working on games our whole lives or whatever, so it's sort of organic at this point.

15
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:59,200
Guest: It's like we share the same brain or something, but he doesn't like programming so much anymore, so I kind of do the grunt work, but then we just talk about it at night or whatever, like what's going on with the game and where we want to take it and where things are going and all that kind of stuff.

16
00:00:59,741 --> 00:01:06,060
Guest: But yeah, so I mean I'll actually, I'll probably be saying we or I at random throughout the entire interview.

17
00:01:06,661 --> 00:01:17,558
Guest: It's like we want to do this and I did this and that kind of thing, so if I sound really confusing or I sound like I'm some kind of British monarch or something, then that's the reason.

18
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:24,760
Scott: Alright, so for our listeners who may not be familiar with Dwarf Fortress, can you give a brief synopsis of what it is exactly?

19
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:36,180
Guest: Well I mean, so the game right now is, according to the version number, it's about 27% done, so there's what the game is and what we want it to be.

20
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:56,723
Guest: So ideally the Dwarf Fortress is a fantasy world simulator, so the game would create a world, run its history up through some point, and then you can kind of jump in, assume whatever role you like, and just kind of be a part of that and actually have an effect on a persistent universe.

21
00:01:56,763 --> 00:02:10,380
Guest: and then you can come back, see what's happened, see how things have changed and you know, interact with it some more without having a fixed plot or anything that's scripted and we just kind of wanted to see how far we could take that.

22
00:02:12,004 --> 00:02:56,616
Guest: So we're not there at this point and you hear things like that all the time, you know, this is going to be, the next big game is going to react to what the user does and so on and so, and I don't want to over-hype it, we're not there right now, but what we've got now, we do have this world that's generated but the kind of roles that you can assume right now are pretty limited and it's called Dwarf Fortress right now because the principle thing you can do with the game is once you've got this world sitting there with various little human empires and elves and kind of standard stuff, then you can start an outpost in the mountains and it's pretty free form, you can start anywhere you like.

23
00:02:56,676 --> 00:03:47,835
Guest: but let's say you start at a cliff face and you have seven dwarves right now and you have a wagon of supplies and you can dig into the mountain mine, you get rocks left behind that you can make crafts out of and so on and you can cut down trees, make little structures and do things, I mean, I'm not quite sure what to liken it to, I mean parts of it play like an RTS and parts of it play like Dig Dug, I don't really know but you can just build yourself up and then immigrants will come and make your fortress larger and you have the kind of standard fantasy things to deal with like dragons and armies of monsters and stuff like that.

24
00:03:47,856 --> 00:04:08,592
Guest: as you grow your outpost and there's quite a bit to do there, we tried to kind of put in details where we could, like scrapping hit points for example and replacing it with actual body parts and things that happen to them having specific effects and so on.

25
00:04:09,134 --> 00:04:30,546
Guest: and then the kind of overarching thing that leads back to where we want the game to go is that once the fortress, you always lose the game as long as you keep playing, it's eventually going to fall apart somehow and then your fortress is left behind in this world that you've generated and you have a few options.

26
00:04:30,586 --> 00:05:18,554
Guest: then, right now you can reclaim the fortress, that means send some more dwarves there, there could be some critters living there depending on the version of the game you're playing and then you can kind of start your settlement again and get it going again, alternatively there's another mode of the game called adventure mode where you have more of a, it's sort of unformed right now but you have the beginnings of an adventure character that say starts in one of the human towns and then you can wander around the world doing very few things right now aside from just killing things or being quest to kill a few monsters but you can also visit your old fortress and this is kind of where we're achieving some of the goals we had set for ourselves.

27
00:05:18,654 --> 00:05:39,569
Guest: so you can bring your adventure back to your old fortress, you can see all of the items that your dwarves have made, the things that your dwarves have built, if there's engravings on the wall that your dwarves have made it'll give you some very specific details about what historical events they've depicted, stuff like that.

28
00:05:40,552 --> 00:06:04,185
Guest: that kind of leads to this universe becoming more alive over several plays and you can also do things like if your adventurer gets killed by some monster and then you go meet it again with another monster, the monster will kind of bring up the old adventurer and how he died and how he screamed like a little baby or whatever.

29
00:06:05,348 --> 00:06:24,589
Guest: and it just kind of, it's sort of the things that harkens back to these really old kind of first roguelike games where it would sort of, these text games where it would save that your character had died and then you could find their body afterward and their items and their ghost or whatever.

30
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:57,731
Guest: and so we've kind of taken that sort of idea, this sort of persistence to an extreme now because we've always, we, see I'm doing it, we've always liked these games, I don't think my brother will mind if I speak for him occasionally but we've always liked these games where their persistent effects, even if it's just losing, I guess it's because we just played in the arcade so much, I mean I wouldn't really trace it back to the roguelike games so much as just playing gauntlet and losing or something and where there's sort of a permanent effect.

31
00:06:57,772 --> 00:07:01,106
Guest: but then there's a record of what you've done which would be something like a high score list.

32
00:07:02,771 --> 00:07:22,363
Guest: and so we've always liked having a game where you have sort of a permanent effect, it carries on but what you're doing isn't just based on save, load, save, load, save, load, go back to the checkpoint, that kind of thing where you're just sort of grinding through someone's story, instead you're sort of making your own.

33
00:07:24,067 --> 00:07:29,360
Guest: but yeah I guess that's the blurb, is that right?

34
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:44,299
Rym: I find it interesting, I think this is what I find most fascinating about Dwarf Fortress, you talk about how playing the game you will eventually lose, you will always lose, I remember on the website it is mentioned frequently that "losing is fun" and this is repeated like a mantra.

35
00:07:46,461 --> 00:07:50,791
Guest: It would be depressing if you don't, if you're like "if it's not fun".

36
00:07:50,812 --> 00:08:20,089
Guest: I mean well there's what I want to say, the other thing is I've tried to, in this kind of PR thing trying to make people feel comfortable with the concept, the other thing is I say that you're playing, you're not playing your fortress or you're not playing your adventure, you're really playing the world, you create a world and now if the world's destroyed or the save gets corrupted or something that is tragic and sad.

37
00:08:20,270 --> 00:09:03,631
Guest: but if you just lose an adventure or something every single time you lose the game your world becomes enriched, this world that you're playing, it just becomes, I mean I could create or someone writing a plot for a game could create a story but you can only become so invested in that, I mean it's, I've never actually cared for stories in games so much, I mean I always found it more moving to read a book or something rather than the story in a video game because often times in a video game something might be building up but then you have to play it six more times until you kill the thing correctly and then you get to see the next part or something.

38
00:09:03,692 --> 00:09:19,402
Guest: so this way we've kind of removed any of that sort of blockage to making the stories proceed and so you can kind of, and you'll be much more invested in things that you've actually experienced yourself.

39
00:09:19,543 --> 00:09:42,062
Guest: and then if some kind of Ettin comes back and it starts arguing with itself about how tasty your last adventurer was that could, that'll mean something to you because you'll actually, you know who he's talking about and you'll have actually played that character previously rather than just having it be some sort of NPC that you're supposed to care about or something.

40
00:09:42,926 --> 00:09:44,916
Guest: But yeah, yeah.

41
00:09:46,623 --> 00:09:50,020
Scott: Okay, so how and when did this crazy thing get started?

42
00:09:51,481 --> 00:09:57,180
Guest: Okay, so yeah I started that like, yes okay now it's time for me to read my narrative.

43
00:09:57,461 --> 00:10:15,432
Guest: No it's, well it's sort of tricky because there was this other game that I kind of removed the links for, you can still find it but you might notice that Dwarf Fortress is actually called Slaves to Armok, God of Blood Chapter 2 Dwarf Fortress.

44
00:10:16,014 --> 00:10:17,499
Guest: and so what is this?

45
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:18,543
Guest: Slaves to Armok?

46
00:10:19,145 --> 00:10:20,289
Guest: Well that was our fantasy game.

47
00:10:20,309 --> 00:10:49,684
Guest: so we've always had this notion, meaning my brother and I, and actually in high school, another of our friends, where we'd, that was Alan, we'd talk about this fantasy game that we wanted to write and it kind of stems from the sort of disappointments that we'd had as gaming sort of entered the early and mid nineties where it wasn't, it didn't seem like it was moving forward quite so fast as it had been before.

48
00:10:49,704 --> 00:10:58,103
Guest: There would always be these new games coming out that tried these wildly new things and then it just kind of was sorting, just not moving forward fast enough or something conceptually.

49
00:10:58,163 --> 00:11:10,287
Guest: so we were like okay, you know, I think it comes out of playing some of these role playing games like, I don't know, what was it, Cyberpunk or something where the, was the first one we played, I know there was a bunch of them but the first one we played that didn't just have straight hit points or something.

50
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:15,447
Guest: and so we were like, you know, why don't computer games do this?

51
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:24,642
Guest: They can take advantage of that a lot better than actually pen and paper stuff can as far as grinding through calculations to see if you can walk anymore and stuff like that.

52
00:11:26,547 --> 00:11:42,491
Guest: So we had these, a bunch of ideas about what a fantasy game could look like and we were getting kind of tired of, you know, buying a game and then, you know, in three hours you've won it, it happened with the King's Quest type games just from the beginning, it's always just sort of been disappointing.

53
00:11:43,154 --> 00:12:17,509
Guest: So we had this idea and this is where the original game, because we were limited to eight letters back then it was called Drag Slay for Dragon Slayer and it's kind of like the adventure mode version of Dwarf Fortress except parts were more fleshed out and parts were less fleshed out, it was just more adventure centered and so we had to kind of introduce our damage system, not quite the same but basically the same as it is in Dwarf Fortress and, you know, some other persistent effects and so on.

54
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:28,374
Guest: I never released this, it was just when I was learning how to do C, it was one of the first games I made when I was in high school and that continued up until I was about a sophomore in college I guess.

55
00:12:28,775 --> 00:12:40,577
Guest: and then we were like alright, the Drag Slay code is kind of dead because we were on some kind of Borland compiler where it would let you have more than 65k of something or other and so I just had to ditch it.

56
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:53,582
Guest: And then I started learning more graphics stuff, you couldn't tell from looking at Dwarf Fortress but I was actually making some 2D, 3D type stuff, nothing impressive but just learning the ropes or whatever.

57
00:12:54,505 --> 00:12:58,136
Guest: and then we had various games trying to get started.

58
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:07,481
Guest: I've got a graveyard of just bizarre dead projects, hundreds of them and occasionally something will stick right?

59
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:11,648
Guest: But I guess it was maybe 1999, 2000 or something.

60
00:13:11,748 --> 00:13:21,325
Guest: I started Slaves to Armok, God of Blood, the second version of that.

61
00:13:21,365 --> 00:13:57,477
Guest: The first one was this one where it's sort of I wouldn't call it isometric but just kind of looking sort of down like that, these little animated characters in VGA running around killing each other in this 10 by 10 maze where they just kind of drop down and they walk around, we had about 200 animation frames for them, they weren't 3D though, they were just a bunch of rotated bitmaps and they'd walk around wearing loin cloths to goblins and humans and they'd run around trying to find the sword so that they could wrestle each other to the ground and just punch each other in the face with it, the sword that is.

62
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,232
Guest: And I was like okay, so that didn't go anywhere.

63
00:14:02,352 --> 00:14:16,004
Guest: and then so I wrote another game called Slaves to Armok, God of Blood and this one actually started doing well, not well, meaning that I actually got some code down again since Drag Slay, I hadn't really done that with a fantasy game.

64
00:14:17,308 --> 00:14:34,137
Guest: So this is when I went online, that was when I started grad school, so I went online in 2000 and I put that game up and I'm like okay, it was just total alpha, just being able to walk around or something, it wasn't very much to it at all.

65
00:14:34,418 --> 00:14:57,895
Guest: but it had all these, the creature definitions were over specified, you could say how patchy someone's hair was on their arm and then what material the hair was made out of and what its density was and its colour and whether it was striped and so on and it kind of could generate random monsters and tell them how to walk with their, I had little 3D models eventually and it was kind of like a really bad version of Spore.

66
00:14:57,955 --> 00:15:06,993
Guest: but you could walk on your hand or you could walk on one leg or walk on your head in one leg or something and it would kind of bend the model and stuff to do that.

67
00:15:07,013 --> 00:15:10,303
Guest: but I was really focused on these, really this minutia.

68
00:15:11,246 --> 00:15:58,132
Guest: but that was all of our fantasy game design stuff was being invested in that and I put up these huge development pages, kind of like the ones I got now for Dwarf Fortress, these things are just paragraphs and paragraphs and paragraphs saying oh what do we want to do, what do we want to do and my brother and I, my brother Zach would write these stories and just kind of look at them and say okay, now if we wanted this to happen in a game, exactly what game mechanics would we need to make this game happen, if you're like yeah the adventurer is running around a cave and this giant bear attacked him and then they wrestled for a while and eventually somehow the adventurer managed to beat the bear to death with a stick which wouldn't happen of course.

69
00:15:58,173 --> 00:16:09,936
Guest: but then he skinned the bear, put on the bear's skin and ran outside or something, it's very simple, it's not, I wouldn't call that a rewarding game experience but if it was pulled off well it would be.

70
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:19,190
Guest: but there's already, just in that stupid little anecdote or whatever, there's dozens of game mechanics that you need to make that happen.

71
00:16:20,471 --> 00:16:35,413
Guest: because, I mean like I said before, we aren't really into sort of scripting what would happen so that it would just be something that happened on like level 3, you meet the big grizzly bear and then you kill it and then you get the item, bear pelt or something because you're like victorious or something.

72
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:44,300
Guest: but so we just had all these plans and you really learn early on that when you're making games.

73
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:51,087
Guest: that ideas, it's kind of like dime a dozen right, it's not, I mean everyone's got ideas for games, everyone wants to, not everyone.

74
00:16:51,107 --> 00:16:55,726
Guest: but you play games long enough and you get a bunch of ideas about how you make them better.

75
00:16:56,348 --> 00:17:00,362
Guest: but actually sitting down and doing it's a chore, I mean it's a lot of work.

76
00:17:01,164 --> 00:17:05,300
Guest: so we had all these ideas and we actually, we started to proceed with it.

77
00:17:05,382 --> 00:17:25,737
Guest: but the game started getting bogged down for a variety of reasons, this is the original Armok, I was messing with 3D graphics way too early in the development so I was just getting too concerned about how things would end up looking and I didn't really think about the larger scope of the game when I was messing around with these little details.

78
00:17:26,239 --> 00:17:36,210
Guest: and so that game was kind of grinding along and it had a bunch of bugs and I hadn't really programmed, this was the first game I released, well aside from this tragic game we released on AOL in 1996 that we don't need to talk about.

79
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,729
Scott: No I'm interested, I may have played that game.

80
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:44,847
Guest: Yeah who knows, it was kind of like, what's that game, attacks with like.

81
00:17:44,907 --> 00:17:57,620
Guest: you move the circle and then it converts all the other circles next to it, you can find it in bars sometimes and it was kind of like that, it was called Loser Ball but it was a horrible game, we wrote it when we were in high school so people played it, yeah well.

82
00:18:00,691 --> 00:18:07,690
Scott: I remember going on AOL and going to the games and there'd be that list of games you could get and you'd download every single one you've never downloaded before.

83
00:18:08,392 --> 00:18:09,541
Rym: Unless you had a 2400 baud modem like me.

84
00:18:12,011 --> 00:18:21,770
Guest: We got an email actually from some soldiers in Iraq in like 2005 and they were like yeah we're playing this game Loser Ball, it's really great, and I was like oh man, that was crazy.

85
00:18:24,611 --> 00:18:31,455
Guest: So I had never really had to work with actually having people play my games aside from my friends.

86
00:18:31,595 --> 00:18:33,621
Guest: so it was an educational experience.

87
00:18:33,681 --> 00:18:36,008
Guest: but that game was sort of sputtering.

88
00:18:36,028 --> 00:18:55,793
Guest: but this was over a period of years, I released that in 2000, the first Armach in 2000, and that went up to say, I don't quite remember, it would be 2004 or 2005 or 2006, it was just kind of going along well, and during that time I released various small projects just kind of as jokes.

89
00:18:55,874 --> 00:19:00,488
Guest: mostly, I think almost every other project on the web page right now is a joke of some kind.

90
00:19:03,711 --> 00:19:10,709
Guest: So that was where our fantasy game was, we always wanted to write this fantasy game and that's kind of what was happening to it.

91
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:50,930
Guest: Now at the same time in 2002 in October, I had this other game sitting around that I didn't release called Mutant Miner where there's this game called VGA Miner which is a pretty simple game, you have a grid that you look at, you're looking at a cross section of a mountain, it has this little store or something on top and a little miner and you can go down this elevator and then you can kind of dig in, again like Dig Dug or something at any stage, I think it was turn based though, and dig a hole in the mountain and find, there's little hazards or you can find jewels and bring them back.

92
00:19:51,351 --> 00:20:41,994
Guest: So I'm like okay, that game kind of gave me an idea to write something like that, this is again just a silly game I was writing, just an ASCII game where you would have a miner and you'd mine down into the rocks and get some kind of radioactive material and then you'd go back up and apply it to yourself so you could grow more arms and stuff, bear with me, and go down and fight various creatures down there and stuff, it's just kind of this weird thing, sort of like a rogue-like game or something, but it's just this very weird game that I was just messing around with because I just have hundreds of these little projects where I just see how something goes.

93
00:20:42,777 --> 00:21:15,897
Guest: and then I worked on that for about a week and then I was like well, wouldn't it be better if you were kind of mining but you were just dwarves or something, because with mutant miners turn based and you could get more miners but then you'd be controlling two things in a turn based mode and then that just ends up like one of those old SSI games and it gets really boring, where you just move this guy and then move this guy and there's like 50 orcs and it takes forever, so I was like okay, this needs to be real time.

94
00:21:15,978 --> 00:21:23,029
Guest: and then I kind of got this idea to make it more like dwarves, like you're controlling dwarves and so this weird mutant crap.

95
00:21:23,069 --> 00:21:48,159
Guest: and I'm like it would be fun just to kind of have a cliff face that you mine into and you can hit various metals and so on but there are just threats in the mountain and so on, but you can make crafts and so on, and then I had that other, kind of the main idea from our perspective which was now what if you could abandon that cave?

96
00:21:48,179 --> 00:22:04,068
Guest: and then we always have this idea of like I was saying, persistent score lists and so on and information about what happened after you die, like I had this other game which was, what was that one called?

97
00:22:04,108 --> 00:22:10,782
Guest: Beast, now that wasn't Beast Maimers, that was a different one, it was Fantasy Slaughter, Fantasy.

98
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:33,140
Guest: Yeah, so you had, this one was, you had just a bunch of kind of cards, just these boxes and they'd say things like forest on them and then you click on that and it expands it into eight more cards which would be like a grove or a cave or whatever and you fight opponents and so on, pretty simple.

99
00:22:33,301 --> 00:23:03,026
Guest: but the main thing was that when you died, instead of just saying okay you got 200 points, enter your name, you could click on your character and it would give a huge list of everything that had happened and all the creatures that you'd fought and it would have another score list, let's say the guy who's killed the most goblins, the guy who's killed the most dragons, the person who had the highest strength or whatever and it had all of these kind of charts and lists and stuff.

100
00:23:03,628 --> 00:23:11,147
Guest: and so I was thinking in this Dwarfs game, originally this Dwarfs game that was just made off Mutant Miner was going to be something short, I'd released a bunch of projects by then.

101
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:15,790
Guest: so I was like okay let me release another little game while I'm kind of grinding through this Armot game.

102
00:23:17,993 --> 00:23:27,731
Guest: so I was working on Dwarfs and I'm like okay now how can we do a score list for this game, you want to say how many crafts you've got and what kind of monsters you've killed and so on.

103
00:23:27,771 --> 00:23:55,567
Guest: and so I was like well wouldn't it be cool if you could go in there after you've lost, go in with an adventurer and have the adventurer kind of find things like find a piece of a log book that says what was produced or somebody's diary or something, just find all these little things or pick up a golden goblet and then bring it back to some just town menu, not even a place you could walk around and just turn that in.

104
00:23:55,868 --> 00:24:02,820
Guest: and the more things you find as you play your Dwarf thing, the more information you have about the main game, the Dwarf game that you had played.

105
00:24:03,463 --> 00:24:13,654
Guest: and so this was going to be a short little sort of two month project that just kind of showed a new way of handling a high score list, just something interesting like that.

106
00:24:14,637 --> 00:24:25,656
Guest: and so right after I thought of that I called up my brother and we talked about it for three days just kind of not sleeping at all, just all the different things you could do with a mechanism like that.

107
00:24:26,459 --> 00:24:43,719
Guest: and it basically grew into something where we were like yeah but we're working on Armok and this is kind of turning into another fantasy game and we're just kind of stepping on our own toes by working on this, we always have this problem where we come up with an idea but they can always be merged into some other mammoth project or whatever.

108
00:24:44,422 --> 00:25:05,315
Guest: and so we sort of shelved Dwarves for a while, worked on it in October 2002 and November and then just sort of shelved it, went back to Armok and did various other games that are floating around online, I don't remember the timeline but there's games like World War I Medic and Liberal Crime Squad and all those sub games like Fuck You and stuff.

109
00:25:05,415 --> 00:25:27,962
Guest: and the Dwarves kind of dropped off for a while and then around I don't remember 2004 or something, Armok was obviously sputtering at that time and so we decided okay we're going to go with this ASCII game, not mess around with this 3D crap anymore, maybe later when things are more settled.

110
00:25:28,664 --> 00:25:45,386
Guest: and so we started pushing all of our fantasy ideas into Dwarf Fortress and this time we were sort of keeping in mind that we should have a skeleton of the larger game, like get the world down early, get the civilizations down early instead of trying to build it up from the bottom.

111
00:25:45,928 --> 00:25:50,651
Guest: so kind of have a more flesh out the skeleton approach rather than starting from the bottom and working up.

112
00:25:53,478 --> 00:26:11,849
Guest: and so those ideas merged and then we're just suddenly back on track with our fantasy game and worked on that for a year or two and released it in August of 2006 and we've just kind of been working on that project ever since.

113
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:21,858
Rym: So to get back to the game itself specifically, I do notice one thing when I load it up to play it, that it takes over one of my cores and it uses it as much as it can.

114
00:26:21,939 --> 00:26:25,339
Rym: so it seems like there's a lot going on under the hood in this game.

115
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:27,964
Guest: Oh yeah, yeah.

116
00:26:27,984 --> 00:26:34,401
Guest: I mean whether or not that's my fault or that's a good thing is probably a kind of a 50/50 thing.

117
00:26:34,422 --> 00:26:35,744
Guest: I have no training as a programmer.

118
00:26:35,764 --> 00:26:58,974
Guest: When I went to school I took some computer classes or whatever, just the ones that I went to University of Washington for my undergrad and they don't let you take computer classes unless you're a computer major aside from say the lower like intro to C or whatever.

119
00:26:59,776 --> 00:27:04,380
Guest: and so I took all those and didn't really learn anything because I knew that stuff but I couldn't really learn anything.

120
00:27:04,501 --> 00:27:09,286
Guest: fancy of course you can learn online and I've been doing that but you always have holes and problems and stuff.

121
00:27:09,307 --> 00:27:13,689
Guest: I mean I'm getting better at it but I wouldn't call myself a programmer by any stretch of the imagination.

122
00:27:14,372 --> 00:27:15,940
Guest: and so yeah, I mean there's going to be problems.

123
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:23,764
Guest: I mean I've been looking at optimizing stuff but sometimes it feels premature too since so much is changing all the time.

124
00:27:24,166 --> 00:27:25,952
Guest: but yeah, there's a lot going on.

125
00:27:25,992 --> 00:27:33,420
Guest: I mean whether you're talking about when you're playing the game itself, I mean it's doing all kinds of stuff.

126
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:44,185
Guest: I mean aside from the stuff that you'd expect like pathfinding and so on, I mean it's worrying about weather patterns in the world itself because if the world – the world is kind of running at the same time.

127
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:57,211
Guest: It's not running too hard because you can't really devote too much processor to that but things will occasionally make little decisions, not so much right now because that's what I just started working on is this whole army thing.

128
00:27:57,251 --> 00:28:00,443
Guest: but the – weather is important.

129
00:28:01,447 --> 00:28:08,192
Guest: It's not that important but later on if there's hurricanes and tornadoes and stuff, it will be more important to have that stuff traced accurately.

130
00:28:08,212 --> 00:28:25,592
Guest: and so it spends – say it's devoting five, six, seven percent to this weather sim and there's other things like that that it's just got running and I basically make it do as much as I can get away with on my own machine and still sort of play it comfortably.

131
00:28:26,234 --> 00:28:41,947
Guest: but yeah, it just – I mean it will take what you give it basically and the game itself that you're actually playing like having a hundred dwarves trying to figure out where they want to go and what they want to do and all that kind of stuff.

132
00:28:42,048 --> 00:28:44,515
Guest: I mean if your map is like 400 by 400 then by –.

133
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:47,284
Guest: well now there's three coordinates.

134
00:28:47,324 --> 00:28:49,071
Guest: so 400 by 400 by 10 or something.

135
00:28:49,613 --> 00:28:54,393
Guest: then the pathfinding is expensive and you've got these fluids, the fluids.

136
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:58,937
Guest: if you've got an actual river flowing and then you divert it and you've got all this water flowing around.

137
00:28:58,957 --> 00:29:06,407
Guest: Yeah, it's just going to – yeah, it's going to eat your processor and I don't know the first thing about multi-threading an application.

138
00:29:06,487 --> 00:29:13,440
Guest: so if it's killing one of your cores that's because I don't know how to make it kill half of both your cores or something.

139
00:29:17,083 --> 00:29:28,580
Rym: Well actually I have a kind of a quick question here because it seems like if everything is so complex and there's a lot of – there is a lot going on and have your dwarves when you've been developing or watching the game ever done unexpected things?

140
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:34,352
Guest: Well I mean there's all kinds of categories, right?

141
00:29:34,392 --> 00:29:43,404
Guest: There's the category of what we're all trying to make happen, emergent behavior, it's just – not really, that hasn't happened.

142
00:29:43,444 --> 00:29:43,968
Guest: so much for me.

143
00:29:44,008 --> 00:29:45,480
Guest: I kind of understand why they're doing what they're doing.

144
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:55,008
Guest: But if there was a bug report for instance, a farmer walked over to a store room, picked up a bed, walked over to the fields and then planted it.

145
00:29:58,457 --> 00:29:59,841
Guest: I would say I didn't expect that.

146
00:29:59,962 --> 00:30:00,887
Guest: I didn't expect that at all.

147
00:30:00,907 --> 00:30:03,260
Guest: I wouldn't expect that in a thousand years but it happened.

148
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,418
Scott: Did it grow up that tree?

149
00:30:05,881 --> 00:30:07,646
Guest: No, it just sat there like you'd expect.

150
00:30:11,097 --> 00:30:11,960
Guest: Just planted the bed.

151
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,099
Rym: The other dwarves are standing around, what do we do with him?

152
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,443
Guest: Yeah, yeah.

153
00:30:16,743 --> 00:30:23,757
Guest: I mean I guess the answer to the question is yes.

154
00:30:24,699 --> 00:30:26,626
Guest: There's things like that all the time.

155
00:30:26,706 --> 00:30:41,541
Guest: It's just – I mean people on the forums have kind of remarked that the game, when it has bugs and it does, of course lots of bugs especially since this latest big release, that they can be spectacular and funny and stuff, just crazy, things like that.

156
00:30:42,826 --> 00:30:46,740
Guest: People spontaneously exploding because some temperature variable is wrong or whatever.

157
00:30:48,142 --> 00:30:54,949
Guest: And the upside to that though is that when things are working right, it all just kind of makes a little bit more sense or whatever.

158
00:30:55,351 --> 00:30:57,159
Guest: And things that are unexpected can happen.

159
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:14,854
Scott: So for a game of this variety, it's relatively popular and it's getting – there's a very – they're very critically claiming it, if you will.

160
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,720
Scott: So was that like a surprise?

161
00:31:17,663 --> 00:31:20,376
Scott: When did you notice that, "Oh, people actually like

162
00:31:20,417 --> 00:31:20,597
Scott: this.".

163
00:31:21,602 --> 00:31:24,932
Guest: Yeah, well it was kind of – I mean it was a pleasant surprise.

164
00:31:24,972 --> 00:31:29,526
Guest: I mean I didn't expect it to catch on quite so much.

165
00:31:29,546 --> 00:31:40,824
Guest: I mean I expected it to be because I kind of could play what I had sitting there and I knew it was better than anything else I'd released which isn't saying much.

166
00:31:41,185 --> 00:31:49,085
Guest: Then I knew it would go over all right but mostly just with people that were already playing my other games.

167
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:50,390
Guest: I just thought they'd like it more.

168
00:31:50,731 --> 00:32:01,204
Guest: But the second we released it, that was August 8th, 2006, immediately people would just post it all over these bulletin boards.

169
00:32:01,705 --> 00:32:10,617
Guest: I got to learn how to use my website's referrals function and you see all these just threads, threads everywhere and stuff.

170
00:32:10,657 --> 00:32:20,353
Guest: And there's just kind of people talking about it everywhere and I had no experience with that kind of thing, no experience with – I'd never seen that happen.

171
00:32:20,373 --> 00:32:28,160
Guest: I don't really frequent any bulletin boards or anything so I'd never seen how this sort of word of mouth can spread stuff.

172
00:32:28,581 --> 00:32:30,546
Guest: And that was a total surprise.

173
00:32:32,411 --> 00:32:44,792
Guest: I knew we had something interesting but I didn't know how well it would be received especially because things like it doesn't have the typical assets you'd associate with a successful game.

174
00:32:44,812 --> 00:32:56,824
Guest: I mean I wouldn't exactly call it – I mean it's not a successful game really because I mean what if you have several thousand downloads, it's still a drop in the bucket.

175
00:32:57,266 --> 00:33:11,720
Guest: But the people that can tolerate the graphics and can somehow manage to get their certification on the interface and play it, they appreciate it.

176
00:33:11,761 --> 00:33:24,389
Guest: And I think because it's unusual and there's not a lot of things like it that they seem to talk about it a lot which is – it's kind of interesting because I'm fairly anti-social when it comes to my games.

177
00:33:24,409 --> 00:33:27,485
Guest: I don't really play MMOs and I don't play multiplayer stuff.

178
00:33:27,545 --> 00:33:31,362
Guest: I mean I hardly play anything anymore but just never really got into that whole scene.

179
00:33:31,402 --> 00:33:43,027
Guest: And so for a game like Dwarf Fortress which is designed as sort of the ultimate anti-social game because it's basically like an MMO, you don't have to play with other people in a sense.

180
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:44,395
Guest: That's what we're shooting for.

181
00:33:44,435 --> 00:33:57,340
Guest: It's not that right now but we're trying to make kind of this living world without people that people would still talk so much about it and so it was very gratifying to see that happen and surprising.

182
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:09,527
Rym: Now, programming considerations completely aside, would you think it would be interesting if someday, if somehow a game like this would work where multiple people existed in the same world at the same time?

183
00:34:09,888 --> 00:34:12,531
Rym: or is that just completely beyond what you care about right now?

184
00:34:14,444 --> 00:34:14,966
Guest: Well, okay.

185
00:34:15,045 --> 00:34:18,137
Guest: So I guess there's a bunch of different aspects to that.

186
00:34:18,338 --> 00:34:21,045
Guest: Now, what I personally care about, I don't care at all.

187
00:34:21,527 --> 00:34:39,147
Guest: Like multiplayer stuff for some reason, yeah, just not my thing, not my thing because I mean it can be very rewarding I guess to have people there that if they're really, really, really serious about role-playing and not breaking your immersion and stuff, then of course they're better than NPCs.

188
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:50,463
Guest: But the second someone talks about, I don't even know how to pronounce that, P-W-N, like pwning you and stuff, I've got a massive pwner.

189
00:34:50,724 --> 00:34:52,652
Guest: It's just like, it's, I mean, ah.

190
00:34:54,710 --> 00:35:03,815
Scott: I'm actually, I had the same question, but I'm thinking so much with Dwarf Fortress, I don't imagine it being on the level of people pwning each other, right?

191
00:35:03,855 --> 00:35:18,179
Scott: But more like you have the one big world, it's just that I have my fortress over here and you have your fortress over there and we're just, our fortresses exist at the same time and maybe our dwarves will meet each other and maybe stuff like that.

192
00:35:19,061 --> 00:35:21,230
Guest: Yeah, and I don't mean to cast any aspersions.

193
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:27,720
Guest: That's just my own, I just don't, I just can't get into online things for whatever reason, but people have been great about that stuff.

194
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:39,763
Guest: I mean, they've done what they can with what they've got right now, meaning people will save a game and send it to someone else and then they'll work on it for a year, then they'll save that world and send it to someone else and they get these kind of succession things going on.

195
00:35:39,843 --> 00:35:50,810
Guest: Another way that they play on the forums is, okay, I've started a fortress with seven dwarves and people sign up and I'll name them after you or whatever and then they'll report back their exploits and you get some huge ones.

196
00:35:51,251 --> 00:36:10,381
Guest: There's this really popular one where I think this was a succession game, meaning they passed the world on, called Boat Murdered which came off of Something Awful, I think, and they would just write these narratives in character about what happened on their turn and then they'd pass along and it was really funny.

197
00:36:11,865 --> 00:36:34,575
Guest: So people who are social, you know, I'm an exception here, will do things with other people with what they've got and it would be, you know, in a kind of ideal universe, it would be great if they could do whatever they wanted with the game, if they wanted to play in a world with another fortress and then just trade with each other or if they all wanted to jump in and be dwarves and play one fortress.

198
00:36:34,615 --> 00:36:54,187
Guest: I mean, I guess they were doing that sort of, in that game, Worm Online, I think that's what it's called, where they kind of can make their, I mean, it's got a lot of detail with the crafting and so on and they all make these little settlements and, you know, build little houses with each other and dig, you know, mine and so on.

199
00:36:54,307 --> 00:36:57,954
Guest: And so that kind of thing could exist.

200
00:36:57,994 --> 00:37:22,156
Guest: I mean, I don't see what's so exceptional about Dwarf Fortress in terms of the MMOs or whatever, just how you'd be able to, what, modify your environment is one thing that I guess is slightly unusual and the detail with the character arrangements, but I don't see what's so different about, I mean, they have persistent worlds and stuff.

201
00:37:22,176 --> 00:37:37,646
Guest: I don't know, I've never really played MMOs, so I couldn't tell you what's missing and what's, or really understand your question in the sense that I'm not sure what you're saying that DF would be like versus other MMOs or whatever.

202
00:37:37,666 --> 00:37:42,786
Scott: Well, in that, I'm just saying that the players wouldn't necessarily be competing with each other.

203
00:37:42,987 --> 00:37:55,360
Scott: They would just sort of be, you know, it would be basically enriching the world twice as quickly, you know, or because more people would be enriching the same exact world rather than, cause a lot of MMOs today, the world doesn't get enriched.

204
00:37:55,540 --> 00:38:02,049
Scott: The world is controlled by the developers and it's just people are walking around looking at it, you know, sort of like what you didn't like.

205
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:08,859
Scott: But you know, with Dwarf Fortress, if more people were in the same world at the same time, you know, it would sort of, yeah.

206
00:38:09,201 --> 00:38:11,654
Guest: Yeah, and that's the thing that kind of reminds me of Worm Online.

207
00:38:11,695 --> 00:38:13,240
Guest: I don't know if you guys have seen that one.

208
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,140
Guest: Yeah, I've never heard of it.

209
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:19,176
Guest: Yeah, it's, you might, I think it's W-U-R-M, but I don't know.

210
00:38:19,196 --> 00:38:23,635
Guest: There's so many ways to spell worm, you know, that I don't remember how they spell it.

211
00:38:23,655 --> 00:38:26,119
Guest: You can use a Y, you can use a U, you can use an O.

212
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,157
Scott: Yeah, it's a U, I just searched for it.

213
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:36,789
Guest: Yeah, so that game, I mean, it's not Dwarves, of course, and someone remarked that every single character looks like Jonathan Frakes or something.

214
00:38:37,812 --> 00:38:46,700
Guest: But you can, it's something along those lines, so it's not something that I'd feel, you know, like a trailblazer, really.

215
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,479
Guest: And I think some people do have some interesting ideas there that they're kind of running with.

216
00:38:52,260 --> 00:39:15,622
Guest: But at the same time, it didn't, I mean, it doesn't have the same kind of, I mean, yeah, well, I didn't want to hype my ultimate goals too much, but it's like, what I'm hoping to do is take it beyond sort of a settlement building game and really get some kind of plot arc type of things that develop naturally just through the motivations of the characters involved.

217
00:39:15,723 --> 00:39:27,515
Guest: But I didn't, I mean, I always feel a little hesitant talking about some of the things that I want to do because you get those people, like the guys that did the PR for Oblivion, that was just ridiculous.

218
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:35,232
Guest: That whole radiant AI thing, it's like, this guy will take the broom from the other guy and kill him or whatever, because he wants the broom.

219
00:39:35,292 --> 00:39:37,804
Guest: Is that, I mean, that's the, and they talked about how.

220
00:39:37,824 --> 00:39:42,310
Guest: it was sort of like a wild stallion that was unbridled and they just couldn't control it, so they had to take it out.

221
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:47,959
Guest: And it's like, that just sounds more like a garden variety bug or decision error to me or whatever.

222
00:39:51,761 --> 00:39:52,945
Guest: Well,

223
00:39:53,025 --> 00:40:08,570
Scott: I guess we'll have our obligatory discussion in the interface, but first, you know, when I started up the game, the first thing I noticed even before the, you know, amazing, you know, world creation thing happens is the opening animation with, you know, the dwarves hitting the thing with the hammer.

224
00:40:08,893 --> 00:40:09,560
Scott: How did you make that?

225
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:29,473
Guest: I just, I mean, the game, when you're playing the game, it's just a sequence of 80 by 25 ASCII things, and so I just drew those by hand, saved them, and the, no, it's just, so it's like any movie format, well I don't know much about movie formats, but it just has all the frames in a row, and, you know, you can compress it.

226
00:40:29,514 --> 00:40:40,039
Guest: however, but the different, so I just drew them, and it's at different times, of course, there's sound effects queued, and I'm using like the FMOD sound library, and I just record them in a microphone.

227
00:40:40,079 --> 00:41:39,980
Guest: that the sound there, I, somehow during grad school, I came upon a, I don't even know how to say it, a sarod or sarod, it's an Indian instrument, it's like a sitar, but it doesn't have frets, and it's like Ali Akbar Khan, they look kind of badass, this giant instrument, and I got one from somebody, and so that's what you hear, that noise, it's, I mean, I mostly play the guitar, but that was, that was kind of fun to mess around with, and I think the pick is just me flicking a soda can with my fingers, messing with it, we'll let it grow, but, yeah, so just drew it by hand, you know, it's, it didn't take too long, it took me a while, I had this like piece of paper, and all the different frames, there were like 200 frames or something, I just checked them off, you know, just went through it, but there's probably a better way to do it, but I tend to do things the slow and stupid way, but I just, you know, keep working on them, get them done.

228
00:41:41,040 --> 00:42:01,656
Scott: Alright, well, to get it out of the way, I think we should at least discuss the interface for like a minute or two, because the one thing, you know, when anyone plays this game, regardless of whatever else they say, you know, it is, the game is all ASCII, and it's, I mean, I needed a wiki to basically figure out how to play, you know, it was actually quite an excellent, helpful thing on the wiki to, you know, get me started, at least,

229
00:42:02,399 --> 00:42:15,320
Guest: and-- Yeah, no, that was, yeah, oh, sorry, I'm interrupting you, I was just gonna say, the wiki's a wonderful thing, I'm really, you know, happy that the community came together and put that together, because it's certainly, I'd have like six players right now for that.

230
00:42:16,041 --> 00:42:39,319
Scott: Yeah, and, you know, the one thing that most people, you know, a lot of people try to play the game, and even if they're intrigued by the idea, will be, you know, turned away because it's difficult, or even if they're not turned away, they'll still, it's sort of, your game is infamous for its not-so-good interface, and, you know, you seem to admit it's not so good, but, you know, what do you have to say to someone who, you know, sort of is scared of your game?

231
00:42:40,441 --> 00:43:16,780
Guest: Well, okay, so, I mean, there's people who are scared of it, and I would, you know, as it stands, I'd say, you know, that you're just a reasonable, rational person having a reasonable, rational game to something that's frightening, but it's, you know, and then after that, you know, you can, you know, give them, well, let's just, let's just, okay, so with the interface, there's a couple things.

232
00:43:17,920 --> 00:44:07,749
Guest: Number one, the game, the way I'm developing it, just the way I release it, the way I've released it early, is somewhat unusual, right, I mean, you don't see, I mean, if you had to look at projects and all the commercial games you've played, there's not really so many of them that'll release when they're, say, 25% done, and then continue to release after that, and so, it's sort of apples and oranges to compare it to a finished game, or to a game that says it's finished and you still throw the ball backwards or whatever, but it's, and it's one of those things where I've had to make a decision as far as how much time do I want to spend on the interface, keeping it polished, keeping it so that, you know, a person can do exactly what they want to do without thinking about it, and without, you know, thinking about the interface, and it's just.

233
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:59,929
Guest: everything works nicely, everything looks nice, you can do what you want to do, there aren't a lot of confusing menus, there aren't a lot of keys that are mapped this way in one place and this way in another place, you don't know how to scroll or whatever, all those things can be handled, and I'm aware of all those issues, it's not like I'm kind of myopic about it or some kind of autistic savant that doesn't know what an interface is or whatever, but it's, it's difficult for me to justify spending a lot of time keeping it polished when I'm going to gut, you know, 10% of the game here, 10% of the game there, and then suddenly I have to go back and spend two weeks retooling the interface, so I just try and keep it at a sort of baseline of playability which maybe isn't the same baseline other people would have for that, but it saves me a whole lot of time so that I can get where I want to go.

234
00:44:59,949 --> 00:45:30,602
Guest: Now I've made a concession here, it's not quite the concession people would want, that I've said, you know, this is where version 1 is, I've kind of distinguished version 1 and past version 1 goals, so for instance, people like magic in their fantasy universes, but there's not going to be any before I get to the interface, and people want to play things besides dwarves, they want to play humans, of course they can model this right now, but they want to play humans, they want to play goblins, they want to play a god or whatever, not going to happen until I get to the interface.

235
00:45:31,665 --> 00:45:38,183
Guest: So at some point I am going to sit down and try and get something built on top of the game.

236
00:45:38,203 --> 00:45:49,504
Guest: that will be nice, but at the same time not hamstring me too much when I try and do more, but there's still going to be an element of that, which is why I don't want to rush it.

237
00:45:51,068 --> 00:46:10,885
Guest: Any time you've got a really good interface that's been designed specifically for the game in question, and if the game in question is changing then it's difficult to keep the interface applicable as you change things without spending time on it.

238
00:46:10,905 --> 00:46:25,809
Guest: So there's certainly a lot I could learn about how to make the interface update itself and work with the ever-changing format, but there's always going to be an element there making me uncomfortable with spending too much time on it.

239
00:46:25,829 --> 00:46:35,276
Guest: But it's not something I have all the answers to though, it's not an easy question, right?

240
00:46:35,797 --> 00:46:43,785
Guest: It kind of makes sense I guess, but I don't know if I missed the... there was some other element of the question though I guess.

241
00:46:43,805 --> 00:46:44,747
Scott: I think you covered it.

242
00:46:45,409 --> 00:46:46,031
Guest: Yeah, whatever.

243
00:46:46,232 --> 00:46:46,713
Guest: In the long run, not

244
00:46:47,094 --> 00:47:06,103
Scott: in terms of how you want the game to develop or what features you want in the game, but in terms of do you want to sell the game, do you want some publisher to sell it, do you want to get bought, do you want to work for some other game company, what's your long term goal here

245
00:47:06,965 --> 00:47:08,791
Guest: if you have any?

246
00:47:08,831 --> 00:47:17,259
Guest: No, I've had people approach me, they wanted to publish the game and had people want to put ads on the site and all that kind of stuff.

247
00:47:17,319 --> 00:47:25,092
Guest: I just don't want to... because people have had more ideas that are even more simple, just like why don't you sell t-shirts or something.

248
00:47:25,132 --> 00:47:26,660
Guest: People really want to buy t-shirts or whatever.

249
00:47:27,322 --> 00:47:30,289
Guest: I just didn't want to get... hello?

250
00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:31,071
Scott: We're here.

251
00:47:31,933 --> 00:47:32,575
Guest: Oh yeah, I just heard...

252
00:47:32,595 --> 00:47:35,846
Scott: I'd buy a t-shirt that takes a lady dwarf on it.

253
00:47:36,489 --> 00:47:41,613
Guest: Yeah, no, a lot of people wouldn't, it's cool, but I don't want to be a manager of sales or something, right?

254
00:47:41,653 --> 00:47:45,608
Guest: I don't want to deal with returns and I don't want to do that kind of stuff.

255
00:47:45,708 --> 00:47:51,994
Guest: And as far as commercializing the game, that sounds like a good way just to throw it down the toilet or whatever, right?

256
00:47:52,094 --> 00:48:06,002
Guest: It's like the second you get other people involved that have a vested interest in the project, then it becomes... you've got deadlines and you've got to worry about pleasing your masters and all that kind of thing.

257
00:48:06,704 --> 00:48:16,520
Guest: I got out of my job, I quit my job so that I could do this and I didn't want to have to turn it back into another job or something, so I'm not going to sell any games.

258
00:48:17,463 --> 00:48:18,505
Guest: We're never going to sell a game.

259
00:48:19,288 --> 00:48:24,082
Guest: And I like how it's set up now, how people can download the game.

260
00:48:24,283 --> 00:48:30,585
Guest: Anyone anywhere who's got an internet connection and a computer that has a 27 gigahertz processor can play the game.

261
00:48:31,508 --> 00:48:43,287
Guest: And they can download it, play it, try it, and if they like it, if they really like it, if it meets with their satisfaction, they can assign a dollar value to the game and send me money.

262
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:44,792
Guest: People do that.

263
00:48:44,852 --> 00:48:50,760
Guest: I'm surprised that last year I actually made about as much as I made when I was a grad student.

264
00:48:52,582 --> 00:48:57,480
Rym: One thing I can definitely say is the community you've got is very dedicated to this game.

265
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:01,149
Guest: Yeah, I mean it's an unusual game, right?

266
00:49:01,169 --> 00:49:07,532
Guest: So if it's your cup of tea, there's not a lot out there that can compete with it, if it's your thing.

267
00:49:08,174 --> 00:49:13,312
Guest: I mean it's not the thing of a lot of people, but the people that do like it, they like it a lot.

268
00:49:14,015 --> 00:49:30,505
Guest: It's got a lot of things that people have been wanting or had wanted to see tried, like scrapping hit points and the persistent world and dynamic fluids, all that kind of stuff that you might have wanted in your games.

269
00:49:31,048 --> 00:49:37,473
Guest: There's an attempt in Dwarf Fortress and some of it came off pretty well, so they support that.

270
00:49:37,493 --> 00:49:39,179
Guest: Yeah, it's pretty cool.

271
00:49:41,922 --> 00:49:44,470
Guest: I don't see it changing my business model.

272
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:49,668
Guest: Now, of course, this is me talking from a position of relative comfort.

273
00:49:49,688 --> 00:49:52,261
Guest: I mean it's not a lot of money, but I can pay rent on it.

274
00:49:52,842 --> 00:49:59,884
Guest: Now, if I'm driven against the wall, who knows what kind of creepy corporate flunky I'll turn into or whatever, right?

275
00:49:59,904 --> 00:50:01,489
Guest: You never know.

276
00:50:01,509 --> 00:50:11,224
Guest: I can already see myself saying, "Well, if I make just 200 bucks a month for three months, doesn't that mean it's about time to start working on the interface or

277
00:50:11,244 --> 00:50:14,175
Guest: something?".

278
00:50:14,215 --> 00:50:16,822
Guest: The answer to that question is probably yes, even before then.

279
00:50:20,168 --> 00:50:28,206
Guest: Still, I'm trying to remain dedicated to my principles here, which is try before you buy.

280
00:50:28,226 --> 00:50:30,292
Guest: I really think that's important.

281
00:50:31,055 --> 00:50:42,231
Guest: People shouldn't have to pay for something because somebody tried to stuff it down their throat or lied about it, like those things we were talking about with the Plimian.

282
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:44,360
Guest: I wouldn't call him a liar, but shit.

283
00:50:45,001 --> 00:50:47,974
Scott: Well, actually, we're kind of running out of time, so let's just ask a few more.

284
00:50:47,994 --> 00:50:53,140
Scott: Have you thought about taking the game open source anyway?

285
00:50:54,243 --> 00:50:57,170
Guest: That's been a huge discussion on and off here.

286
00:50:59,836 --> 00:51:12,148
Guest: Of course, there are upsides to that, but the main downside is that I don't know what would happen in terms of people branching it or people doing whatever with it.

287
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:25,328
Guest: It's just that unpredictability of it and the fact that I'm living on this now makes me very hesitant to jump into, "I feel suddenly very protective of what I've got

288
00:51:25,388 --> 00:51:25,729
Guest: going.".

289
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:41,453
Guest: Of course, if you release a source but you're like, "Don't branch it," and you write some kind of tricky license agreement or something and you're willing to go to court and you have money to go to court and stuff like that, then you can actually do that.

290
00:51:41,654 --> 00:51:43,544
Guest: Then, all of a sudden, you're some kind of saint or something.

291
00:51:43,564 --> 00:51:49,110
Guest: It's like, "Yes, I've released open source for the world or whatever," and everyone should do that.

292
00:51:49,511 --> 00:51:54,846
Guest: Releasing open source is a great thing, but you don't have certain luxuries sometimes.

293
00:51:56,230 --> 00:52:12,100
Guest: At my core, if we were living in some kind of utopia where we were all supported, we all had food and stuff like that, basic stuff, then it'd be open source in a second, but we're just not in that situation.

294
00:52:12,461 --> 00:52:12,702
Rym: All right.

295
00:52:12,722 --> 00:52:24,875
Rym: I guess at this point, we usually tend to get back away from the normal topic and ask a bunch of geeky personal questions.

296
00:52:25,697 --> 00:52:28,405
Rym: I think the answer may be self-evident, but are you a geek?

297
00:52:28,425 --> 00:52:31,520
Rym: You definitely are very dedicated to computer gaming.

298
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:31,840
Rym: Yes.

299
00:52:32,001 --> 00:52:57,452
Guest: These terms, and all through high school, I think it's because my father didn't really -- just how his life went or whatever -- it's always been heavy into not having us just raise -- not to self-identify with any group of people.

300
00:52:58,915 --> 00:53:02,446
Guest: When people use labels and so on, I've never called myself a geek.

301
00:53:02,646 --> 00:53:10,654
Guest: I'm pretty sure I fit pretty squarely right in the center of there somewhere, but I just don't understand what it means.

302
00:53:10,694 --> 00:53:13,425
Guest: When people say things like, "Are you a geek?

303
00:53:13,486 --> 00:53:14,290
Guest: Are you an atheist?

304
00:53:14,370 --> 00:53:15,175
Guest: Are you a something?

305
00:53:15,255 --> 00:53:15,537
Guest: Are you a

306
00:53:15,577 --> 00:53:15,838
Guest: something?"

307
00:53:15,858 --> 00:53:18,728
Guest: It's like, "I don't

308
00:53:18,748 --> 00:53:18,949
Guest: know.".

309
00:53:19,069 --> 00:53:21,800
Guest: The specific questions would really tease that out, I guess.

310
00:53:24,061 --> 00:53:26,273
Rym: I'm just really interested in how people perceive that word.

311
00:53:26,334 --> 00:53:30,180
Rym: It seems like everyone we ask has a very different, but similarly long-winded answer.

312
00:53:31,281 --> 00:53:32,788
Guest: Yeah, I've got no definition for it.

313
00:53:32,848 --> 00:53:34,696
Guest: Especially when you get, "What is a geek?

314
00:53:34,736 --> 00:53:35,018
Guest: What is a

315
00:53:35,118 --> 00:53:35,399
Guest: nerd?".

316
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:36,243
Guest: That kind of stuff.

317
00:53:36,364 --> 00:53:40,683
Guest: I don't understand distinctions and stuff, and people get violent over that kind of thing.

318
00:53:40,724 --> 00:53:43,055
Guest: Violent in the way that they yell at each other and stuff.

319
00:53:43,095 --> 00:53:44,562
Guest: It's like, "I don't know.

320
00:53:44,743 --> 00:53:45,105
Guest: I don't know,

321
00:53:45,146 --> 00:53:45,347
Guest: man.".

322
00:53:45,487 --> 00:53:46,554
Guest: It's just like, "I like what I

323
00:53:46,574 --> 00:53:47,097
Guest: like.".

324
00:53:47,117 --> 00:53:49,668
Guest: If someone fixes cars all day and stuff, I think they're kind of nerdy.

325
00:53:51,054 --> 00:53:52,420
Guest: It's kind of a geeky thing, right?

326
00:53:52,922 --> 00:53:54,039
Scott: Cars are -- That's what we say.

327
00:53:54,921 --> 00:53:55,223
Guest: Yeah.

328
00:53:55,404 --> 00:53:56,167
Guest: It's like, "Whatever.

329
00:53:56,187 --> 00:53:56,368
Guest: I don't

330
00:53:56,388 --> 00:53:56,509
Guest: know.".

331
00:53:56,609 --> 00:54:00,456
Guest: There's some kind of stratification or something that, "I don't know,

332
00:54:00,476 --> 00:54:00,537
Guest: man.".

333
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:06,757
Scott: You're obviously interested in fantasy and computers and video games.

334
00:54:06,817 --> 00:54:10,580
Scott: What are the sorts of things you're interested in that you do, or do you do anything else?

335
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:13,346
Guest: Well, okay.

336
00:54:13,768 --> 00:54:18,404
Guest: Maybe before -- no, I still do a few things, because I've become kind of this monk, right?

337
00:54:18,765 --> 00:54:20,672
Guest: I don't leave my house very often.

338
00:54:20,692 --> 00:54:27,376
Guest: I can go through days without speaking to anybody except for my brother when we're planning stuff.

339
00:54:27,396 --> 00:54:31,410
Guest: I've become kind of devoted to the project, because it's something I think is worthwhile.

340
00:54:32,634 --> 00:54:33,938
Guest: I play the guitar.

341
00:54:34,139 --> 00:54:38,595
Guest: That was something I picked up in, what was that, 2003 or something.

342
00:54:38,615 --> 00:54:44,181
Guest: I started doing flamenco, but after that, it just kind of turned into stuff that sounds mostly like the Dwarf Fortress music.

343
00:54:45,264 --> 00:54:50,438
Guest: Just kind of random, eerie sort of stuff, just kind of dipping around.

344
00:54:50,699 --> 00:54:52,365
Guest: It's all improvised, basically.

345
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:56,540
Guest: I spent some time on that song a little bit, just to make sure.

346
00:54:57,342 --> 00:55:04,249
Guest: When you're improvising, it can go well for three or four minutes, and then you do something really stupid, and then it doesn't sound so good anymore.

347
00:55:04,289 --> 00:55:08,478
Guest: That's something that I've been really into.

348
00:55:10,421 --> 00:55:12,688
Guest: What other types of geeky things do I do?

349
00:55:12,708 --> 00:55:20,120
Guest: I got this friend in the UK kind of turned me on to anime and manga and stuff, so I've done some stuff with that.

350
00:55:20,787 --> 00:55:22,080
Rym: What anime do you like, briefly?

351
00:55:24,021 --> 00:55:26,206
Guest: Briefly, yeah.

352
00:55:26,306 --> 00:55:33,386
Guest: It's difficult to come up with top lists and everything, but I've liked almost all the Miyazaki stuff I've seen.

353
00:55:34,531 --> 00:55:36,640
Guest: I liked Utena a lot.

354
00:55:37,721 --> 00:55:39,599
Rym: That's pretty much my favorite show ever done.

355
00:55:40,341 --> 00:55:41,808
Guest: Yeah, I don't watch it again.

356
00:55:41,828 --> 00:55:45,023
Guest: I should watch it again, because it was badass, but I remember I was watching that.

357
00:55:45,083 --> 00:55:52,905
Guest: We kind of put it on at the same time, because he's over in the UK, and we'd just be on IRC or something, and we put it on at the same time, and we're just like, "Oh!

358
00:55:53,166 --> 00:55:53,669
Guest: Oh, damn!

359
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:54,072
Scott: How?

360
00:55:54,213 --> 00:55:54,897
Scott: What the hell was

361
00:55:54,937 --> 00:55:55,199
Scott: that?".

362
00:55:55,827 --> 00:55:56,620
Rym: We know that feeling.

363
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:58,784
Guest: Yeah, so that was badass.

364
00:55:58,885 --> 00:56:00,089
Guest: I like AsaManga a lot.

365
00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:00,852
Guest: That's funny.

366
00:56:02,457 --> 00:56:06,934
Guest: Various other stuff, various other stuff, I guess, but those are the kind of ones that come off.

367
00:56:06,954 --> 00:56:11,320
Guest: If someone had to ask me my top three things or whatever, I guess those are it.

368
00:56:12,183 --> 00:56:17,819
Scott: Do you play any other video games besides Dwarf Fortress, or maybe you play tabletop role-playing games or something like that?

369
00:56:18,461 --> 00:56:20,265
Guest: Yeah, let's see.

370
00:56:21,187 --> 00:56:27,922
Guest: When we were younger, we started off on D&D like the Red Box, I guess, was the first thing we had.

371
00:56:30,669 --> 00:56:32,593
Guest: We played that up through Second Edition, I guess.

372
00:56:32,613 --> 00:56:36,829
Guest: We had ... I don't remember what else we had.

373
00:56:36,869 --> 00:56:38,277
Guest: We had some Marvel stuff.

374
00:56:38,298 --> 00:56:39,222
Guest: I don't know if we ever played it.

375
00:56:39,462 --> 00:56:42,311
Guest: Then there was Cyberpunk I mentioned.

376
00:56:43,735 --> 00:56:45,180
Guest: We sort of drifted out of that.

377
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:56,820
Guest: I think it's because when I was in middle school, my brother was in high school, we had this kind of circle of friends that we grew up with, but then we just started moving.

378
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:58,325
Guest: We moved a couple of times.

379
00:56:59,028 --> 00:57:02,605
Guest: I didn't really have a group or whatever, and we just kind of dropped out of doing that.

380
00:57:03,509 --> 00:57:05,277
Guest: We weren't so much into role-playing, I guess.

381
00:57:05,297 --> 00:57:07,909
Guest: I never really adopted a persona or anything like that.

382
00:57:08,331 --> 00:57:12,129
Guest: We kind of played it more like we'd play our ideal computer game or whatever.

383
00:57:12,169 --> 00:57:29,357
Guest: when there weren't ... There wasn't anything at the time, and then we started ... Once we became capable of not actually doing, but thinking about doing the things we wanted to do on a computer, we just sort of drifted away from that.

384
00:57:29,377 --> 00:57:31,625
Guest: I occasionally played again.

385
00:57:31,666 --> 00:57:37,847
Guest: I played a role-master game once when I was in college, I guess, but nothing for a long while.

386
00:57:38,268 --> 00:57:46,473
Guest: As far as other video games, I must have played a thousand-something video games when I was a kid, all kinds of stuff.

387
00:57:46,493 --> 00:57:47,979
Guest: We'd just download them off BBSs.

388
00:57:47,999 --> 00:57:52,233
Guest: We'd have these floppy disks with like 220K basic games on them or whatever.

389
00:57:52,253 --> 00:57:58,319
Guest: I'm playing the arcade all the time, just like drop five bucks, drop five bucks, drop five bucks or whatever.

390
00:58:01,223 --> 00:58:02,874
Scott: You weren't big in the console games, really?

391
00:58:03,035 --> 00:58:03,640
Scott: Mostly the PC?

392
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:04,563
Guest: Oh, yeah.

393
00:58:04,664 --> 00:58:08,465
Guest: I forgot about that, because when I was younger ... I don't have a console now, so I tend to forget about it, but no.

394
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:09,027
Guest: We had a VIC-20.

395
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:10,413
Guest: We had an Atari 2600.

396
00:58:10,413 --> 00:58:10,915
Guest: We had a Nintendo.

397
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:17,359
Guest: We had a Super Nintendo, I think, and we had tons of games, tons of cartridges.

398
00:58:17,399 --> 00:58:18,583
Guest: That stuff was all a lot of fun.

399
00:58:18,603 --> 00:58:24,886
Guest: I'm not sure I could go back to that now, but the ... I've seen people playing PlayStation 2s.

400
00:58:24,906 --> 00:58:28,802
Guest: I haven't seen much of the new stuff, the newest consoles that just came out.

401
00:58:28,823 --> 00:58:33,081
Guest: I've seen a Wii and a Best Buy, for example, but I've never used one.

402
00:58:36,149 --> 00:58:37,313
Guest: I'm not really sure.

403
00:58:37,333 --> 00:58:38,717
Guest: I haven't played any of that stuff.

404
00:58:38,757 --> 00:59:01,289
Guest: It's kind of expensive to get into it now, and I don't think I'd be so into it, but PC games kind of really into stuff in the '80s and then started dropping out when more of the shooters started coming out, I guess, and when things were just kind of ... It's the same kind of role-playing game, slightly improved, better graphics.

405
00:59:01,711 --> 00:59:02,595
Guest: Mechanics got better.

406
00:59:02,615 --> 00:59:12,578
Guest: I'm not going to start and talk about how there's sort of a golden age in the '80s or something, and then everything after that's just crap, and it's all graphics or whatever, because things get better.

407
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:13,523
Guest: Things have still gotten better.

408
00:59:13,543 --> 00:59:26,356
Guest: It's just slower than I would have liked, because something like ... Some of the things, if there's good things about Dwarf Fortress, good conceptual things that could have been tried, they should have been tried a long time ago.

409
00:59:26,376 --> 00:59:30,110
Guest: I don't see why there's not a lot of stuff like it or something.

410
00:59:30,813 --> 00:59:31,395
Guest: That's unusual.

411
00:59:31,978 --> 00:59:32,841
Guest: So I kind of dropped out.

412
00:59:32,922 --> 00:59:50,644
Guest: I mean, I'll still occasionally play things that are very sort of special interest, like I'll play Zoo Tycoon or something, because I've always liked zoos, just go and visit the animals or whatever, so stuff like that, or just some silly-ass Flash game where you just do whatever.

413
00:59:51,065 --> 00:59:55,054
Guest: But nothing, none of the real big titles.

414
00:59:55,075 --> 01:00:00,590
Guest: I mean, I kind of had ... I'm just following the, say, Ultima or something.

415
01:00:00,891 --> 01:00:01,934
Guest: Never played Ultima 1.

416
01:00:01,934 --> 01:00:02,877
Guest: I was too young.

417
01:00:03,499 --> 01:00:04,362
Guest: Ultima 2 didn't play that.

418
01:00:04,382 --> 01:00:07,654
Guest: Ultima 3 played that, really liked it.

419
01:00:07,755 --> 01:00:09,119
Guest: Ultima 4 was awesome.

420
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:10,364
Guest: It's one of my favorite computer games.

421
01:00:10,867 --> 01:00:12,875
Guest: Ultima 5, 6 is still good.

422
01:00:12,895 --> 01:00:13,979
Guest: Ultima 7 is good.

423
01:00:14,019 --> 01:00:15,802
Guest: Ultima 7, part 2, that was good.

424
01:00:15,822 --> 01:00:17,084
Guest: And then Ultima 8 happened, and we're like,

425
01:00:17,104 --> 01:00:17,224
Guest: "What?".

426
01:00:17,585 --> 01:00:23,928
Guest: I heard someone call it Super Avatar Brothers or whatever.

427
01:00:23,948 --> 01:00:25,936
Guest: It was like Jump Puzzles.

428
01:00:26,177 --> 01:00:26,860
Guest: I'm like, "Okay,

429
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:27,241
Guest: whatever.".

430
01:00:27,723 --> 01:00:30,093
Guest: I didn't buy 9, so I dropped off that.

431
01:00:30,334 --> 01:00:33,731
Guest: And then there's things like looking at Bethesda or something, we talked about that a little bit.

432
01:00:34,354 --> 01:00:39,189
Guest: Daggerfall was a game that made me feel like maybe someone was going to do the right thing or whatever.

433
01:00:39,209 --> 01:00:46,290
Guest: Someone's kind of moral way, but just something that I'd like.

434
01:00:46,993 --> 01:00:51,871
Guest: Something that was going to start moving and making things very, very interesting.

435
01:00:51,931 --> 01:00:55,003
Guest: And then Morrowind was kind of more scripted and more pretty.

436
01:00:55,164 --> 01:00:57,133
Guest: I still liked it, but it was not great.

437
01:00:57,334 --> 01:00:59,484
Guest: And then Oblivion, I just kind of dropped off on them.

438
01:01:00,148 --> 01:01:07,305
Guest: So this is the kind of thing where I'm just not ... I mean, I just wouldn't go out and buy a game these days because it would just be like, "Well, it's going to be a shooter.

439
01:01:07,325 --> 01:01:08,270
Guest: It's going to be an RTS.

440
01:01:08,692 --> 01:01:13,812
Guest: Maybe there's something interesting, but it's not going to blow my mind or anything.

441
01:01:14,454 --> 01:01:16,281
Guest: It's probably got DRM that'll eat my computer or

442
01:01:16,321 --> 01:01:16,622
Guest: something.".

443
01:01:16,642 --> 01:01:19,133
Guest: Yeah, that's what that was.

444
01:01:19,153 --> 01:01:20,419
Scott: How much time do we have over there?

445
01:01:20,439 --> 01:01:22,065
Rym: We should probably wrap it up right about now.

446
01:01:22,085 --> 01:01:23,471
Rym: All right.

447
01:01:23,491 --> 01:01:24,856
Scott: I actually have a question for me.

448
01:01:24,876 --> 01:01:28,010
Scott: I played Dwarf Fortress for ... Rym didn't play it, actually.

449
01:01:28,030 --> 01:01:28,834
Scott: He was too scared.

450
01:01:29,276 --> 01:01:34,595
Rym: I played- I read most of the wiki, however, because the thing is I find the game fascinating.

451
01:01:34,615 --> 01:01:40,139
Rym: Reading the wiki alone was just really interesting to see what other people tried and what happens.

452
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:42,934
Guest: There are people that just read forum threads and stuff.

453
01:01:42,954 --> 01:01:44,481
Guest: They're like, "I can't play this game.

454
01:01:45,184 --> 01:01:46,208
Guest: I just can't understand it.

455
01:01:46,389 --> 01:01:50,243
Guest: It's like I'm dyslexic and the ASCII move around or whatever and I just can't stand

456
01:01:50,283 --> 01:01:50,324
Guest: it.".

457
01:01:51,066 --> 01:01:55,498
Guest: But I love reading the stories or whatever.

458
01:01:55,638 --> 01:02:00,743
Guest: They'll just kind of talk on my forums and they'll chat with people about the game and stuff, but they've never played it.

459
01:02:00,763 --> 01:02:03,613
Scott: Yeah, I played it for a couple weeks.

460
01:02:04,215 --> 01:02:06,382
Scott: I followed with the wiki set.

461
01:02:06,402 --> 01:02:12,125
Scott: I basically got up to right before the wiki was telling me to make a little farm and make a flood or whatever.

462
01:02:13,308 --> 01:02:16,760
Scott: Basically, there were two problems I had where I couldn't continue.

463
01:02:17,602 --> 01:02:22,443
Scott: I figured out the interface just because I'm good at figuring out interfaces, at least the basics of it.

464
01:02:23,105 --> 01:02:27,799
Scott: The first thing was moving the rocks out of the digging place.

465
01:02:27,999 --> 01:02:31,232
Scott: I'd want to put a bed somewhere, but there'd be rocks in the way.

466
01:02:31,674 --> 01:02:33,602
Scott: They wouldn't move those rocks out of the way.

467
01:02:33,622 --> 01:02:35,211
Scott: They'd move some other rocks out of the way.

468
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:37,441
Scott: So what am I supposed to do about that?

469
01:02:38,284 --> 01:02:44,684
Guest: Yeah, so if you have set up a stone stockpile, a big one, they're just going to be moving rocks.

470
01:02:45,126 --> 01:02:45,789
Scott: I noticed that.

471
01:02:46,552 --> 01:02:50,246
Guest: Yeah, so that's kind of one of those things where I'm kind of just trying to decide.

472
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:54,341
Guest: The realism is important, but you shouldn't be a slave to it.

473
01:02:54,381 --> 01:02:56,425
Guest: So I'm like, "What should I do about

474
01:02:56,486 --> 01:02:56,967
Guest: this?".

475
01:02:56,987 --> 01:02:58,069
Guest: They need rocks or whatever.

476
01:02:58,109 --> 01:03:05,115
Guest: It's one of those things where you don't want to create a big stone stockpile.

477
01:03:05,135 --> 01:03:13,280
Guest: Just leave the rocks where they're at, and if you put a bed right on top of the rock and there's not a bunch of stone-hauling jobs, then they'll walk over to that bed, move the rock, stick it to the side.

478
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:14,684
Scott: Oh, will they?

479
01:03:14,945 --> 01:03:19,605
Scott: Because I would try to say, "Put a bed here," and it wouldn't let me do that because there was a rock there.

480
01:03:20,248 --> 01:03:22,538
Guest: Yeah, it's going to depend.

481
01:03:22,578 --> 01:03:30,193
Guest: I don't know when the last time you played was, too, because the versions constantly change, so I have to keep trying to... But that one's been like that for a while.

482
01:03:30,696 --> 01:03:32,083
Guest: They'll clean stuff, they'll keep it out of the way.

483
01:03:32,727 --> 01:03:38,258
Guest: And most people... Not most people, I don't know what percentage, but a lot of people will just leave the rocks because there's a lot of rocks.

484
01:03:38,318 --> 01:03:42,519
Guest: Especially in this new version, apparently the drop rate went way up, so there's...

485
01:03:42,862 --> 01:03:43,779
Scott: There's even more rocks.

486
01:03:44,501 --> 01:03:45,567
Guest: Yeah, it's torment.

487
01:03:45,628 --> 01:03:46,070
Guest: It's torment.

488
01:03:46,090 --> 01:03:47,016
Guest: It's one of the big problems.

489
01:03:47,076 --> 01:03:58,205
Guest: And there are a lot of things like that where there's just all these stumbling blocks along the way, and unless you get specifically either through them yourself or helped by someone else, you could drop the game.

490
01:03:58,686 --> 01:04:03,401
Guest: It's like I'm aware of these things, sympathetic and trying to figure out what to do.

491
01:04:03,421 --> 01:04:05,749
Guest: But yeah, that's one of the big problems.

492
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:13,834
Scott: The other problem I had was that I would know what I wanted to do.

493
01:04:14,134 --> 01:04:17,329
Scott: I'm like, "I want to dig this and this and this and this.

494
01:04:17,389 --> 01:04:19,402
Scott: I want to put this here and this here and this here and this here and this

495
01:04:19,442 --> 01:04:19,663
Scott: here.".

496
01:04:19,924 --> 01:04:28,599
Scott: But I couldn't... I'd already... I'd just want to design a room full of beds, sort of like in Railroad Tycoon, I wanted to design my roller coaster.

497
01:04:28,619 --> 01:04:31,479
Scott: But I couldn't do that until the beds were made, and I couldn't...

498
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:32,142
Guest: Exactly.

499
01:04:32,242 --> 01:04:32,704
Guest: Yeah, yeah.

500
01:04:32,724 --> 01:04:40,089
Guest: And that's a problem with some of the old... The way the jobs work, we have to deal with legacy code.

501
01:04:40,109 --> 01:04:41,616
Guest: That's part of the problem with Fortresses.

502
01:04:41,676 --> 01:04:44,060
Guest: You got five years worth of crap in there.

503
01:04:44,140 --> 01:04:51,837
Scott: It sort of ended up in a SimCity situation, where normally in SimCity, you pause the game, you do some stuff, and then you put it in cheetah mode and you walk away.

504
01:04:51,937 --> 01:04:54,576
Scott: But there isn't cheetah mode, there's pause and go.

505
01:04:55,220 --> 01:05:02,974
Guest: Yeah, you can't do it now because a job right now, the problem with the jobs is a job needs to know what items it's working with before it can begin.

506
01:05:03,115 --> 01:05:05,484
Guest: And when you place a building, it kind of needs to know.

507
01:05:05,544 --> 01:05:08,616
Guest: Now, I'm saying it needs to know in the code.

508
01:05:08,697 --> 01:05:14,419
Guest: In real life, back where we want this game to be, you would just... You'd be able to do that.

509
01:05:14,479 --> 01:05:23,525
Guest: And this is definitely going to come to a head and be fixed probably sooner rather than later because of the new constructions and ability to re-wall and place floors and ramps and stairs and build them out of stone.

510
01:05:24,629 --> 01:05:29,320
Guest: Because people want to lay down the entire blueprint for a giant bridge or something.

511
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:30,518
Scott: Yeah, that's exactly what I wanted to do.

512
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:33,356
Guest: They just want to wall, wall, wall, wall, wall.

513
01:05:33,376 --> 01:05:33,699
Guest: I don't care.

514
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:38,000
Scott: That was the most fun part of the game, was designing Fortresses and things.

515
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:39,785
Guest: Yeah.

516
01:05:39,845 --> 01:05:45,719
Guest: I don't set deadlines anymore because I've broken so many... I'm not going to get a date on anything.

517
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:49,331
Guest: Yeah, so it's like it's going to happen.

518
01:05:49,392 --> 01:05:55,638
Guest: That's one of those things where there's a lot of pressure and I'm down with it, everyone's down with it, and I've just got to do it.

519
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:59,360
Guest: So yeah, slowly, slowly the game will get better.

520
01:06:02,261 --> 01:06:04,109
Rym: Well, I guess I think that should be it.

521
01:06:04,471 --> 01:06:05,133
Rym: I want to thank you.

522
01:06:05,194 --> 01:06:06,379
Rym: That was fascinating.

523
01:06:06,419 --> 01:06:08,180
Rym: You're pretty well spoken, I must say.

524
01:06:08,821 --> 01:06:13,520
Scott: Yeah, I was worried because we never spoke to you, so we didn't know what you sounded like or anything.

525
01:06:13,780 --> 01:06:20,360
Guest: Yeah, you never know because someone who's working on a project like this, you drag them out of their cave, they might just hiss at the sunlight or something.

526
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:31,559
Rym: But to all our listeners out there, you should at least look at this game because the depths are kind of staggering if you got any indication from the last hour or so.

527
01:06:32,380 --> 01:06:34,147
Guest: Yeah, just look at the Wiki.

528
01:06:34,368 --> 01:06:37,641
Guest: Read that boat murdered, boat murdered like you killed somebody in the past.

529
01:06:37,681 --> 01:06:39,304
Guest: tense, thread.

530
01:06:39,945 --> 01:06:42,530
Guest: People tend to get introduced from that game.

531
01:06:42,570 --> 01:06:49,227
Guest: They kind of enjoy the game without even playing it.

532
01:06:49,247 --> 01:06:51,557
Guest: Because the interface is coming.

533
01:06:51,617 --> 01:06:54,768
Guest: It's not coming in your lifetime, but it's coming.

534
01:06:55,450 --> 01:06:58,540
Guest: So eventually you'll be able to actually play the game.

535
01:06:58,921 --> 01:07:00,266
Guest: But until then, it's something fun.

536
01:07:00,286 --> 01:07:02,856
Guest: It's like watching a movie or something.

537
01:07:03,077 --> 01:07:04,536
Guest: Just enjoying what's going on.

538
01:07:11,330 --> 01:07:13,520
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

539
01:07:13,621 --> 01:07:16,049
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music.

540
01:07:16,790 --> 01:07:27,970
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at www.frontroadcrew.com where you'll find show notes, links, our awesome forum, a link to our Frapper map, and links to all the RSS feeds.

541
01:07:28,590 --> 01:07:34,275
Rym: We say feeds plural because GeekNights airs four nights a week covering four different brands of geekery.

542
01:07:34,757 --> 01:07:36,404
Rym: Mondays are science and technology.

543
01:07:36,445 --> 01:07:39,075
Rym: Tuesdays we have video games, board games, and RPGs.

544
01:07:39,437 --> 01:07:41,525
Rym: Wednesdays are anime, manga, comic nights.

545
01:07:41,807 --> 01:07:44,809
Rym: And Thursdays are the catch-alls for various rants and tomfoolery.

546
01:07:45,330 --> 01:07:50,463
Scott: You can send us feedback by email to geeknights@frontroadcrew.com.

547
01:07:51,044 --> 01:07:53,330
Scott: Or you can send audio feedback via Odeo.

548
01:07:53,732 --> 01:07:56,910
Scott: Just click the link that says "send me an Odeo" on the right side of our website.

549
01:07:57,350 --> 01:08:02,433
Rym: If you like what you hear, you can catch the last 100 episodes in iTunes or in your favorite podcatcher.

550
01:08:02,674 --> 01:08:05,730
Rym: For the complete archives, visit the website, which has everything.

553
01:08:19,711 --> 01:08:23,189
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

554
01:08:23,670 --> 01:08:26,729
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
