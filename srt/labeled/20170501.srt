1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:13,632
Rym: It's Monday May 1st 2017.

2
00:00:13,632 --> 00:00:22,499
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight Drm because I guess we never did a show on this in the last 12 years.

3
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:25,620
Rym: I can't Can't find one in the database.

4
00:00:26,922 --> 00:00:27,937
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:29,242 --> 00:00:31,594
Rym: This is the second time in recent memory.

6
00:00:32,016 --> 00:00:34,231
Rym: one of us said hey Why don't we do a show on X?

7
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:35,240
Rym: and the other one said?

8
00:00:36,023 --> 00:00:42,386
Rym: We have definitely done a show on X and the first one agreed and then in searching the database There wasn't one.

9
00:00:42,446 --> 00:00:42,928
Rym: there has to be.

10
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:44,193
Rym: I can't find one.

11
00:00:44,494 --> 00:00:48,328
Rym: if you find a show we did Specifically about digital rights management.

12
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:50,917
Rym: My head is off to you and I will eat my hat.

13
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:52,389
Scott: Mm-hmm You know all your hats.

14
00:00:54,182 --> 00:00:55,108
Rym: I'm not eating all my heads.

15
00:00:55,148 --> 00:00:58,972
Scott: I will eat a hat which head Have a area.

16
00:00:59,941 --> 00:01:04,215
Scott: I'm sort of small your leather cowboy hat that you from the RIT days.

17
00:01:04,456 --> 00:01:05,420
Rym: Oh, yeah, that's good hat.

18
00:01:05,701 --> 00:01:06,222
Rym: I like that hat.

19
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:06,684
Scott: eat it.

20
00:01:07,105 --> 00:01:07,687
Scott: It's right edible.

21
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:08,410
Scott: It's leathery, right?

22
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:09,634
Rym: Yeah, you drive to boil it.

23
00:01:09,795 --> 00:01:11,220
Scott: Sure boiling is fine.

24
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,095
Rym: I'd probably better off eating that hat than eating the felt hat.

25
00:01:14,457 --> 00:01:15,060
Scott: That's I'm saying.

26
00:01:15,941 --> 00:01:24,579
Scott: Anyway, so remember the last time we did a Monday show I talked about my computer That was blue screen and how I replaced the motherboard and then it still was blue screen in.

27
00:01:24,639 --> 00:01:26,367
Scott: yeah I remember that and I was upset.

28
00:01:26,388 --> 00:01:28,840
Scott: I was like, oh, why did I waste my time updating the motherboard?

29
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:30,944
Scott: Wasn't actually the problem.

30
00:01:30,964 --> 00:01:33,672
Scott: Yeah, and I was like, oh well, you know, it could.

31
00:01:33,913 --> 00:01:34,936
Scott: what was it was this?

32
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:35,558
Scott: was it that?

33
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:37,961
Scott: so I Removed.

34
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:42,817
Scott: I had two SSDs in my computer the old one, which is the first SSD I ever bought.

35
00:01:42,917 --> 00:01:47,554
Scott: It's like maybe Four years old something like that four or five years old.

36
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:48,156
Scott: I don't know.

37
00:01:48,176 --> 00:01:50,983
Scott: it's old The old one.

38
00:01:51,003 --> 00:01:54,616
Scott: and then there's a newer one that I have that I bought more recently that's the Samsung one.

39
00:01:54,636 --> 00:01:55,740
Scott: that's better right now.

40
00:01:56,861 --> 00:02:01,012
Scott: So that old one is now relegated just being like the scratch drive.

41
00:02:01,032 --> 00:02:03,479
Rym: right that's what I've been doing with my old 32 gigabyte.

42
00:02:04,241 --> 00:02:06,873
Scott: So it's only used when I'm like using Adobe stuff.

43
00:02:06,954 --> 00:02:08,360
Scott: Otherwise, it's not being used at all.

44
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:13,040
Scott: It's just in there with no data being written to yep or from it whatsoever.

45
00:02:13,281 --> 00:02:18,880
Rym: So, you know I've noticed because I have a my giant like multi terabyte like many terabyte drive.

46
00:02:19,403 --> 00:02:22,379
Rym: I set it up to our only Adobe stuff and static media is on it.

47
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:27,760
Rym: So it literally if I ever like start an Adobe project I hear that drive spin up.

48
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,167
Scott: The point is this old SSD that was in there.

49
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:38,618
Scott: of the two SSDs I had I unplugged it because number one I hardly use it except when I'm Adobe ink so it doesn't matter if it's unplugged too much.

50
00:02:38,738 --> 00:02:42,253
Scott: and B Was it really the cause of blue screens?

51
00:02:42,293 --> 00:02:43,218
Scott: Well, I can tell you.

52
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,653
Scott: Since unplugging it two plus weeks ago.

53
00:02:46,674 --> 00:02:51,305
Rym: I have had Zero Blue screens.

54
00:02:51,506 --> 00:02:52,670
Rym: I would not have predicted that.

55
00:02:52,971 --> 00:02:55,180
Scott: Okay, this makes this is new to me, right?

56
00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:02,380
Scott: How can an SSD a drive a storage drive that is merely plugged into a computer that is not being used?

57
00:03:02,481 --> 00:03:04,077
Scott: No data written to or from it?

58
00:03:05,082 --> 00:03:12,000
Scott: How can that cause blue screens so frequently while the computer is doing other unrelated things not even accessing that drive?

59
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:17,949
Scott: that could make sense if say the SAT a controller on the board was busted.

60
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:24,000
Scott: that might cause blue screens, but we changed motherboards Yeah, and we were having blue screens on both of them.

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:32,480
Scott: It would make sense if the GPU is causing blue screens and these blue screens were having Various error messages of all shapes and sizes not one consistent error.

62
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:35,339
Rym: I got some guesses I think but it's all it wasn't.

63
00:03:35,781 --> 00:03:45,240
Scott: My RAM tests were always like a plus your RAM is totally good and my RAM was totally good You know, but I was just because RAM makes more sense for a blue screen.

64
00:03:45,503 --> 00:03:46,720
Rym: It was like the primary cause.

65
00:03:46,841 --> 00:03:50,140
Scott: Take would have made so much more sense for these random blue screens.

66
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,450
Rym: But so here's my guess cuz you gotta use its process of eliminations.

67
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:58,087
Scott: since that old bud busted SSD has been removed No blue screens.

68
00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:00,860
Scott: I should put it in someone's computer and see if it makes blue screens.

69
00:04:01,061 --> 00:04:10,656
Rym: So it's not data coming on or off of that drive obviously And it's probably not something like physical on the motherboard is one of the odds.

70
00:04:10,676 --> 00:04:12,200
Rym: you have two mother two motherboards are the same.

71
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:20,680
Rym: Right, so either that drive Way because even though you're not accessing it the SATA controller still like initializes it or whatever.

72
00:04:21,202 --> 00:04:24,636
Scott: Like I'm gonna crash just like rent sometimes for a long time.

73
00:04:24,676 --> 00:04:25,600
Scott: Sometimes a short time.

74
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:33,098
Rym: So maybe if it has a internal problem where occasionally it'll send spurious voltages up that SATA cable.

75
00:04:33,118 --> 00:04:38,754
Rym: I Could be that's already a pretty like esoteric impossible to troubleshoot.

76
00:04:38,774 --> 00:04:40,360
Scott: probably shouldn't it not cut like.

77
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,732
Scott: There should be some fault detection and protection.

78
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:58,060
Rym: it should be some protection in the motherboard Protection in the code to say hey don't crash in the half No But you can't put that everywhere because like putting voltage protection one can cause problems with bandwidth, especially like high-speed things uses.

79
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:05,680
Rym: Yeah old invention uses introduce latency and trouble depending on how they could say they're also big.

80
00:05:06,261 --> 00:05:18,412
Rym: Generally, you only protect like the power in places where you're likely to get weird power situations like from the power supply Yeah, but not from like a SATA cable plugged into a hard drive.

81
00:05:18,432 --> 00:05:21,400
Scott: Oh, it could have been also maybe on the power.

82
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:30,728
Rym: Yeah, the other thing would be it might have a problem where it over and under draws or just something weird causing the PSU to Have a momentary fault.

83
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,740
Rym: that then causes the system to get unstable.

84
00:05:33,922 --> 00:05:34,892
Rym: Those are both stretches.

85
00:05:34,953 --> 00:05:35,559
Rym: That's weird.

86
00:05:37,162 --> 00:05:37,443
Rym: We should.

87
00:05:37,524 --> 00:05:38,227
Rym: we should put you know what?

88
00:05:38,267 --> 00:05:39,534
Rym: I got a couple extra computers.

89
00:05:39,996 --> 00:05:40,680
Rym: Give me the drive.

90
00:05:41,223 --> 00:05:42,690
Rym: I'll just plug it into my HTTP.

91
00:05:42,851 --> 00:05:44,720
Rym: see out there and see if it blue screens.

92
00:05:45,042 --> 00:05:46,774
Scott: All right, just you got to keep running for a while.

93
00:05:46,794 --> 00:05:47,177
Scott: See you happen.

94
00:05:47,298 --> 00:05:47,540
Rym: Oh, yeah.

95
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:50,450
Scott: So cuz the thing is the drive never misbehaved.

96
00:05:50,531 --> 00:05:52,137
Scott: every time I wrote data to it it worked.

97
00:05:52,177 --> 00:05:53,080
Scott: every time I like that drive.

98
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,380
Rym: You had an RIT that had that one sector where you hear the you hear it like have a platter.

99
00:05:58,202 --> 00:05:58,866
Scott: It's an SSD.

100
00:05:58,886 --> 00:05:59,449
Scott: That can't happen.

101
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,858
Rym: Yeah, but that you had an old hard drive.

102
00:06:03,542 --> 00:06:04,589
Rym: Using this drive.

103
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:12,397
Scott: it appears to be a perfectly functioning 128 gigabyte SSD and it did not cause blue screens until you know, whenever.

104
00:06:12,417 --> 00:06:18,280
Rym: yeah Oh my god Linkiji in the chat had a hard a laptop hard drive that was like plug-and-play key.

105
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,950
Rym: Oh, you can unplug it an external one.

106
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:20,272
Rym: Mm-hmm.

107
00:06:20,433 --> 00:06:26,564
Rym: He would get a blue screen Reliably about an hour after he unplugged it Mm-hmm.

108
00:06:26,584 --> 00:06:31,160
Rym: So I don't know, you know, it's kind of an old motherboard in terms of like it's from an era.

109
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,280
Rym: Maybe SATA controllers are a little less for a bus back.

110
00:06:34,681 --> 00:06:36,367
Scott: Well, I mean I'm saying is this drive?

111
00:06:36,387 --> 00:06:40,260
Scott: this SSD is a Corsair brand SSD from way back.

112
00:06:40,882 --> 00:06:46,280
Scott: So I can't imagine this would be a problem for anyone buying new SSDs and you're only buying Samsung ones these days.

113
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,543
Scott: Right, so, you know our Intel ones which are fine But slower.

114
00:06:50,563 --> 00:06:53,737
Rym: because I had an SSD go through the traditional failure recently my old 2009 laptop.

115
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:58,961
Rym: I had to replace its you know, one SSD that I paid a lot of money for in 2009.

116
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:00,540
Scott: Yeah, that drive was not cheap when I bought it.

117
00:07:02,263 --> 00:07:08,520
Rym: Yeah, this old 32 gig SSD just like Windows like I go to play a video at a con and then Windows.

118
00:07:08,721 --> 00:07:10,871
Rym: It's just like some libraries are missing.

119
00:07:10,891 --> 00:07:12,076
Rym: So I'm like, okay, that's weird.

120
00:07:12,096 --> 00:07:12,679
Rym: I'll just use VLC.

121
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:18,134
Rym: I run VLC and the VLC complains about some DLL files having a problem.

122
00:07:18,756 --> 00:07:24,737
Rym: and a little bit more investigation I think half that file system had single bit errors like just littered throughout it.

123
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:28,206
Rym: scan disk Yeah, and scan disk crash.

124
00:07:28,567 --> 00:07:29,490
Rym: No, I tried it again.

125
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,577
Rym: scan disk crash and I gave up.

126
00:07:31,597 --> 00:07:33,461
Rym: and I just bought a new hard drive FSCK.

127
00:07:33,762 --> 00:07:36,770
Rym: yeah, and when I'm once I put the new hard drive in one.

128
00:07:37,292 --> 00:07:39,358
Rym: modern SSDs are way faster than old SSDs.

129
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,425
Rym: Yes, and to the laptop?

130
00:07:41,465 --> 00:07:42,348
Rym: is this SSD?

131
00:07:42,409 --> 00:07:44,637
Scott: even those old was still six gigabit per second.

132
00:07:44,778 --> 00:07:45,280
Scott: SSDs.

133
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,126
Rym: Yeah, you know but there.

134
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:49,023
Rym: but while they have six gigabit, you know They're they use that standard.

135
00:07:49,104 --> 00:07:56,867
Rym: old SSDs tend to actually have pretty low or pretty high latency Compared to what modern SSDs do like.

136
00:07:56,928 --> 00:07:59,135
Scott: I expect that SSD like, you know fail in the way.

137
00:07:59,155 --> 00:08:01,302
Scott: an SSD fails where it starts running Out of sectors.

138
00:08:01,342 --> 00:08:02,004
Rym: Yeah, and then you start.

139
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:08,520
Scott: I don't expect it to randomly blue-screen your computer with no indications that it was the SSDs fault In any of the error messages anywhere.

140
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:11,893
Rym: So what's interesting is in old computers like but like.

141
00:08:11,933 --> 00:08:17,070
Rym: I think the 486 was the end of this era Where like when I bought my first 46 my family about one.

142
00:08:17,411 --> 00:08:23,028
Rym: it came with a manual and the manual actually even went down to Voltages and pin outs and like motherboard diagrams.

143
00:08:23,309 --> 00:08:33,394
Scott: Yeah, that's a holdover because before then you'd be buying computers like, you know Coleco's not Coleco's Radio Shack Coco - or a Tandy something.

144
00:08:33,414 --> 00:08:37,390
Scott: or you know Even Apple Apple twos and Amigas.

145
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:38,514
Scott: they all came with those things.

146
00:08:38,594 --> 00:08:41,063
Scott: even the stereo that I bought It was like, you know, they.

147
00:08:41,164 --> 00:08:46,950
Scott: it was like a piece of furniture that had two giant speakers and a turntable and you know Dual cassette decks were dubbing or whatever.

148
00:08:47,392 --> 00:08:49,240
Scott: that came with a complete circuit diagram.

149
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,223
Scott: Yeah, it was a thing.

150
00:08:50,343 --> 00:09:01,200
Scott: all electronics that you also be able to throw a long up until like, you know early mid 90s Every time you bought some piece of electronics it came with like a complete circuit diagram.

151
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,324
Scott: It was just the thing.

152
00:09:02,726 --> 00:09:09,380
Rym: the physicality of what you were doing with electricity and older computers Was a lot simpler like when I was at RIT, this wasn't that long ago, right?

153
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:17,169
Rym: one of the early classes we took that was actually interesting was all about signal processing and We spent a lot of time learning about all the different networking standards.

154
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:27,339
Rym: and like buses like computer buses and the actual token ring physical electrical Signaling like here is the kind of wave like, you know differential Manchester or whatever.

155
00:09:28,461 --> 00:09:34,240
Rym: What is used in modern networking is so much more complicated than that stuff that all of that knowledge is literally worthless today.

156
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,294
Scott: But then I mean gigabit ethernet isn't just the same thing only fast.

157
00:09:37,354 --> 00:09:41,511
Rym: No, no, no, no, no, no No, so yeah, like Manchester encoding is pretty.

158
00:09:41,531 --> 00:09:43,498
Scott: that was that was from the 10 megabit days.

159
00:09:43,578 --> 00:09:49,407
Rym: Yeah Yeah, and we and actually like we're old enough at RIT Literally use 10 base - yeah.

160
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,094
Rym: and token ring.

161
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:52,420
Scott: so I didn't use token ring.

162
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,669
Scott: I used 10 and 100. but now we're using gigabit.

163
00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:00,882
Rym: Yeah You didn't use the 10 base - with the with the vampire clamps or no 10 bed the 10 base 5.

164
00:10:00,882 --> 00:10:02,460
Rym: There was the one with the thick coax cable.

165
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,633
Rym: You shove these vampire clamps in to make basically a ghetto hub now.

166
00:10:06,753 --> 00:10:08,438
Rym: and then the other one was the tees.

167
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:09,584
Rym: we get the tea Junctions the back.

168
00:10:09,624 --> 00:10:10,208
Rym: Yes, computer.

169
00:10:10,469 --> 00:10:16,280
Rym: That's 10 base - okay tees You're like twist it in and in and then you got to have a terminator on that last computer.

170
00:10:16,525 --> 00:10:19,205
Rym: I've seen those Yeah stuff's all obsolete.

171
00:10:19,225 --> 00:10:31,644
Rym: But my point is that back then in those classes I took we could literally plug oscilloscopes or other devices into network cables and by looking at waveforms and using like voltimeters Troubleshoot problems.

172
00:10:32,427 --> 00:10:36,398
Rym: I don't think it's feasible to do that kind of troubleshooting on modern computers.

173
00:10:36,438 --> 00:10:42,179
Rym: too much data Yeah and the kind of equipment you would need that would be sensitive enough is probably out of the realm.

174
00:10:42,219 --> 00:10:48,444
Rym: like Flukes are not even cheap and modern flukes are probably way more expensive even Good times.

175
00:10:48,766 --> 00:10:51,056
Rym: So, uh, I was this weekend at Zenkai con.

176
00:10:51,116 --> 00:10:51,920
Rym: I did three panels.

177
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,750
Rym: So if any of you are here because you saw those panels a lot of people were really, you know That's not an audience that typically sees our stuff.

178
00:10:59,212 --> 00:11:14,860
Rym: most of the people in these mostly full rooms No idea who I was and only one person walked out and I think they had to go to the bathroom based on their body Language, so it was a good time, but I got to tell you Zenkai con is great and I have a lot of fun there.

179
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,688
Rym: independent of that Lancaster got a Lancaster.

180
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,855
Scott: That's why I don't go there.

181
00:11:22,296 --> 00:11:30,470
Rym: It is the only city I have been to in my entire life where a City, it's just technically a city village.

182
00:11:30,751 --> 00:11:38,458
Rym: people on the street townies will come up to strangers and have adversarial interactions with them.

183
00:11:38,478 --> 00:11:41,130
Rym: and But they are not actually panhandling.

184
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,060
Rym: They're just being aggressive over nothing.

185
00:11:44,081 --> 00:11:52,687
Rym: I had people just like bothering us and like like random people will come up to you and just say Unintelligible things to you regularly, but none of them are panhandling.

186
00:11:52,707 --> 00:11:56,980
Rym: They're just townies living there accosting strangers who came to town.

187
00:11:57,242 --> 00:12:02,730
Scott: They say uh, she's just walking down the street and someone comes He'll walk up to you and a lot of them would.

188
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:09,616
Rym: some of them were just asked like what's going on with the freak show What's up with all the costume weirdos, but some of them would just say gibberish like.

189
00:12:09,676 --> 00:12:11,042
Rym: I did not understand What.

190
00:12:11,062 --> 00:12:11,625
Rym: a lot of them is.

191
00:12:11,645 --> 00:12:15,165
Scott: not just crazy, Pennsylvania sticks accent But you know what?

192
00:12:15,205 --> 00:12:17,374
Rym: It might be my guess not not to be.

193
00:12:17,394 --> 00:12:18,660
Scott: Hey, can I get a glass of water?

194
00:12:20,842 --> 00:12:26,782
Rym: If I had to guess to paraphrase someone else who was in our group the spice must flow Mm-hmm.

195
00:12:26,943 --> 00:12:30,340
Rym: So I suspect it might have been some spice and or met that was going on.

196
00:12:31,522 --> 00:12:33,814
Scott: That is a problem in much of this country.

197
00:12:34,115 --> 00:12:39,880
Scott: a lot of the people who are People keep talking about how this meth is a problem and I don't want to talk too long about this cuz Monday.

198
00:12:40,061 --> 00:12:42,148
Scott: Yeah, let me just say isn't that a problem that solves itself.

199
00:12:42,609 --> 00:12:42,870
Rym: Really?

200
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,095
Rym: Yeah.

201
00:12:44,115 --> 00:12:44,797
Rym: No because it doesn't.

202
00:12:44,817 --> 00:12:52,096
Rym: so It takes too long to have that super dark timeline outcome that you're alluding to.

203
00:12:52,337 --> 00:12:53,540
Scott: Oh, maybe I should get it on this.

204
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:55,748
Scott: I Get a long time before.

205
00:12:58,401 --> 00:13:02,620
Rym: Also, like meth is just an amphetamine and amphetamines have their own problems.

206
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:10,608
Rym: There's a separate problem of you know, unclean meth made in bathtubs or whatever, but I mean we had that problem with cheese, too Yeah, but in general should I avoid cheese?

207
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:20,220
Rym: in general stimulants like that have a lot of Positive by some definitions effects and a lot of negative by all definitions effects.

208
00:13:21,261 --> 00:13:29,580
Rym: So like, you know during World War two like both us and the Germans and a lot of the armies Just gave meth to soldiers like all the time if he made a YouTube video of doing meth.

209
00:13:30,441 --> 00:13:31,163
Scott: Was that not allowed?

210
00:13:31,183 --> 00:13:32,567
Scott: I do.

211
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:37,040
Scott: I do not want to try crystal meth, but you were the one who was gonna try it.

212
00:13:38,126 --> 00:13:39,433
Scott: I don't even drink alcohol.

213
00:13:39,453 --> 00:13:40,479
Scott: You're the one who has to do the best.

214
00:13:44,762 --> 00:13:51,580
Rym: But to otherwise the con was great but there was a moment on Friday night It was like midnight and we we went to have some drinks for hanging out.

215
00:13:51,941 --> 00:13:56,800
Rym: So all of us are walking back to our hotel, which is like we're just like north of the train station.

216
00:13:57,442 --> 00:14:03,040
Rym: So we're walking through town and we see these two guys and they see us and they all hey and start running at us.

217
00:14:03,942 --> 00:14:18,120
Rym: so we brace for impact and then they pull up and they're just like the most stereotypical like live-in Philly dudes and The discourse we had with them boiled down to yo you look like you from around here.

218
00:14:18,381 --> 00:14:22,240
Rym: Where the fuck can a man get some food in this country ass town?

219
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,391
Scott: Mm-hmm, and I were they in that country ass town.

220
00:14:25,471 --> 00:14:26,555
Rym: It was their first zenk icon.

221
00:14:26,636 --> 00:14:27,680
Scott: Why were they in zenk icon?

222
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:28,867
Rym: Cause zenk icon is pretty fun.

223
00:14:28,887 --> 00:14:30,360
Rym: I don't know why you're so down on zenk icon.

224
00:14:30,561 --> 00:14:36,438
Rym: I played more tabletop games with quality people at this zenk icon than I did at the last Pac South.

225
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,703
Rym: Sure We just did nothing but play Pac South.

226
00:14:40,724 --> 00:14:41,687
Scott: you got other shit to do.

227
00:14:41,927 --> 00:14:42,288
Scott: Like what?

228
00:14:42,329 --> 00:14:45,940
Rym: What did you do at Pac South other than play tabletop games?

229
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:49,570
Rym: We were other than running your panel, which I also did.

230
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:54,687
Scott: Ate food, walked around an expo hall Played some games that weren't tabletop games.

231
00:14:54,767 --> 00:14:55,229
Rym: Like what?

232
00:14:55,269 --> 00:15:01,604
Scott: Name one Forget the name.

233
00:15:01,624 --> 00:15:03,430
Rym: Yeah that game.

234
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:04,173
Rym: I remember that game.

235
00:15:04,233 --> 00:15:04,996
Rym: That game was pretty good.

236
00:15:05,076 --> 00:15:05,317
Scott: Yeah.

237
00:15:05,578 --> 00:15:06,220
Scott: It was a good game.

238
00:15:08,722 --> 00:15:09,828
Rym: I'll come back to zenk icon next year.

239
00:15:09,869 --> 00:15:11,438
Scott: Oh I remember watching that hearthstone tournament.

240
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:19,712
Rym: Also Apparently now that Pacs has negotiated to be in the Philly Convention Center I learned from a couple people because I didn't know a lot about that convention center.

241
00:15:19,732 --> 00:15:20,254
Scott: You went there.

242
00:15:20,274 --> 00:15:21,900
Scott: Yeah, but I don't know a lot about it.

243
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:30,940
Rym: Like I know a lot about the BCEC and the BCC and the Hines just cuz like, you know For various research I never knew shit about the Philly Convention Center.

244
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:35,239
Rym: But apparently the reason building you've been in yeah, but I why would I have studied it?

245
00:15:35,521 --> 00:15:36,026
Scott: I'm just saying.

246
00:15:36,046 --> 00:15:37,157
Rym: You wanna run a convention there?

247
00:15:37,238 --> 00:15:37,339
Scott: No.

248
00:15:38,022 --> 00:15:42,374
Rym: So apparently the reason no one ran conventions there was that the unions would basically just say no.

249
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:48,220
Rym: like that that convention center was notorious For having the worst possible union interactions you could have.

250
00:15:48,722 --> 00:16:00,040
Rym: Apparently you had to negotiate with five separate unions who all had Required hours and overtime and everything to do anything in that convention center, and that's why nothing is really there.

251
00:16:00,843 --> 00:16:24,240
Rym: so apparently they consolidated that and now you only have to negotiate with one union and Some people have implied to me that it might have been because Pacs sort of like came in with money and said listen guys it's not really clear what happened, but Might maybe some guy could move into that convention center Being downtown grow because they were already outgrowing the shockingly big Convention Center in Lancaster.

252
00:16:25,044 --> 00:16:28,140
Rym: Like since you've been a few years I make it bigger.

253
00:16:28,763 --> 00:16:32,360
Scott: It is it is way big just a Marriott Hotel when I was there.

254
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:35,274
Rym: No, it's in a full-on convention center like a pretty big one.

255
00:16:35,535 --> 00:16:40,760
Rym: Oh when I was there I mean it's connected to the Marriott the Marriott, but it has a whole bunch of big spaces.

256
00:16:40,881 --> 00:16:42,006
Rym: It's just completely full.

257
00:16:42,489 --> 00:16:45,467
Rym: every hotel in the whole city was full and in fact That's not a lot of hotel.

258
00:16:45,527 --> 00:16:53,060
Rym: when we got to our days in There was a line of people waiting to check in and they were all having drama and trouble.

259
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,179
Scott: I'm blazing at the daisies.

260
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:58,615
Rym: It looks like most of them were at the wrong days in because they were kids.

261
00:16:58,655 --> 00:17:12,260
Rym: they didn't know how to make hotel reservations And the rest of them were trying to get a hotel in town because they drove to town Not just expecting they could get a hotel room and literally every hotel in the entire city was sold out and they were getting desperate.

262
00:17:12,902 --> 00:17:15,608
Rym: So later that night our hotel put up a no vacanee sign.

263
00:17:15,628 --> 00:17:16,330
Rym: Mm-hmm.

264
00:17:16,551 --> 00:17:17,253
Rym: It was spelled wrong.

265
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:18,396
Rym: So no vacanee.

266
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:21,890
Rym: Yeah That hotel was the third worst hotel.

267
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:26,377
Rym: I've ever slept at in my life, by the way Do not ever is worse than the Chai live motor in.

268
00:17:26,539 --> 00:17:27,843
Rym: no Is the third word.

269
00:17:27,903 --> 00:17:34,440
Rym: the Chai motor in is the second worst and the family and I stayed at like 80 miles outside of Gatlinburg.

270
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:38,168
Rym: Tennessee is probably the worst Child.

271
00:17:38,189 --> 00:17:40,045
Scott: that motor in The family in the door did not lock the child.

272
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:48,540
Rym: I might be the worst as we pushed a couch up to the door to lock the door.

273
00:17:48,741 --> 00:17:53,800
Scott: You can always go stay in one of the like nightmare cockroach bedbug places in Times Square area for one night.

274
00:17:54,784 --> 00:17:55,869
Scott: You just walk over and stay there.

275
00:17:56,391 --> 00:17:59,002
Rym: Yeah, it's only like a hundred bucks a night - yeah There was.

276
00:17:59,022 --> 00:18:03,635
Rym: so you want to read what might be the whitest article anyone's ever written on the internet.

277
00:18:03,895 --> 00:18:14,457
Rym: this like white tech bro Dude blogger wrote a whole article about his adventure booking a room in that hotel and spending the night and how horrifying it was.

278
00:18:14,557 --> 00:18:17,525
Rym: and it is just the Dumbest article you will ever read.

279
00:18:17,545 --> 00:18:20,232
Rym: Hmm, but yeah, it's Monday.

280
00:18:20,253 --> 00:18:21,476
Rym: It's May.

281
00:18:21,516 --> 00:18:22,499
Rym: It's May day, too.

282
00:18:22,579 --> 00:18:26,397
Rym: So Happy eight-hour days workers rights and such.

283
00:18:26,879 --> 00:18:31,235
Rym: but Amazon you also have Labor Day.

284
00:18:31,315 --> 00:18:35,146
Scott: why we need two days Day is fucking five days a week.

285
00:18:35,788 --> 00:18:37,954
Rym: May day covers a lot of things though.

286
00:18:38,315 --> 00:18:42,086
Rym: Yeah, but it's the first Early May.

287
00:18:42,146 --> 00:18:45,156
Rym: all the fun things between now and May 5th is all the fun.

288
00:18:45,176 --> 00:18:46,360
Scott: biz, you know, what starts today?

289
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,159
Rym: Gatlinburg family in has some a-plus meth.

290
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,146
Rym: You get enough people in that chat.

291
00:18:55,849 --> 00:18:59,540
Rym: so anyway in actual tech news, we wasted like 20 minutes talking about this.

292
00:19:00,521 --> 00:19:09,979
Rym: Amazon announced a service that's actually pretty Important I think to the ecosystem of the internet because it's hard to do this if you don't pay someone to do it for you.

293
00:19:10,502 --> 00:19:21,300
Rym: but basically Amazon launched something called a self-service marketplace for subscription providers and it's basically Subscribe with anima at Amazon.

294
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:37,255
Rym: so if you sell a thing that is a technology subscription like Adobe Creative Cloud would be an example or Access to a website that does a thing or an app or a game or anything like that Then you can sell that just in Amazon store, right?

295
00:19:37,335 --> 00:19:38,460
Rym: They'll just handle it for you.

296
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,385
Scott: This is a thing where anyone there's.

297
00:19:40,405 --> 00:19:48,920
Scott: a lot of people have this business model now of subscription selling right subscribe to Netflix Subscribe to a box of stuff that comes in the mail every month.

298
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:55,192
Scott: Right a lot of people are using the subscribe business model But everyone who does it has to implement it on.

299
00:19:55,232 --> 00:19:57,760
Scott: that's like code the same code over and over again.

300
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:02,471
Scott: So it's like that's if you want to do a subscription thing You have to write this code that everyone's already written.

301
00:20:02,491 --> 00:20:04,320
Scott: There's no way you there's no service.

302
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,545
Scott: It just like offers it to.

303
00:20:05,565 --> 00:20:09,260
Rym: you know, all the code really has to do now is interface with payment processors.

304
00:20:09,481 --> 00:20:17,699
Rym: yeah, take customer info and Somehow provide an authentication token of some kind to the actual service.

305
00:20:17,859 --> 00:20:22,432
Scott: Yep So now Amazon made a thing so you don't have to write this code anymore You can just use their thing

306
00:20:22,534 --> 00:20:30,140
Rym: and more importantly It means that your thing is just in Amazon's marketplace Like if there wasn't patreon and GeekNights was for money, which don't worry that will never happen.

307
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:46,497
Rym: You could literally we could be like by GeekNights for a dollar a month on Amazon And like I was looking at the docks now it works and I think this is going to Actually hurt some of the services like patreon that many people are using to do this kind of thing.

308
00:20:46,939 --> 00:20:48,744
Scott: if those It's not it's.

309
00:20:48,845 --> 00:20:51,400
Scott: yeah, it's not accessible to pay trans for individual.

310
00:20:51,421 --> 00:20:52,564
Rym: Yeah This is this is.

311
00:20:52,664 --> 00:20:58,161
Rym: this is well in terms of what you need to be able to bring to the table You have to be a step up in that You're.

312
00:20:58,222 --> 00:21:12,933
Rym: you probably need to be a company and more importantly you need to have the development Expertise to be able to use the service because it's gonna let you set up that Authentication token like you still need to make that all happen Easier than developing.

313
00:21:13,297 --> 00:21:23,862
Rym: Yeah So I think there will be a you know would be a good place for this Certain video games that are on patreon right now to give you access to the video game Like.

314
00:21:23,902 --> 00:21:24,424
Rym: that is the.

315
00:21:24,504 --> 00:21:25,688
Rym: that is the use case here.

316
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:31,125
Rym: the question what I don't know is how much of a big Amazon's taking Compared to other services.

317
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:32,791
Rym: I didn't dig into that much detail.

318
00:21:32,811 --> 00:21:33,494
Scott: They always take.

319
00:21:33,714 --> 00:21:36,655
Rym: yeah, of course they take but Take and take and take.

320
00:21:37,784 --> 00:21:38,769
Rym: pay attention to this

321
00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:39,453
Scott: rent seeking

322
00:21:39,976 --> 00:21:58,054
Rym: because if This ecosystem I suspect is going to be the primary subscription ecosystem in a relatively short amount of time Because the reality is people trust Amazon and even though there are other e-commerce platforms Lay people do not trust them because they aren't Amazon and that's just the way.

323
00:21:58,094 --> 00:22:01,739
Rym: it is real hard to compete with Amazon Like seamless in Grubhub.

324
00:22:02,202 --> 00:22:08,040
Rym: There's a reason it's so hard to compete with them because even though they don't offer the best services They already exist and people have heard of them.

325
00:22:10,521 --> 00:22:12,247
Rym: Anyway and some other tech news.

326
00:22:12,588 --> 00:22:16,120
Rym: that's actually a big deal and is gonna be a bigger deal later.

327
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,757
Rym: So I'm not gonna talk about in too much depth, but tinder that website to get your fucking on.

328
00:22:20,977 --> 00:22:22,647
Scott: Yeah I'm not even a website.

329
00:22:22,667 --> 00:22:23,634
Scott: I'm pretty sure is just an app.

330
00:22:23,695 --> 00:22:24,360
Rym: Is it just an app?

331
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,951
Scott: I don't think you can swipe on the web.

332
00:22:25,971 --> 00:22:26,898
Scott: I think you can only swipe.

333
00:22:26,918 --> 00:22:30,879
Rym: well I saw someone made an app that will auto swipe through their API.

334
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:38,264
Rym: Alright, so but essentially another company Used some sort of.

335
00:22:38,304 --> 00:22:43,499
Rym: they use their API to get all the photos that people have uploaded into tinder.

336
00:22:43,983 --> 00:22:45,077
Rym: But you can just pull out of the API.

337
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:51,020
Rym: I mean stuff's just public essentially and they used it to make a data set for facial recognition.

338
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:54,536
Scott: Yeah, I mean someone put out free photos that are all squares.

339
00:22:54,556 --> 00:22:54,978
Scott: They're all.

340
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:57,667
Scott: you know, it's Thanks, you can read the.

341
00:22:57,787 --> 00:22:59,073
Scott: I know they're all people's faces.

342
00:22:59,234 --> 00:23:01,363
Scott: cuz I don't want to go in too much depth It's on one hand.

343
00:23:01,403 --> 00:23:09,490
Rym: on your own data sets are one of the like like the last frontiers of Monetizing and late capitalism in terms of technology.

344
00:23:09,551 --> 00:23:21,487
Rym: right now like on Wall Street pretty much everywhere Selling data or being a platform are like the places you can still make money without having to do something Like that no one's ever done before.

345
00:23:21,668 --> 00:23:38,240
Rym: like there's a lot of money in making data sets using data sets and a data set like this for like generating machine learning algorithms or doing anything with facial recognition super super super valuable and useful and Arguably violates the terms of service of the website.

346
00:23:38,321 --> 00:23:44,759
Rym: The data was gotten from yeah And the whole cat of worms that gets opened is say there's a website that has information on it.

347
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:49,195
Rym: Copyright means I can't take that information and just redistribute it without a license.

348
00:23:49,496 --> 00:23:50,219
Rym: That's already covered.

349
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:54,100
Rym: But what if I take that information and use it myself?

350
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,489
Rym: But don't provide that information to other people.

351
00:23:56,529 --> 00:23:59,300
Rym: I just provide information I generated from that information.

352
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:02,794
Scott: I mean the only reason we know they scrape tinder is because someone said so.

353
00:24:02,814 --> 00:24:06,239
Scott: if they're just kept their mouth shut it would just Been like hey, we have a facial recognition thing.

354
00:24:06,982 --> 00:24:08,438
Scott: No one would have known where the hell they got it from.

355
00:24:08,964 --> 00:24:10,499
Scott: It's only because they open their big fat mouth.

356
00:24:10,902 --> 00:24:17,294
Scott: And this is the same thing I say to a lot of other people is like a lot of you will make stuff and they upload It to YouTube and it gets taken down or like yep people.

357
00:24:17,354 --> 00:24:22,074
Rym: the dude who made it steward Kolyani released it under a public domain creative right.

358
00:24:22,114 --> 00:24:23,519
Scott: a lot of people will like make.

359
00:24:24,182 --> 00:24:25,930
Scott: it was like a 3d chrono trigger.

360
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:31,436
Scott: people are making some other who making a Super Metro a Metroid 2 remake and these things get taken down.

361
00:24:31,476 --> 00:24:44,891
Scott: and it's like assholes When you make something and you're gonna put it out there And there's something about it that is gonna stop it somehow because you got your data from somewhere shady Yeah, or you're violating some copyright something while you're generating buzz.

362
00:24:45,052 --> 00:24:45,433
Rym: call it.

363
00:24:45,894 --> 00:24:47,840
Rym: call it Trono Bringer or something.

364
00:24:47,961 --> 00:24:50,059
Scott: Don't take any fucking credit for it.

365
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:59,699
Scott: So no one knows who the hell you are and just put it up on BitTorrent completely anonymously And don't say where it came from and no one will be able to fucking stop you.

366
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:02,288
Scott: I scraped tinder to make some database.

367
00:25:02,408 --> 00:25:07,027
Scott: I would just put it anonymously on to BitTorrent like tada Mysteriously.

368
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:08,640
Scott: this database appeared out of nowhere.

369
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,850
Scott: I don't know where it came from and now everyone has it.

370
00:25:11,111 --> 00:25:14,038
Scott: if you do it where you tell everyone now There's gonna be a big ruckus.

371
00:25:14,381 --> 00:25:15,447
Rym: But it's not only that this.

372
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:28,674
Rym: the reason this could like I don't want to talk about this too much Is that there are so many interesting issues you could talk about based on this one story like for example right now I'm looking at information in a web browser because that information is publicly available on the internet.

373
00:25:29,355 --> 00:25:37,990
Rym: if a website has terms of service For use but does not have accounts and does not block people from accessing it Are you actually bound to those terms of service?

374
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:40,519
Scott: especially does have accounts though, but say you don't.

375
00:25:41,021 --> 00:25:51,720
Rym: Especially if you hit a website with a browser Meaning, you know some sort of scraper curl that doesn't actually read the footer of the page that says it has terms of service.

376
00:25:52,225 --> 00:26:01,522
Rym: You'd never even encountered them If I trespass on some land and I didn't actually pass any no trespassing signs at any point because they didn't put them on That side of the property though.

377
00:26:01,563 --> 00:26:15,019
Rym: all those questions are largely unanswerable even my lawyers right now and they've been unanswerable for a long time and Based on the way Congress is going I suspect no laws will be passed in the next 10 or 20 years to deal with this stuff.

378
00:26:15,814 --> 00:26:22,220
Rym: so The upside is if you use tinder your photo is part of this public domain data set of people.

379
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:37,940
Scott: I mean we always say this anyway anything that you upload to the internet Anything that you put on a device any data you put on any sort of electronic thing that is connected to the internet Even if you check private only share with my friends direct message only.

380
00:26:38,522 --> 00:26:39,365
Scott: It doesn't matter.

381
00:26:39,445 --> 00:26:45,365
Scott: you have effectively, you know shared that thing with the entire Human race.

382
00:26:45,385 --> 00:26:52,107
Rym: let's put it simply there are no sharing controls Except client-side encryption.

383
00:26:52,608 --> 00:26:55,055
Rym: That is the only way you can control data you send.

384
00:26:55,075 --> 00:26:57,748
Scott: and even then if I send something to rimming I know you don't.

385
00:26:57,768 --> 00:26:58,519
Rym: you can't trust me.

386
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,955
Scott: I have to trust Rym not to share it with the entire world on purpose or by accident.

387
00:27:04,641 --> 00:27:07,251
Scott: You know now that image is unencrypted on rims phone.

388
00:27:07,713 --> 00:27:09,480
Scott: who knows where it's gonna go next, right?

389
00:27:10,081 --> 00:27:20,536
Scott: Oh, the only way if I take say a photo and I want it to be absolutely private I must a keep it in my house only on non internet connected mediums, and that is it.

390
00:27:21,318 --> 00:27:25,728
Rym: and the last news Surprisingly multiple people I guess goble goble.

391
00:27:25,909 --> 00:27:28,317
Rym: Yeah, everyone knows that I used to spend a lot of time in Turkey.

392
00:27:28,337 --> 00:27:33,396
Rym: So Because that's not a super common thing to do I guess so a lot of.

393
00:27:33,416 --> 00:27:34,199
Scott: I don't think it's the.

394
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:45,700
Rym: oh Even before it was not the most visited country three different people messaged me to tell me about this or you know As it happened ad zenk icon two different people when I ran into them because I didn't see in a while.

395
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:51,171
Rym: They're like, oh, yeah, you hear about Turkey and I was like, it's good I heard about it a lot of things are going on with Turkey.

396
00:27:51,251 --> 00:27:53,260
Rym: one thing in particular like oh how they blocked Wikipedia.

397
00:27:53,361 --> 00:27:55,131
Rym: So yes to all of you out there.

398
00:27:55,251 --> 00:28:01,859
Rym: I'm aware that this happened and the irony I mean the fact that Wikipedia is blocked in Turkey.

399
00:28:01,879 --> 00:28:06,060
Rym: I. Well, I don't want to say it's not news because it is news and it's a bad thing.

400
00:28:06,481 --> 00:28:10,920
Rym: But it is probably the least bad news that has come out of Turkey in the last several weeks.

401
00:28:11,261 --> 00:28:14,314
Scott: It's a bad news, but of the bad news is it is the least one.

402
00:28:14,354 --> 00:28:23,435
Rym: I mean if you're not familiar Turkey basically voted in a scam election to Make er to on effectively the Chancellor of Germany.

403
00:28:23,455 --> 00:28:25,686
Scott: Oh Is that how you pronounce his name?

404
00:28:26,349 --> 00:28:27,355
Scott: I thought it was edrogan.

405
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:33,877
Rym: It's Turkish is interesting in that if the letters like pronunciation and conjugation are 100% regular.

406
00:28:35,502 --> 00:28:39,338
Rym: See now you look at when you learn like Spanish or French like they teach you rules for conjugation.

407
00:28:39,358 --> 00:28:45,695
Scott: I thought My pronunciation was way more Marduk guard a calm than yours was.

408
00:28:46,096 --> 00:28:47,660
Rym: Yeah the way that now I'm disappointed.

409
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,673
Scott: Hey, he's like, I mean he's already not cool.

410
00:28:49,733 --> 00:28:50,700
Scott: But now he's even less cool.

411
00:28:50,901 --> 00:28:52,291
Scott: So you want to learn how to be evil.

412
00:28:52,371 --> 00:28:53,620
Scott: at least be cool evil.

413
00:28:53,701 --> 00:28:55,019
Rym: Here's how you pronounce Turkish words.

414
00:28:55,303 --> 00:29:04,447
Rym: You look up a few rules But basically learn how to pronounce all the vowels and look up the list of consonants that are pronounced and any Consonant that's not on that list.

415
00:29:04,649 --> 00:29:10,979
Rym: Just kind of swallow it as you say the word So like yeah to him just kind of like swallow the end and you'll sound close enough.

416
00:29:12,261 --> 00:29:25,742
Scott: Anyway, so anyway, so funniest thing is that they blocked Wikipedia and perhaps one of the reasons they blocked Wikipedia Is there pages like this which are 2017 block of Wikipedia in Turkey is literally on Wikipedia.

417
00:29:25,782 --> 00:29:29,496
Scott: there's a Wikipedia page about it Wikipedia being blocked in Turkey.

418
00:29:29,516 --> 00:29:33,773
Scott: and I was saying like hey You know, I guess it's not as bad as the Great Firewall of China.

419
00:29:33,793 --> 00:29:35,640
Scott: I'm pretty sure they don't allow Wikipedia either.

420
00:29:35,861 --> 00:29:37,109
Rym: Well, they're making their own Wikipedia.

421
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:37,431
Rym: Sure.

422
00:29:37,451 --> 00:29:38,759
Scott: That's gonna work out great for them.

423
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:46,400
Scott: But like if I don't have Wikipedia, that's like I could survive but that's pretty close to not having water.

424
00:29:46,681 --> 00:29:48,934
Scott: It's real bad without Wikipedia.

425
00:29:49,014 --> 00:29:50,040
Scott: Like I don't know anything.

426
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,911
Rym: So yeah with what do I know if I have the internet and Wikipedia?

427
00:29:54,252 --> 00:29:56,198
Rym: I can know basic stuff about everything.

428
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:58,345
Rym: if I have the Internet but not Wikipedia.

429
00:29:58,686 --> 00:30:01,696
Rym: How is baby formed is the best you're gonna get about most topics.

430
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:02,820
Scott: What the fuck - I don't know shit.

431
00:30:03,222 --> 00:30:04,025
Rym: Like we really are.

432
00:30:04,045 --> 00:30:05,491
Rym: we're like, why don't we do a show about crabs?

433
00:30:05,812 --> 00:30:10,347
Rym: and I realized that without Wikipedia I don't know fucking anything about crabs.

434
00:30:10,407 --> 00:30:16,800
Scott: and I my first my first thought was actually a stupid thought which is oh go to the Library and get like a tiny book about crabs.

435
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,060
Scott: That's like one of those, you know ones meant for kids or something.

436
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:23,520
Scott: But like, you know the kind you would do a book report with so you'd actually get more information about crabs.

437
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,605
Rym: That's what you'd have to do.

438
00:30:24,786 --> 00:30:25,891
Scott: But then I was like, wait a minute.

439
00:30:26,152 --> 00:30:28,000
Scott: I can just read the Wikipedia page about crabs.

440
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:32,553
Scott: No everything there is no yeah without Wikipedia.

441
00:30:32,573 --> 00:30:34,320
Rym: I don't know stuff anymore.

442
00:30:34,521 --> 00:30:39,520
Scott: I see, you know used to be the every year during the holiday times Wikipedia post that thing on all the pages.

443
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,371
Scott: Like give us money.

444
00:30:40,432 --> 00:30:42,988
Scott: Oh my gosh I give the money now and I guess about.

445
00:30:43,349 --> 00:30:46,100
Scott: I guess enough people give the money to keep them alive because they're still there.

446
00:30:46,703 --> 00:30:48,676
Scott: I switched to give it the monthly monies.

447
00:30:49,099 --> 00:30:51,387
Scott: Oh Obviously less monthly money, right?

448
00:30:51,427 --> 00:30:55,440
Scott: But maybe you're paying for the whole thing maybe but it's like, you know that way.

449
00:30:55,741 --> 00:30:56,003
Scott: It's like.

450
00:30:56,043 --> 00:31:00,646
Scott: I don't have to remember to do it, you know at the end of the year Like did I do it already this year?

451
00:31:00,706 --> 00:31:01,148
Scott: I don't remember.

452
00:31:01,168 --> 00:31:02,232
Scott: It's nope monthly monies.

453
00:31:02,252 --> 00:31:03,857
Scott: It's either Wikipedia going.

454
00:31:03,978 --> 00:31:04,620
Rym: it's just interesting.

455
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,566
Rym: I'm curious out there.

456
00:31:05,586 --> 00:31:07,839
Rym: This is like a food for thought for you guys out there the listener.

457
00:31:08,921 --> 00:31:15,080
Rym: How often do you actually go to Wikipedia and do you think about using a percentage of your Google searches result with success on?

458
00:31:15,464 --> 00:31:16,318
Scott: Wikipedia page.

459
00:31:16,733 --> 00:31:18,306
Scott: Yeah and that's where you got what you want.

460
00:31:18,326 --> 00:31:31,840
Rym: because the way my life goes is any time I'm in any Conversation and someone brings something up and I don't know enough about that thing to engage with them that day I just read the Wikipedia page about whatever that thing is.

461
00:31:33,102 --> 00:31:43,400
Scott: I think about half of my Google searches are wiki space something so that I know that I'm gonna basically saying give me the Wikipedia page for this Google because the next answer is gonna be some Yahoo answers bullshit.

462
00:31:43,581 --> 00:31:45,637
Rym: And then after that, it's down into Urban Dictionary.

463
00:31:45,758 --> 00:31:48,630
Scott: Yep Sometimes Urban Dictionary is what you want.

464
00:31:48,911 --> 00:31:50,419
Scott: Yeah, like what the hell does this mean?

465
00:31:56,571 --> 00:32:01,645
Rym: But anyway things of the day I just stumbled upon this YouTube show randomly.

466
00:32:02,186 --> 00:32:08,644
Rym: it's old it's from like 2007 and I can't believe I haven't found this like.

467
00:32:08,664 --> 00:32:12,159
Rym: I never ran into this before Because it's just it's up my alley.

468
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:15,030
Scott: in a lot of ways this matches up with one of our things.

469
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:18,370
Scott: It's like, you know, sometimes you have a thing with your group of people like an inside joke.

470
00:32:18,711 --> 00:32:24,250
Scott: Oh, you know some story that's told off in or you know, like a like, you know, the certain things.

471
00:32:24,391 --> 00:32:27,275
Scott: There's things you have, you know I don't know what to call them but like.

472
00:32:27,597 --> 00:32:37,350
Scott: and then you discover another separate group of people local me Right and they have the same or similar thing to what you have and somehow you had this connection with these other people.

473
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:41,610
Rym: Yeah, I didn't even know like you both make the same kind of joke about a specific kind of board game.

474
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:47,730
Rym: So, uh, this is a show you can watch called cautionary tales of swords.

475
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:49,679
Rym: This is episode one.

476
00:32:50,241 --> 00:32:56,590
Rym: quote in this episode, honey I killed our son and swords will cut your fucking hands off.

477
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:57,172
Scott: that's true.

478
00:32:57,533 --> 00:33:08,102
Rym: all the show is is a dude with an eyepatch answering viewer mail about swords and Cautionary skits explaining why don't ever own swords?

479
00:33:08,483 --> 00:33:09,325
Rym: swords are stupid.

480
00:33:09,606 --> 00:33:10,790
Rym: They will fucking cut you.

481
00:33:11,492 --> 00:33:12,535
Rym: Never own swords.

482
00:33:12,997 --> 00:33:17,050
Scott: Yeah, and there are many episodes when you're in the kitchen with a knife like you're cautious like you.

483
00:33:17,452 --> 00:33:18,377
Scott: This is dangerous.

484
00:33:18,417 --> 00:33:20,710
Scott: I must respect this blade and not cut myself.

485
00:33:21,612 --> 00:33:29,214
Scott: Like people don't hold swords that often and even nerds the olds who hold swords more often than normal people But still not that often.

486
00:33:29,234 --> 00:33:34,148
Scott: a sword is a fucking giant ass knife, especially like a Japanese one.

487
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:37,430
Scott: Holy shit It is so dangerous.

488
00:33:38,193 --> 00:33:39,030
Scott: Don't fuck around with them.

489
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:49,110
Scott: But most of the time when we're talking about swords is I'm with the dangers of spending all your money on them Yeah, which if I had money when I would say in high school or middle school, I would have spent it on too many swords.

490
00:33:49,271 --> 00:33:50,918
Scott: Oh, thankfully I did not do that.

491
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:53,510
Scott: We you know, this is this is our sword thing, right?

492
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:58,010
Scott: It's like we have this sort like don't buy swords thing and this other group of people make these YouTube videos.

493
00:33:58,050 --> 00:33:59,741
Scott: They have their don't buy swords thing.

494
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:01,170
Scott: So we have a connection with them.

495
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:04,679
Rym: Don't don't not buy swords.

496
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,105
Rym: So they will cut you.

497
00:34:06,125 --> 00:34:11,730
Scott: so, you know You know the old trick where like you make it look like you took your thumb off right like this.

498
00:34:11,991 --> 00:34:13,358
Scott: Oh, yeah, I'm not even doing it that well.

499
00:34:13,378 --> 00:34:14,524
Scott: I'm doing trick.

500
00:34:14,563 --> 00:34:15,770
Scott: How well am I doing it poorly?

501
00:34:17,851 --> 00:34:19,077
Rym: I can see your thumb bent backwards.

502
00:34:19,097 --> 00:34:19,639
Scott: I'm bad at it.

503
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:19,860
Scott: Right?

504
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,949
Rym: Anyway, I can't even see myself in the video, right?

505
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:28,090
Scott: the point is You know, it's an old trick, you know when no one gets fooled by that right unless you're like a little kid.

506
00:34:29,091 --> 00:34:35,230
Scott: But this guy on YouTube, I don't even know you could push this trick to such limits.

507
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:39,350
Scott: I don't even I have to go frame by frame to see how he even does the last part.

508
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:42,344
Scott: I mean I got an idea but it's like I watch it once.

509
00:34:42,525 --> 00:34:44,935
Rym: he just moves real quick He pushes this trick.

510
00:34:44,975 --> 00:34:49,090
Scott: He has practiced this way too much and it's like god damn.

511
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:58,561
Scott: I would not be surprised if he legit had like either crazy fingers that like flex and in improbable ways or Literally actual fake fingers.

512
00:34:58,601 --> 00:35:00,190
Scott: that is hyper realistic or something.

513
00:35:00,292 --> 00:35:05,990
Rym: I mean as a kid I got a magic set like one of those box magic sets kids get and it came with a fake thumb and a fake finger.

514
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:08,860
Scott: Yeah, mine also came with this pink rubbery finger.

515
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,890
Scott: It's obviously fake and you know magic with it.

516
00:35:12,091 --> 00:35:12,513
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

517
00:35:12,533 --> 00:35:15,910
Rym: I used it for I covered blood and throw it at people instead of using it a magic trick.

518
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:19,384
Rym: Yeah, it's a Halloween decoration a magic trick I did with it.

519
00:35:19,404 --> 00:35:20,970
Rym: That's kind of relevant to my thing of the day.

520
00:35:21,351 --> 00:35:30,745
Rym: it was a magic trick that I just used to scare my grandparents where I'd use that finger and I act like I'm doing this complicated knife trick and then I Accidentally cut my thumb off and have blood spray everywhere.

521
00:35:30,765 --> 00:35:33,947
Scott: Yeah, that's a. That's how they do.

522
00:35:34,772 --> 00:35:40,849
Rym: But this is only 16 seconds long and you might think like how far can they push this trick in 16 seconds?

523
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:41,667
Scott: It's pretty good.

524
00:35:41,871 --> 00:35:42,515
Scott: I think you could.

525
00:35:42,535 --> 00:35:49,790
Scott: the the 16 seconds you spent Listening to us is way more wasted than the 16 seconds you can spend watching this video number 5 on trending.

526
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:51,597
Rym: Is this trending or something right now?

527
00:35:52,038 --> 00:35:53,825
Rym: Oh, I think people are seeing this.

528
00:35:53,845 --> 00:35:54,307
Rym: Maybe that's how.

529
00:35:54,327 --> 00:35:55,150
Rym: how did you find this?

530
00:35:55,391 --> 00:35:55,752
Scott: I don't know.

531
00:35:56,094 --> 00:35:56,515
Rym: You don't know.

532
00:35:56,556 --> 00:35:57,198
Rym: it just came in.

533
00:35:57,218 --> 00:35:59,910
Scott: I just I read a lot of internet every day.

534
00:36:00,171 --> 00:36:01,536
Scott: You know how much internet I read.

535
00:36:02,038 --> 00:36:12,498
Rym: there was just a study that was released today saying that the average white-collar worker in the United States consumes 12 hours of Content per day on average.

536
00:36:13,181 --> 00:36:15,430
Scott: I don't think I do that much because I'm only at work for eight hours.

537
00:36:17,754 --> 00:36:18,930
Scott: So that would not be possible.

538
00:36:19,011 --> 00:36:29,153
Scott: You got to subtract the time I'm working sleeping and eating also at eight hours and then when I'm at home definitely not four hours Unless you can't.

539
00:36:29,173 --> 00:36:32,745
Scott: I mean, you know playing games doesn't count as internet content.

540
00:36:32,806 --> 00:36:34,090
Rym: It counts as consuming media.

541
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:36,721
Scott: I think yeah, but I mean it depends what you count.

542
00:36:36,741 --> 00:36:38,027
Scott: right if I'm reading comics in bed.

543
00:36:38,067 --> 00:36:38,589
Scott: Does that count?

544
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:40,012
Rym: Let's see.

545
00:36:40,413 --> 00:36:41,457
Rym: Thanks to multitasking.

546
00:36:41,538 --> 00:36:44,950
Rym: Oh, so people, you know people might have two media streams on at the same time.

547
00:36:45,334 --> 00:36:46,000
Scott: I don't do that.

548
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:46,970
Scott: I don't do that either.

549
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:50,863
Rym: I do that occasionally, but only when the task I'm doing is rote.

550
00:36:51,124 --> 00:36:52,890
Scott: I'm only doing one one at a time.

551
00:36:53,251 --> 00:36:57,346
Scott: Oh wait, does it count if I have music playing while reading a web page?

552
00:36:57,667 --> 00:36:58,470
Rym: I don't know.

553
00:36:59,192 --> 00:37:00,436
Rym: I did not read the article.

554
00:37:00,456 --> 00:37:04,310
Rym: Yeah, cuz your slash shot right gonna read the article anyway.

555
00:37:05,351 --> 00:37:07,739
Rym: In the moment the book of the book is Frank Herbert's Dune.

556
00:37:07,779 --> 00:37:11,410
Rym: Don't even talk to us until I beat Gannon, which is coming along.

557
00:37:11,591 --> 00:37:14,241
Scott: I'm I could go begin and I just I only got.

558
00:37:14,462 --> 00:37:15,706

571
00:37:45,872 --> 00:37:46,859
Scott: I don't even know where the start is.

572
00:37:46,879 --> 00:37:48,269
Rym: So remember I said you can buy a house.

573
00:37:48,582 --> 00:37:54,550
Rym: Yeah If you buy that house The builders dealing with that house are free to go off and do their show.

574
00:37:54,711 --> 00:37:57,123
Scott: I didn't buy the house cuz I'm saving my money for other stuff first.

590
00:38:27,696 --> 00:38:30,206
Scott: for fairy fountains and the fourth one cost 10,000 rupees.

591
00:38:32,052 --> 00:38:34,967
Scott: But I got the horse fairy fountain, but I need the 3,000 rupees to open it.

592
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:38,261
Rym: I'm way more excited about the horse fairy than I am about the.

593
00:38:38,522 --> 00:38:40,490
Rym: is it actually a giant like sexy horse?

594
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:40,811
Rym: It comes.

595
00:38:40,892 --> 00:38:43,562
Scott: I haven't opened it because I need 3,000 rupees.

596
00:38:43,582 --> 00:38:47,339
Rym: if that fairy does not have a horse head I'm gonna be legit disappointed.

597
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:49,369
Rym: I'm just saying it's gotta have a horse head.

598
00:38:51,251 --> 00:38:51,995
Rym: Otherwise we were.

599
00:38:52,076 --> 00:38:53,262
Rym: I was just at Zenkai Con.

600
00:38:53,282 --> 00:38:54,248
Rym: we did three panels super fun.

601
00:38:55,213 --> 00:38:56,479
Rym: I guess the next con will be out.

602
00:38:56,539 --> 00:38:58,026
Rym: is Kinetic Con exciting?

603
00:38:58,227 --> 00:39:02,400
Rym: and then Pax Unplugged and then Pax West and then Pax Australia.

604
00:39:02,421 --> 00:39:06,714
Scott: I mean if you're listening to this you've already probably found us everywhere On the internet that we are.

605
00:39:06,774 --> 00:39:10,930
Scott: but we are on all the places of the internet that exists particularly YouTube.

606
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:12,536
Rym: We got in that way many.

607
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:16,954
Scott: we have many youtubes and Twitter's and we even have Facebook And we got.

608
00:39:16,994 --> 00:39:18,059
Scott: we have a fucking everything.

609
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,457
Scott: if there's a place on the internet that people post things We have a thing there and we post there.

610
00:39:22,898 --> 00:39:33,164
Scott: so go to all the places that you use on the internet and find us Rym and me and GeekNights and follow all But then don't actually watch any of the content.

611
00:39:33,406 --> 00:39:43,612
Rym: Yeah So in other news meaning the actual main bid we I guess did a show on DRM.

612
00:39:43,732 --> 00:39:44,053
Rym: never.

613
00:39:44,073 --> 00:39:46,179
Rym: I don't know how that never happened.

614
00:39:46,319 --> 00:39:49,568
Rym: I feel like we did it like I almost remember doing it.

615
00:39:50,532 --> 00:39:51,880
Rym: I feel I feel like we've talked about.

616
00:39:52,101 --> 00:39:56,439
Rym: I feel like this was the primary thing I was mad about for like eight years of my life.

617
00:39:56,780 --> 00:40:00,010
Rym: Yeah, and yet somehow we've never talked about it.

618
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,158
Scott: It was a big problem, man.

619
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:02,710
Scott: It's still a problem, but much smaller one.

620
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:03,275
Scott: So here's the deal.

621
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:10,749
Scott: DRM is digital rights management And what DRM is is you have some data and you want to give that data to somebody else?

622
00:40:11,111 --> 00:40:14,270
Scott: Yeah, you want to make it available and so you share it around.

623
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:21,431
Scott: But you only want people to be able to use read that data if they have permissions to do So.

624
00:40:21,491 --> 00:40:23,320
Scott: for example, I am Adobe.

625
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,324
Scott: I made Photoshop.

626
00:40:24,384 --> 00:40:25,510
Scott: Photoshop is just data.

627
00:40:25,911 --> 00:40:36,540
Scott: It's just an exe file Photoshop that exe and people can just download the fucking thing Right and they if some one person downloads it or gets it on a CD or USB stick They can just give it to someone else.

628
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:37,910
Scott: It's just data they can copy up.

629
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:45,930
Scott: It's just a giant number, but they do not want people who do not pay for Photoshop to be able to use Photoshop.

630
00:40:46,131 --> 00:40:56,689
Scott: So they put some special code in there to make that Difficult to use the Photoshop if you have not paid for and that is DRM and there are many mechanisms for doing this.

631
00:40:57,192 --> 00:41:01,414
Scott: But the fundamental idea is that you have a thing I could imagine.

632
00:41:01,535 --> 00:41:04,710
Scott: you have a treasure chest and the Photoshop is in the treasure chest and it's locked.

633
00:41:05,152 --> 00:41:08,630
Scott: So you give out treasure chests with Photoshop inside to everybody.

634
00:41:09,393 --> 00:41:12,789
Scott: But only some people got keys to open it.

635
00:41:13,552 --> 00:41:18,870
Scott: The problem is you're also giving people the keys so they can also copy the key.

636
00:41:19,071 --> 00:41:21,009
Rym: Oh, like there's the key is also data.

637
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:28,490
Rym: So DVDs and blu-rays right like if you have encryption on the discs so they can only be played in legitimate players.

638
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:35,853
Scott: So the legitimate DVD players have keys in them and the DVDs themselves are locked treasure chest with movies inside But those keys.

639
00:41:35,913 --> 00:41:40,450
Scott: and if you put the DVD into an illegitimate DVD player that DVD player does not have the key.

640
00:41:40,852 --> 00:41:44,050
Scott: So we can only watch DVDs that are unlocked treasure chest.

641
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:51,662
Scott: It can't watch ones that are locked except if I buy a legit DVD player Once the keys are in there and I can take them out.

642
00:41:51,943 --> 00:41:55,458
Rym: They might be complicated keys Yeah, but they're still just keys.

643
00:41:55,518 --> 00:41:59,896
Scott: It might be hard to get them out of there, but they're in there and They are.

644
00:41:59,996 --> 00:42:03,990
Rym: there's an angry nerd somewhere who will get the key out of there and put it on the internet, right?

645
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:05,495
Scott: And that's how DRM works.

646
00:42:05,555 --> 00:42:12,987
Scott: It's like it's never foolproof because the fundamental concept behind it is just Absolutely flawed from the get-go, right?

647
00:42:13,711 --> 00:42:25,970
Rym: The so so arguably, you know when we talk about DRM the kind of DRM that pertains to subscription software Does work more so and also is pretty justifiable.

648
00:42:26,311 --> 00:42:31,127
Rym: Yeah, I don't have problems saying it's not justified in all case, but it also the main reason it can work.

649
00:42:31,228 --> 00:42:42,064
Rym: Is that unlike most things people talk about with DRM because they're usually talking about Static media like movies or songs when it comes to software.

650
00:42:42,406 --> 00:42:43,590
Rym: There's no analog hole.

651
00:42:43,992 --> 00:42:47,470
Rym: I can't just take a picture of my screen and now I've got a copy of that.

652
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:50,230
Scott: Oh, that's only one of the flaws of DRM, right?

653
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:59,489
Scott: the main flaw of DRM is the one we talked about which is that the key is also digital and once someone gets the Key, you're giving people the lock and the key and once they have everything they have everything.

654
00:42:59,549 --> 00:43:00,733
Scott: right now It's making it difficult.

655
00:43:01,154 --> 00:43:04,867
Scott: the other flaw of DRM specifically on media such as a movie.

656
00:43:04,887 --> 00:43:10,570
Scott: It's like, okay Let's say I never figured out the key to unencrypt this DVD and it only plays my legitimate DVD player.

657
00:43:10,951 --> 00:43:16,070
Scott: It still has to send that video to my television and even if you use they do have DRM.

658
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:19,318
Scott: It's called HDCP on HDMI cables, and that's new.

659
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:20,220
Rym: it used to not exist.

660
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:24,050
Scott: So I can't record easily from the HDMI cable itself.

661
00:43:25,932 --> 00:43:26,834
Scott: I can't trick right.

662
00:43:27,015 --> 00:43:31,088
Scott: I can still point a camera at my television and record everything.

663
00:43:31,228 --> 00:43:36,609
Scott: So Congratulations, in fact my grandfather I can't point a camera at my monitor and record Photoshop.

664
00:43:37,171 --> 00:43:44,819
Rym: so my grandfather who is real old was a carpenter and and I'm cabinet maker when he was young too.

665
00:43:44,839 --> 00:44:03,395
Rym: and He in the earliest earliest days when when photocopies existed he immediately would get catalogs of Big enough to just use.

666
00:44:03,917 --> 00:44:08,190
Rym: he was pirating that stuff in the like pre-internet days.

667
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:11,407
Scott: So their DRM was pretty much make it really small so no one can see.

668
00:44:11,427 --> 00:44:12,895
Rym: yep It's like by the pattern.

669
00:44:12,975 --> 00:44:16,230
Scott: here's a catalog of patterns and it has pictures of the patterns.

670
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:17,615
Scott: Yeah, there's no tiny thing.

671
00:44:17,635 --> 00:44:21,690
Scott: Why don't you just send them money and they'll send you the pattern, you know at full size.

672
00:44:22,111 --> 00:44:29,790
Scott: But he just take the tiny picture of a pattern make it bigger and now we can see it, but it more technological Even though that not that that wasn't technology.

673
00:44:30,211 --> 00:44:33,946
Rym: We had a fancy camcorder like a really fancy one that the family all share.

674
00:44:33,966 --> 00:44:34,709
Scott: still took VHS tapes.

675
00:44:35,171 --> 00:44:38,483
Rym: It took VHS tapes, but back then full-size ones.

676
00:44:38,523 --> 00:44:40,330
Scott: Not the small ones that you put into the full size.

677
00:44:40,672 --> 00:44:48,145
Rym: It was not easy to copy VHS tapes that had copy protection because there was copy protection on VHS tapes.

678
00:44:48,446 --> 00:44:51,229
Rym: It's this complicated analog thing We've talked about in old episodes of GeekNights.

679
00:44:51,371 --> 00:45:01,546
Scott: There's also the little piece of plastic where the VCR VCR will refuse to record onto a VHS tape if that piece of plastic has been punched out.

680
00:45:01,566 --> 00:45:07,970
Scott: and that's a good thing because you won't Accidentally overwrite the Aladdin VHS tape you bought with say an episode of the Simpsons.

681
00:45:09,152 --> 00:45:14,530
Rym: But that macro vision copy protection worked only because it was a signal on the tape itself.

682
00:45:14,991 --> 00:45:29,898
Rym: So my grandpa took the big TV and he pointed the camcorder at the TV And he plugged the audio inputs on the camcorder into the speaker outputs of the TV and that is how he pirated shit Mm-hmm, and that was legit like it worked

683
00:45:30,179 --> 00:45:33,130
Scott: and then for those days you would not be disappointed with the quality nowadays.

684
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:35,089
Scott: You'd look at that and be like, oh my god, it's unwatchable.

685
00:45:35,236 --> 00:45:39,024
Rym: Yeah but but with with with static media the analog hole exists.

686
00:45:39,044 --> 00:45:46,049
Rym: no matter what I mean right now like Crunchyroll or anything like that if I want to get a clip for a panel I just fire up OBS and record my screen.

687
00:45:46,471 --> 00:45:47,293
Rym: It totally works.

688
00:45:47,634 --> 00:45:56,519
Rym: if I need audio I can literally pipe the music that is being played from the thing no matter how copy protect It is through my mixer and then back into audition.

689
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:57,281
Scott: Yeah, they've.

690
00:45:57,622 --> 00:46:00,230
Scott: they've mostly given up on copy protection for music these days.

691
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:05,470
Scott: Yeah, pretty much all that Apple gives you like DRM free, you know, AC files or whatever.

692
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:13,909
Rym: yep video is interesting because they've definitely not given up on it and People care less because streaming services exist now, right?

693
00:46:14,311 --> 00:46:19,010
Scott: Right, it's like, you know, they made it Spotify Netflix whatnot.

694
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:23,910
Scott: They've made it to the point where it's easier to not pirate.

695
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:24,693
Scott: That was the only thing.

696
00:46:24,733 --> 00:46:28,749
Scott: people were pirating these things because it was hard to get it legit.

697
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:29,980
Scott: now It's like you pay for Netflix.

698
00:46:30,061 --> 00:46:40,810
Scott: It's way cheap and You can just watch everything with one button press and it plays immediately Which is even easier than in Napster days where you would type it in press enter and then double click and it would play.

699
00:46:40,871 --> 00:46:43,897
Scott: This is even less steps Even less steps.

700
00:46:44,018 --> 00:46:53,990
Rym: Yeah, so and even now I pay for music services Even though I used to pirate music to the point that pirating music might have arguably been a distinct hobby unto itself for me.

701
00:46:54,291 --> 00:47:00,590
Scott: Right, but these streaming services are still using DRM Even if you're not paying attention because you're not trying to pirate anything.

702
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:10,270
Scott: Yeah, Netflix does not want you to be able to download their show and keep a copy of it forever Right, and that's they remove things from Netflix sometimes, right?

703
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:14,472
Scott: If you could just download things forever that were on there that wouldn't work out too Well.

704
00:47:14,673 --> 00:47:17,270
Scott: when they're trying to remove things so you can't watch them anymore.

705
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:18,033
Rym: Oh a big example.

706
00:47:18,073 --> 00:47:20,141
Rym: example of a problem was until recently you would.

707
00:47:20,181 --> 00:47:26,169
Scott: you would be in a situation you paying for Netflix for one Month download fucking everything right and then cancel it.

708
00:47:27,352 --> 00:47:31,063
Rym: Days of red octane when I got the maximum subscription plan.

709
00:47:31,465 --> 00:47:38,747
Rym: I rented every single Ps1 game I ever wanted in my life and ran them through the Plex tour as fast as I could.

710
00:47:39,028 --> 00:47:43,575
Scott: in high school There was a. it was a gang not a legit gang But you know a gang of kids.

711
00:47:43,916 --> 00:47:48,370
Scott: and what they would do is they would go to Blockbuster and rent PlayStation one games.

712
00:47:49,671 --> 00:47:55,390
Scott: Everyone would copy them right and so it's cost you like five bucks each, but there were like ten people.

713
00:47:55,572 --> 00:47:57,009
Rym: Ah, but there was a second component to that.

714
00:47:57,170 --> 00:48:00,989
Rym: Everyone's PlayStation had to have a DRM crack in the form of a mod.

715
00:48:01,413 --> 00:48:02,083
Scott: Everyone had that.

716
00:48:02,144 --> 00:48:03,032
Scott: so yeah You would.

717
00:48:03,313 --> 00:48:07,610
Scott: basically everyone would go to Blockbuster with five bucks and that would be like ten people.

718
00:48:07,891 --> 00:48:10,649
Scott: But you basically getting ten PlayStation games for five dollars.

719
00:48:11,512 --> 00:48:18,432
Scott: Right you copied them all and then you returned them all and then you could do it again and get 20 PlayStation games for ten Dollars.

720
00:48:18,794 --> 00:48:27,179
Scott: it just like the math was so great on that for the price of one Blockbuster rental You got the number of friends you had Times number of PlayStation games.

721
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:30,049
Scott: because you would everyone would make one copy of theirs.

722
00:48:30,752 --> 00:48:32,457
Scott: So thinking I mean all bunch times everybody.

723
00:48:32,517 --> 00:48:35,967
Scott: think about how old plus the price of blank CDs.

724
00:48:36,047 --> 00:48:41,310
Rym: think about how old-style Piracy wasn't that much of an economic impact because of the physical reality of it.

725
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:47,230
Rym: You know it wasn't as easy and widespread for mass copying and what you guys did was also pretty small scale.

726
00:48:47,631 --> 00:48:51,722
Rym: But when I was doing it with red octane there was an economy of scale.

727
00:48:51,923 --> 00:49:02,026
Rym: I could get someone to mail me all Those CDs as fast as I could copy them right because copy in a PlayStation game back Then like you had to burn that shit at 1x.

728
00:49:03,311 --> 00:49:04,455
Rym: There's a lot of reasons.

729
00:49:04,495 --> 00:49:05,238
Rym: they took a while.

730
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:09,796
Scott: in the olden days right when technology wasn't as powerful They had other kinds of DRM.

731
00:49:09,816 --> 00:49:12,890
Scott: for example you bought a say an old video game like star control, right?

732
00:49:13,110 --> 00:49:14,697
Scott: Oh, and you would install.

733
00:49:14,757 --> 00:49:19,229
Scott: you could you could copy this game on floppy disks and give it to all your friends And everyone had to copy a star control.

734
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:22,981
Scott: But when you open up star control you type star con dot exe.

735
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:28,782
Scott: it would open up and it would be like hello What is the star located?

736
00:49:28,802 --> 00:49:30,610
Scott: and you had this physical star chart?

737
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:33,803
Scott: It was like a spinny cardboard on a thing and you're just.

738
00:49:34,004 --> 00:49:39,973
Scott: it came in the box with the game And you just spin it around and mess with the star chart and answer the question It was giving you.

739
00:49:40,033 --> 00:49:46,039
Scott: sometimes they'd ask questions like yeah on page whatever of the rule book What is the tenth word on what?

740
00:49:46,059 --> 00:49:49,150
Rym: and it's like quest for glory to did a really clever one?

741
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:51,018
Scott: There was so many like what are you gonna do?

742
00:49:51,078 --> 00:49:53,510
Scott: photocopy the whole goddamn rule book and give it to every?

743
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:55,597
Rym: And it's like pain in the ass.

744
00:49:55,637 --> 00:49:56,239
Rym: think about this.

745
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:57,182
Rym: that was an error.

746
00:49:57,282 --> 00:50:01,435
Scott: make your own star chart somehow perfectly Just like the one that came in the box.

747
00:50:01,535 --> 00:50:08,638
Rym: That was an era when floppy disks and computers were widely available But copy machines were not.

748
00:50:09,019 --> 00:50:10,384
Scott: it was much harder to come on.

749
00:50:10,404 --> 00:50:11,307
Rym: machines are like that.

750
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:15,864
Scott: stuffs by since Rule books that came with PC games were large.

751
00:50:15,884 --> 00:50:17,310
Scott: Yeah, we're full books.

752
00:50:17,572 --> 00:50:22,949
Rym: And if you end in those days if you wanted to make photocopies It's not like now where you could just go to a photocopy machine to just do it.

753
00:50:23,251 --> 00:50:27,351
Rym: You'd go to like a cake goes and hand them the thing and say here's the copies I want.

754
00:50:27,371 --> 00:50:28,420
Scott: they weren't gonna do that.

755
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:29,730
Rym: They would run the machine for you.

756
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:33,969
Rym: Yeah, I went in there a lot of times with D&D books, and they were like nope fuck you.

757
00:50:34,251 --> 00:50:36,318
Rym: Yeah, not helping you pirate that D&D book.

758
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:37,964
Rym: I know exactly what you're doing.

759
00:50:38,125 --> 00:50:39,510
Scott: I'll copy the character sheet for you.

760
00:50:39,831 --> 00:50:44,929
Rym: They would not actually copy the character sheet really even though it had a disclaimer on it saying you can copy this.

761
00:50:45,914 --> 00:50:46,949
Rym: That was a long time ago.

762
00:50:48,131 --> 00:50:50,830
Scott: Yeah, obviously quest for glory to download a PDF pushprint.

763
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:52,481
Scott: It was this giant folder that you have.

764
00:50:52,562 --> 00:50:53,790
Scott: use it on your tablet don't even print.

765
00:50:54,251 --> 00:51:00,010
Rym: It was a giant fold-out map of the main town and all the streets and the town is just super complicated.

766
00:51:00,632 --> 00:51:06,490
Rym: And if you did not have a physical copy of that map in color the game worked fine and nothing changed.

767
00:51:06,550 --> 00:51:12,970
Rym: It never asked you for anything, but good luck ever fucking finding anything or ever getting anywhere in that maze.

768
00:51:13,512 --> 00:51:16,722
Rym: I guess you could figure it out, but it would be.

769
00:51:16,742 --> 00:51:22,770
Rym: imagine all three of the Labyrinths in Breath of the Wild and make it about five times bigger than that.

770
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:24,720
Rym: That's like the size of this stupid.

771
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:26,689
Scott: You could map it out on your own with a pencil and a paper.

772
00:51:26,931 --> 00:51:29,243
Rym: Yeah, and you know what I feel like if someone did that.

773
00:51:29,323 --> 00:51:29,926
Rym: like good on you.

774
00:51:29,947 --> 00:51:30,590
Rym: You're in that game.

775
00:51:30,610 --> 00:51:31,916
Scott: Well, they like some people like doing that.

776
00:51:31,936 --> 00:51:32,880
Scott: you're like Etrian Odyssey.

777
00:51:33,222 --> 00:51:35,050
Rym: Yeah, I understand the appeal of that.

778
00:51:35,712 --> 00:51:38,742
Rym: I did not make any maps in the in any of the mazes.

779
00:51:38,782 --> 00:51:39,585
Rym: I've done recently.

780
00:51:39,605 --> 00:51:44,102
Rym: I used the the Variant of the left-hand rule mm-hmm.

781
00:51:44,786 --> 00:51:45,430
Rym: He's got to be careful.

782
00:51:45,731 --> 00:51:48,420
Rym: It is possible design maps that have left-hand rule traps.

783
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:49,483
Rym: It'll take you in loops forever.

784
00:51:49,724 --> 00:51:49,945
Scott: Yep.

785
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:51,009
Scott: Good maze.

786
00:51:51,249 --> 00:51:51,812
Rym: Yep That's there.

787
00:51:51,832 --> 00:51:55,810
Rym: That's a real good maze if there's more than one of those traps pro pro maze.

788
00:51:56,691 --> 00:52:03,112
Rym: So uh yeah DRM actually was a much more dangerous topic Early well.

789
00:52:03,133 --> 00:52:04,940
Scott: the other thing like before get night.

790
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,590
Scott: the other thing about DRM is like we said is easily broken.

791
00:52:07,731 --> 00:52:10,090
Scott: So it's not like if it was not breakable.

792
00:52:10,692 --> 00:52:19,076
Scott: This would be a really big problem because so much of the culture of the world would sort of be trapped and like you know For preservation for shit.

793
00:52:19,096 --> 00:52:20,139
Scott: for all these reasons, right?

794
00:52:20,199 --> 00:52:23,590
Scott: It's real that could be very harmful, but luckily it's easily breakable, right?

795
00:52:23,730 --> 00:52:24,652
Scott: Yep Here's the thing.

796
00:52:25,214 --> 00:52:35,125
Scott: in the United States at least the DMCA says you may not break DRM Except for these specific exceptions, right like unlocking your phone.

797
00:52:35,145 --> 00:52:36,630
Scott: I think has recently made an exception.

798
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:39,500
Scott: I think so, but I think I'm not 100% sure.

799
00:52:39,801 --> 00:52:50,327
Scott: but it's like if you if you break DRM Even in order to do something legal you're not violating copyright You're just breaking DRM for some other reason that is technically against the law to do this.

800
00:52:50,628 --> 00:52:53,970
Rym: Yep Now Portugal might be moving down the road of fixing this.

801
00:52:54,070 --> 00:53:01,015
Rym: I saw an article about that a little while ago doing research for the show, but The problem still is it.

802
00:53:01,597 --> 00:53:05,248
Rym: it was way worse earlier partly because are the US government.

803
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:08,890
Rym: you might Expect that our government's pretty bad about technology stuff.

804
00:53:09,251 --> 00:53:26,121
Rym: but there was this golden era from the mid 80s through the end of the 90s early 2000s where Both parties in our government were equally hostile to media technology and the internet and we're basically both Pushing legislation to ruin everything forever.

805
00:53:26,141 --> 00:53:31,602
Rym: This was the era of the CBD tPA And if you want to know how bad that law was and how dangerous it was.

806
00:53:31,923 --> 00:53:33,609
Rym: I remember that giant acronym to this day.

807
00:53:34,692 --> 00:53:36,795
Rym: Well initialism, I guess it's not technically an acronym.

808
00:53:36,996 --> 00:53:39,360
Rym: Mm-hmm, but that law basically said something like

809
00:53:39,932 --> 00:53:40,500
Scott: media

810
00:53:41,007 --> 00:54:01,602
Rym: can Must be tied to legitimate devices and can only be played on legitimate light devices by law like a device that can play media of any kind or even arguably a general-purpose computer was effectively banned under that law unless it had Government mandated copyright controls in it.

811
00:54:01,622 --> 00:54:02,084
Rym: Mm-hmm.

812
00:54:02,365 --> 00:54:05,316
Rym: Imagine if you couldn't run Linux Mm-hmm, like that kind of stuff.

813
00:54:05,476 --> 00:54:05,677
Rym: Yep.

814
00:54:05,858 --> 00:54:08,568
Rym: We've backed way away from that precipice.

815
00:54:08,728 --> 00:54:11,301
Rym: That's good And I mean the DMCA.

816
00:54:11,322 --> 00:54:12,490
Rym: it's kind of weak-toothed.

817
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:16,360
Rym: HDCP was actually broken a long time ago.

818
00:54:16,441 --> 00:54:18,168
Rym: Like people have broken that as far as I know.

819
00:54:19,992 --> 00:54:22,110
Rym: These you know DCSS CSS was broken.

820
00:54:22,572 --> 00:54:23,980
Rym: We've had a lot of luck breaking.

821
00:54:24,101 --> 00:54:32,450
Scott: most of the copyright DRM enforcement regimes that have been actually dangerous to this is less effort on breaking them lately because you don't need to because you can.

822
00:54:33,291 --> 00:54:42,990
Rym: Companies are finally giving you all the content you need but also the Fewer people are outraged about it because back then the outrage was you can't do things that you do today.

823
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:44,309
Rym: You'll lose access to stuff.

824
00:54:44,410 --> 00:54:51,789
Rym: But now because streaming so easy even though the were the streaming ecosystem is pretty heavily locked down.

825
00:54:51,869 --> 00:54:56,535
Rym: like unauthorized devices can't play streams You can't cash stuff.

826
00:54:56,836 --> 00:55:00,307
Rym: like until recently Netflix had no way to work if you didn't have internet connections.

827
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:07,350
Rym: and even now Actually Netflix is doing a good thing because their own content they'd let you download in cash locally.

828
00:55:07,573 --> 00:55:08,830
Scott: So yeah, that's partially good.

829
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:10,276
Scott: But so there's still bad.

830
00:55:10,316 --> 00:55:12,204
Scott: DRM is out there right out the John Deere.

831
00:55:12,244 --> 00:55:17,090
Scott: people can't buy a tractor And then they cannot repair the tractor can't replace the tire.

832
00:55:17,231 --> 00:55:19,870
Rym: You got to get a got to get an authorized tire, right?

833
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:24,815
Scott: And if they if they were to say try to repair their own tractor They would be breaking the DRM.

834
00:55:24,855 --> 00:55:37,924
Scott: that's in the tractor software and therefore it's against the law to repair the thing you own Which is why a lot of places are trying to make right to repair laws, which say regardless of any DRM bullshit You can repair something that you buy right?

835
00:55:37,984 --> 00:55:41,276
Scott: You can't be doing this bull Someone else to repair it, right?

836
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:43,283
Scott: You know, you're not licensing that tractor.

837
00:55:43,324 --> 00:55:43,805
Scott: You own it.

838
00:55:43,845 --> 00:55:44,628
Scott: You bought it, right?

839
00:55:44,648 --> 00:55:45,110
Scott: It's yours.

840
00:55:45,371 --> 00:55:53,120
Rym: I mean imagine the alternative a world where if you buy a Chevrolet car You can legally only get it serviced at the dealership.

841
00:55:53,321 --> 00:55:55,990
Scott: You cannot legally bring it anywhere else nor are you?

842
00:55:56,632 --> 00:56:02,710
Scott: If Chevy goes out of business, you can never repair the car ever and if you open the hood you could go to jail.

843
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:04,656
Rym: Yep, that's what it would be like.

844
00:56:04,716 --> 00:56:08,749
Rym: That's that's the danger of fully realized and effective DRM.

845
00:56:09,632 --> 00:56:14,327
Rym: But replace your car with the collected culture of mankind produced to date.

846
00:56:14,628 --> 00:56:19,210
Scott: Yep So some bad news for Netflix and others, right?

847
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:28,139
Scott: Google and even you know people you normally think of as not evil because they fight for things like net neutrality, but Even Tim Berners-Lee is on the wrong side of this one.

848
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:33,116
Scott: There's a thing called encrypted media something Yeah, me encrypted media extensions.

849
00:56:33,337 --> 00:56:36,145
Rym: I happen to have the Wikipedia page up about there.

850
00:56:36,225 --> 00:56:38,131
Scott: make the basically as part of HTTP.

851
00:56:38,151 --> 00:56:41,162
Scott: this is the web only not the internet just the web right.

852
00:56:41,182 --> 00:56:43,530
Scott: the standards for the web like HTML, right?

853
00:56:43,911 --> 00:56:45,230
Rym: Yes, listen to old GeekNights.

854
00:56:45,291 --> 00:56:47,248
Rym: you want to know the difference between the web and the internet

855
00:56:47,268 --> 00:57:00,090
Scott: but the w3c the organization that like decides what the standards for the web are gonna be which is then what People who make web browsers have to basically code to those standards to make sure that websites work on all browsers the same way.

856
00:57:00,694 --> 00:57:13,730
Scott: They decided almost certainly By a vote and the vote can only people who can vote or rich people who can pay to be a member like tens of Thousands of dollars to include DRM, you know these EME and the standards of the web.

857
00:57:13,810 --> 00:57:29,309
Scott: So now browsers if they want to be standard will have to include this DRM which would allow You know Netflix and other people to distribute DRM video Into people with just standard web browsers no extra software required.

858
00:57:29,329 --> 00:57:31,963
Rym: now There are some sound arguments on both sides.

859
00:57:32,063 --> 00:57:32,244
Rym: there

860
00:57:32,405 --> 00:57:33,350
Scott: are there are indeed

861
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:43,879
Rym: I mean the alternative and don't don't say that I'm necessarily speaking for this but One problem is that under the old under the regime where there is no official standard everyone rolls their own and

862
00:57:44,401 --> 00:57:50,543
Scott: everyone's using flash or Other everyone's installing some kind of garbage, you know, there's still.

863
00:57:50,583 --> 00:57:53,050
Scott: they're not gonna distribute their content without DRM, right?

864
00:57:53,170 --> 00:58:00,950
Scott: Yeah, they're gonna distribute the content with DRM there But they're gonna make you install some nonsense to do to get the content or you don't install the nonsense.

865
00:58:01,578 --> 00:58:02,470
Rym: So the argument comes down.

866
00:58:02,470 --> 00:58:04,977
Rym: In fact, this article says exactly what the argument is.

867
00:58:05,338 --> 00:58:09,689
Rym: the argument comes down to the alternative is not the web abandoning DRM.

868
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:17,890
Rym: It's media companies abandoning the web right and going fully proprietary Mm-hmm, which is probably true a lot of them have already.

869
00:58:17,890 --> 00:58:22,830
Scott: I mean that a lot of most people I don't imagine use net watch Netflix things on the Netflix website.

870
00:58:22,930 --> 00:58:24,598
Scott: They're going and using an app.

871
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:31,390
Scott: Yep, right usually embedded into some sort of No reason that that app has to talk to Netflix itself.

872
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:33,898
Scott: Netflix is server infrastructure via HTTP.

873
00:58:33,959 --> 00:58:36,848
Scott: it can talk to Netflix using any protocol that they come up with.

874
00:58:37,009 --> 00:58:42,370
Rym: Yep So so on one hand this is like from a pure technology standpoint.

875
00:58:42,752 --> 00:58:45,750
Rym: This is a thing people want to do with technology, so we should have some standards.

876
00:58:45,851 --> 00:58:49,130
Rym: So it works interoperably across platforms across browsers.

877
00:58:49,492 --> 00:58:58,787
Rym: But on the other hand the thing you're trying to do is from an ideological standpoint fundamentally dangerous to culture in the long run even if it has short-term positive economic impact.

878
00:58:59,008 --> 00:59:02,341
Rym: and let the fact that Capitalism say here's hard to make money here.

879
00:59:02,361 --> 00:59:04,550
Scott: the problems here the problems of this particular thing.

880
00:59:04,610 --> 00:59:13,187
Scott: Number one if you just include DRM and browsers like this automatic thing People who are currently distributing things for free might just decide to oh, it's really easy.

881
00:59:13,247 --> 00:59:13,989
Scott: use the standard DRM.

882
00:59:14,230 --> 00:59:15,014
Scott: It's built into everyone.

883
00:59:15,034 --> 00:59:15,576
Scott: Let's just use it.

884
00:59:15,596 --> 00:59:19,010
Scott: and now suddenly all these things are DRM that before were not DRM.

885
00:59:19,152 --> 00:59:25,150
Scott: Yeah, now number two Let's say you make an open source web browser like Firefox or something.

886
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:30,206
Scott: You cannot be including this DRM shit in this open source product, right?

887
00:59:30,226 --> 00:59:31,370
Scott: That's not gonna work out.

888
00:59:31,410 --> 00:59:35,249
Scott: That's fundamentally like against your license and such or you can't do this.

889
00:59:35,731 --> 00:59:41,670
Scott: You know, that's a problem depending on the license, of course Debbie and is not going to include a browser that has DRM.

890
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:52,488
Rym: Wikipedia EMA has been highly controversial because a quote places a necessarily proprietary Component into might what is otherwise an open and free software ecosystem.

891
00:59:52,628 --> 00:59:57,010
Scott: Yep Because you have to download the Nvidia driver separately when you install some Linux.

892
00:59:57,032 --> 00:59:59,377
Rym: Yeah Remember how we talked about keys before the.

893
00:59:59,658 --> 01:00:04,935
Rym: the key the code whatever it is that makes us hear it happen is Still just that key.

894
01:00:05,276 --> 01:00:09,030
Rym: so it has to be closed source or it cannot work.

895
01:00:09,219 --> 01:00:11,510
Scott: Yeah If it was open source just included in Firefox.

896
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:17,626
Scott: You could just read the source code of Firefox and it would basically have instructions on how to break the DRM in it Which is why it won't right?

897
01:00:18,550 --> 01:00:24,410
Rym: I've decided just now I'm oh, I'm for this being implemented and I have a pretty specific reason why.

898
01:00:25,373 --> 01:00:30,810
Rym: If we standardize on one way of doing a DRM you crack one key to crack the world.

899
01:00:31,112 --> 01:00:32,922
Scott: Sadly this DRM does not work that way.

900
01:00:33,022 --> 01:00:33,203
Scott: Yeah.

901
01:00:33,244 --> 01:00:37,802
Rym: Yeah as many keys You have to crack you'd have to fundamentally break its system.

902
01:00:38,003 --> 01:00:38,826
Scott: Yeah, I don't think it's.

903
01:00:39,007 --> 01:00:43,084
Scott: this is designed Well, the system was made by Google Netflix, etc.

904
01:00:43,205 --> 01:00:44,390
Scott: It's a whole team effort.

905
01:00:44,491 --> 01:00:46,230
Scott: It's gonna be very very hard for you to do that.

906
01:00:46,370 --> 01:00:50,350
Scott: Well, the other trouble is that the reason a lot of I do not think it is so fundamentally flawed.

907
01:00:50,390 --> 01:00:51,577
Scott: I think you could obviously well.

908
01:00:51,597 --> 01:00:57,530
Rym: the reason why other keys were more easily flawed Is that a lot of the things that consume media or that did DRM in the past?

909
01:00:58,092 --> 01:01:01,461
Rym: Can't reliably have access to an internet and change themselves.

910
01:01:01,481 --> 01:01:02,544
Scott: Yeah, this is for the web.

911
01:01:02,624 --> 01:01:03,306
Scott: It is internet.

912
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:03,587
Scott: Right?

913
01:01:03,627 --> 01:01:13,250
Scott: Anyway, the other problem with this is That let's say, you know web browsers are like the most important thing right like in terms of software on your computer.

914
01:01:13,310 --> 01:01:14,455
Scott: Yeah, the most it's.

915
01:01:14,475 --> 01:01:16,785
Scott: the number one application of the internet is the web.

916
01:01:17,348 --> 01:01:24,923
Scott: So People are constantly, you know Particularly security people, you know working on browsers.

917
01:01:25,324 --> 01:01:45,170
Scott: if browsers include DRM You might accidentally even though you're not trying to pirate any movies or anything Break the DRM while you're messing around with browsers because that's what you do Especially if you're a security investigator type person trying to find, you know security problems in the browser Security problems in that DRM that could threaten your whole computer.

918
01:01:45,471 --> 01:01:52,969
Scott: someone might use a flaw in the DRM system to just you know, turn your computer into You know some kind of spam bot or whatever.

919
01:01:53,431 --> 01:02:00,630
Scott: Security researchers might have to mess around with this DRM, but doing so is against the law because it's DRM and it's not something else.

920
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:02,330
Scott: So that's a problem.

921
01:02:02,330 --> 01:02:17,410
Rym: Here's some quotes while backers developers of Firefox were hesitant implementing the protocol for ethical reasons and dependency on proprietary code Firefox's implementation of it uses an open source sandbox to load the DRM modules which are treated as plugins.

922
01:02:18,233 --> 01:02:23,233
Rym: So they have this convoluted way to get around some of the potentially thorny legal Problems.

923
01:02:23,575 --> 01:02:27,190
Scott: Yeah, but basically, you know, the web is a hundred percent open right now.

924
01:02:27,350 --> 01:02:31,789
Scott: And now that this is basically saying, you know what some part of the web is not gonna be open now?

925
01:02:31,910 --> 01:02:39,169
Rym: Yep But the previous alternative was some parts of the web like in websites would be black holes with flash or something.

926
01:02:39,369 --> 01:02:45,086
Rym: Sure So it's replacing Non-standard black holes with standard widely implemented black holes.

927
01:02:45,729 --> 01:02:59,045
Rym: great It's hard to predict what specific impact this might have Because on one hand it might make for an easier proliferation of more streaming services and things like that but it could very easily be used for evil.

928
01:02:59,066 --> 01:03:03,401
Scott: and I think you'll see consumer benefits in that.

929
01:03:03,421 --> 01:03:08,330
Scott: you'll be able to just get like 4k Surround sound Netflix streams right in the browser.

930
01:03:08,430 --> 01:03:09,012
Scott: You'll

931
01:03:09,032 --> 01:03:26,190
Rym: see a consumer detriment in that only Windows and Macs will be able to be used to watch stuff forever after this point Like your Linux box ain't gonna work with any of this stuff probably unless you install proprietary closed-source browsers Depending on your distro by going out of band because they won't give them to you.

932
01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:33,070
Scott: It's gonna be one of those things where like the negative effects are all Even if they're significant or in the tech world where normal people don't see or care.

933
01:03:33,130 --> 01:03:35,728
Scott: But tech people are gonna go like and it's gonna suck ass.

934
01:03:35,889 --> 01:03:46,184
Rym: now The hope will be if it expands into causing the further dangers beyond the expected dangers Like even normal people were afraid of the CBD tPA and like.

935
01:03:46,224 --> 01:03:47,850
Rym: we're able to stop that nonsense?

936
01:03:47,991 --> 01:04:00,458
Rym: Yeah, so we got to make sure that the laws protecting these systems do not become worse than they already are and we need right to repair and right to archive and Right to study and right to research and all these other.

937
01:04:00,498 --> 01:04:05,057
Scott: you start seeing shit like wayback machine can't archive any pages anymore Cuz they're all DRM.

938
01:04:05,158 --> 01:04:06,144
Scott: Yeah, right.

939
01:04:06,507 --> 01:04:06,970
Scott: It's a problem.

940
01:04:07,332 --> 01:04:10,325
Rym: So there's nothing for you out there to do like.

941
01:04:10,486 --> 01:04:12,280
Rym: there's no activism You can do on this cuz.

942
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:15,830
Scott: yeah, it's already too late The final draft is in and you weren't rich enough to get a vote.

943
01:04:15,930 --> 01:04:24,790
Rym: Anyway, all you can do is keep an eye on this Like be aware that this exists and pay attention to when it starts encroaching.

944
01:04:25,271 --> 01:04:34,677
Rym: That's that's literally all you can do and figure out the line at which you start trying to get non nerds To be angry about it because no one's gonna care.

945
01:04:34,718 --> 01:04:38,990
Rym: right now the the feast at the buffet of streaming is still too great.

946
01:04:45,265 --> 01:04:47,800
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

Rym: I see that patreon did something weird with their podcast feeds.

970
01:06:23,375 --> 01:06:27,675
Rym: So I'm I have some content I haven't uploaded yet because I'm trying to figure out what happened there first.

971
01:06:27,957 --> 01:06:30,336
Rym: It wasn't just me It was everything in patreon as far as I can see.

972
01:06:31,462 --> 01:06:40,632
Rym: Expect a whole bunch of rants and roomly reviews and other stuff to be coming up in the near future Now that I have a long break between conventions.
