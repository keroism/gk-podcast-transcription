1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,747
Rym: It's Wednesday, March 23rd, 2016.

2
00:00:09,747 --> 00:00:09,968
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,326 --> 00:00:13,760
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,585
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,646 --> 00:00:19,880
Rym: Tonight, we fully review Gravity Falls now that it's fully done.

6
00:00:21,942 --> 00:00:22,979
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:43,000
Rym: So one of the reasons way back when Emily and I moved into the building where the GeekNights studio is and everything, we picked it because it had a good view, and a nice roof, and the apartment was nice, and it had bike parking in the building, which in New York City is a really, really important thing.

8
00:00:43,101 --> 00:00:44,360
Scott: I have bike parking in my building.

9
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,740
Rym: Well, you put it out on your balcony.

10
00:00:46,042 --> 00:00:46,131
Rym: Yeah.

11
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:46,483
Rym: Eh.

12
00:00:47,282 --> 00:00:47,780
Scott: What do you mean eh?

13
00:00:48,241 --> 00:00:52,000
Rym: Eh, it's moisture and it's outside and I gotta carry it up the elevator every day.

14
00:00:52,582 --> 00:00:53,649
Scott: You don't carry it in an elevator.

15
00:00:53,669 --> 00:00:54,614
Scott: The elevator does the carrying.

16
00:00:54,635 --> 00:00:55,520
Scott: That's what an elevator is.

17
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,080
Scott: Also, if it's rainy or wet, I just bring it inside.

18
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:58,887
Rym: Yeah, but that's a pain.

19
00:00:58,907 --> 00:01:00,100
Rym: I like to reduce clutter.

20
00:01:00,342 --> 00:01:01,019
Scott: Oh, such a pain.

21
00:01:01,601 --> 00:01:26,640
Rym: It's more of a pain than just having a bike parking room, but we were some of the first people to move into this building, and as time went on, the bike room got more and more crowded to the point that it is filled with bikes, like all tangled with each other, and as far as I can tell, there's only like four people in the building who actually fucking ride their bikes, and the rest of them just sit there unmoving forever, in the way, being a pain, and there's some racks you can hang the bikes from on hooks.

22
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:27,338
Scott: No one does it.

23
00:01:27,681 --> 00:01:39,640
Rym: No, they're all full with people who staked out a spot by writing their apartment number in Sharpie on the thing, and if anyone else puts their bike up there, they take it down with a passive-aggressive angry note.

24
00:01:40,881 --> 00:01:45,660
Rym: Even though the people who hang their bikes on that thing, I don't think have ever ridden them.

25
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,066
Scott: But this is another good reason.

26
00:01:47,086 --> 00:01:50,020
Scott: Just keep it in your apartment, because then you have to deal with the shared space drama.

27
00:01:50,020 --> 00:02:00,600
Rym: See, I didn't have to, because so few people rode their bikes that I basically just put my bike and Emily's bike right in the front of the room, in the middle of the room, blocking everything, because it didn't get in anyone's way.

28
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:08,699
Rym: The other few people who rode their bikes also just put them in the front, and basically everyone else was completely screwed if they wanted to ride their bikes, which I don't think they've ever tried to do.

29
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,879
Scott: If they didn't try to ride their bikes, wouldn't you steal their bikes or destroy them?

30
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,300
Rym: I'm pretty sure I could steal most of the bikes in there, and no one would have noticed.

31
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,659
Rym: I probably could have made a lot of money selling all those bikes.

32
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,759
Scott: Just sell all the bikes that you don't see get used ever.

33
00:02:21,301 --> 00:02:23,898
Scott: So anyway, my building- And they'll be like, "Why did these bikes not get

34
00:02:23,918 --> 00:02:24,039
Scott: stolen?".

35
00:02:24,422 --> 00:02:27,980
Rym: I imagine someone complained, because now we have real bike parking.

36
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:29,840
Rym: They took a giant room in the basement.

37
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,280
Scott: That used to be an illegal apartment.

38
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,687
Rym: It used to be an illegal apartment.

39
00:02:32,827 --> 00:02:36,439
Rym: Those people got kicked out, and now it is a giant- There's still an illegal apartment on the roof.

40
00:02:37,603 --> 00:02:38,048
Rym: I'm not sure.

41
00:02:38,068 --> 00:02:39,020
Rym: I haven't been up there to check.

42
00:02:39,181 --> 00:02:42,660
Rym: It has a big- I mean, it was an illegal apartment.

43
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:48,120
Scott: Okay, it has a sign on the front that says, like, "Storage Room" or something, but you can clearly see that there's an air conditioner.

44
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,639
Scott: Why would you have an air conditioner storage room?

45
00:02:50,202 --> 00:02:54,060
Scott: And why would there be a kitchen sink behind the air conditioner in a storage room?

46
00:02:54,641 --> 00:03:00,560
Rym: So, I am saying I have not peeked in that window to confirm if it is still an illegal apartment in the last few months.

47
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:01,201
Scott: Sure.

48
00:03:01,383 --> 00:03:02,980
Scott: I'm willing to bet it's still an illegal apartment.

49
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:09,700
Rym: And actually, they do usually, in buildings like this, put air conditioners and heating in the weird storage rooms that are outside of the normal space of the building.

50
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,659
Rym: Yeah, well, that was a utility sink.

51
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,271
Scott: With Dawn soap?

52
00:03:14,554 --> 00:03:15,040
Scott: With dishes?

53
00:03:15,484 --> 00:03:17,439
Rym: But no, yeah, someone was definitely living in there.

54
00:03:18,382 --> 00:03:23,040
Rym: But since I last confirmed that someone's probably living in there, I have not gone back to reconfirm.

55
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,405
Rym: So, it's possible.

56
00:03:24,425 --> 00:03:26,800
Rym: in the last few months it is no longer an illegal apartment.

57
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:27,644
Scott: It's possible.

58
00:03:27,724 --> 00:03:28,672
Scott: I'm not betting on it.

59
00:03:28,712 --> 00:03:29,640
Scott: It's an illegal apartment.

60
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,220
Scott: I think it's actually two illegal apartments, one on top of the other.

61
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,919
Rym: Well, the runner on the back, I wish I could move into that thing.

62
00:03:35,522 --> 00:03:36,980
Rym: That weird, like, top house.

63
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,800
Scott: Go to the illegal apartment in a different building.

64
00:03:39,042 --> 00:03:40,537
Rym: I just go knock on the door and be like, "Hey, what are you paying in

65
00:03:40,597 --> 00:03:40,759
Rym: rent?".

66
00:03:42,001 --> 00:03:46,079
Rym: "I'll sublet it from you for 100 bucks more a month and just get extra rooms in our apartment up

67
00:03:46,119 --> 00:03:46,240
Rym: there.".

68
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,760
Scott: But they're not going to be able to find a cheaper place than an illegal apartment.

69
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:52,220
Rym: I'm sure that the - I mean, how do you even go about getting the illegal apartment?

70
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,219
Scott: You find some commercial space and live in it.

71
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,389
Rym: Yeah, but that's not what they did here.

72
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,200
Rym: This is just a residential luxury building.

73
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:58,960
Scott: They knew somebody.

74
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,400
Rym: How do you - yeah, so I gotta know somebody.

75
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,530
Rym: I'll just ask the landlord - no, I'll ask the handyman, the super.

76
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,558
Rym: I'll be like, "Yo, you got any illegal rooms I can rent for, like, a

77
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:07,839
Rym: friend?".

78
00:04:08,725 --> 00:04:09,379
Rym: Just straight up.

79
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:14,460
Rym: So anyway, we got a new room in the basement and they put - you know those nice, like, wall mounts?

80
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,839
Rym: You put your bike up, there's, like, a lock built into it.

81
00:04:17,241 --> 00:04:18,519
Rym: They put a bunch of them down there.

82
00:04:18,861 --> 00:04:20,119
Scott: I wonder where the money for that came from.

83
00:04:20,421 --> 00:04:21,286
Rym: I guess people complained.

84
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:25,900
Rym: Like, a while ago, there was no hot water in the morning if you got up after, like, 8 o'clock for a couple weeks.

85
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,028
Rym: Really?

86
00:04:26,702 --> 00:04:29,916
Scott: And then, I guess - Whoa, I've never seen a large building run out of hot water.

87
00:04:30,702 --> 00:04:33,540
Rym: I guess people bitched because - Even hotels don't run out.

88
00:04:33,742 --> 00:04:34,935
Scott: Because I've been in hotels that ran out.

89
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,654
Scott: In the United States.

90
00:04:35,561 --> 00:04:38,799
Rym: I've been in hotels in the United States that were not quality inns where it ran out.

91
00:04:39,349 --> 00:04:39,480
Scott: What?

92
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,087
Scott: Yeah.

93
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,520
Scott: Like a Marriott or something?

94
00:04:42,381 --> 00:04:44,339
Rym: Uh, the Zenkai Khan Hotel last year.

95
00:04:45,402 --> 00:04:47,299
Scott: The Marriott one or the Jank one that we were in?

96
00:04:47,764 --> 00:04:48,438
Rym: I think the Jank one.

97
00:04:48,761 --> 00:04:51,339
Scott: The Jank one is, you know, it wasn't the one that the Khan is in.

98
00:04:51,660 --> 00:05:00,718
Rym: But anyway, so they have this new thing down there, and I see they put a sign in both elevators and in the stairways that said, "Hey, move your bikes to the new bike

99
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:00,919
Rym: room.".

100
00:05:01,142 --> 00:05:01,859
Scott: Yeah, I saw that sign.

101
00:05:02,061 --> 00:05:03,636
Rym: So I saw that sign, and I thought, "Oh,

102
00:05:03,757 --> 00:05:03,979
Rym: fuck.".

103
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,100
Rym: So immediately, I went down there with our bikes.

104
00:05:06,961 --> 00:05:09,299
Rym: And of course, no one had put their bikes down there yet.

105
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,900
Rym: So I took two of those nice bike parking spaces, and I wrote our apartment number on them.

106
00:05:13,961 --> 00:05:15,159
Rym: in a way it cannot be removed.

107
00:05:15,642 --> 00:05:17,419
Rym: And I locked our bikes to them, and they're ours.

108
00:05:17,981 --> 00:05:20,940
Rym: Because if other people are going to play that game, I'm going to play that game.

109
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,219
Scott: See, I just avoid the games.

110
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,060
Rym: Tragedy of the commons, I will always win.

111
00:05:25,482 --> 00:05:27,140
Scott: I just avoid the games entirely.

112
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,180
Rym: But no, it's convenient.

113
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,620
Rym: It's a nice room, and it's giant.

114
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,499
Rym: Like, bigger than our living room.

115
00:05:31,742 --> 00:05:33,120
Rym: So there's plenty of space for bikes down there.

116
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:33,658
Scott: Which is living it then.

117
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,480
Scott: Yeah, it used to be an illegal apartment.

118
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,580
Rym: Yeah, with weird steps.

119
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:45,564
Rym: It actually has a stepped area with carpet, a lot like the thing in that lounge we used to play D&D in in Peterson 3.

120
00:05:45,564 --> 00:05:47,480
Scott: So the bikes and buildings lie, I found something out.

121
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,340
Rym: The fact that it's actually completely toothless?

122
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:53,620
Scott: No, it's way more, for real, toothy than I ever imagined.

123
00:05:53,985 --> 00:05:54,280
Rym: Really?

124
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,540
Rym: Because I know of some loopholes that are guaranteed.

125
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,680
Scott: No, so apparently, here's a true story.

126
00:05:58,901 --> 00:05:59,640
Scott: You ready for this true story?

127
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,037
Scott: I'm ready.

128
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,920
Scott: Somebody was working in a midtown, large office building.

129
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,080
Rym: Wow, you're starting like a horror story.

130
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,880
Rym: Someone was working in a large midtown office building.

131
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,654
Scott: Okay, they tried to do some bike action, and the building was like, "Mm-mm, we're gonna be jerks and not make this

132
00:06:17,695 --> 00:06:18,018
Scott: happen.".

133
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:18,480
Scott: Right?

134
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,899
Scott: So they were parking their bikes outside and tying them up.

135
00:06:22,601 --> 00:06:23,979
Scott: And one of them got stole.

136
00:06:25,742 --> 00:06:28,980
Scott: They went to the small claims court against the building.

137
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:30,459
Rym: That's the way to do it.

138
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,499
Scott: And they won, like, boop, you win.

139
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,859
Scott: Here's enough money for your bike.

140
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,060
Rym: Now that's not, the law doesn't help with that, because the loophole, how they get out of the law, is actually real easy.

141
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,777
Rym: The building has to say, "Yes, we recognize your

142
00:06:41,817 --> 00:06:42,140
Rym: request.".

143
00:06:42,663 --> 00:06:44,355
Rym: And then they say, "You have to use the service

144
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:44,798
Rym: elevator.".

145
00:06:45,422 --> 00:06:51,560
Rym: And then they make the service elevator hours be slightly after when everyone has to get to work, and slightly before everyone has to leave work.

146
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,420
Scott: Apparently, you can avoid that bullshit also.

147
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:55,182
Rym: Oh?

148
00:06:55,681 --> 00:07:03,360
Rym: 'Cause I actually called the city way back with my old company asking about that, and the clerk lady I talked to said, "Yeah, that's how everyone gets around the law.

149
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,057
Rym: There's really no way to fix it unless you sue

150
00:07:05,077 --> 00:07:05,198
Rym: 'em.".

151
00:07:06,001 --> 00:07:08,740
Scott: Well, apparently, the thing is, I think if you sue 'em, you can win on that.

152
00:07:09,628 --> 00:07:11,060
Rym: I think they're not- No, I would sue.

153
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:11,917
Rym: Don't you?

154
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,270
Scott: Right?

155
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:17,160
Scott: So, yeah, we'll see what happens at my current building.

156
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,860
Scott: Me and Jose, we're gonna push.

157
00:07:19,461 --> 00:07:21,100
Scott: He's tying his bike up outside every day.

158
00:07:21,527 --> 00:07:22,119
Scott: I'm not doing that.

159
00:07:22,502 --> 00:07:27,560
Rym: I would, but I'd get my boss to give me in writing that if my bike gets stolen, they'll buy me a brand new bike of equivalent quality.

160
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:34,407
Scott: No, my bikes ... My, I guess, I don't know, two bosses up was like, "Yeah, I'm gonna work on this like a

161
00:07:34,448 --> 00:07:34,874
Scott: project.".

162
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:41,820
Scott: So, I emailed him the story that I saw, and all the infos, 'cause apparently it's much stronger than I suspected.

163
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,128
Scott: No.

164
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,140
Scott: Apparently, not only can tenants ask for it, but also subtenants.

165
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,939
Scott: Subtenant doesn't mean employee of a company.

166
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:54,957
Scott: Subtenant means one person's renting out the whole floor, and you're renting a piece from them.

167
00:07:55,543 --> 00:07:56,320
Scott: That's a subtenant.

168
00:07:56,421 --> 00:07:57,579
Scott: If you're a subtenant, you can do it.

169
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,360
Rym: See, I'd go further.

170
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:02,864
Rym: I say the law should stipulate that buildings that have elevators have to let you use bikes in them.

171
00:08:03,006 --> 00:08:04,040
Rym: full stop, no exceptions.

172
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:04,516
Rym: Fuck you.

173
00:08:05,063 --> 00:08:05,539
Scott: I agree.

174
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,299
Scott: That's what I would do if I have this law also.

175
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:07,529
Rym: Yup.

176
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,740
Rym: But anyway, so the bike room's there.

177
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:21,339
Scott: I got my bike in, and over the next week, pretty much all the bike parking spots- Stolen bike part is found in your bike shop?

178
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:22,679
Rym: They shoot you.

179
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:23,240
Scott: Yeah.

180
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,480
Scott: Also, if you're caught stealing a bike, death.

181
00:08:25,861 --> 00:08:26,800
Rym: We should just make death bikes.

182
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:35,220
Scott: Oh, also, before death, we have a bunch of cyclists who just volunteer every day, and we put you in a room with them for like 10 minutes.

183
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,339
Rym: We could just have death bikes.

184
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,820
Scott: And then if cyclists are bored one day, they can bike over and volunteer.

185
00:08:40,201 --> 00:08:41,947
Rym: You just put bikes around the city randomly.

186
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:46,839
Rym: that, if taken and ridden more than 20 feet- The seat explodes with spikes.

187
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:47,358
Scott: Yes.

188
00:08:49,023 --> 00:08:56,639
Scott: Anyway, so- What if someone takes- It's an emergency, and everyone's trying to escape the city, and someone just grabs one and goes- Well, you know what?

189
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:57,820
Rym: That sucks, Mad Max.

190
00:08:58,281 --> 00:08:59,479
Rym: That's how Mad Max goes.

191
00:08:59,720 --> 00:08:59,813
Rym: Okay.

192
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:13,629
Rym: So, like 12 people put their bikes down there, and the bike room that we're supposed to leave is still completely full of all the bikes that no one rides, and the deadline is basically within a week- Are there any way?

193
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,519
Scott: nice bikes in there?

194
00:09:14,943 --> 00:09:15,559
Rym: Way nice.

195
00:09:15,661 --> 00:09:18,540
Rym: There's a lot of really expensive bikes, but they're not really good bikes.

196
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,060
Rym: All the good bikes are the people who ride them, and they're downstairs.

197
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,160
Scott: Okay, so there's no real nice ones that you would want.

198
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,894
Rym: No, but there's bikes you could sell for like 700, 800 bucks.

199
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,060
Scott: I'm sure the building is going to take care of that.

200
00:09:28,343 --> 00:09:28,515
Rym: Yup.

201
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:33,099
Scott: The same way they take care of stuff when you leave your apartment and leave all your stuff in it and don't come back.

202
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:47,219
Rym: It's just interesting to me how many people own bikes in New York, who went through the effort to put them in the bike room in the building that has a bike room, and then have a slightly further away room.

203
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,219
Rym: I wonder what's going to happen when that deadline comes and goes and none of those people have moved their bikes.

204
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,099
Scott: I wonder what they're going to do with the room they're moving the bikes out of.

205
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,238
Rym: Probably just make it storage.

206
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,016
Scott: I don't know.

207
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:59,199
Rym: I mean downstairs, nothing but storage and boilers and stuff down there.

208
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,900
Scott: There used to be someone living down there.

209
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,240
Rym: There's also a whole bunch of scary industrial shit down there because it's a big building.

210
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10,860
Scott: Dude, the downstairs in my elementary school, it's like whenever I think of a downstairs that's scary- You want to compare downstairs scary elementary schools?

211
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:21,459
Rym: I went to an ancient elementary school with a Catholic church, like an old one, like one of the older ones in the US attached to it, with tunnels connecting them to each other and all this crazy shit.

212
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:26,140
Scott: There was a giant super bank safe in the bottom.

213
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,698
Rym: Ooh, that's where all the dead kids are.

214
00:10:30,404 --> 00:10:32,279
Scott: I went in it once or twice, I forget why.

215
00:10:34,221 --> 00:10:42,379
Rym: I remember once I was breaking into, I was bored at RIT and I was busting into the tunnels and then the sub tunnels and all the places you're not supposed to go.

216
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,340
Rym: Because RIT has tunnels everywhere, but there were tunnels under those tunnels.

217
00:10:46,780 --> 00:11:01,477
Rym: So I found a stairway that was always locked that went down from one of the sub tunnels and there was a tiny window and I could see that it went way down and it's already a full floor below the tunnel, which itself is like a floor and a half below ground.

218
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:02,759
Scott: So it was at the bottom.

219
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:18,440
Rym: So I opened the thing because it was just unlocked one day and I start creeping down and I get about halfway down and the doors kind of prop behind me and there's a little bit of light coming in and I realized I couldn't find any way to turn on any lights down there and there were scary noises coming from the bottom.

220
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:22,418
Rym: So I went back up and I resolved to come back with a flashlight and it was locked.

221
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:24,959
Rym: every time I checked again for the rest of my time at RIT.

222
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,077
Scott: Why don't you just unlock it?

223
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:26,807
Rym: How?

224
00:11:27,262 --> 00:11:27,980
Rym: I'm not a lock pick.

225
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,459
Scott: You could YouTube that shit.

226
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,319
Rym: Yeah, I guess I could have made a bump key, but I didn't care that much.

227
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,680
Scott: But actually, did YouTube exist?

228
00:11:34,241 --> 00:11:35,919
Rym: No, YouTube appeared while we were at RIT.

229
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,760
Scott: You still could have gotten eLockPicking things from the library.

230
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,520
Rym: In fact, the first videos we uploaded to YouTube, you can only upload 10 minutes at a time.

231
00:11:42,621 --> 00:11:44,739
Rym: So a lot of our early panels are in 10 minute chunks.

232
00:11:45,722 --> 00:11:46,659
Rym: That's how old we are.

233
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,939
Scott: But you could still go to the school library and get info.

234
00:11:49,861 --> 00:11:51,520
Rym: Oh yeah, go to the special collection?

235
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,959
Scott: I'm just any library.

236
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,260
Scott: Even a public library has a book on lock picking.

237
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:00,180
Scott: And if you don't have a book on lock picking, they have a book on locksmithing because you want to be a locksmith.

238
00:12:00,981 --> 00:12:04,440
Scott: And I'm sure at RIT, there are many kids who have practiced lock picking.

239
00:12:04,561 --> 00:12:05,258
Scott: You could find one.

240
00:12:06,021 --> 00:12:11,240
Rym: Anyway, it's anime day, and Monica in comics day, and we got to talk about that kind of stuff.

241
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:11,780
Rym: Do you got any news?

242
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,719
Scott: I do have a news.

243
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:27,459
Scott: So we're doing at Anime Boston, one of the panels we do there is the judge book anime by its cover, and we review one of the upcoming anime seasons, and the spring season is literally like about to start, and it had more interesting stuff, so I chose that one instead of the summer one for our panel.

244
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,558
Rym: I haven't looked at this at all.

245
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:47,299
Scott: Right, so one of the things on the list was, normally we're supposed to judge by the cover and not know anything about any of these shows, but there was one that I had seen the trailer for because someone posted it in our forum, and this show looks like it's going to be a great, terrific, amazing show that everyone should see.

246
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:49,920
Scott: So I can't judge it by its cover because I've seen this trailer.

247
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,580
Rym: Well that trailer is part of the cover, you know, because we talk about it in the panel.

248
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,179
Rym: Sometimes you do the Google image search.

249
00:12:56,182 --> 00:12:59,240
Scott: But anyway, this show is called Sakamoto Desuka.

250
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,597
Scott: It's about this kid named Sakamoto, and he is like Mr.

251
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,700
Scott: Perfect of school, basically, right?

252
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,620
Scott: Like everything he does is perfect.

253
00:13:08,201 --> 00:13:09,879
Scott: If you try to prank him, you can't.

254
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,780
Scott: He like gets good grades and he's super athletic and just like he's perfect at everything.

255
00:13:15,184 --> 00:13:16,759
Scott: He cannot be fucked with at all.

256
00:13:17,101 --> 00:13:25,260
Scott: Right, but he's also like so nice and it's just like he's like infuriatingly good at everything, but also awesomely good at everything.

257
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:31,540
Scott: The way that like One Punch Man or Go Go 13 or any of those people are just so good and being badass and always winning.

258
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:35,040
Rym: I'm always a fan of the infuriatingly good protagonist genre.

259
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:45,879
Scott: Yeah, so it's also well animated, so it's, you know, it's like, well, you know, it's not super well animated like Ghibli level, but it's like better animated than the closest equivalent we can think of.

260
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,240
Scott: It's not a modern animation.

261
00:13:48,822 --> 00:13:49,700
Scott: It is modern animation.

262
00:13:49,761 --> 00:13:50,499
Scott: It's not some garbage.

263
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:55,520
Scott: So this show is the show to watch in the spring season.

264
00:13:56,504 --> 00:13:57,900
Scott: We'll see what happens in the summer season.

265
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,440
Rym: So Escaflowne now, so many people emailed me about this.

266
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,226
Scott: That's your show.

267
00:14:03,287 --> 00:14:04,559
Rym: Read it at me about this.

268
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,203
Scott: That's your thing.

269
00:14:05,224 --> 00:14:07,380
Rym: I haven't talked to in four or five years.

270
00:14:08,044 --> 00:14:10,080
Scott: I mean, your Twitter handle is Shazar.

271
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:10,903
Rym: That is true.

272
00:14:10,923 --> 00:14:13,600
Rym: Named after Cliff Shazar from Trigon.

273
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,960
Scott: No, not named after Cliff Shazar from Trigon.

274
00:14:17,382 --> 00:14:19,260
Rym: That is the other anime Shazar though.

275
00:14:19,682 --> 00:14:19,984
Scott: Sure.

276
00:14:20,587 --> 00:14:23,040
Scott: You had that name, though, before Trigon was even a thing.

277
00:14:23,723 --> 00:14:24,939
Rym: That is, in fact, true.

278
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:31,640
Rym: But because of Alan Shazar, who is in Escaflowne and also kind of a not great person.

279
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:45,580
Scott: If you watch the show is exactly like Rym, but Escaflowne was intentionally made his own life and he manually crafted his own personality to be a combination of Captain Tyler and Shazar on purpose.

280
00:14:46,361 --> 00:14:48,148
Rym: It's more like 90 percent.

281
00:14:48,249 --> 00:14:50,820
Rym: Tyler is mostly Tyler.

282
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,618
Scott: That's what you like to think.

283
00:14:51,821 --> 00:14:52,940
Rym: Yeah, I don't know.

284
00:14:53,161 --> 00:14:54,855
Rym: I never really learned how to use swords.

285
00:14:54,896 --> 00:14:55,339
Rym: that well.

286
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:57,200
Scott: You had more.

287
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,500
Scott: You're lucky that you didn't have money.

288
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,400
Scott: But that is the right time.

289
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,620
Rym: I would have Alex's fucking sword hanging around somewhere.

290
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:06,425
Rym: It's real good.

291
00:15:06,445 --> 00:15:11,180
Rym: I never got into the wheel of time when I was young and had money because there's a lot of replicas of all the things in that.

292
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,105
Scott: Well, no, that would have been good.

293
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:16,854
Scott: You would have spent your money on books and not on some garbage for like 300 bucks.

294
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,320
Rym: You get the Heron blade.

295
00:15:19,282 --> 00:15:19,826
Scott: Yeah, sure.

296
00:15:19,867 --> 00:15:21,460
Rym: It was always in the museum replicas catalog.

297
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,360
Rym: And I always look at it and be like, whoa, that's a really cool.

298
00:15:23,602 --> 00:15:24,639
Scott: So you can have all the Heron.

299
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:27,960
Rym: But it's got a full tang, Scott, a full tang.

300
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,199
Rym: It's battle worthy.

301
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:34,060
Scott: Rym, you can have the Heron blade if I have Kalindar Heron spear.

302
00:15:34,505 --> 00:15:34,750
Rym: All right.

303
00:15:34,914 --> 00:15:35,200
Rym: You know what?

304
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:35,959
Rym: You have the Heron spear.

305
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,999
Rym: I'll take oh, what is it?

306
00:15:38,261 --> 00:15:41,180
Rym: The song real nonsense that they use those giant statues.

307
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,400
Scott: You're not beating my Heron spear.

308
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:44,420
Rym: I think those statues beat the Heron spear.

309
00:15:44,681 --> 00:15:49,360
Scott: Heron spear is just some like Heron spear can destroy the no god.

310
00:15:49,641 --> 00:15:50,860
Scott: Not you know what I can't.

311
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,686
Rym: It's so powerful.

312
00:15:51,726 --> 00:15:53,740
Scott: Not only can destroy God, just like whatever.

313
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,098
Scott: It can destroy the absence of gods.

314
00:15:58,326 --> 00:15:59,039
Rym: That book's coming.

315
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,959
Scott: But giant tornado with a scary coffin in the middle.

316
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:06,460
Rym: Escaflowne was one of the anime that I like, you know, I was in high school.

317
00:16:06,601 --> 00:16:09,279
Rym: I was really into anime since I was like eight years old.

318
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:17,320
Rym: But Escaflowne was an anime that I was aware of when it was in Japan and was desperately trying to see for a long time.

319
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,499
Rym: And then when it got released in the U.S.

320
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,800
Rym: on VHS, I basically watched it as fast as I possibly could.

321
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:31,240
Rym: I tried to get fansubs and actually failed because the people who were fansubbing it wouldn't distribute it to me because I didn't run an anime club.

322
00:16:32,322 --> 00:16:35,200
Rym: And they didn't believe me when I lied and said that I did run an anime.

323
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,920
Scott: But you did eventually run an anime club.

324
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,480
Rym: Yeah, fuck you guys who fansub Escaflowne.

325
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,700
Scott: But anyway, it I didn't realize until just now.

326
00:16:43,781 --> 00:16:45,420
Scott: Escaflowne had never been dubbed.

327
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,660
Scott: We had a VHS set that was all subs.

328
00:16:48,021 --> 00:16:51,559
Scott: I thought that there was a set you could have gotten with dubs and we were just smart enough not to buy that.

329
00:16:51,841 --> 00:16:52,854
Rym: But no, there was also subtitles.

330
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,460
Scott: There was also a DVD box set that I believed had dub on it and it did not.

331
00:16:57,842 --> 00:16:58,999
Scott: And there was a dub on Fox.

332
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,219
Scott: But that's not Escaflowne.

333
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,960
Rym: The dub and that's not even complete.

334
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:08,500
Rym: The Fox box or whatever dub basically cut the show up and kind of gave it the Warriors of the Wind treatment.

335
00:17:09,101 --> 00:17:11,839
Rym: I'm not even sure if they finished dubbing the entire show.

336
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,380
Rym: But that dub was a disaster.

337
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,999
Scott: It's also not Escaflowne basically.

338
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,020
Rym: Yeah, it's Warriors of the Wind 2.

339
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:17,363
Scott: It's like it's.

340
00:17:17,585 --> 00:17:19,339
Scott: I mean, people want to talk about Macross.

341
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,457
Scott: I mean, Robotech isn't Macross, which it isn't.

342
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,499
Scott: But really, the Escaflowne on Fox is even worse than that.

343
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,860
Rym: But Escaflowne is actually one of my favorite anime.

344
00:17:29,981 --> 00:17:31,479
Rym: And it is a really good show.

345
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,915
Rym: There aren't shows like it.

346
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,580
Rym: Partly because there's a lot of reasons.

347
00:17:35,141 --> 00:17:35,680
Scott: Isaac Newton spoilers.

348
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:43,520
Rym: I feel like I should watch it again because I don't know if it warrants its high placement on my list of my favorite anime ever.

349
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,913
Scott: It's no Evangelion.

350
00:17:44,994 --> 00:17:45,439
Rym: No, it's not.

351
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,699
Rym: Of course, it's not an Evangelion, but it's a good show.

352
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,740
Scott: Why not watch it?

353
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,139
Scott: It's better than like almost all the shows coming out right now.

354
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:51,722
Rym: Yeah.

355
00:17:52,124 --> 00:17:54,718
Rym: I mean, if it came out today, it's got new.

356
00:17:55,442 --> 00:17:56,460
Rym: It would do really well.

357
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,678
Rym: I think it's got those musics.

358
00:17:58,324 --> 00:17:59,360
Rym: It moves real fast.

359
00:17:59,782 --> 00:18:00,752
Scott: It's got good characters.

360
00:18:00,772 --> 00:18:01,580
Scott: It's got cliffhangers.

361
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,880
Rym: This is where I think Maya Sakamoto basically got her start.

362
00:18:05,121 --> 00:18:10,500
Rym: This is where this is where a lot of people got like their sort of starts in anime.

363
00:18:11,681 --> 00:18:14,857
Rym: So the dubs coming on Kickstarter there.

364
00:18:15,742 --> 00:18:17,240
Scott: So why would you kickstart a dub?

365
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:20,320
Scott: You could just buy the DVD box set that's legally available with subs.

366
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:24,620
Scott: Why would you pay more money than that to help them make a dub that we don't?

367
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,103
Scott: World does not.

368
00:18:25,124 --> 00:18:26,640
Rym: That is, in fact, what I don't get.

369
00:18:26,781 --> 00:18:33,910
Rym: Now, I could see them making a dub if they were going to try to do what I always say they should do and give you might.

370
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:39,199
Scott: you might be a blind person who does not know Japanese, in which case this dub would be very good for you.

371
00:18:39,662 --> 00:18:40,238
Rym: That is true.

372
00:18:40,981 --> 00:18:42,919
Scott: But other than that, why do you want this?

373
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:54,459
Rym: Yeah, because if I were like if I had the rights to the show, you'd only dub it if you were going to put it on like Crunchyroll or Hulu or whatever and then promote it and try to get Normies to watch it like or you're going to put it on TV.

374
00:18:54,841 --> 00:18:59,480
Rym: You're going to do something with it for a like not insider anime audience.

375
00:18:59,983 --> 00:19:09,000
Rym: But the people who are going to preorder this are almost entirely people who know the show exists and have already seen it probably several times.

376
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,337
Scott: Why do they want to see it again with English language?

377
00:19:11,801 --> 00:19:16,600
Rym: There's no evidence that it's going to be a better dub than any average anime dub is.

378
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,820
Rym: And I feel like this is just a preorder for it.

379
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,559
Rym: I don't need to feel like because they say straight up.

380
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,189
Rym: This is just a preorder because obviously one hundred and fifty grand is not enough to dub a show, right?

381
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:34,580
Rym: I mean, one hundred fifty grand is maybe enough to dub one episode of a show if you do it low rent.

382
00:19:35,501 --> 00:19:36,306
Rym: But that's not.

383
00:19:36,326 --> 00:19:38,820
Scott: they seem to be doing it at the usual rent level.

384
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,585
Rym: Yeah.

385
00:19:40,605 --> 00:19:47,715
Rym: So they pretty much straight up are like, yeah, this is just a pre preorder for all of you who want this and that'll make.

386
00:19:47,816 --> 00:19:51,400
Rym: we'll only do the dub if we know there's enough interest because this is a preorder.

387
00:19:51,803 --> 00:19:58,939
Rym: So they're basically saying we're going to pay to dub it, but only if a bunch of you actually commit with money to buy it once we release it.

388
00:19:59,941 --> 00:20:03,698
Rym: But I think the actual reason people are excited about this, they don't.

389
00:20:03,819 --> 00:20:11,700
Rym: I don't think any of these people care about the dub because the five thousand dollar tier is gone, the four hundred dollar tier is gone.

390
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,094
Scott: What do you get?

391
00:20:13,101 --> 00:20:14,379
Scott: Is five thousand the highest tier?

392
00:20:14,905 --> 00:20:15,210
Rym: Oh, yes.

393
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:15,779
Rym: What do you get?

394
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:17,960
Rym: OK, the star.

395
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,358
Rym: They're all named after tarot cards.

396
00:20:20,061 --> 00:20:26,339
Rym: Yeah, a one of a kind Escaflowne experience will fly you out to the Funimation office where you'll get a tour.

397
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,519
Scott: No one wants to do that.

398
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:33,699
Rym: A bag of Funimation goodies, garbage, and you'll get to do voice work that will appear in the dub.

399
00:20:34,363 --> 00:20:35,740
Rym: So you're going to do some random background.

400
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:41,080
Rym: You're going to be that guy in that awful Gasaraki dub who says, what's wrong, you sure?

401
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:46,459
Scott: Oh, you're going to be like some knight that gets stabbed and goes, oh, I'll bet you'll get to say a word.

402
00:20:46,641 --> 00:20:49,220
Rym: And it's going to because you remember that guy in Gasaraki, right?

403
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,140
Scott: It's going to be some guy gets cut down by fun or something.

404
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,391
Rym: You remember that guy in Gasaraki?

405
00:20:52,411 --> 00:20:53,239
Scott: Yeah, I remember that guy.

406
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,060
Rym: That guy stands out like a wound to this day in my soul.

407
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:01,380
Rym: We want to go get everything in the lower tiers.

408
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:12,240
Rym: So the four hundred, three hundred, two hundred dollar tiers, which are pretty much like all crazy subscribed, are basically just giant boxes of nonsense for the show.

409
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,288
Rym: Nothing about the dub.

410
00:21:13,389 --> 00:21:14,479
Scott: Who needs any of this garbage?

411
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,026
Rym: Collectors, people who want the perfect edition of Escaflowne.

412
00:21:17,046 --> 00:21:18,700
Scott: I didn't think there were this many collectors.

413
00:21:19,181 --> 00:21:21,999
Rym: These are the people who are who, like me, were obsessed with Escaflowne.

414
00:21:22,441 --> 00:21:27,080
Rym: But unlike me, still want to spend a lot of money on getting things like a poster signed.

415
00:21:27,442 --> 00:21:30,520
Scott: The existing DVD box here for four hundred bucks.

416
00:21:30,941 --> 00:21:39,720
Rym: You get the box set with all the fancy art and stuff and you get a poster signed by the director, the original creator and the character designer.

417
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,544
Rym: Nobutaru Yuki.

418
00:21:40,765 --> 00:21:43,540
Scott: OK, but I mean, I saw Nobutaru Yuki at Otakon.

419
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,022
Rym: Yeah.

420
00:21:44,246 --> 00:21:45,060
Rym: So you basically.

421
00:21:45,441 --> 00:21:48,940
Scott: So why do I need a thing that he wrote on to get their signatures?

422
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:49,939
Rym: And it's that kind of crap.

423
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:53,600
Rym: It's the dub doesn't even need to be a part of this.

424
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:58,620
Rym: I'll bet if they just said Escaflowne re-released without a dub, they would have raised almost the exact same amount of money.

425
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,247
Rym: So maybe they're going to.

426
00:22:01,267 --> 00:22:06,320
Rym: they're doing the dub just because they're going to get the interest from this and it'll sort of break even.

427
00:22:06,461 --> 00:22:09,060
Rym: And then they're going to try to push Escaflowne to the mainstream audience.

428
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:18,080
Scott: Maybe it's just the anime voice actors like kind of upset because there's less dubs lately because everything is going pretty much straight to the Internet streaming with subtitles.

429
00:22:18,221 --> 00:22:21,739
Scott: And they're like, let's you know, we want to make money doing this again.

430
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:26,460
Rym: Except most anime voice actors who are good also just do voiceover work and they're great.

431
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,717
Rym: And that other work, they're only bad in anime dubs.

432
00:22:29,803 --> 00:22:30,490
Rym: I mean, they're not.

433
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,460
Rym: they're not hurting for though.

434
00:22:32,021 --> 00:22:41,318
Rym: Actually, I've seen a few voice actors we know who are friends with me on LinkedIn in the last year updating their statuses to things to the effect of, yeah, I really would like some work.

435
00:22:43,883 --> 00:22:44,638
Rym: So we'll see.

436
00:22:44,941 --> 00:22:48,479
Rym: I don't think there's any reason to back this unless I mean, if I was going to.

437
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:53,280
Scott: We should find something that like no one will ever dub ever and dub it.

438
00:22:53,962 --> 00:23:01,617
Scott: Just like as best we actually try as best as we can ourselves, which is to offend us, saying it's got to offend us, people we know, right?

439
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,820
Scott: Just do the best that we can do, which is not that great.

440
00:23:04,941 --> 00:23:07,396
Scott: But just do the best we can do honestly and see what happens.

441
00:23:08,224 --> 00:23:09,319
Scott: Yes, I'm like Zazen Jotaro.

442
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,249
Scott: It's not bad.

443
00:23:10,695 --> 00:23:11,080
Rym: Well, wait.

444
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:13,499
Rym: Most of these low tiers don't even get you Escaflowne.

445
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:17,400
Scott: How much do you have to pay to actually get the DVD box set of the full series?

446
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,260
Rym: Fifteen bucks just gets you a certificate.

447
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,720
Rym: Thirty bucks gets you a preorder of the movie.

448
00:23:23,203 --> 00:23:25,980
Scott: Oh, I was about to ask if you get the movie and any of these tiers.

449
00:23:26,581 --> 00:23:27,026
Rym: Thirty five.

450
00:23:27,046 --> 00:23:28,379
Scott: Are they dubbing the movie too?

451
00:23:29,405 --> 00:23:30,258
Rym: I assume so.

452
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,280
Scott: So they're going to dub the movie and the TV show.

453
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,400
Scott: That makes me kind of okay.

454
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:39,160
Rym: For sixty five dollars, you get all that nonsense above.

455
00:23:39,522 --> 00:23:45,040
Rym: You get a preorder of the Escaflowne TV series, part one featuring episodes one through thirteen.

456
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:45,866
Rym: Fuck you.

457
00:23:45,886 --> 00:23:45,968
Rym: Yeah.

458
00:23:47,361 --> 00:23:50,019
Scott: This Kickstarter, that's the biggest rip off I ever heard.

459
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:50,645
Scott: Yeah.

460
00:23:50,706 --> 00:23:51,359
Scott: The whole box.

461
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:54,339
Scott: How much is the whole box set on Amazon, the one that we already have?

462
00:23:54,741 --> 00:23:55,487
Rym: I don't even know.

463
00:23:55,829 --> 00:23:56,938
Scott: I'm going to go look right now.

464
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,780
Rym: But so it's interesting.

465
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:14,339
Rym: Well, Scott's looking that up because I had to make a new version of foreign anime openers because, you know, I want to have two hours of material so I can do the panel with different audiences, even though you people keep coming to it and watching the same Captain Harlock thing over and over and over again.

466
00:24:15,281 --> 00:24:29,326
Rym: It's real hard to find foreign anime openers because even pretty much everywhere in the world, except for Russia and Korea, they just use the Japanese songs and they just subtitled stuff because no one cares anymore.

467
00:24:29,346 --> 00:24:30,459
Scott: Oh, look at that.

468
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:30,761
Scott: Okay.

469
00:24:30,781 --> 00:24:33,100
Scott: So, Rym, do you still have that Escaflowne DVD box?

470
00:24:33,561 --> 00:24:36,060
Rym: Actually, for various reasons, I have two of them.

471
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:36,641
Scott: All right.

472
00:24:36,701 --> 00:24:38,912
Scott: But so on Amazon, it's one of the.

473
00:24:39,253 --> 00:24:42,051
Scott: it turns out it's one of those things that they didn't make that many.

474
00:24:42,092 --> 00:24:42,959
Rym: And now it's rare that.

475
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:43,401
Scott: Yeah.

476
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:44,566
Scott: So they're selling.

477
00:24:44,646 --> 00:24:47,580
Scott: I mean, they're being priced on Amazon at one fifty.

478
00:24:48,124 --> 00:24:50,300
Scott: But no one seems to be buying at one fifty.

479
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,575
Scott: But I'm sure if you put it up at one hundred, maybe someone would buy or even seventy five.

480
00:24:54,636 --> 00:24:54,820
Scott: Right.

481
00:24:55,282 --> 00:24:57,560
Rym: Thing is for one hundred and twenty five.

482
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:57,925
Rym: Oh, no.

483
00:24:58,047 --> 00:24:58,660
Rym: One hundred twenty five.

484
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,780
Rym: You still only get part one and part two.

485
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:06,600
Rym: OK, so you have to pay one hundred and twenty five bucks to actually get Escaflowne in this preorder.

486
00:25:07,024 --> 00:25:08,159
Rym: And that is a limited tier.

487
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,798
Rym: There's only five hundred of those.

488
00:25:10,702 --> 00:25:12,700
Scott: But I have a feeling we go to anime Boston.

489
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:16,260
Scott: We'll be able to find this box that cheap if we see it here on eBay.

490
00:25:16,421 --> 00:25:18,980
Scott: It looks like a legit ones on eBay.

491
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,839
Scott: You know, it could be bootleg ones that just stole the art from the legit ones.

492
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,480
Scott: But these look like legit ones to me selling for twenty on eBay.

493
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,282
Rym: All right.

494
00:25:27,302 --> 00:25:27,625
Rym: All right.

495
00:25:27,645 --> 00:25:29,760
Rym: So there's no reason to buy it at anime Boston.

496
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:33,159
Scott: This is Escaflowne a complete collection, eight, this set brand new.

497
00:25:33,681 --> 00:25:38,560
Scott: The image in the picture here looks like it's the image from the real thing.

498
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,079
Scott: It could be so bootleg, though.

499
00:25:40,721 --> 00:25:42,660
Rym: So I did a control F on the Kickstarter.

500
00:25:43,081 --> 00:25:44,600
Rym: The word remaster doesn't appear anywhere.

501
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:48,940
Rym: So I don't think you get any thing beyond that.

502
00:25:49,261 --> 00:25:50,474
Rym: I mean, they're saying HD.

503
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,539
Rym: Pretty sure it's just DVDs.

504
00:25:53,600 --> 00:26:00,440
Scott: Here's one that's definitely legit because it's the box with the lid that comes with the robot and stuff and either even showing the DVD cases spread out.

505
00:26:00,641 --> 00:26:03,519
Scott: And it's definitely been watched and they're selling it for seventy five.

506
00:26:04,081 --> 00:26:05,280
Scott: So whatever.

507
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:18,383
Rym: Yeah, no, I'm so I'm excited that this might cause a renaissance of Escaflowne watching because I think a lot of kids who watch anime today, their minds would be blown by this show because there aren't a lot of shows like it.

508
00:26:18,564 --> 00:26:20,736
Scott: Well, there's not a lot of fantasy adventure.

509
00:26:20,776 --> 00:26:24,372
Scott: that's somewhat serious, but there's plenty of main character.

510
00:26:24,452 --> 00:26:26,320
Scott: magical girl goes to another the universe.

511
00:26:26,881 --> 00:26:33,740
Rym: Yeah, but like full on high fantasy, like all the slayers kind of stuff, but actually serious and not just no comedy.

512
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,020
Scott: Escaflowne exit the cat girl for like five minutes.

513
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,158
Rym: There's comedy at times.

514
00:26:37,421 --> 00:26:38,165
Rym: Yeah, it's just it.

515
00:26:38,206 --> 00:26:40,560
Rym: definitely not like the comedy gets shed away.

516
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:43,820
Rym: Yeah, El Hazzard is about 40 percent comedy overall.

517
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,819
Scott: El Hazzard is Escaflowne plus a lot more lols.

518
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:49,120
Rym: Yeah, and a lot more weird fan service.

519
00:26:49,402 --> 00:26:49,819
Rym: Cat armor.

520
00:26:50,841 --> 00:26:51,816
Rym: Cat armor is great.

521
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,239
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

522
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,820
Rym: So, Scott, have you ever wondered why we have butt hair?

523
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,980
Scott: You mean hair on your butt or hair in the crack?

524
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:07,765
Rym: In the crack.

525
00:27:07,805 --> 00:27:09,400
Rym: Like you ever wonder why there's hair in there?

526
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,980
Scott: Because there's more hair there than everywhere else.

527
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:16,740
Scott: I've heard stories of people removing that hair and then having a butt that gets sealed shut and is a disgusting result.

528
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:23,056
Rym: Ah, you were thinking of the story that I remember that we learned about at RIT, the pass out and vomit story from the yes.

529
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:36,380
Rym: So someone apparently in the Crash Course videos and SciShow and all that has when they have a they have a one punch man avatar and they ask anyone of the one punch man avatar they posted legit.

530
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:43,820
Scott: So someone today with a one with a Saitama avatar posted the images of what's almost definitely pretty legit.

531
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,500
Scott: The Nintendo NX controller.

532
00:27:46,605 --> 00:27:48,720
Scott: You can always trust Saitama avatar.

533
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,600
Scott: So that is the only anime anime.

534
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:53,980
Scott: It's like the exception to anime avatars, not all anime avatars.

535
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:58,640
Scott: Saitama avatars are like the exact opposite of all anime avatars.

536
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:02,875
Scott: If someone has one, they're basically just follow them because whatever they say is great.

537
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:13,100
Rym: Lido Johnny with the Saitama avatar has posted a comment that gets upvoted a lot on every single video they have ever uploaded asking quotes in all caps.

538
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,980
Rym: Why is there hair on my anus?

539
00:28:16,301 --> 00:28:20,480
Rym: So they decided to do a special and they answered that question.

540
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,639
Rym: So the do you want to know the answer?

541
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,279
Rym: Scientists don't know.

542
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,318
Rym: It's actually a mystery.

543
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:27,218
Rym: What?

544
00:28:27,501 --> 00:28:28,137
Rym: No, for real.

545
00:28:28,622 --> 00:28:29,360
Rym: There are some theories.

546
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,633
Scott: I mean, it's just right now.

547
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,120
Scott: Yeah, it is just not to be a reason.

548
00:28:33,661 --> 00:28:37,680
Scott: Well, yeah, but the reason because people kept screwing people who had butt hair.

549
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:37,743
Rym: No.

550
00:28:38,081 --> 00:28:39,440
Rym: So they're the butt hair.

551
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:43,060
Scott: Maybe you had butt hair or not didn't affect whether people made babies with you.

552
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,040
Scott: So some people, you know, it might have.

553
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:50,500
Rym: So actually what they come up with in the videos, one, they talk about all the theories and also didn't affect whether you lived or died.

554
00:28:50,761 --> 00:28:54,460
Rym: So one that I could add long, long enough to screw and actually may have.

555
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:59,819
Rym: So one of the theories has to do with there was no evolutionary pressure for hair there to go away.

556
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,600
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

557
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,579
Rym: But hair went away everywhere else.

558
00:29:03,044 --> 00:29:04,219
Rym: So why not there?

559
00:29:05,563 --> 00:29:08,040
Rym: It's not tied to pubic hair, secondary sex or anything.

560
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:08,860
Rym: It's completely independent.

561
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,858
Scott: Hair didn't necessarily go everywhere else.

562
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:11,757
Rym: Well, man.

563
00:29:14,843 --> 00:29:16,439
Scott: Exhibit A, Scott Johnson.

564
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:20,860
Rym: Did you see the font someone made that is pictures of their shoulder hairs?

565
00:29:21,243 --> 00:29:22,060
Scott: I got shoulder hairs.

566
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:26,220
Rym: It's pictures of individual shoulder hairs on their body that form the shapes of letters.

567
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,199
Rym: It's a font you can use.

568
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,040
Rym: It's horrific.

569
00:29:28,741 --> 00:29:30,019
Scott: Oh, I don't have that.

570
00:29:30,781 --> 00:29:31,839
Rym: You don't have words up there?

571
00:29:32,068 --> 00:29:32,196
Rym: No.

572
00:29:32,822 --> 00:29:38,879
Rym: One of the theories involves that without hair there, you'll have warm, moist skin rubbing against warm, moist skin.

573
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:44,140
Rym: And it implies that that story we read at RIT might be a legitimate concern.

574
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,599
Scott: Yeah, I totally believe that.

575
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,699
Rym: But there's no evidence of that.

576
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,720
Scott: Well, at Rym you're just going to self-experiment.

577
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:54,060
Rym: So he proposes at the end of the video an experiment that would determine.

578
00:29:54,520 --> 00:30:09,080
Rym: And apparently getting rid of the hair down there and forcing someone to see is not a valid experiment because the shaving or, quote, whatever method you use to remove the hair is equally likely to be the source of irritation.

579
00:30:10,662 --> 00:30:13,820
Scott: So this video, if you wax your butt, that's going to be pretty irritating.

580
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:14,387
Rym: Yeah.

581
00:30:15,762 --> 00:30:21,358
Rym: So this video goes into the science of why we don't actually know why there's hair in our butt.

582
00:30:21,661 --> 00:30:23,180
Scott: You can also put Nair in your butt.

583
00:30:24,325 --> 00:30:27,400
Rym: No, I will never let Nair touch my body in my entire life.

584
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,040
Scott: I'm going to take some Nair and throw it at you.

585
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:29,659
Rym: No, you're not.

586
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:34,900
Scott: Fun fact, I'll just slip some onto your keyboard and be like typing and be like, there is a I have my fingers.

587
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,400
Rym: A lot of men in America at least get injured by Nair.

588
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:40,258
Scott: What?

589
00:30:41,042 --> 00:30:42,739
Scott: And it's because why are they touching it?

590
00:30:43,102 --> 00:30:45,340
Rym: They use it for, you know, balls or whatever.

591
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:55,400
Rym: No, but they being stupid assume that man branded Nair is stronger than woman branded Nair.

592
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,520
Scott: It's the same shit in a different bottle.

593
00:30:56,681 --> 00:30:57,017
Rym: No, it's not.

594
00:30:57,261 --> 00:31:00,540
Rym: So they buy female branded Nair and use that.

595
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:09,260
Rym: But on average, Nair that is made for a woman to use for the kinds of places that women use it is actually way stronger than what they make for men.

596
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,120
Rym: I mean, I know that men are little babies.

597
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:14,600
Scott: In high school, I knew kids who put like Icy Hot on their nuts.

598
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:14,708
Scott: Right.

599
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,960
Rym: So that's that's a yeah, whatever.

600
00:31:17,362 --> 00:31:18,280
Rym: I'm not touching Nair.

601
00:31:18,742 --> 00:31:19,920
Scott: That's high school level material.

602
00:31:20,561 --> 00:31:25,560
Rym: Actually, I wonder if we'll find out more about Nair's child in the upcoming Nair.

603
00:31:26,782 --> 00:31:32,600
Scott: Anyway, so for anyone who doesn't know, Nair is like this hair removal cream that burns your hairs off, basically.

604
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:36,260
Scott: Anyway, so you've heard the phrase like milk toast, right?

605
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,397
Scott: It's like milk toast is like usually an insult to someone because they're so boring and plain.

606
00:31:40,708 --> 00:31:40,879
Rym: Yeah.

607
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:46,499
Rym: I mean, if you think and basic, if I imagine the word milk toast, I imagine a perfect picture of Milhouse Van Houten.

608
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,256
Scott: Yeah, but milk bread, milk toast is actually a real thing.

609
00:31:50,276 --> 00:31:50,919
Scott: that is delicious.

610
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,860
Scott: You'll often buy it at the Japanese bakery or whatever.

611
00:31:54,304 --> 00:31:56,139
Scott: Yeah, but how do you make that?

612
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,417
Scott: How do they make that?

613
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:07,219
Scott: Apparently, in order to make that and the reason it's not really a thing in most countries is because you need an ingredient that I don't even know the real name of.

614
00:32:07,582 --> 00:32:09,099
Scott: It's known as bread improver.

615
00:32:09,881 --> 00:32:10,438
Rym: Bread improver.

616
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,140
Scott: That's right.

617
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:11,815
Scott: So you can get...

618
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,419
Rym: That sounds ominous.

619
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:16,296
Scott: If I would say in Japan, I could just go to the grocery store and buy some bread improver.

620
00:32:17,061 --> 00:32:20,540
Scott: But in the United States, it's not so easy to get bread improver.

621
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,120
Rym: Whole grain bread improver from King Arthur Flour.

622
00:32:23,304 --> 00:32:23,918
Scott: Oh, how about that?

623
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:24,917
Scott: There you go.

624
00:32:25,583 --> 00:32:26,579
Rym: It looks like it's just flour.

625
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:27,879
Scott: Yeah, who knows?

626
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,600
Scott: But anyway, if you can't get the bread improver, because it's not like the grocery store.

627
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,540
Scott: Find me a grocery store that actually has that, right?

628
00:32:35,581 --> 00:32:37,500
Scott: They don't have it a stop and shop.

629
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:38,680
Rym: I'm going to check my fresh direct.

630
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:44,199
Scott: OK, but anyway, if you can't get the bread improver, which you probably can't unless you buy it on the Internet or something, right?

631
00:32:44,881 --> 00:32:47,000
Scott: What do you do if you want to make some some milk bread?

632
00:32:47,401 --> 00:32:52,720
Scott: So there's this Chinese lady and she has a website, Christine's Recipes.

633
00:32:53,702 --> 00:32:59,838
Scott: And here's this other website, Kirby's Cravings, who made Christine's recipe for the milk bread.

634
00:33:00,382 --> 00:33:07,460
Scott: And apparently the secret thing that they do is they use something known as the Tang Zong method, which I probably pronounced wrong because it's a Chinese word.

635
00:33:08,281 --> 00:33:24,560
Scott: And in this method, you basically sort of take some flour and some water and like you warm it up and like you cook it like sixty five Celsius to basically make this other stuff, this Tang Zong, this like flour paste, huh?

636
00:33:24,881 --> 00:33:32,320
Scott: And then you use that instead of using bread improver or any kind of preservatives or fluffing agents or anything like that.

637
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,077
Rym: It's got to get on it.

638
00:33:34,201 --> 00:33:41,660
Scott: Maybe it's it's work, but you can make what looks appears visually in these photographs to be delicious milk bread.

639
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,660
Rym: Watch it's a trap.

640
00:33:42,721 --> 00:33:45,020
Rym: It's like the anarchist cookbook, fake recipes for bombs.

641
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,859
Rym: It just makes like terrible bread.

642
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,119
Scott: If warming up flour in a pot is going to make a bomb.

643
00:33:50,643 --> 00:33:53,680
Scott: Oh, that's a problem in the moment.

644
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:59,680
Rym: The next book club book will be Margaret Edwards, Oryx and Crake, because I'm going to pause the Wheel of Time books at the end.

645
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,920
Scott: You can't pause the Wheel of Time.

646
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,748
Scott: It's never ending because it's in the third age.

647
00:34:06,065 --> 00:34:07,020
Rym: So it's a Wheel of Time.

648
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:07,820
Scott: It's a Wheel of Time.

649
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:08,277
Scott: Not easy.

650
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,179
Scott: It's not the line of time that has a beginning and an end.

651
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,839
Scott: It's not the line segment of time.

652
00:34:13,022 --> 00:34:13,699
Rym: Yeah, the wheel.

653
00:34:13,981 --> 00:34:22,818
Rym: There are so many characters that hit a point where there is a name of one of the And then that as to die ended up in a conversation that involved another.

654
00:34:22,898 --> 00:34:29,543
Rym: as to die that I thought for most of the previous four books were the same person because their names are.

655
00:34:29,583 --> 00:34:33,540
Rym: they differ by one letter and they just never been in the same area before.

656
00:34:34,404 --> 00:34:35,500
Rym: And they're very different.

657
00:34:35,723 --> 00:34:36,938
Rym: And I didn't realize that.

658
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:41,000
Rym: I just thought I just thought this one wizard was really erratic in her behavior.

659
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:45,239
Rym: OK, so we're going to be at Anime Boston this weekend.

660
00:34:45,703 --> 00:34:47,820
Rym: On Friday, role playing anime.

661
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:56,300
Rym: We're going to talk about what role playing systems to use if you want to role play anime, because I'll tell you what, the anime branded role playing systems are hot garbage.

662
00:34:57,241 --> 00:34:59,260
Rym: Judge anime by its covers Friday night.

663
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,060
Rym: That's the main event.

664
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:03,600
Rym: That's our like big ass anime Boston tradition.

665
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:06,160
Rym: We do this every year and it will not disappoint.

666
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,799
Scott: Is this the third or fourth time we've done this?

667
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:12,204
Rym: Yeah, we do it every year since that first year in 2013.

668
00:35:12,204 --> 00:35:13,358
Rym: And we're going to keep doing it every year.

669
00:35:14,361 --> 00:35:21,480
Rym: Saturday, how to run an anime club more for an anime openers, which is almost all new content and a motivational anime.

670
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:27,480
Rym: We're talking about like, you know, a pedal and why it pumps you up to bike the weekend right after that at Zank icon.

671
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,259
Rym: I will be there.

672
00:35:28,441 --> 00:35:29,059
Rym: Scott will not.

673
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:33,198
Rym: And on Saturday, I'm doing how to run an anime club with the other Scotts.

674
00:35:33,721 --> 00:35:37,780
Rym: I'm doing analyzing anime utenna because that's a good crowd for that kind of panel.

675
00:35:38,363 --> 00:35:40,439
Rym: And I'm doing practical game theory.

676
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:42,005
Rym: Yeah.

677
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:43,420
Rym: Got anything else?

678
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,379
Rym: We'd talk about not really ourselves on the Internet.

679
00:35:46,641 --> 00:35:49,960
Scott: Go go on the Internet and look at our things that we make besides this.

680
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:54,882
Rym: Like we have YouTube channels and Twitter's and Patreon's going strong and real close to that goal.

681
00:35:56,085 --> 00:36:01,647
Rym: Five people have revealed that they found several of the beta episodes of GeekNights.

682
00:36:01,729 --> 00:36:02,360
Rym: It's not hard.

683
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,920
Scott: People are just trying harder recently.

684
00:36:04,161 --> 00:36:06,680
Rym: So it was explaining to me how the most recent person found it.

685
00:36:07,023 --> 00:36:08,660
Rym: And basically it was typing too fast.

686
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:13,460
Rym: Hit enter before they finished typing something in a in a browser bar and it hit one.

687
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,405
Rym: He was like, what?

688
00:36:14,425 --> 00:36:17,100
Scott: Oh, it's not hard.

689
00:36:17,662 --> 00:36:19,309
Scott: It's just guessing URLs with.

690
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,699
Scott: they're not like obfuscated in any way.

691
00:36:21,961 --> 00:36:22,222
Rym: Yeah.

692
00:36:22,563 --> 00:36:26,620
Rym: But that no one appears to have found all of them.

693
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:37,614
Scott: But I'm actually not sure if all of them are actually still on the Internet because all the ones that we shared with our friends only in that PHP back in 2005 are on the Internet.

694
00:36:40,022 --> 00:36:41,399
Rym: I might have direct shared.

695
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:48,159
Scott: And if you type if you type the correct URL in your browser, the Web server that they are on will send the MP3s to you free of charge.

696
00:36:48,501 --> 00:36:55,040
Rym: I can't tell or remember if the episodes from before that point, we just never shared with anyone because we thought they were bad, maybe.

697
00:36:55,341 --> 00:37:05,764
Scott: But if I direct shared them with people, the reason they are hard to find is because there are no HTML or otherwise other documents on the Internet with a links pointing at these URLs.

698
00:37:05,885 --> 00:37:08,200
Scott: You know what I want to figure them out is to just type them in.

699
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:16,280
Scott: And I'm curious how much content is available on the Internet only in this form that you can't Google search for because it's not indexed.

700
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:20,400
Scott: But if you type in the right URL, imagine what kind of wonderful things are out there.

701
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,226
Scott: Like, are there?

702
00:37:21,266 --> 00:37:23,240
Scott: like entire movies that like no one's ever seen?

703
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,080
Scott: But there's an MP4 like hosted somewhere.

704
00:37:25,121 --> 00:37:26,458
Scott: And if you guessed it right, you could get it.

705
00:37:26,821 --> 00:37:31,020
Rym: I'll bet the A people Gaga is out there somewhere in some directory on a Unix server.

706
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:31,582
Scott: Right.

707
00:37:31,642 --> 00:37:33,539
Scott: It's like, you know, how do you even search for that?

708
00:37:34,005 --> 00:37:34,340
Rym: Gaga.

709
00:37:35,285 --> 00:37:36,500
Scott: You can't even search for that, right?

710
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,679
Rym: You know how you search for it?

711
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:44,760
Rym: The way you search for stuff in the 90s, you search to find like places that reference something that doesn't appear to exist anymore.

712
00:37:45,182 --> 00:37:48,760
Rym: And then you start poking around with URLs and directory explorers.

713
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,799
Scott: Maybe we should make a search engine specifically for this kind of search.

714
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,540
Rym: Oh, lost Web or something.

715
00:37:55,842 --> 00:37:56,043
Rym: Yeah.

716
00:37:56,063 --> 00:37:58,600
Scott: It only indexes like Apache index pages.

717
00:37:59,701 --> 00:38:00,064
Rym: Yeah.

718
00:38:00,165 --> 00:38:01,859
Scott: Actually, you know, you search by file name.

719
00:38:02,943 --> 00:38:04,140
Rym: That's something we could make.

720
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:11,560
Scott: I don't think you can search by like domain and file name and extension type and file size and things and date date because the dates are on there.

721
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,758
Scott: So you can be like old stuff only.

722
00:38:13,482 --> 00:38:17,626
Scott: So I want to find MP3 before the year 2010.

723
00:38:17,626 --> 00:38:17,727
Rym: Yeah.

724
00:38:17,747 --> 00:38:19,479
Rym: Well, you have to uncook them when you download them.

725
00:38:20,644 --> 00:38:21,295
Scott: That'll be an option.

726
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:28,863
Rym: Yeah, I read the other day, I randomly found a script that I used to use to uncook MP3s, but I download.

727
00:38:28,903 --> 00:38:31,880
Scott: someone brought up some other stuff that they found while searching.

728
00:38:32,181 --> 00:38:33,124
Rym: Oh, yeah.

729
00:38:33,325 --> 00:38:39,199
Rym: That we played a forum, Forgotten Realms, Dungeons and Dragons game on a PHP BB a long time ago.

730
00:38:39,421 --> 00:38:39,602
Rym: Yeah.

731
00:38:39,963 --> 00:38:43,540
Rym: And there is some amazing descriptive text in there.

732
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:44,239
Scott: I was a mind player.

733
00:38:45,142 --> 00:38:47,393
Rym: I was the typical.

734
00:38:47,514 --> 00:38:48,840
Rym: Alish is our looking elf dude.

735
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,104
Rym: Yeah.

736
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:49,919
Scott: You should have been a skeleton.

737
00:38:50,729 --> 00:38:51,559
Rym: I like my elf dude.

738
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:52,522
Scott: Mind Flayer.

739
00:38:53,327 --> 00:38:55,640
Rym: So Scott finally watched the end of Gravity Falls.

740
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:56,501
Scott: Yep.

741
00:38:57,025 --> 00:38:58,820
Rym: And we can now review it fully.

742
00:38:59,281 --> 00:39:00,260
Rym: I assume you've all seen it.

743
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,360
Rym: If you haven't, I guess you should.

744
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:10,180
Scott: I realized, though, when like, you know, watching all the remaining episodes I hadn't seen yet, which is right, which was a lot because you had left off before Mad Max.

745
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:10,781
Scott: Sure.

746
00:39:11,203 --> 00:39:16,565
Scott: That I don't remember a lot of stuff from earlier because this was a show that I didn't like.

747
00:39:16,585 --> 00:39:17,539
Scott: marathon all at once.

748
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:20,580
Scott: It's a show that, like, I watched over a long period of time.

749
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,979
Scott: Like, I watched it in chunks, like maybe four or five chunks.

750
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:23,341
Rym: Yep.

751
00:39:23,824 --> 00:39:26,280
Scott: And so within each chunk, I remembered everything.

752
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:31,604
Scott: But like, you know, from one chunk to the next is hard to remember everything from the previous chunk.

753
00:39:31,865 --> 00:39:39,126
Rym: Well, it's interesting because I watched like we were both watching it about the same time and then remember it like in season one, it stopped and then it started again.

754
00:39:39,146 --> 00:39:40,359
Scott: Yeah, it did that a few times.

755
00:39:41,101 --> 00:39:45,020
Scott: There's a time where it stopped after that Halloween episode at the convenience store.

756
00:39:45,221 --> 00:39:47,650
Rym: After the Halloween episode, I didn't like.

757
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:50,903
Rym: I like the show, OK, but I didn't like it that much.

758
00:39:51,063 --> 00:39:51,606
Rym: It wasn't.

759
00:39:51,786 --> 00:39:56,679
Scott: it wasn't one of those shows at any point where I was like, oh, my God, got to watch an exhibit them again.

760
00:39:57,083 --> 00:39:58,759
Rym: So I didn't pay attention to it.

761
00:39:59,040 --> 00:39:59,141
Scott: Right.

762
00:39:59,161 --> 00:40:02,420
Scott: So even when new episodes came out again, I didn't rush out to get them.

763
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,279
Scott: I sort of waited and then eventually saw them.

764
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:11,000
Rym: But then there was a point that inspired me and Emily to start watching it again was you started watching it again for some reason.

765
00:40:11,382 --> 00:40:15,001
Rym: And you got through the end of season one with Bill and like that stuff started to happen.

766
00:40:15,845 --> 00:40:19,700
Rym: And you were like, oh, Bill Triangle Guy and I saw Triangle Guy around.

767
00:40:20,343 --> 00:40:22,120
Rym: And I was like, oh, I guess Gravity Falls went somewhere.

768
00:40:22,241 --> 00:40:25,879
Rym: So I went back and started watching it and now we're done with it.

769
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:28,480
Rym: So I guess we'll try to save spoilers for the end.

770
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:32,940
Rym: But if I had to fully review this show, it is a perfectly adequate kids cartoon.

771
00:40:33,642 --> 00:40:33,984
Rym: It's good.

772
00:40:34,085 --> 00:40:36,220
Rym: It's not the greatest show in the world.

773
00:40:36,881 --> 00:40:38,760
Scott: The thing is, yeah, it's definitely not the greatest show in the world.

774
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:45,539
Scott: But I think it's it's one of those things where, you know, it doesn't really have too many flaws in itself.

775
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,202
Scott: Right.

776
00:40:46,384 --> 00:40:47,579
Scott: Just looking at it on its own.

777
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:51,440
Rym: It had potential flaws that it actually addressed satisfactorily.

778
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:51,982
Scott: Right.

779
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:56,240
Scott: But it also didn't have anything that like made it incredible.

780
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:59,295
Scott: There wasn't like some masterful thing that it did.

781
00:40:59,335 --> 00:41:01,063
Scott: that was like, oh, look at this amazing thing.

782
00:41:01,103 --> 00:41:06,234
Scott: It's just like, you know, really good, really well done, you know, unique in a lot of ways.

783
00:41:06,478 --> 00:41:06,640
Scott: Right.

784
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,700
Scott: You know, it did things that other things didn't do.

785
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:12,660
Scott: It was a kid's story wise, character wise, art wise, pretty unique.

786
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:13,022
Scott: Right.

787
00:41:13,062 --> 00:41:17,003
Rym: It's a kid's show that set up some kinds of relationships and then had them not work out.

788
00:41:17,304 --> 00:41:19,919
Rym: It's also a kid's show that got real scary.

789
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:20,681
Scott: Sure.

790
00:41:20,761 --> 00:41:26,740
Scott: And also, it's better than a lot of its, you know, contemporary works.

791
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:27,447
Scott: It's not the best.

792
00:41:27,508 --> 00:41:28,520
Scott: It's not Adventure Time good.

793
00:41:29,143 --> 00:41:29,344
Scott: Right.

794
00:41:29,425 --> 00:41:31,040
Rym: It's not even Avatar good.

795
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:34,040
Rym: Avatar is still like a full tier above.

796
00:41:34,341 --> 00:41:35,678
Rym: I haven't seen that, but you should watch.

797
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:40,507
Scott: It's better than like a lot of the garbage you watch, like the kid who's a fish or whatever.

798
00:41:40,548 --> 00:41:41,200
Scott: It's better than that.

799
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:43,560
Rym: The Amazing World of Gumball is an amazing kid's show.

800
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,751
Scott: And it's better than Teen Titans.

801
00:41:45,792 --> 00:41:47,160
Rym: Go is also an amazing kid's show.

802
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:47,906
Scott: I haven't seen that.

803
00:41:47,926 --> 00:41:49,060
Rym: Actually, it's an amazing adult show.

804
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,180
Rym: You should watch the hell out of it.

805
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,687
Scott: But, you know, it's better.

806
00:41:51,908 --> 00:41:54,140
Rym: Do you hate all the DC stuff that's dumb?

807
00:41:56,341 --> 00:41:56,884
Scott: Mostly, yeah.

808
00:41:57,106 --> 00:41:59,543
Rym: Then you'll like Teen Titans because it's nothing but making fun of that crap.

809
00:41:59,563 --> 00:42:01,377
Scott: Yeah, but it's still dumb DC stuff.

810
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,745
Rym: Yeah, but I'll put it this way.

811
00:42:02,825 --> 00:42:06,559
Rym: People who actually like DC really don't like Teen Titans and everyone else likes it.

812
00:42:06,821 --> 00:42:11,520
Scott: Anyway, but yeah, it's there's a lot of things that Gravity Falls is better than.

813
00:42:11,901 --> 00:42:16,882
Scott: And that's why, even though it's not like, oh, my God, the greatest thing ever, you have.

814
00:42:16,922 --> 00:42:19,440
Scott: you're done watching like Adventure Time and a few other things.

815
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:19,863
Scott: It's like.

816
00:42:19,883 --> 00:42:20,166
Scott: this is the.

817
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,500
Scott: this is the next thing on list.

818
00:42:21,701 --> 00:42:25,880
Rym: It's a good show to watch, like while you're eating dinner, like watch an episode while you're doing stuff when you get home.

819
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:29,820
Scott: Like, well, I think I'll sort of write because it's it's got so much going on.

820
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:31,820
Scott: I think you really got to pay attention to it closely.

821
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:36,023
Rym: I mean, like eating dinner, not like playing a game or doing something else, like distracting.

822
00:42:36,083 --> 00:42:41,659
Scott: I mean, I'm one of those weirdos who always gives everything I'm watching full attention if I'm actually going to watch something.

823
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:47,384
Rym: I the only splitting attention I'll do these days is I will watch some things while I'm eating dinner.

824
00:42:47,686 --> 00:42:50,139
Rym: But those are things like Last Week Tonight or The Daily Show.

825
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:51,350
Scott: Pretty much running, man.

826
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:51,898
Scott: That's about it.

827
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:52,361
Rym: Yeah.

828
00:42:52,743 --> 00:42:55,900
Rym: Or like a Simpsons episode, which Simpsons is pretty good lately.

829
00:42:56,401 --> 00:42:57,780
Scott: I haven't watched the Simpsons episode.

830
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,280
Rym: I've been watching a lot of old Simpsons.

831
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:01,740
Scott: I can't even remember the last time I watched the Simpsons.

832
00:43:02,102 --> 00:43:02,767
Rym: Some recent ones.

833
00:43:03,451 --> 00:43:04,700
Rym: Pretty good, actually.

834
00:43:05,422 --> 00:43:05,749
Scott: Anyway.

835
00:43:05,954 --> 00:43:06,220
Rym: Anyway.

836
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:15,002
Rym: But Gravity Falls is I don't want to even compare it because there's some kid shows like The Amazing World of Gumball that are mostly comedy and they're kind of a separate space.

837
00:43:15,403 --> 00:43:17,168
Rym: Gravity Falls is in that space of.

838
00:43:17,549 --> 00:43:26,660
Rym: it's a kid show that has a plot and continuity and has serious moments and a serious story that resolves itself in a serious way.

839
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,324
Scott: You know what I think?

840
00:43:27,344 --> 00:43:29,260
Scott: I think it's at the same level as Bravest Warriors.

841
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:29,920
Scott: That's a level.

842
00:43:30,581 --> 00:43:30,983
Rym: Hmm.

843
00:43:31,769 --> 00:43:33,280
Rym: So I like Bravest Warriors.

844
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,459
Scott: And it's real similar to Bravest Warriors in a lot of ways, too.

845
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:37,480
Rym: A lot more than I like Gravity Falls.

846
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:42,420
Rym: But I don't think I can disagree with you saying that they're similar, like average quality.

847
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:46,080
Scott: But I mean, even the plots of similar kind of things going on, right?

848
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:57,800
Scott: Even though Gravity Falls is more of a present day and deals more fantasy aesthetic and Bravest Warriors as a future space aesthetic, it's more unicorns and shit.

849
00:43:58,202 --> 00:44:00,480
Rym: Yeah, magical realism is like the real world.

850
00:44:00,801 --> 00:44:02,760
Rym: And then wait, wait, wait.

851
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:04,660
Scott: I mean, there are aliens and stuff in Bigfoot.

852
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:04,861
Scott: Right.

853
00:44:04,881 --> 00:44:08,980
Scott: But well, that's still a situation of in Bravest Warriors.

854
00:44:09,221 --> 00:44:09,342
Scott: Right.

855
00:44:09,362 --> 00:44:11,520
Scott: It's this mystery of like, oh, what's going on?

856
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:14,060
Scott: There's this emotion lord guy and weird shit.

857
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:14,382
Scott: Right.

858
00:44:14,422 --> 00:44:15,659
Scott: And Gravity Falls like, oh, this town.

859
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:16,430
Scott: Weird shit.

860
00:44:16,716 --> 00:44:16,900
Scott: Right.

861
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:25,742
Rym: What's interesting is if you watch season one until like they have the mystery of the book, but they don't really push it like it's like X-Files, like it starts with like there's a mystery.

862
00:44:26,144 --> 00:44:34,140
Scott: And then for most of the Gravity Falls has a I think a too high proportion of a Nami episodes that don't deal with the plot of the book.

863
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:34,622
Scott: Yes.

864
00:44:35,224 --> 00:44:39,120
Rym: Most of season one is entirely forgettable, like they're OK episodes.

865
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:45,596
Scott: But like if you even want even late near the end of the show, there was one episode that was oh, which one was the one?

866
00:44:46,304 --> 00:44:47,299
Scott: Yeah, the DMD one.

867
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:47,984
Scott: Oh, screw that.

868
00:44:48,024 --> 00:44:49,292
Rym: DMD episode was really.

869
00:44:49,513 --> 00:44:50,580
Scott: that was a bad episode.

870
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:56,580
Rym: You can tell when a show that might be the worst episode in the show, the DMD one, because it does that thing of, hey, let's spoof a genre.

871
00:44:57,081 --> 00:45:00,620
Rym: And clearly did not know anything about that genre at all.

872
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:04,078
Scott: Well, no, I mean, clearly the people who, you know, had played D&D.

873
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:08,100
Scott: But the point is that Dexter's Lab already did the D&D episode.

874
00:45:08,642 --> 00:45:11,280
Scott: So there's no reason for anyone else to ever attempt to do that again.

875
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:15,385
Scott: You're only going to do worse than that, because that is like one of the best episodes of Dexter's Lab.

876
00:45:15,626 --> 00:45:18,020
Scott: That says a lot about Dexter's Lab versus Gravity Falls.

877
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:19,940
Scott: Not that those are related to each other.

878
00:45:20,883 --> 00:45:22,190
Rym: Dexter's Lab is more against.

879
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:31,960
Scott: the D&D episode of Dexter's Lab is one of the best episodes of Dexter's Lab, except for maybe like Action Hank and Omelette du Fromage and yeah, the high concept one.

880
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:32,481
Scott: Right.

881
00:45:32,581 --> 00:45:38,680
Scott: But the D&D episode of Gravity Falls is like the worst episode of Gravity Falls.

882
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:44,380
Rym: But if like when season one, until Bill showed up, I was getting a little bored.

883
00:45:44,501 --> 00:45:46,980
Rym: And I was like, if I missed an episode, I wouldn't have noticed.

884
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:52,520
Scott: I think, well, because the the one thing in Gravity Falls is they have many plot lines.

885
00:45:52,621 --> 00:45:52,822
Scott: Right.

886
00:45:53,426 --> 00:45:55,460
Scott: Every character has like a plot that's got to resolve.

887
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:56,789
Rym: Well, every character has their arc.

888
00:45:56,830 --> 00:45:58,120
Rym: That's obviously going forward.

889
00:45:58,261 --> 00:46:01,000
Rym: That got incrementally pushed in some episodes, but not others.

890
00:46:01,221 --> 00:46:01,422
Rym: Right.

891
00:46:01,503 --> 00:46:04,379
Rym: There was the overall plot of the book and what's going on with that.

892
00:46:05,122 --> 00:46:07,700
Rym: And then there was the local mystery of that episode.

893
00:46:07,921 --> 00:46:08,182
Rym: Yes.

894
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:12,880
Scott: But the thing is, it's some of these plot lines are really interesting and cool.

895
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:14,679
Scott: And some of the characters and some are not.

896
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:15,041
Scott: Right.

897
00:46:15,302 --> 00:46:19,340
Scott: So the whole like Wendy Dipper thing is like it's there for the whole fucking show.

898
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:23,759
Scott: And it gets way more attention than it deserves because it's one of the plot lines that are like the not good one.

899
00:46:24,201 --> 00:46:26,240
Rym: Yeah, I am so uninterested.

900
00:46:26,481 --> 00:46:35,560
Rym: And I think the audience of the show is, too, in that typical trope of the protagonist guy really likes this girl and a bunch of teen bullshit happens.

901
00:46:36,601 --> 00:46:40,100
Scott: Yeah, there should have been way more Stan, replace all that with more Stan stuff.

902
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:42,580
Rym: But to their credit, they took that.

903
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:48,200
Rym: And then when they started getting serious, they basically just stabbed that relationship to death and had a.

904
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:53,040
Scott: But they still kept, you know, the existence of that plot line didn't leave.

905
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:56,678
Scott: Even in the final episode, they kept, you know, giving it some that.

906
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:57,891
Rym: No, they resolved it.

907
00:46:57,911 --> 00:46:58,460
Rym: It was friendship.

908
00:46:58,720 --> 00:46:59,081
Scott: Sure.

909
00:46:59,101 --> 00:47:09,180
Rym: But they still kept, you know, it was more that there were too many episodes that had a primary driver of Dipper wants to get with this girl and does stupid crap because of it.

910
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:09,601
Scott: Yep.

911
00:47:10,263 --> 00:47:15,560
Rym: And actually, no, if I was to say the worst episode of the show, it's the one where Dipper tries to pick up girls.

912
00:47:16,121 --> 00:47:16,743
Scott: That's a bad one.

913
00:47:16,763 --> 00:47:24,200
Scott: That's probably the worst one, because the problem is that episode is saved by all the other stuff that goes on and all the day where they're pranking all the different.

914
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:27,480
Scott: Yeah, that is that concept is great.

915
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:29,320
Scott: And I wish they would have given that more screen time.

916
00:47:29,441 --> 00:47:31,499
Rym: I like how the pranks were all just crimes.

917
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:34,740
Scott: Well, like, yeah, well, like he said he was basically going to turn the mountain upside down.

918
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,007
Scott: I was like, oh, man, let's see.

919
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:38,260
Scott: And he didn't really, you know, do much.

920
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:39,062
Scott: It's like, oh, come on.

921
00:47:39,543 --> 00:47:49,300
Rym: But in that episode, the moral of it was basically if you're a guy and you ever talk to a girl in any friendly way, you're clearly trying to date her and she'll give you her phone number if you're confident.

922
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:51,540
Rym: But then if you talk to a second girl ever, you're cheating.

923
00:47:51,821 --> 00:47:54,700
Rym: Yeah, that episode just was not missed the mark.

924
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:55,523
Rym: It's like the.

925
00:47:55,904 --> 00:47:59,640
Rym: it's like the episode of My Little Pony in season one where the moral was basically a leap of faith.

926
00:47:59,840 --> 00:47:59,982
Scott: Oh, yeah.

927
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:01,680
Scott: Gravity Falls is not as good as My Little Pony.

928
00:48:01,781 --> 00:48:04,620
Scott: And actually, I get there's a parallel between these two shows.

929
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:13,120
Scott: And that parallel is the parallel between Diamond Tiara and Principia, whatever her name is, lives in the castle.

930
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,520
Rym: Both had plots that resolved similarly.

931
00:48:16,402 --> 00:48:17,187
Rym: Right.

932
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:18,355
Scott: The same exact character.

933
00:48:18,375 --> 00:48:19,160
Scott: Right.

934
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:19,823
Scott: Basically.

935
00:48:19,843 --> 00:48:20,206
Rym: Yeah.

936
00:48:20,407 --> 00:48:22,260
Rym: Pretty sure her and Dipper eventually date.

937
00:48:22,822 --> 00:48:23,568
Rym: That's my guess.

938
00:48:24,012 --> 00:48:24,959
Rym: They set that up nicely.

939
00:48:26,701 --> 00:48:32,580
Scott: You know, if you're wondering about the show, the point the point I wanted to make about that, though, is that the girl in Gravity Falls, whatever her name is.

940
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:33,241
Scott: Right.

941
00:48:33,642 --> 00:48:33,963
Scott: It's like.

942
00:48:34,063 --> 00:48:41,239
Scott: it seems like when she resolves you, she actually like goes from like, you know, the start, which is I hate you die to.

943
00:48:42,204 --> 00:48:43,437
Scott: Are you actually like you now?

944
00:48:43,518 --> 00:48:43,680
Rym: Yeah.

945
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:44,629
Rym: You're awesome character.

946
00:48:44,669 --> 00:48:45,598
Scott: Diamond Tiara resolves.

947
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:47,031
Scott: And it's like you're still a bitch.

948
00:48:47,334 --> 00:48:47,698
Scott: I hate you.

949
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:49,431
Rym: Diamond Tiara did OK, though.

950
00:48:49,552 --> 00:48:50,540
Scott: I still hate Diamond Tiara.

951
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:51,693
Rym: Her parents made her that way.

952
00:48:51,937 --> 00:48:52,119
Rym: Yeah.

953
00:48:52,621 --> 00:48:53,760
Scott: Also, she can still dine to fire.

954
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,773
Rym: Her fucking cutie mark made her the way she is.

955
00:48:57,135 --> 00:48:57,879
Rym: Can't escape that.

956
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:59,029
Scott: She can still dine to fire.

957
00:48:59,594 --> 00:49:00,139
Scott: Get her out of here.

958
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:04,400
Scott: If she's she's on screen, I don't want her to be on screen.

959
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:06,699
Scott: If the other girl's on screen, I'm like, yeah, all right.

960
00:49:07,801 --> 00:49:09,340
Rym: We got to wear that llama sweater.

961
00:49:09,581 --> 00:49:15,840
Rym: I'd rather have had an episode where maybe her toadies should have betrayed her in some epic Nanami style fashion.

962
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,082
Scott: Maybe.

963
00:49:17,102 --> 00:49:18,245
Rym: But anyway, so.

964
00:49:18,866 --> 00:49:24,220
Rym: but Gravity Falls just was OK until Bill came and they started following the plot.

965
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,620
Rym: It's like the opposite of the X-Files.

966
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:27,920
Rym: The X-Files was only good when it was Monster of the Week.

967
00:49:28,222 --> 00:49:30,620
Rym: And then when they started actually following the plot, it was stupid.

968
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:32,808
Scott: Well, the other problem with X-Files is that they didn't.

969
00:49:33,109 --> 00:49:35,980
Scott: they kept when they followed the plot, they didn't really follow it.

970
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,014
Scott: They just said, oh, remember, there's a plot that's.

971
00:49:39,255 --> 00:49:40,160
Scott: that's not stopping.

972
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:48,780
Scott: And we're never actually going to reveal that moment where anything about it, when Scully just finds a UFO, that's the last episode of X-Files I ever watched.

973
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:53,920
Scott: The second last episode X-Files ever watched because I was like, oh, my God, they found a UFO just like on the beach.

974
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:55,180
Scott: It's got like runes on it or something.

975
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,860
Rym: Part of it like flies across the room and hits the Bible and points at something.

976
00:49:59,180 --> 00:49:59,301
Scott: Right.

977
00:49:59,321 --> 00:49:59,643
Scott: It's like.

978
00:49:59,744 --> 00:50:01,937
Scott: it's like literally like you found the shit like.

979
00:50:01,977 --> 00:50:02,480
Scott: here it is.

980
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:03,445
Scott: I'm standing next to it.

981
00:50:03,465 --> 00:50:06,120
Scott: And the next episode was like something completely unrelated.

982
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:09,300
Rym: And she's like, I don't think anything supernatural is going on here, Mulder.

983
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:12,460
Scott: And then they never go back to that ever.

984
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:19,500
Scott: And I don't think it like I didn't watch all X-Files, but it's like Gravity Falls takes the plot to the end.

985
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:19,901
Scott: Yep.

986
00:50:20,041 --> 00:50:25,340
Scott: It's like imagine if X-Files finds the UFO and then they go in it and Gravity Falls, they find the UFO and they go in it literally.

987
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:26,464
Rym: Only warning, guys.

988
00:50:26,746 --> 00:50:29,100
Rym: I'm just going to spoil the shit out of the show because it's also final thoughts.

989
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:30,358
Rym: We're going to talk about what actually happened.

990
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:31,300
Scott: There's not that much to spoil.

991
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:34,140
Rym: But I'm assuming you have seen the entire show at this point.

992
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:36,960
Rym: If you haven't, stop or we're just going to ruin everything.

993
00:50:37,261 --> 00:50:39,160
Scott: It's not going to be ruined if you actually enjoy it more.

994
00:50:39,281 --> 00:50:41,660
Scott: If you believe what I say and that spoilers don't spoil things.

995
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:42,082
Rym: I'll do it.

996
00:50:42,143 --> 00:50:44,099
Rym: I'll do a counterpoint to that on the Patreon.

997
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:44,926
Rym: All right.

998
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:45,760
Scott: Yeah, go ahead.

999
00:50:46,201 --> 00:50:50,440
Rym: So the I actually was wrong about the six finger thing for most of the show.

1000
00:50:50,921 --> 00:50:54,933
Rym: I thought they were setting up that it was like aliens or wizards or something like like.

1001
00:50:54,973 --> 00:50:57,300
Rym: it was something more supernatural.

1002
00:50:57,461 --> 00:51:01,040
Rym: And the fact that it literally just was his brother next to her finger was really cool.

1003
00:51:01,484 --> 00:51:02,314
Rym: Actually, I like that.

1004
00:51:02,334 --> 00:51:02,739
Rym: That's OK.

1005
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:03,863
Rym: I like that.

1006
00:51:03,903 --> 00:51:08,760
Scott: it ended up that I thought the author was just like some long dead person related to the town or something.

1007
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:10,359
Scott: Yeah, I didn't really think too hard about it.

1008
00:51:10,721 --> 00:51:21,380
Rym: And I also kind of enjoyed how the like the story ended up being simpler than I'd expected in a lot of ways, like what he was trying to do to get his brother back.

1009
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,340
Rym: Like it was all actually pretty straightforward.

1010
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:27,980
Rym: Yeah, until the until the only thing that was a mystery then was what does Bill want?

1011
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,280
Rym: Like what's his actual motivation?

1012
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:42,300
Rym: And I like how his motivation was, let's just be like all those background ghosts in the Ghostbusters, pretty much like he was dangerous and scary.

1013
00:51:42,523 --> 00:51:43,600
Rym: And I really like that.

1014
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:48,780
Rym: And I was also I did not expect them to in a show where the second season at the same opener is the first season.

1015
00:51:49,802 --> 00:51:54,659
Rym: I enjoyed how suddenly the opener is different and the whole show is just 100 percent different all the way to the end.

1016
00:51:55,921 --> 00:51:58,594
Rym: Not many kids shows, not many shows do that.

1017
00:51:58,614 --> 00:51:58,996
Rym: many episodes.

1018
00:51:59,821 --> 00:52:00,880
Scott: They could put in the extra effort.

1019
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:05,340
Scott: Remember, they put the extra effort to put like the secret codes at the end of all the episodes and even in the episodes.

1020
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:06,337
Scott: And you can read it.

1021
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:07,679
Scott: Don't bother trying to decode them.

1022
00:52:08,424 --> 00:52:09,479
Scott: You can just read them all on the wiki.

1023
00:52:10,064 --> 00:52:11,380
Scott: I was looking at about five minutes.

1024
00:52:11,908 --> 00:52:12,540
Rym: I was looking around.

1025
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:13,859
Scott: There's nothing really interesting in there.

1026
00:52:14,304 --> 00:52:15,380
Rym: Yeah, it's just drink your Ovaltine.

1027
00:52:15,546 --> 00:52:15,780
Rym: Yeah.

1028
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:17,860
Rym: But when I was looking for that, I did find something interesting.

1029
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:22,391
Rym: The fandom of the show, surprisingly, like it's not surprisingly heavily.

1030
00:52:22,491 --> 00:52:26,020
Rym: ships, Princess, Princess, what's-her-face and Mabel, not Dipper.

1031
00:52:26,865 --> 00:52:27,340
Scott: Wait, Princess.

1032
00:52:27,706 --> 00:52:28,100
Scott: Oh, really?

1033
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:28,349
Scott: Yeah.

1034
00:52:28,904 --> 00:52:30,440
Rym: That's like the number one ship.

1035
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:33,159
Scott: Are you going to ship Applejack and Diamond Tiara, too?

1036
00:52:33,841 --> 00:52:34,780
Scott: No, because Applejack.

1037
00:52:35,341 --> 00:52:37,440
Rym: I was about to say, Scott, one of them is an adult.

1038
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:38,915
Rym: That's fucked up.

1039
00:52:39,781 --> 00:52:40,280
Scott: Apple Bloom.

1040
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:41,700
Scott: I haven't watched the show in a while.

1041
00:52:42,124 --> 00:52:43,480
Scott: That is- It's not pony season.

1042
00:52:44,704 --> 00:52:45,480
Scott: Apple Bloom, right?

1043
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:45,838
Scott: Yes.

1044
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:46,289
Scott: Yeah.

1045
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:46,632
Scott: Yes.

1046
00:52:47,182 --> 00:52:47,312
Scott: Yeah.

1047
00:52:47,461 --> 00:52:48,077
Scott: You're not doing that.

1048
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,000
Scott: No, but actually- That's the same thing.

1049
00:52:50,761 --> 00:52:56,740
Rym: Ah, but I think that's a little- That could be more rationalizing Gravity Falls than your synthetic example from My Little Pony.

1050
00:52:57,821 --> 00:53:05,160
Rym: Because the Princess, Princess girl is kind of weirdly obsessed with Mabel in a way that none of those ponies are really in Pony.

1051
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:07,196
Rym: Anyway.

1052
00:53:08,701 --> 00:53:10,739
Rym: So, the end was kind of a cop out.

1053
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:24,940
Rym: I mean, it was a kid's show, so I guess, sure, you got to have the happy ending, but even in a kid's show, I feel like it's not the greatest idea to have a sacrifice that resolves the plot.

1054
00:53:25,342 --> 00:53:28,219
Rym: And then, within five minutes, undo that sacrifice.

1055
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:33,780
Scott: That's what bothered me about it the most, was not that it did it, because it's sort of obvious, like, oh yeah, you know, they're just, right?

1056
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:37,700
Scott: It was that they basically got his memory back within like a minute.

1057
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,799
Scott: It's like, it's like, uh, shouldn't that take more time?

1058
00:53:41,261 --> 00:53:44,140
Rym: If I were them, I would have done the show slightly differently.

1059
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:53,059
Rym: The entire show would be 100% the same, except the two episodes they get rid of that we talked about, but in that moment, like, he'd wake up and there's a scene where, like, they're trying to make him remember and he doesn't.

1060
00:53:53,861 --> 00:54:05,399
Rym: I would have then cut to, like, the forward flashbacks or whatever, and the last scene of the show would have just been, like, forwarding him off on the boat doing their thing, and he's suddenly like, "Something, something,

1061
00:54:05,419 --> 00:54:05,599
Rym: Seuss!".

1062
00:54:06,482 --> 00:54:08,196
Rym: And then, he's like, "Wait, who's

1063
00:54:08,216 --> 00:54:08,519
Rym: Seuss?".

1064
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:12,620
Rym: And he's like, it's like, hint that he's starting to remember and leave it at that.

1065
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,397
Rym: But no, they literally had the, "Come on,

1066
00:54:15,457 --> 00:54:15,800
Rym: remember!".

1067
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,069
Rym: He's like, "Okay, I remember everything.

1068
00:54:17,876 --> 00:54:17,997
Rym: It's

1069
00:54:18,097 --> 00:54:18,218
Rym: over.".

1070
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:19,720
Scott: Yeah, and it only took a minute.

1071
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:32,820
Scott: It would have been cool, though, maybe, like, if you want to do the memory-losing thing, you could have done it earlier and then had some episodes, you know, in between, like, dark times where he doesn't remember and they're dealing with that, and then it comes back later.

1072
00:54:32,861 --> 00:54:33,519
Scott: That would have been okay.

1073
00:54:33,901 --> 00:54:38,519
Scott: Or you could have just had him beat the bad guy without making a sacrifice, just like, "Aha, we got

1074
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:38,680
Scott: you!".

1075
00:54:38,841 --> 00:54:40,319
Scott: Just make something up, and then that's fine.

1076
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,600
Rym: Yeah, but victory without sacrifice is often also a boring story.

1077
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:46,040
Scott: You could have made a different sacrifice that you wouldn't have had to undo.

1078
00:54:46,502 --> 00:54:49,920
Rym: They could have killed, like, Mabel or something, just let the internet go crazy.

1079
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:59,660
Scott: No, you don't have to do something like that, but you could have, you know, I mean, you could have killed a less important character, but you also could have just, like, lose an arm, lose a leg.

1080
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:00,436
Rym: You know what I expected?

1081
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,874
Scott: You could have also lost a non-person, right?

1082
00:55:02,894 --> 00:55:03,880
Scott: You could have lost the shack.

1083
00:55:04,922 --> 00:55:05,500
Rym: I expected...

1084
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:09,000
Scott: Right, the shack explodes, even though I really like the Seuss Gets the Shack, I like that part.

1085
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:14,139
Rym: I expected that maybe if they'd fixed everything, the sacrifice would have been, "None of them would remember all the weird

1086
00:55:14,159 --> 00:55:14,420
Rym: stuff.".

1087
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:16,080
Scott: Maybe, they could have lost the whole town.

1088
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:20,729
Rym: Yeah, but instead, notice how the end was basically, "This town is now literally Springfield,".

1089
00:55:21,069 --> 00:55:24,757
Rym: because they're like, "Let us all never talk about it again.

1090
00:55:24,777 --> 00:55:26,360
Rym: Let's just not talk about

1091
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:26,420
Rym: it.".

1092
00:55:26,681 --> 00:55:29,680
Scott: So there's one plot hole in the show that I'm trying to figure out, right?

1093
00:55:29,801 --> 00:55:30,240
Rym: What's your plot hole?

1094
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:34,020
Scott: So it's not the biggest plot hole in the world, but it is slightly questionable, right?

1095
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:37,900
Scott: So their parents send them to this town to live with their uncle, right?

1096
00:55:38,261 --> 00:55:50,358
Scott: But if you notice, when he leaves home, presumably, I guess it's the kids' grandparents, because he's great Uncle Stan.

1097
00:55:50,378 --> 00:55:51,400
Scott: He's not regular Uncle Stan.

1098
00:55:51,920 --> 00:56:02,180
Scott: So his sister, who's only shown in the show as a tiny baby for a frame or two, is Mabel and Dipper's grandma, right?

1099
00:56:02,282 --> 00:56:02,657
Rym: I guess.

1100
00:56:04,962 --> 00:56:10,356
Scott: So her children are Dipper and Mabel's parents, right?

1101
00:56:10,637 --> 00:56:11,740
Scott: You never see their parents.

1102
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:20,676
Scott: But Stan left home and never went back home, so he didn't even know Mabel and Dipper's grandma, his sister.

1103
00:56:20,696 --> 00:56:21,397
Scott: He didn't even know her.

1104
00:56:21,637 --> 00:56:22,900
Scott: He never met her his whole life.

1105
00:56:23,884 --> 00:56:26,279
Rym: I guess they must have just un-estranged at some point.

1106
00:56:26,881 --> 00:56:28,185
Scott: They didn't show it in the show.

1107
00:56:28,205 --> 00:56:30,634
Scott: In fact, it's highly suggested.

1108
00:56:30,654 --> 00:56:32,400
Scott: he never went home ever, right?

1109
00:56:32,701 --> 00:56:34,587
Scott: So he was estranged from that person.

1110
00:56:34,888 --> 00:56:38,440
Scott: How did he even know Mabel and Dipper's parents, right?

1111
00:56:39,281 --> 00:56:44,340
Scott: And how did Mabel and Dipper's parents know to send him there?

1112
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:48,980
Rym: Maybe Dipper and Mabel's parents died in a horrific accident.

1113
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:52,839
Rym: The kids are, like, in denial, like they can't believe it.

1114
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:58,780
Rym: And the state tracked down their nearest living relative and just fucking shipped him there.

1115
00:56:59,121 --> 00:57:01,760
Scott: But they had to go back home to California when the summer's over.

1116
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:05,100
Rym: Rarely until they got a foster home because he was clearly unfit to raise them.

1117
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:06,339
Scott: Anyway, you're really going on a limb.

1118
00:57:07,103 --> 00:57:08,560
Rym: I don't think that's that much of a limb.

1119
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:14,420
Scott: So anyway, especially since they say in the show, "Oh yeah, there's so much and such as kids," right?

1120
00:57:14,781 --> 00:57:15,749
Scott: It's like, right?

1121
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:17,180
Scott: Anyway, and they mention their parents.

1122
00:57:17,461 --> 00:57:20,589
Rym: Maybe they're going through a messy divorce.

1123
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:23,577
Rym: They tracked him down, like, "Look, take care of the kids.

1124
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:24,679
Rym: We gotta sort our shit

1125
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:24,880
Rym: out.".

1126
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:25,423
Scott: They're on summer break.

1127
00:57:25,443 --> 00:57:28,660
Scott: Okay, so then here's the other less-but-still-existing plot hole, right?

1128
00:57:28,981 --> 00:57:34,280
Scott: So their parents send them to live with their great-uncle, who they thought was the different great-uncle, but that doesn't really matter that much, right?

1129
00:57:36,022 --> 00:57:38,560
Scott: For the summer, and they would come back home when the summer was over.

1130
00:57:40,721 --> 00:57:41,685
Scott: It's at the end of the show.

1131
00:57:41,805 --> 00:57:45,740
Scott: It's highly assumed next summer they're gonna go back to Gravity Falls, like it's their summer camp.

1132
00:57:46,663 --> 00:57:48,339
Scott: But their uncle don't live there no more.

1133
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:54,420
Scott: Are they gonna send them to live with Seuss, this guy their parents don't even know, to live for the summer, right?

1134
00:57:56,122 --> 00:57:57,749
Scott: That doesn't make any fucking sense at all.

1135
00:57:57,769 --> 00:57:59,497
Scott: They're not gonna go on the boat in the summer, right?

1136
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:04,679
Scott: So if they go back to Gravity Falls in the summer, sure, they have a ton of friends there and people they could live with.

1137
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:08,060
Scott: But are our parents really gonna send them to live with these complete strangers?

1138
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:09,523
Scott: Some people they knew.

1139
00:58:09,543 --> 00:58:12,995
Scott: When you go somewhere for the summer, you're only there for eight to twelve weeks.

1140
00:58:13,276 --> 00:58:14,460
Scott: Tops, right?

1141
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:16,193
Scott: That's how long they know these people.

1142
00:58:16,213 --> 00:58:16,959
Scott: Eight to twelve weeks.

1143
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:21,278
Rym: They're smart enough to just lie and be like, "Yeah, we're gonna go back to Grunkle Stan's

1144
00:58:21,298 --> 00:58:21,620
Rym: house.".

1145
00:58:21,761 --> 00:58:23,373
Scott: And their parents are gonna call Grunkle Stan.

1146
00:58:23,413 --> 00:58:24,239
Scott: He's not gonna be there.

1147
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:27,960
Rym: Their parents did not call at any point in the entire show to find out.

1148
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:29,164
Scott: That's also fucked up.

1149
00:58:29,806 --> 00:58:34,340
Scott: That is also something that was on my mind the whole time, is they have telephones.

1150
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:36,153
Rym: That's why I think there's some merit.

1151
00:58:36,193 --> 00:58:37,140
Rym: It's not that much of a limb.

1152
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:49,080
Scott: There is something, that is the strange thing that is going on, is like, not the fact that like they don't, the parents are out of the picture, you know, which happens in a lot of shows, but like, what, how was this arranged to begin with?

1153
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:52,160
Rym: So that's why I'm suspecting, like them being dead is a stretch.

1154
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:54,371
Scott: Your explanation is really off on a limb.

1155
00:58:54,431 --> 00:58:56,200
Scott: There's gotta be a more reasonable explanation.

1156
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:57,343
Rym: Yeah, them being dead is a stretch.

1157
00:58:58,547 --> 00:59:02,540
Rym: Home problems, or them not being great people, much more reasonable.

1158
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:10,320
Scott: How do they even know Grunkle Stan, this person who's estranged from their family and never met their grandma, the only person who they would have met in their family?

1159
00:59:10,661 --> 00:59:11,054
Rym: I don't know.

1160
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:12,780
Scott: It makes no sense.

1161
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:13,779
Rym: Gotta think about this.

1162
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:14,979
Scott: That's the part that makes no sense.

1163
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:19,740
Rym: Meanwhile, the show brought back the giant Time Baby, and then that Time Baby got wrecked.

1164
00:59:19,921 --> 00:59:27,600
Scott: I know, the Time Baby came back, so first of all, in one of the codes, it says Time Baby's like, gonna reconstitute himself, it's gonna take a long time, so he's not dead.

1165
00:59:29,006 --> 00:59:30,240
Scott: And he's gonna be pissed when he comes back.

1166
00:59:30,741 --> 00:59:38,199
Scott: Also, when the Time Guy came back, and the Time Baby came back, I remembered, oh right, they existed, I knew those characters, I recognized them.

1167
00:59:38,721 --> 00:59:48,300
Scott: I didn't remember any of the episodes they were in, so I looked on the wiki, Time Guy, who's named, his name is like, I forget what his- Jason Alexander?

1168
00:59:48,723 --> 00:59:55,760
Scott: No, the Time Guy, his name is basically like, it suggests that he's a background, like, not noticed person or something.

1169
00:59:57,001 --> 01:00:04,279
Scott: And Time Baby, like, they were in a bunch of episodes, not just like one, they were in a few, and I totally forgot anything that happened in those episodes.

1170
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:07,140
Rym: You know, you really don't, oh well, Blendin Blandin.

1171
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:09,018
Scott: Yeah, Blendin, that's his name, he blends in.

1172
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:12,259
Rym: He just, he reminded me of a George Costanza.

1173
01:00:12,941 --> 01:00:13,380
Scott: Yeah, kinda.

1174
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:15,919
Rym: He's kinda just a shitty, vindictive person.

1175
01:00:16,342 --> 01:00:24,340
Rym: Though, to be fair, he was right, Dipper and Mabel were just little shits, they got him in trouble, and that Time Baby future is not a great future.

1176
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:24,693
Scott: Nope.

1177
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:25,800
Rym: That's a terrible future.

1178
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:29,560
Rym: The world ends in a terrible future, regardless of what they did.

1179
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:31,097
Scott: The town ends, the world doesn't end.

1180
01:00:32,542 --> 01:00:34,120
Rym: Time Baby shit happens in the future.

1181
01:00:34,301 --> 01:00:34,979
Scott: Oh right, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1182
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:40,780
Rym: Time Baby happens, the world is fucked, nothing they did matters, because the Time Baby future is terrible.

1183
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:41,377
Rym: That's right.

1184
01:00:41,962 --> 01:00:46,680
Rym: So yeah, I guess if they do another show, they could be like the War Against Time Baby.

1185
01:00:48,461 --> 01:00:50,840
Scott: So what episodes did you like the most?

1186
01:00:52,501 --> 01:01:09,178
Rym: Honestly, I really enjoyed the episodes inside Mabel's head, like that whole crazy side story of them trying to assemble the team, and I enjoyed the first couple episodes of When Mad Max Happened, because it's rare that a show will take such a hard swerve in tone.

1187
01:01:10,103 --> 01:01:20,440
Scott: See, it was the swerve where it comes to the portal, I actually liked more the swerve where they were dealing with the stone cutters in the town, and McGucket, that earlier part there.

1188
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:23,714
Rym: The mystery had so much potential, you're like, "Whoa, what's going on?

1189
01:01:23,935 --> 01:01:24,659
Scott: What's the

1190
01:01:24,699 --> 01:01:24,960
Scott: story?".

1191
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,279
Scott: It was almost like a hot fuzz with the people in the town, no.

1192
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:31,340
Scott: And that part was way more interesting than the other, right?

1193
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:35,940
Scott: And there were some of the side episodes that didn't have plot, I still liked.

1194
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:38,135
Scott: So I liked the one with the Love God.

1195
01:01:38,176 --> 01:01:39,939
Scott: for some reason, Love God character was just really...

1196
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,560
Rym: I also enjoyed the Love God, I liked the Multi-Bear.

1197
01:01:42,303 --> 01:01:43,159
Scott: Multi-Bear was okay.

1198
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:44,860
Rym: I think someone is obsessed with the Multi-Bear.

1199
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:48,879
Scott: The Unicorn episode, which actually was a plot episode, I liked the unicorns.

1200
01:01:50,863 --> 01:01:56,717
Rym: I thought that episode was going a certain way until the reveal of, "No, that unicorn's just an asshole, for

1201
01:01:56,777 --> 01:01:57,018
Rym: real.".

1202
01:01:57,867 --> 01:01:58,777
Scott: I liked the unicorns.

1203
01:02:00,463 --> 01:02:02,200
Scott: The Street Fighter one, not so much.

1204
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:05,600
Scott: I mean, it sort of felt pandery, but maybe that's just because I'm a nerd.

1205
01:02:06,163 --> 01:02:08,780
Rym: The one where Mabel has the boy band.

1206
01:02:08,981 --> 01:02:09,539
Scott: That's a good one.

1207
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:13,000
Rym: That might be my favorite regular episode of the show.

1208
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:23,160
Scott: Oh, and I can't be neglected to mention one of the biggest characters in the show, which is the stupid kid who's all southern cowboy hick, whatever his name is.

1209
01:02:24,701 --> 01:02:25,116
Scott: The bad guy.

1210
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:26,318
Scott: Yeah, Gideon.

1211
01:02:27,423 --> 01:02:28,920
Scott: He's just mad annoying.

1212
01:02:29,641 --> 01:02:30,420
Rym: That's the point.

1213
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:34,320
Rym: He's basically... There's some Eric Hartman buried inside of his genteel.

1214
01:02:34,947 --> 01:02:36,060
Scott: Yeah, that's exactly what it is.

1215
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,120
Scott: He's Eric Hartman, for sure.

1216
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:38,493
Scott: He's Eric Hartman plus the KKK.

1217
01:02:40,483 --> 01:02:46,558
Scott: Not that Eric Hartman isn't in the KKK, because he totally is, complaining about Jews all the time.

1218
01:02:50,022 --> 01:03:03,840
Rym: But if I had to name my favorite weird character side thing, other than Giffany, which was pretty good, that whole bit, I enjoyed the demon that's just a head with an arm that's walking around trying to eat people.

1219
01:03:04,366 --> 01:03:05,297
Scott: Yeah, that's a funny side bit.

1220
01:03:05,901 --> 01:03:07,879
Rym: Because that's a very Rick and Morty kind of monster.

1221
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:15,360
Rym: And that also signifies the tone shift where the show really avoided talking about killing or death and was always very kid show friendly.

1222
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:16,760
Scott: People got turned to stone.

1223
01:03:17,902 --> 01:03:21,880
Rym: Yup, but then at the end of the show, when the final swerve happened...

1224
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:22,440
Scott: They killed the mayor.

1225
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:28,997
Rym: Yeah, but remember that scene where Bill is like, "I think I'm just gonna kill one of

1226
01:03:29,078 --> 01:03:29,319
Rym: them.".

1227
01:03:29,801 --> 01:03:33,860
Rym: And I think that might be the first point anyone referenced actual killing in the entire show.

1228
01:03:34,462 --> 01:03:39,632
Rym: That scene was really well done, because it shifted from kid show to, "Oh shit, now it's

1229
01:03:39,652 --> 01:03:40,098
Rym: serious.".

1230
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:42,420
Rym: Eeny, meeny, miny, and that.

1231
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:54,139
Scott: Yeah, it does feel a bit at times, even though it's obviously loaded with fantasy and magic, and your suspension of disbelief is in full effect when you see gnomes peeking rainbows.

1232
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:58,338
Rym: Yeah, they make a lot of noise in places where they're trying to be quiet, and somehow no one notices.

1233
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:11,160
Scott: Right, but stuff like, even towards the very end, they're shot out of the cannon of the robot arm, and then parachute into the thing, and it's like they're falling great distances off the bridge and then land.

1234
01:04:13,804 --> 01:04:17,334
Scott: It's hard to believe when they use a non-magical thing.

1235
01:04:17,755 --> 01:04:19,460
Scott: that's ridiculous, right?

1236
01:04:19,780 --> 01:04:25,439
Rym: Well, especially because that did not happen in the earlier episodes of the show, and it happened more and more as the show went on.

1237
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:29,539
Scott: Right, if you're using shrink rays and stuff, it's kind of like, "I can deal with

1238
01:04:29,579 --> 01:04:29,680
Scott: that.".

1239
01:04:29,841 --> 01:04:33,800
Scott: Then it really stands out when you use something non-magical, and it's still ridiculous.

1240
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:36,039
Scott: You should have just used magic for the whole thing.

1241
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:42,860
Rym: Some of those bits did bother me, but the only excuse I have is, Gravity Falls is in that weird bubble, so it just made the world more cartoony there.

1242
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:43,496
Scott: Sure, maybe.

1243
01:04:44,301 --> 01:04:51,319
Rym: Or it could be like that crack show where they talk about the Simpsons, and they have a theory as to why the Simpsons town is the way it is.

1244
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:55,299
Rym: It's a pretty good theory, but it could be a situation like that.

1245
01:04:56,140 --> 01:04:59,400
Scott: This could be how Springfield was actually- I gotta do some laundry before Anime Boston.

1246
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:04,020
Rym: Yep, Gravity Falls is totally worth watching, but- It's not a waste of your time at all.

1247
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:06,560
Rym: It's a kid's show, and it's good for a kid's show.

1248
01:05:07,463 --> 01:05:08,840
Scott: It's not world-changing, right?

1249
01:05:09,002 --> 01:05:09,958
Scott: It's like 20 years from now.

1250
01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:16,056
Scott: It's like right now, it's probably near the top of your list, but 20 years from now, it'll just be like, "One of those shows you can watch,

1251
01:05:16,076 --> 01:05:16,519
Scott: whatev.".

1252
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:20,640
Rym: Yep, I think things like Ponies, Adventure Time, Avatar, actually.

1253
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:23,460
Rym: If you want to watch something next, that's a show to watch.

1254
01:05:24,041 --> 01:05:25,879
Rym: We could review each of the four seasons of it, even.

1255
01:05:26,121 --> 01:05:26,939
Scott: That's too many seasons.

1256
01:05:27,725 --> 01:05:28,420
Rym: It's worth it, Scott.

1257
01:05:30,761 --> 01:05:34,078
Rym: I'm going to say that Avatar as a whole is as good as Escaflowne.

1258
01:05:35,241 --> 01:05:35,499
Rym: All right.

1259
01:05:35,982 --> 01:05:36,538
Rym: Straight up.

1260
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:38,360
Scott: I just watched Evangelion again.

1261
01:05:38,521 --> 01:05:38,959
Scott: Watch that again.

1262
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:40,300
Rym: Neither one's as good as Evangelion.

1263
01:05:40,501 --> 01:05:41,639
Scott: Evangelion is- Just watch it again.

1264
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:43,259
Scott: We could talk about it a whole bunch more.

1265
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:46,340
Scott: There's very little- We've talked about it, but why not talk about it some more?

1266
01:05:46,501 --> 01:05:47,979
Rym: I'll just do what we should do.

1267
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:48,779
Rym: I'll watch it again.

1268
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:49,720
Scott: Well, finish some with Tena.

1269
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:50,083
Scott: We can do.

1270
01:05:50,103 --> 01:05:51,440
Scott: Geek Dance Presents Evangelion.

1271
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:54,520
Rym: Let's just do it.

1272
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:55,020
Rym: Let's review.

1273
01:05:55,323 --> 01:06:01,699
Rym: Let's talk about Evangelion again, and then go back and listen to the last time we talked about Evangelion and see if anything's changed.

1274
01:06:02,220 --> 01:06:09,275
Scott: Well, I mean, there has been things that have changed in that there were still things in Evangelion.

1275
01:06:09,315 --> 01:06:14,580
Scott: I still didn't understand, but now after my ex watching, there's nothing in that show.

1276
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:15,220
Scott: I don't understand.

1277
01:06:15,420 --> 01:06:15,520
Rym: Yeah.

1278
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:16,957
Rym: It's like, "Why did Kaji have that

1279
01:06:16,997 --> 01:06:17,139
Rym: thing?".

1280
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:20,980
Scott: Well, duh, because- I know exactly what everything is at every moment in the show.

1281
01:06:21,260 --> 01:06:21,351
Rym: Yeah.

1282
01:06:27,221 --> 01:06:29,360
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1283
01:06:29,501 --> 01:06:34,500
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1284
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:39,900
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1285
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,840
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1286
01:06:43,101 --> 01:06:47,559
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1288
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:58,520
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience, but unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1289
01:07:16,210 --> 01:07:56,649
Rym: The Patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights are, in order of the amount of money they give us, assuming they give us at least $5, Rebecca Dunn, Nicholas Brandau, Heidi McNichol, Amanda Duchette, James David White, Christian Koontz, Jess, MyStady.com, Mechanical Mind, William Isenrose, Jeremy Miner, How Much Mud Could a Mudkip Kip If a Mudkip Would Kip Mud, Scott John Harrison, Sean Yeager, Clinton Walton, Ren from New Zealand, Robert Lee, Ryan Perrin, Drew Openlander, Rare Lavelle, Brian Sidroni, Rochelle Montanona, Finn Eric Silveraude, Can't Melt Steel Beams, Kinetic Man, Aaron Cerise, Chris Midkiff, Chris Knox, Sorry, Flame Dark Fire, I'm not going to read that one.

1290
01:07:56,950 --> 01:07:59,270
Rym: While it's moderately funny, it's over the line.

1291
01:07:59,830 --> 01:08:05,290
Rym: Sam Cordery, Daniel Redman, Chris Haddad, Sean Klein, Chris Reimer, and Thomas Hahn.

1292
01:08:06,610 --> 01:08:09,010
Rym: So as many of you are wondering, we love Anime Boston.

1293
01:08:09,190 --> 01:08:31,069
Rym: It is our favorite anime convention, both to attend and to perform at, but basically this year, they didn't just automatically comp our badges, and we ended up buying badges just because we didn't want to deal with a hassle at the con, and they are going to reimburse us, but basically we don't attend any conventions that make us buy badges and then get reimbursed.

1294
01:08:31,513 --> 01:08:50,189
Rym: It's just partly a hassle thing, like we go to enough conventions already, and basically no conventions we've ever performed at have asked us ever to buy a badge, and then get reimbursed, but Anime Boston had never done that until this year, and it appears it was in fact just a clerical error, and everything's fine for next year, so have no fear.

1295
01:08:50,550 --> 01:09:12,676
Rym: We will, assuming no date conflicts or anything weird happening, we will be returning to Anime Boston next year in 2017, and actually I'm kind of glad because we have a lot of anime content, and we really only go to one anime convention, so I guess the one interesting thing is that MAGFest sort of invited us to do our anime content there, so maybe

1296
01:09:12,697 --> 01:09:13,180
Scott: we'll make even

1297
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:14,209
Rym: more anime content now.

1298
01:09:14,830 --> 01:09:18,850
Rym: But anyway, I leave you now with something kind of weird.

1299
01:09:19,470 --> 01:09:27,786
Media: German chemists created it in 2010 with the help of the US Army in an effort to develop more energetic compounds, and their first report on the discovery.

1300
01:09:27,826 --> 01:09:33,890
Media: they said, and I quote, "The sensitivity of C2N14 is beyond our capabilities of measurement.

1301
01:09:34,251 --> 01:09:38,862
Media: Even the smallest possible loadings in shock and friction tests led to explosive

1302
01:09:38,942 --> 01:09:39,729
Media: decomposition.".

1303
01:09:39,910 --> 01:09:44,170
Media: To give you a list of how touchy this stuff is, here's a list of things that make ZYTOazide explode.

1304
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:57,750
Media: Moving it, touching it, dispersing it in solution, leaving it undisturbed on a glass plate, exposing it to bright light, exposing it to x-rays, putting it in a spectrometer, turning on the spectrometer, and my favorite, absolutely nothing.

1305
01:09:57,930 --> 01:10:03,490
Media: They had it in a shockproof explosive case in a dark climate control room, and it blew up.

1306
01:10:03,670 --> 01:10:11,270
Media: I think somebody said something mean about it somewhere, and it was like, the lead scientist on the team that synthesized it called it a very exciting discovery.
