Scott: the Predator really got the deer.

5
00:00:22,644 --> 00:00:32,252
Rym: the predator Let's do this Got a wave of what someone in a group of friends of ours has not seen.

6
00:00:32,452 --> 00:00:39,792
Rym: a perhaps important movie like a Robocop a Predator a Terminator 2 had a wave of it's cold.

7
00:00:39,972 --> 00:00:41,456
Scott: Holy shit is all today.

8
00:00:41,476 --> 00:00:50,500
Rym: Yeah, so I know there's a guy I know who biked to work a couple days ago What's up, and then he couldn't bike home because it was too cold so his bikes just sitting at his office.

9
00:00:50,865 --> 00:00:51,860
Scott: Yeah, I saw a guy today.

10
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:55,075
Scott: I was like how to bike to work in the snow, and I was like all right.

11
00:00:55,377 --> 00:00:56,020
Scott: What are you doing?

12
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:00,335
Rym: It's like zero degrees out and the answer is stay home or spend a lot of money.

13
00:01:00,535 --> 00:01:03,959
Scott: also part of the advice was leave Your eyes for dead, and I was like nope.

14
00:01:07,612 --> 00:01:10,280
Rym: Yeah Well the thing is you just got to go slow and you gotta have special tires most.

15
00:01:10,623 --> 00:01:12,520
Scott: It's not how about we just use a subway.

16
00:01:13,301 --> 00:01:14,225
Scott: Yeah, I had a bike to work.

17
00:01:14,245 --> 00:01:15,411
Scott: carry your bike onto the subway.

18
00:01:15,531 --> 00:01:17,320
Rym: Subway has been kind of shitty lately.

19
00:01:17,601 --> 00:01:18,746
Rym: It's fine for me.

20
00:01:18,987 --> 00:01:21,740
Rym: It's yeah, cuz you don't go anywhere you go like right across on going to work.

21
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:22,452
Scott: Can I go home?

22
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:22,859
Rym: yep?

23
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,560
Rym: But going downtown has been getting pretty bad because it all the people are gonna go there or whatever.

24
00:01:28,001 --> 00:01:30,571
Rym: They're all taking the subway now, and it's cold.

25
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:31,815
Rym: It's all the people like me.

26
00:01:31,835 --> 00:01:35,598
Scott: you're also taking the subway And so you are the problem.

27
00:01:35,638 --> 00:01:38,018
Rym: yes I am and you know what all those other people need to get fired.

28
00:01:38,481 --> 00:01:49,620
Rym: Oh, the people who are the same as you because if they all got fired You know what the people who don't bike in the summer Should not be allowed to ride the subway the way you get to ride the subway for six months out of the air max.

29
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:50,580
Rym: How's that?

30
00:01:53,821 --> 00:01:55,714
Rym: Whatever you say I can live with that.

31
00:01:55,734 --> 00:01:56,299
Rym: I could do that.

32
00:01:57,361 --> 00:02:01,334
Rym: So yeah, anyway got any news being Thursday being the lounge.

33
00:02:01,736 --> 00:02:03,983
Scott: It's not lunch anyway, so I'm lounging.

34
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,152
Scott: we're not going to magfest.

35
00:02:06,412 --> 00:02:07,697
Rym: ah no we are not.

36
00:02:07,758 --> 00:02:12,555
Rym: it's the first magfest since we realized magfest was awesome.

37
00:02:12,575 --> 00:02:13,679
Rym: that was worth going to.

38
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:20,470
Rym: and The only reason we're not is because Pac South is Literally the same weekend in all honesty.

39
00:02:20,511 --> 00:02:26,711
Scott: It looks like magfest is gonna be better Yeah, but then again in terms of what the convention provides.

40
00:02:27,032 --> 00:02:27,895
Rym: It's like the first packs.

41
00:02:27,955 --> 00:02:30,844
Rym: Australia like it was kind of The first pack.

42
00:02:30,864 --> 00:02:32,047
Scott: south is gonna be small.

43
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:32,328
Scott: yo

44
00:02:32,669 --> 00:02:43,500
Rym: yep, I mean I saw how many panel rooms they have and I was like okay Yeah, we'll just do one right and but at the same time the smallest panel room It packs out is still bigger than the panel rooms at magfest, so it's kind of a wash.

45
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,852
Scott: Yeah, anyway, so I just want to talk about magfest.

46
00:02:47,053 --> 00:02:54,799
Scott: not you know while it's an awesome convention Does not really have their shit together, and they didn't announce their musical lineup until just now.

47
00:02:55,059 --> 00:02:57,220
Rym: yeah The panels were just recently scheduled to.

48
00:02:57,942 --> 00:03:07,397
Scott: So I just want to point out the awesomest thing in the schedule besides the return of machine supremacy Which gives me hope they'll just return again next year, and they should just move here.

49
00:03:07,417 --> 00:03:15,560
Scott: sure You know the typical guys you always see on there like power glove the Megas DJ cut man.

50
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,945
Scott: It's a you know all the all.

51
00:03:16,985 --> 00:03:23,908
Scott: the usual crowd is there, but the headlining featured performer About at the top of the list.

52
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:26,760
Scott: the guest of honor is you Miyake?

53
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,703
Scott: Do you know whom you Miyake is?

54
00:03:28,723 --> 00:03:29,785
Rym: I actually do not.

55
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,950
Scott: you Miyake is the DJ and composer of the?

56
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,813
Scott: Katamari series.

57
00:03:36,056 --> 00:03:41,215
Rym: oh Yeah, that's pretty awesome right there were I not going to PAX South.

58
00:03:41,515 --> 00:03:43,000
Rym: I would be at that concert.

59
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:48,320
Rym: Fact I know some people who might suddenly decide to go to magfest because of that.

60
00:03:50,961 --> 00:03:58,546
Scott: I Say I saw the the only person who could beat that I already saw at magfest which was I forget your name Streets of Rage composer.

61
00:03:58,787 --> 00:04:02,020
Scott: oh yeah best video game music except for Megaman 2 music.

62
00:04:04,603 --> 00:04:07,916
Rym: So yeah if you want to go to PAX South I guess it's sold out.

63
00:04:07,976 --> 00:04:10,806
Rym: if you want to go to magfest I don't think it's sold out yet packs.

64
00:04:10,906 --> 00:04:15,218
Scott: east also is very very soon after pack and it is also sold out.

65
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:18,226
Rym: so Oh my god.

66
00:04:18,245 --> 00:04:20,320
Rym: all these conventions the ConnectiCon is coming up in July.

67
00:04:20,884 --> 00:04:26,854
Rym: Let's not do the meta moment at the news But I was just talking about conventions didn't mean about us doing things at those conventions.

68
00:04:26,995 --> 00:04:30,909
Scott: My news is just this Headlining magfest act.

69
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:32,340
Rym: yeah, all right, so I got some news.

70
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:37,499
Rym: I was gonna do this on a Monday, but I kind of wanted so much CES news.

71
00:04:37,559 --> 00:04:39,207
Scott: now We got tons of money exactly.

72
00:04:39,287 --> 00:04:42,060
Rym: so I'm pulling this in because it's also relevant to a Thursday.

73
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,876
Rym: It's relevant to the lounge your mom.

74
00:04:44,956 --> 00:04:49,199
Rym: so the other day I was I went on LinkedIn because in the kind of job that I do.

75
00:04:49,661 --> 00:04:54,960
Rym: I actually have to like go to LinkedIn and like I see an email from a person go look up to figure out like what?

76
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,185
Rym: It is that they do.

77
00:04:56,305 --> 00:05:00,638
Scott: and like I do get emails and people you don't know and use LinkedIn to find out who the fuck They are exactly like.

78
00:05:00,658 --> 00:05:02,004
Rym: yeah I actually know this person.

79
00:05:02,245 --> 00:05:08,653
Rym: my ways of what I do is first I flip through my business cards that I scan and be like Okay, have I ever met this person?

80
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:12,132
Rym: as the answer is no I look him up on LinkedIn and see if their picture rings a bell.

81
00:05:12,494 --> 00:05:14,064
Rym: if I don't know who they are then I have a Picture.

82
00:05:14,206 --> 00:05:15,218
Rym: yeah, believe it.

83
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:23,167
Rym: but and then I saw that it was telling me like it always does in that Ridiculous stupid news feed that I can't believe.

84
00:05:23,188 --> 00:05:28,210
Rym: people use where it's like a social network for people who have nothing better I can't believe people do.

85
00:05:28,632 --> 00:05:29,075
Rym: now granted.

86
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:29,760
Rym: You know what's fucked up.

87
00:05:30,021 --> 00:05:33,140
Rym: I post stuff in there all the time like whenever I'd post a geek dies episode or anything.

88
00:05:33,663 --> 00:05:41,752
Rym: I just copy/paste it in there too because whatever and I get a lot of like Emails and a lot of like messages and things about like GeekNights and things.

89
00:05:41,792 --> 00:05:51,794
Rym: It's really weird like people who uh like board game fans a couple of like Video game journalists editor types of message me a couple times.

90
00:05:52,055 --> 00:05:53,160
Scott: They follow you on LinkedIn.

91
00:05:53,461 --> 00:05:55,828
Rym: Well, I find LinkedIn with people that I know okay.

92
00:05:55,868 --> 00:05:59,960
Rym: Yeah, so anyway, I see one of those ridiculous messages.

93
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:05,560
Rym: Hey, why don't you say happy work anniversary to your good friend who just started work?

94
00:06:05,902 --> 00:06:09,749
Rym: Just worked x-years on today's date CJ Henderson.

95
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:20,983
Rym: Oh yeah, CJ Henderson died some time ago actually and that was a Slightly depressing moment to see that they're like, oh, hey LinkedIn doesn't know.

96
00:06:21,023 --> 00:06:28,679
Rym: you're dead and everyone, you know on LinkedIn just got reminded that you're dead in a kind of funny but also sad way.

97
00:06:29,285 --> 00:06:31,557
Rym: internet so independently.

98
00:06:32,461 --> 00:06:34,801
Rym: Facebook just recently Apologized.

99
00:06:35,443 --> 00:06:36,868
Scott: I don't mean the same goddamn thing.

100
00:06:36,888 --> 00:06:37,490
Rym: So yeah fate.

101
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,300
Rym: no Facebook did something even more interesting.

102
00:06:40,461 --> 00:06:42,418
Rym: It was a great idea what Facebook did.

103
00:06:42,941 --> 00:06:51,698
Rym: Facebook basically for people who had taken photos and things like, you know throughout the year For every individual person on Facebook where it had enough stuff it sent you like.

104
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:54,727
Rym: hey Here's your year in review.

105
00:06:55,489 --> 00:06:57,333
Rym: and for someone like me like awesome.

106
00:06:57,374 --> 00:06:58,095
Rym: That's that convention.

107
00:06:58,136 --> 00:06:58,697
Rym: I went to.

108
00:06:58,978 --> 00:07:01,130
Rym: that's that picture my dick I took by accident.

109
00:07:01,413 --> 00:07:02,138
Rym: That's that wedding.

110
00:07:03,043 --> 00:07:07,360
Rym: But for some people yeah, that's when my son or daughter a significant other died.

111
00:07:07,962 --> 00:07:11,655
Rym: Oh, that's my pet who isn't around anymore here in review is horrifying.

112
00:07:11,996 --> 00:07:24,401
Rym: Yeah, so People were really traumatized by Basically technology showing them what actually happened in their life for the last year in 2014.

113
00:07:24,401 --> 00:07:25,867
Scott: Well, it started off that time.

114
00:07:25,887 --> 00:07:26,530
Scott: He got sick.

115
00:07:26,831 --> 00:07:28,900
Scott: Yeah, and that vacation that was really bad.

116
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:40,417
Scott: The person you broke up with and then You know all this horribleness and then the horribleness in the news that you read tweeted or whatever that horrible photos associated with it.

117
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:44,440
Rym: and Yeah, one of the examples here is pretty tragic Eric Meyer web design.

118
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,585
Scott: You went to see this movie.

119
00:07:45,605 --> 00:07:47,936
Rym: a web designer consultant writer is one of the people.

120
00:07:48,017 --> 00:07:51,696
Rym: earlier this year He lost his daughter to brain cancer on her birthday.

121
00:07:51,716 --> 00:07:52,319
Rym: She was six.

122
00:07:53,328 --> 00:08:00,640
Rym: for that reason He had actively avoided looking at previews of his own automatically generated summarized summary posts.

123
00:08:01,161 --> 00:08:08,860
Rym: But Facebook put a personalized prompt advertising a feature in his newsfeed which prominently featured his dead daughter and a happy birthday.

124
00:08:10,722 --> 00:08:14,716
Rym: It added clip art figures to the picture like it was a birthday like it would it was.

125
00:08:14,777 --> 00:08:15,941
Rym: I looked at a page kind of Like.

126
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:23,445
Rym: it looks like the kind of thing that a an asshole would do as a mean thing to another person But it's just automatic.

127
00:08:23,525 --> 00:08:24,389
Scott: It looks at the date.

128
00:08:24,691 --> 00:08:27,624
Scott: It has a photo associated with the date It was written in there.

129
00:08:27,664 --> 00:08:29,935
Scott: as it goes up exactly hurt this person's birthday.

130
00:08:29,955 --> 00:08:30,820
Scott: I have a photo of them.

131
00:08:31,223 --> 00:08:32,659
Scott: They're associated with this person.

132
00:08:33,121 --> 00:08:36,813
Scott: The problem is why don't these systems just have a way to mark someone as dead?

133
00:08:37,395 --> 00:08:37,977
Scott: then it was.

134
00:08:38,197 --> 00:08:41,131
Rym: that's why I wanted to Everything on Monday.

135
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:56,205
Rym: I wanted to talk about how Technology and the Internet and society have moved so fast that Nothing we have in place nothing modern all the new stuff we use almost everything in our lives has no way to deal with us Dying like right now.

136
00:08:56,265 --> 00:08:57,830
Rym: It was the computer doesn't care.

137
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:01,140
Rym: computers never gonna die exactly so like weird stuff.

138
00:09:01,361 --> 00:09:03,411
Scott: So I think no one wants to install that.

139
00:09:03,491 --> 00:09:13,900
Scott: because imagine going into your like You know settings and it says click here if this person is dead and seeing that there Everyone no one believes they're gonna die even though they know they're gonna die.

140
00:09:14,501 --> 00:09:17,816
Scott: I mean even us are hoping for our ghost in the shell brain uploads.

141
00:09:18,097 --> 00:09:20,552
Scott: We're like no We don't need to have a death option on tweets.

142
00:09:20,613 --> 00:09:21,660
Scott: I'm gonna upload my brain.

143
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,869
Rym: I know there's a moment of the venture.

144
00:09:22,889 --> 00:09:24,200
Rym: brothers were a guy.

145
00:09:24,342 --> 00:09:28,040
Rym: There's a there's a wizard guy And he says something like like what would you like?

146
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,389
Rym: What do you want to do if you want to really hurt someone?

147
00:09:29,409 --> 00:09:36,217
Rym: he's like I'll tell me the exact moment of their death And then later on like way later another episode a guy's being kind of a dick, and he just turns to him.

148
00:09:36,278 --> 00:09:41,219
Rym: He's like Three years eight months one day from now of an aneurysm, and the guy's like what?

149
00:09:41,787 --> 00:09:45,946
Scott: Mm-hmm but Great next week skiing.

150
00:09:46,167 --> 00:09:46,869
Rym: Yeah, actually.

151
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:47,772
Rym: I'm skiing on Saturday.

152
00:09:47,933 --> 00:09:48,956
Scott: That's I'm saying so

153
00:09:49,538 --> 00:10:07,619
Rym: that I Don't know really what to say or do about this issue because I don't think it should be an issue In the sense that if you have social media Your own media being reflected back at you is something that you have to sort of expect.

154
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:17,237
Rym: I Mean if you're if tragedy happens in your life And you've uploaded pictures to flicker do you just not go to your own flicker for the next year or two?

155
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,696
Rym: Maybe you do, but then you also shouldn't have gone to Facebook like I don't could.

156
00:10:22,897 --> 00:10:26,940
Scott: I could just be like hey Ram go my flicker and delete any photos of so-and-so.

157
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:30,594
Rym: But isn't that even asking someone to do that could be pretty traumatic.

158
00:10:30,614 --> 00:10:34,428
Rym: in fact that might even say worse like hey Go delete all the pictures of my dead daughter.

159
00:10:34,448 --> 00:10:36,837
Rym: Oh wait like deleting her.

160
00:10:36,857 --> 00:10:39,580
Rym: oh no sadness feels.

161
00:10:40,731 --> 00:10:45,059
Rym: so It's weird to me that people are so mad about this.

162
00:10:45,521 --> 00:10:50,240
Rym: But is that just the privilege of having a tragedy for not having a daughter or one who is dead?

163
00:10:50,401 --> 00:11:04,560
Rym: Yes, having no tragedy in my life Just do people just have to Adapt to the fact that their lives up to this point in social media will be pretty much Constantly reflected back at them like a mirror for the rest of eternity.

164
00:11:05,962 --> 00:11:08,075
Rym: Do we just have to evolve that out of ourselves like?

165
00:11:08,115 --> 00:11:08,960
Rym: I don't know what to do about it?

166
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,833
Scott: Just wait until you face some tragedy, and then bring it up again.

167
00:11:11,853 --> 00:11:13,500
Rym: Yeah, well I could talk about my stepdad.

168
00:11:14,042 --> 00:11:14,844
Rym: There was some tragedy.

169
00:11:15,266 --> 00:11:16,189
Scott: Yeah, he's alive though.

170
00:11:16,349 --> 00:11:18,657
Rym: He is alive, but that's that's still some tragedy.

171
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:21,970
Scott: Yeah Maybe I was a long time ago already.

172
00:11:22,212 --> 00:11:23,198
Rym: Yeah, it was still kickin.

173
00:11:24,621 --> 00:11:38,080
Rym: It's actually impressive for a lot for lying in the desert for an unknown number of hours with his brain leaking out of his skull bleeding in the desert and Then like being found and then hours later still helicopters, and yeah, it's basically a miracle.

174
00:11:38,403 --> 00:11:39,755
Rym: That is the doctor was like.

175
00:11:39,795 --> 00:11:40,319
Rym: that's crazy.

176
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:41,183
Rym: Okay.

177
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:46,459
Rym: So yeah, I thought that was an interesting issue that a lot of people don't think about.

178
00:11:46,559 --> 00:12:04,829
Rym: so Considering that it was just recently said comic week on cyanide and happiness my advice to you is Every time you take a picture, and you post it to Facebook Imagine how you'll feel when that picture is the subject of tragedy.

179
00:12:05,371 --> 00:12:09,100
Rym: I'm sure that will make you completely immune to actual tragedy.

180
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,836
Rym: That's also probably terrible advice stoicism.

181
00:12:12,977 --> 00:12:23,877
Rym: I approve But anyway things of the day while ago.

182
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:26,270
Rym: I tweeted I don't think I made this a thing of the day, but it was just.

183
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:32,240
Rym: it's a very internet video And I'm just gonna describe it because describing it almost makes it seem weirder.

184
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:36,136
Rym: So it's Luna or the Celestia though the main pony the powerful pony for ponies.

185
00:12:36,216 --> 00:12:36,980
Scott: I've made a comeback.

186
00:12:37,522 --> 00:12:38,566
Scott: When's that season for coming?

187
00:12:38,667 --> 00:12:39,209
Rym: Oh my god?

188
00:12:39,229 --> 00:12:40,554
Rym: I think spring it's coming soon.

189
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,419
Scott: There's also you know I completely forgot ponies exist.

190
00:12:43,761 --> 00:12:48,600
Rym: Yeah, because there hasn't been any ponies, and I really want nothing to do with most of the fandom anymore.

191
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,128
Rym: So I gotta just ignore all that stuff.

192
00:12:50,309 --> 00:12:51,535
Scott: I mean the comics don't know.

193
00:12:51,595 --> 00:12:52,540
Rym: well the comics are amazing.

194
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,029
Scott: Maybe if you gave me the comics there go dig him out.

195
00:12:55,089 --> 00:12:55,691
Scott: I lent to you.

196
00:12:55,771 --> 00:12:58,080
Rym: I bought the trades cuz that's just better.

197
00:12:59,043 --> 00:13:02,363
Scott: But I started with the issues Finish with them.

198
00:13:02,443 --> 00:13:04,188
Rym: I can't change, but anyway.

199
00:13:04,428 --> 00:13:06,614
Rym: This is this was a video that I found a while ago.

200
00:13:06,634 --> 00:13:13,510
Rym: That is just princess Celestia lip-syncing to a song called marry France.

201
00:13:13,972 --> 00:13:15,677
Rym: okay by Perry and Kingsley.

202
00:13:15,697 --> 00:13:19,708
Rym: all right and She's got this vibrato hoof going on.

203
00:13:19,788 --> 00:13:26,078
Rym: and then weird motion graphics happen weird recursive It's just weird recursive motion graphics and a vibrato hoof.

204
00:13:26,982 --> 00:13:42,277
Rym: This is that same thing with insanely high production values and an actual good joke at the end Mmm, so I'd say just watch it and hopefully like us you will suddenly be reminded that ponies is coming back relatively soon.

205
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:49,139
Scott: alright, so Rims favorite thing in the world to do is to annoy people with sound.

206
00:13:50,301 --> 00:13:58,439
Scott: He'll make an annoying sound or at least they'll just make sounds and once he finds out that they're annoying someone He's like he's like a dowsing rod.

207
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:05,682
Scott: He's searching for a sound that annoys people and once he homes in on it, and he finds it He says aha.

208
00:14:06,144 --> 00:14:07,708
Scott: I found one that annoys you.

209
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:11,379
Scott: let me repeat it and never stop repeating it.

210
00:14:11,688 --> 00:14:14,890
Scott: Yeah As long as I may lose this is no dude you may not.

211
00:14:15,051 --> 00:14:18,122
Scott: so the problem the thing is he doesn't actually have a dowsing Rod.

212
00:14:18,444 --> 00:14:30,250
Rym: he relies on your body Signaling that you're annoyed and it is you must not signal it is rims gambit because if you express displeasure I know that I'm succeeding and I continue.

213
00:14:31,152 --> 00:14:36,480
Rym: if you tell me you're fine, and it doesn't bother you I trust you, and I trust that you wouldn't lie to me about that.

214
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,129
Rym: So I keep doing it because you obviously don't care.

215
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:42,007
Scott: so if you find us something that can annoy Rym That is like worth more than flat.

216
00:14:42,027 --> 00:14:45,080
Rym: I think Scott actually might have fucking found my kryptonite all right.

217
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,488
Scott: So there's this girl named Lizzie.

218
00:14:46,508 --> 00:14:48,257
Scott: at least that's her stage name.

219
00:14:48,318 --> 00:14:52,940
Scott: Oh my god Her real name is some Korean name and Lizzie is ridiculously.

220
00:14:53,181 --> 00:15:05,093
Scott: She's like the awesomest person so like she was on running man way back for like the earliest days of running man for like some Small number of episodes, but and she's in some kpop group called after school.

221
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:12,951
Scott: That's actually kind of lame, but she's also in the Incredibly awesome kpop group orange caramel, which are the people who do them.

222
00:15:13,292 --> 00:15:15,820
Rym: I just noticed what the title of this video is right.

223
00:15:16,921 --> 00:15:19,933
Scott: She's in that you know the girls who do the fish dance with the sushi.

224
00:15:20,154 --> 00:15:21,419
Scott: Oh, yeah, yeah, she's one of them.

225
00:15:23,202 --> 00:15:25,709
Scott: Yeah, she's also like starting solo stuff.

226
00:15:25,749 --> 00:15:26,812
Scott: She's like all over the place.

227
00:15:26,852 --> 00:15:31,120
Scott: She's crazy awesome, but back in the day She was in some sitcom.

228
00:15:31,662 --> 00:15:36,577
Scott: Then it was basically like think of it like it looks like Saved by the Bell.

229
00:15:36,737 --> 00:15:47,953
Scott: Yeah, it's Superficial it's winning from a distance more like boy meets world like something that would be on like TGIF Way back in the day that kind of sitcom.

230
00:15:47,993 --> 00:15:49,860
Scott: yeah, right for like teens to watch.

231
00:15:50,201 --> 00:15:58,759
Scott: She was on that kind of show way back in the day, and she had a catchphrase, which is I It's a ing I.

232
00:15:59,402 --> 00:16:04,939
Rym: She actually or and she makes like a moe be motion when she does it to write like sideways V.

233
00:16:05,441 --> 00:16:08,274
Scott: So orange caramel actually has a song eyeing right that guess.

234
00:16:08,294 --> 00:16:09,500
Scott: that goes with this catchphrase.

235
00:16:09,883 --> 00:16:11,620
Scott: So you can watch the music video for that if you want.

236
00:16:12,322 --> 00:16:15,574
Scott: Someone went through the sitcom and cut out every part.

237
00:16:15,614 --> 00:16:17,059
Scott: where Lizzie goes I that ET.

238
00:16:18,023 --> 00:16:18,832
Scott: Yes, you should watch.

247
00:16:43,701 --> 00:16:46,691
Scott: Also, it's good for a few situations and internet threads.

248
00:16:46,731 --> 00:16:49,866
Scott: you need to reply to a thread with a good video You know.

249

Scott: There's been.

260
00:17:24,464 --> 00:17:27,200

00:17:27,501 --> 00:17:32,300
Rym: It's like been coming up in places like showing once again that rimmins got are in fact trendsetters.

262
00:17:32,441 --> 00:17:34,480
Scott: Yeah, the the author is like been interviewing.

263
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:38,158
Scott: I didn't even know the author was alive or how old the book was, but I guess it's only from the 70s.

264
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:39,984
Rym: Yeah, it's a recent book.

265
00:17:40,024 --> 00:17:41,068
Rym: Yeah fun fact.

266
00:17:41,489 --> 00:17:56,680
Rym: It was basically couldn't easily be published like some donkey dinky donkey little publisher picked it up and at a limited release in Europe like in London in the UK and Albion and It was insanely popular, but it sold out because it was a tiny little print run

267
00:17:56,841 --> 00:17:57,506
Scott: And then it had a real

268
00:17:57,546 --> 00:17:57,727
Rym: print.

269
00:17:57,808 --> 00:17:59,500
Rym: it had a real print run in the US.

270
00:18:00,302 --> 00:18:06,260
Rym: So most people in Europe and the UK read it as an imported book from America.

271
00:18:06,762 --> 00:18:08,973
Scott: Interesting look how myself we're learning.

00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:22,360
Rym: No, are you anywhere near getting even like a percent?

277
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:29,446
Scott: I read a few chapters, but I'm less than halfway, but you framed what you just said as Check out this good thing.

00:18:35,503 --> 00:18:37,713
Scott: Well, I was waiting just because I was waiting for something else.

281
00:18:37,733 --> 00:18:48,340
Scott: I wasn't there to buy a book Jesus Christ yeah, and I was looking in the nerdy book section and I saw some books that on the shelf that I recognized to my eye.

282
00:18:49,181 --> 00:18:53,120
Scott: Oh, and I said is that danger mode?

283
00:18:53,862 --> 00:18:57,680

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:08,780
Scott: So I'm going to hurry up and get this book club book done so that I can take you to the land of danger.

288
00:19:11,141 --> 00:19:11,924
Scott: That's all I'm saying.

289
00:19:11,945 --> 00:19:12,567
Rym: Okay.

294
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:32,760

Rym: Okay, I was just about to say it's been again.

Scott: Yeah quite the opposite.

325
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:28,600
Rym: It's bad for people who suck at Megaman games.

326
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,812
Rym: I guess I don't want to be easy.

327
00:21:30,852 --> 00:21:32,179
Scott: as far as Megaman games go.

328
00:21:32,561 --> 00:21:34,970

Scott: Well, don't try to play Megaman X like harder You know what?

330
00:21:37,981 --> 00:21:42,459

331
00:21:43,501 --> 00:21:44,665
Scott: That's what most people watch.

00:21:44,726 --> 00:21:48,400
Rym: a let's play a Megaman one if you really want to know what guts man's power gives you.

00:21:48,461 --> 00:21:49,258
Rym: It's not that great.

334
00:21:52,047 --> 00:21:55,230
Rym: So The predator the predator.

335
00:21:55,311 --> 00:21:56,900
Scott: so I got to tell the story about the predator.

336
00:21:58,282 --> 00:22:04,978
Scott: So way back in high school days, you know You could choose classes and I chose sci-fi class because I was a nerd and it wasn't.

337
00:22:05,059 --> 00:22:07,832
Scott: you know Sci-fi class was pretty much read some sci-fi books.

338
00:22:08,033 --> 00:22:08,435
Scott: I got here.

339
00:22:08,475 --> 00:22:09,440
Rym: you're led the predator.

340
00:22:09,823 --> 00:22:12,219
Rym: This article is about the album by rapper ice cube.

341
00:22:13,761 --> 00:22:16,308
Rym: For other uses see predator disambiguation.

342
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:17,050
Rym: Yeah, I go on.

343
00:22:17,472 --> 00:22:21,963
Scott: so in that class, you know, it wasn't like an honors literature class It was just a regular literature class.

344
00:22:22,003 --> 00:22:29,338
Scott: So there were people in there of various intellectual, you know levels and You know, there was some kids in the corner.

345
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:35,144
Scott: they like to make trouble because they're trouble making kids and they were always just like the Predator.

346
00:22:35,365 --> 00:22:38,539
Scott: they had the catchphrase like the predator and they said it a lot.

347
00:22:39,523 --> 00:22:41,251
Rym: I would just say that all the time.

348
00:22:41,432 --> 00:22:43,180
Scott: Yeah, it caught on with the rest of the class.

349
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:47,940
Scott: It was pretty fun and they try to wedge the predator in like to other conversations.

350
00:22:48,161 --> 00:22:54,120
Scott: They'd be like like we were talking about HG Wells the invisible man, and yeah, it turned invisible like the predator.

351
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:56,902
Scott: You know shit like that.

352
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:57,763
Scott: what happened in class?

353
00:22:57,864 --> 00:23:01,989
Scott: pretty much the whole semester or ever long the semester of high school was.

354
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:07,540
Scott: and Then that you know, they'd also, you know pester the teacher like can we watch the predator?

355
00:23:08,102 --> 00:23:13,768
Scott: Right and at the end of class like it was like the last day of class Teacher let us watch the predator.

356
00:23:14,009 --> 00:23:15,514
Scott: We watched the predator the end.

357
00:23:15,876 --> 00:23:16,980
Scott: All right, and it was awesome.

358
00:23:17,061 --> 00:23:20,060
Rym: Hey, you realize got the movie is just called predator boo.

359
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:29,908
Rym: The predator is just the alien in the predator not to be confused with the alien in Alien, not the alien.

360
00:23:29,928 --> 00:23:32,115
Rym: Yeah, it's funny how they pulled them.

361
00:23:32,155 --> 00:23:33,580
Rym: there is aliens the sequel.

362
00:23:33,901 --> 00:23:36,088
Rym: There is also a movie called predators.

363
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:37,051
Scott: Don't watch that movie.

364
00:23:37,071 --> 00:23:40,644
Rym: Don't watch any predator movie other than Predator.

365
00:23:40,804 --> 00:23:44,279
Scott: so it's weird how predator and alien got like combined to the same universe.

366
00:23:45,042 --> 00:23:48,892
Scott: Part of it is because in predator 2 on the predators ship.

367
00:23:48,912 --> 00:23:53,407
Scott: There is an alien skull which wasn't just an I'm sorry I'm sorry a xenomorph skull.

368
00:23:53,548 --> 00:23:54,874
Rym: Yeah, so Scott.

369
00:23:54,894 --> 00:24:02,320
Rym: Here's the question for you Where if ever in any alien movie when was the first time the word xenomorph was ever said?

370
00:24:03,043 --> 00:24:04,067
Rym: By a character?

371
00:24:04,589 --> 00:24:13,359
Rym: I cannot recall even one I don't think anyway But that's the yeah like you see an alien skull hanging out on the predator ship which writes like awesome.

372
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:14,864
Rym: as a kid I was like oh, it's like.

373
00:24:14,984 --> 00:24:19,780
Scott: that is the only other than until the movies like alien verse predator, right?

374
00:24:20,284 --> 00:24:31,483
Scott: I there was no connection between these two But it's like there was friggin alien verse predator video games for the arcade and Super Nintendo way back in the 90s and it's like That.

375
00:24:31,543 --> 00:24:33,471
Scott: was that just because the predator - like?

376
00:24:33,491 --> 00:24:35,860
Scott: I don't know how the whole connection got started between these.

377
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,763
Rym: I think it shows you.

378
00:24:36,783 --> 00:24:43,547
Scott: is it just because they came out around similar timeframes and we're about dangerous alien life forms That they sort of merged the same way?

379
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:46,860
Scott: that like Freddy and Jason have nothing to fuck to do with each other, right?

380
00:24:47,181 --> 00:24:49,354
Scott: But then they just think horror movies that came out in the 80s.

381
00:24:49,394 --> 00:24:50,240
Scott: Let's stick them together guys.

382
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:57,468
Rym: Well, I mean look today at the fan mashup culture of things That's just in the days before internet.

383
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:03,900
Rym: if a movie studio or a creative team was like hey Why don't we mash up these two current and popular properties?

384
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:04,942
Scott: How did they not?

385
00:25:05,304 --> 00:25:09,560
Scott: these same people who were doing this alien predator mashup and Freddy Jason mashup?

386
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,059
Scott: How do hum they never managed to do Star Wars Star Trek mashup?

387
00:25:13,361 --> 00:25:15,956
Scott: That is the most obvious of all mashups because they don't line up.

388
00:25:15,977 --> 00:25:19,049
Scott: very well I know but even nerds have not dare.

389
00:25:19,089 --> 00:25:21,457
Scott: It's like there's some sort of wall down the middle.

390
00:25:21,558 --> 00:25:23,444
Rym: there is You know what?

391
00:25:23,525 --> 00:25:26,475
Rym: It's because the ships are slow versus moving.

392
00:25:26,495 --> 00:25:28,690
Scott: Yeah Star Wars ships fuck.

393
00:25:33,421 --> 00:25:38,042
Scott: Enterprise is sitting still next to like the Death Star and then like a million x-wings come at it It's like oh my god.

394
00:25:38,464 --> 00:25:41,035
Rym: Yeah, you know, you know who wins that fight the culture ships.

395
00:25:41,538 --> 00:25:41,738
Scott: Yeah.

396
00:25:42,804 --> 00:25:48,068
Rym: So predator I saw as a little kid But I actually saw a Robocop first.

397
00:25:48,268 --> 00:25:55,312
Rym: in terms of like this like movies that were violent in that era of my childhood I don't remember the first time I saw my elementary school saw predator.

398
00:25:55,814 --> 00:25:57,500
Rym: like before I saw predator.

399
00:25:57,601 --> 00:26:03,695
Scott: I don't remember when I saw it or the first time I saw it, but it was on TV I saw and I mistook it for command like.

400
00:26:03,755 --> 00:26:04,500
Rym: I'm confused.

401
00:26:04,621 --> 00:26:10,444
Scott: So someone figure out like what year predator was on like weekend afternoon TV.

402
00:26:10,545 --> 00:26:12,220
Rym: that's the thing until I became a teenager.

403
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:15,372
Rym: I can't base when I saw a movie by the year it came out.

404
00:26:15,412 --> 00:26:18,184
Rym: I can base when I saw a movie by when it Was on HBO.

405
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,114
Scott: Oh, maybe I got on VHS from blockbuster.

406
00:26:20,134 --> 00:26:20,938
Scott: That's also possible.

407
00:26:20,998 --> 00:26:26,900
Rym: might have Yeah, but like as a little kid, I mixed up predator and commando because I didn't really know like what they were.

408
00:26:27,181 --> 00:26:29,029
Scott: I didn't like the first time I saw predator.

409
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:31,519
Scott: I was not conscious enough to fully comprehend this movie.

410
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:34,449
Scott: Yeah, even though it's not a very complicated movie whatsoever.

411
00:26:34,469 --> 00:26:35,673
Scott: I was very young.

412
00:26:35,693 --> 00:26:36,977
Rym: It's interesting cuz Robocop.

413
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:39,370
Rym: I Like the straightforward parts.

414
00:26:39,551 --> 00:26:40,497
Rym: I got a hundred percent.

415
00:26:40,537 --> 00:26:46,103
Rym: as a little kid I was like, alright, he is a guy who got hurt and they turn him into a robot cop and now he's awesome And he saves the day.

416
00:26:46,123 --> 00:26:53,110
Rym: I didn't get the subtext about gender equality in the future or Union or buying things for a dollar.

417
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:59,909
Rym: I got that because I Understood that cuz I had seen running man Played some Smash TV.

418
00:26:59,989 --> 00:27:01,579
Rym: Yeah big money.

419
00:27:03,763 --> 00:27:15,740
Rym: But I remember specifically that I saw the cover of predator somewhere That image of like the target or the reticle on Arnold and I was like, whoa, that's the guy who was in Terminator.

420
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:18,851
Rym: Oh shit, you know Terminator 1 I was talking about.

421
00:27:18,892 --> 00:27:19,976
Rym: I saw Terminator 1 before.

422
00:27:20,036 --> 00:27:22,452
Rym: I saw Terminator 2 like intelligent versus.

423
00:27:22,512 --> 00:27:30,269
Rym: yeah Terminator 1 is just a horror movie basically and You know what watching predator again as an adult.

424
00:27:30,509 --> 00:27:31,673
Rym: I'm gonna be very honest.

425
00:27:32,595 --> 00:27:33,859
Rym: It is not a great movie.

426
00:27:34,381 --> 00:27:35,845
Scott: However, I would never said it was great.

427
00:27:35,926 --> 00:27:37,330
Scott: However, it's not alien.

428
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:40,520
Rym: It is definitely an enjoyable movie.

429
00:27:40,881 --> 00:27:42,025
Scott: It is a good movie.

430
00:27:42,346 --> 00:27:43,349
Scott: It is on the good level.

431
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:44,774
Scott: It is not like Die Hard where it's like.

432
00:27:44,814 --> 00:27:46,540
Scott: whoa is a must-see movie.

433
00:27:47,461 --> 00:27:48,405
Scott: But it you know, it's good.

434
00:27:48,646 --> 00:27:49,389
Scott: You should watch it.

435
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:55,429
Scott: It's not like there's any bad parts, but everyone fixate Doesn't have to the chopper right to the chopper.

436
00:27:55,469 --> 00:27:55,790
Rym: That's all.

437
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:56,713
Rym: anyone knows this movie.

438
00:27:56,773 --> 00:27:57,375
Scott: It says it once.

439
00:27:58,077 --> 00:28:03,860
Scott: they just said twice Yeah, but once it once is not the one time he says it is not quite as in a that's yet.

440
00:28:04,021 --> 00:28:05,070

441
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:08,819
Rym: Scott and I had both seen the movie Like I had seen it when I was a little kid and I hadn't seen it since then.

442
00:28:09,401 --> 00:28:14,215

450
00:28:40,276 --> 00:28:41,360
Rym: and now I look at him.

451
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,226
Scott: I was like true.

452
00:28:42,246 --> 00:28:46,508
Rym: I was like if I see a guy like that on the subway I'm not turning my back on him.

453
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:48,455
Rym: Nor am I going anywhere near him.

454
00:28:48,696 --> 00:28:49,860
Scott: Both of those things are true.

455
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:51,760
Scott: He is so cool and so scary.

456
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:55,940
Rym: But the other thing is that the acting was not subtle in a lot of parts.

457
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,790
Scott: No, the opening of the goddamn movie is like.

458
00:28:58,831 --> 00:29:01,280
Scott: you might as well be a daytime cop drama.

459
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:08,785
Rym: Yeah, it's like Carl Arnold and Carl Weathers have their bonding moment and then they show off their muscles to be like Yeah, these guys don't have muscles.

460
00:29:08,805 --> 00:29:13,740
Scott: He's like, you know some Star Wars Han Solo acting level like you son of a gun.

461
00:29:15,182 --> 00:29:19,136
Rym: But again that kind of dialogue when I was my age was single digits was amazing.

462
00:29:19,377 --> 00:29:22,784
Scott: It's still amazing But there's.

463
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:26,318
Scott: it's not high brow, but it's like well done low brow.

464
00:29:26,438 --> 00:29:29,390
Rym: there's Surprisingly some subtle.

465
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:36,720
Rym: I don't want to say acting but Storycraft and character development in predator that I did not pick up on as a kid.

466
00:29:37,266 --> 00:29:38,500
Rym: So look at how this movie goes.

467
00:29:39,025 --> 00:29:39,854
Rym: It is well.

468
00:29:39,874 --> 00:29:41,885
Rym: first Well, forget the alien part.

469
00:29:42,507 --> 00:29:50,874
Rym: if you just if they cut out that beginning and you didn't know there was an alien yeah, the first half of the movie is super competent.

470
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:56,220
Rym: people Doing their super competent like we are ultra commandos doing our thing.

471
00:29:56,461 --> 00:30:06,279
Rym: Yep, and you see like and he's not they're not a hit squad They're rescuing people and like they all get each other like you see these characters and you see that like they all work together They get each other.

472
00:30:06,581 --> 00:30:13,500
Rym: The only tension at all is between them and Carl Weathers because he is the guy who's out of the game.

473
00:30:14,083 --> 00:30:20,591
Rym: And they show that to you in the beginning because when they do the little arm wrestle Arnold wins because Arnold's still in the game.

474
00:30:20,611 --> 00:30:21,876
Rym: He got out of the game.

475
00:30:21,916 --> 00:30:24,184
Rym: He's wearing a tie He's a bureaucrat.

476
00:30:24,224 --> 00:30:27,013
Rym: now guys in ties who are bureaucrats can't be trusted.

477
00:30:27,234 --> 00:30:27,876
Rym: Oh sure enough.

478
00:30:27,916 --> 00:30:29,260
Rym: He can't be trusted, right?

479
00:30:29,341 --> 00:30:30,792
Scott: It's in a tennis style thing right.

480
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:31,720
Scott: you win this battle.

481
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,124
Scott: It means something right.

482
00:30:33,205 --> 00:30:37,238
Scott: Arnold also wins because he's in the rescuing people game, right?

483
00:30:37,298 --> 00:30:37,960
Scott: He's a good guy.

484
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,963
Scott: He doesn't do like.

485
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,852
Scott: he's not a murderer goes in and like hoses people down.

486
00:30:41,953 --> 00:30:44,100
Scott: Yeah, but Carl is yep.

487
00:30:44,722 --> 00:30:49,919
Rym: But then and and they're super competent and they don't lose their cool for anything.

488
00:30:50,099 --> 00:31:00,830
Rym: Yeah until the alien comes so a character experiences some weird shit and That character is fucked up for the rest of the movie because these characters are master Keaton professionals.

489
00:31:01,272 --> 00:31:05,490
Rym: So when they encounter the alien one by one they go crazy.

490
00:31:06,132 --> 00:31:20,590
Scott: Yeah, so it's if you think about the most the most similar story to this is most dangerous game right and most dangerous game is About you know this guy who gets trapped on an island where the guy who's hunting him for sport And the thing is the guy who gets trapped on the island isn't a total badass.

491
00:31:21,092 --> 00:31:24,203
Scott: But then again, he's just being hunted by a human hunter.

492
00:31:24,564 --> 00:31:30,730
Scott: so like the disparity of Skill level it's like the hunter has to be stronger than the hunted.

493
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:33,603
Scott: But it's like how much stronger right?

494
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:43,590
Scott: if it's too much stronger Then it's really boring because it's like it would be unbelievable for the hunter to do anything But immediately kill their prey in a boring and you know not exciting way.

495
00:31:44,252 --> 00:31:47,063
Scott: But if the hunter is too weak, then it's not scary enough.

496
00:31:47,665 --> 00:31:54,530
Scott: So most dangerous game It's normal dude versus professional hunting dude, so what predator does is ramps it the fuck up.

497
00:31:54,630 --> 00:32:06,848
Scott: It's like well if we want to have the hunted be the most badass humans ever Then we need to make the hunter the most badass alien we can imagine and that way it'll actually be scary and the.

498
00:32:07,209 --> 00:32:12,727
Scott: you know The disparity in strength will be such that there is an entertainment tension horror etc.

499
00:32:13,871 --> 00:32:23,890
Rym: Yep, but you see like as they go crazy like the famous scenes the I am firing my minigun until it runs out of bullets And it runs out of bullets, and then the gun just they're going.

500
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:31,680
Rym: Yeah, like those scenes, and it's the the movie set up to where that would not have happened.

501
00:32:32,121 --> 00:32:37,525
Rym: But for the fact that that guy was fucked up by what's going on around him like he went crazy Even the moat.

502
00:32:37,545 --> 00:32:39,332
Scott: that's how dangerous the predator is right.

503
00:32:39,413 --> 00:32:42,006
Scott: It's but they show you except You can't see.

504
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:52,095
Scott: so right, but it's like they don't show you Necessarily like like an alien like you get scared of the alien because you saw it burst out of a chest And you know do all kind you know.

505
00:32:52,740 --> 00:33:00,765
Scott: but and because it's dark and spooky like you can't tell where it is and they get you with like the cat and stuff like that in Predator it's like the predator.

506
00:33:00,805 --> 00:33:01,829
Scott: isn't really that scary.

507
00:33:01,869 --> 00:33:03,153
Scott: It's actually like an intelligent.

508
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:04,257
Rym: It's just dangerous.

509
00:33:04,297 --> 00:33:04,458
Rym: Yeah.

510
00:33:04,478 --> 00:33:05,604
Scott: He's just like hi How you doing?

511
00:33:05,624 --> 00:33:07,940
Scott: You know he can talk in a language?

512
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:12,260
Scott: That's not English, and you know he has technology flew in a spaceship, right?

513
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,850
Scott: It's not like this sort of dangerous wild animal thing.

514
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:17,134
Scott: It's sort of like hi there.

515
00:33:17,435 --> 00:33:18,077
Scott: I'm the predator.

516
00:33:18,238 --> 00:33:18,900
Scott: I'm hunting you.

517
00:33:19,261 --> 00:33:23,036
Scott: I just happen to be a really awesome alien with crazy awesome homing guns and shit like that.

518
00:33:23,337 --> 00:33:37,700
Scott: Yeah, so To make it scary first they give it this you know cloaking technology which in the one hand Demonstrates that the vastly superior technological capabilities of the predator it also allows them to conceal the predators.

519
00:33:38,181 --> 00:33:42,595
Scott: You know image for you know see the viewer of the movie doesn't know what it looks like.

520
00:33:42,655 --> 00:33:48,477
Scott: at the same time the bad Asses have a hard time shooting at it because they can't see it because it's all camo and whatnot.

521
00:33:49,099 --> 00:33:49,320
Scott: all right.

522
00:33:49,401 --> 00:33:55,819
Scott: So it's like it's an awesome Thing that they can use like for plot reasons and also cinematic reasons at the same time.

523
00:33:56,362 --> 00:34:05,657
Scott: And it sort of like defines the predator the fact that he's got ghost in the shell You know Inviso camo technology, and yeah the effects other than the practical ones like the other effects.

524
00:34:05,778 --> 00:34:06,520
Rym: Don't really hold up.

525
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,505
Rym: Spaceship looks way shit.

526
00:34:09,525 --> 00:34:14,040
Scott: spaceship looks shit, but the camo actually looks pretty good considering the time that they made it true.

527
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:17,715
Rym: I mean it looks better than attempted efforts at similar things in that era.

528
00:34:17,815 --> 00:34:19,984
Scott: and the predators costume You know pretty good.

529
00:34:20,606 --> 00:34:22,533
Scott: No real not really worse than the alien one.

530
00:34:22,773 --> 00:34:23,576
Rym: Yeah, definitely.

531
00:34:23,596 --> 00:34:24,319
Scott: There's nothing wrong with it.

532
00:34:25,764 --> 00:34:27,194
Scott: You know the explosions typical.

533
00:34:27,697 --> 00:34:33,820
Rym: you know Everyone's got a billion bullets and you know typical action movie stuff.

534
00:34:34,263 --> 00:34:36,820
Rym: But everyone always quotes get to the choppa.

535
00:34:37,902 --> 00:34:40,014
Rym: It's like everyone forgot about gonna.

536
00:34:40,054 --> 00:34:40,920
Rym: Have me some fun.

537
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:44,120
Rym: Go ahead me which might be my favorite line actually from the predator.

538
00:34:44,281 --> 00:34:44,886
Rym: Go ahead me some.

539
00:34:44,926 --> 00:34:46,600
Scott: it's much more useful than get to the chopper.

540
00:34:46,761 --> 00:34:51,420
Scott: It's like I guess if you're at a store and need to get to the car, but I get to the chopper.

541
00:34:51,702 --> 00:34:59,750
Scott: Yeah, like there's a lot of times Or you're gonna have you some fun like you're walking in like let's play a board game You sit down to play a board game like I'm gonna.

542
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:00,494
Scott: Have me some fun.

543
00:35:00,976 --> 00:35:01,680
Scott: I'll go have me some.

544
00:35:03,084 --> 00:35:03,325
Scott: You know.

545
00:35:03,346 --> 00:35:04,393
Scott: sit down to record a podcast.

546
00:35:04,433 --> 00:35:05,259
Scott: I'll go have me some fun.

547
00:35:05,501 --> 00:35:07,274
Scott: Yeah, you can use that all.

548
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:08,039
Scott: goddamn day.

549
00:35:08,601 --> 00:35:17,920
Rym: I mean the characters in general - like I I love the characters in this movie because they're all like big muscle dudes and two of them ended up being governors of states.

550
00:35:19,162 --> 00:35:20,767
Rym: Like think about that for a second.

551
00:35:21,089 --> 00:35:23,397
Rym: I forgot Jesse Ventura was in this movie.

552
00:35:23,598 --> 00:35:25,343
Scott: Yep He was.

553
00:35:25,784 --> 00:35:29,093
Rym: so all we need is for Carl Weathers to run for governor.

554
00:35:29,113 --> 00:35:29,875
Scott: is he alive.

555
00:35:29,896 --> 00:35:32,783
Rym: He was in Arrested Development That long ago.

556
00:35:32,803 --> 00:35:33,365
Rym: all right.

557
00:35:33,686 --> 00:35:34,087
Rym: He played.

558
00:35:34,347 --> 00:35:38,660
Rym: He's he's joined the cadre of actors who played themselves as washed-up actors.

559
00:35:40,623 --> 00:35:42,069
Rym: Did you get to that partner as the development?

560
00:35:42,571 --> 00:35:43,957
Scott: I only saw it we saw at the beach.

561
00:35:44,238 --> 00:35:55,877
Rym: so basically He's just like the sort of con man washed-up actor playing himself And he like uses his fame to get people to like buy him food and things and it's just actually funny.

562
00:35:55,917 --> 00:35:58,403
Rym: no That's so.

563
00:35:58,664 --> 00:36:00,409
Rym: you're such a superficial fan.

564
00:36:00,669 --> 00:36:02,474
Rym: all you know is the banana stand joke.

565
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:03,537
Rym: you don't know any other jokes.

566
00:36:04,018 --> 00:36:04,620
Rym: get to the job.

567
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:14,251
Rym: Also movie Definitely proud of his time kind of got away with having the.

568
00:36:14,653 --> 00:36:26,180
Rym: this is the Native American character And this is the nerd character And this is the cowboy character, and this is Arnold the hero who wins with mud.

569
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:27,725
Scott: Here's the girl.

570
00:36:27,745 --> 00:36:32,179
Scott: yep, we introduced because otherwise there wouldn't be any girl in this movie.

571
00:36:34,121 --> 00:36:35,584
Scott: But yeah the predator is like.

572
00:36:35,905 --> 00:36:46,400
Scott: you know it's weird that like from this pretty simple straightforward movie like this whole like like Franchise a predator like spawned out of this it like it's like whoa.

573
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:56,465
Scott: It's like I guess it's because like you have this one alien that clearly came from a race of aliens because it has technology Yeah, you know and it came to earth.

574
00:36:57,007 --> 00:37:00,818
Scott: It's like so that sort of leaves this huge unexplained.

575
00:37:01,179 --> 00:37:06,200
Scott: You know Universe out there to build upon and that's what allows them to create.

576
00:37:06,586 --> 00:37:15,983
Scott: You know the entire Universe of predator and also the anything had just been like a wild animal that was living in the jungle the whole time That they wouldn't have been able to do anything else with it And we probably wouldn't have.

577
00:37:16,505 --> 00:37:24,467
Rym: you know the same kind of it also set up a bunch of things about how like the predator had Been to earth before And had been hunting before.

578
00:37:24,749 --> 00:37:27,060
Rym: yeah cuz similar things that happened in the past.

579
00:37:27,722 --> 00:37:32,080
Rym: So there's a lot to do there, and you know like his ship is somewhere.

580
00:37:33,121 --> 00:37:33,565
Scott: That's true.

581
00:37:33,787 --> 00:37:44,111
Rym: like they could have made a movie that was like hey We found the predator ship and then it could have been good instead of bad But a few or maybe his ship is self-destructed.

582
00:37:44,131 --> 00:37:46,019
Rym: when he's self-destructed yeah, it's hard to say yeah.

583
00:37:46,662 --> 00:37:53,373
Rym: But one thing I've noticed is that a lot of people who talk about this movie Complain because Terminator 2 you weren't like.

584
00:37:53,655 --> 00:37:54,860
Scott: Terminator 2 is 10,000.

585
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:55,971
Rym: No I'm saying you weren't.

586
00:37:56,234 --> 00:38:02,800
Rym: you weren't Originally intended to know that Arnold plays the good guy and all the trailers like everything about the movie ruined that for everybody.

587
00:38:03,402 --> 00:38:08,079
Rym: The matrix actually somehow got away with like that not being ruined in the very beginning.

588
00:38:08,964 --> 00:38:13,260
Rym: predator Just from the very beginning of the movie shows you the alien ship.

589
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,326
Rym: That's the first scene.

590
00:38:14,427 --> 00:38:16,640
Scott: is this alien dropship going like going earth?

591
00:38:16,881 --> 00:38:22,501
Rym: I've seen people complain saying that the movie would have been better if it didn't show you that and you didn't know what the deal Was.

592
00:38:22,542 --> 00:38:24,251
Scott: the same people get upset at spoilers.

593
00:38:24,613 --> 00:38:31,699
Rym: nah because in this case Seeing the ship ahead of time in my opinion means it puts you in that tense situation.

594
00:38:31,739 --> 00:38:31,940
Rym: where?

595
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,078
Rym: You know shit's about to go down.

596
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:38,400
Rym: You know there's this sort of Damocles just like hanging above the characters.

597
00:38:38,862 --> 00:38:40,089
Rym: But the characters don't know it.

598
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:43,212
Scott: people put too much value on Surprise.

599
00:38:43,435 --> 00:38:50,676
Rym: no I still agree with my bullshit, and I disagree with it.

600
00:38:50,736 --> 00:38:52,260
Rym: I'm glad you agree that it's bullshit.

601
00:38:52,381 --> 00:38:53,752
Scott: I'm gonna keep saying it cuz 100% true nope.

602
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:59,696
Scott: But here's people just want cheap thrills and surprise and can't appreciate something.

603
00:38:59,797 --> 00:39:09,307
Rym: in Terminator 2 Not knowing would have made the early scenes filled with more attention not less Because that early scene would be.

604
00:39:09,327 --> 00:39:17,159
Rym: there are all these people and they're all coming after John Connor And they're all evil and you don't know what's going on.

605
00:39:17,541 --> 00:39:21,960
Rym: And then the reveal is an interesting twist and then the movie just shoots like a rocket out of that point.

606
00:39:22,341 --> 00:39:39,817
Rym: knowing Arnold's the good guy takes some tension away, but in predator if the if the predator had attacked them right away Then it would have been like Terminator less tense, but because the predator doesn't attack them for a long time The longer he doesn't attack them the more tension you feel.

607
00:39:39,837 --> 00:39:41,343
Scott: that is true You know like.

608
00:39:41,383 --> 00:39:45,515
Scott: there's nothing in the movie besides that alien dropship scene at the very very beginning.

609
00:39:46,017 --> 00:39:47,764
Scott: if you cut that out They don't.

610
00:39:48,025 --> 00:39:51,000
Scott: there's no predator action for quite a while.

611
00:39:51,161 --> 00:39:56,160
Scott: So it's like you would just be thinking - you would go that whole beginning part of the movie.

612
00:39:56,581 --> 00:40:01,479
Scott: You would actually be thinking about like the commando guys that they're going to go and do it.

613
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:06,180
Rym: You might be thinking that maybe this thing that's attacking them is the government secret, right?

614
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,819
Scott: You'd think that like that's what the movie's about.

615
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:16,725
Scott: is You know going to take out these bad guys in the jungle like it's commando or something like that and like you know You wouldn't you know?

616
00:40:16,745 --> 00:40:19,377
Scott: and then when the alien came like where the fuck did that come from?

617
00:40:19,457 --> 00:40:20,100
Scott: and you know?

618
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,486
Scott: It'd be it would be a total mess.

619
00:40:22,049 --> 00:40:27,010
Scott: I mean, I guess you could change around the whole movie But you need some kind of force to do it.

620
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:27,754
Rym: Here's what you have to do.

621
00:40:27,855 --> 00:40:28,820
Rym: It was foreshadowed.

622
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,990
Rym: They could have done it both ways cuz they did it that needed.

623
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:34,350
Scott: you need to replace that foreshadowing with a different No, no, cuz look at the movie.

624
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:36,885
Rym: There's there's obviously Carl Weathers.

625
00:40:37,287 --> 00:40:38,511
Rym: Dylan has a plus Dylan right?

626
00:40:38,532 --> 00:40:39,375
Rym: I already forget all that.

627
00:40:39,656 --> 00:40:40,620
Scott: I don't know anyone's name.

628
00:40:41,162 --> 00:40:42,346
Rym: So you remember who Dutch is?

629
00:40:42,688 --> 00:40:43,410
Scott: that's Arnold?

630
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:52,660
Rym: Yeah, okay, so Carl Weathers He is obviously hiding something and there's obviously like some you know, like there's that whole plot around.

631
00:40:52,961 --> 00:41:02,360
Scott: He's tricking them into going in right but he's tricking them because he he knows Arnold will only go on a rescue mission Wants to get him to go on a murder mission, but he's tricking them to go in on a murder mission.

632
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,275
Rym: That's orthogonal to the alien plot.

633
00:41:04,497 --> 00:41:17,247
Rym: Mm-hmm If you didn't know it was an alien you would think that his trick was This thing that's stalking them like some sort of government project like something and then the twist would have been oh It wasn't the government plot.

634
00:41:17,287 --> 00:41:18,311
Rym: It was this other thing.

635
00:41:18,331 --> 00:41:20,340
Rym: It would have been a very different movie instead.

636
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,905
Rym: So when you evaluate spoil

637
00:41:21,965 --> 00:41:26,900
Scott: you need some scene where like they peek over a hill and see like the ship or something

638
00:41:27,762 --> 00:41:37,679
Rym: Or even just like you see the alien night vision the IR vision and you think that's like the government people Tracking them or whatever like you don't really know what that is.

639
00:41:38,161 --> 00:41:42,480
Scott: Yeah, that's a lot of the movie is you know through the Predators eyes like looking at them.

640
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:46,055
Rym: And so this is why I don't disagree with you 100% of the spoilers thing.

641
00:41:46,115 --> 00:41:47,019
Rym: I don't agree with you 100% either.

642
00:41:47,300 --> 00:42:01,160
Rym: I think in there are situations where spoilers increase tension or increase enjoyment and there are situations Where they decrease tension or decrease enjoyment and it's a matter of story craft and nuance and skill.

643
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:10,012
Rym: But in the case of predator the fact that you know, there's an alien from the opening credits I think is what makes the movie as good as that movie could have been.

644
00:42:10,434 --> 00:42:14,140
Scott: I agree that there are cases where Spoilers can decrease enjoyment.

645
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:20,980
Scott: What I'm saying is that those cases is because the enjoyment to be had is fully or mostly in the form of surprise.

646
00:42:22,082 --> 00:42:34,607
Scott: No enjoyment to be had elsewhere and thus works of art that are relying so heavily on surprise Thus that spoilers truly spoil them are not good works of art and you who cares about spoiling them They're not even worth watching or experiencing.

647
00:42:34,968 --> 00:42:40,154
Scott: something like Empire Strikes Back is not ruined at all By knowing that Darth Vader is Luke's father.

648
00:42:40,194 --> 00:42:41,240
Scott: In fact, it is enhanced.

649
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:49,420
Rym: But as we watch that movie a thousand goddamn times seeing Quality seeing Terminator 2 it was intended and not knowing Arnold is the good guy.

650
00:42:49,821 --> 00:42:52,008
Rym: The surprise is not the big point.

651
00:42:52,309 --> 00:42:59,134
Rym: The point is the tension before the surprise where Like John Connor's fuck the bad guy.

652
00:42:59,174 --> 00:43:00,640
Scott: Have you watched Terminator 2 now?

653
00:43:00,721 --> 00:43:01,920
Scott: It's not as good as the first time.

654
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:02,542
Rym: I'm saying.

655
00:43:02,662 --> 00:43:10,608
Rym: if you saw it and didn't know that Arnold was the good guy the opening scene up until the Moment before the surprise.

656
00:43:10,668 --> 00:43:14,040
Rym: reveal that time forget the surprise take the surprise out of the equation.

657
00:43:14,563 --> 00:43:17,680
Rym: The first chunk of the movie would have been a better experience.

658
00:43:18,702 --> 00:43:20,974
Scott: You don't have that good experience watching it.

659
00:43:21,074 --> 00:43:22,100
Rym: No, I do have a good experience.

660
00:43:22,361 --> 00:43:26,979
Rym: I think it would have been a better experience because the tension would have been ratcheted the fuck up.

661
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:32,235
Scott: I because I because I know that that I'm supposed to think Arnold's the bad guy.

662
00:43:32,656 --> 00:43:36,129
Scott: last time I watched Terminator 2 I can still see all that tension right.

663
00:43:36,149 --> 00:43:37,153
Scott: there is no problem.

664
00:43:37,193 --> 00:43:40,084
Rym: Yeah, you say that but under you're not Ubermensch you're not rust.

665
00:43:40,104 --> 00:43:40,666
Rym: call Nick off.

666
00:43:41,189 --> 00:43:41,811
Scott: I'd had no problem.

667
00:43:41,992 --> 00:43:43,740
Rym: every read the rest of a crime and punishment.

668
00:43:44,601 --> 00:43:46,616
Scott: Listen captain ubermensch Arnold didn't try to rob.

669
00:43:46,656 --> 00:43:49,439
Rym: No, they Didn't have him some fun.

670
00:43:52,107 --> 00:43:57,840
Rym: No predator honestly Of a bunch of people like hanging out like hey, let's watch an old Arnold movie.

671
00:43:58,742 --> 00:44:01,415
Rym: I think commando or running men are a better choice for that environment.

672
00:44:01,455 --> 00:44:04,649
Rym: Yes predator However is a better movie than both of them.

673
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:05,272
Scott: That is true.

674
00:44:05,332 --> 00:44:10,051
Rym: Also and while it has a lot of flaws It's not an unenjoyable movie, but I wouldn't.

675
00:44:10,533 --> 00:44:13,645
Rym: I don't think people should go out of their way to see it Unless they're not old fan.

676
00:44:13,826 --> 00:44:16,014
Scott: I think it's a must-see just in terms.

677
00:44:16,054 --> 00:44:16,536
Rym: It's a must-see.

678
00:44:16,556 --> 00:44:18,506
Rym: if you're a sci-fi movie It's a must-see.

679
00:44:18,547 --> 00:44:19,855
Scott: just that be a nerd right.

680
00:44:19,895 --> 00:44:20,660
Scott: have nerd knowledge.

681
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:29,860
Rym: If you're a nerd if you're a sci-fi movie fan If you're an action sci-fi movie fan, if you're an Arnold movie fan, you mean for a lot of people?

682
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,040
Scott: It's just sort of something like you have to know what the deal with the predator is.

683
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:37,040
Rym: You can't not know that but you could learn that from Wikipedia and which I think most people do.

684
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:38,225
Rym: I think most people know.

685
00:44:38,546 --> 00:44:42,020
Rym: get to the choppa and yeah, that's the Arnold movie with the predator, right?

686
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:45,000
Scott: But you also got to see like the dudes arm falling off still firing a machine.

687
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:45,604
Rym: You know what?

688
00:44:45,624 --> 00:44:47,133
Rym: They see they see animated gifs of that.

689
00:44:47,716 --> 00:44:50,200
Scott: Yeah, it's good You know if you piece it together, whatever.

690
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:58,260
Scott: But 90 minutes isn't really gonna take you to watch the movie isn't really gonna be much faster Yeah, or slower than reading all that internet.

691
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,425
Rym: You know what the real moral is.

692
00:44:59,907 --> 00:45:08,195
Rym: Arnold movies are a specific genre of movie And I really like Arnold movies and I did not stop liking them when I became wise.

693
00:45:08,857 --> 00:45:09,580
Scott: they're not bad.

694
00:45:11,243 --> 00:45:12,740
Rym: I'd buy them for at least a dollar.

695

Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
