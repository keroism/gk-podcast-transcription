00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,452
Rym: It's Thursday, December 10th, 2015.

2
00:00:13,452 --> 00:00:13,973
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:16,600
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:17,069 --> 00:00:19,517
Rym: jobs Every single one of them.

5
00:00:21,101 --> 00:00:34,990
Rym: Let's do this Basically two movies we're gonna see in theaters in the near future because usually it kind of either pirate stuff or wait for it to Come home, or I watch movies on planes a lot.

6
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:39,890
Rym: I mean the last movie I saw in a theater that I was like Deeply invested in seeing in the theater was Fury Road.

7
00:00:40,452 --> 00:00:43,766
Scott: It usually it takes a real lot to get me to go to a movie theater.

8
00:00:43,786 --> 00:00:48,410
Rym: saw the Martian in the theater And I'm glad I did but seeing it at home would have been pretty much as good.

9
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:53,230
Rym: I just wanted to see it, but Fury Road was definitely worth seeing in the theater.

10
00:00:53,551 --> 00:01:04,295
Rym: Yeah, so and if when it comes back to theaters for when you know as like the marathon before Fury Road 2 comes out in a few years I'll go see it in the theater again So I can go see.

11
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:06,666
Scott: there's gonna be Star Wars which is pretty much what it takes.

12
00:01:06,706 --> 00:01:07,530
Scott: you get to me to go to.

13
00:01:08,474 --> 00:01:08,855
Rym: You know what?

14
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:11,365
Rym: I'm not gonna see Star Wars an opening night.

15
00:01:11,687 --> 00:01:12,510
Scott: No, how would I do that?

16
00:01:13,071 --> 00:01:16,044
Rym: I saw I went saw a fucking Phantom Menace opening night.

17
00:01:16,084 --> 00:01:17,429
Scott: You know what I didn't do that either.

18
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:18,854
Scott: It's not like.

19
00:01:18,874 --> 00:01:26,350
Rym: the day or two after might have been worth it if Phantom Menace hadn't been terrible Still cautiously optimistic about Star Wars.

20
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:32,590
Rym: But I'm gonna see it when I can just buy a ticket at the theater that has assigned seating like 84th Street.

21
00:01:32,832 --> 00:01:33,477
Scott: Yeah, it's gonna be.

22
00:01:33,698 --> 00:01:34,343
Scott: you can be able to see.

23
00:01:34,384 --> 00:01:37,421
Scott: it's not going anywhere Right, it's like it's gonna be in that theater for a while.

24
00:01:37,883 --> 00:01:42,209
Scott: You can just go see it If it's good, and you know what if it's bad you can maybe avoid it.

25
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,884
Rym: Yeah, cuz you know what if the like if the initial I don't I mean like.

26
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:47,290
Scott: I have hopes in meaning.

27
00:01:47,471 --> 00:01:50,773
Scott: I want it to be good, but I don't have any expectations.

28
00:01:51,096 --> 00:01:58,078
Rym: my expectation is Probably below average if people I trust see the Star Wars movie and say it's bad.

29
00:01:58,318 --> 00:01:59,500
Rym: I'm not gonna go see it in the theater.

30
00:02:00,518 --> 00:02:02,967
Scott: Uh You know it depends on people.

31
00:02:03,007 --> 00:02:05,215
Rym: I trust Scott like it's certain of our friends.

32
00:02:05,256 --> 00:02:06,400
Scott: I don't trust hardly anybody.

33
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:06,982
Rym: Yeah, what it?

34
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:07,525
Rym: what if?

35
00:02:07,846 --> 00:02:08,107
Scott: oh wait?

36
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:09,895
Scott: Maybe I can trust my one snooty co-worker.

37
00:02:09,914 --> 00:02:10,477
Scott: I can trust him.

38
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:12,664
Rym: No Would you trust me?

39
00:02:12,724 --> 00:02:14,151
Rym: What if I was like it was a garbage movie?

40
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:14,432
Scott: Well?

41
00:02:14,472 --> 00:02:15,999
Scott: I mean you know I don't know.

42
00:02:18,582 --> 00:02:24,000
Rym: But the other movie that we got to get tickets to is the 70 millimeter three hour long.

43
00:02:24,321 --> 00:02:25,848
Scott: Hateful eight right so normally.

44
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:28,240
Scott: I wouldn't go see a Quentin Tarantino movie in the theater.

45
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,550
Scott: I didn't see Inglorious Basterds in the theater.

46
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,032
Rym: well remember.

47
00:02:31,112 --> 00:02:31,915
Rym: I saw Django.

48
00:02:32,016 --> 00:02:33,060
Scott: I didn't see Django in the theater.

49
00:02:33,241 --> 00:02:36,820
Rym: I saw Django in the theater, but I saw it in the shitty Jewish theater in the bad part of Queens.

50
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:42,259
Rym: So that's worse than your home, but no so because that theater is so shitty.

51
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:48,560
Rym: I Thought the movie was kind of out of focus and had this bad film grain on purpose.

52
00:02:49,581 --> 00:02:57,951
Rym: And I did not know that was not true until I saw a YouTube clip of the movie, and I was like oh That was just authentic that wasn't?

53
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,021
Rym: that wasn't on purpose movie I see.

54
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:06,129
Scott: the only movie I saw in that theater the tiny theater and queen in Flushing Main Street is James Bond.

55
00:03:06,169 --> 00:03:09,815
Scott: the world is not enough My grandma when it was near this.

56
00:03:10,036 --> 00:03:15,899
Rym: the only other movie I saw at that theater was the Avatar movie the bad one not that not the blue people one.

57
00:03:16,981 --> 00:03:19,659
Scott: Okay, the only reason I didn't walk out the blue people one is man.

58
00:03:20,042 --> 00:03:23,439
Rym: I liked it was a good movie solid sci-fi ish movie.

59
00:03:23,749 --> 00:03:25,667
Rym: Yeah But no that that avatar movie.

60
00:03:25,687 --> 00:03:31,272
Rym: the only reason I didn't walk out is that I had no way to get home So I needed a ride so I'd wait for the movie to end.

61
00:03:31,453 --> 00:03:37,615
Scott: I found out that one of my Newer co-workers is like a super fan of the blue people avatar like.

62
00:03:37,876 --> 00:03:38,398
Scott: he's like man.

63
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,265
Scott: when that was out I thought it was the coolest thing.

64
00:03:40,325 --> 00:03:41,309
Scott: I was buying stuff.

65
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,378
Scott: It was my wallpaper on my desktop.

66
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,729
Rym: Wow well You know I was kind of like.

67
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:47,920
Scott: I didn't realize anyone was that into that movie.

68
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:48,823
Scott: But I guess someone is.

69
00:03:49,084 --> 00:03:51,312
Rym: it's weird to see someone who's very into like.

70
00:03:51,994 --> 00:04:01,120
Rym: one movie like Mad Max is different Yeah, but like series of movie I guess there's a kind of person who like changes their desktop background ever like every time the newest.

71
00:04:01,401 --> 00:04:06,479
Scott: I mean go see what you know this trailers for right now right pick one of those things this someone who's like.

72
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,700
Scott: I'm like a fan of whatever it is, but Eight I have to see in the theater because it's in 70 millimeter.

73
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,746
Scott: Otherwise I'd wait for it to.

74
00:04:13,947 --> 00:04:14,330
Scott: you know it's like.

75
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:19,099
Scott: I fucking love Quentin Tarantino movies But I don't think I've ever seen any of them in the theater.

76
00:04:19,601 --> 00:04:23,500
Rym: I think I saw Pulp Fiction in the theater, but I don't know if I might have seen Kill Bill in the theater.

77
00:04:23,761 --> 00:04:25,389
Rym: I saw both Kill Bill movies in the theater.

78
00:04:25,429 --> 00:04:28,320
Scott: I might have seen them both, but other than that It's like dude.

79
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:28,983
Scott: I you know.

80
00:04:29,043 --> 00:04:37,461
Scott: they're just fine to watch at home even though Quentin Tarantino is like the biggest freakin You know like vinyl listening film using you know snob hipster Yeah,

81
00:04:37,502 --> 00:04:39,169
Rym: but it's a bad format,

82
00:04:39,269 --> 00:04:40,515
Scott: but the thing is if it's a 70 millimeter

83
00:04:42,001 --> 00:04:43,227
Rym: Not

84
00:04:43,267 --> 00:04:46,279
Scott: like this 70 millimeter, it's not like vinyl records where it's like.

85
00:04:46,299 --> 00:04:47,624
Scott: oh I like that sort of thing.

86
00:04:47,705 --> 00:04:49,753
Scott: right it is just better.

87
00:04:50,034 --> 00:04:53,345
Scott: the film is so big Right and the it is.

88
00:04:53,446 --> 00:04:56,195
Scott: so we aspect ratio is so wide.

89
00:04:56,516 --> 00:05:02,600
Scott: if you watch that at home It's gonna be like this little sliver down the middle of your TV with like these two.

90
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,228
Rym: Yeah, you know what the aspect racing ratio is.

91
00:05:05,348 --> 00:05:09,020
Scott: it's like one to three or so two point seven six to one.

92
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:22,280
Scott: So it's basically one to three yeah, which means you see my guy in order to watch this at home your teeth Imagine you have to have three TVs in a row And it would span it would take full height and it would go all across all three TV.

93
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:28,020
Scott: So if you put it on just one TV the top third and the bottom third of the TV screen are gonna be black.

94
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:30,730
Rym: Yeah, you're gonna have remember letterboxing.

95
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:33,160
Rym: well letterboxing in your yo dog.

96
00:05:33,481 --> 00:05:39,383
Scott: This is why you have to see and you know I think he's gonna release a version that is like digital And isn't.

97
00:05:39,443 --> 00:05:41,154
Scott: but why would you go see that?

98
00:05:41,738 --> 00:05:41,919
Rym: yeah?

99
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:50,980
Scott: Yeah guys, there's not that many showing this To do what I always wanted, which is you know so many Hollywood movies.

100
00:05:51,161 --> 00:05:55,838
Scott: It's like they all make them all 90 minutes because you know people have short attention spans especially adults.

101
00:05:55,878 --> 00:05:59,117
Scott: these days It's fucking three hours motherfucker.

102
00:05:59,157 --> 00:06:02,869
Rym: It's like There is an inner inner mission.

103
00:06:02,989 --> 00:06:03,571
Rym: Thank God.

104
00:06:03,631 --> 00:06:04,533
Scott: It's like dude.

105
00:06:04,634 --> 00:06:05,837
Scott: You know it's like you.

106
00:06:05,857 --> 00:06:06,920
Scott: look at all the great movies.

107
00:06:07,081 --> 00:06:10,755
Scott: It's like most of them are fucking long even the old Star Wars movies like two hours.

108
00:06:10,836 --> 00:06:14,453
Scott: right if I'm not mistaken Lawrence of Arabia like that's a fucking movie.

109
00:06:14,815 --> 00:06:14,996
Scott: right.

110
00:06:15,016 --> 00:06:15,619
Scott: bring it on.

111
00:06:15,921 --> 00:06:19,837
Scott: I don't want to go to the movie theater and pay a fortune to sit there for 90 fucking minutes.

112
00:06:19,877 --> 00:06:21,307
Scott: if I'm going there I want to sit there all.

113
00:06:21,327 --> 00:06:25,495
Rym: goddamn day there might be an upper limit But I think that upper limit for me is got her damn wrong.

114
00:06:25,515 --> 00:06:30,060
Scott: I mean yeah, okay There is definitely an upper limit, which is where if I have to leave to you know P or whatever.

115
00:06:30,161 --> 00:06:32,050
Scott: But if you have two inner missions, I'm still good.

116
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:33,840
Scott: if you need a third then we have a problem.

117
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:35,727
Rym: I just realized I can't.

118
00:06:35,747 --> 00:06:37,453
Scott: I think Lawrence of Arabia has two inner missions.

119
00:06:37,614 --> 00:06:43,060
Rym: the thing is this movie because Tarantino is a fanboy of this stuff is going to use this.

120
00:06:43,763 --> 00:06:46,920
Scott: The trailer already tells you it's gonna be just as good as his previous movies.

121
00:06:47,462 --> 00:06:51,799
Scott: It had a little bit as you have to see this one in the theater because the trailer had a little bit of TV.

122
00:06:51,819 --> 00:07:06,630
Rym: is Tiny that derp act like the certain kind of certain kind of acting that you'd see in like 90s westerns And I feel like it's going for that instead of for like older western style Just the way the actors talk to each other and the way they.

123
00:07:07,273 --> 00:07:07,453
Rym: well.

124
00:07:07,514 --> 00:07:09,140
Rym: We'll review the movie after it comes out.

125
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:09,521
Scott: I don't care.

126
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:11,188
Scott: I can read the cinematography well.

127
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:21,463
Rym: Yeah, because he's such a fanboy this movie You know is going to use every millimeter of that wide format to do Everything.

128
00:07:21,563 --> 00:07:24,532
Scott: so imagine is three hours long and the film is gigantic right.

129
00:07:24,893 --> 00:07:32,015
Scott: I heard that at the places that are actually you know Projecting the film they had to have like teams of people like carry it up the stairs because it weighs.

130
00:07:32,296 --> 00:07:35,063
Rym: they deployed special Cameras.

131
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,400
Scott: well the projectors don't exist in a lot of places.

132
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:45,931
Scott: So they had to like get old projector parts from everywhere They could and like mangled projectors together, and you know if they're gonna go through the effort I'll go through the effort of watching it.

133
00:07:45,991 --> 00:07:48,286
Rym: so if you don't live in a big city You just can't like.

134
00:07:48,326 --> 00:07:50,660
Rym: it's not playing in that many places in that format.

135
00:07:51,022 --> 00:07:51,666
Scott: Get in your car.

136
00:07:51,686 --> 00:07:53,759
Scott: if you don't live in a big city you have a car and you can get to one.

137
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,897
Rym: There's like three or four places doing it in New York, so we're good.

138
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:57,340
Rym: We're good.

139
00:07:58,461 --> 00:08:06,211
Rym: So in the news remember how yeah the last show we talked about how we saw two different people in cars Almost get hit by trains because people can't drive.

140
00:08:06,372 --> 00:08:10,829
Rym: yeah got another train story Boston train on the t-line like.

141
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:13,059
Rym: it's just a little like local commuter train.

142
00:08:14,121 --> 00:08:17,560
Rym: Yeah, well so passengers are on this train like this happened this morning.

143
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:24,094
Scott: So I mean the T is not as a subway But some of it is more commuter rally depending on the line you're on this.

144
00:08:24,174 --> 00:08:29,034
Scott: this was this was a. some of the tees are Actually like buses that are underground, but this one's actually a train train.

145
00:08:29,074 --> 00:08:30,340
Rym: Yeah, so it's like a big subway.

146
00:08:30,481 --> 00:08:36,066
Rym: Okay, so people got on the train, and it takes off Skips its first stop.

147
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:39,179
Scott: is it going like no normal speed normal speed just.

148
00:08:40,605 --> 00:08:42,258
Rym: Then it skips its second stop.

149
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,722
Scott: well I mean, that's a problem.

150
00:08:44,265 --> 00:08:49,120
Scott: so people in the I mean if it skips what the regular subway skips one stop unannounced.

151
00:08:49,482 --> 00:08:54,889
Scott: That's never happened to me and all the years that happened to me once I would push as soon as if that ever happened.

152
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,360
Scott: I would push the emergency talk to the engineer button immediately.

153
00:08:57,561 --> 00:09:04,191
Rym: Yeah, so the only reason I didn't the one time it happened is because the whole crowd starts going rabble rabble rabble like immediately.

154
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,818
Rym: I push the button right away, and then an announcement comes on.

155
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:12,327
Rym: just like ladies and gentlemen due to Bubble bubble we're making stops.

156
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:17,080
Scott: Yeah, yeah, but that's that happens, but if they don't say anything it just skips a stop unannounced.

157
00:09:17,384 --> 00:09:18,540
Scott: I'm pushing that red button immediately.

158
00:09:19,361 --> 00:09:20,566
Rym: People who were in the car.

159
00:09:20,587 --> 00:09:23,520
Rym: that is where the purse the engineer running the train is on car.

160
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:25,290
Rym: Yeah, I assume it's the front car.

161
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:25,853
Scott: I hope so.

162
00:09:25,893 --> 00:09:26,818
Scott: otherwise how could they see?

163
00:09:28,343 --> 00:09:32,611
Rym: They go and start like banging on the door to see what's up And then they realize there is no one in there.

164
00:09:32,631 --> 00:09:34,260
Scott: there the emergency stop.

165
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:35,905
Scott: So if what?

166
00:09:36,186 --> 00:09:41,768
Rym: the thing that everyone pulls for the wrong reason all the time like I got heartburn wait Are you telling me?

167
00:09:41,828 --> 00:09:42,433
Scott: Are you telling me?

168
00:09:42,473 --> 00:09:43,259
Scott: They didn't pull it?

169
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,262
Rym: No one pulled it.

170
00:09:44,302 --> 00:09:45,868
Rym: the central office happened.

171
00:09:46,048 --> 00:09:53,439
Rym: the central office cut power to the track and Stopped the train and then the train was stopped with no power.

172
00:09:53,822 --> 00:09:56,659
Rym: So the people on the train started trying to break windows to get out of it.

173
00:09:56,901 --> 00:09:58,920
Scott: No, aren't they emergency opening windows?

174
00:10:00,361 --> 00:10:08,802
Scott: I just think the moral of the story instructions to how to open the door in an emergency think people in Boston Just might not be that bright Cuz.

175
00:10:09,325 --> 00:10:14,495
Rym: if I were on this train one I would have pulled the emergency break as far as I know.

176
00:10:14,535 --> 00:10:18,694
Scott: if I know there's no engineer I pulled the emergency brake and then I'd be like all right.

177
00:10:18,734 --> 00:10:19,537
Scott: everyone in this car.

178
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:20,020
Scott: listen up.

179
00:10:20,302 --> 00:10:22,700
Scott: Here's the instructions for getting the hell out of here, but I'm in New York.

180
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,340
Rym: I wouldn't need to because everyone in New York would react the exact same way.

181
00:10:26,621 --> 00:10:31,240
Rym: We'd be fucking prying the door open with a little crank and we find me in the subway.

182
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:36,323
Scott: There's emergency exits that let you get back up to the street and they're well lit and then you can find where they are Pretty easily.

183
00:10:36,343 --> 00:10:38,333
Scott: Yeah, especially if the electricity is off.

184
00:10:38,615 --> 00:10:42,340
Rym: if I got trapped on a train I would risk it in the tunnels like I would not dude.

185
00:10:42,421 --> 00:10:42,884
Scott: I'm like you.

186
00:10:42,904 --> 00:10:47,700
Scott: when you're just in the train you can look out the window and say oh look There's a staircase that takes you up to 50 whatever Street.

187
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:50,820
Scott: Oh know that if I ever had to escape this train don't touch the third rail.

188
00:10:51,721 --> 00:10:59,340
Scott: My biggest fear is that if you're in which is completely unrealistic is if you're in a tunnel and the tunnel just cracks open and All the river pours in nothing you knew about that.

189
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,791
Scott: No, but I mean that would be fucking scary as hell.

190
00:11:01,832 --> 00:11:02,394
Scott: way to die.

191
00:11:02,414 --> 00:11:03,520
Scott: who wouldn't want to go that way?

192
00:11:03,741 --> 00:11:05,126
Rym: Yeah, I guess.

193
00:11:05,146 --> 00:11:06,331
Rym: well, you'd probably just drown.

194
00:11:06,593 --> 00:11:07,496
Scott: Yes, you would drown.

195
00:11:07,516 --> 00:11:08,360
Scott: it would suck balls.

196
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,608
Rym: I'd rather drown than I don't know fire.

197
00:11:10,969 --> 00:11:12,273
Rym: I think fire is worse than drowning.

198
00:11:12,294 --> 00:11:14,080
Scott: I might try to kill myself before I drown.

199
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,225
Rym: How by drowning.

200
00:11:16,285 --> 00:11:17,872
Scott: it's like smashing my head against the tree.

201
00:11:17,912 --> 00:11:19,779
Rym: I don't think that would kill you before drowning.

202
00:11:19,819 --> 00:11:20,782
Rym: did I?

203
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:23,198
Scott: Bad news?

204
00:11:23,944 --> 00:11:24,085
Scott: Hope.

205
00:11:24,105 --> 00:11:25,595
Scott: maybe they'd be like rocks caving in.

206
00:11:25,615 --> 00:11:26,219
Scott: I can get crushed.

207
00:11:26,239 --> 00:11:33,366
Rym: plus What if you get lucky and the water rushing in flushes the train car forward and that pocket of air holds out long enough For someone to come rescue you?

208
00:11:33,847 --> 00:11:35,072
Scott: that would be so unlikely.

209
00:11:35,213 --> 00:11:36,458
Rym: It's possible got a holdout.

210
00:11:36,498 --> 00:11:38,738
Rym: Hope I Mean, what do you got to lose?

211
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:41,887
Scott: I guess I would be so.

212
00:11:41,907 --> 00:11:47,354
Rym: yeah, there's debates of if this was Sabotage or if the operator might have.

213
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:48,440
Scott: could it be sabotaged?

214
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:53,219
Rym: So someone tampered with the dead man switch that's supposed to top that just stop the train if there's no one driving it.

215
00:11:54,102 --> 00:11:59,980
Rym: Yeah, how did the trains drive because someone tampered with the thing that's supposed to stop the train if no one's driving it?

216
00:12:00,241 --> 00:12:01,671
Rym: They said it was tampered with.

217
00:12:01,731 --> 00:12:02,738
Rym: it was not an error.

218
00:12:04,384 --> 00:12:05,186
Scott: Uh-huh, so who done it?

219
00:12:05,828 --> 00:12:10,180
Rym: the operator who's supposed to be driving it is apparently out administrative leave and there's an investigation.

220
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:14,355
Rym: All right, my guess people are saying oh maybe terror or whatever.

221
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:25,334
Rym: now my guess is dude jury-rigged it so we didn't have to hold it the whole time while he drove it normally and Accidentally like let it go when he wasn't there the train just left.

222
00:12:25,374 --> 00:12:28,705
Rym: that's gonna make you don't like the people who you know The thing on a lawnmower.

223
00:12:28,745 --> 00:12:30,371
Rym: if you let go of it the blade stops.

224
00:12:30,652 --> 00:12:32,860
Rym: Yeah, and you know everyone just wraps twine around that.

225
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,888
Rym: So it's always up.

226
00:12:34,908 --> 00:12:35,933
Scott: No, we did not do that.

227
00:12:36,294 --> 00:12:37,619
Rym: I did not either Scott, but you know what?

228
00:12:38,183 --> 00:12:43,700
Rym: And most people Disable that as the first thing they do when they get a lawnmower.

229
00:12:44,741 --> 00:12:48,964
Rym: Go to go to the Midwest pick any random garage You can walk right in.

230
00:12:49,005 --> 00:12:51,800
Rym: everyone leaves their garage doors open and look at their lawnmower.

231
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:56,340
Rym: I practically guarantee they have jury rig something to prevent that safety mechanism from working.

232
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:03,406
Scott: Well, if you do that, you should go to a place that begins with a J or P Jeep.

233
00:13:03,426 --> 00:13:09,724
Scott: no a J or a P jail or to prison Or The P pokey.

234
00:13:10,326 --> 00:13:15,077
Rym: so an actual news L. I got an actual news - Scott had nothing I guess.

235
00:13:15,138 --> 00:13:19,278
Rym: or the D dungeon Don't John?

236
00:13:20,024 --> 00:13:21,733
Rym: About how about the lubliette?

237
00:13:22,417 --> 00:13:24,505
Rym: That's Oh Or L.

238
00:13:24,806 --> 00:13:25,509
Scott: Well, that that's it.

239
00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:27,556
Scott: That'd be like saying T the jail.

240
00:13:27,576 --> 00:13:28,058
Scott: Yeah.

241
00:13:31,433 --> 00:13:37,740
Rym: So In other news cuz Scott decided that there is no news worth talking about I couldn't hire world.

242
00:13:38,641 --> 00:13:47,071
Rym: So the other thing I got is a lot of people seem to be really invested in these quote-unquote hoverboards And I don't know why this is such a thing.

243
00:13:47,272 --> 00:13:47,392
Rym: one.

244
00:13:47,432 --> 00:13:49,600
Rym: These things are like two to six hundred dollars.

245
00:13:49,721 --> 00:13:51,193
Scott: It's just like the new scooter.

246
00:13:51,233 --> 00:13:52,762
Scott: as far as I'm concerned I don't give a fuck.

247
00:13:52,822 --> 00:13:58,985
Rym: their cheap shitty pieces of plastic that putter along at about like four to six miles an hour Faster than walking.

248
00:13:59,326 --> 00:13:59,990
Rym: No, it's not.

249
00:14:00,351 --> 00:14:00,994
Scott: I saw a guy.

250
00:14:01,055 --> 00:14:04,840
Scott: I mean I cried the One at full speed down the street.

251
00:14:05,204 --> 00:14:07,967
Scott: I could have gone faster than him But only if I really so.

252
00:14:08,007 --> 00:14:10,099
Rym: most of these things go four to six miles an hour.

253
00:14:10,521 --> 00:14:19,712
Rym: My default walking pace as I confirmed one day on a treadmill by walking just at my normal speed and trying to see My default walking pace is five point one miles an hour.

254
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,438
Rym: These things go four to six.

255
00:14:21,518 --> 00:14:24,447
Scott: So He was booking it.

256
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:32,051
Rym: the I'm saying most expensive of these can go up to 15 miles an hour Which is about like that's close to.

257
00:14:32,092 --> 00:14:33,677
Scott: my buddy might have had that one because he was.

258
00:14:33,758 --> 00:14:34,320
Scott: he was booking it.

259
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:37,190
Rym: Yeah, I would not move that in the street.

260
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:37,893
Scott: Not even the side.

261
00:14:37,953 --> 00:14:39,880
Rym: I would not move that fast on a platform.

262
00:14:40,021 --> 00:14:41,186
Rym: I'm standing on that.

263
00:14:41,206 --> 00:14:42,653
Rym: I have very little control over dude.

264
00:14:42,813 --> 00:14:44,220
Scott: I can't even stand on a skateboard.

265
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:45,985
Scott: So I'm definitely not standing one of these.

266
00:14:46,426 --> 00:14:58,940
Rym: but the interesting thing is that these things like to just explode and catch fire and seriously Injure people because these aren't being manufactured by like, you know, someone who's like a high quality manufacturer of transportation equipment.

267
00:14:59,061 --> 00:15:00,273
Scott: It's not like a bombardier.

268
00:15:00,293 --> 00:15:06,040
Scott: Yeah It is a cheap Chinese knockoff, you know, it's what hoverboard.

269
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:11,907
Scott: Yeah, it's not Otis in order to have enough power to make something move, you know Like with a human being standing on it.

270
00:15:11,988 --> 00:15:16,626
Scott: It can't be like weak in the battery department like a you know A knockoff third-party camera battery.

271
00:15:16,948 --> 00:15:18,915
Scott: It's got to be like a serious fucking battery.

272
00:15:18,955 --> 00:15:20,300
Scott: Like the thing is mostly battery.

273
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:23,391
Rym: Yeah, these things have batteries like those electric bikes have.

274
00:15:23,411 --> 00:15:25,840
Scott: so you have a cheapo battery and a cheapo electric motor.

275
00:15:25,901 --> 00:15:27,515
Scott: That is a recipe for the boom-boom.

276
00:15:28,613 --> 00:15:35,774
Rym: so Yeah, these things just keep Exploding and seriously hurting people and cuz they're not being manufactured.

277
00:15:35,854 --> 00:15:37,880
Scott: What high quality person is manufacturing.

278
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:45,064
Rym: So that's the interesting thing because I was poking around a little bit because a lot of people said oh don't buy a knockoff one Buy the real one.

279
00:15:45,084 --> 00:15:45,827
Scott: What's the real one?

280
00:15:45,867 --> 00:15:47,172
Scott: There is no real one.

281
00:15:47,252 --> 00:15:49,120
Rym: They're all basically the same.

282
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:55,739
Rym: There's like four or five Chinese manufacturers who are making these things white and people are buying them white label and just selling them.

283
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,867
Rym: Yeah, there's zero quality control.

284
00:15:57,927 --> 00:16:01,380
Scott: No, like, you know, at least with like say previous transportation devices.

285
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:02,264
Scott: It's like there's.

286
00:16:02,404 --> 00:16:10,375
Scott: there's some brand that's like the real brand like, you know, there's the GoPro camera Yeah, there's the razor scooter and then there's the pro pro and the bazer right?

287
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:11,178
Scott: There's the segue.

288
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:14,249
Rym: segue Yeah, then there's the Sorni the magnet box, right?

289
00:16:14,309 --> 00:16:14,610
Scott: It's like.

290
00:16:14,811 --> 00:16:20,674
Scott: but for these there isn't a real brand Originated as a cheap knockoff and there's only knockoffs.

291
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:21,760
Scott: There's no real one.

292
00:16:22,701 --> 00:16:27,240
Rym: They seem to have been embraced weirdly by the hip-hop community.

293
00:16:28,141 --> 00:16:33,220
Scott: Alright, I thought it was in the same community of like using razor scooters like little teenagers and kids in the neighborhood.

294
00:16:33,341 --> 00:16:41,059
Rym: I always I was doing a lot of research over lunch just cuz I was you know kind of cuz I found a Twitter feed that was just vines and videos of these things exploding.

295
00:16:42,263 --> 00:16:52,436
Rym: but Basically as far as I can tell these are most popular among like Boring upper middle like the children of boring upper middle-class suburban people the razor scooter.

296
00:16:52,556 --> 00:16:55,145
Rym: Yeah, okay and Hip-hop enthusiasts.

297
00:16:55,707 --> 00:16:58,457
Rym: All right, like bunch of rappers are using for stuff.

298
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,340
Scott: That's totally cool.

299
00:16:59,401 --> 00:17:00,519
Scott: You can rap while you're on this.

300
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,885
Scott: It's hard to rap on a bicycle.

301
00:17:01,905 --> 00:17:05,460
Rym: you're huffing and puffing and you know and I can see that and I feel that style.

302
00:17:05,621 --> 00:17:06,365
Scott: But you can.

303
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:08,415
Scott: you can zip on a stage of this thing and back.

304
00:17:08,858 --> 00:17:12,250
Rym: Oh Be awesome, but why do we call them hover boards?

305
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:13,012
Rym: They're not boards.

306
00:17:13,053 --> 00:17:13,694
Rym: They do not hover.

307
00:17:14,056 --> 00:17:15,260
Scott: someone called it that.

308
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,813
Scott: I think I originally see what they are.

309
00:17:17,116 --> 00:17:18,944
Rym: They're Handless segues.

310
00:17:19,346 --> 00:17:23,859
Scott: I mean it the first time I saw one they actually called it by some other name dirt boards.

311
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,005
Scott: No, it's like.

312
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:28,639
Scott: I guess it might be the original name of it was like the something tech something I don't know.

313
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,161
Rym: Well, there's a few things like this is mono wheel thing Like?

314
00:17:31,181 --> 00:17:36,408
Rym: this kind of thing has been around for a while and someone just decided to manufacture a bunch of super dangerous ones to start Selling them.

315
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:40,619
Rym: All right Yeah They're also technically illegal in New York.

316
00:17:41,141 --> 00:17:42,004
Rym: I mean any kind of like.

317
00:17:42,025 --> 00:17:57,858
Scott: the same is anything anything that is a powered transportation device That is not registered with the Department of Motor Vehicles like a car or a motorcycle or a truck is Illegal in New York, but some have a motor device that isn't registered with the Department of Motor Vehicles.

318
00:17:57,898 --> 00:18:04,560
Rym: now simultaneously There are some exceptions for very specific classes of devices, but that excludes most things.

319
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:10,240
Scott: Exceptions are things like a power wheels for your kid as long as he stays in the driveway and the sidewalk.

320
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:15,680
Rym: I believe there's an exception for power assist bicycles as well, but I'm not a hundred percent sure.

321
00:18:16,004 --> 00:18:17,000
Scott: I never heard of that one.

322
00:18:17,144 --> 00:18:23,060
Scott: I found Conflicting reports of whether or not there's far as I know a powered by anything less than a moped can't be ready.

323
00:18:23,121 --> 00:18:24,799
Rym: Oh, so there are rules around that.

324
00:18:26,303 --> 00:18:37,460
Rym: Now where where bikes that have power assists are Okay, but bikes that just drive without any pedaling or not, okay I can't quite figure that out.

325
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,732
Scott: I mean just go to the DMV and get a little license.

326
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:41,140
Scott: the same one they can say it's a moped.

327
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:44,068
Scott: Just say that even if it's not and you'll be probably.

328
00:18:44,128 --> 00:18:46,033
Rym: but that's the thing in New York City.

329
00:18:46,114 --> 00:18:56,453
Rym: specifically if something Cannot is something is regulated and there's a thing that's like that thing But is not like that thing enough to be licensed the same way?

330
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:58,460
Rym: the answer isn't oh, it's okay.

331
00:18:58,541 --> 00:18:59,960
Rym: Then the answer is it's illegal.

332
00:19:00,523 --> 00:19:04,140
Rym: That's why airsoft guns are as illegal as real guns.

333
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:13,040
Scott: The thing that really bothers me is that people who want to use some weirdo transportation device on the road There's already a legal option and that is the three-wheeled motor vehicle.

334
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:21,665
Scott: Yeah As far as I know from everything I've seen in my life the truck in New York City and New York State if you have A three-wheeled vehicle.

335
00:19:21,685 --> 00:19:26,700
Scott: There's pretty much almost no regulation and you can go to the DMV and get a license plate for it.

336
00:19:27,061 --> 00:19:34,720
Scott: And like I've seen such a wide variety of three-wheeled vehicles It seems like there's basically almost no regulation on what it takes for that to be street-legal.

337
00:19:34,821 --> 00:19:35,849
Scott: I've seen them without lights.

338
00:19:36,112 --> 00:19:37,100
Scott: They have a license plate.

339
00:19:37,481 --> 00:19:45,166
Scott: I've seen them like with the one wheel in the front the one wheel in the back all kind of wide real fucking wide like wider than one lane wide.

340
00:19:45,547 --> 00:19:48,800
Scott: four wheels in the back two on each side with one big one in the front.

341
00:19:49,241 --> 00:19:55,177
Scott: I've seen ridiculous shit and all of them have license plates and I've seen cops near a few of these.

342
00:19:55,438 --> 00:20:01,160
Scott: not even give a shit Because apparently the law is such that if it's got three wheels you could do almost whatever the fuck you want.

343
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,553
Scott: So people put a third wheel on this fucking hoverboard.

344
00:20:04,593 --> 00:20:05,717
Scott: Yeah, and we are good to go.

345
00:20:06,942 --> 00:20:12,560
Rym: But I feel like this tech needs a little more iteration before it would be cooler for me to you.

346
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:18,060
Scott: I don't understand why there some company that's actually capable of manufacturing quality goods doesn't get in on this.

347
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,790
Scott: Yeah, I think part of the segue is too big.

348
00:20:21,091 --> 00:20:23,581
Rym: this like segues are dumb even in conventions Like.

349
00:20:23,601 --> 00:20:26,033
Rym: they just get in the way, but these would be great.

350
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:27,419
Rym: It's like an enforcer at PAX.

351
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:33,396
Scott: Well, I think part of the rule Is because if you made a good one like say be like a thousand dollars.

352
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:36,888
Scott: Let's say bombardier made one Yeah, or like who else could make one?

353
00:20:36,908 --> 00:20:38,153
Scott: Suzuki could probably make one.

354
00:20:38,173 --> 00:20:41,816
Scott: right people have the you know, the capacity Yeah thousand two thousand dollars.

355
00:20:41,837 --> 00:20:51,420
Scott: that yeah It would cost so much money for the good one that everyone only the richest like, you know People would buy one and everyone in knowing normal people would buy what even couldn't sell enough.

356
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:57,489
Rym: They're selling these for four to six hundred bucks and that is not what they cost to make Especially cuz they clearly like.

357
00:20:57,549 --> 00:21:08,420
Scott: I imagine you at the battery pack probably is Remember my my tablet video from before I imagined is just dogs breakfast I imagine is just a bunch of cheap lithium ion batteries all you know in a pack, right?

358
00:21:08,741 --> 00:21:11,594
Scott: It's anything fancy tape together solder together.

359
00:21:11,615 --> 00:21:21,317
Rym: Yeah anyway anyway things of the day Got a thing of the day.

360
00:21:21,579 --> 00:21:23,050
Scott: I did remember one at the last second.

361
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:26,210
Scott: I already posted this in the forum, but if you're listening to the show you're probably not into the forum.

362
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:34,799
Scott: So yeah, you also probably don't go to packs apparently, but I digress anyway, so Way back in the 90s 1999 or 98 but actually no 99.

363
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,210
Scott: All right that phantom mean ass came out cuz it you know Star Wars time.

364
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:38,914
Scott: Let's talk about Star Wars.

365
00:21:39,175 --> 00:21:41,849
Scott: Yeah, the Phantom Menace came out and you know, it was a big deal.

366
00:21:43,793 --> 00:21:56,169
Scott: And at the time, you know There was people lining up outside movie theaters to get tickets or to see it including me and him and every other nerd who was alive then and conscious then and The news went to report on these long lines.

367
00:21:56,654 --> 00:22:02,510
Scott: so somebody went and took News reports from those days and cut them up and made this little video here for you to watch.

368
00:22:03,293 --> 00:22:07,790
Scott: And it shows Star Wars fans before going in being like oh, it's gonna be so good guys.

369
00:22:08,111 --> 00:22:08,532
Scott: Oh good.

370
00:22:08,974 --> 00:22:11,583
Scott: Oh, and then it shows what they said when they came out.

371
00:22:12,025 --> 00:22:16,097
Scott: Oh and when they came out You'd be surprised pretty much all.

372
00:22:16,278 --> 00:22:17,883
Scott: every single person was like, oh my god.

373
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:18,726
Scott: It was life-changing.

374
00:22:18,787 --> 00:22:19,650
Scott: I'm gonna see it again.

375
00:22:20,512 --> 00:22:22,059
Rym: Cuz I remember walking out of that movie.

376
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:23,405
Rym: it was me and a bunch of our friends.

377
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:24,330
Rym: we walk out.

378
00:22:24,771 --> 00:22:25,876
Rym: No one was saying anything.

379
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:27,683
Scott: We were just at the end of this video.

380
00:22:27,703 --> 00:22:31,576
Scott: There's one guy where They're like, how did you like it?

381
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:33,303
Scott: He's like not suck two thumbs down.

382
00:22:33,323 --> 00:22:35,150
Scott: everyone had everyone else in the video.

383
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:45,210
Scott: Yeah This has resulted in people who like Phantom Menace saying look it's actually good all you people who don't like it are on the bandwagon.

384
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:51,809
Scott: You Would have liked it if it wasn't the situation where everyone else, you know didn't like it.

385
00:22:52,122 --> 00:22:54,197
Rym: Yeah I can at least say cuz I.

386
00:22:54,237 --> 00:22:56,988
Scott: and then the response to that is jar jar bangs.

387
00:22:57,028 --> 00:23:00,783
Rym: I rest my case Because we were and we sat there silently.

388
00:23:00,863 --> 00:23:01,667
Rym: the credits roll.

389
00:23:01,707 --> 00:23:02,370
Rym: I think it was Greg.

00:23:02,611 --> 00:23:03,676
Scott: I mean the movies not you.

392
00:23:07,995 --> 00:23:08,959

393
00:23:09,581 --> 00:23:10,805
Rym: the potteries was not great.

394
00:23:10,946 --> 00:23:12,050
Rym: Yeah, I was not a fan.

395
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:13,094
Scott: This video is great.

396
00:23:13,114 --> 00:23:14,299
Rym: So yeah, that video is great.

397
00:23:14,581 --> 00:23:16,790
Rym: But I just remember Craig turned to us like everyone's in quiet.

398
00:23:16,892 --> 00:23:17,526
Rym: He was like guys.

399
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:20,616
Rym: That wasn't that good was it?

400
00:23:20,636 --> 00:23:25,853
Scott: Yeah, and we're all like nah, but what if Craig turned to you and said, oh man That was amazing.

401
00:23:25,873 --> 00:23:29,508
Rym: Would you guys been like, yeah, I would have been like, who are you?

402
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:31,288
Rym: How did you?

403
00:23:32,691 --> 00:23:43,389
Scott: Anyway, yeah, but they there's actually some articles going around lately which reminded me of something I knew and forgot which is that The current culture of movie trailers was started by the Phantom Menace.

404
00:23:44,331 --> 00:23:44,673
Scott: You know what?

405
00:23:44,813 --> 00:23:53,357
Scott: when the Phantom Menace had a movie trailer and you could only see it before a few different shitty movies like Waterboy and such and so I Pirated it from the internet cuz I knew the fuck.

406
00:23:53,417 --> 00:23:58,954
Scott: I was like that trailer on the internet and the day after Lucasfilm put It on the internet and it was hard to get it But I knew what I was doing.

407
00:23:58,994 --> 00:24:03,413
Scott: so I had it and that was like the first time anyone had ever watched a movie trailer Anything internet.

408
00:24:03,634 --> 00:24:07,490
Scott: we downloaded this like, you know, it wasn't even an mp4 is an mpg file.

409
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:10,400
Scott: Yeah, I just an mpeg2 file, you know what that trailer?

410
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:13,470
Scott: it took a long time to download with our shitty 56k modems.

411
00:24:13,933 --> 00:24:14,699
Scott: We watched it.

412
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:20,170
Scott: It was a big friggin deal I can you know, you had to have a good computer to be able to play the video file, you know.

413
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:21,399
Scott: And that was like a huge deal.

414
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:39,489
Scott: and ever and then ever since then You know that was when like the movie trailer thing Became a thing and you get apple.com slash trailers and I think you know According to some articles like by getting that the movie trailer thing going Apple got like 600,000 QuickTime downloads at once.

415
00:24:41,091 --> 00:24:42,516
Scott: Yeah, it was a big deal.

416
00:24:42,596 --> 00:24:46,970
Scott: so, you know nowadays you just watch movie trailers at apple.com trailers like it's nothing.

417
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:49,458
Scott: But Phantom Menace is the reason that that started.

418
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,765
Rym: so there this is a clip.

419
00:24:51,825 --> 00:24:53,390
Rym: Emily found this and it's wonderful.

420
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,076
Rym: So, you know Margaret Atwood is right.

421
00:24:55,317 --> 00:25:00,223
Scott: Yeah, I mean every friggin person in the world is like saying oh my god, Margaret I would read this book.

422
00:25:00,263 --> 00:25:00,830
Scott: read that book.

Scott: Oh, she's making a comic about a bird man or what a bird cat boy.

424
00:25:04,932 --> 00:25:09,030
Scott: And basically, I think she just got to be the next book club because it's just no one's shutting up about it.

425
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:10,188
Scott: So there's no avoiding it.

471
00:27:32,767 --> 00:27:33,310
Rym: That's fine.

472
00:27:34,812 --> 00:27:36,145
Rym: Also Magellan didn't actually make it.

473
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,378
Rym: His crew killed him before they made it.

474
00:27:38,398 --> 00:27:39,946

00:27:40,187 --> 00:27:40,810
Rym: the boat made it.

476
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:41,374

00:27:43,971 --> 00:27:48,270
Rym: We're gonna go home stupid and then it get like a little bit further and they're like, oh, I guess we made it.

480
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:49,879
Scott: Well, Magellan is probably also a jerk.

481
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:51,730
Rym: I suspect Magellan was a dick.

482
00:27:52,031 --> 00:27:52,854
Scott: I don't suspect.

483
00:27:53,095 --> 00:27:57,250
Scott: I mean, did you ever get learned about a conquistador or an explorer in school?

484
00:27:57,512 --> 00:27:58,645
Scott: That was like a super nice guy.

485
00:27:58,787 --> 00:28:03,909
Rym: Awesome yeah, like Columbus makes a lot of them look like super nice guys by comparison.

486
00:28:03,929 --> 00:28:10,938
Rym: and Finally the word the least worst one is I mean, I mean Cortez was the worst As far as we know.

487
00:28:10,958 --> 00:28:14,173
Scott: the stories at least which are half fictional I guess dramatized.

488
00:28:14,253 --> 00:28:16,440
Scott: Ponce de Leon was just a moron and not an evil.

489
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,828
Scott: Yeah, but I'm sure he was also a bad person.

490
00:28:19,169 --> 00:28:22,801
Scott: Yeah Wasn't a good person with a hero.

491
00:28:23,304 --> 00:28:24,410

513
00:29:23,864 --> 00:29:26,940
Rym: if I get enough questions I'm gonna shut the form down because I'm not gonna do.

514
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,150
Rym: we're not doing like a four hour Q&A episode.

515
00:29:30,571 --> 00:29:32,443
Rym: There's like 11 in there right now already.

516
00:29:32,463 --> 00:29:33,470
Rym: I opened it a few days ago.

517
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:35,970
Scott: You can just like when we do an episode if it gets too long.

518
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:38,422
Scott: We can just hold those questions off in the next month true.

519
00:29:38,442 --> 00:29:39,427
Rym: Just start queuing them up on the list.

520
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:40,633
Scott: They'll be a queue.

521
00:29:40,975 --> 00:29:44,290
Rym: Yeah a coup queue because no one understands the coup stuff.

522
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,337
Rym: Yeah, no one knows what the red envelope is.

523
00:29:46,538 --> 00:29:46,980
Rym: Literally.

524
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,156
Scott: No one you can sort of guess just by One guy's.

525
00:29:51,237 --> 00:29:56,665
Scott: I tell you that there are a box Questions and in some of the questions are in a red envelope and some are in a white.

526
00:29:56,886 --> 00:29:57,890
Scott: but most of them are white.

527
00:29:58,553 --> 00:30:01,346
Scott: You can surmise there is something special about the red one.

528
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:03,254
Scott: one person What could it be say?

529
00:30:03,455 --> 00:30:05,021
Rym: cuz I scammed the question like skimmed him.

530
00:30:05,201 --> 00:30:07,370
Rym: one person said their question was a red envelope question.

531
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:08,153
Scott: Was it actually?

532
00:30:08,334 --> 00:30:09,841
Rym: they asked what we do on the holidays?

533
00:30:09,861 --> 00:30:13,677
Rym: Oh, no red envelope Misinterpreting the red envelope.

534
00:30:13,797 --> 00:30:14,099
Rym: Yes.

535
00:30:14,581 --> 00:30:16,230
Scott: It's not because it belongs to Santa Claus.

536
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:21,845
Rym: So I never had a real job until after I graduated high school.

537
00:30:21,905 --> 00:30:23,130
Scott: What counts as a real job?

538
00:30:23,793 --> 00:30:24,176
Rym: You know what?

539
00:30:24,457 --> 00:30:26,489
Rym: I think what I might say is part-time jobs.

540
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:31,805
Rym: I was a camp counselor a job where you file a w-4 every job.

541
00:30:31,846 --> 00:30:32,026
Scott: Yeah.

542
00:30:32,066 --> 00:30:32,287
Scott: Okay.

543
00:30:32,327 --> 00:30:33,330
Scott: See I had real jobs in high school.

544
00:30:33,571 --> 00:30:34,435
Rym: So I did not.

545
00:30:34,696 --> 00:30:40,139
Rym: I never had a job that I paid taxes on Until after I graduated.

546
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:40,681
Scott: Okay.

547
00:30:40,841 --> 00:30:43,009
Scott: I mean I only filled out an easy form, but I still filled it out.

548
00:30:43,109 --> 00:30:46,354
Rym: Yeah Well, actually so before that I did have a job I didn't pay taxes on.

549
00:30:46,735 --> 00:30:50,150
Scott: I gave and I guess I probably paid no taxes because I made so little money.

550
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:56,070
Rym: Yeah, I gave professional trumpet and French horn lessons to kids in like Sterling Heights.

551
00:30:56,791 --> 00:31:05,191
Rym: Okay, cuz I was a really good trumpet player and I was actually apparently a really good trumpet teacher - you know much I charged for that in 1997.

552
00:31:05,191 --> 00:31:06,837
Scott: dollars ten bucks an hour.

553
00:31:06,977 --> 00:31:08,302
Rym: thirty bucks an hour.

554
00:31:08,683 --> 00:31:09,386
Rym: and you know what.

555
00:31:09,406 --> 00:31:12,031
Rym: you know who paid that Everyone.

556
00:31:12,552 --> 00:31:15,742
Rym: I had as much work as I wanted all under the table.

557
00:31:15,963 --> 00:31:18,250
Rym: statute of limitations is so far gone.

558
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,918
Scott: Oh, yeah, cuz someone's gonna really come out.

559
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:21,325

565
00:31:38,215 --> 00:31:42,187
Rym: Yeah, you know why cuz it paid like 15 bucks an hour job wasn't?

566
00:31:42,227 --> 00:31:43,974
Scott: I don't think you had to go to Doors job.

567
00:31:44,034 --> 00:31:45,260
Rym: That's the job I wanted.

568
00:31:45,823 --> 00:31:46,386
Rym: Oh, really?

569
00:31:46,426 --> 00:31:47,250
Rym: Yeah, but that's job everyone.

570
00:31:47,371 --> 00:31:50,243
Rym: I don't think you want that job that pays 15 to 20 bucks an hour.

571
00:31:50,263 --> 00:31:51,087
Scott: go to this.

572

Rym: No, I would have been doing it.

574
00:31:54,583 --> 00:31:57,416
Rym: you do it in the place you live So I would do it like in sterling heights.

575
00:31:57,617 --> 00:31:58,842
Rym: Okay, that's how it works.

576
00:31:59,504 --> 00:32:00,910
Rym: So but that was part-time.

577
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:01,779
Rym: It wouldn't have been enough money.

578
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,555
Rym: So I Took this government Functionary test.

579
00:32:05,575 --> 00:32:08,370
Rym: you had to take a test to join the sense that you're gonna edit a plus on that test.

580
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:09,475
Rym: So I got a perfect score.

581
00:32:09,737 --> 00:32:12,450

585
00:32:23,688 --> 00:32:27,607
Rym: and Apparently I got a perfect score like duh.

586
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:32,504
Rym: Apparently I was one of the only people who was above the line.

587
00:32:32,524 --> 00:32:35,725
Scott: if you're allowed to hire this person I mean None of those people could like.

00:32:50,648 --> 00:33:01,249
Rym: So They called me and they're like, yeah we want how you run it the fuck away like before I was ready cuz high school was still going and I was like No, and my parents were like, uh, you should experience what work is like.

608
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:40,690
Scott: And basically I guess they were still doing the census when we went to college.

609
00:33:41,451 --> 00:33:45,184
Rym: So my job was basically to be an accounting and payroll clerk.

610
00:33:46,006 --> 00:33:51,990
Rym: and let me tell you that Job is real hard for a lot of people to do like a lot of my co-workers.

611
00:33:52,372 --> 00:33:54,464
Scott: Well, it's wouldn't you hire an accountant to do that job?

612
00:33:54,847 --> 00:33:58,539
Rym: Uh So the census has to hire an entire.

613
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:01,030
Rym: so there was someone in charge who would like tell people what to do.

614
00:34:01,432 --> 00:34:07,450
Rym: but the work was done by people who didn't need to know how it actually worked and Basically you were able to figure out how it worked.

615
00:34:07,553 --> 00:34:16,614
Rym: I they ended up having keeping only me as the sole clerk for the entire office for the entire time because I could do in About 12 hours a week.

616
00:34:16,976 --> 00:34:21,049
Rym: What took a team of people working for 40 hours a week to do previously?

617
00:34:21,069 --> 00:34:41,949
Rym: and then I started also doing all their IT and basically everything in the office and It was really weird because it was all 40 to 50 year old like women who had husbands or were widows a few old people and This 18 year old punk kid nerd.

618
00:34:42,976 --> 00:34:45,089
Rym: It was a weird experience working there.

619
00:34:46,252 --> 00:34:47,476
Rym: What was your first job?

620
00:34:47,697 --> 00:34:48,542
Scott: I worked at.

621
00:34:49,043 --> 00:34:50,469
Scott: was I go to the dry cleaner for it?

622
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:52,038
Scott: No, I went to the summer camp first.

623
00:34:52,259 --> 00:34:54,188
Scott: or did it summer camp first or dry cleaners first?

624
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,692
Rym: I don't remember.

625
00:34:56,112 --> 00:35:02,836
Scott: and I was a summer camp counselor at two or three different places and then In high school, I worked at a dry cleaner.

626
00:35:02,917 --> 00:35:08,240
Scott: after school I'd take the same bus that took me home would also if I just stayed on it go to the dry cleaner.

627
00:35:08,402 --> 00:35:09,048
Scott: So I'd get off

628
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:10,098
Rym: like school bus sir

629
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:26,420
Scott: Yeah school bus and then I'd just go to the dry cleaner and I'd stay there until it closed like at 6 And then I just go home to my house and eat dinner and I do that like two or three days a week and then also like You know sometimes like Saturday like the be open like Saturday morning or something like until noon or whatever.

630
00:35:26,881 --> 00:35:32,260
Scott: So I'd go in early on Saturday morning and then leave at noon, you know, then watch football or it's on whatever.

631
00:35:32,722 --> 00:35:44,428
Rym: I guess there's always weird having those kinds of jobs like the not a career job For me because the jobs are always like really really easy and yet at the same time They pay almost enough to live.

632
00:35:44,448 --> 00:35:47,380
Scott: it paid me enough that I bought a computer with that monies.

633
00:35:48,181 --> 00:35:52,520
Rym: Yeah, I had some bonds my grandma T&T to video card when it was brand new.

634
00:35:53,183 --> 00:35:56,879
Scott: I basically just saved all the money and bought a computer because I didn't have to buy food or rent or anything.

635
00:35:58,941 --> 00:36:00,627
Scott: And summer camp was pretty much just like.

636
00:36:01,289 --> 00:36:02,514
Scott: also money I didn't spend.

637
00:36:02,855 --> 00:36:04,260
Scott: oh no, I think I used the summer camp money.

638
00:36:04,682 --> 00:36:10,979
Scott: I bought a Gameboy color the day it came out and I bought you know And then I bought games for it a whole bunch all the games.

639
00:36:12,644 --> 00:36:20,971
Scott: and then In college, I I think I did summer camp again in between freshman sophomore year Between freshman and sophomore year.

640
00:36:20,992 --> 00:36:22,200
Rym: I went back home to Michigan.

641
00:36:22,381 --> 00:36:28,644
Rym: I went home like they wouldn't let us live in the dorms over the summer and I worked Construction at a Kmart.

642
00:36:28,965 --> 00:36:31,130
Scott: Oh, right that one because they were renovating Kmart's.

643
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:41,155
Rym: they hired construction workers to renovate the inside of this Kmart and That job paid way less than the census and summer camp counselor pays almost nothing.

644
00:36:41,195 --> 00:36:44,287
Scott: you get one check at the end of the job and it's like for hunt.

645
00:36:44,328 --> 00:36:57,327
Scott: it's like not a lot of money at all and The thing is all the money that you know, you you're not an hourly worker It's like being a waiter or waitress whatever but you what you get in return is basically free summer camp Which cost a fortune right?

646
00:36:57,347 --> 00:37:01,691
Scott: You get all that food all that lodging all that You know all those trips that you go on.

647
00:37:01,711 --> 00:37:02,675
Scott: you get to swim in the pool.

648
00:37:02,695 --> 00:37:05,991
Scott: You get to play baseball To do all this shit, right?

649
00:37:06,011 --> 00:37:07,660
Scott: So that's why that's a good job.

650
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:11,840
Scott: I lied and I would totally just be summer camp counselor forever if I could live like that.

651
00:37:12,121 --> 00:37:14,813
Rym: I actually applied with my brother and we both worked at that place.

652
00:37:14,853 --> 00:37:16,763
Rym: like at that came our doing construction that whole summer.

653
00:37:16,784 --> 00:37:27,902
Rym: I lied and Basically said I wasn't going to college and I just graduated high school to get the job Because there's no way they would hire me if they knew I was going to college September you would leave.

654
00:37:28,023 --> 00:37:34,460
Rym: Yeah, and that job was probably the worst experience of my life other than food poisoning.

655
00:37:36,281 --> 00:37:37,828
Rym: Yeah, Lyme disease and food poisoning.

656
00:37:38,149 --> 00:37:49,777
Rym: just because like it was soul-crushing to work So hard doing physical labor for 40 to 60 hours a week making 7 bucks an hour.

657
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,025
Rym: Yeah, but just it.

658
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:58,720
Scott: folding clothes and throwing a bag and the weirdest thing was like putting number two tags on shirts.

659
00:37:58,801 --> 00:38:00,116
Scott: The people got the right shirt back.

660
00:38:00,177 --> 00:38:01,444
Rym: people I had to work with.

661
00:38:01,524 --> 00:38:05,708
Rym: like there was a break room and I go hang on the break room your 15-minute breaks and your 30 minute break.

662
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:14,860
Rym: and They were like I don't want it like they were just the worst people Like they all smoked everyone smoked so they'd all take smoke breaks all the time.

663
00:38:16,241 --> 00:38:27,139
Rym: most of them had graduated from the same high school as me, but Had run up a bunch of credit card debt somehow and had the job to try to pay off all their thousands and thousands of dollars of credit card debt.

664
00:38:27,882 --> 00:38:30,240
Rym: For I guess I don't know how they racked up all those credit.

665
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:35,318
Scott: We need to save money to eat also and they use some of the money to pay the payments on the credit card.

666
00:38:35,339 --> 00:38:38,909
Rym: understand And I just like I literally there was.

667
00:38:38,929 --> 00:38:46,960
Rym: no I I gave up trying to have conversations with anyone there and I Considered just quitting and not having money.

668
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:50,631
Rym: That's how soul crushing that experience was like.

669
00:38:50,792 --> 00:38:56,259
Rym: I was very willing to not have money Rather than continue to do this work somewhere else.

670
00:38:57,523 --> 00:38:59,750
Rym: I was in the suburbs in Michigan.

671
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:01,515
Rym: No one was hiring.

672
00:39:01,956 --> 00:39:03,400
Rym: Okay, there was nowhere to work.

673
00:39:03,802 --> 00:39:07,800
Rym: I also applied to work at that time at a Boston fucking market.

674
00:39:08,201 --> 00:39:14,420
Rym: I had no trouble finding because that paid $12 an hour, but they wouldn't hire me because I was going to college.

675
00:39:14,501 --> 00:39:20,864
Rym: So when I applied to the construction job, I lied different restaurant Scott.

676
00:39:21,167 --> 00:39:30,349
Rym: no one was hiring because Most of the jobs were being taken by people who did not escape the orbit of that suburb Had just graduated high school and needed a job.

677
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:31,915
Rym: that was going to be their real job.

678
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:37,726
Scott: Anyway, I At college I worked in The crossroads.

679
00:39:38,411 --> 00:39:39,560
Rym: Oh, yeah, you made me a sandwich.

680
00:39:39,761 --> 00:39:44,140
Rym: I remember your opening night when you were working there like the first day like we all came over and we all heard of sandwiches.

681
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,740
Scott: I would make sandwiches that were way more meat than you were supposed to put on there

682
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,262
Rym: Yeah,

683
00:39:48,484 --> 00:40:01,473
Scott: and I was the awesomest but then eventually after a long time of working there They're like, all right everyone actually used the fucking scales and then I switched over and worked in the grilling area instead and Then I stopped working there because I found I got an office II job.

684
00:40:01,915 --> 00:40:02,095
Rym: Wow.

685
00:40:02,156 --> 00:40:03,120
Rym: I'd pretty much the same thing.

686
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:06,796
Rym: I mean I worked at that the Ritz until I quit in disguise.

687
00:40:07,137 --> 00:40:08,583
Scott: I didn't quit it Just sort of lapsed.

688
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,667
Scott: and in the summer, right?

689
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:11,775
Scott: Yeah, and then I got an office II job.

690
00:40:11,796 --> 00:40:12,940
Rym: Yeah, I got the opposite job.

691
00:40:12,981 --> 00:40:17,740
Scott: It was the office I was in was like the student services like students would come in and be like, oh I need help with this.

692
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,895
Scott: I'm like, alright, I'll help you.

693
00:40:20,243 --> 00:40:26,320
Scott: and then in the summer What happened was obviously don't need as many people for that job in the summer because it's not a lot of students to service.

694
00:40:26,561 --> 00:40:32,559
Scott: Yeah, so I was actually working in two different student service offices in the art school like switching between them.

695
00:40:33,082 --> 00:40:35,880
Scott: So I only I was went down to just one of the two offices in the summer.

696
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:41,920
Scott: But then like this person who had been there for years was like actually I do I couldn't get a real job in the summer.

697
00:40:42,002 --> 00:40:42,659
Scott: Let me come back.

698
00:40:42,761 --> 00:40:57,880
Scott: So they kicked me out Which was actually a blessing in disguise because I got kicked out to go to the scheduling office instead Which was a much higher profile job and the actual scheduling officer was like super awesome And she brought a little doggy to her wiener doggy to work.

699
00:40:58,221 --> 00:41:00,045
Scott: Nice and we just hang out in there.

700
00:41:00,647 --> 00:41:06,884
Scott: and she kept like pushing with like the student employment office to like raise the category of That job constantly.

701
00:41:06,904 --> 00:41:11,379
Scott: Whoa, I just kept getting paid and I was doing like, you know, like quality work.

702
00:41:11,641 --> 00:41:15,100
Scott: It was like it's pretty much like the best job you could have on campus.

703
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,940
Scott: I think mine was and I kept that job like for three years.

704
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,266
Scott: I was almost equally good.

705
00:41:19,427 --> 00:41:22,000
Rym: I worked at the GCC at the office of grants contracts intellectual.

706
00:41:22,081 --> 00:41:26,108
Rym: I just kept that job as long as in school my only duties were the office.

707
00:41:26,148 --> 00:41:35,200
Rym: ladies would need stuff like I do in her office mail, which is great because I get a bunch of envelopes and I just have to deliver them to wherever they had to go all over campus outside of the nice weather all day.

708
00:41:35,642 --> 00:41:38,517
Scott: The scheduling office is super good because it wasn't like oh you're a student.

709
00:41:38,738 --> 00:41:46,240
Scott: sometimes We'd help a student get their schedule in order But mostly it was schedule of like this class is going to be at one on Wednesday.

710
00:41:46,765 --> 00:41:48,240
Rym: Oh, I never had that power.

711
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:52,739
Scott: It was that kind of scheduling right and I could see things like admissions and like I was.

712
00:41:52,819 --> 00:41:54,290
Scott: you know I was in but it's all art school.

713
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:55,620
Scott: It wasn't the same school.

714
00:41:55,741 --> 00:41:58,580
Rym: I don't think they would let you work in the scheduling office of your own department.

715
00:41:58,881 --> 00:42:00,952
Scott: No, I mean that might be I don't know.

716
00:42:00,972 --> 00:42:03,907
Scott: but like I was I had my hands on everything We're and we were getting shit done.

717
00:42:03,927 --> 00:42:19,197
Rym: Yeah, but basically where I was I would mostly do data entry like they have these like multi-million dollar contracts to do research at the school and Like some company would basically pay the school and a grant to do the research and all this kind of stuff.

718
00:42:19,518 --> 00:42:28,653
Rym: So I would Data enter from the contracts into the system that tracked all that and if I finished all that There was really nothing else to do.

719
00:42:28,693 --> 00:42:31,427
Rym: So I just sat around Switch over to the IT department.

720
00:42:31,748 --> 00:42:32,370
Rym: Oh way later.

721
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:33,655
Rym: That was way later.

722
00:42:33,675 --> 00:42:34,638
Rym: That was like senior year.

723
00:42:34,658 --> 00:42:36,609
Rym: Okay Yeah senior year I applied to work.

724
00:42:36,669 --> 00:42:38,379
Scott: I stayed in the same place right up to the end.

725
00:42:38,621 --> 00:42:47,400
Rym: I applied to work at the IT department and they didn't want to hire me at first Partly because I was gonna graduate at the end of the year partly because I never actually worked in IT before.

726
00:42:47,801 --> 00:42:51,698
Rym: Apparently they wanted experience from students going to IT school in IT.

727
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:54,739
Rym: So yeah, that's great.

728
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:05,179
Rym: and They also I think my professor's Disrecommended me because I can't add reputation for being a shit who never came to class.

729
00:43:06,303 --> 00:43:07,131
Rym: And I was that legal.

730
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:08,020
Scott: is that a Lieber violin?

731
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:08,983
Rym: I have no idea.

732
00:43:09,023 --> 00:43:13,180
Rym: but no one no professor in the IT department liked me if they knew not even trumpet gang.

733
00:43:14,202 --> 00:43:17,019
Rym: I only had one class with him and he loved me because it was the music class.

734
00:43:18,423 --> 00:43:23,480
Rym: He actually taught the IT new media music composition and digital whatever class.

735
00:43:23,681 --> 00:43:27,480
Rym: That was the audition and Pro Tools in recording studio class that I took with Katsu.

736
00:43:29,062 --> 00:43:30,588
Rym: That was the only class was great.

737
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:31,532
Scott: What's that guy's name again?

738
00:43:31,552 --> 00:43:33,300
Rym: Uh, I'll Biles.

739
00:43:34,221 --> 00:43:35,105
Scott: Yeah, Google him.

740
00:43:35,125 --> 00:43:37,496
Rym: See if he's around I'll look up what his business was.

741
00:43:38,078 --> 00:43:51,219
Rym: but basically, they didn't want to hire me and then I went off and co-opted IBM and I came back as like a super IT professional and I interviewed them again and they were like you are way overqualified and I was like WTF

742
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:52,242
Scott: Yeah,

743
00:43:52,725 --> 00:43:53,831
Rym: and then basically they

744
00:43:53,871 --> 00:43:55,479
Scott: told me in person I was six months ago.

745
00:43:55,721 --> 00:43:58,411
Rym: Yeah, except now I worked at IBM and now suddenly I'm too good for you.

746
00:43:58,491 --> 00:44:00,660
Scott: Like I know just I didn't learn anything there.

747
00:44:01,262 --> 00:44:05,440
Rym: I mean, I guess in a school we're like, I mean how many thousands of IT people are there?

748
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:11,147
Rym: There are more IT students than any other single major and every one of them wanted to work for the IT department of the campus For obvious reasons.

749
00:44:11,208 --> 00:44:18,119
Rym: Yes, so they made me a Project manager and said that my expertise your job was upgrading the outlooks, right?

750
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:21,760
Rym: Yes, my job was managing the project of upgrading the outlooks.

751
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:25,173
Scott: But you went to a lot of teachers to upgrade those outlooks.

752
00:44:25,273 --> 00:44:25,635
Scott: I did.

753
00:44:25,655 --> 00:44:26,620
Scott: they were unhappy with you.

754
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,246
Rym: They were super fucking butter.

755
00:44:28,266 --> 00:44:32,260
Rym: when I took away their giant giant archive files of like back in the day.

756
00:44:32,381 --> 00:44:34,099
Rym: You know four gigabytes was a lot of space.

757
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:51,539
Rym: And actually that job was so trivial that most of my time they gave me off my own office Downstairs, I just sat there doing nothing playing my gameboy Poking around on the internet because there was literally no work to do because I did it all in like a couple hours.

758
00:44:52,061 --> 00:44:53,265
Scott: It was awesome over cloth.

759
00:44:53,346 --> 00:45:06,058
Rym: I paid a lot and I was supposed to mentor people but all the other kids they hired Were goody-two-shoes like teachers pets who knew a lot of like the textbook stuff of IT But didn't know how to actually do anything.

760
00:45:07,503 --> 00:45:10,036
Rym: So none of them wanted to actually work with me because I'd make them work.

761
00:45:10,398 --> 00:45:21,180
Rym: So I They'd be like, well, I guess I'm gonna go over there and copy the PST file over like no no, no, no, no, you're gonna sit here and learn out learn bash.

762
00:45:21,441 --> 00:45:23,430
Rym: You're gonna write a script to do that shit from here.

763
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:25,599
Rym: That's right, and no one wanted to do that.

764
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:29,288
Rym: Okay, so, uh, what after that?

765
00:45:29,329 --> 00:45:30,092
Rym: because you had co-op.

766
00:45:30,172 --> 00:45:31,779
Scott: I had a co-op where I worked.

767
00:45:32,502 --> 00:45:44,448
Scott: I got a cop because James worked there already is it was this place that James already worked and They were basically like they just did contract work of making hardware and software for people Mostly in like industrial places.

768
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:45,954
Rym: So oh, yeah the batteries.

769
00:45:46,355 --> 00:45:47,620
Scott: Well, James was doing batteries.

770
00:45:47,801 --> 00:45:52,220
Scott: He wrote software for battery chargers of the military, but at this place.

771
00:45:52,300 --> 00:46:06,339
Scott: But then what we the project that we were hired to do was this place that had like a corn syrup Factory had like all these pumps and it was the place that managed the pumps I guess and they needed to monitor the pumps for like temperature vibration, etc.

772
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:11,514
Scott: It's like if something went wrong They could just think they could just be notified and go to the pump.

773
00:46:11,534 --> 00:46:12,839
Scott: that was fucked up and deal with it.

774
00:46:13,102 --> 00:46:13,557
Rym: I got bad.

775
00:46:13,921 --> 00:46:16,087
Scott: So there were three things and we eat.

776
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:19,999
Scott: James made the smallest most embedded thing which was the sensor that goes on the pump.

777
00:46:20,802 --> 00:46:27,240
Scott: I made this thing which was like a single board CPU and I had to had Linux and had 16 megabytes of flash storage.

778
00:46:27,761 --> 00:46:36,900
Scott: And I basically had to write a program that would with a wireless like interface on the serial port Collect data from the sensors, right?

779
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:47,760
Scott: Sort of gather it into some sort of useful data structure then write it out as like, you know Some sort of normal protocol and send it over a cellular modem.

780
00:46:48,242 --> 00:46:54,285
Scott: I had to like dial in the cellular modem to get to the internet 56k and Communicate with a web server.

781
00:46:54,546 --> 00:46:57,818
Scott: using like soap is what we use then because I didn't even have JSON.

782
00:46:58,119 --> 00:46:58,219
Scott: Oh,

783
00:46:58,279 --> 00:47:00,566
Rym: yeah Wow Yeah I keep forgetting how long ago all this was

784
00:47:00,747 --> 00:47:14,319
Scott: right and I would soap it over to the web server where the and then shitty Alex wrote software that would Take that put it into a MySQL database and had a web interface where you could look at graphs and all this stuff and semi real-ish time.

785
00:47:15,221 --> 00:47:15,844
Scott: And we made that.

786
00:47:15,864 --> 00:47:19,236
Rym: yeah, and that was what you also do a co-op for Rudy.

787
00:47:19,898 --> 00:47:20,400
Scott: That was nice.

788
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:21,925
Scott: So I needed four co-ops.

789
00:47:22,466 --> 00:47:23,810
Scott: I need four co-ops guys.

790
00:47:23,830 --> 00:47:26,980
Rym: Remember RIT is a five-year program for IT and CS.

791
00:47:27,422 --> 00:47:31,919
Rym: You've got to get a real job that pays real money four times.

792
00:47:33,485 --> 00:47:36,294
Scott: Even if RIT hears this and takes away my degree, I don't give a shit.

793
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:37,317
Scott: It's not like I'll lose my job.

794
00:47:37,478 --> 00:47:41,568
Scott: Yeah so I Had to do four co-ops.

795
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:43,720
Scott: the first two co-ops were ten weeks.

796
00:47:44,081 --> 00:47:44,603
Scott: Well 20 weeks.

797
00:47:44,764 --> 00:47:46,933
Scott: at making that real those are legit co-ops.

798
00:47:47,013 --> 00:47:48,740
Scott: making this thing for the pump people, right?

799
00:47:49,304 --> 00:47:51,279
Scott: Then I had to do a co-op.

800
00:47:51,541 --> 00:47:55,414
Scott: So I managed to as a camp counselor at cyber camps.

801
00:47:55,535 --> 00:47:56,980
Scott: now that should count as a co-op.

802
00:47:57,522 --> 00:48:01,180
Scott: But actually that was only like a two three week camp not a ten week camp.

803
00:48:02,961 --> 00:48:04,285
Scott: So whatevs deal with it?

804
00:48:04,326 --> 00:48:06,593
Rym: co-ops had to be 10 to 20 weeks.

805
00:48:06,774 --> 00:48:08,680
Scott: Anyway, I needed one more co-op.

806
00:48:09,081 --> 00:48:12,431
Scott: I got someone who we knew to fill out the forms.

807
00:48:12,471 --> 00:48:15,460
Scott: that said I did a co-op when I didn't do anything.

808
00:48:15,802 --> 00:48:21,613
Rym: So so ever full disclosure I did something kind of similar in that I worked at IBM.

809
00:48:21,653 --> 00:48:39,806
Rym: Like I got my basically I went from No experience in IT to at IBM as an intern and basically when I got there I realized that I wasn't learning much at RIT and I learned everything I needed to know that I didn't already know what I teach just by working in this IBM like Factory fab

810
00:48:39,846 --> 00:48:41,312
Scott: the job I got after college.

811
00:48:41,412 --> 00:48:47,400
Scott: I started working at before I Technically hit the graduation date at RIT, even though I had finished all my work at RIT.

812
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:49,633
Rym: Yep, so I co-op there after a week.

813
00:48:49,673 --> 00:48:53,740
Rym: They were like, oh you're not an intern You're in charge of the data center now, and I just did a real work for them.

814
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,847
Rym: Like I was just IBM employee as far as they were concerned.

815
00:48:56,409 --> 00:48:57,573
Rym: I had to leave to go back to school.

816
00:48:57,593 --> 00:48:58,617
Rym: RIT.

817
00:48:59,018 --> 00:49:00,626
Rym: I needed Two more.

818
00:49:00,666 --> 00:49:01,859
Rym: I needed one more co-op.

819
00:49:02,581 --> 00:49:05,714
Rym: You're not allowed to do all your co-ops at the same place and you're not allowed to end.

820
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:08,452
Scott: you're not allowed to end on a Co-op end at school.

821
00:49:08,674 --> 00:49:11,660
Rym: So then I Didn't feel normal circumstance.

822
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:18,199
Rym: I didn't fill out the paperwork to get credit for the second part of that co-op at IBM.

823
00:49:18,882 --> 00:49:20,853
Rym: So I technically failed the co-op.

824
00:49:21,054 --> 00:49:22,140
Rym: Yeah, so it's not my try.

825
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:22,803
Rym: I failed it.

826
00:49:23,285 --> 00:49:33,040
Rym: then I went back to IBM and just worked there After I was done with all my classes and should have graduated, but I didn't take senior seminar.

827
00:49:33,803 --> 00:49:36,855
Rym: So technically I was not a graduate candidate yet.

828
00:49:36,895 --> 00:49:42,980
Rym: Like I could not get my degree So I pushed it off as long as I could and then I went back to RIT went to the office.

829
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:49,300
Rym: I was like, look, I tried to get co-ops everywhere But I couldn't and I failed a co-op and I had all this kind of sob story.

830
00:49:49,661 --> 00:49:54,080
Rym: So I got the exemption to have done all my co-ops at IBM and I couldn't end on the co-op.

831
00:49:54,401 --> 00:50:02,960
Rym: So I stopped co-oping took one online class while I just continued to work at IBM Passed it and then I just went to next year's graduation.

832
00:50:04,181 --> 00:50:05,205
Rym: In fact, I picked up your.

833
00:50:05,285 --> 00:50:06,470
Scott: I never went to any graduation.

834
00:50:06,571 --> 00:50:08,920
Rym: I picked up your robe hat and tassel.

835
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:09,522
Rym: I still have them.

836
00:50:09,944 --> 00:50:10,968
Scott: My sister was complaining.

837
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,554
Scott: She's like, oh we didn't.

838
00:50:12,755 --> 00:50:14,120
Scott: no one came to my graduation.

839
00:50:14,281 --> 00:50:17,140
Scott: You made me go to Alex's graduation and I'm like, dude, I didn't go to my own.

840
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,209
Scott: I didn't go anyone's graduation for anything.

841
00:50:19,229 --> 00:50:19,530
Rym: Hey Scott.

842
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:20,937
Rym: Do you want your robe and tassel?

843
00:50:20,977 --> 00:50:21,720
Rym: I still have them.

844
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:22,627
Scott: What the fuck do I need it for?

845
00:50:22,687 --> 00:50:23,916
Rym: I'll give you your tassel after the show.

846
00:50:23,936 --> 00:50:24,420
Rym: I know where it is.

847
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:25,042
Rym: I don't need it.

848
00:50:25,143 --> 00:50:29,158
Rym: It's two says 2005 on it cuz that's the year we both technically graduated can have it.

849
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:34,309
Scott: I got to Job, I got immediately after college.

850
00:50:34,791 --> 00:50:43,500
Scott: I've said oh I got to find a job in New York City now Because I was living at my parents house for a few weeks and I could take the train in New York City And they're sure as hell weren't jobs in Connecticut?

851
00:50:44,221 --> 00:50:59,423
Scott: So I found a job at this place called did business services Which is basically they had a website that let you fill out all at once these forms to get small business loans And then they would sell you services to help your small business like oh you need an accountant You need insurance.

852
00:50:59,443 --> 00:51:00,185
Scott: You need all this stuff.

853
00:51:00,225 --> 00:51:02,554
Scott: We'll just you know, we'll just give you all those things.

854
00:51:02,614 --> 00:51:09,495
Scott: so to simplify your deal and They hired me to make you know web applications, which I'd never done before.

855
00:51:09,575 --> 00:51:12,191
Scott: but I figured I'll figure it out I can program and I did.

856
00:51:12,372 --> 00:51:18,300
Scott: it was no problem and I made some PHP web app that they really didn't give me a lot of instructions and had it what to do.

857
00:51:18,723 --> 00:51:20,138
Scott: They were just like it needs to do this.

858
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:23,480
Scott: So I said and it was like the barest spec ever.

859
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:30,140
Scott: It was like a basically a vague description and I made it and I just did whatever I felt was best and they were satisfied.

860
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:30,856
Scott: I'm like, okay.

861
00:51:31,881 --> 00:51:36,324
Scott: Then they opened up like this disaster recovery office in the middle of fuck nowhere And I was living.

862
00:51:36,385 --> 00:51:39,236
Scott: I moved to beacon like a few weeks after starting this job.

863
00:51:39,256 --> 00:51:42,343
Scott: So You know, I was.

864
00:51:42,424 --> 00:51:42,965
Scott: then they're like.

865
00:51:43,006 --> 00:51:44,190
Scott: we opened up this place.

866
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:45,313
Scott: It's close to you, right?

867
00:51:45,373 --> 00:51:48,025
Scott: And I'm like, maybe I'm like Oh, right.

868
00:51:48,045 --> 00:51:49,858
Rym: You had to drive all the way the fuck out to.

869
00:51:50,822 --> 00:51:55,017
Scott: It was basically the border of Connecticut New York where the Connecticut is like a stick.

870
00:51:55,117 --> 00:52:01,820
Scott: it was like, you know Almost an hour driving each way And I'm like, but if I'm gonna go all the way out there every day, you're gonna buy me a car.

871
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:07,604
Scott: they're like, okay, they raised my salary by the amount that the car payment was and They fixed back then.

872
00:52:07,644 --> 00:52:09,111
Rym: we both thought was an amazing idea.

873
00:52:09,171 --> 00:52:10,536
Scott: I mean it was effectively.

874
00:52:10,577 --> 00:52:12,327
Scott: they bought me a car Yeah, which was fine.

875
00:52:12,367 --> 00:52:13,335
Scott: Someone buys you a car.

876
00:52:13,355 --> 00:52:14,060
Scott: You can't really complain.

877
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:16,531
Scott: They even paid for the tax and you know everything.

878
00:52:16,592 --> 00:52:18,320
Scott: so whatever they bought me a car.

879
00:52:18,903 --> 00:52:22,040
Scott: I drove the Mazda out there every day to go to this disaster recovery office.

880
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:34,214
Scott: They put me on another project and they gave me even less of a vague description like I couldn't even work on it because the description wasn't enough and I tried to talk to people to make meetings with the people actually use the existing thing.

881
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:34,475
Scott: cuz I was.

882
00:52:34,736 --> 00:52:37,348
Scott: now I was replacing an Existing thing that was old.

883
00:52:37,368 --> 00:52:39,799
Scott: was that when hopefully making something better, right?

884
00:52:40,961 --> 00:52:41,985
Scott: But no one would meet with me.

885
00:52:42,025 --> 00:52:43,732
Scott: I couldn't get requirements.

886
00:52:43,873 --> 00:52:44,214
Scott: I tried to.

887
00:52:44,234 --> 00:52:45,540
Scott: I was easy gather requirements.

888
00:52:45,661 --> 00:52:48,380
Scott: I kept trying to gather them and they were ungatherable.

889
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:52,059
Scott: So I was driving to the middle of nowhere to do nothing every day.

890
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:58,236
Rym: now That's funny because that is the same time I had quit IBM because I didn't think there was a long-term career there just because IBM.

891
00:52:58,377 --> 00:53:02,119
Scott: so I just Got tired of driving somewhere to do nothing every day.

892
00:53:02,661 --> 00:53:08,560
Scott: So I quit and I got a job at this other place downtown Manhattan, which had cool people.

893
00:53:08,741 --> 00:53:11,060
Scott: But we were doing shady business, right?

894
00:53:11,483 --> 00:53:15,974
Scott: They were basically making forms online And you try to get people to fill out these forms.

895
00:53:16,014 --> 00:53:25,190
Scott: and if you fill out the form we had your personal information including your social security number and We now knew who you were and the form was saying hey Do you need an auto loan?

896
00:53:25,291 --> 00:53:25,919
Scott: fill out this form?

897
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:30,340
Scott: So we would then go to all these car dealers that were our customers who are paying us a lot of money.

898
00:53:30,943 --> 00:53:37,960
Scott: And if you live near one of these car dealers, we would say hey car dealer We know someone who lives near you who needs an auto load.

899
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:41,659
Scott: We will tell you who they are if you give us monies.

900
00:53:42,942 --> 00:53:43,785
Scott: And we would do this.

901
00:53:43,886 --> 00:53:51,044
Scott: There was not only was there this retail market for this information There was a wholesale market for this information like leads.

902
00:53:51,264 --> 00:53:59,163
Scott: so you basically their sales leads and there's like all this automatic buying and trading of personal information of Sales leads.

903
00:53:59,243 --> 00:53:59,584
Scott: like god.

904
00:53:59,604 --> 00:54:03,460
Rym: There's a gravel going on here, but there's a geek fable going on here.

905
00:54:03,863 --> 00:54:08,075
Rym: So look you got a job After your like initial, you know, RIT job.

906
00:54:08,115 --> 00:54:08,619
Rym: like I had my IBM.

907
00:54:08,841 --> 00:54:11,466
Rym: We both had our initial jobs That we learned stuff in.

908
00:54:11,887 --> 00:54:16,147
Rym: we both got a job that eventually had no work for us to do because remember I quit IBM And worked at that hospital.

909
00:54:16,167 --> 00:54:17,880
Rym: Oh god where there was no work to do.

910
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:21,180
Rym: Like I went to my boss and my boss's boss and all their project manager.

911
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:22,668
Rym: I was like guys is there any project?

912
00:54:22,910 --> 00:54:24,418
Rym: and they give me like nothing.

913
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:27,370
Rym: one day I didn't even fucking show up to work and no one noticed.

914
00:54:28,173 --> 00:54:29,820
Scott: I could have not driven out to the middle of nowhere.

915
00:54:29,981 --> 00:54:30,828
Scott: I probably shouldn't have.

916
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:32,320
Scott: yeah, I should have stayed in beacon.

917
00:54:32,641 --> 00:54:34,689
Scott: I went to the middle of nowhere.

918
00:54:35,271 --> 00:54:37,500
Scott: I started maybe going out there once a week to check on it.

919
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:38,605
Rym: I had to use the billing system.

920
00:54:38,645 --> 00:54:41,960
Rym: So I'd like log my hours like my billable hours against different projects.

921
00:54:42,342 --> 00:54:47,164
Rym: so I started billing 40 hours a week to nothing and No one cared.

922
00:54:47,184 --> 00:54:52,764
Rym: and they were still shocked when I quit despite the fact that I was literally doing Zero work.

923
00:54:53,046 --> 00:54:55,800
Rym: So we both had a job that paid well for.

924
00:54:56,221 --> 00:54:56,964
Rym: Literally not.

925
00:54:57,306 --> 00:55:04,480
Scott: I mean I was fresh out of college and I the first job made 40k Before and then they added on to that the cost of the car.

926
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:12,520
Scott: So hospital paid 50 and then that was in 2005 and then they opted to 60. a lot That's you know, that's not a lot of money, but it's a lot.

927
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:20,980
Scott: I mean, it's more than people I know make yo today, which is way fucked up Especially considering we didn't know how to do it is more than a lot of people make.

928
00:55:21,221 --> 00:55:24,495
Rym: No when I first got my IBM offered me 40k without benefits.

929
00:55:24,576 --> 00:55:25,600
Rym: I was like that is amazing.

930
00:55:26,142 --> 00:55:30,897
Scott: I had benefit every job I've had even the co-op had like profit sharing 401k insurance.

931
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:33,104
Scott: Well, I didn't one of them.

932
00:55:33,305 --> 00:55:41,554
Scott: originally it was a co-op and then I converted into like a full-on employee because every single job I've had to roll over 401k so many times because every single job I've had had one.

933
00:55:41,774 --> 00:55:44,082
Rym: so then so we both were had jobs That did nothing.

934
00:55:44,203 --> 00:55:48,860
Rym: that then turned into the shady era of working for people doing a shady stuff.

935
00:55:49,622 --> 00:55:50,124
Scott: What did you do?

936
00:55:50,164 --> 00:55:54,840
Rym: that was shady when I started getting into the other projects in the hospital that were all like weird?

937
00:55:54,981 --> 00:55:58,180
Rym: Shady kickbacks and I think tax dodges and corruption.

938
00:55:58,713 --> 00:56:09,120
Scott: but anyway they had the shady place went out of business because they got bought and then the 2009 happened and cars were hit pretty hard and it's not like they were doing a good business anyway.

939
00:56:09,341 --> 00:56:17,413
Scott: Yeah, they went under and then I was unemployed for a little while and then I got the job I have now where I basically went on Craigslist like I always did.

940
00:56:17,453 --> 00:56:36,487
Scott: I got every job from Craigslist pretty much yep, and I saw let's find some people making websites and there was some startup and the startup Was making a website that let rich parents Manage the money for their kids trust funds and I was like, okay But they wanted to pay me a lot of money.

941
00:56:36,507 --> 00:56:47,454
Scott: and then the other job was Broadway.com where I work now And it was like, oh they're paying me less money But this is actually a totally real and legit business that isn't going anywhere.

942
00:56:47,534 --> 00:56:48,196
Scott: and I was right.

943
00:56:48,617 --> 00:56:49,640
Scott: and now I make way more money.

944
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:52,620
Scott: Yeah in there for like six seven I did the same thing.

945
00:56:52,700 --> 00:57:02,540
Scott: I responded to an ad on Craigslist around the same time to work for a company that they didn't say what they did all these Recruiters be calling me but every job I've actually gotten is when I looked for one on Craigslist.

946
00:57:02,781 --> 00:57:05,149
Rym: This Craigslist ad was like are you smart?

947
00:57:05,229 --> 00:57:12,097
Rym: and it listed like a bunch of stuff that I could do around like database stuff and Shell scripting and Linux whatever and it but primarily was like you have to be smart.

948
00:57:12,117 --> 00:57:15,800
Rym: and like Red Bull I was like, alright, whatever and I applied to it.

949
00:57:16,822 --> 00:57:18,407
Rym: I do and it turned out.

950
00:57:18,447 --> 00:57:21,757
Rym: it was a broker dealer and I got my job at pipeline and I don't.

951
00:57:21,918 --> 00:57:25,208
Rym: they've offered me 65k and I was shocked at that raise.

952
00:57:25,289 --> 00:57:25,931
Rym: It was amazing.

953
00:57:25,951 --> 00:57:27,136
Rym: And then two months later.

954
00:57:27,156 --> 00:57:36,645
Rym: They're like, uh, yeah you don't know how this works and they gave me a raise to 90 and then the next year to 130. and Then I got bored and quit.

955
00:57:37,147 --> 00:57:40,540
Rym: and now I've worked at you know, where I work now as a product manager.

956
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:43,866
Rym: So like there's there's sort of interest.

957
00:57:44,287 --> 00:57:46,093
Rym: I guess the the geek fable here.

958
00:57:46,695 --> 00:57:48,440
Rym: people are asking to bring that back in the patreon.

959
00:57:49,222 --> 00:57:50,434
Scott: Have skills get job.

960
00:57:50,474 --> 00:57:58,060
Rym: No have skills I'm sorry, but notice like I couldn't get a job working at my own college's IT department because I didn't have experience.

961
00:57:58,921 --> 00:58:02,932
Rym: But then I got a job at IBM, which you could get without experience.

962
00:58:03,493 --> 00:58:05,900
Rym: Well, I I kind of scan my way into that job.

963
00:58:05,961 --> 00:58:07,596
Rym: So you want to hear you want to learn like Rym?

964
00:58:08,542 --> 00:58:10,651
Rym: Messing with people like here's a case.

965
00:58:10,671 --> 00:58:14,772
Scott: I got my jobs like going into interviews and saying yeah Look, I actually know what the hell I'm talking about.

966
00:58:14,893 --> 00:58:15,738
Scott: I obviously do.

967
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:16,484
Scott: I hope.

968
00:58:16,565 --> 00:58:17,939
Scott: I hope people believe I know about.

969
00:58:18,442 --> 00:58:27,380
Rym: I went right from listening to Monday episode to the career fair at RIT and Applied to an IBM co-op job that I was not qualified.

970
00:58:27,761 --> 00:58:34,398
Scott: The only job I apply I talked to when I was at that RIT career fair was a computer associates And I don't think she wanted to talk to me.

971
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:38,380
Scott: But my RA was like, oh man, you should totally talk to this guy.

972
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:40,407
Scott: So she talked to me and I interviewed with her.

973
00:58:40,848 --> 00:58:43,477
Scott: but she was like, why'd you fail calculus?

974
00:58:43,517 --> 00:58:44,340
Scott: three like twice?

975
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:45,390
Scott: I'm like cuz it's really hard.

976
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:46,400
Scott: You can't pass calculus.

977
00:58:47,201 --> 00:58:48,085
Scott: I'm like, I don't think so.

978
00:58:48,105 --> 00:58:51,160
Scott: and just like hire me anyway, and they didn't so like alright, whatever.

979
00:58:51,301 --> 00:58:55,720
Rym: So I only applied to jobs for the co-op because remember I needed a co-op like real bad to graduate.

980
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:57,554
Rym: You gotta get your first co-op in like your second year.

981
00:58:57,594 --> 00:58:58,319
Rym: You're fucked at RIT.

982
00:58:58,400 --> 00:58:59,425
Scott: Yeah, I think that's the thing with our.

983
00:58:59,486 --> 00:59:01,215
Rym: it's so hard to get a co-op right.

984
00:59:01,235 --> 00:59:06,600
Scott: getting the co-op is hard But once you get one, it's like there's a reason they have that program because it's like if you have a job.

985
00:59:06,701 --> 00:59:14,300
Scott: it's like the rate of Graduated from RIT with a like a computer related degree to getting a job is like a super high rate.

986
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:14,562
Scott: It's like 90%.

987
00:59:14,562 --> 00:59:17,399
Scott: also because the retention rate was so low.

988
00:59:17,687 --> 00:59:24,060
Rym: Yeah So I applied to jobs that were kind of minimum GPA requirement cuz I had a really high GPA back then.

989
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:25,146
Rym: Yeah, it was so bad.

990
00:59:25,186 --> 00:59:27,338
Rym: I was like 3.9 before I took over the anime club.

991
00:59:27,539 --> 00:59:28,326
Scott: Yes I got a drop.

992
00:59:28,447 --> 00:59:37,903
Scott: I didn't give a shit about grades But somehow my first quarter ever at RIT was like almost all A's and my last quarter at RIT I got like the Dean's list and in between it was like failed calculus 3.

993
00:59:37,903 --> 00:59:41,557
Scott: Well, I had the same degree with a 2.0 that you get with a 3.0.

994
00:59:41,557 --> 00:59:45,800
Rym: It doesn't matter I had to maintain a 3.4 minimum or I lost my full ride.

995
00:59:46,121 --> 00:59:47,264
Rym: I lost my scholarship.

996
00:59:47,585 --> 00:59:52,240
Scott: my scholarship slightly moved up and down a little bit over time, but they never completely removed it.

997
00:59:52,601 --> 00:59:54,733
Scott: So well, they were like, alright, we're getting $100 less.

998
00:59:54,753 --> 00:59:55,095
Scott: I'm like shit.

999
00:59:56,140 --> 01:00:00,080
Rym: So I applied to an IBM co-op job to be a database administrator.

1000
01:00:01,181 --> 01:00:07,227
Rym: Now I point out I took the database class at RIT and decided that I fucking hated databases And I was not like.

1001
01:00:07,287 --> 01:00:09,039
Rym: I know SQL like you just know SQL.

1002
01:00:09,381 --> 01:00:12,635
Scott: I know SQL but I couldn't make my whole job databases and nothing but database.

1003
01:00:12,655 --> 01:00:19,039
Rym: Yeah, like I could not actually Normalize a database nor did I know anything about Oracle one class and that was like hell.

1004
01:00:19,079 --> 01:00:19,180
Scott: no.

1005
01:00:19,622 --> 01:00:24,508
Rym: So I applied to the job despite being abjectly Non-qualified for it.

1006
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:34,739
Rym: and then when I went to the interview I wore a nice suit but it wasn't this like the like I wore like a Deep blue shirt and I had my basically made sure that I stood out like I kept my earrings in.

1007
01:00:35,221 --> 01:00:36,868
Rym: My resume was like four pages.

1008
01:00:36,888 --> 01:00:40,723
Rym: I'd like just I wanted to stand out and I figured out.

1009
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:45,939
Rym: I remembered who the people who were behind the booth at IBM's booth at they like the thing looked like.

1010
01:00:46,583 --> 01:00:49,880
Rym: So I hung out in the area where the interview was happening.

1011
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:56,300
Rym: There's like a little waiting area at RIT where they do the co-op interviews Like the companies come in and do the interviews the week after the job fair.

1012
01:00:57,002 --> 01:01:16,327
Rym: So I hung around there like an hour before my interview and I started making small talk with other people who were waiting in line for the same job interviews at IBM and I basically waited for someone I could talk kind of loudly to about like oh scholarships And what's it like at RIT and how's your GPA?

1013
01:01:16,889 --> 01:01:21,040
Rym: and I use this as an excuse to talk a lot about my full ride.

1014
01:01:21,562 --> 01:01:27,228
Rym: How I'm only here for the piece of paper because I already know everything and IT is so easy Like this stuff's baby stuff.

1015
01:01:27,630 --> 01:01:36,400
Rym: and the guy I was talking to Was like a mirror sort of reflecting the conversation back at me and I made sure those people I recognized before were within earshot.

1016
01:01:37,282 --> 01:01:38,656
Rym: then I go into the interview.

1017
01:01:38,677 --> 01:01:41,106
Rym: I Very I'm very like.

1018
01:01:41,146 --> 01:01:45,968
Rym: I don't lie and I basically when they ask about database stuff I admit I do not have any of that.

1019
01:01:46,551 --> 01:01:47,474
Rym: and the end of the interview.

1020
01:01:47,936 --> 01:01:53,492
Rym: I actually said, you know what I Would like to rescind my own application like as much as I need a co-op.

1021
01:01:53,954 --> 01:01:58,240
Rym: I'm not qualified for this particular job So I will apply to you like I'm backing out.

1022
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:04,396
Rym: so Because I did all that IBM called me like they kept my resume around.

1023
01:02:04,417 --> 01:02:06,485
Rym: cuz the guy was like, oh well Keep your resume on file.

1024
01:02:06,967 --> 01:02:07,529
Rym: and they did.

1025
01:02:07,650 --> 01:02:11,319
Rym: and then they called me and offered me a completely different job within a couple weeks.

1026
01:02:12,761 --> 01:02:14,028
Rym: That was a lot of work.

1027
01:02:14,088 --> 01:02:17,425
Rym: to get that job because I wouldn't have got it Otherwise, I don't know what I would have done.

1028
01:02:18,048 --> 01:02:20,479
Rym: But once I got that job some other crappy idea.

1029
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:26,319
Rym: Maybe it's hard to get it jobs A lot of people couldn't get co-ops and like had trouble could have gone straight to the hospital step one.

1030
01:02:27,303 --> 01:02:28,548
Rym: I don't know if I that might have.

1031
01:02:28,569 --> 01:02:31,100
Rym: just I might have just quit and become a lawyer if that happened.

1032
01:02:32,442 --> 01:02:37,544
Rym: But once I got that job and I went in it's like oh the real world IT is Super easy.

1033
01:02:37,584 --> 01:02:44,307
Scott: if you know anything about computers, this job is like I'm having to teach all my co-workers Unix because like nobody knows you Nick.

1034
01:02:45,110 --> 01:02:46,413
Scott: It's like nobody knows.

1035
01:02:46,454 --> 01:02:47,296
Scott: they all have Macs.

1036
01:02:47,396 --> 01:02:48,580
Scott: They all have Unix computers.

1037
01:02:49,363 --> 01:02:51,260
Scott: No one actually knows any Unix anything.

1038
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:55,757
Scott: So it's like I think I might have to even make like Unix YouTube videos like learn Unix with Scott or some shit.

1039
01:02:55,838 --> 01:03:01,818
Rym: when I showed Someone the T command once it blew their mind like everything is a file.

1040
01:03:01,858 --> 01:03:02,540
Scott: That's all you need to know.

1041
01:03:02,620 --> 01:03:05,391
Scott: It's files like what my co-work today was like.

1042
01:03:05,432 --> 01:03:06,375
Scott: he actually knew stuff.

1043
01:03:06,396 --> 01:03:07,480
Scott: He was like, do I have to chamad?

1044
01:03:07,660 --> 01:03:09,988
Scott: I'm like, yes, he's like, yeah, it's like what it's like.

1045
01:03:10,029 --> 01:03:11,072
Scott: What do I have to chamad?

1046
01:03:11,132 --> 01:03:13,240
Scott: I'm like just make it 700.

1047
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:15,469
Scott: He's like, alright, I'm like, do you know what the numbers mean?

1048
01:03:15,831 --> 01:03:16,292
Scott: He's like.

1049
01:03:16,614 --> 01:03:18,140
Scott: it's like RWX or something.

1050
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:20,612
Scott: I'm like, oh my god, you know more than all the other coworkers.

1051
01:03:20,633 --> 01:03:23,287
Rym: Yeah, that guy is already On the road is to die.

1052
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:25,845
Scott: But then I was like, do you know why?

1053
01:03:25,905 --> 01:03:29,159
Scott: it's the number seven and he's like no bitch if bitch shifter.

1054
01:03:29,661 --> 01:03:33,737
Scott: And I'm like, it's simultaneously really awesome and really stupid.

1055
01:03:33,938 --> 01:03:36,420
Rym: Yep And DP is the same thing.

1056
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:43,043
Rym: There's there's one register that just has all these bits in a row and ever and it just shifts to the left and ones mean It's working.

1057
01:03:43,104 --> 01:03:46,160
Rym: Well sevens meet ones mean is working and zero means it's not working.

1058
01:03:46,462 --> 01:03:49,979
Rym: But the actual number you get will be like three seven seven, which means it's all ones.

1059
01:03:51,209 --> 01:04:00,369
Scott: So Because it's not as long as you think it oh, it's only yeah Yeah, anyway Eight instead of nine bytes or whatever.

1060
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:02,037
Rym: people who know this bits.

1061
01:04:02,359 --> 01:04:11,938
Rym: Yeah It's people who know like like people who know what a subnet mask actually is Like why that is the way it is You're unicorns.

1062
01:04:12,801 --> 01:04:14,027
Rym: So I guess the moral is.

1063
01:04:14,107 --> 01:04:16,860
Scott: I think the IT guys at my place know what this subnet mask is.

1064
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:18,205
Scott: I don't think the programmers know.

1065
01:04:18,265 --> 01:04:28,383
Rym: if you go to a real computer school and you already know about computers Like the classes are not teaching you the useful stuff unless you're a programmer they might be but an IT They're definitely not.

1066
01:04:28,885 --> 01:04:35,069
Rym: just get any IT job and you'll be badass at it probably and if you're not You'll learn because you already know a lot of this stuff.

1067
01:04:35,089 --> 01:04:37,818
Rym: if you know computers just get one job and notice.

1068
01:04:37,859 --> 01:04:45,359
Rym: as soon as I Had that one IBM job the people who previously wouldn't talk to me Fell over themselves offering me jobs and nothing had changed.

1069
01:04:45,762 --> 01:05:03,168
Scott: My advice is that most jobs out there if you need a job in technology Most of the jobs are looking for a specific technology for you to know right like where you want to hire someone who knows X. So what you need to do is just look at what's hot out there right and learn one hot thing Whatever it is.

1070
01:05:03,188 --> 01:05:06,833
Scott: Yep, and then Get a job doing that one hot thing, right?

1071
01:05:06,853 --> 01:05:08,060
Rym: You don't have to learn it to be an expert.

1072
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:11,214
Rym: You have to learn enough to pass the interview and know what that like.

1073
01:05:11,515 --> 01:05:13,745
Rym: say someone needs a Windows admin Like you got to know kind of how.

1074
01:05:13,785 --> 01:05:14,508
Rym: Active Directory right?

1075
01:05:14,528 --> 01:05:16,999
Scott: So for example, the first job I got was PHP my SQL.

1076
01:05:17,402 --> 01:05:22,447
Scott: But it's like yeah, I had set up I you know I've done a little bit of that in college.

1077
01:05:22,567 --> 01:05:25,319
Scott: and then the second job I got was also PHP my SQL.

1078
01:05:25,944 --> 01:05:36,168
Scott: But towards the end of the job of the shady place We started messing around with git and Django and so when I got a job at Broadway calm I was like I've done the Django tutorial But now I'm a Django master.

1079
01:05:36,188 --> 01:05:39,460
Scott: you get all your skills at specific skills at your job.

1080
01:05:39,541 --> 01:05:40,973
Scott: You just need the general skills.

1081
01:05:41,074 --> 01:05:45,952
Scott: Yeah elsewhere What sucks to learn is what you need to learn like real talk.

1082
01:05:46,072 --> 01:05:48,720
Rym: RIT did not give me those base computer skills.

1083
01:05:49,021 --> 01:05:50,687
Rym: I always I hardly use any.

1084
01:05:50,768 --> 01:05:54,000
Scott: the only thing I learned at RIT was Unix, which I learned on my own.

1085
01:05:54,261 --> 01:05:55,204
Scott: They didn't teach it to me.

1086
01:05:55,285 --> 01:06:01,627
Scott: I just happened to learn it while I was there because I had to yep same deal, but Basically are like people.

1087
01:06:01,667 --> 01:06:03,254
Rym: graduating from RIT wasn't so much.

1088
01:06:03,295 --> 01:06:04,259
Rym: they learned a lot about IT.

1089
01:06:04,982 --> 01:06:09,640
Rym: It was they were smart enough to make it through IT to get the piece of paper.

1090
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:13,228
Rym: So yeah, that's that's job.

1091
01:06:13,308 --> 01:06:14,895
Scott: Hope to get a piece of paper.

1092
01:06:14,915 --> 01:06:16,100
Scott: You need to have money to begin with.

1093
01:06:16,462 --> 01:06:18,720
Rym: Oh, and I worked at that temp agency, but I've talked about that on keep nice.

1094
01:06:18,860 --> 01:06:19,182
Rym: I'm just so.

1095
01:06:19,202 --> 01:06:25,613
Scott: if you're a privileged white dude who grows up in the suburbs and goes to a good high school and has a Computer when you're growing up in the 90s.

1096
01:06:25,654 --> 01:06:34,287
Scott: Yeah you too Get enough get a job good enough to live in New York City And get money and technology.

1097
01:06:34,828 --> 01:06:35,631
Scott: you miss the boat.

1098
01:06:35,751 --> 01:06:36,874
Scott: I'm sorry Millennials.

1099
01:06:37,276 --> 01:06:38,700
Scott: Yeah, I can't do anything about it.

1100
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:45,300
Scott: What do you I mean like yeah, I admit that that's the situation But would you like me to like would you would not do any differently in my shoes?

1101
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:46,204
Scott: I mean like I gotta eat.

1102
01:06:46,224 --> 01:06:46,989
Scott: What do you want me to do?

1103
01:06:47,110 --> 01:06:48,840
Scott: my advice to you give you my job.

1104
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,168
Scott: I don't want to sit at the desk all day.

1105
01:06:50,188 --> 01:06:52,180
Scott: You can have it, but I don't know if you can do it.

1106
01:06:52,782 --> 01:07:00,327
Rym: My advice to you is like Scott said learn some of these things like learn the shit out of Linux and Then you just have to scan.

1107
01:07:00,368 --> 01:07:02,880
Scott: if you actually fucking know Unix like I will hire you.

1108
01:07:03,001 --> 01:07:04,020
Scott: I need you yeah.

1109
01:07:04,101 --> 01:07:12,230
Rym: And once you if you know Linux like or Unix real well Then even if you don't have the pieces of paper or anything You've just got to pull some like what I did an IBM.

1110
01:07:12,270 --> 01:07:15,000
Rym: pull some bullshit to just get in the door.

1111
01:07:15,541 --> 01:07:18,129
Rym: Impress the people who are interviewing because they're usually people like me.

1112
01:07:18,170 --> 01:07:24,833
Rym: and Scott once you get past that HR wall where I'm just like Do you know what the fixed protocol is?

1113
01:07:25,033 --> 01:07:26,539
Rym: do you know what regular expressions are?

1114
01:07:27,461 --> 01:07:29,527
Rym: Write down a regular expression for me.

1115
01:07:29,547 --> 01:07:30,570
Rym: anyone.

1116
01:07:30,590 --> 01:07:32,316
Rym: write down a regular expression.

1117
01:07:32,356 --> 01:07:33,439
Rym: I'll hire you right now.

1118
01:07:34,462 --> 01:07:41,960
Scott: So if your regular expression can actually match something like here make a regular expression that matches a file name and extracts the file extension.

1119
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:43,444
Scott: You got your hired.

1120
01:07:43,624 --> 01:07:44,848
Rym: whoa capture group Scott.

1121
01:07:44,868 --> 01:07:47,775
Rym: That is where you do that one capture group.

1122
01:07:48,196 --> 01:07:50,222
Scott: You are immediately hired Scott.

1123
01:07:50,323 --> 01:08:02,592
Rym: I've explained capture groups to a dozen people in the last year being people who currently work for you and are being paid or people who work for other companies doing the same kind of and they Don't know how to do this and they don't understand it.

1124
01:08:02,914 --> 01:08:08,959
Rym: the other the other argument I've gotten from people in this industry in Wall Street finance is me blah blah blah blah.

1125
01:08:09,622 --> 01:08:12,215
Rym: Let's let people just set a regular expression for this thing.

1126
01:08:12,657 --> 01:08:15,046
Rym: counter argument No one knows regular expressions.

1127
01:08:15,086 --> 01:08:15,468
Scott: regular.

1128
01:08:15,568 --> 01:08:16,692
Scott: is it my rebuttal.

1129
01:08:16,772 --> 01:08:18,920
Rym: No you just don't know regular expressions.

1130
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:33,178
Scott: But I mean it a. regular expressions are often are a tool that is often used for jobs that it should not be used for Hammer used to hit many screws, but you need to only bring it out when you know you've got nails.

1131
01:08:33,377 --> 01:08:43,337
Rym: if you know how to navigate a command line Like basic like babies first Linux, and you know how to use grep with regular expressions you can do 90% of all IT work.

1132
01:08:50,245 --> 01:08:52,779
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1133
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:57,696
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1138
01:09:48,238 --> 01:09:55,756
Rym: They give us Nicholas Brandau Rebecca Dunn James David white Christian coons Jess mechanical mind testing.

1139
01:09:55,957 --> 01:10:25,680
Rym: one two three Phil Ulrich Amanda Doucette Renee from New Zealand Robert Lee Ryan Perrin drew up and Lander rare Lavell Brian Cedroni Rochelle, Monta Nona Finn Eric silver odd Rym eats poop Kinetic man William Eisen rose Aaron Cerise Chris midkiff Chris Knox flame dark fire Samuel Cordery Daniel Redman Chris Haddad Doug Snyder Sean Klein Chris Reimer and Thomas Hahn.

1140
01:10:26,363 --> 01:10:30,240
Rym: Also, I actually was finally called out on pronouncing someone's name wrong.

1141
01:10:30,541 --> 01:10:36,903
Rym: So it is Doucette's and you are the winner of the prize of being the first person to actually call me out and getting someone's name wrong.

1142
01:10:37,809 --> 01:10:39,340
Rym: and beyond that stay tuned.

1143
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:50,759
Rym: Like I said, there's gonna be some more rooms ran some special episodes some things coming up, especially on the holidays we will be doing a normal episode of GeekNights on Christmas Eve and it's gonna be Christmas related.

1144
01:10:50,779 --> 01:10:56,940
Rym: and So I leave you with your moment of as always literally the opposite of that.

1145
01:10:57,707 --> 01:11:00,514
Scott: You can't shoot We'll just let it slip.

1146
01:11:00,534 --> 01:11:02,803

Rym: He opens his mouth, but spaghetti won't come out.

1154
01:11:19,208 --> 01:11:19,810
Rym: He's joking.

1155
01:11:19,870 --> 01:11:21,896
