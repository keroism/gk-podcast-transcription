1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,217
Rym: It's Wednesday, February 25th, 2015.

2
00:00:10,217 --> 00:00:10,478
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:13,985
Rym: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:15,669
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight.

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,509
Rym: Horror news and a parasite.

6
00:00:21,111 --> 00:00:22,128
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,039
Rym: So yeah, I pretty much have ignored the Oscars forever now.

8
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,060
Rym: I just have never really been super interested in them, but...

9
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,778
Scott: I mean, I'm not, you know...

10
00:00:35,084 --> 00:00:35,638
Rym: I'm not a poet!

11
00:00:36,281 --> 00:00:40,220
Scott: We could spend a whole show talking about how awards shows are garbage and worthless.

12
00:00:40,381 --> 00:00:47,678
Scott: But, you know, if you compare them all, the major ones in the United States, the Oscars are probably the worst ones.

13
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,818
Rym: Yeah, and basically I know...

14
00:00:50,101 --> 00:00:51,979
Scott: It's like, I have more respect for the other ones.

15
00:00:52,240 --> 00:01:02,059
Rym: Usually people who, like anime people who don't really pay attention to other kinds of media, like, you know, that type of person, they tend not to pay attention to this stuff because they don't expect anime to win.

16
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:11,039
Rym: And this time around, at least, the anime people actually notice that the Oscars are kind of messed up because of that guy.

17
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,500
Scott: They didn't notice the year before, the year before, the year before.

18
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:30,700
Rym: Well, because now they had that guy who was a real Oscar voter who said he voted for Big Hero 6 because he watched it with his kids and he wasn't too keen on the two Chinese movies that were in contention, which I assume he meant Song of the Sea and Princess Kaguya.

19
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,116
Scott: The way Oscars are decided, right?

20
00:01:33,682 --> 00:01:34,139
Rym: Old white men.

21
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:35,080
Scott: Is a bunch of old...

22
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,039
Rym: And they don't even watch them.

23
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:38,760
Scott: 90% of the people who vote are old white dudes.

24
00:01:38,921 --> 00:01:40,660
Scott: They're not required to watch every movie.

25
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,310
Scott: They just get these free screener copies and they just vote.

26
00:01:44,652 --> 00:01:51,339
Scott: and they're members of the Academy, whoever the fuck they are, and they can vote or even abstain on categories that they don't give a shit.

27
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,279
Rym: They vote pretty randomly?

28
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,660
Scott: And it's just a bunch of old white American dudes and they just decide.

29
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,955
Scott: It doesn't, you know, and then people are like, "Oh, I'm so thankful I won this

30
00:02:00,016 --> 00:02:00,400
Scott: award.".

31
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:15,079
Scott: It's like, as far as I'm concerned, if you win an Oscar, nowadays or ever, that might even mean your movie is worse because it's a movie that old white American dudes prefer for whatever reason, which means it's probably not the best movie.

32
00:02:15,721 --> 00:02:19,379
Rym: But just literally those two Chinese movies.

33
00:02:20,622 --> 00:02:21,808
Scott: Old white?

34
00:02:22,412 --> 00:02:31,279
Scott: Why do people... It seems like 90% of the conversations, period, that occur are, "Wow, look at how stupid people

35
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:31,520
Scott: are.".

36
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,840
Scott: And it's like, "Yeah, I've realized how stupid people are since last millennia.

37
00:02:36,021 --> 00:02:39,518
Scott: I don't need to keep discussing it in 90% of conversations

38
00:02:39,638 --> 00:02:39,799
Scott: ever.".

39
00:02:40,543 --> 00:02:46,418
Scott: If all you have to say is, "Wow, here's another example of how stupid, evil, et cetera, people are,".

40
00:02:46,961 --> 00:02:50,198
Scott: why even bother saying it or thinking about it?

41
00:02:51,843 --> 00:02:53,640
Scott: Just shut up and let's talk about something else.

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,938
Rym: George Carlin said this.

43
00:02:55,561 --> 00:02:59,499
Rym: Some other comedians may have also said this, but imagine the average person.

44
00:03:00,064 --> 00:03:01,339
Rym: It's pretty fucking dumb, right?

45
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:04,100
Rym: Half of people are dumber than that.

46
00:03:04,201 --> 00:03:04,658
Scott: That's right.

47
00:03:07,122 --> 00:03:09,600
Rym: So, I don't have any news because there's not a lot of news.

48
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:15,339
Rym: I mean, yeah, we're going to be at Anime Boston, but we have no idea what our schedule is going to be, so we can't really talk about it much yet.

49
00:03:15,901 --> 00:03:22,360
Rym: We're going to be at Zenkai Con, and we know our schedule, but we were told we're not allowed to talk about it yet, but we'll be there doing a whole bunch of panels.

50
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,080
Scott: I think they just don't want us because it might change and whatever.

51
00:03:25,341 --> 00:03:25,758
Scott: Yeah, guys.

52
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,920
Scott: It's not like there's anything super secret on the Zenkai Con schedule.

53
00:03:30,968 --> 00:03:43,000
Rym: But it's not metamoment because I'm not talking about us, not GeekNights, but I point out that with Kinetic Con, I made a bunch of schedule changes, and we'll just move stuff around live months and months and months before the con.

54
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,459
Rym: Like, yeah, the schedule's going to change.

55
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:49,499
Rym: Why hide it from you until two weeks before, and then pretend that schedules don't change, guys?

56
00:03:50,243 --> 00:03:51,740
Rym: Why does every con do it wrong?

57
00:03:54,764 --> 00:04:02,480
Rym: Anyway, so, yeah, we got all that stuff coming up, but no real news there, and I actually have been watching a ton of anime.

58
00:04:03,662 --> 00:04:09,260
Rym: In fact, I paid for the Funimation streaming site and paid for Crunchyroll.

59
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,440
Scott: I paid for Crunchyroll, not paying for Funimation.

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:21,857
Rym: The thing is, all the new anime I want to watch, other than Yoah Pedal, is on Funimation, and you know what else is on Funimation that I never actually finished watching and I really want to see the rest of?

61
00:04:22,665 --> 00:04:23,179
Rym: Fujiko Mine.

62
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:23,809
Rym: Alright.

63
00:04:25,082 --> 00:04:31,320
Scott: I've got like 10 or 12 shows in my Crunchyroll queue that I have not finished watching or still coming out.

64
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:36,120
Rym: You should skip all of those and just watch Yurikuma Arashi.

65
00:04:36,645 --> 00:04:37,380
Scott: Um, alright.

66
00:04:37,921 --> 00:04:38,557
Scott: Here I am.

67
00:04:39,021 --> 00:04:47,640
Rym: So, that show, Emily and I watched the first episode, and we didn't pay for the streaming, so we watched it, you know, with commercials and, you know, low resolution.

68
00:04:48,323 --> 00:04:49,360
Scott: Oh, just get the torrent.

69
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:50,024
Rym: Eh.

70
00:04:50,983 --> 00:04:52,640
Scott: Here's a pro tip for people.

71
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,858
Scott: There's a fan subber out there called Horrible Subs, and you know what Horrible Subs does?

72
00:04:58,542 --> 00:05:09,020
Scott: They rip videos straight from the Funimation website with everything intact, not even trying to hide it, and they put it straight on BitTorrent in full quality.

73
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:15,859
Rym: So much for every argument everyone ever made about why they watch fan subs and how it's not illegal or immoral to do so.

74
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:20,779
Scott: I've downloaded many a Horrible Subs torrent, and I don't give a shit.

75
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,400
Rym: So anyway, we watched one episode of it because, for those of you who don't know, the show is also called Love Bullet.

76
00:05:26,943 --> 00:05:36,199
Rym: The name basically translates to Lesbian Bearstorm, and looking at it just from the outside, like, looking at pictures of what it is.

77
00:05:36,522 --> 00:05:37,057
Scott: I see bears.

78
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,880
Rym: Yeah, descriptions of what it is.

79
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,820
Scott: I see Ikuhara.

80
00:05:40,281 --> 00:05:42,440
Rym: Well, the fact that it's called Lesbian Bearstorm.

81
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,940
Scott: I mean, Ikuhara brings lesbians along all the way.

82
00:05:44,940 --> 00:06:02,859
Rym: You know, talking about judging anime by their cover, it's the kind of show that a discerning person, like myself or Scott, would have ignored out of hand, but for the fact that it is directed by Kunihiko Ikuhara, the same crazy dude who made Utena and Penguin Drum happen.

83
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:07,860
Rym: And that was pretty much the only reason I was going to give this show a shot.

84
00:06:09,087 --> 00:06:20,719
Rym: We watched episode one, and it was half really weird in that Ikuhara way, and half really weird in a, I don't want to say perverted, but kind of porny way.

85
00:06:21,624 --> 00:06:22,520
Rym: So, I'm going to look at each other.

86
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,259
Scott: So, an Ikuhara way.

87
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:23,923
Rym: Mmm.

88
00:06:24,741 --> 00:06:29,399
Rym: So, take some aspects of the Utena movie, dial it up a notch.

89
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:31,119
Scott: So, Ikuhara, yeah.

90
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:32,332
Rym: Yeah, up though.

91
00:06:32,515 --> 00:06:32,839
Rym: Up though.

92
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:33,797
Rym: You haven't seen...

93
00:06:33,961 --> 00:06:35,640
Scott: I mean, it was a long time ago.

94
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,116
Scott: He's had time to ferment.

95
00:06:38,025 --> 00:06:38,500
Rym: He's prepared.

96
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,240
Rym: The way before him has been prepared.

97
00:06:40,523 --> 00:06:41,640
Scott: He's been fermenting for a while.

98
00:06:42,823 --> 00:06:48,718
Rym: So, then we had other stuff going on, and I come back home from that ski trip, and I'm like, "So, you want to watch more of that Lesbian Bear

99
00:06:48,739 --> 00:06:48,900
Rym: show?".

100
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,591
Rym: And she's like, "Okay, I

101
00:06:49,631 --> 00:06:49,774
Rym: guess.".

102
00:06:50,424 --> 00:06:55,400
Rym: And we watch another episode, and it's really, really, really good.

103
00:06:56,281 --> 00:07:01,919
Rym: And I immediately paid for Funimation, and we've been watching it, like, immediately after it comes out.

104
00:07:02,701 --> 00:07:06,740
Rym: I'm not going to spoil anything about it other than, yes, it has lesbians.

105
00:07:07,481 --> 00:07:12,100
Rym: Yes, some of the lesbians, but not all of them, are literally bears.

106
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:32,798
Rym: Like, the plot is basically the Wall of Severance, which is all capital letters, darker than black style, has separated the world of humans from the world of bears because a planet, Camellia, or a star, blew up a long time ago, and dust from that star rained down on the Earth and woke up all the bears, and the bears started eating people because that's what they do.

107
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,840
Scott: Is it from stars because, like, Ursa of Major and Minor?

108
00:07:36,901 --> 00:07:37,214
Rym: Maybe.

109
00:07:39,384 --> 00:07:40,740
Scott: I've already seen through everything.

110
00:07:41,641 --> 00:07:44,620
Rym: Every character, every scene, everything, gets a subtitle.

111
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,717
Scott: There's not really that many other animals in space that aren't, like, crabs or scorpions.

112
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:56,231
Rym: So there'll be, like, the name of a school, and the subtitle will say "Place," or sometimes it'll say "Two Weeks Ago," and the subtitle will say

113
00:07:56,575 --> 00:07:57,080
Rym: "Flashback.".

114
00:07:57,181 --> 00:07:59,060
Rym: So every scene has, like, a name.

115
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:02,700
Rym: Every person has, like, a formal taxonomical name.

116
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:08,738
Rym: There are two kinds of beings in the world to this point, eight episodes in.

117
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,539
Rym: There are bears, and there are yuris.

118
00:08:13,282 --> 00:08:13,407
Scott: Okay.

119
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,539
Rym: Yuris are girls who may or may not be bears.

120
00:08:16,781 --> 00:08:21,719
Rym: So there's no dudes who aren't -- There are, in fact, no men in the show.

121
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:22,236
Rym: There you go.

122
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:28,320
Rym: Until the most recent episode, the most, most recent one, one man appeared.

123
00:08:28,685 --> 00:08:28,995
Scott: Is he a bear?

124
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,030
Rym: We had -- No.

125
00:08:31,063 --> 00:08:32,460
Rym: I do not believe he was a bear.

126
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:37,120
Scott: Is he a Orion with a belt with three stars on it?

127
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:40,280
Rym: He was wearing high heels and pretty sure voice-acted by a woman.

128
00:08:40,681 --> 00:08:41,349
Scott: So it was him?

129
00:08:44,467 --> 00:08:46,400
Rym: It was basically Proto Akio.

130
00:08:48,826 --> 00:08:52,199
Rym: Hard to say, but that was the first male character in the show.

131
00:08:52,721 --> 00:08:59,996
Rym: Other than, there are three bears known as the Judgemens, and they preside over the yuri court, and they approve yuri.

132
00:09:00,962 --> 00:09:01,815
Rym: Shabba da doo.

133
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:09,260
Rym: They're basically Toga, Little Toga, and Mickey crossed with Ruka Toga.

134
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,139
Scott: Okay, whatever.

135
00:09:10,946 --> 00:09:19,499
Rym: The show is really great, and it's about bullying, it's about lesbianism, it's about -- Bears?

136
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,778
Rym: Bears, kind of.

137
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,369
Scott: Hey, Yogi.

138
00:09:23,702 --> 00:09:24,120
Scott: Made of boo-boo.

139
00:09:25,842 --> 00:09:26,799
Rym: Honestly, I'll say this.

140
00:09:27,283 --> 00:09:30,579
Rym: If you're new to anime, like, if you haven't watched a lot of anime, don't watch the show.

141
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,879
Rym: The show is not -- The show is a little too advanced for you.

142
00:09:34,884 --> 00:09:46,060
Rym: It's also a show where, if you're gonna watch it in a place where your doesn't-watch-anime parents may happen into the room, I would suggest not watching it in that situation.

143
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,379
Scott: You think they'll be scared by the bears?

144
00:09:48,303 --> 00:09:52,320
Rym: Uh, the bears are actually kind of tiny and adorable, except they do just fucking kill people.

145
00:09:52,881 --> 00:09:56,379
Scott: You should do a mash-up with Hajime no Ippo, the part where he punches the bear.

146
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,720
Rym: Oh, that'd be a good mash-up.

147
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,900
Scott: The thing is, that's a full-size, like, grizzly bear.

148
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:05,600
Rym: Well, you know the karaoke song, the bear song from when they're trying to scare the bears out of that giant stomach in Adventure Time?

149
00:10:06,717 --> 00:10:06,780
Rym: Oh.

150
00:10:06,921 --> 00:10:09,220
Rym: We are bears, bears, bears, bears, bears, bears, bears.

151
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:13,198
Rym: I was gonna make an AMV to Yurikuma to that song, but someone beat me to it.

152
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,280
Scott: Have you watched some Adventure Time?

153
00:10:16,243 --> 00:10:17,560
Rym: I'm caught up on Adventure Time.

154
00:10:17,722 --> 00:10:17,938
Rym: All right.

155
00:10:18,366 --> 00:10:18,452
Rym: Yeah.

156
00:10:19,061 --> 00:10:20,299
Rym: Well, I think I am.

157
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,540
Rym: What was the last episode you saw?

158
00:10:21,801 --> 00:10:23,299
Scott: If you remind me, I'll be able to tell you.

159
00:10:24,365 --> 00:10:25,220
Rym: Okay, we'll talk after.

160
00:10:25,783 --> 00:10:27,220
Rym: We'll talk after about Adventure Time.

161
00:10:28,242 --> 00:10:29,960
Rym: We've been charging our Adventure Time laser.

162
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:34,760
Rym: There will be a show on Adventure Time, 'cause the show might be gearing up toward an end or something.

163
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:35,699
Scott: I don't know, maybe.

164
00:10:36,873 --> 00:10:37,079
Rym: So, yeah.

165
00:10:37,801 --> 00:10:44,020
Rym: Seriously, though, Lesbian Bearstorm, I really, really like it, and so does Emily.

166
00:10:44,503 --> 00:10:45,519
Rym: It's not done yet.

167
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,320
Rym: There's only a few more episodes.

168
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,759
Rym: It's only a 12-episode show.

169
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,140
Rym: However, I want to point something out.

170
00:10:51,220 --> 00:11:00,540
Rym: The most recent episode, Episode 8, like, all these plot threads came together into a ridiculous climax, and then Ikuhara did his magic.

171
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,860
Rym: A character is about to say something, and it's one of those, like, "This is the answer to the big question,".

172
00:11:07,364 --> 00:11:25,199
Rym: and then as that character is talking, thunder happens, drowning out her voice, and then a bunch of characters say a bunch of things to each other that you can't hear over the sound of the rain, and then a character shoots a gun at one of the other three characters, and you don't know which one.

173
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:31,665
Rym: The episode ended on that, and then I went on Wikipedia, and I noticed that the next episode is not Episode 9.

174
00:11:31,665 --> 00:11:36,540
Rym: The next episode of this 12-episode show is Episode 8.5.

175
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,881
Scott: I mean, the last episode is Episode 11?

176
00:11:38,881 --> 00:11:41,099
Rym: No, it's still Episode 12, as far as I can tell.

177
00:11:41,921 --> 00:11:42,508
Rym: So it's a 13-episode show?

178
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:48,560
Rym: Now I'm worried that Episode 9 is going to be followed by Episode 9.3333.

179
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,220
Rym: You cannot continue to be a bear.

180
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,538
Scott: You cannot bear?

181
00:11:53,183 --> 00:11:54,059
Scott: You can't be a bear?

182
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,300
Scott: We already know you can't be a bear.

183
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,180
Rym: I am confident.

184
00:11:56,441 --> 00:11:56,858
Scott: You're a yuri.

185
00:11:58,182 --> 00:12:01,040
Rym: Well, there are no men, so I don't know if I'm a yuri.

186
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:12,899
Rym: I think yuri means human, and this is a world where there basically aren't men, which is kind of interesting, because it has sort of aggressive sexuality and complex relationships.

187
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,011
Scott: Call the Y The Last Man.

188
00:12:14,031 --> 00:12:14,639
Scott: It's been done, bro.

189
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:26,260
Rym: But because there is literally no gender at all, or sex at all, in terms of chromosomal sex, that is not a factor, because all characters are women.

190
00:12:26,681 --> 00:12:27,618
Scott: But they're still having sex.

191
00:12:28,162 --> 00:12:29,152
Rym: Yes, some of them aren't.

192
00:12:29,192 --> 00:12:29,697
Rym: Some of them aren't.

193
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:30,368
Rym: With bears.

194
00:12:33,102 --> 00:12:35,260
Rym: Yes, some people have sex with bears.

195
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,638
Scott: So it's bestiality.

196
00:12:38,229 --> 00:12:42,280
Rym: Well, remember Wolf's Rain, where they're just wolves but people see them as humans?

197
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:55,340
Rym: Part of the plot is that two of the characters are bears who snuck into the human world, disguised as humans, and they just look like people, but sometimes you see them and they're just bears.

198
00:12:56,902 --> 00:12:57,579
Rym: What do they eat?

199
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,363
Rym: People!

200
00:12:58,483 --> 00:13:00,799
Rym: There's a huge body count in this show.

201
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,000
Rym: A lot of girls get eaten by bears.

202
00:13:04,381 --> 00:13:05,300
Rym: Just killed and eaten.

203
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,899
Rym: And that's that.

204
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,634
Scott: And then the next day everyone's like, "Oh, it's their fault for tasting

205
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:08,839
Scott: good.".

206
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:09,398
Rym: Oh my god.

207
00:13:09,881 --> 00:13:11,018
Rym: A delicious smell.

208
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,214
Rym: Gao gao.

209
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,720
Rym: Goni goni goni goni.

210
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,000
Scott: Are you done talking about bears?

211
00:13:16,161 --> 00:13:17,780
Rym: No, I'm really obsessed with this show.

212
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,219
Rym: I kind of want to do a whole episode on it.

213
00:13:19,461 --> 00:13:27,820
Rym: So if you don't watch it soon, Emily and I are just going to do an episode on the whole thing, because it's just... It's my favorite anime since Kill La Kill.

214
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:28,582
Scott: Okay.

215
00:13:29,816 --> 00:13:30,100
Scott: Whatever.

216
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,720
Rym: I'm not even joking.

217
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:42,099
Scott: So in news that's not that big, but interesting, there's this guy, I think I've mentioned him on the show before, he's a comic book writer named Matt Fraction, and he's a really cool dude.

218
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,558
Scott: I just happen to be the one person who doesn't like any comics he writes.

219
00:13:46,043 --> 00:13:46,699
Rym: Eh, that happens.

220
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,779
Scott: But everyone else loves his comics.

221
00:13:50,441 --> 00:13:58,359
Scott: And his wife, Kelly Sue DeConnick, they did this comic called Sex Criminals a while ago.

222
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,079
Rym: Oh yeah, I remember that.

223
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,620
Scott: Like a year plus two years ago maybe?

224
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:12,959
Scott: I wasn't a big fan of that comic, but it has an interesting premise, which is basically there's two people, when they have sex and have an orgasm, time stops and then they can commit crimes.

225
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:32,880
Rym: I have witnessed two separate conversations, one among nerds and one among muggles, like non-nerds, where one person was attempting to describe the premise of this comic to the other person, and the other person has more incredulity than you would expect a human eyebrow to be able to express.

226
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:39,320
Scott: But anyway, they signed a deal to turn this into a TV series on some sort of TV channel.

227
00:14:40,726 --> 00:15:07,180
Scott: So that's gonna be interesting, seeing that kind of thing adapted for TV, but more interestingly is that they've actually, like their production company, they're gonna use their production company that they have created for this to turn more other comics, perhaps, by other people besides them and turn those things into TV shows since, you know, since Walking Dead and others have proven that this is a profitable pathway.

228
00:15:08,142 --> 00:15:12,900
Scott: So hopefully, other comics that we like-- It's not gonna happen with Saga.

229
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:24,320
Scott: Probably not with Saga, but there are other comics that we like, hopefully, will be turned into television shows that don't suck, you know, and are worth watching.

230
00:15:25,021 --> 00:15:29,159
Scott: Or perhaps comic books that you don't have the time to read or you don't want to read.

231
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,440
Scott: There's too many issues or something.

232
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,839
Rym: You know, at this point, what I'd really like to see is if they made a TV show that was based on the My Little Pony comic.

233
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:41,459
Rym: [ Laughter ] Let's see what I did there.

234
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,478
Scott: Let's see what you did there.

235
00:15:43,141 --> 00:15:44,835
Scott: But yeah, this is a really interesting thing.

236
00:15:44,855 --> 00:15:45,420
Scott: that's happening.

237
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,840
Scott: 'cause it's not like, you know, whatever.

238
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,131
Scott: Yeah.

239
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:53,239
Scott: And if you look at some of the, you know, the peoples involved here, right?

240
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,239
Scott: You know, it's peoples that people like.

241
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,479
Rym: It's real with real people.

242
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:56,974
Scott: Reels.

243
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,380
Rym: So things of the day.

244
00:16:06,281 --> 00:16:17,059
Rym: Many people, it is not an original joke to say, "Hey, if everyone's just, like, commenting on other people, like, watching other people play video games, and those people are just-- There's a South Park episode about this.

245
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,820
Rym: Yes, and everyone makes that joke.

246
00:16:19,341 --> 00:16:23,640
Rym: Eventually, are people just gonna be doing Let's Plays of other people doing Let's Plays?

247
00:16:23,921 --> 00:16:24,439
Rym: And you know what?

248
00:16:25,622 --> 00:16:29,040
Rym: That happened, and it's actually really, really funny.

249
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,879
Rym: So these guys, there's a gentleman on the internet-- What are the names of these guys?

250
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,260
Rym: The YouTube channel is Retsupuri.

251
00:16:37,082 --> 00:16:37,871
Scott: Alright, cool.

252
00:16:38,195 --> 00:16:38,660
Scott: Whatever, bro.

253
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,127
Rym: Yeah, I don't know.

254
00:16:39,148 --> 00:16:39,860
Rym: It's got a lot of views.

255
00:16:39,941 --> 00:16:41,459
Rym: 'cause other people seem to appreciate this.

256
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:54,594
Rym: They watch Cloud87450, who is also apparently the same gentleman as Cloud8745, do a boss rush of Super Mario Bros.

257
00:16:54,594 --> 00:16:56,759
Rym: 2 on the NES because-- Oh, the Lost Levels?

258
00:16:57,531 --> 00:16:57,719
Scott: No.

259
00:16:57,881 --> 00:16:58,559
Scott: That doesn't have bosses.

260
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,860
Rym: Doki Doki Panic Super Mario 2.

261
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,399
Scott: Oh, okay, so Super Mario 2 USA.

262
00:17:02,842 --> 00:17:04,740
Scott: Or was he actually playing Doki Doki Panic?

263
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,579
Rym: He was playing Mario 2 USA.

264
00:17:07,101 --> 00:17:10,859
Rym: Because a boss rush of the game that had some of the simplest.

265
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:12,534
Scott: I'm like, "Lost Levels does not have

266
00:17:12,594 --> 00:17:13,018
Scott: bosses.".

267
00:17:13,344 --> 00:17:13,579
Rym: Yeah.

268
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,038
Rym: Like, this was something the world was waiting for.

269
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,839
Scott: They rushed all the Koopas?

270
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:18,618
Scott: Koopas only?

271
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:30,480
Rym: So, Cloud87450 is doing his commentary, which he clearly recorded after the fact, as he boss rushes and explains the intricate strategy of throwing.

272
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:35,680
Scott: All you do in Mario 2 to beat bosses is don't get hit by their slow-ass, easy-to-dodge attacks.

273
00:17:35,782 --> 00:17:39,880
Scott: At one point-- And at an opportune moment, grab something and throw it at them.

274
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:49,636
Rym: When Cloud87450 is fighting Triclide the second time, one of the guys doing the meta let's play is like, "Wow, I'm really surprised that the solution here involved

275
00:17:49,817 --> 00:17:50,260
Rym: throwing.".

276
00:17:51,381 --> 00:17:57,103
Rym: But the moment of joy is he gets to Wart, because there aren't that many bosses in Mario 2.

277
00:17:57,103 --> 00:17:57,797
Rym: So he gets to Wart.

278
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,180
Scott: The final boss, but if you're not familiar.

279
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,792
Rym: And then one guy on the meta stream is just like, "There's four minutes

280
00:18:04,873 --> 00:18:05,177
Rym: left!".

281
00:18:05,561 --> 00:18:07,079
Scott: It doesn't take four minutes to beat Wart.

282
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,372
Rym: "There's four minutes left in this

283
00:18:08,412 --> 00:18:08,716
Rym: video!".

284
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:11,580
Scott: Like, pumpkins come out of these, like, things.

285
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:13,760
Rym: Not just pumpkins, also that weird onion guy.

286
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,660
Scott: Right, well, there's like this organ, basically.

287
00:18:15,781 --> 00:18:17,040
Scott: Like, the kind that you see in a church.

288
00:18:17,161 --> 00:18:19,259
Rym: Why does Wart have that in his room?

289
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:23,759
Scott: It's like the kind of thing the Phantom of the Opera would have, only with three big, trumpety pipes.

290
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,571
Scott: Or tuba pipes, almost.

291
00:18:25,612 --> 00:18:26,480
Scott: Like, bong, right?

292
00:18:26,681 --> 00:18:28,720
Rym: I never understood why that was there.

293
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,840
Scott: This Phantos is up top, but he doesn't move at all.

294
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,514
Scott: He's just chillin'.

295
00:18:32,841 --> 00:18:34,520
Scott: They should've made keys come out of there.

296
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,500
Scott: And if you grabbed a key by accident, Phantos would be like,

297
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,190
Scott: "Ah-ha-ha!".

298
00:18:38,881 --> 00:18:40,360
Rym: Here's how I would've made this boss fight.

299
00:18:40,701 --> 00:18:48,620
Rym: You've got to get vegetables out and throw them into Wart's mouth, but you've also got to open, like, three doors on the other side.

300
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:53,019
Scott: And you can't, like, normally you beat Phantos by running the fuck away, but you're trapped in this room.

301
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:53,553
Rym: Yeah.

302
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:57,240
Scott: Anyway, so, Phantos doesn't do anything.

303
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,499
Scott: These pumpkins come out, and you just have to catch them, and then throw them at Wart.

304
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,199
Scott: It's not hard.

305
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,799
Rym: There's four minutes left, dude.

306
00:19:05,684 --> 00:19:06,880
Scott: What is he doing for four minutes?

307
00:19:07,121 --> 00:19:08,140
Scott: Is he gonna watch the credits?

308
00:19:09,322 --> 00:19:19,400
Rym: So, I recommend you watch this, because it proves that, yes, it is in fact possible to do a live stream of someone else's live stream and make it entertaining.

309
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,214
Scott: Well, it's a non-live stream of a non-live.

310
00:19:22,917 --> 00:19:23,420
Scott: let's play.

311
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,240
Rym: I'm kind of thinking, like, me and Scott should do a commentary on this video.

312
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,719
Scott: Download someone else's let's play, and then do a non-live commentary of it.

313
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:31,110
Rym: Yeah.

314
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:35,815
Scott: Or do a commentary of this meta commentary.

315
00:19:36,056 --> 00:19:37,160
Scott: that's going double meta.

316
00:19:38,184 --> 00:19:39,459
Rym: Interesting things could happen there.

317
00:19:39,801 --> 00:19:41,759
Scott: We should do a riff-tracks of a riff-tracks.

318
00:19:42,243 --> 00:19:43,171
Rym: Woah, dog.

319
00:19:43,212 --> 00:19:44,200
Rym: Don't go all Inception on me now.

320
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,856
Scott: Let's take a riff-tracks and be like, "That joke was

321
00:19:45,896 --> 00:19:46,199
Scott: lame.".

322
00:19:46,341 --> 00:19:46,679
Scott: Yo, dog.

323
00:19:46,741 --> 00:19:47,999
Scott: You guys could do better next time.

324
00:19:48,481 --> 00:19:49,478
Scott: Oh, that was such a good one.

325
00:19:50,362 --> 00:19:52,158
Scott: Oh, yeah, guys totally get it.

326
00:19:55,741 --> 00:20:01,160
Scott: All right, so, speaking of meta and live streaming and whatnot, this is dude.

327
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,460
Scott: He's a Counter-Strike live streaming dude.

328
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,319
Scott: He's way better at Counter-Strike than either of us.

329
00:20:05,502 --> 00:20:05,589
Scott: Yeah.

330
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:09,380
Scott: And he has a brother, and the brother is not good at Counter-Strike.

331
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,057
Scott: Maybe not even as good as us.

332
00:20:12,562 --> 00:20:18,020
Scott: And on the guy who's good at Counter-Strike's birthday, the not good at Counter-Strike brother wanted to get him a present.

333
00:20:19,361 --> 00:20:25,439
Scott: So, you know, he just sort of called him up, said happy birthday, agreed to a match of Counter-Strike, and they started playing some Counter-Strike.

334
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:39,860
Scott: Except little did the good Counter-Strike player know that his brother had called and hired, perhaps, or asked a legit pro Counter-Strike player to come on over to his house.

335
00:20:39,981 --> 00:20:42,980
Rym: Basically, he got an aimbot made of meat.

336
00:20:44,021 --> 00:21:03,317
Scott: So, basically, while his brother is playing, you know, and the pro guy plays, and the pro guy just goes and finds his brother and kills him, and the brother's getting all upset that somehow his other brother who sucks suddenly became way, way, way better than him, like 12 kills better than him.

337
00:21:04,323 --> 00:21:17,660
Scott: But then, as soon as the brother dies, the pro guy has to play like shit on purpose so that the good brother doesn't suspect anything and realize that the shitty brother is actually a pro.

338
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:20,339
Rym: That's probably the best moment where the guy's, like, playing like a silver.

339
00:21:20,727 --> 00:21:21,019
Scott: Yeah.

340
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,199
Rym: You really got that guy in the kneecap four times.

341
00:21:24,404 --> 00:21:29,538
Scott: So, the birthday present to the brother who loves Counter-Strike is you got to play Counter-Strike against this pro guy, right?

342
00:21:29,841 --> 00:21:32,880
Scott: So, it makes a really kind of funny, awesome video.

343
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:36,860
Scott: You should check this out and also do similar things to this.

344
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:37,539
Scott: If you can.

345
00:21:38,621 --> 00:21:41,220
Rym: So, in the moment, the Book Club book is Watership Down.

346
00:21:42,429 --> 00:21:43,160
Scott: I read another chapter.

347
00:21:43,401 --> 00:21:44,698
Rym: Make the referral link for me.

348
00:21:45,449 --> 00:21:45,840
Rym: Oh, okay.

349
00:21:46,061 --> 00:21:46,252
Rym: Okay.

350
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,020
Scott: You should try actually sending me that message digitally, so, you know.

351
00:21:51,201 --> 00:21:53,200
Rym: I just send it to you in a much more direct fashion.

352
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,499
Scott: That's not a play that I'll ever remember it.

353
00:21:56,904 --> 00:21:57,777
Rym: So, you guys.

354
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,398
Scott: Unless I do it right now.

355
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,320
Rym: So, you read another chapter, so now the rabbits are hanging out with the cult rabbits.

356
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:04,940
Rym: Weird rabbits.

357
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,219
Scott: It doesn't say that they're a cult.

358
00:22:06,942 --> 00:22:08,059
Rym: There's something up with them, though.

359
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,099
Rym: They're weird, aren't they?

360
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:09,760
Scott: They're weird.

361
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,257
Rym: Weird rabbits.

362
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:10,838
Scott: Whatever.

363
00:22:11,561 --> 00:22:14,160
Rym: Did you get to the part where they have like art and stuff in their weird world?

364
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:14,819
Scott: Yeah, they got art.

365
00:22:15,144 --> 00:22:15,229
Rym: Yeah.

366
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,277
Rym: I like how the normal rabbits don't...

367
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,960
Scott: Which Watership Down one do we want?

368
00:22:21,201 --> 00:22:22,120
Rym: Oh, you're doing it right now?

369
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,820
Scott: I guess the one that says Amazon Prime, huh?

370
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,619
Rym: Yeah, whichever one people are likely to actually buy.

371
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:28,360
Rym: So, yeah.

372
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,079
Rym: If you buy the Book Club book through the Geeknight's website, Scott will get a tiny amount of money.

373
00:22:34,862 --> 00:22:36,700
Rym: That'll fund more Geeknights happening, I guess.

374
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,400
Scott: Geeknights doesn't cost money.

375
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,760
Scott: Well, it does, but it's not like it's gonna matter.

376
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,320
Rym: It costs less money than other stupid hobbies we have.

377
00:22:44,521 --> 00:22:56,580
Rym: So, in other news, at PAX East, which is like next weekend, it's coming up real quick, Friday, March 6th at 4.30 PM in the Bumblebee Theater, we are presenting What is Losing?

378
00:22:57,424 --> 00:22:58,120
Rym: It's gonna be awesome.

379
00:22:58,782 --> 00:23:00,380
Rym: And the rest of PAX, we're just gonna be hanging out.

380
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,340
Rym: And it's gonna be awesome.

381
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:01,897
Rym: You should be there.

382
00:23:03,261 --> 00:23:09,279
Rym: So, aside from lesbian bears and crazy fucking Midosuji, who I hope wins that race.

383
00:23:10,424 --> 00:23:11,620
Scott: I do not hope Midosuji wins that race.

384
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,280
Scott: Main character guy is gonna win the race.

385
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,359
Scott: It's a sports anime.

386
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:22,420
Rym: The thing is, you know what, it kind of dovetails in, because we've both been watching horror anime lately as well.

387
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,039
Rym: 'Cause, you know, we like Yamashibai.

388
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,614
Rym: There's another Yamashibai.

389
00:23:26,601 --> 00:23:29,638
Rym: I don't think season two is quite as good as season one, but it's still good, still good.

390
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:37,759
Rym: And Scott turned me on to not double hard, but horror news.

391
00:23:38,362 --> 00:23:40,976
Rym: And I've been watching Parasite with a Y.

392
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:47,179
Scott: So I was on the Crunchyroll that I pay for looking for something else to watch, and I saw this horror news, and it was short.

393
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,597
Scott: So I'm like, "All right, let's see what this is

394
00:23:48,637 --> 00:23:48,840
Scott: about.".

395
00:23:49,701 --> 00:23:51,934
Scott: And the premise of this show is amazing.

396
00:23:53,788 --> 00:23:55,460
Scott: One of the greatest-- It's so up our alley.

397
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:00,100
Scott: One of the greatest premises, conceits, for a story I've ever seen.

398
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,100
Scott: There's a kid in school, of course.

399
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:02,759
Scott: It's anime.

400
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:08,939
Scott: And at night, one night-- Well, first of all, he's in school, and he's mad skeptical and sciency, like us.

401
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:12,835
Scott: But there's, like, some girls in school who are all like, "Go, spirits,

402
00:24:13,058 --> 00:24:13,200
Scott: ooh!".

403
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,556
Scott: And he's like, "You guys are full of shit,

404
00:24:14,697 --> 00:24:14,920
Scott: whatever.".

405
00:24:16,141 --> 00:24:19,100
Scott: So he goes to bed one night, but he can't sleep.

406
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,080
Scott: He's got some insomnia.

407
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,205
Scott: -Shimbu.

408
00:24:21,225 --> 00:24:26,060
Scott: -Hey, here's someone coming down the street, and he's like, "Who the hell's going down the street, like, late at night?

409
00:24:26,101 --> 00:24:26,328
Scott: What the

410
00:24:26,348 --> 00:24:26,513
Scott: fuck?".

411
00:24:27,262 --> 00:24:30,155
Scott: And he hears them saying, "Shimbun.

412
00:24:30,557 --> 00:24:31,220
Scott: Shimbun.".

413
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:36,115
Scott: And he's like, "Why is there a newspaper being delivered at midnight?

414
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,920
Scott: That doesn't make any fucking sense.

415
00:24:39,582 --> 00:24:41,912
Scott: Who is saying that while they're running down the street at

416
00:24:41,972 --> 00:24:42,376
Scott: midnight?".

417
00:24:43,002 --> 00:24:45,640
Scott: So he goes to look, and in the window comes the newspaper.

418
00:24:46,261 --> 00:24:46,736
Scott: It's like, "Whoa!

419
00:24:46,921 --> 00:24:48,494
Scott: What the fuck is the newspaper coming in the window at

420
00:24:48,515 --> 00:24:48,800
Scott: midnight?".

421
00:24:49,381 --> 00:24:52,305
Scott: He looks at the newspaper and says, "Horror

422
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:52,448
Scott: news.".

423
00:24:53,846 --> 00:24:59,180
Scott: And it tells him horrible things that are happening in the world, including horrible things that will happen tomorrow.

424
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:02,300
Rym: Like, tomorrow, your teacher's gonna die in a car accident.

425
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,160
Scott: And tomorrow, guess what?

426
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,280
Scott: He tries to show the teacher the newspaper.

427
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,638
Scott: It turned into a regular news...paper, even though it's one he doesn't subscribe to.

428
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,060
Rym: Well, and his action kind of causes the car accident.

429
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:16,351
Scott: And the teacher gets in a car accident, and he's like, "Oh, my God,".

430
00:25:16,412 --> 00:25:17,400
Scott: and they die immediately.

431
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,240
Rym: -I like how rapidly... -And he sees a ghost coming out of the teacher's body.

432
00:25:21,481 --> 00:25:25,600
Rym: I like how rapidly the show escalates, where he's like, "Well, that's crazy,".

433
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,595
Rym: and then that girl is like, "Oh, it's the horror

434
00:25:27,636 --> 00:25:27,898
Rym: news!".

435
00:25:28,301 --> 00:25:29,720
Rym: Every time you read it, it takes, like, what?

436
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,090
Rym: -Some amount of time off your...

437
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,280
Scott: -100 days off your life.

438
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,634
Rym: -100 days off your life.

439
00:25:33,655 --> 00:25:35,740
Scott: -So, he tries... So, then, it's like, it gets good, right?

440
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,340
Scott: He's, like, trying to avoid reading it.

441
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,778
Scott: He tries to shutter the window, but the newspaper busts right the fuck in.

442
00:25:41,302 --> 00:25:43,520
Scott: And he has a teacher's stapler over at one point.

443
00:25:43,961 --> 00:25:46,540
Scott: The teacher is like, "Nothing happened.

444
00:25:46,641 --> 00:25:47,257
Scott: What is wrong with

445
00:25:47,298 --> 00:25:47,380
Scott: you?".

446
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,898
Scott: He's like, "Don't you see this newspaper right

447
00:25:48,918 --> 00:25:49,040
Scott: here?".

448
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,919
Scott: And the teacher's like, "Whoa, there is a newspaper right there.

449
00:25:51,181 --> 00:25:52,212
Scott: But it's not the horror news.

450
00:25:52,252 --> 00:25:53,020
Scott: It's the regular news.

451
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,095
Scott: But where the fuck did it come

452
00:25:54,156 --> 00:25:54,318
Scott: from?".

453
00:25:55,102 --> 00:25:57,136
Scott: And then the teacher's like, "All right, I'll tear up this

454
00:25:57,177 --> 00:25:57,640
Scott: newspaper.".

455
00:25:57,721 --> 00:26:02,780
Scott: And as soon as the teacher does that, the spirit that brought the newspaper starts to fuck with the teacher big time.

456
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:03,574
Scott: And it's like,

457
00:26:03,594 --> 00:26:03,758
Scott: "Whoa!".

458
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:07,680
Rym: That spirit is great because at one point, the spirit's like, "Oh, you don't want to read the horror news, do you?

459
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,160
Rym: Well, fuck you, I'm a ghost demon, whatever.

460
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:11,062
Scott: It's

461
00:26:11,309 --> 00:26:11,391
Scott: on.".

462
00:26:12,163 --> 00:26:15,819
Scott: The spirit that delivers the news and makes him read it is just pretty much evil.

463
00:26:17,221 --> 00:26:34,240
Scott: But, yeah, basically, what happens after the introductory stuff and you get this premise and all this awesome parts where he's figuring out the deal with the horror news, you get basically these multi-part stories that are sort of just triggered by the horror news and center around the main character but aren't about the horror news.

464
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:39,740
Scott: The first one is about going on a field trip and there's a vampire.

465
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:46,500
Scott: And it's mostly about him trying to find the vampire and the horror news just sort of gives him some tips, right?

466
00:26:46,943 --> 00:26:50,054
Scott: And the second one is about aliens, where the horror news is like, "Aliens are

467
00:26:50,074 --> 00:26:50,377
Scott: coming!".

468
00:26:50,861 --> 00:26:58,599
Scott: So then it's all about him dealing with the alien problem and the horror news doesn't really come into it very much other than sort of instigating the story of it.

469
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,656
Scott: And I haven't watched anything beyond that.

470
00:27:01,761 --> 00:27:11,078
Rym: But it's interesting because it's part of those shows where the main character is not stupid and doesn't do things too differently from what I would do, because what else can you do?

471
00:27:11,481 --> 00:27:14,440
Scott: Yeah, he's a skeptical person, but I mean, he's seen the horror news.

472
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,040
Scott: So, of course, he believes now, which you would if you saw it.

473
00:27:18,801 --> 00:27:23,934
Rym: It's like in Bocorano, where the kids are like, "This giant robot, we're a pilot,

474
00:27:23,954 --> 00:27:24,197
Rym: whatever.".

475
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,152
Rym: They're like, "Let's go to the

476
00:27:25,173 --> 00:27:25,600
Rym: military!".

477
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,059
Rym: And they go straight to the military and like,

478
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:27,160
Rym: "Look!".

479
00:27:27,201 --> 00:27:27,857
Scott: Well, eventually they go.

480
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,620
Rym: Yeah, well, as soon as they can.

481
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,880
Scott: I think one of the girls' parents is in the military or something.

482
00:27:32,121 --> 00:27:32,372
Scott: But anyway.

483
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:42,515
Scott: Yeah, so horror news is this really interesting concept at the core and the parts where they're talking about the deal with the horror news, because they do talk about it a little bit in the other stories.

484
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,000
Scott: Like in the vampire story, he's like, "I'm on a field trip.

485
00:27:46,646 --> 00:27:49,818
Scott: If the horror news doesn't get delivered, that means my family can just move

486
00:27:49,838 --> 00:27:50,000
Scott: houses.".

487
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,660
Scott: Yeah, the horror news got fucking delivered on the field trip, all right?

488
00:27:53,402 --> 00:27:54,359
Scott: You can't escape that shit.

489
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,420
Scott: What the fuck's wrong with you?

490
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,280
Rym: But he thought about it.

491
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,576
Scott: He's like, "Huh, can I get out of

492
00:27:57,616 --> 00:27:57,798
Scott: this?".

493
00:27:58,202 --> 00:28:00,740
Scott: That was like the only part where that was interesting, right?

494
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,879
Scott: Is the horror news part.

495
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:06,500
Scott: You don't really care too much about the horror, the boring, normal horror stories that go along with it.

496
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:10,978
Scott: Now, the other thing about this show is the art, which is like cheapo CG.

497
00:28:12,201 --> 00:28:14,339
Scott: It's basically like a manga that moves almost.

498
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,699
Rym: The kid makes a great face.

499
00:28:15,921 --> 00:28:21,780
Scott: Yeah, it's like they use cheapo CG to make it, and it looks like a manga.

500
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,040
Scott: There's not a lot of animation going on.

501
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:30,320
Scott: There's a lot of still frame, move the camera back and forth while sound effects play kind of stuff.

502
00:28:30,461 --> 00:28:40,160
Scott: It's very cheaply made, but if you compare it to other things that were as cheaply made, it's like the CG isn't actually bad Initial D bad.

503
00:28:40,702 --> 00:28:43,899
Scott: It's just not super expensive CG.

504
00:28:44,485 --> 00:28:45,900
Scott: You can tolerate looking at it.

505
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,780
Scott: It's not painful on the eyes.

506
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,239
Scott: It's just cheap and not expensive to make.

507
00:28:52,242 --> 00:28:55,200
Scott: Not really fancy models, but they're not bad models.

508
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:58,034
Scott: It's just like, "Oh, that guy's eyes look a little

509
00:28:58,275 --> 00:28:58,557
Scott: funny.".

510
00:28:59,341 --> 00:29:01,660
Scott: But you're not like, "Oh, this is Initial D bad.

511
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,591
Scott: It looks like a PlayStation

512
00:29:02,591 --> 00:29:03,260
Scott: 1.".

513
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:11,132
Rym: It's in the realm of horror type stuff because that deals with horror subject matter, but it's not trying to scare you.

514
00:29:11,212 --> 00:29:12,539
Rym: horror like, "Yummy, she

515
00:29:12,579 --> 00:29:12,760
Rym: bites.".

516
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,980
Scott: I'm not scared by "Yummy, she bites" either, but this doesn't even try to scare you.

517
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,800
Scott: You'd have to be like a three-year-old to be scared by horror news.

518
00:29:22,061 --> 00:29:27,057
Scott: It's more mystery, supernatural X-Files like, "Ooh, what's going to happen,

519
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:27,298
Scott: yo?".

520
00:29:28,203 --> 00:29:30,720
Rym: I've been watching Parasite with a Y.

521
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,100
Scott: It's almost closer to Scooby-Doo if you think about it.

522
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:33,580
Scott: Yeah, it kind of is.

523
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:38,079
Scott: Except instead of it being a person in a costume, it's actually the horror news.

524
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,138
Scott: It's actually a vampire.

525
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,146
Rym: "Yo, I am a demon.

526
00:29:40,328 --> 00:29:41,234
Rym: Stop trying to avoid my

527
00:29:41,275 --> 00:29:41,758
Rym: newspaper.".

528
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:42,689
Scott: Yeah.

529
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,511
Rym: "Don't you want my

530
00:29:44,551 --> 00:29:45,000
Rym: newspaper?".

531
00:29:45,123 --> 00:29:45,411
Rym: "No, well,

532
00:29:45,514 --> 00:29:45,720
Rym: tough.".

533
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,255
Scott: I think he asked the dude, he's like, "Are you a

534
00:29:47,276 --> 00:29:47,720
Scott: Shinigami?".

535
00:29:47,781 --> 00:29:48,797
Scott: He's like, "No, what the fuck's

536
00:29:48,817 --> 00:29:49,000
Scott: wrong?".

537
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:53,900
Scott: "Those only come if you're about to die," which is going to happen a lot sooner because you're reading the horror news.

538
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,180
Rym: Listen, son, you don't know shit about the spirit world.

539
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,179
Rym: Don't try to talk to me.

540
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,820
Scott: That's the reason I'm giving you the horror news.

541
00:29:59,605 --> 00:30:00,000
Scott: No front.

542
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:00,940
Rym: That's right.

543
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:11,355
Rym: So, Parasite with a Y, the maxim, is actually based on a manga from the '90s that I'd seen around occasionally, but I'd never actually read.

544
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,120
Rym: I just kind of ignored it.

545
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,600
Rym: It was one of those things you'd see sometimes.

546
00:30:16,621 --> 00:30:24,360
Scott: I've definitely known that there was an anime called Parasite with a Y, and I knew nothing else about it, and I assumed that it was a generic shounen whatever.

547
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,079
Rym: Well, it's vintage recently, like end of last year.

548
00:30:27,304 --> 00:30:27,393
Rym: Yeah.

549
00:30:27,481 --> 00:30:27,959
Rym: It's really new.

550
00:30:28,502 --> 00:30:30,580
Scott: I knew of its existence, but I did not care.

551
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:34,600
Rym: So, I've watched a bunch of it, and it's much like horror news.

552
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:43,419
Rym: It's a show where it's horror, and there's a character, the main character, who pretty much is smart and reacts to these things the best way you can.

553
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,100
Rym: Very similar protagonists in that regard.

554
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:58,600
Rym: So, the general plot is that this guy is laying in bed, and independent of that, creepy monsters are just like eating people's faces with horrible, bloody, gory body horror, like all over Japan.

555
00:30:59,261 --> 00:31:01,160
Rym: And then this guy is just like in his bedroom sleeping.

556
00:31:01,221 --> 00:31:02,920
Scott: Wait, like they're live people.

557
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,517
Scott: Their faces are just getting ripped off by ghosts.

558
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:11,213
Rym: This person is like standing there, and her husband walks over and is being all creepy, and she's like, "Well, what's

559
00:31:11,253 --> 00:31:11,577
Rym: wrong?".

560
00:31:11,921 --> 00:31:18,220
Rym: And his whole head opens up into a giant Cthulhu monster filled with teeth, just bites her head off, blood everywhere.

561
00:31:18,945 --> 00:31:19,240
Scott: All right.

562
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:22,740
Rym: And then it cuts this kid, and he's just like laying around in his bedroom.

563
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:29,720
Rym: He's asleep, and this weird alien-looking bug thing comes from the sky and starts crawling up to go up in his nose.

564
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,851
Rym: And he wakes up and goes,

565
00:31:32,133 --> 00:31:32,234
Rym: "Ah!"

566
00:31:32,254 --> 00:31:32,959
Rym: and knocks it out.

567
00:31:33,483 --> 00:31:35,820
Rym: And it lands on the floor, and he looks at it.

568
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,219
Rym: It's this scary bug thing.

569
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,580
Rym: So he doesn't want anyone to do in that situation.

570
00:31:39,741 --> 00:31:40,379
Scott: Puts it in a jar.

571
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,539
Rym: He freaks the fuck out and tries to smash it.

572
00:31:42,842 --> 00:31:43,180
Rym: Okay.

573
00:31:43,521 --> 00:31:44,778
Rym: And it attacks him.

574
00:31:45,924 --> 00:31:46,699
Scott: How big is it?

575
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,620
Rym: So it keeps trying to get a couple inches, like tiny.

576
00:31:49,982 --> 00:31:50,280
Rym: Okay.

577
00:31:50,822 --> 00:31:54,799
Rym: It keeps trying to jump in his face and in his ear, like get into his head.

578
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,340
Scott: Just put a plastic bag around here, wait.

579
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:06,219
Rym: So he puts his hand out, and it hits his hand and burrows into his hand, and he sees it slithering and writhing under his skin up his arm.

580
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:15,160
Rym: So he grabs some headphones and ties them around his arm, and he's holding them there desperately, the things like trying to get past this tourniquet he's made, and he's screaming and knocking everything off.

581
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:19,740
Rym: He's getting a knife and -- Yeah, so he's screaming and yelling and knocking everything over and freaking out.

582
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,867
Rym: And then his parents come into the room, and they're like, "The fuck, son?

583
00:32:23,472 --> 00:32:23,794
Rym: You want

584
00:32:23,835 --> 00:32:24,197
Rym: drugs?".

585
00:32:24,823 --> 00:32:26,057
Rym: And then he's like, "There's a thing in the

586
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:26,259
Rym: strike!".

587
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:27,379
Rym: And it's gone, of course.

588
00:32:27,624 --> 00:32:27,712
Rym: Yeah.

589
00:32:28,563 --> 00:32:29,352
Rym: And he's like, "That was

590
00:32:29,392 --> 00:32:29,675
Rym: weird.".

591
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:31,179
Rym: So fast-forward a bit.

592
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:42,279
Rym: His hand becomes like Dee's hand in Initial Dee, except it can conform -- basically, his hand can go woo-dlee-woo-dlee-woo, like the villain in Speedgrapher.

593
00:32:43,081 --> 00:32:45,240
Rym: And it can change size and shape, like Jake the dog.

594
00:32:46,161 --> 00:32:49,120
Rym: And it can turn into giant-knived dragons or whatever.

595
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:53,840
Rym: And his hand just goes all woo-dlee-woo-dlee and starts talking to him.

596
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,359
Scott: So he can't control it?

597
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:56,850
Rym: Nope.

598
00:32:56,911 --> 00:32:57,799
Rym: It 100% controls his hand.

599
00:32:58,742 --> 00:33:01,839
Scott: It's basically because he kept the parasite contained into the hand.

600
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:06,189
Rym: And the parasite's like -- it makes a mouth, and it's like, "Ugh, God damn it!

601
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,660
Rym: I was trying to get into your brain.

602
00:33:08,241 --> 00:33:09,011
Rym: Well, this

603
00:33:09,092 --> 00:33:09,476
Rym: sucks.".

604
00:33:09,841 --> 00:33:12,740
Scott: So, yeah, if it would have gotten into his head, it would have just controlled his whole body.

605
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,619
Rym: Now, they got into other people's heads.

606
00:33:15,061 --> 00:33:17,400
Rym: One of them got into a dog, and that was weird.

607
00:33:18,001 --> 00:33:25,373
Rym: And basically, him and this thing have this sort of, like, Midori-no-Hibi, like, "We have came to

608
00:33:25,433 --> 00:33:25,815
Rym: team.".

609
00:33:27,523 --> 00:33:28,999
Scott: It's a common theme in anime.

610
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:34,000
Rym: The parasite's like, "I don't really know what I am because you interrupted my life cycle.

611
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,426
Rym: So, are we cool?

612
00:33:36,988 --> 00:33:39,317
Rym: Can you just deal with me being

613
00:33:39,357 --> 00:33:39,538
Rym: here?".

614
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:43,796
Rym: And then he's like, "But the other ones of you are killing people.

615
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:44,519
Rym: I gotta stop

616
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:44,620
Rym: it.".

617
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:49,318
Rym: And the parasite's like, "Yeah, I don't really care about that, so don't make trouble for

618
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:49,439
Rym: me.".

619
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:49,981
Rym: Yeah,

620
00:33:50,001 --> 00:34:02,020
Scott: I mean, like, if I'm a bear, and all the other bears decide to go and kill all humans, but I don't care about killing all the humans, and the other bears don't care that I don't care about killing all humans, and I just, you know, eat fish from the river.

621
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:04,560
Rym: Well, no, you go and have sex with the humans instead.

622
00:34:04,882 --> 00:34:06,340
Rym: And try to get promise kisses.

623
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:09,179
Scott: Have some honey from the tree and do some Winnie the Pooh action.

624
00:34:10,203 --> 00:34:11,013
Scott: It's like, "What's the

625
00:34:11,033 --> 00:34:11,498
Scott: problem?".

626
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:16,980
Rym: In Yuri Bearstorm, when the honey comes out, that isn't even allegory at that point.

627
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:17,759
Rym: That's just honey.

628
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:18,840
Scott: So sweet.

629
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,987
Rym: It is the sweet.

630
00:34:20,047 --> 00:34:21,639
Rym: It has a delicious smell.

631
00:34:22,366 --> 00:34:23,880
Rym: Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it.

632
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:28,938
Rym: So, like, at one point, the parasite, like, basically, he's like, "I should go to the

633
00:34:28,978 --> 00:34:29,219
Rym: police.".

634
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:34,779
Rym: The parasite's like, "They would just, like, send you to a government thing and cut me off, and probably keep you in prison

635
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:34,940
Rym: forever.".

636
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,340
Scott: Why does that thing even know about human society?

637
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:41,520
Rym: Because it demands that he, like, give it books and stuff.

638
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:51,940
Rym: So, when he's asleep, it, like, when he's asleep, it, like, makes big eyes and, like, mouths, and it types on keyboards, and, like, surfs the internet all night while he's asleep, like, just learning shit about people.

639
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:52,538
Rym: Multi-pests.

640
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:59,759
Rym: And, basically, it kind of turns him into a badass because it'll kind of do stuff for him.

641
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:07,719
Rym: Like, it helps him beat a guy up because the guy's being a dick, but it also messes with him because it doesn't understand, like, what's going on.

642
00:35:08,341 --> 00:35:09,459
Rym: It's almost, you know what it's like?

643
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:16,139
Rym: The show's a cross between Birdie the Mighty, Midori no Hibby, and Dee's Hand in Initial D.

644
00:35:17,243 --> 00:35:17,794
Scott: Initial D?

645
00:35:17,855 --> 00:35:18,120
Scott: Really?

646
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,757
Rym: Initial D. Vampire Hunter D.

647
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,420
Scott: That's a hand that can drive.

648
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:24,149
Rym: The gum-taped deathmatch gets a whole lot more interesting.

649
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:27,060
Rym: He used his tongue to push it that extra distance.

650
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,288
Scott: Sure, I'll take my hand to the wheel.

651
00:35:30,308 --> 00:35:30,932
Scott: I don't give a shit.

652
00:35:30,952 --> 00:35:32,260
Scott: My hand can all go wooly wooly.

653
00:35:33,041 --> 00:35:36,598
Rym: No, I don't think you understand the degree to which his hand goes.

654
00:35:36,658 --> 00:35:37,140
Rym: wooly wooly.

655
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:42,400
Rym: It basically forms a giant, like, dragon and fights with another one of these things.

656
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,620
Scott: Doesn't the law of conservation of matter come into this?

657
00:35:44,761 --> 00:35:45,244
Rym: Not at all.

658
00:35:45,788 --> 00:35:46,432
Rym: Not at all.

659
00:35:46,492 --> 00:35:47,137
Rym: This is like...

660
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:51,114
Scott: I mean, at least Attack on Titan, like, attempts to deal with that issue.

661
00:35:51,134 --> 00:35:51,737
Scott: Poorly.

662
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:59,619
Rym: Basically, this thing is like... It's like a lot of that Japanese body horror kind of stuff is.

663
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,629
Rym: And it's just very wooly.

664
00:36:01,871 --> 00:36:03,039
Rym: Like, look, that's it right there.

665
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:03,940
Scott: What the fuck?

666
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:07,193
Rym: Yeah, it's like, "I need to use the internet.

667
00:36:07,273 --> 00:36:08,157
Rym: Let me look stuff

668
00:36:08,378 --> 00:36:08,458
Rym: up.".

669
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:09,540
Scott: Okay.

670
00:36:10,122 --> 00:36:14,997
Rym: The show is crazy and I don't know what to say about it.

671
00:36:15,097 --> 00:36:18,710
Rym: other than that Emily found it kind of disturbing but interesting.

672
00:36:19,554 --> 00:36:21,220
Rym: I find it kind of hilarious.

673
00:36:22,942 --> 00:36:24,269
Rym: So, I kind of recommend it.

674
00:36:24,993 --> 00:36:26,180
Rym: At least watch an episode or two.

675
00:36:27,303 --> 00:36:29,039
Rym: There's not a lot else out there to like it.

676
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,680
Scott: Is that pictures of live action Parasite?

677
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,860
Rym: Uh, there is a live action Parasite.

678
00:36:33,383 --> 00:36:33,814
Scott: What the fuck?

679
00:36:35,122 --> 00:36:37,380
Rym: Yeah, it does stuff like that.

680
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:41,199
Rym: Like, it doesn't want him to go somewhere so it just makes like this giant finger arm.

681
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:43,498
Scott: Just cut that shit off, yo.

682
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:47,479
Rym: Yeah, this kid does everything that you would try to do.

683
00:36:47,721 --> 00:36:48,979
Scott: Just take a cleaver and go for it.

684
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,500
Rym: Yeah, it doesn't work out so well.

685
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,039
Scott: Why not?

686
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,136
Rym: Watch your show.

687
00:36:55,642 --> 00:36:56,480
Scott: Cleaver a little farther.

688
00:36:58,943 --> 00:37:00,940
Rym: I don't know if that's from the manga or if that's Photoshopped.

689
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,139
Scott: Just cleaver a bit farther up.

690
00:37:03,143 --> 00:37:03,970
Rym: I would not cleave that.

691
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:04,817
Rym: I'd be afraid it would hurt.

692
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,220
Scott: You know, cleaver the shoulder if you have to.

693
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,520
Rym: You see what's on my screen, right?

694
00:37:10,201 --> 00:37:11,740
Scott: I'm just saying, you know, go for the shoulder.

695
00:37:12,623 --> 00:37:13,205
Scott: You need your life.

696
00:37:13,527 --> 00:37:16,439
Scott: I'd rather have my life without the arm than to deal with it.

697
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:21,300
Rym: So, this show, what's interesting is the person directing it, Kenichi Shimizu.

698
00:37:22,561 --> 00:37:27,320
Rym: He's one of those guys who was like a unit director for like individual episodes, like a million shows.

699
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:30,059
Rym: And apparently he was an animator on Goof Troop.

700
00:37:30,721 --> 00:37:30,974
Scott: Alright.

701
00:37:31,562 --> 00:37:36,200
Rym: But this is the only thing I can see that he actually directed, like fully directed.

702
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:36,978
Rym: That was a real show.

703
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:42,380
Rym: And it's pretty well done and actually kind of interesting and I actually kind of enjoy it quite a bit.

704
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,300
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

705
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:55,420
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

706
00:37:55,820 --> 00:38:00,860
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

707
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,780
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

708
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:08,520
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

709
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:12,036
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

710
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,340
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

711
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:19,460
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
