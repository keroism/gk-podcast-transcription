1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,615
Rym: It's Monday, February 23rd, 2015.

2
00:00:10,615 --> 00:00:12,880
Rym: I'm Rym, and this is GeekNights Tonight.

3
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,809
Rym: Lenovo, and how you should never buy anything from them ever again.

4
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:23,547
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:25,251 --> 00:00:35,550
Rym: So, technology, you know, we're always advocates of how technology lets you, like, keep every conversation you ever have, and you can sort of search through and resolve arguments, and, you know, the internet doesn't forget.

6
00:00:37,493 --> 00:00:42,190
Rym: Well, I'm glad that we're living by the sword and dying by the exact same sword, because it turns out...

7
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:42,789
Scott: I'm not dying.

8
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,289
Rym: Well, you're losing 20 bucks.

9
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:45,207
Scott: Big deal.

10
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:46,891
Rym: Live by the $20.

11
00:00:46,891 --> 00:00:49,084
Scott: You don't have $20?

12
00:00:49,084 --> 00:00:50,110
Scott: You got a problem with monies?

13
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:53,310
Rym: You gotta pay the poor man's bet, not the rich man's bet.

14
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:58,148
Rym: So, back in 2012, in the... When was that?

15
00:00:58,610 --> 00:00:59,857
Rym: Yeah, ancient times.

16
00:00:59,937 --> 00:01:01,385
Rym: Quetzalcoatl never showed up, too.

17
00:01:01,827 --> 00:01:02,310
Rym: Waiting for him.

18
00:01:02,912 --> 00:01:15,350
Rym: We did a show, and we were talking about OSX and Mountain Lion and Gatekeeper and all that stuff, and Scott and I kind of doubled down on a position we took, and we made a bet.

19
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:20,750
Rym: In fact, not only did we make a bet, but this is notable because Scott doesn't fucking ever make bets.

20
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:31,190
Rym: Scott was so sure, and so was I, that what I bet was, and you're gonna see why this is gonna fail now, quoting myself.

21
00:01:31,951 --> 00:01:33,696
Rym: Well, first, Scott, I will bet money.

22
00:01:33,957 --> 00:01:38,390
Rym: Within three years, you won't be able to install non-App Store software on Apple computers.

23
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:46,789
Scott: All right, well, I got the time frame wrong, but that has definitely been going in that direction, and give it some number of more years that I will not bet on.

24
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,124
Rym: No, you're not gonna bet anymore.

25
00:01:48,144 --> 00:01:48,590
Rym: You're not as sure.

26
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,277
Scott: But it is going to happen.

27
00:01:50,337 --> 00:01:50,839
Scott: It's coming.

28
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,470
Scott: It's been happening since then, and it's happening more.

29
00:01:54,111 --> 00:01:58,560
Rym: So, my bet was, and I quote, "I will bet $100.

30
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:09,568
Rym: that Scott is right with the qualifier that if Apple actually removes it, the option that lets you, like, sideload, but some hacker finds a supported way around it, I will still

31
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:09,750
Rym: win.".

32
00:02:10,632 --> 00:02:14,470
Rym: So, if someone cracked or hacked or got around it, I didn't lose the bet.

33
00:02:14,971 --> 00:02:19,750
Rym: And I bet that in 2012, and there's some follow-up discussion where people are...

34
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:25,890
Scott: Yeah, but at least today, if you buy a brand new MacBook Pro, you can install things on it, and Apple doesn't try to stop you.

35
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:33,430
Rym: So, some days ago, not very long ago, someone tweeted at me, and they tweeted at me a screenshot.

36
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:40,829
Rym: It was a screenshot of a notification on their phone reminding them that the deadline for the bet was coming up.

37
00:02:41,951 --> 00:02:48,316
Rym: And, yeah, we lost that bet, so I owe our friend George, like, $100, and Scott owes him, like, $20.

38
00:02:48,316 --> 00:02:49,549
Scott: This is why I don't bet a lot of money.

39
00:02:52,471 --> 00:03:02,989
Scott: And somewhat related to that, I've made a habit of, like, when I look things up on the internet that are from olden times, I look at, like, dates on Wikipedia of things.

40
00:03:05,355 --> 00:03:07,349
Rym: Trying to, like, match up, like, what happened when.

41
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:10,510
Scott: Right, like, maybe I'll find a video game, right?

42
00:03:11,172 --> 00:03:17,670
Scott: And I'll see, I'll, like, look up some old video game, and I'll be like, you know, what was the release date for Super Metroid?

43
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:31,390
Scott: Right, and then I'll see what it was, and then I go in my calendar, and I'll go to, like, the significant round number anniversary, like, 25th anniversary or something, and I'll put in, like, Super Metroid 20th anniversary on my Google calendar.

44
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:38,309
Scott: And then, one day, that happens, and then you can tweet it or whatever, and people are like,

45
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:38,610
Scott: "Whoa!"

46
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,699
Scott: And no one else tweeted it.

47
00:03:40,485 --> 00:03:40,929
Scott: You're just you.

48
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:45,370
Rym: So, a better way to go about that, why don't you just use, like, TweetDeck and schedule that shit?

49
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:52,850
Scott: Uh, 'cause then, you got to, you know, let's say the 50th anniversary of something, right, that TweetDeck still has to be running then.

50
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:53,989
Rym: Ah, true, true.

51
00:03:54,090 --> 00:04:05,628
Rym: It's, you know, it's easier to get a goo, you know, the goo, and you might not wanna Plus, what if, like, Hitler 3 rises on that same day, and the whole world is going crazy, and you're like, "Hey guys, the 50th anniversary of

52
00:04:05,668 --> 00:04:06,109
Rym: Mario!".

53
00:04:06,491 --> 00:04:08,469
Scott: Yeah, you know, stuff like that.

54
00:04:10,471 --> 00:04:17,790
Scott: Just find, whenever you look up something old, look at the date, and then find an anniversary and put it on your Google calendar, and it's interesting.

55
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:18,610
Scott: Yeah, it is.

56
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:23,402
Scott: When you get the notification on that day, you'll be like, "Oh shit, that's blank years old?

57
00:04:23,502 --> 00:04:24,024
Scott: Fuck me.

58
00:04:24,044 --> 00:04:24,184
Scott: Fuck

59
00:04:24,645 --> 00:04:24,705
Scott: me.".

60
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:31,270
Rym: It gets real bad with movies, especially when it's movies that I saw in the theater.

61
00:04:31,952 --> 00:04:34,689
Rym: That is a big differentiator for me being an old man.

62
00:04:35,691 --> 00:04:38,442
Rym: But yeah, we were, you know, never, never, ever.

63
00:04:38,562 --> 00:04:40,690
Rym: imply that we won't admit it when we're wrong.

64
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:45,670
Rym: We made a prediction three years ago in technology, and we were fucking completely wrong.

65
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:46,837
Scott: We were wrong on the time frame.

66
00:04:46,897 --> 00:04:48,650
Scott: I still think we'll be wrong on the fact.

67
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,418
Rym: I don't think so anymore.

68
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:52,990
Rym: I think the sideload options will remain indefinitely.

69
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:59,581
Rym: I think that either Mac OS X will disappear entirely, or continue to be more locked down over time as it has been.

70
00:05:04,793 --> 00:05:06,509
Rym: Except it's opened up in a lot of ways.

71
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:07,367
Scott: In what ways?

72
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:16,108
Rym: Quote, "Instead of Dropbox having to do kernel hack stuff to change the icons to sync folders, Apple gave them an API they could use to change

73
00:05:16,148 --> 00:05:16,289
Rym: that.".

74
00:05:16,952 --> 00:05:17,767
Scott: Oh my god.

75
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:22,666
Rym: "Apple let them use this feature in the same release that they launched CloudKit, which could be seen as a

76
00:05:22,686 --> 00:05:23,309
Rym: competitor.".

77
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:30,329
Rym: I'm quoting Luke Burge in The Forum, where he basically argues vociferously against your assertion that they're locking down more as time goes on.

78
00:05:31,214 --> 00:05:34,614
Rym: There is the secondary issue where they're- Changing icons.

79
00:05:34,755 --> 00:05:37,349
Scott: Oh man, that's just so not locking down.

80
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,598
Rym: There is the secondary.

81
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,710
Rym: There's kind of two separate things.

82
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:45,930
Rym: There's the, can you load applications that you wrote or that aren't in the app store or aren't approved or blessed?

83
00:05:46,331 --> 00:05:51,230
Rym: And then there's the, do they enforce apps that are in the app store to follow certain requirements?

84
00:05:51,612 --> 00:05:55,790
Rym: And on that side, the latter side, they're definitely going down that direction.

85
00:05:56,691 --> 00:05:57,990
Scott: Well, they've always been in that direction.

86
00:05:58,111 --> 00:06:01,350
Rym: I kind of feel like Android should go down that same direction.

87
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:07,064
Scott: Well, I don't think you should enforce restrictions on people of like.

88
00:06:07,725 --> 00:06:12,690
Scott: how they- There's certain kinds of restrictions that are okay and certain kinds that aren't, right?

89
00:06:12,813 --> 00:06:13,188
Scott: That's true.

90
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:18,830
Scott: Apple, for example, will not let you make a porn app and put it in their app store.

91
00:06:18,991 --> 00:06:19,790
Rym: No, I think that's bad.

92
00:06:20,071 --> 00:06:28,930
Scott: Even if that porn app is absolutely in every way completely legal and there's a parental control or whatever the fuck you want or, you know, et cetera, they will not allow it.

93
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:40,790
Scott: And they have often, you know, porn, you know, when you see it, Apple has often blocked, you know, and sometimes gone back on their blockage or denials.

94
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:41,569
Rym: That is true.

95
00:06:42,271 --> 00:06:43,052
Scott: But not always.

96
00:06:43,793 --> 00:06:55,569
Scott: Apps that, you know, contain sexual content or violent content or whatever that is not actually porn or it's perhaps of an artistic or other, you know, worthwhile nature.

97
00:06:57,831 --> 00:07:00,517
Scott: And, you know, those sorts of things are not cool.

98
00:07:00,938 --> 00:07:06,190
Scott: to say you can't come in my app store because there's some boobies, you know, on this album cover.

99
00:07:07,535 --> 00:07:11,990
Rym: For example, there are things that you can do in Android apps that just fuck the battery.

100
00:07:12,551 --> 00:07:12,671
Scott: Yes.

101
00:07:12,712 --> 00:07:15,450
Scott: And I feel they are checking for the general.

102
00:07:16,051 --> 00:07:23,845
Scott: One thing I do agree is that if you're going to put something in an app store that's, you know, verified that somebody should, you know, like.

103
00:07:24,105 --> 00:07:26,650
Scott: I'm trusting that because it's the official app store.

104
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,010
Scott: Right.

105
00:07:28,731 --> 00:07:34,670
Scott: And it's like you sort of as a person don't have the mental capacity to trust and distrust individual things.

106
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:36,876
Scott: If I trust the app store, I have to trust everything in it.

107
00:07:36,997 --> 00:07:41,570
Scott: I can't like I know I do not trust download dot com or anything on it.

108
00:07:42,031 --> 00:07:50,010
Scott: I can't like, you know, if I have to then suddenly trust some things on download dot com and some and not others, that's a huge pain in the ass.

109
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:50,629
Rym: Exactly.

110
00:07:50,951 --> 00:07:59,730
Scott: So if I'm going to trust the official Google Play store of apps or the official iOS store of apps, I need to know that none of those apps have malwares.

111
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:05,230
Scott: None of them will like actively harm my device or ruin the performance.

112
00:08:06,171 --> 00:08:11,929
Scott: It's a list of quality issues that need to be addressed by who is ever approving what goes in there.

113
00:08:12,711 --> 00:08:13,174
Rym: Exactly.

114
00:08:13,194 --> 00:08:15,510
Rym: And I'm really OK with those kinds of restrictions.

115
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:15,811
Rym: Yeah.

116
00:08:15,951 --> 00:08:16,152
Scott: Yeah.

117
00:08:16,192 --> 00:08:17,194
Scott: Some of them are OK.

118
00:08:17,254 --> 00:08:23,650
Scott: And so, you know, but if I want to install the make my phone explode app, I should be able to go and download it.

119
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,095
Rym: What was that app that I found?

120
00:08:25,135 --> 00:08:29,010
Rym: I think I used it a long time ago, but use the accelerometer and the GPS.

121
00:08:29,431 --> 00:08:34,049
Rym: And the goal was throw your phone as hard as you can up and then catch it.

122
00:08:34,371 --> 00:08:36,285
Rym: And your high score is how high it got.

123
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:36,770
Scott: Yep.

124
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:38,631
Scott: Great.

125
00:08:39,011 --> 00:08:49,130
Rym: But I don't think Apple is going to restrict or prevent people from unchecking that box that says, yeah, install some bullshit if I want.

126
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,990
Rym: I think that's going to still be an option for the foreseeable future.

127
00:08:52,611 --> 00:08:53,153
Scott: Eventually.

128
00:08:53,595 --> 00:08:54,761
Rym: I don't think eventually ever.

129
00:08:54,781 --> 00:08:55,927
Scott: I think eventually.

130
00:08:56,007 --> 00:08:56,550
Rym: I don't think so.

131
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,302
Rym: I think at least in the Y plus 30.

132
00:08:59,302 --> 00:09:00,748
Rym: So, you know, 30 years ish.

133
00:09:02,111 --> 00:09:03,475
Scott: You're really stretching the time frame.

134
00:09:03,636 --> 00:09:08,130
Rym: Yeah, I was 100 percent wrong and I fully accept that.

135
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,777
Scott: I only got the time frame wrong.

136
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:10,621
Scott: I believe.

137
00:09:10,923 --> 00:09:11,164
Rym: Yeah.

138
00:09:11,224 --> 00:09:11,526
Rym: All right.

139
00:09:11,586 --> 00:09:11,847
Rym: All right.

140
00:09:13,771 --> 00:09:14,997
Scott: I only got the time frame wrong.

141
00:09:15,057 --> 00:09:18,070
Scott: I still believe, believe the end is nigh.

142
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:18,912
Scott: I can't say when.

143
00:09:19,594 --> 00:09:25,230
Rym: So in other news, you know that Google acquired Waze and they kind of integrated that stuff.

144
00:09:26,171 --> 00:09:26,974
Scott: What did they acquire?

145
00:09:26,994 --> 00:09:29,564
Rym: Waze, Waze, Waze, Waze, Waze.

146
00:09:31,752 --> 00:09:33,260
Rym: You don't know about Waze?

147
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,070
Scott: I don't know what the hell you're talking about.

148
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:38,019
Rym: So Waze was an app that basically.

149
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:38,963
Scott: How do you spell this?

150
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:40,228
Rym: W A Z E.

151
00:09:40,931 --> 00:09:41,292
Scott: OK.

152
00:09:41,312 --> 00:09:48,997
Scott: That's oh, are they trying to be cute like W A Y S. But they spelled it W A Z E but pronounce it the same.

153
00:09:49,017 --> 00:09:54,650
Rym: I guess it just pronounced ways like I never thought about it because basically it was an app you could use.

154
00:09:55,031 --> 00:09:59,250
Scott: And it would tell you about traffic and Google Maps tells you about traffic and navigation.

155
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:00,797
Rym: So Google Maps used to do it kind of shittily.

156
00:10:00,837 --> 00:10:01,762
Rym: Google bought them.

157
00:10:01,782 --> 00:10:03,250
Scott: Google Maps does it really well.

158
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:07,390
Scott: They've done it really well since Google Maps stopped sucking, which is like in its second year.

159
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:14,850
Rym: See, now you say that, but actually Google Maps directions like live navigation was really bad at routing you around accidents and traffic.

160
00:10:15,312 --> 00:10:18,024
Scott: I know for about two years, Google Maps is garbage.

161
00:10:18,165 --> 00:10:19,210
Scott: And then it became good.

162
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:21,121
Rym: You're talking about like 2003, like that kind of era.

163
00:10:21,141 --> 00:10:21,221
Rym: Yeah.

164
00:10:22,811 --> 00:10:24,057
Scott: I remember when it was brand new.

165
00:10:24,077 --> 00:10:26,530
Scott: You would we were like, fuck Google Maps.

166
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:27,635
Scott: I mean, it looks better.

167
00:10:27,695 --> 00:10:29,947
Scott: But MapQuest actually tells you where the fuck to go.

168
00:10:30,027 --> 00:10:30,510
Scott: That was true.

169
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,701
Scott: It doesn't send you down a one way street to die.

170
00:10:33,223 --> 00:10:34,027
Rym: That was in fact true.

171
00:10:34,088 --> 00:10:34,510
Rym: I didn't try.

172
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:35,796
Rym: Google Maps was the worst.

173
00:10:35,856 --> 00:10:36,057
Scott: Right.

174
00:10:36,097 --> 00:10:38,510
Scott: In about two years, they stopped sucking and beat MapQuest.

175
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:40,075
Scott: And then people were like, what's MapQuest?

176
00:10:40,115 --> 00:10:44,390
Scott: And ever since then, Google Maps has been pretty much perfect compared to other competitors.

177
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,275
Scott: There's been no reason to use anything else.

178
00:10:46,295 --> 00:10:46,516
Rym: Yeah.

179
00:10:46,536 --> 00:10:46,717
Rym: Yeah.

180
00:10:46,777 --> 00:10:50,890
Rym: Except I drive a lot, you know, just like taking people places and kind of like the chauffeur at this point.

181
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:55,170
Rym: And even though neither one of us owns a car, I just have the Zipcar.

182
00:10:56,591 --> 00:11:01,450
Rym: But Waze had way better like speed trap, alternate route.

183
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:02,292
Scott: Oh, my God.

184
00:11:02,312 --> 00:11:05,990
Scott: Trap info is somewhat illegal in some places.

185
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:09,221
Rym: Those court cases pretty much always get overturned.

186
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:09,844
Scott: That's good.

187
00:11:09,924 --> 00:11:10,246
Scott: Yeah.

188
00:11:10,306 --> 00:11:11,270
Scott: We won some free speech.

189
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:12,576
Rym: We usually win those in the end.

190
00:11:12,696 --> 00:11:13,118
Scott: Good job.

191
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,390
Rym: But basically, Waze had much better data.

192
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:22,800
Rym: And what Waze would do that Google Maps didn't do for a long time was say you're driving and there's an accident like right now, it would.

193
00:11:23,242 --> 00:11:27,440
Rym: it would very likely be able to tell you, yo dog, get off the freeway the next exit or you're fucked.

194
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,310
Rym: Like right then, like real time.

195
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:31,434
Rym: Yeah.

196
00:11:31,454 --> 00:11:35,270
Scott: So Google Maps, even today, it doesn't reroute.

197
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:45,010
Scott: It's like you when you ask for the directions, it gets you a route and you choose that route and then it locks that route in and won't reroute.

198
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:48,630
Scott: Now, you say that unless you go off the route, then it will reroute.

199
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:50,034
Rym: This is what changed.

200
00:11:50,095 --> 00:11:54,774
Rym: I don't know if it works on iPhone, but at least on Android, if you're driving now what it does.

201
00:11:54,794 --> 00:11:56,481
Scott: I've never actually used the driving.

202
00:11:56,742 --> 00:11:56,983
Rym: Yeah.

203
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:58,690
Scott: So I use the walking in the bike.

204
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:58,950
Rym: Yeah.

205
00:11:58,971 --> 00:11:59,936
Rym: I've used the navigator one.

206
00:11:59,976 --> 00:12:02,209
Rym: Well, it does this for walking and everything, too.

207
00:12:02,691 --> 00:12:09,861
Rym: It'll always constantly be showing you just like on the map, gray offshoots like this is a juncture where you could take this all day.

208
00:12:09,881 --> 00:12:13,094
Scott: You can see the routes there because they're the same ones that were there when you asked.

209
00:12:13,114 --> 00:12:13,496
Rym: But it does.

210
00:12:13,556 --> 00:12:23,194
Rym: it live while you're navigating and it flags any route that is currently based on current right now data faster than the road you're on right now.

211
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:31,328
Rym: So if an accident happens on like the freeway ahead of you, but it doesn't automatically switch you to that route, it just puts a little it pops up and says, yo, you want to you want to try this other route.

212
00:12:31,568 --> 00:12:31,850
Scott: All right.

213
00:12:32,611 --> 00:12:35,543
Scott: I've never seen that happen even one because it's only started happening.

214
00:12:35,624 --> 00:12:39,057
Scott: And I guess it would only be likely to happen driving because that's where traffic is.

215
00:12:39,098 --> 00:12:39,419
Scott: Yes.

216
00:12:40,122 --> 00:12:46,506
Rym: And it only started happening after they bought ways and ways was just really good at figuring out ways, ways.

217
00:12:47,891 --> 00:12:48,313
Scott: Yeah.

218
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,943
Scott: That's why I called that the Beatles.

219
00:12:51,466 --> 00:12:54,519
Scott: So Google bought ways and used it to make Google Maps better.

220
00:12:54,619 --> 00:12:56,990
Rym: So they finally integrated all that shit into Google Maps.

221
00:12:57,131 --> 00:12:58,014
Rym: And here's the problem.

222
00:12:58,034 --> 00:12:58,798
Rym: It's not a problem.

223
00:12:58,838 --> 00:13:00,143
Rym: It's a problem for people who suck.

224
00:13:00,686 --> 00:13:03,036
Rym: Tons of people, particularly in

225
00:13:03,196 --> 00:13:03,497
Rym: L.A.,

226
00:13:03,517 --> 00:13:14,339
Rym: are suing or otherwise super pissed because now there's a ton of traffic in their neighborhoods because Google Maps is telling people smart ways to get around traffic jams.

227
00:13:15,424 --> 00:13:20,524
Rym: So suddenly, like before, we're like I-84, which would be blocked because there's an accident on the bridge.

228
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:25,784
Rym: Now, ways will tell everyone all the different ways to go.

229
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:35,062
Rym: And as the ways around that start getting saturated, it finds other ways because it's using live data from all the other people driving.

230
00:13:35,082 --> 00:13:43,214
Rym: So people are super mad that roads that were once quiet, it turns out if you analyze the data, are the best way to get places.

231
00:13:43,535 --> 00:13:49,399
Rym: And people are making maximum efficient use of the existing roads, making traffic flow faster and pissing off NIMBYs.

232
00:13:49,419 --> 00:13:51,768
Scott: Well, listen, you have two choices.

233
00:13:51,848 --> 00:13:55,466
Scott: Number one, you can shut up or number two, we can knock your house down and put a train there.

234
00:13:55,526 --> 00:13:56,310
Scott: Those are your choices.

235
00:13:57,372 --> 00:13:58,556
Scott: No other choice is allowed.

236
00:13:58,576 --> 00:14:03,073
Rym: So, yeah, basically these complaints are ridiculous.

237
00:14:03,996 --> 00:14:09,699
Rym: You can never fault people for using available information and technology to make systems more efficient.

238
00:14:09,739 --> 00:14:16,910
Scott: I can find one fault, which is if and this is only if I don't know this has happened.

239
00:14:17,613 --> 00:14:22,712
Scott: If it routed someone down a private road, that person with the private road can complain.

240
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:23,435
Rym: Yes.

241
00:14:23,797 --> 00:14:27,653
Scott: But if you own a private road, fuck you rich asshole.

242
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:32,532
Scott: You can get a helicopter to work and you can get some earplugs because you're still goddamn rich of a private road.

243
00:14:32,552 --> 00:14:33,797
Scott: So go fuck yourself.

244
00:14:33,857 --> 00:14:39,861
Scott: If you complained about someone driving in a private road to avoid traffic, I don't see any problem drowning you.

245
00:14:40,283 --> 00:14:41,026
Rym: But it's amazing.

246
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:45,162
Rym: Like people, these people who are mad about getting hit by the car is a quote from the article.

247
00:14:45,644 --> 00:14:57,310
Rym: When the people whose houses hug the narrow warren of streets paralleling the busiest urban freeway in America began to see bumper to bumper traffic crawling by their homes a year or so ago, they were baffled.

248
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:03,737
Rym: Like no one had ever figured out there were shortcuts until now or a few people did.

249
00:15:03,837 --> 00:15:06,450
Rym: Suddenly those shortcuts are part of the road system.

250
00:15:07,631 --> 00:15:09,659
Rym: So the technology behind this is amazing.

251
00:15:09,719 --> 00:15:13,956
Scott: And it's I think you also could have made your roads not suck, but it's too late for that.

252
00:15:14,117 --> 00:15:14,578
Scott: So trains.

253
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:15,081
Rym: Yep.

254
00:15:15,161 --> 00:15:15,763
Rym: Live in New York.

255
00:15:15,804 --> 00:15:17,350
Rym: It's really the only place with trains.

256
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,534
Scott: Don't live in L.A.

257
00:15:18,655 --> 00:15:18,876
Scott: Yeah.

258
00:15:19,579 --> 00:15:20,764
Scott: Why the fuck do you live there?

259
00:15:20,844 --> 00:15:28,092
Rym: There's a big reason why a lot of people ask me, you know, hey, would you consider moving out to somewhere in California to have a job?

260
00:15:28,112 --> 00:15:30,081
Rym: I was like, would I need to own a car?

261
00:15:30,101 --> 00:15:32,069
Scott: Is it?

262
00:15:32,611 --> 00:15:33,976
Rym: is it not?

263
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:40,018
Scott: New York is the place you were asking me to live in the Empire State?

264
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:40,981
Rym: What did I tell?

265
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:47,486
Rym: I told one guy recently if I was willing to live, leave New York, I would have tried to work for Valve like a decade ago.

266
00:15:47,526 --> 00:15:55,016
Scott: Listen, if I was willing to leave New York, I saw the original job posting from Justin TV looking for the person to start Twitch.

267
00:15:55,417 --> 00:16:01,039
Scott: And it basically if you find that job posting and read it at the time, it was basically skills of Scott.

268
00:16:01,602 --> 00:16:02,284
Rym: That is true.

269
00:16:02,365 --> 00:16:05,497
Rym: I remember that because Scott said I could have applied to that job.

270
00:16:05,518 --> 00:16:09,333
Rym: I could really find the chat we had because you messaged me and you were like, check this out.

271
00:16:09,453 --> 00:16:17,807
Scott: I could have applied to that job and had a very good chance of getting that job if I was willing to go to California, which I wasn't then and I'm not now.

272
00:16:18,169 --> 00:16:19,996
Rym: I'm even less willing to do it now.

273
00:16:20,819 --> 00:16:26,140
Scott: So I think that's the last job posting I saw that I said, that is a job that I want.

274
00:16:27,324 --> 00:16:29,372
Scott: I have not seen such a job posting since then.

275
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:33,107
Rym: So anyway, you got any news being Monday after a long hiatus?

276
00:16:33,127 --> 00:16:41,642
Scott: Well, since there was such a hiatus, he missed a very important news where the commissioner of the FCC was actually influenced by our deluge of comments.

277
00:16:42,285 --> 00:16:53,509
Scott: And it despite not actually revealing his full proposal, the summary of it is pretty much he's going in our favor and they're going to vote on it real soon.

278
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:56,702
Rym: This is getting real complicated because net neutrality February 26.

279
00:16:56,702 --> 00:16:57,103
Scott: So three days.

280
00:16:57,284 --> 00:17:07,446
Rym: It's like the Democrats have this really wide and derpy range of opinions on this issue when really they don't have any opinions because I don't think any of them really understand it.

281
00:17:07,608 --> 00:17:14,935
Rym: Maybe Kristen Gillibrand has like almost an idea of what this issue is, but no one else understands what it is or why anyone cares about it.

282
00:17:15,136 --> 00:17:16,201
Scott: Well, what's his name?

283
00:17:16,261 --> 00:17:18,569
Scott: Wu, who ran for lieutenant governor.

284
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:21,683
Scott: Oh, yeah, there's two who's to invented the term net neutrality.

285
00:17:21,762 --> 00:17:27,385
Rym: Yeah, there are two or three people almost at the national stage who know about this stuff.

286
00:17:27,948 --> 00:17:33,228
Rym: But the Republican Party seems to have pretty much come down hard against net neutrality, right?

287
00:17:33,248 --> 00:17:35,918
Scott: Because it's against the people who are paying them money.

288
00:17:35,998 --> 00:17:36,761
Scott: Exactly.

289
00:17:36,781 --> 00:17:41,761
Scott: Anyway, so as I said, I said commissioner, he is the chairman, right?

290
00:17:41,802 --> 00:17:43,790
Scott: The other people in the FCC are the commissioners.

291
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,681
Scott: So it's like a chairman with like a little council of commissioners, right?

292
00:17:46,822 --> 00:17:47,042
Rym: Yep.

293
00:17:47,384 --> 00:17:53,810
Scott: So he is basically the one time in the past, my lifetime, the government has worked.

294
00:17:55,191 --> 00:17:55,674
Rym: Maybe.

295
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:56,236
Scott: Maybe.

296
00:17:56,256 --> 00:17:58,325
Scott: Well, government has appeared to almost work.

297
00:17:58,446 --> 00:18:02,061
Rym: Congress has already realized the government is going to shut down again over that immigration thing.

298
00:18:02,101 --> 00:18:02,905
Rym: Like we're already.

299
00:18:03,085 --> 00:18:03,407
Scott: Maybe.

300
00:18:03,788 --> 00:18:08,890
Scott: But it appears that that government has almost democracy may work soon.

301
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:13,849
Scott: The signs are it's like that clock that never rings.

302
00:18:15,233 --> 00:18:17,362
Scott: The hammer next to the bell is pulled back.

303
00:18:18,226 --> 00:18:18,909
Scott: It hasn't rung.

304
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:21,018
Scott: We got three days quote.

305
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:21,399
Rym: today.

306
00:18:21,439 --> 00:18:28,568
Rym: Wheeler has released a four page fact sheet about his proposal, which would reclassify broadband Internet under stricter and more utility like laws.

307
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:29,311
Scott: Right.

308
00:18:29,372 --> 00:18:35,977
Scott: So the actual plan is three hundred and thirty two pages, but only eight of those pages contain the rules.

309
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:42,504
Scott: The rest of it is just legal justifications and other bullshit that you don't need to actually read unless you're some lawyer or whatnot.

310
00:18:42,584 --> 00:18:45,902
Scott: But someone's job was to write that fucking thing.

311
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:47,089
Scott: God bless them.

312
00:18:49,772 --> 00:19:00,877
Scott: So anyway, the Republican commissioners right who are pretty much going to lose this vote if it goes down in three days are basically like, let's delay.

313
00:19:01,118 --> 00:19:01,962
Scott: Let's delay.

314
00:19:02,022 --> 00:19:03,287
Scott: We got we got to delay.

315
00:19:03,327 --> 00:19:03,709
Scott: You haven't.

316
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:08,127
Scott: Why haven't you released the full three hundred and thirty two page thing publicly?

317
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,854
Scott: And why haven't let people comment on that?

318
00:19:09,934 --> 00:19:17,725
Rym: Now, part of the reason is because the Republicans are trying to delay it so that they can try to get Congress to pass a bunch of rules before the FCC can do it.

319
00:19:17,745 --> 00:19:17,865
Rym: Yeah.

320
00:19:17,885 --> 00:19:23,750
Rym: They're trying to get in and supersede and thus supersede anything the FCC wants to do itself.

321
00:19:24,912 --> 00:19:35,878
Scott: See, even if they do that, it may bite them in the ass if they act too quickly and write up some bill that is not, you know, carefully written.

322
00:19:35,898 --> 00:19:43,210
Scott: Because if you take powers away from the FCC, many other things that they do may get messed up in a way that they don't like.

323
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:48,250
Rym: You know, it's interesting because parts of what the FCC does, I'm really against and parts of what it does.

324
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,033
Rym: I'm really for.

325
00:19:49,374 --> 00:19:55,258
Rym: So making it more or less powerful kind of equally serves some of my interest in different ways.

326
00:19:55,398 --> 00:20:03,149
Scott: Anyway, the chairman Wheeler said we received more than four million comments in the past year.

327
00:20:03,811 --> 00:20:05,157
Scott: It's time to do something.

328
00:20:05,177 --> 00:20:08,110
Scott: That was in a tweet he wrote today.

329
00:20:08,692 --> 00:20:13,370
Scott: But he's pretty much like, yeah, you want to stop and have more comments.

330
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:14,815
Scott: We had four million comments.

331
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:20,177
Scott: We're just going to vote and you're going to vote the way I want, which is yes.

332
00:20:21,021 --> 00:20:22,166
Scott: And that would be good.

333
00:20:22,186 --> 00:20:26,604
Rym: We'll see though, because like I said, it's pretty much just a partisan issue with this right now.

334
00:20:26,724 --> 00:20:38,110
Scott: Could there be, you know, it is true though that while the summary of the rules changes is pretty much 100 percent what we want almost, I mean, 90 percent what we want.

335
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,133
Scott: Can't really complain.

336
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:39,796
Scott: Right.

337
00:20:40,881 --> 00:20:51,810
Scott: Uh, he hasn't released those eight pages of actual legal wording rules changes or the other 320 whatever pages of legal nonsense.

338
00:20:52,911 --> 00:20:55,300
Scott: Maybe they're lying to us and actually they're going to vote.

339
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:55,601
Scott: Yes.

340
00:20:55,662 --> 00:20:56,505
Scott: And we're going to go, yay.

341
00:20:56,605 --> 00:20:59,599
Scott: And then we're going to see the actual rules and go, you lied to us.

342
00:20:59,639 --> 00:21:00,162
Scott: Fuck you.

343
00:21:00,202 --> 00:21:01,649
Scott: Government is just what we thought it was.

344
00:21:02,994 --> 00:21:07,870
Rym: That anti gerrymandering bill in New York that was actually just entrenching gerrymandering forever.

345
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:08,471
Scott: Yes.

346
00:21:08,552 --> 00:21:08,974
Scott: That one.

347
00:21:09,014 --> 00:21:09,255
Scott: Yup.

348
00:21:09,938 --> 00:21:10,962
Rym: That a lot of people voted for.

349
00:21:10,982 --> 00:21:18,212
Scott: But at least there is more hope now that government will work correctly on one issue than ever before.

350
00:21:18,312 --> 00:21:20,099
Scott: Not since FDR.

351
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:35,239
Rym: You know, it's interesting because it's an issue where despite the money that gets donated, the Republicans in particular who are nominally against net neutrality, they could let this one slide because their base cares much more about racist stuff than it does about network stuff.

352
00:21:36,123 --> 00:21:38,954
Scott: Ah, but the people who give them money, they could lose that money.

353
00:21:38,974 --> 00:21:41,406
Rym: But at the same time, if they have to give up something.

354
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:42,290
Scott: But here's the thing I understand.

355
00:21:43,111 --> 00:21:47,910
Scott: It's like, OK, so I'm an evil congressperson and Comcast gives me money every year to run.

356
00:21:48,231 --> 00:21:48,472
Scott: Right.

357
00:21:48,673 --> 00:21:48,894
Rym: Yup.

358
00:21:48,934 --> 00:21:50,319
Rym: And I need that money or I won't get real.

359
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,255
Scott: OK, so, uh, you know, I fight for Comcast.

360
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:54,616
Scott: Right.

361
00:21:54,737 --> 00:21:58,732
Scott: And I vote in their favor and I, you know, try to write laws for them that don't get passed.

362
00:21:59,074 --> 00:22:00,359
Scott: And every year they give me more money.

363
00:22:00,379 --> 00:22:03,932
Scott: And then this happens and net neutrality happens.

364
00:22:04,033 --> 00:22:05,519
Scott: You know, I couldn't stop it from happening.

365
00:22:05,579 --> 00:22:07,386
Scott: Oh, well, they keep giving me money.

366
00:22:07,406 --> 00:22:09,556
Scott: I don't actually have to get any fucking results for them.

367
00:22:09,717 --> 00:22:09,898
Scott: Yeah.

368
00:22:10,099 --> 00:22:11,727
Scott: It's not like they're going to stop giving me money.

369
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:12,230
Scott: They might.

370
00:22:13,631 --> 00:22:17,425
Scott: If I vote and what if I vote for you, yes, net neutrality, I like it.

371
00:22:17,665 --> 00:22:18,950
Scott: You think you're going to stop giving me money?

372
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:19,752
Rym: Probably.

373
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:20,676
Scott: I don't know.

374
00:22:21,098 --> 00:22:21,902
Scott: I don't think so.

375
00:22:22,043 --> 00:22:23,590
Scott: They just keep giving money to people.

376
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:24,152
Scott: They don't stop.

377
00:22:24,172 --> 00:22:25,839
Scott: They got to give money to somebody.

378
00:22:25,859 --> 00:22:28,992
Scott: Interesting because the other congressman is going to say, no, I don't want to.

379
00:22:29,233 --> 00:22:41,040
Rym: But the ultra psycho conservatives on the Republican side, they are kind of safe because even if they lose a lot of their money streams, it's hard to displace them unless you come in further right than them.

380
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,229
Rym: There's not a lot of room over there.

381
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,987
Rym: Anyway, things of the day.

382
00:22:51,388 --> 00:22:57,133
Rym: I'm a big fan of like old futurism, like the visions of the future from the past.

383
00:22:57,736 --> 00:23:11,330
Rym: So this is a extensive, a huge collection of advertisements that from the Bone Aluminum and Brass Corporation from Detroit, from the forties, the nineteen forties.

384
00:23:11,972 --> 00:23:17,900
Rym: And the art is basically all like super high concept design of the future.

385
00:23:20,645 --> 00:23:24,903
Rym: I don't know enough about art to classify this more than just calling it futurism.

386
00:23:24,923 --> 00:23:28,859
Rym: I don't really know, but I really like it.

387
00:23:29,161 --> 00:23:35,346
Rym: And it reminds me a lot of that Italian futurism thing that we saw, except much more Akira-esque in some fashions.

388
00:23:36,009 --> 00:23:39,362
Scott: And apparently being aerodynamic means having motorcycles makes you Akira-esque.

389
00:23:39,663 --> 00:23:42,153
Rym: Well, that motorcycle is pretty Akira-esque, that one in particular.

390
00:23:42,294 --> 00:23:43,920
Scott: Any weird motorcycle is Akira-esque.

391
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:44,883
Rym: To a degree, yes.

392
00:23:44,903 --> 00:23:48,420
Scott: You realize you could say that Akira is Bon-esque.

393
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:54,382
Scott: Considering that it came much, much later.

394
00:23:54,402 --> 00:23:56,510
Rym: As long as Akira does not give you a Bon Air.

395
00:23:56,530 --> 00:24:04,742
Scott: I don't think there's anything in that movie or manga that should give any normal, not perverted person a Bon Air.

396
00:24:04,983 --> 00:24:07,232
Rym: I was about, yeah, you qualify that pretty harshly, right?

397
00:24:07,353 --> 00:24:14,641
Scott: I mean, there's someone who's going to get a Bon Air looking at like, I don't know, like a rock, right?

398
00:24:14,702 --> 00:24:16,309
Scott: So Rock King.

399
00:24:16,691 --> 00:24:17,435
Scott: That's for sure.

400
00:24:17,777 --> 00:24:18,299
Rym: Geodude.

401
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,687
Scott: You know, he's got those.

402
00:24:21,491 --> 00:24:21,953
Scott: What's?

403
00:24:22,134 --> 00:24:27,720
Scott: I have the toy where the um, it's uh, what's it called?

404
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,930
Scott: It's the toy where he turns into a rock, but he's actually a dude.

405
00:24:30,951 --> 00:24:32,477
Rym: No, that's just regular porn.

406
00:24:32,497 --> 00:24:37,380
Scott: No, there's a toy, Rock Master or something where he's, it's uh, maybe.

407
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,056
Scott: No, I have the, um, I have the stupid toy.

408
00:24:41,076 --> 00:24:41,317
Scott: The what?

409
00:24:41,337 --> 00:24:41,660
Scott: The what?

410
00:24:43,283 --> 00:24:44,026
Scott: I have the toy.

411
00:24:44,046 --> 00:24:44,990
Scott: Rock Master, this guy?

412
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,356
Scott: No, I forget the name of it.

413
00:24:46,396 --> 00:24:47,280
Scott: It was something bots.

414
00:24:47,862 --> 00:24:48,224
Scott: Okay.

415
00:24:48,264 --> 00:24:48,605
Scott: What was it?

416
00:24:48,645 --> 00:24:50,614
Scott: What was the not transformers crappy bots?

417
00:24:50,975 --> 00:24:51,979
Rym: Well, there were several.

418
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,795
Scott: Yeah, the one that actually had the word bots in it or something.

419
00:24:58,561 --> 00:24:59,224
Rym: Anyway.

420
00:24:59,606 --> 00:24:59,988
Scott: Yeah.

421
00:25:00,591 --> 00:25:02,079
Rym: So that is my thing of the day.

422
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,185
Rym: Coolest thing I saw.

423
00:25:04,285 --> 00:25:06,797
Scott: Here's a video in my thing of the day, right?

424
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:12,080
Scott: And this thing of the day actually much like GeekNights happens to be creative commons licensed.

425
00:25:12,321 --> 00:25:17,800
Scott: They're using a attribution, no commercial share alike license.

426
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,569
Scott: So the most restrictive possible one.

427
00:25:20,533 --> 00:25:21,880
Scott: But maybe, uh, I don't know.

428
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,066
Scott: I just decided just now.

429
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:25,900
Scott: maybe I'll try to find creative commons things of the day for a while.

430
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,549
Scott: But anyway, make, make it a theme.

431
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:33,169
Scott: This creative commons thing of the day, uh, is last episode.

432
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:33,534
Scott: No, it's not.

433
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:37,599
Scott: Which is very old.

434
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:43,358
Scott: This is a video on Vimeo, uh, called dot, dot, dot.

435
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:49,882
Scott: Meanwhile, dot, dot, dot from Sandro Bocci who did the images and editing.

436
00:25:50,143 --> 00:25:52,854
Scott: The music is from Maurizio Morgan.

437
00:25:52,894 --> 00:25:54,340
Scott: I think it's Italian, perhaps.

438
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,919
Scott: Special thanks to Mario Faggioli and some other people.

439
00:25:58,841 --> 00:25:59,948
Scott: Julia set collection.

440
00:25:59,988 --> 00:26:00,290
Scott: That's it.

441
00:26:00,512 --> 00:26:00,733
Scott: All right.

442
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:01,337
Scott: All right.

443
00:26:01,397 --> 00:26:01,719
Rym: All right.

444
00:26:02,281 --> 00:26:13,208
Scott: So, uh, it's featuring, uh, proto Riester, linky, scolimia, fungi, trachea, philia, et cetera.

445
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:16,280
Scott: Many strange sea creatures.

446
00:26:16,521 --> 00:26:17,304
Scott: That's what those are.

447
00:26:18,851 --> 00:26:21,100
Scott: And in this video they find the sea creatures.

448
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:24,759
Scott: I can't tell if it's in an aquarium or the bottom of the sea.

449
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:32,052
Scott: And they did, these are really, these are sea creatures that look really weird, but move really slow.

450
00:26:32,073 --> 00:26:35,459
Scott: They're not, you know, they're the kind of thing that sits still and doesn't do a lot.

451
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,420
Rym: So specifically weird and slow is the niche, right?

452
00:26:39,101 --> 00:26:42,619
Scott: And they did a time-lapse video, so it looks like it's moving at normal speed.

453
00:26:43,741 --> 00:26:45,609
Scott: Uh, and they also did a high magnification.

454
00:26:46,492 --> 00:26:56,093
Scott: So now you can see, for example, a coral or a starfish moving pretty fast and that's not something you can usually see.

455
00:26:56,113 --> 00:27:02,580
Scott: Uh, I think they also, uh, I don't know if these colors are natural.

456
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,560
Scott: They could be because sea creatures, the music is not natural.

457
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:10,260
Rym: The music was, how do you know they're not making that music underwater?

458
00:27:10,622 --> 00:27:11,586
Rym: They just, they speed up.

459
00:27:11,827 --> 00:27:13,174
Rym: It's like that mouth silence.

460
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:14,500
Scott: Did you notice just off camera?

461
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,464
Scott: Sebastian is there.

462
00:27:15,725 --> 00:27:26,719
Rym: Did you notice in mouth silence, the Neil says, or everything, if you play it at a very high speed, it's got songs from the nineties back, like masked on top of it.

463
00:27:27,662 --> 00:27:28,145
Scott: Is that true?

464
00:27:28,265 --> 00:27:28,607
Scott: Yes.

465
00:27:29,533 --> 00:27:30,800
Scott: Can you, do you have that?

466
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,660
Rym: Not, not, not immediately at my fingertips.

467
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,960
Scott: Can you like drag the MP3 into audition and play it at high speed?

468
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,416
Rym: Yes, I can do that and I will edit it into the show.

469
00:27:38,436 --> 00:27:38,678
Rym: Okay.

470
00:27:51,561 --> 00:28:00,359
Rym: In the meta moment, we're going to be, not this weekend, but next weekend at the Penny Arcade Expo, right after the last Penny Arcade Expo.

471
00:28:00,581 --> 00:28:02,533
Scott: Weren't we just at a Penny Arcade Expo?

472
00:28:02,875 --> 00:28:09,111
Rym: Oh my God, there's, there's five packs a year if you count dev and we go to, well, at least one of us goes to all of them.

473
00:28:09,614 --> 00:28:10,720
Scott: We've been to all of them.

474
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,012
Scott: We collectively have been to every pack since 2008.

475
00:28:13,012 --> 00:28:13,414
Scott: Yeah.

476
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,020
Scott: Which means we missed four packs, four, five, six, and seven.

477
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,894
Rym: And it's been a lot of God damn packs.

478
00:28:19,975 --> 00:28:23,380
Scott: If you count it, we've also missed necroomicon and I think we missed some devs.

479
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,190
Scott: If you're counting those two, I skipped a dev.

480
00:28:25,211 --> 00:28:25,452
Rym: Yeah.

481
00:28:25,955 --> 00:28:30,860
Rym: So, uh, So on Friday, March 6th at 4 30 PM in the bumblebee theater.

482
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,797
Scott: Thanks for the great time slot and great theater.

483
00:28:32,817 --> 00:28:32,979
Scott: Yeah.

484
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:36,115
Rym: We're going to be presenting what is losing?

485
00:28:36,296 --> 00:28:37,080
Scott: What is losing?

486
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,300
Scott: It is the thing that Rym does and the panel.

487
00:28:41,042 --> 00:28:41,927
Rym: You just dropped the mic.

488
00:28:41,967 --> 00:28:43,556
Rym: I stand on stage crying for 55 minutes.

489
00:28:44,442 --> 00:28:46,218
Rym: And then I suddenly go to Q and a yup.

490
00:28:49,026 --> 00:28:51,200
Rym: Oh, the book club book is still water ship down.

491
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,480
Rym: Maybe you should update the website because Scott doesn't care about rabbits.

492
00:28:54,801 --> 00:28:57,710
Scott: I read some of that book yesterday.

493
00:28:57,730 --> 00:28:58,713
Rym: I need the affiliate link.

494
00:29:01,722 --> 00:29:03,653
Rym: Oh, I can't generate those myself.

495
00:29:03,673 --> 00:29:04,759
Scott: I could just, you could just ask me.

496
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:05,662
Rym: I did.

497
00:29:05,683 --> 00:29:07,973
Rym: I asked you many times.

498
00:29:07,993 --> 00:29:09,399
Scott: You did not ask me any times.

499
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,806
Rym: I asked you many times.

500
00:29:10,866 --> 00:29:13,160
Scott: Anyway, I read some of that book yesterday.

501
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,013
Scott: The Kindle says that I am like 15% done.

502
00:29:15,033 --> 00:29:15,093
Scott: Oh.

503
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,500
Rym: So did the rabbits get to, did they meet any other rabbits yet?

504
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:22,075
Scott: They just met a rabbit who is weird.

505
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:25,840
Scott: He was really nice, but he was also just like, Hey, come on by if you want.

506
00:29:26,281 --> 00:29:28,898
Scott: And it seemed kind of probably something shady.

507
00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:29,180
Rym: Yeah.

508
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,514
Rym: Scott, those rabbits are cultist.

509
00:29:30,534 --> 00:29:35,020
Rym: You're going to be, you're going to really dig the, you know what is really thing about this book.

510
00:29:35,342 --> 00:29:38,060
Scott: And I'm probably should save this with the book club episode, but whatever.

511
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:38,441
Scott: Yeah.

512
00:29:38,966 --> 00:29:49,056
Scott: The rabbits, the main character, rabbits basically act the way it's like when you play RPG, a tabletop RPG, you basically don't trust anything.

513
00:29:49,196 --> 00:29:49,619
Rym: Oh my God.

514
00:29:49,659 --> 00:29:49,800
Rym: Yeah.

515
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,646
Rym: They're like, right.

516
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:54,573
Scott: And it's like, you're like, no, whatever it is we just encountered is bad.

517
00:29:54,674 --> 00:29:55,520
Scott: Oh, this is bad too.

518
00:29:56,401 --> 00:29:57,166
Scott: Everything is dangerous.

519
00:29:57,287 --> 00:30:00,505
Rym: Alex, our game master, you just introduced a new, new NPC.

520
00:30:00,685 --> 00:30:04,823
Rym: I'm going to assume that's a fucking demon in disguise and usually be right.

521
00:30:04,843 --> 00:30:09,487
Scott: So usually when you act like that, it's like people are like, that's so meta gaming.

522
00:30:09,668 --> 00:30:10,554
Scott: Oh, it's so bad.

523
00:30:10,896 --> 00:30:18,968
Scott: Uh, you know, but in this story here, these rabbits are acting just like that and they're not even RPG and they're just characters in the story.

524
00:30:19,029 --> 00:30:19,210
Scott: Yeah.

525
00:30:19,331 --> 00:30:19,754
Rym: There, you know what?

526
00:30:19,795 --> 00:30:22,269
Rym: It was very, I thought about that too.

527
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:23,856
Scott: But that's what rabbits are like.

528
00:30:23,957 --> 00:30:24,499
Rym: Yeah, they are.

529
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:29,939
Rym: You know, there's a term for that, but when a rabbit telescopes, it's when they like, there's something they want to check out.

530
00:30:30,221 --> 00:30:37,601
Rym: So they kind of lean their body, like they extend into a long tube, like just barely next to it, kind of poke it a little bit and then back away the fuck up and see what it did.

531
00:30:37,621 --> 00:30:41,440
Rym: It's all telescope in and back up and telescope in and back up.

532
00:30:41,641 --> 00:30:42,789
Scott: They also periscope.

533
00:30:43,656 --> 00:30:44,099
Rym: that they do.

534
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,414
Rym: They periscope up and then look left and right.

535
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:50,436
Rym: And then the air radar goes, and then go back in the grass.

536
00:30:50,899 --> 00:30:53,500
Rym: But yeah, it's just like us playing D and D like everything we pumped into.

537
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,009
Scott: We're like, meet this guy.

538
00:30:55,029 --> 00:30:55,874
Scott: He seems pretty nice.

539
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:56,720
Scott: And they're like, I don't know.

540
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,870
Scott: Can we trust this guy?

541
00:30:57,971 --> 00:30:58,960
Scott: We should dig a hole in the ground.

542
00:30:59,061 --> 00:31:00,772
Scott: It's not going to be safe with his brain.

543
00:31:00,793 --> 00:31:03,409
Rym: Well, the thing is, I mean, Fiverr was right in the beginning.

544
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:04,779
Rym: He's like, you're all going to fucking die.

545
00:31:06,181 --> 00:31:11,219
Scott: It's also mouse guard ask, or you could say that mouse guard is water ship down ask.

546
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:11,653
Rym: Yup.

547
00:31:13,724 --> 00:31:18,020
Rym: Well, mouse guard gives a little more tools in society.

548
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,255
Rym: Water ship down is a little more like just rabbits.

549
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:21,497
Scott: Yeah.

550
00:31:21,557 --> 00:31:22,745
Rym: Like they're, they're rabbits.

551
00:31:22,785 --> 00:31:25,120
Rym: They have the same capabilities that rabbits have.

552
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,025
Scott: They don't have swords.

553
00:31:26,326 --> 00:31:26,608
Rym: Yeah.

554
00:31:26,909 --> 00:31:27,834
Rym: They do meet a bird though.

555
00:31:28,257 --> 00:31:28,538
Scott: Okay.

556
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:28,820
Scott: Yeah.

557
00:31:30,523 --> 00:31:32,280
Rym: So the only other thing, cause you know, it's been a while.

558
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,628
Rym: We've we're on a long hiatus.

559
00:31:33,668 --> 00:31:37,520
Rym: We're back pretty much on our normal schedule, hopefully for the foreseeable future.

560
00:31:37,982 --> 00:31:42,390
Rym: I guess our thousandth episode happened at some point recently cause I was looking at the database round numbers.

561
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:42,792
Scott: Who cares?

562
00:31:42,974 --> 00:31:43,235
Rym: Yeah.

563
00:31:43,739 --> 00:31:48,944
Rym: Uh, I still kind of want to do a like nth episode party in New York at some point and I'm still looking into that.

564
00:31:49,426 --> 00:31:53,004
Rym: It'll be like the thousand and 30th episode party.

565
00:31:53,024 --> 00:31:53,508
Scott: It's all you.

566
00:31:54,436 --> 00:31:57,879
Rym: But uh, I made a YouTube video that I'm going to tell you about right now.

567
00:31:58,642 --> 00:32:02,520
Rym: I did a dramatic reading of the worlds of power book Castlevania two.

568
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,852
Scott: Haven't you been going on that for like three years?

569
00:32:04,872 --> 00:32:06,340
Rym: Uh, well no, I read it.

570
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,299
Rym: I didn't and I didn't really do anything with it.

571
00:32:08,681 --> 00:32:13,200
Rym: So our friend Judith and did an animatic of the very first bit of that.

572
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,034
Scott: Also, I'm better at dramatic reading than you.

573
00:32:15,054 --> 00:32:17,229
Rym: Uh, why don't we have dramatic reading off?

574
00:32:17,592 --> 00:32:17,934
Rym: Okay.

575
00:32:18,155 --> 00:32:20,328
Rym: Cause I point out, can I use any material I want?

576
00:32:20,711 --> 00:32:22,320
Rym: Uh, we should both use the same material.

577
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:22,781
Rym: I think.

578
00:32:23,686 --> 00:32:23,927
Scott: Why?

579
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:26,259
Rym: For, so it's a, we can do a blind test.

580
00:32:28,002 --> 00:32:28,288
Scott: Maybe.

581
00:32:28,308 --> 00:32:29,000
Scott: With strangers.

582
00:32:32,062 --> 00:32:33,490
Rym: Not so confident now, are you?

583
00:32:34,214 --> 00:32:34,556
Scott: We'll see.

584
00:32:34,898 --> 00:32:41,338
Rym: You're, you're really, you're gonna Scott, the source material I was working with, you know, how many times I edited out me laughing because I couldn't deal with it.

585
00:32:43,482 --> 00:32:45,695
Rym: So yeah, that video is on YouTube and it's pretty fucking awesome.

586
00:32:46,359 --> 00:32:46,479
Scott: Hmm.

587
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:54,180
Rym: So long, long time ago, uh, I bought a laptop and I got a weird Fujitsu like boutique power book.

588
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,920
Scott: Well that's, so you got to go even earlier than that.

589
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:00,440
Scott: Steve Pomeroy, who we knew in college, the trio thing he had or whatever.

590
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:08,180
Scott: No, well he had a Fujitsu P series laptop, which is the tiniest watt, you know, super wide screen, high resolution laptop.

591
00:33:08,341 --> 00:33:18,660
Scott: And it was really expensive for Japan, but it was awesome in that it was tiny, had incredible battery life considering as the early two thousands, cause you could put two batteries in it, one in the CD rom slot.

592
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:24,716
Scott: And despite being tiny and wide screen, like 10 inches plus, right?

593
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:30,160
Scott: Uh, the resolution on that screen was way high pixel density for the time.

594
00:33:30,501 --> 00:33:30,603
Rym: Yeah.

595
00:33:30,623 --> 00:33:34,680
Rym: You guys don't understand, but like power books did not exist until relatively recently.

596
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:42,600
Rym: The idea of a laptop that was small and powerful and had a long lasting battery, that shit didn't exist unless you imported something exotic, right?

597
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:52,440
Scott: Well the one he had had a weirdo CPU, but the ones that we got were the same, basically the same model a few years later and ours had like Intel real CPUs in them, like core whatnots.

598
00:33:53,761 --> 00:33:58,560
Scott: So, but again, weird boutique laptop because it's something you had to get from Japan that was expensive and whatnot.

599
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,293
Rym: So I had a lot of money for that fucking Fujitsu.

600
00:34:00,333 --> 00:34:03,216
Scott: It was like 2000, 2000 plus dollars, right?

601
00:34:03,236 --> 00:34:03,458
Scott: Yeah.

602
00:34:04,481 --> 00:34:10,940
Scott: But eventually even that amazing laptop was too slow and Fujitsu really didn't keep up with that product line very well.

603
00:34:11,261 --> 00:34:18,780
Rym: And also power books became a thing and Lenovo or you know, IBM, the X series think pads were pretty much like the only game in town.

604
00:34:19,041 --> 00:34:19,262
Rym: Yeah.

605
00:34:19,282 --> 00:34:24,755
Scott: I mean in terms of you want a laptop, this is before tablets were like, you know, they were just garbage in those days, right?

606
00:34:24,775 --> 00:34:25,480
Scott: Like viewsonic.

607
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:25,841
Rym: Yeah.

608
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,679
Rym: Don't be like, yeah, you should have bought a Microsoft service.

609
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:29,433
Rym: Like, yeah, nothing like that existed back then.

610
00:34:29,453 --> 00:34:29,553
Scott: Yeah.

611
00:34:29,574 --> 00:34:32,460
Scott: We're talking, you know, we were probably bought these while we were doing GeekNights.

612
00:34:32,781 --> 00:34:34,929
Rym: I'll look up exactly the day I bought mine.

613
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:35,772
Scott: Yeah.

614
00:34:36,475 --> 00:34:45,369
Scott: Uh, it's like, you know, I bought mine and I guess, you know, it was, it's a relatively small laptop, right?

615
00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:46,876
Scott: Like 12 inches.

616
00:34:46,976 --> 00:34:47,860
Scott: ish, right?

617
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,860
Scott: I have one at work also, but full powerful.

618
00:34:51,101 --> 00:34:56,679
Scott: If you don't want to do anything other than 3d gaming, because it doesn't have much of a video card, it doesn't Intel, whatever.

619
00:34:57,602 --> 00:34:58,647
Scott: It does everything else.

620
00:34:59,008 --> 00:35:02,245
Scott: Full power, plenty of Ram, plenty of CPU, plenty of everything.

621
00:35:02,265 --> 00:35:02,850
Scott: Okay.

622
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:06,446
Rym: So I bought my Fujitsu, Fujitsu P 8010 in 2008.

623
00:35:06,446 --> 00:35:06,748
Rym: Okay.

624
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,226
Scott: That was one newer than mine.

625
00:35:10,246 --> 00:35:12,538
Scott: I think mine was like a P seventh.

626
00:35:12,598 --> 00:35:12,960
Scott: I don't know.

627
00:35:13,401 --> 00:35:13,683
Rym: Yeah.

628
00:35:13,924 --> 00:35:14,529
Rym: That laptop.

629
00:35:14,569 --> 00:35:16,160
Rym: I still have it actually still works great.

630
00:35:17,203 --> 00:35:18,693
Scott: Mine was mine had some issues.

631
00:35:18,733 --> 00:35:19,015
Scott: I think.

632
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:19,780
Scott: I don't know what happened to it.

633
00:35:20,041 --> 00:35:20,264
Scott: Yeah.

634
00:35:20,385 --> 00:35:21,376
Scott: I think I gave it to someone.

635
00:35:21,477 --> 00:35:21,740
Scott: I don't know.

636
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,420
Rym: I remember having issues cause it was the end.

637
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,992
Rym: We needed a new laptop for panels.

638
00:35:25,032 --> 00:35:25,456
Rym: pretty much.

639
00:35:25,698 --> 00:35:25,879
Rym: Yeah.

640
00:35:26,921 --> 00:35:27,143
Rym: So yeah.

641
00:35:27,163 --> 00:35:29,133
Rym: Then you got the Lenovo X two 20.

642
00:35:29,133 --> 00:35:29,435
Rym: Mm hmm.

643
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,345
Scott: That's right at work.

644
00:35:31,365 --> 00:35:34,770
Scott: I have a two 30, which is a shitty touch pad, but as it still is the good keyboard.

645
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:35,011
Rym: Yeah.

646
00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:37,354
Rym: Well the thing is the Lenovo, they still have that two 20.

647
00:35:37,354 --> 00:35:37,536
Scott: Yes.

648
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,520
Rym: And I bought the two 30 because the two one I have at work was old.

649
00:35:41,641 --> 00:35:48,340
Scott: And the two 30 was just like the current one already, already that two 20 was really the last good one.

650
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,511
Scott: The touch pad, as I said in the two 30 sucked.

651
00:35:50,954 --> 00:35:54,100
Scott: And even beyond that, now the keyboard sucks and the touch pad sucks.

652
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,800
Rym: See I don't know what the fuck your beef is with that keyboard.

653
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:57,908
Rym: That keyboard's fine.

654
00:35:57,949 --> 00:35:59,120
Scott: Chiclet keyboards can suck my dick.

655
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,527
Rym: The chiclet keyboard is fine.

656
00:36:00,587 --> 00:36:01,874
Rym: I can type on it just fine.

657
00:36:02,216 --> 00:36:03,040
Scott: What is wrong with it?

658
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,373
Scott: I can type on it.

659
00:36:04,433 --> 00:36:05,140
Scott: What is wrong with it?

660
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:09,380
Scott: Just like I can drive a Yugo or a Ford Fiesta or whatever.

661
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:12,740
Rym: Also the touch pad on the X two 20 was no party.

662
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,474
Scott: No, it was not great, but the two 30 is worse.

663
00:36:16,581 --> 00:36:20,380
Rym: The two 30 was a substantial drop further into the toilet.

664
00:36:20,501 --> 00:36:21,124
Scott: Exactly.

665
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:24,500
Scott: The MacBook Pro touch pad is still the best.

666
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:30,960
Rym: To this day, but for the lack of multi-touch, that Fujitsu P8010 had, like that touch pad was a goddamn dream.

667
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,980
Scott: It was a tiny touch pad, but actually it was really, really good for what it was in its day.

668
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,780
Rym: It was so sensitive and so accurate.

669
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,620
Scott: It's still not as good as the Mac one.

670
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,218
Rym: Well, yeah, the Mac one is special.

671
00:36:41,238 --> 00:36:43,460
Rym: I mean, like the idea of multi-touch didn't even exist back then.

672
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:43,745
Scott: It's magic.

673
00:36:43,786 --> 00:36:44,478
Scott: Magic trackpad.

674
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:45,220
Rym: It is magic.

675
00:36:46,321 --> 00:36:54,739
Rym: So for the longest time, if anyone said, "I need a laptop," what I would ask them is, "Do you care about money, speed, battery life, or

676
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:54,840
Rym: size?".

677
00:36:54,901 --> 00:36:55,879
Scott: Do you really need a laptop?

678
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,880
Scott: You can probably get away with an iPad these days.

679
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,140
Rym: Yeah, but money, speed, battery life, size.

680
00:37:00,644 --> 00:37:01,859
Rym: What one do you care about?

681
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:06,860
Rym: And if the answer was everything except money, I would say get some crazy Japanese thing.

682
00:37:07,243 --> 00:37:11,594
Rym: And if the answer was everything, I would say get whatever the current Lenovo X2XX is.

683
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,262
Scott: Right.

684
00:37:13,745 --> 00:37:15,034
Scott: It's nice and small.

685
00:37:15,115 --> 00:37:15,900
Scott: It's powerful enough.

686
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:18,080
Scott: You just can't play crazy games on it.

687
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:22,220
Rym: But like my 230, it's got my 230.

688
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,760
Rym: I play Civ V on it like all the time on airplanes.

689
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,519
Scott: Yeah, but try to play like something, you know.

690
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,939
Rym: No, but Civ V works fine.

691
00:37:29,202 --> 00:37:29,432
Scott: Right.

692
00:37:29,515 --> 00:37:29,620
Scott: Sure.

693
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,979
Rym: That's what I need for my laptop.

694
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:40,599
Scott: Now, the other thing is that ever since forever, even the '90s, this is an old problem, PCs have come with pre-installed garbage on them.

695
00:37:41,381 --> 00:37:49,140
Scott: And then, I've said this a million times, but I guess this is the show to say it again once and for all, the reputation of Windows is not a good reputation.

696
00:37:49,602 --> 00:37:52,860
Scott: Even people are not computer experts, and many who are hate Windows.

697
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,280
Rym: Now, some of that is legitimate.

698
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,540
Rym: I mean, old versions of Windows.

699
00:37:55,900 --> 00:38:08,540
Scott: Windows is not perfect by any means, but much of the bad reputation of Windows itself comes from the fact that most people who use Windows use Windows that came pre-installed on a computer with a bunch of garbage installed.

700
00:38:08,681 --> 00:38:18,000
Scott: And that if you use a clean Windows install from a disk that has not been modified or had any garbage added to it in any way, it is vastly superior.

701
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:20,034
Scott: This has been true even since Windows 3.1 days.

702
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:26,920
Scott: The computers had come with garbage that would ruin it, and you wouldn't get the real Windows experience, et cetera.

703
00:38:27,381 --> 00:38:37,960
Rym: Now, the benefit of Lenovo's was that they came with a comparatively small amount of garbage layer, and it was all like Lenovo-owned system configurator optimization garbage.

704
00:38:38,081 --> 00:38:44,360
Scott: I never, ever buy a computer that has pre-installed shit, and when I do, because a laptop, you had no choice, really.

705
00:38:44,965 --> 00:38:46,520
Scott: I would clean install the Windows.

706
00:38:47,503 --> 00:38:58,740
Scott: And even the Lenovo, though, you could get away without cleaning, installing the Windows because all they put on there, the only bullshit was like they replaced the Windows Wi-Fi thing with this other Wi-Fi thing.

707
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,020
Rym: - Which you could just uninstall.

708
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:07,699
Scott: - Right, and if you went to program settings, uninstall, and removed it, it actually removed, and the Windows Wi-Fi thing took over, and it worked just fine.

709
00:39:08,142 --> 00:39:11,400
Scott: So it's like, oh, this is actually not the worst.

710
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:12,777
Scott: They didn't put like AOL icons.

711
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:35,800
Scott: It was only like these system utilities things, and actually one of them was useful because the particular Wi-Fi thing that they, the card that's in there, at least on my Lenovo, Windows keeps popping up this thing occasionally when you connect to Wi-Fi where you have to click on yes, and one of the things that they pre-install is a patch to Windows that makes that dialogue not pop up.

712
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:39,418
Rym: - You know that some engineer was like motherfucker, and he just wrote a patch.

713
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:50,238
Scott: - Yeah, it's like a stop Intel Wi-Fi pop-up thing, and you can actually see it in the program settings as a thing to uninstall, and you can go to the Lenovo website and download it and install it.

714
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,195
Scott: - I did, yeah.

715
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:55,940
Scott: - In case, if you do a clean install of Windows, you can go get this thing and install it to make the pop-up stuff happening.

716
00:39:56,020 --> 00:40:01,480
Rym: - The one thing I left on my 230 was the battery management thing 'cause it did give me a lot more accessible options.

717
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:06,380
Scott: - Sure, I still hate that it replaces the real Windows battery software, which is perfectly fine.

718
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:12,980
Rym: - But at least it added functionality, and I did see side-by-side comparisons where if you use it, the battery lasts longer.

719
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,740
Scott: - Sure, I mean, that's obviously definitely possible, but why did they have to do that?

720
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:24,560
Scott: Why couldn't they just make a battery power driver and have it installed via Windows Update just like every other driver?

721
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:28,340
Rym: - Yeah, well, no, I agree, but these are minor niggling issues.

722
00:40:28,902 --> 00:40:37,960
Scott: - Sure, compared to the other options, Dells, HPs, et cetera, the Lenovo ThinkPad was like a dream in terms of not having a bunch of garbage pre-installed.

723
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:41,229
Scott: You could get away without clean installing the Windows if you wanted to, right?

724
00:40:42,641 --> 00:40:45,600
Scott: Now, I've always said, Microsoft, this is really your fault.

725
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:50,420
Scott: What you should do is you should say, "Hey, look, Dell, look, HP, look whoever.

726
00:40:51,105 --> 00:40:52,220
Scott: "You wanna pre-install Windows.

727
00:40:52,281 --> 00:40:53,579
Scott: "and all these computers you're selling, right?

728
00:40:53,822 --> 00:40:55,717
Scott: "Otherwise, you're not gonna be able to sell 'em "'cause you don't have an OS.

729
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,252
Scott: "You're gonna put Linux on there, ha ha

730
00:40:57,292 --> 00:40:57,373
Scott: ha.".

731
00:40:58,201 --> 00:41:03,480
Scott: So we sell you Windows licenses at a bulk discount 'cause your business is mad low margins.

732
00:41:03,863 --> 00:41:05,680
Scott: You need to have this discount on the Windows license.

733
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:12,620
Scott: 'cause if you had to pay the full Windows license cost, man, you'd be as expensive as the Mac and your hardware is garbage compared to that.

734
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:18,140
Scott: And you can't make better hardware 'cause you suck, so without our cheap Windows license, you're pretty much fucked.

735
00:41:18,861 --> 00:41:20,219
Scott: So here's the deal we're gonna make you.

736
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:23,020
Scott: We'll continue to sell you the discount Windows license.

737
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:32,499
Scott: Maybe we'll even discount it further if you agree to not pre-install any software whatsoever and deliver only the clean Windows experience that we have designed.

738
00:41:33,004 --> 00:41:38,060
Scott: If you pre-install anything whatsoever, then either we're not gonna give you any contract.

739
00:41:38,461 --> 00:41:41,040
Scott: You can buy Windows licenses at full retail price.

740
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:41,759
Scott: Go fuck yourself.

741
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:47,760
Scott: And if Microsoft had done that years ago, the reputation of Windows today would be much, much better.

742
00:41:49,764 --> 00:41:53,340
Scott: And even now, if they did it, it's a bit late, but better late than never.

743
00:41:53,421 --> 00:41:56,420
Scott: They could do this today as soon as their current contracts expire.

744
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,420
Scott: - But they don't and they won't.

745
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:05,439
Rym: - They didn't back then, so the people who sell computers to make more and more money would bundle a bunch of crapware that they were paid to bundle.

746
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:09,740
Scott: - Yeah, some of the crapware they put, like the Lenovo Wi-Fi thing, it's like no one's paying for that.

747
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:10,760
Scott: I don't know why they, you know.

748
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,695
Rym: - Yeah, no one would go to a store and say, "I would like to buy the Lenovo Power Manager for

749
00:42:14,695 --> 00:42:16,001
Rym: $5.".

750
00:42:16,001 --> 00:42:21,460
Scott: - Right, but some other stuff they put on there, such as like, you know, aha, install McAfee.

751
00:42:22,601 --> 00:42:34,520
Scott: (laughing) Right, you know, that stuff, McAfee paid the money, you know, to put it on there and that decreased the cost of the laptop, you know, which already has a-- - I would argue it didn't decrease the cost of the laptop.

752
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:40,239
Scott: - Well, it already has a razor-thin margin, so it increased the margin, right, if you think about it that way.

753
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:45,080
Rym: - So let's back up a little bit because there's one other piece of this puzzle before we get to what's going on here.

754
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:54,140
Rym: So way back in 2005, when I still worked at IBM, IBM basically sold its PC business to Lenovo.

755
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:58,260
Scott: - Right, IBM made computers for a lot, you know.

756
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:03,239
Rym: - The best like business, I do things with computers, laptops, there were for a long time.

757
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,320
Scott: - The IBM ThinkPad.

758
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:04,749
Scott: - Yeah.

759
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:11,619
Scott: - And, you know, they also made pretty good desktops and also, you know, we had an IBM desktop way back in the day.

760
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:16,520
Rym: - So when that deal happened, I was super untrusting of Lenovo.

761
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:19,060
Scott: - Yeah, I was like, whoa, they're selling this business off.

762
00:43:19,141 --> 00:43:20,620
Scott: Is the ThinkPad gonna die, right?

763
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:23,698
Rym: - Yeah, they're selling it to some like dubious-looking Chinese company.

764
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:30,558
Scott: - This company makes an important product that I wanna buy, and they're selling that product to some shady company I never heard of.

765
00:43:31,344 --> 00:43:35,620
Scott: Is that product now going to be ruined and I need to find something else to get instead?

766
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,279
Scott: Is that what's going to happen here?

767
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:43,399
Scott: I was very concerned, you know, even though IBM was still making, you know, giant servers that I'm never gonna buy.

768
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:54,999
Rym: - So the fears I saw online in general were one, people were afraid that because it was a Chinese company, the hardware and the software and everything would be compromised for spy shit.

769
00:43:56,002 --> 00:44:00,259
Rym: And the other fear was that the hardware would just get shittier.

770
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:05,560
Scott: - Right, well I mean, you know, there's racism against China, but there's also truth in some of that, right?

771
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:07,580
Rym: - Yeah, there is, in fact.

772
00:44:08,901 --> 00:44:12,320
Scott: Although the third fear was that there would be no more good support.

773
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:16,100
Scott: - What was that Chinese cell phone company that made actually super shady cell phones?

774
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:18,660
Rym: - Oh yeah, I almost used that as my news.

775
00:44:19,161 --> 00:44:20,619
Rym: I've got it open in a tab here somewhere.

776
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,259
Scott: - That was a year or two ago.

777
00:44:23,044 --> 00:44:26,759
Scott: I've seen ads for their phones on the subway at like Metro PCS, you can get those.

778
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:29,019
Rym: - Yeah, well there was some recent news about that.

779
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:29,480
Rym: - Really?

780
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:31,520
Rym: - Yeah, but I didn't, it's on a tab somewhere here.

781
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:32,157
Scott: - Anyway.

782
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:47,660
Rym: - So that happened, and actually, I was really, I didn't, like I wouldn't buy any Lenovo stuff or IBM stuff until like a generation of products came out and people said, oh, like the new laptops are pretty much just as good as the old laptops.

783
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,339
Scott: - Yeah, it's like, yeah, they pretty much just kept it going, they didn't fuck it up.

784
00:44:50,641 --> 00:44:52,538
Scott: Good job, Lenovo, you didn't fuck it up.

785
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:53,039
Rym: - Yup.

786
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,279
Scott: - At least not right away.

787
00:44:54,643 --> 00:44:56,299
Rym: Then Lenovo fucked it up, so what happened?

788
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,559
Scott: - Just now they fucked it up.

789
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:05,260
Rym: - They fucked it up in a way to where when this news first dropped, 'cause this is pretty recent news, I assumed it was false.

790
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,180
Scott: - Yeah.

791
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:13,380
Rym: - Because there were reports that Lenovo laptops had bundled malware that was injecting ads.

792
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:24,560
Scott: - Right, I assumed that this was just like, you know, they were definitely bundling something 'cause they all bundle some bullshit, but that it was overblown and the truth was much, much tamer, as is often the case.

793
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:26,560
Rym: - But no, it was underblown.

794
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,600
Scott: - It was definitely underblown.

795
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:33,719
Rym: - Lenovo was bundling something called Superfish, which is a fucking shady company to begin with.

796
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:41,060
Scott: - So Superfish paid Lenovo money to put Superfish software pre-installed onto laptops and they did so for a period of time.

797
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:47,640
Rym: - Yes, now details of what that relationship is are probably gonna come out in the court cases that are coming out of all of this.

798
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:47,935
Scott: - Sure.

799
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:55,280
Rym: - It appears that the State Department is interested, Microsoft has already added Superfish to their anti-virus definitions.

800
00:45:55,860 --> 00:46:01,620
Scott: - Really, the government could also take action on this and say, you guys can't sell things with shit pre-installed.

801
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:05,660
Rym: - They may well, there's already at least one major lawsuit.

802
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:12,920
Scott: - In fact, they could even say, if you're selling hardware, you can't have any software pre-installed, make it come separately on a disk.

803
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:18,079
Rym: - On Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security made a big fucking deal about this thing, too.

804
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:19,618
Scott: - Yeah, well, rightly so.

805
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:26,100
Rym: - Yes, so this software, this Superfish thing, I'll explain it in terms that everyone will understand.

806
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:31,980
Scott: - Right, so you turn on your brand new computer, you log into Windows for the first time and there's some Superfish thing, what the fuck is that?

807
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:34,040
Rym: - So you wouldn't know it's there, you would never see it.

808
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,040
Scott: - It's not in the system tray, I'm sorry, notification area.

809
00:46:38,081 --> 00:46:40,679
Scott: It's not in the program settings where I can uninstall it.

810
00:46:41,261 --> 00:46:46,460
Scott: There's no indication anywhere that I have this thing and can get rid of it like there is with the other software.

811
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:50,440
Rym: - It's just malware and what it does, one, is it literally--.

812
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:57,160
Scott: - And this wasn't something that somebody snuck in in the factory modifying the image that they were putting that was getting copied to all the drives.

813
00:46:57,502 --> 00:47:01,720
Scott: This was something someone paid to have put in that image and Lenovo said yes and put it there.

814
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:12,620
Rym: - Yep, Mark Hopkins, who, I forget what his job is at the Lenovo, but he basically was the one who said, "We messed up with this and we're gonna roll it back.

815
00:47:13,341 --> 00:47:15,352
Rym: "and please stop being mad at

816
00:47:15,553 --> 00:47:15,633
Rym: us.".

817
00:47:17,625 --> 00:47:24,774
Rym: The funny thing is, at first, when this news first broke, they didn't say like, "Fuck Superfish, we fucked up, "we're sorry, we didn't

818
00:47:24,814 --> 00:47:24,976
Rym: know.".

819
00:47:25,421 --> 00:47:30,315
Rym: They basically said, "We're temporarily suspending "the rollout of Superfish until we address these

820
00:47:30,355 --> 00:47:30,939
Rym: concerns.".

821
00:47:31,603 --> 00:47:34,780
Rym: So already, fuck them, they were 100% in on this from the beginning.

822
00:47:35,701 --> 00:47:40,120
Rym: One, it literally injects ads into your web browsing.

823
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:43,840
Scott: - So if I'm browsing the web, there's gonna be ads there.

824
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:46,419
Scott: Is it gonna replace ads I normally see?

825
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:48,380
Rym: - No, look at this screenshot.

826
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:50,392
Rym: Went to Google, typed Intel 7260 AC.

827
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:54,940
Scott: - So they're searching for a router to buy.

828
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:59,399
Rym: - The top result is this store where you can buy it.

829
00:48:00,123 --> 00:48:07,040
Rym: that was injected by the malware and then the visual search results, which were also injected by the malware.

830
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:19,239
Scott: - So it actually modified the Google search results page and added stuff to that page, even though, in addition to not replacing anything Google put there, but adding more shit.

831
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,239
Rym: - Yes, it may have done more too.

832
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,940
Scott: - So could not Google sue Superfish for doing this?

833
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:25,940
Rym: - We'll see what happens, like I said.

834
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:28,360
Scott: - 'Cause I'm pretty sure Google's way bigger than Superfish.

835
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:35,760
Rym: - This went down really recently and the lawsuits are just beginning as of today.

836
00:48:36,641 --> 00:48:40,180
Rym: So it injected ads and spied on all your browsing behavior.

837
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:41,818
Rym: It also included--.

838
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:44,180
Scott: - Where did it send your browsing behavior, to Superfish?

839
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:45,330
Rym: - Up here.

840
00:48:45,391 --> 00:48:45,780
Rym: so, yes.

841
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:46,880
Scott: - Some Chinese server somewhere?

842
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:48,038
Rym: - We're gonna find out.

843
00:48:49,287 --> 00:48:50,139
Rym: So it did more too.

844
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:58,040
Rym: It injected a self-signed certificate and left a ready-made, man-in-the-middle SSL attack.

845
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:12,499
Rym: So if you use one of these computers, you go to Gmail, Gmail has that lock, it's certified SSL, your communication's encrypted, through their certificate locally so they can spy on literally everything you do.

846
00:49:13,864 --> 00:49:17,617
Scott: - Oh, so I'm communicating with Gmail with just HTTP and not HTTPS?

847
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:23,140
Rym: - Well basically they're using their own certificate so they can decrypt your communication.

848
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:25,380
Rym: There's a man-in-the-middle attack.

849
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:35,400
Scott: - Oh, so I'm communicating with Google with SSL but I'm not using the certificate that my computer would normally use, I'm using one that they made, right?

850
00:49:35,541 --> 00:49:44,000
Scott: So it's like if I'm making a phone call and I think I'm holding my phone but I'm actually calling their office first and then they're making the call to Google.

851
00:49:44,282 --> 00:49:46,500
Scott: And even though it's encrypted, they're decrypting everything.

852
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:48,379
Rym: - So I try to call my bank.

853
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,440
Rym: My phone actually calls Scott.

854
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,620
Rym: Scott just passes me right through to Google and records the whole conversation.

855
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,599
Scott: - I take two phones and hold one of them upside down.

856
00:49:56,062 --> 00:49:57,318
Scott: So he's talking to the bank.

857
00:49:58,423 --> 00:50:00,240
Scott: But I'm listening in, I got it next to my head.

858
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:02,860
Rym: - In fact, here's a screenshot showing the certificate.

859
00:50:04,041 --> 00:50:05,300
Rym: I mean, this shit is just egregious.

860
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:06,580
Rym: This is the kind of thing that spies would use.

861
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:20,599
Scott: - So you think that you are doing perfectly safe web browsing 'cause you go to your bank's website, you go to Google, you read your Gmail, and that green lock is green, but that's because something has been added to your web browser in advance.

862
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:22,780
Rym: - So even better.

863
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:25,520
Scott: - Did they just add this to the IE that is part of the computer?

864
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:28,820
Scott: If you install a Chrome separately, would it then--.

865
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:34,200
Rym: - I saw some reports that Firefox at least did not use that key store, but I'm not 100% sure.

866
00:50:34,341 --> 00:50:37,539
Scott: - Oh, it adds it to a Windows key store that's shared between browsers?

867
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:37,920
Scott: - Yeah, OS level.

868
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:44,160
Scott: - So if you use a different browser or something, like, that doesn't use that, you might not be spied upon.

869
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:48,180
Rym: I haven't, like, I don't have anything with supervision on it to poke at it.

870
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:52,080
Scott: - But even still, any, you know, normal application that just uses, like--.

871
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:59,820
Rym: - Yes, Microsoft Firefox is not affected, or does not appear to be affected by the man in the middle issue because it maintains its own certificate store, but the ads are still injected.

872
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:05,320
Scott: - But the ads are still there 'cause it's basically looking at all outgoing HTTP traffic, probably on a lower level.

873
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:08,740
Rym: - So listen to this shit-eating response.

874
00:51:09,103 --> 00:51:11,180
Rym: This is an official response from Lenovo.

875
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:12,419
Scott: - Lenovo or Superfish?

876
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:13,118
Rym: - Lenovo.

877
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:14,180
Scott: - So who's Superfish?

878
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:14,980
Scott: Where's this company?

879
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:18,280
Rym: - This is the shady-ass company that provides this software.

880
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:19,480
Rym: They're basically the bonsai buddy.

881
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:20,429
Scott: - Right, but who are they?

882
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:22,039
Scott: What have they said?

883
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:23,960
Rym: - I believe they're an Israeli company.

884
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:25,700
Rym: - Uh-huh, okay.

885
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:35,898
Rym: - And I don't wanna talk a lot about what Superfish is because there's a lot of conflicting information as to who might really be behind this, and there's a lot of--.

886
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,279
Scott: - Conspiracy nuts?

887
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:42,659
Rym: - Yes, but at the same time, some of what they're saying actually pretty legitimate.

888
00:51:43,546 --> 00:51:44,500
Rym: I haven't done enough research.

889
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:46,440
Scott: - It could be anyone, anyway.

890
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:51,460
Rym: - Superfish is a private advertising company that develops various advertising, super generic company.

891
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,880
Scott: - It's just an evil advertising company with no morals.

892
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:54,720
Rym: Okay, continue.

893
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:57,860
Rym: - But it was made by, okay, there's a bunch of information.

894
00:51:58,441 --> 00:52:01,200
Rym: It was made by this guy who graduated from Tel Aviv University.

895
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:04,879
Rym: Multiple links computer science, computer surveillance industry.

896
00:52:05,742 --> 00:52:08,120
Rym: There's a weird chain of custody of--.

897
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:11,758
Scott: - Is there a note on this Wikipedia page about needing, you know, change--.

898
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:13,720
Rym: - No, there's citations for all these things.

899
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:14,558
Scott: - Alrighty then.

900
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:22,080
Rym: - Yeah, so anyway, I don't wanna get into that stuff, but the self-signed certificate's password was also discovered.

901
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,420
Rym: So basically, there is a built-in vulnerability.

902
00:52:26,062 --> 00:52:31,080
Rym: I, myself, can sign shit using the same certificate that is built into your Lenovo computer.

903
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:39,199
Scott: - So the certificate that was added to all these computers that shouldn't have been there, right, is an easily decrypted certificate because-- - The password is commodia.

904
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:43,020
Scott: - The password is a stupid password that someone figured out and distributed.

905
00:52:43,582 --> 00:52:52,820
Scott: So anyone who knows that password, which is literally anyone who wants to, and has a copy of OpenSSL-- - So commodia is yet another shady company.

906
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:53,500
Rym: - Oh.

907
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:59,493
Rym: - Commodia, quote from another article, a company that brazenly calls one of its software development kits an SSL

908
00:52:59,553 --> 00:53:11,800
Scott: hijacker-- - So the password for the certificate used in the Superfish shitty software is the name of a shady company that does something similar and related, implying that the same people were behind both things.

909
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:19,380
Rym: - So that shady-ass software is in a ton of other programs, it looks like, and is widely deployed as malware on the internet.

910
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:22,559
Scott: - So people who, so basically what happens is--.

911
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:24,600
Rym: - And most of those companies are Israeli.

912
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:34,600
Scott: - So people wanna make a shitty malware and they wanna snoop HTTP traffic, including SSL traffic, so they buy commodia and put commodia in their software.

913
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:36,559
Scott: Superfish is really a customer of commodia.

914
00:53:37,104 --> 00:53:40,640
Scott: They need, they're like, man, we gotta snoop on the SSL traffic, too, to get our ads in there.

915
00:53:41,122 --> 00:53:46,620
Scott: Let's pay commodia money for their thing that lets us snoop on the SSL traffic with the certificate.

916
00:53:46,920 --> 00:54:01,820
Rym: - So I suspect that at least one of the parties involved here was just greedy, and another party involved here is actively malicious, either on behalf of shady darknet hackers, whatever, or government spying, NSA, whatever.

917
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:13,239
Scott: - Right, so not only is Superfish spying in all your shit, but because they're spying in all your shit, you've basically now have a big, wide-open back door for anyone who knows anything about computers to spy on your shit also.

918
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:15,820
Rym: - So the response to this has been massive.

919
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,660
Rym: Microsoft added it to their antivirus definitions basically immediately.

920
00:54:20,441 --> 00:54:33,458
Rym: The NSA, Homeland Security, everyone is going apeshit, there's lawsuits against Lenovo, and Lenovo's shit-eating statement, which is what I was getting back to, I gotta find my tab again, really gets to the crux of this.

921
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:39,040
Rym: Quote, let's see, "Superfish was previously included "on some consumer notebook products.

922
00:54:39,121 --> 00:54:41,260
Rym: "shipped in a short window between September and December.

923
00:54:41,643 --> 00:54:45,415
Rym: "to help customers potentially discover "interesting products while

924
00:54:45,496 --> 00:54:45,880
Rym: shopping.".

925
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:46,958
Scott: - That is what it does.

926
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:50,196
Rym: - Yep, that is also one of the more shit-eating things I have ever read.

927
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,380
Scott: - That's three months that they was in, okay.

928
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:52,820
Scott: - Further quote.

929
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:54,480
Scott: - How many laptops do they sell on those?

930
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:55,258
Scott: At least it's not us.

931
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:56,719
Rym: - Oh yeah, it's not us for sure.

932
00:54:57,183 --> 00:55:00,019
Rym: I don't trust that there isn't a vulnerability on my Lenovo, though.

933
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:01,780
Scott: - Yeah, but it would be in the hardware or something, right?

934
00:55:01,861 --> 00:55:03,120
Scott: Because I clean installed the windows.

935
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:04,460
Rym: - Quote, further quote.

936
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:07,980
Scott: - Unless it's in the pop-up removing patch.

937
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:08,296
Scott: - Yeah.

938
00:55:09,081 --> 00:55:14,639
Rym: We have thoroughly investigated this technology and do not find any evidence to submit substantiate security concerns.

939
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:18,580
Scott: - Well, you have not researched it thoroughly enough because everyone else did.

940
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:25,480
Rym: - But we know that users reacted to this issue with concern and so we have taken direct action to stop shipping any products with this software.

941
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:27,260
Scott: We will continue doing what we do.

942
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:31,080
Scott: - Well, actually, you said you stopped in December, but this is February already, so what happened in January?

943
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:32,100
Scott: - Yeah, so--.

944
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:33,620
Scott: - Why didn't you ship it in January?

945
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,740
Rym: - Basically, here's the result.

946
00:55:37,482 --> 00:55:41,080
Rym: Never buy any Lenovo product again because that company cannot be trusted.

947
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,920
Scott: This was a supreme breach.

948
00:55:43,281 --> 00:55:52,858
Rym: Either they are greedy and incompetent and let these other shitware companies and these spies get into their software or they're complicit in it.

949
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:54,597
Rym: Either one is equally bad.

950
00:55:55,120 --> 00:56:01,940
Scott: - You need to never, ever, ever under any circumstance buy a computer that has anything except a clean OS installed.

951
00:56:02,181 --> 00:56:15,280
Scott: and Apple is actually, despite us saying things about the early part of the show, they're not perfect, but one thing Apple has always gotten right is they don't allow anyone to fuck with the software that's installed on the devices.

952
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,500
Scott: That's a large reason that they also make the hardware.

953
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:32,099
Scott: Way back in the day, way, way back, when Steve Jobs ran the original show, he was selling Apple products and then he got really mad when people were selling Macs that weren't made by Apple.

954
00:56:33,041 --> 00:56:34,820
Scott: There were Macs that were not made by Apple.

955
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:40,073
Scott: It was just like PCs where anyone could make one and he was super pissed and he was like, "They shouldn't be allowed to do

956
00:56:40,114 --> 00:56:40,317
Scott: that.".

957
00:56:42,182 --> 00:56:46,178
Scott: And on the one hand, it's like, "Well, I sort of think they should be allowed to do

958
00:56:46,218 --> 00:56:46,379
Scott: that.".

959
00:56:46,602 --> 00:57:16,659
Scott: Even today, I think people should be allowed to make a computer and just install OS on it, but he was correct in some ways in that even though I think that having different hardware is not really ruining the experience, at least compared to the one button mouse of the official Mac, someone fucking with the software and giving you something other than just the OS, putting other software in that you did not want, that should not be allowed pretty much ever.

960
00:57:17,602 --> 00:57:21,960
Scott: It's like if I go to the store and buy an Apple and I say, "I would like this Apple, please,".

961
00:57:22,383 --> 00:57:26,371
Scott: and they put a banana in my bag with the Apple, it's like, "What the fuck?

962
00:57:26,411 --> 00:57:26,835
Scott: I don't want the

963
00:57:26,875 --> 00:57:27,218
Scott: banana.".

964
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:30,180
Scott: I mean, no, a free banana, I might not complain.

965
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:31,339
Scott: I might want the free banana.

966
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:33,680
Rym: Well, what if the banana has microchips in it?

967
00:57:33,901 --> 00:57:34,919
Scott: What if it's a poison?

968
00:57:35,562 --> 00:57:38,680
Scott: What if it's a bad old banana they're just trying to get rid of because they all turn brown?

969
00:57:38,861 --> 00:57:43,779
Scott: or a banana they can't sell because it's too green and it's going to go from green to brown because you know how bananas are?

970
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,399
Scott: Or, you know, who knows what?

971
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:52,540
Rym: But it's like-- You know, I do know how bananas are because I currently actually own too many bananas and every morning for two days-- I only have one left, I'll take some.

972
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:57,913
Rym: You take some bananas because I looked at them this morning, I was like, "Whoa, those got way more yellow than they should be by

973
00:57:57,954 --> 00:57:58,257
Rym: today.".

974
00:57:58,500 --> 00:57:59,580
Scott: Yeah, I'm going to make some banana bread.

975
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:00,340
Scott: They were green yesterday.

976
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,100
Scott: Today is National Banana Bread Day.

977
00:58:02,794 --> 00:58:02,879
Scott: Oh.

978
00:58:03,162 --> 00:58:03,637
Scott: Did you know that?

979
00:58:03,844 --> 00:58:04,014
Scott: No.

980
00:58:04,566 --> 00:58:04,938
Scott: Now you did.

981
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:06,439
Rym: I should use the banana bread.

982
00:58:06,843 --> 00:58:07,336
Scott: Go for it.

983
00:58:09,210 --> 00:58:09,400
Scott: Right.

984
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:16,120
Scott: You know, you should not be able to force upon someone something in addition to what they are buying from you, right?

985
00:58:16,622 --> 00:58:27,220
Scott: So, if I buy a copy of OS X or a copy of Windows, you should not be able to force or even attempt to trick me into taking additional things that I do not want.

986
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,560
Rym: What if those things are now just part of the operating system?

987
00:58:30,062 --> 00:58:30,820
Rym: Like a web browser.

988
00:58:33,165 --> 00:58:34,840
Scott: We had a discussion about that.

989
00:58:35,083 --> 00:58:35,340
Rym: I know.

990
00:58:36,342 --> 00:58:41,300
Scott: Right, but I mean, it should be clear that like, you know, what's included in the package, right?

991
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:51,065
Rym: So Lenovo or Microsoft could-- Microsoft has a vested interest in not being party to this-- could just buy this super fish stuff and just, "Oh, it's our software.

992
00:58:51,086 --> 00:58:52,032
Rym: It's Lenovo's

993
00:58:52,073 --> 00:58:52,476
Rym: software.".

994
00:58:53,485 --> 00:58:54,700
Scott: That's the thing, but it's not.

995
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:55,960
Scott: It's Microsoft's software.

996
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:56,068
Scott: Yeah.

997
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:57,420
Scott: It's Lenovo's hardware.

998
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:00,700
Scott: The real answer is-- But yeah, Apple, notice how you buy a MacBook.

999
00:59:00,941 --> 00:59:01,899
Scott: It's got OS X on it.

1000
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:02,840
Scott: You buy an iPhone.

1001
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:04,879
Scott: They don't let Verizon put shit on the iPhone.

1002
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:06,518
Scott: You buy it from Verizon, right?

1003
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:10,780
Scott: But the Android phones are full of garbage from the manufacturers and the carriers.

1004
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:19,500
Rym: This has been a problem for a long time, but it's never been this severe of a problem, at least not in a publicly identifiable way.

1005
00:59:20,844 --> 00:59:30,980
Rym: The level of breach that this Lenovo vulnerability is, is to the point where you should literally burn all commercial ties with Lenovo and never, ever buy one of their products again.

1006
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:43,040
Scott: Now, wait, what if I'm from a company and I gotta buy computers for my employees and I gotta buy laptops, but every single company that makes laptops is pre-installing some kind of shit on there.

1007
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:46,940
Rym: I would still go with anyone but Lenovo because Lenovo didn't just install shit.

1008
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:48,300
Rym: They installed active malware.

1009
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:49,719
Scott: All right, so who am I going for?

1010
00:59:49,901 --> 00:59:50,557
Scott: I don't know, Dell.

1011
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:52,380
Scott: Great, thanks.

1012
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:53,299
Scott: That's really good help.

1013
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:53,900
Rym: That's fine.

1014
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,120
Scott: My employees will be so happy with their garbage laptops.

1015
00:59:56,260 --> 01:00:02,800
Rym: Your employees don't even know, and anyone who knows is at a company where they just buy their own laptop with a corporate car.

1016
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:11,640
Scott: Luckily, the Microsoft Surface made by, at least, I don't know if it's, you know, Microsoft actually manufactures the hardware, but it doesn't seem like they pre-install any bullshit on there.

1017
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:14,140
Scott: It seems like it's just Windows 'cause it's the Microsoft Surface.

1018
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:18,500
Rym: Yeah, well, you know what, too, I had to buy a bunch of computers for work, right, just 'cause the CTO was busy?

1019
01:00:18,704 --> 01:00:18,880
Rym: Yeah.

1020
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:25,680
Rym: So I use that iBuyPower, and it comes with, like, those PCs just come with a completely clean Windows.

1021
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:31,560
Scott: Yeah, iBuyPower is basically go on Newegg, design the computer with some more limited choices.

1022
01:00:31,742 --> 01:00:32,300
Scott: And we'll build it.

1023
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:41,478
Scott: And they put it together for you to save you the trouble, but it's otherwise just like a computer you would've made, perhaps even better because the guy wiring it wired, like, 50 computers today.

1024
01:00:42,141 --> 01:00:48,520
Rym: And if there is some sort of secret, nefarious vulnerability in it, it's at least secret and hidden, and no one knows about it.

1025
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:49,754
Scott: No one said anything, which means...

1026
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:53,120
Rym: This Lenovo thing is just like a disaster from every perspective.

1027
01:00:53,542 --> 01:00:57,440
Rym: So you can't trust them because even if they're not evil, they're desperately incompetent.

1028
01:00:58,141 --> 01:01:01,860
Rym: At least if Dell is doing something evil, they're competent enough to hide it.

1029
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:06,900
Scott: If we're gonna spend a thousand-plus dollars in a computer, you don't want one from someone so incompetent and/or evil.

1030
01:01:07,161 --> 01:01:07,423
Rym: Yup.

1031
01:01:07,785 --> 01:01:12,119
Rym: And really, it's the statements Lenovo made is why I feel that way.

1032
01:01:12,541 --> 01:01:15,278
Rym: Because the level of shit that was eaten...

1033
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:25,154
Scott: The statement they should've said was, "We installed Superfish on the computers during this time period because they paid us money to do so, and we admit we were

1034
01:01:25,175 --> 01:01:25,759
Scott: incompetent.".

1035
01:01:25,925 --> 01:01:26,055
Scott: Yup.

1036
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:27,020
Scott: Because you can't admit you're evil.

1037
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,898
Rym: If they had disavowed Superfish, day one.

1038
01:01:29,141 --> 01:01:33,159
Scott: "We admit that we were incompetent and did not realize how horrible the software was.

1039
01:01:33,281 --> 01:01:38,280
Scott: We did realize it eventually, and that's why we stopped allowing it in January.

1040
01:01:39,103 --> 01:01:42,256
Scott: And we already have a patch in our website where you can go get a thing that will remove

1041
01:01:42,316 --> 01:01:42,357
Scott: it.".

1042
01:01:43,581 --> 01:01:50,359
Rym: But no, the fact that they said they evaluated it and thought it was fine and only recanted later when people proved they were lying.

1043
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:50,841
Scott: Right.

1044
01:01:50,942 --> 01:01:56,518
Scott: You just admit the incompetence from the get-go, because otherwise you gotta admit the evil, which is not... You can't be doing that.

1045
01:01:57,361 --> 01:02:00,360
Rym: So my X230 will be the last Lenovo product I will ever own.

1046
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:04,320
Rym: Luckily, I won't need another laptop for like five more years with the way we're going.

1047
01:02:04,381 --> 01:02:10,640
Scott: Literally, all I need the laptop for these days is the few things, if I'm on the go, that a tablet cannot do.

1048
01:02:10,982 --> 01:02:11,320
Rym: Here's what I do.

1049
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:13,098
Rym: One, typing a whole bunch of shit.

1050
01:02:13,883 --> 01:02:14,859
Rym: That's what I use my laptop for.

1051
01:02:15,321 --> 01:02:17,319
Rym: Two, actually editing video.

1052
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:22,679
Scott: I can actually... I have Premiere on my iPad, if I just need to get the iPad that has more storage space.

1053
01:02:23,721 --> 01:02:24,474
Scott: I don't even need...

1054
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:25,980
Rym: Three, PlaySieve 5.

1055
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:30,079
Scott: I don't even need the laptop to do presentations because I bought the iPad to HDMI cable.

1056
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:30,622
Rym: Yeah.

1057
01:02:30,967 --> 01:02:31,900
Rym: Will that work with VGA?

1058
01:02:32,723 --> 01:02:34,959
Scott: No, but if there is a VGA, then I have a laptop.

1059
01:02:35,421 --> 01:02:37,120
Scott: But there's no reason for me to get a new laptop.

1060
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:40,980
Scott: This one is going to be just fine for pretty much ever.

1061
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:45,540
Scott: And if I need to play a fancy game on it, which I never ever do, I can Steam stream.

1062
01:02:46,542 --> 01:02:47,954
Rym: Well, you can't Steam stream on a plane.

1063
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:50,160
Scott: But I can Steam stream in my bed.

1064
01:02:50,501 --> 01:02:51,158
Rym: Yeah, that's true.

1065
01:02:52,523 --> 01:02:54,000
Scott: And I wouldn't want to Steam stream on a plane.

1066
01:02:54,940 --> 01:02:56,219
Scott: I would not Steam stream on a plane.

1067
01:02:56,460 --> 01:02:58,155
Scott: I would not Steam stream in the rain.

1068
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:02,059
Scott: Because then my laptop would go in the wetness.

1069
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:04,058
Rym: I think we're done here.

1070
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:11,340
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1071
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:16,480
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1072
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:21,880
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1073
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:24,800
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1074
01:03:25,081 --> 01:03:29,539
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1075

1076
01:03:34,323 --> 01:03:37,380
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1077
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:40,500
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
