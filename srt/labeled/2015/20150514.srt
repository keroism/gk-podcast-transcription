1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,216
Rym: It's Thursday, May 14th, 2015.

2
00:00:10,216 --> 00:00:10,498
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,812 --> 00:00:14,529
Scott: I am Scott.

4
00:00:14,751 --> 00:00:16,248
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:18,109
Rym: The fuck are we talking about tonight?

6
00:00:21,701 --> 00:00:22,719
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:35,890
Rym: So, uh, biking home today, I was gonna have a bunch of anecdotes about how for whatever reason today must have been, like, shithead biker day.

8
00:00:36,371 --> 00:00:38,070
Rym: Like, I bumped into more people on bicycles.

9
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:43,370
Scott: Yesterday was bike to work day, that Wednesday, and I think it's bike to work month also?

10
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:44,272
Rym: Oh!

11
00:00:44,293 --> 00:00:44,335
Rym: Oh!

12
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:50,650
Rym: 'Cause yesterday a whole bunch of shitheads had set up these tents, like, blocking the bike lane, giving away free shit.

13
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:52,570
Rym: And it really got in my way.

14
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,070
Scott: That's transportation alternatives doing their thing.

15
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:56,261
Scott: They do that every year.

16
00:00:56,302 --> 00:00:56,970
Scott: You haven't noticed?

17
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:57,787
Rym: You know what?

18
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,230
Scott: I think they do it multiple times a year.

19
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:00,839
Rym: Yeah, you know what I probably notice it as?

20
00:01:01,242 --> 00:01:02,690
Rym: Some shitheads are blocking the bike lane.

21
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:03,856
Scott: They've actually upgraded.

22
00:01:04,016 --> 00:01:06,529
Scott: Usually I just pass it by and ignore them.

23
00:01:08,011 --> 00:01:12,650
Scott: But they upgraded, and instead of just having coffee that I don't drink, they had coffee and snacks.

24
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:18,970
Scott: So I actually slowed down for a second to peep the snack, and then saw it was a crappy snack and kept going.

25
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:24,890
Rym: But they had, like, the crowds they formed were blocking multiple bike lanes that I used to go to work.

26
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,510
Rym: So, guys, think this through a little bit better.

27
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:37,850
Rym: But no, so today, I've run into, like, I've never seen so many adults who clearly do not know how bicycles work attempting to ride them in New York.

28
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,949
Rym: And they're almost all on Citi Bikes.

29
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:45,910
Rym: So Scott just informed me right before we did the show that apparently today it was like, "You can ride Citi Bike for free

30
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:46,030
Rym: day!".

31
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,650
Scott: It was actually very interesting.

32
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:54,790
Scott: The reason you could ride Citi Bike for free today was because some Swiss company or whatever sponsored it.

33
00:01:55,031 --> 00:02:00,488
Scott: They basically said, "We'll pick up the tab for everyone getting a free Citi Bike as a means of advertising

34
00:02:00,528 --> 00:02:00,990
Scott: themselves.".

35
00:02:01,111 --> 00:02:04,089
Scott: And I think that's actually cool as a revenue stream for Citi Bike.

36
00:02:04,293 --> 00:02:04,400
Scott: Yeah.

37
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,288
Scott: But, you know, it's like...

38
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,810
Rym: If it's like the Empire State Building where every day is sponsored by...

39
00:02:09,572 --> 00:02:10,419
Scott: Well, I guess sort of.

40
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,450
Scott: But think about it this way, right?

41
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:16,410
Scott: Let's say today they would have had 100 people buy day passes, right?

42
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:18,381
Scott: Okay, that costs X dollars.

43
00:02:18,421 --> 00:02:19,669
Scott: That's how much revenue they bring in.

44
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:26,550
Scott: If day passes are free, because this company is paying for them, a lot more people are going to get day passes.

45
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,910
Rym: I'll just go get bikes and take them to other stations.

46
00:02:29,311 --> 00:02:30,736
Scott: Right, just to ride bikes around.

47
00:02:30,796 --> 00:02:34,470
Scott: But meanwhile, they're still getting paid probably pretty close.

48
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,410
Scott: You know, I can't imagine they would make a deal with too much of a discount, right?

49
00:02:37,851 --> 00:02:40,910
Scott: You know, that company is paying for all these day passes.

50
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,276
Scott: They're not actually giving away for free.

51
00:02:42,317 --> 00:02:44,830
Scott: They're just increasing sales.

52
00:02:45,352 --> 00:02:45,593
Rym: Yep.

53
00:02:45,975 --> 00:02:49,190
Rym: It's interesting, though, because I had no idea that this was going on.

54
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:52,443
Rym: All I knew was shitheads on Citi Bikes who don't know how to ride.

55
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:56,010
Rym: bikes were wobbling around all over the place, going the wrong way in the middle of the street.

56
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:00,770
Scott: I'm sure business people already knew this, but that's a great business idea I never heard of before.

57
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,950
Scott: Where it's like, let's say I sell apples in my fruit store.

58
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,403
Scott: And it's like, you know, apples, 10 cents.

59
00:03:05,444 --> 00:03:06,530
Scott: I'm going to sell X apples.

60
00:03:07,311 --> 00:03:12,190
Scott: If it's free apples, but I'm getting the 10 cents from Rym who said, "I'll pay for everyone's apples today.

61
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,967
Scott: I'm going to sell out of apples and make way more

62
00:03:15,007 --> 00:03:15,268
Scott: money.".

63
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:18,930
Rym: Me paying for all those apples is way cheaper than me buying like an ad.

64
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:22,510
Scott: Well, because what you're doing is you're buying people liking Rym.

65
00:03:23,271 --> 00:03:27,410
Scott: I'm the one profiting from that with my store and everyone else is profiting with the apples.

66
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,389
Scott: It's pretty much like just good all around.

67
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,769
Rym: We're onto something here today.

68
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:31,452
Scott: Yeah.

69
00:03:31,472 --> 00:03:32,949
Scott: So we just need to find...

70
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,714
Rym: So here's the next thing.

71
00:03:34,377 --> 00:03:41,170
Rym: If you want to advertise on the Internet, the way to do it is find a popular website that otherwise has ads.

72
00:03:41,731 --> 00:03:48,848
Rym: And instead, buy the site's ads and put no ads up except a tiny banner that says, "No ads because of

73
00:03:48,969 --> 00:03:49,029
Rym: us.".

74
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:54,304
Scott: Well, I think a better way to do it would be saying, "This game on Steam is free today.

75
00:03:54,404 --> 00:03:55,106
Scott: I'm paying for every

76
00:03:55,126 --> 00:03:55,207
Scott: copy.".

77
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:58,947
Scott: Anyone who downloads this game today on Steam, it's free.

78
00:03:59,047 --> 00:03:59,490
Scott: or Humble Bundle.

79
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,316
Rym: One day only.

80
00:04:00,336 --> 00:04:01,927
Rym: The fabulous Blues Brothers.

81
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:08,150
Scott: Anyone who gets Humble Bundle today pays $0 and you get the whole bundle, the max bundle.

82
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:12,410
Scott: And I will pay the max bundle price for every person that downloads.

83
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:14,869
Rym: Not the worst idea.

84
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:15,763
Rym: Yep.

85
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,702
Scott: So you're promoting those games because they're getting exposure.

86
00:04:19,723 --> 00:04:20,890
Scott: People play them who wouldn't have.

87
00:04:21,051 --> 00:04:22,841
Scott: I'm getting exposure because my name's on it.

88
00:04:23,243 --> 00:04:24,350
Scott: People are getting free games.

89
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:27,950
Scott: And the people who make the games are getting money and I'm just spending money.

90
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:30,250
Scott: But I'm getting exposure that I was paying for in the first place.

91
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:34,387
Rym: Don't do it with City Bike because those people were in my way all day.

92
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:35,050
Rym: It was awful.

93
00:04:35,814 --> 00:04:38,909
Scott: I didn't bike to work today only because I went to El Dentist.

94
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:43,169
Rym: I biked to work like 12 times this year so far.

95
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,119
Scott: The dentist said I was looking great.

96
00:04:45,502 --> 00:04:46,126
Scott: No problems.

97
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:46,850
Scott: My teeth are awesome.

98
00:04:47,031 --> 00:04:47,350
Rym: Not bad.

99
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:47,886
Scott: I bite you.

100
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:50,089
Rym: I don't really want you to bite me.

101
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,299
Scott: But they're so clean right now.

102
00:04:51,339 --> 00:04:52,510
Scott: It's the best time for me to bite you.

103
00:04:52,771 --> 00:04:53,910
Rym: No, I think I'll get them dirty right away.

104
00:04:54,737 --> 00:04:55,230
Scott: Are you filthy?

105
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:56,915
Rym: I just biked here.

106
00:04:56,936 --> 00:04:59,650
Rym: You're going to get a bunch of New York all over your teeth.

107
00:05:02,171 --> 00:05:20,110
Rym: In the news, as I pointed out on Twitter, because we chose not to pay for upgraded infrastructure with money, we're now paying for our lack of upgrades with literal human lives because one of the biggest train disasters in recent history happened.

108
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:23,850
Rym: And an Amtrak train basically crashed and killed a ton of people.

109
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,681
Rym: I think they found the eighth dead person so far.

110
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,410
Rym: They're not sure how many people are dead necessarily.

111
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,843
Scott: Why is it so hard to find people?

112
00:05:29,883 --> 00:05:30,690
Scott: Aren't they just all in the train?

113
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,009
Scott: Did you see pictures of the train?

114
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,469
Scott: Yeah, but aren't they just next to the train or under it?

115
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,377
Rym: No, they're like crushed inside of that.

116
00:05:36,397 --> 00:05:38,928
Rym: They've got to cut this thing apart and get inside it.

117
00:05:38,968 --> 00:05:39,330
Rym: Look at that.

118
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,069
Scott: Yeah, that took this many days?

119
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:41,530
Rym: Yeah.

120
00:05:42,514 --> 00:05:42,870
Scott: All right.

121
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:43,609
Rym: Shit's not easy.

122
00:05:44,376 --> 00:05:44,467
Rym: Okay.

123
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:56,230
Rym: So basically this should be a wake-up call, but the reality is already, one, it's a partisan issue, and two, almost no one actually cares.

124
00:05:56,711 --> 00:06:08,467
Rym: The Republicans, funnily enough, they had basically, along with the Democrats, passed this thing a while ago that said, "Amtrak has to put in this fancy system that will prevent accidents exactly like this

125
00:06:08,588 --> 00:06:08,668
Rym: one.".

126
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:17,350
Rym: But they didn't give Amtrak any money to do that, and simultaneously they had been cutting Amtrak's budget constantly.

127
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:22,490
Scott: Isn't there some train-making company that wants to lobby the government?

128
00:06:23,652 --> 00:06:27,030
Rym: I don't think there's a lot of money in the train-making enough to be worth lobbying.

129
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,475
Scott: Trains are worth ... They're so expensive.

130
00:06:29,495 --> 00:06:35,390
Scott: You've got to imagine a train business could profit heavily if they convinced the United States to spend tax dollars on trains.

131
00:06:35,871 --> 00:06:38,009
Rym: The thing is- There's so much space here.

132
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:43,430
Rym: I think the cost of convincing the United States is so high that you could never make a profit.

133
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:49,630
Scott: What if I already have so much money because I'm Google, and then I buy a train company and then lobby?

134
00:06:49,971 --> 00:06:50,833
Rym: That could happen.

135
00:06:51,114 --> 00:06:55,326
Rym: We need a Rockefeller to come and say, "Look, fuckers," and just do it with money.

136
00:06:55,346 --> 00:06:56,750
Rym: That is not going to happen.

137
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:00,890
Rym: I can't let Bill Gates and Sergey Brin and Musk all get together.

138
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,199
Scott: Because they're car people.

139
00:07:02,239 --> 00:07:03,430
Scott: You know how many cars Bill Gates has?

140
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:05,330
Rym: Yeah, but how many of them does he drive?

141
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:09,090
Scott: He's always driving one Porsche or whatever.

142
00:07:09,692 --> 00:07:16,850
Rym: The funniest thing about this, and also the saddest thing, basically the Republicans sense danger immediately.

143
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,356
Rym: They were like, "Don't make this an infrastructure issue.

144
00:07:20,396 --> 00:07:28,230
Rym: Don't bring up the fact that we cut Amtrak's budget literally yesterday because no amount of infrastructure upgrades could have prevented this.

145
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,855
Rym: This is clearly human error.

146
00:07:30,076 --> 00:07:31,321
Rym: That train was going too fast.

147
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,348
Rym: The speed is literally the only thing that

148
00:07:33,388 --> 00:07:33,750
Rym: matters.".

149
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:39,126
Scott: Yes, but neglecting to mention the fact that the train was going 100 something miles an hour, right?

150
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:44,500
Scott: Don't bring up the fact that trains in other countries go 200, 300 miles an hour.

151
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,330
Scott: perfectly fine with no issues and no one would complain about that.

152
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:57,890
Rym: Or never mind the fact that it just so happens that that thing that the government said Amtrak has to deploy but also gave them no money to deploy and then cut their budget even further.

153
00:07:58,151 --> 00:08:00,190
Scott: It would cost as much as getting better trains?

154
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,573
Rym: It wouldn't have cost that much at all.

155
00:08:01,654 --> 00:08:02,556
Rym: In fact, it's pretty cheap.

156
00:08:02,877 --> 00:08:07,970
Rym: Amtrak had deployed it in as many places as they could possibly afford with their pitiful budget.

157
00:08:08,612 --> 00:08:12,770
Rym: But they couldn't deploy it everywhere because Congress and mostly the Republicans won't give them any money.

158
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:17,887
Rym: That thing a bunch of engineers came out and said would literally 100% have prevented this issue.

159
00:08:19,594 --> 00:08:21,789
Rym: It is designed to prevent this issue.

160
00:08:22,359 --> 00:08:22,610
Scott: Okay.

161
00:08:23,531 --> 00:08:25,000
Rym: And it wasn't even that expensive.

162
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,870
Rym: It's just like Amtrak has no money.

163
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:30,130
Scott: If they would have given them money, it would have been deployed and these people wouldn't have died.

164
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:37,070
Rym: Yes, so the Republicans basically caused these people's deaths because it's a partisan issue whether or not to fund Amtrak.

165
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:43,809
Rym: Also, for people who don't live in America, you should probably realize that Amtrak is like our big train network.

166
00:08:44,671 --> 00:08:51,470
Rym: The only profitable part of it is the area around New York and literally no other part of it matters and operates at a huge loss.

167
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:54,138
Scott: But you can ride this train everywhere.

168
00:08:54,258 --> 00:08:57,207
Scott: It goes all the way to Seattle, to Chicago, to L.A.

169
00:08:58,311 --> 00:09:01,009
Scott: You can ride this train across the whole goddamn country.

170
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,982
Rym: You can pay and attach your own train cars to these trains.

171
00:09:04,022 --> 00:09:05,950
Rym: You can get little cabins in these trains.

172
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,941
Scott: You can take the, I don't know if you can still do it.

173
00:09:08,961 --> 00:09:11,110
Scott: There used to be, we took it once, the auto train.

174
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,795
Scott: You would drive to Virginia.

175
00:09:13,137 --> 00:09:16,347
Scott: You would put your car on the train in the back.

176
00:09:17,712 --> 00:09:21,190
Scott: You would go sit in the front where there's all the dining car and all that kind of stuff.

177
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:29,390
Scott: And the train would take you basically overnight to Florida and then you would get off and then they'd bring your car around.

178
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:32,290
Scott: And you'd get in it and you'd be in Florida and you just didn't have to drive.

179
00:09:33,251 --> 00:09:34,235
Scott: And you didn't have to rent a car.

180
00:09:34,255 --> 00:09:35,098
Scott: You didn't have to fly.

181
00:09:35,599 --> 00:09:37,286
Scott: And it took basically overnight.

182
00:09:37,306 --> 00:09:38,450
Scott: You sleep on the train once.

183
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:45,350
Scott: You get there in the morning, get on the train, spend all day on the train, go to bed, wake up, get off the train sometime during the next day.

184
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:51,370
Rym: Well, that second Anime Central that I went to, I drove to Rochester from Beacon, well from Fishkill.

185
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:54,362
Rym: And then I got on an Amtrak with like Scojo and some friends.

186
00:09:54,402 --> 00:09:55,930
Rym: Then I took the Amtrak to Chicago from there.

187
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:56,410
Scott: Right.

188
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:03,050
Scott: And that's the thing is all these fancy trains in other countries, much like the internet in other countries, it doesn't have to go very far.

189
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:08,710
Rym: But also it's subsidized by the government and there's a lot of investment in that infrastructure.

190
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:18,450
Rym: In the US, Congress gives Amtrak basically no money and they force them to run very, very unprofitable routes that a handful of people use.

191
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:21,830
Scott: Well, if you turn those routes off, those few people, what the fuck are they going to do?

192
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:22,772
Rym: You know what?

193
00:10:22,792 --> 00:10:23,394
Rym: A bus.

194
00:10:24,055 --> 00:10:29,930
Rym: Replace all the Amtrak in those dumpy little towns with a bus that goes to a bigger Amtrak station somewhere.

195
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,016
Rym: I think that's what we should do.

196
00:10:32,036 --> 00:10:35,050
Rym: Or if Amtrak has this mandate to cover the whole country.

197
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:36,812
Rym: They, yeah.

198
00:10:38,336 --> 00:10:39,920
Rym: I'm not saying Amtrak's that unsafe yet.

199
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,790
Rym: I'm just saying that they should either fund it enough to cover that mandate or drop the mandate.

200
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:49,350
Scott: Like I knew some people who wanted to go to Minnesota for the Netrunner World Championship, which I would never go to in Minnesota.

201
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,690
Rym: I would fly and rent a car.

202
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:51,372
Scott: Obviously.

203
00:10:51,432 --> 00:10:52,336
Scott: That's what I would do too.

204
00:10:52,437 --> 00:10:55,210
Scott: But they were the kind of people who were afraid of flying.

205
00:10:56,051 --> 00:10:56,474
Scott: What?

206
00:10:56,495 --> 00:10:57,562
Rym: Don't go to Minnesota.

207
00:10:57,582 --> 00:10:58,610
Rym: There's no way to get there.

208
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:01,448
Scott: They took Amtrak to Minnesota and they made it.

209
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:03,389
Scott: How long did that take?

210
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:03,974
Scott: I don't know.

211
00:11:04,054 --> 00:11:06,389
Scott: They played Netrunner on the train the whole way there.

212
00:11:07,231 --> 00:11:08,736
Scott: And I'm just like, all right.

213
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:13,070
Scott: But if they didn't have Amtrak, they would have had to deal with their fear of flying.

214
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,201
Scott: Or drive, which would have been way worse.

215
00:11:15,261 --> 00:11:16,590
Scott: Or bus, which would have been way worse.

216
00:11:17,535 --> 00:11:17,656
Rym: Yup.

217
00:11:17,696 --> 00:11:18,584
Rym: Buses are pretty awful.

218
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:20,949
Scott: But Amtrak totally lost money bringing them there.

219
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:21,521
Rym: Yup.

220
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:23,581
Scott: How many people were on that train?

221
00:11:23,601 --> 00:11:24,470
Scott: I can't imagine a lot.

222
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:28,786
Rym: And meanwhile, America has this weird obsession with making mass transit.

223
00:11:28,826 --> 00:11:29,730
Rym: They treat it like a business.

224
00:11:29,951 --> 00:11:31,117
Rym: It has to be profitable.

225
00:11:31,478 --> 00:11:32,624
Rym: It has to make profits.

226
00:11:32,664 --> 00:11:33,810
Rym: It has to self-fund.

227
00:11:35,232 --> 00:11:36,849
Rym: But roads don't have to self-fund.

228
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,370
Rym: Roads get funded by the government.

229
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:39,902
Scott: Yup.

230
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:43,409
Rym: And somehow they don't see how utterly fucked up that is.

231
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:46,950
Scott: Well, because I think it's a matter of not understanding the cause and effect.

232
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:49,770
Scott: It's like, people drive, therefore we need to fund roads.

233
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:53,030
Scott: And it's like, actually, people are driving because you fund roads.

234
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:58,470
Scott: If you funded trains and stopped funding roads, people would stop driving and they would take the train more.

235
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:01,281
Rym: Or like Midwestern people, like, oh, buses are for poor people.

236
00:12:01,301 --> 00:12:03,610
Rym: It's like, yeah, that's because buses are cheap and they suck.

237
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:07,530
Rym: That's why you would get this impression that only poor people ride them.

238
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:13,490
Scott: If you paid money to make fancy buses, poor people would stop using them and rich people would use them.

239
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:13,712
Rym: Yup.

240
00:12:13,752 --> 00:12:15,169
Rym: Look at Google with their private buses.

241
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:19,910
Scott: Whatever you spend the money on, basically it's not give money to what people use.

242
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,789
Scott: It's give money and people will use the thing you give money to.

243
00:12:23,331 --> 00:12:24,390
Rym: Or maybe, just maybe.

244
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:25,742
Scott: You tell the people where to go.

245
00:12:25,783 --> 00:12:26,530
Scott: They don't tell you where.

246
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:32,050
Rym: Just maybe, connecting all the wide spaces in America with trains is stupid.

247
00:12:32,911 --> 00:12:36,730
Rym: Maybe we should just use bullet trains to connect all the major cities on the two coasts.

248
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:41,209
Rym: I mean, flying to Boston is a ridiculous waste.

249
00:12:41,977 --> 00:12:42,189
Rym: Yeah.

250
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:46,370
Rym: Because a bullet train would literally get you there faster than flying.

251
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:57,430
Rym: And in fact, if you account for the TSA security bullshit and getting to and from the airport, it's actually faster to take our existing shitty Amtrak Zelle to Boston than it is to fly there.

252
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:00,350
Scott: You don't think they would put the TSA security on the fancy bullet train?

253
00:13:00,611 --> 00:13:01,648
Rym: They haven't so far.

254
00:13:02,671 --> 00:13:03,969
Scott: On the fancy bullet train, though.

255
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:04,373
Scott: Yeah.

256
00:13:04,393 --> 00:13:05,750
Rym: At the same time, they also shouldn't...

257
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,480
Scott: They would be like, this is a target for terrorism.

258
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,566
Scott: We spent so much money on this.

259
00:13:08,586 --> 00:13:09,250
Scott: This is so fancy.

260
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,054
Rym: I'm going to put it this way.

261
00:13:10,336 --> 00:13:16,390
Rym: If America was smart enough to make a bullet train, by that point, they were already smart enough to get rid of the TSA.

262
00:13:16,775 --> 00:13:17,050
Rym: Alright.

263
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:24,790
Rym: There is no world I can envision where bullet train happens and TSA still exists in the same political climate.

264
00:13:26,131 --> 00:13:28,003
Scott: So, something good that is being built.

265
00:13:28,747 --> 00:13:29,170
Scott: My news.

266
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:30,876
Scott: The most important thing.

267
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,230
Scott: The most important news of the entire week, month, year.

268
00:13:33,491 --> 00:13:34,709
Rym: Oh, I know what you're talking about.

269
00:13:35,211 --> 00:13:36,456
Scott: In Brooklyn, New York.

270
00:13:37,018 --> 00:13:38,063
Scott: A place that we don't live.

271
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,670
Scott: It's actually slightly far away.

272
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:42,230
Rym: Well, I live on the border of Brooklyn.

273
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:42,718
Rym: Sure.

274
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,169
Scott: Whatever.

275
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:45,030
Rym: I live in Brooklyn.

276
00:13:45,513 --> 00:13:48,669
Scott: They're going to build a Wegman.

277
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:49,393
Rym: Ah, yes.

278
00:13:49,434 --> 00:13:50,230
Rym: Motherfucking Wegmans.

279
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,477
Scott: The most important thing.

280
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,590
Scott: The real deal.

281
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:57,409
Scott: The greatest grocery store to exist other than Stu Leonard's.

282
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:00,230
Rym: So, you listeners, you've known us long enough to know...

283
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:03,690
Scott: I mean, a lot of you people probably live in suburbs and just have big supermarkets.

284
00:14:04,095 --> 00:14:04,270
Scott: Yeah.

285
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:07,629
Scott: A lot of you people maybe live in cities and know what the deal is.

286
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:11,190
Scott: Maybe you live in other countries where groceries are totally different than they are here.

287
00:14:11,371 --> 00:14:13,310
Rym: Yeah, like even here, like in New York, I get Fresh Direct.

288
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:13,853
Rym: You know what?

289
00:14:13,954 --> 00:14:15,044
Rym: I like Fresh Direct a lot.

290
00:14:15,064 --> 00:14:15,730
Rym: I don't go grocery stores.

291
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,779
Scott: Yeah, maybe you get shit delivered.

292
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:17,143
Scott: I don't know.

293
00:14:17,183 --> 00:14:17,930
Scott: Maybe you just eat out.

294
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:19,824
Scott: Maybe you eat from your own farm.

295
00:14:19,864 --> 00:14:20,430
Scott: I don't fucking know.

296
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:22,109
Rym: But I can put this really succinctly.

297
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:27,050
Scott: Wegman is, other than Stu Leonard's, the grocery store of grocery stores.

298
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:27,553
Rym: You know us.

299
00:14:27,795 --> 00:14:30,110
Rym: We are jaded as shit about everything.

300
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:35,330
Rym: When we leave New York City to go to a convention, it's nothing but Scott bitching about it.

301
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:36,639
Rym: Everything's not as good as New York.

302
00:14:37,062 --> 00:14:38,170
Rym: Nothing impresses us.

303
00:14:38,492 --> 00:14:41,310
Rym: Every time we go to, we're like, wow, there's nothing to do here.

304
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:42,270
Rym: We ate at all the restaurants.

305
00:14:43,652 --> 00:14:49,989
Rym: We did a whole episode reviewing the city of San Antonio, one of the biggest cities in America, and how boring and tiny it is.

306
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:58,789
Rym: And yet, when we are near a Wegmans, like we travel somewhere, we'll go to it like we're going to an amusement park.

307
00:15:00,591 --> 00:15:08,229
Scott: Most of the Wegmans are so big, and they have every food imaginable, and the food quality is so high, and the price is average.

308
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:15,690
Scott: But they're like, not only that, but not even for the customer, how amazing a place it is for the employees.

309
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,990
Scott: It's always number one place to work, Wegman.

310
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,457
Rym: Yeah, they're super ethical.

311
00:15:19,477 --> 00:15:21,370
Rym: They pay their employees real living wages.

312
00:15:21,811 --> 00:15:23,770
Rym: Everything about this place is great.

313
00:15:25,031 --> 00:15:27,250
Scott: And they're going to finally build one in New York City.

314
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:29,210
Rym: Now, there's a real important question.

315
00:15:30,492 --> 00:15:33,930
Scott: How much does it cost to rent an apartment near where this place is going to be?

316
00:15:34,293 --> 00:15:36,030
Rym: About as much as it costs to rent right here.

317
00:15:36,611 --> 00:15:37,961
Scott: Well, it's time to move then.

318
00:15:37,981 --> 00:15:39,270
Scott: I've got to be within walking distance.

319
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:42,303
Rym: It's in that green pointy, that sort of rising area.

320
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:51,329
Rym: So it's in a hot area, but it's in a hot area that's furthest away from the hottest areas, and it has basically no subway access.

321
00:15:51,997 --> 00:15:52,549
Scott: How do I get to work?

322
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:57,530
Rym: You could walk to the G, and then take that to further Brooklyn.

323
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,789
Scott: Is there a water taxi there?

324
00:16:02,434 --> 00:16:03,485
Rym: I'll bet there will be.

325
00:16:04,633 --> 00:16:09,510
Scott: I could take the water taxi over the East River in the winter, and then take across town something.

326
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,770
Rym: Well, in the summer, I would just bike over the Queensborough Bridge.

327
00:16:13,694 --> 00:16:14,281
Scott: Obviously.

328
00:16:14,362 --> 00:16:14,970
Scott: I'm talking about the winter.

329
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:18,429
Rym: Well, if you were living down there, you would want to bike up through Brooklyn and bike over the Queensborough Bridge.

330
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:19,058
Scott: Sure.

331
00:16:19,811 --> 00:16:23,799
Rym: Anyway, so there's a big question that we didn't think about, because there's one thing left.

332
00:16:25,512 --> 00:16:28,855
Scott: It's only going to be 25% smaller than a regular Wegman, so only 75% the size.

333
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:29,278
Scott: I'll take it.

334
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:36,127
Rym: There is one thing left now that New York City lacks, other than a rollercoaster park.

335
00:16:36,168 --> 00:16:36,350
Rym: Dibella's?

336
00:16:36,534 --> 00:16:37,208
Rym: Yeah, Dibella's.

337
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:39,150
Scott: But Wegman's has sort of a Dibella's in it.

338
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:40,206
Rym: So that's what I'm getting at.

339
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:48,290
Rym: Will the deli counter at this Wegman's have the 90% as good as Dibella's subs?

340
00:16:49,433 --> 00:16:50,630
Scott: I can't see why it wouldn't.

341
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:54,968
Rym: If it does, I don't know what I'm going to do, other than eat there.

342
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:56,610
Scott: Bike down there and get a sandwich.

343
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,788
Rym: Stop there every day on my way home.

344
00:16:59,091 --> 00:17:01,130
Scott: Bike over, grab a sandwich, go to the park.

345
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,790
Rym: Bike over there for lunch from my office.

346
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:05,905
Scott: Eat the sandwich, go back home with a backup sandwich.

347
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:11,930
Rym: We have detoured dozens of miles out of our way to go to Dibella's on trips to other places.

348
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:13,028
Scott: Why wouldn't you?

349
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:17,890
Rym: If you're stupid, if you're gluten intolerant, there's that.

350
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,848
Scott: I should buy a bodega around here.

351
00:17:20,752 --> 00:17:21,930
Rym: And just copy the Wegman's formula?

352
00:17:22,131 --> 00:17:23,069
Scott: No, and make it a Wawa.

353
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:30,270
Rym: While we lack Wawa, I think we make up for that with our combination of bodegas and street food.

354
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,310
Scott: But imagine if one of the bodegas was just a Wawa.

355
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,510
Scott: It had a Wawa brand on the outside.

356
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:35,410
Rym: You know what I just imagined?

357
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:39,490
Rym: If that weird gas station right next to our apartment, like the studio right here.

358
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,350
Scott: Yeah, that's a good example.

359
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:41,450
Rym: If that was a Wawa.

360
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:42,787
Scott: Right, there's no reason it can't be.

361
00:17:44,176 --> 00:17:44,748
Scott: Why couldn't it be?

362
00:17:45,072 --> 00:17:46,168
Rym: There's no reason it shouldn't be.

363
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:46,770
Rym: Right.

364
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,388
Rym: That place would have been a bank too.

365
00:17:49,573 --> 00:17:50,809
Scott: Once those new buildings open up.

366
00:17:51,252 --> 00:17:55,090
Rym: Now, even though that place, all the good restaurants are at least several blocks away.

367
00:17:55,733 --> 00:17:56,530
Rym: That is the place.

368
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,270
Rym: You know what it would do?

369
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,310
Rym: It would kill the deli downstairs in my building.

370
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:02,110
Rym: So, tiny news.

371
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:03,730
Rym: I wouldn't have talked about this.

372
00:18:04,052 --> 00:18:05,549
Rym: I wouldn't even be on our radar.

373
00:18:06,691 --> 00:18:12,670
Rym: Most people I know saw like, oh, they're kind of like how when the government monitors terrorists, they're like, oh, there's chatter.

374
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:14,950
Rym: We don't know what they're talking about, but there's increased chatter.

375
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:20,250
Scott: Yeah, I saw a whole bunch of news on all my feeds talking about Jem and the Holograms.

376
00:18:20,991 --> 00:18:24,850
Scott: And I said, oh, there must be some new Jem and the Holograms thing that people are excited about.

377
00:18:24,991 --> 00:18:26,970
Scott: Okay, I don't really care about Jem and the Holograms.

378
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:29,269
Scott: I've seen maybe like two episodes and I don't care.

379
00:18:29,852 --> 00:18:31,269
Scott: So, I will ignore this.

380
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,710
Rym: Now, one, that's how we stay abreast of stuff on the internet.

381
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:39,470
Rym: By paying, like we know if something's trending, even if we don't know why or care, you at least know like we had the pulse.

382
00:18:39,851 --> 00:18:40,909
Scott: I'm tapped into the feeds.

383
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:42,630
Scott: Something's going on with Jem.

384
00:18:42,651 --> 00:18:43,349
Scott: I know what's going on.

385
00:18:43,451 --> 00:18:44,428
Scott: I know what I need to know.

386
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:53,210
Rym: So, I was in the same boat, but then I saw a tweet from Ben Kachara and he felt the need to have an article on Polygon about this trailer.

387
00:18:53,911 --> 00:18:54,250
Scott: Okay.

388
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:57,190
Rym: So, I was like, all right, that's worth clicking on.

389
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:00,830
Scott: I guess if something's trending, you're going to write an article about it to try to get some hits, right?

390
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:05,070
Rym: So, I clicked on it and the story was kind of fascinating.

391
00:19:05,531 --> 00:19:12,583
Rym: So, I watched the trailer and the first notable thing was that when I watched the trailer, it had like 60 likes and like 2,000 dislikes.

392
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:15,509
Scott: Well, that tells you something.

393
00:19:17,273 --> 00:19:21,150
Scott: By the way, not only are they making Jem and the Holograms, right?

394
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:24,730
Scott: It's a live action Hollywood movie, Jem and the Holograms.

395
00:19:26,012 --> 00:19:33,390
Rym: So, it is a live action Hollywood movie that is called Jem and the Holograms and they are all named after characters in Jem and the Holograms.

396
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:37,530
Rym: There appears to be no magic, no technology, no supercomputer.

397
00:19:37,972 --> 00:19:46,149
Rym: I don't think there's even any misfits and it's basically... Remember that movie with Tom Hanks and younger actor who looks like Tom Hanks?

398
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:47,472
Scott: No.

399
00:19:48,672 --> 00:19:49,189
Rym: Okay, anyway.

400
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:59,890
Rym: This is basically a tween version of that thing you do about a fake YouTube celebrity band becoming famous.

401
00:20:00,513 --> 00:20:00,769
Scott: All right.

402
00:20:01,691 --> 00:20:08,489
Rym: I am amazed and the cool thing is the entire internet realizes how bad this is going to be.

403
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:20,170
Rym: So, what do you do as a studio if you're making your movie and you release your big trailer, your big deal and it gets across the board universally panned even by the people you're trying to target?

404
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:23,110
Scott: You put it out and make your money anyway because even Garfield movies made money?

405
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:27,430
Rym: But Garfield movies, parents will take their kids to see that no matter what.

406
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:28,629
Scott: You think they won't go see this?

407
00:20:29,254 --> 00:20:29,706
Rym: I don't know.

408
00:20:29,971 --> 00:20:33,950
Scott: There are people who like this kind of movie, right?

409
00:20:34,551 --> 00:20:37,710
Scott: Let's say you took the same movie and didn't call it Jem and the Holograms, called it something else.

410
00:20:38,391 --> 00:20:40,657
Scott: I'm sure there's already 30 movies just like that.

411
00:20:41,499 --> 00:20:45,510
Scott: but those people, they will see and like this movie as well.

412
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,177
Scott: They don't care that it's Jem and the Holograms or not.

413
00:20:47,377 --> 00:20:50,390
Scott: and at least some Jem and the Holograms fans will also go see it.

414
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:51,515
Rym: You know who will go see it?

415
00:20:51,595 --> 00:20:53,124
Rym: The people who liked Pitch Perfect.

416
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,058
Scott: I don't know what that is.

417
00:20:56,098 --> 00:20:57,569
Scott: Is that basically the same kind of movie?

418
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:58,957
Rym: The Rockapella group.

419
00:20:58,977 --> 00:21:01,230
Rym: Alright, it made like a hundred million.

420
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:02,153
Scott: That's money.

421
00:21:02,293 --> 00:21:03,641
Scott: I'll take it.

422
00:21:04,365 --> 00:21:05,129
Scott: You can give that to me.

423
00:21:06,773 --> 00:21:10,090
Rym: So then the question is will this movie actually have enough bad momentum to fail?

424
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:18,328
Rym: Or is it getting all this really bad publicity because everyone outside of this very niche specific tween demographic noticed it?

425
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,836
Scott: The only bad publicity it's getting is internet.

426
00:21:20,856 --> 00:21:24,810
Scott: bad publicity because those people who know what the fuck Jem and the Holograms is, other people don't know.

427
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:25,730
Rym: That's what I'm saying.

428
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:27,681
Scott: This will be Jem and the Holograms to them.

429
00:21:27,721 --> 00:21:29,209
Scott: They don't know about the robot and anything.

430
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:36,590
Rym: Yeah, so it's interesting that it's sort of, it's being hated primarily because people who weren't supposed to see it noticed it.

431
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:39,829
Scott: I mean, did you see the video of the kid today at the pay phone who didn't know what the fuck it was?

432
00:21:40,534 --> 00:21:40,822
Rym: Oh yeah.

433
00:21:42,471 --> 00:21:44,644
Scott: Alright, that kid doesn't know what Jem and the Holograms is.

434
00:21:44,704 --> 00:21:45,469
Scott: Maybe he likes this.

435
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:47,011
Scott: I don't know.

436
00:21:47,031 --> 00:21:47,533
Scott: I get the impression.

437
00:21:47,553 --> 00:21:52,570
Scott: If this is his first exposure, people will see this and not even know that it was based on something.

438
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:57,009
Rym: I'm confident this is aimed at 10 to 11 and a half year old girls.

439
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:02,501
Scott: Anyway, if you didn't know, there's a Jem and the Holograms comic.

440
00:22:02,983 --> 00:22:04,670
Scott: There's a lot of comics now that are legit.

441
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:21,722
Scott: There are a lot of comics out now that are based on properties and unlike other mediums when they just base new material on old licensed properties, many, not all, but many of the comics based on properties are good.

442
00:22:21,762 --> 00:22:23,045
Scott: Adventure Time comic is good.

443
00:22:23,065 --> 00:22:24,630
Scott: Brave Azura's comic is good.

444
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:29,760
Scott: There's a lot of good comics based on the stuff that you like anyway.

445
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,468
Scott: So if you like Jem and the Holograms, it's a comic book.

446
00:22:32,488 --> 00:22:33,330
Scott: You can go check that out.

447
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:36,161
Scott: It has all the magic and stuff.

448
00:22:37,246 --> 00:22:38,350
Scott: It's not like this movie.

449
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:43,543
Rym: I mean really, Jem and the Holograms should have been remade a lot like that Equestria Girls thing.

450
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:45,910
Rym: That kind of media was how you remake that.

451
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:47,670
Scott: Oh yeah, because that's so great.

452
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:55,782
Rym: You know, it's not for us, but that is the way you do it because it's basically like it's music driven.

453
00:22:55,843 --> 00:22:56,684
Rym: It's a cartoon.

454
00:22:57,085 --> 00:23:00,250
Rym: It's got all that kind of fantasy stuff that like made Jem what it was.

455
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:01,671
Rym: Whatever.

456
00:23:01,812 --> 00:23:06,405
Rym: This thing is literally, watch the trailer just so you, because you're thinking like how bad could it be?

457
00:23:07,067 --> 00:23:07,850
Rym: It's pretty bad.

458
00:23:09,211 --> 00:23:12,644
Rym: And ignore it after that and don't worry about anything else anyone says about it.

459
00:23:12,684 --> 00:23:14,250
Rym: There's literally no reason to pay further attention.

460
00:23:19,171 --> 00:23:21,295
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

461
00:23:21,976 --> 00:23:25,040
Rym: Our friend Judith showed me this.

462
00:23:26,623 --> 00:23:28,466
Rym: It's kind of an amazing video.

463
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:31,430
Rym: Needs a little bit of discussion.

464
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:35,942
Rym: So this is a video from kind of like public access TV.

465
00:23:35,962 --> 00:23:37,306
Rym: Like I don't know what network it was.

466
00:23:37,326 --> 00:23:38,430
Rym: I'm trying to figure this shit out.

467
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:46,530
Rym: But basically, kind of like PBS, like other networks would do like telethons or fundraisers or auctions and things.

468
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:58,090
Scott: So public television and people are in the only in the United States might know this for old, like us who watch public television when it, you know, so we have a channel, it's PBS and it's public television.

469
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:04,750
Scott: So the government pays for it, but the government doesn't pay for it enough so that they won't survive with just the government's money alone.

470
00:24:05,251 --> 00:24:12,119
Scott: But it also doesn't do commercials and the programs it puts on are usually things like Sesame Street and whatnot.

471
00:24:12,239 --> 00:24:21,530
Scott: that, you know, don't, you know, other educational highbrow content that's not really going to rake in tons of viewers and tons of, you know, money from sponsors and whatnot.

472
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:28,359
Scott: So the money comes from these donation drives where basically they'll go on and they'll have programs.

473
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:37,330
Scott: But in between the programs, they'll stop and talk to people and be like, if you call us on the phone and give us money, we will send you this tote bag and this cookbook.

474
00:24:37,671 --> 00:24:39,496
Scott: And there's all this, it's like, please send us money.

475
00:24:39,596 --> 00:24:44,390
Rym: And when I was a kid, there was a big one that was auctions, like they auctioned stuff off that people had donated.

476
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:49,390
Scott: And we would watch it religiously every year because they would put on really good stuff during this thing.

477
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:50,916
Scott: Like, yeah, my mom, there's a lot of.

478
00:24:51,016 --> 00:24:52,623
Scott: there were a lot of cooking programs on there.

479
00:24:52,643 --> 00:24:54,330
Scott: And this is before the Food Network existed.

480
00:24:54,471 --> 00:24:58,750
Scott: So like you would go see like Jacques Pepin cook something and like he would do the best cooking.

481
00:24:58,990 --> 00:24:59,672
Rym: Oh, no, I'm sorry.

482
00:25:00,494 --> 00:25:01,496
Rym: My mom was bitten up.

483
00:25:01,716 --> 00:25:07,870
Rym: And because one time I wanted to buy something because someone put up just this legit, antique, like awesome phone booth.

484
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,293
Rym: And it wasn't that expensive.

485
00:25:09,513 --> 00:25:09,914
Scott: Oh, wow.

486
00:25:09,934 --> 00:25:10,636
Rym: We were trying to get it.

487
00:25:10,977 --> 00:25:16,650
Rym: And then another time someone was auctioning off like a complete set of Dungeons and Dragons books.

488
00:25:17,151 --> 00:25:18,033
Scott: Why do you have a shiv there?

489
00:25:18,053 --> 00:25:20,158
Rym: This is my Google Glass screwdriver.

490
00:25:20,178 --> 00:25:21,241
Rym: I used it for a task.

491
00:25:21,422 --> 00:25:22,204
Scott: It looks like a shiv.

492
00:25:22,805 --> 00:25:24,650
Rym: This is this is a shiv for like a rat.

493
00:25:24,951 --> 00:25:27,499
Rym: Anyway, maybe a chinchilla could wield this.

494
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:30,610
Scott: So you'd call them up and give them money and they'd send you stuff and you become a member.

495
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:32,717
Scott: And then that money would keep the network going.

496
00:25:32,757 --> 00:25:34,062
Rym: So this is that still works.

497
00:25:34,102 --> 00:25:35,045
Scott: The network is still around.

498
00:25:35,105 --> 00:25:35,506
Rym: This is that.

499
00:25:35,547 --> 00:25:36,990
Rym: This is from 1992.

500
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:38,113
Rym: This was on television.

501
00:25:38,554 --> 00:25:40,899
Rym: The Gallery 33, like art auction thing.

502
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:45,910
Rym: The video is great one, because if you've never seen this style of programing, it is gone.

503
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:47,933
Rym: This is a legacy.

504
00:25:47,993 --> 00:25:51,198
Scott: This is like maybe PBS does still have it, but not like this.

505
00:25:51,478 --> 00:25:59,090
Rym: The cadence, the words people say, the way they talk, their diction, the way they're dressed, their hair.

506
00:25:59,631 --> 00:26:00,874
Rym: This is amazing.

507
00:26:01,014 --> 00:26:04,662
Rym: When people think of the 90s, they're thinking of like the mid to late 90s.

508
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:07,769
Rym: The early 90s were like a bad version of the 80s.

509
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:11,021
Scott: Well, I think it's just, you know, you're thinking about young people 90s.

510
00:26:11,081 --> 00:26:13,189
Scott: You're not thinking about what the old people are doing in the 90s, right?

511
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:14,292
Scott: People think about the 60s.

512
00:26:14,513 --> 00:26:15,938
Scott: They think about what hippies.

513
00:26:16,099 --> 00:26:18,849
Rym: This young guy's dressed in an 80s, like late 80s fashion.

514
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:19,330
Scott: Right.

515
00:26:19,351 --> 00:26:21,620
Scott: I'm just saying like people think about the 60s of the 50s.

516
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,569
Scott: They always think about what young people are up to.

517
00:26:23,629 --> 00:26:23,830
Scott: Right?

518
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:27,196
Scott: Elvis fans, Beatles fans, hippies, right?

519
00:26:27,216 --> 00:26:28,639
Scott: Disco kids, right?

520
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:33,690
Scott: No one thinks defines a generation by what the old people were doing in that era.

521
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:37,442
Scott: Like, you know, 80 year old, 70 year old people in the 70s.

522
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:38,184
Scott: What were they into?

523
00:26:38,345 --> 00:26:39,910
Scott: Still jazz music probably.

524
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:52,710
Rym: So anyway, not to get too down into this, watch this video because this is an art auction and this video is a super cut of one person who donated several pieces to this.

525
00:26:53,911 --> 00:26:55,075
Rym: I think they all got bids.

526
00:26:55,095 --> 00:26:59,830
Rym: Like people bid them up and bought them and it's all furry erotica.

527
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:00,698
Scott: Really?

528
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:02,093
Rym: Uh, yeah.

529
00:27:02,895 --> 00:27:04,559
Rym: That one was I think called surfacing.

530
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:09,090
Rym: The funniest one at the end is called the smell of wet fur.

531
00:27:09,971 --> 00:27:13,165
Rym: And the best part about this video is they're just straight faced.

532
00:27:13,185 --> 00:27:14,210
Scott: They don't think there's a problem with it.

533
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:24,749
Rym: They are a hundred percent straight faced, but a few of them, like one guy starts to talk and he's like, those rats, they look like they're having a good time and let's move on.

534
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:27,695
Rym: This is amazing to behold.

535
00:27:27,715 --> 00:27:28,558
Rym: All right.

536
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,644
Scott: Someone's bidding on the furry erotica.

537
00:27:30,724 --> 00:27:31,607
Rym: It all got sold.

538
00:27:31,627 --> 00:27:32,389
Scott: There you go.

539
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:34,912
Rym: So thank you, Judith.

540
00:27:34,932 --> 00:27:36,775
Rym: The person who showed this to us.

541
00:27:37,356 --> 00:27:45,070
Scott: So speaking of animals with fur in Hong Kong, a place Rym recently went, he apparently did not witness this event though while he was there.

542
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:45,851
Scott: That's a shame.

543
00:27:45,892 --> 00:27:46,393
Scott: That's a shame.

544
00:27:46,413 --> 00:27:55,290
Scott: Uh, somehow a wild boar, I don't even know how wild boar lives on an island like that, uh, got into the store via the ceiling.

545
00:27:55,771 --> 00:27:57,334
Scott: And here's a video of that incident.

546
00:27:57,414 --> 00:27:58,135
Scott: It's hilarious.

547
00:27:58,235 --> 00:27:58,596
Scott: The end.

548
00:27:59,017 --> 00:28:05,750
Rym: There's this great moment where he's on the, uh, like on top of all these shelves and he's got this look of the fuck are you all looking at?

549
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:09,298
Rym: Like he's looking down at all these people and the cops are all just kind of hanging out watching him.

550
00:28:09,338 --> 00:28:14,370
Scott: Like, I'm surprised they had someone who knew how to hug, tie it and take it away properly.

551
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:18,416
Rym: Well, I guess a hog tie is the correct way to deal with that situation.

552
00:28:18,436 --> 00:28:24,185
Scott: Someone who had the proper training knew what to do, you know, just because I know to hog tie it.

553
00:28:24,245 --> 00:28:27,150
Scott: I mean, did they go on YouTube and say how to hog tie wild boar?

554
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,431
Rym: You know who does that?

555
00:28:28,631 --> 00:28:30,133
Rym: At least in the U S animal control.

556
00:28:30,193 --> 00:28:30,714
Rym: My mom.

557
00:28:30,734 --> 00:28:32,576
Rym: That was my mom's job.

558
00:28:32,636 --> 00:28:36,040
Rym: She basically would work with like the police and the anti cruelty.

559
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:44,250
Rym: And like when they go to bust up a dog fighting ring or like deal with an abandoned pet shop or something, she was the one who would come in because she knew how to deal with all the different animals.

560
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:45,672
Scott: All right.

561
00:28:46,453 --> 00:28:51,920
Scott: So in the meantime, the book, Hong Kong's going to call up your mom is still water ship down.

562
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,688
Rym: It's a story about rabbits on an adventure, fighting fascists and cultists and just trying to make a new home.

563
00:28:58,469 --> 00:28:59,070
Rym: You read it yet?

564
00:28:59,854 --> 00:29:01,324
Scott: I haven't read it in a few days.

565
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:03,252
Rym: All right.

566
00:29:03,272 --> 00:29:03,593
Rym: All right.

567
00:29:03,794 --> 00:29:05,520
Rym: Because I'm reading other novels now.

568
00:29:05,962 --> 00:29:08,069
Rym: I've moved on to several other books since then.

569
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:14,370
Scott: If I just keep going on not reading it for longer, it will be a more hilarious and ongoing joke that way.

570
00:29:16,652 --> 00:29:17,436
Rym: I really like that book.

571
00:29:17,456 --> 00:29:18,943
Rym: I don't know why you're not reading it.

572
00:29:19,004 --> 00:29:20,290
Rym: It takes like half a day to read that book.

573
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:23,323
Scott: I'm sure if I actually sat down and read it, it wouldn't take very long.

574
00:29:23,564 --> 00:29:24,990
Scott: Let's do it two weeks.

575
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:25,808
Rym: I'll just say this.

576
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:27,870
Scott: On that Thursday episode, that'll be the end of it.

577
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:31,110
Rym: The longer this goes on, the longer the book I pick is going to be.

578
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:31,832
Scott: We got to pick.

579
00:29:32,033 --> 00:29:33,379
Scott: We got to move on with the book club.

580
00:29:33,399 --> 00:29:36,110
Scott: It's not much of a book club if we just keep talking about it and don't do it.

581
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:40,949
Scott: So I think it's been almost like a ridiculously long time, like perhaps even six months or so.

582
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:41,361
Rym: Yeah.

583
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:44,688
Scott: So two weeks from now, I'll finish it.

584
00:29:45,311 --> 00:29:58,490
Rym: And kind of an aside, if you want to see us perform again at PAX Australia, our third PAX Australia in a row, email us or tweet or something and let us know.

585
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:03,850
Rym: I want to know how many people, for serious, actually really want us to be at PAX Australia.

586
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:13,930
Scott: Is it worth it for me to use my vacation and my monies to go to Australia again when I could just go to someplace with castles or a tropical island or et cetera?

587
00:30:14,433 --> 00:30:16,369
Scott: Not that Australia isn't part tropical island.

588
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:27,342
Rym: It's tough because after I went to the second one, even without Scott, because I've gone to two and the second one was better than PAX South, for real PAX.

589
00:30:27,382 --> 00:30:33,090
Rym: now in a real venue, it's real hard to imagine myself not being at it every year.

590
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:34,994
Rym: There's this momentum.

591
00:30:35,435 --> 00:30:40,290
Rym: But at the same time, even I can't afford to drop like six grand a year.

592
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:41,136
Scott: Even you.

593
00:30:41,821 --> 00:30:42,406
Scott: So wealth.

594
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:42,829
Scott: Wow.

595
00:30:43,151 --> 00:30:48,970
Rym: Yeah, but that is not a trivial expense to fly yourself to Australia.

596
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:51,330
Scott: I mean, for a fraction of the cost, I can go to Europe, right?

597
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:59,510
Rym: Yeah, for the cost of going to PAX Australia and staying there for like the two weeks to make that flight worthwhile, I could spend like a month in Hong Kong.

598
00:31:01,812 --> 00:31:03,082
Scott: What's the exchange rate in Hong Kong?

599
00:31:03,122 --> 00:31:04,110
Scott: Don't they have Hong Kong dollars?

600
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:07,430
Rym: Yeah, it's like 12 Hong Kong dollars to one American dollar.

601
00:31:08,293 --> 00:31:08,817
Rym: Oh, alright.

602
00:31:08,837 --> 00:31:10,228
Scott: But are the prices 12 times higher?

603
00:31:10,751 --> 00:31:11,796
Rym: Yeah, it's something like that.

604
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:12,198
Rym: I don't know.

605
00:31:12,821 --> 00:31:13,946
Rym: I paid for everything in my credit card.

606
00:31:13,966 --> 00:31:14,469
Rym: I don't really care.

607
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:17,358
Scott: Oh, so much money.

608
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:19,330
Scott: You can't afford to go to Australia, but in Hong Kong, I don't even care.

609
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:21,199
Scott: Well, no, my company card.

610
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,184
Rym: I was there on business.

611
00:31:22,244 --> 00:31:23,330
Rym: I didn't spend any of my money.

612
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:23,846
Rym: Oh, okay.

613
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:25,850
Rym: Believe me, I would have known.

614
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:26,888
Scott: You didn't buy any wild boar?

615
00:31:29,331 --> 00:31:29,673
Rym: Oh, shit.

616
00:31:29,994 --> 00:31:30,295
Rym: Oh, yes.

617
00:31:30,336 --> 00:31:31,461
Rym: The crazy thing happened in Hong Kong.

618
00:31:31,481 --> 00:31:32,204
Rym: I forgot to tell you about this.

619
00:31:32,244 --> 00:31:33,389
Rym: So I lost my wild boar.

620
00:31:34,352 --> 00:31:36,370
Scott: Oh, how did you get it into customs?

621
00:31:38,351 --> 00:31:43,470
Rym: So I guess we're doing this show about nuts because people didn't like the other crab people.

622
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:47,089
Scott: People love food shows and there are a lot of different nuts to talk about.

623
00:31:47,412 --> 00:31:47,696
Rym: Yeah.

624
00:31:47,797 --> 00:31:48,650
Scott: Macadamia.

625
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,669
Scott: Might as well start at the top.

626
00:31:51,191 --> 00:31:51,526
Rym: Pistachio.

627
00:31:51,893 --> 00:31:52,390
Scott: That's the top.

628
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,289
Rym: That's the money nut.

629
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:57,710
Scott: So the pistachio nut is the greatest nut that can possibly exist.

630
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:05,290
Scott: If anyone fucking calls, writes, or forums or anything to us talking about what is actually a nut and what is not a nut, you can go fuck yourself.

631
00:32:05,634 --> 00:32:07,110
Scott: Yeah, we've been down that road.

632
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:09,844
Scott: A pistachio nut is called a pistachio nut colloquially.

633
00:32:09,904 --> 00:32:10,930
Scott: Therefore, it's a nut.

634
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:15,190
Scott: If you try to tell me like a peanut's not a nut or I don't even know what's a nut and what's not, but I know.

635
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:17,903
Scott: Someone is going to come up to us and be like a cashew.

636
00:32:17,924 --> 00:32:18,730
Scott: nut's not a nut.

637
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:20,810
Rym: Scott, sometimes you feel like a nut.

638
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:21,330
Scott: A pecan is not a nut.

639
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,030
Rym: Sometimes you don't.

640
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:23,794
Scott: They're all nuts.

641
00:32:23,854 --> 00:32:25,465
Scott: If the word nut's in the name, it's a nut.

642
00:32:25,726 --> 00:32:26,290
Scott: Go fuck yourself.

643
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:26,731
Scott: All right.

644
00:32:26,751 --> 00:32:29,450
Scott: So pistachio nut is the greatest nut, which is why.

645
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:30,212
Rym: Oh, it is a nut.

646
00:32:30,313 --> 00:32:30,976
Rym: It isn't for real.

647
00:32:31,076 --> 00:32:34,190
Rym: This article is about the culinary nut and the tree that bears it.

648
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:34,653
Scott: All right, fine.

649
00:32:34,673 --> 00:32:36,609
Scott: The pistachio nut has a protective shell.

650
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:39,510
Scott: The protective shell is the most important part of the pistachio nut.

651
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:42,090
Scott: That protective shell keeps you from dying.

652
00:32:43,131 --> 00:32:51,990
Scott: If you get already shelled pistachios, a human being cannot physically prevent themselves from just eating all of them and then they're dead.

653
00:32:52,611 --> 00:32:53,454
Rym: This happened to me.

654
00:32:53,474 --> 00:32:54,317
Rym: I didn't die.

655
00:32:54,678 --> 00:32:57,750
Rym: But the first time I went to Turkey, I went to like a bar.

656
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:04,270
Rym: I was having a drink and they brought out like a big tray with a bunch of nuts, like big bowls of nuts just for the bar thing.

657
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:05,474
Rym: So I'm sitting there.

658
00:33:05,816 --> 00:33:06,259
Rym: I'm looking.

659
00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:07,486
Rym: There's one nut I don't recognize.

660
00:33:07,507 --> 00:33:08,010
Rym: Like, what's that?

661
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:11,380
Rym: And it was just a bunch of pistachios outside of their shells.

662
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,190
Rym: because I just, you don't see a bowl of shelled pistachios.

663
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:16,270
Scott: Well, you do if you pay a zillion dollars for them.

664
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:16,486
Scott: Yeah.

665
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:21,370
Scott: But meanwhile, in other countries where they actually have these things growing, they're cheap and plentiful.

666
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:22,650
Rym: The next thing I knew.

667
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:24,449
Scott: In the United States, they are expensive and rare.

668
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:27,269
Rym: I had eaten every single one of them.

669
00:33:28,016 --> 00:33:29,570
Rym: And I had a stomach ache.

670
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:35,270
Scott: If I go to the grocery store and they have pistachio nuts, they're charging like eight bucks for a tiny bag.

671
00:33:35,498 --> 00:33:35,730
Rym: Yeah.

672
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:38,160
Scott: They are expensive and there is a reason.

673
00:33:38,181 --> 00:33:39,627
Scott: It's because they come from far away.

674
00:33:39,667 --> 00:33:40,370
Scott: That's why they're expensive.

675
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:42,089
Rym: So who do you think makes the most pistachios?

676
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:43,568
Rym: Which countries?

677
00:33:44,631 --> 00:33:45,389
Scott: I mean, it's not Turkey?

678
00:33:45,911 --> 00:33:47,049
Rym: Turkey is not number one.

679
00:33:47,451 --> 00:33:47,773
Scott: All right.

680
00:33:47,793 --> 00:33:49,990
Scott: It has to be in that same latitude generally.

681
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:50,908
Rym: You'd think that.

682
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:55,263
Scott: I don't know.

683
00:33:55,344 --> 00:33:55,870
Scott: Maybe the same.

684
00:33:56,956 --> 00:33:57,630
Scott: Yeah, that makes sense.

685
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:58,645
Scott: Number two is the US.

686
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:00,910
Scott: I mean, we're just big, right?

687
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:02,750
Scott: Number three is the most of a lot of things.

688
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:10,130
Rym: Number three is Turkey, then China, Syria, Greece, Italy, Afghanistan, Australia, and Tunisia.

689
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:12,570
Scott: Greece got a lot of pistachios for a tiny place.

690
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:15,050
Scott: They got like an island of pistachio or something?

691
00:34:16,271 --> 00:34:23,569
Rym: Though what's interesting is you look at the yields and the United States has like three times the yields per hectare.

692
00:34:25,072 --> 00:34:30,989
Rym: Like an equivalent sized pistachio farm in the US makes three times more pistachios than Iran does.

693
00:34:31,931 --> 00:34:33,170
Scott: We have better farm technologies.

694
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:34,156
Rym: Harvesting.

695
00:34:34,216 --> 00:34:35,309
Rym: Ooh, I'm learning about droops.

696
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:36,219
Scott: Uh-oh.

697
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:38,009
Rym: I guess they're droops and they're not nuts.

698
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:40,966
Scott: See, this is the shit I was saying we're not going to talk about.

699
00:34:41,027 --> 00:34:41,389
Scott: Fuck that.

700
00:34:41,811 --> 00:34:42,489
Rym: Hollom and dry.

701
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:43,213
Scott: It's called a nut.

702
00:34:43,253 --> 00:34:43,735
Scott: It's a nut.

703
00:34:43,996 --> 00:34:47,310
Scott: Anyone who says otherwise, I'm going to get Rym shiv and come after you.

704
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:51,264
Rym: So I learned something very important because I like pistachios.

705
00:34:51,284 --> 00:34:52,670
Rym: Like we've gotten this out of the way.

706
00:34:52,811 --> 00:34:56,650
Rym: But I also like Turkish Delight.

707
00:34:57,531 --> 00:34:59,169
Scott: Turkish Delight has pistachios in it.

708
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,730
Rym: Yes, and all those like candies.

709
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:04,690
Scott: Pistachio flavored ice creams, pistachio flavored anything.

710
00:35:05,418 --> 00:35:05,485
Rym: Yup.

711
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:09,890
Scott: So the thing about the pistachio nut is that you get the saltiness of say the baseball park peanut.

712
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:16,470
Scott: But you also get sort of like this oily fatty tissue part, sort of like an avocado.

713
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:23,610
Scott: It's almost like a peanut and an avocado got it on and then protected themselves in a shell because they were too delicious for the world.

714
00:35:25,912 --> 00:35:29,150
Rym: So pistachio baklava was my favorite.

715
00:35:29,452 --> 00:35:30,088
Scott: That's pretty great.

716
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:33,743
Rym: Until I went to Turkey where they have pistachios.

717
00:35:34,406 --> 00:35:35,390
Rym: You can just get pistachios.

718
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:38,109
Scott: Were those pistachios better or different than the ones we had here?

719
00:35:38,671 --> 00:35:39,169
Rym: Way better.

720
00:35:40,253 --> 00:35:41,950
Rym: The cheap ones were just amazing.

721
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:44,463
Rym: Also, they just toast some of them like peanuts.

722
00:35:44,483 --> 00:35:45,770
Rym: Those get toasted salted ones.

723
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:53,970
Scott: Yeah, see when you don't have a thing that's plentiful and it's too expensive, you often don't want to like, you know, variation on it too much, right?

724
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:56,950
Scott: So if you only got so many of these, don't fuck them up by roasting them or some shit.

725
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:57,409
Scott: Yup.

726
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:00,490
Scott: Right, but when you've got tons of them, it's like we got tons of apples, man.

727
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:06,010
Scott: We got apple pie, apple cake, apple fritter, apple everything because we got so many of the damn things.

728
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:07,650
Scott: We got a hundred varieties and whatever.

729
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:09,109
Rym: Thanks Johnny Appleseed.

730
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:15,690
Scott: You know, grapes, we got 10 billion wines, 10 billion grape varieties, but pistachios, all we got is pistachio nut in a bag.

731
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:16,038
Scott: Yup.

732
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:16,605
Scott: That's it.

733
00:36:17,371 --> 00:36:21,849
Rym: And we don't think about like, "Ooh, does this come from the good trees with the thin shells or is the shitty trees with the thin

734
00:36:21,869 --> 00:36:21,990
Rym: shells?"?

735
00:36:22,251 --> 00:36:23,958
Rym: I got a Macoon pistachio.

736
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:25,364
Scott: I got a Honeycrisp pistachio.

737
00:36:25,605 --> 00:36:26,649
Scott: It's like we don't do that shit.

738
00:36:26,729 --> 00:36:26,950
Scott: All right.

739
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:34,586
Rym: So I'm at this dinner and I go to order some pistachio baklava and my business partner is like, "Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

740
00:36:35,188 --> 00:36:35,428
Rym: That's a...".

741
00:36:37,313 --> 00:36:38,430
Scott: That is a tourist move.

742
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,285
Rym: He basically said the equivalent of, "That's a noob's

743
00:36:40,305 --> 00:36:40,648
Rym: mistake.".

744
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:41,990
Scott: A noob's mistake?

745
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:42,531
Rym: Yes.

746
00:36:42,712 --> 00:36:44,541
Rym: It's like, "You're a baklava amateur.

747
00:36:45,565 --> 00:36:46,349
Rym: Get the walnut

748
00:36:46,389 --> 00:36:46,570
Rym: baklava.".

749
00:36:47,531 --> 00:36:48,817
Scott: I like walnuts.

750
00:36:49,078 --> 00:36:50,706
Scott: Walnuts are nut number two.

751
00:36:50,766 --> 00:36:51,530
Scott: There is no question.

752
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:52,674
Rym: So I asked him like, "Why?

753
00:36:52,895 --> 00:36:53,720
Rym: Why the walnut?

754
00:36:53,941 --> 00:36:54,785
Rym: Why does that make a better

755
00:36:54,805 --> 00:36:55,267
Rym: baklava?".

756
00:36:55,910 --> 00:37:03,410
Rym: And lo did he tell me over about 15 minutes why walnut is a superior nut for baklava.

757
00:37:03,911 --> 00:37:11,790
Rym: And it comes down to that baklava is sweeter and lighter and you can eat more of it before you feel sick.

758
00:37:12,251 --> 00:37:19,370
Scott: So the walnut, even though pistachio is the best nut, when I'm baking anything and perhaps I've never baked a baklava, but I'm sure that would be all right.

759
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:23,025
Scott: A walnut is always the go-to nut for baking anything.

760
00:37:23,085 --> 00:37:24,170
Scott: It goes in the chocolate chip cookie.

761
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:25,148
Rym: A walnut is a nut.

762
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:26,573
Scott: It goes in the banana bread.

763
00:37:26,834 --> 00:37:28,579
Scott: It goes in just a fucking salad.

764
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:32,290
Scott: Just take a salad, crunch up some walnuts and chuck it in there.

765
00:37:32,692 --> 00:37:33,838
Rym: I put nuts in my salads.

766
00:37:33,979 --> 00:37:35,950
Rym: Like almost every salad I make, I put nuts in.

767
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:48,930
Scott: A lot of times, like when I'll go buy salads for lunch, the salad is usually like some kind of lettuces, apples, walnuts, some kind of cheese, some kind of dressing, maybe some other junk thrown in there.

768
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:53,909
Rym: A walnut is the nut of any tree of the genus Juglans juglandusae.

769
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:56,105
Scott: Juglans juglandusae?

770
00:37:56,430 --> 00:38:00,710
Rym: Particularly the Persian or English walnut, Juglans regia, is King Juglans.

771
00:38:01,551 --> 00:38:02,497
Rym: Oh no, here's the funny part.

772
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,550
Rym: See if you can guess why I was giggling.

773
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:05,749
Scott: Juglans juglans?

774
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:11,110
Rym: It is used for food after being processed while green for pickling walnuts or after full ripening.

775
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:12,230
Scott: I've never had a pickled walnut.

776
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:13,189
Rym: For its nut meat.

777
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:18,970
Rym: Nut meat of the eastern black walnut is less commercially available, as are butternut nut meats.

778
00:38:21,011 --> 00:38:25,330
Scott: So the walnut actually comes in a shell, but rarely do you see it with the shell in the store, right?

779
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:27,857
Rym: Unless you have one of those poisonous shit fake walnut trees.

780
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:45,890
Scott: Yeah, so the walnut usually comes out of its shell in a bag, but that's okay, because walnuts really, while being so great to be the number two nut, are not as delicious as pistachio if you're just eating them by the fistful.

781
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:50,750
Rym: Yes, a raw pistachio just dried without salt or anything on it is super delicious.

782
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:52,210
Scott: It's so delicious, with salt it just makes it better.

783
00:38:52,692 --> 00:38:55,746
Scott: A walnut, salted or no, is not something you just want to eat.

784
00:38:55,786 --> 00:38:56,610
Scott: I mean, it's okay.

785
00:38:57,615 --> 00:38:58,730
Rym: I prefer them unsalted.

786
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:01,130
Scott: Sure, but I mean, it's not usually salted, right?

787
00:39:01,711 --> 00:39:03,629
Rym: Well, if they're mixed in with other nuts.

788
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:12,570
Scott: Even if you roast it, which really brings out the flavor of a walnut more than any other nut, when I bake with a walnut, I will often toast them before putting them in for the baking.

789
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:15,110
Rym: Yeah, I learned how to toast different kinds of nuts in the Blue Apron.

790
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:21,630
Scott: Toasting the walnut really brings out the flavor more than any other nut I've ever used, which is part of why it's so good for baking.

791
00:39:21,891 --> 00:39:28,410
Scott: But anyway, it's still, even toasted to perfection, eating a raw walnut isn't really amazing, right?

792
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:36,089
Scott: It's all about putting it in the baked good so that it combines with sugars and the butters and the flowers and the chocolates and whatever else is in there.

793
00:39:36,831 --> 00:39:49,363
Scott: And usually you buy them in a sack chopped up and they are perhaps even more, if not as expensive, as the pistachio, which is why when you go to like a frozen yogurt place, where they're selling frozen yogurt for like 79 cents an ounce or 49 cents an ounce-

794
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:51,628
Rym: No walnuts?

795
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:54,109
Scott: And walnut is one of the available toppings.

796
00:39:54,751 --> 00:39:57,620
Scott: Just scoop walnuts into a cup with no yogurt.

797
00:39:57,941 --> 00:40:00,470
Scott: You are getting a mad deal on that shit, yo.

798
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:07,430
Rym: Now there's the mega form, the mega evolution of the walnut, the candied walnut.

799
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:11,730
Scott: Yes, often now I will notice I went to the frozen yogurt place to try to scoop some walnuts.

800
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:14,485
Scott: They didn't have the walnut just sitting there on its own.

801
00:40:14,505 --> 00:40:15,329
Scott: I think they were onto me.

802
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:19,170
Scott: They had the walnut suspended in sugary syrup.

803
00:40:19,592 --> 00:40:23,230
Scott: Perhaps it was maple-ish, perhaps it was caramel-ish, whatever.

804
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:24,127
Rym: That's no good.

805
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:27,045
Rym: But it was- I'm talking about the candied walnut.

806
00:40:28,132 --> 00:40:29,030
Scott: That's a candied walnut.

807
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:34,090
Rym: No, but the ones that are like separate individual walnuts with a thin crusty layer.

808
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:35,135
Scott: Well, how do you think you make that?

809
00:40:35,156 --> 00:40:37,150
Scott: You take it out of the syrup and you leave it out.

810
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,469
Rym: So they leave it just sitting there in the syrup.

811
00:40:39,656 --> 00:40:41,610
Scott: Well, I mean, you know, they don't want it to go bad just sitting there.

812
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:48,769
Rym: I guess I only ever encountered candied walnuts in like expensive dishes I've ordered at restaurants, like ringed around a salad.

813
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:53,130
Rym: Like salt and fat and that one salad that we get every time we go there.

814
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:59,870
Scott: Well, there was that place we went to that had like the one night of, you know, what was it, what country was that?

815
00:41:00,133 --> 00:41:00,909
Rym: Oh, the Finnish thing?

816
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:03,269
Scott: Yeah, they had some walnut action going on.

817
00:41:03,391 --> 00:41:04,729
Rym: Oh yeah, that was super good.

818
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:06,996
Rym: Right, so- Was it Finnish, Swedish?

819
00:41:07,096 --> 00:41:09,690
Rym: I already forgot Emily's gonna yell at us when she listens to this.

820
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:11,790
Scott: Sorry, Northern European country, your food was delicious.

821
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:12,850
Rym: That place was super good.

822
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:13,786
Scott: We can't remember you.

823
00:41:14,155 --> 00:41:14,348
Rym: Yeah.

824
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:18,790
Rym: Anyway- Well, because it's gone and also that was one of the more expensive dinners we've had in a long time.

825
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:20,889
Rym: Yeah, we couldn't eat there regularly.

826
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:23,209
Scott: Well, it was a one night deal, so it was a pop up.

827
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:28,850
Scott: Anyway, yeah, you're right, the candied walnut and salt and fat is so good, right?

828
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:31,950
Rym: But that's because it's paired very well with like this particular kind of salad.

829
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:32,572
Scott: Same thing, it's like.

830
00:41:32,592 --> 00:41:37,010
Scott: the walnut is so powerful, but it only works in combos and you got to do something with it.

831
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:40,390
Scott: It's not like the pistachio where you can just eat it or combo it.

832
00:41:40,671 --> 00:41:46,790
Scott: The walnut is very relatively weak on its own, but super powerful when comboed.

833
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:48,049
Scott: It's like a synergy nut.

834
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:53,070
Rym: So when I was young, like when I was really young, I pretty much considered the cashew to be the king of all nuts.

835
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:53,930
Scott: Cashew's okay.

836
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:55,230
Rym: Because I liked cashews a lot.

837
00:41:55,250 --> 00:42:00,650
Scott: I mean, I like a cashew, but it's not like it's up there with the pistachio and the walnut.

838
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:06,630
Rym: Yeah, but they're one of the nuts that I can eat in bulk when I'm hungry and feel pretty good about it.

839
00:42:07,452 --> 00:42:15,050
Scott: So I would often go to the Duane Reade and they had this magic mix and the magic mix used to be called Raisin Nut Mix before they changed the brand.

840
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:22,710
Scott: And basically what it is, is peanuts, cashews, M&Ms and some other junk mixed together in a bag.

841
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:25,469
Scott: So I realized they were charging a lot of money for that.

842
00:42:26,592 --> 00:42:30,590
Scott: I realized that by weight, I could actually save money by making it myself.

843
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:38,510
Scott: So I go to the grocery store, I would buy a thing of peanuts, a thing of cashews, a thing of sunflower seeds, a thing of M&Ms or chocolate chips.

844
00:42:40,893 --> 00:42:43,929
Scott: And sort of mix all that together in a bag and shake it up.

845
00:42:44,831 --> 00:42:48,250
Scott: And that is a delicious magic mix of nutness that you can get.

846
00:42:48,934 --> 00:42:50,110
Scott: You don't have to do the chocolate if you want.

847
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:51,750
Scott: You can put dried fruit in there, some raisin.

848
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:52,787
Scott: Raisin is good in there.

849
00:42:54,392 --> 00:42:55,930
Scott: I was Raisin Nut Mix originally, right?

850
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:59,510
Scott: You can also put like some dried, any kind of fruit you want.

851
00:42:59,651 --> 00:43:02,109
Scott: Apricot, pineapple, whatever, you know.

852
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:10,770
Scott: It's a really good nut usage where you can get the full power out of something like the peanut or the cashew by making a trail-ish mix out of it.

853
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:13,650
Rym: So, not that I'm not a fan of, actually.

854
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:15,550
Rym: I think my least favorite nut is the Brazil Nut.

855
00:43:16,658 --> 00:43:20,019
Rym: I don't eat- That's the big motherfucker that's hanging out in the mixed nuts.

856
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:23,490
Rym: that kind of just tastes dry and bland and is just in the way.

857
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:30,990
Scott: I don't eat the Brazil Nut very often, but I think I might agree with you except for the fact that I specifically dislike the chestnut.

858
00:43:31,852 --> 00:43:31,994
Rym: What?

859
00:43:32,014 --> 00:43:33,370
Rym: The chestnut's one of my favorite nuts.

860
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:36,490
Scott: So the chestnut, I mean, maybe it's because you're a goyim, right?

861
00:43:36,551 --> 00:43:38,110
Scott: But the Jews don't really eat the chestnut.

862
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:38,568
Rym: Why not?

863
00:43:39,011 --> 00:43:41,510
Scott: It's like a holiday Christmas goyim thing.

864
00:43:42,093 --> 00:43:44,050
Rym: Yeah, it's also just like a delicious thing.

865
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:48,850
Scott: I mean, I tried it once and it's sort of like I'll put it over there with the eggnog, right?

866
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:51,149
Rym: Wait, how did you try a chestnut?

867
00:43:51,492 --> 00:43:54,230
Scott: You know how they have them, they're all heated up, right?

868
00:43:54,731 --> 00:43:57,287
Scott: And they're in the shell, you open the shell, you take the nut out and you eat it.

869
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:02,069
Rym: See, the real secret is you get chestnut things.

870
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:06,970
Rym: Kind of like with walnuts and baking, get like a chestnut pastry.

871
00:44:08,192 --> 00:44:08,990
Scott: I guess that could be okay.

872
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:09,698
Rym: You know who has these?

873
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:13,709
Scott: If you're ever downtown- Well, like when you're in New York City, right?

874
00:44:14,131 --> 00:44:16,289
Rym: The hot dog vendors in the winter- No, no, fuck those guys.

875
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:17,406
Rym: Fuck the street nuts.

876
00:44:17,951 --> 00:44:19,970
Scott: They always have the little- I never had eaten one of those.

877
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:23,990
Rym: Well, most of those guys are selling like other weird nuts or they're selling like just almonds.

878
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:26,250
Scott: Right, but I'm not talking about the nuts truck.

879
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:35,270
Scott: I'm talking about the guy who sells hot dogs, but in the winter he brings out the chestnut tray where he's got a little circle thing with tinfoil with chestnuts in it near this fire, right?

880
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:35,925
Scott: And he's heating them up.

881
00:44:36,672 --> 00:44:37,597
Scott: And they're, you know, it's like.

882
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:45,270
Scott: I didn't have that from those guys, but I basically had that at like a friend's house who was roasting chestnuts and I'm not into it really.

883
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:45,720
Scott: Yeah.

884
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:47,710
Rym: You run into them a lot in Turkey.

885
00:44:47,831 --> 00:44:50,330
Rym: Like every street corner there's just chestnuts everywhere.

886
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:54,044
Rym: But I don't really like them that much in that form.

887
00:44:54,064 --> 00:44:54,769
Rym: I actually like them in-.

888
00:44:54,910 --> 00:45:03,408
Rym: If you go to Takahachi, that really good Japanese bakery downtown, kind of by City Hall, they have basically blueberry and chestnut pastries- Oh, that could be good.

889
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:04,814
Rym: That have like cheese.

890
00:45:04,915 --> 00:45:06,080
Rym: They're so good.

891
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,968
Rym: I eat one like at least once a week.

892
00:45:08,068 --> 00:45:08,410
Rym: One of the two.

893
00:45:08,692 --> 00:45:09,108
Scott: I'll eat that.

894
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:09,672
Rym: Yeah.

895
00:45:09,995 --> 00:45:11,450
Rym: Crazy, dangerously good.

896
00:45:11,651 --> 00:45:17,650
Scott: But I mean, there's no way that that can approach anywhere near walnut, pistachio or even peanut level.

897
00:45:18,072 --> 00:45:19,530
Rym: No, it's better than peanut.

898
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:25,610
Rym: Peanut's a different purpose because peanut is the default nut and it's the savory nut.

899
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:25,931
Scott: Right.

900
00:45:25,951 --> 00:45:34,030
Scott: Well, in the United States peanut is the default nut and people like to look down on it the same way that like someone who eats fancy hamburgers might look down on a McDonald's.

901
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:37,110
Rym: Like they see the peanuts in the mixed nuts box as filler.

902
00:45:37,431 --> 00:45:37,672
Scott: Right.

903
00:45:37,713 --> 00:45:40,490
Scott: And it's like you should look down on the McDonald's, right?

904
00:45:40,652 --> 00:45:42,550
Scott: But you should not look down on the peanut.

905
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:47,083
Scott: The peanut is the default nut, but it is so, you know, popular.

906
00:45:47,103 --> 00:45:49,290
Scott: that doesn't mean that it's bad.

907
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:50,463
Scott: A peanut is super delicious.

908
00:45:50,524 --> 00:45:50,990
Scott: Peanut butter.

909
00:45:53,594 --> 00:45:54,784
Rym: I prefer actually peanuts.

910
00:45:54,925 --> 00:45:59,330
Scott: I like- Going to the baseball game, buying a bag of peanuts, making a big mess, letting someone else sweep it up.

911
00:45:59,611 --> 00:46:00,989
Rym: I like wasabi peanuts.

912
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:02,629
Scott: Honey roasted peanut.

913
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:04,010
Rym: I'm not a big fan of honey roasted-.

914
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:09,970
Scott: See, peanut is so common, right, that you can start to get these variations on it that you can't do with the other nut.

915
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:13,190
Scott: It's like, you know, pistachio and turkey, peanut in the U.S.

916
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:14,416
Scott: And it's still good.

917
00:46:14,456 --> 00:46:15,783
Scott: If I lived in Turkey and I came to the

918
00:46:15,843 --> 00:46:16,105
Scott: U.S.,

919
00:46:16,145 --> 00:46:16,889
Scott: I'd be like, "Oh my God,

920
00:46:16,909 --> 00:46:17,090
Scott: peanuts.".

921
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:24,090
Rym: See, my favorite kind of peanut, bar none, is the simple oil-roasted peanut with a little bit of salt.

922
00:46:24,275 --> 00:46:24,467
Rym: Yeah.

923
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:27,870
Rym: That is the best form of peanut in the world, in my opinion.

924
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:32,630
Rym: Because dry roasted gets kind of like dusty if you're eating a lot of them.

925
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:34,270
Rym: Like you can't eat a lot without feeling sick.

926
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:36,590
Scott: Do you still eat the shells like a nut job?

927
00:46:37,172 --> 00:46:38,638
Rym: Well, so we're talking about now.

928
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,470
Rym: I'm only talking about peanuts that are not in their shells.

929
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:43,629
Scott: Oh, see, I was talking about the shell when I was talking about the baseball game.

930
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:47,410
Rym: Yeah, well, the baseball game peanut is a different kind of peanut experience.

931
00:46:48,691 --> 00:46:49,768
Scott: It's all the same nut, yo.

932
00:46:50,251 --> 00:46:55,810
Rym: Yeah, but those are brined and it's not like the salt or dry or roasted outside.

933
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:56,786
Scott: How do they get the salt in there?

934
00:47:00,832 --> 00:47:07,870
Rym: To this day, I've occasionally run into people who exclaim something to that effect when I'm eating around us.

935
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:11,504
Scott: They have a tiny syringe and they squirt salt into everyone.

936
00:47:12,026 --> 00:47:13,110
Scott: There's a hole, you just can't find it.

937
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:13,814
Rym: They're artisanal.

938
00:47:13,874 --> 00:47:15,163
Rym: No, they actually bred them.

939
00:47:15,203 --> 00:47:16,290
Rym: That salt's natural.

940
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:17,578
Scott: They put salt in the dirt.

941
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,149
Scott: It doesn't kill the peanut.

942
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:20,089
Rym: That's totally fine.

943
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:23,629
Rym: But I don't eat those kinds of peanuts that often.

944
00:47:25,512 --> 00:47:30,369
Scott: I eat peanut butter more than I eat peanuts, but I will eat peanut rather often.

945
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:34,870
Scott: You know, usually in the bag of magic mix or something like that that I put together.

946
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:41,290
Rym: Wow, there is a question on the straight dope and someone is just like, "So, I've seen this happen in movies.

947
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:45,965
Rym: Do people actually eat the entire peanut, including the

948
00:47:46,026 --> 00:47:46,307
Rym: shell?".

949
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:47,970
Scott: I do not.

950
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:49,449
Rym: The first post is my mom used to.

951
00:47:49,550 --> 00:47:50,150
Scott: That is disgusting.

952
00:47:50,653 --> 00:47:51,790
Rym: I do it sometimes.

953
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:53,753
Scott: The outside part is not food.

954
00:47:53,914 --> 00:48:02,548
Scott: That is like eating the, I don't know, like the rind of an orange or the peel on a banana.

955
00:48:04,110 --> 00:48:05,730
Rym: Oh, you know what I've never had?

956
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:06,508
Scott: You don't eat that.

957
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:14,290
Rym: Someone has suggested deep fry peanuts in the shells and then eat the whole thing.

958
00:48:15,631 --> 00:48:19,710
Scott: I guess that could be better, but you could just deep fry peanuts.

959
00:48:23,893 --> 00:48:26,565
Rym: Okay, I used to eat salted in the shell peanuts hole.

960
00:48:26,626 --> 00:48:27,530
Rym: I grew up eating that way.

961
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:33,130
Rym: I discovered that if you eat too many of them, you experience a phenomenon that would be best described as anal splinters.

962
00:48:33,893 --> 00:48:34,809
Scott: Yes, don't do that.

963
00:48:35,651 --> 00:48:37,923
Rym: Usually what I do is I'd eat like every fifth or sixth one.

964
00:48:37,943 --> 00:48:38,748
Rym: I just eat the whole thing.

965
00:48:40,653 --> 00:48:46,490
Scott: Something else though about the peanut is that unlike other nuts, you know, I talked about the walnut needs like an upgrade.

966
00:48:47,013 --> 00:48:50,570
Scott: The peanut, you can't upgrade it too much besides peanut butter, right?

967
00:48:51,012 --> 00:48:51,309
Scott: Wasabi.

968
00:48:52,270 --> 00:48:57,610
Scott: Sure, but you can downgrade it by making peanut brittle, which is disgusting old people candy.

969
00:48:57,730 --> 00:48:58,218
Rym: What's wrong with you?

970
00:48:58,238 --> 00:48:58,970
Scott: Peanut brittle is fine.

971
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:01,110
Scott: As disgusting old people candy that you should not eat.

972
00:49:01,511 --> 00:49:05,490
Rym: I think you're just hung up on the name and the fact that it features in a lot of media involving old ladies.

973
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:08,322
Scott: No, I would eat it when it would come in Halloween.

974
00:49:08,342 --> 00:49:10,110
Scott: Some old lady would give it to you and it was never good.

975
00:49:10,853 --> 00:49:12,109
Scott: I've tried to eat it so many times.

976
00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:21,070
Scott: Even go into places where it's like, you know, you go to like a tourist place and there'll be like a fudge and, you know, some butterscotch sticks and there'll be some peanut brittle.

977
00:49:21,211 --> 00:49:24,185
Scott: And I would get like one everything and the peanut brittle was like, why did I get that?

978
00:49:24,205 --> 00:49:25,229
Scott: I should have gotten just more fudge.

979
00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:28,058
Rym: Yeah, I'm a fan of the peanut.

980
00:49:28,098 --> 00:49:31,350
Rym: The problem is peanuts, like any other, but more so than any other nut.

981
00:49:32,031 --> 00:49:35,550
Rym: If there's a bowl of peanuts and I'm near them pretty much, I'm going to eat them all.

982
00:49:36,356 --> 00:49:36,498
Scott: Goodbye.

983
00:49:36,903 --> 00:49:37,410
Scott: Goodbye.

984
00:49:39,753 --> 00:49:41,841
Scott: Yeah, that's why I put the peanut is even above the cashew.

985
00:49:41,861 --> 00:49:44,330
Scott: If there's a bowl of cashews, I'm not just going to dig in like crazy.

986
00:49:44,471 --> 00:49:45,989
Rym: Well, I'll kind of alternate between the two.

987
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:47,910
Scott: I mean, I will eat them, but I won't like.

988
00:49:48,691 --> 00:49:56,310
Rym: If I was going to make my magic mix of like nuts to have out just for like casual consumption at a party, there'd be one bowl that was a mix of cashews and peanuts.

989
00:49:57,051 --> 00:50:01,610
Rym: One bowl that was just pistachios and one bowl that was just toasted pistachios.

990
00:50:02,412 --> 00:50:08,590
Scott: I usually take my magic mix and I put it in a. I'll put it all in one big giant Ziploc bag, the big kind and shake it up like crazy.

991
00:50:08,971 --> 00:50:17,190
Scott: And then I'll go biking or something and I'll pour out a little bit from the big bag into a little bag and take that with me in a little jersey pocket thing.

992
00:50:18,112 --> 00:50:19,297
Scott: And that's that's how you do.

993
00:50:19,719 --> 00:50:21,910
Rym: I'm kind of done with pecans other than in pie.

994
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:25,150
Scott: Yeah, pecan is really like a pie only kind of deal.

995
00:50:25,351 --> 00:50:29,250
Scott: I mean, I've never I think maybe a few times I've eaten them, not in a pie.

996
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:33,230
Scott: And it was like like while I was making a pie, maybe I don't know.

997
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:34,977
Scott: Or maybe while someone else is making a pie.

998
00:50:35,057 --> 00:50:37,850
Scott: And it's not something I really want to eat too much.

999
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:41,570
Scott: It's not like ew, I don't want to eat this like the chestnut area.

1000
00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:48,650
Scott: But it's not like, you know, I mean, if if there was a bowl of them next to a bowl of cashews, I probably wouldn't even need one pecan.

1001
00:50:49,452 --> 00:50:52,448
Scott: But if there was a pie, I would cut off a nice slice.

1002
00:50:53,752 --> 00:50:56,530
Rym: But I think the nut I'm the most sick of, of all things, is actually the almond.

1003
00:50:56,930 --> 00:50:58,837
Rym: Like, I don't like most.

1004
00:50:59,178 --> 00:51:02,450
Rym: most forms that almond are presented to me in as nuts.

1005
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:03,714
Rym: Well, they're not nuts.

1006
00:51:03,754 --> 00:51:04,277
Rym: They're droops.

1007
00:51:05,161 --> 00:51:06,830
Rym: The fruit of the almond is a droop.

1008
00:51:07,771 --> 00:51:12,590
Scott: So the almond, I actually like the almond a lot, especially when it's put in the chocolate bar.

1009
00:51:12,790 --> 00:51:13,376
Rym: Exactly.

1010
00:51:13,396 --> 00:51:14,890
Rym: I like that form of almond.

1011
00:51:15,151 --> 00:51:17,190
Scott: But I also like just an almond, a sack of almonds.

1012
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:17,491
Scott: All right.

1013
00:51:17,531 --> 00:51:19,136
Scott: Sometimes they'll put the almonds in the magic mix.

1014
00:51:19,156 --> 00:51:23,769
Scott: The thing is, I think the almond is a lot like the cilantro.

1015
00:51:24,450 --> 00:51:29,490
Scott: I think there are some people who just they try to eat the almond, then it's no good for them.

1016
00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:30,295
Rym: See, it's not that though.

1017
00:51:30,315 --> 00:51:31,180
Rym: Like, I liked almond.

1018
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,549
Rym: You see them a lot, but I'm kind of sick of them.

1019
00:51:33,410 --> 00:51:37,530
Rym: And they're usually like too dry or they don't fit the other things I've got around.

1020
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:43,950
Scott: The other thing is that almond prices are going up and there's a lot of things people are doing with almonds, like almond milk.

1021
00:51:44,531 --> 00:51:44,812
Scott: Right.

1022
00:51:45,934 --> 00:51:46,916
Scott: People don't know this.

1023
00:51:46,997 --> 00:51:47,979
Scott: Well, some people know this.

1024
00:51:48,841 --> 00:51:52,830
Scott: You can use almond extract instead of vanilla extract.

1025
00:51:54,254 --> 00:51:55,590
Rym: And you probably won't even notice the difference.

1026
00:51:56,151 --> 00:51:58,761
Scott: Well, no, it's actually sometimes it could be way better.

1027
00:51:58,841 --> 00:52:00,990
Scott: Depends on what you're baking, which one you want to choose.

1028
00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:02,874
Scott: But they're both really expensive.

1029
00:52:03,416 --> 00:52:09,390
Scott: But almond extract is like that's hot stuff to have for like, you want to step up your baking like next level.

1030
00:52:09,791 --> 00:52:13,970
Scott: Instead of using vanilla for everything, figure out when to use the almond and when to use the vanilla.

1031
00:52:16,212 --> 00:52:21,270
Rym: I guess I only like almonds like with olives and in almost no other context as just a nut on its own.

1032
00:52:22,310 --> 00:52:23,576
Scott: I could eat a sack of almonds.

1033
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:24,883
Rym: I wouldn't though.

1034
00:52:25,003 --> 00:52:26,410
Scott: More readily than cashews.

1035
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:27,874
Rym: I would eat a sack of cashews.

1036
00:52:27,915 --> 00:52:31,050
Rym: In fact, I did eat a sack of cashews over the last two and a half days.

1037
00:52:31,811 --> 00:52:33,519
Rym: So I just bought a big sack of them.

1038
00:52:33,559 --> 00:52:35,327
Rym: I set them on my desk because I'm stupid.

1039
00:52:35,347 --> 00:52:35,910
Rym: Now they're gone.

1040
00:52:36,334 --> 00:52:36,596
Scott: All right.

1041
00:52:37,061 --> 00:52:37,950
Rym: Hence my tweet earlier.

1042
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:39,913
Scott: The almonds are also good.

1043
00:52:39,933 --> 00:52:44,910
Scott: If you're going to make mixes with almonds, it's usually better with fruity mixes.

1044
00:52:45,692 --> 00:52:47,668
Scott: Almonds and dates, almonds and figs.

1045
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:49,522
Rym: I like almond with something.

1046
00:52:49,542 --> 00:52:50,610
Rym: I don't like almond by itself.

1047
00:52:50,970 --> 00:52:54,250
Scott: By itself is good, but with the chocolate, with the fruit is better.

1048
00:52:54,330 --> 00:52:54,998
Rym: And it's got to be toasted.

1049
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:56,090
Rym: I don't like raw almonds either.

1050
00:52:57,030 --> 00:52:59,861
Scott: I like the ones when they have the little skin on them still.

1051
00:52:59,881 --> 00:53:02,290
Scott: If the skin is gone, then it's not having a problem.

1052
00:53:03,292 --> 00:53:04,297
Scott: I need that little skin there.

1053
00:53:04,317 --> 00:53:07,130
Scott: I like the pistachio with a little skin way better also.

1054
00:53:07,370 --> 00:53:09,750
Rym: When I'm cooking, blanched olives and things are sometimes useful.

1055
00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:13,610
Scott: Actually, I think with every kind of nut, I like the little skin that's on there.

1056
00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:14,691
Rym: All right.

1057
00:53:14,731 --> 00:53:17,885
Rym: We have talked about nuts for 55 minutes.

1058
00:53:19,251 --> 00:53:20,330
Scott: Well, some of that was news time.

1059
00:53:20,350 --> 00:53:20,935
Rym: Some of it was.

1060
00:53:21,358 --> 00:53:22,890
Rym: I think we can stop talking about nuts.

1061
00:53:23,290 --> 00:53:24,509
Scott: See, I told you this is the right topic.

1062
00:53:24,690 --> 00:53:25,288
Rym: Yeah, it was a good show.

1063
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:27,397
Scott: Send us your other nut varieties.

1064
00:53:27,458 --> 00:53:29,767
Scott: Do not tell us what is and is not a nut.

1065
00:53:29,868 --> 00:53:30,370
Scott: You can shove it.

1066
00:53:30,430 --> 00:53:31,489
Rym: That's a bannable offense.

1067
00:53:38,033 --> 00:53:40,170
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1068
00:53:40,390 --> 00:53:45,330
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1069
00:53:45,710 --> 00:53:50,730
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1070
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:53,650
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1071
00:53:53,910 --> 00:53:58,410
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1072
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:01,926
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1073
00:54:03,173 --> 00:54:06,250
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1074
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:09,350
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1075
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:36,239
Scott: The assigned value is $100, and I hold in my hand the last piece of art.

1076
00:54:38,764 --> 00:54:43,980
Rym: Item number 69, a watercolor titled Exchanging Fluids by Brian Swards of York.

1077
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:47,160
Rym: The dimensions are 24 inches wide by 19 inches high.

1078
00:54:48,101 --> 00:54:54,520
Scott: And this is really, we were saying, kind of a companion piece to the Brian Swards piece that we had up on the table previously.

1079
00:54:55,741 --> 00:54:58,560
Rym: Actually, this one should have come up first, and that should have been the later piece.

1080
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,680
Scott: A little bit on both, right?

1081
00:55:01,741 --> 00:55:05,500
Scott: And anyhow, it also is self-explanatory, certainly.
