1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,350
Rym: It's Tuesday, July 21st, 2015.

2
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:13,774
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,954 --> 00:00:15,639
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,780
Rym: tonight We're talking about party games specifically Jackbox games.

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,261
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:23,281 --> 00:00:31,230
Rym: I would have tried to make a joke about like yeah, you don't know Jack, but I don't know anyone.

7
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:36,096
Rym: I don't think I've ever known anyone named Jack In my entire life.

8
00:00:36,438 --> 00:00:43,645
Scott: I did camp counselor was named Jack one really yeah Maybe maybe my roommate and I had a co-worker named Jack that roommate at RIT.

9
00:00:43,665 --> 00:00:45,090
Rym: I never knew his name might have been Jack.

10
00:00:45,331 --> 00:00:45,994
Rym: I don't really know.

11
00:00:46,114 --> 00:00:46,476
Scott: I don't know.

12
00:00:46,496 --> 00:00:47,561
Scott: don't ask me about your roommate.

13
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:49,570
Rym: Yeah, just don't ask me about my roommate.

14
00:00:50,591 --> 00:00:52,502
Rym: People always think it's weird that I never knew the dude's name.

15
00:00:52,542 --> 00:00:53,568
Rym: We never talked to each other.

16
00:00:54,932 --> 00:00:57,285
Rym: We just sat back to back and that was.

17
00:00:57,366 --> 00:00:57,748
Rym: that was it.

18
00:00:58,612 --> 00:01:02,829
Rym: Our only interaction was once he said yes something happened to your fridge when that wine bottle exploded in it.

19
00:01:05,987 --> 00:01:09,068
Scott: I Beat a. I beat a Porsche 911 in a race today on my bike.

20
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:17,370
Scott: oh Yeah, I know that sounds impossible But there was a lot of traffic in his way and I can get through Emily and I beat the seven train on Sunday.

21
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:18,514
Scott: It's not hard either.

22
00:01:18,534 --> 00:01:23,290
Rym: Yeah, we biked to flushing and yeah, we can bike to flushing way faster than the seven goes to flushing.

23
00:01:25,731 --> 00:01:29,066
Rym: It's a nice bike though, there's basically a bike path that goes almost straight there the whole way.

24
00:01:29,287 --> 00:01:29,890
Scott: yeah pretty much.

25
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:32,909
Rym: We also found a secret path back that I never used before.

26
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:36,474
Rym: Okay, yeah, cuz I said I wouldn't talk about the commute But I can talk about this.

27
00:01:36,877 --> 00:01:49,170
Rym: so instead of going on the one side of Citi Field We went like on the backside by all that weird car repair districts you mean Willits Point yeah that whole area there, and you went along the water.

28
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:55,849
Rym: No So there's a. it looks like you're gonna get on the freeway and get the more you bike.

29
00:01:55,889 --> 00:01:56,473
Rym: that way You're like.

30
00:01:56,554 --> 00:01:58,530
Rym: this is just taking me onto the freeway.

31
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:02,710
Rym: I'm going on the freeway and now it's telling me to go into a parking lot.

32
00:02:03,052 --> 00:02:13,410
Rym: And then actually on the freeway by the movie theater no There's a little hidden bike path that I never would have even known was there And it's kind of creepy and isolated and like at this weird place.

33
00:02:14,013 --> 00:02:16,506
Rym: I only found it because I had Google Glass on and I was like glass.

34
00:02:16,526 --> 00:02:24,500
Rym: take me home And it told me a bikeway, and I kind of followed it despite my better judgment saying this doesn't seem right But it totally was right.

35
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,329
Scott: this goes along the water to the West.

36
00:02:28,131 --> 00:02:28,875
Rym: No, that's not.

37
00:02:29,157 --> 00:02:31,028
Scott: I don't know where the hell you're talking about you.

38
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:35,350
Rym: on a map It's not long because you get to the normal bike path right after all that.

39
00:02:35,631 --> 00:02:37,362
Rym: But there's just one little like shunt.

40
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:38,629
Rym: it goes through a weird place.

41
00:02:41,126 --> 00:02:42,218
Rym: Yeah, I Didn't expect you to.

42
00:02:42,278 --> 00:02:43,609
Rym: I just found a cool path.

43
00:02:44,951 --> 00:02:47,698
Scott: How do I doubt the coolness of your path?

44
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:50,847
Rym: it was pretty cool, uh-huh, I was very pleased with this path.

45
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:54,603
Rym: sure I Can't talk about anything else related to biking.

46
00:02:54,623 --> 00:02:55,429
Rym: Thanks to my promise.

47
00:02:56,812 --> 00:02:59,550
Scott: Is there any gaming news that has a ton of gaming news?

48
00:02:59,892 --> 00:03:02,109
Scott: Way too much gaming news if you haven't done a show in a long time.

49
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:05,104
Rym: We actually I think wasn't our last show a gaming show.

50
00:03:05,305 --> 00:03:06,130
Scott: that was a long time ago.

51
00:03:06,411 --> 00:03:07,695
Rym: I was like right before ConnectiCon.

52
00:03:07,715 --> 00:03:13,995
Rym: it wasn't that long ago still yeah, so we were at ConnectiCon and There's a bunch of gaming news.

53
00:03:14,456 --> 00:03:15,159
Rym: so first off.

54
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,165
Rym: There is the Kickstarter.

55
00:03:17,185 --> 00:03:18,749
Rym: that happened that we haven't talked about it all yet.

56
00:03:20,455 --> 00:03:25,559
Scott: Shenmue 3 Full and I never played Shenmue 1 or 2. so why would I?

57
00:03:29,912 --> 00:03:33,190
Scott: These games on like the Sega Saturn or the Dreamcast or whatever there isn't or a PlayStation.

58
00:03:33,272 --> 00:03:34,994
Scott: They were on systems I didn't have and couldn't play.

59
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:45,480
Rym: these games are those games that a lot of people I knew knew people who were really into them But I never really knew anyone who was really into them.

60
00:03:46,022 --> 00:03:48,349
Rym: and the best way I can describe them is you know how?

61
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:48,830
Rym: in modern?

62
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,435
Rym: Pokemon games there's a mill.

63
00:03:50,455 --> 00:03:54,890
Rym: you just wander around and do a bunch of million things that don't really matter at all.

64
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,437
Rym: Imagine that times a hundred.

65
00:03:57,477 --> 00:04:00,550
Scott: yeah everything ever read about this game would simultaneously be like whoa.

66
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,698
Scott: That's so cool like you can do everything.

67
00:04:02,778 --> 00:04:10,957
Scott: It's like real-life simulator almost, but then it's like oh There's no reason to do everything It's just a time waster.

68
00:04:10,977 --> 00:04:12,826
Scott: you might as well be rune factory for.

69
00:04:12,846 --> 00:04:13,710
Rym: well in fact there.

70
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,796
Rym: Well rune factory 4 has the dating element.

71
00:04:15,877 --> 00:04:22,009
Scott: It has dating and farming and monster killing and all the things yeah as every possible thing.

72
00:04:23,071 --> 00:04:23,753
Rym: Well, there's a.

73
00:04:23,793 --> 00:04:25,217
Scott: that's all there is in life right?

74
00:04:25,418 --> 00:04:28,507
Rym: remember that old old old penny arcade comic about those games.

75
00:04:28,928 --> 00:04:29,490
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

76
00:04:30,551 --> 00:04:35,308
Rym: So what's interesting is that this was the definition of an old?

77
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:50,950
Rym: Popular franchise that it just sort of disappeared that was definitely niche Not actually that widely played or that why I had so much critical Acclaims and the people who did get into it and didn't enjoy it.

78
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:55,730
Rym: It was like the best thing for much like Sonic the fans Sonic the Hedgehog erotic fiction.

79
00:04:56,252 --> 00:05:00,449
Rym: It's one of those things where there's a small, but extremely vocal and dedicated fan base.

80
00:05:01,473 --> 00:05:06,166
Rym: So yeah the Kickstarter happened, and it raised like over six million dollars.

81
00:05:06,266 --> 00:05:06,928
Scott: That's about right.

82
00:05:07,048 --> 00:05:07,249
Scott: Yeah,

83
00:05:07,549 --> 00:05:30,960
Rym: well What's interesting to me the the the point about this is that a lot of people were saying we're complaining That the game raised so much money and a lot of other people seem to have really overblown expectations about the game like because it raised such a huge amount that the game is gonna be like the fully realized vision of Wander around and randomly do stuff in convenience stores.

84
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:33,290
Scott: the game six million dollars isn't a lot of money.

85
00:05:33,491 --> 00:05:36,170
Rym: No, okay for a budget for a game like this.

86
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:41,529
Scott: Maybe if they had 30 million it would be that you need more than that.

87
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:49,169
Rym: Yeah, so this game's not going to be the second coming of Jesus Or I guess the first coming is Jesus never existed, but I digress.

88
00:05:50,211 --> 00:06:02,259
Rym: But it is very interesting to me that This kind of property was remembered enough by people dedicated enough to our 70,000 people collectively pledged Six million dollars.

89
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,303
Scott: Can you emulate this thing?

90
00:06:03,343 --> 00:06:04,930
Scott: I'm curious to go and play the old ones.

91
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,518
Scott: Should we do it see what the reality is?

92
00:06:06,659 --> 00:06:08,549
Rym: should we just play these games?

93
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,277
Scott: It's not possible to emulate them.

94
00:06:11,357 --> 00:06:12,101
Scott: I'm not gonna do it.

95
00:06:12,402 --> 00:06:14,090
Scott: I'm not gonna buy a Dreamcast or some shit.

96
00:06:14,251 --> 00:06:19,153
Rym: I'll bet you can get one on eBay real cheap Whatever.

97
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:19,917
Scott: It's not worth it.

98
00:06:20,098 --> 00:06:22,110
Rym: No, I mean we might have a Dreamcast.

99
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,016
Rym: I'm gonna have one laying around.

100
00:06:23,036 --> 00:06:24,284
Scott: you have a Dreamcast just laying around.

101
00:06:24,305 --> 00:06:24,788
Scott: No, you don't.

102
00:06:25,331 --> 00:06:28,542
Rym: I have someone we know probably has one that someone you know, but you don't.

103
00:06:28,743 --> 00:06:30,790
Rym: yeah, I'll have that pile of any s's.

104
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:31,626
Rym: I'll trade someone.

105
00:06:33,231 --> 00:06:39,961
Rym: Actually, one of the any s's has a low serial number and apparently people who really care about this too much Care about their what.

106
00:06:40,002 --> 00:06:41,830
Rym: which of the 11?

107
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:45,329
Rym: Versions of the chip or the board in an any s you have?

108
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:48,970
Scott: well One of those is my any s and one of them is I think your brothers or something.

109
00:06:49,251 --> 00:06:51,880
Rym: Well, and there was the third one that we gave away to someone.

110
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:56,178
Rym: I forget when but that was the one that we won When I won.

111
00:06:56,238 --> 00:06:56,601
Rym: right right.

112
00:06:56,621 --> 00:06:57,446
Rym: so come turn him.

113
00:06:57,466 --> 00:06:58,030
Scott: That's right.

114
00:06:58,311 --> 00:07:01,690
Scott: So the one I think your original any s is the one that got given away.

115
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:07,315
Scott: Yeah, and we have the duck hunt one that we won and we we we we I won Sure.

116
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:10,270
Scott: and then my original any s from when I was a kid.

117
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,422
Scott: So mine is probably the old.

118
00:07:12,502 --> 00:07:13,890
Scott: mine came with a red gun though.

119
00:07:13,951 --> 00:07:15,150
Scott: So it can't be red guns.

120
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,639
Scott: Not the old one can't be old if it has the red gun.

121
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:21,934
Rym: the difference between them is actually useful if you're a collector Like it actually is.

122
00:07:22,135 --> 00:07:22,918
Scott: what's the difference?

123
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:26,130
Rym: the earliest boards have no lockout at all?

124
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:29,479
Rym: So every tangen bootleg bullshit cartridge will totally work fine.

125
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,144
Scott: Mine worked with tangen Tetris.

126
00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:39,847
Scott: Yeah with micro machines I never tried my and those Bible games never tried Bible games but we definitely were able to play tangen Tetris on that any s. cuz it happened.

127
00:07:40,048 --> 00:07:44,545
Rym: so as Versions came out the last versions of the any s actually locked out.

128
00:07:44,586 --> 00:07:49,570
Rym: top loader everything You mean top loader know the lat of the original any s the top loader even diff.

129
00:07:49,731 --> 00:07:52,361
Rym: No, the top loader had a different board.

130
00:07:52,502 --> 00:07:54,590
Scott: Okay, but the top loader was the last any s.

131
00:07:54,811 --> 00:07:58,089
Rym: Yes, but it was also a different iteration of the any s. it was a different sku.

132
00:07:58,511 --> 00:07:59,817
Rym: It wasn't just a different board.

133
00:07:59,917 --> 00:08:02,307
Scott: inside of the same sku my cousin had top loader.

134
00:08:02,528 --> 00:08:06,256
Rym: Yeah I Remember when the top loader came out.

135
00:08:06,296 --> 00:08:08,906
Rym: I couldn't understand why anyone didn't already have an any s.

136
00:08:09,107 --> 00:08:10,693
Scott: Yeah Either.

137
00:08:10,854 --> 00:08:11,557
Scott: and now it's like man.

138
00:08:11,597 --> 00:08:13,324
Scott: I wish had a top loader so much more reliable.

139
00:08:13,364 --> 00:08:14,870
Rym: Yeah, so what this gives me?

140
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:15,131
Rym: Hope.

141
00:08:15,472 --> 00:08:18,123
Rym: I'm now waiting for the radish skull and devil.

142
00:08:18,143 --> 00:08:19,549
Scott: doll Kickstarter make it.

143
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:26,201
Scott: Yeah, just make it and hope that the guy who made radish skull and devil now sees it And decides that he's actually gonna make it.

144
00:08:26,341 --> 00:08:27,910
Rym: I don't think he owns the copyright though.

145
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,643
Rym: Remember all that complicated story of why they didn't own thing.

146
00:08:30,703 --> 00:08:32,010
Rym: Anyway, I don't think he does.

147
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,678
Rym: That's why the rest of it didn't get made.

148
00:08:33,717 --> 00:08:35,426
Rym: That was like a promotional thing.

149
00:08:35,506 --> 00:08:36,190
Scott: So that's your news.

150
00:08:36,311 --> 00:08:37,460
Rym: There's gonna be a psychonauts.

151
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,629
Rym: I'm waiting for that to get remade.

152
00:08:39,691 --> 00:08:42,342
Rym: All those games all those weird things gives me.

153
00:08:42,384 --> 00:08:47,981
Rym: Hope that maybe in a far future They'll be an advanced Wars Kickstarter Rampart Kickstarter Rampart Kickstarter.

154
00:08:48,021 --> 00:08:49,144
Rym: We just make rampart.

155
00:08:49,164 --> 00:08:50,186
Rym: just fucking remake it.

156
00:08:50,206 --> 00:08:56,237
Rym: kaboom - yeah electric boogaloo bombaloo You got any news.

157
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:06,060
Scott: There's so much gaming news going on I can't even Touch but I just want to pick this gaming news since I have the most to say about it Even though there's probably more important.

158
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,126
Scott: gaming news is out there.

159
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:16,282
Scott: Yep So I guess ESWC stands for eSports world championship or European something world championship.

160
00:09:16,443 --> 00:09:19,070
Rym: I actually can't keep all the league straight in my head anymore.

161
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:19,940
Rym: Yeah, look it up ever.

162
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,122
Rym: I don't

163
00:09:20,162 --> 00:09:44,843
Scott: know but You know, it was a eSports championship of some kind and There was counter-strike played there and this guy on team Nehillum or Nylem or whatever named Simpis S-E-M-P-H-I-S is doing this interview about what happened there and He just comes out and admits that his whole team was on Adderall the whole time

164
00:09:45,004 --> 00:09:46,850
Rym: which like that's actually pretty common.

165
00:09:47,091 --> 00:09:54,188
Scott: I mean if there's such high stakes and you want to win and there's no rule against it and there's no drug test Why wouldn't you?

166
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:58,750
Rym: Yep, that's why we have drug testing in professional sports, right?

167
00:09:59,331 --> 00:10:12,709
Scott: So, you know, this is something that you know, this is yet another example of something we've been talking about for years That actually came to be or is actually now in the spotlight and it's like, yep, look how smart we are.

168
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:26,361
Rym: Yeah, well, it's interesting because you know, actually one of our packs panel to talk about about a moment But we are doing a panel sports or games talking about games and sports and the overlap A moment of that panel discussing this rather this topic.

169
00:10:26,522 --> 00:10:43,464
Rym: Yes, and it'll be really interesting because we're seeing gaming and professional gaming go through all the same sort of learning curves as professional sports and interestingly very few of the leagues seem to be Actively looking at like the NFL like what do they do?

170
00:10:43,565 --> 00:10:44,710
Rym: Why don't we just do that?

171
00:10:45,292 --> 00:10:51,749
Scott: I mean and you know and you think about okay So the big eSports leagues might do something about this eventually or maybe they won't.

172
00:10:51,769 --> 00:10:55,263
Scott: maybe It's like well if you want to win eSports, you're gonna take Adderall, right?

173
00:10:55,343 --> 00:10:56,347
Scott: Otherwise, how are you gonna compete?

174
00:10:56,989 --> 00:11:03,350
Scott: Yeah But what does this say for like your local Street Fighter tournament at your college, right?

175
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:06,090
Scott: One guy takes Adderall and wins well at the same.

176
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:08,418
Rym: Well, I guess the difference is do you know some?

177
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:12,396
Scott: or and as time goes on you think Adderall is gonna be like the only Drug, right?

178
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:13,770
Scott: There's gonna be some crazy shit out there.

179
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:14,634
Scott: You can take it's like I.

180
00:11:14,794 --> 00:11:18,490
Rym: you know, I run like dumpy local races and I'll you know win a trophy or whatever.

181
00:11:18,871 --> 00:11:23,449
Rym: But if I wanted to really what if I just started using strychnine to win those races?

182
00:11:23,931 --> 00:11:24,875
Scott: Well, they'll kill you also.

183
00:11:24,996 --> 00:11:29,629
Rym: No strychnine was actually so, you know how we should all have a race walking Cuz it's a terrible sport.

184
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:30,733
Scott: There's drugs and racewalk.

185
00:11:31,374 --> 00:11:37,129
Rym: race walking might be the first sport that people use performance enhancing drugs in.

186
00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:43,949
Rym: Wow Yeah, they would dope themselves up on strychnine and all sorts of stuff just to keep it going just to keep walking keep walking.

187
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:45,516
Scott: But that doesn't.

188
00:11:45,637 --> 00:11:46,160
Scott: how could that help?

189
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:46,501
Rym: it does.

190
00:11:46,522 --> 00:11:47,165
Rym: it keeps you awake.

191
00:11:47,205 --> 00:11:48,009
Rym: it's they would use.

192
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,996
Scott: Sleeping is what makes you lose.

193
00:11:50,016 --> 00:11:54,190
Rym: Well, so in the old days race walking was more of a endurance challenge.

194
00:11:54,311 --> 00:11:56,250
Rym: It was just whoever goes the longest.

195
00:11:57,432 --> 00:11:57,574
Rym: Mmm.

196
00:11:57,715 --> 00:12:00,135
Rym: days and days and days and days and days The sports.

197
00:12:00,155 --> 00:12:02,470
Rym: they fucked up history and it's still a terrible sport.

198
00:12:02,951 --> 00:12:09,877
Scott: But if you needed one more reason to hate it, but I mean take for example, right like the netrunner world champion, Dan Yeah, he's an okay guy.

199
00:12:09,977 --> 00:12:11,606
Scott: Yeah ish right ish.

200
00:12:12,068 --> 00:12:12,470
Scott: He's okay.

201
00:12:12,872 --> 00:12:16,170
Scott: He's not like a bad person and he's really fucking good at netrunner.

202
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:19,590
Scott: But it's like we're at the Philly regionals.

203
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:24,348
Scott: It is his local store and he's just like vaping in you know, because the store doesn't stop him.

204
00:12:24,388 --> 00:12:24,930
Scott: It's his store.

205
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:25,493
Scott: They don't care.

206
00:12:25,836 --> 00:12:27,043
Scott: so I can't say anything about it.

207
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:31,293
Scott: if the store allows it All right, may or may not and it's like state be illegal I don't know.

208
00:12:31,313 --> 00:12:36,349
Scott: I don't know about the laws or anything, but in terms of the fairness of this tournament I mean, it's just a small time.

209
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:45,410
Scott: I mean, it's a netrunner regional, but I mean a netrunner regional might as well be like, you know In terms of all the gaming sports tournaments in the world, that's pretty low bar, right?

210
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:51,036
Scott: Yeah, that's probably even smaller than your local 5k race or whatever You know, and it's it.

211
00:12:51,298 --> 00:12:52,726
Scott: he's taking drugs.

212
00:12:52,846 --> 00:12:53,490
Scott: Is it helping him?

213
00:12:53,610 --> 00:13:05,668
Scott: I mean part of the tournament is that you got to play seven rounds in netrunner and then elimination rounds You know and last the whole day and keep concentrating and stay on your a-game the whole time from 11 a.m To like 11 midnight midnight.

214
00:13:07,535 --> 00:13:10,575
Rym: So here's there's the question that that will Right.

215
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:11,959
Rym: when should he be?

216
00:13:11,979 --> 00:13:15,670
Scott: even if you made him go outside is he still is that easy allowed to do that?

217
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:22,410
Rym: When and why did the NHL and the NFL and Major League Baseball and all these things crack down on start testing for drugs in sports?

218
00:13:23,012 --> 00:13:28,570
Rym: Was it not partially because the government started getting involved and poking his nose and saying I do something?

219
00:13:29,472 --> 00:13:37,269
Rym: I don't think the government is capable of even understanding that video games Played professionally are a thing for at least 20 more years.

220
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:44,710
Scott: Well, I mean, you know if the it's because the big big professional sports in the US are regulated in some ways by the government?

221
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:51,239
Rym: Yes, partly because of the money and the infrastructure and also, you know The government just had a vested interest for various reasons.

222
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,310
Scott: plus when you know, and the the sports leagues buy into this, right?

223
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:59,665
Scott: You know, there's all the controversies about like, you know, the local people buying stadiums for the teams.

224
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,213
Scott: It's like well sure It's like.

225
00:14:02,455 --> 00:14:04,566
Scott: we probably shouldn't be doing that definitely shouldn't be.

226
00:14:04,606 --> 00:14:11,550
Scott: but if we are Suddenly right there the sports leagues are allowing all that sort of government interference to come in.

227
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:15,370
Scott: It's like well, we bought you a stadium which means now we can get fuck you over.

228
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:21,530
Rym: But I I don't think there will be any such pressure from the government unless the story and the narrative become.

229
00:14:21,993 --> 00:14:24,810
Rym: Kids are doping themselves up in these video game tournaments.

230
00:14:25,071 --> 00:14:30,150
Rym: But I suspect the reaction will be banning video game tournaments not regulating them like we regulate the NFL.

231
00:14:30,672 --> 00:14:34,966
Scott: But I mean, you know, the other thing is like why even ban this right?

232
00:14:34,986 --> 00:14:35,247
Scott: Why not?

233
00:14:35,267 --> 00:14:35,869
Scott: Just allow it.

234
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:43,960
Rym: well, you make the same argument about football right and the answer is it fucks you up and Maybe we shouldn't encourage football.

235
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,485
Scott: fucks you up drugs or no drugs.

236
00:14:45,606 --> 00:14:46,830
Rym: Yeah, but the drugs do not help.

237
00:14:47,131 --> 00:14:48,797
Scott: So use baseball as your example instead.

238
00:14:48,957 --> 00:14:49,740
Rym: Okay or tennis.

239
00:14:50,121 --> 00:14:50,864
Scott: Yeah tennis great.

240
00:14:50,944 --> 00:14:52,550
Scott: Yeah, why not allow it in tennis?

241
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:56,510
Rym: Well, because those drugs do have hired increase like increased chances of death.

242
00:14:56,852 --> 00:15:01,555
Scott: Let's say someone invented a performance enhancing drug that Didn't really hurt you that much.

243
00:15:01,656 --> 00:15:03,764
Scott: I mean is Adderall really gonna shorten your life that much?

244
00:15:03,905 --> 00:15:05,030
Rym: really maybe you don't know.

245
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,718
Rym: I mean, I'm not a pharmacologist.

246
00:15:06,758 --> 00:15:08,950
Scott: It's not like you're not like you're on crack or meth.

247
00:15:09,231 --> 00:15:13,524
Rym: It's more the question of do you want sports to go down that road?

248
00:15:13,604 --> 00:15:17,699
Rym: because then everyone in that sport Will have to go down that road to compete.

249
00:15:18,161 --> 00:15:23,970
Rym: and if that is the case and there are adverse effects You're probably causing a net harm to society for no tangible benefit.

250
00:15:24,653 --> 00:15:28,432
Scott: It's also creates this barrier to entry where like someone like me I can't.

251
00:15:28,572 --> 00:15:36,342
Scott: if you know everyone in the whole who plays this game is taking this drug and I don't want to take that drug Then I can't compete in that sport.

252
00:15:36,362 --> 00:15:37,790
Scott: That's like an unfair barrier to entry.

253
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,319
Scott: Imagine if you want to go get a job, right?

254
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:39,922
Scott: Remember sports.

255
00:15:39,983 --> 00:15:40,425
Rym: All right, Scott.

256
00:15:40,465 --> 00:15:42,816
Scott: I'll turn around To go get a job.

257
00:15:42,876 --> 00:15:46,390
Scott: and they're like if you want this job, you must snort some cocaine.

258
00:15:46,631 --> 00:15:48,097
Scott: Otherwise, you can't have this job.

259
00:15:48,137 --> 00:15:49,403
Scott: That's basically what they're saying.

260
00:15:49,443 --> 00:15:50,548
Rym: I'll play the devil's advocate.

261
00:15:50,568 --> 00:15:52,959
Rym: back at you I got a kind of real example.

262
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,065
Scott: that is sports or a job.

263
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:58,241
Rym: Yeah, so For my job I pretty much have to be able to drink alcohol.

264
00:15:58,442 --> 00:15:59,448
Rym: with people like.

265
00:15:59,548 --> 00:16:03,650
Rym: I can Drink less and actually I have more than one dump drinks out in bushes.

266
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:13,807
Rym: but if I didn't drink alcohol and didn't hide that fact a lot of people would like it would be difficult for me to do Business because that's just how that world is.

267
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:16,148
Rym: So you couldn't do my job.

268
00:16:17,213 --> 00:16:18,585
Rym: This is the barrier to the same barrier to entry.

269
00:16:18,605 --> 00:16:19,069
Rym: Is that okay?

270
00:16:20,551 --> 00:16:21,098
Scott: Probably not.

271
00:16:21,321 --> 00:16:21,584
Rym: Yeah.

272
00:16:21,827 --> 00:16:22,810
Rym: All right Here's another example.

273
00:16:23,151 --> 00:16:30,321
Rym: There is a barrier to entry to baseball in that you have to be super strong and you have to be willing to work out a Bunch, are you willing to do pull-ups every day?

274
00:16:30,341 --> 00:16:31,989
Rym: or is that a barrier to entry?

275
00:16:32,069 --> 00:16:32,190
Scott: Right?

276
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:33,437
Scott: Well, I mean that's the thing is right.

277
00:16:33,457 --> 00:16:35,510
Scott: It's like genetics Gattaca, right?

278
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:39,690
Scott: I mean there are certain things that are you know, do you have the skills for the job?

279
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:43,210
Scott: It's like oh you can't be a programmer unless you have programming skills.

280
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,910
Rym: What if one of those skills is willing to take Adderall, right?

281
00:16:46,331 --> 00:16:49,864
Scott: You know willing and you know able are different right?

282
00:16:49,904 --> 00:16:50,586
Rym: Well, you're able.

283
00:16:50,626 --> 00:16:51,550
Rym: you just aren't willing.

284
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,797
Scott: That's you know, there's a lot of questions there.

285
00:16:54,817 --> 00:16:55,881
Rym: Yeah, there are a lot of questions.

286
00:16:56,222 --> 00:16:59,476
Rym: Maybe this is gonna be a fascinating panel We're running at packs.

287
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:01,043
Scott: Anyway, this is just.

288
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:05,790
Scott: you know, this is just the first instance I've seen of just someone coming out and admitting what everyone already knew.

289
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:09,003
Rym: Well, they do they admit it but not for Adderall.

290
00:17:09,044 --> 00:17:10,430
Rym: It was always one step below that.

291
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:14,609
Rym: It was like the energy drinks in the caffeine and the guarana and all that shit.

292
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:15,718
Rym: This is like a step up.

293
00:17:16,021 --> 00:17:20,882
Rym: right, you know There's cocaine and amphetamines going on - you know every there.

294
00:17:21,063 --> 00:17:23,089
Scott: anything that can help anyone is being used.

295
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:28,717
Rym: But at the same time I get the impression a lot of things that don't help or in fact Actively hurt are being used as well.

296
00:17:29,138 --> 00:17:32,510
Rym: I don't think marijuana really makes you better at counter-strike.

297
00:17:33,171 --> 00:17:35,044
Scott: Yeah, no, I doubt it does.

298
00:17:35,064 --> 00:17:47,370
Scott: Yeah But you know, it would be interesting right for like a you know, especially for things like, you know Due to his vaping right is a mild stimulant like, you know regular old e-cigs really gonna help you that much?

299
00:17:47,912 --> 00:17:59,510
Scott: Maybe not right, but if there's such a serious competition and say somebody is you know Like addicted to that and your answer to that is like anyone who's competing during the course of the tournament.

300
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:00,495
Scott: We're gonna lock you in.

301
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,364
Rym: Yeah, that's the reverse barrier to entry of up.

302
00:18:02,384 --> 00:18:05,758
Rym: Sorry, you're addicted to cigarettes So now you can't compete in eSports, right?

303
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:08,207
Scott: It's like you're you know, that's part of the thing right.

304
00:18:08,227 --> 00:18:12,450
Scott: when you go black dynamite I'm addicted to steroids and cocaine like when you're in the Olympics, right?

305
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:14,098
Scott: Not only do they test you but it's like they're.

306
00:18:14,258 --> 00:18:16,510
Scott: you know, they're keeping you in that Olympic village and shit.

307
00:18:16,611 --> 00:18:23,284
Scott: You can't go screwing around Inside the village, you know, so there's another similar story sex.

308
00:18:23,364 --> 00:18:25,309
Scott: Apparently Olympic Village is so much sex going on.

309
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:30,870
Scott: So because it's all hot people from around the world who are relatively young and also I thought I was gonna bring that up.

310
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:35,145
Rym: I was gonna I was gonna make that's like the sex fiesta of the world.

311
00:18:35,687 --> 00:18:36,410
Scott: is the Olympic Village?

312
00:18:36,852 --> 00:18:39,205
Rym: Make an oblique reference to that and then turn it into a joke.

313
00:18:39,245 --> 00:18:40,954
Rym: and you were just like, oh, yeah You know, it's a sex village.

314
00:18:41,134 --> 00:18:42,379
Scott: It is pretty much everything.

315
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,890
Scott: I've heard is the Olympic Village is like the sexiest place.

316
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:57,965
Rym: so at Evo 2015 fighting game tournament happening Street Fighter 4 dudes controller broke in the middle of it and The story around this is pretty interesting, but it's a finals.

317
00:18:57,985 --> 00:18:58,970
Scott: First of all, it's a big deal.

318
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:02,500
Rym: This is a big deal, but you can read the story.

319
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:04,647
Rym: We don't report news on GeekNights.

320
00:19:04,667 --> 00:19:05,550
Rym: We just comment on it.

321
00:19:06,232 --> 00:19:16,250
Rym: What we want I want to talk about is that the rules that they had they had rules about this about what to do with The right, you know Evo is like a legit thing that's been going on for a long time.

322
00:19:16,551 --> 00:19:20,150
Scott: It's like they're not amateur hour when it comes to this kind of situation.

323
00:19:20,711 --> 00:19:25,204
Rym: So here are the rules on equipment failure in a tournament at Evo.

324
00:19:25,505 --> 00:19:29,788
Scott: Okay reporting equipment failure I mean the fact that they have these rules shows it's not amateur hour.

325
00:19:29,888 --> 00:19:30,974
Rym: Yep I mean and like.

326
00:19:30,994 --> 00:19:37,069
Rym: this is another example of this area this arena this Genre of gaming is maturing.

327
00:19:38,091 --> 00:19:40,420
Rym: video game hardware has the tendency to break down during tournaments.

328
00:19:40,461 --> 00:19:45,390
Rym: buttons or joysticks will occasionally break down in the middle of a match leaving a Player on the broken side at a significant disadvantage.

329
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:52,614
Rym: The following rules will be used in the event of a break breakdown one in the event of an equipment player Failure.

330
00:19:53,157 --> 00:19:55,530
Rym: the player has the out there a lot of typos in this.

331
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,171
Rym: I apologize.

332
00:19:56,492 --> 00:20:00,960
Rym: the player has the option to stop the game in progress and obtain a replacement.

333
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:06,520
Rym: if The game is stopped in progress the reporting player must forfeit the current rounds.

334
00:20:07,662 --> 00:20:10,332
Rym: New equipment must immediately be available.

335
00:20:10,493 --> 00:20:12,320
Scott: Yeah, I'm sure the pros are bringing multiple joy.

336
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,348
Rym: It doesn't say who is responsible for that.

337
00:20:14,388 --> 00:20:17,180
Rym: That's something the end of the NHL pros are the pros.

338
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:24,928
Rym: They're not showing up with one fight I know but I'm saying the NHL rules have things like the sticks are provided in this Capacity the pucks.

339
00:20:24,948 --> 00:20:28,347
Scott: your equipment manager takes care of it But it's all in the rules.

340
00:20:28,367 --> 00:20:34,096
Scott: if you're if you're so pro at Street Fighter that that is your job Because that's how good you have to be to make it to these finals.

341
00:20:34,156 --> 00:20:38,540
Scott: and at Evo You've got probably a person who's carrying a joysticks around.

342
00:20:38,941 --> 00:20:39,723
Rym: But what it's just.

343
00:20:39,763 --> 00:20:46,460
Rym: it's interesting to point out that this equivalent section in ice hockey rules is like four times longer.

344
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:50,146
Rym: sure New equipment must be immediately available.

345
00:20:50,387 --> 00:20:53,515
Rym: if replacement equipment cannot be obtained in a timely manner you lose.

346
00:20:53,816 --> 00:20:58,586
Rym: the player must continue to play on their current equipment or Forfeit the match.

347
00:20:58,626 --> 00:21:00,917
Scott: Well, if your thing is just completely broken doesn't do anything.

348
00:21:00,937 --> 00:21:04,932
Rym: You're just gonna lose The entire match not around.

349
00:21:05,152 --> 00:21:21,213
Rym: sure once replacement equipment is obtained the player is given the rest of that round to configure their buttons and test the new equipment if The player gains an undue advantage by doing so Exempli a gratis charging an abundance of super meter.

350
00:21:21,534 --> 00:21:23,100
Rym: They must forfeit that game.

351
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:29,420
Rym: Mmm that rule is good, but has too much ambiguity.

352
00:21:31,022 --> 00:21:33,654
Rym: It says charging an abundance of super meters.

353
00:21:33,754 --> 00:21:34,940
Scott: Yeah, let me charge a little bit.

354
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,832
Scott: It's if you charge any super meter at all.

355
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,039
Scott: Why is that fair?

356
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,920
Rym: Yeah, now maybe charge it a little bit is kind of like stepping a little bit past the base.

357
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:47,448
Rym: It's like yeah, just push it a little bit kind of like in hockey Like yeah, if you drop your stick Well, fuck you.

358
00:21:47,488 --> 00:21:48,639
Rym: like you can try to pick it up.

359
00:21:49,103 --> 00:21:51,180
Rym: If you break your stick, well, you gotta go get a new one.

360
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,619
Rym: You don't get another person on the ice while you're doing that.

361
00:21:54,322 --> 00:21:59,700
Rym: So Oh a player may opt to switch out equipment between games with no penalty.

362
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,002
Rym: Yeah This occurs.

363
00:22:01,263 --> 00:22:05,740
Rym: the player will be given ample time to configure his buttons before the game begins.

364
00:22:06,282 --> 00:22:10,557
Rym: Not super fan of the gendered language, even though that's technically correct, but whatever whatever.

365
00:22:10,898 --> 00:22:11,520
Scott: but yeah.

366
00:22:11,962 --> 00:22:15,655
Scott: So they but they have a rule for the situation and the situation happened.

367
00:22:15,996 --> 00:22:17,000
Scott: So they followed the rule, right?

368
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:24,840
Rym: Yep, they followed the rule and the story is that apparently The players thought that the fact that he had to forfeit was kind of bullshit.

369
00:22:25,542 --> 00:22:29,370
Rym: So they agreed to alternate procedures among themselves.

370
00:22:30,881 --> 00:22:34,057
Scott: So while that's I mean on paper, that's kind of cool, right?

371
00:22:34,097 --> 00:22:35,182
Scott: It's like, okay That's at.

372
00:22:35,242 --> 00:22:38,373
Scott: the thing that actually happened is probably a more satisfying thing, right?

373
00:22:38,734 --> 00:22:41,669
Scott: Someone didn't just get an automatic loss They actually played it out.

374
00:22:42,051 --> 00:22:45,539
Scott: They even like Right and they really restarted the thing.

375
00:22:46,061 --> 00:22:54,780
Scott: They let the timer run down to where the timer was when the breakage happened and they punched each other just enough to have as Much damage done to them as it was when the thing happened.

376
00:22:55,121 --> 00:23:01,289
Scott: so it's like they picked up where they left off which is kind of much more satisfying for the Spectators and for the fairness of who wins right.

377
00:23:01,309 --> 00:23:07,011
Scott: if you just get an automatic loss because your controller broke That's kind of disappointing and not cool.

378
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:13,680
Scott: So what happened was cooler, but You can't just have two players Deciding to use a different rule.

379
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:15,447
Scott: You can't be like at the Super Bowl.

380
00:23:15,608 --> 00:23:17,836
Scott: at the start of the Super Bowl both coaches come out and they're like,

381
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:19,302
Rym: yeah Ref,

382
00:23:19,362 --> 00:23:24,956
Scott: we both decided that during this Super Bowl touchdowns will be worth five points instead of the usual

383
00:23:24,976 --> 00:23:34,003
Rym: but at the same time Because these are eSports unlike human sports with just humans bumping into each other There are.

384
00:23:34,104 --> 00:23:39,000
Rym: there is a lot more capacity for rolling things back and doing alternate procedures.

385
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:45,178
Rym: So that kind of interaction could be one of the hallmarks of some eSports in the future.

386
00:23:45,198 --> 00:23:47,120
Scott: that it yeah That would be a good thing, right?

387
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,786
Scott: I mean the fact that you can Like at a football game.

388
00:23:49,826 --> 00:23:54,936
Scott: sometimes if there's like it's hard to roll back more than one play To redo something if something was mess.

389
00:23:55,097 --> 00:23:57,740
Rym: imagine I'm not saying the same but imagine an advanced wars tournament.

390
00:23:58,041 --> 00:24:03,420
Rym: You could theoretically roll back in turns if you needed to write like the net runner tournament.

391
00:24:03,561 --> 00:24:04,326
Scott: I was at some.

392
00:24:04,628 --> 00:24:16,390
Scott: something that happens a lot is Someone will like Accidentally leave their cards behind in the previous game and it'll get shuffled into their previous opponents deck and then they'll play a new game And then in the next round and missing some cards.

393
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:20,607
Scott: and that's why you count your cards for every round to make sure you have Them all and you don't have any extras.

394
00:24:21,289 --> 00:24:24,040
Scott: and if you do have extras then you give them back, right?

395
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:33,200
Scott: But it's like I've had seen people play games Missing cards in their deck and you know, we don't have rules yet because the company that makes netrunner sucks at this.

396
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:41,520
Scott: But I've seen some judges say yeah You'll just have to replay that game since the game you played with while missing cards doesn't count and you just roll it back.

397
00:24:42,143 --> 00:24:51,000
Scott: But you know in eSports the rolling back is much more possible Than in say baseball where you'd have to keep fans there for another two hours if you rolled back to say the fourth inning.

398
00:24:51,683 --> 00:24:52,568
Scott: You know, you can roll back.

399
00:24:52,588 --> 00:24:54,477
Scott: You can say up that last Street Fighter match didn't count.

400
00:24:54,498 --> 00:24:54,920
Scott: play it again.

401
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:55,983
Rym: Yeah, this matters a lot.

402
00:24:56,003 --> 00:24:57,366
Rym: Remember the Omega.

403
00:24:57,406 --> 00:25:00,775
Scott: you can say this Starcraft match fucked up at one minute.

404
00:25:01,176 --> 00:25:02,540
Scott: It's all recorded digitally.

405
00:25:02,781 --> 00:25:06,095
Scott: We'll just read roll the replay back to the one-minute mark.

406
00:25:06,396 --> 00:25:07,200
Scott: Ready set go.

407
00:25:07,721 --> 00:25:10,388
Rym: Remember the Omega thon finale at PAX East.

408
00:25:10,428 --> 00:25:19,352
Rym: that was the Nintendo World Championships redone and how the games failed Like more than halfway through the first go.

409
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:20,939
Rym: so they had to start over and do it again.

410
00:25:21,802 --> 00:25:28,269
Rym: The team that was winning the first time was winning because they knew how to play fucking Mario one Yeah, the other team didn't.

411
00:25:28,651 --> 00:25:33,133
Rym: but because the other team Basically got that practice round and then they had to start over.

412
00:25:33,214 --> 00:25:34,579
Rym: the other team was able to win.

413
00:25:35,082 --> 00:25:42,611
Rym: They would definitely not have won if they'd played the original match all the way through But the original match was fouled by an equipment failure.

414
00:25:42,691 --> 00:25:45,020
Rym: Mmm, so these issues.

415
00:25:45,622 --> 00:25:53,159
Scott: While there are many more ways to roll back but in a professional competition Learning something from the practice match isn't gonna make a big difference.

416
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:55,650
Scott: Yeah unless what it could.

417
00:25:55,730 --> 00:26:05,620
Scott: right if you're playing Street Fighter and Practice match and someone revealed their hidden card that they had been saving for the finals And then that match gets undone and they have to redo it again.

418
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,944
Scott: But now, you know, they're hidden card.

419
00:26:07,445 --> 00:26:08,849
Scott: They better have another hidden card.

420
00:26:08,929 --> 00:26:16,020
Rym: Otherwise, yeah, or even what about just situations like What is the test of skill you'd always talk about in an ortho game?

421
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,566
Rym: What is the thing that you're ostensibly testing?

422
00:26:18,586 --> 00:26:24,420
Rym: the omega-thon is ostensibly testing a combination of your skillet games and your knowledge of games.

423
00:26:25,022 --> 00:26:43,363
Rym: So now that the people who had more knowledge of Mario 1 lost that Advantage because that knowledge was given to the other team in the restart anyway, eSports are both simpler and easier in the sense that you can do clever things with the rules and you can buck all the traditions that constrain a Lot of sports,

424
00:26:43,483 --> 00:26:51,740
Scott: but even though even the most pro level ones still are not Mature yet in terms of you know, I mean they're getting there rapidly.

425
00:26:51,921 --> 00:26:57,999
Scott: Evo is probably the top tier if there is a tier But it's still not as good as it needs to be yet.

426
00:26:58,961 --> 00:27:02,540
Rym: Also final note this stuff is gonna be big business down the road.

427
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:06,579
Rym: So it's already big high school kids looking for careers in the future.

428
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:11,614
Rym: eSports eSports stuff is actually a valid career path, right?

429
00:27:11,654 --> 00:27:17,431
Rym: I mean like team managers You're basically all the jobs that like baseball and football have.

430
00:27:17,451 --> 00:27:25,055
Scott: you could be the equipment manager for someone who's really good at Starcraft And you're all like getting keyboards and mice and polishing them and shit.

431
00:27:25,095 --> 00:27:29,614
Rym: Yeah, you could be the commentator You could be the ref you could be the commissioner.

432
00:27:29,634 --> 00:27:30,960
Scott: Yeah, boo.

433
00:27:31,582 --> 00:27:32,627
Scott: And then they'll be talking about you.

434
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:33,350
Scott: I'll be booing you.

435
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:38,700
Scott: They'll be talking about you on ESPN, you know You could be the the trophy polisher, right?

436
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,763
Scott: It's your job to manage.

437
00:27:39,803 --> 00:27:45,640
Rym: the Starcraft Hall of Fame is the one that the biggest thing that eSports lack is a Stanley Cup equivalent.

438
00:27:46,566 --> 00:27:48,303
Rym: Make it yeah There's got to be an.

439
00:27:48,724 --> 00:27:54,080
Scott: make an overall eSports championship and make a trophy for it and then manage it in a Stanley Cup fashion.

440
00:27:54,621 --> 00:27:55,565
Rym: Well, you know we could do.

441
00:27:55,645 --> 00:27:56,929
Rym: we could do it the way they have to.

442
00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:13,148
Scott: they have to compete in the FPS the RTS the fighting game the turn-based strategy game of some sort boxing the actual sport and also the The What the classic arcade style game.

443
00:28:13,409 --> 00:28:15,135
Rym: so, you know we should do oh and pinball.

444
00:28:15,416 --> 00:28:22,274
Rym: the easy way to do that because you don't we don't have we don't own an NHL is You know, the Stanley Cup was a challenge cup for a long time.

445
00:28:22,294 --> 00:28:26,580
Rym: You make it a challenge cup You just officiate it and you set it up the way the Stanley Cup was.

446
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,574
Scott: So we just we just award it to the best eSports person in North America.

447
00:28:31,674 --> 00:28:39,126
Rym: every start using our own discretion Yes to start and then we basically just manage the rules of When and how it can be.

448
00:28:39,146 --> 00:28:43,081
Scott: we should go to the same place that Lord Stanley got the Stanley Cup from and buy a new Cup.

449
00:28:43,823 --> 00:28:48,157
Scott: Oh, so I'm sure a silver cup is expensive but affordable, especially if it's gonna last so long.

450
00:28:48,197 --> 00:28:48,899
Scott: It's probably worth it.

451
00:28:49,342 --> 00:28:50,771
Scott: Yeah, what can a silver cup be?

452
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:51,678
Scott: a few thousand dollars?

453
00:28:53,682 --> 00:28:54,985
Scott: Might even only be hundreds of dollars.

454
00:28:55,026 --> 00:29:00,020
Rym: silver isn't what we have to make the original that we keep ourselves for the museum piece.

455
00:29:00,161 --> 00:29:03,260
Scott: No, you know you get the use like the Stanley Cup.

456
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:06,312
Scott: They used that first one for quite a while until it got big.

457
00:29:06,774 --> 00:29:07,557
Scott: then they did something.

458
00:29:07,677 --> 00:29:08,320
Scott: then they made more.

459
00:29:09,024 --> 00:29:10,959
Scott: If it never becomes big, why would he buy two cups?

460
00:29:12,462 --> 00:29:20,948
Scott: One failed cup we can have so anyway.

461
00:29:21,049 --> 00:29:27,495
Rym: things of the day Crash bandicoot games were not that good.

462
00:29:27,595 --> 00:29:30,765
Scott: Like they're not There's 3d platform ease.

463
00:29:30,826 --> 00:29:31,749
Scott: I never cared.

464
00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:32,772
Rym: I mean, I've never really.

465
00:29:33,193 --> 00:29:35,783
Rym: they're very few of those games that I like Pretty much.

466
00:29:35,804 --> 00:29:37,895
Scott: you played Mario 64 and you really like it.

467
00:29:37,915 --> 00:29:41,504
Scott: you can play Mario Sunshines or galaxies and whatever.

468
00:29:41,524 --> 00:29:43,567
Scott: and then what do you need more of those for?

469
00:29:43,948 --> 00:30:02,800
Rym: but crash bandicoot exists and Very recently as in days ago their cutscenes That were for the first game Animated ones that were never actually used that had surfaced Occasionally and people seem to think they were from a an aborted cartoon.

470
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:15,176
Rym: But no, these were just lost cutscenes that weren't included in the game and Someone found them got permission from the producer of the game and put them on YouTube days ago.

471
00:30:15,196 --> 00:30:15,697
Scott: I like.

472
00:30:15,837 --> 00:30:22,041
Scott: I don't know Really it much about crash bandicoot at all But like the big very beginning of this looks very familiar Like.

473
00:30:22,081 --> 00:30:24,389
Scott: I feel like I've seen that background before.

474
00:30:24,429 --> 00:30:26,296
Rym: yeah, because that stuff is in the game.

475
00:30:26,356 --> 00:30:27,379
Scott: I never played the game.

476
00:30:27,862 --> 00:30:29,170
Rym: Yeah, well you might have bumped into.

477
00:30:29,231 --> 00:30:30,599
Scott: I feel like I've seen that guy.

478
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:34,360
Scott: Those some of those characters are vaguely familiar, but the background is really familiar.

479
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:41,512
Scott: I feel like this is reusing animation cells or backgrounds from something else that I've seen before Because I definitely haven't seen this before.

480
00:30:41,552 --> 00:30:42,659
Scott: that's not possible, right?

481
00:30:43,561 --> 00:30:48,580
Rym: So so, uh, yeah, you're really into furry adjacent properties like Sonic.

482
00:30:48,901 --> 00:30:52,477
Rym: Here's the beach here of that a never before seen footage.

483
00:30:52,497 --> 00:30:52,980
Rym: Okay?

484
00:30:53,982 --> 00:30:56,499
Scott: so, you know, we love to talk on GeekNights about.

485
00:30:57,761 --> 00:31:01,996
Scott: You know shit like making guns with your 3d printer, yeah, we do.

486
00:31:02,337 --> 00:31:03,040
Scott: here's a dude.

487
00:31:03,763 --> 00:31:05,391
Scott: I don't know who this is or what they do.

488
00:31:05,411 --> 00:31:08,543
Rym: the feds do because there's been a lot of Talk to him.

489
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:09,346
Scott: They got it.

490
00:31:09,366 --> 00:31:14,200
Scott: They got a gun a real gun like a handgun the kind that can kill somebody.

491
00:31:14,845 --> 00:31:29,905
Scott: They attached it with a stick To a drone with propellers on it and he arranged it such that it would fly Fire the gun and then the recoil would sort of push into the drone but the drone wouldn't crash or anything.

492
00:31:29,945 --> 00:31:34,658
Rym: drone is surprisingly capable of handling that recoil and it can shoot.

493
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:38,535
Scott: so You can just fly this drone and then shoot someone with it.

494
00:31:38,836 --> 00:31:39,620
Scott: It's possible.

495
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,366
Scott: Welcome to the year 2015.

496
00:31:42,366 --> 00:31:42,587
Scott: Yep.

497
00:31:42,687 --> 00:31:49,449
Rym: I posit that within a year or two Someone's gonna be murdered in the u.s.

498
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:51,437
Rym: By another civilian with a drone.

499
00:31:51,457 --> 00:32:06,179
Scott: I don't say a year or two I say five years because someone who is smart enough and capable of setting up the gun on drone is Someone who is smart enough to have a job and have a good life and be whatnot.

500
00:32:07,501 --> 00:32:11,854
Rym: Engineers were evil the world would collapse such that they won't be murdering anybody.

501
00:32:12,536 --> 00:32:25,919
Rym: But what if Someone like defense distributed got a little cough going on there Lingering for like days decides to make the 3d printed gun that Automatically works that connects to your 3d printed drone?

502
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,184
Scott: You have to be you have to.

503
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:31,439
Scott: it won't happen until this is so accessible until the self kitty.

504
00:32:31,659 --> 00:32:35,020
Scott: once Florida man can do this then there will be a big problem.

505
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:39,134
Scott: but until then it's just gonna be this awesome thing that we can talk about academically.

506
00:32:39,174 --> 00:32:48,740
Rym: cuz I'm gonna say if I if I were Like evil or there was someone I really needed to kill a drone like that Just fly up to their window and shoot them through their window and that would be the end of it.

507
00:32:49,142 --> 00:32:53,260
Scott: if there was something I really needed to kill I would pay someone to run them over with their car in New York City.

508
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,867
Scott: cuz You basically don't get punished for that at all.

509
00:32:54,887 --> 00:32:55,489
Scott: It's an accident.

510
00:32:55,992 --> 00:32:57,739
Rym: Oh, yeah, but why would I want to kill someone in New York?

511
00:32:58,901 --> 00:32:59,770
Scott: Maybe they're visiting.

512
00:32:59,871 --> 00:33:00,396
Scott: it's possible.

513
00:33:01,424 --> 00:33:06,225
Rym: It is possible, you know evil dictator visiting the UN Something like that in a moment.

514
00:33:06,506 --> 00:33:08,895
Rym: The book club book is still not water ship down.

515
00:33:08,955 --> 00:33:10,380
Rym: Scott did upset to update the website.

516
00:33:10,541 --> 00:33:14,298
Rym: It is the wheel of time the eye of the world the first book.

517
00:33:14,318 --> 00:33:18,107
Rym: I'm about Bob little over halfway through it.

518
00:33:18,128 --> 00:33:20,757
Scott: I'm a little over 25% through.

519
00:33:20,777 --> 00:33:21,600
Scott: I read them yesterday.

520
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,744
Rym: They're not on the second boat.

521
00:33:22,804 --> 00:33:23,146
Rym: Are they?

522
00:33:23,527 --> 00:33:24,631
Scott: they're not in the second boat.

523
00:33:24,671 --> 00:33:26,900
Scott: They are in the city that they got to.

524
00:33:28,081 --> 00:33:29,488
Scott: They're like, oh my god, it's a city.

525
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:32,240
Rym: You mean like barrel out of the share line, whatever.

526
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,550
Rym: They're not in the city city or the city city city.

527
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:38,198
Scott: No, they're the first the first city they've ever seen.

528
00:33:38,258 --> 00:33:38,719
Scott: bear land.

529
00:33:39,364 --> 00:33:40,555
Rym: Okay, you've.

530
00:33:40,696 --> 00:33:45,337
Rym: uh This is gonna be another situation where I finished the book and then like a year later we do the show.

531
00:33:45,358 --> 00:33:45,920
Scott: this book is big.

532
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,493
Scott: Yo, yeah, and it's not that I don't I read slow.

533
00:33:48,513 --> 00:33:49,920
Scott: I'm actually read way fast.

534
00:33:50,021 --> 00:33:50,483
Scott: I just don't.

535
00:33:51,006 --> 00:33:53,340
Scott: I go home and I watch something else instead of reading.

536
00:33:53,822 --> 00:34:02,259
Scott: I've been reading but what I've been to my new thing is that since my iPad died actually You know, I used to when I go to bed I would you know iPad until I went to sleep.

537
00:34:02,883 --> 00:34:15,083
Scott: But now since my iPad is gone and not getting a new one till it comes out Hopefully iPad Pro comes out and that's not just a rumor You know, I've been reading only books and comics before going to bed instead of Ipad.

538
00:34:15,163 --> 00:34:17,335
Rym: Oh books say yeah books like that book.

539
00:34:17,496 --> 00:34:18,020
Scott: Yeah that book.

540
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:23,400
Rym: Okay, as long as you're reading that book already yesterday because I'm not that excited about finishing this book.

541
00:34:23,541 --> 00:34:26,179
Rym: So I don't want to be in a situation where I have to wait.

542
00:34:26,864 --> 00:34:28,840
Scott: You can just read any book you want while waiting.

543
00:34:29,021 --> 00:34:31,473
Rym: Yeah, the problem is well with some of these books.

544
00:34:31,795 --> 00:34:33,608
Rym: if I read a bunch of books I'll forget.

545
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:39,179
Scott: my nuanced points Shows how that tells people that the book may be forgettable or unforgettable.

546
00:34:39,562 --> 00:34:45,512
Rym: Yeah, but also like the prince of nothing like I got to read it again Run a regular basis to be able to talk about it.

547
00:34:45,552 --> 00:34:46,456
Rym: Apparently, why not?

548
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:52,623

00:36:58,801 --> 00:37:05,208
Rym: I tried to get someone from oculus on this panel because that would have been the only thing we didn't have The closes we've got.

598
00:37:05,228 --> 00:37:07,136
Scott: I guess you also don't have triple-a game developer.

599
00:37:07,156 --> 00:37:07,759
Scott: We don't need them.

600
00:37:08,201 --> 00:37:10,028
Rym: Uh, I would like to have one of them.

601
00:37:10,049 --> 00:37:16,691
Rym: I can think of two people either one of which would be great But due to corporate reasons, they probably couldn't be on it.

602
00:37:16,771 --> 00:37:19,059
Scott: Yeah, I mean, that's probably the same reason Andrew isn't on either.

603
00:37:19,401 --> 00:37:21,929
Rym: Yeah, no Andrew is also just afraid of saying something stupid.

604
00:37:21,949 --> 00:37:22,250
Rym: I think.

605
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:32,247
Scott: hey well, you know after his uh his juice incident And then on Monday August 31st at 4 p.m.

606
00:37:32,669 --> 00:37:35,075
Rym: In the Sphinx theater again Remus Scott panel.

607
00:37:35,155 --> 00:37:37,484
Scott: Yes sports are games That's right.

608
00:37:37,544 --> 00:37:40,040
Scott: Don't be disrespecting the sports just cuz you're at packs.

609
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:50,666
Scott: Yes, many self-described gamers will issue games like football or ice hockey or booze ball But you should not issue them.

610
00:37:50,806 --> 00:38:02,751
Scott: sports are games and we're gonna give you the smackdown if you try to Disports like the most perfect game on earth with just tennis and if you actually live on the west coast as opposed to you know Most of the people just fly to packs after packs.

611
00:38:03,033 --> 00:38:09,860
Rym: September 2nd in Portland I'm giving a lecture on story games game design and UX at kai-fu.

612
00:38:10,262 --> 00:38:11,810
Rym: So if you want to go see me like sure.

613
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:13,780
Scott: if ooh, what the hell is that kai-fu?

614
00:38:14,523 --> 00:38:18,219
Scott: It sounds like a martial art computer human interaction forum of Oregon.

615
00:38:19,503 --> 00:38:20,799
Scott: It's an organ specific.

616
00:38:21,622 --> 00:38:24,220
Scott: It's like I guess there is a lot of software development going on in Oregon.

617
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,104
Rym: Yeah, it's an academic.

618
00:38:25,124 --> 00:38:26,933
Rym: So I'm Mike Sellecker the guy who runs PAX dev.

619
00:38:26,993 --> 00:38:28,440
Rym: He's lecturing like the week before me.

620
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,373
Scott: I think oh this thing happens more than once this.

621
00:38:31,393 --> 00:38:33,080
Rym: well, this is a lecture series.

622
00:38:33,361 --> 00:38:39,400
Rym: I so every week a like someone from the game industry who has something really interesting to say is in this lecture series.

623
00:38:39,802 --> 00:38:40,947
Scott: Oh, so it's not a convention.

624
00:38:40,988 --> 00:38:44,668
Rym: It's a once a week deal about yes until it ends It's like a limited engagement.

625
00:38:44,708 --> 00:38:46,440
Scott: So is it like at a school or something?

626
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,479
Rym: Yeah, so look Emily treat went before me like silica.

627
00:38:50,582 --> 00:38:52,553
Rym: These are all game designers game.

628
00:38:52,593 --> 00:38:53,579
Scott: Is there anyone I know?

629
00:38:54,381 --> 00:38:57,719
Rym: You probably know you probably know some of these people but don't recognize their names.

630
00:38:59,061 --> 00:39:01,351
Scott: Some of the little weird silhouette things look familiar.

631
00:39:01,391 --> 00:39:02,395
Scott: Is there a little silhouette for you?

632
00:39:02,596 --> 00:39:03,520
Rym: There is a little silhouette for me.

633
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:04,717
Scott: Where is it right there?

634
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:05,664
Scott: That's not.

635
00:39:05,705 --> 00:39:06,458
Scott: someone said that's okay.

636
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:09,751
Rym: Someone said that it makes me look like pendulette a little bit like a young pendulette.

637
00:39:10,313 --> 00:39:11,437
Scott: pendullette lost mad weight.

638
00:39:11,637 --> 00:39:12,239
Scott: Oh, yeah, he did.

639
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:15,729
Rym: Also, he's leaving Vegas to tour somewhere else.

640
00:39:16,191 --> 00:39:16,993
Scott: Well, he's just here.

641
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:18,016
Scott: He's coming to Broadway.

642
00:39:18,358 --> 00:39:19,120
Scott: They've done that before.

643
00:39:19,221 --> 00:39:20,286
Scott: That's not the first time they've been.

644
00:39:20,347 --> 00:39:22,760
Rym: I wonder if they'll go back to Vegas cuz they're the venue they were at.

645
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,246
Scott: I don't think they're leaving Vegas.

646
00:39:24,266 --> 00:39:26,474
Scott: They're just temporarily doing a Broadway show.

647
00:39:26,494 --> 00:39:28,729
Scott: Yeah, that show in Vegas I don't think ever ends.

648
00:39:28,992 --> 00:39:31,261
Rym: the thing is Contract.

649
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:35,595
Rym: if I were them like that resort like the place they play live in Vegas.

650
00:39:35,675 --> 00:39:44,200
Rym: I know but the place they perform Kind of Crappy and old-school compared to modern Vegas isn't every place they in Vegas like that.

651
00:39:44,301 --> 00:39:56,583
Rym: No, all the places on the new like main strip are Super modern kind of scary how well-designed they are and the place that pen and tell her at just feels really dumpy in like early 90s styling Whatever.

652
00:39:56,764 --> 00:40:00,980
Rym: Well, yeah, so I will be doing that lecture on September 2nd, and you should totally come see it.

653
00:40:01,281 --> 00:40:02,847
Rym: We will likely a video of it.

654
00:40:02,947 --> 00:40:06,059
Rym: And for once I'll have other people professionally doing all the video.

655
00:40:06,723 --> 00:40:08,170
Rym: You'll get the can we go are there?

656
00:40:08,231 --> 00:40:08,411
Scott: how?

657
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:09,276
Scott: when did this thing start?

658
00:40:09,316 --> 00:40:09,980
Scott: this start already?

659
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:11,845
Rym: Yes, we go for well are there?

660
00:40:11,946 --> 00:40:14,840
Scott: can we put the link so I can watch the already happen talks?

661
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,786
Rym: I will link to this and we'll go from there.

662
00:40:17,067 --> 00:40:24,218
Rym: All right, so we had a 4th of July party and We as always were playing a bunch of games with a bunch of friends at it.

663
00:40:24,821 --> 00:40:30,800
Rym: When you have a lot of friends over there aren't a lot of games that a lot of people can play except party games.

664
00:40:31,121 --> 00:40:35,400
Scott: Yeah, the old, you know apples to apples cards against humanity comes out.

665
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,874
Rym: Yep, and you know what those games have to play.

666
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:38,357
Scott: spot it.

667
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:48,032
Rym: But the our go-to our go-to for this party that worked out real well was mount your friends a gift from the hitman heart That has gotten a lot of play and I'm

668
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:51,989
Scott: I don't feel like I'm good at that game But every time I play it I do really fucking well.

669
00:40:52,009 --> 00:40:55,802
Scott: you do really fucking well, but in the end and he doesn't matter I'm pretty good.

670
00:40:55,843 --> 00:40:56,204
Scott: I won.

671
00:40:56,404 --> 00:40:57,749
Rym: I won that one that one.

672
00:40:57,909 --> 00:40:59,836
Rym: Yeah, that was the biggest one we'd ever played.

673
00:40:59,936 --> 00:41:01,000
Scott: one previous ones.

674
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,569
Rym: Do you have one previous ones?

675
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,200
Rym: I will give you that you were good at this game.

676
00:41:04,823 --> 00:41:06,250
Rym: And it's not the duck hunt.

677
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:07,415
Scott: It's like assembly programming.

678
00:41:07,476 --> 00:41:08,300
Scott: It's like in my mind.

679
00:41:08,862 --> 00:41:10,228
Scott: I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

680
00:41:10,308 --> 00:41:21,320
Rym: But when I go to do it somehow it's like oh It's interesting seeing which of our friends are good at it Which of our friends are not because it's not the people you'd expect be good or not good at it.

681
00:41:21,381 --> 00:41:23,420
Scott: No, it's like someone to be like the master of fighting games.

682
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,899
Scott: It's like whoa, they're so good at video games and you play mount your friends and it's like dirt.

683
00:41:27,563 --> 00:41:30,840
Rym: But then so Conrad and Joe were like, whoa, you should install jackbox games.

684
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,215
Rym: I was like what like you don't know jack like those old games shit from the 90s.

685
00:41:35,375 --> 00:41:39,191
Rym: Yeah, he was like, yeah There's a thing on steam just install it.

686
00:41:39,532 --> 00:41:41,300
Scott: So Rym you'd never played any of these ever before.

687
00:41:41,501 --> 00:41:55,155
Rym: I've always known about you don't know jack and I just never gave a shit because I Had my fill of party trivia quizy kinds of games Like when I was a little kid and in high school when these were popular.

688
00:41:55,175 --> 00:41:58,337
Rym: I was in quiz ball I had I was doing that like in a

689
00:41:59,042 --> 00:42:12,478
Scott: Thing with you don't know Jack is I played it in the 90s and we would sit around someone's computer Right with with like a 14-inch monitor and we all you everyone have like a button on the keyboard that's their button for ringing in or whatever and stuff like that.

690
00:42:12,498 --> 00:42:17,099
Scott: and Even though it was sort of like it was like a really trivia party game.

691
00:42:17,662 --> 00:42:22,680
Scott: But the things that made it kind of more awesome were that it wasn't just straight-up trivia like Trivial Pursuit.

692
00:42:22,781 --> 00:42:25,920
Scott: It was clever trivia and really interesting trivia.

693
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:34,120
Scott: so even though if you weren't winning or whatever you were either learning or Being fascinated and it wasn't really a lot of internet in those days if there was any at all as AOL days.

694
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:44,329
Scott: Yeah, so, you know, it's like you could you know a cat picture like oh my god Not that I had cat pictures in it and You know, it was sudden.

695
00:42:44,369 --> 00:42:45,940
Scott: you could play in that party atmosphere.

696
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:52,520
Scott: But also this the polish of the game itself graphics and sound wise with the narrator with his cover.

697
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:57,116
Scott: I think they have the same narrators even since the old days even in this new one.

698
00:42:57,156 --> 00:42:59,043
Scott: I think it's the same person It sounds the same.

699
00:42:59,124 --> 00:43:07,678
Scott: Yeah, and it's like just the way they talk and you know The whole presentation of it really makes you feel like you're on a professional game.

700
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:08,039
Scott: show it.

701
00:43:08,341 --> 00:43:17,731
Scott: You know if you can't actually go on the Family Feud, but if you can get your whole family to play You don't know jack game together You're basically you feel like you're on the real double.

702
00:43:17,751 --> 00:43:18,593
Scott: dare something at home?

703
00:43:18,614 --> 00:43:23,332
Rym: double dare can't do so Way back to kind of frame all of this.

704
00:43:23,432 --> 00:43:24,778
Rym: why we're talking about this?

705
00:43:24,798 --> 00:43:26,402
Rym: is We?

706
00:43:26,463 --> 00:43:34,113
Rym: what we had said was that the GameCube was like the height of Nintendo's Interesting innovation in that they had that Game Boy link cable.

707
00:43:34,133 --> 00:43:35,579
Scott: Mm-hmm and that they underused.

708
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:48,388
Scott: Yes They only use everything that they've invented except the only things they haven't underused are the concept of a portable console the touchscreen the analog stick and The two screens of the DS.

709
00:43:48,529 --> 00:43:50,195
Scott: that's the only things they haven't underused.

710
00:43:50,255 --> 00:43:55,852
Scott: everything else they've invented They've underused so I guess also the button and the d-pad.

711
00:43:56,073 --> 00:44:06,476
Rym: that was that was an idea that they never capitalized on other than Final Fantasy crystal chronicles and Or swords and for source and verse and pac-man verse three only three games three kinds.

712
00:44:06,837 --> 00:44:09,947
Rym: quite a right So they never.

713
00:44:09,967 --> 00:44:13,263
Rym: you know, the DS should be able to connect to the Wii and do that But it just fucking doesn't.

714
00:44:13,323 --> 00:44:14,527
Rym: and they've never done any of this.

715
00:44:14,968 --> 00:44:23,175
Scott: and I gave up even just make fucking poker where it's Texas Hold them on the TV is the table and in your 3ds in your hand.

716
00:44:23,195 --> 00:44:24,440
Scott: You can see your hand.

717
00:44:24,721 --> 00:44:33,550
Scott: Yeah, it's even just that just straight-up poker that any card game You're bugging, you know, the concert just but user.

718
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:42,667
Rym: the concept of everyone having their own screen That they can see is a killer app for like Thousands of game ideas.

719
00:44:43,149 --> 00:44:46,080
Scott: Yep, and there's all these game ideas are completely untapped.

720
00:44:46,180 --> 00:45:27,033
Scott: so I've known for a while being a you know programmer that is technologically feasible to either have a server running somewhere a web server is you could use it not web server also or Something running on an HD PC doesn't really matter and then Everyone on their phone or laptop or tablet Connecting such that you could do the same kind of game where on your TV communal screen is one thing and on everyone's individual device is their personal hidden information and you can make games like this, but I've never seen anyone do it or Do it well Until now.

721
00:45:27,498 --> 00:45:29,939
Rym: Yep So we've seen people do like SMS or whatever.

722
00:45:30,502 --> 00:45:36,100
Rym: This thing just fucking worked to the to a point that I was pretty intoxicated because it was a big party.

723
00:45:36,505 --> 00:45:50,939
Rym: So I like install this game I'm gonna play it and I just sort of hit go and not only did it just work But it just worked requiring eight people to individually go to their phone and do a bunch of shit, right?

724
00:45:50,999 --> 00:45:57,154
Scott: So Technologically, it's I'm pretty sure this is how it works is you run the application.

725
00:45:57,194 --> 00:45:59,420
Scott: It's actually a local Windows app.

726
00:45:59,541 --> 00:46:05,660
Scott: Yeah, it's a game right in Steam But you can actually just run the app on someone's phone to get it from the App Store or something.

727
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,484
Scott: So you run this app.

728
00:46:06,905 --> 00:46:08,653
Scott: the app connects to the server.

729
00:46:08,673 --> 00:46:10,079
Scott: that's in the cloud somewhere, right?

730
00:46:10,781 --> 00:46:15,160
Scott: So you have really, you know, and it's connecting with like this one API.

731
00:46:15,442 --> 00:46:21,180
Scott: So it gets the information that needs to be public Meanwhile on the server in the cloud.

732
00:46:21,401 --> 00:46:24,860
Scott: So like when they're when this game could disappear one day if they take their server down.

733
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:33,319
Rym: Yeah, because my steam server my steam game will go to the server and say I need a new game Right, and then the server gives it like here's the code for your game right now.

734
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:42,440
Scott: Yeah so you go on your phone and go to the website and You type in the code and then it knows aha this person typed in this code.

735
00:46:42,541 --> 00:46:46,820
Scott: They belong to this game And so that's how everyone joins the game as they type in the shared code.

736
00:46:47,061 --> 00:46:49,551
Rym: But we're even everyone communicates with this server.

737
00:46:49,591 --> 00:46:53,831
Scott: that synchronizes everyone and uses web sockets Yep to communicate with all your devices.

738
00:46:53,991 --> 00:46:55,780
Rym: that is key because it's web sockets.

739
00:46:56,241 --> 00:47:02,160
Rym: It's pretty much just live like you're just connected to a web socket is basically a way to trick a web browser.

740
00:47:02,562 --> 00:47:06,340
Scott: Not trick it but the way to make a web browser have a TCP IP connection.

741
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:08,167
Scott: You can just send data across arbitrarily.

742
00:47:08,307 --> 00:47:10,616
Scott: Yeah, you know, you can just play quake over a web socket.

743
00:47:10,877 --> 00:47:11,218
Scott: Whatever.

744
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:15,353
Rym: Yep So it's what got me was that it just worked.

745
00:47:15,936 --> 00:47:24,036
Rym: It was super responsive Like way like real-time like I put in an answer and the screens immediately makes the noise or whatever.

746
00:47:24,076 --> 00:47:24,457
Rym: like it was.

747
00:47:24,798 --> 00:47:25,340
Scott: it was fast.

748
00:47:25,461 --> 00:47:29,645
Scott: Yeah, like it worked it helped that everyone was on the same Wi-Fi with files But I wasn't.

749
00:47:29,705 --> 00:47:31,031
Rym: most people were not connected to the wire.

750
00:47:31,051 --> 00:47:32,196
Scott: You're using your phone phone.

751
00:47:32,256 --> 00:47:33,120
Rym: I was using my phone phone.

752
00:47:33,281 --> 00:47:33,622
Rym: Oh, wow.

753
00:47:33,783 --> 00:47:37,500
Rym: Also, we had just changed the Wi-Fi password because the router had just caught fire.

754
00:47:38,082 --> 00:47:40,711
Rym: So a lot of people were not connected to the Wi-Fi didn't matter.

755
00:47:40,751 --> 00:47:41,333
Rym: totally worked fine.

756
00:47:41,373 --> 00:47:42,056
Scott: I was on the Wi-Fi.

757
00:47:42,076 --> 00:47:45,914
Rym: Yeah, so it was really amazing.

758
00:47:45,935 --> 00:47:54,386
Rym: and Basically, if you have friends who come over and everyone people have smartphones or literally any device with a web browser Yeah, any tablet will work.

759
00:47:54,426 --> 00:47:54,707
Rym: fine.

760
00:47:54,868 --> 00:48:00,189
Rym: anything with a web browser that has an internet connection It has to be a web browser that does support web sockets.

761
00:48:00,209 --> 00:48:08,900
Scott: Yeah, I think someone had an old phone and it actually said on their screen Sorry, your browser doesn't support website, but I don't think you can use like the 3ds browser.

762
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,090
Scott: There is also a 3ds has a web browser.

763
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:12,154
Rym: There's also an app.

764
00:48:12,194 --> 00:48:13,480
Rym: So I think you could use the app even.

765
00:48:13,601 --> 00:48:15,680
Scott: Yeah, I think I saw the app in the App Store.

766
00:48:15,841 --> 00:48:18,080
Scott: I think you can use the app to actually run the game.

767
00:48:18,481 --> 00:48:24,319
Scott: So you could like install the app on an iPad use the iPad as the communal device and then everyone sits around the iPad with their phones.

768
00:48:25,642 --> 00:48:29,100
Scott: Or you can use the video out from the iPad to the TV or who knows what right?

769
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:33,399
Scott: Or send the screen of the iPad to the TV with an Apple TV.

770
00:48:33,921 --> 00:48:35,426
Rym: So the games it has.

771
00:48:35,607 --> 00:48:37,974
Rym: it doesn't have a lot in it, but it has only play.

772
00:48:38,195 --> 00:48:39,880
Scott: so we browse through the games.

773
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:43,800
Scott: But we only played two of them that were recommended and that supported eight players.

774
00:48:43,881 --> 00:48:47,303
Scott: Some of the other ones don't support so it's got regular old You don't know Jack?

775
00:48:47,343 --> 00:48:51,259
Rym: the same thing that's existed since I was a little kid up to four players.

776
00:48:52,482 --> 00:48:59,927
Rym: The three that are two that are up to eight players Which is like the sweet spot for this game because eight people is a good number of people to play a game at a party Like this.

777
00:49:00,029 --> 00:49:02,511
Rym: Oh, yeah Fibbage, which is the lion game.

778
00:49:02,894 --> 00:49:03,940
Scott: So as we played that one

779
00:49:04,522 --> 00:49:05,444
Rym: Drawful which is

780
00:49:05,485 --> 00:49:05,765
Scott: played

781
00:49:05,785 --> 00:49:06,949
Rym: on a dictionary basically

782
00:49:06,969 --> 00:49:07,450
Scott: that too

783
00:49:07,751 --> 00:49:10,459
Rym: and then word spud, which is basically just the match game

784
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:10,941
Scott: Mmm,

785
00:49:11,603 --> 00:49:20,319
Rym: and then the last one which takes up to a hundred players looks like a light version of the fibbage one lice water, okay, it's a bit because you know.

786
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:25,240
Rym: Realistically, yeah, these games could have large numbers of players.

787
00:49:25,603 --> 00:49:33,640
Rym: practically, you've got to Minimize the interaction and minimize how much the game blocks on someone not taking their turn quickly.

788
00:49:34,283 --> 00:49:36,616
Rym: That's why only one of the game supports 100 players.

789
00:49:37,903 --> 00:49:38,607
Scott: So fibbage.

790
00:49:38,667 --> 00:49:41,260
Scott: the way fibbage works is it shows a sentence on the screen?

791
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:47,199
Scott: Like with a question or a sentence with a blank in it or whatever and everyone lies and makes up an answer.

792
00:49:47,219 --> 00:49:55,900
Scott: you make up an answer that you want people to Believe is the right answer But you don't want it to be the right answer.

793
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:57,466
Scott: It has to be a false answer.

794
00:49:57,607 --> 00:50:05,700
Scott: then after everyone has submitted their false answers By the way, if you type in the right answer, it will tell you that you're right and make you type something else.

795
00:50:07,141 --> 00:50:12,759
Scott: Then it will show all of the answers that people submitted as well as the real answer.

796
00:50:13,061 --> 00:50:13,545
Scott: Protip.

797
00:50:13,585 --> 00:50:15,680
Rym: if you can't spell you're never gonna win this game.

798
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:16,282
Rym: Do you have to?

799
00:50:16,322 --> 00:50:21,859
Scott: so so from the get-go regardless of being clever and I'm coming up with something good to type in.

800
00:50:22,541 --> 00:50:34,200
Scott: You want to a type something in in a way that looks like the way the game would phrase the answer Right and spell it properly and punctuate it the way the game does so it fits in with the other answer.

801
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:37,659
Scott: Is it like if you use camel case or you know?

802
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:41,732
Scott: Do something weird or use a word that probably the game wouldn't use?

803
00:50:41,793 --> 00:50:44,662
Scott: it sort of stands out and people like that's obviously not The right answer.

804
00:50:45,364 --> 00:50:47,329
Scott: so then you choose which answer.

805
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:51,080
Scott: once they're all displayed you choose which one you think is the correct answer.

806
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:53,932
Scott: You might know the correct answer because you typed it in in the first place.

807
00:50:54,534 --> 00:50:55,699
Scott: But yeah, just choose that one.

808
00:50:56,664 --> 00:51:05,520
Scott: Anyone who chooses the right answer gets a bunch of points and Anyone who has their false answer chosen by someone else gets a bunch of points.

809
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:13,684
Scott: yep, straight-up party game and then you get score and then you just keep doing this and the points increase and the questions get crazier and Then someone wins.

810
00:51:13,784 --> 00:51:14,889
Rym: Yep, and then the draw.

811
00:51:14,909 --> 00:51:17,300
Rym: the one is basically just Pictionary like.

812
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:33,499
Scott: So it tells you to you know, tell one person to draw something So you draw it and then people try to guess what it is Right, it seemed yeah, but everyone's kind of drawn a picture and it comes down to.

813
00:51:34,301 --> 00:51:36,871
Rym: People can't draw like no one can draw.

814
00:51:36,932 --> 00:51:38,980
Rym: None of our friends can draw especially not on your iPhone.

815
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,168
Rym: Yeah, like even the artist.

816
00:51:40,188 --> 00:51:41,900
Scott: and it doesn't doesn't let you erase either.

817
00:51:42,121 --> 00:51:47,660
Rym: Yeah, so even the artists who normally like in a real-world Pictionary situation would be great.

818
00:51:48,245 --> 00:51:52,571
Rym: They were severely Constrained by the way this you get one color.

819
00:51:52,652 --> 00:51:54,039
Scott: Everyone has their own color to draw in.

820
00:51:54,281 --> 00:51:58,060
Scott: Yep, and the things it gives you to draw I had the worst possible.

821
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:00,169
Scott: I the first like the concept of hope.

822
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:02,540
Scott: the first thing it told me to draw was family values.

823
00:52:03,363 --> 00:52:04,620
Scott: And it's just like are you fucking kidding?

824
00:52:06,562 --> 00:52:08,070
Scott: How am I supposed to draw family values?

825
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:13,460
Scott: if you said family matters I go to draw on an Urkel But you said family values what the hell am I supposed to do?

826
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:21,564
Rym: So the moral of all this I mean we don't need to review party games in depth is that this thing is Really legit.

827
00:52:21,845 --> 00:52:25,336
Scott: Yeah, the technology aspect of it is really what makes it happen.

828
00:52:25,377 --> 00:52:26,420
Scott: I mean, it's a party game.

829
00:52:26,561 --> 00:52:27,606
Scott: It's a good party game.

830
00:52:27,988 --> 00:52:30,140
Scott: You could you know, you could have this party game going on.

831
00:52:30,261 --> 00:52:32,840
Scott: Just you know, even without any technology.

832
00:52:33,266 --> 00:52:38,414
Scott: but having the Technology just made it so much easier for people to jump in if we brought this.

833
00:52:38,474 --> 00:52:42,769
Scott: if he busted this out like as a board You know, it would be like an e-poop you cat.

834
00:52:42,869 --> 00:52:45,036
Scott: only some people go to it and some people don't.

835
00:52:45,377 --> 00:52:48,220
Scott: the fact that it's on The TV it grabs the center of attention.

836
00:52:48,684 --> 00:52:50,520
Scott: People are sitting around on their phones.

837
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:53,530
Scott: Suddenly you're sitting around on your phones together.

838
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:56,700
Scott: that really brings everyone in no problem.

839
00:52:56,901 --> 00:53:01,416
Rym: And the thing is it's the barest minimum effort once the technology is there.

840
00:53:01,496 --> 00:53:02,500
Scott: the technology is there.

841
00:53:03,042 --> 00:53:10,506
Scott: I just I just learned how to do a really good pattern for writing a web socket Application the other day.

842
00:53:10,526 --> 00:53:12,596
Scott: Oh, there's a really great video.

843
00:53:13,118 --> 00:53:13,560
Scott: It's awesome.

844
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:14,745
Scott: So I can make these.

845
00:53:15,086 --> 00:53:18,319
Scott: but here's I just need someone to do the front-end part to make it look nice.

846
00:53:18,882 --> 00:53:26,115
Rym: The game design part of this like these games are so great The barest effort was put into the game design side.

847
00:53:26,155 --> 00:53:27,439
Rym: That's not even the hard part.

848
00:53:28,142 --> 00:53:36,285
Rym: it amazes me that no one's really done this until now, so What I say to you out there Give up on Nintendo.

849
00:53:36,385 --> 00:53:41,000
Rym: They have had the technology to do this on Nintendo consoles since the GameCube era.

850
00:53:41,402 --> 00:53:48,790
Rym: They have squandered that they will never make use of multiple screens That all that multiple people are holding.

851
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:50,236
Rym: ignore Nintendo.

852
00:53:50,296 --> 00:53:51,080
Rym: give up on them.

853
00:53:51,481 --> 00:53:54,972
Rym: I mean Smash Brothers doesn't even work that well in local multiplayer.

854
00:53:54,992 --> 00:53:56,356
Scott: You just make wizard with this.

855
00:53:56,777 --> 00:54:02,800
Scott: Yeah Yeah We should just make to prove the tech that we can make the technology happen as well.

856
00:54:03,001 --> 00:54:05,509
Rym: Yeah, maybe we should just as a proof of concept.

857
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:08,480
Rym: and then all we have to do is sit down and design.

858
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:09,021
Rym: You know you do.

859
00:54:09,062 --> 00:54:15,760
Rym: you design like ten games that are at least as designed as fibbage and drawful and BAM.

860
00:54:16,041 --> 00:54:18,269
Rym: You've just made something amazing.

861
00:54:18,289 --> 00:54:20,296
Scott: Yeah, so we try to make wizard for this.

862
00:54:20,357 --> 00:54:23,217
Rym: Yeah We should license that art.

863
00:54:25,661 --> 00:54:28,980
Scott: I'll just scan them in and use them and then in our in our proof of concept.

864
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:29,891
Rym: Yeah, just to make it work.

865
00:54:29,952 --> 00:54:32,871
Scott: and then you know If anyone wants to make it look nice, they can just replace all those.

866
00:54:33,535 --> 00:54:35,503
Rym: So I'm sorry Nintendo It's just you.

867
00:54:35,803 --> 00:54:37,267
Rym: this was you were here.

868
00:54:37,588 --> 00:54:41,599
Rym: You had this and you never let it be what it was born to be.

869
00:54:47,794 --> 00:54:50,330
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

870
00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:55,210
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.
