00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:13,369
Rym: It's Monday, November 30th, 2015.

2
00:00:13,369 --> 00:00:14,292
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,452 --> 00:00:19,448
Rym: I'm scared and this is GeekNights tonight Talking about headphone jacks.

4
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:20,332
Scott: This is rooms.

5
00:00:20,372 --> 00:00:22,319
Rym: I did TRS and all that biz.

6
00:00:24,661 --> 00:00:25,677
Rym: Let's do this.

7
00:00:27,525 --> 00:00:37,372
Rym: So today, I'm you know my building is for elevators for work like the office just for like our elevator bank because it's a tall building and There's a lot of semi public businesses on it.

8
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:38,880
Rym: So people use it off and on throughout the day.

9
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:49,738
Rym: But today like 11 I went down and did some stuff and I go to take the elevator back up and there's a woman Standing there like waiting for the elevator, but she has not hit the button to go up.

10
00:00:50,582 --> 00:00:58,580
Rym: So fine, so I go and hit the button and then she turns me and says Excuse me, sir, and already I'm like, oh, why is she tell who's this person?

11
00:00:58,740 --> 00:00:59,403
Rym: Why are they talking to me?

12
00:00:59,423 --> 00:01:02,112
Rym: and she's like are you riding the elevator up?

13
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:07,935
Rym: and I'm like, yes I'm riding this elevator up and she's like what floor are you going to?

14
00:01:07,956 --> 00:01:12,860
Scott: and I'm Part of me is thinking maybe why do I have to tell you where I'm going?

15
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,210
Rym: maybe I should not respond because this is like crazy person.

16
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:24,049
Rym: bells are going off, but well-dressed not a hobo like Yeah, yeah, but seriously there is it's New York.

17
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:33,060
Rym: the reality is if someone reeks of urine and starts asking you stuff It's very yeah, but just cuz you don't speak of your it doesn't mean it doesn't mean oh, you don't pull the shields down.

18
00:01:33,101 --> 00:01:34,499
Scott: I'm not telling you where I'm going.

19
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,960
Rym: You do not put the shields down just because someone doesn't reek of urine, but you might actually respond to the hail.

20
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:45,776
Rym: So I'm like, I'm going up to the 16th floor and she's like, oh, okay.

21
00:01:46,037 --> 00:01:46,800
Rym: I'm going to 15.

22
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,605
Rym: Can I ride with you?

23
00:01:47,626 --> 00:01:50,562
Rym: and I'm like, uh Guess.

24
00:01:51,364 --> 00:02:10,699
Rym: so the elevator comes and I get in and I wait for her to hit 15 and I hit 16 And then she starts explaining to me that she won't ride elevators alone because she's afraid to Okay, so instead I guess she waits for the first stranger who comes by and decides to get in the elevator with him.

25
00:02:11,484 --> 00:02:14,140
Scott: You don't have to ask you can just wait for them to go in the elevator.

26
00:02:14,261 --> 00:02:16,591
Rym: I think she was worried that what if she got in with me and I did?

27
00:02:16,892 --> 00:02:24,598
Rym: she kind of explained this and I went to A lower floor than her cuz then I would abandon her so she'd have to get off in the same floor I got off on but that would be weird.

28
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,596
Scott: You could get over it and deal with.

29
00:02:29,636 --> 00:02:35,700
Rym: yeah I don't know what aspect because she's afraid of being alone in the elevator.

30
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:36,407
Rym: So I joked.

31
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:42,137
Rym: I was like, well, you know Elevators are pretty safe like once you're in if it's not like someone else can get in when they're between floors.

32
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:43,304
Rym: and she's like You don't know that.

33
00:02:43,807 --> 00:02:45,758
Rym: and then I was like, yeah shields are back up.

34
00:02:49,441 --> 00:02:50,125
Rym: It's kind of like hers.

35
00:02:50,507 --> 00:02:51,290
Rym: it reminds me of.

36
00:02:51,331 --> 00:02:53,160
Rym: I learned that there are actually people who have it.

37
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,139
Rym: There's an app for this too, but people have a job of hanging out.

38
00:02:56,401 --> 00:03:00,540
Rym: You know that bridge by the water gap down in Delaware that we used to take all the time.

39
00:03:00,752 --> 00:03:01,442
Scott: Yeah I know that bridge.

40
00:03:01,643 --> 00:03:07,877
Rym: so there are people who are so afraid to ride in cars over that that they hire people to drive them Over that and they like sit in the back and cry.

41
00:03:07,917 --> 00:03:09,644
Rym: I guess Like that is the thing.

42
00:03:09,684 --> 00:03:10,186
Rym: There's a job.

43
00:03:10,206 --> 00:03:13,580
Rym: You can have a drive people's cars over that bridge for them every day.

44
00:03:16,261 --> 00:03:22,740
Rym: Yeah, so I wonder if I could get a job hanging around in my elevator Lobby riding the elevator with people as an escort.

45
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:32,340
Scott: Uh What they should do is you just push the person the elevator and close the door Be like, uh, I guess you're free of elevators.

46
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,492
Scott: There's a self-fulfilling Prophecy would have been funnier if you never would have said anything.

47
00:03:36,512 --> 00:03:39,566
Scott: you could have written the elevator normally like everyone else But because you were afraid.

48
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,355
Scott: well now you're gonna have to suffer.

49
00:03:41,476 --> 00:03:42,240
Rym: you don't think about this too.

50
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:42,944
Rym: It's just like.

51
00:03:42,984 --> 00:03:44,091
Scott: this is why you.

52
00:03:44,151 --> 00:03:45,580
Scott: it's just like with your annoying noises.

53
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:49,600
Scott: It's like well now that we know that noise annoys you guess what's gonna happen?

54
00:03:49,902 --> 00:03:51,010
Rym: I think you learn one noise.

55
00:03:51,051 --> 00:03:54,760
Rym: that doesn't annoy me but This is why you were not a proper troll.

56
00:03:54,820 --> 00:04:04,292
Rym: This is why I am a schooled troll from the olden times and why I really feel bad about how this word has been denigrated Because a proper troll would have agreed to this woman's request.

57
00:04:04,352 --> 00:04:06,540
Rym: pushed five got into the elevator with her.

58
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,848
Rym: No, not just gotten off hit 16.

59
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:11,740
Rym: She hits 15. wait until the door is just about to close.

60
00:04:12,282 --> 00:04:20,375
Rym: Jump through it not tripping the sensor that would reopen the door So that she is suddenly trapped on her own without having been touched or shoved in any way.

61
00:04:20,536 --> 00:04:25,634
Rym: because if you shove her you were An asshole, but simply getting out of an elevator does not make one an asshole.

62
00:04:25,654 --> 00:04:27,079
Rym: that makes one a troll.

63
00:04:27,219 --> 00:04:28,242
Scott: Oh shit I forgot my coat.

64
00:04:28,584 --> 00:04:31,553
Rym: Yeah, that's even better if you make a polite excuse.

65
00:04:31,934 --> 00:04:33,520
Rym: So now she has no excuse.

66
00:04:35,381 --> 00:04:41,516
Rym: So yeah, that was my morning and I thought about this all day because that was it was the weirdest thing that's happened to me in some time.

67
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:42,475
Scott: Uh-huh.

68
00:04:43,581 --> 00:04:46,900
Scott: What weirder thing is I hope she was taking the elevator to like the psychologist office.

69
00:04:47,262 --> 00:04:49,254
Rym: There is one but it's on the 16th floor.

70
00:04:49,274 --> 00:04:50,220
Scott: Isn't that where she went?

71
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,887
Rym: No, she went to the 15th floor.

72
00:04:52,229 --> 00:04:53,234
Rym: fuck if I know what's down there.

73
00:04:53,254 --> 00:04:54,420
Rym: It looks identical to my floor.

74
00:04:54,581 --> 00:04:56,128
Scott: So why doesn't she just use stairs?

75
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,660
Rym: You can't take the stairs up in my building only down.

76
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,102
Scott: Why not?

77
00:04:59,423 --> 00:05:00,749
Rym: because they're locked one way.

78
00:05:00,769 --> 00:05:01,411
Rym: Whoa.

79
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:03,400
Scott: Yeah, you can use the stairs my building all you want.

80
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:04,969
Rym: I know I wish you could use the stairs in my building.

81
00:05:04,989 --> 00:05:08,820
Scott: I complained and the response I gotta take the stairs to the 16th floor.

82
00:05:08,901 --> 00:05:12,931
Rym: I talked to the super and I asked like hey Like could we set it up so we can take the stairs up during the day?

83
00:05:13,233 --> 00:05:18,840
Rym: and his response was to raise his eyes And look at me not respond and then look back down at his palate.

84
00:05:20,002 --> 00:05:21,755
Rym: So that was how far I got on that one.

85
00:05:21,775 --> 00:05:24,727
Scott: You should be like Alright, obviously there's some reason.

86
00:05:24,747 --> 00:05:25,651
Scott: you think that that's stupid.

87
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:26,877
Scott: Can you please tell me that reason?

88
00:05:26,897 --> 00:05:29,058
Rym: Yeah Yeah, I don't think he wanted me to talk to him.

89
00:05:30,062 --> 00:05:31,698
Scott: fine, I'm gonna go and talk to my.

90
00:05:32,683 --> 00:05:38,164
Rym: Go through, you know, the the building manager, but he basically is like there's no one above him I can talk to.

91
00:05:38,184 --> 00:05:39,511
Scott: he's collecting your rents.

92
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:43,970
Rym: I'm actively but As great Scott get a building downtown.

93
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,678
Rym: It's not like your fancy midtown.

94
00:05:48,563 --> 00:05:49,749
Scott: If I talk to the guy he's just like.

95
00:05:49,769 --> 00:05:50,352
Scott: hey, how's it going?

96
00:05:50,432 --> 00:05:51,980
Rym: So do you have any tech news?

97
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,313
Rym: Anything to talk about in the first bit of the show this Monday?

98
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,539
Rym: No, no nothing.

99
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:02,545
Scott: We already did an episode that I don't give a shit and I'm find myself somehow even just a week later You've been giving less of a shit.

100
00:06:03,188 --> 00:06:04,513
Scott: All right, two weeks later.

101
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:06,160
Scott: So there is no tech news.

102
00:06:06,682 --> 00:06:07,484
Rym: First things first.

103
00:06:07,765 --> 00:06:10,012
Rym: I'm thinking about building a new HTTP see.

104
00:06:10,313 --> 00:06:14,528
Rym: cuz my HTTP see is on its last legs I just upgraded mine to Windows 10.

105
00:06:14,528 --> 00:06:16,355
Rym: I did that a long time ago.

106
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,660
Scott: Well, it just got the notification.

107
00:06:17,761 --> 00:06:18,505
Scott: I didn't do.

108
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:19,591
Scott: I didn't push it, right?

109
00:06:19,732 --> 00:06:22,708
Scott: Yeah, I made it for the notification So and I had free time.

110
00:06:22,748 --> 00:06:27,039
Scott: finally on this, you know the weekend so Thanksgiving afterwards anyway.

111
00:06:28,485 --> 00:06:29,479
Scott: So, I mean it's kind of slow.

112
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,067
Scott: It's only i3 and the.

113
00:06:31,489 --> 00:06:39,357
Scott: the low profile video card is weak So it can only play rocket league on like you have the GTX 460. no, it's an AMD whatever.

114
00:06:39,377 --> 00:06:40,540
Scott: I think it's actually 80.

115
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,163
Scott: I don't even know.

116
00:06:41,264 --> 00:06:45,322
Rym: It's it's whoa something cuz I have a low profile, but it's a GTX 460.

117
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:46,671
Rym: Like it is a real video car.

118
00:06:46,752 --> 00:06:47,900
Scott: Anyway, it's a real video card.

119
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,442
Scott: It's just old.

120
00:06:48,483 --> 00:06:51,255
Scott: so I mean it can play rocket league on low settings, you know, it's fine.

121
00:06:51,918 --> 00:07:06,440
Scott: But uh, You know I don't do really too much 3d gaming on there and you can use the steam stream for all kinds of games with really fancy And it has no problem like power wise like playing HD videos or streaming HD videos or anything like that.

122
00:07:06,822 --> 00:07:08,350
Scott: The only slowness is the storage.

123
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:12,548
Scott: it took a long time to upgrade to Windows 10 Yeah, and mine takes a long time to boot.

124
00:07:12,869 --> 00:07:22,799
Scott: SSDs are way cheap right now with the sales, especially I saw 250 something gigabyte SSDs for like 80 bucks or like 200 gig ones for like 50 bucks.

125
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,931
Scott: It's like there's a new egg in Amazon.

126
00:07:24,951 --> 00:07:25,233
Scott: You can get.

127
00:07:25,353 --> 00:07:26,520
Scott: SSDs are way cheap right now.

128
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:26,881
Scott: I saw 120 120 for $34.

129
00:07:26,881 --> 00:07:28,486
Rym: Yes, like I thought about buying one, but I'm like, you know what?

130
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,205
Scott: Why spend any money?

131
00:07:34,225 --> 00:07:36,820
Scott: because it's still just it's still getting the job done.

132
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,049
Rym: Yeah, that's that's exactly where I went to.

133
00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:47,515
Scott: because I because my problem is that it's like oh no It's a little bit slow when I have to read some files But usually it's reading files over the network and not over the and I'm not doing that.

134
00:07:47,636 --> 00:07:52,738
Rym: often the games I play on it all work fine is mostly emulation and like necro dancer and things like that.

135
00:07:52,758 --> 00:07:55,800
Rym: Yeah It's slow to reboot but I don't.

136
00:07:56,141 --> 00:07:58,591
Scott: You can still mount your friends like a die.

137
00:07:58,772 --> 00:08:05,960
Rym: Yeah, the booting is slow big deal Yeah, but lately it's a recent thing and I have not updated the driver.

138
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,853
Rym: The video card will just crash and flip out.

139
00:08:09,893 --> 00:08:11,920
Scott: I think that's Nvidia driver because I'm my desktop.

140
00:08:12,022 --> 00:08:14,646
Rym: Oh, but this was a not Also happens.

141
00:08:14,807 --> 00:08:16,033
Rym: This was not happening before.

142
00:08:16,113 --> 00:08:17,359
Scott: there a recent driver update.

143
00:08:17,379 --> 00:08:22,475
Scott: with your Apply the driver update you switch from Windows 7 to Windows 10.

144
00:08:22,475 --> 00:08:30,432
Rym: Yeah But when I switched to Windows 10 this didn't happen for a long time and then it started happening Like I mean mine happens about once every month or two.

145
00:08:30,452 --> 00:08:32,520
Scott: There's a like Nvidia driver has crashed.

146
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,558
Scott: I think it happened actually a couple weeks ago with some sieve.

147
00:08:35,102 --> 00:08:40,400
Rym: So, uh, I think I'm gonna dust it and reseat everything and see if that goes away.

148
00:08:40,822 --> 00:08:43,599
Scott: I was doing some research on dusting while looking also at the deals.

149
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,432
Scott: Apparently, you know a lot of people like canned air is just poison chemicals.

150
00:08:48,513 --> 00:08:50,640
Scott: It's not actually compressed air and a can whatever.

151
00:08:50,941 --> 00:08:53,347
Rym: Yeah, I know that open the window when you use it.

152
00:08:53,387 --> 00:08:58,060
Scott: guys like yeah, but they're like no environment some hippie, whatever.

153
00:08:59,281 --> 00:09:00,426
Scott: So I'm like, well, what's your alternative?

154
00:09:00,446 --> 00:09:04,482
Rym: you're gonna buy a air compressor like just compressed air depending on how you do It could.

155
00:09:04,523 --> 00:09:06,034
Rym: it could introduce static issues.

156
00:09:06,095 --> 00:09:06,498
Scott: Sure, right?

157
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,342
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

158
00:09:07,362 --> 00:09:12,040
Scott: is you don't use an air compressor you got it, right and they're like, this is product on Amazon.

159
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:15,577
Scott: That's like the hurricane something or tornado or something like that.

160
00:09:15,637 --> 00:09:19,019
Scott: where it's like, yeah You just battery-powered it blow and it you know, whatever.

161
00:09:19,582 --> 00:09:22,737
Scott: Apparently if you read the reviews like it's a total it's a total bullshit.

162
00:09:22,837 --> 00:09:23,340
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

163
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,553
Rym: I go through about a can of air every two years.

164
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:26,560
Rym: So I think that's okay.

165
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,343
Scott: Yeah, I just bought.

166
00:09:27,363 --> 00:09:31,981
Scott: I went on Amazon to buy the cans of air and you know what one can was $10.

167
00:09:31,981 --> 00:09:32,342
Rym: Let me guess.

168
00:09:32,362 --> 00:09:36,035
Scott: two cans was like $11 to pack was like 30.

169
00:09:36,035 --> 00:09:42,651
Scott: Oh, so I bought two one-pack Hahaha 20 which is deeper than the two-pack.

170
00:09:43,073 --> 00:09:46,267
Rym: So what I'm looking into now is There's two ways I can go.

171
00:09:46,287 --> 00:09:46,608
Rym: Basically.

172
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:51,477
Rym: I'm gonna run this HD PC until it dies But I'm done with ATX.

173
00:09:51,920 --> 00:10:04,552
Rym: I'm either gonna get a micro ATX in the shoebox form factor instead of the VCR form factor Because the shoebox cases can have a full-size video card on a micro ATX Motherboard.

174
00:10:04,572 --> 00:10:04,973
Rym: Mm-hmm.

175
00:10:05,335 --> 00:10:10,870
Scott: So I'm done with but if you just rotate that video card somehow 90 degrees You can't though because it's not like the old days.

176
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:15,644
Rym: You could put like giant risers out of your motherboard and not affect performance like risers.

177
00:10:15,685 --> 00:10:17,510
Rym: fuck shit up now because things are fast.

178
00:10:17,771 --> 00:10:21,730
Scott: I think you know, there's a company ZOTAC that specializes in making small computers.

179
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:28,090
Scott: Yeah, they make some pretty good shoebox form factor But I think I might just buy like a complete system for them when the time comes.

180
00:10:28,631 --> 00:10:35,139
Rym: So the other thing I was looking at if I am confident that I can get away with not having take a look at the Next packs.

181
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:44,606
Rym: They always have a booth Yeah but not having a real and video video card like if I'm if I'm comfortable that I can get away with like Even a core i7 on you just use the steam stream.

182
00:10:44,646 --> 00:10:45,210
Scott: It totally works.

183
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,877
Rym: Yeah in that case I might get a core i5 or even it.

184
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,123
Rym: like you can get a cheap i7.

185
00:10:49,163 --> 00:10:59,089
Rym: if you go with like lower numbers of cores And do the end the Intel onboard video and get a micro ITX and you get this tiny tiny tiny little thing.

186
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:02,630
Rym: Because I don't really need the DVD playing capabilities anymore.

187
00:11:02,951 --> 00:11:06,950
Rym: So I don't which actually is the biggest thing other than the video card.

188
00:11:08,031 --> 00:11:12,309
Rym: So I might just make like the tiniest PC for my HD PC and be done with it.

189
00:11:12,711 --> 00:11:17,130
Scott: Let's just let me go to packs South as let's just check on the ZOTAC.

190
00:11:17,215 --> 00:11:23,865
Rym: Yeah Cuz if you're willing to go down the road of micro ITX The pre-built systems are probably better put together than anything.

191
00:11:23,885 --> 00:11:25,190
Rym: You're gonna build yourself at that point.

192
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,730
Scott: What are you gonna do if you build it yourself?

193
00:11:26,911 --> 00:11:30,746
Scott: Yeah, I'm gonna buy a bunch of stuff from ZOTAC and put it in a box and we're clumsily than they do.

194
00:11:30,926 --> 00:11:34,338
Rym: Yep, exactly But the answer is not what.

195
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:35,565
Scott: do they have any competitors?

196
00:11:35,585 --> 00:11:36,510
Scott: Like I just know them.

197
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:43,050
Scott: I don't actually know if they're any good I just know of them, you know, they compete with bad solutions like roku's or smart TVs or Xboxes.

198
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:45,238
Scott: so there has to be someone else to make small computer bits.

199
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:54,379
Rym: because if you guys didn't realize there's a lot of YouTube videos and Content that just don't show up if you don't have a real HD PC Like stuff's just not there when you search.

200
00:11:54,761 --> 00:11:55,944
Rym: I've been doing research on that.

201
00:11:56,686 --> 00:12:01,950
Rym: So in other news Amazon, you know people a lot of people have been poo-pooing Amazon's drone delivery.

202
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,685
Rym: But and you know Amazon had their little prototype.

203
00:12:04,705 --> 00:12:11,110
Rym: people like that's cute But it's fake and pretty much most industry people and normal people say that seems like something too far in the future.

204
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:11,918
Scott: That won't happen.

205
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,847
Rym: So Amazon are Driving cars and then Amazon was like, uh, yeah, we got one that works.

206
00:12:18,188 --> 00:12:18,670
Rym: Here it is.

207
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:24,870
Rym: Here's video of it 15 mile range delivering real packages like for real autonomously.

208
00:12:25,272 --> 00:12:27,527
Rym: regulation is holding us back not technology.

209
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:30,117
Rym: and Actually, it looks pretty cool.

210
00:12:30,177 --> 00:12:32,170
Scott: Are you within 15 miles of an Amazon warehouse?

211
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:35,929
Rym: If I were Amazon, well 15 miles Scott hope it takes me.

212
00:12:36,472 --> 00:12:40,206
Scott: I'm like nine miles because I know there's an Amazon warehouse like in Jersey somewhere.

213
00:12:40,246 --> 00:12:41,330
Scott: Oh, no, that's a new egg warehouse.

214
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:44,955
Rym: I'm whatever miles away from my office downtown.

215
00:12:45,196 --> 00:12:45,778
Scott: yeah, I'm like.

216
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:51,809
Rym: so you could put platforms on top of like Four buildings in Queens and cover all the parts of Queens that matter?

217
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:56,369
Scott: No, but I'm saying is that you need to have the has to start at the warehouse or the goods are?

218
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:57,152
Rym: well No, you have that.

219
00:12:57,172 --> 00:13:01,970
Rym: you still have trucks delivering probably from the warehouses to like distribution centers.

220
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:06,410
Rym: But instead of having that big-ass truck, you know go to a bunch of little trucks.

221
00:13:06,711 --> 00:13:08,761
Rym: The big-ass truck goes to a distribution center.

222
00:13:08,962 --> 00:13:10,490
Rym: that then goes to a whole bunch of little drones.

223
00:13:10,571 --> 00:13:12,450
Scott: So what do you do people throwing rocks at the drone?

224
00:13:13,511 --> 00:13:15,365
Rym: We'll solve that by just making it a crime.

225
00:13:15,385 --> 00:13:17,796
Rym: I Actually the rock problem.

226
00:13:17,917 --> 00:13:20,025
Scott: is there a way to trick the thing and to deliver?

227
00:13:20,085 --> 00:13:20,446
Scott: I see you got.

228
00:13:20,607 --> 00:13:23,299
Scott: you know, normally it's like Okay, it's got to land in my house.

229
00:13:23,741 --> 00:13:24,545
Scott: What if I'm not home?

230
00:13:24,585 --> 00:13:25,530
Scott: Is it ringing my doorbell?

231
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,283
Rym: Oh, yeah, and you know what the the problem is.

232
00:13:28,323 --> 00:13:29,410
Rym: we could do a whole show on that.

233
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:30,876
Scott: It's gonna land on my balcony.

234
00:13:31,017 --> 00:13:32,463
Scott: Is it gonna figure that out now?

235
00:13:32,644 --> 00:13:33,850
Scott: Can I help it figure that out?

236
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:42,110
Rym: The problem is every time any tech blog is snowing any podcast any slash dot shithead talks about this topic.

237
00:13:42,631 --> 00:13:53,626
Rym: They'll ask questions like Scott's asking but they'll act like no one at Amazon ever thought of these things like yeah It's like they're like, oh I found this problem that you didn't already answer.

238
00:13:53,646 --> 00:13:55,793
Scott: I'll assume it's Unanswerable.

239
00:13:55,813 --> 00:13:57,317
Scott: there is no solution.

240
00:13:57,478 --> 00:13:59,243
Scott: I'm therefore this could never happen.

241
00:13:59,283 --> 00:14:03,508
Rym: I got this crazy idea for a horseless carriage but but what if?

242
00:14:04,453 --> 00:14:06,059
Rym: What if horses are still on the road?

243
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,626
Scott: I mean it has a power from somewhere.

244
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:08,630
Scott: Where does it get power from?

245
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:10,417
Rym: Yeah, what did you think of that?

246
00:14:10,598 --> 00:14:13,330
Scott: Yeah, what do you it's like, you know feed it like a horse you feed.

247
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,034
Scott: Hey, it's like.

248
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:15,602
Rym: yeah, I invented the horseless carriage.

249
00:14:15,683 --> 00:14:16,809
Rym: I've figured all that stuff out.

250
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:20,980
Scott: So there's no gas stations yet.

251
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,059
Scott: How you gonna get that again out?

252
00:14:25,119 --> 00:14:26,828
Scott: in New York, there's only gas station around.

253
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:35,910
Rym: yeah I'm confident that Amazon has people whose sole job is to sit there all day Thinking about all the things that could go wrong with delivery drones.

254
00:14:36,719 --> 00:14:37,569
Rym: That probably a fun job.

255
00:14:38,354 --> 00:14:40,586
Rym: Actually, just sit there and be like what is it?

256
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:41,270
Rym: X happens?

257
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:44,647
Scott: That's a fine job if I didn't have to sit there for more than 40 hours a week.

258
00:14:44,768 --> 00:14:48,401
Rym: Yeah So, uh, what other?

259
00:14:48,481 --> 00:14:50,675
Rym: oh, yeah, so this is a cool thing I'm just going through.

260
00:14:50,695 --> 00:14:52,846
Rym: all my tech news is garbage technique.

261
00:14:53,228 --> 00:15:00,710
Rym: formula E is a racing scene that pretty much no one except like super car nerds knows anything about or super nerd nerds, right?

262
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:01,432
Scott: It's like the bet.

263
00:15:01,493 --> 00:15:08,700
Scott: basically, you know, there's Formula One which is the best and then the best But also problematic for everything is all.

264
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,844
Scott: racing is problematic.

265
00:15:10,265 --> 00:15:16,635
Scott: But Formula E is like, alright fine We'll make another league, you know another racing, you know Championship.

266
00:15:16,675 --> 00:15:28,349
Scott: Yeah, where there's electric cars And basically instead of charging the batteries in the middle of the race you pull in and you jump the driver jumps out of the Car and jumps in the second already charged car.

267
00:15:28,932 --> 00:15:30,217
Scott: Otherwise the race wouldn't be long enough.

268
00:15:30,437 --> 00:15:31,160
Rym: now the problem with.

269
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,650
Rym: well one of the problems with this all this kind of racing is that?

270
00:15:34,891 --> 00:15:38,362
Rym: You can't do a lot like there's a limiting factor in a lot of car racing.

271
00:15:38,743 --> 00:15:40,870
Rym: that's the human and the safety concerns.

272
00:15:41,432 --> 00:15:44,904
Scott: So Formula E was basically a lot of rules in Formula One that are pretty much like.

273
00:15:45,165 --> 00:15:46,690
Scott: you can't do this because you kill people.

274
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:51,497
Scott: They're even thinking about making include, you know, it's open wheel, you know It's open wheel open cockpit racing

275
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:54,630
Rym: and there's a lot of reasons for that for like competitiveness and whatever

276
00:15:55,891 --> 00:16:02,790
Scott: They're considering like closing the cockpit on Formula One cars for safety reasons like put a little glass dome over your head or something.

277
00:16:03,172 --> 00:16:05,809
Rym: Yeah, so Formula E was just like, you know what?

278
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:10,054
Rym: robot League Robot League.

279
00:16:10,356 --> 00:16:10,617
Scott: Yep.

280
00:16:10,717 --> 00:16:12,304
Scott: No more humans driving these cars.

281
00:16:12,344 --> 00:16:13,670
Scott: We'll let the cars drive themselves.

282
00:16:14,513 --> 00:16:16,803
Rym: Well, then so there I mean, we don't know the full time.

283
00:16:16,824 --> 00:16:18,290
Scott: He's not asking a bunch of stupid questions?

284
00:16:18,391 --> 00:16:31,510
Rym: I assume there's no answer for I Am excited for the idea of this show because then Formula One and other kinds of racing can showcase more like team tactics the human factors in the face of limitations.

285
00:16:32,133 --> 00:16:34,606
Rym: Formula E could go crazy.

286
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,749
Rym: redline Nonsense, that's what I'm saying.

287
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:42,370
Rym: Like the cars could have guns on if we wanted to like that could tell you got to worry about the spectator safety still.

288
00:16:42,622 --> 00:16:45,319
Rym: Yeah they solve that in all the movies about this.

289
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:52,616
Scott: that also if you put guns on the cars it stops being less about racing more about Yeah, bad fighting but more like.

290
00:16:52,656 --> 00:16:52,857
Rym: so.

291
00:16:52,897 --> 00:16:59,757
Rym: ground-effects cars like f1 cars could be way way faster And we made they were way fast.

292
00:16:59,797 --> 00:17:02,205
Scott: Yeah ground-effects cars not even ground effects.

293
00:17:02,225 --> 00:17:02,907
Scott: We used to have like v10s.

294
00:17:05,914 --> 00:17:11,839
Rym: These things could have all of that and Even better if it's AI versus AI.

295
00:17:12,563 --> 00:17:17,023
Rym: a lot of people only watch f1 For highlights to see when crazy shit happens.

296
00:17:17,506 --> 00:17:22,460
Rym: a bunch of AI's Reacting in real time in souped up dangerous electric cars.

297
00:17:22,962 --> 00:17:30,166
Rym: crazy shit might go down like on a minute by minute basis Like the AI might just do something stupid eventually, but the thing is right.

298
00:17:30,246 --> 00:17:41,410
Scott: like all sports You're gonna approach like, you know maximum efficiency pretty rapidly if there's enough investment and you're just gonna see every car achieving It's maximum, you know lap time.

299
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:46,630
Scott: It's its shortest possible race time and whichever one is the shortest possible race time will win.

300
00:17:46,871 --> 00:17:59,662
Rym: However, I will say this if AI gets advanced enough to where every car on the road is Driving perfectly in there won't be a situation where the car that gets the pole and The qualifying won't also win the race.

301
00:17:59,723 --> 00:18:01,070
Scott: It got around the track fastest.

302
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,719
Scott: It can continue to get around like.

303
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,202
Scott: imagine this.

304
00:18:03,222 --> 00:18:04,490
Rym: so say two of the AI cars.

305
00:18:04,991 --> 00:18:10,690
Rym: I have perfect knowledge of the perfect line and the fastest speed but one of them is in front of the other one.

306
00:18:11,052 --> 00:18:13,148
Scott: How did it get there if the other one was faster to begin with?

307
00:18:13,951 --> 00:18:14,493
Rym: So yeah, how?

308
00:18:14,714 --> 00:18:16,060
Rym: how do you do anything in f1?

309
00:18:16,121 --> 00:18:20,425
Rym: I mean right now in f1 you have the qualifications So they might be off like a microsecond.

310
00:18:20,506 --> 00:18:21,089
Scott: human errors.

311
00:18:21,502 --> 00:18:21,730
Rym: Yeah.

312
00:18:22,051 --> 00:18:23,114
Rym: So maybe a IRS.

313
00:18:23,495 --> 00:18:30,008
Rym: if we get AI that is perfect at this and there are no differentiating factors between them You get really boring.

314
00:18:30,452 --> 00:18:38,802
Scott: But that also means we have solved a lot of really complicated problems solved how to make a car go around a track as fast as possible.

315
00:18:39,043 --> 00:18:53,240
Rym: if the AIs are so perfect that the competition is Meaningless and comes down to random factors in Formula E with a eyes down the road That means that self-driving cars are the literal reality of the entire rest of the world At least the industrialized world at least rich people in the industrialized world.

316
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:56,490
Rym: Hmm, but I'm looking forward to what actually comes out of this.

317
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:57,373
Rym: So stay tuned.

318
00:18:57,574 --> 00:18:58,658
Scott: Yeah, I'm gonna watch every race.

319
00:18:58,999 --> 00:19:00,324
Scott: Yeah, the cars that drive themselves.

320
00:19:00,384 --> 00:19:01,890
Scott: I'm watching every race every second.

321
00:19:02,233 --> 00:19:03,346
Rym: So I got one little thing here.

322
00:19:04,031 --> 00:19:13,484
Rym: Unicode, you know is the way you should be encoding text nowadays for a lot of reasons and Unicode has a lot of like smiley faces and things in it.

323
00:19:13,524 --> 00:19:14,790
Rym: There's a lot of characters in there.

324
00:19:14,971 --> 00:19:16,501
Scott: Yeah, because they've got so much space.

325
00:19:16,521 --> 00:19:17,790
Scott: They've already put all the human languages.

326
00:19:18,212 --> 00:19:21,430
Scott: So and emojis and emoticons are used by a lot of people.

327
00:19:21,571 --> 00:19:23,140
Scott: So why not put them in there?

328
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,770
Scott: and they have been and it's been really helpful.

329
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:31,409
Rym: Yeah It is really useful that I positive thing I can type an emoji on my Android phone and pretty much anyone.

330
00:19:31,751 --> 00:19:38,910
Rym: I send that message to on a phone a computer depending on their font anywhere in the world The symbol is transferred but not the graphic.

331
00:19:39,213 --> 00:19:48,390
Rym: So if Scott's on iPhone He's like angry cat guy looks a little bit different from my angry cat guy because the character is just defined as angry cat guy.

332
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:51,441
Scott: Yeah, and your font determines what it actually looks like.

333
00:19:51,762 --> 00:19:52,906
Rym: So there's a consortia.

334
00:19:52,987 --> 00:19:53,790
Scott: all the normal letters.

335
00:19:53,970 --> 00:20:03,574
Rym: yeah, there is a consortia like Unicode is just like an example of a lot everything that is both good and overly bureaucratic with Technology standards.

336
00:20:04,316 --> 00:20:08,690
Rym: and there's a problem that has emerged that a lot of people never anticipated only recently.

337
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:15,990
Rym: Companies like Nestle are trying to petition the consortium that decides what characters get.

338
00:20:16,111 --> 00:20:16,656
Scott: That's a good thing.

339
00:20:16,676 --> 00:20:18,270
Scott: The consortium isn't a commercial entity.

340
00:20:18,471 --> 00:20:25,290
Rym: Yeah with commercial interest to add their own trademarks and advertisements as Unicode characters.

341
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:29,001
Rym: No, so Nestle wants a Kit Kat emoji.

342
00:20:29,302 --> 00:20:31,750
Rym: Taco Bell wants a Taco Bell taco emoji.

343
00:20:32,211 --> 00:20:33,335
Rym: Durex wants a condom.

344
00:20:33,355 --> 00:20:36,504
Rym: but supposedly well, I mean, I just want a generic condom.

345
00:20:36,745 --> 00:20:37,287
Rym: I do need.

346
00:20:37,367 --> 00:20:38,711
Scott: I'm okay with that Durex You're good.

347
00:20:38,772 --> 00:20:39,334
Scott: Yeah, you're good.

348
00:20:39,635 --> 00:20:43,009
Scott: But if Durex wanted a also Taco Bell, I think there's already a bell.

349
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:47,058
Scott: so And if there's also a taco that's fine too.

350
00:20:47,078 --> 00:20:48,683
Scott: You can just go taco it followed by Bell.

351
00:20:48,964 --> 00:20:50,850
Rym: So here's my word Nestle.

352
00:20:51,031 --> 00:20:52,223
Scott: I think it's already a chocolate bar.

353
00:20:52,283 --> 00:20:52,909
Scott: So shove it.

354
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:53,652
Rym: Here's my worry.

355
00:20:53,773 --> 00:21:06,460
Rym: if you think that most people are don't care enough about local politics get involved that People who have too much power are involved and are controlling local politics Less people care about this than you can imagine.

356
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:11,395
Scott: the people who care about this are also the people who care about The clocks being one second off.

357
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:16,994
Rym: more people know who Bernie Sanders and Lawrence Lessig are Combined.

358
00:21:17,256 --> 00:21:19,790
Rym: then even know that there's a Unicode consortium.

359
00:21:24,991 --> 00:21:26,935
Rym: You're a rare unicorn Scott.

360
00:21:27,356 --> 00:21:29,602
Scott: so my worry is there a unicorn emoji?

361
00:21:29,682 --> 00:21:36,502
Rym: that consortium could probably be taken over by shady commercial interests trivially if people actually tried and that's bad news.

362
00:21:36,983 --> 00:21:48,201
Rym: and even if it isn't if these Pollutes that space the can of worms that opens is beyond Comprehension we're gonna have to replace Unicode with something else.

363
00:21:48,643 --> 00:21:57,289
Rym: Let's say I send a message I tweet something with the emoji for I don't know coca-cola like a coke a can of coca-cola.

364
00:21:57,751 --> 00:22:04,625
Rym: But I say hey wanna Pepsi Coca-cola would have to send me a trademark.

365
00:22:04,705 --> 00:22:09,378
Rym: C and D or Risk losing their rights to the trademark.

366
00:22:09,398 --> 00:22:18,066
Scott: I make a font and there's one of the characters is letter a another one Is the letter B things which are not owned by anybody and the third one is and the third one is 2012, right?

367
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:25,990
Scott: So I have to make when I'm making my font a graphic for Ron Paul 2012, but I decide to make it a poop.

368
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:28,699
Rym: So, I think that is the solution.

369
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,327
Rym: it'd be we'll keep an eye on this.

370
00:22:30,367 --> 00:22:33,644
Rym: believe me I'm one of the people who will know if this shit happens.

371
00:22:34,226 --> 00:22:41,710
Rym: if it happens I call on everyone who makes fonts everyone who supports you anyone who makes any emoji arts any emoji?

372
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:49,498
Rym: That is a trademark Hans should always be interpreted as a middle finger Or a poop or a middle finger and a I think.

373
00:22:49,518 --> 00:22:53,070
Rym: but yeah poop is better because middle finger isn't culturally universal.

374
00:22:53,691 --> 00:22:54,513
Rym: Poops pretty you know.

375
00:22:54,553 --> 00:22:56,719
Scott: or a poop with a trademark that T.M.

376
00:22:56,779 --> 00:22:57,080
Scott: Or goatee.

377
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:11,885
Rym: Oh Anyway things of the day.

378
00:23:11,905 --> 00:23:12,610
Rym: what do you got for me?

379
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:16,170
Scott: So, you know in Manhattan, it's not easy to get real estate.

380
00:23:17,171 --> 00:23:20,144
Scott: It's not even easy to rent even if it's commercial real estate.

381
00:23:20,204 --> 00:23:20,867
Rym: Well, it's got you.

382
00:23:20,887 --> 00:23:21,410
Rym: So guess what?

383
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:25,080
Rym: Lakehole is gone can't couldn't afford the couldn't afford the rent.

384
00:23:25,281 --> 00:23:28,650
Rym: Yeah, $100 plus a table a head table restaurant.

385
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,846
Scott: Well, there's a cook shortage I heard but that's a different story.

386
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:45,494
Scott: Yeah But surprisingly in Manhattan, there's a lot of things that manage to stick around And seem to be unable to get pushed out despite the fact that rents go up and they're usually things that have some special way Of staying where they are.

387
00:23:46,036 --> 00:23:49,630
Scott: things like a church right as some special way to stay where it is.

388
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:50,554
Scott: Maybe it's a landmark.

389
00:23:50,855 --> 00:23:54,110
Scott: Maybe someone just owns the property and it's not like renting.

390
00:23:54,452 --> 00:24:01,567
Rym: There's a great article about why Chinatown still exists Even though that real estate is worth like a hundred times what it's being used for.

391
00:24:01,587 --> 00:24:03,455
Scott: Yep Things like that.

392
00:24:03,555 --> 00:24:04,458
Scott: So, you know theaters.

393
00:24:04,719 --> 00:24:07,550
Scott: they stay, you know, like even though theaters are making money anyway.

394
00:24:08,475 --> 00:24:20,121
Scott: And one of the things that tends to stay or like museums But also these really like specialized in tiny museum type thing Always go around and you'd be like what the hell is that.

395
00:24:20,201 --> 00:24:24,696
Scott: and it's like this really tiny thing and it's like oh That's the Museum of gangsters.

396
00:24:24,756 --> 00:24:25,138
Rym: Yeah.

397
00:24:25,158 --> 00:24:31,016
Scott: Yep, and it's this tiny little thing and somehow it you know, no one goes to it But it keeps that spot and it just stays there.

398
00:24:31,498 --> 00:24:42,930
Scott: So another thing related to the museums are these libraries like these very specific Libraries like you'll see them if you walk around just like Christian Science Library and I think that partially uses the church exception.

399
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:44,860
Scott: Yeah, also Christian Science is bullshit.

400
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,845
Scott: It's nothing to do with science.

401
00:24:46,247 --> 00:24:46,890
Scott: Yeah away from that.

402
00:24:49,451 --> 00:24:51,199
Scott: Not as bad as Scientology but bad.

403
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,550
Scott: yeah, it's as bad as Seventh-day Adventist bad.

404
00:24:53,811 --> 00:24:57,182
Scott: Yeah, you're better off just going to Catholic Church or whatever than going there.

405
00:24:57,363 --> 00:24:58,366
Rym: Why not the orthodoxy?

406
00:24:58,587 --> 00:24:59,370
Scott: sure you can go there, too.

407
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:01,278
Scott: It's better better than Christian Science.

408
00:25:01,419 --> 00:25:02,022
Rym: Oh see man.

409
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,890
Scott: Christian Science is all like don't take medicine.

410
00:25:06,472 --> 00:25:08,922
Scott: But anyway, you'll also see ones like.

411
00:25:08,962 --> 00:25:13,320
Scott: I think there's like a Swedish like Specific like library kind of thing.

412
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,509
Scott: I saw ones, you know, you see stuff like that.

413
00:25:15,951 --> 00:25:24,100
Scott: but there's one I did not know about probably cuz I never walked past where it is and It is called the conjuring arts Resource Center.

414
00:25:24,241 --> 00:25:25,183
Rym: Wait a minute.

415
00:25:25,203 --> 00:25:26,326
Rym: That sounds Lovecraftian.

416
00:25:26,346 --> 00:25:33,170
Scott: It is a library that contains 11,000 books about magic and its Allied arts.

417
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:39,190
Rym: Whoa, if I if high school Rym had found that place high school Rym would have applied to work there.

418
00:25:40,031 --> 00:25:47,149
Scott: Right, so apparently that's there and Yeah, so I didn't know it was there.

419
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:56,280
Scott: but if you need to study magic don't go to the regular library go to the magic specific library and you could learn some cups And balls or some son lady in half or worse.

420
00:25:56,541 --> 00:25:58,648
Rym: That is actually super awesome.

421
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:00,997
Scott: Yeah Usually, I don't know.

422
00:26:01,078 --> 00:26:07,710
Scott: sometimes these I don't know how this one works A lot of them work differently like sometimes you can go in and read all you want, but you can't take anything out.

423
00:26:08,152 --> 00:26:10,104
Scott: Sometimes you got to be a member to even walk in.

424
00:26:10,205 --> 00:26:10,889
Scott: so they're all you know.

425
00:26:11,118 --> 00:26:16,732
Scott: Yeah I guess you can go to their website and get some infos if you actually want to go there and you're in Manhattan and you Care about magic.

426
00:26:16,792 --> 00:26:17,354
Rym: I'm going there.

427
00:26:17,374 --> 00:26:18,558
Scott: What are you gonna learn there?

428
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:19,381
Scott: I don't know magic.

429
00:26:19,682 --> 00:26:20,686
Scott: You're gonna learn magic.

430
00:26:21,147 --> 00:26:21,790
Scott: What are you gonna learn?

431
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,504
Scott: I know magic magic missile.

432
00:26:23,929 --> 00:26:30,890
Rym: I Dude, can you hope you know how much damage 1d 4 plus 1 is on a human a level zero commoner?

433
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,067
Rym: That's death for most people.

434
00:26:34,213 --> 00:26:34,956
Scott: All right, well they're not.

435
00:26:34,996 --> 00:26:35,257
Scott: they're not.

436
00:26:35,318 --> 00:26:36,301
Scott: obviously not letting you in.

437
00:26:36,984 --> 00:26:38,329
Rym: magic missile never misses either.

438
00:26:40,251 --> 00:26:47,546
Rym: Anyway, so I have a quote to you for you But from an article about the video that is my thing of the day.

439
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,196
Rym: quote the battery pack.

440
00:26:50,297 --> 00:27:00,250
Rym: living inside this thing is a literal pack of rechargeable double-a batteries soldered and taped together into an amalgam of electricity and regrets.

441
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:05,290
Scott: So first of all, if you don't realize this already, you know when you get a battery pack.

442
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:10,730
Scott: It's like batteries come in cells the same way that your double A's and your C's and your all your trip.

443
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,441
Rym: I like you buy a little bit laptop battery.

444
00:27:12,461 --> 00:27:15,192
Rym: It'll say like this is the six cell Cell.

445
00:27:15,374 --> 00:27:17,004
Scott: take your laptop battery and open it up.

446
00:27:17,064 --> 00:27:17,849
Rym: Don't do that.

447
00:27:18,691 --> 00:27:20,018
Rym: Okay, don't actually open it.

448
00:27:20,099 --> 00:27:24,719
Scott: But yeah, but if you if you opened it up, you know It's in there a bunch of batteries all end-to-end.

449
00:27:24,739 --> 00:27:27,630
Scott: Yeah in rows and they look like normal batteries.

450
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:32,150
Scott: They're just usually like solid color and full of lithium and yep, but they're like tested together.

451
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:36,690
Rym: They're embedded in like usually some sort of like heavy usually some circuit board controlling them, right?

452
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:37,012
Scott: You're not.

453
00:27:37,314 --> 00:27:39,670
Scott: it's not like when you put a double-a battery in your TV remote.

454
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:42,785
Scott: The double-a battery is going right into your remote, but there is you.

455
00:27:42,805 --> 00:27:43,489
Rym: there's like a power.

456
00:27:44,353 --> 00:27:45,699
Rym: Well, there's there's something there.

457
00:27:45,739 --> 00:27:48,070
Scott: There's some sort of capacitor regulator kind of thing.

458
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:48,897
Rym: Yeah, but it's not.

459
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:57,230
Scott: when you have a battery pack Usually, you know, there's some sort of circuit board in between all those cells and your laptop right inside the battery.

460
00:27:57,391 --> 00:28:05,489
Rym: This is a dude who just does like teardowns like he'll take apart technology and be like, hey here's the thing and I'm gonna take it apart and tear it down and tell you how it worked.

461
00:28:05,509 --> 00:28:10,070
Rym: and He has these ones about like embedded computers and tablock tablet computers and whatever.

462
00:28:10,873 --> 00:28:12,449
Rym: But this video is kind of special.

463
00:28:12,971 --> 00:28:19,050
Rym: This is like a specialized tablet computer that was sold as a product for people to use in a professional setting.

464
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:28,050
Scott: Yes, I mean we already know that like medical devices and medical can you know are like the worst the asinomad Infoview medical tablet computer.

465
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:34,770
Rym: I guess it was used in hospitals for medical data and doctors and nurses and things and probably starting fires.

466
00:28:35,211 --> 00:28:38,262
Rym: Probably so he does his usual thing.

467
00:28:38,322 --> 00:28:40,770
Rym: Like he's opening this thing and he's like, oh, well, there's a board like this.

468
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:44,143
Rym: There's a board like this and this video increasingly goes off the rails.

469
00:28:44,244 --> 00:28:45,710
Scott: I laughed so hard at work.

470
00:28:46,251 --> 00:28:48,559
Rym: It's like this is a dog's breakfast.

471
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:50,004
Rym: is what we got in here like.

472
00:28:50,024 --> 00:28:54,048
Rym: he cannot believe What is going on in here and he finds?

473
00:28:54,913 --> 00:28:58,650
Rym: Bad cells like, you know the kinds of cell like, you know, those cells God was talking about.

474
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:04,011
Rym: They kind of look like a regular like double-a battery, but they're not a regular double-a battery Like you.

475
00:29:04,031 --> 00:29:14,190
Rym: don't just put those in something now and he has soldered them together and wrapped tape around them Like jumbled in like laying on top of the motherboard.

476
00:29:14,571 --> 00:29:21,476
Rym: There's like two of them and then there's a third one like off somewhere else, but he keeps saying like oh, there's a battery pack There's a normal battery pack.

477
00:29:21,797 --> 00:29:22,641
Rym: and then this bullshit.

478
00:29:23,022 --> 00:29:28,403
Rym: and as he's getting deeper and deeper into this thing He starts getting more and more suspicious of that quote battery pack.

479
00:29:29,145 --> 00:29:32,745
Rym: and when he opens it This video is just great.

480
00:29:34,758 --> 00:29:35,782
Rym: This is also why.

481
00:29:35,883 --> 00:29:37,350
Scott: so keep in mind when you go to the hospital.

482
00:29:37,451 --> 00:29:39,325
Scott: This is the sort of equipment your life depends upon.

483
00:29:39,708 --> 00:29:48,107
Rym: Yep this is the kind of equipment that I used to have to deploy in hospitals, which is why I Quit that job and burned every bridge I had as I walked out the door.

484
00:29:48,147 --> 00:29:49,372
Rym: flip it everybody Burn it.

485
00:29:49,392 --> 00:29:50,616
Scott: This is gonna burn itself.

486
00:29:50,636 --> 00:29:54,650
Rym: Yeah, all I did was leave in a cenomed tablet computer on the bridge.

487
00:29:57,091 --> 00:29:59,604
Rym: In the moment the book club book was the wheel of time.

488
00:29:59,664 --> 00:30:00,709
Rym: I just read the fifth book.

489
00:30:01,186 --> 00:30:03,870
Scott: I Started reading the fifth book and I haven't read any in a long time.

490
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:07,710
Scott: You could probably listen to GeekNights' episodes and figure out when I started and stopped reading that fifth book.

491
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:09,060
Rym: We'll start a new book club book.

492
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,310
Rym: That isn't the wheel of time soon.

493
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:11,675
Rym: I actually know what it's gonna be now.

494
00:30:12,317 --> 00:30:16,070
Rym: that book that we talked about on the last interview show we did.

495
00:30:17,313 --> 00:30:18,018
Rym: You remember that book?

496
00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:19,569
Rym: no sounded like a really good book.

497
00:30:20,292 --> 00:30:24,065
Scott: Okay, maybe I'm remembering a bit now with Joe with Joe food.

498
00:30:24,105 --> 00:30:24,326
Rym: Yeah.

499
00:30:24,487 --> 00:30:24,988
Rym: Yeah that one.

500
00:30:25,029 --> 00:30:25,831
Rym: That's the book I'm gonna do.

501
00:30:25,872 --> 00:30:26,715
Rym: I think okay.

502
00:30:26,936 --> 00:30:30,450
Rym: So otherwise, we're gonna be at magfest on a bunch of panels.

503
00:30:31,551 --> 00:30:32,494
Rym: They're not public yet.

504
00:30:32,554 --> 00:30:34,622
Scott: I got to arrange all kinds of transportation.

505
00:30:35,244 --> 00:30:43,147
Rym: if you back us on patreon I posted a preview of the panels were likely to be on even though that's not otherwise generally public information.

506
00:30:43,187 --> 00:30:43,649
Rym: So there you go.

507
00:30:44,451 --> 00:30:46,418
Rym: Otherwise, we're probably gonna be back south.

508
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,444
Rym: We're probably gonna be a pax east.

509
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,250
Rym: We're probably gonna be an anime Boston.

510
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,314
Rym: We're probably gonna be a ConnectiCon.

511
00:30:51,334 --> 00:30:52,459
Rym: I think that's far enough out.

512
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,970
Rym: push in July PAX Prime PAX Prime.

513
00:30:55,451 --> 00:30:56,976
Scott: That's the convention schedule for next year.

514
00:30:57,157 --> 00:30:59,465
Rym: then magfest again pecks out or pecks ass.

515
00:30:59,565 --> 00:31:00,990
Rym: We're probably gonna do pecks ass.

516
00:31:01,712 --> 00:31:03,699
Scott: I was thinking about going to Essen next year.

517
00:31:03,719 --> 00:31:04,542
Rym: I won't do both.

518
00:31:05,124 --> 00:31:05,887
Scott: I can't afford that.

519
00:31:05,907 --> 00:31:06,810
Scott: You want to give me a bunch of money?

520
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:08,514
Rym: No, why don't you patreon?

521
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:10,540
Scott: you want to like quintuple your investment?

522
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,887
Scott: Yeah, send me to Essen and packs ass.

523
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:17,860
Rym: Oh and also for our Tuesday listeners David Peterson finally posted.

524
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:26,990
Rym: we helped him and Lou Crane make a bunch of videos around the Mouse guard swords and strongholds board game the board game that the mice play in the mouse guard comics, right?

525
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:34,686
Scott: So if you had any rules questions about those games We help produce some videos that explain every conceivable possible rule scenario.

526
00:31:34,746 --> 00:31:37,757
Scott: in case you don't want to read the rules You just watch these videos instead.

527
00:31:37,898 --> 00:31:39,484
Rym: There is one scenario.

528
00:31:39,765 --> 00:31:40,930
Rym: We do not describe.

529
00:31:41,911 --> 00:31:49,652
Rym: No, we knew because we I have the video where we all talked about the scenario and agreed that there's literally no reason to explain That scenario.

530
00:31:49,833 --> 00:31:56,362
Rym: Okay, the one where what if I need to put a mouse back on the board with my rescue?

531
00:31:56,382 --> 00:32:02,676
Rym: and There's literally because there are four strongholds blocking the other side.

532
00:32:02,897 --> 00:32:04,964
Rym: There is no legal place for me to put it.

533
00:32:05,024 --> 00:32:05,927
Scott: You're already in bad shape.

534
00:32:06,168 --> 00:32:14,468
Rym: Yeah So There are always rumors about what Apple's gonna do next and you know A lot of them are just complete BS unless you know where to look.

535
00:32:15,091 --> 00:32:27,283
Rym: but the most recent rumor is one that has been a perennial rumor with Apple that they're gonna remove the headphone jack from their blank and This yeah, everyone's acting like they never heard this story before.

536
00:32:27,343 --> 00:32:28,830
Scott: we heard this story like two years ago.

537
00:32:28,891 --> 00:32:29,768
Scott: This is not a new story.

538
00:32:29,872 --> 00:32:30,492
Rym: Yeah Didn't they?

539
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:35,270
Rym: they actually put on a mini TRS jack on an iPod at one point?

540
00:32:35,772 --> 00:32:39,205
Rym: Like I remember that happening or something rumblings happening about that.

541
00:32:39,225 --> 00:32:40,390
Scott: I know I remember that ever.

542
00:32:40,974 --> 00:32:42,870
Rym: I mean iPods are ancient technology anyway.

543
00:32:42,911 --> 00:32:55,540
Rym: Yeah iPods have always had the regular headphone home, but it's actually an interesting question because the TRS standard or at least the you know The headphone jack that as you know, it is called TRS.

544
00:32:55,901 --> 00:32:56,042
Rym: Yeah.

545
00:32:56,062 --> 00:32:59,250
Rym: Well TRS is the you know tip ring shield sleeve.

546
00:33:00,453 --> 00:33:01,964
Rym: I've heard sleeve or shield in desert.

547
00:33:02,065 --> 00:33:03,051
Scott: It doesn't matter It's.

548
00:33:03,152 --> 00:33:03,293
Scott: it's.

549
00:33:03,393 --> 00:33:15,530
Scott: that's what it stands for because the plug has a tip Then this sort of black separator than a ring a metal ring Oh then another little separator and then the sleeve or the shield, right?

550
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:23,470
Scott: And then so it's these three pieces of metal and when you shove it in the socket It connects in three places to your device.

551
00:33:24,232 --> 00:33:30,510
Rym: Right and it existed because that shape was actually really easy to make and be super reliable.

552
00:33:30,731 --> 00:33:33,930
Rym: Right was really easy to connect to a very simple cable, right?

553
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:37,029
Scott: And the best thing about it is that the tip has like this indent in it.

554
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:50,287
Scott: So in the inside of your hole, there's some little pushers that push inwards and when the tip makes it past the pushers They they lock in behind the tip keeping that headphone jack sort of in there.

555
00:33:50,387 --> 00:33:51,350
Scott: pretty good, right?

556
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:51,893
Scott: It's like it's not.

557
00:33:52,074 --> 00:33:54,329
Scott: you got to you know, apply some force to yank it out.

558
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:54,771
Scott: Yeah,

559
00:33:54,811 --> 00:33:55,957
Rym: and the contacts are not

560
00:33:56,037 --> 00:34:05,015
Scott: just like a loosey, you know, that's why when you put your headphones You know into the into the hole it goes click and then it clicks to come out is because the shape of the tip and these Little pushers on the inside

561
00:34:05,075 --> 00:34:12,303
Rym: and also the contacts are real big get a really good connection there Which is important because for audio purposes, that's analog information.

562
00:34:12,342 --> 00:34:12,985
Rym: It's not digital.

563
00:34:13,005 --> 00:34:14,290
Rym: There's no error correction, right?

564
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:16,197
Scott: It's an analog audio signal.

565
00:34:16,237 --> 00:34:19,790
Scott: it can you know, it's already been amplified right to what it's gonna be.

566
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:25,753
Scott: You just need to send it to some speakers and you can hear it, you know, so it's pretty much, you know What is the speaker?

567
00:34:25,793 --> 00:34:33,670
Scott: It's a magnet that just moves back and forth, you know pushing a thing to make the air move to make Sound that's the same as a model own just in the opposite action exactly.

568
00:34:33,831 --> 00:34:40,612
Scott: So if your speaker is got, you know, if someone's creating like a you know, I don't know a hundred Hertz tone You know.

569
00:34:40,831 --> 00:34:42,916
Scott: then if you look at that electric signal, what is it?

570
00:34:43,136 --> 00:34:45,260
Scott: It's an electric wave that's going at a hundred Hertz.

571
00:34:45,641 --> 00:34:49,340
Rym: Yeah, then you make a thing move at a hundred Hertz and then it makes that sound.

572
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:50,924
Scott: That's how it works.

573
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:56,081
Scott: So when you have the tip ring and sleeve the sleeve is ground because electricity Right.

574
00:34:56,101 --> 00:35:02,124
Scott: Yeah, and the tip and ring are left and right because it's stereo Which is lossy.

575
00:35:02,445 --> 00:35:08,404
Rym: because the other way to use that kind of cable is a balanced connection where you're only sending one channel So it's mono.

576
00:35:08,846 --> 00:35:15,148
Rym: but it's actually so ethernet cables at least up through like hundred megabit They do pretty much the exact same thing.

577
00:35:15,168 --> 00:35:16,091
Rym: is what I'm about to describe.

578
00:35:16,512 --> 00:35:18,559
Rym: you send the same data over both.

579
00:35:19,423 --> 00:35:22,720
Rym: So the tip and the ring both have the same data, but you invert one of them, right?

580
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,734
Scott: So when one says one the other one says zero.

581
00:35:24,774 --> 00:35:25,500
Scott: at the same time.

582
00:35:26,202 --> 00:35:31,440
Rym: It's more like because one says thirty eight point nine seven and the other one says forty one point four five because it's analog.

583
00:35:31,621 --> 00:35:36,380
Scott: Yes, yeah, but then at the other end because they're the exact opposite of each other, right?

584
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:46,753
Rym: It's you can pretty much a hundred percent and detect any errors or mistakes Because say you add 20 to one spot because there was like a EMP went off somewhere like nukes are happening.

585
00:35:47,034 --> 00:35:59,720
Rym: an EMP went by and a plus 20 Got added to this one like microsecond in your signal at the other end You see there's a plus 20 on top of a signal on one end and there's also a plus 20 on the other end.

586
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:08,802
Scott: So basically so something that started off is negative 2. positive 2 is now Neg, you know negative it's 18 and 22.

587
00:36:08,802 --> 00:36:17,720
Rym: So you're like, aha that must have been a - yeah Because if you take the two signals and overlay them on each other they turn into zero plus all the noise.

588
00:36:17,821 --> 00:36:22,450
Rym: So basically you get a track now That is just the noise and you can remove it.

589
00:36:22,811 --> 00:36:33,260
Scott: and that is why balanced audio cables are the best thing in the world But those don't devices on either end after you actually do that and you would need like tip ring ring ring sleeve.

590
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,187
Rym: Yeah, that's why XLR cables.

591
00:36:35,468 --> 00:36:36,332
Rym: It's the same thing.

592
00:36:36,372 --> 00:36:45,446
Rym: It's just three pins instead of a tip and a ring Doing the exact same thing, but balanced audio is not used by any of you Unless you have a mixer and some audio.

593
00:36:45,486 --> 00:36:49,220
Scott: so and there's no reason to because really how much interference are you dealing with and walking?

594
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:49,882
Scott: Around none.

595
00:36:49,902 --> 00:36:51,990
Scott: Yeah, you can't hear any difference using.

596
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:55,000
Rym: Yeah, plus you've got a short cable and some shitty headphones.

597
00:36:55,423 --> 00:36:56,328
Rym: So it doesn't really matter.

598
00:36:56,348 --> 00:36:58,180
Rym: that doesn't matter if you have fancy headphones.

599
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:58,501
Rym: They don't.

600
00:36:58,561 --> 00:37:03,580
Scott: don't start believing some audiophile nonsense that you got to use balanced cables for your everyday audio listening.

601
00:37:04,182 --> 00:37:09,678
Rym: Yeah, if you're audio producing most of the time your devices don't support that anyway like you can.

602
00:37:09,979 --> 00:37:13,580
Scott: yeah So, you know, so it's an audiophile devices often don't support.

603
00:37:14,102 --> 00:37:35,868
Rym: So TRS is important though because there's some debate about this and I'm not going to weigh in on whether or not this Statement is correct, but a lot of people have posited that the TRS audio standard So that jack and that socket and that format of sending audio analog audio Might be the longest live technical Specification in consumer device history

604
00:37:36,049 --> 00:37:38,014
Scott: even old even older than like the phone jack.

605
00:37:38,235 --> 00:37:39,619
Rym: It is basically a phone jack.

606
00:37:40,221 --> 00:37:43,171
Rym: Before our modern rj11 phone jack existed.

607
00:37:43,532 --> 00:37:44,416
Scott: really it's older than rj11.

608
00:37:44,436 --> 00:37:48,628
Rym: Yeah Read the Wikipedia article on this is cut.

609
00:37:48,708 --> 00:37:49,710
Rym: It's not called TRS.

610
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:50,733
Rym: TRS is a use of it.

611
00:37:51,054 --> 00:37:52,438
Rym: It's called phone jack.

612
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,053
Scott: Oh Okay, that's news to me.

613
00:37:56,342 --> 00:38:00,698
Scott: Something else you may have noticed is that like newer headphones and newer phones and things in general.

614
00:38:00,718 --> 00:38:04,189
Scott: have Tip ring ring sleeves extra ring on there.

615
00:38:04,209 --> 00:38:06,998
Rym: There's some like T tip ring ring ring ring like.

616
00:38:07,019 --> 00:38:07,440
Rym: there's a lot.

617
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,705
Scott: I've only seen two ring.

618
00:38:08,946 --> 00:38:10,612
Scott: I've never seen anything more than two ring.

619
00:38:10,692 --> 00:38:12,158
Rym: I'm pretty sure I've seen TRRS.

620
00:38:13,143 --> 00:38:13,867
Scott: I've only seen TR.

621
00:38:13,968 --> 00:38:14,753
Rym: I'm gonna look that up.

622
00:38:14,813 --> 00:38:15,799
Rym: I see TRS here.

623
00:38:16,121 --> 00:38:18,451
Scott: So TRS is basically an extra ring.

624
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:20,420
Scott: and what do you do with that extra ring?

625
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,612
Scott: They're not doing balanced audio because it's nonsense right?

626
00:38:23,933 --> 00:38:24,475
Rym: Oh my god.

627
00:38:24,516 --> 00:38:24,977
Rym: There it is.

628
00:38:25,018 --> 00:38:25,580
Rym: There's TR.

629
00:38:26,481 --> 00:38:33,100
Scott: Okay, what they're doing with the second extra additional ring is first of all, it's fully backwards compatible with the one ring.

630
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:42,900
Scott: Right, it's like if you take a tip ring ring sleeve headphone and put it in an old iPod that only supports tip ring sleeve.

631
00:38:43,241 --> 00:38:46,834
Scott: It's gonna play just fine because it's gonna line up with either ring and it doesn't give a shit.

632
00:38:46,854 --> 00:38:50,028
Rym: and it's elegant because the way It works in the modern era.

633
00:38:50,049 --> 00:38:58,520
Rym: I mean think if you've got a mono Device just because you have like like one speaker or something You can plug a mono cable into there and it'll just work.

634
00:38:58,761 --> 00:39:05,208
Scott: It's gonna be touching both halves of the stereo part and combining them, you know Well, there's a little more.

635
00:39:05,268 --> 00:39:07,620
Scott: nor maybe you'll only hear left or maybe you'll only hear right?

636
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:16,952
Rym: I do not want to get into what happens there because actually with old devices you could kill yourself but Basically, it just works in the modern era.

637
00:39:17,032 --> 00:39:17,455
Scott: That's good.

638
00:39:17,495 --> 00:39:18,279
Rym: That's what you need to know.

639
00:39:18,581 --> 00:39:21,500
Scott: Anyway, so the tip the extra ring there.

640
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:33,919
Scott: that's how you that's how on your little fancy iPhone headphones like I have you've got a little microphone on there and you could push Buttons to like, you know Make the track go forward or play pause or make volume up and down.

641
00:39:34,301 --> 00:39:35,745
Scott: Is that so the extra ring is doing?

642
00:39:35,765 --> 00:39:40,560
Scott: the extra ring is going the opposite direction in your iPhones or your regular phones or Android?

643
00:39:40,664 --> 00:39:41,018
Scott: phones.

644
00:39:41,542 --> 00:39:42,787
Scott: That extra ring is not.

645
00:39:42,887 --> 00:39:45,578
Scott: they're not sending anything out on that ring unless you know.

646
00:39:46,323 --> 00:39:53,729
Scott: You know if you start talking to someone on the phone They'll just send that to the tip in the first ring because you're listening to it and your ears They don't need to use that right?

647
00:39:53,749 --> 00:39:55,340
Scott: The third ring is going the opposite way.

648
00:39:55,681 --> 00:40:15,186
Scott: it's a microphone and when you push like the volume up button, it's actually creating little sounds and Sending those sounds to the phone like you said something only you can't talk like a modem going To make it volume go up Right and then the phone hears that and goes aha I guess I'll make the volume go up.

649
00:40:15,286 --> 00:40:18,580
Scott: Someone said to turn the volume up on the microphone hole on the second ring.

650
00:40:19,831 --> 00:40:21,728
Rym: so Think about what this means.

651
00:40:21,929 --> 00:40:24,240
Rym: I can take the newest iPhone.

652
00:40:25,101 --> 00:40:27,349
Rym: I can take the first Walkman.

653
00:40:27,369 --> 00:40:40,359
Scott: I can plug any pair of Headphones that were news beats and plug them into the oldest Sony Walkman and I could take the headphones that came with that oldest Sony Walkman and plug them into the newest iPhone and they'll all work.

654
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:47,397
Rym: That's a big deal because headphones might be like very well constructed like if you get good headphones, but they're dumb devices.

655
00:40:47,457 --> 00:40:51,128
Rym: They're just a Physical thing that responds to electricity.

656
00:40:51,168 --> 00:40:54,480
Rym: They're driven by the DAC in the device.

657
00:40:54,581 --> 00:40:55,489
Rym: The device was smart.

658
00:40:55,529 --> 00:40:56,760
Rym: the headphones were dumb, right?

659
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:03,186
Scott: See in the olden days you didn't even need a DAC because like you have a cassette player with a Walkman The audio is already analog.

660
00:41:03,286 --> 00:41:07,900
Scott: Yeah, it's just reading the analog audio from the tape and playing it with the amplifier.

661
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,303
Scott: Walkman does.

662
00:41:09,323 --> 00:41:13,680
Scott: it doesn't do anything else is the tape reader, but nowadays you got an mp3 player.

663
00:41:14,622 --> 00:41:29,379
Scott: You're converting those digital You know sounds into an analog sound and then sending that analog sound through an amplifier not the headphone hole But because we have that line of differentiation where the standard this TRS is used these quarter inch or eighth inch jacks.

664
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,597
Rym: I think they're officially defined in millimeter terms.

665
00:41:31,638 --> 00:41:32,322
Scott: now Whatever.

666
00:41:32,643 --> 00:41:36,618
Rym: but or you get the two and a half millimeter that some like bullshit phones used to use my ti-86 head.

667
00:41:38,563 --> 00:41:39,873
Rym: I mean, well because they use that for data.

668
00:41:39,893 --> 00:41:44,109
Scott: I think the Xbox 360 headset uses a tiny one also.

669
00:41:44,129 --> 00:41:46,400
Rym: Yeah, I've got adapters for the tiny one for my rig.

670
00:41:46,741 --> 00:41:52,697
Rym: Yeah, anyway, but because like because that standard it was almost like an abstraction layer in code.

671
00:41:52,737 --> 00:41:53,740
Rym: like because we've got that there.

672
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:54,509
Rym: It's like an interface.

673
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:56,859
Rym: Well, it is an interface Literally is an interface.

674
00:41:57,881 --> 00:42:07,288
Rym: So doesn't matter what's on the other side of it because the same thing comes out and every device that plays audio pretty much in the world Will work with this.

675
00:42:07,328 --> 00:42:08,756
Rym: headphones work everywhere.

676
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:09,017
Rym: Mm-hmm.

677
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,186
Rym: but The problem with it.

678
00:42:12,227 --> 00:42:17,810
Rym: as far as Apple has been concerned and they have been concerned about this They can't make their phone thinner.

679
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:19,176
Scott: No, and they've made.

680
00:42:19,197 --> 00:42:22,620
Rym: it is too big And in fact Apple has been so obsessed with it made it thinner.

681
00:42:22,761 --> 00:42:26,160
Scott: They even push the camera out the back a little bit to make the phone thinner.

682
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:41,690
Rym: But I found all these articles about patents and old work Apple has been doing for a long time To try to hack around to get a smaller version of these TRS eighth inch connectors Make the phone thinner and make you use a stupid adapter.

683
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:42,976
Rym: Yeah, they designed one.

684
00:42:43,016 --> 00:42:46,680
Rym: That's the same thing Except one side of it is cut flat.

685
00:42:46,801 --> 00:42:54,662
Rym: So it's like cut in two along the length just to make it thinner But otherwise work the same way and have one pusher on the top only Like.

686
00:42:54,702 --> 00:43:01,302
Rym: that's how obsessed they were with this and the rumor is that Apple is finally going to with the iPhone 7.

687
00:43:01,302 --> 00:43:04,200
Rym: Just force you to use Thunderbolt and that's where the audio comes out, right?

688
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,203
Scott: So here's the issue here.

689
00:43:05,243 --> 00:43:09,956
Scott: the people were if you remember the older iPhones before they invented lightning cables.

690
00:43:09,996 --> 00:43:11,260
Scott: their lightning Thunderbolt is different.

691
00:43:11,442 --> 00:43:17,620
Scott: Yeah before they invented the lightning cable They had the dock connector, which is like this big wide rectangle kind of thing.

692
00:43:17,701 --> 00:43:20,479
Scott: That was only one, you know, and it had a million pins on it.

693
00:43:20,881 --> 00:43:28,400
Scott: The dock connector was actually really fancy in that there was a lot of things on those pins Including analog audio output.

694
00:43:28,921 --> 00:43:40,258
Scott: so like they also sent the analog audio out a few of those pins and that's why you could easily take an old iPod and Put it on a dock and they you know a dock with speakers and could just play music because it would.

695
00:43:40,278 --> 00:43:42,407
Scott: just you know There was like extra headphone hole.

696
00:43:42,427 --> 00:43:45,360
Scott: That was a weird shape on the bottom of it in addition to the one on the top.

697
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,785
Rym: That's why that dock was cheap.

698
00:43:46,845 --> 00:43:49,656
Scott: The dock was stupid right as far as I'm aware.

699
00:43:49,776 --> 00:43:54,019
Scott: the lightning connector I could be wrong does not have analog audio output on it.

700
00:43:54,522 --> 00:43:58,420
Scott: I'm pretty sure it's a digital only connector like a serial USB kind of connector.

701
00:43:59,661 --> 00:44:00,363
Scott: We could look that up.

702
00:44:00,423 --> 00:44:01,165
Scott: Maybe I'm wrong.

703
00:44:01,185 --> 00:44:12,494
Scott: I think you're right from what I mean means now if you have lightning headphones What used to happen was the phone would convert the digital sound into the analog signal.

704
00:44:12,514 --> 00:44:14,038
Scott: the amplifier would be in your phone.

705
00:44:14,619 --> 00:44:17,587
Scott: now By you're gonna have to buy an adapter.

706
00:44:17,627 --> 00:44:34,095
Scott: that isn't just some dumb shape changing metal connecting thing for there's gonna be a circuit in There's gonna be a digital to analog, you know processing device and Either the adapter or if your headphones have a lightning cable in your headphones.

707
00:44:34,477 --> 00:44:37,239
Scott: and now suddenly This is a whole different.

708
00:44:37,662 --> 00:44:43,869
Scott: Headphones are no longer to some a speaker with a wire coming out of it Like every speaker has been for the history of speakers.

709
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:44,270
Rym: Now.

710
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:45,413
Rym: This is not a new problem.

711
00:44:45,453 --> 00:44:52,580
Scott: This has happened with serial ports The digital analog converter and possibly an amplifier in your headphones.

712
00:44:53,082 --> 00:44:59,326
Rym: Like a lot of devices if you need to just connect something to a computer to send and receive data Way easier and cheaper.

713
00:44:59,346 --> 00:45:00,651
Scott: and does this mean your head?

714
00:45:00,691 --> 00:45:02,438
Scott: does this mean your headphones need power to?

715
00:45:02,459 --> 00:45:13,359
Scott: yeah well, they're gonna get power from the lightning because you can get power from the lightning connector because that's how the The the pencil charges the pan charges off the lightning connector so you can definitely get power from it.

716
00:45:13,861 --> 00:45:20,920
Rym: So in the old days with devices you use serial ports because you can just send and receive data and Trivially implement that like in hardware.

717
00:45:21,101 --> 00:45:25,460
Scott: But the device that's using the serial port needed power from somewhere cuz serial ports didn't give power.

718
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:28,039
Scott: This is why the USB they added power to USB.

719
00:45:28,321 --> 00:45:37,237
Rym: But for a small device if you want to use USB as your serial bus You've got to implement the fucking USB stack with a chip on your device.

720
00:45:37,377 --> 00:45:41,780
Rym: Yep serial You could just take a bunch of Nang gates in there if you really wanted to and go to town.

721
00:45:42,001 --> 00:45:43,314
Scott: You just needed a double-a batteries.

722
00:45:43,597 --> 00:45:58,318
Rym: Yeah But in terms of like you could you could implement the signaling stuff without having to implement a semi software stack of USB and get a UUID and all that nonsense or GUI do whatever whatever.

723
00:45:58,579 --> 00:46:03,305
Rym: so It would be interesting if Apple did this Because it would.

724
00:46:03,325 --> 00:46:06,139
Scott: you're gonna charge your arm and a leg for an adapter, which is their favorite thing to do.

725
00:46:06,361 --> 00:46:12,297
Rym: Well, it'll also start locking you in because as soon as you buy lightning headphones You can't go back to Android.

726
00:46:12,317 --> 00:46:12,519
Rym: now.

727
00:46:12,781 --> 00:46:18,882
Scott: Well, you buy your lightning headphones and you buy a $50 adapter to turn lightning into tip ring sleeve to use it with something Else.

728
00:46:19,063 --> 00:46:25,741
Scott: Yeah, and then if you don't buy lightning headphones You're gonna have to buy a $50 adapter to use regular headphones with iPhone 7.

729
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:32,380
Rym: But it might be moot because I suspect most people are going toward Bluetooth if they have iPhones.

730
00:46:32,543 --> 00:46:38,940
Scott: Anyway, yeah I don't know why Apple doesn't just get rid of the connector entirely and say Bluetooth headphones everyone and make some fucking good ones.

731
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,119
Scott: Cuz no one makes any good ones.

732
00:46:40,221 --> 00:46:43,933
Scott: Yeah Someone's gonna tell me that someone does make good ones and you're wrong cuz.

733
00:46:43,953 --> 00:46:46,824
Scott: I've tried a lot of them and they all have problems I still use.

734
00:46:46,844 --> 00:46:56,679
Rym: I actually stopped using the old animotics because they're just too fragile and now I just have some sure Isolation earbuds with a TRS connector on the end and they work great.

735
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:02,054
Rym: But it's interesting because this dance has happened a few times.

736
00:47:02,155 --> 00:47:10,420
Rym: and with the serial port thing Serial ports are still around and a lot of things still use them because USB is inadequate even today.

737
00:47:10,821 --> 00:47:15,480
Rym: Yeah, a lot of switches a lot of routers a lot of embedded devices a lot of research devices.

738
00:47:15,822 --> 00:47:22,576
Rym: That's why even now you can buy a PCI Express Card that just has four serial ports sticking out of the bag.

739
00:47:22,596 --> 00:47:23,319
Scott: a fun thing to do.

740
00:47:23,722 --> 00:47:26,720
Scott: Just install Linux on a computer just any kind of Linux even Ubuntu.

741
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:28,687
Scott: Oh, how many kids even know this.

742
00:47:29,208 --> 00:47:40,295
Scott: and if by default it's going to run a terminal Right device on the serial port Usually the first one if you take like a VT 100 or something some serial device or

743
00:47:40,396 --> 00:47:44,374
Rym: even just get an old Windows computer Or something and just connect to it with a normal

744
00:47:44,414 --> 00:47:45,078
Scott: mini-com.

745
00:47:45,259 --> 00:47:47,814
Scott: Yeah Yeah, or you know any or even putty.

746
00:47:47,834 --> 00:47:48,860
Scott: you can probably do it, right?

747
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:58,007
Scott: And just connect a cable to that serial port to a terminal either a virtual or hardware terminal and boop They you'll turn it on and there's a login.

748
00:47:58,228 --> 00:47:59,854
Scott: It'll be like, you know login username.

749
00:47:59,874 --> 00:48:01,119
Scott: Yeah, there it is.

750
00:48:02,002 --> 00:48:03,548
Scott: Just log it on the serial port.

751
00:48:03,829 --> 00:48:05,976
Scott: cuz back in the day, that's how computers worked.

752
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:06,940
Scott: it you'd go to a school.

753
00:48:07,381 --> 00:48:12,179
Scott: There'd be one computer running Unix and there'd be a whole bunch of terminals.

754
00:48:12,782 --> 00:48:16,092
Scott: This and all those terminals had a serial cable connected to the computer.

755
00:48:16,233 --> 00:48:17,477
Rym: Yeah, they were terminals.

756
00:48:17,537 --> 00:48:18,460
Rym: They were not computers.

757
00:48:18,541 --> 00:48:19,560
Rym: There was not much going on.

758
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:22,160
Rym: They could not do stuff on their own and you can do the same thing.

759
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:27,584
Scott: You can take your computer and get a whole bunch of terminals plugged into it if you have enough serial connectors even use.

760
00:48:27,604 --> 00:48:34,529
Scott: you can even use USB to do this if you set it up and Everyone can use the same computer and all login is their own users.

761
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:37,406
Scott: One person can when you SSH in.

762
00:48:37,446 --> 00:48:37,870
Scott: what do you think?

763
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:38,231
Scott: It does.

764
00:48:38,552 --> 00:48:42,065
Scott: it creates a terminal on a device and sends it over the network.

765
00:48:42,667 --> 00:48:43,350
Scott: That's all it's doing.

766
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:47,003
Rym: So, I don't know if this rumor is true or not.

767
00:48:47,023 --> 00:48:47,726
Rym: I give it pretty much 50/50 odds.

768
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:54,550
Scott: I mean the last time it had either the rumor came about I said, yeah, that's believable Yeah, and now it's coming about again even stronger.

769
00:48:54,651 --> 00:48:55,616
Scott: so it's still believable.

770
00:48:55,697 --> 00:49:08,433
Scott: but what tends to happen with the Apple rumors is Most of them are actually Seem to be true that there aren't usually a lot of bullshit ones unless you read like really dumb websites, right and ones that are Seemingly wrong.

771
00:49:08,493 --> 00:49:10,018
Scott: like Apple didn't make a television.

772
00:49:10,058 --> 00:49:11,743
Scott: They just updated the Apple TV and stuff.

773
00:49:12,445 --> 00:49:13,368
Scott: They're usually right.

774
00:49:13,548 --> 00:49:19,510
Scott: eventually There's an is to die truth in there like Apple watch was a rumor for many years.

775
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:20,955
Scott: And then what happened eventually?

776
00:49:21,035 --> 00:49:22,520
Scott: Apple watch there at the same time.

777
00:49:23,592 --> 00:49:26,586
Rym: By that logic there are rumors about pretty much every stupid thing.

778
00:49:26,606 --> 00:49:27,270
Rym: That doesn't happen.

779
00:49:27,792 --> 00:49:32,469
Rym: So wait, which ones I'm so people were talking about smartwatches 20 years ago.

780
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:37,110
Rym: Sure, like I mean from the first iPhone there was probably some crack powders like there's gonna be an Apple watch.

781
00:49:37,953 --> 00:49:39,407
Scott: Yeah, I mean Apple made a camera.

782
00:49:41,251 --> 00:49:44,003
Scott: There's a digital camera and it wasn't in any phone and whatsoever.

783
00:49:44,083 --> 00:49:44,947
Scott: It's a whole camera.

784
00:49:45,007 --> 00:49:47,409
Scott: Apple made printers Apple made all kinds of the people don't remember.

785
00:49:48,293 --> 00:49:57,930
Rym: but Basically, if you're a nerd or a geek like us if you don't know how headphone cables work I'd actually suggest read this Wikipedia article.

786
00:49:58,552 --> 00:50:00,035
Scott: Also, do you remember that?

787
00:50:00,316 --> 00:50:04,467
Scott: You know, they're big ones to the same tip ring sleeve, but quarter-inch but big.

788
00:50:04,628 --> 00:50:05,550
Scott: Yeah, that's a thing.

789
00:50:07,133 --> 00:50:10,268
Rym: In fact, not only is that a thing but that's still you still use.

790
00:50:10,288 --> 00:50:10,650
Scott: why not?

791
00:50:10,830 --> 00:50:12,216
Rym: Did you buy a good pair of headphones?

792
00:50:12,256 --> 00:50:24,070
Rym: That's all it comes with usually because well usually will come with the adapter also Yeah, but if you have a good pair of headphones like for real headphones You're probably plugging them into a for real device like an actual mixing console or something.

793
00:50:24,211 --> 00:50:26,982
Scott: Yeah, cuz there's no other reason to wear giant headphones.

794
00:50:27,082 --> 00:50:34,006
Rym: Yeah, I Always like you see those people who have like super giant amazing like $400 studio monitor.

795
00:50:34,026 --> 00:50:34,888
Scott: Well, I didn't sit there.

796
00:50:34,988 --> 00:50:37,878
Rym: iPhone Yeah with a little adapter and this time.

797
00:50:37,978 --> 00:50:41,510
Rym: Okay, let's take it out of the bottom of the iPhone listen to an mp3 or whatever.

798
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:44,333
Scott: Like like.

799
00:50:44,393 --> 00:50:46,421
Scott: I'm sure that's so portable dude that must be so great.

800
00:50:46,481 --> 00:50:47,705
Scott: just carry around with you all day.

801
00:50:47,726 --> 00:50:51,149
Rym: your headphones are like Six times bigger than your phone.

802
00:50:53,053 --> 00:50:55,270
Scott: Might as well get the giant iPhone if you had the giant headphone.

803
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:58,825
Rym: but seriously like if you're a kid who's never run into this stuff.

804
00:50:59,408 --> 00:51:08,132
Rym: like You can use serial ports and headphone jacks and TRS stuff to do a lot of stuff without writing any Software.

805
00:51:08,313 --> 00:51:13,529
Rym: like there's cool stuff down at the bottom of computing that no one knows about anymore except old people.

806
00:51:20,045 --> 00:51:22,580
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

807
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,327
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening.

808
00:51:24,367 --> 00:51:27,400
Rym: music can't leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

809
00:51:27,701 --> 00:51:32,720
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at front row crew comm for show notes discussion news and more.

810
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:40,020
Rym: Remember GeekNights is not one but four different shows sci-tech Mondays gaming Tuesdays anime comic Wednesdays and indiscriminate Thursdays.

811

Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons attribution 3.0 license.

812
00:51:45,181 --> 00:51:48,270
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

813
00:51:48,471 --> 00:51:49,935
Scott: But unlike those other late shows.

814
00:51:50,076 --> 00:51:51,380
Scott: It's actually recorded at night.

815
00:52:11,312 --> 00:52:52,870
Rym: The patrons tonight for this episode in order of the amount of money you're giving us are Nicholas Brando Rebecca Dunn James David White Christian Koontz Jess mechanical mind Renee from New Zealand Robert Lee Ryan Perrin drew Oppenlander rare Lavelle Brian Cedroni Rochelle, Montanona Finn Eric Silveraude Rym eats poop Edgar Mendez William Eisen rose Aaron Sarris Chris midkiff Chris Knox flame dark fire Samuel Cordray Daniel Redman Chris a dad Doug Snyder Sean Klein Chris Reimer and Thomas Hahn.

816
00:52:53,805 --> 00:52:57,330
Rym: so Yeah, we had some trouble trying to figure out what to do the show on today.

817
00:52:57,490 --> 00:53:02,364
Rym: Scott did not want to talk about anything and he doesn't care about tech news.

818
00:53:02,665 --> 00:53:04,269
Rym: He refused to even pick newses.

819
00:53:04,911 --> 00:53:15,247
Rym: So I just picked four of the like 20 things I thought were worth talking about into the news and Then I convinced him to do the show on TRS and headphone jacks.

820
00:53:15,972 --> 00:53:18,928
Rym: Somehow he agreed to it, but he was like as your ideas stupid.

821
00:53:19,450 --> 00:53:24,230
Rym: We had like two minutes to talk about and yeah analyze the wave like I dumped it out.

822
00:53:24,310 --> 00:53:26,658
Rym: We talked about 50% of the time each.

823
00:53:26,678 --> 00:53:28,926
Rym: In fact Scott talked a little bit more than me in this episode.

824
00:53:29,729 --> 00:53:41,210
Rym: So Yeah, Scott says we can't do shows on things because there's nothing to say and if I trick him into doing it Then we do a show that would push an hour unless I actually cut him off.

825
00:53:41,972 --> 00:53:43,737
Rym: So, I don't know what we'll do.

826
00:53:43,757 --> 00:53:45,282
Rym: We're thinking about changing up the format.

827
00:53:45,342 --> 00:53:46,505
Rym: maybe for Mondays.

828
00:53:47,307 --> 00:54:01,050
Rym: We might start doing four to five news's and then a shorter main bit or Maybe we'll just do four news's and then whatever our longest news was going to be We'll talk about whatever generic topic can come out of that.

829
00:54:02,675 --> 00:54:03,910
Rym: If it means shorter shows fine.

830
00:54:04,030 --> 00:54:10,650
Rym: I actually think it'll be fine because Scott did fine and the show ended up in my opinion reasonably good.

831
00:54:11,996 --> 00:54:20,550
Rym: if any of you have complaints I tried to cut Scott off about the Minor details of exactly how TRS works in audio between balanced and unbalanced and which is what?

832
00:54:21,330 --> 00:54:29,370
Rym: no one actually needs to know that unless you're writing the spec modern equipment is not going to hurt you, but Generally don't plug headphones into microphone jacks.

833
00:54:29,470 --> 00:54:35,249
Rym: You might ruin the headphones because of the bias voltage or phantom power or whatever nonsense might be hidden in there.

834
00:54:36,144 --> 00:54:40,044
Rym: anyway I'm starting pre-production still on.

835
00:54:40,064 --> 00:54:41,010
Rym: he knows present sutana.

836
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:42,977
Rym: I'll post some updates about that in the patreon soon.

837
00:54:43,479 --> 00:55:49,790
Rym: Scott still as far as I can tell does not listen to this nonsense and I now leave you your moment of literally the opposite of Zen - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

838
00:56:05,790 --> 00:56:01,850
Scott:  - - - - - - - - - - - - -

839
00:56:07,810 --> 00:56:07,830
Rym: 

840
00:56:09,810 --> 00:56:11,830
Scott:  -

841
00:56:13,810 --> 00:56:13,830
Rym: 

842
00:56:15,810 --> 00:56:15,830
Scott: 

843
00:56:17,810 --> 00:56:17,830
Rym: 

844
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:21,830
Scott:  -.
