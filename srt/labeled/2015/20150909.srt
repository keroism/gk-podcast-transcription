1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,480
Rym: It's Wednesday, September 9th, 2015.

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:10,841
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,192 --> 00:00:13,809
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,475
Rym: And this is The GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,736 --> 00:00:19,190
Rym: We're back from PAX and we're talking about One Punch Man.

6
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,229
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:30,560
Rym: Yeah, we missed a lot of shows and we're gonna miss a bunch more because I'm gonna be in Singapore and Australia for like the next three weeks.

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,759
Scott: Oh, you know, there was a PAX was a week early this year.

9
00:00:34,421 --> 00:00:39,120
Scott: And then there's Labor Day because PAX wasn't on Labor Day as usual.

10
00:00:39,301 --> 00:00:43,660
Rym: And we celebrate Labor Day by not laboring, so we didn't do any GeekNights.

11
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:44,746
Scott: No, why would I do that?

12
00:00:44,766 --> 00:00:46,420
Scott: when I could lay in the park and dick around, right?

13
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,300
Rym: I ran in a race, though, and among the old men category, I was the second fastest old man.

14
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:52,979
Scott: Second fastest old man?

15
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:53,128
Rym: Yeah.

16
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,780
Scott: Who was the faster old man than you?

17
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,599
Rym: The faster old man beat me by like two minutes, so there was no chance.

18
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,539
Rym: Who is this old man?

19
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:17,060
Rym: So, the funny thing is, because they break it down by basically 10-year age groups once you get into your 20s, and what gives me hope is that the top three times for these 5K and 10K races for old men, not that much worse than the times for younger men.

20
00:01:17,561 --> 00:01:19,209
Scott: So, I feel like- But yours was two minutes.

21
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,399
Scott: How many younger men beat you?

22
00:01:20,921 --> 00:01:24,655
Rym: I was sixth overall among everyone, even like- How many people were in this thing?

23
00:01:24,696 --> 00:01:24,880
Scott: Seven?

24
00:01:25,381 --> 00:01:26,500
Rym: Like 380.

25
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:26,799
Rym: Okay.

26
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:27,153
Rym: Yeah.

27
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:34,680
Rym: So, the only people who beat me were 20-somethings and 130-something who have hot bods and actually train.

28
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:36,750
Rym: Emily did really well, too.

29
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:37,879
Rym: We're both pretty fast.

30
00:01:38,963 --> 00:01:40,360
Scott: Did you get some sort of medal?

31
00:01:41,361 --> 00:01:42,004
Rym: So, yes.

32
00:01:42,064 --> 00:01:42,728
Rym: I got a trophy.

33
00:01:42,748 --> 00:01:44,860
Rym: It's made out of Lucite, and it's in the other room.

34
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,858
Rym: I also have this trophy from last time.

35
00:01:48,021 --> 00:01:55,298
Rym: So, I don't run races that often, like maybe once a year, and I kind of wanted to win this one, at least among the old man 30s age group.

36
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:59,855
Rym: So, I ran real hard, and my time was like 19, 59, almost exactly 20 minutes.

37
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:01,485
Scott: We were like,

38
00:02:01,505 --> 00:02:01,607
Scott: "Pah!".

39
00:02:02,621 --> 00:02:06,459
Rym: So, I ran hard, and so at the end- Could you have run harder?

40
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:09,026
Rym: I don't think so, actually.

41
00:02:09,047 --> 00:02:11,760
Rym: I think I ran as hard as I could have run on that day.

42
00:02:12,441 --> 00:02:18,920
Rym: But I ran over the finish line, walked over to some bushes, and immediately vomited into those bushes.

43
00:02:19,162 --> 00:02:19,740
Scott: Oh, you suck.

44
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,572
Rym: Which, I mean, that happens if you push too hard, especially in a foot race.

45
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,180
Rym: That's just something that happens.

46
00:02:24,621 --> 00:02:25,900
Rym: Marathon runners shit themselves.

47
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,340
Scott: You also have a blarging problem.

48
00:02:27,742 --> 00:02:28,534
Rym: My body's go-to.

49
00:02:29,701 --> 00:02:33,554
Rym: My body, like if there's a conference inside of my body, like, "Hey, something's going on.

50
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:34,939
Rym: Man, what should we do about

51
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:35,019
Rym: it?".

52
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,440
Scott: Also, if you do something that makes you bargle, that's a sign you shouldn't do that thing.

53
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,858
Rym: Yeah, but running, I'll live longer if I run.

54
00:02:42,707 --> 00:02:43,160
Scott: Not if you bargle.

55
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,840
Rym: And maybe you shouldn't push that hard without draining your body.

56
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,299
Scott: Not if you bargle your body out.

57
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,730
Rym: Might have been the Red Bull.

58
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:48,859
Rym: I chugged before the race, too.

59
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,303
Rym: What?

60
00:02:49,626 --> 00:02:50,331
Scott: I think that's cheating.

61
00:02:50,372 --> 00:02:51,340
Scott: They didn't test for that Red Bull?

62
00:02:54,005 --> 00:02:54,478
Rym: What next?

63
00:02:55,001 --> 00:03:02,380
Rym: So I run over to the finish line, I walk over to the bushes, I just vomit, and then I turn around, and I'm feeling good, like I'm smiling, and there's a kid standing right there.

64
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:08,054
Rym: And he's looking at me, and he looks up at me, because he just saw me projectile vomit in some bushes, and just goes,

65
00:03:08,575 --> 00:03:10,360
Rym: "Wooooow.".

66
00:03:12,684 --> 00:03:13,719
Rym: Pretty much that made my day.

67
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:18,140
Scott: Okay, maybe just next time you see a kid, stick your finger down your throat and bargle.

68
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,480
Rym: You know, vomiting is actually pretty funny.

69
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,639
Scott: Uh, you can do all the vomiting.

70
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,833
Rym: If someone else is doing it.

71
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,239
Rym: Somewhere near me, and I can't smell it.

72
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,840
Scott: I am not doing any vomiting.

73
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,260
Scott: I read something recently that there might be like disease transmission from like vomit particles in the air.

74
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,499
Rym: I could easily believe that.

75
00:03:35,721 --> 00:03:36,338
Scott: So I'm gonna avoid vomit.

76
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:44,760
Rym: I read a similar article talking about how air dryers in public bathrooms are just spreading pee and fecal coliform all over.

77
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,850
Scott: Well, at least they're not on my hands.

78
00:03:46,992 --> 00:03:48,060
Scott: Spread it all over the ground.

79
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,880
Rym: Get it in the lungs and other people's hands.

80
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,080
Scott: Yeah, blast it off of my hands onto the wall.

81
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:57,440
Rym: So yeah, we're pretty much back for a little while, and then I'll disappear to Australia for a while.

82
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:01,279
Rym: As long as I don't die mountain biking in Singapore, or mountain biking in Australia.

83
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:01,724
Scott: Poison snake.

84
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,019
Scott: Poison spider.

85
00:04:03,601 --> 00:04:05,310
Rym: Actually, I was reading about this place.

86
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,260
Rym: It's like this semi-abandoned island.

87
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,759
Scott: So even more poison snakes.

88
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:09,606
Rym: Uh, nope.

89
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:10,760
Rym: Snakes are not a problem there.

90
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,560
Rym: The problem is very poisonous lizards.

91
00:04:14,161 --> 00:04:14,944
Scott: It's close enough.

92
00:04:14,964 --> 00:04:18,600
Scott: I mean, not snakes, other poisonous lizards.

93
00:04:18,861 --> 00:04:23,179
Rym: The website was like, if a lizard is blocking the bike path, do not antagonize it.

94
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,379
Rym: Just choose another path, and it'll eventually go somewhere else.

95
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,558
Scott: How big is this lizard that you can't just bike over it?

96
00:04:29,431 --> 00:04:29,758
Scott: I don't know.

97
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,959
Scott: Or bike really past fast it.

98
00:04:31,361 --> 00:04:32,315
Rym: I guess I'll find out.

99
00:04:33,701 --> 00:04:38,487
Rym: So I'm gonna go to this island on Saturday, because while I'm there, as I am- Saturday is the no lizard day?

100
00:04:38,507 --> 00:04:40,500
Scott: Is the day the lizard's taking the day off from poisoning people to death?

101
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,080
Rym: Well, Thursday I gotta go to a convention and give a panel.

102
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,320
Scott: How many people have died from lizard on this island?

103
00:04:45,761 --> 00:04:47,092
Rym: Not many, as far as I can tell.

104
00:04:47,133 --> 00:04:47,940
Rym: The island's pretty safe.

105
00:04:48,081 --> 00:04:50,740
Scott: How many people have gone to hospital through the lizard on this island?

106
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:54,460
Rym: I think more people have gone to hospital from the mountain biking part than the lizard part.

107
00:04:54,881 --> 00:04:57,919
Scott: Well, but if you get a double whammy, you fall off the mountain bike, there's a lizard!

108
00:04:59,404 --> 00:05:01,660
Scott: Well, that's what would happen in any comedy movie ever.

109
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:08,156
Rym: That is one thing, at least with skiing, that while I am not as good as skier, I don't think- Yes, if you fall off ski, there are only poisonous lizards.

110
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,916
Scott: There will just be a polar bear there, and a yeti.

111
00:05:11,642 --> 00:05:13,420
Rym: Not a polar bear, but probably a grizzly bear.

112
00:05:13,942 --> 00:05:16,354
Scott: I mean, the yeti comes 100% of the time, every time.

113
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,539
Scott: But if you never stop- No matter what, if you ski long enough, the yeti will come.

114
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,079
Rym: But if you never stop, and never slow down, and never fuck up, you won't actually catch you.

115
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,078
Scott: Bumbles bounce you.

116
00:05:30,421 --> 00:05:35,720
Rym: So yeah, you got any news, or a Geek Byte perhaps, now that we're back and we're talking about anime, manga, comics, and the like?

117
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,880
Scott: Well, there isn't a lot of comics news lately, probably because the newer Comic-Con is like in a few weeks.

118
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,060
Scott: Oh, right.

119
00:05:41,361 --> 00:05:48,460
Scott: But there is some sort of comics news, it's just releases, but there's some very important releases of things right now.

120
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,240
Scott: It is currently Wednesday, you're probably listening to this on at least Thursday.

121
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,778
Scott: That is Wednesday, September 9th.

122
00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:00,380
Rym: I know who listens the night we put these things up, because of who posts in the forum and tweets at me about stuff.

123
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,200
Scott: There must be at least more people who are lurking and do that, but yeah, what's wrong with you?

124
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:11,980
Scott: Anyway, today, in the comic book store, there are comics on the shelf that were not there yesterday.

125
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:15,680
Scott: Unless you have a comic book store that puts things up early, but they definitely weren't there Monday.

126
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,962
Scott: And those things are, as follows, Saga Volume 5.

127
00:06:20,962 --> 00:06:22,520
Rym: Oh yeah, I'm behind on Saga.

128
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,240
Scott: Which, if you read the trade paperbacks, that's new to you, if you read the individual issues, you've read these already, obviously.

129
00:06:28,661 --> 00:06:31,452
Scott: And also, Descender #1, well, Volume 1, which, same deal.

130
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:40,357
Scott: Descender is, oh my god, it's by Jeff Lemire, one of our favorite people.

131
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,488
Rym: Jeff Lemire is definitely up there.

132
00:06:42,508 --> 00:06:43,374
Rym: Jason and the like.

133
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:49,980
Scott: It's about this kid who's a robot in space, what else do you need to know?

134
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,318
Scott: The art, OMG.

135
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,980
Scott: So, go to the comic book store, if you didn't go there already.

136
00:06:55,823 --> 00:06:59,839
Scott: Oh, and not there yet, but you can pre-order it now.

137
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,840
Scott: The subject of this episode, the man who punches only one time, per bad guy.

138
00:07:05,905 --> 00:07:06,799
Scott: The one punch man.

139
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,246
Rym: He might kick a few times.

140
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:11,020
Rym: Shove more than once on many occasions.

141
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,698
Scott: He pretty much just punches people once and that's it.

142
00:07:14,681 --> 00:07:22,719
Scott: That manga, which has been only available by Scanlation in the US, is going to be legally available in like a month or two.

143
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:23,656
Rym: Eagle.

144
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:32,120
Scott: Yes, you can buy it at the store instead of reading it online and you can pre-order that now.

145
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:42,680
Scott: I think they're putting out two volumes in one month, so it's going to be one of those deals where it's like, if you think, oh man, but I've already, I read a whole bunch of the manga online and then stopped when they were fighting a fisherman.

146
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,600
Scott: That seems to be usually when I stop reading a Shonen Jump manga.

147
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,660
Rym: Except for his slayers, that's when you start reading.

148
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:54,100
Scott: Now, two volumes a month, they're going to catch right the hell up to Japan and we're going to be good to go.

149
00:07:55,281 --> 00:07:57,488
Scott: You can just stop reading the illegal stuff now.

150
00:07:57,949 --> 00:08:01,260
Scott: You'll get a much better translation and printing in the legit ones.

151
00:08:04,581 --> 00:08:20,240
Rym: I noticed kind of randomly, I was poking around on YouTube, that a ton of those old late 80s and 90s OAVs that were mostly, like they were on the sci-fi channel just occasionally with those streamlined dubs, they're pretty much all on YouTube.

152
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,420
Rym: Just the whole movie is in super high quality.

153
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:32,700
Scott: Yeah, I mean anything that was subtitled at some point but isn't popular and no one's going to go checking on the license or anything is totally on YouTube.

154
00:08:33,501 --> 00:08:35,960
Scott: You'd also be surprised how much stuff is legally on YouTube.

155
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:41,260
Scott: There's a Gundam info YouTube channel that has so many legal Gundams on it that you can watch.

156
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,008
Rym: So I watched some Vampire Hunter D like, "Oh right, that

157
00:08:44,068 --> 00:08:44,590
Rym: thing!".

158
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:47,780
Rym: and I was reminiscing over those streamlined dubs of all these things.

159
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,636
Rym: And then I clicked on 8 Men After like, "Hey, check this out, 8 Men After.

160
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:51,737
Rym: It's

161
00:08:51,777 --> 00:08:52,199
Rym: Robocop.".

162
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,078
Scott: Why do you have time to watch this?

163
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,139
Rym: It's not long.

164
00:08:55,781 --> 00:08:56,139
Rym: Okay.

165
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,219
Rym: So we start watching it like a little bit like, "Okay, right, old

166
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:00,460
Rym: OAVs."

167
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:09,238
Rym: And we make fun of it and then instead of turning it off, we kind of just kept watching it because we kind of missed those old dumb 90s OAVs.

168
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,160
Scott: If you didn't have nostalgia for it though, would it be any good at all?

169
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:12,543
Rym: You know what?

170
00:09:12,764 --> 00:09:15,040
Rym: It holds up way better than I would have expected.

171
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:15,919
Scott: Well, it's not He-Man.

172
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:26,620
Rym: It's other than the fact that the girl keeps wearing that Band-Aid on her head and she seems pretty dumb and she keeps saying the same thing over again.

173
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,779
Rym: And also the streamlined dub being a streamlined dub.

174
00:09:31,402 --> 00:09:36,940
Rym: It was good enough and engaging enough to where we kind of just kept watching it.

175
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,003
Scott: But you got to remember, right?

176
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:44,620
Scott: These animes that were on the 90s, we were watching them as like teenagers or whatever, right?

177
00:09:46,560 --> 00:10:00,480
Scott: The old guys of anime who we see at the anime con sometimes who were like way older than us, like 50s, 60s, they were our age or they were adults when those things were on Sci-Fi Channel in the 90s and they were watching them, enjoying them.

178
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:00,733
Scott: Yeah.

179
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,389
Scott: So we're that age now.

180
00:10:04,481 --> 00:10:09,100
Scott: It's not like He-Man where we only watched it when we were three years old and that's why we liked it, you know?

181
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:10,621
Scott: Well, you know what it is?

182
00:10:10,681 --> 00:10:19,580
Rym: It's that these OAVs, they have alternatingly great and terrible animation and there's just this certain like they have to finish their whole story quickly.

183
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:26,120
Rym: So they're kind of like a movie, but they're usually based on things that would have been or were a manga or a TV show.

184
00:10:26,662 --> 00:10:28,840
Rym: So they have to kind of compress the action together.

185
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:30,322
Rym: I don't know.

186
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:32,876
Rym: I might do a show on 8-Man After if I get Scott to watch it.

187
00:10:32,896 --> 00:10:33,559
Rym: Have you ever seen it?

188
00:10:34,354 --> 00:10:34,640
Scott: Uh, no.

189
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:35,880
Rym: Do you know what it's about?

190
00:10:36,381 --> 00:10:37,460
Scott: Uh, the 8th Man.

191
00:10:37,641 --> 00:10:38,678
Rym: Do you know who the 8th Man is?

192
00:10:39,122 --> 00:10:40,059
Scott: Not the 7th Man.

193
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,538
Rym: Tobor the 8th Man?

194
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,283
Scott: Oh, right.

195
00:10:42,323 --> 00:10:43,390
Scott: Tobor.

196
00:10:43,551 --> 00:10:44,900
Scott: It's an acronym of robot.

197
00:10:45,705 --> 00:10:46,979
Rym: Oh, aducardo.

198
00:10:47,756 --> 00:10:47,820
Scott: Yes.

199
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:50,466
Scott: And he's some sort of hero.

200
00:10:50,486 --> 00:10:53,680
Scott: He fights bad guys, punches them, eats them with robot powers.

201
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,580
Rym: 8-Man After is an OAV movie that basically takes place long after 8-Man's death.

202
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,630
Rym: And I'm not going to say it's particularly good.

203
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,676
Rym: I'm not going to hold it out on any anime.

204
00:11:06,716 --> 00:11:07,700
Rym: that like everyone must see.

205
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:09,908
Rym: It's better than you might think.

206
00:11:10,028 --> 00:11:12,360
Rym: It's a pretty much straight up Robocop story.

207
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:16,720
Rym: With some roided up cyborgs playing American football.

208
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:17,634
Scott: Oh, yeah.

209
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:20,207
Scott: Is MD Geist among them?

210
00:11:20,227 --> 00:11:22,200
Scott: He knows how to play American football.

211
00:11:23,101 --> 00:11:25,299
Rym: That would be the mashup I would do like my thing of the day.

212
00:11:26,223 --> 00:11:30,000
Rym: But the other thing I've been watching with Emily is Bojack Horseman.

213
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:36,360
Rym: That animated show with, you know, the guy with the horse head that you see everywhere on Netflix.

214
00:11:37,662 --> 00:11:40,533
Scott: I don't have Netflix anymore, but I saw this because people said it.

215
00:11:40,593 --> 00:11:42,500
Scott: so I googled it and I saw a horseman.

216
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:49,220
Scott: And the first thing I thought was, well, all those people wearing a horse mask are now cosplaying something specific and not just a horseman.

217
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:55,060
Rym: They're only cosplaying Bojack Horseman if the rest of their body looks like a frumpy 50 year old.

218
00:11:55,686 --> 00:11:55,954
Scott: Yes.

219
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:04,780
Rym: So Bojack, I like I saw ads for it because and I normally came up with this thing.

220
00:12:05,101 --> 00:12:06,988
Rym: So I normally don't really notice ads.

221
00:12:07,028 --> 00:12:17,020
Rym: However, when I was biking home every day early in the summer, they had hired an entire brick wall along that bike path and it was a picture of Bojack.

222
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:17,722
Scott: Oh, that brick.

223
00:12:17,762 --> 00:12:22,339
Scott: I know the brick wall you're talking about where they always put like really high resolution advertisements painted on.

224
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:22,701
Scott: Yep.

225
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,560
Rym: So one day I was biking home and there's a horse head.

226
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,487
Scott: I always wonder how they do that.

227
00:12:26,508 --> 00:12:27,680
Scott: I like to be there when they put the ad out.

228
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,691
Rym: They're doing one right now.

229
00:12:28,711 --> 00:12:29,379
Rym: You know how they do it?

230
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,900
Scott: They print it out, they stick it up against the wall and hit it with a flamethrower?

231
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:33,060
Scott: No.

232
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:37,940
Rym: There's literally seven people just like sitting around on a giant scaffold just painting it by hand.

233
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:38,308
Scott: Really?

234
00:12:38,682 --> 00:12:38,770
Scott: Yeah.

235
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:39,479
Scott: They're really good.

236
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:39,941
Rym: Yeah.

237
00:12:40,062 --> 00:12:41,368
Rym: Like I stopped and watched them for a little bit.

238
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,680
Rym: If they're still there later in the week, maybe I'll stop.

239
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:44,578
Scott: What are they painting now?

240
00:12:45,422 --> 00:12:46,859
Rym: Looks like a football, sports ball thing.

241
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:47,357
Scott: Oh, OK.

242
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,919
Rym: But I might stop and give them a card.

243
00:12:49,261 --> 00:12:49,680
Scott: It is the season.

244
00:12:49,801 --> 00:12:51,368
Rym: It'd be interesting to interview someone like that.

245
00:12:51,448 --> 00:12:53,397
Rym: So you paint ads by hand.

246
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,392
Scott: Yeah, I get paid a ton of money.

247
00:12:55,432 --> 00:12:56,058
Scott: You can't do this.

248
00:12:57,082 --> 00:12:58,229
Rym: You know, we do do a joint show.

249
00:12:58,249 --> 00:12:59,960
Rym: We also get our friend, the chalk artist.

250
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:04,020
Scott: Now, see, I wonder the people who own the building that's getting painted on, how much are they making?

251
00:13:04,566 --> 00:13:04,651
Rym: Yeah.

252
00:13:05,522 --> 00:13:07,980
Rym: Should we buy a building just to be in one of those places?

253
00:13:08,642 --> 00:13:11,380
Scott: You mean like the thing in the middle of Times Square that's basically an empty building?

254
00:13:11,622 --> 00:13:11,844
Scott: Yeah.

255
00:13:11,864 --> 00:13:13,400
Rym: Just like that, actually.

256
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,459
Scott: It has like a Walgreens in the bottom and that's it?

257
00:13:15,601 --> 00:13:16,388
Rym: We buy a building.

258
00:13:16,449 --> 00:13:17,660
Rym: It's actually our banana stand.

259
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,499
Rym: But on the outside, we make money by selling ads on it.

260
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:32,180
Rym: Anyway, so the ad was a reverse centaur, basically, laying on its back in a sexy George Costanza style pose.

261
00:13:32,564 --> 00:13:33,919
Rym: And it just said, hey there.

262
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:40,360
Rym: And I remember I biked past it and I actually stopped, went back and took a picture of it and tweeted it at Adam.

263
00:13:40,622 --> 00:13:43,198
Rym: Just kind of randomly because I was kind of taken aback by it.

264
00:13:44,042 --> 00:13:47,640
Rym: Only relatively recently did I actually go see what the hell that thing was and watch it.

265
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,222
Rym: And you know what?

266
00:13:48,242 --> 00:13:52,379
Rym: If you haven't watched it, it's not what you'd expect it to be.

267
00:13:53,682 --> 00:13:56,000
Scott: Isn't it just one of those Adult Swim shows, right?

268
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,809
Rym: It doesn't act, feel, sound.

269
00:13:58,191 --> 00:13:59,960
Rym: It is in no way like those shows.

270
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,719
Scott: The picture looks like that.

271
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,042
Rym: Yeah.

272
00:14:02,244 --> 00:14:03,740
Rym: I expected it to be that kind of humor.

273
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:04,880
Scott: Is it on Adult Swim?

274
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:06,340
Rym: It's just on Netflix.

275
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,339
Scott: Oh, it's a Netflix only?

276
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,740
Rym: It is a Netflix original.

277
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:09,190
Rym: Oh.

278
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:13,180
Scott: But the deal is that if you- Is that the first animated Netflix original?

279
00:14:13,864 --> 00:14:14,890
Rym: I don't know.

280
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,660
Rym: I actually really don't know.

281
00:14:16,921 --> 00:14:18,000
Rym: Are the other ones all live action?

282
00:14:18,301 --> 00:14:20,474
Rym: All the ones I liked and watched were live action.

283
00:14:20,615 --> 00:14:20,957
Rym: It might be.

284
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,375
Rym: It's an American animated sitcom, blah, blah, blah, blah.

285
00:14:25,421 --> 00:14:27,380
Rym: It doesn't say here in a trivial reading of Wikipedia.

286
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:40,539
Rym: But anyway, the show is actually a pretty hard to watch, brutal human drama that just happens to be animated and just happens to have about half the characters have horse heads and owl heads and things.

287
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,558
Scott: Ooh, owl heads.

288
00:14:41,761 --> 00:14:45,240
Rym: Yeah, actually the owl girl, Wanda, is pretty much the best character.

289
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:45,999
Scott: I like owls.

290
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,680
Rym: You would really like this character.

291
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:48,189
Rym: Ooh.

292
00:14:49,544 --> 00:14:50,439
Rym: I got to show you Wanda.

293
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:51,029
Scott: Okay.

294
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,334
Rym: The thing about Wanda, well, I'm not going to say anything about the show.

295
00:14:54,455 --> 00:14:55,200
Rym: That's not Wanda.

296
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,800
Scott: None of those are the Wanda you're talking about because none of them are owls.

297
00:14:59,562 --> 00:14:59,929
Rym: There you go.

298
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:00,379
Rym: There's Wanda.

299
00:15:00,881 --> 00:15:01,680
Scott: Oh, she's pretty good.

300
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:01,971
Scott: Yeah.

301
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:08,119
Rym: So the show is about a washed up actor and how fucked up he is and how fucked up his life is.

302
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:16,080
Rym: And about 10% of the show is also jokes about the fact that half the people are animals.

303
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,680
Rym: Like Bojack gets kind of messed up if he eats too much cotton candy.

304
00:15:21,101 --> 00:15:23,560
Rym: Like give a real horse cotton candy and they'll flip out.

305
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,700
Scott: Shouldn't a real horse not eat cotton candy?

306
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,700
Rym: Yeah, real horses should not eat cotton candy.

307
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,609
Scott: I mean, animals shouldn't eat sugar in general.

308
00:15:30,052 --> 00:15:31,198
Scott: Humans get a good idea.

309
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:36,140
Rym: Let me just say, if a real horse gets near a cotton candy machine, there's going to be some trouble.

310
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:41,139
Rym: But it's about like a 90s TV star who's now rich and washed up.

311
00:15:41,901 --> 00:15:46,060
Rym: And it's just this really depressing and real human drama.

312
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:52,639
Rym: And I really like it more than I expected to the point that I'm pretty much marathoning it as fast as I can.

313
00:15:53,527 --> 00:15:53,959
Scott: All right.

314
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,305
Rym: I already got a second season.

315
00:15:55,385 --> 00:16:02,120
Rym: I mean, I don't know if you'd like it, but if you don't like it, Scott, it won't be because it's like Archer or all those other kinds of shows we like.

316
00:16:02,502 --> 00:16:06,340
Rym: It's going to be a different kind of not liking from any not liking that you've had up to this point.

317
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,000
Scott: It can go to the bottom of the queue somewhere.

318
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,331
Rym: You should watch a few episodes at some point.

319
00:16:10,392 --> 00:16:11,840
Rym: I wouldn't put it at the top of the queue, though.

320
00:16:12,362 --> 00:16:14,160
Scott: I mean, the queue is getting pretty deep.

321
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,080
Rym: If you're not Scott Rubin, however, watch some Bojack.

322
00:16:17,941 --> 00:16:24,280
Rym: The only caveat is that it might be a little too real for you and it might be a little too close to home.

323
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,459
Scott: Yes, the Owl Girl is too close to home.

324
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,370
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

325
00:16:35,112 --> 00:16:40,730
Rym: Someone made this the Antonio Maria da Silva M's films YouTube account.

326
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:46,970
Rym: It got like fifteen million, five million, ten million more views or whatever since when I first found it.

327
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:49,650
Scott: But it only has three million total views, not even.

328
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:50,071
Rym: Yeah.

329
00:16:50,212 --> 00:16:52,689
Rym: It seems like it's posted on a bunch of other YouTube channels now.

330
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:55,188
Rym: So I'm trying to figure out who originally made it.

331
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:02,410
Rym: But it's an amazing compositing mashup of like every movie ever.

332
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:08,490
Rym: Yeah, like fifty different movies and characters from them all in the same nightclub.

333
00:17:09,913 --> 00:17:11,383
Rym: And you pretty much just have to watch it.

334
00:17:11,443 --> 00:17:12,450
Rym: It's like ten minutes long.

335
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,448
Rym: It's kind of insane that someone made this.

336
00:17:15,511 --> 00:17:16,989
Scott: Someone really had nothing to do.

337
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:20,409
Scott: I mean, the core was really, really, really good with video editing.

338
00:17:20,731 --> 00:17:31,370
Rym: The characters range from Star Wars Episode One to multiple Tom Cruises from different movies to Al Pacino to Blade to Arnold from Terminator One.

339
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:33,875
Rym: Scarface is in there.

340
00:17:33,915 --> 00:17:36,410
Rym: In fact, Scarface is a major character in the plot that unfolds.

341
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,006
Scott: There's a plot?

342
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:38,469
Rym: Yeah, actually.

343
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:40,170
Scott: OK, I couldn't tell if there was a plot.

344
00:17:40,452 --> 00:17:41,049
Scott: There is a plot.

345
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:42,470
Scott: A mashup for the sake of mashing up.

346
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,630
Rym: A gunfight breaks out and shit goes down.

347
00:17:44,895 --> 00:17:45,170
Scott: All right.

348
00:17:46,453 --> 00:17:47,749
Rym: You just have to watch this thing.

349
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:49,060
Scott: OK.

350
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:53,170
Scott: So it might have been a thing of the day previously, the Senpai Club.

351
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:56,930
Scott: So if you don't know, if you didn't pay attention last time, it was probably a thing of the day.

352
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:58,210
Rym: Scott's a big fan of Senpai Club.

353
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,317
Scott: There's this people.

354
00:17:59,337 --> 00:18:01,570
Scott: I think it's like, you know, this couple.

355
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:02,389
Scott: I think they're a couple.

356
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:05,910
Rym: Oh, here's the picture that was that was on the ad of BoJack.

357
00:18:06,195 --> 00:18:06,409
Scott: Great.

358
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:06,879
Scott: Yeah.

359
00:18:07,213 --> 00:18:07,403
Scott: All right.

360
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:07,888
Rym: Anyway.

361
00:18:09,811 --> 00:18:13,022
Scott: And they make, you know, just cute anime for YouTube.

362
00:18:13,304 --> 00:18:16,750
Scott: that, you know, in their spare time, I assume it doesn't seem like they're getting paid for it.

363
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,489
Scott: And their studio is named Make Babies.

364
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,587
Scott: Make Babbie dot ES.

365
00:18:20,931 --> 00:18:21,058
Scott: Right.

366
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:21,657
Scott: Get it?

367
00:18:21,739 --> 00:18:22,130
Scott: The spelling.

368
00:18:22,439 --> 00:18:22,507
Scott: OK.

369
00:18:23,174 --> 00:18:24,050
Scott: And they make the cut.

370
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:26,849
Scott: They think they're currently making this called Senpai Club, which is like the best.

371
00:18:27,692 --> 00:18:33,670
Scott: And it's pretty much like this parody of anime in general, like school anime.

372
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:37,950
Scott: And, you know, like making fun of the girl running to school with toast in her mouth.

373
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:38,181
Rym: Yeah.

374
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:40,449
Rym: Or like the triangle headed be shown in.

375
00:18:40,694 --> 00:18:40,970
Scott: Right.

376
00:18:41,071 --> 00:18:41,430
Scott: Exactly.

377
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:44,470
Scott: So the latest episode, however.

378
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,508
Scott: Well, part one of episode three.

379
00:18:47,211 --> 00:18:52,767
Scott: The opener is like in the old school anime 70s, 80s anime style.

380
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,810
Scott: And they put a lot of work into it.

381
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:57,890
Scott: And it's it's incredible.

382
00:18:58,251 --> 00:19:00,550
Scott: So you need to see it if you haven't been paying attention.

383
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:01,410
Rym: It's one of the better.

384
00:19:01,831 --> 00:19:02,087
Scott: Even more.

385
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:02,748
Scott: Even more.

386
00:19:03,131 --> 00:19:11,370
Scott: Like, even if you don't want to watch all of Senpai Club, if you know anything about anime and old anime, just watch this, you know, start of episode three, part one.

387
00:19:12,253 --> 00:19:13,610
Rym: You do have to know a little bit about anime.

388
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,188
Rym: If you haven't seen a lot of anime, you're probably.

389
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:16,269
Scott: It's a parody of anime.

390
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:18,029
Scott: If you don't know anime, what sense will it make?

391
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:21,149
Rym: It's like trying to watch Excel Saga if you've never seen anime.

392
00:19:23,712 --> 00:19:26,990
Rym: In the moment, the Book Club book was the Wheel of Time.

393
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,369
Rym: Book one, a fantasy book, the novel.

394
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:32,510
Scott: But we're going to do episode on it like tomorrow.

395
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:33,055
Scott: Yeah.

396
00:19:33,952 --> 00:19:34,749
Scott: Well, it'll go up.

397
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:37,630
Rym: Who knows when we're going to try to put up episodes while I'm overseas.

398
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:38,850
Scott: We finished reading it.

399
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:41,930
Scott: We're going to record as many episodes as we can before it gets on a plane.

400
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:44,910
Scott: And that will be one of the episodes you record before it goes on a plane.

401
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:48,829
Rym: The only things I have to say about it at a time is that I'd recommend reading it if you never read it.

402
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:51,589
Scott: If you like fantasy novel, this is fantasy now.

403
00:19:52,013 --> 00:19:53,670
Rym: It is so fantasy novel.

404
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:59,170
Rym: It is a series of Chekhov swords that then fire within a few chapters.

405
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,469
Rym: And there's a few more Chekhov swords that have not fired yet.

406
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:07,170
Scott: And then there are eight more books, none of which were written by Chekhov.

407
00:20:09,232 --> 00:20:11,809
Rym: They're not the best books in the world, but I will say this.

408
00:20:12,532 --> 00:20:14,308
Rym: I'm about halfway through the second book now.

409
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:16,850
Scott: Three quarters of the way through the third book.

410
00:20:17,031 --> 00:20:18,490
Rym: I bought the third book.

411
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,330
Scott: Really big books.

412
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,808
Scott: They don't really go by very slowly at all.

413
00:20:22,151 --> 00:20:23,109
Rym: I bought the third book.

414
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:26,410
Rym: I'll probably read it on my travel and we'll see what happens.

415
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:31,330
Scott: The Kindle versions are just as the same price as the paperback versions.

416
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,930
Scott: Of course, you could go RMAT, right?

417
00:20:33,911 --> 00:20:36,250
Scott: But they're DRM free Kindle books, so whatever.

418
00:20:37,233 --> 00:20:40,210
Scott: If it was DRM'd, I probably wouldn't buy the Kindle version, but Amazon points.

419
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:42,610
Rym: And we were at the Penny Arcade Expo.

420
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:43,750
Rym: Videos and things will come.

421
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:46,290
Rym: In the meantime, I burned through some of the queue.

422
00:20:46,491 --> 00:20:50,330
Rym: So I uploaded a video we made at PAX South in San Antonio.

423
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,830
Rym: When Scott and I had some time to kill, we were bored.

424
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:56,250
Rym: And we were already all rigged up with our equipment to go through the expo hall.

425
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:59,250
Scott: It came out worse than I remember, but also better than I remember.

426
00:20:59,771 --> 00:21:00,155
Rym: You know what?

427
00:21:00,235 --> 00:21:01,890
Rym: The worst actually made it better.

428
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:07,450
Rym: It was like this good mix of us laughing at our own jokes and attempting to put this thing together.

429
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:08,677
Rym: But you know what?

430
00:21:08,718 --> 00:21:09,589
Rym: The concept was sound.

431
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:15,130
Rym: And I think what says it all is that I actually laughed when I was watching it while I was trying to edit this thing together.

432
00:21:15,637 --> 00:21:15,942
Scott: Oh, okay.

433
00:21:16,145 --> 00:21:16,429
Scott: I didn't.

434
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:16,822
Rym: I did.

435
00:21:21,735 --> 00:21:22,625
Rym: This was all Scott's idea.

436
00:21:22,645 --> 00:21:23,110
Rym: Just saying.

437
00:21:23,392 --> 00:21:24,027
Scott: We had nothing to do.

438
00:21:24,693 --> 00:21:25,529
Rym: We could have played games.

439
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:26,834
Scott: We did.

440
00:21:26,874 --> 00:21:28,810
Scott: We played as many games as we possibly could play.

441
00:21:29,752 --> 00:21:31,050
Rym: And we're going to be at MAGFest.

442
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:35,149
Rym: But if you didn't get your hotel for MAGFest, we warned you.

443
00:21:35,571 --> 00:21:36,208
Rym: You're fucked now.

444
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:37,770
Scott: Wait, I didn't get a hotel for MAGFest.

445
00:21:38,793 --> 00:21:40,849
Rym: I assume you're in with us and Phil and everybody and J.

446
00:21:41,616 --> 00:21:42,150
Scott: Oh, okay.

447
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,097
Rym: I'll double check to make sure.

448
00:21:43,137 --> 00:21:43,903
Rym: I said we were all in.

449
00:21:43,944 --> 00:21:44,730
Rym: If not, you're fucked.

450
00:21:45,081 --> 00:21:45,329
Scott: Oh, well.

451
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:45,888
Scott: And we're going.

452
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:46,705
Scott: Okay.

453
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:51,349
Rym: MAGFest is now going to be just as hard to go to as PAX East, I think.

454
00:21:53,092 --> 00:22:00,890
Rym: So we're previewing this because we only got to see one episode that had blatantly incorrect made-up subtitles.

455
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:02,929
Rym: I'm getting the disclaimer out now.

456
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:05,049
Rym: Do not watch it until it comes out legit.

457
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,090
Rym: If you watch it early...

458
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:07,910
Scott: This anime is coming out early October.

459
00:22:08,712 --> 00:22:09,445
Scott: It's highly anticipated.

460
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:13,390
Scott: There are many trailers and teasers on YouTube and such that you can watch.

461
00:22:14,311 --> 00:22:19,430
Scott: But they streamed the first episode on NicoNicoLive as a preview.

462
00:22:20,231 --> 00:22:24,410
Scott: Of course, people captured that and poorly subtitled it and it's low-res.

463
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:25,374
Scott: Yeah, we're watching.

464
00:22:25,414 --> 00:22:28,270
Rym: and Emily just started translating because the subtitles were...

465
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:29,303
Scott: And Emily's like, "That subtitle's

466
00:22:29,344 --> 00:22:29,607
Scott: wrong.".

467
00:22:29,952 --> 00:22:31,390
Scott: And it was super wrong.

468
00:22:32,112 --> 00:22:35,228
Rym: At one point, a guy's like, "It will make you the strongest in the

469
00:22:35,268 --> 00:22:35,510
Rym: world.".

470
00:22:35,632 --> 00:22:36,085
Rym: Emily's like...

471
00:22:36,351 --> 00:22:38,729
Scott: He said that it tastes like strawberry drink.

472
00:22:39,336 --> 00:22:39,420
Rym: Yep.

473
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:41,107
Rym: And it's like, "Oh, it's not even

474
00:22:41,188 --> 00:22:41,370
Rym: close."

475
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:45,650
Rym: Where the subtitle just says "IDK" because whoever did it couldn't actually translate.

476
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:49,390
Scott: Right, so it's going to be on a legal streaming site, I'm sure, because it's super licensed.

477
00:22:49,992 --> 00:22:50,909
Scott: It's going to be a big hit.

478
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,610
Scott: But this is the One Punch Man.

479
00:22:53,752 --> 00:22:56,910
Scott: One Punch Man was getting so much talking and on Twitter that I had to check it out.

480
00:22:57,030 --> 00:23:00,729
Scott: I read a whole bunch of the manga maybe about a year ago.

481
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:03,470
Rym: So, Scott, what is One Punch Man about?

482
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:04,427
Scott: So, there's this guy.

483
00:23:05,411 --> 00:23:08,370
Scott: And he was just like a normal, totally normal dude.

484
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:10,570
Rym: And then he got bit by a radioactive spider or something?

485
00:23:10,777 --> 00:23:10,985
Scott: No.

486
00:23:12,737 --> 00:23:13,889
Scott: And he couldn't get a job.

487
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:17,030
Scott: And he was sort of dismayed with life or whatever.

488
00:23:17,671 --> 00:23:18,656
Scott: So he said, "You know what?

489
00:23:19,379 --> 00:23:20,484
Scott: I'm just going to be a hero for

490
00:23:20,946 --> 00:23:21,046
Scott: fun.".

491
00:23:22,012 --> 00:23:23,430
Scott: So he decides to become a hero.

492
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:28,190
Scott: And to train to be a hero every day, he does 100 push-ups every day.

493
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:30,238
Scott: 100 push-ups and 100 sit-ups and 100 squats.

494
00:23:33,232 --> 00:23:35,590
Scott: And he runs 10K every single day.

495
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:37,229
Rym: I could do that if I didn't have a job.

496
00:23:37,651 --> 00:23:38,348
Scott: Yeah, he didn't have a job.

497
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:39,409
Scott: So he did that every single day.

498
00:23:39,631 --> 00:23:42,570
Rym: So if I quit my job and do that, can I kill anyone in one punch?

499
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:46,770
Scott: He trained so hard that all his hair fell out and his head became super shiny.

500
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:47,249
Scott: Deal breaker.

501
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:55,450
Scott: And he became so powerful that any bad guy he punches goes down in one punch.

502
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:59,790
Scott: His one punch is so ridiculously strong that he is now One Punch Man.

503
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:03,270
Rym: Now that there is an animated television series of One Punch Man.

504
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:04,558
Scott: I mean, it was already popular.

505
00:24:04,578 --> 00:24:06,390
Scott: Now it's going to be double popular with everyone.

506
00:24:06,591 --> 00:24:09,909
Scott: I saw maybe one cosplay of it in the past year or two.

507
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,570
Scott: You're going to see so many punchmans.

508
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:17,890
Rym: I have to redact/update a bunch of panels and lectures we've done for the past decade.

509
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:24,324
Rym: Because for a long time, I have said, and so has Scott, that the greatest punch in the history of anime is Big O.

510
00:24:25,972 --> 00:24:28,070
Scott: The One Punch Man has pretty much taken over.

511
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:31,570
Scott: I mean, it combines pretty much the best elements.

512
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:34,410
Scott: This is sort of like the be-all end-all of anime, right?

513
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:36,450
Rym: Wasn't that Kill La Kill?

514
00:24:37,536 --> 00:24:37,900
Scott: Well, no.

515
00:24:37,981 --> 00:24:38,890
Scott: Kill La Kill saved anime.

516
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:42,590
Scott: It's already been saved, which is why One Punch Man can exist, right?

517
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:43,850
Scott: In the saved anime universe.

518
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:49,070
Scott: It has the ridiculousness and action scenes of the Kill La Kill, right?

519
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:57,170
Scott: It has the crazy visual stylings and random crazy characters of a Space Dandy kind of situation.

520
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:59,790
Rym: Well, it's directed by the person who directed Space Dandy.

521
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:00,346
Scott: How about that?

522
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:07,767
Scott: It brings in the punch and the epicness of violence of, say, a Big O, or a Fist of the North Star.

523
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:13,326
Rym: Well, it brings in not just the epic violence and the punch, but the viscera and gore of the 90s.

524
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:19,170
Rym: I mean, dude pulls an entire crab out of his body by the eyeball.

525
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:22,950
Scott: And then it brings in the shounen-ness of the Dragon Ball, right?

526
00:25:23,351 --> 00:25:33,530
Scott: All together into this one, like, the be-all end-all singularity of shounen action manga anime that ever must exist.

527
00:25:34,692 --> 00:25:36,283
Scott: There's no reason to make any more, right?

528
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,438
Scott: It's like One Piece, right?

529
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:39,769
Scott: It's got the One Piece in there, too.

530
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:41,717
Scott: It's Madhouse.

531
00:25:42,381 --> 00:25:44,010
Rym: The opening theme is Jam Project.

532
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:46,609
Rym: It's a who's who in a lot of ways.

533
00:25:47,191 --> 00:25:51,150
Scott: It is the shounen anime of all time.

534
00:25:51,431 --> 00:25:53,890
Scott: And its first episode is even, like, half out yet.

535
00:25:54,090 --> 00:26:00,341
Rym: This is the kind of anime that when I was going to anime cons when I was younger, I'd actually be like, "Oh my god, there's a new anime!

536
00:26:00,361 --> 00:26:00,844
Rym: I'm gonna watch the

537
00:26:00,884 --> 00:26:01,267
Rym: screening!".

538
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:09,670
Rym: It's the kind of thing that I expect to see at an anime con with the screening, and a whole bunch of people go to see it, and a bunch of cosplay, people getting really into it.

539
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:11,829
Rym: Bald guys, your day has come.

540
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:15,026
Scott: So I've read the manga, so I know some things that weren't in the first episode.

541
00:26:15,046 --> 00:26:15,710
Scott: the rhythm doesn't know.

542
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:19,369
Scott: For example, there's a sidekick, and...

543
00:26:19,651 --> 00:26:20,529
Rym: Why would you kick?

544
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:23,050
Scott: No, there's a character who's a sidekick who's awesome.

545
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:25,990
Scott: He's like a cyborg, and he actually knows about being a hero.

546
00:26:26,532 --> 00:26:32,510
Scott: And there's an organization that manages all heroes on Earth, and the heroes have different grades and levels.

547
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:37,409
Scott: So they're trying to level out to be higher grade heroes to get more monies or whatever.

548
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:44,869
Scott: There's this whole structure that gets involved and stuff, but really, you just want to see him punch something one time.

549
00:26:45,653 --> 00:26:49,307
Rym: The opening song's name is "Set Fire to the Furious

550
00:26:49,488 --> 00:26:49,789
Rym: Fist."

551
00:26:50,873 --> 00:26:51,849
Rym: I think it's already on fire.

552
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:58,930
Scott: But, you know, it's so... You know, it's like, Kenshiro knows that when he punches someone, they're gonna explode, right?

553
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:00,710
Rym: But he punches him, like, a hundred times!

554
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,610
Scott: Right, and so does One Punch Man.

555
00:27:03,291 --> 00:27:05,622
Scott: One Punch Man is sort of like, "Eh, punch.

556
00:27:06,104 --> 00:27:06,426
Scott: Phew.

557
00:27:06,707 --> 00:27:07,109
Scott: Whatever.".

558
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:08,354
Rym: He also doesn't wait.

559
00:27:08,454 --> 00:27:13,290
Rym: Kenshiro will sort of wait, and, like, fight his way through a bunch of minions.

560
00:27:13,491 --> 00:27:15,025
Rym: This guy's just like, "Straight to the boss.

561
00:27:15,065 --> 00:27:15,247
Scott: Punch

562
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:15,368
Scott: him.".

563
00:27:15,931 --> 00:27:20,287
Scott: His name is Saitama, and it's like, he wants to save the world.

564
00:27:21,953 --> 00:27:29,968
Scott: He doesn't want the world to die, but he doesn't care too much, whereas Kenshiro will be like, "Use these ten seconds to think about your

565
00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:30,350
Scott: sins.".

566
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:31,910
Scott: You know?

567
00:27:33,292 --> 00:27:34,320
Scott: That kind of shit.

568
00:27:34,381 --> 00:27:35,389
Scott: He doesn't do that, right?

569
00:27:35,752 --> 00:27:36,298
Scott: Maybe he should.

570
00:27:36,661 --> 00:27:37,530
Scott: Maybe he will eventually.

571
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:42,549
Rym: But the show's got just the crazy animation, like what we saw with "Kill la

572
00:27:42,569 --> 00:27:42,750
Rym: Kill."

573
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:45,990
Rym: This is really bendy, squashy, weirdy.

574
00:27:46,471 --> 00:27:52,184
Rym: Like, when he jumps and punches, you see his whole torso, like, tarred, and the fist, like, bends into the punch.

575
00:27:52,224 --> 00:27:53,230
Rym: It looks great.

576
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:57,490
Scott: They have to capture, even in highly pixelated stream rips, right?

577
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,890
Scott: It looks great, so the real one probably looks even better.

578
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:10,910
Scott: But the manga, you know, I think actually, compared to the first episode, I think the manga actually does a better job of, like, conveying the epicness of punching something one time, right?

579
00:28:10,991 --> 00:28:13,730
Scott: And it's mostly because the bad guys start escalating, you know?

580
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:18,829
Scott: And it's like he punches, you know, what, in episode one of the anime, he punched Crablante once.

581
00:28:19,272 --> 00:28:22,669
Scott: Well, and he didn't actually even punch Crablante, or he killed him using a different method.

582
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:27,250
Rym: Yeah, pulling his entire viscera system out of his body through his eye socket.

583
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:30,349
Scott: Yeah, but he punched quite a, you know, that giant guy once.

584
00:28:30,658 --> 00:28:30,909
Scott: Oh, yeah.

585
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,270
Scott: He punched some other guys once, right?

586
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:41,852
Scott: But when he starts punching, like, the real bad guys once, and you start seeing, like, you know, they start, when all the other heroes start showing up and all these other characters, you sort of get.

587
00:28:41,893 --> 00:28:53,669
Scott: the relativity aspect of it comes into play, where it's, like, the most powerful hero on Earth is, like, you know, Superman, basically, is, like, having a tough time, and then One Punch Man punches that bad guy once.

588
00:28:54,472 --> 00:29:06,570
Rym: Well, it's got this nice idea of escalation, which a lot of, like, the indie comics and the kinds of things we like, like, if you see enough tropes and you see enough stories, you start to get to the point where you want to see, like, the culmination of that kind of story.

589
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:08,970
Rym: Like, this is the culmination of the superhero story.

590
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:16,450
Rym: What if you had the literally invincible, all-powerful, well, at least all-powerful in terms of beating bad guys guy?

591
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:20,850
Scott: Like, push it all the way to the end and see what kind of story you have.

592
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:31,130
Scott: Right, but to make it interesting, right, it's interesting because of the character that he is, right, is while he's super powerful, punch everyone once and they die, you know, it's, like, he's really sort of bored.

593
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:36,010
Scott: Like, he wants a super awesome fight to be an awesome hero and have fun with it, but, like, he's not having fun with it.

594
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:37,689
Scott: He just punches everyone once and it's over.

595
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,848
Scott: And he's like, "Oh, God, this is so

596
00:29:39,868 --> 00:29:40,030
Scott: boring.".

597
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:44,390
Scott: Right, and it's, like, he escaped the life of, you know, looking for a job.

598
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:46,330
Scott: He gave up on that because it sucks so much.

599
00:29:46,491 --> 00:29:50,649
Scott: Now he's got this hero job and it sucks just as much because he's so good at it.

600
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:52,430
Rym: But, meanwhile, like, D in Vampire Hunter D.

601
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:53,410
Scott: I can really relate to that.

602
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:56,130
Scott: Like, at work, I type everything once and then it's boring.

603
00:29:56,552 --> 00:29:57,169
Rym: One type man.

604
00:29:57,371 --> 00:29:57,870
Scott: I'm one type man.

605
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:59,550
Rym: Touch the keyboard once, the problem's solved.

606
00:29:59,872 --> 00:30:00,968
Scott: That's pretty much what I do.

607
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:01,397
Rym: Yeah.

608
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:06,150
Rym: But, like, D, because I watched some old Vampire Hunter D again recently.

609
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:08,228
Rym: There's a midnight screening of it at a local theater, too.

610
00:30:10,031 --> 00:30:14,210
Rym: He is just as, like, it's the same as one punch man, except it's, like, one sword slash man.

611
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:16,970
Rym: He just wins every fight automatically because he's Alucard.

612
00:30:17,652 --> 00:30:19,790
Scott: But Alucard doesn't have the same personality.

613
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:23,710
Rym: Well, no, D has no personality and gives zero fucks about anything.

614
00:30:24,495 --> 00:30:25,550
Rym: He just wins.

615
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:28,583
Rym: Every fight is, "Oh, D, I've beaten you.

616
00:30:28,603 --> 00:30:28,684
Rym: Nope.".

617
00:30:30,991 --> 00:30:31,333
Scott: Yeah, there's.

618
00:30:31,373 --> 00:30:38,970
Scott: no, that's another thing, is that there's no suspense of, you know, is usually when there's a fighting story, right?

619
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:42,630
Rym: Well, like, initial D. At the end, like, we talked about this when we reviewed it.

620
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:50,867
Rym: Even in episode 25, when you know he's gonna win because he wins every fucking race, Itsuki's like, "I don't think he's gonna win it this

621
00:30:50,908 --> 00:30:51,089
Rym: time.".

622
00:30:51,292 --> 00:30:52,769
Rym: And you're like, "Well, what if he doesn't?

623
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,142
Rym: I mean, that car is real

624
00:30:54,202 --> 00:30:54,668
Rym: fast.".

625
00:30:54,950 --> 00:31:01,190
Scott: Yeah, but there's no suspense in one punch man if Saitama is gonna get hurt or injured or die.

626
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:03,890
Scott: It's like, you just accept the fact that he's invincible.

627
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:11,317
Scott: Like, he doesn't, you know, once you see him get, like, ridiculously, like, punched a zillion times and, like, he's unharmed, like, not even a scratch, it's like, "Oh,

628
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:12,070
Scott: okay.".

629
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:18,130
Scott: And you don't even, like, you're never concerned that anything, like, Kenshiro sometimes is like, "Oh, shit, is he gonna lose to this guy?

630
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:19,103
Scott: He's actually really

631
00:31:19,144 --> 00:31:19,509
Scott: powerful?".

632
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,643
Scott: And he gets hurt.

633
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:24,090
Scott: I mean, he's got those seven scars in his chest for a reason, right?

634
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:33,789
Rym: The Shonen fighting trope is to make the character actually invincible but continue to escalate to trick you into doubting for a second that he's gonna make it.

635
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,629
Rym: But then he makes it in the end anyway.

636
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:38,290
Scott: There's no question that he's gonna make it, right?

637
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:42,070
Scott: It's just, a lot of the suspense is like, "When is he gonna punch him?

638
00:31:42,412 --> 00:31:43,368
Scott: Is he gonna punch him?

639
00:31:44,033 --> 00:31:46,168
Scott: Is this guy so strong that the punch won't

640
00:31:46,188 --> 00:31:46,370
Scott: work?".

641
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:48,670
Scott: You're never worried about Saitama being hurt.

642
00:31:49,231 --> 00:31:52,630
Rym: So it skips, like, every trope of a Shonen show.

643
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:58,970
Scott: Well, but there's also other characters such as the awesome cyborg sidekick who can get hurt, right?

644
00:31:59,091 --> 00:32:01,250
Scott: And it's like, "Oh, are those people gonna get hurt?

645
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:02,262
Scott: Is he gonna save them in

646
00:32:02,303 --> 00:32:02,708
Scott: time?".

647
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:05,490
Scott: You know, those sorts of things are still coming to play a little bit.

648
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:10,690
Rym: Well, I mean, I like how it's city A and then everyone moved to city B because city A got destroyed in a fight.

649
00:32:10,751 --> 00:32:12,570
Scott: It just doesn't hold back, right?

650
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:18,008
Scott: It just, you know, it doesn't even bother trying to hide, like, the Shonen structure, right?

651
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:22,067
Scott: By making it, you know, in Dragon Ball, they're like power level 9000, right?

652
00:32:22,751 --> 00:32:25,230
Scott: They're trying to hide it a little bit, right?

653
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:27,429
Scott: One Punch Man doesn't even try to hide it.

654
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:36,348
Scott: They're like, "Let us form a structure of Shonen leveling up that we will now, is easily translated into video games, but is a parody because we're making it so

655
00:32:36,408 --> 00:32:36,650
Scott: explicit.".

656
00:32:37,271 --> 00:32:39,390
Rym: It's almost a deconstruction.

657
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:40,375
Scott: But it's not.

658
00:32:40,517 --> 00:32:41,950
Scott: It is the perfect construction.

659
00:32:43,433 --> 00:32:46,870
Scott: It is when, you know, you can't deconstruct something by being the same.

660
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:50,650
Rym: Well, one could say the struggle is everything but the battle.

661
00:32:50,831 --> 00:32:55,050
Scott: By making the perfect example of a thing, you are not deconstructing that thing.

662
00:32:55,211 --> 00:32:59,049
Scott: You are simply constructing the best possible example of that thing.

663
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:05,390
Rym: It's not perfect because the perfect example does all those other tropes and goes through the cycle of doubt and belief and doubt and belief.

664
00:33:06,051 --> 00:33:08,010
Rym: This is, it's going beyond the cycle.

665
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:11,350
Rym: It's going past all that to all the other stuff.

666
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:17,009
Scott: There comes a point where you can't tell the difference between parody and the real thing, and that is what One Punch Man is.

667
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:18,969
Scott: It is at the pinnacle of it.

668
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:24,870
Scott: You cannot possibly go any higher onto the top of Mount Everest when the pointy bit is in your asshole.

669
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:26,649
Scott: That is the end of the line.

670
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:30,510
Rym: That pointy bit is where either the best or the worst media are.

671
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:31,807
Scott: This is the best one.

672
00:33:32,456 --> 00:33:32,524
Rym: Yup.

673
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:42,310
Scott: But, you know, the worst one could be right alongside it because two people can be on the point at the same time if they can stand on, like, one atom of pointiness on their toe or something.

674
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:44,270
Rym: But then you get into quantum physics and causality.

675
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:44,853
Rym: Whatever.

676
00:33:44,893 --> 00:33:54,429
Scott: But yeah, if you care anything about anime at all, even if you don't care about anime, and maybe you've thought about all those other anime we've mentioned, you don't need to watch all those.

677
00:33:55,993 --> 00:34:05,110
Scott: Just watch/read One Punch Man, and you will not need to see any other punches, watch any other shounen animes, or read any of the shounen mangas.

678
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:06,610
Scott: This is the one.

679
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:08,469
Scott: We don't need anyone to make any more.

680
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:10,730
Scott: If you're writing one right now, just throw it in the garbage.

681
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:13,429
Scott: Work on some shoujo or something.

682
00:34:13,792 --> 00:34:16,830
Scott: In fact, make the shoujo, like, One Kiss Girl or something.

683
00:34:18,734 --> 00:34:19,809
Scott: You know, because I want to read that.

684
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:21,259
Rym: I would read that.

685
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,089
Rym: I would watch that.

686
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:24,670
Scott: And then I want to see the mashup, One Kiss Girl, One Punch Man.

687
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:25,472
Rym: I looked.

688
00:34:25,672 --> 00:34:31,330
Rym: No one has drawn fanart of One Punch Man and Big O with the second punch, tier two punch.

689
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:32,889
Scott: At least you haven't found such fanart.

690
00:34:33,031 --> 00:34:35,489
Rym: I just searched for, like, five minutes and couldn't find it.

691
00:34:35,792 --> 00:34:36,909
Scott: Well, searching Japanese.

692
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:44,027
Rym: But seriously, while you should watch this show, just wait for it to be out legit, because-- It'll be out legit so soon.

693
00:34:44,409 --> 00:34:52,768
Scott: The non-legit version-- Next month is going to be the month of One Punch Man comes to America and punches every anime fan right in the junk, whatever kind of junk you got.

694
00:34:53,172 --> 00:34:53,989
Scott: It's getting punched.

695
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:56,188
Rym: When he punches that one subterranean-- And it's only going to take once.

696
00:34:56,489 --> 00:34:58,589
Rym: He definitely punches him right in the dick.

697
00:34:58,851 --> 00:34:59,150
Rym: Oh, yeah.

698
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:00,770
Rym: Like, right in the dick.

699
00:35:00,911 --> 00:35:01,509
Scott: I mean, why not?

700
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:06,330
Scott: If you didn't punch him right in the dick, that show would be a slight step lower on the Mount Everest.

701
00:35:09,112 --> 00:35:11,489
Rym: So, yeah, hopefully we'll have a bunch of Ginkgoz episodes up.

702
00:35:11,935 --> 00:35:13,070
Rym: We're going to trickle them out to you.

703
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:15,109
Rym: We're going to record as many as we can before I fly.

704
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:22,050
Rym: And starting in October, we'll actually be back in town doing our normal stuff.

705
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:24,809
Rym: And we're going to start ramping up video production of things.

706
00:35:26,033 --> 00:35:26,509
Rym: So stay tuned.

707
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,340
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

708
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:39,460
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

709
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:44,860
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

710
00:35:45,142 --> 00:35:47,820
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

711
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:52,560
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

712

Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

713
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:00,360
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

714
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:03,500
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

715
00:36:26,232 --> 00:36:28,990
Scott: Uh... You're not as loud as you were before.

716
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:31,332
Rym: Bop.

717
00:36:32,534 --> 00:36:32,577
Scott: Eh.

718
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:33,213
Rym: Bop.

719
00:36:33,865 --> 00:36:33,907
Scott: Eh.

720
00:36:34,931 --> 00:36:35,888
Scott: Might be even too quiet.

721
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:36,261
Scott: Bop.

722
00:36:38,334 --> 00:36:38,666
Scott: Bop.

723
00:36:39,073 --> 00:36:39,310
Scott: Fart.

724
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:40,080
Scott: Poop.

725
00:36:41,053 --> 00:36:41,410
Scott: Poop fart.
