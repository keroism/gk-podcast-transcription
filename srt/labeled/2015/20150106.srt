1
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:11,984
Rym: Good afternoon everyone.

2
00:00:12,004 --> 00:00:18,764
Rym: So how many of you are here because you saw my lecture yesterday on winning?

3
00:00:19,908 --> 00:00:20,269
Rym: Oh wow.

4
00:00:20,811 --> 00:00:23,221
Rym: So for those of you who weren't here, I'm going to let you in on a secret.

5
00:00:23,241 --> 00:00:23,702
Rym: I didn't tell them.

6
00:00:23,743 --> 00:00:30,911
Rym: The entire video of the last time we did that lecture, we meaning me and my co-host from PAX Prime, is on YouTube.

7
00:00:30,992 --> 00:00:38,424
Rym: So if you like this at all, what I'm about to do for the next hour, the video of what you missed is on YouTube except there's some other jerk on stage alongside me.

8
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,417
Rym: So losing is the topic of this panel.

9
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:46,454
Rym: and to give a little bit of preface, for those of you who don't know who I am, my name is Rym.

10
00:00:46,857 --> 00:00:50,714
Rym: I'm the producer of a podcast called GeekNights along with my co-host Scott.

11
00:00:50,995 --> 00:00:55,614
Rym: I've also lectured at every single Penny Arcade Expo including Australia, East, West.

12
00:00:55,935 --> 00:01:06,267
Rym: I will be at South in January since 2008 and I'm also the executive producer for a video game company called Date Naito and Date Naito makes visual novels.

13
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:09,958
Rym: So today we are here to explore losing.

14
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:14,328
Rym: Now are any of you familiar with a game called Dwarf Fortress?

15
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:18,979
Rym: Dwarf Fortress is a very interesting game.

16
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:27,993
Rym: Dwarf Fortress, for example, this is the aftermath of a scene of what I would call high drama or what Dwarf Fortress fans would call high fun.

17
00:01:28,615 --> 00:01:30,020
Rym: There was a goblin attack I believe.

18
00:01:30,821 --> 00:01:41,020
Rym: So we interviewed Tarn Adams long ago on GeekNights about Dwarf Fortress and one of the very interesting things he said to us was that Dwarf Fortress, losing isn't just inevitable.

19
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,484
Rym: I mean it's inevitable.

20
00:01:42,524 --> 00:01:44,230
Rym: Your fortress is going to collapse.

21
00:01:44,331 --> 00:01:52,082
Rym: Eventually that last dwarf weeping bitter and alone is going to die in the depths of his dungeon barricaded against the goblin hordes outside.

22
00:01:52,444 --> 00:01:56,096
Rym: and when he dies, that is the greatest moment of your fortress.

23
00:01:56,758 --> 00:01:58,262
Rym: Losing isn't just fun.

24
00:01:58,683 --> 00:02:01,391
Rym: Losing is the point of Dwarf Fortress.

25
00:02:02,193 --> 00:02:09,722
Rym: So that got us thinking and years ago at another Penny Arcade Expo we did a panel called Losing Should Be Fun which unfortunately no record of that exists.

26
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:11,167
Rym: There's no video of us doing that.

27
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:19,280
Rym: So my co-host for whatever reason hated that panel, hated talking about it, hated this thing and he didn't fly to Australia.

28
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,726
Rym: so guess what I get to do while I'm here?

29
00:02:20,747 --> 00:02:27,796
Rym: Of course I upped it a little bit because since then the Dwarf Fortress community has embraced this idea of fun.

30
00:02:27,877 --> 00:02:32,734
Rym: If you know someone who plays Dwarf Fortress, the word fun does not mean fun to them.

31
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,263
Rym: The word fun means something very specific.

32
00:02:35,744 --> 00:02:44,228
Rym: So the overall theme of this is simply that losing is fun, losing is interesting and losing is possibly an integral part of gaming.

33
00:02:45,372 --> 00:02:47,620
Rym: So let's talk about a history of losing.

34
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:53,399
Rym: In the old days, for most of video game history at least, there was no such thing as winning.

35
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,245
Rym: You couldn't win Dig Dug.

36
00:02:55,486 --> 00:02:56,791
Rym: You could get a high score.

37
00:02:57,032 --> 00:02:59,803
Rym: You could beat your opponent in a high score contest.

38
00:03:00,044 --> 00:03:02,536
Rym: You could beat some arbitrary goal like a high score.

39
00:03:02,576 --> 00:03:03,982
Rym: You keep saying high score, that's all there is.

40
00:03:04,524 --> 00:03:07,596
Rym: These games did not end in a sense that you did not win them.

41
00:03:07,656 --> 00:03:15,644
Rym: You played until you could not play anymore either because you sucked or because programmers never even conceived that anyone would spend that much time.

42
00:03:15,664 --> 00:03:23,921
Rym: So the idea of winning is a very new thing relative to video games.

43
00:03:24,282 --> 00:03:25,866
Rym: Winning is not something we had before.

44
00:03:25,967 --> 00:03:27,691
Rym: Losing was the default.

45
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:39,608
Rym: So a while ago some games came out and those games, there were games before these, but these are iconic of an idea that suddenly a game wasn't just a series of challenges that eventually end in your failure.

46
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:43,382
Rym: Games are series of challenges that rewarded you if you completed them.

47
00:03:43,402 --> 00:03:44,888
Rym: Games could be won.

48
00:03:44,928 --> 00:03:47,640
Rym: Not only could they be won, but they had endings.

49
00:03:48,162 --> 00:04:12,643
Rym: I don't know if any of you are young enough to remember those heady days where your friend, you know there were no smartphones, there's barely even internet, my friend Joe called me on the phone, he called my parents on the phone at about 11 at night, which when you're in elementary school that is not cool, to tell me that he had just beaten Final Fantasy 1 and that if I ran over to his house I could see the ending.

50
00:04:13,285 --> 00:04:14,990
Rym: He wouldn't hit A until I got there.

51
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:20,267
Rym: My parents didn't understand or care about this, but I would seek these endings.

52
00:04:20,308 --> 00:04:26,250
Rym: These endings validated every single trouble and pain and hardship every time I threw the controller at the ground.

53
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:31,874
Rym: These endings justified that or they maybe literally want to throw the game away.

54
00:04:31,894 --> 00:04:47,214
Rym: The narrative of Super Mario Brothers is that Mario saves the princess.

55
00:04:47,656 --> 00:04:56,209
Rym: The story is not Mario died on the first Goomba, the story is not Mario died on the eighth Goomba, or the first hammer brother, or the second hammer brother, or the third hammer brother.

56
00:04:56,751 --> 00:04:59,119
Rym: Every death in Mario is the same.

57
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:02,812
Rym: There is one narrative and that narrative is you won the game.

58
00:05:02,873 --> 00:05:07,610
Rym: That narrative is you're rewarded for beating the challenges you have faced up to this point.

59
00:05:08,152 --> 00:05:12,483
Rym: So losing is nothing more than a consequence, something to give you a challenge.

60
00:05:13,385 --> 00:05:27,997
Rym: Now we can thus, while we can talk about games aesthetics, we can talk about art and story and all these things, the only way to judge the game part, the playing part, is by the nature of those challenges and the nature of the reward.

61
00:05:28,017 --> 00:05:30,549
Rym: Many people would argue that games have to be difficult.

62
00:05:30,589 --> 00:05:33,201
Rym: If a game is too easy then it's not really even a game.

63
00:05:33,703 --> 00:05:36,292
Rym: So Super Meat Boy is an excellent example of this.

64
00:05:36,332 --> 00:05:42,275
Rym: This is a game that is difficult to the point of tears and yet a lot of people in this room seem to really like this game.

65
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:46,349
Rym: Why do we like this game but we don't like Silver Surfer?

66
00:05:47,011 --> 00:05:49,620
Rym: Silver Surfer is way harder than Super Meat Boy.

67
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,828
Rym: Silver Surfer however is not fun.

68
00:05:52,929 --> 00:05:55,397
Rym: Why is this difficult and horrifying?

69
00:05:55,417 --> 00:05:57,866
Rym: and this is difficult and you exult in that difficulty.

70
00:05:58,809 --> 00:06:02,200
Rym: One interesting thing is the way the rewards are presented to you.

71
00:06:02,621 --> 00:06:03,182
Rym: The rewards.

72
00:06:03,242 --> 00:06:06,671
Rym: in a game, maybe a reward is worth 10 fun points.

73
00:06:07,392 --> 00:06:14,173
Rym: but if you suffered -50 fun points on the way to those 10 fun points you get a total fun of 60.

74
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:19,110
Rym: The deeper you go into the depths of madness when you finally come out on top.

75
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,438
Rym: that is the most rewarding experience in the world.

76
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,826
Rym: But if you go too deep you give up.

77
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:28,321
Rym: Or you get the Ghostbusters ending and then it wasn't even worth it.

78
00:06:29,404 --> 00:06:31,551
Rym: So Super Meat Boy does something very interesting.

79
00:06:32,113 --> 00:06:37,955
Rym: It increases the reward you get the longer you have attempted and failed to complete a level.

80
00:06:38,477 --> 00:06:47,155
Rym: In Super Meat Boy for those of you who haven't played it as you play every time your little meat boy goes through and dies in some gruesome way it records that and it keeps recording that.

81
00:06:47,195 --> 00:06:49,624
Rym: If I try a thousand times there are a thousand recordings.

82
00:06:49,664 --> 00:06:58,330
Rym: so eventually when I beat Super Meat Boy when I beat that level I see all those little meat boys coalescing into the one motherfucker who made it.

83
00:06:58,671 --> 00:07:04,812
Rym: So as a result the game is scaling its reward based on my effort.

84
00:07:04,832 --> 00:07:05,535
Rym: and what does this do?

85
00:07:05,616 --> 00:07:06,520
Rym: You've all been in this boat.

86
00:07:06,821 --> 00:07:14,469
Rym: you stay up it's 12 at night you want to go to bed you need to go to bed but you've got like 4,000 meat boys just waiting for you.

87
00:07:14,529 --> 00:07:15,593
Rym: Are you gonna throw that away?

88
00:07:15,613 --> 00:07:17,100
Rym: Are you gonna give that up?

89
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,624
Rym: What about punishment?

90
00:07:19,966 --> 00:07:20,990
Rym: Has anyone here played?

91
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:23,200
Rym: this is a game that is it seems kind of niche.

92
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,907
Rym: it's called Five Nights at Freddy's.

93
00:07:24,947 --> 00:07:27,216
Rym: Has anyone here played Five Nights at Freddy's?

94
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:27,959
Rym: Wow.

95
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:33,698
Rym: Okay this is a kind of small indie weird game and I don't want to spoil a lot about it.

96
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:36,612
Rym: If you'd all played it I was gonna get a lot more into the mechanics of this game.

97
00:07:37,114 --> 00:07:39,423
Rym: So the deal with this game short game.

98
00:07:40,024 --> 00:07:42,892
Rym: you're a dude you're making minimum wage in the United States.

99
00:07:44,235 --> 00:07:48,708
Rym: That laugh was a little too real there.

100
00:07:49,590 --> 00:08:01,331
Rym: And you can move you sit in a room you can look a little bit to the left you can look a little bit to the right you can flick the lights on in the hallways outside your room and you can close either or both of the doors.

101
00:08:01,852 --> 00:08:07,030
Rym: All these things use power and if the power runs out the lights go off and the doors cannot be closed.

102
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,235
Rym: if they're closed they open.

103
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:11,127
Rym: You're a security guard from midnight to 6 a.m.

104
00:08:11,148 --> 00:08:11,730
Rym: for five nights.

105
00:08:11,831 --> 00:08:18,165
Rym: at Freddy Fazbear's Entertainment and at Freddy Fazbear's Entertainment the animatronics move around at night because otherwise their servers look at all jacked up.

106
00:08:18,868 --> 00:08:22,222
Rym: And if they see a human they think it's an exoskeleton that isn't in its suit.

107
00:08:22,744 --> 00:08:24,270
Rym: So they kindly put you in a suit.

108
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,979
Rym: Now if you're a human being that horribly kills you.

109
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,688
Rym: So if these things see you they kill you.

110
00:08:31,471 --> 00:08:32,995
Rym: And the game is a horror game.

111
00:08:33,035 --> 00:08:38,554
Rym: it's one of the first and I would argue best horror games that has ever been made as a video game.

112
00:08:38,876 --> 00:08:43,217
Rym: Because many people when they think of horror games like Resident Evil those are more survival horror.

113
00:08:43,258 --> 00:08:46,933
Rym: those are a narrative of you achieving of you conquering of you winning.

114
00:08:47,254 --> 00:08:49,182
Rym: losing is just you dying along the line.

115
00:08:49,202 --> 00:08:58,173
Rym: In this game not only is it a horror in the sense that it's existential it's horror in the sense that it punishes you when you lose in a very visceral way.

116
00:08:58,834 --> 00:08:59,636
Rym: It jump scares you.

117
00:09:00,078 --> 00:09:01,924
Rym: Now jump scares aren't horror right?

118
00:09:02,226 --> 00:09:05,622
Rym: People always say oh that game wasn't scary it's just dead things jumping out of.

119
00:09:05,843 --> 00:09:10,004
Rym: you know you walk past a weird window and something jumps at you and there's a locker room or something jumped at you.

120
00:09:10,205 --> 00:09:12,597
Rym: So when things are jumping at you that's like cheap horror.

121
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:16,092
Rym: This game tells you straight up this is a jump scare game.

122
00:09:16,413 --> 00:09:17,397
Rym: we're gonna jump scare you.

123
00:09:17,618 --> 00:09:25,737
Rym: and then it puts you in it and you look to the left look to the right and then you pull up this monitor and you can see the security cameras and you see that the animatronics are all on the stage.

124
00:09:26,119 --> 00:09:26,902
Rym: and then you look around.

125
00:09:26,943 --> 00:09:28,069
Rym: you look back at the animatronics.

126
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:28,913
Rym: one of them's gone.

127
00:09:28,933 --> 00:09:30,179
Rym: Where the fuck did that rabbit go?

128
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,365
Rym: Where's that rabbit?

129
00:09:31,465 --> 00:09:32,190
Rym: Where's that rabbit?

130
00:09:32,411 --> 00:09:34,784
Rym: And eventually you're sitting there and you start to get really paranoid.

131
00:09:34,884 --> 00:09:40,385
Rym: I'm not a fazeable person and when I was playing this game my girlfriend was standing next to me kind of half watching.

132
00:09:41,429 --> 00:09:44,000
Rym: I thought I'm a big man I can get through this.

133
00:09:44,341 --> 00:09:49,042
Rym: Though the power went out I knew that asshole was in the room with me and I knew there's gonna be a jump scare.

134
00:09:49,062 --> 00:09:50,349
Rym: I knew this game was gonna punish me.

135
00:09:50,671 --> 00:09:51,837
Rym: So I'm just waiting for the punishment.

136
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:59,263
Rym: I kind of leaned back from the monitor like all right I don't want to jump I don't want to be afraid and nothing happens.

137
00:09:59,604 --> 00:10:01,291
Rym: nothing happens and nothing happens.

138
00:10:01,593 --> 00:10:04,644
Rym: and I lean in a little bit and I move the mouse to be like did the game crash?

139
00:10:04,664 --> 00:10:05,326
Rym: and then it got me.

140
00:10:08,335 --> 00:10:16,204
Rym: The game scared the ever-living shit out of me even though I knew it was the jump scare and it makes my adrenaline pound and the game teaches you paranoia.

141
00:10:16,224 --> 00:10:25,523
Rym: But winning the game the only thing you get for winning is your minimum wage paycheck for the week.

142
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:40,665
Rym: So games can be great if losing makes winning feel good and games can be great if losing itself gives you an experience that you don't normally as an adult who isn't afraid in haunted houses get.

143
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,578
Rym: So let's expand this idea of losing a little bit.

144
00:10:44,798 --> 00:10:46,485
Rym: Chrono Trigger I assume many of you have played.

145
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:51,044
Rym: it's one of the most iconic and beloved games arguably in video game history.

146
00:10:51,646 --> 00:10:56,685
Rym: It's very telling that no one has successfully made a sequel to this game spiritual or otherwise.

147
00:10:57,307 --> 00:10:59,775
Rym: Chrono Trigger is doing something a little bit different.

148
00:11:00,257 --> 00:11:03,608
Rym: this is exploring a narrative of victory a narrative winning.

149
00:11:03,689 --> 00:11:04,953
Rym: it's the same basic game.

150
00:11:05,274 --> 00:11:09,028
Rym: if I lose against some random encounter along the way the game just ends.

151
00:11:09,128 --> 00:11:10,252
Rym: it's just Mario dying.

152
00:11:10,312 --> 00:11:13,624
Rym: losing is just there because it has to present the challenge.

153
00:11:13,664 --> 00:11:15,772
Rym: otherwise it's not a game it's a movie.

154
00:11:16,254 --> 00:11:18,423
Rym: but if I do certain things the end is different.

155
00:11:18,463 --> 00:11:20,553
Rym: maybe Sinistar comes along with me on my journey.

156
00:11:20,975 --> 00:11:21,779
Rym: I get different endings.

157
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:27,517
Rym: I'm exploring this narrative of victory but it doesn't do anything with the narrative of failure.

158
00:11:28,119 --> 00:11:38,513
Rym: Failing in Chrono Trigger doesn't do anything other than prevent me from seeing an ending forces me to continue to go back to that save point with a few very interesting exceptions.

159
00:11:39,897 --> 00:11:41,222
Rym: it explores this a little bit.

160
00:11:41,744 --> 00:11:44,958
Rym: for those of you who played this game I apologize this is too soon or spoilers.

161
00:11:45,199 --> 00:11:58,167
Rym: there's one moment or one of the characters her mother's crippled in the game and you have an opportunity just once to prevent that in the past and if you do that you see her walking around and happy and leading a very different life in the future.

162
00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:02,166
Rym: if you fail at that she's still sitting in her chair sad and basically alone.

163
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,195
Rym: it doesn't affect the game very much.

164
00:12:04,255 --> 00:12:05,380
Rym: it's this tiny little thing.

165
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:16,755
Rym: but this is the first step in a game that primarily is focused on a winning narrative where they give you a losing narrative that isn't a dead end a losing narrative that changes something.

166
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:20,142
Rym: so then there are games like Shadowgate.

167
00:12:20,964 --> 00:12:32,288
Rym: Shadowgate is a game where you encounter a wraith you fucking hate into this wraith death go down a hole death bellowing like a fool.

168
00:12:32,328 --> 00:12:34,832
Rym: you leap off the bridge and into the blades death.

169
00:12:34,852 --> 00:12:37,295
Rym: you finally set your hair on fire.

170
00:12:37,315 --> 00:12:52,220
Rym: you can't even scream because you no longer have a throat let alone a larynx.

171
00:12:53,404 --> 00:12:57,474
Rym: I suspect Nintendo of America didn't read all the text in this wrong.

172
00:12:58,156 --> 00:13:03,106
Rym: so this game Shadowgate is famous for its death.

173
00:13:03,788 --> 00:13:11,179
Rym: but not just because there's a bunch of deaths because the deaths are all interesting and weird and the game is encouraging you to explore these deaths.

174
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,448
Rym: I mean look at this this right here this death.

175
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:22,596
Rym: this only occurs if you take use torch on self and you burn yourself badly but it doesn't kill you if you keep using the torch on yourself.

176
00:13:22,756 --> 00:13:24,782
Rym: eventually this happens and you die.

177
00:13:25,865 --> 00:13:27,028
Rym: so the game decided what?

178
00:13:27,249 --> 00:13:33,375
Rym: if this guy tries to set himself on fire let's warn him away a few times and then let's set him on fire.

179
00:13:34,077 --> 00:13:37,829
Rym: so what we're doing here is we're now exploring the narrative of failure.

180
00:13:37,869 --> 00:13:39,435
Rym: now we're getting into an interesting place.

181
00:13:39,776 --> 00:13:40,599
Rym: now this game.

182
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,385
Rym: it still has a narrative to the end.

183
00:13:42,727 --> 00:13:47,265
Rym: if playing the game to the end gives you an experience it gives you a victory.

184
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:51,662
Rym: it gives you that ending like other games do but every time Mario falls in the pit.

185
00:13:51,682 --> 00:13:52,485
Rym: it's a different thing.

186
00:13:52,746 --> 00:13:53,629
Rym: it's interesting.

187
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:58,146
Rym: we can explore it and a lot of games have done this even if you didn't realize it.

188
00:13:58,728 --> 00:13:59,310
Rym: out of this world.

189
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:03,448
Rym: relatively famous game on the Super Nintendo at least that's how most people played it.

190
00:14:03,689 --> 00:14:07,125
Rym: it was known by other names I believe another world outside of the United States.

191
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:13,394
Rym: there was a sitcom in the United States called another world at the time so they had to rename it and then there was also a sitcom called out of this world.

192
00:14:13,515 --> 00:14:23,828
Rym: so out of this world had elaborate and horrific animated deaths and many times when people played it you'd watch them seek out those deaths.

193
00:14:23,848 --> 00:14:31,515
Rym: you see something dangerous and at least once you're gonna go poke it and see what it does and you can see this resonates because the game like Dragon's Lair.

194
00:14:31,775 --> 00:14:39,694
Rym: this is a video every death scene in 720p and it's 100,000 views.

195
00:14:40,015 --> 00:14:47,200
Rym: so there's a hundred thousand people who wanted to watch in glorious half HD every elaborate death in this game.

196
00:14:47,641 --> 00:14:50,752
Rym: I don't want to say anything about those people but I think a lot of them might be in this room.

197
00:14:52,197 --> 00:14:54,243
Rym: here's another game you might have played.

198
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,229
Rym: these are games.

199
00:14:56,269 --> 00:14:57,615
Rym: don't let anyone tell you they're not.

200
00:14:57,896 --> 00:14:59,223
Rym: and how did you play these games?

201
00:14:59,584 --> 00:15:01,232
Rym: you know this is a choose your own adventure.

202
00:15:01,332 --> 00:15:08,718
Rym: if you've never encountered these this one this particular choose your own adventure is special because you can't win this one.

203
00:15:09,561 --> 00:15:11,508
Rym: there's a winning ending where you find paradise.

204
00:15:11,749 --> 00:15:13,495
Rym: there's literally no way to get to it unless you cheat.

205
00:15:15,542 --> 00:15:22,400
Rym: no page references the page that takes you to the good ending and the book is about finding paradise.

206
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:25,448
Rym: I don't know if that was intentional or not.

207
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:29,740
Rym: I'm gonna hope it was so in this game.

208
00:15:30,061 --> 00:15:30,483
Rym: many of you.

209
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:31,345
Rym: how did you play these?

210
00:15:31,386 --> 00:15:41,443
Rym: as a kid you get to a choice and it's like do you climb the rickety bridge past the snakes the snakes or do you go home and eat chocolate and you know that chocolates the right way to go?

211
00:15:41,905 --> 00:15:54,839
Rym: but you put your finger in that page and you flip over because these games also had pretty elaborately descriptive horrific death texts and for some whatever reason we like exploring those.

212
00:15:55,961 --> 00:15:56,944
Rym: so here's another game.

213
00:15:57,044 --> 00:16:00,212
Rym: don't sit your pants.

214
00:16:00,232 --> 00:16:03,705
Rym: you might not be able to read that subtitle a survival horror game.

215
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:11,330
Rym: this is a text adventure that you can all play online and it is literally just that it is a text adventure.

216
00:16:11,731 --> 00:16:14,936
Rym: can you not poop your pants now?

217
00:16:15,397 --> 00:16:17,320
Rym: you can pretty easily win this game.

218
00:16:17,741 --> 00:16:34,524
Rym: however when you win this game it gives you an achievement and then there's a bunch of blanked-out achievements and then you start exploring what happens if I do different things in this game.

219
00:16:35,105 --> 00:16:44,866
Rym: for example if I just type kill self I kill myself and then because I'm dead I shit my pants and then I lose.

220
00:16:46,248 --> 00:16:50,134
Rym: so if I take my pants off first I win.

221
00:16:50,715 --> 00:16:53,039
Rym: the game isn't don't die.

222
00:16:53,059 --> 00:16:59,047
Rym: so what about the Stanley Farrell?

223
00:17:00,489 --> 00:17:03,781
Rym: this game arguably doesn't have winning or losing.

224
00:17:03,942 --> 00:17:05,809
Rym: we're not exploring a narrative of failure.

225
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:07,395
Rym: we're not exploring a narrative of success.

226
00:17:07,675 --> 00:17:09,161
Rym: we're just exploring.

227
00:17:09,642 --> 00:17:12,853
Rym: no ending is the right ending of many of them say they are.

228
00:17:14,057 --> 00:17:15,582
Rym: no ending is the bad ending.

229
00:17:15,883 --> 00:17:26,499
Rym: even if you play the longest possible path through the game you find the secret at the end for Mario the narrative of this game.

230
00:17:26,539 --> 00:17:28,904
Rym: the game is just a game of exploring narrative.

231
00:17:29,085 --> 00:17:30,050
Rym: there's no challenge.

232
00:17:30,371 --> 00:17:32,781
Rym: you can die in this game but it doesn't really mean anything.

233
00:17:32,841 --> 00:17:34,045
Rym: dying is just a choice.

234
00:17:34,827 --> 00:17:36,953
Rym: so we still call this a game.

235
00:17:37,395 --> 00:17:38,779
Rym: what about Ghost Dad Detective?

236
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,511
Rym: you might have played this so Murdered Soul Suspect.

237
00:17:42,612 --> 00:17:44,639
Rym: I'm an enforcer at PAX East and I was.

238
00:17:44,719 --> 00:17:55,045
Rym: I was doing like the live streaming stuff for the Albatross theater and Squeenix was talking about this game and they did a great panel about this game and then they opened the room up to questions and one dude I don't know who he was.

239
00:17:55,065 --> 00:17:56,270
Rym: I tried to find him but he disappeared.

240
00:17:56,551 --> 00:18:05,420
Rym: my hero and he walks up and the first question was so can you lose this game like can you not figure out who murdered you?

241
00:18:05,861 --> 00:18:07,345
Rym: or is this basically just a movie?

242
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:17,512
Rym: and they really really tried to not say yeah this game is just a movie but they basically admitted that the game is just a movie.

243
00:18:19,237 --> 00:18:21,704
Rym: so now we're getting into something really interesting Gone Home.

244
00:18:22,566 --> 00:18:25,815
Rym: Gone Home is a beautiful brilliant game.

245
00:18:26,176 --> 00:18:34,238
Rym: however independently of Gone Home valve steam added community tags you can tag a game with whatever you want.

246
00:18:34,639 --> 00:18:36,624
Rym: I would tag games as good or bad.

247
00:18:36,905 --> 00:18:39,552
Rym: some people would tag games as not a game.

248
00:18:41,156 --> 00:18:43,702
Rym: in fact this games tags at that time word not a game.

249
00:18:44,343 --> 00:18:49,130
Rym: bad walking simulator and tumblr.

250
00:18:52,155 --> 00:18:54,359
Rym: now I'm gonna say I'm gonna direct here.

251
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,646
Rym: people who say that this is not a game are assholes.

252
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:01,716
Rym: but why did so many games get tagged?

253
00:19:01,836 --> 00:19:02,538
Rym: not a game?

254
00:19:03,219 --> 00:19:05,568
Rym: well because we keep using that word game.

255
00:19:06,251 --> 00:19:09,504
Rym: now those of you who were at my other lecture yesterday a little bit of this is cup ground.

256
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:11,673
Rym: we're gonna cover again we're gonna cook it slightly.

257
00:19:11,713 --> 00:19:20,354
Rym: so so game designers game people use one of these three definitions a series an interactive amusement series of interesting and or meaningful decisions a competitive test of skill.

258
00:19:20,997 --> 00:19:24,894
Rym: people who say something's not a game are always thinking about games as number three.

259
00:19:25,195 --> 00:19:29,893
Rym: they think of games as challenges and games that are not a challenge are not games to them.

260
00:19:30,214 --> 00:19:31,519
Rym: they call themselves gamers.

261
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,874
Rym: they get mad when other people who play other kinds of games call themselves gamers.

262
00:19:35,135 --> 00:19:35,919
Rym: they're assholes.

263
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,205
Rym: but you can at least see.

264
00:19:38,225 --> 00:19:50,362
Rym: that's why in fact I wish they hadn't gotten rid of that not a game tag because the not a game tag was a way to find some of the best games on steam so an interactive amusement.

265
00:19:50,442 --> 00:19:59,008
Rym: it's very telling that the organization that globally generally administers video games is not the video game Association.

266
00:19:59,369 --> 00:20:02,117
Rym: it's the entertainment software Association.

267
00:20:02,819 --> 00:20:07,138
Rym: we're not talking about games that are ortho games or ideal games or strategy games or competitive games.

268
00:20:07,399 --> 00:20:11,737
Rym: we're talking about entertainment software everything on a computer all these things.

269
00:20:11,937 --> 00:20:17,622
Rym: it's not a movie because while I can pause a movie if you're gonna argue that that's interaction you're an insufferable penance.

270
00:20:19,507 --> 00:20:21,212
Rym: but it's not a movie.

271
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:23,057
Rym: but yet it might be mostly a movie.

272
00:20:23,077 --> 00:20:26,891
Rym: Ghost Dad Detective is mostly a movie but I'm interacting with it.

273
00:20:26,971 --> 00:20:27,855
Rym: it's still a game.

274
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:28,879
Rym: I'm not gonna say it's not a game.

275
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:29,642
Rym: so there's always.

276
00:20:29,682 --> 00:20:32,675
Rym: bear in mind that video games are not just games.

277
00:20:32,695 --> 00:20:41,988
Rym: they're entertainment software things that are entertainment software might not look like what you think of as a game but there's still a game because game is a super generic word.

278
00:20:43,131 --> 00:20:47,003
Rym: so there's another term ortho game which describes that game type number three.

279
00:20:47,425 --> 00:21:00,490
Rym: this is a word I stole a page from Richard Garfield because he took a saw a prefix ortho and added it to game to make his competitive test of skill definition IDEO is a prefix that means like personal or unique.

280
00:21:01,073 --> 00:21:15,323
Rym: so in this case an audio game is a game that presents a series of interesting player decisions that produces a personal outcome the idea that these are games where I as the player are making choice and making choices and those choices lead to a conclusion.

281
00:21:15,363 --> 00:21:17,369
Rym: and that path was personal to me.

282
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:21,062
Rym: other people might follow the same path but I follow that path.

283
00:21:21,424 --> 00:21:22,489
Rym: I had an experience.

284
00:21:22,529 --> 00:21:24,759
Rym: if I play it again I might have a different experience.

285
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:27,291
Rym: if someone else plays it they might have a different experience.

286
00:21:27,572 --> 00:21:32,860
Rym: so when one of those assholes says that something's not a game throw it right back in their face and say what do you mean by game?

287
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,086
Rym: are you talking about ortho games or IDEO games?

288
00:21:35,687 --> 00:21:36,971
Rym: and that'll usually shut them up.

289
00:21:37,693 --> 00:21:50,355
Rym: so let's go in a totally different direction poor Luigi let's talk about ortho games.

290
00:21:50,756 --> 00:21:55,186
Rym: so candy land candy land as we talked about yesterday.

291
00:21:55,206 --> 00:21:59,725
Rym: I almost call this a pseudo game because it's not a game in the sense that I mean it's interactive.

292
00:21:59,966 --> 00:22:03,623
Rym: it's interactive amusement but players have no input in this game whatsoever.

293
00:22:04,887 --> 00:22:17,031
Rym: the definition of all the games are talking about at this point now are ortho games Richard Garfield's definition of games in this context competitions trying to win the games that the grognard gamers are yelling you about not a game think of as games.

294
00:22:17,834 --> 00:22:20,523
Rym: so matchmaking is one interesting area.

295
00:22:20,543 --> 00:22:21,366
Rym: we're losing matters.

296
00:22:21,567 --> 00:22:28,411
Rym: Left 4 Dead Left 4 Dead 2 and many games where there are teams and you can play the games online have this problem.

297
00:22:28,753 --> 00:22:29,957
Rym: it's a problem around losing.

298
00:22:30,459 --> 00:22:35,683
Rym: if I'm on a team with three other people and we're doing pretty well we're gonna keep playing together we're having fun.

299
00:22:35,743 --> 00:22:39,457
Rym: we've formed a group and in fact most likely I joined with a friend.

300
00:22:39,798 --> 00:22:43,487
Rym: so it's me and a friend and two randos and eventually we form a team.

301
00:22:43,507 --> 00:22:44,008
Rym: that's pretty good.

302
00:22:44,028 --> 00:22:44,530
Rym: we're having fun.

303
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,653
Rym: we're playing all day.

304
00:22:46,154 --> 00:22:52,813
Rym: meanwhile Joey Jojo he joins a random team and it's gonna put him in a team that's not full.

305
00:22:54,016 --> 00:22:55,279
Rym: so people are rage quitting.

306
00:22:56,142 --> 00:22:58,187
Rym: people are rage quitting constantly in these games.

307
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:07,699
Rym: the teams that have a spot more often than not are going to be teams that have been losing up to this point that people have been rage quitting from.

308
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:19,363
Rym: so as a result if you join a game through the matchmaking system you're most likely going to be put on a terrible team that's losing and then you're going to rage quit perpetuating the cycle forever.

309
00:23:21,048 --> 00:23:23,959
Rym: so you can see how just that feeling of losing.

310
00:23:24,441 --> 00:23:29,584
Rym: you might feel like the game is way hard or that everyone you play a game with is terrible and that's why you're always losing.

311
00:23:29,946 --> 00:23:31,674
Rym: but sometimes it's because of a matter factor.

312
00:23:31,895 --> 00:23:34,869
Rym: the matchmaking system is making the game feel that way.

313
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:38,180
Rym: the matchmaking system has this sort of adverse selection.

314
00:23:39,826 --> 00:23:41,170
Rym: so what about skill disparities?

315
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,474
Rym: what about in one-on-one games?

316
00:23:43,497 --> 00:23:54,876
Rym: it is not fun to play against people who are good at Dota 2. you are not good at Dota 2. it is not fun to play Street Fighter against someone who's played even one hour longer than you've played.

317
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,565
Rym: some games handle this very well.

318
00:23:57,806 --> 00:23:59,633
Rym: some games handle this very poorly.

319
00:24:00,015 --> 00:24:15,912
Rym: a game that handles it probably the best of any game I've ever seen is Dance Dance Revolution because Dance Dance Revolution has three or four depending on how old you are difficulty level or five depending on how really old you are difficulty levels and if you play multiplayer it's competitive.

320
00:24:15,953 --> 00:24:26,712
Rym: you're both getting a score but I can have the easy arrows dancing next to the person who had the difficult arrows and while our scores may be way different score is a tiny little number on the screen.

321
00:24:27,093 --> 00:24:37,812
Rym: the big result at the end is your grade so I can get an A playing the super hard level and the beginner next to me can get a playing the super easy level but we're both dancing to the same song.

322
00:24:38,193 --> 00:24:46,902
Rym: so it still lets the skilled players have their really horrible competition but it doesn't make the newbie players feel shitty about playing next to those people.

323
00:24:47,745 --> 00:24:54,268
Rym: meanwhile other games like for example tennis the sport of tennis or ping pong is a great example.

324
00:24:54,309 --> 00:24:57,178
Rym: there's a reason why ping pong will never be the omega-thon finale.

325
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:05,300
Rym: if one person is even reasonably skilled at ping pong and the other person's never played it the omega-thon is over in 30 seconds.

326
00:25:08,108 --> 00:25:09,050
Rym: so grief.

327
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:20,271
Rym: so I had a joke.

328
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:28,638
Rym: I'll just go because this this is my flavor now.

329
00:25:28,678 --> 00:25:29,799
Rym: this did backfire on me.

330
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:39,145
Rym: once I was telling Counter Strike and we won the last it was basically we were down and we caught up and it was then 10. we had nine.

331
00:25:39,165 --> 00:25:40,148
Rym: we were counter-terrorists.

332
00:25:40,589 --> 00:25:41,693
Rym: we won the match.

333
00:25:42,135 --> 00:25:46,790
Rym: all we had to do was defuse the bomb and that would have been a draw as opposed to also losing.

334
00:25:47,633 --> 00:26:10,056
Rym: so I thought it'd be really funny if I let my guys start defusing the bomb and then I knifed him to death and then I went to defuse the bomb and then I sneezed and knocked my mouse off the computer and by the time I got my wits back together it was too late I quit before they kicked me off the server.

335
00:26:10,376 --> 00:26:12,340
Rym: so what is griefing?

336
00:26:12,961 --> 00:26:15,448
Rym: griefing is not trolling.

337
00:26:15,989 --> 00:26:18,235
Rym: trolling and griefing are two different things.

338
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:29,054
Rym: trolling is trying to get a rise out of someone in the meta context of the game yelling things in the Xbox live chat typing your ridiculous racist nonsense whatever is you kids do.

339
00:26:29,455 --> 00:26:31,543
Rym: all those things are trying to get a rise out of people.

340
00:26:32,165 --> 00:26:35,416
Rym: but griefing is playing with alternate utility.

341
00:26:35,837 --> 00:26:36,238
Rym: utility.

342
00:26:36,258 --> 00:26:38,991
Rym: is that game theory term for what you're trying to get out of a game now?

343
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:41,984
Rym: if I'm playing Counter Strike I'm usually trying to win.

344
00:26:42,164 --> 00:26:43,187
Rym: that is my utility.

345
00:26:43,529 --> 00:26:49,608
Rym: but at that time when I was griefing when I was that guy and I did that my primary utility was not winning.

346
00:26:49,648 --> 00:26:51,293
Rym: my primary utility was getting a laugh.

347
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:56,590
Rym: griefing doesn't necessarily mean that you are blocking your team.

348
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:59,680
Rym: griefing just means that I am playing for utility.

349
00:27:00,101 --> 00:27:02,289
Rym: that's different from what everyone else is playing for.

350
00:27:03,293 --> 00:27:06,765
Rym: griefing usually occurs when one person is not having fun.

351
00:27:07,528 --> 00:27:16,922
Rym: if I'm playing Counter Strike and I'm losing and I'm not having fun and I can't have fun by playing the game itself I might have a lot more fun team flashing and just being a dick.

352
00:27:17,986 --> 00:27:18,769
Rym: and now I'm winning.

353
00:27:18,789 --> 00:27:22,683
Rym: I'm winning and the other team's winning everybody's winning except the rest of my team.

354
00:27:26,051 --> 00:27:32,932
Rym: so the point of this is that if someone is griefing in a game that you've designed for example you need to think long and hard about why.

355
00:27:33,333 --> 00:27:34,878
Rym: why is that person bored?

356
00:27:35,299 --> 00:27:38,972
Rym: why does this game allow someone who is losing to grief?

357
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:41,822
Rym: why does this game even give them that affordance?

358
00:27:41,922 --> 00:27:44,270
Rym: affordances are like a UX UI term.

359
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:50,831
Rym: affordances are the things that you are afforded the actions you are allowed to have based on your interface.

360
00:27:51,313 --> 00:27:53,240
Rym: so this table it has some affordances.

361
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,790
Rym: I can flip it over table lets me do that.

362
00:27:56,031 --> 00:27:57,678
Rym: however if they chain it down then I can't.

363
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:58,280
Rym: I'm no longer.

364
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:58,903
Rym: that affordance.

365
00:27:59,546 --> 00:28:01,092
Rym: a bus shelter that has a glass window.

366
00:28:01,414 --> 00:28:09,586
Rym: and affordance of that glass window is that I could break it if I'm a vandal but I can't really write it but if it's wooden I can't easily break it but now I can write on it.

367
00:28:10,127 --> 00:28:27,783
Rym: so games that have a lot of griefing in them either are not serving the interests of the utility of the majority of players who are playing are poorly designed in some fashion or just have a really bad community around people who play the game not for purposes of the game itself.

368
00:28:28,184 --> 00:28:32,554
Rym: the game's utility structure is jank no ending.

369
00:28:33,496 --> 00:28:36,243
Rym: losing only happens when a game ends.

370
00:28:36,725 --> 00:28:38,209
Rym: you've played Monopoly.

371
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:45,230
Rym: you lost Monopoly three hours ago but there's two people going around in circles until someone goes home or flips the table over.

372
00:28:46,895 --> 00:28:55,880
Rym: so the reason games like that never end is partly because if I know I've lost I could just say let's just stop you win.

373
00:28:56,441 --> 00:28:59,491
Rym: however I don't say that because I've already lost.

374
00:29:00,133 --> 00:29:00,956
Rym: I just keep playing.

375
00:29:01,558 --> 00:29:06,752
Rym: maybe the other person's gonna give up maybe they're gonna go home and then I win which is just.

376
00:29:06,772 --> 00:29:19,449
Rym: a lot of games have this problem where the game is over but the game does not give the winner a way to end the game or it does not give the loser a way to end the game.

377
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:27,397
Rym: games need to end about at the point where the majority of the players have figured out that the game has actually ended and is over.

378
00:29:27,819 --> 00:29:31,132
Rym: otherwise this is one of the prime reasons griefing starts occurring.

379
00:29:31,393 --> 00:29:44,397
Rym: this is where your friend who already lost settlers starts making all these ridiculous trades with that girl he likes because he lost anyway and the games going on forever and he just wants it to end catching up now.

380
00:29:44,959 --> 00:29:49,996
Rym: in the previous lecture I talked about how there's no such thing as catching up in games there.

381
00:29:50,116 --> 00:29:51,782
Rym: that literally does not exist.

382
00:29:52,044 --> 00:29:54,574
Rym: if you could have caught up you were never behind.

383
00:29:54,634 --> 00:29:57,062
Rym: you just didn't understand the game sufficiently.

384
00:29:57,945 --> 00:30:05,650
Rym: so it even though it's illusory there's no possible way to catch up if you are behind because you weren't actually that far behind.

385
00:30:06,594 --> 00:30:08,522
Rym: games still have the appearances of catching up.

386
00:30:08,823 --> 00:30:10,710
Rym: power grid initial D all these games.

387
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:11,593
Rym: there's rubber bands.

388
00:30:11,834 --> 00:30:13,340
Rym: they do things to take.

389
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:19,446
Rym: a player who feels like they're very far behind and at least tricks them into thinking that they still have a chance of winning.

390
00:30:19,466 --> 00:30:24,086
Rym: or if they think that they're far behind gives them this hope that maybe they'll catch up maybe they'll get the blue shell.

391
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:37,013
Rym: it's actually very good game design to obscure the mechanics to obscure the heuristics just enough so that players who aren't super pro and have lost a long time ago don't realize they've lost yet.

392
00:30:37,414 --> 00:30:39,863
Rym: that way they'll keep playing they'll keep enjoying the game.

393
00:30:41,709 --> 00:30:43,434
Rym: there are two very interesting ways to do this.

394
00:30:43,535 --> 00:30:45,180
Rym: and these two railroad games.

395
00:30:45,401 --> 00:30:49,097
Rym: they're not crayon railroad games they're more like ticket to ride style railroad games.

396
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:52,712
Rym: these are games railroad tycoon age of steam basically the same.

397
00:30:52,872 --> 00:30:56,727
Rym: make some trains move cubes around get victory points in age of steam.

398
00:30:57,169 --> 00:30:57,751
Rym: you fuck up.

399
00:30:58,193 --> 00:31:02,249
Rym: if you're doing too badly if you're mathematically eliminated from winning the game kicks you out.

400
00:31:03,252 --> 00:31:04,758
Rym: you're done go leave the table.

401
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:05,821
Rym: come back in a couple hours.

402
00:31:06,242 --> 00:31:07,365
Rym: so you're not stuck there.

403
00:31:08,247 --> 00:31:09,710
Rym: if I'm stuck there I'll grief.

404
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:14,962
Rym: if I can go away I'll go there till the end.

405
00:31:15,103 --> 00:31:22,989
Rym: but railroad tycoon has a huge board and a million pieces and you're physically moving all these cubes and trains and things around.

406
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:24,555
Rym: so it's really fun.

407
00:31:24,595 --> 00:31:25,780
Rym: it's like sim train.

408
00:31:26,402 --> 00:31:42,422
Rym: so as a result and I've seen this experience people who have lost railroad tycoon even if they realize it are more than happy to play to the end of the game because one the game makes them feel like they could catch up and two it's pretty fun to keep trying to maximize your score even if you can't win in the end.

409
00:31:44,126 --> 00:31:51,607
Rym: small world very popular game is actually a reskin and a slight update to an older game by the same person called Vinci.

410
00:31:52,852 --> 00:31:54,779
Rym: there are subtle differences between the two.

411
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:58,697
Rym: as an aside the problem is if you ever played one of these you can never play the other one.

412
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,687
Rym: you will mess up really subtle rules.

413
00:32:02,268 --> 00:32:09,951
Rym: but Vinci's big difference in these purposes is that victory points are open and public the entire game.

414
00:32:09,991 --> 00:32:15,587
Rym: there's a score track around the board and the game ends once one player has passed a certain number of points.

415
00:32:16,891 --> 00:32:27,483
Rym: so the game becomes very skill based around the idea of managing the ebb and flow of the game of figuring out do I want to push it past 150 right now?

416
00:32:27,884 --> 00:32:31,960
Rym: but what if the player after me then surges way past me and I don't get another turn?

417
00:32:32,441 --> 00:32:39,924
Rym: the game however is not fun for very bad players because they can see the entire game how far behind they actually are.

418
00:32:40,365 --> 00:32:43,998
Rym: small world is mostly the same game accepted as a set.

419
00:32:44,018 --> 00:32:46,907
Rym: number of turns and victory points are secret.

420
00:32:47,649 --> 00:32:48,853
Rym: they're not really secret.

421
00:32:49,314 --> 00:32:52,748
Rym: if you want to win that game you should be counting the victory points the whole time.

422
00:32:52,788 --> 00:33:01,043
Rym: you can know how many victory points everyone has it's public information but once you once that information is revealed it's that hidden unless you remembered it.

423
00:33:01,384 --> 00:33:05,481
Rym: so people keep playing small world thinking they're way more ahead than they are.

424
00:33:05,802 --> 00:33:11,262
Rym: as a result the losers are more than happy to keep playing until the end usually because skeleton whatevers are super fun.

425
00:33:13,407 --> 00:33:13,948
Rym: excitement.

426
00:33:14,529 --> 00:33:19,741
Rym: you'll notice that sports and popular eSports they're the same thing.

427
00:33:20,062 --> 00:33:34,461
Rym: but games that are popular among the mass public that are long-standing that have long histories tend to have this idea that the game ends the exact second the winner and loser are determined.

428
00:33:36,046 --> 00:33:37,511
Rym: neither player has won the game.

429
00:33:37,551 --> 00:33:45,320
Rym: yet either of these players at least theoretically has an equal chance of winning the game because it's just points I could just keep scoring points.

430
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:47,107
Rym: it's just my execution it's just my skill.

431
00:33:47,589 --> 00:33:59,362
Rym: so games like this are the games that are used in tournaments games where any player no matter what could catch up could win the game until the moment the game is over.

432
00:34:01,228 --> 00:34:12,244
Rym: as a result losing a game like this can be really fun because if you're losing a game like this it's still exciting you're still learning you're still playing you're not eliminated and forced to go through the motions anymore.

433
00:34:14,027 --> 00:34:16,293
Rym: ego shields are very important.

434
00:34:16,893 --> 00:34:21,629
Rym: so I lose games even though I just did a lecture on how to win games.

435
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:22,534
Rym: but I lose games.

436
00:34:22,614 --> 00:34:24,681
Rym: everybody loses games because it's random bullshit.

437
00:34:24,722 --> 00:34:26,085
Rym: every game I lost is random bullshit.

438
00:34:26,126 --> 00:34:27,047
Rym: every game I win is 100% skill.

439
00:34:27,069 --> 00:34:34,954
Rym: but it is very important especially for novice gamers to give them an ego shield.

440
00:34:35,396 --> 00:34:42,458
Rym: even though they made terrible decisions in Sellers of Catan the entire time they made poor trades they bought.

441
00:34:42,498 --> 00:34:46,757
Rym: they put their settlement on the edge of the desert because they didn't understand the rules whatever.

442
00:34:46,797 --> 00:34:52,277
Rym: that is in the very least because the dice are random because there's some fudge factor.

443
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:53,984
Rym: there's actually a lot of fudge factor in that game.

444
00:34:55,268 --> 00:34:57,796
Rym: they at least have a crutch to fall back on of.

445
00:34:58,097 --> 00:35:01,288
Rym: yeah I didn't do that well but the dice screwed me in the end.

446
00:35:02,412 --> 00:35:14,532
Rym: it's also important for very skilled players because games that are pure pure tests of skill where there is no randomness where is literally just your decisions or your executions versus your opponents.

447
00:35:14,894 --> 00:35:22,379
Rym: if I lose a game like that against someone they are objectively better than me at that and there's nothing I can say around that.

448
00:35:22,821 --> 00:35:27,453
Rym: now really competitive people are totally okay with that normal people not so much.

449
00:35:27,473 --> 00:35:31,406
Rym: the limits of skill are also very important.

450
00:35:31,507 --> 00:35:35,527
Rym: a lot of people when they start getting good at games expect that they'll start winning games a lot more often.

451
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:36,090
Rym: that is true.

452
00:35:36,492 --> 00:35:47,148
Rym: but for example if you play poker the percentage that you'll win in terms of hands over everybody else even if you're a very skilled poker player is in the single digits.

453
00:35:47,609 --> 00:35:52,848
Rym: being very good at poker gives you a relatively tiny edge among other pretty good players.

454
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:53,471
Rym: you'll crush.

455
00:35:53,491 --> 00:35:56,061
Rym: people have no idea but you're gonna lose a lot of hands.

456
00:35:56,101 --> 00:35:59,512
Rym: if you play poker you're gonna fold most of the time.

457
00:36:00,094 --> 00:36:10,591
Rym: so when you lose games and when you design a game you need to really pay attention to what is that percentage because that determines who's going to play your game what the experience of losing is like.

458
00:36:11,133 --> 00:36:16,088
Rym: an example of this forget poker there's a game called pendant a pendant.

459
00:36:16,108 --> 00:36:17,993
Rym: a is panda Texas hold.

460
00:36:18,975 --> 00:36:21,422
Rym: it has a panda deck it has panda stuff.

461
00:36:22,004 --> 00:36:24,293
Rym: it's basically Texas hold them but with a few different rules.

462
00:36:24,694 --> 00:36:28,608
Rym: but what it does is it condenses and distills the experience of poker.

463
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:40,849
Rym: so if you're good at those skills the bluffing part the bidding part all the fun parts of poker you'll win 20 30 40 percent more often as opposed to point one point two point three percent more often.

464
00:36:41,431 --> 00:36:51,744
Rym: but the game's also themed and set such that if you're losing and you're folding all the time the game either ends really quickly so you don't feel bad about it or the game is just super fun to play the whole time.

465
00:36:54,367 --> 00:36:58,118
Rym: so heuristics and feedback this is a very important thing.

466
00:36:58,158 --> 00:36:59,022
Rym: I want to show you a clip.

467
00:36:59,283 --> 00:37:03,621
Rym: I'm gonna bring protocol here and you're actually going to see my desktop for a second very unprofessional.

468
00:37:04,204 --> 00:37:10,537
Rym: so this is from a Japanese animation called fist of the North Star also known as hookah.

469
00:37:10,577 --> 00:37:12,500
Rym: okay I'm gonna show this to you.

470
00:37:19,451 --> 00:37:20,232
Rym: that's the good.

471
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:31,940
Rym: I'll say one more clip and this will tell you if you would enjoy.

472
00:39:53,313 --> 00:40:01,845
Rym: so that is fist of the North Star and I promise it's relevant to what we're talking about.

473
00:40:02,727 --> 00:40:07,238
Rym: because Cobra Commander guy in the second bit when did he lose that fight?

474
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:14,927
Rym: he lost the fight when the elbow came up because Kenshiro's power his catchphrase in that whole show is "Omae wa mo shindeiru".

475
00:40:15,609 --> 00:40:16,853
Rym: you are already dead.

476
00:40:17,495 --> 00:40:23,211
Rym: he pokes people in there whatever chakra stuff and that does things to the body and then they explode.

477
00:40:24,796 --> 00:40:27,324
Rym: so we did that to the dude with his elbow way early.

478
00:40:27,865 --> 00:40:33,101
Rym: so the guy lost the fight long before he even realized he had no idea that he was dead.

479
00:40:34,444 --> 00:40:38,614
Rym: Dota 2 League of Legends Heroes of New Earth.

480
00:40:39,436 --> 00:40:41,621
Rym: they have a problem with heuristics and feedback.

481
00:40:42,243 --> 00:40:48,136
Rym: they do not tell players who are learning and losing when how and why they lost.

482
00:40:49,219 --> 00:40:52,708
Rym: if you lose a game of Dota 2 you lose here.

483
00:40:53,249 --> 00:40:57,280
Rym: you made a mistake here and here the game never tells you that.

484
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,503
Rym: that was when you made a mistake.

485
00:40:58,743 --> 00:41:05,922
Rym: your teammates might tell you usually very angrily but the game does not tell you.

486
00:41:05,962 --> 00:41:07,487
Rym: the game does not give you feedback.

487
00:41:07,848 --> 00:41:17,384
Rym: games that don't tell players how and why they're losing that don't give you feedback when you're making poor decisions or at least soon after you make the poor decisions.

488
00:41:17,846 --> 00:41:20,335
Rym: they can't actually teach you how to play themselves.

489
00:41:20,576 --> 00:41:22,323
Rym: you can only learn them in the meta.

490
00:41:22,343 --> 00:41:28,048
Rym: you can learn them from instruction but you can't actually learn them by doing them so as a result.

491
00:41:28,088 --> 00:41:38,051
Rym: that's why a lot of people when they start to play those really high skill cap games counter-strike is another example people think that there's a big skill component of sneaking around and looking in the window and flank left.

492
00:41:38,071 --> 00:41:38,493
Rym: Franklin.

493
00:41:38,533 --> 00:41:42,449
Rym: now click on the guy's head click on his head faster than everybody else.

494
00:41:42,931 --> 00:41:43,855
Rym: you've mastered that skill.

495
00:41:43,895 --> 00:41:48,251
Rym: you've mastered counter-strike but the game doesn't tell you that you have to figure that out.

496
00:41:48,813 --> 00:42:03,194
Rym: so people who start to play games like this either join the community get yelled at learn outside of the game and then eventually get good or they quit because that game is bullshit and that game sucks.

497
00:42:04,216 --> 00:42:11,103
Rym: if a game is going to make you lose and losing is your fault it needs to tell you that it's your fault or at least make you think it's your fault.

498
00:42:11,525 --> 00:42:20,035
Rym: that is why Silver Surfer is not fun when you're losing and Super Meat Boy is when you die in Super Meat Boy you know you messed up.

499
00:42:20,095 --> 00:42:22,022
Rym: the game is like yo bro you messed up right there.

500
00:42:22,383 --> 00:42:22,945
Rym: you feel it.

501
00:42:22,965 --> 00:42:23,788
Rym: you know it's your fault.

502
00:42:23,808 --> 00:42:24,732
Rym: you blame yourself.

503
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:30,698
Rym: when Silver Surfer dies you blame the game you blame the programmer you blame the controller because that game is bullshit.

504
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,024
Rym: it feels random.

505
00:42:32,305 --> 00:42:35,298
Rym: you don't feel like that thing touched the Silver Surfer it totally.

506
00:42:35,318 --> 00:42:39,433
Rym: that pixel wasn't even close to me and Super Meat Boy that's pixel perfect.

507
00:42:39,694 --> 00:42:42,904
Rym: the one pixel of that razor blade touches you and you're dead.

508
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:46,456
Rym: so we're gonna go in a completely different direction.

509
00:42:46,496 --> 00:42:48,563
Rym: now that is my gaming group.

510
00:42:50,009 --> 00:42:50,792
Rym: I don't think they realize.

511
00:42:50,832 --> 00:42:58,456
Rym: I travel around the world showing this awful picture of them in the pajamas and we're playing Dungeons & Dragons.

512
00:42:58,496 --> 00:43:02,250
Rym: at that point though we later moved on to Burning Wheel and tabletop RPGs.

513
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:06,969
Rym: winning and losing are very interesting thing here and I want to use a game called the Burning Wheel.

514
00:43:06,989 --> 00:43:09,519
Rym: have any of you played Burning Wheel the role-playing game?

515
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:16,782
Rym: so if this seems interesting I recommend you grab one of these flyers at the end because last PAX Australia.

516
00:43:17,063 --> 00:43:22,784
Rym: we did a panel called Beyond Dungeons & Dragons and we talked at length about this game and other similar games.

517
00:43:23,285 --> 00:43:30,308
Rym: so in Burning Wheel if my character wants to get better at sword fighting I test my sword fighting skill.

518
00:43:30,328 --> 00:43:32,639
Rym: whenever I'm using sword fighting I test my climbing skill.

519
00:43:32,659 --> 00:43:35,129
Rym: when I want to climb something I test my lockpicking skill.

520
00:43:36,434 --> 00:43:38,904
Rym: every time I roll the dice I'm either gonna succeed or fail.

521
00:43:39,285 --> 00:43:42,817
Rym: success has huge consequences and failure has huge consequences.

522
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:52,444
Rym: in order to level up my sword skill I must succeed a certain number of times and I effectively must also fail a certain number of times.

523
00:43:53,427 --> 00:44:00,183
Rym: trying to use a skill succeeding and failing at it is the only way to advance my skills.

524
00:44:00,685 --> 00:44:04,355
Rym: so I must lose sword fights that cripple my character.

525
00:44:04,776 --> 00:44:07,425
Rym: I must lose debates that get him thrown in jail.

526
00:44:07,646 --> 00:44:13,887
Rym: in jail I must try to climb mountains that are likely to kill my character because that is the only way to advance.

527
00:44:14,489 --> 00:44:32,703
Rym: so as a result characters follow more realistic narrative driven arcs because characters will strive for something succeed sometimes fail be changed and disfigured and scarred in ways we never expected and then eventually that is how they become the swordsman.

528
00:44:32,804 --> 00:44:34,991
Rym: that's how they become the legend or they die.

529
00:44:37,017 --> 00:44:40,247
Rym: Burning Wheel also has a system of beliefs and instincts.

530
00:44:40,789 --> 00:44:42,795
Rym: beliefs you write them on your character sheet.

531
00:44:43,056 --> 00:44:45,924
Rym: you have a belief I will avenge my father's death.

532
00:44:46,686 --> 00:44:47,969
Rym: I will kill that motherfucker.

533
00:44:48,892 --> 00:44:51,559
Rym: I will have traits like Harry.

534
00:44:51,579 --> 00:44:57,626
Rym: you can write Harry and my uncle is Calvin Blackstaff and all that stuff you write on all your D&D character sheets doesn't mean anything.

535
00:44:58,067 --> 00:45:02,843
Rym: spend points at character creation and your character has the trait Harry.

536
00:45:03,384 --> 00:45:09,056
Rym: that means he's Harry and it matters the game master will use that.

537
00:45:10,739 --> 00:45:14,570
Rym: negative traits cause just as much as positive traits.

538
00:45:15,392 --> 00:45:21,491
Rym: traits that make your character suck cost more sometimes than traits that make him or her awesome.

539
00:45:22,395 --> 00:45:23,278
Rym: and you have instincts.

540
00:45:23,659 --> 00:45:31,043
Rym: I might have an instinct like when inch when I see an enemy draw my sword or never leave anyone behind or never trust an elf.

541
00:45:33,068 --> 00:45:34,672
Rym: so say that instinct could get me in trouble.

542
00:45:35,374 --> 00:45:43,784
Rym: let's say I have that instant because I'm a clever player and I want to use these instincts as macros in the game to protect me from the game master.

543
00:45:44,126 --> 00:45:46,454
Rym: so if I see an enemy draw my sword.

544
00:45:46,475 --> 00:45:48,321
Rym: so if there's a fight I've already got my sword out.

545
00:45:48,962 --> 00:45:49,825
Rym: I'm in the king's court.

546
00:45:50,486 --> 00:45:53,012
Rym: I'm debating in front of the king.

547
00:45:54,135 --> 00:46:00,794
Rym: my enemy appears to give testimony against me and the game master will look at me and say do you want to draw your sword?

548
00:46:02,399 --> 00:46:03,821
Rym: if I choose not to that's fine.

549
00:46:04,442 --> 00:46:07,084
Rym: if I choose to I basically get experience points.

550
00:46:08,085 --> 00:46:26,915
Rym: burning wheel in particular does this very interesting thing where it reminds you of something that most role-playing games most video games most everything either hide from you or actively try to keep you from experiencing.

551
00:46:27,357 --> 00:46:29,864
Rym: the player and the character are different things.

552
00:46:30,947 --> 00:46:31,991
Rym: a great example of this.

553
00:46:32,051 --> 00:46:36,309
Rym: I usually do this with a co-host up here but imagine you take two people from the audience.

554
00:46:36,329 --> 00:46:37,957
Rym: I'm not going to try to bother doing that.

555
00:46:38,178 --> 00:46:39,163
Rym: you put them up on stage.

556
00:46:39,485 --> 00:46:47,553
Rym: you tell one of them they're Bilbo Baggins and you hand him a ring and then the other characters on the other side you tell Bilbo you have the ring.

557
00:46:48,015 --> 00:46:49,541
Rym: you don't want anyone to steal the ring from you.

558
00:46:50,284 --> 00:46:53,176
Rym: you tell the other character you'd really like to find the one ring.

559
00:46:53,658 --> 00:46:56,671
Rym: you put them on opposite sides of the room and you say walk past each other.

560
00:46:57,372 --> 00:47:00,879
Rym: they're gonna kind of just walk past each other I each other rarely.

561
00:47:00,899 --> 00:47:08,721
Rym: so that's because by default we always identify too much with our characters.

562
00:47:08,741 --> 00:47:11,391
Rym: we feel like if our character loses we lost.

563
00:47:11,853 --> 00:47:13,960
Rym: now when I'm playing Super Meat Boy that's true.

564
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:15,485
Rym: the challenge is the game.

565
00:47:15,565 --> 00:47:22,408
Rym: so me losing is Super Meat Boy losing but in Chrono Trigger me losing isn't necessarily Chrono losing.

566
00:47:22,428 --> 00:47:27,726
Rym: in a role-playing game me losing might be the funnest thing that's ever happened in that game.

567
00:47:28,609 --> 00:47:34,690
Rym: so as a result if you change the instructions a little bit you tell Bilbo and his friend the exact same rules.

568
00:47:34,951 --> 00:47:43,958
Rym: but then you tell them one more thing you tell them to share information you tell them to do the thing that will make the story interesting.

569
00:47:45,222 --> 00:47:47,369
Rym: and then what happens every time we do this?

570
00:47:47,490 --> 00:48:04,065
Rym: every time we get volunteers the person who's playing Bilbo will walk by like this and suddenly we have a story where if I was a standard D&D player doing my standard thing where I'm guarded I'm really afraid of losing and failing.

571
00:48:04,105 --> 00:48:06,976
Rym: I never want to lose because losing sucks as a result.

572
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:09,245
Rym: I never lose and I never experienced that.

573
00:48:09,586 --> 00:48:16,356
Rym: but your character dying in a game like Burning Wheel your fortress collapsing in a game like your fortress is some of the most fun you can have.

574
00:48:16,758 --> 00:48:18,385
Rym: many of you play Dungeons & Dragons right.

575
00:48:18,847 --> 00:48:20,996
Rym: how many times you tell the story where you beat the dungeon?

576
00:48:21,618 --> 00:48:29,288
Rym: and how many times over dinner late at night you tell the story where you rolled the critical failure and you dropped the McGuffin in the lava?

577
00:48:29,870 --> 00:48:39,882
Rym: my story is it involves us accidentally setting an entire town on fire and killing everyone in it thanks to a poorly timed fireball spell in a sewer that was filled with gas.

578
00:48:42,267 --> 00:48:55,467
Rym: but those are the stories we tell because those stories are interesting and awesome and role-playing games need to take advantage of the fact that you are not your character Burning Wheel the ultimate example of this.

579
00:48:55,868 --> 00:48:59,037
Rym: you can have a belief and or a trait.

580
00:48:59,097 --> 00:49:01,043
Rym: sorry and the trait basically is martyred.

581
00:49:01,865 --> 00:49:11,088
Rym: if your character dies attempting to achieve one of his goals you get experience points effectively for your next character.

582
00:49:13,874 --> 00:49:15,959
Rym: think about what that does to a game.

583
00:49:21,101 --> 00:49:30,211
Rym: so role-playing games have an advantage however because role-playing games in role-playing games in the video sense there's a eyes a eyes.

584
00:49:30,572 --> 00:49:35,032
Rym: as much as I would love to say that this panel is going to be all about procedural content generation and how.

585
00:49:35,052 --> 00:49:40,076
Rym: that's a way to really flesh out the narrative of failure and to have all these branching pads and audio games.

586
00:49:40,417 --> 00:49:50,820
Rym: technology is just not there yet but when you're playing a role-playing game you don't have an AI you have an eye you have a human a human being who can make arbitrary calls to make things interesting.

587
00:49:51,221 --> 00:49:53,590
Rym: that's why games like this can have very complex rules.

588
00:49:53,831 --> 00:50:02,618
Rym: there's a philosophy in indie RPGs like burning wheel say yes or roll the dice if a character says I want to do X I do.

589
00:50:02,678 --> 00:50:04,825
Rym: why I jump out the window I kick down the door.

590
00:50:05,668 --> 00:50:09,361
Rym: either say yes that's awesome that happens or make them roll dice.

591
00:50:09,742 --> 00:50:11,647
Rym: never tell them no without letting them roll dice.

592
00:50:11,667 --> 00:50:32,986
Rym: and thus if a decision or saw choice or an action the character is taking does not have an interesting consequence of failure if the character failing to for gather information in Dungeons & Dragons is the best example of you've got a story you've got a plot and you're the game master and there's a thieves guild and they got to like root out this thieves guild.

593
00:50:33,267 --> 00:50:34,894
Rym: so a character rolls to gather information.

594
00:50:35,959 --> 00:50:37,104
Rym: why would you even haven't rolled that?

595
00:50:37,164 --> 00:50:38,651
Rym: if he fails what are you gonna do?

596
00:50:38,671 --> 00:50:41,964
Rym: have him take 20 have him keep roll until he eventually gets it.

597
00:50:42,666 --> 00:50:43,469
Rym: that's boring.

598
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:55,007
Rym: so you either say yes let them find the information or if you have an interesting idea about what to do with failure then you make them roll dice so that success lets them move onward.

599
00:50:55,448 --> 00:50:58,057
Rym: failure makes the move onward in a different direction.

600
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,270
Rym: the burning wheel book actually gives an example of this.

601
00:51:01,631 --> 00:51:07,213
Rym: if I'm trying to pick a lock and my goal my stated intent I want to pick the lock before the guards get here.

602
00:51:07,976 --> 00:51:19,876
Rym: if I fail that role D&D the default thought would be you fail to pick the lock you break your lock pick something like that but the game suggests instead you do pick the lock you do open the door.

603
00:51:20,137 --> 00:51:24,429
Rym: there is no trap but you open the door as the guards arrive.

604
00:51:26,053 --> 00:51:31,594
Rym: suddenly I've added drama I've added urgency I've added conflict instead of just adding a roadblock.

605
00:51:31,634 --> 00:51:34,569
Rym: instead there's Mario going into pit and I'm going to find a different direction.

606
00:51:34,589 --> 00:51:38,469
Rym: I forced the game to go in a different direction because role-playing games at their heart.

607
00:51:38,952 --> 00:51:41,021
Rym: I'm not going to make up another pretentious definition for this.

608
00:51:41,403 --> 00:51:49,112
Rym: our collaborative storytelling games Dungeons & Dragons tells a very particular kind of story and the rules are focused around that.

609
00:51:49,634 --> 00:51:52,787
Rym: I'm gonna be a dick and say that that story is basically World of Warcraft combat.

610
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:54,173
Rym: it's getting better though.

611
00:51:55,036 --> 00:52:03,891
Rym: fifth editions going in interesting directions but if you want to tell the kinds of stories that Dungeons & Dragons doesn't tell if you want to tell stories we're losing is a narrative.

612
00:52:04,353 --> 00:52:06,240
Rym: look for a system that supports that.

613
00:52:06,661 --> 00:52:16,081
Rym: or even if you're gonna play D&D have a game master who's brilliant and we've all seen videos of brilliant game masters who can at least use those concepts even if they're not playing the game.

614
00:52:16,403 --> 00:52:20,461
Rym: they don't just say you fail to roll the gather information and you don't find the thieves guild.

615
00:52:21,122 --> 00:52:23,387
Rym: if you fail that role you find the thief.

616
00:52:23,427 --> 00:52:24,970
Rym: well the thieves guild finds you.

617
00:52:28,418 --> 00:52:30,202
Rym: so where did we go with all this?

618
00:52:30,242 --> 00:52:33,889
Rym: we touched on a whole bunch of different topics.

619
00:52:35,132 --> 00:52:36,073
Rym: I love science quest.

620
00:52:36,414 --> 00:52:40,522
Rym: one games should be fun.

621
00:52:41,364 --> 00:52:43,749
Rym: games should always be fun.

622
00:52:44,571 --> 00:52:47,116
Rym: games should never not be fun.

623
00:52:47,677 --> 00:52:57,903
Rym: if you're playing a game and you're not having fun either that game is a shitty game or that game is not for you the games for someone else.

624
00:52:58,424 --> 00:53:02,877
Rym: I for example really like balls hard really competitive crazy games.

625
00:53:03,418 --> 00:53:05,104
Rym: those games beat me into the ground.

626
00:53:05,305 --> 00:53:07,112
Rym: they're stressful they're challenging.

627
00:53:07,794 --> 00:53:12,030
Rym: I get enjoyment out of eventually overcoming those or failing to the game is fun for me.

628
00:53:12,392 --> 00:53:16,085
Rym: the losing itself might not be fun but the reward is worth it to me.

629
00:53:16,888 --> 00:53:20,861
Rym: if the reward of Super Meat Boy is not worth it to you don't play Super Meat Boy.

630
00:53:21,162 --> 00:53:23,286
Rym: games that are not fun are terrible games.

631
00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:27,195
Rym: losing is contextual.

632
00:53:27,255 --> 00:53:30,523
Rym: losing is not a necessary part of games.

633
00:53:31,164 --> 00:53:35,155
Rym: some games use losing in order to give you a test of skill.

634
00:53:35,516 --> 00:53:39,267
Rym: some games use losing to let you explore all these crazy spidery deaths.

635
00:53:40,511 --> 00:53:42,498
Rym: but losing is different in games.

636
00:53:42,578 --> 00:53:44,303
Rym: not all games have losing things.

637
00:53:44,343 --> 00:53:46,409
Rym: don't need to have losing to be a game.

638
00:53:48,074 --> 00:53:54,151
Rym: losing effects winning and yes I'm using the word effects in the only verb correct way you can use it here.

639
00:53:55,053 --> 00:53:59,285
Rym: without this or sorry without this you cannot have this.

640
00:54:00,327 --> 00:54:06,345
Rym: if you cannot lose a game that is a test of a skill of some kind then nor can you win that game.

641
00:54:06,787 --> 00:54:12,206
Rym: so if you want to have a game where there's an idea of winning then you need to have an idea of losing.

642
00:54:12,828 --> 00:54:19,412
Rym: if a game is just a movie on to the end and dying is just Mario falling in the pit then the game is not winning and losing.

643
00:54:19,713 --> 00:54:23,808
Rym: the game is just a narrative interactive experience toward an end.

644
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:25,334
Rym: it's an exploration.

645
00:54:25,755 --> 00:54:28,745
Rym: but winning and losing don't mean the same thing that they mean in Silver Surfer.

646
00:54:29,788 --> 00:54:38,814
Rym: and finally if someone ever tries to tell you that something's not a game or that you're not a gamer they're full of shit.

647
00:54:40,678 --> 00:54:41,780
Rym: I hope that was enjoyable.

648
00:54:42,861 --> 00:54:46,222
Rym: I'm afraid I'm mostly out of time.

649
00:54:59,329 --> 00:55:01,590
Rym: this has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

650
00:55:01,610 --> 00:55:06,710
Rym: special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.
