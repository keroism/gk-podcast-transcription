1
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,032
Scott: let's do this.

2
00:00:27,675 --> 00:00:31,160
Rym: so I saw you did like a 60 70 mile bike to rock away this weekend.

3
00:00:31,441 --> 00:00:33,048
Scott: no biked everywhere.

4
00:00:33,068 --> 00:00:34,474
Scott: yeah nothing else to do.

5
00:00:34,494 --> 00:00:44,249
Rym: yeah because I ended up going to the shore Wildwood and while we were there our friends Chris and Anthony were there and we played that Kickstarter game Scoville.

6
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,698
Scott: no based on peppers.

7
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:51,700
Rym: yes you breed peppers and you cross breed them and there's different kinds of peppers.

8
00:00:51,861 --> 00:00:58,442
Rym: so I'm not gonna fully review it because Scott's got to play it all bunch and you gotta play it more but you should have to eat peppers to play the game.

9
00:00:58,462 --> 00:00:59,650
Scott: then it would be a good game right?

10
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:00,576
Rym: that would be interesting.

11
00:01:00,617 --> 00:01:08,632
Scott: if the pepper you at the end of each turn whoever has the lowest number of points must eat one of their peppers or something like that.

12
00:01:09,495 --> 00:01:14,034
Rym: so the gist of it the way it works is that basically you plant peppers like you play.

13
00:01:14,054 --> 00:01:19,199
Rym: everyone plants a pepper like somewhere on the board and then to harvest you walk along the path.

14
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:22,196
Rym: there's a shared space in the middle and you walk three spaces.

15
00:01:22,276 --> 00:01:27,339
Rym: I've seen mechanics like that and ever you crop but you don't walk like square to square.

16
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:34,894
Rym: you walk along the edges of where the peppers are and you collect the pepper that would be bred by the peppers on either side of each space.

17
00:01:36,058 --> 00:01:39,330
Rym: so there's a ghost pepper next to a white pepper.

18
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,378
Rym: then I think daddy gets two white peppers.

19
00:01:41,398 --> 00:01:48,751
Rym: or if there's a red pepper and a red pepper get two red peppers but a red and a green or a red and a blue I think makes a brown.

20
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:51,059
Rym: there's like seven eight.

21
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,504
Rym: now there's like ten or eleven different kinds of peppers mm-hmm and it was a pretty good game.

22
00:01:55,685 --> 00:01:56,873
Rym: I'm actually kind of into it.

23
00:01:56,914 --> 00:02:04,890
Rym: now I gotta play it again though we were kind of in a hurry to get on the road to beat the traffic back to New York because we played it on Sunday like right before we left mm-hmm.

24
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:11,296
Rym: but I feel like this game might be up our alley and I might acquire a copy of it.

25
00:02:11,497 --> 00:02:13,648
Scott: you acquire all the stuff you want in your house.

26
00:02:14,372 --> 00:02:15,437
Rym: oh you're done buying board games.

27
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:17,106
Scott: I'm gonna be selling a lot of stuff.

28
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:17,648
Scott: I need room.

29
00:02:17,668 --> 00:02:19,778
Rym: yeah thing is very few.

30
00:02:19,838 --> 00:02:21,829
Rym: the board games I own I'm kind of willing.

31
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:27,258
Rym: the only game I still own that I'm willing to part with is Gloria Mundi because that game is kind of just bad like.

32
00:02:27,318 --> 00:02:31,618
Scott: really I have games that you know don't get played and I don't really care.

33
00:02:31,638 --> 00:02:32,201
Rym: do you own it?

34
00:02:32,221 --> 00:02:32,984
Rym: you know the clips right.

35
00:02:33,326 --> 00:02:35,236
Scott: I got an eclipse but I'll keep my clip.

36
00:02:35,417 --> 00:02:37,186
Rym: oh oh but when are you gonna play that again?

37
00:02:37,447 --> 00:02:37,830
Scott: I'll play it.

38
00:02:38,634 --> 00:02:41,453
Rym: when it was the last time you opened that eclipse I don't know.

39
00:02:41,473 --> 00:02:42,701
Scott: but you never know what an eclipse will happen.

40
00:02:42,942 --> 00:02:46,733
Rym: yeah we should just start playing some eclipse.

41
00:02:47,636 --> 00:02:50,866
Scott: but I got games like lahav and which is not a you know.

42
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:57,542
Scott: okay like turning taxes like these are not bad games but I'm not gonna play them and they're taking up a lot of space relative.

43
00:02:57,683 --> 00:02:58,528
Scott: yeah you know what I realize.

44
00:02:58,568 --> 00:03:02,551
Rym: those are the kinds of games that I kind of would want to keep like I have Puerto Rico.

45
00:03:02,571 --> 00:03:03,134
Scott: I got T&E.

46
00:03:03,194 --> 00:03:06,011
Rym: I'm good but they're good games to own as like a collection of.

47
00:03:06,051 --> 00:03:07,399
Rym: like you have a board game night.

48
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:08,003
Rym: you're like all right.

49
00:03:08,043 --> 00:03:08,326
Rym: here's it.

50
00:03:08,346 --> 00:03:09,836
Rym: here's the game you guys have never played.

51
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:10,781
Scott: oh you want him then.

52
00:03:11,143 --> 00:03:15,558
Rym: but that sentiment only applied when I lived in a house.

53
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:18,093
Scott: yeah you want you want those games now that I live in an apartment.

54
00:03:18,133 --> 00:03:19,764
Rym: no you want you want Gloria Mundi.

55
00:03:19,784 --> 00:03:21,814
Rym: no I will keep to call though.

56
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:23,603
Scott: cuz oh wait Gloria Mundi which one's that?

57
00:03:23,744 --> 00:03:25,273
Rym: the one do you really don't remember?

58
00:03:25,293 --> 00:03:25,696
Scott: is that?

59
00:03:25,716 --> 00:03:28,511
Scott: is that the one with the god chasing you is the gods chasing you.

60
00:03:28,753 --> 00:03:29,698
Scott: oh you should play that.

61
00:03:29,778 --> 00:03:31,105
Rym: that game sucks though?

62
00:03:31,186 --> 00:03:31,829
Scott: no it doesn't.

63
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,216
Rym: you don't remember playing it?

64
00:03:33,236 --> 00:03:33,900
Scott: don't remember?

65
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,664
Scott: it was kind of fun.

66
00:03:34,704 --> 00:03:35,570
Scott: run away from the god.

67
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:38,989
Rym: yeah there that was fun but the actual game just came down to you.

68
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:39,814
Rym: always pay the god.

69
00:03:39,834 --> 00:03:40,397
Scott: well it wasn't.

70
00:03:40,437 --> 00:03:42,708
Scott: let's pay it again one more time as I can remember.

71
00:03:42,728 --> 00:03:47,494
Rym: I think the last time we played it was a New Year's party maybe but I forgot about those.

72
00:03:47,595 --> 00:03:48,199
Rym: I could get it out.

73
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:49,044
Rym: we could play it again if we're.

74
00:03:49,124 --> 00:03:52,826
Rym: the thing is if we play it again and do a show on it we're also getting up.

75
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:54,476
Scott: you did show in it like a hundred years ago.

76
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:57,633
Rym: how about this though cuz you seem to have fonder memories of it than I do.

77
00:03:58,236 --> 00:04:00,487
Rym: let's bust out to call and Gloria Mundi.

78
00:04:00,508 --> 00:04:01,874
Scott: but it calls okay game.

79
00:04:01,995 --> 00:04:03,744
Rym: yeah let's play each once and then review them again.

80
00:04:03,764 --> 00:04:05,031
Scott: there's nothing wrong with the car.

81
00:04:05,071 --> 00:04:13,615
Rym: yeah but see like the last time I played to call was actually a long time ago I wonder what if my opinion will change you just having walk around digging up pyramids?

82
00:04:14,037 --> 00:04:17,995
Rym: yeah put your own machine gun guy on top of the one most valuable pyramid right.

83
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:19,000
Rym: go after the tents.

84
00:04:19,062 --> 00:04:20,290
Rym: except no the tents are never good.

85
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:22,442
Scott: I hope the volcano shows up at the good time for you.

86
00:04:22,542 --> 00:04:23,064
Rym: yeah.

87
00:04:24,309 --> 00:04:29,865
Rym: so uh yeah the main thing going on right now that's been going on for a while it's over now.

88
00:04:30,266 --> 00:04:31,709
Rym: yeah I guess it's completely over right?

89
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:37,806
Rym: I yeah I'll get second.

90
00:04:37,846 --> 00:04:38,651
Rym: I guess that was the last day.

91
00:04:38,872 --> 00:04:40,682
Rym: yes as usual it's the miracle.

92
00:04:40,702 --> 00:04:42,392
Rym: we have enough energy to do blah blah blah blah blah.

93
00:04:42,694 --> 00:04:44,282
Rym: so yeah summer games done quick.

94
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:49,045
Rym: the secret to summer games done quick is to watch them all on YouTube after the fact.

95
00:04:49,267 --> 00:04:51,098
Rym: so you don't get ads like you do in the twitch stream.

96
00:04:51,118 --> 00:04:53,050
Scott: I don't get ads in the twitch stream with my ad block.

97
00:04:53,654 --> 00:04:55,727
Rym: your ad block - actually I've never used ad block with twitch.

98
00:04:55,747 --> 00:04:56,692
Rym: does it just block the ad?

99
00:04:57,034 --> 00:05:01,197
Scott: I mean I'm using you block origin or micro block origin whatever you want to call it.

100
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:05,718
Scott: but even when I used ad block plus I never see ads on YouTube or on twitch.

101
00:05:05,799 --> 00:05:08,794
Rym: I don't see on YouTube but I see the first ad on twitch.

102
00:05:08,935 --> 00:05:11,307
Scott: I don't see any ad on twitch unless I use like my phone or something.

103
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:18,014
Rym: yeah and the twitch app yeah summer games done quick was a pretty good run this year.

104
00:05:18,034 --> 00:05:20,223
Scott: yeah I mean we already had a GDQ.

105
00:05:20,243 --> 00:05:21,791
Scott: right awesome games done quick.

106
00:05:21,812 --> 00:05:23,681
Scott: so they have two events summer games done quick.

107
00:05:23,742 --> 00:05:24,948
Scott: this year it was in like st.

108
00:05:25,008 --> 00:05:26,475
Scott: Paul Minnesota or something.

109
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:34,890
Scott: but they got a surprising turnout of runners showing up to this thing not net runners speed runners who put on quite a display.

110
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:39,104
Scott: they had four-way Super Metroid race which is always the highlight.

111
00:05:39,485 --> 00:05:42,438
Scott: the correct choice of save the animals was the winner.

112
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,746
Scott: yeah as it was last time as well.

113
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:47,394
Scott: for the Tetris.

114
00:05:47,755 --> 00:05:49,180
Scott: you know the grand master edition.

115
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,237
Scott: you know they put the pretty good show on with that the last time.

116
00:05:52,297 --> 00:05:55,432
Scott: this time they brought over people from Japan.

117
00:05:55,452 --> 00:06:00,375
Scott: so they had like probably the best collection of Tetris players ever assembled in a single location.

118
00:06:00,395 --> 00:06:06,760
Rym: I was particularly enjoying the gauntlet one because I did not actually know as a kid.

119
00:06:06,921 --> 00:06:10,177
Rym: I bet gauntlet 2. it was the first one I got on the NES.

120
00:06:10,217 --> 00:06:15,860
Rym: I played gauntlet in the arcade and I got gauntlet 2 which is pretty much like the arcade on the NES.

121
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:21,783
Rym: and then later I got gauntlet 1. and how this weird shit like a map and all the stuff I didn't get.

122
00:06:21,803 --> 00:06:24,696
Rym: I didn't know you could beat gauntlet 1.

123
00:06:24,696 --> 00:06:25,339
Scott: of course you can.

124
00:06:25,661 --> 00:06:27,955
Scott: no I didn't know you just like a lot of money to be gone.

125
00:06:27,995 --> 00:06:29,462
Rym: it's gonna - just goes on forever.

126
00:06:30,346 --> 00:06:36,475
Rym: but yeah gauntlet 1 the best part about the speed run is he starts going then he gets his password and he's like no no no stop the clock.

127
00:06:37,058 --> 00:06:37,902
Rym: we got to start over.

128
00:06:38,284 --> 00:06:41,057
Rym: my password started with an a. the game is unbeatable.

129
00:06:41,338 --> 00:06:50,386
Rym: yeah really there's a bug where if your password starts with an a then the game is unbeatable yep because you need to type in that code at the end yep and you won't be able to like it.

130
00:06:50,406 --> 00:06:51,552
Rym: just won't happen all right.

131
00:06:51,713 --> 00:06:56,173
Scott: other interesting runs that I saw during the weekend of awesomeness.

132
00:06:56,294 --> 00:06:59,026
Scott: obviously simply a night race is always a good show.

133
00:06:59,046 --> 00:07:02,928
Scott: yep all right you know it was pretty good - well I mean all the classics are at.

134
00:07:02,948 --> 00:07:04,921
Scott: the ones they have every single time are always good.

135
00:07:04,961 --> 00:07:06,348
Scott: that's why they have them every single time.

136
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:10,585
Scott: right but there was a the majority way to.

137
00:07:11,588 --> 00:07:13,033
Scott: the majora's mass is crazy.

138
00:07:13,354 --> 00:07:15,079
Scott: the earthbound was pretty crazy.

139
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,475
Rym: I'm going to watch the chrono trigger the Oregon Trail.

140
00:07:19,515 --> 00:07:21,261
Scott: they had an Apple to GS up ends.

141
00:07:21,281 --> 00:07:25,669
Scott: there was a super Noah's Ark 3d that didn't watch it but I want to.

142
00:07:25,689 --> 00:07:26,754
Rym: I don't know.

143
00:07:26,834 --> 00:07:27,257
Rym: that's just.

144
00:07:27,317 --> 00:07:27,920
Rym: it's just.

145
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:31,864
Rym: I don't feel like see watching that one that feels like it won't be fun unless I keep very funny.

146
00:07:31,965 --> 00:07:37,537
Scott: a lot of the ones that like you're like I'm not sure if I want to watch this are very short and it's like oh it's only like five minutes.

147
00:07:37,617 --> 00:07:38,943
Scott: okay let's see what the deal is.

148
00:07:38,964 --> 00:07:52,727
Rym: oh yeah like the it wasn't this time it was a while ago but super pitfall is actually a great speedrun to watch even though super pitfalls an awful game because the guy is really really funny and he knows a lot about the game.

149
00:07:52,928 --> 00:07:56,318
Scott: yeah there was a crazy Pokemon blue situations going on.

150
00:07:56,358 --> 00:07:57,160
Scott: I have to watch those.

151
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:57,501
Scott: still.

152
00:07:57,521 --> 00:08:01,673
Scott: there was oh the Taz bot.

153
00:08:01,754 --> 00:08:02,778
Scott: you know which is the tool?

154
00:08:02,798 --> 00:08:09,672
Scott: assisted speedrun yeah but it played Megaman one and did crazy glitches which is you know kind of interesting for about a minute.

155
00:08:10,074 --> 00:08:11,298
Scott: but the Ikaruga one.

156
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:16,219
Scott: it basically gets the maximum achievable score to player Ikaruga.

157
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:18,530
Scott: it's both players are being controlled by the bot.

158
00:08:19,872 --> 00:08:23,989
Scott: and I think the highlight this year was the chrono trigger at the end.

159
00:08:24,049 --> 00:08:26,362
Scott: but I haven't watched that either because it's four hours.

160
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:32,456
Scott: I need to find four hours of time to set aside which is actually a lot less time than it would take for me to play chrono trigger again.

161
00:08:32,476 --> 00:08:33,621
Rym: oh god yeah.

162
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,630
Scott: so I'm like oh I'll just watch this.

163
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:41,004
Scott: and then I wanted to play chrono trigger again because I think it's a hundred percent chrono trigger 100% co-op runs.

164
00:08:41,044 --> 00:08:42,068
Rym: I guess they switched in and out.

165
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:48,961
Rym: yeah I guess people you know well there was an incentive for a hundred percent so they didn't have to I guess but I guess more.

166
00:08:48,981 --> 00:08:51,555
Scott: I think I think basically the way it works is like that.

167
00:08:51,635 --> 00:09:04,584
Scott: one of theirs one of his sponsors is the Yeti which is the t-shirt site which isn't bad and the Yeti basically like matches donations that everyone's making you know and also sponsors.

168
00:09:04,946 --> 00:09:08,886
Scott: but what they do is they end up actually just sending in their donations just like everyone else does.

169
00:09:08,906 --> 00:09:10,655
Scott: only they're from the Yeti.

170
00:09:11,358 --> 00:09:18,030
Scott: so you know they'll be reading off donations and they always read the donations from the Yeti right because it's the big sponsor.

171
00:09:19,131 --> 00:09:27,544
Scott: so whenever they read the Yeti donations the Yeti always basically fills in every single incentive with the thousands of dollars you know donating.

172
00:09:27,564 --> 00:09:30,156
Rym: but yeah if you you know we talked.

173
00:09:30,176 --> 00:09:31,828
Rym: we mentioned this was coming a long time ago.

174
00:09:31,869 --> 00:09:32,896
Rym: then we didn't talk about it again.

175
00:09:32,956 --> 00:09:34,848
Rym: but just go watch all the stuff on YouTube.

176
00:09:34,889 --> 00:09:35,854
Rym: some of these are great.

177
00:09:36,055 --> 00:09:40,759
Scott: watching live does have a certain you know especially if you got people on Twitter who are talking about it.

178
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:42,409
Scott: so luckily no one I follow on Twitter.

179
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:43,877
Scott: the Twitch chat is worthless.

180
00:09:43,937 --> 00:09:51,235
Rym: the only one of these that anyone in my like follow group talked about on Twitter was the Chrono Trigger and I avoided spoilers.

181
00:09:51,336 --> 00:09:53,045
Rym: I don't know if they saved Magus or not.

182
00:09:53,367 --> 00:09:54,272
Scott: I don't know how it works either.

183
00:09:54,292 --> 00:09:54,714
Scott: they better.

184
00:09:54,774 --> 00:09:55,799
Rym: they better save Magus.

185
00:09:55,819 --> 00:09:56,462
Rym: fuck frog.

186
00:09:57,165 --> 00:09:58,250
Scott: what frog is my man?

187
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,615
Scott: yeah but Magus is so much.

188
00:10:00,258 --> 00:10:03,170
Scott: so much sword with also Magus floats on the overworld.

189
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:06,167
Rym: so make him your leader and like why would you ever do anything else?

190
00:10:06,328 --> 00:10:07,012
Scott: so much sword?

191
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:08,843
Rym: so in other news remember that's old game.

192
00:10:08,883 --> 00:10:13,523
Rym: we did a show on this on GeekNights like what six years ago longer.

193
00:10:13,603 --> 00:10:20,357
Scott: well see it's a very unique and high quality game that's been around for a long time and is you know managed to keep going despite you know yeah

194
00:10:20,397 --> 00:10:23,407
Rym: but there is the battle for Wesna

195
00:10:23,848 --> 00:10:31,804
Scott: was just like an open-source turn-based strategy game that has had of active community and has gradually improved over years and years and years

196
00:10:31,985 --> 00:10:34,519
Rym: or possibly gotten worse because the campaign's kept breaking.

197
00:10:35,424 --> 00:10:36,873
Scott: maybe but never played the campaigns.

198
00:10:36,913 --> 00:10:38,042
Scott: we really just played multiplayer.

199
00:10:38,062 --> 00:10:39,010
Rym: yeah well the game was it.

200
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:49,192
Rym: it's interesting because this is one of the rare examples of a large game like a very large completely large that I'd say it's very large in terms of the framework.

201
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:54,521
Rym: I mean it has a whole framework and its own scripting language just for making all those scenarios sure.

202
00:10:54,561 --> 00:11:03,120
Rym: yeah it also has like the backend and the netcode and a significant amount of moderately well-drawn art assets and poorly drawn hard assets.

203
00:11:03,382 --> 00:11:04,427
Scott: well it's an open-source game.

204
00:11:04,447 --> 00:11:05,714
Scott: what do you think the heart's gonna be like?

205
00:11:05,814 --> 00:11:10,576
Rym: but I'm hard-pressed to name larger open-source game projects.

206
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:14,489
Scott: oh there was that FPS that was like a quake clone thingy.

207
00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:16,156
Scott: what was that thing called?

208
00:11:16,257 --> 00:11:21,623
Scott: I forget yeah there you go but was frozen frozen bubbles usually the example of open-source game right.

209
00:11:21,663 --> 00:11:23,352
Scott: so it was not this pretty great by comparison.

210
00:11:23,413 --> 00:11:25,020
Rym: but was not this having a problem?

211
00:11:25,061 --> 00:11:28,557
Rym: apparently there's no one left to write code for it.

212
00:11:28,738 --> 00:11:32,213
Scott: oh like the people are starting to quit now that it's been like a 20 year old.

213
00:11:32,273 --> 00:11:36,127
Rym: to quote the article the ship is sinking.

214
00:11:36,508 --> 00:11:40,556
Scott: the project is that but if someone wrote the ship is sinking that means someone's on the ship to write that it's.

215
00:11:40,576 --> 00:11:48,005
Rym: there are a few people on the ship but basically they need people with C++ Python and WML programming.

216
00:11:48,045 --> 00:11:50,895
Scott: well WML is the was not markup language.

217
00:11:51,216 --> 00:11:54,210
Scott: nobody knows the Wesnoth markup language unless they're already.

218
00:11:54,331 --> 00:11:55,236
Scott: it was not person.

219
00:11:55,437 --> 00:11:57,510
Scott: so you're gonna need people to learn the Wesnoth markup.

220
00:11:57,851 --> 00:11:58,313
Scott: if you

221
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:01,926
Rym: are a punk kid and you want something to do to like

222
00:12:02,468 --> 00:12:05,805
Scott: and you like turn-based strategy games like Advance Wars only with fantasy themes

223
00:12:05,946 --> 00:12:12,016
Rym: yep this project is hurting for developers enough that you can probably have a lot of influence in a hurry

224
00:12:12,338 --> 00:12:14,309
Scott: on a game that a lot of people kind of care about.

225
00:12:14,349 --> 00:12:18,809
Rym: yeah but - uh I don't think it's gonna make it and has miners start.

226
00:12:18,829 --> 00:12:20,520
Scott: you don't think you think it's gonna be the end of Wesnoth.

227
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,411
Rym: I think Wesnoth is not bloody.

228
00:12:22,432 --> 00:12:24,118
Scott: Foxton has come to be.

229
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:34,847
Rym: Foxton is the final resting place of these sad souls okay so part of the problem I saw is that I was reading through it like slash shot which is not the most but slash does is the very Wesnoth.

230
00:12:35,309 --> 00:12:36,494
Scott: that's a place that was not.

231
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:46,762
Rym: so it's interesting because a lot of accounts with way old numbers on slash shot like my people suddenly appeared suddenly talk about was not yeah and more than one of them was like.

232
00:12:47,043 --> 00:12:50,319
Rym: I tried to contribute but the developers are assholes and things.

233
00:12:50,359 --> 00:12:55,644
Rym: I believe that I believe that there seems to be an infinite amount of drama around this project.

234
00:12:55,665 --> 00:12:56,750
Scott: listen an open-source world.

235
00:12:56,871 --> 00:12:58,198
Scott: somehow assholes get shit done.

236
00:12:58,238 --> 00:12:58,781
Scott: look at Linux.

237
00:12:58,982 --> 00:13:09,296
Rym: yeah but I think the problem is that games like this really need like game design independently of the coding and the changes there.

238
00:13:09,316 --> 00:13:16,675
Rym: well it's not always had some design issues exactly but the people who were the best coders were also the ones who had a lot of the input over the design.

239
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:19,206
Scott: you just code and you you set the design right.

240
00:13:19,226 --> 00:13:20,912
Scott: yeah there's no director.

241
00:13:21,093 --> 00:13:24,563
Guest: what you're describing right now is open source UX in general.

242
00:13:24,824 --> 00:13:31,548
Rym: I mean the gimp is totally fine right sure I haven't I don't know.

243
00:13:31,588 --> 00:13:32,694
Scott: maybe the gimps improved now.

244
00:13:32,815 --> 00:13:34,507
Scott: I pay for real photoshop now so I don't know.

245
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:36,156
Rym: I have real Photoshop and I work out of the gimp.

246
00:13:36,197 --> 00:13:38,288
Rym: so my workflow is do a bunch of stuff.

247
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:39,556
Rym: why the fuck is this broken?

248
00:13:39,676 --> 00:13:41,186
Rym: flatten image continue working?

249
00:13:41,206 --> 00:13:43,636
Rym: why the fake leaf is broken flatten image continue going.

250
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:48,031
Rym: I made a layer once and that ended my project.

251
00:13:48,312 --> 00:14:01,757
Rym: okay but uh I made a layer once Wesnoth just was never quite there and that that WML language kept changing with no backward compatibility and they kept changing gameplay stuff.

252
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,689
Rym: so they had a lot of people who made a lot of.

253
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:14,298
Rym: they change the language without changing the campaign or the coders change subtle gameplay things that broke the campaigns because oh yeah you can't win this one now because that dude just isn't strong enough.

254
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:15,544
Scott: stuff like that.

255
00:14:15,664 --> 00:14:21,207
Rym: like there is no way to have dependencies on gameplay in scenarios and vice versa.

256
00:14:21,448 --> 00:14:25,245
Rym: there's no way to like snapshot or freeze like sets of game mechanics.

257
00:14:25,305 --> 00:14:26,832
Rym: so the project is such a big mess.

258
00:14:26,892 --> 00:14:44,221
Rym: that sure in my opinion unless they freeze that language and they freeze gameplay and design and focus only on fixing the code and bugs and issues for a while and have a stable platform for a while I don't think this thing's ever gonna get beyond where it is right now.

259
00:14:44,241 --> 00:14:48,103
Scott: well who knows I haven't played it in years and I wasn't really planning to play it again.

260
00:14:48,123 --> 00:14:50,014
Rym: yeah thing is as fun as it was.

261
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:50,980
Rym: it was no advanced wars.

262
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:51,946
Scott: no it wasn't.

263
00:14:51,966 --> 00:14:53,474
Guest: that wasn't Alex working on that.

264
00:14:53,957 --> 00:15:01,853
Scott: I mean he did it for a little bit back and when we were really playing it you know he made I think he made some sprites for it maybe and yeah I did some stuff.

265
00:15:02,516 --> 00:15:03,360
Scott: it was way back.

266
00:15:03,823 --> 00:15:11,642
Rym: yeah the part of the trouble is the game never got polished enough to be worth investing the time and being great at it partly because the gameplay kept changing.

267
00:15:12,325 --> 00:15:16,441
Rym: like I'm good at advanced wars I wouldn't be good at advanced wars like revision 809 build 7.

268
00:15:16,441 --> 00:15:21,326
Scott: yeah it's like every time there's new advances you had to relearn it anyway right?

269
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:22,978
Scott: yeah it's constantly changing.

270
00:15:23,058 --> 00:15:24,065
Scott: it's difficult and you know what that's.

271
00:15:24,086 --> 00:15:24,368
Scott: why not?

272
00:15:24,388 --> 00:15:25,052
Scott: runner is awesome.

273
00:15:25,112 --> 00:15:36,706
Rym: but yeah I'll link to the slash down article because the comments is a lot of people who know a lot about Wes Knopf pretty much shedding light on things and linking to like old bugs they opened in 2008.

274
00:15:36,706 --> 00:15:38,010
Scott: let me show you my Ubuntu bug.

275
00:15:40,812 --> 00:16:07,567
Rym: so but anyway things of the day I want for you an AGD Q not an SDG Q. but this is a game that I was a kid I played and well I rented from blockbuster because it had really good box art and looked like it had good graphics and we my brother and I couldn't get out of like the first two screens and we did not get out of those things

276
00:16:07,587 --> 00:16:10,222
Scott: later once and couldn't get past the first two screens.

277
00:16:10,282 --> 00:16:12,976
Rym: yeah in the whole weekend and we took the game back.

278
00:16:13,036 --> 00:16:25,463
Scott: I mean I only spent about ten minutes on it and this game haunted me but not enough to go figure it out why this game haunts me because every time I go to a convention magfest packs anywhere and there's always that one booth selling the retro games.

279
00:16:25,503 --> 00:16:27,675
Scott: they've got a whole bunch of overpriced NES cartridges.

280
00:16:27,716 --> 00:16:32,498
Scott: yeah this game is 100% of the time always in the library and the selection available.

281
00:16:32,719 --> 00:16:45,316
Rym: so this is a speedrun of that game and a huge lingering chapter of my childhood unresolved hitherto has henceforth been resolved and I have closure.

282
00:16:45,336 --> 00:16:49,070
Rym: also the in this game pretty good kind of catchy yeah.

283
00:16:49,692 --> 00:16:53,651
Scott: so the SGD Q sort of you know always inspires you to try to be a speedrunner.

284
00:16:53,671 --> 00:17:02,760
Scott: yeah I opened up Mame and I wanted to play Tetris Grandmaster myself and I played it a bit and yeah I couldn't get past like level 100 something and that took me four minutes.

285
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:08,426
Scott: meanwhile four minutes in those guys like at level 900 or whatever just takes practice 800 who knows.

286
00:17:08,507 --> 00:17:13,336
Scott: yeah obviously I don't think that there's any amount of practice I could put in that would get me at their level.

287
00:17:13,415 --> 00:17:15,910
Scott: I could be better obviously but not as good as them.

288
00:17:16,432 --> 00:17:18,582
Scott: so while I had my meme open I tried some other things.

289
00:17:18,643 --> 00:17:25,097
Scott: I played some Dodon Pachi and whatever and then I realized whoa I'm sitting here with my joystick playing all these arcade games.

290
00:17:25,117 --> 00:17:28,215
Scott: you know there's I can just play Street Fighter championship edition.

291
00:17:28,497 --> 00:17:30,992
Scott: it's just right here you know just like the old arcade days.

292
00:17:31,013 --> 00:17:31,616
Scott: so I opened it up.

293
00:17:31,636 --> 00:17:32,180
Scott: I start playing.

294
00:17:32,903 --> 00:17:33,927
Scott: you know my guy M bison.

295
00:17:33,947 --> 00:17:36,397
Scott: yeah and you know this is on arcade.

296
00:17:36,457 --> 00:17:37,039
Scott: hard mode.

297
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:42,881
Scott: make you lose quarters mode and I get to review the fifth guy and I just can't win.

298
00:17:43,042 --> 00:17:46,717
Scott: and I was like what the fuck I used to be my that old.

299
00:17:46,777 --> 00:17:47,419
Scott: I can't even win.

300
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,331
Scott: and it's like I take a round and then lose two rounds.

301
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:53,827
Scott: some like let me go on the internet and find a video.

302
00:17:53,847 --> 00:17:55,256
Scott: you know a beating for you.

303
00:17:55,277 --> 00:17:57,895
Scott: maybe there's something I'm doing wrong and there was something to doing wrong I forgot.

304
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:05,960
Scott: the thing in that game is that M bison middle kick basically just beats everything because it has so much as so much reach and it has some and it has enough strength.

305
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,693
Scott: you can basically just middle kick your way through the game.

306
00:18:07,793 --> 00:18:09,242
Rym: yeah welcome back to my nightmares.

307
00:18:09,764 --> 00:18:18,406
Scott: but anyway while I was searching for like you know I want to see a video of someone beating were you like just like destroying him and Street Fighter championship in arcade.

308
00:18:18,426 --> 00:18:20,795
Scott: I found this video on YouTube.

309
00:18:21,257 --> 00:18:24,249
Scott: I know none of you have seen this because it has so few views.

310
00:18:24,972 --> 00:18:32,822
Scott: it is some dude just some dude who is reminiscing about playing this game and he's playing it and he beats for you.

311
00:18:33,123 --> 00:18:35,811
Scott: but the things he said it's like.

312
00:18:35,852 --> 00:18:41,814
Scott: this is like some glorious video that is completely hidden on the internet that no one knows.

313
00:18:41,834 --> 00:18:43,401
Scott: it has like maybe tens of you.

314
00:18:43,481 --> 00:18:46,831
Rym: it has 21 views and one like which I assume is you.

315
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:48,175
Scott: yes that's my life.

316
00:18:48,196 --> 00:18:51,888
Scott: this video is worth watching.

317
00:18:51,989 --> 00:18:52,511
Scott: I don't know why.

318
00:18:52,873 --> 00:18:54,259
Scott: what's up with this undiscovered guy?

319
00:18:54,280 --> 00:19:00,616
Scott: I didn't even look to see if it is the only other videos both posted on his own published recently but if he does I want to watch them.

320
00:19:00,757 --> 00:19:03,435
Rym: here are some random fights in Street Fighter 2 champion edition arcade.

321
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,703
Rym: this is the classic fighting game this.

322
00:19:04,965 --> 00:19:06,594
Rym: well there's a lot of description here.

323
00:19:06,796 --> 00:19:08,724
Rym: here's my flicker here's my.

324
00:19:09,006 --> 00:19:10,213
Rym: alright I guess he's a photographer.

325
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:11,099
Scott: yeah but whoever?

326
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:14,379
Scott: I don't even know who this guy is but you just have to watch this and listen to him.

327
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,540
Rym: Alexander's say and look here's a bunch of black and white pictures he took.

328
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,305
Guest: Alexander you are in link is tinder.

329
00:19:22,514 --> 00:19:25,323
Rym: let's see flicker another photography another tiger.

330
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:27,031
Rym: no no whatever.

331
00:19:27,091 --> 00:19:30,850
Scott: but we'll watch this after the show is over and you'll see the glory that this man has made.

332
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,337
Scott: I mean this YouTube video.

333
00:19:32,358 --> 00:19:36,613
Rym: in the moment the booklet book is still fantasy book volume one.

334
00:19:38,258 --> 00:19:39,382
Scott: I've read much more of it.

335
00:19:39,844 --> 00:19:48,257
Rym: I'm you're probably ahead of me now because I left off when they were in the town after they landed from the ship being stupid again.

336
00:19:48,277 --> 00:19:49,262
Scott: yeah I'm a little after that.

337
00:19:49,524 --> 00:19:51,053
Rym: are they still being stupid?

338
00:19:51,133 --> 00:19:51,797
Scott: they left that town.

339
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:52,922
Rym: are all the kids still alive?

340
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:57,637
Rym: yeah I wish just one or two of them would not make it.

341
00:19:58,159 --> 00:19:59,503
Scott: I think the times are coming soon.

342
00:20:01,209 --> 00:20:02,312
Scott: man the wolf sent something.

343
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:08,803
Rym: I just I suspect and I worry that the characters that like the least are the ones who are in the most pages of the wheel of.

344
00:20:08,823 --> 00:20:14,813
Scott: there are so many pages though I assume that they'll make newer characters who you may like or hate more or less.

345
00:20:15,034 --> 00:20:18,111
Rym: but I pretty much only like adults and hate children so far in these books.

346
00:20:18,654 --> 00:20:21,227
Rym: I don't know if that says anything about the books or about me.

347
00:20:21,267 --> 00:20:23,096
Scott: I have to agree with that anyway.

348
00:20:23,497 --> 00:20:27,891
Rym: also we are going to be live at PAX Prime on real packs.

349
00:20:27,932 --> 00:20:31,262
Rym: yeah the far future of one true gaming con.

350
00:20:31,402 --> 00:20:34,733
Rym: all roads lead to Rome room the mecca of nerds.

351
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,462
Rym: yeah so Sunday far future of gaming.

352
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:45,974
Rym: Monday sports our games which is getting increasingly topical what with the doping scandal in video game tournaments lately?

353
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:57,317
Rym: and then on Wednesday in Portland I am giving a lecture not GeekNights just me on UX in video games at Kifu in Portland the computer human interaction forum of Oregon.

354
00:20:57,739 --> 00:20:59,207
Scott: I'm sure so many people show up there.

355
00:20:59,267 --> 00:21:00,536
Scott: it sounds like such a hot place.

356
00:21:00,556 --> 00:21:05,846
Rym: a lot of people go to this thing like Mike Seliger lectured not too long ago and I know who that is bunch of packs that people were there.

357
00:21:05,947 --> 00:21:16,461
Rym: so okay apparently someone from PAX dev knew us and saw me lecture at another packs and nominated me to be a lecturer here.

358
00:21:16,522 --> 00:21:18,429
Rym: so that's how that happened as far as I could tell.

359
00:21:18,831 --> 00:21:20,919
Rym: okay so yeah we got up.

360
00:21:21,241 --> 00:21:23,374
Rym: we got Conrad Kraling here in the studio if you didn't notice.

361
00:21:23,757 --> 00:21:25,887
Guest: oh yeah hi everybody my name is Conrad Kraling.

362
00:21:27,012 --> 00:21:30,713
Scott: Conrad you have been here before but I wonder how many people listening know who you are.

363
00:21:30,733 --> 00:21:31,377
Rym: it's been a while.

364
00:21:31,398 --> 00:21:33,305
Scott: maybe you should intro duct yourself.

365
00:21:33,445 --> 00:21:34,769
Scott: yeah save me the trouble.

366
00:21:35,953 --> 00:21:38,862
Guest: so hey everybody I'm Conrad Kraling.

367
00:21:39,003 --> 00:21:40,209
Guest: I've been on the show a couple times.

368
00:21:41,093 --> 00:21:48,247
Guest: you might remember me from my last appearance on this show where I gave a rough estimate as to the number of times that I've masturbated in my entire life.

369
00:21:48,548 --> 00:21:50,055
Guest: oh yeah the number has gone up.

370
00:21:50,838 --> 00:21:52,244
Guest: just let me quell any doubts.

371
00:21:52,847 --> 00:21:56,927
Rym: well the question is not how not whether or not it went up but what the diff is like.

372
00:21:56,948 --> 00:22:01,064
Scott: get a measure that why are we drenching to this territory?

373
00:22:01,124 --> 00:22:03,369
Scott: yes also I don't remember that at all.

374
00:22:04,231 --> 00:22:15,284
Guest: I remember it vividly yes so currently I'm working as the founder and lead engineer at my little visual novel company date night.

375
00:22:15,304 --> 00:22:18,055
Rym: oh that's that's a big step up from just working.

376
00:22:18,918 --> 00:22:19,883
Guest: yeah yeah it's not bad.

377
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:23,221
Guest: you mentioned you mentioned that you were going to be live at at PAX.

378
00:22:23,924 --> 00:22:27,840
Guest: one of our people is actually going to be there our product manager Joe foo.

379
00:22:28,241 --> 00:22:34,667
Rym: in fact actually because Joe is on the panel I realized this is like the first time ever I've put together a PAX panel.

380
00:22:34,707 --> 00:22:36,675
Rym: that isn't five to six white dudes.

381
00:22:36,695 --> 00:22:40,789
Rym: there are three ladies and three men on this panel.

382
00:22:41,311 --> 00:22:42,395
Rym: I'm kind of amazed.

383
00:22:42,997 --> 00:22:45,788
Guest: I I mean I'm obviously very happy at date night.

384
00:22:45,968 --> 00:22:54,342
Guest: oh the the idea that we can put work by creators of color and and women forward is like a big part of our mission statement.

385
00:22:54,402 --> 00:22:56,291
Guest: it's it's a big part of what we want to do.

386
00:22:56,431 --> 00:22:59,685
Guest: so thank you so much for helping us to make that happen.

387
00:23:01,252 --> 00:23:02,678
Rym: thing is for here like before date night.

388
00:23:02,758 --> 00:23:10,423
Rym: oh I pretty much submitted panels with your name on them to conventions for years without telling you yeah I'm really sorry that I had such difficulty getting out there.

389
00:23:10,443 --> 00:23:16,682
Guest: I'm really excited about this year though even even just being in the audience and you know having somebody from date night to be on stage it's gonna be dope.

390
00:23:16,742 --> 00:23:17,164
Guest: I'm excited.

391
00:23:17,184 --> 00:23:19,734
Scott: we'll see how many people show up.

392
00:23:20,437 --> 00:23:23,734
Rym: I don't know it's that's the kind of provocative title that the problem is.

393
00:23:23,754 --> 00:23:29,752
Scott: so I've never had a PAX panel with a bad turnout though every time I think it's gonna be a bad turnout I get at least like 50% fillage.

394
00:23:29,772 --> 00:23:30,656
Scott: I know what we weren't?

395
00:23:30,696 --> 00:23:35,254
Rym: we like early morning on Sunday at one point it's usually a good time.

396
00:23:35,274 --> 00:23:38,550
Rym: yeah the only bad time I think is during the Omega thon itself.

397
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:43,479
Scott: well our Mondays is you know they gave this to us last year to our panel Monday at the very end of the con.

398
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,748
Scott: we gotta run to the Omega thon.

399
00:23:44,768 --> 00:23:46,962
Scott: it's like uh but I don't even know if I want to run this year.

400
00:23:47,063 --> 00:23:51,431
Rym: we could do our joke that we do every year of admonishing the people in the audience for seeing us instead of the.

401
00:23:51,592 --> 00:23:52,739
Scott: oh that's definitely gonna happen.

402
00:23:53,021 --> 00:23:54,268
Scott: yeah that is definitely gonna happen.

403
00:23:54,852 --> 00:23:55,959
Rym: so Conrad how's this thing going?

404
00:23:55,979 --> 00:23:58,517
Rym: I mean you're making dating games and I guess some of them actually came out.

405
00:23:58,598 --> 00:23:59,764
Scott: yeah do you make money doing that?

406
00:24:00,066 --> 00:24:09,226
Guest: yeah well uh you know obviously we ran the Star Fighter Eclipse Kickstarter which pulled in I believe a little over $150,000 a lot of money.

407
00:24:09,246 --> 00:24:13,083
Scott: yeah I mean it's not millions but that is way more monies than I have.

408
00:24:13,244 --> 00:24:13,868
Guest: yeah yeah it was.

409
00:24:13,928 --> 00:24:17,350
Guest: it was a rip-roaring start and you know we're still working on fulfillment for that game.

410
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:19,865
Guest: in some ways we're doing the translations right now.

411
00:24:19,885 --> 00:24:21,171
Guest: we did.

412
00:24:21,212 --> 00:24:24,733
Guest: we did get the art book out as well as the soundtrack so we're really excited about that.

413
00:24:24,794 --> 00:24:25,941
Guest: the soundtrack is available on bank.

414
00:24:25,981 --> 00:24:27,891
Scott: how many languages are you translating the?

415
00:24:27,991 --> 00:24:28,554
Guest: so it's five.

416
00:24:28,574 --> 00:24:34,683
Guest: oh yeah it's five and and you know I actually just sent the contract out for our Russian translator.

417
00:24:34,703 --> 00:24:39,043
Guest: so yeah yeah yeah yeah it's actually a really big market for Starfighter.

418
00:24:39,223 --> 00:24:46,495
Guest: so yeah it was kind of a no-brainer for the for the project but yeah so that that actually shipped in May on date night.

419
00:24:46,535 --> 00:24:51,116
Guest: calm it's our first title on you know under our own power and on our own publishing platform.

420
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,409
Guest: you just go to the website you play the game.

421
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:54,537
Guest: there's like no downloads.

422
00:24:54,577 --> 00:24:55,663
Guest: you just buy it and play it it's.

423
00:24:55,824 --> 00:25:06,476
Guest: uh it worked even better like you know obviously like it's my company and like I made the game but it worked even better than like I had imagined like it was so cool being able to just go there and do it.

424
00:25:06,496 --> 00:25:11,962
Guest: we actually have another game coming out in early to mid-september called we know the devil.

425
00:25:12,183 --> 00:25:16,720
Guest: this is a collaboration work with a VB of the other publication zeal.

426
00:25:17,841 --> 00:25:19,550
Guest: we obviously were really excited about.

427
00:25:19,571 --> 00:25:20,858
Guest: I just implemented the UI for that.

428
00:25:20,898 --> 00:25:23,267
Guest: today it looks it looks dope.

429
00:25:23,568 --> 00:25:26,079
Guest: that's in collaboration with Mia Schwartz.

430
00:25:26,099 --> 00:25:29,277
Guest: she's doing the artwork and like you know me as a buddy of mine anyway.

431
00:25:29,297 --> 00:25:30,946
Guest: so I couldn't be more excited about that.

432
00:25:31,247 --> 00:25:38,718
Guest: and then next year February we've got hustle cat our next our next title about magical boys and girls working in the cat cafe.

433
00:25:38,738 --> 00:25:39,803
Scott: who doesn't like that?

434
00:25:39,823 --> 00:25:43,602
Scott: I mean if that had a full boyfriend pigeon dating came out right.

435
00:25:43,682 --> 00:25:45,312
Scott: I mean that's like ten times better.

436
00:25:45,574 --> 00:25:47,042
Guest: I'm actually gonna leak something.

437
00:25:47,062 --> 00:25:48,268
Guest: this will be a GeekNights'.

438
00:25:48,469 --> 00:25:52,812
Rym: exclusive people are listening and I know the listeners gonna appreciate this a lot.

439
00:25:52,893 --> 00:25:53,939
Guest: yeah I think so too.

440
00:25:54,401 --> 00:26:00,766
Guest: Audra Feruichi of Nemu Nemu is actually doing the cat sprites for us on hustle cat that just happened.

441
00:26:00,786 --> 00:26:01,851
Guest: she's doing the designs.

442
00:26:02,133 --> 00:26:03,298
Guest: I'm so excited.

443
00:26:03,318 --> 00:26:05,430
Guest: so these are definitely the most important.

444
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:08,266
Rym: yeah right they've got to be real accurate or people are gonna be really mad.

445
00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:10,177
Guest: well they at least have to be real cute.

446
00:26:10,197 --> 00:26:12,610
Guest: that's really all I'm looking for is really accurate.

447
00:26:13,073 --> 00:26:15,709
Guest: but yeah we're actually in talks about doing a Kickstarter for that.

448
00:26:16,132 --> 00:26:18,366
Guest: we think we think we're gonna give crowdfunding a shot on that.

449
00:26:18,486 --> 00:26:21,682
Scott: so if the other one made 150 why wouldn't you do it again?

450
00:26:21,822 --> 00:26:36,448
Guest: yeah I will say that I think this is a an interesting new challenge for us because rather than being able to leverage an existing and let's face it really popular property like Hamlet machine starfighter we are kind of driving under our own power.

451
00:26:36,488 --> 00:26:40,207
Guest: now we kind of have to go in front of everybody and say this is an idea that we had.

452
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,075
Guest: you know we can make games.

453
00:26:42,255 --> 00:26:42,717
Guest: we did it.

454
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,426
Guest: you can go to the website and buy it.

455
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:45,713
Guest: give us some money.

456
00:26:45,733 --> 00:26:46,880
Guest: we'll make another one of course.

457
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:56,929
Rym: look how well that worked with like multiple Japanese game designers recent history who had a history of making good things and then just kind of struck out on their own for various reasons.

458
00:26:57,251 --> 00:26:58,418
Guest: yeah I couldn't imagine weird.

459
00:26:58,438 --> 00:26:59,965
Guest: it's like a bunch of news came out recently.

460
00:27:01,511 --> 00:27:01,873
Guest: anyway.

461
00:27:02,194 --> 00:27:10,872
Rym: yeah I was gonna talk about the news the revelations about all the game designers and composers who are literally being janitors for a certain game company.

462
00:27:10,952 --> 00:27:14,428
Scott: but I mean you know visual novels are hot lately right?

463
00:27:14,448 --> 00:27:16,620
Scott: you know I mean having a property to go along with.

464
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,404
Scott: it seems to help.

465
00:27:17,444 --> 00:27:20,278
Scott: but if you look on Steam it's like that long live.

466
00:27:20,298 --> 00:27:22,008
Scott: the Queen game seems to have done really well.

467
00:27:22,029 --> 00:27:24,864
Scott: I mean I bought that right and there was that in New Year's.

468
00:27:25,366 --> 00:27:26,230
Scott: yeah it's like.

469
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:34,845
Scott: you know there's definitely a market for any kind of visual novel regard in the US regardless of you know what's in it well and I think there's.

470
00:27:34,966 --> 00:27:38,323
Guest: there's actually the opportunity there I believe is is bigger than we expect.

471
00:27:38,343 --> 00:27:45,475
Guest: because I do think that the presentation the mode of presentation is accessible in a way that a lot of games maybe aren't.

472
00:27:45,555 --> 00:27:53,429
Guest: so even with bio where's efforts in Mass Effect 3 to allow you to bypass the action sequences and just get to the story?

473
00:27:53,469 --> 00:28:01,568
Guest: in the narrative you still had a lot of like let's face it relatively complicated controls for a certain set of users in a 3d space and in a 3d world.

474
00:28:01,789 --> 00:28:03,739
Guest: that was a barrier to entry to that narrative.

475
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:06,869
Guest: and you know the price and the price?

476
00:28:06,929 --> 00:28:07,471
Guest: yeah you know.

477
00:28:07,572 --> 00:28:12,832
Guest: obviously like we don't have like GameStop we don't have EA we have.

478
00:28:12,973 --> 00:28:16,211
Scott: we have significantly lower overhead and the equipment that you need to play it right.

479
00:28:16,231 --> 00:28:23,333
Scott: you need either some kind of new ish console or a PC that doesn't suck yeah or a good PC and in our case like you can play your games on just like your phone right?

480
00:28:23,353 --> 00:28:24,360
Guest: yeah yeah it's it's all.

481
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,124
Guest: it's all on the web.

482
00:28:25,164 --> 00:28:26,169
Guest: so it works with anything.

483
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:30,409
Guest: above Andrew our Android 4.0 you've got iOS 8 and above.

484
00:28:31,052 --> 00:28:34,651
Guest: you know I actually have a Chromebook for testing and iPads probably really good to play it on.

485
00:28:34,692 --> 00:28:35,618
Guest: right it is actually.

486
00:28:35,658 --> 00:28:36,502
Guest: it looks beautiful.

487
00:28:38,588 --> 00:28:40,493
Scott: level resolution graphics?

488
00:28:40,694 --> 00:28:49,748
Guest: yeah oh yeah definitely we we actually bake two sets of assets for anything in the game one for high DPI displays and one for well yeah very nice.

489
00:28:49,869 --> 00:28:57,411
Rym: so it's interesting is that it these like the visual novels in general like they got really big but it seems like the ones that are getting the most traction.

490
00:28:57,431 --> 00:28:59,262
Rym: that people talk like hot tuba boyfriend is example.

491
00:28:59,282 --> 00:29:07,939
Rym: it's like the the ones that are almost a joke but like I played through that game it's not actually a great game it's just a great concept like.

492
00:29:07,999 --> 00:29:12,777
Rym: it's funny to know that it exists but it's not actually that fun to read it.

493
00:29:13,178 --> 00:29:15,005
Guest: so I have to admit something.

494
00:29:15,467 --> 00:29:16,331
Guest: I haven't played it yet.

495
00:29:16,592 --> 00:29:19,102
Guest: yeah so I will say I played it like a minute.

496
00:29:19,162 --> 00:29:26,684
Guest: it just came out on Vita which improves its odds like by about a thousand because the only time I ever get to play games now is when I'm a train or a bus or something.

497
00:29:26,704 --> 00:29:27,870
Rym: wait you have a Vita.

498
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:33,348
Guest: yeah oh yeah I bought it to play danganronpa and persona for golden.

499
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,878
Guest: so obviously like those are those are.

500
00:29:36,701 --> 00:29:37,786
Guest: they're a little more gamey.

501
00:29:38,187 --> 00:29:41,520
Guest: persona for definitely danganronpa pretty much.

502
00:29:41,781 --> 00:29:43,350
Guest: they're a little more gamey let's say.

503
00:29:43,471 --> 00:29:47,631
Guest: but at the same time they present this really strong narrative in a format that's really familiar to us.

504
00:29:47,812 --> 00:29:58,955
Rym: so hmm yeah well I remember like when I even like Emily and a lot of people I really want to play Mass Effect and all these games because the stories and then I really when I see them play Mass Effect 1 I'm just waiting for the.

505
00:29:59,035 --> 00:29:59,799
Rym: oh this game sucks.

506
00:30:00,401 --> 00:30:01,264
Guest: Mass Effect 1 was bad.

507
00:30:01,465 --> 00:30:02,909
Guest: yeah I think ably bad.

508
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,594
Guest: yeah well I beat it.

509
00:30:04,614 --> 00:30:05,477
Guest: so I could not.

510
00:30:05,497 --> 00:30:07,144
Rym: I could not.

511
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:08,793
Rym: I did not care enough about that game.

512
00:30:08,834 --> 00:30:12,049
Rym: I just I realized I could just watch the story on YouTube and it's not even that long.

513
00:30:12,591 --> 00:30:20,827
Guest: yeah and and you know I think I don't think you're the only person to say that and so it's interesting because you're coming at this from and I will use this term here you're kind of a hardcore gamer.

514
00:30:21,149 --> 00:30:24,347
Guest: yeah you know you know what you're doing you know how to use game pretty good.

515
00:30:25,311 --> 00:30:27,702
Guest: so imagine coming at it from a completely different perspective.

516
00:30:27,722 --> 00:30:34,836
Rym: I guess what I don't like are games that have like a really hard game component like this thing and then completely orthogonal to that.

517
00:30:35,218 --> 00:30:35,981
Rym: here's the story.

518
00:30:36,022 --> 00:30:42,169
Rym: that will continue and if you care about one or the other then they don't really intersect at all.

519
00:30:42,631 --> 00:30:47,874
Guest: yeah and and personally I think one of the strengths of what we're doing is is that you we have shed a lot of that.

520
00:30:47,894 --> 00:30:52,052
Guest: that baggage I think is the way that I'll put it.

521
00:30:52,574 --> 00:30:56,050
Guest: I mean we all played Mass Effect 1. we all remember driving the Mako or the Mako.

522
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:58,441
Guest: that was not a fun part of that game.

523
00:30:58,742 --> 00:31:07,682
Rym: dice rolls for aiming and shooting in a third-person title please please of course I remember I even have life one like the vehicles weren't great actually.

524
00:31:07,702 --> 00:31:11,074
Scott: Half-Life 1 yeah I don't know.

525
00:31:11,114 --> 00:31:12,398
Scott: jeepathon was good time.

526
00:31:12,438 --> 00:31:13,522
Rym: jeepathon was good times.

527
00:31:13,583 --> 00:31:14,546
Rym: it was not good.

528
00:31:14,566 --> 00:31:17,538
Scott: so you're so you're dating out against.

529
00:31:17,558 --> 00:31:18,803
Scott: they're mostly sort of just.

530
00:31:18,824 --> 00:31:19,668
Scott: you know the straight-up.

531
00:31:19,728 --> 00:31:20,874
Scott: choose your own adventure path.

532
00:31:21,236 --> 00:31:24,173
Scott: you know there's not a lot of you know game going on at all.

533
00:31:24,515 --> 00:31:28,371
Scott: but I mean do you think you can do if you wanted like the more you know?

534
00:31:28,733 --> 00:31:30,520
Rym: simulation added to staff builder.

535
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:35,538
Scott: yeah like like Tokimeki like a Tokimeki right you got to go to school.

536
00:31:35,558 --> 00:31:36,462
Scott: do I study?

537
00:31:36,522 --> 00:31:38,474
Rym: I'm just gunning for another Tokimeki game.

538
00:31:38,735 --> 00:31:40,142
Scott: I can't read the ones that exist.

539
00:31:40,363 --> 00:31:41,067
Scott: I need something.

540
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:42,473
Guest: yeah there's.

541
00:31:42,513 --> 00:31:43,136
Guest: you know the.

542
00:31:43,196 --> 00:31:44,622
Guest: the system itself is very flexible.

543
00:31:45,184 --> 00:31:47,514
Guest: there's nothing stopping us from doing that.

544
00:31:47,835 --> 00:31:58,557
Guest: personally like I have spent my time in stat builders man I said I spent my time in the stat mines and so personally I I'm not as excited about that game mode.

545
00:31:58,898 --> 00:32:00,766
Guest: technically though there's nothing stopping us.

546
00:32:00,847 --> 00:32:10,915
Guest: and you know who knows if if a creator came to me and said I have this really great game it's a stat builder here here's the pitch and it was awesome I'd be like yeah definitely like.

547
00:32:11,055 --> 00:32:15,518
Guest: get on board let's let's build it but it's it's not something that I'm I would.

548
00:32:15,619 --> 00:32:16,563
Guest: I'm like fired up about.

549
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:27,875
Rym: I guess design and QA is a lot harder like a lot of those I've played but later most like a lot longer ago like not anytime recently like especially like Tokimeki's and things like those simple dating games.

550
00:32:28,418 --> 00:32:30,910
Rym: there's like it's just a threshold of.

551
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:32,900
Rym: did you get to a threshold to trigger this thing?

552
00:32:33,562 --> 00:32:37,233
Rym: so a lot of your decisions don't actually matter.

553
00:32:37,695 --> 00:32:40,466
Scott: I noticed that more with like long live the Queen.

554
00:32:40,506 --> 00:32:40,647
Scott: right.

555
00:32:40,687 --> 00:32:41,572
Scott: that's literally like.

556
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,707
Scott: did you get this stat up to this percent by this day?

557
00:32:44,828 --> 00:32:45,873
Scott: if so this happens.

558
00:32:45,954 --> 00:32:46,858
Scott: otherwise this happens.

559
00:32:46,878 --> 00:32:50,575
Scott: so it's really just to choose your own adventure where the choices are obscured.

560
00:32:51,057 --> 00:32:58,432
Scott: but Tokimeki like it was a PlayStation 1 game but I mean this might just be my SNES game I mean but it really blew up on the PlayStation.

561
00:32:58,532 --> 00:33:06,184
Scott: I remember the technology at least back then being so insane like it could read you know the text-to-speech of your name?

562
00:33:06,245 --> 00:33:08,216
Rym: oh yeah in a PlayStation 1 you type your name in.

563
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:11,671
Scott: I remember our name was right and it's just like.

564
00:33:11,711 --> 00:33:14,584
Scott: it seemed like it wasn't doing what long live the Queen.

565
00:33:14,624 --> 00:33:16,035
Scott: it even though it might have been under the hood.

566
00:33:16,096 --> 00:33:17,504
Scott: it seemed a lot more natural.

567
00:33:17,524 --> 00:33:20,014
Scott: you know in terms of like I went to school.

568
00:33:20,035 --> 00:33:28,638
Scott: you know it's like oh if you went to school more often then you would get better grades and you know the girl who cared about school would be more likely to go out with you.

569
00:33:28,699 --> 00:33:36,092
Scott: and as opposed to these things you know there were things that happen on specific days but there were so many days in the school year.

570
00:33:36,634 --> 00:33:41,423
Scott: you know as I think you know other games like think of it what long of the Queen's like 40 days long or something like that.

571
00:33:41,423 --> 00:33:42,449
Scott: 50 days and that's it.

572
00:33:42,972 --> 00:33:46,710
Scott: you know Tokimeki is three years of Japanese high school yeah plus summer.

573
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:50,085
Guest: if I remember though there was a random component to that game.

574
00:33:50,105 --> 00:33:53,102
Guest: you could choose to study but you maybe it wasn't a success.

575
00:33:53,143 --> 00:34:04,679
Scott: I remember very whenever you chose one of the things it would be like you know like you would show the drawing and then like a circle or X like you succeeded or failed and being at the will of a random number generator.

576
00:34:04,699 --> 00:34:10,291
Guest: man there's nothing that's gonna turn me off from a game more quickly but it's a holding my breath like oh did he study right?

577
00:34:10,311 --> 00:34:11,417
Guest: this time you didn't.

578
00:34:11,478 --> 00:34:12,281
Guest: you did it bad.

579
00:34:13,666 --> 00:34:26,636
Rym: but imagine the counterpoint of not the door fortress of if the more emergent the gameplay is like if if the randomness causes unintended or unexpected or at least unexpected to the player things to happen.

580
00:34:27,056 --> 00:34:27,781
Rym: then there's this.

581
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,431
Rym: it adds like this additional layer of discovery.

582
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:33,225
Rym: it's more like an evolving story then.

583
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:34,875
Rym: well I followed this path to the end.

584
00:34:34,915 --> 00:34:38,418
Rym: I'm gonna try to follow this other very specific path and see I'll totally get on board with that.

585
00:34:38,458 --> 00:34:44,685
Guest: but I think at least my experience when I played Toki memo on the SNES it was come on green hair girl come on.

586
00:34:44,866 --> 00:34:48,742
Rym: no I did track so bad that she doesn't like me anymore.

587
00:34:48,782 --> 00:34:50,411
Guest: how about you other green hair girl?

588
00:34:50,451 --> 00:34:52,763
Guest: you're in the library you want to go to the park.

589
00:34:53,005 --> 00:34:53,467
Guest: she didn't?

590
00:34:53,547 --> 00:34:54,735
Guest: she did not want to go to the park.

591
00:34:54,755 --> 00:34:57,288
Scott: better restart the game better restart.

592
00:34:58,071 --> 00:34:58,393
Guest: so when?

593
00:34:58,493 --> 00:35:01,025
Guest: when you talk about like emergent behavior like that I love that.

594
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:04,260
Guest: but the failure state for me and Toki memo was kind of like.

595
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,247
Guest: well I'm sitting alone.

596
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,248
Rym: well I've been thinking about this a lot partly cuz that far future games pan like.

597
00:35:08,309 --> 00:35:12,959
Rym: I found the slides from when I did a similar thing at magfest and also we had all those panels up to our fortress.

598
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:13,462
Rym: and there's like.

599
00:35:13,723 --> 00:35:25,132
Rym: there's this critical mass like this threshold where there's enough emergent behavior and bushiness to where it feels like discovery and the randomness feels like the effectively infinite content.

600
00:35:25,614 --> 00:35:32,904
Rym: but anything less than that feels like the game just fucked you and anything more than that feels like actual dwarf fortress.

601
00:35:33,828 --> 00:35:34,852
Guest: you can lean into it too.

602
00:35:34,912 --> 00:35:42,822
Guest: so Joe actually her one of her first games was a game jam game for a Valentine's Day and it was essentially you were.

603
00:35:42,943 --> 00:35:50,417
Guest: you paired up with with literally random women at a bar who had literally random backstories and said literally random things.

604
00:35:50,437 --> 00:35:56,156
Guest: when you broke up and some of the some of the dialogue we got out of that was heartbreaking.

605
00:35:56,176 --> 00:35:57,963
Scott: so how did so?

606
00:35:58,003 --> 00:35:58,647
Scott: did you wait?

607
00:35:58,727 --> 00:36:01,241
Scott: it was literally like you didn't fill a database with text.

608
00:36:01,302 --> 00:36:05,622
Guest: well we randomly choose yeah we filled the database with database with text.

609
00:36:05,662 --> 00:36:08,920
Rym: I guess she's not saying like I can pick fuck question exclamation point.

610
00:36:09,704 --> 00:36:10,770
Guest: no no but it would it would.

611
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:11,051
Guest: you know?

612
00:36:11,152 --> 00:36:12,882
Guest: you would end up being paired with a woman.

613
00:36:12,902 --> 00:36:18,915
Guest: you would meet a woman at a bar who turned out to be like a puff of smoke and then the breakup line was she's gone like the wind.

614
00:36:18,935 --> 00:36:21,705
Guest: it's just like that was random but at the same time.

615
00:36:24,153 --> 00:36:26,099
Rym: so I noticed this like a few months ago.

616
00:36:26,179 --> 00:36:26,802
Rym: but explodes.

617
00:36:26,822 --> 00:36:28,109
Rym: them actually sign on happiness.

618
00:36:28,672 --> 00:36:29,477
Rym: they have a random.

619
00:36:29,497 --> 00:36:33,014
Rym: like you know every webcomic has a random comic right like click for a random one.

620
00:36:33,677 --> 00:36:37,490
Rym: theirs actually generates a random comic three panels.

621
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:40,038
Rym: it is almost nothing but comedy gold.

622
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:40,921
Guest: does it?

623
00:36:40,961 --> 00:36:42,147
Guest: does it do that from transcripts?

624
00:36:42,609 --> 00:36:47,854
Rym: well basically he looks like he made like thousands of individual panels and he just picks three of them.

625
00:36:48,617 --> 00:36:49,180
Guest: oh all right.

626
00:36:49,682 --> 00:36:51,532
Rym: yeah I love that and it seeds it.

627
00:36:51,552 --> 00:36:55,291
Rym: so you can actually go find one that you found before if it was actually like particularly know where they.

628
00:36:55,431 --> 00:36:58,934
Scott: hmm yeah that does seem to be a thing about visual novels.

629
00:36:58,954 --> 00:37:02,613
Scott: is that you know if you have the randomness the failure state does suck.

630
00:37:02,633 --> 00:37:05,525
Scott: cuz it's like I spent a lot of time on this and got nowhere.

631
00:37:06,128 --> 00:37:08,318
Scott: but you lose like the replay value.

632
00:37:08,418 --> 00:37:11,397
Scott: right like if I play a date night Oh game and I see every ending I'm sort of done.

633
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:14,972
Scott: well if you read a book sure I guess that's the case.

634
00:37:15,093 --> 00:37:16,980
Rym: yes I was thinking about this a lot.

635
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:17,382
Rym: they're like this.

636
00:37:17,543 --> 00:37:23,213
Rym: they're like this middle ground between just a book and like just a simulator like a door fortress.

637
00:37:23,414 --> 00:37:25,003
Scott: you can't end you can always play it again.

638
00:37:25,545 --> 00:37:27,093
Scott: well it's kind of you can play one time.

639
00:37:27,113 --> 00:37:29,768
Guest: yeah I mean yes you're you're absolutely right you know.

640
00:37:29,788 --> 00:37:37,605
Guest: and in the same way that some games well I think attempt to provide value by banking on the RNG and giving you this emergent gameplay.

641
00:37:37,967 --> 00:37:45,216
Guest: our games bank on the fact that there's a lot of words and pretty pictures and you're gonna look at them all at least I hope you do so.

642
00:37:45,236 --> 00:37:51,127
Guest: you know the so the so there's that I man.

643
00:37:51,167 --> 00:37:56,327
Rym: well think about the RNG like a game like FTL faster than light leans on that like that's the game.

644
00:37:56,347 --> 00:38:00,825
Rym: yeah and you get these like the end always sucks when you lose and usually you lose.

645
00:38:01,347 --> 00:38:06,428
Rym: but I definitely always because it's heavy on the gameplay the emergent stuff.

646
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:09,019
Rym: it doesn't feel unsatisfying to die.

647
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:14,085
Rym: but if you're playing a dating game and the emerge their RNG is just yeah no girls date you.

648
00:38:14,145 --> 00:38:15,594
Rym: that just feels really unsatisfying.

649
00:38:15,634 --> 00:38:20,483
Rym: it's not like there's a thousand different shadow gateways that you physically die because they didn't date you.

650
00:38:20,563 --> 00:38:22,011
Rym: then maybe it'd be interesting again.

651
00:38:22,031 --> 00:38:25,420
Guest: yeah wait I want to make this game like shadow shadow date.

652
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,990
Rym: I would play the

653
00:38:29,631 --> 00:38:30,252
Scott: hell out of that

654
00:38:30,333 --> 00:38:34,662
Guest: smoking tinder torch

655
00:38:34,823 --> 00:38:35,083
Scott: torch.

656
00:38:35,123 --> 00:38:36,727
Scott: we go on girl.

657
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:38,370
Guest: no no no don't do that.

658
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:39,452
Guest: this race is coming on to you.

659
00:38:39,492 --> 00:38:40,675
Guest: wait hold up you're winning me over.

660
00:38:40,695 --> 00:38:49,832
Rym: so is that Zeno technically?

661
00:38:49,992 --> 00:38:52,618
Rym: or is that what is that ashy?

662
00:38:55,324 --> 00:39:07,635
Rym: so what is it like on a like personal level having like for real founded a game studio because the one thing Scott I have never done is actually given up on our day jobs to go after the things we care about.

663
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:13,961
Scott: like I say I'm so risk-averse like I still work for rich people I would totally do that.

664
00:39:13,981 --> 00:39:17,156
Scott: you know many ideas I have but I am very afraid of being homeless.

665
00:39:17,538 --> 00:39:18,583
Scott: so it's not a thing that I do.

666
00:39:18,603 --> 00:39:20,372
Guest: well it's it's interesting.

667
00:39:20,432 --> 00:39:25,451
Guest: so towards the end of my college career I went to a. I promise this is relevant.

668
00:39:25,672 --> 00:39:26,113
Guest: I went to.

669
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:27,276
Rym: I went to a private school.

670
00:39:27,296 --> 00:39:34,076
Guest: my family's financial situation changed.

671
00:39:34,277 --> 00:39:37,215
Guest: I basically got kicked out because I didn't have enough money and to stay in school.

672
00:39:37,476 --> 00:39:39,908
Guest: I subsidize that by doing freelance web development.

673
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:41,741
Guest: so I've been doing freelance web development.

674
00:39:41,761 --> 00:39:47,212
Guest: so I was like yeah like 21 or 22 and then after I graduated I had all these professional contacts from doing it.

675
00:39:47,273 --> 00:39:50,453
Scott: so I could you also like work at AMD and stuff because you were way smarter than me.

676
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:53,650
Guest: well yeah I did an internship there and I did pretty okay.

677
00:39:53,851 --> 00:40:03,354
Guest: but you know I once I graduated while a lot of people were getting these like w-2 yearly salaries I just kept doing freelance because I had all these professional contacts.

678
00:40:03,575 --> 00:40:14,804
Guest: so I got very used to this like invoice payment invoice payment cycle and feast and famine and it's sort of normalized risk for me in a way that I don't think it was normalized for a lot of people.

679
00:40:15,467 --> 00:40:30,373
Guest: so for me transitioning from my previous job which was like a normal w-2 salary position to date night oh which is you know it turns out owning a company and having a company is very different than being a freelancer because you don't get to invoice anybody.

680
00:40:32,178 --> 00:40:39,563
Guest: it is it is scary sometimes you know and and our co-founder Lindsay Woods of course is a full-time employee.

681
00:40:39,643 --> 00:40:43,722
Guest: so you know instead of you know just invoicing people I'm actually cutting paychecks.

682
00:40:44,546 --> 00:40:51,071
Guest: you're being invoiced yeah being actively invoiced and you know Joe Joe of course and Mike was on board.

683
00:40:51,512 --> 00:40:57,050
Guest: so these you know all of these things are happening and it's scary.

684
00:40:57,070 --> 00:41:00,425
Guest: but at the same time I think I'm well suited to it like to me.

685
00:41:00,445 --> 00:41:16,221
Guest: it's very exciting and and you guys have known me for a while you know that I've got that unfortunate personality situation where it's like I will invest like a hundred hours a week into something just because I didn't like the way this worked or because this needed to be just a little better before it launched.

686
00:41:16,642 --> 00:41:23,892
Guest: so the the confluence and the nexus of those two things I think were really really beneficial to me in that regard.

687
00:41:25,559 --> 00:41:27,166
Guest: it's been it's been nothing but a blast for me.

688
00:41:27,749 --> 00:41:29,035
Rym: so how about specifically doing it?

689
00:41:29,597 --> 00:41:32,631
Rym: is being in New York City a net positive or a net negative?

690
00:41:32,651 --> 00:41:33,374
Rym: in regard to this?

691
00:41:34,478 --> 00:41:37,329
Guest: this has been somewhat of a topic of discussion

692
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:37,630
Rym: because

693
00:41:37,992 --> 00:41:44,157
Scott: I it's expensive but there's so much people's here and talents and monies but also costing monies

694
00:41:44,378 --> 00:42:01,057
Guest: you hit the nail right on the head is the the nexus of talent that's present in the immediate vicinity the a 10-mile radius that I can bike to like like at the drop of a hat the fact that I could literally say to Hamlet Machine of Starfighter hey well I'm gonna come up there we're gonna work tonight I'll just crash with you.

695
00:42:01,419 --> 00:42:02,485
Guest: that's cool that's fine.

696
00:42:02,545 --> 00:42:05,982
Guest: it wasn't like a big deal it wasn't this this big investment of time?

697
00:42:06,243 --> 00:42:10,778
Guest: when Lindsay Woods quit her job I was like hey just come work for me instead.

698
00:42:10,898 --> 00:42:16,339
Rym: like other than Joe everyone on that far future of gaming panel lives here.

699
00:42:16,359 --> 00:42:18,248
Guest: yeah yeah and you know we're.

700
00:42:18,268 --> 00:42:21,081
Guest: you know that that situation might be changing too.

701
00:42:21,262 --> 00:42:24,837
Guest: and so yeah this is the the nexus of talent present in New York.

702
00:42:25,158 --> 00:42:29,697
Guest: I. it's something I've been balancing very carefully recently.

703
00:42:29,798 --> 00:42:38,672
Guest: at this time I think it's fair to say that there is value in being in New York out stripping that of the kind of incredible cost of real estate.

704
00:42:38,692 --> 00:42:40,075
Guest: prices aren't going down here y'all.

705
00:42:40,196 --> 00:42:47,640
Rym: we're in some of the few remaining rent stabilized buildings here.

706
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:50,494
Guest: yeah I just spent the last three weeks in Northern Virginia.

707
00:42:50,795 --> 00:42:53,023
Guest: so yeah yeah and it was.

708
00:42:53,184 --> 00:42:53,967
Guest: it was gorgeous.

709
00:42:54,027 --> 00:42:54,850
Guest: like I won't play.

710
00:42:54,930 --> 00:43:00,577
Guest: it was gorgeous but uh but at the moment I think it's it's safe to say that New York is is our home.

711
00:43:00,637 --> 00:43:03,897
Guest: this is where we were founded this is where our core is and it's it's where we're gonna be.

712
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:05,347
Rym: cuz I ran into something interesting.

713
00:43:05,387 --> 00:43:08,044
Rym: so I went to a the kind of party that I'm usually not invited to.

714
00:43:08,064 --> 00:43:16,359
Rym: so I was basically at an event with like all the VCS like the investors like the top of that food chain and they were doing presentations.

715
00:43:16,379 --> 00:43:17,103
Rym: there's all this stuff.

716
00:43:17,143 --> 00:43:19,214
Scott: and what one percent evil people.

717
00:43:19,495 --> 00:43:22,529
Rym: yeah some of them might be listening you never know.

718
00:43:22,549 --> 00:43:34,026
Rym: but well just say that I was in one of these events and what I learned is that they look at New York as a place to start a company because all the smart people are here but they want the company to move to California.

719
00:43:34,086 --> 00:43:40,012
Rym: when they then want to pump it up get more investment and flip it wait it's obviously not for cost saving.

720
00:43:40,655 --> 00:43:42,504
Rym: it is actually in their perspective.

721
00:43:42,524 --> 00:43:47,190
Rym: they want to be out there because that's what they get more investment because salaries are lower.

722
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:48,258
Rym: there's this they like.

723
00:43:48,298 --> 00:44:01,770
Rym: we used to always say and Dean as we had this perception that the difference between an East Coast and a West Coast startup is that in the East Coast I'll work for a startup if they pay me money but on the West Coast people will work for basically dreams and lottery tickets.

724
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:10,858
Rym: equity yeah and the talented people in New York are a lot more like business oriented in terms of let's make the thing.

725
00:44:11,601 --> 00:44:16,021
Rym: so it seems like those people are actually better at getting things working quickly.

726
00:44:16,685 --> 00:44:25,506
Rym: but when they want to expand the company they can pay a lot of people in lottery tickets and actually cost a lot less money to like triple your headcount on the West Coast.

727
00:44:26,309 --> 00:44:29,105
Rym: because a lot of those people are kind of semi independently wealthy.

728
00:44:29,165 --> 00:44:32,183
Rym: they have money from the last company that was a lottery ticket.

729
00:44:32,223 --> 00:44:32,666
Rym: there there's.

730
00:44:33,129 --> 00:44:36,791
Rym: it was just a weird conversation to be having with all these really really really rich people.

731
00:44:38,116 --> 00:44:39,541
Scott: if they're so rich why aren't they on the beach?

732
00:44:40,906 --> 00:44:46,133
Rym: yeah as soon as I have enough money to be on the beach I'm either on the beach or making my own game studio.

733
00:44:46,153 --> 00:44:51,015
Guest: yeah hey if they're looking for investment opportunities man do I have some good news for them?

734
00:44:53,201 --> 00:44:57,496
Guest: that does surprise me I won't lie although I guess I shouldn't be that surprised.

735
00:44:57,597 --> 00:45:00,775
Guest: I've been kind of putting the feelers out for engineers out here.

736
00:45:00,795 --> 00:45:03,046
Guest: engineers out here are relatively hard to hire.

737
00:45:03,086 --> 00:45:04,835
Guest: that is has been my experience.

738
00:45:04,916 --> 00:45:13,852
Rym: oh everything's hard to hire like I. recruiters talk to me like direct and I basically tell him I work four days a week and you have to pay me a lot of money.

739
00:45:13,873 --> 00:45:14,354
Scott: how's that sound?

740
00:45:14,635 --> 00:45:15,980
Guest: yeah see welcome to New York.

741
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:20,075
Guest: yeah but that's that's fair.

742
00:45:20,195 --> 00:45:20,477
Guest: I don't.

743
00:45:20,577 --> 00:45:25,080
Guest: I don't know where what our future holds in that regard at the moment but well there is.

744
00:45:25,161 --> 00:45:25,945
Rym: Emily told me about it.

745
00:45:26,006 --> 00:45:40,204
Rym: apparently there is a move for New York City might be the state - I'm not sure I could ask Emily about it but there might be a big like tax credit thing coming just for small semi-independent video game studios in New York.

746
00:45:40,244 --> 00:45:41,028
Scott: yeah but how about that?

747
00:45:41,129 --> 00:45:43,804
Scott: that startup NYC thing was bullshit so why would this not be?

748
00:45:43,945 --> 00:45:47,222
Guest: it was super bullshit by the way definitely bullshit right.

749
00:45:47,343 --> 00:45:48,669
Scott: so why wouldn't this also be bullshit?

750
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:50,399
Scott: you never know you never know.

751
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:51,566
Rym: I didn't write Emily told me about.

752
00:45:51,586 --> 00:45:53,434
Rym: I have not yet done any investigation into it.

753
00:45:53,454 --> 00:46:00,964
Guest: hmm yeah given given Albany oh man I'm from upstate New York so like let me get super mad right now.

754
00:46:01,004 --> 00:46:05,407
Guest: but yeah when it comes to Albany in New York State tax code it's just like all bets are off.

755
00:46:05,508 --> 00:46:06,453
Guest: that shit is out the window.

756
00:46:06,473 --> 00:46:08,020
Rym: the worst thing is our bar best.

757
00:46:08,301 --> 00:46:13,249
Rym: our last best hope for peace was Zephyr Teachout and now she's running that super PAC instead.

758
00:46:13,269 --> 00:46:14,576
Rym: I don't think she's gonna run for governor again.

759
00:46:14,596 --> 00:46:15,521
Scott: I don't think so anything.

760
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,033
Guest: oh well well that will do.

761
00:46:18,194 --> 00:46:20,963
Guest: that will make me leave New York.

762
00:46:21,164 --> 00:46:23,030
Scott: let's talk about other games.

763
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:24,576
Rym: yeah what have you been playing lately?

764
00:46:24,596 --> 00:46:27,408
Rym: anything well you played anything.

765
00:46:27,428 --> 00:46:30,901
Guest: I well I did just beat danganronpa one and two all right.

766
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:33,472
Guest: so I mentioned this right have you got?

767
00:46:33,492 --> 00:46:34,782
Guest: are you guys familiar with this game at all?

768
00:46:34,862 --> 00:46:37,398
Scott: it's a title that I've heard of but I've never played it.

769
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:43,735
Rym: yeah that that whole like the same thing with persona like those are games that I know about primarily from let's play is making fun of them.

770
00:46:43,937 --> 00:46:46,071
Scott: I know the names of them and I know sort of what they look like.

771
00:46:46,612 --> 00:46:52,551
Guest: I hate to be that that pitch guy who says oh it's like uber meets fresh direct.

772
00:46:54,296 --> 00:46:57,243
Guest: it is kind of like battle royale meets Phoenix Wright.

773
00:46:58,407 --> 00:47:01,579
Guest: so it's a Phoenix Wright high school murder simulator.

774
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:06,422
Guest: with this most importantly it's got this incredibly bold visual style that how does it play?

775
00:47:06,442 --> 00:47:09,173
Scott: does it play like like like a 999?

776
00:47:09,173 --> 00:47:14,857
Guest: it actually plays more like a Phoenix right the yeah the the parallels actually go pretty deep.

777
00:47:15,038 --> 00:47:20,124
Guest: so there are murders and there are investigations and there are trials and the.

778
00:47:20,204 --> 00:47:23,741
Guest: there are actually more gamified elements in the trials than a Phoenix Wright.

779
00:47:24,545 --> 00:47:26,414
Guest: the first game I thought was significantly tighter.

780
00:47:26,494 --> 00:47:29,530
Scott: in this regard I have to do like a rhythm based objection.

781
00:47:31,274 --> 00:47:32,697
Guest: you are 100% correct.

782
00:47:32,757 --> 00:47:35,242
Guest: yes you do.

783
00:47:35,282 --> 00:47:36,866
Guest: that is that is absolutely correct.

784
00:47:37,908 --> 00:47:46,103
Guest: and and the you know my favorite of the mini games is the one where you have to drag comic panels into an incomplete comic to create the murder.

785
00:47:46,484 --> 00:47:48,553
Scott: that's actually pretty interesting.

786
00:47:48,593 --> 00:47:51,049
Guest: yeah yeah I thought the first game did a way better job like.

787
00:47:51,129 --> 00:47:54,170
Scott: it makes it still makes sense and you put it in the other orders but it's wrong.

788
00:47:54,472 --> 00:47:55,337
Guest: yeah yeah it'll.

789
00:47:55,417 --> 00:47:58,514
Guest: well it might not make sense so you could just put the wrong tile in the wrong space.

790
00:47:58,534 --> 00:48:02,413
Scott: yeah but you know it's not trivially easy if you're not cheating.

791
00:48:02,433 --> 00:48:04,609
Rym: Wow resurrection knife this isn't even a.

792
00:48:12,697 --> 00:48:14,384
Guest: but you know I really I love this style.

793
00:48:14,444 --> 00:48:16,071
Guest: the story of the first game really got me.

794
00:48:16,333 --> 00:48:18,022
Guest: I'm still like chewing through the second one.

795
00:48:18,042 --> 00:48:21,398
Guest: I will say that a lot of people I know really loved it.

796
00:48:21,519 --> 00:48:22,523
Guest: I'm still working on it.

797
00:48:22,985 --> 00:48:26,122
Guest: well you know I finished it but like I'm still kind of integrating it.

798
00:48:26,183 --> 00:48:27,731
Guest: so we'll see how I end up on that one.

799
00:48:27,751 --> 00:48:29,697
Rym: is that it?

800
00:48:29,737 --> 00:48:30,600
Rym: that's you that's your games.

801
00:48:31,142 --> 00:48:32,606
Guest: yeah I beat persona.

802
00:48:33,048 --> 00:48:38,188
Guest: I dabbled in Final Fantasy 14 briefly because there's an online one.

803
00:48:38,208 --> 00:48:43,411
Guest: yeah yeah there was this kind of like resurgence and I had this hot cat boy named cat face.

804
00:48:43,471 --> 00:48:45,442
Guest: yammer I mean yeah right like.

805
00:48:45,462 --> 00:48:49,320
Guest: come on I had the opportunity to be a hot cat boy so that that was.

806
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:54,099
Guest: that was there for a bit but I I don't think I have the time right now to do MMOs.

807
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:55,344
Guest: it turns out big surprise.

808
00:48:55,926 --> 00:48:59,066
Rym: yeah I think is I have almost invented free time and I would have time for MMOs.

809
00:48:59,086 --> 00:49:01,276
Rym: like I learned my lesson with the realm in 1997. man I played.

810
00:49:01,356 --> 00:49:12,986
Scott: I played more World of Warcraft than I probably should have back in college I'll say thankful to the muds of the 90s for protecting me from the 3d muds of the 2000s.

811
00:49:13,006 --> 00:49:14,556
Rym: now you didn't get your immunization.

812
00:49:14,596 --> 00:49:15,301
Rym: that's your problem.

813
00:49:15,381 --> 00:49:16,408
Guest: yeah that's true that's right.

814
00:49:16,429 --> 00:49:17,354
Rym: I saw World of Warcraft.

815
00:49:17,374 --> 00:49:19,645
Rym: I'm like ah I've been there.

816
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:21,553
Guest: done that you guys are a little older than me right?

817
00:49:21,574 --> 00:49:23,320
Scott: no I saw a picture of you the other day.

818
00:49:23,341 --> 00:49:31,058
Rym: I was cleaning up my like photos and I have a picture of you from back in the air like an RIT like standing in the front of the anime club.

819
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:32,865
Rym: you look like you're like six.

820
00:49:33,909 --> 00:49:35,459
Scott: is he wearing an orange safety cone?

821
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:36,002
Scott: you were.

822
00:49:36,042 --> 00:49:37,129
Rym: yeah that was the orange safety code.

823
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:38,517
Scott: I was wearing a Naruto costume.

824
00:49:38,738 --> 00:49:39,582
Rym: yep that was.

825
00:49:39,603 --> 00:49:40,266
Rym: that was that day.

826
00:49:40,407 --> 00:49:43,323
Guest: still one of my proudest stage moments man thank you.

827
00:49:43,343 --> 00:49:44,952
Guest: thank you for bringing that apparently alrighty.

828
00:49:45,013 --> 00:49:49,478
Scott: anime is still going strong too like I read yeah we saw those people at ConnectiCon and also anime Boston.

829
00:49:49,538 --> 00:49:54,704
Scott: so whoa hey well not not the old people from back in the day like the current RIT anime club came.

830
00:49:54,986 --> 00:49:58,438
Rym: there's a little like there's weird like genetic memory of us.

831
00:50:00,343 --> 00:50:01,627
Guest: that's that's amazing man.

832
00:50:01,928 --> 00:50:03,837
Guest: so you guys asked me what games I'm playing.

833
00:50:04,118 --> 00:50:04,540
Guest: I gave you.

834
00:50:04,681 --> 00:50:05,606
Guest: I gave you the good answer.

835
00:50:05,627 --> 00:50:07,296
Guest: now I have to give you the bad answer.

836
00:50:07,638 --> 00:50:09,447
Guest: oh alright so this one's a two-parter.

837
00:50:09,729 --> 00:50:10,553
Guest: okay I'm really sorry.

838
00:50:11,958 --> 00:50:13,785
Guest: fruits of gracias came out on steam.

839
00:50:14,087 --> 00:50:14,789
Scott: I don't know what that is.

840
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:18,299
Guest: oh man Scott I have good news for you.

841
00:50:19,662 --> 00:50:24,276
Guest: it is a half a million word visual novel that was initially a.

842
00:50:24,296 --> 00:50:27,809
Scott: I guess I don't have to worry about the replay value.

843
00:50:27,829 --> 00:50:33,851
Rym: I tell fruits and it recommended that immediately before I typed of what's it about.

844
00:50:33,931 --> 00:50:45,936
Guest: so you play as the worst person in the world who rolls into this town and is obviously connected somehow with like the Japanese military and you're immediately arrested.

845
00:50:46,057 --> 00:50:49,214
Guest: and then you are sent to this school where there are only four other.

846
00:50:49,515 --> 00:50:53,392
Guest: you have four classmates all of whom are romance options and a principal.

847
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:56,183
Rym: wait there's five girls on the corny or not?

848
00:50:56,444 --> 00:50:57,347
Guest: oh it's super.

849
00:50:57,368 --> 00:50:58,573
Guest: well not the steam version.

850
00:50:58,654 --> 00:50:59,277
Guest: oh is it five?

851
00:50:59,318 --> 00:51:00,122
Guest: did I get the number wrong?

852
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:00,726
Guest: it is five.

853
00:51:00,987 --> 00:51:05,791
Rym: I say yeah this is an adult visual novel it is super adult but it has that many words in it.

854
00:51:06,153 --> 00:51:07,640
Guest: yeah yeah well it is.

855
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:08,766
Guest: I mean I don't know.

856
00:51:08,786 --> 00:51:09,991
Guest: are you familiar with love love?

857
00:51:10,613 --> 00:51:12,782
Rym: no wait this many words.

858
00:51:12,982 --> 00:51:14,689
Rym: listen I feel like this is gonna be so.

859
00:51:14,709 --> 00:51:17,304
Scott: apparently you've done a. being a creator of visual novels.

860
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:21,623
Scott: you seem to have done a lot of research on what is available out there.

861
00:51:21,643 --> 00:51:28,671
Guest: let me give it just an actual shout out right now to the writer of hustle cad Casey Van Hise for digging in to mov love.

862
00:51:29,033 --> 00:51:32,387
Guest: she got further in that game that I thought humanly possible.

863
00:51:32,648 --> 00:51:43,279
Guest: but if you like this the creator of attack on Titan actually went out of his way to say like hey I really I really loved mov love like it was a lot of that in that scenario that I really enjoyed.

864
00:51:43,299 --> 00:51:51,446
Scott: if you were not playing that and learning to draw better that would be because of it works for the body horror thing.

865
00:51:51,766 --> 00:51:55,341
Rym: but so my character design is some body horror here.

866
00:51:55,361 --> 00:51:57,854
Guest: oh man the mov love character designs are rough.

867
00:51:57,894 --> 00:52:02,354
Rym: let me tell you that reminds me of old savor marionette Jay crossed with like.

868
00:52:02,937 --> 00:52:04,282
Rym: I don't know MK are.

869
00:52:04,302 --> 00:52:11,505
Scott: I do always like the hairs that come forward like where there should be sideburns but they're long because she looks like that Tokimeki girl the one that you always know.

870
00:52:11,565 --> 00:52:12,230
Scott: I always like that.

871
00:52:13,252 --> 00:52:23,248
Guest: so so this game starts off as a normal high school romance simulator and it's a normal visual novel and there's two romance or five or four romance translated these things no one with hundreds of thousands of words.

872
00:52:23,288 --> 00:52:24,877
Guest: this is the one with hundreds of thousands of words.

873
00:52:25,078 --> 00:52:28,396
Guest: also this one also has it and this was a fan translation.

874
00:52:28,477 --> 00:52:42,533
Guest: so you you play this normal high school romance and then you beat it with these two romance options and then the game restarts into this ruined world where you're a mech pilot and all the women have to wear suits to show their boobies off and by that I mean there's glass panes on their boobies.

875
00:52:42,814 --> 00:52:44,584
Scott: well I didn't have the booby part.

876
00:52:44,644 --> 00:52:47,359
Scott: I definitely want to play the game where the world is ruined and you're a mech pilot.

877
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,996
Guest: okay well so yeah no me too for what it's worth.

878
00:52:50,057 --> 00:52:51,508
Guest: we were like okay we just have to get through.

879
00:52:51,528 --> 00:52:52,211
Guest: it's called movlev.

880
00:52:52,292 --> 00:53:05,478
Guest: extra is the opening sequence and the movlev alternative the back half ruined world part and we were actually kind of excited about this because we were all reading attack on Titan at the time and Hajime Isayama was like yeah you know this was kind of an.

881
00:53:05,659 --> 00:53:08,618
Guest: I don't know if he said inspiration but he definitely mentioned the ruined world.

882
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:09,745
Guest: okay yeah yeah.

883
00:53:09,785 --> 00:53:12,297
Guest: and so we were like yeah okay and then we started playing.

884
00:53:12,338 --> 00:53:16,412
Guest: it is like oh actually part of what Hajime Isayama?

885
00:53:16,532 --> 00:53:17,014
Guest: Is that his name?

886
00:53:17,074 --> 00:53:17,998
Guest: I might be screwing his name up.

887
00:53:18,018 --> 00:53:18,259
Scott: I'm so sorry.

888
00:53:18,279 --> 00:53:35,353
Guest: so part of what I think he took away from this was the intense jingoism and and like remilitarization of Japan and like you got it got mega uncomfortable in there for a second because this actually we were playing this right about the time when Mr.

889
00:53:35,393 --> 00:53:38,205
Guest: Isayama took all that heat for saying that stuff about Korea.

890
00:53:38,305 --> 00:53:48,116
Scott: yeah yeah so I mean aren't the otaku's who play these things in Japan usually also military fanboys?

891
00:53:48,317 --> 00:53:48,739
Scott: so isn't it?

892
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,349
Scott: just like you know that's the audience.

893
00:53:50,429 --> 00:53:53,257
Guest: I mean there is a show now where young girls turn into battleships.

894
00:53:53,538 --> 00:53:54,580
Guest: so it's not.

895
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:58,571
Guest: no I didn't.

896
00:53:58,592 --> 00:54:01,949
Scott: you see the airplane one - no yeah there's plenty of these things.

897
00:54:01,969 --> 00:54:03,800
Guest: I wanted to believe this was a new phenomenon.

898
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:07,360
Scott: I mean I guess it's new relative to the history of the universe.

899
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:08,969
Rym: I don't know what the first one was.

900
00:54:09,311 --> 00:54:09,894
Scott: that's a good quote.

901
00:54:09,914 --> 00:54:10,497
Scott: katsu would know.

902
00:54:10,617 --> 00:54:11,723
Rym: katsu would know.

903
00:54:12,085 --> 00:54:13,029
Guest: so this is mov love.

904
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:16,430
Guest: and then the game I'm playing is fruits of Grisaia which smells weirdly like it.

905
00:54:17,192 --> 00:54:17,534
Guest: it's been.

906
00:54:17,634 --> 00:54:18,678
Guest: it's been rough guys.

907
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:23,775
Guest: I okay more more GeekNights exclusive some some deep insider tips.

908
00:54:24,116 --> 00:54:33,532
Guest: I run a Twitter by the handle fuck game tweets and I started taking screenshots of this game and putting them next to the steam review quotes.

909
00:54:33,933 --> 00:54:39,088
Rym: so my uh my one small anecdote is way back.

910
00:54:39,168 --> 00:54:41,537
Rym: I was with a bunch of like business contact people in.

911
00:54:41,999 --> 00:54:48,268
Rym: I was in Singapore at the time at a party on the roof of a fancy hotel and we're hanging out and people talking.

912
00:54:48,549 --> 00:54:49,961
Rym: no one gives a shit about the finance stuff.

913
00:54:49,981 --> 00:54:55,354
Rym: they're all asking about the video game stuff like oh my god you go to PAX like ah and we start talking about a pecs - look how much money you have.

914
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:59,336
Rym: yeah go well but I was like you lecture packs get me a job in the game industry.

915
00:54:59,357 --> 00:55:01,145
Rym: I hate Wall Street like that's.

916
00:55:01,687 --> 00:55:10,507
Rym: you have so much money like making visual novels and there's a beat where I always pause because I expect these people to be like what's a visual novel.

917
00:55:10,567 --> 00:55:12,457
Rym: and I'm like already know what I'm gonna say.

918
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:16,538
Rym: and the guy I'm talking to without skipping a beat doesn't say what's a visual novel.

919
00:55:16,558 --> 00:55:18,550
Rym: he says oh those Asian fuck games cool.

920
00:55:19,671 --> 00:55:22,181
Guest: and he was right about our first title.

921
00:55:22,442 --> 00:55:25,313
Guest: those boys in space are definitely just cramming.

922
00:55:25,514 --> 00:55:43,043
Rym: you know I like Starfighter but also I'm not just gonna say that relationship is not a hundred percent healthy like there's a little bit every every sexual encounter in Starfighter Eclipse is overtly consensual and we actually made sure of this in a copy editing pass.

923
00:55:43,104 --> 00:55:44,874
Guest: this was part of our copy editing process.

924
00:55:44,994 --> 00:55:50,282
Guest: yeah it was to make sure that every sexual encounter was explicitly consensual and I was just saying that.

925
00:55:50,865 --> 00:55:51,549
Scott: I'm guessing that's.

926
00:55:51,629 --> 00:55:52,754
Scott: are you saying that it's not the case?

927
00:55:52,794 --> 00:55:53,456
Scott: in love?

928
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:56,427
Guest: I didn't play enough love love in.

929
00:55:56,648 --> 00:56:03,772
Guest: in there is at least a character that would definitely get you put into big-boy jail romancing.

930
00:56:04,034 --> 00:56:06,451
Scott: I mean I wasn't gonna play this but now I'm double not gonna play this.

931
00:56:06,511 --> 00:56:08,020
Guest: yeah no I had that problem.

932
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:11,458
Guest: I played this overdrive game called the Edelweiss and I basically beat this game.

933
00:56:11,498 --> 00:56:16,523
Guest: I got all the roots except for the character who looked super young and I was like I can't finish this game.

934
00:56:16,543 --> 00:56:18,233
Guest: sorry bye that was the game.

935
00:56:18,394 --> 00:56:21,473
Guest: that was actually the game that I broke by trying to go the platonic route.

936
00:56:21,855 --> 00:56:26,412
Guest: oh yeah I didn't accept anybody's advances and then the game crashed.

937
00:56:27,775 --> 00:56:29,619
Guest: it just straight-up crashed and I reproduced the bug.

938
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:36,984
Rym: you know if you open that bug ticket like they wouldn't understand.

939
00:56:37,004 --> 00:56:40,018
Guest: I don't know if that that might have been by their previous company groover.

940
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:42,308
Guest: so hi what's up?

941
00:56:42,368 --> 00:56:44,259
Guest: I'm a font of visual novel knowledge.

942
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:44,783
Guest: come at me.

943
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:47,821
Guest: anyway I've been playing this game which has been really really sad.

944
00:56:47,861 --> 00:56:55,679
Scott: this you know though I can't fault you because one is legit research and two I mean if my job was to make these things I'd have to suffer through them.

945
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:57,632
Guest: it raised a half a million dollars on Kickstarter.

946
00:56:57,812 --> 00:57:06,427
Rym: whoa yeah well uh we've played a lot of kick-started board games and all I will say is that sometimes I'll get an email.

947
00:57:06,447 --> 00:57:11,729
Rym: in fact recently we got an email from a pretty big name game developer who didn't like that.

948
00:57:11,749 --> 00:57:13,359
Rym: we'd played his game and talked about it.

949
00:57:13,399 --> 00:57:16,056
Rym: the way that we talked about it because we were kind of down on it.

950
00:57:16,578 --> 00:57:17,885
Rym: we played a lot of bad games.

951
00:57:17,926 --> 00:57:18,710
Guest: yeah what are they gonna do?

952
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:24,638
Guest: like come to your house and be like hey stop talking about our game like yeah do that maybe make a better game next time.

953
00:57:26,504 --> 00:57:30,278
Rym: but lately the thing I've been watching a lot on YouTube is red suprays.

954
00:57:31,483 --> 00:57:32,466
Rym: you know about red supray?

955
00:57:33,049 --> 00:57:35,079
Guest: I mean it sounds like you're saying let's play but wrong.

956
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:44,313
Rym: so what they do is they watch other people's let's plays and they just make fun of them and this concept sounds really mean-spirited.

957
00:57:44,333 --> 00:57:44,815
Rym: it kind of is.

958
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:45,880
Guest: it sounds like it?

959
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:56,260
Rym: yeah and yeah I learned a lot about what it means to be human watching those things the the best one ever is just titled Mario party of one.

960
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:00,657
Scott: all right where they watch the guy play Mario party by himself.

961
00:58:00,797 --> 00:58:01,884
Rym: what are you doing in there Johnny?

962
00:58:02,045 --> 00:58:04,999
Rym: nothing just me and my four friends or my three friends.

963
00:58:05,159 --> 00:58:06,505
Scott: calm calm and calm.

964
00:58:06,525 --> 00:58:09,334
Scott: we're just having a having a big ol Mario party.

965
00:58:10,859 --> 00:58:16,478
Rym: and the worst part is the kid loses to the AI like kind of often you got too many stars.

966
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:26,383
Rym: at one point princess peach like runs way past him with a mushroom and then he just like ah she's running away from me just like all the girls do and then he just gets quiet for like a minute.

967
00:58:26,403 --> 00:58:29,514
Guest: this guy's got to work on his radio voice.

968
00:58:29,614 --> 00:58:30,156
Guest: yeah no kidding.

969
00:58:30,196 --> 00:58:35,313
Guest: why does everybody around me keep dying?

970
00:58:35,333 --> 00:58:37,058
Guest: I hate this game.

971
00:58:37,139 --> 00:58:38,584
Guest: I don't want to remilitarize Japan.

972
00:58:38,604 --> 00:58:43,039
Scott: yeah so I'm military Japan to kill the people who made Mario Party.

973
00:58:45,227 --> 00:58:47,677
Guest: so I've been playing Grisaia which has been a slog.

974
00:58:47,999 --> 00:58:49,425
Guest: but guys I fell into the trap.

975
00:58:50,168 --> 00:58:53,860
Guest: I've been playing love live.

976
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:54,863
Guest: I've been playing it.

977
00:58:54,903 --> 00:58:57,614
Guest: I've been playing it a lot it's it's been troublesome.

978
00:58:57,634 --> 00:59:02,278
Rym: you know at least you're not stagnating because I still only pretty much play like counter-strikes at five.

979
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:12,632
Scott: I'm playing hearthstone and netrunner and I just started playing a cookie clicker variant call hi it was on steam yesterday.

980
00:59:12,652 --> 00:59:13,695
Rym: yeah it's a good reason.

981
00:59:13,815 --> 00:59:16,061
Guest: I saw people were all these people in my.

982
00:59:16,642 --> 00:59:22,532
Scott: it kept saying that like people were playing this game you know and my steam friends.

983
00:59:22,954 --> 00:59:24,985
Scott: and it was called like capitalist something.

984
00:59:25,005 --> 00:59:26,473
Scott: and I'm like what the hell is that?

985
00:59:26,513 --> 00:59:32,281
Scott: and I see it's free to play so I could play and it's just a cookie clicker candy box but it's really slick.

986
00:59:32,803 --> 00:59:35,916
Scott: so I'm like oh okay and it runs while like it's closed.

987
00:59:36,017 --> 00:59:37,824
Scott: it's refined heroin.

988
00:59:37,964 --> 00:59:42,144
Guest: yeah exactly so I'm just like oh what if I mean that is that is for what it's worth.

989
00:59:42,205 --> 00:59:44,716
Guest: refined heroin is how I would describe my time with a love life.

990
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:47,588
Guest: they limit you have like it's.

991
00:59:47,689 --> 00:59:50,445
Guest: it's that classic concept that gets me every goddamn time.

992
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:51,914
Guest: they give you a fixed amount of energy.

993
00:59:51,954 --> 00:59:53,342
Guest: they say you want to play a hard song.

994
00:59:53,382 --> 00:59:55,533
Guest: you got to provide 15 love points.

995
00:59:55,693 --> 00:59:59,327
Guest: yeah I only have 40. but man I'm so close to my next level.

996
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:00,431
Guest: I paid a dollar.

997
01:00:00,792 --> 01:00:05,306
Rym: okay I'd say you didn't go past so far.

998
01:00:05,426 --> 01:00:09,141
Scott: I bought both hearthstone adventure expansions which cost a lot more than a dollar.

999
01:00:09,161 --> 01:00:12,957
Guest: I needed one love gem to collect my 11 rare card.

1000
01:00:12,977 --> 01:00:15,807
Guest: I was like I'm not gonna wait.

1001
01:00:15,868 --> 01:00:17,977
Guest: I could have I could guys I could have waited three hours.

1002
01:00:17,997 --> 01:00:24,871
Scott: I mean it's it's surprising like how I've been hooked on so many of those over time but I've managed to just drop all of them.

1003
01:00:24,911 --> 01:00:33,955
Scott: and like I played the one where you grow the molar fish oh I played that for like weeks and then one day I just lead it from my phone and then it was deleted from my memory.

1004
01:00:34,096 --> 01:00:38,362
Scott: like I just didn't have any instinct to go and open it up or any memory of it or any care.

1005
01:00:38,543 --> 01:00:40,432
Guest: that's exactly what happened to be at fallout shelter.

1006
01:00:40,453 --> 01:00:42,359
Scott: exactly same thing with fallout shelter.

1007
01:00:42,419 --> 01:00:48,703
Scott: and same thing with dragon coins which is the coin pushing machine.

1008
01:00:48,763 --> 01:00:52,418
Scott: where then you also have they also fight like an RPG style.

1009
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:53,421
Scott: it's weird.

1010
01:00:54,565 --> 01:00:55,387
Rym: yeah that game.

1011
01:00:55,407 --> 01:00:57,480
Rym: well you show me that game and all I could saw the whole time.

1012
01:00:57,521 --> 01:00:58,932
Rym: all I asked you was why are you playing this?

1013
01:00:59,535 --> 01:01:03,177
Rym: I and then I just needed it and then I know the state fair and put quarters in that machine.

1014
01:01:03,257 --> 01:01:04,243
Rym: it's the same thing.

1015
01:01:04,303 --> 01:01:06,394
Scott: at least one of the state fair gives you money.

1016
01:01:06,414 --> 01:01:10,553
Scott: this one tries to take your money and it gives you fake money in replacement.

1017
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:14,046
Rym: yeah so so more importantly are you?

1018
01:01:14,247 --> 01:01:16,414
Rym: uh are you caught up on any animes?

1019
01:01:16,534 --> 01:01:17,016
Rym: are you watching?

1020
01:01:17,036 --> 01:01:18,540
Scott: see my time animes on Tuesday.

1021
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:24,324
Guest: okay so I mean me and Joe actually made sure to get nice and caught up.

1022
01:01:24,404 --> 01:01:25,390
Guest: that was that was nice.

1023
01:01:25,511 --> 01:01:27,061
Rym: yeah Scott doesn't watch again.

1024
01:01:27,082 --> 01:01:29,095
Rym: I'm just trying to pressure him into watching it so we can do a show on.

1025
01:01:29,155 --> 01:01:29,437
Scott: it's it.

1026
01:01:29,537 --> 01:01:30,261
Scott: I downloaded it.

1027
01:01:30,684 --> 01:01:33,398
Rym: I want to do like GeekNights presents Steven Universe.

1028
01:01:33,639 --> 01:01:34,765
Scott: well I've been sure.

1029
01:01:34,805 --> 01:01:35,448
Scott: antenna first.

1030
01:01:35,589 --> 01:01:36,392
Guest: I really enjoy it.

1031
01:01:36,412 --> 01:01:41,571
Guest: uh as far as as far as anime we're watching gacham on crowds right now.

01:01:42,898 --> 01:01:43,743
Scott: that looked interesting.

1034
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:44,789
Rym: we reviewed it already.

1035
01:01:44,809 --> 01:01:47,083
Scott: do I need to watch any other gachamons any things?

Scott: and how does it know the one?

1039
01:01:49,981 --> 01:01:52,476
Scott: how does it relate to the old gosh man with the bird people?

1040
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:53,883
Guest: that's very good.

1041
01:01:53,903 --> 01:01:55,390
Scott: what is the connection I have?

1042
01:01:55,490 --> 01:01:56,593
Guest: no I did not know.

1043
01:01:56,614 --> 01:01:59,041
Guest: there was an original betraying somewhat my my.

Guest: that's been great.

1047
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:07,680
Guest: or a Monogatari is I think the sweetest yes ever been produced?

1048
01:02:07,921 --> 01:02:10,652
Rym: that show gets so many points for the third episode.

1049
01:02:10,692 --> 01:02:13,142
Scott: why don't you make the visual novel of that?

1050
01:02:13,805 --> 01:02:14,548
Guest: I would man.

1051
01:02:14,568 --> 01:02:15,674
Guest: hey put me in touch with somebody.

1052
01:02:15,714 --> 01:02:16,460
Guest: let's go do it.

1053
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:16,883
Scott: who cares?

1054
01:02:16,923 --> 01:02:18,958
Scott: if they try to stop you are they gonna do about it?

1055
01:02:18,978 --> 01:02:20,610
Guest: see once you have a company these things become very.

1056
01:02:22,136 --> 01:02:24,364
Scott: you just release that one on like BitTorrent no one knows.

1057
01:02:25,448 --> 01:02:26,713
Rym: no one knows it was you?

1058
01:02:26,773 --> 01:02:28,501
Guest: that's right and no one can pay.

1059
01:02:28,521 --> 01:02:29,505
Guest: and then we don't eat.

1060
01:02:29,525 --> 01:02:31,513
Scott: you can get donations you know.

1061
01:02:31,593 --> 01:02:33,861
Rym: well you also make it a crypto Bitcoin.

1062
01:02:34,062 --> 01:02:37,979
Guest: did I tell you guys I cashed out all my bitcoins for magic cards.

1063
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:39,366
Guest: what that's real?

1064
01:02:39,607 --> 01:02:40,492
Scott: why would you get magic?

1065
01:02:40,613 --> 01:02:42,302
Scott: wait bitcoins are like a new thing.

1066
01:02:42,342 --> 01:02:44,312
Scott: that means you've played magic this recently.

1067
01:02:44,433 --> 01:02:46,361
Scott: yeah why are you playing magic?

1068
01:02:46,702 --> 01:02:48,509
Rym: wait did you buy them on Mount Gox?

1069
01:02:48,529 --> 01:02:49,172
Guest: I didn't.

1070
01:02:49,252 --> 01:02:50,938
Guest: okay legitimate question.

1071
01:02:51,038 --> 01:02:53,226
Guest: no I bought them on Abu games.

1072
01:02:53,286 --> 01:02:53,627
Guest: calm.

1073
01:02:54,009 --> 01:02:58,914
Guest: the only retailer I could find basically it was during that massive crash that happened in like January.

1074
01:02:58,974 --> 01:03:01,202
Rym: I believe they were crashing.

1075
01:03:01,443 --> 01:03:02,266
Guest: yeah I I.

1076
01:03:02,707 --> 01:03:04,994
Scott: so when did you get bitcoins?

1077
01:03:05,014 --> 01:03:06,818
Guest: uh late last year.

1078
01:03:06,838 --> 01:03:09,405
Scott: so recently yeah yeah by drugs.

1079
01:03:09,525 --> 01:03:12,234
Scott: but why would you buy Bitcoin?

1080
01:03:12,274 --> 01:03:13,581
Guest: I was legitimately just curious.

1081
01:03:13,621 --> 01:03:15,371
Scott: so I just like how big lines work.

1082
01:03:15,391 --> 01:03:19,773
Guest: there is a tale of woe here because I mined out to full goddamn bitcoins.

1083
01:03:19,813 --> 01:03:21,020
Guest: you actually mind coins?

1084
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:22,810
Guest: straight up mind about a fair use GPU.

1085
01:03:22,810 --> 01:03:25,547
Rym: yeah there was a time you could just mine coins that we consumer PC.

1086
01:03:25,628 --> 01:03:26,834
Guest: oh there was a time you could do it.

1087
01:03:26,874 --> 01:03:27,939
Guest: I never even try you.

1088
01:03:28,602 --> 01:03:29,445
Guest: and then they're.

1089
01:03:29,767 --> 01:03:37,082
Guest: they're gone now I don't know where they live and some kind of wallet who knows yeah in a wallet that I don't have access to and is lost.

1090
01:03:37,122 --> 01:03:40,017
Guest: the problem with Bitcoin yeah one of the things right like.

1091
01:03:40,339 --> 01:03:42,992
Guest: okay for real can we talk about the money supply of Bitcoin?

1092
01:03:43,053 --> 01:03:47,369
Guest: super fast does the money supply continue to shrink like that is?

1093
01:03:47,530 --> 01:03:49,156
Guest: dipshits like me lose their wallets?

1094
01:03:49,898 --> 01:03:54,898
Rym: uh well yes but because they're so divisible it probably doesn't matter.

1095
01:03:54,918 --> 01:03:58,738
Rym: I don't know like I don't think the inflation of them.

1096
01:03:58,778 --> 01:04:02,818
Rym: I'm more worried about the integrity of the integrity of the Bitcoin chain over time.

1097
01:04:02,858 --> 01:04:04,325
Guest: yeah okay thank you given.

1098
01:04:04,505 --> 01:04:07,820
Guest: given like high-profile investments by like the Winklevoss twin yeah like.

1099
01:04:07,961 --> 01:04:08,383
Rym: yeah.

1100
01:04:08,564 --> 01:04:18,307
Rym: if someone has a controlling interest in the blockchain and they already might yep then they own Bitcoin yeah which is honestly like I had a couple there.

1101
01:04:18,367 --> 01:04:19,231
Guest: I didn't have a couple.

1102
01:04:19,291 --> 01:04:20,335
Guest: I had a couple and lost them.

1103
01:04:20,576 --> 01:04:22,864
Guest: I had some shreds Bitcoin dust.

1104
01:04:23,065 --> 01:04:27,060
Guest: I guess I turned him into magic cards and I'm done so.

1105
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:35,593
Rym: I'm on the committee in the FPL to basically figure out how to normalize Bitcoin and blockchain transactions in financial protocols.

1106
01:04:35,634 --> 01:04:41,640
Rym: so like exchanges can like use them in stream how about you work on the confirmation time?

1107
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:42,022
Guest: somehow?

1108
01:04:42,083 --> 01:04:43,551
Guest: how about you get in touch with mr.

1109
01:04:43,612 --> 01:04:44,295
Guest: Satoshi?

1110
01:04:44,476 --> 01:04:47,410
Guest: yeah see what he can do for you reducing that confirmation time.

1111
01:04:47,610 --> 01:04:50,364
Guest: because if yeah sorry hey what's up?

1112
01:04:50,404 --> 01:04:52,071
Guest: never mind I'm not gonna turn this in a Bitcoin.

1113
01:04:52,111 --> 01:04:57,947
Scott: yes I guess we know it's not Conrad Satoshi cradling.

1114
01:04:57,967 --> 01:05:00,634
Rym: he's planting a red herring here right now.

1115
01:05:00,654 --> 01:05:02,999
Guest: okay so I understand how payments work.

1116
01:05:03,019 --> 01:05:07,923
Guest: if I'm fucking piece of gum I can't wait 30 minutes to find out if I have the bitcoins for it.

1117
01:05:07,943 --> 01:05:10,171
Guest: I need to be able to pay and leave the CBS.

1118
01:05:11,255 --> 01:05:17,298
Rym: but you could do that to buy say illegal merchandise that's being shipped to you in a dead drop.

1119
01:05:17,358 --> 01:05:20,473
Scott: yeah wait this is still Tuesday gaming.

1120
01:05:20,533 --> 01:05:21,820
Scott: right you're just talking about magic cards.

1121
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:22,845
Scott: why are you playing magic?

1122
01:05:22,885 --> 01:05:23,026
Scott: what?

1123
01:05:23,187 --> 01:05:23,991
Scott: what's going on there?

1124
01:05:24,011 --> 01:05:25,880
Rym: wait what magic is this?

1125
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:26,683
Scott: 1995?

1126
01:05:26,683 --> 01:05:33,652
Rym: wait with these individual magic cards over these boxes very individuals wait what cars did you buy?

1127
01:05:33,712 --> 01:05:35,881
Scott: much magic are you playing and what decks are you playing?

1128
01:05:35,921 --> 01:05:44,403
Guest: okay so I unfortunately you know this is during a time when when I was doing some freelance work I had disposable income but I also had some like time.

1129
01:05:44,443 --> 01:05:45,307
Rym: well you dispose of it?

1130
01:05:45,348 --> 01:05:45,709
Rym: alright.

1131
01:05:46,634 --> 01:05:47,760
Guest: well no I just supposed to bitcoins.

1132
01:05:47,780 --> 01:05:50,167
Guest: it was very convenient.

1133
01:05:50,428 --> 01:05:54,983
Guest: so I you know we were playing and and I got I got some some cards.

1134
01:05:55,064 --> 01:05:55,505
Guest: I got them.

1135
01:05:56,108 --> 01:06:02,679
Guest: I had a deck that was based around Zalgo zergo helm smasher namely because we were playing commander and I really like the suit.

1136
01:06:02,699 --> 01:06:03,905
Guest: I wanted to run a goblin deck.

1137
01:06:04,206 --> 01:06:04,809
Guest: he was an ogre.

1138
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:10,370
Guest: so I made this like like green and nasty except it was white red black.

1139
01:06:10,731 --> 01:06:12,336
Rym: yeah that's too many colors for commander.

1140
01:06:12,357 --> 01:06:14,768
Guest: you actually want a three color spread.

1141
01:06:15,292 --> 01:06:16,961
Guest: three color spreads of commander are totally valid.

1142
01:06:17,323 --> 01:06:19,190
Scott: okay Wow magic's changed a lot.

1143
01:06:19,792 --> 01:06:28,306
Guest: yeah yeah rather than just doing the standard format where you have like 20 life and you know I forget what the optimal deck size is we never play.

1144
01:06:28,326 --> 01:06:28,486
Guest: stand.

1145
01:06:28,506 --> 01:06:33,747
Rym: back in my day in the old days 40 was the minimum.

1146
01:06:33,787 --> 01:06:36,317
Scott: well yeah when I play back in the 90s it would in the.

1147
01:06:36,679 --> 01:06:41,102
Scott: in the instruction book it said 40 was the minimum but at the tournament 60 was the minute.

1148
01:06:41,122 --> 01:06:43,775
Guest: yeah correct right I believe you guys have the right of it.

1149
01:06:43,835 --> 01:06:47,158
Guest: and again I'm betraying the fact that I don't play standard I only play commander.

1150
01:06:47,359 --> 01:06:50,361
Rym: well we're betraying the fact that I stopped playing magic when fallen empires came out.

1151
01:06:51,325 --> 01:06:53,695
Guest: hey listen I'm not gonna throw stone like.

1152
01:06:53,755 --> 01:06:59,092
Guest: obviously I'm in a glass house right now just like you know.

1153
01:06:59,332 --> 01:06:59,613
Guest: we got.

1154
01:06:59,673 --> 01:07:03,004
Guest: we got really into it again and but but my interest has waned.

1155
01:07:03,024 --> 01:07:06,296
Guest: I think I love net runner.

1156
01:07:06,316 --> 01:07:07,099
Guest: don't don't get me wrong.

1157
01:07:07,119 --> 01:07:10,341
Guest: I had the privilege of playing with some some fine folks a couple months ago and it was.

1158
01:07:10,461 --> 01:07:11,747
Guest: it was a blast yeah.

1159
01:07:12,048 --> 01:07:12,972
Scott: so why don't you play at all time?

1160
01:07:13,937 --> 01:07:16,383
Scott: you got meetups on anymore.

1161
01:07:16,464 --> 01:07:16,785
Guest: I turned.

1162
01:07:16,805 --> 01:07:18,313
Guest: I turned bitcoins into magic.

1163
01:07:18,353 --> 01:07:24,649
Scott: I turned magic money into magic cards and now I can't just turn the magic cards in an hour your cards and you'll be done or back into bitcoins.

1164
01:07:25,894 --> 01:07:28,684
Scott: I guess that's that opens your options a lot wider - you can just turn me into drugs.

1165
01:07:29,166 --> 01:07:30,992
Scott: yeah drugs drugs for drugs.

1166
01:07:32,075 --> 01:07:33,761
Rym: wait is this?

1167
01:07:33,962 --> 01:07:34,765
Guest: oh I'm going to jail now.

1168
01:07:34,785 --> 01:07:39,007
Scott: nevermind I know Adderall's been a hot topic on this show and that's right.

1169
01:07:39,068 --> 01:07:41,141
Guest: no white person has ever gone to jail for taking Adderall.

1170
01:07:41,302 --> 01:07:43,749
Rym: no I saw the worst statistic.

1171
01:07:43,769 --> 01:07:49,171
Rym: it basically said that like marijuana is legal for white people in New York State.

1172
01:07:49,432 --> 01:07:50,035
Scott: yep pretty much.

1173
01:07:50,257 --> 01:07:51,484
Rym: by the way the arrests have broken down.

1174
01:07:51,746 --> 01:07:52,592
Rym: I believe you're white.

1175
01:07:52,753 --> 01:07:54,061
Rym: you could just have all the weed you want.

1176
01:07:54,502 --> 01:07:55,104
Guest: is it targeted?

1177
01:07:55,124 --> 01:07:55,666
Guest: you can run.

1178
01:07:55,686 --> 01:08:03,134
Rym: yes almost all of the enforcement of marijuana laws in New York City was during stop-and-frisk.

1179
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:04,158
Guest: oh go figure.

1180
01:08:04,399 --> 01:08:08,803
Rym: yeah it turns out there weren't that many guns just guys with like half a roach in their bags of weed.

1181
01:08:08,823 --> 01:08:11,512
Guest: yeah yeah cool good job New York.

1182
01:08:11,733 --> 01:08:12,234
Guest: thanks Bill.

1183
01:08:12,836 --> 01:08:15,667
Rym: yeah Bill actually Bill's shutting that down.

1184
01:08:15,727 --> 01:08:19,362
Rym: thank Bill's actually doing his best job he can.

1185
01:08:19,402 --> 01:08:21,898
Rym: the problem is bill doesn't actually decide anything.

1186
01:08:21,917 --> 01:08:23,064
Scott: there's been less whoa.

1187
01:08:23,225 --> 01:08:25,557
Scott: there's been less gaming on this Tuesday show percentage.

1188
01:08:25,738 --> 01:08:28,031
Scott: I'm so sorry than any Tuesday show I have done.

1189
01:08:28,313 --> 01:08:29,559
Scott: not that I disagree with anything.

1190
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:32,174
Scott: that was just because I don't how to lose money.

1191
01:08:32,234 --> 01:08:34,261
Guest: a Bitcoin the counter curling story.

1192
01:08:34,282 --> 01:08:38,229
Scott: Bitcoin is sort of a game a losing game game.

1193
01:08:38,270 --> 01:08:45,234
Rym: yes the Winklevoss sorry I've actually give you if you played a crypt of the neck or dancer.

1194
01:08:45,254 --> 01:08:46,582
Guest: I'm not familiar with this.

1195
01:08:46,642 --> 01:08:47,908
Rym: now there's kind of a rhythm.

1196
01:08:48,010 --> 01:08:50,545
Scott: is a rhythm roguelike but it's not too much rhythm I need.

1197
01:08:50,585 --> 01:08:51,350
Scott: it needs more rhythm.

1198
01:08:51,430 --> 01:08:52,397
Rym: it's way more rhythm.

1199
01:08:52,417 --> 01:08:53,221
Rym: you just haven't played it.

1200
01:08:53,242 --> 01:08:54,086
Scott: they added more rhythm.

1201
01:08:54,346 --> 01:08:59,327
Rym: you pull its rhythm in that the the enemies have really complex patterns uh-huh.

1202
01:08:59,889 --> 01:09:02,537
Rym: so it's a rhythm roguelike as in.

1203
01:09:02,798 --> 01:09:06,529
Rym: move move move dig move potion spell move.

1204
01:09:08,055 --> 01:09:08,577
Rym: I don't know what else.

1205
01:09:08,596 --> 01:09:09,660
Rym: I can say you just play it.

1206
01:09:10,524 --> 01:09:12,211
Scott: huh it rims really into that lately.

1207
01:09:12,513 --> 01:09:13,216
Guest: it sounds fun.

1208
01:09:13,256 --> 01:09:14,139
Guest: it sounds like a blast.

1209
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:15,345
Guest: I played a sneak beat.

1210
01:09:15,546 --> 01:09:17,978
Guest: I believe it was called on iOS back in the day.

1211
01:09:17,999 --> 01:09:18,501
Guest: that was fun.

1212
01:09:19,062 --> 01:09:19,724
Rym: yeah we're not playing.

1213
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:20,466
Guest: love live now.

1214
01:09:20,567 --> 01:09:21,389
Guest: so just bury me.

1215
01:09:21,448 --> 01:09:25,282
Scott: I guess all right are we done here?

1216
01:09:25,303 --> 01:09:26,028
Rym: I think we're done.

1217
01:09:26,048 --> 01:09:26,733
Rym: it's been about an hour.

1218
01:09:26,752 --> 01:09:27,640
