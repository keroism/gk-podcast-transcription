1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:13,000
Rym: It's Monday July 27th 2015.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,089
Rym: I'm Rym I am a Scott and this is an episode of GeekNights.

3
00:00:17,129 --> 00:00:23,416
Rym: tonight We're gonna talk about when things go away You know like services and things just disappear or when I go away.

4
00:00:23,556 --> 00:00:26,160
Rym: Yeah, couldn't really come up with a better title for this one.

5
00:00:27,591 --> 00:00:28,622
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,812 --> 00:00:36,843
Rym: So I biked like a hundred and thirty miles this weekend Many miles a good weekend for biking actually.

7
00:00:37,446 --> 00:00:39,456
Rym: in fact we were thinking like oh We'll make some video.

8
00:00:39,476 --> 00:00:40,984
Rym: like we got a big backlog of video to make.

9
00:00:41,004 --> 00:00:42,030
Rym: we'll make some video on Sunday.

10
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:42,735
Rym: And I was like Scott.

11
00:00:42,996 --> 00:00:47,998
Scott: Let's make some video on Sunday, and then on Sunday I was waiting for you to be like hey Let's make some video, but you didn't.

12
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:49,529
Scott: so I played a video game all day.

13
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:57,987
Rym: Yeah, and I was like I'm gonna make some video after I go biking, and I just went biking way all day Biking all day Saturday, but not Sunday.

14
00:00:58,128 --> 00:01:02,768
Rym: yep I biked to Rockaway with Emily and then we walked around and like stood in the water for a while.

15
00:01:03,211 --> 00:01:05,110
Rym: Then we biked back up home.

16
00:01:05,251 --> 00:01:06,229
Scott: Why did you go in the water?

17
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:12,389
Rym: Because we didn't bring our swimsuits cuz we didn't think we'd swim and then we got there and we wanted to swim And next time we're bringing our swimsuits.

18
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:15,680
Rym: So uh then the way back wasn't long enough.

19
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:15,921
Rym: I guess.

20
00:01:15,941 --> 00:01:18,009
Rym: so we looped around Prospect Park a bunch and then went home.

21
00:01:19,091 --> 00:01:24,654
Rym: Then we went back out again like back the way we came to go to some pig roasts thing that was down in Williamsburg With some friends.

22
00:01:24,674 --> 00:01:28,883
Rym: that was cool mm-hmm But it was the pig roast was not as there.

23
00:01:29,004 --> 00:01:29,828
Rym: I could have had more pig.

24
00:01:31,452 --> 00:01:32,676
Scott: It was a. it was a.

25
00:01:32,716 --> 00:01:34,903
Rym: there's mostly a beer roast with pig.

26
00:01:34,923 --> 00:01:39,548
Rym: the pig was super good But I could eat more mm-hmm.

27
00:01:40,611 --> 00:01:41,770
Rym: Whatever, I feel like this right.

28
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:42,673
Rym: It seems like this bar.

29
00:01:42,714 --> 00:01:47,738
Rym: what they did is they got some other company to come and just like roast a pig and then they Just sold tickets.

30
00:01:47,779 --> 00:01:48,649
Rym: like it was a big event.

31
00:01:49,051 --> 00:01:56,690
Rym: But really it was just a restaurant that had another tiny restaurant with contractors inside of it running one item on a separate menu.

32
00:01:57,413 --> 00:01:59,502
Rym: So they didn't put a lot like the pig was like.

33
00:01:59,683 --> 00:02:03,980
Rym: effort was put into the pig part But the restaurant did not put effort into the whole.

34
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,629
Rym: like this is a pig roast aspect of it mm-hmm.

35
00:02:06,871 --> 00:02:09,610
Scott: So you know there's the John Brown barbecue right over here.

36
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:14,849
Rym: I do know because cliffs at LIC members get a discount once a week, so you know it's.

37
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:17,907
Scott: you know It's pretty good there, but sometimes the service is in.

38
00:02:17,948 --> 00:02:21,826
Scott: the service There is super as there is not, but the cornbread is yeah.

39
00:02:23,191 --> 00:02:29,831
Rym: As you walk in there in the evening like yeah, we're out of everything right, so there's a place down near I.

40
00:02:29,851 --> 00:02:35,049
Scott: just we found using Google Maps near the game store where we play netrunner called fat.

41
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:36,676
Scott: so I don't know if you heard of that.

42
00:02:36,716 --> 00:02:37,781
Scott: It's my house.

43
00:02:37,901 --> 00:02:39,830
Scott: Yeah, it's mildly famous for that place.

44
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:46,390
Scott: Yeah, we went to that place after a netrunner tournament two weeks ago, and that was they did not even have cornbread.

45
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:49,710
Scott: They just gave you like dinner rolls that come from a bag from the grocery store.

46
00:02:50,413 --> 00:02:57,602
Scott: But everything else it's by the pound and it is Like all the other things besides cornbread, which they didn't even have.

47
00:02:57,762 --> 00:02:58,726
Scott: maybe they have it other times.

48
00:02:58,766 --> 00:03:03,669
Scott: They didn't have it the day we went Way better than John Brown barbecue our money.

49
00:03:04,513 --> 00:03:10,114
Scott: But the ribs the sauce the be everything was All right, I'm into this.

50
00:03:11,037 --> 00:03:13,666
Scott: so and they even have free water.

51
00:03:13,746 --> 00:03:14,930
Scott: we could fill up our water bottles.

52
00:03:15,411 --> 00:03:18,961
Scott: So maybe you know next Sunday there's a netrunner, I don't know.

53
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:20,404
Scott: is there anything else happening next Sunday?

54
00:03:21,146 --> 00:03:24,317
Rym: next Sunday yeah Possibly a bunch of things.

55
00:03:24,418 --> 00:03:32,650
Rym: maybe some of our friends might bike here And then we'll have a weekend hanging out or possibly go out to Rhode Island or maybe also go to the shore.

56
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,877
Rym: Everything happens next week.

57
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:39,168
Scott: next Sunday is August first second right.

58
00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:41,019
Rym: yeah I guess August then.

59
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,370
Scott: so summer streets is Saturday.

60
00:03:43,276 --> 00:03:48,024
Scott: But yeah on Sunday After the netrunner tournament you can go over there again.

61
00:03:49,492 --> 00:03:54,394
Scott: No, I can eat that every two weeks, and then I die happy even if it shortens my life Few years.

62
00:03:55,096 --> 00:03:57,643
Rym: so for once it being Monday.

63
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:04,290
Rym: We have some science news Because the night's Monday is supposed to be technology and science.

64
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:13,732
Rym: We don't know anything about science though once we got an astronomer on the show our friend Timo know stuff about stuff But we're not really Scientists.

65
00:04:13,893 --> 00:04:22,616
Rym: like my knowledge of science kind of camps out at AP biology and AP physics that I took in high school In computer science.

66
00:04:22,676 --> 00:04:23,940
Scott: is science in name only?

67
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:32,665
Scott: yeah, I mean there are some people who do Research and experiments and follow the scientific method regards to computers that you know.

68
00:04:33,568 --> 00:04:34,230
Scott: that is not me.

69
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,061
Rym: so you know what you remember.

70
00:04:36,081 --> 00:04:43,070
Rym: the Five tastes the unique tastes that the human tongue can detect independently correct.

71
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,470
Scott: sweetness yeah saltiness.

72
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:52,210
Rym: Sourness yeah bitterness yep, so those are the four that we knew for a long time.

73
00:04:52,712 --> 00:04:58,085
Rym: Not that long ago a fifth one was discovered the hippie taste of umami umami.

74
00:04:58,972 --> 00:05:05,269
Rym: Yes, the thing that only a hippie or foodie would say or you know that basically is just the taste of MSG.

75
00:05:05,329 --> 00:05:13,547
Scott: if you say that word then your brow is Like taped to your forehead like yeah, but it's a thing.

76
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:14,270
Rym: It's a real thing.

77
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:19,769
Scott: Yeah, I mean, it's not you know, but it's sort of like yeah, you till it killed is comfortable, but you're wearing it.

78
00:05:22,183 --> 00:05:30,470
Rym: So scientists like at Purdue Super recently have real evidence that there is in fact a sixth taste.

79
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:31,715
Scott: How do they even like?

80
00:05:31,735 --> 00:05:34,445
Scott: how did they determine that it's actually a different taste?

81
00:05:34,706 --> 00:05:35,650
Rym: oh real easily actually.

82
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:36,494
Scott: What's the experiment?

83
00:05:36,534 --> 00:05:38,042
Rym: like the experiment's always been the same.

84
00:05:38,102 --> 00:05:39,409
Rym: you make a series of?

85
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:43,600
Rym: uniform materials like a uniform paste of some kind.

86
00:05:43,901 --> 00:06:00,370
Rym: so the texture is the same no matter what mm-hmm and you compose each of these of one specific type of chemical or a combination of chemicals and you ask people to categorize them based on taste and You control to make sure they're not using odor.

87
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:08,109
Rym: Maybe they don't have an odor whatever you do so that it's purely based on the receptors in the tongue Like so the sixth taste is fat.

88
00:06:08,972 --> 00:06:14,170
Rym: Okay, now normally it was always assumed that humans taste fat because of its texture.

89
00:06:14,572 --> 00:06:18,190
Rym: It has that like kind of soapy feeling like that kind of like the slippery smooth.

90
00:06:18,672 --> 00:06:23,150
Rym: So no it turns out we can actually taste the fat directly and even better.

91
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,377
Rym: we Never noticed this before.

92
00:06:26,417 --> 00:06:34,704
Rym: because humans if you ask them to categorize you give them a bunch of pace and say Here are five categories to put these food these things in.

93
00:06:35,105 --> 00:06:36,529
Rym: you know the five basic things.

94
00:06:37,233 --> 00:06:40,049
Rym: They'll categorize all the fat along with the bitter.

95
00:06:41,013 --> 00:06:52,070
Rym: But if you give them six categories and one of them is called fat or fatty They will reliably put all the fatty things in that separate fatty category, but I mean put it under bitter.

96
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:54,256
Scott: Okay, so an apple is sweet.

97
00:06:54,718 --> 00:06:57,125
Scott: Yeah, and a banana is sweet.

98
00:06:57,406 --> 00:06:58,570
Rym: Yeah, and a bread is sweet.

99
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:02,280
Scott: I'm in a sugar bread sure like a melon pond.

100
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,490
Scott: Yeah, right, but they don't taste the same.

101
00:07:04,845 --> 00:07:06,698
Rym: No They don't because it's much like sounds.

102
00:07:06,758 --> 00:07:09,370
Rym: God you your your actual sensation of taste.

103
00:07:09,731 --> 00:07:15,850
Scott: And I would still if you take you wrote the categories in the paper as apple melon pond and banana.

104
00:07:16,715 --> 00:07:17,962
Rym: Ah, but there's a difference there.

105
00:07:18,243 --> 00:07:22,682
Rym: Those are complex Manifold flavors that are caused by these.

106
00:07:22,783 --> 00:07:24,790
Rym: six basic things are different.

107
00:07:25,072 --> 00:07:30,396
Scott: So if you take these six pastes that they are using in this experiment Yeah, combine them in the correct proportion.

108
00:07:30,878 --> 00:07:34,067
Scott: You could create any flavor including banana.

109
00:07:34,147 --> 00:07:38,342
Scott: Yes, or I don't know foie gras.

110
00:07:38,604 --> 00:07:39,510
Rym: That is in fact true.

111
00:07:40,212 --> 00:07:46,649
Scott: I would like to see that proven the opportunity those six pace and combine them in the correct proportion to make banana.

112
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:55,979
Rym: now The problem is that the human sensation has two other factors the texture Which we use for a lot of reasons.

113
00:07:56,019 --> 00:07:59,070
Rym: a lot of people have trouble with certain kinds of textures and the smell.

114
00:07:59,653 --> 00:08:02,790
Rym: So there's three sets of things that determine our taste.

115
00:08:03,211 --> 00:08:06,622
Rym: But it is interesting that we have a specific receptor for fat.

116
00:08:06,722 --> 00:08:09,893
Scott: and further like you're holding your nose and eating it Yeah, you'll still taste.

117
00:08:10,033 --> 00:08:11,217
Scott: Oh, I got you.

118
00:08:11,237 --> 00:08:12,020
Rym: So here's the thing.

119
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,542
Scott: I got you.

120
00:08:12,562 --> 00:08:14,649
Rym: Apparently fat tastes like shit.

121
00:08:15,736 --> 00:08:30,461
Rym: Humans categorically reject food that triggers this in any significant quantity because the only time our tongue is Stimulated by that receptor a whole bunch without the other ones overpowering.

122
00:08:30,522 --> 00:08:33,008
Rym: It is rancid and decaying meat.

123
00:08:33,489 --> 00:08:33,649
Scott: Mm-hmm.

124
00:08:34,071 --> 00:08:44,798
Rym: So yeah, that's why humans tended to put it in the bitter category Mmm, and while we're on this topic, you know that map of where you taste different things on your tongue is bullshit Complete bullshit always been bullshit.

125
00:08:44,818 --> 00:08:45,341
Rym: That was net.

126
00:08:45,361 --> 00:08:46,889
Rym: there was never any evidence of that.

127
00:08:47,311 --> 00:08:50,342
Scott: Yeah, I mean swimming after eating doesn't give you cramps either.

128
00:08:50,382 --> 00:08:52,710
Rym: you watch the same video that I watch recently.

129
00:08:52,851 --> 00:08:56,870
Scott: I think I mean, I think I knew before that that it was bullshit.

130
00:08:57,031 --> 00:09:00,244
Scott: But it's something my mom would always stop me from going in the pool after I eat.

131
00:09:00,566 --> 00:09:02,172
Rym: My mom was always like, yeah That's BS.

132
00:09:02,213 --> 00:09:02,855
Rym: Just go swimming.

133
00:09:03,197 --> 00:09:06,130
Scott: But I think I already knew it was B. I was just reminded that it was BS.

134
00:09:06,431 --> 00:09:09,790
Rym: Well, I remember as a kid I was like wait, so what if I just get in the tub?

135
00:09:10,251 --> 00:09:12,058
Rym: Get a cramp just sitting?

136
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:14,305
Scott: oh no a cramp big deal.

137
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:17,157
Scott: I want to go in the pool now Warm the sun's out.

138
00:09:17,177 --> 00:09:17,943
Scott: It's going down soon.

139
00:09:17,963 --> 00:09:18,406
Scott: I just ate.

140
00:09:18,648 --> 00:09:24,314
Rym: Yep The only reason I ever had a way to actually go in the pool is because my dad was testing the pH and like doing All that stuff.

141
00:09:24,334 --> 00:09:25,198
Scott: I had to skim it first.

142
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:27,550
Rym: Yeah, I jump in without skimming is giving later skimming.

143
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,139
Scott: I don't want to swim a bunch of leaves though.

144
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:35,526
Scott: Yeah, I Was more worried about the pH and you jump off that ladder about leaves in the face.

145
00:09:35,546 --> 00:09:36,590
Scott: Yeah, not good.

146
00:09:37,092 --> 00:09:44,895
Rym: So a second science news, so Scott, did you ever study any Quantum theory.

147
00:09:45,176 --> 00:09:57,148
Scott: I know the things a layman knows about quantum physics But not just a layman layman a nerd layman who's watched some you know, read some issues of National Geographic Or watch some TV shows on Discovery or PBS.

148
00:09:57,711 --> 00:10:04,977
Scott: So like read a few fictions and maybe like one or two non fictions like a Stephen Hawking book So long time ago that I forget most of.

149
00:10:04,997 --> 00:10:08,147
Rym: yeah, so but what I'm making clear here because I'm in a similar boat.

150
00:10:08,749 --> 00:10:13,169
Rym: we Barely, if at all know what we're about to talk about.

151
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:19,673
Scott: so you're Two or three a lot more about chemistry than I know about Quantum physics.

152
00:10:19,733 --> 00:10:23,324
Rym: at least a few of you are going to be really unhappy with us.

153
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:29,042
Scott: for the next like four minutes I'll just say less to be less stupid because we don't know about something.

154
00:10:29,383 --> 00:10:30,246
Scott: people on the earth.

155
00:10:30,246 --> 00:10:31,550
Scott: 10 Lee don't learn this lesson.

156
00:10:32,314 --> 00:10:33,500
Scott: It's a really good lesson to learn.

157
00:10:33,903 --> 00:10:38,310
Scott: when you don't know about something Don't talk, you know, there's a sign on happiness.

158
00:10:38,451 --> 00:10:44,690
Rym: Not that long ago where a guy is like standing me a guys at a computer and guys standing behind I'm just bitching about a bunch of stuff like his life's going bad.

159
00:10:44,931 --> 00:10:54,729
Rym: He's talking about all his problems and the guy was like the guy who was sitting there quietly listening just turns around and says You know what a wise man once said that's relevant to your situation and the guy's like what he's like nothing.

160
00:10:57,658 --> 00:11:00,129
Rym: so Quarks, right.

161
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:06,383
Rym: so Quarks as far as we can tell basically the fundamental particle.

162
00:11:06,403 --> 00:11:08,228
Scott: I thought there was something even smaller.

163
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:10,577
Scott: what I Thought there was something small.

164
00:11:10,597 --> 00:11:10,637
Rym: No.

165
00:11:10,939 --> 00:11:12,510
Scott: All right shows what I know that core.

166
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,902
Scott: Well in the very least Cory said I didn't know anything.

167
00:11:14,923 --> 00:11:24,707
Rym: work seemed to be fundamental and Combination of them make up like our baryons and mesons like the higher like protons they write a proton is three quarks and a neutron is some number or something.

168
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,516
Rym: and so Did you take any?

169
00:11:27,676 --> 00:11:30,610
Rym: well, but here's what I remember from like high school quantum mechanics.

170
00:11:30,912 --> 00:11:38,706
Scott: So even if you remember correctly, which is a long time ago This was like this information if you remembered it correctly is like 15 20 years out of date.

171
00:11:39,911 --> 00:11:50,495
Rym: Yeah, what I know about quantum physics is pretty much what I did in like 1999 and 2000 in high school and then probably Mixed in with that is stuff.

172
00:11:50,555 --> 00:11:53,102
Rym: I read in like slashdot articles in college.

173
00:11:53,283 --> 00:11:53,464
Scott: Yep.

174
00:11:54,286 --> 00:11:55,108
Rym: That's my knowledge here.

175
00:11:55,128 --> 00:11:59,070
Rym: So You know, there's charges right like positive and negative.

176
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:02,841
Rym: So an atom by default has to have a neutral charge.

177
00:12:02,881 --> 00:12:06,994
Scott: if it doesn't then it could be some sort of you know Isotope like an extra.

178
00:12:07,376 --> 00:12:08,239
Rym: No, it's gonna.

179
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,182
Rym: it's gonna be an ion.

180
00:12:09,202 --> 00:12:10,306
Rym: It's not gonna be charged.

181
00:12:10,427 --> 00:12:12,877
Scott: in that case Isotope is a different number of neutrons.

182
00:12:12,957 --> 00:12:13,841
Scott: Yeah, it could have.

183
00:12:13,982 --> 00:12:21,010
Rym: you know, good have an extra electron here there You know, but then but if it has extra electrons, it's gonna have extra protons to have a neutral charge.

184
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:21,813
Scott: Well, it'll be a different.

185
00:12:21,914 --> 00:12:23,239
Rym: It'll be charged proton.

186
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:24,726
Rym: Yes, it'll be charged stable.

187
00:12:25,429 --> 00:12:27,530
Rym: So Quarks are the same way.

188
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:31,090
Rym: For another attribute that we you know, we talked about with colors.

189
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:35,310
Rym: So there's three colors of quarks and they each also have their anti color.

190
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:41,168
Rym: So there's six three and then three anti kind of like how there's one positive charge and one negative charge.

191
00:12:41,188 --> 00:12:46,510
Rym: with electric Dark works like two-thirds one-third like there's they're not I don't know you don't know.

192
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:52,270
Rym: Okay, pretty sure quarks are like a two-thirds of a charge or a one-third of a charge and they gotta add up to a whole.

193
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,361
Rym: Well, anyway, we're not talking about electricity.

194
00:12:54,421 --> 00:12:56,009
Rym: We're talking about the color stuff.

195
00:12:56,672 --> 00:13:06,270
Rym: So in the color stuff to have a stable higher order particle What I remember learning is that they have to be the color has to turn to whites.

196
00:13:06,705 --> 00:13:07,152
Scott: Yep so

197
00:13:07,373 --> 00:13:21,147
Rym: either it's white because you have one of each quark of either the normal, you know that the quarks or one of each of the anti quarks so the color will be white or Have a quark and it's anti color quark -

198
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:21,609
Scott: yep

199
00:13:22,191 --> 00:13:24,843
Rym: So I remember when I would when I learned this.

200
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:27,875
Scott: they're not actually different colors It's just a symbol that hat it's just.

201
00:13:28,056 --> 00:13:29,059
Scott: you know, something happens.

202
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:30,123
Rym: This thing is color.

203
00:13:30,204 --> 00:13:34,719
Scott: So right, obviously, you know It's just a symbology representation that happens to line up.

204
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,750
Rym: Yes, but they have this attribute that we call color.

205
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:49,747
Rym: so dumb young Rym and pretty much any layman will say well What if I had like four quarks or six quarks, but they still add up to white?

206
00:13:49,807 --> 00:13:51,010
Rym: couldn't that be a thing?

207
00:13:51,311 --> 00:13:56,507
Rym: Yes, and it's interesting that in quantum mechanics the layman like well the rules say this.

208
00:13:56,527 --> 00:13:57,250
Rym: So what about that?

209
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,715
Rym: Yeah, totally true.

210
00:13:58,735 --> 00:14:04,509
Rym: and we just fucking apparently with the LHC discovered proof of Penta quarks.

211
00:14:05,571 --> 00:14:13,170
Scott: Yeah, I mean that's how it works right you come up with some rules and you say well According these rules explain the things that we are seeing.

212
00:14:13,832 --> 00:14:22,150
Scott: Wait, but those rules that explain the thing that you are seeing if those rules are true Then we should also be able to see this thing that we've never seen before.

213
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:24,215
Scott: Let's see if we can see that.

214
00:14:24,336 --> 00:14:31,893
Scott: if we can then those rules are probably the right rules and if we can't those rules Are wrong and we need to come up with a different explanation for the things We already saw.

215
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:36,189
Scott: that also includes the new thing that we just you know saw or didn't see.

216
00:14:36,852 --> 00:14:45,803
Scott: so we've had these rules that have explained all the things we've seen so far and Those rules suggest we should be able to see this new thing.

217
00:14:45,884 --> 00:14:46,326
Scott: and we did.

218
00:14:46,346 --> 00:14:50,265
Scott: which means those rules We came up with are more right than rules.

219
00:14:50,325 --> 00:14:51,230
Scott: We came up with before.

220
00:14:53,375 --> 00:15:06,606
Rym: So this is super cool Because it implies that a whole wing of quantum stuff around weird numbers of quarks or even just like a bunch of glue on like Gluons together without any quarks in them, which I think according to this article.

221
00:15:06,746 --> 00:15:07,869
Rym: We call them glue balls.

222
00:15:08,834 --> 00:15:09,719
Rym: They're just glue ons.

223
00:15:10,121 --> 00:15:10,342
Scott: Nice.

224
00:15:10,945 --> 00:15:15,630
Rym: So, uh Yeah, a whole wing of quantum mechanics seems to have a little more evidence.

225
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:18,463
Rym: However, that's what you get from reading the summaries.

226
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:23,859
Rym: Here's the actual Title of the paper with the experiment.

227
00:15:24,301 --> 00:15:26,005
Rym: I don't even know how to read this.

228
00:15:26,687 --> 00:15:31,063
Rym: I don't know what the Observation of Jerry over weird VP resonance.

229
00:15:31,103 --> 00:15:32,147
Scott: It's a Greek character.

230
00:15:32,207 --> 00:15:33,050
Scott: Isn't it a phi?

231
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:34,754
Scott: What the hell is that?

232
00:15:34,894 --> 00:15:36,579
Scott: It's a U with a sword through it.

233
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,144
Rym: A whole bunch of math decays.

234
00:15:38,706 --> 00:15:39,930
Scott: What is that Greek letter?

235
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:44,069
Rym: Observations of exotic structures in mass of.

236
00:15:44,391 --> 00:15:46,100
Scott: Copy and paste that Greek letter into Google.

237
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,486
Scott: So it'll take which one.

238
00:15:47,506 --> 00:15:49,315
Rym: there's a bunch of them The U with the sword through it.

239
00:15:49,355 --> 00:15:49,938
Rym: You want that one?

240
00:15:50,038 --> 00:15:51,063
Scott: Yeah, that's the one I don't know.

241
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:54,143
Rym: I Love that I can copy paste that stuff.

242
00:15:54,163 --> 00:15:56,878
Scott: There's psi Psi, not phi.

243
00:15:56,898 --> 00:15:57,160
Scott: Psi.

244
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,427
Scott: There you go.

245
00:15:59,655 --> 00:16:01,024
Rym: So yeah, science news.

246
00:16:01,426 --> 00:16:04,255
Rym: Psi waves Psi beam.

247
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:05,965
Scott: Okay, so tech news.

248
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:06,870
Scott: today.

249
00:16:07,432 --> 00:16:13,230
Scott: We're recording this on Monday cuz a Monday show but most people listen to Monday shows cuz we put them out at night.

250
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:15,015
Scott: Listen to the morning commute on Tuesday.

251
00:16:15,035 --> 00:16:21,172
Scott: If you're listening to this on Tuesday, guess what today Tuesday the the black Tuesday It's always.

252
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:24,304
Scott: I guess it's not actually black Tuesday black Tuesday the second Tuesday of the month.

253
00:16:24,786 --> 00:16:31,560
Rym: But anyway, July 28th Windows 10 I'm actually kind of excited released.

254
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,949
Scott: if you sign up for the free Windows 10 you can get it.

255
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:39,550
Rym: Yep, apparently you'll be able to get it even if you didn't sign up, but you might have to wait a little while, right?

256
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:59,050
Scott: So the the way we've confirmed that it works right is in your little notification area you sign up You know for the update which I did in all three of my Windows computers And then that computer somehow is gonna get the update All right, and then once you've updated I guess you're gonna do an in-place upgrade just from the internet

257
00:16:59,331 --> 00:17:02,043
Rym: Which honestly in the past like as

258
00:17:02,124 --> 00:17:02,525
Scott: I would.

259
00:17:02,786 --> 00:17:12,193
Rym: okay ish Yeah Okay Ish I have never in my life been comfortable updating windows in place on a system I actually use.

260
00:17:12,233 --> 00:17:12,493
Rym: well

261
00:17:12,674 --> 00:17:26,810
Scott: if you were smart and put windows in a separate partition or drive based on your computing situation You are it has been confirmed going to be able to create Some sort of boot media like a USB stick or something and then be able to do a clean install.

262
00:17:26,892 --> 00:17:27,710
Scott: This has been confirmed.

263
00:17:27,891 --> 00:17:29,035
Rym: That's why I kept tweeting that.

264
00:17:29,055 --> 00:17:34,194
Rym: seriously guys if you have a Windows 7 computer and Windows is not running on an SSD Cuz it's an old computer.

265
00:17:34,214 --> 00:17:37,928
Rym: I mean as these are it's kind of recent that there you can buy an SSD.

266
00:17:37,948 --> 00:17:38,550
Rym: That's affordable.

267
00:17:38,915 --> 00:17:39,624
Rym: That's big enough.

268
00:17:40,951 --> 00:17:43,921
Rym: Buy an SSD like a 256 gigabyte one.

269
00:17:43,961 --> 00:17:45,105
Scott: Their computer has room for it.

270
00:17:45,245 --> 00:17:46,609
Rym: Yeah, they're way cheap.

271
00:17:46,991 --> 00:17:54,050
Rym: Mm-hmm upgrade windows make the install media reinstall windows onto that drive your computer will get like twice as fast.

272
00:17:54,451 --> 00:17:58,230
Scott: Yep, yeah, I've got an SSD with Windows and program files.

273
00:17:58,692 --> 00:18:04,698
Scott: So and I've got a bunch of other hard drives that just have storage and I have a second SSD That's just for swapping when we're editing videos.

274
00:18:04,718 --> 00:18:07,810
Rym: and yeah, I have that plus a few more anyway.

275
00:18:07,971 --> 00:18:10,730
Scott: So I'm gonna unplug the storage drives.

276
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,270
Scott: Just I know windows won't fuck with them.

277
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:18,390
Scott: But just in case then upgrade windows on just the SSD that has windows I can reinstall all the program files.

278
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:19,503
Scott: Who cares about delete those?

279
00:18:19,523 --> 00:18:27,918
Scott: Yeah And it helps because then I'll be sure to get everything up-to-date and be able to make sure that all those programs work Well with Windows 10 and uninstall them if they don't.

280
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:28,300
Rym: Yep.

281
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,929
Scott: You also and also all there's a bunch of programs You've installed over time.

282
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:34,660
Scott: You don't use any that you don't use and it's like you don't know.

283
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,915
Scott: you don't use them and you don't go bother to go Uninstall them.

284
00:18:38,297 --> 00:18:44,143
Scott: So this way you're only gonna install, you know I rec always tell this to people and they don't listen to me right as they go.

285
00:18:44,243 --> 00:18:51,026
Scott: and whether it's a phone or their computer They got like a long list of programs and they're like what app should I install?

286
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,270
Scott: what program should I get?

287
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:54,089
Scott: And they just install a whole bunch of shit.

288
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:59,889
Scott: Don't do that when you install Windows 10 and you're gonna do a clean install because you listen to us, right?

289
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:01,131
Scott: Don't?

290
00:19:01,353 --> 00:19:09,545
Scott: even I install like Chrome Until you actually go at the moment where you say you're going to use it.

291
00:19:09,987 --> 00:19:11,090
Scott: That is when you install it.

292
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:14,170
Scott: So it's like like, you know, you're gonna install steam at some point.

293
00:19:14,431 --> 00:19:16,897
Scott: But don't immediately go and get steam right.

294
00:19:17,037 --> 00:19:21,829
Scott: install Windows 10 and then just start using your computer as you would use it.

295
00:19:21,849 --> 00:19:30,000
Scott: and Then when you get to the point where it's like I want to play a video game and I do not have steam When you think to go click on the steam icon, it's not there.

296
00:19:30,321 --> 00:19:31,023
Scott: That is the moment.

297
00:19:31,043 --> 00:19:32,368
Scott: You should install steam now.

298
00:19:32,428 --> 00:19:41,715
Rym: realistically There's a few things I do always install right away because I just install chrome within probably the first minute and so Minutes off the top of my head.

299
00:19:41,755 --> 00:19:53,522
Rym: the things I will install immediately when I upgrade my first computer and then re you know Do this thing and you're just all doby stuff adobe style steam chrome Notepad plus plus because I just use the shit out of that thing.

300
00:19:53,724 --> 00:19:54,609
Rym: I use them putty.

301
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,549
Rym: Well, I guess we might not need putty anymore.

302
00:19:57,391 --> 00:20:00,230
Scott: Maybe there's rumors of an SSH client, but it has to be in there already.

303
00:20:00,411 --> 00:20:02,118
Rym: Yeah, if it's not already in there, I'm selling putty.

304
00:20:02,138 --> 00:20:02,319
Scott: right.

305
00:20:02,339 --> 00:20:04,609
Scott: but I mean don't install putty until the moment you're about to SSH.

306
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:07,803
Rym: I'm gonna need buddy to an SSH like that day.

307
00:20:07,884 --> 00:20:11,980
Scott: most like right, but don't do it Immediately do it the later in the day when you do it.

308
00:20:12,261 --> 00:20:14,028
Rym: Yeah, I know I'm gonna need it.

309
00:20:14,048 --> 00:20:14,350
Rym: It's a good.

310
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:27,590
Scott: It's a good strategy Trust me because then you basically if what happens is even if you get it perfectly right and you only install the programs You're actually used as you made a list and you know what you know, you wrote track your usage or something, right?

311
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:30,309
Scott: What happens is when you do that initial setup?

312
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:35,707
Scott: You're gonna spend a whole bunch of time installing all these programs and it's gonna take like an hour.

313
00:20:35,808 --> 00:20:40,646
Scott: if you just wait It'll still spread out those installs over a day or even a week.

314
00:20:40,847 --> 00:20:46,728
Rym: the one trouble is Like some games take like two hours to install.

315
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:49,048
Scott: well good Don't waste those two hours unless you're actually gonna play.

316
00:20:49,068 --> 00:20:52,429
Rym: well No, you start them and then they go in the background if you know, you're gonna play it.

317
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:54,983
Scott: Yeah, counter-strike is probably a safe bet for you.

318
00:20:55,084 --> 00:21:00,430
Rym: Yeah counter-strike said five Necrodancer actually because now this is done and playing the shit out of that game.

319
00:21:02,308 --> 00:21:03,193
Rym: So Yeah, there's.

320
00:21:03,233 --> 00:21:05,301
Scott: that's what you got to know about Windows 10 update.

321
00:21:05,442 --> 00:21:07,490
Rym: and there are two news is about Windows 10 that are very important.

322
00:21:07,752 --> 00:21:15,121
Rym: One Windows 10. if you have the home edition Windows updates will be automatic and mandatory.

323
00:21:15,161 --> 00:21:16,084
Rym: You cannot defer them.

324
00:21:16,104 --> 00:21:16,947
Rym: You cannot pause them.

325
00:21:16,987 --> 00:21:17,730
Rym: You cannot undo them.

326
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,816
Rym: You're gonna just reboot.

327
00:21:19,158 --> 00:21:20,265
Scott: fuck you as far as I know.

328
00:21:20,305 --> 00:21:21,070
Scott: That's a good thing.

329
00:21:21,412 --> 00:21:24,050
Scott: I a lot of people do not do Windows updates and then they get fucked.

330
00:21:24,251 --> 00:21:34,110
Rym: I have zero problem with this because one If you're using Windows home and This bother chrome updates see chrome updates this way and no one gives a shit.

331
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:42,770
Scott: But when other things, you know make you manually update and they try to go become the chrome model people complain And it's like how come you're not complaining about chrome?

332
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,430
Scott: They already do this even better.

333
00:21:44,651 --> 00:21:51,413
Rym: The the most common complaint is I have a special snowflake use case where my production system, whatever Yeah, I Pro.

334
00:21:51,554 --> 00:21:55,810
Rym: if yeah, if you buy Windows Pro then you have that capability.

335
00:21:56,111 --> 00:22:03,438
Scott: I mean I have I assume because I have Windows 7 Pro on my desktop that I'm gonna get Pro on that desktop and my Others have home premium.

336
00:22:03,459 --> 00:22:04,929
Scott: So I assume they're gonna get home.

337
00:22:05,512 --> 00:22:07,059
Scott: So I'm probably on the pro.

338
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:09,610
Scott: I'm gonna turn on the auto updates cuz I update everything anyway.

339
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:15,770
Rym: Yeah, so Windows 10 Pro you can delay them, but you cannot actually prevent them, but that's fine.

340
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:16,866
Rym: That's what you should be doing.

341
00:22:16,906 --> 00:22:17,109
Scott: fine.

342
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:23,032
Scott: Also, and if your complaint is but I'm an enterprise as long as we start my computer while I'm using it I don't give a shit.

343
00:22:23,173 --> 00:22:24,979
Rym: Yeah, so pay for Pro if you don't want that to happen.

344
00:22:24,999 --> 00:22:30,530
Rym: and If you need like lockdown control of a bunch of other people's Windows computers, you could already do that.

345
00:22:30,677 --> 00:22:33,570
Rym: Yeah The enterprise Windows crap will do the same thing.

346
00:22:34,511 --> 00:22:40,248
Rym: Doing that since like Windows 95 and T days so you can still stage your production updates into a UAT environment.

347
00:22:40,268 --> 00:22:40,870
Rym: You really need to.

348
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:47,970
Rym: now Pretty much everyone complaining about this is super butter for no good reason.

349
00:22:48,151 --> 00:22:53,650
Rym: So I defy anyone to give us a an actually legitimate good reason.

350
00:22:54,392 --> 00:23:03,588
Rym: The only one I can see at all is that some people are worried that Microsoft might at some point Remove functionality or lock things down in a way that you can't prevent.

351
00:23:03,608 --> 00:23:04,090
Scott: All right, fine.

352
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:06,010
Scott: Well, it's not like I've bought a new PC recently.

353
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:09,321
Scott: so if something if Windows 10 fucks me over.

354
00:23:09,481 --> 00:23:13,769
Scott: I can always go back to Windows 7 and I can always go run Linux.

355
00:23:14,111 --> 00:23:15,475
Scott: So my computers aren't useless.

356
00:23:15,696 --> 00:23:19,087
Scott: cuz remember and I'll just buy Macs the next time I need a computer.

357
00:23:19,367 --> 00:23:20,110
Rym: all the you know.

358
00:23:20,631 --> 00:23:34,350
Rym: Back in the 90s when there was real fear of like government crackdowns on internet free speech and oh, you know The CBD tPA type stuff there was a renaissance of people preparing to run alternative systems.

359
00:23:35,014 --> 00:23:37,029
Rym: We're not really in real danger of that right now.

360
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:45,750
Rym: And if danger of that appeared like if CBD tPA like shit Started coming down the pipe and windows all the smart nerds would bail faster than you could blink.

361
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:56,046
Rym: Something would appear that started working and then all the not as well-versed and computers people would be able to Stand on their shoulders and use the stuff they put together.

362
00:23:56,066 --> 00:23:56,449
Rym: Mm-hmm.

363
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,275
Rym: So I'm not too worried about.

364
00:23:58,716 --> 00:24:03,030
Rym: I'm not worried about NATO FEMA death camps coming in with the windows updates.

365
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:03,411
Rym: It's what I'm.

366
00:24:03,511 --> 00:24:07,344
Scott: also enough money would divert to alternative platforms, right?

367
00:24:07,384 --> 00:24:09,169
Scott: Like, you know Chromebooks still out there.

368
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:20,799
Rym: Things of the day.

369
00:24:21,661 --> 00:24:26,420
Rym: So this is the red wall and not nice with the swords not the mice with the swords.

370
00:24:26,722 --> 00:24:32,856
Rym: So there's this wall here and this wall This is a photo gallery had just a area that was painted red.

371
00:24:32,876 --> 00:24:33,800
Rym: The rest of it wasn't painted.

372
00:24:33,981 --> 00:24:35,546
Scott: It's who did that and why.

373
00:24:35,567 --> 00:24:36,912
Rym: uh, that was the question.

374
00:24:37,173 --> 00:24:42,427
Rym: So the red area got covered in graffiti and They kept covering graffiti up with red.

375
00:24:42,809 --> 00:24:45,720
Rym: So a guy went and spray-painted the word red there.

376
00:24:46,141 --> 00:24:47,125
Scott: Oh, is it like an issue?

377
00:24:47,186 --> 00:24:48,029
Scott: Is that why it's red?

378
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:50,860
Scott: originally to cover up a graffiti that probably couldn't clean.

379
00:24:51,121 --> 00:24:52,869
Rym: So that was interesting as a brick wall.

380
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:59,271
Rym: So then more graffiti appeared and Then they painted it with a different shade of red that looked like shit.

381
00:24:59,572 --> 00:25:01,840
Rym: Okay, so they have this splotchy red covering the new graffiti.

382
00:25:02,302 --> 00:25:03,568
Rym: So the guy was like, huh?

383
00:25:04,191 --> 00:25:06,140
Rym: So he painted the word red somewhere different.

384
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:11,440
Scott: There must be an old person who lives nearby who's calling three one one to get the graffiti removers to do something.

385
00:25:11,661 --> 00:25:12,967
Scott: So sure enough is New York, right?

386
00:25:12,988 --> 00:25:13,611
Scott: It looks like New York.

387
00:25:13,751 --> 00:25:14,756
Rym: I don't actually know where it is.

388
00:25:14,957 --> 00:25:15,480
Scott: Looks in New York.

389
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:28,705
Rym: So he does it again Does it again, so he just keeps painting the word red and they keep painting this darker red until eventually Red question mark he typed.

390
00:25:28,745 --> 00:25:33,998
Rym: he paints red with a question mark in black above the red paint on the regular bricks.

391
00:25:34,459 --> 00:25:37,091
Rym: Mmm So they power washed it.

392
00:25:37,232 --> 00:25:38,600
Scott: Yeah instead of spraying.

393
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:41,812
Rym: So if it's on the red paint they painted a different red.

394
00:25:41,892 --> 00:25:43,960
Rym: if it's not on the red paint they power wash it.

395
00:25:44,441 --> 00:25:48,691
Rym: So then he wrote pressure wash on the hair and paint red to see what they do.

396
00:25:48,711 --> 00:25:51,337
Rym: Mm-hmm, and they painted it red.

397
00:25:51,357 --> 00:25:54,443
Scott: Yeah About this.

398
00:25:54,664 --> 00:25:57,335
Rym: Well, so you can you can find then the right extended.

399
00:25:57,456 --> 00:25:59,742
Scott: Whoa It was too much red.

400
00:26:00,023 --> 00:26:01,185
Rym: You went above the line.

401
00:26:01,246 --> 00:26:08,119
Rym: So he started painting in other places and Eventually the entire thing gets painted red and it's done.

402
00:26:10,213 --> 00:26:15,100
Rym: So This is super funny and I didn't 100% verify that I catch this person.

403
00:26:15,381 --> 00:26:16,926
Scott: It's painting the same place over and over again.

404
00:26:16,946 --> 00:26:21,560
Scott: You think aha the same person is doing graffiti repeatedly in the same plot.

405
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,529
Rym: Wait, wait Scott, you're asking that question.

406
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,257
Scott: put up one crappy camera.

407
00:26:25,277 --> 00:26:25,920
Scott: You'll catch them.

408
00:26:26,321 --> 00:26:28,268
Rym: We know people who's by.

409
00:26:28,369 --> 00:26:38,060
Rym: we know a person a good friend who's bike was stolen in New York Who found her bike on Craigslist like the next day for sale at an address down the street?

410
00:26:38,341 --> 00:26:39,464
Rym: There is zero doubt.

411
00:26:39,504 --> 00:26:46,484
Rym: It was her bike and the cops literally gave zero fucks and said don't worry about it Don't call us for this shit.

412
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:50,457
Scott: So be a law that they have to do something and you can sue them if they don't.

413
00:26:50,538 --> 00:26:51,120
Rym: maybe yeah.

414
00:26:51,926 --> 00:26:53,360
Rym: So yeah, this is just super entertaining.

415
00:26:53,601 --> 00:26:55,670
Scott: I mean you could you maybe even could sue the cops.

416
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:57,800
Scott: you know many lawsuits the New York Police Department gets.

417
00:26:57,981 --> 00:27:01,280
Scott: Maybe maybe they'll just say yeah, they pay a lot of money out.

418
00:27:01,481 --> 00:27:04,918
Scott: Our tax money is paid to a lot of lawsuits against the cops every year.

419
00:27:06,801 --> 00:27:07,765
Rym: Anyway, you got a thing of the day.

420
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:08,688
Scott: I do so.

421
00:27:08,708 --> 00:27:12,945
Scott: this is actually it not, you know, it's a technology thing Right related to my works.

422
00:27:13,468 --> 00:27:16,240
Scott: I mean the kind of work that I do which is making websites.

423
00:27:17,022 --> 00:27:31,040
Scott: So an issue with websites these days is that the thing people really want to do with websites the most especially new ones is They want the websites to be real time Not real time in the way that you know, I'm operating system token bus, right?

424
00:27:31,322 --> 00:27:34,020
Scott: People don't know a real-time program, you know.

425
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:41,240
Scott: Like serious real time is for things that need to happen in software within a real amount of time.

426
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:45,013
Scott: For example, the best example people always use is the pacemaker.

427
00:27:45,254 --> 00:27:51,223
Scott: if I'm writing software for a pacemaker It has to figure out when to beat in Time to beat.

428
00:27:51,765 --> 00:27:56,158
Scott: if it takes 10 minutes to figure out the rate at which it should beat the person is dead.

429
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:02,500
Rym: now You can't make super fast systems that are real-time because it's actually really hard to make real-time systems, right?

430
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,960
Scott: It's a real real-time systems.

431
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,566
Scott: It's like this has to do.

432
00:28:05,626 --> 00:28:09,280
Scott: it's computing within an amount of real time.

433
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:12,872
Scott: This must do all this math within three seconds.

434
00:28:12,992 --> 00:28:14,116
Scott: Otherwise, it's not gonna have.

435
00:28:14,136 --> 00:28:18,136
Rym: so in think that's a real-time Deterministic processing times and latency, right?

436
00:28:18,156 --> 00:28:18,880
Scott: That's real time.

437
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:25,580
Scott: So the not real time is almost all computing which is the CPU does it as fast as it can.

438
00:28:25,901 --> 00:28:30,340
Rym: So you're talking a site like yeah, I need my game my gauges to be moving around, right?

439
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:42,726
Scott: So when people talk about real-time web what they're talking about is basically Sort of using a TCP IP like push/pull over HTTP web sockets.

440
00:28:42,827 --> 00:28:47,600
Scott: exactly right you visit a website, but you know you edit, you know.

441
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:55,253
Scott: Normally when you're good to a website you fill out a form you push submit or post it makes a post Database gets updated then data comes back.

442
00:28:55,695 --> 00:28:56,720
Scott: a real-time website.

443
00:28:57,342 --> 00:29:13,590
Scott: For example, you'd be editing your comment and every time you backspace it backspaces and every time you know And everyone else can see this like, you know Google Drive Google Docs where you edit a doc and everyone can see that doc editing and you can see the doc edited by other people And it happens as soon as you type.

444
00:29:14,134 --> 00:29:15,160
Scott: That's a real-time web.

445
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:21,003
Rym: That's a lot of what I'm actually having built right now and Mike I need I'm making I'm basically getting rid old swing clients Making these real-time.

446
00:29:21,144 --> 00:29:29,388
Scott: well most of the web frameworks the popular ones out there like Django which I use and Ruby which Ron rails Which a lot of people use said embers pretty good.

447
00:29:29,509 --> 00:29:30,814
Scott: He's amber is a different thing.

448
00:29:30,834 --> 00:29:31,898
Scott: That's a front-end thingy.

449
00:29:31,998 --> 00:29:34,615
Rym: So These you're saying like the full.

450
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:36,122
Scott: yeah I'm at the back end.

451
00:29:36,142 --> 00:29:38,308
Scott: web frameworks these days that are really popular.

452
00:29:38,769 --> 00:29:46,739
Scott: right our bay based on the model of you know Request server renders a response and sends it.

453
00:29:47,342 --> 00:29:54,200
Scott: They're not really built for the real-time web and in order to be built for the real-time web You need like a fundamentally different sort of setup.

454
00:29:54,922 --> 00:30:07,940
Scott: Alright, and the big problem is that even if you were to make a real-time front-end, you know For your application right you use an ember or you know angular or some kind of JavaScript the back-end.

455
00:30:09,021 --> 00:30:15,420
Scott: You set up web sockets and you set up some sort of API a restful API with a web socket connection that gives live updates.

456
00:30:16,082 --> 00:30:19,355
Scott: Behind that the database is not really real-time.

457
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:21,823
Scott: You need some kind of weirdo Database.

458
00:30:21,844 --> 00:30:26,466
Scott: you can't just use a normal relational database because an SQL query how are you gonna know?

459
00:30:26,787 --> 00:30:32,967
Scott: say Rym visits the website and he updates the Google Doc and In it through the web socket connection.

460
00:30:33,509 --> 00:30:35,114
Scott: So rims connection to the.

461
00:30:35,214 --> 00:30:36,840
Scott: a web server writes to the database.

462
00:30:37,688 --> 00:30:38,839
Scott: How does my?

463
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:42,072
Scott: You know connection to the web socket application.

464
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:43,720
Scott: know the database got updated.

465
00:30:44,423 --> 00:30:49,040
Scott: Are the are all the different, you know, all the web servers communicating with each other sideways.

466
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:50,900
Scott: Then how do you scale out these web servers?

467
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,665
Rym: Is that what was the database like?

468
00:30:52,926 --> 00:30:56,820
Rym: call a stored procedure that dumps something on a queue that goes out to like?

469
00:30:57,641 --> 00:31:02,580
Scott: This guy in Python only right pretty much all you know this thing.

470
00:31:03,381 --> 00:31:04,727
Scott: Writing only in Python.

471
00:31:04,748 --> 00:31:06,556
Rym: I forgot you showed me this video, right?

472
00:31:06,696 --> 00:31:14,342
Scott: He sets up using Postgres in Python this exact thing and his code is so Right.

473
00:31:14,382 --> 00:31:22,980
Scott: He basically every view every URL in his API is a class that has four methods get put post and web socket, right.

474
00:31:23,562 --> 00:31:24,605
Scott: So he's.

475
00:31:24,685 --> 00:31:34,340
Scott: it's like, you know, he uses work Zoe and some other things that you know, you might not know about To just establish web sockets really easily and then and Postgres.

476
00:31:34,942 --> 00:31:38,796
Scott: He's just using a normal old Postgres connection, which is just a relational database.

477
00:31:39,016 --> 00:31:40,080
Rym: Like it's not right.

478
00:31:40,221 --> 00:31:42,509
Rym: It's not any of this modern like no sequel nonsense.

479
00:31:42,569 --> 00:31:44,636
Rym: It's a relational straight-up like select.

480
00:31:44,817 --> 00:31:53,347
Scott: He sets up Basically a trigger to say aha whenever this table is updated Publish a notification here.

481
00:31:53,969 --> 00:31:55,816
Rym: What's he using to publish Postgres?

482
00:31:56,439 --> 00:32:02,840
Scott: Oh These features to do this and he shows you how to set it up to where the application will be notified.

483
00:32:03,001 --> 00:32:05,700
Scott: So Rym on his connects to the app of the web socket.

484
00:32:06,342 --> 00:32:08,228
Scott: He put he sends over some info.

485
00:32:08,569 --> 00:32:14,949
Scott: he updates the Google Doc it gets saved to the database with an update statement The database that has the trigger database or triggers.

486
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:17,778
Scott: So now over my website connection it goes.

487
00:32:17,979 --> 00:32:24,928
Scott: Hey Yeah This just changed poop and now my will update my browser Immediately as soon as Rym does his thing.

488
00:32:25,269 --> 00:32:31,490
Scott: and this is the exact technology you could use to make say The a jack like game like we discussed last week.

489
00:32:31,531 --> 00:32:32,213
Rym: This is a nice.

490
00:32:32,273 --> 00:32:34,360
Scott: This is a young person and this is coded.

491
00:32:35,301 --> 00:32:47,460
Rym: So, well, this is like a young person simply because like I said that the kind of cruftier way to do that is to use Like JMS cues and things that are triggered from internal database using only Python and Postgres and then it's up to you.

492
00:32:48,023 --> 00:32:51,060
Scott: I mean all it results in is a restful API with a website connection.

493
00:32:51,502 --> 00:33:06,007
Scott: So it's up to you on the front end using JavaScript and some JavaScript framework of your choice Which could be anything because it's just a normal old restful API, you know You can use your embers your angulars your reacts your whatever you like To connect to this and make an application out of it.

494
00:33:06,207 --> 00:33:14,783
Scott: All right, so I think this is a really good example of The way of making ultra modern, you know Websites.

495
00:33:14,843 --> 00:33:21,117
Scott: if you're gonna make a brand new web applications today, you should make it this way and you'll be future-proof for a good long time.

496
00:33:22,161 --> 00:33:26,280
Rym: So our main topic things going away things disappearing because I didn't do a meta moment.

497
00:33:26,461 --> 00:33:28,970
Rym: All right, the meta moment the booklet book is the wheel of time.

498
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:30,074
Rym: It just keeps on turning.

499
00:33:30,094 --> 00:33:31,640
Scott: I'm getting along.

500
00:33:31,841 --> 00:33:32,764
Rym: I'm getting along too.

501
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:34,732
Scott: They're uh, they're all party split up.

502
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:36,820
Rym: One of them's a werewolf, I guess.

503
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,205
Scott: Yeah, I ever got to that part.

504
00:33:38,486 --> 00:33:38,807
Rym: Oh, wow.

505
00:33:38,827 --> 00:33:39,850
Rym: Yeah, you caught up mostly.

506
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:43,202
Rym: Okay, so they're in fact, we just met the tinkers That's right.

507
00:33:43,222 --> 00:33:43,946
Scott: I got met them too.

508
00:33:44,107 --> 00:33:44,308
Scott: Yep.

509
00:33:44,549 --> 00:33:46,519
Rym: So we're about the same point unless you got past the tinkers.

510
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:48,461
Scott: Maybe.

511
00:33:48,782 --> 00:33:49,425
Scott: yeah, I don't know.

512
00:33:49,525 --> 00:33:50,589
Rym: I'm pretty much in the middle.

513
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:51,654
Rym: Oh, it's about where I am.

514
00:33:51,895 --> 00:33:53,039
Rym: All right, we're about the same point then.

515
00:33:54,161 --> 00:33:55,347
Rym: Problem is super nice out.

516
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,720
Rym: I only read a bunch today because I had a subway commute.

517
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:02,787
Scott: Hopefully I won't have that commute the rest of the week since I lost my iPad died And I'm not gonna get a new one for a while.

518
00:34:02,808 --> 00:34:05,320
Scott: I am doing only reading once I'm in bed.

519
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,062
Scott: That's a new rule.

520
00:34:06,082 --> 00:34:10,478
Rym: Oh, so yeah, you could buy the iPad Pro that's rumored to be coming.

521
00:34:10,538 --> 00:34:11,020
Scott: Maybe I will.

522
00:34:11,301 --> 00:34:12,225
Scott: Well, you see what it is.

523
00:34:12,607 --> 00:34:15,440
Rym: So the rumor is that it's just a gigantic iPad.

524
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,264
Scott: How big could it be?

525
00:34:16,324 --> 00:34:16,688
Scott: is a bit.

526
00:34:16,748 --> 00:34:18,619
Scott: if it's too big for my messenger bag, then it's too bad.

527
00:34:19,022 --> 00:34:21,239
Rym: It looks like it's as big as the screen on a MacBook Pro.

528
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,466
Rym: Maybe yeah, I don't know.

529
00:34:24,888 --> 00:34:26,536
Scott: I had to go to the Apple store and check it out.

530
00:34:26,637 --> 00:34:27,940
Rym: Yeah, it's like Cuz.

531
00:34:27,981 --> 00:34:33,239
Scott: I mean I had the you know, the mini iPad and I really like that and it was perfectly big enough.

532
00:34:33,301 --> 00:34:35,319
Scott: But I was kind of thinking about getting the normal size one.

533
00:34:35,652 --> 00:34:36,222
Rym: Yeah Because I don't.

534
00:34:36,242 --> 00:34:41,523
Scott: but if there's a pro one if it's like even harder better faster stronger in addition to being big But it's not too big.

535
00:34:41,543 --> 00:34:48,605
Scott: I could I could see that working but I'd be worried like, okay, it's in my messenger bag crack Exactly when it's bigger.

536
00:34:48,725 --> 00:34:52,399
Rym: It's flexier and more, you know, maybe just get the Apple care with it.

537
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,862
Rym: Maybe the good thing is I need you know by how much is it gonna cost - if it's $2,000 It's my.

538
00:34:57,983 --> 00:35:01,940
Rym: I don't need like that middle ground of like a phablet or a tiny tablet.

539
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:08,955
Rym: Cuz why I buy there's three tiers of things tiny phone Normal size tablet full laptop for doing real work.

540
00:35:09,035 --> 00:35:09,256
Rym: Right?

541
00:35:09,296 --> 00:35:11,384
Rym: Those are my three things I'll probably just get like.

542
00:35:11,424 --> 00:35:14,054
Scott: I guess they'll come out with iPad air 3 probably in mini 4.

543
00:35:14,054 --> 00:35:17,874
Scott: Yeah, whatever they come out with Yeah, I have to see what the deal is good for.

544
00:35:17,914 --> 00:35:21,372
Rym: good for airplanes Even though there's coming rules.

545
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:22,599
Scott: that good for notion of hex.

546
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:36,104
Rym: So if you like if you're traveling and you want to bring your laptop to like use at the destination for like real work And you also bring your iPad there's a good chance that the rules are gonna change and you cannot check Laptops period.

547
00:35:36,125 --> 00:35:37,508
Rym: you have to bring them in carry-on.

548
00:35:37,729 --> 00:35:41,600
Rym: All right, so you'll have to bring your laptop and your tablet through security.

549
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:42,846
Rym: You can't check one of them.

550
00:35:42,866 --> 00:35:45,056
Rym: All right, that's very likely to ever check.

551
00:35:45,097 --> 00:35:47,769
Scott: I don't check any Electronics anyway, cuz I don't trust that shit.

552
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:49,097
Rym: I checked most of my electronics.

553
00:35:49,157 --> 00:35:49,580
Scott: a will steal.

554
00:35:49,641 --> 00:35:50,710
Scott: It won't be there when you get there.

555
00:35:50,771 --> 00:35:51,638
Rym: It's never happened to me.

556
00:35:52,081 --> 00:35:54,512
Scott: I mean, I'll check like wires and chargers and that sort of.

557
00:35:54,572 --> 00:35:56,480
Rym: I check them or answers that check my cameras.

558
00:35:57,044 --> 00:35:58,031
Scott: Yeah, I don't check the camera.

559
00:35:58,313 --> 00:35:59,360
Rym: I would not check the Mackie.

560
00:36:00,322 --> 00:36:00,523
Rym: I would.

561
00:36:00,603 --> 00:36:03,880
Rym: I would package this up in a box and bring it special anyway.

562
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:12,938
Scott: Anyway, or at least I would carry through security and then once you get you can be like, alright put this in the check Like a stroller, you know when people have babies they do that thing.

563
00:36:14,343 --> 00:36:16,260
Rym: We should have a stroller with all our audio equipment.

564
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:23,120
Scott: One other meta news beside, you know, two other meta news is a meta news number one - because we already the book club.

565
00:36:23,243 --> 00:36:26,871
Scott: Yep Pax is way soon Pax Prime.

566
00:36:27,091 --> 00:36:27,994
Rym: We're gonna be there.

567
00:36:28,255 --> 00:36:32,313
Rym: Scott will be there for four days You know, you'll be there for six days.

568
00:36:32,936 --> 00:36:39,255
Scott: It's Pax The packs the convention that puts all of the conventions behind it the packs.

569
00:36:39,355 --> 00:36:51,466
Rym: Yep, and it's interesting because Across the board based on a couple conventions that I noticed this happen and then I started asking around and it's a pretty Not worrying but interesting trend.

570
00:36:51,486 --> 00:36:56,420
Rym: a lot of fan conventions in 2015 had significantly lower attendance.

571
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,283
Scott: But not Pax.

572
00:36:57,323 --> 00:36:59,429
Scott: Pax sells out boom every time.

573
00:36:59,489 --> 00:37:01,335
Scott: Yep, Pax sold out even faster.

574
00:37:01,355 --> 00:37:02,900
Scott: Pax on the rise, other cons going down.

575
00:37:02,981 --> 00:37:03,747
Scott: What does that tell you?

576
00:37:04,171 --> 00:37:06,464
Rym: So, uh, yeah We're gonna be there far.

577
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:10,860
Rym: future of gaming on Sunday and sports are games very topical now.

578
00:37:11,021 --> 00:37:12,573
Scott: I'm gonna start working on that right now.

579
00:37:12,694 --> 00:37:13,500
Rym: you start working on that.

580
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,110
Rym: I'll start working on the far future one in earnest.

581
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,358
Scott: a bunch of questions for that one.

582
00:37:16,439 --> 00:37:28,420
Rym: Yep Well, no what I need to do because I what I wanted to do at magfest But we ended up not doing for various reasons is if we're talking about like 30 years in the future 40 years in the future a lot of a slide for each one of these things.

583
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,875
Rym: That's like here's the state of this thing 30 years ago.

584
00:37:32,382 --> 00:37:36,880
Rym: So you can see like wow, we came from that to today in that span of time.

585
00:37:37,222 --> 00:37:39,919
Rym: What's that distance into the future of stuff?

586
00:37:40,821 --> 00:37:44,460
Scott: Anyway, so the final meta moment is that we have a lot of things on the internet.

587
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:48,860
Scott: I mean if you already listen to this podcast, you probably found us on the internet in a bunch of places.

588
00:37:49,021 --> 00:37:50,811
Rym: But we are in your pro mode already.

589
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:54,608
Rym: Most people find our other things I never find but we're in the internet and all the places.

590
00:37:54,668 --> 00:37:58,869
Scott: I saw a bunch of like we've received like a more Facebook likes in this week.

591
00:37:59,375 --> 00:38:05,031
Scott: then Yeah, we got like four or five likes on Facebook at the whole in this week Which is usually as many as you get in a month.

592
00:38:05,757 --> 00:38:09,110
Scott: So You should find us if we're is a place on the internet.

593
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:10,637
Scott: we even have a reddit that's unused.

594
00:38:10,918 --> 00:38:12,622
Rym: Yeah Subreddit.

595
00:38:12,642 --> 00:38:15,513
Rym: the last post was me saying wow, we still we have a reddit.

596
00:38:15,774 --> 00:38:17,099
Rym: Yeah, I didn't even know Scott made this.

597
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,206
Scott: We have a subreddit.

598
00:38:18,227 --> 00:38:20,060
Scott: We've got Google+ we got Facebook.

599
00:38:23,363 --> 00:38:26,679
Scott: We got so much places on the internet that have our stuff on them.

600
00:38:27,161 --> 00:38:31,095
Scott: You should go and make sure whichever place that you use you got a tumblr Rym.

601
00:38:31,115 --> 00:38:40,037
Scott: stop doing and I'm gonna start it up Actually because I'm going to put some content out soon that we got a newsletter They haven't written in months that I haven't forgotten about.

602
00:38:40,158 --> 00:38:42,552
Rym: in fact I'm gonna make sure I don't shit talk on this.

603
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:49,140
Rym: what I'm putting together is, you know We run the panels and workshops department at Connecticut which happened, you know a couple weeks ago and was super awesome.

604
00:38:50,123 --> 00:38:59,760
Rym: it was the best year for panels pretty much ever and We have all the data on the exact number of people who went to every panel and a whole host all the panels.

605
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:04,100
Rym: Yeah, we missed a few so I was actually able to backfill in the head.

606
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:12,374
Rym: We only missed like seven because people didn't fill them out and by asking around people Remembered enough to arrive reasonable estimates to fill in those few holes.

607
00:39:12,997 --> 00:39:13,780
Rym: There's two panels.

608
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,548
Rym: I have no idea how many people went to.

609
00:39:15,568 --> 00:39:19,727
Rym: I'm thinking about emailing the panelists and Trying to ask them without them.

610
00:39:19,787 --> 00:39:22,319
Rym: You're like 108 whatever the size of the room was.

611
00:39:24,761 --> 00:39:32,487
Rym: But I'm going to publish that data to a depth that I have never published it before and Take that every other count.

612
00:39:32,507 --> 00:39:33,795
Rym: who doesn't do anything with that data?

613
00:39:33,875 --> 00:39:37,034
Rym: if they even collect it It'd be of great interest to very few people.

614
00:39:37,336 --> 00:39:44,480
Scott: Yep But yeah, go and follow us and all the internet places that you use whatever you like and maybe also share.

615
00:39:45,421 --> 00:39:56,610
Scott: I don't want to tell people to share but I mean you can share our stuff because You know if we did something that you like, you know, it doesn't hurt to share most in the red.

616
00:39:56,731 --> 00:39:59,494
Scott: I mean I share all your shit When you tell me to.

617
00:39:59,575 --> 00:40:01,020
Scott: so this is why I usually don't tell you to.

618
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,209
Scott: but apparently telling people to do this works.

619
00:40:03,791 --> 00:40:05,624
Rym: I guess yeah on me.

620
00:40:05,644 --> 00:40:06,390
Scott: I'm the opposite.

621
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:13,997
Rym: I'll put it this way the more you share our shit around and like tell conventions and things like oh get these guys The more we'll actually do like.

622
00:40:14,117 --> 00:40:15,121
Rym: we only do the stuff that we.

623
00:40:15,161 --> 00:40:19,003
Scott: kind of it's like when someone says please rate and subscribe I'm like go fuck yourself.

624
00:40:19,104 --> 00:40:21,849
Scott: Well, if So I don't like to do that.

625
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:26,164
Scott: But apparently those are the people who get the most rates and subscribe.

626
00:40:26,244 --> 00:40:32,503
Rym: if you want another thousand Episodes of GeekNights over 50 not 15 over 10 years.

627
00:40:32,844 --> 00:40:33,967
Scott: It'll just happen.

628
00:40:34,007 --> 00:40:34,729
Rym: We'll just happen.

629
00:40:34,749 --> 00:40:40,071
Rym: but Like a lot of you have been bothering send me money to pay so I don't die I'll do.

630
00:40:40,092 --> 00:40:45,378
Rym: you've been bothering me about the next GeekNights presents utenna and Those come out a lot faster.

631
00:40:45,418 --> 00:40:46,784
Rym: if you guys make us more popular.

632
00:40:46,805 --> 00:40:47,568
Rym: That's true.

633
00:40:47,689 --> 00:40:51,099
Rym: like Faster than you think they'll come out.

634
00:40:52,023 --> 00:40:54,010
Rym: I'm motivated primarily by vainglory.

635
00:40:55,431 --> 00:40:58,563
Scott: I'm motivated by not the things Rym is motivated by.

636
00:40:58,603 --> 00:41:00,490
Rym: what are you motivated by in terms of GeekNights?

637
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:03,830
Rym: I've heard my in my order number one habit one vain.

638
00:41:06,132 --> 00:41:11,360
Rym: Okay vainglory Wanting to eventually make money off of this and not do a normal job.

639
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,085
Scott: boredom on we inhabit.

640
00:41:13,386 --> 00:41:14,228
Rym: Yeah have.

641
00:41:14,269 --> 00:41:16,376
Rym: it's a big part I got to admit have it and on week.

642
00:41:16,477 --> 00:41:21,775
Rym: if you want us to be motivated by another factor and do more content It would take a lot of money.

643
00:41:21,835 --> 00:41:27,515
Scott: You know, I'm not unmotivated by money, but it takes a very large amount of money $380,000 a year.

644
00:41:27,675 --> 00:41:30,745
Rym: We will make GeekNights content 40 hours a week forever.

645
00:41:30,765 --> 00:41:36,103
Rym: I Would do nothing but make you yeah, I would be big but a lot of the content would be.

646
00:41:36,424 --> 00:41:47,958
Rym: here's my bike to the beach But we make it Anyway, so a bunch of this other news all was kind of related Which is why we came with the idea than doing in the show.

647
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,609
Rym: So it's just more tech news, but there's a theme.

648
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:55,183
Rym: Google is blocking access to an API that I didn't know they had.

649
00:41:55,343 --> 00:41:57,809
Rym: I didn't know it because it was an undocumented unofficial.

650
00:41:59,134 --> 00:42:01,250
Scott: How did you even learn about this undocumented API?

651
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:02,437
Scott: Do you just like inspect the?

652
00:42:02,538 --> 00:42:04,350
Scott: you know, Google made an API for themselves?

653
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:10,589
Scott: You must have inspected it figured it out maybe documented it unofficially for other people and then people started using it.

654
00:42:11,332 --> 00:42:12,335
Rym: That seems to be the case.

655
00:42:12,515 --> 00:42:19,561
Rym: Sometimes I've noticed Google and other people will publish info like hey, here's this API But don't rely on it for anything.

656
00:42:19,601 --> 00:42:20,666
Rym: It might change or go away.

657
00:42:20,706 --> 00:42:21,390
Rym: We don't support it.

658
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:29,541
Scott: Well also like I just said if you make a website in the modern way, right the way I just described it The restful API and the web socket someone can just.

659
00:42:29,882 --> 00:42:32,110
Scott: you know, your whole application is JavaScript.

660
00:42:32,612 --> 00:42:43,330
Scott: Someone could just make an alternate JavaScript that for your client for your website for your API You know or they could make it, you know a mobile app that just uses your API and connects to your website.

661
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:44,096
Scott: They figure it out.

662
00:42:44,136 --> 00:42:44,680
Scott: It's not hard.

663
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,829
Scott: It's all public, you know.

664
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:52,030
Scott: Yeah, they can just inspect the packets or if they you know, look at your JavaScript code figure out how your API works.

665
00:42:52,673 --> 00:42:55,710
Rym: So yeah, Google's autocomplete API apparently is a really cool thing.

666
00:42:55,771 --> 00:43:01,076
Rym: I didn't know I could mess around with it But I guess as of August 10th I won't be able to mess around with it anymore.

667
00:43:01,096 --> 00:43:06,756
Rym: and they gave their usual like in the interest of maintaining the integrity of Autocomplete as part of search.

668
00:43:07,218 --> 00:43:22,690
Rym: So what I suspect happened, but they didn't say so I don't know is that some people were probably Fucking around with these either to mine data about how Google's page ranky stuff works or to otherwise do SEO manipulation.

669
00:43:23,053 --> 00:43:25,350
Scott: So they were like or just have autocomplete on their websites.

670
00:43:25,471 --> 00:43:28,090
Scott: That was as good as Google's instead of the crappy one that they have.

671
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:34,538
Rym: Yep, that is my second idea of what's going on, but it turns out they're not just killing that That's the one everyone knew and cared about.

672
00:43:34,879 --> 00:43:37,149
Rym: they're throwing away like 80 of these things.

673
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:40,149
Scott: Well, probably cuz it's not enough users and there's a lot of maintenance to do.

674
00:43:40,611 --> 00:43:45,143
Scott: Yeah, if you ever if you ever logged in like, you know your Google like API.

675
00:43:45,183 --> 00:43:51,143
Scott: you can get a Google like coder developer account And you get this like control panel of API looking at it right here.

676
00:43:51,224 --> 00:43:52,930
Rym: Look at all these API's right.

677
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:57,081
Rym: There's a control panel app engine admin API version 1 beta 4, right?

678
00:43:57,101 --> 00:44:00,350
Scott: There's a Google civic information API, right?

679
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:06,510
Scott: So you basically enable these individually on your account because they all have their own like terms of service agreements for each one.

680
00:44:07,132 --> 00:44:11,449
Scott: and then you can get documentation and start using any one of these or all of them.

681
00:44:11,469 --> 00:44:17,610
Scott: and There's a lot of them and I'm surprised like how many there are they about how many employees at Google are there for each?

682
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:18,333
Scott: one of these things.

683
00:44:18,936 --> 00:44:24,979
Scott: so if one of them is not being used or isn't important or Wasn't you know isn't in this control panel?

684
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:26,745
Scott: You probably shouldn't be using it.

685
00:44:27,367 --> 00:44:28,210
Rym: Oh, no, I read that wrong.

686
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:34,966
Rym: they are just getting rid of that one and There are 80 that are supported and a bunch more that are unsupported.

687
00:44:35,147 --> 00:44:51,030
Rym: Mm-hmm Frankly all the people who are super mad about this If your business relies on using someone else's undocumented API You really have a loose understanding of what it means to have a business.

688
00:44:51,553 --> 00:44:58,175
Scott: Well, I mean so many people use beta unsupported unreleased Production ready stuff right?

689
00:44:58,195 --> 00:44:59,219
Scott: I mean Docker.

690
00:44:59,239 --> 00:45:02,510
Scott: I was you know, I'm trying to learn about Docker because apparently it's the real deal.

691
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:05,100
Scott: It's not you know, it seems to be actually my industry.

692
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,667
Rym: A lot of people are looking at it.

693
00:45:06,747 --> 00:45:08,275
Scott: It's not a fad It's a real deal.

694
00:45:08,295 --> 00:45:10,369
Scott: So I'm learning it right now to be pro at it.

695
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:13,466
Rym: I might ask you questions about it later because I haven't looked at it too much.

696
00:45:13,546 --> 00:45:14,029
Rym: But right.

697
00:45:14,109 --> 00:45:22,010
Scott: so I Was watching some video tutorials and things of that nature and I was some of the earliest ones.

698
00:45:22,272 --> 00:45:27,203
Scott: He's like yeah, Docker is not production ready But some of these companies that you see logos of right here.

699
00:45:27,564 --> 00:45:28,770
Scott: are you all these companies?

700
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:35,830
Scott: You see logos ever using it and some of them are using in production Even though we told him not to and every company was a big major company every single one.

701
00:45:36,131 --> 00:45:40,170
Scott: But the guy who made Docker is standing right there giving this presentation saying it's not production ready.

702
00:45:40,652 --> 00:45:42,440
Scott: Some of these companies are using in production.

703
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:50,519
Rym: It's like what the fuck someone posted actually on Slashed out of all things a Here's here's why you don't use these one.

704
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:53,890
Rym: use Google API service to deploy at customer three.

705
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:56,025
Rym: Wait for it to get cancelled by Google.

706
00:45:56,407 --> 00:46:00,439
Scott: Yes So yeah, this happens a lot in computing right?

707
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,289
Scott: Is there anything that you develop any technology develop always depends on?

708
00:46:05,671 --> 00:46:06,557
Scott: Other people right.

709
00:46:06,577 --> 00:46:21,570
Scott: there is nothing that you can make in computing that depends on no company other than your own or no other body of You know workers technologists unless you are someone like say Intel Intel has.

710
00:46:22,092 --> 00:46:24,582
Scott: They make their own chips and their own fabs.

711
00:46:24,682 --> 00:46:35,204
Rym: Intel relies heavily on Fabrication manufacturing research Technology for a lot of other sources, but I mean tell I mean, they're really low-level.

712
00:46:35,224 --> 00:46:36,910
Scott: they're relying on like silicon mines.

713
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:39,390
Scott: They probably even own the mines for all we know, right?

714
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:43,249
Scott: It's like they have their own C compiler that compiles the micro cut, right?

715
00:46:43,511 --> 00:46:45,158
Scott: They do almost everything.

716
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,670
Scott: They don't rely very much on other people, right?

717
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:48,052
Rym: You know what?

718
00:46:48,072 --> 00:46:51,030
Rym: They probably rely on other people for their internal email?

719
00:46:51,691 --> 00:46:56,880
Scott: probably yeah, like Core product, right, but that's what I'm saying.

720
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:08,190
Rym: A lot of people if your company Pro just is taking a bunch of other people's services and linking them together Then you can be displaced by anyone pretty much.

721
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:10,317
Rym: So the key is you.

722
00:47:10,377 --> 00:47:13,206
Rym: there's always that like the debate and finance always build versus buy.

723
00:47:13,226 --> 00:47:17,301
Rym: like you build something or buy it And the answer I always give people is what's your business?

724
00:47:17,321 --> 00:47:18,626
Rym: Like what's the thing you're selling?

725
00:47:18,947 --> 00:47:19,610
Rym: build that part?

726
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:20,937
Rym: Otherwise, you're not selling anything.

727
00:47:21,178 --> 00:47:23,230
Scott: Yep, and buy everything else.

728
00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:26,028
Scott: Yes, buy every other thing cuz that's not a thing that you do.

729
00:47:26,411 --> 00:47:28,929
Scott: You know, you can put your full efforts towards the thing that you do.

730
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:33,906
Rym: Yeah, don't write an email don't write a web framework to host your competitor.

731
00:47:33,946 --> 00:47:35,250
Scott: They make chips, right?

732
00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:37,803
Scott: So when it comes to chips, we just talked about they.

733
00:47:38,165 --> 00:47:39,150
Scott: that's all the stuff they build.

734
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:42,883
Scott: They build the chips because that's their business but their email they don't have some.

735
00:47:43,344 --> 00:47:48,186
Scott: I hope they don't have some like You know version of it, you know exchange that they made their hope.

736
00:47:48,206 --> 00:47:52,463
Scott: They're just using Exchange or Gmail or send mail or something.

737
00:47:52,583 --> 00:47:52,844
Scott: Yep.

738
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:55,193
Rym: I Mean, we're professionals.

739
00:47:55,554 --> 00:48:01,730
Rym: even we back when we had unlimited free time spent a couple months making squirrel mail work with their own mail server.

740
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:04,861
Scott: They were like fuck this that's when Gmail wouldn't work with your domain.

741
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:05,444
Scott: Yeah.

742
00:48:05,624 --> 00:48:07,150
Rym: Anyway, those are bad old days.

743
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:26,121
Scott: Yeah this you know this happens so often in the world of computing where something you use or something you rely on that is made by someone else is end-of-life cancelled deprecated just immediately turned off for whatever reason Right, and there's so many different scenarios that you have to deal with.

744
00:48:26,422 --> 00:48:29,590
Scott: but you also many times you said we expect it in advance.

745
00:48:30,732 --> 00:48:34,473
Rym: Well, not even just if you don't expect it at least Anticipated.

746
00:48:34,513 --> 00:48:37,469
Rym: and they are kind of different things like for example the US military, right?

747
00:48:38,011 --> 00:48:45,399
Rym: we have a plan for what if Canada invades and Mexico nukes, Texas, like what would we do?

748
00:48:45,419 --> 00:48:58,733
Rym: We have like we have these plans for every ridiculous ridiculous Yeah, but you don't need ridiculous No But I'm saying they have people whose job it is to take a weird scenario and just as an exercise examine like alright What would we do?

749
00:48:58,753 --> 00:49:04,830
Rym: and obviously like the low-ranking dude or the intern is working on the Mexico nukes us plan.

750
00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:10,870
Rym: But the smart people who actually like matter are looking at the what if Russia for real invades the rest of Ukraine?

751
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:17,535
Rym: like, you know, we have a plan that will just enact if you're a company or Just a hobbyist.

752
00:49:17,877 --> 00:49:26,930
Rym: You should at least have an idea even if you don't come with a plan At least have a list somewhere that says here are the things that if they change or go away could fuck us.

753
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:29,570
Rym: So at least you got it in the back of your head, right?

754
00:49:29,610 --> 00:49:33,390
Scott: So here's some basic strategies right for dealing with these sorts of situations, right?

755
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:40,781
Scott: So the first situation you have to worry about is the end of lifing situation Which is where they're moving on from one thing to another.

756
00:49:40,861 --> 00:49:45,301
Scott: thing has become the hot new deal like Java 7 is and they're not.

757
00:49:45,321 --> 00:49:46,810
Scott: they're not supporting the old one.

758
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:53,410
Scott: So for example Windows XP right you can still use Windows XP, but Microsoft doesn't putting patches out anymore for it.

759
00:49:53,470 --> 00:49:55,285
Scott: You can't call them up and get tech support for it.

760
00:49:55,386 --> 00:49:58,579
Scott: It's dead But you can still run it if you want.

761
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:02,776
Scott: So if your application only runs on Windows XP You're kind of hosed.

762
00:50:03,078 --> 00:50:08,290
Rym: so, you know, it's like it's like buying a used car Like you can't like you get to the point where you're not gonna get any more warranty support.

763
00:50:08,651 --> 00:50:11,202
Rym: You're on your own, but it'll keep working forever.

764
00:50:11,242 --> 00:50:11,403
Scott: Right?

765
00:50:11,584 --> 00:50:13,090
Scott: So in these situations, right?

766
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:14,403
Scott: There's a few things you can do.

767
00:50:14,464 --> 00:50:19,170
Scott: number one You can figure out if it's possible that you could just keep it going on your own right.

768
00:50:19,211 --> 00:50:31,529
Scott: if you go to Windows XP machine in a pretty secure isolated environment and it's really stable and you know that you know One can be attacking it and it isn't really security threats or anything and it works with the application as it is.

769
00:50:32,132 --> 00:50:33,540
Scott: You can just leave it there the same way.

770
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,310
Scott: You can leave your cobalt mainframe running.

771
00:50:35,370 --> 00:50:41,830
Rym: You will still have a long-term problem of eventually computer hardware that it'll run on might not exist.

772
00:50:42,012 --> 00:50:42,597
Scott: That is true.

773
00:50:42,919 --> 00:50:47,270
Rym: Like you really expect Windows one to run on a mod

774
00:50:47,473 --> 00:50:56,050
Scott: You might not be able to you know If that if this RAM in that computer dies and it's a PC 100 RAM or something You might not be able to get a PC 100

775
00:50:56,050 --> 00:51:02,719
Rym: Mitigate that you stock up in that shit now and you have a little mini warehouse of your own That you know to keep going another 50 years.

776
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,425
Rym: sure thing like that's for real.

777
00:51:04,465 --> 00:51:04,646
Rym: That's.

778
00:51:04,726 --> 00:51:05,348
Rym: I was an IBM.

779
00:51:05,388 --> 00:51:06,929
Rym: people do that We had old hardware like that.

780
00:51:06,970 --> 00:51:07,552
Rym: So, you know we did.

781
00:51:07,853 --> 00:51:12,650
Rym: we had like 50 or 60 of this one kind of machine just in a warehouse.

782
00:51:13,072 --> 00:51:14,037
Rym: So that's enough.

783
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:15,383
Rym: if we have not.

784
00:51:15,443 --> 00:51:16,769
Rym: if well we I don't work there anymore.

785
00:51:17,291 --> 00:51:21,926
Scott: Even if all of those don't work you can put to put together working ones and you know what.

786
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:29,897
Rym: by the time CPU from one ran from another if that old system hasn't been replaced by the time all that hardware is gone Well, you know what?

787
00:51:30,321 --> 00:51:31,150
Rym: It's time, right?

788
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:34,596
Scott: The other thing you can do is when things are end-of-life They tell you in advance.

789
00:51:34,677 --> 00:51:36,709
Scott: people knew Windows XP was dying for a long time.

790
00:51:37,112 --> 00:51:38,623
Scott: They announced when things are gonna die.

791
00:51:38,684 --> 00:51:39,510
Scott: so far in advance.

792
00:51:39,657 --> 00:51:50,970
Rym: Yeah Oracle has already talked about when Java 8 is gonna be end-of-life and when Java 9 like they should be Knowing that and being prepared for it when it happens and keeping your shit up to date.

793
00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:51,713
Scott: You've got a lot.

794
00:51:52,055 --> 00:51:53,361
Scott: Windows 7 was out.

795
00:51:53,622 --> 00:51:58,142
Scott: I think when Windows XP died You should have been moving your shit to the other platform by then.

796
00:51:58,162 --> 00:52:00,390
Scott: Yeah, you have time deal with it Okay.

797
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:02,116
Scott: So there's the other problem.

798
00:52:02,557 --> 00:52:08,395
Scott: is the the sudden death the most the worrisome one, which is like yeah Oh you were using this.

799
00:52:08,415 --> 00:52:14,314
Scott: Let's say using a documented Google API and Google just like oh, we're turning off YouTube Yep.

800
00:52:14,435 --> 00:52:18,090
Rym: No, so here's this imagine if Google just shut down Gmail.

801
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:19,034
Rym: that's a better example?

802
00:52:19,114 --> 00:52:21,465
Rym: sure because Gmail is the core.

803
00:52:21,726 --> 00:52:26,450
Rym: like a Lot of big companies use Google platform for mail, right?

804
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:30,740
Scott: Obviously, this is unlikely to happen But if it could it could just say Gmail's off the end.

805
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:38,042
Rym: now the way I look at it for huge things like that The my risk-reward assessment of that risk itself is.

806
00:52:38,082 --> 00:52:45,610
Rym: that was a weird way to phrase that if I'm fucked by it People way bigger than me are fucked so much more that no one will even notice my problem, right?

807
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:47,369
Scott: You don't worry too much about that.

808
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:50,901
Scott: But let's say you use some other email provider that's smaller.

809
00:52:51,222 --> 00:52:53,530
Scott: your ISP's email also unlikely to go.

810
00:52:53,691 --> 00:52:54,495
Scott: But maybe it does.

811
00:52:54,515 --> 00:52:56,928
Scott: maybe your ISP is like yeah, we're not providing email anymore, right?

812
00:52:57,109 --> 00:53:02,189
Scott: Yeah So in either case it's really easy to just back up your stuff in more than one place.

813
00:53:02,269 --> 00:53:02,711
Scott: anything That's.

814
00:53:02,931 --> 00:53:08,790
Scott: remember the easiest thing to do to explain the cloud to other people and yourself is take any sentence where you say the cloud.

815
00:53:08,891 --> 00:53:10,327
Scott: My email is stored in the cloud.

816
00:53:10,831 --> 00:53:13,961
Scott: Replace the cloud with someone else's computer.

817
00:53:14,222 --> 00:53:19,196
Scott: My email is stored and someone else's computer Which means oh shit.

818
00:53:19,457 --> 00:53:20,662
Scott: It's on someone else's computer.

819
00:53:20,682 --> 00:53:21,866
Scott: I don't have a copy of it.

820
00:53:21,946 --> 00:53:23,090
Scott: Also on my computer.

821
00:53:23,653 --> 00:53:25,784
Scott: Download your email archive once in a while.

822
00:53:25,824 --> 00:53:28,137
Scott: You can do it pretty easily It's not a big deal.

823
00:53:28,419 --> 00:53:32,838
Rym: what I'm kind of thinking about doing ever know I gotta have a partner to do it with because I'm gonna have.

824
00:53:32,919 --> 00:53:38,590
Rym: I'm gonna have when I upgrade computers in September - Pretty powerful computers that are pretty rock-solid.

825
00:53:39,353 --> 00:53:43,802
Rym: So I'm thinking about I mean like Drobo's like Daz's and devices can kind of do this.

826
00:53:43,842 --> 00:53:49,009
Rym: you can have two and if they have the same size You can tell them to be basically master master mirror to each other.

827
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:53,230
Rym: So like Scott and I could each buy a Daz or a NAS.

828
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:55,674
Rym: Yes, use that.

829
00:53:55,734 --> 00:53:59,529
Rym: but if we had the same one and we set up some software they would replicate to each other.

830
00:54:00,254 --> 00:54:01,100
Scott: So we're not necessary.

831
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:02,409
Rym: No, but I'm saying you could do something like that.

832
00:54:02,731 --> 00:54:07,590
Rym: I'm thinking about setting that up with two computers just filled with a shit ton of cheapo spinning discs.

833
00:54:08,071 --> 00:54:11,582
Scott: Do whatever you want like DRBD a mode share whatever you mode.

834
00:54:11,703 --> 00:54:13,930
Rym: I forget which ones the asynchronous anyway.

835
00:54:14,561 --> 00:54:27,150
Scott: So yeah If you just back your stuff up in more than one place I have my photos in like five different services and also local storage like there is no way My photo collection could ever be lost if like flicker goes down.

836
00:54:27,310 --> 00:54:32,407
Scott: It's also in like Google+ and Amazon photos and my computer and my NAS.

837
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:33,370
Scott: It's like I'm safe.

838
00:54:33,511 --> 00:54:38,510
Rym: That's kind of why I want to Daz though Cuz it's a pain in the ass to use a lot of those services with things that are stored in multiple places.

839
00:54:38,652 --> 00:54:39,849
Scott: It's really easy for me to do that.

840
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:40,854
Rym: It's not just annoying.

841
00:54:40,934 --> 00:54:44,590
Scott: photos are the easiest thing cuz everyone makes applications that automatically deals with photos.

842
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:49,730
Scott: Yeah to a point but my music is on Amazon and local storage and NAS, right?

843
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:51,019
Scott: It's like I have everything in so many places.

844
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:52,430
Rym: My videos are so much bigger.

845
00:54:52,571 --> 00:54:54,643
Rym: I'm not dumping those in most of the places.

846
00:54:54,723 --> 00:54:55,769
Rym: I archive that anyway.

847
00:54:57,053 --> 00:54:58,390
Scott: See it backups, right?

848
00:54:58,910 --> 00:55:03,079
Scott: but another thing you can do is Make sure you control your DNS.

849
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:09,867
Scott: cuz if Gmail goes down and your email address is at Gmail You just lost your actual email address, even though you backed up your old emails.

850
00:55:09,887 --> 00:55:10,570
Scott: You ain't getting new ones.

851
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:14,204
Rym: Yeah, Scott and I could point front row crew comm at a different place.

852
00:55:14,284 --> 00:55:15,268
Scott: I could set up in 12 hours.

853
00:55:15,831 --> 00:55:21,950
Scott: I could set up a new email server and My email address would remain the same and all new emails would go somewhere else.

854
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:31,690
Scott: So it's important to control your own DNS entries Like if your hosting provider shuts down you can move your DNS and point it at web servers somewhere else Even if you have to host them yourself in your own.

855
00:55:31,851 --> 00:55:38,152
Rym: I've noticed a cool trend just kind of along these lines cuz you probably have if you're a company or something a bunch of internal API's and things.

856
00:55:38,172 --> 00:55:40,117
Rym: Mm-hmm modern systems.

857
00:55:40,678 --> 00:55:44,968
Rym: people stopped versioning API's like well, there's the new version of the API.

858
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:45,669
Rym: get used to it.

859
00:55:46,311 --> 00:55:53,510
Rym: Instead they just spin up another API that has the new features and leave the old one up basically forever.

860
00:55:54,252 --> 00:55:56,720
Scott: Yeah, I see some people do it that way when they have like.

861
00:55:56,961 --> 00:55:59,710
Scott: they rarely make changes to the API and they make big changes.

862
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:03,726
Scott: They do it that way like Twitter's like oh, here's the old Twitter API Facebook.

863
00:56:03,786 --> 00:56:04,810
Scott: I actually did this a lot.

864
00:56:04,850 --> 00:56:16,290
Rym: Here's the old Facebook API and the new one and it's good when you have lots of consumers of the API that are important But over whom you either don't have a lot of control or you don't really understand their use case.

865
00:56:16,350 --> 00:56:19,121
Scott: Right, but if you or technology changes, right?

866
00:56:19,161 --> 00:56:23,846
Scott: It's like oh we'd had a we had this kind of API But now everyone's using WebSocket API's will make a new one.

867
00:56:23,886 --> 00:56:30,746
Scott: based on that We keep the old one because we keep the old one because you don't want to ruin everyone's applications But we're gonna turn it off eventually.

868
00:56:30,767 --> 00:56:37,680
Scott: Yeah So yeah in those cases you mean if you're using someone's API like that You just have to pay attention to what they're doing.

869
00:56:38,042 --> 00:56:39,329
Scott: So Facebook changes their API.

870
00:56:39,511 --> 00:56:41,224
Scott: You just got to keep up with their changes, right?

871
00:56:41,284 --> 00:56:41,989
Scott: It's it's up to you.

872
00:56:43,812 --> 00:56:47,868
Scott: I mean, hopefully they're doing versioning and things like that to you know, make it so they don't screw you which they're.

873
00:56:48,089 --> 00:56:51,070
Scott: you know They know the bigger they are the less likely they are to screw over users.

874
00:56:51,170 --> 00:56:52,214
Rym: I'm trying to find this article.

875
00:56:52,294 --> 00:57:01,810
Rym: So I read an essay was an article from a little while ago But it talked about because now I want to kind of shift because we've gone on for a full GeekNights episode.

876
00:57:02,031 --> 00:57:07,690
Rym: okay, but on the consumer side services disappear all the time like just basic stuff like.

877
00:57:09,691 --> 00:57:12,361
Rym: So Nintendo had a TV service on the.

878
00:57:12,402 --> 00:57:13,285
Scott: you never heard of it.

879
00:57:13,425 --> 00:57:14,409
Rym: that I had never heard of.

880
00:57:14,429 --> 00:57:16,661
Rym: that Apparently is shutting down in a few weeks.

881
00:57:16,681 --> 00:57:27,818
Rym: Okay, and Apparently it let you like watch TV But then the Wii U controller would like be your remote control and let you do DVRs and we use and give you a quote.

882
00:57:27,919 --> 00:57:39,300
Rym: second screen experience and The quote in this summary is it was awkward and fumbling and less than a year later Xbox one came along with HDMI passthrough voice control TV.

883
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:41,448
Rym: that made Nintendo TV look silly.

884
00:57:41,468 --> 00:57:48,550
Rym: Yes So if you're a consumer and you use services Stuff's just gonna disappear all the time.

885
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:53,690
Rym: You've got to be ready to just be constantly sailing from consumer ship to consumer ship.

886
00:57:53,791 --> 00:57:57,410
Rym: Like I bought a Palm Pre that platform failed.

887
00:57:57,739 --> 00:57:58,109
Rym: I'm on it.

888
00:57:58,170 --> 00:58:03,590
Scott: I know I'm on Android like you also just had to do a better job of either not being an early adopter.

889
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:07,313
Scott: If you're an early adopter, sometimes you're gonna get it wrong, which is fine Just like if you.

890
00:58:07,353 --> 00:58:14,157
Scott: with that if you are an early adopter, you can do a better job of guessing What's gonna sink or swim.

891
00:58:14,197 --> 00:58:16,870
Scott: and if you're if you're in doubt about something sinking?

892
00:58:17,430 --> 00:58:25,827
Scott: Make sure that it's gonna be something like Google Glass or Virtual Boy where even if it dies It'll still be like this precious artifact even you know, that'll be hilarious.

893
00:58:25,887 --> 00:58:26,590
Scott: years and years later.

894
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:28,497
Scott: You don't want to buy a Palm Pre.

895
00:58:28,537 --> 00:58:32,330
Scott: that's gonna be a worthless piece of silicon like VR technology right now.

896
00:58:32,430 --> 00:58:39,530
Rym: Right, like there's been all this VR stuff Any VR platform you buy is gonna be eclipsed in three or four years.

897
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:47,633
Rym: So if you drop 10 20 grand on crazy crap Like make sure it's worth it to you to have had that like bleeding-edge experience Cuz yet.

898
00:58:47,914 --> 00:58:56,180
Scott: or make you know, wait until you see who the winner is and then buy in right, you know I didn't buy the iPhone one about the iPhone 3G why?

899
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:57,003
Rym: that's the reason.

900
00:58:57,023 --> 00:58:59,390
Rym: there is an article that was analyzing a trend where?

901
00:58:59,850 --> 00:59:00,795
Rym: There's a small percent.

902
00:59:00,835 --> 00:59:07,990
Rym: So when you think of like a new social network or new thing There's like this like that five or six percent of people who use the one that fails.

903
00:59:08,010 --> 00:59:10,639
Scott: There are people who used Google Buzz and we're into it up.

904
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:13,850
Rym: Scott and I and all of their people use Friendster.

905
00:59:13,994 --> 00:59:17,394
Scott: Yeah, we used Orca we use the aliens took it over.

906
00:59:17,414 --> 00:59:26,910
Rym: We used or cut Google like that social network from before Facebook as Our real social network like we all used it on a daily basis for a while.

907
00:59:27,353 --> 00:59:43,210
Rym: That was weird to think back to those days like yeah, so, uh, but this article talked about how it Appears based on some initial studies that it's basically the same five or six percent of people Every time every time what they get they get it wrong.

908
00:59:43,350 --> 00:59:48,766
Rym: Yes, so these people whatever social network they join they foretell its doom.

909
00:59:48,926 --> 00:59:50,210
Scott: they these people bought zoons.

910
00:59:50,330 --> 00:59:57,230
Rym: Yes, they choose the technology that's going to fail before we know it's going to fail because they earnestly think it will succeed.

911
00:59:57,330 --> 00:59:59,096
Scott: Maybe they just have different taste from everyone else.

912
00:59:59,136 --> 00:59:59,357
Scott: Yes.

913
00:59:59,618 --> 01:00:05,170
Rym: So now that the essay was talking about gene for bad taste Yeah, we got to track these people down more.

914
01:00:05,291 --> 01:00:07,143
Rym: So basically that's one of the one of the like.

915
01:00:07,184 --> 01:00:09,055
Rym: a comment was like yes I really want to study this.

916
01:00:09,578 --> 01:00:14,869
Rym: if you've used like more than four or five Platforms that have failed like seriously email us.

917
01:00:15,511 --> 01:00:25,719
Scott: Yeah, if you use like a zoon and a palm free Google wave Google wave and like you were into those things Those are your jam and you're upset that they all got cancelled.

918
01:00:25,759 --> 01:00:28,025
Rym: Yeah, like you had a Nokia engage you.

919
01:00:28,045 --> 01:00:31,596
Scott: really your DNA is Valuable to market research.

920
01:00:31,856 --> 01:00:33,963
Rym: Yeah, you're the failure case not the like.

921
01:00:34,184 --> 01:00:36,230
Rym: you are the canary in the coal mine.

922
01:00:36,411 --> 01:00:46,450
Scott: So the next time you go to buy something buy the thing you think sucks But also tell us the thing that you think is good so that we know and then we can make investment decisions.

923
01:00:47,292 --> 01:00:49,263
Scott: And you should play the stock market also.

924
01:00:49,344 --> 01:00:50,330
Scott: person who knows what?

925
01:00:51,351 --> 01:00:53,318
Rym: Well, I just bought this new mp3 player.

926
01:00:53,399 --> 01:00:59,779
Scott: better short the stock of the company or ah I'm feeling like I like that mp3 player better.

927
01:01:00,181 --> 01:01:02,610
Scott: I'll buy the other brand and short sell the one I wanted.

928
01:01:03,474 --> 01:01:04,268
Scott: That's what you should the prep.

929
01:01:04,450 --> 01:01:19,950
Rym: So I suspect part of it is that those people have niche use cases because those niche use case people also tend to be split 50/50 in my Experience and anecdotal opinion between people who are super pro and have a very specific need.

930
01:01:20,031 --> 01:01:22,209
Rym: That's weird and people are just dumb.

931
01:01:22,571 --> 01:01:25,230
Scott: Well, I think I think it's also sort of a slippery slope, right?

932
01:01:25,550 --> 01:01:31,350
Scott: You buy one thing that sucks and that sort of fills gaps in your needs and then you go to buy something.

933
01:01:31,754 --> 01:01:37,804
Scott: Oh you buy the thing that fills the gap In your needs that are different than everyone else's gaps.

934
01:01:37,824 --> 01:01:39,570
Scott: You already have one failed piece of crowd.

935
01:01:39,690 --> 01:01:49,830
Rym: It's like what I had the palm pre like back when smartphones were still like not really like a hundred percent there yet Because the thing the pre did is it unified all of your communications into one thread?

936
01:01:50,611 --> 01:01:56,330
Rym: That was crazy and powerful and now Google Hangout sort of does it but like Twitter didn't run on that thing.

937
01:01:56,732 --> 01:01:58,161
Rym: No, so I couldn't use Twitter.

938
01:01:58,201 --> 01:02:01,977
Rym: so I would have used Twitter But because I had a web Twitter or text Twitter.

939
01:02:02,137 --> 01:02:05,948
Rym: Yeah, that was web browsers didn't work that great back then and text Twitter.

940
01:02:05,968 --> 01:02:10,286
Rym: No Huh, so yeah, that was just interesting.

941
01:02:10,548 --> 01:02:12,556
Rym: so Now I'm hungry.

942
01:02:12,576 --> 01:02:14,649
Rym: Yeah, I'm hungry as get anything else to say.

943
01:02:15,051 --> 01:02:18,023
Scott: There's one strategy you can use and I just want to say is real quick.

944
01:02:18,043 --> 01:02:25,850
Scott: So I use Amazon Web Services a lot especially at work and Some of the Amazon Web Services like RDS is like run a MySQL server.

945
01:02:26,191 --> 01:02:29,101
Scott: Okay, if they take that away you can just run MySQL.

946
01:02:29,262 --> 01:02:30,085
Scott: so it's not a problem.

947
01:02:30,366 --> 01:02:33,170
Scott: but other things like s3 It's like that's a proprietary thing.

948
01:02:33,290 --> 01:02:38,510
Rym: Yeah, if s3 goes down and you wrote an app that like specifically uses it and its API's right.

949
01:02:38,651 --> 01:02:58,172
Scott: So when you write your app to use something like s3 you should either a make your app modular in a way such that you can switch from s3 to some other storage engine that accomplishes the same task or B you should probably do both these things B write something that has the same API as Amazon.

950
01:02:58,192 --> 01:03:11,325
Scott: s3 sits in the middle, right and Yeah, so that way if Amazon s3 goes down you wrote a replacement for it that looks to your application Exactly the same as s3 but isn't s3?

951
01:03:13,752 --> 01:03:17,124
Scott: You can go on github and they're like storage engines that have the same API as s3.

952
01:03:17,144 --> 01:03:17,585
Scott: just done this.

953
01:03:19,191 --> 01:03:23,470
Rym: So like databases right say you integrate your system use like an embedded database for shit.

954
01:03:23,851 --> 01:03:35,113
Scott: So yeah, make it modular where yeah, you could stick Postgres or Oracle or like Sybase, there are a lot of things out there that just you can use the MySQL client to connect and talk to them even though They aren't MySQL.

955
01:03:35,133 --> 01:03:40,670
Scott: They use they just clone the MySQL API, but here's the secret for using their interface.

956
01:03:40,830 --> 01:03:47,010
Rym: You don't need to actually implement all those other ones just implement the one you need but have that wrapper there.

957
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:50,903
Rym: Yep, that'll save you so much grief down the road.

958
01:03:50,943 --> 01:03:51,987
Scott: Yeah, it's a really good.

959
01:03:52,007 --> 01:03:52,830
Rym: Okay, I found an article.

960
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:54,294
Rym: So this isn't the article I read.

961
01:03:54,314 --> 01:03:55,759
Scott: this is going long.

962
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:57,384
Rym: This is even wider.

963
01:03:57,444 --> 01:03:59,229
Rym: This is consumers who vote for.

964
01:03:59,289 --> 01:04:05,830
Rym: tell Retail doom Wow, they're talking about like Frito Lay like basic consumer goods.

965
01:04:06,253 --> 01:04:08,590
Rym: But it seems like it's actually the exact same concepts.

966
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:13,090
Rym: I'm gonna link to this article that I didn't fully read yet and if I can find the other article I will link you to.

967
01:04:13,655 --> 01:04:16,711
Rym: Okay, and now I Know I hungry.

968
01:04:16,771 --> 01:04:17,412
Rym: I need some food.
