1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:15,721
Rym: It's Monday May 18.

2
00:00:15,721 --> 00:00:16,263
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:16,906 --> 00:00:17,649
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,799
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:26,639
Rym: Tonight We're talking about ad blocking and I was delaying because I forgot what we picked as our show The crab people.

6
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:29,558
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:30,624 --> 00:00:31,130
Rym: Yeah, we had it.

8
00:00:31,151 --> 00:00:31,860
Rym: We have another idea.

9
00:00:31,941 --> 00:00:36,432
Rym: We might do a show next time on VPNs But I gotta read up a little bit to remind myself of some things.

10
00:00:36,452 --> 00:00:38,280
Scott: It's not a thing you work with very often.

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,419
Rym: Yeah, I used to like that used to be my job.

12
00:00:40,661 --> 00:00:44,131
Rym: I was like, hey a set of a VPN is the second phase up.

13
00:00:44,171 --> 00:00:45,876
Rym: what's going on with the?

14
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:47,220
Rym: the time would but I don't care.

15
00:00:47,621 --> 00:00:48,746
Rym: I have people who do that for me.

16
00:00:48,766 --> 00:00:54,292
Rym: I just say things like yeah, I'll put a VPN between those two things Mmm, so we'll see.

17
00:00:54,453 --> 00:00:55,599
Rym: It could be an interesting show.

18
00:00:56,942 --> 00:01:03,317
Rym: I could do a show on the fixed protocol because I know you guys are all fascinated by it But Scott doesn't want to do a show on it.

19
00:01:04,221 --> 00:01:09,000
Scott: Should we just do a show on every single protocol there is because we can just you know, let's go to any industry.

20
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:14,358
Scott: I'm sure there's like a medical protocol that like those computers used to exchange medical records.

21
00:01:14,398 --> 00:01:16,124
Scott: I'm sure there's a Big difference.

22
00:01:16,204 --> 00:01:20,258
Rym: Is there a protocol like that that either of us knows fuck all about.

23
00:01:20,278 --> 00:01:23,652
Scott: I understand There's plenty of protocols that I know FTPs.

24
00:01:23,672 --> 00:01:25,280
Rym: I said, do you really know FTP?

25
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,827
Scott: Yeah, you know FTP fully.

26
00:01:28,028 --> 00:01:30,599
Rym: how many ports does FTP open and in what directions?

27
00:01:32,045 --> 00:01:35,385
Scott: It only really needs two Getting and receiving.

28
00:01:35,405 --> 00:01:38,494
Rym: Oh, it's not sending and receiving its data and control.

29
00:01:38,535 --> 00:01:39,758
Rym: You don't know shit about FTP.

30
00:01:39,778 --> 00:01:42,005
Rym: the same thing No, it's not FTP.

31
00:01:42,045 --> 00:01:49,104
Rym: No Scott FTP is actually like if you use it kind of Overcomplicated and fucked up.

32
00:01:49,606 --> 00:01:58,652
Rym: and to this day most young people I know in the industry like just in general Cannot set up a firewall to let FTP through properly.

33
00:01:58,672 --> 00:02:00,840
Rym: They don't know the difference between passive and active FTP.

34
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:03,149
Scott: It's a giant nightmare, but I can do that.

35
00:02:03,491 --> 00:02:05,680
Rym: What's the difference between passive and active FTP?

36
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:11,489
Rym: It has to do with how you can open the firewall.

37
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:24,980
Rym: in which direction depending on who initiates which of the two Street or two connections that need to be open FTP will fail in Mysterious ways if you don't know like the weird details of what's going on down there.

38
00:02:25,661 --> 00:02:26,110
Scott: Okay.

39
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:29,146
Rym: Yeah Maybe we should do a show on FTP.

40
00:02:29,187 --> 00:02:30,492
Scott: How many protocols are we gonna do?

41
00:02:30,512 --> 00:02:32,400
Scott: shows us be a Monday night protocol?

42
00:02:32,804 --> 00:02:33,098
Scott: Let's name.

43
00:02:33,321 --> 00:02:38,517
Rym: So what are all the protocols that we know like either of us know enough to talk for at least 20 minutes about.

44
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:45,804
Scott: I got fixed HTTP NTP SSH FTP Something else that ends in P.

45
00:02:45,824 --> 00:02:50,359
Rym: Uh, I can talk a little bit about Tib RV the middleware TCP IP.

46
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:54,516
Rym: I know a little bit about tervela and solace, but they're just middleware.

47
00:02:54,536 --> 00:02:57,345
Scott: They're not that special It's probably a lot more of.

48
00:02:57,405 --> 00:02:59,332
Scott: I would just think of them XML RPC.

49
00:02:59,352 --> 00:03:03,987
Scott: It's not really a protocol to really Yes, it's the standard.

50
00:03:04,147 --> 00:03:13,125
Rym: Yeah a protocol is like one, you know, well, you know what actually that show we have to get into the differences like the difference between a transport or a Semantic or like what were.

51
00:03:13,145 --> 00:03:13,868
Rym: you know, there's a lot of.

52
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:15,535
Rym: there's a lot of the meta show.

53
00:03:15,615 --> 00:03:16,780
Scott: It's like about protocols.

54
00:03:17,101 --> 00:03:19,209
Rym: That's actually a pretty good idea for a show.

55
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:19,872
Scott: no, it's not.

56
00:03:19,972 --> 00:03:21,057
Rym: I think it's no idea.

57
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,418
Scott: go on to the news All right.

58
00:03:22,763 --> 00:03:24,600
Rym: So in the news this kind of an aside.

59
00:03:25,062 --> 00:03:30,040
Rym: But Scott kind of makes fun of me sometimes because I will often even if you know, there's news in tech.

60
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:43,539
Rym: But I'll usually go link to when we do the show like in the show notes to the slash shot article about the thing mostly because slash shot articles don't disappear unlike every fucking other thing we link to and to.

61
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,557
Rym: Usually in the past at least the comments would have a lot of like.

62
00:03:48,678 --> 00:03:51,200
Rym: oh by the way Here's the technical reason why that article was completely wrong.

63
00:03:51,261 --> 00:03:52,733
Rym: like a lot of smart stuff would be down there.

64
00:03:52,753 --> 00:03:59,420
Rym: and Also, usually they link to a bunch of different sources of the news and a little bit of commentary.

65
00:03:59,883 --> 00:04:02,279
Rym: So like it was just it was a good landing place for our links.

66
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,702
Rym: but as time has gone on I Feel like.

67
00:04:07,003 --> 00:04:11,019
Rym: obviously I mean like dig and read it and all these things came and went and came again.

68
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:17,177
Rym: Slashdot has not been the most growing and active community on the internet.

69
00:04:17,237 --> 00:04:21,375
Rym: to put it lightly Slashdot is a relative growing of the late 90s at best.

70
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:40,559
Rym: so I Suspected for a long time and I kind of noticed that when I was on slashdot in the 90s and then like at RIT Slashdot was like people on the not the bleeding edge But the cutting edge of technology like people knew shit about brand new shit and there was a lot of like.

71
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,584
Rym: well We'll just do crazy stuff in the future.

72
00:04:42,624 --> 00:04:45,452
Rym: and fast computers and like mod my body technology.

73
00:04:45,512 --> 00:04:47,136
Rym: Let's go fuck the consequences.

74
00:04:47,156 --> 00:04:56,326
Rym: I feel like the exact same people are now on slashdot and they're all in their 40s and Now they really want to slow things down.

75
00:04:56,407 --> 00:05:04,314
Rym: like they're not as comfortable with new stuff and instead of being forward-thinking They're backward thinking and they want all technology to be like it was in the 90s.

76
00:05:04,334 --> 00:05:04,435
Rym: Why?

77
00:05:06,721 --> 00:05:11,129
Scott: I'm sure someone must have researched why people become Conservative when they get old.

78
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:11,793
Scott: is it because?

79
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:12,598
Scott: why can't we do it?

80
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:13,963
Scott: I can't we use it cuz?

81
00:05:13,983 --> 00:05:18,860
Scott: clearly it doesn't happen to everyone but like slash dot you'd think like why can't we undo this?

82
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,055
Rym: A lot of us nerds like to say like Oh techie computer II people it doesn't happen to.

83
00:05:23,336 --> 00:05:25,946
Rym: I think it happens to them at the Same percentage as everyone else.

84
00:05:26,207 --> 00:05:29,180
Rym: Yeah, I think it's just a percentage of people flat across the board.

85
00:05:29,381 --> 00:05:29,744
Scott: I don't know.

86
00:05:29,804 --> 00:05:31,920
Scott: How do we un-prevent that from happening?

87
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,390
Rym: Is it because do people actually get more conservative?

88
00:05:34,772 --> 00:05:36,700
Rym: or were they always conservative?

89
00:05:37,101 --> 00:05:42,420
Rym: But they their baseline was the technology level like just ahead of them when they were teenagers.

90
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,199
Rym: So when they become adults now, it's way behind them and they're scared.

91
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:52,670
Rym: But in the course of one fucking day Slashdot like really?

92
00:05:52,991 --> 00:05:54,256
Rym: Well, I guess it's two days, but 24-hour period.

93
00:05:55,602 --> 00:06:06,940
Rym: Slashdots was batting a thousand for having an article a day where the comments like exposed Really deep-rooted Misogyny and racism and just conservatism.

94
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:12,860
Scott: But I mean this used to be the site where you would post things like GNA for funniness.

95
00:06:13,121 --> 00:06:13,825
Rym: Those are still there.

96
00:06:13,845 --> 00:06:15,052
Rym: All right, but they're all.

97
00:06:15,112 --> 00:06:16,620
Rym: they're all auto-moderated to zero.

98
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,270
Rym: The GNA is probably in this article if I go find it.

99
00:06:19,631 --> 00:06:21,880
Rym: I'm not talking about trolls trolly bullshit.

100
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,706
Rym: It's always been in there.

101
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:29,820
Rym: I'm talking about there's an article Men's rights activists call for boycott of Mad Max Fury Road and it linked to you know that news.

102
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,542
Scott: I heard about that.

103
00:06:30,703 --> 00:06:37,545
Rym: So it linked to that ridiculous bullshit of those really psychotic people who feel this Alright, so that sounds like a good news post.

104
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:38,307
Scott: It's pointing out.

105
00:06:38,368 --> 00:06:40,233
Scott: Hey, look the horrible people don't like this movie.

106
00:06:40,314 --> 00:06:40,775
Rym: It should be.

107
00:06:40,795 --> 00:06:48,000
Rym: a lot of the comments Were people saying oh those guys don't represent MRAs.

108
00:06:48,161 --> 00:06:50,027
Rym: MRAs really stand for all these things.

109
00:06:50,128 --> 00:06:50,951
Rym: and it was basically.

110
00:06:50,991 --> 00:06:52,235
Rym: it was super downvoted.

111
00:06:52,255 --> 00:06:55,684
Scott: Uh, no The problem.

112
00:06:55,705 --> 00:06:58,734
Rym: see I used every mod point I had.

113
00:06:58,754 --> 00:07:05,408
Scott: you're gonna see you're gonna see posts like that No matter what community you're in, but the slash shot community You see upvotes.

114
00:07:05,549 --> 00:07:06,916
Scott: then, you know, there's a problem.

115
00:07:07,358 --> 00:07:14,860
Rym: Yep So a lot of really fucked up and egregiously misogynistic things got modded way up.

116
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:19,619
Rym: insightful and so insightful yeah, well with the C I guess.

117
00:07:21,686 --> 00:07:36,338
Rym: So the day before There's another article Harvard hit with racial bias complaint and it was a link to a study showing that Asian Americans on average were rejected from you know from Harvard compared to other races.

118
00:07:37,402 --> 00:07:39,814
Rym: Well, all that, you know race being a statistical category.

119
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:48,739
Rym: We know race doesn't really exist Basically, they on average had to score 140 points higher on the system than other races to get in.

120
00:07:49,021 --> 00:07:50,610
Scott: Yeah, it's probably because there's some.

121
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:52,200
Scott: I mean, it's weird, right?

122
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:55,754
Scott: It's like it's racist to even explain the truth.

123
00:07:55,955 --> 00:08:03,700
Scott: Yeah, but it's true Is that you know, they study harder because their culture is to study harder generally, right?

124
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,113
Rym: So there's a lot more I'm waiting for you because you're walking on the edge of that cliff.

125
00:08:07,273 --> 00:08:08,056
Scott: Yeah, right.

126
00:08:08,117 --> 00:08:08,358
Scott: No.

127
00:08:08,378 --> 00:08:11,777
Scott: Yeah I mean statistically speaking, right?

128
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:20,020
Scott: They're gonna be smarter and have better grades and do better in school and there's more of them People in just China alone, right.

129
00:08:20,321 --> 00:08:26,820
Scott: So just population wise right not counting the cultural emphasis on education and better schools and everything like that.

130
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,763
Scott: So, you know, they have a quota there at Harvard probably and they're like, well We can't.

131
00:08:31,923 --> 00:08:40,317
Scott: if we just accepted people looking at grades only and not looking at other things This school would probably be a huge percent Asian now.

132
00:08:40,658 --> 00:08:43,707
Rym: This was Just an article about.

133
00:08:43,727 --> 00:08:47,545
Scott: you know affirmative action and those kinds of issues have a quota So they got to take.

134
00:08:47,686 --> 00:08:50,080
Scott: only X percent of the school should be Asian people.

135
00:08:50,341 --> 00:08:56,540
Scott: So they only take the creamiest of the crop and meet some people who were Asian and were smarter than some white dude.

136
00:08:57,006 --> 00:08:57,514
Scott: Don't get in.

137
00:08:58,968 --> 00:09:03,327
Rym: so basically Regardless, you know, it's a very complex issue.

138
00:09:03,448 --> 00:09:14,940
Rym: But affirmative action and the concepts around it are Probably a net positive Because systemic oppression over time fucks up whole communities in ways that are difficult to remediate.

139
00:09:15,402 --> 00:09:18,940
Rym: So I feel like affirmative action is probably a positive force.

140
00:09:19,272 --> 00:09:28,710
Scott: Yeah the person who Got amazingly good grades and didn't get into Harvard because some other is gonna get into Yale and be just fine Yeah, their life is gonna be okay.

141
00:09:29,011 --> 00:09:30,178
Rym: Yeah, you're still on easy mode.

142
00:09:30,198 --> 00:09:30,580
Rym: It's fine.

143
00:09:30,921 --> 00:09:39,493
Rym: so the top two first basically a Bunch of ridiculous racism and anti affirmative action is all plus five insightful.

144
00:09:39,814 --> 00:09:41,800
Scott: Okay, so why is it new?

145
00:09:42,362 --> 00:09:43,145
Scott: News that slash.

146
00:09:43,285 --> 00:09:43,928
Scott: that is awful.

147
00:09:43,948 --> 00:09:49,706
Rym: I basically I bring it up because slash shot I need a better place to link to.

148
00:09:49,726 --> 00:10:03,024
Rym: so I'm curious if anyone out there has a place that has the baseline type of information about tech issues that slash shot has doesn't post a bunch of bullshit and Doesn't have link rot.

149
00:10:03,566 --> 00:10:05,391
Scott: Well, there's no place without link rod.

150
00:10:05,512 --> 00:10:05,672
Scott: Yeah.

151
00:10:05,692 --> 00:10:07,277
Rym: Well slash shot has no link rod.

152
00:10:07,478 --> 00:10:15,134
Rym: That's the only place Yeah, so if there is a place like that I would like to know about it and I'm sure a lot of you are thinking but what about?

153
00:10:15,495 --> 00:10:17,442
Rym: I've probably already checked that Place out.

154
00:10:17,482 --> 00:10:18,967
Rym: it probably doesn't do what I need.

155
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:32,700
Rym: But anyway, I would like to stop linking to slash dot Because the community seems to be a bunch of 40 year old kind of racist kind of misogynist fat white guys living in basements or at least basement apartments.

156
00:10:34,141 --> 00:10:36,174
Rym: Sorry, but that's just how it feels right now.

157
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:36,980
Rym: in real news.

158
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:43,700
Rym: Microsoft pretty much said to all you people who kept saying Oh Windows 10 upgrade is gonna be free even for the pirates.

159
00:10:43,962 --> 00:10:45,292
Rym: No, that's not true.

160
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:46,400
Scott: I thought that was true.

161
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:48,752
Rym: No Quote from slash shot.

162
00:10:48,933 --> 00:10:55,233
Rym: if it sounds too good to be true Then it probably is all that talk about Windows pirates getting free Windows 10 upgrades not happening.

163
00:10:55,654 --> 00:11:02,659
Rym: for genuine users a free upgrade to Windows 10 means receiving ongoing Windows innovation and blah blah blah blah blah for the lifetime of that device.

164
00:11:03,683 --> 00:11:08,539
Rym: So you can't upgrade to Windows 10 and then transfer to another computer or anything like that.

165
00:11:09,142 --> 00:11:12,538
Rym: Granted that whole definition of what is a computer is pretty dubious.

166
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:17,981
Scott: fine Just install my Windows 7 again on a different computer and upgrade that to Windows 10.

167
00:11:17,981 --> 00:11:18,564
Scott: What are you gonna do?

168
00:11:18,825 --> 00:11:29,260
Rym: But basically the article talks about how if you have a pirated version of Windows It's not just going to freely like launder your pirated copy into a legit copy and let you upgrade.

169
00:11:29,641 --> 00:11:39,241
Scott: A lot of people said that no the news story originally was that yes Even if your windows is pirated you will still be able to upgrade it to Windows 10.

170
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:42,180
Scott: Yeah, it just won't be genuine because your current one isn't genuine.

171
00:11:42,722 --> 00:11:53,186
Scott: And if you want it to become genuine, you'll still have to pay but you'll still be able to upgrade it and use it Just like any other non genuine windows, so they confirm Yeah that January so they may.

172
00:11:53,367 --> 00:12:06,854
Rym: Microsoft made a few days ago this extremely detailed discussion of exactly how Upgrades will or will not work for people who have non genuine windows.

173
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:08,459
Scott: So right the same way it does now.

174
00:12:08,539 --> 00:12:09,864
Scott: basically It's not really a change.

175
00:12:09,924 --> 00:12:10,265
Scott: This isn't?

176
00:12:10,767 --> 00:12:13,356
Scott: this doesn't contradict any of the previous information we heard.

177
00:12:13,797 --> 00:12:20,660
Scott: if there's any news here It's simply that people didn't read what they wrote so that they had to write it again an even clearer language for the dum-dums.

178
00:12:20,721 --> 00:12:21,272
Scott: You don't read.

179
00:12:21,496 --> 00:12:27,823
Rym: Yep So if you have to not read if you were at all confused about what's going on with Windows 10 Read this.

180
00:12:28,184 --> 00:12:35,468
Rym: and to as an aside if you're avoiding upgrading to Windows 10 or you're afraid of it and you're you know Windows 7 not really gonna have much choice.

181
00:12:35,548 --> 00:12:38,949
Scott: I mean, I've been using Windows 7 probably just gonna go Windows 10.

182
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:39,479
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

183
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:39,942
Rym: You know what?

184
00:12:39,962 --> 00:12:45,537
Rym: My philosophy is whenever I get a new computer Whatever the newest version of Windows is is what gets installed.

185
00:12:45,577 --> 00:12:46,019
Rym: on that thing.

186
00:12:46,362 --> 00:12:48,480
Scott: People also people always be hating on Windows versions.

187
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,830
Scott: The only Windows version that deserves any real hate is Windows ME.

188
00:12:52,512 --> 00:12:54,037
Scott: even Vista totally worked.

189
00:12:54,077 --> 00:12:55,020
Scott: I had no problems with it.

190
00:12:56,821 --> 00:12:59,830
Rym: I bought Windows fucking 2000 like right when it came out.

191
00:12:59,891 --> 00:13:00,292
Rym: I was proud.

192
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:02,940
Rym: That was a great great OS for its time.

193
00:13:03,161 --> 00:13:04,989
Scott: I'm sorry Windows finally has the right idea though.

194
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,160
Scott: not charging you a fucking fortune to get Windows, right?

195
00:13:07,441 --> 00:13:19,220
Rym: I should be free and then they should charge you for you know, you know, it's interesting how a lot of people Suspected that Windows would get cheaper or something like this would happen if Linux on the desktop became a serious competitor?

196
00:13:19,361 --> 00:13:28,840
Rym: No, but yet instead this all happened Basically right after we put the last nail in the coffin of Windows of a Linux on the desktop and buried it under some rock.

197
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,916
Scott: And I'll OS X is the competitor.

198
00:13:31,037 --> 00:13:35,537
Scott: Yeah Yeah also non-computers.

199
00:13:38,243 --> 00:13:38,966
Rym: So you got any news.

200
00:13:39,267 --> 00:13:40,432
Scott: I do have a news so check.

201
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:42,300
Scott: so this story is really interesting.

202
00:13:42,843 --> 00:13:45,119
Scott: It's sort of obvious once you think about it.

203
00:13:46,863 --> 00:13:48,960
Scott: But it's like you don't think about it until you hear the story.

204
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:53,100
Scott: So there was a drug dealer and the drug dealer was smart.

205
00:13:55,122 --> 00:13:57,212
Scott: He was a smart drug dealer.

206
00:13:57,252 --> 00:13:58,740
Rym: they had those drugs in the stove.

207
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:00,968
Scott: They couldn't catch him right.

208
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:04,119
Scott: his drug Dealey website was all encrypty and whatnot.

209
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:11,938
Scott: I guess you know, they had a hard time finding what he was all about, you know He had a hit a pretty secure action going on.

210
00:14:12,792 --> 00:14:26,020
Scott: but What they did is you know, they I think they bought some drugs from him or they got him to buy some drugs from them and They sent the drugs by USPS because you'd be some drug dealers.

211
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:32,020
Scott: They they just deliver their drugs like by driving around or by delivering through UPS, you know, you go to UPS.

212
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,908
Scott: They say are there any hazardous things and you're using?

213
00:14:33,968 --> 00:14:34,852
Scott: no and they mail it.

214
00:14:34,872 --> 00:14:36,880
Scott: They don't inspect every frickin package, right?

215
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:40,471
Scott: Yeah, so I don't know if they got him to buy something.

216
00:14:40,532 --> 00:14:52,552
Scott: if they they bought something from him But they basically had it shipped by US Postal Service, which the government has access to and they Check the tracking right.

217
00:14:52,874 --> 00:14:53,840
Scott: the package had tracking.

218
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,004
Scott: So, okay.

219
00:14:56,325 --> 00:14:57,310
Scott: Someone shipped a package.

220
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,254
Scott: It was being tracked.

221
00:14:58,696 --> 00:14:59,700
Scott: How do we find the person?

222
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,600
Scott: It's not like they put their return address on it, right?

223
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,083
Scott: You don't know.

224
00:15:02,324 --> 00:15:03,812
Scott: they went to the post office and mailed it.

225
00:15:03,832 --> 00:15:05,319
Scott: You don't know where they live or whatever.

226
00:15:05,962 --> 00:15:09,375
Scott: They guess they could have checked the cameras at the post office, but they don't know that either.

227
00:15:09,395 --> 00:15:13,045
Scott: but Uh, they went to see.

228
00:15:13,527 --> 00:15:17,740
Scott: someone went to the website to check the status of the package.

229
00:15:18,483 --> 00:15:26,760
Scott: Oh and they checked the logs of the US Postal Service website And they saw which IP address visited to check the status of that package.

230
00:15:27,362 --> 00:15:31,860
Scott: The only person who had the tracking number the person I guess the drugs are going to or from or whatever.

231
00:15:32,153 --> 00:15:32,862
Scott: Wow You know what.

232
00:15:32,942 --> 00:15:36,937
Scott: and then they went to the ISP and like hey who's that IP address belong to?

233
00:15:36,997 --> 00:15:38,684
Scott: and then they went boom We got your drug dealer.

234
00:15:38,965 --> 00:15:40,551
Rym: That is actually very similar.

235
00:15:40,812 --> 00:15:42,980
Scott: Nothing illegal or shady about that whatsoever.

236
00:15:43,723 --> 00:15:50,957
Rym: That's very similar to the way you can detect if someone is you know sniffing packets from your network to spy on you.

237
00:15:50,977 --> 00:16:08,331
Rym: if You watch your DNS servers for Requests to find out the names of IP addresses that no one's using Because you're putting a fake traffic on network segments to see if anyone looks into it because someone knows that IP They've been snooping around.

238
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:09,880
Scott: this is why you know cloudflare.

239
00:16:10,496 --> 00:16:11,426
Rym: Yeah I know cloudflare.

240
00:16:11,447 --> 00:16:14,805
Scott: so cloudflare is basically like the number one company in terms of.

241
00:16:14,825 --> 00:16:29,274
Scott: I don't want to have to deal with blocking bots from hitting my website or going down because I'm getting flooded with traffic and basically the way they manage to do this is that they handle so many different people's web traffic That they are able to.

242
00:16:29,294 --> 00:16:35,500
Scott: you know Basically when one person gets attacked they can build a defense for that attack and apply it to everyone who's using cloudflare.

243
00:16:35,981 --> 00:16:48,640
Scott: But when you use cloudflare you make them your DNS server also for reasons like you just said So that they can see the DNS requests coming in and that additional information is what makes their blocking so effective.

244
00:16:54,863 --> 00:16:59,311
Rym: so anyway things Of the day, so I have a map here.

245
00:16:59,331 --> 00:17:00,516
Rym: Scott saw it from the distance.

246
00:17:00,556 --> 00:17:01,460
Rym: He was like, what's that map?

247
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,771
Scott: It's a map of the bunch of those triangles.

248
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:04,555
Scott: Those are poops.

249
00:17:04,595 --> 00:17:05,520
Scott: Those aren't triangles.

250
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,988
Scott: Is that like someone went around town pooping and that's?

251
00:17:09,048 --> 00:17:13,741
Rym: these are the most popular places in Miami where human beings just poop in the Street.

252
00:17:14,344 --> 00:17:15,869
Scott: Oh my god that like that.

253
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,060
Rym: You can see say Miami, Miami.

254
00:17:18,261 --> 00:17:20,619
Rym: So Florida man, Florida man is pooping.

255
00:17:21,361 --> 00:17:26,180
Rym: Florida man really likes to poop at the corner of Frasier Avenue and Northeast Second Avenue.

256
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,031
Scott: There must be something there.

257
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:38,780
Scott: No, Frasier Street You should use Street View on that map and see like what kind of object there is people can get behind Like an alley or maybe a dumpster that they can get behind the scatological Atlas.

258
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,087
Scott: Okay, the scatless.

259
00:17:41,429 --> 00:17:43,660
Rym: Yeah, so I would like to see something like this for New York City.

260
00:17:45,381 --> 00:17:46,243
Scott: New York City mostly.

261
00:17:46,263 --> 00:17:48,449
Scott: you get people peeing on trees and whatnot.

262
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:57,918
Scott: because or door frames because like you're a taxi driver you drive around All over the city and you can't pee in your car really and there aren't a lot of public bathrooms to use.

263
00:17:58,078 --> 00:17:59,800
Scott: and you know It's like you gotta get out of your car.

264
00:17:59,921 --> 00:18:03,100
Rym: You pee in a milk jug and then at the end of the day you leave it in a dumpster.

265
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,005
Rym: That's how you do that.

266
00:18:04,105 --> 00:18:06,740
Scott: Yeah, so there's a lot of peeing situations in New York.

267
00:18:07,021 --> 00:18:08,889
Rym: Yeah, pooping is another level though.

268
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:16,803
Rym: Now actually this is sort of a social justice thing in the sense that they're trying to Get public bathrooms.

269
00:18:17,084 --> 00:18:25,874
Rym: They're trying to bring attention to the fact that most of the people doing this are homeless people Yeah, when there's no public bathrooms who are also possibly mentally ill.

270
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:32,040
Rym: Yeah, there's no help for them either Of course not, but good place to go cuz no one no one gives a shit.

271
00:18:33,081 --> 00:18:35,774
Scott: If I was a homeless, I'd go to somewhere like Miami where it's warm.

272
00:18:35,874 --> 00:18:36,859
Rym: Yeah, I would not.

273
00:18:36,879 --> 00:18:38,428
Rym: you know I would not go to Miami though.

274
00:18:38,448 --> 00:18:42,694
Rym: I would not go to a place somewhere warm Yeah, but I would not go to the place all the other homeless people are.

275
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:47,179
Rym: but then again I have the luxury of being smart and not mentally ill.

276
00:18:47,782 --> 00:18:52,195
Rym: So I could figure think like I can make a plan that a lot of these people really can't.

277
00:18:52,276 --> 00:18:56,019
Scott: I mean seriously at worst you'd Be that you know homeless teenager.

278
00:18:56,686 --> 00:18:57,840
Scott: Well, not teenager anymore.

279
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:03,617
Rym: I'd be that creepy old guy hanging around a can be in the public library and the Starbucks with your internet.

280
00:19:03,657 --> 00:19:09,119
Scott: Yeah homeless You know anyway, oh, yeah, this is an interesting thing All right.

281
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:24,300
Scott: So this is just an image of a tombstone or part of a tombstone of someone named K. I don't know the rest of their name, but the tombstone has a recipe on it for K's fudge and I kind of want to make K's fudge.

282
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:30,280
Scott: So, I guess they you know, they got the recipe over K's dead body.

283
00:19:33,102 --> 00:19:35,848
Scott: It says on the tombstone wherever she goes there's laughter.

284
00:19:35,868 --> 00:19:46,147
Scott: so this is probably like an amazing fudge bacon lady K and would have been a good person to know and That's awesome tombstone.

285
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,460
Rym: You gotta have a sense of humor about death.

286
00:19:49,343 --> 00:19:53,679
Scott: I would I would have a tombstone like that if I had some sort of secret to reveal.

287
00:19:53,719 --> 00:20:00,219
Scott: that Would be useful to people who didn't know who I was and came around the cemetery years later.

288
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:04,274
Rym: Yeah So in the meta moment, the book club book is still Watership Down.

289
00:20:04,294 --> 00:20:08,467
Scott: I read some of it yesterday Like halfway when you're done with it.

290
00:20:08,567 --> 00:20:09,591
Rym: We could watch the movie too.

291
00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:11,498
Rym: Yeah, it's an animated movie.

292
00:20:11,619 --> 00:20:21,551
Rym: It's short short and good and then we can do a show on it and then we can do the next book club book, which is Dangerous, you're not gonna tell me what it is.

293
00:20:21,571 --> 00:20:23,040
Scott: I'll tell you after we finish.

294
00:20:24,251 --> 00:20:26,393
Rym: Just be careful careful son cuz.

295
00:20:26,413 --> 00:20:31,520
Rym: uh, the comb de Monte Cristo is hanging out with his friend Dumas just waiting for an excuse, okay.

296
00:20:33,823 --> 00:20:36,060
Rym: And also, uh, we don't have any conventions till Connecticut.

297
00:20:37,181 --> 00:20:40,370
Scott: You sooner than you think you should go to Connecticut.

298
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,794
Scott: Connecticut is really soon.

299
00:20:41,854 --> 00:20:44,140
Scott: Yeah in July and it's already end of May.

300
00:20:44,361 --> 00:20:45,245
Rym: It's a great con.

301
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,471
Rym: like we would go to it.

302
00:20:46,531 --> 00:20:50,826
Rym: Even if we weren't running the panels department Airplane to get there.

303
00:20:50,846 --> 00:20:51,690
Scott: I would not go.

304
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:56,871
Scott: if you can get there with a car It doesn't matter what kind of geek interest you have.

305
00:20:56,931 --> 00:20:59,098
Scott: if you can get to Connecticut with a car you should.

306
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,966
Scott: yeah It's worth your weekend.

307
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:01,850
Scott: Even in the summer.

308
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:02,674
Scott: It's worth your weekend.

309
00:21:02,975 --> 00:21:04,100
Rym: Yeah, I would.

310
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:07,135
Rym: Well, we did go before we were running all these departments.

311
00:21:07,236 --> 00:21:08,000
Rym: We had fun every year.

312
00:21:08,261 --> 00:21:10,508
Scott: I should just quit working and then just play games.

313
00:21:10,548 --> 00:21:10,990
Scott: all the whole.

314
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:14,000
Rym: I know Connecticut is a better tabletop than most gaming cons.

315
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:20,565
Scott: Like I mean you'll see if you if I quit and you keep the job you'll still like give me a panel, right So I'd have to pay.

316
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:33,179
Rym: and then and one last thing just because it's happening If you're a friend of ours who is an enforcer at PAX Go look at the enforcer shit because something's happening a good thing, but don't forget to do the thing.

317
00:21:33,962 --> 00:21:39,080
Rym: Yeah, like seriously, don't forget you don't have all the time in the world to do the thing.

318
00:21:39,563 --> 00:21:42,140
Rym: You'll be really sad if you don't do the thing.

319
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:45,233
Rym: So go to the place and look at the thread and do the thing.

320
00:21:45,253 --> 00:21:46,859
Rym: Yeah, I did the thing today.

321
00:21:47,161 --> 00:21:48,406
Scott: I also did the thing today.

322
00:21:48,426 --> 00:21:51,359
Rym: I want to make sure that all my awesome enforcer friends do the thing.

323
00:21:51,641 --> 00:21:58,995
Rym: Yep, and if you're not an enforcer and that sounds intriguing Whenever they open up general enrollment again, try to be an enforcer.

324
00:21:59,156 --> 00:22:00,080
Rym: It's really awesome.

325
00:22:00,201 --> 00:22:04,560
Scott: I heard for prime that that last year they didn't even because they had enough roll call.

326
00:22:04,701 --> 00:22:06,672
Rym: Yeah, so I'll call is still going for another week.

327
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:07,336
Rym: Mm-hmm.

328
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:11,353
Rym: So this is the kind of article that someone who doesn't know us too.

329
00:22:11,393 --> 00:22:14,604
Rym: Well would see and say oh wow I'm Scott are probably happy about that.

330
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:17,331
Rym: This is the worst idea in the world.

331
00:22:17,512 --> 00:22:18,254
Scott: Yes, it is.

332
00:22:18,455 --> 00:22:25,103
Rym: European telecoms are considering blocking mobile ads Full stop.

333
00:22:25,664 --> 00:22:33,865
Rym: they're considering putting basically an ad block on the ISP to block ads on Mobile carriers, right?

334
00:22:33,905 --> 00:22:35,251
Scott: So I go to a website.

335
00:22:35,773 --> 00:22:37,380
Scott: I have Verizon phone, right?

336
00:22:38,664 --> 00:22:41,300
Scott: The website tries to send me over their HTML.

337
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:55,879
Scott: Yeah And the Verizon website the Verizon server before it gives me the HTML looks at it Find stuff it considers to be ads using in similar technology to ad block and then removes them from that HTML and sends me the resulting HTML.

338
00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:00,905
Rym: now Net neutrality is Cut and dry.

339
00:23:00,926 --> 00:23:12,180
Rym: The reason we want net neutrality is because carriers ISPs telcos Providers they should not have any right to fuck with your traffic in any way.

340
00:23:12,741 --> 00:23:17,375
Rym: I should be able to send whatever poop I want over those pipes.

341
00:23:17,456 --> 00:23:22,269
Rym: if I break a law with that poop I break that law and someone comes and gets me.

342
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:25,939
Rym: but I can send whatever I want over the pipes, right?

343
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,500
Rym: They can't differentiate between my brown poop and my black poop.

344
00:23:29,782 --> 00:23:31,211
Scott: We just talked about the post office.

345
00:23:31,271 --> 00:23:33,823
Scott: right if I mail drugs I mail drugs.

346
00:23:33,964 --> 00:23:41,110
Scott: the post office shouldn't be messing with what's in my package or changing the address on it or Doing anything to it, right?

347
00:23:41,332 --> 00:23:42,660
Scott: They are a delivery service.

348
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,665
Scott: Their job is to deliver and deliver only.

349
00:23:44,725 --> 00:23:53,744
Scott: so your ISP whether it's mobile Verizon or home Verizon or whoever you got They should just be delivering the packets You want delivered.

350
00:23:54,246 --> 00:23:57,119
Scott: the server on the other end will then deliver packets back to you.

351
00:23:57,382 --> 00:23:58,560
Scott: Everyone's just sending packets.

352
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:09,559
Scott: Their job is to send those packets without modifying them in any way shape or form and then whoever receives those packets May respond or not respond as they so choose.

353
00:24:10,442 --> 00:24:16,640
Rym: But Rym and Scott you guys run adblock and you block ads and you talk constantly about how much you hate ads.

354
00:24:16,961 --> 00:24:18,607
Rym: Why don't you just not care about this?

355
00:24:18,627 --> 00:24:19,711
Rym: Well, I'm gonna net benefit.

356
00:24:19,811 --> 00:24:21,959
Scott: That is my choice to block those ads.

357
00:24:22,261 --> 00:24:34,720
Rym: The The protocol the whole point of the world wide web is that I can provide data with markup hypertext transport markup language.

358
00:24:35,061 --> 00:24:41,400
Rym: I am marking up data with hyperlinks and putting it somewhere so that anyone in the world can go to that place.

359
00:24:41,901 --> 00:24:47,940
Rym: Take that data down take that markup language down and display it and process it as they see fit.

360
00:24:48,842 --> 00:24:54,780
Rym: I happen to take that HTTP traffic and remove ads from it and reformat it before I look at it.

361
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:55,923
Rym: Some people don't.

362
00:24:56,304 --> 00:24:59,613
Rym: some people change the colors of websites with local style sheets.

363
00:25:00,034 --> 00:25:01,859
Rym: That's the whole point of the world wide web.

364
00:25:02,463 --> 00:25:04,200
Scott: Consider like a simple use case.

365
00:25:04,361 --> 00:25:13,920
Scott: I'm making a website and I put one tasteful advertisement on it and then I you know Make a mobile version of that website and I'm going to go on my phone and test to see if this advertisement is working.

366
00:25:14,522 --> 00:25:24,059
Scott: Oh the ad is being blocked by the ISP and I cannot see my own advertisement and now I don't know what advertisement it is And it's much harder to get another phone to look at it.

367
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,911
Scott: And this is just the basic example that I came up with in two seconds.

368
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:27,915
Scott: Mm-hmm.

369
00:25:28,096 --> 00:25:29,080
Scott: So now I can't even see it.

370
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,648
Scott: There's no way to turn that ad block off.

371
00:25:30,688 --> 00:25:32,215
Scott: It's not my ad block right?

372
00:25:32,236 --> 00:25:35,723
Scott: The ISP is Basically fucking with.

373
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:40,973
Scott: it's like someone sent me a letter and the ISP opened it up and crossed off a few sentences and send To me.

374
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,754
Scott: Senses were full of bullshit, but that's not for them to judge.

375
00:25:44,995 --> 00:25:46,060
Scott: Yeah, it's my letter.

376
00:25:46,281 --> 00:25:48,226
Scott: I'll cross out those sentences if I want to.

377
00:25:48,407 --> 00:25:49,951
Rym: now there's also the matter of intent.

378
00:25:50,573 --> 00:25:59,040
Rym: if this were some like nerdy ISP that was an option among many saying hey, we're the ISP that blocks ads right?

379
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,730
Scott: it's for example, you have a cool nerdy ISP.

380
00:26:02,111 --> 00:26:08,053
Scott: they you can log into their website and Enable or disable or configure ad blocking as you choose.

381
00:26:08,093 --> 00:26:10,160
Scott: they give you a proxy server as a service.

382
00:26:10,507 --> 00:26:11,020
Scott: That's okay.

383
00:26:11,141 --> 00:26:24,800
Scott: I could set up my own proxy server on my own point my phone at it and Block ads my own that way and if an ISP wants to offer that as an option That's actually really cool, but to force it upon you is not cool.

384
00:26:25,021 --> 00:26:26,707
Rym: So it there's pretty much.

385
00:26:26,767 --> 00:26:32,791
Rym: from digging around a bit there are at best three likely Actual motivations as to why they're exploring.

386
00:26:32,811 --> 00:26:33,875
Scott: Well, I can think of one.

387
00:26:33,895 --> 00:26:34,960
Scott: You're an ISP.

388
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:37,451
Scott: Yeah ads take up bandwidth.

389
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:39,240
Scott: you can save a lot of money.

390
00:26:39,361 --> 00:26:41,359
Scott: I mean the ads aren't making you any freaking money, right?

391
00:26:41,901 --> 00:26:47,460
Scott: So if you block them, you're gonna save money because they're gonna be less data transfer over your lines all these ads.

392
00:26:47,681 --> 00:26:52,457
Scott: They're probably losing thousands and thousands of dollars just transmitting ads back and forth.

393
00:26:52,537 --> 00:27:03,398
Rym: counter-argument Bandwidth is actually especially in Europe Insanely cheap to the point that these savings there would be negligible and probably less than the cost of implementing such a system.

394
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:06,575
Rym: Mmm Here's my real reasons why I think they're doing it.

395
00:27:06,696 --> 00:27:13,183
Scott: either one You maybe you think customers will like you more because you're blocking ads and because they don't understand the net neutrality Aspect.

396
00:27:13,203 --> 00:27:17,000
Scott: they're just like ooh, I'll switch to that ISP or switch that mobile carrier.

397
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,827
Scott: They block all the ads and it's way better.

398
00:27:18,867 --> 00:27:31,116
Scott: It's faster to use my phone and it's all you know, they can advertise higher Speeds and who knows what they may be doing this so that they can then sell The ability to sell ads to their mobile customers.

399
00:27:31,256 --> 00:27:37,760
Scott: that is Very very not only that is not only bad that is possibly illegal, right?

400
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,960
Rym: Well should be but we don't have net neutrality.

401
00:27:40,261 --> 00:27:52,759
Scott: that would be like if you know someone buys ads in the newspaper and I subscribe to the newspaper and The paper boy not only takes a scissor and removes the ads from the newspaper before delivering it to me.

402
00:27:53,421 --> 00:28:03,371
Scott: He takes money from the local drugstore and takes a you know tape and tapes that Drugstores ads over or where the other ads used to be.

403
00:28:03,652 --> 00:28:06,200
Scott: and now the paper boy is taking a cut from the drugstore.

404
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,689
Scott: Yeah, right fucking over the newspaper.

405
00:28:10,151 --> 00:28:12,880
Scott: and then the people buying ads in the newspaper and me.

406
00:28:13,021 --> 00:28:14,800
Scott: We're all getting fucked by this paper boy.

407
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:19,746
Scott: We have a new job is to deliver that paper in the original condition and if he fucks with it He should be fired.

408
00:28:19,787 --> 00:28:24,442
Rym: All I can think of you're saying that is $2.

409
00:28:24,442 --> 00:28:34,976
Rym: So I saw that movie a bunch of times recently just randomly, okay, so uh The other reason they might be doing it is to try to fuck Google because we know Europe.

410
00:28:35,097 --> 00:28:36,460
Scott: Europe hates guzzy European store.

411
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,528
Scott: Yes, Europe hates Google so much.

412
00:28:38,629 --> 00:28:41,460
Rym: Europe has like such this ridiculous hate boner for Google.

413
00:28:41,661 --> 00:28:43,367
Rym: They're basically trying to break Google up.

414
00:28:43,548 --> 00:28:46,720
Rym: They're trying to break Google's, you know, quote-unquote monopoly with it.

415
00:28:47,212 --> 00:28:54,180
Scott: I mean I Would be more sympathetic if it weren't for the fact that one they only go after Google and know and know the other giant companies.

416
00:28:54,562 --> 00:28:57,340
Rym: Yeah, well, they went after Microsoft way back in the day way back.

417
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,032
Scott: Yeah, they basically hate the fact that it's an American company, right?

418
00:29:01,092 --> 00:29:03,420
Scott: If Google was a European company, they wouldn't do jack shit.

419
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,362
Scott: Yep, right.

420
00:29:04,723 --> 00:29:08,795
Scott: So the fact that basically like Google has a monopoly on search.

421
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:09,557
Scott: No question.

422
00:29:09,717 --> 00:29:10,500
Scott: Sorry, they do.

423
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,791
Rym: Well, they don't because there are alternatives that are legitimate.

424
00:29:13,831 --> 00:29:15,155
Scott: This is an alternative.

425
00:29:15,175 --> 00:29:16,520
Scott: doesn't mean that you don't have a monopoly.

426
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:16,921
Rym: Well, they have.

427
00:29:16,962 --> 00:29:24,691
Rym: they have a. they have a I guess feature monopoly in the sense that Google search is Literally objectively superior to every other.

428
00:29:24,732 --> 00:29:26,560
Scott: imagine if there were three car companies.

429
00:29:27,102 --> 00:29:30,980
Scott: Two of the car companies are basically selling you goes and one was selling real cars.

430
00:29:31,381 --> 00:29:36,559
Scott: That's a monopoly just because there's some other competitor if their product can't really do shit.

431
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,823
Rym: so what's the line?

432
00:29:38,164 --> 00:29:43,378
Rym: is Google being anti-competitive by shutting out anyone who can compete like actively?

433
00:29:43,398 --> 00:29:47,517
Rym: or They being anti-competitive just by the fact that they're that much superior and they're free?

434
00:29:47,657 --> 00:29:52,579
Scott: right being Being anti-competitive and just out competing, right?

435
00:29:53,921 --> 00:29:58,080
Scott: For example, you know, Michael Schumacher, he won f1 championships year after year after year.

436
00:29:58,241 --> 00:30:01,620
Rym: It's not like he was going to other drivers houses and like waking him up at night, right?

437
00:30:02,142 --> 00:30:02,202
Scott: Why?

438
00:30:02,465 --> 00:30:05,222
Scott: because he's a better driver Right.

439
00:30:05,322 --> 00:30:07,889
Scott: Well and also he was in a better car, but they were just.

440
00:30:08,491 --> 00:30:09,213
Scott: they didn't cheat.

441
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:10,016
Scott: They were just better.

442
00:30:10,557 --> 00:30:16,597
Scott: Lance Armstrong Cheated he won out competed by breaking the rules.

443
00:30:16,738 --> 00:30:18,944
Scott: Google Doesn't break the rules.

444
00:30:18,964 --> 00:30:19,185
Scott: They're.

445
00:30:19,566 --> 00:30:23,880
Scott: they're just better at doing search and no one can do it as well as they do it.

446
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,830
Rym: I was gonna is now.

447
00:30:25,971 --> 00:30:35,320
Scott: I mean they didn't break any rules Yet, but Europe's strategy is basically make rules such that Google is breaking them and that is you know.

448
00:30:35,601 --> 00:30:44,600
Scott: It's like if they were to come out with the anti-drug rules after Lance Armstrong cheated or it wouldn't have been cheating Because the rule didn't exist when he did it, but the rule did exist when he did it.

449
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:47,395
Scott: So he cheated but Google didn't break any rules.

450
00:30:47,415 --> 00:30:51,820
Scott: while they're doing stuff Europe just tries to make new rules to make what Google is already doing.

451
00:30:51,861 --> 00:30:52,741
Scott: No good There

452
00:30:52,781 --> 00:31:10,220
Rym: seems to be a sentiment when I was poking around that a lot of your a lot of people in Europe at least on Like sort of the government II level have this argument that Google and ads like that are basically Forcing this American culture and this commercialism on Europe and they should have the right to protect themselves from it.

453
00:31:10,742 --> 00:31:12,067
Scott: Okay, you can protect yourselves from it.

454
00:31:12,589 --> 00:31:13,895
Scott: Google will just stop serving you.

455
00:31:13,915 --> 00:31:20,066
Rym: Yeah, I Kind of look forward to the day when Google does what they did to China where they're like, yeah, fuck it We'll just be in Hong Kong.

456
00:31:20,389 --> 00:31:31,340
Rym: Yeah So to me, it's interesting because Europe does not have any tech company That exists on the level of a Google or a Microsoft.

457
00:31:32,103 --> 00:31:32,826
Scott: I wonder why?

458
00:31:32,906 --> 00:31:36,460
Scott: maybe they because they keep treating them like this and not doing things properly.

459
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:42,681
Rym: Yeah, I mean there's no real free speech in Europe and the EU has done a lot of squirrely things like this in the past Right.

460
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:47,100
Scott: Well, it's reasons like this that tech companies are not going to put their shit in Europe.

461
00:31:47,501 --> 00:31:55,877
Scott: Right if you have you know, all these kinds of restrictions and poor policies and I start a tech company Why the fuck would I put it in your country?

462
00:31:55,897 --> 00:31:59,413
Rym: Yeah now I don't want to put it necessarily in the US either because the spying.

463
00:31:59,794 --> 00:32:01,260
Rym: but maybe I'll go to Ireland.

464
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,050
Rym: That's where a lot of people are putting their data lately.

465
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:06,064
Scott: There are a lot of tech companies going in Ireland Bad spot.

466
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:11,762
Rym: so the right way to do this is to block the ads at the client level the way the internet was intended mm-hmm.

467
00:32:12,184 --> 00:32:18,445
Rym: and a lot of people don't seem to understand how that shit actually works and To this day.

468
00:32:18,525 --> 00:32:21,620
Rym: It amazes me when I see someone not to get it.

469
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:31,600
Rym: You know, I we knew some people who try to argue that is morally unethical like it to block ads to which I say Oh fuck is it morally unethical to change the color on a website?

470
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:36,157
Rym: You're looking at to use a text-based browser to be blind and use the internet.

471
00:32:36,177 --> 00:32:36,679
Rym: Mm-hmm.

472
00:32:37,482 --> 00:32:45,474
Rym: But to a lot of people who use adblock even like they they download Basically something that looks like adblock and is called adblock.

473
00:32:45,494 --> 00:32:49,023
Rym: That is actually just malware Happens a lot.

474
00:32:49,604 --> 00:32:53,414
Scott: the current thing you should use is the you block or micro block.

475
00:32:53,495 --> 00:32:55,500
Scott: That is the current adblock thing.

476
00:32:55,581 --> 00:32:56,858
Scott: That is the right one to use.

477
00:32:57,181 --> 00:33:02,500
Rym: So in the old days like I was blocking ads in the 90s like as soon as the internet I had internet.

478
00:33:03,082 --> 00:33:05,020
Rym: It's the first time I saw an ad I was like.

479
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:11,231
Rym: I wonder if there's a way to not see that because I grew up in a household where every night the TV shows like The Simpsons that we watched.

480
00:33:11,633 --> 00:33:19,964
Rym: someone's job was to record it and Pause the recording to cut out all the commercials so that the rest of the family could watch the shows Without ads.

481
00:33:19,984 --> 00:33:23,138
Rym: so we all took turns being the ad blocker for the family.

482
00:33:23,158 --> 00:33:35,552
Rym: Yep So when I got a computer the first time I saw an ad I immediately started editing my host file and Maintaining basically a list of IP addresses that ads came from right.

483
00:33:35,592 --> 00:33:38,540
Scott: so basically what this method is the oldest jankiest method.

484
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:45,820
Scott: So your host file is basically something that every computer every desktop PC has right and I'm sure phones have it, too.

485
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:56,579
Scott: You just can't access it right because it's in the file system somewhere where you can basically hard code DNS entries and your computer your DNS, you know stack will basically not in.

486
00:33:56,739 --> 00:33:59,920
Scott: you know Contact any DNS servers if there's an entry in your host file.

487
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:04,615
Scott: so you can go in your host file and type in google.com and some IP address after that.

488
00:34:04,735 --> 00:34:06,099
Scott: or I guess the IP address comes first.

489
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:17,639
Scott: and Now if you go to any browser any application on your whole computer and you type in google.com It's not gonna go out to the DNS servers on the internet and figure out what is the IP address to google.com?

490
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:21,599
Scott: It's just gonna trust that the IP address in the host file is the right one and use it.

491
00:34:22,121 --> 00:34:34,938
Scott: So if you say find out that a particular domain ads dot Rym calm Has a bunch of ads coming from it and that domain doesn't really do anything else There's no other reason you would ever contact it.

492
00:34:35,322 --> 00:34:37,233
Scott: You just go in your host file and type in like.

493
00:34:37,253 --> 00:34:40,326
Scott: look one two seven Oh one adds that Rym calm.

494
00:34:40,386 --> 00:34:46,406
Scott: and now when your web browser tries to make a request to get the ads from as their M It's gonna hit a server.

495
00:34:46,446 --> 00:34:47,309
Scott: that's not even serving.

496
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:50,120
Scott: any web content is no HTTP server there.

497
00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:55,797
Scott: It's gonna timeout and nothing will happen and you won't see those ads on your browser.

498
00:34:55,818 --> 00:34:56,743
Rym: now It turned out.

499
00:34:56,844 --> 00:35:04,860
Rym: even back then there were people who were making Large host files that you could download and deploy where they'd already figured out where all the ads were coming from, right?

500
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:08,780
Scott: Because when you're serving up a website, you don't put the ad server on the same exact.

501
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:11,612
Scott: You know machines as that are serving up the web page.

502
00:35:11,672 --> 00:35:18,160
Scott: unless you're trying to get around that kind of ad block Even if you do it, it's infrastructurally difficult and you're at least gonna put it at a different path.

503
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,578
Scott: It'll be like Rym comm slash ads or Rym night.

504
00:35:21,041 --> 00:35:33,671
Scott: It's very very difficult to have those ads mixed in with everything else at the same URLs So that there's no way to determine based on the domain and or URL path Where it's an ad and what's not.

505
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:35,760
Rym: so that was the next level of heuristics.

506
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:39,240
Rym: That was when ad blocking as software as opposed to hacks started to exist.

507
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:43,140
Scott: Well, it started to exist when they started to make browser extensions, right?

508
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:54,615
Scott: Originally, there were just browser plugins and the way browser plugins worked was that when you typed in a URL The browser knew how to handle HTML, JPEGs, GIFs, pings, right?

509
00:35:54,636 --> 00:35:55,378
Scott: Those sorts of things.

510
00:35:55,398 --> 00:35:55,940
Scott: You mean GIFs?

511
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,619
Scott: Yeah, and it didn't know how to handle for example an SWF.

512
00:35:59,941 --> 00:36:05,060
Scott: So you get a plug-in and now if the browser hit an SWF it said well, I don't know what to do with that.

513
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:16,700
Scott: Let me see if any of these plugins that are installed are registered to handle SWF and it would find one flash and it would say Okay Execute flash and give it this file to do its thing.

514
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:29,468
Rym: So you basically stick a plug-in that would grab everything along the way and then use heuristics Like there were standard sizes for ads and standard locations for ads right or any image in those locations It would just not download plugins.

515
00:36:29,589 --> 00:36:32,500
Scott: plugins didn't really block ads because of the way that they work.

516
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,670
Scott: They were very bad at that.

517
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:37,876
Scott: I don't even know if there was an ad block But I use the one extensive.

518
00:36:38,036 --> 00:36:46,080
Scott: once people made Extensions right with the beginning that came around with the first Firefox known as Phoenix known as Firebird known as whatever, right?

519
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:59,811
Scott: once you had extensions that actually allowed you to interact with the browser API and sort of execute JavaScript on every web page and modify CSS and every web page programmatically Then you got to be really clever with the ad blocking.

520
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:02,120
Scott: you could be like, okay, you just got the HTML.

521
00:37:03,021 --> 00:37:13,580
Scott: Here's the execute this JavaScript on this page and like search for anything URLs matching these patterns and replace them with this and searcher right and then render the page after applying that.

522
00:37:14,081 --> 00:37:17,711
Scott: So now you can really block ads very very intelligently

523
00:37:17,751 --> 00:37:28,929
Rym: and now you have an increasingly complex set of heuristics to figure out What isn't is not an ad based on context because in the old days like you could just block anything slash ads Slash anything and assume it was an ad

524
00:37:29,531 --> 00:37:31,399
Scott: but that one method I used to use would just be

525
00:37:31,924 --> 00:37:32,755
Rym: Turn off all

526
00:37:33,482 --> 00:37:34,851
Scott: Images from automatically loading.

527
00:37:34,872 --> 00:37:41,981
Scott: Yep on a whole page You just wouldn't see any images and then if you wanted to see an image you would explicitly click and that would make the image Load.

528
00:37:42,202 --> 00:37:43,066
Rym: I did that too.

529
00:37:43,367 --> 00:37:45,254
Rym: And I also did that with JavaScript's.

530
00:37:45,314 --> 00:37:46,820
Rym: I did that with flashes, right?

531
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,919
Scott: Well, this was in the day in the earliest days, you know.

532
00:37:49,281 --> 00:37:54,474
Scott: It's like people would just be like don't use JavaScript because JavaScript is only used to do annoying bullshit.

533
00:37:54,514 --> 00:37:56,600
Scott: It wasn't have any legitimate use.

534
00:37:57,303 --> 00:37:59,816
Rym: Well, you can't right click on my website brah.

535
00:38:00,118 --> 00:38:11,540
Rym: Yeah So the interesting thing is that that technology like the early ad block extensions Often had options that don't exist in a lot of them today.

536
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:14,731
Rym: The one in particular is whether or not to be in stealth mode.

537
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:26,118
Rym: So in the old days they would either not download the ad elements at all to save you bandwidth or Download everything and just not show you.

538
00:38:26,139 --> 00:38:37,668
Scott: well Just not showing was what happened with the earliest extensions because they could really just do a lot of CSS modifications that would set like display none on all the things the Containers that had ads and that was easy to do.

539
00:38:37,688 --> 00:38:40,760
Scott: It was much harder to stop the browser from making the requests.

540
00:38:40,921 --> 00:38:45,580
Scott: Yeah, it took a while for extension technology and browser api's to advance before they could do that.

541
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:55,240
Rym: But nowadays I feel like we need to go back because an increasing number of terrible websites Will if they detect that you didn't download the ad elements will not display content.

542
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:57,766
Scott: Hmm I haven't seen that.

543
00:38:58,027 --> 00:39:01,740
Rym: I've bumped into that a lot and I've been doing some research about it.

544
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:07,340
Scott: What I have seen is people basically putting a non ad image behind the ad.

545
00:39:07,601 --> 00:39:08,945
Scott: So the ad is blocked.

546
00:39:09,025 --> 00:39:09,948
Scott: you see this thing.

547
00:39:09,968 --> 00:39:11,834
Scott: that's basically like you blocked our ads.

548
00:39:11,935 --> 00:39:13,620
Scott: frowny face and I'm like tough shit.

549
00:39:13,901 --> 00:39:15,469
Rym: So Fark does that.

550
00:39:15,489 --> 00:39:16,554
Rym: they always have a thing at the top.

551
00:39:16,574 --> 00:39:17,740
Rym: that I've been seeing for years.

552
00:39:18,101 --> 00:39:19,385
Rym: Let's wait for it to come back again.

553
00:39:19,405 --> 00:39:22,293
Rym: It basically says Fark lives on ad revenue.

554
00:39:22,634 --> 00:39:23,938
Rym: Please white list us.

555
00:39:24,399 --> 00:39:26,169
Rym: Nope Oh, look, it didn't know there it is.

556
00:39:26,189 --> 00:39:27,114
Rym: There it is.

557
00:39:27,134 --> 00:39:27,919
Rym: There it is.

558
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:34,240
Rym: Okay, so but I've been running into that increasingly mostly from websites.

559
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:38,789
Rym: I wouldn't just like if I go to a site and anything is broken because of my ad block I just never go to that site again.

560
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:45,473
Rym: Yeah, but The arms race is trivial to advance ad block.

561
00:39:45,734 --> 00:40:00,080
Rym: That is undetectable is trivial to implement and The technology will go back down that road if ads start creeping in again because right kinds of people who run ad block Don't fucking want to see ads and are never going to buy anything because of an ad they saw.

562
00:40:00,261 --> 00:40:05,440
Scott: So the way the stealth mode worked is that your web brat you would get your browser to still make the request for the ad.

563
00:40:06,042 --> 00:40:13,858
Scott: So you would you know send a get request out to the web service and give me that ad and then you just ignore Everything that came back and they don't have any idea that you did that.

564
00:40:14,341 --> 00:40:20,750
Scott: no, so as far as they know you tried to load all the ads but They don't know that you didn't actually load any of the ads.

565
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:22,637
Scott: you just ignored all that data that came through.

566
00:40:22,678 --> 00:40:23,844
Scott: you didn't let it Slow you down.

567
00:40:23,864 --> 00:40:25,939
Scott: You just blocked it on your port or whatever, you know.

568
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:37,392
Rym: Now the bandwidth is cheap and ad ad blocker blockers like like n-jammer jammers are getting increasingly Agro, we're gonna go back to that and that arms race.

569
00:40:38,074 --> 00:40:39,920
Rym: ad blockers will always win, right?

570
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:44,474
Scott: Well, the one of the problems here is the fact is the interstitials.

571
00:40:44,755 --> 00:40:46,380
Scott: Well, no, it's fraud, right?

572
00:40:47,142 --> 00:40:52,136
Scott: So the fraud situation is so the person who's selling the ads.

573
00:40:52,236 --> 00:40:53,159
Scott: I own the website, right?

574
00:40:53,801 --> 00:40:59,340
Scott: I want to increase the numbers of people who click on the ads and I want to increase the number of times ads are displayed.

575
00:40:59,461 --> 00:41:03,292
Rym: Yeah, because then I get more money Irrespective of the quality of who sees them.

576
00:41:03,353 --> 00:41:11,321
Scott: sure and I you know if I could I would lie to the person buying the ads and tell them a much bigger number than reality to get more money from Them.

577
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:22,160
Scott: if someone visits my website and blocks the ads, but I count them as having seen the ads This person who's buying ads for me is now paying for an ad that no one saw.

578
00:41:22,602 --> 00:41:23,628
Rym: Yep, but opposed to.

579
00:41:23,668 --> 00:41:27,987
Scott: if I just legitimately block the ads I'm not I'm a web so far could get.

580
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:30,014
Scott: so the current method FARC gets screwed over.

581
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:32,703
Scott: the advertiser doesn't pay FARC because the ad Wasn't seen.

582
00:41:33,205 --> 00:41:45,696
Scott: with the stealth kind of way FARC is getting paid But the advert person buying the ads is getting fucked because no one's seeing the ads but they're paying like someone is seeing them And they have no way to know who saw them and who didn't and what the real number is now

583
00:41:45,877 --> 00:41:46,419
Rym: option two.

584
00:41:46,881 --> 00:41:56,680
Rym: the first one the one where FARC the odd just doesn't get downloaded is better for everyone because Honestly to this day it amazes me the number of people who don't run any form of ad blocking.

585
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,351
Rym: I mean, I see their computers.

586
00:41:58,391 --> 00:42:08,319
Rym: They always have some malware and Websites look like shit Yeah, and there's garbage everywhere, and there's like pop unders and all this crap happens to them, but they live with it.

587
00:42:08,922 --> 00:42:13,000
Rym: So those are probably the kinds of people who also will in fact click on an ad.

588
00:42:14,181 --> 00:42:17,094
Rym: Maybe like the people who go out of their way to run ad block.

589
00:42:17,616 --> 00:42:21,195
Rym: you're better off Having like just pretending they don't exist.

590
00:42:21,335 --> 00:42:26,100
Scott: ad wise well Yes, and no if you're getting if you want to increase your conversion rate, right?

591
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:32,216
Scott: So if you want to be able to say to an advertiser You're a website selling ads you want to be able to say to them look we have a 50% click-through rate.

592
00:42:33,541 --> 00:42:35,990
Scott: We show an ad twice it gets clicked on once.

593
00:42:36,351 --> 00:42:38,860
Scott: that means half the people who visit our site are clicking on this ad.

594
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:40,728
Scott: Yeah, that's a ridiculously high rate.

595
00:42:40,768 --> 00:42:43,260
Scott: like like a few percent is considered high, right?

596
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:43,661
Rym: You're right.

597
00:42:43,681 --> 00:42:47,456
Rym: in that case you want the people who are anti ad to just not see the ads right.

598
00:42:47,476 --> 00:42:52,132
Rym: otherwise your quality click Go down, but if you're goes down right so, but that's only a thing.

599
00:42:52,413 --> 00:42:54,460
Scott: see different kinds of ads happen on the internet.

600
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:56,613
Scott: You got to understand the business of ads on the internet right.

601
00:42:56,653 --> 00:43:04,600
Scott: so if I'm advertising Some free-to-play game on my website I'm gonna be probably getting conversion rates.

602
00:43:04,922 --> 00:43:13,706
Scott: You know are what I want to be high because I'm probably getting paid Based on the number of people that sign up and start playing the game After clicking a link on my website.

603
00:43:13,746 --> 00:43:15,311
Scott: same thing like an Amazon affiliate link.

604
00:43:15,351 --> 00:43:19,163
Scott: right you get paid if people buy products and Amazon after Clicking your link.

605
00:43:19,364 --> 00:43:20,267
Scott: you want conversions.

606
00:43:20,288 --> 00:43:28,294
Scott: you want people to click, but if I'm my advertiser is Ford they just want people to see the ad to sort of get forward in their brains.

607
00:43:28,335 --> 00:43:30,819
Scott: if your advertiser is coca-cola They just want people to see it.

608
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,194
Scott: They don't need someone to click through and buy coke.

609
00:43:33,214 --> 00:43:39,760
Scott: but again if I watch I'm gonna be getting paid based on how many thousands of people see it And I just want that number to be as high as possible.

610
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:43,632
Scott: So if people are using adblock I'm getting fucked because no one's seeing the ad.

611
00:43:43,673 --> 00:43:49,936
Rym: but if people aren't using adblock Then the person who bought the ad is now getting fucked because they're showing their car ad to.

612
00:43:49,956 --> 00:43:51,368
Rym: a bunch of people live in New York City.

613
00:43:51,551 --> 00:43:52,120
Scott: they don't care.

614
00:43:52,964 --> 00:44:04,637
Rym: Yeah, well because the problem the real problem is the entire advertising industry and when terms of the internet is in my opinion a huge broken bubble of fake ads.

615
00:44:04,939 --> 00:44:09,079
Scott: all Advertising industry period is a huge broken bubble regardless of media.

616
00:44:09,099 --> 00:44:12,174
Rym: well No, because the fucked up thing is traditional internet more.

617
00:44:12,194 --> 00:44:19,054
Rym: so yeah I've seen so many studies that show that traditional car ads and soda ads Directly correlate to sales.

618
00:44:19,094 --> 00:44:19,780
Rym: people are that dumb?

619
00:44:19,961 --> 00:44:34,548
Scott: I'm sure that they work to some extent But it's still a scam in terms of how much they pay for the ads Verses it right, but it's a system where everyone involved in the system Neat like has a like.

620
00:44:34,608 --> 00:44:37,060
Rym: they benefit from a positive feedback loop.

621
00:44:37,542 --> 00:44:42,740
Rym: No one has any desire to introduce the bad news of reality into that system.

622
00:44:43,141 --> 00:44:44,125
Rym: So it turns into a bubble.

623
00:44:44,406 --> 00:44:58,303
Rym: the stock market does not have that problem because you can sell shorts Mm-hmm otherwise if you couldn't sell short No one involved has any reason to say anything bad about any stock ever because everyone wants stocks to go up forever Right.

624
00:44:58,323 --> 00:44:59,670
Scott: so so consider this right.

625
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:05,943
Scott: so outside my window right now at work I mean, I'm in Times Square just a bit north of it, right There's an ad.

626
00:45:05,963 --> 00:45:11,102
Scott: there's an ad that keeps changing and usually it's two big billboards next to each other and they're usually Advertising.

627
00:45:11,142 --> 00:45:12,607
Scott: some hot movie that's coming out soon.

628
00:45:12,888 --> 00:45:13,449
Scott: so right now.

629
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:15,857
Scott: It's about Jurassic World, which is looks like garbage.

630
00:45:15,957 --> 00:45:16,800
Scott: I heard it's terrible.

631
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:17,450
Scott: I'm sure it is.

632
00:45:17,471 --> 00:45:19,505
Scott: so Why is that?

633
00:45:19,565 --> 00:45:22,420
Scott: there is there anyone who's going to see Jurassic World?

634
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:25,360
Scott: After seeing that who would not have seen it otherwise?

635
00:45:25,581 --> 00:45:34,332
Scott: Maybe a very small number of people right who even notices this thing in the in the Times Square area right now I've at the same time that maybe look out the window, but I'm not seeing it.

636
00:45:34,593 --> 00:45:35,436
Rym: Maybe enough people.

637
00:45:35,476 --> 00:45:36,380
Rym: I mean spam works.

638
00:45:36,922 --> 00:45:39,471
Rym: Maybe some people are just that influenceable.

639
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:41,740
Scott: consider how much it costs to put that up there.

640
00:45:41,941 --> 00:45:44,740
Scott: You're making what a few hundred people see it.

641
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:47,051
Scott: You're not making up for the cost of those frickin things right.

642
00:45:47,071 --> 00:45:49,964
Scott: that is not a cost-effective advertisement I would not believe.

643
00:45:50,084 --> 00:45:51,810
Scott: but are you any stretch of the imagination?

644
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:58,500
Rym: if it really wasn't to enough the people involved Then it wouldn't be there like the the money funnel keeps.

645
00:45:59,383 --> 00:46:03,660
Scott: So this is why this is because you have to understand the people right that are happening here.

646
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:07,319
Scott: So the first person is like the producer executive of Jurassic World, right?

647
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:12,554
Scott: They like the fact that there's an advertisement for their movie in Times Square.

648
00:46:13,015 --> 00:46:14,299
Scott: They like seeing that it's for them.

649
00:46:15,302 --> 00:46:16,911
Scott: They like seeing it there there.

650
00:46:17,052 --> 00:46:18,480
Scott: We our company buys ads.

651
00:46:18,621 --> 00:46:20,359
Scott: I'm pretty sure those ads don't do shit.

652
00:46:20,721 --> 00:46:25,987
Scott: But you'll see people in our company are like I saw our ad on the Metro North train today And they'll take a picture of it and post it.

653
00:46:26,048 --> 00:46:28,420
Scott: and it's like the ad is for the person buying it.

654
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:34,390
Scott: They like to see their name in lights and they're paying to see their name in lights And they don't give a shit if it sells one goddamn product.

655
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:37,180
Scott: see now at the same time or they falsely believe it's selling product.

656
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,003
Scott: They don't care right.

657
00:46:38,144 --> 00:46:40,896
Rym: so I feel on a gut level that you're right about this to a degree.

658
00:46:41,036 --> 00:46:44,180
Rym: at the same time There is real evidence.

659
00:46:44,441 --> 00:46:45,690
Rym: There is a lot of fun.

660
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:47,862
Scott: that is a significant factor And that's what's.

661
00:46:47,923 --> 00:46:56,414
Scott: that factor is what's making up for the fact that the ad is not cost-effective Because that extra price premium they're paying for the ad is for.

662
00:46:56,815 --> 00:46:58,080
Scott: I want to see my name in light.

663
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:05,500
Rym: there is also an argument that those kinds of ads are Holding ground to not cede space to a possible competitor.

664
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:06,426
Scott: That's also true.

665
00:47:06,607 --> 00:47:16,560
Rym: if there's no ads for your Broadway tickets No ads for Broadway tickets at all then some startup that like gets some people together and does something can advertise in an empty space.

666
00:47:16,823 --> 00:47:17,995
Scott: That's true an empty field.

667
00:47:18,238 --> 00:47:23,120
Rym: now I'm just paying to keep grass in the place that your competitor is gonna set up shop right now.

668
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,886
Scott: There's another factor here right?

669
00:47:25,247 --> 00:47:27,434
Scott: so that person you know for that movie.

670
00:47:27,735 --> 00:47:29,220
Scott: We all know about movie budgets, right?

671
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,700
Scott: They got to get the expenses way high, so there's no profits.

672
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,326
Scott: Yeah, so just buy ads.

673
00:47:33,346 --> 00:47:34,410
Scott: you can get the expenses away.

674
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:35,695
Scott: has movie specific though?

675
00:47:35,715 --> 00:47:35,855
Scott: right?

676
00:47:35,895 --> 00:47:37,019
Scott: not every industry is like that.

677
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:38,844
Scott: There's a step below.

678
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:40,148
Scott: so this producer.

679
00:47:40,208 --> 00:47:41,953
Scott: They're not buying the ads themselves.

680
00:47:41,973 --> 00:47:44,240
Scott: you think they called up clear channel to buy a billboard.

681
00:47:44,681 --> 00:47:45,263
Scott: Give me a break.

682
00:47:45,323 --> 00:47:48,574
Scott: right there's a person who works for them and that person is an ad buyer.

683
00:47:48,854 --> 00:47:50,580
Scott: their job is to buy ads.

684
00:47:50,942 --> 00:47:52,254
Scott: Their job is to spend money.

685
00:47:52,294 --> 00:47:54,366
Scott: they get a budget And they must spend it all.

686
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:56,776
Scott: if they don't spend it all that budget will shrink it.

687
00:47:56,836 --> 00:47:57,720
Scott: the budget shrinks too much.

688
00:47:57,821 --> 00:47:58,592
Scott: They don't have a job.

689
00:47:58,855 --> 00:47:58,997
Rym: now.

690
00:47:59,017 --> 00:48:06,860
Rym: remember There's an unstated assumption that you need ads in certain spaces so they'll buy them to write what that person's job is to buy ads.

691
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:07,241
Scott: That's it.

692
00:48:07,322 --> 00:48:08,607
Scott: It's the easiest job in the world.

693
00:48:08,647 --> 00:48:11,980
Scott: you call people up and buy the most impressive fucking ads you can buy.

694
00:48:12,381 --> 00:48:15,532
Scott: You don't give a shit if it caught much it costs or how effective it is.

695
00:48:15,853 --> 00:48:17,359
Scott: right you don't get paid based on that.

696
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:18,384
Scott: you Get promoted.

697
00:48:18,424 --> 00:48:20,597
Scott: because look I got us a billboard in Times Square.

698
00:48:20,617 --> 00:48:21,443
Scott: look how awesome I am.

699
00:48:21,504 --> 00:48:22,454
Scott: I got us a Super Bowl ad.

700
00:48:22,475 --> 00:48:23,421
Scott: look how awesome I am.

701
00:48:23,702 --> 00:48:27,333
Scott: the more impressive ads that person buys the more they are praised.

702
00:48:27,653 --> 00:48:32,311
Scott: the more they get raises the more they get promoted And then move up to some job, but they have to do shit right.

703
00:48:32,693 --> 00:48:35,504
Scott: so of course It doesn't matter.

704
00:48:35,524 --> 00:48:38,454
Scott: if you're selling ads who are you selling them to?

705
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:41,203
Scott: you're not selling them to someone who cares How effective they are.

706
00:48:41,444 --> 00:48:46,960
Scott: you're selling them to this ad buyer person who just wants the most impressive fucking shit that you can sell them.

707
00:48:47,201 --> 00:48:50,192
Rym: Now you see there's a couple reasons for this too though.

708
00:48:50,614 --> 00:48:56,058
Rym: for startups for small companies Those ads can get them on the radar of companies that might buy them.

709
00:48:56,078 --> 00:48:59,250
Scott: mmm Yeah, they also don't care if they mean they somewhat care.

710
00:48:59,592 --> 00:49:08,080
Scott: everyone somewhat cares if the ads are effective But mostly the person buying the ads even though the company as a whole might want the ads to be effective.

711
00:49:08,642 --> 00:49:13,980
Scott: Right the person who actually makes the decision of what ad to buy only cares about how impressive it is.

712
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:18,272
Rym: But the smart companies the small like those companies that have really smart people.

713
00:49:18,834 --> 00:49:27,920
Rym: they're advertising in quotes Mostly through social media and word-of-mouth and clever things that aren't just ads on websites.

714
00:49:28,422 --> 00:49:31,457
Scott: I mean there are people out there buying ads who care about how effective is.

715
00:49:31,497 --> 00:49:31,678
Scott: right?

716
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:36,819
Scott: some guy Just started his dry cleaning business, and he's gonna maybe buy in the yellow pages, right?

717
00:49:37,901 --> 00:49:39,266
Scott: That's not gonna be effective these days.

718
00:49:39,286 --> 00:49:40,651
Scott: Yeah, but pages.

719
00:49:40,751 --> 00:49:43,160
Scott: It's like they actually care about how effective is.

720
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:47,300
Scott: They're gonna look and see how many you know they're not buying it to see their dry cleaners name and lights.

721
00:49:47,441 --> 00:49:48,266
Scott: They want to know.

722
00:49:48,286 --> 00:49:50,320
Scott: is this getting me more customers?

723
00:49:50,681 --> 00:49:52,348
Scott: You know am I building a customer base with this?

724
00:49:52,368 --> 00:49:54,075
Scott: and if they're not they'll stop buying that ad.

725
00:49:54,215 --> 00:49:54,356
Scott: right.

726
00:49:54,376 --> 00:49:59,834
Scott: so there's two different kind Of ad buyers out there, but these big-time website ones is mostly the.

727
00:49:59,934 --> 00:50:01,900
Scott: I want to see my name in lights ad buyer.

728
00:50:02,081 --> 00:50:06,746
Rym: The worst thing now is like like Hulu like a terrible example is like ads I want to block.

729
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:09,485
Rym: even if you pay for Hulu They still show you the ads.

730
00:50:09,786 --> 00:50:17,054
Rym: of course you can't pay to not see them and the ads are literally 100% for things that I will never buy.

731
00:50:17,074 --> 00:50:17,556
Scott: nope.

732
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:28,259
Rym: so What's interesting is that a lot of ad blocking software can even like within like the Daily Show and stuff like that in Video detect an interstitial ad and skip it.

733
00:50:28,501 --> 00:50:33,480
Scott: I don't see any YouTube ads anywhere at all except on mobile except on mobile right.

734
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:34,445
Scott: But I can said I've just.

735
00:50:34,826 --> 00:50:40,122
Scott: I should set up a proxy like I just said yeah my own proxy So that I control not the eyes I like.

736
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:46,645
Rym: do these people realize that if they like Hulu sometimes won't work now with like some ad blocking things and a lot Of video sites try to block it?

737
00:50:46,766 --> 00:50:49,600
Rym: you Google smartly is not on desktops.

738
00:50:50,142 --> 00:50:54,019
Rym: But if they make it to where ad block gets detected and doesn't work I?

739
00:50:55,240 --> 00:51:02,620
Rym: Foresee a real ad blocking technology like real software that people use that it won't skip the ad because it can't.

740
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:08,980
Rym: It'll show you like random YouTube videos of puppies during the ad because I'd rather see that or nothing.

741
00:51:09,401 --> 00:51:15,560
Rym: I'd rather see a blank screen and nothing and a minute and 30 second countdown timer than any ad for anything.

742
00:51:15,761 --> 00:51:18,740
Scott: And what if there's no countdown timer at all and you didn't know how long it was gonna be?

743
00:51:18,881 --> 00:51:20,740
Scott: I don't know you don't know if it's broken or not.

744
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:22,738
Rym: I don't know how long the fucking ads gonna be either.

745
00:51:22,818 --> 00:51:29,668
Scott: well No actually on YouTube and Hulu and most video ads on the internet They seem to have a countdown that tells you how long the ad.

746
00:51:29,708 --> 00:51:35,150
Rym: so I'll show that and I'll keep streaming the ad to the hard Drive and then dumping it to dev.

747
00:51:35,191 --> 00:51:36,820
Rym: no just so I keep streaming it.

748
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,414
Rym: They think I'm watching it and maybe even have heuristics to detect like.

749
00:51:40,434 --> 00:51:41,980
Rym: does it show a quiz or a survey at the end?

750
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:42,965
Rym: yeah I pick a random answer.

751
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:45,097
Scott: I just don't watch anything on Hulu.

752
00:51:45,117 --> 00:51:45,680
Scott: That's my snow.

753
00:51:45,801 --> 00:51:47,409
Rym: Yeah, problem is a lot of good stuffs.

00:51:50,202 --> 00:51:51,987
Scott: I just get it from the Pirate Bay.

756
00:51:52,368 --> 00:51:57,806
Rym: I'd rather not pirate, but I'm kind of driven to just Advertisement.

757
00:51:57,846 --> 00:51:59,453
Scott: I'm gonna fire it if that's the easiest.

758
00:51:59,514 --> 00:52:00,920
