Rym: Let's do this.

5
00:00:23,804 --> 00:00:31,879
Rym: I Forget if I promised I was gonna do this until the end of the year Or if I was just gonna do it till the end of summer.

00:00:32,642 --> 00:00:42,480
Rym: but I'm just gonna start talking about biking again because now it's dark and And Not super fun to bike home in the dark promise breaker.

8
00:00:48,302 --> 00:00:50,047
Scott: Yeah, bike and home in the dark kind of sucks.

Rym: I might fuck up with people got to go sleep When you're not going to sleep to like midnight unless you don't have a life You'd be surprised.

00:01:31,747 --> 00:01:33,359
Scott: what a little kiddies going to bed like, you know.

20
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:40,380
Rym: Well when I was a kid like my parents made me go to bed when the Sun was still out Sometimes just because you know timezone and latitude in Michigan and everything.

21
00:01:40,481 --> 00:01:45,560
Rym: Yeah, but all that aside I've been watching anime.

22
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:52,719
Rym: The problem is I'm watching old anime that we've won already talked about in GeekNights and to Scott's not watching with me.

23
00:01:53,203 --> 00:01:58,610
Scott: so I The man who punches once I'm watching the guy who's way too big.

24
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,437
Rym: Oh, I got a way behind on guy who's too big.

25
00:02:01,497 --> 00:02:05,973
Scott: Yeah Done shows on all these All of these before.

26
00:02:06,074 --> 00:02:11,880
Rym: can't review Monogatari or one punch man until they're done or at least a season is done enough to where we both watch them and can do it.

27
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,598
Scott: Like hey, it was yeah, I mean I gave him the first two volumes of one punch man manga.

28
00:02:16,241 --> 00:02:19,394
Scott: But it's like we don't you know, we don't need to do another show.

29
00:02:19,454 --> 00:02:19,574
Scott: It's.

30
00:02:19,675 --> 00:02:20,880
Scott: it's almost the same as the anime.

31
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:32,092
Rym: Yeah, unless the only thing is the review of like the holistic beginning and like if I reviewed project blue cheek you based on the first Episode triple-a best show ever but based on the whole show.

32
00:02:32,112 --> 00:02:36,692
Rym: It's like a B - B. ish, I guess roaches not bees.

33
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:45,443
Scott: Yeah, we can't do another episode on it and the other GeekNights episode about a show when we've only seen two more episodes of That show.

34
00:02:45,463 --> 00:02:52,332

41
00:03:09,652 --> 00:03:10,154

Scott: No, I gotta watch that.

43
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,711
Rym: yeah ponies started a little man like.

44
00:03:13,751 --> 00:03:19,683
Scott: the last episode I watched was the whole town is like Harrison Bergeron.

45
00:03:19,723 --> 00:03:21,689
Rym: that was literally the season opener.

46
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:22,572
Rym: Yeah.

47
00:03:22,653 --> 00:03:26,218
Scott: No, there was a couple episodes after the season opener So you watch a little bit after that?

48
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,477

49
00:03:29,538 --> 00:03:33,420

50
00:03:33,902 --> 00:03:35,108
Rym: No, I thought there was season opener.

51
00:03:35,128 --> 00:03:36,133

00:03:38,483 --> 00:03:41,413
Rym: anyway, I've but get once you get to the Halloween one.

55
00:03:41,494 --> 00:03:49,157
Rym: It's getting a little again But time is starting again - yeah and I think venture time starting again with something big.

56
00:03:49,217 --> 00:03:51,443
Rym: I'm kind of into this Business.

57
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:53,131
Scott: here is something interesting for you.

58
00:03:53,292 --> 00:04:01,387
Scott: By the way, there will be an episode this season of Adventure Time that was partially starboarded by Casey Green and someone else.

59
00:04:01,668 --> 00:04:03,575
Rym: Oh, I'm surprised.

60
00:04:03,595 --> 00:04:06,349
Rym: I didn't know that was happening I just tweeted it today.

61
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,820
Scott: Like when I left work, I saw that tweet.

62
00:04:07,941 --> 00:04:11,720
Rym: Oh, I follow him on Twitter, but I have not looked at Twitter a little bit cuz I was actually doing work at work.

63
00:04:11,921 --> 00:04:12,383
Scott: That's right.

64
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:14,773
Scott: Maybe the dick butt will appear.

65
00:04:15,777 --> 00:04:16,439
Rym: Oh, it has to.

66
00:04:17,281 --> 00:04:31,773
Rym: So in the news We don't pay like a lot of like little anime cons or even like mid-sized anime cons and fan conventions in general come and go and some of them ask us to attend and we really usually don't because we're busy.

67
00:04:31,793 --> 00:04:33,318
Rym: a lot of reasons why we don't always go.

68
00:04:33,338 --> 00:04:43,153
Rym: but There was one anime convention that I had not ever heard of Until this story the Akiba Expo.

69
00:04:43,173 --> 00:04:44,940
Scott: All right, it sounds like a normal anime con.

70
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:45,802
Scott: So where is it?

71
00:04:46,545 --> 00:04:48,370
Rym: I guess it's in Anaheim, California.

72
00:04:48,611 --> 00:04:51,078
Scott: They already have anime Expo like out there in California.

73
00:04:51,098 --> 00:04:51,660
Scott: Why do they need?

74
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,303
Rym: Well, I was gonna.

75
00:04:53,364 --> 00:04:57,100
Rym: I could go to the Akiba Expo website to tell you exactly when it was.

76
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,188
Rym: I think it was in December, but it might have been in February.

77
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,257
Rym: Like I don't know because coming up soon.

78
00:05:01,437 --> 00:05:04,390
Scott: It's gone All right, so it's an anime con that failed.

79
00:05:04,551 --> 00:05:05,616
Scott: exciting not news.

80
00:05:05,636 --> 00:05:06,419
Scott: This happens all the time.

81
00:05:06,802 --> 00:05:14,860
Rym: What's interesting is that this is By no means the first time that this has happened in very recent memory, but happens all the time.

82
00:05:15,683 --> 00:05:22,053
Rym: Yeah, but most people don't seem to realize this because from what I can gather Thousands of people bought badges.

83
00:05:22,074 --> 00:05:23,038
Rym: Oh, really?

84
00:05:23,098 --> 00:05:27,132
Scott: Yeah Why would you buy some badges some shady con that you've never ever heard of?

85
00:05:27,212 --> 00:05:28,035
Rym: see that's.

86
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:29,720
Rym: I followed up on all these stores.

87
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,567
Scott: It was like there was a convention in New York.

88
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:33,333
Scott: Actually, I think was when we were at PAX.

89
00:05:33,494 --> 00:05:35,160
Scott: Yeah called waka con.

90
00:05:36,241 --> 00:05:45,520
Scott: They supposed to be the Brooklyn Expo Center, yeah a place I wanted to check out but I Did not have anything to do with that because I was like, wow, this is totally shady.

91
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,473
Scott: But apparently it happened and it was somewhat legit.

92
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:48,540
Scott: So maybe I'll go to it.

93
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:48,782
Scott: No,

94
00:05:48,922 --> 00:05:51,860
Rym: so not only did apparently thousands of people registered But

95
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,649
Scott: I was so scab of a con I never heard of before get

96
00:05:54,729 --> 00:06:02,820
Rym: hotel rooms for it post about how excited they are That they're gonna be at it, but they bought a hundred and sixty dollar artist alley tables.

97
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,957
Rym: Wow, no one's getting their money back, I don't think anyone's get their money back.

98
00:06:06,998 --> 00:06:07,420
Scott: that's a shame.

99
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:13,292
Rym: So this you know, like there was that minecraft con that was the same thing Like the people who ran it gonna get busted for fraud.

100
00:06:13,352 --> 00:06:14,679
Rym: They're gone as far as I can tell.

101
00:06:15,001 --> 00:06:16,408
Scott: Why don't we fraud and run away?

102
00:06:16,428 --> 00:06:17,635
Rym: That's what I was talking about.

103
00:06:17,655 --> 00:06:18,680
Rym: Are you so Scott?

104
00:06:19,001 --> 00:06:19,825
Scott: I got my new convention.

105
00:06:19,845 --> 00:06:21,914
Scott: if we're gonna fraud and run away why anime con?

106
00:06:21,954 --> 00:06:22,216
Scott: fraud?

107
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:22,618
Scott: we can do so.

108
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,751
Scott: We can professional conference fraud where the tickets are a thousand dollars.

109
00:06:26,932 --> 00:06:30,665
Rym: So the I've got Harry Potter Avengers con.

110
00:06:31,027 --> 00:06:31,650
Rym: that's my con.

111
00:06:32,132 --> 00:06:32,774
Scott: That's the convention.

112
00:06:32,794 --> 00:06:36,485
Scott: I'm gonna make as much money as Wait till you see our guests.

Rym: Actually, I've got John Oliver to host the cosplay.

120
00:06:51,752 --> 00:06:53,740
Rym: All right, so he's gonna be the speaker of the cosplay.

121
00:06:54,363 --> 00:06:55,407
Rym: We're gonna have a rave.

122
00:06:56,151 --> 00:06:58,280
Rym: at least 10,000 people can go to this rave.

123
00:06:58,601 --> 00:07:04,440
Rym: We've got to mix Megumi Hashibara and every single kpop band.

124
00:07:04,861 --> 00:07:08,877
Rym: Every single one every one every all of them, you know how many there are.

125
00:07:11,102 --> 00:07:13,251
Scott: Take like a week just to hear one song from each of them.

126
00:07:13,613 --> 00:07:15,380
Rym: I assume there's actually an infinite number.

127
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:18,516
Rym: It's like one of those functions where RNG just keeps popping up new band names.

128
00:07:18,556 --> 00:07:21,529
Scott: the deeper you go I think somebody some at some point.

129
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:25,331
Scott: someone said there's like hundreds of idols in Kpop.

130
00:07:25,638 --> 00:07:30,145
Rym: so That minecraft convention.

131
00:07:30,205 --> 00:07:40,422
Rym: like people a lot of people were pretty sure it was BS from the beginning Even though at the same time tons of people like paid and try to go to it or whatever - con.

132
00:07:40,884 --> 00:07:44,680
Rym: the entire internet knew it was gonna be a disaster, but yet somehow people showed up to it.

133
00:07:45,202 --> 00:07:47,011
Scott: But this one isn't even gonna happen.

134
00:07:47,373 --> 00:07:54,269
Rym: the time between the internet saying hey Is this convention a scam?

135
00:07:54,289 --> 00:07:58,020
Rym:  it imploding was like two days.

136
00:07:58,241 --> 00:07:58,802
Scott: Wait, why not?

137
00:07:58,823 --> 00:08:01,451
Scott: Just if you're scamming and someone finds you out.

138
00:08:01,532 --> 00:08:02,394
Scott: Why are you running away?

139
00:08:02,455 --> 00:08:03,899
Scott: Why don't you just keep taking money?

140
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,067
Scott: So and say you're not a scam until the last possible.

141
00:08:07,227 --> 00:08:10,317
Rym: I put even odds on one of two possibilities.

142
00:08:10,418 --> 00:08:12,528
Rym: This is my guess Possibility one.

143
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:20,778
Rym: it was a scam from the beginning But the person running it got funding from someone else and I've heard some rumors about that.

144
00:08:20,818 --> 00:08:22,464
Rym: might be how they Actually got this thing going.

145
00:08:22,524 --> 00:08:26,800
Rym: Whoa squandered all that money and put together a best effort that was designed to fail.

146
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,415
Rym: So we can't easily be sued because it's not really illegal to fail.

147
00:08:30,496 --> 00:08:31,440
Rym: It's illegal to fraud.

148
00:08:32,062 --> 00:08:35,355
Scott: So if you try how did this person get funding for an anime con?

149
00:08:35,395 --> 00:08:36,500
Scott: who's funding anime cons?

150
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,768
Scott: I will put it on a real fucking anime con.

151
00:08:38,788 --> 00:08:40,996
Scott: that will totally legit happen not fraud.

152
00:08:41,037 --> 00:08:47,290
Scott: if you fund me Someone funds me to run an anime con I will run a kick-ass anime con somewhere.

153
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:56,338
Scott: if you fund me say I don't have to go to my regular job The packs of anime cons The best fucking con will start small the first year, but we're gonna.

154
00:08:56,479 --> 00:08:58,850
Scott: you know We won't spend all your money and then we're gonna use.

155
00:08:58,930 --> 00:08:59,613
Scott: we're gonna profit.

156
00:08:59,653 --> 00:09:01,120
Rym: for sure wouldn't even need that much.

157
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:09,355
Scott: You know we need and we're gonna kick ass year after year and we're gonna build that up and within like the third year It'll be like we'll be getting ready to like almost compete with anime Boston.

158
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:14,818
Scott: I would need like 300 K tops sure Oh plus enough to live.

159
00:09:15,746 --> 00:09:16,616
Rym: Well, yeah plus anyway.

160
00:09:17,922 --> 00:09:20,578
Rym: But so basically this threat appeared on 4chan.

161
00:09:20,598 --> 00:09:25,494
Rym: and Is anyone planning on attending Akiba Expo?

162
00:09:25,554 --> 00:09:26,780
Rym: It's a first-year con in Anaheim.

163
00:09:27,063 --> 00:09:28,860
Rym: I wanted to go since 20 even drive in my house.

164
00:09:29,181 --> 00:09:33,956
Rym: But I'm double thinking it because there's been some shady business practices and drama surrounding the event.

165
00:09:34,137 --> 00:09:35,040
Scott: don't double think it.

166
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,565
Scott: You only need to think once shady.

167
00:09:36,605 --> 00:09:36,766
Scott: Nope.

168
00:09:37,428 --> 00:09:39,033
Scott: That's the one half a thing.

169
00:09:39,093 --> 00:09:39,615
Scott: It's like what.

170
00:09:39,635 --> 00:09:40,659
Scott: there's something shady about this?

171
00:09:40,699 --> 00:09:48,080
Rym: nope Yep Capitals no Anna Twitter Started looking at this con because they noticed it because people started talking about it a little bit.

172
00:09:48,341 --> 00:09:52,419
Rym: So I went and looked at the hashtags and it was all people talking about how excited they were to go.

173
00:09:52,941 --> 00:09:54,848
Rym: And in fact, they're still talking about it.

174
00:09:55,189 --> 00:09:58,420
Rym: I think a lot of people attending this con don't know that it's gone.

175
00:09:59,241 --> 00:10:03,473
Rym: I'll bet people are going to show up in Anaheim because apparently they mailed their badges.

176
00:10:03,774 --> 00:10:13,558
Rym: people tweeted pictures their fucking badges Oh snap, so someone did something that wasn't complete A lot but from what I can gather they posted a lineup of guests and then one by one to get.

177
00:10:13,598 --> 00:10:18,860
Rym: the people who were Listed were like, uh, I'm not I didn't say I was attending that con.

178
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:27,472
Rym: Supposedly someone who was trying to staff the con with guest relations Leaked a bunch of emails and was like yo dog.

179
00:10:27,512 --> 00:10:28,999
Rym: This shit is not happening.

180
00:10:30,662 --> 00:10:34,216
Scott: All this all why don't you just contact the space that it's supposed to be in?

181
00:10:34,457 --> 00:10:35,200
Scott: so that was the other thing.

182
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,540
Rym: No one was sure where it was because it was implied it doesn't have a location.

183
00:10:38,701 --> 00:10:41,760
Rym: It was implied that was at some convention center and all the convention center.

184
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,503
Rym: Oh, yeah people.

185
00:10:42,543 --> 00:10:49,860
Rym: so once Anna Twitter pointed at this someone pointed out immediately like yeah That event is not listed on the Anaheim Convention Center.

186
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:54,960
Rym: And then someone else said that oh, it looks like they're actually at just this hotel called the hotel in Anaheim.

187
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:59,455
Rym: So yeah, so those investigations began like real.

188
00:10:59,555 --> 00:11:00,137
Rym: recently.

189
00:11:00,218 --> 00:11:02,913
Scott: like this went this How long is this convention been taking people's money?

190
00:11:02,994 --> 00:11:05,304
Rym: Apparently a long time For a while.

191
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:08,735
Rym: so the the Facebook page went from.

192
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:09,959
Rym: we're not a scam to.

193
00:11:10,802 --> 00:11:11,865
Rym: the event is canceled.

194
00:11:12,266 --> 00:11:13,871
Rym: their official website went from.

195
00:11:13,911 --> 00:11:30,560
Rym: it looks like some general generic Squarespace site with The convention rules and policies which I should you not were a copy/paste of a rave Rules because it had all this shit about rave nonsense and how big your totems can be and totems.

196
00:11:31,102 --> 00:11:32,066
Rym: Yeah, that's a reaver thing.

197
00:11:32,086 --> 00:11:34,115
Rym: they bring these big totem poles and wave them around.

198
00:11:34,357 --> 00:11:35,521
Rym: it's the stupidest They don't.

199
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:36,304
Scott: I never heard of this.

200
00:11:36,685 --> 00:11:36,946
Rym: ray.

201
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,435
Rym: go go go to a rave and read their rules.

202
00:11:39,776 --> 00:11:45,860
Rym: You were not allowed to bring Professional video or camera equipment which included anything with the detachable lens, okay?

203
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:51,100
Rym: You could not bring over-the-counter medicine of any kind or prescription medicine of any kind.

204
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,626
Scott: But the raves are full of drugs.

205
00:11:52,907 --> 00:11:54,473
Scott: you are everyone brings them in.

206
00:11:54,493 --> 00:11:56,724
Scott: so I don't think these rules are being enforced very well I don't know.

207
00:11:56,744 --> 00:11:57,834
Rym: I don't go to a lot of raves.

208
00:11:57,915 --> 00:12:04,158
Scott: Yeah, but Yeah, so it was really if you told me there was actually a rave that didn't have any drugs going on at it.

209
00:12:04,198 --> 00:12:04,358
Scott: like.

210
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:06,005
Scott: I'm Not gonna be in a cloud of smoke.

211
00:12:06,105 --> 00:12:08,154
Scott: I mean I like electronic music.

212
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:09,640
Scott: I would totally go and have a dance.

213
00:12:10,342 --> 00:12:12,840
Rym: You want to go to a straight-edge rave?

214
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,367
Rym: I know of a few in New York City.

215
00:12:14,387 --> 00:12:15,152
Scott: is it gonna be huge?

216
00:12:15,172 --> 00:12:16,440
Scott: and is the good DJ gonna be there?

217
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,025
Scott: I'm gonna be there just DJ.

218
00:12:18,046 --> 00:12:19,149
Rym: They're just straight edge.

219
00:12:19,169 --> 00:12:22,160
Rym: They're all like Henry Rollins fans going to these things okay?

220
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,227
Scott: Yeah, that's a good time.

221
00:12:23,308 --> 00:12:24,479
Rym: There's also quiet events.

222
00:12:24,861 --> 00:12:30,360
Rym: They do raves that are big and giant, but they everyone gets headphones and the music's all just in the headphones.

223
00:12:30,481 --> 00:12:31,411
Scott: I don't like that now.

224
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:32,038
Rym: You don't like that?

225
00:12:32,058 --> 00:12:35,316
Rym: no That's not good, but do you want to like roll around in bubbles and get high on ecstasy?

226
00:12:35,336 --> 00:12:35,437
Rym: like?

227
00:12:35,457 --> 00:12:47,720
Scott: no I want there to be just a dance party where it's music only and it's legit dancing But the soap you know electronic music It's not a rave with drugs and all sorts of weird light stick people, but normal people.

228
00:12:47,941 --> 00:12:49,106
Rym: Here's the there's.

229
00:12:49,388 --> 00:12:57,078
Rym: what happened here with Akiva Expo Brings up a lot of interesting points that may or may not be worth further discussion not now, but in the future.

230
00:12:57,339 --> 00:13:01,878
Rym: one Who are these people who see a website for a convention and without?

231
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:07,399
Rym: Looking at any other part of the internet type their parents credit card number in and rent a hotel room.

232
00:13:08,483 --> 00:13:11,720
Rym: Who are these people who are still dateline now?

233
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:16,031
Rym: Tweeting about the con not knowing that it's gone.

234
00:13:16,191 --> 00:13:19,260
Rym: I found a tweet where someone's like oh looks like the websites down.

235
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,345
Rym: Hopefully, it'll be back soon.

236
00:13:20,386 --> 00:13:21,913
Rym: I wanted something something artist alley.

237
00:13:21,933 --> 00:13:28,900
Rym: It's like yeah, dude I Think what if someone on an administrator was gonna has a gofundme?

238
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,646
Rym: He was like I will fucking legit.

239
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:33,716
Rym: go to this thing and live tweet the entire convention if you send me there.

240
00:13:33,736 --> 00:13:39,200
Scott: Oh Okay, yeah, so I wonder if you go tweeting from outside the convey the hotel.

241
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:47,263
Scott: I wonder if he's gonna go anyway And just see like an interview these people who show up thinking there's gonna be a convention when they're all their badges And there isn't anything there.

242
00:13:47,765 --> 00:13:59,974
Rym: uh there is such demand for anime cons that Pretty much any first-year con seems to sell out almost anywhere Which is actually kind of I can't imagine this comm is gonna be that big in the hotel.

243
00:13:59,994 --> 00:14:04,072
Rym: well according to the website It's gonna be the fucking biggest thing you've ever seen.

244
00:14:04,092 --> 00:14:05,640
Rym: you should have seen what was on this website.

245
00:14:06,601 --> 00:14:15,264
Rym: People are posting Google caches of what the website looked like but the most beautiful thing in the world my favorite Thing mm-hmm.

246
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:16,548
Rym: I gotta pull it off here.

247
00:14:16,568 --> 00:14:29,588
Rym: doo doo doo doo good night, so Sans Duvall tweeted good night sweet prince ten hours ago, and it is a screenshot of Where they announced.

248
00:14:29,628 --> 00:14:31,260
Rym: the convention is no longer happening.

249
00:14:31,802 --> 00:14:34,029
Rym: They didn't announce another website because that shit's gone.

250
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,273
Rym: They announced it on their website.

251
00:14:35,294 --> 00:14:37,120
Scott: probably cost money if it's Squarespace.

252
00:14:37,803 --> 00:14:41,400
Rym: Squarespace cost like ten bucks a month like it's not I mean if you're running away with all the money.

253
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,805
Scott: You don't have ten bucks a month anymore.

254
00:14:42,845 --> 00:14:44,671
Rym: Do you to our guests and fans?

255
00:14:45,173 --> 00:14:47,180
Rym: due to the recent rumors and allegations?

256
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,767
Rym: We are forced to bring Akihabara Expo to a halt.

257
00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:55,325
Rym: most of our staff have left the organization due to threats as well as distrust Of the exposition due to recent events.

258
00:14:55,766 --> 00:15:01,927
Rym: without people to run the show and without the people who helped us build this we cannot execute A show that we would be proud of.

259
00:15:02,228 --> 00:15:06,906
Rym: in addition most of our guests have left due to the constant drama and harassment Our exposition has faced.

260
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:12,751
Rym: we wish the show could go on but without proper staffing and a solid lineup We cannot bring the same quality experience that we had promised you.

261
00:15:13,073 --> 00:15:16,637
Rym: if you wish to receive a recent refund Please fill the form below.

262
00:15:17,403 --> 00:15:20,059
Scott: Please fill the form and we'll know who all the suckers are.

263
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,748
Scott: Yeah, anyone gets a read.

264
00:15:22,808 --> 00:15:24,455
Scott: I want to hear from someone who gets a refund.

265
00:15:24,595 --> 00:15:28,271
Rym: Oh so option two Here's my other the other 50/50 hours than what happened here.

266
00:15:28,371 --> 00:15:30,881
Rym: It is possible from some of the leaks I read of.

267
00:15:30,921 --> 00:15:35,252
Rym: like guests were contacted, but like weren't sent contracts, and it was all.

268
00:15:35,974 --> 00:15:53,294
Rym: it is possible that someone Got in over their head and thought they could run a con and somehow got a hold of enough money to like Start making a con But just didn't know what the fuck they were doing and tried to just kind of string it all along Until eventually it fell apart like a house of cards.

269
00:15:53,617 --> 00:15:55,025
Rym: hmm I give even odds.

270
00:15:55,065 --> 00:16:06,820
Rym: neither one of those things whatever but this You can just search for Akiva Expo on Twitter and over the course of two days You can see this go from a hundred to zero and it's beautiful.

271
00:16:07,302 --> 00:16:13,400
Scott: And so in other news that actually affects people who affect a lot of people aren't stupid?

272
00:16:14,762 --> 00:16:16,187
Scott: There was some mumblings this week.

273
00:16:16,268 --> 00:16:19,540
Scott: nothing like totally confirmed or locked in or anything like that.

274
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:30,860
Scott: no details, but Netflix who has been producing shows on their own as shown great interest in making anime and Bollywood.

275
00:16:31,321 --> 00:16:37,900
Scott: Yes, this may mean that they'll actually have a studio at Netflix that produces like Netflix original anime.

276
00:16:38,241 --> 00:16:45,584
Scott: Or maybe it means that like they'll hire a Japanese studio like madhouse or somebody and be like hey Here's a bunch of money.

277
00:16:45,644 --> 00:16:48,234
Scott: make this anime for us or who knows what.

278
00:16:48,334 --> 00:16:54,380
Scott: but there's gonna be Possibly some animes in the future with any you know how many months or years?

279
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:58,360
Scott: That are only on Netflix until someone pirates them off of Netflix.

280
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,189
Rym: That's a big deal for one reason.

281
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:03,176
Rym: that reason is the number that I mean they're trying.

282
00:17:03,196 --> 00:17:04,801
Scott: are they gonna put this on Netflix in Japan?

283
00:17:04,842 --> 00:17:08,059
Scott: I presume to try to get Netflix to be a thing in Japan and maybe it is a thing there.

284
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,319
Rym: all right I also make it global.

285
00:17:09,621 --> 00:17:12,991
Rym: But that number the reason this is a big deal is five billion.

286
00:17:13,252 --> 00:17:24,249
Rym: Netflix said next year alone and just in 2016 They're gonna spend five billion dollars on original content B. so Think about how.

287
00:17:24,289 --> 00:17:31,975
Rym: because there was that leak way back of all the like Licensing stuff and you all know all the nonsense about how little people who make anime actually get paid.

288
00:17:32,878 --> 00:17:43,192
Rym: if Netflix Gives even what they would consider a tiny budget to an existing anime studio like force Everyone's gonna go work at that studio all 4c.

289
00:17:43,273 --> 00:17:44,820
Scott: Definitely you got to pay them the big bucks.

290
00:17:46,104 --> 00:17:47,414
Scott: Well, actually that's the studio.

291
00:17:47,435 --> 00:17:52,539
Scott: if I was Netflix That's what I definitely would do is be like both see ghost in the shell up in the house.

292
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,346
Scott: here We go, but think about this.

293
00:17:54,607 --> 00:18:02,658
Rym: if Netflix gave what they would consider a small budget to an anime studio That would probably end up being the biggest budget any anime has ever had ever.

294
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:05,332
Scott: in fact You know well Akira had a huge, but I'd be like.

295
00:18:05,432 --> 00:18:05,553
Rym: well.

296
00:18:05,593 --> 00:18:06,016
Rym: Here's a movie.

297
00:18:06,036 --> 00:18:06,700
Rym: You're talking about shows.

298
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,590
Scott: Yeah, but yeah, you can make movies fucking - who cares?

299
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:12,120
Scott: yeah, I get like IG for C team up.

300
00:18:12,981 --> 00:18:15,573
Scott: Yeah, it's like you could just be like all star anime here.

301
00:18:15,613 --> 00:18:15,894
Scott: We go.

302
00:18:15,934 --> 00:18:17,180
Scott: I can just buy all your studios.

303
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:17,786
Scott: I'm Netflix.

304
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:18,331
Scott: you're tiny.

305
00:18:18,734 --> 00:18:21,410
Rym: yeah It's kind of a big deal.

306
00:18:21,511 --> 00:18:22,600
Rym: actually if this goes forward.

307
00:18:22,721 --> 00:18:28,313
Scott: I know right who knows whatever animes they make could be like anime of the century and couple this with the Hulu thing.

308
00:18:28,353 --> 00:18:36,420
Scott: and pretty much have Hulu and Netflix and Spent a lot more time talking about his news, but this news is a way bigger deal.

309
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,673
Scott: There's a lot less to say about it other than holy shit.

310
00:18:38,713 --> 00:18:39,276
Scott: Let's do it.

311
00:18:39,316 --> 00:18:39,819
Rym: come on.

312
00:18:40,181 --> 00:18:42,900
Rym: Well, it does kind of relate into the actual topic of the show.

313
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:44,633
Scott: Which is all you?

314
00:18:51,271 --> 00:18:52,675
Rym: Things of the day.

315
00:18:52,976 --> 00:18:59,013
Rym: so speaking of those Netflix shows one of the best ones in recent memory Bojack Horseman.

316
00:18:59,073 --> 00:19:09,843
Rym: Bojack is actually a super good show and if you don't know what Bojack is like you haven't seen it and You assume that it's something just based on like screenshots.

317
00:19:09,863 --> 00:19:15,299
Rym: You might have seen of the horseheaded guy or Maybe seeing the first episode and thinking it's like Archer or something.

318
00:19:15,379 --> 00:19:15,981
Rym: it is not.

319
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:17,687
Rym: it is a human drama.

320
00:19:17,807 --> 00:19:18,730
Rym: It's super good.

321
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,824
Rym: I highly recommend it.

322
00:19:20,148 --> 00:19:26,410
Rym: Emily And I like just went crazy and binged on the entire thing and now we're just waiting for the next season which is already confirmed.

323
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:30,396
Rym: but Cartoon hangover at Frederator.

324
00:19:30,697 --> 00:19:31,780
Rym: they've been doing a thing recently.

325
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,790
Rym: you might have seen these around a hundred and seven facts about something.

326
00:19:35,612 --> 00:19:36,961
Rym: These are actually super good videos.

327
00:19:37,021 --> 00:19:44,241
Rym: so my thing of the day is 107 Bojack Horseman facts And it's just a hundred and seven interesting things about Bojack Horseman.

328
00:19:44,261 --> 00:19:46,086
Rym: the show and it ranges from like.

329
00:19:46,347 --> 00:19:47,230
Rym: did you notice this thing in?

330
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:53,270
Rym: Background of this one episode - did you know this guy worked out it like Michael Eisner or something something like that kind of stuff.

331
00:19:54,273 --> 00:19:56,749
Rym: it's a Fascinating and it's only like 20 minutes long.

332
00:19:57,614 --> 00:20:05,000
Scott: Okay, so I didn't know about this until very recently But in 2014 there was this short Toy Story movie.

333
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,967
Scott: There was like 20 minutes long called Toy Story.

334
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:09,210
Scott: that time forgot.

335
00:20:10,256 --> 00:20:12,393
Scott: All right It's a TV.

336
00:20:12,514 --> 00:20:16,209
Scott: I think it was on TV, but I guess there's a booray now or something.

337
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:19,130
Scott: So you can watch this thing if you haven't seen it already.

338
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:25,050
Scott: Apparently despite only being like 20 minutes long it took them like forever to make it because it's Toy Story level quality.

339
00:20:25,272 --> 00:20:26,460
Scott: It's like 20 minutes long.

340
00:20:26,682 --> 00:20:42,730
Scott: right it was a big effort And it's sort of about this story Involving like these other toys that are called like the battle sores or something and you know they don't know that their toys and the Toy Story toys at the fight with them, or you know typical typical kind of story anyway.

341
00:20:44,012 --> 00:20:50,264
Scott: so You know this is fictional toy within the Toy Story world known as a battle sore.

342
00:20:50,685 --> 00:20:53,362
Scott: right that is this in this short 20-minute thing.

343
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,310
Scott: now Presumably if you're a toy in the Toy Story world you also have a cartoon right?

344
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:02,670
Scott: I'm sure there's a Buzz Lightyear cartoon that you can watch if you're in the Toy Story world.

345
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:07,709
Scott: so there's a. Theoretically there would also be a battle source cartoon.

346
00:21:08,412 --> 00:21:12,770
Scott: And what would the opener of that battle source cartoon look like if it existed well here?

347
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:13,072
Scott: It is.

348
00:21:13,132 --> 00:21:19,341
Scott: I'm not sure if this is actually part of that Movie the 20-minute movie or I heard.

349
00:21:19,401 --> 00:21:21,790
Scott: maybe this was just because I've only seen this video on YouTube.

350
00:21:22,733 --> 00:21:23,577
Scott: I think it was also.

351
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:37,281
Scott: may have just been a special feature on the bure if you got it Right, but what this is is theoretically the opener to battle sores right the Fictional toy in the fictional Toy Story universe.

352
00:21:37,602 --> 00:21:38,385
Rym: I'm kind of into that.

353
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:39,990
Scott: Why is this notable?

354
00:21:40,692 --> 00:21:42,759
Scott: Why do we care about this thing?

355
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,843
Scott: it's just a cute little.

356
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,850
Scott: animation is not very long right.

357
00:21:46,574 --> 00:21:57,381
Scott: it's like 44 seconds of animation because This 44 seconds of animation was animated by Studio trigger and therefore it is a thing of the day worthy.

358
00:21:57,682 --> 00:21:59,508
Rym: Yeah, that might save anime.

359
00:21:59,588 --> 00:22:00,089
Rym: That's right.

360
00:22:00,814 --> 00:22:03,190
Rym: So there you go in the meta moment.

361
00:22:03,551 --> 00:22:13,969
Rym: We have a patreon and you should back it listen to the show after the end of the credits because I Say the names of people back there and possibly do some dumb stuff, too.

362
00:22:14,991 --> 00:22:17,235
Scott: If you're really so foolish is to give us money.

363
00:22:17,256 --> 00:22:19,620
Scott: I'm not gonna tell you no, but I'm gonna be like why?

364
00:22:22,452 --> 00:22:23,739
Scott: Why we're using that?

365
00:22:23,819 --> 00:22:24,743
Scott: we have money.

366
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,030
Scott: Why are you giving us money?

367
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:30,424
Scott: well, you probably have less money than we have but you have more money than we have.

368
00:22:30,745 --> 00:22:35,220
Rym: call me if Everyone who listens to geek not just based on the stats.

369
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:40,418
Rym: I have gave us just one dollar one penny One penny one dollar a month.

370
00:22:40,438 --> 00:22:43,369
Rym: That's actually enough money to start funding like some cool stuff.

371
00:22:43,389 --> 00:22:48,970
Rym: and Also, we're gonna use this as an excuse to for real start up the you tennis show again.

372
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:53,613
Rym: I've already been doing some pre-production and we're making a bunch of other videos and content Like we're gonna start.

373
00:22:53,954 --> 00:22:57,827
Rym: the bigger that patreon gets the more things other than GeekNights.

374
00:22:57,847 --> 00:23:02,960
Scott: We're gonna do Also, you can buy GeekNights t-shirts made at Amazon store.

375
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,688
Scott: That's not a total waste of money, but it's still.

376
00:23:05,709 --> 00:23:18,190
Rym: it's Classic GeekNights shirt that actually we sold like a couple hundred of those things back in the day And I've hardly ever seen anyone wearing one ever Partly because we sold them a long time ago and we only go to a few cars.

377
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,436
Scott: How many of you sold an Amazon?

378
00:23:19,476 --> 00:23:20,742
Scott: so far of five?

379
00:23:20,923 --> 00:23:21,486
Scott: There you go.

380
00:23:21,506 --> 00:23:22,370
Scott: That's a good number.

381
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,479
Scott: Yeah, well cuz we relaunch.

382
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,514
Rym: what I expect now We don't have.

383
00:23:25,554 --> 00:23:26,137
Rym: we have class.

384
00:23:26,157 --> 00:23:28,268
Scott: wasn't one of those sold by you to you?

385
00:23:29,051 --> 00:23:30,155
Rym: Yeah, one of those I bought.

386
00:23:30,195 --> 00:23:32,985
Rym: so for I bought to make sure that they were good quality.

387
00:23:33,005 --> 00:23:33,567
Scott: Do you have it?

388
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:36,879
Rym: Uh No, it actually didn't arrive yet Isn't it from Amazon?

389
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,669
Scott: shouldn't be here in two days?

390
00:23:38,031 --> 00:23:41,870
Rym: No, because apparently so many people are doing the Amazon merch thing that they're way backed up.

391
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:45,001
Scott: Okay, but anyway, so yeah, uh, four people bought them good.

392
00:23:45,303 --> 00:23:46,648
Scott: Yeah, it shouldn't be a large number.

393
00:23:46,728 --> 00:23:47,290
Rym: It's no case shirt.

394
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:48,035
Rym: I like the shirt a lot.

395
00:23:48,076 --> 00:23:48,418
Rym: It's actually.

396
00:23:48,438 --> 00:23:49,889
Rym: it's a better poster, but it's pretty good shirt.

397
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:53,040
Rym: Yeah, if you wanted to share your geek that has posters left.

398
00:23:54,063 --> 00:23:56,310
Scott: Uh, yeah somewhere forgot that we made them until just now.

399
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:58,180
Rym: I was thinking about reprinting them because those are actually easy.

400
00:23:58,241 --> 00:23:59,870
Rym: I could have a box of posters in the apartment.

401
00:24:00,191 --> 00:24:04,890
Rym: I'm not gonna have a box of t-shirts across like 15 different sizes and two different colors.

402
00:24:05,412 --> 00:24:08,986
Scott: We should maybe we should make our website look like those posters instead of rebrand.

403
00:24:09,869 --> 00:24:11,821
Rym: Ah I would actually be kind of into that.

404
00:24:11,842 --> 00:24:13,150
Rym: Yeah, I like that style a lot.

405
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:14,556
Rym: Emily did that design right.

406
00:24:15,158 --> 00:24:16,564
Rym: the book club book was the Wheel of Time.

407
00:24:16,966 --> 00:24:17,930
Rym: we read the first book.

408
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,798
Rym: You should listen to that and read the first book.

409
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:22,490
Rym: We since read the first four books.

410
00:24:22,771 --> 00:24:28,570
Rym: We're gonna do a patreon backers only show of the first four books of the Wheel of Time.

411
00:24:29,112 --> 00:24:30,898
Rym: So you got to be giving us at least a dollar.

412
00:24:30,918 --> 00:24:35,536
Rym: you're not gonna hear that one unless someone pirates it which I guess I'm not gonna sue you.

413
00:24:35,656 --> 00:24:38,308
Scott: It'll still be Creative Commons licensed if you want to share it.

414
00:24:38,328 --> 00:24:40,557
Rym: Go ahead Yeah, but it'll only be in patreon.

415
00:24:40,577 --> 00:24:42,724
Scott: I guess we'll only link to it from there.

416
00:24:42,885 --> 00:24:44,129
Scott: So it's basically honor system.

417
00:24:44,992 --> 00:24:49,424
Scott: Yeah, I mean because really you're dumbass if you give us money, I don't really care.

418
00:24:50,005 --> 00:24:51,730
Rym: I've also I've pirated things in my life.

419
00:24:51,871 --> 00:24:56,226
Rym: So if someone pirates my stuff, I have basically no ground to stand on At all.

420
00:24:58,274 --> 00:25:00,324
Scott: You can't pirate something that's Creative Commons licensed.

421
00:25:00,546 --> 00:25:01,028
Rym: I am nothing.

422
00:25:01,088 --> 00:25:01,931
Rym: if not It's not.

423
00:25:01,992 --> 00:25:06,404
Rym: even if you don't if you don't give attribution, that's true motherfuckers.

424
00:25:06,725 --> 00:25:11,236
Scott: Yeah, I would be pissed if someone like You know Unattributed that would be like.

425
00:25:11,317 --> 00:25:31,050
Rym: really it's like I'm like I've found like websites that have our Content occasionally like a YouTube channel that has the audio from one of our episodes with a different title Not attributing us with one view, but the audio is there which has us attributing ourselves in it.

426
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:35,482
Scott: I guess if they ripped out us saying who we were and put it in something else.

427
00:25:35,563 --> 00:25:36,345
Scott: That would be weird.

428
00:25:36,425 --> 00:25:37,488
Rym: Yeah extra weird.

429
00:25:37,628 --> 00:25:41,015
Rym: Yeah Luckily, we're pretty We've done a lot.

430
00:25:41,095 --> 00:25:43,406
Rym: So it'd be really hard to pretend you were us at this point.

431
00:25:43,547 --> 00:25:43,788
Scott: Sure.

432
00:25:44,916 --> 00:25:49,522
Rym: And last but not least we are going to be at magfest Without me going to magfest.

433
00:25:49,582 --> 00:25:53,990
Rym: I'm gonna continue to sort that out But we're gonna be at a bunch of panels and probably do one or two lectures.

434
00:25:54,512 --> 00:25:55,516
Rym: So stay tuned.

435
00:25:55,536 --> 00:25:57,565
Scott: I'm mostly just gonna play games at magfest.

436
00:25:57,746 --> 00:25:58,790
Rym: Oh, yeah my modus operandi.

437
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,060
Scott: We should organize some of like our own tournament.

438
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:01,522
Scott: We should I?

439
00:26:01,542 --> 00:26:05,800
Scott: we should either do magical drop or You know Star Wars.

440
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,650
Rym: Oh, yeah, you want to do some for real tournaments?

441
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:15,913
Rym: Yes among us and ours because other than that and doing panels my modus operandi is getting space war Way way.

442
00:26:15,973 --> 00:26:18,079
Rym: Oh, we're gonna play a shit ton of space war.

443
00:26:18,219 --> 00:26:26,750
Rym: I tend to get way drunk at magfest wander around playing arcade games That's and at least one Eclipse game we should come up with like a point system.

444
00:26:27,117 --> 00:26:35,669
Scott: It's like, you know like this game of settlers is worth ten points for the winner and so and no points for anyone else and so on and then Keep score for all of magfest.

445
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:36,502
Rym: We will.

446
00:26:36,542 --> 00:26:39,806
Scott: if we're gonna do that We should make like a good and then we can declare a winner of magfest.

447
00:26:39,907 --> 00:26:42,599
Rym: in the very least We should make a Google form because people who for people

448
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,990
Scott: entering the game that they played who played who won

449
00:26:45,215 --> 00:26:46,032
Rym: exactly Cuz then

450
00:26:46,052 --> 00:26:48,583
Scott: I really need to know is game played who was in it and who won

451
00:26:48,724 --> 00:26:57,687
Rym: and that way we can after the fact Sit down and figure stuff out like alright Scott won like 50 games a wizard, but Rym won the Eclipse game.

452
00:26:58,331 --> 00:27:02,749
Scott: And we can also do stuff like play dig-dug whenever you feel like.

453
00:27:03,532 --> 00:27:07,610
Scott: Post your high score for the weekend and then we can see who is the best at dig-dug over there.

454
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:12,064
Rym: I almost kind of want to start a subterfuge game like three days before magfest.

455
00:27:12,284 --> 00:27:14,090
Scott: No, I don't think I'm gonna play subterfuge again.

456
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,864
Scott: It's just too time-consuming and distracting.

457
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:22,554
Scott: It's a good game But it's just like it eats your whole life and all your attention and it sort of messes up everything else in your life while You're playing one.

458
00:27:22,695 --> 00:27:24,630
Rym: There was a one moment where I remember I was laying in bed.

459
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:29,270
Rym: I was looking at subterfuge and I could see that Andrew was online.

460
00:27:29,431 --> 00:27:32,164
Scott: I turned off the notifications for the last two days and that was great cuz.

461
00:27:32,184 --> 00:27:35,870
Scott: I only checked it like twice a day And he didn't mess my life up anymore.

462
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:40,230
Scott: But I really couldn't do anything much and I'd open it up and be like, oh look at all the shit that happened.

463
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:40,852
Scott: Fuck me.

464
00:27:41,334 --> 00:27:42,718
Scott: You couldn't win doing it like that.

465
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:43,361
Rym: Yeah.

466
00:27:43,903 --> 00:27:44,043
Rym: Yeah.

467
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:54,237
Rym: Well you you mr Literally everyone told me that you tried to make an alliance of everyone against Rym immediately But that's neither here nor there.

468
00:27:54,277 --> 00:27:55,765
Rym: That's GeekNights Tuesdays.

469
00:27:55,846 --> 00:28:00,020
Rym: This is GeekNights Wednesdays, so I don't know how long this will actually be.

470
00:28:00,362 --> 00:28:05,390
Scott: but this topic is something that He thought it was a good idea for a show and I have nothing to say.

471
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:07,161
Rym: I didn't have a better idea for a show.

472
00:28:07,181 --> 00:28:08,590
Scott: You know, I have better ideas for shows.

473
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:11,370
Scott: You just haven't read or watched any of the things that are better ideas for shit.

474
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:14,510
Rym: You haven't read or watched any of the things that I also have better ideas for show.

475
00:28:15,414 --> 00:28:16,470
Rym: So that's the problem.

476
00:28:16,932 --> 00:28:22,170
Rym: We I guess we'd go to the Dave and Joel format of we watch completely separate things and review them separately next to each other.

477
00:28:22,532 --> 00:28:24,281
Scott: But I just gave the things that I just read.

478
00:28:24,321 --> 00:28:25,307
Scott: I just gave to you to read.

479
00:28:25,327 --> 00:28:27,521
Rym: you're gonna read them I'm gonna read them then we'll do the thing on them.

480
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:33,200
Rym: So but so Recently, I've decided that I'm gonna change the way.

481
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:36,530
Rym: I talk about something very specific and that is anime and manga.

482
00:28:37,511 --> 00:28:46,844
Rym: I'm not gonna use the word manga anymore and I'm at all Pretty much, I'm not gonna use the words anime and manga when I talk about this stuff

483
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:48,468
Scott: because you just did yeah

484
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:54,389
Rym: and I'm trying I'm gonna try to break away from that because I don't think calling something anime

485
00:28:54,409 --> 00:28:54,469
Scott: and

486
00:28:55,750 --> 00:29:02,070
Rym: Meaning that it is Japanese animation made in Japan is a worthwhile distinction anymore.

487
00:29:02,451 --> 00:29:02,932
Scott: I don't care.

488
00:29:02,953 --> 00:29:04,277
Rym: Yeah, but that that's it.

489
00:29:04,317 --> 00:29:04,798
Rym: I don't care.

490
00:29:04,818 --> 00:29:08,449
Scott: I mean, it's useful to me because you know that it makes the.

491
00:29:09,633 --> 00:29:11,590
Scott: It makes like when I'm searching for a show to watch.

492
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:15,590
Scott: It makes a lot more organized if that's separated out the animes from the not animes.

493
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:15,811
Scott: But

494
00:29:15,851 --> 00:29:20,109
Rym: the majority of the animation I watch is not anime and in a lot of the rest of the world

495
00:29:20,149 --> 00:29:20,934
Scott: for me It is and

496
00:29:20,954 --> 00:29:28,076
Rym: in a lot of the rest of the world as we've often done It talked about in our panels like in Italy Anime, they call Adventure Time.

497
00:29:28,156 --> 00:29:30,865
Rym: anime just means animation usually foreign animation.

498
00:29:31,246 --> 00:29:34,050
Scott: So Sailor Moon fan subs I don't think there's too much Italian animation.

499
00:29:34,252 --> 00:29:35,204
Scott: I mean, there's got to be some.

500
00:29:35,265 --> 00:29:36,092
Scott: but yeah I've never heard.

501
00:29:36,112 --> 00:29:39,067
Rym: but Sailor Moon fan subs are next to like that you want.

502
00:29:39,107 --> 00:29:42,510
Scott: if you have you know The awesome Italian animation hook me up because I want to see it.

503
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:46,602
Scott: In fact the same goes if you know the best animations from any country.

504
00:29:46,843 --> 00:29:51,135
Scott: that isn't Japan the United States France or Ireland or Russia.

505
00:29:51,476 --> 00:29:52,299
Scott: Those are all the countries.

506
00:29:52,339 --> 00:29:53,863
Scott: I've seen good animations from.

507
00:29:54,265 --> 00:29:56,913
Scott: if you have good animations from other countries I know they exist.

508
00:29:57,495 --> 00:29:58,679
Scott: Please tell me I want to watch them.

509
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,344
Rym: but so answer man.

510
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:03,459
Scott: actually today Canada Canadian I was also.

511
00:30:03,479 --> 00:30:04,184
Scott: I've seen their enemy.

512
00:30:04,224 --> 00:30:05,130
Rym: Yeah, there's a lot of animation.

513
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:05,585
Rym: Yeah, okay.

514
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:17,330
Rym: so answer man today actually because I read this earlier has an article that was sort of got me thinking about this concept and the Question was you should read answer man, by the way, if you're an anime fan, I'm gonna keep saying anime.

515
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:18,396
Rym: I'm just gonna mean something.

516
00:30:18,477 --> 00:30:20,449
Rym: I can't stop saying anime.

517
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:23,557
Rym: The Christopher asked the answer.

518
00:30:23,597 --> 00:30:31,290
Rym: man with the anime otaku industry being a fairly robust fandom in the West I was wondering is that mirrored for Western animation cartoons over in Japan?

519
00:30:31,531 --> 00:30:35,750
Scott: Well, we Emily's told us that they have Cartoon Network in Japan and the dubs are really good.

520
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:40,010
Scott: Yeah, but I've seen some Dexter's lab Japanese and man the dub is really good?

521
00:30:40,134 --> 00:30:40,731
Rym: Yeah it is.

522
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:51,405
Rym: but are there groups that work on fan subbing episodes of things like you see the universe or No, because they just have dubs of everything on their real TV like Simpson like they know.

523
00:30:51,506 --> 00:30:52,790
Scott: Simpsons are everywhere in the world.

524
00:30:52,973 --> 00:30:53,927
Scott: It's not like you know.

525
00:30:54,733 --> 00:30:56,761
Rym: But he but the question card you never chose.

526
00:30:56,782 --> 00:30:57,866
Scott: everywhere in the world Disney shows.

527
00:30:57,967 --> 00:31:01,830
Rym: everywhere in the world Is there a fan culture like we have in the u.s.

528
00:31:02,412 --> 00:31:07,229
Rym: And his answer is something that I've seen mirrored in other places and echoed around the world is that?

529
00:31:07,309 --> 00:31:17,441
Rym: no It's pretty much only Americans that go like apeshit and weird about anime fandom Like anime fandom being its own things separate in the u.s.

530
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:20,750
Rym: Fandom of animation specifically and only from Japan.

531
00:31:21,515 --> 00:31:24,010
Rym: That doesn't really happen everywhere else.

532
00:31:24,411 --> 00:31:28,990
Rym: It's just America that does this to the degree that it does because a community arose, right?

533
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:31,447
Scott: It's it's because the history right is.

534
00:31:31,507 --> 00:31:34,307
Rym: there was You know World War two, right?

535
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:45,301
Rym: Well band military brats and military servicemen coming back to the States having watched a bunch of anime while they were stationed there Right and they formed a communities in the United States to watch this stuff.

536
00:31:45,742 --> 00:31:52,143
Scott: Whereas other countries say, I don't know like France It's like they didn't get the anime as early as we did.

537
00:31:52,183 --> 00:31:54,150
Scott: there wasn't a community there formed around it.

538
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:56,486
Scott: They got it when it started being exported.

539
00:31:56,526 --> 00:32:00,422
Scott: the same way It's being exported now and it was just to everyone at once.

540
00:32:00,703 --> 00:32:02,570
Scott: suddenly, you know, they went from zero to hero.

541
00:32:02,971 --> 00:32:08,145
Scott: we had this in-between part where there was a this, you know society built around it and the.

542
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:17,899
Scott: the current anime culture in the United States is simply the enlargement and you know Evolution of that original community that did not exist elsewhere

543
00:32:18,059 --> 00:32:35,590
Rym: notice the primary complaint from anime fans who actually care about anime specifically from Japan when it comes to fan culture that the fan culture of anime in the US is if you Look at the convention scene the forum scene anything like that has expanded to include pretty much all.

544
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:40,790
Rym: Animation like Steven Universe stuff was is one of the biggest cosplays at anime cons in the u.s.

545
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:49,905
Scott: That's the kind of thing is talked about because a lot of the people now who happen to like anime they are not Originally coming from that, you know community.

546
00:32:49,985 --> 00:32:56,670
Scott: They're coming it You know, they're just fans of animation who are coming into the community from the outside to go to the convention.

547
00:32:57,232 --> 00:33:01,710
Scott: So imagine they didn't grow from you know, a fan sub place, you know.

548
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:17,066
Rym: imagine anime fan conventions in a world where that generic outside influence never came in and Anime cons would basically be identical to like Star Trek cons and sci-fi cons the deep

549
00:33:17,127 --> 00:33:17,488
Scott: some of them

550
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:31,057
Rym: are yeah Deeply insular kind of like really outside of mainstream culture kind of weird and kind of inaccessible to outsiders, but instead anime cons became animation comic

551
00:33:31,177 --> 00:33:31,680
Scott: cons

552
00:33:31,761 --> 00:33:47,910
Rym: in a super general sense and I actually realized something and I hadn't thought about before because for a while like I've vacillated between Anime cons should probably focus on anime and let generic conventions like ConnectiCon be the fans of whatever conventions.

553
00:33:48,970 --> 00:34:03,806
Rym: But in that world there is almost no reason to have an anime con anymore at all Like even less of a reason than have sci-fi cons because there's so few Actual anime that would come out where someone would have interesting content to present.

554
00:34:03,846 --> 00:34:04,970
Rym: like there's no reason to have a panel.

555
00:34:05,313 --> 00:34:06,947
Rym: How many times can you talk about Evangelion?

556
00:34:08,476 --> 00:34:15,790
Scott: Hmm I mean the reason the conventions existed in the u.s In the first place was in order to like copy all your fan sub tapes with other people.

557
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:17,976
Scott: Yep, right, so we don't need to do that anymore.

558
00:34:18,318 --> 00:34:18,920
Scott: And then it was.

559
00:34:19,001 --> 00:34:22,981
Scott: well, even though we have you know, anime available It's not widely available.

560
00:34:23,001 --> 00:34:23,869
Scott: We'll screen it here.

561
00:34:24,251 --> 00:34:27,844
Scott: Well now you can just watch it on Hulu all of it and and then it was.

562
00:34:28,206 --> 00:34:29,370
Rym: this is a niche fandom.

563
00:34:29,733 --> 00:34:37,670
Rym: so if you want like lit crit or Analysis or like lectures or like academic interesting content anime consoles where was that?

564
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:38,853
Rym: like you'd go see Fred Schott.

565
00:34:38,873 --> 00:34:39,274
Rym: reason

566
00:34:39,293 --> 00:35:00,799
Scott: for an anime condom exist is for anime fans to get together and be with each other and have a good time and Cosplay because you can't really do that anywhere or take pictures of cosplay and do other fun events that you can't do Unless you're physically with other people like maybe play some games and those sorts of things and all the other things that do happen Don't really need to happen.

567
00:35:00,879 --> 00:35:03,171
Scott: that there can just be on YouTube or you know They don't.

568
00:35:03,553 --> 00:35:03,935
Scott: it's like there's.

569
00:35:03,955 --> 00:35:07,090
Scott: no you don't need to have the con for those things to happen.

570
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:12,690
Scott: So it's like yeah, you can have your con but it you know, and I guess that you know that you to meet guests.

571
00:35:12,871 --> 00:35:17,430
Scott: Right, there are people that you can see an anime con even though people mostly seem to care about the American voice actors.

572
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:19,942
Scott: But that's but I mean that's still a reason to go right?

573
00:35:19,982 --> 00:35:20,324
Scott: is this?

574
00:35:20,344 --> 00:35:31,670
Scott: their people will come Who oh, you know and make a public appearance and you want to enjoy their public appearance and have them entertain you and they need To be paid to do that and a con will bring up the money from all your entry fees in order to make that happen.

575
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:36,484
Rym: So in the modern era why not have the Steven Universe fandom also there.

576
00:35:36,545 --> 00:35:38,330
Rym: Is there any good reason why not?

577
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,394
Scott: No, I mean there was a matter.

578
00:35:40,434 --> 00:35:45,150
Scott: it's Pete, you know people getting together in a place to enjoy what they enjoy.

579
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:56,390
Scott: So if you know there if people if all the people who enjoy say a also enjoy be like I imagine Most of the people who like Adventure Time probably like Steven Universe.

580
00:35:56,491 --> 00:35:59,810
Scott: How many people are there that are like Adventure Time only or Steven Universe only actually?

581
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:06,070
Rym: What's weird is a lot of people who are deep into Adventure Time that I see and even some people we know Once they saw Steven Universe.

582
00:36:06,492 --> 00:36:12,013
Rym: It's like they forgot what Adventure Time was and decided Steven Universe is great and Adventure Time sucks Because it vented.

583
00:36:12,073 --> 00:36:18,850
Rym: I'm suck there because Steven Universe has a straight forward direct narrative and Adventure Time is cool and experimental.

584
00:36:19,591 --> 00:36:22,010
Rym: Anyway, yeah, but I've had some arguments.

585
00:36:23,274 --> 00:36:26,103
Scott: You liked it for all those years and now suddenly you just change your mind.

586
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:28,150
Rym: Yeah, I've had some arguments.

587
00:36:30,112 --> 00:36:32,950
Scott: That's like the people who are like can we be up was good until it got popular.

588
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:34,054
Scott: It's like that guy.

589
00:36:34,295 --> 00:36:35,701
Scott: the show is the same show.

590
00:36:35,761 --> 00:36:36,705
Scott: It doesn't change.

591
00:36:36,765 --> 00:36:38,070
Scott: It's the same animation.

592
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:40,144
Scott: It can't change quality doesn't change over time.

593
00:36:40,405 --> 00:36:41,090
Scott: Yeah anyway.

594
00:36:43,572 --> 00:36:44,658
Rym: So here's here's what I'm getting at.

595
00:36:44,678 --> 00:37:06,870
Rym: the only distinction between Anime anime at an anime con and Steven Universe and anime con is that the people and studio that made that anime were owned by a Japanese interest in Japan and I had to be kind of circumspect there because a lot of animation gets outsourced to Korea.

596
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:08,716
Scott: Is that anime now or other places?

597
00:37:08,756 --> 00:37:12,950
Rym: Yeah, so if the only distinction is this specific?

598
00:37:14,296 --> 00:37:24,824
Rym: View of made by Japanese people in Japan Which is being blurred by the fact that the world is modern and global Then the only reason to have an anime con that exactly

599
00:37:24,844 --> 00:37:30,270
Scott: you have to admit that what you know It's not necessarily the fact that it was made in Japan in Japan by Japanese people.

600
00:37:30,732 --> 00:37:40,770
Scott: It's that the kind of an animation that is made By, you know for a Japanese audience not even necessarily by Japanese people or by Japanese studio, right?

601
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:57,350
Scott: That is you know called anime Duh has certain genres tropes styles, even though I know that there's no uniform anime style true But I but there are certain tropes and certain characteristics of those animations versus other animations.

602
00:37:58,392 --> 00:38:02,610
Scott: Not that other animations of other countries don't you know completely exclude those tropes.

603
00:38:02,791 --> 00:38:05,450
Rym: But so what about shows like walk through?

604
00:38:05,932 --> 00:38:15,682
Rym: From France that have all those tropes and might as well be an anime except they're not made in Japan Like they're in that same, you know quote-unquote bad show.

605
00:38:15,703 --> 00:38:16,224
Scott: I don't like it.

606
00:38:16,345 --> 00:38:17,970
Rym: Yeah, but I'm saying it has all those tropes.

607
00:38:18,291 --> 00:38:20,100
Rym: Why is that not welcome that an anime con?

608
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,125
Rym: because again you're getting back to this.

609
00:38:21,145 --> 00:38:22,230
Scott: Why would you not welcome it?

610
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:22,835
Rym: It's not.

611
00:38:22,896 --> 00:38:26,779
Rym: it's not anime The people who want to make the definition.

612
00:38:26,799 --> 00:38:33,089
Rym: I feel like there's no purpose for anime cons being restricted based on Japan.

613
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:35,875
Scott: Hmm it's a conventions.

614
00:38:35,935 --> 00:38:39,327
Scott: people are getting together to have a good time and enjoy the culture that they share.

615
00:38:39,668 --> 00:38:43,230
Scott: if this culture that They share they will enjoy it in that space that they come together.

616
00:38:43,691 --> 00:38:44,414
Scott: It's not about.

617
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:47,904
Scott: but you know, it's not the culture that part doesn't come first.

618
00:38:48,305 --> 00:38:49,730
Scott: It's the people come first, right?

619
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:52,161
Scott: It's you get the like-minded people whatever they have.

620
00:38:52,221 --> 00:38:54,029
Scott: like-minded is what they're gonna do.

621
00:38:54,411 --> 00:39:00,050
Scott: Right if you went to a sci-fi con a while a long time ago It would have been like mostly Star Trek shit and Ray Bradbury shit.

622
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:04,745
Scott: And if you go to one now, it's probably gonna be like the exact same people and nothing's changed.

623
00:39:05,347 --> 00:39:05,668
Rym: maybe.

624
00:39:05,688 --> 00:39:07,348
Rym: but yeah I've been to sci-fi cons.

625
00:39:08,552 --> 00:39:11,473
Scott: It's like, you know this newer like if you go to fantasy con It's like they're.

626
00:39:11,513 --> 00:39:16,829
Scott: you know, maybe before they were all Lord of the Rings and now they're all Game of Thrones And it's just you know, the things change.

627
00:39:17,231 --> 00:39:22,850
Scott: But it's those people whatever the people that are coming to the convention that community whatever that community that's getting together enjoys.

628
00:39:23,274 --> 00:39:32,204
Scott: That's what they're gonna celebrate while they're there Even if even if you kept it to just anime it used to be for my Locomist and then it was Naruto and now it's something else.

629
00:39:32,285 --> 00:39:42,150
Rym: It's like okay last night Emily and I were watching a whole bunch of AMVs and It that was interesting because at this point I feel like people still call and like they say AMV.

630
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:51,808
Rym: But most of the new things like that they're being made are all to like Steven Universe and Adventure Time and Bojack and stuff Like that, okay, and but I found remember that older right now one.

631
00:39:51,828 --> 00:39:56,290
Rym: Yeah That was like the biggest deal AMV back in the day because none of the shows in that anyone.

632
00:39:56,653 --> 00:40:02,421
Rym: Oh, no, we were watching it and Emily and I were like, wow Literally no one in anime con would know who the fuck Ryoga is like.

633
00:40:02,481 --> 00:40:06,987
Rym: this doesn't make any sense to anyone in the modern era except us old people.

634
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:09,618
Rym: So it's I guess you're.

635
00:40:09,638 --> 00:40:13,717
Rym: it's hard to stop saying anime Because it's so widely used.

636
00:40:13,757 --> 00:40:16,830
Rym: but I'm no longer gonna call manga mock comics or comics.

637
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:26,710
Rym: I'm just gonna call any sort of like sequential art like that a comic not gonna try to make a distinction For manga just because it was made on the eye in the islands of Japan.

638
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:28,761
Scott: I don't just think it because it's made in Japan.

639
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:36,189
Scott: I just think manga because When manga is produced in a different way, right then paying people even less.

640
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:37,992
Scott: Well, yes paying people even less.

641
00:40:38,032 --> 00:40:50,698
Scott: but the fact that it's weekly and in black and white and produced rapidly right results in You know a different, you know There are certain qualities that you will get in that kind of production that you do not get in.

642
00:40:51,462 --> 00:40:54,640
Scott: You know a comic made in the US and Marvel where it's a monthly pamphlet.

643
00:40:54,820 --> 00:41:03,991
Scott: Yeah, but it's a different result doing things that way and therefore even though it's still sequential art That makes it a different genre.

644
00:41:04,353 --> 00:41:10,836
Scott: not the fact that it's from Japan But the fact the way it's produced was you know causes certain characteristics that make it a different genre.

645
00:41:11,257 --> 00:41:15,900
Scott: or at least, you know Section even if you like I both have superheroes like a superhero is a genre.

646
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:26,260
Scott: you could have a superhero manga and an American superhero comic, but the superhero manga will be Significantly different but you could say the same the American version because of that distinction.

647
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,248
Rym: Like there are words to talk about French comics.

648
00:41:28,309 --> 00:41:30,658
Rym: French comics have the same thing like on day dizzy name.

649
00:41:30,699 --> 00:41:35,120
Scott: Yeah Yeah, that's why they call them bond a dizzy name because I'm probably pronouncing that wrong.

650
00:41:35,161 --> 00:41:35,858
Rym: That's close enough.

651
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:39,111
Scott: But here's a big fancy ass book and it's like.

652
00:41:39,191 --> 00:41:40,696
Scott: the way they produce it is so different.

653
00:41:40,716 --> 00:41:42,444
Scott: you get a different result that you would never see.

654
00:41:42,725 --> 00:41:49,160
Scott: but someone making a comic in the US although people in America I mean in the US could make an album just like the way the French do they just don't.

655
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:52,949
Rym: But most people in America even comics fans even people who know a lot about it.

656
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:56,900
Rym: Don't call them bond as they call them comics.

657
00:41:57,541 --> 00:41:58,405
Scott: Calm bond, isn't it?

658
00:41:58,485 --> 00:41:59,229
Rym: You do you're weird.

659
00:41:59,550 --> 00:41:59,912
Scott: That's all.

660
00:41:59,952 --> 00:42:03,476
Scott: but the thing is when I get a French comic It's not in that format anymore.

661
00:42:03,536 --> 00:42:03,778
Scott: Is it?

662
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:07,880
Scott: It's in like a trade paperback if it was still in that big-ass book.

663
00:42:07,961 --> 00:42:10,218
Scott: I thought use that word to refer to those big-ass books.

664
00:42:10,258 --> 00:42:14,280
Rym: Yeah I've seen a lot of those that are.

665
00:42:16,566 --> 00:42:27,214
Rym: When I was in high school taking French class there was a kid name was Sean and We had to pick French names for the class, you know, like language classes name from us.

666
00:42:27,495 --> 00:42:38,815
Rym: So he was like croissant and the teachers like you can't call yourself croissant and he Made a big fucking deal about that and eventually like the school said alright fine.

667
00:42:39,196 --> 00:42:40,660
Rym: He can call himself croissant.

668
00:42:40,821 --> 00:42:42,153
Rym: you can't stop it croissant.

669
00:42:42,738 --> 00:42:48,896
Rym: and That like I. just I called that guy croissant for like four years even outside class.

670
00:42:49,077 --> 00:42:52,759
Rym: Yeah a-plus My hero it became his name.

671
00:42:53,846 --> 00:42:54,578
Scott: What's up croissant?

672
00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:01,704
Rym: And on that note we killed enough time with the topic of little piston people off and will have Consumed.

673
00:43:01,724 --> 00:43:02,952
Scott: him seems to care a lot about this.

674
00:43:02,992 --> 00:43:05,524
Scott: I don't give a shit Wilkins Wilkins I just it's.

675
00:43:05,544 --> 00:43:10,380
Rym: I feel like anime cons that try to focus on just Japan in the u.s.

676
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:11,423
Rym: In the modern era.

677
00:43:12,084 --> 00:43:15,714
Rym: edge into this like fetishizing Japan area.

678
00:43:15,774 --> 00:43:18,200
Scott: people have been fetishizing Japan for a long ass time.

679
00:43:18,716 --> 00:43:29,656
Rym: Yeah Since I discovered that it existed and I feel like there's almost zero value to conventions around that in the modern Era, I mean Yeah, yeah.

680
00:43:32,102 --> 00:43:37,820
Rym: But now we'll have consumed some shared media and we'll have a topic of a review of some kind on the next Wednesday.

681
00:43:42,315 --> 00:43:44,850
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
