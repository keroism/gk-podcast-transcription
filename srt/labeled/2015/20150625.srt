1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,527
Rym: It's Thursday, June 25th, 2015.

2
00:00:10,527 --> 00:00:10,747
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,004 --> 00:00:14,356
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,050
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight.

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:17,520
Rym: We are talking about furniture!

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:19,089
Rym: Exciting!

7
00:00:20,601 --> 00:00:22,038
Scott: We're kind of old now.

8
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:25,418
Scott: Let's do this.

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,040
Scott: So Rym, what did you say that, you know, your rib cage, right?

10
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:39,340
Scott: It's got like two halves that are sort of lung-shaped and then, you know, the two sort of half circle bits, they come, you know, they meet together at the bottom.

11
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,320
Rym: Oh yeah, like you have the solar plexus or whatever.

12
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,489
Scott: Yeah, what did you say?

13
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:43,659
Scott: the name of that area was?

14
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,199
Rym: The hypochondrias?

15
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:51,980
Scott: Yeah, so it's like I got some weird feelings in there lately for like the past few days.

16
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,419
Rym: Oh, it looks like it's actually the hypochondriac region.

17
00:00:56,002 --> 00:01:02,620
Rym: It appears to be the origin of the word hypochondria because that's the place where generic pain that may or may not be bullshit just appears.

18
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:12,100
Scott: Yeah, so I've been having like, I wouldn't call it pain because I'm not like ow or suffering, but it's like I'm having discomforts and strange feelings.

19
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,080
Rym: Well, I did Google search for baby hands grabbing the inside of my rib cage.

20
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:29,140
Scott: Yeah, I don't know, and it's like, well, if you search for chest pain, which I guess, right, it's like the internet's like go to the hospital immediately, you could be having a heart attack and there's no way to know unless you go to the ER, don't die.

21
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,500
Scott: And I'm like, well, it's been three days and I just biked over the bridge like four times.

22
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:38,920
Rym: I feel like you gotta be at least 15 or so more years older before that.

23
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,140
Rym: Chest pain equals heart attack is something you gotta really think about.

24
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,280
Scott: Yeah, I'm like, if I'm having a heart attack, I would be falling on the floor, right?

25
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,736
Rym: There are like weird partial heart attacks that have happened to people, but again, I don't think you have.

26
00:01:50,701 --> 00:01:52,710
Scott: Anyway, so I don't think that's a problem.

27
00:01:52,851 --> 00:01:54,800
Scott: I guess what else could it be like heartburn?

28
00:01:54,900 --> 00:02:00,280
Scott: I've never had heartburn in my life and I've tried, I took a Tums and it didn't do anything.

29
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:08,460
Rym: Well, I've realized that's an interesting problem where there's certain kinds of pain that are very easy to like describe or like certain kinds of discomfort that you might have.

30
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,974
Rym: So like if I have a headache, I can be like, I have a fucking headache.

31
00:02:12,316 --> 00:02:13,200
Rym: It really hurts.

32
00:02:13,741 --> 00:02:23,500
Rym: But then there's like, if I have to describe what a heartburn feels like to another human being, it's actually kind of hard to describe it in a satisfactory manner.

33
00:02:24,282 --> 00:02:32,440
Rym: So I always wonder, like if I have a lot of weird pains that I didn't have before, are they things that everyone has when they're my age?

34
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,840
Scott: I'm pretty sure, I'm pretty sure a lot of this is just oldening, right?

35
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,670
Rym: Yeah, exactly.

36
00:02:36,115 --> 00:02:36,560
Rym: Exactly.

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,079
Scott: But it's still, I'd rather not feel this right now.

38
00:02:40,582 --> 00:02:42,214
Scott: And really all I need is confirmation.

39
00:02:42,254 --> 00:02:42,960
Scott: I'm not dying.

40
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,299
Rym: I think you just need to go to the doctor and be like, hey.

41
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,800
Scott: But if I see it now, I would just go to the doctor.

42
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:51,280
Scott: And if I was in some country with just awesome healthcare, I would just go to the doctor.

43
00:02:51,821 --> 00:02:54,780
Scott: But in this country, going to the doctor is a huge pain in my ass.

44
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,940
Rym: Yeah, I'll tell you guys the story.

45
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:59,080
Scott: So if I go to the doctor for no fucking reason, it's like, God damn it.

46
00:02:59,260 --> 00:02:59,918
Rym: So I have two stories.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,900
Scott: If I die because I didn't go to the doctor, well, God damn it.

48
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:09,860
Rym: That is one of the leading causes of death in men is untreated rectal cancer, because guys just don't go to the doctor in the US.

49
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,580
Scott: Well, I mean, if you have rectal cancer, you could have some pretty big butt problems.

50
00:03:14,601 --> 00:03:16,380
Rym: Yeah, but a lot of those symptoms get ignored.

51
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:20,120
Rym: Men in the US, like statistically, just don't go to the doctor until it's way too late.

52
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,980
Scott: Isn't at some point blood going to come out of your asshole?

53
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,120
Rym: Well, blood will come out for a lot of things, actually.

54
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:30,900
Scott: Sure, but I mean, if blood comes out your asshole for any reason, except eating Chipotle, you're going to the doctor like the next day.

55
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,279
Scott: That's not something we need to be like.

56
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,060
Scott: Do I need to go to the doctor or not?

57
00:03:35,061 --> 00:03:40,560
Scott: Like vague, vague discomfort in the hypochondrias is a is questionable.

58
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,999
Scott: Whether you should go to the doctor.

59
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:42,957
Rym: I would think about it.

60
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,240
Rym: Everyone, if they have vague discomfort in the hypochondrias, gets to go to the doctor once.

61
00:03:49,721 --> 00:03:52,260
Rym: Because then, you know, because there's only three outcomes.

62
00:03:52,602 --> 00:03:54,320
Rym: Yes, you have pancreatic cancer.

63
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:54,979
Rym: We're sorry.

64
00:03:55,462 --> 00:03:56,177
Rym: You've got a month.

65
00:03:57,743 --> 00:03:58,669
Rym: It's no, you've gotten.

66
00:03:58,689 --> 00:04:00,520
Rym: there's nothing wrong with you and that'll go away.

67
00:04:00,781 --> 00:04:02,290
Rym: It's this X thing and it'll disappear.

68
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:03,919
Rym: or there's nothing wrong with you.

69
00:04:04,425 --> 00:04:04,854
Rym: Suck it up.

70
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:05,800
Rym: That sucks.

71
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,459
Rym: Come back in a month and we'll tell you the same thing.

72
00:04:09,363 --> 00:04:10,517
Rym: I don't know what to do about that.

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,140
Rym: Yeah.

74
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:16,140
Rym: But so when I had Lyme disease way back, you know, I had a headache for like a month.

75
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:23,280
Scott: I mean, if a headache lasts more than a few days and doesn't go away, I at least think I have migraines and I'm going to try to get help with my migraine.

76
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:23,719
Rym: But that's it.

77
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,980
Rym: I've had headaches that last.

78
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,280
Rym: And that's pain, right?

79
00:04:26,481 --> 00:04:29,780
Scott: Like if I had pain in the hypochondria, it's like, ow, ow, ow.

80
00:04:29,881 --> 00:04:30,460
Scott: I'm suffering.

81
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,919
Scott: I would at least want pain reliever.

82
00:04:33,968 --> 00:04:36,160
Scott: I would go to the doctor or perhaps even the ER.

83
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,180
Scott: Like, but if it's just strange discomfort, like maybe it's a ball of gas.

84
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:45,320
Scott: Like if I drink water, like while I'm drinking water, it feels good.

85
00:04:45,381 --> 00:04:46,940
Scott: So maybe it's something in my esophagus.

86
00:04:48,863 --> 00:04:52,582
Rym: You know, in that region, there's a thing that can happen with a prolapse at the top of the stomach.

87
00:04:52,603 --> 00:04:58,968
Rym: that I know about because way back when I had like serious heartburn doctor described all these horrible things.

88
00:04:59,029 --> 00:05:01,380
Rym: that could be wrong and we're causing the heartburn.

89
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,800
Rym: But then in the end he was like, actually just sleep more and it'll all go away.

90
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,959
Scott: I've been sleeping a lot lately.

91
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,420
Rym: So in retrospect, I waited a couple, like two weeks before I went to the doctor with that headache because it wasn't like the worst headache.

92
00:05:13,501 --> 00:05:14,460
Scott: I rarely have headaches.

93
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,880
Scott: So if I have a headache that lasts more than like hours, I will go to a doctor.

94
00:05:20,383 --> 00:05:25,040
Rym: If I run like a hard half marathon, I'll have a headache for like the entire next day.

95
00:05:26,707 --> 00:05:27,975
Scott: Uh, that's probably a sign.

96
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:28,600
Scott: you shouldn't do that.

97
00:05:28,747 --> 00:05:28,898
Scott: No.

98
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,940
Rym: Well, that's why I'm never going to run a marathon marathon.

99
00:05:31,327 --> 00:05:31,560
Scott: Okay.

100
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,400
Scott: I'll just get a headache, but I'm not going to run.

101
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:43,000
Rym: But at the other time when I, you know, this is a personal story, but I had a lymph node, you know, in my groin, like on your thigh, like in the leg area, like that area.

102
00:05:43,781 --> 00:05:47,739
Rym: And that lymph node swelled up one day, like about a year ago, real big.

103
00:05:48,242 --> 00:05:49,680
Scott: How big, like baseball, golf?

104
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,274
Rym: No, no, no.

105
00:05:50,581 --> 00:05:52,019
Rym: Like a large grape.

106
00:05:53,064 --> 00:05:53,659
Scott: That's not big.

107
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,690
Scott: I have a lump in my arm.

108
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,760
Scott: that's grape size.

109
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:56,458
Rym: No, I'm not big.

110
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,700
Rym: So more like, oh, you didn't watch for your globe grape.

111
00:06:00,001 --> 00:06:04,320
Rym: Like big enough to where I looked at it and thought, wow, that's probably cancer.

112
00:06:04,686 --> 00:06:04,939
Rym: Okay.

113
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:05,560
Rym: And it was great.

114
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,079
Rym: It seemed to be growing rapidly.

115
00:06:07,551 --> 00:06:07,759
Rym: All right.

116
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:18,560
Rym: So it actually took me because the American healthcare system, a full month to get an appointment with someone who could look at it other than a GP who said, yeah, you should get an appointment with the specialist.

117
00:06:19,386 --> 00:06:20,020
Rym: So that was fun.

118
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,299
Rym: So I had it for a month.

119
00:06:23,222 --> 00:06:26,040
Rym: I got an appointment for, I went to get a doctor's appointment.

120
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,180
Rym: Another month went by because it takes forever.

121
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,159
Scott: Could have been dead by then.

122
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:35,460
Rym: And in the last week of that month, like literally a few days for the appointment, fucking thing just went away.

123
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,180
Rym: It was gone.

124
00:06:36,561 --> 00:06:39,000
Rym: I went to the doctor and I was like, yeah, I have nothing.

125
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,020
Scott: So why did you even just cancel your appointment?

126
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,279
Rym: Well, I still explained like what happened and I was like, so is there anything you can check?

127
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,199
Rym: Like, she's like, I don't know.

128
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,420
Scott: Why even go at that point?

129
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:55,020
Scott: Like if I call a doctor and by the time of my appointment, there's no more babies, grab my esophagus in my hypochondrias.

130
00:06:55,321 --> 00:06:56,379
Scott: I'm canceling that shit.

131
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:01,840
Rym: No, because you could have a situation where you had a problem that is dormant and could come back.

132
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,920
Rym: Like you could have a, like a, what's the name?

133
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,919
Scott: But if you go when it's dormant, the doctor's like, oh, you got to go.

134
00:07:07,421 --> 00:07:10,239
Scott: Like if you've got a rash, you can't go to the doctor when the rash is hiding.

135
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,019
Scott: You got to go and you're covered in hives and shit.

136
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:14,160
Rym: Well, you can go to the doctor when you say I had this rash.

137
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,399
Rym: It came and went for like a while.

138
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:17,240
Scott: It's got to see the rash.

139
00:07:18,343 --> 00:07:21,260
Scott: That's like if you call me to come fix your computer and you're like, man, sounds not working.

140
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:27,039
Scott: I come over, you're playing MP3 and I'm like, I can't really fix the problem because I don't see it.

141
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,858
Rym: Scott, you want to know what the problem is?

142
00:07:29,561 --> 00:07:30,299
Scott: Check closed.

143
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,597
Rym: Do you want to know what the problem is?

144
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,700
Scott: Do you want to know the solution to the problem?

145
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:50,180
Rym: My suggestion to you and based on my experience with our friends who are hypochondriacs and my experience is going to the doctor for nothing is go to the doctor once for vague discomfort in the hypochondriac region.

146
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,140
Scott: I need a regular doctor anyway.

147
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,340
Rym: Let me know who you find because I also need a regular doctor.

148
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,759
Scott: I'm just going to the first person on the list.

149
00:07:59,102 --> 00:08:02,740
Rym: One time I did that and I got a kind of a med doctor in a weird building in Manhattan.

150
00:08:03,762 --> 00:08:06,280
Scott: It does by location so it looks in Astoria where I live.

151
00:08:08,242 --> 00:08:10,680
Scott: And then it sorts them based on the insurance company's rating.

152
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:16,480
Rym: Yeah, I wish I could just pick any doctor because then I'd find an awesome tech doctor.

153
00:08:16,903 --> 00:08:18,020
Scott: Is there an awesome tech doctor?

154
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,239
Rym: I don't know a way to find an awesome tech doctor.

155
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:20,740
Scott: How do you find one?

156
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,559
Rym: Friends, any of you in New York, who is your GP?

157
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:29,359
Rym: I need a rea- Like Dave, Dave, you have to have a doctor in New York and I trust you.

158
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:34,200
Scott: I've been- I went to the awesomest doctor when I first moved here.

159
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:35,100
Scott: It was near my office.

160
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,679
Scott: It was like the best doctor ever.

161
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,100
Rym: You used to talk a lot about that doctor.

162
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:45,700
Scott: And I went to him like once and then I got a letter like a few weeks later like, yep, awesome doctor is now the director of some awesome hospital in Florida.

163
00:08:45,884 --> 00:08:46,458
Scott: See ya.

164
00:08:47,222 --> 00:08:51,640
Scott: I guess I could go to that same office and try to find a doctor in the same office.

165
00:08:52,463 --> 00:08:54,839
Scott: If that office is still there, it was like NYU something something.

166
00:08:55,684 --> 00:08:57,320
Scott: It wasn't near NYU, it was up near my office.

167
00:08:58,481 --> 00:09:01,960
Rym: So in the news, you might've noticed that we didn't put up an episode on Tuesday.

168
00:09:02,403 --> 00:09:03,657
Rym: It's because I fucked up.

169
00:09:04,341 --> 00:09:10,940
Rym: So we have lost a grand total in all the years, 10 years of doing GeekNights, well over a thousand episodes.

170
00:09:11,321 --> 00:09:18,520
Rym: There are five episodes of GeekNights where we sat for an hour and recorded and that is gone.

171
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,779
Scott: You know what's really surprising though?

172
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:26,180
Scott: If you look at like TV, how many TV episodes have been like lost?

173
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:31,100
Scott: I mean, sometimes South Park didn't get their episode in on time, but they never lost one as far as I know.

174
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,980
Scott: They never had like starred over and reanimated everything.

175
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,780
Rym: There's like tons of Doctor Who episodes.

176
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,700
Rym: Like literally no human could ever watch these.

177
00:09:36,901 --> 00:09:37,200
Rym: They're gone.

178
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,079
Scott: No, no, no, but I mean in recent times.

179
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,200
Rym: Oh, oh yeah.

180
00:09:40,361 --> 00:09:42,560
Scott: Like there's no lost Seinfeld or Simpsons.

181
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,560
Scott: Like those people are backing everything up and doing it right somehow.

182
00:09:46,161 --> 00:09:50,220
Scott: So whatever they're doing to never ever fuck up, we should also do to never ever fuck up.

183
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:56,278
Rym: So the problem was complacency because you know, we way back, like we had to fuck up like we lost an episode and I was like, oh, okay.

184
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:05,198
Rym: Cause you cannot do an hour of like conversation and then replicate that immediately after just having done it.

185
00:10:06,321 --> 00:10:08,680
Scott: Like if your show was scripted, it's like, well, okay.

186
00:10:08,982 --> 00:10:10,679
Scott: Like John Stewart has to do daily show again.

187
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:11,704
Scott: He can.

188
00:10:12,309 --> 00:10:13,580
Rym: or like we watched that John Hodgman thing.

189
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,319
Rym: They did the same bit like 15 fucking times.

190
00:10:16,631 --> 00:10:16,800
Rym: Yeah.

191
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,997
Rym: We just had to sit there and watch it.

192
00:10:18,641 --> 00:10:21,820
Rym: But uh, so way back then I was like, we're never fucking this up again.

193
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:28,679
Rym: I bought like the $600 Marantz and I like set up this whole side stream and it saved us like three or four times.

194
00:10:29,402 --> 00:10:31,638
Rym: And then it didn't happen again for a long, long, long, long time.

195
00:10:32,201 --> 00:10:37,800
Scott: Every few months or so I'd look at the Marantz and if it wasn't on, I'd be like, hey Rym, why isn't that backup Marantz on?

196
00:10:37,902 --> 00:10:38,739
Scott: Why aren't you backing up?

197
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:39,614
Rym: And I'd be like, oh shit.

198
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,860
Scott: What if it fucks up right now?

199
00:10:40,921 --> 00:10:41,680
Rym: And I'd be like, oh shit.

200
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,360
Rym: And I'd turn it on.

201
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,658
Scott: No, sometimes you turn it on and sometimes you do not turn it on.

202
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,240
Rym: Back then I'd be like, oh shit.

203
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:47,878
Rym: And I'd turn it on.

204
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,660
Rym: But as more time when I'd say, eh, it'll be fine.

205
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:52,619
Scott: And I'd be like, really?

206
00:10:52,982 --> 00:10:54,079
Scott: Well, it's going to fuck up.

207
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,179
Scott: Maybe you should turn it on.

208
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:01,740
Rym: So this has, it's been years, like years since we've had a problem because one software got better.

209
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:10,520
Rym: Like nowadays, like if my computer crashes or the power goes out, these files are on the hard drive on my computer already.

210
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,520
Rym: Like they're, they can't be lost by those kinds of things.

211
00:11:13,601 --> 00:11:14,380
Scott: You're not using ReSound.

212
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:15,720
Rym: Oh my God.

213
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:16,300
Rym: Those days.

214
00:11:18,142 --> 00:11:25,220
Rym: I should do a show and talk about if I ever need to do a show, like without you, like we'd like you're out of town or something.

215
00:11:25,661 --> 00:11:29,900
Rym: I'll just explain what our pipeline was in like the seven different eras of GeekNights.

216
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:30,731
Scott: Seven eras.

217
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:36,118
Rym: Cause there was a pipeline that involved me sitting for like three fucking hours, editing a show by hand.

218
00:11:37,081 --> 00:11:41,359
Rym: Anyway, so it has not happened in a long, long, long, long, long, long time.

219
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:50,720
Rym: And on Tuesday when we recorded the show, not only did it fuck up, but it fucked up in a way that I had never even imagined possible.

220
00:11:51,842 --> 00:11:54,500
Rym: So we do the show and I monitor the show.

221
00:11:54,580 --> 00:12:01,120
Rym: Like I look at the mixer, I see all the levels, like while I'm talking the whole time, both on the mixer and an audition.

222
00:12:01,662 --> 00:12:06,280
Rym: And I see the wave form is being written, which pretty much meant everything's fine.

223
00:12:06,383 --> 00:12:07,040
Rym: It's not clipping.

224
00:12:07,221 --> 00:12:08,260
Rym: I see things being written.

225
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,319
Rym: Those are on my hard disk.

226
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,700
Rym: So we finished the show and it's a really, really good show.

227
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,780
Rym: I think like I was a really good GeekNights.

228
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:15,336
Rym: Okay.

229
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,851
Rym: And then you think everything is few out.

230
00:12:17,911 --> 00:12:19,340
Rym: now we've had some shit episodes.

231
00:12:20,182 --> 00:12:22,140
Rym: So then a few hours go by and I'm ready to go to bed.

232
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:22,554
Scott: Like this one.

233
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:26,800
Rym: Oh, so I go to like do the edit of the show.

234
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:27,960
Rym: Like I cut a couple of things.

235
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,398
Scott: Should I not say, Oh, is that too morning radio show guy?

236
00:12:31,608 --> 00:12:32,420
Rym: Hey, no.

237
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,800
Rym: Cause I think it's, I think it's ironic at this point.

238
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:35,145
Scott: Okay.

239
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:37,706
Scott: Sometimes it just comes out.

240
00:12:40,962 --> 00:12:45,837
Rym: So, you know, this is as a side, when I got GeekNights back up on iTunes, I was reading those old reviews of us.

241
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,760
Rym: Multiple people said the same thing.

242
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,397
Rym: Different ways.

243
00:12:49,924 --> 00:12:50,478
Scott: What did they say?

244
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,420
Scott: Their complaint was the same person writing a bunch of different reviews.

245
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,760
Rym: These reviews are actually like one, like two are on iTunes.

246
00:12:55,981 --> 00:12:56,900
Rym: One was somewhere else.

247
00:12:57,002 --> 00:12:57,960
Rym: They were very different.

248
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:04,901
Rym: Their complaint was we sound too professional and we sound like people on the radio and like.

249
00:13:05,283 --> 00:13:10,280
Rym: we're too high energy and loud and always talking and there's no pauses or breaks.

250
00:13:10,661 --> 00:13:11,758
Rym: And it sounds too fake.

251
00:13:12,021 --> 00:13:16,200
Scott: Well, cause we don't have music or ads to break it up.

252
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,399
Scott: It's too, what do you want?

253
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,420
Rym: Their complaint was we needed to sound more like awkward nerds.

254
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,520
Scott: It sounded like you want us to sound like NPR was quiet.

255
00:13:24,901 --> 00:13:28,799
Rym: And then on GeekNights, we're going to be talking about some things that have happened.

256
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,317
Rym: But first Scott, Scott's got a story for you.

257
00:13:31,981 --> 00:13:38,364
Rym: Gonna pause in between Rym story, my story and play a little like some slow jam to like, so, uh, yeah.

258
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:45,940
Rym: So anyway, I hit play and I'm listening to the show, just like check a couple of things.

259
00:13:46,343 --> 00:13:48,020
Rym: And I hear like the intro play and everything.

260
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,177
Rym: And then I hear robots yelling at me.

261
00:13:51,303 --> 00:13:52,240
Rym: What the fuck?

262
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,180
Scott: I am the pusher robot.

263
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:53,456
Rym: Yeah.

264
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,899
Rym: So I like, so long story short, I will push you down the stairs.

265
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:57,818
Rym: I'd look her.

266
00:13:58,127 --> 00:13:58,438
Rym: I do.

267
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,320
Rym: I like, I can't like, it's a weird problem.

268
00:14:00,481 --> 00:14:06,120
Rym: And I like my filters and we had just upgraded from the terrible secret of space.

269
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:11,399
Rym: So I w I thought that maybe like my template for GeekNights got messed up in the upgrade or something.

270
00:14:11,721 --> 00:14:17,297
Rym: So I check all the effects racks and eventually I turn off all the effects as the problem is still there.

271
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:30,019
Rym: So then I opened the raw wave file and I zoom in and then I see, I'm not going to go into detail beyond this, but I will link to an analysis of what happened, but she went down in the wave file.

272
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,879
Rym: And thanks to our good friend, Tracy, who helped me.

273
00:14:34,101 --> 00:14:34,640
Rym: It's a good thing.

274
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,940
Scott: We know so many experts at various things.

275
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:41,160
Rym: Yes, because I'm an expert at audio, but I'm not a great developer.

276
00:14:41,701 --> 00:14:44,179
Rym: I also have not written Python code in a long time.

277
00:14:45,021 --> 00:15:02,520
Rym: And me fucking around with the wave library and Python is not the most efficient thing in the world, but, uh, Tracy helped me out and removed the repeated segments of 71 null samples that were occurring every like 800 ish samples in the files.

278
00:15:03,382 --> 00:15:14,039
Rym: And I had to do a bunch of more work, but the last episode of GeekNights from Tuesday will have some audio issues, but will be intelligible and listenable and is going to be up probably this weekend.

279
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:22,940
Scott: Probably put a non horrible disclaimer in the front, like just so you know, this episode might sound really painful to your ears.

280
00:15:23,061 --> 00:15:24,197
Scott: If it does, just stop it.

281
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,899
Scott: Don't listen to it.

282
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:33,179
Rym: Because we don't want to turn people off because this is the episode where we talk about Wil Wheaton being kind of an asshole at length.

283
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:42,820
Rym: So I suspect, much like how the Go community found our Go is a bad game video recently, I suspect the Wil Wheaton community might find that episode of GeekNights.

284
00:15:43,281 --> 00:15:49,700
Scott: And we're just saying mostly the same stuff as everyone else, but then adding in the extra stuff about no one knowing how to read board game rules.

285
00:15:49,861 --> 00:15:50,360
Rym: Yep, exactly.

286
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,999
Rym: That part, I think, is going to anger more people.

287
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:52,620
Scott: Maybe.

288
00:15:54,624 --> 00:15:56,099
Rym: Maybe the guy who wrote Hellas will talk to us.

289
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:56,573
Rym: No.

290
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,320
Rym: So you got some news?

291
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,260
Scott: Yes, I do have some news.

292
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:08,880
Scott: So obviously, you know, something we've known for a long time is that if you put out a Confederate flag in a sincere fashion, you're a bad person.

293
00:16:09,383 --> 00:16:10,140
Rym: Pretty much straight up.

294
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,400
Scott: And the Confederate flag symbolizes racism and wanting slaves.

295
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,899
Rym: There is no debate about that.

296
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,700
Scott: Also, people don't know history.

297
00:16:19,841 --> 00:16:22,140
Scott: They think the Confederate flag is the flag of the Confederacy.

298
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:22,639
Scott: It's not.

299
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,199
Scott: It's the flag of General Lee.

300
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,400
Scott: The actual Confederate flag looked a lot more like an American flag.

301
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:34,915
Rym: Well, like people like to this day, a lot of people think that the Confederate government used the Articles of Confederation because there's no.

302
00:16:35,135 --> 00:16:37,520
Scott: that was something that happened before he made the Constitution.

303
00:16:38,284 --> 00:16:40,059
Scott: And we were like, oops, that didn't work.

304
00:16:40,261 --> 00:16:40,366
Scott: Yeah.

305
00:16:40,881 --> 00:16:42,139
Scott: Let's make the Constitution.

306
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:46,176
Scott: And the Confederacy was like, you know, we kind of like the shitty.

307
00:16:46,196 --> 00:16:48,840
Scott: way better than that was already proven not to work.

308
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,507
Scott: Similar to that.

309
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,200
Rym: No, what the Confederacy actually did.

310
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,440
Rym: You don't even know the full story here.

311
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,739
Rym: What they actually did.

312
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:55,663
Rym: And it's so.

313
00:16:56,084 --> 00:17:01,840
Rym: it would be funny if it wasn't so sad and so tied to one of the most tragic chapters in American history.

314
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,540
Scott: Every chapter of American history is tragic.

315
00:17:04,761 --> 00:17:05,438
Rym: We got some good ones.

316
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,659
Rym: OK, we got some good things happen a couple of times.

317
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:13,184
Scott: So even when we were going to the moon, people were aiming nukes at us, but they didn't launch them.

318
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:14,818
Rym: We didn't launch them.

319
00:17:16,181 --> 00:17:19,500
Rym: So the Confederacy took the real U.S.

320
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:29,120
Rym: Constitution, copied it with some errors, like copied the whole thing, changed a couple of bullshitty things that didn't matter for no reason just to be different.

321
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:36,360
Rym: So like instead of a president that have two terms of four years, you can your president is six years, but they can only have one term.

322
00:17:38,005 --> 00:17:41,160
Rym: And then they added and slavery to fucking everything.

323
00:17:41,822 --> 00:17:46,740
Rym: They just added all these clauses saying slavery is a God given right.

324
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,280
Rym: Slavery is like an unalienable right.

325
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,419
Rym: Slavery cannot be removed from this from any state.

326
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,320
Rym: Slavery, slavery, slavery, slavery, slavery.

327
00:17:54,540 --> 00:18:04,480
Scott: So all those people who are really don't know history, including one of my history professors at RIT who taught the you have to take this class senior year just to make a requirement.

328
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:12,940
Scott: It's mostly a freshman high school history class who say things like, oh, yes, the Civil War was actually about state rights, economic something.

329
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,519
Rym: John Green said it best.

330
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,040
Rym: A state's right to what slavery?

331
00:18:19,144 --> 00:18:22,020
Rym: Oh, there's one other thing they changed, which is extra hilarious.

332
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:34,700
Rym: They added a whole section that basically says you cannot use tax dollars on the federal level or from any one state to help another state with anything.

333
00:18:34,761 --> 00:18:35,334
Scott: We could use that.

334
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:36,699
Scott: I'm down with that rule.

335
00:18:37,262 --> 00:18:37,875
Rym: So bring it.

336
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:38,999
Scott: Bring that rule.

337
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:39,433
Scott: Yeah.

338
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,060
Rym: See what happens, Texas.

339
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:42,939
Scott: Let's see what happens in Nebraska.

340
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:43,920
Scott: How are you doing, Nebraska?

341
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,835
Rym: Actually, Texas is pretty much the only red state.

342
00:18:46,855 --> 00:18:47,399
Rym: that would be OK.

343
00:18:47,922 --> 00:18:49,200
Scott: I'm just saying Nebraska.

344
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,118
Rym: Nebraska not looking so hot like that.

345
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:51,900
Rym: Mississippi.

346
00:18:53,522 --> 00:18:54,580
Scott: What you doing down there?

347
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,398
Scott: You make anything?

348
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:57,779
Scott: You got Econ going on.

349
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:58,644
Rym: But yeah, we're.

350
00:18:58,745 --> 00:19:00,480
Rym: I mean, we could do a whole show on this stuff.

351
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,139
Scott: Is there even a business in Mississippi?

352
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,720
Scott: But it's not like a liquor store.

353
00:19:05,181 --> 00:19:07,360
Rym: Mississippi is probably the worst state in the union.

354
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:08,157
Scott: Maybe.

355
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,039
Rym: But anyway, don't worry.

356
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,139
Rym: I don't want to get into all this.

357
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,273
Rym: Like we could do a whole hour.

358
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:22,400
Scott: The actual news is that Apple and many other businesses have decided to get rid of and states do finally are getting rid of Confederate flags, which is good.

359
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,600
Rym: Yeah, it's a. it's a great thing in my opinion.

360
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:28,580
Scott: Well, I mean, I guess it's still OK to watch Dukes of Hazzard, but it's not that great show anyway.

361
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,460
Rym: I don't know why you would, but it was kind of like Robin Hood with cars.

362
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,457
Rym: I liked it as a kid.

363
00:19:32,863 --> 00:19:33,780
Scott: Yeah, maybe whatever.

364
00:19:33,941 --> 00:19:37,820
Scott: But anyway, Apple went all out and was like, you know what?

365
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,552
Scott: We're just anything with the Confederate flag in.

366
00:19:39,572 --> 00:19:40,720
Scott: it is banned from the app store.

367
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:44,080
Scott: They just removed every single app that had that image in it anywhere.

368
00:19:44,182 --> 00:19:45,000
Scott: And it's like, wait a minute.

369
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:53,120
Rym: Now, that would be fine if it weren't for the fact that most of the apps that have that image in it are civil war, like war simulation.

370
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:59,040
Scott: I mean, I'm sure that somewhere it's being used racistly in the app store, but you didn't even take the time to actually look at each app.

371
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,720
Scott: And it's like, dude, that's just like grog nard war game in there.

372
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,168
Scott: I mean, what if the board game store?

373
00:20:04,188 --> 00:20:14,300
Scott: I mean, if I was at the board game store and they had a game that was like, you know, keep slaves on purpose and had Confederate flags on it and be like, yeah, listen, I'm not putting that game on my shelf.

374
00:20:14,401 --> 00:20:15,039
Scott: I'm a game store.

375
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:20,280
Rym: But if it's north and south, the Battle of Gettysburg or north and south, the NES game.

376
00:20:21,022 --> 00:20:23,697
Scott: It's like, well, yeah, I mean, you play Wolfenstein 3D.

377
00:20:24,543 --> 00:20:26,680
Scott: It has Nazi swastikas in it.

378
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,564
Rym: And I know there's.

379
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:30,839
Scott: that's different from kill all the Jews the game.

380
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,298
Scott: Which has Nazi swastikas in it.

381
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,760
Scott: Now you have to, you know, use your judgment.

382
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,560
Scott: And instead of, you know, I know a lot of you always cry censorship when it's not.

383
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,940
Scott: And this isn't because it's Apple, but it's still stupid.

384
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:53,040
Scott: So Apple completely, it's like if you have a forum and you're trying to ban bad people from the forum and you end up banning perfectly good people from the forum.

385
00:20:53,121 --> 00:20:54,019
Scott: It's like, why did you do that?

386
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:54,355
Rym: Yep.

387
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,620
Rym: Now here's the problem.

388
00:20:56,142 --> 00:20:58,300
Rym: So there's a bunch of updates to the story.

389
00:20:58,561 --> 00:21:04,980
Rym: Apple just pulled literally everything that has any image of the Confederate flag, which is a completely stupid thing to have done.

390
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:05,396
Scott: Pretty dumb.

391
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,200
Rym: But the update I see here is quote, this is from the Touch Arcade article.

392
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:15,780
Rym: We have an official update from an official Apple statement regarding the removal of games.

393
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,900
Scott: If you reapply, they'll actually take a look.

394
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:25,760
Rym: Specifically, Apple states that we have removed apps from the app store that use the Confederate flag in offensive or mean spirited ways, which is a violation of our guidelines.

395
00:21:26,183 --> 00:21:28,099
Rym: Now, obviously I'm just me again.

396
00:21:28,601 --> 00:21:32,599
Rym: That's bullshit because they removed games like ultimate general Gettysburg.

397
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:37,700
Scott: Which is not offensive in any way unless you really hate any war games.

398
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,540
Rym: I mean, if you hate war.

399
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:43,820
Scott: I'm sure it's offensive to someone, maybe someone who is actually Confederate and thought the Confederate would win.

400
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,220
Scott: They're upset that they lost.

401
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,719
Scott: They don't want to be reminded that the North is going to kick their ass.

402
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,719
Rym: So sources, this is not an official thing.

403
00:21:53,121 --> 00:22:03,948
Rym: Close to Apple say that actually they're working to find all the apps that are good and bring them back in, but they're still going to require the developers to remove or replace the Confederate flag.

404
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,460
Rym: So Apple is still full of bullshit.

405
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,319
Scott: Why would you remove the Confederate flag from a civil war?

406
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:12,020
Scott: Serious war simulation, turn based strategy game.

407
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,939
Rym: I think, uh, Maxims, how do I know?

408
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,618
Scott: How do I know what the other team is?

409
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,940
Rym: One of the developers of one of these games said it best.

410
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,429
Rym: I'm quoting Maxims as off Spielberg.

411
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:25,018
Rym: Schindler's list did not try to amend his movie to look more comfortable.

412
00:22:26,662 --> 00:22:28,899
Rym: So Apple, like, fuck you.

413
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,339
Rym: What else can I say?

414
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,860
Rym: This is, there is no way to spin this in the right way.

415
00:22:34,203 --> 00:22:35,980
Rym: And it looks like you're literally going.

416
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:46,080
Scott: They're really just being lazy and not taking the time to, it's like, they'll take the time to look at your app to make sure it's not malware, but you won't take the time to look at all these apps to make sure they're not offensive.

417
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:51,300
Scott: And if you were, if this was part of your policy, why didn't you enforce it when these apps are first submitted?

418
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:55,580
Scott: I guess you didn't have a problem with the Confederate flag yesterday, but you do today.

419
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:03,240
Rym: Are you, what if I have an app of historical political atlases through history?

420
00:23:03,765 --> 00:23:04,060
Scott: Sure.

421
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,960
Scott: And also, what if my app is flag search?

422
00:23:08,121 --> 00:23:10,498
Scott: You take a picture of flag and then I tell you what flag it is.

423
00:23:11,621 --> 00:23:14,880
Rym: What if my app has the Rhodesian flag in it?

424
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,697
Rym: Are you gonna let that in?

425
00:23:16,482 --> 00:23:17,778
Rym: Yeah, I'll bet you will.

426
00:23:19,122 --> 00:23:19,739
Rym: Rhodesian is funny.

427
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,040
Scott: What if I have the Eritrean flag in there?

428
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:22,840
Rym: Well, it's not funny.

429
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:31,992
Rym: It's actually sad, but the Rhodesian flag is pretty much like, like if you said it was to see some of the Confederate flag, they're like your run of the mill racist or just a moron.

430
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:32,440
Scott: Yep.

431
00:23:32,781 --> 00:23:36,600
Rym: But if they've got the Rhodesian flag out, that's like inside baseball racism.

432
00:23:36,701 --> 00:23:38,520
Rym: That's like racism as a hobby.

433
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:42,600
Scott: Well, I mean, Eritrea is basically North Korea only in Africa.

434
00:23:42,941 --> 00:23:44,900
Scott: What if I have a North Korean flag and I'm waving it?

435
00:23:45,292 --> 00:23:45,540
Rym: Yeah.

436
00:23:46,221 --> 00:23:48,020
Rym: What about, I mean, the Soviet flag?

437
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,040
Scott: I mean, it's basically worse than slavery in North Korea right now.

438
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,479
Scott: They just have people in fucking camps.

439
00:23:53,820 --> 00:24:01,219
Rym: Now, I'm super glad that the rebel traitor flag is finally getting the disrespect it deserves across the United States.

440
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,320
Rym: That is great.

441
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:06,240
Rym: But seriously, Apple, like this is almost pathetic.

442
00:24:06,961 --> 00:24:09,000
Rym: Is this what happens when you don't have Steve Jobs anymore?

443
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,020
Rym: Like rapidly making poor decisions?

444
00:24:11,806 --> 00:24:12,097
Scott: I don't know.

445
00:24:17,975 --> 00:24:19,950
Rym: And now things of the day.

446
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:25,429
Rym: Scott gave me crap for being too cautious in between that little bit when I stopped to go back and make sure the show sounded good.

447
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:26,319
Rym: Yeah.

448
00:24:27,177 --> 00:24:27,950
Scott: We got the Marantz back.

449
00:24:28,973 --> 00:24:30,989
Rym: My audio hypochondrias is acting up.

450
00:24:31,474 --> 00:24:32,289
Scott: It sure is.

451
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:37,589
Rym: So my thing of the day yesterday was, well, two days ago that'll be up this weekend was amazing.

452
00:24:38,773 --> 00:24:40,190
Rym: So I got a crappy thing of the day.

453
00:24:40,311 --> 00:24:40,789
Rym: It's not crappy.

454
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:41,670
Rym: It's just it's sad.

455
00:24:42,372 --> 00:24:54,086
Rym: If you live in a city that is small or nice or normal and not a like giant global city of the world, your city might do things like movie nights and little fairs and food things that are free.

456
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:59,669
Scott: And if they do, the worst part will be parking because there's probably not enough parking and everyone has cars there.

457
00:24:59,872 --> 00:25:01,570
Scott: So you'll probably have like a parking garage.

458
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:02,590
Scott: They got to pay money to get in.

459
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:11,049
Rym: Like in Providence, there's water fire night where they just like light all these giant braziers on the river and you just like walk along the water and there's music and food and it's great.

460
00:25:12,151 --> 00:25:19,370
Rym: In a place like New York, if something is free, you should avoid that area as though Ebola has broken out there.

461
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:22,710
Scott: Unless it's something you really fucking want, in which case get there early.

462
00:25:23,051 --> 00:25:24,329
Rym: Or it's something so niche.

463
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:27,370
Rym: Like it's sad to say hockey is like that.

464
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:34,730
Rym: When we saw the hockey games live, it was not a problem, even though it was free, because as much as hockey is great, not that many people care about hockey.

465
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:45,630
Rym: But this is a video for I apologize for the verticalness of it, but from the roof of a building in Bryant Park, Bryant Park is one of the best tiny parks in New York City.

466
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:46,249
Scott: Pretty much.

467
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:54,349
Scott: It's this big field of grass behind the library and you know, the library from Ghostbusters and underneath the grass is where they keep all the books.

468
00:25:54,971 --> 00:26:02,810
Scott: So on top of that, because you can't really put a building foundation there because there's book storage, there's just a park on top of the library.

469
00:26:02,931 --> 00:26:04,330
Rym: I would eat lunch there like every day.

470
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,810
Rym: It's just such a nice part.

471
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:07,110
Scott: So it's just a big field of grass.

472
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,249
Scott: Sometimes you can go on the grass.

473
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:09,849
Scott: Sometimes you can't go in the grass.

474
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:14,390
Rym: In fact, there's a wonderful day every year because the grass is closed until like a certain day in spring.

475
00:26:15,391 --> 00:26:22,529
Rym: And on that day, a bunch of schools bring a bunch of kids to the park and the kids all stand around the edge of the grass.

476
00:26:23,171 --> 00:26:27,950
Rym: And then they announce the field is now officially open and there's mad.

477
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,070
Scott: The grass is so nice.

478
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:40,105
Rym: You like it's the highest quality grass to watch the most delightful scene of hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of like little kids run out onto this grass and do what kids do for like 20 minutes.

479
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:42,390
Scott: And around the edge of the grass is all sorts of park shit.

480
00:26:42,692 --> 00:26:43,870
Scott: Chairs and restaurants.

481
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:44,709
Rym: Ping pong tables.

482
00:26:45,291 --> 00:26:47,950
Rym: Also the nicest public bathrooms in all of New York City.

483
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:48,364
Scott: Oh yeah.

484
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:49,507
Rym: You need to pee.

485
00:26:50,533 --> 00:26:51,590
Scott: Behind the library.

486
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:52,709
Rym: So they do.

487
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:56,170
Rym: There is a free movie night in Bryan Park in the summer.

488
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:57,749
Rym: It's kind of a long standing thing.

489
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:02,361
Rym: This is a video of what it looks like at 4 p.m.

490
00:27:02,863 --> 00:27:05,430
Rym: when they let people walk onto the grass.

491
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:10,553
Scott: 4 p.m The sun doesn't go down this time of year until about 830.

492
00:27:10,553 --> 00:27:11,070
Scott: When's the movie?

493
00:27:11,853 --> 00:27:12,388
Rym: After dark.

494
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,970
Scott: The sundown is at 830.

495
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:16,289
Scott: Sunset.

496
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:32,189
Rym: This video, the most amazing thing about it is that when they start running, it is less than 15 seconds until this motherfucker has a blanket so big you can see it from the sky filling literally the best possible spot.

497
00:27:33,336 --> 00:27:33,889
Scott: That guy's pro.

498
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,470
Rym: Yeah, that guy is pro.

499
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,249
Rym: Someone interviewed that guy actually.

500
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:41,270
Scott: Anything like this, like free concerts in Central Park.

501
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:42,790
Scott: I'll be biking through the park.

502
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:44,269
Scott: I'll see a huge line of people.

503
00:27:45,753 --> 00:27:47,170
Rym: The Japanese Culture Festival?

504
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:50,170
Rym: Stand in line for an hour to get one free Odongo.

505
00:27:51,412 --> 00:27:53,210
Scott: They got that right now.

506
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:55,130
Scott: There's a recreation of Seinfeld's apartment.

507
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:55,869
Scott: I think near Union Square.

508
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:56,589
Rym: Someone already broke it.

509
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:57,130
Scott: I know.

510
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:57,608
Scott: I saw that.

511
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:58,650
Scott: Union Square.

512
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:03,890
Scott: That guy who broke it I think waited in line an hour to go in there and Kramer the door just once.

513
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:05,109
Rym: You know when I'm gonna see that thing?

514
00:28:05,473 --> 00:28:07,350
Rym: Seven years from now, I don't think it'll be there.

515
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:09,429
Scott: I'm not.

516
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:10,689
Scott: Why should I need to go see it?

517
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:11,186
Scott: Is it really?

518
00:28:11,931 --> 00:28:12,807
Rym: There's the problem, though.

519
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:17,370
Scott: Do I need to get a Georgia sexy picture taken on one?

520
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:18,610
Rym: So here's the problem.

521
00:28:19,272 --> 00:28:20,048
Rym: Things like that.

522
00:28:20,592 --> 00:28:24,087
Rym: If I could just be like, oh, hey, like I'm in the neighborhood, like walk up, see it and walk out.

523
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:24,867
Rym: I would totally do.

524
00:28:25,138 --> 00:28:25,329
Rym: Sure.

525
00:28:25,511 --> 00:28:26,590
Rym: Those are idle amusements.

526
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:28,309
Rym: That would be totally cool in New York.

527
00:28:28,811 --> 00:28:31,189
Rym: Those are things that you have to wait four hours to see.

528
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:33,870
Scott: I mean, there are, you know, things vary in popularity, right?

529
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:40,587
Scott: For example, during like the World Series, they'll set up like the Major League Baseball hangout place.

530
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:41,206
Rym: Yeah.

531
00:28:41,371 --> 00:28:43,169
Scott: And it's like you could just fucking walk in there.

532
00:28:43,433 --> 00:28:44,470
Scott: It's not really a problem.

533
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:48,839
Scott: There might be a crowded time or two, but for the most part, you can just walk right in.

534
00:28:49,211 --> 00:28:52,249
Scott: You know, those Hatsune Miku Expo, you can just walk right into that.

535
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:52,417
Scott: Yeah.

536
00:28:52,711 --> 00:28:53,870
Rym: Unless you went right when it opened.

537
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:55,488
Scott: It'll be crowded, but you can just get in.

538
00:28:55,735 --> 00:28:55,926
Scott: Yeah.

539
00:28:56,150 --> 00:29:04,730
Rym: There won't be a line down the street, but anything that is popular and free or anything that is a sit down for a long time event without assigned seating.

540
00:29:05,933 --> 00:29:07,129
Rym: Or anything that has free food.

541
00:29:08,555 --> 00:29:09,390
Rym: Never go for free food.

542
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:10,888
Rym: That's probably the worst thing you can ever go for.

543
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:11,290
Rym: Yeah.

544
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:14,190
Rym: But yeah, this video is horrifying and amazing.

545
00:29:17,095 --> 00:29:17,748
Rym: You got to think of the day.

546
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:19,430
Scott: Oh, think of the day.

547
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:24,190
Scott: So in Brazil, this guy parked in a handicapped spot because he's a jerk.

548
00:29:24,911 --> 00:29:31,089
Scott: And I guess they knew that he wasn't handicapped, you know, because, A, his car didn't have the thing that says you're allowed to park there.

549
00:29:31,272 --> 00:29:31,508
Scott: Yup.

550
00:29:31,631 --> 00:29:33,349
Scott: B, they think they saw him get out of the car.

551
00:29:33,771 --> 00:29:36,250
Scott: And C, I think he's a repeat offender.

552
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:42,110
Scott: So a whole mob of people decided to revenge on him for his bad.

553
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:42,539
Rym: Yeah.

554
00:29:42,852 --> 00:29:43,410
Rym: Mob justice.

555
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:44,629
Scott: To teach him a lesson.

556
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:45,729
Scott: Why?

557
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:48,310
Scott: Why would I say lesson in a French way in Brazil?

558
00:29:48,811 --> 00:29:51,009
Rym: How do you even know what a Portuguese accent sounds like?

559
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:51,839
Rym: No.

560
00:29:52,456 --> 00:29:52,627
Rym: Okay.

561
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:54,789
Scott: I definitely can't imitate one.

562
00:29:55,571 --> 00:30:00,753
Scott: I might be able to pick one out of someone talking, but I definitely cannot even come close to.

563
00:30:00,793 --> 00:30:04,350
Rym: the proof that this guy is not handicapped is his reaction.

564
00:30:04,551 --> 00:30:04,807
Rym: I think.

565
00:30:05,051 --> 00:30:06,470
Scott: Yeah, he is so angry.

566
00:30:07,019 --> 00:30:07,449
Scott: It is great.

567
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:10,730
Scott: Watch him and feel there is justice in the world somewhere.

568
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:13,830
Rym: The best part is the crowd cheering the whole time.

569
00:30:14,198 --> 00:30:14,365
Scott: Yeah.

570
00:30:14,952 --> 00:30:17,990
Rym: And the fact that there's so many of them that he cannot easily get away.

571
00:30:18,676 --> 00:30:19,250
Rym: It's beautiful.

572
00:30:20,253 --> 00:30:22,049
Rym: In a moment, the booklet book is the wheel of time.

573
00:30:22,392 --> 00:30:23,350
Scott: I read some more yesterday.

574
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:27,170
Scott: I got to the, uh, the not dragon thing flying down.

575
00:30:27,612 --> 00:30:30,850
Rym: Oh, so they're getting, they're almost at, uh, whatever ferry, like the town.

576
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:31,609
Scott: Oh, they got to the ferry.

577
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:33,369
Scott: They're, they, they, they're messing with the ferry guy.

578
00:30:33,812 --> 00:30:35,588
Rym: Oh, the first time or the second time?

579
00:30:36,573 --> 00:30:38,310
Scott: Uh, we only knocked on the ferry guy's door.

580
00:30:38,531 --> 00:30:38,809
Rym: Okay.

581
00:30:39,251 --> 00:30:40,370
Rym: Let me know if you get to the point.

582
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,610
Scott: Hey, ferry guy, we have gold.

583
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:42,769
Scott: Make a ferry move.

584
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:46,199
Scott: The moment when the ferry guy gets fucked is when I, is when I got it.

585
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:50,208
Rym: Like that's me.

586
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:50,990
Rym: That's where I am right now.

587
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:51,750
Scott: He's going to steal his ferry.

588
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:52,449
Scott: He gets fucked.

589
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:53,669
Scott: I'm pretty sure he does.

590
00:30:53,951 --> 00:30:54,609
Rym: He deserves it too.

591
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:55,270
Rym: I think probably.

592
00:30:55,371 --> 00:30:55,969
Scott: He doesn't seem nice.

593
00:30:56,191 --> 00:30:56,606
Rym: No, he doesn't.

594
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:56,941
Rym: Yeah.

595
00:30:57,715 --> 00:30:59,870
Scott: But I just get an Oregon trail feeling from this ferry.

596
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:02,989
Scott: I hope it's not a shadow gay feeling from the ferry.

597
00:31:04,936 --> 00:31:05,690
Rym: It's not game of thrones.

598
00:31:05,932 --> 00:31:06,509
Rym: I think you're okay there.

599
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:07,429
Scott: Castlevania ferry.

600
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:14,370
Rym: I uploaded a ton of videos and I'm going to upload more this weekend after I fix our fucked episode from Tuesday.

601
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:15,487
Rym: I have video.

602
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:16,689
Scott: It's going to rain all weekend.

603
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,970
Scott: We're going to get shit done, but mostly I'm going to clean my apartment.

604
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:19,450
Rym: Yup.

605
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:27,830
Rym: I'm going to spend one day doing sports and one day maybe trying to make a video version of Wil Wheaton's tabletop ourselves for a two player game.

606
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:31,530
Scott: I'm going to spend cleaning my apartment and doing laundry and then we'll see how much time is left.

607
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:36,829
Rym: I just bought a for real brand new studio light to augment all our other lights to like make this happen.

608
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:37,910
Scott: A light bulb.

609
00:31:38,572 --> 00:31:41,509
Rym: I bought a many hundred dollar light bulb.

610
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:42,233
Scott: Wow.

611
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:45,629
Scott: Good choice of money spending by you.

612
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:46,186
Rym: Yeah.

613
00:31:46,251 --> 00:31:46,747
Rym: Well, you know what?

614
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:53,229
Rym: We're the kinds of people who get excited about things like lights and furniture, which is proof that we are adults.

615
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:55,069
Scott: I'm not excited about furniture really.

616
00:31:55,311 --> 00:31:58,950
Rym: I am, except I can't even afford the kind of furniture I want.

617
00:32:00,436 --> 00:32:01,270
Rym: So yeah, I guess furniture.

618
00:32:02,774 --> 00:32:06,090
Scott: We came up with this show idea because we're literally out of show ideas.

619
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:08,669
Rym: I had some other ideas, but Scott did not like them.

620
00:32:08,751 --> 00:32:09,409
Rym: So we went with this.

621
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:09,969
Rym: Like what?

622
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:11,288
Rym: Let me look at the chat.

623
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:12,950
Scott: Let's just talk about furniture instead.

624
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:13,470
Rym: Okay.

625
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:16,470
Scott: So you have furniture in your house.

626
00:32:16,591 --> 00:32:18,110
Scott: You need it to be comfortable.

627
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:20,249
Rym: Here's the phases of furniture in your life.

628
00:32:20,852 --> 00:32:25,649
Rym: You have whatever furniture your parents had and there's always like the couch you're allowed to sit on or something.

629
00:32:29,031 --> 00:32:33,950
Rym: Then you go to college and there's only two options for, well, three options for college.

630
00:32:34,312 --> 00:32:36,670
Rym: Your parents are rich and they buy you a bunch of furniture.

631
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:39,310
Scott: You take the old furniture from your parents' house.

632
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,930
Rym: That they wanted to get rid of for their entire lives.

633
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:42,929
Scott: And they buy new stuff.

634
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:43,398
Rym: Yup.

635
00:32:44,134 --> 00:32:45,190
Rym: Or you go to college.

636
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:46,369
Scott: So you're still stuck with your parents' furniture.

637
00:32:46,611 --> 00:32:48,730
Rym: Or you go to college without furniture.

638
00:32:49,452 --> 00:32:50,749
Rym: Those are the three options.

639
00:32:51,873 --> 00:32:57,910
Rym: We were kind of lucky in that when we went to RIT, Scott had a bunch of nice furniture, like that big table and everything.

640
00:32:58,130 --> 00:32:58,508
Rym: Remember the table?

641
00:32:58,950 --> 00:32:59,970
Scott: That table wasn't nice.

642
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:01,990
Scott: That was the old kitchen table from my parents' kitchen.

643
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:02,181
Scott: Yeah.

644
00:33:02,411 --> 00:33:04,270
Scott: And then we learned- That they replaced just like we said.

645
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:07,049
Rym: But then we learned how expensive fud tables are.

646
00:33:08,411 --> 00:33:11,570
Scott: But I brought because- That was my childhood kitchen table.

647
00:33:12,672 --> 00:33:17,870
Rym: So my family had a bunch of tons of extra furniture because we had like a living room, family room, like all in a big giant house.

648
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:20,389
Rym: So I brought a couch, a loveseat.

649
00:33:20,853 --> 00:33:21,981
Rym: A giant La-Z-Boy.

650
00:33:22,022 --> 00:33:23,029
Rym: that was also a bed.

651
00:33:23,798 --> 00:33:24,350
Rym: A piano.

652
00:33:24,872 --> 00:33:25,770
Rym: A wine cabinet.

653
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,108
Rym: A bunch of dressers.

654
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:31,810
Rym: So I remember very distinctly this time when we were in Colony.

655
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:32,809
Rym: We lived there for a couple of weeks.

656
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:35,470
Rym: And I was wandering around the neighborhood at night.

657
00:33:35,711 --> 00:33:36,448
Rym: Just wandering around.

658
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:39,127
Rym: Because I was kind of still like, "Oh my God, I'm in college in an

659
00:33:39,147 --> 00:33:39,510
Rym: apartment.".

660
00:33:40,494 --> 00:33:41,869
Rym: And I was looking in people's windows.

661
00:33:43,171 --> 00:33:48,210
Rym: And I saw that most people had either no furniture or cinder block furniture.

662
00:33:49,071 --> 00:33:54,269
Rym: Like a lot of people had lawn chairs at card tables with computers on them.

663
00:33:55,173 --> 00:33:56,929
Rym: And then I saw our apartment through the window.

664
00:33:58,452 --> 00:34:00,230
Scott: We had desks that we bought.

665
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:01,670
Rym: Yeah, we had real desks.

666
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:02,728
Scott: Purchased desks.

667
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:05,890
Rym: We had a piano and a wine cabinet.

668
00:34:06,453 --> 00:34:07,289
Rym: Real couches.

669
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:08,708
Rym: A coffee table.

670
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:12,909
Rym: Like our apartment looked like an actual apartment that humans lived in.

671
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:15,529
Scott: I mean it was still a college apartment very much.

672
00:34:16,071 --> 00:34:17,549
Scott: But we had real furniture in there.

673
00:34:18,033 --> 00:34:20,870
Rym: I really enjoyed that time as a result.

674
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:21,897
Rym: Yup.

675
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:26,129
Rym: And in fact that furniture privilege was...

676
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:30,389
Scott: In fact the bed that I had I bought at a store near RIT.

677
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:32,510
Rym: I remember when you got that bed.

678
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:35,509
Rym: Meanwhile I brought this gigantic fucking queen size bed.

679
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:36,389
Scott: From your parents.

680
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:36,900
Rym: Yup.

681
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,830
Rym: That I still have with the same mattress.

682
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,290
Rym: I'm thinking about replacing the mattress.

683
00:34:41,033 --> 00:34:43,330
Scott: I'm still using the same bed since the first day of college.

684
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:44,330
Rym: It's a really nice bed.

685
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:46,208
Rym: In fact remember when I replaced all the slats?

686
00:34:46,755 --> 00:34:48,270
Rym: I bought those super nice slats.

687
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:49,949
Rym: I spent a lot of money on those slats.

688
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:50,418
Scott: Wood.

689
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:51,550
Scott: Just cost that much money.

690
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:52,228
Rym: Good wood.

691
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:53,047
Scott: Good wood.

692
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:53,827
Rym: But uh...

693
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:54,449
Scott: Rym likes wood.

694
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:55,348
Rym: I'm actually at the point.

695
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:56,629
Rym: The problem is...

696
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:57,469
Scott: Rym pays a lot for wood.

697
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:58,989
Rym: Yeah, I like it.

698
00:34:59,371 --> 00:35:00,550
Rym: I'm much a fan of wood.

699
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:02,250
Scott: Rym will pay a lot of money for good wood.

700
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:04,690
Rym: We have a video of me and Scott at PAX South.

701
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:05,309
Rym: Do you remember this?

702
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:11,210
Rym: Talking to a wood aficionado about the many different colors, sizes, shapes, and grains of wood.

703
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:11,727
Rym: Yes.

704
00:35:12,191 --> 00:35:13,470
Scott: That he used for his dice towers.

705
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,270
Rym: For his dice towers.

706
00:35:15,591 --> 00:35:16,250
Scott: Towers of wood.

707
00:35:16,353 --> 00:35:16,950
Scott: Wood towers.

708
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:17,908
Rym: Tower wood.

709
00:35:18,411 --> 00:35:19,709
Scott: That he threw stones into.

710
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:20,143
Rym: Yup.

711
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:21,050
Scott: Two stones.

712
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:23,790
Rym: I like Matt's idea of growing a bonsai tree to be a dice tower.

713
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:26,290
Scott: That would be... If he does it, that would be incredible.

714
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:30,110
Rym: That is the... That is the... That is a power artifact if that has ever happened.

715
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:30,728
Rym: If that happens.

716
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:36,510
Scott: Dude, any... You could not... You could not argue with the result of any die that emerges from that tower.

717
00:35:36,831 --> 00:35:38,089
Rym: So I really like my bed.

718
00:35:38,832 --> 00:35:40,770
Rym: But it's an old world bed.

719
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:44,730
Rym: It's like this cherry oak thing with slats and a box spring and a mattress.

720
00:35:46,452 --> 00:35:48,350
Rym: There is modern bed technology.

721
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:59,190
Rym: I kind of want a modern bed with like the integrated nightstand, the drawers of storage under it, the low form factor as opposed to the super high form factor.

722
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:03,510
Rym: One modern mattress instead of a box spring and a mattress.

723
00:36:04,451 --> 00:36:07,070
Rym: But it's a pain in the ass to buy big furniture.

724
00:36:07,631 --> 00:36:10,229
Rym: And I got to figure out what to do with the old furniture and I want to just throw it away.

725
00:36:10,773 --> 00:36:17,030
Scott: Yeah, furniture's main problem is that it's not... Depending on the quality you get, it could be very, very expensive.

726
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:21,390
Scott: And but mostly it's also just so big to move around.

727
00:36:21,711 --> 00:36:23,310
Rym: Which is not a problem in suburbia.

728
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:24,429
Rym: It's only a problem for us.

729
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:25,078
Scott: Yeah.

730
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,070
Scott: And the thing... You're talking about stuff like storage, right?

731
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:32,050
Scott: It's like if you live in a house, you don't care about under bed storage.

732
00:36:33,135 --> 00:36:35,910
Scott: You have enough room that you don't need to cram stuff into every little space.

733
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:41,530
Scott: But when you live in an apartment, you need to use every single square inch of air to store things.

734
00:36:41,971 --> 00:36:46,030
Scott: Even if you minimize things, you still are going to need more space to put things.

735
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:46,660
Rym: I got 14-foot ceilings.

736
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:50,930
Rym: Look, you should see how vertical my desk is and how much shit is up there.

737
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:52,810
Scott: And it could be even more vertical.

738
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:53,909
Scott: There's a white space out there.

739
00:36:54,231 --> 00:36:54,748
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

740
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:58,449
Rym: If I own this apartment, there'd be a fucking loft bed up there.

741
00:36:59,193 --> 00:36:59,338
Scott: Why not?

742
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:00,096
Scott: Yeah.

743
00:37:01,017 --> 00:37:01,690
Scott: Is that even legal?

744
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:03,310
Rym: Sure.

745
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:04,310
Scott: Whatever.

746
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:05,570
Rym: Don't really care.

747
00:37:06,012 --> 00:37:06,910
Rym: I would have done it anyway.

748
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:11,070
Rym: I only didn't do it because I'm renting this place and I'd have to undo it if and when I move.

749
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:20,430
Scott: But yeah, so when you go to IKEA and you see all those crazy furnitures that are like storing stuff in weird places and having extra hidden compartments.

750
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:21,910
Rym: That's for city people.

751
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:22,807
Scott: That's for city people.

752
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:27,590
Rym: The problem with IKEA is that IKEA stuff tends to not survive ever being moved once.

753
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:39,429
Scott: I mean, IKEA stuff is really well designed and it's easy to get delivered because it comes apart and you put it together, which makes so you don't like worry about getting it up the elevator, up the stairs or anything like that, which is great.

754
00:37:40,151 --> 00:37:44,350
Scott: But it's made cheaply like the wood is not highest quality wood.

755
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:47,330
Scott: It's not like, you know, solid cherry, whatever.

756
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:47,750
Rym: Yeah.

757
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:50,089
Rym: Like I had a big IKEA desk and I went to move it.

758
00:37:50,491 --> 00:37:53,390
Scott: It's not a bonsai tree grown into the shape of a couch, right?

759
00:37:53,731 --> 00:37:56,630
Rym: It literally just fell apart into rubbish.

760
00:37:56,812 --> 00:37:58,049
Rym: Like it was a pile of rubble.

761
00:37:58,913 --> 00:37:59,830
Scott: Like you can't move it.

762
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:03,030
Scott: I think if you take it apart and make it into a pile of boards.

763
00:38:03,273 --> 00:38:04,330
Rym: I tried to do that one.

764
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:06,729
Scott: You could probably move it and reassemble it, but good luck.

765
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:08,650
Scott: We're going to need the instructions to reassemble it.

766
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:09,287
Scott: You threw those out.

767
00:38:09,471 --> 00:38:10,409
Rym: Oh, I tried to do that once.

768
00:38:10,731 --> 00:38:11,388
Rym: Problem is way worse.

769
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:15,170
Rym: A lot of the piece, like the joining, you lost like one screw and you're done.

770
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:19,770
Rym: No, the joining pieces had destroyed the inside parts of the wood they connected to.

771
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:21,489
Rym: So once you took them out, you can never put them back in again.

772
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:22,228
Rym: Fucked.

773
00:38:23,633 --> 00:38:25,710
Rym: Oh, well, like you couldn't put it back together.

774
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:26,310
Scott: Cheap, right?

775
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:30,430
Scott: To buy a quality furniture would cost more than twice the cost of the IKEA furniture.

776
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:32,970
Scott: So re buying the IKEA furniture is not the end of the world.

777
00:38:33,251 --> 00:38:37,930
Rym: My philosophy is pretty much when I move all the IKEA stuff just gets thrown away.

778
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:41,690
Scott: Well, I did move those IKEA Ivar shelves that my books, my bookshelf.

779
00:38:42,412 --> 00:38:45,630
Scott: Those are just pretty much like, that's like the most minimal furniture.

780
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:46,890
Scott: It's like some pieces.

781
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:48,889
Rym: I'm talking like computer desk.

782
00:38:49,613 --> 00:38:49,950
Scott: Exactly.

783
00:38:50,473 --> 00:38:50,990
Scott: Computer desk.

784
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:51,903
Scott: Got to know if you'll make it.

785
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:52,606
Rym: Yeah.

786
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:53,990
Rym: Computer desk was dicey enough.

787
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:55,430
Rym: Even just installing in this apartment.

788
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:58,030
Scott: Well, the computer desk I have now is actually really nice.

789
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:08,470
Scott: The main problem with it is that it's IKEA, but the painted surface of it like basically peeled off and it's like, it's like, you know, it's got like some kind of coating on it.

790
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:12,410
Scott: It's like, you know, it's wood with like some plastic shit and there's paint on the plastic.

791
00:39:12,511 --> 00:39:13,260
Scott: shit eroded away.

792
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:18,148
Rym: The one thing it's an IKEA, but we got like the upper end IKEA.

793
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:21,790
Rym: These are like all these chunks are like inch thick, solid wood.

794
00:39:22,713 --> 00:39:24,510
Rym: Like this is actually a for real sturdy.

795
00:39:24,711 --> 00:39:28,610
Scott: Imagine if like the black see like it's happening on the corners near yours, right?

796
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:30,568
Rym: You know why it's happening there?

797
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:36,610
Rym: Because I have this giant heavy ass microphone boom that I slam in this spot multiple times.

798
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:40,410
Scott: Mine happens in the spot where I rub my wrists.

799
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:43,069
Rym: Look, Emily's is the older one because we both have the exact same desk.

800
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:44,750
Rym: Hers doesn't have any problems.

801
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:46,030
Scott: She has a keyboard drawer.

802
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:46,949
Scott: She's not putting her hands.

803
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:48,510
Rym: I also have a keyboard drawer.

804
00:39:49,294 --> 00:39:49,750
Scott: Oh, see mine.

805
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:51,050
Scott: I'm putting my hands up on the desk.

806
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:55,830
Rym: When I look for a desk, keyboard drawer is like a deal breaker if it's not there.

807
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:56,156
Scott: Really?

808
00:39:56,671 --> 00:39:58,110
Rym: I really like the keyboard drawer.

809
00:39:58,310 --> 00:39:59,248
Scott: I don't like the keyboard drawer.

810
00:39:59,511 --> 00:40:00,810
Scott: I like going up on the surface.

811
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:03,990
Rym: I like the surface to be a lot higher than I should put my hands when I'm typing.

812
00:40:05,132 --> 00:40:07,810
Rym: And I want to type nice and low, lined up with my chair.

813
00:40:08,471 --> 00:40:13,366
Rym: And I like to pull the keyboard over my lap, but yet still have everything else be far away from me.

814
00:40:14,715 --> 00:40:15,402
Rym: I have a very, I am.

815
00:40:17,271 --> 00:40:26,570
Rym: I'm actually really kind of anally particular about the positioning of my hands, my feet, my mouse, my keyboard.

816
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:28,610
Scott: I feel like that's a separate show though, right?

817
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:29,082
Scott: That is.

818
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:30,489
Rym: So let's skip that.

819
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:32,409
Scott: So what other furnitures you got?

820
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:33,469
Rym: Remember the kitchen table?

821
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:34,768
Scott: Which one?

822
00:40:35,832 --> 00:40:42,910
Scott: The one that started out and that I grew up with or the one that's currently in my parents' Kitchen table is another thing that only matters to suburbanites.

823
00:40:44,291 --> 00:40:46,450
Rym: I really like having a really nice kitchen table.

824
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:47,210
Rym: We moved to Beacon.

825
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:49,250
Rym: We were like, ah, we need a kitchen table.

826
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:55,810
Scott: There's so many times now I don't have a kitchen table and there's so many times where I want ones like play a board game on, eat dinner on, you know?

827
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:58,470
Rym: Also a kitchen table is nice because they're like one big piece.

828
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:00,210
Rym: They're really solid.

829
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:02,070
Rym: They're really like, they're a fixture.

830
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:06,980
Rym: They're always really fucking useful to have a big table, but, uh, can't do that in the city.

831
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:08,125
Scott: There's nowhere to put it.

832
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:16,850
Rym: Instead, I got a crate and barrel collapsing table, which is a, it's great because I can like pull it out and need a big table and put it away.

833
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:19,829
Rym: We're not using it, but it's actually kind of a pain in the ass.

834
00:41:20,251 --> 00:41:23,449
Rym: Like to unfurl it is kind of a big to do.

835
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:24,350
Scott: Yeah.

836
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:29,062
Scott: And so you got to move a bunch of shit out of the way and it's not a lot of room to sit around it.

837
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:34,410
Rym: And it's nice, but it is not the solid rock of a kitchen table.

838
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:35,948
Scott: You can't really like lean on it.

839
00:41:36,271 --> 00:41:37,468
Scott: It's not the greatest idea.

840
00:41:37,854 --> 00:41:38,770
Rym: Also pretty expensive.

841
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:45,048
Rym: Yeah, but I mean, it works for our purposes, but it's the, it's the best choice for my life.

842
00:41:45,273 --> 00:41:46,390
Rym: It's not my preference.

843
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:47,630
Scott: No, it's not ideal.

844
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:48,189
Rym: My preference.

845
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:50,430
Rym: Actually, I want a ship's table.

846
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:53,630
Rym: If I owned an apartment, I would have a ship's table in the kitchen.

847
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:54,970
Scott: What kind of table is a ship's table?

848
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:57,170
Rym: A ship's table is on the ceiling.

849
00:41:57,412 --> 00:41:59,069
Scott: Isn't that where they put the maps?

850
00:41:59,650 --> 00:41:59,750
Rym: Yeah.

851
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:03,310
Rym: It's on the ceiling flush with the wall or the ceiling, right?

852
00:42:04,191 --> 00:42:08,127
Rym: And you hit a button and it gets lowered down and hangs.

853
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:10,928
Rym: So there's no legs, no legs.

854
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:13,189
Scott: So doesn't it swing around?

855
00:42:14,794 --> 00:42:16,110
Rym: Make it really, really heavy.

856
00:42:16,212 --> 00:42:16,908
Rym: So it's stable.

857
00:42:18,954 --> 00:42:19,950
Rym: Yeah, it'd be fine.

858
00:42:20,111 --> 00:42:22,610
Scott: I'd rather just have enough room to have a big old table.

859
00:42:23,211 --> 00:42:27,708
Rym: I would also rather, my ideal life is actually having, remember that house I bought and then didn't buy?

860
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:33,246
Scott: My ideal life, a mansion on top of an apartment building in Manhattan that is somehow in a tropical area.

861
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:40,770
Rym: Oh my gosh, Scott, you probably read that same Gothamist article I did about the people who live in a gigantic, basically cabin on the roof of a building in Manhattan.

862
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:41,525
Scott: Really?

863
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:42,058
Rym: Yeah.

864
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:44,949
Rym: It is, imagine the geek house, but twice as big.

865
00:42:45,692 --> 00:42:48,229
Rym: And then they have like a garden and a pool and all this stuff.

866
00:42:48,801 --> 00:42:48,970
Rym: Yeah.

867
00:42:49,273 --> 00:42:49,628
Rym: It's huge.

868
00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:50,190
Rym: It's amazing.

869
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:51,148
Scott: That's how rich people do.

870
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:52,109
Rym: I would do anything.

871
00:42:52,633 --> 00:42:54,309
Rym: I would, I might turn evil to get that.

872
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,530
Scott: Why don't you start a life of crime right now?

873
00:42:56,612 --> 00:42:57,083
Scott: Then you'll get it.

874
00:42:57,792 --> 00:42:59,310
Rym: It'd have to be a life of white collar crime.

875
00:42:59,631 --> 00:43:01,990
Rym: I got to rise higher through the ranks before I'm capable of that.

876
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:02,949
Scott: You can do that right now.

877
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:03,669
Scott: What's stopping you?

878
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:04,549
Rym: I got to start.

879
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:05,769
Rym: Go Joe Asami style.

880
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:06,604
Scott: Do it.

881
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:12,250
Rym: But yeah, ideally I'm a big fan of having purpose for like rooms with a purpose.

882
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:17,910
Rym: Like this is the gaming room and it's like a coo-turd a hundred percent for gaming.

883
00:43:18,832 --> 00:43:25,769
Rym: And this is the eating room and this is the socializing room and this is the watching media room, but I will likely never be rich enough to have that.

884
00:43:26,082 --> 00:43:26,168
Rym: No.

885
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:28,230
Rym: So as a result, I have this collapsing kitchen.

886
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:29,709
Scott: We can have that far, far away.

887
00:43:30,572 --> 00:43:34,990
Rym: But then when I still have the money to continue to do all the other things I like to do, because there's no jobs far, far away.

888
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:35,610
Scott: That's a shame.

889
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:42,609
Rym: So the funny thing was when I bought that table, Crate and Barrel does not sell collapsing chairs.

890
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:55,468
Rym: So I would have, so if I'd bought the set, I would have had this table that I can collapse and put away and for like giant fucking chairs that just take up a bunch of space that you can't do anything about.

891
00:43:56,032 --> 00:43:58,310
Rym: So I ordered like collapsing chairs on Amazon.

892
00:43:58,452 --> 00:43:58,800
Rym: Hmm.

893
00:43:59,732 --> 00:44:00,469
Rym: They work okay though.

894
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:01,527
Rym: They're not the worst.

895
00:44:02,873 --> 00:44:05,650
Rym: I have kind of gone for the minimal style.

896
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:13,550
Rym: Like I tend to like things that are very minimal, sleek, dark colors, thin lines, as little ornamentation as possible.

897
00:44:14,055 --> 00:44:14,145
Scott: Yeah.

898
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:23,530
Scott: I never really understood or like how like old people really fucking love ornate furniture, like couches with a pattern on the upholstery and really crazy ornate legs.

899
00:44:23,611 --> 00:44:25,390
Scott: And it's like, that shit belongs in a museum.

900
00:44:25,511 --> 00:44:27,885
Scott: That is not actually comfortable to sit on, right?

901
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:33,526
Scott: It's like, you can't just plop down on that in front of the TV and eating food on it every day.

902
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:33,850
Rym: Yeah.

903
00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:35,849
Rym: Remember the golden compass where what's her name is?

904
00:44:36,151 --> 00:44:42,629
Rym: She comes to the modern world and she's like, you really sure this is a university because everything looks kind of gray and plain.

905
00:44:43,232 --> 00:44:44,669
Rym: That's not how universities work.

906
00:44:47,431 --> 00:44:52,170
Scott: But yeah, so I was like, you know, my couch is gray little rectangle.

907
00:44:53,072 --> 00:44:55,090
Scott: There's nothing exciting about how it looks, right?

908
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:58,250
Scott: It's just fancy because the way it folds out and has a little storage.

909
00:44:58,472 --> 00:45:00,690
Rym: My desk is black and white.

910
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:01,660
Rym: My chair black.

911
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:03,349
Rym: The microphone booth.

912
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:07,770
Scott: I don't know enough about interior design to not make everything as black as possible.

913
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:08,353
Rym: Yup.

914
00:45:10,433 --> 00:45:13,310
Rym: But I like really, really minimalist design.

915
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:17,490
Rym: Like my ideal furniture is really, really sleek and modern looking.

916
00:45:18,292 --> 00:45:21,810
Rym: And the problem is that's actually the most expensive furniture.

917
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:24,550
Rym: Like I've gotten a few things.

918
00:45:24,773 --> 00:45:26,108
Rym: I like those lamps I have out there.

919
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:32,870
Rym: They're like, they're like, I like that style a lot, but those things are like, lean on them the wrong way once and they'll just collapse into Ikea rubbish.

920
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:38,010
Scott: There's a lot of like fancy furniture places or it's like designer furniture.

921
00:45:38,290 --> 00:45:39,750
Rym: I salivate walking past those places.

922
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:46,145
Scott: It's like they have, you know, the same way that, you know, some people will walk past like the designer clothing store where it's like famous designers.

923
00:45:46,206 --> 00:45:47,510
Scott: name is the name of the store.

924
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:50,690
Scott: They have like one dress and one suit that are like ten thousand dollars each.

925
00:45:51,199 --> 00:45:51,410
Scott: Right.

926
00:45:51,791 --> 00:46:04,230
Scott: This furniture store is like, I know one of them is like Bo concept and then some other ones where it's like, maybe they're a chain, but really it's just ridiculously expensive, fancy designer furniture.

927
00:46:04,451 --> 00:46:07,170
Scott: Like you'll see in an apartment, in a movie or some shit.

928
00:46:07,774 --> 00:46:08,990
Scott: It's like, man, I want that.

929
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:12,810
Rym: I mean, I want a sunken living room and like ultra minimal.

930
00:46:13,391 --> 00:46:16,949
Scott: You walk down a couple of stairs to get down to the carpeted area.

931
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:20,189
Rym: Bocurano, one of the characters, their apartment is like that.

932
00:46:20,592 --> 00:46:23,810
Rym: And I just as soon as I like, I remember I was watching the show and I paused it.

933
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:24,489
Rym: I just looked at it.

934
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:26,749
Rym: I was like, wow, my God, I want to live in this thing.

935
00:46:26,893 --> 00:46:27,288
Rym: Oh, yeah.

936
00:46:28,512 --> 00:46:28,969
Rym: See, we're old.

937
00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:29,989
Rym: This is what we care about now.

938
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:35,969
Scott: The thing is, though, like couches, it seems to me like the pricing on a lot of couches is sort of backwards.

939
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:38,330
Rym: The cheaper couches tend to be better.

940
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:38,598
Rym: Yeah.

941
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:42,470
Scott: I mean, people when they're charging a lot of money for a couch, it's usually leather.

942
00:46:42,791 --> 00:46:45,868
Scott: I see that as a negative because it gets all sticky when it's warm and whatnot.

943
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:49,750
Rym: And if you if you like and you get it very easily, real expensive.

944
00:46:50,296 --> 00:46:51,630
Scott: You know, you're living in this place.

945
00:46:51,811 --> 00:46:52,669
Scott: You're using this couch a lot.

946
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:53,207
Scott: You're a nerd.

947
00:46:53,370 --> 00:46:56,550
Scott: You need a durable couch, not a easily ruined leather couch.

948
00:46:56,671 --> 00:46:59,110
Scott: Also, a lot of them are way too squishy.

949
00:46:59,857 --> 00:47:00,110
Scott: Right.

950
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:02,208
Scott: It's like I can't be doing something squishy.

951
00:47:02,721 --> 00:47:02,889
Rym: Yeah.

952
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:03,058
Rym: Right.

953
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:09,450
Scott: I need something that's like, well, really, it needs to be somewhat squishy to be comfortable, but a lot of them are like poof and you fall into it.

954
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:10,226
Scott: It's beyond that.

955
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:13,770
Rym: Most couches are just too bulky.

956
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:16,269
Rym: They take up way too much space.

957
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:17,728
Scott: Well, they're so poofy with air.

958
00:47:17,936 --> 00:47:18,085
Rym: Yep.

959
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:21,550
Rym: But also like they have really, really wide armrests for no reason.

960
00:47:21,872 --> 00:47:30,430
Rym: And they tend to be really dense and heavy and have all this like extra stuff like the fold out bed and multiple recliners and like the L-shaped sectional.

961
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:34,908
Scott: Well, the L-shaped sectional, right, is sort of a good thing because, number one, In suburbia.

962
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:38,010
Scott: Yeah, but you can get enough sections to match whatever room you've got.

963
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:41,650
Scott: So as for the manufacturer, it's like, well, this one couch fits all rooms.

964
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:43,410
Scott: You can just buy one little section and get your own.

965
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:48,387
Rym: Ah, but that's such a plebeian style of interior design because that's the suburban.

966
00:47:48,428 --> 00:47:49,860
Rym: interior design is always the same.

967
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:52,860
Rym: Every cover, every wall is shit, right?

968
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:55,420
Rym: And there's nothing in the middle of the room except maybe a coffee table.

969
00:47:55,560 --> 00:48:01,755
Scott: Other thing is the L-shape allows you to have maximum seating where no one is as an obstructed view of the TV.

970
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:03,278
Scott: Exactly.

971
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,040
Scott: And but but you have lots and lots of seats.

972
00:48:07,282 --> 00:48:09,099
Scott: You know, where are you going to put two couches?

973
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,040
Scott: You know, one with a space in the corner.

974
00:48:11,383 --> 00:48:15,218
Scott: If you have a space in the corner with a coffee table, well, you just lost like two seats over there.

975
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:23,540
Scott: Yeah, the L-shape allows you to get maximum seating all in, you know, no matter what shape your room is, usually rooms or squares or rectangles.

976
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:31,159
Rym: But I guess what bothers me is that that kind of furniture assumes a big living room, not a fan or family room, really.

977
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:37,239
Rym: Well, if you're from the United States Midwest, there's a there's a distinct difference between a family room and a living room.

978
00:48:37,621 --> 00:48:41,319
Rym: But I which is weird because the family room is the room that you live in.

979
00:48:41,703 --> 00:48:43,140
Rym: And the living room is the room with the furniture.

980
00:48:43,301 --> 00:48:44,040
Rym: You're not allowed to touch that.

981
00:48:45,444 --> 00:48:50,032
Scott: Also, you know, some of the features of the L-shaped couch, like the recliners at the end, it's like.

982
00:48:50,375 --> 00:48:50,899
Rym: that's not bad.

983
00:48:51,401 --> 00:48:58,760
Scott: It's better than having a recliner standing on its own, taking up a whole big area because it's got to spin freely.

984
00:48:59,141 --> 00:49:03,180
Rym: And I could not imagine even having a recliner of any kind in New York.

985
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:03,304
Rym: Yep.

986
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:09,999
Rym: But because we had this thing, we had this blue recliner, a proper lazy boy that I brought with us to RIT.

987
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:14,260
Rym: That thing would barely fit in the GeekNights studio.

988
00:49:14,481 --> 00:49:15,599
Rym: It is so big.

989
00:49:16,102 --> 00:49:17,759
Scott: It would be like the only furniture in this room.

990
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:21,138
Rym: It was so comfortable, though, is OK.

991
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:24,880
Scott: I mean, people you could sleep in it if you really want to recline into a full bed.

992
00:49:25,081 --> 00:49:25,787
Scott: But it wasn't.

993
00:49:26,191 --> 00:49:27,220
Scott: it wasn't that comfortable.

994
00:49:27,522 --> 00:49:28,332
Rym: Well, it was.

995
00:49:28,353 --> 00:49:28,920
Rym: I liked it.

996
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:29,379
Rym: It was old.

997
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:30,139
Rym: That was his problem.

998
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:42,780
Rym: But that style assumes that you have a room with a TV and the TV is the centerpiece of all interaction and that you will never put anything in the middle of the room, except maybe a coffee table.

999
00:49:43,221 --> 00:49:47,119
Rym: And you will put the couch at the edge of the room, filling all the walls.

1000
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:59,659
Rym: Better interior design is to have a couch that might still be an L, but it's a chase at the end instead of just a sectional, because then you can lounge on it.

1001
00:50:00,001 --> 00:50:04,479
Rym: You can sit in multiple directions and you put that shit in the middle of the room.

1002
00:50:04,861 --> 00:50:09,340
Scott: Yeah, that's pretty much the one thing I learned from.

1003
00:50:09,761 --> 00:50:12,400
Scott: I didn't you know, I guess my furniture is mostly IKEA.

1004
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:18,399
Scott: But, you know, I looked in the IKEA catalog and I was like, I want an apartment that looks like this, but I can't hire someone to come and do it for me.

1005
00:50:18,941 --> 00:50:24,940
Scott: But I'm looking and I'm like, you know, all these pictures in the IKEA catalog, it's they're always showing rooms full of so much stuff.

1006
00:50:25,642 --> 00:50:27,580
Scott: It's like, man, how do they get all this stuff in all these rooms?

1007
00:50:27,801 --> 00:50:32,359
Scott: They're obviously filling the rooms with stuff because they need to show as much stuff as possible in each picture to sell it.

1008
00:50:32,811 --> 00:50:32,980
Scott: Right.

1009
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:35,218
Scott: They're not doing it because anyone should actually live like that.

1010
00:50:36,242 --> 00:50:39,500
Scott: But I realized, hey, in all these pictures, it's like they got shit.

1011
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:46,140
Scott: You know, like my furniture arrangement used to just be put everything against the wall in the middle of the rooms empty because that's what we all grew up with.

1012
00:50:46,281 --> 00:50:46,918
Scott: I didn't know any better.

1013
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:51,802
Rym: If you grew up in a house where like space is not necessarily at a premium, that's just like.

1014
00:50:51,822 --> 00:50:53,520
Rym: that's what all the furniture you will ever see.

1015
00:50:54,101 --> 00:50:55,740
Scott: But I looked at the pictures in the IKEA catalog.

1016
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:02,000
Scott: I realized, hey, all of these pictures against the wall are shelves and the couch isn't against the wall.

1017
00:51:02,061 --> 00:51:03,859
Scott: The couch is in front of the shelves.

1018
00:51:04,341 --> 00:51:09,020
Scott: So my apartment, that's the one innovation I have is that the bookshelves are against the wall.

1019
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:09,877
Scott: Then there's a space.

1020
00:51:10,262 --> 00:51:11,138
Scott: Then there's the couch.

1021
00:51:11,581 --> 00:51:15,435
Scott: And because of that, I can fit all those bookshelves in my apartment.

1022
00:51:15,455 --> 00:51:20,180
Scott: that otherwise if I put the couch up against the wall, I'd have more room in the middle of the room.

1023
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:20,940
Rym: That's useless.

1024
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,929
Scott: It might be a little bit more comfortable.

1025
00:51:22,949 --> 00:51:27,040
Scott: to like, you know, lay down on the couch or a little farther from the TV is a little nicer.

1026
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:30,259
Scott: But where would I keep all these books?

1027
00:51:31,002 --> 00:51:31,378
Scott: Nowhere.

1028
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:37,660
Scott: So because we have a much bigger apartment and it would look and looking at the couch, it would look way worse.

1029
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:44,780
Scott: Just looking at me sitting on a couch with a white wall behind me with some art on it versus, you know, couch with bookshelf behind.

1030
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:46,920
Scott: It actually looks sort of IKEA catalog.

1031
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:50,920
Rym: Yeah, a little bit like Scott's apartment, like your apartment is actually pretty classy.

1032
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:51,659
Rym: Not right now.

1033
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,299
Scott: Right now it looks like a bomb hit.

1034
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:57,960
Rym: The last time I visited it, it was very classy because you would probably cleaned it recently.

1035
00:51:58,605 --> 00:52:00,359
Rym: There's like garbage all over the sky.

1036
00:52:01,025 --> 00:52:01,580
Rym: Take heart.

1037
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:02,899
Rym: Like you see my apartment now.

1038
00:52:03,041 --> 00:52:03,460
Rym: It's pretty good.

1039
00:52:05,073 --> 00:52:05,720
Rym: Two weeks ago.

1040
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,317
Rym: That was not the case.

1041
00:52:08,101 --> 00:52:08,779
Scott: So bad right now.

1042
00:52:09,422 --> 00:52:10,720
Rym: I got I got right.

1043
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,960
Scott: There was no point of such good interior decorating if you just make a big old mess.

1044
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:25,100
Rym: So our apartment, because we have the bigger living room, what we did is we have the same couch as Scott with a chase L on the end, but it's against the back wall.

1045
00:52:25,482 --> 00:52:28,520
Rym: But the chase is not against the window wall.

1046
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,918
Rym: It's actually step back from it to give a sense of space.

1047
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:37,777
Rym: And then next to it to the right is another chase lounge that comes sticks out into the middle of the room.

1048
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,106
Rym: So the L is really.

1049
00:52:40,146 --> 00:52:45,760
Rym: there's a U going into the middle of the room and then to complete the U into a full square.

1050
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:59,414
Rym: If people come over and we're not just watching TV, then we pull out all the floor pillows and the ottoman and we all sit in a square looking at each other because we talk to each other.

1051
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:06,099
Rym: It's not what it seems like happens at most people's houses in suburbia where everything's facing the TV all the time.

1052
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:09,839
Rym: We actually put stuff between the TV and us unless we're using the TV.

1053
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:11,999
Scott: And then the people turn around and look at the TV.

1054
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:16,799
Rym: Well, because usually around 11 o'clock, someone puts on some gifts with sound and then we all get hypnotized.

1055
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:17,938
Rym: And that is the end of the night.

1056
00:53:18,602 --> 00:53:19,000
Scott: Hypnotized.

1057
00:53:23,401 --> 00:53:29,319
Rym: Uh, I'm tired of shelves because I realized that if I have a big shelf, I put stuff on it never to be pulled off again.

1058
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:38,600
Scott: Uh, I just don't like shelves that you mount to the wall because no matter how securely they are fastened to studs, they're going to fall.

1059
00:53:39,442 --> 00:53:39,678
Scott: They're not.

1060
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:40,479
Scott: It's all right.

1061
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:44,720
Scott: So I need shelves that stand on the floor and I only put books on them.

1062
00:53:44,961 --> 00:53:47,380
Scott: We're thinking about trying to clear them out as much as possible.

1063
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:56,840
Rym: We're thinking of folding up the drafting table here because Emily doesn't use it that often and just putting big fucking shelves here and putting all the board games here out in the middle of the room instead of in the closet, instead of in the closet.

1064
00:53:57,201 --> 00:54:02,379
Rym: And then I'm going to put all the stuff I don't use that often in the closet and the stuff you don't use ever away.

1065
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:06,776
Rym: And then anytime Emily needs to use this, the actual drafting table, how often does she use it?

1066
00:54:07,082 --> 00:54:08,939
Rym: Not that often on depends on what she's working on.

1067
00:54:09,461 --> 00:54:14,592
Rym: She'll just open it in the middle of the room and use it and then put it away when she's done.

1068
00:54:15,163 --> 00:54:16,980
Rym: So that's our strategy right now with this room.

1069
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:20,200
Rym: Now that all that stuff under there can fit in the closet.

1070
00:54:21,585 --> 00:54:22,559
Rym: It can actually now.

1071
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:23,620
Rym: It just couldn't before.

1072
00:54:24,101 --> 00:54:24,798
Rym: Also, we had a problem.

1073
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:26,840
Rym: We accidentally bought way too much paper towel.

1074
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:28,740
Scott: I can see this has happened.

1075
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:31,360
Scott: Why didn't you accidentally buy too much toilet paper instead?

1076
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:34,280
Rym: Those two problems were related and that is the result.

1077
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,839
Rym: And we since fixed it, but we only solved half of the problem.

1078
00:54:37,101 --> 00:54:41,619
Rym: Well, no, we solved the full problem and we've been burning through that paper towel stash for like six months.

1079
00:54:41,921 --> 00:54:42,900
Scott: How about the toilet paper?

1080
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:44,040
Rym: We have plenty of toilet paper.

1081
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:44,426
Scott: Sure.

1082
00:54:45,062 --> 00:54:45,718
Rym: Yeah, we actually do.

1083
00:54:45,901 --> 00:54:47,219
Scott: Yes, one roll is not plenty.

1084
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:49,039
Rym: There's way more than one roll.

1085
00:54:50,121 --> 00:54:53,320
Scott: I meant one Rym roll, which is like three poops, which is three rolls.

1086
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:57,298
Rym: I don't know why you're obsessed with the fact that I clean my asshole when I also clean my asshole.

1087
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,720
Scott: It does not take me as much toilet paper to clean my asshole.

1088
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,080
Scott: Is your poop really that dirty?

1089
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:03,600
Rym: I suspect that you do not in fact clean your asshole that way.

1090
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:04,720
Scott: You want to come look at my asshole?

1091
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:05,679
Rym: You want to come look at mine?

1092
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:10,579
Rym: Do we need to have a third neutral third party analyze them?

1093
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:11,412
Scott: Fast man.

1094
00:55:13,225 --> 00:55:14,658
Rym: Do you want to know what the problem is?

1095
00:55:16,505 --> 00:55:16,840
Scott: Yeah.

1096
00:55:17,123 --> 00:55:17,398
Scott: All right.

1097
00:55:17,942 --> 00:55:20,679
Rym: But like I'm sick of, you know what I'm really sick of?

1098
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,247
Rym: Cheap shelves lining up the wall.

1099
00:55:24,009 --> 00:55:32,019
Rym: because we're like those like that, that one really tall Ikea bookshelf that every nerd is like four of next to each other bookshelf.

1100
00:55:32,342 --> 00:55:32,410
Rym: Yep.

1101
00:55:33,404 --> 00:55:34,119
Rym: I'm done with that.

1102
00:55:35,061 --> 00:55:40,300
Scott: Actually, I was a kid because we had the Ivar ones, which is sort of like more, you can just look them up online.

1103
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:42,618
Rym: They're like industrially like, I like them.

1104
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:45,660
Rym: That's a good kind of shelf, but they're just the VAR part.

1105
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:47,899
Scott: And flexible and what you can do with them.

1106
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:49,719
Scott: That's, that's the reason I have those.

1107
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:49,929
Scott: Yep.

1108
00:55:50,361 --> 00:55:51,380
Scott: It's like, I need a manga shelf.

1109
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:52,519
Scott: Let me put more shelves here.

1110
00:55:52,842 --> 00:55:55,659
Scott: Oh, this one has tall trades and is farther apart the books.

1111
00:55:56,260 --> 00:56:05,468
Rym: It's, it's barely furniture, but the one furniture item it's, it's, it's, it's either furniture or furnishing depending on the kind of house.

1112
00:56:06,351 --> 00:56:12,440
Rym: a kitchen has to have either an island or a butcher's block on wheels in the middle of the room.

1113
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:14,240
Scott: I need the block on wheels.

1114
00:56:14,541 --> 00:56:19,600
Scott: Maybe someone who I've been asking to make me one could actually do that unless they're just shit talking, which case I should buy one.

1115
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:22,780
Rym: Are you going to follow through and like literally bother them to work on it?

1116
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:28,340
Scott: Listen, I've been bothering them and they're just like, why is it my job to bother them?

1117
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:32,319
Scott: It's like, I just want, they're the ones I'm going to pay money to make it, make it.

1118
00:56:32,805 --> 00:56:33,538
Scott: I'll give you money.

1119
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:35,220
Scott: I'm not, not serious.

1120
00:56:35,423 --> 00:56:36,560
Scott: I am a hundred percent serious.

1121
00:56:37,181 --> 00:56:38,840
Scott: There is not no lack of seriousness.

1122
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:42,860
Scott: Whoever I desperately need this article of furniture that I do not have.

1123
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:47,380
Rym: What I really want, but again, I need to build it is above the island in my kitchen.

1124
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:52,260
Rym: I want one of those big metal racks that chefs can hang all their pots and pans and things from.

1125
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:59,660
Scott: I think you should just get the, uh, three baskets, the big basket, medium basket, and small basket that also hang like right on top of each other.

1126
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:00,900
Rym: We had that for a long time.

1127
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:01,739
Rym: It was a pain in the ass.

1128
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:02,859
Rym: We put bananas in it.

1129
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:04,138
Scott: That's what the bananas go.

1130
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:05,297
Rym: I got rid of that thing.

1131
00:57:08,004 --> 00:57:08,699
Scott: That's what that's for.

1132
00:57:09,321 --> 00:57:10,920
Scott: I put my bananas like on top of microwave.

1133
00:57:11,142 --> 00:57:13,439
Rym: I put my bananas on top of bananas on top of the bread box.

1134
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:14,728
Scott: Same thing.

1135
00:57:18,062 --> 00:57:23,140
Rym: For me, wine cabinet that also holds like all my fancy glassware is super important.

1136
00:57:23,341 --> 00:57:23,818
Scott: I don't need that.

1137
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:28,120
Rym: No, Scott doesn't care about that, but I have the same wine cabinet that I've had forever.

1138
00:57:28,563 --> 00:57:30,040
Rym: That was like my parents.

1139
00:57:30,621 --> 00:57:36,540
Scott: I should get, I should get a barrel that you normally would put like beer in that has a tap and fill it with like apple juice.

1140
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,260
Rym: Well, the reason you do that is because it's carbonated.

1141
00:57:42,122 --> 00:57:43,699
Scott: So you're saying the apple juice won't come out of the tap?

1142
00:57:44,262 --> 00:57:46,980
Rym: You know, I'm saying that you would do that if you wanted carbonated apple juice.

1143
00:57:47,281 --> 00:57:48,940
Scott: Just putting it in the barrel is going to carbonate.

1144
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:52,180
Rym: Oh, you only, you're thinking like a wine barrel with like the bunghole.

1145
00:57:52,881 --> 00:57:54,920
Scott: You know, just a barrel that has a tap on the front.

1146
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:55,193
Scott: Yeah.

1147
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:55,440
Rym: I see.

1148
00:57:55,600 --> 00:58:01,267
Scott: I was imagining like, I'll take, I'll take a cold frosty mug out of the freezer and then right.

1149
00:58:01,743 --> 00:58:01,828
Scott: Yeah.

1150
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:04,179
Scott: Like a Cooper's barrel with the two metal rings around it.

1151
00:58:04,463 --> 00:58:04,956
Scott: It's sideways.

1152
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:06,599
Rym: That can be pretty bad ass.

1153
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:08,459
Scott: I just put it at an apple cider comes out.

1154
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:10,771
Scott: Things that are not alcoholic will not keep in one of those.

1155
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:14,298
Scott: Why wouldn't it keep?

1156
00:58:14,761 --> 00:58:15,840
Rym: Because it's warm.

1157
00:58:21,203 --> 00:58:22,297
Scott: I'll put water in that.

1158
00:58:23,621 --> 00:58:27,220
Rym: So I do have a conundrum there because you know, like I want to get a new bed, but I have a really nice bed.

1159
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:28,679
Rym: Those have been in my family for a long time.

1160
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:30,720
Rym: The wine cabinets, the same thing.

1161
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:32,660
Rym: It's this really nice cherry oak wine cabinet.

1162
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,460
Rym: I've had for a long goddamn time.

1163
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,300
Rym: I like family, family history.

1164
00:58:36,428 --> 00:58:36,558
Scott: Yeah.

1165
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:39,840
Scott: Furniture is like this antique action that like other stuff doesn't have.

1166
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:41,680
Scott: You got an old computer, you don't really.

1167
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:43,180
Scott: It's like, Oh, I'll replace that shit.

1168
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:43,699
Scott: It's no problem.

1169
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:48,960
Rym: Like the other day I was in a crate and barrel cause like I needed a thing and I looked at like the modern wine cabinet they have.

1170
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:49,900
Rym: It's not the best wine cabinet.

1171
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:51,120
Scott: It's way better than the one you have though.

1172
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:51,356
Rym: Yeah.

1173
00:58:51,380 --> 00:59:00,120
Rym: It's like, I wouldn't buy that one, but that kind of wine cabinet, I really, really, really, really want and it would be perfect.

1174
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,659
Scott: There's nothing wrong with the one you got.

1175
00:59:02,202 --> 00:59:06,540
Rym: And I don't want to just throw this away cause it's a really nice piece of furniture.

1176
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:10,140
Rym: It'll be really hard and a pain in the ass to actually like sell it to someone.

1177
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:14,080
Scott: Furniture is like so durable that usually there's nothing wrong with it.

1178
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:15,640
Scott: It's like, just keep using it forever.

1179
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:22,080
Scott: It'd be really, it's really hard for furniture to get to a point where it's like, it needs to be replaced from a couch, from a colony.

1180
00:59:22,961 --> 00:59:23,463
Scott: We threw away.

1181
00:59:23,544 --> 00:59:33,359
Scott: either needs to get ridiculously dirty or broken while moving because it's not going to break just sitting there unless it's a couch and someone sits on it too hard or a bed and someone jumps on it too hard.

1182
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:43,639
Scott: I told someone like when they, like they saw those, we were moving out of beak or a chair and someone sits on it too hard and they were like, why aren't you keeping the couch or table and someone bangs on it too hard or flips it too hard.

1183
00:59:43,962 --> 00:59:46,160
Rym: And all I said when they asked, why aren't you keeping the couch?

1184
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:47,559
Rym: As I said, that couch is white.

1185
00:59:49,862 --> 00:59:52,539
Rym: And they looked at it and they said something to the effect of, yeah, you should burn that couch.

1186
00:59:54,623 --> 00:59:55,700
Scott: People do burn couches.

1187
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:57,259
Scott: They're pretty flammable.

1188
00:59:59,842 --> 01:00:02,239
Rym: And so that has not happened to us in a long time.

1189
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:03,820
Rym: All right.

1190
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:05,020
Rym: I think we've talked enough about furniture.

1191
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:07,820
Rym: Tell us your stories of wheel and woe related to furniture.

1192
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:09,560
Scott: We don't know that much about furniture.

1193
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,118
Scott: We know what the average person knows.

1194
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:18,920
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1195
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:24,060
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1196
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:29,480
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

1197
01:00:29,721 --> 01:00:32,400
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1198
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:37,140
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1199
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:40,656
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1200
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:44,940
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1201
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:48,080
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
