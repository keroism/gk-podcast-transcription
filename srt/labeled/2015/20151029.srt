1
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:11,498
Guest 0: [Laughter] Alright, let's do a show.

2
00:00:13,442 --> 00:00:15,900
Rym: So we are here with Joe and Conrad.

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,578
Scott: People who are here too often.

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:18,224
Scott: Yay!

5
00:00:19,361 --> 00:00:20,580
Scott: Actually, Joe has not been here before.

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,080
Rym: Partly when we wanted to start up our old, we used to do those profiles in geek.

7
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,480
Rym: I think the last one we really did was Gerald from anime world order.

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,420
Scott: That was not a shtick that lasted long.

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,418
Guest 0: I was worried it was me.

10
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:33,327
Rym: I want to bring it back.

11
00:00:33,347 --> 00:00:34,540
Rym: I want to bring it back hard.

12
00:00:34,962 --> 00:00:35,519
Scott: Well, it's all you.

13
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:36,819
Rym: We've never had Josephine on the show.

14
00:00:38,465 --> 00:00:40,276
Rym: [Coughing] Uh oh.

15
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,491
Guest 0: And we never will.

16
00:00:41,572 --> 00:00:41,960
Guest 0: Rym died.

17
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:42,455
Guest 0: Portons.

18
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,079
Rym: But no, we've never had Josephine on the show.

19
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:51,399
Rym: And also, shameless self-promotion because there's a Kickstarter that we kind of want you guys to plug a little bit right now.

20
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,039
Guest 1: Go to hustlecatgame.com.

21
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,399
Guest 1: Go to hustlecatgame.com.

22
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,177
Guest 0: Hustlecatgame.com.

23
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,692
Rym: So what is Hustlecat?

24
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,220
Guest 1: Hustlecat is a visual novel that's set in a cat cafe.

25
00:01:01,941 --> 00:01:03,587
Scott: Is it a cat cafe?

26
00:01:03,648 --> 00:01:06,560
Scott: like it's a normal cafe and then you can pet cats in the back?

27
00:01:07,483 --> 00:01:11,560
Guest 1: I mean, it's a cat cafe where there's food and coffee and cats and cakes.

28
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:12,999
Scott: Do you buy cats there?

29
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:13,958
Guest 1: You can.

30
00:01:14,565 --> 00:01:15,318
Guest 0: You cannot buy cats.

31
00:01:15,863 --> 00:01:15,906
Guest 1: No?

32
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,579
Guest 1: They're all up for adoption like many of the fine cat cafes in both New York and D.C.

33
00:01:22,102 --> 00:01:23,899
Scott: So it's like a normal world cat cafe.

34
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,499
Scott: It's not a supernatural cat cafe.

35
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,100
Guest 1: It's a normal world cat cafe except for there's a magical curse for all of your.

36
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,640
Scott: You just said it wasn't supernatural and then you immediately talked about a magical curse.

37
00:01:34,462 --> 00:01:35,940
Guest 1: The cat cafe itself is fine.

38
00:01:36,146 --> 00:01:36,499
Guest 1: Oh, okay.

39
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:36,768
Guest 1: Yes.

40
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:42,220
Guest 1: It's just the people who work in the cat cafe also turn into cats and take shifts as cats.

41
00:01:42,641 --> 00:01:48,779
Guest 1: And it's a dating sim and there are six cute people and Scott is making the world's worst face to me but it is a dating sim.

42
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:52,700
Guest 1: We are $8,000 away from goal on Kickstarter.

43
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,238
Guest 1: Actually a little less than that.

44
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:55,660
Scott: It's not that much money at all.

45
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:00,960
Guest 1: And we've got seven days left and no, it's going great.

46
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,540
Guest 1: We've got some great artists on deck.

47
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:09,639
Guest 1: We've got a really passionate musician who's ready to do these kind of like chill but upbeat, you know, happy tracks.

48
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,880
Scott: I want to date a guy that would be playing on the radio in the cat cafe.

49
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,128
Guest 0: Well, they're kind of actually like.

50
00:02:14,149 --> 00:02:20,539
Guest 0: a lot of the stuff he's been working on recently has been like Shibuya K influenced, which like I think brings like like honestly, if you like Capsule.

51
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,440
Scott: Is the cat cafe in Japan?

52
00:02:23,783 --> 00:02:25,640
Guest 0: It is in magic town, magic world.

53
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,220
Scott: That's good.

54
00:02:26,561 --> 00:02:28,320
Guest 1: It's in the quote unquote big city.

55
00:02:29,042 --> 00:02:39,259
Guest 1: And some of the great features besides the music and art are that you get to define the look of your character by like hair length and skin tone.

56
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,260
Scott: Oh, you made like a cat character creator thing.

57
00:02:43,055 --> 00:02:43,200
Guest 1: Yeah.

58
00:02:43,302 --> 00:02:44,439
Guest 1: You get to pick your pronoun.

59
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,279
Scott: Are you a cat?

60
00:02:45,881 --> 00:02:48,660
Rym: Now the pronoun is independent of the look, right?

61
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,059
Scott: Correct.

62
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:49,587
Scott: Yeah.

63
00:02:50,380 --> 00:03:01,280
Guest 1: Everything is like specifically, you know, non-binary gendered and you just basically get to do everything like you can in Saints Row 4, which was my favorite part of Saints Row 4.

64
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:07,178
Guest 1: The fact that you could give like the male voice actor to a beautiful, large female bodied woman.

65
00:03:07,444 --> 00:03:08,100
Scott: Oh, is there voice acting?

66
00:03:08,882 --> 00:03:09,939
Guest 1: No, there won't be voice acting.

67
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,376
Scott: Not even like meow, meow.

68
00:03:13,046 --> 00:03:14,340
Guest 1: Do you want to do voice acting?

69
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,339
Guest 1: Are you auditioning?

70
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:16,851
Rym: We found our muse.

71
00:03:19,201 --> 00:03:20,040
Guest 0: It's getting in the tank.

72
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,303
Scott: So can you?

73
00:03:21,323 --> 00:03:23,580
Scott: can you turn into a cat too, or there's only the other people?

74
00:03:24,143 --> 00:03:25,380
Guest 1: That is a secret.

75
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:25,672
Scott: OK.

76
00:03:26,461 --> 00:03:28,519
Scott: If I date the right person, well I learn.

77
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,419
Rym: That definitely means yes.

78
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,099
Scott: Can you turn into a dog?

79
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:32,857
Scott: Are there dogs?

80
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,777
Guest 1: A hustle dog coming to the...

81
00:03:37,287 --> 00:03:38,072
Scott: There isn't a dog.

82
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,380
Scott: cat interaction situation.

83
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,879
Guest 0: Two million dollar stretch goal, hustle dog.

84
00:03:43,984 --> 00:03:47,179
Rym: You know, the only one of these cafes I've ever been to in the real world is a rabbit cafe.

85
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:54,058
Rym: And the funniest thing about it was that there are all these rabbits, they're like normal rabbits, but there's one rabbit who is the boss rabbit, Pumpu.

86
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:04,180
Rym: Like, he was a manly little rabbit and he was very social and kind of aggressive and not at all like rabbits I've known.

87
00:04:04,821 --> 00:04:08,980
Rym: So he would like come over and like check you out and play with you and do a lot of weird stuff.

88
00:04:09,122 --> 00:04:10,720
Rym: And he literally tried to steal my wallet.

89
00:04:11,323 --> 00:04:12,880
Scott: I'll only ask you a few more stupid questions.

90
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:13,557
Scott: Is there catnip?

91
00:04:14,602 --> 00:04:15,438
Guest 1: There should be catnip.

92
00:04:15,643 --> 00:04:16,199
Guest 0: There should be catnip.

93
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:16,978
Scott: Catnip is good.

94
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,459
Guest 0: So neither of us are the writers.

95
00:04:18,863 --> 00:04:20,839
Scott: Is there like a scratching post situation?

96
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,180
Guest 0: So, again, neither of us are the writers.

97
00:04:24,782 --> 00:04:27,220
Guest 0: We're programming and Jo is on production.

98
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,500
Scott: So you didn't get anything from the writers yet?

99
00:04:30,882 --> 00:04:32,840
Guest 0: We've gotten a lot of stuff from the writers.

100
00:04:33,484 --> 00:04:33,573
Guest 1: Yeah.

101
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,499
Scott: But you don't know if there's catnip involved yet.

102
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:39,780
Guest 1: I do know that a cat eats Chinese food and a cat eats pizza.

103
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,520
Scott: There might accidentally be catnip in a lot of Chinese food.

104
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,619
Scott: That could be a thing.

105
00:04:43,762 --> 00:04:43,955
Scott: Really?

106
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:44,598
Scott: Or pizza.

107
00:04:44,861 --> 00:04:45,159
Scott: Who knows?

108
00:04:47,062 --> 00:04:49,219
Guest 0: You thought it was oregano, but it was actually catnip.

109
00:04:49,982 --> 00:04:52,039
Guest 0: You're high as hell on these dollar slices.

110
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:56,980
Guest 1: It's a true fact that we took out all of the MSG and replaced it exclusively with catnip.

111
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,136
Guest 0: Catnip, I knew it.

112
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:04,240
Rym: So the interesting thing, and part of the reason why I wanted to get you on the show for GeekNights as a profile geek.

113
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,660
Scott: Because we need a Thursday episode badly.

114
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,480
Rym: Yeah, because I'm going out of town.

115
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,420
Rym: I got to go to a wedding on Thursday, so I'm going to be gone.

116
00:05:10,384 --> 00:05:10,696
Scott: That's why.

117
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:11,273
Rym: Yeah.

118
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,060
Rym: But also, I want to bring profiles and geek back.

119
00:05:14,341 --> 00:05:18,020
Rym: So this is basically an original project, right?

120
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:18,647
Guest 1: Yes.

121
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,620
Rym: So what goes into making a game of this scale?

122
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:26,160
Rym: Just as a company, as you guys producing this kind of thing.

123
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:31,780
Guest 1: Well, I think the first thing I did when I came on the project was make a calendar for everybody.

124
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,640
Guest 1: So organization is required.

125
00:05:34,842 --> 00:05:36,999
Guest 1: No matter what scale of a game you make.

126
00:05:37,621 --> 00:05:39,930
Guest 1: This past year, we've put out a 35,000 word game, a 17,000 word game.

127
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,740
Guest 1: And now this one's looking to be a pretty significant.

128
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,360
Scott: That's interesting.

129
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:47,737
Scott: You mentioned my words.

130
00:05:49,467 --> 00:05:50,840
Guest 1: Yeah, it's a visual novel.

131
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,320
Guest 1: It's mostly all reading.

132
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:58,340
Guest 1: So the word count is kind of accurately gauges how much effort someone is willing to put into it.

133
00:05:59,683 --> 00:06:02,453
Guest 1: The biggest Kickstarter ever for a visual novel.

134
00:06:02,514 --> 00:06:04,180
Guest 1: localization just happened.

135
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:06,539
Scott: Was that you or someone else?

136
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,039
Guest 0: It was Muff Love.

137
00:06:08,381 --> 00:06:08,687
Guest 0: Oh, yeah.

138
00:06:09,843 --> 00:06:11,620
Guest 1: But another one was very popular.

139
00:06:11,981 --> 00:06:15,054
Guest 1: And Grisaia rings in at about 400,000 words.

140
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:16,992
Guest 1: Oh, wow.

141
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,579
Guest 1: And people are incredibly excited about it.

142
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:26,780
Scott: So for scale, I guess like how many words was like Tokimeki Memorial on the PlayStation?

143
00:06:27,461 --> 00:06:35,040
Guest 0: Toki Memo is like a different benchmark because that game kind of had those like RNG elements and a lot of gameplay elements that you don't necessarily find in the visual novel.

144
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,580
Rym: I was thinking it was like a stat builder.

145
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:37,460
Guest 0: Yeah, yeah.

146
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:43,936
Guest 0: I think Joe's benchmark of Grisaia being close to half a million words is kind of the benchmark.

147
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,760
Guest 0: I know Muff Love, the series, was close to that.

148
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,880
Guest 0: Fate/Stay was just like a mind-numbing word count.

149
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,189
Rym: Well, The Hobbit is 95,000 words.

150
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:06,679
Scott: So if you play the game through reading really fast and pressing A a whole bunch and sort of making decisions rather quickly, like how many words per hour is kind of like typical?

151
00:07:09,124 --> 00:07:11,140
Guest 0: Can we just benchmark everything by The Hobbit?

152
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,100
Guest 0: We all read The Hobbit when we were counting to take you to read The Hobbit.

153
00:07:15,181 --> 00:07:17,440
Rym: I have no idea how long anything took when I was a kid.

154
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:23,180
Scott: Well, because I mean, we just read like four freaking Wheel of Time books in like a month.

155
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,379
Scott: And those are like this big.

156
00:07:24,581 --> 00:07:25,960
Rym: Have you guys read The Wheel of Time?

157
00:07:26,365 --> 00:07:26,840
Guest 1: I have not.

158
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,580
Guest 1: I have and I'm so sorry.

159
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,298
Rym: How far did you get?

160
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,338
Rym: Book three.

161
00:07:30,922 --> 00:07:35,960
Guest 1: Oh, when I realized that Perrin and Matt were doing the exact same thing, exact same time.

162
00:07:36,042 --> 00:07:36,939
Scott: Only Perrin's way cooler.

163
00:07:37,622 --> 00:07:38,260
Rym: Perrin's awesome.

164
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,517
Rym: And Matt just needs to shut up.

165
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,458
Rym: He needs to be quiet.

166
00:07:41,268 --> 00:07:41,719
Rym: Calm down.

167
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,359
Rym: Be quiet.

168
00:07:43,561 --> 00:07:44,559
Guest 1: Oh, he found a knife.

169
00:07:45,162 --> 00:07:46,754
Guest 1: It's scary for like 3000 pages.

170
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,617
Rym: Matt, why are you acting so strange?

171
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,940
Scott: Why do you keep doing things this spontaneously without thinking about them at all?

172
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,298
Scott: You guys are just selling me on this book.

173
00:07:58,242 --> 00:07:58,966
Rym: You know, I keep.

174
00:07:59,026 --> 00:08:01,280
Rym: we make fun of it so much, but we read four of them in a row.

175
00:08:01,422 --> 00:08:02,140
Scott: And they're this big.

176
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:05,480
Guest 0: They're like four and a half Song of Ice and Fire books.

177
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,138
Guest 0: So I feel you.

178
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:06,285
Guest 0: Whoa.

179
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,156
Guest 0: We've all been there.

180
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:07,756
Scott: Yeah.

181
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,579
Scott: I knew not to start this.

182
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,777
Rym: I read every Forgotten Realms book except the ones.

183
00:08:13,062 --> 00:08:15,300
Guest 1: But yeah, no, they're branching paths.

184
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,320
Guest 1: So sometimes people like to backtrack and make different dating decisions.

185
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,340
Guest 1: So it kind of changes based on how much patience you have.

186
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:27,490
Guest 1: We have friends who just roll through these games and like consume them voraciously.

187
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,740
Rym: So how do you how do you write or plan something like that in terms of like someone writing a novel?

188
00:08:32,602 --> 00:08:38,100
Rym: Like a lot of people might use specialized software, but it comes down to there's chapters and there's just one big work.

189
00:08:38,542 --> 00:08:39,700
Rym: How do you write a branching thing?

190
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,753
Rym: Like you just use notepad or word or Google Docs or like how do they?

191
00:08:43,813 --> 00:08:44,054
Rym: are there?

192
00:08:44,095 --> 00:08:45,640
Rym: tools like specialized tools?

193
00:08:46,603 --> 00:08:48,020
Guest 1: Some people like to draw it out.

194
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,540
Guest 1: I really like because I'm also in the middle of writing a game for date night.

195
00:08:51,680 --> 00:09:03,000
Guest 1: Oh, but I like to plan it out in in a program called Twine, which helps you kind of illustrate like it gives you a GUI for like kind of branching decisions.

196
00:09:04,508 --> 00:09:05,000
Guest 1: Special plug.

197
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,460
Guest 1: We are talking about branching narratives at gamer X in mid-December.

198
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,018
Guest 1: So if you're going to be in San Jose and I think it's December 10th through 13th.

199
00:09:15,044 --> 00:09:16,400
Guest 1: That's a good place to be in December.

200
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,120
Scott: It won't be free.

201
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:17,531
Guest 1: Right.

202
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:31,519
Guest 1: So the two of us and the writer of puzzle cat are going to be there talking about this kind of thing and talking about what it's like to write like a bi character and, you know, kind of make sexuality decisions based on, you know, who the character defines themselves as.

203
00:09:32,645 --> 00:09:33,158
Guest 1: That'll be neat.

204
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:39,300
Rym: But something that always bothered me in any game that ever let you date people is that some options just wouldn't like couldn't.

205
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,560
Scott: We were playing ruin factory four and all Rym wants to do is date everyone's mom.

206
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:47,560
Rym: And I'm like, well, no, I wanted to date the dragon and it wasn't working out.

207
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,120
Rym: Like she was being super nice to me, but she wouldn't date me.

208
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,800
Rym: And then I look online, you can't date the dragon.

209
00:09:51,984 --> 00:09:52,800
Rym: So that was bullshit.

210
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,820
Rym: Then I decided to date all the moms instead.

211
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,718
Rym: And you can't date them either.

212
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:03,520
Rym: If you rank the characters I wanted to date, literally everyone I want is at the top of the list and none of them are dateable.

213
00:10:03,621 --> 00:10:05,160
Rym: And then you get down to like the stupid warrior girl.

214
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,117
Rym: I don't care where your girls.

215
00:10:06,585 --> 00:10:07,219
Scott: It was my choice.

216
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:07,740
Guest 0: Well, I know.

217
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,820
Guest 0: I know this was actually somewhat of a point of contention for a dragon age.

218
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:15,180
Guest 0: The character Cassandra, I believe, would only date men and not women.

219
00:10:16,523 --> 00:10:18,720
Guest 0: And so this is actually a point.

220
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:19,597
Scott: But that's that character.

221
00:10:20,163 --> 00:10:20,679
Scott: It's not you.

222
00:10:20,922 --> 00:10:21,118
Scott: It's like.

223
00:10:21,502 --> 00:10:21,959
Scott: Right, right.

224
00:10:22,241 --> 00:10:24,600
Guest 0: But this has actually become a kind of a point of conversation.

225
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,707
Guest 0: It's something I'm really interested in tackling on.

226
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:28,674
Scott: this panel is like, there's a lot of people on.

227
00:10:28,774 --> 00:10:30,199
Scott: most people on this earth won't date me.

228
00:10:30,601 --> 00:10:33,220
Scott: It's like, what can I do about it?

229
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:38,759
Guest 0: I mean, you know, half of the population is a good looking guy.

230
00:10:39,001 --> 00:10:39,730
Scott: OK, over here.

231
00:10:41,903 --> 00:10:43,580
Rym: We're thinking about updating the GeekNights shirt.

232
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,859
Rym: I'm actually wearing our own GeekNights shirt right now.

233
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:50,980
Rym: I'm thinking about doing a stretch goal on the Patreon and having a classic Scott and new Scott variant.

234
00:10:51,663 --> 00:10:54,057
Rym: Oh, replace the top hair with the face hair.

235
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:56,560
Guest 0: Oh, southern migration.

236
00:10:58,046 --> 00:10:58,618
Guest 1: What was that?

237
00:10:59,303 --> 00:11:00,779
Guest 1: Oh, was it like Willy Willy?

238
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:04,540
Guest 1: What was that toy that had like the iron filings in it where you could change the hair?

239
00:11:04,826 --> 00:11:05,257
Scott: Oh, yeah.

240
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,480
Scott: Like any dollar store.

241
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,076
Scott: It's a great toy.

242
00:11:08,082 --> 00:11:09,720
Rym: I'll bet you that's a Cracker Barrel kind of thing.

243
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,779
Guest 1: Can you make Scott's face into one of those?

244
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,520
Rym: I guess I could.

245
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:17,159
Rym: That'll be a backer reward, I guess.

246
00:11:19,322 --> 00:11:19,864
Scott: So how much?

247
00:11:20,245 --> 00:11:24,160
Rym: in terms of a project like this, because I know a lot of our fans and people, they want to do Kickstarters.

248
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,739
Rym: They do like small projects or anything.

249
00:11:26,481 --> 00:11:31,680
Rym: How much work do you do for a project like this before the Kickstarter get launched?

250
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:37,500
Rym: Like how much of the game is already designed or written or concepted out before someone clicks like launch and Kickstarter?

251
00:11:39,301 --> 00:11:42,659
Guest 1: More work than you expect, no matter how much work you do.

252
00:11:43,923 --> 00:11:53,200
Guest 1: As the person who took it upon herself to write every word that you see in the Kickstarter, like on the Kickstarter page when you go to hustlecatgame.com.

253
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,198
Guest 1: Going to plug that again.

254
00:11:55,822 --> 00:11:57,980
Guest 1: It's a lot of work just to put the text together.

255
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:05,300
Guest 1: And then you realize that you need things like demos and assets and reasons to get people to buy a game.

256
00:12:05,501 --> 00:12:08,119
Guest 1: As it turns out, they won't do that without anything to look at.

257
00:12:08,642 --> 00:12:10,540
Rym: They will if it's a tabletop game, apparently.

258
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,940
Scott: Isn't that always sort of weird, though?

259
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,912
Scott: It wasn't the point of Kickstarter to be like, "Hey, I have an idea for something.

260
00:12:14,952 --> 00:12:15,735
Scott: I haven't done it yet.

261
00:12:15,815 --> 00:12:16,879
Scott: I need money in order to do

262
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:16,960
Scott: it.".

263
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,100
Scott: But the reality is you actually have to do a whole bunch of work for no money.

264
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,460
Scott: And if Kickstarter fails, then you can't do the thing at all and you just wasted a bunch of time.

265
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,379
Guest 1: I guess visual novels, I mean, you have two aspects just to the word.

266
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:32,760
Guest 1: You have to have visuals and you have to know what the story's about.

267
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:38,378
Guest 1: So you see a lot of visual novel Kickstarters and all they've got are, "These are the five cute characters.

268
00:12:38,398 --> 00:12:38,899
Guest 1: You'll get to

269
00:12:38,939 --> 00:12:39,100
Guest 1: smooch.".

270
00:12:39,722 --> 00:12:42,251
Guest 1: And it's usually like five hot dudes.

271
00:12:42,633 --> 00:12:43,697
Guest 1: Sometimes you are a dude.

272
00:12:43,737 --> 00:12:44,600
Guest 1: Sometimes you are a lady.

273
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:51,140
Guest 1: But usually for visual novels, you'll just see the five hot dudes and which members of the band they are.

274
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,020
Guest 1: And also, you're a high school girl who's very scared.

275
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:05,040
Rym: Because I've noticed that with tabletop Kickstarters and a lot of other kinds of game projects where people will kickstart their idea and they've literally done no actual work up to that point.

276
00:13:05,941 --> 00:13:08,313
Rym: And those games, people back them for some reason.

277
00:13:08,594 --> 00:13:09,900
Rym: But then the games are terrible.

278
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:18,160
Scott: It's so tough because on the one hand, I feel like you're trying to mitigate your risk of taking on a big project with no funding.

279
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,466
Scott: But all you've got is an idea to start with.

280
00:13:20,486 --> 00:13:24,940
Scott: You don't want to start doing work on something that you're not going to be able to fund and waste your time and effort.

281
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,880
Scott: So you want to start a Kickstarter with not a lot of work done.

282
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:35,160
Scott: But as someone who's going to kickstart something, why would I kickstart something if you haven't demonstrated to me that it's definitely going to happen?

283
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:43,760
Guest 1: Yeah, I guess all of my friends who are trying to make tabletop games have just workshopped it to death at Gen Con.

284
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:49,000
Guest 1: They've been working for years just tweaking the text and getting people to test play.

285
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:53,589
Guest 1: And like that, I think the effort pays off exponentially.

286
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:58,660
Guest 1: So the total goal for our Kickstarter is twenty five thousand.

287
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,397
Guest 1: We're way above average for asking price for visual novels.

288
00:14:02,437 --> 00:14:02,939
Guest 1: You'll see them.

289
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,989
Scott: But you have a proven track record.

290
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:07,020
Scott: You have succeeded in the past many times.

291
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,360
Guest 0: Yeah, we we we launched a game that we kickstarted and we did so within a year of the Kickstarter.

292
00:14:12,722 --> 00:14:14,836
Guest 0: And that is a point of pride for all of us.

293
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:23,580
Guest 0: You know, I couldn't and I mean, I will I will throw it to Joe here because, like, I would say she was responsible for ensuring that that happened.

294
00:14:24,761 --> 00:14:26,648
Guest 0: But, you know, I'm incredibly proud of that.

295
00:14:26,688 --> 00:14:29,318
Guest 0: And then we made we know the devil with AV in 10 to 12 weeks.

296
00:14:30,181 --> 00:14:30,502
Guest 0: Yeah.

297
00:14:30,522 --> 00:14:31,224
Guest 0: Top to bottom.

298
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:34,155
Guest 0: You know, we we we ship man.

299
00:14:34,275 --> 00:14:35,500
Guest 1: And it's a point of pride for me.

300
00:14:35,901 --> 00:14:37,532
Scott: Yeah, 12 weeks is crazy.

301
00:14:37,613 --> 00:14:38,116
Guest 0: It should be.

302
00:14:38,136 --> 00:14:38,499
Guest 0: Yeah.

303
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,985
Guest 1: And it just requires organization.

304
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:47,000
Guest 1: And like in terms of my job, it comes down to sending out an email a day saying, where's my stuff?

305
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,605
Guest 1: Why are people so mad at that?

306
00:14:49,685 --> 00:14:49,926
Rym: Why?

307
00:14:49,986 --> 00:14:55,740
Rym: It seems like one of the most important business skills in the world is can you read and respond to emails in a timely fashion?

308
00:14:56,122 --> 00:14:59,180
Rym: Like that gets you already above like four fifths of the population.

309
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,945
Guest 0: I'll tell you right now, I'm terrible at it.

310
00:15:03,329 --> 00:15:06,720
Guest 0: I know you are sitting next to me like it wouldn't get like she.

311
00:15:07,101 --> 00:15:12,900
Guest 0: You know, this this collaborative partnership between us, I think is is like just the dopest.

312
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,589
Guest 0: We're you know, we're moving so fast right now.

313
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:18,059
Guest 0: And it's it's only because Joe's here to wrangle all of us.

314
00:15:19,042 --> 00:15:20,207
Scott: Well, 12 weeks is insane, right?

315
00:15:20,589 --> 00:15:21,534
Guest 0: It was nuts, dude.

316
00:15:21,574 --> 00:15:22,358
Guest 0: I can't even tell you.

317
00:15:23,521 --> 00:15:25,752
Scott: Anyway, were you cheating and like working at night like you do?

318
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:26,456
Scott: Yes.

319
00:15:26,496 --> 00:15:27,280
Rym: He was working last night.

320
00:15:28,141 --> 00:15:33,920
Rym: So really, we went out drinking last night and then they're like, OK, we should go finish the work we're working on.

321
00:15:34,922 --> 00:15:36,004
Guest 0: I was up until two.

322
00:15:37,147 --> 00:15:42,820
Guest 0: We had to ship a. we had to ship a offline binary of the German translation of Starfighter Eclipse coming very soon.

323
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,084
Guest 0: It is integrated.

324
00:15:44,124 --> 00:15:44,386
Guest 0: Yeah.

325
00:15:44,406 --> 00:15:44,626
Guest 0: Yeah.

326
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:45,711
Guest 0: So that'll be up.

327
00:15:45,972 --> 00:15:46,293
Guest 0: God.

328
00:15:46,895 --> 00:15:47,598
Guest 0: Very, very soon.

329
00:15:47,638 --> 00:15:48,040
Guest 1: Very soon.

330
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,627
Rym: Are you going to be working tonight?

331
00:15:50,029 --> 00:15:50,452
Guest 1: Yes.

332
00:15:51,035 --> 00:15:51,337
Guest 0: Yeah.

333
00:15:52,741 --> 00:15:53,081
Guest 0: Yeah.

334
00:15:53,222 --> 00:15:53,904
Guest 0: You know, we have to do it.

335
00:15:54,064 --> 00:16:07,200
Guest 0: You know, for what it's worth, you know, running running a small like no business is profitable in its early years, like not a single one unless, you know, you're you're just doing insider trading and mad, mad investment scams, which we're not.

336
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,967
Guest 0: You know, we we're like an honest, legitimate company.

337
00:16:10,227 --> 00:16:15,060
Guest 0: We make and sell products, you know, and it's very difficult for small businesses in particular.

338
00:16:15,361 --> 00:16:21,320
Rym: And, you know, we're no exception, especially because you didn't take you didn't get like five million dollars in seed capital.

339
00:16:21,501 --> 00:16:24,500
Scott: Yes, a star, because honestly, you got to do with someone else.

340
00:16:24,821 --> 00:16:25,202
Scott: Exactly.

341
00:16:25,222 --> 00:16:32,920
Guest 0: I want to touch on this point, too, is the trend in in games and the way games get made, I find very disheartening.

342
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,149
Guest 0: I wanted to make games the way I wanted to make games.

343
00:16:36,189 --> 00:16:39,660
Guest 0: I wanted to bring a diverse crew on board to tell their stories.

344
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:47,560
Guest 0: And what I didn't want was, you know, some some Peter Thiel to come to my house and be like, oh, yeah, but like, can can you fuck these girls?

345
00:16:49,401 --> 00:16:50,847
Scott: Can you fuck them?

346
00:16:50,967 --> 00:16:53,959
Guest 0: Like, he's a West Coast VC.

347
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:54,160
Guest 0: Sorry.

348
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:57,220
Scott: OK, so I know who he is now.

349
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:04,999
Guest 1: But yeah, as a side note, Mountain Dew, if you want us to make a dating sim between six different Mountain Dew flavors and give us five million dollars.

350
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,067
Guest 0: We do take contract work.

351
00:17:07,107 --> 00:17:09,040
Guest 0: Don't get me wrong, but we will not dilute equity.

352
00:17:10,882 --> 00:17:12,090
Guest 0: We will take contract work, though.

353
00:17:12,111 --> 00:17:12,896
Guest 0: So so fancy.

354
00:17:12,935 --> 00:17:13,299
Guest 0: Get at me.

355
00:17:13,901 --> 00:17:19,936
Scott: Actually, a Mountain Dew dating sim would probably because I can just be all the beverages PepsiCo owns like a whole bunch of just be hard.

356
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,960
Rym: It was for Roger Rabbit to have Disney and Warner Brothers characters in it at the same time.

357
00:17:25,703 --> 00:17:26,347
Guest 0: So hard M&M's.

358
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:27,675
Guest 0: We're not even thinking about it.

359
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:28,300
Scott: Red and green.

360
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,303
Guest 1: Oh, no.

361
00:17:29,384 --> 00:17:29,987
Guest 1: Gross.

362
00:17:30,248 --> 00:17:30,731
Guest 1: Gross.

363
00:17:31,234 --> 00:17:31,555
Rym: You know what?

364
00:17:31,575 --> 00:17:32,219
Rym: I worry, actually.

365
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,368
Scott: Red goes away for the whole middle of the game.

366
00:17:35,608 --> 00:17:36,753
Rym: I don't care what you worry.

367
00:17:36,793 --> 00:17:38,460
Rym: I'm still thinking about M&M's fucking.

368
00:17:39,322 --> 00:17:39,623
Rym: What do they?

369
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:40,669
Rym: what do they crack them?

370
00:17:40,729 --> 00:17:42,720
Scott: Even M&M's makes that joke in their own commercials.

371
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:47,016
Scott: So, you know, that's not really much of a stretch to your hand, but not in your mouth.

372
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,528
Rym: There's a plot point where someone's colorblind.

373
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:50,393
Rym: They can't tell them apart.

374
00:17:50,996 --> 00:17:51,599
Rym: Oh, no.

375
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,926
Rym: But I also worry not not to rag on M&M's.

376
00:17:54,966 --> 00:17:55,167
Rym: I don't.

377
00:17:55,207 --> 00:18:01,200
Rym: But I imagine there are properties like M&M's where the people would say things like, oh, no, no, can't be gay.

378
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,164
Rym: Oh, no, they can't.

379
00:18:02,205 --> 00:18:05,020
Rym: Those two can't date because Lego wouldn't allow this.

380
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:05,541
Guest 0: Yeah.

381
00:18:05,861 --> 00:18:08,005
Guest 0: And this is exactly the kind of stuff that I want to avoid.

382
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:12,672
Guest 0: Like, I want to avoid that kind of investor influence where it's like, well, you know, well, we don't.

383
00:18:12,712 --> 00:18:17,560
Guest 0: we don't think this demo wants to see like this kind of presentation or this kind of inclusion.

384
00:18:17,921 --> 00:18:18,222
Guest 0: And I got.

385
00:18:18,282 --> 00:18:19,566
Guest 0: no I got no time for that shit.

386
00:18:19,747 --> 00:18:23,340
Guest 0: Like, if I'm going to if I'm going to make this company succeed, I'm going to do it on my own terms.

387
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,919
Guest 0: And, you know, that that's just how it is.

388
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:36,180
Scott: I wonder if instead of contract, like getting a contract from someone like they're paying you basically to make an advertisement for them to do the reverse deal where you buy a license to a property and use it.

389
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:36,481
Scott: Right.

390
00:18:36,501 --> 00:18:40,720
Scott: The same way that, like, IDW buys the license to make My Little Pony comics.

391
00:18:41,502 --> 00:18:44,353
Guest 0: It can be hard because that does require a significant upfront investment.

392
00:18:44,393 --> 00:18:46,340
Guest 0: We've explored this kind of opportunity before.

393
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:58,140
Guest 0: We, you know, are definitely open to doing partnership stuff where rather than like buying a property and and, you know, something of that nature, there's like a severe back end split or something like that.

394
00:18:58,401 --> 00:19:00,279
Guest 0: That's the kind of stuff we would take on in a heartbeat, you know?

395
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:07,800
Rym: Yeah, I guess it is because I mean, I way back, I at least started looking to getting licenses to some anime for things just to see like what it would cost.

396
00:19:08,582 --> 00:19:10,360
Rym: And yeah, that is not feasible.

397
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,740
Scott: You negotiate, obviously.

398
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:22,140
Rym: But no, it is not feasible, even if you've got money for a lot of properties, because it's there's a there's cash upfront and heavy restrictions, at least from what I could gather.

399
00:19:22,522 --> 00:19:24,860
Rym: And this is for like unknown properties.

400
00:19:25,782 --> 00:19:25,983
Scott: All right.

401
00:19:26,003 --> 00:19:29,660
Scott: So ostensibly, Ram, you wanted to do this as a profiling geek.

402
00:19:30,201 --> 00:19:32,520
Scott: We've never had just so they're game the whole time.

403
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,188
Guest 1: Yeah, exactly.

404
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,000
Rym: But this is fun.

405
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:40,540
Rym: But John, so this person you are making these projects, but what's the real you like?

406
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:46,740
Rym: So I got to know what are three anime that you like and watched and would watch again?

407
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:47,684
Guest 1: Oh, my God.

408
00:19:48,309 --> 00:19:49,800
Guest 1: That is an incredibly tough question.

409
00:19:50,161 --> 00:19:51,332
Scott: Because we know you like anime.

410
00:19:51,352 --> 00:19:52,139
Scott: We didn't ask that question.

411
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,383
Rym: But we used to like.

412
00:19:53,403 --> 00:19:55,433
Rym: you can't ask the question, like, what's your favorite movie?

413
00:19:55,473 --> 00:19:56,940
Rym: Because then, like, it's hard for people to narrow it down.

414
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,475
Rym: It's like, what are three?

415
00:19:58,637 --> 00:19:58,920
Guest 1: All right.

416
00:19:59,461 --> 00:20:01,799
Rym: For me, it's like Utena, Cowboy Bebop, Escaflowne.

417
00:20:02,663 --> 00:20:03,915
Guest 1: OK, off the top of my head.

418
00:20:05,021 --> 00:20:06,519
Guest 1: I grew up watching Fushigi Yugi.

419
00:20:06,842 --> 00:20:08,279
Guest 1: Oh, I'll never let it go.

420
00:20:08,804 --> 00:20:09,471
Guest 1: I'll never let it go.

421
00:20:09,693 --> 00:20:10,117
Rym: That was all.

422
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:16,180
Rym: That might have been one of the first anime that did the thing where the theme song comes in before the end of the episode.

423
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,680
Rym: Sometimes really sad shit.

424
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,067
Scott: The alien nine thing.

425
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:21,518
Rym: Oh, that's the other thing.

426
00:20:21,598 --> 00:20:21,820
Rym: Right.

427
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:22,462
Scott: OK.

428
00:20:23,268 --> 00:20:24,799
Guest 1: Number two around host club.

429
00:20:25,542 --> 00:20:26,226
Guest 1: Hands down.

430
00:20:26,971 --> 00:20:28,420
Guest 1: And I'll go past year.

431
00:20:28,621 --> 00:20:29,932
Guest 1: I've watched Gachamon Crowds.

432
00:20:30,254 --> 00:20:30,899
Guest 1: Still love it.

433
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,849
Guest 1: We started before we started recording.

434
00:20:32,889 --> 00:20:34,920
Guest 1: We had a little conversation about Gachamon Crowd.

435
00:20:35,503 --> 00:20:38,580
Guest 1: It's just it's cute and it's it's optimistic.

436
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:47,480
Guest 1: And I like that, like some anime, they'll do like a midseason spin and get really grim, like Hajime from Gachamon Crowds.

437
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,080
Guest 1: She stays really upbeat no matter what happens.

438
00:20:50,381 --> 00:20:58,100
Guest 1: She doesn't have that moment like that anime heroine anxiety moment that Utena has, for instance, where she's like, what if I can't do this?

439
00:20:58,541 --> 00:20:59,465
Guest 1: I quit.

440
00:20:59,746 --> 00:21:03,720
Guest 1: And then half an episode later, she's like, wait, that's why I'm doing it.

441
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:05,185
Guest 1: I reverse quit.

442
00:21:05,205 --> 00:21:06,310
Guest 1: Yeah.

443
00:21:06,631 --> 00:21:08,859
Guest 1: Now I can fight all these monsters again.

444
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:17,600
Guest 1: Hajime is consistently believes that she and her team can fight all the monsters, even when the stakes are super duper bad.

445
00:21:18,722 --> 00:21:19,225
Rym: All right.

446
00:21:19,687 --> 00:21:21,234
Scott: So same question games.

447
00:21:21,897 --> 00:21:22,440
Guest 1: Oh, gosh.

448
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,301
Guest 1: OK, I can.

449
00:21:23,542 --> 00:21:32,560
Guest 1: I can barely even narrow down three games in the past year because we've blown through the campaign for lovers in a dangerous space time.

450
00:21:34,827 --> 00:21:38,740
Scott: My friends are going to the Netrunner World Championships and one of them doesn't like to fly.

451
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,800
Scott: So they're taking the train and he's like, Scott, can I can I borrow a controller?

452
00:21:43,161 --> 00:21:46,159
Scott: You can show the brain so we can play the game on the train.

453
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:47,183
Guest 1: Oh, my gosh.

454
00:21:47,283 --> 00:21:48,266
Guest 1: It's incredible.

455
00:21:48,527 --> 00:21:52,560
Guest 1: And the best thing is, like we listen to Polygon's quality control podcast.

456
00:21:53,241 --> 00:21:57,700
Guest 1: And Griffin McElroy was like, look, this game is incredibly hard.

457
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,668
Guest 1: You have to be a good gamer to play this.

458
00:21:59,929 --> 00:22:02,520
Guest 1: And I looked over at Conrad and I was like, I'm a good gamer.

459
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,442
Guest 1: Did you know?

460
00:22:03,462 --> 00:22:05,568
Guest 1: Because neither of us did.

461
00:22:05,608 --> 00:22:09,620
Guest 0: Apparently, I knew she's better than me at Gears and Halo.

462
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,347
Guest 1: Two dropsy the clown.

463
00:22:13,367 --> 00:22:14,916
Scott: I don't even know what that is.

464
00:22:14,936 --> 00:22:15,620
Scott: Tell me about that.

465
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:21,220
Guest 1: I dig a point and click adventure game, but I tried playing the release of groom Fandango.

466
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,911
Guest 1: It was just so old and so slow.

467
00:22:25,372 --> 00:22:29,504
Guest 1: dropsy the clown kind of hits that sweet spot, that machinarium hit.

468
00:22:29,544 --> 00:22:33,840
Guest 1: for me where you solve these like very enclosed, perfect puzzles.

469
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,544
Guest 1: The art is cute.

470
00:22:35,664 --> 00:22:40,600
Guest 1: The the creator of the game, I think comes from like something awful stock.

471
00:22:40,781 --> 00:22:45,640
Guest 1: So the humor is very gonzo, but also like a little bit sweet.

472
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:52,480
Guest 1: Like it's about a clown who was was raised by like a normal human dude.

473
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,320
Guest 1: Think like Superman, George and Martha Kent.

474
00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:02,860
Guest 1: And and he gets accused of starting a fire that kills his mom.

475
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:10,120
Guest 1: And so he has to go around town, his town, helping people out with their problems to redeem his character.

476
00:23:10,843 --> 00:23:13,660
Guest 1: And one of the actions you can always take is hug.

477
00:23:14,042 --> 00:23:15,813
Guest 1: You can hug a tree to make it happy.

478
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:16,920
Guest 1: You can hug a squirrel.

479
00:23:17,421 --> 00:23:20,614
Guest 1: You you hug various things to solve various problems.

480
00:23:20,674 --> 00:23:22,100
Rym: And the hug ever go badly.

481
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:22,703
Guest 1: Oh, yes.

482
00:23:22,844 --> 00:23:24,720
Guest 1: The hug can go badly like cactus.

483
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:32,320
Guest 1: Like if you don't solve someone's problem and try to hug them, they yell at you in a truly devastating fashion.

484
00:23:33,021 --> 00:23:34,508
Guest 0: There's also no words in the game.

485
00:23:34,689 --> 00:23:37,180
Guest 0: It's all pictograms and gestures, which I thought was very cool.

486
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:37,700
Guest 1: Yeah.

487
00:23:37,861 --> 00:23:42,680
Guest 1: But like and even though there's no words, there's like limited kind of sound effects of voice acting.

488
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:46,011
Guest 1: So you can tell audibly when someone's mad at you.

489
00:23:46,372 --> 00:23:46,793
Scott: How do I get?

490
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:48,057
Scott: this game is on steam or whatever.

491
00:23:48,077 --> 00:23:48,840
Guest 1: it is on steam.

492
00:23:49,522 --> 00:23:49,844
Guest 1: Yeah.

493
00:23:50,306 --> 00:23:51,935
Guest 1: And you can buy it from the guy.

494
00:23:51,955 --> 00:23:52,760
Guest 1: You can tweet at him.

495
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:53,863
Guest 1: He's super cool.

496
00:23:54,064 --> 00:23:55,930
Guest 1: And like the game is just great.

497
00:23:56,211 --> 00:23:58,900
Guest 1: You know, you don't really need a guide to help you.

498
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:06,160
Guest 1: And I think the difference between like new school and old school point and click adventures is that the old school adventures would give you a stopping point.

499
00:24:06,821 --> 00:24:10,220
Guest 1: And if you couldn't solve this puzzle, you just couldn't keep going in the game.

500
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:18,440
Guest 1: Like I'm thinking of the first hour of Grim Fandango, where if you don't have bread to help the balloon animal guy, you just can't proceed.

501
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,447
Guest 1: But Dropsy has this huge map.

502
00:24:21,788 --> 00:24:26,080
Guest 1: And if you get stuck at a point, you can just go and solve someone else's problem for a moment.

503
00:24:26,581 --> 00:24:27,905
Guest 1: And then it makes you feel good.

504
00:24:27,945 --> 00:24:33,040
Guest 1: And there are big, like longer puzzles to solve and very short, discrete puzzles to solve.

505
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,978
Guest 1: And you always feel great when you when you figure it out.

506
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:36,701
Rym: It's interesting.

507
00:24:36,721 --> 00:24:43,160
Rym: That's an aspect that when you think about all the adventure games, like a lot of the ones that are really popular were just a linear plot through a story of click to make it continue.

508
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,828
Rym: But then there's the few like some of the king's quest, but not many of them.

509
00:24:46,169 --> 00:24:49,500
Rym: The quest for glories that had that more open world wander around.

510
00:24:49,941 --> 00:24:53,959
Scott: I've tried to play some point and click adventures in recent years, but mostly like LucasArtsy ones.

511
00:24:54,019 --> 00:24:54,200
Scott: Right.

512
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,950
Scott: And I just got faxed from the Internet because I'm like, screw this nonsense.

513
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:59,440
Scott: Anything I don't remember from my childhood, I don't have time for this.

514
00:24:59,660 --> 00:24:59,960
Scott: Right.

515
00:25:00,181 --> 00:25:01,902
Guest 1: I just remember the most sounds good.

516
00:25:02,182 --> 00:25:22,120
Guest 1: The most frustrating point for me as a point and click adventure enthusiast was playing the longest journey and having to suffer through the travel time of going into the police department, getting a can of soda and then actually having to go 15 minutes through various screens in the game to go to a paint can shaker.

517
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:32,798
Guest 1: So you could shake up the soda in a paint can shaker, go back to the police department and give it to a cop just so he busts open like a foamy soda can.

518
00:25:33,218 --> 00:25:34,020
Guest 1: It was infuriating.

519
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,700
Rym: Police Quest, you had to actually get in the car and know your way around town.

520
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,520
Scott: You had to go in the elevator, push the know which floor to go to to go to your office.

521
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:50,080
Guest 0: I'm not trying to put you on blast here, but you can't venerate Quest for Glory to and then complain about maze traversal and police.

522
00:25:51,681 --> 00:25:54,347
Rym: But at least in Quest for Glory to why?

523
00:25:54,367 --> 00:25:59,400
Rym: I mean, it was the DRM of the day, like that maze was unsolvable unless you had the physical map.

524
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,866
Rym: That's how they did DRM to the game.

525
00:26:01,886 --> 00:26:02,568
Rym: Did a turnabout.

526
00:26:02,588 --> 00:26:07,540
Rym: because if you play Quest for Glory through to the end, there's a point where you're because once you get somewhere, you can just click and get there.

527
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,324
Rym: You don't have to ever like go in the mazes again.

528
00:26:09,846 --> 00:26:15,620
Rym: But later in the game, something happens and you click to go somewhere and suddenly the game shows you in the middle of the maze.

529
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,162
Rym: You're like, what?

530
00:26:16,584 --> 00:26:18,311
Rym: And then there's stuff going on.

531
00:26:18,753 --> 00:26:19,175
Guest 0: That was cool.

532
00:26:19,195 --> 00:26:19,516
Guest 0: All right.

533
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:20,380
Guest 0: Yeah, that was dope.

534
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,186
Rym: Quest for Glory 2 had its problems.

535
00:26:22,387 --> 00:26:23,453
Rym: Yeah, but it was awesome.

536
00:26:23,553 --> 00:26:24,036
Rym: It was the best.

537
00:26:24,136 --> 00:26:24,619
Rym: It was so good.

538
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,505
Rym: Those games are more like staff builders, though.

539
00:26:26,525 --> 00:26:28,593
Rym: There was a lot of game going on.

540
00:26:28,693 --> 00:26:28,934
Guest 0: Yeah.

541
00:26:28,994 --> 00:26:30,480
Guest 0: And I think I could only play them when I was young.

542
00:26:30,861 --> 00:26:32,084
Rym: I could play them again, too.

543
00:26:32,285 --> 00:26:32,947
Rym: I could play again.

544
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:37,319
Guest 1: I think I'm still on the hook for one game, so I'm going to plug Black Closet.

545
00:26:38,461 --> 00:26:42,872
Guest 1: It's the new game by the team that did Long Live the Queen, which is the staff builder game.

546
00:26:43,073 --> 00:26:44,116
Scott: Long Live the Queen was good.

547
00:26:44,296 --> 00:26:45,800
Guest 1: And it is fantastic.

548
00:26:46,701 --> 00:26:49,587
Guest 1: It's very like in the mood, Utena-esque.

549
00:26:49,747 --> 00:26:56,000
Guest 1: You play the president of the student council of kind of like a fake world girls academy.

550
00:26:56,321 --> 00:26:57,607
Rym: So am I a guy or girl?

551
00:26:57,668 --> 00:26:58,090
Rym: is the matter?

552
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:58,592
Rym: Am I a girl?

553
00:26:58,612 --> 00:26:59,175
Guest 1: You are a girl.

554
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,239
Guest 1: You're definitely a girl.

555
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:06,820
Guest 1: And you have to save the reputation of your school and the reputation of the student council.

556
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:15,360
Guest 1: And like various small scale problems happen and you have to send your minions to go solve the problems for you.

557
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,024
Rym: So you're Nanami.

558
00:27:17,245 --> 00:27:17,907
Guest 1: Yeah.

559
00:27:18,288 --> 00:27:22,440
Guest 1: So your minions have various stats and you use them to different effects.

560
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:30,899
Guest 1: So sometimes you question a girl who you think stole like another girl's homework and then the girl seems suspicious.

561
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:36,233
Guest 1: And after that, you can harass her or you can stalk her and see what she's up to.

562
00:27:36,273 --> 00:27:38,880
Guest 1: But if you get caught, the consequences hurt.

563
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,527
Guest 1: Like they burn the student council's reputation.

564
00:27:41,547 --> 00:27:42,912
Scott: You're not actually stalking a minion.

565
00:27:42,972 --> 00:27:45,640
Scott: is stalking a minion and coming back to you with information.

566
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,041
Scott: Yeah.

567
00:27:46,242 --> 00:27:48,088
Guest 1: Or or failing horribly.

568
00:27:48,168 --> 00:27:52,080
Guest 1: The whole thing works off of a series of stats and then d 20 dice rolls.

569
00:27:52,581 --> 00:27:57,080
Guest 1: It feels very satisfying when you win and it feels very devastating when you lose.

570
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:57,783
Scott: So it's so.

571
00:27:57,823 --> 00:27:59,111
Scott: it's got more randomness than long.

572
00:27:59,151 --> 00:28:00,520
Scott: live the queen because you live the queen.

573
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,871
Scott: It was like if your stat is up to here, you're going to succeed.

574
00:28:02,891 --> 00:28:04,740
Scott: And if it's not, you're not pretty much right.

575
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:05,120
Guest 1: Yeah.

576
00:28:05,161 --> 00:28:09,334
Guest 1: So it has a little element of randomness and then you can also like.

577
00:28:09,434 --> 00:28:11,280
Guest 1: it has a bit of an RPG element, too.

578
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:11,903
Guest 1: So you can.

579
00:28:12,165 --> 00:28:14,820
Guest 1: you can level up your minions very, very slowly.

580
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,005
Guest 1: So you have to be very deliberate.

581
00:28:17,426 --> 00:28:27,400
Guest 1: I've heard from a couple of people that it takes like at least three runs before you feel super comfortable with, you know, how you're managing your team and how you go about solving the various crimes.

582
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:34,440
Guest 1: It's amazing, though, the experience of playing it is just so satisfying that I could be into that.

583
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,939
Rym: You could be like, what's your name in Yurikuma managing the invisible storm?

584
00:28:39,322 --> 00:28:39,563
Scott: All right.

585
00:28:39,583 --> 00:28:40,910
Scott: So obviously you're a nerdy person.

586
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,880
Scott: No one on the show would not be a nerdy person.

587
00:28:43,584 --> 00:28:46,060
Scott: What are you into that is not nerdy or unexpected?

588
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,905
Guest 1: I collect handbags.

589
00:28:49,286 --> 00:28:49,728
Guest 1: There you go.

590
00:28:49,788 --> 00:28:52,740
Guest 1: I collect brand name handbags and like the really expensive ones.

591
00:28:52,940 --> 00:29:00,000
Guest 1: Not the really super expensive ones, but my handbag collection is more expensive than my clothes and shoes collection.

592
00:29:01,387 --> 00:29:01,830
Guest 1: Oh, gosh.

593
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:03,240
Guest 1: It made me more expensive than my Pokemon collection.

594
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,840
Rym: Do you lock them up in Lucite and protect them for future generations?

595
00:29:06,621 --> 00:29:08,188
Scott: No, I use them to carry things.

596
00:29:08,248 --> 00:29:09,715
Guest 1: Yes, I use them to carry things.

597
00:29:09,796 --> 00:29:10,740
Guest 1: I get them super messy.

598
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,345
Guest 1: I spilled drinks in them.

599
00:29:12,365 --> 00:29:17,000
Guest 1: I spilled a beer on myself right before we started recording.

600
00:29:17,981 --> 00:29:20,660
Scott: Do you care about like the bootleg ones or is it got to be legit?

601
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:27,300
Guest 1: You know, it feels better if it's legit and mid range than if it's bootleg and like high scale.

602
00:29:27,701 --> 00:29:30,900
Guest 1: Though I have been told I'm for the record, I'm Taiwanese.

603
00:29:31,621 --> 00:29:36,300
Guest 1: And my family insists that if I ever want to visit, I don't have to pay for a plane ticket.

604
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:43,200
Guest 1: I should just send them a bunch of coach bags and they'll sell them on the street for three times the price to pay for my airfare.

605
00:29:43,461 --> 00:29:43,782
Guest 1: Wow.

606
00:29:43,822 --> 00:29:45,751
Guest 1: Maybe that's where the legacy comes from away.

607
00:29:45,792 --> 00:29:47,460
Scott: So you could just buy legitimate ones.

608
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:47,940
Scott: Right.

609
00:29:47,961 --> 00:29:50,329
Guest 1: The legitimate price, like at outlet stores.

610
00:29:50,691 --> 00:29:50,891
Guest 1: Right.

611
00:29:50,911 --> 00:29:53,160
Guest 1: And then would sell legally by real ones.

612
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:53,462
Scott: Right.

613
00:29:53,603 --> 00:29:56,040
Scott: But they'll resell over there for more money than you pay.

614
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:59,839
Guest 1: An Abercrombie and Fitch T-shirt will sell for one hundred dollars.

615
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,470
Scott: But customs won't stop you.

616
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:02,418
Scott: Send bring these over.

617
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,166
Guest 1: They might.

618
00:30:04,206 --> 00:30:05,474
Rym: T-shirt might be easier.

619
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,163
Rym: But yeah, it's tough.

620
00:30:07,183 --> 00:30:10,057
Scott: I mean, you know, guys don't really need this Kickstarter action if you got the side job.

621
00:30:11,701 --> 00:30:12,765
Guest 0: We want to get out of.

622
00:30:12,825 --> 00:30:17,380
Guest 0: you know, we've sold bags on Canal Street for a long time.

623
00:30:18,281 --> 00:30:19,728
Guest 0: We're looking to move uptown.

624
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:20,814
Scott: So what is like?

625
00:30:20,894 --> 00:30:21,960
Scott: so, you know, you have this big head.

626
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:25,980
Scott: What are like your favorite handbags like the, you know, the ones you like to use the most often?

627
00:30:26,582 --> 00:30:29,099
Guest 1: OK, so so this is where the nerd stuff comes back in.

628
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,908
Rym: You got to be a nerd.

629
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:33,340
Scott: And what makes these ones better than the other ones?

630
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:38,620
Guest 1: I measure everyone by how precisely my current devices fit into them.

631
00:30:39,261 --> 00:30:48,040
Guest 1: So I have a Marc Jacobs bag that I bought entirely because my my MacBook Air 11 inch fits perfectly inside the slot.

632
00:30:48,541 --> 00:30:50,328
Guest 1: No, no extra space.

633
00:30:51,413 --> 00:30:53,260
Guest 1: My my current like little backpack.

634
00:30:53,621 --> 00:31:00,140
Guest 1: Same reason I have like an iPad mini that and I have several handbags that perfectly fit it.

635
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:05,160
Rym: So if you buy a new iPhone and it's a different form factor, does that change the ranking?

636
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,785
Guest 1: Yes, absolutely.

637
00:31:07,106 --> 00:31:08,855
Guest 1: Oh, no, absolutely.

638
00:31:08,955 --> 00:31:10,020
Guest 1: I get different bags.

639
00:31:10,121 --> 00:31:10,603
Guest 1: They have to.

640
00:31:10,804 --> 00:31:12,312
Guest 1: I have to size out the pockets.

641
00:31:12,493 --> 00:31:13,780
Guest 1: It gets really insane.

642
00:31:13,901 --> 00:31:16,300
Guest 1: And that's probably why the collection is so big.

643
00:31:16,861 --> 00:31:18,427
Scott: Is there like a bag community you're in?

644
00:31:18,507 --> 00:31:21,919
Scott: It's like trading or like forums online where the bag people hang out.

645
00:31:22,262 --> 00:31:23,715
Guest 1: I suffer with my own shame.

646
00:31:23,735 --> 00:31:24,078
Guest 1: OK.

647
00:31:25,622 --> 00:31:26,267
Rym: That's not shame.

648
00:31:26,307 --> 00:31:27,275
Guest 1: That's that's a nerdy thing.

649
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,006
Rym: So what's the worst one?

650
00:31:29,026 --> 00:31:30,920
Rym: You feel like you have one that just like really sucks.

651
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:31,882
Rym: Yeah.

652
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:32,708
Rym: Bad handbag.

653
00:31:32,769 --> 00:31:33,071
Scott: Yeah.

654
00:31:33,111 --> 00:31:33,333
Scott: Yeah.

655
00:31:33,434 --> 00:31:34,240
Guest 1: It's hard to open.

656
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,363
Guest 1: It's really stiff.

657
00:31:35,543 --> 00:31:40,140
Guest 1: It sits weird on my shoulder and kind of hurts my skin sometimes when I wear a tank top.

658
00:31:40,281 --> 00:31:41,892
Guest 1: So, yeah, no, that one's rough.

659
00:31:42,174 --> 00:31:42,959
Guest 1: Try before you buy.

660
00:31:45,641 --> 00:31:56,640
Rym: So in terms of regular old American TV and movies, or at least American ish, like what's a good movie you've seen recently that you would advocate other people seeing?

661
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,905
Guest 1: Am I allowed to say Mad Max Fury?

662
00:31:59,046 --> 00:32:03,020
Rym: I was assuming you were going to say that because no movie has been better than that since that came out.

663
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,264
Guest 1: No, absolutely.

664
00:32:04,364 --> 00:32:08,839
Guest 1: And I will say all of my favorite movies this year have involved Fury in some way.

665
00:32:10,301 --> 00:32:12,408
Guest 1: Mad Max Fury Road, Furious seven.

666
00:32:12,428 --> 00:32:14,574
Guest 1: I cried like a baby.

667
00:32:14,595 --> 00:32:16,320
Rym: Well, because it got all sad and real.

668
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:16,640
Rym: I heard.

669
00:32:16,921 --> 00:32:17,782
Guest 1: Oh, super.

670
00:32:17,843 --> 00:32:18,884
Guest 1: It was super real.

671
00:32:18,985 --> 00:32:27,060
Guest 1: And if you've if you've watched them from the very beginning and I did a marathon, you know, one through seven, including Tokyo Drift.

672
00:32:28,661 --> 00:32:35,620
Guest 1: And man, that build up the way they dealt with Paul Walker's unfortunate death, like just incredible.

673
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:38,887
Guest 1: Of course, Mad Max Fury Road.

674
00:32:38,987 --> 00:32:39,328
Rym: I died.

675
00:32:39,368 --> 00:32:39,950
Rym: Not the actor.

676
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,615
Guest 1: Yeah, no, not the character.

677
00:32:41,635 --> 00:32:42,257
Rym: The actor died.

678
00:32:42,277 --> 00:32:43,120
Rym: The human died.

679
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,151
Scott: That shows that I know the human is dead.

680
00:32:45,432 --> 00:32:46,318
Guest 0: Very sad, actually.

681
00:32:46,358 --> 00:32:46,660
Guest 0: Good guy.

682
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:50,951
Guest 1: And gosh, Inside Out comes out on DVD next week.

683
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:54,100
Guest 1: I've had it preordered since the day that I watched it.

684
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,184
Rym: I only saw it recently.

685
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:58,680
Rym: I was on a plane and I watched Mad Max one and then I watched Inside Out.

686
00:32:59,501 --> 00:33:01,828
Guest 1: And man, Inside Out is just beautiful.

687
00:33:01,948 --> 00:33:05,540
Guest 1: Like they perfectly cast Lewis Black as the angry one.

688
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,587
Rym: What if they just like handcuff?

689
00:33:08,647 --> 00:33:09,590
Scott: What if they just handcuff?

690
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:13,200
Rym: sadness, though, instead of messing everything up and getting shot away?

691
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:17,720
Guest 1: Oh, then we wouldn't learn totally important lessons about pubescence.

692
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:20,819
Rym: Yeah, but she might have worked like the initial problem might have worked out OK.

693
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,815
Guest 0: Also, is that is that just what you do with people who tinker with stuff?

694
00:33:23,855 --> 00:33:24,680
Guest 0: You put them in handcuffs?

695
00:33:25,383 --> 00:33:25,665
Rym: Mr.

696
00:33:25,725 --> 00:33:27,795
Guest 0: Jailbreak, Jailbreak, Android phone.

697
00:33:27,855 --> 00:33:28,940
Guest 0: Is that the plan now, dog?

698
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:34,439
Rym: Well, it's a Sony phone, so measures need to be taken.

699
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:40,240
Rym: No, I'm trying to convince Scott to watch Mad Max because he hasn't seen it yet.

700
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:43,700
Rym: He doesn't realize that it is better than every other Mad Max movie combined.

701
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:50,220
Guest 1: Oh, man, I just watched Beyond the Thunderdome with an actually Conrad Kraling's mom.

702
00:33:51,982 --> 00:33:54,071
Rym: We got we got us about Conrad's mom.

703
00:33:54,091 --> 00:33:56,140
Guest 1: Yeah, we got wine drunk.

704
00:33:56,902 --> 00:33:57,686
Guest 1: I shit you not.

705
00:33:57,786 --> 00:34:00,500
Guest 1: Her name is actually Sigrid Kraling.

706
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,628
Guest 1: Her father is actually Siegfried.

707
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:07,620
Rym: And those are those are one giant sword.

708
00:34:08,462 --> 00:34:10,274
Scott: Is it like really like bigger, taller than he is?

709
00:34:10,293 --> 00:34:11,100
Guest 0: I wish, man.

710
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:12,958
Guest 0: If you if you know where that is, please let me know.

711
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:16,339
Rym: Siegfried wielded the ring and turned into a dragon.

712
00:34:16,906 --> 00:34:18,059
Scott: I'm talking about Soul Calibur.

713
00:34:20,103 --> 00:34:21,440
Scott: We're talking about the actual Siegfried.

714
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:22,998
Rym: Of the actual Siegfried?

715
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:29,060
Scott: I'm talking about the guy who hits you twice over the head and then flips you on your back with the sword in the nuts.

716
00:34:29,741 --> 00:34:31,620
Rym: I was talking about the historical Siegfried.

717
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,748
Guest 1: I'm sorry, boss.

718
00:34:32,768 --> 00:34:34,000
Guest 1: Some of us played Cassandra.

719
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,764
Guest 1: It's not the size of the sword.

720
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:39,340
Guest 1: It's how you I guess how you hip bump a person off a map.

721
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:43,478
Rym: So fun fact, apparently, like I'm really good at Soul Calibur, at least two.

722
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,139
Rym: I didn't really play once after that.

723
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:46,069
Rym: But I'm good.

724
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:50,839
Scott: I'll find someone who's actually pro and you will just not even hit them once.

725
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,179
Rym: Well, yeah, I actually could talk about like among us.

726
00:34:53,862 --> 00:34:55,139
Rym: I'm good at Voldo somehow.

727
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,800
Scott: You're better at Voldo than any other character.

728
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:00,860
Rym: Like, I don't know how Voldo just synced with me and that's disturbing.

729
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:06,178
Guest 1: Yeah, that's because fighting games, the gimp is so terrifying that people just concede to you.

730
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,705
Guest 0: Also, Rym, you got some.

731
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:11,180
Guest 0: I saw your bedroom door was cracked open earlier.

732
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,339
Guest 0: You got some shit in there, man.

733
00:35:12,561 --> 00:35:14,131
Rym: Like, I'm not surprised.

734
00:35:14,393 --> 00:35:15,460
Guest 0: I think you're channeling.

735
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:16,769
Scott: Those bunnies.

736
00:35:16,951 --> 00:35:17,579
Rym: Yeah, wow.

737
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:23,200
Rym: Well, they've got some apple treats that our friend Kat got them for a gift and they're into those things.

738
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,920
Rym: So they'll grab them and run away with them and hide them somewhere.

739
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:30,700
Rym: But then they see me looking and they run over and get it out of the place that they think I saw it in and hide it somewhere else.

740
00:35:31,381 --> 00:35:33,400
Rym: But they're rabid so I can just see where they're hiding it again.

741
00:35:33,541 --> 00:35:35,979
Rym: So it's not like like they think they're tricking me, I think.

742
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:41,080
Scott: Maybe there is something hidden that they've actually got a good spot and you don't know that spot because they hid it when you weren't looking.

743
00:35:41,201 --> 00:35:45,300
Rym: It's like when I played a wreck boy and I found all those blocks behind his little trash can or whatever.

744
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,920
Scott: You guys get any pet action over there in Brooklyn?

745
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:48,722
Guest 1: I have.

746
00:35:48,923 --> 00:35:50,270
Guest 1: well, I have two cats.

747
00:35:50,572 --> 00:35:52,020
Guest 1: They're the world's greatest cats.

748
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,158
Scott: They transform into boys.

749
00:35:54,481 --> 00:35:58,020
Guest 1: Gosh, I'm so glad they don't because they're super sloppy and awful.

750
00:35:58,841 --> 00:36:02,720
Guest 1: No, they they're I have the most dog like cats you'll ever see.

751
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,089
Guest 1: They greet me at the door.

752
00:36:04,129 --> 00:36:05,319
Guest 1: They chase me around the house.

753
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:07,045
Guest 1: One of them plays fetch.

754
00:36:07,145 --> 00:36:10,880
Guest 1: They're named Quinn for Harley Quinn and Frank for Frank Castle.

755
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:18,120
Guest 1: Frank Frank Castle canonical Marvel multiverse character Frank Castle.

756
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,540
Rym: Oh, that's the because that's where the all the other animals.

757
00:36:21,781 --> 00:36:22,973
Guest 1: Yeah, yeah.

758
00:36:23,034 --> 00:36:23,519
Guest 1: Peter Parker.

759
00:36:24,221 --> 00:36:26,051
Rym: OK, I learned about that recently.

760
00:36:26,091 --> 00:36:27,680
Rym: I was saving that to be a thing of the day.

761
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:28,509
Rym: I didn't know that was real.

762
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:29,460
Rym: I didn't know that was real.

763
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,439
Rym: I thought it was something someone made up because it's.

764
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,588
Scott: Yeah, someone did make it up.

765
00:36:32,609 --> 00:36:33,577
Scott: You know, Marvel made it up.

766
00:36:33,981 --> 00:36:35,520
Rym: I'm talking about the historic anyway.

767
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:37,619
Scott: It's old spider has been around a long time.

768
00:36:37,861 --> 00:36:38,649
Guest 1: Yeah, I'm

769
00:36:38,669 --> 00:36:39,235
Scott: so angry

770
00:36:39,275 --> 00:36:39,599
Guest 0: right now.

771
00:36:40,062 --> 00:36:42,212
Scott: Are you angry at Spider-Ham?

772
00:36:42,473 --> 00:36:43,498
Guest 1: Yeah, that's that.

773
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,946
Guest 1: I should be angry.

774
00:36:45,007 --> 00:36:46,014
Guest 0: We should all be angry.

775
00:36:46,034 --> 00:36:46,740
Guest 1: Peter Parker.

776
00:36:47,021 --> 00:36:48,680
Guest 1: Spider-Ham writes itself.

777
00:36:49,061 --> 00:36:51,080
Guest 0: We should all be angry at the existence of Peter.

778
00:36:51,281 --> 00:36:52,551
Guest 1: I saw it's hilarious.

779
00:36:52,591 --> 00:36:53,700
Rym: I saw the Howard deduct movie.

780
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,417
Rym: So nothing like second only to Squirrel Girl.

781
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,068
Rym: Squirrel Girl is pretty cool.

782
00:36:57,088 --> 00:36:58,198
Guest 0: Squirrel Girl is dope.

783
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,133
Rym: Yeah, the new the newer comics.

784
00:37:01,154 --> 00:37:02,240
Scott: The Ryan North Squirrel Girl.

785
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:02,543
Scott: Yeah.

786
00:37:02,706 --> 00:37:02,869
Scott: Yeah.

787
00:37:04,402 --> 00:37:05,732
Guest 1: And I forgot that was Ryan North.

788
00:37:06,236 --> 00:37:06,559
Rym: I did, too.

789
00:37:06,942 --> 00:37:08,512
Rym: Oh, so Marvel or DC?

790
00:37:09,197 --> 00:37:09,580
Scott: Oh, yes.

791
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,478
Scott: You got two different cats fighting there.

792
00:37:13,483 --> 00:37:14,227
Guest 1: I can't help it.

793
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,979
Guest 1: I'm a long term Batman fan.

794
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:19,720
Rym: OK, do you like any DC other than Batman and things that are tied to Batman?

795
00:37:20,182 --> 00:37:22,880
Guest 1: I love the Justice League cartoon series.

796
00:37:23,942 --> 00:37:28,580
Scott: Oh, you don't like, say, a booster gold or a green lantern.

797
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,899
Guest 1: I do love Superman singles.

798
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,779
Guest 1: So Superman for all seasons is fantastic.

799
00:37:34,282 --> 00:37:38,077
Guest 1: Brian Azzarello's Lex Luthor comic.

800
00:37:38,458 --> 00:37:38,860
Guest 1: Fantastic.

801
00:37:40,544 --> 00:37:41,677
Guest 1: What what else is in DC?

802
00:37:45,186 --> 00:37:45,973
Guest 1: All right.

803
00:37:46,053 --> 00:37:46,820
Guest 1: Question answered.

804
00:37:47,301 --> 00:37:48,560
Guest 1: Teen Titans Go is great.

805
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,220
Rym: Teen Titans Go is literally the greatest Teen Titans.

806
00:37:51,905 --> 00:37:53,380
Rym: I consider that the Teen Titans canon.

807
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,847
Guest 1: Yeah, no, absolutely.

808
00:37:54,907 --> 00:37:57,060
Guest 1: The pie song should be playing all the time.

809
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:57,562
Rym: I don't know.

810
00:37:57,582 --> 00:37:59,879
Rym: I like that piece and love piece.

811
00:38:00,761 --> 00:38:03,060
Scott: And I dare you to read 80s Teen Titans and tell me what's happening.

812
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,679
Guest 1: Challenge accepted.

813
00:38:07,742 --> 00:38:08,404
Rym: All right.

814
00:38:08,424 --> 00:38:14,200
Rym: So DC, because what is your favorite Batman version of all the Batmans that have existed?

815
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,018
Rym: There's a lot of Batmans.

816
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,609
Guest 0: There's a bat ham.

817
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:18,439
Guest 0: I'm leaving the show.

818
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,439
Rym: I guess Batman's already got back going on.

819
00:38:22,688 --> 00:38:23,900
Guest 1: So Batman has spiders.

820
00:38:25,323 --> 00:38:27,480
Scott: I mean, you know, there's like Adam West, corny Batman.

821
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:30,400
Scott: The Silver Age Batman is original Batman who had a gun.

822
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:30,681
Guest 1: Right.

823
00:38:30,821 --> 00:38:34,134
Rym: OK, so the Dark Knight Returns, like that one particular movie Batman.

824
00:38:35,982 --> 00:38:38,080
Rym: There's the Mask of the Phantasm.

825
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,579
Rym: B-TAS, but serious.

826
00:38:40,363 --> 00:38:41,960
Guest 1: B-TAS Batman is my favorite.

827
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,798
Guest 1: There's a beautiful theater around in D.C.

828
00:38:46,461 --> 00:38:53,051
Guest 1: that on one of our first dates, Conrad and I went to go see Mask of the Phantasm and he fell asleep.

829
00:38:55,421 --> 00:38:57,757
Guest 0: Well, I was on crunch at the time.

830
00:38:58,923 --> 00:39:02,619
Rym: How did you realize that you would have known where the Joker came from?

831
00:39:04,081 --> 00:39:12,559
Guest 1: But but Mask of the Phantasm is great, but also like everything in that kind of Paul Dini verse Batman, the animated series stuff.

832
00:39:12,701 --> 00:39:24,620
Guest 1: I don't know if people have seen Return of the Joker, which is a Batman Beyond movie, but the unrated version of Return of the Joker, which is set in the Batman Beyond universe is amazing.

833
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:28,280
Guest 1: And if you are a Tim Drake fan, it will break your heart.

834
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:33,300
Guest 1: And it's so like I don't love Batman when he's super duper dark.

835
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,680
Guest 1: This is, I would say, gritty detective stuff in a very cool way.

836
00:39:37,941 --> 00:39:40,518
Guest 1: And that kid from Boy Meets World killed it.

837
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:43,300
Rym: I could be into that.

838
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,240
Scott: The guy from Boy Meets World is in a Batman.

839
00:39:45,621 --> 00:39:48,620
Guest 1: Will Friedl does Terry McGinnis' voice.

840
00:39:49,104 --> 00:39:49,233
Scott: OK.

841
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,340
Guest 1: So, Eric.

842
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:51,153
Guest 1: No?

843
00:39:51,662 --> 00:39:52,100
Guest 1: I don't know.

844
00:39:53,411 --> 00:39:53,960
Scott: So the friend.

845
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,139
Guest 1: Yeah, the cute best friend.

846
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:55,510
Guest 1: OK.

847
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:55,813
Guest 1: Yeah.

848
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,700
Guest 1: He does the voice of Terry McGinnis' Batman Beyond.

849
00:40:00,083 --> 00:40:01,840
Guest 1: And he is fantastic.

850
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:02,970
Guest 1: Like, kills it.

851
00:40:04,202 --> 00:40:04,392
Scott: Yeah.

852
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,020
Scott: And he was still alive.

853
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:06,260
Scott: Yeah.

854
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:09,040
Guest 1: No, you got to check out Return of the Joker.

855
00:40:09,482 --> 00:40:11,299
Guest 1: It's it's just absolutely stunning.

856
00:40:11,903 --> 00:40:14,120
Guest 1: And you get to see this weird Joker stuff.

857
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,580
Guest 1: Of course, Mark Hamill does the voice of the Joker.

858
00:40:16,782 --> 00:40:17,200
Guest 1: Of course.

859
00:40:17,443 --> 00:40:17,537
Guest 1: Yeah.

860
00:40:17,601 --> 00:40:18,580
Guest 1: And he's phenomenal.

861
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,860
Scott: He's fighting about that lately.

862
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:20,920
Scott: There was some drama, right?

863
00:40:21,025 --> 00:40:21,193
Scott: What?

864
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,656
Scott: There was something like he didn't do it for something and he is doing it for something else.

865
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:25,320
Scott: I don't know.

866
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,354
Scott: There's something weird going on.

867
00:40:26,926 --> 00:40:27,359
Rym: That laugh.

868
00:40:27,963 --> 00:40:30,500
Scott: I didn't know enough about it to tell the details.

869
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,760
Guest 1: But comics wise, long Halloween Batman for sure.

870
00:40:34,003 --> 00:40:34,400
Rym: All right.

871
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:34,798
Rym: Yeah.

872
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:39,160
Rym: So what is the most recent long novel that you read?

873
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:40,406
Guest 1: OK.

874
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,680
Guest 1: Conrad's going to make fun of me, but this book is amazing.

875
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:45,040
Guest 1: Why not?

876
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:46,238
Guest 1: It's called Mort.

877
00:40:46,761 --> 00:40:50,258
Guest 1: M O R T parentheses E. It's a.

878
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:50,860
Scott: Who's the author?

879
00:40:51,884 --> 00:40:53,260
Guest 1: God, I can't remember the author's name.

880
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,140
Scott: Well, go to Amazon.

881
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:57,620
Guest 1: It is a post apocalyptic dystopian book.

882
00:40:57,824 --> 00:40:58,180
Guest 1: Sounds good.

883
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:05,760
Guest 1: Where ants have been planning the downfall of humanity since Egyptian times.

884
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:17,840
Guest 1: And they finally breed ants with hormones that they release into the air and make all land based animals sentient and human sized.

885
00:41:17,964 --> 00:41:18,320
Scott: All right.

886
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,500
Scott: Next book club book selection.

887
00:41:21,446 --> 00:41:23,579
Rym: I think that is actually the next book club book.

888
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:38,060
Guest 1: Animal militia men take over the world, do a huge purge of all humans, and then it goes into this like kind of animal farm, but upright walking.

889
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,120
Rym: This is the prequel to Bojack Horseman.

890
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,540
Scott: Hey, Ram, you want to kill all humans?

891
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:42,988
Guest 1: Yeah.

892
00:41:43,841 --> 00:41:46,640
Guest 1: And there's like an elaborate global conspiracy.

893
00:41:46,881 --> 00:42:03,640
Guest 1: They have these beautiful scenes where the only way the animals can interface with ants, because ants communicate via hormone, is that the ants created a translator module that the animals can use, but they plug directly into the hive mind.

894
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:11,120
Guest 1: So it takes like a special animal of certain intelligence to kind of process all the information that comes into them from the hive mind.

895
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,620
Guest 1: The best part about this book, though, is that it's beautifully written.

896
00:42:15,021 --> 00:42:19,779
Guest 1: Like the premise is really silly and I've been made fun of for being like a furry.

897
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:25,480
Scott: Oh, I can see some furry assumptions, but I mean, ants are not furry.

898
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,160
Rym: I think they're never.

899
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,279
Scott: I mean, is that called an ante?

900
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:28,860
Scott: What does that call?

901
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:30,237
Rym: I think that's just furry at this point.

902
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:31,892
Scott: It has an exoskeleton.

903
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:33,560
Guest 0: The ants are trying to create a fur-topia.

904
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,213
Guest 0: Like, I get it.

905
00:42:34,664 --> 00:42:35,177
Guest 0: I get it.

906
00:42:35,485 --> 00:42:35,780
Guest 0: Much love.

907
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:36,520
Guest 0: Much respect.

908
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:37,680
Guest 1: But the writing is beautiful.

909
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,799
Scott: Is there a lot of sex in the book?

910
00:42:40,141 --> 00:42:42,152
Guest 1: Well, there is cuddling.

911
00:42:44,132 --> 00:42:44,420
Scott: Okay.

912
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:45,639
Scott: I mean, there's a queen ant.

913
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:46,380
Scott: What are you going to do?

914
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,380
Scott: It's how it goes.

915
00:42:48,582 --> 00:42:50,239
Rym: It's got Jedi told us all about that.

916
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:50,580
Scott: Yeah.

917
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,239
Rym: I mean, when he's like, I need more soldiers.

918
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,819
Rym: I'd like, we're running out of bug room and she's like, all right, come with me.

919
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,959
Rym: And he's like, where are we going to make more bug room?

920
00:42:57,082 --> 00:42:57,256
Scott: Yeah.

921
00:42:57,361 --> 00:42:57,977
Scott: That's just how it goes.

922
00:42:58,503 --> 00:42:58,740
Scott: Let's see.

923
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:00,299
Rym: What's this review says.

924
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:04,140
Rym: Think Orwell's animal farm combined with Heinlein's Starship Troopers.

925
00:43:05,143 --> 00:43:06,699
Guest 1: But it's, it's beautifully written.

926
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,840
Guest 1: The plot makes a whole bunch of sense.

927
00:43:08,941 --> 00:43:10,800
Guest 1: Like the main character's name is Mort.

928
00:43:11,221 --> 00:43:17,258
Guest 1: You know, he's the titular character and his drive is just really easy to empathize with the whole time.

929
00:43:17,943 --> 00:43:20,000
Guest 1: Like, uh, it's, it's just fantastic.

930
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:24,478
Guest 1: There, there's this whole segment where all the animals get to give themselves names, but you have to earn it.

931
00:43:25,281 --> 00:43:32,019
Guest 1: And there's this one like sad nerdy cat who wants to name himself Tiberius, but he never, ever, ever earns it.

932
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:32,780
Rym: Ooh.

933
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:36,540
Rym: This other thing says it's homeward bound crossed with a canticle for Liebowitz.

934
00:43:36,861 --> 00:43:39,020
Scott: Why does it, why does everything have to be crossed with something?

935
00:43:39,641 --> 00:43:43,779
Guest 0: So out of curiosity, uh, the protagonist of this book, who or what is it?

936
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:44,977
Guest 1: He's a cat.

937
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:45,516
Scott: It's a cat.

938
00:43:47,264 --> 00:44:02,699
Guest 1: And he's, there's, there's actually a really cool moment where they talk about the division of pre versus post apocalyptic animals where the, the house pets that were neutered or spayed are like subclass citizens.

939
00:44:03,723 --> 00:44:06,320
Guest 1: So in the new society who have to prove themselves.

940
00:44:06,923 --> 00:44:09,580
Guest 1: And it's, it's really super intense.

941
00:44:09,921 --> 00:44:11,760
Rym: Are you both down with the, uh, Rick and Morty?

942
00:44:12,862 --> 00:44:14,660
Guest 1: Oh gosh, I haven't seen any yet.

943
00:44:15,105 --> 00:44:15,717
Guest 0: I also haven't.

944
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:19,840
Rym: I won't say anything then cause I could, there's a segue there that I'm going to leave out because it's spoilers.

945
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,319
Rym: You should watch Rick and Morty.

946
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,096
Rym: Scott won't watch it, but you guys will like it.

947
00:44:23,562 --> 00:44:24,320
Rym: Scott won't watch anything.

948
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,740
Scott: I have to watch the world series in four minutes.

949
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:27,680
Rym: He won't even watch Bojack.

950
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:28,500
Guest 0: One Punch Man.

951
00:44:29,201 --> 00:44:29,580
Scott: One Punch Man.

952
00:44:30,341 --> 00:44:31,659
Scott: Why aren't you watching One Punch Man?

953
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:32,880
Rym: Spoiler, Scotty punches.

954
00:44:33,961 --> 00:44:35,420
Scott: The most important anime of our time.

955
00:44:35,561 --> 00:44:39,438
Guest 0: I'm not watching One Punch Man cause my Japanese isn't good enough to watch TV in the background anymore.

956
00:44:40,724 --> 00:44:42,100
Scott: I don't watch anything in the background ever.

957
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:46,919
Scott: I give everything I ever watch or read my full attention, which is probably why I watch a lot less things than everyone else.

958
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:47,280
Guest 1: Yeah.

959
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:48,919
Guest 1: Don't start a game company.

960
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:50,997
Guest 0: Just avoid that entirely.

961
00:44:52,940 --> 00:45:03,999
Rym: It's interesting when you guys have this very entrepreneurial drive because as much as we both, I mean, we have designed a lot of games and then at the end of the day, we look at ourselves and we say, I could just go to work for eight hours a day.

962
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:07,240
Rym: And just play with the money from that.

963
00:45:07,523 --> 00:45:07,818
Rym: All the other.

964
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:09,700
Scott: Like it's a serious question, right?

965
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,420
Scott: Like it's actually really serious, right?

966
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:16,080
Scott: So the reason I don't do what you do is because I'm very, very afraid that if I fail, I'll be homeless.

967
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:16,454
Scott: Right.

968
00:45:16,742 --> 00:45:17,311
Scott: It's possible.

969
00:45:17,453 --> 00:45:17,879
Scott: it could happen.

970
00:45:18,046 --> 00:45:18,279
Scott: Right.

971
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:30,379
Scott: And then I see people who are, who have successful startups and the vast majority of them I've learned, this is more true over time, is that they're almost all rich people who have no risk of being homeless if they fail.

972
00:45:30,901 --> 00:45:32,659
Scott: You're not fabulously wealthy.

973
00:45:33,412 --> 00:45:33,580
Scott: Correct.

974
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,077
Scott: Are you, are you deathly afraid of like, how do you deal with it?

975
00:45:37,117 --> 00:45:37,580
Scott: if you are?

976
00:45:38,703 --> 00:45:40,559
Guest 0: So I touched on this last time I was on the show.

977
00:45:40,783 --> 00:45:41,860
Guest 0: I've always been a freelancer.

978
00:45:43,381 --> 00:45:47,200
Guest 0: I'm very good at being scrappy and finding solutions to problems.

979
00:45:47,801 --> 00:45:56,479
Guest 0: Even when stuff got really bad, you know, I always landed on my feet and you do that long enough and you kind of just get the feeling that like, even when things are bad, they'll probably be okay.

980
00:45:57,181 --> 00:46:01,062
Guest 0: Also, my billable now is much higher than when I was 20.

981
00:46:01,062 --> 00:46:01,839
Guest 0: So that's nice.

982
00:46:02,081 --> 00:46:07,220
Guest 0: But, uh, you know, personally it's, it is scary, but it's not like scary.

983
00:46:07,341 --> 00:46:09,520
Guest 0: Like you're standing on the edge of a cliff or you're skydiving.

984
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:09,989
Guest 0: Scary.

985
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:11,957
Scott: You know, I almost feel like rent makes it really scary.

986
00:46:12,763 --> 00:46:13,058
Guest 1: Yes.

987
00:46:13,761 --> 00:46:15,400
Rym: Well, I mean, I've thought about that a lot.

988
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:20,379
Rym: If I ever did something similar, I would have to leave New York, like pretty much immediately to make that happen.

989
00:46:20,741 --> 00:46:22,600
Rym: So just burn rate wise.

990
00:46:24,243 --> 00:46:38,800
Rym: But it's almost like I feel like, cause other people have expressed this in the sentiment that they said a salary job is very addictive because you get very comfortable with that sort of being there and people who start freelancing.

991
00:46:39,142 --> 00:46:40,200
Scott: I'm not comfortable being there.

992
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,737
Scott: I'm just comfortable getting money all the time.

993
00:46:42,982 --> 00:46:51,380
Guest 1: I will say as a person who quit her job to work for a gaming startup, I miss that feeling of getting paid.

994
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:52,500
Scott: What was your job before?

995
00:46:52,983 --> 00:46:53,260
Guest 1: Yeah.

996
00:46:53,381 --> 00:46:55,460
Guest 1: Well, I will say to answer your question from earlier.

997
00:46:55,862 --> 00:47:04,860
Guest 1: I wasn't as worried about quitting my job and jumping into this like goofy lifestyle because I had six years professional experience doing web project management.

998
00:47:05,941 --> 00:47:12,700
Guest 1: So in grown up jobs where the work was very meaningless, but my skills were very meaningful.

999
00:47:13,361 --> 00:47:16,220
Guest 1: That's essentially what I'm doing for date night to a project.

1000
00:47:16,741 --> 00:47:27,648
Guest 1: So like eventually if we go bankrupt and we, you know, we're on the streets, I'll actually be able to just say on my resume, I was a project manager and I can jump right back in.

1001
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:29,140
Guest 0: Yeah.

1002
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:29,334
Guest 0: Yeah.

1003
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:31,640
Guest 0: There's no break in our resumes, you know?

1004
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:37,019
Guest 0: So like in the worst case scenario, we'll just get different high paying jobs and that will be the end of it.

1005
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:39,720
Guest 0: Like for us, it's not, personally, I'm not that scared.

1006
00:47:40,166 --> 00:47:40,559
Guest 0: Are you?

1007
00:47:41,264 --> 00:47:41,331
Guest 1: No.

1008
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:41,879
Guest 0: I hope not.

1009
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:42,113
Guest 0: Cool.

1010
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:42,657
Guest 1: Not really.

1011
00:47:44,582 --> 00:47:49,138
Guest 1: It is very scary kind of watching my bank account go lower and lower.

1012
00:47:50,204 --> 00:47:52,260
Scott: I think you're also a pet, right?

1013
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:54,520
Scott: You're at the point where you made a game in 12 weeks, right?

1014
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:57,740
Scott: So that's like you've already, you know, you can actually produce something.

1015
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:58,860
Scott: You have produced things, right?

1016
00:47:59,281 --> 00:48:02,880
Scott: I think the scariness for me would come in the before succeeding part.

1017
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:07,199
Rym: I mean, it's got, we, as much as we talk about this, we've never actually made a vertical slice of a game.

1018
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:07,997
Scott: Never made anything.

1019
00:48:09,586 --> 00:48:10,239
Guest 0: Make a radio show.

1020
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:10,676
Scott: That's it.

1021
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:11,400
Scott: That doesn't take much.

1022
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:12,079
Scott: You sit around and talk.

1023
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:12,917
Scott: Anyone can do this.

1024
00:48:13,107 --> 00:48:13,240
Guest 1: Yeah.

1025
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:15,956
Guest 1: Pitch us the GeekNights dating SIM and let us know how that goes.

1026
00:48:17,161 --> 00:48:17,760
Scott: Nice dating SIM.

1027
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:20,959
Scott: You're, you're commuting on your, it's everyone's go commuter, right?

1028
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:22,357
Rym: It's Scott.

1029
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,460
Rym: So you have three dialogue options in most places.

1030
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,639
Scott: You can commute on a train or a car.

1031
00:48:26,902 --> 00:48:28,500
Scott: You can't listen to a podcast on a bike.

1032
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:29,380
Scott: You listen to GeekNights.

1033
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,739
Scott: You can't really talk to anyone cause you listen to GeekNights on the train.

1034
00:48:32,321 --> 00:48:34,859
Scott: You get to work, you go home.

1035
00:48:35,362 --> 00:48:38,040
Scott: There isn't another episode of the GeekNights cause we only make two a week.

1036
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:38,839
Guest 0: But you know what there is?

1037
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,079
Scott: You have to date someone on the train.

1038
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,778
Guest 0: An older episode of one punch, man.

1039
00:48:43,602 --> 00:48:45,240
Scott: There's only three or four episodes so far.

1040
00:48:45,341 --> 00:48:46,179
Scott: You can watch the show.

1041
00:48:46,321 --> 00:48:47,540
Scott: It's on Hulu and Crunchyroll.

1042
00:48:50,681 --> 00:48:52,411
Scott: The manga just, I just got to first.

1043
00:48:52,451 --> 00:48:54,027
Scott: two volumes of the manga just came in the mail.

1044
00:48:54,543 --> 00:48:55,819
Scott: Uh, they're publishing it in English now.

1045
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,520
Rym: Just like you haven't watched Steven universe.

1046
00:48:57,780 --> 00:48:58,178
Rym: You haven't watched.

1047
00:48:59,243 --> 00:48:59,840
Scott: It's in my queue.

1048
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:00,699
Scott: It's just sitting there waiting.

1049
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:02,639
Rym: Some of these things should go to the top of the queue.

1050
00:49:03,261 --> 00:49:04,939
Scott: Uh, the world series is happening right now.

1051
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:06,319
Rym: The world series is going to be at the top.

1052
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:07,520
Rym: I'll let you, I'll let you have that.

1053
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,278
Guest 0: That's time limited.

1054
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:09,439
Rym: I'm watching a lot of hockey.

1055
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:10,719
Guest 1: The world series of what?

1056
00:49:11,728 --> 00:49:11,920
Guest 1: Dude.

1057
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:12,899
Guest 1: I only watch hockey too.

1058
00:49:13,324 --> 00:49:14,120
Guest 1: What, what's the world series?

1059
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:16,393
Rym: So you're, uh, what team do you recruit?

1060
00:49:17,581 --> 00:49:18,739
Rym: For in hockey?

1061
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:21,599
Guest 1: C a P S caps, caps, caps, sabers.

1062
00:49:22,023 --> 00:49:22,290
Scott: What's up?

1063
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:25,019
Scott: You mean C H O K E choke, choke, choke.

1064
00:49:25,883 --> 00:49:27,820
Rym: You know, the sabers are not the blue jackets.

1065
00:49:29,101 --> 00:49:29,311
Rym: Yeah.

1066
00:49:29,761 --> 00:49:30,117
Scott: It's even.

1067
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:33,339
Scott: Would you rather have a team that's gloriously shitty?

1068
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:37,711
Scott: Like the lion jackets, lions, the cubs where you just never win or right.

1069
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,380
Scott: It's much worse to be a fan of the caps.

1070
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:43,540
Scott: You've got Ovechkin.

1071
00:49:43,963 --> 00:49:44,699
Scott: You get to the play.

1072
00:49:44,841 --> 00:49:45,951
Guest 1: And then you cannot win anything.

1073
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:49,140
Scott: Like the San Diego chargers.

1074
00:49:49,221 --> 00:49:49,499
Scott: Oh yeah.

1075
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:50,159
Scott: We're really good.

1076
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:50,679
Scott: No, you're not.

1077
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:51,600
Scott: You can't get past it.

1078
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,928
Guest 1: I will say I am biased because I did.

1079
00:49:53,948 --> 00:50:01,180
Guest 1: the apartment that I used to rent like four or five years ago was actually in the building where the caps have their practices.

1080
00:50:01,867 --> 00:50:02,418
Rym: Oh yeah.

1081
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:06,113
Guest 1: So you could, you could always go upstairs and watch them for free.

1082
00:50:06,595 --> 00:50:08,558
Guest 1: and uh, they're fantastic on the ice.

1083
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:09,800
Guest 1: Like they look great.

1084
00:50:10,302 --> 00:50:11,998
Guest 1: They do choke in the playoffs every year.

1085
00:50:13,022 --> 00:50:14,600
Rym: And they're respectable teams.

1086
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:15,518
Scott: It's very useful for us.

1087
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:15,900
Scott: Rangers.

1088
00:50:16,101 --> 00:50:17,339
Scott: They choked against the rain.

1089
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,440
Guest 1: And then you lost to Florida.

1090
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,960
Guest 1: Cause Florida, there's no ice in Florida.

1091
00:50:22,725 --> 00:50:23,619
Scott: You lost to Tampa.

1092
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:24,738
Scott: You didn't lose to Florida.

1093
00:50:26,045 --> 00:50:27,199
Scott: It's very different teams.

1094
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:30,860
Rym: I want to point out that those Tampa games were weird.

1095
00:50:31,061 --> 00:50:32,265
Rym: Like really swingy.

1096
00:50:32,627 --> 00:50:38,699
Scott: Tampa was playing like they were playing a sort of like a Stanley cup more recently than the New York Rangers.

1097
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,199
Rym: But they also wiped out the red wings.

1098
00:50:41,361 --> 00:50:43,900
Rym: Like they were surprisingly doing well in the plan.

1099
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,660
Scott: Tampa has been a good team for a long time.

1100
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,058
Scott: The Florida is a different story.

1101
00:50:47,262 --> 00:50:47,576
Guest 1: All right.

1102
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:51,898
Rym: The only people I feel bad for is the Blackhawks because the real last year was like their last guest.

1103
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:53,940
Scott: Why are there two hockey teams in Florida?

1104
00:50:54,888 --> 00:50:55,720
Scott: That's the real question.

1105
00:50:55,800 --> 00:51:00,700
Guest 1: I will say I always feel bad for the Bruins because it must suck to live in Boston.

1106
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:01,596
Guest 1: Yeah.

1107
00:51:02,443 --> 00:51:04,879
Guest 1: Every Boston sports team can suck it.

1108
00:51:06,009 --> 00:51:06,360
Scott: I'm okay.

1109
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,820
Scott: You know, a lot of people in New York are all hating on Boston.

1110
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,339
Scott: It's like, I'm okay with Boston.

1111
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:13,059
Guest 1: It's like, I'm like, I'm like, okay, Boston.

1112
00:51:13,241 --> 00:51:15,497
Scott: Philly needs to dine to five Philadelphia.

1113
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:17,106
Guest 1: Right.

1114
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:20,120
Scott: Cause I mean, like I've been to, I've been to Patriots games, right?

1115
00:51:20,241 --> 00:51:25,119
Scott: It's like, you know, they got the stupid horn they blow in third down, but I mean, they're not awful people.

1116
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,760
Guest 1: Like I still, yes, they are.

1117
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,620
Guest 1: They run the score whenever they can.

1118
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:29,359
Guest 1: They run the dam.

1119
00:51:30,022 --> 00:51:31,180
Scott: Do you mean they're trying to win?

1120
00:51:31,381 --> 00:51:31,897
Scott: I respect that.

1121
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:33,300
Guest 1: They're not just trying to win.

1122
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:34,217
Guest 1: They're trying to be mean.

1123
00:51:34,681 --> 00:51:35,219
Rym: Stop them.

1124
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:36,339
Scott: How come you can't stop that?

1125
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:37,320
Guest 1: Because you suck.

1126
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:43,171
Scott: That's like saying a bully is being, is just trying to play a game and try to win and be good at it.

1127
00:51:43,821 --> 00:51:47,740
Rym: Did Conrad ever tell you about caps are up by two goals?

1128
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:49,740
Scott: Should they just stop scoring and just skate around in a circle?

1129
00:51:50,046 --> 00:51:50,234
Guest 1: Yes.

1130
00:51:51,026 --> 00:51:51,277
Rym: No.

1131
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:52,759
Scott: Because a win is still a win.

1132
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:55,900
Scott: And that's why you can't make it past the playoffs in the first round.

1133
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,190
Guest 0: This is why we make dating sims.

1134
00:51:59,145 --> 00:52:00,058
Guest 1: I'll put that right out.

1135
00:52:02,862 --> 00:52:07,239
Scott: The reason I hate Philadelphia teams is because it's about, it's not about what the teams do, right?

1136
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,679
Scott: I mean, they're just playing the sport, whatever sport happens to be.

1137
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:12,340
Scott: The fans are a piece of shit, right?

1138
00:52:12,584 --> 00:52:13,620
Scott: If you go to Boston, sure.

1139
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:16,320
Guest 1: Some red Sox fans, some red fans are shit, right?

1140
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:20,000
Scott: Some red Sox fans might give you some lip, but they're not going to do anything to you.

1141
00:52:20,181 --> 00:52:20,719
Guest 1: Boston kickstarter.

1142
00:52:21,681 --> 00:52:25,658
Scott: Philadelphia throwing snowballs at Santa Claus, right?

1143
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:26,859
Scott: They're starting there.

1144
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,140
Scott: When they, when they win, they set their town on fire.

1145
00:52:29,181 --> 00:52:30,378
Scott: Who knows what they're going to do when they lose.

1146
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:36,740
Guest 0: I want you to know as a date night to representative, we love your city and thank you so much for your support in our kickstart.

1147
00:52:39,202 --> 00:52:41,680
Rym: You know, Boston also you have a pack, so things are going okay.

1148
00:52:41,862 --> 00:52:42,654
Guest 1: You have a path.

1149
00:52:42,735 --> 00:52:43,080
Guest 0: that yeah.

1150
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:45,610
Guest 0: In the worst place in the world zone was that I cannot imagine.

1151
00:52:50,181 --> 00:52:51,459
Rym: Imagine packs at the job.

1152
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:52,178
Guest 1: Oh God.

1153
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:57,420
Guest 1: Having, having hosted a couple of conferences in Philadelphia, Philadelphia is a nightmare.

1154
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:58,400
Rym: It packs worth the Javits.

1155
00:52:58,560 --> 00:52:58,966
Rym: I wouldn't go.

1156
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:02,714
Guest 1: How about fighting words.

1157
00:53:02,754 --> 00:53:03,799
Rym: you've been to the Javits.

1158
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:04,960
Guest 1: I've been to the job.

1159
00:53:05,141 --> 00:53:07,440
Guest 0: I didn't even go to New York, the damn Javits.

1160
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,750
Scott: But at least you could fill the whole con in the Javits.

1161
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:16,680
Guest 1: I'm like in Seattle and bless, I loved my time at PAX Prime.

1162
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:22,619
Guest 1: I did not love my time trying to figure out even which building I was supposed to be in and any given time.

1163
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:25,340
Scott: Yeah, we, we have the luxury of being experts who've been there many times.

1164
00:53:25,481 --> 00:53:28,978
Scott: If this is my first ever PAX Prime, yeah, I would be like, because it used to not be that way.

1165
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:35,600
Rym: Like in all these expanded things, like they split off like one by one first year we went, they weren't even using the entire main building.

1166
00:53:35,902 --> 00:53:39,040
Guest 1: I will say marijuana is legal in Washington.

1167
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:42,420
Guest 1: I could not find any packs room.

1168
00:53:43,186 --> 00:53:43,540
Rym: Yeah.

1169
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:44,999
Scott: Just hanging out with the wrong people.

1170
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:54,038
Rym: The funny thing is, so fun fact, many of our friends had never had marijuana before and we were enjoying ourselves, but there was a moment late at night where we're playing a game.

1171
00:53:54,660 --> 00:54:05,098
Rym: Everyone in the game except Scott had consumed a considerable amount of marijuana and yet Scott was the one who was having giggling fits and like flipping out and messing up in the game.

1172
00:54:05,403 --> 00:54:05,747
Scott: That was later.

1173
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:07,780
Rym: You were just giggling.

1174
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:08,240
Rym: We were playing.

1175
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:09,480
Rym: It was the last game of fresh fish.

1176
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:10,660
Rym: You were just giggling the whole time.

1177
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:12,040
Scott: That came by a lot.

1178
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:12,940
Rym: And you were giggling.

1179
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:17,478
Scott: I was running up to score my cards right next to the mood.

1180
00:54:19,021 --> 00:54:21,259
Guest 1: There's no better aphrodisiac than good company.

1181
00:54:23,101 --> 00:54:26,220
Guest 0: So Joe, any other topic, please.

1182
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:35,720
Rym: So Conrad went to RIT with us and RIT at a hockey team and a RIT was a division two team and when division two disappeared, they were division three team.

1183
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:36,678
Scott: There was no division two.

1184
00:54:37,044 --> 00:54:37,939
Rym: They were a two team.

1185
00:54:38,181 --> 00:54:38,577
Rym: They were two.

1186
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:39,319
Rym: Two was removed.

1187
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:40,959
Scott: That was a zillion years ago.

1188
00:54:41,461 --> 00:54:42,098
Scott: That was decades ago.

1189
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:48,438
Rym: That was a good two team was pushed into three because of NCAA rules because there's no football team there.

1190
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:54,077
Rym: So there was a game, a famous game, RIT beat a team from Newman, 24 to nothing.

1191
00:54:56,411 --> 00:54:56,740
Scott: Ice hockey.

1192
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:00,440
Rym: They continued to score goals as fast as possible without abating.

1193
00:55:00,521 --> 00:55:02,679
Rym: In fact, they played harder in the last five minutes.

1194
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:05,780
Rym: They were trying to get it to 30.

1195
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:07,177
Guest 0: Listen, RIT doesn't have much.

1196
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:08,980
Guest 0: We have so little.

1197
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:10,060
Guest 0: Just give us this one thing.

1198
00:55:10,222 --> 00:55:10,438
Guest 0: Okay.

1199
00:55:11,121 --> 00:55:19,859
Guest 1: I did hear it's easier to get into Harvard if you play ice hockey because they always lose to Yale and they cannot be doing that.

1200
00:55:21,001 --> 00:55:23,479
Guest 0: What does that say about Yale's recruitment tactics though?

1201
00:55:25,221 --> 00:55:37,720
Scott: It's actually like historically, like, you know, because Yale doesn't do all like the shady sports stuff that like, you know, Florida or California universities will do to get like a plus sports teams that are like, you know, nationally renowned or whatever.

1202
00:55:37,861 --> 00:55:41,220
Scott: But historically speaking, Yale, like the Yale bowl is there.

1203
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:45,960
Scott: That is like, you know, the home of sports at college is Yale, right?

1204
00:55:46,521 --> 00:55:49,915
Rym: So old days where people are guys are wearing fur coats and also those little.

1205
00:55:50,076 --> 00:55:53,620
Scott: also the Yale bowl is a crazy place to watch football.

1206
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:54,179
Scott: You should go.

1207
00:55:54,641 --> 00:55:55,740
Scott: It doesn't look like anything else.

1208
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:56,739
Scott: It actually looks like a bowl.

1209
00:55:57,262 --> 00:55:58,819
Rym: It's like like a soup bowl.

1210
00:55:59,604 --> 00:56:00,839
Scott: It's a really weird place to go.

1211
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:01,478
Scott: I've been there once.

1212
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:02,379
Rym: It's like what kind of bowl?

1213
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:02,721
Rym: Like.

1214
00:56:02,741 --> 00:56:04,439
Scott: there's like, go look at a picture of the Yale bowl.

1215
00:56:05,041 --> 00:56:06,227
Scott: It's like it's.

1216
00:56:06,448 --> 00:56:09,040
Scott: it's like there's just a field and then there's just a bowl coming down.

1217
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:09,878
Guest 1: I will say Rym.

1218
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:23,020
Guest 1: You and Emily have got to visit us in DC at some point because less than five miles away from where I live is the ice stadium where both the caps practice, but also the FBI and the Secret Service have their annual ice hockey face off.

1219
00:56:23,181 --> 00:56:23,976
Scott: We hate both of them.

1220
00:56:25,004 --> 00:56:26,500
Scott: I guess I might root for the Secret Service.

1221
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:31,118
Rym: Yeah, I would rather the Secret Service be company, even though they paid you a visit because we need.

1222
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:31,353
Rym: Yeah.

1223
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:32,019
Rym: A long time ago.

1224
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:34,100
Guest 1: It's like the Army Navy of ice hockey.

1225
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:36,858
Rym: But worse, I've told the story and it's like five times fine.

1226
00:56:37,725 --> 00:56:38,540
Rym: But it happened.

1227
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:45,818
Rym: It involved a slash dot thread and a suggestion about DDO, messing them with posts on other forums.

1228
00:56:46,986 --> 00:56:47,900
Rym: And it led to an interview.

1229
00:56:48,290 --> 00:56:48,499
Rym: All right.

1230
00:56:49,006 --> 00:56:49,877
Scott: I got to make a move soon.

1231
00:56:50,349 --> 00:56:50,519
Rym: Yes.

1232
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:50,680
Rym: Yes.

1233
00:56:51,001 --> 00:56:52,260
Scott: This is our going along anyway.

1234
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,960
Rym: So watch the Mets definitely win the World Series.

1235
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:55,353
Scott: Yeah.

1236
00:56:55,562 --> 00:56:55,775
Scott: Who knows?

1237
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:56,599
Rym: Hundred percent.

1238
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:57,275
Scott: Can't say.

1239
00:56:59,103 --> 00:57:00,480
Rym: See, I'm not I'm not from New York.

1240
00:57:00,601 --> 00:57:03,839
Rym: So I'm confident saying, oh, the Red Wings will win the Stanley Cup because that won't curse them.

1241
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:08,718
Rym: But apparently the New Yorker and you if you say, yeah, we're up by four, the third period will be fine.

1242
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:09,778
Rym: They'll immediately lose.

1243
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:10,980
Guest 0: So I'm from Buffalo.

1244
00:57:11,081 --> 00:57:13,560
Guest 0: We weren't even allowed to breathe at those games last week.

1245
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:14,519
Guest 1: Disrupt the ball.

1246
00:57:15,783 --> 00:57:18,500
Scott: So, Ram, when the year that you met me, right.

1247
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:22,699
Scott: Do you remember anything about, you know, my personal affectation?

1248
00:57:25,407 --> 00:57:25,959
Rym: Which one?

1249
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:33,160
Scott: I wore a Mets hat for like five years of my life every single day because you grew up.

1250
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:33,674
Rym: You grew up.

1251
00:57:34,041 --> 00:57:34,290
Rym: Mets fan.

1252
00:57:34,885 --> 00:57:35,319
Scott: I didn't.

1253
00:57:35,682 --> 00:57:36,097
Scott: I didn't grow up.

1254
00:57:36,261 --> 00:57:36,760
Scott: But I've always been.

1255
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:37,316
Scott: You grew up.

1256
00:57:37,865 --> 00:57:38,580
Scott: Born is genetic.

1257
00:57:38,782 --> 00:57:39,558
Rym: They picked it into you.

1258
00:57:40,802 --> 00:57:43,860
Scott: I have not worn a Mets hat since like two thousand.

1259
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:45,300
Rym: Did you buy a new Mets hat?

1260
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:52,576
Scott: For the first day I've worn a Mets hat since two thousand over fourteen, fifteen years ago.

1261
00:57:52,922 --> 00:57:55,500
Guest 0: I'm changing my handle to Scott's Mets hat, right?

1262
00:57:58,363 --> 00:58:00,897
Rym: I'll change mine to Mets win World Series guaranteed 100 percent.

1263
00:58:01,401 --> 00:58:01,899
Guest 0: One hundred percent.

1264
00:58:02,021 --> 00:58:02,358
Guest 0: Definitely.

1265
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,180
Rym: And my icon will be Babe Ruth pointing.

1266
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:06,098
Scott: Babe Ruth has never hung the Mets.

1267
00:58:11,602 --> 00:58:12,367
Rym: So it's got some like you had.

1268
00:58:12,428 --> 00:58:14,079
Rym: one last question, right?

1269
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:18,320
Scott: You wrap this up somehow so we can get that.

1270
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:19,159
Rym: That's your yeah.

1271
00:58:19,301 --> 00:58:19,799
Rym: That's your question.

1272
00:58:20,145 --> 00:58:20,356
Scott: Yes.

1273
00:58:20,946 --> 00:58:21,053
Guest 1: OK.

1274
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:22,209
Guest 1: Shoot up.

00:58:23,526 --> 00:58:24,239
Rym: I mean, hustle cat.

1276
00:58:24,381 --> 00:58:29,279
Rym: We're going to plug the crap out of because it's you can you can date cats and it sounds like you can also be a cat.

00:58:29,626 --> 00:58:29,816
Guest 1: Yeah.

1278
00:58:31,153 --> 00:58:31,237
Guest 1: Yeah.

1279
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:32,759
Guest 1: So let's do a plug for that.

1280
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:34,717
Rym: Gosh.

1281
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:35,960
Rym: There's only like a week left.

1282
00:58:36,021 --> 00:58:37,219

Guest 0: You can play them.

1298
00:59:12,841 --> 00:59:15,780
Rym: So if you had to date someone in the BoJack universe, who would it be?

1299
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:16,290
Rym: Both of you.

1300
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:17,298
Guest 1: Princess Caroline.

1301
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:18,260
Guest 0: Princess Caroline.

1302
00:59:18,722 --> 00:59:19,167
Rym: I want to.

1303
00:59:20,661 --> 00:59:21,839
Rym: Princess Caroline is pretty bad ass.

1304
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:23,815
Guest 0: She's the dopest dude.

1305
00:59:25,245 --> 00:59:26,320
Guest 0: Basically dating Princess Caroline.

1306
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:27,498
Guest 0: So that's nice for me.

1307
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:31,960
Rym: But I was about to like a more subtle implication that that is true.

1308
00:59:32,021 --> 00:59:32,939
Rym: But you just went full on.

1309
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:33,346
Guest 0: No.

1310
00:59:33,523 --> 00:59:33,797
Guest 0: Fuck it.

1311
00:59:34,621 --> 00:59:35,896
Rym: That's that's a persona right there.

1312
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:37,839
Guest 0: All right.

1313
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:38,598
Guest 0: Thank you so much again.

1322
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:17,570
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1323
01:00:37,450 --> 01:00:43,150
Rym: And again, per the text on our Patreon, which says, and I quote, This is super dumb.

1324
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:52,310
Rym: But if you support us this much, Rym will say your name at the end of each episode after the credits, along with some ultra dumb stinger content.

1325
01:00:52,530 --> 01:00:53,941
Rym: We're talking Rym.

1326
01:00:54,002 --> 01:00:55,010
Rym: YouTube likes dumb.

1327
01:00:55,630 --> 01:00:59,230
Rym: So once again, I'm going to read these in money giving order.

1328
01:00:59,830 --> 01:01:02,208
Rym: So I already see something here.

1329
01:01:03,030 --> 01:01:10,189
Rym: So to the gentleman who's going to be the one, two, three, four, well, or lady, I don't know, fifth person, my hat is off to you.

01:01:38,592 --> 01:01:42,230
Rym: And now I present to you something really dumb.

1332
01:01:48,631 --> 01:02:10,526
Rym: [Singing] Welcome to the show that hasn't been named, starring Rym and Scott, version alpha, alpha, alpha one, the first one.

1333
01:02:13,033 --> 01:02:15,889
Scott: Oh, so you're going to start with crazy thing thing.

1334
01:02:17,051 --> 01:02:18,049
Scott: My day was kind of boring.

1335
01:02:18,250 --> 01:02:20,610
Scott: I was real tired at work and I almost fell asleep.

1336
01:02:22,131 --> 01:02:30,827
Scott: I saw a guy the way from my work to the train station and he was big, tall, fat guy, not fat, not crazy obese, just fat guy.

1337
01:02:32,071 --> 01:02:34,229
Scott: And he had a top hat with a feather in it.

1338
01:02:34,330 --> 01:02:36,710
Scott: He was walking kind of funny, like the penguin almost.

1339
01:02:36,890 --> 01:02:44,028
Guest 1: And then when I got to the train station, there was a shorter fat guy with a mustache and he had a boulder hat on.

1340
01:02:45,633 --> 01:02:47,709
Guest 1: So I saw two funny hats in rapid succession.
