00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,280
Rym: It's Wednesday, December 16th, 2015.

2
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,203
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,403 --> 00:00:15,750
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,589
Rym: Miyazaki's castle in the sky, Lapita that we somehow never reviewed in all these years.

5
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:24,127
Rym: Let's do this.

6
00:00:26,371 --> 00:00:36,670
Rym: There was a time not that long ago when new episodes of attack on Titan were coming and I was kind of pumped to see the next one because I really wanted to know what all the secrets were like.

7
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,922
Rym: I really the show was not that great.

8
00:00:38,982 --> 00:00:40,490
Scott: There's a terrible secret of space.

9
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,390
Scott: Yeah, but I really what's in the castle with the king?

10
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:47,909
Rym: I really needed to know the answers to all those secrets and I kept watching the show and I and it had.

11
00:00:47,929 --> 00:00:48,090
Rym: you know.

12
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,125
Rym: The show's not bad like the air like the flying around and the plot.

13
00:00:51,205 --> 00:00:52,270
Scott: I read a lot of the manga.

14
00:00:52,351 --> 00:01:03,490
Scott: I have a lot of the manga and they reveal these secrets and It's like there aren't a lot of secrets left But they don't tell you like about that fucking door house or whatever with the guy's dad.

15
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:04,998
Scott: It's like they don't tell you the real secret.

16
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:05,764
Scott: It's like geez.

17
00:01:05,824 --> 00:01:06,186
Scott: What the hell?

18
00:01:06,206 --> 00:01:06,810
Scott: I don't understand.

19
00:01:07,194 --> 00:01:08,549
Scott: So I doesn't make a lot of sense.

20
00:01:09,054 --> 00:01:16,184
Rym: I went out there and I found Summaries and I read every possible spoiler of attack on Titan that could possibly be found.

21
00:01:16,224 --> 00:01:17,548
Scott: it really Peters out a lot.

22
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:22,848
Scott: Ah Based on everything I know about they don't keep up the mystery of the secret of space.

23
00:01:22,889 --> 00:01:35,909
Rym: very well If the rate of things being revealed from the first anime is an indication The entirety of what I know that happens after the anime will take about nine years to make it out in anime form.

24
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:40,726
Rym: I Also knowing what the answers are like I just don't care anymore.

25
00:01:40,746 --> 00:01:41,490
Scott: I never care.

26
00:01:43,676 --> 00:01:45,229
Rym: If a new attack on Titan anime happens.

27
00:01:45,733 --> 00:01:48,730
Rym: I might watch it eventually but I'm not gonna watch it until it's all out.

28
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,382
Scott: Anyone wants a whole lot of volumes of attack on Titan manga.

29
00:01:51,422 --> 00:01:51,784
Scott: I have them.

30
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:53,876
Rym: Yeah, I didn't read the mom I couldn't.

31
00:01:53,936 --> 00:01:55,450
Rym: the manga was not great.

32
00:01:56,253 --> 00:02:01,794
Rym: I would rather just read a Wikipedia or like a Wikipedia page that tells me the plot then read the manga It's like in order.

33
00:02:02,015 --> 00:02:04,045
Rym: one anime is best to Wikia.

34
00:02:04,266 --> 00:02:10,108
Rym: three the manga For your annoying friend who knows more about it because they read the manga and you didn't.

35
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:20,335
Scott: also There's a whole bunch of spin-off mangas about like one or two volumes each one to see what the deal was all bad, but seriously, I'm not gonna spoil it for you guys, but The things you don't know.

36
00:02:20,355 --> 00:02:22,945
Rym: there's some things that you probably think are gonna be really cool.

37
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:27,382
Rym: They are not that cool Fact some of them pretty dumb.

38
00:02:27,502 --> 00:02:32,206
Scott: the dumb king really, you know The secret of what it's like cuz the king is like this mysterious character.

39
00:02:32,226 --> 00:02:33,090
Scott: Like who is the king?

40
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,173
Scott: How did they become king?

41
00:02:34,213 --> 00:02:37,123
Scott: and it right the truth of who the king is and whatnot.

42
00:02:37,484 --> 00:02:39,390
Scott: that pretty much was like the final straw.

43
00:02:39,651 --> 00:02:54,110
Rym: I guess what really bothers me in retrospect is that there are things that happen in the show that based on the world You are presented with Everyone who witnessed those events should treat that like the most damning crazy revelation in history.

44
00:02:54,391 --> 00:02:57,187
Rym: It'd be like if Bigfoot literally just crashed through our window and said hello.

45
00:02:57,227 --> 00:02:59,976
Rym: right now Like that's how people should be reacting.

46
00:03:00,397 --> 00:03:05,309
Rym: and yet almost no one reacts to those events in the show at all.

47
00:03:06,313 --> 00:03:13,622
Rym: So it's hard to gauge what the actual plot is Or the history or anything unless you just read spoilers or know it all.

48
00:03:14,244 --> 00:03:15,528
Rym: I just kind of petered out on that.

49
00:03:15,568 --> 00:03:18,117
Scott: show Doesn't have a lot of staying power.

50
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:18,600
Rym: Nope.

51
00:03:19,042 --> 00:03:19,564
Scott: You never did.

52
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:23,947
Rym: we said that from the beginning Yep, and now it's kind of confirmed at least for me now that I know everything.

53
00:03:24,027 --> 00:03:24,510
Rym: it was confirmed.

54
00:03:26,038 --> 00:03:27,485
Rym: So it's it's Wednesday got any news.

55
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:33,202
Scott: Yes, so Faku your boys the masters of American hentai good dudes.

56
00:03:33,322 --> 00:03:45,206
Scott: Yeah, they they are going to launch a Kickstarter and this Kickstarter is Because they want to license and publish in English some mangas some hentai mangas.

57
00:03:45,387 --> 00:03:52,821
Scott: All right, including La blue girl the most famous hentai Perhaps the one that most anime fans have not actually seen.

58
00:03:53,002 --> 00:04:00,119
Scott: but everyone talked about demon beast invasion Which I know nothing about but has a cool name Adventure kid, which doesn't have a cool name.

59
00:04:00,179 --> 00:04:02,850
Scott: It might makes me think of an adventure island with the kid on the skateboard.

60
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:05,221
Rym: I was about to say that sounds like I'm pretty sure it's hentai.

61
00:04:05,241 --> 00:04:13,355
Scott: Yep, and most importantly Took a doji legend of the overfeed the number one Violent.

62
00:04:13,757 --> 00:04:16,209
Rym: I feel like that anime bad anime.

63
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:25,209
Scott: So the manga was published in six volumes by CPM a long time ago like ten years ago But apparently it was censored and things were removed.

64
00:04:25,571 --> 00:04:32,710
Scott: Fak is gonna give the uncut full real-deal legit release that does not exist in English in a legal way currently.

65
00:04:33,091 --> 00:04:46,634
Rym: It is weird how pervasive the legend of the overfeed is in American and British Anime fan culture like most people I know have not actually seen it but Everyone has heard of it.

66
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:50,243
Rym: It's the default joke answer when anyone asks anyone.

67
00:04:50,263 --> 00:04:52,509
Rym: Hey, what anime should I show my mom?

68
00:04:53,551 --> 00:04:54,067
Scott: apocalypse zero.

69
00:04:55,672 --> 00:05:01,798
Scott: But they're actually working like they're legit like they're working together with Toshio Maeda Who's the guy who made legend of the overfeed?

70
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:05,130
Scott: So this isn't like, you know some unofficial deal.

71
00:05:05,251 --> 00:05:07,403
Scott: This is like the most legit that it can be.

72
00:05:07,443 --> 00:05:10,557
Scott: So when this Kickstarter appears I might even kick.

73
00:05:11,321 --> 00:05:15,934
Scott: I haven't read or watched a hentai and like Ever I have some.

74
00:05:15,955 --> 00:05:21,190
Rym: maybe I have a bunch of the old Steve Bennett stuff that was given to me at a convention long ago.

75
00:05:21,351 --> 00:05:26,415
Scott: But it's like, you know, I'll buy a copy of legend of the overfeed in English Piece of anime history.

76
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,158
Scott: Yeah, why not?

77
00:05:27,258 --> 00:05:29,606
Rym: He's a manga history, I guess nothing wrong with that.

78
00:05:30,007 --> 00:05:30,749
Rym: I don't know.

79
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:38,097
Rym: actually in Japan if Anyone particularly remembers legend of the overfeed Imagine not.

80
00:05:38,218 --> 00:05:38,762
Rym: I feel like it's.

81
00:05:38,782 --> 00:05:52,309
Rym: maybe I could be wrong But I imagine not because I know like there's a bunch of British anime fans way back told us that basically in the UK That was a lot of people from our generation like their introduction to anime and anime was like Japanese porn.

82
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:56,250
Scott: Cartoons just happened to be like the first tent I had that someone brought over.

83
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:01,430
Rym: Yeah, we had like a lotos war is not really that good But that was one of the first anime on TV.

84
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:03,710
Rym: It might have been the first anime on DVD in the US.

85
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,075
Rym: So a lot of people buy.

86
00:06:05,095 --> 00:06:11,930
Scott: I think the first anime DVD was if I'm not mistaken the legend not Lodos war OVA DVD.

87
00:06:12,332 --> 00:06:29,849
Rym: I'm almost certain that is the case because I remember being a kid Trying to convince my parents to buy one of the like eight hundred to a thousand dollar DVD players that were fancy and new Because I saw that the box set of lotos war was like 90 bucks on DVD And that shit was way more than 90 bucks if you bought all those VHS.

88
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:40,284
Scott: I remember all those VHS tapes like all the red VHS tapes that were lined up in a big row of lotos TV and like Every even even you know, not nerdy stores and it was just like whoa.

89
00:06:40,324 --> 00:06:40,786
Scott: What is that?

90
00:06:40,806 --> 00:06:42,170
Scott: It's some fantasy anime thing.

91
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,658
Scott: Well, I can't afford all that.

92
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,307
Scott: Yeah, I'm a high school kid.

93
00:06:45,327 --> 00:06:52,630
Rym: a lot of anime I would have watched younger than I didn't because I saw how many VHS tapes there were at 2499 a pop for two to four episodes.

94
00:06:53,672 --> 00:07:06,710
Rym: so in less Exciting news Funimation all-around good anime company Apparently has found a sinking ship and is desperately swimming out toward it to make camp.

95
00:07:07,372 --> 00:07:13,710
Rym: For whatever reason Funimation is launching an anime focused cable TV network.

96
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:14,574
Scott: But we already had.

97
00:07:14,694 --> 00:07:16,843
Scott: they already tried the anime network and it failed.

98
00:07:16,923 --> 00:07:20,659
Scott: and they came an on-demand Network, which I don't even know why.

99
00:07:20,719 --> 00:07:21,804
Scott: who still watches that?

100
00:07:21,844 --> 00:07:23,090
Rym: or anime network in today?

101
00:07:23,533 --> 00:07:25,670
Scott: It's making some kind of money because it still exists.

102
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:31,986
Rym: It's a 480i resolution video on-demand service that basically I can't imagine.

103
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:37,223
Scott: anyone who would use the anime network Unless they don't have internet must be making more money than it cost to run it.

104
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,370
Scott: So cuz it still exists, right?

105
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:44,284
Scott: Yeah, but why would you go back and try to do the full network again?

106
00:07:44,304 --> 00:07:46,270
Rym: I mean anime itself.

107
00:07:46,471 --> 00:07:51,810
Rym: I don't think there's a self-sustaining ecosystem of pure anime like anime fans.

108
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:54,358
Rym: This is for you and only you are.

109
00:07:54,378 --> 00:07:58,852
Scott: they gonna like just show anime or they also gonna produce new shows that are anime Related.

110
00:07:59,052 --> 00:08:00,417
Rym: looks like they're just gonna license anime.

111
00:08:00,457 --> 00:08:08,929
Rym: as far as I can tell they're not gonna make shows like quote from a tonight Or quote from the seat Mike the COO of Funimation anime world order TV.

112
00:08:09,331 --> 00:08:20,850
Rym: We're committed to making it easy to discover and connect with anime and our new cable channel will provide the best in anime entertainment that Fans have come to expect I mean to Nami can't even sustain can only sustain like a little bit of anime each week.

113
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:26,750
Rym: This will not make it easy to discover and connect with anime because Hulu already exists let alone crunchyroll.

114
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:39,977
Scott: So and also I guess if you're somewhere with the TV on and you're flipping through the channels You'll be able to put on this and it will be less bad than what the young people don't pay for cable anymore And they're not good this Anime to old people.

115
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,549
Rym: but they won't because old people won't go to the anime network.

116
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:51,116
Rym: The only way to get people who don't already know about Hulu and crunchyroll to be able to see anime is to put anime on The networks they already watch.

117
00:08:51,136 --> 00:08:56,497
Scott: I mean the Hasbro channel with the ponies couldn't even hold, you know hold Yeah, the hub did not succeed either.

118
00:08:56,758 --> 00:08:58,684
Scott: So why would this succeed?

119
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:01,252
Rym: I know if I was gonna do this What are they thinking?

120
00:09:02,315 --> 00:09:06,666
Rym: I would make and a cartoon network that actually showed nothing but cartoons.

121
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:08,510
Scott: I would.

122
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:09,432
Rym: that's what I would do.

123
00:09:09,453 --> 00:09:20,628
Rym: it would that we would have the pony all the Hasbro type stuff and Anime and other animation and I'd hire like anime world order and make them just do a fucking morning show about animation.

124
00:09:20,648 --> 00:09:23,930
Rym: I hire a bunch of Warner Brothers shit.

125
00:09:24,412 --> 00:09:28,505
Scott: if I had Disney everything I've had a TV network.

126
00:09:28,545 --> 00:09:30,532
Scott: I would run it like a completely normal TV network.

127
00:09:30,632 --> 00:09:32,740
Scott: only my news would be real fucking news.

128
00:09:33,321 --> 00:09:39,500
Scott: You know all the people that all the personalities that appeared on my network would you know give people the real deal not some bullshit.

129
00:09:39,801 --> 00:09:51,977
Scott: You know watered down for TV nonsense and I'd show what I thought were the best shows being produced that I could get Regardless of whether they were what country they were from or you know what type of show.

130
00:09:51,997 --> 00:09:53,304
Rym: that's just what amazes me Like what.

131
00:09:53,365 --> 00:09:54,939
Rym: there's so many things wrong with this one.

132
00:09:55,341 --> 00:09:57,489
Rym: It's cable TV, which is dying like.

133
00:09:57,529 --> 00:10:00,580
Rym: we almost talked about that on Monday, but we didn't because it's so obvious.

134
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:02,987
Rym: So they're going to a sinking medium.

135
00:10:03,047 --> 00:10:04,531
Scott: I don't know what like what is there?

136
00:10:04,551 --> 00:10:06,577
Scott: did they say what their strategy is?

137
00:10:06,677 --> 00:10:12,920
Rym: No, okay Renewed focus on delivering fans the best selection of anime content in the market.

138
00:10:13,302 --> 00:10:17,160
Rym: Okay, I mean, yeah, I guess you'll have the best selection of anime in the cable TV market.

139
00:10:17,422 --> 00:10:19,700
Rym: Sure go nuts, but so but it's bad.

140
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:30,778
Rym: It's weird because they're going to network like well network cable TV, but it's also weird because it's anime exclusive Which defeats any of the benefits you get from being on network cable TV?

141
00:10:31,934 --> 00:10:33,423
Rym: So Whatever.

142
00:10:33,483 --> 00:10:37,400
Rym: I just I don't understand how the anime industry even exists in America.

143
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:47,060
Scott: Sometimes they should spend their money like just on PR so that they get the same amount of coverage You know equal to their popularity in you know, the regular existing media.

144
00:10:47,141 --> 00:10:49,866
Scott: Yeah Just hire PR people with that money.

145
00:10:49,907 --> 00:10:50,228
Scott: don't hire

146
00:10:50,268 --> 00:10:58,978
Rym: PR people and get like shows that have mass appeal like just show redline On a network that shows other crazy movies like show aliens and then redline

147
00:10:58,998 --> 00:11:04,080
Scott: just market You know paint that money from marketing some market to people who aren't anime fans to grow the pie.

148
00:11:05,263 --> 00:11:06,860
Rym: So yeah, this is just kind of weird.

149
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,525
Rym: They haven't even announced any details.

150
00:11:08,565 --> 00:11:16,614
Rym: funimation plans to announce further details on the funimation channels relaunch soon So I guess we'll be able to say more then.

151
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:17,841
Rym: even worse You know what?

152
00:11:17,861 --> 00:11:19,709
Rym: This article says that what they said quote.

153
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:26,296
Rym: while we finalize the new channel for launch next year I encourage viewers to subscribe to our streaming service now at funimation comm.

154
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:30,439
Rym: so Why would I subscribe to one if I had the other?

155
00:11:33,642 --> 00:11:35,648
Scott: Why would you have cable if you have it?

156
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:39,220
Rym: Yeah, why would I have cable full stop if you have internet?

157
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,975
Rym: Okay, so interestingly enough just because I'm on there could be a place on where you can.

158
00:11:44,055 --> 00:11:50,220
Rym: you can't get really fast internet But you can still get cable comic book calm which is where I'm gonna link to for this because that's just the article I had.

159
00:11:50,622 --> 00:11:52,089
Rym: There's four comments on the article.

160
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:54,340
Rym: The first one is broadcast one piece and I'll subscribe.

161
00:11:54,822 --> 00:11:59,420
Rym: Okay, the next one is I wish there'd be a network devoted to comic book programming.

162
00:12:00,002 --> 00:12:03,032
Rym: Okay, the third one is an ass spam ad.

163
00:12:03,052 --> 00:12:06,596
Rym: All right, and the fourth one is Saying what we just said.

164
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,709
Rym: Okay, and also said something about to Nami.

165
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,515
Rym: prove that no one cares of watching anime on TV.

166
00:12:11,535 --> 00:12:16,332
Scott: Well that says more about the Community of comic book calm than it says about.

167
00:12:16,593 --> 00:12:29,594
Rym: Yeah, you know, yep Oh the guy who wants us to brought them to broadcast one piece has a luffy avatar in his Count that he made on comic book calm to respond to articles like this one.

168
00:12:30,396 --> 00:12:31,760
Rym: Who runs comic book calm?

169
00:12:32,702 --> 00:12:35,540
Scott: Someone who got a really good domain name and is just trying to me.

170
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,164
Rym: I'm just like I know it's much money with.

171
00:12:37,265 --> 00:12:40,133
Rym: so it's got TV movies comics games.

172
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:42,640
Scott: It's just a generic content scrapie site.

173
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,347
Scott: It's probably not where that article came from.

174
00:12:44,367 --> 00:12:45,713
Scott: It's yeah original content.

175
00:12:46,095 --> 00:12:48,702
Rym: This is just interesting Whatever.

176
00:12:48,803 --> 00:12:49,345
Scott: It's interesting.

177
00:12:49,365 --> 00:12:50,650
Scott: There's a content scrapie site.

178
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:51,372
Scott: Welcome to internet.

179
00:12:51,392 --> 00:12:52,416
Scott: There's like 10 million of them.

180
00:12:52,717 --> 00:12:53,400
Rym: There's fascinating.

181
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:58,420
Rym: It's like when you explore a rundown city somewhere in the middle of Detroit like yeah, you know, there's rundown cities.

182
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,938
Rym: But it's interesting to actually walk down some alleys and see what's back there.

183
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:09,509
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

184
00:13:10,563 --> 00:13:17,889
Rym: As you know I generally take a dim view of the sort of hyper live streams that people do about video games the whole markiplier or whatever.

185
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,690
Rym: but This live stream is actually worth watching.

186
00:13:23,495 --> 00:13:25,550
Rym: So this is a dude in Japan.

187
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:30,770
Rym: It's a Japanese guy who just live streams minecraft stuff in the usual fashion.

188
00:13:31,272 --> 00:13:34,086
Rym: But this particular video is him kind of.

189
00:13:34,187 --> 00:13:34,850
Rym: as an aside.

190
00:13:35,311 --> 00:13:51,649
Rym: he has this weird sort of like permanent match lighter that is not a use is trying to use it and over the course of these 11 minutes and 42 seconds he manages to start multiple fires and Burn his entire house down.

191
00:13:52,473 --> 00:13:53,680
Rym: Live on the internet.

192
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,524
Scott: don't smoke kids.

193
00:13:55,006 --> 00:14:09,959
Rym: What makes this particularly funny but also tragic is the way that this happens because he had like Seven opportunities to prevent this from occurring and there is a beautiful moment When he starts a fire.

194
00:14:10,662 --> 00:14:15,809
Rym: in the process of trying to put that fire out He starts a second fire behind himself that he does not notice.

195
00:14:16,352 --> 00:14:26,110
Rym: Meanwhile, he has this plug-in I guess where anyone who messages him from his live stream this Hatsune Miku sounding voice will read the message out loud.

196
00:14:26,703 --> 00:14:32,367
Rym: so The at one point the fire starts behind him and then you hear this anime will go.

197
00:14:32,387 --> 00:14:32,447
Rym: Wha?

198
00:14:35,848 --> 00:14:37,042
Rym: I Suggest you watch the whole thing.

199
00:14:37,103 --> 00:14:38,213
Rym: Don't skip ahead It's not.

200
00:14:38,273 --> 00:14:46,322
Scott: if it wasn't for the vocaloid reading the chat out loud Video wouldn't be any good But I'd really watch the whole thing because you will.

201
00:14:46,363 --> 00:14:52,130
Rym: there are many Chekhov's guns just waiting to fire Like the fact that he never tips the ashes out of his cigarette.

202
00:14:52,311 --> 00:15:00,949
Rym: so the ashes are getting longer and longer and longer the whole time and The video is just depressing and amazing and everything all together at once.

203
00:15:02,772 --> 00:15:05,210
Scott: All right, so I'm sure everyone saw this on the internet the other day.

204
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:08,165
Scott: But anyway, I just let you know in case you missed it.

205
00:15:08,205 --> 00:15:09,170
Scott: You're living under a rock.

206
00:15:09,772 --> 00:15:14,130
Scott: So id software, you know, they made Wolfenstein 3d then doom then quake then garbage.

207
00:15:16,632 --> 00:15:26,956
Scott: You know, there was John Carmack and John Romero the two John's right the important dudes who you know There's a lot of other important people there, but mostly the important dudes Those are the most well-known people.

208
00:15:26,977 --> 00:15:39,690
Scott:  yeah, and before they made the Wolfenstein 3d They made another game called commander keen and commander keen Was notable because it was just an MS-DOS platforming game and it's pretty good the series if you ever want to play it.

209
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:44,049
Rym: It was often installed on like PCs in schools so you could kind of just play it.

210
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:52,070
Scott: Yeah, but it was one of the first if not the first PC game that had full all directions smooth scrolling.

211
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:54,056
Scott: now That's a big deal because on those primitive.

212
00:15:54,437 --> 00:15:55,822
Scott: Well now we consider them primitive.

213
00:15:55,882 --> 00:16:00,355
Scott: on those old computers even like 386 is Scrolling smoothly.

214
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,306
Scott: It was not an easy thing to do.

215
00:16:02,386 --> 00:16:05,925
Scott: even on the NES Which was sort of designed for it was sort of tricky to do.

216
00:16:06,106 --> 00:16:06,347
Scott: right.

217
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:08,254
Scott: the Atari I don't think even could do it.

218
00:16:08,455 --> 00:16:09,478
Scott: I guess pitfall right.

219
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:11,425
Scott: people didn't scroll one screen at a time.

220
00:16:11,445 --> 00:16:14,748
Scott: Yeah, it doesn't even scroll but anyway.

221
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:22,050
Scott: So apparently before they made commander keen, you know, but they had developed the smooth scrolling already.

222
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:26,769
Scott: They sent to Nintendo a demo they made when they weren't even called id software.

223
00:16:26,789 --> 00:16:35,089
Scott: yet They were called ideas from the deep which I guess became id later for ideas deep, you know Whatever They made a demo.

224
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:40,650
Scott: It was pretty much just a direct copy of Mario 3 as best they could for the PC and they send it to Nintendo.

225
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:54,868
Scott: We're like, hey, let us make a PC version of Mario 3 and Nintendo's like, yeah We're not interested in putting Nintendo games in anything but Nintendo Which shows you how far game at least game wise the console NES was ahead of PC.

226
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,817
Scott: Of course NES couldn't do anything else.

227
00:16:57,078 --> 00:17:07,036
Rym: Yeah, but the NES was ahead of every Entertainment system in the world when it came out right even though it came out contemporarily to the Atari 7800.

228
00:17:07,036 --> 00:17:13,101
Scott: also consider that you know the mario 3. in the cartridge There was a lot more advanced chips than we're in say the mario 1 cartridge.

229
00:17:13,462 --> 00:17:13,683
Scott: Yep.

230
00:17:14,084 --> 00:17:14,566
Rym: That is true.

231
00:17:15,108 --> 00:17:25,236
Scott: But anyway the So here he released just the other day in honor of the anniversary of something Um Commander Kean's 25th anniversary.

232
00:17:25,256 --> 00:17:29,570
Scott: He uploaded video footage of that mario 3 that they made all those years ago.

233
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:36,390
Scott: So it's like a historic, you know video of game, you know, very important game history video here for you to watch.

234
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,714
Rym: you know, there's gonna be already.

235
00:17:37,815 --> 00:17:44,270
Rym: there will be a future when kids will go to a museum because their parents make them and In the museum be one of those corners.

236
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:50,530
Rym: They play it like a short film on a loop and that film will be this game and a little history of like.

237
00:17:50,791 --> 00:18:01,276
Scott: Nintendo was a company that made game and the big NES Comparison next to it showing you how the MS-DOS computer was so primitive compared to the what the NES could do But also explaining the reasons.

238
00:18:01,377 --> 00:18:04,848
Scott: and you know, the NES couldn't couldn't run Mac or your -.

239
00:18:04,868 --> 00:18:09,507
Rym: yeah Yes, any s could kind of share.

240
00:18:09,528 --> 00:18:13,384
Rym: yeah In the moment book club to be determined.

241
00:18:13,504 --> 00:18:14,750
Rym: The old book club is the wheel of time.

242
00:18:15,232 --> 00:18:21,029
Rym: We have two panels about three panels that PAX South two of which we can announce Atari game design designing game rules.

243
00:18:22,052 --> 00:18:22,814
Rym: We're gonna be at magfest.

244
00:18:22,855 --> 00:18:27,010
Rym: I'm like seven panels and everything else is coming up after the holidays.

245
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:36,378
Scott: I actually remember having some Capcom games for DOS back in the day Super Street Fighter 2 and also Megaman X And they were both super legit.

246
00:18:36,398 --> 00:18:38,424
Scott: Like just the same as the real deal.

247
00:18:38,665 --> 00:18:49,969
Rym: I remember in elementary school 486 in elementary school having a Megaman that ran on the PC at the school that someone had installed But it didn't work very well.

248
00:18:50,532 --> 00:18:53,443
Scott: No one can make a man X for DOS was basically totally legit.

249
00:18:53,523 --> 00:18:55,170
Scott: Megaman X as far as I remember now.

250
00:18:55,511 --> 00:19:03,863
Rym: So every year the IFC shows pretty much all the the Ghibli movies Just on in a movie theater in New York City.

251
00:19:03,883 --> 00:19:05,310
Scott: That's what you get when you live in New York City.

252
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:08,603
Rym: So every year every year we pick like two or three of them.

253
00:19:08,623 --> 00:19:10,049
Rym: Just go see him because why not?

254
00:19:10,611 --> 00:19:11,657
Rym: It's great to see these movies.

255
00:19:11,677 --> 00:19:12,361
Scott: No, I haven't.

256
00:19:12,421 --> 00:19:12,944
Scott: I didn't see.

257
00:19:12,964 --> 00:19:13,970
Scott: I mean I didn't do it last year.

258
00:19:16,272 --> 00:19:17,618
Scott: I haven't done it before ever.

259
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,527
Scott: I mean, I've seen I've seen new ones.

260
00:19:19,547 --> 00:19:20,210
Scott: when they come out.

261
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:21,797
Rym: I'd I do it every year.

262
00:19:21,817 --> 00:19:22,781
Rym: You don't always come with me.

263
00:19:22,801 --> 00:19:23,846
Scott: What did you see last year?

264
00:19:23,866 --> 00:19:24,710
Rym: I don't remember.

265
00:19:25,872 --> 00:19:26,836
Rym: No, I think we went to see my.

266
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:27,881
Rym: we saw Mononoke again.

267
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:29,730
Rym: Okay, because I really like that one.

268
00:19:29,911 --> 00:19:33,649
Scott: But anyway, I saw the news story that this is happening and I and then I realized you know what?

269
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:35,718
Scott: Haven't seen love to in like.

270
00:19:35,778 --> 00:19:37,630
Scott: I saw it once and I hardly remember it.

271
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:52,283
Scott: All I remembered was there's a castle in the sky is a cool robot as a magic girl with a necklace with a Jimmy there's some mining town there's a kid who's the main character and There's the bad pirate people who are also funny and good pirate people.

272
00:19:52,303 --> 00:19:54,350
Scott: and that's all I remembered and that was all accurate.

273
00:19:54,865 --> 00:19:58,180
Scott: but Upon watching it again, which we did yesterday.

274
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:04,452
Scott: I forgot 90% of this movie So I'm real glad I watched it again to remember that other 90%.

275
00:20:04,452 --> 00:20:17,269
Rym: I remembered pretty much everything that happens in the movie But what I did not remember was how much backstory there was told purely in the backgrounds of the movie.

276
00:20:18,193 --> 00:20:20,562
Rym: Like that I did not remember this movie

277
00:20:20,602 --> 00:20:32,330
Scott: and the very opening credits of the movie There's basically these background images that don't really move They're just backgrounds behind the credits and they tell you the whole history of like humanity in this world of LAPTA and what happened and how?

278
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:36,043
Scott: They polluted the earth and then they to escape the polluted earth.

279
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:47,130
Scott: with their advanced industrial technology they made floating cities in the sky like covering the whole earth and floating cities and buildings and then They am play gods and all the dollars happened, right?

280
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,530
Scott: All of them were destroyed and they had to return to the earth.

281
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:56,636
Scott: But the pollution was mostly gone, but not completely by then because you don't see like, you know Super many trees on the ground.

282
00:20:56,677 --> 00:21:00,910
Rym: you see some well, you know, it might not necessarily be that they're also in a mining area.

283
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:15,226
Rym: It is equally easy to say that that was just a class stratification of society built up the god People with their empire living up in the sky with the technology War and me and play God and the city's crashed down and try gun style.

284
00:21:15,266 --> 00:21:24,029
Scott: people have to rebuild society but it's been 700 years and people have basically forgotten about that that there ever was this sky society.

285
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:26,135
Scott: and You know, it's almost.

286
00:21:26,155 --> 00:21:27,080
Scott: it's a legend, right?

287
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,170
Scott: It's like a myth that like oh, yeah is a floating city.

288
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,196
Scott: Haha, not really.

289
00:21:30,296 --> 00:21:32,610
Scott: No only a few people believe in that most people don't.

290
00:21:33,531 --> 00:21:41,831
Rym: So in terms of the movie itself though, I mean, it's a 1986 Ghibli I have a feeling 1986 looks better than most animes from 1990 to 2000.

291
00:21:41,831 --> 00:21:45,240
Rym: Yeah, this movie is beautiful and holds up what.

292
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:50,956
Rym: the only thing that does not hold up having watched it again in the theater Soundtrack is not great.

293
00:21:51,037 --> 00:21:52,061
Scott: You don't like the soundtrack.

294
00:21:52,322 --> 00:21:54,090
Rym: I like half the soundtrack.

295
00:21:54,251 --> 00:21:57,630
Scott: So the thing with the soundtrack is that it's you know, it's the same as Joe Hisaishi.

296
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,297
Scott: Whatever who does all the Ghibli?

297
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:02,210
Scott: Yeah, most the vast majority of the Ghibli music, right?

298
00:22:02,853 --> 00:22:04,922
Scott: And you know, it's really catchy.

299
00:22:05,002 --> 00:22:17,181
Scott: some of the songs I should the main song But the thing is is that for better or worse it really Seems like Nobuo Matsu did the music.

300
00:22:17,421 --> 00:22:19,268
Scott: Yeah, it's like it's real.

301
00:22:19,389 --> 00:22:19,770
Scott: the plot.

302
00:22:19,951 --> 00:22:21,277
Scott: Also, it's very fun.

303
00:22:21,317 --> 00:22:30,769
Scott: Like you could it's almost like they took a Final Fantasy plot You know really squished it down to fit in 90 minutes and took out a lot of like the side characters and stuff.

304
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:37,770
Scott: and You know, just put it on the screen and it a lot of the music and scenes feel like Final Fantasy.

305
00:22:38,452 --> 00:22:48,790
Scott: very much more specific criticism like that bad guy is basically kefka and The girl is like, you know, what's her face from the magic girl you meet at the beginning?

306
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:50,635
Rym: You don't remember any of those characters names.

307
00:22:50,655 --> 00:22:50,916
Rym: Do you?

308
00:22:51,056 --> 00:22:53,043
Scott: well, I'd rename them all Tara.

309
00:22:53,364 --> 00:22:53,605
Scott: Okay.

310
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:56,856
Scott: Yeah, so the girls basically Tara You know, whatever.

311
00:22:57,337 --> 00:23:14,444
Rym: so my specific issue is that half the soundtrack is orchestral or vocal or normal instruments and sounds like a score like a musical score and the other half is Synthesizers going doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.

312
00:23:14,464 --> 00:23:18,047
Scott: I kind of like that sound but yes, it's not the better It's a lower quality sound.

313
00:23:18,108 --> 00:23:23,530
Scott: now I can make an argument and it's that's why it's also contributes to the Final Fantasy sounding nature of it.

314
00:23:23,911 --> 00:23:36,458
Rym: I can make an argument as to why the soundtrack has this very stark dichotomy because the Soundscape kind of does something similar, but I cannot say that Joe hishaishi Did that on purpose.

315
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:56,441
Rym: the argument I would make if I was in like AP video and film and was trying to write a short essay on it is that all the motifs around the precursor technology and Lop to itself and the triant like all that stuff is refined and elegant and uses normal instruments and is normal orchestral music.

316
00:23:57,885 --> 00:24:12,210
Rym: all the fighting and Industrial and like current society sounds are all those sort of grading synthesizer unrefined Sort of like not there yet like they're unrefined and raw and industrializing.

317
00:24:13,415 --> 00:24:14,550
Rym: That's the best I could come up with.

318
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:14,651
Rym: I

319
00:24:14,691 --> 00:24:16,542
Scott: wasn't paying attention to know if that's actually true or

320
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:35,010
Rym: soundtrack is very rough When like the normal people are fighting and doing their thing and the soundtrack is very smooth only went and smooth and elegant only either when Lop is coming up or When the spirit of humanity and the like very simple non confrontational background scenes are happening.

321
00:24:35,995 --> 00:24:37,009
Scott: I don't know if that's true or not.

322
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:39,919
Scott: I had to like watch it again and like with notes to figure that out.

323
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:48,599
Rym: all the machines make very odd Sounds as well Like the sounds that the machine like the flying machines make are.

324
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,766
Rym: just you have to watch the movie like they're.

325
00:24:50,806 --> 00:24:52,170
Rym: they're odd sound effects.

326
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:55,480
Rym: yeah, of course the wind rises does something very similar.

327
00:24:55,540 --> 00:25:01,290
Rym: the sounds that the planes make are very Very weird as I think we talked about when we did the review of that movie.

328
00:25:02,555 --> 00:25:06,170
Scott: You know, I mean in general it's still a really great jibbly movie.

329
00:25:06,511 --> 00:25:13,382
Scott: You know the plot isn't complicated and it's really straightforward and but I really love you know Terrible secret of space like is there a lot of it?

330
00:25:13,503 --> 00:25:14,206
Scott: obviously there is.

331
00:25:14,226 --> 00:25:14,950
Scott: they're gonna go there.

332
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:20,510
Scott: Oh, they went there, but like it's not one of those things were like they go there at the end and they leave it being mysterious.

333
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:27,255
Scott: It's like they get there and then they spend a lot of time there before the movies over and you pretty much learn everything There is to learn about it.

334
00:25:27,576 --> 00:25:29,766
Scott: You know, they reveal the full secret of space.

335
00:25:30,027 --> 00:25:30,810
Scott: They show you everything.

336
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:39,117
Rym: The movie has a very epic feel to it And I think part of that is because it is a full two hours plus But I mean it as the only.

337
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:41,910
Scott: that's sort of weird though because it escalates too quickly, right?

338
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:51,773
Scott: It's like girl falls out of the sky meets the main character kid And then it just takes off like through the roof and it the progression is a little bit Exponential

339
00:25:51,873 --> 00:25:52,315
Rym: I think to

340
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:56,392
Scott: the point where it's a little hard to believe suddenly like really that quickly you're see.

341
00:25:56,632 --> 00:26:07,290
Rym: I would make a counter-argument that the the story of La Pita and I think the movie is Moderately unique because there aren't that many films that do this to the extent that La Pita did anime or otherwise.

342
00:26:07,792 --> 00:26:10,722
Rym: There is a huge epic like Tolkien.

343
00:26:10,882 --> 00:26:36,584
Rym: ask volumes of this giant multi-generational Wheel of Time nonsense epic story and That whole story is told to you through Individual things that you see in the background of this movie Like little bits like the miners are all mining in this place in the beginning and then as the camera zooms back you realize that Hey They're in the middle of all these Abandoned mines from the old days like all the.

344
00:26:36,684 --> 00:26:39,260
Rym: all these buildings are abandoned These are old mines.

345
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:45,490
Rym: and then you get the impression Oh, they're mining there because they assume these old mines had something in them and they can't find anything.

346
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:46,497
Rym: There's nothing valuable.

347
00:26:46,537 --> 00:26:48,329
Rym: so they don't understand why these mines are there.

348
00:26:48,811 --> 00:26:51,663
Rym: But then you learn from the old dude that there is stuff there.

349
00:26:51,703 --> 00:26:53,390
Rym: The volisite is everywhere.

350
00:26:53,651 --> 00:26:56,783
Scott: They just don't recognize it or know how to use it exactly.

351
00:26:56,803 --> 00:27:01,749
Scott: even people back in the olden days though Who weren't La Pita might have known what it was and didn't know how to you know.

352
00:27:02,573 --> 00:27:11,546
Rym: And if you just watch in the background you see like civilization is like Clinging to the edges of all these old abandoned things and sort of even after 700 years.

353
00:27:11,586 --> 00:27:12,770
Scott: They've figured out a bunch, right?

354
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:18,737
Scott: They can fly again and they do all it but they haven't figured out Nearly close to everything that used to exist.

355
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:20,081
Scott: and that's always the best.

356
00:27:20,121 --> 00:27:23,030
Scott: the fantasy world where is the existing freaker zero?

357
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:27,718
Rym: It's like the lock Lamora thing Which is especially highlighted when they get to La Pita.

358
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:32,774
Rym: and then there's the scenes in the end where the weapon systems get activated and then it's like.

359
00:27:32,875 --> 00:27:40,017
Rym: it's like a player of games where yes, the lot the La Putin technology is So far beyond.

360
00:27:40,339 --> 00:27:50,174
Scott: I mean it takes down that battlecruiser in like the battle So is presented as like the biggest scariest most dangerous thing that the you know, existing human society is Military technology.

361
00:27:50,234 --> 00:27:51,679
Scott: and it isn't even like.

362
00:27:51,699 --> 00:27:53,084
Scott: it's not even like a contest.

363
00:27:53,144 --> 00:27:54,670
Scott: It's just like robots boom done.

364
00:27:54,919 --> 00:28:00,589
Scott: Yeah It's like and you know there isn't even Suspense as to whether it's gonna be a contest because the power of lava is so great.

365
00:28:01,232 --> 00:28:04,502
Rym: He drops the nuke and he's like, oh, yeah, I can nuke too.

366
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:10,890
Scott: Yeah, the one robot that they captured That's like broken that wakes up and oh that destroys like the whole castle.

367
00:28:11,251 --> 00:28:15,925
Scott: It's missing a hand and a foot and it destroys the entire castle on its own.

368
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:24,270
Rym: and it's barely even trying And you know holding back in a lot of media of having like really seeing that tech disconnect right there.

369
00:28:24,772 --> 00:28:31,402
Rym: But that is the client like the pinnacle of this huge story That's just told through little background bits little things.

370
00:28:31,462 --> 00:28:38,910
Rym: The main character the girl says little Insights you get from old people in the books and the sky and the guy who should be king and all that nonsense.

371
00:28:39,192 --> 00:28:44,370
Rym: Yeah, but the actual story of the movie Starts in media res kind of like giant robo.

372
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:44,651
Rym: I mean.

373
00:28:44,671 --> 00:28:50,530
Rym: it starts with the girl was already kidnapped and you don't know who the bad guys are and then there's a chase and All that stuff happens right away.

374
00:28:50,610 --> 00:29:00,909
Rym: So it starts in the middle of that epic story and it basically shows you the end of that epic story Like the very end when the last castle in the sky falls down.

375
00:29:02,291 --> 00:29:07,767
Scott: Spoilers, I guess What else is there to say about this besides?

376
00:29:07,867 --> 00:29:08,670
Scott: yeah, you should watch it.

377
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:16,634
Rym: I mean, I'm curious actually in the forum like how many of you you know your anime fans I assume if you listen to GeekNights, but If you guys actually seen this movie, yeah I don't want.

378
00:29:16,674 --> 00:29:18,712
Scott: it's not the best jibbly movie But it's like the.

379
00:29:19,013 --> 00:29:23,590
Scott: I think in terms of bestness to least watchness the thing has like the worst ratio easily.

380
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:28,830
Rym: I mean my opinion of this movie now that I've seen it again recently is a way higher than it was before.

381
00:29:29,252 --> 00:29:31,801
Scott: I remember really loving the hell out of it before.

382
00:29:31,861 --> 00:29:34,110
Scott: so my opinion my opinion level didn't really change.

383
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:35,989
Scott: I just forgot most of what happened in it.

384
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:41,237
Rym: But if you never like it like trust me when you watch this movie Pay more.

385
00:29:41,318 --> 00:29:43,129
Scott: you really need anyone to sell you this.

386
00:29:43,274 --> 00:29:51,450
Rym: No I'm just saying pay more attention to the backgrounds than the action because the backgrounds tell this really interesting story.

387
00:29:51,853 --> 00:29:57,190
Rym: But in terms of the action I This movie does something that Ghibli's did in the old days.

388
00:29:57,190 --> 00:30:04,784
Rym: They don't seem to do as much now, but it has this sort of like really light-hearted Like all in good fun violence.

389
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:05,830
Scott: Well, okay.

390
00:30:05,891 --> 00:30:11,904
Scott: So in the early part of the movie There's tons and tons of crazy action going on that lots of violence.

391
00:30:11,924 --> 00:30:13,830
Scott: the main character the kid almost dies.

392
00:30:14,553 --> 00:30:16,583
Scott: The opening scene is violent.

393
00:30:16,603 --> 00:30:24,450
Scott: this girl just falls off of you know Skyship and airship right and there's all kinds of guns and shooting right away But not as you know.

394
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:29,570
Scott: These pirates come and board the airship trying to kidnap her and steal the Jimmy firing cannons at each other.

395
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:34,550
Scott: He's the evil men in black or she or you assume her evil men in black as they kidnapped the girl to begin with.

396
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,514
Scott: They're shooting at the pirates.

397
00:30:35,555 --> 00:30:38,870
Scott: You're not sure which ones are good or bad, but the girls trying to escape everyone.

398
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:44,390
Scott: So you figure they're both bad right and they're shooting at each other, but no one gets hurt or dies.

399
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:50,545
Scott: Really it's you know in not in a permanent way and the movie continues to sort of keep that thing going.

400
00:30:50,585 --> 00:30:56,370
Scott: where people are like Do you know is avoiding what would normally be certain death?

401
00:30:56,670 --> 00:31:00,785
Rym: Like you know kid almost falls off a cliff just because he's fucking around like a time.

402
00:31:00,805 --> 00:31:03,394
Scott: Yeah, like Looney Tunes level We're like they're on a train.

403
00:31:03,555 --> 00:31:04,578
Scott: It's going really fast.

404
00:31:04,659 --> 00:31:11,044
Scott: The train tracks are collapsing right behind the train, but they're not falling You know, they almost fall off things like ten times.

405
00:31:11,064 --> 00:31:16,927
Scott: they managed to grab on Realistically and survive like a whole bunch of times like no one's getting hurt.

406
00:31:16,987 --> 00:31:17,630
Scott: No one's dying.

407
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:19,095
Scott: There's tons of fighting going on.

408
00:31:19,276 --> 00:31:24,773
Scott: the best fight whole town breaks out into a huge brawl when the pirate Take turns.

409
00:31:24,854 --> 00:31:28,367
Rym: punching each other in the stomach is one of my favorite scenes in this movie.

410
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:29,270
Scott: It's such a good scene.

411
00:31:29,371 --> 00:31:30,430
Rym: I should make a gif out of that.

412
00:31:30,691 --> 00:31:34,486
Scott: like no one no one gets permanently injured or dead or anything from any of this.

413
00:31:34,868 --> 00:31:49,606
Rym: and then Later in the movie suddenly, they're like they stop and they're like, well people are dying now But they animate it the same way except before They'd show like GI Joe like literally every soldier running out of a thing before it blows up.

414
00:31:49,967 --> 00:31:53,400
Rym: and then at the end of the movie they show Everyone died.

415
00:31:53,481 --> 00:31:54,368
Scott: Well, I just like boop.

416
00:31:54,550 --> 00:32:03,898
Scott: well I think what it is that if I'm not mistaken, you know all the only violence that kills people is Violence from lava to technology.

417
00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:07,690
Scott: I don't think human technology kills anyone in this movie, right?

418
00:32:08,031 --> 00:32:10,500
Rym: Well that violence of the lava technology it also.

419
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,667
Rym: it follows the men in sunglasses.

420
00:32:12,768 --> 00:32:14,639
Rym: the men in black there's like like there.

421
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:22,958
Rym: there's a certain level of Humanity in the normal people in the town and in the pirates but there isn't humanity in the men in black.

422
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:26,168
Rym: one of them's a labootin or whatever and the other ones are just toadies.

423
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:30,810
Rym: but The when they're involved there is real danger.

424
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:37,690
Rym: There's like this cold risk of death this other alien thing that is not present in the rest of society.

425
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:38,032
Rym: They can.

426
00:32:38,132 --> 00:32:41,169
Scott: they're apparently important enough to boss the army around and mess with the army.

427
00:32:41,571 --> 00:32:46,930
Scott: But and the army is way powerful, but the army is also portrayed as being way stupid because their general is like a doof.

428
00:32:47,752 --> 00:32:48,962
Rym: Yeah, that guy is pretty doofy.

429
00:32:49,103 --> 00:32:51,775
Rym: Yeah, of course They'd probably better off it.

430
00:32:51,815 --> 00:32:53,703
Rym: He had won than if the other guy had won.

431
00:32:54,346 --> 00:32:54,988
Scott: He was just looting.

432
00:32:55,028 --> 00:32:55,350
Scott: He wasn't.

433
00:32:58,665 --> 00:33:01,157
Rym: I Mean you're an anime fan.

434
00:33:01,177 --> 00:33:03,729
Rym: If you haven't seen this movie, you should a hundred percent go see it.

435
00:33:04,031 --> 00:33:07,084
Scott: I mean what pseudo Ghibli movie is not must-see anime.

436
00:33:07,104 --> 00:33:13,535
Scott: Ah Ocean why don't we do Studio Ghibli ranking?

437
00:33:13,796 --> 00:33:14,658
Rym: we should just sit down.

438
00:33:14,698 --> 00:33:17,065
Rym: We'll both sit and try now do right now.

439
00:33:17,306 --> 00:33:18,470
Rym: Yeah, let me pull up the list.

440
00:33:19,412 --> 00:33:20,600
Rym: All right, we both got the list up.

441
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,129
Rym: So I've seen almost all of these.

442
00:33:22,431 --> 00:33:24,930
Scott: I mean, we're mostly covering the major ones, right?

443
00:33:25,111 --> 00:33:26,136
Scott: I mean, we don't.

444
00:33:26,217 --> 00:33:28,549
Scott: I guess I haven't seen only yesterday.

445
00:33:29,691 --> 00:33:30,215
Rym: Let's see.

446
00:33:30,296 --> 00:33:32,150
Scott: This is the first one.

447
00:33:33,513 --> 00:33:36,812
Scott: It was the first one Love.

448
00:33:36,832 --> 00:33:38,900
Scott: it is the first Studio Ghibli full-length.

449
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,406
Rym: I was like only yesterday.

450
00:33:40,426 --> 00:33:41,029
Rym: Is it the first one?

451
00:33:41,109 --> 00:33:42,012
Rym: Oh, yeah It's the first one.

452
00:33:42,112 --> 00:33:44,179
Rym: Yeah, at least on the list of films.

453
00:33:44,339 --> 00:33:45,342
Scott: It's the first one.

454
00:33:46,084 --> 00:33:47,830
Rym: I like La Pita a lot.

455
00:33:48,258 --> 00:33:48,728
Scott: It's way up.

456
00:33:48,991 --> 00:33:54,090
Rym: It's hard to say though because I would have ranked La Pita much lower based on having seen it once a long time ago.

457
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:56,524
Rym: But now that I just saw it, I don't think it might.

458
00:33:56,544 --> 00:33:59,216
Scott: it's ranking is changing But I noticed a lot of things.

459
00:33:59,698 --> 00:34:04,398
Rym: I probably would have put it below Kiki's before but now I put it Significantly above Kiki's.

460
00:34:04,438 --> 00:34:06,430
Rym: but I have not seen Kiki's in a long time either.

461
00:34:06,631 --> 00:34:08,697
Scott: I seen Kiki's recently enough to remember.

462
00:34:08,717 --> 00:34:11,770
Scott: I think it might be equal that they're probably next to each other.

463
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:17,090
Rym: It's hard to say because Scott, you know precursor technology is my jam to a deep degree.

464
00:34:17,351 --> 00:34:21,070
Scott: I mean, I'm just evaluating the quality of the movie not my personal taste.

465
00:34:21,311 --> 00:34:28,578
Rym: So quality from like a cinematic like movie structure Spirited away might have to just win.

466
00:34:28,618 --> 00:34:36,649
Scott: that way is definitely I mean easy number one spirited away Is it if you're going from a purely like technical storytelling as an easy number one for me?

467
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:38,475
Scott: Yeah, I've seen it the most.

468
00:34:38,635 --> 00:34:41,004
Rym: also, you know, the wind rises has.

469
00:34:41,967 --> 00:34:42,750
Scott: I haven't seen that one.

470
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:52,668
Rym: I enjoyed deeply because it is so different from every other Miyazaki movie and is a very uncomfortable movie to watch very uncomfortable.

471
00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:54,893
Rym: Earthsea has to be the bottom.

472
00:34:55,155 --> 00:34:55,878
Scott: Earthsea is the bottom.

473
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:57,986
Rym: That movie was so awful.

474
00:34:58,006 --> 00:34:59,110
Scott: So Spirited Away is number one.

475
00:34:59,191 --> 00:35:03,541
Scott: Number two is a tough fight between Whisper of the Heart and Grave of the Fireflies.

476
00:35:03,742 --> 00:35:04,063
Rym: I don't know.

477
00:35:04,103 --> 00:35:05,430
Rym: I like Whispers of the Heart a lot.

478
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:07,270
Rym: I don't know if it's necessarily the greatest movie.

479
00:35:07,451 --> 00:35:09,521
Rym: I like it a lot for a lot of reasons.

480
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:16,333
Rym: Whisper of the Heart is so good But I also really like Porco Rosso despite the fact that it is flawed in a lot of ways Right.

481
00:35:16,354 --> 00:35:20,309
Scott: I mean, I like Porco Rosso a lot But that's gonna be a little bit lower than some of these other ones.

482
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:20,772
Rym: Why though?

483
00:35:20,812 --> 00:35:23,205
Rym: because quality chart from a like does Rym like it.

484
00:35:23,426 --> 00:35:25,074
Rym: it might be higher But from a like.

485
00:35:25,094 --> 00:35:30,314
Rym: Porco Rosso's story has a few issues and leaves a few threads not Sufficiently tied off in my.

486
00:35:30,334 --> 00:35:32,240
Scott: well, it doesn't make it a worse movie or anything.

487
00:35:32,741 --> 00:35:41,150
Scott: I might actually put Mononoke number two, though Mononoke's Mononoke is in the mix and in like the three slot with the castle in the sky.

488
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:43,516
Rym: Mononoke also has the complex narrative.

489
00:35:43,536 --> 00:35:44,558
Scott: The Totoro and the Kiki.

490
00:35:44,819 --> 00:35:52,155
Rym: Multiple characters and multiple sort of like competing factions that are all good and bad Simultaneously.

491
00:35:52,195 --> 00:35:53,424
Rym: like it's there is no.

492
00:35:53,505 --> 00:35:54,210
Rym: those are good guys.

493
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:55,133
Rym: These are bad guys.

494
00:35:55,213 --> 00:36:04,570
Scott: Lapida, Totoro, Kiki and Mononoke are like this four Fecta that are like all really equal And it's hard to separate them and they're all in like the three slot area.

495
00:36:05,172 --> 00:36:05,754
Scott: I would put.

496
00:36:05,815 --> 00:36:07,080
Scott: those are like the solid.

497
00:36:07,501 --> 00:36:16,890
Scott: what you expect from Ghibli movie You know Totally good way awesome, but I can't really find any way to like put one above the other.

498
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:21,470
Rym: I think I put Wind Rises and Grave of the Fireflies in the same category.

499
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:24,520
Scott: Well, I mean they're you know more serious subject matter.

500
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:27,410
Scott: Yeah, but I mean Grave of the Fireflies is so good.

501
00:36:27,591 --> 00:36:28,855
Scott: Yeah, I've seen Wind Rises.

502
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:32,709
Rym: Wind Rises is also very good, but it's artistic in a different way.

503
00:36:33,534 --> 00:36:36,030
Rym: Mmm, you need to see it and then we could talk about that more.

504
00:36:37,451 --> 00:36:38,716
Rym: The cat returns is just fun.

505
00:36:38,737 --> 00:36:40,845
Scott: Yeah, cat returns isn't that good.

506
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,956
Scott: I mean, it's not bad It's good, but it's not.

507
00:36:43,338 --> 00:36:45,974
Scott: it's not at the level of the foursome I just mentioned.

508
00:36:46,135 --> 00:36:48,850
Rym: would you put the cat returns at the same level as like Ponyo or Arrietty?

509
00:36:51,353 --> 00:36:56,549
Scott: I Think it might be just slightly under those just due to production value and such.

510
00:36:56,790 --> 00:37:02,408
Rym: Nah, you know, but Arrietty had way high production values and was good but flawed in a lot of ways.

511
00:37:02,689 --> 00:37:06,803
Scott: Ponyo Arrietty, you know house moving castle pretty similar.

512
00:37:06,843 --> 00:37:16,637
Rym: house moving castle might be a little bit better Yeah, but at the same time house moving castle ignoring books or any other media about it Not necessarily the best narrative.

513
00:37:16,918 --> 00:37:22,653
Scott: No, I think Porco Rosso goes in between the four-factor and the Ponyos and the Earthseas Right.

514
00:37:22,914 --> 00:37:28,255
Scott: It's sort of like right under the four-factor and then I Guess what's what are we missing here?

515
00:37:28,295 --> 00:37:31,405
Rym: So I have not seen Kaguya unfortunately, so I can't.

516
00:37:31,586 --> 00:37:32,670
Scott: Kaguya is really good.

517
00:37:34,372 --> 00:37:42,990
Scott: It might be better than the Arriettys and the Ponyos But underneath the Porco Rosso's I need to see it because everyone's going nuts about it.

518
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:44,296
Rym: But I saw song of the sea.

519
00:37:44,497 --> 00:37:54,630
Scott: the problem with princess Kaguya is that it's so good But the pacing of it is a bit slow towards the second half and it drags a bit and that really brings the whole thing down.

520
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:57,641
Scott: But you know the art and the story is so good.

521
00:37:57,681 --> 00:38:06,538
Rym: You know what from a filmmaking perspective I think when Marnie was there actually needs to be pretty high on the list because that might be like tied with the Porco Rosso's.

522
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:17,143
Rym: when Marnie was there set a really interesting level of tension and it but it wasn't like a Hitchcock movie tension, but I like it.

523
00:38:17,263 --> 00:38:23,070
Rym: I had this sense of dread throughout a lot of the movie because It misdirects you in a lot of ways as to what it's actually about.

524
00:38:23,331 --> 00:38:27,070
Scott: And I also had a slight pacing issue of slowness, but not as bad as Kaguya did.

525
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:34,330
Rym: Well the slowness and Marnie I think is also intentional to heighten the tension where you can't quite figure out what's going on.

526
00:38:34,891 --> 00:38:41,150
Scott: Yeah, I think I would definitely put Marnie above, you know, the the castle the Ponyo the Ariete.

527
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:46,414
Rym: yeah, I just Marnie was just a very well-constructed movie and Seeing it to the end.

528
00:38:46,494 --> 00:38:52,538
Rym: It reminds me of a lot of the old great just live-action movies I like from the 40s and 50s.

529
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,386
Scott: I didn't see Poppy Hill.

530
00:38:54,406 --> 00:38:57,913
Scott: I Didn't see Ocean waves.

531
00:38:58,053 --> 00:38:58,775
Rym: I saw Poppy Hill.

532
00:38:58,796 --> 00:39:00,200
Rym: Poppy Hill was pretty good, but it wasn't great.

533
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,063
Scott: I enjoyed it.

534
00:39:01,083 --> 00:39:02,266
Scott: I haven't seen my neighbors.

535
00:39:02,307 --> 00:39:04,548
Rym: the Yamada's Poppy Hill was.

536
00:39:05,751 --> 00:39:08,078
Rym: It has this moment where you think oh, that's the twist.

537
00:39:08,158 --> 00:39:11,990
Rym: Okay, and then oh, that's not the twist double twist.

538
00:39:13,291 --> 00:39:15,501
Scott: And you think are there any that I didn't see only yesterday?

539
00:39:15,521 --> 00:39:17,370
Scott: Is there anything else we didn't comment on?

540
00:39:18,532 --> 00:39:19,522
Scott: There's just about all of them.

541
00:39:19,704 --> 00:39:28,970
Scott: Yeah So yeah, yeah, if you haven't seen Lava to go see it I mean pretty much every I mean even though you know, we were just ranking them from best to worst.

542
00:39:29,971 --> 00:39:34,470
Scott: They're pretty much all worth watching one exception except for the Earthsea one.

543
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,099
Scott: so Don't watch the Earthsea one.

544
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:38,744
Scott: watch every other.

545
00:39:38,805 --> 00:39:39,470
Scott: one of these things.

546
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:42,889
Scott: Yeah, even the ones I haven't seen I can pretty confident that they're worth what?

547
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,240
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
