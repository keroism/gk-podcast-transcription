00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,530
Rym: It's Wednesday November 18th 2015.

2
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:16,640
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,673
Rym: descender Let's do this.

4
00:00:25,723 --> 00:00:30,096
Rym: So if you're listening to this it is already too late to get badges for paxies.

5
00:00:30,116 --> 00:00:31,520
Rym: that shit went live this morning.

6
00:00:31,661 --> 00:00:38,940
Rym: That's a shame and as of dateline 624 p.m.. Eastern Standard Time doing the show kind of early tonight.

7
00:00:39,905 --> 00:00:41,314
Rym: Of course three-day badges are sold out.

8
00:00:41,334 --> 00:00:42,260
Rym: there aren't that many of those.

9
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:43,728
Rym: Saturday is sold out.

10
00:00:43,788 --> 00:00:45,779
Rym: Saturday sold out within like five minutes.

11
00:00:46,445 --> 00:00:48,300
Rym: Friday and Sunday are almost sold out.

12
00:00:50,022 --> 00:00:59,940
Rym: This isn't news that paxi sells out immediately But the thing that you all need to pay attention to in the future is that many of you probably got badges.

13
00:01:00,343 --> 00:01:02,479
Rym: People who wanted badges mostly got them.

14
00:01:03,242 --> 00:01:08,120
Rym: But what people did not get her hotel rooms because there are not enough hotels in the city of Boston

15
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,100
Scott: You can stay on the other side of the city barely

16
00:01:10,383 --> 00:01:22,167
Rym: I clicked so I already had a hotel But I clicked when I as fast as I humanly could when the site went live to see in the queue like what hotel I could have gotten had.

17
00:01:22,227 --> 00:01:32,697
Rym: I not had my other way to get a hotel and Despite clicking within 30 or 40 seconds of it going live Literally the closest hotel I could get was like two miles away.

18
00:01:32,737 --> 00:01:33,600
Rym: on the other side of boss.

19
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,211
Scott: I'm saying on the other side you take a taxi every day.

20
00:01:36,231 --> 00:01:38,360
Scott: You gotta take that shuttle or the shuttle I.

21
00:01:39,721 --> 00:01:41,007
Rym: I couldn't deal with that at a PAX.

22
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:41,850
Rym: I don't do that for I don't.

23
00:01:41,891 --> 00:01:42,814
Rym: there's no convention.

24
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:43,558
Rym: I commute to.

25
00:01:43,578 --> 00:01:44,925
Scott: no It's not good times.

26
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:52,555
Rym: Yeah, so uh those of you complaining There is nothing to be done about that except don't try to get badges first.

27
00:01:53,077 --> 00:01:54,220
Rym: get your hotel first.

28
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,625
Rym: That's the secret with paxis.

29
00:01:55,927 --> 00:01:57,633
Rym: the hotel is the limiting quantity.

30
00:01:57,653 --> 00:01:59,380
Scott: Yeah, I mean it's like the ticket.

31
00:01:59,561 --> 00:02:01,192
Scott: It's like someone will be selling the ticket.

32
00:02:01,212 --> 00:02:04,289
Scott: you might have to pay a bunch of money But you can get one if you really want one.

33
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:06,380
Scott: you can get one by spending money.

34
00:02:06,722 --> 00:02:08,676
Scott: They'll be for sale usually at cost.

35
00:02:08,717 --> 00:02:14,695
Scott: the last Badges yeah, you can get them at cost usually from someone who can't go or something like that.

36
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:18,346
Scott: right, but the hotel How you gonna get a hotel room?

37
00:02:18,366 --> 00:02:19,008
Scott: You just can't.

38
00:02:19,169 --> 00:02:19,851
Scott: it's not like you.

39
00:02:19,871 --> 00:02:22,260
Scott: someone's reselling their hotel room that they already got right?

40
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,487
Rym: Yeah, I mean magfest is having that problem already.

41
00:02:24,547 --> 00:02:28,762
Rym: like air B&Bs are taken like there is no way to get a hotel room anymore Mm-hmm.

42
00:02:29,286 --> 00:02:33,554
Rym: so uh my other advice to you is Go to PAX South instead.

43
00:02:33,594 --> 00:02:38,696
Rym: unless you live in Boston It's cheaper to go to PAX South in Texas then to PAX East from.

44
00:02:38,756 --> 00:02:39,640
Scott: we live in New York.

45
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,787
Scott: It's way closer to Boston than San Antonio.

46
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:45,500
Scott: It was cheaper to go to San Antonio than it was to go to Boston.

47
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,837
Rym: Yeah, because a cella or like Amtrak or even the buses not that much cheaper.

48
00:02:50,857 --> 00:02:51,920
Scott: bull buses 20 bucks.

49
00:02:52,162 --> 00:02:54,238
Rym: Yeah, the bull bus not ideal.

50
00:02:54,258 --> 00:02:54,560
Rym: What's wrong?

51
00:02:55,521 --> 00:02:56,265
Rym: Takes forever.

52
00:02:56,546 --> 00:02:57,170
Scott: doesn't take that long.

53
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,034
Rym: It takes a while.

54
00:02:58,516 --> 00:02:59,220
Rym: I'll do the Amtrak.

55
00:02:59,381 --> 00:03:00,685
Rym: I'm never doing the buses again.

56
00:03:00,705 --> 00:03:03,113
Scott: The bus goes to the exact same place again.

57
00:03:03,153 --> 00:03:05,220
Rym: It takes like two plus more hours.

58
00:03:05,604 --> 00:03:06,758
Scott: Oh, no, I'll just leave earlier.

59
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:10,085
Rym: Yeah, plus I got.

60
00:03:10,306 --> 00:03:14,857
Rym: it's really more pleasant, but the hotels are like half the price.

61
00:03:15,118 --> 00:03:22,705
Rym: yeah, there's food Everywhere and you can still buy Friday Saturday or Sunday badges to PAX South Like you can totally like this.

62
00:03:22,745 --> 00:03:26,678
Rym: hotels within a block of the convention center totally open for now.

63
00:03:26,758 --> 00:03:29,669
Scott: Yeah Pax prime renamed to backs west.

64
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,110
Rym: Yep.

65
00:03:30,572 --> 00:03:31,656
Scott: I'm really somewhat related.

66
00:03:31,696 --> 00:03:34,789
Rym: news ominous Portentous.

67
00:03:36,626 --> 00:03:39,725
Rym: So, yeah Otherwise got any news.

68
00:03:39,866 --> 00:03:40,669
Rym: It's a Wednesday.

69
00:03:40,689 --> 00:03:46,339
Scott: This isn't really the biggest news, but Now available for purchase with real money.

70
00:03:46,861 --> 00:03:52,480
Scott: They released a box set of like every Miyazaki movie in on berets or whatever.

71
00:03:53,245 --> 00:03:55,200
Scott: So obviously you shouldn't be buying any berets.

72
00:03:55,822 --> 00:03:59,899
Scott: But in case there is something I know I mean like I've seen them all but I know people who haven't seen them all.

73
00:04:00,961 --> 00:04:02,306
Scott: I'm sure a lot of people haven't seen them all.

74
00:04:02,808 --> 00:04:03,832
Scott: so this is the chance.

75
00:04:03,873 --> 00:04:06,568
Scott: like this is the time now you can go and Get all these movies.

76
00:04:06,588 --> 00:04:13,384
Scott: I don't don't buy the berets But I'm sure you can get digital downloads or you somebody ripped all the berets You know, whatever.

77
00:04:13,484 --> 00:04:17,315
Scott: but now is the time to watch all the Miyazaki movies.

78
00:04:17,356 --> 00:04:22,371
Scott: in case you've missed some You know with English subtitles on them the dub.

79
00:04:22,652 --> 00:04:25,162
Scott: good movies are bad all of them You know.

80
00:04:25,242 --> 00:04:26,587
Scott: not, you know, just all of them.

81
00:04:26,728 --> 00:04:27,591
Scott: the whole set will sit.

82
00:04:27,953 --> 00:04:31,389
Rym: and while we don't talk about it constantly We're still watching Adventure Time.

83
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:38,138
Rym: like Adventure Time is still great right up There was Steven Universe and all those I feel like people stop talking about it, but it's like it hasn't gone anywhere.

84
00:04:38,158 --> 00:04:38,720
Scott: It's still.

85
00:04:39,581 --> 00:04:41,969
Rym: Yeah, well partly it just started up again recently.

86
00:04:42,029 --> 00:04:45,220
Rym: So there's a bunch of episodes and I guess it's only South Park schedule.

87
00:04:45,441 --> 00:04:48,992
Rym: Yeah, which is fine because they're always great and I'm happy to see them.

88
00:04:49,113 --> 00:04:51,320
Scott: and it seems I guess there's a new South Park.

89
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:51,908
Scott: It's tonight.

90
00:04:52,252 --> 00:04:58,075
Rym: Oh, yeah One of those skip weeks I'm fully caught up on South Park now, so it is a good time.

91
00:04:58,175 --> 00:04:59,679
Rym: interesting continuity of that.

92
00:05:02,123 --> 00:05:10,859
Rym: But Adventure Time if you didn't know is Having a miniseries called stakes about delicious delicious steaks.

93
00:05:11,241 --> 00:05:18,338
Rym: nope, like wooden steaks like what you'd use to kill a vampire and Marceline's backstory as a vampire hunter.

94
00:05:20,002 --> 00:05:22,270
Scott: So her dad being all evil we're gonna find out.

95
00:05:22,351 --> 00:05:26,241
Scott: probably haven't seen Marceline's dad in so long Abadir.

96
00:05:26,602 --> 00:05:33,966
Rym: yeah, just the other night Emily and I watched the episode where they go down and stand in line and episode so good Oh my god with the bananas.

97
00:05:34,127 --> 00:05:35,433
Scott: I know you.

98
00:05:35,895 --> 00:05:41,229
Rym: when he lets everyone out of prison He's like so yeah, you can all leave but I mean you're in the night our sphere.

99
00:05:41,329 --> 00:05:48,325
Rym: So I There's a lot of people don't.

100
00:05:48,366 --> 00:05:53,586
Rym: but that show is still like grade-a Animation and it is still coming out.

101
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:54,669
Scott: Why would they stop?

102
00:05:55,451 --> 00:05:56,895
Rym: I wonder how long it'll keep going.

103
00:05:56,935 --> 00:05:58,980
Scott: because well, what will end first?

104
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:06,480
Rym: Adventure time or Lo Simpson ace adventure time or Western democracy?

105
00:06:08,463 --> 00:06:10,434
Rym: But think about this Simpsons or the world.

106
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:21,258
Rym: Adventure time has been going You know year by year and Finn is aging in real time as the show went.

107
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:23,899
Rym: Yeah They could just keep going.

108
00:06:24,741 --> 00:06:26,316
Rym: Imagine if 20 years from now.

109
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:31,599
Rym: Finn is just an adult and the show is just continued on without an arm.

110
00:06:32,161 --> 00:06:34,450
Rym: Yeah, or maybe he's got a cyborg arm.

111
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,374
Rym: Maybe a sword arm.

112
00:06:35,956 --> 00:06:36,779
Rym: Maybe is a sword.

113
00:06:37,382 --> 00:06:38,547
Rym: There's an episode coming out.

114
00:06:38,567 --> 00:06:40,054
Rym: The title is just I am a sword.

115
00:06:40,154 --> 00:06:41,440
Rym: So, you know that shits coming back.

116
00:06:41,521 --> 00:06:42,452
Scott: That's gonna be good one.

117
00:06:42,614 --> 00:06:42,918
Rym: It is.

118
00:06:43,765 --> 00:06:51,600
Rym: But adventure time continues to be great and quote Told in eight parts stakes details Marceline the vampire Queen's desire to no longer be a vampire.

119
00:06:51,861 --> 00:06:55,240
Scott: Well, she wasn't a vampire to begin with so I'm sure she became a vampire.

120
00:06:55,340 --> 00:07:04,044
Rym: But as we know from the plot of a few seasons back it when Finn and Jake and the wish that the Lich never Existed and all that nonsense.

121
00:07:04,365 --> 00:07:10,795
Rym: Mm-hmm that if she was not a vampire she can get she'll live a long time But she's not immortal.

122
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:20,380
Rym: Nope so The fact that she's a vampire is the only reason she is still young and hot and generally awesome as opposed to an old angry Chrome, but she won't have to drink red stuff anymore.

123
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:27,225
Rym: She just ate real food like everyone else true and then she won't just see everything through the blood red vampire eyes as she's talked About in the past.

124
00:07:27,325 --> 00:07:27,466
Rym: Mm-hmm.

125
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:33,375
Rym: So but then she won't be immortal So theoretically she might die of old age and Bubs will still be around.

126
00:07:33,656 --> 00:07:33,997
Scott: Who knows?

127
00:07:34,258 --> 00:07:37,378
Rym: Yeah Maybe we'll know at the end of all this.

128
00:07:39,122 --> 00:07:40,770
Rym: I'm not gonna look up any spoilers.

129
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:41,493
Rym: You shouldn't either.

130
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:42,940
Rym: just watch it.

131
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,943
Rym: I guess it's out.

132
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:56,400
Scott: if you're not watching adventure time at all period maybe our description of this miniseries Sort of thing sub series part will make you realize that it's not just like oh my god math.

133
00:07:56,942 --> 00:07:57,786
Rym: If you're not why?

134
00:07:57,826 --> 00:08:00,879
Rym: yeah adventure time season one is oh my god math and it's great.

135
00:08:01,422 --> 00:08:06,580
Rym: Season two is math and plot and then it just keeps changing like every season is way different.

136
00:08:07,084 --> 00:08:12,470
Rym: The show evolves in a way that very few television shows ever have like.

137
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:18,829
Rym: it's very rare to see a show that is where it is now and Going back like in 20 episode chunks.

138
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,875
Rym: It's like a totally different show every time.

139
00:08:20,896 --> 00:08:22,160
Rym: South Park South Park.

140
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:30,839
Rym: Yeah, South Park has done that to a degree But at the same time South Park has also had some constants that only now are being discarded like the relics that they are.

141
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:40,186
Rym: officer bar Brady It's not killing Kenny a long time ago, yeah, well because there's a plot around that I know in fact, they made the plot of why he's that way cannon.

142
00:08:40,346 --> 00:08:51,044
Rym: Yeah in that miniseries with the key Things of the day.

143
00:08:51,365 --> 00:09:02,800
Rym: so in panels as we have said and as anyone who does panels like us has said Lotus war pretty much like one of the first big anime in the US where a lot of people are like, holy shit anime.

144
00:09:03,522 --> 00:09:09,647
Scott: It was a generic fantasy with general mass appeal, you know fighting dragons Yeah, very D&D style.

145
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:11,274
Scott: very it was serious.

146
00:09:11,334 --> 00:09:17,529
Scott: It wasn't silly like slayers Yeah, so it didn't have a lot of like, you know Anything culturally specific to Japan or anything?

147
00:09:17,549 --> 00:09:24,920
Rym: it was one of the first if not the first Anime series to be released as a box set and DVD in the United States.

148
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:30,609
Scott: Yeah, and you know There was a TV series and OVA and you know And you had also the Lotus Island thing going on.

149
00:09:30,689 --> 00:09:33,360
Rym: Lotus Island is the best aspect of Lotus War.

150
00:09:33,882 --> 00:09:45,259
Rym: The second best aspect is the first episode of the original OAV and then none of the rest of it's that great Soundtracks good, but if you didn't know it's based on a bunch of nerds playing D&D.

151
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:51,780
Scott: I mean one-to-one like these nerds played D&D and then they took their campaign and made this anime out of it.

152
00:09:51,961 --> 00:09:59,283
Scott: Literally, I mean look it's dwarf elf Fighter, I mean, come on Yeah, like you thought like.

153
00:09:59,303 --> 00:10:00,628
Rym: oh, it's just like my D&D game.

154
00:10:00,668 --> 00:10:07,000
Rym: No, it is a D&D game is literally It's exactly what your friends all said.

155
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:12,620
Rym: They do where you're gonna write the novel of your campaign because it's so original and great.

156
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:16,473
Scott: Of course, you know someone else did it and you didn't because they're better than you.

157
00:10:16,594 --> 00:10:16,835
Rym: Yep.

158
00:10:17,096 --> 00:10:27,160
Rym: What's real interesting is The stats for some of these people not great But they have sketches like there's deed lit like that's the characters straight up.

159
00:10:27,449 --> 00:10:42,667
Rym: Okay So, uh, yeah These are the actual character sheets of the D&D game that got turned into an anime That was super super huge in the US for a while and now is basically completely forgotten Everywhere except for us.

160
00:10:43,049 --> 00:10:43,451
Rym: Oh shit.

161
00:10:43,551 --> 00:10:46,241
Rym: Alex just launched Civ 5.

162
00:10:46,241 --> 00:10:48,550
Rym: Shit's going down in our long-form game, but I digress.

163
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:49,233
Scott: Whose turn is next?

164
00:10:49,936 --> 00:10:50,237
Rym: Chris.

165
00:10:50,538 --> 00:10:54,059
Rym: Okay I set up to where it goes James Lisa and the AI and then me.

166
00:10:54,501 --> 00:10:58,640
Rym: So once it hits that little like bam bam bam bam and come right back to me anyway.

167
00:11:00,423 --> 00:11:02,199
Scott: Anyway, so yeah Oh thing of the day.

168
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:15,476
Scott: So there's these dudes in Australia, right and they did perhaps the most Australian thing there is, you know wearing shorts sandals t-shirts Sitting at a picnic table drinking, you know about as Australian as it gets.

169
00:11:15,536 --> 00:11:16,620
Rym: that's pretty Australian.

170
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:23,758
Scott: But the one difference is their picnic table Was motorized with wheels and they're driving it down the road.

171
00:11:23,778 --> 00:11:24,280
Rym: that you know.

172
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:29,525
Rym: That's a step up because when I was at PAX Australia there was a bus stop at the con.

173
00:11:29,886 --> 00:11:36,949
Rym: that was a bar that you could basically sit in a little car and Pedal and drink and it drove you around.

174
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:38,314
Rym: This is a step up from that.

175
00:11:38,334 --> 00:11:38,836
Rym: Mm-hmm.

176
00:11:39,358 --> 00:11:46,857
Scott: So Yeah, the cops want to go after them, but almost everyone is like nothing more Aussie than that.

177
00:11:46,917 --> 00:11:48,260
Scott: What the fuck cops lay off.

178
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,255
Scott: Also, where can I get one?

179
00:11:50,275 --> 00:11:55,340
Scott: I See a future where all cars are replaced by motorized picnic tables.

180
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,705
Scott: Imagine self-driving.

181
00:11:56,966 --> 00:12:01,347
Rym: just New York's just had self-driving automated tables like that Just kind of put her hard.

182
00:12:01,367 --> 00:12:01,628
Scott: to play.

183
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:03,240
Scott: a board game though might get blown off the table.

184
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,692
Rym: You got to play magnetic board games only even then.

185
00:12:05,732 --> 00:12:09,066
Scott: if it goes a little, you know, if you're going fast I mean you didn't getting quite a wind there.

186
00:12:09,086 --> 00:12:13,039
Rym: Yeah, you know Ukraine is weak situation possibly to New York, right?

187
00:12:14,064 --> 00:12:17,360
Scott: But yeah motorized picnic table, that's awesomest.

188
00:12:18,143 --> 00:12:20,230
Scott: I want to see races in the meta moment.

189
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,439
Rym: The booklet book was a wheel of time a long time ago.

190
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,680
Scott: now It's the square of space.

191
00:12:25,365 --> 00:12:26,614
Rym: No, it's still the wheel of time.

192
00:12:26,836 --> 00:12:29,947
Rym: So We just keep reading those books.

193
00:12:30,108 --> 00:12:32,257
Rym: I blew past you you do I stopped.

194
00:12:32,297 --> 00:12:32,939
Scott: I'm reading comics.

195
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:33,783
Scott: now I haven't read.

196
00:12:33,843 --> 00:12:35,369
Rym: finish the fourth book, right?

197
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:35,791
Scott: Yes.

198
00:12:36,153 --> 00:12:37,920
Rym: I'm all the fifth books actually real short.

199
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:41,680
Scott: I read only the most beginning of the fifth one and then I stopped in him reading comics.

200
00:12:41,941 --> 00:12:43,064
Rym: Yeah, I got into some shit.

201
00:12:43,084 --> 00:12:43,805
Rym: a bunch of ale.

202
00:12:43,826 --> 00:12:47,419
Rym: Let's say came back over the wall a Bunch of what came over the whale?

203
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,002
Rym: Those people ale.

204
00:12:50,122 --> 00:12:51,585
Rym: I think it's just ale a lemon.

205
00:12:51,605 --> 00:13:06,492
Rym: Yeah, Nina winna Vinay is real annoying now Like more than before she is so bad that pretty much every character like every character who knows her has had long Conversations on how much they are sick of her shit.

206
00:13:06,894 --> 00:13:09,540
Rym: It's kind of great actually But I digress.

207
00:13:10,144 --> 00:13:12,760
Rym: Otherwise, we're gonna be at magfest doing panels.

208
00:13:13,061 --> 00:13:19,880
Rym: We're gonna be probably at pecs out doing panels and probably be a paxies doing panels probably an anime boss and doing panels.

209
00:13:20,162 --> 00:13:21,939
Rym: Stay tuned for panels.

210
00:13:24,242 --> 00:13:27,857
Rym: And otherwise, we have our t-shirts on sale again, so you can just buy those.

211
00:13:27,877 --> 00:13:28,139
Rym: I got one.

212
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,262
Scott: Does anyone bought one?

213
00:13:29,563 --> 00:13:35,519
Rym: Uh, yeah, like six or seven people now, okay, but I got why they're way higher quality than the first print.

214
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:37,980
Rym: run like way better.

215
00:13:38,462 --> 00:13:42,359
Scott: So you should buy one without our faces on it and then it'll be really good t-shirt.

216
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:45,349
Rym: No, cuz there's standard t-shirt, but it's a good face.

217
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:46,715
Rym: It's a good face shot of us.

218
00:13:47,037 --> 00:13:47,820
Rym: It's a quality shirt.

219
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,243
Rym: I like it.

220
00:13:48,464 --> 00:13:49,915
Rym: Okay, I'm gonna wear it to work.

221
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:50,640
Rym: Okay?

222
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:58,053
Rym: Yeah, there's something about wearing a shirt that has your own face on it Not ironically and just waiting to see if anyone notices.

223
00:13:58,495 --> 00:13:59,500
Scott: That's something you would do.

224
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,408
Rym: Yeah, that is definitely something I would tell.

225
00:14:01,488 --> 00:14:04,260
Rym: your ego is that big and our patreon is going strong.

226
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:08,000
Rym: We're getting close to some of those stretch goals that require us to do things.

227
00:14:08,543 --> 00:14:16,240
Rym: So if we get a little more money in the patreon We're gonna release with commentary all of the beta episodes of GeekNights to the patrons.

228
00:14:17,321 --> 00:14:18,686
Scott: Yeah, don't spend your money in that garbage.

229
00:14:18,706 --> 00:14:21,076
Rym: Yeah, we sang our own theme song guys.

230
00:14:21,096 --> 00:14:21,698
Rym: So you don't want this.

231
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:30,599
Scott: You're gonna hear it's like if you go to the grocery store and they're like mystery dessert and you're like, ooh I'll pay five dollars to mystery dessert and it's poop in a bag.

232
00:14:30,881 --> 00:14:39,095
Rym: That's like at the anime con and the dealers got the mystery grab bag $20 and you open it up and it's just like some air gear trading car.

233
00:14:39,135 --> 00:14:46,140
Scott: That's like loot crate The stuff the comic book store couldn't sell and it filled up the warehouse.

234
00:14:46,381 --> 00:14:50,160
Scott: So they gave it to loot crate and then loot crate send it to you and you paid for it.

235
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:57,183
Rym: It's a company that just redirected a conveyor belt that was going to the dump and it redirected it into basically Entirely true.

236
00:14:57,223 --> 00:15:10,699
Scott: so loot crate does it seems at least from I can't I don't know this for sure but it seems for the most part what they do is they take in the nerdy inventory that doesn't sell well the stuff that Would go to the discount rag otherwise and then manages to sell it by, you know.

237
00:15:11,001 --> 00:15:14,599
Scott: So, you know with their method of get a mystery bunch of nerd stuff every month.

238
00:15:15,182 --> 00:15:18,532
Scott: But it seems like they also do promotional things.

239
00:15:18,572 --> 00:15:23,063
Scott: Like let's say you really wanted to promote Batman's right?

240
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:28,199
Rym: so you know in the old you would you would buy it Batman in the like swag bag, right?

241
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:36,414
Scott: So DC would pay loot crate to say hey put a bunch of this Batman shit We just made that's good in the loot crate to promote Batman this month.

242
00:15:36,434 --> 00:15:37,979
Scott: So I think they also make money that way.

243
00:15:38,742 --> 00:15:46,175
Rym: But anyway, there's another stretch goal if we get past that one where we'll actually live stream GeekNights every night Like every time we do a show, we'll just live stream us doing.

244
00:15:46,215 --> 00:15:46,859
Scott: who wants that?

245
00:15:47,261 --> 00:15:50,100
Scott: I don't know, but you have to put things people want that are actually good.

246
00:15:50,341 --> 00:15:55,969
Scott: But what you should put give us a thousand dollars a month We'll stop making this goddamn show that there is.

247
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:59,999
Rym: there is the stretch goal of we will literally quit our jobs and dance for you full-time forever.

248
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:02,932
Rym: So I get us to that one.

249
00:16:03,013 --> 00:16:04,039
Rym: I would really like that.

250
00:16:05,281 --> 00:16:11,724
Rym: But yeah, listen to the part of the episode after the credits because I do a patreon thing Every night now.

251
00:16:11,744 --> 00:16:13,910
Scott: All right, you want to definitely want to stop before the credits.

252
00:16:14,392 --> 00:16:16,097
Rym: Yeah, the thing is it's real hard.

253
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:27,692
Rym: I don't know if you've ever Scott looked at a list of like 50 or 60 names and tried to say all of the names Very quickly in a row just by reading them and pronouncing them all correctly.

254
00:16:27,732 --> 00:16:28,555
Scott: Why are you doing this?

255
00:16:28,956 --> 00:16:30,200
Rym: Cuz I said I'd do it.

256
00:16:30,461 --> 00:16:31,024
Scott: Why don't you?

257
00:16:31,044 --> 00:16:32,391
Scott: I mean some patrons.

258
00:16:32,411 --> 00:16:34,160
Scott: you should say the name once not every single show.

259
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:34,984
Rym: No Cuz they that's all.

260
00:16:35,004 --> 00:16:40,738
Rym: they got a key paying for me to keep saying their name And I say the names in the order of the amount of money they give us.

261
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:46,840
Rym: Someone is always giving $1 more than whoever gave the most to be at the top.

262
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:47,664
Scott: Is that true?

263
00:16:47,784 --> 00:16:48,086
Scott: Yes.

264
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:49,334
Scott: Why are people doing this?

265
00:16:49,374 --> 00:16:50,199
Scott: What the hell's wrong with you?

266
00:16:52,122 --> 00:16:52,587
Rym: It's great.

267
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:53,334
Rym: It's real great.

268
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:56,806
Rym: Okay We're an institution.

269
00:16:56,826 --> 00:16:57,388
Rym: what can I say?

270
00:16:57,408 --> 00:16:59,176
Rym: we provide a lot of joy to people's lives.

271
00:16:59,216 --> 00:17:00,040
Rym: I think he's right.

272
00:17:00,901 --> 00:17:04,996
Rym: I mean the listener really is into this and I guess I joke from is gone.

273
00:17:05,175 --> 00:17:07,305
Scott: if you want to give us money Here's a better idea.

274
00:17:07,566 --> 00:17:10,037
Scott: get an Amazon gift card and don't send it on this patreon.

275
00:17:10,057 --> 00:17:10,619
Scott: Just send it to me.

276
00:17:10,723 --> 00:17:11,050
Rym: No, no No.

277
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:15,455
Rym: If you're gonna send us money Use the YouTube fan funding and just click and say give us money.

278
00:17:15,696 --> 00:17:16,280
Scott: you could do that, too.

279
00:17:16,441 --> 00:17:17,167
Rym: Cuz that'll go to me.

280
00:17:17,248 --> 00:17:21,446
Rym: cuz most of the stuff's on my channel Do it through.

281
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:22,532
Scott: anyone that's taken a cut.

282
00:17:22,594 --> 00:17:29,000
Rym: just send me an Amazon Bunch of people said they don't want to do the patreon because they only want more gig knives presents antenna.

283
00:17:30,022 --> 00:17:33,417
Rym: So to those people I said, okay don't patron us.

284
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:33,940
Rym: It's fine.

285
00:17:34,562 --> 00:17:39,300
Rym: When we do episodes just put money into the YouTube thing once the episode is live.

286
00:17:39,782 --> 00:17:41,628
Rym: So I'm doing pre-production.

Rym: Yeah, I read a bunch of comics.

293
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:54,840
Rym: The problem is in the pile of comics Scott gave me there was also all the one punch man.

Rym: That'll be the next show.

298
00:18:02,086 --> 00:18:13,965
Scott: So Jeff Lemire, perhaps one of the favorite comic creators of GeekNights also known for making things like Trillium Sweet Tooth You know Essex County trilogy.

Scott: Yeah, right and he's been doing a lot of stuff for like, you know DC and whatnot.

300
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,733
Scott: You did some superhero stuff, but we should just get him on the show.

301
00:18:21,773 --> 00:18:23,240
Rym: He's like one of our favorite comics people.

302

Scott: Yeah, he's just Canadian duty likes hockey.

303
00:18:25,126 --> 00:18:25,427
Scott: Whatever.

00:18:25,849 --> 00:18:35,080
Scott: So he's doing this new series and I saw the cover of it and On the cover yellow robot boy in space and it's like well, that's all I need to know.

305
00:18:35,484 --> 00:18:44,995
Rym: Not just robot boy in space It's robot boy in space silhouetted by the moon looking up pensively and it's called descenders Like what the hell is this thing?

306
00:18:45,056 --> 00:18:52,952
Scott: So All you need to know is Jeff Lemire made it and that's what's on the cover and that's a cell Immediately some kind of sci-fi thing with a robot boy.

307
00:18:52,972 --> 00:18:53,032
Scott: Yep.

308
00:18:53,454 --> 00:18:54,137
Rym: It's like.

309
00:18:54,157 --> 00:18:54,920
Scott: is this Astro Boy?

310
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:55,481
Scott: It's like what?

311
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:55,902
Scott: I don't know.

312
00:18:56,103 --> 00:18:57,146
Rym: So I'm getting an Astro.

313
00:18:57,167 --> 00:18:59,675
Rym: There's definitely an Astro Boy vibe.

314
00:18:59,695 --> 00:19:01,280
Scott: It doesn't punched anyone at all.

315
00:19:01,783 --> 00:19:04,220
Rym: Yeah, no punching Astro Boy didn't punch people right away.

316
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,495
Rym: He was just a sad sort of orphan almost thing.

317
00:19:07,676 --> 00:19:14,228
Scott: Anyway, anyway So, uh, I bought issue one and I was like I read that and I'm like, well, that's exactly what I thought it was gonna be winner.

318
00:19:14,248 --> 00:19:23,571
Scott: Yeah, and Very recently trade paperback number one came out and if you get that You can even get it digitally if you really want to be.

319
00:19:23,651 --> 00:19:26,540
Scott: there's only like one issue out beyond what's in the trade.

320
00:19:26,681 --> 00:19:28,519
Scott: So the trade is pretty much it.

321
00:19:28,761 --> 00:19:31,853
Rym: Yeah, so you'll know as much as we know just about.

322
00:19:31,873 --> 00:19:33,600
Scott: I think there's one more issue you can read anyway.

323
00:19:34,343 --> 00:19:36,771
Rym: So there's a big info drop at the like.

324
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:38,839
Rym: a mic gets dropped at the end of the first trade.

325
00:19:38,859 --> 00:19:41,388
Scott: Sure So what is descender actually about?

326
00:19:41,569 --> 00:19:43,235
Scott: Well, it's quick summary.

327
00:19:43,295 --> 00:19:44,660
Scott: It's not really spoilers or anything.

328
00:19:45,324 --> 00:19:51,200
Scott: there is a sort of solar system and There are aliens living on all the planets in the solar system.

329
00:19:51,663 --> 00:20:02,829
Scott: Yep, different kinds of aliens in each planet like this one There's like even a weird water planet like they're way different and there's sort of one central planet and that central planet is like the galette The you know the council or whatever, right?

330
00:20:02,849 --> 00:20:05,960
Scott: It's like the capital place and all the different aliens come and visit.

331
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:19,270
Scott: Yeah, every sci-fi setting right and there's some super high-tech shit, especially Super high-tech robots, you know because super high-tech sci-fi future Meanwhile on some faraway rock.

332
00:20:19,311 --> 00:20:21,359
Scott: That's a lot like the rock from say aliens.

333
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:25,879
Scott: Yeah Very similar to the rock from aliens.

334
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:34,800
Scott: there is a family mining or something and They got a boy robot who's like a member of the family, you know, that's very Astro boy right there.

335
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,001
Rym: Like.

336
00:20:35,021 --> 00:20:46,034
Scott: it's also like say a bicentennial man where a robot is a member of the family Yeah, or like aliens where a family is mining on a rock far away Yeah in space and then maybe a disaster befalls, right?

337
00:20:46,396 --> 00:20:51,320
Scott: So this robot boy You know outlives all the people on the mining rock.

338
00:20:51,661 --> 00:20:54,896
Rym: Yeah, he basically wakes up like something activates the system and they're totally dead.

339
00:20:54,996 --> 00:20:55,760
Rym: Everyone's been dead.

340
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:09,006
Scott: Meanwhile back on you know the center of the you know civilization some strange gigantic robot heads Unicrons or some shit actually reading.

341
00:21:09,046 --> 00:21:16,898
Rym: it was pretty great because basically the whole beginning of the comic other than the boy on the moon Is all these shots of people being like.

342
00:21:18,626 --> 00:21:22,300
Rym: And then someone else looks out of frame and says what the fuck is that?

343
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,420
Rym: But it doesn't show you what the fuck is that until for a while you keep flipping it.

344
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,687
Rym: Finally, you see what the fuck is that?

345
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:35,334
Rym: It is just a giant Fucking robot standing there looking at everyone like bad news.

346
00:21:35,414 --> 00:21:39,552
Scott: bad in space bigger than your planet Like Independence Day has got nothing on this thing.

347
00:21:39,592 --> 00:21:44,351
Rym: This is like Unicron level Yeah, and it's like humanoid just like Jay.

348
00:21:44,411 --> 00:21:48,827
Scott: it's just standing there and you know, so you're thinking ooh It's that that's that same old thing.

349
00:21:48,867 --> 00:21:51,175
Scott: We see in every kind of alien story, right?

350
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:52,380
Scott: You encounter the alien.

351
00:21:52,661 --> 00:21:53,504
Scott: Are they gonna be good?

352
00:21:53,805 --> 00:21:55,330
Scott: Are they gonna be bad and never good?

353
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:56,895
Scott: No, just like Independence Day.

354
00:21:57,256 --> 00:21:58,360
Scott: They're immediately just bad.

355
00:21:58,641 --> 00:21:59,083
Rym: Yeah, it's great.

356
00:21:59,103 --> 00:22:02,797
Rym: They go up and they're like, I think it's gonna communicate and then kill all humans.

357
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:08,100
Rym: Yeah, they all just fuck everything up for a while and then leave mysterious.

358
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,231
Scott: They didn't kill everyone but they just fucked everything.

359
00:22:10,272 --> 00:22:15,639
Scott: the fuck up like your bad Right, the greatest and the artwork is so amazing.

360
00:22:16,561 --> 00:22:23,020
Scott: But the best one is that one whole page of like the girls mom getting eye-lasered by the giant robot.

361
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,913
Scott: Oh, it's like I want to put that shit on my wall.

362
00:22:24,953 --> 00:22:26,522
Scott: Yeah, I don't need the original It's too much money.

363
00:22:26,563 --> 00:22:28,570
Scott: Give me a print that's like twice the size or something.

364
00:22:29,133 --> 00:22:30,920
Scott: Yeah, so I can put that up.

365
00:22:31,261 --> 00:22:36,904
Rym: Oh, yeah, so think about that normal sci-fi universe these giant Humanoid robots appear.

366
00:22:37,185 --> 00:22:38,127
Rym: they're super advanced.

367
00:22:38,187 --> 00:22:41,767
Rym: No one understands them and Everyone's kind of waiting for what they're gonna do.

368
00:22:42,089 --> 00:22:44,820
Rym: They fuck up a bunch of shit and then they disappear.

369
00:22:45,102 --> 00:22:47,880
Scott: It's like why didn't if they were evil, why didn't they just kill everybody?

370
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:53,358
Scott: It's like there's so many questions and secrets of space you want to know and then of course the ultimate secret of space.

371
00:22:53,538 --> 00:23:01,040
Scott: obviously Robot boy is connected to the giant evil robot somehow and that's the terrible secret of space that you're trying to find out.

372
00:23:01,742 --> 00:23:06,956
Rym: Now it's Jeff Lemire's the author and looks like Dustin Nguyen is the artist for this.

373
00:23:07,076 --> 00:23:10,605
Scott: Yep, and There is already.

374
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:16,399
Rym: I was looking up like the Wikipedia just to talk about like dates or whatever, but there's already a movie.

375
00:23:17,123 --> 00:23:19,300
Scott: Well option, you know, yeah, it's actually gonna get made.

376
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:25,752
Rym: Well, I think so Sony picked up the rights for the series to make a movie So the odds are better than if anyone else had picked it up.

377
00:23:25,813 --> 00:23:27,220
Scott: I mean it did make that surrogates movie.

378
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,327
Rym: Yeah, and this has.

379
00:23:29,347 --> 00:23:32,156
Rym: this is a screenplay for a movie written all over it.

380
00:23:32,176 --> 00:23:33,280
Scott: Jeff Lemire gonna get the payday.

381
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:34,579
Rym: Yeah, he deserves it.

382
00:23:35,162 --> 00:23:40,340
Rym: Now ideally imagine if this were done as like an animation in the kind of the style of the comic.

383
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,324
Rym: But you know, that's not gonna happen.

384
00:23:41,424 --> 00:23:42,708
Rym: Oh my god, that would be.

385
00:23:42,728 --> 00:23:45,057
Scott: you're gonna really make all those watercolors to end.

386
00:23:45,217 --> 00:23:46,964
Scott: Yeah That'd be so much work.

387
00:23:47,065 --> 00:23:51,704
Rym: Can't express how deeply I'd be into that sure, but I'm so much works But no Sony's actually.

388
00:23:51,744 --> 00:23:54,092
Rym: so what Lemire and Nguyen said was quote.

389
00:23:54,373 --> 00:23:56,560
Rym: It was a competitive situation for descender.

390
00:23:57,021 --> 00:24:04,040
Rym: So multiple people were probably bidding already to make the movie chair and Sony had the highest bid.

391
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:04,888
Rym: Boom.

392
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:08,572
Rym: Yeah You're so good cash money.

393
00:24:08,773 --> 00:24:09,860
Scott: Don't wait all the bills.

394
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,709
Rym: You should just read it like.

395
00:24:10,729 --> 00:24:15,272
Rym: if you're a comics fan Like this is one of those things of just read it because it's like you're.

396
00:24:15,493 --> 00:24:17,420
Scott: you know, you're probably out there some sci-fi.

397
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,206
Scott: You know your nerd you like sci-fi stuff.

398
00:24:19,226 --> 00:24:23,259
Scott: You're looking for this, you know stories like this and there aren't really a lot of them.

399
00:24:23,703 --> 00:24:25,360
Scott: Yeah, it's like what else are you gonna go get?

400
00:24:25,461 --> 00:24:26,027
Rym: In fact, you know what?

401
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:27,160
Rym: I'll say and I'm not again.

402
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,459
Rym: I don't want to spoil stuff because so much happens in the first trade.

403
00:24:31,305 --> 00:24:32,855
Rym: It's like saga like you think.

404
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:36,134
Rym: start thinking like alright I see where this is going and this is definitely on the sock.

405
00:24:36,155 --> 00:24:37,120
Scott: like this and saga.

406
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,586
Scott: I like the top two comics right now.

407
00:24:38,647 --> 00:24:40,354
Rym: Yeah, cuz every page you're like, oh, whoa.

408
00:24:40,414 --> 00:24:45,397
Rym: Whoa that escalated quickly Oh shit, and then it ends on a cliffhanger of what?

409
00:24:47,149 --> 00:24:49,325
Rym: so Remember Prometheus?

410
00:24:49,887 --> 00:24:58,000
Rym: Yeah, remember how Prometheus was the story of hey Here's a terrible secret room space and we're gonna fuck everything up and it sucks the end.

411
00:24:59,061 --> 00:24:59,343
Rym: there are.

412
00:24:59,403 --> 00:25:05,523
Rym: see already there are scenes in this where the same from a theist kind of thing happens and The care it's.

413
00:25:05,643 --> 00:25:12,147
Rym: it's sort of like what happens in that scene is should have been what Prometheus did Like.

414
00:25:12,712 --> 00:25:13,600
Rym: I don't want to say anymore.

415
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,062
Scott: I mean like.

416
00:25:14,082 --> 00:25:15,406
Scott: look we've referenced so many.

417
00:25:15,426 --> 00:25:18,939
Scott: I mean you got the Astro boy and the aliens too and the.

418
00:25:18,979 --> 00:25:22,740
Scott: for me It's like you get so many things coming in on this the Independence Day.

419
00:25:23,222 --> 00:25:27,340
Scott: It is like the best of all sci-fi things together, but it's not any one of them.

420
00:25:27,662 --> 00:25:29,380
Scott: You know, it's not like a redo of any one thing.

421
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:33,640
Scott: It's like, you know the aspects of all the best aspects of all the best things combined.

422
00:25:34,121 --> 00:25:41,520
Rym: I mean, we're already on pig planet with gladiatorial arenas robot genocides going on space pirates.

423
00:25:47,025 --> 00:25:49,118
Rym: Of course one of those people is not a human.

424
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,897
Scott: Hahaha Glad you brought up those nasty who's.

425
00:25:54,018 --> 00:25:56,475
Rym: who's kill kill who's.

426
00:25:57,141 --> 00:26:00,592
Scott: Yeah, so there's a lot of characters in this probably and it's like.

427
00:26:00,612 --> 00:26:02,800
Scott: the main character is like, you know, the robot boy.

428
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,603
Scott: It's like he's okay.

429
00:26:03,824 --> 00:26:07,517
Rym: He's earnest and he's you know, what personality wise he's Astro boy.

430

434
00:26:20,259 --> 00:26:24,311

00:26:24,331 --> 00:26:24,873
Rym: driller is great.

436
00:26:24,933 --> 00:26:28,923
Rym: driller Driller is a.

437
00:26:28,944 --> 00:26:30,489

Rym: I want a t-shirt.

439
00:26:31,232 --> 00:26:31,513

Scott: driller is a killer driller It's a real killer.

441
00:26:35,064 --> 00:26:44,050
Rym: Well, there's there's a moment where drillers like driller not kill for now and everyone's like, okay good Read this and then there's another part.

442
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,556
Scott: it's like driller killer now.

00:27:17,486 --> 00:27:21,780
Rym: the other big guy reminds me a little bit of Bato from what little we've seen of him.

452
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,173
Scott: Yeah, he doesn't talk.

453
00:27:23,274 --> 00:27:32,400
Rym: big Hume Yeah has some cyborg and he's hanging out with the girl who's a badass a little bit of a major vibe Like that kind of character bringing the ghost in the shells into it.

454
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:35,379
Scott: How many more sci-fi properties you want to bring into the descender?

455
00:27:35,661 --> 00:27:39,120
Rym: Considered with it with the codexes and the technology culture series is here.

456
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:46,371
Scott: Like this is a culture series kind of I could bring in the Marvel Comics giant things There's a lot like celestials that thing that came to the planet little Galactus action, maybe.

457
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:47,454
Rym: Yep Galactus.

458
00:27:47,695 --> 00:27:49,220
Rym: It's Galactus attack the culture.

459
00:27:49,481 --> 00:27:52,314
Rym: Sure, that's what's going on here except or maybe like it's not.

460
00:27:52,334 --> 00:27:55,776
Scott: it's not at the culture level It's something it's the civilization that we're dealing with.

461
00:27:55,816 --> 00:27:56,300
Scott: here is some weight.

462
00:27:56,561 --> 00:27:59,016
Rym: So it's not the culture but it might be the culture.

463
00:27:59,036 --> 00:28:03,580
Scott: would culture Sure the culture would come and subsume or erase this shitty not culture.

464
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,310
Rym: This could be early collect before the culture form.

465
00:28:06,331 --> 00:28:08,338
Rym: You don't know the backstory of the culture could be in that universe.

466
00:28:08,358 --> 00:28:08,800
Rym: Yeah, whatever.

467
00:28:09,222 --> 00:28:12,959
Rym: Yeah, the only thing it doesn't have is Star Wars like straight up there.

468
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,280
Scott: Yeah, there are there are doesn't seem to be like spaceship space battles.

469
00:28:16,622 --> 00:28:19,660
Scott: It seems like they get in spaceships go to sleep and wake up on a planet somewhere.

470
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:23,260
Scott: They don't really go pew pew with the x-wings or star destroyers, right?

471
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:27,960
Rym: Yeah, they've hit a lot of planets in a hurry in these six issues that we've read.

472
00:28:29,023 --> 00:28:34,609
Rym: But yeah, you should read this just for driller And you know, we haven't done a lot of comic shows in a while.

473
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:37,640
Rym: You should also read fucking everything Jeff Lemire's touch.

474
00:28:37,901 --> 00:28:38,566
Rym: Yeah, pretty much.

475
00:28:38,586 --> 00:28:40,420
Scott: We've reviewed most of you don't need to read.

476
00:28:40,521 --> 00:28:43,181
Scott: I mean like, you know, I mean everything he's done is good But it's like.

477
00:28:43,483 --> 00:28:47,216

478
00:28:47,276 --> 00:28:47,978
Rym: It's now.

479
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:48,440
Rym: it's good.

480
00:28:49,043 --> 00:28:52,360
Scott: I mean we talked about that in the new 52 episode a long time ago.

481
00:28:52,941 --> 00:28:55,629
Rym: But you don't have to like Essex County like you want.

482
00:28:55,649 --> 00:28:56,712
Scott: that's a must read.

514
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:45,680

Rym: So if you send me things I can respond here Ovaltine style Scott.

526
00:32:30,902 --> 00:32:32,971
Rym: I don't think he'll ever figure it out unless one of you tells him.

527
00:32:33,252 --> 00:32:38,028
Rym: and even if one of you tells him to listen to this He'll probably not believe you and think that I'm told him.

528
00:32:38,048 --> 00:32:40,997
Rym: I told you to try and trick him into listening to it.

529
00:32:41,939 --> 00:32:44,309
Rym: And Yeah, I'll know if he listens to this or not.
