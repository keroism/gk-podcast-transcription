1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,588
Rym: It's Tuesday, September 15th, 2015.

2
00:00:10,588 --> 00:00:10,929
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,304 --> 00:00:14,716
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,364
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight.

5
00:00:16,444 --> 00:00:22,060
Rym: On Tuesday the 15th, we are talking about Rocket League, the hottest new esport.

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,217
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:26,761 --> 00:00:30,500
Rym: Recorded in advance because I'm still in Australia or Singapore or whatever for a while.

8
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,920
Scott: Yup, which means I'm chilling out playing Rocket League.

9
00:00:35,481 --> 00:00:43,160
Rym: Rocket League runs just fine on my laptop, so I bought a wired Xbox controller, which I wish I'd done before, so I'm bringing that on the planes.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,520
Scott: To play solo?

11
00:00:44,981 --> 00:00:47,920
Rym: I'm going to practice aerials and stuff solo on Rocket League.

12
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,040
Scott: Why don't you play in the AU region when you get over there?

13
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,240
Rym: Yeah, when I get over there, but I'm talking about on the flight.

14
00:00:54,182 --> 00:00:55,330
Scott: See if they have different style.

15
00:00:55,672 --> 00:00:56,679
Rym: Not that you would know.

16
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,958
Rym: Everything's backwards, they fly upside down.

17
00:00:59,180 --> 00:00:59,224
Scott: No!

18
00:01:00,846 --> 00:01:01,760
Rym: The joke that's in every Tumblr.

19
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:02,525
Scott: So does everyone.

20
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:03,794
Scott: Everyone flies upside down.

21
00:01:03,915 --> 00:01:04,599
Scott: It's Rocket League.

22
00:01:05,581 --> 00:01:10,416
Rym: If I fly upside down and I do something cool, that is literally 100% of the time not on purpose.

23
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,388
Rym: So yeah, we're back from PAX.

24
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:18,180
Rym: We played a bunch of games and we're going to talk about those in the next Tuesday show.

25
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,020
Rym: But something real big happened.

26
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:21,962
Scott: The biggest.

27
00:01:22,022 --> 00:01:23,008
Scott: Well, not the biggest.

28
00:01:23,068 --> 00:01:25,340
Scott: The biggest would be the thing we've always asked for.

29
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,220
Rym: The actual MMO.

30
00:01:26,361 --> 00:01:28,692
Scott: The Pokemon MMO, but that is not happening.

31
00:01:28,732 --> 00:01:29,938
Scott: What instead is happening is...

32
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,658
Rym: The Pokemon candy box.

33
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,359
Scott: Yes, the Ingress company, Niantic.

34
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,300
Rym: Which is now separate from Google due to all that stuff we talked about on a Monday.

35
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:43,100
Scott: Separate from Google, but apparently still very successful because Ingress was a successful game.

36
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:49,860
Scott: But they have teamed with the Nintendo to make Pokemon Go, which is the Pokemon Ingress.

37
00:01:50,341 --> 00:01:57,000
Scott: You can now, once this game comes out early next year, safely delete all your other candy boxes, your Adventure Capitalists.

38
00:01:57,767 --> 00:01:58,500
Scott: Delete all that garbage.

39
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,260
Rym: Never open your 3DS Streetpass again.

40
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,920
Scott: 3DS Streetpass in the trash.

41
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,378
Scott: Delete all the garbage games you've got and play this one garbage game above all others.

42
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,340
Rym: To rule them all and in the darkness bind them.

43
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,895
Scott: All the time you spend playing garbage games, play this one instead.

44
00:02:14,915 --> 00:02:15,920
Scott: It will rule all.

45
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:19,440
Scott: I guess you're going to have to buy this weird Bluetooth thing that looks like a Pokeball.

46
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,189
Scott: Okay, fine.

47
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:20,599
Scott: I'll buy it.

48
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,766
Rym: That's already bought.

49
00:02:21,786 --> 00:02:22,752
Rym: That's pre-ordered.

50
00:02:22,773 --> 00:02:23,819
Rym: the day I can pre-order it.

51
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,430
Scott: Alright, we got that.

52
00:02:24,491 --> 00:02:24,899
Scott: We good.

53
00:02:26,449 --> 00:02:26,717
Scott: The end.

54
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,860
Rym: It's interesting though.

55
00:02:28,201 --> 00:02:31,280
Rym: One, a clever person could have seen this coming.

56
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,820
Rym: Because there were a little... You could see business relationships and different people.

57
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,320
Scott: Yeah, they did a Pokemon Google Maps thing on some day last year.

58
00:02:39,641 --> 00:02:40,512
Rym: Or this year.

59
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:41,200
Scott: I forget when it was.

60
00:02:41,501 --> 00:02:43,020
Rym: It was about a year ago-ish.

61
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,095
Rym: I just remember it was warm out.

62
00:02:44,601 --> 00:02:48,740
Rym: And it was at least a year ago because I remember I was walking to get lunch with someone for work.

63
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:49,638
Rym: Like a business thing.

64
00:02:50,321 --> 00:02:55,820
Rym: And I zoom in on an area of Google Maps and I'd see a Pokemon on my Google Maps.

65
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,026
Rym: And I'm like, "What?

66
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:57,974
Rym: The

67
00:02:58,216 --> 00:02:58,498
Rym: fuck?".

68
00:02:59,703 --> 00:03:01,176
Rym: And I clicked on it and it said,

69
00:03:01,297 --> 00:03:01,620
Rym: "Caught!".

70
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:02,940
Rym: And it turned into a Pokeball.

71
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,026
Rym: And I was like, "Uh...".

72
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:10,220
Rym: And I started scrolling around and I saw another Pokemon like downtown.

73
00:03:11,462 --> 00:03:11,836
Rym: And yeah.

74
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,260
Scott: And then you went downtown.

75
00:03:14,007 --> 00:03:14,359
Rym: Yup.

76
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,640
Rym: But then nothing came of it and it eventually disappeared.

77
00:03:18,201 --> 00:03:20,478
Rym: But obviously that was probably...

78
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:26,699
Scott: A temporary promotion but also clearly a test to see if there would be... You know, it was a precursor to Pokemon Go.

79
00:03:27,221 --> 00:03:36,220
Rym: You know, it's also kind of smart that if you're... Pokemon is literally the perfect storm of a franchise to do any of this AR stuff with.

80
00:03:36,702 --> 00:03:38,680
Scott: Pokemon is the franchise that can do anything.

81
00:03:39,164 --> 00:03:39,413
Rym: Anything.

82
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,700
Rym: First person shooter.

83
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:41,587
Rym: We had that.

84
00:03:41,607 --> 00:03:42,619
Rym: It was called Pokemon Snap.

85
00:03:43,644 --> 00:03:45,040
Scott: You can make Pokemon Rocket League.

86
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,219
Scott: Pikachu driving a car.

87
00:03:49,362 --> 00:04:02,138
Rym: But... So with Ingress... If you're going to make an AR game though like that, what better way to prototype it than to make a game that has basically no skin or a completely flimsy skin, like say Ingress, to figure out...

88
00:04:02,561 --> 00:04:02,840
Scott: It has a skin.

89
00:04:03,141 --> 00:04:03,740
Scott: Green and blue.

90
00:04:04,521 --> 00:04:04,916
Scott: Go green.

91
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,420
Scott: Of course now it's going to be Go Dragonite.

92
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,659
Rym: Dragonite Spiritoom.

93
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:10,054
Rym: Spiritoom.

94
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,460
Scott: Man, am I going to find a fucking Spiritoom?

95
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,400
Scott: Am I going to have to go to some cavern somewhere to get a Spiritoom?

96
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,160
Rym: I better stay at the company I work for.

97
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:21,160
Scott: Or am I going to have to fly to Japan and find some ancient Spirit Stone to get a Spiritoom?

98
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,240
Rym: I've got to stay where I'm working just long enough because I travel the world a lot.

99
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,660
Rym: And let me tell you, if going to physical places matters, I'm going to be the fucking Pokemon master.

100
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,160
Scott: Well, you don't think there's anyone else who travels?

101
00:04:31,401 --> 00:04:32,879
Rym: No, I'll travel more.

102
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,919
Rym: Like, oh, I'm in Australia?

103
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,800
Rym: Well, day trip to pick up that Pokemon in Tasmania.

104
00:04:38,101 --> 00:04:42,960
Scott: I mean, in the preview video, they show a big capturing event in Times Square.

105
00:04:43,201 --> 00:04:45,720
Scott: Oh, who happens to work right fucking there?

106
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,919
Scott: I guess I'm catching that Mewtwo.

107
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,618
Scott: Good luck, everyone who doesn't live here.

108
00:04:50,842 --> 00:04:54,980
Rym: So, but yeah, with AR, no one's made good games really.

109
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,351
Rym: Like, Ingress was the best one.

110
00:04:57,512 --> 00:04:59,180
Rym: that was a game that kept going.

111
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,000
Rym: People have made AR events.

112
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,475
Scott: It's still a candy box, but it was team... It is team candy box.

113
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,750
Rym: It also had game mechanics.

114
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,856
Rym: Like, it had stuff.

115
00:05:07,896 --> 00:05:08,600
Rym: It was persistent.

116
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,656
Rym: All the AR things anyone talks about are like, I love bees.

117
00:05:11,697 --> 00:05:12,240
Rym: They're events.

118
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,240
Rym: They start and they end, and they have a lot of Mechanical Turks making them happen.

119
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,700
Rym: Ingress actually kind of just worked, which was a big deal.

120
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:24,879
Rym: But obviously they probably learned a lot from Ingress, and they probably...

121
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:29,540
Scott: You can think of this, like, not just as Pokemon, but also as Ingress 2.0.

122
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:29,640
Scott: Yeah.

123
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,220
Scott: There's no reason to play Ingress when Pokemon Go comes around.

124
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,880
Rym: Because, I mean, we saw people at expo halls who tried to make games like Ingress, and they obviously all looked stupid or bad.

125
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:49,640
Rym: Ingress is actually the first long-standing AR game, augmented reality, for those of you who aren't paying attention, that actually succeeded to some degree, and no one else has made one.

126
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:55,620
Rym: So, Niantic is the only company in the world that has actual data on how well AR games work with modern technology.

127
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,620
Scott: I'm waiting for some real game company to buy Niantic, right?

128
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,680
Scott: Nintendo could buy them, you know?

129
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,660
Rym: Well, they're owned by Alphabet, Google's parent company.

130
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,120
Scott: I thought that they weren't part of Alphabet at all anymore.

131
00:06:06,844 --> 00:06:07,270
Rym: I'm not 100% sure.

132
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,160
Scott: I thought that they were completely separate.

133
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,360
Rym: Well, I'm not sure what is being split off completely independent, and what is just its own company.

134
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,200
Scott: Or maybe they are still on the Alphabet.

135
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,820
Rym: Yeah, that's technically owned by Alphabet.

136
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,200
Rym: I'm actually not clear on all that yet.

137
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,239
Scott: Alphabet's Google, by the way.

138
00:06:20,621 --> 00:06:21,187
Rym: Yeah.

139
00:06:21,308 --> 00:06:22,360
Rym: Listen to Monday GeekNights.

140
00:06:25,182 --> 00:06:29,260
Rym: But it's kind of interesting, too, that way, way back... It's one of our lost panels.

141
00:06:29,342 --> 00:06:30,080
Rym: We did this panel.

142
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:36,100
Rym: We called it "egregiously unrealized potential" at a PAX in, like, 2010.

143
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,700
Rym: Like, a long goddamn time ago.

144
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:39,700
Scott: And many of the things we asked for happened.

145
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,041
Rym: Yeah.

146
00:06:40,282 --> 00:06:48,740
Rym: I mean, this panel was so old that we had five or six slides dedicated to... Guys, there's this game called X-Com that none of you have played.

147
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:50,053
Rym: Oh, my God.

148
00:06:50,093 --> 00:06:50,599
Scott: Reboot it.

149
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,559
Scott: Well, you can play X-Com pretty easily right now.

150
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:53,616
Rym: Yup.

151
00:06:53,636 --> 00:06:53,698
Rym: Yup.

152
00:06:54,261 --> 00:07:03,579
Rym: And the culmination... Oh, yeah, we talked about bringing Star Wars and Free Space Shooters back, and now we got to leave Dangerous, and there's probably going to be a bunch of Star Wars games.

153
00:07:04,987 --> 00:07:06,020
Scott: Well, Star Wars is back.

154
00:07:06,602 --> 00:07:06,703
Rym: Yeah.

155
00:07:06,784 --> 00:07:08,459
Rym: But TIE Fighter came back on GOG.

156
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:10,517
Rym: That's often a precursor...

157
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,820
Scott: Yeah, but they're only going to make Rogue Squadrons.

158
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,520
Scott: They're not going to make new TIE Fighters.

159
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,085
Rym: You never know.

160
00:07:14,146 --> 00:07:15,299
Rym: I hold out hope.

161
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,520
Scott: Other people have been making Free Space Shooters, though.

162
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:18,841
Rym: True.

163
00:07:19,364 --> 00:07:22,860
Rym: But the entire panel culminated in the end.

164
00:07:23,141 --> 00:07:29,099
Rym: Our only actual point was the Pokemon MMO would literally change and possibly destroy the world.

165
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,900
Scott: Maybe this will half destroy the world.

166
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,020
Rym: This is phase one.

167
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,150
Scott: It's a sign of the end.

168
00:07:34,191 --> 00:07:35,020
Scott: It's not the end times.

169
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,080
Scott: It's not the final battle of Tarmen Gaiden.

170
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:41,100
Rym: I was about to say, we found the Horn of Valar, but no one blew it yet.

171
00:07:42,102 --> 00:07:43,520
Scott: It's a sign of the end times.

172
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,980
Rym: This isn't the One Ring.

173
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,600
Scott: It's like you got the prophecies, and suddenly some things in the prophecies start happening, but it's not everything yet.

174
00:07:50,701 --> 00:07:51,196
Scott: That's what this is.

175
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,460
Scott: It's like three goddamn false dragons.

176
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,660
Rym: All the babies on Earth were still born suddenly for some reason.

177
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,618
Scott: The room of Galv is empty, but we're still here.

178
00:08:04,224 --> 00:08:05,700
Rym: No more crickets or cicadas?

179
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:06,416
Scott: Cicadas.

180
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,720
Rym: It's kind of an aside of the book club, but someone tweeted at me.

181
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,019
Rym: They said something very profound.

182
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:17,858
Rym: "The Prince of Nothing is better, but I feel better after reading The Wheel of

183
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:18,259
Rym: Time.".

184
00:08:18,626 --> 00:08:18,897
Scott: Sure.

185
00:08:20,965 --> 00:08:22,000
Scott: So yeah, of course.

186
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:30,840
Rym: This game is not going to be the Pokemon MMO, but it is going to be, I think, the best augmented reality game to have ever been released in the world to date.

187
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:31,520
Scott: Yeah.

188
00:08:31,701 --> 00:08:32,398
Rym: That's my guess.

189
00:08:34,971 --> 00:08:35,859
Scott: I bet money's on that.

190
00:08:36,422 --> 00:08:38,659
Scott: If I could invest in Niantic, I would.

191
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:42,360
Rym: Part of the reason I played Ingress was because it was the first one.

192
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,150
Scott: Maybe they're hiring.

193
00:08:43,352 --> 00:08:43,899
Scott: Are they in New York?

194
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,560
Rym: I don't know where they're based.

195
00:08:45,965 --> 00:08:46,959
Rym: Actually, yeah, are they hiring?

196
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:51,720
Rym: Because that's actually an area of games that I have a lot of domain knowledge and expertise.

197
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,400
Scott: I have a feeling that they're in the other side of the country.

198
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:54,846
Scott: Yeah.

199
00:08:55,321 --> 00:08:57,440
Rym: It's hard to say, though, because Google does have some offices down here.

200
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,680
Scott: I have a feeling they're in the other side of the country.

201
00:08:59,126 --> 00:08:59,799
Rym: I will look that up.

202
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,577
Rym: A strong feeling.

203
00:09:01,001 --> 00:09:02,579
Rym: I will find out while we're doing the show.

204
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:02,851
Rym: Sure.

205
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,340
Scott: Also, I have a feeling that you don't work very few hours there.

206
00:09:06,163 --> 00:09:06,939
Rym: Yeah, but you know what?

207
00:09:07,141 --> 00:09:11,500
Rym: I'd be willing to work a lot more hours if I was making big tier for real game stuff.

208
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:17,640
Scott: I wouldn't, even though there would be one huge benefit of working there, which is play Pokemon Go fucking today.

209
00:09:18,112 --> 00:09:18,220
Rym: Yep.

210
00:09:18,762 --> 00:09:19,816
Rym: There's another benefit, too.

211
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,019
Scott: Just give myself all the Pokemon.

212
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,519
Rym: I was going to say, right click, oppress, add Pokemon, Spiritomb.

213
00:09:26,061 --> 00:09:26,726
Scott: Level 1,000 max stats.

214
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,192
Scott: Evie's maxed.

215
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,040
Scott: Six Spiritombs can't lose.

216
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:31,738
Scott: Ivy's maxed or whatever.

217
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,420
Scott: Oh, and then Rym, he levels himself up, but then I go to his account.

218
00:09:35,861 --> 00:09:36,440
Scott: All Geodudes.

219
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,518
Scott: My only question now.

220
00:09:38,024 --> 00:09:39,419
Scott: Rym captures a whole bunch of Pokemon.

221
00:09:39,623 --> 00:09:40,419
Scott: Next day, he wakes up.

222
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:40,757
Scott: He looks.

223
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,019
Scott: He's got five Geodudes.

224
00:09:42,684 --> 00:09:43,035
Scott: Can't lose.

225
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,660
Scott: He doesn't have the sixth Geodude.

226
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:46,794
Scott: I killed it.

227
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:54,800
Rym: My only question now is, will Dorkly/CollegeHumor continue Pokemon Rusty now?

228
00:09:55,121 --> 00:09:55,679
Scott: Why wouldn't they?

229
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,859
Rym: Because they haven't in a while.

230
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:57,658
Scott: No, they haven't.

231
00:09:58,027 --> 00:09:58,279
Scott: Oh, well.

232
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,740
Rym: But things of the day.

233
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:25,939
Rym: So, Gummergate is stupid, just in case, because apparently people who are fans of us didn't realize that that's the truth and we're mad a while ago and it was funny, but Jimmy Kimmel is like the second most mainstream, genero type of generic mainstream, boring humor in the world.

234
00:10:26,188 --> 00:10:26,417
Scott: Yes.

235
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:33,399
Rym: The only talk show type entertainer person who is more mainstream is a guy that neither one of us can remember his name.

236
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:34,298
Scott: So mainstream.

237
00:10:34,923 --> 00:10:35,858
Scott: The other Late Show guy.

238
00:10:36,286 --> 00:10:36,497
Scott: Yeah.

239
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:37,317
Rym: But.

240
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:39,159
Scott: That's not Colbert, the third one.

241
00:10:39,265 --> 00:10:39,377
Rym: Yeah.

242
00:10:39,441 --> 00:10:40,580
Rym: Well, Gobert is special.

243
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:47,938
Rym: Anyway, so apparently he made fun of Gomergate because they're morons, which already says one thing.

244
00:10:48,661 --> 00:10:51,780
Scott: I thought he was making fun of, I don't think this had anything to do with Gomergate.

245
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:56,460
Scott: I thought it was that he was making fun of people watching other people play video games.

246
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:02,760
Rym: Well, I think he also kind of made fun of gamer culture, which is, that's a mortal sin among the Gomergates.

247
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:12,480
Scott: It's like, yeah, he just doesn't understand why watching video games is interesting because he clearly doesn't play or understand video games, but yet he doesn't, you know, watching sports is okay.

248
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,800
Scott: We watch other people play football.

249
00:11:14,343 --> 00:11:14,938
Scott: The end.

250
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,040
Scott: That's the end of the argument.

251
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:16,375
Scott: Done.

252
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:22,075
Rym: But irrespective of what, how, why Gomergate got mad and started sending him death threats and shit.

253
00:11:23,121 --> 00:11:26,160
Rym: And he responded by reading all their death threats on the air.

254
00:11:26,304 --> 00:11:26,580
Scott: Of course.

255
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,098
Scott: That's what you do.

256
00:11:27,282 --> 00:11:27,819
Scott: That's what I would do.

257
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:28,740
Rym: Which infuriated them further.

258
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,760
Scott: Send me death threats to read on this podcast, please.

259
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,100
Rym: And the feedback loop is continuing to go, which says one thing.

260
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,700
Rym: Gomergate, you finally made it.

261
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:45,979
Rym: You're so mainstream that lame late night talk show people know what you are and are milking you for bits.

262
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:46,450
Rym: Yup.

263
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:52,416
Rym: That is the only thing that could make you more pathetic would be if grandma knows what you are.

264
00:11:53,361 --> 00:11:55,120
Scott: I mean, it's sort of done at this point.

265
00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:00,128
Scott: If you look, a lot of people like run the numbers on it and it's basically the number of people who are.

266
00:12:00,148 --> 00:12:01,360
Scott: Gomergate is so few people.

267
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:10,360
Rym: I saw a great analysis of the accounts that tweeted about it, that all, you know, that you could kind of pick the accounts from the kinds of things they tweeted that were all new, you know, eggs and whatever with anime avatars.

268
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,403
Rym: They print.

269
00:12:11,463 --> 00:12:13,479
Rym: like 90 percent of them have not tweeted in months.

270
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:14,879
Rym: It's pretty much dead.

271
00:12:15,361 --> 00:12:20,700
Rym: So this is Stimpy rubbing his butt on the grave anyway.

272
00:12:22,443 --> 00:12:25,260
Scott: So there's this guy, his YouTube account is called iBook guy.

273
00:12:25,641 --> 00:12:30,860
Scott: I don't know why it's called iBook guy, but anyway, he's a pretty smart dude and makes good YouTube videos.

274
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,737
Scott: And he's got a series of YouTube videos that has two parts so far and he's making more parts.

275
00:12:35,261 --> 00:12:50,280
Scott: And in these videos, he explains to you in great detail how old busted computers or old non-busted computers, depending on your point of view, you know, from like 70s, 80s level, you know, Apple twos, Atari, Commodores, even the NES, right?

276
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:59,399
Scott: How those computers with their limited capacity to process things were able to display fancy graphics on the screen.

277
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,716
Rym: These videos are amazing because...

278
00:13:02,622 --> 00:13:05,660
Scott: For people who didn't already know how these computers worked, right?

279
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:14,659
Scott: This will make you perhaps appreciate old computers and maybe want to learn to program them because, you know, you might think, well, what's the point of learning to program some old computer?

280
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,720
Scott: Well, first of all, it's really much easier to understand.

281
00:13:18,361 --> 00:13:22,820
Scott: And once you learn that, you'll realize, oh, a new computer really isn't that much different.

282
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:24,660
Scott: It's just got more bits available.

283
00:13:25,101 --> 00:13:35,679
Rym: And like old computers, like you had so few colors, you know, count the number of pixels on the screen, which was a small enough number back then that you could count them by hand if you wanted to.

284
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:49,397
Scott: I mean, while I technically learned to program on an Apple two with like, you know, turtle graphics, logo, whatever, I really programmed, I guess, Mac L2C's with Pascal

285
00:13:49,417 --> 00:13:49,678
Rym: and then I

286
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,299
Scott: even more really programmed on a TI-86 and a TI-86 is pretty much really similar to any of these things.

287
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,639
Rym: I learned all my actual programming.

288
00:13:59,861 --> 00:14:00,380
Rym: It's got a Z80 chip, right?

289
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,219
Rym: Yeah, like I did Q-basic, but it wasn't real.

290
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:09,459
Rym: When I had to make shit work on my TI-85, which was faster, the memory was faster, but it had less of that slow memory.

291
00:14:10,261 --> 00:14:15,440
Rym: I preferred the TI-85 in a lot of ways, but that was when I actually learned how to program.

292
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,300
Scott: Yes, I preferred my fixie to that geared bicycle.

293
00:14:18,662 --> 00:14:34,320
Rym: I wonder if anyone in my old neighborhoods, because I wrote a pretty popular physics thing for high school physics classes, but it had my name all over it and if you fucked with it at all, I had a lot of really obfuscated bullshit hidden around in there.

294
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,960
Rym: If you fucked with it, all it did was make like half the equations subtly wrong.

295
00:14:40,722 --> 00:14:40,851
Rym: Anyway.

296
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,460
Rym: Anyway, these videos are great though because I learned a lot from them actually.

297
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,320
Scott: I didn't know how all these computers work.

298
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:50,039
Scott: I knew some of the things he was talking about, but not all of them.

299
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,700
Scott: But it's explained at a level- Like, when have I ever done graphics programming on a Commodore?

300
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,360
Scott: My cousins had Commodores, I didn't have one.

301
00:14:55,460 --> 00:15:03,940
Rym: The thing about that, Scott and I both learned stuff, and yet it's explained at a level that you will understand this if you have almost no knowledge of computers.

302
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:11,960
Scott: This is the kind of stuff where you'll realize, like if you're not sure if you like programming, if these videos interest you, then you probably will.

303
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,499
Rym: You'll love the shit out of programming if these are interesting to you.

304
00:15:14,742 --> 00:15:14,935
Rym: Right.

305
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:18,120
Rym: Also, a sprite on an NES is actually a bunch of sprites.

306
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:23,938
Scott: And even if you just care about games only, you'll really appreciate what it took to program those old games.

307
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:30,738
Rym: But, again, just count the number of pixels on the screen, multiply that by the number of bits you need to determine one color versus the other.

308
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:37,098
Scott: Then go look at a game like Kirby's Adventure or Mario 3 and realize what they had to do to make that game happen, and look how perfect the game is.

309
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:42,700
Rym: In the meta moment, I gotta pick a new Book Plug book.

310
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:48,399
Rym: We just did the Book, well, we're doing the Book Club episode on Thursday this week.

311
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,613
Scott: Aren't we uploading that tonight, which is...

312
00:15:52,782 --> 00:15:52,850
Rym: Why?

313
00:15:53,141 --> 00:15:55,039
Rym: Because it was a Monday, Wednesday week.

314
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:55,757
Scott: Oh, it was.

315
00:15:56,003 --> 00:15:56,117
Scott: Okay.

316
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:59,980
Rym: We're recording a lot of episodes way in advance because I'm in Singapore or Sydney.

317
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,257
Scott: We are recording this on Thursday, September 10th.

318
00:16:03,302 --> 00:16:09,780
Scott: We're probably uploading it on Thursday, September 11, 12, 13, 15?

319
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,600
Rym: Yep, 15.

320
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:10,691
Scott: Okay.

321
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:11,520
Rym: Yeah.

322
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,339
Rym: Dateline, of course.

323
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,660
Rym: So I haven't picked a new Book Club book, but we did the episode on The Wheel of Time.

324
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:22,059
Rym: The current book club is done and will be up on Thursday this week.

325
00:16:23,101 --> 00:16:26,618
Rym: And I have not picked a new book yet because I'm going to keep reading The Wheel of Time for a while.

326
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:27,362
Rym: So...

327
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,840
Scott: The Wheel of Time goes ride and ride.

328
00:16:29,104 --> 00:16:29,169
Rym: Yep.

329
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,619
Rym: Moderate hiatus there.

330
00:16:32,043 --> 00:16:33,279
Rym: We're back from PAX, obviously.

331
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:39,515
Rym: Hopefully, before I leave for Asia Pacific, I'll have at least one of the things we did at PAX.

332
00:16:39,942 --> 00:16:42,800
Rym: Probably our lectures, sports, or games on YouTube.

333
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,920
Rym: Maybe it'll be done by the time this episode airs and then I'll link to it.

334
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:50,059
Rym: And if it isn't linked to, it means I didn't finish it by then.

335
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:50,710
Scott: Oops.

336
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:55,360
Rym: And otherwise, pretty much in October, GeekNights will resume like normal.

337
00:16:55,921 --> 00:16:59,599
Rym: And once the weather gets too shitty to bike, videos are going to start coming out again.

338
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:00,087
Scott: Maybe.

339
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,600
Rym: They better.

340
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,339
Rym: We got to make videos.

341
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,499
Rym: People are really gunning for more Utena.

342
00:17:05,163 --> 00:17:06,299
Scott: Well, they can watch Utena.

343
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:06,749
Scott: Yeah.

344
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:16,140
Rym: So I was going to get into Rocket League and Scott kept saying he refused to pay that much money for a game that might be a flash in the pan.

345
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,099
Scott: Yeah, kept saying.

346
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,339
Scott: I said it one time.

347
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,520
Rym: You said it several times.

348
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,400
Scott: I said, "Huh, this game's 20 bucks.

349
00:17:21,683 --> 00:17:21,949
Scott: I don't

350
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:22,257
Scott: know.".

351
00:17:22,421 --> 00:17:23,597
Rym: And I would say, "It's worth

352
00:17:23,739 --> 00:17:23,779
Rym: it.".

353
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:24,517
Rym: And you'd say, "No, I'm not

354
00:17:24,537 --> 00:17:24,660
Rym: paying.".

355
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,760
Scott: You said, "It's worth it," knowing nothing about the game whatsoever.

356
00:17:27,025 --> 00:17:27,178
Rym: Yeah.

357
00:17:27,587 --> 00:17:27,737
Rym: Yeah.

358
00:17:27,904 --> 00:17:28,319
Rym: I was right.

359
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:33,076
Scott: Okay, so of course the game continued for another couple weeks and I said,

360
00:17:33,157 --> 00:17:33,518
Scott: "Hmm.".

361
00:17:34,161 --> 00:17:35,648
Scott: And Videoball did not appear.

362
00:17:35,768 --> 00:17:39,130
Scott: and I watched some videos of Rocket League and I said, "You know, it's a basic 3D

363
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:39,878
Scott: Videoball.".

364
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:40,338
Rym: Yup.

365
00:17:40,941 --> 00:17:43,580
Rym: Or one could say Videoball is a 2D Rocket League.

366
00:17:43,701 --> 00:17:45,160
Rym: You know, I'm like- Except Videoball is shooting.

367
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:45,667
Scott: Sure.

368
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,160
Scott: But it's like, "All right.

369
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,719
Scott: Well, this seems to be a thing.

370
00:17:50,345 --> 00:17:51,676
Scott: Let is my duty to see this

371
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:52,019
Scott: thing.".

372
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,039
Scott: And then, "Yeah, it's a real deal thing.

373
00:17:55,285 --> 00:17:56,119
Scott: Get in on it now.

374
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,615
Scott: It's still the early times

375
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:57,898
Scott: yet.".

376
00:17:58,189 --> 00:17:58,320
Rym: Yeah.

377
00:17:58,741 --> 00:18:07,380
Rym: If you join a matchmaking game, Rando, right now, actually, there are enough people who suck at this game to where you can play and have fun and learn to get better.

378
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,319
Rym: It's not like MOBAs.

379
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,159
Scott: Well, I mean, yeah.

380
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:13,038
Scott: It's like, imagine if you started playing MOBAs when Dota was just a Warcraft 3 mod.

381
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:17,280
Scott: That's would be the same thing as if you started playing this now.

382
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:17,695
Scott: I mean, yes.

383
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,920
Scott: This has been around for a while.

384
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,197
Scott: There was a predecessor game made by the same company that was like something something battle cars.

385
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,445
Scott: And then Rocket League's been around for- Right.

386
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,118
Scott: So Rocket League's been around for a little while yet.

387
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,999
Scott: But even so, this game is still young.

388
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,980
Scott: But it's like the fuse has been ignited and it's getting very close to the dynamite.

389
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,460
Scott: But it hasn't quite touched the dynamite.

390
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,180
Scott: It's like it's getting real close to the dynamite.

391
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,359
Scott: You can get in and be a part of the explosion if you start playing now.

392
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:56,859
Rym: And you know, actually, the game is because it's a dexterity, physical sport kind of game, as opposed to a MOBA, which is a lot more about knowledge.

393
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:02,554
Rym: You can actually just get better at it by practicing without anyone telling you what to do.

394
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:02,970
Rym: Right.

395
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,460
Rym: And the game has good tutorials.

396
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,820
Rym: So you can actually just play.

397
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,680
Scott: Well, tutorials are good at what they do teach you, but they leave a lot of stuff out.

398
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:17,339
Rym: But anyway, so what is to tell you if you don't know what Rocket League is, which scarily a lot of our listeners didn't like, I streamed it and half the people were like, whoa, what's this game?

399
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,378
Rym: So guys, come on.

400
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,180
Scott: Rocket League is the hot new game.

401
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:22,039
Scott: The way the game works is pretty simple.

402
00:19:22,201 --> 00:19:26,020
Scott: There is soccer, a ball and nets.

403
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,760
Scott: But the nets are at the edge of the field, just like soccer.

404
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,918
Scott: However, there's no out of bounds because the entire field is encased with walls, even a ceiling.

405
00:19:36,205 --> 00:19:37,179
Scott: So you can't leave the field.

406
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:38,780
Scott: So you don't worry about out of bounds.

407
00:19:39,223 --> 00:19:40,380
Scott: The game doesn't stop playing.

408
00:19:40,522 --> 00:19:41,460
Rym: And you play three on three.

409
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,260
Rym: There are other options.

410
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,640
Scott: Three on three soccer because the field is so big.

411
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:49,639
Scott: And, you know, if you have a full set of soccer players like winning eleven, it's like you watch a soccer match.

412
00:19:50,142 --> 00:19:53,728
Scott: Most of the soccer players just standing like at midfield while the ball is like near the net.

413
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,680
Scott: You know, it's like they don't have anything to do with the play over there.

414
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,579
Scott: They're in their position was three on three.

415
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,060
Scott: Everyone's got, you know, a relative amount of action all the time.

416
00:20:01,661 --> 00:20:06,280
Scott: You know, you can still like pass center it to your teammate in the middle and go for the goal and whatnot.

417
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:10,980
Scott: But, you know, it is not so many players on the field that it's too crazy.

418
00:20:11,542 --> 00:20:13,574
Scott: But there's not not enough players that it's like.

419
00:20:13,655 --> 00:20:14,359
Scott: you're just two people.

420
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,958
Scott: You can play one on one, but it sucks.

421
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,678
Rym: Two on two is pretty fun.

422
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:18,316
Scott: Two on two is OK.

423
00:20:18,482 --> 00:20:19,099
Scott: I like three on three.

424
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:19,776
Scott: The real mode.

425
00:20:20,201 --> 00:20:20,480
Rym: One on one.

426
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:26,858
Rym: I'd like to see two pros play one on one just to see if there's anything because other than just get past the guy, like, I don't know.

427
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:27,147
Rym: Yeah.

428
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:30,859
Rym: Anyway, it could be real like clever duel of wits.

429
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:31,878
Scott: It definitely could be.

430
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,160
Scott: But so the catch in Rocket League is, of course, the rocket aspect.

431
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,860
Scott: You are not a person playing soccer.

432
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,700
Scott: You're a car playing soccer, like an RC cars.

433
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:49,920
Scott: Well, there are arguments as to question whether are they full sized cars with a giant ball or are they tiny cars like RC cars with a normal sized ball?

434
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,360
Rym: And the game gives you no context to figure that out.

435
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,960
Scott: Well, you can see like the stands, right?

436
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,840
Scott: I like the only real world size reference are like the audience, the crowds.

437
00:20:59,382 --> 00:21:02,000
Scott: But they're so far away from the stadium.

438
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,960
Scott: You can't tell if they're like, you know what?

439
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,660
Rym: They're not far away.

440
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,318
Rym: You're just tiny.

441
00:21:05,823 --> 00:21:06,958
Scott: Or is it a tiny car?

442
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:07,959
Rym: It's hard to say.

443
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,619
Scott: Or is it a bit a full sized car?

444
00:21:10,501 --> 00:21:15,598
Rym: It'll be interesting when the world gets to the point to where Rocket League is a physical game.

445
00:21:15,681 --> 00:21:16,980
Scott: Well, think about the rules of physics.

446
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:22,200
Scott: If you had a rocket on a tiny car, you just go so far so fast, you just like explode immediately.

447
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,938
Scott: The car has to have some amount of... No, it doesn't.

448
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,140
Rym: I did model rocketry.

449
00:21:26,982 --> 00:21:30,980
Rym: You can put rockets on little things like that just fine to be easier.

450
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,180
Rym: Bigger rockets can't accelerate quickly.

451
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:39,540
Rym: If you have a big ass rocket, it can't go from nothing to into the air.

452
00:21:40,002 --> 00:21:41,819
Rym: It'll sit there for a long time.

453
00:21:42,441 --> 00:21:43,440
Scott: Anyway, it's a tiny.

454
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,178
Scott: So you're in a car.

455
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,799
Scott: So you're like, well, how do you play soccer in a car?

456
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,040
Rym: Well, I can crash into that ball.

457
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,398
Scott: You just crash into the ball, punch it, basically.

458
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:51,140
Scott: You can sort of dribble it, right?

459
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,259
Scott: If you drive into it slowly, it'll go bump, bump, bump.

460
00:21:53,763 --> 00:21:55,300
Scott: You can smash it against the wall.

461
00:21:55,705 --> 00:21:58,279
Scott: You can also... There's a jump button so you can jump.

462
00:21:58,761 --> 00:22:03,131
Scott: And then once you've jumped, you have three seconds, if you're still in the air, to jump again.

463
00:22:03,761 --> 00:22:08,520
Scott: And if you jump again, you could just do a double jump, but you can also point in a direction from your second jump.

464
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,740
Rym: Back to the side.

465
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,420
Scott: Forward, back, side, diagonal.

466
00:22:11,561 --> 00:22:13,380
Scott: And that second jump has some oomph to it.

467
00:22:13,645 --> 00:22:14,419
Scott: It's called a dodge.

468
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,019
Scott: So you can get some oomph on the ball.

469
00:22:16,361 --> 00:22:22,540
Scott: And you can also use this like lunge down the field very quickly to go backwards while still facing forwards.

470
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:29,220
Scott: Like if you need to get back in your net to defend, you could just do a backwards dodge, get right back in your net, but you're still facing forward.

471
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,560
Rym: Or half the time because you're panicking, jumping the wrong direction.

472
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:32,460
Scott: Of course.

473
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:36,240
Scott: The game is very precise with the controls on the gamepad.

474
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,760
Rym: So it gives you a lot.

475
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,880
Rym: It's a lot of physics play.

476
00:22:40,124 --> 00:22:45,200
Scott: A lot of analog control of the throttle forward and reverse and your angles and everything.

477
00:22:45,801 --> 00:22:49,400
Rym: You can rotate in full six degrees of freedom at any point.

478
00:22:50,623 --> 00:22:52,840
Rym: And you also have a rocket boost that you can activate.

479
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,019
Scott: That's why it's rocket league.

480
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,119
Scott: So you have this rocket.

481
00:22:55,321 --> 00:22:58,980
Scott: So the thing with the rocket is that you could just press the rocket button to go fast.

482
00:22:59,482 --> 00:23:07,780
Scott: But just doing that isn't really always the greatest idea because you can just use the dodge to go basically just as fast if you're just trying to get down the field or whatever.

483
00:23:08,663 --> 00:23:12,839
Scott: Uh, so it's very, it's only has limited use on the ground, but you really use it.

484
00:23:12,879 --> 00:23:18,480
Scott: for is you jump and then you use the analog stick to aim your car up and then you press rocket.

485
00:23:18,984 --> 00:23:20,580
Scott: And now you're a rocket.

486
00:23:21,201 --> 00:23:25,500
Scott: It's not flying like a plane or like a helicopter or anything like that.

487
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:34,838
Scott: It's like flying a rocket, like an Apollo five rock, you know, if you spiral out of control, you look like a rocket that spirals out of control is going to land in the ocean and explode.

488
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,952
Rym: Now, this is what pushes the game into an upper tier.

489
00:23:36,992 --> 00:23:46,100
Rym: that makes it really viable as a sport that if you play without the boost and the boost isn't there, the game is already a really good, really fun, really skill based game.

490
00:23:46,160 --> 00:24:02,157
Scott: And when you play with people who are of a low skill level, when you're first starting out, people aren't using the rocket to go in the air very much because as difficult as the game is on the ground, going into the air and being able to hit the ball while it's in the air, moving precisely, you're just going to miss the ball 99.9% of the time.

491
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:10,439
Scott: And even if you hit it, it's going to go not where you want it to go 100% of the time, 100% of the time, it's going to go where you don't want it to go.

492
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:10,761
Rym: So

493
00:24:10,921 --> 00:24:35,400
Scott: going up into the air and in the game and being effective at doing so is so such a even the most basic thing of get in the air, hit the ball that's in the air towards the just in the direction of the other enemy's goal, not even not even a shot on the goal, but just towards their end of the field is so difficult that in low level play, people don't even attempt that most basic aerial maneuver very often.

494
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:42,938
Scott: So that non rocket fun game is the game you're going to play when you're first starting out because no one's going up in the air.

495
00:24:43,581 --> 00:24:48,920
Rym: So the end of the sum of all this is that the game is actually just really stupid fun.

496
00:24:49,741 --> 00:24:54,940
Rym: And what I found once I went through the tutorials and got reasonably competent, Scott's about 10 times better than me right now.

497
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:55,526
Scott: And I'm still.

498
00:24:55,606 --> 00:24:56,680
Scott: I'm still garbage.

499
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:59,400
Rym: Scott's plays about 10 times more than I'm 10 times better than him.

500
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,900
Scott: And I'm garbage, which means Rym is poop.

501
00:25:02,782 --> 00:25:06,440
Scott: You and when we both started, we were both worse than poop.

502
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,920
Rym: The streaming I did was literally the third time I'd ever played the game and it shows.

503
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:16,325
Scott: But go watch some pros play and it's like it looks like a completely different game because they're so good.

504
00:25:16,345 --> 00:25:21,179
Scott: They can just go up in the air whenever they want, hit the ball exactly where they want, when they want all the time.

505
00:25:21,722 --> 00:25:22,326
Scott: It's ridiculous.

506
00:25:22,508 --> 00:25:24,200
Rym: The game is perfectly fair.

507
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,240
Rym: It has a bunch of DLC and stuff, but none of it affects gameplay in any way.

508
00:25:27,461 --> 00:25:30,520
Scott: Everything that you know, this DLC is purely cosmetic.

509
00:25:30,661 --> 00:25:32,520
Scott: There is no gameplay affecting anything.

510
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,299
Scott: Everyone's on a perfectly even playing field.

511
00:25:34,643 --> 00:25:35,919
Scott: No matter what your car looks like.

512
00:25:36,422 --> 00:25:38,260
Scott: As far as I can tell, the hitbox is the same.

513
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,111
Scott: The speed is the same.

514
00:25:39,131 --> 00:25:39,780
Scott: The jump is the same.

515
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,487
Scott: Everything's the same.

516
00:25:40,993 --> 00:25:41,579
Scott: So it doesn't matter.

517
00:25:42,924 --> 00:25:43,125
Rym: Yep.

518
00:25:43,145 --> 00:25:44,030
Rym: And I just like.

519
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:47,020
Rym: it's really quick that you start playing and you're just join a match, immediately play.

520
00:25:47,381 --> 00:25:49,880
Scott: It's really easy to match last five minutes.

521
00:25:49,921 --> 00:25:51,040
Scott: You can forfeit if you're losing.

522
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:51,794
Scott: No problem.

523
00:25:51,855 --> 00:25:52,019
Scott: Yep.

524
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,719
Rym: Overtime is just golden goal.

525
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:54,282
Scott: Yep.

526
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:55,840
Scott: It's it's real simple.

527
00:25:56,343 --> 00:25:57,139
Scott: It's crazy fun.

528
00:25:57,241 --> 00:25:58,259
Scott: You get crazy excitement.

529
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:05,480
Scott: You know, everything is exciting about sports plays that like replays that look astonishing because some guy did some amazing save or an amazing shot.

530
00:26:05,962 --> 00:26:11,660
Scott: You know, the excitement of just playing any kind of game where you put a ball on a net, but it's fast paced, unlike soccer.

531
00:26:11,762 --> 00:26:12,717
Scott: So it's not boring ever.

532
00:26:13,161 --> 00:26:18,799
Scott: And there's no penalties or play stoppages because you can't commit a penalty because it's a video game.

533
00:26:19,562 --> 00:26:23,180
Rym: And unlike a lot of other esports, like MOBAs are bullshit.

534
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:25,620
Rym: The game actually has a pretty good spectation.

535
00:26:25,681 --> 00:26:27,099
Rym: Like the spectation was built in.

536
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,320
Scott: It's not perfect yet, but they vastly improved it.

537
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,436
Scott: There's a patch today.

538
00:26:30,518 --> 00:26:30,660
Scott: Right.

539
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:37,640
Scott: So you look at every video game ever and go to the sub Reddit for that video game and you'll see there's usually like common complaints with the game.

540
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:42,104
Scott: I mean, this goes back for as long as there have been online forums, typical complaints about a game.

541
00:26:42,144 --> 00:26:44,580
Scott: But usually those complaints go unaddressed.

542
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,915
Scott: Hearthstone does not have extra deck slots or counter strike.

543
00:26:47,955 --> 00:26:48,879
Scott: still has the AWP.

544
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:54,260
Rym: Well, there's the side thing of sometimes those complaints are stupid, but they get addressed running the game.

545
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,264
Rym: Like tribes two.

546
00:26:56,007 --> 00:27:02,680
Scott: In this, there were pretty much not very many complaints that people had with Rocket League and they were all perfectly reasonable.

547
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:03,040
Scott: Right.

548
00:27:03,101 --> 00:27:10,660
Scott: People wanted to be able to join a new game immediately after finishing one without having to go exit to the main menu and join again.

549
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,100
Rym: There's always one jackass who doesn't say keep playing.

550
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:17,560
Scott: So you sit there and wait, you know, and things of small things of that nature.

551
00:27:17,881 --> 00:27:18,082
Scott: Right.

552
00:27:18,122 --> 00:27:23,279
Scott: People wanted and there were some bugs like there's a map where you could like get outside the wall.

553
00:27:23,802 --> 00:27:27,859
Scott: They released a patch today of this as of this recording, which is September 10th.

554
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:33,719
Scott: They addressed every one of these perfectly reasonable issues that people wanted fixed and they're all fixed now.

555
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:36,920
Rym: They also let me block PS4 people because the game's also on the PlayStation.

556
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,019
Scott: Yes, you can play on PlayStation four or PC.

557
00:27:39,441 --> 00:27:41,280
Scott: It's apparently twenty bucks on steam.

558
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,613
Scott: You can wait for a steam sale.

559
00:27:42,715 --> 00:27:43,119
Scott: But why?

560
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:47,880
Rym: Yeah, they are apparently going to release it for OS X and Linux as well via steam.

561
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:48,322
Scott: Nice.

562
00:27:48,503 --> 00:27:48,786
Scott: Yeah.

563
00:27:48,846 --> 00:27:50,460
Scott: But here's why I say pay 20 bucks for this.

564
00:27:50,560 --> 00:28:02,400
Scott: And even if it's a steam sale later, don't regret it, because what you're going to do to make up for that money you spent on Rocket League is be is not by Fallout four until it comes out with a complete game of the year edition.

565
00:28:02,742 --> 00:28:04,820
Scott: All DLC is 10 bucks steam sale.

566
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:18,080
Scott: And then that 40 bucks you save or even more on Fallout four will be the money you spent on Rocket League with money left over because, you know, and your money will go to this, you know, poor Rocket League game company instead of just OK for themselves.

567
00:28:18,401 --> 00:28:22,759
Scott: Sure, but not as well as, say, the fallout guys, but I don't need your money, guys.

568
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,559
Rym: Fallout can wait.

569
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,197
Rym: Rocket League is a multiplayer game.

570
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,365
Scott: That's exactly right.

571
00:28:28,385 --> 00:28:31,020
Scott: That's why you're doing this decision that I just told you to do.

572
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:34,720
Rym: Even if it dies amid a hoggy death, which it won't, I don't think.

573
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,363
Scott: I don't think so.

574
00:28:35,423 --> 00:28:38,540
Scott: I think this is going to always be not always.

575
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:38,924
Rym: It will.

576
00:28:38,964 --> 00:28:39,759
Rym: it'll eventually get on.

577
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:40,160
Scott: Sure.

578
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:47,920
Scott: I don't think that this is guaranteed to be a huge mega game, but it's going to be a big, important type e-sport.

579
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:48,282
Scott: Right.

580
00:28:48,303 --> 00:28:49,139
Rym: It'll have a long run.

581
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:49,620
Scott: Yes.

582
00:28:49,641 --> 00:28:53,904
Scott: It'll have a much longer run than, say, natural selection to did isn't right or anything like that.

583
00:28:54,247 --> 00:28:55,579
Scott: And that's still alive.

584
00:28:55,982 --> 00:28:56,630
Rym: Yeah, barely.

585
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:57,540
Rym: But it's on life support.

586
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,169
Rym: It's hanging in.

587
00:28:58,353 --> 00:28:58,699
Scott: It's there.

588
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,282
Scott: Is there.

589
00:28:59,523 --> 00:29:03,660
Scott: And this has, you know, thousands of players at all times or as NS2 did not.

590
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:07,460
Rym: Rocket League is the cool kid who just came to town and is actually really cool.

591
00:29:07,721 --> 00:29:08,005
Rym: Yes.

592
00:29:08,106 --> 00:29:09,260
Rym: Like you're actually getting along with him.

593
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,540
Scott: You're hanging out, you know, and you build your skills over time.

594
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,444
Scott: But it's much.

595
00:29:12,706 --> 00:29:15,440
Scott: it's weird in that it's a ridiculously difficult game.

596
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:21,500
Scott: To, you know, reach the top tiers, the skill cap is so high, but you just keep playing.

597
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:32,130
Scott: And even though I'm an old man and can't possibly get to that max skill cap, I keep getting better like and I as like every game I play, I jump a little higher and still accurately hit the ball.

598
00:29:32,577 --> 00:29:32,760
Scott: Right.

599
00:29:32,861 --> 00:29:36,500
Scott: Or, you know, score or contribute more to my team every single game I play.

600
00:29:36,921 --> 00:29:43,642
Scott: Whereas you play something like Street Fighter and you're going to hit a wall at some point where it's like, oh, I guess I can't execute this combo by pushing these buttons fast enough.

601
00:29:43,803 --> 00:29:47,728
Scott: Yeah, but it doesn't happen in Rocket League because you're just you know, you're driving this little car around.

602
00:29:47,768 --> 00:29:49,400
Scott: It's natural video game skills.

603
00:29:49,541 --> 00:29:50,631
Rym: Well, it has building them.

604
00:29:50,671 --> 00:29:51,640
Rym: It has good feedback.

605
00:29:51,941 --> 00:29:59,280
Rym: Like when you mess up, you really kind of you start to understand why it has a good loop of like learning the rumble and all the side stuff and the ball cam.

606
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:06,380
Rym: The fact that you can switch between looking straight ahead and a camera that floats a little back from your car and always points at the ball no matter where it is.

607
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:10,020
Scott: The original game that is based off the battle cars thing had so many modes.

608
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:15,162
Scott: And like while they develop that along the way, they develop like the Rocket League sort of mode.

609
00:30:15,504 --> 00:30:18,620
Scott: And then they realize, like, this is the fun part here.

610
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,505
Scott: This is way fun.

611
00:30:20,048 --> 00:30:22,320
Scott: And they just took that out and made it its own thing.

612
00:30:22,761 --> 00:30:26,520
Scott: And they worked on less stuff and polished it more, which is why Rocket League.

613
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:31,801
Scott: It's like you're like, I'm paying all that 20 bucks just this one like mode of another game.

614
00:30:31,842 --> 00:30:37,366
Scott: And it's like, yes, but this mode has been polished so shinally right that it's so perfected.

615
00:30:37,426 --> 00:30:38,820
Scott: It's not some janky thing, right?

616
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,707
Scott: Like it was originally.

617
00:30:39,748 --> 00:30:41,059
Scott: This is like the real deal.

618
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,227
Rym: Scott and I are going to play it enough.

619
00:30:42,268 --> 00:30:45,498
Rym: We just need a third person for our team and we're going to play competitively.

620
00:30:46,582 --> 00:30:48,319
Scott: Yeah, we don't have to win to play competitively.

621
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:53,850
Scott: I mean, I don't win that often in a runner, but I play that competitively if I can be in the top third someday.

622
00:30:55,801 --> 00:30:59,320
Scott: I mean, we're still in the bronze ranks, the silver and gold ranks.

623
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:03,040
Rym: We got to get our way up, but I'm going to try to be competent at this game.

624
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:03,362
Scott: I want to.

625
00:31:03,402 --> 00:31:07,840
Scott: if I can get into the silver ranks, I would be satisfied and be like, I am good enough at the Rocket League.

626
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,801
Scott: If I got to the gold ranks, I'd be like, well, I guess I kept playing Rocket League way too much.

627
00:31:12,081 --> 00:31:19,662
Rym: And I will commit to if you guys get into this game to form teams and will play with you.

628
00:31:19,682 --> 00:31:25,063
Rym: And I'd even be more than happy to set up a ladder or something in the Geek Knights forums.

629
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:29,899
Scott: I mean, there are even, you know, for big games, you know, like the Dodas and whatever of the world.

630
00:31:30,243 --> 00:31:31,660
Scott: Yeah, this is the real championship.

631
00:31:31,781 --> 00:31:34,260
Scott: So you can't possibly hope to compete in because it's not your job.

632
00:31:34,802 --> 00:31:39,425
Scott: But there are other tournaments all over the place like this, the recreational for DOTA that I know, like.

633
00:31:39,626 --> 00:31:41,460
Scott: I think it's like a game journalist tournament.

634
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,064
Scott: Like they're not.

635
00:31:42,225 --> 00:31:45,102
Scott: they're good, but they're not, you know, anywhere near professional good.

636
00:31:45,463 --> 00:31:52,240
Scott: But they still there are tournaments out there for people of lower skill levels that we can join with our team or set up or whatever.

637
00:31:52,442 --> 00:31:54,640
Scott: And I would be happy to get involved.

638
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:58,823
Scott: Then I would have a video game and I have a tabletop game for a competitive play and I'll be set.

639
00:31:59,105 --> 00:32:01,460
Rym: Yep, because video ball hasn't come out yet.

640
00:32:01,601 --> 00:32:05,020
Scott: I have my Rocket League in my video games when I'm home and nothing to do.

641
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:08,803
Scott: And then I'd have my net runners for when I'm out and about and there's someone to play net runner with.

642
00:32:09,065 --> 00:32:12,799
Rym: It's been a long time since I sat down to play a game and just didn't notice how long I had been playing it.

643
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,552
Rym: That's that's what I can say about Rocket League.

644
00:32:14,572 --> 00:32:15,740
Scott: is you just keep joining another one.

645
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,260
Scott: And now you can play even faster because you have to exit to the main menu.

646
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,400
Rym: Yeah, I'm a I'm really feeling this game like I'm having a lot of fun with this game.

647
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:27,139
Rym: It reminded me what it feels like to play that kind of mastery action game.

648
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:31,480
Scott: It's like I could have just gone back to Counter Strike and it would have been which I was doing until Rocket League.

649
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:35,060
Scott: But I'm you know, I'm getting better at Rocket League.

650
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,000
Scott: At Counter Strike, I think I'm as good as I'm going to get, which is not good enough.

651
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:38,864
Rym: You were never that good.

652
00:32:38,884 --> 00:32:45,400
Rym: I mean, I'm not good at Counter Strike, but I'm easily like I'm more better than you at Counter Strike than you were better than me at Rocket League.

653
00:32:46,102 --> 00:32:46,385
Scott: I don't know.

654
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:47,700
Scott: I haven't played Counter Strike in so long.

655
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,683
Rym: That's your problem.

656
00:32:48,724 --> 00:32:48,985
Rym: You don't.

657
00:32:49,025 --> 00:32:52,885
Rym: you don't even know like the corners or anything in new Counter Strike.

658
00:32:52,905 --> 00:32:54,520
Rym: No, you don't know the maps.

659
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,100
Scott: Maybe if I go back and play 1-6 or 1-0 the Counter Strike when I was good.

660
00:32:58,381 --> 00:33:02,100
Rym: Yeah, the only people who still play 1-6 are all invincible Neos.

661
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,212
Scott: Oh, well, that sucks.

662
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:03,700
Scott: Or cheaters.

663
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,960
Rym: And no one plays Source because Source is the worst Counter Strike.

664
00:33:08,104 --> 00:33:09,420
Rym: Yeah, like play Rocket League.

665
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,183
Rym: It's legit.

666
00:33:11,008 --> 00:33:12,979
Rym: And we're going to stream and play a whole bunch of it.

667
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,320
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

668
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:26,439
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

669
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:31,860
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

670
00:33:32,122 --> 00:33:34,780
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

671
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:39,540
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

673
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,300
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

674
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,480
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
