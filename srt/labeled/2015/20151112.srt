1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,872
Rym: It's Thursday, November 12th, 2015.

2
00:00:12,872 --> 00:00:15,900
Rym: I'm Rym, and this is GeekNights Tonight.

3
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:21,140
Rym: The Patrons got to pick the topic, and the topic is food related.

4
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:23,978
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:36,586
Rym: So way back at PAX, we met a friend, cool game guy, and the game guy knew that I played Civ 5 and invited me to play a GMR game of Civ 5.

6
00:00:36,586 --> 00:00:37,800
Rym: Giant multiplayer robot.

7
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:54,220
Rym: That's that thing that'll basically, instead of using Pit Boss or all the janky ways that Civ 5 actually does that that seem to have problems, it basically just, you play your turn, hot seat, and then it automatically takes the save file, does everything to arrange everything.

8
00:00:54,340 --> 00:01:01,200
Rym: It's like I get a notification on the desktop, I launch Civ 5, I take my turn, and everything's just handled and it just works.

9
00:01:02,161 --> 00:01:05,697
Rym: And this was way back after PAX Prime, and I was too busy, so I was like, "Sorry, I can't join this

10
00:01:05,717 --> 00:01:05,918
Rym: game.".

11
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:22,136
Rym: A few days ago, and it's been a long time since PAX Prime, a second game is starting up, because that first one I think is winding down, or has ended, so that's about how long these games take, I think, and I've joined it, and so far I've taken two turns in this.

12
00:01:23,682 --> 00:01:25,860
Scott: You built your settlement with your settler.

13
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:30,260
Rym: Which is fucking bullshit, because I'm the Ottomans, and I didn't start on a coast.

14
00:01:30,923 --> 00:01:32,791
Scott: And then you moved your worker, maybe got him started working.

15
00:01:35,422 --> 00:01:36,247
Rym: I'm not a worker.

16
00:01:36,267 --> 00:01:38,080
Rym: You don't start with a worker.

17
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,180
Scott: No, you got a warrior.

18
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,260
Rym: Yeah, I got a warrior.

19
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,717
Rym: I moved my warrior north, and then north again, and I did find a ruin.

20
00:01:46,737 --> 00:01:47,540
Rym: They're not called huts.

21
00:01:48,702 --> 00:01:49,998
Rym: So I'm headed toward that ruin.

22
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:50,580
Scott: I call them huts.

23
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,157
Rym: Yeah, because you played old Civs.

24
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,599
Scott: And what did you start producing in your settlement?

25
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,000
Rym: I started building a monument.

26
00:01:56,201 --> 00:01:56,839
Scott: Another warrior?

27
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,657
Rym: Nope, a monument.

28
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:58,144
Rym: Whoa.

29
00:01:58,741 --> 00:02:02,395
Rym: I'm going to some early culture, and I got to find a coast, or I'm done.

30
00:02:02,435 --> 00:02:02,756
Rym: I can't wait.

31
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,900
Scott: If you need to find a coast, shouldn't you build a warrior to explore more?

32
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,340
Rym: No, I would build a scout, which is what I'm building after I finish my monument.

33
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,780
Rym: I want the monument, so I'll start getting culture.

34
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:13,727
Scott: What do you got near you?

35
00:02:13,748 --> 00:02:14,540
Scott: Some horses, maybe?

36
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:16,660
Rym: I got a whole bunch of things that require calendars.

37
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:24,320
Rym: I got incense, and I think indigo or dyes, so I need a calendar.

38
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,748
Scott: That early game settlers.

39
00:02:25,768 --> 00:02:27,560
Scott: Not even thinking about tanks.

40
00:02:29,206 --> 00:02:29,700
Scott: Or radio.

41
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:36,439
Rym: But yeah, the Ottomans' power is basically, naval units don't cost you shit to maintain, so I really need to be on the coast.

42
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,699
Rym: That's like, that's it for me.

43
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,199
Rym: That's it for Turkey.

44
00:02:44,261 --> 00:02:47,719
Rym: So before we get into what we're actually doing the show on, Scott, you got any news?

45
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,519
Scott: So there's this dude, Robert Fidler.

46
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:51,365
Scott: Fidler?

47
00:02:51,385 --> 00:02:51,872
Scott: I don't know.

48
00:02:51,953 --> 00:02:52,500
Scott: He's an old dude.

49
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,000
Rym: Robert Fidler is a pretty good name.

50
00:02:54,161 --> 00:02:55,539
Scott: He's 66 old dude, right?

51
00:02:57,303 --> 00:02:59,679
Scott: And he, you know, he's the kind of person who knows how to build a house.

52
00:03:00,481 --> 00:03:02,229
Scott: And he lives in England, right?

53
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,280
Scott: In Surrey, Redhill, whatever.

54
00:03:07,643 --> 00:03:09,680
Scott: And, you know, he knows construction.

55
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:11,259
Scott: Obviously he's a retired old dude.

56
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:16,019
Rym: Obviously he built something crazy or a park-like story happened to him, is my guess.

57
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,580
Scott: So he knows that if you just build some random house, you can't just do that.

58
00:03:21,121 --> 00:03:22,619
Scott: He needs to be approved and whatnot.

59
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,399
Rym: I can't just like start throwing up a tree for it, like this is my house.

60
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:25,900
Scott: Right.

61
00:03:26,362 --> 00:03:31,380
Scott: So he built a giant pile of hay bales, you know, which is totally OK to have on your property.

62
00:03:31,584 --> 00:03:31,977
Scott: I guess.

63
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,320
Scott: If you have a big old property.

64
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:42,199
Scott: To hide the fact that behind the hay bales, he was building what can only be referred to as a castle.

65
00:03:43,102 --> 00:03:44,820
Rym: That is amazing.

66
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:51,260
Scott: So he built a castle, a mock Tudor castle behind this giant hay bale.

67
00:03:51,482 --> 00:03:52,819
Rym: Mock Tudor is like mock duck.

68
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,840
Scott: Yeah, to live in and be awesome.

69
00:03:56,482 --> 00:03:57,610
Scott: And he knew he wasn't supposed to do it.

70
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,080
Scott: That's why he put up a giant pile of hay bales.

71
00:03:59,661 --> 00:04:03,740
Scott: But he thought, you know, one of those people who sort of like thinks about these laws that don't exist.

72
00:04:04,381 --> 00:04:08,200
Scott: He thought that, like, if it existed for so many years that then they couldn't make him take it down.

73
00:04:08,763 --> 00:04:09,819
Rym: Are they making him take it down?

74
00:04:11,161 --> 00:04:15,139
Scott: So, yeah, eventually he took down his hay bales, like, oh, my castle's been here long enough, shove it.

75
00:04:16,101 --> 00:04:23,860
Scott: And so a high court judge agreed, saying he would be jailed for his defiance if the property is not demolished by June.

76
00:04:24,725 --> 00:04:25,659
Rym: That's so sad.

77
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,179
Rym: Like, on one hand, I want building codes.

78
00:04:29,001 --> 00:04:34,900
Rym: I don't want like the libertarian nightmare of people's houses just like burning down because they made him out of hay or whatever.

79
00:04:36,221 --> 00:04:39,720
Scott: But he used hay to hide an actual castle almost.

80
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:44,919
Rym: Yeah, but at the same time, I want people who want to do something cool like that to be able to do it.

81
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,447
Scott: Well, I guess he didn't do it properly.

82
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:51,120
Scott: He should have gotten permits and, you know, code inspections and all those sorts of things.

83
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:51,766
Scott: He could have done it.

84
00:04:52,353 --> 00:04:52,838
Scott: But he didn't.

85
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,680
Rym: Yeah, I wonder if this is going to end with him going to jail rather than tear down his castle.

86
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,800
Scott: I mean, I'm sure they're going to, if he goes to jail, they'll tear down the castle while he's in jail.

87
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:01,402
Rym: Maybe.

88
00:05:01,422 --> 00:05:04,860
Rym: I wonder if the locals will try to protect his castle.

89
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,120
Scott: I don't think they like the castle.

90
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,020
Rym: Or if he is the local crackpot.

91
00:05:08,463 --> 00:05:09,711
Scott: I'm pretty sure it's that one.

92
00:05:09,731 --> 00:05:10,839
Scott: That's the one.

93
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,760
Rym: So we have ideas for Thursdays and we forget them.

94
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:20,040
Rym: So whatever we were going to do this show on last week that we knew was like the best fucking idea for a Thursday show ever.

95
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,104
Rym: Can't remember it.

96
00:05:21,285 --> 00:05:22,333
Rym: So it's gone forever.

97
00:05:22,353 --> 00:05:23,259
Rym: We'll never do it now.

98
00:05:24,001 --> 00:05:30,460
Rym: But Scott had the good idea of let's ask the listener who's paying us on Patreon.

99
00:05:32,224 --> 00:05:34,640
Rym: Let him or her just pick what the show is.

100
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,480
Scott: This is a genius idea for many reasons.

101
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,651
Scott: Reason number one saves me a lot of work.

102
00:05:38,892 --> 00:05:40,400
Scott: I don't have to think up a stupid show idea.

103
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:45,180
Rym: Yeah, instead you sit here and bitch and argue about how all the ideas they submitted are impossible and we can't do them.

104
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:45,910
Scott: They're garbage ideas.

105
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:46,400
Scott: You guys suck.

106
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,160
Rym: I think they're great ideas and you guys are awesome.

107
00:05:49,005 --> 00:05:50,260
Scott: Rims is trying to curry favor.

108
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,064
Rym: Not one, I like curry.

109
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:57,340
Rym: And two, I think we could do a full 40 minute show on any of these topics.

110
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,244
Scott: I do not believe that.

111
00:05:58,987 --> 00:06:01,620
Scott: Also, it's the greatest scam in the earth.

112
00:06:01,801 --> 00:06:06,380
Scott: Just like running an orchard, apple orchard, and people pay you to go apple picking.

113
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,319
Scott: It's like they're paying you to do your job.

114
00:06:08,721 --> 00:06:11,559
Scott: You're paying me to tell me a show idea.

115
00:06:12,183 --> 00:06:12,679
Scott: Hey, Scott.

116
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,199
Scott: So I don't have to come up with one.

117
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:15,996
Scott: That is the greatest scam.

118
00:06:16,036 --> 00:06:16,380
Scott: Thank you.

119
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,019
Rym: You want to buy this monkey's paw right here?

120
00:06:19,341 --> 00:06:22,560
Rym: You're going to get exactly what you want from this monkey's paw.

121
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,378
Scott: It's like someone found a monkey's paw.

122
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,980
Scott: How many times can I use the monkey's paw?

123
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:30,120
Rym: They're like, I wish Rym and Scott would do an episode on zombies again.

124
00:06:31,066 --> 00:06:31,529
Scott: And you know what?

125
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,240
Scott: Fine, we'll do an episode on zombies again.

126
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,760
Scott: It'll be some shitty garbage episode.

127
00:06:35,221 --> 00:06:35,779
Rym: And the whole time?

128
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,458
Rym: You asked for it.

129
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,375
Rym: The whole time, you have to remember in your head, you wanted this.

130
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,060
Scott: Right, like if I just do a show and it's bad, then it's like you guys are like, guys, why'd you do that stupid show?

131
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:51,600
Scott: But if you tell me to do the stupid show and you pay me to do it and I do it and it's stupid, it's like, that's what you asked for.

132
00:06:52,202 --> 00:06:55,860
Scott: Now, what I'm actually really happy about- I'll be the monkey's paw rather than buying the monkey's paw.

133
00:06:56,101 --> 00:06:58,319
Rym: We got actually a lot of submissions.

134
00:06:59,373 --> 00:06:59,839
Scott: Quite a few.

135
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:08,960
Rym: Considering that I tweeted this like from work this morning and it's not that much later than when I tweeted it, we got a decent number of responses here.

136
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:18,620
Rym: The hitman very pointedly emailed me to say that he didn't submit pro wrestling to this because he doesn't want us to fuck it up basically by doing it unprepared.

137
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:23,780
Scott: I'm just going to talk about how it's fake and how it's hard to watch now that I'm old, but I understand it.

138
00:07:24,141 --> 00:07:28,100
Rym: I actually have a lot to say about what I liked about it when I was a kid.

139
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:34,993
Rym: I was weirdly a big fan of Jake the Snake and The Undertaker and The Ultimate Warrior.

140
00:07:35,074 --> 00:07:38,060
Rym: I was a fan of for some reason, but I never actually saw him wrestle.

141
00:07:39,161 --> 00:07:45,340
Rym: So I don't know why I like knew a lot about him because he was not on the TV in my wrestling era.

142
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,039
Rym: Like he was before my wrestling time.

143
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,560
Scott: I was the biggest fan of Legion of Doom because they had like these red things, all these spikes all over it and it was badass.

144
00:07:53,362 --> 00:08:00,279
Rym: See for some reason I like The Undertaker and I like the heels more than anything like I wanted bad guys to win all the time.

145
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:08,836
Rym: But anyway, so I didn't really come up with a rubric of how we were going to pick which of these shows to do and in the future.

146
00:08:08,937 --> 00:08:10,159
Rym: what I'm going to do is take...

147
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:19,420
Scott: I figured that like most of them would be garbage shows that we've either already done or won't be long enough topics or aren't good Thursday topics and then only have like one left.

148
00:08:20,021 --> 00:08:27,520
Rym: But what I want to do in the future probably is I'll do a two-step of first submit and then let's take them all and let everyone vote.

149
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:36,080
Rym: That way it'll force us like it'll be like we'll do a show on like the Baroque period of music because that's what you fuckers voted for.

150
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,328
Scott: I don't know anything about it.

151
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:38,580
Scott: Tell me a Baroque composer.

152
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:42,278
Rym: If it ain't Baroque.

153
00:08:42,721 --> 00:08:44,110
Scott: You don't know a single one Mr.

154
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:45,620
Scott: Music Study whatnot.

155
00:08:46,408 --> 00:08:46,731
Rym: I guess so...

156
00:08:48,863 --> 00:08:49,828
Scott: I know a lot of composers.

157
00:08:49,848 --> 00:08:51,800
Scott: I just don't know which ones are Baroque and which ones aren't.

158
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,779
Rym: You could do some Bach stuff like early Bach.

159
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:54,517
Scott: I like Bach.

160
00:08:55,283 --> 00:08:56,898
Rym: Yeah, name anything Bach ever did.

161
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,556
Rym: Also which Bach?

162
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,626
Rym: Which Bach?

163
00:09:00,847 --> 00:09:02,559
Rym: There's multiple Bachs.

164
00:09:03,281 --> 00:09:03,447
Scott: JSJ.

165
00:09:04,901 --> 00:09:07,119
Rym: Johann Sebastian J. Bach?

166
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,276
Scott: Joust Bach.

167
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:17,626
Rym: So next time I'll let you guys vote and just force us into one but what I decided to go with was.

168
00:09:17,646 --> 00:09:27,500
Rym: I looked at the list and if anything was mentioned more than once like vaguely like if a category got more suggestions than anything else I figured we'd do that.

169
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:36,560
Rym: And sure enough there's a category that got more suggestions within its broad stroke than anything else and that category was food.

170
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:41,020
Rym: Eisenrode suggested just cooking like in general.

171
00:09:41,603 --> 00:09:42,332
Scott: It's so general.

172
00:09:42,372 --> 00:09:42,898
Scott: What is there to say?

173
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,218
Rym: Favorite dishes, cooking related mayhem, etc.

174
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,400
Scott: I don't have too many.

175
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,282
Rym: I have a lot.

176
00:09:48,342 --> 00:09:54,420
Rym: Remember when Greg set that fire trying to fry an egg and the fire alarm went off and got kicked out of her apartment?

177
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,384
Scott: My favorite dishes.

178
00:09:55,424 --> 00:09:56,371
Scott: Go to fancy restaurant.

179
00:09:56,391 --> 00:09:57,015
Scott: Pay a lot of money.

180
00:09:57,075 --> 00:09:57,780
Scott: Everything's delicious.

181
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:05,860
Rym: Remember our an unnamed friend who didn't know what that hood over the stove was and when you're supposed to turn it on?

182
00:10:06,843 --> 00:10:07,287
Scott: Always.

183
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:08,377
Scott: With the stove just turn it on.

184
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:08,760
Scott: Why not?

185
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:10,665
Rym: Yeah.

186
00:10:10,725 --> 00:10:12,512
Rym: I got a lot of mayhem stories there.

187
00:10:13,475 --> 00:10:14,880
Rym: Blank suggested Thanksgiving.

188
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,598
Scott: That's the show we're gonna do.

189
00:10:17,344 --> 00:10:17,900
Rym: And George Patches.

190
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:23,620
Scott: I'm so sure that we had already done that show but we haven't and there's so much to talk about with that particular holiday.

191
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,955
Rym: George Patches said french fries.

192
00:10:26,781 --> 00:10:28,219
Scott: There's not that much to say about that.

193
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,940
Rym: I got a lot to say about french fries.

194
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:44,400
Scott: I know George Patches and I know he loves him a french fry and is actually, if you want to eat a french fry, him making you a french fry in your kitchen is second only to the best french fries you can buy.

195
00:10:45,405 --> 00:10:47,439
Rym: He's a man who respects the french fry.

196
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,959
Scott: He has practiced the making your french fry.

197
00:10:50,301 --> 00:10:50,883
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

198
00:10:51,023 --> 00:10:56,860
Rym: So, full disclosure, I've never myself deep fried anything in my life and I don't plan to ever.

199
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,020
Scott: I've done it very few times and very carefully.

200
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:05,820
Rym: I've been around other people doing it like my parents making donuts or I mean I've done shallow frying.

201
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,705
Scott: It's usually a bad idea.

202
00:11:06,765 --> 00:11:09,480
Scott: It's dangerous, messy and time consuming and difficult.

203
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:18,780
Rym: Well, wait till the day after Thanksgiving when there is the annual montage of people who burn their houses down trying to deep fry a turkey in the garage.

204
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,859
Scott: There are many mistakes that they make.

205
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,793
Rym: So, I do have some news and it's about french fries.

206
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:28,060
Rym: I'm going to make the french fries thing my news.

207
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,475
Scott: Instead of the topic, the news?

208
00:11:29,495 --> 00:11:29,678
Scott: Okay.

209
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:34,240
Rym: So, first off, Five Guys fries are not that good.

210
00:11:34,646 --> 00:11:35,120
Scott: No, they're not.

211
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:37,360
Scott: They're just greasy and kind of nasty.

212
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:42,500
Scott: They make a big deal about how they use peanut oil and they have all these peanuts all over the place.

213
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,040
Rym: And yeah, peanut oil is superior for making french fries but that doesn't make the Five Guys fries good.

214
00:11:46,201 --> 00:11:50,740
Scott: It is a very good choice for making french fries but Five Guys french fries is still not that good.

215
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,820
Scott: Oh, they also make a big deal about like all these Idaho potatoes they got in there.

216
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:54,088
Rym: Yup.

217
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:55,339
Scott: But they're not that good.

218
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,015
Rym: No, like the fries they're just like they're greasy.

219
00:11:58,035 --> 00:11:58,780
Rym: You know what they're like?

220
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:06,040
Rym: They're like the fries you get if you go to like a food fair and there's some good food and then they also have fries.

221
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,378
Rym: So, they're kind of like half acidly made at a stand.

222
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:15,900
Scott: You know, there are certain deep fried foods where you get them when they're immediately fried and they're amazing because it's hot oil of deliciousness.

223
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:19,036
Scott: But if you let them sit for even a second it's like, "Oh, these are just really

224
00:12:19,076 --> 00:12:19,539
Scott: garbagey.".

225
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,021
Rym: Yup.

226
00:12:20,283 --> 00:12:21,410
Rym: Like a deep fried Oreo?

227
00:12:21,853 --> 00:12:22,980
Rym: Do not let that get cold.

228
00:12:23,584 --> 00:12:23,760
Rym: Right.

229
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,000
Rym: Like if that is, just throw it away.

230
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:31,540
Scott: But there are other deep fried foods like say a really good fried chicken where that shit's good cold out of the fridge next day.

231
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:36,800
Rym: Oh my, so Dirty Bird which is a deep like a fried chicken place near our office.

232
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,019
Rym: Like I guess it's a chain or whatever but we go there kind of often.

233
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,280
Rym: I always would just get fried chicken which was kind of bad because I ate a ton of fried chicken.

234
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,099
Scott: You don't want to do that.

235
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,299
Rym: And then I fall asleep at my desk.

236
00:12:45,441 --> 00:12:47,412
Scott: I get fried chicken right on the corner of my street.

237
00:12:47,432 --> 00:12:48,840
Scott: I don't even have to cross the street to get to it.

238
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,600
Scott: I only go there like once a month at the most.

239
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,001
Rym: Yeah.

240
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:54,860
Rym: When I get fried chicken there I just fall asleep at my desk and like the whole day is ruined.

241
00:12:55,780 --> 00:13:02,860
Rym: But I noticed one day recently that on their menu they have sandwiches which like normally when you go to a place that is like a fried chicken.

242
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,608
Scott: I was just at Schnippers.

243
00:13:03,648 --> 00:13:04,700
Scott: I got the crispy chicken sandwich.

244
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,141
Rym: Yeah.

245
00:13:05,662 --> 00:13:11,440
Rym: But when you're at a place whose thing is something like Fuddruckers makes mediocre burgers to only get burgers there.

246
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:13,920
Rym: Or you know like a fried chicken place makes fried chicken.

247
00:13:14,483 --> 00:13:16,154
Rym: They had sandwiches heading in the menus.

248
00:13:16,174 --> 00:13:16,899
Rym: I always ignore it.

249
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,030
Rym: But I looked under the sandwiches.

250
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,560
Rym: They actually only have one sandwich.

251
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,319
Scott: Fried chicken sandwich.

252
00:13:21,641 --> 00:13:22,500
Rym: It's a fried chicken sandwich.

253
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:23,746
Rym: So I got it.

254
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,419
Rym: It's real good.

255
00:13:25,881 --> 00:13:26,158
Scott: Okay.

256
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,659
Rym: Dangerously good.

257
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,080
Rym: So I've been getting that now and I've been eating a lot of fried chicken.

258
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:30,620
Rym: Okay.

259
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,488
Rym: But McDonald's fries?

260
00:13:33,794 --> 00:13:34,940
Rym: I used to like them as a kid.

261
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,320
Scott: You're doing the french fry show instead of your french fry news.

262
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:38,146
Rym: It is my news.

263
00:13:38,187 --> 00:13:39,479
Rym: My news is that I'm doing the french fry show.

264
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,360
Scott: Well I thought you had some like actual french fry news.

265
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:43,727
Rym: I do but I'm going to get to that.

266
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:46,340
Rym: But McDonald's fries, this is my segue.

267
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,559
Rym: They were good when I was a kid and could still eat fast food.

268
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:56,599
Rym: But now that I don't go, like I have not had a McDonald's burger in many years.

269
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:57,659
Scott: I can't even remember.

270
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:58,423
Rym: Yeah.

271
00:13:58,544 --> 00:14:00,080
Rym: Like I do not eat that fast food.

272
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,559
Scott: It might even be like elementary school.

273
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,480
Rym: And the occasional time that I will eat that kind of fast food.

274
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:08,264
Scott: Oh I had one Burger King in the year like 2000.

275
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,399
Rym: Burger King is even worse.

276
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,265
Scott: It was at an airport.

277
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:11,614
Scott: It was Newark airport.

278
00:14:11,634 --> 00:14:12,620
Scott: There was literally no other food.

279
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,538
Rym: I would just not eat.

280
00:14:14,382 --> 00:14:15,660
Scott: I was getting on a very long flight.

281
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,971
Rym: I would still just not eat.

282
00:14:17,012 --> 00:14:17,900
Rym: I'd eat the airplane food.

283
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,400
Scott: But it wasn't really a good area.

284
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:26,020
Rym: I would eat the airplane food on a domestic American flight before I would eat anything from a Burger King.

285
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:27,442
Rym: Anyway.

286
00:14:28,044 --> 00:14:33,020
Rym: So as an adult, I ate like a McDonald's fry in the last couple of years.

287
00:14:34,141 --> 00:14:36,427
Rym: And if you're, I guess they're good.

288
00:14:36,448 --> 00:14:40,600
Rym: if you're able to eat shitty fast food and you crave that like.

289
00:14:41,003 --> 00:14:42,399
Scott: You just want some salt and oil.

290
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:42,761
Rym: Yeah.

291
00:14:42,801 --> 00:14:45,295
Rym: Like the thing in your brain that says potato chips are great.

292
00:14:45,315 --> 00:14:45,959
Rym: Just keep eating them.

293
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:49,980
Rym: Like that, you'll eat McDonald's fry and it'll taste real good.

294
00:14:51,221 --> 00:14:55,500
Rym: If you haven't eaten that shit in a while, they are so disgusting.

295
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:01,897
Rym: They taste like the kind of food that a dystopian future would feed to its like underclass slaves in the 1984 universe.

296
00:15:04,261 --> 00:15:08,380
Rym: So I basically only eat good french fries now, like Curly's fries on the shore.

297
00:15:08,681 --> 00:15:10,620
Rym: Like, you know, a real good french fry.

298
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,499
Scott: A french fry made by George Patches here.

299
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,680
Rym: So there's a story here and there's a bunch of like other articles related to it.

300
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,519
Rym: And basically the gist of it.

301
00:15:19,422 --> 00:15:22,360
Rym: Take this with a grain of salt because obviously it's a nutrition study.

302
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,499
Scott: I think you want to take more than a grain of salt on your french fries.

303
00:15:25,665 --> 00:15:26,439
Scott: Quite a few grains.

304
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,000
Rym: You got to have it on one of those plates that's made out of salt.

305
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,859
Rym: That's not really necessary.

306
00:15:32,881 --> 00:15:38,900
Rym: So it talks about how junk food, like garbage fast food, doesn't really correlate with obesity.

307
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,098
Rym: And there's a bunch of stuff about this.

308
00:15:41,163 --> 00:15:44,280
Rym: How its number of calories eaten matters a lot.

309
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:52,760
Rym: But thin people actually eat garbage food at about the same percentage of their total diet as obese people do.

310
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,380
Rym: And it has this whole thing.

311
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,240
Rym: But then at the bottom there's something very interesting.

312
00:15:58,081 --> 00:16:10,800
Rym: There's only one food where there is a difference in like the percentage of diet or like the frequency of eating between obese people, like morbidly obese people and normal people.

313
00:16:11,201 --> 00:16:12,900
Rym: And that is french fries.

314
00:16:13,941 --> 00:16:17,399
Rym: Only french fries are statistically significant there.

315
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:25,000
Rym: People, quote, the study showed morbidly obese people eat 50% more french fries than all other people.

316
00:16:26,464 --> 00:16:27,359
Rym: Think about that.

317
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:34,580
Rym: All in this junk food study, only french fries were correlated with morbid obesity.

318
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,700
Scott: Let's just eliminate french fries.

319
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:45,040
Rym: I think part of the problem is that if you get a burger and fries at a fancy place, like a Shnippers, you get a reasonable amount of fries.

320
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,598
Rym: Like I'll eat the whole burger and all the fries they give me.

321
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,760
Rym: But if you go to like McDonald's, they basically give you like enough fries to be an entire meal on their own.

322
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,312
Rym: That's like 1,000 calories in there.

323
00:16:54,332 --> 00:16:55,480
Rym: Maybe 2,000.

324
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:55,843
Scott: I don't know.

325
00:16:55,863 --> 00:16:57,960
Scott: I just don't eat crab.

326
00:17:03,842 --> 00:17:06,520
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

327
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:12,260
Rym: So, you know, we do that anime openers panel at cons and we show like Italian Sailor Moon.

328
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,351
Rym: Well, this is a video from Italy.

329
00:17:15,371 --> 00:17:16,980
Rym: It looks like it's an Italian boy band.

330
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:23,000
Rym: And they, their shtick, at least for this song, is Sailor Moon.

331
00:17:23,782 --> 00:17:28,240
Rym: They dress up like Sailor Moon, but kind of like crossed with the Sailor Starlights from Sailor Stars.

332
00:17:30,584 --> 00:17:32,040
Rym: Only you would know specifically.

333
00:17:33,961 --> 00:17:36,880
Rym: They perform the Sailor Moon opener in Italian.

334
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,931
Rym: As far as I'm concerned, this is canon.

335
00:17:40,494 --> 00:17:41,420
Rym: This is amazing.

336
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:42,141
Scott: Okay.

337
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:43,820
Scott: Why don't they do a whole episode?

338
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:50,339
Rym: I think they should just, I think all 200 episodes of Sailor Moon should just be performed as live musical theater by these guys.

339
00:17:50,965 --> 00:17:51,207
Scott: Okay.

340
00:17:51,894 --> 00:17:52,500
Scott: That's your thing of the day?

341
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,536
Rym: That's my thing of the day.

342
00:17:55,081 --> 00:17:58,540
Scott: Side note to that, there's a K-pop boy band, EXO.

343
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,880
Scott: They're like one of the most popular ones there is right now.

344
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,739
Scott: Maybe the most popular one there is right now amongst the Asian teenage girlies.

345
00:18:05,825 --> 00:18:06,620
Scott: Some of their songs are good.

346
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,860
Scott: They are doing a promotion right now with, I guess, Kuri and Disney.

347
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:12,720
Scott: It is a Star Wars promotion.

348
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,760
Scott: So it's like K-pop plus, the song is called Lightsaber.

349
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,544
Scott: There's a video.

350
00:18:17,705 --> 00:18:19,660
Scott: It doesn't have a lot of lightsabers in it, but it has a few.

351
00:18:19,884 --> 00:18:20,499
Rym: It's pretty good.

352
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,807
Scott: It's a thing that exists.

353
00:18:22,189 --> 00:18:23,579
Scott: that's just like, "Well, this

354
00:18:23,639 --> 00:18:23,760
Scott: exists.".

355
00:18:27,367 --> 00:18:27,609
Scott: All right.

356
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:28,539
Scott: So anyway, thing of the day.

357
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:35,580
Scott: You know Rod Serling, most people know him as the guy with the cool voice who talks at the beginning and end of your Twilight Zone episode.

358
00:18:36,143 --> 00:18:37,859
Scott: And don't really know anything else about him.

359
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,360
Rym: I knew he was a chain smoker.

360
00:18:40,122 --> 00:18:40,344
Scott: Yeah.

361
00:18:40,405 --> 00:18:41,639
Scott: Most people were in those days.

362
00:18:42,844 --> 00:18:43,999
Scott: That's how you get a voice like that.

363
00:18:46,402 --> 00:18:57,598
Scott: Anyway, here's an awesome video of him being interviewed on a news program talking about censorship, which is relevant because a lot of people these days are having trouble understanding what censorship is and what it isn't.

364
00:18:58,461 --> 00:19:02,097
Scott: And here's a person who knows exactly what it is telling you.

365
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:06,839
Scott: You know, why censorship is a problem, whose fault is it, etc.

366
00:19:07,587 --> 00:19:07,979
Rym: All right.

367
00:19:08,443 --> 00:19:09,799
Scott: It is relevant and also nerdy.

368
00:19:10,742 --> 00:19:12,300
Rym: In the moment, the booklet book was The Wheel of Time.

369
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:13,218
Rym: We're still reading it.

370
00:19:13,744 --> 00:19:15,260
Rym: I started up again past book four.

371
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:16,859
Rym: I'm almost done with book five.

372
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,819
Scott: Oh, I'm still way beginning with book five.

373
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:26,540
Rym: I am able to compartmentalize, so if we do a special show and talk about the first four, I can easily shut off the things I know from book five.

374
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,008
Scott: Yeah, I just stopped reading.

375
00:19:28,048 --> 00:19:29,275
Rym: I'm reading comics now.

376
00:19:29,295 --> 00:19:30,140
Scott: It's comic time.

377
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:34,691
Rym: Pretty much comes down to, "Whoa, you all just fucking know about Baelfire somehow.

378
00:19:34,712 --> 00:19:36,757
Rym: Yeah, don't stop it.

379
00:19:37,178 --> 00:19:37,539
Rym: Leave that

380
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:37,699
Rym: be.".

381
00:19:38,121 --> 00:19:39,211
Scott: I'm in comic land now.

382
00:19:39,231 --> 00:19:40,079
Scott: I'm not reading books now.

383
00:19:40,802 --> 00:19:54,040
Rym: The problem was I was going to go back into comic land, and I will because we're going to do a comic episode next week, but I kind of read just enough of book five of The Wheel of Time to get past the "remember what's going on" and into new things happening.

384
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,142
Scott: I just finished.

385
00:19:56,162 --> 00:20:01,720
Scott: I got into the new things happening with a little low gain action.

386
00:20:02,682 --> 00:20:05,420
Rym: I'm more into like Garth Byrne or Brine or that guy.

387
00:20:05,661 --> 00:20:06,519
Scott: Oh, he's hanging out?

388
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,114
Rym: Oh, he's...

389
00:20:07,944 --> 00:20:09,090
Scott: I think I actually got to him too.

390
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:11,060
Scott: He's got like a manor, right, out in the middle of nowhere?

391
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,740
Rym: And now he's going off following some people.

392
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:15,100
Scott: I think that's actually where I stopped reading was just about that part.

393
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:20,440
Rym: Oh, so he keeps going off doing things, and it's leading towards some things, I think.

394
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,916
Scott: I think it's Brine or Brine.

395
00:20:21,936 --> 00:20:22,180
Rym: I don't know.

396
00:20:23,464 --> 00:20:28,967
Rym: The only problem is... Ninuivinivinivine.

397
00:20:29,048 --> 00:20:30,800
Rym: I just do not want her to be in these books anymore.

398
00:20:31,703 --> 00:20:34,539
Rym: If I knew her in real life, I might stab her.

399
00:20:37,522 --> 00:20:40,160
Rym: Even Matt I can deal with compared to her, but I digress.

400
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:41,804
Rym: We have a Patreon.

401
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:45,500
Rym: If you wanted to vote on the episode we did tonight, you should have been giving us money.

402
00:20:47,803 --> 00:20:50,200
Scott: Or don't because that's a really bad use of your money.

403
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:55,740
Rym: All the suggestions we didn't do tonight, I'm going to keep in an ever-growing list for future votes.

404
00:20:56,681 --> 00:21:07,600
Rym: So you paid for the privilege of suggesting that we do a show on, for example, Pitch me your vision of utopia assuming I have unlimited funds to invest and want Rym to be our leader from Lara.

405
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,639
Scott: Wait, why is Rym the leader?

406
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:11,379
Rym: If you want to have input into this, Scott, pay some money.

407
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,940
Rym: Fun fact, Scott can't see what I do on the Patreon unless he pays.

408
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,560
Scott: Can't you add my account to be an owner of that?

409
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,364
Rym: I don't actually know.

410
00:21:20,309 --> 00:21:22,500
Rym: I learned Patreon just enough to get it going.

411
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,546
Scott: I made a free account.

412
00:21:23,566 --> 00:21:25,540
Scott: Just go into the settings and add me as an administrator.

413
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,306
Rym: I'll go look it all.

414
00:21:26,367 --> 00:21:27,419
Rym: I'll figure out how to do that stuff.

415
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,838
Scott: So then I can go and make fun of people.

416
00:21:29,506 --> 00:21:30,639
Rym: Who paid us money because they're dumb.

417
00:21:31,821 --> 00:21:34,759
Rym: So, somehow we didn't do an episode on Thanksgiving, which is...

418
00:21:35,061 --> 00:21:35,951
Scott: I can't believe we didn't.

419
00:21:35,972 --> 00:21:36,680
Scott: That makes no sense.

420
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,660
Rym: It's my favorite holiday.

421
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,214
Scott: Episode idea sent in by blank.

422
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,279
Rym: Yeah, it's the only blank one too.

423
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,750
Scott: Everyone else put who they were.

424
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:44,597
Scott: This person didn't.

425
00:21:45,581 --> 00:21:47,770
Scott: But yeah, that's a terrific episode idea.

426
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:50,460
Scott: We can do plenty of talking about that and we haven't done it yet somehow.

427
00:21:51,047 --> 00:21:51,580
Scott: And it's Thursday.

428
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,200
Rym: I have zero interest in the...

429
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,200
Scott: And Thanksgiving is also on a Thursday.

430
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,720
Rym: ...in the history of the holiday from a holiday perspective.

431
00:21:57,161 --> 00:22:04,020
Rym: As far as I'm concerned, it is the holiday of when you're a kid, your family cooks a giant dinner and you hang out at grandma's house.

432
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,600
Rym: When you're an adult.

433
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:11,760
Scott: I always wondered, I'm sure I could just research this, but it always felt like, did this thing they claim happened on Thanksgiving?

434
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:17,220
Scott: Where the white people and the Native Americans made some peace and had a meal together and it was a good time.

435
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,800
Scott: Like, first of all, did that happen?

436
00:22:22,403 --> 00:22:23,660
Scott: How frequently did it happen?

437
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:29,180
Scott: And why was this particular happening of it so significant and remembered to be a holiday for all time?

438
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:34,540
Scott: I get the feeling that Thanksgiving is really just kind of a racist holiday nowadays.

439
00:22:35,481 --> 00:22:36,970
Rym: Except that stuff doesn't come up at all.

440
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:38,540
Rym: No one talks about pilgrims anymore.

441
00:22:40,084 --> 00:22:42,473
Scott: Thanksgiving decorations really bother me a lot.

442
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:44,280
Scott: Especially the racist ones.

443
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:50,659
Scott: Why, you know, you should definitely complain about the Washington football team and especially the Cleveland baseball team.

444
00:22:51,211 --> 00:22:51,380
Scott: Yup.

445
00:22:51,521 --> 00:22:52,727
Scott: The Atlanta baseball team.

446
00:22:53,209 --> 00:22:54,435
Scott: But go after this holiday, too.

447
00:22:54,475 --> 00:22:55,440
Scott: I know some people are.

448
00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:01,540
Scott: But, you know, the Washington football team seems to be getting hit the hardest and I feel like they should all be hit equally hard.

449
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:05,480
Rym: The problem with the Redskins, because that's their name.

450
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,198
Scott: They all suck.

451
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:11,960
Rym: The problem with them is that they, it's not like, the Chicago Blackhawks are in the edge of that, too.

452
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,339
Rym: Like, that's not the best name.

453
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,020
Scott: No, yeah, put them on the list.

454
00:23:15,121 --> 00:23:16,440
Rym: But at least, so here's the difference.

455
00:23:17,661 --> 00:23:24,018
Rym: Not that I'm excusing the Blackhawks, but there's a degree of one, the Blackhawks aren't saying, "Our name is not offensive.

456
00:23:24,118 --> 00:23:24,359
Rym: Fuck

457
00:23:24,399 --> 00:23:24,539
Rym: you.".

458
00:23:24,981 --> 00:23:26,038
Rym: Like the Redskins are.

459
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,745
Rym: Two, Redskins, that's like blackface.

460
00:23:29,846 --> 00:23:38,620
Rym: Like, that is way different than Blackhawks, which was nominally named not after the tribe, but after a World War II regiment, I believe.

461
00:23:39,101 --> 00:23:42,028
Rym: Like, it's named after this military thing that themselves were in it.

462
00:23:42,048 --> 00:23:47,260
Rym: Like, there is a history that you could talk about there and they're staying out of this argument.

463
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:51,340
Rym: Not like the Redskins that are trying to convince people that as far as they're concerned.

464
00:23:52,004 --> 00:23:53,760
Scott: Weren't the Blackhawks formed before World War II?

465
00:23:54,663 --> 00:23:55,329
Rym: I don't actually know.

466
00:23:55,349 --> 00:23:56,096
Scott: The full story.

467
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,700
Scott: Their original six team, I believe.

468
00:23:58,126 --> 00:23:58,360
Scott: Yeah.

469
00:23:58,581 --> 00:23:59,960
Scott: And that's before World War II.

470
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,712
Rym: Maybe it was World War I. I don't remember.

471
00:24:01,752 --> 00:24:02,920
Rym: I just remember trying to research that.

472
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:10,020
Rym: I was looking up the information to argue something about how the Redskins deserve the extra criticism they're getting.

473
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:10,943
Scott: The original six, right?

474
00:24:10,963 --> 00:24:13,071
Rym: Canadian, Leaf, Ranger, Bruin, Blackhawk.

475
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,560
Rym: Hawks, Haki, T. I'm going to look up right now the origin of the Blackhawks name again.

476
00:24:22,885 --> 00:24:23,058
Rym: Okay.

477
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,579
Rym: Because 1926, World War I.

478
00:24:26,921 --> 00:24:27,387
Scott: One, okay.

479
00:24:27,448 --> 00:24:28,239
Scott: You said World War II.

480
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:28,619
Scott: I did.

481
00:24:28,781 --> 00:24:29,140
Rym: I was right.

482
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:32,600
Rym: It was World War I. You were right and I was right, but I said the wrong World War.

483
00:24:32,782 --> 00:24:33,209
Scott: That's okay.

484
00:24:33,311 --> 00:24:33,718
Scott: That's fine.

485
00:24:36,281 --> 00:24:41,020
Rym: There's a difference between being called the Blackhawks because of this history versus being called-.

486
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,240
Scott: I knew that World War II happened after hockey was invented.

487
00:24:46,381 --> 00:24:54,800
Rym: But yeah, all that aside, as far as I'm concerned, it is either the hang out with your family and have food holiday or the hang out with your family and friends and have food holiday.

488
00:24:55,201 --> 00:24:55,840
Scott: Also football.

489
00:24:56,526 --> 00:24:57,040
Rym: Also football.

490
00:24:57,764 --> 00:24:58,118
Rym: No, no.

491
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:06,680
Rym: Also, the Lions play the only game I watch every year with them in it and I root for them and then they lose.

492
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,680
Scott: How many times have the Lions won on Thanksgiving?

493
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,980
Rym: I don't actually know what the stats are, to be honest.

494
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:12,660
Rym: It's more than one.

495
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:18,420
Rym: I remember the times they were up before halftime and lost by the end of the game.

496
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,339
Scott: You know, they suck this year, so they're probably going to lose again.

497
00:25:20,888 --> 00:25:21,018
Scott: Yup.

498
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,198
Scott: I don't know who they're playing this year, though.

499
00:25:22,662 --> 00:25:26,460
Rym: But I'm very happy that somehow the Lions have kept the tradition of that's their game.

500
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:33,160
Rym: That is a Thanksgiving tradition and they do the stupid thing where the turkey comes out and it has N turkey legs.

501
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:36,137
Scott: I haven't seen that on TV, actually.

502
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:45,619
Rym: Yeah, but I'm assuming it's still a thing because usually when halftime happens, I wander and eat a whole bunch of food from the table that has the potato chips and the sour cream dip.

503
00:25:46,471 --> 00:25:46,657
Scott: M&M's.

504
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,152
Rym: Yup.

505
00:25:49,242 --> 00:25:50,910
Rym: Should we talk about Thanksgiving food?

506
00:25:50,971 --> 00:25:52,680
Rym: Because I feel like we're in the food direction.

507
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,110
Scott: Well, people wanted food shows, right?

508
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:56,540
Scott: So Thanksgiving, you gotta make the turkey.

509
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,013
Rym: Yup.

510
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,809
Scott: You eat dark meat if you're a human being.

511
00:25:58,829 --> 00:26:00,500
Scott: You eat white meat if you're not a human being.

512
00:26:00,802 --> 00:26:02,820
Rym: I actually do like both on Thanksgiving.

513
00:26:03,764 --> 00:26:05,219
Scott: I don't like white meat pretty much ever.

514
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,438
Rym: So you eat a bunch of dark meat.

515
00:26:07,521 --> 00:26:08,739
Scott: Dark meat has deliciousness in it.

516
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,113
Rym: But you take white meat and you put gravy on it.

517
00:26:11,133 --> 00:26:12,400
Rym: You don't put gravy on the dark meat.

518
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:15,680
Scott: How about you just don't eat white meat or the gravy because gravy is gross.

519
00:26:15,942 --> 00:26:16,690
Rym: Gravy is delicious.

520
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:17,660
Rym: The fuck is wrong with you?

521
00:26:17,921 --> 00:26:18,152
Scott: Not really.

522
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,022
Rym: Gravy?

523
00:26:19,062 --> 00:26:21,178
Rym: The only thing better than gravy on turkey...

524
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:21,943
Scott: And you know what?

525
00:26:21,963 --> 00:26:24,520
Scott: Gravy does taste, you know, it's not as bad as white meat.

526
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,579
Scott: Well, I put the gravy on the dark meat.

527
00:26:27,844 --> 00:26:28,640
Rym: You wouldn't play God.

528
00:26:29,344 --> 00:26:30,138
Rym: You wouldn't play God.

529
00:26:30,804 --> 00:26:31,439
Scott: What's wrong with that?

530
00:26:33,241 --> 00:26:34,035
Rym: But I'm gonna...

531
00:26:34,643 --> 00:26:36,020
Scott: Also, I usually just eat the drumstick.

532
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:44,860
Rym: So we have a lot of traditions, like in the FRC, we'll actually do several around Thanksgiving, Thanksgivings that are just... We cook a full family Thanksgiving dinner.

533
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:47,380
Scott: Thanksgiving is pretty much the number one holiday, at least in the U.S.

534
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:47,641
Scott: I'm sure.

535
00:26:47,661 --> 00:26:55,300
Scott: in other countries they don't have Thanksgiving, obviously, but they have other equivalent holidays that are basically the same goddamn thing with a different culture.

536
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,400
Rym: Well, actually the tradition goes back to England.

537
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:03,700
Scott: Some sort of harvest festival of autumn time, somewhere between September and December.

538
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:07,940
Scott: And you have lots of delicious food and your family gets together.

539
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,039
Rym: College millennial types.

540
00:27:10,461 --> 00:27:16,100
Rym: We started doing this pretty early, but then it's obvious that a lot of people our age do the same thing.

541
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:20,257
Rym: People may or may not go home or do a family thing when you're in your 20s or 30s.

542
00:27:21,161 --> 00:27:25,260
Rym: It's rare that the 20 or 30 year old is the host for their own family.

543
00:27:25,781 --> 00:27:28,597
Rym: Usually you go home to mom or grandma or something like that.

544
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:36,740
Rym: But us and a lot of our friends will have alternate Thanksgivings around Thanksgiving just for their friends, but they cook the same family spread.

545
00:27:36,941 --> 00:27:43,120
Scott: That would bring the leftovers from the previous, you know, you go on Black Friday, you hook up with everybody, maybe it's Black Saturday.

546
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:47,500
Scott: Everybody shows up, brings the leftovers from real Thanksgiving Thursday.

547
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:51,233
Scott: But remember last year we did- You're gonna feast, why not feast four or five times?

548
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:52,520
Scott: You got these four days off work.

549
00:27:52,900 --> 00:28:01,120
Rym: Yeah, but I can't cook a whole turkey because even if I get like all our friends in New York together, a real turkey is still too much turkey.

550
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:09,406
Scott: You can get a little turkey, but it's still, it's just too much- You got to pre-order turkeys.

551
00:28:09,426 --> 00:28:13,600
Scott: Usually those old ladies at the grocery store, you know how they do, they get the free turkey.

552
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:20,659
Scott: They buy all this stuff and they get points or whatever and they somehow get the free turkey, what the grocery store does.

553
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:21,040
Scott: I don't know.

554
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,156
Rym: I got the Wegmans free turkey one year at RIT.

555
00:28:24,182 --> 00:28:24,400
Rym: Okay.

556
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,280
Rym: Yeah, I took it home with me in an icebox and took it to Michigan.

557
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,000
Rym: But anyway, when we do the feast, we don't do a turkey.

558
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:36,059
Rym: What we usually do is either I'll make like four or five Cornish hens.

559
00:28:36,443 --> 00:28:37,619
Scott: Some other bird, a ducks.

560
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:38,681
Rym: Yup, ducks.

561
00:28:38,902 --> 00:28:40,467
Rym: Last year I did that crispy duck.

562
00:28:40,647 --> 00:28:44,580
Rym: That was actually, I was real, a little spicy maybe, but I was a fan of that duck.

563
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,568
Scott: Yeah, there's a lot of people that take it too far.

564
00:28:46,588 --> 00:28:49,080
Scott: Like the whole turducken thing, I think that's just like, it's just too much.

565
00:28:49,481 --> 00:28:50,059
Rym: It's excessive.

566
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,820
Scott: It's just, it's like, that's like eating all the french fries at Conifado.

567
00:28:53,081 --> 00:28:54,317
Rym: It's like the bacon worship thing.

568
00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:00,917
Scott: It's like, yeah, everyone loves a feast, but you know, extreme food like that is supposed to be a joke.

569
00:29:00,937 --> 00:29:02,020
Scott: It's not supposed to be for real.

570
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:07,137
Rym: Yeah, instead of doing the turducken, have like an ice Cornish hen, but you know, the turkey, you could cook that turkey any day.

571
00:29:07,197 --> 00:29:08,000
Rym: The turkey's not the point.

572
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,727
Rym: The point is the sides.

573
00:29:09,767 --> 00:29:12,960
Rym: You don't make real stuffing just all the time for dinner.

574
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,020
Scott: Yeah, it's a pain in the ass.

575
00:29:14,301 --> 00:29:15,733
Rym: Yeah, and don't eat stove top.

576
00:29:15,773 --> 00:29:16,560
Rym: That shit's poison.

577
00:29:17,225 --> 00:29:17,919
Scott: But it tastes so good.

578
00:29:18,161 --> 00:29:18,852
Rym: No, it's poison.

579
00:29:18,892 --> 00:29:19,278
Rym: Don't eat it.

580
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,100
Rym: We ate it so much though, and it was good.

581
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:21,640
Rym: We did, and you know what?

582
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,039
Scott: If I made some right now, you'd eat it.

583
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,885
Rym: Yeah, it's like when you walk by McDonald's.

584
00:29:24,925 --> 00:29:30,200
Rym: As much as I know that McDonald's is garbage poison, there's an animal part of my brain that says, "Yo, dog.

585
00:29:30,684 --> 00:29:32,218
Rym: That is so much oil and

586
00:29:32,238 --> 00:29:32,440
Rym: protein.".

587
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:35,259
Scott: I'm going to make some stove top, and you're going to get home, and it's going to be ready.

588
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,243
Rym: Yeah, and you know what?

589
00:29:36,283 --> 00:29:41,180
Rym: I'll salivate in a Pavlonian fashion, and then I'll knock it on the ground and refuse to eat it because it's dangerous.

590
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:41,877
Scott: I think you'll eat it.

591
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:42,792
Rym: No, I can't.

592
00:29:43,583 --> 00:29:43,975
Scott: I'll eat it.

593
00:29:45,051 --> 00:29:45,199
Scott: Plus...

594
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,813
Rym: Maybe I'll buy some on the way home right now.

595
00:29:46,833 --> 00:29:47,680
Scott: I haven't eaten it in years.

596
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,035
Rym: Well, you're going to melt your stick of margarine into it.

597
00:29:50,055 --> 00:29:50,820
Rym: You can't use butter.

598
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:51,882
Rym: Oh.

599
00:29:52,522 --> 00:29:53,317
Rym: Also, don't burn it.

600
00:29:54,541 --> 00:29:54,902
Scott: It's all right.

601
00:29:54,922 --> 00:29:56,586
Scott: I'm going to make stove top.

602
00:29:56,987 --> 00:30:01,720
Scott: I'm going to buy some tonight, and that'll be the first time I had stove top in many years, and it'll be delicious.

603
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,507
Rym: Yeah, I can live stream eating the stove top.

604
00:30:03,608 --> 00:30:05,396
Rym: Oh, I can taste it in my mouth now.

605
00:30:05,597 --> 00:30:06,119
Rym: Oh, my God.

606
00:30:06,903 --> 00:30:08,299
Scott: It's wet buttered bread.

607
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:13,496
Rym: The thing is, as much as stove top will trick me, Scott, it's the season for real stuffing.

608
00:30:13,516 --> 00:30:14,279
Rym: When we do our feast...

609
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,300
Scott: Real stuffing is way better than stove top.

610
00:30:17,784 --> 00:30:23,259
Rym: I almost want someone else to cook the bird this year so I can cook the stuffing because, honestly, fun...

611
00:30:23,841 --> 00:30:25,999
Scott: You don't actually make the stuffing in the bird because that's stupid.

612
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,984
Rym: Yeah, there's a time and place for the stuffing in the bird.

613
00:30:29,384 --> 00:30:40,380
Rym: The time and the place for that is grandma is making a gigantic turkey for your entire extended family, and grandma is going to put up with the old style of cooking a turkey for an entire day.

614
00:30:41,981 --> 00:30:43,650
Rym: I'm not going to cook a turkey for 12 hours.

615
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:45,419
Rym: I'm going to cook a turkey for three hours.

616
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:49,008
Rym: So don't even try to make stuffing in a bird.

617
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:52,920
Rym: In fact, even when I made the stuffing in the Cornish hen, it was good, but it wasn't enough.

618
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,334
Rym: So, do you want to make the bird this year?

619
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:56,394
Rym: No.

620
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:02,814
Rym: Friends, who wants to make the bird for the New York feast, missus?

621
00:31:02,834 --> 00:31:04,280
Rym: Because I kind of don't want to make the bird.

622
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,112
Rym: Maybe we should do one in Albany and get them to make the bird.

623
00:31:07,133 --> 00:31:07,959
Rym: Get Pete to make the bird.

624
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,809
Scott: You can just pay someone to deliver one.

625
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:11,640
Rym: Yeah, that feels...

626
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,031
Scott: Boston chicken?

627
00:31:13,132 --> 00:31:13,679
Rym: No, no, no, no.

628
00:31:14,544 --> 00:31:15,649
Rym: I'm done with that nonsense.

629
00:31:16,152 --> 00:31:17,720
Scott: Oh, sorry, they changed the name to Boston Market.

630
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:23,080
Rym: So what is the best side in Thanksgiving food?

631
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,360
Scott: Depends on whose house you go to.

632
00:31:25,081 --> 00:31:31,100
Rym: In general, assuming they're all of equal grandma quality, what's the tops, other than stuffing?

633
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,064
Scott: I mean, everything is so equally good, right?

634
00:31:33,104 --> 00:31:36,132
Scott: So I guess you got to start somewhere.

635
00:31:36,473 --> 00:31:39,500
Scott: You got to start with the sweet potato, but not just any sweet potato.

636
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:45,480
Scott: The special extra candied sweet potato with perhaps honey, brown sugar, just sugar.

637
00:31:46,702 --> 00:31:50,200
Scott: The candied yam or whatever you want to call it, you know, delicious sweet potato.

638
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:57,180
Rym: Yum, sweet potato, even just like squashes all cooked in that way where they're basically just a vehicle for honey and molasses and sugar.

639
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,223
Scott: Oh, yeah.

640
00:31:59,304 --> 00:32:00,087
Scott: What else is delicious?

641
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:02,960
Scott: Maybe you got someone who makes a meatball?

642
00:32:04,502 --> 00:32:09,579
Rym: I feel like the meatball, like the sweet meatball and the lo mein are a very...

643
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:10,207
Scott: Lo mein?

644
00:32:10,514 --> 00:32:10,698
Rym: Yeah.

645
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,560
Scott: I've never seen lo mein on Thanksgiving.

646
00:32:12,941 --> 00:32:14,680
Rym: I've seen many lo mein on Thanksgiving.

647
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,159
Scott: Whoa, I've never seen that.

648
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,360
Rym: It's basically just like Thanksgiving themed lo mein.

649
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,300
Scott: I've never seen that in my life.

650
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,420
Rym: It's a pretty common thing.

651
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,807
Scott: You know what, I will say the cranberry sauce, overrated.

652
00:32:24,469 --> 00:32:27,960
Scott: It's a tradition, but usually someone buys a can of it, dumps it out, and no one eats it.

653
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,229
Rym: Look at that shit, it's disgusting.

654
00:32:29,269 --> 00:32:30,680
Rym: It's still in the shape of the can.

655
00:32:31,705 --> 00:32:35,040
Scott: Even if someone makes the fresh cranberry sauce, it's like, all right.

656
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,001
Rym: Well, here's what I've noticed.

657
00:32:36,582 --> 00:32:48,700
Rym: In the Midwest and among heathens and Philsteins, what I see people do is they'll have the gelatinized cranberry sauce or the cranberry goop, and they slice it up and they eat it like it's its own thing.

658
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,762
Rym: That's not how you do it.

659
00:32:49,803 --> 00:32:50,524
Rym: You know what you do?

660
00:32:50,765 --> 00:32:56,280
Rym: You're supposed to put that on the white meat next to the gravy and have sort of like a moulange.

661
00:32:56,521 --> 00:32:58,891
Scott: That's why I don't eat, first of all, don't eat the white meat.

662
00:32:59,052 --> 00:33:00,800
Scott: Second of all, don't eat the cranberry sauce.

663
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:05,180
Rym: The cranberry sauce is an accent to the other sides or perhaps the main dish.

664
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,090
Scott: Just don't do any of that.

665
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:06,738
Scott: That's all bad.

666
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,713
Rym: Stuffing we've talked about, but...

667
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,220
Scott: Stuffing is way up there as well.

668
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,700
Rym: I like stuffings that have sweet, like golden raisins or cranberries or things like that.

669
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:18,340
Scott: I like any kind of stuffing as long as it is hot, wet breads of deliciousness.

670
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,260
Rym: The best stuffing in my opinion...

671
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,080
Scott: You can put in celeries, you can put in all kinds of stuff.

672
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:29,580
Rym: It is mostly celery and onion and really, really savory with a bunch of fucking cayenne pepper just like mashed in.

673
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:33,980
Scott: Whatever you put in that stuffing, you really can't ruin it as long as you forgot the wet bread.

674
00:33:34,742 --> 00:33:37,340
Rym: I'm a big fan of the mashed potato filled with gravy.

675
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:43,260
Scott: You know, I do like a mashed potato, but I don't like it on Thanksgiving because it interferes with my yam of candy.

676
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:44,822
Rym: You know what though?

677
00:33:44,882 --> 00:33:49,280
Rym: It can serve to protect the yam from other relatives or friends.

678
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:55,300
Rym: When I was a kid, my little brother would eat basically a milk jug's worth of mashed potatoes.

679
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:00,780
Rym: And I feel like that was the sacrificial dish that prevented him from eating all the stuffings so I could eat the stuffing.

680
00:34:03,261 --> 00:34:05,638
Scott: You eat sacrificial dishes on the table like a veggie mix?

681
00:34:07,227 --> 00:34:07,920
Rym: I feel like so...

682
00:34:08,061 --> 00:34:09,960
Scott: A little asparagus to get someone distracted.

683
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,679
Rym: Every Thanksgiving, there's the big salad bowl with the salad.

684
00:34:14,141 --> 00:34:22,780
Rym: I feel like most people take just enough salad to be polite and really the salad's just like everyone lying to themselves.

685
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,518
Rym: Just don't bother with the salad on Thanksgiving again.

686
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:26,351
Scott: But I do the salad.

687
00:34:26,371 --> 00:34:26,880
Scott: I want salad.

688
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:27,637
Rym: You're the only one.

689
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:31,940
Scott: Like I scoop a nice big bowl of salad to eat before eating all the other good stuff.

690
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:35,880
Rym: Yeah, I feel like I should just eat all the other nonsense foods on that day.

691
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:41,560
Scott: But I mean, you're making the same amount of food no matter what, so anything you don't eat today is just going to be a leftover tomorrow.

692
00:34:42,022 --> 00:34:45,440
Rym: True, but the salad is the most leftover thing and it doesn't keep that line.

693
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,978
Scott: Great, so I can eat some salad tomorrow too.

694
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,100
Rym: Yeah, but salad by the third day is not great.

695
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:57,739
Scott: I'm not eating salad on the third day, but I'm still going to have a candied yam on the third day because I ate salad and I didn't eat ten times as many yams on day one and two.

696
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:04,840
Rym: A oft overlooked is you've got to have the biscuits or the rolls, the dinner rolls.

697
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,000
Scott: You need some kind of bread.

698
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,169
Rym: No, it can't just be bread.

699
00:35:07,209 --> 00:35:08,300
Rym: I'm going to take a hard line.

700
00:35:08,561 --> 00:35:11,676
Rym: People who have the toast or just bread or like garlic bread.

701
00:35:11,736 --> 00:35:12,479
Rym: No, it's got to be.

702
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:13,278
Scott: No, garlic bread, what?

703
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:18,580
Rym: It's got to be dinner rolls, like the kinds that have the little crack in the top and you crack it open.

704
00:35:19,461 --> 00:35:21,379
Scott: Any kind of nice breads will do.

705
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,360
Rym: I think roll is required.

706
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,276
Scott: I mean, you could make like the kind of bread I just made.

707
00:35:26,296 --> 00:35:26,840
Scott: That'd be fine.

708
00:35:27,841 --> 00:35:32,240
Rym: I feel like that serves a different purpose because that's not going to come out hot and you're not going to get an individual.

709
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,160
Scott: You can heat up bread without toasting it.

710
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:34,948
Rym: No, it's not the same thing.

711
00:35:34,988 --> 00:35:36,059
Rym: It's not steamy inside.

712
00:35:36,483 --> 00:35:38,500
Scott: You can also get bread that was just baked.

713
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:48,880
Rym: I feel like most people, the problem is dinner rolls get a short shrift because in the old days, like my grandma and every grandma I knew, they didn't have a microwave or if they did, it was a separate appliance.

714
00:35:49,341 --> 00:35:53,920
Rym: And in the kitchen, they had a stove on the bottom that they cooked the turkey and the stuffing and everything in.

715
00:35:54,441 --> 00:35:57,739
Rym: And they had the stove on the top that they cooked all the rolls in.

716
00:35:58,541 --> 00:36:00,480
Rym: Most people do not have two ovens anymore.

717
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,359
Scott: I see a lot of people, they've got two ovens.

718
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:05,560
Scott: They got, you know, the regular oven and they got one like built into the wall somewhere.

719
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,831
Rym: Yeah, most people, that's a microwave.

720
00:36:08,152 --> 00:36:09,599
Rym: The second oven is kind of rare.

721
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,059
Scott: Microwave is usually above the stove.

722
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,700
Scott: I'm talking about an oven like in a wall separate.

723
00:36:14,861 --> 00:36:14,921
Scott: Who?

724
00:36:14,961 --> 00:36:16,980
Rym: Name someone who has that as a second oven.

725
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,459
Scott: My friends, the Cohens.

726
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:18,897
Scott: Okay.

727
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,339
Scott: I know at least one grandma who has it.

728
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,120
Rym: Yeah, you're naming grandmas and like older relatives.

729
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,479
Scott: There's plenty of people who got two ovens.

730
00:36:25,402 --> 00:36:27,720
Scott: All kinds of kosher Jews, they got two everything.

731
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,189
Rym: Okay, yeah, kosher Jews.

732
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,239
Rym: So you've got the exception then.

733
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:34,920
Rym: Normal people do not have two ovens even though they should instead of a microwave.

734
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,208
Scott: Even though one's dairy and one's meat.

735
00:36:36,248 --> 00:36:38,000
Scott: You could put a bread in the dairy one, no problem.

736
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,900
Scott: As Jen and I'm Passover, you just set it on fire.

737
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:45,520
Rym: Like if I had my druthers, I would get rid of our microwave and put a second convection oven up there just for making bread and rolls.

738
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,380
Scott: A convection oven is not a regular oven.

739
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,780
Rym: Yeah, but you can make a fucking roll in there just fine.

740
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:54,294
Scott: And a microwave is needed for things even though it is rarely used.

741
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:01,580
Rym: Most people reheat leftovers in the microwave and that is the worst way to do most leftovers.

742
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:07,219
Scott: Most leftovers, that is true, they come out worse in the microwave but sometimes, just ain't got time for that shit.

743
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,369
Rym: You know what, just wait, it's worth it.

744
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:11,200
Rym: It only takes like 10 minutes to preheat the oven.

745
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,818
Scott: I'm hungry right this second.

746
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,920
Scott: Microwave, and there's certain things that you can't eat at all without the microwave.

747
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,479
Rym: Just don't eat those things.

748
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,320
Scott: But they're delicious.

749
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,180
Rym: Like most Thanksgiving leftovers, you can have some turkey.

750
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:29,619
Scott: I actually only use my microwave for like one thing which is those plastic bags with Indian food in them.

751
00:37:30,222 --> 00:37:36,139
Scott: And you make a rice in the rice cooker and you put the plastic bag in the microwave after cutting a little slit in it and then you dump the hot...

752
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,040
Rym: Or you just dump the plastic bag in boiling water.

753
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:39,780
Scott: I don't like that method.

754
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,184
Rym: Why?

755
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,220
Rym: That works just as well.

756
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:41,939
Scott: It's a pain in the ass.

757
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:42,679
Rym: No it's not.

758
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:43,918
Scott: It's a pain in the ass.

759
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:51,680
Rym: But, I mean, like reheating leftovers, Thanksgiving leftovers, the best way to do it, set your oven to like 390/400.

760
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:59,665
Rym: Put all the leftovers like mashed into some thin tin foil and just throw it in the oven for like 5 minutes, maybe 10.

761
00:37:59,665 --> 00:38:02,320
Rym: I can't think of a better way to reheat almost any Thanksgiving leftover.

762
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:06,060
Scott: The oven does preheat better than the microwave which makes everything mushy and bleh.

763
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:06,569
Rym: Yup.

764
00:38:07,921 --> 00:38:08,940
Rym: Oh, what other sides?

765
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,120
Rym: We're not even talking about desserts yet.

766
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:11,707
Scott: What about Thanksgiving?

767
00:38:11,728 --> 00:38:12,700
Scott: things that aren't food related?

768
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,226
Rym: Like what?

769
00:38:13,246 --> 00:38:14,340
Rym: You can hang out with your family.

770
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:17,115
Scott: Did anything ever happen onto Thanksgiving?

771
00:38:17,356 --> 00:38:18,060
Scott: that was weird?

772
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,640
Scott: That was different from any other Thanksgiving?

773
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:20,399
Scott: For me, no.

774
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:26,320
Rym: I've never had the like racist uncle starts talking about how the Jews are stealing his money.

775
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,820
Rym: Like that never happens in my family.

776
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:31,680
Scott: That doesn't happen in my family either because anyone who's like that is just not invited.

777
00:38:31,841 --> 00:38:33,240
Rym: Yeah, they're the other side of the family.

778
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,319
Scott: I don't understand this.

779
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,944
Scott: It's like people have someone in their family.

780
00:38:36,004 --> 00:38:42,980
Scott: that's shitty and they feel some sort of obligation just because you share genetics with this person that you have to be with them on this holiday.

781
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,857
Rym: Yeah, your racist uncle, unfriend him on Facebook.

782
00:38:45,897 --> 00:38:46,400
Rym: It's okay.

783
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:55,680
Scott: Yeah, it's like just because someone shares genetics relations with you, like they're a bad person, you know, maybe you have a really big family, just don't associate with them.

784
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,447
Scott: You're under no obligation whatsoever to do that.

785
00:38:58,708 --> 00:38:59,811
Scott: Don't invite them to your house.

786
00:38:59,871 --> 00:39:01,375
Scott: If they invite you, don't go to their house.

787
00:39:01,395 --> 00:39:02,077
Scott: Don't talk to them.

788
00:39:02,157 --> 00:39:02,940
Scott: Don't be friends with them.

789
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:04,326
Scott: And don't do anything with them.

790
00:39:04,346 --> 00:39:06,219
Scott: They say, "Hey, how come you stopped talking to

791
00:39:06,259 --> 00:39:06,300
Scott: me?".

792
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,385
Scott: And you say, "Because you're a crazy racist old uncle.

793
00:39:08,405 --> 00:39:09,147
Scott: Go fuck yourself.

794
00:39:10,009 --> 00:39:12,274
Scott: I don't want to talk to you because you're a horrible racist human being.

795
00:39:12,294 --> 00:39:13,016
Scott: You're not my friend.

796
00:39:13,036 --> 00:39:14,760
Scott: You're not anyone I want to be related to in any

797
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:14,840
Scott: way.".

798
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,414
Rym: See, it's interesting that that is like the meat.

799
00:39:16,455 --> 00:39:17,040
Rym: Like that is a big meat.

800
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:17,904
Scott: It's that simple.

801
00:39:17,964 --> 00:39:18,647
Scott: Problem solved.

802
00:39:18,667 --> 00:39:21,759
Scott: And then when you hang out at your family gathering, sure, there's less people there.

803
00:39:22,282 --> 00:39:25,740
Scott: But you're all having a good time because it's only good people that you actually care about.

804
00:39:26,521 --> 00:39:30,640
Scott: And you don't have to give any of your delicious candied yams to some racist assholes.

805
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:33,608
Rym: I'm just amazed at the meme I see on a regular basis everywhere.

806
00:39:33,648 --> 00:39:37,720
Rym: People talking about how going home for Thanksgiving is the worst because of racist Uncle Joe.

807
00:39:38,762 --> 00:39:42,680
Rym: And you know how he's wearing his Trump hat at the table just waiting for anyone to say anything.

808
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:53,200
Rym: And like the Johnsons didn't want to invite him, but the Johnson Johnson's invited him anyway and they didn't tell him so he shows up.

809
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,377
Scott: If he shows up, don't let him in.

810
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:55,810
Rym: But half the people want him there.

811
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:56,840
Rym: No one wants to create a scene.

812
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,389
Scott: Anyone who doesn't, if he tries to create a scene, call the cops.

813
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:02,940
Scott: You just sit inside watching football while the cops arrest his ass.

814
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:06,296
Scott: And if anyone says no, they want him to be here, they're racist too.

815
00:40:06,316 --> 00:40:06,980
Scott: Why are you letting them in?

816
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:10,960
Rym: I just get the impression most people's families are way more drama filled than all our families.

817
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:12,188
Scott: Yeah, you know why they're drama filled?

818
00:40:12,208 --> 00:40:13,799
Rym: Because they let the uncle in.

819
00:40:14,921 --> 00:40:17,428
Scott: If you don't let him in in the first place, you don't have this problem.

820
00:40:17,449 --> 00:40:21,220
Scott: You had to start, they already made the mistake of this person's been to Thanksgiving so many times.

821
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:24,011
Scott: In my family, that person was never allowed at Thanksgiving.

822
00:40:24,192 --> 00:40:25,056
Scott: We never see them.

823
00:40:25,276 --> 00:40:26,140
Scott: They're gone, baby.

824
00:40:26,661 --> 00:40:28,532
Scott: I don't even think they're out there.

825
00:40:28,653 --> 00:40:29,297
Scott: They probably died.

826
00:40:29,317 --> 00:40:29,720
Scott: Who knows?

827
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:38,140
Scott: And because we cut that shit off early, like before I was even born, before I even understood this policy was intact, we've been protected from it ever since.

828
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:40,652
Scott: I didn't have to start this up suddenly.

829
00:40:40,672 --> 00:40:42,220
Scott: I had it right from the beginning.

830
00:40:44,062 --> 00:40:47,180
Rym: It's interesting how it's such a common theme around the holidays.

831
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:53,180
Rym: The arguments at Thanksgiving and then the drama and depression around Christmas go hand in hand, it seems.

832
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:58,040
Scott: Just because someone is related to you doesn't mean they have to be a part of your life.

833
00:40:58,961 --> 00:41:04,400
Scott: Sure, you can make them if you want to, and it's perfectly fine, but there's no obligation to do that.

834
00:41:04,801 --> 00:41:08,440
Scott: Just because there's some DNA in common, that means nothing in society.

835
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:48,754
Rym: What does amaze me is a lot of people also talk about how Thanksgiving... It's interesting, you see this split between people who show up to Gennaro family Thanksgiving dinner and don't know the reality of the real world or what's up, and then there's this whole other set, because I was reading a FARC thread about Thanksgiving today, and there's a bunch of people talking about how when they were kids, Aunt Mildred would always offer to go to the store, and they thought that was weird because she's missing out on football and family, and now they're older, they're coming back from college, and they realize Aunt Mildred way into marijuana, and suddenly they're good friends with Aunt Mildred because they come back home, and they're like,

836
00:41:48,774 --> 00:41:49,095
Rym: "Whoa!".

837
00:41:51,182 --> 00:42:05,440
Rym: Thanksgiving seems like the holiday where people who were kids and went off to college come back home and have their first adult interactions as adults and seeing adult members of their not immediate family as adults.

838
00:42:06,461 --> 00:42:09,227
Rym: You have the conversations with your uncle who's not racist.

839
00:42:09,728 --> 00:42:14,800
Rym: that just couldn't happen when it was still a child versus uncle relationship.

840
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,460
Scott: Yeah, well, kid Thanksgiving is totally different from adult Thanksgiving.

841
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:19,159
Rym: Yeah, kid Thanksgiving is the kids' table.

842
00:42:20,703 --> 00:42:24,880
Scott: Right, and even if you're a football fan as a kid, are you really watching and understanding?

843
00:42:25,341 --> 00:42:26,020
Rym: Some kids are.

844
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,060
Scott: You're probably playing Nintendo while someone else is watching football, right?

845
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:29,125
Scott: Yep.

846
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:32,300
Scott: You're playing Nintendo, you eat a delicious food, you play Nintendo, you go home.

847
00:42:32,563 --> 00:42:32,778
Scott: Yep.

848
00:42:33,002 --> 00:42:33,719
Scott: Say hi to grandma.

849
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:38,660
Rym: I remember one thing that I remember very specifically is I was always really excited to go to any grandma's house.

850
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,120
Rym: That was just always great times.

851
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:40,432
Rym: Oh, yeah.

852
00:42:40,741 --> 00:42:43,640
Rym: But I remember mom is always bored.

853
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,092
Rym: Mom's kind of going like, "Uh-huh,

854
00:42:45,394 --> 00:42:45,717
Rym: uh-huh.".

855
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,719
Rym: Well, mom's mom is talking about what moms talk about.

856
00:42:49,861 --> 00:42:56,300
Rym: And dad's watching TV, like football, talking to uncle and grandpa and all those people.

857
00:42:56,701 --> 00:42:58,979
Rym: And they're all also kind of bored and just sort of chit-chatting.

858
00:42:59,781 --> 00:43:03,700
Rym: And kid wants to stay forever because, yay, grandma's house.

859
00:43:04,502 --> 00:43:05,978
Rym: Everyone else wants to go home.

860
00:43:08,164 --> 00:43:09,520
Scott: Well, there's always that division, right?

861
00:43:11,504 --> 00:43:14,800
Scott: Historically, it's like a gendered division, but in my family, not really.

862
00:43:15,461 --> 00:43:18,940
Rym: Yeah, when I hang out with your family at Thanksgiving, I actually spend a lot of my time in the kitchen.

863
00:43:19,421 --> 00:43:22,640
Scott: There's a kitchen crew and there's a living room crew, right?

864
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:27,060
Scott: You're either watching football or you're involved with food and kitchen action.

865
00:43:27,742 --> 00:43:29,620
Scott: And there's a lot of going back and forth.

866
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:31,180
Rym: The third crew is Nintendo.

867
00:43:32,081 --> 00:43:33,119
Rym: Kids, if there are kids.

868
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:34,140
Scott: Yeah, but there's no kids anymore.

869
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:35,518
Scott: But maybe your family has some.

870
00:43:36,562 --> 00:43:39,940
Scott: But yeah, there's like these two or three crews that occur.

871
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:44,500
Scott: And people might transfer between them at various times, right?

872
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:47,719
Scott: But, you know, that's sort of like how it always goes down.

873
00:43:48,681 --> 00:43:57,019
Scott: I wonder if like other countries that the other, not Thanksgiving, but similar to Thanksgiving harvest type holidays, it sort of plays out the same way.

874
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,360
Rym: It seems like in the kitchen, everyone's talking about family.

875
00:44:00,201 --> 00:44:07,740
Rym: And in the room where the TV is, everyone's talking about either nothing or if it's a cool family, everything but family.

876
00:44:08,524 --> 00:44:09,818
Scott: Or yelling at the TV.

877
00:44:10,203 --> 00:44:10,395
Rym: Yeah.

878
00:44:10,841 --> 00:44:12,374
Scott: Oh, you piece of shit dropped the ball.

879
00:44:12,414 --> 00:44:12,999
Scott: What's wrong with TV?

880
00:44:16,181 --> 00:44:30,420
Rym: But yeah, like even in our group, like I noticed when we have our Thanksgiving-ish feast with our friends, even though like our apartment is like one big room in the front, basically, like the kitchen's kind of like just in the living room, effectively.

881
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:42,060
Rym: People like crowd into the kitchen and like stand shoulder to shoulder, like right next to the fucking oven, like getting in everyone's way trying to cook, all talking about like so-and-so friend and basically talking about the family.

882
00:44:42,521 --> 00:44:48,480
Rym: And there's like two people sitting in the entire rest of the apartment playing video games with tons of fame.

883
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:48,970
Rym: Yup.

884
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:50,779
Rym: But why?

885
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:55,379
Rym: Like there's something about like the bustle of the kitchen if everyone wants to be in on that action for some reason.

886
00:44:56,962 --> 00:44:58,766
Scott: Yeah, the smartphone also.

887
00:44:59,106 --> 00:45:05,700
Scott: A lot of people are like, you know, there's the general nonsensical lament of like, you know, smartphone ruining socialization.

888
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:08,358
Rym: Yeah, but when I was a kid, it was my mom reading a magazine going, "Uh-huh,

889
00:45:08,378 --> 00:45:08,519
Rym: uh-huh.".

890
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:09,001
Rym: Right.

891
00:45:09,061 --> 00:45:12,911
Scott: I mean, everyone's sort of pushing that now, right?

892
00:45:12,931 --> 00:45:21,860
Scott: The truth, which just wasn't pushed, which is like, yeah, you know, person had their head in a newspaper, head in a magazine, head in a book, head in a, you know, whatever.

893
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:22,312
Rym: Yup.

894
00:45:22,441 --> 00:45:24,740
Rym: Just cutting themselves with it because there isn't anything.

895
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:40,040
Scott: But the smartphone actually, you know, at Thanksgiving in particular or any family gathering, you know, there's some people who, you know, play that old blame thing of, you know, but really I think it's enhanced in a lot of ways.

896
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:40,481
Scott: Yeah.

897
00:45:40,501 --> 00:45:45,996
Rym: Well, you know, a lot of times I see like the argument starts up like, "Blackhearts are named after blah.

898
00:45:46,136 --> 00:45:47,279
Rym: I thought they were named after

899
00:45:47,339 --> 00:45:47,640
Rym: blah.".

900
00:45:47,881 --> 00:45:54,798
Rym: And instead of that turning into either like a dumb argument or just petering out, people pull out smartphones and suddenly everyone's like, "Oh, the Blackhearts were founded in 1926.

901
00:45:54,798 --> 00:45:54,918
Rym: What?".

902
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,950
Scott: There's also a lot of game playing going on like, "Hey, help me beat this candy

903
00:45:58,970 --> 00:45:59,311
Scott: crush.".

904
00:45:59,552 --> 00:46:01,076
Scott: Or, "What's that game you're playing?

905
00:46:01,096 --> 00:46:02,039
Scott: A little Hearthstone over

906
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:02,240
Scott: there?".

907
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:05,180
Rym: Oh, hey, you want to see pictures of the trip that the kids are on right now?

908
00:46:05,541 --> 00:46:10,380
Scott: Oh, hey, let me take some pictures of us right now on Thanksgiving and then tweet them to other people.

909
00:46:10,661 --> 00:46:13,380
Scott: Oh, let me take a picture of our yams that are better than everyone else's yam.

910
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:18,557
Rym: All the bored millennials who are home with their families are talking to each other being like, "Man, my Thanksgiving.

911
00:46:18,617 --> 00:46:19,058
Rym: Man, my

912
00:46:19,098 --> 00:46:19,640
Rym: Thanksgiving.".

913
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:20,662
Scott: "My turkey's better than your

914
00:46:20,702 --> 00:46:21,083
Scott: turkey.".

915
00:46:21,223 --> 00:46:21,664
Scott: Oh, my God.

916
00:46:21,844 --> 00:46:29,680
Scott: And if anyone has anything that happened to them on the Thanksgiving, like the turkey set on fire, everyone can now sit around and watch Vines if turkey's on fire.

917
00:46:30,221 --> 00:46:34,360
Scott: Her house is burning down from trying to deep fry the turkey in the garage.

918
00:46:34,921 --> 00:46:42,838
Rym: There was a time when I'd have the family hang out where the TV would be on in the background like when football wasn't happening and everyone's ignoring it.

919
00:46:42,878 --> 00:46:43,800
Rym: It's just kind of there.

920
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:56,160
Rym: But now when there's the gathering, because you got the ability to have the YouTube channel up, there will be the YouTube going and running commentary of people putting stuff into the queue and yelling and watching it.

921
00:46:56,861 --> 00:46:59,025
Rym: I kind of like that dynamic among friends and family.

922
00:46:59,045 --> 00:47:05,959
Rym: I don't like it when it happens every night and it ends up being a time waster of like, "Let me show you this YouTube video that no one wants to

923
00:47:05,979 --> 00:47:06,100
Rym: see.".

924
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:08,125
Rym: But like the Thanksgiving vibe.

925
00:47:08,145 --> 00:47:11,419
Scott: But I just want to show you this YouTube video that you don't want to see because I want you to watch it.

926
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:16,240
Rym: There's a good Steven Universe meme about that lately that once you watch the show, it's pretty good.

927
00:47:16,701 --> 00:47:27,180
Rym: But now like in the family gathering Thanksgiving situation, it's interesting because it's like all these people have different sets of memes and things they know about on the internet.

928
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:42,380
Rym: The ability now with smart TVs for everyone to like start throwing stuff into a queue in the family gathering means that there's a guaranteed stream of entertainment in that room and anyone who doesn't want to be involved can go join the kitchen crew so everybody's happy.

929
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:45,188
Scott: It also helps out with recipes for the kitchen crew.

930
00:47:45,810 --> 00:47:49,260
Scott: It also helps out with fantasy football for the living room crew.

931
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,445
Rym: Oh shit, I gotta update my team.

932
00:47:51,631 --> 00:47:52,213
Rym: Actually, I do.

933
00:47:52,475 --> 00:47:53,600
Rym: There's money on it at work.

934
00:47:54,966 --> 00:47:55,819
Scott: I don't play fantasy football.

935
00:47:56,100 --> 00:48:00,259
Rym: I don't play much, but my office is really into it for some reason.

936
00:48:01,141 --> 00:48:01,785
Scott: What office isn't?

937
00:48:01,806 --> 00:48:03,740
Scott: Mine is the one that's not into it.

938
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:06,080
Rym: If they did fantasy hockey, I'd be a lot more into it.

939
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:06,586
Scott: You can do that.

940
00:48:06,607 --> 00:48:07,012
Scott: You want to do it?

941
00:48:07,053 --> 00:48:07,559
Scott: We can set it up.

942
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,095
Rym: Yeah, no one in my office gives a shit.

943
00:48:09,115 --> 00:48:09,540
Rym: That's the problem.

944
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:11,319
Scott: You can just set it up next year, which is not your office.

945
00:48:11,562 --> 00:48:12,390
Rym: We'll do it with FRC.

946
00:48:12,411 --> 00:48:13,239
Rym: Yeah, I'll do it next year.

947
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:14,940
Scott: Set up a real fantasy hockey.

948
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:23,458
Scott: Not a now finally illegal in New York maybe daily fantasy gambling, but actual more skill and luck.

949
00:48:23,798 --> 00:48:24,420
Scott: fantasy team girls.

950
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,839
Rym: Yeah, next Tuesday's show we'll be talking about that biz.

951
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:27,764
Scott: For sure.

952
00:48:28,468 --> 00:48:30,280
Scott: Not that we haven't already said everything about it already.

953
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:32,308
Rym: Yeah, most of it will be, "Yeah, we were right.

954
00:48:32,348 --> 00:48:32,650
Rym: Told you

955
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:33,031
Rym: so.".

956
00:48:33,072 --> 00:48:34,760
Rym: But I digress.

957
00:48:35,622 --> 00:48:38,140
Rym: So, the Thanksgiving dessert.

958
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:39,844
Scott: Pie?

959
00:48:40,462 --> 00:48:42,920
Rym: Pumpkin pie is the only acceptable dessert.

960
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:44,640
Scott: I don't like pumpkin pie, so I make apple pie.

961
00:48:45,002 --> 00:48:45,899
Scott: And you can just deal with that.

962
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:47,520
Rym: Apple pie is okay as long as there's also a pumpkin pie.

963
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:48,619
Scott: Or whatever grandma baked.

964
00:48:49,583 --> 00:48:50,139
Rym: Pumpkin pie.

965
00:48:52,724 --> 00:48:53,600
Rym: It's got to be a pumpkin pie.

966
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,580
Scott: We don't do pumpkin pie.

967
00:48:55,101 --> 00:48:55,929
Rym: I don't understand.

968
00:48:56,132 --> 00:48:57,699
Scott: Pumpkin pie is- Pumpkin is not for eating.

969
00:48:59,083 --> 00:49:00,800
Rym: I don't know how you come to that conclusion.

970
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:03,200
Rym: How do you like yams and squashes and things?

971
00:49:04,461 --> 00:49:05,332
Scott: Squash isn't that good.

972
00:49:05,373 --> 00:49:05,899
Scott: A yam is good.

973
00:49:06,202 --> 00:49:09,100
Rym: Yeah, they're not that far apart in terms of the dishes that come out.

974
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:11,540
Scott: Pumpkin is for decoration.

975
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,180
Rym: What about a sweet potato pie?

976
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:15,339
Rym: Very similar structurally to a pumpkin pie.

977
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,630
Scott: I don't really eat a sweet potato pie.

978
00:49:16,651 --> 00:49:17,740
Scott: I mostly eat a sweet potato.

979
00:49:18,467 --> 00:49:19,100
Scott: And I eat a pie.

980
00:49:19,704 --> 00:49:20,600
Scott: I like a fruit pie.

981
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:25,340
Rym: I do like fruit pies, but I feel like Christmas, you got the apple pie comes out.

982
00:49:25,741 --> 00:49:27,100
Rym: And in the spring, apple season.

983
00:49:27,181 --> 00:49:28,559
Scott: I don't do Christmas because I'm not a yam.

984
00:49:30,982 --> 00:49:32,632
Scott: I got my chance for apple pies.

985
00:49:32,672 --> 00:49:34,040
Scott: Thanksgiving in the apple season.

986
00:49:34,141 --> 00:49:35,599
Scott: December is already- apples are done.

987
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:37,760
Scott: Even by Thanksgiving, apples are mostly done.

988
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:38,780
Scott: But you still got some leftovers.

989
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:43,440
Scott: But you gotta go for the apple pie while it's still fall and not winter.

990
00:49:44,522 --> 00:49:46,800
Rym: I'm a big fan of the pumpkin pie that actually uses pumpkin.

991
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:52,520
Rym: Most pumpkin pies, I've talked to those on Geek Dice a lot, are made with kind of like bullshitty squashes instead.

992
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:57,260
Rym: Because most people don't actually like for real pumpkin pie.

993
00:49:57,422 --> 00:49:57,735
Scott: I don't.

994
00:49:58,520 --> 00:49:59,820
Rym: Have you ever had a real pumpkin pie?

995
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:01,339
Scott: Yeah, that's why I learned I don't like it.

996
00:50:01,648 --> 00:50:01,877
Rym: When?

997
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:03,319
Scott: Long ass time ago.

998
00:50:04,542 --> 00:50:05,640
Rym: Maybe you'll like it now as an adult.

999
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:07,659
Rym: Because I have noticed my palate has changed a lot.

1000
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:13,940
Scott: I'm sure if I eat anything enough, I doubt it'll become a favorite food that I desire.

1001
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:21,679
Rym: Oh no, but I've noticed, especially with big Thanksgiving kind of foods, the things that I like the most have changed as I've gotten older and taste buds have started to die.

1002
00:50:22,003 --> 00:50:22,213
Scott: Yes.

1003
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:25,380
Rym: That is something that will continue probably for the rest of my life.

1004
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:25,900
Rym: Probably.

1005
00:50:27,023 --> 00:50:28,779
Scott: I was always a big fan of stuffing.

1006
00:50:29,583 --> 00:50:36,119
Scott: I ordered some Indian food the other night and I got a little chana masala because you get the little chickpeas.

1007
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:41,939
Scott: It's a lot better deal than getting like chicken tikka masala where you get like four pieces of chicken and you're done.

1008
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:43,559
Scott: You get all this curry you can't use.

1009
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,919
Scott: That thing's full of chickpeas because it caused nothing.

1010
00:50:48,922 --> 00:50:53,119
Scott: I chose the hottest possible option and it really wasn't hot.

1011
00:50:55,083 --> 00:50:56,720
Scott: It's like, oh yeah, this is definitely hot.

1012
00:50:56,941 --> 00:50:59,194
Scott: They put these two peppers in there and it feels hot.

1013
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:04,860
Rym: I find myself doubling the amount or the strength of onions and things.

1014
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:08,360
Rym: I find myself putting cayenne pepper in just everything.

1015
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:14,259
Rym: So Thanksgiving's coming real soon actually.

1016
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:17,359
Scott: The best part of Thanksgiving, you don't got to go to work.

1017
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:18,246
Rym: Yup.

1018
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:20,360
Scott: And on the day after, you don't got to go to work.

1019
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,919
Scott: And if anyone tries to make you go to work on Black Friday, you say no.

1020
00:51:24,184 --> 00:51:24,639
Rym: It depends.

1021
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,100
Rym: Retail people should not have to work.

1022
00:51:28,563 --> 00:51:30,020
Rym: It should be a national holiday.

1023
00:51:30,783 --> 00:51:32,940
Scott: Just refuse to work on Black Friday.

1024
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:40,340
Rym: But at the same time, depending on your job, I have had a lot of luck in my life working like the day after Christmas.

1025
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:42,280
Scott: What job does someone have where they can't refuse?

1026
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:43,906
Scott: Fireman.

1027
00:51:43,967 --> 00:51:44,739
Scott: Fireman go to work.

1028
00:51:46,505 --> 00:51:48,800
Rym: Are you talking about in an ideal world or the real world?

1029
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:51,640
Scott: If you work at the power plant or the sewage treatment, go to work.

1030
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:52,959
Rym: Yeah, in an ideal world.

1031
00:51:53,222 --> 00:51:54,819
Scott: If you work at the hospital, go to work.

1032
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:58,260
Rym: Yeah, like military, like you're standing on the border of North Korea.

1033
00:51:58,885 --> 00:51:59,035
Rym: Yeah.

1034
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:00,860
Scott: Alright, but they don't have Thanksgiving.

1035
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:02,220
Scott: They have a different holiday this earlier.

1036
00:52:02,663 --> 00:52:04,460
Rym: Well, there's American soldiers hanging out there.

1037
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:04,980
Scott: Oh yeah, sure.

1038
00:52:05,403 --> 00:52:07,380
Scott: I mean, they're celebrating Thanksgiving at the base or whatever.

1039
00:52:07,662 --> 00:52:07,978
Scott: They're good.

1040
00:52:09,121 --> 00:52:13,880
Scott: But I mean, if you don't have a job like that where you must go to work, you know, police, yeah, go to work.

1041
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:16,140
Scott: There's probably going to be some drunk driving on this holiday.

1042
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:17,100
Rym: You know, forget all that.

1043
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:18,220
Rym: There's a much more important thing to say.

1044
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,140
Rym: Don't buy anything on Black Friday.

1045
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:21,298
Rym: Do not encourage them.

1046
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:24,040
Scott: Professional ice hockey player, go to work on Black Friday.

1047
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,799
Scott: Professional basketball player, you can go to work on Black Friday too.

1048
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,839
Scott: I don't really care if you don't, but you probably should.

1049
00:52:35,321 --> 00:52:39,060
Scott: But yeah, most jobs, don't go to work on Black Friday even if they say to.

1050
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,380
Scott: And if they fire you, give them the finger.

1051
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:50,320
Rym: So my biggest advice to you, all of you out there, if you're in college right now and like you're getting to that point where like you can go home for Thanksgiving, like you should probably still go home for Thanksgiving.

1052
00:52:50,461 --> 00:53:02,060
Rym: But seriously, start now, get all your real friends, like not the Facebook friends, but their actual friends and pick a weekend either before or after Thanksgiving and just do your own Thanksgiving.

1053
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:06,080
Rym: And let me tell you, you're going to fuck up the turkey because you guys have never done this stuff before.

1054
00:53:06,642 --> 00:53:18,180
Rym: Like you're going to mess some stuff up, but start cooking Thanksgiving dinner for your nerd friends in college on a non-Thanksgiving day now and make it a tradition that's going to pay out in like 10 years.

1055
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:19,160
Scott: But here's the real truth.

1056
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:25,600
Scott: If you're so sad a person that you listen to GeekNights or even give us money, you probably don't have any friends even if you're in college.

1057
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,679
Rym: Scott hates all of you and us and this.

1058
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:32,400
Scott: So what you should do is to avoid Crazy Uncle Whatever.

1059
00:53:32,901 --> 00:53:48,560
Scott: Don't go to Thanksgiving with your family if they refuse to make Crazy Uncle not invited and just make your own personal fucking Thanksgiving just for you and just make all these delicious foods and you can eat all of them with nobody to fight over that giant bowl of fucking stuffing.

1060
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:50,700
Scott: You just eat all of it, just you, nobody else.

1061
00:53:50,921 --> 00:53:53,258
Scott: And be like, "Oh my God, I am the king of the

1062
00:53:53,299 --> 00:53:53,440
Scott: world.".

1063
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:58,100
Scott: Just watch the football on your own and you won't have anyone fighting with you to change the channel to some other bullshit.

1064
00:53:58,260 --> 00:53:59,080
Rym: Well, I guess think of it this way.

1065
00:53:59,341 --> 00:54:04,360
Rym: If you are someone who has... If you have family drama to where Thanksgiving...

1066
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,394
Scott: During halftime just play Rocket League and be like, "Fuck

1067
00:54:06,475 --> 00:54:06,596
Scott: you.".

1068
00:54:07,321 --> 00:54:15,019
Rym: If Thanksgiving is more stressful for you than fun because you're in that kind of life, at least once do something like Scott said and invite only your friends over.

1069
00:54:15,622 --> 00:54:16,699
Scott: I thought we said they didn't have any.

1070
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:19,497
Rym: No, but you got to have something or make some friends.

1071
00:54:19,538 --> 00:54:19,840
Rym: I don't know.

1072
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:23,380
Scott: Your friend, the turkey, kill him and set him on fire until he is delicious.

1073
00:54:24,041 --> 00:54:34,597
Rym: Because a couple of years ago, Emily and I had started, we try to not go home over major holidays and try to convince our family, "We'll do our Christmasy celebration some other weekend around

1074
00:54:34,638 --> 00:54:35,080
Rym: Christmas.".

1075
00:54:35,603 --> 00:54:38,379
Rym: But we just stayed home on Christmas last year.

1076
00:54:39,541 --> 00:54:41,959
Rym: Oh my God, was that the best...

1077
00:54:42,201 --> 00:54:44,599
Scott: You should try the better Christmas option.

1078
00:54:47,143 --> 00:54:49,240
Rym: Go to Costa Rica, like Tropical Island?

1079
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:50,297
Scott: Well, that's a really good option.

1080
00:54:51,182 --> 00:54:55,620
Scott: I'm talking about the normal better Christmas option, which is movie plus Chinese food.

1081
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:56,368
Rym: Oh, we did that.

1082
00:54:56,591 --> 00:54:57,119
Rym: We did that.

1083
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:57,964
Scott: You know what?

1084
00:54:57,984 --> 00:55:03,279
Scott: I want to say this year, this year there is a rare event.

1085
00:55:04,601 --> 00:55:07,500
Scott: Usually it takes a whole fucking lot to get me to go see a movie.

1086
00:55:08,364 --> 00:55:09,699
Rym: Oh, I see where you're going with this.

1087
00:55:10,243 --> 00:55:16,039
Scott: And usually on Christmas, there's maybe one movie, maybe, to go see in the theater on the Christmastime, maybe.

1088
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:18,220
Scott: And you pick the best option of what's available.

1089
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:21,659
Scott: This year, there is a double must-see.

1090
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:23,860
Scott: It's got a Christmas double feature.

1091
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:26,359
Scott: You got to eat your Chinese food between or after both of them.

1092
00:55:27,642 --> 00:55:32,554
Scott: You have Star Wars, which remains to be seen if it's must-see, but yeah, you're going to see it.

1093
00:55:32,575 --> 00:55:32,880
Rym: You're a nerd.

1094
00:55:33,103 --> 00:55:34,139
Rym: Never forget, you guys.

1095
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,018
Rym: You know how hype you are now?

1096
00:55:37,647 --> 00:55:40,540
Scott: Even if George Lucas made this one, which he isn't, you would go see it.

1097
00:55:41,329 --> 00:55:41,900
Scott: So shut up.

1098
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,480
Rym: You were just as hype before Jar Jar Binks.

1099
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:45,944
Scott: Right.

1100
00:55:46,165 --> 00:55:50,000
Scott: And also, the double feature, you got Hateful Eight.

1101
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:53,075
Scott: So two movie Christmastime.

1102
00:55:53,377 --> 00:55:53,799
Scott: Watch out.

1103
00:55:54,521 --> 00:55:55,058
Rym: Daddy two.

1104
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:55,745
Scott: Daddy two.

1105
00:55:55,867 --> 00:55:56,352
Scott: Rare year.

1106
00:55:56,373 --> 00:55:56,494
Scott: Rare.

1107
00:56:03,601 --> 00:56:05,740
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1108
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:10,860
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1109
00:56:11,261 --> 00:56:16,300
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1110
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:19,220
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1111
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:23,980
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1113
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:31,740
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1114
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:34,940
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1115
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:55,385
Rym: Thank you, Patrons.

1116
00:56:55,446 --> 00:56:58,480
Rym: For once, you guys actually got to kind of pick the episode.

1117
00:56:59,025 --> 00:57:06,900
Rym: So in the future when we do this, as I said, you will actually be able to vote on the specific topic from the submissions.

1118
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:10,440
Rym: We'll take up a nominations process and then a voting process.

1119
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:11,519
Rym: So it should be fun.

1120
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:13,764
Rym: And stay tuned.

1121
00:57:14,166 --> 00:57:16,920
Rym: This weekend, we're actually starting up GeekNights Presents again.

1122
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:21,520
Rym: We're at least doing some pre-production and we're going to start that show again real soon.

1123
00:57:21,680 --> 00:58:29,387
Rym: So now, in order of the amount of money they're giving us, the Patrons of this episode are... And now I present to you... Yes, I do.

1124
00:58:31,555 --> 00:58:32,889
Rym: You and your pussycat nose.

1125
00:58:35,091 --> 00:58:36,349
Rym: What's new, pussycat?

1126
00:58:37,391 --> 00:58:39,076
