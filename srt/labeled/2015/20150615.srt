00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,229
Rym: It's Monday, June 15th, 2015.

Rym: Let's do this.

00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:46,512
Rym: So I was unduly productive over the weekend because I had a bunch of you know I had a panel from PAX South and then a bunch of other video from PAX South and a panel from PAX East Bunch of other video from PAX East and I had to like edit that shit together so I can put it on YouTube like we've been Kind of dormant on YouTube for a while.

8
00:00:46,532 --> 00:00:47,900
Rym: We've just been really busy with other stuff.

9
00:00:48,302 --> 00:00:49,568
Scott: I'm gonna be not dormant on.

10
00:00:49,628 --> 00:00:51,175
Scott: Saturday is a big netrunner tournament.

11
00:00:51,256 --> 00:00:53,369
Scott: live stream Live stream.

12
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:54,920
Scott: reach out if their internet works.

13
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,208
Scott: I'm watching and to get there.

14
00:00:56,268 --> 00:00:56,993
Scott: bring all this shit.

15
00:00:57,214 --> 00:00:58,160
Scott: their internet's not gonna work.

16
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:04,930
Rym: Well, then you just got to record it all and upload it or live stream over LTE Like one megabit per second or something.

17
00:01:04,971 --> 00:01:05,333
Rym: I don't know.

18
00:01:05,352 --> 00:01:05,695
Rym: Hey for that.

19
00:01:05,976 --> 00:01:06,842
Rym: I don't know What?

20
00:01:06,923 --> 00:01:08,560
Rym: don't you have free unlimited bandwidth or anything?

21
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,039
Scott: You don't have free unlimited LTE?

22
00:01:11,066 --> 00:01:12,359
Rym: I could get away with a lot as Teemo.

23
00:01:13,581 --> 00:01:17,215
Scott: Anyway, so live streaming from like 11 a.m.

24
00:01:17,275 --> 00:01:22,380
Rym: To 2 in the morning Independently of that the you know Adobe.

25
00:01:22,821 --> 00:01:32,979
Rym: We know a lot of people who are running like some crazy old ass version of like Premiere like they bought production premium or something like Four or five years ago.

26
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:33,542
Rym: Well, if you don't

27
00:01:33,562 --> 00:01:45,760
Scott: have a lot of money and you did save up your money and spend thousands of dollars on that a long Time ago and it still gets the job done Why would you start paying 50 bucks a month to get creative cloud if the old one is still working for you?

28
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:50,200
Scott: And you don't aren't like getting files from people with creative cloud that you need to be compatible.

29
00:01:51,244 --> 00:02:04,835
Rym: There is a case to be made there if you don't use the software that much and you already own one of those old versions Sure, but a lot of people say they don't want to upgrade Because like it's not better or they don't trust those.

30
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:05,898
Scott: those are the same people.

31
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:07,024
Scott: listen You should up.

32
00:02:07,346 --> 00:02:14,060
Scott: I'm not talking that anybody Should be upgrading to like beta untested versions that you know pre releases.

33
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:20,024
Rym: But if you have like a production pipeline of creative stuff, you should just always be Use the.

34
00:02:20,085 --> 00:02:20,947
Scott: no not just Adobe.

35
00:02:20,987 --> 00:02:21,628
Scott: like everything.

36
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:27,166
Scott: Windows update if there's updates in Windows update install them and video driver if there's an update Install.

37
00:02:27,207 --> 00:02:28,740
Rym: so did you see with Windows 10?

38
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,025
Rym: What are the great things they're doing?

39
00:02:30,145 --> 00:02:33,779
Rym: if you have the home version you cannot defer or prevent updates?

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,084
Rym: They just happen.

41
00:02:36,325 --> 00:02:37,269
Rym: Fuck you good.

42
00:02:37,309 --> 00:02:37,751
Scott: I like that.

43
00:02:37,811 --> 00:02:38,353
Rym: Yeah, I like that.

44
00:02:38,373 --> 00:02:40,040
Scott: It's like if there's a new version of Chrome.

45
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,691
Scott: I mean, it's just updating without you doing anything, but you should just update.

46
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:48,045
Rym: I prefer Firebird version 3.1 If you know.

47
00:02:48,065 --> 00:02:49,834
Scott: if you're using Linux just app.

48
00:02:49,894 --> 00:02:51,120
Scott: get this to upgrade.

49
00:02:51,742 --> 00:02:53,267
Scott: Get upgrade whenever right.

50
00:02:53,327 --> 00:02:54,612
Scott: just if there's upgrades get them.

51
00:02:54,772 --> 00:02:57,100
Scott: you should upgrade everything all the time constantly.

52
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,049
Scott: you know some person's gonna be like oh my Predictions.

53
00:03:00,191 --> 00:03:00,818
Scott: it's like whatever.

54
00:03:01,522 --> 00:03:02,084
Scott: Give a shit.

55
00:03:02,184 --> 00:03:02,706
Scott: Well fine.

56
00:03:02,847 --> 00:03:06,640
Scott: I've done this on every computer forever and I have less computer problems than everybody.

57
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,645
Rym: You know what I'd say if you're.

58
00:03:07,685 --> 00:03:10,700
Scott: one of those reasons is because I update and patch everything.

59
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,884
Scott: I'm very.

60
00:03:12,044 --> 00:03:16,920
Rym: if your pipeline is such that it's that prone to disruption and disruption is that bad.

61
00:03:17,442 --> 00:03:18,930
Rym: You should have a UAT environment.

62
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:23,846
Scott: Anyway, obviously, so I Heavily update everything.

63
00:03:23,906 --> 00:03:30,106
Scott: I'm super up-to-date on patches and that's one of the reasons my shit always works great But anyway, not enough to derail.

64
00:03:30,447 --> 00:03:37,565
Rym: so especially with Premiere and like video editing workflows Premiere 4 is Kind of garbage.

65
00:03:38,006 --> 00:03:50,372
Scott: Well, I had Premiere Elements before like when you're in beacon Wow, and that was Way garbage compared to the real Premiere But I've been so that's better that premiere elements was better than like premiere.

66
00:03:50,653 --> 00:03:58,497
Rym: like guys if you edit video And you're not using like the most recent Adobe Creative Cloud premiere

67
00:03:58,517 --> 00:03:59,179
Scott: or Final Cut

68
00:03:59,681 --> 00:04:05,305
Rym: The Creative Cloud is like breaking away from the pack at least with premieres specifically Which

69
00:04:05,366 --> 00:04:06,776
Scott: is a Mac only thing anyway,

70
00:04:06,957 --> 00:04:13,160
Rym: yeah The only reason the thing I'm about to say happened is because I'm on the updated version.

71
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:20,906
Rym: So I found like oh, yeah, Dave Riley and AJ did this great panel at Connecticut like years ago Yeah, and I videoed it.

72
00:04:20,966 --> 00:04:22,412
Rym: cuz I video like everything like.

73
00:04:22,473 --> 00:04:24,300
Rym: I have like tons of old videos.

74
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,420
Scott: I got lots of video of stuff and lots of photos of stuff that it is not posted any.

75
00:04:28,561 --> 00:04:37,363
Rym: Yeah, and in that same directory I also had a panel that Luke Crane did like at 2013 at a PAX and I was like, oh, right I had these things.

76
00:04:37,423 --> 00:04:47,085
Rym: I had the audio and like everything into directory and I never done anything with him because it's a pain in The ass like sync everything up and you know, just do all the stuff but I don't.

77
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:57,096
Rym: there's a feature now where you can take a whole bunch of just clips just random crap and just say hey synchronize this via the audio and Premiere just figures that out.

78
00:04:57,701 --> 00:05:09,140
Rym: Yep, so I did that and now I have this panel that Dave Riley did in 2012 at Connecticut This other panel Luke Crane did in 2013 at PAX and they're already on YouTube.

79
00:05:09,603 --> 00:05:12,160
Rym: I'm just gonna make him go live like in a couple days.

80
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,319
Rym: The only reason I didn't do it today is because I just uploaded two other videos.

81
00:05:16,301 --> 00:05:29,004
Scott: one of the other things the feature they added somewhat recently ish is in if you're doing speed grade or any kind of color grading instead of like sitting there twiddling with all the color grading settings because you Don't know anything about those.

82
00:05:29,045 --> 00:05:31,213
Scott: cuz you're not you're me and you're not a professional.

83
00:05:31,454 --> 00:05:32,700
Rym: Well, you're means you're me too.

84
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,623
Rym: You're all of us.

85
00:05:33,944 --> 00:05:34,526
Rym: You can just.

86
00:05:34,566 --> 00:05:38,880
Scott: you can just find a photo any photograph that's already graded like the way you want.

87
00:05:39,702 --> 00:05:44,378
Scott: Drag that photo in and it will grade the video to match the color grading in that photo.

88
00:05:44,418 --> 00:05:46,237
Rym: Whoa How well does that work?

89
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,979
Scott: It'll even do it across.

90
00:05:48,461 --> 00:05:55,762
Scott: You can drag in a whole bunch of different video files into the sequence from different cameras and such and it will grade all of Them because

91
00:05:55,883 --> 00:06:09,800
Rym: I just always started really playing around with Lumetri looks which are kind of like baby's first color grading And they already work like way Way better than what I used to do of like trying to set like a luminosity curve or whatever for a video.

92
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:15,189
Scott: Well, I mean they work better if you record the video Yeah, the great contrast is possible.

93
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:20,740
Scott: Yeah, so if you want if you want to color grade from now on I'll record the videos in the big grade.

94
00:06:21,001 --> 00:06:27,240
Rym: No, I don't because that means that there's another step that I have to do or I otherwise the video will look gray.

95
00:06:27,601 --> 00:06:34,840
Rym: Yeah, yeah, no I use color grading just to make my arb like pretty badly put together video look a little bit better.

96
00:06:35,801 --> 00:06:44,424
Rym: Anyway, anyway, so yeah, I got a bunch of YouTube videos Thanks to the fact that I just upgrade my software and yeah, like new features come all the time All right.

97
00:06:44,565 --> 00:06:46,977
Rym: Yeah, so it's Monday not the lounge.

98
00:06:47,017 --> 00:06:47,559
Rym: It's tech day.

99
00:06:49,321 --> 00:06:54,180
Scott: So those big Apple news and for once we didn't talk about it till way after just cuz of how scheduling work.

100
00:06:54,341 --> 00:06:57,239
Scott: Usually Apple news seems to always come inside with Monday shows.

101
00:06:58,022 --> 00:06:58,986
Scott: I guess this time it didn't.

102
00:06:59,026 --> 00:07:02,900
Scott: so the WDC happened which is what they usually announce stuff developers care about.

103
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,972
Scott: Yeah, but really there were it was pretty minor.

104
00:07:06,032 --> 00:07:16,422
Scott: It's just like yeah, we're making a new OS X. We're doing the same thing We always do which is take features that everyone else has had for a long long time and bring them over to our platforms Right.

105
00:07:16,824 --> 00:07:20,099
Scott: There are really only a few things that were interesting at all.

106
00:07:21,664 --> 00:07:27,650
Scott: the first one is That they have their language Swift.

107
00:07:28,092 --> 00:07:30,740
Scott: that was the language they invented for writing iOS apps.

108
00:07:31,364 --> 00:07:33,359
Scott: They're gonna just open source that whole language.

109
00:07:34,262 --> 00:07:35,105
Scott: What does that mean?

110
00:07:35,145 --> 00:07:40,120
Scott: Well, hopefully if they're being true to their word, they're actually gonna fully open source the language.

111
00:07:40,783 --> 00:07:48,797
Scott: It means you'll be able to use the Swift programming language to program anything You could make a Windows game or an Android app or a website.

112
00:07:49,238 --> 00:07:52,267
Rym: Oh Is actually pretty big news.

113
00:07:52,327 --> 00:07:57,127
Rym: if it really happens like fully the way if you're a Swift developer You won't just be a useless.

114
00:07:57,168 --> 00:08:01,809
Scott: if you learn Swift you won't just be Learning, you know how to make iOS apps.

115
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:04,600
Scott: It's like a language that you can use and use for everything.

116
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:04,982
Scott: So it.

117
00:08:05,263 --> 00:08:21,486
Scott: I think the reason they're doing this is to encourage people to learn Swift right to increase the size of that community around their language because obviously Swift is gonna be best at writing iOS apps, which is what it was invented for Mac or Mac apps.

118
00:08:21,566 --> 00:08:27,080
Scott: Yeah, so by making it open source, it means like they don't make any money selling it directly.

119
00:08:28,461 --> 00:08:42,148
Rym: They can build this community and get more people to develop things for Macs and to buy Macs to use this language as opposed to say, you know Java is supposed to be the you know, use this code anywhere but Exists in a different ecosystem.

120
00:08:42,308 --> 00:08:44,559
Rym: Oracle's kind of mismanaged it for a long time.

121
00:08:45,142 --> 00:08:48,980
Scott: Son may also manage it right and also because the language is open-sourced, right?

122
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,540
Scott: That doesn't just mean that anyone can use it for anything and anyone can make libraries for it.

123
00:08:53,600 --> 00:09:06,758
Scott: It means that someone can go out there can make a patch for Swift that changes the language and Send it to Apple and possibly have it be included in the official, you know, like in Xcode or whatever.

124
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:09,116
Scott: Yeah Anyway, that was interesting.

125
00:09:10,602 --> 00:09:12,433
Scott: How far they actually take that right.

126
00:09:12,534 --> 00:09:15,184
Rym: like if you're a kid in college Switch the language.

127
00:09:15,204 --> 00:09:16,651
Scott: You should probably just learn it doesn't hurt.

128
00:09:16,852 --> 00:09:17,656
Scott: Yeah, it's not bad.

129
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,985
Scott: Um Let's see any other.

130
00:09:20,025 --> 00:09:21,148
Scott: they're making a music thing.

131
00:09:21,189 --> 00:09:22,072
Scott: No one gives a shit.

132
00:09:22,112 --> 00:09:22,413
Rym: Yeah.

133
00:09:23,035 --> 00:09:24,600
Scott: Oh, here's an interesting one, right?

134
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:31,420
Scott: I remember they're making an app for Android that makes it easy to switch over to iOS.

135
00:09:31,581 --> 00:09:40,654
Scott: You put this on your Android phone you you open it up you get your new iPhone You just bought and it'll copy over a whole bunch of stuff to ease your transition.

136
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,680
Rym: That's a really good idea.

137
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,813
Scott: Well, it's not like Android can possibly do this with iOS.

138
00:09:46,873 --> 00:09:49,160
Scott: It's there right there blocking you from doing that.

139
00:09:49,461 --> 00:09:55,700
Scott: Yeah, if you tried to submit a migrate to Android app for iOS into the App Store that shit ain't getting approved.

140
00:09:55,881 --> 00:09:57,767
Rym: I said it's a really good idea.

141
00:09:58,007 --> 00:09:59,352
Scott: That's a big guy.

142
00:09:59,452 --> 00:10:01,900
Scott: You know, that could be a trust issue even right?

143
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:09,220
Rym: We'll see what happens with that, but I will admit, you know My phone exploded not that long ago, and I didn't want to buy a new phone yet.

144
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,420
Rym: Because even if I want to go iPhone, I mean September's coming like I'm not gonna buy a phone now.

145
00:10:14,141 --> 00:10:22,094
Rym: Literally right now like this month Probably the worst possible time to buy an iPhone might as well just wait a little bit.

146
00:10:22,215 --> 00:10:24,683
Scott: all the new Apple stuff happens in September October.

147
00:10:24,723 --> 00:10:35,583
Scott: guys in this year since iPhone 6 came out last year it's gonna be iPhone 6s and It's gonna be a bad idea to buy it because it's only gonna be a little bit better than the iPhone 6 unless I have an iPhone.

148
00:10:35,603 --> 00:10:38,720
Rym: if you're on like the five and you need a new one five is a great phone.

149
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,088
Scott: Well, you don't need a new one if you got a five.

150
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:47,221
Scott: Yeah, some people might maybe they broke theirs I don't know but next year September there's gonna be the iPhone 7 guaranteed 100%.

151
00:10:47,221 --> 00:10:50,640
Scott: I can't wait till next year and then that is the phone you should buy.

152
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,199
Scott: I'll be buying it because I have iPhone 6 that I or anyway.

153
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:58,476
Scott: But this year is the year that there's gonna be a huge step up in iPads.

154
00:10:58,516 --> 00:11:01,519
Scott: since last September There's only a little bit step up in iPads.

155
00:11:01,941 --> 00:11:05,732
Scott: There's gonna be a big step up in iPads now and they just announced in the new iOS.

156
00:11:06,134 --> 00:11:09,363
Scott: They're gonna support side-by-side Multitasking.

157
00:11:09,403 --> 00:11:15,500
Scott: so like you can actually have two apps open actually fully open at once and see them both at one.

158
00:11:15,701 --> 00:11:17,711
Rym: Oh, it's like a laptop computer.

159
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:19,539
Rym: It's like Windows 3.1 all over again.

160
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,483
Scott: Yeah, right.

161
00:11:20,745 --> 00:11:24,380
Scott: and then like this is really useful for copy and pasting from one to the other.

162
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,945
Rym: It's really useful for everything.

163
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:34,365
Scott: that's watching you watching a YouTube video in the corner while you write something in Google Drive or This is why The Windows interfaces.

164
00:11:34,426 --> 00:11:39,700
Rym: people were going down that road of just have one big window like one big screen like full screen every app.

165
00:11:39,821 --> 00:11:40,899
Scott: Well, they're still limiting it.

166
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:48,900
Scott: Your choices are basically split the screen in half Make one app sort of sneak in on the side or the app uses a special API like the YouTube one.

167
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,328
Scott: So I just play a video in the corner.

168
00:11:50,348 --> 00:11:52,640
Rym: I'm just talking, forget technology, I'm talking purely from UX perspective.

169
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,390
Rym: Microsoft and Apple both had this road.

170
00:11:55,451 --> 00:12:10,053
Scott: They were going down Apple much more so of Monolithic full-screen apps doing things on computers because most people the vast majority of people I think even using a you know multitask user interface Tend to just maximize one app that they're using except that you think that.

171
00:12:10,154 --> 00:12:13,347
Rym: but I was thinking about this a lot because I do UX my day job.

172
00:12:13,387 --> 00:12:15,840
Scott: Well, this is why see people do that on Windows.

173
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:25,713
Scott: I think the thing is on OS X. they reason they don't let you maximize things properly was to force people to Realize they could and multitask.

174
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:31,760
Scott: right if you look at Apple users they rarely full even like full screen was a recent feature.

175
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:38,640
Scott: People rarely full screen usually have a cluttered-ass screen full of windows open sort of like a Windows prison as a cluttered-ass screen icon.

176
00:12:38,741 --> 00:12:44,160
Scott: yeah, right because Maximizing doesn't really fucking work properly the way it does in Windows.

177
00:12:44,522 --> 00:12:53,260
Scott: So you're you know, you sort of forced into this multi window multitasking People who have to use computers to do boring crap at their jobs.

178
00:12:53,822 --> 00:13:02,520
Rym: Pretty much everything they do involves having multiple windows of things open at the same time and looking at the same time Looking at a spreadsheet and typing something into something else.

179
00:13:03,341 --> 00:13:04,626
Rym: Yeah, or right now what I got?

180
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:09,105
Rym: I got audition up and then next to that in the same monitor I got the next news thing.

181
00:13:09,145 --> 00:13:11,353
Rym: We're gonna talk about and then on the second monitor.

182
00:13:11,434 --> 00:13:13,080
Rym: I got a notepad or I'm taking show notes.

183
00:13:14,184 --> 00:13:20,534
Scott: but anyway the You know, this is even good for just having a candy box next to a web browser.

184
00:13:20,976 --> 00:13:22,000
Rym: that's no that's bad.

185
00:13:23,281 --> 00:13:27,120
Scott: It's heavy candy box always open on the side while you get your real stuff going on the other side.

186
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,871
Scott: But anyway, this is apparently on the big iPad.

187
00:13:29,951 --> 00:13:32,120
Scott: It's gonna work better than on the smaller iPad.

188
00:13:33,441 --> 00:13:39,099
Scott: Maybe depending on what they announced in September I might get the full size iPad instead of the mini iPad that I have now.

189
00:13:39,743 --> 00:13:48,239
Scott: Because the problem with the mini iPad I have now the only thing really wrong with it Is that it only has 16 gigs of storage and Apple fucking rips you off and they're not gonna stop ripping you off.

190
00:13:48,479 --> 00:13:56,109
Scott: to get The 128 gig one you basically to pay two or three hundred extra dollars, dude I can get a 128 gig USB stick for like 30 bucks.

191
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:02,529
Scott: and you're telling me that to put 128 gigs inside the iPad instead of 16 I got to pay 300.

192
00:14:02,529 --> 00:14:07,187
Scott: Oh my god go fuck yourself, but I sort of have no choice because It really doesn't work.

193
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:09,580
Scott: Well with 16 gigs you fill that shit up so fast.

194
00:14:09,721 --> 00:14:12,760
Scott: I'd like delete apps like it's the DOS days because I'm running out of storage.

195
00:14:13,141 --> 00:14:14,807
Scott: Yeah, I put photos on here.

196
00:14:14,867 --> 00:14:19,219
Rym: you think now like what I have paid this much money amortized over the time I've owned this thing.

197
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:25,561
Scott: I think I think they should be legally required to have an open storage slot where you can put an SD card in and fuck You.

198
00:14:25,942 --> 00:14:28,509
Rym: yeah, cuz SD cards are tiny.

199
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,335
Scott: I think it's price-fixing too.

200
00:14:30,796 --> 00:14:33,446
Scott: I think right maybe FTC?

201
00:14:33,526 --> 00:14:34,575
Scott: I would say it's price-fixing.

202
00:14:34,616 --> 00:14:35,100
Scott: I say Apple.

203
00:14:35,581 --> 00:14:40,957
Scott: Why is this one three hundred dollars more than that one when the only difference in parts whatsoever is this $30 chip?

204
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:46,074
Rym: Why you can unless they're a man, how is that not price-fixing?

205
00:14:46,114 --> 00:14:47,540
Rym: That's not what price-fixing means.

206
00:14:47,848 --> 00:14:56,160
Rym: Okay Price-fixing would be if they coordinated with other tablet manufacturers to make sure no one had expandable storage and they all agreed to do that.

207
00:14:56,981 --> 00:14:58,206
Rym: Then you could go after.

208
00:14:58,246 --> 00:14:59,472
Scott: we need a new term for whatever.

209
00:14:59,512 --> 00:15:00,978
Scott: this is because it should be illegal.

210
00:15:01,038 --> 00:15:02,084
Scott: if it's not You know what it is.

211
00:15:02,124 --> 00:15:03,089
Rym: I'll tell you what the term is.

212
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,980
Rym: It's Apple gouging Apple.

213
00:15:05,301 --> 00:15:06,829
Scott: Is that illegal?

214
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,919
Rym: You don't gouge an apple you take a bite out of it.

215
00:15:11,526 --> 00:15:23,854
Rym: So fuckers there's a big initiative among the US government the British government and other governments in general to Basically either weaken encryption by making legal requirements to have backdoors.

216
00:15:24,014 --> 00:15:24,195
Rym: Nope.

217
00:15:24,395 --> 00:15:25,940
Rym: or to outlaw encryption.

218
00:15:26,101 --> 00:15:28,716
Rym: Nope, this has been a thing since the 80s.

219
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,960
Rym: Yeah, I mean we've talked about this on GeekNights before but it's coming up.

220
00:15:33,582 --> 00:15:38,198
Scott: You know the EFF that they exist because of this court case from a long time ago with PGP.

221
00:15:38,499 --> 00:15:42,708
Rym: yep Was regular, you know pretty good encryption.

222
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:45,014
Rym: It was basically or pretty good privacy.

223
00:15:45,034 --> 00:15:45,856
Rym: I guess it stood for us.

224
00:15:46,197 --> 00:15:49,011
Rym: It wasn't about a Powerful encryption system.

225
00:15:49,454 --> 00:16:03,827
Rym: that was very much Yeah Mathematically simple easy to use and it was classified by the US government and other shitty governments as a weapon and banned from exports and The only so you were.

226
00:16:03,887 --> 00:16:10,389
Rym: technically it was illegal to explain to someone who was not an American citizen How to use it, but every American everyone knew this math.

227
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,415
Scott: It's not a real secret.

228
00:16:12,495 --> 00:16:14,965
Rym: So there was this crazy shenanigans That's like Zimmerman.

229
00:16:15,006 --> 00:16:17,040
Scott: Don't tell the Russians about multiplication.

230
00:16:17,261 --> 00:16:18,547
Rym: They they can't know.

231
00:16:18,748 --> 00:16:25,532
Rym: they published the source code as a printed book Exported the book and then someone typed it back in to get around the law, right?

232
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:32,680
Rym: So this bullshit is not new but it's escalating Partly because the snowed by the way, we won that case a long time ago.

233
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,979
Rym: we did but the governments of the world are frantically trying to put that genie back in the bottle.

234
00:16:36,999 --> 00:16:44,279
Rym: and they could succeed because the one thing that Trump's encryption is Guns, basically, right?

235
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:50,515
Scott: So give me your private key or you will die to highlight in my opinion the necessity.

236
00:16:50,595 --> 00:16:52,099
Scott: I've already destroyed my private key.

237
00:16:52,903 --> 00:16:54,370
Scott: Yep, you're shooting me.

238
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,114
Scott: We'll get you nowhere.

239
00:16:55,154 --> 00:16:56,219
Scott: That's that's the way to go.

240
00:16:56,561 --> 00:16:58,066
Rym: But there's other ways to use that.

241
00:16:58,126 --> 00:17:05,228
Rym: for example, I have incriminating information on the government basically Blackmail against some sort of corruption.

242
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:09,200
Rym: I put that data in an encrypted store publicly.

243
00:17:09,622 --> 00:17:11,368
Rym: There's millions of copies of it.

244
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:12,694
Rym: It cannot be destroyed.

245
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:16,093
Rym: the key Some people have that key.

246
00:17:16,113 --> 00:17:18,625
Rym: I Might not have that key.

247
00:17:18,987 --> 00:17:20,131
Rym: someone has the key.

248
00:17:20,532 --> 00:17:29,780
Rym: if Scott sets me on fire Someone who has the key finds out because I didn't check in and then that data magically gets revealed to the world.

249
00:17:30,001 --> 00:17:35,659
Scott: So basically like oh if you destroy me the date the information that you were trying to keep secret will be revealed and right.

250
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:40,519
Scott: so You can't touch me Unless you're willing to you know, get the blackmail revealed on you.

251
00:17:40,761 --> 00:17:51,591
Rym: another aspect of encryption is that it's actually a fundamental component of actually being able to put data in places Anonymously, it's a big part of that.

252
00:17:52,234 --> 00:18:09,480
Rym: so to combine those two things There's a story here that apparently is not an uncommon story where a journalist in India used a Facebook page to publish information about some government corruption and He though he posted under pseudonym people figured out who he was tracked him down and the police burned him alive.

253
00:18:09,921 --> 00:18:11,266
Scott: The police burned him alive.

254
00:18:11,307 --> 00:18:14,759
Scott: That is what appears to have happened wouldn't I mean if in the United States?

255
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:17,777
Rym: Well, the police better get on arresting these people.

256
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:22,737
Scott: no I mean even I would you know, even if police burn someone alive, right?

257
00:18:24,802 --> 00:18:26,028
Scott: In that case, right?

258
00:18:26,048 --> 00:18:30,806
Scott: I mean if they shoot someone it's like there's a police protocol for that They burn someone alive.

259
00:18:31,447 --> 00:18:32,751
Scott: the FBI would come happen.

260
00:18:32,992 --> 00:18:33,293
Rym: Yep.

261
00:18:33,373 --> 00:18:40,680
Rym: So there are big investigations everything going on But isn't there an FBI of India there is but I have a it's also corrupt.

262
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,986
Rym: That's my suspicion.

263
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:45,100
Scott: see as you know, well, I'm sure every part of the US government is corrupt.

264
00:18:45,381 --> 00:18:48,149
Scott: I sort of get a feeling that the FBI is slightly less corrupt.

265
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:52,420
Rym: if our government was that corrupt like a lot like Snowden wouldn't Be alive today.

266
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,126
Scott: It's like as much corruption as we have.

267
00:18:54,246 --> 00:18:58,623
Scott: like the amount of corruption that goes on everywhere else in the world is actually way way Worse.

268
00:18:58,663 --> 00:19:00,299
Scott: It's the point where like people are just used to it.

269
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:06,714
Rym: Yeah I mean a cop pulls you over in the US like you can't just slip him a $50 bill and expect that that's gonna make it be okay.

270
00:19:06,795 --> 00:19:10,086
Scott: that will make it worse Right now many areas.

271
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:12,572
Scott: if you're in Italy, you're just expected to slip over.

272
00:19:12,592 --> 00:19:14,016
Scott: Yeah a $50 bill.

273
00:19:14,257 --> 00:19:14,597
Scott: That's so.

274
00:19:14,618 --> 00:19:26,269
Rym: that's what you do Basically, I mean I urge you to read this because even if this isn't a concern in the US encryption and Anonymous speech on the internet like actually anonymous speech.

275
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:34,679
Rym: the same, you know system that allows 8chan gamergate bullshit to happen Could be used to prevent this journalist from being murdered.

276
00:19:35,301 --> 00:19:51,610
Rym: So encryption and anonymous speech come with a whole bunch of bad consequences both society and technologically But the consequences of not having them are far worse and if governments start pushing to actually ban this stuff You really need to be mad enough about that to do something.

277
00:19:51,971 --> 00:19:57,268
Scott: on a tangent if you're the one being black mailed for pretty much Anything ever there's only two possibilities.

278
00:19:57,528 --> 00:20:01,320
Scott: one you did or are guilty of whatever someone's going blackmailing.

279
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:05,275
Rym: I already have my counterpoint ready for you or be you're not guilty.

280
00:20:05,295 --> 00:20:08,846
Scott: All right, you're guilty Just admit it so they can't black now.

281
00:20:08,886 --> 00:20:09,789
Rym: Here's the blackmail.

282
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:13,460
Rym: I'm a Russian politician where homosexuality is basically illegal.

283
00:20:13,701 --> 00:20:15,968
Rym: Okay, blackmail is proof that I'm homosexual.

284
00:20:16,129 --> 00:20:16,791
Scott: it just admit it.

285
00:20:17,292 --> 00:20:19,600
Rym: and then what I get kicked out of office and possibly jailed.

286
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:20,605
Scott: That's tough shit.

287
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:21,509
Scott: You just got deal with it.

288
00:20:22,091 --> 00:20:22,714
Rym: You what do you mean?

289
00:20:22,734 --> 00:20:23,739
Rym: You just got to deal with it.

290
00:20:24,222 --> 00:20:27,240
Scott: I mean, you know stand up for being gay and then you know.

291
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,020
Scott: Maybe you'll think that'll help fix things.

292
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:34,920
Rym: Don't you think you could do better by being in the government as an incognito gay and then working to undermine the system?

293
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,309
Rym: What if you're the right?

294
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,159
Scott: is that ever worked?

295
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:46,367
Rym: There were a lot of moderately high-profile Nazis who were actually agents who were working hard on stuff like that Like stuff.

296
00:20:46,387 --> 00:20:47,252
Rym: that stuff happens.

297
00:20:47,474 --> 00:20:48,299
Scott: Are you saying that?

298
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,147
Scott: The gay Russian politician is a spy.

299
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:51,809
Scott: All right, fine.

300
00:20:51,869 --> 00:20:55,280
Rym: What if this journalist here who was murdered by the police in India?

301
00:20:56,064 --> 00:21:06,600
Rym: Someone a third party broke his encryption and blackmailed him saying look Pay me money, or I'll reveal to the police that you're the one who exposes their corruption.

302
00:21:07,043 --> 00:21:08,614
Scott: I'd be like leave the country.

303
00:21:08,835 --> 00:21:11,085
Rym: All right, I reveal Yeah, that that that is an option.

304
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:16,120
Rym: but then again like Simon rosy like you got attacked way outside of his country of origin.

305
00:21:16,782 --> 00:21:19,150
Rym: Multiple times people chased him.

306
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:22,180
Rym: how many people were murdered by the KGB outside of Russia?

307
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:29,049
Scott: Just saying well Letterman admitted to having sex with like his staff When someone tried to blackmail him.

308
00:21:29,089 --> 00:21:39,940
Rym: if it's not a Scene to cause him if it's not a situation like that Like where the thing that you're guilty of is not and should not be a crime, but you'll be murdered or fucked for it.

309
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:45,898
Rym: Anyway, yeah post your like Sonic the Hedgehog furry porn and cosplay outfit and be like, yep.

310
00:21:46,018 --> 00:21:46,359
Rym: That was me.

311
00:21:47,061 --> 00:21:48,725
Rym: Yep, I'm still running for president.

312
00:21:49,046 --> 00:21:56,611
Scott: bring it because the pain of that is not as bad as the pain of having to pay Some asshole a bunch of money or whatever they want.

313
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:57,335
Scott: Interestingly.

314
00:21:57,355 --> 00:22:00,647
Scott: I've learned recently Blackmailing you for like a dollar, right?

315
00:22:00,888 --> 00:22:02,154
Scott: I guess that's always possible.

316
00:22:02,355 --> 00:22:03,600
Rym: I am not like Scott.

317
00:22:03,861 --> 00:22:06,391
Scott: Give me a dollar or else I'll set your house on fire.

318
00:22:06,431 --> 00:22:07,234
Scott: It's like here's a dollar.

319
00:22:07,254 --> 00:22:08,680
Rym: All right, we're good.

320
00:22:08,901 --> 00:22:12,912
Rym: Then I'm a racketeer, I guess I don't know but apparently it is.

321
00:22:13,453 --> 00:22:15,078
Rym: it is illegal to blackmail someone.

322
00:22:15,098 --> 00:22:21,363
Rym: Yeah, obviously Sort of but actually there's a lot of situations where depending on how it's framed It's not what.

323
00:22:21,564 --> 00:22:22,868
Scott: give me one of those situations.

324
00:22:23,289 --> 00:22:25,175
Scott: Oh, so I may execute upon it.

325
00:22:25,215 --> 00:22:26,900
Scott: So here's why I know many things.

326
00:22:26,981 --> 00:22:30,124
Rym: It is not illegal to pay Blackmail money.

327
00:22:30,264 --> 00:22:30,966
Scott: No, of course not.

328
00:22:31,327 --> 00:22:37,524
Rym: So if someone just says hey, I have all these really embarrassing photos of you I found isn't that funny?

329
00:22:37,544 --> 00:22:45,310
Rym: and he doesn't directly threaten you and you separately say hey Here's the keys to my this condo that I own.

330
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:48,100
Rym: use it whenever you want to pay that blackmail.

331
00:22:49,062 --> 00:22:52,496
Rym: You probably couldn't actually take any legal action against those people.

332
00:22:52,516 --> 00:22:55,782
Rym: Nope so Really?

333
00:22:55,802 --> 00:23:02,520
Rym: It appears that it's easy to blackmail people in such a way that it would be very hard to prosecute you for blackmailing them.

334
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:07,576
Rym: Mmm now I'm just thinking about that Monty Python skin the blackmail show.

335
00:23:08,525 --> 00:23:10,400
Rym: I'll link to that as a secondary thing at the day, right?

336
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:17,129
Scott: But if you don't suggest like let's say I have a website I put it up with a bunch of embarrassing photos of Rym and It has a password so no one can get to it.

337
00:23:17,189 --> 00:23:20,940
Scott: and I send Rym like hey check out this website And I send you the URL and the password.

338
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,932
Scott: Yeah, all I say is hey check out this website you check it out.

339
00:23:24,494 --> 00:23:24,855
Scott: You go.

340
00:23:24,876 --> 00:23:25,940
Scott: Oh, oh shit.

341
00:23:26,781 --> 00:23:28,148
Scott: And but you see there's a password on it.

342
00:23:28,529 --> 00:23:29,614
Scott: I haven't said anything else.

343
00:23:29,695 --> 00:23:30,820
Scott: I can't say anything else.

344
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,097
Scott: I can't say pay me money or I can't write up.

345
00:23:33,781 --> 00:23:35,928
Scott: How do you get the hint that you're gonna have to be?

346
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:37,413
Scott: you just don't realize.

347
00:23:37,454 --> 00:23:39,280
Scott: you just think oh shit Scott's gonna reveal.

348
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,483
Rym: Well, see you think that it.

349
00:23:41,085 --> 00:23:42,127
Rym: this comes down to.

350
00:23:42,428 --> 00:23:47,120
Rym: how naive are you and how dumb is the blackmailer right?

351
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:53,039
Rym: This is like that burning wheel game where we failed our write test and then our cohort failed their read test.

352
00:23:56,702 --> 00:23:57,466
Rym: So one other news.

353
00:23:57,486 --> 00:24:00,299
Rym: I'm not gonna talk about the lot but this is so amazingly cool.

354
00:24:01,901 --> 00:24:13,552
Rym: So there's in the culture books There's the neural net mesh Which is like this technology where you basically put this like net this mesh inside of your brain And then it's like an awesome machine interface.

355
00:24:13,572 --> 00:24:15,159
Rym: It's like a cyber brain and ghost in the shell.

356
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:35,220
Rym: That technology is actually kind of real and there have been some big breakthroughs in it recently and they're injecting with needles Meshes into the brains of rats in a manner that not only does not kill them But allows the brain to be sort of analyzed on a level we've never been able to analyze a working brain before.

357
00:24:35,521 --> 00:24:38,448
Rym: Okay, this stuff is so cool.

358
00:24:38,648 --> 00:24:40,793
Scott: Just another step towards our ghost in the shell future.

359
00:24:40,954 --> 00:24:51,999
Rym: Yes, and also the article is Terrifying to read just by the nature of what and how what they're doing and how they're doing it.

360
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:55,932
Rym: And it's phrased in this very sort of neutral language.

361
00:24:56,434 --> 00:25:11,760
Rym: but reading between the lines Horrifying death is a common failure condition in this kind of research things of the day.

362
00:25:12,571 --> 00:25:13,179
Rym: There's this thing.

363
00:25:13,662 --> 00:25:22,013
Rym: I actually encountered a very similar thing way back when I worked at IBM because that IBM in This one facility at IBM and this one department at IBM this one part of IBM.

364
00:25:22,033 --> 00:25:24,200
Rym: I won't say what part there.

365
00:25:24,903 --> 00:25:26,571
Rym: Some DNS servers that are pretty important.

366
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:28,459
Rym: They're like the root DNS servers for this stuff.

367
00:25:28,922 --> 00:25:31,417
Scott: I did the root DNS servers for IBM com.

368
00:25:31,619 --> 00:25:36,623
Rym: No So they also post some other services Like.

369
00:25:36,663 --> 00:25:38,168
Rym: I think there's some.

370
00:25:38,188 --> 00:25:40,876
Scott: are these ancient IBM mainframes like with COBOL and shit.

371
00:25:40,936 --> 00:25:42,000
Rym: No, no, nothing like that.

372
00:25:42,362 --> 00:25:53,900
Rym: So I think there's some socks and spinning tape wheels God Do you even remember or know what socks is as an HTTP proxy kind of thing sort of yeah Yeah, so it's got some bunch of services running like old ass services.

373
00:25:55,685 --> 00:25:57,059
Rym: It was some OS 2 warp machines.

374
00:25:57,553 --> 00:26:01,358
Scott: Oh, yeah It's an IBM thing that hadn't been powered off since before.

375
00:26:01,478 --> 00:26:05,852
Scott: I saw Warp was the weird one that you got on like your home system.

376
00:26:06,293 --> 00:26:08,360
Scott: That also was Windows 3.1.

377
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,760
Scott: I thought that other the real servers used just like OS 2 not OS 2.

378
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,060
Rym: Well, this was always to warp and actually it had been updated periodically.

379
00:26:16,161 --> 00:26:19,739
Rym: So it was a version of that that never made it outside of IBM.

380
00:26:20,001 --> 00:26:22,037
Rym: It was like a real like they kept using it.

381
00:26:22,057 --> 00:26:23,906
Scott: development Wonder if you can run it in VirtualBox.

382
00:26:24,427 --> 00:26:24,869
Rym: I have it.

383
00:26:25,592 --> 00:26:27,800
Rym: I have the full install and documentation for it.

384
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,329
Rym: It was a parting gift when I left IBM.

385
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:29,812
Scott: Nice.

386
00:26:29,832 --> 00:26:31,882
Scott: Let's try to run it in VirtualBox We should.

387
00:26:31,902 --> 00:26:34,130
Rym: I got it on a bunch of CDs and shit, huh?

388
00:26:35,174 --> 00:26:36,599
Scott: I guess you probably have to run in box.

389
00:26:37,101 --> 00:26:38,867
Rym: Yeah, you'd have to run it on like a hardware.

390
00:26:38,887 --> 00:26:42,780
Rym: It's an x86 and that shit's not gonna just work in like VMware.

391
00:26:43,941 --> 00:26:51,160
Rym: Bo CHS is an x86 emulator But anyway, so this thing was never really powered off or anything and just kept working.

392
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:55,160
Rym: Everyone's terrified of turning it off because they were afraid, you know, what would happen if it doesn't turn back?

393
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:55,945
Scott: Yeah, this thing had.

394
00:26:55,965 --> 00:26:58,540
Scott: we haven't run the boot sequence on this in a long time.

395
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,785
Scott: We don't even know if it works.

396
00:26:59,845 --> 00:27:03,380
Scott: like for all we know I worry about that on servers that have been running for like a year.

397
00:27:03,441 --> 00:27:04,431
Scott: It's like wow this reboots.

398
00:27:04,471 --> 00:27:05,279
Scott: Will it turn back on?

399
00:27:05,901 --> 00:27:12,262
Rym: Or even like what if a hard drive failed in such a way that it just won't spin back up and in old Mechanically.

400
00:27:12,322 --> 00:27:13,931
Rym: Yeah, or even like in old computers.

401
00:27:14,514 --> 00:27:19,738
Rym: It could be running out of RAM That hard drive might be empty depending on how it's set up like old OSes.

402
00:27:20,381 --> 00:27:24,415
Rym: You could run shit in weird ways that you wouldn't even dream of in the modern era.

403
00:27:24,435 --> 00:27:25,700
Scott: Yeah, what if this has like a RAM disk?

404
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,838
Rym: Yeah, what if there's a RAM disk and like oops?

405
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,694
Rym: So this is a story that's public of a similar thing.

406
00:27:32,775 --> 00:27:35,926
Rym: a computer from the 80s I think it's like a Commodore machine or something.

407
00:27:36,067 --> 00:27:51,359
Rym: Yeah, I think it's an Amiga or something like that has been controlling all the HVAC So like the heating and cooling and boilers and everything as opposed to say a thermostat for 19 school buildings in this area Via this like crazy wireless network.

408
00:27:51,774 --> 00:28:17,200
Scott: Yeah Basically, they all the like the temperature sensors and all the buildings will radio over to this computer with a radio right like Radio What the temperature is and then the computer will decide whether to turn the heat or air conditioning on or off And it will send a radio signal back to the school That's in a different building across town and tell it turn your heat on turn your air conditioning on quote.

409
00:28:17,361 --> 00:28:21,300
Rym: Whenever the district has a problem with it, they go back to the original programmer who still lives in the area.

410
00:28:21,641 --> 00:28:23,085
Rym: It's a very unique product.

411
00:28:23,366 --> 00:28:24,630
Rym: It operates on a 1200 bit modem.

412
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:26,275
Rym: I guess I guess 1200 baud.

413
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,726
Scott: I'm pretty sure it's baud.

414
00:28:28,947 --> 00:28:35,558
Rym: Well baud, you know what the difference is from a baud and a bit Bit and something something.

415
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,330
Rym: No, no, no, no, I'll save that I'm making.

416
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:40,057
Rym: I'm gonna make that a thing of the day separately.

417
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:40,820
Scott: what baud is?

418
00:28:41,041 --> 00:28:45,400
Rym: Yeah, cuz baud stopped being relevant when we jumped from 90.

419
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,328
Rym: I think 9600 baud was the last time.

420
00:28:47,368 --> 00:28:52,909
Scott: baud meant right but like a 9600 baud modem sent over 9.6 kilobits per second.

421
00:28:53,009 --> 00:28:54,234
Rym: Was it bits or characters?

422
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,422
Scott: I Thought it was bits.

423
00:28:56,623 --> 00:28:59,211
Rym: Yeah, I'll link to an article about it.

424
00:28:59,351 --> 00:29:00,113
Scott: If it's characters.

425
00:29:00,134 --> 00:29:00,976
Scott: That's way more bits.

426
00:29:00,996 --> 00:29:02,220
Scott: It's eight times as many bits.

427
00:29:03,523 --> 00:29:07,820
Rym: so, uh this thing Needs to be replaced obviously.

428
00:29:09,301 --> 00:29:17,688
Rym: And this article kind of talks about why it's gonna cost a hundred one point five to two million dollars each Building control its own heating and cooling.

429
00:29:17,708 --> 00:29:19,373
Scott: Yeah, they really that complicated.

430
00:29:19,393 --> 00:29:21,880
Scott: You don't need new heating machines or new cooling machines.

431
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,720
Scott: They'll seem to be working.

432
00:29:22,901 --> 00:29:25,890
Rym: It's not just turning on and off from what I can gather because it's controlling.

433
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:30,291
Rym: it's not kind of these asshole boilers and like all There's complicated stuff.

434
00:29:31,219 --> 00:29:35,740
Scott: Oh And basically I think part of the cause my school student was able to write a program to control it.

435
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:38,799
Rym: I don't know over the high school soon, but part of the he was a high school student when he wrote it.

436
00:29:39,061 --> 00:29:43,100
Rym: I think part of the cost is someone's got to go and like really figure out exactly what it's doing.

437
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:49,480
Rym: But I'll bet I could do this project For half that money where I could do this project in like a weekend.

438
00:29:49,745 --> 00:29:55,544
Scott: Well, no I would give you sent me the source code just for that thing to study it for a little while and I'll run it in A little emulator.

439
00:29:56,167 --> 00:29:57,855
Scott: I could replace that shit so fast.

440
00:29:57,936 --> 00:29:58,599
Rym: I would go different.

441
00:29:58,619 --> 00:30:06,040
Scott: tack You know, I'd put like one Raspberry Pi in each school connected to an Arduino that we're drilling the relays or whatever the physical.

442
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,080
Scott: You don't even need the Arduino.

443
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:11,076
Scott: You just put one Raspberry Pi in each school and like a one backup Raspberry Pi next to it.

444
00:30:11,116 --> 00:30:12,120
Scott: cuz why the fuck not?

445
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,969
Scott: So it's like I'm into the wall with a battery back back up.

446
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:15,391
Scott: So he's got.

447
00:30:15,431 --> 00:30:17,760
Rym: how does it like control the boiler then?

448
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:21,069
Scott: Whatever wires there's definitely a device.

449
00:30:21,269 --> 00:30:24,260
Scott: Yeah connecting that radio to the boilers that exists.

450
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:31,084
Scott: Now I figure out what protocol is going on between the radio and the boilers and I implement that.

451
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:34,040
Rym: in the side might be a bunch of like high voltage relays.

452
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,425
Rym: It might be like some fucked up.

453
00:30:35,545 --> 00:30:39,820
Scott: and those relays those relays are there at the connection point with the radio?

454
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:47,988
Scott: There is an analog signal going to the radio and I can connect to it the Raspberry Pi at that point with Worst case like an ADC or whatever.

455
00:30:48,088 --> 00:30:51,318
Scott: Yeah, so you got a thing of the day.

456
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:57,207
Scott: Oh sure So the camera that I have is the very fancy Panasonic gh4.

457
00:30:57,388 --> 00:30:58,474
Scott: it is a fancy camera.

458
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:03,540
Scott: It is Expensive as most people would see it at the price of seventeen hundred dollars.

459
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,020
Scott: You can get it for less like twelve hundred or used or refurbished or whatever.

460
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:15,320
Scott: Yeah, the magic of it is that it can take 4k video Which is insane for like a camera with interchangeable lenses and all right.

461
00:31:15,822 --> 00:31:21,000
Scott: It is crazy good at video and also pretty great damn good at photo and whatnot.

462
00:31:21,161 --> 00:31:28,126
Scott: So it is a very popular camera, but you know, you might think that's a lot of money But really it's not actually that much money.

463
00:31:28,166 --> 00:31:43,177
Scott: as far as cameras are concerned the Canon 5d mark 3 which is like the standard For digital cameras that have a sensor the size of one You know size of 35 millimeter film full-frame is like almost three thousand dollars.

464
00:31:43,217 --> 00:31:44,240
Scott: ridiculous, right?

465
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:50,940
Scott: It's and it's way big and it only takes 1080p video and whatever but it's still a very popular video camera regardless.

466
00:31:51,312 --> 00:31:59,021
Scott: anyway some guy had that camera the same one as me and he attached it to the Fujinon X a 55 lens.

467
00:32:01,487 --> 00:32:03,200
Scott: See the thing with a mirrorless camera.

468
00:32:03,402 --> 00:32:12,042
Scott: See the Canon camera has a mirror in it Which means the distance between the sensor or the film the digital film and the lens is a big distance because you have to put A mirror.

469
00:32:12,102 --> 00:32:23,760
Scott: in between that space the mirrorless camera There is less space Which means you can use a lens designed for a camera where there's more space just by basically sticking a tube on there.

470
00:32:24,502 --> 00:32:28,596
Scott: Right because it's like oh this lens is designed to be two inches away from the film.

471
00:32:28,938 --> 00:32:32,620
Scott: this camera The mount is like half an inch away from the film.

472
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:39,085
Scott: So we'll just put a one and a half inch disc in between and then we can attach this old-ass lens To this brand new camera.

473
00:32:39,828 --> 00:32:43,400
Scott: And so that is the magic of the mirrorless gh4 and other mirrorless cameras.

474
00:32:43,481 --> 00:32:49,228
Scott: So the Fujinon X a 55 lens is One of those lenses made for a TV camera.

475
00:32:49,248 --> 00:32:56,140
Scott: like you ever watch sports and you see those guys in the sidelines Well, you think it's a giant can have this giant camera, right?

476
00:32:56,260 --> 00:33:00,540
Scott: Like the guy at the football game on the sideline who's like in the little like the lift, right?

477
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,124
Scott: And he said this giant camera.

478
00:33:02,144 --> 00:33:04,751
Scott: It looks like a big box basically, right?

479
00:33:05,313 --> 00:33:08,925
Scott: You realize that the box is the lens Everything else.

480
00:33:09,006 --> 00:33:11,019
Scott: the camera behind it is very very small.

481
00:33:11,782 --> 00:33:16,899
Scott: The box is the lens and those lenses that are odd that they use for television live sports and things.

482
00:33:17,643 --> 00:33:20,500
Scott: First of all, they're that big because they're amazing.

483
00:33:21,883 --> 00:33:30,274
Scott: They're also I don't know at least Usually I've seen him go depending on which one you get like hundreds of thousands of dollars.

484
00:33:30,695 --> 00:33:32,542
Scott: I've seen some for 300,000.

485
00:33:32,542 --> 00:33:45,870
Scott: They're really really expensive Right, so this guy he takes my camera $1,700 and attaches it to this $60,000 lens by way of adapting as I just described.

486
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:51,120
Scott: and When you combine the fact that this lens is already insane to begin with, right?

487
00:33:51,220 --> 00:34:04,657
Scott: It's a nine point five to five twenty five millimeter lens Which means it can zoom way in way way in more than pretty much any lens that you have at home Zoom way out probably farther out almost as far out as any lens I have.

488
00:34:04,738 --> 00:34:11,275
Scott: actually I think you know It zooms farther out than any lens I have also and It's one point one sevens.

489
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,627
Scott: So we can let you.

490
00:34:13,647 --> 00:34:19,478
Scott: basically you can open the aperture a ton and let tons of light in So you can shoot in way dark conditions.

491
00:34:20,803 --> 00:34:29,411
Scott: He puts a 2x extender on it So that basically makes it zoom in twice as much and is also sort of necessary for attaching it to this tiny camera That wasn't designed for it.

492
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:39,280
Scott: and then in addition to that you have to realize the sensor on this camera is Like half the size of you know, a 35 millimeter sensor.

493
00:34:39,781 --> 00:34:45,800
Scott: So when you're basically cropping into the middle of the picture, which is sort of the same thing as zooming in, right?

494
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:54,309
Scott: I mean if I take a picture and I just crop out the middle part and then I put that next to it It's like oh it looks like you zoomed in which sort of did.

495
00:34:54,329 --> 00:35:04,005
Scott: Yeah, so it comes out to be a 45 to 2415 millimeter 415 millimeter equivalent.

496
00:35:04,226 --> 00:35:17,543
Scott: now if that doesn't mean anything and that doesn't mean anything to you watch my thing of the day Which is a video and you can see the ridiculousness when he zoomed in on that lighthouse Wait to which he can zoom with this 60. that I mean you got what you pay for $60,000 lens, right?

497
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:26,131
Scott: But this is why they use these for television because basically you can any situation No matter what the light is no matter how much you had to zoom.

498
00:35:26,573 --> 00:35:28,180
Scott: you can get the shot with these lenses.

499
00:35:29,141 --> 00:35:33,056
Scott: Right, you need to get the whole football field or a player's close-up face.

500
00:35:33,096 --> 00:35:36,643
Scott: You're gonna be able to get it done No problem In a moment.

501
00:35:36,703 --> 00:35:39,232
Rym: the book club book is the wheel of time.

502
00:35:39,252 --> 00:35:42,607
Rym: Eye of the world The first one.

503
00:35:42,647 --> 00:35:43,190
Rym: I got to read it.

504
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:43,975
Rym: I'll start reading it.

505
00:35:43,995 --> 00:35:46,020
Rym: I'm going to London this week So I'll read it on the plane.

506
00:35:46,442 --> 00:35:46,783
Scott: I haven't.

507
00:35:46,984 --> 00:35:51,915
Scott: I read it and then I stopped reading it for a little bit because I'm busy but every time I see it there I actually kind of want to read it.

508
00:35:52,279 --> 00:35:55,551
Scott: Oh Interesting more so than the rabbit book at least.

509
00:35:55,571 --> 00:35:56,916
Rym: I like the rabbit book a lot.

510
00:35:56,956 --> 00:35:57,920
Scott: I don't hate the rabbit book.

511
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,965
Scott: I just didn't want to.

512
00:35:58,985 --> 00:36:02,120
Rym: I just don't know if I'm feeling generic fantasy because I almost want to read.

513
00:36:02,682 --> 00:36:05,089
Rym: Some of those forgot it at Elms books again instead.

514
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:06,815
Scott: So this is hopefully better than this.

515
00:36:07,116 --> 00:36:07,677
Scott: We'll see.

516
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:08,480
Rym: I'm curious.

517
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,347
Scott: It's while it's generic fantasy.

518
00:36:11,407 --> 00:36:12,251
Scott: I think it's slightly.

519
00:36:12,291 --> 00:36:13,115
Scott: it's not highbrow.

520
00:36:13,135 --> 00:36:14,280
Scott: I think it's mid brow.

521
00:36:15,061 --> 00:36:17,428
Scott: So it's not lowbrow like your dragon lance.

522
00:36:17,669 --> 00:36:19,033
Rym: We're like fuck dragon lance.

523
00:36:19,614 --> 00:36:20,758
Scott: So say it's mid brow.

524
00:36:20,918 --> 00:36:23,849
Rym: So we Were catching up with a video queue.

525
00:36:23,929 --> 00:36:26,138
Rym: So upload it to our site on YouTube.

526
00:36:26,178 --> 00:36:36,390
Rym: now our Two videos a short excerpt from our bad games lecture at Santa and at peck south in San Antonio where we shit all over race walking for the garbage.

527
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:38,096
Rym: bullshit not a sports sport that it is.

528
00:36:38,116 --> 00:36:40,089
Rym: and Then the whole lecture.

529
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:40,796
Rym: because why not?

530
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:48,803
Scott: Also this Saturday I mentioned already but whatever I'm gonna lie attempt to live stream the Philadelphia regional 25th.

531
00:36:48,843 --> 00:36:57,078
Scott: I don't know what order to put these words in the 2015 Philadelphia netrunner regional championship Philadelphia regional 2015 netrunner championship.

532
00:36:57,118 --> 00:36:59,372
Scott: Yeah, I don't know How do you put those words in the right order?

533
00:36:59,473 --> 00:37:00,359
Scott: Someone help me out with that?

534
00:37:02,021 --> 00:37:02,925
Scott: But anyway, you can watch.

535
00:37:02,985 --> 00:37:04,591
Scott: I'm gonna live stream that shit if I can.

536
00:37:05,033 --> 00:37:12,020
Rym: and July 9th 10th 11th and 12th Connecticut on 2015 and the 9th is only like get your badge because they don't mail the badges.

537
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:15,231
Rym: yet The only bad thing about Connecticut and it's like there's.

538
00:37:15,251 --> 00:37:22,680
Scott: there's a couple events at night that don't really count Repanels and the nerd prom and a bunch of people just hang out like a nerd prom requires separate tickets.

539
00:37:23,225 --> 00:37:23,628
Rym: I don't know.

540
00:37:23,669 --> 00:37:24,092
Rym: I think so.

541
00:37:24,113 --> 00:37:24,839
Scott: I think it does.

542
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,729
Scott: I've never was different registration at least.

543
00:37:26,769 --> 00:37:28,860
Rym: despite running the panels department for many many years.

544
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,510
Rym: I've never been there Thursday night - we're not really into the nerd.

545
00:37:31,831 --> 00:37:34,180
Rym: find out I would have if I was 17.

546
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,628
Rym: I'd be so into that nerd prom.

547
00:37:35,969 --> 00:37:40,863
Rym: Maybe yeah, I know I would have been anyway I know what I was like when I was 17.

548
00:37:40,863 --> 00:37:43,485
Rym: So, uh, yeah Talking about the sneaker net.

549
00:37:43,565 --> 00:37:47,120
Rym: so Cuba opening up and there's a fascinating article in the link to here.

550
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:51,515
Rym: But basically it's a report on El Paquette day or El Paquette.

551
00:37:51,916 --> 00:37:55,653
Rym: Okay the package Mmm, it's just called the package.

552
00:37:55,733 --> 00:37:58,285
Rym: I'll read this excerpt for you Cuba's answer.

553
00:37:58,325 --> 00:38:12,278
Rym: I'm quoting Cuba's answer to the internet an informal but extraordinarily Lucrative distribution chain where anyone in Cuba who can who can pay can watch telenovelas first run Hollywood movies Search for romantic partners, etc.

554
00:38:13,063 --> 00:38:21,680
Rym: The so-called weekly package distributed a house to house I guess on USB sticks contains a bunch of movies and TV shows and documentaries.

555
00:38:21,881 --> 00:38:27,378
Scott: So there's one there's one person with internet who downloads all this shit onto USB like pirates a terabyte.

556
00:38:27,398 --> 00:38:29,567
Scott: where the shit Where does this person get their internet from?

557
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:30,912
Scott: that fills up these USB sticks?

558
00:38:31,354 --> 00:38:32,158
Rym: Uh, I don't know.

559
00:38:32,198 --> 00:38:32,720
Rym: read the article.

560
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,210
Scott: Where did they get all these USB sticks from?

561
00:38:34,552 --> 00:38:34,935
Rym: well Scott?

562
00:38:34,995 --> 00:38:35,660
Rym: Wait, where did you get it?

563
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:41,598
Rym: I could if my job was hang out on Pirate Bay and assemble the package.

564
00:38:41,658 --> 00:38:44,150
Rym: every week I can make one fucking amazing package.

565
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:46,260
Scott: I can make it amazing fucking package as well.

566
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:51,020
Scott: But how do I get that package on to so many USB sticks and up for all the nerds in Cuba?

567
00:38:51,642 --> 00:38:53,300
Rym: So it's sort of this ad-hoc network.

568
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:58,603
Rym: We're like one gets made and I guess once you've got one and you can churn out a bunch of them just copy them Right, and how do I have?

569
00:38:58,683 --> 00:39:02,940
Scott: one guy in the neighborhood gets El Paquette day and everyone else copies it and doesn't pay.

570
00:39:03,281 --> 00:39:06,720
Rym: Yep, so read the article and it goes into the details of how this works.

571
00:39:07,082 --> 00:39:12,368
Rym: But apparently it's you get a terabyte a week For ten bucks.

572
00:39:12,609 --> 00:39:13,734
Scott: Oh, holy shit.

573
00:39:13,774 --> 00:39:14,900
Scott: They're downloading a lot.

574
00:39:15,513 --> 00:39:18,828
Rym: Yeah Wow There is there is everything here.

575
00:39:18,868 --> 00:39:23,000
Rym: another quote the thumb drives make their way across the island from how are the hair bite?

576
00:39:23,421 --> 00:39:24,753
Scott: Usb sticks what the fuck.

577
00:39:24,874 --> 00:39:25,480
Rym: hand-to-hand?

578
00:39:27,805 --> 00:39:29,350
Rym: Might be for smaller USB.

579
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:33,300
Scott: Are you sure it's not just like a hard drive a magnetic one?

580
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:40,448
Rym: that'd be fine just at this point like yeah, but this is Fascinating to say the least.

581
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:43,140
Rym: Yeah, it shows the power of human ingenuity.

582
00:39:43,602 --> 00:39:47,840
Scott: Also, that's a lot faster download speeds than I got, you know, let me take to download a terabyte of movies.

583
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:57,913
Rym: So one this is amazing because what if subverts, you know the worldwide like copyright Can I pay ten bucks and get up a ketate delivered to me?

584
00:39:57,993 --> 00:39:58,496
Scott: Oh my god.

585
00:39:58,536 --> 00:39:59,260
Rym: I want El Paquette.

586
00:39:59,543 --> 00:40:00,579
Scott: I'll take ten bucks for that.

587
00:40:00,841 --> 00:40:10,830
Rym: yeah, but to like this was also subversive in Cuba because For all the stuff the NSA does This is the kind of network.

588
00:40:11,231 --> 00:40:13,160
Rym: That is the hardest to bust up.

589
00:40:13,481 --> 00:40:18,257
Rym: Oh, yeah way more useful than complicated encrypted mesh networks.

590
00:40:18,297 --> 00:40:19,220
Scott: Nothing to spy on.

591
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:28,620
Scott: It's like imagine if people aren't using the post office and you know, there's no third party There's no central point where the communication passes through that you can sit and look at all the things that are happening.

592
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:34,160
Rym: It's just one guy hands a thing to another guy and then that guy copies and gives it to ten friends.

593
00:40:35,565 --> 00:40:36,568
Scott: Are not you beside?

594
00:40:36,628 --> 00:40:37,070
Scott: you can you?

595
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:40,240
Scott: it's like look out the window and see who's handing who what see?

596
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:43,779
Scott: Okay, I saw that those two people exchanged something.

597
00:40:44,981 --> 00:40:49,480
Scott: You go down and find out I was letting him borrow my screwdriver.

598
00:40:49,942 --> 00:40:55,742
Scott: It I've you know, hey, it's like you can't be doing every time people trade something It's like.

599
00:40:55,803 --> 00:40:58,800
Scott: and how can you see every time people do anything in public?

600
00:40:59,343 --> 00:41:02,139
Scott: All right, just more important changing goods and services like.

601
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:05,360
Rym: yeah We can use like waste to like networks and like really all the stuff.

602
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,093
Scott: Guy brings his car to the mechanic to get it fixed.

603
00:41:08,475 --> 00:41:09,500
Scott: He leaves the mechanic.

604
00:41:10,064 --> 00:41:12,220
Scott: Oh, the glove box is filled with USB sticks.

605
00:41:12,265 --> 00:41:20,460
Rym: Yeah You had no idea but he's supposed to know all the complicated ways We've talked about to like really subvert governments and like so share information.

606
00:41:21,124 --> 00:41:22,391
Rym: They all rely on a couple things.

607
00:41:22,411 --> 00:41:31,939
Rym: they rely on you still having electricity The internet still being there and in terms of like even ad hoc encrypted mesh networks The EMP isn't things gonna stick that out.

608
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:38,300
Scott: But if you send data over anything that's wireless ever someone who's near enough can spy on that.

609
00:41:38,562 --> 00:41:39,659
Scott: So I might be encrypted maybe.

610
00:41:40,661 --> 00:41:43,690
Rym: But signal intelligence can figure out where the broadcasts are.

611
00:41:44,051 --> 00:41:50,634
Rym: and even if they can't figure it out because it's a really complicated cool Or you have a really long wire between your home base and your antenna.

612
00:41:50,754 --> 00:41:51,839
Rym: They can just jam it.

613
00:41:52,702 --> 00:41:54,588
Rym: Any wireless signal can be jammed.

614
00:41:54,628 --> 00:42:00,671
Scott: Yeah jamming is way easier than doing and any wired signal Can be cut obviously.

615
00:42:00,932 --> 00:42:02,340
Scott: or hey, what's this passes?

616
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:07,216
Scott: Yeah, if it passes through any point that is not you and its destination.

617
00:42:07,317 --> 00:42:08,220
Scott: It can be spied upon.

618
00:42:08,782 --> 00:42:21,757
Rym: So the sneaker nets are like the sneaker net is the term for when you exchange information in Person or via physical artifacts as in you are using your sneakers your shoes as a network.

619
00:42:21,797 --> 00:42:21,938
Rym: to

620
00:42:21,978 --> 00:42:26,088
Scott: deliver the data I take a floppy disk I walk over to rims house and I give it to him

621
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:37,520
Rym: and this is like this is used for real Stuff like as I linked you in this article Sometimes mailing a truck like a truck full our drives is way faster than any other option.

622
00:42:37,861 --> 00:42:39,146
Scott: Yeah, I mean think about how.

623
00:42:39,227 --> 00:42:42,440
Scott: you know, you have gigabit connection to the internet 10 gigabit connection to the internet.

624
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:44,406
Scott: All right, how fast is that?

625
00:42:44,907 --> 00:42:48,538
Scott: Can that beat me mailing a 4 terabyte hard drive in the mail?

626
00:42:48,838 --> 00:42:49,320
Rym: What about me?

627
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:52,291
Scott: What if I do overnight Express Mail?

628
00:42:52,332 --> 00:42:54,360
Scott: What if I do a bike courier across the city?

629
00:42:54,600 --> 00:43:00,338
Rym: What if I get a u-haul and literally fill it to the brim with 4 terabyte disks?

630
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:10,563
Rym: Yep Wow, what if you made a truck that was dedicated like it's my skull the drivers mounted in it and just has like a port On the outside to connect and fill it with data like gas Mm-hmm.

631
00:43:11,326 --> 00:43:14,557
Rym: So, uh this stuff this is an aspect of technology.

632
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:26,895
Rym: computing Anonymous speech data distribution sneaker nets touch on Way more parts of technology in the internet in the world than you'd think they're still useful even today.

633
00:43:27,015 --> 00:43:34,540
Rym: and they are used today both by Shall we say illicit actors and just by like Google and the government?

634
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:38,616
Scott: Well, I mean in the olden days they were super popular because it was sort of your only method.

635
00:43:38,857 --> 00:43:40,583
Scott: right a modem Was not good.

636
00:43:40,744 --> 00:43:45,860
Rym: Yeah, like if I wanted to download where's from the local BBS one that took a while.

637
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:52,079
Scott: You didn't get doom pirated by downloading it You got doom because someone had the wad files put them on a floppy disk and gave them to you.

638
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:52,903
Rym: Yep, and you'd have.

639
00:43:53,244 --> 00:43:57,760
Rym: I had this floppy disk that had scorched earth on it the unlocked version.

640
00:43:58,424 --> 00:44:00,880
Rym: Good God, did that floppy disk get copied?

641
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,084
Rym: Basically around the world.

642
00:44:03,164 --> 00:44:07,720
Scott: Yeah, everyone in school right keeps trading files between all their floppy disks, right?

643
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:09,165
Scott: That was sneaker net.

644
00:44:09,225 --> 00:44:13,520
Rym: every I've got a copy of scorched earth and la la checks on a floppy disk once.

645
00:44:14,061 --> 00:44:22,379
Rym: And we're like when I was in like high school and it had some of the shit from the same disk I'd seen in a different school district in middle school.

646
00:44:22,741 --> 00:44:28,822
Rym: Yeah, like data just starts to accumulate on that rolling stone moss grows all over a rolling USB stick All right.

647
00:44:28,862 --> 00:44:29,344
Scott: Well you is.

648
00:44:29,364 --> 00:44:33,022
Scott: best thing is nowadays, you know, the floppy disk, you know It's not.

649
00:44:33,385 --> 00:44:35,860
Scott: people aren't doing it as much because it's no longer necessary.

650
00:44:35,961 --> 00:44:37,579
Scott: You can just download and trade over the net.

651
00:44:38,121 --> 00:44:46,820
Scott: But the USB stick that is such high capacity in such small space makes it more powerful when you do use it Yep, and you can do crazy stuff.

652
00:44:47,081 --> 00:44:51,800
Scott: You can leave a USB stick out in public somewhere and someone can pick it up because it's so small.

653
00:44:52,141 --> 00:45:01,271
Scott: People are like sticking USB sticks in walls with the USB port sticking up and if you get a little cable or stub your laptop Up against the wall, you can get the data on there or leave data off.

654
00:45:01,452 --> 00:45:02,015
Scott: So think about this.

655
00:45:02,075 --> 00:45:03,340
Rym: Hey, what's this USB stick?

656
00:45:03,761 --> 00:45:07,072
Rym: Oh, it's a whole bunch of government anti-corruption stuff, huh?

657
00:45:07,333 --> 00:45:08,437
Scott: Oh, it's a bunch of viruses.

658
00:45:08,457 --> 00:45:09,440
Scott: It just grew in my computer.

659
00:45:09,501 --> 00:45:11,080
Rym: Yeah, that did you see the dude?

660
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:17,236
Rym: He made a proof of concept a USB stick that will physically destroy any computer.

661
00:45:17,277 --> 00:45:18,420
Rym: you plug it into nice.

662
00:45:19,142 --> 00:45:20,045
Rym: It's pretty complicated.

663
00:45:20,065 --> 00:45:20,807
Rym: how it does it like.

664
00:45:20,847 --> 00:45:25,080
Rym: it's way harder to do that than you'd think but any computer Mac PC doesn't matter.

665
00:45:25,261 --> 00:45:30,987
Scott: Yeah, it hardware ruins it even if I use a hub Through a hub.

666
00:45:31,008 --> 00:45:35,325
Rym: I might just destroy the hub maybe Mmm, it's interesting.

667
00:45:35,345 --> 00:45:36,910
Rym: Yeah, it's it's a complicated thing.

668
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:38,535
Scott: I'll find Howard hub non-powered.

669
00:45:38,756 --> 00:45:39,860
Rym: I'll find the article.

670
00:45:40,182 --> 00:45:44,827
Rym: Let me make a note on this third monitor To remember to.

671
00:45:44,927 --> 00:45:47,234
Rym: I'll link to this in the forum because I don't remember the detail.

672
00:45:47,254 --> 00:45:47,795
Rym: Mm-hmm.

673
00:45:49,521 --> 00:45:52,620
Scott: Yeah, the increased capacity makes it, you know so much more powerful.

674
00:45:52,721 --> 00:45:56,420
Scott: The other things you can do is you can sort of have half sneaker net, right?

675
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,559
Scott: We talked about pirate box way back in the day.

676
00:45:59,001 --> 00:46:01,630
Scott: You can make like a physical thing that you carry around.

677
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:03,094
Scott: that has Wi-Fi.

678
00:46:03,114 --> 00:46:04,920
Scott: so you it's still wireless.

679
00:46:05,101 --> 00:46:08,778
Scott: It's still sort of has that bit of insecurity, but you have to be pretty close to it to get it.

680
00:46:09,361 --> 00:46:11,528
Scott: but then the power of it is so much greater.

681
00:46:11,589 --> 00:46:25,251
Scott: imagine if I just had a bunch of hard drives and some access points in a truck and I drove around town and parked in a few places according to like a schedule and like I hid my SS IDs that you had to know and see.

682
00:46:25,291 --> 00:46:26,937
Scott: the truck was there and be in the know.

683
00:46:27,017 --> 00:46:33,230
Rym: and then you log into This thing and it tells you the flash mob Information where to go to do the whatever crazy poor.

684
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:37,889
Scott: you log in and access the terabytes and terabytes of data in el Paquette day that is in my truck.

685
00:46:37,989 --> 00:46:39,620
Rym: Whoa, that gave me a great idea.

686
00:46:40,362 --> 00:46:41,719
Rym: That's the new pirate radio.

687
00:46:42,801 --> 00:46:44,611
Rym: That's the new party el paquette day.

688
00:46:45,074 --> 00:46:49,229
Rym: You just got to know Stand in like Madison Square Park.

689
00:46:49,289 --> 00:46:52,158
Scott: connect to this as his ID with this WPA password.

690
00:46:52,178 --> 00:46:53,587
Rym: at this time It's there between 1 p.m.

691
00:46:53,607 --> 00:46:56,846
Scott: And 2 p.m You have one hour a day.

692
00:46:56,866 --> 00:46:58,391
Scott: you can access all this data.

693
00:46:58,432 --> 00:47:00,860
Scott: that's just there at Wi-Fi speeds.

694
00:47:01,321 --> 00:47:04,370
Rym: Oh my god, that's actually an amazing idea.

695
00:47:04,531 --> 00:47:07,580
Scott: Then the security camera notices that this car shows up there every day.

696
00:47:07,981 --> 00:47:09,708
Rym: Yeah, but you do it like those night markets.

697
00:47:09,768 --> 00:47:10,953
Rym: Like you just have one.

698
00:47:10,973 --> 00:47:12,820
Rym: you have an underground distribution network.

699
00:47:13,081 --> 00:47:18,380
Scott: I think you're better off making it just put inside a lunchbox and you just physically go and sit in the park every day.

700
00:47:18,641 --> 00:47:20,369
Scott: Yeah, it's you know, who's gonna?

701
00:47:20,450 --> 00:47:22,480
Scott: Oh a guy has a routine of going to the park every day.

702
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:25,234
Rym: There's a lot of ways to do it.

703
00:47:25,294 --> 00:47:30,515
Rym: you could use Directional antennas and do it like from a rooftop point it at an area.

704
00:47:30,535 --> 00:47:31,820
Scott: Oh and turn it on and off.

705
00:47:31,961 --> 00:47:33,853
Rym: Yeah, there's a lot of cool there.

706
00:47:33,873 --> 00:47:34,859
Rym: There are ways to do this.

707
00:47:35,444 --> 00:47:36,029
Scott: There's many ways.

708
00:47:36,089 --> 00:47:40,931
Rym: do but the idea is that If you want there's a lot of things you might want to do where.

709
00:47:41,272 --> 00:47:52,999
Rym: putting that information on the internet publicly ruins that because people you don't want to see it can have access to it and Reveal what it is you're doing.

710
00:47:53,681 --> 00:48:04,395
Rym: sneaker net or I guess pirate Wi-Fi Localize the effect and it's like it's a security through obscurity like don't get me wrong But it's obscurity that's kind of hard to defeat.

711
00:48:04,998 --> 00:48:10,160
Scott: and you know Even at the beginning of the matrix the dude comes up to his door and with like trading floppy this, right?

712
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:13,196
Rym: Well, I mean never forget in hackers the famous line.

713
00:48:13,457 --> 00:48:16,974
Rym: Hey Remember that time that place I put that thing that one time.

714
00:48:17,397 --> 00:48:20,631
Rym: Yeah, I Still have some old friends.

715
00:48:20,692 --> 00:48:21,960
Rym: I still have some relationships like that.

716
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:31,072
Rym: There is in fact a place where I put that thing that one time and there's some people on this earth who know exactly Where that is probably in Michigan somewhere, maybe maybe not.

717
00:48:31,393 --> 00:48:33,380
Scott: pretty sure it is maybe maybe not.

718
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:36,731
Rym: Okay, I can say anything about it because it's kind of important.

719
00:48:36,791 --> 00:48:37,494
Rym: gives ever needed.

720
00:48:37,514 --> 00:48:38,116
Rym: Uh-huh.

721
00:48:38,216 --> 00:48:38,758
Rym: You never know.

722
00:48:38,778 --> 00:48:45,421
Rym: gun There's a gun hanging out there a dollar A D20.

723
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:54,100
Rym: this has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

724
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:58,880
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

725
00:48:59,201 --> 00:49:04,220
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at front row crew comm for show notes discussion news and more.

726
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:11,900
Rym: Remember GeekNights is not one but four different shows sci-tech Mondays gaming Tuesdays anime comic Wednesdays and indiscriminate Thursdays.

729
00:49:21,576 --> 00:49:22,860
Scott: It's actually recorded at night.
