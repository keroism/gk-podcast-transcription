00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,468
Rym: It's Wednesday, July 29th, 2015.

2
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:10,829
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,044 --> 00:00:14,539
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,180
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight.

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:23,280
Rym: We're talking about the old Vampire Hunter D OAV and Gundam The Origin, the manga.

6
00:00:25,772 --> 00:00:26,808
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:28,812 --> 00:00:32,689
Rym: So I said OAV instead of OVA and I was going to correct myself.

8
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:38,630
Rym: Like, oh right, because, you know, basically you can date an anime fan by if they say OAV or OVA.

9
00:00:39,073 --> 00:00:40,322
Rym: Because it used to be OAV and then...

10
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:42,670
Scott: I just interchange, I don't care anymore.

11
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,570
Scott: I don't even remember which one is more or more older.

12
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:52,630
Rym: So the only reason it changed is that OAV started being used basically to refer to animated pornography.

13
00:00:53,293 --> 00:00:54,270
Scott: I don't, never heard of this.

14
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:55,248
Rym: You really didn't know that?

15
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:55,636
Rym: No.

16
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,310
Rym: That's the main reason why they started calling them OVAs instead.

17
00:00:59,651 --> 00:01:02,690
Scott: I thought porn was just AV, like adult video.

18
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,010
Rym: Yeah, but OAV was too close to AV, they sort of just combined...

19
00:01:07,132 --> 00:01:08,389
Scott: I never heard this story in my whole life.

20
00:01:08,512 --> 00:01:09,469
Rym: You really never heard that?

21
00:01:09,593 --> 00:01:09,745
Rym: No.

22
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:10,228
Rym: Never?

23
00:01:10,492 --> 00:01:10,536
Rym: No.

24
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,590
Rym: We've even brought this up on panels before.

25
00:01:12,792 --> 00:01:13,468
Scott: I've never heard it.

26
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:14,146
Rym: Okay.

27
00:01:15,031 --> 00:01:19,190
Rym: Anyway, but, Anime News Network still says OAV.

28
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,869
Rym: So you can tell how old the people are who copy edit that stuff.

29
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,530
Rym: So, yeah, it's summer.

30
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:27,527
Rym: It's hot as balls out.

31
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:28,410
Rym: Yay.

32
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,207
Rym: Meaning it's hard for us to make content.

33
00:01:30,267 --> 00:01:35,289
Scott: that isn't... While I was waiting in the doctor's office on the TV, there was like a press conference with the mayor, like he has every day.

34
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,270
Scott: And he was basically like, "It's way hot out.

35
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:39,210
Scott: Check on your neighbors.

36
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:42,289
Scott: Make sure they didn't die, especially if they're old or kids or sick or

37
00:01:42,309 --> 00:01:42,490
Scott: something.".

38
00:01:42,951 --> 00:01:43,949
Rym: I don't know any of my neighbors.

39
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:45,003
Scott: "Drink water and stay

40
00:01:45,044 --> 00:01:45,390
Scott: inside.".

41
00:01:46,332 --> 00:01:47,290
Rym: Well, I saw even worse.

42
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:48,167
Rym: So I grew up in Michigan, right?

43
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,229
Scott: So I started thinking like, "Man, if I was mayor, I would get up there right

44
00:01:51,269 --> 00:01:51,370
Scott: now.".

45
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,089
Scott: And I'd be like, "Hey, New York.

46
00:01:53,671 --> 00:01:54,049
Rym: It's hot.

47
00:01:54,712 --> 00:01:55,267
Rym: All right.

48
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,590
Scott: Don't complain to me in the summer when you can't plow the street.

49
00:01:58,690 --> 00:01:59,505
Scott: You'd be wishing for this

50
00:01:59,546 --> 00:01:59,750
Scott: shit.".

51
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,887
Rym: So even today, I walked outside of work, right?

52
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,870
Scott: And the mayor's keeping the pools open until eight.

53
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:08,669
Scott: I'd be like, "Dog, we're keeping the pools open until 8 AM, okay?

54
00:02:09,452 --> 00:02:10,110
Scott: Pools all night.

55
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,889
Scott: Anyone who knows how to be a lifeguard, sign up.

56
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,850
Scott: We'll pay you double.

57
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:14,566
Scott: Work overnight.

58
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,108
Scott: We're going to have some night pool.

59
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,889
Scott: We're going to have some hot dog vendors rolling up.

60
00:02:19,491 --> 00:02:21,590
Scott: It's going to be all the most amazing.

61
00:02:22,111 --> 00:02:24,630
Scott: After midnight, we'll let you get drunk in the pool.

62
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:25,848
Scott: If you drown, it's all on you.

63
00:02:27,853 --> 00:02:29,190
Scott: It's going to be good times, everybody.

64
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:30,234
Scott: Night

65
00:02:30,255 --> 00:02:30,521
Scott: swim.".

66
00:02:31,031 --> 00:02:33,830
Rym: But even today, I was walking outside from my office.

67
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:36,956
Scott: "If anyone's got a fire hydrant, you want us to make it into a sprinkler, just call me

68
00:02:37,081 --> 00:02:37,144
Scott: up?".

69
00:02:37,351 --> 00:02:37,801
Rym: "Well, you can do

70
00:02:37,842 --> 00:02:38,026
Rym: that.".

71
00:02:38,251 --> 00:02:38,456
Scott: "Fire

72
00:02:38,476 --> 00:02:38,886
Scott: department?".

73
00:02:39,151 --> 00:02:40,547
Rym: "You saw, they do that for

74
00:02:40,567 --> 00:02:40,749
Rym: real.".

75
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:41,990
Scott: "I'm just saying, call 311.

76
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,377
Scott: We'll hook you

77
00:02:42,499 --> 00:02:42,540
Scott: up.".

78
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:49,170
Rym: "I'm actually very happy that they do that because when I was a kid, I had hacks mode for one thing.

79
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,228
Scott: "You come by city hall, we got flavor ice for the

80
00:02:52,248 --> 00:02:52,530
Scott: kids.".

81
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,181
Rym: "There's a fire hydrant in the easement past the sidewalk, right in front of our house, right?

82
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:00,808
Rym: My dad was a fireman, so he could just open the fire

83
00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:01,150
Rym: hydrant.".

84
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,188
Scott: "I mean, anyone with a wrench can open the fire

85
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:03,350
Scott: hydrant.".

86
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,429
Rym: "But he could open it, and no one would hassle us about

87
00:03:06,469 --> 00:03:06,510
Rym: it.".

88
00:03:06,631 --> 00:03:09,007
Scott: "I could open the one near my house, and no one will hassle me for a long

89
00:03:09,068 --> 00:03:09,350
Scott: time.".

90
00:03:09,732 --> 00:03:13,589
Rym: "They might hassle you sooner than you think, unless you have a spray cap on it of some kind.

91
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:18,126
Rym: Because if you just open it, that water pressure drop is substantial and

92
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:18,889
Rym: widespread.".

93
00:03:19,173 --> 00:03:19,358
Rym: "Yeah.".

94
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:24,629
Rym: "So my dad had, and the fire department had a whole bunch of these things, but we just kept one at home.

95
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:28,908
Rym: It wasn't like the ones we have in New York now, that have little holes in the top to make the arcs.

96
00:03:29,432 --> 00:03:35,247
Rym: It was basically a big pipe that came out and went up at an angle pretty big, and had wedges cut out of

97
00:03:35,328 --> 00:03:35,369
Rym: it.".

98
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,650
Scott: "I'm sure if you go on eBay, you can buy all sorts of fun things to attach to the fire

99
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:38,890
Scott: hydrant.".

100
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:49,061
Rym: "Yeah, but this one made a wall of water that blocked the street, and occasionally we would just set it up, and my dad would just call the fire department and be like, 'By the way, I'm doing

101
00:03:49,082 --> 00:03:49,230
Rym: this.'".

102
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,281
Scott: "I think that's called a car

103
00:03:50,302 --> 00:03:50,585
Scott: wash.".

104
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,645
Scott: "That's what that's called, you put one on each side of the

105
00:03:54,665 --> 00:03:54,867
Scott: street.".

106
00:03:55,511 --> 00:03:56,880
Rym: "So I was walking outside, though, today, and it was

107
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,101
Rym: pleasant.".

108
00:03:58,751 --> 00:04:00,310
Rym: "It was basically perfect weather.

109
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:07,780
Rym: But then I stepped into the shade, and I was like, 'Hey, it could be warmer, I'd be happier if it was a little

110
00:04:07,801 --> 00:04:08,128
Rym: warmer.'".

111
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:14,607
Scott: "I mean, most of the heat comes from actually literally being in the sun, or things that are in the sun basically cooking, and then releasing heat

112
00:04:14,707 --> 00:04:15,030
Scott: upwards.".

113
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:16,183
Rym: "Well, it only got to 92 today, so...".

114
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:21,966
Scott: "Yeah, it's like, if I go in the, while I'm biking, if I go in the shade, it's like, 'Ooh, it's not hot at all in the

115
00:04:22,005 --> 00:04:22,410
Scott: shade.'.

116
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:44,091
Scott: It's really literally only hot where the sun is, and a lot of places in New York City, you know, 'cause it's not like there's any big things casting shade, it's like, if you're under a tree, it's like, pretty much underneath a tree never gets sun, 'cause it's not gone from the side, it's not gone from the, you know, there's like, no way the sun can get in directly under the tree, so places that are shady are probably shady, like, most of the

117
00:04:44,112 --> 00:04:44,357
Scott: day.".

118
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:57,750
Rym: "So Scott, on OAV OVA, like, I actually found the original forum discussion where I got that answer to start using in panels, but I figured, maybe that, you know, maybe that was an anecdote that was incorrect.

119
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,387
Rym: Even the Anime News Network has a whole page dedicated to

120
00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:01,608
Rym: this.".

121
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:03,145
Scott: "Okay.".

122
00:05:03,311 --> 00:05:04,110
Rym: "So, uh, yeah.

123
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:05,725
Rym: I'm just, I'm surprised you don't remember

124
00:05:05,746 --> 00:05:05,888
Rym: that.".

125
00:05:06,155 --> 00:05:06,323
Scott: "Nope.".

126
00:05:06,913 --> 00:05:09,588
Rym: "We've literally, like, talked about that on panels more than

127
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:09,849
Rym: once.".

128
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,310
Scott: "Alright, so let's news.

129
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:24,387
Scott: So, Otakon just happened, Gen Con is happening, but the big news from Otakon isn't necessarily anything that happened at Otakon, even though there are some exciting licenses and acquisitions and things that are going to be in

130
00:05:24,447 --> 00:05:24,650
Scott: English.".

131
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:28,888
Rym: "There's actually going to be, like, a good round of anime in the US

132
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:29,249
Rym: coming.".

133
00:05:29,431 --> 00:05:30,108
Scott: "Yeah, it's good stuff.

134
00:05:30,591 --> 00:05:36,090
Scott: But the most important thing is that Otakon's attendance went way down.

135
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:43,447
Scott: Now you might think, well, that's unique to Otakon, Anime Boston's attendance went up, and that is correct, but Geneticon's attendance went

136
00:05:43,507 --> 00:05:43,869
Scott: down.".

137
00:05:44,171 --> 00:05:49,049
Rym: "And I have it on good authority that a lot of conventions lost a lot of people this

138
00:05:49,069 --> 00:05:49,230
Rym: year.".

139
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:50,342
Scott: "That aren't gaming

140
00:05:50,424 --> 00:05:50,930
Scott: conventions.".

141
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,665
Rym: "Yes, but not all conventions, which is very

142
00:05:53,805 --> 00:05:54,107
Rym: interesting.".

143
00:05:55,631 --> 00:06:04,210
Scott: "So, but, yeah, it seems like on most conventions, especially the anime types, attendance went down, but others went up.

144
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,230
Scott: It's a strange year.

145
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,650
Scott: And the attendance didn't go down a little bit.

146
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:07,481
Scott: The attendance went down a

147
00:06:07,684 --> 00:06:07,907
Scott: lot.".

148
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:16,448
Scott: "I think Otakon, the report I saw-" "I heard a rumored number of 25,000, which is lower than, like, the 2009 number, which is the last time we

149
00:06:16,549 --> 00:06:16,750
Scott: went.".

150
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:19,157
Rym: "The number I heard was 6,000 fewer than-".

151
00:06:19,398 --> 00:06:24,322
Scott: "For a convention that only has 30-something thousand, that is a huge

152
00:06:24,423 --> 00:06:24,726
Scott: drop.".

153
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:31,228
Rym: "Now, at the same time, remember, we're talking Otakon, one of the huge points of respect is that they count, basically, the real

154
00:06:31,309 --> 00:06:31,450
Rym: number.".

155
00:06:31,571 --> 00:06:36,930
Scott: "I use Otakon as, you know how in the comics industry they use Batman to figure out how much your comic is selling?

156
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,121
Scott: It's like they'll tell you, 'Well, you sold 1.2 Batman's

157
00:06:39,161 --> 00:06:39,362
Scott: worth.'.

158
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:45,227
Scott: Well, I basically use Otakon as the measurement, because they have the exact numbers for

159
00:06:45,508 --> 00:06:45,890
Scott: everything.".

160
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:48,744
Rym: "Like, PAX is even smaller than Otakon, guys,

161
00:06:49,065 --> 00:06:49,869
Rym: attendance-wise.".

162
00:06:50,191 --> 00:06:51,825
Scott: "Depends on the PAX, but yeah, most

163
00:06:51,865 --> 00:06:52,228
Scott: PAXes.".

164
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,100
Rym: "Yeah, that is most

165
00:06:53,141 --> 00:06:53,547
Rym: PAXes.".

166
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:58,910
Scott: "Anyway, but yeah, so, but I guess not now, though, because Otakon just shrank a whole

167
00:06:59,030 --> 00:06:59,140
Scott: bunch.".

168
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:03,149
Rym: "Someone pointed out that this actually makes Otakon the third biggest anime convention now.

169
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,427
Rym: Anime Central is bigger than

170
00:07:04,488 --> 00:07:04,528
Rym: it.".

171
00:07:04,733 --> 00:07:05,043
Rym: "Maybe.".

172
00:07:05,311 --> 00:07:06,524
Rym: "Maybe we should start going back to Anime

173
00:07:06,564 --> 00:07:06,908
Rym: Central.".

174
00:07:07,251 --> 00:07:08,704
Scott: "Yeah, go all the way over there, it's far

175
00:07:08,744 --> 00:07:08,906
Scott: away.".

176
00:07:09,571 --> 00:07:10,136
Scott: "I don't know, I feel-".

177
00:07:10,156 --> 00:07:11,367
Scott: "But it's a really easy place to fly

178
00:07:11,407 --> 00:07:11,508
Scott: to.".

179
00:07:11,911 --> 00:07:14,627
Rym: "Yeah, the other thing is, I haven't been to Asa in a long time, and it was

180
00:07:14,707 --> 00:07:15,009
Rym: big.".

181
00:07:15,271 --> 00:07:16,150
Scott: "Is it really worth going?

182
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,727
Scott: I mean, we go to Anime Boston, how's it gonna be any

183
00:07:17,767 --> 00:07:18,010
Scott: different?".

184
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,682
Rym: "So, one, it was way big, like, back in 2002, 2003, when I was going.

185
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:34,107
Rym: And two, I really feel bad about the fact that we write really good anime panels and do them at two cons every year, maybe three if we go to Zenkai

186
00:07:34,127 --> 00:07:34,369
Rym: Con.".

187
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:38,554
Scott: "So you want to just take the things, you know, you do repeats, but if you go to more places-".

188
00:07:38,615 --> 00:07:53,303
Rym: "When I write, like, a gaming panel, I do it at two PAXes and every other con, but at the same time, we go to so many PAXes that I feel like I'm constantly writing at least one gaming panel, but yet, I have anime panels that I've literally only ever done

189
00:07:53,504 --> 00:07:53,685
Rym: once.".

190
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:54,604
Scott: "Oh well.

191
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:58,410
Scott: So anyway, B10 is way down, what are explanations for this?

192
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:03,398
Scott: Well, one, it could be Otakon-specific issues, such as being in Baltimore, which is a troubled place

193
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:03,807
Scott: lately.".

194
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,926
Rym: "However, I don't think that's the

195
00:08:05,967 --> 00:08:06,249
Rym: cause.".

196
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:09,008
Scott: "It could be overall economic woes affecting all

197
00:08:09,028 --> 00:08:09,250
Scott: conventions.".

198
00:08:09,532 --> 00:08:11,887
Rym: "I think that's the overall cause for all the

199
00:08:11,907 --> 00:08:12,269
Rym: drops.".

200
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:31,570
Scott: "It could be that, you know, anime-specific issues, like, yeah, you know, people are still into anime, the young people, but the generation of the big generation, the Naruto Fullmetal Alchemist generation grew out of it, and the generation behind that is smaller, anime-wise, and like, this was the big year where that generation grew up, maybe?

201
00:08:32,076 --> 00:08:32,746
Scott: And they dropped out?

202
00:08:33,451 --> 00:08:47,087
Scott: Also, you know, even at conventions I go to, it's like the huge, huge things like Homestucks and whatnot, and Hetalia's, it's like, they're still there, but they're all small, there isn't currently, like, a thing that is the big

203
00:08:47,188 --> 00:08:47,510
Scott: thing.".

204
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:53,408
Rym: "Well, at the same time, those kind of got replaced by other things, like, you saw those tweets, I've been slowly analyzing the data from

205
00:08:53,428 --> 00:08:53,610
Rym: ConnectiCon.".

206
00:08:53,630 --> 00:09:00,001
Scott: "There isn't, still, there isn't one mega-fandom right now, the way there has been, sort of every year there's been at least one thing.

207
00:09:00,021 --> 00:09:00,847
Scott: that was the

208
00:09:00,887 --> 00:09:01,350
Scott: mega-fandom.".

209
00:09:01,591 --> 00:09:12,130
Rym: "That's kind of true, but at the same time, like, look at the numbers, like, Homestuck seemed really big, but it wasn't bigger than, like, Lodos War was at AnimeCons in the early

210
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:13,051
Rym: 2000s.".

211
00:09:13,751 --> 00:09:19,201
Scott: "Percentage-wise, maybe, but total absolute numbers-wise, it's got to be way bigger than Lodos War in the

212
00:09:19,303 --> 00:09:19,608
Scott: U.S.".

213
00:09:19,811 --> 00:09:21,027
Rym: "Nah, at cons, hard to say,

214
00:09:21,047 --> 00:09:21,229
Rym: actually.".

215
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:23,019
Scott: "You think Lodos War in the U.S.

216
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,807
Scott: had more viewers than Homestuck has

217
00:09:24,868 --> 00:09:25,109
Scott: readers?".

218
00:09:25,877 --> 00:09:26,970
Rym: "I'm talking conventions only.

219
00:09:27,751 --> 00:09:29,328
Rym: The viewers, readers, consumers that go to

220
00:09:29,348 --> 00:09:29,570
Rym: conventions.".

221
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:42,306
Scott: "You're saying the total number, you're saying the number of people that were, that would say they had Lodos War fans that went to a convention is equal to the number of people who went to a convention who would say they were a Homestuck

222
00:09:42,326 --> 00:09:42,427
Scott: fan?".

223
00:09:43,371 --> 00:09:49,943
Rym: "If you're comparing AnimeCons in the early 2000s to cons in the last few years, I actually think they'd be pretty

224
00:09:49,984 --> 00:09:50,249
Rym: close.".

225
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,246
Scott: "The absolute number of human

226
00:09:52,287 --> 00:09:52,609
Scott: beings.".

227
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:52,955
Rym: "I think

228
00:09:52,996 --> 00:09:53,159
Rym: so.".

229
00:09:53,750 --> 00:10:02,441
Scott: "I think the number of people who would call themselves Homestuck fans, even this year that went to conventions, is more than the total number of people that went to conventions back

230
00:10:02,483 --> 00:10:02,627
Scott: then.".

231
00:10:02,891 --> 00:10:06,149
Rym: "Homestuck panel attendance was precipitously down,

232
00:10:06,169 --> 00:10:06,350
Rym: however.".

233
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,705
Scott: "That doesn't mean that the people wouldn't call themselves Homestuck

234
00:10:08,746 --> 00:10:09,048
Scott: fans.".

235
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:14,023
Rym: "Yeah, but at the same time, Lodos War was something that in the early 2000s, every goddamn anime fan had

236
00:10:14,186 --> 00:10:14,349
Rym: seen.".

237
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,569
Scott: "Yes, all 200 people at the convention had seen Lodos

238
00:10:16,609 --> 00:10:16,690
Scott: War.".

239
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,685
Rym: "Even back then, Otakon was pretty

240
00:10:18,726 --> 00:10:19,028
Rym: big.".

241
00:10:19,474 --> 00:10:20,130
Scott: "I'm just saying.

242
00:10:21,232 --> 00:10:21,628
Rym: Anyway.".

243
00:10:21,811 --> 00:10:39,169
Rym: "So, uh, I suspect, now, I'm privy to a little more information from other cons and things and there's some inside stuff, but one thing you guys gotta remember is that there are kind of like two fundamental classes of conventions in terms of the attendees, and this is something that hasn't ever really been talked about a lot.

244
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:42,910
Rym: Most people talk about like, "Oh, well I kinda had this guest or that guest or whatever,".

245
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:54,429
Rym: but some cons draw primarily people who are local to it physically, and some cons draw a big international or multi-state flying and driving in

246
00:10:54,449 --> 00:10:54,710
Rym: attendance.".

247
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,310
Scott: "Well look, GenCon is happening right now.

248
00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:02,990
Scott: That draws people from all over, but if you go to GenCon and do a survey, right, I mean people come from other countries to go to GenCon, right?

249
00:11:03,971 --> 00:11:08,708
Scott: If you do a survey there, you will still find that most of the people at GenCon are from the Midwest.

250
00:11:09,871 --> 00:11:15,038
Scott: 'Cause even if you're the super tabletop gamer, the farther away you are, the less like you are to

251
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:15,122
Scott: go.".

252
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,109
Rym: "Oh yeah, from the Midwest, but I'm talking about-".

253
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:23,608
Scott: "If you go to PAX Prime, most of the people there are from the Northwest, even though people come from Australia to go to PAX

254
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:23,790
Scott: Prime.".

255
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:30,309
Rym: "However, there's a pretty high- remember, they did that survey a while ago, there was a pretty high percentage of people who are not local coming in, like higher than

256
00:11:30,329 --> 00:11:41,027
Scott: other I'm saying is that you have cons that are like 90% local, like a ConnectiCon, and then you have cons that are like- even the most international cons are only like 50%

257
00:11:41,027 --> 00:11:41,188
Scott: local.".

258
00:11:41,731 --> 00:11:43,730
Rym: "No, but I'm talking more radius draw.

259
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:53,395
Rym: Like there are a lot of cons that the vast majority of the attendees, it's not like 'oh they're from the Midwest' or 'they're from the state,' it's like 'they're within a 30 minute

260
00:11:53,456 --> 00:11:54,045
Rym: drive.'.

261
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:58,870
Rym: Like they are not like further away in the state is not even coming.

262
00:11:59,811 --> 00:12:09,249
Rym: And those cons are highly dependent upon the local economy and really like the kinds of issues that you wouldn't think about.

263
00:12:09,751 --> 00:12:14,449
Rym: Like ConnectiCon, the results are actually public, but they had a survey that you could fill out and then you'd see some of the results.

264
00:12:15,071 --> 00:12:23,330
Rym: And from what I could gather, the primary thing that determined according to attendees whether or not they'd come seemed to be the ease of parking.

265
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:26,409
Rym: And number two was like, could they stay in the hotel?

266
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,750
Rym: Like programming and other things.

267
00:12:30,171 --> 00:12:32,090
Rym: And it's not just like ConnectiCon is the only one like that.

268
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,830
Scott: People are looking at those things to decide whether to come.

269
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:34,990
Scott: It's like they're going to ConnectiCon.

270
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:38,410
Scott: If they're, you know, they're a nerd, they know ConnectiCon exists and they're close.

271
00:12:38,553 --> 00:12:39,268
Scott: It's like they want to go.

272
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,950
Scott: They don't even look care which guest is coming.

273
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:47,226
Scott: Or, you know, I mean, there are some people, there's like always one or two people every year who are like, "I'm here to see this

274
00:12:47,307 --> 00:12:47,589
Scott: person."

275
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,850
Scott: And that's because they're a fan of that guest.

276
00:12:50,212 --> 00:12:52,709
Scott: They found out about the con and they decided to come to it.

277
00:12:53,234 --> 00:12:54,530
Scott: But that's very few people.

278
00:12:54,751 --> 00:12:55,814
Rym: But there's another factor to.

279
00:12:55,874 --> 00:13:03,530
Rym: the people who go to hyper local cons tend to not be as internet enabled, tend to tweet or smartphones as much.

280
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:12,990
Rym: And usually because they're going to the hyper local con and that's their thing, they very rarely go to other conventions or go to conventions on a regular basis.

281
00:13:13,931 --> 00:13:21,569
Rym: That's the stuff I'd really like to see in a survey is for any given con, like how many other cons in a year does that person go to?

282
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:24,189
Scott: Most people go to a con, that's their only con they go to.

283
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:24,651
Rym: Yeah.

284
00:13:24,932 --> 00:13:33,770
Rym: So I think the badges being more expensive, the economy in America being not great for the middle and lower middle class and the working poor combined.

285
00:13:34,431 --> 00:13:40,988
Rym: I think that is the primary cause of a drop in attendance in cons like Oticon.

286
00:13:41,349 --> 00:13:44,150
Rym: that also dropped primarily from a very local region.

287
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,390
Scott: Well, you got to think, you know, economy wise also, right?

288
00:13:46,511 --> 00:13:53,850
Scott: If you are someone who doesn't have a lot of money, but you're a con goer, you're going you went and you're the con goer who's a big con goer went to many cons.

289
00:13:54,411 --> 00:13:58,010
Scott: You're now cutting out the lower con and go into the big con.

290
00:13:58,291 --> 00:13:58,552
Scott: Right.

291
00:13:59,215 --> 00:14:04,790
Scott: Then you would think, well, then shouldn't Oticon attendance go up and the other con, you know, attendance go down.

292
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:09,768
Scott: But maybe at the same time, there's the other logic, which is, well, OK, you're a multi con goer.

293
00:14:10,153 --> 00:14:11,449
Scott: You don't have a lot of money this year.

294
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:14,890
Scott: You cut out the big con and only go to the local one because it's cheaper.

295
00:14:15,693 --> 00:14:16,930
Scott: So there's a lot going on there.

296
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,929
Scott: It's like, you know, so many factors to figure out.

297
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:27,570
Rym: There's also the fact that I think the average attendee of almost any con, except for the ones that are now hard to get into, just don't even really know much about the cons.

298
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:30,750
Rym: I mean, I told this anecdote on Twitter, but I'm not lying.

299
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:38,029
Rym: Person asked me straight up at a convention what a panel was.

300
00:14:38,952 --> 00:14:40,569
Scott: People asked us if the panels were free.

301
00:14:41,271 --> 00:14:43,690
Scott: And yeah, multiple people were like, we got to pay to go.

302
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:45,149
Scott: I'm like, no, you paid to get in here.

303
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:46,497
Scott: Everything else is free.

304
00:14:46,517 --> 00:14:48,730
Scott: It's like an amusement park and not like the carny.

305
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:49,692
Rym: Yep.

306
00:14:50,394 --> 00:14:55,430
Rym: So, yeah, we'll see, like we'll wait for the full numbers and we'll wait for some more analysis and everything.

307
00:14:55,650 --> 00:15:00,152
Rym: But it'll be a very interesting thing that I'd like someone else to track because I'm going to forget.

308
00:15:00,172 --> 00:15:10,368
Rym: is for that, for that, like this year, 2015, it would be really interesting to see a list of significant fan cons that gained a lot of attendance and significant fan cons that lost a lot of it.

309
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:18,930
Scott: We should take, you know, con attendance numbers, make sure they're all get the numbers that match up the same way and go year to year and then combine the cons together.

310
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:22,769
Scott: And like make some sort of, you know, time lapse graph thingy.

311
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:23,774
Rym: You know what I'd use?

312
00:15:23,794 --> 00:15:27,228
Rym: Remember that graph with the spheres to talk about first world, second world, third world stuff?

313
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:35,770
Scott: You could do a lot of, you know, visualizations that would, you know, reveal an interesting information year over year con attendance.

314
00:15:36,091 --> 00:15:42,390
Rym: But on a side note, you know, Otakon, you know, despite the drastically lower attendance, hotels for next year went on sale.

315
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:47,430
Rym: And I saw everyone on Twitter being like, oh, my God, the battle for Otakon hotel rooms.

316
00:15:47,671 --> 00:15:50,710
Rym: And I remember thinking back, never had to battle for Otakon hotel rooms.

317
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:53,929
Rym: You only had to battle if you wanted to stay in like the tiny days in.

318
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:59,230
Scott: That's everyone wants to stay in the days because it's like a hundred bucks a night because, A, it's really cheap, right?

319
00:15:59,752 --> 00:16:01,730
Scott: B, it's really crappy, but they don't seem to care.

320
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:02,459
Scott: It's really cheap.

321
00:16:02,499 --> 00:16:03,249
Scott: It's really close.

322
00:16:03,991 --> 00:16:11,790
Scott: And if you're a cosplayer being that much closer and not having to walk two extra blocks is a big deal because it's a summer con heat outside.

323
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:13,529
Scott: But I remember possibly rain.

324
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:17,170
Rym: If you didn't want to be in the days in, you could wait weeks.

325
00:16:17,412 --> 00:16:19,250
Scott: You need a lot of money to not stay in the days.

326
00:16:19,471 --> 00:16:20,058
Rym: It's not that much.

327
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:21,050
Rym: We stayed in the Renaissance.

328
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,199
Rym: It wasn't that much money.

329
00:16:22,361 --> 00:16:23,310
Scott: It was twice as much.

330
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:23,711
Scott: Yes.

331
00:16:23,751 --> 00:16:28,107
Rym: But however, if you forget, the days in was so is so we also.

332
00:16:28,148 --> 00:16:32,190
Scott: when we were poor, we stayed in that Renaissance with a lot of people.

333
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:32,611
Rym: We did.

334
00:16:32,751 --> 00:16:42,890
Rym: But my point is that the days in has so few rooms available that using that as a price and saying another hotel is twice as expensive is literally worthless.

335
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:48,334
Rym: because the vast majority of people who go to the con two hundred bucks a night is just what hotels cost.

336
00:16:48,354 --> 00:16:51,430
Rym: There's happened to be one really, really cheap hotel.

337
00:16:51,951 --> 00:16:52,574
Rym: It's nearby.

338
00:16:52,635 --> 00:16:56,113
Scott: You're getting your hundred extra dollars a night worth if you stay in a different hotel.

339
00:16:56,495 --> 00:16:59,470
Scott: But it was in their hotel attached to the convention center now.

340
00:16:59,691 --> 00:17:00,476
Rym: Well, there always was.

341
00:17:00,496 --> 00:17:04,530
Rym: But remember, they blocked it off that one year because they hated the Otakon people and they didn't even have a room block.

342
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:05,679
Scott: No, no, no, not that one.

343
00:17:05,719 --> 00:17:06,950
Scott: The one the new one, the Hilton.

344
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,016
Scott: Yeah, the one that's attack.

345
00:17:08,036 --> 00:17:10,794
Rym: Yeah, that they're way on the other side attached to the weird wing.

346
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:11,377
Scott: Right.

347
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:12,022
Rym: Yeah, that's there.

348
00:17:12,124 --> 00:17:12,930
Scott: Why not stay in that?

349
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:13,611
Rym: Yeah.

350
00:17:13,631 --> 00:17:18,848
Rym: So everyone was tweeting about this this morning about how, like, oh, my God, the Otakon battle at five, at five, stay in that.

351
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,410
Rym: But then they went on sale.

352
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:32,272
Rym: So hours later, I clicked on the Otakon link and I was like, I wonder hours later in packs, you've got like 30 minutes of pretty much every hotel still had plenty of rooms.

353
00:17:32,694 --> 00:17:36,130
Rym: Only the days in was sold out and it was totally fine.

354
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,349
Rym: Like I could have just booked a room.

355
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:45,335
Scott: So, kids, seriously, don't whine like if you can't afford the not days in, don't go or do what we did.

356
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:46,650
Scott: I mean, we see attendance is low.

357
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,710
Scott: We're not trying to say if you're poor, you should be going.

358
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:50,489
Scott: We're saying if you're poor, don't go.

359
00:17:50,831 --> 00:17:52,269
Scott: Like all the people who are poor didn't.

360
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,489
Rym: We always went where we were poor.

361
00:17:53,812 --> 00:17:54,559
Rym: We just crammed.

362
00:17:54,781 --> 00:17:55,670
Rym: We get two rooms.

363
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:59,672
Scott: Only if you're a college student, if you're not a college student anymore, it's not acceptable.

364
00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:01,829
Rym: We get two rooms adjoining in the Renaissance every year.

365
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,978
Rym: So we'd have two bathrooms.

366
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,650
Scott: You're an adult and you can't afford to go.

367
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:13,494
Scott: You shouldn't be going now if I was if I was as poor as I was in college, because I save up, you can just go to PAX every other year or something like that instead of going to Otakon.

368
00:18:13,575 --> 00:18:14,078
Rym: What if you hate?

369
00:18:14,239 --> 00:18:16,498
Rym: what if you hate games in your primary interest in the world's anime?

370
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,209
Scott: Why are you listening?

371
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,809
Rym: Well, for the Wednesday night, of course, you're an awful person.

372
00:18:22,011 --> 00:18:26,348
Scott: I'd say the same thing about someone who would say they're only interested in games and they don't like animes.

373
00:18:27,951 --> 00:18:37,230
Rym: Anyway, but yeah, we we put seven people in one room, six people in the room next door, and that was the literal maximum loading capacity without disaster.

374
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:39,847
Scott: Do you have a news or are you just going to talk about?

375
00:18:39,867 --> 00:18:40,269
Scott: that's the end?

376
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:44,911
Rym: So Rick and Morty came back season two and I watched the first episode because it just came out.

377
00:18:44,931 --> 00:18:48,127
Scott: You're watching all these great shows because they're basically it's.

378
00:18:48,388 --> 00:18:54,670
Rym: there's been a huge renaissance for years now in a lot of really good American cartoons.

379
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:59,085
Rym: So Rick and Morty, Scott would hate it, but he hates everything is like.

380
00:18:59,126 --> 00:19:05,510
Rym: season one was atypical and I didn't expect like I'd seen the first the pilot fighting this show.

381
00:19:06,071 --> 00:19:06,172
Scott: Huh?

382
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:07,710
Scott: Are you fighting the show or is there a news?

383
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:08,132
Rym: Sort of.

384
00:19:08,173 --> 00:19:09,589
Rym: Well, the news is it came back season two.

385
00:19:09,871 --> 00:19:14,316
Rym: OK, and the first episode just happened and you can just watch it for free on their website, like like.

386
00:19:14,498 --> 00:19:16,330
Rym: you don't have to like pirate it or anything.

387
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:17,449
Rym: It's just there or get cable.

388
00:19:17,832 --> 00:19:19,790
Rym: No, you just watch it totally for free online.

389
00:19:20,171 --> 00:19:22,469
Rym: It's a full 24 minute episode of a show.

390
00:19:23,311 --> 00:19:28,450
Rym: But when I watched the pilot, I didn't expect I'd like it.

391
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:33,409
Rym: I thought it was going to be basically like when South Park first came out, like, OK, this is just swearing.

392
00:19:34,572 --> 00:19:38,090
Rym: I don't think I need to watch the show, but it got really clever, really good.

393
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:42,692
Rym: And actually, it's one of my like recent favorite comedy cartoons or just comedy shows in general.

394
00:19:43,634 --> 00:19:48,610
Rym: So my worry was many shows that are that good cannot sustain.

395
00:19:49,091 --> 00:19:53,434
Rym: And Rick and Morty had the benefit of having a very small number of very high quality episodes.

396
00:19:54,219 --> 00:19:55,910
Rym: And a new season just came out, just began.

397
00:19:56,030 --> 00:20:00,406
Rym: And episode one not only was great, it actually had a long.

398
00:20:00,467 --> 00:20:03,009
Scott: when you get an episode one of a new season, you had a long time to work on it.

399
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:11,388
Rym: Yeah, but it did something that I never didn't really expect you could do correctly in a television show.

400
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:17,250
Rym: Basically, the plot of this episode involves multiple realities sort of splitting.

401
00:20:17,612 --> 00:20:19,090
Rym: So like the two possibilities happen.

402
00:20:19,454 --> 00:20:20,430
Rym: So the screen splits.

403
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,670
Scott: I've never seen that before.

404
00:20:21,891 --> 00:20:22,473
Rym: No, no, no.

405
00:20:22,694 --> 00:20:27,290
Rym: So the screen splits and you see both happening at the same time.

406
00:20:28,532 --> 00:20:39,910
Rym: And then it splits again and it kind of splits and unsplits and things happen, but you get a full audio and video from both parallel universes or quadruple or whatever, all at the same time on screen.

407
00:20:40,753 --> 00:20:43,610
Rym: And somehow they totally pull it off.

408
00:20:43,671 --> 00:20:45,110
Rym: And it was actually kind of amazing.

409
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:48,529
Rym: It was a fantastic episode of a show.

410
00:20:50,118 --> 00:20:50,520
Rym: No, it didn't.

411
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,370
Rym: That's actually something the Simpsons literally never did.

412
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:56,269
Rym: I just said, I know you did, but it's the one thing the Simpsons didn't do.

413
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:02,580
Rym: I think there have been alternate reality episodes not showing you both at the same time in real time.

414
00:21:02,641 --> 00:21:03,289
Scott: Not that I've seen.

415
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:03,711
Scott: No.

416
00:21:04,275 --> 00:21:06,430
Rym: And frankly, the show is as funny as always was.

417
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:14,780
Rym: If you haven't watched Rick and Morty, watch any episode, but the pilot, because the pilot, it's like watching like if you want to sell someone on South Park, don't show.

418
00:21:18,914 --> 00:21:20,229
Rym: South Park is actually like that.

419
00:21:21,414 --> 00:21:22,829
Rym: Stick him in like season two or three.

420
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:24,015
Rym: It's the same thing here.

421
00:21:24,076 --> 00:21:25,970
Rym: Just watch an episode of Rick and Morty.

422
00:21:27,691 --> 00:21:40,970
Rym: I really like that show and I think it actually might be my favorite comedy cartoon currently, as in something that's aired on TV any time in the last four or five years.

423
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:48,489
Rym: So anyway, things of the day.

424
00:21:49,132 --> 00:21:53,930
Rym: Our good friend Judith has a blog stuff and fluff, cutest cooking.

425
00:21:54,692 --> 00:21:56,710
Rym: It's literally the cutest cooking.

426
00:21:57,472 --> 00:22:00,330
Rym: It's a cooking blog with recipes and stuffed animals and things.

427
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:08,350
Rym: And I think we've mentioned it obliquely a few times, but I really want to make it a thing of the day because she just like started it back up after hiatus.

428
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:10,230
Scott: Are you sure I didn't already make it a thing of the day?

429
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:17,190
Rym: I don't know if you did in history, but the dish that is posted was pretty great.

430
00:22:17,391 --> 00:22:22,793
Rym: And when I saw this post, I remembered eating this dish because it was cooked in our apartment.

431
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:25,970
Rym: And the background that you can't see in these pictures was our apartment.

432
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:29,389
Rym: Seriously, this blog is good stuff.

433
00:22:29,911 --> 00:22:34,409
Rym: And if you're into cooking or cute stuff, I highly recommend it.

434
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:42,355
Scott: So in New York, the subway is mad old, like 100 years old, and the equipment in the subway is mad old.

435
00:22:42,435 --> 00:22:47,468
Scott: And, you know, people talk about upgrading it and whatnot, but they don't really understand just how old.

436
00:22:48,252 --> 00:22:52,909
Scott: Well, the MTA made a video because basically they're trying to get money for their budget right now is a lot of issues.

437
00:22:53,391 --> 00:23:02,770
Scott: So in part of their trying to get money, they made this video showing just how old and busted they are because it's like, hey, the party is less old and busted than we are.

438
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:03,969
Scott: And you're building a new one there.

439
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:05,870
Scott: The trains are even older and busted.

440
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:09,350
Scott: Or why don't you give the money to the trains instead, governor asshole?

441
00:23:09,511 --> 00:23:11,130
Scott: So here's a video.

442
00:23:11,311 --> 00:23:18,250
Scott: And even though this video is trying to do that, you know, in reality, this video doesn't even mention budgets or money or anything.

443
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:25,310
Scott: It just sort of demonstrates, you know, the old technology showing you how old it is and the fact that we're still using it is amazing.

444
00:23:25,891 --> 00:23:31,240
Scott: And it also shows the new technology that is used only in like a few lines because it's all we can afford.

445
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:31,341
Scott: CBTC.

446
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:32,831
Scott: Yeah.

447
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:38,849
Scott: And it shows you how that works and how it's awesome or at least way more awesome than the old way of doing things.

448
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:39,475
Rym: You know what, though?

449
00:23:39,616 --> 00:23:40,970
Rym: It's a concern of New York City.

450
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:47,254
Scott: And almost no other cities in America, but it's still awesome to see old train switching stuff.

451
00:23:47,394 --> 00:23:55,970
Rym: It's awesome to see that technology that looks antiquated, even for a steampunk cosplay, is literally used day to day to make my commute happen.

452
00:23:56,171 --> 00:24:01,498
Scott: And it didn't work today because the end QR was having extensive delays due to signal malfunction.

453
00:24:01,579 --> 00:24:03,170
Rym: Oh, if only you took the seven.

454
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:03,675
Scott: I did.

455
00:24:03,715 --> 00:24:04,689
Scott: I walked over to the seven.

456
00:24:04,892 --> 00:24:06,329
Rym: Yeah, but I take the seven every day.

457
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,153
Rym: It's just great.

458
00:24:08,199 --> 00:24:10,150
Scott: I usually bike enough to worry about either one.

459
00:24:10,773 --> 00:24:12,383
Scott: And you know, I went to the doctor today.

460
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:14,134
Scott: What do you mean?

461
00:24:14,155 --> 00:24:14,417
Scott: Thank you.

462
00:24:14,821 --> 00:24:15,830
Scott: Works almost every day.

463
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:17,066
Scott: The one day it messes up.

464
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:19,195
Scott: Yeah, I've got to know what.

465
00:24:19,597 --> 00:24:27,510
Rym: if I wait for seven from Greensboro Plaza rather than getting on an N or Q that has already arrived, I will reliably get to work fast.

466
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:28,553
Scott: You're going way downtown.

467
00:24:28,573 --> 00:24:36,970
Scott: Yeah, I got a job right near an NQ station and then move to an apartment right near an NQ station so wisely.

468
00:24:38,951 --> 00:24:46,370
Rym: And as a result, straight to work, actually, all I really need is once the T starts running, then the four or five will get slightly less crowded.

469
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:55,532
Scott: I think there'll be an issue when the seven goes beyond Times Square, because then usually you go to Times Square to get in a seven and it's just sitting there waiting for you.

470
00:24:55,693 --> 00:24:55,895
Scott: Yeah.

471
00:24:56,076 --> 00:24:57,850
Scott: Or when it gets there, it empties out completely.

472
00:24:58,331 --> 00:25:07,350
Rym: Now you'll be waiting for those trains, getting people from the west side, except they're going to run on the same schedule and theoretically they can run and more trains because there's more track space and more stop.

473
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:08,593
Scott: Maybe we'll see.

474
00:25:08,774 --> 00:25:13,124
Scott: Also a long distance between once they finish the CVTC, because that's the line that's getting it.

475
00:25:14,315 --> 00:25:15,204
Scott: It should be more trains.

476
00:25:15,406 --> 00:25:15,608
Rym: Yeah.

477
00:25:16,091 --> 00:25:18,710
Rym: In the moment, the book club book is still the wheel of time.

478
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:23,669
Scott: It just keeps on turning its fantasy novel words in a book.

479
00:25:24,654 --> 00:25:26,010
Rym: I I don't know.

480
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:41,590
Rym: I'm increasingly frustrated with every child character for literally you've got a bunch of adults who are obviously trying to help you and you do nothing but but make each other promise to never tell an adult about any of the stupid bullshit you just did.

481
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:45,530
Rym: Like, oh, oh, yeah, I just stole this dagger from this like evil demon guy.

482
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:46,056
Rym: No biggie.

483
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:46,869
Rym: Don't tell the adults.

484
00:25:47,351 --> 00:25:52,693
Rym: Oh, I just had this dream where something pricked me and an evil dude and a god and all this danger.

485
00:25:52,794 --> 00:25:54,182
Rym: And then I woke up and I actually had the.

486
00:25:54,202 --> 00:25:56,769
Scott: let's not tell the people who've saved my life multiple times.

487
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:57,331
Rym: Yeah.

488
00:25:57,411 --> 00:26:01,013
Rym: Let's not trust any of these people, even though they saved our lives multiple times.

489
00:26:01,194 --> 00:26:01,456
Scott: Yep.

490
00:26:01,698 --> 00:26:03,190
Rym: And let's also not trust each other.

491
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:06,750
Rym: And like, I, I really don't like these kids.

492
00:26:06,972 --> 00:26:08,470
Rym: And now all of them have a plot thing.

493
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:12,373
Rym: So I can't be like, well, at least I know two of them are going to die and only one of them matters.

494
00:26:12,434 --> 00:26:14,070
Scott: But yeah, I thought two of them were just hangers on.

495
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:18,352
Scott: But no, then he made him real characters, which would be fine if they weren't just dumb shits.

496
00:26:18,433 --> 00:26:18,734
Scott: Yeah.

497
00:26:18,835 --> 00:26:21,770
Rym: Anyway, I guess Perrin was that guy with the wolf guy.

498
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:21,990
Scott: Yeah.

499
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:26,855
Rym: The wolf guy is probably the best one because he's he looks dumb but is actually super smart.

500
00:26:27,238 --> 00:26:28,710
Scott: I think main guy is the best one.

501
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:29,415
Scott: His main guy.

502
00:26:29,435 --> 00:26:31,310
Rym: Yeah, but he also kind of hides stuff from people.

503
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:31,771
Rym: Yeah.

504
00:26:31,852 --> 00:26:33,210
Rym: The other kid is the dumbest.

505
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:34,036
Scott: He's the dumbest.

506
00:26:34,903 --> 00:26:35,609
Scott: He's the worst.

507
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:37,132
Rym: Yeah.

508
00:26:37,272 --> 00:26:41,890
Scott: Anyway, if he would just die or something, you should come see us at PAX Prime.

509
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:42,753
Scott: It's real soon.

510
00:26:42,773 --> 00:26:48,712
Scott: We're going to be our best convention on for nerds on the face of the earth.

511
00:26:48,833 --> 00:26:48,995
Rym: Yeah.

512
00:26:49,056 --> 00:26:49,704
Rym: You can still.

513
00:26:49,744 --> 00:26:50,170
Rym: I just checked.

514
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:54,030
Rym: You can still at night tonight get hotels for Otakon.

515
00:26:54,190 --> 00:27:06,774
Rym: Meanwhile, Pax Prime, you if you go and try to get a room at a hotel pretty much anywhere in near the convention center in Seattle, you can't even pay full price like there just aren't rooms.

516
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,570
Scott: Well, I have because we are doing panels there.

517
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:14,648
Scott: I have the emergency badge that I bought, which is actually four single day passes.

518
00:27:14,749 --> 00:27:18,270
Scott: Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday are available for sale.

519
00:27:18,531 --> 00:27:26,090
Scott: You could if you are someone who listening to this right now, that means you are someone who I will give preferential treatment and sell them to you at exactly face value.

520
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:30,349
Scott: I'll even pay for the stamp to mail them to you or give them to you in person at the PAX.

521
00:27:30,751 --> 00:27:32,570
Rym: Oh, see my two emergency badges.

522
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,690
Rym: I can't actually mailed anyone because there will call only.

523
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:36,787
Scott: But yeah.

524
00:27:38,171 --> 00:27:42,969
Scott: If if I had to sell them on the Internet, I'm like eBay or something, I'm going to be marking them up and getting some profits.

525
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:53,229
Scott: So, you know, if you want to go if you've got a place to stay or maybe you got an extra friend who's coming or, you know, someone who lives in the area, they don't need a place to stay because they live there, you know.

526
00:27:53,650 --> 00:28:00,250
Rym: Well, I'm giving one of my badges to our good friend Tracy because he totally helped me unfuck that one episode of GeekNights that got fucked up.

527
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:06,552
Scott: That is where that is a. if you do something for me, that is such so great in value as to equal that.

528
00:28:06,612 --> 00:28:11,390
Scott: Yes, I will also give you the except he only wanted the Sunday one.

529
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:12,788
Rym: I was like, I'll give you all four.

530
00:28:13,432 --> 00:28:14,410
Rym: And he's like, that's the thing.

531
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:16,650
Scott: It's like someone was like, I'll just take two from you.

532
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:19,029
Scott: And it's like that's a pain in the ass.

533
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:21,349
Scott: It's much easier for me to get rid of all four at once.

534
00:28:22,361 --> 00:28:22,443
Scott: Yeah.

535
00:28:22,525 --> 00:28:22,750
Scott: Anyway.

536
00:28:23,352 --> 00:28:23,678
Rym: Yeah.

537
00:28:23,943 --> 00:28:24,290
Rym: Facts.

538
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:25,134
Rym: Facts is coming.

539
00:28:25,355 --> 00:28:27,910
Rym: Far future of gaming on Sunday, sports or games on Monday.

540
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:31,648
Rym: And then I'm doing online story driven games on Wednesday in Portland.

541
00:28:33,553 --> 00:28:34,770
Scott: And after PAX, not before.

542
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:35,031
Scott: Yeah.

543
00:28:35,151 --> 00:28:44,110
Rym: And as otherwise, Emily and I and a bunch of us will be at PAX dev just hanging out and we'll be playing tabletop games almost exclusively.

544
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:45,275
Rym: Oh, wizard.

545
00:28:45,335 --> 00:28:45,738
Rym: I'm going to bring.

546
00:28:45,758 --> 00:28:48,709
Rym: I'm going to bring my poker chips, even though other people are bringing poker chips.

547
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,050
Rym: Because we got to play wizard.

548
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:54,150
Scott: I'm going to make a lot of videos of things, including like playing wizard and such.

549
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:54,591
Rym: Yeah.

550
00:28:54,893 --> 00:28:58,780
Rym: I'm going to bring extra tripods and things, do some content creation at my Porto tripod.

551
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,168
Scott: Yeah.

552
00:28:59,412 --> 00:29:00,429
Rym: I also have a Porto tripod.

553
00:29:02,314 --> 00:29:03,005
Scott: That's enough matter.

554
00:29:03,066 --> 00:29:03,290
Scott: Whatever.

555
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:04,177
Scott: Check us on the Internet.

556
00:29:04,197 --> 00:29:05,410
Scott: We're on all the places on the Internet.

557
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:06,274
Scott: Come find us.

558
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:11,790
Scott: So Vampire Hunter D, the original O.A.V I watch a sci fi channel or something.

559
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:17,813
Scott: Noran, I think I might have watched also an anime club VHS subtitle, but that was like 15 years ago.

560
00:29:18,195 --> 00:29:21,030
Scott: So I don't remember very much at all.

561
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:25,089
Rym: I have probably seen the original Vampire Hunter D O.A.V.

562
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:25,733
Rym: from 1985, a hundred times.

563
00:29:29,352 --> 00:29:30,689
Scott: That's a lot of fucking time.

564
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:41,290
Rym: However, ninety nine of those times I last millennium when my age was under 14.

565
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:41,511
Scott: Yeah.

566
00:29:41,612 --> 00:29:41,872
Scott: OK.

567
00:29:42,274 --> 00:29:49,910
Rym: I mean, I first saw them on the side of it on the sci fi channel because my mom made me watch this movie and I actually wasn't super into it.

568
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,290
Rym: But she kind of was like, oh, you got to watch it.

569
00:29:51,431 --> 00:29:52,589
Rym: It's like the Castlevania thing you like.

570
00:29:53,650 --> 00:30:03,270
Rym: And it was a transformative experience because I in fourth grade went from not knowing what anime was to trying to get fan subs.

571
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:04,172
Scott: Right.

572
00:30:04,192 --> 00:30:10,650
Scott: So the first thing to know about Vampire Hunter D is the artwork is Yoshitaka Amano, who is the awesome.

573
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:12,450
Scott: And he was mad young then, I assume.

574
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:14,830
Scott: Yeah, because he's not super old now.

575
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:15,486
Scott: He's just old.

576
00:30:16,612 --> 00:30:19,570
Rym: And it actually stays pretty true to his style.

577
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:19,931
Scott: Right.

578
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:22,610
Scott: I mean, this is the same dude who did the characters.

579
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:25,990
Scott: So Final Fantasy six and other awesome things.

580
00:30:26,131 --> 00:30:28,330
Scott: This is like a big time important art person.

581
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:32,488
Scott: You can tell his style because it's always swooshy and swirly and woofy.

582
00:30:33,912 --> 00:30:36,710
Rym: I was going to say long angular things around.

583
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:39,290
Scott: Yeah, but I mean, that also describes other people, right?

584
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:42,950
Scott: He's his big thing is like the swirliness and like the mistiness.

585
00:30:43,351 --> 00:30:47,930
Rym: Look at those long point on the D hat and the long horn things coming out of his outfit.

586
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:48,910
Rym: Yeah, triangles.

587
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:56,229
Rym: So I watched this movie again once as an older person in like college ish.

588
00:30:56,451 --> 00:30:57,230
Rym: RIT ish time.

589
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:58,343
Scott: Yeah, probably year 2000, I think.

590
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:03,430
Rym: And it's interesting because, well, so the plot is D is fucking invincible.

591
00:31:03,793 --> 00:31:05,270
Rym: He's the son of Dracula.

592
00:31:05,494 --> 00:31:06,230
Rym: Yeah, spoilers.

593
00:31:06,674 --> 00:31:07,830
Rym: He's not a vampire.

594
00:31:08,191 --> 00:31:11,787
Rym: He's a dumpier or as a kid, as I thought from a vampire.

595
00:31:12,752 --> 00:31:15,390
Scott: Thing like vampire powers, but he's not a vampire.

596
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:19,510
Rym: So when I was a kid, all I had to go on was the dub, which wasn't that bad as far as I can remember.

597
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:22,850
Rym: But it sounded like they're saying Vampil.

598
00:31:23,911 --> 00:31:27,670
Scott: So I thought I think there are different dates on which dub or sub you get.

599
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:29,350
Scott: I think it will say something different.

600
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:32,050
Rym: He is a dumpier, but it sounded like Vampil.

601
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:37,570
Rym: So for most of my childhood, I thought that vampire and Vampil were two different things.

602
00:31:37,932 --> 00:31:41,169
Rym: And I just used the word Vampil like, oh, yeah, you didn't know about Vampil's.

603
00:31:41,431 --> 00:31:42,189
Rym: What's wrong with you?

604
00:31:42,911 --> 00:31:47,830
Scott: I thought it was just a stupid thing where they were like, he's just actually a vampire.

605
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:51,290
Scott: But it's like, I'll just change the word slightly and no one will know.

606
00:31:52,393 --> 00:31:53,650
Scott: I'm not Alucard.

607
00:31:53,792 --> 00:31:54,589
Scott: I'm Alucardo.

608
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:57,370
Scott: Yeah, I'll just change the word Dracula slightly.

609
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:58,228
Scott: So you won't know.

610
00:31:58,651 --> 00:32:00,450
Scott: It's sort of like, you know, Clark Kent with the glasses.

611
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:01,527
Scott: I thought that's what it was.

612
00:32:02,115 --> 00:32:02,950
Scott: I'm my first watching.

613
00:32:04,735 --> 00:32:06,610
Rym: So, you know, kind of review this movie.

614
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:08,548
Scott: Then I remembered, oh, Japan made this.

615
00:32:09,051 --> 00:32:12,050
Rym: When I was a kid, a little kid and I watched this movie.

616
00:32:12,852 --> 00:32:19,270
Rym: All I remember really is that Dee was the coolest person I'd ever seen in a movie ever.

617
00:32:20,792 --> 00:32:22,030
Rym: The whole thing was awesome.

618
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:26,950
Rym: The movie felt like it was three, four, five hours long.

619
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:28,930
Rym: Like it felt like it just went on forever.

620
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,789
Rym: I loved every second of it.

621
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:36,310
Rym: I dressed up as Dee, kind of wanted to be Dee as a little kid.

622
00:32:37,151 --> 00:32:41,612
Rym: And I pretty much spent most of my childhood showing this to my friends who would then have.

623
00:32:41,652 --> 00:32:47,048
Rym: their parents would then call my parents, concernedly asking about this like violent cartoon that I had.

624
00:32:48,671 --> 00:32:55,149
Rym: Whenever it was my grandparents house, I would always be like, let's watch Vampire Hunter D. And my grandparents really did not like this movie.

625
00:32:56,630 --> 00:33:00,870
Scott: But watching it a little older, I watched Dumbo with my grandparents house.

626
00:33:00,973 --> 00:33:01,568
Scott: What's wrong with you?

627
00:33:01,893 --> 00:33:02,789
Rym: I also watched Dumbo.

628
00:33:03,413 --> 00:33:04,809
Scott: I pretty much watched Dumbo every time.

629
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:07,850
Rym: But Dumbo and Vampire Hunter D as a kid were just interchangeable.

630
00:33:08,072 --> 00:33:10,330
Rym: And my brother was two and a half years younger than me.

631
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:12,730
Rym: So he was in second grade.

632
00:33:13,494 --> 00:33:14,468
Rym: He loved it just as much.

633
00:33:15,413 --> 00:33:16,688
Rym: And we both turned out totally OK.

634
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:19,188
Scott: But I would not agree with that.

635
00:33:20,092 --> 00:33:22,369
Rym: How did how did Vampire Hunter D mess me up?

636
00:33:23,132 --> 00:33:23,495
Scott: I'm just.

637
00:33:23,777 --> 00:33:25,007
Scott: I'm just saying that you're messed up.

638
00:33:25,431 --> 00:33:25,878
Rym: How so?

639
00:33:25,979 --> 00:33:26,749
Rym: How am I messed up?

640
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:28,268
Scott: You are messed up in so many ways.

641
00:33:29,052 --> 00:33:30,328
Scott: You are the most messed up.

642
00:33:30,795 --> 00:33:31,649
Rym: I am the most messed up.

643
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:33,170
Rym: I think we can name more messed up people.

644
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:35,849
Scott: I mean, yeah, you're not that guy, but you're messed up.

645
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:36,425
Scott: How so?

646
00:33:36,851 --> 00:33:38,009
Scott: I was really messed up.

647
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:39,150
Rym: Yeah, let me count the ways.

648
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:40,210
Scott: Let me count the ways.

649
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:47,210
Scott: If Rym finds a noise that annoys you, he will make that noise repeatedly until you are so annoyed because he is not a good person.

650
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:49,429
Scott: That is one way in which you are messed up.

651
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:50,850
Rym: Two, that's just my superpower.

652
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:54,390
Scott: You will live dangerously and risk death for stupid reasons.

653
00:33:54,430 --> 00:34:03,570
Rym: I love how you think it's dangerously to like bike 20 miles an hour in a separate separated bikeway to go skiing at all.

654
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:05,150
Rym: Skiing is not that dangerous.

655
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:05,855
Scott: Dangerous.

656
00:34:05,896 --> 00:34:06,548
Rym: Actually, it's not.

657
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:08,349
Rym: Yes, no, it really isn't.

658
00:34:08,632 --> 00:34:10,449
Scott: Also lying a lot just about things.

659
00:34:10,951 --> 00:34:11,638
Rym: About what?

660
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:12,850
Rym: What have I ever lied about?

661
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:13,889
Scott: So many things.

662
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:15,250
Rym: Like name one thing I've ever lied about.

663
00:34:15,351 --> 00:34:16,027
Scott: So much lying.

664
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:21,929
Rym: OK, there's one thing that I didn't lie about, but Scott lied on my behalf.

665
00:34:22,635 --> 00:34:23,870
Scott: I never lied about anything ever.

666
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:31,547
Rym: You were convinced and even argued with me that I had seen the second Matrix movie in the theater with you.

667
00:34:34,293 --> 00:34:40,130
Rym: When I, in fact, not only had not, but have to this day never seen that movie.

668
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:41,929
Scott: Well, that is a good thing for you.

669
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,119
Scott: Maybe that is if you.

670
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:46,347
Scott: maybe if you watch it, though, it would cancel out your messed up and un-mess you up.

671
00:34:46,949 --> 00:34:49,829
Scott: But anyway, is that movie will mess you the fuck up as a kid?

672
00:34:50,351 --> 00:34:50,532
Rym: Like.

673
00:34:50,693 --> 00:34:53,330
Rym: I think that it's interesting from a kid perspective.

674
00:34:53,812 --> 00:35:01,630
Rym: It's like, you know, watching Dragon Ball, like there's certain kinds of shows where you watch it and you're engaged in what seems like an epic struggle.

675
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:14,710
Rym: But as an adult in college, when I watched it again, I realized something very profound about this movie that literally escaped my notice as a child, despite watching it like a hundred times.

676
00:35:16,091 --> 00:35:20,410
Rym: There is no struggle or conflict at all in this movie.

677
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:21,674
Scott: The movie is.

678
00:35:21,714 --> 00:35:24,290
Scott: my vague memory is that this D he's awesome.

679
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:26,150
Scott: His hand talks to him, which is the best part.

680
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:28,450
Rym: The dub voice for his hand was actually pretty.

681
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:30,710
Scott: I mean, just the fact that his hand talks to him is the best part.

682
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,045
Rym: And his hand is kind of a dick.

683
00:35:32,248 --> 00:35:32,450
Scott: Right.

684
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:33,990
Scott: Yes, the hand is the best character.

685
00:35:34,892 --> 00:35:36,529
Scott: The hand has more lines than anyone else, too.

686
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:38,870
Rym: As a kid, I was obsessed with what the deal was with the hand.

687
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:40,049
Rym: And of course, the movie doesn't tell you.

688
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:42,890
Scott: He meets this girl somehow and he stays in her house.

689
00:35:43,571 --> 00:35:43,975
Rym: That's true.

690
00:35:43,995 --> 00:35:45,209
Scott: I don't know if he's guarding her.

691
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,143
Scott: Well, I don't remember.

692
00:35:46,183 --> 00:35:46,470
Scott: All right.

693
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:46,832
Rym: Let's see.

694
00:35:46,913 --> 00:35:50,970
Scott: And then Dracula lives in a castle nearby and he just lives in the girl's house for a while.

695
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:52,079
Scott: I think there's a few lines.

696
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,210
Scott: It's not actually Dracula.

697
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:55,810
Rym: It's Count Magnus D. That's not Dracula.

698
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:56,417
Scott: Whatever.

699
00:35:56,457 --> 00:35:57,108
Scott: I don't give a shit.

700
00:35:57,491 --> 00:35:58,609
Rym: And you could say it's a Dracula.

701
00:35:59,174 --> 00:35:59,709
Scott: I don't remember.

702
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:02,150
Scott: This is why I'm going by my memory, not the truth.

703
00:36:03,532 --> 00:36:06,330
Scott: And then it's just like a lot of time passes.

704
00:36:06,613 --> 00:36:08,470
Scott: And then he goes and kills Dracula.

705
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:08,994
Scott: The end.

706
00:36:09,014 --> 00:36:10,148
Scott: Yeah.

707
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:16,128
Rym: So she basically Count Magnus Lee wants this girl to be his next wife, because that's just what he does.

708
00:36:17,152 --> 00:36:20,770
Rym: And the vampires kind of just live in this horrible vampire world.

709
00:36:20,871 --> 00:36:22,870
Rym: And there's also like werewolf hunters.

710
00:36:23,071 --> 00:36:26,850
Rym: He just happens to be a vampire hunter and he has a robot horse.

711
00:36:27,033 --> 00:36:27,990
Rym: And it's like a nuclear.

712
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:28,801
Rym: The robot horse.

713
00:36:31,372 --> 00:36:33,649
Scott: Not as cool as the talking hand, but still cool.

714
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:40,110
Rym: The thing that resonated both as a kid and an adult for Vampire Hunter D is that it's one of those movies that does the thing very well.

715
00:36:40,171 --> 00:36:41,289
Scott: Not as good as Rau's horse.

716
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:43,070
Rym: Like Cowboy Bebop also does.

717
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:45,730
Rym: Similar style horse, though, in a lot of ways.

718
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,810
Scott: It would definitely lose in a fight.

719
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:48,471
Rym: Yeah.

720
00:36:48,492 --> 00:36:49,730
Rym: Well, of course it would.

721
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:50,457
Rym: It's from Asher.

722
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:51,548
Rym: I mean, it's just no.

723
00:36:53,131 --> 00:36:58,449
Rym: So is that it has this crazy setting with a whole bunch of stuff going on.

724
00:36:59,090 --> 00:36:59,594
Rym: And it that.

725
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:01,410
Rym: but that stuff is not the plot.

726
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:03,090
Rym: See, also Cowboy Bebop.

727
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:08,570
Rym: That is one of the signs of a good where you have a good world and you have a story in that world.

728
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:13,530
Rym: But the story doesn't have to be about that world resolving the world stuff.

729
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:15,989
Rym: Just have it in the background, have it there.

730
00:37:16,711 --> 00:37:18,730
Rym: But anyway, so all this happens.

731
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:25,250
Rym: She hires Vampire Hunter D to be your bodyguard because Count Magnus Lee is going to come back.

732
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:27,748
Rym: He better and take her away and make her a vampire wife.

733
00:37:29,231 --> 00:37:38,990
Rym: Uh, D then just walks from challenge to challenge, trivially dispatching them, because literally he is just more powerful than everyone.

734
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:45,429
Rym: The big plot at the end and to spoil it for you is that he just walks into Magnus Lee's castle to fuck him up.

735
00:37:46,011 --> 00:37:48,589
Rym: And Magnus Lee is like, oh, I have a thing that will stop you.

736
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:51,670
Rym: And then he's just like, actually, no, I'm too powerful.

737
00:37:51,951 --> 00:37:52,922
Rym: That and just kills him.

738
00:37:53,064 --> 00:37:53,428
Rym: The end.

739
00:37:54,954 --> 00:38:00,990
Rym: Uh, like literally every fight is just D being like, I'm actually just more powerful than you and just killing whatever it is he's fighting.

740
00:38:02,531 --> 00:38:06,170
Rym: It's interesting to me that I did not notice that as a kid and only noticed it as an adult.

741
00:38:07,174 --> 00:38:08,450
Rym: I still think it's worth watching.

742
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:10,129
Scott: When I was a kid, I thought He-Man was the best.

743
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:16,670
Rym: So I just noticed Vampire Hunter D on Anime News Network under the category objectionable content.

744
00:38:17,396 --> 00:38:18,228
Rym: It has one word.

745
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:19,783
Rym: Intense.

746
00:38:21,196 --> 00:38:31,390
Rym: This is a movie where D cuts people in half and the intricate details of the viscera spilling forth are drawn to a degree that is surprising.

747
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:32,728
Scott: There's also a sexy shower scene.

748
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:37,390
Rym: Yeah, which I didn't see as a kid because they cut that out of the sci-fi channel airing.

749
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:44,429
Rym: So I didn't see it until I was much older, as in I was like 12 instead of nine.

750
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:59,058
Rym: And I remember when they cut the shower scene out, it basically just went from D's, like she goes in to take a shower, D's sitting there being very uncomfortable and suddenly it's the next day and there's all this drama between the two of them

751
00:39:00,082 --> 00:39:00,323
Scott: and

752
00:39:00,965 --> 00:39:02,090
Rym: never really understood that.

753
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:06,069
Rym: And then when I saw the shower scene, I was like, oh, OK, that makes sense now.

754
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:11,390
Rym: I think this movie is actually pretty good from an anime movie perspective.

755
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:15,370
Scott: I mean, you can watch it just to see the talking hand and the Yoshitaka Amano artwork.

756
00:39:15,631 --> 00:39:17,018
Scott: Yeah, like it's a set piece, it's 80 minutes long.

757
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:23,790
Scott: And it's important anime history-wise, so if you care about anime, it's important to see it.

758
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:24,522
Rym: Because remember, this was...

759
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:32,210
Scott: It's not like a Satoshi Kon or an Akira level or a Miyazaki level or anything like that.

760
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:36,810
Rym: It's unique because it's pretty different from most of the anime that a lot of people see.

761
00:39:37,712 --> 00:39:40,069
Rym: There's not a lot of other anime that's really like it.

762
00:39:40,571 --> 00:39:44,730
Rym: And a lot of the other anime in this sort of like OAV era is just garbage.

763
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:53,710
Rym: This one actually has enough going on, despite a utterly ridiculously simplistic plot, that it's kind of worth watching.

764
00:39:54,270 --> 00:40:01,210
Rym: And it's also worth noting that it was the second anime to be shown in the sci-fi channel-like anime thing.

765
00:40:01,651 --> 00:40:06,630
Rym: that was literally the sole reason an entire generation of anime fans appeared in America.

766
00:40:07,231 --> 00:40:16,630
Scott: I think a generation of anime fans appeared in America also because of the syndication of Battleship Yamato, which was known as Star Blazers, and also Robotech.

767
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:19,470
Rym: I did not say there were not other generations of anime fans.

768
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:20,349
Scott: And also Toonami.

769
00:40:21,071 --> 00:40:24,270
Rym: But the thing that they showed right before this was Robot Carnival.

770
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:25,042
Scott: Yup.

771
00:40:25,852 --> 00:40:28,589
Rym: I only caught the end of it because I tuned in to watch Vampire Hunter D.

772
00:40:30,231 --> 00:40:33,070
Scott: Anyway, so Gundam The Origin.

773
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:34,789
Scott: I think I've talked about this in the show before.

774
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:38,790
Scott: Maybe I even geek-bited it like in the opening part, but I've never made it the main bit.

775
00:40:39,172 --> 00:40:43,370
Scott: And Rym hasn't read it yet, but it's so good, it cannot be delayed any longer.

776
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,569
Scott: It must be discussed, even if we're repeating it.

777
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:49,910
Rym: I think, do I just need to borrow the earlier issues of it and just read it?

778
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:53,110
Scott: Yeah, so it's like, it cannot be delayed.

779
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:57,390
Scott: Even if I'm repeating everything I've said before, which I feel like I might be, it doesn't matter.

780
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:58,047
Scott: It is worth it.

781
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:58,990
Scott: So Gundam The Origin.

782
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,010
Scott: What is Gundam The Origin?

783
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:05,130
Scott: It is a manga that has been done more recently than the original Gundam.

784
00:41:05,771 --> 00:41:09,310
Scott: However, it is telling the story of the original Gundam.

785
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:12,970
Scott: The original Gundam story that is in the novel and the original anime series.

786
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:14,510
Scott: First Gundam, right?

787
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:24,110
Scott: Gundam 78, Universal Century with Amuro and Char and Bright Noah and all the original Gundam story in manga form.

788
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:31,730
Scott: Now, usually when something is redone in another medium later on, it's not as good as the original, right?

789
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:37,350
Scott: You're not going to want to read like, you know, the Star Wars manga, the Star Wars manga.

790
00:41:38,293 --> 00:41:39,670
Scott: The Star Wars manga is a special thing.

791
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:41,350
Scott: When I talk about like a straight redoing, right?

792
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:45,630
Scott: I mean, as good as Lord of the Rings movie is, it's not Lord of the Rings book, right?

793
00:41:46,071 --> 00:41:52,110
Scott: As good as, you know, I mean, there's Star Wars novels that are literally just retellings of original Star Wars movie.

794
00:41:52,191 --> 00:41:54,090
Rym: I read the episode four novel, right?

795
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:56,970
Scott: Not the same as episode four itself, right?

796
00:41:57,031 --> 00:41:57,810
Scott: It's not quite there.

797
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:02,050
Scott: So usually it's like, you know, usually it's an anime adaptation of a manga.

798
00:42:02,533 --> 00:42:04,050
Scott: It's like you just go for the manga.

799
00:42:04,211 --> 00:42:07,170
Scott: You don't need to watch the anime adaptation of the manga, right?

800
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:07,849
Scott: You can skip that.

801
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:12,126
Scott: So you think, oh, it's a manga adaptation of this old, classic, amazing anime.

802
00:42:12,146 --> 00:42:13,350
Scott: that's super important, Gundam.

803
00:42:14,353 --> 00:42:15,450
Scott: Why would anyone give a shit?

804
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:24,410
Scott: Well, is a rare case where the manga redo of a thing is the best possible version of the thing.

805
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:25,491
Scott: It is the.

806
00:42:25,591 --> 00:42:39,830
Scott: if you want to know the story of the original Gundam, the first Gundam, this is the best version of that story in any medium, better than novel, better than the movie compilation movies, better than the anime series.

807
00:42:40,111 --> 00:42:41,610
Rym: Even with not having any music?

808
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:43,168
Scott: Better than all those.

809
00:42:43,791 --> 00:42:48,490
Scott: It is the best telling of that story in any medium that has ever existed, right?

810
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:55,910
Scott: So, first of all, the art is the greatest art that has ever existed for Gundam.

811
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:59,890
Rym: Wow, you had you really you brought that back around because I was about to be like Akira.

812
00:43:01,871 --> 00:43:04,190
Scott: It is the best Gundam art, right?

813
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:06,170
Rym: That is best at Gundam.

814
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:07,270
Scott: Sure.

815
00:43:08,672 --> 00:43:12,230
Scott: The artist, right, is like always keep forgetting his name.

816
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:13,709
Scott: It's Yasuhiko something, I think.

817
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:14,366
Scott: Yes.

818
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:15,561
Scott: Yeah.

819
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:17,250
Scott: Yoshikazu Yasuhiko.

820
00:43:17,371 --> 00:43:19,810
Scott: People I always just see, you know, Yasuhiko, whatever, right?

821
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:23,270
Scott: This guy, this art is just like incredible.

822
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:33,650
Scott: Somehow he's managed to keep the original designs of the characters and things, but also things are changed in ways like only a nerd would notice, like everything is still recognizable.

823
00:43:33,931 --> 00:43:39,930
Scott: Like if you look at, say, a Zaku, you look at it and say it's undeniably Zaku, you know, it's it's so iconic.

824
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:47,150
Scott: But then if you actually line it up next to one from like the old anime series, it's like, wow, look at look at.

825
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:54,921
Scott: The changes that were made here, but somehow for the better without losing any of, you know, the original design.

826
00:43:54,962 --> 00:43:56,804
Scott: that makes it what it is, you know, it's.

827
00:43:56,985 --> 00:43:59,128
Scott: it's to the point where it's like I bought.

828
00:43:59,148 --> 00:44:00,530
Scott: you can buy a Gundam model.

829
00:44:01,411 --> 00:44:05,830
Scott: It's a special Gundam, the origin model, as opposed to a original Gundam model.

830
00:44:06,232 --> 00:44:09,489
Scott: And you put them next to each other and it's like, oh, there are differences here.

831
00:44:10,071 --> 00:44:14,249
Scott: But if you looked at anyone on its own, only a nerd would be able to tell you which one was which.

832
00:44:14,672 --> 00:44:18,190
Rym: I think we saw a bunch of those nerds at that awesome Gundam panel at Anime Boston.

833
00:44:18,951 --> 00:44:21,010
Rym: Probably those people would have recognized.

834
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:26,710
Scott: The other thing is that not only does it tell the original Gundam story, but it makes some very small changes.

835
00:44:27,572 --> 00:44:30,929
Scott: But those changes are most are almost universally for the better.

836
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:32,730
Rym: Universally century?

837
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:48,764
Scott: No, they're just universally like good, positive, you know, small changes to like facts and they close some plot holes or, you know, provide clarity to things that used to be sort of vague and not 100 percent, you know, totally clear what happened.

838
00:44:49,805 --> 00:44:55,650
Scott: or, you know, really spend some more time on a character, you know, because it's a manga and they can do that.

839
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:56,072
Scott: And they don't.

840
00:44:56,092 --> 00:45:00,190
Scott: they're not limited to the 30 minutes of air time you get in an anime or 20 something minutes.

841
00:45:00,712 --> 00:45:00,994
Scott: Right.

842
00:45:01,014 --> 00:45:04,450
Scott: So it's like, you know, you don't have this sort of like, oh, the character is there for two seconds.

843
00:45:04,571 --> 00:45:07,730
Scott: It's like, no, it's like full, you know, everything.

844
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:11,470
Scott: Everything is as much time as it needs without getting too much time.

845
00:45:11,891 --> 00:45:14,770
Scott: There's a lot of color pages, which is kind of amazing.

846
00:45:15,731 --> 00:45:19,250
Scott: The color pages are like with the watercolor, the way it's amazing.

847
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:21,370
Rym: I flipped through this thing like I haven't read it yet.

848
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:21,975
Rym: I should.

849
00:45:22,015 --> 00:45:22,519
Rym: I'm going to.

850
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,709
Rym: I'm going to take Scott's and read it.

851
00:45:24,071 --> 00:45:26,270
Rym: But I was flipping through it and Scott's not exaggerating.

852
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:27,610
Rym: Like it is beautiful to behold.

853
00:45:27,851 --> 00:45:28,173
Scott: It's like.

854
00:45:28,455 --> 00:45:30,930
Scott: it's like, is this an art book or is this a manga?

855
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:32,308
Scott: It's like, whoa, what's going on here?

856
00:45:34,453 --> 00:45:36,310
Scott: And it doesn't skip over anything, right?

857
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:38,190
Scott: It's like it's a lot of volumes of this.

858
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:42,730
Scott: It just keeps going and doesn't, you know, leave anything untouched.

859
00:45:42,891 --> 00:45:47,330
Scott: It is it is like a complete set, you know, as you're not missing anything.

860
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:56,250
Scott: The way a compilation movie will sort of gloss over the less important things, you know, and focus only on the important part of the story is just like, no, the full story.

861
00:45:56,390 --> 00:46:03,770
Rym: I've heard other people, not just me, analogize it to that evangelical manga in the sense that I haven't read evangelical manga.

862
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:04,214
Scott: So I don't know.

863
00:46:04,275 --> 00:46:05,669
Rym: I read the first chunk of it.

864
00:46:05,851 --> 00:46:16,194
Rym: And I would describe it a lot of the ways you've described this, that it takes Ava, the anime, and it just kind of moves at a slower narrative pace so that it doesn't gloss over anything.

865
00:46:16,254 --> 00:46:18,370
Scott: It doesn't feel like Gun of the Origin moves slow.

866
00:46:18,853 --> 00:46:20,630
Scott: It feels like it moves exactly right.

867
00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:29,570
Rym: Like cover all the bases and keep, you know, I guess like it doesn't skip things that were skipped in the anime and would definitely be skipped in the compilation.

868
00:46:30,010 --> 00:46:32,230
Rym: And it also like it fills in a lot of details.

869
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:37,970
Rym: Like you see a little more like why was Kaji doing what he was doing and what was this person up to at this time?

870
00:46:38,171 --> 00:46:40,249
Rym: So it makes sense later when some other things happen.

871
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:49,250
Scott: The other thing that it does is, you know, it adds in without changing anything, stories that were just not told in the original.

872
00:46:49,371 --> 00:46:49,511
Scott: Right.

873
00:46:49,531 --> 00:46:54,074
Scott: It's like you learn there's like this whole chapters of like history of Char and from way back.

874
00:46:54,476 --> 00:46:57,950
Scott: And it like it's sort of like the true story of what happened there.

875
00:46:58,311 --> 00:47:02,790
Scott: But that was never really included in a lot of the previous tellings of the story.

876
00:47:03,392 --> 00:47:17,090
Scott: So it's like, you know, the most important characters, their back story is getting revealed and fully fleshed out, whereas before it was sort of known or not given screen time at all or, you know, skipped over or who knows what.

877
00:47:17,590 --> 00:47:21,972
Scott: But now you're getting the full story in regards to those sorts of things that wasn't there before.

878
00:47:21,992 --> 00:47:31,430
Scott: So that's real important because if you watch like original Gundam anime, you're not going to know that at all because it wasn't touched on.

879
00:47:32,052 --> 00:47:35,487
Scott: But here it's completely explained in full detail, 100 percent.

880
00:47:37,511 --> 00:47:43,111
Scott: So, yeah, this is if you even if you are a person who's like, oh, like robots and whatever.

881
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:43,332
Scott: Right.

882
00:47:43,372 --> 00:47:51,806
Scott: Well, because it's a manga, you don't really have that robot fight sort of action scene where it's like, you know, they're just.

883
00:47:51,866 --> 00:47:56,210
Scott: I mean, it's still there where the people are talking while they're fighting and robots, but it's not like.

884
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:59,810
Scott: there's pages and pages of just robots shooting each other and nothing going on.

885
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:00,071
Scott: Right.

886
00:48:00,111 --> 00:48:05,613
Scott: It's like when there's a battle, it's like the battle really just serves as illustrations.

887
00:48:06,275 --> 00:48:11,898
Scott: And, you know, this the speech bubbles and text, the dialog that people are saying is on top of it.

888
00:48:11,978 --> 00:48:18,230
Scott: So you're not getting this sort of same thing happens in the anime where it's like talk, boom, fight slash talk.

889
00:48:19,197 --> 00:48:20,130
Scott: It's it's simultaneous.

890
00:48:20,672 --> 00:48:23,490
Scott: So even if you're like, oh, robot battles are boring.

891
00:48:23,691 --> 00:48:27,410
Scott: It's like, well, here you're just looking at illustrations while the plot continues.

892
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:32,665
Rym: It's almost like the human drama and the horror of war is the story of Gundam and not the robots themselves.

893
00:48:32,726 --> 00:48:32,969
Scott: Yes.

894
00:48:33,131 --> 00:48:47,138
Scott: But I mean, there are a lot of people who are like anti robot, you know, it's like, well, now you can get the story of Gundam with basically skipping over robot, but not if you care about robot, though, you're not missing out at all because they're still fully illustrated robot

895
00:48:47,319 --> 00:48:47,781
Rym: battles

896
00:48:47,861 --> 00:48:49,570
Scott: and details about robots.

897
00:48:49,751 --> 00:48:53,938
Scott: And they talk about like, oh, improving the thing with this fire in the low and greens or whatever.

898
00:48:53,959 --> 00:48:54,081
Scott: Yeah.

899
00:48:54,163 --> 00:48:54,489
Scott: All that.

900
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:55,337
Scott: Well, there's no long.

901
00:48:55,438 --> 00:48:56,489
Rym: I know that's in Gundam.

902
00:48:58,052 --> 00:49:00,850
Scott: Yeah, but, you know, all the military fanboy stuff is there, too.

903
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:05,250
Scott: But it's like it'll be like, you know, the captain will give some orders and then that's it.

904
00:49:05,713 --> 00:49:08,790
Scott: You know, it's not like they dwell on anything for too long.

905
00:49:09,591 --> 00:49:15,014
Scott: You know, everything is just so perfectly given the right amount of panels and time and everything.

906
00:49:15,034 --> 00:49:17,410
Scott: It's just so good.

907
00:49:18,112 --> 00:49:21,070
Scott: It's like you don't really need any other Gundam if you read this manga.

908
00:49:21,752 --> 00:49:23,781
Scott: And the translation is I can't.

909
00:49:23,801 --> 00:49:25,810
Scott: I can't compare it to the Japanese, obviously.

910
00:49:26,611 --> 00:49:35,789
Scott: But as far as I can tell, it's like I have no desire to you know, it doesn't feel like anything was like confusing or mistranslated or worded.

911
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:40,491
Scott: Strangely, it's like it feels like it was written in native English, as far as I can tell.

912
00:49:41,194 --> 00:49:47,410
Scott: There's like, you know, it's not like this, you know, especially in a sci fi story like this takes place in a future in space.

913
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:58,793
Scott: You know, you don't get sort of the Japanese culture entering into it in the way you would in something like, I don't know, what's a very Japanese, even Yamato to a degree.

914
00:49:58,854 --> 00:49:59,177
Rym: Sure.

915
00:49:59,197 --> 00:50:00,690
Scott: But I mean, like a school anime.

916
00:50:00,851 --> 00:50:00,972
Scott: Right.

917
00:50:00,992 --> 00:50:03,549
Scott: Where the facts of Japanese school life enter into it.

918
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:03,932
Scott: Right.

919
00:50:03,952 --> 00:50:06,370
Scott: You know, that doesn't even come into play.

920
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:07,668
Rym: I sure do like donuts.

921
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:08,534
Scott: Yeah.

922
00:50:08,997 --> 00:50:10,449
Rym: Little triangle shaped donuts.

923
00:50:11,511 --> 00:50:21,970
Scott: So if you're an anime person at all, which you probably are, if you're listening to this and you don't know Gundam, well, it's important to know this is the way to find out is to read this manga.

924
00:50:22,111 --> 00:50:28,190
Scott: And if you are a Gundam fan or robot fan of any kind, mecha fan and you haven't read this, what the hell?

925
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:33,152
Rym: And seriously, even if you don't like like the like Scott said, the anti robot bias is real.

926
00:50:33,293 --> 00:50:36,330
Rym: I mean, as Gaflone is a giant robot anime.

927
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:40,222
Scott: Also, if you're just a person who likes comics, this is like.

928
00:50:40,564 --> 00:50:44,669
Scott: so almost this is like the second tier of comic greatness of all time.

929
00:50:45,412 --> 00:50:49,894
Scott: You know, it's like you got the Tezuka and the eyes of the world and then you got this like right underneath.

930
00:50:51,139 --> 00:50:55,870
Scott: Like I didn't think like something, you know, Gundam, like I always had Gundam is like, you know, it's always solid.

931
00:50:56,132 --> 00:50:57,209
Scott: It's always there for you.

932
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:57,993
Scott: I like it.

933
00:50:58,314 --> 00:51:01,810
Scott: I'm not, you know, ridiculous fan of it, but I really like it a lot.

934
00:51:03,492 --> 00:51:08,149
Scott: But I never thought of it as like the top tier, you know, just super important historically and whatnot.

935
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:18,910
Scott: But this this is like somehow, you know, this franchise that is so much properties built around it is somehow one thing in that franchise is at the top tiers.

936
00:51:19,858 --> 00:51:20,549
Scott: You can't miss that.

937
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:21,910
Rym: It's right up there with my Rattata.

938
00:51:22,971 --> 00:51:24,790
Scott: Rattata is the finest Rattata.

939
00:51:25,371 --> 00:51:25,712
Rym: All right.

940
00:51:26,073 --> 00:51:30,729
Rym: So I guess the moral is read Gundam The Origin and watch Vampire Hunter D.

941
00:51:31,252 --> 00:51:33,790
Scott: I think you should read Gundam The Origin and maybe watch Vampire Hunter D.

942
00:51:34,192 --> 00:51:37,250
Rym: If you've never seen Vampire Hunter D, I would watch it.

943
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:38,390
Rym: It's not that long.

944
00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:44,410
Scott: If you're sitting at home and you got a Vampire Hunter D DVD next to a Gundam The Origin volume, you should be reading that manga first.

945
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:45,489
Rym: Well, just do both.

946
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:46,556
Scott: Who knows?

947
00:51:46,576 --> 00:51:47,110
Scott: I've got time for that.

948
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:48,710
Rym: You've got an hour to listen to a podcast.

949
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:52,270
Scott: You're probably biking to work or driving to work while listening to this.

950
00:51:52,491 --> 00:51:54,750
Rym: Yeah, I would not be biking to work and listening to a podcast.

951
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:56,869
Rym: I don't do that.

952
00:51:57,170 --> 00:51:58,128
Rym: That's that'll kill you.

953
00:51:58,450 --> 00:51:58,697
Rym: Maybe.

954
00:51:58,924 --> 00:51:59,109
Rym: Yeah.

955
00:51:59,716 --> 00:52:01,190
Rym: No, no, I can't.

956
00:52:01,370 --> 00:52:01,612
Rym: I can't.

957
00:52:01,774 --> 00:52:03,229
Rym: I'll tell the anecdote after we stop the show.

958
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,340
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

959
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:16,440
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

960
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:21,882
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

961
00:52:22,124 --> 00:52:24,800
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

962
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:29,540
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

964
00:52:34,361 --> 00:52:37,400
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

965
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:40,480
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
