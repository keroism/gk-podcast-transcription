1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,538
Rym: It's Thursday, October 15th, 2015, Spooky.

2
00:00:15,575 --> 00:00:16,007
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:16,583
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:17,051 --> 00:00:18,409
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:22,210
Rym: Tonight, spookily, we talk about Halloween.

6
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:23,361
Rym: Holy.

7
00:00:25,193 --> 00:00:26,208
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:32,009
Rym: Fun fact, Halloween is actually the official anniversary day of GeekNights.

9
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:34,230
Rym: That's when we published our first episode, legit.

10
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:35,549
Scott: That wasn't a beta episode.

11
00:00:35,871 --> 00:00:36,755
Rym: Yeah, though, fun.

12
00:00:37,438 --> 00:00:55,779
Rym: other fact, we started putting episodes up, starting with the episode like a week after Halloween, but then I finally edited, I was basically going back through the beta episodes, and I decided that October 31st, that we happened to do an episode that day, was the furthest back.

13
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,329
Rym: I could go where episodes were still listenable, so I retconned and put them in the feed.

14
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:11,810
Rym: So we'd recorded that one originally as a beta, sort of, and like I said, but I'll talk about it in a moment, I might make it more accessible for you guys to get the old, old, old beta episodes.

15
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:12,470
Scott: That's so boring.

16
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,630
Scott: That's like just telling everyone the terrible secret of space.

17
00:01:15,431 --> 00:01:16,249
Rym: Well, they'll have to pay.

18
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:17,609
Scott: Oh, you want to make people pay?

19
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:18,370
Rym: Oh, it's going to be Patreon.

20
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:19,788
Rym: I'm not just going to give it to you fuckers.

21
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:25,130
Rym: You're going to subscribe to our Patreon and give us money if you want that business.

22
00:01:25,812 --> 00:01:27,229
Rym: I'm going to trickle them out.

23
00:01:28,011 --> 00:01:29,369
Scott: So I got some opening bits.

24
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,189
Scott: Oh, you got some opening bits?

25
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:34,050
Rym: In fact, those have never been published, so we could license those, not Creative Commons.

26
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:35,810
Scott: I don't know about that.

27
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,750
Scott: I think they say Creative Commons at the end of them in the audio.

28
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:38,709
Rym: There's no way those do.

29
00:01:39,471 --> 00:01:42,610
Rym: Our intro, as you recall, was the song that we sang.

30
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,648
Scott: Have you listened to these?

31
00:01:44,131 --> 00:01:44,510
Rym: Yeah.

32
00:01:44,774 --> 00:01:45,108
Scott: I haven't.

33
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:48,430
Rym: We sang a... Here's a fun fact.

34
00:01:48,631 --> 00:01:49,190
Rym: This isn't meta.

35
00:01:49,532 --> 00:01:50,430
Scott: I don't remember anything.

36
00:01:50,893 --> 00:01:51,002
Rym: We?

37
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:51,750
Rym: No, you don't.

38
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:57,909
Rym: What's the name of the ark that the bad people took down into the Prince of Nothing world and fucked it up?

39
00:01:58,131 --> 00:01:58,464
Scott: The ark?

40
00:01:58,832 --> 00:01:58,921
Rym: Yeah.

41
00:01:59,232 --> 00:01:59,950
Scott: It's called the ark.

42
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:00,830
Scott: Inku Halanes?

43
00:02:02,485 --> 00:02:02,590
Rym: No.

44
00:02:03,852 --> 00:02:04,367
Scott: What's the name?

45
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:05,610
Scott: Isn't that where it landed?

46
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,329
Rym: That's also the name of the ark.

47
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:09,508
Scott: And the people that were on it were the Inku Aroi.

48
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:15,190
Rym: Name any character who is a female in those books.

49
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:16,618
Scott: Esminet?

50
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:17,490
Rym: All right, all right.

51
00:02:17,732 --> 00:02:18,489
Rym: We remember some things.

52
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:20,470
Scott: I forget the other girl, though.

53
00:02:20,853 --> 00:02:22,470
Scott: The one who was a serving girl.

54
00:02:23,132 --> 00:02:24,710
Rym: Yeah, I knew her name.

55
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,350
Rym: You don't remember that shit either.

56
00:02:26,471 --> 00:02:28,730
Rym: So I did, but then my brain said Egwene.

57
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:29,829
Scott: Wrong book.

58
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:30,570
Scott: Wrong book.

59
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:31,829
Rym: Yeah, my brain fucked it up.

60
00:02:31,972 --> 00:02:40,470
Rym: Anyway, so- Oh, so Scott and I, in the beta episodes in the early days of GeekNights, we sang an opening song together for every episode.

61
00:02:40,972 --> 00:02:41,550
Scott: I don't remember this.

62
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:42,169
Scott: You don't remember that?

63
00:02:42,332 --> 00:02:42,969
Rym: You don't remember the song?

64
00:02:43,194 --> 00:02:43,260
Rym: No.

65
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,788
Rym: I could sing it right now, but I almost want to save it for the-.

66
00:02:46,111 --> 00:02:47,390
Scott: I can go listen whenever I want.

67
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,990
Rym: You guys are really fucking lucky.

68
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,490
Rym: We did not decide to keep singing that song as our opening.

69
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:52,209
Rym: That's all I'm saying.

70
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,210
Scott: All right, anyway.

71
00:02:54,131 --> 00:02:55,181
Scott: Oh, is it this one?

72
00:02:57,235 --> 00:02:57,870
Rym: Yes, it's that one.

73
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:58,510
Rym: Scott remembers.

74
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,408
Scott: You remember things.

75
00:03:03,537 --> 00:03:04,370
Scott: All right, opening bit.

76
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:06,689
Scott: So I ordered some stuff on Amazon, like you do.

77
00:03:06,851 --> 00:03:07,990
Rym: Oh, I did too recently.

78
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,889
Scott: And I divided it into two deliveries, like you do.

79
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:10,283
Scott: No.

80
00:03:11,352 --> 00:03:13,190
Scott: And they were supposed to arrive like yesterday.

81
00:03:13,491 --> 00:03:15,449
Scott: So yesterday I get home and there's nothing there.

82
00:03:16,351 --> 00:03:22,690
Scott: And then I check the tracking a little bit later after I eat a salad and watch some TVs or whatever, play some Rocket League.

83
00:03:23,034 --> 00:03:24,130
Scott: And it says delivered.

84
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,349
Scott: So I go to the door and there it is.

85
00:03:25,971 --> 00:03:27,289
Scott: But there's only one box there.

86
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,767
Scott: So I'm like, "Oh, where's box number

87
00:03:28,807 --> 00:03:28,929
Scott: two?".

88
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,687
Scott: So I go back and I check the tracking and it's like, "Box number two delivered

89
00:03:32,788 --> 00:03:33,290
Scott: yesterday.".

90
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:33,577
Scott: I'm like,

91
00:03:33,618 --> 00:03:33,884
Scott: "What?"

92
00:03:35,372 --> 00:03:37,225
Scott: And it says, "Signed for by

93
00:03:37,245 --> 00:03:37,950
Scott: Gabriella."

94
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,114
Scott: And I'm like,

95
00:03:39,195 --> 00:03:40,284
Scott: "Whoa.".

96
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:44,129
Scott: I don't know who Gabriella is and Gabriella is not me.

97
00:03:45,152 --> 00:03:48,430
Rym: I know a Gabby and I don't know any other Gab star people.

98
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:53,310
Scott: So I go to the Amazon chat and I'm like, I mean, there's nothing really in there.

99
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:56,630
Scott: It was like shampoo and a towel and a washcloth.

100
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,950
Rym: It's not like when I ordered like the Marantz or the Countryman or any of that business.

101
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:04,130
Scott: Yeah, I decided to stop because I used to just use my old regular towels for the floor towel.

102
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:08,290
Scott: I actually bought a floor towel that's meant to be a floor towel.

103
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:08,713
Scott: Ooh.

104
00:04:09,151 --> 00:04:09,649
Scott: Yeah, right.

105
00:04:09,891 --> 00:04:10,989
Scott: Anyway, for the bathroom.

106
00:04:11,871 --> 00:04:12,630
Scott: Yeah, that matches.

107
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,690
Scott: Anyway, so I'm like, "Congratulations, thief.

108
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:16,156
Scott: You got a

109
00:04:16,196 --> 00:04:16,500
Scott: towel.".

110
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,529
Rym: But you signed your name for it.

111
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:19,231
Scott: Yeah.

112
00:04:19,332 --> 00:04:23,210
Scott: Anyway, so I go to the chat on Amazon and I'm like, "Yeah, I didn't get this.

113
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,060
Scott: I don't know who this

114
00:04:24,203 --> 00:04:24,304
Scott: is.".

115
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,706
Scott: They're like, "Okay, well, you want us to send you another one or a

116
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:27,090
Scott: refund?".

117
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,848
Scott: I'm like, "Send me another one, but don't you care who this

118
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:30,029
Scott: is?".

119
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,420
Scott: They're like, "Yeah, we'll

120
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:32,247
Scott: investigate.".

121
00:04:33,136 --> 00:04:34,108
Scott: "All right, are you all

122
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:34,290
Scott: set?".

123
00:04:34,351 --> 00:04:35,164
Scott: I'm like, "Yeah, I'm all

124
00:04:35,205 --> 00:04:35,449
Scott: set.".

125
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,690
Scott: And it's like, they don't even give a shit.

126
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,289
Scott: It's like, dude.

127
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:44,330
Scott: Well, you know, there's this interesting problem where like if the other package had something expensive in it, what if it was that one that they had signed for?

128
00:04:44,371 --> 00:04:45,389
Rym: Maybe then they'd care.

129
00:04:46,251 --> 00:04:48,350
Rym: What it comes down to is that's like step back.

130
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:49,695
Rym: You know, we've had things stolen.

131
00:04:50,157 --> 00:05:02,270
Rym: and like when your Xbox and all that was stolen, like the dude fucking logged in with your account, like we had an IP address, it kept logging in, and the detectives gave zero fucks.

132
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:09,070
Scott: Well, he sort of like, he put in like the token effort, like he knew he could do it, but it doesn't seem like he went through with it.

133
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:17,069
Rym: Yeah, but like imagine what our society could be like if there was a way for actual criminal investigation to occur.

134
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,390
Scott: You mean if all the detectives were like Batman?

135
00:05:19,396 --> 00:05:19,830
Rym: Not Batman.

136
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:22,570
Rym: I don't even like break into bars and like break people's fingers.

137
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:25,929
Scott: But I mean, just, you know, this is smart enough to just figure it out and actually do the job.

138
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,149
Rym: You don't need Batman for that.

139
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:30,810
Rym: You just need pretty much ADIQ and up.

140
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,989
Rym: Like it's not rocket science.

141
00:05:34,757 --> 00:05:35,050
Scott: Anyway.

142
00:05:36,351 --> 00:05:39,830
Rym: ADIQ and the most minimal of motivation.

143
00:05:41,993 --> 00:05:44,050
Rym: So in the news, something interesting happened.

144
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:50,249
Rym: You know, there's a lot of stuff you're going to see Thursday episodes, especially a lot of things that are a little bit older coming up.

145
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:53,410
Rym: One, because GeekNights, we've never claimed to be timely.

146
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:54,929
Rym: You shouldn't be getting your news for us.

147
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,229
Rym: You're getting commentary from us.

148
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,310
Rym: And two, I was in Australia and Singapore and Hong Kong for like three and a half weeks.

149
00:06:00,671 --> 00:06:05,250
Rym: So a lot of stuff happened that I didn't get to talk about publicly with all you people.

150
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:11,650
Rym: And one of those things that a lot of you might not have noticed, Kickstarter is now a benefit corporation.

151
00:06:12,195 --> 00:06:13,669
Scott: I didn't know that this was a thing.

152
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,926
Scott: Nor did I. But now I know.

153
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:22,489
Rym: So apparently the gist of this is right now there are, if you think of corporations, you usually think of two kinds.

154
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,547
Scott: There's either the S Corp, C Corp, LLC.

155
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:28,570
Rym: If you're sole proprietorship, you might know more than the average bear.

156
00:06:29,372 --> 00:06:32,650
Rym: If you're not Yogi, you're just an average bear.

157
00:06:33,251 --> 00:06:34,929
Rym: There's for profit companies.

158
00:06:35,531 --> 00:06:37,229
Rym: There's nonprofit companies.

159
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:45,310
Rym: A lot of you, especially GeekNights listeners might know this because your anime convention is probably a nonprofit and they probably have a badly written charter.

160
00:06:45,431 --> 00:06:50,801
Rym: And that's why when you want to do something cool, some lawyer says, "Oh, we can't do that or we'll lose our nonprofit

161
00:06:50,821 --> 00:06:51,205
Rym: status.".

162
00:06:52,354 --> 00:06:55,390
Rym: And that's why a lot of other conventions are for profits.

163
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:56,508
Rym: They don't have to worry about that.

164
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:09,990
Rym: But a PBC is interesting because the problem with corporations, especially for profit corporations, is that legally their duty is to the shareholders to maximize their value.

165
00:07:10,411 --> 00:07:28,050
Rym: So if Scott and I ran Rym and Scott Corp and we had stock or we had investors and we decided to raise salaries for our employees because we're good people and we want them to have living wages, the shareholders could sue us for not executing our fiduciary duty and maximizing their value.

166
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,570
Scott: We work for the company that they invested.

167
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:34,490
Scott: We run the shit and they're suing us because we're not making that.

168
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,970
Scott: We could be giving them more money instead of our employees.

169
00:07:37,131 --> 00:07:46,210
Scott: We'd have to prove to them that actually giving our employees more money is resulting in them getting more money because it means we can hire better employees which results in more profits.

170
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:50,269
Scott: And if we can't prove that, then they'll sue us.

171
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:53,150
Rym: Never mind the fact that corporations count as people.

172
00:07:53,910 --> 00:08:01,230
Rym: So corporations are basically immortal psychotic sociopaths that live forever siphoning money.

173
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:06,442
Scott: The thing I don't understand is, if you look at the history of corporations in America, there used to be very few of them.

174
00:08:06,482 --> 00:08:07,510
Scott: They used to be very limited.

175
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,930
Scott: They used to only exist for a short period of time.

176
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:12,930
Scott: Like the "build this railroad from here to here" corporation.

177
00:08:13,031 --> 00:08:15,950
Scott: It exists to build this railroad from here to here and then it's gone.

178
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:21,370
Scott: It was a very limited thing that had a purpose and then it sort of blew out of proportion.

179
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:26,770
Scott: But why is there any other kind of corporation besides public benefit corporation?

180
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,290
Scott: Why should the for-profit corporation even exist?

181
00:08:29,731 --> 00:08:31,190
Rym: "Be suffered to exist" is what I would say.

182
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:31,669
Rym: And you know what?

183
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:36,770
Rym: Turns out Scott and I are actually pretty left on the scale of politics.

184
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:50,230
Rym: And I'm very much... I mean, I've said a tweet about this, but basically it's okay to me if two different video game companies are trying to compete with each other for profits.

185
00:08:50,491 --> 00:08:51,509
Rym: I don't really care that much.

186
00:08:52,351 --> 00:08:57,850
Rym: But two health insurance companies, profit should not be motivator number one.

187
00:08:58,051 --> 00:09:02,929
Rym: Motivator number one should be providing that service and paying all your employees a reasonable wage.

188
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:11,610
Rym: So the fact that Kickstarter did this... And it's cool because basically they had to go to all their investors and shareholders and everyone.

189
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:14,909
Scott: It's easy enough to start as one of these from the get-go.

190
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:21,970
Scott: But to switch to being one of these, if you have some jerk-ass shareholder, they'll sue you if you try.

191
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,810
Rym: Yeah, but apparently the vote was unanimous.

192
00:09:26,073 --> 00:09:28,190
Scott: Because it's not like it was traded on Nike, right?

193
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:32,470
Scott: It's like the only people who had shares of Kickstarter were probably cool people.

194
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,990
Scott: They probably weren't selling them to anybody.

195
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,450
Rym: But there's a lot more going on here.

196
00:09:36,274 --> 00:09:38,390
Rym: But one, read this because this is really cool.

197
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,962
Rym: And I think more people need to realize that.

198
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:40,950
Rym: one, this is an option.

199
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:41,850
Rym: Two, this happened.

200
00:09:42,731 --> 00:09:48,770
Rym: And also, I have a lot of respect for Kickstarter now because this is basically my dream.

201
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:55,250
Rym: If I owned 100% a big game company, I always wanted it to be a straight up non-profit if I had to.

202
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:59,850
Scott: I would want a company where all employees are equal at the company.

203
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,330
Scott: Everyone owns an equal share and everything, right?

204
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:06,270
Rym: Well, it depends because you might hire someone who's good at doing the company stuff.

205
00:10:06,612 --> 00:10:10,130
Rym: But you wouldn't want them to have, say, other levels of control.

206
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,390
Rym: They might be bad and other things.

207
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,850
Scott: I'll let the janitor have, you know, I'm good.

208
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:13,990
Rym: Yeah, he can have a share.

209
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,270
Scott: So you want to hear a related interesting news?

210
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:16,459
Scott: Who?

211
00:10:16,651 --> 00:10:18,730
Scott: So Square, the swipey payment company.

212
00:10:19,092 --> 00:10:20,308
Rym: Oh, yeah, yeah.

213
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:23,050
Scott: So they're going public or they're trying to-ish, right?

214
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,630
Scott: And that's, I don't know, I can't give investment advice.

215
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,630
Scott: It's not the worst investment.

216
00:10:27,283 --> 00:10:27,410
Rym: Yeah.

217
00:10:27,712 --> 00:10:28,730
Scott: They're a successful business.

218
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:33,710
Rym: I actually learned a lot about them recently because I didn't know how they were handling the chip stuff and like the new terminals.

219
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:37,490
Rym: And actually the way they're handling it is way better than I thought.

220
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,790
Scott: But anyway, so they're going public.

221
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:45,570
Scott: And in the document of like, you know, because you make all these documents and you go public and it's like risks, right?

222
00:10:46,274 --> 00:10:49,389
Scott: And one of the risks on their going public sheet, you know what it says?

223
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:49,988
Rym: What does it say?

224
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:55,710
Scott: Well, the risk, I don't know the exact words they used, but it's basically like, look, we have a risk of going public.

225
00:10:56,472 --> 00:10:58,730
Scott: Some of our employees have a lot of shares.

226
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:05,250
Scott: And if we go public at our current valuation, they will become so mega rich, they'll probably just fucking leave.

227
00:11:05,912 --> 00:11:08,210
Scott: And that would just tank the company without those employees.

228
00:11:10,351 --> 00:11:14,207
Scott: And that makes me like Square if it has the kind of people who will just leave like I would.

229
00:11:15,855 --> 00:11:16,889
Scott: And now it's like Square.

230
00:11:18,191 --> 00:11:20,490
Scott: If you call me up, maybe I'll actually talk to you on the phone.

231
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:21,569
Scott: I'm like every other company.

232
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:21,992
Scott: Yeah.

233
00:11:22,013 --> 00:11:22,769
Rym: See, also Kickstarter.

234
00:11:23,051 --> 00:11:25,210
Scott: I'm actually like, but I got to get in on some of those shares.

235
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:25,908
Scott: I don't need too many.

236
00:11:26,772 --> 00:11:28,490
Scott: I'll take a lot less than everyone else's got.

237
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:28,945
Scott: Just a few.

238
00:11:29,894 --> 00:11:29,998
Scott: Like

239
00:11:29,998 --> 00:11:30,719
Scott: 10. 10

240
00:11:30,719 --> 00:11:30,929
Scott: is good.

241
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,489
Scott: You know, just enough that I don't have to work.

242
00:11:32,832 --> 00:11:33,570
Scott: Like all I want.

243
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:35,590
Scott: I don't need the yacht out of a game company.

244
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:38,890
Rym: Like I would if I if I had that cash out, I wouldn't go 100 percent to the beach.

245
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:42,350
Rym: But what I would do is basically form a company to make cool things.

246
00:11:42,992 --> 00:11:51,590
Rym: And as long as it just paid everyone enough money who worked at it to live in New York, about at the level that we live in New York right now, like I'd run that forever.

247
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,529
Rym: I've made extra profits.

248
00:11:53,111 --> 00:11:58,270
Rym: I'd use that money either to charity or to make games that won't be popular that I want.

249
00:11:59,090 --> 00:11:59,290
Rym: Like that.

250
00:11:59,671 --> 00:12:00,949
Rym: Like imagine if we had money like that.

251
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:03,930
Rym: Like, let's just make, you know, buy the license and make advance wars.

252
00:12:04,353 --> 00:12:04,885
Rym: Go for it.

253
00:12:05,331 --> 00:12:05,947
Rym: Hire all those people.

254
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,830
Scott: But I mean, the thing is, you look at people who own a company of that scale.

255
00:12:09,238 --> 00:12:09,470
Scott: Right.

256
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:10,349
Scott: Like Penny Arcade.

257
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:11,970
Scott: They're still drawing comics.

258
00:12:12,051 --> 00:12:13,868
Scott: Why don't they just go to the beach and be like, fuck you.

259
00:12:14,371 --> 00:12:15,429
Rym: I think I'll go to PAX.

260
00:12:15,951 --> 00:12:19,710
Rym: And I think I think they enjoy doing those things for now.

261
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:25,829
Scott: Still, I mean, honestly, like every like three days, a fucking week, it's like, yeah, I'd make a GeekNights when I felt like it.

262
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:28,730
Scott: If I was on the beach, not to twice a week, every week.

263
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:38,509
Rym: But if I wasn't doing all this other nine to five bullshit work, I'd probably feel like making actually more GeekNights because it's really fun to make GeekNights if it isn't the only thing that makes it not fun.

264
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,450
Scott: It's not be my first choice of thing to make if I had plenty of time.

265
00:12:41,631 --> 00:12:44,149
Scott: But perhaps bread and cookies would go up.

266
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,349
Rym: But right now it competes for time with other things.

267
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:47,669
Rym: That's the problem.

268
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,350
Scott: Playing King Arthur Pendragon while on a boat would go way off the list.

269
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:51,970
Rym: Yeah, but you know what?

270
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:54,850
Rym: If we were playing King Arthur Pendragon on a boat, we'd be live streaming that shit.

271
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:58,730
Scott: We could do one Tuesday episode about it when we're all done 10 years later.

272
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:01,010
Rym: Yeah, but you'd also get 10 years of live streams.

273
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:03,710
Rym: I would I just I would live stream.

274
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,089
Rym: I would do so much video.

275
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:06,829
Rym: The only reason I don't is because I don't have time.

276
00:13:08,055 --> 00:13:08,224
Rym: Anyway.

277
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:10,450
Rym: So that's my news.

278
00:13:10,511 --> 00:13:12,610
Rym: You got any news on GeekNights Thursday?

279
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:13,889
Scott: Other than the lounge?

280
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:16,730
Scott: You probably this game is going to be over by the time you hear this.

281
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:22,550
Scott: Most people I know there are some crazy people who listen to the episode as soon as we upload it, which case the game is probably happening.

282
00:13:22,911 --> 00:13:25,110
Rym: Once I finish, I'm doing some renovations in the studio.

283
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:29,449
Rym: I'm thinking about live streaming all our all our GeekNights on YouTube again now that I can do that.

284
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:42,730
Scott: Tonight, October 15th, 2015, there is an important baseball game in Los Angeles between the Mets and the not anymore Brooklyn Dodgers, not Brooklyn anymore Dodgers.

285
00:13:45,432 --> 00:13:50,169
Scott: And the winner of that game will go to play in more baseball games this year.

286
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:54,490
Scott: The loser of that game will go home and take a nap and play baseball again next year.

287
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:56,550
Rym: So aren't the Cubs going to win the World Series or something?

288
00:13:56,891 --> 00:13:59,310
Scott: If that happens, it'll be the craziest of crazies.

289
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:00,610
Rym: Is it going to be Mets Cubs?

290
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:01,447
Rym: Like, what's going on?

291
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:05,810
Scott: So, yeah, whoever whoever wins is going to go play the Cubs in a best of seven.

292
00:14:06,432 --> 00:14:11,010
Scott: And whoever wins four of those seven games will go to the World Series against her.

293
00:14:11,933 --> 00:14:12,644
Rym: So there's one funny.

294
00:14:12,664 --> 00:14:13,090
Rym: there's a college.

295
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:19,255
Rym: It's not my thing of the day, but there's a college humor video recently that was like if Back to the Future happened and they went to 2015.

296
00:14:19,255 --> 00:14:20,070
Rym: It's just like today.

297
00:14:20,712 --> 00:14:21,639
Rym: And it's just one of those.

298
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,070
Rym: like no flying cars.

299
00:14:23,453 --> 00:14:24,150
Rym: Everything sucks.

300
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:25,106
Rym: There's still racism.

301
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,189
Rym: There are hoverboards.

302
00:14:27,631 --> 00:14:31,570
Rym: But at one point, there's this long monologue that happens because he sees like Cubs.

303
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:33,770
Rym: He's like, oh, the Cubs won the World Series.

304
00:14:34,071 --> 00:14:40,910
Rym: And then there's this long thing about actually baseball is in a steep decline and interest in blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and steroid and blah, blah, blah.

305
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,029
Rym: Things of the day.

306
00:14:49,571 --> 00:14:51,970
Rym: I got a huge backlog of cool things I've seen.

307
00:14:52,230 --> 00:15:01,089
Rym: But these are interesting enough that I'm going to go by the rule of, you know, the thing of the day, like the best thing I saw today or, you know, something like that.

308
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:05,707
Rym: So I got two tweets here because these tweets are extraordinary and they're tips of icebergs.

309
00:15:06,632 --> 00:15:09,790
Rym: Tweet number one is the wizard of the Democratic debate.

310
00:15:11,481 --> 00:15:11,888
Rym: The wizard.

311
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:18,590
Rym: Very few people watch the United States Democratic primary debate because it's either going to be Hillary or Bernie.

312
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,170
Rym: And those debates aren't.

313
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:22,009
Rym: Why not both?

314
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:29,770
Rym: Because Hillary would probably not pick Bernie because as a VP, he doesn't bring a state to the table that would otherwise be in contention.

315
00:15:31,192 --> 00:15:33,890
Rym: That's how VP picks work for the Democrats.

316
00:15:34,393 --> 00:15:37,570
Rym: They'd only bring Bernie if Bernie had some.

317
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:38,970
Scott: And Vermont was swinging to the right?

318
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,049
Rym: Yeah, that's not going to happen.

319
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:42,290
Rym: Vermont is going to be blue.

320
00:15:42,553 --> 00:15:43,810
Scott: You don't even need to visit Vermont.

321
00:15:44,637 --> 00:15:45,548
Scott: They need someone from Florida, Ohio.

322
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:48,265
Scott: Vermont is so far left, they voted for Bernie to be this.

323
00:15:50,791 --> 00:16:01,649
Rym: Meanwhile, on the other side, so the Republican debate is like, it's like America took everything that's fucked up about itself, put it all on one stage and let it all happen.

324
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:09,210
Rym: So for people like me who are cynically and deeply disavowed of real politics, I treat it like football.

325
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:12,830
Rym: And watching the Democratic debate is like watching...

326
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:13,589
Scott: It's a waste of time?

327
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:17,610
Rym: It's like watching that football game we saw in Buffalo that one time that we left at halftime.

328
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,170
Rym: Like, it's just not fun to watch.

329
00:16:19,692 --> 00:16:24,110
Scott: Right, and you would have been better off not watching in the first place, which is why I didn't watch in the first place.

330
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,829
Rym: The Republican debate is like watching...

331
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:26,930
Scott: You're better off staying at home where it's warm.

332
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:30,270
Rym: It's like watching that crazy Italian fuck everything, no rules football.

333
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:31,408
Scott: No, it's not.

334
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:32,169
Scott: Yeah, it is.

335
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:32,829
Rym: No, it's not.

336
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:36,769
Rym: Yeah, like right now, so Ben Carson, Donald Trump, just some politics news that Scott doesn't care about.

337
00:16:37,532 --> 00:16:40,810
Rym: The two of them combined have like 40 or 50 percent of the polling.

338
00:16:41,071 --> 00:16:45,250
Rym: They're actually pretty much both far and away beyond everyone else in the pack.

339
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:51,408
Rym: The two of them just said apparently that they might boycott the rest of the debates because fuck you, we're going to win without them.

340
00:16:53,271 --> 00:16:54,570
Rym: Interesting things are happening in US politics.

341
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:55,570
Scott: I like that, actually.

342
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:55,897
Scott: Yeah.

343
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:56,240
Scott: Yeah.

344
00:16:57,432 --> 00:16:59,049
Rym: I'm waiting for the two of them to be like, you know what?

345
00:16:59,373 --> 00:17:00,729
Rym: Like, here's what I would do if I were them.

346
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:06,281
Scott: I watch a debate when someone makes it a real debate where the person asking the questions is like, "You didn't answer the question.

347
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,310
Scott: You must answer the question.

348
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:09,348
Scott: We're all going to sit here until you answer

349
00:17:09,407 --> 00:17:09,449
Scott: it.".

350
00:17:09,634 --> 00:17:09,806
Scott: Yup.

351
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,290
Scott: That did not answer the question.

352
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,069
Scott: We're going to sit here again until you answer it.

353
00:17:13,231 --> 00:17:13,847
Rym: I would have a buzzer.

354
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:20,410
Scott: If you tell me the debate is doing it like that, then I will watch every single second with full, wrapped attention.

355
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:22,407
Rym: I want a buzzer and I want a shocker on each of them.

356
00:17:23,133 --> 00:17:27,444
Scott: If you don't answer the question, if you make a tangent, if you do anything that's unrelated to the question, right?

357
00:17:28,854 --> 00:17:31,290
Rym: But many other interesting things are happening in the debate.

358
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:36,589
Scott: If you don't answer fast enough, if you make a factual error, you make a grammatical error.

359
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,950
Rym: In the Democratic debate, there was a crowd, like people in the audience.

360
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,550
Scott: Yeah, it wouldn't be much of a debate if no one was watching.

361
00:17:43,551 --> 00:17:46,410
Rym: In the audience, there is a wizard.

362
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:54,610
Rym: They had this weird, bright blue Rym light coming in from multiple angles on the audience to make it look really cool, I guess.

363
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:58,750
Rym: Everyone just looks kind of bluish, except for this wizard dude.

364
00:17:58,890 --> 00:17:59,709
Scott: He's wearing a blue shirt.

365
00:18:00,351 --> 00:18:09,490
Rym: His hair, he is a majestic wizard, and his hair is highlighted so deeply blue, it almost looks like he's photoshopped in.

366
00:18:10,453 --> 00:18:16,890
Rym: He is watching through the telepresence of his wizardry, and he shows up in the audience a lot.

367
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:17,547
Scott: Maybe it was.

368
00:18:18,872 --> 00:18:21,410
Rym: You cannot help but see this dude.

369
00:18:22,031 --> 00:18:25,050
Scott: I'm sure this dude is going to be on some talk show soon.

370
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:25,836
Scott: Oh, definitely.

371
00:18:25,876 --> 00:18:27,050
Rym: This guy, I want him to run for president.

372
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:31,170
Scott: They're going to find this dude and talk to him, and maybe he's already an important dude to begin with.

373
00:18:31,432 --> 00:18:32,369
Scott: Where was the debate held?

374
00:18:33,411 --> 00:18:34,009
Scott: College, usually?

375
00:18:34,231 --> 00:18:34,548
Scott: You know what?

376
00:18:34,732 --> 00:18:35,530
Scott: It's usually at a college.

377
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:36,769
Scott: You're probably a professor there.

378
00:18:36,971 --> 00:18:41,310
Rym: If no one's done it yet, I'm going to see if I can track him down and get him on GeekNights before he shows up on real media.

379
00:18:41,632 --> 00:18:42,330
Scott: All right, go for it.

380
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,390
Rym: If I can get this guy on GeekNights, I'm going to get him on GeekNights.

381
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:48,109
Scott: He's probably just a professor at the college, because usually the debates are at colleges.

382
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:52,750
Rym: I am confident that whatever this guy is ...

383
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,089
Scott: Or he could just be local old guy.

384
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:57,790
Rym: I am confident we could have a fascinating 50-minute conversation with this dude.

385
00:18:58,172 --> 00:19:06,170
Scott: Anyone who's that old who grows that kind of beard, at the very least, either has war stories, grognard stories ...

386
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:08,950
Rym: No, but he has the long hair, too, and it's long, straight ...

387
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:11,170
Scott: Or believes crazy nut conspiracy things.

388
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:15,010
Rym: It's stark white, long, straight, well-groomed hair.

389
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,969
Rym: This is not eunuch Santa hair.

390
00:19:17,816 --> 00:19:19,670
Scott: He could just be a well-groomed eunuch Santa.

391
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,430
Rym: But that is a contradiction.

392
00:19:23,652 --> 00:19:24,390
Scott: Anyway ...

393
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:28,108
Rym: And the other tweet that I got here that is equally beautiful is Danky Kang.

394
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,180
Rym: There was an answer on Jeopardy.

395
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:40,047
Rym: Yes, there was an answer on Jeopardy, and the answer was basically, "This video game character who is blue is known for collecting rings and going

396
00:19:40,107 --> 00:19:40,508
Rym: fast.".

397
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:43,389
Scott: Could that be Knuckles the Echidna?

398
00:19:44,071 --> 00:19:46,290
Scott: He collects rings, and I'm colorblind.

399
00:19:47,033 --> 00:19:48,023
Scott: Red, blue, colorblind.

400
00:19:48,043 --> 00:19:48,669
Scott: It's a thing now.

401
00:19:50,952 --> 00:19:53,850
Rym: But apparently, the answer to this is Danky Kang.

402
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:57,770
Rym: It's a delightful tweet.

403
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:58,323
Scott: Sure.

404
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:03,749
Scott: All right, so I think I might have done a video from this guy's YouTube account as a thing of the day before.

405
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:04,306
Scott: A bit guy?

406
00:20:04,632 --> 00:20:05,669
Scott: No, not that guy.

407
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:10,010
Scott: So there's a YouTube account called S-W-U-N-Y-O-O-N.

408
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:15,430
Scott: It's this Korean dude, but he's fluent in English, fluent enough to correctly subtitle his own videos in English.

409
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:19,297
Scott: And you know, there's those reaction videos like, "Kids react.

410
00:20:19,863 --> 00:20:20,348
Scott: Old people

411
00:20:20,388 --> 00:20:20,530
Scott: react."

412
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:23,430
Scott: And that's usually highlighting age differences in culture.

413
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:30,582
Scott: He does videos highlighting culture shock of Korea versus rest of world, usually America, right?

414
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:42,689
Scott: So his first video ever was, "Korean girls are introduced to Nicki Minaj Anaconda," which is like, you know, it's a music video that's so inappropriate, it would not be allowed on Korean television, right?

415
00:20:43,235 --> 00:20:51,509
Scott: And he went on to make other videos like, "Korean guys are introduced to The Interview," which is that movie where, you know, Kim Jong-un gets blown up by a train or whatever, right?

416
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:51,902
Scott: Oh, yeah.

417
00:20:52,511 --> 00:21:05,690
Scott: And then he goes to Japan and he asked all the-- He goes to Japan, he gets to go to school, and he made a couple videos that were like-- He went asking all the people of all the different nationalities who were at the school in Japan, and he's like, "How do you tell when someone's an American?

418
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:06,866
Scott: How do you tell when someone's a

419
00:21:06,886 --> 00:21:07,130
Scott: Korean?".

420
00:21:07,312 --> 00:21:09,150
Rym: Oh, that sounds delicious, the American one.

421
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:16,827
Scott: Right, but his latest video is the most choice, which is, "Korean girls watch South

422
00:21:16,868 --> 00:21:17,089
Scott: Park.".

423
00:21:18,514 --> 00:21:19,790
Scott: He makes them watch South Park.

424
00:21:20,133 --> 00:21:20,528
Rym: What season?

425
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,630
Scott: He makes them watch two episodes.

426
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:31,610
Scott: I forget what the first-- Oh, the first episode was-- Oh, the one where Butter's dad goes to the gay brothel.

427
00:21:33,072 --> 00:21:37,070
Scott: And the second one he makes them watch is the Steve Jobs centipod one.

428
00:21:37,734 --> 00:21:40,450
Rym: Oh, that one might be the grossest one.

429
00:21:40,991 --> 00:21:49,470
Scott: And the thing is, though, is I realized-- I mean, you can watch this video for yourself if you're going to, but the thing is South Park is so American.

430
00:21:50,091 --> 00:21:54,407
Scott: If you're not American, it's really, really, really hard to understand what the hell's going on.

431
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:55,530
Rym: Huh, that's interesting.

432
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:57,370
Rym: I never really thought about it that way.

433
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:01,409
Scott: Right, and even the newer episodes are so timely, too.

434
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:05,190
Scott: They're either-- Oh, yeah, so think about it.

435
00:22:05,331 --> 00:22:06,850
Rym: Go fuck yourselves, Redskins.

436
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,544
Rym: How would anyone outside of the U.S.

437
00:22:09,585 --> 00:22:12,029
Rym: and maybe Canada even know what the fuck that's about?

438
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:13,450
Scott: They don't know shit, right?

439
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:16,649
Scott: And it's like, even if you understand the jokes, you're not going to laugh.

440
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:24,249
Rym: You know, it's like us watching really deep in Japanese shows where it's like, "I get that a pun happened

441
00:22:24,289 --> 00:22:24,390
Rym: there.".

442
00:22:25,252 --> 00:22:26,149
Scott: But you don't laugh at it.

443
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,690
Rym: Yeah, I get it, and then I see the subtitles.

444
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:33,090
Scott: I understand that that was-- Yes, okay, you've explained it to me, but I don't laugh.

445
00:22:33,171 --> 00:22:36,210
Rym: Oh, it sounded like she said caterpillar, bushy eyebrows, something?

446
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:38,850
Rym: All right, and the guy has really bushy eyebrows because he's old.

447
00:22:39,131 --> 00:22:40,629
Rym: Okay, something happened there.

448
00:22:41,191 --> 00:22:42,969
Scott: But yeah, this guy's YouTube channel is the best.

449
00:22:43,371 --> 00:22:53,810
Scott: He doesn't upload too many videos, and the thing is his video production is very good and nice and his subtitles are good, and it's not produced the same way those other React videos are produced.

450
00:22:54,692 --> 00:22:57,850
Scott: It's produced in a way that is pleasant to watch and short.

451
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,730
Scott: The video's only five and a half minutes long.

452
00:22:59,991 --> 00:23:08,909
Rym: In the meta moment, the Book Club book was the Wheel of Time book one, and until further notice, the new Book Club book is the rest of the fucking Wheel of Time because we just keep reading them.

453
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:09,829
Scott: The square of space?

454
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:14,079
Rym: Yeah, it's--.

455
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:15,389
Rym: Matt needs to shut up.

456
00:23:16,976 --> 00:23:18,189
Scott: He hasn't really said anything lately.

457
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:21,070
Scott: He's just sort of hanging there with his magic spear that he got of evil.

458
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:29,909
Rym: But up until that point, if he had just been quiet at any point for the three previous books, a lot of things would have turned out a lot better for him.

459
00:23:30,531 --> 00:23:31,137
Rym: Just listen.

460
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,330
Rym: Someone's telling you something.

461
00:23:32,531 --> 00:23:33,290
Rym: Just listen to them.

462
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:34,742
Rym: Stop saying, "Burn me!

463
00:23:34,883 --> 00:23:35,126
Rym: Fuck

464
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:35,307
Rym: you!".

465
00:23:35,935 --> 00:23:36,868
Rym: Just shut up.

466
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:38,949
Rym: And also, Perrin, work your shit out.

467
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:40,495
Scott: Oh, so Rand.

468
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,508
Scott: You seem like a man with a plan now.

469
00:23:42,548 --> 00:23:42,890
Scott: Good job.

470
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,830
Rym: Yeah, Rand's doing okay.

471
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,790
Scott: Good job using your magical powers there.

472
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,068
Rym: Nyeh-neh-neh-neh-neh-neh still needs to calm down.

473
00:23:52,578 --> 00:23:53,848
Rym: Uh... Rand's getting a little uppity.

474
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:55,910
Scott: He hasn't really done anything recently.

475
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:56,470
Scott: He's just killing.

476
00:23:56,931 --> 00:23:58,990
Rym: He's being a little adversarial.

477
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:00,228
Rym: Well, I guess.

478
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:02,737
Rym: I like the proactive go-getters.

479
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,190
Scott: I don't like the troublemakers.

480
00:24:06,932 --> 00:24:07,690
Scott: Also, evil guys.

481
00:24:08,251 --> 00:24:08,889
Scott: Some of them are good.

482
00:24:09,211 --> 00:24:11,490
Rym: I like the evil guys a lot, actually.

483
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:12,868
Scott: Yeah, evil guys are getting the job done.

484
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:15,710
Rym: What did Luke always say?

485
00:24:15,791 --> 00:24:16,590
Rym: Evil does its job.

486
00:24:16,771 --> 00:24:17,076
Scott: You know what?

487
00:24:17,097 --> 00:24:17,790
Scott: Low gain, also.

488
00:24:19,515 --> 00:24:20,449
Rym: We knew way back.

489
00:24:21,214 --> 00:24:21,961
Rym: They fired him.

490
00:24:22,022 --> 00:24:22,870
Scott: He's a Chekhov's gun.

491
00:24:22,991 --> 00:24:23,497
Scott: And you know what?

492
00:24:23,557 --> 00:24:24,670
Scott: That trigger's getting pulled.

493
00:24:25,352 --> 00:24:26,870
Rym: Yeah, these books are nothing but.

494
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:28,190
Rym: Anything appears.

495
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:29,479
Scott: It's not Chekhov's gun.

496
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,370
Scott: It's like Chekhov's armory.

497
00:24:30,771 --> 00:24:36,730
Rym: This book is just... Everything that ever comes up comes up again later, and it's a big deal.

498
00:24:37,273 --> 00:24:38,108
Rym: That's the way they go.

499
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:39,507
Rym: Which I'm okay with.

500
00:24:40,914 --> 00:24:44,090
Rym: People said book six is when we'll get tired and stop reading, so I'm curious.

501
00:24:46,137 --> 00:24:46,730
Rym: Other metamoment?

502
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:50,870
Rym: Probably starting up some Patreon biz, and I'll be talking about that more.

503
00:24:51,979 --> 00:24:53,390
Rym: That'll get you some things.

504
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:56,170
Rym: I'm also re-spinning up if you want Geeknight's t-shirts.

505
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,969
Rym: I'm going to re-release the old t-shirt.

506
00:24:58,571 --> 00:25:01,847
Scott: Amazon has a thing now that's sort of like Cafe Press only less garbage-y.

507
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:07,889
Rym: The main reason we stopped doing t-shirts is one, having a New York tax ID was a pain in the ass.

508
00:25:08,231 --> 00:25:10,290
Rym: Two, manually shipping those shirts.

509
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:12,269
Rym: Actually, a lot of you ordered shirts.

510
00:25:13,433 --> 00:25:20,689
Rym: I had to carry a fucking bin of shirts to the post office every few days on my way to work and dump them all in the bin one by one with my stuff.

511
00:25:21,791 --> 00:25:23,587
Rym: That's kind of why I stopped offering them.

512
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:25,888
Scott: We're not trying to make money on them.

513
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:31,005
Rym: No, we'll make a little money, but mostly people kept asking for swag and we're lazy.

514
00:25:31,914 --> 00:25:36,049
Rym: If you donate enough on the Patreon, we can quit our jobs and make all the swag you want.

515
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:38,089
Scott: You have to donate a lot on the Patreon.

516
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:39,510
Rym: We'll make the Geeknight's Loot Crate.

517
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:44,050
Rym: It'll be just like Loot Crate, but we'll send you stuff if you sign up for it every month, guaranteed.

518
00:25:44,671 --> 00:25:44,841
Scott: Sure.

519
00:25:45,153 --> 00:25:46,070
Rym: You'll get something in the mail.

520
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:47,670
Scott: I'll send you all the stuff in my apartment.

521
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:49,370
Scott: I want to get rid of plenty of nerdy stuff.

522
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:53,529
Rym: Oh, it's Rym's last three cell phones and a broken RAM stick.

523
00:25:54,894 --> 00:25:55,448
Scott: What's this?

524
00:25:56,011 --> 00:25:58,950
Scott: A super old sound card that may or may not work.

525
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:00,649
Scott: Oh, and what's this?

526
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:05,609
Scott: Comics that Scott bought in a discount bin at a convention like seven years ago that he's never going to read again.

527
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:07,589
Rym: Oh, a laser printer with a full cartridge.

528
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:10,010
Scott: Ooh, an empty inkjet cartridge.

529
00:26:10,912 --> 00:26:13,090
Rym: Like $40 in Singaporean money.

530
00:26:17,014 --> 00:26:20,230
Scott: Maybe that could be a business, the completely random bullshit Loot Crate.

531
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:22,690
Scott: You have no guarantees about what will be in there.

532
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:25,530
Scott: It will be something of value to somebody.

533
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:35,590
Rym: The first person, Scott, for real, the first person to do that and make a big social media splash about it will make money and get a lot of press and attention, and no one else will.

534
00:26:36,156 --> 00:26:36,829
Scott: Here's how it'll work.

535
00:26:37,413 --> 00:26:38,949
Scott: Send us shit you want to get rid of.

536
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:43,790
Scott: We will randomly send it to fucking someone else that also signed up, right?

537
00:26:44,255 --> 00:26:45,530
Scott: It's like super secret Santa.

538
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:46,990
Scott: Everyone just send us all the stuff.

539
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:50,010
Scott: We'll put it in a warehouse, shuffle it up, and send it out every month.

540
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:56,010
Rym: Yes, my name is Jim, and I'm sending you 40 barrels of toxic waste from my factory.

541
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:57,027
Scott: Oh, okay.

542
00:26:57,251 --> 00:26:58,829
Scott: Well, someone else is going to deal with it now.

543
00:27:00,673 --> 00:27:01,010
Rym: Oh.

544
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:01,750
Rym: Dropshipping.

545
00:27:03,012 --> 00:27:05,364
Rym: That serves to be nothing but industrial waste and drugs.

546
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:13,709
Scott: Well, I mean, look, if you just want to give away your fucking drugs, and we're going to send them to someone else, we're not going to do them.

547
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:20,946
Rym: That is a nice segue, because one of the things that parents are always afraid of on Halloween even when I was a kid was, "Oh, my God, people are going to put drugs in the

548
00:27:20,987 --> 00:27:21,170
Rym: candy.".

549
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:21,788
Rym: Like, no, they're not.

550
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:22,649
Scott: That has never happened.

551
00:27:23,793 --> 00:27:27,149
Rym: Kids, if they found marijuana in their candy...

552
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:28,483
Scott: We'd be like, "Ew, this isn't candy.

553
00:27:28,544 --> 00:27:28,807
Scott: Fuck.".

554
00:27:29,271 --> 00:27:32,307
Rym: Or at worst, they would say, "Wow, free

555
00:27:32,347 --> 00:27:32,870
Rym: marijuana.".

556
00:27:35,673 --> 00:27:39,970
Scott: No one who has marijuana is giving it away for free to kids on Halloween.

557
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:43,470
Rym: Yeah, unless they do it by accident because they put the wrong bowl out, I guess.

558
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:47,150
Scott: I guess if they were doing it on Halloween and some trick-or-treaters came.

559
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:49,170
Rym: Yeah, the thing is, it doesn't make you stupid like that.

560
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,230
Scott: Hey, kids, want to get high?

561
00:27:52,494 --> 00:27:53,410
Rym: Someone made a great tweet.

562
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:58,479
Rym: It showed a tiny Twix bar broken open and just a handgun sitting in between.

563
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,689
Rym: It's like, "Watch out!

564
00:27:59,871 --> 00:28:00,840
Rym: I found this in my kid's

565
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:01,244
Rym: candy!".

566
00:28:02,093 --> 00:28:03,870
Scott: No one has ever put razor blades in the candy.

567
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:09,689
Rym: Yeah, I mean, I'm sure it has happened once in some crazy, but no, that's not a thing.

568
00:28:10,434 --> 00:28:17,510
Rym: Though, when I was a kid in high school, a messed up kid in my class actually did open a box of candy and put needles in it and gave it to the teacher.

569
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:19,530
Scott: But that was a messed up kid, not an evil adult.

570
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:22,230
Scott: Even the craziest of adults didn't do that.

571
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:25,410
Rym: Yeah, craziest adults gonna stab a bunch of people on an Amtrak or something instead.

572
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:26,326
Scott: That's right, that's right.

573
00:28:26,387 --> 00:28:26,510
Scott: Anyway.

574
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:29,450
Scott: I can't believe we never did an episode on this.

575
00:28:29,731 --> 00:28:38,456
Scott: I was looking through some photos and I was in Connecticut last, and no one really took a lot of photos, relatively speaking, unless we went to Disney World or some shit.

576
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,950
Scott: But there were Halloween photos.

577
00:28:40,131 --> 00:28:43,127
Scott: so I saw some Halloween costumes that had been erased from my mind.

578
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:50,981
Scott: Like, dog, My ones like that were Gennaro's scary mask.

579
00:28:51,042 --> 00:28:53,349
Scott: that made everyone my sister really upset.

580
00:28:54,053 --> 00:28:55,002
Rym: My parents dressed us up.

581
00:28:55,043 --> 00:28:58,929
Rym: The earliest costume I can remember was Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy.

582
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:01,289
Rym: Me and my little brother dressed up as them.

583
00:29:01,931 --> 00:29:04,190
Rym: I'm sure there's pictures of that I could find somewhere.

584
00:29:04,974 --> 00:29:12,980
Rym: The first costume that any input win is I wanted to be army guy and carry a gun and that was like second or third grade.

585
00:29:13,565 --> 00:29:21,289
Rym: Pretty sure like 80% of the boys in my school were dressed up as army guy with gun that one year for some reason.

586
00:29:21,811 --> 00:29:22,657
Rym: I don't know what it was.

587
00:29:22,698 --> 00:29:24,149
Rym: We were all into army man with gun.

588
00:29:24,633 --> 00:29:26,315
Rym: We all had the same like fake Colt .45 gun.

589
00:29:29,075 --> 00:29:35,910
Scott: In first grade the most popular thing everyone at Ghostbuster was the top.

590
00:29:36,812 --> 00:29:42,050
Rym: Everyone bought that plastic Ghostbusters like the one like the toy and used that as their costume.

591
00:29:43,091 --> 00:29:48,859
Rym: I had that toy but instead my mom made both of us legit fucking Ghostbusters costumes like made them.

592
00:29:49,465 --> 00:29:51,448
Scott: Yeah there were some people who made them, some people who didn't.

593
00:29:52,312 --> 00:29:55,362
Scott: The first costume, I didn't do that because everyone else was doing it.

594
00:29:55,685 --> 00:29:59,610
Rym: The costume that really tells you the path I was on is fourth grade.

595
00:30:00,772 --> 00:30:08,978
Rym: I dressed up as vampire 100D because that was like once I knew that you actually look like vampire 100D.

596
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:12,756
Rym: In my mind I know that I looked exactly like vampire 100D.

597
00:30:12,776 --> 00:30:15,770
Rym: I know I looked exactly like that Amano drawing.

598
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:19,201
Rym: I'm sure that is how it was and I don't have a picture handy.

599
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:28,010
Rym: I feel like if I never looked then as far as I'm concerned I looked exactly like D and no one knew what the hell that was because no one watched anime.

600
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:29,547
Rym: Anime didn't exist for those people.

601
00:30:31,668 --> 00:30:37,410
Scott: I had some of those costumes where you bought them at Toys R Us and it came with like a plastic mask or the rubber band.

602
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:38,438
Rym: I never had one of those.

603
00:30:38,902 --> 00:30:41,002
Rym: I knew they were cheap shit even when I was a little kid.

604
00:30:41,224 --> 00:30:49,590
Scott: Well one of them that I had was Voltron which is awesome and the other one I had is something that I'm trying to look up because I always forget the goddamn name but it's still in the basement.

605
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:53,670
Rym: The one where there's the three guys with the three different power suits.

606
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:56,698
Scott: Yes and they snap things onto their body.

607
00:30:56,738 --> 00:30:57,970
Scott: I think it's a Hannah Rivera thing.

608
00:30:58,596 --> 00:30:59,909
Rym: I was a big fan of that show.

609
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:01,096
Rym: Oh fuck.

610
00:31:01,117 --> 00:31:02,495
Scott: It's a garbage show by the way.

611
00:31:02,515 --> 00:31:06,376
Rym: Yeah three guys power suits kid show.

612
00:31:06,396 --> 00:31:08,316
Scott: The way the action figures worked is the dude.

613
00:31:08,336 --> 00:31:08,850
Scott: Centurions!

614
00:31:09,851 --> 00:31:10,396
Scott: Is it Centurions?

615
00:31:10,436 --> 00:31:10,577
Scott: Yes.

616
00:31:10,598 --> 00:31:11,365
Scott: Let me look at the picture.

617
00:31:11,385 --> 00:31:11,890
Scott: It's Centurions.

618
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:13,103
Rym: Here let me get some images.

619
00:31:13,367 --> 00:31:14,659
Rym: So fun fact.

620
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:15,546
Rym: Let me look at it.

621
00:31:15,788 --> 00:31:19,747
Rym: I typed into Google three guys power suits kids show and Centurions was literally.

622
00:31:19,767 --> 00:31:20,476
Scott: Let me look at the image.

623
00:31:20,517 --> 00:31:21,429
Scott: I'll tell you if you're correct.

624
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,324
Rym: I'm confident with Centurions.

625
00:31:23,344 --> 00:31:23,930
Scott: It sounds right.

626
00:31:26,658 --> 00:31:26,982
Rym: Come on.

627
00:31:27,002 --> 00:31:27,590
Scott: Click on images.

628
00:31:27,733 --> 00:31:28,248
Scott: What are you doing?

629
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:30,253
Scott: Yes.

630
00:31:30,273 --> 00:31:30,602
Scott: These guys.

631
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:30,828
Rym: Yep.

632
00:31:31,591 --> 00:31:33,144
Scott: The green guy with the yellow armor.

633
00:31:33,164 --> 00:31:35,650
Rym: I was the blue guy because the green guy was sold out.

634
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:36,929
Rym: He had the rocket on his arm.

635
00:31:37,655 --> 00:31:45,267
Scott: Those are good toys because the action figures basically had these little holes on them sort of like Lego reverse and then you could attach things to their armor.

636
00:31:45,308 --> 00:31:47,270
Rym: And the costume had the same gimmick.

637
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:48,151
Rym: Yeah.

638
00:31:48,253 --> 00:31:50,014
Rym: The costumes weren't just costumes.

639
00:31:50,035 --> 00:31:51,790
Rym: The costumes were toys.

640
00:31:52,211 --> 00:31:59,430
Scott: No the costume I had was basically a plastic onesie that you tied in the back and then a plastic mask of the rubber band.

641
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:04,499
Rym: Mine had a legit hard plastic mask in two pieces.

642
00:32:04,802 --> 00:32:09,570
Rym: It also had a plastic thing to wear on my arm that had a detachable missile and a bunch of other components.

643
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:10,690
Scott: I didn't have any components.

644
00:32:11,611 --> 00:32:12,942
Scott: Voltron one was the same way.

645
00:32:13,003 --> 00:32:18,314
Scott: It was a plastic thing but you tied it in the back and then your feet stick out the bottom.

646
00:32:18,335 --> 00:32:20,134
Rym: I just can't believe typing three guys.

647
00:32:20,215 --> 00:32:22,539
Rym: power armor kids show totally worked.

648
00:32:22,882 --> 00:32:24,275
Scott: I think it was the only one that had three guys.

649
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:25,750
Rym: Yeah the three guys is definitely.

650
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:27,530
Scott: you never did a mask costume?

651
00:32:28,616 --> 00:32:31,994
Rym: I couldn't find mask costumes and they were really hard to make.

652
00:32:32,338 --> 00:32:36,013
Rym: In fact mask toys were actually pretty hard to get because.

653
00:32:36,033 --> 00:32:36,639
Scott: Go on eBay.

654
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:38,538
Scott: See what you find if you go to eBay.

655
00:32:38,578 --> 00:32:46,960
Rym: Yeah I'm saying when I was a kid because when I was a kid one I got into masks like basically day one like early days there were.

656
00:32:47,041 --> 00:32:49,084
Rym: like you couldn't get those that even most toys are us.

657
00:32:49,124 --> 00:32:52,215
Rym: The first time I ever saw a mask toy was at Children's Palace.

658
00:32:52,235 --> 00:32:55,347
Scott: I think how the thing about Halloween in general is.

659
00:32:55,387 --> 00:33:05,307
Scott: you could tell the cool families like you can tell how good your childhood was and how nerdy it was based on your family's appreciation of Halloween.

660
00:33:05,448 --> 00:33:07,912
Scott: Yeah we still you're mad like Jesus here or whatever.

661
00:33:07,973 --> 00:33:11,310
Scott: it's like they weren't even letting you go out on Halloween and they weren't even acknowledging its existence.

662
00:33:11,732 --> 00:33:12,479
Rym: Yeah right.

663
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,469
Rym: We get excited about it.

664
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:21,528
Scott: Like first we want to go get the pumpkins and the apple cider and then we put on the cut and then we got the candy and then we ate the candy.

665
00:33:21,911 --> 00:33:29,002
Rym: We would reliably dress up the house in like the most horrific violent like horror scenes we could imagine.

666
00:33:29,406 --> 00:33:30,477
Scott: We had all kinds of.

667
00:33:30,518 --> 00:33:33,225
Scott: we just had normal decorations but we kept getting more all the time.

668
00:33:33,245 --> 00:33:34,276
Scott: We never threw any away.

669
00:33:34,357 --> 00:33:36,923
Scott: so it's just gonna be just be like first.

670
00:33:36,963 --> 00:33:46,744
Scott: we just had like these cardboard things to stick up and then we had like these vinyl bits like and it was so fun because you put like the vinyl bat in the window and it was and then you put little eyeballs on it and then

671
00:33:46,764 --> 00:33:51,856
Rym: we I had this hanging skeleton that scared the shit out of me and my brother and we were really young.

672
00:33:51,876 --> 00:33:55,189
Rym: so we'd always like get it out every year and like it's time for the skeleton.

673
00:33:55,770 --> 00:34:00,826
Scott: And then you'd make a ghost with like a foam ball and a little piece of cloth and tie it on a string on the tree.

674
00:34:00,846 --> 00:34:03,837
Rym: We made those in school but we never used them at home because they weren't scary enough.

675
00:34:03,857 --> 00:34:06,240
Rym: At home I always wanted like corpses coming out of the ground.

676
00:34:06,744 --> 00:34:16,846
Rym: Toward high school like we still did it but we'd do things like make a noose and a gallows and hang somebody from it like a dummy and then scare people when they're coming to the house.

677
00:34:16,866 --> 00:34:18,683
Scott: My mom still has every freaking.

678
00:34:18,703 --> 00:34:21,489
Scott: I don't know how long she's had this thing but at least since I was in elementary school.

679
00:34:21,591 --> 00:34:22,398
Scott: she has this sweatshirt.

680
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:25,956
Scott: It's an orange sweatshirt and on it is like Peanuts Halloween.

681
00:34:26,016 --> 00:34:27,975
Scott: Break it out every year.

682
00:34:28,097 --> 00:34:31,670
Scott: But yeah it's like you know and she literally wears it every single year.

683
00:34:32,331 --> 00:34:34,768
Scott: She wears the Peanuts Halloween sweatshirt.

684
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:40,279
Rym: So I definitely have this perception though that like it's not just us great pumpkin.

685
00:34:40,299 --> 00:34:42,277
Scott: you know Halloween special action.

686
00:34:42,339 --> 00:34:44,742
Rym: The Halloween special I actually like the most.

687
00:34:44,904 --> 00:34:47,487
Scott: They're all garbage by the way if you try to watch them now so don't.

688
00:34:47,851 --> 00:34:50,096
Scott: but the ones that were the biggest deal when I was a kid.

689
00:34:50,116 --> 00:34:54,523
Rym: The Garfield one because that thing was actually like really legit scary and kind of fucked up.

690
00:34:54,543 --> 00:34:55,936
Scott: The Garfield one was the best.

691
00:34:56,098 --> 00:34:57,715
Rym: With those like pirate ghosts and it wasn't like.

692
00:34:57,735 --> 00:34:59,090
Scott: Alright so first of all pirate ghosts.

693
00:34:59,231 --> 00:35:05,349
Scott: but really the number one thing from the Garfield Halloween special was he would go to the houses and just be like give me.

694
00:35:05,852 --> 00:35:06,096
Scott: Yup.

695
00:35:06,116 --> 00:35:08,768
Scott: And we'd just be like we'd go up to houses and be like give me.

696
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:10,135
Scott: Give me.

697
00:35:10,807 --> 00:35:10,990
Scott: Right?

698
00:35:11,414 --> 00:35:12,707
Scott: Like that was the inside joke.

699
00:35:13,172 --> 00:35:17,514
Rym: But at the end when those pirate ghosts come it's not like Scooby Doo oh no a pirate ghost.

700
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:19,414
Scott: It's like no it's going to kill Garfield and Odie.

701
00:35:19,636 --> 00:35:22,329
Rym: Yeah it's got a knife it's literally going to kill them.

702
00:35:23,391 --> 00:35:32,710
Rym: I read a great deconstructive retro blog that wrote about how if you watch that again in the context of the wider Garfield canon there is a very solid reading.

703
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:35,050
Scott: And this was before there was a Garfield and Friends cartoon.

704
00:35:35,131 --> 00:35:38,045
Scott: this is like the only Garfield animation that existed that I knew of.

705
00:35:38,187 --> 00:35:38,430
Rym: Yeah.

706
00:35:39,297 --> 00:35:41,580
Rym: And it's not Bill Murray but as a kid I thought it was Bill Murray.

707
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:46,068
Scott: And I don't even think I don't remember it having any stupid Monday jokes or lasagna jokes in it.

708
00:35:46,571 --> 00:35:48,269
Scott: I think he did kick Odie off the table though.

709
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:51,278
Scott: Which is the real Garfield joke they don't do anymore.

710
00:35:51,642 --> 00:35:53,924
Rym: Well Garfield and Friends was actually a pretty legit show.

711
00:35:54,045 --> 00:35:55,463
Scott: Well the Friends part especially.

712
00:35:55,565 --> 00:35:55,646
Scott: Yeah.

713
00:35:56,771 --> 00:35:57,175
Rym: Anyway.

714
00:35:57,256 --> 00:35:57,599
Rym: Sheldon.

715
00:35:57,619 --> 00:35:58,286
Rym: Yeah.

716
00:35:58,347 --> 00:35:58,448
Scott: Etc.

717
00:35:58,990 --> 00:35:59,253
Scott: Yes.

718
00:36:00,104 --> 00:36:00,510
Rym: Ah yeah.

719
00:36:01,595 --> 00:36:04,410
Scott: I don't remember any other Halloween specials besides Peanuts and Garfield.

720
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:05,458
Rym: And we were also.

721
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:11,865
Rym: I think it was partly just because of reading comics like Foxtrot and Calvin and Hobbes but Foxtrot came way later.

722
00:36:11,885 --> 00:36:11,966
Scott: Yeah.

723
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:13,903
Scott: Calvin and Hobbes was around.

724
00:36:14,004 --> 00:36:25,401
Rym: But even like when Foxtrot was around and I read as a kid there was that mythos of kids maximizing their candy haul from all the newspaper comics cause those were a thing back then too.

725
00:36:25,421 --> 00:36:30,064
Scott: We didn't really super maximize but it's like we got so much candy it wasn't necessary to maximize.

726
00:36:30,084 --> 00:36:32,570
Rym: We maximized when we lived in the suburbs outside of Detroit.

727
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:34,893
Rym: When we were young actually cause we lived in Detroit.

728
00:36:35,257 --> 00:36:36,167
Rym: We didn't go trick or treating.

729
00:36:36,187 --> 00:36:36,895
Rym: It was too dangerous.

730
00:36:36,915 --> 00:36:40,346
Rym: We actually would go to the mall in the rich suburbs and the mall.

731
00:36:40,366 --> 00:36:47,098
Scott: There was a mall next to us and people did go to it but we just went to all the houses on the block and we also went to the houses on the next block and the next block.

732
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:48,530
Rym: We would go to the rich neighborhood.

733
00:36:48,611 --> 00:36:55,095
Rym: we'd go to Lakeside Mall like out in the suburbs and do trick or treating in the mall cause it was actually legit too dangerous to go around the neighborhood.

734
00:36:55,115 --> 00:36:57,479
Scott: When we were in Beacon I think no one ever came maybe once.

735
00:36:57,539 --> 00:36:59,903
Rym: That's cause our house is in the fucking edge of town.

736
00:36:59,923 --> 00:37:02,390
Scott: And in New York City no one has ever even attempted to come.

737
00:37:02,551 --> 00:37:03,319
Scott: but you know what I figured out.

738
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:06,954
Scott: what they do in New York City at least in my neighborhood is they go to the stores.

739
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:08,065
Scott: There's no mall.

740
00:37:08,328 --> 00:37:13,641
Scott: They go to the stores cause I remember it was Halloween one year and Halloween was on a Sunday.

741
00:37:13,661 --> 00:37:27,360
Scott: and I remember this because I was getting food at that lunchbox place that's closed now and the guy in there was a Jets fan and I know it was Sunday because I was watching the Giants game on Sunday night football and it was on in there and he had-.

742
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,269
Scott: How do you remember this?

743
00:37:28,289 --> 00:37:30,130
Rym: cause you don't remember fucking anything else.

744
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:32,228
Scott: cause if you watch sports you don't forget them.

745
00:37:34,138 --> 00:37:39,549
Scott: and he had you know he had these little Jets pictures hanging on the wall on the thing and a kid comes in to get some food.

746
00:37:40,655 --> 00:37:41,321
Scott: well not some food.

747
00:37:41,362 --> 00:37:51,381
Scott: a kid comes in to get some trick or treats right and he gives him apples and I'm like oh man if I got apples I would have like let some you know poop in a bag on your porch right on fire.

748
00:37:51,866 --> 00:37:58,635
Scott: but the kids were genuinely happy to get the apples and they were eating the apples before they even left the store.

749
00:37:58,695 --> 00:37:59,563
Rym: Well what happened?

750
00:37:59,967 --> 00:38:00,835
Rym: What happened to kids?

751
00:38:00,856 --> 00:38:03,300
Scott: Well I mean it is apple season.

752
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,401
Rym: Yeah but like when I was a kid there was some fucking delicious apples.

753
00:38:05,421 --> 00:38:06,614
Scott: he probably got them from the apple house.

754
00:38:06,634 --> 00:38:08,170
Rym: When I was a kid like we had apples in the house.

755
00:38:08,271 --> 00:38:11,404
Scott: my goal was full size Snickers bars and it's like we went apple picking.

756
00:38:11,424 --> 00:38:13,670
Scott: when we went to get the pumpkins we had apples.

757
00:38:14,074 --> 00:38:15,470
Rym: we didn't need you to give us any.

758
00:38:16,111 --> 00:38:21,503
Scott: yeah but it's like when I was a kid no one ever tried to give you an apple but people did give you the old lady candy.

759
00:38:21,543 --> 00:38:22,493
Scott: it's like you don't want that shit.

760
00:38:22,514 --> 00:38:23,850
Scott: it's like take it back grandma.

761
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:25,159
Rym: yup what do you want?

762
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:29,102
Rym: you want a popcorn ball so dense that it literally requires a chisel to eat?

763
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:30,697
Scott: If it's not name brand go fuck yourself.

764
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,878
Scott: take this neck away from you and shove it up your ass.

765
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:40,654
Rym: I remember sadly there was a really nice old lady at least give me a smarty and she would make like handmade candy apples and she was super nice.

766
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:45,790
Rym: but my parents wouldn't let us eat them one because as a kid I thought candy apples were nasty so I didn't want to eat them anyway.

767
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:46,839
Scott: Candy apples are not.

768
00:38:47,262 --> 00:38:50,856
Scott: I mean they're really sweet but they're not a good time to eat and you can't finish them anyway.

769
00:38:50,877 --> 00:38:52,776
Scott: yeah and they're just a pain in the ass.

770
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:55,061
Scott: but if you want to have a candy apple here's what you do.

771
00:38:55,203 --> 00:39:03,670
Scott: take an apple cut it up with one of the little apple slicey things that you push down and then just drizzle some butterscotch on it instead of caramel because butterscotch is way better.

772
00:39:04,914 --> 00:39:06,129
Rym: it's a saw of cat hair.

773
00:39:06,716 --> 00:39:08,010
Scott: so that's a problem.

774
00:39:08,071 --> 00:39:15,685
Scott: yeah but just drizzle some fucking butterscotch on the apples and then eat them or make a baked apple ready for a baked apple recipe.

775
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:16,838
Scott: it's the easiest thing in the world.

776
00:39:16,879 --> 00:39:18,938
Scott: take apple core the apple.

777
00:39:18,998 --> 00:39:20,755
Rym: do not forget to core the apple.

778
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,610
Rym: I learned that lesson.

779
00:39:22,751 --> 00:39:26,589
Scott: take the core out of the apple without removing the bottom of the apple.

780
00:39:27,356 --> 00:39:28,406
Scott: put it in some tinfoil.

781
00:39:29,012 --> 00:39:35,598
Scott: then in the middle of that apple shove in deliciousness like sugar cinnamon sugar butter cinnamon all kinds.

782
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:35,881
Scott: right.

783
00:39:36,428 --> 00:39:37,923
Scott: close the tinfoil over the top.

784
00:39:38,549 --> 00:39:41,720
Scott: put it in a tray so you don't get apple juice all over your oven.

785
00:39:42,225 --> 00:39:43,298
Scott: put it in the oven.

786
00:39:43,886 --> 00:39:48,529
Scott: wait take it out of the oven and now it is like apple pie without pie.

787
00:39:48,913 --> 00:39:50,930
Rym: also don't use some mealy nasty apple.

788
00:39:51,111 --> 00:39:54,849
Scott: no you gotta use the most quality apple that you can get.

789
00:39:55,134 --> 00:39:56,050
Rym: I'm not gonna get into apples.

790
00:39:56,050 --> 00:40:00,001
Scott: go to the apple house and get like a jonah gold or something pretty sure.

791
00:40:00,143 --> 00:40:03,534
Rym: we did an episode on apples recently where we talked about different cultivars.

792
00:40:03,554 --> 00:40:11,130
Scott: I was gonna do tonight's episode on apples and save the halloween idea for halloween times but we already did an episode on apples relatively recently.

793
00:40:11,595 --> 00:40:14,629
Scott: no it was a long time ago but we haven't done an episode on halloween.

794
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:18,324
Rym: I remember looking at the list of apple cultivars recently on a GeekNights episode.

795
00:40:18,344 --> 00:40:20,000
Rym: maybe we were talking about something else I don't know.

796
00:40:20,525 --> 00:40:24,222
Scott: I'll go find out what that episode seems like an old episode but we have done apples.

797
00:40:24,283 --> 00:40:26,990
Scott: if you want to hear the apple episode go to frontrecruit.com and search for apple.

798
00:40:27,051 --> 00:40:31,558
Rym: so I do feel like as time went on like halloween really changed as a holiday cause.

799
00:40:31,619 --> 00:40:33,679
Rym: as a kid like I lived in Detroit.

800
00:40:33,699 --> 00:40:35,839
Scott: so halloween change or did we change?

801
00:40:36,001 --> 00:40:37,173
Rym: I think halloween change?

802
00:40:37,213 --> 00:40:37,859
Scott: I think both.

803
00:40:38,182 --> 00:40:39,070
Rym: yeah we changed.

804
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:39,818
Rym: halloween change cause.

805
00:40:39,839 --> 00:41:00,769
Rym: I've noticed that when I was a kid like I didn't interact with that many adults who were younger than my parents but it seemed like a lot of them stayed home or didn't do a lot like we'd go visit like friends of the family or whatever like doing trick or treating and the people who were our age who were like their older kids or whatever were just hanging around the house or not doing a lot.

806
00:41:01,233 --> 00:41:09,330
Rym: well I feel like now the halloween party has become a big like halloween is a twenty to thirty something year old like big party holiday.

807
00:41:09,371 --> 00:41:11,473
Scott: now you realize that when right.

808
00:41:11,534 --> 00:41:15,836
Rym: so maybe those guys those kids of my parents the old friends were all just losers like?

809
00:41:15,857 --> 00:41:16,464
Rym: I don't know.

810
00:41:16,748 --> 00:41:19,169
Scott: no here's the problem where your memory is fucked up.

811
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:19,492
Scott: right.

812
00:41:19,573 --> 00:41:22,340
Scott: so at that time you were like elementary school right.

813
00:41:22,462 --> 00:41:25,551
Scott: yup right okay those kids you remember like who were older than you.

814
00:41:25,693 --> 00:41:27,935
Rym: they were like college kids home from college.

815
00:41:28,218 --> 00:41:30,744
Scott: right they were college kids or teenagers.

816
00:41:31,067 --> 00:41:36,490
Scott: right anyone older than college kids in like the eighties was your parents.

817
00:41:37,195 --> 00:41:38,363
Scott: they were already parents.

818
00:41:38,464 --> 00:41:41,674
Scott: people had kids and got married younger just a few decades ago.

819
00:41:41,695 --> 00:41:46,321
Scott: now you have people like us who were you know early thirties not married.

820
00:41:46,381 --> 00:41:46,887
Scott: no kids.

821
00:41:46,907 --> 00:41:50,844
Scott: so we're halloweening it up and we're also in a city so we're doubling it up.

822
00:41:50,865 --> 00:41:53,754
Rym: the city is a big thing because in new york like go to St.

823
00:41:53,794 --> 00:41:56,946
Rym: Marks like go to any hip neighborhood on halloween it is party central.

824
00:41:57,006 --> 00:42:01,735
Scott: also the college kids that were still at college and not home were partying it up also in halloween.

825
00:42:01,756 --> 00:42:02,039
Rym: of course.

826
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:07,590
Rym: I remember at RIT there were not many halloween parties and there was plenty of halloween action.

827
00:42:07,631 --> 00:42:09,029
Rym: not that many it wasn't that big.

828
00:42:09,191 --> 00:42:09,755
Scott: there was a lot.

829
00:42:09,816 --> 00:42:12,560
Rym: the frats threw their like giant like fucking parties.

830
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:13,286
Scott: it was big time.

831
00:42:13,327 --> 00:42:14,397
Scott: halloween action RIT.

832
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:18,277
Scott: it was like the last chance to have a blast before it fucking iced over everything.

833
00:42:18,641 --> 00:42:26,378
Rym: yeah but I feel I remember like a lot of the parties were actually the weekend before thanksgiving because people well that's you know if it stayed warm and you got lucky go again.

834
00:42:26,398 --> 00:42:28,662
Scott: you know keep going till you can't go no more.

835
00:42:28,682 --> 00:42:32,540
Rym: or random parties out of nowhere like that one that had the riot.

836
00:42:32,701 --> 00:42:34,640
Scott: that wasn't random out of nowhere yeah it was.

837
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:38,362
Rym: they scheduled in advance like hey guys this day party racket fest whatever.

838
00:42:38,382 --> 00:42:40,362
Rym: yeah yeah it was.

839
00:42:40,503 --> 00:42:41,801
Rym: they picked that date randomly.

840
00:42:42,066 --> 00:42:42,290
Scott: anyway.

841
00:42:43,613 --> 00:42:45,110
Scott: what else is there to say about halloween?

842
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:45,837
Scott: you got the candy.

843
00:42:45,857 --> 00:42:51,069
Scott: you got the halloween entertainment media like the specials and even the internets.

844
00:42:51,332 --> 00:42:54,966
Rym: we had this cassette tape that every year and I was a big fan of it.

845
00:42:55,027 --> 00:42:56,561
Rym: it was a horror sound thing.

846
00:42:56,642 --> 00:42:58,588
Scott: oh we had one of those and it was just like.

847
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:02,910
Rym: no it was like dozens of people screaming violently.

848
00:43:03,837 --> 00:43:05,510
Scott: ours was like it had witches cackling.

849
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:09,310
Rym: it had that but there was this undercurrent of humans screaming violently.

850
00:43:10,033 --> 00:43:11,287
Scott: I'm sure you can just get an mp3 now.

851
00:43:11,327 --> 00:43:11,873
Scott: you don't need the.

852
00:43:12,076 --> 00:43:13,289
Scott: yeah you don't need the cassette tape.

853
00:43:14,113 --> 00:43:21,026
Rym: we'd always watch the horror movie around halloween like the days before halloween like we'd sit down and watch like some slasher film like as a family.

854
00:43:21,066 --> 00:43:21,836
Rym: that was always a thing we'd do.

855
00:43:21,856 --> 00:43:25,370
Rym: a little alien action yeah more like jason kind of movies.

856
00:43:25,552 --> 00:43:26,319
Scott: jason kind of action.

857
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:28,118
Rym: yeah jason freddy like that kind of stuff.

858
00:43:28,138 --> 00:43:29,209
Rym: that was our halloween jam.

859
00:43:30,756 --> 00:43:31,450
Rym: I was a big fan.

860
00:43:31,511 --> 00:43:31,612
Rym: like.

861
00:43:31,652 --> 00:43:36,648
Rym: what I like to do with my little friends is your little friends yeah when I was little where are your little friends?

862
00:43:38,693 --> 00:43:40,295
Rym: they're chasing the moon in 1q84 little people.

863
00:43:42,033 --> 00:43:53,932
Rym: okay I like to tell ghost stories like not believing in ghosts just telling ghost stories to where I've never had someone tell a ghost story and have it actually be scary in any way?

864
00:43:53,952 --> 00:43:57,470
Rym: yeah well I'd sometimes would do a jump scare as part of my ghost story.

865
00:43:57,893 --> 00:44:00,397
Scott: I also jump scare because you can't get a real scare because you suck.

866
00:44:00,417 --> 00:44:01,226
Rym: I can get real scares.

867
00:44:01,266 --> 00:44:12,133
Rym: but the way I got real scare scares was telling ghost stories like they were true to gullible friends that got the scare especially when I tell ghost stories about my own house.

868
00:44:12,174 --> 00:44:13,889
Rym: that was a kid when I was younger.

869
00:44:14,375 --> 00:44:19,389
Scott: I remember you telling me these stories at RIT and you absolutely believed them at that time.

870
00:44:19,713 --> 00:44:21,470
Rym: that is how you tell a good ghost story.

871
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:26,310
Scott: you were trying to convince us so desperately that your house you grew up in was actually haunted.

872
00:44:26,453 --> 00:44:27,229
Rym: we have some friends.

873
00:44:27,955 --> 00:44:29,466
Scott: I was basically like that's bullshit.

874
00:44:29,506 --> 00:44:29,990
Scott: you're crazy.

875
00:44:30,192 --> 00:44:33,326
Rym: I remember that specific time because we went on this long walk like I remember.

876
00:44:33,366 --> 00:44:36,739
Rym: we walked through Rochester and we ended up like in that big cemetery.

877
00:44:36,759 --> 00:44:42,237
Rym: and I was telling those stories because some of our friends who will not be named were getting legit nervous.

878
00:44:42,278 --> 00:44:43,229
Scott: but you believed them.

879
00:44:43,932 --> 00:44:46,073
Rym: I believed them when I was a little kid not just a ghost story.

880
00:44:46,093 --> 00:44:46,962
Scott: you believed them at RIT.

881
00:44:47,245 --> 00:44:48,094
Rym: I did not believe.

882
00:44:48,114 --> 00:44:50,072
Scott: you believed other nonsense at RIT too.

883
00:44:50,456 --> 00:44:54,962
Rym: I did but I did not believe at RIT that my house was actually haunted.

884
00:44:55,042 --> 00:44:56,840
Scott: you seemed as if you were convinced.

885
00:44:57,183 --> 00:45:06,850
Rym: I was trying to legit scare people in fact I tell those stories every year on Fark in the halloween thread and you were trying to convince me that fairies were real.

886
00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:15,130
Scott: that was the exact same walk and I was upsetting them and you legit believed in fairies and I was the only one who was like.

887
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:15,837
Scott: that's bullshit.

888
00:45:15,857 --> 00:45:16,545
Scott: what's wrong with you?

889
00:45:17,252 --> 00:45:17,899
Rym: I remember just trees.

890
00:45:19,213 --> 00:45:21,010
Rym: dammit duane was a druid I guess.

891
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:23,150
Scott: well dammit duane definitely believed even more than you.

892
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:27,209
Rym: dammit duane was real easy to convince about stuff but that's a separate story.

893
00:45:27,431 --> 00:45:28,807
Scott: he believed it on his own.

894
00:45:29,535 --> 00:45:31,029
Rym: I think he had some chemical help.

895
00:45:31,998 --> 00:45:38,789
Rym: the best way to tell a ghost story is to act like it's true and tell people this legit fucking thing happened to me.

896
00:45:39,174 --> 00:45:40,328
Scott: act like you believed it too.

897
00:45:40,994 --> 00:45:49,824
Rym: if you want to scare people and you want legit ghost stories go find the Fark halloween thread and every year the tradition is people just tell stories like that.

898
00:45:51,054 --> 00:45:52,770
Scott: I'm sure you can find old Fark halloween threads.

899
00:45:53,291 --> 00:45:54,689
Rym: every Fark halloween thread is up there.

900
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:56,530
Scott: I'm sure there's an archive of it somewhere.

901
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:59,788
Rym: they are actually my current favorite halloween pastime.

902
00:46:00,193 --> 00:46:08,389
Rym: I love ghost stories except you know my grandma has ghost stories because she had alzheimers and thought she saw ghosts partly because of that.

903
00:46:08,776 --> 00:46:12,546
Scott: and yeah one time I saw a ghost one time I saw a ghost.

904
00:46:15,353 --> 00:46:19,030
Scott: nothing else to say about halloween except well this halloween.

905
00:46:19,071 --> 00:46:22,010
Rym: I'm going to a wedding in Florida and it's a costume halloween wedding.

906
00:46:22,091 --> 00:46:24,729
Scott: get some drunk on sugar so I'm gonna.

907
00:46:25,432 --> 00:46:27,070
Rym: actually I can't eat candy anymore.

908
00:46:27,295 --> 00:46:27,970
Rym: that's the biggest.

909
00:46:28,373 --> 00:46:29,883
Rym: I feel like I'd eat a lot of candy.

910
00:46:29,924 --> 00:46:30,810
Rym: for nostalgia reasons.

911
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:33,310
Scott: I can't eat as much candy but I can eat candies.

912
00:46:33,411 --> 00:46:36,110
Rym: I can't eat even like one candy bar like one snickers bar.

913
00:46:36,535 --> 00:46:41,910
Rym: I will feel like I need to vomit a whole full sized snickers bar I could not eat.

914
00:46:42,031 --> 00:46:42,620
Scott: if I'm hungry.

915
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:43,350
Scott: I could eat snickers.

916
00:46:43,471 --> 00:46:44,950
Rym: I could eat one mini snickers bar.

917
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:45,779
Scott: I don't like snickers though.

918
00:46:45,799 --> 00:46:46,749
Scott: three musketeers way better.

919
00:46:47,516 --> 00:46:50,669
Rym: three musketeers has like no calories in it like there's nothing going on.

920
00:46:50,791 --> 00:46:51,729
Scott: that's why it's easier to eat.

921
00:46:52,012 --> 00:46:53,950
Rym: yeah that's why old people eat mostly two musketeers.

922
00:46:54,112 --> 00:46:55,082
Scott: I could eat some peanut M&M.

923
00:46:56,293 --> 00:46:58,788
Rym: yeah I could eat like a half a cup of peanut M&M's.

924
00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:02,110
Scott: I think we've done episodes on candy though but yeah butterfingers are disgusting.

925
00:47:02,232 --> 00:47:03,330
Rym: butterfingers are the worst.

926
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:11,728
Scott: butterfingers are the nastiest nonsense and the worst is mounds and the second worst is almond joy which is saved by the nuts.

927
00:47:12,355 --> 00:47:14,354
Rym: no mounds don't right?

928
00:47:14,455 --> 00:47:17,910
Scott: they're both disgusting but they're disgusting fake coconut disgustingness.

929
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:20,130
Rym: see those aren't that bad they're not they're no butterfinger.

930
00:47:20,211 --> 00:47:21,549
Rym: butterfingers taste like bile.

931
