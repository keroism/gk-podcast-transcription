1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,988
Rym: It's Thursday, October 23rd.

2
00:00:12,149 --> 00:00:12,711
Scott: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,831 --> 00:00:13,393
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,433 --> 00:00:14,658
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:15,300
Rym: It's a Thursday.

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,301
Rym: We talk about the dorms at RIT.

7
00:00:25,869 --> 00:00:26,890
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:45,500
Rym: So you'd think, in these troubled economic times, working for one of those Wall Street financial companies, everyone would be fully vested in interest in what is going on in the stock market and dealing with the systems and the market and all this stuff.

9
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,532
Scott: Well, I mean, it depends what your company does.

10
00:00:47,592 --> 00:00:48,780
Scott: I mean, like, look, if you're a company...

11
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,530
Rym: Well, no, I'm about to tell an anecdote.

12
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,100
Rym: You see, I'm not making a general statement.

13
00:00:52,642 --> 00:00:58,612
Rym: But you'd think that when there's work to be done, you'd be paying attention to the work, and maybe it's kind of like when you're at a boxing match, right?

14
00:00:59,657 --> 00:01:10,527
Rym: More often than not, no matter how much money you paid, I'll bet that if you're watching this boxing match and suddenly two drunk guys in the audience get into a fight, everyone's going to turn and watch the drunk guys.

15
00:01:10,748 --> 00:01:13,121
Scott: I was at a football game last weekend and there were.

16
00:01:13,482 --> 00:01:18,400
Scott: whenever there's a fight in the stands somewhere, the heads turn that way.

17
00:01:19,701 --> 00:01:20,787
Rym: That really says something.

18
00:01:20,807 --> 00:01:24,005
Scott: The thing is, usually the fights happen like between plays.

19
00:01:24,045 --> 00:01:24,508
Scott: You don't miss.

20
00:01:24,568 --> 00:01:27,444
Scott: I didn't miss a single moment of the game despite seeing like two fights.

21
00:01:28,168 --> 00:01:32,209
Rym: Well, because the people fighting obviously paid to see the football, obviously.

22
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,459
Rym: But when there's not football on, they got to do something.

23
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,932
Rym: But so, you know, we're at work and I'm typing.

24
00:01:38,012 --> 00:01:38,997
Rym: It's kind of early in the morning.

25
00:01:39,037 --> 00:01:39,862
Rym: Not everyone's in yet.

26
00:01:39,902 --> 00:01:43,946
Rym: I'm doing stuff and other people are doing stuff and we're talking about, oh, what's the market going to do?

27
00:01:43,986 --> 00:01:44,611
Rym: What's going on?

28
00:01:44,631 --> 00:01:45,478
Rym: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

29
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:48,708
Rym: Talking shop and a mouse walks by.

30
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:55,037
Rym: Little mouse just kind of walks by, walks along kind of casually, walks into a conference room and then we lose sight of him.

31
00:01:55,861 --> 00:01:57,369
Scott: So it's a pretty old building.

32
00:01:57,389 --> 00:01:59,380
Rym: Well, it's the Lincoln building.

33
00:02:00,341 --> 00:02:02,232
Scott: So is this from the 1800s, this building?

34
00:02:02,332 --> 00:02:03,700
Rym: No, I don't actually know the full history.

35
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,372
Rym: All I know is that the Lincoln building is pretty damn old.

36
00:02:06,472 --> 00:02:08,804
Rym: It's one of the older skyscrapers in midtown.

37
00:02:08,824 --> 00:02:10,092
Rym: It's like right across from Grand Central.

38
00:02:10,132 --> 00:02:10,533
Scott: I guess it's.

39
00:02:10,595 --> 00:02:12,483
Scott: it's not older than the Flatiron.

40
00:02:12,543 --> 00:02:13,527
Rym: No, it's not.

41
00:02:14,149 --> 00:02:17,439
Rym: But this mouse, it's like, you know, everyone's working.

42
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,387
Rym: And then someone says, was that a mouse?

43
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,117
Rym: Everyone in the entire office.

44
00:02:22,137 --> 00:02:23,362
Rym: Remember, our office is all cool.

45
00:02:23,382 --> 00:02:26,836
Rym: Like it's one big open space with glass walls and it's kind of neat.

46
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:28,402
Rym: Everyone stands up.

47
00:02:29,044 --> 00:02:31,412
Rym: The mouse is now the most important thing in the world.

48
00:02:33,098 --> 00:02:34,141
Rym: We ended up chasing it around.

49
00:02:34,302 --> 00:02:39,723
Rym: We caught it in a wastebasket and we took it downstairs and we let it outside into the subway.

50
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:39,823
Rym: Yeah.

51
00:02:40,546 --> 00:02:41,852
Scott: Well, I mean, think about it, right?

52
00:02:42,213 --> 00:02:42,976
Scott: You're at work.

53
00:02:43,358 --> 00:02:45,425
Scott: No one actually wants to work, you know.

54
00:02:45,505 --> 00:02:51,265
Scott: And yeah, this excuse is totally thing that happens outside of, you know, the normal workflow.

55
00:02:51,285 --> 00:02:58,156
Scott: So everyone's just looking to find any reason to escape and spend some time on something that doesn't happen at work every day.

56
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,825
Rym: Well, it's a phenomenon I've seen often.

57
00:02:59,845 --> 00:03:05,071
Rym: I remember when I worked back at the hospital one day, this was back in the last month there where I didn't really have any work to do.

58
00:03:05,092 --> 00:03:08,549
Rym: I got up and I went to go to lunch and I tried to get out.

59
00:03:08,649 --> 00:03:10,318
Rym: And one of the door just like wouldn't open.

60
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:11,324
Rym: I just couldn't open it.

61
00:03:12,047 --> 00:03:14,400
Rym: So I went around to the other side and I saw that the door was jammed.

62
00:03:15,081 --> 00:03:20,468
Rym: So I went and told someone and like everyone in the car, there were like a hundred people talking about the door.

63
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:22,981
Rym: Everyone was like standing around like, well, how could we fix it?

64
00:03:23,001 --> 00:03:24,809
Rym: I'm going to try to jam a screwdriver in there.

65
00:03:24,849 --> 00:03:25,653
Rym: Oh, that didn't work.

66
00:03:25,693 --> 00:03:32,064
Rym: And more people were more interested in this door than anything they'd ever been in anything they'd ever done for this company.

67
00:03:32,124 --> 00:03:36,200
Scott: It's a way to escape from, you know, work and do at least something.

68
00:03:38,523 --> 00:03:42,183
Rym: Of course, the hospital was different from my current job in that I don't think anyone did any work.

69
00:03:43,226 --> 00:03:43,989
Scott: That's most works.

70
00:03:45,052 --> 00:03:45,574
Rym: That I don't know.

71
00:03:45,594 --> 00:03:46,236
Rym: That's all I have.

72
00:03:46,296 --> 00:03:49,226
Rym: It was it was kind of a boring day other than the mouse.

73
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:51,232
Scott: Yeah, my day.

74
00:03:51,412 --> 00:03:52,415
Scott: Not too exciting.

75
00:03:53,138 --> 00:03:57,578
Scott: Starting to, you know, it's getting a little corporate up in my business now that we got bought.

76
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:59,063
Scott: You know, they quit.

77
00:03:59,785 --> 00:04:01,109
Scott: I got to get another job first.

78
00:04:01,149 --> 00:04:01,570
Scott: And I've.

79
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:03,014
Rym: I've never been quit shy.

80
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:05,723
Scott: I'm not quit shy.

81
00:04:05,823 --> 00:04:07,751
Scott: I'm very quit trigger happy.

82
00:04:07,771 --> 00:04:10,803
Scott: The only thing is I don't quit until I got a place to go already.

83
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:11,325
Rym: Yeah.

84
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:11,586
Rym: Yeah.

85
00:04:12,108 --> 00:04:14,036
Scott: I guess the thing is that my new policy now.

86
00:04:14,136 --> 00:04:14,377
Scott: Right.

87
00:04:14,679 --> 00:04:16,833
Scott: Which I'm trying to figure out is a good policy to have.

88
00:04:16,873 --> 00:04:17,216
Rym: Wait a minute.

89
00:04:17,236 --> 00:04:17,498
Rym: Wait a minute.

90
00:04:17,517 --> 00:04:22,216
Rym: I'm going to guess never take a new job unless it is substantially better than the previous one.

91
00:04:22,497 --> 00:04:23,561
Scott: Well, not just that.

92
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:25,507
Scott: I'm not going to take any job.

93
00:04:25,547 --> 00:04:27,552
Scott: that isn't completely awesome.

94
00:04:28,796 --> 00:04:32,592
Rym: Well, I can at least say that my my change was a little more subtle.

95
00:04:32,612 --> 00:04:43,951
Scott: I basically one day said, look, because I've had a whole bunch of basically pretty good jobs, but none of them are the kind of place where I want to hang around for years and years and years and years.

96
00:04:44,473 --> 00:04:45,397
Scott: I'm not going.

97
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:57,326
Scott: the next job I get, whatever it is, working for myself or someone else is going to be a job where for years and years and years and years, every single day, even like 10 years from now, I'm like, oh, man's work.

98
00:04:57,346 --> 00:04:57,848
Scott: Here we go.

99
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:58,632
Rym: Rock and roll.

100
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:00,440
Scott: Otherwise, I'm not doing it.

101
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:10,675
Rym: See, my policy was pretty much I realized in the first job, you know, funny how I get like the best job ever, probably the last salary job I will ever have.

102
00:05:11,657 --> 00:05:16,979
Rym: And I get it when I decide that I'm not going to separate work from real life anymore.

103
00:05:16,999 --> 00:05:19,328
Rym: I'm not going to hide like, you know, resumes.

104
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:30,455
Rym: I didn't put like gig nights or anime conventions on my resume before I put, you know, I put some things on there, but I kind of left the whole podcast thing to the side and I didn't talk about kind of my.

105
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:33,307
Scott: See, I never hid that stuff, but it never mattered.

106
00:05:33,568 --> 00:05:35,717
Rym: But I finally put all that stuff on my resume.

107
00:05:35,778 --> 00:05:39,232
Rym: I like game theory in there and like Otakon and all this stuff.

108
00:05:39,914 --> 00:05:44,495
Rym: And suddenly everyone wants to interview me and suddenly all they ask about is, oh, so you do a podcast.

109
00:05:44,576 --> 00:05:45,400
Rym: Oh, you're on the radio.

110
00:05:45,742 --> 00:05:46,808
Rym: Oh, you go to conventions.

111
00:05:46,848 --> 00:05:48,277
Rym: You're a professional speaker.

112
00:05:48,297 --> 00:05:48,780
Rym: What's all this?

113
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,424
Rym: Blah, blah, blah.

114
00:05:49,746 --> 00:05:51,479
Rym: And I have like the best freaking job in the world.

115
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,121
Rym: Yeah.

116
00:05:52,162 --> 00:05:55,754
Scott: Actually, I've applied so far for one rock star job.

117
00:05:55,774 --> 00:05:57,420
Rym: It is a pretty rock star job.

118
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,182
Rym: Scott applied to.

119
00:05:58,262 --> 00:06:04,382
Scott: I applied to work with Peter Rojas at record level or wherever they're calling it.

120
00:06:04,422 --> 00:06:04,683
Scott: Right.

121
00:06:05,205 --> 00:06:09,643
Scott: And which is happens to be very close physically in location to my current work.

122
00:06:09,945 --> 00:06:11,876
Scott: I don't know if I'm going to hear back from them.

123
00:06:11,896 --> 00:06:19,649
Scott: He hasn't emailed me back yet, but he tweeted today and I saw his tweet was someone sent me a resume, but they sent me a link to a Google doc.

124
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:21,279
Scott: They get they score major points with me.

125
00:06:21,299 --> 00:06:30,399
Scott: And I'm like, ah, I was thinking of doing that, but I couldn't get the formatting to be consistent because I made a Google doc of my resume and I went and I looked at it on Linux.

126
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:32,390
Scott: I looked at it on Windows and it didn't look the same.

127
00:06:32,711 --> 00:06:34,260
Scott: It didn't look the same in every browser.

128
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:41,268
Rym: And like I had bullets on there and the realize I realized long ago, my resume has been PDFs for the last eight years.

129
00:06:41,288 --> 00:06:43,599
Scott: Bullets are all messed up in the different Google docs.

130
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:50,931
Scott: So I chose not to send him a Google doc link resume instead said the PDF to get the guaranteed formatting treated him and said that I did.

131
00:06:50,991 --> 00:06:55,056
Scott: I did tweet him and say that I said I was thinking of doing that, but I couldn't get the formatting consistent.

132
00:06:55,076 --> 00:06:57,045
Scott: So I did an open office export to PDF.

133
00:06:57,546 --> 00:07:05,987
Scott: But maybe next time, since I'm applying for rock star jobs with, you know, cool people, the cool people will like, you know, like the Google doc, like I don't know, you know, it's weird.

134
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:08,460
Scott: I'll do the Google doc link and the PDF attachment.

135
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:08,862
Scott: We'll see.

136
00:07:09,324 --> 00:07:10,147
Rym: I can't say one thing.

137
00:07:10,187 --> 00:07:14,868
Rym: I used to, you know, pretty much throughout RIT, I would update my resume like every couple of weeks.

138
00:07:14,888 --> 00:07:16,476
Rym: Like I'd keep my resume like this.

139
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:18,104
Rym: It's always ready to go.

140
00:07:18,124 --> 00:07:20,779
Rym: And I'd have like the most current version, like with me all the time.

141
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:21,301
Rym: And I was always.

142
00:07:22,325 --> 00:07:25,315
Rym: I don't even know if I have my resume anymore.

143
00:07:25,335 --> 00:07:28,285
Scott: I think I've always had it lying around on a disk.

144
00:07:28,486 --> 00:07:32,721
Rym: But the last time I made it, I made it from like my previous one.

145
00:07:32,741 --> 00:07:34,669
Rym: You know, it was like the ten thousand.

146
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:41,560
Scott: I've just been updating the same resume from like two thousand and two or some shit like that, too.

147
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,545
Rym: But two thousand, maybe unless the original is on one of those, like four hard drives I'm not using.

148
00:07:46,706 --> 00:07:48,200
Rym: All I have left is the PDF.

149
00:07:49,821 --> 00:07:52,840
Rym: Oh, yeah, granted, I have, you know, the full Adobe thing.

150
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:58,540
Scott: I think actually open office three, I think an open PDF and edit them, I think.

151
00:07:58,922 --> 00:07:59,265
Rym: Yeah.

152
00:07:59,286 --> 00:08:00,559
Scott: The feature is something like that.

153
00:08:00,961 --> 00:08:02,127
Rym: I don't know if I'll ever pretty much.

154
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,662
Rym: I don't think I need my resume for getting a job anymore.

155
00:08:04,702 --> 00:08:07,560
Rym: I need my resume for other things, like trying to be an expert witness.

156
00:08:08,202 --> 00:08:08,444
Scott: Yeah.

157
00:08:08,484 --> 00:08:10,280
Scott: Well, you know, you never know when you need a resume.

158
00:08:10,721 --> 00:08:10,922
Rym: Yeah.

159
00:08:10,942 --> 00:08:20,520
Scott: But I feel like I think I'm just going to make my quote unquote, I mean, you're going to work at the same place for, you know, you might work there for five, maybe ten years, but you'll need another job after that.

160
00:08:21,122 --> 00:08:21,423
Rym: I don't know.

161
00:08:21,484 --> 00:08:23,977
Scott: I pretty much feel like you're going to work there for 30, 40 years.

162
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,592
Rym: No, I feel like this is my penultimate job, as in I will.

163
00:08:27,712 --> 00:08:34,200
Rym: either this will be my career or I will leave it at a point when I no longer will be working for someone else.

164
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,114
Rym: It's going to be one of the two.

165
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,462
Scott: Yeah.

166
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:39,058
Rym: Or I guess, you know, if Mad Max happens, then I'll have to get a new job.

167
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,202
Scott: Well, yeah.

168
00:08:40,261 --> 00:08:53,380
Scott: Your new job of, I guess, leading my married man, leather wearing ne'er-do-wells, corpse, hokudono Ken master or I don't know.

169
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,498
Rym: I've been practicing pleather preparer.

170
00:08:58,982 --> 00:09:01,035
Rym: Why do they have so much pleather, so much gasoline?

171
00:09:02,404 --> 00:09:04,680
Rym: I also didn't realize there were three Mad Max movies.

172
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,660
Rym: I only thought there were two Mad Max, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome.

173
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,620
Rym: And yeah, that's the only ones I knew about.

174
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:16,868
Rym: But I was told by multiple people there was a third one that I guess I had three even farther beyond the next three.

175
00:09:17,129 --> 00:09:20,100
Scott: return to Thunderdome Mad Max three Thunderdome.

176
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,979
Scott: So far back there, I can't even see it.

177
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,780
Rym: Actually, I think Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome might have been the third one.

178
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,488
Rym: I don't know why.

179
00:09:26,913 --> 00:09:27,298
Scott: I don't know.

180
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,408
Scott: I am DB.

181
00:09:28,711 --> 00:09:29,419
Scott: I call to you.

182
00:09:30,342 --> 00:09:31,311
Rym: All IMDB.

183
00:09:31,634 --> 00:09:32,240
Rym: What's your news?

184
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,400
Scott: I got almost I got the Wikipedia coming through here.

185
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:35,822
Rym: Fine.

186
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:36,640
Rym: I'll tell you about my news.

187
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:43,940
Rym: So this is not a technology thing because it happened more or less in the real world, but it used technology.

188
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:53,822
Rym: But in, you know, computer science and information security, there's the idea of the man in the middle attack, which is that theoretically you have a secure line of communication.

189
00:09:54,204 --> 00:10:00,460
Rym: But one way to violate that line of communication is to place yourself in the middle, an intermediary between the two people.

190
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:14,320
Rym: So instead of person A talking to person B, person A talks to me and person B talks to me and I read their messages and respond to both of them accordingly, thus getting everything I want out of that conversation.

191
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:19,802
Scott: They think they're talking to each other, but really, you are checking everything out they're doing.

192
00:10:19,842 --> 00:10:21,910
Scott: And you can even give false replies to.

193
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:25,627
Rym: this was a huge security problem with SSH one.

194
00:10:25,687 --> 00:10:27,540
Rym: That's why we use SSH two now.

195
00:10:28,202 --> 00:10:33,223
Rym: But even I mean, man in the middle is ancient and there's a lot of it exists in a lot of forms.

196
00:10:33,304 --> 00:10:35,200
Rym: But I thought this was clever.

197
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:46,642
Rym: Some dude, some Russian immigrants hacked the Department of Transportation website called Safer Sis dot org, which apparently has this list of like trucking companies and brokers.

198
00:10:46,702 --> 00:10:51,664
Rym: And basically it's a place where you can go and arrange shipping between places for like companies.

199
00:10:52,467 --> 00:11:04,207
Rym: What they would do is they would basically use this to intercept requests for shipping, take those requests, get payment, and then subcontract those requests to the original.

200
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:08,437
Rym: the people that the original people thought were the people that were contracted to do it.

201
00:11:09,361 --> 00:11:13,040
Rym: And then they would keep the money and or keep the goods.

202
00:11:13,623 --> 00:11:14,617
Rym: And that was the end of it.

203
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,629
Rym: And it was good.

204
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:16,319
Scott: They got the goods.

205
00:11:16,681 --> 00:11:18,160
Rym: I think they shipped the goods most of the time.

206
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,700
Scott: I didn't read the subcontracting the good shipments.

207
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,959
Scott: How could they hook if they kept the goods?

208
00:11:23,922 --> 00:11:30,139
Rym: Well, you could subcontract the good shipments, but then just show up before the subcontractor arrives and take the goods.

209
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,280
Rym: So I show up in the AGMI Trucking Co company truck.

210
00:11:33,787 --> 00:11:34,519
Rym: I take the goods.

211
00:11:35,101 --> 00:11:35,623
Rym: I leave.

212
00:11:36,124 --> 00:11:42,111
Rym: The real AGMI Co truck shows up, looks for the goods, and the dude says, you already came.

213
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:43,520
Rym: I don't think they did that.

214
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,780
Rym: I think they just took the money and then left everyone confused.

215
00:11:46,221 --> 00:11:47,287
Rym: It's kind of like the.

216
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:49,340
Scott: they're making a small profit.

217
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,060
Rym: They made about five hundred thousand dollars before.

218
00:11:53,042 --> 00:11:56,260
Scott: You're making a small profit per thing because how much is someone going to pay?

219
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,760
Scott: Because you're paying the subcontracting truck company.

220
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,540
Scott: So you got to know they're only making the difference.

221
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,444
Rym: That's the brilliance.

222
00:12:01,484 --> 00:12:04,358
Rym: They didn't actually pay the subcontracting truck company.

223
00:12:05,441 --> 00:12:16,282
Rym: What you realize the way the business world works, if you buy something, you don't just pay, you submit a purchase order or something along those lines and then they submit an invoice.

224
00:12:16,342 --> 00:12:21,551
Rym: And usually they have terms like net 30, which means the balance in full will be paid within 30 days.

225
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,239
Rym: You know, that sort of business.

226
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:31,200
Rym: So basically they take money from Person A, subcontract out to Person B, keep the money.

227
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:36,304
Rym: Person B delivers the goods and then never gets paid, tries to sue Person A for not paying.

228
00:12:36,486 --> 00:12:37,700
Rym: Person A says, I did pay.

229
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,404
Rym: Here's the proof.

230
00:12:38,766 --> 00:12:41,159
Rym: That money went to some third party who's already gone.

231
00:12:43,381 --> 00:12:45,167
Rym: It's kind of like so that so.

232
00:12:45,448 --> 00:12:54,405
Scott: but so the situation is such that the the subcontracted real trucking company doesn't send their invoice to the Russians if they were sending it to the Person A.

233
00:12:54,505 --> 00:12:57,200
Rym: Yes, they manned in the middle or man in the middle.

234
00:12:58,304 --> 00:13:01,940
Scott: I don't know how that seems like paperwork is messed up somewhere, but all right.

235
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,964
Rym: Now it's probably remember.

236
00:13:02,984 --> 00:13:08,019
Rym: they had the middleman, they controlled the middleman, the trusted middleman.

237
00:13:09,562 --> 00:13:13,240
Rym: It's kind of like the the famous Chinese restaurant, Frank, only with money.

238
00:13:15,042 --> 00:13:15,323
Rym: I don't know.

239
00:13:15,343 --> 00:13:25,540
Rym: I find this interesting and I don't really have anything more insightful to say about it other than scammers in the modern world are often very, very clever.

240
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:33,075
Rym: And the real failing is that the website that people trusted was untrustworthy and everyone trusted it stupidly.

241
00:13:34,061 --> 00:13:39,844
Scott: Yeah, that's pretty much where all you know, that's it's why it's called a con man, a confidence man.

242
00:13:39,884 --> 00:13:45,699
Scott: They give you confidence in something, you know, trust in something that is untrustworthy and then you are fooled.

243
00:13:46,101 --> 00:13:48,379
Scott: Yeah, that is the foundation of all trickery.

244
00:13:48,641 --> 00:13:54,260
Rym: It's weird, though, because I feel like I don't know if they could have gotten me because I I don't trust any website, really.

245
00:13:54,441 --> 00:13:55,980
Rym: Like I don't even really trust Google.

246
00:13:56,764 --> 00:13:58,439
Scott: I trust Amazon.com kind of.

247
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,260
Scott: Well, I trust them to send me a book and I give money.

248
00:14:01,501 --> 00:14:04,779
Rym: I only really trust Amazon because Visa and MasterCard have my back.

249
00:14:05,341 --> 00:14:05,582
Scott: Yeah.

250
00:14:06,185 --> 00:14:09,060
Rym: If if Visa and MasterCard didn't have me, I probably would.

251
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,579
Scott: Then you're trusting Visa and MasterCard.

252
00:14:10,941 --> 00:14:14,840
Rym: Yes, but I trust them because if they became untrustworthy, it's Mad Max.

253
00:14:15,901 --> 00:14:21,440
Scott: OK, so Mad Max, Mad Max, followed by two sequels, Mad Max two, a.k.a.

254
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,178
Scott: The Road Warrior.

255
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:33,480
Scott: And Thunderdome came out in eighty five and as of April 08, a third sequel, Mad Max for Fury Road remains in pre-production in quotes.

256
00:14:33,841 --> 00:14:34,384
Rym: Oh, my.

257
00:14:34,645 --> 00:14:38,742
Rym: According to Wikipedia, though, I haven't seen Mad Max be on Thunderdome since I was a kid.

258
00:14:38,823 --> 00:14:41,979
Rym: I don't know if that movie will live up to my childhood, you know, it's.

259
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,294
Scott: you know, it's beyond Thunderdome.

260
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,919
Rym: Pleather and gasoline, Fury Road.

261
00:14:47,482 --> 00:14:47,624
Rym: OK.

262
00:14:47,745 --> 00:14:48,110
Rym: All right.

263
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,422
Scott: So here I got.

264
00:14:49,442 --> 00:14:54,488
Scott: I got a little news, I guess a combo of two news and then some other news, right?

265
00:14:54,508 --> 00:14:55,154
Scott: All right.

266
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:55,720
Scott: So here we go.

267
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,060
Scott: First story, these two related stories.

268
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,580
Scott: The real quick virtual quote, murderer jailed.

269
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,578
Rym: Wait, is this the Dutch thing?

270
00:15:05,642 --> 00:15:05,843
Scott: No.

271
00:15:06,024 --> 00:15:08,279
Rym: OK, because there was a similar story from the Dutch.

272
00:15:08,962 --> 00:15:12,660
Scott: It's a Tokyo woman, right, was jailed for murdering her ex-husband.

273
00:15:12,781 --> 00:15:13,403
Scott: Well, kind of.

274
00:15:14,388 --> 00:15:17,200
Scott: She logged into his MapleStory account and killed his avatar.

275
00:15:19,683 --> 00:15:21,020
Scott: She's not been formally charged.

276
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:29,120
Scott: If convicted, she could face up to five years in prison or find it to five thousand dollars because they're thinking of charging her with inappropriate computer access.

277
00:15:29,181 --> 00:15:29,444
Rym: All right.

278
00:15:29,484 --> 00:15:30,497
Rym: I was that makes sense.

279
00:15:31,205 --> 00:15:31,531
Scott: All right.

280
00:15:31,571 --> 00:15:32,080
Scott: But it's weird.

281
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,740
Scott: It's like, you know, she she killed a virtual character.

282
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,339
Scott: She basically twiddled some bits in the database.

283
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:43,280
Rym: You know, it's funny that every time there's a story like this, whatever book we read most recently has a lot to say about it.

284
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,278
Rym: All I want to say, Scott, is the sibrid.

285
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:45,947
Scott: Right.

286
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:46,271
Scott: Yeah.

287
00:15:46,637 --> 00:15:46,860
Rym: Anyway.

288
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:47,643
Scott: All right.

289
00:15:47,663 --> 00:15:48,129
Scott: So here we go.

290
00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:48,898
Scott: Here's the Dutch thing.

291
00:15:49,944 --> 00:15:51,399
Rym: Oh, so you are talking about the Dutch thing.

292
00:15:51,961 --> 00:15:53,980
Scott: Teens convicted of virtual theft.

293
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:54,401
Scott: Right.

294
00:15:55,083 --> 00:16:03,499
Scott: Two Dutch teenagers were convicted of virtually roughing up a classmate in RuneScape and stealing virtual goods.

295
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:08,400
Scott: The quote, virtual goods are goods under Dutch law.

296
00:16:08,682 --> 00:16:09,369
Scott: So this is theft.

297
00:16:09,671 --> 00:16:10,600
Scott: The court said on Tuesday.

298
00:16:10,701 --> 00:16:11,795
Scott: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

299
00:16:12,361 --> 00:16:15,620
Rym: Was this like they killed him in a PVP server and took his stuff?

300
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:22,900
Scott: No, that's what I thought it was, because that's because if that's what it was, I would say that's way wrong.

301
00:16:23,341 --> 00:16:30,641
Scott: But actually what happened was they were like at his house or some shit or in school or I don't know.

302
00:16:30,701 --> 00:16:43,984
Scott: And they they literally roughed him up and coerced him, you know, to give them his like fancy helmet and fancy sword or some shit is sort of spare and magic helmet.

303
00:16:44,024 --> 00:16:44,225
Scott: Yes.

304
00:16:44,265 --> 00:16:47,781
Scott: So basically instead, basically it's no different than beating up for lunch money.

305
00:16:47,842 --> 00:16:53,046
Scott: It's just they beat him up for, you know, hey, click on that and give me that fancy item.

306
00:16:53,107 --> 00:16:54,459
Scott: No, I'll do it.

307
00:16:54,925 --> 00:16:55,677
Scott: Oh, here you go.

308
00:16:56,381 --> 00:17:02,562
Rym: The real the real question here is, did the I mean, the Mabel story, they could just restore it.

309
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:08,045
Rym: I mean, shouldn't the first thing I mean, but shouldn't my idea of a justice system as that the first?

310
00:17:08,507 --> 00:17:12,242
Rym: the first thing a justice system should always do is undo harm if possible.

311
00:17:13,387 --> 00:17:18,920
Rym: So I feel like the first thing before we even think about punishing anyone is just give the person their stuff back.

312
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,240
Rym: There's an audit trail in both of these cases.

313
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:21,983
Scott: Right.

314
00:17:22,104 --> 00:17:23,959
Scott: There is the other question, though, right?

315
00:17:25,661 --> 00:17:46,900
Scott: Do you really want this seems to be sort of this this way of the world in which when you have a game and a game has rules, be it video game or sport or whatever, right, that like you don't really want the world government like coming in and modifying the rules of games, which are sort of like, you know, atomic in their nature.

316
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,502
Scott: Right.

317
00:17:47,542 --> 00:17:52,160
Scott: I mean, like it's OK if say something happens in a hockey game.

318
00:17:52,463 --> 00:17:52,786
Scott: Right.

319
00:17:52,847 --> 00:17:54,020
Scott: And there's a disputed goal.

320
00:17:54,422 --> 00:17:59,025
Scott: And the NHL comes down the next day and says, all right, we've decided that that's a goal.

321
00:17:59,106 --> 00:17:59,898
Scott: This team wins.

322
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:08,230
Scott: Even if it's after the game is over and they override the ref, it seems OK, like you can accept the NHL ruling itself.

323
00:18:08,993 --> 00:18:09,757
Scott: if the U.S.

324
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:19,680
Scott: government comes in and some judge says, no, we decided it's not a goal, something something that's sort of at least a really bad taste in the mouth.

325
00:18:19,841 --> 00:18:22,080
Rym: But at the same time, forget the game aspect.

326
00:18:22,381 --> 00:18:23,104
Rym: This wasn't an.

327
00:18:23,566 --> 00:18:30,280
Rym: this was one of those situations of, you know, someone in the MMO scam, someone else in the MMO in the context of the game.

328
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:34,140
Rym: This was a case of in the physical world, someone was extorted.

329
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:43,863
Rym: It's no different than I mean, by that, I would say that what if I was playing the ATM game and someone forced me to take out a bunch of money from the ATM game and give it to them?

330
00:18:43,883 --> 00:18:44,660
Rym: Right.

331
00:18:45,381 --> 00:18:59,979
Scott: But if you look at like like, you know, Pete Rosebud and all those baseball games and there was some crooked refs in the NBA and stuff, but they don't you know that it was how it was, you know, you don't go back and retcon that shit, you know, you let it be and you just fix it for the future.

332
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:06,558
Rym: You know, and if so, I think so, we shouldn't give the money back from the ATM game, the ATM games, different game.

333
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:06,960
Rym: Why?

334
00:19:08,224 --> 00:19:14,262
Scott: Because banks, you know, because the much, much in the way you're reaching, I got it.

335
00:19:14,282 --> 00:19:14,646
Scott: You ready?

336
00:19:15,172 --> 00:19:15,597
Scott: I got you.

337
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:23,379
Scott: You got it much in the way that the commissioner of the NFL right is, you know, sort of the boss of all the rules of the NFL.

338
00:19:23,801 --> 00:19:24,042
Scott: Right.

339
00:19:24,845 --> 00:19:30,720
Scott: When it comes to banks, the House of Representatives is the boss, you know, and the Senate Banking Committee is the boss.

340
00:19:31,241 --> 00:19:35,618
Scott: So so what if I have their decision in the in the rules of banking and money?

341
00:19:35,638 --> 00:19:38,020
Scott: the same way you would accept the decision of the commissioner?

342
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:38,360
Rym: Fine.

343
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:43,200
Rym: I'm playing the grocery store game and someone takes all my groceries.

344
00:19:44,022 --> 00:19:44,325
Rym: Yeah.

345
00:19:44,406 --> 00:19:45,417
Rym: From the parking lot.

346
00:19:45,781 --> 00:19:46,711
Rym: Now, now who's?

347
00:19:46,751 --> 00:19:47,540
Rym: who has the authority?

348
00:19:48,123 --> 00:19:49,172
Scott: Well, you're on U.S.

349
00:19:49,212 --> 00:19:50,019
Scott: government land.

350
00:19:50,281 --> 00:19:52,620
Scott: No, I'm not physical goods and commerce.

351
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,786
Rym: I'm not on government land.

352
00:19:53,807 --> 00:19:54,451
Rym: It's owned by.

353
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:55,560
Rym: it's owned by the supermarket.

354
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,359
Scott: The government is the boss of commerce.

355
00:19:57,982 --> 00:20:02,164
Rym: But by that logic, the government is also the boss of any game that is in the United States.

356
00:20:03,132 --> 00:20:04,080
Scott: Technically, yes.

357
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:10,440
Scott: Therefore, you realize it is a bad taste if they're infiltrating into the game and not just in the commerce level.

358
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:15,767
Scott: Like if World of Warcraft took my money, even though I canceled my account, then that's commerce that they can.

359
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:17,420
Scott: they can come in and do something about.

360
00:20:17,641 --> 00:20:23,287
Scott: But if, you know, someone takes my purse, I don't know if the government should really be stepping in.

361
00:20:23,672 --> 00:20:24,200
Rym: Well, I don't know.

362
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:35,500
Rym: I feel like if some of the problem here is whether or not those things have intrinsic value, I would argue, no, because the company in question can recreate them immediately and without any sort of consequences whatsoever.

363
00:20:36,261 --> 00:20:36,863
Scott: Yeah, it's just.

364
00:20:36,924 --> 00:20:37,827
Scott: it's a state of.

365
00:20:37,908 --> 00:20:44,440
Scott: you're basically saying you're the state of a system rather than, you know, the possession of actual goods.

366
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,540
Scott: And it's not possession.

367
00:20:45,923 --> 00:20:46,473
Scott: It's I don't know.

368
00:20:47,022 --> 00:20:48,980
Rym: Well, see, that's the real interesting thing.

369
00:20:50,102 --> 00:20:52,779
Rym: How do we define possession of digital goods like that?

370
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,200
Rym: What do what do I own that's different?

371
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:02,700
Scott: Well, I mean, theoretically, right, it's like there's all this translation on different levels of the universe between state and position.

372
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:06,220
Scott: I mean, everything possession I mean, everything is state.

373
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,360
Scott: It's what are the configurations of all the subatomic particles in the entire universe?

374
00:21:11,482 --> 00:21:12,414
Scott: And that is everything.

375
00:21:12,536 --> 00:21:12,799
Scott: Right.

376
00:21:13,161 --> 00:21:15,740
Scott: But then you look and it's like I possess this land.

377
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,660
Scott: Well, no, actually, it's just the configuration of the universe.

378
00:21:18,961 --> 00:21:19,831
Scott: Wait a minute.

379
00:21:19,851 --> 00:21:20,620
Scott: Wait a minute.

380
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:21,719
Rym: That has your name on it.

381
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,319
Scott: That happens to also say deed on it.

382
00:21:23,542 --> 00:21:24,640
Rym: Wait a minute, Captain.

383
00:21:24,841 --> 00:21:25,262
Rym: Absolute.

384
00:21:25,282 --> 00:21:30,019
Rym: I think we need to zoom in a little bit from your overarching, pedantic and positive.

385
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:35,776
Rym: You've you've committed not the fallacy, but the I don't even have a word for this,

386
00:21:35,856 --> 00:21:36,780
Scott: where

387
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:52,680
Rym: you take an argument and either draw it out to such a universal concept to where it is universally applicable and thus no longer an argument or zoom in so narrowly that you have proven something absolutely which can have no effect on anything.

388
00:21:52,901 --> 00:21:58,524
Scott: I did both, in fact, by going to the subatomic particles and also the entire universe at the same time.

389
00:21:58,785 --> 00:22:07,089
Rym: I feel like the difference here, though, in all honesty, in this situation versus, say, someone in the game tricking me into giving perps, I don't even know if you can give people perps.

390
00:22:07,149 --> 00:22:08,280
Rym: I know there's like bonding and stuff.

391
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,080
Scott: And I'm sure you can give someone an item, right?

392
00:22:10,321 --> 00:22:10,884
Rym: No, there's this.

393
00:22:11,446 --> 00:22:21,215
Rym: you can if you pick up certain items, they're bound to you and no one else can use it really to prevent what the fuck to prevent all the sorts of things that happened in every MMO that came before.

394
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:25,600
Scott: Oh, God, even I got it, man, we should actually play.

395
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:25,921
Scott: Wow.

396
00:22:25,941 --> 00:22:29,381
Scott: So we can find all the stupid shit like that and realize it's worse than we think it is.

397
00:22:30,244 --> 00:22:30,686
Rym: You want to play.

398
00:22:30,726 --> 00:22:34,704
Scott: while I'm looking at, you know, this we have like one hundred demo days.

399
00:22:34,946 --> 00:22:36,340
Rym: Some, you know, I got one right here.

400
00:22:37,466 --> 00:22:39,900
Scott: We said we were going to do it for like one day last winter.

401
00:22:40,383 --> 00:22:41,940
Rym: Well, you know, I got on a vacation time.

402
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,337
Rym: I'll be off for like a week or two around New Year's.

403
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,300
Rym: Yeah, well, we'll say we want to play two solid weeks of wild.

404
00:22:47,864 --> 00:22:48,920
Rym: No, I'll take two weeks off.

405
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,560
Scott: I'm talking like maybe two hours, two weeks.

406
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,322
Scott: What's wrong with you?

407
00:22:55,184 --> 00:22:58,294
Rym: But anyway, I feel like the.

408
00:22:58,594 --> 00:23:13,464
Rym: I don't know where exactly the line is, but there is a difference between being scammed in the context of the game and being physically coerced in the real world to giving up a password to an account from which items are then liquidated.

409
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:22,844
Scott: Normally a story with the headline, you know, teens convicted of virtual theft or virtual murder or jailed are the kind of headlines I would go, boo, what the fuck, what the fuck?

410
00:23:22,885 --> 00:23:25,860
Scott: But I agree with what happened in both these situations.

411
00:23:25,961 --> 00:23:27,760
Scott: I think it was, you know, it was right.

412
00:23:28,161 --> 00:23:29,220
Scott: We did what was supposed to happen.

413
00:23:29,721 --> 00:23:33,435
Rym: Of course, it it really depends because who owned that MapleStory account?

414
00:23:33,797 --> 00:23:39,819
Rym: and if he gave her the password and they and she had ever played it, then I think she has just as much a right to delete the characters he does.

415
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,160
Scott: Yeah, I mean, plus, right.

416
00:23:41,621 --> 00:23:45,360
Scott: Maybe, you know, he was letting her play or whatever she meant.

417
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,349
Scott: But, you know, plus, you know, does the intent.

418
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:49,702
Scott: intent matters in, you know, crimes and such?

419
00:23:50,064 --> 00:23:52,720
Scott: What if she was intending to just play MapleStory, but she just sucked?

420
00:23:53,562 --> 00:23:54,759
Scott: You know, how does how does that go?

421
00:23:55,283 --> 00:23:56,399
Rym: Well, I think she deleted it.

422
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,799
Rym: I don't know how if you can die.

423
00:23:58,082 --> 00:23:59,339
Rym: I don't know how MapleStory works.

424
00:24:00,321 --> 00:24:00,965
Rym: Wasn't that the game?

425
00:24:01,005 --> 00:24:03,300
Rym: that looked really good, but there was actually no gameplay.

426
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,580
Scott: It's like a side scrolling.

427
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,121
Scott: Nothing.

428
00:24:05,182 --> 00:24:05,624
Scott: I forget.

429
00:24:05,684 --> 00:24:09,884
Rym: Yeah, I remember playing it and then we got hooked on that other game Gunbound.

430
00:24:10,346 --> 00:24:13,140
Scott: Well, Gunbound was the cannon fodder, but you pay money to win.

431
00:24:13,441 --> 00:24:13,602
Rym: Yes.

432
00:24:13,622 --> 00:24:15,740
Rym: That introduced one word to my vocabulary.

433
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,699
Rym: The only thing I remember from that game is bungeeing.

434
00:24:18,501 --> 00:24:20,039
Scott: Oh, God, I forgot about that.

435
00:24:21,003 --> 00:24:22,617
Scott: I had something else to talk about, but I'm going to save it.

436
00:24:29,531 --> 00:24:31,010
Rym: Anyway, things of the day.

437
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:40,707
Rym: So Wyatt was a classy dude, was out for the weekend and we went hiking and stuff, but he showed us something and I'm going to inflict this upon all of you.

438
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:49,730
Rym: Someone made these people make, among other things, alternate openers to television shows.

439
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:51,990
Rym: And I want to link to two of them.

440
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:57,590
Rym: Now, the first one is frightening, horrifying and really not safe for word.

441
00:24:57,711 --> 00:25:00,209
Rym: But it is kind of an alternate opener to DuckTales.

442
00:25:01,373 --> 00:25:02,870
Rym: And it's a little disturbing.

443
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:06,830
Scott: I feel like I've seen it before somewhere, but I don't remember.

444
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:10,670
Rym: Where were you here when we show it, when we know, but I think is it that new?

445
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,309
Scott: Because I feel like I saw it a long time ago.

446
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:18,352
Rym: I have no idea now, but in case you don't want to watch that one, I have to link to a second one.

447
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:22,550
Rym: And this one's just weird and it's funny.

448
00:25:23,191 --> 00:25:27,790
Rym: And it kind of reminds me of the Hasselhoff recursion for a number of reasons.

449
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:29,289
Scott: Well, it does involve the Hoff.

450
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:33,389
Rym: It does, but it involves a recursion of the Hoff as well.

451
00:25:34,292 --> 00:25:36,190
Rym: But it is not the Hasselhoff recursion.

452
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:41,027
Rym: It is perhaps a Hasselhoff recursion, but Hasselhoff is played by another guy.

453
00:25:42,131 --> 00:25:42,978
Rym: Well, there is only one.

454
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:44,490
Rym: This is definitely a bastardization.

455
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,590
Rym: It is not the true recursion in all of its glory.

456
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:56,470
Rym: But if the first one is disturbing and funny in a really dark humor, sick way, the second one is just really weird.

457
00:25:56,751 --> 00:26:07,970
Rym: When the little mini Knight Riders come out and start shooting missiles at the big Knight Rider, that is itself in a pow pow power wheel, riding around in a cube that has images of the opener to Knight Rider on all faces.

458
00:26:09,216 --> 00:26:09,930
Rym: It's weird.

459
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:11,773
Rym: Mm hmm.

460
00:26:13,025 --> 00:26:13,409
Scott: Is that it?

461
00:26:14,354 --> 00:26:15,164
Rym: Yeah, that's it.

462
00:26:15,245 --> 00:26:15,690
Rym: What do you have?

463
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:16,830
Rym: Something more exciting.

464
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:18,990
Rym: Captain Scott on this lazy Thursday.

465
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,666
Scott: It's exciting if you like boobies.

466
00:26:22,574 --> 00:26:23,058
Rym: The bird?

467
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:23,119
Rym: No.

468
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:25,799
Scott: OK.

469
00:26:26,323 --> 00:26:27,170
Scott: The things on women.

470
00:26:28,534 --> 00:26:30,290
Rym: I can tell it's going to be a classy night.

471
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,193
Scott: Oh, it's classy.

472
00:26:31,796 --> 00:26:34,309
Scott: So Halloween's coming up pretty soon.

473
00:26:34,874 --> 00:26:36,449
Scott: Halloween is all about costumes.

474
00:26:37,073 --> 00:26:37,297
Scott: Yes.

475
00:26:37,318 --> 00:26:37,359
Scott: No.

476
00:26:37,644 --> 00:26:37,848
Scott: Yes.

477
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:38,735
Scott: Yes, it is.

478
00:26:38,856 --> 00:26:40,169
Scott: Well, costumes and pumpkins.

479
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:44,450
Rym: Halloween is primarily about parties and dressing up for candy.

480
00:26:45,054 --> 00:26:46,269
Rym: Yes, mostly parties.

481
00:26:46,692 --> 00:26:49,730
Scott: So to celebrate the costumes of Halloween, right.

482
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:52,270
Scott: You know, some people, they like the scary costumes.

483
00:26:52,952 --> 00:26:57,070
Scott: Some people like the funny costumes and some people like the sexy costumes.

484
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,570
Rym: Sexiness, sexy.

485
00:27:00,858 --> 00:27:02,509
Scott: No, not all the costumes are sexy.

486
00:27:02,972 --> 00:27:06,230
Scott: And anyway, sexy, sexy and frog.

487
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:13,336
Scott: OK, here are someone put together this gallery of the 50 best cosplay cleavage pics.

488
00:27:13,884 --> 00:27:14,229
Scott: All right.

489
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:18,470
Rym: And should this not be saved for a Wednesday?

490
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:19,978
Scott: I don't know.

491
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:21,190
Rym: Some of them are video games.

492
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,317
Scott: Some of them are anime.

493
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:24,130
Scott: Some of them are just sort of who knows what they are.

494
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,609
Scott: They're just cosplay of some sort.

495
00:27:25,831 --> 00:27:28,230
Rym: I still feel like it fits mostly in a Woden's Day.

496
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:38,430
Scott: Perhaps, but no matter what, normally I wouldn't link to something like this, you know, because normally it's just sort of a perverted kind of, yeah, whatever.

497
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:40,890
Scott: Fan service, cheesecake, sexist kind of thing.

498
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:43,948
Rym: You realize Steve Bennett has probably checked off one more mark on the.

499
00:27:44,109 --> 00:27:45,509
Rym: I will corrupt those two boys.

500
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:49,490
Scott: But some of these are way hot.

501
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:58,970
Scott: Like, I don't know what no matter what gender you are, some of these are like unbelievably hot, like, oh, man, like, who the hell is that hot?

502
00:27:59,831 --> 00:28:04,030
Scott: Like, oh, man, like you don't see things this hot on the Internet every day.

503
00:28:04,171 --> 00:28:05,469
Scott: I mean, the Internet's got a lot of porn.

504
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:09,232
Scott: You know, it's got more porn than anything in the history of, you know, the universe.

505
00:28:09,775 --> 00:28:18,612
Rym: But most of that porn, the statistic that more porn, more pornographic video is made in every 20, that's just any, you know, real porn industry.

506
00:28:18,753 --> 00:28:26,390
Scott: More porn is made, you know, not counting like photography, porn, internet porn and, you know, all the other porns, but hentais and everything.

507
00:28:26,791 --> 00:28:28,810
Scott: But, you know, there's a lot of porn on the Internet.

508
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:31,010
Scott: A lot of it is, you know, not so great.

509
00:28:31,593 --> 00:28:35,275
Scott: In fact, 99 percent of it is not so great coming from you, the expert in connoisseur.

510
00:28:35,478 --> 00:28:35,842
Scott: Oh, yes.

511
00:28:35,903 --> 00:28:36,470
Scott: I'm such an expert.

512
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:37,497
Scott: No, it's Sturgeon's Law.

513
00:28:37,517 --> 00:28:39,190
Scott: Every 90 percent of everything is crap.

514
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:47,833
Rym: You know, one needs to tell you that, you know, you know, the phrase 90 percent of everything is crap takes on a whole new meaning when talking about pornography.

515
00:28:48,676 --> 00:28:54,750
Scott: I hope 90 percent of the porn isn't crap that way, even though more than zero percent of it is, which is more than enough.

516
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:57,310
Rym: You still haven't seen that video.

517
00:28:57,530 --> 00:29:01,190
Scott: Because I'm smart, just like I haven't seen all that bad porn.

518
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:03,950
Scott: But regardless, this isn't actually porn.

519
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,889
Scott: It's, you know, just cosplay photos.

520
00:29:06,171 --> 00:29:12,509
Scott: Just, you know, they just happen to be, you know, provocative, even if there is no provocative is the word.

521
00:29:12,933 --> 00:29:13,468
Scott: There's no nudity.

522
00:29:15,951 --> 00:29:19,089
Scott: There's no there's nothing that would be, you know, rated X here.

523
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:24,702
Scott: So no, no, it's not only it's actually any nipples, even though it's a lot of cleavage.

524
00:29:24,722 --> 00:29:26,070
Rym: Cosplayers seem to be pretty good at that.

525
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:32,989
Rym: I mean, I remember very clearly a long time ago at an anime convention, there was a girl dressed up as Ray.

526
00:29:33,731 --> 00:29:42,690
Rym: What when Ray was wearing nothing but a towel and this girl was wearing nothing but a towel and foot pads because she wasn't allowed to walk around barefoot.

527
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:48,609
Rym: So she had these flesh colored pads on the bottom of her feet that technically counted as shoes and a towel.

528
00:29:49,512 --> 00:29:50,058
Rym: And a wig.

529
00:29:50,342 --> 00:29:50,949
Rym: And that was it.

530
00:29:52,351 --> 00:29:59,150
Rym: And yet she somehow managed, as far as I could see, to avoid showing a nipple or anything less savory for the entire convention.

531
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:04,209
Rym: Yeah, now, what kind of reaction is that?

532
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:05,610
Scott: I was listening to what you were saying.

533
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,970
Scott: I was looking at some Internet, some Internet.

534
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:09,149
Rym: You were looking at your own website.

535
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:10,929
Scott: Actually, I closed that already.

536
00:30:11,492 --> 00:30:12,607
Rym: So what were you looking at?

537
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:14,870
Scott: You know, just some random shit, whatever.

538
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:15,735
Scott: Let's get on with it.

539
00:30:16,017 --> 00:30:17,610
Rym: So we're back to the crap thing, I see.

540
00:30:19,634 --> 00:30:21,889
Rym: Yes, OK, we didn't have much to do.

541
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:26,070
Scott: And, you know, you can tell this is this is not going to be crab people night.

542
00:30:26,231 --> 00:30:27,430
Rym: It was a crab people night indeed.

543
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:34,750
Rym: And we had a crab people from earlier in the week and all week it was, yeah, if we don't come up with a better show by Thursday, let's talk about this.

544
00:30:35,032 --> 00:30:36,609
Rym: The thing we were about to talk about.

545
00:30:37,351 --> 00:30:40,890
Rym: I like how we always act like we're not going to reveal until the last second.

546
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,870
Scott: Yeah, you're the one who acts like we're not going to reveal.

547
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:43,715
Scott: I'm just sitting here going.

548
00:30:43,735 --> 00:30:45,809
Scott: whatever you always go along is real hungry.

549
00:30:46,495 --> 00:30:48,189
Scott: I kind of just want to eat.

550
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,450
Rym: We could just stop now and do a special.

551
00:30:51,653 --> 00:30:53,030
Scott: No, no, let's let's do something.

552
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:59,375
Scott: At least people, people, they spend their hard earned Internet bandwidths to download this.

553
00:30:59,436 --> 00:31:02,970
Scott: And they're they're expecting something to listen to to entertain them on the way to work.

554
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:06,090
Scott: If we stop now, what do they do for the second half of their commute?

555
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:10,030
Scott: So what do they do while they're bored at work all day playing flash games?

556
00:31:10,111 --> 00:31:11,161
Scott: They played every flash game.

557
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:12,010
Scott: Now, what are they going to do?

558
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,866
Scott: We need we can save them for the next 15 to 20 minutes.

559
00:31:15,952 --> 00:31:21,810
Scott: And give them something to occupy their brains until they can finally escape and go home and do something worthwhile.

560
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:29,043
Rym: So when we were in college for one, not even a whole year, but for three quarters of our time of our freshman year of our

561
00:31:29,123 --> 00:31:29,344
Rym: I.T.,

562
00:31:29,364 --> 00:31:32,044
Rym: when I say quarters, I don't mean, you know, 25 percent.

563
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:35,610
Rym: I mean, quarters as in 10 weeks plus a week of finals.

564
00:31:36,071 --> 00:31:37,116
Scott: So for 30 weeks, well, 33 weeks.

565
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:40,694
Scott: All right.

566
00:31:40,714 --> 00:31:41,489
Scott: Thirty three weeks.

567
00:31:41,711 --> 00:31:46,149
Rym: Plus all the vacations where we weren't forced to go home, which were all of them, except the Xmas one.

568
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:47,377
Rym: Right.

569
00:31:47,397 --> 00:31:48,448
Rym: We lived in dorms.

570
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:51,049
Scott: Well, the RIT dorms.

571
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:53,910
Rym: Yeah, well, we lived in dorms is a correct statement.

572
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:54,657
Scott: Yeah, I guess.

573
00:31:54,698 --> 00:31:54,982
Scott: Yeah.

574
00:31:55,226 --> 00:31:55,470
Scott: All right.

575
00:31:55,970 --> 00:32:06,513
Rym: Except for the few friends we had who because of RIT's money grubbing and the fact that they always have more students than dorms because half those people will fail out before the end of their freshman year and then there'll be plenty of dorms.

576
00:32:07,116 --> 00:32:11,469
Rym: We had some friends who were actually staying in the hotel down the street on RIT's dime.

577
00:32:12,492 --> 00:32:21,995
Scott: Yeah, well, you know, the thing that I think the reason dorm life require warrants discussion is because, you know, some people, you know, they love that dorm life.

578
00:32:22,035 --> 00:32:24,590
Scott: They live in dorms like their whole college time.

579
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:26,690
Scott: They'll even live in dorms when they're out of college.

580
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:33,230
Scott: You know, maybe in the military, you know, dormitory style living or or who knows what, you know, hostels and things.

581
00:32:33,671 --> 00:32:37,030
Scott: But some people dorms just don't work.

582
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:39,230
Scott: They just you know, they they fight with every roommate.

583
00:32:39,392 --> 00:32:40,368
Scott: They can't deal with it.

584
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:44,431
Scott: They always get new roommates switching dorms, having troubles, et cetera, et cetera.

585
00:32:44,512 --> 00:32:48,810
Scott: And, you know, there's there's a lot of things that people need to know about dorm life.

586
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:55,290
Scott: If you're on your way to college, maybe you're in college, maybe you've never lived away from home before, like a lot of people scarily have.

587
00:32:55,710 --> 00:33:03,310
Scott: Really, if you're going to college, you before you go to college, you should at some point live away from home for some amount of time.

588
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:10,790
Scott: You know, spend a month in a foreign country or go to summer camp at least to summer camp, not day camp or or something.

589
00:33:11,251 --> 00:33:13,070
Scott: You don't want to go to college and go to the dorms.

590
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:15,370
Scott: That would be the first time you're away from mommy and daddy.

591
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:17,109
Scott: That's that's not going to be good for you.

592
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:21,733
Rym: But one thing I do want to say, this is not going to be one of those how to not suck shows.

593
00:33:21,753 --> 00:33:28,531
Rym: We're not going to preach at you about how to live in dorms and how to deal with it and what to do and all the stuff we usually do in these kinds of shows.

594
00:33:29,376 --> 00:33:42,492
Rym: I pretty much just want to talk about the RIT dorms because I got to say and I could say this, too, about when we lived on campus, not in the dorms, but in the on campus apartments, you know, the the original geekhouse, the basement of colony.

595
00:33:44,181 --> 00:33:45,910
Rym: God, we could do a whole show about that place.

596
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:58,169
Rym: But what I miss about the dorms and I get this a little bit in New York City, but not nearly as much as I got back at RIT, was the fact that not a day would go by where something weird didn't happen.

597
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:00,330
Rym: Something weird always happened.

598
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:05,849
Rym: There's always the weird dude, the explosion, the fire, the naked guy screaming and running down the street.

599
00:34:06,493 --> 00:34:09,650
Rym: The frisbeeing and frisbeeing does not involve throwing a frisbee.

600
00:34:10,071 --> 00:34:10,862
Rym: I'll get to that later.

601
00:34:11,187 --> 00:34:11,350
Scott: Yeah.

602
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:14,989
Scott: I mean, you know, when you live in a house with just a few people, right?

603
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:15,431
Scott: Think about it.

604
00:34:15,472 --> 00:34:22,770
Scott: The average person has something weird happen in their life once every few weeks, once every month, you know, something like that.

605
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:23,031
Scott: Right.

606
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:27,889
Scott: But if you get enough people together, something interesting will happen to someone every day.

607
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:32,672
Scott: And if you're living with these people, then that interesting thing happens to everyone.

608
00:34:32,692 --> 00:34:44,530
Scott: And also, in addition to that, because you're living with these other people and, you know, and you interact in these ways, people will do things with other people and they'll make interesting things happen.

609
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:50,130
Scott: And, you know, because it's a lot easier to make a lot of different things happen when there's other people to make them happen, too.

610
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:54,250
Scott: If you don't have anyone else to pull a prank on, there's no prank to pull.

611
00:34:54,370 --> 00:35:01,610
Rym: But at the same time, college dorms far and away from everything else have this extra bonus going for them in terms of this sort of stuff happening.

612
00:35:02,612 --> 00:35:10,070
Rym: One, generally, I mean, it depends on the college, but, you know, RIT in particular, it was pretty much just nerds and geeks.

613
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:16,674
Rym: I mean, even the drunken frat boys were drunken frat boys playing FPS and counterstrut.

614
00:35:16,694 --> 00:35:19,790
Scott: Or drunken frat boys writing software programs.

615
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:24,592
Rym: Or drunken frat boys constructing their own hot tubs and then lying in them in the winter.

616
00:35:24,632 --> 00:35:24,893
Rym: Yeah.

617
00:35:24,953 --> 00:35:28,008
Scott: I mean, even, you know, because think about it at RIT, right?

618
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:29,258
Scott: Think about this, right?

619
00:35:29,298 --> 00:35:30,490
Scott: At most schools, right?

620
00:35:30,972 --> 00:35:38,229
Scott: It's like, OK, all the whatever majors, you know, all the normal majors, I don't even know what they are, are the normal people, the frat boys and whatnot.

621
00:35:38,813 --> 00:35:40,290
Scott: And then the engineers are the nerds.

622
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:47,876
Scott: At RIT, everyone's a nerd and the engineers are the least nerdy, the jock frat types.

623
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:49,890
Rym: Yeah, it was kind of engineering.

624
00:35:51,072 --> 00:35:53,490
Scott: Or maybe the School of Science also has some non nerds.

625
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,189
Scott: But all the other schools, right, is the what?

626
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:57,370
Scott: The computer science school and the art school.

627
00:35:57,712 --> 00:35:57,933
Rym: Yep.

628
00:35:58,134 --> 00:36:03,290
Rym: But I guess the business school, but everyone, even the business school people, though, a lot of them were really geeky.

629
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:05,150
Rym: I mean, everyone played Counter-Strike.

630
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:06,355
Rym: Everyone did all that stuff.

631
00:36:06,396 --> 00:36:08,890
Rym: Everyone did those geeky, nerdy things.

632
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:21,450
Rym: And also because RIT is kind of expensive and private and all these things, it was also at the point where, by and large, everyone there had a lot of similar interests, a lot of commonalities.

633
00:36:22,032 --> 00:36:24,410
Rym: And also we were isolated.

634
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:26,690
Rym: Remember, RIT, everyone says, yeah, it's in Rochester.

635
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:28,530
Rym: Now, it's not in Rochester.

636
00:36:29,471 --> 00:36:31,790
Rym: It's in Henrietta, which is next to Rochester.

637
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:40,729
Scott: Henrietta, at least from the perspective of an RIT student, basically Henrietta might as well just be called RIT town, even though people live in it.

638
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:48,390
Rym: You arrive at basically RIT is like this compound that is completely isolated from the entirety of the rest of the area.

639
00:36:48,931 --> 00:36:58,649
Rym: And not many of the freshmen have cars and not many people in general in the community did not fit into anything we're going to talk about.

640
00:36:59,671 --> 00:37:02,668
Rym: And you're isolated and you have nowhere to go and nothing to do.

641
00:37:03,976 --> 00:37:04,929
Scott: And where can you go?

642
00:37:05,372 --> 00:37:06,830
Scott: There's one road in Henrietta.

643
00:37:07,132 --> 00:37:10,170
Scott: It basically has a bunch of strip malls and then one actual mall.

644
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:10,411
Rym: Yeah.

645
00:37:10,492 --> 00:37:11,829
Rym: And you couldn't even walk there.

646
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,370
Rym: If you wanted to walk there, it took forever.

647
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:16,670
Rym: And also I point out it's basically the ice planet Hoth.

648
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:17,968
Rym: So you can't walk there.

649
00:37:18,533 --> 00:37:19,850
Scott: Yeah, there's very limited time.

650
00:37:20,191 --> 00:37:22,650
Scott: And add in one more thing to this equation.

651
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:25,749
Scott: You know, the sort of the eye of Newt, if you will.

652
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:27,770
Scott: Everyone's a college student.

653
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:30,048
Scott: They've got loads of free time to kill.

654
00:37:30,551 --> 00:37:32,350
Scott: They're not people working nine to five.

655
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:36,070
Scott: These are people who are in those dorms a lot of the time.

656
00:37:36,771 --> 00:37:45,349
Rym: And the way RIT tends to work is that your freshman year, with a few exceptions, there is very little difficult going on.

657
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:46,438
Rym: At least for the majority, we can.

658
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,270
Rym: basically the people who are going to fail out are going to fail out already.

659
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:56,150
Rym: Like the fact that you were going to fail out of RIT almost feels like it was predetermined from before you even decided to go there.

660
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:57,450
Scott: Yeah, much like in high school.

661
00:37:57,590 --> 00:38:02,969
Scott: When I was in high school, my freshman year, I had like these like amazing grades and then I started to let it slide the rest of high school.

662
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:05,510
Rym: Freshman year at RIT, 4.0.

663
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:09,030
Scott: Yeah, freshman year at RIT, I was like way, I was doing, kicking out all sorts of ads.

664
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:10,411
Rym: Sophomore year, 3.8.

665
00:38:10,411 --> 00:38:10,857
Rym: Then it went,

666
00:38:10,999 --> 00:38:11,080
Rym: "Ding!"

667
00:38:12,271 --> 00:38:13,369
Rym: I'll go by year by year.

668
00:38:13,369 --> 00:38:20,512
Rym: 4.0, 3.8, 3.7, 3.41.

669
00:38:20,512 --> 00:38:23,590
Scott: I don't even remember what it was, but it was pretty much right away.

670
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:24,608
Scott: It was like all A's.

671
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:25,107
Rym: No, no.

672
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:25,667
Rym: Think about that.

673
00:38:26,351 --> 00:38:34,330
Rym: To drop so quickly, my senior year, with all the momentum of grades I had before that, yeah, I didn't really go to class.

674
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:37,210
Rym: I didn't really do, I skipped a final.

675
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:42,170
Scott: Strangely enough though, I made the Dean's list once at RIT ever.

676
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:44,430
Scott: And it was my final, like year, final quarter.

677
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:47,230
Scott: I don't know what that was about, but we're not talking about RIT.

678
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:48,489
Rym: We're talking about living in the dorms.

679
00:38:48,610 --> 00:39:05,370
Rym: Now, one thing about living in the dorms was that for the majority of students, no one had any schoolwork to do because either you are one of the people who will not fail out of RIT, which means everything you do your freshman year is painfully easy, or you're one of the people who are going to fail out of RIT.

680
00:39:05,571 --> 00:39:05,870
Rym: In which case.

681
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:06,769
Scott: You're not doing your work.

682
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:07,220
Rym: Yep.

683
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:14,569
Scott: Now there were some people, you know, the bookworms, the people who have the nose to the book all the time, even though there's, I don't know what the hell they were working on.

684
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:15,970
Scott: Like it was the weirdest thing.

685
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:17,529
Scott: I would, I would be in a class.

686
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:19,790
Scott: Someone else would be in the same class, right?

687
00:39:20,473 --> 00:39:24,110
Scott: I would've, I would've, you know, felt that I had no work to do for that class yet.

688
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:38,989
Scott: I would see someone else in that class with the book for that class, like in the library, spending a lot of time in there doing something, but at class, there are people in the dorms who'd be on those quiet floors and those people would just do work and they wouldn't do anything else.

689
00:39:39,391 --> 00:39:43,867
Rym: We're not talking about the quiet floors because I got to say, I know very little about them.

690
00:39:44,311 --> 00:39:50,450
Rym: I went to one a couple of times when I was working on a project with someone my freshman year, they were scary.

691
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:56,130
Rym: Like everyone in there was really, really scared except for like the three or four people who were stuck.

692
00:39:56,210 --> 00:40:03,510
Rym: Like they didn't want to be on that floor, but either their parents forced him to be on that floor or they ended up there because no one wanted to be on that floor.

693
00:40:04,451 --> 00:40:12,210
Rym: And basically those people never spend any time on that floor, but we could really only talk about our own doors because every dorm had its own character.

694
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:13,410
Scott: I know that's what it's all about.

695
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:15,890
Scott: I was just about to say the thing about floors, right?

696
00:40:16,111 --> 00:40:19,130
Scott: Each dorm, each floor, each section, right?

697
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:27,630
Scott: When however the dorms are architecturally structured, you know, each unit has its own character and its own community and its own attitude.

698
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:30,950
Rym: Well, it had its own name, its own RA, and then as a group, they had their own RD.

699
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:37,327
Rym: And we really only have experience with four of the dorm, I don't know, social units of RIT.

700
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:42,668
Scott: So I have some interactions with some other units, but yes, I know I'm most familiar with it.

701
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:48,970
Rym: I know them in the way that a visitor to a foreign land for a few weeks of a year knows the foreign land.

702
00:40:49,251 --> 00:40:50,970
Rym: I mean, here's what I know.

703
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:56,730
Rym: I mean, there are people who probably are nothing like the people, all the things we're going to talk about on all those other weird floors.

704
00:40:56,830 --> 00:41:12,109
Rym: But let me tell you, all I know about the study, the studying floors was that I never saw any of those people outside of those floors or outside of class, maybe in the library, but I only went in the library when I needed to sleep.

705
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:15,910
Scott: I went to the library, but not as much as some people.

706
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:21,170
Rym: Actually, you know, I can say I did a lot more work in the library for my elective classes than I ever did for anything else.

707
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:24,638
Scott: I did a lot more things in the library just for fun, looking around, because it's a big library.

708
00:41:24,658 --> 00:41:25,310
Scott: They got a lot of books.

709
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:26,628
Scott: There's a lot of weird stuff in there.

710
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:31,185
Rym: But I didn't get to pick my dorm and I didn't really like.

711
00:41:31,205 --> 00:41:34,390
Rym: I put in some preferences, but I tried to get into computer science house.

712
00:41:34,511 --> 00:41:35,469
Rym: Not going to talk about that.

713
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:37,048
Scott: No, I'm glad I didn't get in.

714
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:37,543
Scott: Me too.

715
00:41:38,272 --> 00:41:43,890
Rym: But I ended up in in one of the more infamous of the places to live at RIT.

716
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:45,106
Rym: I lived in Fish B.

717
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:46,730
Scott: Well, Fish B, too, right?

718
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:47,292
Rym: Fish B, too.

719
00:41:47,312 --> 00:41:59,130
Rym: Well, fish in and of itself was special because there was Fish A, which was completely separate from Fish B and C. And Fish A had the girls, but there's girls only.

720
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:06,249
Rym: In fact, Fish B was special in that I believe it housed the majority of the alcoholics at RIT at the time.

721
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:08,627
Scott: Fish, because it was all boys, wasn't it?

722
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:10,494
Rym: Fish B, I believe was all.

723
00:42:10,554 --> 00:42:17,249
Rym: fish B, too, however, was unique among RIT floors because most of RIT's dorms were unisex.

724
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:25,786
Scott: You know, you mean you didn't have girls and guys in the same room, you know, unless they signed up for it specifically or because everyone just swapped rooms and like hid it from the R.A.

725
00:42:25,806 --> 00:42:25,909
Rym: like.

726
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:27,309
Scott: Well, yeah, but you didn't have that.

727
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:30,810
Scott: RIT would never assign a strange guy and a strange girl to the same dorm.

728
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:36,810
Scott: You either did it on purpose or you signed up for it or something, but you would have a guy's room next to a girl's room.

729
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:39,929
Scott: You know, there wouldn't be any bathroom sharing going on.

730
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:44,570
Scott: But that's how most floors were, is that to be, you know, guys and girls on the same floor.

731
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:49,830
Scott: But Rym's dorm, Fish B, too, was guys, guys, guys in every room.

732
00:42:50,131 --> 00:42:50,816
Rym: Now, the other.

733
00:42:51,218 --> 00:42:53,050
Rym: there's a couple other things to note about Fish B, too.

734
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:56,509
Rym: Now, I'm not going to mention names, but we had our R.A.

735
00:42:57,312 --> 00:42:59,830
Rym: I will call him Eric and leave it at that.

736
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:00,848
Rym: I will not give his full name.

737
00:43:02,013 --> 00:43:03,986
Rym: The man was unique.

738
00:43:05,111 --> 00:43:07,203
Rym: Eric Big Shemmy's he.

739
00:43:07,223 --> 00:43:08,369
Rym: he I'll put it this way.

740
00:43:09,511 --> 00:43:14,630
Rym: He didn't get in my way and I didn't get in his way because I basically I was disconnected.

741
00:43:15,191 --> 00:43:18,850
Rym: The floor was around me, but I was not of the floor.

742
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:20,869
Rym: The floor attempted to bring me into it.

743
00:43:21,335 --> 00:43:22,570
Rym: I had nothing to do with this floor.

744
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:25,310
Scott: I just think your roommate didn't have anything to do with your floor either.

745
00:43:25,694 --> 00:43:26,490
Rym: But there's something cool.

746
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:30,650
Rym: There's almost this honor among thieves where crazy things happened on the floor.

747
00:43:31,011 --> 00:43:37,290
Rym: And a lot of the things to the outside observer would appear malicious, cruel, destructive, dangerous, horrifying.

748
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:40,720
Rym: However, it was all.

749
00:43:40,841 --> 00:43:48,150
Rym: I guess there's a quote from The Simpsons to us all in good fun because they only all did it to each other and they all took it with grace.

750
00:43:48,952 --> 00:43:53,209
Rym: And no one dished out anything that he did not expect to receive threefold in return.

751
00:43:54,172 --> 00:43:57,950
Rym: But no one ever did anything to me because I never did anything to anyone.

752
00:43:58,070 --> 00:44:06,087
Rym: I simply lived within these people, observe their culture like an anthropologist and one time woke up, Dr.

753
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:08,130
Scott: Remington, I presume to eight.

754
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:13,210
Rym: I opened my dorm room door on a Sunday morning to go out and get the Sunday brunch as I off did.

755
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:16,989
Rym: Me and Greg would often go down and eat fried eggs until we were too full to eat more fried eggs.

756
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:22,209
Rym: Wait any more hungry that you are.

757
00:44:23,031 --> 00:44:27,430
Rym: And I opened my dorm room door and a drunk person kind of collapses into the room.

758
00:44:27,511 --> 00:44:28,650
Rym: He's been, he's sleep.

759
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:32,170
Rym: He was sleeping against my door and your door opened inwards.

760
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:35,329
Rym: My door opened inward and he collapsed into my room, still asleep.

761
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:37,709
Rym: He had written on the whiteboard on my door.

762
00:44:38,231 --> 00:44:38,790
Rym: Let me in.

763
00:44:40,117 --> 00:44:40,709
Scott: Is this your roommate?

764
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:44,208
Rym: No, it was the dude who lived in the room next to me.

765
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:47,050
Rym: I don't know if he was confused or bored.

766
00:44:47,712 --> 00:44:51,129
Rym: I don't know if he thought let me in was somehow going to convince me to let him in.

767
00:44:52,251 --> 00:44:56,650
Rym: I kind of pushed him into the hallway and locked the door behind me and I wrote no on the whiteboard.

768
00:44:58,774 --> 00:44:59,384
Scott: That's a good one.

769
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:06,310
Rym: But Fishby too was connected to a building that had an elevator, but itself did not have an elevator.

770
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:08,650
Rym: So it was connected only on the third floor.

771
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:13,890
Rym: So basically there was no way in the world for a wheelchair to get to the second floor.

772
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:16,490
Rym: Yet we had a wheelchair accessible bathroom.

773
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:19,690
Scott: There was a way, just a very difficult way of lifting the wheelchair.

774
00:45:20,632 --> 00:45:25,970
Rym: Now after about a week, we had a, you see there were floor meetings as I'm sure all college kids are familiar with.

775
00:45:26,311 --> 00:45:31,770
Rym: But I skipped all of them when I realized right away that there were no possible repercussions.

776
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:34,190
Rym: What, they weren't going to kick me out of the dorm.

777
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:40,722
Rym: So once I realized that, I didn't go to the dorm meetings and Eric would always come and say, "Hey, you didn't go to the dorm meeting.

778
00:45:40,742 --> 00:45:41,065
Rym: You know, they're

779
00:45:41,085 --> 00:45:41,610
Rym: mandatory.".

780
00:45:41,751 --> 00:45:42,859
Rym: And I said, "Yeah, I know.

781
00:45:42,879 --> 00:45:43,624
Rym: I'll go to the next one.

782
00:45:43,664 --> 00:45:43,785
Rym: I'm

783
00:45:43,825 --> 00:45:44,168
Rym: sorry.".

784
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:47,790
Rym: But I didn't go to the next one and he'd say the same thing and I'd say the same thing.

785
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:51,970
Rym: And I got through the entirety of RIT's freshman year never going to these stupid floor meetings.

786
00:45:52,934 --> 00:45:53,829
Rym: I heard tell of them.

787
00:45:54,151 --> 00:46:02,950
Rym: There was one where we were, apparently the floor was admonished for the fact that both bathrooms had been completely filled with vomit, apparently at one point.

788
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:06,330
Rym: As in every sink was clogged with vomit and no one would fess up.

789
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:08,290
Scott: The drunkenest floor in the college.

790
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:12,269
Rym: No one would fess up and apparently the cleaning lady quit because of it.

791
00:46:12,736 --> 00:46:13,049
Scott: Awesome.

792
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:14,463
Rym: And they didn't know what to do and they...

793
00:46:15,253 --> 00:46:16,110
Scott: Hire a new cleaning lady.

794
00:46:16,451 --> 00:46:26,107
Rym: Apparently the argument from the floor was, "Well, you can either kick us all out or you can deny us the use of the bathrooms.

795
00:46:26,648 --> 00:46:27,689
Rym: I don't think either will end

796
00:46:27,729 --> 00:46:28,010
Rym: well.".

797
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:29,429
Scott: Yeah, we could have vomited elsewhere.

798
00:46:31,295 --> 00:46:32,590
Rym: I had nothing to do with these people.

799
00:46:34,271 --> 00:46:41,390
Rym: But the floor had kind of... See, I went to the secret meetings where the whole floor would get together and kind of have this rule of manly law.

800
00:46:42,052 --> 00:46:46,268
Rym: And everyone got together and decided that, "Here shall be the rules of the

801
00:46:46,308 --> 00:46:46,850
Rym: bathrooms.".

802
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:53,370
Rym: Because the other interesting point of Fish B2 was that there was a woman's bathroom, but there were no women.

803
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:56,289
Scott: And there was a handicapped bathroom, but no handicapped people.

804
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:58,729
Rym: So we had to decide what to do.

805
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:05,167
Rym: And one proposal was, "Leave the women's bathroom for women under the auspices that women would come to our

806
00:47:05,228 --> 00:47:05,549
Rym: floor.".

807
00:47:06,587 --> 00:47:06,670
Rym: Oh.

808
00:47:07,632 --> 00:47:09,902
Rym: The argument put forth in counter to that was that, "Ha!

809
00:47:10,224 --> 00:47:10,485
Rym: Fat

810
00:47:10,525 --> 00:47:10,867
Rym: chance!".

811
00:47:12,091 --> 00:47:23,949
Rym: And thus the agreement was such, "The handicapped bathroom shall be for women who visit, and people who are in need of privacy for matters that will be understood to be agreed upon by

812
00:47:24,169 --> 00:47:24,229
Rym: all.".

813
00:47:25,312 --> 00:47:26,470
Rym: Basically masturbation.

814
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:28,730
Scott: Or women who visit.

815
00:47:29,672 --> 00:47:30,234
Rym: Yes.

816
00:47:30,254 --> 00:47:33,570
Rym: Or someone who needs a private place, perhaps with a woman.

817
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:39,170
Rym: So that bathroom, let me tell you, was meticulously clean and there was a chair in there.

818
00:47:40,355 --> 00:47:41,470
Rym: It was rather large, actually.

819
00:47:42,251 --> 00:47:46,790
Rym: Actually, it was a full quarter the size of a dorm room, but I don't want to get into that.

820
00:47:47,713 --> 00:47:49,148
Rym: One guy moved into it for a little while.

821
00:47:50,491 --> 00:47:50,935
Scott: Okay.

822
00:47:51,358 --> 00:47:52,610
Scott: Weren't you taking your showers in there?

823
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:54,668
Rym: I took my showers in there for the longest time.

824
00:47:56,390 --> 00:48:00,916
Rym: But, henceforth, the bathroom signs were replaced with the... We made signs.

825
00:48:01,057 --> 00:48:02,466
Rym: One said, "Pisser

826
00:48:02,526 --> 00:48:02,848
Rym: Shitter.".

827
00:48:04,091 --> 00:48:04,494
Rym: No, no, no.

828
00:48:04,534 --> 00:48:05,219
Rym: It said, "Pisser

829
00:48:05,542 --> 00:48:06,085
Rym: Shower-er.".

830
00:48:06,247 --> 00:48:06,690
Rym: I'm sorry.

831
00:48:07,151 --> 00:48:10,507
Rym: And the second one said, "Pooper Vomiter," or "Shitter

832
00:48:10,547 --> 00:48:10,990
Rym: Vomiter."

833
00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:11,231
Rym: Exactly.

834
00:48:11,251 --> 00:48:13,805
Scott: The men's bathroom was the "Pisser

835
00:48:14,127 --> 00:48:14,589
Scott: Shower-er.".

836
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:18,070
Scott: So if you had to urinate or shower, you would go in there.

837
00:48:18,211 --> 00:48:18,870
Scott: But there was a rule.

838
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:21,650
Scott: If you had to shit or vomit, you would go in the women's bathroom.

839
00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:24,889
Rym: If you chose to poop in that bathroom, you were allowed to.

840
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:33,148
Rym: But if there was any trace, any evidence that you had pooped in there, you have committed a crime against the floor, we didn't ever decide what the punishment would be, but...

841
00:48:33,571 --> 00:48:36,250
Scott: Well, obviously retaliation threefold in kind.

842
00:48:36,390 --> 00:48:37,570
Rym: A retaliatory pooping?

843
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:38,213
Scott: Yes.

844
00:48:38,921 --> 00:48:39,810
Scott: Threefold pooping.

845
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:46,070
Rym: Despite all the antics, no one ever pooped in a way that was noticeable in that bathroom.

846
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:48,405
Scott: Yeah, because it was the "Pisser

847
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:48,809
Scott: Shower-er."

848
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:50,030
Scott: And everyone showered in that one.

849
00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:53,310
Scott: Even an animal knows not to, you know, shit in its shower.

850
00:48:54,872 --> 00:48:59,410
Rym: And then the other one, basically one bathroom was for nasty stuff and one was for slightly less nasty stuff.

851
00:48:59,490 --> 00:49:03,070
Rym: And of course, if all the showers were full, well, people would shower in the other one.

852
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:07,170
Rym: It was basically, if you can, use the nice bathroom for nice things.

853
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:10,430
Rym: If you can't, use the un-nice bathroom for nice things.

854
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:13,750
Rym: But woe betide he who does un-nice things in the nice bathroom.

855
00:49:15,293 --> 00:49:22,789
Rym: And it worked real well, because I gotta tell ya, all the stories I heard from everyone else in the dorms was that they could never take a shower because they were always full.

856
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:25,446
Rym: Because, of course, everyone's first class was at 10 AM.

857
00:49:30,292 --> 00:49:36,267
Scott: Yeah, see, I actually lived on "Peterson 3," which does not fish B2.

858
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:38,548
Rym: I spent most of my time on "Peterson

859
00:49:38,548 --> 00:49:38,790
Rym: 3.".

860
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:41,390
Rym: In fact, I slept in their lounge more than once.

861
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:47,249
Scott: It was an un-renovated dorm, one of the last un-renovated dorms there, which meant the rooms were bigger.

862
00:49:47,931 --> 00:49:51,270
Scott: There was no communal bathroom that had many, many shower stalls.

863
00:49:51,371 --> 00:49:54,390
Scott: We had one bathroom for two dorm rooms.

864
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:56,030
Scott: We had one shower in there.

865
00:49:56,070 --> 00:49:57,670
Scott: I think there might actually have been two showers in there.

866
00:49:57,730 --> 00:49:58,129
Scott: I don't remember.

867
00:49:58,871 --> 00:50:01,690
Scott: There was basically a shower, a toilet, and two sinks in there.

868
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:02,980
Scott: It was pretty good.

869
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:06,187
Scott: It was almost a private bathroom.

870
00:50:06,288 --> 00:50:06,550
Scott: Almost.

871
00:50:07,731 --> 00:50:09,348
Scott: It was a beautiful thing to live in "Peterson

872
00:50:09,348 --> 00:50:09,570
Scott: 3.".

873
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:12,209
Scott: "Peterson 3" was the "no drugs" floor.

874
00:50:13,972 --> 00:50:17,670
Scott: The complete opposite of fish B2, where there was vomiting and whatnot.

875
00:50:18,111 --> 00:50:20,070
Rym: It was called the "substance-free" floor.

876
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:22,428
Rym: It wasn't just like, "Yeah, we won't drink on the

877
00:50:22,448 --> 00:50:22,650
Rym: floor.".

878
00:50:22,752 --> 00:50:28,705
Rym: It was like, "All right, we know everyone's doing drugs and smoking pot, but don't do it in this

879
00:50:28,826 --> 00:50:29,169
Rym: floor.".

880
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:39,570
Scott: And not only that, but if you are drunk, and you return to the floor, that is a very bad idea, and you can actually get in serious shit.

881
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:40,905
Scott: So basically...

882
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:43,688
Rym: Well, RIT's serious shit was, "Well, you have to live somewhere else

883
00:50:43,748 --> 00:50:43,869
Rym: now.".

884
00:50:44,138 --> 00:50:44,310
Rym: Yeah.

885
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:56,006
Scott: So it was awesome, because I lived on this floor of all these people who didn't want to be drunk, didn't want to get stupid, and actually just wanted to be cool and have a good time.

886
00:50:57,070 --> 00:51:06,289
Scott: Now, the other thing is RIT is also home to the NTID, National Technical Institute for the Deaf, but half the people on the floor were deaf and half were not.

887
00:51:07,451 --> 00:51:12,866
Scott: So it was actually pretty cool, you know, half the people were just like, you know, they were deaf, and they were all like, "What's

888
00:51:12,948 --> 00:51:13,009
Scott: up?".

889
00:51:13,090 --> 00:51:16,270
Scott: Because they were the cool deaf people, not the drunken deaf people.

890
00:51:16,770 --> 00:51:20,570
Rym: Now, the thing is, the substance-free thing, whatever, I didn't care about that.

891
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:31,908
Rym: I mean, I kept wine in my room, and actually I left a very large red stain as a bottle of red wine exploded in my crappy little mini-fridge, because apparently it got set too cold and froze the thing.

892
00:51:32,871 --> 00:51:44,330
Rym: And my stupid roommate, who I never interacted with, I remember I got back, and there's this giant red stain on the floor, and he says, "Yeah, I heard a noise from your fridge, and that stuff started leaking out.

893
00:51:44,430 --> 00:51:49,298
Rym: I figured I'd leave it for, I didn't want to intrude upon your space or anything, so I didn't do

894
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:49,684
Rym: anything.".

895
00:51:50,852 --> 00:51:51,677
Rym: I was like, "Thanks, dude.

896
00:51:51,697 --> 00:51:52,583
Rym: That was

897
00:51:52,623 --> 00:51:52,865
Rym: great.".

898
00:51:53,833 --> 00:51:54,628
Scott: The winner is you.

899
00:51:55,311 --> 00:51:56,041
Rym: I didn't have to pay.

900
00:51:56,061 --> 00:51:57,789
Rym: I don't know why, but I never got billed for that.

901
00:51:57,930 --> 00:51:59,170
Scott: Yeah, my roommate was similar.

902
00:51:59,592 --> 00:52:08,610
Scott: He was a guy who was really interested in soccer, and I don't think he made the RIT soccer team, but he was always watching European soccer and stuff like that.

903
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:11,146
Scott: You're a geek about something.

904
00:52:11,207 --> 00:52:11,650
Scott: It's all good.

905
00:52:12,998 --> 00:52:13,550
Scott: We got along.

906
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:14,449
Scott: We didn't fight or anything.

907
00:52:14,792 --> 00:52:19,230
Scott: We both did our thing, and I think I got him to play a geeky card game once.

908
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:20,830
Scott: I think he played guillotine once or something.

909
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:25,443
Scott: But other than that, we didn't interact too much, and it was just all good.

910
00:52:25,605 --> 00:52:25,930
Scott: Whatever.

911
00:52:26,351 --> 00:52:28,029
Rym: Mine was a little weird step beyond that.

912
00:52:28,732 --> 00:52:30,069
Rym: I don't even remember the guy's name.

913
00:52:30,431 --> 00:52:34,390
Rym: We introduced each other, and our parents were there, and they talked to each other like, "Oh, what a nice young boy.

914
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:35,256
Rym: Oh, what a nice young boy.

915
00:52:35,276 --> 00:52:36,043
Rym: Yeah, they get along just

916
00:52:36,063 --> 00:52:36,325
Rym: fine.".

917
00:52:37,051 --> 00:52:42,010
Rym: And the only time we interacted... Well, we interacted three times in the entirety of the time.

918
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:42,686
Scott: The tribes do.

919
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:45,969
Rym: Well, I guess four times.

920
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:47,641
Rym: So time the one.

921
00:52:47,884 --> 00:52:48,349
Rym: We moved in.

922
00:52:48,491 --> 00:52:51,338
Rym: We set everything up, and we realized that the dorms were so small.

923
00:52:51,399 --> 00:52:52,569
Rym: We had one of the narrow dorms.

924
00:52:53,072 --> 00:52:54,000
Scott: The renovated dorms.

925
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:55,030
Scott: Yeah, the big dorm.

926
00:52:55,191 --> 00:52:55,889
Scott: Pre-renovation.

927
00:52:56,833 --> 00:52:58,126
Scott: Nothing was new and fancy.

928
00:52:58,146 --> 00:53:00,890
Scott: It was a little scuzzy and old, but it was bigger and better.

929
00:53:01,092 --> 00:53:01,919
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

930
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:06,809
Rym: But we realized that we could not both sit at our desks at the same time.

931
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:11,809
Rym: So we skewed everything to make sure that worked, and we had to talk while we moved the furniture around.

932
00:53:12,830 --> 00:53:16,189
Rym: And then when the wine exploded, I talked to him.

933
00:53:16,791 --> 00:53:26,210
Rym: When I jumped out of my bunk bed and landed on the floor and kind of hurt myself that one time, which I've told that story before, he asked me if I was alright.

934
00:53:27,072 --> 00:53:30,283
Rym: And then there was the time when we moved out, and I said, "Well, see

935
00:53:30,303 --> 00:53:30,485
Rym: ya.".

936
00:53:30,687 --> 00:53:34,465
Rym: And then he left, and then I lived in the dorm for four more days by myself.

937
00:53:34,505 --> 00:53:35,010
Rym: It was great.

938
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:35,603
Scott: Yeah.

939
00:53:37,070 --> 00:53:42,081
Scott: The dorm, the size of the dorm I lived in, if it had been anywhere else, would have had three people in it, but it only had two.

940
00:53:42,748 --> 00:53:43,354
Scott: It was wonderful.

941
00:53:43,495 --> 00:53:50,649
Rym: You could fit four of the RIT narrow dorms in the living room of our house with room to spare.

942
00:53:51,130 --> 00:53:51,494
Scott: Easily.

943
00:53:51,514 --> 00:53:54,227
Rym: And two people lived in each of these things.

944
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:55,658
Rym: They were not large.

945
00:53:57,794 --> 00:54:04,530
Scott: No, and that is why the furniture is such that, you know, the bed goes above the desk, and the closet is sort of built in there.

946
00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:21,558
Rym: But it was funny, the kind of honor among, like, the expected protocols that everyone, everyone, every guy hosted their class schedule, kind of like, not like publicly like, "Here's my class schedule," but everyone always put it out so that the roommate could, with very little snooping, kind of just look at it.

947
00:54:22,268 --> 00:54:30,010
Rym: And for anyone who hasn't been to college yet, this is for no purpose other than to determine the masturbatory schedule.

948
00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:37,013
Scott: Yeah, there's nothing worse than, you know, getting your groove on and then- And hearing that jingle, jingle, jingle.

949
00:54:37,155 --> 00:54:39,845
Scott: Yeah, hearing the jingle of keys getting ready to open the door.

950
00:54:39,906 --> 00:54:49,297
Rym: However, every time you return home to your dorm room, and you're supposed to be at class, you always took some extra time jiggling the door, just, you know, just in case.

951
00:54:49,338 --> 00:54:59,500
Rym: Give the person some time, because you know what they're doing, and when you walk in, they know that you know, but there's kind of this unspoken, well, it's not even kind of, it was unspoken.

952
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:00,814
Rym: No one ever made reference to it.

953
00:55:01,925 --> 00:55:03,136
Scott: Nope, no one ever said anything.

954
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:05,358
Rym: But it's weird how everyone kind of just did it.

955
00:55:05,378 --> 00:55:06,935
Scott: I actually had a close call once.

956
00:55:06,955 --> 00:55:10,895
Rym: I had a couple close calls, because my man liked to skip class.

957
00:55:11,723 --> 00:55:12,955
Scott: Who didn't like to skip class?

958
00:55:13,319 --> 00:55:18,309
Rym: I skipped class a lot more than him, but somehow he always skipped, like, when I was in there masturbating.

959
00:55:19,235 --> 00:55:19,709
Scott: All right.

960
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:29,770
Rym: But I hung out in Scott's dorm, and eventually, actually Peterson 3 became the hangout of the front row crew.

961
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:37,425
Scott: Well, also, because remember, every dorm has a lounge, and lounge is key, because some people are the kind of people who use the lounges, and some people are not, right?

962
00:55:37,465 --> 00:55:39,710
Scott: And the lounge is sort of a first come, first serve thing.

963
00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:45,204
Scott: It's like, if your group of friends is in there, everyone else has got to find somewhere else to go.

964
00:55:45,224 --> 00:55:50,390
Rym: And no one ever came in and kicked people out, but it was just the people in there were made so uncomfortable.

965
00:55:50,852 --> 00:55:51,340
Rym: Right.

966
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:58,435
Scott: You could come in and use the microwave if someone else was hanging out in there, but you couldn't bring your friends to hang out if someone else's friends were hanging out.

967
00:55:58,455 --> 00:56:04,495
Scott: You didn't know each other, you know, unless you wanted to, you know, sort of get in on whatever their activity was, which happened, I guess, a couple times.

968
00:56:04,596 --> 00:56:07,343
Rym: Yeah, that's how many people joined the front row crew.

969
00:56:07,363 --> 00:56:14,534
Scott: But you don't come in and try to have your activity side by side with someone else's existing activity, and you don't come in and try to display someone's activity.

970
00:56:14,574 --> 00:56:19,590
Scott: You either come in and join the existing lounge activity or you don't go in the lounge.

971
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:26,050
Rym: But it was like this force of will where whichever group had the stronger force of will just laid claim and no one ever questioned it.

972
00:56:26,110 --> 00:56:27,102
Rym: There was never an argument.

973
00:56:27,162 --> 00:56:29,301
Rym: No one ever said, "Hey, can we use the lounge?

974
00:56:29,381 --> 00:56:30,189
Rym: Hey, blah, blah, blah.

975
00:56:30,511 --> 00:56:31,140
Rym: Hey, you guys are

976
00:56:31,181 --> 00:56:31,424
Rym: loud.".

977
00:56:31,464 --> 00:56:35,369
Rym: It was just one group remain- two groups enter, one group remains.

978
00:56:36,270 --> 00:56:41,909
Rym: But Peterson 3 became the hangout primarily because there was this thing in the corner of the room.

979
00:56:42,492 --> 00:56:45,710
Scott: Yeah, the lounge, you know, was old, so it was bigger, right?

980
00:56:45,810 --> 00:56:51,089
Scott: It had a TV just like every other lounge, right, with a VCR and cable, you know, provided by the school.

981
00:56:52,330 --> 00:56:58,982
Scott: But in the corner of the room, right, because it was like the way the building was, there was a storage closet next to the lounge.

982
00:56:59,446 --> 00:57:03,770
Scott: So in the corner of the lounge, there was like this weird terraced block.

983
00:57:04,012 --> 00:57:06,030
Scott: It was like three steps and then a landing.

984
00:57:06,614 --> 00:57:07,687
Rym: I think there was like a pipe.

985
00:57:07,727 --> 00:57:08,678
Rym: There was something under it.

986
00:57:08,718 --> 00:57:09,850
Scott: There had to be something under it.

987
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:17,061
Scott: I think it might have been the storage closet or who knows what was under there, but there was just like this little terraced step in the corner of the room.

988
00:57:17,081 --> 00:57:18,050
Rym: It was pretty tall, too.

989
00:57:18,110 --> 00:57:19,350
Rym: It was like four and a half feet tall.

990
00:57:19,992 --> 00:57:24,496
Scott: You could, you know, it was sort of like, "Hey, we could like have the DM sit up there.

991
00:57:24,516 --> 00:57:24,678
Scott: It'd be

992
00:57:24,718 --> 00:57:24,900
Scott: cool.".

993
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:32,558
Rym: Basically, the Dungeon Master sat up there, and it's weird, when we weren't playing D&D, no one sat there.

994
00:57:33,246 --> 00:57:35,808
Rym: Like, if you or I guess if you were telling a story sometimes, you'd sit there.

995
00:57:35,828 --> 00:57:39,364
Scott: If you ran out of room in the room and you're out of places to sit, some people would go up there.

996
00:57:39,445 --> 00:57:39,910
Rym: But rarely.

997
00:57:40,152 --> 00:57:52,555
Rym: Usually, the only time someone was there is if they had, for whatever reason, either playing D&D or telling a story or whatever, if they were kind of the master of ceremonies, they had the control of the zeitgeist of the room at the moment.

998
00:57:52,918 --> 00:57:55,007
Rym: It was kind of like the speaker's podium or the soapbox.

999
00:57:56,350 --> 00:57:58,314
Scott: Oftentimes, we'd put the little TV there.

1000
00:57:59,141 --> 00:58:02,940
Rym: Yes, we would, because the little TV, when we were using it, had control of the room.

1001
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:07,304
Scott: Yeah, because remember, there was a VCR, I think, in the lounge, or wasn't there?

1002
00:58:07,344 --> 00:58:10,233
Rym: No, there wasn't, but I brought a VCR with me.

1003
00:58:10,274 --> 00:58:11,061
Scott: Oh, that's right.

1004
00:58:11,081 --> 00:58:12,455
Scott: I said the lounge had a VCR.

1005
00:58:12,516 --> 00:58:13,162
Scott: Actually, I was wrong.

1006
00:58:13,203 --> 00:58:13,768
Scott: It did not.

1007
00:58:13,829 --> 00:58:24,938
Scott: So, we would bring a VCR sometimes, but if we didn't, my roommate had brought a tiny TV with built-in VCR and we'd carry it to the lounge and watch things on this incredibly tiny television.

1008
00:58:25,746 --> 00:58:26,190
Rym: It was great.

1009
00:58:26,330 --> 00:58:28,517
Scott: Mostly anime from the Anime Club library on VHS.

1010
00:58:28,638 --> 00:58:29,670
Rym: Oh my God, those were good days.

1011
00:58:30,373 --> 00:58:32,536
Rym: We were pretty much our schedule on an average day.

1012
00:58:32,556 --> 00:58:34,980
Scott: That was also the last time I had cables and I lived in those dorms.

1013
00:58:35,001 --> 00:58:37,505
Rym: Yeah, but we'd show up, you know, we'd wake up.

1014
00:58:37,526 --> 00:58:43,080
Scott: I paid for that cable, half of it, every freaking quarter, but I never used it and the other guy only used it to watch Italian soccer.

1015
00:58:43,585 --> 00:58:47,429
Rym: We'd wake up and we'd, like, on a given day that wasn't a club night or something, we'd all go to class

1016
00:58:48,272 --> 00:58:48,495
Scott: and then

1017
00:58:48,535 --> 00:58:56,414
Rym: we'd all, like, do our thing and we might see each other for lunch or whatever, front row crew, all this business, and then, you know, a few of us worked, but most of us didn't have jobs.

1018
00:58:56,475 --> 00:58:59,465
Rym: We just had no money and no jobs and didn't care, and then we'd

1019
00:58:59,566 --> 00:59:00,515
Scott: all kind of

1020
00:59:01,181 --> 00:59:01,969
Rym: converge on

1021
00:59:03,130 --> 00:59:03,770
Scott: Gracie's around

1022
00:59:04,033 --> 00:59:17,244
Rym: like six o'clock, six thirty, seven, and the time would slowly shift, but the whole front row crew and, like, all the kind of attached crews, because that was kind of the peak of our crew before the front row crew kind of fully distilled out

1023
00:59:17,264 --> 00:59:17,426
Scott: of it.

1024
00:59:17,446 --> 00:59:18,961
Scott: Before we distilled and condensed.

1025
00:59:19,426 --> 00:59:24,961
Rym: There were a good twenty to thirty people at the absolute peak who would kind of congregate around the front row crew.

1026
00:59:24,982 --> 00:59:26,981
Scott: Yeah, I don't know what happened to a lot of those people.

1027
00:59:27,244 --> 00:59:35,184
Rym: Well, it was kind of like the front row crew was the core and there was this large, like, tertiary group around it that would follow us.

1028
00:59:35,507 --> 00:59:41,144
Rym: Like, wherever we gathered, like, all those other people would kind of gather around us, but we were always there.

1029
00:59:41,245 --> 00:59:44,538
Rym: We always got wherever we were going first and left last.

1030
00:59:44,921 --> 00:59:45,688
Rym: It was kind of weird.

1031
00:59:45,709 --> 01:00:03,149
Rym: Like, we'd all go to the quad and hang out on The Thing, which was the common pastime outside when it wasn't, you know, as cold, and then that group would kind of find out we were there and converge around us and we'd all hang out, and then it'd all eventually leave, and then it'd be back to the core group again for another couple hours.

1032
01:00:03,930 --> 01:00:07,686
Rym: But we'd all go to Gracie's, which we could do a whole show on.

1033
01:00:07,726 --> 01:00:09,687
Rym: Gracie's in and of itself, I think, but...

1034
01:00:09,970 --> 01:00:10,657
Scott: I don't know about that.

1035
01:00:10,698 --> 01:00:11,506
Scott: It's a cafeteria.

1036
01:00:11,546 --> 01:00:12,496
Scott: How much is there to say?

1037
01:00:12,718 --> 01:00:13,283
Rym: A lot of things.

1038
01:00:13,303 --> 01:00:14,920
Rym: Remember when that dude stole my hat?

1039
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:15,830
Scott: Alright.

1040
01:00:16,591 --> 01:00:17,363
Scott: The dude stole your hat.

1041
01:00:17,384 --> 01:00:17,749
Scott: The end.

1042
01:00:18,130 --> 01:00:19,647
Rym: Remember Steve Towell?

1043
01:00:20,070 --> 01:00:21,670
Rym: The, uh, the spectacle?

1044
01:00:22,050 --> 01:00:23,770
Rym: I don't know if you were there for the spectacle.

1045
01:00:24,431 --> 01:00:24,795
Rym: I don't know.

1046
01:00:25,584 --> 01:00:28,879
Rym: The spectacle, if you don't remember the spectacle, you weren't there.

1047
01:00:29,283 --> 01:00:50,674
Rym: But, uh, we would go there, we'd all eat, and then we'd kind of wait for the people we didn't want to hang out with to give up and leave, and then we'd all go to Peterson 3, hang out until, like, 1150, and then, oh shit, the core's closing, and we'd run down to the corner store, Scott and I would buy Red Baron's Four Cheese Pizza, and everyone else had their own kind of ritualistic food.

1048
01:00:51,281 --> 01:00:54,556
Rym: We'd go back, we'd all microwave our various ritualistic foods.

1049
01:00:54,678 --> 01:00:55,230
Scott: I'm real hungry.

1050
01:00:55,914 --> 01:01:02,709
Rym: We'd eat them, and then we'd hang out until about 1.32, 3 in the morning, and then we'd all go to bed and skip our next, you know, day's classes.

1051
01:01:04,794 --> 01:01:17,713
Rym: Man, I really suddenly have all this nostalgia for hanging out in Peterson 3, but eventually, there was this whole shuffle where some of our friends like Alex and Pete had to move dorms because they were renovating dorms in the course of school.

1052
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:22,704
Rym: So they eventually moved into the new dorm, the new tower, Sol 8.

1053
01:01:22,704 --> 01:01:34,724
Rym: And we kind of replaced Peterson 3 with Sol 8 because the lounge there, while it didn't have the thing, was a lot bigger, had a better TV, had better couches, the microwave worked a lot better, and it didn't smell funny.

1054
01:01:34,764 --> 01:01:39,010
Scott: Yeah, we usually did, you know, anime marathons there, because that was a renovated dorm.

1055
01:01:39,310 --> 01:01:44,292
Rym: Yep, but if we had to play D&D, we still went back to Peterson 3.

1056
01:01:44,292 --> 01:01:44,579
Scott: Yeah.

1057
01:01:44,661 --> 01:01:55,290
Scott: Actually, while we were at RIT, right, they renovated this one dorm, so actually we had people who started out living in one dorm that had to move to the one that was finished being renovated.

1058
01:01:55,651 --> 01:01:57,470
Rym: Those were Pete, you know, all the people we were talking about.

1059
01:01:57,470 --> 01:01:59,450
Scott: Yeah, they were living in Ellington, which is un-renovated.

1060
01:02:00,030 --> 01:02:05,269
Scott: Then, they finished renovating Sol, these people from Ellington moved to Sol, then they started renovating Ellington.

1061
01:02:07,156 --> 01:02:09,066
Rym: And of course, I mean, man, we used to do a lot of it.

1062
01:02:09,086 --> 01:02:18,077
Rym: Like, we used to, like, eventually we'd get bored and we'd get this wanderlust, and we'd like, wander into all the tunnels, because half the tunnels under the dorms at that time in RIT were abandoned.

1063
01:02:18,097 --> 01:02:23,650
Rym: Like, there was old stuff down there, like, the old nightclub that was closed, and the old arcade that was closed.

1064
01:02:23,910 --> 01:02:28,399
Scott: Yeah, it's like you went down to these dorms and there was, like, relics of, like, a college in the past.

1065
01:02:28,459 --> 01:02:30,461
Scott: It's the kind of thing that always gets me upset.

1066
01:02:30,481 --> 01:02:38,279
Scott: It's like, you see things that tell you, they let you know clearly that awesome was here, awesome is now gone.

1067
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:54,804
Rym: There were nightclubs, bars, arcades, like, rooms we weren't even sure what they were for, stores that hadn't been open since, like, the 60s or 70s, tunnels that were cut off, fully functioning bathrooms in parts of the tunnels that didn't even have power.

1068
01:02:54,965 --> 01:02:56,117
Rym: Like, it was weird.

1069
01:02:56,461 --> 01:03:08,682
Scott: There was, you know, because the renovations, this tunnel system under all the dorms actually was split in half for a time, and you could only get from one area to the other, and people only really went down there to do laundry, and then that was it.

1070
01:03:09,288 --> 01:03:10,863
Scott: But, you know, there's the corners there.

1071
01:03:10,883 --> 01:03:11,106
Scott: Well, well,

1072
01:03:11,289 --> 01:03:23,510
Rym: and we went down there to do laundry, but in my side, at least, because I was connected, basically, there were the tunnels that actually connected to everything, and then there were kind of the bastardized tunnels that would connect to everything, but it was cut off for the renovation.

1073
01:03:24,011 --> 01:03:27,870
Rym: And Peterson was connected to those, but I was connected to, I guess, the real tunnels.

1074
01:03:28,293 --> 01:03:39,490
Rym: You could get between all the different dorms, except for the ones under renovation, and all the way to Gracie's, and all the way to the frat houses, and a large portion of the way to the academic side, without ever setting foot outdoors.

1075
01:03:39,970 --> 01:03:40,901
Scott: And this is key.

1076
01:03:41,447 --> 01:03:44,850
Scott: This is very key, because Rochester is fucking cold in the winter.

1077
01:03:45,710 --> 01:03:59,930
Rym: You would plot out, like, exactly how far can I get before I have to step outside, and then what is the quickest way to get back inside at the other side of the buildings, where, you know, the academic side had its own set of tunnels.

1078
01:04:00,331 --> 01:04:03,770
Rym: And you try to get from one tunnel to the other tunnel as quickly as possible.

1079
01:04:03,850 --> 01:04:05,289
Scott: The post office is also down there.

1080
01:04:05,590 --> 01:04:07,429
Rym: Yeah, it was, and a lot of other cool stuff.

1081
01:04:08,630 --> 01:04:10,960
Scott: But anyway, yeah, exploring those tunnels, man.

1082
01:04:11,223 --> 01:04:12,497
Scott: Well, not so much exploring.

1083
01:04:12,921 --> 01:04:15,002
Scott: They were really quick to explore all of them.

1084
01:04:15,042 --> 01:04:16,255
Rym: But we'd wander around.

1085
01:04:16,276 --> 01:04:19,909
Scott: Going down there and checking stuff out and seeing what was up was good times.

1086
01:04:20,410 --> 01:04:22,315
Rym: And, like, we'd get bored and just kind of wander around.

1087
01:04:22,336 --> 01:04:31,790
Rym: I remember that one time we found, they built, like, for some reason, they made a really fancy new conference room down there, like, in the middle of effectively abandoned tunnels.

1088
01:04:32,614 --> 01:04:34,520
Rym: And they left it open one day, and we found it.

1089
01:04:35,068 --> 01:04:41,287
Rym: So, we rigged one of the other doors, there were two doors to this place, so it looked like it was closed and locked, but we could still get in.

1090
01:04:42,370 --> 01:04:45,569
Rym: And then, for a while, we would go down there to play BattleTech.

1091
01:04:46,231 --> 01:04:50,596
Scott: Yeah, big conference room table, tunnels, night, no one's down there.

1092
01:04:50,616 --> 01:04:53,022
Scott: Whiteboards, why not play BattleTech?

1093
01:04:53,103 --> 01:04:53,670
Rym: It was really cool.

1094
01:04:53,810 --> 01:04:59,429
Rym: It was kind of like this, like, it was basically our tree fort, because we'd lock ourselves in there.

1095
01:05:00,032 --> 01:05:04,819
Rym: And, you know, it was quiet outside, like, there'd never be anyone in those tunnels, except every now and then the security guy.

1096
01:05:05,304 --> 01:05:09,790
Rym: But we were cut off from everyone in our own private hangout, no one knew we were there, and the door was locked.

1097
01:05:10,190 --> 01:05:11,067
Rym: No one could bother us.

1098
01:05:12,212 --> 01:05:18,229
Rym: Eventually, someone must have found the tape we'd put in the rigged door, because one day we couldn't get in anymore, and we never got into that room again.

1099
01:05:18,952 --> 01:05:19,297
Scott: Yeah.

1100
01:05:19,318 --> 01:05:23,062
Scott: But no, dorms are all about staying inside, not going outside.

1101
01:05:23,102 --> 01:05:29,930
Scott: You know, you've got the wicked fast internet connection, you've got plenty of people, you've got access to food without going outside.

1102
01:05:30,210 --> 01:05:33,326
Scott: You don't have to worry about money or anything, right?

1103
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:38,856
Scott: So, it's all about just getting everything done, doing your whole life awesome, just in a building.

1104
01:05:38,876 --> 01:05:42,410
Scott: It's good preparation for the arcology living of the future.

1105
01:05:42,630 --> 01:05:46,837
Rym: But you're so isolated, and, you know, you're all together, and you're all geeks, and you're bored.

1106
01:05:47,261 --> 01:06:00,009
Rym: So as a result, I think that's part of the reason why the front row crew is so close and so family-like, is that we basically lived on a space station, isolated from all other people for long stretches of time, with nothing but other geeks around.

1107
01:06:01,679 --> 01:06:04,249
Rym: And, ugh, man, they were good times, let me tell you.

1108
01:06:04,633 --> 01:06:18,030
Scott: Yeah, that's sort of why I want to make, like, a geek apartment complex or building or something like that, you know, to sort of, you know, give people who are not, you know, RIT CS students the opportunity to have that kind of living.

1109
01:06:18,370 --> 01:06:40,350
Rym: In the deadest dead of winter, no one had Friday classes, so Friday morning, like, we'd all get up and get, you know, lunch, well, breakfast at like one o'clock or whatever, and we would all not set foot outside until Monday when we had to go to class again, and we'd all eat at Gracie's, like, you know, breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the whole weekend, and we'd, like, marathon a bunch of anime, like, we'd watch 13 episodes of a show on Saturday.

1110
01:06:40,591 --> 01:06:51,966
Scott: And you had not a care in the world, nothing else to do, nothing else to think about, nothing in the way, no real life, you know, you did your laundry, you did a little bit of homework, you know, to pass class, and then, what else did you have to do?

1111
01:06:52,067 --> 01:06:52,350
Scott: Nothing.

1112
01:06:52,810 --> 01:07:08,676
Rym: What I really miss is that by having no other concerns, I mean, you're a freshman too, so it's not even like the future is looming, nothing's looming, so everything I did was something I wanted to do, and I wasted a lot of time, but I wasted it purposefully.

1113
01:07:08,777 --> 01:07:14,815
Rym: I used to always tell people about the slacker spirit and become infused with the slacker spirit, and the slacker spirit is this.

1114
01:07:15,682 --> 01:07:22,530
Rym: If you are going to dick around and waste time and just enjoy yourself, do it wholeheartedly.

1115
01:07:23,092 --> 01:07:24,815
Rym: Don't worry about anything else in the world.

1116
01:07:24,936 --> 01:07:27,179
Rym: If you're gonna skip class, don't worry about class.

1117
01:07:27,381 --> 01:07:52,130
Rym: If you're gonna waste an entire weekend, don't even think of it as wasted, just do what you wanna do, and I would watch 20 hours of anime over the course of a weekend, as in, we'd marathon a whole show, and then like on Sunday we'd watch a bunch of other anime, and play some D&D in between all those things, and not get anything done, and at no point in those 20 hours did I ever think I could be spending this time better.

1118
01:07:52,531 --> 01:07:56,066
Rym: In fact, at best, I would think, "Man, are these the best days of my

1119
01:07:56,107 --> 01:07:56,309
Rym: life.".

1120
01:07:56,932 --> 01:08:03,158
Scott: Yeah, I mean, if you cut class to play Tribes 2 and the whole time you're like, "I shouldn't have skipped that

1121
01:08:03,218 --> 01:08:03,603
Scott: class.".

1122
01:08:03,623 --> 01:08:04,170
Scott: You were nervous.

1123
01:08:05,051 --> 01:08:06,230
Scott: You should have just gone to the class.

1124
01:08:06,856 --> 01:08:07,507
Scott: You wasted it.

1125
01:08:08,412 --> 01:08:11,966
Rym: The fact that nothing ever distracted me from what I was doing at RIT.

1126
01:08:12,430 --> 01:08:15,520
Rym: That is one thing that I had, and I don't have that anymore.

1127
01:08:15,561 --> 01:08:16,590
Rym: Maybe it's because I'm ambitious.

1128
01:08:17,170 --> 01:08:21,970
Rym: Like, even now, I'm at work, I'm working on work, but I'm also thinking about what I'm gonna do with GeekNights.

1129
01:08:22,451 --> 01:08:23,560
Rym: I'm at home, I'm doing GeekNights.

1130
01:08:23,582 --> 01:08:25,621
Rym: I'm thinking about what I'm gonna eat when I finish this show.

1131
01:08:26,064 --> 01:08:33,743
Rym: When I'm playing Natural Selection, I'm thinking about I'll look at the clock and think, "Well, in an hour, I should probably stop playing NS so that I can do

1132
01:08:33,763 --> 01:08:33,783
Rym: X.".

1133
01:08:34,572 --> 01:08:40,130
Rym: At RIT, I would skip class, I'd come home to the dorm, I'd start playing Natural Selection.

1134
01:08:40,974 --> 01:08:42,906
Rym: I would stop when I was done.

1135
01:08:44,612 --> 01:08:46,330
Rym: I didn't even think, "When's my next

1136
01:08:46,411 --> 01:08:46,714
Rym: class?".

1137
01:08:46,795 --> 01:08:47,805
Rym: I thought, "I'm playing

1138
01:08:47,867 --> 01:08:48,149
Rym: NS.".

1139
01:08:48,493 --> 01:08:49,804
Rym: At some point, I would stop NS.

1140
01:08:50,207 --> 01:08:53,175
Rym: I'd look at the clock and go, "Oh shit, it's 8 o'clock.

1141
01:08:54,041 --> 01:08:54,363
Rym: Fuck.".

1142
01:08:55,553 --> 01:08:57,886
Rym: And then I'd say, "Well, I already missed class, better go get

1143
01:08:57,907 --> 01:08:58,050
Rym: dinner.".

1144
01:08:58,050 --> 01:09:00,569
Scott: -I don't think we were playing NS when we were in the dorms.

1145
01:09:00,670 --> 01:09:01,296
Scott: It wasn't out yet.

1146
01:09:01,317 --> 01:09:02,470
Rym: -Might not have been, I don't remember.

1147
01:09:02,729 --> 01:09:03,801
Scott: -It wasn't until we were living in the apartment.

1148
01:09:03,823 --> 01:09:05,317
Rym: -We were, however, playing tribes.

1149
01:09:05,337 --> 01:09:06,488
Scott: -We were playing tribes, too.

1150
01:09:06,729 --> 01:09:08,290
Rym: -But I did the same thing in the apartment.

1151
01:09:08,852 --> 01:09:10,085
Rym: That's not a dorm-only thing.

1152
01:09:10,125 --> 01:09:11,520
Rym: That was a RIT thing.

1153
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:13,640
Scott: -Well, I think it's an A college thing.

1154
01:09:13,662 --> 01:09:14,430
Rym: -Yeah, well, it depends.

1155
01:09:14,511 --> 01:09:15,337
Scott: -Can I eat now?

1156
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:16,953
Rym: -Oh, you wanna stop doing the show?

1157
01:09:16,974 --> 01:09:17,742
Scott: -I'm just hungry.

1158
01:09:17,761 --> 01:09:22,249
Rym: -Alright, I'll tell you this, 'cause we have a lot of anecdotes about RIT in the dorms, and I just wanna hear this.

1159
01:09:23,091 --> 01:09:32,750
Rym: All of you out there, you GeekKnives listeners, do you want more, maybe a better-produced episode, as opposed to this kind of, "Ah, we're tired and we're kinda just winging the episode,".

1160
01:09:32,810 --> 01:09:35,357
Rym: but do you wanna hear more anecdotes from RIT?

1161
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:36,490
Rym: Because we got a lot.

1162
01:09:36,609 --> 01:09:50,270
Scott: -People seem to just love anecdotes shows, but I feel like we should have more substance in it, and yet again, much like someone who, you know, "Ah, you know, is thinking about what they should've gone to class while they were skipping it," right?

1163
01:09:51,212 --> 01:09:53,801
Scott: I am thinking, "Ah, we should do a show with substance while we're doing a crab people

1164
01:09:53,821 --> 01:09:53,902
Scott: show.".

1165
01:09:53,921 --> 01:10:02,444
Rym: -Of course, at the same time, I'm kinda tired this week, but that's just an unrelated thing, so I'm just waiting for the show to be done, 'cause then all I have to do is FNPL tomorrow, and then, uh...

1166
01:10:02,464 --> 01:10:07,638
Scott: -Yeah, it's weird, Thursday is our most flexible day, yet it's the hardest day to actually come up with what to do the show on.

1167
01:10:08,002 --> 01:10:13,901
Scott: Maybe we should just do a lot more, maybe we should just do a lot, I'm reading a lot of books, maybe we should just turn Thursday into book day.

1168
01:10:14,224 --> 01:10:15,074
Scott: Maybe that'll get people to read.

1169
01:10:15,094 --> 01:10:16,250
Rym: -No, because no one seems to read the books.

1170
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:18,450
Scott: -Maybe if we just kept doing it, people would fuckin' read.

1171
01:10:18,990 --> 01:10:29,543
Rym: -But I feel like, I don't know, maybe, would you guys like it if we just did a Thursday that was just, like, we'll turn into a series, we won't do it all the time, we'll do it sparingly, I don't wanna waste it, kinda like those zombie shows.

1172
01:10:29,563 --> 01:10:32,510
Scott: -I don't know, I think we already told most of the anecdotes we got.

1173
01:10:32,670 --> 01:10:33,763
Rym: -I haven't by far.

1174
01:10:33,783 --> 01:10:35,279
Scott: -What do you gotta talk about?

1175
01:10:35,299 --> 01:10:36,289
Rym: -I got a lot to say.

1176
01:10:36,890 --> 01:10:39,569
Rym: Chris, I've always been more of the anecdote-tician than you.

1177
01:10:40,491 --> 01:10:46,410
Scott: -I don't know, what anecdote do I have that I haven't already used, you know, only so many things happened that were memorable.

1178
01:10:46,590 --> 01:10:58,590
Scott: I mean, some of them were perhaps memorable, but there's really, you know, it's what, it's sort of those, you can't really tell a story about it, it's a "had to be there" thing, you know, it's like, "Hey, remember that time we sat there and watched Ava

1179
01:10:58,671 --> 01:10:59,036
Scott: straight?".

1180
01:10:59,300 --> 01:10:59,989
Scott: It's like, yeah, we did.

1181
01:11:00,871 --> 01:11:01,134
Scott: Okay.

1182
01:11:01,579 --> 01:11:02,529
Scott: What else is there to say about it?

1183
01:11:02,590 --> 01:11:04,750
Rym: -I guess you just don't have the gift of the storyteller.

1184
01:11:05,610 --> 01:11:08,450
Scott: -Dude, I can tell a great story, that has to be a story to tell.

1185
01:11:08,670 --> 01:11:10,734
Scott: It's unlike you, I don't make up stuff.

1186
01:11:10,754 --> 01:11:13,509
Rym: -Except I don't have to make anything up when I'm talking about RIT.

1187
01:11:14,494 --> 01:11:15,410
Rym: God, I have hours.

1188
01:11:17,150 --> 01:11:25,016
Rym: More happened in terms of just memorable events in the few years at RIT than have happened in many other periods of my life.

1189
01:11:25,036 --> 01:11:30,570
Scott: -Yeah, there was a lot that happened but I can't, you know, there's not that much of it that it can be a whole series of shows.

1190
01:11:31,231 --> 01:11:35,239
Scott: We've already used a lot of it in the early shows of GeekNights that many people haven't listened to.

1191
01:11:35,259 --> 01:11:39,136
Rym: -Yeah, and we could probably just tell them again, better and more experienced podcasters that we are.

1192
01:11:39,156 --> 01:11:43,609
Scott: -I think we could tell them again better podcast wise but less memory wise.

1193
01:11:44,291 --> 01:11:45,743
Rym: -I don't seem to have this problem.

1194
01:11:45,763 --> 01:11:47,925
Scott: -It was three years ago, the GeekNights.

1195
01:11:47,945 --> 01:11:49,670
Scott: -Anyway -And we talked about that shit.

1196
01:11:50,450 --> 01:11:52,210
Rym: -Okay, I don't know, what do you guys want?

1197
01:11:52,330 --> 01:11:57,950
Rym: Because I feel like what we could do is -You don't need to ask the people, the people always say yes, anecdotes.

1198
01:11:58,630 --> 01:12:00,290
Scott: They just want all anecdotes all the time.

1199
01:12:00,330 --> 01:12:04,066
Rym: -I want to hear it from them because I'm willing to put forth at least a token effort here.

1200
01:12:04,106 --> 01:12:08,309
Rym: Basically we said we're going to change up the Thursday format and we really haven't yet.

1201
01:12:08,430 --> 01:12:09,298
Scott: -No, we failed.

1202
01:12:09,318 --> 01:12:13,802
Rym: -But I feel like every Thursday we should just do something weird in story time or whatever.

1203
01:12:13,863 --> 01:12:21,317
Rym: but I feel like we could do a short series of vignettes just about you know, what it was like to be us at RIT.

1204
01:12:21,357 --> 01:12:29,541
Rym: Not the how to not sucks where we try to kind of tell a story about us or someone we knew and then try to use it as a parable for life.

1205
01:12:30,126 --> 01:12:30,470
Rym: Or not.

1206
01:12:30,551 --> 01:12:33,459
Rym: the kind of here is how to succeed or any of those things.

1207
01:12:33,499 --> 01:12:42,088
Rym: Just vignettes of what it was like very directly to be us, the front row crew, in college at RIT.

1208
01:12:44,655 --> 01:12:46,632
Rym: If you don't want to do it, maybe I'll do it on my own.

1209
01:12:46,976 --> 01:12:47,885
Scott: I feel like I can do this.

1210
01:12:47,905 --> 01:12:57,885
Scott: -I feel like we've already communicated that pretty thoroughly and I don't have, you know, it's definitely something that is people want to hear and some, you know, but I feel like we've done it already.

1211
01:12:57,926 --> 01:13:00,592
Scott: It's like it's already been done and you're proposing doing it.

1212
01:13:00,612 --> 01:13:08,530
Rym: -No, because part of it is that yeah, it has been done but it's diffuse throughout hundreds and hundreds of episodes of GeekNights and this would be kind of a consolidation.

1213
01:13:08,830 --> 01:13:12,370
Scott: -So maybe the solution is to go back collect the material and edit it together.

1214
01:13:12,530 --> 01:13:21,218
Rym: -No, that's a terrible idea because usually all the material is told in the context of something else and also there's no way in hell I would have the time.

1215
01:13:21,238 --> 01:13:26,108
Scott: -No, no, I mean just like you know, take all the episodes and just say these are the episodes to listen to.

1216
01:13:26,169 --> 01:13:26,735
Scott: that have, you know.

1217
01:13:26,755 --> 01:13:28,010
Rym: -That's also a terrible idea.

1218
01:13:28,171 --> 01:13:37,259
Rym: A better idea would be to take all the vignettes and retell them in kind of some sort of narrative even if it's a loose narrative and have a separate show.

1219
01:13:37,622 --> 01:13:44,190
Rym: You've done the pre-work and the research by telling the anecdotes diffuse throughout all these shows and you consolidate them and make a separate show.

1220
01:13:44,230 --> 01:13:45,788
Rym: that is Life at RIT.

1221
01:13:47,350 --> 01:13:48,635
Scott: -Eh, maybe.

1222
01:13:48,918 --> 01:13:50,050
Scott: Doesn't excite me that much.

1223
01:13:50,070 --> 01:13:58,470
Rym: -It excites me a lot to the point that I'll probably, I'll probably do that and have it done long before I do any of the other things I've been promising I'll do for GeekNights.

1224
01:13:58,930 --> 01:14:02,170
Scott: -I'm working on websites and things slowly but surely.

1225
01:14:02,670 --> 01:14:03,741
Rym: -Anyway, let's eat some food and go to bed.

1226
01:14:03,762 --> 01:14:04,550
Scott: -Oh god food.

1227
01:14:10,940 --> 01:14:13,233
Rym: -This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1228
01:14:13,314 --> 01:14:15,740
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music.

1229
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:27,619
Scott: -Be sure to visit our website at www.frontroadcrew.com where you'll find show notes, links, our awesome forum, a link to our Frapper map, and links to all the RSS feeds.

1230
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:33,879
Rym: -We say feeds plural because GeekNights airs four nights a week covering four different brands of geekery.

1231
01:14:34,465 --> 01:14:36,000
Rym: Mondays are science and technology.

1232
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:38,789
Rym: Tuesdays we have video games, board games, and RPGs.

1233
01:14:39,153 --> 01:14:44,627
Rym: Wednesdays are anime, manga, comic nights, and Thursdays are the catch-alls for various rants and tomfoolery.

1234
01:14:44,648 --> 01:14:53,149
Scott: -You can send us feedback by email to geeknights at frontroadcrew.com or you can send audio feedback via Odeo.

1235
01:14:53,432 --> 01:14:56,727
Scott: Just click the link that says "send me an Odeo" on the right side of our website.

1236
01:14:56,747 --> 01:15:02,059
Rym: -If you like what you hear, you can catch the last 100 episodes in iTunes or in your favorite podcatcher.

1237
01:15:02,382 --> 01:15:05,440
Rym: For the complete archives, visit the website which has everything.

1240
01:15:19,432 --> 01:15:22,927
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1241
01:15:23,331 --> 01:15:26,229
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
