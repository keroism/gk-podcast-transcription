1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,231
Rym: It's Tuesday, December 1st, 2020.

2
00:00:10,231 --> 00:00:10,673
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,265 --> 00:00:13,575
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,125
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,145 --> 00:00:19,080
Rym: Tonight we are talking about 1817.

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,680
Rym: The 18xx game that doesn't have a colon and a long sentence explaining what the game is about.

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,380
Rym: The game from 2010.

8
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:28,357
Scott: Let's do this.

9
00:00:30,401 --> 00:00:39,093
Scott: So, uh, my original plan was that starting next Wednesday I would no longer work for the rest of the year.

10
00:00:39,294 --> 00:00:43,420
Scott: until January 4th of next year I would resume working again.

11
00:00:43,721 --> 00:00:44,718
Rym: Oh yeah, I remember that plan.

12
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:57,320
Scott: And this is because my company, while although they dropped hints that they might do something, had not announced any change to the number of vacation days that could be carried over to next year.

13
00:00:57,903 --> 00:01:01,279
Scott: And I already had carried over 10 to this year.

14
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,380
Rym: Oh, so you're already pushing the envelope.

15
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:08,452
Scott: And I could not travel anywhere, so I could not use those days for anything meaningful.

16
00:01:08,472 --> 00:01:11,540
Scott: was I going to use them to stay home, which I do every day anyway, right?

17
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:18,140
Scott: So, uh, I ended up, uh, being like, well, I'm going to lose these days if I don't use them.

18
00:01:18,522 --> 00:01:21,119
Scott: So I used all the days I could stacked up at the end of the year.

19
00:01:22,304 --> 00:01:26,939
Scott: Uh, and I took off the whole week of Thanksgiving because, whatever, that's nice anyway, right?

20
00:01:28,141 --> 00:01:30,789
Scott: Uh, and then I come back from the Thanksgiving to work.

21
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:34,400
Scott: yesterday, first day of work, and I see some announcement.

22
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,580
Scott: It's like, yeah, we're going to let you bring over all your days.

23
00:01:38,201 --> 00:01:38,362
Scott: All?

24
00:01:38,382 --> 00:01:39,428
Scott: All?

25
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:42,420
Rym: Motherfucker, I only get to put over 10.

26
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,500
Scott: So I couldn't bring over the 10 days from last year, right?

27
00:01:47,561 --> 00:01:48,177
Rym: I guess that's fair.

28
00:01:49,024 --> 00:01:51,840
Scott: Because, and I've already used those pretty much, right?

29
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:58,840
Rym: I mean, I did, weirdly, I used a lot of vacation days this year because MagFest and PAX East did happen.

30
00:01:59,463 --> 00:02:00,359
Scott: I did use those, yeah.

31
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:07,559
Scott: I'm still going to take off the, my work is just automatically closed from Christmas Eve through New Year's.

32
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:12,580
Scott: Uh, but I took off like this two and a half days before Christmas, right, that week.

33
00:02:12,943 --> 00:02:14,420
Scott: So I kept that off, right?

34
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:20,658
Scott: But I cancelled, I guess, you know, eight vacation days, which I will now carry over, right?

35
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,496
Scott: So, um, so that's basically carrying over 18 days.

36
00:02:26,781 --> 00:02:29,700
Scott: I guess I could have carried over 20, but I'm carrying over 18.

37
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,791
Scott: So next year I will have 38 vacation days.

38
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,939
Scott: Uh, and hopefully traveling will be legal next year and safe to do.

39
00:02:38,381 --> 00:02:42,579
Scott: In which case I will do some ridiculous traveling, uh, like I have never done before.

40
00:02:44,643 --> 00:02:48,560
Scott: Uh, with like a, you know, not just the conventions, but also who knows what else, right?

41
00:02:49,162 --> 00:02:50,780
Rym: Maybe bike a ridiculous distance.

42
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,520
Rym: Start with some like easy long weekends in like cities in Europe.

43
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,159
Scott: Yeah, I could do that.

44
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,140
Scott: I could see some castle.

45
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,919
Scott: I could bike very, very far.

46
00:02:59,462 --> 00:03:00,257
Scott: I kind of want to do that.

47
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,700
Rym: Yeah, I'm still planning a big long trip in Asia and like a long weekend in Paris.

48
00:03:05,063 --> 00:03:07,080
Rym: And, uh, I've got the, I've got the itch.

49
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:08,138
Rym: I'm finally going to do it.

50
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:20,556
Rym: Uh, if I can, this left away till like 2022, probably because even if the, even if it becomes safe to travel, it will, it will, the price of traveling will skyrocket.

51
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:20,997
Rym: everyone.

52
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,700
Rym: Literally everyone who can afford to is like, I'm just going to spend a weekend in Paris.

53
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,059
Scott: Exactly.

54
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,820
Scott: We destroy the earth with some more plane exhaust, right?

55
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:33,959
Scott: So that's why I was thinking, you know, do something like bike very far.

56
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:34,292
Scott: Yeah.

57
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,880
Rym: We're thinking about next summer biking to Rochester from New York city.

58
00:03:40,461 --> 00:03:41,099
Scott: Uh, you can do that.

59
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,660
Rym: Once you get up north, there's a path that's pretty long that goes west.

60
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:50,817
Rym: Yeah, but it's not, it's not, uh, Yeah, maybe on the road for good chunks of it until you get to the, but the Erie canal parts are really nice.

61
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:59,240
Scott: There was an empire state ride, which I think was like from New York city to Buffalo that I kind of wanted to do, but it's one of those ones you had to fundraise a pile of money.

62
00:04:00,511 --> 00:04:00,659
Rym: Yeah.

63
00:04:01,281 --> 00:04:02,357
Rym: Or you can buy your way in.

64
00:04:03,381 --> 00:04:03,595
Scott: Yeah.

65
00:04:03,962 --> 00:04:05,039
Scott: Like with a pile of money.

66
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,920
Rym: I mean, I remember I looked at that way back cause I was like, okay.

67
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:12,700
Rym: Uh, I don't really want to like have to volunteer a whole bunch to do the New York marathon in the future.

68
00:04:12,762 --> 00:04:13,219
Rym: Cause I'm busy.

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,640
Rym: So what would it take to just buy my way through the lottery?

70
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:17,779
Rym: And it is a lot of money.

71
00:04:18,187 --> 00:04:18,480
Rym: Good God.

72
00:04:18,762 --> 00:04:19,320
Rym: It is a lot of money.

73
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:25,439
Scott: There is, there is a famous ride called the rag brai, which is where you bike across the state of Iowa.

74
00:04:26,181 --> 00:04:30,360
Scott: And first of all, I don't really want to go to Iowa, but also, I haven't been to Iowa.

75
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,539
Rym: I think I've been to Iowa once.

76
00:04:31,681 --> 00:04:32,779
Scott: I have not been to Iowa.

77
00:04:34,643 --> 00:04:36,500
Scott: Um, I don't think I've been, look at my map.

78
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,660
Rym: I guess I've been to Iowa.

79
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,760
Scott: I guess I've been to Iowa.

80
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,660
Scott: If I've, if this plane to Seattle flew.

81
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:40,795
Rym: Nope.

82
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,860
Rym: I've never been to Iowa.

83
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,360
Rym: The closest I've been is Omaha, Nebraska.

84
00:04:46,144 --> 00:04:47,039
Rym: It's just not that close.

85
00:04:48,845 --> 00:04:51,180
Scott: Um, unless the plane went over it and that counts somehow.

86
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:52,000
Rym: Yeah.

87
00:04:52,101 --> 00:04:52,968
Rym: Literally the closest.

88
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:54,179
Rym: I hope I was right on the edge.

89
00:04:54,964 --> 00:04:56,480
Rym: I was almost in Iowa.

90
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:57,720
Rym: Actually.

91
00:04:58,723 --> 00:04:59,580
Rym: Might've been in Iowa.

92
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,620
Rym: I got to zoom in and say edging Iowa.

93
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:01,993
Rym: Nope.

94
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,520
Rym: My, I was, I was edging Iowa.

95
00:05:03,923 --> 00:05:05,677
Rym: I was, I never actually crossed over the border.

96
00:05:06,663 --> 00:05:08,195
Rym: I was in Nebraska the entire time.

97
00:05:09,463 --> 00:05:09,737
Scott: Okay.

98
00:05:11,021 --> 00:05:16,919
Scott: Well, you know, but that ride, uh, had some drama and I think split into two rides or something, or who knows?

99
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,700
Scott: There was some, uh, I don't know what the drama was.

100
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,360
Scott: I just know that there was drama and that one of the rides is good and one is bad.

101
00:05:24,301 --> 00:05:26,059
Scott: One of those forks to fork.

102
00:05:26,888 --> 00:05:28,020
Rym: One, two, three, four.

103
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,220
Rym: I was four miles away from being in Iowa.

104
00:05:31,902 --> 00:05:36,599
Scott: So yeah, I guess I'm going to be working, uh, this week, the week after that and the week after that.

105
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,997
Scott: And then no more work until January 4th.

106
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:49,560
Scott: So not really, not really that big a difference, but, uh, you know, the, I had some amount of planning of stuff I was going to do, uh, the rest of the year.

107
00:05:49,681 --> 00:05:52,340
Scott: And I guess that will be reduced somewhat significantly.

108
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:52,777
Scott: Right?

109
00:05:53,244 --> 00:05:53,353
Rym: Yep.

110
00:05:53,842 --> 00:05:58,720
Rym: Uh, the one thing is I pretty sure my business travel is going to pick up again, pretty hardcore after COVID.

111
00:05:59,181 --> 00:06:04,979
Rym: A lot of business globally has just been deferred for basically a year and let someone else pay for it.

112
00:06:05,101 --> 00:06:05,420
Scott: That's fine.

113
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:05,900
Rym: Yeah.

114
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:16,179
Rym: Well, the only reason I mentioned that is I'm excited about it because my worry is also your worry that everyone's going to try to travel and it's going to be really hard to travel next year for a while.

115
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:20,240
Rym: But business travel kind of doesn't worry about that.

116
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,739
Rym: Like they just send you no matter what.

117
00:06:22,283 --> 00:06:25,140
Scott: Well, that's, that's the thing is a business travel will not suffer.

118
00:06:25,221 --> 00:06:26,515
Scott: They'll just pay and make it.

119
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:36,900
Scott: And everyone who needs to fly for business will fly for business, but that will put pressure downwards on people flying for non-business making the prices higher.

120
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:41,639
Rym: Cause like very few people, like it's like, I don't fly business class unless someone who pays for it.

121
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,039
Rym: That shit is crazy expensive.

122
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:48,480
Scott: But I think it's also going to put pressure from bigger businesses on smaller businesses, right?

123
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,780
Scott: There are only so many first class seats and only so many flights.

124
00:06:52,281 --> 00:07:03,840
Scott: I think people who are used to flying first class or are, and will be flying for business will end up having to sit in coach, uh, or you know, one of those, a lower class of seats.

125
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,617
Rym: Oh, I think you're going to see a lot of that.

126
00:07:06,902 --> 00:07:18,640
Scott: I know your, your big, big, big company will take up all the first class seats and then the bigger, the biggie company kind of big, we'll take up all those premium, whatever premium economy.

127
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:28,826
Rym: That's the part that sucks because I will never buy business class like with my own money, because it's so ridiculous, but premium economy for a really long flight, that's like the sweet spot of.

128
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,520
Rym: it's expensive, but it's just about worth it.

129
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:38,419
Rym: If you get a deal as a person to pay for like flying to Australia, premium economy compared to coach, it's like night and day.

130
00:07:38,781 --> 00:07:46,799
Scott: It's going to be at the point where I think, you know, the seat next to the toilet that nobody wants is going to be as expensive as like premium economy used to be.

131
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,181
Rym: Yep.

132
00:07:47,282 --> 00:07:50,056
Rym: I think there's going to be very few cheap flights except two places.

133
00:07:50,076 --> 00:07:50,759
Rym: no one wants to go.

134
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,699
Scott: As soon as passports start working again and places let you in.

135
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,197
Rym: You know what the secret is going to be?

136
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:01,720
Rym: Go to places that are not popular or common tourist destinations, but that would be interesting to you.

137
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,620
Scott: I think another, that's a good strategy.

138
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:08,580
Scott: Another good strategy is to use a different method of transportation.

139
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:13,178
Rym: Fly somewhere weird and then like take trains or bicycles around, do a trip.

140
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,440
Scott: Or just don't use a plane in the first place.

141
00:08:15,521 --> 00:08:16,197
Scott: Just use like a boat.

142
00:08:17,723 --> 00:08:18,269
Rym: Not a cruise.

143
00:08:18,512 --> 00:08:19,180
Rym: Don't do cruises.

144
00:08:19,962 --> 00:08:20,969
Scott: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

145
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:22,299
Scott: Not a cruise.

146
00:08:22,862 --> 00:08:24,394
Rym: I would do Amtrak across America.

147
00:08:24,434 --> 00:08:24,918
Rym: That could be fun.

148
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,555
Scott: Yeah, you know, any kind of alternative thing.

149
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,780
Rym: You know, my biggest regret in my entire like working life was way back.

150
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:36,919
Rym: I did this really, really long, I did like this three week business trip all over Europe for like just a bunch of stuff.

151
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:44,480
Rym: Like I put, I took all my business travel I normally do over the course of like a quarter and I got my company to agree to let me just do it all in one long trip.

152
00:08:45,643 --> 00:08:48,400
Scott: But then again, also, right, not just like the downward pressure.

153
00:08:48,480 --> 00:09:00,700
Rym: But the point was I had the opportunity, instead of flying from Germany to Istanbul and making some stops along the way, I thought about taking the like the literal Orient Express.

154
00:09:01,701 --> 00:09:02,316
Scott: Yeah, you could do that.

155
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,760
Rym: But it ended up being too expensive and way too far out of the way.

156
00:09:06,682 --> 00:09:11,060
Scott: But just like this downward pressure going to be on the cheaper, you know, plane seats.

157
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:22,900
Scott: That's, you know, the whole industry is going to have, you know, price pressure in terms of like, oh, OK, well, you can't go to Disney World because everyone who's already going there, it's full now because we can finally go there safely.

158
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,920
Scott: Disney World is full.

159
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:30,080
Rym: Dude, Cedar Point is already selling season tickets for post COVID times and they're already selling out.

160
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:30,960
Rym: People are making reservations.

161
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,397
Scott: Six Flags is going to be full too.

162
00:09:32,621 --> 00:09:32,747
Scott: Yep.

163
00:09:34,904 --> 00:09:36,460
Rym: Got to go off the beaten path a little bit.

164
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:41,700
Scott: I feel like you got to have to go off a lot because the other people are going to be pushed off the beaten path as well.

165
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:48,760
Rym: I feel like the PAX's that haven't sold out for a while are going to sell out so hard when they can happen.

166
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:49,280
Scott: Could be.

167
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:49,890
Scott: Could be.

168
00:09:50,721 --> 00:09:55,104
Rym: I think it's going to be trouble to get hotels for PAX East 2022.

169
00:09:55,104 --> 00:09:55,780
Scott: I mean, probably.

170
00:09:56,661 --> 00:09:59,360
Rym: I mean, it's already trouble in non-COVID times to get hotels for that kind.

171
00:09:59,602 --> 00:10:01,240
Rym: All right.

172
00:10:01,926 --> 00:10:02,799
Rym: So gaming news.

173
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,988
Rym: This is such a small thing, but it's such a big deal because it's like.

174
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:15,200
Rym: this is an example of a user experience improvement that is just great for everyone and obvious in retrospect.

175
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,839
Rym: And I can't I don't know why I'm surprised that Nintendo did something like this.

176
00:10:20,361 --> 00:10:20,943
Scott: Well, no, I'm.

177
00:10:21,505 --> 00:10:24,475
Scott: basically the news is one of those things where it's.

178
00:10:24,656 --> 00:10:25,840
Scott: it's almost like a bad news.

179
00:10:25,941 --> 00:10:28,040
Scott: It's not, yay, you finally did this.

180
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:28,618
Scott: It's boo.

181
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:31,920
Scott: Why were you so stupid that you didn't do this until now?

182
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:32,478
Scott: You suck.

183
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,019
Scott: Well, that it took you this long.

184
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:34,638
Rym: I'm annoyed.

185
00:10:35,141 --> 00:10:39,940
Rym: One, my Switch should just be able to like send files to arbitrary places like I should be there.

186
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,720
Rym: I should be able to tweet directly from the Switch.

187
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:48,580
Rym: I should be able to just like, yeah, hit a button and have the pictures appear in like my Nintendo account to download.

188
00:10:50,261 --> 00:10:57,860
Scott: But, yeah, so the way the Nintendo Switch has on it a physical button on the left controller to take screenshots and video.

189
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,979
Scott: It's a built in feature so much that has its own goddamn button.

190
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:15,920
Scott: But until until just like yesterday, the only way to get those screenshots and videos off of the Switch and onto the Internet where you would share them is the Switch itself had some automatic sharing functionalities.

191
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,340
Scott: You could connect your Switch to, say, Twitter to automatically tweet your photos and videos straight from the Switch.

192
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,800
Scott: You usually don't want to do that.

193
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:28,860
Scott: You want to edit it or do something else to it first or, you know, share it on a service that's not supported by the Switch.

194
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:33,080
Rym: And also there it was not configurable enough or usable enough.

195
00:11:34,392 --> 00:11:34,560
Scott: Yeah.

196
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:40,800
Scott: And then the other thing you could do is, you know, the Switch does have an SD card hidden under the little like T-Stand thing.

197
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:41,252
Scott: Right.

198
00:11:42,081 --> 00:11:54,960
Scott: You could take the SD card out, put it in your computer or an SD card reader and read the read the the images off of it as if the Switch was a camera and it was just photos that the Switch took.

199
00:11:56,552 --> 00:11:57,220
Scott: So that works.

200
00:11:57,321 --> 00:12:00,180
Scott: But it's a hassle because a micro SD hiding under the Switch.

201
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:04,760
Scott: You got to take a switch out of the dock, go to the computer, drag and drop, put it back in the Switch.

202
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:05,922
Scott: It's not.

203
00:12:06,003 --> 00:12:08,159
Scott: it's not a good experience to do it that way.

204
00:12:08,941 --> 00:12:17,620
Scott: I mean, even when I have a camera where the SD card is much more accessible, I will frequently just plug the camera in with the USB cable because it's easier to take the cards out.

205
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:26,690
Scott: So what they did is they made a firmware update to the Switch to do something that should have been there on day one, which is a you can't.

206
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:31,616
Scott: there's a complicated garbage procedure where you can get photos off of the Switch by taking.

207
00:12:31,636 --> 00:12:34,280
Scott: it'll display a QR code on the Switch.

208
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:40,460
Scott: You take a photo of that with your camera and then that'll help you get the photos from the Switch to your phone.

209
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:47,620
Scott: And two, the smart thing, you can now just plug your Switch in with USB cable to your computer and get the photos off.

210
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,378
Rym: Oh, I didn't notice that part.

211
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:50,140
Scott: That's just obvious.

212
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,519
Scott: It's like that's what should have been there.

213
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,180
Scott: It's like why did this take so long?

214
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,700
Rym: That's so much better because it's so fiddly to get that stupid SD card out.

215
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:56,480
Scott: Right.

216
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,460
Scott: It's like you just plug your Switch into your computer with the cable.

217
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:58,791
Scott: Boom.

218
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,440
Scott: Download the files right off there.

219
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:00,700
Scott: Done.

220
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,084
Scott: It took.

221
00:13:02,205 --> 00:13:03,440
Scott: how long has the Switch been around?

222
00:13:03,502 --> 00:13:04,220
Scott: Two or three years?

223
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,080
Rym: That's what I was getting at.

224
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:11,520
Rym: This is such a good UX improvement, but it only was an improvement because Nintendo Nintendo'd for so long.

225
00:13:12,142 --> 00:13:12,320
Scott: Right.

226
00:13:13,241 --> 00:13:16,480
Scott: They're trash for how many years with this awful functionality.

227
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:22,240
Rym: But at least we're at a saturation point where pretty much anyone who has a Switch has a smartphone.

228
00:13:24,064 --> 00:13:25,120
Rym: Like even kids have smartphones.

229
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,560
Rym: So I think it seems like it just works.

230
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:33,420
Scott: I mean, that's why they, you know, I mean Switch still has the stupid thing where if you want to do voice chat in a Switch game, you have to open up the separate app to do it.

231
00:13:34,603 --> 00:13:36,539
Scott: It does work, but you know.

232
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,040
Rym: Yep.

233
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,900
Rym: I've never tried it and I doubt I ever will.

234
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,479
Scott: I've used it one time.

235
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:47,240
Scott: It worked nicely, but it's still, you know, it's like you're going to be on your phone while you're playing your Switch.

236
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:56,700
Rym: So in some other news, Super Mario Maker is not going to let you upload levels anymore in 2021.

237
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:56,769
Scott: Yep.

238
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,620
Scott: So this is, I just wanted to bring this up.

239
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,940
Scott: You know, it's sort of obvious, right?

240
00:14:00,141 --> 00:14:02,757
Scott: The Wii shop died a while ago, right?

241
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,899
Scott: I'm sure the 3DS shop is probably coming soon.

242
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,420
Scott: It's going to die at some point.

243
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,077
Scott: Get ready.

244
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:20,540
Scott: And at the Wii U, which no one bought Wii U's, the sales, go look at the sales numbers of Wii U versus Switch and it'll really put things in perspective for you how awful the Wii U sold and how almost no one has one.

245
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:28,720
Scott: But they're going to shut down the online Mario Maker features for the Wii U original Mario Maker, not Mario Maker 2. that's on your Switch.

246
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,839
Scott: That's still going strong.

247
00:14:30,361 --> 00:14:38,276
Scott: But one day, yeah, the Switch ones are going to shut down too in like 2030 or some, you know, close, probably not even 2030, maybe 2027, 28, something like that, right?

248
00:14:40,923 --> 00:14:42,300
Scott: At the rate, the pace we're going.

249
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:51,000
Scott: And this is why if a game is available on PC and you have a PC, which you should have, you should get it on PC.

250
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:56,860
Rym: Unless you are willing to just accept the fact that that game will one day disappear and you'll never be able to play it again.

251
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:57,915
Scott: Yep.

252
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,099
Rym: Your save game will be gone.

253
00:15:00,061 --> 00:15:00,361
Scott: Yep.

254
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:01,464
Scott: PC stuff, yeah.

255
00:15:01,504 --> 00:15:07,640
Scott: Sometimes online services for MMOs and stuff go down, but, you know, people find a way on PC.

256
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:11,100
Scott: If it's an EXE, people can somehow find a way.

257
00:15:11,581 --> 00:15:19,820
Rym: There's an EXE file where you can make Tribes 2 work and there's another EXE file that basically fakes all the servers necessary to make Tribes 2 work.

258
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:25,340
Rym: And I just found that website, not only is it still up, but someone posted there as recently as last May.

259
00:15:26,281 --> 00:15:26,441
Scott: Yep.

260
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:33,080
Scott: So, yeah, Mario Maker is pretty much like it's, you know, as soon as that server goes down, it's like, that's it.

261
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:39,920
Scott: There's like all those Mario Maker 1 levels are just going to be like lost to the archives of Nintendo.

262
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,318
Rym: Like tears in the rain.

263
00:15:42,561 --> 00:15:46,280
Scott: Well, I think they're going to remove, I think, just the functionality to upload new levels.

264
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,080
Rym: Yeah, but how are you going to download them and play them?

265
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,141
Scott: Right.

266
00:15:50,201 --> 00:15:54,740
Scott: But yeah, the downloading functionality is, I guess, still going to be there for now, I think.

267
00:15:54,981 --> 00:15:59,180
Rym: Well, Super Mario Maker itself will disappear from the eShop entirely in January.

268
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:00,340
Scott: Yep.

269
00:16:00,862 --> 00:16:02,908
Scott: And so it's like, if you can't download more, like.

270
00:16:02,948 --> 00:16:06,780
Scott: the whole thing is just like, it's like, wow, people put all that work into all those levels.

271
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,179
Scott: And there's like, there's such a, you know, huge amount of content there.

272
00:16:10,661 --> 00:16:14,760
Scott: And even if Nintendo keeps backups somewhere, it's like, wow, that'll just be lost.

273
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:15,121
Rym: Yep.

274
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:17,009
Rym: I've seen things you people wouldn't believe.

275
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:19,540
Rym: Bullet bills off the shoulder of Bowser's castle.

276
00:16:20,701 --> 00:16:20,962
Scott: Right.

277
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:26,020
Scott: But it's like, you know, not all those levels are meaningful, but there's a lot of work that went into a lot of levels.

278
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,940
Scott: And if you don't have them like saved to your Wii U in advance, like those will be the only levels that you'll be able to play.

279
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,899
Scott: You won't be able to get any more than anyone else has worked on.

280
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:35,806
Rym: Yeah.

281
00:16:35,826 --> 00:16:36,818
Rym: But also, unlike say...

282
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:43,160
Scott: The Mario Maker 2, the Mario Maker 2 database of levels is even bigger, even more enormous, right?

283
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,760
Scott: So many more copies sold, I presume, because the Switch sold better.

284
00:16:47,564 --> 00:16:50,337
Scott: When those are lost, that'll be a real damn shame, right?

285
00:16:50,457 --> 00:16:50,920
Scott: You know, so...

286
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:58,560
Rym: But even worse, if someone tries to hack something together to make it work, Nintendo is not known for letting fans do anything.

287
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,380
Rym: Like, Nintendo shut down that Smash tournament a little while ago.

288
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:17,398
Scott: And even if you did get, even if you were able to make a perfect Mario Maker server and use DNS to trick your Wii U into connecting to that instead, and it worked 100% identically to the original one, you know, that was perfect in every way, you don't have all those levels that got made.

289
00:17:17,681 --> 00:17:21,180
Rym: Unless you're hacking this now and you're downloading all these levels somehow.

290
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,680
Scott: You would have to hack into Nintendo's server and steal all the levels.

291
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:31,420
Scott: Even if you have a legal copy of the game, you can only download so many levels via their APIs or whatever.

292
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:31,961
Rym: Yep.

293
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:34,460
Rym: And everyone likes to throttle APIs lately.

294
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,957
Rym: But anyway, things of the day!

295
00:17:42,977 --> 00:17:43,359
Rym: What do you got?

296
00:17:44,721 --> 00:17:49,760
Scott: Alright, so, you know, just a talented jazz musician, right?

297
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,480
Scott: This woman from Sweden named Gunhild Carling, right?

298
00:17:56,001 --> 00:17:58,499
Scott: You know, a jazz musician, among other things.

299
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,704
Scott: Vintage music and fashion.

300
00:18:00,725 --> 00:18:04,539
Scott: If you go to their website, gunhildcarling.net, they got a whole bunch of content posted.

301
00:18:05,421 --> 00:18:08,740
Scott: This is like 159 pages of content, and they're updating frequently.

302
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:11,275
Scott: It's like, the latest post is November 27th of this year.

303
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,460
Scott: You know, some live performance on a YouTube channel, right?

304
00:18:16,581 --> 00:18:24,500
Scott: But, on Twitter, a video of Gunhild Carling went around and was much retweeted, with good reason.

305
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:48,080
Scott: But my thing of the day is, the original YouTube video that Twitter was taken from, because the Twitter video is only a minute something long, the full video is three minutes something long, here's a performance, I think for 2014, in Central Park, by Gunhild, playing some hot swing jazz music on a bagpipe.

306
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:51,259
Scott: And that is not something I've seen before in my entire life.

307
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:55,320
Scott: That's why it got so many retweets, and that's why you should check it out.

308
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,060
Scott: I've only ever heard bagpipe music from a bagpipe.

309
00:18:59,581 --> 00:19:01,000
Rym: That is pretty cool.

310
00:19:01,962 --> 00:19:06,659
Scott: I want to hear, you know, I bet there's metal bagpipes, if I search for them, they're going to be there, right?

311
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:11,620
Rym: I mean, the drone feels like a drone would fit right in with some background.

312
00:19:11,761 --> 00:19:15,640
Scott: There's a 1000% chance there was already metal bagpipe music, right?

313
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,460
Scott: I would never bet against that, not even one penny.

314
00:19:20,363 --> 00:19:22,140
Rym: The next step is we need bagpipe wave.

315
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:30,795
Scott: Yeah, but I imagine there are some genres of music the bagpipe has not hit on with yet, but jazz is not one of them.

316
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:45,880
Rym: So, my thing of the day is a very simple website, and it covers the entirety of the United States of America and Canada, and also much of the UK and almost all of Germany.

317
00:19:46,661 --> 00:19:48,959
Rym: This website will do one thing.

318
00:19:49,441 --> 00:19:58,480
Rym: You can look at any McDonald's in any of those places, anywhere, and know, right now, in real time, if their ice cream maker is broken or not.

319
00:19:59,521 --> 00:20:01,011
Scott: Well, how are they getting this information?

320
00:20:01,071 --> 00:20:02,420
Scott: It's supposed to be crowdsourced, right?

321
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:04,300
Rym: So, that is the coolest thing.

322
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,620
Scott: You go into a McDonald's, you try to order ice cream, it's not working, you report it to this website.

323
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:23,740
Rym: So, this website, the way it works is, Rashik, the individual who made it, reverse engineered a McDonald's internal API, and then set up an app that makes an order.

324
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:37,960
Rym: It spends, well, it attempts to spend $18,752 every minute by buying one small ice cream cone at every McDonald's on earth to see if it'll let you put it in the cart.

325
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:45,439
Rym: And if it doesn't let you put it in the cart, then it knows that the machine is broken, and then it decides not to.

326
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,338
Scott: Or they don't have one.

327
00:20:47,563 --> 00:20:56,820
Rym: He talks a little more about how they actually do it, but basically, you can infer whether or not the ice cream machine is working from the way the cart works.

328
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,131
Scott: What if a new McDonald's opens up?

329
00:20:59,171 --> 00:21:00,220
Scott: Does it, like, update his shit?

330
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:00,632
Rym: Yes.

331
00:21:01,784 --> 00:21:01,891
Scott: Okay.

332
00:21:03,441 --> 00:21:15,798
Rym: So, he goes and tries to buy one ice cream from every McDonald's in America, and then closes that out of his cart instead of buying it every minute of every hour of every day to make this website work.

333
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,960
Scott: And McDonald's doesn't notice or care?

334
00:21:18,947 --> 00:21:19,579
Rym: I guess not.

335
00:21:21,262 --> 00:21:25,057
Rym: I mean, I guess they could try to block his IP from buying things from McDonald's.

336
00:21:26,129 --> 00:21:26,300
Scott: Sure.

337
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,160
Rym: But they seem to have not caught on, or if they've caught on, they don't care.

338
00:21:30,942 --> 00:21:32,460
Rym: And this website just works.

339
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:37,600
Rym: And I'm zooming in right now, and I can see that there's almost no McDonald's anywhere near me, thankfully.

340
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,405
Scott: Yeah, there is.

341
00:21:38,446 --> 00:21:39,215
Scott: There's one on 21st Street.

342
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:41,079
Rym: That's a bit of a ways away.

343
00:21:42,641 --> 00:21:44,051
Scott: There's one on the train, on Broadway.

344
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:45,823
Rym: Yep, I see it.

345
00:21:45,884 --> 00:21:46,850
Rym: Broadway at 31st.

346
00:21:46,911 --> 00:21:47,434
Rym: I see that one.

347
00:21:47,454 --> 00:21:48,320
Rym: The ice cream machine there.

348
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:48,863
Scott: Yeah, there's that one.

349
00:21:48,883 --> 00:21:51,600
Scott: Because I always look out the train window and you can see the play place in there.

350
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,084
Rym: They checked it.

351
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:53,700
Rym: The ice cream machine there is currently working.

352
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:54,815
Scott: Okay.

353
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:59,836
Rym: Oh, but the one across the Queensborough Ridge, and then down at 50th Street?

354
00:22:00,177 --> 00:22:01,019
Rym: No ice cream right now.

355
00:22:02,107 --> 00:22:02,320
Scott: Uh-oh.

356
00:22:05,521 --> 00:22:09,620
Rym: So, in about a moment, I did not get the Hanzo signal.

357
00:22:10,686 --> 00:22:11,478
Scott: And neither did I.

358
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,458
Rym: So, we're not reading the Tale of the Engi yet.

359
00:22:14,482 --> 00:22:16,600
Scott: I am reading some Adventure Time comics, I guess.

360
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:21,380
Rym: Yep, I'm reading some non-fiction about elections and political machines.

361
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:22,818
Scott: It's a little late for that.

362
00:22:23,602 --> 00:22:25,591
Rym: Not yet, because the Georgia Senate runoff is happening.

363
00:22:28,542 --> 00:22:29,954
Scott: I'm sure that book will help turn the tide.

364
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:30,900
Scott: But

365
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:46,860
Rym: what the book is about, I'll talk about it later, but the book's interesting because it's basically a current modern poli-sci take on the difference between people who follow politics and are very well informed about it, versus the people who follow politics are very well informed about it and do something other than just sending money.

366
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:53,320
Rym: Like, how do you get directly involved and actually make a difference in the current political machines?

367
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:54,904
Rym: Not counting.

368
00:22:54,944 --> 00:22:57,760
Rym: The problem is, you know what it doesn't cover, kind of specifically?

369
00:22:58,781 --> 00:23:03,360
Rym: New York politics, because New York politics is a completely different world from, like, most other American politics.

370
00:23:03,641 --> 00:23:06,617
Rym: And none of the things that apply anywhere else actually matter here.

371
00:23:09,161 --> 00:23:10,827
Rym: Like, I talk about the political machine.

372
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:14,500
Rym: New York politics is more like a modern Tammany Hall.

373
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:23,920
Rym: Like, there is a political machine, and you have to spend your entire life getting, like, sucked into that machine, and then one day, when you're old, they'll let you pull one of the levers.

374
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:25,600
Scott: I'm aware.

375
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:31,540
Rym: So, this won't apply to us getting involved in, like, Queens politics, but it might apply to, like, the rest of the country.

376
00:23:32,381 --> 00:23:33,266
Rym: It's interesting stuff.

377
00:23:33,426 --> 00:23:36,200
Rym: It's stuff I don't know a lot about, like that level of politics.

378
00:23:37,861 --> 00:23:39,495
Rym: But I'm not reading the Tale of Genji.

379
00:23:39,556 --> 00:23:40,000
Rym: as a result.

380
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,745
Rym: We got no-cons coming up.

381
00:23:41,945 --> 00:23:44,898
Rym: There's talk of the online magfest.

382
00:23:44,998 --> 00:23:45,400
Rym: Stay tuned.

383
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,919
Rym: We will be involved in that in as many capacities as we can.

384
00:23:49,381 --> 00:23:50,170
Rym: They have our sword.

385
00:23:50,211 --> 00:23:50,940
Rym: We'll see how it goes.

386
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,540
Rym: And otherwise, we're just trying to make stuff.

387
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,788
Rym: Follow our YouTube channels.

388
00:23:54,888 --> 00:23:55,694
Rym: Scott's making stuff.

389
00:23:55,755 --> 00:23:56,359
Rym: I'm making stuff.

390
00:23:58,381 --> 00:24:03,640
Rym: I had an idea on how to make the Utena show quicker, and I rewatched the next episode.

391
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,250
Rym: Do you know what the next episode is?

392
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,780
Rym: A full-on Black Rose duel.

393
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:07,912
Scott: It's a Black Rose episode.

394
00:24:07,953 --> 00:24:08,480
Scott: I know that much.

395
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,840
Rym: It's the jury duel in Black Rose.

396
00:24:11,866 --> 00:24:12,058
Scott: Okay.

397
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,760
Rym: 'Cause the episode we last did was an Anami episode.

398
00:24:17,241 --> 00:24:19,659
Scott: I forget if she fights the dude or the girl.

399
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:23,050
Rym: This is the--no, the dude's not in yet.

400
00:24:23,091 --> 00:24:24,580
Rym: The dude is in the final arc with the Kars.

401
00:24:25,781 --> 00:24:27,046
Rym: Ruka does not come back.

402
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:30,519
Rym: This is phase two of the jury story arc.

403
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:33,907
Rym: But I watched the episode again.

404
00:24:33,968 --> 00:24:35,380
Rym: It was real good, and I took some notes.

405
00:24:35,881 --> 00:24:44,098
Rym: And maybe we'll talk later about how we will do a show about it, maybe without having to do the full production that we do for a panel, 'cause that's a pain in the ass.

406
00:24:45,785 --> 00:24:46,336
Rym: We'll figure it out.

407
00:24:47,902 --> 00:24:49,859
Rym: That's all I really got, meta-moment-wise.

408
00:24:51,161 --> 00:24:52,533
Scott: Yeah, come find us on the internet.

409
00:24:52,553 --> 00:24:53,280
Scott: We're around.

410
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:56,257
Scott: We got forums, we got discords, we got all kinds of stuff.

411
00:24:56,297 --> 00:24:56,760
Scott: Talk to us.

412
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:57,181
Rym: Yep.

413
00:24:57,702 --> 00:25:02,860
Rym: So, we've done several shows on 18XX Games, and we stopped doing shows.

414
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,309
Rym: We've played more of them.

415
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:09,440
Rym: We haven't reviewed them all, because we don't want to turn gig nights into just the 18XX Games podcast.

416
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:13,580
Scott: Yeah, there seems to be a lot of things that we like that have serieses, right?

417
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:22,281
Scott: And, you know, you could make an entire podcast about, say-- I mean, recently we were talking about Jackbox Games, 'cause a new one just came out, Jackbox 7.

418
00:25:22,281 --> 00:25:25,540
Rym: And there's, like, game design stuff to say about every Jackbox that came out.

419
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,440
Scott: Yeah, but it's like, they come out with a Jackbox every October.

420
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:38,618
Scott: That's one--if we were to do a Jackbox episode every year about the new one that just came out, that's one--we only do a Tuesday show every other week, there's 52 weeks in a year.

421
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:46,595
Scott: That would be one 26th--every 26th Tuesday GeekNights gaming episode would be about Jackbox, leaving only 25 for other things.

422
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,780
Scott: Like, we can't just keep doing every episode about the same damn thing.

423
00:25:51,001 --> 00:25:57,550
Rym: The problem is, COVID means we're playing games that are easy to play during COVID, and what's very easy to play?

424
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:58,115
Rym: 18XX Games.

425
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:04,980
Scott: Right, so, you know, we already did two or three shows on 18XX Games.

426
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:08,160
Scott: What would possibly justify us doing yet another one?

427
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,220
Scott: Hopefully the last one, unless a really revolutionary one comes out sometime.

428
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:28,740
Scott: But 1817, the one we were talking about today, is dramatically different from the other 18XX Games, in that the way the stock market works is basically more fully featured.

429
00:26:29,702 --> 00:26:32,200
Scott: It's not just buy and sell, the end.

430
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:43,780
Scott: It's buy, sell, short, merge, acquisition, friendly acquisition, loans, interest, paying off loans, hostile takeovers, liquidations.

431
00:26:44,342 --> 00:26:51,420
Rym: And it materially changed my relationship with 18XX Games, and we'll review the whole game.

432
00:26:52,263 --> 00:27:08,799
Scott: I knew about this one in the past, because A, it's the New York one, because it's called 1817 because 1817 is the year the New York Stock Exchange formed, as opposed to the year being related to trains or anything like that.

433
00:27:10,245 --> 00:27:16,160
Scott: So the game, it's actually a lot less focused on the train action, and much more focused on the stock action.

434
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,920
Scott: The train action, it's like those unlimited tiles.

435
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:31,560
Rym: The train action changes the values of tokens and things for acquisition, but it also is just information that you use in the course of deciding how to invest and manage the company.

436
00:27:32,842 --> 00:27:33,820
Rym: It's like context for that.

437
00:27:34,284 --> 00:27:35,600
Scott: It's all about stocks and stuff.

438
00:27:35,902 --> 00:27:39,051
Scott: I knew that it had short selling, which the other ones didn't have, and I was like,

439
00:27:39,112 --> 00:27:39,418
Scott: "Ooh.".

440
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:46,900
Scott: But when you think about it, the huge list of things you can do, it's like, man, 18XX is already scary to some people.

441
00:27:47,241 --> 00:27:49,400
Scott: This one's got to be extra scary to some people.

442
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,380
Rym: It would be to a point.

443
00:27:51,183 --> 00:27:53,640
Rym: This is not your first 18XX game.

444
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:56,640
Rym: You will not enjoy it if you've never played one of these games before.

445
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:02,560
Scott: Well, you might if you are the kind of person who can play a complicated game.

446
00:28:04,782 --> 00:28:16,140
Rym: The trouble you have is that it's very difficult to learn this game if you don't have the context of 18XX games, because for us, all we had to look at were what's different.

447
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,700
Rym: And that really increased our enjoyment.

448
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,539
Rym: We can engage with it with fewer plays.

449
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,320
Rym: We had to play it one and a half times to review it.

450
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:27,720
Scott: Playing it on the computer matters more than anything.

451
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,179
Scott: I'm looking at a photo on BoardGame.

452
00:28:29,963 --> 00:28:32,260
Rym: I don't think I would ever want to play this one physically.

453
00:28:32,541 --> 00:28:37,580
Scott: Of people playing this in person with chips and boards all over the place.

454
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,319
Rym: It's an eclipse on the table.

455
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,079
Scott: It's even worse.

456
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,280
Scott: It's like a disaster.

457
00:28:43,843 --> 00:28:46,520
Scott: People say it takes six, seven hours to play this.

458
00:28:47,161 --> 00:28:53,120
Scott: I believe you, if you're playing this in person, there are some things that might actually go faster than playing it online.

459
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,359
Rym: Like mergers and acquisitions.

460
00:28:54,821 --> 00:28:55,419
Scott: Is anyone merging?

461
00:28:55,582 --> 00:28:56,480
Scott: Okay, no, whatever.

462
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,439
Scott: You can just skip that.

463
00:28:58,181 --> 00:29:00,560
Scott: And online, you have to wait for everyone to click the pass button.

464
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:04,940
Rym: But alright, now there's 12 train companies because people IPO'd like crazy.

465
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:09,580
Scott: The busy work involved in playing this game in person is just enormous.

466
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:19,400
Scott: The rule book is actually hard to read because I'm playing it online, but a lot of the stuff in the rule book actually describes what to do with the physical pieces in the game.

467
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,199
Scott: And I don't need that.

468
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,400
Scott: All I need to know is how the system works of the game.

469
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,840
Scott: I don't need to know the physical pieces because I'm playing online.

470
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:33,080
Rym: But the design is elegant in that the physical system, like the physical pieces do completely encapsulate the system.

471
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,240
Rym: And if you have those physical components, it does offload that from your brain elegantly.

472
00:29:37,341 --> 00:29:40,820
Rym: But if you don't have those physical components, nothing explains the mechanic.

473
00:29:41,927 --> 00:29:42,560
Scott: Yep, exactly.

474
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:54,680
Scott: So, but yeah, so what is the thing is as scary as it is, right, without all the short selling, merging, buying, liquidating, all that stuff, you know, you think it's complicated.

475
00:29:55,303 --> 00:29:58,800
Scott: But it took me one game to sort of figure it out.

476
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:04,200
Scott: Reading the rules, I read them over several times and I didn't really grasp it until we played once.

477
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,258
Scott: Now I fully grasp it.

478
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:05,711
Scott: Yep.

479
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:06,967
Scott: At least 90% plus grasp.

480
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:18,500
Rym: Part of the way I grasped it was because I could do things like click merger, look at what happened, and decide, oh, that's a terrible idea, and hit undo.

481
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,560
Scott: That's exactly what I did in the first game.

482
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,780
Scott: To do that with physical components.

483
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,819
Scott: I was merging, undoing, converting, undoing.

484
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:27,400
Rym: That would literally be, all right, everyone, go take a break.

485
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:34,320
Rym: Rym's going to calculate the valuation of his company for the next 10 minutes and decide which of these three paths to follow.

486
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:38,680
Scott: But playing online asynchronously, no one's got to wait, so it's pretty awesome.

487
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:52,940
Rym: But the TLDR of the why we're talking about this game is that these changes together, which we'll get into in detail, like why and how, they give agency to the players over the parts of the game that rankle us the most.

488
00:30:53,322 --> 00:31:11,360
Rym: In all the other 18xx games, even though they're simpler, they have this fundamental problem that there will be one part of the game, usually player order, but sometimes it's something slightly different, where you have almost no control over that order, yet that order determines whether or not you even have agency at key points in the game.

489
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:38,160
Rym: In this game, there are many ways to manipulate that player order, more ways than in the other games, so as a result, you have more opportunities to do the crazy things that often only happen once or twice in the other 18xx games, to the point to where in 1846, if I have the opportunity to rust a train onto someone, I'm fucking doing it, because how rare is it that I have that opportunity?

490
00:31:39,341 --> 00:31:42,800
Rym: But in this game, I have the opportunity to do crazy stuff every round.

491
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:45,559
Rym: The question is, do I want to do the crazy thing?

492
00:31:46,801 --> 00:31:50,500
Rym: That alone makes this game my favorite 18xx game already.

493
00:31:51,962 --> 00:32:00,712
Rym: And the listener in the stream already, when we said, "Oh, we're talking about 18x, 1817," Guy DotA immediately said, "1817 is the best 18xx.

494
00:32:01,014 --> 00:32:02,379
Rym: All I do is eat, sleep, and think about

495
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:05,321
Rym: 1817.".

496
00:32:05,321 --> 00:32:10,460
Scott: I mean, even though I've only played it once in a part time so far...

497
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,799
Rym: Yeah, we're in the middle of another second game of it right now.

498
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:13,601
Scott: Right.

499
00:32:14,105 --> 00:32:15,071
Scott: It is very great.

500
00:32:15,152 --> 00:32:21,559
Scott: I don't know if it's... I can't say it's too soon for me to say it's the best, but I can see how you could say it's the best.

501
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:22,520
Rym: It's my favorite.

502
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,500
Scott: It has the potential to be the best.

503
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:33,879
Rym: I saw complex strategies that I think I could execute that I did not need to execute, because all of us playing are at about the same level of befuddlement, in terms of how to be good at this game.

504
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:46,277
Rym: But I had a great time with it, and at no point did I feel... Every time there was a problem, like in the other 18xx games, very commonly, Mira Scott will say something like, "Well, I had no control over that, and now I'm

505
00:32:46,317 --> 00:32:46,599
Rym: boned.".

506
00:32:46,861 --> 00:32:50,680
Rym: And it's still fun, but I recognize the point after which I had no more agency.

507
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:56,760
Rym: In this game, agency lasted for a long time for most of the players.

508
00:32:57,861 --> 00:32:59,988
Scott: Yup.

509
00:33:00,008 --> 00:33:01,172
Scott: That's always my number.

510
00:33:01,253 --> 00:33:02,537
Scott: one thing that makes me mad.

511
00:33:02,597 --> 00:33:19,030
Scott: at any game, is if there is a time at which any player, especially me, but any player, is not eliminated from the game, cannot win, but even worse than cannot win, is cannot do anything, take any more meaningful actions.

512
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:19,680
Scott: Yup.

513
00:33:21,608 --> 00:33:22,780
Scott: That you can't even king make.

514
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,900
Scott: It's like you have no power in the game whatsoever.

515
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:28,000
Scott: You can't buy a stock, you can't sell one, you can't buy a train.

516
00:33:28,902 --> 00:33:33,800
Scott: Nothing is in your control, you have no decisions left, but you are still here, and you are technically still playing.

517
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,879
Rym: Yup, you've got like one token doff company.

518
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,417
Rym: You've got three shares in the presidency, and one token doff company with a five train and no cash.

519
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:42,538
Rym: Like, great.

520
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:46,320
Scott: Right, in 1817, if that happens, you'll go bankrupt.

521
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:47,108
Rym: Yup.

522
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:51,040
Scott: And you won't be playing anymore, but also it's very hard to go bankrupt.

523
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:56,120
Scott: Your companies can just liquidate, and maybe you can't win, but you can keep doing stuff.

524
00:33:56,661 --> 00:33:59,040
Scott: It's very hard to get to a point where you can't do anything.

525
00:34:00,181 --> 00:34:02,640
Rym: So, how does this game go?

526
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:16,337
Rym: Now if you haven't listened to our other 18XX reviews, or if you've never played one of these games, I suggest you check out one of those things first, because I don't want to necessarily explain the entirety of 18XX.

527
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,806
Scott: To explain the entirety of 18XX and also explain 1817 would take forever.

528
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:31,679
Scott: So I'll just keep it to the simplest possible explanation, which is that an 18XX game is a train game, there's an outside game and an inside game.

529
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:36,679
Scott: In the outside game, you are human beings who are wealthy buying stocks in train companies.

530
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:44,739
Scott: In the inside game, the train companies are the players, and they are playing a separate game of maps with tracks and shit, right?

531
00:34:45,301 --> 00:34:48,833
Scott: That inside game spits out money to the shareholders.

532
00:34:48,914 --> 00:34:50,600
Scott: in the other game, right?

533
00:34:50,821 --> 00:34:59,800
Scott: If you are the president of a company, you take its turn in the inside game, but the winner of the whole game is the winner of the outside game, right?

534
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:04,299
Scott: So you're investing in another game to win the real game.

535
00:35:05,461 --> 00:35:18,780
Scott: So in 1817, the reason it's so great is because in a lot of the other games, the outside game of the buying and selling shares is a very simple and restrictive game where turn order matters a lot.

536
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:23,100
Rym: Turn order matters a lot, and the decisions are usually extremely obvious.

537
00:35:23,344 --> 00:35:24,340
Rym: That is the best company.

538
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,249
Scott: And they're extremely limited.

539
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:29,991
Scott: It's like, okay, you can buy a share, buy a share in the best company.

540
00:35:30,092 --> 00:35:31,100
Scott: Okay, next person.

541
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,460
Scott: I sell all these shitty shares, and I buy a share in the best company.

542
00:35:34,921 --> 00:35:35,504
Scott: Next person.

543
00:35:35,826 --> 00:35:36,871
Scott: I start a new company.

544
00:35:36,991 --> 00:35:38,720
Scott: Okay, there's only eight companies to choose from.

545
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:39,846
Scott: I choose the best one.

546
00:35:39,866 --> 00:35:42,360
Scott: You know, it's like so few choices.

547
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:46,435
Scott: In 1817, you can start any company anywhere.

548
00:35:46,656 --> 00:35:47,580
Scott: Then there's an auction.

549
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,972
Scott: Then you can start short selling it.

550
00:35:49,992 --> 00:35:53,254
Scott: The companies are two share companies, five share companies, 10 share companies.

551
00:35:53,274 --> 00:35:53,940
Scott: You can merge them.

552
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,804
Scott: You can convert them.

553
00:35:55,106 --> 00:35:57,540
Scott: You can have one company buy another company.

554
00:35:57,941 --> 00:36:00,000
Scott: You can take loans and go out of business.

555
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:03,260
Rym: You can do whatever the hell you feel like.

556
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:11,930
Rym: One of our friends short-sold one of my companies, and then a little while later realized that was a bad idea because that company was just growing and growing and growing, and other people bought all the market shares.

557
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:13,900
Rym: He could not cover his short.

558
00:36:14,241 --> 00:36:15,739
Rym: He was paying dividends all the way to the end.

559
00:36:16,721 --> 00:36:16,923
Scott: Yep.

560
00:36:17,628 --> 00:36:19,340
Scott: All kinds of ridiculous things can happen.

561
00:36:20,885 --> 00:36:22,714
Scott: So, all the action is in the stock round.

562
00:36:22,855 --> 00:36:27,960
Scott: So, at the start of the game, you know, you got your private auction, the normal private auction, right?

563
00:36:28,763 --> 00:36:34,786
Scott: It works pretty similarly to the other ones except there's this government money, this seed money.

564
00:36:34,826 --> 00:36:36,580
Scott: The government wants trains to happen.

565
00:36:38,121 --> 00:36:40,319
Scott: So, there's $200 in cash the government's given out.

566
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,792
Scott: So, you bid on these private companies.

567
00:36:42,832 --> 00:36:44,040
Scott: They have these set values.

568
00:36:44,641 --> 00:36:51,769
Scott: If the winner of the auction ends up bidding, their highest bid is less than the face value of the private company.

569
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:53,120
Scott: Let's say it's an $80 company.

570
00:36:53,603 --> 00:36:55,694
Scott: The high bidder is paying $60.

571
00:36:55,694 --> 00:36:56,840
Scott: They bid $60 and that's it.

572
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,947
Scott: No one's bidding higher than that.

573
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:00,480
Scott: The government pays the extra $20.

574
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,120
Scott: So, the person who bought it and won the auction is getting $20.

575
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:04,346
Rym: Yep.

576
00:37:04,407 --> 00:37:04,960
Rym: You get subsidized.

577
00:37:06,162 --> 00:37:06,967
Scott: Yeah.

578
00:37:07,148 --> 00:37:09,060
Scott: And then, what do you do with the private companies?

579
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:19,659
Scott: Well, in the other 18XX games, you would usually start a public company and then sell the private company to the public company sometimes at cost, sometimes at a profit, you know, something like that.

580
00:37:20,463 --> 00:37:21,446
Scott: That's not how this works.

581
00:37:21,567 --> 00:37:27,810
Scott: Instead, in this one, you use the private companies to help you start public companies.

582
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:31,501
Scott: So, I want to start a public company for $200.

583
00:37:31,501 --> 00:37:32,182
Scott: I've got an $80 private.

584
00:37:32,202 --> 00:37:45,140
Scott: So, when I start it, I pay the private $80 and $120 in cash and that starts the public company and the private company is now part of the public company.

585
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:45,301
Scott: Yep.

586
00:37:45,441 --> 00:37:46,747
Rym: Now, there's pros and cons of this.

587
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:48,676
Rym: On one hand, so I have a $100 private.

588
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:56,693
Rym: I use it as part of the seed capital to start my public company, but now that public company doesn't get $100.

589
00:37:56,693 --> 00:37:58,660
Rym: It just gets that company in the power.

590
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,879
Rym: The private is in the company, but now my company doesn't have any cash.

591
00:38:02,741 --> 00:38:04,226
Scott: And it has to take loans to get cash.

592
00:38:06,253 --> 00:38:06,735
Scott: All right.

593
00:38:06,755 --> 00:38:07,678
Scott: So, that's the first thing.

594
00:38:07,718 --> 00:38:08,220
Scott: that's different.

595
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,860
Scott: The next thing, you start companies, these public companies.

596
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:14,620
Scott: You're starting two share companies, which means you own the whole thing and that's it.

597
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,832
Scott: There's no selling or buying shares.

598
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:18,400
Scott: They're just a two share company.

599
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:20,539
Rym: If I pay out, I just get all the money.

600
00:38:21,563 --> 00:38:23,540
Scott: If you withhold, the company keeps all the money.

601
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:31,689
Scott: And in other 18XX games, it's often a very easy choice whether you withhold or pay out and sometimes half pay.

602
00:38:31,971 --> 00:38:33,160
Scott: It's a really easy choice.

603
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:33,681
Rym: Yep.

604
00:38:33,701 --> 00:38:35,160
Rym: A lot of them don't even let you half pay.

605
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:36,242
Scott: Yeah.

606
00:38:36,282 --> 00:38:38,180
Scott: Some of them would even let you half pay and it's always obvious.

607
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:44,719
Scott: It's like always pay out unless you have to withhold and only withhold if you have to or if you're going to buy a trade right now.

608
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:51,020
Rym: I think I used all three options repeatedly in varying situations throughout the entire first game.

609
00:38:51,601 --> 00:38:58,460
Scott: In 1817, the buy, the payout, withhold and half pay options is a meaningful decision every single turn.

610
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:03,100
Scott: And none of the options are rarely obviously wrong.

611
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,960
Scott: It's like there's merits to all three every single time.

612
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:10,460
Scott: And it's an interesting decision that has huge consequences.

613
00:39:10,902 --> 00:39:19,360
Scott: You can withhold and pay off your company's loans and make your company really strong so its stock price will not get out of control.

614
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:23,180
Scott: You don't want the stock price to be too high because you can be short sold.

615
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,799
Scott: Unless it's a two share company.

616
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:30,900
Scott: But in 18XX companies and other 18XX games, you just want the share price to go up.

617
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,720
Scott: You don't really want it to go down ever.

618
00:39:34,021 --> 00:39:38,019
Scott: In 1817, you don't want it to get too high because it will be sold short often.

619
00:39:38,361 --> 00:39:41,860
Rym: Now in case you're not familiar with this concept, this is a real world stock thing.

620
00:39:42,944 --> 00:39:45,860
Rym: Normally you think I buy some stock from Scott, the Scott exchange.

621
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,068
Rym: I buy some stock in Scott.

622
00:39:47,391 --> 00:39:48,380
Rym: Later I sell some stock.

623
00:39:48,821 --> 00:39:50,620
Rym: I pass these certificates back and forth.

624
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,939
Rym: But imagine I don't have any Scott stock.

625
00:39:53,662 --> 00:39:55,654
Rym: And I sell Scott stock anyway.

626
00:39:55,694 --> 00:39:56,679
Rym: I basically sell an IOU.

627
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,220
Scott: You sell something you don't have.

628
00:39:58,381 --> 00:39:59,999
Rym: I sell an IOU to someone else.

629
00:40:00,861 --> 00:40:01,589
Rym: That is real.

630
00:40:01,852 --> 00:40:02,520
Rym: In the real world.

631
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,840
Rym: That happens in the stock market.

632
00:40:04,946 --> 00:40:05,932
Rym: It happens for a reason.

633
00:40:05,993 --> 00:40:07,260
Rym: It's probably good that it exists.

634
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,198
Rym: But let's not get into that.

635
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:16,140
Rym: But the problem is I now owe that person a real share of the stock at some point in the future.

636
00:40:16,601 --> 00:40:20,159
Rym: Which means either I have to give them a real share at some point.

637
00:40:20,941 --> 00:40:25,680
Rym: Or I have to pay them anything that happens to that stock.

638
00:40:27,321 --> 00:40:35,439
Scott: So I sell Rym a share of company X. But I don't have a share of company X. I don't own one.

639
00:40:36,441 --> 00:40:39,219
Scott: Rym, now, basically, he doesn't own one either.

640
00:40:39,741 --> 00:40:44,899
Scott: But he's got a contract from me that basically says, "Yeah, you have to pretend that I own

641
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:45,140
Scott: one.".

642
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,008
Rym: So company X pays out a big dividend.

643
00:40:47,169 --> 00:40:49,760
Rym: Scott has to pay me the dividend that I would write for it yet.

644
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:55,558
Scott: It's like Rym saying, "Hey, if I had actually owned a real share of company X right now, I'd be getting a hundred

645
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:55,858
Scott: bucks.".

646
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:57,123
Scott: But I don't.

647
00:40:57,223 --> 00:41:00,717
Scott: I just have an IOU from Scott that says, "I owe you one company X

648
00:41:00,757 --> 00:41:01,038
Scott: share.".

649
00:41:01,661 --> 00:41:03,960
Scott: So Scott's now on the hook to pay Rym a hundred bucks.

650
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,840
Rym: Now, in the real world, there's this concept of borrowing the stock.

651
00:41:09,507 --> 00:41:11,759
Rym: Like someone selling short borrows the stock from someone.

652
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:13,473
Rym: Or there's a naked short.

653
00:41:13,534 --> 00:41:14,180
Rym: It gets complicated.

654
00:41:14,843 --> 00:41:15,950
Rym: This is a board game.

655
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:17,380
Rym: It's not that complicated.

656
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:26,680
Rym: In the board game, the way this is reflected, if I sell short in someone else's company, I basically just put a short share marker to say that I'm short in the company.

657
00:41:27,343 --> 00:41:31,058
Rym: And I sell it to the market and get the cash as though I'd sold it.

658
00:41:32,503 --> 00:41:32,718
Rym: Free money.

659
00:41:34,102 --> 00:41:42,547
Scott: So this is really interesting because now short selling is A, it is a way to say, "Hey, that company is overvalued.

660
00:41:42,567 --> 00:41:44,899
Scott: I'm going to sell it even though I don't own

661
00:41:44,959 --> 00:41:44,999
Scott: it.".

662
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:48,200
Scott: And then it's going to go down and then I'll buy it back and make a profit that way.

663
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:51,254
Scott: That is the basic fundamentals of stocks.

664
00:41:53,142 --> 00:41:54,439
Scott: Buy low, sell high.

665
00:41:54,681 --> 00:41:57,440
Scott: Well, if it's already high and you don't own any, sell high.

666
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,877
Scott: And then when it goes down, buy low.

667
00:41:59,744 --> 00:42:00,858
Scott: It's just the opposite, right?

668
00:42:01,341 --> 00:42:15,480
Scott: But in an 18XX game, a game in which you don't start with a lot of money and you spent a lot of it on private companies, and all your companies are two share companies that you can't sell, you need to get cash to do business, right?

669
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:20,500
Scott: And the companies can take loans, but you can't take loans as a person.

670
00:42:21,124 --> 00:42:22,199
Scott: So what the hell do you do?

671
00:42:22,642 --> 00:42:26,100
Scott: You sell short in something to get instant cash.

672
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:32,340
Scott: You sell something you don't have and poof, a pile of dollar bills appears in front of you that you can invest.

673
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:38,578
Scott: And if that investment pays off and the company you shorted sucks, you're making money on both ends.

674
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:46,009
Scott: You sold something high, it goes down, and the money you got when you sold it high is making positive gains in a company.

675
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:46,879
Scott: you started with it.

676
00:42:47,421 --> 00:42:54,480
Scott: And then you'd use those positive gains to buy the cheapo share in the company that was failing that you shorted in, and it's good times.

677
00:42:56,100 --> 00:43:02,348
Scott: So this helps players who in other 18XX games might be stuck saying, "Well, nothing to do this turn.

678
00:43:02,368 --> 00:43:07,200
Scott: I got no cash and I don't want to sell anything," can instead say, "Well, what's overvalued?

679
00:43:07,281 --> 00:43:09,640
Scott: I'm going to short something and suddenly I'm going to do business.

680
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,476
Scott: There's a lot more activity because you can have a lot more

681
00:43:12,537 --> 00:43:13,040
Scott: liquidity.".

682
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:13,362
Rym: Yep.

683
00:43:13,464 --> 00:43:24,199
Rym: There's a little bit of pushy luck though there because in the real world, shorting stock, the common line if you talk to an investment manager or take a basic class in this stuff is-- Risky as hell, don't do it.

684
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:33,080
Rym: Shorting stock has moderate upsides and unlimited downsides, literally unlimited.

685
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:39,613
Rym: In the real world, I short Apple and Apple just keeps going up and up and up and up and up and up and up.

686
00:43:39,633 --> 00:43:40,460
Rym: I am fucked.

687
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:44,540
Scott: Yeah, so if I buy a share of Apple, what's a share of Apple cost?

688
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:45,180
Scott: Probably a fortune.

689
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:45,541
Rym: Yeah.

690
00:43:45,682 --> 00:43:53,260
Scott: Okay, so if I buy one share of Apple, whatever it costs, the worst case scenario, Apple goes out of business.

691
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:55,479
Scott: I lose the money I spent.

692
00:43:56,503 --> 00:43:58,596
Scott: Let's say there's another company that's only $100 a share.

693
00:43:59,360 --> 00:43:59,923
Scott: I buy a share.

694
00:43:59,943 --> 00:44:02,055
Scott: I can lose $100.

695
00:44:02,055 --> 00:44:02,880
Scott: That's all I can lose.

696
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:04,973
Scott: I put $100 in a slot machine.

697
00:44:05,154 --> 00:44:05,940
Scott: How much can I lose?

698
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,224
Scott: 100.

699
00:44:07,224 --> 00:44:13,460
Scott: Imagine it as a slot machine and you can lose infinity because the price can just never stop going up.

700
00:44:13,781 --> 00:44:23,339
Rym: And in the real world, at some point, you are forced to cover that share, meaning you are forced by law and contract to go buy Apple stock no matter what it costs.

701
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:25,460
Scott: And give it to the person you sold it short to.

702
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:28,301
Scott: Okay, I sold short when the Apple stock was $100.

703
00:44:28,301 --> 00:44:30,500
Scott: It's now a million dollars a share.

704
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:36,941
Scott: You just lost $9,999,100.

705
00:44:36,941 --> 00:44:39,180
Rym: So the shorting is really interesting.

706
00:44:39,763 --> 00:44:44,040
Rym: That's a way that unlocks the game by letting players have an option to take risks to get capital.

707
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,020
Rym: But the companies can also take loans.

708
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:59,700
Rym: The combination of the loans and the fact that half pay, full pay, with whole dividends are all valid options means that you have a lot of flexibility in how you run your company.

709
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,919
Rym: You can do things like take a bunch of loans.

710
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:04,980
Rym: Every time you take a loan, your stock price drops.

711
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:06,749
Rym: But you get capital.

712
00:45:07,275 --> 00:45:07,800
Rym: Use the capital.

713
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,980
Scott: If your company is overvalued, maybe take some loans to bring it down.

714
00:45:11,264 --> 00:45:12,159
Scott: That's a good idea.

715
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:15,360
Rym: Or maybe take some loans to drive your stock price down.

716
00:45:16,161 --> 00:45:21,340
Rym: Then buy back shares in the market into your own company treasury.

717
00:45:21,901 --> 00:45:23,680
Rym: Then next turn, pay the loans back.

718
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,259
Rym: Your stock goes back up.

719
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:30,720
Rym: And then you or other players buy those treasury shares and put even more money into the company.

720
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:31,821
Scott: Yep.

721
00:45:32,264 --> 00:45:34,240
Scott: All kinds of shenanigans are now possible.

722
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:39,299
Rym: We could spend an hour outlining all the shenanigans you can get up to with this simple set of rules.

723
00:45:40,044 --> 00:45:42,760
Scott: In other 18XX games, a company would be capitalized.

724
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:47,140
Scott: It would get its cash by selling all the treasury shares, and that would probably be the end of it.

725
00:45:47,381 --> 00:45:48,980
Scott: It wouldn't get any more cash ever.

726
00:45:49,541 --> 00:45:53,100
Scott: It buys trains with that money, and then it just never buys trains again.

727
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:53,876
Scott: The end.

728
00:45:54,842 --> 00:46:05,340
Scott: Unless some other company comes along with its money to help that first company out, that first company might just end up being ruined and ruin the president because they had to buy a train with their own money.

729
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,675
Scott: Here, loans.

730
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:10,275
Scott: It's like, oh, I need all my trains rusted.

731
00:46:10,295 --> 00:46:11,040
Scott: I need a new train.

732
00:46:11,443 --> 00:46:12,939
Scott: I'll take some loans and buy a new train.

733
00:46:13,884 --> 00:46:14,551
Rym: Ta-da!

734
00:46:14,591 --> 00:46:15,400
Rym: Saved by the bell.

735
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:21,720
Rym: Every time you take a loan, not only does the stock price of your company just move left in the market, like every loan, stock price goes down.

736
00:46:22,242 --> 00:46:23,697
Rym: Every payoff, stock price goes up.

737
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:32,500
Rym: Loans have interest, and the interest rises depending on how many loans everyone collectively has taken out.

738
00:46:33,802 --> 00:46:39,018
Rym: So every operating round, you've got to pay that interest on the loans you have not paid off.

739
00:46:39,828 --> 00:46:40,079
Scott: Yep.

740
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:41,611
Scott: That can be a problem.

741
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:49,939
Scott: This is why you're going to be half paying and withholding, so the company keeps more cash because the company needs cash to pay off loans and pay off loan interest.

742
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:50,425
Rym: Or emerging.

743
00:46:50,445 --> 00:46:51,720
Rym: Your company's in dire straits.

744
00:46:51,801 --> 00:46:54,480
Rym: You merge it with another two companies that has a lot of cash.

745
00:46:54,781 --> 00:46:57,840
Rym: Now you've got a five-share company that can pay off all its loans.

746
00:46:59,504 --> 00:47:06,380
Scott: And if a company merges or converts, there might be more shares in the treasury that can now be sold to infuse the company with more capital.

747
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:15,480
Rym: Yep, and the company now merges their tokens together, and now you have a larger space, a bigger footprint on the map to operate and make more revenue, theoretically.

748
00:47:17,024 --> 00:47:18,820
Rym: So there's two companies, two-share companies.

749
00:47:19,141 --> 00:47:25,800
Rym: You can convert them to five-share companies, there's a process for that, where you then get the opportunity to buy up treasury shares.

750
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:31,080
Rym: You can also merge two two-share companies together into a five-share company.

751
00:47:31,522 --> 00:47:39,320
Rym: And then five-share companies can themselves be converted up into ten-share companies, or two five-share companies can merge into a ten-share company.

752
00:47:40,182 --> 00:47:40,459
Scott: Oh yeah.

753
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,500
Rym: That's a whole aspect of the game by itself.

754
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,856
Rym: There's a big set of power plays around.

755
00:47:44,916 --> 00:47:52,920
Rym: things like make two companies that are near each other that kind of synergize, then merge them, take a bunch of loans, buy a giant train, and now you're cooking.

756
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:53,981
Scott: Yep.

757
00:47:54,423 --> 00:47:57,320
Scott: You can also, there's selling companies.

758
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:01,020
Scott: So if a company's stock price gets too low, they enter the acquisition zone.

759
00:48:01,541 --> 00:48:05,779
Scott: If a company is in the acquisition zone, any other company is forcibly buying it.

760
00:48:06,361 --> 00:48:07,080
Rym: Yup, for nothing.

761
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:09,940
Scott: Well, potentially nothing.

762
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:10,820
Rym: Yeah, for very little.

763
00:48:11,681 --> 00:48:15,100
Scott: If a company enters the liquidation zone, it just goes away.

764
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:25,037
Scott: So you don't get ruined by being in a situation where your company needs a train and doesn't have one, because the company will just go away.

765
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:27,260
Rym: That's the biggest difference of all train games.

766
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:32,960
Rym: This is a train game where, an ATX game, you are totally allowed to just not fucking buy a train.

767
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:37,260
Scott: But you will have to pay off any loans that are still in there.

768
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:42,620
Rym: Yup, the president of the company is on the hook for the loans of any company that gets liquidated.

769
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:43,628
Scott: Yup.

770
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:49,180
Scott: The acquisition part can be the forced acquisition if the stock price gets too low.

771
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:50,640
Scott: There's also friendly acquisition.

772
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:51,966
Scott: You can just say, "Hey, you know what?

773
00:48:51,986 --> 00:48:55,409
Scott: This company that's not doing poorly at all, it's for sale.

774
00:48:55,450 --> 00:48:56,156
Scott: Who wants to buy

775
00:48:56,176 --> 00:48:56,217
Scott: it?".

776
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,500
Scott: And just sell it and see what it's worth on the market.

777
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:04,140
Scott: If it ends up being worth more than its current stock value, you just made bank.

778
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:07,639
Rym: You basically got to buy all the shares in the company, but the game just handles it.

779
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:08,859
Rym: There's a whole process for it.

780
00:49:09,602 --> 00:49:18,540
Rym: But yeah, the company might not be doing well for Scott, but I have a company that would really, really be able to leverage all those tokens Scott's got.

781
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:23,380
Rym: I might pay a premium to Scott so Scott can cash out on that company.

782
00:49:23,641 --> 00:49:25,631
Rym: He's doing better, and I get all those tokens.

783
00:49:25,691 --> 00:49:26,556
Rym: Now I'm doing better.

784
00:49:26,616 --> 00:49:27,299
Rym: Screw everybody else.

785
00:49:28,242 --> 00:49:28,443
Scott: Yup.

786
00:49:29,289 --> 00:49:30,840
Scott: So many interesting, ridiculous things.

787
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:33,800
Rym: We haven't even scratched the surface of how all the systems work either.

788
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:34,641
Scott: Right, no.

789
00:49:34,742 --> 00:49:41,680
Scott: The one big thing that I think is the best is that so few things, the turn order matters.

790
00:49:42,181 --> 00:49:44,540
Scott: And when the turn order does matter, you can manipulate it more.

791
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:50,078
Scott: So the biggest way the turn order doesn't matter is that so many things are now auctioned.

792
00:49:52,001 --> 00:49:53,620
Scott: Versus before, where it's first come first serve.

793
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,586
Rym: Yup, even an IPO.

794
00:49:54,889 --> 00:49:56,400
Rym: I do an IPO, brand new company.

795
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:59,940
Rym: I say the price I want to open it at, like what's the share price.

796
00:50:00,402 --> 00:50:01,979
Rym: I say where the token's going to start.

797
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:06,660
Rym: And then we go around bidding on what that IPO is actually going to be.

798
00:50:07,021 --> 00:50:09,238
Rym: If Scott starts in the spot I wanted, I can outbid him.

799
00:50:12,581 --> 00:50:19,267
Scott: There's also bidding for the privates, and there's bidding for... Oh, if something is going to be sold.

800
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:22,240
Scott: If someone wants to sell a company, there's bidding to sell the company.

801
00:50:23,422 --> 00:50:23,843
Rym: Yup.

802
00:50:24,324 --> 00:50:26,329
Rym: And one other fiddly aspect.

803
00:50:26,349 --> 00:50:31,420
Rym: that's really nice, you can take loans at any time with your companies.

804
00:50:31,521 --> 00:50:34,039
Rym: Both during stock rounds and operating rounds.

805
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:34,972
Scott: Yup.

806
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:42,880
Rym: So during the stock round you might take a loan randomly, like in the middle of a stock round, to lower the value of your company.

807
00:50:43,321 --> 00:50:50,359
Rym: So it goes after some other company that is going to buy the last shitty 4 train so you can get the 5 train.

808
00:50:52,181 --> 00:50:56,557
Scott: Or you might be sitting in the stock round and saying, "Man, my company is going to get sold short.

809
00:50:56,638 --> 00:50:57,240
Scott: That's not good.

810
00:50:58,501 --> 00:51:00,654
Scott: It's valued at $300 a share right now.

811
00:51:00,754 --> 00:51:02,240
Scott: It's maybe worth $200.

812
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:03,365
Scott: Rym's going to sell it short.

813
00:51:03,687 --> 00:51:04,711
Scott: That's not a good deal.

814
00:51:04,852 --> 00:51:05,816
Scott: Let me take 10

815
00:51:05,816 --> 00:51:06,017
Scott: loans.".

816
00:51:06,704 --> 00:51:06,767
Scott: Yup.

817
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:09,506
Scott: So now the stock price went down to crap now.

818
00:51:10,608 --> 00:51:11,791
Scott: Rym can't really sell it.

819
00:51:11,931 --> 00:51:12,833
Scott: Rym sells it short.

820
00:51:12,873 --> 00:51:15,580
Scott: He's going to get $100 less per sold short share.

821
00:51:17,183 --> 00:51:18,980
Scott: And that's going to be good times, right?

822
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:19,801
Rym: Yup.

823
00:51:19,821 --> 00:51:24,620
Rym: But you can only pay off loans during one specific phase in the operating rounds.

824
00:51:27,490 --> 00:51:27,736
Scott: See it.

825
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:34,400
Rym: There's a lot else we could talk about, but I think another thing that's interesting is the train situation is very different.

826
00:51:34,721 --> 00:51:38,256
Rym: In the first OR operating round, there's an unlimited number of $100 2 trains.

827
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,235
Rym: So you don't have to play that game of, "Buy all the 2 trains.

828
00:51:42,255 --> 00:51:42,717
Scott: They rust

829
00:51:42,778 --> 00:51:43,220
Scott: immediately."

830
00:51:43,923 --> 00:51:45,247
Scott: And you can buy them with loans.

831
00:51:45,488 --> 00:51:48,800
Scott: So you can start a bunch of companies and get a bunch of 2 trains.

832
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:56,720
Rym: But the operating order in the first rounds only matter for tiles because everyone can buy as many 2 trains as they want.

833
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:02,958
Rym: So the choice is not, "How many 2 trains do I buy based on what everyone else is buying to get the game to a certain

834
00:52:03,018 --> 00:52:03,339
Rym: phase?"

835
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:05,144
Rym: Like, "Push it to green at the right

836
00:52:05,184 --> 00:52:05,464
Rym: time.".

837
00:52:05,925 --> 00:52:10,837
Rym: The decision is now, "How many 2 trains do I want for this

838
00:52:10,917 --> 00:52:11,278
Rym: company?".

839
00:52:13,124 --> 00:52:13,892
Rym: And then there's some 2+ trains.

840
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,540
Scott: How many are going to make up the $100 loan I had to take to get that?

841
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:19,161
Rym: Yup.

842
00:52:19,181 --> 00:52:20,447
Rym: There are 2, 2+, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 trains.

843
00:52:24,242 --> 00:52:29,680
Rym: The game is a long, slow cycle of trains that give you a lot of time to mess around.

844
00:52:31,501 --> 00:52:37,037
Rym: And the game basically ends when someone buys the first 8 train, or the first 8 train gets exported.

845
00:52:37,137 --> 00:52:38,160
Rym: Then it's the end of the game.

846
00:52:38,941 --> 00:52:39,121
Scott: Yup.

847
00:52:39,864 --> 00:52:44,700
Scott: So yeah, if you are someone who likes a stock market kind of game, right?

848
00:52:45,823 --> 00:52:48,820
Scott: Because the stock markets in other 18XX games are too simple.

849
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:54,980
Scott: And the train action is still there, but it's not as big as the train action in some of the other ones.

850
00:52:55,601 --> 00:52:57,679
Scott: Then this is the 18XX for you.

851
00:52:58,423 --> 00:53:02,540
Scott: If you don't want any trains, but you want stock market action, you should go play Black Friday.

852
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:07,280
Scott: The different game by Freedman Freeze.

853
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:08,310
Rym: I would like to play that game.

854
00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:09,180
Rym: I really like that game.

855
00:53:09,621 --> 00:53:10,938
Scott: I do like that game a lot, yeah.

856
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:16,460
Scott: But yeah, of the 18XX I've played, this one has the best stock market.

857
00:53:17,241 --> 00:53:19,819
Scott: There is still turn order, but it doesn't matter as much.

858
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:25,080
Scott: And it almost provides too much freedom, right?

859
00:53:25,342 --> 00:53:27,900
Scott: Just because you should, you could, and doesn't mean you should.

860
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:29,944
Rym: But that's a difference in feel.

861
00:53:30,004 --> 00:53:34,840
Rym: In a lot of other 18XX games, if you can, you often should with weird stuff.

862
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:36,699
Scott: Yup, exactly.

863
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:41,640
Scott: Whereas here, there's so many things you can do, but should you, probably not.

864
00:53:43,221 --> 00:53:52,120
Rym: So I think it's my favorite 18XX game, because the only thing I don't like about them is how little agency I have over the player order.

865
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:57,680
Rym: Which itself tends to control a lot of the opportunities you might have.

866
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:03,940
Rym: In this game, you have a lot of agency over the player order, well more so than you do in other 18XX games.

867
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:09,840
Rym: But also, you aren't as tied to that in terms of your opportunities.

868
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:18,240
Scott: Yeah, well I mean also the player turn order, it doesn't just matter as much, because in the other 18XX, there'll be like seven companies, that's it, right?

869
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:27,800
Scott: So you wanna go first, so you can sell, dump on someone, or buy a company, be able to buy the good companies, you don't get C&O or whatever, right?

870
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:29,780
Rym: Companies need to start anywhere.

871
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:35,600
Scott: There's a pile of companies, they're all the same, it doesn't matter, they're just different colors, right?

872
00:54:36,522 --> 00:54:38,799
Rym: Yup, pick the one that has the nice name, I like the big J.

873
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:44,340
Scott: And even if someone tries to start one before you, they're gonna auction it, it's not gonna just be they go first and get it.

874
00:54:44,541 --> 00:54:47,960
Scott: So, you know, whatev.

875
00:54:50,565 --> 00:54:52,700
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

876
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:57,860
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

877
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:03,220
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

878
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:06,160
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

879
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:10,420
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

880
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:14,436
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

881
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:18,679
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

882
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,860
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

883
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:48,260
Rym: And the GeekNights Patreon Patrons for this episode, our favorite train game, are... Alan Joyce, Heidi McNichol, Marty Green, Elinc E.G, Graham Finch, You Hold the Key to My Heart, Looked at My Kingdom, I Was Finally There, Clinton Walton, Ren from New Zealand, Ryan Perrin, Chris Midkiff, Dread, Lily Tenebrae, Just Like a Dude Guy, Chris Reimer, Finn, Shervin Von Harl, and a whole bunch of people who do not want me to say their names.

884
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:56,800
Rym: There were a bunch of people rocking in the chat of this 1817 review, and it looks like a few of you want to play a train game with us.

885
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,420
Rym: So join the GeekNights Discord, I posted the link in the stream, and hit the board game channel.

886
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:03,608
Rym: We'll get a game going, maybe.

887
00:56:04,010 --> 00:56:06,219
Rym: Give us maybe a couple days to get the right number of people in.

888
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:10,346
Rym: And we'll play some 18xx games on 18xx.net.

889
00:56:11,328 --> 00:56:13,592
Rym: But now, or 18xx.games.

890
00:56:13,992 --> 00:56:18,159
Rym: But anyway, now, I leave you with...

891
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:45,421
Scott: Oh, yeah.

892
00:56:56,245 --> 00:56:56,891
Rym: All right.

893
00:56:58,748 --> 00:56:59,657
Rym: Feels good.

894
00:57:01,621 --> 00:57:02,197
Rym: Inside.
