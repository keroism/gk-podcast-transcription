1
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,587
Rym: It's Monday, October 12th, 2020.

2
00:00:10,587 --> 00:00:11,028
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,994
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:14,035 --> 00:00:16,320
Rym: We are talking about bricking things.

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,818
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:21,681 --> 00:00:26,780
Rym: So, uh, we went upstate this weekend to do a long hike in the middle of nowhere.

7
00:00:26,941 --> 00:00:28,449
Rym: Like that's something I feel like I can get away.

8
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:30,460
Scott: It seems like I say that seems like a safe place.

9
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:31,424
Scott: Yeah, middle of nowhere.

10
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:33,294
Scott: There's no people you can't get sick right.

11
00:00:33,314 --> 00:00:43,690
Rym: coronavirus doesn't grow on trees Yep, and and even then if it did somehow I'm not out there like licking trees Like I'm just walking through the woods long distance, but you know, the trees are Having sex with your face though.

12
00:00:43,952 --> 00:00:46,143
Rym: Oh, yeah, but that's a problem I actually ran into.

13
00:00:46,203 --> 00:00:51,640
Rym: my allergies have been weirdly worse this fall than they've ever been and I don't know why.

14
00:00:53,061 --> 00:00:57,700
Rym: Like I've never had fall allergies before but I have them pretty bad this summer for some reason anyway.

15
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:01,200
Rym: So we're up by ourselves on a very long difficult trail.

16
00:01:01,682 --> 00:01:08,940
Rym: like we figured the more difficult the trail is the fewer people we'd encounter which was correct and We're like 15 miles into this hike.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,440
Rym: We're on our way back on this long trail from nowhere and we see two people coming up ahead.

18
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:22,164
Rym: So we pull our masks up and then pull their masks up but then they like try to flag us down to like stop us and we're like, oh and Then I realize the trouble.

19
00:01:23,147 --> 00:01:24,311
Rym: one of them is holding a phone.

20
00:01:24,592 --> 00:01:29,444
Rym: I can clearly see that they have Google Maps up and Google.

21
00:01:29,484 --> 00:01:30,915
Scott: no, there is somewhere with service.

22
00:01:30,955 --> 00:01:36,249
Scott: That's good, but Have Trails in it like not usually.

23
00:01:36,309 --> 00:01:43,319
Scott: no unless you ask for like biking directions and the trail is bikable It won't give you walking trail direction like it might be like.

24
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:45,226
Scott: hey There's a trail here like some trail.

25
00:01:45,267 --> 00:01:49,543
Rym: some very very popular big trails do show up if you zoom far enough in on Google But most don't.

26
00:01:50,145 --> 00:01:51,170
Scott: so also some people.

27
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:55,479
Scott: you can if you take photos and submit them They'll show up on the on the map.

28
00:01:55,661 --> 00:02:01,749
Scott: It's like you can click and see the photos people have taken from particular spots But it doesn't give you like a map you have to.

29
00:02:02,251 --> 00:02:05,344
Rym: so basically they ask us like hey Did you take the loop?

30
00:02:05,966 --> 00:02:06,769
Rym: and we're like loop?

31
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:08,013
Rym: There's no loop trail.

32
00:02:08,053 --> 00:02:09,558
Rym: We just hiked like 15 miles.

33
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:13,681
Rym: we've been hiking literally for like seven hours and They're like.

34
00:02:13,802 --> 00:02:20,513
Rym: and then like the one girl like looks really surprised and like her handshakes a little and the older woman is like I told you.

35
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:29,960
Rym: So we start talking to them and eventually like she holds your phone out and she shows it to us and They're trying to get back to their car.

36
00:02:30,402 --> 00:02:35,147
Rym: They've been hiking for hours, and they thought they were doing a trail loop And they're like if we follow the blue trail.

37
00:02:35,187 --> 00:02:39,447
Rym: It's a loop right and we're like no Who told you that?

38
00:02:39,468 --> 00:02:40,474
Rym: do you have a trail map?

39
00:02:40,495 --> 00:02:41,280
Rym: They didn't have a trail map.

40
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,060
Rym: They had nothing and I see their Google.

41
00:02:43,481 --> 00:02:45,407
Rym: They have a pin where their car is.

42
00:02:45,988 --> 00:02:53,935
Rym: it is far away from where we are and Google is just a green square like there's Nothing that zoomed in and they're not even looking at the topographical map.

43
00:02:53,955 --> 00:02:55,200
Rym: They're looking at like the driving map.

44
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:57,512
Rym: They clearly have no business being out in the woods.

45
00:02:57,573 --> 00:02:58,879
Rym: nevertheless not a trail like this.

46
00:03:00,834 --> 00:03:07,579
Rym: So The more questions they ask the more concern we are that how many how many miles are they from their car?

47
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,131
Scott: this they can Just walk back right you know because they had been hiking so one.

48
00:03:11,412 --> 00:03:18,856
Rym: it is like 40 minutes to sundown - we are easily hiking like three or four times faster than them.

49
00:03:18,896 --> 00:03:19,940
Rym: They are not fast hikers.

50
00:03:20,281 --> 00:03:34,219
Rym: They said they've been hiking for several hours, but the direction they came from Does not have several hours verse worth of hiking Unless where they came from is not where they think they're headed or they did something really fucked up.

51
00:03:34,902 --> 00:03:37,232
Scott: We could just tutor only two directions to go.

52
00:03:37,253 --> 00:03:37,293
Rym: no.

53
00:03:37,574 --> 00:03:37,795
Rym: No.

54
00:03:37,835 --> 00:03:38,940
Rym: This is a complex trail system.

55
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:43,034
Rym: There are lots of branching paths in this trail system, but how many parking lots could there be?

56
00:03:43,816 --> 00:03:44,920
Rym: there aren't really parking lots.

57
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:55,432
Rym: There's trailheads and okay where they described they had come from there is no possible way that where we were headed Which was the only trailhead in that direction was where they could have come from.

58
00:03:55,974 --> 00:04:00,392
Rym: so wherever their car was There is no way they could get back to that car before dark.

59
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:05,549
Scott: and well all they had to do is Get to the modern escape right to a road.

60
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:06,131
Rym: call an uber.

61
00:04:06,853 --> 00:04:08,840
Scott: Yes exactly that's them.

62
00:04:09,221 --> 00:04:16,547
Scott: They kept trying to ask for like help and at this point as much as uber is the worst thing ever and I've never used Them and hopefully never will.

63
00:04:16,688 --> 00:04:31,120
Scott: if you it they do have the advantage over Taxis or old-school car services in the you know because in the old days Before the uber types if you tried to call a car service on the phone That would be like hey send a limo to take me to the airport.

64
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:36,497
Scott: You couldn't get someone to show up in the in a specific random spot to get you like immediately.

65
00:04:36,558 --> 00:04:41,866
Scott: that wouldn't happen Right, but now it's like yeah Actually that is I think the one thing.

66
00:04:42,147 --> 00:04:51,026
Scott: the one actually new service that those piece of shit gig economy Taxis provide is yes Those are in some any.

67
00:04:51,086 --> 00:04:59,520
Scott: no matter if you're on a road somewhere if it's a road that a car can go on You could push buttons on your phone if you have phone service and a car will come quick enough.

68
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,243
Rym: Well, they give it this way.

69
00:05:00,263 --> 00:05:04,680
Rym: those services are fine except for the fact that they're exploitative gig economy if they cost.

70
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,048
Scott: I mean, that's also.

71
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,497
Scott: that's also true, right?

72
00:05:07,799 --> 00:05:17,152
Rym: So basically, I We give them our trail map because even though we I was using it to navigate like the rest of the way back to our Car I figured you're gonna get back.

73
00:05:17,172 --> 00:05:22,240
Rym: Yeah, we're capable hikers We we know how to do this, but I think you're gonna make it back where you came from.

74
00:05:22,481 --> 00:05:31,080
Rym: but when we handed to them it was clear that they didn't understand it and couldn't really read it and At that point we just bailed because we wanted to get to our car before dark.

75
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:37,347
Rym: So we wish them luck and I basically told them look follow this trail You're on until you see a green trail.

76
00:05:37,748 --> 00:05:45,640
Rym: turn right and follow that because I knew that if they did that It would be really hard for them to miss that green trail and it will take them to a road.

77
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:52,400
Rym: There is no parking on that road Like there's no trailhead there, but there is an actual road with a real number on it.

78
00:05:52,701 --> 00:06:00,889
Rym: So at least a passing car they could flag down in the dark or an uber could find them because I was confident there was No way they could get back to their own car on foot.

79
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,560
Scott: Isn't there a park person that you could call?

80
00:06:05,003 --> 00:06:09,520
Scott: Well, they had no way to in a park because they had a phone that they were using Google Maps on.

81
00:06:09,882 --> 00:06:12,880
Scott: They don't know who to call New York State New York State Park something.

82
00:06:13,722 --> 00:06:16,576
Rym: They could call 911 I guess but it was Google.

83
00:06:16,636 --> 00:06:16,736
Scott: it.

84
00:06:16,757 --> 00:06:19,229
Rym: you have a phone Yeah, and they didn't think to so.

85
00:06:19,289 --> 00:06:38,279
Rym: literally right before we encountered these people I was basically just bitching on the trail to Emily about like Like people just go out into these woods like not knowing what to do and that like almost all rescues in the woods are people Who just like walk out in tennis shoes with Google Maps and don't know anything Like never read a trail map in their life Don't know what trail markers look like have no business being out here.

86
00:06:38,662 --> 00:06:42,220
Rym: And then we immediately encounter two people who are clearly in this situation.

87
00:06:43,324 --> 00:06:44,152
Rym: So we get to the end.

88
00:06:44,172 --> 00:06:44,819
Rym: we get to our car.

89
00:06:45,141 --> 00:06:48,673
Rym: There's no other cars because there's like not many places to park except right.

90
00:06:48,734 --> 00:06:49,657
Scott: So their car wasn't there.

91
00:06:49,697 --> 00:06:53,798
Rym: there was one other car in that area.

92
00:06:53,819 --> 00:07:02,173
Rym: if that was their car I Cannot imagine how they got to where they were from that place.

93
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,399
Rym: It was not a two-hour hike.

94
00:07:05,246 --> 00:07:06,699
Rym: I think they just gotten super lost.

95
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,358
Scott: So it wasn't their car.

96
00:07:09,801 --> 00:07:13,899
Rym: Yep, if it wasn't their car someone else was out in the woods and the Sun was about to go down.

97
00:07:15,662 --> 00:07:18,740
Rym: I do worry that a lot of people are hiking because it is the one of the few.

98
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,950
Scott: Well, I mean, how long did it take to get from those people to your car?

99
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:25,000
Rym: our car about an hour if you are?

100
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:31,420
Rym: Extremely experienced at hiking because it was very rough terrain probably two hours for like an inexperienced hiker.

101
00:07:32,063 --> 00:07:36,499
Scott: So you couldn't be like hey follow us to our car and then Yeah, also I didn't.

102
00:07:38,366 --> 00:07:41,179
Scott: Well, I mean, but yeah, and then it won't be like, you know, we're gonna go this way.

103
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:43,427
Scott: Yeah, you know if you can keep up with us.

104
00:07:43,848 --> 00:07:54,742
Rym: Yeah, there was no way but as they left they were Clearly had start beginning to have the fight that had started when they encountered us and the older woman said I told you Mm-hmm.

105
00:07:55,447 --> 00:07:57,560
Rym: So I'm pretty sure we they had the phone numbers to call.

106
00:07:57,621 --> 00:07:58,189
Rym: They had their phone.

107
00:07:58,209 --> 00:07:58,777
Rym: that was working.

108
00:07:59,221 --> 00:08:04,378
Rym: Worst case scenario some Rangers had to put on masks and go out in the middle of that Find them and take them to their car.

109
00:08:04,869 --> 00:08:11,634
Scott: Oh, well I mean if you're a Ranger and That's the level of emergency is someone is alive and healthy standing in the woods lost.

110
00:08:12,115 --> 00:08:12,617
Scott: That's way.

111
00:08:12,657 --> 00:08:13,800
Scott: That's you're fine dealing with that.

112
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,324
Scott: It's your job.

113
00:08:14,364 --> 00:08:14,787
Scott: You're working.

114
00:08:14,807 --> 00:08:18,286
Rym: then anyway, it is actually most Emergencies on trails like that.

115
00:08:18,306 --> 00:08:19,309
Rym: right people just walk here.

116
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:27,700
Scott: It's like if it's not someone bit by snake or You know fell out of a tree or they got in a fight with a bear.

117
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:33,604
Rym: it's just You're okay Someone?

118
00:08:33,645 --> 00:08:34,250
Rym: it's like in tech.

119
00:08:34,654 --> 00:08:34,977
Rym: We're Monday.

120
00:08:35,361 --> 00:08:36,779
Rym: I'll tie it back before we get into the news.

121
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:40,840
Rym: Someone asked you a tech question and you don't think I will answer your question.

122
00:08:41,201 --> 00:08:45,760
Rym: You think the fact that they asked this question is a warning sign that they are doing something incredibly wrong.

123
00:08:46,121 --> 00:08:47,465
Rym: So you ask a follow-up question.

124
00:08:47,786 --> 00:08:51,840
Rym: that then implies you just go down a darker and darker path as you ask more questions.

125
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:58,980
Rym: XY problem, like I'm trying to get my my battery to charge for my house and you're like your house has a battery.

126
00:08:59,282 --> 00:09:03,526
Rym: Please explain tell me what this battery looks like Because it's a refrigerator.

127
00:09:03,546 --> 00:09:04,248
Scott: I worry.

128
00:09:04,288 --> 00:09:10,816
Rym: you were about to tell me about a room in your house filled with car batteries So you got any news.

129
00:09:12,221 --> 00:09:12,703
Scott: Do I have a news?

130
00:09:12,763 --> 00:09:15,713
Scott: All right, so this relates to our main bit today.

131
00:09:15,733 --> 00:09:17,259
Scott: It's where we got the idea for our main bit.

132
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:25,544
Scott: But this person who is a wealthy person is probably not a good person because they spent their money on a Ferrari at a time Like this.

133
00:09:25,786 --> 00:09:41,260
Scott: hard to be a good person if you own a Ferrari Regardless of where they listen, I mean Anyway, they bought a brand new Ferrari and they immediately took it to an auto place to have because they wanted to change the seat.

134
00:09:41,561 --> 00:09:46,048
Scott: Right, they wanted to replace the seat that the car came with with a different seat, which is you know That's.

135
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:46,460
Scott: you know.

136
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,940
Scott: If you're already the kind of person who buys a brand new Ferrari from the dealership, right?

137
00:09:50,261 --> 00:09:54,740
Scott: Then you're the kind of person who would like customize the car, you know, that's reasonable whatever.

138
00:09:55,362 --> 00:10:05,353
Scott: And what happened was while they were at the dealer the the repair place The repair place was like an indoor Underground garage type situation.

139
00:10:05,413 --> 00:10:06,679
Scott: It wasn't like outdoors, right?

140
00:10:08,461 --> 00:10:18,316
Scott: so there was no cell service inside the place where the car is being worked on and As soon as they like took the seat out of the car, they believe that what happened.

141
00:10:18,336 --> 00:10:20,284
Scott: All right Who know?

142
00:10:20,324 --> 00:10:35,798
Scott: I don't know how true this is, but their understanding was that there is some sort of anti tampering system in the car and The anti tampering system in the car basically said well someone's messing with this car and they're not supposed to right.

143
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,585
Scott: It's a very expensive car.

144
00:10:37,605 --> 00:10:58,275
Scott: So the car is now going to refuse to operate until You know the Ferrari has like, you know Confirmed right that yes that the car is, you know not been stolen or vandalized right Which is you know a fine security feature on something that cost two hundred fifty thousand dollars.

145
00:10:59,017 --> 00:11:14,355
Scott: the problem was Ferrari, you know it cloud Ferrari wherever they are right couldn't Remotely disable the anti tampering system because the car was not in you know Cell signal area, right?

146
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:15,000
Scott: He was underground.

147
00:11:15,662 --> 00:11:27,550
Scott: So I imagine they had to like I don't Get some dollies and like we or tow the car outside Somehow in order to give it give it signal and then somehow get Ferrari to unbrick it or something.

148
00:11:27,913 --> 00:11:40,979
Scott: It's just a you can read in this It's you know the I don't know how confirmed this is because it's just a thread on reddit But it's a believable story and there's a lot of comments discussing it and it's very interesting Because at least I have not heard of.

149
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:48,889
Scott: I've heard of cars having you know various Problems with drms and things like hey, you can't repair your John Deere cuz the DRM and stuff like that.

150
00:11:49,573 --> 00:11:54,397
Scott: but this is the first I've heard about a car just being Bricked by accident.

151
00:11:54,578 --> 00:11:56,950
Scott: It wouldn't surprise cars being bricked remotely.

152
00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:05,613
Scott: Well, if they have like a low jack style GPS theft detection where the owner is like my car is gone They just remotely disable it You know intentionally.

153
00:12:05,633 --> 00:12:17,147
Rym: so a common occurrence of that where there's a failure that bricks a car is very specifically Inflicted upon poor people who have secured loans for a cheap car from a dodgy place.

154
00:12:17,469 --> 00:12:23,835
Scott: where though Yeah, repo man installs a thing or they buy the car from a financier who everybody you make your payment It gives you a code.

155
00:12:23,855 --> 00:12:30,029
Rym: you have to key the code into the car or the car or the car bricks itself And if the car leaves a certain geographic region, it also bricks itself.

156
00:12:31,354 --> 00:12:32,509
Scott: Or you could disable that system.

157
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,375
Rym: Yeah, it's one.

158
00:12:34,415 --> 00:12:38,070
Rym: it's usually against the terms of your loan and the car will be repossessed if you disable that.

159
00:12:38,251 --> 00:12:40,560
Scott: How would they know if you had to disable it in some way?

160
00:12:40,601 --> 00:12:41,625
Scott: where it you?

161
00:12:42,067 --> 00:12:45,330
Rym: it knows That some of these systems are a phone.

162
00:12:46,493 --> 00:12:49,642
Rym: They have a cell phone in them basically and they phone right to check.

163
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:50,484
Rym: so every right.

164
00:12:50,504 --> 00:12:50,925
Scott: so it's.

165
00:12:51,045 --> 00:12:51,306
Scott: it's.

166
00:12:51,426 --> 00:12:57,349
Scott: it's reporting correctly But you've disconnected it from the car so it can't actually brick the car.

167
00:12:59,594 --> 00:13:00,822
Scott: Like you take the system out.

168
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,070
Scott: you put it like in your house.

169
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:04,942
Scott: It thinks you're just keeping the car at your house and the car works.

170
00:13:05,163 --> 00:13:05,263
Scott: Yep.

171
00:13:05,324 --> 00:13:06,830
Rym: It's hard to say that might be moderately difficult.

172
00:13:06,951 --> 00:13:08,783
Rym: I also don't think the car didn't say it'd be easy.

173
00:13:08,843 --> 00:13:09,085
Scott: It's just.

174
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:09,830
Scott: it's just possible.

175
00:13:09,917 --> 00:13:10,070
Scott: Yeah.

176
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:15,510
Rym: But also the kind of person who is in that situation probably does not have the bandwidth to do that level of yeah.

177
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:23,386
Scott: if you were smart enough to yeah, if you had the the the Skills to do that then you have the skills to make money to pay for a car.

178
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:30,330
Scott: Yeah, right You could sell those skills to other people who need the services and then you don't need those services anymore.

179
00:13:30,752 --> 00:13:32,142
Rym: but the moral in general was to get to.

180
00:13:32,183 --> 00:13:49,581
Rym: the main bit is Generally if something requires any sort of communication or has like a security system that can be accessed remotely you are potentially very much at risk of that communication link failing in some way like if I'm on a trip and my creative cloud needs to Be renewed because I haven't logged in in a while.

181
00:13:49,622 --> 00:13:50,245
Rym: I don't have internet.

182
00:13:50,527 --> 00:13:51,110
Rym: I'm just effed.

183
00:13:53,571 --> 00:13:55,318
Scott: So is any other news what is going?

184
00:13:55,358 --> 00:14:01,178
Scott: so I just want to mention that tomorrow is you know Because we previously talked about Apple's iPad.

185
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:04,828
Scott: I watch event which was in September and there should have been iPhones then and there weren't.

186
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:13,166
Scott: and The iPhone event is actually tomorrow the the 13th of October which might be today for most of you listening If anyone's the one person listening.

187
00:14:13,931 --> 00:14:17,744
Scott: So yeah, we thanks Apple for putting the Apple event one day after.

188
00:14:17,804 --> 00:14:21,620
Scott: I need tech news twice in a row I should raise a complaint Apple.

189
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:30,116
Scott: You're really messing up the gig night schedule here But we'll see if I replace this iPhone 7 or not because it's still working Fantastically and I don't really go out.

190
00:14:30,337 --> 00:14:34,450
Rym: I was about to say I feel like I'm not like even if my ancient ancient phone.

191
00:14:35,371 --> 00:14:39,948
Scott: Alright, I mean there's a chance that the new iPhone has like all the features I want and it's perfect.

192
00:14:40,008 --> 00:14:41,856
Scott: and it there I heard There is gonna be a smaller one.

193
00:14:41,876 --> 00:14:43,664
Scott: So I you know, it might be.

194
00:14:43,945 --> 00:14:45,637
Scott: if I am gonna get that one Why would I wait?

195
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:46,830
Scott: I would just get it immediately.

196
00:14:47,332 --> 00:14:50,684
Rym: But if you're not going anywhere just wait a year right at the end.

197
00:14:50,725 --> 00:15:01,022
Scott: the neck these the middle Right little update to exactly right exactly if they're not unbelievably perfect if there's like if there's any kind of a Say what's up for another year?

198
00:15:01,042 --> 00:15:07,810
Rym: Yeah Like I feel like I if my phone broke I wouldn't even replace it until after COVID calms down.

199
00:15:10,013 --> 00:15:11,828
Scott: Uh, I still need the phone.

200
00:15:12,351 --> 00:15:13,334
Scott: There's some things.

201
00:15:13,394 --> 00:15:18,070
Scott: the phone does that like the app iPad and I watch don't I guess navigating?

202
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,646
Rym: No, cuz my watch can do that without the phone.

203
00:15:23,513 --> 00:15:25,145
Rym: Yep, yeah, I don't really need the phone right now.

204
00:15:26,372 --> 00:15:29,509
Scott: Okay So I do use the phone.

205
00:15:30,974 --> 00:15:31,730
Rym: So it's about there.

206
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:33,590
Rym: I mean I make all my phone calls online.

207
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:37,650
Rym: Oh, and I also have a Google Voice number that isn't even tied to the phone that I can just use directly on a computer.

208
00:15:37,851 --> 00:15:39,660
Scott: So no, I use the phone to me.

209
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,147
Scott: I could make phone calls on the iPad though.

210
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:47,470
Rym: Yeah So I stumbled onto this while I was looking for an unrelated thing and it didn't make a lot of big news.

211
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:48,822
Rym: But basically what's going on here?

212
00:15:49,266 --> 00:15:49,710
Rym: Spotify?

213
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:55,657
Rym: One of the all the different music streaming services are all Really fighting over market share.

214
00:15:55,737 --> 00:16:05,569
Scott: like that industry is really locked in a race to the bottom for a lot of reasons And it's actually I just want to say as some you know, not speaking for my employer in any way, right?

215
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:12,498
Scott: This is my own personal talking just in case I don't think You know, I do work for a music publisher, right?

216
00:16:12,558 --> 00:16:25,389
Scott: So the race to the bottom is a problem for Music people in the music industry because what you have here is, you know, we finally escaped mostly, you know Music piracy, right?

217
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,756
Scott: So now it's like musicians.

218
00:16:27,796 --> 00:16:32,230
Scott: songwriters are getting paid when people listen to their music on Spotify or Apple music or whatever.

219
00:16:32,471 --> 00:16:52,224
Scott: Right people are legally paying or this advertising supporting, you know people getting paid when someone listens to their songs, which is good You know because even if I don't believe in copyright laws, I believe that creative people who are making art should get paid for it By some mechanism, even if that mechanism is not the existing awful copyright

220
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:52,806
Rym: capitalism,

221
00:16:53,368 --> 00:16:53,629
Scott: right?

222
00:16:53,709 --> 00:16:59,907
Scott: Exactly However, what happens here is you have Spotify Apple music etc.

223
00:17:00,008 --> 00:17:08,640
Scott: competing Right on features and also on price Right and by competing on price there.

224
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,626
Scott: They want to lower their price, right?

225
00:17:10,665 --> 00:17:12,010
Scott: They don't want to charge a lot of money.

226
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:15,665
Scott: They want to have more users because Apple doesn't actually want to sell Apple music.

227
00:17:15,705 --> 00:17:17,532
Scott: They want to sell iPhone Right.

228
00:17:17,874 --> 00:17:22,750
Scott: Spotify does want to sell Spotify, but they can't if someone's undercutting them, right?

229
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:31,410
Scott: They're happy to lower their price to get the most users Especially since a lot of their money does come from the free users who are listening to ads.

230
00:17:31,711 --> 00:17:42,110
Scott: Therefore more users is better because then an ad Spotify ad cost more because they will have more listens And that hurts, you know people always talk about Spotify not paying music people anything.

231
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:42,812
Scott: Well, guess what?

232
00:17:42,992 --> 00:17:49,189
Scott: Spotify charging less hurts music people because now there's less money to divide amongst same reason.

233
00:17:49,209 --> 00:17:49,450
Scott: writers.

234
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:57,012
Rym: Why the fact that a triple-a video game cost the same number of dollars today in 2020 that it cost in 1989?

235
00:17:57,012 --> 00:18:13,199
Scott: exactly the songwriters the musicians the music industry wants Spotify to charge more money which You know and then therefore there would be more money to divide amongst everyone who has music on Spotify Which makes total sense from their perspective.

236
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:16,709
Scott: but charging 50 bucks a month makes no sense because I'm not paying that.

237
00:18:16,909 --> 00:18:24,274
Rym: Yep Well, especially that's in the era when it became more difficult for me to pirate good music like around the time I left RIT.

238
00:18:24,675 --> 00:18:31,429
Rym: there was like an era of I didn't pirate a lot of music, but there wasn't streaming services yet I just didn't listen to as much new music.

239
00:18:32,451 --> 00:18:33,800
Rym: yeah, a lot of people are like that.

240
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:38,030
Rym: a lot of people music is a Secondary concern or a background concern.

241
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:41,704
Rym: They're not really gonna pay for the primary activity of listening to albums.

242
00:18:41,744 --> 00:18:49,050
Scott: Like that is a much smaller, you know You know YouTube videos that are a song or a music video are still like the number one, right?

243
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,024
Scott: But those all have ads on them.

244
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:59,590
Scott: Yep I mean you can also choose not to see those ads but that's all separate conversation anyway And I'm pretty sure a YouTube view is gonna get you more money than a spot a Spotify listen.

245
00:18:59,912 --> 00:19:02,890
Rym: So it's really hard to compete on price because what we just talked about.

246
00:19:03,271 --> 00:19:11,472
Rym: It's also hard to compete on features because there's only so many features you can give someone around listening to WAV files Pretty much.

247
00:19:11,492 --> 00:19:18,670
Scott: Yeah or mp3s or whatever kind of file you got listening to the modulation of air around your body.

248
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:25,570
Rym: There's only so many ways to make that experience more pleasant that are not even if there are newer better ways.

249
00:19:26,011 --> 00:19:27,296
Scott: We haven't thought of them yet.

250
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:28,340
Scott: They're harder to think of.

251
00:19:28,861 --> 00:19:33,174
Rym: Yep, but like make a playlist get Recommendations like that stuff.

252
00:19:33,315 --> 00:19:34,338
Rym: everyone has that stuff.

253
00:19:34,578 --> 00:19:38,470
Scott: Yeah, I can say though the Spotify recommendations are like I could switch to Apple music.

254
00:19:38,591 --> 00:19:40,018
Scott: I have all these Apple devices, right?

255
00:19:40,058 --> 00:19:45,525
Rym: It wouldn't you know, I found all the services Give me the same level of like high quality recommendations.

256
00:19:45,545 --> 00:19:46,450
Rym: They're all very accurate.

257
00:19:46,691 --> 00:19:49,881
Scott: Like I don't know what the Spotify recommendations have been better.

258
00:19:49,901 --> 00:19:51,004
Scott: I think lately.

259
00:19:51,165 --> 00:19:52,670
Scott: so it's like that's yeah.

260
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:56,370
Rym: Well, it's really like YouTube actually gives me the best recommendations.

261
00:19:56,551 --> 00:20:01,010
Rym: But and I think that might sometimes I listen to more music on YouTube than I do other services.

262
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:02,596
Rym: So YouTube has more data about me.

263
00:20:03,238 --> 00:20:04,904
Scott: So that's also true as I do list.

264
00:20:04,924 --> 00:20:06,510
Scott: I have listened to more music on Spotify.

265
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:07,789
Scott: Maybe that's why it's bright.

266
00:20:08,411 --> 00:20:13,546
Rym: So so the third way you can compete is lock in and that is where they're going now.

267
00:20:13,907 --> 00:20:32,624
Rym: according to a bunch of articles I found Spotify is going after developers of apps basically threatening to cut off all API access if they violate the terms of service and one particular clause that says you cannot help people migrate Anything to another service Under any circumstances.

268
00:20:32,704 --> 00:20:43,123
Rym: if you use our API's Not even like and I manually export my Spotify playlist Not that I have that many not easily like you can do a manual process.

269
00:20:43,144 --> 00:20:43,645
Scott: Oh, here I go.

270
00:20:43,705 --> 00:20:56,270
Scott: You can go to a You can go to a Spotify playlist and you can right-click and go to share and do Huh, so basically there's a time you can share it somehow.

271
00:20:56,992 --> 00:20:58,757
Rym: Yep, here's a public.

272
00:20:59,138 --> 00:21:09,874
Rym: that will basically be your single point of interface for all the streaming music services You subscribe to and do cool stuff and basically all of them now just recently Removed their.

273
00:21:10,275 --> 00:21:15,430
Rym: take my playlist from Spotify and recreate it on another service because Spotify is cutting them off of the API's.

274
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:16,312
Rym: Spotify.

275
00:21:16,474 --> 00:21:17,379
Scott: the point of those.

276
00:21:17,399 --> 00:21:23,545
Scott: wouldn't the point of those third-party Services be that you would make playlists on those third parties and then they would?

277
00:21:23,585 --> 00:21:30,544
Scott: that way you could mix like yes Exclusive and Apple music songs together in a playlist that would be on their service and not on Spotify.

278
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:33,416
Rym: Yes, but people have Exist.

279
00:21:33,436 --> 00:21:40,570
Rym: a lot of people use Spotify for a long time Like I don't know Spotify account and made a bunch of playlists in there and they want to copy those playlists to a different service.

280
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:47,074
Scott: Yeah, and I had not realized that you there is not an easy way in the Spotify UI to Export a playlist.

281
00:21:47,214 --> 00:21:50,223
Rym: and now that Spotify is going after the users of their API.

282
00:21:50,644 --> 00:21:52,390
Rym: It's very clear why that's not easy.

283
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:59,730
Scott: Hmm I mean iTunes I'm pretty sure still supports like old m3u playlists.

284
00:21:59,954 --> 00:22:09,508
Rym: in fact Their terms of service even specifically calls out you cannot transfer any content of any kind to quote another music service that competes with Spotify.

285
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:11,552
Scott: I You know.

286
00:22:11,633 --> 00:22:20,318
Scott: while I agree, you know if I make a playlist It's kind of bullshit that they don't have a way to export it great except for obviously manually writing it down and retyping it Right.

287
00:22:20,338 --> 00:22:32,031
Scott: Yeah But I do agree actually That if you have a playlist that was generated by Spotify's AI for example discover weekly release radar Right.

288
00:22:32,072 --> 00:22:47,803
Scott: It's like you can kind of see a valid argument for like, okay, you're using Spotify to generate your taking advantage of the AI on Spotify to generate a really good playlist for you and all the data it has and then you're gonna listen to that playlist on Apple music and Spotify is not gonna get any money for it.

289
00:22:48,004 --> 00:22:49,130
Scott: Yeah, even though they did all the work.

290
00:22:49,432 --> 00:22:52,554
Scott: That's there's some validity to that Argument there.

291
00:22:52,935 --> 00:22:55,145
Rym: Yeah, but I think most people have playlists.

292
00:22:55,185 --> 00:22:56,450
Rym: They made themselves like mixed.

293
00:22:56,550 --> 00:23:00,468
Scott: Yeah, if you make a playlist by hand, let me see if I made this playlist by hand.

294
00:23:00,488 --> 00:23:02,390
Scott: I Did.

295
00:23:02,893 --> 00:23:06,388
Scott: and yeah, it doesn't seem like there is a way to export it.

296
00:23:07,731 --> 00:23:08,414
Scott: So, oh wait.

297
00:23:08,454 --> 00:23:09,538
Scott: No, there's a download button.

298
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:12,530
Scott: Oh, no that just downloads all the songs into the cat.

299
00:23:12,571 --> 00:23:13,789
Rym: So I found one app.

300
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,297
Rym: I think it's called free your music.

301
00:23:15,318 --> 00:23:15,478
Rym: wonder.

302
00:23:15,498 --> 00:23:25,828
Rym: there's a million apps that do this stuff and they Have a statement where they were like We're gonna keep offering the service because we don't use Spotify's API or SDK to make it work.

303
00:23:26,209 --> 00:23:30,053
Rym: So they some sort of scraping Nice.

304
00:23:30,456 --> 00:23:32,870
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I'm sure if I really wanted to I could do it right now.

305
00:23:32,991 --> 00:23:39,870
Scott: I know how to computer but I For the perspective of just a Spotify user I right-clicked on a playlist and there was no option to do it.

306
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:51,207
Rym: Yeah But I think it is a worrying sign when Spotify starts going after the third way the lock-in path Because the lock-in path usually is the sign of a failing service.

307
00:23:51,709 --> 00:23:53,569
Scott: that yeah Well, I mean that works.

308
00:23:54,275 --> 00:23:57,617
Scott: I don't think Spotify is a failing service But I do think that there's just.

309
00:23:57,677 --> 00:23:58,722
Scott: there's just less things.

310
00:23:59,024 --> 00:24:12,703
Scott: all the certain music services they're running out of things to to compete on because the they already went through this process of getting all the different musicians and major Artists to relent and have their music on the services.

311
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:14,730
Scott: So they're not really competing on library anymore.

312
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:15,493
Scott: It's like you're real.

313
00:24:15,533 --> 00:24:17,138
Scott: It's really hard in nowadays.

314
00:24:17,158 --> 00:24:20,570
Scott: It used to be like Beatles aren't on there Led Zeppelin's not on there.

315
00:24:21,113 --> 00:24:25,535
Scott: I remember that now I did right and now it's like Everyone's on everything.

316
00:24:25,595 --> 00:24:27,783
Scott: It's like it's really hard to think of a band.

317
00:24:27,803 --> 00:24:29,650
Rym: That's you get you another situation.

318
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:36,880
Rym: There's enough content out there that where if a particular act isn't on one service the people using that service Just won't even know that band exists.

319
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:47,058
Rym: like welcome to the modern world Yep So in some other news Scott's always mad about Elon Musk and SpaceX.

320
00:24:47,499 --> 00:24:51,210
Scott: Well, you know all rich guys, you know, but he's a particularly bad rich guy.

321
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:55,450
Scott: He's like as close to you know, real-world Lex Luthor's you're gonna get in.

322
00:24:55,510 --> 00:25:01,280
Rym: He's getting real close to like the the company OCP in the Robocop Cinematic Universe.

323
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:04,440
Scott: Basically, I think that's what I think he does that on purpose.

324
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,504
Scott: I think it's like it's a goal.

325
00:25:05,524 --> 00:25:06,730
Scott: I don't think it's unconscious.

326
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:08,701
Scott: I think he's like yes, that's what I want to be.

327
00:25:08,721 --> 00:25:11,357
Rym: I just imagine at some point He's the one sitting in the room.

328
00:25:11,619 --> 00:25:13,190
Rym: Whereas someone were you here in the background?

329
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:17,103
Rym: Somebody call a paramedic cuz the robot just fucking like burnt someone.

330
00:25:17,123 --> 00:25:22,869
Scott: But anyway, that probably has happened Literally and already right effectively the same thing.

331
00:25:23,211 --> 00:25:28,550
Rym: So we're not gonna talk about the billionaire problem and we're not gonna talk about like injuries at the Tesla factory and shit.

332
00:25:28,731 --> 00:25:31,930
Rym: I think I heard so the news and there's a lot to this topic.

333
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:33,689
Rym: We're only gonna cover the top top top news.

334
00:25:34,054 --> 00:25:40,689
Rym: But if you didn't see it The Pentagon is basically contracting SpaceX to do the thing that we always assumed it would do.

335
00:25:41,311 --> 00:25:49,110
Rym: SpaceX and space exploration with humans, especially when the commercial side is involved is primarily not about exploration and research.

336
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:51,477
Rym: It's primarily about the military.

337
00:25:51,979 --> 00:25:53,403
Rym: That is how it has always been.

338
00:25:53,423 --> 00:25:55,289
Rym: That is how it likely always will be.

339
00:25:55,309 --> 00:26:07,096
Rym: and now people are reacting to this news that SpaceX is going to deliver a rocket that is designed to deliver a military payload Anywhere on earth within an hour.

340
00:26:07,116 --> 00:26:11,630
Scott: Well, I think what is clear, you know, what has happened, which we sort of realized years ago.

341
00:26:11,831 --> 00:26:13,781
Scott: But I think other people are starting to realize.

342
00:26:13,841 --> 00:26:17,738
Scott: as you think about, you know, the so-called Military industrial complex.

343
00:26:17,798 --> 00:26:22,994
Scott: right you think of these companies like Lockheed Martin Boeing Dietoles, right?

344
00:26:23,035 --> 00:26:42,368
Scott: Yeah, you think about these companies that make weapons defense machinery submarines, you know, right and they're all private companies that are in league with you know, the the Government, right and we give a lot of our tax money to them via corruption, but some legitimacy, but some not.

345
00:26:42,449 --> 00:26:47,430
Scott: right mostly not and That's just been what the US is all about.

346
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:53,706
Scott: And now what's happened is SpaceX slash Tesla slash Elon Musk industries, whatever the fuck you want to call it, right.

347
00:26:54,428 --> 00:26:57,830
Scott: at first Appeared to not be one of those companies.

348
00:26:58,011 --> 00:27:02,027
Scott: It was like a. it was almost like a consumer facing thing like buy a Tesla.

349
00:27:02,047 --> 00:27:02,730
Scott: you could buy a Tesla.

350
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:04,741
Scott: You can't buy fucking anything Lockheed Martin sells.

351
00:27:04,922 --> 00:27:06,249
Scott: I don't sell a damn thing to you, right?

352
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:08,954
Scott: So you don't cuss people.

353
00:27:09,255 --> 00:27:22,948
Scott: does normal people citizens right who aren't involved in directly don't view those companies The same way as they view SpaceX or Tesla or whatever the fuck he's got going on over there, right, but really there's no different.

354
00:27:22,969 --> 00:27:28,105
Scott: at this point It's like yeah this SpaceX slash Tesla slash whatever just is one of those companies.

355
00:27:28,627 --> 00:27:29,710
Scott: It's not really any different.

356
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:38,703
Scott: So this news is basically like if the news said Pentagon has contract with Lockheed Martin to make rocket that delivers weapons, right?

357
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:40,649
Scott: Yeah, I would no one would get no one would give a shit.

358
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:43,101
Scott: Well, this is that this is that news just different company.

359
00:27:43,141 --> 00:27:52,441
Scott: Yes, the news should actually be SpaceX steals contract from Lockheed Martin, you know Lockheed Martin stock goes down and SpaceX stock goes up there.

360
00:27:52,522 --> 00:27:53,510
Scott: Yeah, they're in the same industry.

361
00:27:53,530 --> 00:28:00,819
Rym: There's a very important point people really need to understand about like NASA and space with the US government Is that NASA does not do everything on its own.

362
00:28:00,859 --> 00:28:09,570
Rym: it never did at any point and these private companies are all involved on Government contracts and it's very complex how this stuff gets done, but all of that is valid.

363
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:13,569
Rym: There's a lot of valid criticism around the situation going on here.

364
00:28:14,071 --> 00:28:20,430
Rym: Especially why would be should we be investing so much in the military industrial complex during a global pandemic and the rise of fascism, etc.

365
00:28:21,331 --> 00:28:22,114
Rym: All valid points.

366
00:28:22,737 --> 00:28:28,678
Rym: the only thing I want to point out to the nerds who are mad about this Is that you need to be mad about it for the right reasons.

367
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:42,430
Rym: the capability that they're describing is not Particularly novel and is going to happen Anyway, similar to how the internet arose from the military industrial complex and then became also a private sector thing.

368
00:28:43,253 --> 00:28:56,378
Rym: If you talk about the US military in particular not all militaries on earth this primarily only applies to the US military because there are almost no other militaries on earth that have the concept of Real like global force projection capabilities.

369
00:28:57,081 --> 00:28:59,830
Rym: the US military is primarily a logistics organization.

370
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:04,301
Rym: the violence doing is actually like the end stop.

371
00:29:04,341 --> 00:29:13,866
Rym: there's like 50 steps before the violence happens at the end and The power of the US military and the value of it to the US as a entity.

372
00:29:13,886 --> 00:29:17,670
Rym: and again, yes There are a lot of problems with the power of the US as an entity.

373
00:29:17,931 --> 00:29:20,740
Rym: I'm not arguing that this is not the case right.

374
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:29,330
Scott: the main argument would be like yeah all these positive things It is doing we could just have that money go to a different nonviolent organization to do the same damn thing.

375
00:29:29,672 --> 00:29:29,793
Scott: but

376
00:29:29,833 --> 00:29:30,478
Rym: basically we could

377
00:29:30,498 --> 00:29:42,961
Scott: have invented the internet at the Technological research found it or whatever, you know something like that some other institution that didn't have an end goal of violence Right and gave them the same tax money to invent the internet since the

378
00:29:43,001 --> 00:29:45,669
Rym: beginning of the modern era like World War.

379
00:29:45,789 --> 00:29:51,370
Rym: one Type war has primarily began been and operate an exercise in logistics.

380
00:29:51,992 --> 00:29:56,970
Rym: So the most important part of the US military is actually probably transcom or u.s.

381
00:29:57,030 --> 00:30:03,749
Rym: Transcom which literally just get shit from one place to another place very similar like the same technique.

382
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:07,903
Scott: Yeah, it's like We've been in like we've people talk about forever war right?

383
00:30:07,943 --> 00:30:09,709
Scott: It's a great this forever war in Afghanistan.

384
00:30:09,729 --> 00:30:14,347
Scott: It's true Yeah, you know how much we don't make anything in fucking Afghanistan.

385
00:30:14,407 --> 00:30:17,057
Scott: It's not like Weapons factories there, right?

386
00:30:17,137 --> 00:30:21,308
Scott: It's not a command and conquer where your factory is five feet from your tank.

387
00:30:22,432 --> 00:30:27,830
Scott: The the tanks and whatever they're using over there is made far far away and we've been forever warring.

388
00:30:28,111 --> 00:30:40,650
Scott: We are constantly delivering and retrieving people food staff equipment right Non-stop right that is the most of the operation is the moving of the stuff.

389
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:49,490
Scott: Yeah in fact There's only one difference big using of the stuff is Costing way less energy and way less money than the delivering and retrieving of the stuff.

390
00:30:49,751 --> 00:30:57,035
Rym: there is basically only one difference between military logistics for transportation and Civilian logistics for transportation.

391
00:30:57,356 --> 00:31:02,550
Rym: the latter the primary goal is low cost and or efficiency.

392
00:31:03,832 --> 00:31:06,964
Rym: The primary goal of military is cost is not a factor.

393
00:31:07,104 --> 00:31:12,155
Rym: get it there as fast as possible The military side Also safely.

394
00:31:12,195 --> 00:31:12,375
Rym: Yeah.

395
00:31:12,415 --> 00:31:14,360
Scott: Well without anyone compromise.

396
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,588
Scott: Well, not only without anyone stealing it.

397
00:31:18,169 --> 00:31:24,145
Scott: Oh, yeah securely, but not necessarily All right, not safe for the people doing the delivering.

398
00:31:24,186 --> 00:31:28,360
Scott: they might get blown up But securely and that no one steals it now messes with it.

399
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,464
Rym: This is where it gets.

400
00:31:29,765 --> 00:31:31,330
Rym: This is why this is such a complicated issue.

401
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:34,059
Rym: There is an overlap between those two.

402
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:41,330
Rym: when it comes to things like disaster response Like imagine if a Chernobyl happened today or a horrible hurricane big disaster.

403
00:31:42,351 --> 00:31:46,766
Rym: The type of logistics you need to get help to people is the same logistics.

404
00:31:46,786 --> 00:31:47,890
Rym: You need to get harm to people.

405
00:31:48,171 --> 00:31:51,709
Rym: It's military style logistics not civilian style logistic, right?

406
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:59,814
Scott: Right UPS is not going to successfully deliver right water blankets Whatever you need.

407
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:07,279
Rym: ask someone getting paid that little to risk their life to deliver something somewhere But someone in a military type organization.

408
00:32:07,701 --> 00:32:09,930
Rym: their job is to risk their life to do the thing.

409
00:32:11,951 --> 00:32:14,670
Rym: So what this technology is fundamentally?

410
00:32:15,951 --> 00:32:22,630
Rym: Basically, the c17 is like the way Cargo gets delivered in up like when you got to get it there fast and it takes a while.

411
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:23,453
Rym: It can take about a day.

412
00:32:24,115 --> 00:32:28,150
Rym: This is a rocket that can deliver that amount of payload like one cargo container.

413
00:32:28,371 --> 00:32:31,883
Scott: Oh a c17 is worth of payload anywhere on earth in an hour.

414
00:32:32,526 --> 00:32:33,369
Scott: That's a lot of stuff.

415
00:32:33,549 --> 00:32:34,232
Scott: Yes It's not.

416
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:40,036
Scott: that's not like a that's not like a box in pub G right that is like supply I guess the way.

417
00:32:40,076 --> 00:32:42,470
Scott: I guess since it's going to space the weight also matters, right?

418
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:46,080
Scott: You probably couldn't deliver even though you could fit several tanks in like a c17.

419
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,705
Scott: Yeah, you couldn't.

420
00:32:47,926 --> 00:32:49,390
Scott: you couldn't deliver tanks via space.

421
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:49,953
Scott: They're too heavy.

422
00:32:49,973 --> 00:32:51,220
Scott: Yeah, but you could deliver.

423
00:32:51,501 --> 00:32:52,888
Scott: you could deliver a planes worth of food.

424
00:32:53,069 --> 00:32:56,038
Rym: now I do not know for all my food.

425
00:32:56,238 --> 00:33:00,510
Rym: I do not know a lot about modern transportation infrastructure in the military.

426
00:33:00,852 --> 00:33:03,229
Rym: I don't know a lot about how much they see 17 can deliver.

427
00:33:03,812 --> 00:33:09,008
Rym: I do know the big the u.s This does not make c17s anymore and there's actually starting to be a crazy.

428
00:33:09,108 --> 00:33:12,509
Rym: is now The existing c17s don't break any?

429
00:33:13,613 --> 00:33:16,121
Scott: Okay But I mean they also use boats.

430
00:33:16,484 --> 00:33:18,916
Rym: boats are good Yeah, but they don't serve the same purpose.

431
00:33:18,956 --> 00:33:23,569
Scott: boats take orders of magnitude longer, of course, but they could deliver way more shit Yep.

432
00:33:23,971 --> 00:33:30,690
Rym: But imagine a disaster where we need to get supplies to a town to survive the next week.

433
00:33:31,031 --> 00:33:36,489
Rym: What before like a supply chain can be created to get through the disaster area to get there.

434
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:50,970
Rym: Military logistics is the only way to do that and this type of technology can be used equally to Deliver harm doing materials to do harm and deliver life-saving materials to save lives.

435
00:33:51,313 --> 00:33:53,510
Rym: The problem is never the technology.

436
00:33:53,891 --> 00:33:58,610
Rym: It's the priorities of the civilization that's funding it and how they choose to use those resources.

437
00:33:59,032 --> 00:33:59,715
Rym: There are great.

438
00:33:59,736 --> 00:34:00,520
Scott: there is a question.

439
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:07,130
Scott: there is a question though always to be asked though It's like, you know when you have airplanes how much is a rocket ever really necessary?

440
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:09,730
Scott: Like when is the airplane not good enough and you need to use the rocket?

441
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:14,706
Rym: So the difference is and this is where I'm being a little soft because I don't like.

442
00:34:14,847 --> 00:34:17,995
Rym: I am NOT an expert That's at all at this point.

443
00:34:18,377 --> 00:34:22,730
Rym: I'm an expert in like this type this technology from 50 years ago because I'm a nerd.

444
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:25,130
Rym: Basically.

445
00:34:26,514 --> 00:34:35,330
Rym: Imagine you have to deliver Important supplies that only are available from certain places to somewhere on the other side of the globe like a remote location.

446
00:34:36,315 --> 00:34:37,222
Rym: It could take 20.

447
00:34:37,222 --> 00:34:38,409
Scott: how often does this happen?

448
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,454
Rym: Disasters and wars like.

449
00:34:40,534 --> 00:34:41,777
Rym: rarely this is not.

450
00:34:41,818 --> 00:34:52,409
Rym: you don't use this like every day like saying we're going to use this Technology is like on the level of we're gonna launch a rocket Literally because it's launching a rocket.

451
00:34:53,251 --> 00:34:58,550
Rym: So this is a capability that it probably does make sense for humans to have.

452
00:34:59,414 --> 00:35:05,667
Rym: The problems you should be railing at are all the problems We already talked about not the existence of this specific technology.

453
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:09,021
Scott: also Keep in mind the you know, the the military.

454
00:35:09,061 --> 00:35:11,050
Scott: the budget is so ridiculous, right?

455
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:11,915
Scott: There's so much money.

456
00:35:12,378 --> 00:35:17,422
Scott: most of these things these contracts They hand out to companies or whatever to develop this or that.

457
00:35:17,984 --> 00:35:20,915
Scott: a lot of it is just pie in the sky Stuff that it's like.

458
00:35:20,996 --> 00:35:22,804
Scott: maybe they invent it and don't use it.

459
00:35:22,964 --> 00:35:26,439
Scott: It does never goes into production It never proves to actually be useful.

460
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,303
Scott: Maybe they try.

461
00:35:27,343 --> 00:35:28,870
Scott: it doesn't even work, right?

462
00:35:29,231 --> 00:35:31,709
Scott: Yeah, you know that they're constantly doing that stuff.

463
00:35:32,091 --> 00:35:33,277
Scott: That's like every damn day.

464
00:35:33,317 --> 00:35:37,294
Scott: if you go look, you know send some FYI requests or look at stuff That's already public at like.

465
00:35:37,595 --> 00:35:40,325
Scott: what is the Pentagon spending its research money on?

466
00:35:40,365 --> 00:35:41,650
Scott: what's DARPA up to whatever?

467
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:45,846
Scott: It's like you're gonna see a lot of crazy shit that they're working on and get mad.

468
00:35:45,966 --> 00:35:46,528
Scott: So think about it.

469
00:35:46,568 --> 00:35:58,832
Rym: this way though It's like the slowest way to do something is civilian boat transport and then there's faster but more costly not just in terms of dollars but in terms of risk in terms of climate change in terms of Societal

470
00:35:58,872 --> 00:36:03,185
Scott: I'd say the slowest way would be civilian pigeon transport.

471
00:36:03,566 --> 00:36:04,810
Rym: Well, it depends on where you're going.

472
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:06,878
Rym: Let's say it's like you're trying to deliver something.

473
00:36:06,939 --> 00:36:09,770
Scott: I guess I guess a pigeon flies faster than a person walking.

474
00:36:09,931 --> 00:36:26,516
Rym: let's say you're trying to deliver critical X like technological and human aid supplies from military based in the United States like a supply depot to like the Horn of Africa for some reason or Antarctica because there's some like us.

475
00:36:27,058 --> 00:36:30,969
Rym: a science of the thing happened down there and we got to get some supplies down there.

476
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:34,190
Scott: Okay You know what the thing to steal?

477
00:36:35,672 --> 00:36:36,156
Rym: That's great.

478
00:36:36,196 --> 00:36:49,498
Rym: Now the thing has all of our guns And he learned how to use a. Anyway, it's time for things of the day.

479
00:36:51,366 --> 00:36:52,579
Scott: The thing of our day.

480
00:36:54,163 --> 00:36:55,311
Rym: Not that thing though.

481
00:36:55,331 --> 00:36:59,626
Rym: It is adjacent to the thing Tenuously your thing of the day at least.

482
00:37:00,368 --> 00:37:01,190
Scott: What was it again?

483
00:37:01,211 --> 00:37:03,096
Rym: All right, so scale abroad.

484
00:37:03,457 --> 00:37:05,704
Scott: Yeah, it's Halloween It's Halloween times.

485
00:37:05,945 --> 00:37:10,480
Scott: So the skeleton energy is is back especially because the Home Depot skeleton exists.

486
00:37:11,321 --> 00:37:13,350
Rym: Yeah, I want to buy that Home Depot skeleton.

487
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:16,840
Scott: so bad, I don't want to give Home Depot any money I know but I want that skeleton.

488
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:22,543
Rym: I want to just assemble it in the park courtyard behind my building in the middle of the night and never say a word about it.

489
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,389
Scott: I Think people would know because they'd see it get delivered.

490
00:37:25,872 --> 00:37:27,460
Rym: I know I got to figure out a way to make this happen.

491
00:37:27,641 --> 00:37:31,427
Rym: Maybe I should set it up in a public park in the middle of the night anyway, anyway.

492
00:37:32,841 --> 00:37:35,154
Scott: so this person has a nice fake skeleton.

493
00:37:35,174 --> 00:37:45,801
Scott: they got you know, and They put in a t-shirt on it that says What hide-and-seek champion or something about of 2020 of 2020?

494
00:37:45,801 --> 00:37:47,408
Scott: And you think you're watching this video.

495
00:37:47,428 --> 00:38:00,051
Scott: It's just a little Twitter video and you're thinking when this video is going They're just gonna hide the skeleton somewhere and I thought the video was gonna be like, okay Then they would play hide-and-seek with a kid and the kid would find the skeleton or right.

496
00:38:00,436 --> 00:38:03,997
Scott: but No, the video goes to a much more hilarious place.

497
00:38:04,037 --> 00:38:06,868
Scott: you can That I did not see coming.

498
00:38:07,109 --> 00:38:10,500
Scott: and mad props to whoever made this video and thought of this clever idea.

499
00:38:10,681 --> 00:38:12,650
Scott: You are a skeleton champion.

500
00:38:12,871 --> 00:38:14,840
Rym: It is no spoilers to watch the video.

501
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,647
Rym: The video is 39 seconds long.

502
00:38:16,807 --> 00:38:18,574
Rym: Like I think you can you can watch.

503
00:38:18,775 --> 00:38:19,578
Scott: I think you have 39 seconds.

504
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,895
Scott: You're wasted a lot more than 39 seconds.

505
00:38:21,935 --> 00:38:22,440
Scott: Listen to us.

506
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,379
Rym: We've talked about this video for well more than 39 seconds already.

507
00:38:26,242 --> 00:38:33,000
Rym: I know right, but all I'll say is that this type of prank very much has good night for flying energy.

508
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:38,100
Rym: Mmm, like it's that level which is my favorite kind of prank on earth.

509
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:47,398
Rym: So, you know, you might have a house and if you have a house in the US, there's a decent chance at some point Raccoons are gonna get into your fucking house.

510
00:38:49,102 --> 00:38:52,259
Scott: Like if you live in an area with our coons, there's no like raccoons in Florida, right?

511
00:38:52,601 --> 00:38:53,386
Rym: Yeah, there are.

512
00:38:53,547 --> 00:38:55,620
Rym: there's raccoons I think almost everywhere in North America.

513
00:38:56,282 --> 00:38:57,686
Scott: I've never seen a raccoon in Florida.

514
00:38:57,706 --> 00:39:00,113
Rym: raccoons are very widespread.

515
00:39:00,133 --> 00:39:02,360
Rym: Do I need to pull up the map of raccoon habitat?

516
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,370
Scott: I've seen I mean there's raccoons clearly everywhere north of that right?

517
00:39:08,152 --> 00:39:10,980
Rym: Let's see a map of where our raccoons in North America.

518
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:15,093
Rym: Let me find a map all of North America literally all of it except the alright.

519
00:39:15,133 --> 00:39:16,718
Scott: Well, I've never seen a record.

520
00:39:16,839 --> 00:39:19,177
Rym: also much of Central America.

521
00:39:19,197 --> 00:39:22,680
Rym: Oh In fact what last time we were in Costa Rica.

522
00:39:23,781 --> 00:39:28,303
Rym: but if I remember a great moment, we're eating dinner at this fancy outdoor place and Bunch of raccoons.

523
00:39:28,323 --> 00:39:36,440
Rym: just kind of wander up and like I feel a tug at my leg and I look down and there's a raccoon Just like tugging on my pants and when I look down at him, he holds his hands up and starts begging.

524
00:39:37,401 --> 00:39:38,685
Scott: All right, you know, they're smart.

525
00:39:38,905 --> 00:39:39,748
Rym: Yeah, they know what's up.

526
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:49,318
Rym: So basically if raccoons get into your house like what do you you call an animal like rescue type plays they will show up and Deal with the raccoons.

527
00:39:50,862 --> 00:39:51,609
Scott: That's not what we did.

528
00:39:52,094 --> 00:39:52,619
Rym: What did you do?

529
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,808
Scott: We just locked the trash.

530
00:39:54,869 --> 00:39:56,120
Scott: We just locked the trash cans harder.

531
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:04,027
Rym: No, I'm talking like if they're in your house like they're in in the house And they're living in the shed.

532
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:06,778
Scott: we kept them out that we did never let them get in the house.

533
00:40:06,798 --> 00:40:07,440
Scott: they were always outside.

534
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:10,380
Rym: Yeah, there's like they don't get in your house unless you don't maintain your house.

535
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,510
Rym: But it happens like there's ways raccoons get in.

536
00:40:13,093 --> 00:40:14,640
Rym: so when they're actually in your house.

537
00:40:15,981 --> 00:40:18,349
Rym: What this video is is it's a channel that I subscribe to.

538
00:40:18,389 --> 00:40:19,232
Rym: that is great called gates.

539
00:40:19,272 --> 00:40:20,857
Rym: wildlife control these people.

540
00:40:20,897 --> 00:40:26,140
Rym: there are Inhumane people who will just like murder them and like get them out of your house.

541
00:40:26,822 --> 00:40:30,735
Rym: Oh, yeah, but there are much better places that usually charge less money to.

542
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:36,702
Rym: that will get rid of them But they'll do it in a nice way and this is one of those companies and this yeah I would.

543
00:40:36,742 --> 00:40:42,480
Scott: my guess would be you get some sort of bait in a trap that doesn't hurt them and then you take the track Anything you do with like a straight.

544
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:45,754
Scott: It's basically the same thing you just supposed to do with stray cats is where you catch them.

545
00:40:45,815 --> 00:40:47,964
Scott: you take them to get spayed or neutered Then you release them again.

546
00:40:48,025 --> 00:40:48,929
Rym: So this video is that.

547
00:40:48,969 --> 00:40:51,260
Rym: but what's cool about it is, you know, we're in our friend group.

548
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:55,860
Rym: We've been having a lot of fun talking about people failing to correctly fell a tree.

549
00:40:56,422 --> 00:40:58,290
Rym: So this is a video that sort of explains.

550
00:40:58,651 --> 00:41:03,480
Rym: here is how you safely and humanely Get raccoons and raccoon babies out of your attic.

551
00:41:03,741 --> 00:41:04,826
Rym: Like what does this look like?

552
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:08,684
Rym: and the guy explains every step of the way like alright, I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do that.

553
00:41:09,105 --> 00:41:11,314
Rym: and the best part about these videos is the baby box.

554
00:41:11,615 --> 00:41:12,780
Rym: because basically what they do?

555
00:41:13,344 --> 00:41:22,000
Rym: they scare the mom away and Then they get the babies out and they put the babies in a box that can't be open from the inside But could be opened by the outside.

556
00:41:22,444 --> 00:41:33,460
Rym: They leave it outside The place they scared the mom out of because they know the mom is gonna come back that night Get the babies and take them somewhere else like and it explains in detail this whole process.

557
00:41:34,104 --> 00:41:40,280
Rym: Not only do you get all that detail and you'll learn a lot But you get to see a whole bunch of really cute baby raccoons.

558
00:41:41,142 --> 00:41:47,504
Scott: I think the key thing there obviously is you don't want to leave, you know, after you trap the raccoons You can't.

559
00:41:47,524 --> 00:41:48,410
Scott: you can't just leave them there.

560
00:41:48,451 --> 00:41:52,406
Scott: You got to make sure you get the trap Like failure mode.

561
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:53,188
Scott: I think that happens.

562
00:41:53,228 --> 00:41:58,620
Scott: a lot is like people will trap animals and like forget and then that's about people will do that.

563
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:05,052
Rym: People will trap a mother raccoon leave release her in the woods somewhere But leave the babies in their attic and then that leads to a tragedy.

564
00:42:05,172 --> 00:42:06,940
Rym: like that happens a lot because people are stupid.

565
00:42:08,562 --> 00:42:12,278
Rym: This video just goes into all that detail and it's just fascinating and adorable.

566
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,411
Rym: In the meta moment we're not reading stuff.

567
00:42:17,491 --> 00:42:20,524
Rym: cuz where we give enough time I don't know what you want.

568
00:42:21,067 --> 00:42:21,850
Scott: and in the meta moment.

569
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:24,420
Scott: There are no conventions on the schedule whatsoever.

570
00:42:24,561 --> 00:42:25,587
Rym: Thanks unplugged.

571
00:42:25,607 --> 00:42:27,700
Rym: zero finally announced that they are canceled.

572
00:42:28,101 --> 00:42:30,630
Scott: Thus we knew that they were canceled for a long time.

573
00:42:30,791 --> 00:42:35,093
Scott: still pretty sure there are not even any online conventions for us to go to.

574
00:42:36,522 --> 00:42:38,368
Rym: Maybe there are online convention.

575
00:42:38,749 --> 00:42:45,290
Scott: Yeah, tell us or tell the convention to have us And maybe we'll go to it or something.

576
00:42:45,371 --> 00:42:45,813
Scott: I don't know.

577
00:42:45,933 --> 00:42:47,440
Rym: Yeah, we've done a bunch of stuff at cons.

578
00:42:47,842 --> 00:42:51,040
Rym: I have the video from our panel at PAX online.

579
00:42:52,162 --> 00:42:53,871
Rym: I have a director's cut of that.

580
00:42:54,112 --> 00:42:55,700
Rym: that will be up on our channel this week.

581
00:42:55,900 --> 00:43:16,240
Rym: So if you miss that panel and you don't want to watch it in the middle of like a nine-hour video of That theater from the day our panel happened to be I have a director's cut that actually Has a little more content and is edited a little bit differently and uses our overlays and our camera angles instead of the PAX Overlay and the PAX camera angle, so that'll be up this week.

582
00:43:16,602 --> 00:43:18,654
Rym: I'm gonna do the same thing for our other panel.

583
00:43:18,694 --> 00:43:27,672
Scott: if you are a chance If you're looking for a convention atmosphere and there's no conventions to go to you should come to The official GeekNights' discord.

584
00:43:27,853 --> 00:43:28,940
Scott: you can find links to it.

585
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:37,880
Rym: I guess if you come to our website if I could come or our forum I'm gonna make an invite link right now while we're doing the main bit and I'll post it in the chat of the live stream.

586
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:41,818
Rym: Okay, it'll last like 48 hours sure.

587
00:43:42,844 --> 00:43:46,020
Scott: But yeah, you should Go to our YouTube stream.

588
00:43:46,140 --> 00:44:03,049
Scott: We stream all GeekNights episodes live and there's probably some things that you will hear there that will like a few sentences Maybe that are edited out of the actual mp3 that's loaded to Whatever service we're on every single podcasting service even the new shitty ones like Amazon Google's buy everything.

589
00:44:03,149 --> 00:44:03,590
Scott: We're everywhere.

590
00:44:04,821 --> 00:44:06,849
Rym: Also, I read your raccoon wounds.

591
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:09,880
Scott: Ah, yeah, I've been biking to nowhere.

592
00:44:10,302 --> 00:44:20,774
Scott: I just finished a six-week bike to nowhere program in the bike to nowhere app And when I bike to nowhere I turn on the twitch stream because then I can talk to someone while I'm biking to nowhere.

593
00:44:20,815 --> 00:44:23,962
Scott: it makes it much less sad.

594
00:44:24,535 --> 00:44:30,179
Rym: also Playing a lot of Star Wars squadrons that if you're also playing that I'd be happy to suit up and fly with you.

595
00:44:31,104 --> 00:44:33,940
Scott: Yeah, so if you want to come and talk to us you can come to our discord.

596
00:44:34,361 --> 00:44:37,632
Scott: You can come to my bike twitch stream.

597
00:44:37,672 --> 00:44:39,799
Scott: you can come, you know, we're every every single place.

598
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:40,240
Scott: We're there.

599
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,065
Scott: You're listening to this.

600
00:44:41,105 --> 00:44:41,648
Scott: You already know.

601
00:44:41,668 --> 00:44:43,719
Scott: Yeah, you already know where we are, right?

602
00:44:44,761 --> 00:44:45,867
Scott: So come on down.

603
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:49,225
Rym: All right, let's just get right into it Breaking stuff.

604
00:44:49,425 --> 00:44:53,142
Rym: We never really talked about this except tangentially talking about other things Like.

605
00:44:53,423 --> 00:44:54,752
Rym: I think we even mentioned it recently.

606
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:56,503
Rym: we did that show on firmware stuff I'd wear.

607
00:44:56,543 --> 00:44:57,228
Scott: I just talked about that.

608
00:44:57,268 --> 00:44:59,021
Scott: that guy got a Ferrari's got exactly I.

609
00:44:59,704 --> 00:45:01,291
Rym: but I think it's actually worth talking about.

610
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:03,159
Rym: like really what this means.

611
00:45:03,601 --> 00:45:12,506
Rym: Because there's a lot of issues around the concept of bricking and some of them edge into society issues some of them edge into capitalism issues some of them edge into.

612
00:45:12,948 --> 00:45:19,308
Rym: these are things you just need to know if you're gonna mess with your own technology like by so Mm-hmm.

613
00:45:19,328 --> 00:45:27,968
Scott: So I mean as a popular Undwell, and I'm sure there's probably some example of bricking that's way older than you Imagine right even though I can't think of it.

614
00:45:28,349 --> 00:45:33,687
Scott: but bricking is like a relatively new Phenomenon in like the greater.

615
00:45:33,707 --> 00:45:43,121
Rym: I don't know world it did rose Yeah, partly with the what once we went away from using just raw circuits Like.

616
00:45:43,141 --> 00:45:47,300
Rym: I'm trying not to use a bunch of electronics jargon here because I don't think all of you are super up on that.

617
00:45:47,360 --> 00:46:07,613
Rym: But there was an error where to use analog circuits and analog logic like logic gates like put a bunch of and or nan gates together on a breadboard along with a bunch of relays and mechanical devices and you would implement the logic of your thing like a furnace in Quote-unquote code but the code was this collection of wires.

618
00:46:08,134 --> 00:46:10,000
Scott: So yep, you can like a pinball machine.

619
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:13,873
Rym: Yeah, there's nothing like if you want to update it move the wires around.

620
00:46:14,094 --> 00:46:15,880
Rym: if the wires break replace them.

621
00:46:15,941 --> 00:46:17,239
Rym: You can look at the wires.

622
00:46:18,561 --> 00:46:21,780
Scott: There have always been cases of things being broken, right?

623
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,600
Scott: Broken things go way back.

624
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:27,119
Scott: In fact now things are probably less broken than they've ever been.

625
00:46:27,521 --> 00:46:30,533
Scott: Yeah things you used to need a lot more like TV repairmen.

626
00:46:30,573 --> 00:46:32,420
Scott: and so when's the last time you heard of a TV or impairment?

627
00:46:33,821 --> 00:46:42,660
Rym: Part of that is our disposable culture of if a TV breaks is cheaper to throw it away and buy a new one than it Is time it is and even look at it, of course, that is true as well.

628
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:45,500
Scott: But the point is things just break less often, right?

629
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:51,000
Scott: It's also it is that but it's also TVs used to break a lot and you'd need to get them repaired.

630
00:46:51,381 --> 00:46:52,886
Scott: when's the last time you had a broken TV?

631
00:46:52,987 --> 00:46:56,478
Rym: and also things have gotten cheaper and are more accessible to people.

632
00:46:56,779 --> 00:47:01,959
Rym: and The part that a lot of older people like to forget especially people who complain about the durability of modern things.

633
00:47:02,742 --> 00:47:04,728
Rym: Modern things do a lot more like.

634
00:47:05,089 --> 00:47:08,280
Rym: then old things did old furnaces old thermostats.

635
00:47:08,904 --> 00:47:10,699
Rym: There's like one fucking switch in there

636
00:47:11,994 --> 00:47:34,560
Scott: Yep But anyway, so the point is is that you know things have always broken right, you know human-made devices of any kind I've always broken but they could then be repaired in some way right because the device in and of itself and Common tools and common materials were all that you required to repair the device and make it work again

637
00:47:35,145 --> 00:47:36,959
Rym: In some cases a common knowledge.

638
00:47:37,862 --> 00:47:55,279
Scott: Yes today we have many devices out there and those devices include general-purpose CPUs right and not a general-purpose CPU like that's a very powerful one like the one in your desktop computer But you know like a very small 8-bit chip, you know something that's like you'd find it any s you can

639
00:47:55,299 --> 00:48:00,605
Rym: go CPU that runs it like a Few kilohertz and just does

640
00:48:00,866 --> 00:48:09,395
Scott: some sort of Motorola something something or Texas Instruments some chip or whatever that can run Tiny programs, you know, we're talking like, you know similar.

641
00:48:09,415 --> 00:48:10,540
Scott: It's like your Arduino, right?

642
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:12,920
Scott: It's something it won't be that exact architecture.

643
00:48:13,081 --> 00:48:21,289
Scott: But there's a lot a lot of micro processors in the world that you can buy if you're making products Right and just about every product has micro processors in them.

644
00:48:21,309 --> 00:48:28,705
Scott: Your car has probably arm CPUs in it right somewhere running different systems and Those systems have software.

645
00:48:28,986 --> 00:48:40,185
Scott: and if you have a desktop computer or even a phone then you have consumer tools That allow you into some level to some degree Modify that software.

646
00:48:40,225 --> 00:48:42,213
Scott: you can reinstall your OS on your computer.

647
00:48:42,293 --> 00:48:44,422
Scott: Even if you don't know how it can be done Yeah, any.

648
00:48:44,482 --> 00:48:48,060
Scott: so you can call someone to do it right and the software is available.

649
00:48:48,161 --> 00:48:51,059
Scott: You can get another computer and download that software, right?

650
00:48:52,301 --> 00:48:54,871
Scott: If you're I don't know, what's something else that has software?

651
00:48:54,911 --> 00:48:56,357
Scott: you're well, I can't know.

652
00:48:56,537 --> 00:49:02,240
Rym: a TV Has software like you can download an app onto it or like hit the factory reset button.

653
00:49:03,103 --> 00:49:07,640
Scott: Right, but a lot of devices out there that aren't just personal computers.

654
00:49:08,581 --> 00:49:10,088
Scott: Alright, say your refrigerator.

655
00:49:10,449 --> 00:49:11,855
Scott: Your refrigerator has software.

656
00:49:12,016 --> 00:49:13,040
Scott: It has CPUs in it.

657
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:16,380
Scott: Probably right if it's a fancy wine doesn't but it is not fancy.

658
00:49:17,164 --> 00:49:20,160
Scott: No, I'm saying there are fridges out there that do have CPUs, right?

659
00:49:21,204 --> 00:49:25,090
Scott: You know, maybe a better example HVAC are really good examples.

660
00:49:25,855 --> 00:49:26,580
Scott: No, that's a good one.

661
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:30,256
Scott: Yeah, but there's plenty of just devices you buy that have CPUs in them.

662
00:49:30,276 --> 00:49:31,160
Scott: They are computers.

663
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:40,189
Scott: They're computers inside and those computers are required for the device to function properly Sometimes required for it to function at all, right.

664
00:49:40,971 --> 00:49:43,920
Scott: or for the advanced features of the device to function.

665
00:49:44,041 --> 00:49:48,279
Scott: It might just work really stupidly if you don't have the computer parts working, right?

666
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:52,811
Scott: So you don't have access to that software at all.

667
00:49:52,952 --> 00:49:55,160
Scott: There's not like they give you a copy of the software.

668
00:49:56,101 --> 00:49:58,297
Scott: There's no interface on the device.

669
00:49:58,357 --> 00:50:00,847
Scott: That is Customer accessible.

670
00:50:01,329 --> 00:50:04,400
Scott: right for you to replace the software even if you did have the software.

671
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:07,391
Scott: It's not like there's an SD card slot and like a load from.

672
00:50:07,492 --> 00:50:21,133
Rym: I was about to use an example Metaphor that I realized is actually too old for our audience probably around the the extra buttons ABCD on a phone that a consumer phone does not have.

673
00:50:21,454 --> 00:50:28,600
Rym: but a telephone like a Telephone operations person a repair person has those extra buttons to do extra things on the phone network.

674
00:50:29,043 --> 00:50:31,480
Rym: But I don't think anyone knows about that anymore.

675
00:50:32,316 --> 00:50:56,559
Scott: Yeah People who work who produce electronics or make embedded computers or embedded devices There are certain computer interfaces that they use things like j-tag which like these debug interfaces Like if you're developing a circuit board You'll usually put like a j-tag connector on it and you'll connect your debug device, you know things to that and That way you can develop the circuit board.

676
00:50:56,881 --> 00:50:58,586
Scott: But then when you go into mass production.

677
00:50:58,947 --> 00:51:06,760
Scott: you either don't include that so there's no way to access those pins or You don't put the connector on or it's just hidden inside the vice.

678
00:51:07,101 --> 00:51:08,626
Scott: You don't know it's there as a customer.

679
00:51:08,646 --> 00:51:14,106
Scott: and even if you did know it's there as a customer and you found it and connected To it and were an expert.

680
00:51:14,467 --> 00:51:18,322
Scott: you don't have documentation for it necessarily and you know It'll it's not.

681
00:51:18,543 --> 00:51:24,240
Scott: it'll be very very difficult for you to actually, you know get any use out of you know the device.

682
00:51:24,301 --> 00:51:25,815
Scott: So if anything at

683
00:51:26,179 --> 00:51:26,280
Rym: all

684
00:51:26,681 --> 00:51:52,540
Scott: happens to the software in the device if the place the software is stored is broken if the software becomes corrupt if You're doing a firmware update through an official channel and it somehow stops halfway through it doesn't finish or it doesn't work properly If you know literally anything happens to that software You now have no way to repair that software because you don't have the bits Even if the hardware is in perfect condition.

685
00:51:53,721 --> 00:51:55,351
Scott: Condition hardware, there's.

686
00:51:55,432 --> 00:52:06,440
Rym: it's almost like it's a black box Like literally there is a black box that you cannot interact with in the device And if the failure is inside of that black box, there is no way for you to open that box, right?

687
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:09,760
Scott: It's like it's theoretically possible for you to fix it, right?

688
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,339
Scott: It's not inhumanly possible.

689
00:52:11,761 --> 00:52:17,240
Scott: But you do not have the information or the tools or the knowledge or whatever to actually do it.

690
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:21,440
Scott: The only people who could do it would be easily would be the people who made the device.

691
00:52:21,784 --> 00:52:27,841
Scott: They would be able to access You know and flash into a firmware on it and you could send it back to them to have them fix it or something Right.

692
00:52:28,162 --> 00:52:30,008
Rym: cars are a perfect example here.

693
00:52:30,069 --> 00:52:32,417
Rym: modern cars have chips in them that do a bunch of stuff.

694
00:52:32,838 --> 00:52:33,340
Rym: old cars.

695
00:52:33,642 --> 00:52:36,079
Rym: There was analog logic and mechanical logic there.

696
00:52:36,501 --> 00:52:42,300
Rym: So even if you didn't have specialized tools, you could physically mess with that logic if you had the knowledge.

697
00:52:42,783 --> 00:52:51,957
Rym: But even if you have the knowledge you're not connecting to your car's computer unless you're an ultra nerd and A lot of the software you can download from the internet that does that's full of malware.

698
00:52:51,978 --> 00:52:52,480
Rym: So watch out.

699
00:52:53,160 --> 00:53:00,160
Scott: Yeah, some people do figure out some of these interfaces especially on more popular devices and create tools or publish.

700
00:53:00,562 --> 00:53:04,339
Scott: You know black market or gray market ish or free ish.

701
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:12,360
Scott: You know somewhat trustworthy tools that can allow you to help fix or modify the software on devices sort of like how routers.

702
00:53:12,501 --> 00:53:13,913
Scott: You can flash your own firmware on them.

703
00:53:13,954 --> 00:53:19,175
Scott: But those are almost general-purpose real PCs with network cards and everything right.

704
00:53:19,195 --> 00:53:22,928
Scott: they have an interface that is That you can understand right?

705
00:53:23,009 --> 00:53:24,254
Scott: Sometimes they have SD cards.

706
00:53:24,656 --> 00:53:35,896
Rym: So luckily breaking like a device rarely gets bricked unless the user has taken some action or The device had an underlying fundamental problem.

707
00:53:35,936 --> 00:53:41,300
Scott: Like for example You might have us sometimes sometimes there's bad luck, but it's just rare, right?

708
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:42,967
Scott: It's like oh the the.

709
00:53:42,987 --> 00:53:44,754
Scott: there is a some flash memory chip.

710
00:53:45,035 --> 00:53:46,200
Scott: That's like 16 megabytes.

711
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:51,160
Scott: It has the OS on it and it got messed up and it's okay, right?

712
00:53:51,841 --> 00:53:52,665
Scott: It's still working.

713
00:53:52,966 --> 00:53:55,597
Scott: But because if it was actually broken, well, that would be broken.

714
00:53:55,637 --> 00:53:56,340
Scott: broken, right?

715
00:53:56,881 --> 00:54:01,239
Scott: But even if you replace that part, well, you don't you don't have the software to flash into it, right?

716
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:10,213
Rym: Yeah, it doesn't happen too often Like if my phone's like battery or like control like charging circuit broke and I just couldn't use it anymore I wouldn't say my phone was bricked.

717
00:54:10,253 --> 00:54:19,411
Rym: I'd say my phone broke Exactly, but if I was doing a firmware update on my phone and the phone just like crashed and then power button didn't do anything Anymore, that's a brick device.

718
00:54:19,431 --> 00:54:22,102
Rym: There's nothing wrong with that hardware Exactly.

719
00:54:22,242 --> 00:54:24,269
Scott: Somebody could repair it if they could flash it.

720
00:54:24,831 --> 00:54:27,500
Rym: so I would wager and I'm curious if you disagree.

721
00:54:27,821 --> 00:54:31,015
Rym: I think there are three things that cause the majority of all brickings.

722
00:54:31,357 --> 00:54:37,696
Rym: number one Power interruption during an update on a device that did not have proper protections built in.

723
00:54:37,836 --> 00:54:39,140
Scott: Yeah, that's that's pretty common.

724
00:54:39,562 --> 00:54:40,847
Scott: Number two, that's the cause.

725
00:54:40,888 --> 00:54:43,700
Scott: that's the cause of a lot of other problems as well like losing save files.

726
00:54:43,841 --> 00:54:47,820
Scott: I think maybe like lots and lots of data corruption is because of that exact problem.

727
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,626
Rym: Yeah, it's trivially solved.

728
00:54:49,667 --> 00:54:51,333
Rym: if you just make the device is more expensive.

729
00:54:51,373 --> 00:54:53,320
Rym: people just aren't willing to for a lot of reasons.

730
00:54:53,742 --> 00:54:54,666
Scott: Well, I think it's solved.

731
00:54:54,706 --> 00:55:03,578
Scott: actually Apple has a pretty good a lot and not only Apple But a lot of companies do this where the device will just refuse to do a firmware update if it's not plugged in.

732
00:55:03,799 --> 00:55:07,030
Rym: Yep My phone won't do it.

733
00:55:07,050 --> 00:55:09,720
Scott: You can't firmware update your Apple watch unless it's on the charger.

734
00:55:09,901 --> 00:55:15,722
Rym: Yeah, my phone will say something like it has to either be on the charger or the battery has to be above 90%.

735
00:55:15,722 --> 00:55:18,386
Scott: Yeah, the my gh5 Camera won't.

736
00:55:18,668 --> 00:55:23,658
Scott: if you put an SD card in with a firmware update It won't install it unless the battery is over like 90% or something.

737
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:24,321
Scott: The other

738
00:55:24,361 --> 00:55:40,595
Rym: thing to do that's common on more expensive devices is you have a second safe copy of the firmware embedded in the device in Non-rewritable memory that Can automatically bootstrap the system and replace whatever is in the broken memory, but that

739
00:55:40,916 --> 00:55:47,305
Scott: that's always a good fallback You know, it's like oh, yeah, it adds to cost but it is very nice when it's like, okay My device is totally messed up.

740
00:55:47,607 --> 00:55:50,880
Scott: I think the pebble watch I want to say had this it had something like that.

741
00:55:51,321 --> 00:56:00,356
Scott: It had something cuz I remember I messed it up once and I held some buttons and did a thing and it was restored To the way it was when I got it in the mail and I had to re-update it.

742
00:56:00,557 --> 00:56:01,420
Scott: That's what I remember.

743
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,166
Scott: I don't know that memory is.

744
00:56:03,567 --> 00:56:10,820
Rym: I have a similar memory where I had to do way more like there was a reset and then There was like a no do this thing tough fully fucking reset it.

745
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:12,980
Scott: You'll see this lot where it says like factory reset.

746
00:56:13,221 --> 00:56:17,685
Scott: Usually you can't do that if you're bricked because you have to access a menu A lot of times.

747
00:56:17,745 --> 00:56:21,620
Scott: factory reset just means reset all the settings back to the factory settings.

748
00:56:21,725 --> 00:56:35,336
Scott: Yeah sometimes devices do have a true factory reset whereby Pushing certain buttons and a hole in a certain configuration that you would never hit by accident Actually does load a known good firmware from way back and then you can try to update it.

749
00:56:35,377 --> 00:56:37,619
Scott: Yeah number two That's always nice to have.

750
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:38,221
Rym: Yeah I think.

751
00:56:38,261 --> 00:56:38,722
Rym: number two.

752
00:56:38,883 --> 00:56:44,839
Rym: the second most common reason is hacker was fucking around with their software or their hardware and they broke it.

753
00:56:45,662 --> 00:56:52,588
Scott: This is the one I call people out on all the time because it's listen if you want to mess with your stuff Um, that's cool, right?

754
00:56:52,628 --> 00:56:54,559
Scott: It's like that's all it's all about but eyes open.

755
00:56:54,599 --> 00:56:55,283
Rym: man Like do it?

756
00:56:55,343 --> 00:56:57,595
Scott: eyes you want to run you want to run doom on your calculator?

757
00:56:57,635 --> 00:56:58,420
Scott: That's sweet, right?

758
00:56:58,742 --> 00:57:07,024
Scott: The only time I Wag my finger is when I see people and I see there's a lot which really shocks me like I would understand.

759
00:57:07,064 --> 00:57:15,613
Scott: like if someone says man, I was having fun it trying to get doomed to run on my Toaster and I messed up and now my toaster won't toast.

760
00:57:16,536 --> 00:57:17,579
Scott: I really messed up guys.

761
00:57:17,619 --> 00:57:18,000
Scott: This sucks.

762
00:57:18,161 --> 00:57:21,440
Scott: I need to buy a new toaster now, but it's like alright that makes sense.

763
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:24,411
Scott: If someone says fuck this toaster company, right?

764
00:57:24,672 --> 00:57:25,154
Scott: I messed it.

765
00:57:25,535 --> 00:57:26,840
Scott: Why was it possible for me to mess?

766
00:57:26,941 --> 00:57:27,709
Scott: It's like you messed up.

767
00:57:27,749 --> 00:57:28,577
Scott: You told you did it.

768
00:57:29,701 --> 00:57:30,363
Scott: It's your fault.

769
00:57:30,383 --> 00:57:36,447
Rym: Yeah, like I've messed like I messed with the firmware on my old camera My gx1 because that camera is ancient.

770
00:57:36,487 --> 00:57:42,491
Rym: Like if I ruined it somehow not the end of the world Mm-hmm, of course, I didn't mess with.

771
00:57:42,511 --> 00:57:43,155
Rym: so my advice.

772
00:57:43,195 --> 00:57:43,980
Rym: what I want to do with it?

773
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:45,124
Rym: There's no firmware on earth.

774
00:57:45,144 --> 00:57:45,866
Rym: That'll make it do it.

775
00:57:45,987 --> 00:57:46,709
Scott: But right.

776
00:57:46,729 --> 00:57:58,280
Scott: Yeah, my advice though is just don't mess with a Device Software in an unofficial capacity, right unless you know what you're doing or willing for that device to be bricked.

777
00:57:58,320 --> 00:57:59,728
Rym: Yeah, that's okay with that's.

778
00:57:59,769 --> 00:58:00,654
Rym: the second part is important.

779
00:58:00,694 --> 00:58:08,745
Rym: as long as you Accept the risk that it might never work again, and there's nothing you can do about that Yeah, then it's totally cool.

780
00:58:08,785 --> 00:58:09,347
Scott: Just go for it.

781
00:58:09,608 --> 00:58:11,475
Rym: I bought that feel like I bought that ps1.

782
00:58:11,616 --> 00:58:13,525
Rym: I Opened it.

783
00:58:13,645 --> 00:58:15,355
Rym: I put I soldered a mod chip into it.

784
00:58:15,657 --> 00:58:17,807
Rym: There was a chance I was gonna ruin that ps1 forever.

785
00:58:18,168 --> 00:58:21,120
Rym: if I tried to return that ps1 would not have flown.

786
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:22,608
Rym: Because what'd you do?

787
00:58:22,628 --> 00:58:23,960
Scott: You're crying might have gotten away with it.

788
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:26,837
Rym: Oh, yeah, I would add to lie and like I don't know I open the box.

789
00:58:26,877 --> 00:58:27,280
Rym: It didn't work.

790
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:27,823
Scott: That's the thing.

791
00:58:27,843 --> 00:58:29,010
Scott: you that's the thing you would do.

792
00:58:29,090 --> 00:58:30,438
Rym: that is exactly what I would have done.

793
00:58:31,144 --> 00:58:41,076
Rym: I'll go right back to that Kmart and been like hey This ps1 didn't work and hope that by the time a human cracked it open and saw my bungled soldering attempt It was too late to track me down.

794
00:58:42,002 --> 00:58:50,013
Rym: Uh-huh, but there is a new OS to this one though because sometimes That bricking is because you're doing something that you shouldn't have done.

795
00:58:50,475 --> 00:58:52,220
Rym: that was dangerous and it broke the device.

796
00:58:52,501 --> 00:58:57,560
Rym: You cannot expect the company that made that device to protect you from your own tomfoolery, right?

797
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,846
Rym: but but Nintendo will do things to like.

798
00:59:02,086 --> 00:59:10,699
Rym: companies like Nintendo have a history of Trying to detect if you're running alternate firmware and brick you on purpose as a fuck you.

799
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:12,764
Scott: Yes, that's bullshit.

800
00:59:13,346 --> 00:59:18,080
Rym: I it's a similar situation, but I do do not believe that company should have the right.

801
00:59:18,442 --> 00:59:23,848
Rym: I think if you own hardware you could you can do whatever you want with it But it should be a two-way street in return.

802
00:59:24,209 --> 00:59:28,362
Rym: that company does not have to support you in any way Exactly.

803
00:59:28,543 --> 00:59:29,286
Scott: It's it's pretty simple.

804
00:59:29,347 --> 00:59:32,100
Scott: That's with you know, I think we have done an episode on right to repair.

805
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:36,520
Scott: Yeah, which is a which is actually a recurring topic that's come back a little bit recently.

806
00:59:36,641 --> 00:59:40,020
Scott: I think this is Massachusetts doing something right to repair.

807
00:59:40,281 --> 00:59:44,035
Rym: I feel like Massachusetts has been doing something a right to repair my entire adult life.

808
00:59:44,056 --> 00:59:47,451
Scott: I Think it might be on their voting this thing.

809
00:59:47,571 --> 00:59:49,259
Rym: I feel like that's happened before though.

810
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:52,951
Scott: Massachusetts right to repair something something.

811
00:59:53,152 --> 00:59:57,528
Scott: I can't believe I spelled Massachusetts, right, Massachusetts It's question one on their voting this year.

812
00:59:57,568 --> 01:00:00,798
Scott: right to repair law vehicle data access requirement initiative.

813
01:00:00,859 --> 01:00:01,039
Scott: Fuck.

814
01:00:01,079 --> 01:00:11,447
Scott: Yeah So we do research to figure out if yes or no is the right way to vote on question one, Massachusetts I'm not sure because I haven't read it But you obviously want to.

815
01:00:11,808 --> 01:00:14,620
Scott: you obviously want to vote in favor of the right to repair.

816
01:00:14,821 --> 01:00:27,500
Rym: I see some text of it and the text of the law says starting with model year 2022 the law would require Manufacturers of motor vehicles sold in the state to equip such vehicles that use any blah blah blah blah blah systems with access.

817
01:00:28,263 --> 01:00:30,049
Scott: So you want to make that law happen.

818
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:32,900
Scott: I assume voting yes is correct, but double-check read the whole thing.

819
01:00:33,143 --> 01:00:34,020
Rym: We don't live in Massachusetts.

820
01:00:35,782 --> 01:00:39,300
Rym: Yeah, I literally favor of the Springfield porno bill.

821
01:00:42,942 --> 01:00:44,929
Scott: Make sure you vote in favor of repairing right?

822
01:00:44,969 --> 01:00:46,976
Scott: So but that's the thing is companies.

823
01:00:47,136 --> 01:00:51,860
Scott: Apple right is Loosened up on this as they've been criticized, but they still have problems.

824
01:00:52,182 --> 01:00:54,886
Scott: John Deere is obviously always the number one Culprit that's.

825
01:00:54,947 --> 01:01:06,694
Scott: cars are a big one but cars are huge but in which basically the scam is that people make a device and because of the Possibility of bricking right and the secretness of the software.

826
01:01:06,935 --> 01:01:08,099
Scott: They're the only ones who have it.

827
01:01:09,384 --> 01:01:18,119
Scott: They can basically hold you hostage and force you to use their repair Services and not use any other repair services even when there's no reason for that, right?

828
01:01:19,343 --> 01:01:31,900
Rym: You know, there might be some legitimate reasons for you to only use certain repair service or there might be Some changes you could make to that software that are or should be illegal because cars use public infrastructure.

829
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:33,344
Scott: that's true also.

830
01:01:33,565 --> 01:01:37,055
Scott: or there are changes you could make to that.

831
01:01:37,095 --> 01:01:38,158
Scott: so that hardware.

832
01:01:38,459 --> 01:01:42,397
Scott: that would Damage the business model of the person selling the hardware.

833
01:01:42,457 --> 01:01:44,806
Rym: I don't care Business model dude.

834
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:46,754
Scott: Yeah, I could just load any old games.

835
01:01:46,834 --> 01:01:48,140
Scott: I want on my Nintendo switch.

836
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:49,766
Scott: It's now a play everything machine.

837
01:01:49,826 --> 01:01:53,900
Scott: It's got it, you know, every emulator known to man, but simultaneously you sold me hardware.

838
01:01:54,001 --> 01:01:55,429
Rym: I'm running software on that hardware.

839
01:01:55,449 --> 01:01:56,435
Rym: You don't get to say what I do.

840
01:01:56,455 --> 01:02:05,090
Rym: I think They're like car right to repair like any mechanic should be able to interface with any cars.

841
01:02:05,130 --> 01:02:16,534
Rym: electronics full stop, but There are definitely some things that an individual might do like making their car more performant but remove like reducing the emissions protections.

842
01:02:16,855 --> 01:02:22,039
Rym: that should be illegal and We got to figure out the line there which might come down to.

843
01:02:22,501 --> 01:02:32,272
Rym: When your car gets inspected and it's determined that you've turned off the emission control your car gets taken from you because you are Violating the contract of society independent.

844
01:02:32,312 --> 01:02:37,919
Scott: That's that's a separate problem is I think, you know Just the penalties for car infractions are way too low.

845
01:02:38,909 --> 01:02:51,320
Rym: Yep So general, I think not enforced Well, but anyway I think the number three thing that causes brickings is the one that I am the most mad about But I think it's a distant third for now, but I think it's gonna get worse and worse.

846
01:02:52,203 --> 01:02:56,507
Rym: Company has sold a device hardware like a speaker or something.

847
01:02:57,169 --> 01:03:06,958
Rym: company then wants to monetize said hardware in perpetuity and Forces like bricks the hardware if the licensing is not paid to continue using the software.

848
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:09,310
Scott: Oh That's similar to the right.

849
01:03:09,331 --> 01:03:10,860
Scott: Well, I guess that would be the fourth one, right?

850
01:03:11,201 --> 01:03:12,003
Scott: Yeah, is it?

851
01:03:12,244 --> 01:03:20,529
Scott: it's still some sort of DRM thing, right it's it's similar but yeah where the company basically There's a device that they sell a washing machine, right?

852
01:03:20,589 --> 01:03:30,083
Scott: Yeah, there is no once that washing machine is in place You know as long as you know for getting right to repair right assuming it works There's.

853
01:03:30,144 --> 01:03:32,497
Scott: you don't need the company that sold it to you anymore.

854
01:03:32,578 --> 01:03:32,920
Scott: I don't want to.

855
01:03:33,442 --> 01:03:34,706
Rym: I don't even need to write.

856
01:03:34,786 --> 01:03:37,355
Scott: I just wanted to keep doing what you you you pay them.

857
01:03:37,475 --> 01:03:41,848
Scott: once you don't have a washing machine It works it's gonna work forever until it breaks.

858
01:03:42,450 --> 01:03:50,468
Scott: by putting software in that washing machine they can artificially force Basically rent-seeking where it's like.

859
01:03:50,488 --> 01:03:54,004
Scott: well because we put software in the washing machine We can make your.

860
01:03:54,084 --> 01:03:57,658
Scott: it's like holding you hostage almost or blackmailing or extorting like.

861
01:03:57,778 --> 01:04:01,439
Rym: well It might be like you have to let us collect data about you or we brick you.

862
01:04:02,323 --> 01:04:17,580
Scott: right, it's like you have made you a washing machine, but we have software in there and Basically if you don't you know do what we say from now on and use your washing machine the way we want you to and Maybe buy a subscription service from us or who knows what right right?

863
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:21,672

866
01:04:31,390 --> 01:04:34,480
Scott: uh you want to use a battery from another third party, right?

867
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:36,026
Scott: We don't want to buy batteries from us.

868
01:04:36,668 --> 01:04:40,927
Scott: Oh you want to you know listen to music from a company We don't like you know.

Scott: We're gonna force you to you know stay with us.

873
01:04:46,761 --> 01:04:49,531
Scott: We're gonna sort of keep a stranglehold on you because you bought our product.

874
01:04:49,611 --> 01:04:51,980
Scott: obviously don't buy those products that are doing that.

875
01:04:53,961 --> 01:04:55,265
Rym: But also there should be a buy.

876
01:04:55,306 --> 01:05:01,744
Rym: you need some sort of rights of access and use like Those business models.

877
01:05:02,146 --> 01:05:05,978
Scott: those business rent-seeking business models like that should just be outlawed straight up.

878
01:05:06,499 --> 01:05:07,658
Rym: Yep You should be able to do it.

879
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:10,148
Rym: Well, actually we just need a very simple consumer protection.

880
01:05:10,188 --> 01:05:35,644
Rym: that if you sell hardware and obviously this is not the legal definition This is the colloquial definition if you sell a hardware it must come with the minimum necessary software to operate that hardware if software is necessary and You have a right in perpetuity to use that software or to write build or derive Equivalent software in the event that that software becomes unusable something like that

881
01:05:36,507 --> 01:05:44,399
Scott: and this and the company that makes the device is not allowed to You know remotely disable or hinder the device in any

882
01:05:44,419 --> 01:05:44,640
Rym: way.

883
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:52,140
Rym: They might not let you use their app and all like all their fancy stuff But they have to let you do what the hardware did with that minimum software right exactly?

884
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:56,480
Scott: So if you're offering for example the GoPro right there's a GoPro app you can get on your phone.

885
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:57,787
Scott: Yeah, and they they.

886
01:05:57,827 --> 01:06:00,280
Scott: but they make you get a stupid GoPro account, right?

887
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:05,300
Scott: You don't actually need the account but the account gives you access to like this cloud service, which is garbage.

888
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:06,204
Scott: You don't need that either.

889
01:06:06,586 --> 01:06:07,952
Scott: but it's like okay the cloud service.

890
01:06:07,972 --> 01:06:09,620
Scott: You're selling me some extra thing.

891
01:06:09,701 --> 01:06:12,160
Scott: I get you right, but you can get the firmware updates without paying.

892
01:06:13,463 --> 01:06:15,338
Scott: But imagine if they were like, alright, you know what?

893

Scott: Your GoPro isn't gonna even record videos anymore.

894

01:06:22,771 --> 01:06:25,059
Rym: You gotta pay five bucks to use the HDMI out.
