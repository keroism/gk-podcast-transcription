00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:13,849
Rym: It's Tuesday March 24th 2020 I'm Rym and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:13,909 --> 00:00:16,637
Rym: tonight We are reviewing two games that are new to us.

3
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:22,648
Rym: No return also known as as get kind zurich and square on sale.

4
00:00:24,693 --> 00:00:25,728
Rym: Let's do this.

5
00:00:28,854 --> 00:00:37,807
Rym: So if GeekNights sounds a little bit different that's because we are actually recording it remotely Which is something we've actually never done in the last 15 years like even one had to.

6
00:00:38,088 --> 00:00:42,190
Rym: we've never Done the show in any way except both of us sitting in a room.

7
00:00:42,611 --> 00:00:46,870
Rym: Scott lounging with his eyes closed me not looking at him at our microphones.

8
00:00:47,951 --> 00:00:49,638
Scott: Yeah, I mean why there was no reason to.

9
00:00:49,698 --> 00:00:52,550
Scott: we would just skip the show if we were apart for some reason.

10
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,438
Scott: Yeah, right apart from the audio equipment.

11
00:00:55,659 --> 00:00:57,805
Rym: Yep, but it's difficult times.

12
00:00:58,046 --> 00:01:03,569
Rym: and to reiterate While we would probably be safe meeting up Probably is not good enough right now.

13
00:01:04,434 --> 00:01:12,930
Rym: If we can stay home and set up this kind of fucky Janky pipeline to do the show remotely because we've never had to do it before you can stay home for a couple weeks.

14
00:01:13,911 --> 00:01:15,896
Scott: We'll see if it's a couple weeks or longer.

15
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:21,130
Scott: Yeah, you know if it's warm enough to bike biking might be an option.

16
00:01:21,351 --> 00:01:21,893
Rym: Oh my god.

17
00:01:21,953 --> 00:01:22,857
Rym: I just gotta get nice.

18
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:24,484
Scott: It's currently too cold.

19
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:25,629
Scott: So what I'd think?

20
00:01:25,649 --> 00:01:27,881
Rym: well It was warm in a very long walk.

21
00:01:28,143 --> 00:01:29,370
Rym: It was warm enough over the weekend.

22
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:31,000
Rym: There was that one day where it was like.

23
00:01:31,302 --> 00:01:36,979
Scott: I know it wasn't even a day It was like an afternoon and I basically as soon as it was warm I biked and then it got cold.

24
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:38,669
Scott: they came back I came home and that was it.

25
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,219
Scott: There was the end of the warm period.

26
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:46,418
Rym: as soon as it got warm me and Emily was like, yeah And we ran outside and we went for a run and we came back and then the next day It was like 40 and raining.

27
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,449
Scott: It was like four hour period of warmth.

28
00:01:49,251 --> 00:01:50,300
Rym: Yesterday was totally told.

29
00:01:50,321 --> 00:01:53,949
Scott: the Sun went down And I don't think I went outside yesterday.

30
00:01:54,671 --> 00:01:55,313
Rym: Uh, did I?

31
00:01:55,473 --> 00:02:00,430
Rym: I did go outside once to drop off a growler at the Baroness and get a new refilled growler.

32
00:02:01,315 --> 00:02:02,389
Scott: Oh, they just give you the whole thing.

33
00:02:02,951 --> 00:02:11,926
Rym: So what they're doing is they are basically they're doing takeout food only but they will give you beer and food And that is totally okay for a bunch of arcane reasons.

34
00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:15,659
Scott: Oh, yeah I mean you can even get beer delivered from a bodega.

35
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:19,370
Scott: Yeah, you know beer delivery is totally legal and always has been in New York.

36
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:23,370
Rym: So if you're not familiar growler, basically, it's just a milk jug that you completely fill with beer.

37
00:02:24,332 --> 00:02:25,561
Rym: Yeah, it's about that size.

38
00:02:25,702 --> 00:02:26,649
Rym: It's like a gallon of beer.

39
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:32,744
Rym: So we're gonna get a couple of those a week and Hopefully that will help keep the Baroness in business because I love that.

40
00:02:32,764 --> 00:02:34,069
Scott: I don't think they're gonna be going out of it.

41
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:35,570
Rym: Yep, it's cool though.

42
00:02:35,731 --> 00:02:46,262
Rym: They basically got two employees in there and like we've known the guy for a long time because we've been going there forever and he's Super chill but because it's so empty and quiet I've got to talk to him a lot more and he's even cooler than I thought.

43
00:02:46,744 --> 00:02:48,050
Rym: he's like he lives nearby.

44
00:02:48,412 --> 00:02:50,869
Rym: He's driving to the Baroness for maximum safety.

45
00:02:51,251 --> 00:02:54,506
Rym: He had like they said of all these protocols of like how people sure you just walk there.

46
00:02:54,546 --> 00:02:57,724
Rym: if he lives nearby Well, he lives like 20 minutes away vice.

47
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:02,002
Rym: Oh, that's not nearby It's nearby compared to like living in Brooklyn.

48
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:10,387
Rym: Yeah Anyway, anyway, so in some meta news, uh Scott always like to point out that I like.

49
00:03:11,028 --> 00:03:11,590
Rym: I like noises.

50
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:12,776
Rym: I mean I used to be a musician.

51
00:03:12,816 --> 00:03:13,760
Rym: I'm still kind of a musician.

52
00:03:13,781 --> 00:03:17,414
Rym: I've been playing my trumpet again, but So it's Rym's thing is.

53
00:03:17,454 --> 00:03:21,650
Scott: all he does is he you know, he makes yeah, he makes annoying noises.

54
00:03:21,872 --> 00:03:24,273
Scott: There's a device that makes annoying noises He wants.

55
00:03:24,293 --> 00:03:27,685
Scott: he finds out that a particular noise and noise you he'll make that noise.

56
00:03:27,745 --> 00:03:29,010
Scott: go out of his way to make that noise.

57
00:03:29,211 --> 00:03:29,933
Scott: It's possible.

58
00:03:30,074 --> 00:03:40,950
Rym: but one of the things that a musical instrument that I've always loved is the hurdy-gurdy Which is basically a violin where you don't need to bow or finger because those are the two things I cannot do.

59
00:03:41,191 --> 00:03:45,230
Rym: I am I am like preternaturally unable to play stringed instruments.

60
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:49,630
Rym: But the hurdy-gurdy removes all of the challenges that I would have with a stringed instrument.

61
00:03:50,051 --> 00:03:50,493
Rym: It's basically.

62
00:03:50,553 --> 00:03:54,947
Scott: it also removes it sort, you know, the you know, the the finesse, right?

63
00:03:55,028 --> 00:03:56,372
Scott: Oh, yeah exactly It's a.

64
00:03:56,733 --> 00:03:59,822
Rym: it is definitely a a thick fingered instrument.

65
00:04:00,123 --> 00:04:07,887
Rym: It's the keytar equivalent of a violin exactly, but it's more like bagpipes of all things because it drones.

66
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:13,277
Rym: so it's Some people may like this, but it's not air-powered Yeah, but it's still drones.

67
00:04:13,317 --> 00:04:13,437
Rym: Like.

68
00:04:13,457 --> 00:04:15,165
Rym: it'll basically play like crank.

69
00:04:15,225 --> 00:04:16,250
Scott: I thought you had to crank it up.

70
00:04:17,154 --> 00:04:24,990
Rym: You crank it constantly and a wheel spins past the Strings so you can basically just play infinite notes.

71
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:30,852
Rym: They usually have one of the strings just going wah the whole time and then you play notes on the other string Mm-hmm.

72
00:04:31,253 --> 00:04:36,289
Rym: So I bought a mechanical kit to make my own hurdy-gurdy and I'm a big is it?

73
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:39,482
Rym: Oh, it's like a foot and a half tall when I finish.

74
00:04:39,682 --> 00:04:41,389
Scott: Okay, so it's not like cello sized.

75
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:43,396
Rym: No No, they're like violin sized time.

76
00:04:43,497 --> 00:04:44,480
Rym: Okay, or even smaller.

77
00:04:44,902 --> 00:04:46,146
Rym: Maybe this is more like a banjo.

78
00:04:46,187 --> 00:04:48,035
Rym: the way I was looking at it Mm-hmm.

79
00:04:48,299 --> 00:04:49,049
Rym: We'll see how it sounds.

80
00:04:49,531 --> 00:04:55,368
Rym: I doubt it'll sound great because it doesn't have like a resonating chamber like a like a well-made wooden instrument would have.

81
00:04:55,749 --> 00:05:04,470
Rym: but This will be a good way to find out if I actually want to play a hurdy-gurdy for real because if I do I'll just like helps get someone to make me a real hurdy-gurdy and I can pass my trumpet.

82
00:05:05,112 --> 00:05:12,301
Scott: The best homemade instrument you can possibly make is the cigar box guitar slash banjo Cigar box.

83
00:05:12,362 --> 00:05:17,622
Scott: you put a stick on it You put a cup a string or a few You know and the effort to make one is low.

84
00:05:17,843 --> 00:05:20,553
Scott: the style is pretty high Relative to the effort.

85
00:05:20,593 --> 00:05:22,820
Scott: the sound is pretty high relative to the effort.

86
00:05:23,221 --> 00:05:26,070
Scott: the ease of playing versus results is pretty high.

87
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:29,223
Scott: It's just like, you know, it's not like a terrific amazing instrument.

88
00:05:29,243 --> 00:05:31,869
Scott: It's just the ratio of ease.

89
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:33,556
Scott: You made it yourself.

90
00:05:33,637 --> 00:05:36,950
Scott: It looks cool and it sounds kind of good is really high ratio.

91
00:05:37,451 --> 00:05:41,506
Rym: So in terms of the ratio of effort to learn versus sounds pretty good.

92
00:05:41,546 --> 00:05:44,274
Scott: harmonica still wins Mmm, I don't know.

93
00:05:44,294 --> 00:05:50,618
Scott: I think cigar box guitar or even ukulele is probably easier than Harmonica, I don't know.

94
00:05:50,679 --> 00:05:52,110
Scott: I don't need to learn any mouth skills.

95
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:54,310
Scott: Anyone with hands already has hand skills.

96
00:05:54,611 --> 00:05:58,930
Rym: I had the mouth skills to play basic harmonica stuff round down to basically zero if all you're gonna play.

97
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,406
Scott: But a lot of people don't have any mouth skills at all.

98
00:06:01,849 --> 00:06:06,790
Scott: true It's like you have to at least learn some kind of embouchure if you everyone knows how to use the fucking hands.

99
00:06:07,052 --> 00:06:14,610
Rym: True that is way back when both of us were learning the harmonica I had an unfair advantage because of the trumpet and like my tonguing skills you had to learn extra skills from scratch.

100
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,713
Scott: I played clarinet.

101
00:06:15,753 --> 00:06:16,656
Scott: I have mouth skills.

102
00:06:16,736 --> 00:06:19,985
Scott: I just you know, I think that barely requires an embouchure.

103
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:33,686
Rym: I do not have any Discipline To continue and repeatedly practice something to mastery, but I will link to this kit because uh The people who make it it's on a player.

104
00:06:33,908 --> 00:06:46,623
Rym: Uh, yeah Parality comm they make like Woodcraft things and they have a lot of really cool stuff there and they're putting a lot of their stuff on sale Because a lot of people are stuck at home like bored looking for projects.

105
00:06:47,445 --> 00:06:47,626
Scott: Mm-hmm.

106
00:06:48,188 --> 00:06:48,790
Rym: So you got any news?

107
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:50,260
Scott: I do have a news.

108
00:06:50,341 --> 00:06:55,082
Scott: It's sort of a Small news because the news is actually tomorrow.

109
00:06:55,142 --> 00:06:56,408
Scott: We're recording this on March 24th.

110
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:01,290
Scott: You're probably listening on March 25th, which is when the news will actually happen.

111
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:09,530
Scott: So it's a. it's a news announcing a news, but Sega has teased for the 60th anniversary of Sega.

112
00:07:11,053 --> 00:07:12,810
Scott: Some sort of announcement tomorrow.

113
00:07:13,493 --> 00:07:18,856
Scott: But if you look at the single teaser image that they have released Right, all the all it's.

114
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:21,906
Scott: the only text they've released is ah, so you've come to this page.

115
00:07:21,966 --> 00:07:23,130
Scott: You must really like Sega.

116
00:07:23,552 --> 00:07:25,723
Scott: Please wait a little longer until the site is open.

117
00:07:25,803 --> 00:07:27,109
Scott: So I guess the site will open tomorrow.

118
00:07:28,473 --> 00:07:39,469
Scott: But the image in the teaser appears to be Sega satan Shiro what which is huge news for anyone who knows who that is.

119
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:45,996
Rym: we were vaguely obsessed with him for a while at RIT because One there wasn't YouTube yet.

120
00:07:46,177 --> 00:07:52,270
Rym: So finally having one of these videos was already pretty novel and two He's just an amazing character.

121
00:07:53,934 --> 00:07:59,560
Scott: So if anyone who doesn't know when the Sega Saturn was a thing It was a bigger thing in Japan than the u.s.

122
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,549
Scott: Where it kind of flopped mostly, right?

123
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,613
Scott: the Advertisements for it.

124
00:08:04,814 --> 00:08:14,929
Scott: the Sega Saturn in Japan involved a character named segata San Shiro, which when you say it quickly sort of sounds like Sega Saturn Shiro.

125
00:08:16,036 --> 00:08:21,254
Scott: right Say Exactly Right, exactly.

126
00:08:21,415 --> 00:08:23,483
Scott: I think they received a set of commercials.

127
00:08:23,523 --> 00:08:25,110
Scott: You can watch all the commercials on YouTube.

128
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,376
Scott: I'm sure they're they're all around and very popular.

129
00:08:27,396 --> 00:08:30,083
Scott: and the final commercial he died spoilers.

130
00:08:30,364 --> 00:08:32,549
Rym: Yep, but he dives saving Sega.

131
00:08:33,273 --> 00:08:39,109
Scott: Yeah season it was but the commercials are just an amazing character advertising the product in an amazing way.

132
00:08:40,371 --> 00:08:48,570
Scott: and you just you know, you you know when in the US knew about this character until You know internet came around and we were able to see Japanese commercials.

133
00:08:49,052 --> 00:08:52,765
Rym: I remember an early ConnectiCon someone was cosplaying as this.

134
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:53,186
Rym: I got it.

135
00:08:53,246 --> 00:08:56,927
Scott: I got the picture somewhere I gotta find yes, but by that I already knew who it was at that point.

136
00:08:56,967 --> 00:08:59,093
Scott: Yeah, right I saw.

137
00:08:59,133 --> 00:09:02,750
Scott: I think at the first time it was like some someone at RIT was like have you heard of Sega?

138
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:14,370
Scott: Sanjiro Sega, it's like oh here it is I. Anyway, so yes, they get so Sanjiro may be coming back or maybe his son or something or descendant or who knows?

139
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,982
Scott: We'll find out by the time you're hearing this podcast problem.

140
00:09:18,002 --> 00:09:20,150
Scott: Yeah, if not a few hours afterwards.

141
00:09:20,912 --> 00:09:27,470
Rym: So in some other relatively minor news, uh half-life Alex is imminently arriving for people who have VR.

00:09:45,963 --> 00:09:46,163
Scott: Yep.

151
00:09:46,745 --> 00:09:48,270
Rym: So I've seen some early reviews.

152
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:50,695
Rym: I plan to play it Probably this weekend.

153
00:09:50,715 --> 00:10:01,272
Rym: I'm going to try to play the whole thing through but it Appears based on the early reviews I've seen but I have not played it yet that it is definitely one of those of the VR That's out.

154
00:10:01,372 --> 00:10:06,650
Rym: Not only is a peak experience, but it might be one of the best VR experiences possible.

155
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:09,150
Scott: We're I mean the important the impression that I've got.

156
00:10:09,431 --> 00:10:14,209
Scott: Yeah, the impression that I've gotten is that yeah, every other VR thing is pooped.

157
00:10:14,249 --> 00:10:29,270
Scott: now This is like, you know much the way because like half-life 1 sort of set the bar, right and then half-life 2 Sort of also set the bar kinda it for you know, just in other ways, right but like VR is still pretty early technology.

158
00:10:29,451 --> 00:10:34,050
Rym: So like a lot of games have set the bar so far, but the bar is still relatively low.

159
00:10:34,632 --> 00:10:44,560
Scott: But valve, you know and basically announced like hey the reason we haven't released a half-life 3 We've made several of them is because none of them were good enough Like they refused to release a half-life.

160
00:10:44,661 --> 00:10:52,948
Scott: unless it sets a new bar And half-life Alex appears as if it might for you know, VR games be setting the new bar.

161
00:10:52,968 --> 00:10:54,973
Rym: So, there you go I will play it this weekend to see.

162
00:10:55,093 --> 00:11:06,110
Rym: but the VR game I've been playing lately is Currently one of the things that has set a bar because super hot was super great but pistol-width is Amazing what it is.

163
00:11:06,211 --> 00:11:12,720
Rym: It's a rail shooter Which is a perfect kind of game to make in VR because you can avoid a lot of the motion sickness problems.

164
00:11:13,062 --> 00:11:14,008
Scott: So it's time crisis.

165
00:11:14,148 --> 00:11:16,100
Rym: Okay, but it's it's John wick.

166
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:20,620
Rym: You're basically just walking forward at a constant rate and enemies pop up everywhere and you got to shoot him.

167
00:11:21,422 --> 00:11:25,735
Rym: But the thing that makes it great is that it's actually not really a shooter.

168
00:11:26,236 --> 00:11:27,340
Rym: It's a rhythm game.

169
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,646
Scott: There's games like that.

170
00:11:30,707 --> 00:11:39,480
Rym: Yeah, there's pumping music and in this 3d VR world with a lot of abstract like imagery and abstract shapes and all this fun stuff.

171
00:11:39,721 --> 00:11:44,340
Rym: You're just doing this rhythm shooter and it feels like the scene in John wick one.

172
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,485
Rym: We're just walking through murdering Russian mobsters one by one in the nightclub.

173
00:11:47,925 --> 00:11:51,130
Rym: It basically feels like that constantly and it's crazy fun.

174
00:11:52,322 --> 00:11:53,106
Scott: And also isn't that what?

175
00:11:53,287 --> 00:11:53,548
Scott: isn't that?

176
00:11:53,568 --> 00:11:54,654
Scott: what time crisis feels like?

177
00:11:55,035 --> 00:11:58,207
Rym: Oh, yeah, but time crisis It doesn't have the like the heavy rhythm element.

178
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:02,000
Scott: I guess that's true, but I have seen a rhythm shooters before.

179
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:04,760
Scott: Oh, yeah, but I think this area is a various mechanism.

180
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,564
Rym: This is blended.

181
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:07,331
Rym: this a lot of what super hot did.

182
00:12:07,372 --> 00:12:11,788
Rym: Well what I mean isn't What Tokyo 911 does.

183
00:12:11,848 --> 00:12:13,054
Rym: well the game that we used to know.

184
00:12:13,074 --> 00:12:17,890
Scott: No, I mean there's already The the blade one beat saver, right?

185
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:18,432
Scott: There's already.

186
00:12:18,532 --> 00:12:19,315
Rym: that's not a shooter.

187
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:19,958
Rym: That's just a rhythm.

188
00:12:19,978 --> 00:12:21,544
Scott: It's a sorter It's a rhythm sword.

189
00:12:21,564 --> 00:12:22,830
Scott: Yes, and now you have a rhythm gunner.

190
00:12:22,971 --> 00:12:25,784
Rym: Yep, but the rhythm gun saver with gun There aren't.

191
00:12:25,964 --> 00:12:29,600
Rym: I have not seen a game that has combined all of these three things together.

192
00:12:29,962 --> 00:12:37,907
Scott: so wasn't there the one that used at the Omega thon the the Harmonics one that was like a rhythm gunner.

193
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:39,233
Rym: Oh, yeah.

194
00:12:39,273 --> 00:12:46,204
Rym: Yeah that that does a lot of these feelings But it doesn't also have the Tokyo 911 feeling Hmm.

195
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:49,300
Scott: Yeah, I guess visually that was just a bunch of colors and lights and things.

196
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,740
Scott: Yeah, like a rhythm game that purely whereas this one this one is a rhythm game.

197
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,227
Scott: But the visuals are actually a time crisis.

198
00:12:56,267 --> 00:13:03,420
Rym: visual yep, and dodging it feels exactly like it feels in that police 9-1-1 Whatever that we always played in Wildwood you and your police.

199
00:13:03,481 --> 00:13:04,680
Scott: No, no that gives great.

200
00:13:04,941 --> 00:13:16,138
Rym: And I got really good at it because it was as the arcades in a Wildwood got worse and worse and worse that one game Was still there way late to the party it was still just hanging out it barely worked And that was the only game I would play eventually.

201
00:13:21,103 --> 00:13:24,900
Rym: anyway, I guess it's time for things of the day.

202
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:30,170
Rym: You you've talked up your thing in the day and now that I'm looking at it I see why I've seen this comic before.

203
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,497
Scott: oh you have seen it before.

204
00:13:31,517 --> 00:13:42,392
Scott: yeah I have not seen it before at least not before yesterday, so Apparently there is this Hungarian comic strip, and I don't know if how you you know the.

205
00:13:42,612 --> 00:13:45,340
Scott: the alphabet of the Hungarian language looks you car.

206
00:13:45,882 --> 00:13:50,360
Scott: Yeah, looks somewhere between English and Cyrillic, so I don't know how to pronounce the words.

207
00:13:50,481 --> 00:13:53,860
Scott: I'll just so sorry anyone who knows how to read Hungarian.

208
00:13:54,383 --> 00:14:00,887
Scott: I assume that that the name of the character and the name of the comic is Drusika which is similar like the equivalent of Jessica.

209
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:09,708
Scott: right hmm, but anyway, so this deal with this comic is it was created by Somebody named.

210
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:10,450
Scott: what was their name?

211
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:29,873
Scott: Hold on the creator's name is Poots I Paul which probably pronouncing that wrong also And it was published in some sort of publications magazines or newspapers in Hungary between the 50s and the 70s.

212
00:14:29,913 --> 00:14:31,998
Scott: so it had like a good like 20-year run.

213
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:40,618
Scott: basically And even though it's Hungarian you can read these comics because there's very little dialogue in them.

214
00:14:40,658 --> 00:14:42,727
Scott: basically none It's almost all.

215
00:14:42,787 --> 00:14:44,777
Scott: the gags are entirely visual.

216
00:14:44,857 --> 00:14:52,968
Scott: occasionally They'll be like a sign with something written on it And each comic will have like a title like Jessica dresses the shop's window.

217
00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:56,159
Scott: Jessica is hiking Jessica in rush-hour traffic, right?

218
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:01,055
Scott: And there's two different Twitter accounts that are posting comics from this.

219
00:15:01,256 --> 00:15:07,806
Scott: one of them is Jessica Daily and one of them is Jessica in order In order.

220
00:15:08,047 --> 00:15:17,120
Scott: one is publishing them in order duh Instead of just random selections is posting them one a day and is posting translations and contextual info.

221
00:15:17,682 --> 00:15:24,385
Scott: So I recommend the in order one over the other one mm-hmm But it's actually somewhat fascinating.

222
00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:39,940
Scott: I looked into how this comic became a thing in the u.s.. It's actually a 4chan deal Apparently Someone on 4chan because basically the idea of the comic is is it the main character is this woman Jessica Jessica?

223
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:49,740
Scott: Whatever and each three panel comic like she's up to shenanigans and the shenanigans are usually sexy in nature But not always yep, but they're not over the line.

224
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,263
Rym: They're just like.

225
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,510
Rym: I don't know they.

226
00:15:51,611 --> 00:15:53,099
Rym: I get a tiny almost eraser.

227
00:15:53,381 --> 00:15:56,718
Rym: It's her kind of vibe like she's very lum ask in the way she interacts with people.

228
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:57,120
Scott: right.

229
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:02,256
Scott: It's weird cuz sometimes you know for something made from the 50s to the 70s in a communist Hungary right.

230
00:16:02,638 --> 00:16:17,053
Scott: sometimes It's sort of male gaze II obviously right which isn't so great, but a lot of times It's actually sort of like a feminist satire like Or you know sexually empowering in different ways right like the

231
00:16:17,093 --> 00:16:22,229
Rym: one where the guy is like being a little too Handsy at the dance and she she gets him.

232
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:25,880
Scott: yeah, there's ones where this guys are too handsy and she like you know hurts them

233
00:16:26,661 --> 00:16:26,903
Rym: Right,

234
00:16:27,245 --> 00:16:42,914
Scott: but there's also ones were like she's into a dude, and she's like hey Right like there's one where she's dancing at like a costume party, and she's wearing like she's dressed like a you know French Aristocracy from 1800s big big dress and the dude she's dancing with.

235
00:16:43,295 --> 00:16:44,339
Scott: you know who looks like King herp.

236
00:16:44,359 --> 00:16:46,989
Scott: the derp Can't get close enough, and they're dancing awkwardly.

237
00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:53,636
Scott: so she sort of sneaks out of the dress And then she's dancing in like her underwear yeah, and it's sort of like hey.

238
00:16:53,656 --> 00:16:54,439
Scott: Yeah, what if?

239
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,685
Scott: But yeah, you know not all the comics are sexy though There's some that are just like.

240
00:16:58,705 --> 00:17:09,140
Scott: this is one here where an old lady loses a bird so she climbs up the tree with a cage to go get the bird and She gives the old lady a cat and the joke is the cat ate the bird

241
00:17:11,861 --> 00:17:15,577
Rym: She's afraid of the mouse and she jumps into the arms of a much more dangerous animal.

242
00:17:15,597 --> 00:17:19,807
Scott: yeah So you know and also glad you know.

243
00:17:19,827 --> 00:17:24,651
Scott: the other thing that's great about this comic is just the art style and aesthetic of it Is crazy good?

244
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,582
Scott: right It's?

245
00:17:28,622 --> 00:17:37,156
Scott: you know it gives me some Katie Skelly vibes going on, but you know overall I'm just way into it, so I recommend following this Twitter account.

246
00:17:37,236 --> 00:17:50,829
Scott: reading this comic And you know it makes me want to learn more about other You know comic strips from other countries that you know because it's not like there's that many new Newspaper comic strips.

247
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,398
Scott: right they're all webcomics now.

248
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:57,620
Scott: And I already do know a lot of webcomics from other countries to some extent right.

249
00:17:58,383 --> 00:18:04,907
Scott: But I don't know a lot about the old newspaper comics from other countries that didn't become world's Popular.

250
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:26,974
Scott: yeah You know ones that were in smaller publications or at smaller runs or were never republished or licensed in other languages or anything like that, so Yeah, whoever found this and made it a thing late last year Thanks, and now everyone can enjoy it and you can see the follower counts on the Twitter accounts.

251
00:18:27,175 --> 00:18:33,280
Scott: the follower cats on the turn For these comics are increasing dramatically recently.

252
00:18:34,682 --> 00:18:35,406
Scott: Get in on the.

253
00:18:35,767 --> 00:18:37,275
Scott: get in on it, so I'm gonna cheat.

254
00:18:37,355 --> 00:18:40,531
Rym: I am linking to a channel I have linked to once before a while back.

255
00:18:40,551 --> 00:18:41,576
Rym: technology actions.

256
00:18:41,777 --> 00:18:44,458
Scott: well But I'll fail on you.

257
00:18:45,062 --> 00:18:45,423
Rym: I like.

258
00:18:45,443 --> 00:19:03,580
Rym: this video is pretty good because one of the things that I really am fascinated by our Electro mechanical devices like old pre like pre modern integrated circuit arcade machines things like that Like a pinball machine yeah, but this one is a fancy complicated jukebox with song selection.

259
00:19:04,641 --> 00:19:09,620
Rym: Okay, complicated song selection, and it's not a teardown of like the entire jukebox.

260
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,446
Rym: So you did make some videos for all that too.

261
00:19:12,048 --> 00:19:18,654
Rym: It's a deep like half-hour long explanation of one specific part of the jukebox and it is a

262
00:19:18,834 --> 00:19:19,557
Scott: relay

263
00:19:19,718 --> 00:19:38,840
Rym: driven accumulator like an old-fashioned accumulator because In the era before I sees like if you wanted to put logic into something You there were design patterns to do that kind of thing and an accumulator is actually one of the like Core electronic components that you could use to build complex machinery

264
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:39,762
Scott: Mm-hmm

265
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:44,869
Rym: like you know if you ever learn how to make circuits like you learn about adders And you learn about making Nand gates and stuff.

266
00:19:44,889 --> 00:19:46,296
Scott: Yeah, I have a computer science degree.

267
00:19:46,336 --> 00:19:46,738
Scott: I learned that.

268
00:19:46,959 --> 00:19:50,052
Rym: yep I was supposed to have learned that yep, but I don't think a lot of people have.

269
00:19:50,112 --> 00:20:05,407
Rym: so if you want to see a Reasonably complex electromechanical accumulator that relies not just on circuits and Relays, but also on big heavy metal pins and springs that are holding them under tension This thing's actually pretty amazing.

270
00:20:05,849 --> 00:20:12,635
Scott: how a lot of the problem with a lot of those things though is like you know You know pinball machines right there always breaking and you have to keep fixing them right.

271
00:20:12,656 --> 00:20:13,358
Scott: so how often it?

272
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,788
Scott: How reliable is this jukebox before super reliable?

273
00:20:16,828 --> 00:20:21,100
Rym: the machine actually is working and fully restored except for the coin?

274
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:22,426
Rym: collection mechanism.

275
00:20:22,868 --> 00:20:25,320
Rym: no one can figure out how to make it work, haha.

276
00:20:26,203 --> 00:20:34,874
Rym: So all they did and the crazy thing is the way it works is there's a solenoid inside that when it's powered Pulls a bunch of levers and activates like a million circuits everywhere like.

277
00:20:34,914 --> 00:20:36,720
Rym: that's basically the equivalent of copy protection.

278
00:20:37,442 --> 00:20:42,380
Rym: They can't figure out how to make that solenoid be triggered by the coin accumulator.

279
00:20:42,661 --> 00:20:51,387
Rym: So instead they just hard-coded it to always be powered if the machine is plugged in What it's basically an always play mode Mmm in the meta moment.

280
00:20:51,788 --> 00:20:54,660
Rym: and like I said we're recording the show a weird way.

281
00:20:54,861 --> 00:20:58,040
Rym: So it might sound a little bit different and we're gonna have to tweak this process as we go on.

282
00:20:59,322 --> 00:21:01,320
Rym: But otherwise I think we can do the show like this just fine.

283
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,999
Rym: I'll make some tweaks and by next week you probably won't even notice the difference.

284
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:09,720
Rym: Maybe otherwise the booklet book remains the tale of Genji not the tale of Ozo.

285
00:21:10,421 --> 00:21:11,785
Scott: We'll see if we can do some reading.

286
00:21:11,825 --> 00:21:12,467
Scott: have you been reading?

287
00:21:12,487 --> 00:21:16,260
Rym: I have not because I've been playing the original xcom.

288
00:21:17,181 --> 00:21:18,488
Scott: Yeah, it's like because I'm at home.

289
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:18,911
Scott: I don't have.

290
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:20,620
Scott: I'm doing all this other stuff instead.

291
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,694
Scott: It's like I got all this extra time of the day.

292
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:25,067
Scott: I don't need to Read on the right way.

293
00:21:25,349 --> 00:21:31,859
Rym: I'm playing original xcom tonight I'll be starting to play some Animal Crossing and I'm also gonna be building my hurdy-gurdy pretty soon.

294
00:21:32,362 --> 00:21:33,309
Scott: I'm playing.

295
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:40,180
Scott: I'm playing the new doom eternal Got a little bit of Zelda randomizer and I might play some Animal Crossing.

296
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:40,722
Scott: We'll see.

297
00:21:40,742 --> 00:21:41,404
Scott: it's.

298
00:21:41,605 --> 00:21:43,371
Scott: you know, the $60 is the main thing.

299
00:21:43,391 --> 00:21:44,836
Scott: I mean it was less than that.

300
00:21:44,877 --> 00:21:45,358
Scott: I would play it.

301
00:21:45,398 --> 00:21:49,195
Rym: No question That's why I got it physical because I can always sell it to someone later or give it away.

302
00:21:49,215 --> 00:21:51,305
Scott: and I figured yeah I don't really like doing it.

303
00:21:51,405 --> 00:21:51,706
Scott: Whatever.

304
00:21:51,726 --> 00:21:53,012
Rym: Yeah, but I figured I've never.

305
00:21:53,132 --> 00:22:06,508
Rym: I've never been on an Animal Crossing train and while I have an idea of what the game is like I don't really know because I've never played it and I've never really seen anything about it except memes and Screenshots and other people who are into it talking about it.

306
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:08,655
Scott: It's literally just walk around and do stuff.

307
00:22:08,956 --> 00:22:11,726
Rym: Yeah, so I'm gonna play it I'm gonna mooch around and see what the deal is.

308
00:22:12,389 --> 00:22:14,055
Scott: All right, maybe I'll play it.

309
00:22:14,075 --> 00:22:14,397
Scott: We'll see.

310
00:22:14,598 --> 00:22:20,020
Rym: Yeah, we'll see But otherwise, obviously we are not attending any conventions for the foreseeable future.

311
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:26,900
Rym: The nope most likely the next convention we will even possibly be able to attend if it happens will be PAX West.

312
00:22:27,122 --> 00:22:28,816
Scott: Well, that was already the next convention.

313
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:35,860
Rym: Yeah Well, I was gonna be a Zenka Khan and ConnectiCon some other stuff, but I'm assuming everything through packs is cancelled.

314
00:22:35,981 --> 00:22:37,869
Rym: I'm not even gonna bother trying to go to those con.

315
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,416
Scott: X may even be cancelled.

316
00:22:39,436 --> 00:22:39,998
Rym: It may well be.

317
00:22:41,021 --> 00:22:43,140
Rym: Hopefully things are good by unplugged and magfest.

318
00:22:43,933 --> 00:22:44,279
Scott: We'll see.

319
00:22:45,344 --> 00:22:46,498
Rym: I'm already making magfest plans.

320
00:22:47,524 --> 00:22:48,259
Scott: All right, that's good.

321
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:49,703
Scott: We need those.

322
00:22:49,963 --> 00:22:50,144
Rym: Yep.

323
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:59,991
Rym: So, uh, we are reviewing two board games today because while they're both pretty good And they're pretty deep games in terms of like what we could say about them.

324
00:23:00,553 --> 00:23:02,460
Rym: There's not a lot to say about them.

325
00:23:03,002 --> 00:23:04,972
Scott: No, no, no, they're relatively simple.

326
00:23:05,012 --> 00:23:06,559
Rym: There's a lot of reasons why this will be.

327
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:15,224
Rym: There's not a lot to say so even though we always try to stretch it out and only do one game per show I feel like we really need to have talked about two games Mm-hmm.

328
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:21,236
Rym: So let's start with the game that I think we Internalized more and that I think we played more than once.

329
00:23:21,537 --> 00:23:25,554
Rym: that one Yep, and that I think we will want to own if you don't buy it.

330
00:23:25,594 --> 00:23:28,245
Scott: I'll buy it because Matt This was actually citizen.

331
00:23:28,285 --> 00:23:31,660
Scott: first look at PAX East and it was actually our friend Matt's copy.

332
00:23:31,741 --> 00:23:32,748
Scott: That was in the first look.

333
00:23:32,788 --> 00:23:33,775
Scott: not PAX is copy.

334
00:23:34,057 --> 00:23:36,925
Scott: Yep They're going.

335
00:23:37,247 --> 00:23:42,780
Scott: the game is called no return as As kinds of look if I don't know how to pronounce that German.

336
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:51,380
Scott: But I do know that the the the it translates to there is no turning back Right and the game designer is Marco toy Bner.

337
00:23:52,404 --> 00:24:08,700
Scott: And basically there is no turning back is exactly what this game is about, you know We've played tons of board games out there that have some sort of dual currency system Right where the way to win the game is to get victory points, but there's also this other currency like money, right?

338
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,182
Scott: So in st.

339
00:24:09,202 --> 00:24:12,336
Scott: Petersburg, it's very literal this victory points and there's coins.

340
00:24:12,678 --> 00:24:16,740
Scott: Yeah in Puerto Rico there's doubloons and victory points.

341
00:24:16,842 --> 00:24:17,442
Rym: Yeah I do.

342
00:24:17,482 --> 00:24:24,449
Rym: balloon in round two is worth way more than a doubloon in round eight Right and race to the galaxy, which is similar to Puerto Rico.

343
00:24:24,469 --> 00:24:27,096
Scott: It's a little more abstract than that, right?

344
00:24:27,457 --> 00:24:30,500
Scott: Yeah in Agricola It's a little bit more abstract, right?

345
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:36,560
Scott: But there are some resources in the game it over Agricola that are worth less points and some that are worth more points.

346
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,940
Scott: But the ones that are worth less points can be used to purchase things that get you points.

347
00:24:41,141 --> 00:24:45,995
Rym: So like if you if you've played Dominion There's it's a got a really good example because early in the game you're trying to get money.

348
00:24:46,035 --> 00:24:56,754
Rym: you're getting so you're like to have More buying power you're getting powers But none of those things actually win the game for you or wins the game for you are those green cards that don't do anything Usually right exactly.

349
00:24:57,076 --> 00:25:02,434
Rym: So no Panic time happens when people realize the game's ending and they get as many green cards as they can.

350
00:25:02,454 --> 00:25:10,260
Scott: All right, so the the implicit Idea in all of those games is that you have to decide at some point in the game.

351
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:13,269
Scott: Obviously in the early game, you're not getting the victory points.

352
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,594
Scott: You're in the early game.

353
00:25:14,614 --> 00:25:16,520
Scott: You can't get the victory points.

354
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:22,286
Scott: You're getting all these other things to build a machine to get the victory points and it's sort of a gradual Gray line.

355
00:25:22,346 --> 00:25:24,700
Scott: you can get some victory points early, right?

356
00:25:25,101 --> 00:25:38,000
Scott: You can also maybe get some big money late and you can sort of Transition slowly from focusing on one to the other as the game goes and sort of feel your way through Right and then at the duchy panic time hard shift into victory point only mode.

357
00:25:38,224 --> 00:25:48,248
Scott: Yeah, no No return is a game that is pretty much taking that game mechanic making it explicit and Focusing on it to the exclusion of all else.

358
00:25:48,368 --> 00:25:57,180
Rym: Yeah, so every you're just going around and every turn you're basically like do I Continue to do the a phase or do I say fuck it and go to the B phase, right?

359
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:08,200
Scott: You literally on your turn your everyone starts in phase a. in phase a what you're doing is adding your Taking tiles and building up a pool of points right that you could score.

360
00:26:08,823 --> 00:26:12,680
Scott: Right, so and then at the beginning of any of your turns you can say, you know what?

361
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,592
Scott: I am switching to phase B. And of course the name of the game.

362
00:26:15,612 --> 00:26:17,280
Scott: There's no turning back, right?

363
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,680
Scott: And as soon as you're in phase B, you can no longer increase your point pool.

364
00:26:21,841 --> 00:26:30,340
Scott: Your maximum score has been set But you are using the rest of the game in order to take that pool of points and actually convert it into points.

365
00:26:31,101 --> 00:26:38,240
Scott: Alright, so if you were to switch in a phase B too early you would end up converting all your potential points into points.

366
00:26:38,441 --> 00:26:39,364
Scott: And you're you would end up.

367
00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:45,140
Scott: the game would continue going with extra turns because you've switched too early And now you're not your met.

368
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:50,440
Scott: Your score is not gonna be as high as it could have been had you switched a turn later and had a bigger pool.

369
00:26:51,247 --> 00:26:58,720
Scott: If you switch too late What will end up happening is you have a big pool of points that's full of so many points and you can't convert them.

370
00:26:59,001 --> 00:27:06,789
Scott: And then the game ends with some of your points are unconverted and even worse unconverted points are negative points Unconverted points are negative.

371
00:27:06,829 --> 00:27:16,310
Scott: So literally the entire game is decide exactly the right moment of switching from Increase your point pool to choose.

372
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:19,500
Scott: you start eating up your point pool and converting it into actual points.

373
00:27:20,363 --> 00:27:23,333
Scott: Right, so the same as many many other board games.

374
00:27:23,614 --> 00:27:29,133
Scott: only just that one mechanic You know just super super polished.

375
00:27:29,555 --> 00:27:30,800
Scott: one thing one thing early

376
00:27:31,362 --> 00:27:45,180
Rym: And if you play it with people who are canny at games and who recognize this game for what it is It feels like a high-stakes poker game Like everyone's playing real carefully everyone's looking at each other and then suddenly someone's like phase B and then oh shit

377
00:27:45,983 --> 00:27:53,880
Scott: Right, if you think of a normal board game that has a lot of different things going on Right like a typical euro game is like maybe you know, like a chocolate chip cookie, right?

378
00:27:54,363 --> 00:28:03,840
Scott: This is literally just a chocolate chip It's all marshmallow one ingredient and they made that ingredient digestible and it's pure uncooked form.

379
00:28:04,181 --> 00:28:05,886
Rym: It's just eating the insides of Oreos.

380
00:28:05,986 --> 00:28:09,517
Rym: It's just eating the marshmallows from Lucky Charms and not eating the rest of that poison.

381
00:28:10,099 --> 00:28:14,963
Scott: Yep So yeah, if you you know, the game is quick It's me.

382
00:28:14,983 --> 00:28:19,347
Scott: It's just a bunch of tiles in a in a in a in a bag, basically Yeah, they could be.

383
00:28:19,367 --> 00:28:20,716
Rym: cards like this could be a card game.

384
00:28:20,756 --> 00:28:23,995
Scott: just fine I think the tiles make it easy.

385
00:28:24,055 --> 00:28:24,800
Scott: I guess it could be a card.

386
00:28:24,941 --> 00:28:33,108
Scott: I mean technically any game could be a card game because a card is the most Powerful physical game component.

387
00:28:33,248 --> 00:28:37,006
Rym: I defy you to make Maria a card game You could make.

388
00:28:37,026 --> 00:28:42,510
Scott: you could fear you couldn't make it good, but you can theoretically make Any board game out of cards only.

389
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:43,995
Scott: no matter right?

390
00:28:44,015 --> 00:28:45,320
Scott: You can replace dice with cards.

391
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,550
Scott: You can replace tiles with cards.

392
00:28:46,571 --> 00:28:47,660
Scott: You can place pawns with cards.

393
00:28:47,942 --> 00:28:50,900
Scott: Any any other game component can be replaced with cards.

394
00:28:51,080 --> 00:29:01,131
Rym: so one that's hardest to replace is maps unless you literally are just a bunch of cards and The map is just one big card.

395
00:29:01,714 --> 00:29:02,700
Scott: Yeah sure big card.

396
00:29:06,301 --> 00:29:16,995
Rym: But the mechanic the actual physical mechanics of the game are pretty good too because they're literally just you're laying out the numbers in Suits of colors and you have to go in order so you'll play.

397
00:29:17,015 --> 00:29:18,300
Rym: have this give-and-take of?

398
00:29:18,901 --> 00:29:25,560
Rym: Do I blow my load now or do I wait for more tiles to come into my hand kind of like lost cities?

399
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,746
Scott: It's basically exactly lost cities.

400
00:29:27,786 --> 00:29:28,809
Scott: the tile playing is.

401
00:29:28,909 --> 00:29:30,374
Scott: it is a hundred percent lost cities.

402
00:29:30,414 --> 00:29:32,020
Scott: you go from high to low.

403
00:29:32,808 --> 00:29:35,488
Scott: right You know you can't?

404
00:29:35,548 --> 00:29:37,399
Scott: you got to put the same color or the same stack.

405
00:29:37,863 --> 00:29:40,220
Scott: You can't go inserting something in the middle of the stack.

406
00:29:40,803 --> 00:29:42,129
Scott: Eleven ten seven.

407
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:44,059
Scott: well all your eights and nines are worthless now.

408
00:29:44,742 --> 00:29:48,635
Scott: Right you gave up on trying to find them and you can see the stacks.

409
00:29:48,775 --> 00:29:50,160
Rym: everyone else is making that part.

410
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,405
Scott: You can't see their hand.

411
00:29:51,546 --> 00:29:53,073
Rym: nope, but you can see the stacks.

412
00:29:53,494 --> 00:29:54,660
Scott: so do you know the odds?

413
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:01,791
Rym: So if a bunch of other people are really building big stacks of yellow Then that can inform your decisions in a pretty clear way.

414
00:30:02,293 --> 00:30:05,083
Scott: right and you still need you know When you're.

415
00:30:05,243 --> 00:30:12,066
Scott: when you switch to phase two let's say I build a big old yellow stack like eleven ten nine Eight seven seven.

416
00:30:12,106 --> 00:30:13,370
Scott: right it's got a lot of points in it.

417
00:30:14,092 --> 00:30:21,580
Scott: I need to have in my hand in phase two Tiles with very high number values to be able to eat those away.

418
00:30:21,701 --> 00:30:25,540
Scott: You can't eat up a lot of points unless you have big numbered tiles.

419
00:30:26,062 --> 00:30:35,560
Scott: So it can actually be dangerous to build a very strong pool Even if it doesn't take you very long to build it because it would take you so long to eat it away.

420
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:38,293
Scott: You'll be left with like an eleven left on the board.

421
00:30:38,353 --> 00:30:39,218
Scott: It's a negative eleven.

422
00:30:39,238 --> 00:30:39,620
Scott: That's bad

423
00:30:39,786 --> 00:30:58,059
Rym: Yep or maybe if you like near the end of phase one when you're getting ready for phase two if your hand is just full of giant numbers then other players might Expect that they'll be able to eat more of their point total than they possibly could and you might start phase B early and just Go for it, and they'll all be left holding the bag

424
00:30:58,647 --> 00:30:58,890
Scott: You know?

425
00:30:58,931 --> 00:30:59,660
Scott: or let's like okay?

426
00:30:59,841 --> 00:31:04,058
Scott: I got my yellows right and I skipped over nine and eight and then I get them later and I go.

427
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,324
Scott: oh I missed.

428
00:31:05,385 --> 00:31:06,530
Scott: I could have put them in my pool.

429
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:06,912
Scott: It's like well.

430
00:31:06,952 --> 00:31:07,575
Scott: No that's fine.

431
00:31:07,595 --> 00:31:10,893
Scott: That's 17 points You can now eat away from the pool you did make.

432
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:12,781
Scott: yeah, it's not too bad Just hold it You know.

433
00:31:12,821 --> 00:31:26,486
Scott: just hold on to them if you can't play them or if you see another player really needs something and if it's a big number hold on to it, but all your small numbers you kind of want to like I Feel like when you want to switch to phase two It's like you feel it coming.

434
00:31:26,526 --> 00:31:30,643
Scott: you can just sort of sense it like all right the games that we've reached the peak Play.

435
00:31:30,884 --> 00:31:34,660
Scott: play out all your small things that you can to get them out of your hand.

436
00:31:35,224 --> 00:31:46,519
Scott: So that way when you start phase B You'll have bigger things in your hand and you can have more efficient phase B. Yeah, right if you start phase B with a bunch of small things your phase B's gonna start with a whimper.

437
00:31:46,961 --> 00:31:53,549
Scott: Everyone's gonna see that you move to phase B. You're not gonna eat away that many points right away And then who knows what you're gonna draw out of the bag.

438
00:31:53,569 --> 00:31:54,473
Scott: you could be in big trouble.

439
00:31:54,754 --> 00:31:58,299
Rym: now on a more like abstract level One thing I would say to all of you is that this game?

440
00:31:59,221 --> 00:32:09,054
Rym: Well in the end be a lot like Yahtzee in that if Yahtzee mechanics are in a lot of other games if you get good At Yahtzee, then you will be good at that part of every other game that has it.

441
00:32:09,395 --> 00:32:10,680
Rym: if you get good at no return.

442
00:32:11,182 --> 00:32:15,723
Rym: You will start to recognize all the no returns and all the other games You play.

443
00:32:15,743 --> 00:32:15,883
Rym: like.

444
00:32:15,923 --> 00:32:17,329
Rym: if you play this game and get good at it.

445
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:19,638
Rym: You will be a god at st.

446
00:32:19,678 --> 00:32:20,100
Rym: Petersburg.

447
00:32:20,983 --> 00:32:24,708
Scott: Yeah, yeah pretty much like I said There's so many other games that have that mechanic.

448
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:25,691
Scott: right of.

449
00:32:26,012 --> 00:32:28,360
Scott: when do I switch from doing you know working on?

450
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,447
Scott: This part of the game to that other part of the game?

451
00:32:30,468 --> 00:32:32,756
Scott: right you know pretty much every euro game.

452
00:32:32,776 --> 00:32:35,360
Scott: what crown of Amara Rym's favorite?

453
00:32:36,341 --> 00:32:39,150
Scott: Even seven wonders right when do I seven wonders.

454
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:42,460
Scott: you start out by building up your little resource stack and then later?

455
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,599
Scott: You're playing greens and blues.

456
00:32:44,541 --> 00:32:45,124
Scott: Right right.

457
00:32:45,204 --> 00:32:45,827
Scott: It's like all right.

458
00:32:45,847 --> 00:32:47,112
Scott: I don't need more resources anymore.

459
00:32:47,172 --> 00:32:49,020
Scott: green green green science science science.

460
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:49,802
Rym: Yeah, the minion.

461
00:32:49,822 --> 00:32:52,371
Rym: I'm like dutchy dutchy dutchy dutchy right.

462
00:32:52,712 --> 00:33:00,816
Scott: so get good at this game, and then you will be able to See this same mechanic in every other game and be good at it as well.

463
00:33:01,056 --> 00:33:04,629
Rym: quick to play quick to teach Satisfying like half-hour tops.

464
00:33:04,669 --> 00:33:06,576
Rym: to play this game including teaching.

465
00:33:06,957 --> 00:33:07,760
Scott: Yeah, you can learn it.

466
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,041
Scott: You could.

467
00:33:08,141 --> 00:33:11,108
Scott: anyone can play it accessible to everyone not just nerds.

468
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:13,454
Rym: super good, so the other game.

469
00:33:13,474 --> 00:33:13,915
Rym: We played.

470
00:33:13,935 --> 00:33:17,305
Rym: I don't Think you should buy it.

471
00:33:17,325 --> 00:33:21,077
Scott: I don't know if you can buy square on sale.

472
00:33:21,137 --> 00:33:22,020
Rym: It's an actually.

473
00:33:22,546 --> 00:33:24,804
Scott: It's actually from 2005 But it's considered.

474
00:33:24,864 --> 00:33:28,660
Scott: first look because it was not easy to obtain in the u.s.

475
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:34,115
Scott: It's like a Japanese published game, and we they somehow got a copy of it designed by a.

476
00:33:34,175 --> 00:33:35,800
Rym: so what I tied you right?

477
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:39,109
Scott: so basically what this game is is it's Othello.

478
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,876
Scott: you've played Othello also.

479
00:33:40,916 --> 00:33:43,602
Scott: that is Iago or Reversi.

480
00:33:43,883 --> 00:33:46,011
Rym: it's weird how many people to only notice Reversi.

481
00:33:46,111 --> 00:33:48,400
Rym: I ran into a co-worker like last month who?

482
00:33:48,801 --> 00:33:50,908
Rym: Literally had no idea what Othello was.

483
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:57,253
Scott: I knew it as a fellow because that's what the board game in the store was called Right, but then on like on the computer.

484
00:33:57,273 --> 00:33:58,298
Scott: I was like Reversi.

485
00:33:58,338 --> 00:33:58,740
Scott: What's that?

486
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:10,239
Scott: And I'm like oh, it's Othello same same and then and then on Linux in KDE Linux KDE on Linux there was a there was like K Iago or something and I was like what is Iago?

487
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,417
Scott: I'm like oh, it's Reversi.

488
00:34:12,601 --> 00:34:14,632
Scott: How many different names are there for this stupid game?

489
00:34:14,693 --> 00:34:16,060
Scott: It's like Klondike solitaire.

490
00:34:16,442 --> 00:34:19,014
Scott: It's all these same names for this different names of this game now.

491
00:34:19,034 --> 00:34:24,271
Rym: I've never seen a game Incorporate Othello so nakedly before except like.

492
00:34:24,592 --> 00:34:26,076
Rym: actually you know what did of all things?

493
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:27,560
Rym: Wario were on the Gamecube?

494
00:34:28,202 --> 00:34:30,088
Rym: Yes, but it did.

495
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:35,659
Rym: but the point I want to make and just remember what I'm about to say And we'll get to it in later in this review.

496
00:34:36,482 --> 00:34:49,300
Rym: There is a fundamental problem with Othello in that the heuristics or the math like the hard math to Actually be good at Othello are not really human implementable like humans Cannot do that.

497
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:58,210
Rym: It is very hard to learn that the right way to be good at Othello at any scale But it is trivial on a small board.

498
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:00,096
Scott: You could do it it even.

499
00:35:00,276 --> 00:35:06,445
Rym: yeah like a four Tile board sure yeah six tile It's not like the tiniest.

500
00:35:06,625 --> 00:35:08,332
Rym: as soon as you get above like three by three.

501
00:35:08,352 --> 00:35:10,179
Rym: humans cannot be good at Othello.

502
00:35:10,802 --> 00:35:12,369
Scott: Well Othello is typically played on like what?

503
00:35:12,389 --> 00:35:14,420
Scott: five by five seven by seven something like that.

504
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,850
Scott: But yeah, but a lot of the I don't know what the.

505
00:35:16,991 --> 00:35:19,080
Scott: I guess the actual board game is a huge board, right?

506
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:25,640
Scott: But the most of the apps I played where it would let you choose the board size I remember five by five and seven by seven usually being defaults.

507
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:30,493
Rym: But there is a easy algorithm for computers that can play Othello perfectly.

508
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:35,748
Rym: if you play any like random Othello online There's a decent chance it implements that algorithm.

509
00:35:35,989 --> 00:35:36,651
Rym: You will never win.

510
00:35:36,671 --> 00:35:39,580
Scott: There's literally no way to just use that algorithm in your human head.

511
00:35:40,082 --> 00:35:42,672
Rym: It's too difficult for a human to do in their head.

512
00:35:42,733 --> 00:35:44,480
Rym: I don't think anyone's ever played Othello.

513
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,086
Scott: Maybe I'll spend this this my free time.

514
00:35:47,107 --> 00:35:48,530
Rym: I tried.

515
00:35:48,811 --> 00:35:52,340
Rym: I. I actually have some really fucking complex.

516
00:35:53,266 --> 00:35:55,240
Scott: My heuristic for Othello is get in the corner.

517
00:35:55,601 --> 00:35:57,027
Scott: No one could take you once you're in the corner.

518
00:35:57,067 --> 00:36:06,540
Rym: my heuristic is based on a point value that I've assigned to every type of Square on the board and then that and then those points are mitigated or altered by board states.

519
00:36:06,942 --> 00:36:17,080
Rym: But I can't say like I can't say the rule for doing that I've just memorized certain patterns and if I see those patterns in the local area, I know how to interact with that area.

520
00:36:17,722 --> 00:36:19,649
Scott: Anyway, so square on sale is Othello.

521
00:36:19,769 --> 00:36:22,339
Scott: However, there is two big changes to this game, right?

522
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,067
Scott: Change number one.

523
00:36:24,087 --> 00:36:25,780
Scott: Is it normally in Othello?

524
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:29,034
Scott: Let's say I place in the top left corner and then the bottom right corner.

525
00:36:29,817 --> 00:36:35,359
Scott: all the Pieces on that diagonal would get filled in with my dudes if they're there like if they're filming already.

526
00:36:35,781 --> 00:36:38,974
Scott: Obviously you you're not allowed to play in a regular Othello.

527
00:36:38,994 --> 00:36:40,380
Scott: You're not allowed to play non adjacent.

528
00:36:41,463 --> 00:36:43,282
Rym: Yep, you gotta you gotta place it So there were.

529
00:36:43,302 --> 00:36:47,480
Scott: converts it so that wouldn't be a legal play in regular Othello unless they were all filled in anyway.

530
00:36:47,561 --> 00:36:48,810
Scott: Yeah, we're square on sale.

531
00:36:48,871 --> 00:36:50,703
Scott: It is a legal play for reasons We'll get into.

532
00:36:51,185 --> 00:36:59,800
Scott: but anyway, what happens in square on sale is the same thing I play one and I play another play a second piece and all the in-between places are now mine.

533
00:37:00,243 --> 00:37:11,900
Scott: but instead of just conquering them I Place my pieces on top of the enemy pieces that I've conquered Such that they're each place on the board.

534
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:26,080
Scott: each square is stacking higher and higher right and how high the stack is is how many points that spot is worth and whoever has the top piece in the stack is The owner of those points.

535
00:37:26,321 --> 00:37:38,584
Rym: So if the yeah square that changed hands more times is just worth more points to whoever has it when the game ends And the game doesn't end when the thing is full like Othello it ends based on a whole bunch of rules Right.

536
00:37:38,624 --> 00:37:42,060
Scott: The second major thing in the game is that it is a bidding game.

537
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:49,714
Scott: You don't just on your turn go on a spot that you want to go on You bid on a spot you want to go on with money, right?

538
00:37:49,814 --> 00:37:52,668
Rym: And you can then be on a random spot I could be like I'll bid on the corner.

539
00:37:52,708 --> 00:37:53,815
Rym: I'll just go on the corner right now.

540
00:37:54,459 --> 00:37:59,897
Scott: Yep And when you bid you have to basically just outbid the current bid on that spot.

541
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:03,751
Scott: if there is one There might not be one in which case you could bid like a dollar right.

542
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:11,700
Scott: you put your money on the spots that and the Next person who has to come around knows how high the bar is for bidding and then you don't get that spot.

543
00:38:12,322 --> 00:38:21,451
Scott: For three turns you bid you put the two on there it flips down to a one Right the next turn and then the turn after that.

544
00:38:21,531 --> 00:38:31,302
Scott: you actually would conquer the spot and if someone out bids you Right, they would take the countdown timer at its current state of two or one Right.

545
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:33,067
Scott: and we have so now.

546
00:38:33,167 --> 00:38:39,479
Scott: if people keep out bidding on a spot it never ticks down because it just keeps staying Yeah at its current position.

547
00:38:40,082 --> 00:38:40,745
Rym: This is a little.

548
00:38:40,765 --> 00:38:53,429
Rym: it seems a little complex and it is a little bit difficult to teach this but once you start playing it makes sense, basically, you have a limited number of dollars and you can bid and Overbid and you'll just leave a pile of dollars on the space

549
00:38:53,870 --> 00:39:01,434
Scott: and when you basically what it means is you bid on a space And you win the space if no one out bids you for twice around the board.

550
00:39:01,455 --> 00:39:06,759
Rym: Yep, but Once you win a space Yeah You put your law square on top.

551
00:39:07,141 --> 00:39:08,767
Rym: But now your money stays there.

552
00:39:09,148 --> 00:39:18,479
Rym: and if it's us any space other than the edges every round Instead of doing your bid you can spend an action to take a dollar from all the stacks you've left out there.

553
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,727
Scott: So you might normally on your right.

554
00:39:20,868 --> 00:39:27,200
Scott: so on your turn if you have any money in the middle nine spaces You would pick up one dollar from each of the nine spaces.

555
00:39:27,682 --> 00:39:33,932
Scott: Right that's left hanging out there to get your money back slowly because you have a limited money supply You just start with all your money, right?

556
00:39:34,113 --> 00:39:35,280
Scott: It's not like you're making money.

557
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:44,997
Scott: It's like you start with all your money you put it out to bid and after if you get outbid you get all the money Back, but if you successfully bid then the money you bid slowly comes back to you, right?

558
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:48,872
Scott: From I guess your people paying rent who live in the building you own.

559
00:39:48,892 --> 00:39:50,540
Scott: Yes is the metaphor, right?

560
00:39:50,961 --> 00:39:59,380
Scott: But if you put money on the outside spaces that not the nine central spaces the outside Five ten sixteen spaces, right?

561
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,462
Scott: That money?

562
00:40:01,523 --> 00:40:04,772
Scott: because the outside spaces are stronger because it's a fellow right?

563
00:40:04,792 --> 00:40:06,156
Scott: Those are harder to take away.

564
00:40:06,336 --> 00:40:07,680
Scott: They're not more powerful.

565
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:15,247
Rym: They're not as powerful as an Othello because someone doesn't have to maneuver Heuristically to take them.

566
00:40:15,267 --> 00:40:19,346
Rym: they can take them just by bidding on top of you Any time.

567
00:40:19,928 --> 00:40:22,500
Scott: those out the money that you put in those outside spaces.

568
00:40:22,601 --> 00:40:24,759
Scott: You don't just get back slowly from rents.

569
00:40:25,221 --> 00:40:32,520
Scott: You have to forgo bidding for a turn and then you can take one dollar from every stack you have on an outside space.

570
00:40:32,921 --> 00:40:45,600
Scott: so if you go for a lot of outside spaces try to make lots of strong Othello plays and put out lots of your Building square tiles then you will end up with your money stuck in the outside edges of the board.

571
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:51,980
Scott: You'll have to spend your turns getting that money back when other people will come in and actually reconquer all the spaces.

572
00:40:52,261 --> 00:40:53,405
Scott: Yeah, while you're not bidding.

573
00:40:53,787 --> 00:40:55,754
Scott: and now what did you actually get right?

574
00:40:55,955 --> 00:40:57,200
Rym: and then I think the game ends.

575
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,284
Rym: There's a bunch of conditions.

576
00:40:58,324 --> 00:40:59,429
Rym: But what are the conditions?

577
00:40:59,469 --> 00:41:01,979
Rym: is I think what if every square square has something in it?

578
00:41:03,001 --> 00:41:05,353
Scott: Yeah, I think if every square has something in it the game end.

579
00:41:05,413 --> 00:41:06,700
Rym: if one player puts out others.

580
00:41:07,082 --> 00:41:09,914
Scott: Yeah, if you put out all your squares the game ends.

581
00:41:09,974 --> 00:41:13,900
Rym: Yeah, I Forget there might be another end condition, but there's another.

582
00:41:14,964 --> 00:41:16,140
Scott: This is one other mechanic.

583
00:41:16,861 --> 00:41:21,720
Scott: There's one other mechanic involving some jammies on the board to incentivize you spaces.

584
00:41:21,941 --> 00:41:25,120
Scott: There's little jammies on the board at the early game.

585
00:41:25,281 --> 00:41:28,758
Scott: So that let you like, you know can't get some extra points here and there.

586
00:41:29,381 --> 00:41:33,740
Scott: It's a sort of so if you go early and get conquered late, you still got some points for going early.

587
00:41:34,505 --> 00:41:35,613
Scott: But that's not really a big deal.

588
00:41:35,673 --> 00:41:38,724
Scott: It's more of a balancer Yep, though.

589
00:41:38,785 --> 00:41:40,493
Rym: They are substantial amounts of points.

590
00:41:40,533 --> 00:41:41,860
Rym: It's hard to get points in this game.

591
00:41:42,281 --> 00:41:44,870
Scott: Yeah, they're not insignificant, but they're they're just sort of like there.

592
00:41:45,111 --> 00:41:47,760
Rym: but that endgame condition that sort of leads to my point.

593
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,730
Rym: Remember that heuristic thing.

594
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:53,291
Rym: So Othello has Non-human like implementable heuristics like Othello.

595
00:41:53,733 --> 00:42:03,120
Rym: humans basically can't be good at Othello But this game plays in the same heuristic space, but because of all these differences from Othello.

596
00:42:03,925 --> 00:42:05,819
Rym: No, Othello heuristics actually work.

597
00:42:06,381 --> 00:42:24,071
Rym: So it's as complex as Othello in terms of humans probably can't build reasonable heuristics But simultaneously people are good at Othello will not actually necessarily be good at this game because for example in Othello If you get a corner space, there is literally no way to lose that.

598
00:42:24,593 --> 00:42:28,538
Rym: No, like it's invincible in this game Like corner spaces just get eaten.

599
00:42:29,734 --> 00:42:36,773
Rym: in Othello you can assign very clear point values to like how Worthwhile the space is because once the space is in it's locked in.

600
00:42:36,813 --> 00:42:38,800
Rym: it can only be taken from you by being attacked.

601
00:42:39,101 --> 00:42:49,693
Rym: within the placement rules of the game here, there are multiple avenues for attack and Othello ends Well when the game is sort of full and complete kind of like a go ending.

602
00:42:50,094 --> 00:42:52,160
Rym: but this game ends on other conditions.

603
00:42:52,321 --> 00:42:54,610
Rym: So you can't rely on the board filling.

604
00:42:54,891 --> 00:42:57,100
Rym: the game might end well before it fills and you're just hosed.

605
00:42:57,461 --> 00:43:01,980
Rym: So you can't even rely on any knowledge of Othello to be good at this game, right?

606
00:43:02,041 --> 00:43:07,121
Scott: Like I had a pretty good play on the board but then the game ended before my Night.

607
00:43:07,202 --> 00:43:16,153
Scott: the ticker ran out on my bid and the result of that was I didn't make the big play and my score Suffered a lot because of the timing of the game ending.

608
00:43:16,213 --> 00:43:17,480
Scott: not even worse made a bad play.

609
00:43:17,701 --> 00:43:20,800
Rym: I was doing really well in the beginning, but then I lost a bunch of places.

610
00:43:21,161 --> 00:43:31,960
Rym: But that was fine because based on my Othello heuristics because I played a hell a lot of Othello I knew that I would be able to retake those places pretty easily and I had a plan.

611
00:43:32,141 --> 00:43:37,640
Rym: And then again the game ended early which is not something that Othello heuristics take into account and I just got boned.

612
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,236
Rym: I went from being in first place by a lot to being in second to last place.

613
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:45,951
Scott: Yep So even though it's a pretty simple game, it's just got what.

614
00:43:46,051 --> 00:43:52,660
Scott: three or four components right up board squares Little money tokens and some jimmies, right?

615
00:43:53,061 --> 00:43:59,580
Scott: It's all it is is bidding on spaces and then Othello wing when you win the space Right and then adding up score.

616
00:43:59,641 --> 00:44:02,724
Scott: There's not a lot going on But there is way too much.

617
00:44:03,226 --> 00:44:08,940
Scott: that particular combination of simple ingredients ends up being way too complex for human brains.

618
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:15,695
Rym: Yep, I don't think if I played this ten more times I would be recognizably better at it.

619
00:44:17,622 --> 00:44:22,020
Rym: Like I don't think I could get better at it without study and like for Othello.

620
00:44:22,241 --> 00:44:23,946
Rym: You know how I got better at Othello as a kid.

621
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:30,048
Rym: study like reading books on it and like playing out Scenarios and memorizing patterns.

622
00:44:30,489 --> 00:44:39,320
Rym: that is what it would take to be very good at this game And I don't know if normal people are willing able to do that or if it's even worthwhile to do it.

623
00:44:39,861 --> 00:44:49,295
Scott: I don't know if the ceiling on the game is as high as go but it's very very high and the floor is Definitely lower than goes floor.

624
00:44:49,335 --> 00:44:50,140
Scott: I think this is much more.

625
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:53,074
Scott: It's a much more accessible game than go like in go.

626
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:58,900
Scott: You just basically just get destroyed until you get good enough and recognize enough patterns.

627
00:44:59,542 --> 00:45:02,570
Scott: You can actually kind of play this if you just have some brains.

628
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:09,900
Scott: Yep, right, but you can't play it really well Right without a lot like super genius level.

629
00:45:10,221 --> 00:45:12,291
Rym: It's almost like while I was playing it like.

630
00:45:12,311 --> 00:45:14,261
Rym: I like to talk a lot about brain field and games Like.

631
00:45:14,281 --> 00:45:15,266
Rym: what does this game feel like?

632
00:45:15,909 --> 00:45:18,200
Rym: this game didn't feel like anything?

633
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:18,681
Rym: I was.

634
00:45:19,104 --> 00:45:26,140
Rym: I was like reverting back to these like raw Naked heuristics and like I could not model the game in my brain.

635
00:45:26,702 --> 00:45:29,070
Rym: I was following when we first started like three or four rounds in.

636
00:45:29,111 --> 00:45:38,211
Rym: I was modeling it based on Othello and then because of the bidding and everything suddenly my mental model Deviated rapidly from what the game was actually doing.

637
00:45:38,452 --> 00:45:43,128
Rym: so I had to throw it all away and just play completely raw and the only the only

638
00:45:43,168 --> 00:45:52,720
Scott: way I was able to keep the game in my brain is what I was doing was basically Like it became I would try to look and figure out what to do and it became so messy that I just went like blank.

639
00:45:53,402 --> 00:45:59,380
Scott: And when I ended up what I ended up doing was just focusing on a small part of the game only and ignoring the rest.

640
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:00,483
Scott: Yep, being like, okay.

641
00:46:00,523 --> 00:46:01,486
Scott: Here's my guys.

642
00:46:02,027 --> 00:46:02,810
Scott: Here's the play.

643
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:05,156
Scott: Here's a play that I see that I can make.

644
00:46:05,577 --> 00:46:06,199
Scott: that could work.

645
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:11,354
Scott: I'll recognize this one aspect of the game and focus on that and ignore everything else.

646
00:46:11,996 --> 00:46:16,979
Scott: and that didn't work out great But it got me to help me make a decision at least so about what to do.

647
00:46:17,761 --> 00:46:28,797
Rym: I want to play it again, but I don't think that will change anything I have to say about the game and I Really can't recommend anyone buy it.

648
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:32,934
Scott: No, I mean first of all I don't recommend you.

649
00:46:32,974 --> 00:46:35,487
Scott: buy it because this is such an easy game to make.

650
00:46:35,688 --> 00:46:38,018
Scott: true You can you don't really need to buy it.

651
00:46:38,218 --> 00:46:45,147
Rym: if you could find like your grandpa's Othello You know the one with the green board and the little plastic things like the little.

652
00:46:45,208 --> 00:46:52,288
Scott: also I don't know if the game even has a publisher in the United States or in English.

653
00:46:53,533 --> 00:46:56,030
Scott: We were playing like a you know sort of a messy looking.

654
00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:58,541
Scott: I don't even know who published the copy we were playing well.

655
00:46:58,682 --> 00:47:00,510
Scott: It wasn't the original Japanese published.

656
00:47:00,992 --> 00:47:06,130
Scott: Maybe it was the European one, but we had rules printed from the internet clearly and not a real rule book.

657
00:47:07,911 --> 00:47:12,785
Scott: So yeah, I don't even know if you can purchase it if you can you know.

658
00:47:12,905 --> 00:47:17,596
Rym: this is there are two Threads in the board game geek forum for this.

659
00:47:17,897 --> 00:47:22,670
Rym: the first one was started 15 years ago, and it just says more information.

660
00:47:24,172 --> 00:47:27,149
Rym: The second thread is how to get a copy from eight months ago.

661
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:31,903
Rym: There are a total of nine posts about this game on all of board game geek right.

662
00:47:31,984 --> 00:47:44,088
Scott: so if this is if this game is up Your alley I recommend You know making a copy and playing it that way and if you get really into it Find a way to get a legit copy.

663
00:47:44,148 --> 00:47:53,506
Scott: somehow I could see a publisher like say big cat games or someone publishing this in English at some point But I don't think that's happening right now.

664
00:47:54,754 --> 00:47:57,289
Scott: So do what you can, but yeah, this is not for everyone.

665
00:47:58,712 --> 00:48:07,645
Scott: But if you are someone who cares about games likes really hard games likes abstract games and bidding games you want that blank feeling that Scott described the like.

666
00:48:08,147 --> 00:48:11,144
Rym: I am in a world with no Heuristics like a world with no rules.

667
00:48:11,225 --> 00:48:11,749
Rym: What do I do?

668
00:48:12,731 --> 00:48:19,183
Rym: Yeah, like if you want a game where you can't apply Most of the things you know about games to it to get better at it quickly.

669
00:48:19,203 --> 00:48:20,990
Rym: This is the game for you, right?

670
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:21,211
Scott: It's like.

671
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:22,055
Scott: you know about bidding.

672
00:48:22,135 --> 00:48:22,939
Scott: that doesn't help you.

673
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:24,185
Scott: you know about a fellow.

674
00:48:24,225 --> 00:48:26,260
Scott: that doesn't help you even though It's a bidding a fellow.

675
00:48:26,705 --> 00:48:29,591
Rym: primarily It's almost.

676
00:48:29,771 --> 00:48:29,932
Rym: you know.

677
00:48:29,952 --> 00:48:30,653
Rym: you know what it's like.

678
00:48:31,054 --> 00:48:31,975
Rym: you know in.

679
00:48:32,536 --> 00:48:34,139
Rym: oh god and music started playing.

680
00:48:34,219 --> 00:48:34,620
Rym: okay there we go.

681
00:48:35,761 --> 00:48:37,669
Rym: There's no weird pipeline with the remote thing.

682
00:48:37,911 --> 00:48:43,166
Rym: I think that got recorded on your channel, but anyway This you know.

683
00:48:43,186 --> 00:48:44,070
Rym: where was I going?

684
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:45,416
Rym: I lost my entire train of thought.

685
00:48:45,456 --> 00:48:46,139
Rym: now I went blank.

686
00:48:46,923 --> 00:48:52,128
Rym: You know when you there's a language like German language You don't speak and there's cognates like some languages.

687
00:48:52,209 --> 00:48:58,200
Rym: use the same or a similar sounding word to mean something like tea Chai chai like you can kind of figure stuff out.

688
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:07,656
Rym: It sounds very similar, but then there's false cognates a word that sounds a lot like a word You know, but it actually means something completely different like in French.

689
00:49:07,997 --> 00:49:13,714
Rym: I was writing a thing I remember I said like my aunt a formidable like my aunt is formidable.

690
00:49:13,995 --> 00:49:15,720
Rym: that does not really mean formidable.

691
00:49:17,061 --> 00:49:20,450
Rym: That's not what that means in English effectively, but formidable.

692
00:49:20,871 --> 00:49:22,756
Rym: and what formidable actually means in French.

693
00:49:22,816 --> 00:49:24,420
Rym: like they're not really the same thing.

694
00:49:24,822 --> 00:49:29,023
Rym: So you can be led astray by it appearing to be similar to something You know right.

695
00:49:29,063 --> 00:49:33,420
Scott: in Spanish someone might say cerveza, and you might think oh does that have to do with service, right?

696
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:33,681
Scott: It's like.

697
00:49:33,722 --> 00:49:34,487
Scott: no that means beer.

698
00:49:34,648 --> 00:49:35,434
Scott: yep, okay.

699
00:49:35,515 --> 00:49:35,918
Scott: It's like.

700
00:49:36,824 --> 00:49:40,720
Rym: so This game has the is false heuristics.

701
00:49:42,021 --> 00:49:50,219
Rym: Yes, if you try to be good at that if you if you're good at bidding and good at Othello I think you will do worse at this game than somebody was never played a bidding game and has never played Othello

702
00:49:51,002 --> 00:49:53,655
Scott: Mm-hmm all right, so yeah, that's that's enough of that.

703
00:49:53,796 --> 00:49:54,459
Rym: I think that was a show.

704
00:49:59,324 --> 00:50:01,860
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

705
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:06,775
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

706
00:50:06,996 --> 00:50:12,034
Scott: be sure to visit our website At front row crew comm for show notes discussion news and more.

707
00:50:12,275 --> 00:50:19,660
Rym: remember GeekNights is not one But four different shows sci-tech Mondays gaming Tuesdays anime comic Wednesdays and indiscriminate Thursdays.

708
00:50:20,041 --> 00:50:23,195
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons attribution 3.0 license.

709
00:50:24,441 --> 00:50:29,215
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience, but unlike those other late shows.

710
00:50:29,336 --> 00:50:30,660
Scott: It's actually recorded at night.

711
00:50:32,381 --> 00:50:37,180
Rym: And the patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights the first time we've ever done this remote.

712
00:50:37,483 --> 00:50:43,553
Rym: That was harder than you would have expected even though We don't actually look at each other when we do the show being in the same room.

713
00:50:44,195 --> 00:50:49,872
Rym: There's a little bit of body language And such and also there's a slight delay in discord.

714
00:50:50,173 --> 00:50:52,360
Rym: that actually makes it really easy to talk over each other.

715
00:50:52,481 --> 00:50:53,859
Rym: So we're gonna have to get better at this.

716
00:50:54,301 --> 00:51:00,960
Rym: But anyway, the patreon patrons for this quarantine episode of GeekNights are Ellen Joyce, Heidi McNichol, Barty Green.

717
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,740
Rym: Yeah, just like a dude guy kashar tavish and link eg you hold the queer to my heart.

718
00:51:06,062 --> 00:51:07,875
Rym: I got in one little fight and my mom got scared.

719
00:51:07,915 --> 00:51:21,860
Rym: Clinton Walton J Bants right from New Zealand Ryan parent or open letter Nicholas Brando Chris midkiff the thirst for hydrated Gannon dread lily tannenbrae Chris Reimer Finn Sean Klein Thomas on Shervin Mount Horrell and a whole bunch of other people who do not want me to say their name.

720
00:51:22,305 --> 00:51:26,550
Rym: Stay safe out there Be like Rym and Scott and social distance if you can.

721
00:51:26,912 --> 00:51:33,854
Scott: and now I leave you with The problem with comic books if the ink comes off on your hands.

722
00:51:34,416 --> 00:51:37,047
