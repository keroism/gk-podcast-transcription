00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,620
Rym: It's Thursday, February 13th, 2020.

2
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:12,001
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,141 --> 00:00:15,410
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight cleaning.

4
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,074
Scott: Let's do this Cuz.

5
00:00:21,114 --> 00:00:23,190
Rym: we're in our 30s and that's what gets us excited.

6
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:27,890
Rym: That's just I mean, you know People always make those jokes.

7
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:34,869
Rym: But like it is very funny to me that the things I get like I still get excited about my nerdy shit and video games And anime and like all my nonsense.

8
00:00:35,392 --> 00:00:43,678
Rym: But now I also get excited by things like getting a new armoire or Like cleaning up my apartment.

9
00:00:43,699 --> 00:00:44,864
Rym: Mm-hmm.

10
00:00:44,904 --> 00:00:48,563
Scott: That's how life goes anyway You know, it's like you're at work looking at the bad screen.

11
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:48,985
Scott: you come home.

12
00:00:49,025 --> 00:00:49,830
Scott: Look at the good screen.

13
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,276
Scott: Yeah, it's like anything you do.

14
00:00:51,336 --> 00:00:58,830
Scott: that's not at work, you know, it can be exciting Especially when you have the mentality we do of always trying to do things in the best way.

15
00:00:59,011 --> 00:01:02,717
Scott: Yeah, so even if it's a boring thing You know, it's like you.

16
00:01:02,957 --> 00:01:04,443
Scott: the fun part is not the thing.

17
00:01:04,503 --> 00:01:12,110
Scott: the fun part is, you know Researching trying to find the best one the best technique improving the technique, right?

18
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:13,697
Scott: You know that sort of thing.

19
00:01:13,738 --> 00:01:17,214
Rym: That's why it's a lot of games like as I get very good at them I tend to lose interest in them.

20
00:01:17,455 --> 00:01:17,635
Scott: Yep.

21
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,590
Rym: So, uh speaking of gaming, uh, I'm that weirdo who has two keyboards on his desk.

22
00:01:22,991 --> 00:01:23,934
Rym: Okay, I have my.

23
00:01:24,515 --> 00:01:29,670
Rym: well because I when I type a lot I type really fast and I like good clicky keys.

24
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:36,890
Rym: So I have the cherry MX blues and my fancy DOS keyboard, but cherry MX blues suck for playing first-person shooters.

25
00:01:37,131 --> 00:01:38,697
Rym: Oh, yeah, they're a big problem for that.

26
00:01:38,777 --> 00:01:39,781
Scott: Oh, you gotta have some Reds.

27
00:01:40,082 --> 00:01:42,110
Rym: Yep, but the Reds suck for typing.

28
00:01:42,593 --> 00:01:43,839
Scott: I mean, they don't suck for typing.

29
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,729
Rym: They're not they don't they're not.

30
00:01:46,051 --> 00:01:46,272
Rym: It's a.

31
00:01:46,654 --> 00:01:48,141
Scott: they're not ideal, but it's fine.

32
00:01:48,202 --> 00:01:49,910
Rym: Well, they're the Ford Escort of typing.

33
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:53,006
Rym: They're better than a chicklet like light not light years beyond.

34
00:01:53,047 --> 00:01:53,630
Rym: but they're the Ford.

35
00:01:54,732 --> 00:01:56,586
Rym: They're not fine compared to a cherry MX blue.

36
00:01:56,687 --> 00:01:57,009
Scott: They're fine.

37
00:01:57,411 --> 00:02:05,256
Rym: So I have my DOS keyboard and then I also have sitting here almost like one of those old organs a Smaller keyboard without the numpad.

38
00:02:05,276 --> 00:02:07,706
Rym: You don't need that for gaming if that has cherry MX Reds in it.

39
00:02:07,767 --> 00:02:08,530
Rym: That's what I came with.

40
00:02:09,453 --> 00:02:14,852
Rym: so the other day I Turned on my computer and it wouldn't boot Mm-hmm.

41
00:02:15,173 --> 00:02:17,941
Rym: I was just like, uh, that that was scary.

42
00:02:17,961 --> 00:02:21,030
Rym: Yeah, so I fucks with a little bit like won't even get into BIOS.

43
00:02:21,553 --> 00:02:24,670
Rym: So I do the like a low-level troubleshooting and it becomes pretty apparent.

44
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:34,653
Rym: There's a USB issue up because I notice that both keyboards Every time I turn the power on the caps lock light and the scroll lock light are both a red or blue Depending which keyboard it is.

45
00:02:34,733 --> 00:02:35,435
Rym: one is red one is blue.

46
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:35,897
Rym: Uh-huh.

47
00:02:36,278 --> 00:02:40,109
Rym: So I unplug the gaming keyboard and everything's fine.

48
00:02:41,671 --> 00:02:43,437
Scott: So probably some sort of short in the keyboard.

49
00:02:43,457 --> 00:02:45,023
Scott: that's messing up the whole thing.

50
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:45,404
Rym: Yep.

51
00:02:45,745 --> 00:02:46,648
Scott: So I had USBs.

52
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,383
Rym: Yep, so I start investigating and I'm not sure.

53
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:50,469
Rym: I gotta test it now.

54
00:02:50,852 --> 00:02:51,235
Rym: I'm pretty.

55
00:02:51,295 --> 00:02:59,088
Rym: I'm not sure if it's the keyboard or the cable But I noticed something really bad about this keyboard that I never noticed before because it has a detachable cord.

56
00:02:59,649 --> 00:03:07,030
Rym: cool Oh, you can get replace it then Yeah I could and I thought oh I'll replace the cord and see if that fixes it and if it does or doesn't that's my next step.

57
00:03:07,732 --> 00:03:11,781
Rym: So I pull the cord out and then I noticed something I'd never noticed.

58
00:03:12,303 --> 00:03:16,393
Rym: the connector to the keyboard is not USB.

59
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:18,139
Rym: like you.

60
00:03:18,179 --> 00:03:19,343
Rym: I'm not gonna get into the detail.

61
00:03:19,363 --> 00:03:23,113
Scott: My keyboard has a Mini or micro.

62
00:03:23,133 --> 00:03:25,801
Rym: I forget micro is the good one the tiny one.

63
00:03:25,921 --> 00:03:28,910
Scott: The point is it's mini is the obsolete fucking one.

64
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,403
Rym: That's not used on anything right anymore.

65
00:03:31,423 --> 00:03:32,690
Scott: It's used on quite a few things.

66
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:43,610
Scott: No, it has been replaced by micro but there is still lots of things that are just not updated Yep, and still come with but not like most things that were would have used mini if they didn't go to micro.

67
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:47,530
Rym: They never go to a full-size like USB C like the big blocky.

68
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:53,930
Rym: So, yeah The things I have that have mini on them are all things that are more than like a decade old.

69
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:56,681
Scott: I have like a rear bike light and you charge it with mini.

70
00:03:56,942 --> 00:04:00,613
Scott: Ah, that's the worst and I have What else has me.

71
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:04,886
Rym: even my bike stuff is like micro like everything's micro except most of it is.

72
00:04:04,946 --> 00:04:07,606
Scott: but this still occasionally a thing I'm like, oh that's a mini thing.

73
00:04:07,646 --> 00:04:11,182
Rym: Wow But the only things I have that are mini are like decade old bullshit.

74
00:04:11,343 --> 00:04:13,170
Rym: and apparently this one keyboard.

75
00:04:13,632 --> 00:04:16,084
Rym: I don't own a single USB mini cord.

76
00:04:16,346 --> 00:04:21,726
Rym: Oh, I got a lot Yeah, uh, yeah, if you have one, I will borrow it from you guys.

77
00:04:21,786 --> 00:04:29,130
Rym: I got some Yeah, so then I'll find out if this keyboard is broken Which I'll be sad about because I really like this keyboard or if it's just that cord.

78
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:32,290
Scott: I mean even if the keyboards broken all those switches are perfectly fine.

79
00:04:32,491 --> 00:04:38,210
Rym: You can just fix the board in the probably because there's not many things that can go wrong with a keyboard.

80
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:41,309
Rym: No, there's a tiny chance something crazy went wrong with it.

81
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:47,849
Rym: But then at that point I don't care because I can afford to buy a new keyboard and I've had this keyboard for like five years.

82
00:04:49,131 --> 00:04:51,647
Rym: So, uh, yep crisis averted my computer boots.

83
00:04:51,687 --> 00:04:51,928
Rym: fine.

84
00:04:51,968 --> 00:04:56,709
Rym: now The only problem my computer has is that it still can't wake up from sleep without me fussing with it.

85
00:04:57,092 --> 00:04:59,870
Scott: And I gave up the same thing that my stupid HD PC has yep.

86
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,822
Scott: And whereas if it goes to sleep it actually just shuts down.

87
00:05:02,842 --> 00:05:05,895
Scott: Yeah, and now I have to wake it up I have to push the power button.

88
00:05:05,935 --> 00:05:09,130
Scott: I can't let it sleep and push the keyboard buttons to wake it.

89
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,116
Rym: Yeah, but a few months ago.

90
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:15,150
Scott: I actually tried like I'm a computer professional I know I tried all sorts of crazy shit to fix it and it wouldn't fit.

91
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:19,423
Rym: I ended up like running Windows debugger shit like digging through system logs.

92
00:05:19,483 --> 00:05:21,650
Rym: Yeah, I determined fuck that problem.

93
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:22,577
Rym: I don't even care anymore.

94
00:05:22,597 --> 00:05:24,330
Rym: I'll just turn the stupid fucking computer off.

95
00:05:24,471 --> 00:05:29,015
Scott: I just I just leave the HD PC on cuz it's yeah I'm not gonna leave this computer on.

96
00:05:29,055 --> 00:05:30,661
Rym: this computer draws a lot of power.

97
00:05:30,741 --> 00:05:33,650
Rym: Yeah, and if it can't go to sleep, that's a problem.

98
00:05:33,811 --> 00:05:36,304
Rym: Oh, yeah, so got any news.

99
00:05:36,806 --> 00:05:50,310
Scott: Yeah, so You know, we usually if we ever mention like any sort of awards show we usually make fun of it We usually talk about how relevant worthless and garbage they are and that opinion has not changed in any way whatsoever.

100
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:57,762
Rym: I think I always think back to Penn Jillette saying something to the effect of Every major award show on earth is just the high school.

101
00:05:57,782 --> 00:05:58,585
Rym: Whatever Awards.

102
00:05:58,826 --> 00:06:03,930
Rym: Yeah fancier clothes Exactly everyone in that audience is as bored as you were in high school.

103
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:08,209
Rym: The only difference is they're being paid a lot of money to look like they're not bored, right?

104
00:06:09,133 --> 00:06:10,405
Scott: So I've actually come.

105
00:06:10,425 --> 00:06:20,139
Scott: you know Korean award shows at first they're even more fake than the award shows we have here like Oscars and Grammys are fake bullshit.

106
00:06:20,561 --> 00:06:32,637
Scott: It's like at least they have like supposedly an Academy of old white dudes like choosing quote the best thing right the Korean like award shows are literally like There's.

107
00:06:32,778 --> 00:06:33,383
Scott: what's the choate?

108
00:06:33,423 --> 00:06:34,330
Scott: the choosing process?

109
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,541
Scott: Whoever is the most popular and never shows up.

110
00:06:37,602 --> 00:06:41,721
Scott: if you show up or giving you an award It's really just an excuse to have a bunch of performances.

111
00:06:41,741 --> 00:06:43,930
Scott: It's the awards are completely fake.

112
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:47,452
Scott: Yeah, they don't even really try to hide that at all Right.

113
00:06:47,613 --> 00:06:51,673
Scott: It's like and in some ways at first you're like, wow, this is even more fake This is bullshit.

114
00:06:51,693 --> 00:06:54,809
Scott: But then you know what you're like, wait, it's sort of actually good.

115
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:58,143
Scott: You're because you're being honest and saying yeah, you're just here to watch the performances.

116
00:06:58,163 --> 00:06:59,970
Scott: The awards are just a contrivance.

117
00:07:00,151 --> 00:07:12,581
Scott: yeah, I wish that the award shows in the US would do the same thing, but It's notable because the same thing always seems to happen is that people like us will say You know, these awards are not legitimate.

118
00:07:12,601 --> 00:07:14,888
Scott: They're a bunch of bullshit determined by old white guys.

119
00:07:14,928 --> 00:07:15,630
Scott: Why do you care?

120
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:16,233
Scott: Who wins them?

121
00:07:16,274 --> 00:07:17,180
Rym: I mean remember why.

122
00:07:17,523 --> 00:07:19,636
Scott: right if someone wins it It's like what are you bragging about?

123
00:07:19,656 --> 00:07:21,707
Scott: a bunch of old white guys chose you whatever.

124
00:07:21,727 --> 00:07:22,190
Rym: remember when?

125
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:27,609
Rym: Saw big hero six won the Oscar over things like song of the sea.

126
00:07:28,651 --> 00:07:33,970
Rym: Because and there was a quote from one of the people in the Academy who said they didn't watch those quote Chinese films.

127
00:07:34,091 --> 00:07:36,490
Rym: Yeah, anyway, that's the level of the Oscar, right?

128
00:07:37,672 --> 00:07:41,790
Scott: Why would you know that like if I'm big hero six is you know, someone who worked on that?

129
00:07:42,012 --> 00:07:43,809
Scott: It's like you're still proud of making that good thing.

130
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:49,890
Scott: Yeah, but that giving winning that Oscar gives you me no pride whatsoever because a bullshit award, right?

131
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,480
Scott: But anyway, so what's notable we've still got?

132
00:07:53,741 --> 00:07:55,305
Rym: we won the parsec award in 2000.

133
00:07:55,305 --> 00:07:56,790
Scott: It's also a bullshit award.

134
00:07:57,011 --> 00:07:59,258
Rym: So best anime podcast.

135
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:03,835
Scott: Alright, so parasite that Rym still hasn't seen one many This weekend.

136
00:08:03,855 --> 00:08:06,930
Scott: it's pretty much the champion of you know, Oscars, right?

137
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:13,370
Scott: So, you know people are like, yeah finally and not you know, white movie wins, right?

138
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:20,276
Scott: It's like, you know, I can't go back on what I said and be like, you know, yay Parasite.

139
00:08:20,356 --> 00:08:22,890
Scott: because yay what yay white guys acknowledged it.

140
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:23,251
Scott: It's like.

141
00:08:23,311 --> 00:08:25,860
Scott: no the take has to be the opposite.

142
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:30,438
Scott: the opposite take which is correct is not Hooray for parasite.

143
00:08:30,498 --> 00:08:31,363
Scott: it won an Oscar.

144
00:08:31,383 --> 00:08:33,568
Scott: It's Hooray.

145
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:35,756
Scott: This movie was so good.

146
00:08:35,777 --> 00:08:36,700
Rym: They couldn't ignore it.

147
00:08:36,881 --> 00:08:39,630
Scott: even white old white guys couldn't ignore it.

148
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,957
Scott: We don't care that it won.

149
00:08:41,318 --> 00:08:49,270
Scott: We care that the movie was so strong Right that it punched the old white guys in the face so hard that they couldn't ignore it, right?

150
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,890
Rym: I think there's a much more important takeaway.

151
00:08:51,373 --> 00:08:53,870
Rym: Finally someone made two Oscars kiss, right?

152
00:08:54,312 --> 00:09:00,898
Scott: So another thing I got to say right is that you know people were saying Oh, this is the first thing to win an Oscar.

153
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:05,330
Scott: That was an English language that had subtitles right at least for Best Picture, right?

154
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:08,179
Scott: I guess you've there been Oscars for foreign language films.

155
00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:09,243
Scott: Yeah subtitles, right?

156
00:09:09,624 --> 00:09:11,030
Scott: And then I said wait a fucking minute.

157
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:15,858
Scott: Right film people right are fucking crazy about.

158
00:09:15,898 --> 00:09:20,316
Scott: you know, not even you know Movies that involve non-white dudes.

159
00:09:20,336 --> 00:09:28,058
Scott: We're talking like, you know Fellini's or Curaçao, I guess Curaçao was not white, but he's still an old dude, right?

160
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:29,461
Scott: Right.

161
00:09:29,662 --> 00:09:32,800
Scott: They're crazy about these foreign movies, right?

162
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:37,910
Scott: You know seven samurai and eight and a half Film people fucking love those movies.

163
00:09:38,131 --> 00:09:39,980
Scott: That's like a movie any of those old white guys.

164
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:43,400
Rym: I think they only like them because they're all of those Academy guys.

165
00:09:43,664 --> 00:09:44,600
Scott: Well, I don't like eight and a half.

166
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:58,180
Scott: But anyway, the point is any of those Academy guys would say that those movies are like, oh so great Oh my god the best right, but if you look then fucking win any Oscars, yeah, right They didn't win the Oscar for Best Picture, right?

167
00:09:58,461 --> 00:10:03,497
Scott: So that made me think of another thing and that is we look at sports, right?

168
00:10:03,537 --> 00:10:04,039
Scott: There's sports.

169
00:10:04,882 --> 00:10:10,320
Scott: You know the subjectivity to them because you know, this thing's like penalties but for the most part their objective, right?

170
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,349
Scott: There was a thing that happened.

171
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:17,479
Rym: There was a clear winner If you win the Stanley Cup unless pretty much the best team at hockey unless they was cheating going on.

172
00:10:17,881 --> 00:10:21,215
Scott: There shouldn't be any like revoking or undoing right.

173
00:10:21,236 --> 00:10:28,255
Scott: but Oscars Grammys these sorts of things are just completely subjective, right?

174
00:10:28,496 --> 00:10:30,020
Scott: What was the best movie in?

175
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,545
Scott: 1962 right?

176
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:35,954
Scott: I just picked a random year, right and it's like in 1962.

177
00:10:35,954 --> 00:10:46,129
Scott: They thought it was movie a well given us, you know 60 years of Thinking about it, right if we say wait a minute.

178
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:48,616
Scott: There was this way better movie in 1962 that didn't win.

179
00:10:50,361 --> 00:10:51,344
Scott: That's a bunch of bullshit.

180
00:10:51,605 --> 00:10:57,020
Scott: There is absolutely no reason for us to not just edit the Oscars and say, you know what?

181
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,026
Scott: No, you didn't win it.

182
00:10:58,308 --> 00:10:59,618
Scott: That was the best movie that year.

183
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,503
Rym: There's no reason not to.

184
00:11:01,663 --> 00:11:17,960
Scott: I saw a great thing pointing out that we should we should be constantly in fact Whatsoever even if you get rid of the white guys that would only affect the legitimacy of well current.

185
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,685
Rym: Well, I would make a much more nuanced point.

186
00:11:19,725 --> 00:11:25,160
Rym: This is much like when we get similarly heated about how conventions track their attendance.

187
00:11:25,281 --> 00:11:26,893
Rym: There's a lot of different ways to count it.

188
00:11:27,215 --> 00:11:27,860
Rym: It's the same thing.

189
00:11:27,941 --> 00:11:29,175
Rym: You can have all these different.

190
00:11:29,195 --> 00:11:36,200
Rym: you could say What was this movie in the of this year in the context of that year and the sensibilities of that time?

191
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:41,446
Rym: based on a set of criteria versus in light of all But it's still based on.

192
00:11:41,486 --> 00:11:46,020
Scott: at the time their system was still old white guys choosing the same system they have today.

193
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,106
Scott: Yeah, but that's one metric.

194
00:11:47,146 --> 00:11:49,660
Rym: another metric would be so it was the box office gross.

195
00:11:50,563 --> 00:12:01,420
Scott: Not only should we get rid of the old white guys to have different people do the choosing but they should Re-choose for every year ever to give legitimacy to the entire thing.

196
00:12:03,502 --> 00:12:04,626
Rym: The thing is I don't know how many.

197
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:10,226
Rym: I think Choices wouldn't change much.

198
00:12:10,588 --> 00:12:13,319
Scott: No, I don't think there wouldn't be that many changes, but there would be.

199
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,252
Scott: you know There is still some significant oversights.

200
00:12:15,272 --> 00:12:16,159
Scott: Do you know how many?

201
00:12:17,101 --> 00:12:17,606
Scott: Oscars.

202
00:12:17,646 --> 00:12:21,547
Scott: the Stanley Kubrick won ever Zero, right one one one.

203
00:12:21,768 --> 00:12:22,109
Scott: He won.

204
00:12:22,129 --> 00:12:23,554
Scott: It was like for effects in 2001.

205
00:12:23,554 --> 00:12:24,096
Scott: I saw that Oscar.

206
00:12:25,441 --> 00:12:27,376
Scott: It's in the museum right over there the round one.

207
00:12:28,762 --> 00:12:29,777
Rym: That's kind of wrong.

208
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:34,759
Scott: I mean, yeah, Stanley Kubrick was a white dude, but that's wrong.

209
00:12:36,061 --> 00:12:38,811
Scott: You can't tell me that right that's right that that's how it should have been.

210
00:12:39,031 --> 00:12:40,296
Scott: we can go back and fix that.

211
00:12:40,316 --> 00:12:45,060
Rym: All right Yeah, I mean mostly I just don't watch the Oscars because they're boring.

212
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:55,130
Scott: No I haven't watched any of these award shows and it's when I was years and I don't go and look up either what the winners are but you're Inevitably faced with them on Twitter years ago when I went on.

213
00:12:55,151 --> 00:12:55,873
Scott: that also.

214
00:12:55,893 --> 00:12:58,602
Scott: parasite is fucking great and deserved to be the best Picture.

215
00:12:58,823 --> 00:12:59,547
Scott: they got it, right?

216
00:12:59,607 --> 00:13:00,150
Scott: I'm not lying.

217
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,236
Scott: I'm not gonna deny that.

218
00:13:01,437 --> 00:13:13,543
Rym: years ago I went on a week-long ski trip during the Super Bowl and all of us on the trip agreed just to as an experiment See how long we could go not knowing who won the Super Bowl and I made it about a week But that was.

219
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:17,980
Rym: but that was a Twitter existed, but it was an earlier day of Twitter compared to today.

220
00:13:18,341 --> 00:13:19,505
Rym: I feel like I could not avoid.

221
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:29,620
Scott: it is a thing even though you might remember that the Chiefs who won the Super Bowl this Year, all right, if you just wait long enough who won the Super Bowl four years ago pick it right up here.

222
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,729
Rym: I don't fucking remember who won the Super Bowl exactly.

223
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:35,426
Scott: So it's like, you know this bag unless it's a team I think what would we know?

224
00:13:35,446 --> 00:13:37,173
Scott: the parasite won best picture this year, right?

225
00:13:37,635 --> 00:13:40,186
Scott: Well one best picture last year I already forgot that's right.

226
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:43,820
Rym: So you knowing is only all and I want to say la la land.

227
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,550
Scott: I think that one but the year before.

228
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:47,058
Scott: nah, I don't think that was last year.

229
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,504
Scott: You're gonna google it.

230
00:13:49,524 --> 00:13:51,111
Scott: and now remember I am gonna google it now 2017.

231
00:13:51,111 --> 00:13:51,312
Rym: Good lord.

232
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:54,442
Scott: Okay Right.

233
00:13:54,523 --> 00:13:57,740
Scott: So, uh, yeah, you never fucking remember what won last year.

234
00:13:58,384 --> 00:14:00,440
Scott: Knowing isn't a permanent thing.

235
00:14:01,621 --> 00:14:03,708
Rym: Stanley Cup more than a few years ago, unless it's a team.

236
00:14:03,748 --> 00:14:04,932
Rym: I specifically care about.

237
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:16,931
Scott: I remember teams that have won cups recently But I could not from memory put eat be a hundred percent correct, but each team on the year I would just sort of vaguely, you know get close.

238
00:14:16,971 --> 00:14:18,659
Scott: I'd be like, yeah the caps got drunk.

239
00:14:19,121 --> 00:14:21,572
Scott: That was what two years ago and then I'll lose.

240
00:14:21,873 --> 00:14:26,422
Scott: so his blues caps fucking Someone.

241
00:14:26,442 --> 00:14:27,607
Rym: I know it's because it wasn't.

242
00:14:27,627 --> 00:14:30,056
Scott: there were a bunch of a few penguins ones back there.

243
00:14:30,076 --> 00:14:31,120
Rym: Yeah, it wasn't the Rangers.

244
00:14:31,823 --> 00:14:32,988
Scott: Yeah, well definitely wasn't me.

245
00:14:33,008 --> 00:14:33,148
Scott: Yes.

246
00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:37,020
Rym: Hey, we're not out of playoff contention yet, technically anyway.

247
00:14:38,221 --> 00:14:40,568
Rym: So some other news you've probably seen.

248
00:14:40,608 --> 00:14:44,600
Rym: there's multiple cruise ships that are basically under quarantine.

249
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,973
Scott: Well cruise ship is giant full of food luxurious.

250
00:14:48,073 --> 00:14:49,619
Scott: So it's not a bad place to be quite.

251
00:14:49,699 --> 00:14:52,060
Rym: Yes It is so I want unless it runs out of food.

252
00:14:52,321 --> 00:15:02,300
Rym: I want to talk about that because I realize something one Most cruises are awful because they're basically just floating Marriott hotels filled with disease.

253
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:11,160
Scott: Yes, I'm aware of this but I mean, I'd rather be quarantined in a Marriott Hotel then like, you know, because I'm working less Think of it more like an airplane.

254
00:15:11,642 --> 00:15:13,909
Scott: Most of the people that's a bad place to be quarantined.

255
00:15:13,969 --> 00:15:20,312
Rym: Yeah, most of the people on a cruise ship are in rooms Smaller like half the whole ship is.

256
00:15:20,433 --> 00:15:22,020
Scott: is it an island you can walk around?

257
00:15:22,401 --> 00:15:24,669
Rym: No, you can find your room if there's a quarantine.

258
00:15:24,689 --> 00:15:27,540
Scott: Well, that's some bullshit cuz just quarantine the boat.

259
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,726
Scott: Don't quarantine the individual.

260
00:15:28,786 --> 00:15:31,419
Rym: No because a bunch of people on the boat have a disease.

261
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,620
Scott: Yeah, so let it spread to everyone on the boat.

262
00:15:34,369 --> 00:15:37,731
Scott: No Then we'll die as long as doesn't spread to anyone not on.

263
00:15:37,852 --> 00:15:41,226
Rym: the point is also to protect the people on the boat from the Other people on the boat.

264
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:46,169
Scott: Well, I mean you could at least Move the people around in a strategic way.

265
00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:49,300
Scott: Yes of like the bottom floor to the diseased people.

266
00:15:49,401 --> 00:15:52,179
Rym: Yeah, so you realize here's the problem with being quarantined on a boat is one.

267
00:15:52,821 --> 00:16:03,030
Rym: most people on cruises are in tiny tiny rooms that are basically just a cot and they're all trapped in these tiny little like Jail, isn't there like a medical area that you can quarantine them in?

268
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:03,392
Scott: like in?

269
00:16:03,412 --> 00:16:05,700
Scott: you know, like you're like alien, right?

270
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:10,099
Scott: Room for like six people quarantine the dude who's got the alien is not making like the.

271
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:20,988
Rym: you know That doesn't work because one disease is like coronavirus spread before you're symptomatic like you're contagious before you're symptomatic and to Unless you go without symptoms for 14 days.

272
00:16:21,028 --> 00:16:24,500
Scott: You might be getting it right because the person's in their quarters, right?

273
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,463
Rym: They don't know who else might have it until they wait 14 days Mm-hmm.

274
00:16:28,805 --> 00:16:29,369
Rym: That's the problem.

275
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:37,060
Rym: You could bring a little bubble to their door Yeah, but then some other random person might have been exposed to it a day ago and if that person walks around they'll spread it.

276
00:16:37,342 --> 00:16:50,990
Rym: So the people on these boats the only people are having a good time are like the Handful of people who paid a lot of money to have like a room the size of this room as opposed to a cot and a Tiny jail cell because people don't spend any time in the rooms.

277
00:16:51,071 --> 00:16:52,555
Scott: I'm food in the tiny room.

278
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:58,740
Scott: So the staff are Delivering special meals, but the staff are allowed to move around but you're stuck in your room because the staff.

279
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:05,560
Rym: I heard the staff quarantine because the staff are Outboard people who are brought in who are definitely not sick and are wearing protective gear.

280
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:09,214
Scott: So the people who were staff on the boat are generally also quarantined.

281
00:17:09,253 --> 00:17:14,740
Scott: quarantine staff quarters Yeah, so the captain is quarantined and yet they brought in like an alternate captain.

282
00:17:16,064 --> 00:17:19,140
Rym: All I know is the reality is the disease could be on stuff.

283
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:22,773
Scott: So even if you like let's say not really not not I don't think you.

284
00:17:22,914 --> 00:17:24,380
Rym: do you know anything about the coronavirus?

285
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:28,555
Scott: the captain was sick and now the captain's quarantined in the captain's cabin.

286
00:17:28,896 --> 00:17:35,240
Scott: and now a temporary captain comes in from the outside who definitely isn't sick and is touching the ship's wheel that the captain coughed all.

287
00:17:35,381 --> 00:17:36,226
Rym: Probably okay.

288
00:17:36,749 --> 00:17:47,700
Rym: Okay, probably okay It's you can touch that you can touch the ship's wheel the so like some of the ships are like Rotating passengers like certain people can go up to the deck for like a half hour just to like walk around a little bit.

289
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,736
Rym: Then they're locked back in their room.

290
00:17:49,781 --> 00:17:55,656
Rym: So it's basically a living hell from what I can gather which just reinforces the idea that

291
00:17:55,937 --> 00:17:57,611
Scott: never going cruises now It was already

292
00:17:57,651 --> 00:18:04,828
Rym: my plan The only cruises I would ever consider are the ones that are like in the Mediterranean that just take you to a bunch of cities But never ever ever.

293
00:18:04,888 --> 00:18:13,138
Rym: the cruise that is a bunch of like Boring people go out to the middle of the ocean and just stand a Marriott for a week like a Princess cruise or whatever.

294
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:18,228
Rym: Yeah So, uh, yeah, that's all happening In some other news.

295
00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:19,879
Rym: that's kind of a crazy story.

296
00:18:20,502 --> 00:18:23,031
Rym: So I oh I got to talk about it because it was just such a weird thing.

297
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:28,377
Rym: So there's the pediatrician Okay in America and he committed suicide.

298
00:18:28,417 --> 00:18:28,920
Rym: That's tragic.

299
00:18:29,562 --> 00:18:33,920
Rym: He was beloved by the children who and the families who used him.

300
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,027
Scott: So it was like it was like the best doctor in town.

301
00:18:36,088 --> 00:18:37,814
Scott: Everyone loved them and then they killed.

302
00:18:37,834 --> 00:18:51,197
Rym: he was an anti-vaxxer who Apparently now that his suicide note came out had been faking Vaccinations for anti-vax parents so that they could send their kids dangerously and illegally to school for like a decade.

303
00:18:51,638 --> 00:19:02,039
Rym: Mm-hmm Even worse he might have been giving parents who weren't anti-vax Fake vet like giving their kids fake vaccines because he disagreed with vaccinations so much.

304
00:19:02,962 --> 00:19:19,073
Rym: So now there's this tiny public health crisis because basically any family who used this doctor either might not have immunizations because they're a crazy dangerous family or Might not have immunizations because the doctor was crazy and lied to them.

305
00:19:19,093 --> 00:19:19,715
Rym: Mm-hmm.

306
00:19:19,776 --> 00:19:20,900
Scott: Why did the doctor kill themselves?

307
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,625
Scott: Was it related to?

308
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:22,977
Rym: this seems unrelated?

309
00:19:23,118 --> 00:19:29,951
Scott: Okay The doctor seems crazy and apparently well, this is actually a thing I remember when I was in summer camp.

310
00:19:30,011 --> 00:19:33,830
Scott: right when you work in a summer camp something, you know It's like think about at work, right?

311
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:35,680
Scott: You always get sexual harassment trainings at work.

312
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,559
Scott: Oh, yeah, when you work in a summer camp, they give you spot the pedophile training.

313
00:19:39,993 --> 00:19:41,364
Scott: Yeah Because that's super.

314
00:19:41,424 --> 00:19:46,700
Scott: a lot of people go to work at summer camps because they're pedophiles and a chance to be a relit.

315
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,908
Scott: You know people come and bring their children to you.

316
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:52,040
Scott: I mean, I'm super bad plays their pedophiles to me.

317
00:19:52,261 --> 00:19:57,080
Rym: I've gotten spot the person who is about to pass out because they're too drunk training, right?

318
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:08,297
Scott: and basically the description that they give you of someone to watch out for is the person who is like Super too friendly super too.

319
00:20:08,337 --> 00:20:15,408
Scott: Nice right the kind of the kind the kind of description that matches like Popsicles.

320
00:20:15,489 --> 00:20:16,258
Scott: no, not like that.

321
00:20:16,824 --> 00:20:18,460
Scott: That's an obviously creepy person, right?

322
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:43,250
Scott: But this just I remember the description that they gave and this is at least two different trainings of different people was like my imagining would be like, you know, like a like a nega Ned Flanders like a super friendly kind of person is the kind of attitude that the kind of person who is a Pedophile going to a summer camp would cut what is likely to have that sort of personality To where you would never suspect it was them.

323
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:45,640
Scott: They were the friendliest nicest person.

324
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,999
Scott: That's how come people get close to them right you when you that right?

325
00:20:49,700 --> 00:21:06,915
Scott: So it's no surprise that other sorts of crazy people anti-vax type people right just cuz you're wrong or dangerous or bad has no effect on your Friendliness or niceness or how close people, you know, in fact, you know cult leaders, right?

326
00:21:06,955 --> 00:21:07,898
Scott: It's like how it works.

327
00:21:08,259 --> 00:21:17,186
Scott: So You know, I don't judge people based on their their niceness friendliness and such Negatively or positively right.

328
00:21:17,246 --> 00:21:21,480
Scott: I can assume that someone's a pedophile or a cult leader or an anti-vaxxer because they're too friendly.

329
00:21:22,082 --> 00:21:26,978
Scott: But I'm just saying there's no relation between that and what the person's really up to.

330
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:40,220
Rym: so The other interesting thing is it seems like a lot of the people who went to this doctor It was like an open secret among the anti-vaxxer community that that was the doctor to go to to get everything faked.

331
00:21:40,621 --> 00:21:46,397
Rym: Yeah, so I feel like we also need a way for people cuz they're like.

332
00:21:46,417 --> 00:21:50,639
Rym: they interviewed a bunch of people went to the Doctor and one mother was like I knew something was up with that fucko.

333
00:21:51,003 --> 00:21:59,040
Rym: basically, like You need any doctor who expresses like homeopathy interest should probably be like removed from doctoring.

334
00:21:59,201 --> 00:22:01,639
Scott: There's a lot of things you had to do, but we're not doing them.

335
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,500
Scott: Yeah, is that so far down the list of fucked up broken shit?

336
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,185
Scott: Yeah, because right now I'm is the bigger.

337
00:22:06,225 --> 00:22:07,410
Scott: you're fucked up broken shit.

338
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:09,698
Scott: that let's say you have something big.

339
00:22:09,738 --> 00:22:10,240
Scott: that's fucked up.

340
00:22:10,461 --> 00:22:11,644
Scott: Like I don't know.

341
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:15,636
Scott: you spilled a hot soup all over your fucking kitchen.

342
00:22:15,676 --> 00:22:16,960
Scott: The whole floor is hot soup, right?

343
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,625
Rym: I got a deal with that like right now.

344
00:22:18,866 --> 00:22:22,680
Scott: Well now let's say a hundred small things break elsewhere in your apartment.

345
00:22:23,144 --> 00:22:25,300
Scott: They ain't getting fixed cuz you're dealing with the hot soup.

346
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:31,020
Scott: So right we have this major brokenness going on in our country and world.

347
00:22:31,261 --> 00:22:36,943
Scott: We spilled fascism all over the kitchen floor right clap, you know climate changes Fascism diseases right that.

348
00:22:39,002 --> 00:22:43,260
Scott: This so that the number of small broken things is increasing exponentially.

349
00:22:43,502 --> 00:22:45,640
Scott: No one is fixing them because you can't you don't have time.

350
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:53,419
Rym: So like as much as I still think anyone who practices chiropractic should be charged with fraud And it should not be allowed to be practiced anywhere in the United States.

351
00:22:53,963 --> 00:23:07,858
Rym: That is the least of my concerns right now And I'm not gonna be an activist for can for banning chiropractic and homeopathy And all that nonsense until we get rid of the fascists At least in some better news.

352
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:12,894
Rym: Scott won't watch the show because he doesn't watch live-action television in the United States ever.

353
00:23:13,256 --> 00:23:17,410
Rym: but the good place Which only had four seasons was a fantastic show.

354
00:23:17,872 --> 00:23:18,273
Rym: it ended.

355
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:20,300
Rym: It was the exact right number of seasons.

356
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,385
Rym: It didn't go on too long.

357
00:23:21,686 --> 00:23:32,062
Rym: And all I will say is if you did not watch the show and don't know anything about it It is extremely Extremely extremely adjacent to one particular Culture book.

358
00:23:33,266 --> 00:23:36,716
Rym: it is a sci-fi and it is really good.

359
00:23:36,736 --> 00:23:38,280
Scott: I thought it was about like heaven.

360
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,967
Scott: That's why it's the good place and also hell.

361
00:23:40,569 --> 00:23:42,738
Scott: Uh, yeah, so that's all I know about it.

362
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:46,713
Scott: It basically and I know that this TV show called the house.

363
00:23:46,733 --> 00:23:47,937
Rym: I'll tell you the act.

364
00:23:48,058 --> 00:23:48,640
Rym: I won't spoil.

365
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,847
Scott: That's literally all I know.

366
00:23:50,108 --> 00:23:50,993
Rym: So here's the real plot.

367
00:23:51,074 --> 00:23:56,110
Rym: someone wakes up In like this weird room and it says everything's fine.

368
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:58,297
Rym: They're like what and this person is like.

369
00:23:58,337 --> 00:24:03,051
Rym: so you're dead and Congratulations, you're in the good place.

370
00:24:03,392 --> 00:24:04,195
Scott: Or are you really?

371
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:05,580
Scott: I've seen that Twilight Zone episode.

372
00:24:05,921 --> 00:24:07,829
Rym: Oh, so the twist is so.

373
00:24:07,889 --> 00:24:09,978
Rym: it's heaven like it's everything's great for a while.

374
00:24:10,078 --> 00:24:10,219
Rym: Sure.

375
00:24:10,239 --> 00:24:10,440
Scott: It's not.

376
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,087
Rym: Well, I've seen the whole thing.

377
00:24:12,569 --> 00:24:13,453
Rym: It's four seasons law.

378
00:24:13,634 --> 00:24:15,060
Scott: Well, tell me is it the Twilight Zone episode?

379
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:15,904
Scott: We're just kidding.

380
00:24:15,945 --> 00:24:16,267
Scott: It's hell.

381
00:24:16,387 --> 00:24:18,360
Rym: It's actually way more complicated than you might think.

382
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:24,938
Rym: Okay, but at the end of the episode the twist is basically the person who were introduced to the main character.

383
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:33,060
Rym: the whole time Goes to another character and is like so yeah I'm not the person that that angel said I am and I definitely don't belong here.

384
00:24:33,321 --> 00:24:39,742
Rym: So something's fucked up and everyone else clearly belongs there and it's either a mistake or something They don't know.

385
00:24:39,842 --> 00:24:44,780
Scott: so like I guess the equivalent of you know, the I don't forget which Saint is at the gate, whatever.

386
00:24:44,961 --> 00:24:46,920
Rym: Yeah, the main carrot the main I don't know too much.

387
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,886
Scott: You know Jews don't know much about this.

388
00:24:48,947 --> 00:24:51,254
Rym: the main angels name is Michael like.

389
00:24:51,375 --> 00:24:52,940
Rym: it's okay on point there.

390
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:58,386
Scott: The point is they fucked up somehow and let someone in who is bad Yep, and then what happens?

391
00:24:58,527 --> 00:25:00,534
Rym: and the show would impress me about it.

392
00:25:00,555 --> 00:25:01,960
Scott: You can't imagine too much would happen.

393
00:25:02,061 --> 00:25:04,059
Scott: It would just be a bad person having a good time.

394
00:25:04,326 --> 00:25:07,886
Rym: So yeah That's why it's only four seasons like Any four seasons.

395
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:10,260
Scott: to tell that you think you should limit it to like the 30 minute twice.

396
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:16,046
Scott: Well because the cool thing about this show I do get and you should also make two episodes bad guy gets Into heaven and good guy goes to hell.

397
00:25:16,206 --> 00:25:17,813
Scott: the good guy goes to hell's way.

398
00:25:17,853 --> 00:25:18,175
Scott: sad.

399
00:25:18,215 --> 00:25:19,340
Scott: Don't make that never mind.

400
00:25:19,844 --> 00:25:21,320
Scott: So the bad guy goes to heaven one.

401
00:25:21,581 --> 00:25:27,720
Rym: So there is a revelation at one point that the person that heaven thought this other person was is in the bad place.

402
00:25:27,981 --> 00:25:32,418
Rym: Oh, so now the bad person has a has to decide what to do about that.

403
00:25:33,042 --> 00:25:35,098
Scott: uh-oh, and why would the bad?

404
00:25:35,259 --> 00:25:35,340
Scott: just?

405
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,705
Scott: There's a literal God.

406
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:38,728
Scott: God could just fucking fix it.

407
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:44,851
Rym: Ah, so much like Gnostic Christianity You never see a god you only see the angels.

408
00:25:44,891 --> 00:25:46,879
Rym: more like a Mettaton situation could still fix it.

409
00:25:47,341 --> 00:25:48,946
Rym: Well, yeah, the show is about that.

410
00:25:49,528 --> 00:25:57,821
Rym: But my point is that in ghost writer going to hell and fight demons enough times It's a show That was made in America with live-action Actors.

411
00:25:57,861 --> 00:26:04,200
Rym: that is a serial but it ends when it's done as opposed to going on for ten more seasons or ending before it resolved.

412
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:07,236
Scott: Everybody well now knowing more than one sentence about it.

413
00:26:07,296 --> 00:26:15,657
Scott: I like it less All right, the other interesting thing about it is after you watch couple episodes unless you tell me this parts where this ghost writer fighting Demons, then I'm gonna watch it.

414
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:21,380
Scott: Yeah All I'll say about is that everybody and I don't see ghost writer fighting demons and that's a new ten a horse lie.

415
00:26:22,003 --> 00:26:25,220
Scott: Then I'll kill you literally every time I can send you to the bad place.

416
00:26:25,401 --> 00:26:27,953
Rym: Okay, I think I know where this show is going.

417
00:26:27,993 --> 00:26:37,459
Rym: Like I see what they're doing there it would do a 180 or a 90 degree swerve off into something that I Literally would never have expected and I feel stupid for not having not seen it.

418
00:26:38,225 --> 00:26:39,616
Rym: The last thing I'll say about it.

419
00:26:39,737 --> 00:26:52,152
Rym: Is that Shows like this mostly looking at you Star Trek Tend to have a very human centric like human sensibility focused area where they could do something Way transhumanist and weird.

420
00:26:52,394 --> 00:26:55,967
Rym: right this show Goes into the transhumanist direction.

421
00:26:56,187 --> 00:26:57,230
Rym: Oh, I did not expect.

422
00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:58,393
Scott: I like it slightly more.

423
00:26:58,413 --> 00:27:04,715
Rym: now that I was so happy that That was a direction this show went that I cannot recommend the show enough.

424
00:27:04,836 --> 00:27:06,484
Rym: It is phenomenal Mm-hmm.

425
00:27:06,645 --> 00:27:08,053
Rym: It is some of the best American TV.

426
00:27:08,073 --> 00:27:09,080
Rym: I've seen forever.

427
00:27:10,361 --> 00:27:13,110
Rym: It is easily seen on the high seas.

428
00:27:13,311 --> 00:27:19,833
Rym: I guess there's a legal way to watch it, but I couldn't figure out a way to Netflix show or it's not like NBC.

429
00:27:20,376 --> 00:27:21,983
Rym: Oh That the crazy thing is.

430
00:27:22,043 --> 00:27:24,291
Rym: it's like broadcast TV yet.

431
00:27:24,311 --> 00:27:26,016
Rym: It was a serious good show.

432
00:27:26,036 --> 00:27:27,060
Scott: We'll watch it without ads.

433
00:27:27,582 --> 00:27:29,450
Scott: Yeah, I read anyone who watched it on NBC.

434
00:27:29,751 --> 00:27:33,399
Rym: Yeah, I think like the first seasons on Netflix It must be on one of the things.

435
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,948
Rym: Yeah, you can go to the high seas for the rest.

436
00:27:34,968 --> 00:27:37,020
Scott: I'm sure the NBC.com has it somewhere, right?

437
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:42,600
Scott: But even if it cost money I highly recommend you log in with your someone's cable account like your mom's cable account and then watch it.

438
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:43,724
Rym: I'll never forget.

439
00:27:44,006 --> 00:27:47,280
Rym: my favorite thing that Dorkly ever did was every time they said HBO.

440
00:27:47,662 --> 00:27:53,065
Rym: They never they'd like to define replace in every script or any character ever in any show They made ever said the word HBO.

441
00:27:53,286 --> 00:27:56,195
Rym: I've always changed it to my mom's HBO go account.

442
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:56,576
Rym: Mm-hmm.

443
00:27:57,078 --> 00:28:06,177
Rym: That's right but anyway things Of the day.

444
00:28:06,358 --> 00:28:08,669
Rym: I got two cuz they're just too good and too short.

445
00:28:09,552 --> 00:28:14,526
Rym: Number one, there is a photograph making the rounds cuz it won a wildlife photography award.

446
00:28:15,007 --> 00:28:15,509
Scott: It is a fire.

447
00:28:15,529 --> 00:28:16,592
Scott: every year They give this award.

448
00:28:16,673 --> 00:28:17,656
Scott: It's always a good photo.

449
00:28:17,736 --> 00:28:21,970
Rym: This is the best photo I have ever seen from that series.

450
00:28:22,712 --> 00:28:29,953
Rym: It is just like amazingly framed photograph of two mice having a fight on a subway platform Mm-hmm.

451
00:28:30,618 --> 00:28:33,073
Rym: It is like this photo is just Perfect.

452
00:28:33,133 --> 00:28:42,450
Scott: so really the the thing about this photo I think that makes it Like throttling the other one right is that you look at the how they got the focus, right?

453
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:47,770
Scott: You can see that the the shot had such a net, you know a narrow field of young, right?

454
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:52,930
Scott: But they managed, you know narrow depth of field, but they managed to get those tiny mice in focus.

455
00:28:53,111 --> 00:28:55,950
Scott: But meanwhile everything behind and in front is out of focus.

456
00:28:56,010 --> 00:29:02,880
Scott: The only thing that's in the same distance from the camera as the mice is like this bench to the left And even that's still a little bit closer.

457
00:29:03,262 --> 00:29:04,970
Scott: so that pulls like you're complete.

458
00:29:05,211 --> 00:29:08,663
Scott: Your eyes are just completely drawn to the mice and the mice only even better.

459
00:29:08,683 --> 00:29:13,883
Scott: and the rest of the frame is just like letting You know, yeah This is in a subway station of some kind and even better.

460
00:29:13,944 --> 00:29:16,256
Rym: if you zoom in or look at it I can't even tell you where.

461
00:29:16,277 --> 00:29:17,444
Scott: I can just tell you it's not in New York.

462
00:29:17,585 --> 00:29:18,470
Rym: It's the London Underground.

463
00:29:18,732 --> 00:29:19,798
Rym: Okay, you can do.

464
00:29:19,859 --> 00:29:20,744
Rym: I see the logo there.

465
00:29:21,106 --> 00:29:24,350
Rym: Oh, there it is But actually the bench is slightly more in focus than the mice.

466
00:29:24,773 --> 00:29:27,190
Rym: But that actually makes if you zoom in and like look at it in detail.

467
00:29:27,672 --> 00:29:32,230
Rym: But that almost makes it better because it really puts into stark contrast how tiny the mice are.

468
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:35,381
Scott: Well the tiny but the contrast is really from.

469
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:40,797
Rym: the mice are also a black silhouette over a lighted background Because the station is is completely white.

470
00:29:40,937 --> 00:29:45,630
Scott: Yeah, well well lit much more well lit than any sort of a New York station.

471
00:29:45,838 --> 00:29:51,669
Rym: Yeah And the mice are just those new lights they put in the Vernon Jackson station that make it like.

472
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:53,881
Scott: well I guess the Hudson Yard stations bright.

473
00:29:53,901 --> 00:29:55,570
Rym: Yeah, dude, go to Vernon Jackson sometime.

474
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:56,775
Rym: They put all these new like modern.

475
00:29:56,835 --> 00:29:57,739
Scott: I always wonder what happened.

476
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:00,490
Scott: Like you think about all these stations are underground, right?

477
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:01,955
Scott: It's like there's emergency lighting.

478
00:30:01,995 --> 00:30:02,898
Scott: in case we know.

479
00:30:02,978 --> 00:30:09,010
Scott: but imagine if the lights turned out any emergency lights turned out The subway would be pitch black.

480
00:30:09,372 --> 00:30:11,081
Scott: You wouldn't see depends on which line.

481
00:30:11,141 --> 00:30:12,710
Rym: a lot of the lines are so close to the surface.

482
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:14,199
Rym: There's actually vents you don't know about.

483
00:30:14,219 --> 00:30:16,130
Rym: a lot of light leaks in some of them some of them.

484
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:20,986
Scott: But I'm saying like Hudson Yards, you will see fucking nothing if all the lights and emergency lights failed.

485
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:22,150
Scott: really black.

486
00:30:22,552 --> 00:30:24,949
Rym: Yep, you're like two seconds like oh fuck me.

487
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:29,707
Rym: Literally every 90% of the people down there have a cell phone and we'd be fine.

488
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,210
Scott: Oh, right.

489
00:30:31,312 --> 00:30:38,225
Rym: so my other thing today is a 10-second video of Some amazing Japanese slapstick comedy.

490
00:30:38,245 --> 00:30:47,682
Rym: dude Puts a harmonica in his mouth and tapes his nose shut so he can only breathe through the harmonica and his friend fucking Whales on his shin with a pot.

491
00:30:47,702 --> 00:30:51,517
Rym: Oh Yeah Watch it with the sound on.

492
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:53,830
Rym: it's funnier than it has any right to be.

493
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:56,590
Scott: Sorry to anyone who's hard of hearing and cannot appreciate this joke.

494
00:30:56,751 --> 00:31:01,949
Rym: And the moment you think it was funny and you're ready to go like watch it all the way to the end It's only 10 seconds long.

495
00:31:02,851 --> 00:31:06,606
Rym: The last second of this video is twice as funny as the rest of the video.

496
00:31:07,229 --> 00:31:09,196
Rym: Okay So what's your thing today?

497
00:31:09,538 --> 00:31:11,670
Scott: So I wanted to link directly to the thing of the day.

498
00:31:11,791 --> 00:31:14,250
Scott: But the problem is it was three different videos.

499
00:31:14,632 --> 00:31:28,377
Scott: So it's a good opportunity to branch into the meta moment a little bit Post in our forum and in that forum post I embedded the three videos to make it for easy watching and our forum is even if you don't register Publicly visible to the entire internet.

500
00:31:28,417 --> 00:31:28,657
Rym: Yep.

501
00:31:28,838 --> 00:31:30,543
Rym: Also our forums kind of rockin.

502
00:31:30,724 --> 00:31:44,530
Scott: Yes over the last weekend was the NWHL all-star game Events a lot of things going on there And so it was the speed skating competitions and all the stuff all that kind of stuff and it was broadcast for completely free on.

503
00:31:44,932 --> 00:31:47,730
Scott: You could just watch it and of course because it was on Twitch this VODs.

504
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:52,690
Scott: So if you missed it, you can go back and watch it and it came out to three VODs at the end of the day.

505
00:31:53,833 --> 00:31:55,650
Scott: So here's the three VODs in our forum.

506
00:31:55,913 --> 00:32:00,389
Scott: You can watch your one two three Conveniently without having to go to twitch and dig around or anything like that.

507
00:32:00,671 --> 00:32:03,546
Scott: Not bad, and you'll you'll end up in our forum at the same time.

508
00:32:03,949 --> 00:32:09,270
Rym: Yep I remember me and Emily were at the first championship when they gave away the Isabel Cup the first time.

509
00:32:09,651 --> 00:32:10,474
Rym: It was like it was a good time.

510
00:32:10,997 --> 00:32:11,177
Rym: We had.

511
00:32:11,217 --> 00:32:12,643
Rym: it was like standing room only.

512
00:32:12,663 --> 00:32:14,270
Scott: Well, there'll be another one soon.

513
00:32:14,491 --> 00:32:18,290
Rym: Yeah, so in the meta moment the geek knows book club book is the tale of Genji.

514
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:20,095
Rym: We're powering through it at some point.

515
00:32:20,216 --> 00:32:25,610
Scott: I'm reading right along on the train, but I worry that once bike starts I'll stop reading.

516
00:32:25,871 --> 00:32:27,479
Scott: so one thing cuz I won't be on the train.

517
00:32:27,499 --> 00:32:33,770
Rym: I was going kind of slow cuz I was trying to Be a hundred percent sure who was talking or who was being referred.

518
00:32:34,873 --> 00:32:35,756
Rym: I gave up on that shit.

519
00:32:35,837 --> 00:32:37,102
Rym: cuz I can't tell right.

520
00:32:37,162 --> 00:32:39,413
Scott: I'm at the point where it's like person I know.

521
00:32:39,514 --> 00:32:45,410
Scott: I just need I just need to know who's in the conversation And it's like, okay, these people had a conversation about this.

522
00:32:45,491 --> 00:32:47,549
Scott: I don't know which one said what and it doesn't really matter.

523
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:56,219
Rym: Yep And I've get especially when a person is referred to through like multiple layers of allegory I if I don't immediately recognize who the character is.

524
00:32:56,299 --> 00:32:57,524
Rym: I don't try to figure it out anymore.

525
00:32:57,684 --> 00:33:00,221
Rym: No unless I'm unless I get confused I just move on.

526
00:33:00,241 --> 00:33:03,938
Scott: Yeah Multiple different ways to refer to the same person.

527
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:04,340
Scott: Yeah.

528
00:33:04,701 --> 00:33:06,889
Rym: Anyway, I also started reading more about that period.

529
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:12,335
Rym: now I understand the difference between like why there's a minister of the left and the right Understand the left and the right.

530
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:16,648
Rym: still I understand it enough to read this book with a lot more context.

531
00:33:16,889 --> 00:33:19,549
Scott: basically Maybe I should research it again in the appendix.

532
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:20,654
Rym: Imagine there's.

533
00:33:20,795 --> 00:33:22,843
Rym: I'm gonna super simplify and be better wrong.

534
00:33:22,863 --> 00:33:24,610
Scott: There's an emperor says an emperor.

535
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:31,430
Rym: Yeah, because the administration is so large and complex of a nation of this size without scale without technology.

536
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:43,730
Rym: yeah coupled with a bunch of Confucianism and like Chinese government ideas that were imported and other things from the era You divide the country into two sides as an arbitrary means of administration.

537
00:33:43,971 --> 00:33:44,876
Rym: You got the left and the right.

538
00:33:45,238 --> 00:33:50,600
Rym: you have equal equivalent offices on both sides Just as a way kind of like Diocletian with the Roman Empire.

539
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,905
Rym: Like let's just split it in two.

540
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:53,230
Rym: It's kind of like that.

541
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:56,950
Rym: Okay It just so happens that I don't get it wrong.

542
00:33:57,712 --> 00:34:00,020
Rym: The people who liked Genji were on the left.

543
00:34:00,481 --> 00:34:02,408
Rym: people who didn't like Genji were on the rights.

544
00:34:02,829 --> 00:34:05,626
Rym: All right Oh, that's kind of why he gets into some shit.

545
00:34:05,686 --> 00:34:06,190
Scott: That's helpful.

546
00:34:07,153 --> 00:34:14,989
Rym: Like that actually really helped me understand what's going on, okay That's good info for me and there is a long forward in the book if you go back and read it.

547
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,841
Scott: I did read it, but it didn't help me too much.

548
00:34:16,862 --> 00:34:18,210
Scott: It explains that a little bit.

549
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:19,554
Scott: I don't remember too much either.

550
00:34:19,656 --> 00:34:23,350
Rym: go read Wikipedia articles about that era and it makes way more sense.

551
00:34:23,731 --> 00:34:26,301
Rym: All right, the forward tries to explain that but gets distracted.

552
00:34:26,321 --> 00:34:28,550
Scott: All right, so some other meta things.

553
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:31,783
Scott: So first of all, we're trying to update the technology a little bit.

554
00:34:31,822 --> 00:34:38,926
Scott: I got GeekNights onto Spotify So GeekNights is available wherever podcasts are delivered for free and even better.

555
00:34:39,005 --> 00:34:40,290
Scott: This is kind of Google Play.

556
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:44,058
Scott: We're on iTunes run Spotify every Episode of.

557
00:34:44,178 --> 00:34:45,688
Scott: yes, I went through a lot of spot.

558
00:34:46,312 --> 00:34:49,409
Scott: Lipson's really crappy, but I went through a lot of effort and harassed people.

559
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:51,938
Scott: Well, I'm gonna qualify that every episode of GeekNights.

560
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,364
Rym: I'm gonna qualify that by what.

561
00:34:53,385 --> 00:34:58,890
Rym: but Lipson is not crappy so much as We are some of the early.

562
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:00,609
Scott: They don't have an API.

563
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:03,480
Scott: They only have FTP as a means of integrating with them.

564
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,170
Rym: Well, I've realized something about podcasting in general.

565
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:11,897
Rym: Almost no one has a professional Technology pipeline for podcast.

566
00:35:11,917 --> 00:35:14,829
Scott: There's one that had a very simple API but had an API.

567
00:35:15,251 --> 00:35:18,078
Scott: Yeah, but post an episode edit an episode and delete enough.

568
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:20,024
Rym: I've seen the inside of several.

569
00:35:20,064 --> 00:35:26,590
Rym: like professional podcasting organizations Even like super pros are way less automated than we are.

570
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:28,035
Rym: It's kind of sad.

571
00:35:28,436 --> 00:35:30,181
Rym: like I think are like.

572
00:35:30,262 --> 00:35:38,006
Rym: I literally think Scott and I have a more Technologically sophisticated podcast production pipeline than almost any professional podcaster on earth.

573
00:35:38,206 --> 00:35:39,330
Scott: Anyway, that scares me.

574
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:42,181
Scott: The point is no one needs API's but us.

575
00:35:42,402 --> 00:35:50,390
Scott: You're listening to you nights already, but it's everywhere Right, and I will take this opportunity to if you notice any technical problems because of the changes I made.

576
00:35:50,591 --> 00:35:55,270
Rym: Yeah, like maybe this episode won't go up cuz the last episode didn't go up right away on the feed.

577
00:35:55,351 --> 00:35:56,861
Rym: It went up everywhere, but the fee.

578
00:35:56,881 --> 00:36:02,904
Scott: Yeah, there are some problems but In case you notice any problems, that's because if we're working on stuff, we'll fix it quickly.

579
00:36:02,984 --> 00:36:03,185
Scott: Yep.

580
00:36:03,346 --> 00:36:04,309
Scott: We're keeping an eye on it.

581
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:08,170
Rym: We're the middle of kind of a big upgrade of our tech stack in general.

582
00:36:08,351 --> 00:36:12,026
Scott: I'll just remind you of all the different places that you can find GeekNights stuff.

583
00:36:12,066 --> 00:36:12,809
Scott: We got Twitter's.

584
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:15,139
Scott: Yep, we got two different youtubes.

585
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,550
Scott: Yeah, I think he rims YouTube in my youtube.

586
00:36:18,032 --> 00:36:22,210
Rym: Yeah, we got a patreon which is both a backup for the main show.

587
00:36:22,311 --> 00:36:23,239
Rym: You can always listen there.

588
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:27,270
Rym: and I want to point out Almost everything we post to the patreon is free.

589
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:29,870
Rym: Like you don't need to give us any money to access any of that stuff.

590
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:31,778
Scott: You can go to the patreon without paying.

591
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:33,064
Scott: if you do pay you'll get.

592
00:36:33,284 --> 00:36:34,088
Scott: you'll give Rym money.

593
00:36:34,128 --> 00:36:34,550
Scott: Don't do that?

594
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,096
Rym: Yeah, you also get some custom stuff.

595
00:36:36,116 --> 00:36:37,079
Rym: you get some Rym's rants.

596
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:39,006
Rym: you get some really reviews you get.

597
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:46,430
Rym: for example We did a panel that we didn't video at magfest and I posted the audio of that panel and the slides stuff like that.

598
00:36:47,811 --> 00:36:51,588
Scott: Yeah, we got an Instagram that I'm trying to use, you know, we got pretty much everywhere.

599
00:36:51,628 --> 00:36:52,030
Scott: There's a thing.

600
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:56,247
Scott: We got a thing and we have a discord and we got the forum on our website.

601
00:36:56,267 --> 00:36:56,950
Scott: Don't forget that one.

602
00:36:57,011 --> 00:36:58,568
Scott: I just mentioned it in the thing of the day part.

603
00:36:59,553 --> 00:37:03,870
Scott: We got discord that was made by a listener and we were kind of a on discord.

604
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:07,039
Scott: But now it's like well, I guess whatever right?

605
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:16,497
Rym: Well because all the other things that could do a discord did died anyway, so Yeah, that's basically you know, the unofficial.

606
00:37:16,517 --> 00:37:18,863
Scott: It's the unofficial official GeekNights discord.

607
00:37:18,943 --> 00:37:22,793
Scott: Yep, and what I found out was You know, oh we got.

608
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:27,990
Scott: I got twitch also, but there's um, when you want to stream video games on YouTube twitch, right?

609
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:30,702
Scott: It's it's kind of like a hassle, right?

610
00:37:30,723 --> 00:37:32,210
Scott: You got to set up all kinds of stuff.

611
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:33,988
Scott: You gotta use OBS you get all the stuff.

612
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:39,710
Scott: What happens is when you have discord installed and open if you start a video game?

613
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:46,690
Scott: Just launch a video game on Steam or anywhere this gorgeous pops up and is like hey, bro I see you're playing a video game.

614
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:56,496
Scott: You want to stream that on discord and you literally not even exaggerating you push one fucking button Just one button and just say yes And it immediately boom.

615
00:37:56,696 --> 00:38:06,710
Scott: that game that you're playing is now streaming in a discord channel on the server Right and anyone and I think up to however many people can fit into a discord.

616
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:16,470
Scott: You know audio chat room can come into that chat room and watch the game that you're streaming and also Chat if they got microphones or listen if they got speakers or headphones.

617
00:38:17,937 --> 00:38:24,910
Scott: and since you know Less people are gonna find you this way if you do this because obviously you're not listed on Twitch or YouTube or anywhere.

618
00:38:25,652 --> 00:38:33,232
Scott: But it's so convenient and easy to do so low effort that I've been doing it because it's just like I'm playing a game on My PC.

619
00:38:33,714 --> 00:38:38,250
Scott: might as well click one fucking button and then oh look listeners happen to pop in and chat.

620
00:38:38,471 --> 00:38:40,904
Scott: Okay, and it's a small number of people.

621
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:42,050
Scott: so it's totally easy to handle.

622
00:38:42,171 --> 00:38:56,660
Scott: So you should go to the GeekNights official unofficial discord And maybe you'll see a little pop-up sign when I'm streaming a game or someone else's and you can come in chat And you can't find the GeekNights official unofficial discord.

623
00:38:57,161 --> 00:38:59,930
Scott: go the GeekNights forum and ask around to find links to it.

624
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:03,270
Rym: Yep, I'm gonna link to a bunch of this stuff in this post for this episode.

625
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:06,164
Scott: It's open to pretty much anyone but then if you're bad you'll get banned.

626
00:39:06,606 --> 00:39:17,570
Rym: So don't be bad Yep, and a lesson least like I don't have to tell you that you got to vote for Democrats in every election if you're an American like basically until or see if the foreseeable future.

627
00:39:17,771 --> 00:39:22,225
Scott: In fact, if you are not an American, you should find a way to illegally vote for Democrats.

628
00:39:22,345 --> 00:39:29,497
Scott: Yeah, and if you are any human being you should find a way to Illegally rig the election for Democrats.

629
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:32,590
Rym: I mean now apparently it's not illegal to rig our election.

630
00:39:33,112 --> 00:39:39,378
Scott: They voted against all these election security laws, which means The election is not going to be secure.

631
00:39:39,799 --> 00:39:42,750
Scott: So it is our moral duty to rig it in favor of the good.

632
00:39:43,071 --> 00:39:44,536
Scott: Yep, so not even joking.

633
00:39:44,817 --> 00:39:47,990
Scott: I want to remind everyone that back in I go to jail just for suggesting it.

634
00:39:48,191 --> 00:39:48,696
Rym: I don't know.

635
00:39:48,797 --> 00:39:49,788
Scott: free speech deal with it.

636
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:59,045
Rym: So back in May of last year the editorial board of GeekNights unanimously voted Meeting or meeting Scott and I said Warren.

637
00:39:59,367 --> 00:40:03,394
Rym: Yeah, Warren We endorsed Warren like we Do believe.

638
00:40:03,454 --> 00:40:09,110
Rym: Elizabeth Warren is the most qualified candidate in the Democrat field and we want her to be president.

639
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:14,166
Scott: She is still running if I just decide who of all the people on earth who would be president?

640
00:40:14,427 --> 00:40:15,330
Scott: that is who I would pick.

641
00:40:15,531 --> 00:40:18,610
Scott: Yeah, it is not to say that other candidates aren't also great.

642
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:21,901
Scott: It's like, you know, all these Bernie people are like super anti.

643
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:24,048
Scott: everyone else's like, you know, what Bernie is like.

644
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:24,329
Scott: close.

645
00:40:24,349 --> 00:40:26,541
Scott: second I'll take a old Jewish guy.

646
00:40:26,762 --> 00:40:32,430
Rym: I'll take gonna be a old Jewish Literally any Democrat except Tulsi Gabbard because I think she's a Russian spy, right?

647
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:36,530
Scott: It's like, you know, I'm not a fan of you know, Biden or him.

648
00:40:37,276 --> 00:40:38,850
Rym: Hold my nose and I'll vote for it.

649
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:41,095
Scott: But it's like I'll take it.

650
00:40:41,696 --> 00:40:43,321
Rym: I'll take anything blue.

651
00:40:43,341 --> 00:40:45,026
Rym: No matter you vote for the Democrats.

652
00:40:45,106 --> 00:40:47,858
Scott: I literally don't starving I'll eat the fucking McDonald's.

653
00:40:47,938 --> 00:40:50,030
Scott: Yeah, I just want you know, I had enough poison.

654
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:55,650
Scott: McDonald's is at least not Literal poison, it's just you know metaphorical poison.

655
00:40:55,831 --> 00:41:08,039
Rym: But the point I really want to make is we endorsed Warren but like in the end I'm gonna vote for any Democrat because we're in a literal crisis, but I want to point out something very clear if you don't Join a party in the United States.

656
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:14,830
Scott: You don't matter at all like nothing man I know if they know influence a lot of people, you know, it's like I used to think this way.

657
00:41:14,911 --> 00:41:16,630
Rym: So I understand a lot of people think this way.

658
00:41:17,031 --> 00:41:17,975
Rym: It's easy to use this.

659
00:41:18,076 --> 00:41:20,867
Scott: I used to follow this line of thinking where it's like I'll be independent.

660
00:41:20,887 --> 00:41:22,875
Scott: cuz I'm independent I hate the party system.

661
00:41:22,936 --> 00:41:24,101
Scott: The party system is bullshit.

662
00:41:24,442 --> 00:41:25,065
Scott: I still believe.

663
00:41:25,105 --> 00:41:26,190
Rym: I do believe that right?

664
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:31,810
Scott: So I'm gonna be independent and I'll just vote for the person that I think is best in the general election.

665
00:41:32,131 --> 00:41:33,638
Scott: Fuck your party bullshit, right?

666
00:41:33,799 --> 00:41:36,410
Rym: But one party is always the worst party, right?

667
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:42,768
Scott: But what the literal thing that happens is pretty much in the vast majority of places in the country, right?

668
00:41:45,114 --> 00:41:46,022
Scott: One party just wins.

669
00:41:46,305 --> 00:41:46,789
Scott: in New York.

670
00:41:47,555 --> 00:41:53,310
Scott: You can't win if you're in the Republican Party Which means the at your vote in the general does not matter, right?

671
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:54,232
Scott: You need to.

672
00:41:54,252 --> 00:41:56,439
Scott: the primary is where you're actually choosing the person.

673
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,150
Scott: So even if you join a party, that's not your party, right?

674
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:02,002
Scott: Maybe you're a fascist Republican.

675
00:42:02,022 --> 00:42:07,970
Scott: if you live in New York You should join the Democratic Party because then you're actually going to be choosing who's going to win.

676
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:13,665
Scott: You can choose the more right-wing Democrat and your vote will actually have an impact on who gets elected.

677
00:42:14,026 --> 00:42:21,450
Scott: if you just stay a Republican In New York and keep voting for whoever the fuck fascist they put out there You're not gonna win and you're it's pointless.

678
00:42:21,852 --> 00:42:27,457
Rym: So what I guess what I would say is that the the sink way to put this is Voting is not like this moral choice.

679
00:42:27,477 --> 00:42:31,128
Rym: Like you're not rooting for someone before act way voting is very simple.

680
00:42:31,168 --> 00:42:33,756
Rym: in the u.s There are two power seeking coalitions.

681
00:42:34,117 --> 00:42:40,338
Rym: you pick which one you want to have influence over and then you pick which one You would like to see in power.

682
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:42,650
Rym: That is the only choice you actually have right?

683
00:42:42,731 --> 00:42:53,810
Scott: I saw people who were like, you know, the you know Their principles right align with Bernie and the principles don't align with anyone else Right, and I get one is crazy because they overlap like 90%.

684
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:56,770
Scott: No, no, all right, but I'm saying that what that's what that person believes, right?

685
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:57,232
Scott: Is there?

686
00:42:57,352 --> 00:43:01,090
Scott: they're they're against the other people for principled reasons, right?

687
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:06,753
Scott: But the point is it's like okay you will you know seek power Right.

688
00:43:06,773 --> 00:43:17,630
Scott: Yeah, if that person and if that if it's not that person you're not going to seek power That means your your principle is now unrepresented in the government, which is much worse.

689
00:43:17,891 --> 00:43:22,666
Rym: Yep, then right voting for the Green Party is literally saying I don't give a fuck.

690
00:43:23,107 --> 00:43:23,910
Rym: Yeah who gets hurt?

691
00:43:25,071 --> 00:43:26,576
Scott: It's like you're just like you're saying.

692
00:43:26,596 --> 00:43:28,261
Scott: I believe my vote doesn't matter.

693
00:43:28,322 --> 00:43:30,970
Scott: So I'll make it matter even less out of spite.

694
00:43:31,492 --> 00:43:32,093
Scott: Yeah, right.

695
00:43:32,535 --> 00:43:33,939
Rym: So there's two coalitions.

696
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:37,430
Rym: pick the one that's closest to what you are seeking power.

697
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:40,681
Scott: Your vote is literal power right that you have.

698
00:43:40,741 --> 00:43:41,684
Scott: it's the power you have.

699
00:43:41,704 --> 00:43:46,640
Rym: Yeah to do anything political You want like a far-left radical join the Democrats.

700
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:48,084
Scott: you don't you don't vote.

701
00:43:48,124 --> 00:43:50,210
Scott: you are not exerting that power at all.

702
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:50,852
Scott: You're you're.

703
00:43:51,032 --> 00:43:56,750
Scott: you're failing to use your power to move the world your tiny piece of strength, right?

704
00:43:57,450 --> 00:44:02,047
Scott: It's like the tug-of-war and you're just looking at the rope and you're just not pulling either side.

705
00:44:02,408 --> 00:44:07,830
Scott: It's like Okay, well then you Didn't do anything to move it one way or the other.

706
00:44:08,172 --> 00:44:11,409
Scott: Yeah, so now you can't complain about which way it moved at the end.

707
00:44:12,256 --> 00:44:23,385
Rym: So getting into the main bit Cleaning is something that I tried to avoid doing for most of my life Or only did certain kinds of cleaning and not other kind.

708
00:44:23,506 --> 00:44:33,629
Rym: Yeah, like Until I was an adult in my own apartment I don't think I had ever once even considered the idea that the molding needed to be dusted.

709
00:44:33,649 --> 00:44:34,794
Scott: Yeah I own that still.

710
00:44:35,195 --> 00:44:37,062
Rym: I die die die rarely dusts.

711
00:44:37,343 --> 00:44:42,548
Scott: Yeah, and I don't debt when I do dust I don't dust all the things as certain things too hard to dust.

712
00:44:42,729 --> 00:44:43,735
Rym: Yep well, what's?

713
00:44:43,775 --> 00:44:51,190
Rym: it was so I was thinking about this partly because recently I We bought a bunch of new furniture and got rid of much old stuff and like I'm gonna read jiggering a lot of the apartment.

714
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:59,150
Rym: So I took apart the entire bedroom Deep cleaned it and put it all back together and then it did the same thing for the gig night studio.

715
00:44:59,291 --> 00:45:01,160
Rym: Like I took my entire desk apart.

716
00:45:01,402 --> 00:45:02,970
Rym: I pulled every cable out from under there.

717
00:45:03,311 --> 00:45:08,685
Rym: I put cable routing channels everywhere and while I was doing that I liked it a full deep clean.

718
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:09,207
Rym: Mm-hmm.

719
00:45:10,049 --> 00:45:11,637
Rym: So What's your buddy?

720
00:45:11,697 --> 00:45:13,989
Rym: Well, like what's your daily cleaning routine?

721
00:45:15,717 --> 00:45:19,098
Scott: Clean on a daily Daily weekly monthly yearly.

722
00:45:19,118 --> 00:45:25,970
Scott: Well, I mean I should do dishes more daily But what ends up happening is they pile a bit and then I do them.

723
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:27,916
Scott: So I do them a few times a week.

724
00:45:27,956 --> 00:45:29,340
Scott: a dishwasher dishwasher helps.

725
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,306
Rym: Yeah, I but the dishwasher does 95% of my dishes.

726
00:45:32,551 --> 00:45:37,282
Rym: Yeah, yeah, but I mean I don't run it every day No, but I put everything in the dishwasher as soon as I'm done with it.

727
00:45:37,302 --> 00:45:42,539
Rym: I mean sometimes yeah, oh 100% I never leave dirty stuff out Unless the dishwasher is already full of clean stuff.

728
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:48,322
Rym: as soon as I break the seal on the clean dishwasher Everything that dishwasher gets put away and dirty stuff immediately goes into it.

729
00:45:48,382 --> 00:45:50,330
Scott: Yeah, I just gotta have time to time to do it.

730
00:45:50,772 --> 00:45:52,359
Scott: Sometimes it's like don't got time.

731
00:45:52,379 --> 00:45:57,782
Rym: It takes less than Four seconds to put something dirty in the dishwasher.

732
00:45:58,446 --> 00:45:59,310
Rym: You don't have four seconds.

733
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:04,550
Scott: Sometimes you know I go and I sit at a table and I eat and then I don't even bring the plates to the kitchen.

734
00:46:05,491 --> 00:46:09,348
Scott: Wow, okay Later on I'll go collect everything.

735
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:14,129
Rym: Explains a lot about when we live together in colony.

736
00:46:15,752 --> 00:46:16,496
Scott: Clean it eventually.

737
00:46:16,537 --> 00:46:18,570
Scott: That's not like it goes to the point where it's like a problem.

738
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:21,350
Scott: It's just you know, I'll clean it the next day or the day after.

739
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:22,376
Rym: Alright, so is there any?

740
00:46:22,416 --> 00:46:24,186
Rym: because I sweep the apartment every day.

741
00:46:24,206 --> 00:46:26,430
Rym: No Well, I do a quick not like a deep.

742
00:46:26,871 --> 00:46:31,770
Scott: When Wendy carpet is looking meh and like it looks like there's all I get because like the carpets easier to see.

743
00:46:32,392 --> 00:46:38,317
Scott: So if it looks like there's a bunch of garbage on the carpet, then I'll vacuum all the floor Not just the carpet all the floor.

744
00:46:38,679 --> 00:46:39,523
Rym: All right carpet.

745
00:46:39,543 --> 00:46:40,287
Rym: We don't have any carpet.

746
00:46:40,327 --> 00:46:40,769
Scott: I have a rug.

747
00:46:41,197 --> 00:46:51,750
Scott: Yeah, right But if I look at the rug and if the rugs starting to look like there's a bunch of you know Dirt and filth on it, then I will actually clean the counters and tables first because that will sweep some filth.

748
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:56,630
Scott: important I always go top down like if I'm gonna day now vacuum literally everything.

749
00:46:56,650 --> 00:47:00,626
Rym: Yeah, like if I'm gonna dust I dust first before I do literally anything else.

750
00:47:00,746 --> 00:47:01,529
Rym: Otherwise, there's no point.

751
00:47:01,992 --> 00:47:04,610
Scott: Yeah, I'm just gonna ruin what I just did a vacuum everything.

752
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:07,562
Rym: But no I sweep the apartment literally every day.

753
00:47:07,602 --> 00:47:09,350
Rym: a quick sweep just to get up all the dust and stuff.

754
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:13,470
Rym: Hmm and that actually makes a big difference on the general cleanliness of the apartment.

755
00:47:14,132 --> 00:47:19,909
Rym: I'm up once a week, but like a quick like water mop not like janitor mop like working at de Bella's.

756
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:25,830
Scott: Yeah, I see thing is I don't mop but I wish I had the janitor mop like de Bella's because there's in the kitchen now.

757
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:26,874
Scott: It'd be nice to have up.

758
00:47:27,235 --> 00:47:34,704
Rym: an unnamed person just pointed out in the live stream chat The dishwasher fills and then it sits there clean a cough.

759
00:47:35,266 --> 00:47:37,837
Rym: Uh-huh An unnamed person just said that.

760
00:47:37,857 --> 00:47:39,002
Rym: just gonna point that out there.

761
00:47:39,102 --> 00:47:46,990
Rym: unnamed person should go back to work Stop wasting time washing pockets And other unnamed person is listening from the other room, right?

762
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:50,816
Rym: So so when do you mock?

763
00:47:50,837 --> 00:47:52,887
Rym: how often do you like sweet you ever sweep your apartment?

764
00:47:52,927 --> 00:47:53,550
Scott: now use the vacuum?

765
00:47:54,219 --> 00:47:55,655
Rym: Okay I I have been using.

766
00:47:55,675 --> 00:48:08,807
Rym: we have a pretty good vacuum that I just didn't use that often because it's all hardwood and we basically Got really like we only have one rug now and it's in the bunny room for the bunny because rabbits do not like to run On hardwood floors like he hates the hardwood floor.

767
00:48:08,907 --> 00:48:09,229
Scott: All right.

768
00:48:10,711 --> 00:48:15,390
Rym: Then yeah, he'd like going out of the hallway like we had a rug rolled up in the hallway for a while.

769
00:48:15,651 --> 00:48:20,990
Rym: So he would like very carefully walk over the hardwood into the hallway get up on that rug and then run across the rug.

770
00:48:21,351 --> 00:48:26,734
Rym: Mm-hmm, so pretty much got a sweep because there's no other way to keep stuff clean and then mop once a week And that's pretty much it.

771
00:48:27,076 --> 00:48:27,377
Rym: Mm-hmm.

772
00:48:28,201 --> 00:48:32,114
Scott: So the big problem I have right is Bathroom cleaning right?

773
00:48:32,756 --> 00:48:37,310
Scott: Uh, I used to have you know shower curtain right and shower curtains real easy.

774
00:48:37,812 --> 00:48:41,507
Scott: You just don't use solid soap and it doesn't really get scummy quickly at all.

775
00:48:41,647 --> 00:48:44,009
Rym: So weirdly enough I actually went back to using solid soap.

776
00:48:44,491 --> 00:48:46,037
Scott: Anyway, the point is it has the.

777
00:48:46,238 --> 00:48:49,690
Scott: you have a plastic, you know clear sheet on the inside and then the cloth.

778
00:48:50,892 --> 00:48:52,358
Rym: Only one sheet just cloth.

779
00:48:52,418 --> 00:48:52,960
Rym: That's the way to go.

780
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:55,330
Scott: No, no, no, you gotta have two plastic inside cloth.

781
00:48:55,594 --> 00:48:56,590
Rym: It gets disgusting.

782
00:48:57,412 --> 00:48:59,162
Scott: No, it takes a long time and then you should place it.

783
00:48:59,624 --> 00:49:00,650
Rym: Why would do that waste?

784
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:01,498
Rym: Why not just have what?

785
00:49:01,538 --> 00:49:02,650
Scott: I have one sheet.

786
00:49:02,811 --> 00:49:04,157
Scott: You never had to clean the cloth you want.

787
00:49:04,177 --> 00:49:07,030
Scott: it always looks great and it never gets wet or dirty or anything.

788
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:11,050
Rym: Immediately, it never gets dirty and like what?

789
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:13,379
Scott: Cloth one will get moldy and disgusting.

790
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:17,461
Rym: So one if it gets even slightly moldy All you do is put it in the washing machine.

791
00:49:17,481 --> 00:49:18,446
Scott: Yeah, I never had to do that.

792
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:22,309
Scott: Okay It's completely protected and beautiful and perfect and new at all times.

793
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:27,585
Rym: Nicely when I'm in the shower and I only have to wash it like once every several months.

794
00:49:27,605 --> 00:49:28,709
Scott: You also anyway.

795
00:49:31,432 --> 00:49:35,886
Scott: The other thing is now in the in the bathroom we use the shower in the most.

796
00:49:36,207 --> 00:49:37,010
Scott: we got the glass door.

797
00:49:37,512 --> 00:49:38,576
Rym: Oh, you got to get the squeegee.

798
00:49:38,918 --> 00:49:42,010
Rym: I have a squeegee, but you got to use the squeegee every time you shower.

799
00:49:42,131 --> 00:49:42,694
Rym: There's no point.

800
00:49:42,794 --> 00:49:46,975
Scott: Well, I tried to just you know, even before Forget preventing.

801
00:49:47,437 --> 00:49:50,430
Scott: Um, right just a one-time clean of the glass door.

802
00:49:51,294 --> 00:49:52,419
Scott: It's like I hate.

803
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:53,323
Scott: I got it.

804
00:49:53,363 --> 00:49:54,730
Scott: I have to do something severe.

805
00:49:55,151 --> 00:49:58,782
Scott: I tried two different ways to clean the glass door and it did not work.

806
00:49:58,862 --> 00:50:05,046
Scott: see that in maintenance cleaning aside the thing that I Need to do that initial clean of the glass door and I'm having a hard time.

807
00:50:05,167 --> 00:50:11,150
Rym: I hate Fully cleaning things like detail like if you do car work like the detail clean.

808
00:50:11,211 --> 00:50:18,490
Rym: There's a reason why if you go to like a car wash They charge you like a dollar to use the machine to like vacuum out your car or whatever.

809
00:50:18,892 --> 00:50:22,130
Rym: But if you want someone to like actually detail clean your car, it's like a hundred bucks.

810
00:50:22,251 --> 00:50:25,049
Rym: Yep, cuz that shit takes forever and is a pain in the ass.

811
00:50:25,651 --> 00:50:41,170
Rym: I hate detail cleaning and you'll notice anywhere I've ever lived like the detail areas like the Inside of the grout in the corner always gets a little shitty because I'm just unwilling to deal with that and then every now And then it gets too bad and then I have a miserable four hours, right?

812
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:44,582
Scott: Like I see you're doing frequent just kind of quick man clean.

813
00:50:44,642 --> 00:50:49,620
Rym: No frequent quick man cleaning Greatly extends the time before a crisis.

814
00:50:49,922 --> 00:50:56,410
Scott: see I just do Slightly less frequent but extensive cleans like when I go to clean that kitchen.

815
00:50:56,530 --> 00:50:58,038
Scott: It's like I clean every fucking dish.

816
00:50:58,299 --> 00:51:00,670
Scott: I scrub all the counters down till they're super shiny.

817
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:01,834
Rym: I do that every time I cook.

818
00:51:02,898 --> 00:51:10,230
Rym: I scrub the counters every time I cook only a few time Like I use me on the only scrub while I'm cooking.

819
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:13,030
Scott: I'm cleaning up the mess like I've lived in the apartment for a few months.

820
00:51:13,291 --> 00:51:16,100
Scott: I'd finally the front for the first time in the new apartment.

821
00:51:16,221 --> 00:51:18,007
Scott: I clean the top of the stove with mr.

822
00:51:18,047 --> 00:51:18,850
Scott: Clean's magic eraser.

823
00:51:19,394 --> 00:51:21,169
Scott: Oh, I do that every few months.

824
00:51:21,776 --> 00:51:23,150
Rym: The one thing I said went back to the shower.

825
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:27,609
Rym: The one thing that we both did a long time ago is I we try tried to use the like.

826
00:51:27,971 --> 00:51:30,805
Rym: Spray it on the walls every day after you shower and it'll keep the muck away.

827
00:51:30,825 --> 00:51:31,790
Scott: That shit doesn't work at all.

828
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:32,879
Scott: I don't know if I believe in that.

829
00:51:32,939 --> 00:51:43,168
Scott: I think it didn't work at all didn't exist when I was young and it came into existence sometime when I was maybe in high school middle school and At least it came to my attention at that seemed like all it did was it?

830
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:45,750
Scott: But it seemed to me like a scam to make you buy more shit.

831
00:51:46,011 --> 00:51:49,182
Rym: It seemed like it didn't prevent mildew which is added yet another layer of scum.

832
00:51:49,483 --> 00:51:53,341
Scott: Anyway, uh One thing I got let's let's stick to the bathroom.

833
00:51:53,381 --> 00:51:54,225
Scott: right so the Turlet.

834
00:51:54,608 --> 00:51:56,733
Rym: All right For the Turlet.

835
00:51:56,753 --> 00:51:57,536
Scott: well, so the Turlet.

836
00:51:57,576 --> 00:52:02,010
Scott: first of all, there's all sorts of like preventative things they sell for the toilet.

837
00:52:02,091 --> 00:52:03,263
Scott: I don't believe any of that garbage.

838
00:52:03,404 --> 00:52:06,749
Rym: Well the one Don't put anything in the top tank.

839
00:52:07,122 --> 00:52:19,050
Scott: No Well, there's also ones were like you put it like a goop on the side of the bowl and right it's all kinds like You know things that they have for toilets like prevent it from getting dirty and those have never were shit in it.

840
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:20,624
Rym: Just let it get dirty and clean it.

841
00:52:20,745 --> 00:52:24,041
Scott: Yeah Not those have not functioned in my opinion.

842
00:52:24,061 --> 00:52:26,290
Scott: from my experience I did some slight tests.

843
00:52:27,731 --> 00:52:28,574
Rym: About once a week.

844
00:52:28,835 --> 00:52:42,550
Rym: I'll wipe the toilet down just with a toilet paper and then flush it like after I use the toilet Mmm, and then about once every couple weeks I'll use disinfectant and just like clean out the bowl really quick like spray it in there scrub it flush it and then I'm good.

845
00:52:43,512 --> 00:52:45,660
Rym: And like once a month, I'll disinfect the whole thing.

846
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:47,266
Rym: Like if I spraying it with a chemical.

847
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:48,150
Scott: Oh you spray it.

848
00:52:48,572 --> 00:52:51,504
Rym: I just spray the whole toilet like the outside to handle everything with like.

849
00:52:51,684 --> 00:52:53,010
Scott: what about this side and the end?

850
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:54,435
Rym: I just spray everything with disinfectant.

851
00:52:54,455 --> 00:52:55,680
Scott: Okay, so for the inside.

852
00:52:55,700 --> 00:53:01,430
Rym: as soon as I see stuff building up on the inside Yep, I put a noop in there and then I scrub it with a toilet brush, right?

853
00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:04,528
Scott: I get the the stuff in the bottle with the with the gooseneck.

854
00:53:04,609 --> 00:53:06,339
Rym: Yep The gooseneck that's the.

855
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:08,030
Scott: squeeze it all up in the groove.

856
00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:11,950
Scott: Yeah, right and you got to make sure it a hundred percent covers the inside of the bowl.

857
00:53:12,111 --> 00:53:16,730
Rym: No spots where it's not touching because up in those grooves is where your smells coming from not the bowl.

858
00:53:18,151 --> 00:53:26,786
Scott: And then and then I just wait it's for like 15 minutes and then I go with the toilet brush Yeah, and then I flush it I totally brush the hell out of it and I don't you know tablets or any.

859
00:53:27,088 --> 00:53:28,799
Scott: nah Preventative things just that.

860
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,290
Rym: only if you need to super disinfect.

861
00:53:30,430 --> 00:53:42,349
Rym: And one thing I found is use a plunger or like the toilet brush to get the water out of the bowl like push it Over through the the you neck or the s the thing inside Mmm, so the bowl is empty then put the goop in and let it sit there for longer.

862
00:53:42,912 --> 00:53:43,555
Rym: You don't need to do that.

863
00:53:43,655 --> 00:53:44,278
Rym: often you do that.

864
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:46,770
Rym: if like there's a problem in the toilet, yeah.

865
00:53:48,211 --> 00:53:50,903
Scott: So then your bathroom probably had like a sink.

866
00:53:50,924 --> 00:53:52,330
Scott: you just spray it and scrub it, right?

867
00:53:52,690 --> 00:54:05,868
Rym: So yeah The one of the thing that changed my life in terms of the bathroom the most is I bought a like pretty nice handheld like stiff bristle bristle scrubber thing and I clean everything but the toilet with that Like I just scrub the inside of my.

868
00:54:05,888 --> 00:54:11,410
Rym: well The problem is the sink in our bathrooms in this building are nice, but they're big and kind of flat.

869
00:54:11,871 --> 00:54:16,610
Rym: So they don't really ever get have water touching all the parts unless I fill them with water.

870
00:54:17,031 --> 00:54:19,922
Rym: So if I don't scrub it gunk will accumulate pretty quickly.

871
00:54:19,942 --> 00:54:22,230
Rym: So I have to scrub it like every couple days.

872
00:54:23,472 --> 00:54:27,064
Rym: Yeah, the problem I have in the new I own this place I would put different sinks in.

873
00:54:27,265 --> 00:54:28,010
Scott: the sinks are good.

874
00:54:28,271 --> 00:54:30,739
Scott: The problem we have is these giant mirrors in the bathrooms.

875
00:54:31,181 --> 00:54:32,867
Scott: Ah, yeah, even with like it's like.

876
00:54:32,927 --> 00:54:34,673
Scott: oh, I got some Windex I got the squeegee.

877
00:54:34,713 --> 00:54:35,375
Scott: I got whatever.

878
00:54:35,396 --> 00:54:40,898
Scott: I can't seem to figure out how to clean the wind the mirror and not leave a bunch Everywhere that.

879
00:54:40,918 --> 00:54:43,090
Scott: so there must be some special way.

880
00:54:43,110 --> 00:54:44,930
Rym: I'm gonna tell you it'll feel a little wasteful.

881
00:54:45,071 --> 00:54:48,370
Rym: But this is the only way to keep a mirror like actually like spotless.

882
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:49,958
Rym: Uh-huh, so use the Windex like.

883
00:54:49,978 --> 00:54:51,184
Rym: it has to be like real like a moat.

884
00:54:51,204 --> 00:54:52,229
Scott: I got real Windex.

885
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:53,193
Scott: Yeah, there's Windex.

886
00:54:53,273 --> 00:54:54,538
Scott: Oh spray it all over.

887
00:54:54,558 --> 00:54:55,562
Scott: I think you need.

888
00:54:55,582 --> 00:54:59,618
Rym: Yeah, then take paper towel All right, and wipe it down.

889
00:54:59,658 --> 00:55:02,007
Scott: I've tried to do that and it always gets tricky.

890
00:55:02,469 --> 00:55:05,225
Rym: I Cannot imagine such a scenario.

891
00:55:05,245 --> 00:55:10,510
Rym: I've tried to do that My bathroom right now and you will see zero streaks with that method and no other.

892
00:55:10,773 --> 00:55:12,369
Scott: I'll try the paper towel method again.

893
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:16,970
Scott: But the last time I tried the paper towel method it didn't work and someone told me I should use newsprint.

894
00:55:17,231 --> 00:55:19,299
Scott: I don't fucking have news don't use newsprint.

895
00:55:19,339 --> 00:55:20,363
Rym: Just use paper towel.

896
00:55:20,443 --> 00:55:22,250
Scott: I'd never even tried that because it sounded so dumb.

897
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:24,334
Scott: Paper towel did not work.

898
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:29,150
Rym: I use newsprint as like fine sandpaper for nonsense not for like a mirror, right?

899
00:55:29,290 --> 00:55:34,250
Scott: Yeah, I don't know what they're talking about But I also I clean the the windows the same way.

900
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:37,230
Scott: But what's annoying is that you know my previous apartment.

901
00:55:37,371 --> 00:55:40,444
Scott: It was possible for me to clean the in and outside of all the windows.

902
00:55:40,665 --> 00:55:41,830
Rym: of all the windows in our apartment.

903
00:55:41,911 --> 00:55:44,708
Rym: I can only clean the ones in the living room the balcony the window.

904
00:55:44,748 --> 00:55:46,701
Rym: here I have no access to the outside at all.

905
00:55:46,721 --> 00:55:48,090
Rym: The building has never cleaned it, right?

906
00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:50,110
Scott: I want the building to come clean the stupid window.

907
00:55:50,592 --> 00:55:52,238
Scott: I can only clean the balcony ones.

908
00:55:52,338 --> 00:55:57,517
Rym: our building can't clean the window because there's a scaffold around it because our facade Failed an inspection and they haven't fixed it.

909
00:55:57,557 --> 00:55:57,738
Scott: Yeah.

910
00:55:57,758 --> 00:56:00,207
Scott: Well, they there's no facade around our building that they.

911
00:56:00,268 --> 00:56:02,174
Rym: but you know Your facade is not broken.

912
00:56:02,475 --> 00:56:07,128
Scott: No, but but uh, you know if it gets dirty or I'm gonna ask him to clean it.

913
00:56:07,309 --> 00:56:08,532
Rym: Yeah It's.

914
00:56:08,713 --> 00:56:10,550
Rym: uh, I gave up on that.

915
00:56:10,690 --> 00:56:20,126
Rym: I just cleaned the windows in the living room and like the spring and the ball and otherwise this don't bother because New York like the amount of dust in New York compared to almost anywhere else in America.

916
00:56:20,146 --> 00:56:21,550
Rym: You could live is terrifying.

917
00:56:21,871 --> 00:56:23,677
Rym: Oh, yeah, and windows get dirty so fast.

918
00:56:23,998 --> 00:56:25,323
Rym: You can't keep them clean.

919
00:56:25,483 --> 00:56:25,744
Rym: There's no.

920
00:56:25,805 --> 00:56:27,390
Scott: but when they are clean, it's so nice.

921
00:56:27,611 --> 00:56:28,575
Scott: It's like a whole new world.

922
00:56:28,615 --> 00:56:30,523
Rym: Yeah for like a day not for a little while.

00:56:55,326 --> 00:56:56,310
Scott: I gotta find the best mop.

940
00:56:57,451 --> 00:57:00,201
Rym: The any microfiber tornado mop is fine.

941
00:57:00,221 --> 00:57:02,088
Scott: Yeah, I used to have one of those didn't work.

942
00:57:02,108 --> 00:57:04,155
Rym: So great How do you know how to mop?

943
00:57:04,637 --> 00:57:08,309
Rym: to explain to me the process that you use to mop with a tornado mop?

944
00:57:10,372 --> 00:57:12,142
Rym: I got it wet with what do you have a?

945
00:57:12,323 --> 00:57:13,590
Rym: do you fill a bucket with water?

946
00:57:14,070 --> 00:57:15,598
Rym: Yeah, you put anything in that water.

947
00:57:15,639 --> 00:57:16,242
Rym: Is it just water?

948
00:57:16,885 --> 00:57:17,629
Scott: I tried both ways.

949
00:57:18,092 --> 00:57:19,901
Rym: Okay, so then what do you do with the mop?

950
00:57:19,962 --> 00:57:21,570
Scott: you get away put the mop in the bucket?

951
00:57:21,830 --> 00:57:28,622
Rym: All right, and then rub the mop all over the floor Like fully a fully soft mop like without wringing it out first.

952
00:57:28,943 --> 00:57:31,650
Scott: you wring it out after but it's full of dirty water.

953
00:57:32,092 --> 00:57:35,124
Scott: You've wring the dirty water out and then you put more clean water on it.

954
00:57:35,144 --> 00:57:36,309
Rym: I don't think you know how to mop.

955
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:38,734
Scott: Okay, you wring out the clean.

956
00:57:38,834 --> 00:57:39,175
Scott: Oh god.

957
00:57:39,656 --> 00:57:40,198
Rym: I didn't know.

958
00:57:40,298 --> 00:57:46,135
Rym: I realized I didn't know how to mop until I worked at that de Bellas And I had to close.

959
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:51,618
Scott: but whenever I worked at a food place mopping was easy because it was already like you would just take The yellow bucket with wheels.

960
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:57,443
Scott: Yeah, right and you had the mop And you could squirt chemical and then there was the squeezy thing on the bucket.

961
00:57:57,563 --> 00:57:59,310
Rym: Yeah, my mop has a squeezy thing on it.

962
00:58:00,131 --> 00:58:00,935
Scott: Yeah, it's right.

963
00:58:00,975 --> 00:58:03,950
Scott: So I squeeze the dirty water out into the like the sink or whatever.

964
00:58:04,833 --> 00:58:07,737
Scott: Okay Yeah, I don't think you know how to mop.

965
00:58:07,958 --> 00:58:10,690
Rym: Okay, I did they but I'd worked at that stupid place.

966
00:58:11,011 --> 00:58:14,703
Rym: They sat me down and they're like here is the way that you have to mop.

967
00:58:14,783 --> 00:58:18,256
Rym: so it'll actually like clean things and we won't Get dinged by the health inspectors.

968
00:58:18,598 --> 00:58:20,870
Rym: and I learned like legit the four different ones.

969
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:24,068
Rym: So it depends on what kind of mopping you're doing.

970
00:58:24,149 --> 00:58:27,287
Rym: so Basic mopping with a microfiber tornado mop is.

971
00:58:27,569 --> 00:58:30,283
Rym: yet There's a wet version and a dry version of this.

972
00:58:30,705 --> 00:58:33,581
Rym: for the dry version You dunk the mop in the water get it wet.

973
00:58:33,842 --> 00:58:41,330
Rym: clean water mops wet Lift the mop up and shake it until no more water is like drip like water is not dripping out of the mop anymore.

974
00:58:41,411 --> 00:58:43,206
Rym: So it's kind of wet but not sopping wet.

975
00:58:43,428 --> 00:58:45,958
Rym: Mm-hmm Then mop your mop your area.

976
00:58:45,978 --> 00:58:55,270
Rym: if it's a big area break it up into sections with that wet mop Ring it out then dip it in the water again to clean it out and wring it out again in the water.

977
00:58:55,772 --> 00:58:59,846
Rym: Then with the dry rung out mob use it to sop up all the water.

978
00:58:59,866 --> 00:59:00,889
Rym: You just got all over the floor.

979
00:59:01,633 --> 00:59:04,869
Rym: That's like the basic method for like the easiest quick mop.

980
00:59:05,191 --> 00:59:06,816
Scott: I mean that's basically why I did.

981
00:59:06,916 --> 00:59:08,442
Scott: when I'm up to accept I never.

982
00:59:08,462 --> 00:59:10,950
Rym: I never tried amount of muck and dirt.

983
00:59:11,071 --> 00:59:12,739
Scott: I never tried to sop up the water.

984
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:14,690
Scott: I would I would let the water evaporate.

985
00:59:14,810 --> 00:59:17,061
Rym: No, cuz then there's that water that you left.

986
00:59:17,101 --> 00:59:18,950
Rym: there has most of the dirt still in it.

987
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:20,335
Rym: That's the problem.

988
00:59:20,355 --> 00:59:22,310
Scott: I was scrubbing pretty hard when I was putting that water down.

989
00:59:22,491 --> 00:59:25,410
Rym: Yeah, and you're gonna leave most of that scrubbed out muck in that water.

990
00:59:25,410 --> 00:59:26,821
Scott: You gotta mop the water back up.

991
00:59:26,862 --> 00:59:27,850
Scott: This stuff should be in the mop.

992
00:59:28,131 --> 00:59:29,338
Rym: No, that's not how mobbing works.

993
00:59:29,358 --> 00:59:33,376
Scott: Then when I went to when I went to wring the mop out in the sink All kinds of filth came out.

994
00:59:33,537 --> 00:59:34,982
Rym: Yeah, but there's more filth down.

995
00:59:35,062 --> 00:59:38,983
Rym: if you don't mop it back up You're leaving a lot of the filth on the floor.

996
00:59:39,003 --> 00:59:44,390
Rym: Uh-huh The other thing is a deep mop is where you actually there's other way like there's disinfecting mop or whatever.

997
00:59:44,652 --> 00:59:45,238
Rym: We live in a house.

998
00:59:45,258 --> 00:59:46,509
Rym: We don't really need to worry about that.

999
00:59:47,031 --> 00:59:52,170
Rym: But the other serious mopping you need to do occasionally especially if you have like a hardwood floor is you get the mop.

1000
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:57,508
Rym: That's basically just like a big sponge on the end and you use chemicals and you like scrub everything with a sponge.

1001
00:59:57,568 --> 00:59:58,833
Scott: basically Yeah, that's what.

1002
00:59:58,853 --> 01:00:00,678
Scott: that's how my parents wash the kitchen floor.

1003
01:00:00,758 --> 01:00:07,983
Scott: I do that like once a year, but they weren't doing what you said of You know going again with the dry one and right.

1004
01:00:08,023 --> 01:00:09,610
Scott: they would just be like no one go in the kitchen.

1005
01:00:09,691 --> 01:00:11,350
Scott: It's the waters that the floor is wet.

1006
01:00:12,474 --> 01:00:13,746
Rym: Bad way to mop in most cases.

1007
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:18,440
Scott: They've mobbed my entire childhood that it would say I'm up in the floor.

1008
01:00:18,481 --> 01:00:19,223
Scott: Don't come in the kitchen.

1009
01:00:19,604 --> 01:00:22,055
Rym: Okay, that's uh Went to.

1010
01:00:22,075 --> 01:00:23,929
Scott: the floor was dry again that everyone come back in.

1011
01:00:24,392 --> 01:00:26,605
Rym: I feel like I should link to a bunch of YouTube videos on how to mop.

1012
01:00:27,088 --> 01:00:35,404
Rym: maybe the only thing that's annoying is that living in New York mopping like The amount of just grime that gets into my apartment is so much.

1013
01:00:35,445 --> 01:00:40,850
Scott: I don't really have to mop the kitchen I don't really to mop anywhere else cuz everywhere else the vacuum it takes care of everything.

1014
01:00:40,930 --> 01:00:47,582
Scott: Yeah, cuz we I don't allow anything that needs to be mopped to Lee You know to not be in the kitchen ish area.

1015
01:00:47,803 --> 01:00:49,190
Rym: true the kitchen the kitchen is white.

1016
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:53,265
Rym: Like I don't actually mop everything once a week usually like I'll do to pick up dust.

1017
01:00:53,526 --> 01:00:55,997
Scott: cuz there's dust I don't need to mop in the office.

1018
01:00:56,077 --> 01:00:56,780
Scott: What's in there?

1019
01:00:56,800 --> 01:01:02,499
Rym: No nothing though when I'm up in here I'll tear even despite vacuuming and sweeping.

1020
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:05,710
Rym: you would be shocked at how much dust I pull up out of this floor.

1021
01:01:06,072 --> 01:01:14,168
Scott: When I mop every week, I mean, yeah dust just comes from everywhere Yeah, but there isn't gonna be like, you know a splash of tomato sauce from when you were cooking on this floor.

1022
01:01:14,228 --> 01:01:16,160
Scott: true true Right that you that one needs a mop.

1023
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:17,328
Scott: a vacuum ain't gonna take care of that.

1024
01:01:17,349 --> 01:01:19,539
Rym: Yep That's why I'm off the kitchen very frequently.

1025
01:01:19,559 --> 01:01:22,030
Rym: Mmm, and I mop with bleach in the bathrooms.

1026
01:01:22,951 --> 01:01:24,176
Scott: I don't I don't like to use bleach.

1027
01:01:24,197 --> 01:01:24,980
Scott: I like to use it.

1028
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:26,466
Scott: ammonia cleaners.

1029
01:01:26,788 --> 01:01:27,350
Rym: ammonia is okay.

1030
01:01:27,430 --> 01:01:29,020
Rym: I only use ammonia on glass though.

1031
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:37,498
Scott: I tend to use bleach when I'm disinfecting the thing I try to avoid the bleach is because The Bleach can like sometimes discolor something.

1032
01:01:37,518 --> 01:01:40,790
Rym: Yeah, but the bleach will not discolor the tiles in my bathroom.

1033
01:01:40,790 --> 01:01:42,238
Rym: That's the only place I use bleach.

1034
01:01:42,339 --> 01:01:43,746
Scott: Okay, if you keep it to one place here.

1035
01:01:43,786 --> 01:01:44,430
Scott: Okay, it's bathrooms.

1036
01:01:44,551 --> 01:01:46,105
Rym: I have a different mop for the bathroom.

1037
01:01:46,125 --> 01:01:48,058
Rym: I don't use the mop I use the rest of the house in the bathroom.

1038
01:01:48,098 --> 01:01:49,970
Rym: Yeah, and that mop is basically for the bleach.

1039
01:01:50,151 --> 01:01:52,000
Scott: You gotta watch out for the ammonia bleach combo.

1040
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:52,402
Scott: No good.

1041
01:01:52,563 --> 01:01:54,050
Rym: Yep, it scared.

1042
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:58,489
Rym: It's sad to me how many adults don't know that my grandpa even fucked it up.

1043
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:02,550
Scott: I remember one time we came home and like what the fuck did you do?

1044
01:02:03,332 --> 01:02:03,998
Scott: What's wrong with you?

1045
01:02:04,059 --> 01:02:05,029
Scott: Even I know how to do that.

1046
01:02:05,973 --> 01:02:09,198
Rym: but at the same time like From the other I think I think he was.

1047
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:16,236
Scott: I think what he had done is like he knew that it was bad Right, but he was like it cleans so well Uh-huh, and he was us like he like.

1048
01:02:16,276 --> 01:02:23,508
Scott: he knew he had all the windows open and was ventilating and he's like, ah I'll be able to clean everything well and not get poisoned by chlorine.

1049
01:02:23,528 --> 01:02:27,199
Scott: Yes Well, I preemptively opened all the windows and turned the fans on.

1050
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:34,250
Scott: now I can clean with the deadly bleach ammonia combo and it's like No, no, you can't fucking kill you.

1051
01:02:34,290 --> 01:02:35,041
Scott: It's World War one.

1052
01:02:35,122 --> 01:02:35,609
Scott: don't do that.

1053
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:43,115
Rym: But I think part of the problem is that if you don't know chemistry or someone didn't tell you This is dangerous.

1054
01:02:43,798 --> 01:02:46,210
Rym: It is not an obvious danger in the world.

1055
01:02:46,270 --> 01:02:51,410
Scott: The point is there's no reason to ever combine two cleaning products regardless of ammonia bleach combo.

1056
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:54,060
Scott: There is no reason to combine two cleaning products.

1057
01:02:54,301 --> 01:02:55,125
Scott: one will get it done.

1058
01:02:55,145 --> 01:02:56,430
Scott: It doesn't get it done.

1059
01:02:56,470 --> 01:02:57,336
Scott: It's a shitty cleaning.

1060
01:02:57,397 --> 01:02:58,303
Scott: throw that shit out.

1061
01:02:58,384 --> 01:02:59,230
Scott: buy something different.

1062
01:02:59,331 --> 01:03:01,650
Scott: Don't use two things at the same time in the same place.

1063
01:03:01,730 --> 01:03:07,210
Scott: There's no reason to ever also just get something else is good enough on its own and you'll never have a problem.

1064
01:03:07,411 --> 01:03:17,289
Rym: While I use bleach on the floor of the bathroom like disinfect everything the one thing I don't clean with bleach is the toilet Because I pee in the toilet and my pee has some ammonia in it.

1065
01:03:17,531 --> 01:03:18,520
Rym: Mm-hmm, like I don't know.

1066
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:19,872
Rym: but bleach in the toilet I don't.

1067
01:03:19,892 --> 01:03:21,384
Scott: that's something serious to worry about.

1068
01:03:21,485 --> 01:03:27,710
Scott: but yeah I usually will buy something that just says no bleach in it because why if I need to bleach something I'll buy some bleach?

1069
01:03:27,931 --> 01:03:30,189
Scott: Yeah, I don't really need to do it that often.

1070
01:03:30,330 --> 01:03:31,655
Rym: Yeah, I don't I don't you have.

1071
01:03:31,696 --> 01:03:36,153
Rym: also you can have a tiny thing of bleach and it'll last you forever because you do not Need a lot of bleach.

1072
01:03:36,334 --> 01:03:38,924
Scott: Yeah, even when I do like the thing I'll.

1073
01:03:38,944 --> 01:03:41,292
Scott: bleach most often is like white clothing I have.

1074
01:03:41,452 --> 01:03:45,825
Scott: I never use bleach for laundry detergent and borax only I'll use the the powdery one.

1075
01:03:46,407 --> 01:03:47,350
Rym: Yeah, why though?

1076
01:03:47,770 --> 01:03:48,434
Scott: It's super rare.

1077
01:03:48,454 --> 01:03:51,290
Scott: It's only if something is super white and I really want to clean it.

1078
01:03:51,330 --> 01:03:56,430
Rym: I don't think I have anything that's super white like a white undershirt, but I get super white undershirts.

1079
01:03:57,715 --> 01:03:58,377
Scott: I think I had it.

1080
01:03:58,417 --> 01:03:59,340
Scott: I think I used it once.

1081
01:03:59,621 --> 01:04:01,990
Scott: Yeah, maybe twice right, but I have it.

1082
01:04:02,190 --> 01:04:04,742
Rym: Yeah, my real pro we've talked about laundry before so I won't get into it.

1083
01:04:04,782 --> 01:04:05,345
Rym: But I've done.

1084
01:04:05,626 --> 01:04:11,047
Rym: I use like Unscented like generic detergent and I use borax and that combo is great.

1085
01:04:11,067 --> 01:04:11,790
Rym: I didn't use anything else.

1086
01:04:12,412 --> 01:04:12,893
Scott: Oh something.

1087
01:04:12,914 --> 01:04:15,382
Scott: so just talk about cleaning equipments, right?

1088
01:04:15,402 --> 01:04:17,650
Scott: So I bought the best squeegee on Amazon, right?

1089
01:04:18,711 --> 01:04:19,113
Scott: I bought.

1090
01:04:19,133 --> 01:04:25,886
Rym: I bought the cheapest squeegee on Amazon and gear ago and guess what it broke after one use About like the highest the five-star squeegee.

1091
01:04:25,906 --> 01:04:28,273
Scott: Yep For bathroom.

1092
01:04:28,393 --> 01:04:31,162
Scott: I like anything that is the scrubbing bubbles brand.

1093
01:04:32,045 --> 01:04:33,690
Scott: I just like the little character.

1094
01:04:33,871 --> 01:04:36,921
Rym: He's like, alright, you would you had the scrubbing bubbles in colony.

1095
01:04:36,982 --> 01:04:39,310
Scott: It's a. it's a little brushy guy with googly eyes.

1096
01:04:39,350 --> 01:04:41,417
Scott: Yes, that's definitely the best guy, right?

1097
01:04:41,437 --> 01:04:44,125
Rym: I don't think the bubbles do much though.

1098
01:04:44,145 --> 01:04:45,510
Rym: I feel like he's lying to you.

1099
01:04:45,711 --> 01:04:49,309
Scott: Oh, no, the bubbles just go to make it sound like it's cleaning but I mean it works.

1100
01:04:50,531 --> 01:04:58,201
Rym: It's like the scam like if you buy selson blue or off-brand selson blue There's the normal one for dandruff and also versicolor like.

1101
01:04:58,261 --> 01:04:58,964
Rym: it works on both.

1102
01:04:58,984 --> 01:04:59,646
Scott: Well, I mean, it's just.

1103
01:04:59,706 --> 01:04:59,947
Scott: it's just.

1104
01:05:00,187 --> 01:05:08,023
Rym: it's an antifungal Yeah, and then there's the medicated one The only difference mental normal one and the medicated one.

1105
01:05:08,263 --> 01:05:10,550
Rym: They both have the same amount of the medicine.

1106
01:05:10,771 --> 01:05:11,794
Rym: Yeah, that kills the fungus.

1107
01:05:12,135 --> 01:05:18,330
Rym: the medicated one just has mints and aloe and stuff in it So it feels more medical.

1108
01:05:19,571 --> 01:05:21,323
Scott: Tingly it doesn't know smells minty.

1109
01:05:21,384 --> 01:05:22,250
Scott: It has menthol in it.

1110
01:05:22,310 --> 01:05:27,090
Rym: Yeah, it'll like make you tingle like people put peroxide in a lot of stuff just to make it feel like it's doing more.

1111
01:05:27,330 --> 01:05:31,506
Rym: Yeah, there's even some medicines that taste bad to make it feel like it's doing more.

1112
01:05:31,566 --> 01:05:32,630
Scott: Yep, bullshit.

1113
01:05:32,730 --> 01:05:41,703
Scott: Yeah, you gotta watch out these all you can look and see what the actual cleaning chemical is or everything else is not And somehow this topic was able to kill more than an hour.

1114
01:05:41,804 --> 01:05:42,245
Rym: We're out.

1115
01:05:42,567 --> 01:05:43,350
Scott: Oh, I have more to say.

1116
01:05:44,072 --> 01:05:44,393
Scott: Let's go.

1117
01:05:44,474 --> 01:05:48,668
Scott: I just want to say that, you know when I'm final thoughts with Scott when I'm wiping down the counter, right?

1118
01:05:49,250 --> 01:05:50,436
Scott: I used to use a sponge.

1119
01:05:50,718 --> 01:05:51,823
Rym: Oh, I know.

1120
01:05:51,864 --> 01:05:53,090
Rym: go we upgraded recently.

1121
01:05:53,130 --> 01:05:56,603
Scott: I don't like to use you know, anything disposable like a paper towel.

1122
01:05:56,643 --> 01:05:56,724
Scott: Yeah.

1123
01:05:56,744 --> 01:05:58,430
Rym: Well, the problem is burn through too much of it.

1124
01:05:58,450 --> 01:06:03,690
Rym: Yeah, the problem is paper towel is the most effective and also like the easiest to deal with and also the most wasteful.

1125
01:06:03,850 --> 01:06:05,817
Rym: Yeah, it was the most wasteful and I always felt bad about it.

1126
01:06:05,917 --> 01:06:09,448
Rym: So Emily picked up these fancy like reusable paper towels.

1127
01:06:09,629 --> 01:06:09,950
Scott: Okay?

1128
01:06:10,031 --> 01:06:10,817
Scott: Oh, I've seen those.

1129
01:06:10,878 --> 01:06:11,382
Scott: Yeah, they were.

1130
01:06:11,402 --> 01:06:14,050
Scott: they're really good Like I remember Kate had them.

1131
01:06:14,090 --> 01:06:22,590
Rym: yeah, they're a washcloth effectively that you can use for all the things used for paper towel and Then they dry out use them for like a week or two and when they're disgusting you can still throw them away.

1132
01:06:22,792 --> 01:06:30,989
Scott: What I have is I have these school Soy based sort of cloths not microfiber cloths, right which are only good for cleaning certain things.

1133
01:06:31,049 --> 01:06:35,826
Scott: Yep They're sort of like, you know, like the the sponges that start out flat.

1134
01:06:35,866 --> 01:06:37,050
Scott: you put water and they expand.

1135
01:06:37,170 --> 01:06:44,117
Scott: Yeah, imagine if it just didn't expand but it was just like a big square that you could get wet And you could really scrub shit down.

1136
01:06:44,138 --> 01:06:44,579
Scott: pretty nice.

1137
01:06:44,599 --> 01:06:45,363
Scott: Those things are great.

1138
01:06:45,383 --> 01:06:45,563
Rym: Yes.

1139
01:06:45,624 --> 01:06:49,402
Scott: That's what I use and also mr Clean's magic eraser on the top of the stove.

1140
01:06:49,624 --> 01:06:49,845
Scott: Yep.

1141
01:06:50,126 --> 01:06:53,220
Rym: I also use mr Clean's magic eraser for scuffs on walls and things.

1142
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:54,123
Scott: the best thing is mr.

1143
01:06:54,163 --> 01:06:58,877
Scott: Clean's magic eraser or Equivalent non branded same exact thing.

1144
01:06:58,978 --> 01:07:00,942
Scott: No is non.

1145
01:07:01,263 --> 01:07:02,506
Scott: It's not chemically acting.

1146
01:07:02,586 --> 01:07:04,010
Scott: It's it's just acts on friction.

1147
01:07:04,533 --> 01:07:10,560
Scott: it's like this really tiny abrasive thing and You just scrape you just scrub things off.

1148
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:13,050
Scott: you can use it like to get crayon off a wall.

1149
01:07:13,652 --> 01:07:19,888
Scott: You can use it in all sorts of crazy stuff without any if you're worried about like chemically damaging or something like that.

1150
01:07:20,068 --> 01:07:22,163
Scott: Yep So there you go.

1151
01:07:23,451 --> 01:07:24,715
Rym: So my last thing.

1152
01:07:24,735 --> 01:07:26,100
Rym: I got a final thought.

1153
01:07:26,702 --> 01:07:36,489
Rym: we I deserve are still uses for paper towel like I try to get less but like if you need absorbing mirrors or Cleaning up something like a Mirror when I get home.

1154
01:07:36,530 --> 01:07:41,830
Rym: Yeah Like cleaning up something that is like has oil or grease on it that you don't want to get that like into your long.

1155
01:07:41,991 --> 01:07:47,670
Scott: I use paper towel more for cooking like pat dry, you know pat dry some chicken or pat dry some shrimpies.

1156
01:07:47,770 --> 01:07:49,058
Scott: That's what I use it for the most.

1157
01:07:49,279 --> 01:07:51,170
Rym: or to like get the grease off of some bacon.

1158
01:07:51,331 --> 01:07:52,339
Scott: I don't use napkins ever.

1159
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:53,428
Scott: I only use paper towel.

1160
01:07:53,448 --> 01:08:00,208
Rym: same Napkins are just like an inferior for just boomer things, but we don't useable.

1161
01:08:00,228 --> 01:08:03,370
Scott: napkins are okay Yeah, but our fancy party.

1162
01:08:03,538 --> 01:08:08,086
Rym: so We tried to get some like much more eco-friendly like I think bamboo based paper towel.

1163
01:08:08,106 --> 01:08:17,729
Scott: because if we're gonna use that I want like The least damaging one I buy the one that is the biggest role with the the most Smaller sheets so I can use less at a time.

1164
01:08:17,729 --> 01:08:22,710
Rym: Yep I get the ones where I can get like the three inch long like strip at a time instead of the giant square.

1165
01:08:22,790 --> 01:08:25,982
Rym: Yeah foot by foot, but we got this eco-friendly bamboo.

1166
01:08:26,764 --> 01:08:28,270
Rym: It is so shitty.

1167
01:08:29,450 --> 01:08:30,575
Rym: It's like it's worthless.

1168
01:08:30,916 --> 01:08:31,981
Rym: we went we went back.

1169
01:08:32,001 --> 01:08:37,398
Rym: we're gonna go back to like the big thick like Midwestern suburban like brawny type stuff.

1170
01:08:37,417 --> 01:08:39,305
Scott: Yeah, it's like bounty brawn.

1171
01:08:39,326 --> 01:08:40,229
Scott: The one I have now is football.

1172
01:08:40,270 --> 01:08:42,078
Rym: It's kind of like toilet paper like I bought it around.

1173
01:08:42,139 --> 01:08:44,390
Rym: I tried to go with like a really eco-friendly toilet paper.

1174
01:08:45,211 --> 01:08:47,381
Rym: Nope, so I had to go back to the Charmin.

1175
01:08:47,562 --> 01:08:51,356
Scott: No, I go to the most luxurious Toilet paper.

1176
01:08:51,397 --> 01:08:52,970
Rym: You can't use that Wegmans one-ply.

1177
01:08:58,591 --> 01:09:00,837
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
