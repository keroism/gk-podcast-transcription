1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,491
Rym: It's Tuesday October 20th 2020.

2
00:00:12,491 --> 00:00:15,479
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,153
Rym: tonight We are talking about Star Wars squadrons.

4
00:00:18,616 --> 00:00:18,998
Rym: It's out.

5
00:00:19,961 --> 00:00:20,976
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:22,202 --> 00:00:30,215
Rym: you may recall we were gonna do this show a couple weeks ago, but Horrible water came up out of my sink and that was an odyssey to deal with.

7
00:00:30,255 --> 00:00:33,251
Rym: it is now dealt with but I had to Deal with it, but this past weekend.

8
00:00:33,775 --> 00:00:46,187
Rym: I wanted to go out hiking Which like that like hiking in the remote wilderness Much like biking in the middle of nowhere is a decent hobby to have in the middle of a global pandemic Like stay away from people be in the middle of nowhere This time and

9
00:00:46,207 --> 00:00:48,971
Scott: everyone has the same idea Away to the woods.

10
00:00:49,011 --> 00:00:49,899
Scott: There's no people there.

11
00:00:50,405 --> 00:00:56,360
Rym: They do have that idea But the vast majority of people will never get more than a mile away from a parking lot or a trailhead.

12
00:00:56,741 --> 00:01:00,879
Rym: So you just go somewhere remote get to a hard trail and you won't encounter any people.

13
00:01:01,701 --> 00:01:02,886
Scott: Yep, that's what happens when I go.

14
00:01:02,926 --> 00:01:19,139
Scott: biking is like I'll go out into the who knows where and As soon as I get I'll encounter like, you know bike paths that are like your trails separate from the road And if I'm near the road or near the end There'll be people and then you just go a bit and it's like no more people.

15
00:01:19,367 --> 00:01:23,100
Rym: Yep Like on the South County ever away you're going and there's that one park where there's a big parking lot.

16
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,877
Rym: There's a million people on the trail just there get even a half a mile past.

17
00:01:26,897 --> 00:01:27,480
Rym: that nobody.

18
00:01:28,362 --> 00:01:32,283
Scott: Yeah, it's like people only go so far and then nope They did like that's.

19
00:01:32,323 --> 00:01:36,860
Scott: as far as I go they turn around and the density just like drops off precipitously.

20
00:01:37,202 --> 00:01:44,000
Rym: Yep, which you know, I thought my whole life I've thought about that like that was a thing that my kid brain even noticed when my family would go hiking.

21
00:01:44,483 --> 00:01:46,720
Rym: But I thought about it a lot when we first moved to New York again.

22
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:53,146
Rym: like it came back into my brain because I noticed you I run over the I've run a lot and I wrote over the bridges and I always started counting like.

23
00:01:53,186 --> 00:01:59,239
Rym: I noticed that I pass a lot more people near the two ends of the bridge But I pass a lot fewer people in the middle of the bridge.

24
00:02:00,261 --> 00:02:03,500
Rym: Mm-hmm, like I think some people start walking up the bridge and just turn around and walk back.

25
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,355
Scott: Mm-hmm so much.

26
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:06,537
Scott: Yeah.

27
00:02:06,678 --> 00:02:06,820
Rym: Yep.

28
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:14,019
Rym: So anyway, the one thing about hiking out in the wilderness is that if you have good charts and trail maps And you know how to orient here like that's one thing.

29
00:02:14,462 --> 00:02:21,680
Rym: But if you're going somewhere where you don't know the trails like you need a trail map And I've realized that a lot of people are the trails can just be really well marked.

30
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,709
Scott: So the map is just inherent in.

31
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:29,360
Rym: well marked is only good for a little baby short hikes though Because if you want to go a long distance, you're gonna have to cobble together a route.

32
00:02:29,621 --> 00:02:35,642
Rym: Nothing is well marked if it's that long or some things aren't like the Appalachian Trail very well marked and you can spend months Hiking that thing.

33
00:02:36,124 --> 00:02:42,304
Scott: Yeah, but there are still areas like there'll be gaps where you're sort of not, you know, yeah Yeah,

34
00:02:42,344 --> 00:02:56,094
Rym: but the point more is that if you want to plan a long hike that gets you back to your car Because you don't you can't like it's not like I could do hiking where we go up with a bunch of people and we leave Cars at both ends of a big hike because we can't go with people.

35
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,160
Rym: that defeats the whole purpose.

36
00:02:57,662 --> 00:03:05,989
Scott: So oh you could go to with with one person to one end another person with the other end And then you just when you pass each other on car keys.

37
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:06,791
Scott: That's keys.

38
00:03:07,313 --> 00:03:09,260
Rym: That's actually not a bad idea.

39
00:03:10,121 --> 00:03:12,331
Scott: So you don't have to retread your your.

40
00:03:12,552 --> 00:03:22,431
Scott: your hike would be the same length But you would be seeing twice as much territory because you yep and it avoids the problem that I was trying to avoid of.

41
00:03:22,873 --> 00:03:30,239
Rym: usually when I do that trick you Together drive up in a bunch of cars and leave cars at places But that defeats the point of avoiding people with kovat.

42
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:34,720
Scott: So that's not just have to be very clear about where the other car is.

43
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,279
Scott: You can find it because I didn't park it and that makes you be like, where is the other car?

44
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,054
Rym: But The problem with hiking and cobbling like making a route to do a loop like.

45
00:03:48,174 --> 00:03:49,298
Rym: I know I want to hike like 20 miles.

46
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,308
Rym: So I go and look at maps.

47
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,480
Rym: There aren't really online maps of trails.

48
00:03:54,461 --> 00:03:55,764
Scott: Yeah, there are in New York State.

49
00:03:55,824 --> 00:03:58,552
Scott: Every trail has like a map website a PDF.

50
00:03:58,973 --> 00:03:59,555
Rym: they do.

51
00:03:59,595 --> 00:04:01,663
Rym: they have a map website or a PDF?

52
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,247
Rym: Yeah, not.

53
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:09,289
Rym: Yeah, those are usually incomplete Or more important they're pretty zoomed.

54
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,656
Scott: they're zoomed out mostly.

55
00:04:10,776 --> 00:04:11,480
Rym: I hike a lot.

56
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,620
Rym: A lot of them are incomplete or they have a map for one particular trail system.

57
00:04:16,002 --> 00:04:17,248
Rym: But we hike far enough to.

58
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:19,380
Rym: we're actually gonna cross through multiple trail systems.

59
00:04:19,702 --> 00:04:21,010
Scott: So you gotta get multiple PDFs.

60
00:04:21,151 --> 00:04:22,400
Rym: you need three different maps.

61
00:04:22,921 --> 00:04:30,607
Rym: But that makes it difficult to plan your route in advance knowing that you have to make a big loop and get back somewhere When you can't like.

62
00:04:30,988 --> 00:04:34,763
Rym: you can't like put it into a GPS tracker and it just shows you the route You can't.

63
00:04:34,984 --> 00:04:38,720
Rym: you have to like line up the maps figure out where this trail system is that trail system starts.

64
00:04:39,081 --> 00:04:43,360
Scott: No, why don't you make an app that fixes that make a hiking app make the hiking Strava and make money?

65
00:04:43,501 --> 00:04:44,246
Rym: So someone did.

66
00:04:44,307 --> 00:04:45,052
Rym: it's called all trails.

67
00:04:45,092 --> 00:04:46,140
Rym: So I tried it out.

68
00:04:47,284 --> 00:04:48,257
Rym: Just doesn't fucking work.

69
00:04:49,224 --> 00:04:50,560
Rym: It costs money doesn't work at all.

70
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,244
Rym: Like get the.

71
00:04:51,285 --> 00:04:53,600
Rym: you're this website and it is really good for free.

72
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:53,801
Rym: Like.

73
00:04:53,821 --> 00:04:57,360
Rym: I'm poking around on it and it shows you like every goddamn trail on earth.

74
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,348
Rym: You just can't use it on your phone like remotely.

75
00:04:59,388 --> 00:05:09,700
Rym: but looking at a website like that's how I figure out Where to go get real trail maps and do the real work, but You have to pay to like get access to like the details and download to your phone.

76
00:05:10,222 --> 00:05:11,429
Rym: So I try to sign up for an account.

77
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,640
Rym: their account sign up just doesn't fucking work on the website.

78
00:05:14,043 --> 00:05:15,754
Rym: It's just like you can't make an account.

79
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:21,003
Scott: you make an account Never make you any app that doesn't suck and make money yeah, but it was.

80
00:05:21,064 --> 00:05:31,499
Rym: it's fascinating to me that this service exists where there's a phone app and if you pay for it and Like use it only on your phone You can make an account and it seems to work.

81
00:05:32,022 --> 00:05:33,870
Rym: But they have a website that does the same thing.

82
00:05:34,633 --> 00:05:36,180
Rym: the website just does not work.

83
00:05:36,381 --> 00:05:39,641
Rym: There is no way to actually make an account on this website It's just.

84
00:05:39,661 --> 00:05:42,089
Scott: it's probably like two people working there if any people.

85
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:51,159
Rym: Yep, if I just made it set it up and then called it a Day, yeah I noticed that a lot with apps where there's like a lot of the biking apps are kind of shitty like that, too.

86
00:05:52,282 --> 00:05:55,540
Scott: I mean most of the but I mean pretty much every crappy biking app is dead.

87
00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:04,720
Scott: The only one that survives that's kind of meh is like ride with GPS, which is sort of like this very weird With GPS, but there's no reason to pay for it.

88
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,566
Scott: But it's like it had and it's all this.

89
00:06:06,727 --> 00:06:10,400
Scott: it's like really garbage II kind of 2000 style app, right?

90
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:12,639
Scott: But it has these features.

91
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,540
Scott: Basically, it's it's almost like its purpose isn't actually to be used.

92
00:06:17,921 --> 00:06:22,637
Scott: Its purpose is to like be the data transfer point for other apps, right?

93
00:06:22,657 --> 00:06:29,300
Scott: So for example Like I for navigation I use my actual biking GPS device, right?

94
00:06:30,102 --> 00:06:48,687
Scott: To load if I want to go on Google Maps and I make a route on Google Maps and I want to load that map into my GPI biking GPS device I basically use a website that converts a Google Maps URL for directions into a special file a route file of some kind.

95
00:06:48,748 --> 00:07:02,020
Scott: if we have the extension is and then I go to ride with GPS and I import the File and I cannot I and then I send it from ride with GPS to my device And then I delete it from ride with GPS because I'm not paying for it.

96
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:09,949
Scott: So it's like I don't have too many features there and it's like it's really just like this data transfer conversion Cloud syncing thing.

97
00:07:09,989 --> 00:07:10,993
Rym: so total aside.

98
00:07:11,114 --> 00:07:16,673
Scott: No one actually uses it I think for to do their actual navigation total aside more businessy.

99
00:07:16,914 --> 00:07:21,366
Rym: that type of service the like Take data from one thing and move it to another thing.

100
00:07:21,828 --> 00:07:26,280
Rym: That is probably like the hottest actual industry in the world right now.

101
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,884
Scott: Yeah, that's like that's where they.

102
00:07:27,924 --> 00:07:35,688
Scott: they basically make all their money because they're like the the sort of central, you know app for You know bike routes, right?

103
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:38,340
Scott: Even though their actual app is kind of garbage.

104
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,891
Scott: They're like, you know, you want to make a route and share it.

105
00:07:40,952 --> 00:07:42,800
Scott: It's like you do it on there, right?

106
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,933
Scott: It's like they're just the Google Drive and everyone else makes word processors.

107
00:07:46,953 --> 00:07:47,194
Rym: Yep.

108
00:07:47,575 --> 00:07:47,936
Scott: They're just.

109
00:07:48,036 --> 00:07:53,806
Scott: they're just like a dropbox for one specific data type And that's that's pretty interesting.

110
00:07:53,846 --> 00:07:57,920
Scott: it's similar to how if you're a DJ there's like the record box.

111
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:58,603
Scott: It's like you might.

112
00:07:58,683 --> 00:08:01,515
Scott: who knows what you know, DJ thing you're using, right?

113
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,760
Scott: You might just be using a pioneer.

114
00:08:03,222 --> 00:08:08,987
Scott: You know DJ set up in the club, right that doesn't connect to a computer It doesn't have to connect to a computer.

115
00:08:09,007 --> 00:08:11,699
Scott: You just connect a USB stick full of songs, right?

116
00:08:12,321 --> 00:08:22,900
Scott: But you use record box to prepare all of your tracks and the cue points and all that stuff in advance And that and there's also Serato and some other competitors.

117
00:08:23,081 --> 00:08:32,268
Scott: But it's like record box is the one that can prepare your files on the USB stick to work with like any Possible DJ equipment, right?

118
00:08:32,328 --> 00:08:35,600
Scott: So there's sort of like the ride with GPS of DJing.

119
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,909
Rym: Yeah, it's interesting like on one hand.

120
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:38,511
Rym: I don't like.

121
00:08:38,933 --> 00:08:42,240
Rym: whenever I see a niche like that I think wow I could do it so much better.

122
00:08:42,561 --> 00:08:46,155
Rym: But then I step back and think do I actually want to be in that business?

123
00:08:46,215 --> 00:08:47,119
Rym: and the answer is always no.

124
00:08:48,043 --> 00:08:48,767
Scott: Well, they've ordered that.

125
00:08:48,787 --> 00:09:00,240
Scott: the problem is that they've already done so much work You know and solved all these problems and you would have to resolve all of those before You could start competing on them with the features that they're failing on.

126
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:05,560
Scott: Yeah, it's like they got all these fundamental things right in that it works, right?

127
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,256
Rym: Well, there's a barrier to entry for competitors in that niche, right?

128
00:09:10,336 --> 00:09:13,040
Scott: It's like they're already handling all the data formats.

129
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,903
Scott: They're doing all this.

130
00:09:13,964 --> 00:09:22,633
Scott: the the core like back-end work correctly of you know Setting things up and it's like people are doing it now using those apps successfully.

131
00:09:23,174 --> 00:09:32,772
Scott: So you not you have to basically perfectly beat that core functionality and Then you can start being like, okay their UI sucks.

132
00:09:33,314 --> 00:09:34,598
Scott: They've never tried to improve it.

133
00:09:35,522 --> 00:09:37,187
Scott: Now you can beat them there, right?

134
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:40,880
Scott: Yep, but you have to match them where they already are from starting from nothing.

135
00:09:41,883 --> 00:09:44,460
Rym: So anyway getting some actual gaming news.

136
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:56,259
Rym: so the problem here is not new but the news is more that it's becoming a growing problem and People are noticing it and it's starting to actively antagonize the chess community.

137
00:09:56,921 --> 00:10:08,052
Rym: Basically people are aim botting the shit out of online chess like everyone's cheating because right well Well chess has become more popular online because people are stuck at home.

138
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:12,231
Scott: Yeah, people are playing more online chess and They're cheating.

139
00:10:12,475 --> 00:10:25,360
Rym: Yeah now It's funny because part of the reason why there's so much outrage about the chess cheating compared to like counter-strike cheating Is that there's this odd perception among just like regular old people that people just cheat at video games.

140
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,324
Rym: That's just what they do.

141
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:32,546
Rym: But somehow my chess that is a more pure engaging exercise of the mind and the.

142
00:10:32,646 --> 00:10:33,368
Rym: I think it's just.

143
00:10:33,588 --> 00:10:40,627
Scott: I think it's just the culture of Cheating like you're only cheating yourself.

144
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:41,189
Scott: Like what's the?

145
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:41,892
Scott: what's the point?

146
00:10:41,952 --> 00:10:44,120
Rym: but counter-strike is the same way like cheating a counter-strike.

147
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,967
Rym: That's not like you can join an e-sport.

148
00:10:46,248 --> 00:10:49,200
Rym: You can't actually play in a tournament if you're a cheater because they'll catch you.

149
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,080
Scott: Well, I think what it is is if you cheat a counter-strike, what are you gonna get for it, right?

150
00:10:53,381 --> 00:10:59,674
Scott: You're super high rank in steam Right something like that, you know, there might be drops and who knows what right?

151
00:10:59,715 --> 00:11:07,400
Scott: but if you cheat at chess The chess ranking system unlike say the counter-strike one actually has like matters, right?

152
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:12,257
Rym: I would argue the counter-strike one does matter in that not as much as the chess one, right?

153
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:18,620
Scott: if I go online I'll play chess and I use the AI helper to be to beat grandmasters, right?

154
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:22,376
Scott: It's like being a chess grandmaster is a huge fucking deal, right?

155
00:11:22,757 --> 00:11:23,360
Scott: It's like they're not.

156
00:11:24,422 --> 00:11:25,889
Scott: You can't cheat your way into that.

157
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:26,291
Scott: Yeah.

158
00:11:26,392 --> 00:11:28,140
Rym: Well, but here's the thing counter-strike.

159
00:11:28,261 --> 00:11:29,126
Rym: What do they really get?

160
00:11:29,186 --> 00:11:31,500
Rym: because people don't really cheat just to get the rank high up.

161
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,793
Rym: Usually we know why they cheat because they're griefing for a lot of reasons.

162
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:37,783
Rym: They're often antagonizing the other players They're having fun like.

163
00:11:39,423 --> 00:11:53,036
Rym: But the interesting thing about this article is that the article talks about not just oh people are cheating and we'll talk about the details That in a second, but the people who are cheating are Sounding and acting and talking and trolling and griefing the same way.

164
00:11:53,136 --> 00:11:54,462
Rym: counter-strike cheaters do.

165
00:11:54,844 --> 00:12:03,780
Rym: they're posting vile chat and like Harassing people when they get caught and disrupting games and it's literally the same crap that happens in video games.

166
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:22,333
Rym: Now like to a tee right down to like the post cheating catch harassment mmm, and The fascinating thing about chess is that on one hand it's impossible to differentiate Effectively between a player who is very good and a player who is cheating.

167
00:12:22,735 --> 00:12:35,837
Rym: because unlike counter-strike Where you could see that a human could not possibly have like tracked a by a head Through a wall with their mouse that they could not see and then gotten the headshot on the first frame.

168
00:12:35,877 --> 00:12:36,459
Rym: It was shootable.

169
00:12:37,661 --> 00:12:38,948
Rym: Chess is just a turn-based game.

170
00:12:39,189 --> 00:12:41,400
Rym: There's no difference between the cheater and a skilled player.

171
00:12:41,721 --> 00:12:48,909
Scott: there's also no technological way to detect a chess cheating because it's just like You're just making your moves.

172
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:50,658
Scott: Your cheating app is off to the side.

173
00:12:50,718 --> 00:12:53,225
Rym: It's not My counter-strike.

174
00:12:53,245 --> 00:12:58,687
Rym: cheat has to be on my computer fucking with my code in some fashion Unless we build the robot they're playing.

175
00:12:58,747 --> 00:13:05,300
Scott: you could play chess on your phone and have a supercomputer next to you That's telling you what move to play and how are they gonna know through the phone?

176
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,060
Scott: The phone is this thinks you're playing chess.

177
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:12,320
Scott: It doesn't have any connection physical or electronic connection to the cheating computer.

178
00:13:12,421 --> 00:13:18,345
Scott: The cheating computers is a monitor that tells you what move to make Responding to someone on the stream.

179
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:19,228
Rym: I'll get to that in a second.

180
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,739
Rym: someone paid money to say words to us.

181
00:13:22,842 --> 00:13:24,318
Scott: Why don't you have something better to do?

182
00:13:25,082 --> 00:13:25,443
Rym: That'll be.

183
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:26,708
Rym: that'll be a news at the end of this.

184
00:13:26,769 --> 00:13:26,929
Rym: what?

185
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,335
Rym: what they said, don't worry.

186
00:13:28,576 --> 00:13:29,620
Rym: Okay, he's nothing bad.

187
00:13:30,324 --> 00:13:37,940
Rym: but uh, the prop the cool part is it Effectively is actually trivial to catch chess cheaters.

188
00:13:38,441 --> 00:13:54,240
Rym: Because while it is true that chess is meta is stagnant and that humans will probably never Bring anything to the table in chess again Unless we change the rules of chess or play chess in a different format like a eyes will always be humans forever, but that's done.

189
00:13:55,028 --> 00:14:00,780
Rym: Yep, a eyes The only way humans can get better is by playing more and more like a eyes.

190
00:14:01,021 --> 00:14:07,960
Rym: So you can't even do something like if a human does stuff that is very similar to the weird things that only a eyes do.

191
00:14:08,342 --> 00:14:11,200
Rym: They're likely cribbing from an AI and we can catch them.

192
00:14:11,561 --> 00:14:18,562
Rym: That doesn't work because grandmasters are literally studying a eyes and trying to learn the AI techniques Mm-hmm.

193
00:14:19,224 --> 00:14:24,680
Rym: So and those AI techniques even worse almost always lead to draws like that's the the end game of chess.

194
00:14:25,022 --> 00:14:25,825
Rym: Everything's a draw.

195
00:14:26,348 --> 00:14:27,513
Rym: that that's the fundamental.

196
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,754
Rym: we've talked about this a lot on GeekNights But I'm gonna cheat at chess, right?

197
00:14:30,835 --> 00:14:35,999
Scott: All I want to do I'm probably gonna be able to win unless the other person is also cheating right up.

198
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,544
Scott: Why set your at?

199
00:14:37,564 --> 00:14:39,891
Scott: you're helping AI that you're using to cheat with.

200
00:14:40,392 --> 00:14:42,217
Scott: don't set it at grandmaster level.

201
00:14:42,358 --> 00:14:46,353
Scott: set it like Less than one master like not even master.

202
00:14:46,373 --> 00:14:47,076
Scott: You know what that's like.

203
00:14:47,096 --> 00:14:48,000
Rym: pretty good level.

204
00:14:49,481 --> 00:14:55,620
Rym: It's like the counter-strike cheat that just moves your mouse a little bit before you like when you click before it fires.

205
00:14:56,001 --> 00:15:00,778
Rym: So you're like get a little bit of an aimbot but not a like pistol shot from across the map.

206
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:06,561
Rym: aimbot Not a. I'm in your spawn with a knife somehow before the match started cheat Mm-hmm.

207
00:15:07,445 --> 00:15:10,235
Rym: Oh god, imagine the chess cheater who's just like I just keep moving my pawns.

208
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:10,938
Rym: You can't stop me.

209
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:11,400
Rym: Here they come.

210
00:15:15,001 --> 00:15:20,944
Rym: But the way they're detecting them is basically if Someone is too good.

211
00:15:21,164 --> 00:15:23,212
Rym: Like if they're master or grandmaster level.

212
00:15:23,232 --> 00:15:31,975
Rym: if they're playing at that level in any chess app 99% of the time they're cheating because the community of people who are actually that good is so small

213
00:15:31,996 --> 00:15:32,316
Scott: small

214
00:15:32,718 --> 00:15:41,100
Rym: and nobody is Going to join one of these chess apps and start playing at that level without having been noticed by the real chess community before that.

215
00:15:41,461 --> 00:15:44,089
Scott: So basically it's like so to compare it to counter-strike.

216
00:15:44,169 --> 00:15:45,835
Scott: It would be like rather than saying.

217
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,520
Scott: Well, we saw you aimbotting.

218
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:51,834
Scott: It's like look your kill death ratio is like a hundred to one.

219
00:15:52,316 --> 00:15:53,600
Scott: Nobody is that good.

220
00:15:54,022 --> 00:15:54,847
Scott: We can just see that.

221
00:15:54,888 --> 00:15:56,920
Scott: we just know that you're cheating just by that.

222
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:05,600
Scott: It's like when you're playing pac-man and you look at the leaderboards just for score and you see a score That's like a billion and it's like nobody can get a billion.

223
00:16:05,701 --> 00:16:05,862
Scott: That's.

224
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,420
Scott: I don't even need to see what you did when you played pac-man.

225
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,490
Scott: I know that you're cheating because nobody can get that score.

226
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:18,800
Rym: so you can actually move at least with chess cheating to above a certain line like above an egregiousness of chess cheating.

227
00:16:19,162 --> 00:16:29,463
Rym: You could do a guilty until proven innocent model for people who are costs Exactly, and that seems to be what they're doing and I bet it'll work What I write.

228
00:16:29,483 --> 00:16:34,260
Scott: they're smart enough to be chess grandmasters, they're smart enough to figure this out exactly as best possible.

229
00:16:34,943 --> 00:16:38,820
Rym: But what's interesting is what about all the people who are cheating at a lower level?

230
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:44,360
Rym: Like I don't think you can stop that the way you can in a non turn-based game.

231
00:16:44,721 --> 00:16:45,505
Scott: I don't think you can.

232
00:16:45,826 --> 00:16:48,840
Scott: but I think it also doesn't matter because there's nothing to be earned by cheating.

233
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:54,718
Scott: Like I said, if I was gonna undetectedly cheat by just slightly improving my own people do that all the time.

234
00:16:54,778 --> 00:16:55,480
Rym: That's that service.

235
00:16:55,821 --> 00:16:56,343
Rym: It's not a news.

236
00:16:56,363 --> 00:17:00,640
Rym: people were paying for that destiny cheat that just made them better without getting them caught.

237
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:05,936
Scott: Yep, and it's like sure do that and it's like but it doesn't win you anything in life.

238
00:17:06,037 --> 00:17:06,700
Scott: So it's like.

239
00:17:07,641 --> 00:17:08,404
Scott: You know, you're not gonna.

240
00:17:08,704 --> 00:17:10,634
Rym: well, what's in a tournament like that?

241
00:17:10,714 --> 00:17:12,119
Scott: and get and win a money prize?

242
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:12,862
Rym: well, even better.

243
00:17:12,882 --> 00:17:21,570
Rym: what I've realized is that unlike counter-stroke cheating with this chess cheating if someone cheats a little bit, uh, It doesn't matter because I'm playing online.

244
00:17:21,651 --> 00:17:23,179
Rym: It's I might as well be playing against an AI.

245
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:26,039
Rym: Anyway, it doesn't matter that I'm playing chess against a human anymore.

246
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:30,199
Rym: Mm-hmm, like chess a eyes are just fine.

247
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:32,349
Rym: Pick your pick how difficult you want it to be.

248
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:39,794
Rym: if a human is augmenting themselves with an AI They're just playing like that slightly harder AI or a human who's at that level.

249
00:17:40,115 --> 00:17:41,860
Rym: So it actually doesn't matter at all.

250
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:51,788
Scott: It doesn't actually disrupt my experience in any way because you can't create disrupts their rankings because the serious non cheating people are also playing Serious truly competitive chess online.

251
00:17:51,848 --> 00:17:59,059
Scott: and now suddenly you look at the grandmaster rankings and it's like, okay We see everyone all the real grandmasters are there on the same site, too.

252
00:17:59,562 --> 00:18:01,759
Scott: Ah, and it's like suddenly this randos mixed in there.

253
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,088
Rym: But those randos will get weeded out by the.

254
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,596
Rym: you're not actually a grandmaster guilty until proven innocent.

255
00:18:06,616 --> 00:18:08,744
Rym: What if someone is Then they'll get.

256
00:18:09,106 --> 00:18:10,451
Rym: that'll get sorted out pretty quick.

257
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:12,860
Rym: There's a lot of ways to solve that problem.

258
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:17,938
Rym: And if someone just gets lost in the woods like lost in the weeds, they're the edge case.

259
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:18,400
Rym: that sucks.

260
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:23,040
Rym: But just like counter-strike you might get banned when you're not cheating because he did something.

261
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:27,959
Scott: It also messes up the the person who maybe truly is a grandmaster, right?

262
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:32,431
Scott: And now because I mean because they might get eel they're using elo, right?

263
00:18:32,471 --> 00:18:35,300
Scott: They might get elo'd out by the cheaters and not rise.

264
00:18:36,341 --> 00:18:37,626
Rym: Seems like they don't really like.

265
00:18:37,686 --> 00:18:41,500
Rym: those grandmasters are not playing in the tournaments with the people who might be cheating and vice versa.

266
00:18:41,963 --> 00:18:47,328
Rym: This is mostly affecting regular people playing chess Whatever and enthusiasts where it wouldn't matter.

267
00:18:47,648 --> 00:18:57,835
Rym: if you see if everyone cheats to get to like a certain level that's below the threshold of cheating detection Then you just have to naturally get better enough to get above that on your own.

268
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,288
Scott: I Think it's just clear that it's not just chess.

269
00:19:01,368 --> 00:19:09,271
Scott: But basically any online game and with with the advent of The computer right perfect information games.

270
00:19:09,371 --> 00:19:12,020
Scott: I think are not long for this world.

271
00:19:12,341 --> 00:19:18,729
Rym: Yep, so like that you play them out and chess is basically it could be played out But you can read this article to see more info.

272
00:19:19,635 --> 00:19:20,359
Rym: So you got any news?

273
00:19:21,801 --> 00:19:23,086
Scott: I do have a news a tiny news.

274
00:19:23,126 --> 00:19:25,053
Scott: So Sega's anniversary is going down.

275
00:19:25,174 --> 00:19:26,780
Scott: and what they doing for their anniversary?

276
00:19:26,902 --> 00:19:30,140
Scott: I don't know if it's almost over They're on Steam.

277
00:19:30,301 --> 00:19:37,171
Scott: They got some tiny free games and they put out one game a day and you just had to click and grab it while it Was still available before it goes away.

278
00:19:37,191 --> 00:19:38,600
Scott: and then you've got the game forever.

279
00:19:39,624 --> 00:19:40,808
Scott: And some of these games are cute.

280
00:19:40,868 --> 00:19:47,280
Scott: there was like a. there was like a Streets of Rage side scroller But it was Yakuza themed combining two Sega franchises.

281
00:19:48,002 --> 00:19:55,315
Scott: They were just giving Sonic the Hedgehog 2 for a PC just for free and I guess if you you know, whatever You just emulate it, right?

282
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:02,500
Scott: But one of the games was golden axed as in the past tense you got axed, right?

283
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:08,507
Scott: And this is apparently some prototype Golden axe game that never.

284
00:20:08,528 --> 00:20:09,371
Scott: it was never released.

285
00:20:09,431 --> 00:20:22,840
Scott: way back when when it was made and Because they didn't like the prototype They just made it and didn't release it and it was you know, sort of a more bloody Gory kind of golden axe right like, you know, you chop someone's head off at the axe and blood spews or whatever.

286
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,153
Scott: I didn't play it, but that's what I heard.

287
00:20:24,173 --> 00:20:26,423
Scott: Yeah And they're.

288
00:20:26,443 --> 00:20:27,206
Scott: they're like, you know what.

289
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:30,180
Scott: we'll dig this thing out of our vault and we'll release it to the world.

290
00:20:30,442 --> 00:20:34,505
Scott: Hey everyone, it's gonna be buggy and janky We know but you know what.

291
00:20:35,087 --> 00:20:36,290
Scott: it's free for you.

292
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:47,455
Scott: and as to celebrate our anniversary and I think that's pretty cool I wish I'm sure Nintendo's got a lot of stuff in the vault I would love to play janky like vertical slices of Nintendo concepts that never made it.

293
00:20:48,297 --> 00:20:49,160
Scott: I mean, I know right.

294
00:20:49,321 --> 00:20:52,853
Scott: so if they released that for an anniversary of Sega, that would be awesome.

295
00:20:52,873 --> 00:20:53,737
Scott: or Nintendo, right.

296
00:20:54,339 --> 00:20:56,172
Scott: so What happens?

297
00:20:56,233 --> 00:20:57,040
Scott: is somebody?

298
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:07,452
Scott: the person who largely was responsible for golden axed Right comes out on Twitter and tells the real story about how.

299
00:21:07,492 --> 00:21:18,680
Rym: basically, you know typical game industry story Executives who don't know what the fuck they want Seven day work weeks to force this game to get like this vertical slice to get right.

300
00:21:18,821 --> 00:21:23,020
Scott: They overwork this dude a zillion hours to crank this thing out.

301
00:21:23,301 --> 00:21:25,352
Scott: You know, he didn't make what they asked for.

302
00:21:25,473 --> 00:21:26,760
Scott: They didn't even know what they wanted.

303
00:21:27,302 --> 00:21:30,392
Scott: Given the runaround then they never even released the thing.

304
00:21:30,753 --> 00:21:32,760
Scott: It's like a dark memory for this, dude.

305
00:21:34,061 --> 00:21:40,713
Scott: And then they had to go and say oh, you know like insulting it when they released it like oh, it's all janky and buggy and broken right.

306
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:45,330
Scott: and he's like Opened up the old wounds here.

307
00:21:45,391 --> 00:21:50,660
Rym: on one hand work for hire Like I think this guy's right in this case because the crunch problem.

308
00:21:50,720 --> 00:22:00,680
Rym: But if I made something janky for my job and at some point the company released it For free or prepare whatever and admitted how janky it was like that's work for hire.

309
00:22:00,982 --> 00:22:02,711
Rym: That's what happens when you're working for someone else like.

310
00:22:02,751 --> 00:22:04,179
Rym: that's not that big a deal.

311
00:22:04,641 --> 00:22:20,112
Rym: But the fact that they did this for something that they also forced this dude to work to 14-hour seven day weeks to make that is the problem that the Crunch is never ever justified in the video game industry.

312
00:22:20,152 --> 00:22:22,118
Rym: if that means a bunch of triple-a studios go bankrupt.

313
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:23,998
Rym: Fuck them That's right.

314
00:22:24,981 --> 00:22:26,626
Scott: And that thing is the crunch.

315
00:22:26,706 --> 00:22:31,460
Scott: it's like, okay, we made you work super overtime or nothing release, right?

316
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:32,262
Scott: It's like it.

317
00:22:32,302 --> 00:22:34,410
Scott: may you know, it might barely make it.

318
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:36,920
Scott: All right, so let's think of a case where crunch might make sense.

319
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,890
Scott: All right, let's say you and I follow 13 is happening right now.

320
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:42,237
Scott: We need the astrophysicist to work.

321
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:47,109
Scott: Yeah Engineers to stay on the clock to save the astronauts live.

322
00:22:47,229 --> 00:22:48,934
Scott: that's acceptable.

323
00:22:48,994 --> 00:22:50,137
Rym: game 7 of the Stanley Cup.

324
00:22:50,197 --> 00:22:51,240
Rym: I work for the Rangers.

325
00:22:51,601 --> 00:22:52,866
Rym: They're like they're in it.

326
00:22:53,388 --> 00:22:54,332
Rym: Like that's the curl.

327
00:22:54,352 --> 00:22:56,360
Rym: you're gonna work as long as that overtime takes.

328
00:22:57,083 --> 00:23:00,120
Scott: Yeah, but even then and the lead-up is something more, right?

329
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,174
Scott: But even in that case compared to the people's lives are on the line.

330
00:23:03,195 --> 00:23:09,520
Scott: Apollo 13 case Right the Stanley Cup while very very important is not life and death.

331
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,174
Scott: So if something more important comes up like, you know some major you can leave you don't.

332
00:23:14,696 --> 00:23:16,585
Scott: there's no reason to you know Hurt yourself.

333
00:23:16,826 --> 00:23:18,580
Scott: Yeah, you work really hard.

334
00:23:18,661 --> 00:23:25,560
Scott: You might work a few extra hours But there's no reason to sacrifice your body or your life or true anything for the Stanley Cup.

335
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:30,346
Rym: Like there's a reason why there's a concussion protocol, even if the player wants right play We don't let them right.

336
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:33,460
Scott: you push yourself to your limit in that case and then stop, right?

337
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,285
Scott: There's no reason to go over.

338
00:23:34,426 --> 00:23:35,816
Scott: Here's a video game.

339
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:42,046
Rym: you and I you and I are making tribes 2 - and Yeah, like for summaries like we got.

340
00:23:42,086 --> 00:23:45,979
Rym: we work extra hours to get it done because it's a we were passionate about it.

341
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:47,519
Scott: We're not working but we're not good.

342
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,294
Scott: There's no reason to hurt ourselves or sacrifice our bodies.

343
00:23:50,575 --> 00:23:51,480
Scott: or you know.

344
00:23:51,640 --> 00:24:02,860
Scott: Even if there's some sort of deadline like we're back in the day where we have to push CDs or something Yeah, and we need to get it to the CD manufacturer the gold copy by a certain time or otherwise.

345
00:24:03,061 --> 00:24:03,442
Scott: You know the.

346
00:24:04,165 --> 00:24:07,980
Scott: the game will have to be delayed by several months and then you know problems, right?

347
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:18,339
Scott: Okay, that might justify a little bit of overworking but hopefully we didn't fuck up to begin with and we're on time also as we didn't manage anything poorly previously.

348
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:29,340
Rym: in Functional like sane industry is the way that works is if you work a lot of extra overtime to get something done You either get a bunch of extra time off or compensation the video game industry.

349
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:32,636
Rym: Usually you just get fired and your game comes done.

350
00:24:32,656 --> 00:24:32,857
Rym: Yep.

351
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:39,686
Scott: That's right And you know, but for a game that is never released for a prototype for a demo There is no reason to have.

352
00:24:39,706 --> 00:24:41,071
Scott: you know, I mean there should.

353
00:24:41,111 --> 00:24:45,532
Scott: I guess it would be unreasonable to work on a prototype You don't even know you're gonna make for several months.

354
00:24:45,573 --> 00:24:46,600
Scott: That would be kind of ridiculous.

355
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:52,580
Rym: Well that actually is common and fine, but it's not common and fine to do that for several months with crunched hours.

356
00:24:53,721 --> 00:24:56,020
Scott: Right, but I'm saying it's like, you know, we don't even know if we're gonna do this thing.

357
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,460
Scott: Am I really gonna pay someone for months to make a prototype?

358
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,920
Scott: It's like just make it crappier and make it faster.

359
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,400
Scott: That way we can decide sooner whether we want to keep going with it.

360
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:07,710
Rym: Well that I always go back to a philosophy I've had in careers and like think everyone should follow in their whole life.

361
00:25:08,011 --> 00:25:11,203
Rym: if someone's paying you to do something you can like And it's rich.

362
00:25:11,284 --> 00:25:12,067
Rym: It's not crunch.

363
00:25:12,107 --> 00:25:13,755
Rym: Like it's normal 40-hour workweek.

364
00:25:14,277 --> 00:25:14,859
Rym: It's their money.

365
00:25:16,064 --> 00:25:21,253
Scott: yeah, sure, but Why I'm saying doing that is silly but to crunch on a thing.

366
00:25:21,293 --> 00:25:23,400
Scott: You're not sure is gonna be a real thing.

367
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:27,234
Scott: Yeah, where there is there it's like there's no deadline because you didn't even make it.

368
00:25:27,294 --> 00:25:29,277
Scott: so it didn't matter whether you did it or not.

369
00:25:30,261 --> 00:25:31,739
Scott: That's really kind of effed up.

370
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:36,680
Rym: Yep, like this could have just been delayed a couple weeks and that guy could cost you.

371
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,951
Scott: The point is it costs you nothing to play golden axed.

372
00:25:40,012 --> 00:25:41,880
Scott: So it doesn't benefit Sega really in any way.

373
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,320
Scott: So go ahead and install golden axed and try it out.

374
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,392
Scott: I didn't try it out yet, but I clicked on it on Steam.

375
00:25:46,412 --> 00:25:46,875
Scott: So I have it.

376
00:25:47,619 --> 00:25:48,787
Rym: Oh, yeah I didn't click on it on Steam.

377
00:25:48,827 --> 00:25:49,250
Rym: I guess I could.

378
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:52,102
Scott: I don't know if you There's like.

379
00:25:52,303 --> 00:25:53,347
Scott: there's a. you have to check.

380
00:25:53,428 --> 00:25:54,552
Scott: There's a. there's a brief window.

381
00:25:54,613 --> 00:25:57,286
Rym: I think yeah, I'll go check out whatever I like.

382
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:59,439
Scott: you can just play regular golden X. It's probably way better.

383
00:26:00,541 --> 00:26:02,488
Rym: So let's play arcade like golden X again.

384
00:26:02,548 --> 00:26:04,195
Rym: I'm good times with that game.

385
00:26:04,777 --> 00:26:07,635
Scott: You'll like golden X. We don't like any of you don't like streets of rage.

386
00:26:08,762 --> 00:26:10,146
Rym: I think the part of it was.

387
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:12,052
Rym: I only like golden X when I was kid.

388
00:26:12,093 --> 00:26:16,718
Rym: kid brain and fantasy was more important to me than street fight.

389
00:26:18,121 --> 00:26:22,075
Scott: All right, so thematically sure that was pretty much it right around on the animals in golden access.

390
00:26:22,316 --> 00:26:34,018
Rym: I was like 11 Also my main memory of golden X. we were kicking that game's ass and we were taking turns putting quarters into it and Someone kicked the machine and we knocked the plug out.

391
00:26:35,582 --> 00:26:42,173
Scott: And to this we never figured out who kicked it out At least the D&D one and River City Ransom of actual RPG elements.

392
00:26:42,213 --> 00:26:44,280
Scott: golden X is just walk sideways and hit things.

393
00:26:44,381 --> 00:26:46,980
Rym: Honestly, the D&D one was I as a kid.

394
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:51,279
Rym: I remember it being better, but there's only one arcade that had it so I didn't get to play it as much.

395
00:26:51,603 --> 00:26:58,229
Rym: There's two D&D ones Yeah, the one where you could take the path to fight the red dragon Both of them or you could go the other side.

396
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:59,559
Scott: It's both pretty sure that's both.

397
00:26:59,639 --> 00:27:01,129
Rym: Yeah I don't remember which one switch at all.

398
00:27:01,149 --> 00:27:05,648
Rym: It was a. it was a Cocktail cabinet and it was in a pizza parlor.

399
00:27:05,889 --> 00:27:07,354
Rym: They also had an afterburner machine.

400
00:27:07,675 --> 00:27:09,040
Scott: We played the whole game at RIT.

401
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:09,722
Scott: We beat it.

402
00:27:10,384 --> 00:27:11,970
Rym: I vaguely remember that one of them.

403
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:13,736
Scott: I forget which one it was one of.

404
00:27:13,776 --> 00:27:14,880
Rym: don't remember which one it was.

405
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,710
Rym: So anyway, it's a blast news.

406
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:18,414
Rym: a while ago.

407
00:27:18,454 --> 00:27:24,860
Rym: We talked about how Facebook requiring Facebook accounts on oculus VR Oculus

408
00:27:25,081 --> 00:27:26,165
Scott: Yes was

409
00:27:26,285 --> 00:27:36,740
Rym: causing problems and that a lot of VR developers were Reconsidering their plans to release stuff on that platform and a lot of gamers are like getting rid of their headsets Or planning to get rid of their headsets.

410
00:27:37,202 --> 00:27:44,391
Scott: So I did see some people a lot of people on Twitter buying like, you know quest twos with various Reactions positive and negative.

411
00:27:44,411 --> 00:27:45,860
Rym: Yeah, the quest two is good hardware.

412
00:27:46,204 --> 00:27:47,115
Rym: I'll say that for it.

413
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,122
Rym: But

414
00:27:48,363 --> 00:27:52,339
Scott: I saw some complaints about the hardware aspects as well and some positive things, you know,

415
00:27:52,399 --> 00:28:05,431
Rym: yeah But apparently it is interesting because the split I see is People like me and people are more close to the games industry are generally more down on the oculus quest to people who are Less into gaming and this is their first VR.

416
00:28:05,472 --> 00:28:07,139
Rym: They don't really know or think about it.

417
00:28:07,662 --> 00:28:09,794
Rym: they just get it have a Facebook account don't even think about it.

418
00:28:09,895 --> 00:28:14,355
Rym: totally fine and At least for now the lot like steam just works with it.

419
00:28:14,416 --> 00:28:15,139
Rym: Everything just works.

420
00:28:15,922 --> 00:28:19,793
Rym: But the problem a bunch of people are having and upload VR is an article about.

421
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:21,980
Rym: it is a lot of people bought it.

422
00:28:22,484 --> 00:28:24,139
Rym: Who don't have Facebook accounts?

423
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:33,478
Rym: Not because they're like me and they hate Facebook because they're young and they never thought to make a Facebook account Mmm, so they go to make a Facebook account.

424
00:28:34,102 --> 00:28:39,400
Rym: Facebook has a backlog of Creating new accounts because they require proof of identity and all that nonsense.

425
00:28:39,621 --> 00:28:45,180
Rym: Like they'll lock your account out if they think it's suspicious and that I never provided that you have to do for a new account.

426
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:45,905
Scott: You have to do that.

427
00:28:45,945 --> 00:28:48,060
Rym: There's all sorts of nonsense in Facebook.

428
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:51,180
Scott: You can't just make a Facebook account and then you're good.

429
00:28:51,441 --> 00:28:58,240
Rym: So Facebook accounts can get disabled if they're reviewed and Facebook isn't sure that you're an actual individual, right?

430
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,991
Scott: So that that's what I thought is that it was a post.

431
00:29:00,092 --> 00:29:01,220
Scott: It's not a pre thing.

432
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,507
Scott: It's a post thing that you.

433
00:29:02,527 --> 00:29:08,159
Scott: they may give you your account and then you know You verify your email or whatever people are getting they might disable it.

434
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:16,099
Rym: People are making new accounts that are getting disabled pretty or pretty quickly Because they only made the account for Facebook VR and they don't use it for anything else.

435
00:29:17,182 --> 00:29:17,744
Scott: That makes sense.

436
00:29:17,764 --> 00:29:31,100
Rym: Yeah, so if that happens and you don't like send them photos and do all the stuff You have to do or even if you do it and they don't believe you your accounts just disabled permanently Fuck you, and now you cannot even boot your quest to.

437
00:29:32,261 --> 00:29:32,963
Scott: Yeah, it makes sense.

438
00:29:32,983 --> 00:29:48,533
Rym: Yeah, and there's a huge huge story here of a bunch of people who basically returned them or Had to charge back their credit cards or otherwise could not use their oculus quest to because Facebook either disabled their account or wouldn't let them access an account.

439
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:50,720
Rym: They hadn't used in a long time and they're just fucked.

440
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,455
Rym: Mmm, I just it'll be interesting to see what Facebook does about that.

441
00:29:55,475 --> 00:29:57,605
Scott: I Did they care that much?

442
00:29:57,906 --> 00:30:00,379
Scott: Yeah oculus is not a large part of their money.

443
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:06,240
Scott: Yep, and as much as they know the actual number of people this happened to is probably small in the grand scheme.

444
00:30:06,561 --> 00:30:16,025
Rym: Well, especially considering the the demographic that I think would likely be hit most by this are young people who don't even like care about Facebook or think about Facebook.

445
00:30:16,547 --> 00:30:17,991
Scott: and where did those people get that much money?

446
00:30:18,031 --> 00:30:18,854
Scott: to buy VR from?

447
00:30:18,874 --> 00:30:20,299
Rym: their parents probably bought it for him.

448
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:24,868
Rym: maybe VR is pretty hot right now because people are stuck at home.

449
00:30:25,009 --> 00:30:28,620
Rym: It's actually selling way better than it was previously.

450
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,609
Rym: Maybe I mean it is we have numbers.

451
00:30:31,629 --> 00:30:32,633
Rym: It's not hmm.

452
00:30:32,975 --> 00:30:34,080
Scott: Yeah, where's your where these number?

453
00:30:39,271 --> 00:30:42,470
Rym: But anyway Things of the day.

454
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:43,595
Rym: the listener made this video.

455
00:30:43,856 --> 00:30:45,605
Rym: It's what a link to this video it is.

456
00:30:45,645 --> 00:30:52,049
Rym: they took the panel we did at the crunchyroll Expo and they They made a super cut of it.

457
00:30:52,591 --> 00:30:53,394
Rym: So they cut it down.

458
00:30:53,455 --> 00:31:07,294
Rym: They distilled our 59 panel to 59 seconds is a 59 second distillation of our judge anime by its cover panel And it's actually pretty great and pretty funny.

459
00:31:07,495 --> 00:31:08,240
Rym: This is worth watching.

460
00:31:10,443 --> 00:31:13,980
Scott: Okay, I know who the listener is by the way, but I'm telling yeah, I've just used the listener.

461
00:31:15,064 --> 00:31:15,555
Scott: Yeah, sure.

462
00:31:17,143 --> 00:31:18,072
Scott: So yeah my thing of the day.

463
00:31:18,113 --> 00:31:20,841
Scott: so the Pusheen Channel.

464
00:31:21,022 --> 00:31:25,535
Scott: they Pusheen much like yeek nights is on every single internet channel.

465
00:31:25,575 --> 00:31:26,418

Scott: Pusheen has an account and they post there and what Pusheen does.

470
00:31:33,395 --> 00:31:34,519
Scott: pretty much every week or so.

471
00:31:35,161 --> 00:31:49,100
Scott: They'll post something and they'll make like a new Pusheen content and they will format that content for each platform Especially so that like, you know on YouTube It'll be a video and then you'll go to Instagram and you'll see like a single animated gif.

472
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:51,207
Scott: That's basically the same content is a video.

473
00:31:51,508 --> 00:31:54,599
Scott: Yeah, and it's sort of like these four panel cute Pusheen's.

474
00:31:54,659 --> 00:32:03,088
Scott: however For Halloween and to promote their Bousheen, which is sold out I don't know if it'll come back in stock at any point.

475
00:32:03,809 --> 00:32:09,403
Scott: They have made a full cute animation of Bousheen in the haunted house.

476
00:32:09,543 --> 00:32:10,706
Rym: the skeleton is great.

477
00:32:11,468 --> 00:32:13,634
Scott: Yeah, and it's it's only on YouTube.

478
00:32:13,654 --> 00:32:16,799
Scott: I did not see this on any other Bousheen platform.

479
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:26,580
Scott: so Go to the official Pusheen YouTube channel and watch this tiny cute Halloween animation that is high quality.

480
00:32:27,285 --> 00:32:28,293
Rym: It is tiny and cute.

481
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:32,597
Rym: in the moment The book club book is still the tale of Hanzo because we're just not reading books right now.

482
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:36,204
Rym: Stay tuned But I don't know.

483
00:32:36,244 --> 00:32:44,336
Scott: I've been I've been feeling a book reading mood, but it's telling me to read Like fantasy sci-fi novel and I'm like no if we're gonna read any.

484
00:32:44,416 --> 00:32:45,180
Scott: I still haven't read anything.

485
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:49,678
Rym: But if we do read something I was about to say you read any fiction that is not the tale of Genji.

486
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:52,310
Scott: Fuck you That's right, I got to read that one.

487
00:32:52,451 --> 00:32:53,980
Rym: I can't read the tale of Genji.

488
00:32:54,061 --> 00:32:55,328
Rym: I just don't have time to read anything.

489
00:32:55,872 --> 00:33:01,493
Rym: I mean I do too, but it's You know, yeah, I'm not the only thing I'm feeling to read like.

490
00:33:01,554 --> 00:33:03,100
Rym: I want to read a bunch of stuff including this.

491
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:06,856
Rym: But the only things I'm actually reading are still nonfiction right now for a lot of reasons.

492
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:07,920
Scott: and read the internet.

493
00:33:08,001 --> 00:33:08,524
Scott: That's what I read.

494
00:33:08,645 --> 00:33:10,780
Rym: Yep, but another meta moment.

495
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:18,048
Rym: Danny the listener on the stream paid $4.99 to make sure Your five dollars.

496
00:33:18,128 --> 00:33:20,160
Scott: you could do something better with those five dollars.

497
00:33:20,461 --> 00:33:24,760
Scott: He wants to know like any Democratic campaign for credit for anything.

498
00:33:25,202 --> 00:33:27,919
Rym: Well, this is a question that gets asked a lot on the YouTube channel.

499
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:28,943
Rym: I keep trying.

500
00:33:28,983 --> 00:33:31,412
Rym: we got disrupted on doing and following up on this.

501
00:33:31,994 --> 00:33:33,560
Rym: Will the utenna series continue?

502
00:33:35,982 --> 00:33:42,439
Rym: Now the answer is yes, like we do want to continue it, uh We just got to actually do it with our remote setup.

503
00:33:44,023 --> 00:33:45,174
Rym: Mmm, you want to do it this weekend.

504
00:33:45,234 --> 00:33:45,779
Rym: want to record one?

505
00:33:46,722 --> 00:33:48,340
Rym: No, you want to watch one this weekend?

506
00:33:49,941 --> 00:33:51,573
Scott: Yeah, I don't remember which one we're on.

507
00:33:51,755 --> 00:33:52,480
Rym: We're in Black Rose.

508
00:33:53,525 --> 00:33:56,499
Rym: Yeah, I know that We're actually just getting to another good duel.

509
00:33:58,602 --> 00:33:59,839
Scott: Isn't every duel a good do holder?

510
00:34:00,081 --> 00:34:02,913
Rym: Well, no, cuz the Black Rose has a bunch of non-dual episodes before the duel.

511
00:34:02,933 --> 00:34:04,400
Scott: Oh, yeah every other episode, whatever.

512
00:34:05,942 --> 00:34:07,855
Rym: All right, if you want to know maybe I'll just do one by myself.

513
00:34:07,936 --> 00:34:10,934
Scott: this weekend He's gonna make videos by yourself.

514
00:34:10,954 --> 00:34:11,739
Rym: I'd be pretty easy to do.

515
00:34:12,041 --> 00:34:21,840
Rym: The only reason it's hard is that both of us have to watch it and then we have to record it together Which because of kovat takes the same amount of effort as recording an entire goddamn panel.

516
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,667
Scott: It's not like yes makes no effort.

517
00:34:24,887 --> 00:34:35,587
Rym: I do ten of videos take a lot of work to do more work than even a panel Yeah, but the pre-production of a new ten up before kovat only took about Twice as much effort as a podcast like.

518
00:34:35,607 --> 00:34:44,695
Rym: we just have to sit down and like record the thing and then the rest of the Is me spending a few days like editing and futzing with it, but now the pre-production.

519
00:34:44,815 --> 00:34:52,300
Scott: they're also you know While I'm sure our utenna content was very good or at least good ish, right?

520
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,692
Scott: there are people who do exactly that way way way better than us.

521
00:34:55,752 --> 00:34:59,426
Scott: go check out empty movement on Twitter and Like.

522
00:34:59,467 --> 00:35:02,688
Scott: they are way more Utenna expert than we ever will be.

523
00:35:02,709 --> 00:35:05,520
Scott: you can why you don't need to come to us for that.

524
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,067
Scott: You can go to someone else for that like.

525
00:35:07,429 --> 00:35:09,600
Scott: so they're a hundred percent utenna all the time.

526
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:21,849
Rym: Yep, listeners have basically said in our YouTube channel Effectively the thing we do that's different is that we go for a really long time about an individual episode With no one else.

527
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:23,843
Rym: does that not really Like?

528
00:35:23,863 --> 00:35:25,815
Rym: we go way clips get copyright strike.

529
00:35:25,856 --> 00:35:26,540
Scott: So that's a problem.

530
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,344
Rym: Yep, I did.

531
00:35:27,364 --> 00:35:30,440
Rym: I did get around that because the last one we uploaded where I did.

532
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,949
Rym: So I made some changes to how I did the clips.

533
00:35:31,989 --> 00:35:33,800
Rym: I got far fewer copyright strikes.

534
00:35:34,621 --> 00:35:35,748
Scott: That's okay didn't?

535
00:35:35,768 --> 00:35:35,970
Rym: actually?

536
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:37,500
Rym: I actually fought all the strikes and won.

537
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:41,760
Rym: It was just a pain in the ass and I had to open myself up to significant legal liability, but so far it worked.

538
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,265
Rym: Okay, I will try to.

539
00:35:45,747 --> 00:35:46,930
Rym: basically it's at this point.

540
00:35:46,971 --> 00:35:49,539
Rym: it's a matter of is Scott willing to do it cuz I'm ready.

541
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:51,206
Scott: You're right.

542
00:35:51,226 --> 00:35:52,318
Scott: You're just gonna push this on me.

543
00:35:52,841 --> 00:35:55,633
Scott: Well, if you want to do all these all these months slash years.

544
00:35:55,674 --> 00:35:57,180
Scott: you haven't done anything and now you're gonna play.

545
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,368
Rym: I actually did edit together a bunch.

546
00:35:59,429 --> 00:36:00,432
Rym: I pulled all the clips out.

547
00:36:00,452 --> 00:36:02,400
Rym: I wanted to talk about for the next episode of utenna.

548
00:36:03,846 --> 00:36:04,653
Scott: I do actually have that.

549
00:36:04,694 --> 00:36:13,055
Rym: four years ago I did that actually a bit before PAX East and I thought oh after PAX East then things calm down and I can work on Stuff and then the world got weird.

550
00:36:15,167 --> 00:36:15,476
Rym: We'll see.

551
00:36:16,863 --> 00:36:23,640
Scott: You could in the time it takes to wait for us to do this You could just watch your tennis several times and then nothing we could possibly tell you would be new information.

552
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:26,559
Scott: You would have learned everything that we would tell you.

553
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:36,252
Rym: What's sad is all those videos keep getting comments and like people keep finding them and like they get to the last one And that episode that one has mostly comments saying oh, where's the next one?

554
00:36:36,573 --> 00:36:37,255
Rym: Did they die?

555
00:36:37,596 --> 00:36:38,720
Rym: What happened to those two guys?

556
00:36:39,961 --> 00:36:41,875
Scott: Even though there's a whole YouTube channel full of content.

557
00:36:41,895 --> 00:36:42,540
Scott: What happened to those?

558
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:47,200
Rym: Oh, the the people who watch the utenna videos tend to not be subscribers to the rest of our stuff.

559
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,264
Rym: They're like a sense.

560
00:36:48,304 --> 00:36:55,446
Scott: I can see that but usually on YouTube like I'll click on you know, the channel Underneath the video to see what helps that.

561
00:36:55,487 --> 00:37:01,900
Rym: now a subset of them are watching these streams and they actually ask this question a lot In the stream, this is the first time someone paid money to ask the question.

562
00:37:03,901 --> 00:37:06,712
Scott: Dude, take your five dollars and do something.

563
00:37:06,732 --> 00:37:07,133

Scott: You are eligible to vote in the United States of America and you do not successfully vote for Joe Biden go fuck yourself.

588
00:38:09,601 --> 00:38:15,813
Rym: We uh, uh, if you haven't read the GeekNights terms of service Which we're still evolving like we're trying to work on that more.

589
00:38:15,833 --> 00:38:19,279
Rym: I got I got some more changes I want to put into the get repo but anyway

590
00:38:19,962 --> 00:38:20,163
Scott: It is

591
00:38:20,283 --> 00:38:27,409
Rym: actually against our terms of service to be a member of the American Republican Party and interact with us on social media Like I'm not joking because we consider it a here.

592
00:38:27,912 --> 00:38:29,740
Rym: So yeah, but for Joe Biden.

593
00:38:31,081 --> 00:38:36,880
Rym: We can fix the problems that Joe Biden will cause a lot more easily if he's the person we're fighting.

594
00:38:37,862 --> 00:38:38,666
Rym: Think of it that way.

595
00:38:39,007 --> 00:38:40,233
Scott: He's kind of a pushover, right?

596
00:38:40,434 --> 00:38:43,525
Rym: Yeah, also Just platforms pretty good.

597
00:38:43,545 --> 00:38:46,254
Rym: He actually adopted a lot of Bernie's stuff and a lot of Warren's stuff.

598
00:38:46,395 --> 00:38:49,924
Scott: It's it's better than Literally kill everybody.

599
00:38:49,944 --> 00:38:51,469
Scott: Yeah, kill everybody.

600
00:38:51,509 --> 00:38:54,859
Scott: the platform if you care about other human beings.

601
00:38:54,959 --> 00:38:58,940
Scott: Yep But black don't care about other human beings go fuck yourself.

602
00:39:00,763 --> 00:39:01,106
Rym: All right.

603
00:39:01,871 --> 00:39:03,079
Rym: Star Wars squadrons.

604
00:39:04,421 --> 00:39:06,247
Rym: This game pretty good like spoilers.

605
00:39:06,929 --> 00:39:10,299
Rym: It's worth 40 bucks like actually it's only 40 bucks.

606
00:39:10,319 --> 00:39:11,703
Scott: surprised That it's 40 bucks.

607
00:39:11,703 --> 00:39:16,579
Scott: 40 bucks with no microtransactions and no DLCs so far.

608
00:39:17,343 --> 00:39:22,536
Rym: Yep, everything you can possibly unlock in this game is entirely Inside of the game like that's it.

609
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:23,763
Scott: Just play the game.

610
00:39:23,803 --> 00:39:24,626
Scott: so get stuff.

611
00:39:24,726 --> 00:39:30,567
Scott: everything that they said on paper coming up to the leading up to this game Despite it being an EA published game.

612
00:39:30,627 --> 00:39:32,654
Scott: It was made by motive in Canada.

613
00:39:32,694 --> 00:39:33,938
Scott: I think right I knew some.

614
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:39,013
Scott: I Tangentially am acquainted with some of the people that worked on it.

615
00:39:39,134 --> 00:39:43,839
Scott: kinda I think you know at least one Former GeekNights listener worked on this game.

616
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:52,275
Rym: It's fun when I notice a game that comes out and like some of the people who made it or tweeting and the people I follow Cuz they're games people and every now and then it's like oh that person follows me - oh wait.

617
00:39:52,315 --> 00:40:09,826
Scott: Oh, yeah, I know who that is But anyway so it is the spirit not spiritual actual successor to X-wing TIE fighter And X-wing Alliance which came out 20 years ago.

618
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:14,034
Scott: So 20 years after X-wing Alliance we get Star Wars squad.

619
00:40:14,194 --> 00:40:21,118
Rym: all we need is the Pokemon MMO to come out and Scott and I are in fact the profits of this era Of game design, that's right.

620
00:40:21,158 --> 00:40:29,477
Scott: So this game is a game in which you fly inside one of eight Star Wars star fighting ships.

621
00:40:29,678 --> 00:40:36,163
Scott: for you know, either it's you get X-wing you got your a-wing You got a Y-wing and you got this weird support thing.

622
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:37,066
Scott: I don't know the hell that is.

623
00:40:37,086 --> 00:40:45,739
Scott: Yeah the you wing Doing it or I never heard of a you wing anyway, and then the Empire side you got your tie fighter You got your tie interceptor my boy.

624
00:40:45,759 --> 00:40:50,181
Scott: You got your tie bomba and You got this other this fucking.

625
00:40:50,202 --> 00:40:51,088
Scott: I don't know what the hell it is.

626
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:54,239
Rym: Yeah No, they don't have a b-wing cuz that would be opie.

627
00:40:54,259 --> 00:40:57,067
Rym: There's no tie defender you nerds like that.

628
00:40:57,107 --> 00:40:57,609
Rym: Let that go.

629
00:40:59,813 --> 00:41:02,977
Scott: Yeah, it's fighter interceptor bomber and Weird thing.

630
00:41:03,158 --> 00:41:04,366
Rym: So here's the deal with the game.

631
00:41:04,447 --> 00:41:10,750
Rym: first off It has a single-player campaign that is like five to ten hours worth of content.

632
00:41:10,931 --> 00:41:12,676
Rym: Like it's not I played the entire thing.

633
00:41:12,696 --> 00:41:14,662
Scott: It is a single-player campaign.

634
00:41:14,682 --> 00:41:15,284
Scott: It has a plot.

635
00:41:15,364 --> 00:41:16,227
Scott: It has characters.

636
00:41:16,287 --> 00:41:17,370
Scott: It's mildly interesting.

637
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:19,199
Scott: Yeah, it's not too shabby.

638
00:41:19,259 --> 00:41:21,128
Rym: the missions are pretty fun, right?

639
00:41:21,188 --> 00:41:21,550
Scott: Some of it.

640
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:22,654
Scott: It's some of its fun.

641
00:41:22,694 --> 00:41:23,859
Scott: Some of its frustrating.

642
00:41:23,899 --> 00:41:34,290
Scott: you can sort of tell that the purpose of it is really Training to teach you to play this game by introducing things, you know mission by mission, you know to get you up to speed.

643
00:41:34,773 --> 00:41:37,288
Scott: You know, it's it's a long tutorial in disguise.

644
00:41:37,389 --> 00:41:45,892
Rym: Yeah This is not like tie fighter where you literally have like dozens and dozens and dozens of missions and branching nonsense and secret objectives Like.

645
00:41:45,912 --> 00:41:46,794
Rym: it's not a campaign.

646
00:41:47,376 --> 00:41:48,038
Scott: No, it's it's.

647
00:41:48,399 --> 00:41:50,787
Scott: you know, not that it's less than 20 missions.

648
00:41:50,807 --> 00:41:52,392
Scott: Maybe even less than 15.

649
00:41:52,392 --> 00:41:56,110
Scott: It's the same missions no matter what you play both light side and dark side.

650
00:41:56,170 --> 00:42:11,079
Scott: You have two characters actually some missions your one character on the light side and someone sometimes you're an imperial character doing the other side You know, it flips back and forth mission to mission as you go forward And you see that you see what one character is doing.

651
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:16,050
Scott: you see what the other set of characters are doing how they interact with Each other, you know, it's worth a playthrough.

652
00:42:16,991 --> 00:42:17,735
Scott: But is it worth $40?

653
00:42:17,735 --> 00:42:21,914
Scott: I don't know about that, right if that's all you want to do I don't know.

654
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:23,058
Scott: $40 is too much.

655
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:31,947
Scott: wait for the price to go down to at least 20 because that's basically One day of entertainment and I figure a movie can cost up to $20, you know sometimes.

656
00:42:32,047 --> 00:42:33,532
Scott: so that's a good Deal.

657
00:42:33,552 --> 00:42:40,210
Scott: if you've paid 20 bucks and just play this game in a day Yep, live a Star Wars movie like fight for five to ten hours.

658
00:42:40,311 --> 00:42:44,276
Rym: Maybe play through a couple times put it on a higher difficulty But then you'll run out of steam.

659
00:42:44,296 --> 00:42:50,890
Rym: this game is really aimed at if you want to do multiplayer Which frankly was my literal dream from the moment?

660
00:42:50,990 --> 00:43:04,203
Rym: I first played that x-wing game with my flight stick when I was a kid until today when I can finally realize it and in terms of that They got it like 90% right already.

661
00:43:04,484 --> 00:43:10,602
Rym: and most of the complaints I have are Bug fixes primarily and they fixed a lot of them.

662
00:43:10,783 --> 00:43:14,231
Rym: Yeah, they're fixing bugs like at a steady clip already Hmm.

663
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:23,721
Scott: So yeah, so this is a game where I think that the story of the game is that you know in the grand scheme When you zoom out, it's kind of perfect.

664
00:43:23,982 --> 00:43:30,505
Scott: right when you zoom in a little bit more It's like, you know, okay, they got all the fundamentals exactly, right?

665
00:43:30,967 --> 00:43:31,850
Scott: It's a Star Wars game.

666
00:43:32,533 --> 00:43:34,602
Scott: You can play in VR even.

667
00:43:34,642 --> 00:43:36,450
Scott: Yeah, it's like you're in the ship.

668
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:40,320
Scott: You have all the controls the complexity of the game.

669
00:43:40,541 --> 00:43:49,308
Scott: It's it's more complex than an arcade, you know situation But it's less complex than like a true flight sim, which is exactly in the exact right spot.

670
00:43:49,348 --> 00:43:51,296
Rym: You want it to be Yep, and don't worry in this review.

671
00:43:51,316 --> 00:43:54,450
Rym: We're gonna get into some details of what we mean by that specific state.

672
00:43:54,571 --> 00:43:59,743
Scott: It is a skill based Right multiplayer free space shooting game.

673
00:43:59,763 --> 00:44:01,650
Scott: It is not a game where you pay to win.

674
00:44:01,791 --> 00:44:03,724
Scott: It is not a game where you grind to win.

675
00:44:03,744 --> 00:44:04,530
Scott: It's nothing like that.

676
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:11,650
Scott: It's literally a skill based, you know high skill cap game meaning if someone's good, they will just fucking destroy you.

677
00:44:12,473 --> 00:44:13,036
Scott: That's right.

678
00:44:13,177 --> 00:44:14,584
Rym: Exactly, which is happening to us.

679
00:44:14,624 --> 00:44:17,580
Rym: We are our squad Not the finest.

680
00:44:18,305 --> 00:44:18,850
Scott: No, it's not.

681
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:22,540
Scott: So those fundamentals are all there.

682
00:44:22,621 --> 00:44:23,363
Scott: they're all in place.

683
00:44:23,383 --> 00:44:25,290
Scott: you pay for the game once you can play it forever.

684
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:26,795
Scott: There's no subscription.

685
00:44:26,855 --> 00:44:27,858
Scott: There's no nothing right.

686
00:44:28,681 --> 00:44:31,330
Scott: what they got wrong is the game.

687
00:44:31,831 --> 00:44:33,758
Scott: It feels like what they did.

688
00:44:33,778 --> 00:44:37,390
Scott: is they had like a checklist of things like we need to do all these things to release?

689
00:44:38,172 --> 00:44:39,376
Scott: And they did all those things.

690
00:44:39,416 --> 00:44:49,097
Scott: they completed the list 100% and then they released and they did not Spend the extra six months of polishing it until there wasn't a single scratch.

691
00:44:49,198 --> 00:44:50,361
Scott: and there's lots and lots.

692
00:44:50,501 --> 00:44:58,150
Scott: not lots and lots but a nice handful of Tiny niggly bits and rough edges that are not polished away.

693
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:12,910
Scott: Some of them were major bugs that have been fixed but there are still you know rough edges because it feels like they finished it and pushed it out rather than Really making it super awesome, which is probably why it's able to be $40 and not who knows how much.

694
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:22,675
Rym: now The cool thing is all all the polish issues are Things that are easily fixed and seem like they're being fixed mostly as bugs or minor improvements post release.

695
00:45:22,735 --> 00:45:31,050
Rym: quite a few have been fixed in and I think a lot of the rest of them will too and I would Say that the majority of the problems are in the tutorials and the menus.

696
00:45:31,991 --> 00:45:32,935
Scott: Yes, for sure.

697
00:45:33,577 --> 00:45:40,589
Scott: Also, you know despite the fact that it's a good thing There's no DLCs or microtransactions or any other kind of bullshit like that.

698
00:45:42,231 --> 00:45:48,610
Scott: It is somewhat of a negative in that it doesn't look like there's ever going to be more content for this game.

699
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:55,037
Rym: This is the whole game the end which so I'm good with because all I want is to get good at The skill of the game.

700
00:45:55,078 --> 00:45:56,304
Rym: like I don't want more shit here.

701
00:45:56,385 --> 00:45:57,310
Rym: I don't want more characters.

702
00:45:57,811 --> 00:46:04,490
Rym: I just want I'd be okay if at some point they added like more types of competitive formats.

703
00:46:05,371 --> 00:46:07,159
Scott: Yes, it's it's good and bad right?

704
00:46:07,239 --> 00:46:07,982
Scott: It's good in that.

705
00:46:08,023 --> 00:46:08,726
Scott: This is the game.

706
00:46:08,806 --> 00:46:09,690
Scott: get good at it, right?

707
00:46:09,791 --> 00:46:10,294
Scott: We would just taught.

708
00:46:10,335 --> 00:46:12,269
Scott: we spent a whole bunch of the show just now talking about it.

709
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:13,537
Rym: You don't want to get good at it.

710
00:46:13,558 --> 00:46:15,510
Scott: There's no expansions for chess, right?

711
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:25,750
Scott: But if you're the kind of person who seeks novelty, right and you're not in it for Deep, you know going deep on the game that exists and getting really good at it.

712
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:26,393
Scott: You just want to.

713
00:46:26,514 --> 00:46:27,459
Scott: you know, you will.

714
00:46:27,539 --> 00:46:32,150
Scott: you will even if you play multiplayer Probably get tired of this game.

715
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:37,150
Scott: Once you've played and all the ships and all the formats and all the maps and there's like there's nothing more for me.

716
00:46:37,371 --> 00:46:44,675
Scott: You if you're the kind of person who wants like Smash Brothers where there's more maps more characters more more more This game is not for you.

717
00:46:44,775 --> 00:46:45,838
Scott: It will run out on you.

718
00:46:45,858 --> 00:46:54,764
Scott: Yeah, but only way you can get more replay out of this game is personal skill development like a fighting game that doesn't have too many characters to choose from.

719
00:46:54,904 --> 00:46:56,530
Rym: and the thing is that is something that.

720
00:46:57,130 --> 00:47:01,650
Rym: That's what I personally seek out of games, but that is not what most people seek out of games.

721
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:04,300
Rym: So you really need to understand and think about this.

722
00:47:04,742 --> 00:47:06,990
Rym: if you are you the kind of person who plays Counter-Strike?

723
00:47:07,294 --> 00:47:13,309
Rym: Gets mad that you're ranked load Everyone's better than you and then go and play overwatch and then get mad because everyone's better than you.

724
00:47:13,753 --> 00:47:15,348
Rym: Guess what's gonna happen in this game?

725
00:47:16,331 --> 00:47:23,010
Scott: Also, are you the kind of person who's maybe good at Counter-Strike and you play dust and then you play Italy and I don't even Know what maps they have these days?

726
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:31,790
Scott: right and then you get around and you're back on dust again, and then you're on dust - and you're like dust again.

727
00:47:32,512 --> 00:47:37,570
Scott: Right, you're not interested in playing dust for the hundredth time because you feel like it's so boring.

728
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:38,715
Scott: You've done it a hundred times.

729
00:47:38,735 --> 00:47:43,796
Scott: Yeah versus someone who's like, I don't care what map it is I will become the master of.

730
00:47:43,816 --> 00:47:46,026
Scott: you know, I need to play dust a hundred more times.

731
00:47:46,086 --> 00:47:47,873
Scott: to these things about it I haven't perfected.

732
00:47:47,893 --> 00:47:52,210
Rym: I mean, I would go to servers that were just dust only because I wanted to just play dust.

733
00:47:52,991 --> 00:47:53,673
Scott: Right, exactly.

734
00:47:53,713 --> 00:48:04,366
Scott: So if you get bored by the same content over and over regardless of your skill advancement, you're gonna get bored By this game because it's only a handful of maps and eight ships.

735
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:12,530
Scott: Yep I've customized the ships a little bit But it seems like that some of the customizations are just better and there's not a lot of choice going on there though.

736
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:18,830
Rym: Part of that is the relatively small player base and the lack of matchmaking data is skewing that like.

737
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:23,806
Rym: But I think there will be some minor balance tweaks as the game goes on and I think also these.

738
00:48:23,886 --> 00:48:29,390
Scott: so it doesn't appear that There's actually An organized competitive scene yet.

739
00:48:29,834 --> 00:48:34,320
Scott: so there's sort of a lack of a Universal meta or at least a visible one.

740
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,865
Scott: that like you can you right you?

741
00:48:35,945 --> 00:48:37,048
Scott: I guess we had to join some.

742
00:48:37,069 --> 00:48:39,725
Scott: maybe I can go Find like a subreddit for this game and see what people are saying.

743
00:48:39,766 --> 00:48:46,467
Rym: Yeah The other thing I'd say is the community seems pretty good and chill like we were playing a match the other day.

744
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:48,956
Rym: mostly mostly We're we're the jerk like.

745
00:48:49,357 --> 00:48:52,370
Rym: I hate when people do this in overwatch and I hate that I'm doing it in this game.

746
00:48:52,752 --> 00:48:59,474
Rym: I was only doing it in this game because the in-game voice wasn't working great when it first came out but I Hated an overwatch.

747
00:48:59,514 --> 00:49:05,259
Rym: when I join a game and there's a group of people who are on my rando team But they're doing their own voice in discord.

748
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:10,970
Rym: So I can't talk to them or hear them because this game Absolutely requires you to coordinate with your teammates.

749
00:49:11,211 --> 00:49:18,490
Rym: You literally have to be like calling for fire support and like calling out targets and constantly communicating or you're just gonna get crushed.

750
00:49:19,156 --> 00:49:23,379
Scott: Yeah, I kind of wish that Like I have turned off the voice chat.

751
00:49:23,399 --> 00:49:25,970
Scott: just cuz I don't want to hear anyone yelling awful stuff, right?

752
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:42,790
Scott: But I do wish I could turn it on because I'm hoping maybe you know, like when I played PUBG, you know There were times where I would play like the team PUBG where like throws you in with a team of four people randomly Right, and I would occasionally get in with a good group and they would teach me something.

753
00:49:43,211 --> 00:49:45,118
Rym: Oh, but this game to scojo.

754
00:49:45,218 --> 00:49:51,990
Rym: while we were playing he was both in our discord and in the team chat And oh we were getting wrecked like way more than usual.

755
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:54,790
Rym: Like we've been doing better that session and then we're just getting fucking destroyed.

756
00:49:54,870 --> 00:49:55,735
Rym: We couldn't figure out why.

757
00:49:56,177 --> 00:50:04,330
Rym: and then he explains to us that the other people on our team Actually explained to him the glitch that the other team was exploiting and why we were losing.

758
00:50:05,151 --> 00:50:07,828
Scott: Yep, there's that lack of polish yet again, right?

759
00:50:09,491 --> 00:50:12,490
Rym: But like in overwatch, I'm always in the voice chat with randos.

760
00:50:12,591 --> 00:50:14,709
Rym: I play with randos 90% of the time and you know what?

761
00:50:15,292 --> 00:50:19,170
Rym: Maybe one and every hundred games to someone say something even remotely.

762
00:50:19,993 --> 00:50:20,475
Scott: You know what?

763
00:50:20,515 --> 00:50:22,703
Scott: Next time we play let's just not use discord.

764
00:50:22,724 --> 00:50:23,848
Scott: Let's use the in-game channel.

765
00:50:23,868 --> 00:50:24,893
Scott: See what happens All right.

766
00:50:25,034 --> 00:50:27,250
Scott: Yeah, cuz let's talk about how the game actually works.

767
00:50:27,291 --> 00:50:28,430
Scott: So there's a dog fighting mode.

768
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:30,979
Scott: The dog fighting mode is literally just shoot other people.

769
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:33,930
Scott: see who gets them, you know kill the other people a lot great.

770
00:50:34,412 --> 00:50:36,140
Rym: And the cool thing is I play it a lot.

771
00:50:36,461 --> 00:50:38,530
Rym: The meta is all over the place.

772
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:44,050
Rym: Sometimes I join and like everyone's in interceptors, which you might expect like ooh the super fragile super fast.

773
00:50:44,811 --> 00:50:46,757
Scott: You're not trying to destroy capital ships.

774
00:50:46,838 --> 00:50:50,370
Scott: Why would you use a bomber in a in a shit in a fighter on fighter?

775
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:55,310
Scott: You know dogfight the interceptor and the a-wing should be like the only ones you should see out there, right?

776
00:50:56,236 --> 00:50:59,519
Scott: right But no people bring out the x-wing.

777
00:50:59,539 --> 00:51:00,785
Scott: they bring out the Thai bomber.

778
00:51:00,805 --> 00:51:03,172
Scott: They were you know, it's like And it's like.

779
00:51:03,192 --> 00:51:05,158
Scott: yeah, it's not necessarily a bad choice.

780
00:51:05,299 --> 00:51:08,810
Rym: Yeah, because the ships are pretty well balanced like they you they're.

781
00:51:08,810 --> 00:51:13,262
Scott: No one brings out the support ship though in the dogfight there some people do.

782
00:51:13,383 --> 00:51:25,939
Rym: I don't know if the support ships are necessary in The meta or if they only exist to give people who are not as good at the rest of the game something to do and engage With kind of like how Team Fortress 2 had the healer.

783
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:29,310
Rym: that really wasn't fun compared to overwatch where the healers.

784
00:51:29,390 --> 00:51:29,912
Scott: That's a problem.

785
00:51:29,932 --> 00:51:41,130
Scott: I think you can do a whole episode of V nights about how support roles in games like You know exist to give people like a non murderous task and also a lower skill cap task.

786
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:45,345
Rym: But that's the fact that we tie the non murderous and the lower skill cap together.

787
00:51:45,365 --> 00:51:47,354
Rym: I think is the problem I like.

788
00:51:47,374 --> 00:51:50,529
Scott: I think you just make they should make the support high skill, too.

789
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:52,154
Rym: Yeah, that's what overwatch does.

790
00:51:52,455 --> 00:52:05,453
Rym: a lot of games do that now like there are low skill attack characters and high skill support characters Like they've separated you can you have two separate sliders in every character on skill cap.

791
00:52:05,574 --> 00:52:08,585
Scott: aren't the low skill ones just worse than and for competitive play?

792
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:14,250
Scott: because the high skill ones Balance out the higher skill difficulty with more power and numbers to a degree.

793
00:52:14,391 --> 00:52:18,830
Rym: Yes in the top tiers of the meta the lower skill characters just don't get played.

794
00:52:19,051 --> 00:52:23,534
Rym: But there are very high skill cap characters in every type Right.

795
00:52:23,554 --> 00:52:41,924
Scott: So I think that that exact thing is also what happens with the cut the ship Customizations in Star Wars squadrons, you'll look at for example Like you're choosing which hole to put on your tie fighter Yeah, and one of them will be like well if you use this hole you can turn faster But you'll go slower or something like that and it's like alright, whatever.

796
00:52:42,044 --> 00:52:44,594
Scott: and then there'll be another one that I'd be like Oh, you know what?

797
00:52:44,996 --> 00:52:54,630
Scott: This one is just better but Piloting will be more difficult and it's like well I can Counterback that more difficult piloting with my skills by getting better.

798
00:52:55,051 --> 00:52:57,457
Scott: So this is just better than the other options.

799
00:52:58,019 --> 00:53:02,290
Scott: and so all of those are the options that trade numbers for numbers.

800
00:53:02,491 --> 00:53:02,711
Scott: Right.

801
00:53:03,052 --> 00:53:09,190
Scott: Oh shoots faster, but shoots less accurately does more damage, but shoots less often, right?

802
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:11,739
Scott: It's like the highest DPS one is the best one.

803
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:14,970
Scott: It doesn't matter that those trade-offs don't matter, right?

804
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:17,310
Rym: It's unless you're not perfectly skilled.

805
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:18,869
Scott: Sure, of course.

806
00:53:19,412 --> 00:53:32,205
Scott: But once the idea is that if you play enough your skills will balance out You know the the weapon or the the armor that's like yeah, okay It's you know, it does more damage, but it's hard to aim.

807
00:53:32,265 --> 00:53:33,470
Scott: Well, I can aim better.

808
00:53:33,692 --> 00:53:35,330
Scott: So that's just the best weapon, right?

809
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:45,029
Scott: And and I think in the end those are going to be the only Equipments that are used on all the ships are those ones that give just more numbers with the skill trade-off.

810
00:53:46,251 --> 00:53:50,790
Rym: Yeah, I'll just be better now if skill if at some point they did add more modes.

811
00:53:51,433 --> 00:53:54,710
Rym: Nothing else in the game like more scenarios for combat.

812
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:59,869
Rym: I think some of those options become more viable because of situational stuff.

813
00:54:00,713 --> 00:54:00,914
Scott: Yep.

814
00:54:00,955 --> 00:54:01,115
Scott: Yep.

815
00:54:01,156 --> 00:54:04,030
Rym: Yep, but the dogfighting mode super super fun.

816
00:54:04,693 --> 00:54:08,770
Rym: And if I have to give you any advice, I'm we're trying to follow this advice.

817
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:10,096
Rym: But the game's real hard.

818
00:54:10,136 --> 00:54:12,527
Rym: The skill cap is up in the stratosphere.

819
00:54:12,547 --> 00:54:14,854
Rym: It's up in space It's up by the stars.

820
00:54:15,316 --> 00:54:28,250
Rym: like I cannot do what I'm about to say, but learning the rudiments of Like World War 2 era dogfighting like the basic techniques of like how to shake a tail how to call out like attacks.

821
00:54:28,813 --> 00:54:31,930
Rym: That stuff actually works and can help you be good at this game.

822
00:54:32,251 --> 00:54:32,753
Scott: You literally.

823
00:54:32,793 --> 00:54:37,170
Scott: how do you know it works if you haven't been able to do it because I have played games with randos where they?

824
00:54:37,551 --> 00:54:38,154
Rym: Do call outs.

825
00:54:38,174 --> 00:54:38,999
Rym: they're not doing like that.

826
00:54:39,019 --> 00:54:52,123
Rym: schweebs that might just be too hard But what they are doing is like I got a tail and they ping the tail and someone on the team will acknowledge that ping And disrupt it to save them and they'll do this reliably and I've seen I

827
00:54:52,204 --> 00:54:59,599
Scott: don't even have the situational awareness to know We're like all my teammates are and like dude And I wanted to come help you.

828
00:54:59,619 --> 00:55:01,810
Scott: I would spend like a minute finding you.

829
00:55:02,071 --> 00:55:03,017
Scott: I then you're dead Scott.

830
00:55:03,077 --> 00:55:03,721
Rym: all you have to do.

831
00:55:03,841 --> 00:55:06,273
Rym: if I ping a target then You'll get.

832
00:55:06,313 --> 00:55:09,384
Rym: it'll give you an audio and a visual indication saying like Rym ping to target.

833
00:55:09,725 --> 00:55:13,930
Rym: if you acknowledge that ping It'll turn your targeting computer to point out whatever I pinged.

834
00:55:15,271 --> 00:55:16,555
Rym: You do not know how the game works.

835
00:55:16,756 --> 00:55:17,418
Rym: did you not like?

836
00:55:17,579 --> 00:55:18,963
Scott: I mean I could there.

837
00:55:19,043 --> 00:55:24,697
Scott: that was though actually the one thing in the whole The entire like story mode.

838
00:55:24,978 --> 00:55:27,889
Scott: there was one point because it's the story modes is tutorial right.

839
00:55:27,910 --> 00:55:32,024
Rym: yeah It makes you do everything one by one like it makes you do everything once.

840
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:34,934
Scott: the acknowledge ping is the one thing I never successfully did.

841
00:55:35,075 --> 00:55:35,837
Rym: oh you do all.

842
00:55:35,898 --> 00:55:39,310
Rym: you don't have to do anything except click whatever button you bound to acknowledge ping and whatever.

843
00:55:39,370 --> 00:55:49,469
Scott: I don't know what the fuck but I still know what the fuck button it is and I when I looked when I had that on the screen during the tutorial slash story I went to the settings to figure out what button it was and like.

844
00:55:49,489 --> 00:55:54,365
Scott: I Couldn't figure out which button it was and I pushed buttons, and I didn't it.

845
00:55:55,794 --> 00:55:56,056
Scott: Let me.

846
00:55:56,299 --> 00:56:06,630
Scott: it said I acknowledge the ping But I couldn't tell what I did to acknowledge it and I couldn't see on the screen the indicator of Anything that looked like a ping or an acknowledgement, and I still have never seen one.

847
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:08,324
Scott: So I didn't know what it looks like or sounds like.

848
00:56:08,405 --> 00:56:11,711
Rym: so that is it Aside but it's a an annoyance I had.

849
00:56:11,751 --> 00:56:17,870
Rym: the hardest part of this game was setting up my hot ass for it because there's a lot of things to bind.

850
00:56:18,593 --> 00:56:19,677
Rym: There are no defaults.

851
00:56:19,898 --> 00:56:22,489
Rym: if you have a real joystick like there's no default that makes sense.

852
00:56:22,993 --> 00:56:35,616
Rym: You'd really have to customize it to your specific joystick and Due to the nature of modern joysticks like my joystick combo here has like 48 buttons and That's too many buttons.

853
00:56:36,119 --> 00:56:39,180
Rym: Yeah, because I'm not using a lot of them because a lot of them I don't need for a game like this.

854
00:56:39,604 --> 00:56:43,261
Rym: I needed about 16 to bind everything that I.

855
00:56:43,281 --> 00:56:43,965
Scott: that's a good number.

856
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:50,686
Rym: Yeah, but Try when I'm playing the game the first time I tried to just dive into it and there's no default.

857
00:56:50,707 --> 00:56:51,550
Rym: so everything's just nonsense.

858
00:56:51,671 --> 00:56:55,617
Rym: It would be like hit button 27 on joystick to it.

859
00:56:55,637 --> 00:56:56,039
Rym: I'm just like.

860
00:56:56,059 --> 00:56:58,890
Scott: that's an example of the lack of polish, right?

861
00:56:59,090 --> 00:56:59,873
Scott: You know is that like?

862
00:57:00,093 --> 00:57:05,250
Rym: like a polish game would have come with a profile for every popular hot ass set up?

863
00:57:06,192 --> 00:57:09,110
Scott: Yeah, even with my gamepad which is actually the default set up.

864
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:13,550
Scott: So I'm playing with a gamepad and it is actually way better than I anticipated for real game pads.

865
00:57:13,691 --> 00:57:16,253
Rym: Like you can play this game fine If you can't get a joy.

866
00:57:16,273 --> 00:57:23,216
Scott: it has to be a modern gamepad that has two analog sticks for face buttons a d-pad start select And two L's and two R's.

867
00:57:23,779 --> 00:57:26,250
Scott: but if you have all that you are good to go with this game.

868
00:57:26,491 --> 00:57:30,463
Scott: Like I don't see myself buying a stick because I'm not playing this game enough.

869
00:57:30,704 --> 00:57:34,068
Scott: I'm playing or spending all that money and Giving up all that space.

870
00:57:35,271 --> 00:57:37,800
Scott: But gamepad is way better than I thought it was gonna be.

871
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:47,390
Scott: but even then it would be like hey press this button and I'd look down at my gamepad and be like It says to push X but I push X and it's not it.

872
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:51,789
Scott: It's actually Y or it's actually a or it's actually something else, right?

873
00:57:52,350 --> 00:57:57,810
Scott: So but I guess the moral if I was using an actual Xbox controller and not this SN 30 Pro Plus.

874
00:57:57,891 --> 00:58:01,540
Scott: I think it would have been absolutely correct But I'm not so.

875
00:58:01,762 --> 00:58:02,609
Rym: so this is a game.

876
00:58:02,891 --> 00:58:03,393
Rym: I guess what I'll.

877
00:58:03,493 --> 00:58:12,427
Rym: the important part of that is you have to approach the first time you boot this game The way you would have approached the first time you turned on a DOS game in the old days.

878
00:58:12,789 --> 00:58:16,343
Rym: meaning Yeah, you go to the menu before you do anything.

879
00:58:16,644 --> 00:58:18,170
Rym: You look at the control customization.

880
00:58:18,773 --> 00:58:22,770
Rym: You just go down the list like sitting in front of your keyboard joystick, whatever it is you're using.

881
00:58:23,691 --> 00:58:29,250
Rym: You make a guess at what everything that you could bind does and you bind it to something that feels like it makes sense.

882
00:58:29,692 --> 00:58:30,736
Rym: Then try to play the game.

883
00:58:31,077 --> 00:58:34,090
Rym: You'll run into like three-quarters of those were terrible decisions.

884
00:58:34,471 --> 00:58:37,221
Rym: Now you understand your remap everything again.

885
00:58:37,643 --> 00:58:42,038
Rym: after you go through this process like four times You'll have everything bound to something that makes sense.

886
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:43,664
Rym: Then you can play the game.

887
00:58:44,065 --> 00:58:46,935
Rym: You got no way around Yeah on the gamepad.

888
00:58:47,015 --> 00:58:48,962
Scott: I see no need to rebind anything.

889
00:58:49,002 --> 00:58:51,390
Scott: I'm just sticking with the defaults and they're perfectly great.

890
00:58:52,791 --> 00:58:53,133
Scott: It's just.

891
00:58:53,414 --> 00:58:57,790
Scott: I would still you have to go into the settings and figure out what the hell button they're actually talking about.

892
00:58:58,413 --> 00:58:59,437
Rym: Now the game does something good.

893
00:58:59,558 --> 00:59:04,795
Rym: it supports people who don't have a ton of buttons because a Lot of things can be bound to a combo.

894
00:59:04,995 --> 00:59:15,670
Rym: like you can bind ping and again ping and act to hit a button to ping Hold that button to act like you can do things like that or you can bind them to separate things.

895
00:59:16,051 --> 00:59:17,758
Rym: Binding them to separate things only makes sense.

896
00:59:17,778 --> 00:59:27,230
Rym: If you're using a big-ass joystick, like I have all these toggle switches So all my targeting computer stuff at the bottom of my throttle I'm like flicking switches to do all that stuff and it feels great.

897
00:59:27,631 --> 00:59:32,950
Rym: But if you don't have that you can overload buttons on your joypad to make sure you can do everything you need to do.

898
00:59:33,434 --> 00:59:38,376
Rym: That's actually a really good design decision But I think so.

899
00:59:38,396 --> 00:59:48,840
Scott: the main so the main mode right we talk about the dogfighting mode right the main mode of this game is his fleet battle and the fleet battle is They set up a map and on one end of the map.

900
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:49,944
Scott: Is this MC 45, you know?

901
00:59:51,930 --> 00:59:57,858
Scott: Alliance yeah, Mon Calamari crews are looking thing Yeah, and then the other end is a star destroyer normal one.

902
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:01,929
Scott: and then there are two sort of capital ships, right?

903
01:00:03,091 --> 01:00:08,750
Rym: You know frigates basically, yep to frigates or to uh to like other types of ships, right?

904
01:00:08,890 --> 01:00:13,657
Scott: And then each side has sort of like this mini Ship.

905
01:00:13,758 --> 01:00:13,979
Scott: right.

906
01:00:14,019 --> 01:00:20,470
Scott: in the case of the good guys It's the Corvette the very Corvette that you a very first ship you see in Star Wars.

907
01:00:20,570 --> 01:00:26,232
Rym: So one that you have to slay is on the one with the auto turrets that you fought with when you were playing tie fighter Exactly.

908
01:00:27,095 --> 01:00:31,610
Scott: And on the other side the the Empire has this Reaper ship, which is like a little mini star destroyer.

909
01:00:31,610 --> 01:00:33,329
Scott: It's like a triangle guy little triangle guy.

910
01:00:34,492 --> 01:00:35,600
Scott: And then everyone.

911
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:37,029
Rym: I think that's just the assault ship.

912
01:00:38,812 --> 01:00:39,577
Scott: It's a little triangle guy.

913
01:00:39,698 --> 01:00:40,443
Rym: that is a little triangle.

914
01:00:40,463 --> 01:00:40,644
Rym: Yeah.

915
01:00:41,208 --> 01:00:45,041
Scott: Yeah Anyway, everyone launches out of the capital ship and it takes a while.

916
01:00:45,061 --> 01:00:47,910
Scott: It's like fly out to the you know battlefield, right?

917
01:00:49,231 --> 01:00:53,946
Scott: And you start shooting stuff and if you destroy enemy stuff you get points.

918
01:00:54,186 --> 01:00:56,695
Scott: if you destroy an enemy human You'd get a lot of points.

919
01:00:56,735 --> 01:00:57,277
Scott: That's like a lot.

920
01:00:57,358 --> 01:00:57,940
Scott: It's big-time.

921
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:00,470
Rym: Yeah, there's also a bunch of a eyes flying around like just random.

922
01:01:01,611 --> 01:01:05,529
Scott: There's just like garbage tie fighters and x-wings just flying around randomly controlled by AI.

923
01:01:05,790 --> 01:01:09,270
Scott: They don't do much and you actually don't even notice them unless you seek them out.

924
01:01:09,792 --> 01:01:17,450
Rym: But if you shoot them you got a couple points like it's not nothing and they do come after you like they will actually like Attack you and if you're doing dumb stuff, they'll really attack you a little bit.

925
01:01:17,490 --> 01:01:23,910
Scott: Yeah, if you fly too far like if you fly out near the enemy frigates, they will just destroy you basically instantly.

926
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:29,450
Rym: It's sort of like an instant kill zone just like an old tie fighter like you get too close to like a rebel capital ship.

927
01:01:29,470 --> 01:01:31,010
Rym: You're just done unless you were right.

928
01:01:31,131 --> 01:01:34,778
Scott: It's like you could survive out there But really you shouldn't see you sort of there's.

929
01:01:34,938 --> 01:01:37,730
Scott: only so far you can go away from your capital ship.

930
01:01:37,770 --> 01:01:40,039
Scott: That's safe and you start scoring points.

931
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:48,590
Scott: the other team scores points and whoever scores more points you'll see at the top of the screen this is bar that goes back and forth and It'll give one team the advantage.

932
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:52,988
Scott: so if you have the advantage it will now be safer for you to go further out.

933
01:01:53,350 --> 01:01:56,064
Scott: and So now you can start attacking their capital ships to try to destroy.

934
01:01:56,104 --> 01:02:01,468
Rym: so it's a lot like nidhogg You start in the middle and you're trying to push all the way to the other side and destroy the enemies thing.

935
01:02:01,588 --> 01:02:08,590
Scott: your mood There's like this instant kill zone sort of DMZ line and you're by scoring points killing enemies blowing up ships.

936
01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:17,830
Scott: you're moving that line towards the enemy and when you get hit the line moves towards you and You eventually you destroy both their capital ships, right?

937
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:25,507
Scott: both of their frigates whatever and The line gets pushed all the way back to their capital ship and then you can start destroying that.

938
01:02:25,527 --> 01:02:25,969
Scott: you have to just.

939
01:02:25,989 --> 01:02:28,096
Scott: it has Individual systems to destroy right?

940
01:02:28,618 --> 01:02:30,665
Rym: It's like it's got less though.

941
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:38,090
Scott: Like it's not like in the old shields It's you know, it's a pain in the ass But you eventually you can take it out and when you take it out you win and that's that's how it works.

942
01:02:38,391 --> 01:02:43,990
Rym: So it's sort of a back-and-forth push but the damage you do to those ships is permanent.

943
01:02:44,432 --> 01:02:46,640
Scott: So yeah, the only thing that's not permanent.

944
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:48,125
Scott: Is that the Corvette and the Reaper?

945
01:02:48,165 --> 01:02:48,968
Scott: the smallest?

946
01:02:49,109 --> 01:02:49,390
Scott: non?

947
01:02:50,390 --> 01:02:51,073
Scott: It's the smallest.

948
01:02:51,173 --> 01:02:51,997
Rym: It's not the Reaper.

949
01:02:52,218 --> 01:02:52,981
Rym: You call it a Reaper.

950
01:02:53,021 --> 01:02:55,050
Rym: The Reaper is the support ship on the Empire side.

951
01:02:55,150 --> 01:02:55,472
Rym: Oh, what?

952
01:02:55,552 --> 01:02:56,877
Scott: Oh the Raider the Raider.

953
01:02:56,898 --> 01:02:58,323
Scott: Ah, it's very similar.

954
01:02:58,364 --> 01:03:02,070
Scott: They both in start and end with our Raider.

955
01:03:02,633 --> 01:03:05,008
Rym: Anyway, I don't play those support ships on either side at all.

956
01:03:05,611 --> 01:03:24,684
Scott: No me either but the the you can if you push your advantage your whichever side sort of is currently like on the attack will have it like if the if the rebels start attack pushing a Corvette will spawn out of nowhere and start attacking and you can sort of fly with it and defend it because it will do a lot of damage if you can keep it alive.

957
01:03:25,169 --> 01:03:28,749
Scott: and Meanwhile, if you are being attacked by the Corvette you want to take that thing out quick?

958
01:03:29,011 --> 01:03:35,619
Scott: Yeah, because that'll give you a lot of points and sort of flip the field and then the Raider will come out and you can Attack with the Raider.

959
01:03:35,639 --> 01:03:36,609
Rym: now think about this, too.

960
01:03:36,932 --> 01:03:45,895
Rym: You might all be like star fighters when the match starts But once you get on the offense, you might have like someone switch like flies back to the hangar switches to a y-wing Mm-hmm.

961
01:03:46,117 --> 01:03:47,667
Rym: Like you can switch ships is the equivalent.

962
01:03:47,929 --> 01:03:57,630
Scott: Yeah Yeah, if you fly back, so there if you're for if your frigates are still alive They have healing zones in them that you can go into to heal to get repaired on the battlefield.

963
01:03:57,731 --> 01:04:01,550
Scott: Yeah, and as long as you're not dead, you can always go back to your capital ship.

964
01:04:01,590 --> 01:04:10,661
Scott: You just can fly as fast as possible right into the hangar and it'll just suck you in perfectly every time And then you can spawn a brand new ship in perfect quality.

965
01:04:10,781 --> 01:04:12,768
Scott: Even if your capital ship is on the brink of death.

966
01:04:14,451 --> 01:04:16,983
Scott: Yeah, just come right out with a brand new thing good as new.

967
01:04:17,184 --> 01:04:28,663
Rym: generally like Killing the humans who are playing like dogfighting with the humans and taking them out is the general thing to be doing Except when you have specific objectives along the way, you just got to coordinate with your team.

968
01:04:29,465 --> 01:04:38,219
Rym: the experience itself Just feels like you're in a Star Wars movie like the actual fighting when you don't run into glitches and it's just working even if You're getting wrecked by the other team.

969
01:04:38,904 --> 01:04:42,859
Rym: It just feels Really really immersive and tight.

970
01:04:43,261 --> 01:04:43,483
Rym: like.

971
01:04:43,724 --> 01:04:44,830
Rym: the environments are really good.

972
01:04:44,870 --> 01:04:46,587
Rym: There's a bunch of different maps that this happens in.

973
01:04:46,628 --> 01:04:48,550
Scott: the only Boring one of the maps is not so good.

974
01:04:48,570 --> 01:04:57,870
Rym: The boring one is the red mist one because it's just a big open field with some mist you can theoretically fly into But at the top and bottom, yeah, but the other ones like there's a big space station.

975
01:04:57,930 --> 01:04:59,761
Rym: You can actually get inside the space station.

976
01:05:00,002 --> 01:05:02,354
Scott: The space station was the best one I love.

977
01:05:02,655 --> 01:05:06,710
Rym: I was chasing a y-wing and he like went into the space station trying to get away from me.

978
01:05:07,171 --> 01:05:13,170
Rym: So I just flew to the other side of the space station and came around and like headed him off and it felt so good.

979
01:05:13,933 --> 01:05:15,039
Rym: We lost cuz we suck.

980
01:05:15,099 --> 01:05:17,130
Rym: but that one moment was so sublime.

981
01:05:17,391 --> 01:05:18,979
Rym: I don't think he expected the only thing about.

982
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:24,520
Scott: the only thing about the game that doesn't feel Absolutely, perfect is the feeling of speed.

983
01:05:24,841 --> 01:05:27,369
Rym: You're the only person I've ever heard complain about this.

984
01:05:28,054 --> 01:05:28,821
Scott: No one else has a problem.

985
01:05:28,901 --> 01:05:29,849
Scott: I've been complaining about it.

986
01:05:30,231 --> 01:05:32,078
Scott: So what happens is you're.

987
01:05:32,339 --> 01:05:35,570
Scott: you can be even in like an a-wing right with the fastest engine.

988
01:05:35,771 --> 01:05:40,268
Scott: You turn it up to full speed and you don't feel like you're going that fast.

989
01:05:40,288 --> 01:05:40,730
Rym: Yeah, I do.

990
01:05:40,951 --> 01:05:44,690
Scott: I don't know where you get there so far away at least at the start.

991
01:05:44,710 --> 01:05:46,450
Scott: Let's say you spawn out of your capital ship.

992
01:05:46,530 --> 01:05:49,002
Scott: You are so far away from the action that it like.

993
01:05:49,042 --> 01:05:50,750
Scott: it takes you just forever to get over there.

994
01:05:50,871 --> 01:05:52,430
Scott: It feels like forever, right?

995
01:05:53,570 --> 01:05:58,430
Scott: So it's like it's sort of like going beep beep beep, but then see you are actually going fast.

996
01:05:58,651 --> 01:06:01,950
Scott: It's just that the distance is so great and you're in wide open space.

997
01:06:02,091 --> 01:06:05,002
Scott: It wasn't feeling fast as soon as you get near things.

998
01:06:05,484 --> 01:06:06,770
Scott: It feels way too fast.

999
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:14,879
Scott: It's like this exponential thing right where it's like you'll be a thousand whatever units of distance They're using to you know to measure in this game.

1000
01:06:14,899 --> 01:06:17,829
Scott: Yeah, it tells you your range to your current target, right?

1001
01:06:18,211 --> 01:06:24,110
Scott: So be targeting so another an enemy TIE fighter and I'd be like, oh the enemy TIE fighters 1500 something's away from you.

1002
01:06:24,591 --> 01:06:26,537
Scott: And you're like, okay, you start flying towards it.

1003
01:06:26,577 --> 01:06:28,142
Scott: It'll be like 15 14 13 10 9 8 7 6 or 3 year.

1004
01:06:30,991 --> 01:06:32,196
Scott: It's exponential right?

1005
01:06:32,558 --> 01:06:34,245
Scott: So and that's what the speed feels like.

1006
01:06:34,305 --> 01:06:43,417
Scott: It's like when you're far away It feels like well I guess I'm gonna spend the next minute of this game getting back into the action and then once you're in the action It's like too fast too fast too fast.

1007
01:06:43,437 --> 01:06:44,500
Scott: Like you're going past the.

1008
01:06:44,761 --> 01:06:52,630
Rym: I wonder part of our difference, right in Perception might be specifically because I am playing in VR.

1009
01:06:53,535 --> 01:06:56,410
Scott: It could be the VR could definitely because modify the process.

1010
01:06:56,430 --> 01:07:14,256
Rym: I wasn't played in VR, but I'll talk about the VR a little bit because a brilliant thing about this game is VR headset for the cockpit of a vehicle in space is like the ideal use case for a VR headset and much Star Wars by supporting that.

1011
01:07:14,316 --> 01:07:21,820
Rym: the fact that the game works equally well on a desktop with a monitor or a VR headset and it supports pretty much any modern VR headset.

1012
01:07:22,502 --> 01:07:24,910
Rym: the fact that both are supported equally is great.

1013
01:07:26,011 --> 01:07:29,522
Rym: The caveat is they do not let you ever have a third-person view.

1014
01:07:29,542 --> 01:07:31,006
Rym: You are always first-person view.

1015
01:07:31,347 --> 01:07:32,170
Rym: that is by design.

1016
01:07:32,270 --> 01:07:36,404
Rym: They've talked a lot about why they made that have third-person view even without VR.

1017
01:07:36,425 --> 01:07:38,030
Scott: It's just yeah, there's only one camera.

1018
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:42,090
Rym: That's it first person the end, but I will say the cockpit the VR.

1019
01:07:42,893 --> 01:07:54,609
Rym: the only part that doesn't just work are glitches early on that they've mostly fixed now or Configuring your shit because it's really hard to configure your shit in VR before you've configured your shit.

1020
01:07:54,991 --> 01:08:03,200
Rym: Bind all your stuff out of VR before you try VR the first time or you will not be able to even open the menu Because you can't even see your keyboard.

1021
01:08:03,682 --> 01:08:09,641
Rym: It's not like you can like use your mouse Mmm, so I bound everything before I went in.

1022
01:08:09,681 --> 01:08:15,483
Rym: but once you get VR working it is The best way I could describe it is intense.

1023
01:08:15,985 --> 01:08:19,562
Rym: It feels very Very real.

1024
01:08:19,582 --> 01:08:26,470
Rym: it is Terrifying to crash into something like in a way that like I wince like physically.

1025
01:08:26,671 --> 01:08:33,852
Rym: I react like I'm in a car that's about to crash but the moment when you're sitting it like the cockpit visibility of the x-wing is Nuts.

1026
01:08:34,073 --> 01:08:36,241
Rym: you turn around you see r2 like sitting behind you.

1027
01:08:36,261 --> 01:08:37,185
Rym: He's reacting to stuff.

1028
01:08:37,667 --> 01:08:47,990
Rym: Like when I'm flying into VR I'll literally like a like the enemy jukes to the left and I look left out my window and like Plan like kind of zoom around them and see them and come back around.

1029
01:08:48,774 --> 01:08:51,870
Rym: I would say that VR also makes you better at the game.

1030
01:08:52,291 --> 01:08:56,649
Rym: It is a better experience for competitive play and is a more immersive experience.

1031
01:08:56,971 --> 01:08:58,361
Rym: It is the best way.

1032
01:08:58,381 --> 01:08:59,850
Scott: the abilities just look right?

1033
01:08:59,870 --> 01:09:02,750
Scott: It's like I could technically look using like the right stick or something.

1034
01:09:02,850 --> 01:09:07,569
Scott: Yeah, right, but it's you know, I guess if you have enough if you have enough hot ass, you know, I guess.

1035
01:09:08,513 --> 01:09:15,090
Rym: Well, like my joy, my hot ass actually has a little Like gamepad stick that my thumb can just use on this.

1036
01:09:15,170 --> 01:09:19,370
Scott: I thought you could use that for looking around inside the cockpit and it didn't practice.

1037
01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:21,263
Rym: You're never gonna do that with a joystick.

1038
01:09:21,404 --> 01:09:30,084
Scott: that just feels weird But so but yeah, the VR gives you a greater field of view, which is a competitive advantage No doubt, but you can really.

1039
01:09:30,104 --> 01:09:32,876
Rym: if you're gonna play with VR You really need a hot ass.

1040
01:09:33,477 --> 01:09:39,759
Rym: you could possibly get away with a game like a joypad like a gamepad of some kind But I do have a sort of lose.

1041
01:09:39,819 --> 01:09:47,095
Scott: you could I mean the gamepad would be just fine even in VR But you would lose the immersive aspect Yeah, and the immersive aspect like.

1042
01:09:47,136 --> 01:09:50,868
Rym: I cannot stress enough how real and intense and good it is.

1043
01:09:52,991 --> 01:10:01,179
Rym: This gets into another thing that they did well in the old like x-wing tie fighter type games X-wings and tie fighters didn't really feel that different.

1044
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:04,149
Rym: like the game kind of felt the same no matter what ship you were flying in.

1045
01:10:04,750 --> 01:10:17,329
Rym: This like a tie fighters are felt like the Imperial ships are very very very different from the rebel ships like Completely different skills some different things to do feels different to fly every single ship.

1046
01:10:17,550 --> 01:10:18,093
Scott: You know all.

1047
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:21,150
Scott: there's only eight ships, but there are eight very different ships.

1048
01:10:21,170 --> 01:10:25,070
Scott: Yeah, it's like I feel like if they had included a tie defender or a b-wing.

1049
01:10:25,210 --> 01:10:27,357
Scott: It's like you know would they where?

1050
01:10:27,417 --> 01:10:28,239
Scott: what else could they do?

1051
01:10:28,259 --> 01:10:30,887
Scott: that would be feel that different like cuz.

1052
01:10:30,907 --> 01:10:31,830
Rym: they know the x-wing game.

1053
01:10:31,850 --> 01:10:33,230
Scott: It might be different strategically.

1054
01:10:33,491 --> 01:10:35,176
Scott: Yeah, wouldn't you know be different?

1055
01:10:35,557 --> 01:10:39,410
Rym: you know feeling like you play la wing it doesn't actually feel different from an x-wing in this game.

1056
01:10:39,853 --> 01:10:46,529
Rym: You're flying x-wing you feel like you're good like you got this game And then you try an a-wing and you'll immediately crash because holy fuck is it fast?

1057
01:10:47,318 --> 01:10:52,044
Rym: Yeah, it's too fast But the and the visibility is a big factor to like the x-wing.

1058
01:10:52,225 --> 01:10:53,690
Rym: the rebel ships in general have great.

1059
01:10:54,313 --> 01:10:55,701
Scott: You can see everything.

1060
01:10:55,782 --> 01:10:57,210
Scott: it's like you have a big glass dome.

1061
01:10:57,311 --> 01:11:00,572
Scott: You know see the whole world and you fly and then you fly a tie fighter And you're.

1062
01:11:00,693 --> 01:11:07,109
Rym: it's like you're looking at a peephole at the world and in VR It's funny because you look around and you see just like the inside of a tie fighter.

1063
01:11:08,238 --> 01:11:08,750
Rym: I'm like lead.

1064
01:11:08,870 --> 01:11:19,080
Rym: I literally am like leaning forward in my seat to try to look down between my legs when I'm chasing someone Mm-hmm, but also gameplay is very different.

1065
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:22,590
Rym: Here's a. I'll give one example that drives home how like.

1066
01:11:23,571 --> 01:11:33,150
Rym: Well, they designed the game itself irrespective of the polish problems Though a big aspect of the old games was you can divert power between shields and weapons and engines in this game.

1067
01:11:33,290 --> 01:11:38,208
Rym: But it was very fiddly like plus or minus a pip like you tune it constantly through the game.

1068
01:11:38,269 --> 01:11:47,078
Rym: in this You generally go between put it fucking all in engines or all in weapons or all in shield Yeah, and pips are still there, but it's like.

1069
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:53,458
Scott: do you really it does like, you know to sit there fiddling with the pips It's like no you're rather an engine mode shield mode.

1070
01:11:53,518 --> 01:11:59,832
Scott: If your ship has shields or weapon mode, but the three modes the difference is Radical.

1071
01:11:59,872 --> 01:12:02,602
Rym: if you put it in engines you're going like twice as fast.

1072
01:12:02,822 --> 01:12:06,640
Scott: you put it in and when you're in engines your boost will Start charging and you can use the boost.

1073
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:09,175
Rym: Yep, or you put it in weapons You just had like.

1074
01:12:09,196 --> 01:12:14,028
Rym: your lasers are just better and stronger and recharge You get near a capital ship or it's like you have to.

1075
01:12:14,089 --> 01:12:18,470
Scott: you know It's like you sort of have to like switch to weapons when you before you start shooting then switch away from it.

1076
01:12:18,530 --> 01:12:21,948
Scott: But if you switch to weapons when you're shooting someone fast They're getting might get away from you.

1077
01:12:22,331 --> 01:12:26,890
Scott: So you have to keep it in engines and then you're shooting them but you're shooting them weak sauce and hit them more.

1078
01:12:27,412 --> 01:12:34,046
Scott: You know, you gotta you gotta figure it out, but the Thai fighters don't have shields No shields, but instead they have a thing.

1079
01:12:34,086 --> 01:12:34,690
Rym: they can do that.

1080
01:12:34,770 --> 01:12:35,974
Rym: No, the rebel ships can't do.

1081
01:12:36,235 --> 01:12:40,970
Rym: you can still divert power between she or not between shield between weapons and engines.

1082
01:12:41,091 --> 01:12:41,958
Rym: That's the normal thing.

1083
01:12:41,978 --> 01:12:48,224
Rym: You can also Shunt power separately from the charging and no rebel ships can do this.

1084
01:12:48,464 --> 01:12:55,770
Rym: so you can just take your engine power and Transfer it into your weapons instantly like take all your boost and turn it in a laser or vice versa.

1085
01:12:56,712 --> 01:12:58,183
Rym: That is really like.

1086
01:12:58,344 --> 01:12:59,170
Rym: I'm not good at that.

1087
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:04,670
Rym: We mostly fly rebel and I'm still like trying to learn how to do that effectively in a Thai fighter.

1088
01:13:04,791 --> 01:13:08,810
Scott: I'm still not even entirely sure like the exact details of like how it works.

1089
01:13:09,252 --> 01:13:09,997
Rym: Real simple.

1090
01:13:10,077 --> 01:13:17,807
Rym: if you hit the button to shunt into weapon It takes all your boost away and puts up that equivalent amount of energy into laser.

1091
01:13:17,827 --> 01:13:24,077
Scott: charge instantly Okay with no loss Okay, but it does it like what happened does it?

1092
01:13:24,398 --> 01:13:27,327
Scott: but in future energy that I'm generating the charging is there.

1093
01:13:27,487 --> 01:13:29,764
Rym: the charging is independent of the shunting.

1094
01:13:30,692 --> 01:13:32,762
Rym: Okay, so if I tell it so charge.

1095
01:13:32,782 --> 01:13:38,450
Rym: so what I often do in a Thai fighter now I tell it I put it in engine mode all the time and anytime I need more lasers.

1096
01:13:38,631 --> 01:13:39,957
Rym: I don't tell it to charge lasers.

1097
01:13:40,298 --> 01:13:42,508
Rym: I just shut my boost into my lasers directly.

1098
01:13:44,015 --> 01:13:45,210
Scott: So I have to add way to do it.

1099
01:13:45,230 --> 01:13:53,130
Rym: So my left thumb is on a stick to change the engine charging like that Like what's charging and my right thumb on my hot ass is shunting power?

1100
01:13:54,831 --> 01:14:01,519
Scott: Mmm, so the shunting button the button that you use to shunt at least on a gamepad by default if you're in an x-wing That has shields.

1101
01:14:01,923 --> 01:14:05,661
Scott: that button Instead does shield directionality.

1102
01:14:05,862 --> 01:14:17,969
Scott: so you can put your shields forward or back or neutral When you're going in when you're going in like, you know on an attack run you put your shields forward Yeah, and then you shoot and then you turn around and you're running away.

1103
01:14:18,431 --> 01:14:22,910
Scott: Right because the big strategy of this game is that when you die the enemy team scores a lot of points.

1104
01:14:23,031 --> 01:14:24,139
Scott: Yeah, you don't want to die.

1105
01:14:24,583 --> 01:14:27,570
Rym: You can get back home Even if you're out of action for a while doing it.

1106
01:14:27,670 --> 01:14:28,433
Rym: It is so worth it.

1107
01:14:28,654 --> 01:14:31,344
Scott: more important than killing is not dying because you die.

1108
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:33,050
Scott: you give them points to give them the advantage.

1109
01:14:33,211 --> 01:14:35,962
Scott: So just go out there do any amount of damage.

1110
01:14:35,982 --> 01:14:39,880
Scott: you go back and heal instead of dying Even if you have one health left, that's actually good.

1111
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:42,010
Scott: If you have one health left, right you make it back and survive.

1112
01:14:42,612 --> 01:14:43,837
Scott: Right, that is great.

1113
01:14:43,937 --> 01:14:47,851
Scott: So you put the rear shields on and when you run away and you're all good Yep.

1114
01:14:48,112 --> 01:14:51,202
Rym: So what I've got those bound to is on my my joystick.

1115
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:53,410
Rym: My main one has one two, three four hats.

1116
01:14:53,932 --> 01:14:57,546
Rym: So one of those hats is for charging the engine stuff on my throttle.

1117
01:14:57,626 --> 01:14:58,590
Rym: I have three more hats.

1118
01:14:58,670 --> 01:15:04,665
Rym: so one of the hats on the throttle is for Redirecting the shields and the other hat is for shunting energy.

1119
01:15:04,986 --> 01:15:05,930
Rym: and the shunting energy.

1120
01:15:05,990 --> 01:15:09,309
Rym: I made those directions match the charging directions on the other hat.

1121
01:15:10,092 --> 01:15:21,170
Scott: yeah, the gamepad just the default controls are to have the shunting and the shield directions on the same button because They're this when you're in what a tie fighter you're never gonna have shield directions, right?

1122
01:15:21,290 --> 01:15:24,903
Scott: and so that's the same button for either way and it's the same user interface on the screen.

1123
01:15:25,285 --> 01:15:30,930
Scott: the only difference is that the Shunting is like left and right and the shields are up and down and there's more things like that.

1124
01:15:31,010 --> 01:15:39,504
Rym: but the the moral of that is pretty simply just that the ships are Very different from each other and require very different skills and have different.

1125
01:15:39,524 --> 01:15:41,270
Scott: you have to get good at all the ships, right?

1126
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:48,061
Scott: it's it's and it's not like say You know other asymmetric games you can specialize in one thing.

1127
01:15:48,121 --> 01:15:49,826
Scott: be like, I'm like I play guile.

1128
01:15:50,087 --> 01:15:51,290
Scott: I mean Samus.

1129
01:15:51,391 --> 01:15:51,915
Scott: It's like no.

1130
01:15:51,955 --> 01:15:55,614
Scott: No, you got to be good at all fucking eight of these ships Or like.

1131
01:15:55,634 --> 01:15:58,166
Rym: right now Julie I'm practicing hard with the a-wing.

1132
01:15:58,186 --> 01:16:00,950
Rym: I'm getting pretty good at it Like I am good at the a-wing and I did it.

1133
01:16:00,990 --> 01:16:04,890
Rym: I did a decent job in our last game of keeping people off of you guys like it was working out.

1134
01:16:05,578 --> 01:16:09,760
Rym: I got a lot of kills But I go play the interceptor the equiv the red.

1135
01:16:09,780 --> 01:16:12,007
Rym: the Imperial equivalent of the a-wing is the tie interceptor.

1136
01:16:12,047 --> 01:16:12,950
Rym: That's their interceptor.

1137
01:16:13,731 --> 01:16:16,898
Rym: I'm just a garbage baby at it, even though it's the interceptor.

1138
01:16:16,999 --> 01:16:21,089
Rym: It's so different from the a-wing that I can't fucking fly it.

1139
01:16:22,112 --> 01:16:24,743
Rym: Yep, that is what's making this game great.

1140
01:16:24,783 --> 01:16:25,727
Rym: that is where I'm finding.

1141
01:16:25,767 --> 01:16:30,730
Rym: a lot of the fun I'm having is just every decision you make in the game matters a lot.

1142
01:16:32,292 --> 01:16:40,990
Scott: So I think if you are who should buy this game if you have a VR headset Honestly, like just get this game because this is oh, yeah, cuz there's like what other game you're gonna get.

1143
01:16:41,170 --> 01:16:51,829
Rym: Yeah, no game if you're a VR like this game is just don't buy a VR headset or just for this game No, but if you already have a VR headset, this is a must-buy game.

1144
01:16:52,571 --> 01:16:59,430
Scott: Yeah, even if you just you're really tutorial if like us you really like the old tie fighters x-wings and whatnot.

1145
01:16:59,530 --> 01:17:00,656
Scott: Then you got to get this game.

1146
01:17:01,259 --> 01:17:06,823
Scott: if you're a Star Wars fan who is fast Fantasized about flying Star Wars ships.

1147
01:17:06,863 --> 01:17:07,728
Scott: Yeah get this game.

1148
01:17:09,213 --> 01:17:11,909
Scott: If you're so rich that $40 means nothing to you get this game.

1149
01:17:12,010 --> 01:17:21,790
Scott: Yeah, if you really like getting competitively good at a high skill game And you want to do a space shoot a game you can get this game.

1150
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:28,169
Scott: Yeah, if you want to do the single player of this game and not are interested in multiplayer I would wait for it to be cheap.

1151
01:17:28,230 --> 01:17:29,233
Scott: Yeah Then get this game.

1152
01:17:29,695 --> 01:17:41,795
Rym: if you get really salty when you don't get Rewarded by just playing like if you need like loot boxes and nonsense to keep you playing a game you do unlock some Skins and things.

1153
01:17:41,876 --> 01:17:45,510
Rym: Oh, yeah, but you don't get anything that helps you with the game.

1154
01:17:45,871 --> 01:17:51,110
Rym: Nothing progresses in a meaningful way unless you get better at flying.

1155
01:17:52,031 --> 01:17:52,654
Scott: That's it, right.

1156
01:17:52,694 --> 01:17:53,959
Scott: You can play this game for a year.

1157
01:17:54,060 --> 01:17:56,450
Scott: And if you don't get better at it, you'll still be ranked trash.

1158
01:17:56,673 --> 01:18:06,890
Rym: yep, if you Struggle with that in other games do not get this game because you're gonna this game Unlike a lot of other games that are high have high skill caps in competition.

1159
01:18:06,990 --> 01:18:10,708
Rym: This game basically gives you nothing if you are bad at it.

1160
01:18:11,554 --> 01:18:15,940
Scott: But yeah, if Star Wars and skill-based Competitive multiplayer are not for you.

1161
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:16,984
Scott: This game is not for you.

1162
01:18:17,104 --> 01:18:17,868
Scott: Do not get this game.

1163
01:18:17,908 --> 01:18:24,389
Rym: Yep This game will have a bad time If you hot asses and joysticks are just sold out and really hard to get it.

1164
01:18:25,252 --> 01:18:26,810
Rym: You do not need one to play this game.

1165
01:18:26,850 --> 01:18:29,982
Scott: Like Scott said the gamepad is way better than you.

1166
01:18:30,685 --> 01:18:33,535
Scott: like I figured gamepad was poop I was gonna do mouse and keyboard.

1167
01:18:33,655 --> 01:18:40,350
Scott: No gamepad, you know with two analog sticks a modern gamepad is Totally legit at this game way.

1168
01:18:40,491 --> 01:18:44,410
Scott: But they did a way good job of gamepad support because I think the game got console releases.

1169
01:18:44,510 --> 01:18:51,230
Scott: Yeah, so only played the PC version, but I assume the console ones are the same as the experience I'm having only on a television.

1170
01:18:51,654 --> 01:19:00,895
Rym: I recommend if You're serious about the game getting a full-on hot ass like hands-on throttle and stick Because it just may probably help at least a little bit But I don't think it helped.

1171
01:19:00,955 --> 01:19:06,802
Scott: I think the difference is less than I thought before playing Yeah, but it's obviously that it just from playing with the gamepad.

1172
01:19:06,842 --> 01:19:11,602
Scott: It's obvious the hot ass would be better Yeah, but I previously thought it would be a lot better.

1173
01:19:11,803 --> 01:19:16,037
Scott: and now I'm saying it's probably Moderately or maybe even just a little better.

1174
01:19:16,057 --> 01:19:19,489
Rym: I think it's a lot better at very high skill, but I am NOT that.

1175
01:19:20,552 --> 01:19:21,498
Scott: Yeah, well, I think they did.

1176
01:19:21,538 --> 01:19:22,343
Scott: there was recently.

1177
01:19:22,403 --> 01:19:26,475
Scott: that's an example of a bug fix They recently fixed like the dead zones on actual joysticks.

1178
01:19:26,655 --> 01:19:29,400
Rym: Oh, yeah, they basically made joysticks way worse than they fixed it.

1179
01:19:30,291 --> 01:19:31,715
Scott: But they fixed it now, so it's all good.

1180
01:19:32,237 --> 01:19:35,849
Rym: Uh, but the hot ass is definitely a lot more fun.

1181
01:19:37,193 --> 01:19:47,283
Rym: But yeah, but if you can't get a hold of one more immersive It's fun enough with a gamepad until you get your like pre your back order of a logitech thing I personally recommend the side tech or logitech.

1182
01:19:47,625 --> 01:19:51,059
Rym: I guess x56 Stick and throttle that one actually was.

1183
01:19:51,099 --> 01:19:51,863
Scott: I think there's two.

1184
01:19:51,903 --> 01:19:53,450
Scott: there's two logitech models.

1185
01:19:53,571 --> 01:19:57,010
Scott: I think that they currently make there's like a super high-end one and a super normal one.

1186
01:19:57,070 --> 01:19:58,556
Scott: I think the normal one's gonna get you there.

1187
01:19:58,616 --> 01:20:02,630
Scott: Yeah, because this is not a full you don't need the super fancy extra expensive.

1188
01:20:03,136 --> 01:20:04,350
Scott: Just get the regular expensive.

1189
01:20:04,451 --> 01:20:07,733
Rym: I only got the more expensive one because one it will.

1190
01:20:07,793 --> 01:20:13,665
Rym: I found a place I could buy it and the other the cheaper one was out of stock and I really wanted it as fast as possible.

1191
01:20:13,726 --> 01:20:19,590
Rym: and two I'm also planning to get deep into Microsoft flight simulator and I did need all those toggle switches for that.

1192
01:20:20,192 --> 01:20:25,809
Scott: If you're doing Microsoft flight simulator, then yeah, you're gonna want but you don't need foot pedals for this game.

1193
01:20:26,311 --> 01:20:27,796
Scott: Most no, they won't help you that much.

1194
01:20:27,977 --> 01:20:32,874
Scott: because yeah, so there is an X. there's an x56 hot ass 50. there's an x52 and an x52 professional.

1195
01:20:37,550 --> 01:20:38,473
Scott: The x56 is 250 dollars.

1196
01:20:38,493 --> 01:20:46,417
Scott: The 52 is 150 and the 52 Professional is 200.

1197
01:20:46,417 --> 01:20:48,706
Scott: You'll be fine with those 52s for this game.

1198
01:20:48,746 --> 01:20:49,730
Scott: They are gonna get you there.

1199
01:20:50,032 --> 01:20:52,590
Scott: They'll probably even get you there for Microsoft flight simulator.

1200
01:20:53,032 --> 01:20:56,707
Scott: but if you get really serious that yeah, you're gonna need that x56.

1201
01:20:56,828 --> 01:21:00,643
Scott: and also It seems like they make a lot of other stuff like this.

1202
01:21:00,783 --> 01:21:02,410
Scott: actually if you're doing flight simulator.

1203
01:21:02,450 --> 01:21:07,604
Rym: Oh, they make like you stop panels of switches and buttons that mirror real cockpits.

1204
01:21:08,005 --> 01:21:10,915
Scott: They've got flight instrument panels They got rudder pedals.

1205
01:21:10,995 --> 01:21:12,682
Scott: They got yokes, right?

1206
01:21:12,742 --> 01:21:13,847
Scott: They got all that kind of stuff.

1207
01:21:13,887 --> 01:21:19,030
Scott: They got you know The throttle quadrant that has the three separate things, you know on it, right?

1208
01:21:19,210 --> 01:21:21,900
Rym: Yep, I mean the x56 does have a dual throttle.

1209
01:21:22,322 --> 01:21:24,470
Rym: dual throttle does not do anything for you in Star Wars.

1210
01:21:25,132 --> 01:21:25,573
Scott: No, it doesn't.

1211
01:21:25,593 --> 01:21:30,730
Scott: the x52 is the one for Star Wars if this is your game, but oh, you know, it's on $50.

1212
01:21:30,730 --> 01:21:32,296
Scott: So are you playing $150?

1213
01:21:32,296 --> 01:21:35,828
Scott: You better really fucking love this game, which I think I do like.

1214
01:21:35,888 --> 01:21:46,650
Rym: it's real fun I guess the last thing I'll say is I'm glad that they definitely leaned into the yes This is the successor to those games because they added all these little touches.

1215
01:21:46,831 --> 01:21:49,370
Rym: Like you can go into the hangar and look at your ship.

1216
01:21:49,711 --> 01:21:53,770
Rym: There's a briefing in the game like they tell it like you get a briefing room in competitive.

1217
01:21:54,217 --> 01:21:55,030
Rym: There's a briefing room.

1218
01:21:55,090 --> 01:22:04,350
Rym: You can like sit with your team and plot before you fight The two stormtroopers that stand by the hangar in TIE fighter the whole time and don't let you in until you like register your name.

1219
01:22:04,692 --> 01:22:07,708
Rym: They're fucking standing there if you're playing in VR and you look behind you.

1220
01:22:08,851 --> 01:22:15,470
Rym: Yeah, all those little touches are there and I think all the polish issues are gonna get resolved within another three or four months.

1221
01:22:15,530 --> 01:22:16,958
Rym: They'll have resolved all those issues.

1222
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:19,108
Scott: We'll see how much they continue to work on.

1223
01:22:19,129 --> 01:22:29,019
Scott: the game Definitely feels like a game where they made it they released it and they're do they like cut down to a skeleton crew to like Barely get it through its release period

1224
01:22:29,039 --> 01:22:32,835
Rym: and I wonder if they pushed it to get it out early because of kovat and people Are stuck at home -

1225
01:22:33,156 --> 01:22:42,796
Scott: who knows they're either going to Real see big numbers on it and then put more people on it and try to expand it or they're gonna be like, okay Original plan.

1226
01:22:42,897 --> 01:22:44,204
Scott: right where this game is now.

1227
01:22:44,426 --> 01:22:45,130
Scott: it is what it is.

1228
01:22:45,230 --> 01:22:49,450
Scott: We'll keep these servers on for some period of years and then turn them off the end.

1229
01:22:49,771 --> 01:22:52,641
Rym: Yep, maybe re-release it or do something in the future.

1230
01:22:52,662 --> 01:22:59,483
Rym: Like there's a lot of things they could do but I Guess the last complaint I have now and this will hopefully also resolve itself.

1231
01:22:59,844 --> 01:23:01,250
Rym: The matchmaking is not great.

1232
01:23:01,391 --> 01:23:07,503
Rym: You will get matched against people who are Infinitely better than you and you're just gonna have to deal with.

1233
01:23:07,543 --> 01:23:10,115
Scott: yeah, they improved it, but it's still man You're.

1234
01:23:10,539 --> 01:23:16,630
Rym: the matchmaking is not great But we can always get together with some of you like our squad versus like a squad of the listener.

1235
01:23:18,252 --> 01:23:18,837
Rym: That could be fun.

1236
01:23:18,877 --> 01:23:19,260
Rym: Yeah, sure.

1237
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:27,352
Scott: I Did notice though that after they fixed so-called fixed the matchmaking what was happening is we kept getting matched against the same people over And over.

1238
01:23:27,432 --> 01:23:30,630
Scott: Yep, which is bad people are in your skill range play.

1239
01:23:30,851 --> 01:23:32,381
Scott: Oh, these people are still in your skill range.

1240
01:23:32,441 --> 01:23:33,890
Rym: play them again because there was one of them.

1241
01:23:33,930 --> 01:23:35,237
Rym: I won't say they're handling kids.

1242
01:23:35,257 --> 01:23:37,570
Rym: They're listening or like because there aren't that many people at that level.

1243
01:23:37,671 --> 01:23:39,544
Rym: Maybe they always flew the bombers.

1244
01:23:39,585 --> 01:23:40,249
Rym: They were kind of bad.

1245
01:23:40,715 --> 01:23:41,830
Rym: So I knew they were bad.

1246
01:23:41,910 --> 01:23:50,209
Rym: So every time I saw them I made a point of going out of my way to kill them because they were an easy kill And we kept playing games and they kept being against us.

1247
01:23:50,611 --> 01:23:57,789
Rym: So I kept like ragging on this one poor player for like two hours across games and I felt bad but kills the kill.

1248
01:23:59,431 --> 01:24:02,884
Scott: Well, it actually feels late but it's 730 because it's the shitty time of year.

1249
01:24:02,904 --> 01:24:03,707
Scott: God damn it.

1250
01:24:04,088 --> 01:24:06,358
Rym: GeekNights It's actually recorded at night.

1251
01:24:07,222 --> 01:24:08,970
Scott: Oh, no, it's recorded at night again for once.

1252
01:24:10,431 --> 01:24:11,702
Scott: I've talked enough about this game.

1253
01:24:11,763 --> 01:24:12,610
Scott: I don't use anything more.

1254
01:24:12,690 --> 01:24:15,910
Scott: You can really learn about it because it's not really that big a game, right?

1255
01:24:16,190 --> 01:24:21,170
Scott: It's its depth is in the gameplay not in you know, the stuff there's like so many maps.

1256
01:24:21,170 --> 01:24:25,042
Rym: There's a lot more that could be said but it's at the level of detail of.

1257
01:24:25,383 --> 01:24:29,416
Rym: let's talk about specific loadouts Let's talk about specific strategies.

1258
01:24:29,697 --> 01:24:30,560
Rym: That's not the kind of show.

1259
01:24:30,580 --> 01:24:33,729
Rym: GeekNights says go find some Star Wars squadrons podcast for that.

1260

Rym: Yeah, there we go.

1269
01:25:21,358 --> 01:25:25,353

Rym: All right, Alan Joyce, Heidi McNichol, Marty Greenia, Graham Finch.

1278
01:26:12,692 --> 01:26:15,570
Rym: If Scott doesn't want to do it, maybe I'll put out a preview video.

1279
01:26:15,710 --> 01:26:19,105
Rym: That's just my half of it, but I'll get something out for you in the next month or so.
