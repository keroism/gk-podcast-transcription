1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,351
Rym: It's Wednesday, February 5th, 2020.

2
00:00:12,351 --> 00:00:12,772
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,873 --> 00:00:13,334
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,414 --> 00:00:19,179
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight Weathering With You, a film by Makoto Shinkai.

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,958
Rym: Let's do this.

6
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:32,042
Rym: I just want to point out that, uh, you know in GeekNights we always have this thing at the beginning of the show where we just talk about something like, "I was

7
00:00:32,103 --> 00:00:32,786
Rym: bikin'!"

8
00:00:32,826 --> 00:00:33,429
Rym: or "I ate a good

9
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:33,892
Rym: food!"

10
00:00:33,932 --> 00:00:35,500
Rym: like whatever, like stuff, like the banter.

11
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:39,740
Scott: Usually, usually it's something that we sit down to do the show and someone just remembers.

12
00:00:40,302 --> 00:00:42,612
Scott: We try to remember something recent or from the day.

13
00:00:42,713 --> 00:00:44,159
Rym: Like, "Did anything happen to

14
00:00:44,199 --> 00:00:44,360
Rym: me?".

15
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:48,212
Scott: But sometimes something happens and you're like, "That was a thing.

16
00:00:48,272 --> 00:00:48,935
Scott: I can't forget.

17
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:50,400
Scott: the next GeekNights is far away.

18
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:55,456
Scott: I must tell the other person or perhaps digitally record to remember because remember the

19
00:00:55,476 --> 00:00:55,757
Scott: thing.".

20
00:00:55,877 --> 00:00:56,700
Rym: We are like fish.

21
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:04,988
Rym: No matter how, if something amazing happens to either of us and then something else happens before we do the next GeekNights, whatever that amazing thing was, it's just gone.

22
00:01:05,169 --> 00:01:05,431
Rym: Oh, yeah.

23
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,300
Rym: Gone forever, like tears in the rain.

24
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,329
Scott: All right, so I managed to remember a thing.

25
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:11,840
Scott: So I went to this, they're in Queens, right?

26
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,810
Scott: They're changing all the bus routes like from scratch.

27
00:01:15,332 --> 00:01:17,660
Scott: So the MTA is like, "All right, erase the bus map.

28
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:28,568
Scott: Let's draw a new bus route map from nothing to be as good as possible and then let's go out and see what the people think and then let's do workshops and we'll work on it for like a year or

29
00:01:28,628 --> 00:01:28,909
Scott: so.".

30
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:33,458
Rym: And then we're like, "This is real important 'cause Queens like buses are real important in New

31
00:01:33,498 --> 00:01:33,660
Rym: York.".

32
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:42,728
Scott: If you aren't close enough to walk to the subway or the subway near you doesn't go where you want to go, right, the bus is real important.

33
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,160
Scott: As some neighborhoods, like there is just no subway.

34
00:01:45,301 --> 00:01:45,525
Scott: Yeah.

35
00:01:45,545 --> 00:01:46,418
Scott: If you don't have a car.

36
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:50,420
Rym: Part of why my rent is so high is while I have a- You don't want to take a cab everywhere.

37
00:01:51,301 --> 00:01:59,714
Rym: My apartment costs more than Scotts and is not as nice as Scotts, but because it's next to a subway station, like that's the selling point.

38
00:01:59,815 --> 00:02:01,280
Scott: Only by a few blocks.

39
00:02:02,301 --> 00:02:07,840
Scott: Anyway, so I go to this local townie community government meeting, right?

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,732
Scott: You know, a state senator, not my state senator, but the adjacent state senator.

41
00:02:12,495 --> 00:02:14,000
Scott: This badass lady, she's there.

42
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,845
Rym: But still, think about this.

43
00:02:15,906 --> 00:02:22,758
Rym: This is like the local town discussion for a borough of a city that itself has 2.2 million people in it.

44
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,830
Scott: Well, no, one neighborhood of Queens.

45
00:02:26,251 --> 00:02:28,760
Scott: It was just like Astoria, you know, only.

46
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:30,360
Rym: So, okay, so let's see.

47
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,300
Scott: So, it filled the meeting room of an old folks home full of folding chairs, right?

48
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:35,882
Scott: Alright.

49
00:02:36,264 --> 00:02:38,155
Rym: So, a neighborhood that has 10,000 people in it.

50
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,146
Scott: Yeah, you know, like it would be like the equivalent- Wait, no, that's a different Astoria.

51
00:02:42,347 --> 00:02:43,232
Rym: That's Astoria, Oregon.

52
00:02:43,272 --> 00:02:44,540
Rym: I was about to say 10,000 seem low.

53
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:45,699
Scott: Yeah, it's way low.

54
00:02:46,721 --> 00:02:47,468
Rym: A neighborhood of 120,000 people.

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,269
Scott: Right, yeah.

56
00:02:51,309 --> 00:02:54,160
Scott: So, I go, you know, the local politicians are there, right?

57
00:02:54,822 --> 00:02:59,799
Scott: My city councilman, who is trying to become borough president, shows up for five minutes and leaves, right?

58
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:04,954
Scott: You know, my Albany representative in the assembly, she's there.

59
00:03:04,994 --> 00:03:06,277
Scott: She's got plenty of time.

60
00:03:06,298 --> 00:03:08,044
Rym: I always see her- I like to go to things like this.

61
00:03:08,165 --> 00:03:11,420
Rym: I always wanted to when we lived upstate, but they always scheduled them while I was at work.

62
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,779
Rym: That's how only old people could go.

63
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,620
Scott: Anyway, the point is I had to go because MTA representatives are there and I need to use this bus.

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,067
Scott: Yup.

65
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:21,272
Scott: And, you know, I had to find out the info about this bus.

66
00:03:21,332 --> 00:03:23,140
Scott: It was kind of important to my everyday life.

67
00:03:23,221 --> 00:03:25,620
Scott: So, that'll get you out of the house to go to a townie thing.

68
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,800
Rym: Yup, and they're going to like every, like there's a million of these meetings.

69
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,610
Scott: Oh, yeah, there's tons of them, right?

70
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,220
Scott: And there have been a bunch before, right?

71
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:39,638
Scott: So, first of all, right, as you would expect what the composition of the room, whatever you're imagining the composition of the room to be, right?

72
00:03:41,023 --> 00:03:42,320
Scott: Add some diversity because it's Queens.

73
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,580
Rym: Yup, I imagine a lot of angry old people yelling about nonsense.

74
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:50,280
Scott: Remember, it is in an old folks home and yeah, at least half old folks.

75
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:50,660
Scott: Yeah.

76
00:03:50,921 --> 00:03:56,740
Scott: Right, but yeah, you know, you have people who with reasonable complaint, right?

77
00:03:57,064 --> 00:03:57,176
Scott: Yup.

78
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,400
Scott: Almost, I thought I was going to be one of the only people there.

79
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,040
Scott: I was like, man, I have to go because it's the meetings like in sort of near where I used to live, closer to the subway.

80
00:04:06,841 --> 00:04:10,839
Scott: I got to make sure there's some representation from Western Queens who are taking away this one bus.

81
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,640
Rym: Yeah, Western Queens is growing like in population.

82
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,312
Scott: From people near the water, right?

83
00:04:15,332 --> 00:04:16,300
Scott: They're taking away this bus.

84
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:19,860
Scott: I got to go and be like, hey, don't take away this bus, right?

85
00:04:20,202 --> 00:04:21,719
Rym: Even I care about this bus.

86
00:04:22,383 --> 00:04:23,580
Scott: Me, the Rym who hates buses.

87
00:04:23,821 --> 00:04:25,240
Scott: I don't think you've ever taken the 103 in your life.

88
00:04:25,584 --> 00:04:26,219
Rym: I think I have.

89
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,520
Scott: You would need it if you wanted to go to the Astoria ferry, but you just go to the LIC ferry.

90
00:04:31,867 --> 00:04:32,080
Scott: Anyway.

91
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,000
Rym: Oh, I'm thinking of the bus that took me to College Point.

92
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:34,820
Rym: It's not the 103.

93
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,980
Scott: I don't know what bus you're talking about.

94
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:41,460
Scott: Anyway, so I'm thinking I'm going to be the ones like represent that bus, right?

95
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,800
Scott: And, you know, be like, hey, we got to get to the water.

96
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,820
Scott: How can I get to the, you know, my city councilman.

97
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,280
Scott: The first thing he says is like, yeah, 103, what the hell?

98
00:04:52,102 --> 00:04:59,595
Scott: And then the MTA guy, before he even starts, he's like, all right, who here is here to complain about the 103 and the 90% of the rumors.

99
00:05:01,742 --> 00:05:04,020
Scott: He's like, he's like, the ridership has been real low.

100
00:05:04,201 --> 00:05:07,040
Scott: And I'm like, yeah, it's because you only run that off.

101
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,259
Scott: You only run it that often.

102
00:05:08,361 --> 00:05:10,339
Scott: So everyone doesn't bother to wait for it.

103
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:15,080
Scott: It's a, you know, it's a induced demand or, you know, the opposite of induced demand.

104
00:05:15,141 --> 00:05:16,879
Scott: When you make something sucks and no one uses it.

105
00:05:17,741 --> 00:05:20,040
Rym: Most mass transit in America has that problem.

106
00:05:20,561 --> 00:05:22,053
Rym: They make it suck and then no one rides it.

107
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,999
Rym: But if they made it better, everyone would ride it.

108
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:25,440
Scott: Right.

109
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:36,419
Scott: So anyway, so the funny comment number one that I heard at least two or three times was angry, really somewhat angry, really upset and frustrated person.

110
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:39,499
Scott: be like, you know, you guys, how can you put this on us?

111
00:05:39,841 --> 00:05:42,438
Scott: You know, changing all the bus routes we depend on.

112
00:05:43,183 --> 00:05:44,479
Scott: You don't come to the community.

113
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,620
Scott: It's like they're literally coming to the community.

114
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:47,942
Scott: Right.

115
00:05:48,245 --> 00:05:49,800
Scott: This is them coming to the community.

116
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,259
Scott: They already said this is like a draft.

117
00:05:52,681 --> 00:05:56,179
Scott: And this not what won't happen this year and might not even happen next year.

118
00:05:56,524 --> 00:05:57,599
Scott: And they're still working on it.

119
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,360
Scott: And here they are to hear what you have to say of their just first draft.

120
00:06:01,501 --> 00:06:08,180
Scott: And this they explained how they came up with it, trying to make buses straighter and have less traffic and all that, you know, right.

121
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,160
Scott: They explained to you the whole thing and they're here to hear from you.

122
00:06:11,301 --> 00:06:13,218
Scott: And people like, how come you don't come in here from us?

123
00:06:14,002 --> 00:06:18,300
Scott: It's like, OK, multiple people said that this is why I don't trust people.

124
00:06:18,641 --> 00:06:21,280
Scott: And these are and those are people who go to a community meeting.

125
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,719
Scott: One hundred percent of that room was voted.

126
00:06:22,941 --> 00:06:23,687
Scott: Yeah, for sure.

127
00:06:23,707 --> 00:06:24,856
Scott: So, yeah.

128
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:33,536
Scott: Anyway, the one comment that was just I could not ignore that makes it open a bit worthy was some crazy dude.

129
00:06:33,838 --> 00:06:34,040
Scott: Right.

130
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:34,764
Scott: It's crazy.

131
00:06:34,784 --> 00:06:36,259
Scott: He was recording the meeting on his iPad.

132
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,004
Rym: Whoa.

133
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:37,287
Rym: OK.

134
00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:38,339
Scott: All right.

135
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,098
Scott: It's an important meeting on his iPad.

136
00:06:40,138 --> 00:06:40,300
Scott: Right.

137
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,206
Scott: He's recording everything.

138
00:06:41,266 --> 00:06:43,220
Rym: Well, he's he's making his kill list, probably.

139
00:06:43,341 --> 00:06:44,407
Scott: I don't know what this guy's doing.

140
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:47,869
Scott: So he's like, he's like, it tastes like I've been to all these meetings.

141
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:51,269
Scott: This guy's going around to MTA meetings, like all of them, apparently.

142
00:06:51,309 --> 00:06:53,440
Rym: I mean, I could see myself doing that.

143
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,760
Scott: And he says, how come you don't answer the question right that we all want answered?

144
00:06:58,081 --> 00:06:59,531
Scott: He's like, you never answer us.

145
00:06:59,974 --> 00:07:00,779
Scott: And I'm like, us who?

146
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:01,503
Rym: Yeah.

147
00:07:01,523 --> 00:07:02,277
Scott: Speak for yourself, bro.

148
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:03,267
Scott: Right.

149
00:07:03,328 --> 00:07:04,038
Scott: The royal us.

150
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:09,620
Scott: And he starts talking about something that is a true, but I didn't know it until now.

151
00:07:10,202 --> 00:07:12,191
Scott: And then be completely crazy after that.

152
00:07:12,472 --> 00:07:14,782
Scott: He starts off completely true and I learned something.

153
00:07:15,324 --> 00:07:17,273
Scott: So he's valuable education.

154
00:07:17,694 --> 00:07:18,880
Scott: And then he goes off the deep end.

155
00:07:19,247 --> 00:07:19,452
Scott: All right.

156
00:07:19,493 --> 00:07:19,698
Scott: Right.

157
00:07:20,101 --> 00:07:27,159
Scott: So he starts and he talks about, uh, when they, you know, when Bloomberg conglomerated the buses and I'm like, what?

158
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,719
Scott: Well, so we always talk about how the subway has like the IRT.

159
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:35,320
Scott: They used to be the IRT and the BMD independent line.

160
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:35,942
Scott: Right.

161
00:07:35,962 --> 00:07:38,960
Scott: The buses used to be all private buses.

162
00:07:39,962 --> 00:07:45,015
Scott: And they were not combined into the MTA until like, yes, Bloomberg, like 2005, six, seven.

163
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,079
Rym: Which is probably another reason why our buses kind of.

164
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:53,740
Scott: There were buses like queen surface and they'd said queen surface on them.

165
00:07:53,921 --> 00:07:57,260
Scott: And that was a bus and it wasn't a public bus also.

166
00:07:57,921 --> 00:07:58,162
Scott: Right.

167
00:07:58,283 --> 00:07:59,047
Scott: I didn't know this.

168
00:07:59,489 --> 00:08:03,049
Scott: Some of the buses that still run that look, they just look like a city bus.

169
00:08:03,069 --> 00:08:03,674
Scott: You get on them.

170
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:04,420
Scott: It's a city bus.

171
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,625
Scott: You use your Metro card.

172
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:06,389
Scott: It looks perfect.

173
00:08:06,429 --> 00:08:08,559
Scott: It looks like it's a public bus in all ways.

174
00:08:09,143 --> 00:08:12,160
Scott: Is operated by a private bus company, right?

175
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,318
Rym: Like the early days of the IRT being run by the MTA.

176
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,580
Scott: It would be as if there was still an IRT company.

177
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,200
Scott: And there was people working there and they, and they operated trains.

178
00:08:22,861 --> 00:08:23,162
Scott: Right.

179
00:08:23,283 --> 00:08:30,659
Scott: That said on them, MTA, New York city transit subway, but there's a private company being paid to operate them.

180
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,122
Scott: Right.

181
00:08:31,142 --> 00:08:32,900
Scott: So there's still buses like that somewhere.

182
00:08:33,241 --> 00:08:33,482
Scott: Right.

183
00:08:34,085 --> 00:08:45,200
Scott: So apparently what happened is they bought out all these private bus companies and incorporated them into this MTA bus company, but there's actually two bus companies and there was some shenanigans.

184
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,100
Scott: There's like M. they formed the MTA bus company.

185
00:08:48,343 --> 00:08:49,152
Scott: And then this other one.

186
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:49,699
Rym: All right.

187
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,539
Scott: So I learned all that stuff from this dude.

188
00:08:51,741 --> 00:09:04,060
Scott: But then this dude went off the rails with some, not, you know, not as crazy as a sovereign citizen saying the law doesn't matter, but possibly making up things out of whole cloth.

189
00:09:05,001 --> 00:09:06,994
Rym: He said, might just be an R W N J.

190
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,522
Scott: I don't know.

191
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:21,120
Scott: But he said that when the buses were all combined, right, there was some agreement that they would not remove bus lines or merge them into New York city transit.

192
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:26,400
Scott: And therefore the MTA doesn't have the power to redo all the bus routes.

193
00:09:26,902 --> 00:09:27,163
Scott: Right.

194
00:09:27,243 --> 00:09:30,940
Scott: It could be sued by the union if the union wanted to Sue or something.

195
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,444
Rym: Okay.

196
00:09:32,504 --> 00:09:36,783
Scott: And I was like, uh, and then the MTA guy obviously doesn't answer the question.

197
00:09:36,803 --> 00:09:38,419
Rym: Well, the MTA guy is probably just like waiting.

198
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:46,680
Scott: Like I recognize that the MTA guy obviously had heard the same guy several times before and is not as a bus route expert and not a lawyer for the MTA.

199
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,760
Rym: Pretty sure that guy is going to be in long Island city tonight.

200
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:51,596
Rym: Oh, they're doing ours tonight.

201
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:51,960
Rym: Okay.

202
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,399
Rym: At six, I could miss a missus happening right now.

203
00:09:54,822 --> 00:09:56,959
Rym: That guy is probably right now at Jacob Reese.

204
00:09:58,062 --> 00:10:00,260
Scott: Well, there's like a long presentation before question time.

205
00:10:00,522 --> 00:10:02,440
Rym: He's sitting in the audience with his iPad right now waiting.

206
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:09,108
Scott: Anyway, the point is that, uh, the MTA guy was just like, yeah, I can't answer any questions about that.

207
00:10:09,128 --> 00:10:19,025
Scott: We're here to talk about these bus routes and whether the new routes work for you or if you want, you know, how you think we should adjust them or change them or make new ones or what's missing, you know?

208
00:10:19,045 --> 00:10:33,468
Scott: Uh, but it's like most of the people were just like, you know, they would, you know, regardless of how they would ask their question, like, you know, some exasperated person was like, uh, I have to go to mass, but then you took away the mass bus or you're not connecting the neighborhood.

209
00:10:33,488 --> 00:10:34,800
Scott: These neighborhoods have a connection.

210
00:10:35,982 --> 00:10:41,669
Scott: And the MTA guy is just like, all right, so we need, we still need a connection between Astoria and mass bath.

211
00:10:41,689 --> 00:10:42,091
Scott: I gotcha.

212
00:10:42,936 --> 00:10:51,011
Scott: He would just, he would just extract the actual route related suggestion from whatever crazy long rant he had to listen to.

213
00:10:51,413 --> 00:10:53,966
Scott: And then you're like, okay, you want to route to mass bed?

214
00:10:54,047 --> 00:10:54,329
Scott: Okay.

215
00:10:54,872 --> 00:10:57,705
Scott: And he would just quietly listen while the person ran it, whoever long.

216
00:10:57,725 --> 00:11:08,470
Scott: Uh, and that was that, but yeah, crazy dude is no matter what thing is being discussed at the townie meeting, there's always going to be some crazy person.

217
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:09,013
Rym: Yup.

218
00:11:09,515 --> 00:11:14,392
Rym: I, uh, my few experiences going to state good fight.

219
00:11:14,432 --> 00:11:14,874
Rym: Same.

220
00:11:15,195 --> 00:11:23,848
Scott: I did a cursory internet search and I could find nothing about an agreement not to move, emerge, or it is very sovereign.

221
00:11:23,929 --> 00:11:28,631
Scott: It's always this idea, like who's someone who thinks they know some laws.

222
00:11:28,912 --> 00:11:29,133
Scott: Yup.

223
00:11:29,234 --> 00:11:30,340
Scott: This is a made up stuff.

224
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,123
Rym: Well, it's all.

225
00:11:31,144 --> 00:11:34,039
Scott: therefore it's always, there is a do this and that.

226
00:11:34,099 --> 00:11:34,220
Rym: Yeah.

227
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,938
Rym: It's always, there is a technicality that is too difficult to explain.

228
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:42,677
Rym: that therefore undermines the legitimacy of a very legitimate.

229
00:11:42,718 --> 00:11:43,904
Scott: I'll say some magic words.

230
00:11:43,944 --> 00:11:46,034
Scott: Now the government has to do a thing, right?

231
00:11:46,777 --> 00:11:48,445
Rym: I did not make rejoinder with this bus.

232
00:11:49,329 --> 00:11:51,620
Rym: I am a prime, a free man traveling on the land.

233
00:11:51,900 --> 00:12:01,986
Scott: And obviously what he was saying was less crazy than what actual sovereign citizens say, but it was still, but it's the same sort of logic of magic words made up thing.

234
00:12:02,428 --> 00:12:09,276
Rym: Therefore law, you can't do it when people like that, like, especially in this case, like what does he want?

235
00:12:09,517 --> 00:12:11,546
Rym: Because you don't want independent bus lines.

236
00:12:11,586 --> 00:12:12,470
Rym: That's garbage.

237
00:12:12,912 --> 00:12:16,527
Rym: Like you want one cop thing to run all the mass transit.

238
00:12:16,548 --> 00:12:16,889
Rym: Right.

239
00:12:16,929 --> 00:12:18,154
Rym: But here's the thing, right?

240
00:12:18,174 --> 00:12:29,180
Scott: So if they had a subway, like kind of like has problems because of this, well, it's like, you know, okay, we have, but we, they're trying to improve the bus line, whether they're doing a good job or not is debatable.

241
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:29,622
Scott: Yeah.

242
00:12:29,722 --> 00:12:29,883
Scott: There's.

243
00:12:29,984 --> 00:12:31,210
Scott: obviously it's not perfect.

244
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,437
Scott: It's also a first draft.

245
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:39,960
Scott: If they just had a meeting to come and say, suggest changes to the current bus line, there would be a packed meeting of the same crazy ranting people.

246
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,281
Scott: Yup.

247
00:12:40,442 --> 00:12:40,684
Scott: Right.

248
00:12:40,804 --> 00:12:43,459
Scott: So why, if they have a meeting, we're going to change it.

249
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,234
Scott: People come crazy and rant, put it back the way it was.

250
00:12:46,535 --> 00:12:46,877
Scott: Okay.

251
00:12:47,098 --> 00:12:57,499
Scott: So if you say, put it back the way it was and make no changes and leave everything as is, then I expect if we have a meeting on how to change the current bus line, we're going to, or otherwise you're leaving it the way it is.

252
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,380
Scott: I expect you to stay home because you think the current bus line is perfect.

253
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:01,802
Scott: Great.

254
00:13:01,842 --> 00:13:05,063
Rym: They want everything to be different and they want nothing to change.

255
00:13:05,163 --> 00:13:05,606
Scott: Exactly.

256
00:13:05,646 --> 00:13:08,038
Scott: The same person would complain at both meetings.

257
00:13:08,178 --> 00:13:11,700
Scott: In my experience, these people, how come the bus doesn't come enough, right?

258
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:15,731
Scott: We're going to change the routes and hopefully try to fix some of these problems and work with DOT maybe.

259
00:13:15,872 --> 00:13:16,275
Scott: No change.

260
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,502
Scott: How come you're changing the bus line?

261
00:13:17,542 --> 00:13:19,170
Scott: What am I life undoing my life?

262
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,456
Rym: No take, only throw.

263
00:13:20,476 --> 00:13:20,556
Rym: Yeah.

264
00:13:20,576 --> 00:13:34,324
Scott: One, the one thing that I did here at the, the meeting that, you know, cause a lot of the things they complained about were things I also complained about, but the MTA at least, you know, appeared to have actually known these things, right?

265
00:13:34,344 --> 00:13:35,957
Scott: Like I was going to be like, ah, 21st street.

266
00:13:35,978 --> 00:13:38,413
Scott: They're like, yeah, we're working with the MTA on 21st street.

267
00:13:38,433 --> 00:13:42,173
Scott: They had already preemptively thought they were like, you know, accessibility.

268
00:13:42,233 --> 00:13:45,267
Scott: Everyone was like, eh, you know, I can't get around.

269
00:13:45,308 --> 00:13:46,252
Scott: I'm an old person.

270
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:48,343
Scott: There's no elevators at the subway.

271
00:13:48,665 --> 00:13:52,285
Scott: Even if I can get on the subway at Astoria Boulevard, let me finish the elevator.

272
00:13:52,527 --> 00:13:53,775
Scott: Where the hell can I get off?

273
00:13:54,017 --> 00:13:54,218
Scott: Right.

274
00:13:54,238 --> 00:13:55,566
Scott: There's no elevator where I'm going.

275
00:13:55,607 --> 00:13:55,868
Scott: Yup.

276
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:56,291
Scott: Right.

277
00:13:56,472 --> 00:14:03,676
Rym: The terrifying and sad thing about the New York city subway is a disability activist a while ago made this great map that showed the map of the New York city subway.

278
00:14:03,997 --> 00:14:05,042
Rym: If you're in a wheelchair.

279
00:14:05,082 --> 00:14:05,283
Scott: Right.

280
00:14:05,605 --> 00:14:15,129
Rym: And on one hand, it's way sparser than the full subway, but on the other hand, that map by itself is a better mass transit system than any other city in America.

281
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:15,431
Scott: Yeah.

282
00:14:15,491 --> 00:14:16,336
Scott: It's still garbage though.

283
00:14:16,376 --> 00:14:16,577
Scott: Yeah.

284
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,092
Scott: Uh, but the point is some billions from upstate.

285
00:14:19,294 --> 00:14:26,792
Scott: One thing, a lot of people complained about that the MTA did not take into consideration and didn't have like a, they didn't have like a response to that.

286
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:33,021
Scott: Like all the people like accessibility, they were like, yeah, we knew you were going to say that 21st street.

287
00:14:33,061 --> 00:14:34,330
Scott: We knew you were going to say that, right?

288
00:14:34,713 --> 00:14:48,215
Scott: When people, the thing that they messed up was that New York city buses, a lot of kids use that to go to school and there's a lot of bus stops around schools and there's a lot of, you know, and kids will often get on a bus, right?

289
00:14:48,496 --> 00:14:49,922
Scott: Take the bus and get off at school.

290
00:14:50,203 --> 00:14:50,464
Scott: Right.

291
00:14:50,946 --> 00:14:51,790
Scott: And that's how they do.

292
00:14:52,713 --> 00:14:59,300
Scott: And by changing the buses to be less and more straight kids are going to have to make transfers.

293
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,359
Scott: They don't know how to make or the bus stop won't be right next to the school.

294
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,153
Scott: And a kid might have to walk like two blocks to get to the school.

295
00:15:06,173 --> 00:15:14,881
Scott: And that might not be a problem for like high school or middle school even, but elementary school, but it's a problem for, you know, it's definitely a problem.

296
00:15:14,922 --> 00:15:15,062
Scott: Right.

297
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:25,963
Scott: And I think a lot of the bus routes originally, or a lot of the school placements originally, that is why we're done, you know, in concert.

298
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:34,592
Rym: And now they, you know, well, this gets back to a broader point where a lot of people who don't know anything about mass transit try to argue that buses are more flexible than trains.

299
00:15:34,894 --> 00:15:42,971
Rym: And that's bullshit because the real argument would be trains by the nature of their inflexibility guarantee access to a route.

300
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:44,497
Rym: It's hard to move a train line.

301
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:49,576
Rym: So you naturally build infrastructure around the paths of rail.

302
00:15:49,897 --> 00:15:55,025
Rym: Whereas a bus route, if you build infrastructure on a bus route, if it changes, all your infrastructure is now fucked.

303
00:15:56,692 --> 00:16:01,059
Scott: But yeah, they didn't seem to realize that on Vernon Boulevard, there's all these buildings under construction.

304
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:03,153
Scott: They're like, "No one uses the Vernon Boulevard bus.

305
00:16:03,193 --> 00:16:03,475
Scott: It's gone

306
00:16:03,515 --> 00:16:04,099
Scott: bye-bye.".

307
00:16:04,119 --> 00:16:05,768
Scott: And everyone's like, "No.

308
00:16:05,849 --> 00:16:07,779
Scott: How are we going to get to the ferry?

309
00:16:07,819 --> 00:16:08,947
Scott: How are we going to get to the park?

310
00:16:08,988 --> 00:16:10,359
Scott: How are we going to get to any of the water

311
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:10,500
Scott: stuff?".

312
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,301
Rym: Also, there's going to be an infinite number of apartments there before too long.

313
00:16:13,401 --> 00:16:15,313
Scott: It's like three giant apartment buildings.

314
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,004
Scott: One's done, but no one lives in it yet.

315
00:16:17,065 --> 00:16:18,314
Scott: And two are under construction.

316
00:16:18,656 --> 00:16:20,954
Scott: You're going to need something over there because those people, right?

317
00:16:21,136 --> 00:16:22,162
Rym: Well, you know, we need over there.

318
00:16:22,364 --> 00:16:26,847
Rym: We need a new subway line that goes through all of Australia and Queens and down into Brooklyn.

319
00:16:26,887 --> 00:16:33,635
Scott: Well, instead they're building, they're trying to build a somewhat corrupt light rail.

320
00:16:33,675 --> 00:16:35,200
Scott: that's not the subway.

321
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:42,835
Rym: I would be okay with a bunch of trams and light rails in the city if they were also building a bunch more full subways.

322
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:43,518
Scott: Yeah, anyway.

323
00:16:43,598 --> 00:16:45,506
Rym: Anyway, this isn't the New York City Transit Show.

324
00:16:46,007 --> 00:16:47,694
Scott: So, the news.

325
00:16:48,296 --> 00:16:50,707
Rym: So, "Ride Your Waves" is in theaters in the US.

326
00:16:50,787 --> 00:16:52,677
Scott: Well, it's going to be in theaters on one day.

327
00:16:53,641 --> 00:16:57,258
Scott: So, it's a new movie directed by Masaaki Yuasa, new anime.

328
00:16:57,339 --> 00:16:58,022
Scott: I guess it's not new.

329
00:16:58,063 --> 00:16:58,928
Scott: It's been out for a while.

330
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:01,121
Rym: We mentioned it on the last GeekNights.

331
00:17:01,202 --> 00:17:02,146
Scott: It came out in Japan.

332
00:17:02,206 --> 00:17:02,468
Scott: when?

333
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:03,975
Scott: I don't even know.

334
00:17:04,377 --> 00:17:05,119
Scott: Maybe sometime.

335
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,163
Scott: 2019.

336
00:17:06,163 --> 00:17:06,946
Scott: Yeah, something like that.

337
00:17:06,968 --> 00:17:07,209
Rym: June.

338
00:17:07,269 --> 00:17:08,115
Rym: June 2019.

339
00:17:08,115 --> 00:17:08,415
Scott: Right.

340
00:17:08,436 --> 00:17:16,771
Scott: So, now it's going to be in English in the US in the theaters with subtitles on February 19th and only February 19th.

341
00:17:16,832 --> 00:17:19,864
Scott: Now, Masaaki Yuasa has never steered me wrong.

342
00:17:19,964 --> 00:17:20,146
Rym: Nope.

343
00:17:20,387 --> 00:17:26,836
Scott: Everything Masaaki Yuasa has touched with their directorial hand has been gold or gold adjacent.

344
00:17:26,876 --> 00:17:29,268
Rym: But "Walk on Girl" I think is my favorite?

345
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:30,093
Scott: Yep, maybe.

346
00:17:30,214 --> 00:17:31,722
Scott: But I haven't finished watching "Tatami

347
00:17:31,742 --> 00:17:32,204
Scott: Galaxy."

348
00:17:32,445 --> 00:17:32,727
Scott: Yeah.

349
00:17:33,129 --> 00:17:34,877
Scott: Which is "Walk on Girl" adjacent.

350
00:17:34,917 --> 00:17:36,023
Rym: "Walk on Girl" long form.

351
00:17:36,164 --> 00:17:36,365
Scott: Yeah.

352
00:17:36,425 --> 00:17:37,651
Rym: Or "Walk on Girl the

353
00:17:37,692 --> 00:17:38,375
Rym: Wanderers."

354
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:38,757
Rym: Right.

355
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:40,084
Rym: There's an anime reference.

356
00:17:40,124 --> 00:17:41,411
Rym: None of you are old enough to remember.

357
00:17:42,134 --> 00:17:44,993
Scott: "Ride Your Wave," based on what I can tell about it.

358
00:17:45,013 --> 00:17:45,940
Scott: I didn't actually watch the trailer.

359
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:46,723
Scott: Perhaps I should.

360
00:17:46,743 --> 00:17:50,599
Scott: Appears to be the most boring Masaaki Yuasa.

361
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:54,634
Scott: It's just like a romantic comedy about a girl and a guy.

362
00:17:54,654 --> 00:17:55,517
Scott: It's very hetero.

363
00:17:55,939 --> 00:17:57,689
Scott: And the dude dies and he's a ghost.

364
00:17:57,931 --> 00:17:58,152
Scott: Yep.

365
00:17:58,293 --> 00:17:59,199
Scott: And it reminds me a lot of-.

366
00:17:59,219 --> 00:18:04,261
Rym: Well, like I said, it's transformation, water as metaphor for transformation and/or death.

367
00:18:04,442 --> 00:18:10,573
Scott: It reminds me of, you know, the famous ghost movie with Whoopi Goldberg and what's-his-face with the pottery.

368
00:18:10,734 --> 00:18:13,328
Rym: Also the other recent Yuasa movie with the mermaid.

369
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:14,675
Scott: Right, but less silly.

370
00:18:14,956 --> 00:18:18,175
Rym: But that one also was water as metaphor for transformation and death.

371
00:18:18,356 --> 00:18:24,626
Rym: When she turns, all the animals in the kill shelter into mermaids, like, pretty on the bottlenose there.

372
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:26,658
Scott: But anyway, you know, Japan's an island, right?

373
00:18:26,719 --> 00:18:27,201
Scott: They like water.

374
00:18:27,382 --> 00:18:33,710
Rym: But also, you live, like, if you live in America, just watch every anime movie that comes out in a theater.

375
00:18:33,771 --> 00:18:35,782
Rym: that is not a sequel to another anime series.

376
00:18:35,803 --> 00:18:43,080
Scott: So I mean, you know, I have less expectations for this than I do for other things with Yuasa's name on it, but I can go see it anyway.

377
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:43,381
Scott: Yeah.

378
00:18:43,401 --> 00:18:44,688
Rym: He hasn't steered me wrong.

379
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:47,021
Scott: And also, damn, that dude is prolific, right?

380
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,872
Scott: You look at, like, say Hosoda, right?

381
00:18:49,093 --> 00:18:54,112
Scott: Hosoda has been coming out with a new anime pretty much every three years.

382
00:18:54,574 --> 00:18:55,136
Scott: Exactly.

383
00:18:55,597 --> 00:19:01,217
Scott: Like, Summer Wars, one, two, three, Wolf and Boy, whatever that was called.

384
00:19:01,899 --> 00:19:03,107
Scott: What was the one with the wolf and the kid?

385
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:04,739
Rym: Oh, God, I forgot the title.

386
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,362
Rym: We reviewed it.

387
00:19:05,383 --> 00:19:06,206
Rym: I saw it.

388
00:19:06,508 --> 00:19:07,372
Scott: Yeah, right.

389
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:11,852
Scott: And then one, two, three, and then the one with the architect house that we just saw.

390
00:19:12,073 --> 00:19:12,294
Scott: Yeah.

391
00:19:12,314 --> 00:19:12,796
Rym: Right.

392
00:19:12,836 --> 00:19:14,024
Rym: I like that one.

393
00:19:14,064 --> 00:19:15,014
Scott: I do like that one a lot.

394
00:19:15,034 --> 00:19:15,519
Scott: I forget the name.

395
00:19:16,561 --> 00:19:16,863
Scott: I knew it.

396
00:19:17,266 --> 00:19:19,478
Scott: I saw it the other day, the name of it, and I forgot.

397
00:19:19,518 --> 00:19:19,720
Scott: All right.

398
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:22,762
Scott: Mirai.

399
00:19:23,284 --> 00:19:24,328
Rym: Yes, Mirai.

400
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:24,810
Rym: Mirai.

401
00:19:25,072 --> 00:19:27,703
Scott: And then I'm sure three years after Mirai was, what, last year?

402
00:19:27,723 --> 00:19:29,009
Scott: It's already one.

403
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:29,853
Rym: Was it two years ago?

404
00:19:29,873 --> 00:19:31,280
Rym: I lose track.

405
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:34,782
Scott: I feel like next year or the year after is going to be another Hosoda movie.

406
00:19:34,822 --> 00:19:36,613
Scott: The point is, that's every three years.

407
00:19:36,653 --> 00:19:41,896
Scott: Hosoda is putting out a movie, like, several per year, like two per year.

408
00:19:42,117 --> 00:19:45,793
Scott: He's just cranking him out, like, damn, are you sure you're not?

409
00:19:46,235 --> 00:19:48,908
Scott: I'm worried about overworked animators going on over there.

410
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:51,944
Rym: I haven't heard any bad stuff about those two years.

411
00:19:52,064 --> 00:19:53,471
Scott: No, they're putting out good work.

412
00:19:53,812 --> 00:19:58,313
Scott: But yeah, that's a lot of quantity over there to be having the quality.

413
00:19:58,816 --> 00:19:59,720
Rym: So some other news.

414
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,516
Rym: This is like weirdly big news in the anime world.

415
00:20:03,576 --> 00:20:07,050
Scott: It's big news in the US anime fan.

416
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:07,712
Rym: Here's the thing.

417
00:20:08,033 --> 00:20:17,468
Scott: In the scene of people who go to anime cons in the US and the scene of people who tweet about anime in the US or make YouTube videos about anime in the US.

418
00:20:17,488 --> 00:20:18,132
Rym: Yeah, there you go.

419
00:20:18,493 --> 00:20:27,303
Rym: This is big news among the subset of mostly white dudes who review anime on YouTube and like titty anime.

420
00:20:27,825 --> 00:20:33,244
Rym: That demographic is really butter about this and no one else cares.

421
00:20:33,586 --> 00:20:39,155
Rym: But good lord, if they saturated Anna Twitter and like every forum talking about this fucking show.

422
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:41,847
Rym: So basically what happened, I'm going to super summarize.

423
00:20:42,229 --> 00:20:47,192
Rym: There is this garbage porn manga called Interspecies Reviewers.

424
00:20:47,232 --> 00:20:53,181
Scott: Now, I'm not saying that you can guess from the title exactly what the fuck it's about and you would be exactly right.

425
00:20:53,242 --> 00:20:54,025
Rym: Well, yeah.

426
00:20:54,065 --> 00:20:57,682
Rym: So there's been a lot of Monster Girl type anime content lately.

427
00:20:57,823 --> 00:20:58,084
Rym: Oh, yeah.

428
00:20:58,245 --> 00:20:59,753
Rym: Of varying levels of quality.

429
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:06,085
Scott: But this is literally like they go around fucking different species and they review how good each species is at fucking.

430
00:21:06,105 --> 00:21:08,717
Rym: You go around and fuck like the cat girl.

431
00:21:08,918 --> 00:21:09,260
Scott: Oh, man.

432
00:21:09,881 --> 00:21:10,764
Scott: Lamia is great.

433
00:21:10,985 --> 00:21:13,573
Rym: You know, here's the thing.

434
00:21:13,653 --> 00:21:19,558
Rym: So this show, like all those other Monster Girl shows, like the one you're all thinking of monster.

435
00:21:19,699 --> 00:21:21,109
Rym: God, I don't know the names, any of these shows.

436
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:23,263
Rym: The one with the Lamia, like the red Lamia girl.

437
00:21:23,304 --> 00:21:24,551
Rym: That's like the one everyone knows.

438
00:21:25,114 --> 00:21:26,783
Rym: That's the first one that kind of made it big.

439
00:21:27,206 --> 00:21:28,815
Rym: They're at least like like a centaur.

440
00:21:28,835 --> 00:21:31,449
Rym: Like they're actually like monster girls and there's something going on.

441
00:21:31,489 --> 00:21:34,142
Rym: It's more like a edgy comedy type show.

442
00:21:34,704 --> 00:21:36,590
Rym: This is just porn.

443
00:21:36,971 --> 00:21:37,212
Rym: OK.

444
00:21:37,653 --> 00:21:38,817
Scott: And it's not hentai.

445
00:21:38,917 --> 00:21:40,563
Rym: It's not kind of is just hentai.

446
00:21:40,885 --> 00:21:46,269
Scott: I heard that it was basically like on the border line where it's not actually like it's on the border.

447
00:21:46,289 --> 00:21:46,389
Rym: It is.

448
00:21:46,891 --> 00:21:48,116
Rym: It is the border, right?

449
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:53,278
Scott: It is a razor's edge, but it's not just like completely explicit.

450
00:21:53,338 --> 00:21:55,165
Scott: We're showing everything right.

451
00:21:55,205 --> 00:22:01,748
Rym: This is way past Elvin Bride, like that level of like hentai comedy into.

452
00:22:01,768 --> 00:22:04,357
Rym: But here's the other thing.

453
00:22:04,377 --> 00:22:08,240
Rym: I read a bunch of reviews about it to see what the deal was, because apparently it's not even good.

454
00:22:08,761 --> 00:22:12,517
Rym: Like no one who knows anything thinks this show is good.

455
00:22:12,557 --> 00:22:18,706
Rym: All the reviews say it's kind of a garbage, low effort show with ridiculous, like big titty to anime girl nonsense.

456
00:22:18,766 --> 00:22:20,657
Rym: Like there is no reason to consume this.

457
00:22:20,698 --> 00:22:24,712
Rym: There is no value to the show, even if you're an anime titty type of person.

458
00:22:25,675 --> 00:22:30,798
Scott: But like, I'm sure like, you know, it's on the one hand, right?

459
00:22:30,879 --> 00:22:34,999
Rym: It's like, imagine anime titties the side, like double the size of basketball.

460
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,191
Rym: Like it's that level of absurd crap.

461
00:22:37,211 --> 00:22:38,820
Scott: Well, I mean, it's a. it's not a good show.

462
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,643
Scott: So if you if someone comes and says this is a good show that I cannot respect.

463
00:22:42,723 --> 00:22:42,944
Scott: Right.

464
00:22:43,185 --> 00:22:46,522
Scott: But if someone is just like, yeah, it's bad, but that's my fetish.

465
00:22:46,542 --> 00:22:48,230
Scott: I'm like, all right, you do you, bro.

466
00:22:48,592 --> 00:22:49,034
Scott: Right.

467
00:22:49,054 --> 00:22:57,792
Scott: But at the same time, if that is your fetish, wouldn't there be better things that are the same like, look, they're way better hentai.

468
00:22:57,812 --> 00:23:02,050
Scott: Like if you're in there a way better monster girl show, you're into monster girls.

469
00:23:02,352 --> 00:23:08,376
Scott: Aren't there hotter, better monster girl things to fat to than this one, right?

470
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:10,425
Scott: This can't be the best monster girl thing.

471
00:23:11,129 --> 00:23:13,279
Rym: There is a lot of monster girl counts, right?

472
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:14,325
Rym: There has to be a Sumi.

473
00:23:14,345 --> 00:23:15,815
Rym: That's the one that everyone knows, right?

474
00:23:15,835 --> 00:23:18,209
Scott: There has to be a better one to fat to than this one.

475
00:23:18,872 --> 00:23:19,053
Rym: Yeah.

476
00:23:19,094 --> 00:23:19,576
Rym: That one.

477
00:23:19,636 --> 00:23:20,461
Rym: That's the one everyone knows.

478
00:23:20,481 --> 00:23:20,742
Scott: Anyway.

479
00:23:20,762 --> 00:23:22,672
Scott: So what happened with this perverted show?

480
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:27,354
Scott: So funimation pick this show up and not know what it was.

481
00:23:27,374 --> 00:23:27,916
Rym: I don't know.

482
00:23:27,977 --> 00:23:29,745
Rym: They picked it up and they started dubbing it.

483
00:23:30,027 --> 00:23:31,052
Scott: I heard.

484
00:23:31,152 --> 00:23:32,580
Scott: I heard that they were going to dub it.

485
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,995
Scott: And I'm like, man, you got to know what the show is.

486
00:23:34,055 --> 00:23:36,027
Scott: If you're going to invest in dubbing and not just oven.

487
00:23:36,368 --> 00:23:36,629
Scott: Yeah.

488
00:23:36,951 --> 00:23:45,474
Rym: So, uh, they got a couple episodes in and then they immediately announced that they were going to cease dubbing it and it's not coming out anymore.

489
00:23:45,776 --> 00:23:49,174
Rym: And they issued a very simple statement quote after careful consideration.

490
00:23:49,455 --> 00:23:51,970
Rym: We determined that this series falls outside of our standards.

491
00:23:52,252 --> 00:23:53,942
Rym: We have the utmost respect for our creators.

492
00:23:54,243 --> 00:23:59,672
Rym: So rather than substantially altering the content, we felt it, we felt taking it down was the more respectful choice.

493
00:23:59,994 --> 00:24:05,342
Scott: Maybe that they, maybe what happened is they knew, okay, this is going to be one of those kinds of shows.

494
00:24:05,382 --> 00:24:17,599
Scott: And they had done shows like that before, but then when they were actually started working on it, you know, it's like episode one, episode two, and then like they watch, they were doing it as it came out.

495
00:24:18,022 --> 00:24:22,445
Scott: And then once they actually saw episode three, they were like, Oh, this goes over the line for us.

496
00:24:22,546 --> 00:24:22,767
Scott: Yep.

497
00:24:22,887 --> 00:24:27,409
Scott: Or maybe we thought it was just the regular old normal, you know, edgy kind of stuff.

498
00:24:27,711 --> 00:24:29,519
Scott: This is going to this go too far.

499
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,427
Scott: We're going to stop doing this now.

500
00:24:31,527 --> 00:24:31,648
Scott: So

501
00:24:31,728 --> 00:24:48,846
Rym: I see a lot of angry weebs who are all in the demographic we described before, which is an almost perfect overlap with the demographic of people at anime cons who wear that stupid Ahego shirt, uh, which is a giant sign that says, uh, please avoid me under all circumstances.

502
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:58,728
Rym: But what they're mad about is that this is funimation, like trying to police sexuality and police started doing the show in the first place.

503
00:24:58,788 --> 00:24:59,755
Scott: Would you be saying that?

504
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:02,148
Rym: And then they're like, but what about Penny and stocking?

505
00:25:02,188 --> 00:25:03,596
Rym: Was that over the line?

506
00:25:03,757 --> 00:25:06,252
Scott: Like they don't any inside needs even close to this show.

507
00:25:06,293 --> 00:25:15,334
Rym: Like they don't like the people who are mad about this have no sense of context or nuance or the idea or something can be close to the line and not over it.

508
00:25:15,354 --> 00:25:17,526
Scott: Something can be close to the line and over it.

509
00:25:17,607 --> 00:25:19,276
Rym: This is a trend I see generally in.

510
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:25,405
Rym: like anime fandom in particular, but it is in other areas as a company, freedom of speech, whatever.

511
00:25:25,667 --> 00:25:30,703
Scott: Like if someone who was, if the government was saying this show is banned from the U S then I'd be like, yeah, fuck your censorship.

512
00:25:30,743 --> 00:25:32,395
Scott: But no, it's like, we're funimation.

513
00:25:32,415 --> 00:25:33,200
Scott: We're a private company.

514
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,111
Scott: We can do whatever we want and we don't want to do this.

515
00:25:35,312 --> 00:25:37,265
Scott: So, but they don't want to do it.

516
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:37,991
Rym: They don't have to do it.

517
00:25:38,052 --> 00:25:38,980
Rym: It's like that wint tweet.

518
00:25:39,061 --> 00:25:41,338
Rym: Like there's no difference between good things and bad things.

519
00:25:41,358 --> 00:25:47,143
Rym: Like these are people who like cannot understand that two different situations are in different.

520
00:25:48,308 --> 00:25:52,745
Rym: So somehow this is like the biggest news in the anime community and TLDR.

521
00:25:53,107 --> 00:25:56,785
Rym: it's a crappy show that was way more pointy than the funimation expected.

522
00:25:57,268 --> 00:25:58,012
Rym: So they dropped it.

523
00:25:58,273 --> 00:25:58,373
Scott: Yeah.

524
00:25:58,393 --> 00:26:00,242
Scott: I mean, if you want to fat to it though, go ahead.

525
00:26:00,262 --> 00:26:04,742
Scott: It's not, it's not my bag, but I'm sure you could find a better bag.

526
00:26:04,762 --> 00:26:05,965
Scott: That's the same colored bag.

527
00:26:06,286 --> 00:26:06,687
Rym: Yeah.

528
00:26:07,188 --> 00:26:09,314
Rym: Like good Lord.

529
00:26:09,575 --> 00:26:18,022
Scott: But the, the, the, also videos about it, if you want to fat to it, do you really need a dub or sub?

530
00:26:18,665 --> 00:26:18,926
Rym: Yeah.

531
00:26:18,987 --> 00:26:19,710
Rym: Like, well, yes.

532
00:26:20,273 --> 00:26:21,800
Rym: I feel like you just need an animated gif.

533
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:25,345
Scott: I feel like you can just watch it raw, baby.

534
00:26:25,385 --> 00:26:26,175
Scott: I like it wrong.

535
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:38,817
Rym: But anyway, it's time for things of the day.

536
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:44,680
Rym: So, uh, many of you, if you don't know, uh, Sarah Anderson, you've probably seen Sarah Anderson comics.

537
00:26:44,801 --> 00:26:48,862
Scott: You see a Sarah Anderson comic and then some, and you'd be like, oh, I've seen those.

538
00:26:49,446 --> 00:26:56,468
Scott: And then, well, now, you know, that's a comic by Sarah Anderson and you can search for Sarah Anderson and find Sarah Anderson things that are adjacent to that.

539
00:26:56,629 --> 00:26:58,820
Rym: So Sarah Anderson's got a new ish comic.

540
00:26:58,981 --> 00:27:03,524
Rym: Like it's pretty new and it's drawn in a very different style and it's utterly adorable.

541
00:27:03,625 --> 00:27:07,343
Rym: And weirdly enough, it is actually kind of adjacent to my news.

542
00:27:07,624 --> 00:27:13,361
Scott: Today's GeekNights brought to you by the word monster girl orthogonal.

543
00:27:14,085 --> 00:27:23,709
Rym: It's called fangs and it's a serial and the comic is like a four comedy kind of thing, but it's about this vampire girl who starts dating a werewolf dude.

544
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:24,533
Scott: That's pretty normal.

545
00:27:24,735 --> 00:27:26,283
Rym: And like, she's just like, she's a vampire.

546
00:27:26,324 --> 00:27:28,798
Rym: Like she just kills people and he's a werewolf.

547
00:27:28,838 --> 00:27:29,843
Scott: Vampires do bro.

548
00:27:30,184 --> 00:27:32,776
Rym: And this comic is adorable and delightful.

549
00:27:32,896 --> 00:27:34,041
Rym: And I recommend you all read it.

550
00:27:34,383 --> 00:27:34,664
Rym: Okay.

551
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:41,276
Rym: So it's little comics like she's asleep because they were on a date and he wakes up and he's like, good morning.

552
00:27:41,297 --> 00:27:45,523
Rym: And he opens the blinds and then she catches on fire and he closes the blinds like, oh no, I'm so sorry.

553
00:27:47,109 --> 00:27:48,956
Rym: Or she starts telling the story like, yeah.

554
00:27:48,996 --> 00:27:55,380
Rym: So I was like eating this dude once and I bit him through the artery and the blood whenever it was like dragged him into the tub and there's blood everywhere.

555
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:59,159
Rym: And as he was like the tub and as he was bleeding out, I laughed.

556
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:03,823
Rym: And I just told, I told him before he faded out, like, Hey, this sure turned into a blood bath.

557
00:28:03,863 --> 00:28:05,047
Rym: And he's just like fist bump.

558
00:28:06,955 --> 00:28:07,738
Rym: It's just really cute.

559
00:28:07,899 --> 00:28:08,120
Rym: Okay.

560
00:28:09,343 --> 00:28:13,060
Scott: So, uh, there was a movie that came out live action movie called parasite.

561
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:13,964
Scott: You may have heard of it.

562
00:28:13,985 --> 00:28:15,694
Scott: Uh, it's a pretty big deal.

563
00:28:16,036 --> 00:28:16,720
Rym: I haven't seen it yet.

564
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,808
Rym: I plan to it's Korean movie.

565
00:28:19,028 --> 00:28:20,775
Scott: It is a great movie.

566
00:28:21,056 --> 00:28:22,100
Scott: I pointedly avoided.

567
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:25,644
Rym: Like I literally don't know what it's about and I'm avoiding it's about capitalism.

568
00:28:25,784 --> 00:28:26,508
Scott: Yeah.

569
00:28:26,568 --> 00:28:28,478
Rym: I've heard that and that's all I need to say.

570
00:28:28,518 --> 00:28:29,343
Scott: I spoiled the whole movie.

571
00:28:29,383 --> 00:28:31,598
Rym: I don't want to know anything else about it until I see it.

572
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,687
Scott: There's nothing else to know.

573
00:28:33,707 --> 00:28:35,337
Rym: I mean, I went into walk on girl.

574
00:28:35,377 --> 00:28:39,415
Rym: the night is long, not even knowing like what it was about, whatever.

575
00:28:39,435 --> 00:28:42,066
Scott: Uh, I don't think spoilers can ruin parasites.

576
00:28:42,106 --> 00:28:42,508
Scott: Greatness.

577
00:28:42,608 --> 00:28:45,843
Scott: The point is, uh, if you haven't seen it, go see it.

578
00:28:46,064 --> 00:28:54,075
Scott: Unlike Rym who hasn't, I plan to, but the director, uh, and also the, uh, actor of the main ish character, right.

579
00:28:54,557 --> 00:28:58,375
Scott: Uh, are here in this YouTube video on what vanity fairs, YouTube channel.

580
00:28:58,757 --> 00:28:58,998
Scott: Right.

581
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:03,015
Scott: And what they're doing is they're breaking down in great detail.

582
00:29:03,035 --> 00:29:05,144
Scott: Uh, the first scene of the movie.

583
00:29:05,405 --> 00:29:06,450
Rym: Ooh, I love this like that.

584
00:29:07,033 --> 00:29:08,902
Scott: And they really break it down.

585
00:29:09,184 --> 00:29:12,279
Scott: It is quite fascinating, you know, on many levels, right?

586
00:29:12,299 --> 00:29:14,697
Scott: They're talking about the metaphor of the things that are happening.

587
00:29:14,738 --> 00:29:17,734
Scott: They talk about the actual like making of like, Oh yeah.

588
00:29:17,754 --> 00:29:19,262
Scott: And this scene, this was all real.

589
00:29:19,362 --> 00:29:23,159
Scott: And the stuff back there was made by graphic like VFX, right?

590
00:29:23,199 --> 00:29:27,599
Scott: You know, the soundstage ends about here and this is where the CG starts, right?

591
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,968
Rym: I love videos like that.

592
00:29:28,988 --> 00:29:31,928
Scott: You're getting all these different details from all these different angles, right?

593
00:29:31,968 --> 00:29:55,208
Scott: The stories of the experience of, you know, how it was filming the scene or talking about the other actors and all this kind of, so, uh, if you've seen the movie, you can come and watch this and also go around YouTube and other places looking for other, you know, because this isn't the, you know, usually a lot of times the commentary on DVDs or extras or whatever it is these days, wherever you get extras these days and the days of digital

594
00:29:55,228 --> 00:29:59,187
Rym: always think back to eco horror is commentary on the your tenant movie.

595
00:29:59,207 --> 00:30:03,266
Scott: They vary wildly in quality and content, right?

596
00:30:03,366 --> 00:30:07,145
Scott: But here, this is my favorite kind because I don't like the commentary.

597
00:30:07,165 --> 00:30:08,496
Scott: We have to watch the whole thing again.

598
00:30:08,536 --> 00:30:09,644
Scott: And they're talking the whole time.

599
00:30:10,026 --> 00:30:11,475
Scott: This is like, you know, brief.

600
00:30:11,535 --> 00:30:12,662
Scott: It's like, how long is this video?

601
00:30:12,883 --> 00:30:14,513
Scott: Five minutes, 10 minutes, 13 minutes, 13 minutes.

602
00:30:14,653 --> 00:30:17,880
Rym: Remember way back where you're watching all the commentaries for like old South parks.

603
00:30:18,202 --> 00:30:20,176
Rym: And they only go for like five minutes in the beginning.

604
00:30:20,216 --> 00:30:22,069
Rym: And then they just, there's no more commentary, right?

605
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:27,344
Scott: It's like, that's what I like is, you know, I don't want to have to rewatch the whole thing with the running commentary the whole time.

606
00:30:27,384 --> 00:30:30,598
Rym: The commentary is dense and good the entire time.

607
00:30:30,618 --> 00:30:32,085
Scott: It's really hard to do, right?

608
00:30:32,286 --> 00:30:36,123
Scott: But by, you know, just a short commentary, that's really fascinating.

609
00:30:36,183 --> 00:30:44,325
Scott: It can satisfy my need for meta about the thing, uh, without having, you know, if I want to watch the movie again, I'll just watch it again and learn on my own.

610
00:30:44,345 --> 00:30:44,606
Scott: Right.

611
00:30:45,249 --> 00:30:48,507
Rym: So in the meta moment, the book club book is still the tale of Genji.

612
00:30:48,688 --> 00:30:49,614
Rym: I am reading through it.

613
00:30:49,634 --> 00:30:51,122
Rym: I am learning about Genji.

614
00:30:51,564 --> 00:30:55,558
Rym: Everyone is cooler than Genji, even though it's Genji's tail.

615
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:56,040
Rym: Yeah.

616
00:30:56,361 --> 00:31:01,980
Scott: It's sort of like, it's just sort of like what happens about Frodo or Bilbo.

617
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,689
Scott: I mean, it's increasingly cooler.

618
00:31:04,889 --> 00:31:12,438
Rym: It's more like what happens or like due to the circumstances of Genji's birth and life, what happens around Genji?

619
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,106
Rym: Like Genji's Genji's.

620
00:31:14,146 --> 00:31:15,112
Rym: It's almost like 10 G Muyo.

621
00:31:15,132 --> 00:31:22,629
Rym: Like no one gives a about 10 G that care about everything, but 10 G I'm getting that same vibe from the tail of Genji that I'm supposed to care about.

622
00:31:23,011 --> 00:31:24,357
Rym: Literally everyone else.

623
00:31:24,538 --> 00:31:27,788
Scott: Genji Muyo, Genji Muyo.

624
00:31:28,529 --> 00:31:29,552
Rym: No need for Genji.

625
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:31,658
Scott: Genji in Tokyo.

626
00:31:31,718 --> 00:31:32,962
Rym: Has anyone made that joke?

627
00:31:33,665 --> 00:31:34,590
Rym: I got to, we'll see.

628
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,319
Rym: Well, we'll talk about this at some point.

629
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:44,522
Rym: We'll, we'll pick a stopping point and talk about how, what we've read up to that point and do like, this'll take probably four or five GeekNights book club shows.

630
00:31:44,703 --> 00:31:45,044
Rym: Who knows?

631
00:31:45,587 --> 00:31:46,772
Rym: Uh, I'm enjoying it.

632
00:31:47,013 --> 00:31:48,519
Scott: It's just, yeah, it's a thing.

633
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:52,393
Scott: It's the first novel ever in the history of humanity.

634
00:31:52,454 --> 00:31:53,799
Scott: The first novel.

635
00:31:53,839 --> 00:32:02,038
Scott: It's not the first fiction, obviously, is the first fiction in the form of a book that could be called a novel and not say an epic poem or something like that.

636
00:32:02,439 --> 00:32:14,434
Rym: Our brand new panel from PAX South 2020, the 41 tabletop games you should play is just on YouTube and we will be live at PAX East, which is coming up with Take Your Fucking Turn, which we did at PAX Unplugged.

637
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:18,459
Scott: So if you are going to PAX East, you don't have to waste your time coming to see us at PAX East.

638
00:32:18,479 --> 00:32:20,911
Scott: You can just watch this video on PAX Unplugged.

639
00:32:21,232 --> 00:32:26,177
Scott: and at PAX East you can, instead of going to our panel, go to a different panel, play some games.

640
00:32:26,217 --> 00:32:33,316
Rym: The differences between the YouTube video and we did this at PAX Unplugged and when we do it at PAX East, we'll be like, two slides will be tweaked.

641
00:32:33,558 --> 00:32:34,944
Rym: We'll tell a couple different jokes.

642
00:32:35,005 --> 00:32:36,853
Scott: We'll say the word Boston instead of Philly.

643
00:32:36,994 --> 00:32:37,255
Scott: Yep.

644
00:32:37,778 --> 00:32:42,986
Rym: We won't be as, we won't talk about how much we hate Boston as much as we talked about how much we hate Philly.

645
00:32:43,026 --> 00:32:43,912
Scott: I don't hate Boston.

646
00:32:44,153 --> 00:32:46,263
Scott: Get a different New Yorker if you want to hate Boston.

647
00:32:46,303 --> 00:32:46,543
Scott: Yeah.

648
00:32:46,904 --> 00:32:48,829
Scott: There's plenty to choose from.

649
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:53,342
Rym: What did I, someone, I saw a Philly.

650
00:32:53,864 --> 00:32:54,807
Rym: I don't hate Boston.

651
00:32:55,148 --> 00:32:58,320
Rym: Boston is beneath my contempt, but I hate Philly.

652
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,501
Scott: Like I'm not like a Boston fan, but I don't hate them like other New Yorkers do.

653
00:33:02,602 --> 00:33:05,717
Rym: I mean, Boston is one of the few cities in America.

654
00:33:05,737 --> 00:33:06,220
Scott: They hate me.

655
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:06,722
Scott: They hate us.

656
00:33:06,822 --> 00:33:07,043
Scott: Yeah.

657
00:33:07,204 --> 00:33:10,098
Rym: But there's jealous, but they got some mass transit.

658
00:33:10,138 --> 00:33:14,315
Rym: Like they actually have a semi-functional like subway train system.

659
00:33:14,395 --> 00:33:16,543
Rym: Kind of more so than most places.

660
00:33:16,824 --> 00:33:17,828
Rym: Way better than DC.

661
00:33:17,868 --> 00:33:18,350
Rym: Good luck.

662
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:18,832
Rym: Good Lord.

663
00:33:19,032 --> 00:33:19,333
Scott: Kinda.

664
00:33:19,795 --> 00:33:20,156
Scott: Kinda.

665
00:33:20,176 --> 00:33:20,257
Scott: Yeah.

666
00:33:22,121 --> 00:33:23,966
Rym: First, Philly's is actually not that bad.

667
00:33:23,986 --> 00:33:28,942
Rym: Anyway, so anime movie weathering with you.

668
00:33:29,062 --> 00:33:31,375
Rym: We saw it, we got, I saw it a while ago in the theater.

669
00:33:31,395 --> 00:33:31,616
Scott: Right.

670
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:43,375
Scott: So to review, Makoto Shinkai, this dude we found out about when we were in college, when we saw Hoshino Koi, the story that we learned was that this was some dude who made an anime, a very short anime in like his basement with his wife.

671
00:33:43,496 --> 00:33:45,886
Rym: Voices of a distant star Hoshino Koi.

672
00:33:46,087 --> 00:33:46,268
Rym: Right.

673
00:33:46,368 --> 00:33:56,822
Scott: And it was this, you know, very moving, very short tiered jerky and short animation about young lovers separated by space and time.

674
00:33:56,842 --> 00:33:58,247
Rym: Yup.

675
00:33:58,327 --> 00:33:59,251
Rym: To 2002, this came out.

676
00:33:59,291 --> 00:34:04,651
Rym: We watched it like right after it came out and Makoto Shinkai 20 ish minutes long.

677
00:34:04,952 --> 00:34:07,846
Scott: Makoto Shinkai went on to make a whole bunch of other things.

678
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:09,858
Scott: Uh, like five centimeters per second.

679
00:34:09,878 --> 00:34:10,703
Scott: That was Shinkai, right?

680
00:34:10,764 --> 00:34:10,965
Scott: Yeah.

681
00:34:11,246 --> 00:34:11,447
Scott: Right.

682
00:34:11,971 --> 00:34:18,284
Rym: Uh, well, he's promised in our early days, children who chase lost voices, which is terrible, which we saw at the New York Comic Con.

683
00:34:18,344 --> 00:34:18,847
Rym: words.

684
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:20,614
Rym: I saw the garden of words.

685
00:34:20,795 --> 00:34:21,820
Scott: I'd haven't seen a garden of words.

686
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:22,523
Scott: I don't think either.

687
00:34:22,824 --> 00:34:24,050
Rym: anime drama film.

688
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:24,371
Rym: What?

689
00:34:24,793 --> 00:34:26,320
Rym: He has a movie he made in 2013.

690
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,828
Rym: I didn't fucking know about me either.

691
00:34:28,331 --> 00:34:39,721
Scott: Uh, the point is Makoto Shinkai, while there's a lot of great things about Makoto Shinkai is not on the level of like, you know, the Satoshi Kans, the Miyazaki's where there's batting out hits.

692
00:34:40,103 --> 00:34:40,605
Scott: Well, right.

693
00:34:40,626 --> 00:34:44,605
Rym: Uh, well, so I would say voices of a distant star because it was his first one.

694
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:45,309
Scott: That's still a hit.

695
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:48,185
Scott: It was a hit because I bet the CG's really dated, but I don't care.

696
00:34:48,205 --> 00:34:50,638
Rym: I've cried a lot at anime before.

697
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:53,695
Rym: Like that one works every time, but voices of a distant star.

698
00:34:53,715 --> 00:34:54,620
Rym: That's a cult 45 anime.

699
00:34:54,980 --> 00:35:00,005
Rym: Like I edged into ugly crying and I get a little choked up if I think about that movie too much.

700
00:35:00,146 --> 00:35:02,157
Scott: And it's only like five minutes long.

701
00:35:02,157 --> 00:35:02,720
Rym: 25 minutes long.

702
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,046
Scott: Oh, it's longer than I thought.

703
00:35:04,347 --> 00:35:14,249
Rym: But it was also like it perfectly distilled the genre that I would describe as lovers separated by space and time with clouds in the background.

704
00:35:14,269 --> 00:35:15,095
Scott: Well, they didn't have clouds.

705
00:35:15,116 --> 00:35:15,579
Rym: Yeah, they did.

706
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:16,304
Rym: Yeah, they did.

707
00:35:16,324 --> 00:35:18,318
Scott: You don't remember when he was on earth, there were clouds.

708
00:35:18,379 --> 00:35:22,198
Rym: No, also her, the background when she's in the ship is cloud coming down.

709
00:35:22,278 --> 00:35:22,480
Rym: Yeah.

710
00:35:22,881 --> 00:35:25,114
Rym: Anyway, the point is we should watch it again and cry.

711
00:35:25,255 --> 00:35:26,904
Scott: Shinkai specialty, right?

712
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:33,090
Rym: It's over separated the space and time and is the lover separate space and time storyline and the cloud.

713
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:37,004
Scott: environmental, you know, not necessarily the animation.

714
00:35:37,044 --> 00:35:38,070
Scott: It's not about the movement.

715
00:35:38,191 --> 00:35:41,528
Scott: It's just about how it looks like even still, right?

716
00:35:41,548 --> 00:35:51,006
Scott: They're like, you can see like TV commercials animated by Shinkai and it's just like the unbelievable sky that he draws or gets his team to draw.

717
00:35:51,027 --> 00:35:53,340
Rym: You see two seconds of and you're like, that's Makoto Shinkai.

718
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:57,422
Scott: It's like you can see a single cloud and be like, that's a Makoto Shinkai cloud.

719
00:35:57,462 --> 00:36:02,606
Scott: The same way that it would be like, you know, uh, you know, that's a Itano circus.

720
00:36:02,626 --> 00:36:03,734
Scott: Look at the way those missiles move.

721
00:36:03,774 --> 00:36:06,753
Scott: I can just tell, I can tell right away that that mech was made by Itano.

722
00:36:06,874 --> 00:36:16,250
Scott: I feel like someday we're going to talk about the Shinkai cloud or like the way that like Shinkai sky, the way to Miyazaki movie, the monster will be kind of like, we'll kind of move in that sort of blobby way.

723
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:25,684
Rym: Like the, you know, the board at the start of, but also in Miyazaki, the way when there's a machine, like a car or a plane, like that way, it sort of vibrates and throws the way like it's about to fall apart.

724
00:36:25,764 --> 00:36:35,492
Rym: or the way a building collapses in a, in a, you know, or the way an hour will come up over a hill and come down while there's someone walking on the road next to anyway.

725
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:36,035
Scott: Right.

726
00:36:36,115 --> 00:36:38,766
Scott: But those are all things that happen animatedly, right?

727
00:36:38,847 --> 00:36:46,098
Scott: Shinkai is just about, it captures the cloud in the sky, mostly the environment, the weather, and is still image.

728
00:36:46,118 --> 00:36:50,259
Scott: So here in a lot of his previous movies, he went hard on the weather, right?

729
00:36:50,319 --> 00:36:51,929
Scott: Your name was, and you know, eventually, right.

730
00:36:51,949 --> 00:36:56,375
Scott: He got to your name, which is the biggest fucking deal in like anime history.

731
00:36:56,475 --> 00:36:58,123
Rym: I also think it is his greatest work.

732
00:36:58,283 --> 00:37:01,155
Rym: Probably your name is a phenomenal movie, right?

733
00:37:02,179 --> 00:37:05,216
Scott: Uh, it's not perfect, but it's, it's not perfect, but it is phenomenal.

734
00:37:05,257 --> 00:37:06,082
Scott: His greatest work.

735
00:37:06,243 --> 00:37:07,735
Rym: Yeah, but I would call it a phenomenal movie.

736
00:37:07,755 --> 00:37:08,601
Rym: I would put it up there.

737
00:37:08,661 --> 00:37:08,983
Rym: It's good.

738
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:12,318
Scott: Uh, so then it's like, follow up to your name.

739
00:37:12,378 --> 00:37:12,780
Scott: Here I go.

740
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,665
Scott: Weathering with you.

741
00:37:13,785 --> 00:37:15,335
Rym: Literally about skies and weather.

742
00:37:15,456 --> 00:37:16,422
Scott: I got to give you credit.

743
00:37:16,884 --> 00:37:18,352
Scott: You know what your thing is.

744
00:37:18,432 --> 00:37:20,342
Scott: It's lover, server, space and time and weather.

745
00:37:20,362 --> 00:37:23,092
Scott: You're just going all in and weathering with you.

746
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:25,682
Scott: W E A T H. I'm not backing.

747
00:37:25,762 --> 00:37:26,646
Rym: I know who I am.

748
00:37:26,666 --> 00:37:27,691
Scott: I'm a koto Shinkai.

749
00:37:27,932 --> 00:37:28,816
Scott: This is what I do.

750
00:37:29,097 --> 00:37:30,223
Scott: Watch me do it more.

751
00:37:30,323 --> 00:37:36,858
Scott: I'm not going to, I'm not going to try to do something different or try to show people that I'm, that I have skills that I can vary my game.

752
00:37:36,878 --> 00:37:39,630
Scott: I'm just going to master my one thing.

753
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:43,750
Scott: The way it's a very Joe, a guy, Richie mastered a certain kind of movie.

754
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:45,358
Scott: I think it's a very Japanese thing.

755
00:37:45,459 --> 00:37:46,765
Scott: Also, like I'm the sushi chef.

756
00:37:46,845 --> 00:37:48,595
Scott: I master the sushi, right?

757
00:37:48,836 --> 00:37:51,089
Scott: It's like a thing where the, you know, they hone, they're all.

758
00:37:51,109 --> 00:37:53,844
Scott: of course, there is a long history of honing craft.

759
00:37:53,924 --> 00:38:00,490
Rym: There is one deviation because children who chase lost voices felt like an air Satsumi, a sake movie.

760
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:02,861
Rym: Yes, but it didn't feel like the rest of them.

761
00:38:02,921 --> 00:38:05,513
Rym: It just felt empty and broken.

762
00:38:05,573 --> 00:38:06,537
Scott: I hardly remember anything.

763
00:38:06,557 --> 00:38:08,650
Scott: I just remember that it was really boring.

764
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:09,637
Scott: And I understand what's going on.

765
00:38:09,657 --> 00:38:14,627
Rym: I'm pretty sure we reviewed, I'm pretty sure we reviewed almost the U S premiere at the New York comic con.

766
00:38:14,747 --> 00:38:20,575
Scott: And then we saw an interview and he was there in person, but yeah, I don't remember the movie was no good.

767
00:38:21,037 --> 00:38:21,880
Rym: Air Satsumi, a sake.

768
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:30,759
Scott: I'm telling you the point is, uh, weathering with you came to the U S and not only is it think still in theaters and places it's popular.

769
00:38:30,779 --> 00:38:33,315
Scott: It's doing really well mostly because of the success of your name.

770
00:38:33,375 --> 00:38:36,149
Scott: weathering with you got, you know, got to have a bigger run.

771
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:39,381
Scott: They're also showing it in four DX, right?

772
00:38:39,402 --> 00:38:40,266
Scott: So I don't know if people know.

773
00:38:40,327 --> 00:38:43,543
Scott: this four DX is basically amusement park theater.

774
00:38:43,744 --> 00:38:47,621
Scott: You sit in like a seat that moves and like they spray water on you.

775
00:38:47,681 --> 00:38:48,465
Scott: It's like fucking honey.

776
00:38:48,525 --> 00:38:56,263
Scott: I shrunk the kids or, you know, Terminator with the 3d glasses where, you know, seats are moving and they're, they're blowing air on you.

777
00:38:56,404 --> 00:38:57,770
Scott: So it's a movie about weather.

778
00:38:58,092 --> 00:39:14,179
Scott: So I presume that if you go see this in 40 X, which I did not, that they would like spray you during, you know, water scenes or shoot you with that gun, shake you during chase scenes or jolt you during, you know, gunfire firing scenes, fucking gun.

779
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:16,329
Scott: So if you want to go see it that way, be my guest.

780
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:21,597
Scott: I've heard mixed opinions on how that is, but I just saw it in the normal theater, the normal way.

781
00:39:21,737 --> 00:39:23,969
Rym: Now it's also like it won four Annie awards.

782
00:39:24,532 --> 00:39:25,598
Rym: Uh, it is the, it's not like.

783
00:39:25,618 --> 00:39:28,916
Scott: there's a lot of competition this year, including best independent animated feature.

784
00:39:28,936 --> 00:39:36,151
Rym: It's the third anime film tying spirited away and millennium actress to have four nominations, highest anime film in the antes.

785
00:39:36,372 --> 00:39:36,935
Rym: Yep.

786
00:39:36,975 --> 00:39:37,679
Rym: Bunch of stuff here.

787
00:39:37,719 --> 00:39:40,999
Rym: You can read the Wikipedia and like news articles about all those details.

788
00:39:41,019 --> 00:39:42,450
Scott: So I think, you know, he followed up your name.

789
00:39:42,471 --> 00:39:45,330
Scott: I don't think it's as good as your name, but let's talk about what it is.

790
00:39:45,451 --> 00:39:46,899
Rym: So we won't spoil anything yet.

791
00:39:46,939 --> 00:39:52,465
Rym: Cause just what we will talk, we will shift into spoilers so we can talk about, I don't think you need to spoil that much.

792
00:39:52,686 --> 00:39:59,475
Rym: Yeah, but I want to, I don't like some of the readings of like how you can interpret this movie.

793
00:39:59,555 --> 00:39:59,857
Rym: Oh yeah.

794
00:40:00,098 --> 00:40:14,284
Rym: I feel like it's, I don't know if it was, if some of the readings are intentional, I'm worried about his opinions on things and if they're unintentional, then they were poorly, uh, not proper care was not taken, but I would not send an incorrect message.

795
00:40:14,325 --> 00:40:17,140
Rym: But the things I will say are one, it is utterly beautiful.

796
00:40:17,761 --> 00:40:19,067
Rym: Like the animation is superb.

797
00:40:19,087 --> 00:40:20,293
Rym: It looks great.

798
00:40:20,413 --> 00:40:27,202
Scott: It looks like, you know, as, as good as end or better than your name, you know, and he brings up the hallmark cloud.

799
00:40:27,222 --> 00:40:28,105
Scott: It's like, you still got it.

800
00:40:28,326 --> 00:40:31,318
Rym: It is, it is very funny at many moments.

801
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,754
Rym: Like it is a funny movie, but also serious.

802
00:40:34,774 --> 00:40:34,895
Scott: Yeah.

803
00:40:34,915 --> 00:40:43,303
Scott: There was definitely, I think more comedy than your name because there were the side characters had more screen time.

804
00:40:43,906 --> 00:40:49,556
Scott: And this, I do like the fact that, you know, a lot of times there'll be animes where you have a side character, right?

805
00:40:49,656 --> 00:40:53,035
Scott: And the side character is way cool, but you hardly see them at all.

806
00:40:53,055 --> 00:40:54,341
Scott: They don't get a lot of time, right?

807
00:40:54,361 --> 00:41:03,017
Scott: So for example, Promare had lots of cool side characters, like a whole bunch of them, but individually, any one of them barely got enough play.

808
00:41:03,037 --> 00:41:03,098
Scott: Yep.

809
00:41:03,339 --> 00:41:07,539
Scott: So even though that Robo has that problem, they had their cool scene, right?

810
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:08,644
Scott: And then that was sort of it.

811
00:41:08,664 --> 00:41:14,209
Scott: Like, think about say a Promare, uh, adjacent, uh, story tank police, right?

812
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:16,663
Scott: There's the chief who's bad-ass and awesome and hilarious.

813
00:41:17,065 --> 00:41:19,178
Scott: And the chief has like a couple of scenes, right?

814
00:41:19,218 --> 00:41:20,082
Rym: And I would watch that.

815
00:41:20,825 --> 00:41:24,078
Rym: You can tell it's a show like that or a movie like that.

816
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:32,274
Rym: If you would legitimately be excited, if someone named any character from that show and said, they're getting a spinoff movie just about them, right?

817
00:41:32,314 --> 00:41:39,912
Scott: So here it's more of a cowboy bebop situation where the side characters, you know, Ed Ein, whatever, there's not too many of them, right?

818
00:41:40,033 --> 00:41:42,184
Scott: And they get plenty of screen time each.

819
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:50,001
Scott: And therefore the more humorous side characters continually bring their humor more throughout the movie and they're present throughout the movie.

820
00:41:50,021 --> 00:41:51,811
Scott: They're not like, you know, your name.

821
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:53,984
Scott: I felt like they were more present.

822
00:41:54,246 --> 00:41:54,729
Scott: I don't remember.

823
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:55,495
Scott: I only saw it once.

824
00:41:55,555 --> 00:42:00,882
Scott: I don't remember a hundred percent of it, but I felt like those side characters were present earlier in the movie.

825
00:42:00,922 --> 00:42:03,918
Scott: And then towards the end and climax were left in the town.

826
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:06,575
Scott: Well, yeah, because the main characters left the scene.

827
00:42:06,595 --> 00:42:11,082
Rym: Well, cause they sort of bookended the, cause the main journey of the movie was just the two main characters.

828
00:42:11,142 --> 00:42:11,665
Scott: Exactly.

829
00:42:11,705 --> 00:42:19,687
Scott: Whereas here in weathering with you, those side characters are there throughout, like they don't disappear even like up to the last second.

830
00:42:19,949 --> 00:42:24,131
Scott: You're not like escaping the funny part and going just with the main characters who aren't humorous.

831
00:42:24,553 --> 00:42:27,247
Scott: And also the main characters had some humor in themselves.

832
00:42:27,549 --> 00:42:31,366
Scott: They weren't purely just, you know, the romance, even though they were.

833
00:42:31,809 --> 00:42:38,881
Rym: So the vague plot is this young boy runs away from home for reasons that are not explained and tries to make it in the city.

834
00:42:40,126 --> 00:42:41,591
Scott: He lives on an island.

835
00:42:41,631 --> 00:42:44,624
Scott: So he had to take a boat to go to Tokyo right?

836
00:42:44,644 --> 00:42:47,037
Scott: So I guess he lived on, what's the Southern island in Japan?

837
00:42:47,077 --> 00:42:47,439
Scott: The big one.

838
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:50,634
Rym: Well, you're talking about the main Japanese islands.

839
00:42:50,694 --> 00:42:50,956
Scott: No, no.

840
00:42:50,997 --> 00:42:51,883
Scott: What does the main one?

841
00:42:51,923 --> 00:42:53,836
Scott: And then the big fat one that's underneath.

842
00:42:53,916 --> 00:42:56,086
Scott: I'm pretty sure he came from the big, what?

843
00:42:57,271 --> 00:42:57,773
Scott: Chikoku.

844
00:42:58,094 --> 00:42:59,580
Scott: Oh, the one that's like, sounds like hell.

845
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,644
Rym: Chikoku.

846
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:03,647
Rym: Right there.

847
00:43:03,687 --> 00:43:04,028
Rym: That one.

848
00:43:04,129 --> 00:43:04,932
Rym: Yeah.

849
00:43:05,092 --> 00:43:08,265
Scott: He's from not the same island that Tokyo is on.

850
00:43:08,386 --> 00:43:10,297
Scott: And so we had to take a boat to go to Tokyo.

851
00:43:10,318 --> 00:43:11,626
Scott: and that's sort of how the movie opens.

852
00:43:11,928 --> 00:43:12,170
Rym: Yep.

853
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:14,344
Rym: And he's like clearly like running away from home.

854
00:43:14,385 --> 00:43:18,649
Rym: Like it's not clear if he's abused, like what's going on, but he's no real explanation for why.

855
00:43:18,669 --> 00:43:28,071
Scott: If kid is running away from home to make a life in Tokyo and is not a legal adult in any way, definitely a high school student who is not going to high school.

856
00:43:28,151 --> 00:43:32,553
Rym: And this is a movie that is set in modern times with cell phones and cameras and things.

857
00:43:32,634 --> 00:43:35,064
Rym: So like he can't just get a job.

858
00:43:35,485 --> 00:43:40,988
Rym: Like he ends up having to work illegally for someone and like kind of just live in his office.

859
00:43:41,189 --> 00:43:41,430
Scott: Yep.

860
00:43:41,892 --> 00:43:43,780
Scott: And it seems like the dude is shady.

861
00:43:43,881 --> 00:43:47,484
Scott: Like you think it's going to be a Yakuza situation, but no, the dude is actually okay.

862
00:43:47,504 --> 00:43:47,665
Rym: Yep.

863
00:43:48,087 --> 00:43:51,807
Scott: Even though the business they're in is not like, it's not an illegitimate business.

864
00:43:51,867 --> 00:43:53,577
Scott: It's just not like a great business.

865
00:43:53,617 --> 00:43:53,818
Scott: Yep.

866
00:43:54,019 --> 00:43:55,224
Rym: It's basically a tabloid.

867
00:43:55,245 --> 00:43:55,666
Rym: Yeah.

868
00:43:55,867 --> 00:43:59,544
Rym: Like a, but it seems to actually world news level tabloid.

869
00:43:59,584 --> 00:44:00,933
Scott: It seems to actually make some money.

870
00:44:00,953 --> 00:44:03,147
Scott: It actually doesn't seem like they make their own tabloid.

871
00:44:03,188 --> 00:44:06,526
Scott: It seems more like they're contracted to make content for other tabloids.

872
00:44:07,169 --> 00:44:08,595
Scott: Anyway, it doesn't matter.

873
00:44:08,917 --> 00:44:10,222
Rym: And you know, things happen.

874
00:44:10,343 --> 00:44:11,568
Rym: It's just moderately long.

875
00:44:11,588 --> 00:44:11,990
Rym: It was 112 minutes.

876
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:17,933
Rym: And he ends up meeting this girl who is kind of like a weather witch, right?

877
00:44:17,973 --> 00:44:23,854
Scott: So the thing is, as you're watching the movie, it's basically always raining.

878
00:44:24,015 --> 00:44:26,484
Scott: It's set always, it is heavily implied.

879
00:44:26,524 --> 00:44:31,447
Rym: It's set during an era of extreme climate change that is slowly flooding Japan, right?

880
00:44:31,587 --> 00:44:41,468
Scott: In the same way that when you watch Evangelion, it's eternal summer and you sorta like it, you know, it's not pointed out to you so strongly here.

881
00:44:41,548 --> 00:44:46,466
Scott: It's pointed out more strongly than an Evangelion, but it's like, yeah, it's always raining.

882
00:44:46,888 --> 00:44:50,438
Scott: It's almost never not raining.

883
00:44:50,598 --> 00:44:54,798
Rym: Sunshine is rare to the point that if the sun comes out, like people freak out.

884
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:55,179
Scott: Yeah.

885
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,165
Scott: It's like, Oh, the sun is out.

886
00:44:56,205 --> 00:44:56,467
Scott: Yes.

887
00:44:56,929 --> 00:44:57,331
Scott: Finally.

888
00:44:57,372 --> 00:44:58,518
Scott: There's a brief moment of sun.

889
00:44:58,599 --> 00:44:58,760
Scott: Yes.

890
00:44:59,041 --> 00:44:59,362
Scott: Right.

891
00:45:00,045 --> 00:45:02,697
Scott: It's not like unusual that people haven't forgotten the sun.

892
00:45:02,717 --> 00:45:08,563
Scott: It's just sort of like, yeah, it started raining a while ago and it really hasn't stopped in a long time.

893
00:45:08,604 --> 00:45:12,660
Scott: And if it's not raining, it's still gray and drizzly and meh.

894
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:18,462
Rym: This is so pervasive and such an integral part of like the theme and everything about the movie.

895
00:45:18,502 --> 00:45:29,048
Scott: But also it gives them a chance to flex his cloud because the strong visual contrast between the constant gloominess and all right, I'm going to put a meaningful scene.

896
00:45:29,088 --> 00:45:33,591
Scott: I can just open up the clouds and get boom, instant contrast, visually instant meaning.

897
00:45:33,671 --> 00:45:34,896
Scott: And it's so easy.

898
00:45:35,317 --> 00:45:41,056
Scott: And to do and he's making like that plot and that visual motif.

899
00:45:41,537 --> 00:45:43,243
Scott: Also, the thing that he is the best at.

900
00:45:43,544 --> 00:45:43,825
Scott: Right.

901
00:45:43,986 --> 00:45:44,889
Scott: All in one go.

902
00:45:44,990 --> 00:45:46,556
Scott: It's like, aha, I have craft.

903
00:45:46,616 --> 00:45:48,524
Scott: It's like, I'm really good at this thing.

904
00:45:48,866 --> 00:45:53,245
Scott: Let me write a plot that makes being good at that thing really use.

905
00:45:53,325 --> 00:45:54,008
Scott: Right.

906
00:45:54,469 --> 00:45:57,240
Scott: So this girl is like making a sheath to fit your sword.

907
00:45:57,561 --> 00:46:03,510
Rym: So basically this girl he meets, who's a little, it seems to be a little bit older than him and kind of has her like her act together.

908
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:07,286
Scott: She can summon sunlight, right?

909
00:46:07,346 --> 00:46:10,881
Scott: It seems at first, it seems like some sort of, you know, like, can.

910
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:13,753
Scott: she really is a coincidence, but it's like gradually.

911
00:46:13,773 --> 00:46:18,251
Scott: it's like, no, it seems like the rain is actually some sort of angry rain God.

912
00:46:18,753 --> 00:46:30,504
Scott: And she has some sort of spiritual meaning, power, some kind of connection to the, whatever the God based on some ancient thing, like ancient writings and like knowledge that is kind of lost.

913
00:46:30,584 --> 00:46:34,140
Rym: Like there's one old priest who kind of knows the deal, right?

914
00:46:34,301 --> 00:46:38,060
Scott: She can make it, you know, by, by praying and concentrating or whatever.

915
00:46:38,441 --> 00:46:42,455
Scott: She can make it be sunny around her in an area for a period of time.

916
00:46:42,475 --> 00:46:53,790
Rym: And the movie is about all these things and we're going to, we're going to, I'm not going to like explain the plot, but from this point on, I'm going to react to the conclusion to this movie.

917
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:57,761
Rym: So if you haven't seen it and you don't want anything to be spoiled, you should probably stop listening now and come back.

918
00:46:58,263 --> 00:46:58,384
Scott: Yeah.

919
00:46:58,404 --> 00:47:02,380
Scott: But the conclusion you should draw, uh, is that you go see it.

920
00:47:02,601 --> 00:47:03,082
Rym: It's okay.

921
00:47:03,163 --> 00:47:08,062
Scott: Don't expect it to be like the best thing you've ever seen, but it ain't bad.

922
00:47:08,123 --> 00:47:15,154
Rym: And it's worth going to the theater, but I am bothered by some of the apparent morals and themes of this movie.

923
00:47:15,315 --> 00:47:15,536
Rym: Yeah.

924
00:47:15,656 --> 00:47:15,917
Scott: All right.

925
00:47:15,938 --> 00:47:18,269
Scott: So what are the morals and themes of this movie that bother us?

926
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:27,641
Rym: So on one hand, I mean the plot and again, spoilers once you find out that that girl who seems so together is actually like really young and like kind of in the same boat as the kid.

927
00:47:28,485 --> 00:47:30,373
Scott: And well, she didn't run away.

928
00:47:30,453 --> 00:47:31,216
Scott: Her parents died.

929
00:47:31,236 --> 00:47:31,638
Scott: Yep.

930
00:47:31,718 --> 00:47:34,674
Scott: But then she tried to make it on her own without the authorities.

931
00:47:34,714 --> 00:47:42,252
Rym: Cause they, they would separate her from her brother, but he like doesn't have his act together and has all this baggage that's out in front.

932
00:47:42,312 --> 00:47:45,229
Rym: And he sees her as very competent and stable relative to him.

933
00:47:45,289 --> 00:47:45,410
Scott: Right.

934
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:50,275
Scott: Well, cause she's taken care of a brother, like sort of does have some shit together, but it did.

935
00:47:50,356 --> 00:47:59,745
Rym: The big reveal is that she has her own like equivalent level of baggage and the two of them together, you know, the, the title weathering with you or weathering you want to get argue.

936
00:47:59,765 --> 00:48:04,612
Rym: There is a reading that this is about the way relationships form and how people bring baggage together.

937
00:48:04,632 --> 00:48:08,552
Rym: And you almost have to weather each other and then together weather the world.

938
00:48:08,572 --> 00:48:11,607
Rym: And like that feels like a very Magoto Shinkai kind of reading.

939
00:48:11,748 --> 00:48:11,969
Rym: Yep.

940
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:19,636
Rym: And I feel like that is one of the primary readings of this, but it's set in an era of climate change.

941
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:27,026
Scott: And if this came out, even 10 years ago, you would never do the climate change reading of this right ever.

942
00:48:27,348 --> 00:48:41,037
Rym: But, but because it comes out in 2020, you have to, and it seems to make this point that young people like her who have this power can work hard and sort of sacrifice themselves to make the rain go away.

943
00:48:41,057 --> 00:48:46,740
Rym: But the moral of the movie almost seems to be children should not try to do that.

944
00:48:46,981 --> 00:48:49,291
Rym: Don't throw your life away trying to save the world.

945
00:48:49,612 --> 00:48:52,042
Rym: Just whether the world that will come.

946
00:48:52,083 --> 00:48:53,971
Rym: your children, it's not your fault, right?

947
00:48:54,051 --> 00:48:56,661
Scott: So basically give up, right?

948
00:48:57,203 --> 00:49:07,607
Scott: So what they're trying to do is they make this illusion that, yeah, way back in the ancient times, they would like sacrifice the local witch, you know, to the gods to appease them.

949
00:49:07,989 --> 00:49:10,038
Scott: And that would make the rain go away, right?

950
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:13,802
Scott: But they haven't done that in a long time because, uh, we don't do that shit anymore.

951
00:49:14,565 --> 00:49:16,494
Scott: And she just happens to be the weather witch.

952
00:49:16,795 --> 00:49:28,604
Rym: So they could sacrifice her to the god and make it the sun come back in the same way that the youth of the world could sacrifice their childhood to like actively fight for climate reform.

953
00:49:28,684 --> 00:49:28,966
Rym: Right.

954
00:49:29,569 --> 00:49:39,207
Scott: Uh, and then in the end, the dude, the main character dude chooses to not have his love separated by space and time and bring her back and make it rain forever.

955
00:49:39,227 --> 00:49:47,783
Scott: And then what they illustrate is a world where the rain continues nonstop pretty much and Japan like starts getting destroyed.

956
00:49:48,044 --> 00:49:52,663
Scott: Like Tokyo is like sinking, like a lot of it, like, you know, Akira situation.

957
00:49:52,945 --> 00:49:54,492
Rym: fast forward time skips to the future.

958
00:49:54,512 --> 00:50:00,018
Rym: He, they come back together a few years later, like the world is approaching ruin, right?

959
00:50:00,058 --> 00:50:00,883
Scott: The world is approaching.

960
00:50:00,903 --> 00:50:04,143
Scott: Like you look and they show you a picture of like most of Tokyo underwater.

961
00:50:04,163 --> 00:50:09,407
Scott: And then they show you people like adapting to it and just getting along just fine.

962
00:50:09,428 --> 00:50:15,099
Scott: The dude who was in a tabloid office underneath the building is now in a much better office because he also grew up.

963
00:50:15,159 --> 00:50:17,778
Rym: I'll get to that third reading about like growing up, which is also there.

964
00:50:17,818 --> 00:50:19,468
Scott: He got his family back together.

965
00:50:19,548 --> 00:50:20,232
Scott: It's like, okay.

966
00:50:20,272 --> 00:50:22,103
Scott: He finished high school, he got it done.

967
00:50:22,123 --> 00:50:25,098
Scott: And then he went back to Tokyo and met the girl again.

968
00:50:25,159 --> 00:50:26,709
Scott: And now they're happy that they're together.

969
00:50:26,749 --> 00:50:29,745
Rym: It's more of like, you can weather the storm, the world will change.

970
00:50:29,886 --> 00:50:31,332
Rym: Just try to adapt to it.

971
00:50:32,055 --> 00:50:32,979
Rym: Fuck that noise.

972
00:50:33,019 --> 00:50:33,260
Rym: Right.

973
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:36,257
Scott: It's like, uh, are you trying to say that the climate check?

974
00:50:36,297 --> 00:50:41,686
Scott: if New York flooded the way Tokyo flooded in that image that you could, we would be able to just deal with it.

975
00:50:41,746 --> 00:50:50,683
Scott: And there wouldn't be a global catastrophe that results in like, you know, riots, global emergency, disease, war, famine, et cetera.

976
00:50:50,803 --> 00:51:01,835
Scott: It definitely portrays the world where people at this, not something you can, like he shows modern Western society continuing and thriving and adapting to a great catastrophe.

977
00:51:01,895 --> 00:51:04,024
Scott: It's like, bro, that's not how it's going to go.

978
00:51:04,124 --> 00:51:04,385
Rym: Nope.

979
00:51:04,927 --> 00:51:06,152
Scott: That's not how it's going to be.

980
00:51:07,055 --> 00:51:10,568
Scott: And if Tokyo sinks that much, Japan is boned.

981
00:51:10,789 --> 00:51:13,017
Scott: And my real word is like, no food.

982
00:51:13,037 --> 00:51:21,527
Rym: Like, if you watch this movie, this is not a, like a stretch as a real economic disaster and center.

983
00:51:21,547 --> 00:51:29,991
Scott: Like you could make a video essay about how that is the moral of the Japanese people would like you to, I can, you know, continue even having, you know, anything.

984
00:51:30,333 --> 00:51:37,205
Rym: And they even like the movie gets like, makes this point over and over again that if it's not your fault, it's not your responsibility.

985
00:51:38,269 --> 00:51:45,607
Rym: And the reality is for young people in the world today, yes, it's not your fault, but it kind of is going to be your responsibility because old people failed.

986
00:51:45,648 --> 00:52:01,962
Scott: Well, it also portrays the right by using, you know, the, uh, the story of, you know, the ancient story of like, oh, God's making the weather sacrifice to the, you know, your, your weather, which to them to appease them, portrays the climate change as not your fault.

987
00:52:02,042 --> 00:52:10,570
Scott: And as a natural thing, as a God thing, as opposed to a thing that was caused by the people, right?

988
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:12,238
Scott: They caused the bad weather.

989
00:52:12,338 --> 00:52:16,077
Scott: It's not the people aren't sacrificing to get rid of the bad weather.

990
00:52:16,098 --> 00:52:17,766
Scott: They made the bad weather in a nice place.

991
00:52:17,947 --> 00:52:20,199
Scott: And the sacrifice is not a natural thing.

992
00:52:20,219 --> 00:52:26,110
Rym: The sacrifice as portrayed is not really like sacrifice people to our God.

993
00:52:26,231 --> 00:52:33,652
Rym: It's a third reading that is probably good.

994
00:52:33,712 --> 00:52:46,272
Rym: before I get into the last thing that annoys me about the movie, which is the gun, the gun bothers, the gun would have been fine if they didn't use it multiple times and it didn't drive the plot forward twice by being fired.

995
00:52:46,614 --> 00:52:46,794
Scott: Right.

996
00:52:46,815 --> 00:52:56,800
Scott: It seems like the lower level, the lower level things in the movie, like the character lines and those stories, like about the, the, the niece of the, the business guy, right.

997
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:05,444
Scott: And like the business guy himself getting his, you know, his divorce and his child custody situation, all those things, those things I think are all good story.

998
00:53:05,484 --> 00:53:10,672
Rym: Cause they get back to that first thing about weathering with you or weathering you like weather the world together.

999
00:53:10,692 --> 00:53:13,929
Rym: together, you can weather catastrophe better than separated.

1000
00:53:14,451 --> 00:53:23,631
Rym: Although there's a lot going on there, but it also has this reading of like, the kid doesn't want to give up on whatever his dreams were and why he ran away.

1001
00:53:23,651 --> 00:53:29,540
Rym: The moral was sort of suck it up, go back and live the life you hate to become an adult and be responsible.

1002
00:53:30,321 --> 00:53:38,779
Rym: And it lays that template out for literally every character we're introduced to of suck it up, be an adult and join normal society.

1003
00:53:38,839 --> 00:53:45,660
Scott: And this coming from someone who made, who is, I guess doing, who knows, I forget what his job was at the time, but he made an anime in his basement and got lucky.

1004
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:46,462
Scott: Yeah.

1005
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:47,467
Scott: Also made a good anime.

1006
00:53:47,508 --> 00:53:47,709
Scott: Yup.

1007
00:53:48,452 --> 00:53:51,914
Rym: But it like, we don't know what he was running from, like why he was running away from home.

1008
00:53:51,974 --> 00:53:53,505
Rym: It's easy to see that he might've been abused.

1009
00:53:53,525 --> 00:53:59,277
Scott: Like there's something up with, they never say why he ran away from home, but there was no indication of abuse.

1010
00:53:59,297 --> 00:54:00,785
Scott: They never show you his parents.

1011
00:54:00,886 --> 00:54:02,497
Scott: You don't know if he has siblings or anything.

1012
00:54:02,718 --> 00:54:11,556
Rym: But they definitely imply when he goes back home, like, and then there's the time skip at the end of the movie, that he was miserable there and counted the seconds until he could leave and he just sucked it up.

1013
00:54:11,576 --> 00:54:13,287
Rym: And then you get the cool guy who ran the tabloid.

1014
00:54:13,649 --> 00:54:17,108
Rym: And now he's like a normal stuffy businessman because that was the right thing to do.

1015
00:54:18,173 --> 00:54:19,801
Rym: And everyone like became a normal adult.

1016
00:54:19,861 --> 00:54:22,236
Scott: It helped him get his, you know, time with his kid again.

1017
00:54:22,256 --> 00:54:22,497
Scott: Yup.

1018
00:54:22,517 --> 00:54:22,719
Rym: Right.

1019
00:54:23,041 --> 00:54:32,128
Scott: Because, you know, if you're a dude who lives in a basement, it's harder to convince the, you know, them to let you see your child than if you are a successful business person.

1020
00:54:32,289 --> 00:54:48,272
Rym: But at the same time, that could almost be more an indictment of society's expectations, but the movie portrays it more as suck it up and join society as it is, which leads back into another bad interpretation that it almost has this undercurrent of.

1021
00:54:48,774 --> 00:54:56,464
Rym: you've got to not like stand out or buck the system so that you can have harmony together to weather the world around you.

1022
00:54:57,489 --> 00:55:06,083
Scott: And I don't, I think is, you know, it's, and that's the thing is that lesson is fine in some contexts, but not in the context of a global catastrophe.

1023
00:55:06,143 --> 00:55:06,465
Scott: Yeah.

1024
00:55:06,605 --> 00:55:06,886
Scott: Right.

1025
00:55:07,087 --> 00:55:12,608
Scott: So the, the show, the, the putting them both together like that is the real problem.

1026
00:55:13,029 --> 00:55:17,805
Scott: If it was something else besides climate change that you showed, right.

1027
00:55:17,905 --> 00:55:19,491
Scott: It could have worked, right.

1028
00:55:19,772 --> 00:55:22,080
Scott: But not climate change.

1029
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,654
Rym: And they almost could have gotten away with this.

1030
00:55:24,694 --> 00:55:28,576
Rym: Like the movie could have gotten away with it, except that it portrays a sunken and ruined Tokyo.

1031
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:30,004
Rym: And yet everyone's just totally fine.

1032
00:55:30,184 --> 00:55:30,386
Scott: Right.

1033
00:55:30,406 --> 00:55:31,552
Scott: It's like people have adapted.

1034
00:55:31,592 --> 00:55:35,130
Scott: They're using boats and they're wearing long boots.

1035
00:55:35,171 --> 00:55:36,658
Scott: They got their umbrellas out all the time.

1036
00:55:36,698 --> 00:55:37,803
Scott: They're just, they're dealing with it.

1037
00:55:38,446 --> 00:55:39,310
Scott: Life is going on.

1038
00:55:39,350 --> 00:55:40,797
Scott: The economy's not ruined.

1039
00:55:41,139 --> 00:55:42,926
Scott: Somehow everyone still has food.

1040
00:55:43,007 --> 00:55:45,497
Scott: Somehow the electricity still works.

1041
00:55:45,819 --> 00:55:49,759
Scott: All these giant buildings and entire neighborhoods of downtown are completely underwater.

1042
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:55,546
Rym: If the ocean like rises too much, New York, isn't just going to be a bunch of canals among skyscrapers.

1043
00:55:55,606 --> 00:55:57,395
Rym: It's going to be on fire and abandoned.

1044
00:55:57,777 --> 00:55:57,998
Scott: Yeah.

1045
00:55:58,299 --> 00:56:01,231
Scott: It's going to be fucking like escape from New York, but no, for real.

1046
00:56:01,894 --> 00:56:03,220
Scott: So not a joke.

1047
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,988
Rym: The gun on one hand.

1048
00:56:06,008 --> 00:56:10,564
Scott: So a gun is a big deal in any Japanese movie, except maybe a Yakuza movie.

1049
00:56:10,584 --> 00:56:17,975
Rym: But even then, like even in Yakuza, because like that old, that old movie, which we love, like nobody has guns.

1050
00:56:18,055 --> 00:56:21,432
Scott: And at one point, the cops have to go get their guns from the special place.

1051
00:56:21,452 --> 00:56:30,254
Rym: Like there's a big plot point where a crazy dude has a gun and no cops have a gun and they got to go get permission to get their guns out, but they don't.

1052
00:56:30,294 --> 00:56:31,844
Rym: They just talk the guy down and take his gun away.

1053
00:56:32,005 --> 00:56:32,226
Rym: Yeah.

1054
00:56:32,307 --> 00:56:34,197
Scott: And like knives are a big deal, right?

1055
00:56:34,358 --> 00:56:37,370
Scott: Like in Japan, any Japanese thing, guns are a big deal.

1056
00:56:37,993 --> 00:56:44,180
Scott: Uh, and this movie early on, the kid finds a gun in a trash can outside of a strip club or a whorehouse.

1057
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:44,521
Rym: Right.

1058
00:56:44,541 --> 00:56:46,996
Scott: And it's basically what some Yakuza guy dumped it there.

1059
00:56:47,016 --> 00:56:47,559
Scott: Right.

1060
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:51,435
Scott: And the kid by random chance finds it and has it.

1061
00:56:51,656 --> 00:56:53,805
Rym: But right then he basically gets attacked by a pimp.

1062
00:56:54,227 --> 00:57:01,118
Rym: And because he has this gun, he pulls it out and shoots at the pimp at the end of the air, which scares the pimp away.

1063
00:57:01,138 --> 00:57:01,379
Rym: Right.

1064
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:04,494
Scott: And that's, and then he, you know, fine.

1065
00:57:04,534 --> 00:57:05,539
Rym: That drives some of the plot.

1066
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:08,562
Rym: Now there's a reason for the police to be looking for him, which escalates the attention.

1067
00:57:08,703 --> 00:57:10,614
Scott: Like he abandons the gun in this building.

1068
00:57:10,775 --> 00:57:10,976
Scott: Yep.

1069
00:57:10,996 --> 00:57:11,982
Rym: Like he leaves it somewhere.

1070
00:57:12,022 --> 00:57:14,840
Scott: And the building is sort of like the central building in the movie.

1071
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:17,473
Scott: It reminds me of the building in the matrix that they go back.

1072
00:57:17,554 --> 00:57:18,117
Scott: Yeah.

1073
00:57:18,479 --> 00:57:19,807
Rym: I got that same impression.

1074
00:57:19,988 --> 00:57:22,202
Scott: Uh, the, what are the heart of the city hotel in the matrix?

1075
00:57:22,383 --> 00:57:25,116
Scott: Like he going back to that same place, right?

1076
00:57:25,156 --> 00:57:26,020
Scott: This is that same thing.

1077
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:30,829
Scott: There's a building with a little shrine to the weather God on the roof, but also it's an abandoned building.

1078
00:57:30,849 --> 00:57:32,941
Rym: It looks like it was ruined by the flooding, right?

1079
00:57:32,981 --> 00:57:35,454
Scott: It's the plot place and they keep going back to it.

1080
00:57:35,494 --> 00:57:35,635
Scott: Right.

1081
00:57:35,655 --> 00:57:40,035
Scott: So the gun is at the, you know, an early scene, he abandons the gun there.

1082
00:57:40,055 --> 00:57:46,544
Scott: And then very late in the movie, he's being chased after by the cops who think he has the gun when he doesn't.

1083
00:57:46,906 --> 00:57:47,168
Scott: Right.

1084
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:50,443
Scott: And then they chase him to the place cause that's where he's going.

1085
00:57:50,463 --> 00:57:52,251
Scott: And he picks up the gun while he's there.

1086
00:57:52,652 --> 00:58:01,569
Rym: And he is able to save his lover separated by space and time, avoid the police and like solve everything by firing the gun in the air again.

1087
00:58:01,689 --> 00:58:01,950
Scott: Yes.

1088
00:58:02,031 --> 00:58:17,208
Rym: So the gun was a positive plot moving device that was required by this child's twice to assert authority on the world, which is a weird message to we, like, I don't know what message that gun was intended to portray.

1089
00:58:17,228 --> 00:58:17,931
Scott: Yeah.

1090
00:58:17,991 --> 00:58:18,453
Rym: I don't know.

1091
00:58:18,835 --> 00:58:23,359
Rym: Like the kid gets to wield the authority of an adult twice and it saves them both times.

1092
00:58:23,379 --> 00:58:25,028
Scott: I mean, you can positive both times.

1093
00:58:25,048 --> 00:58:26,797
Scott: You can see this connection, right?

1094
00:58:26,837 --> 00:58:32,904
Scott: You can see the impact of a gun in a, in a Japanese setting and a Japanese movie to a Japanese audience.

1095
00:58:32,924 --> 00:58:33,528
Rym: And it's awesome.

1096
00:58:33,569 --> 00:58:34,556
Rym: It saves his life.

1097
00:58:34,576 --> 00:58:34,737
Scott: Right.

1098
00:58:34,777 --> 00:58:43,659
Scott: You can see that the impact of the scene, you can, you can line both scenes up together and see how they're similar, but I can't understand like what the meaning is.

1099
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:44,222
Scott: Yeah.

1100
00:58:44,503 --> 00:58:48,483
Scott: Because if the meaning is, you could have done something else in a chase scene.

1101
00:58:48,623 --> 00:58:55,051
Scott: or if the meaning gauges back into like, you can't have something with that big an impact that has no meaning.

1102
00:58:55,231 --> 00:59:06,831
Rym: Like shoujo kakame Utena kind of gets into that with the idea of like adults have a power to wield over the world that children don't, but children can sometimes acquire the tools of adults and wield that power in a local context.

1103
00:59:06,851 --> 00:59:08,662
Rym: Like there's a, there's a way to look into this.

1104
00:59:09,285 --> 00:59:15,392
Rym: And this movie could have been saying that that child needed that power of like being an adult or being in society.

1105
00:59:15,432 --> 00:59:20,040
Rym: And the gun was a vehicle to wield that before he was ready or before society would give it to him.

1106
00:59:20,421 --> 00:59:28,233
Rym: But at the same time, wielding a gun in Japanese society is extremely transgressive and thus ruins that entire reading of it kind of.

1107
00:59:28,414 --> 00:59:36,576
Scott: also, uh, you know, most of the things that happen in the movie besides the supernatural weather control are completely realistic and modern, right?

1108
00:59:36,597 --> 00:59:39,571
Scott: The way they use the internet to get jobs, right?

1109
00:59:39,692 --> 00:59:42,486
Rym: The way the hotels won't rent a room to them because exactly.

1110
00:59:42,506 --> 00:59:45,882
Scott: And everything is super believable for a modern time, which is great to see.

1111
00:59:46,685 --> 00:59:56,975
Scott: Uh, except for the fact that like, bro, if you had that gun and shoot it in the air, when there's cops right in front of you, they're not like sending you back home so you can finish high school.

1112
00:59:56,995 --> 00:59:57,658
Rym: They kind of do.

1113
00:59:57,799 --> 00:59:58,582
Scott: So right.

1114
00:59:58,903 --> 01:00:07,978
Scott: You would be, I'm pretty sure you would be in jail, uh, for a long ass time because the Japanese justice system is, uh, not just right.

1115
01:00:08,039 --> 01:00:11,397
Rym: Not, not saying the U S one is no, but in Japan, it's even worse.

1116
01:00:11,417 --> 01:00:13,490
Scott: You're just guilty until proven innocent over there.

1117
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:14,637
Rym: The prosecutor better be right.

1118
01:00:14,798 --> 01:00:17,228
Scott: You know, they make you confess and then they sentence you.

1119
01:00:18,433 --> 01:00:19,196
Scott: Uh, right.

1120
01:00:19,256 --> 01:00:22,148
Scott: So yeah, but even slightly unbelievable.

1121
01:00:22,308 --> 01:00:29,540
Rym: So there's this other undercurrent that there's this unexplored world of the sky that could solve climate change.

1122
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:33,714
Rym: And they prove it's real because the girl disappears up there.

1123
01:00:33,734 --> 01:00:33,794
Rym: Yep.

1124
01:00:33,995 --> 01:00:36,505
Rym: They should study that.

1125
01:00:36,525 --> 01:00:44,280
Scott: They should send drones up into the clouds and try to figure out like they clearly show like the turtle rain God a couple of times.

1126
01:00:44,661 --> 01:00:45,908
Rym: The movie almost makes this point.

1127
01:00:46,209 --> 01:00:49,122
Rym: Only this don't try to solve the problem, right?

1128
01:00:49,142 --> 01:00:59,782
Scott: This priest guy clearly knows everything that's up because he's a. this is absolutely a real thing and we could solve it by sacrificing our friend.

1129
01:00:59,882 --> 01:01:00,103
Scott: Okay.

1130
01:01:00,123 --> 01:01:01,551
Scott: We've decided not to do that.

1131
01:01:01,772 --> 01:01:05,471
Rym: or let's fly up there and like investigate these sky fish that are slowly.

1132
01:01:05,491 --> 01:01:13,573
Scott: And it's like, all right, well, you're not going to try anything to make it not rain and say, well, I guess if society is not ruined, you wouldn't care about trying.

1133
01:01:13,674 --> 01:01:13,895
Scott: Yep.

1134
01:01:14,056 --> 01:01:14,358
Scott: Right.

1135
01:01:14,458 --> 01:01:18,898
Scott: But that's it is unrealistic that the society would not be ruined.

1136
01:01:19,139 --> 01:01:28,062
Rym: And I guess like in conclusion, just cause I'm hungry and I'm, I think I've done with the show here, all this combined left me very like unsatisfied and unsettled.

1137
01:01:28,103 --> 01:01:31,558
Rym: after this movie, like after it ended, I just felt conflicted.

1138
01:01:31,578 --> 01:01:31,940
Rym: Yeah.

1139
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:41,672
Rym: I mean, there were definitely like, you know, great moments, like the little cards and who's dating every girl in his school and then the girl, like the girls help him escape from the college.

1140
01:01:41,692 --> 01:01:42,336
Scott: That was awesome.

1141
01:01:42,436 --> 01:01:42,658
Scott: Right.

1142
01:01:42,698 --> 01:01:45,694
Scott: There's, there's parts and this characters that are totally awesome.

1143
01:01:46,056 --> 01:01:47,925
Scott: There's a lot of stuff that's in here.

1144
01:01:47,965 --> 01:01:49,411
Scott: That's like really great.

1145
01:01:49,612 --> 01:01:57,297
Scott: And like it feel like parts of a great anime, but then that overall picture, right.

1146
01:01:57,437 --> 01:01:58,280
Scott: And, and message.

1147
01:01:58,441 --> 01:02:01,133
Scott: When you look, when you zoom out is like, yeah.

1148
01:02:01,535 --> 01:02:01,716
Rym: Yeah.

1149
01:02:01,756 --> 01:02:06,415
Rym: Like it edges into problematic to a point that I'm kind of mad about.

1150
01:02:06,435 --> 01:02:12,800
Scott: It's like you edited, you edited parts of a great anime movie, you know, to make, uh, an overall picture.

1151
01:02:13,281 --> 01:02:13,903
Scott: that doesn't work.

1152
01:02:14,284 --> 01:02:14,625
Rym: Yeah.

1153
01:02:14,846 --> 01:02:15,107
Scott: Right.

1154
01:02:15,909 --> 01:02:18,457
Scott: So, uh, that's what that is.

1155
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:21,388
Scott: Like you get to plenty of Shinkai clouds though.

1156
01:02:21,930 --> 01:02:23,718
Scott: Expect more Shinkai soon, I guess.

1157
01:02:23,738 --> 01:02:28,466
Rym: Like if I had a lot of money, he's going to keep making more in terms of the list of movies here that he's known for.

1158
01:02:28,527 --> 01:02:35,074
Rym: Like if I had to rank them, I think, I mean, your name is the best one from every angle I could look at.

1159
01:02:35,114 --> 01:02:35,315
Rym: Yeah.

1160
01:02:35,536 --> 01:02:35,737
Rym: Yeah.

1161
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:39,319
Rym: I actually think the place promise in our early days is the second best work.

1162
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:39,922
Scott: I agree with that.

1163
01:02:40,605 --> 01:02:44,099
Rym: Uh, and then voices of a distant star and then children.

1164
01:02:44,159 --> 01:02:45,467
Rym: I mean, we reviewed it.

1165
01:02:45,568 --> 01:02:47,983
Rym: You can listen to our old review of children who chase lost voices.

1166
01:02:48,124 --> 01:02:51,119
Rym: It's got, it's deeply because I don't remember anything.

1167
01:02:51,179 --> 01:02:57,003
Scott: So you have to go, you have to go ask Scott who saw the movie recently to get information.

1168
01:02:57,505 --> 01:03:12,487
Scott: Weathering with you reminds me of children who chase lost voices in one very specific way, but that made the thing is whether I disagree or don't or find some parts of weathering with you like distasteful, I can't say it's a bad, boring, no, no, no good movie.

1169
01:03:12,507 --> 01:03:14,333
Scott: Like it's voices.

1170
01:03:14,674 --> 01:03:14,915
Rym: Yeah.

1171
01:03:15,196 --> 01:03:18,553
Rym: But children chase lost voices left me feeling very empty afterward.

1172
01:03:18,573 --> 01:03:21,637
Rym: Like I didn't feel anything about the movie, but I didn't feel anything during the movie.

1173
01:03:21,698 --> 01:03:22,584
Scott: I couldn't tell you the name of it.

1174
01:03:22,604 --> 01:03:34,754
Rym: I couldn't even tell you a character, but during the movie, it was almost like an, an inverted, uh, castle in the sky and that it almost portrayed like a broken down Lopita type world.

1175
01:03:35,316 --> 01:03:36,400
Rym: Everything's just broken down.

1176
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:39,074
Scott: I was, I was bored and uninterested right here.

1177
01:03:39,134 --> 01:03:39,396
Scott: I was.

1178
01:03:39,436 --> 01:03:44,387
Rym: well, that could be form as function like sky crawlers, which you loved, which is boring on purpose to make you start.

1179
01:03:44,407 --> 01:03:46,481
Scott: That's a different, that's a different kind of boring.

1180
01:03:46,521 --> 01:03:53,504
Scott: That is boring because the tone of sky crawlers or night in the galactic railroad.

1181
01:03:53,625 --> 01:03:53,906
Scott: Yeah.

1182
01:03:53,947 --> 01:04:00,133
Scott: I knew you were going to bring up that on the tone of those is quiet and slow paced consistently.

1183
01:04:00,595 --> 01:04:00,896
Scott: Right.

1184
01:04:00,997 --> 01:04:05,941
Scott: And that's could be boring because you could fall asleep just because it's sort of like a lullaby, right?

1185
01:04:06,142 --> 01:04:13,066
Scott: But you, there's a difference between a good lullaby and a song that is not a lullaby.

1186
01:04:13,327 --> 01:04:15,939
Scott: That's just, you fall asleep, but you're not supposed to.

1187
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:16,541
Scott: Yup.

1188
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:16,862
Scott: Right.

1189
01:04:17,484 --> 01:04:21,018
Rym: So, but they both left me feeling kind of empty.

1190
01:04:21,078 --> 01:04:25,876
Rym: Like I didn't come out with a strong feeling about any like message or moral.

1191
01:04:26,558 --> 01:04:33,246
Rym: And it also what didn't have that, like the emotional climax was not that strong compared to almost any other movie he's made.

1192
01:04:33,326 --> 01:04:39,994
Scott: Well, if you want to come out feeling right and have a strong climax, I got the movie for you.

1193
01:04:40,015 --> 01:04:41,100
Scott: It's called parasite.

1194
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:44,498
Scott: You should be able to see it somewhere, hopefully digitally soon.

1195
01:04:44,598 --> 01:04:45,442
Scott: And I'm going to go eat dinner.

1196
01:04:45,643 --> 01:04:45,884
Scott: Yup.

1197
01:04:47,691 --> 01:04:50,262
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1198
01:04:50,283 --> 01:04:55,147
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1199
01:04:55,348 --> 01:05:00,392
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion, news, and more.

1200
01:05:00,653 --> 01:05:03,306
Rym: Remember GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1201
01:05:03,467 --> 01:05:08,092
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, gaming Tuesdays, anime comic Wednesdays, and indiscriminate Thursdays.

1202
01:05:08,414 --> 01:05:11,329
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a creative commons attribution.

Scott: 3.0 license.

1204
01:05:12,836 --> 01:05:19,025
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience, but unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1205
01:05:21,293 --> 01:05:24,808
Rym: And the GeekNights, Patrion, Patrion's for this episode of GeekNights.

1206
01:05:25,190 --> 01:05:31,105
Rym: Uh, the order might be a little bit different than you're used to because they, they made a new patron manager and the internal UI change.

1207
01:05:31,507 --> 01:05:39,550
Rym: So, uh, it looks like it's sorting slightly differently, but it's still roughly in the, it should be in the order of how much you're pledging, but some other stuff changed.

1208
01:05:40,234 --> 01:05:41,844
Rym: Uh, Oh, it doesn't even show me the whole name.

1209
01:05:41,904 --> 01:05:42,367
Rym: God damn it.

1210
01:05:42,649 --> 01:05:43,515
Rym: I got to hover a little bit.

1211
01:05:43,999 --> 01:05:46,620
Rym: Anyway, I will figure out how to make this work better in the future.

1212
01:05:47,101 --> 01:05:52,548
Rym: But for the time being, the Patrion Patrion's are Alan Joyce, Heidi McNichol, Marty Greenia.

1213
01:05:52,849 --> 01:05:54,880
Rym: Just like a dude, Guy, Shartavishan, Link Ichi.

1214
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:57,248
Rym: You hold the key to my heart.

1215
01:05:58,172 --> 01:06:00,463
Rym: I got in one little fight and my mom got scared.

01:06:00,946 --> 01:06:21,928
Rym: Clinton Walton, MyStating.com, Jay Bantz, Ren from New Zealand, Ryan Perrin, Drew Openlander, Nicholas Brandau, Chris Midkiff, Mac, The Thirst for Hydrated Ganon, Dread, Lily Tenebrae, Chris Reimer, Finn, Sean Klein, Thomas Hahn, Shervin Von Horl, and a bunch of other people who chose not to be named or are given like a dollar, which is totally fine.

1217
01:06:21,969 --> 01:06:24,062
Rym: You give a dollar, you get pretty much the same as everyone else.

1218
01:06:24,645 --> 01:06:28,443
Rym: You might've noticed I uploaded something brand new, uh, for the patrons only.

1219
01:06:28,463 --> 01:06:41,808
Rym: The slides slightly zoomed in and weird, but basically it was a YouTube video of us doing an early version of a panel as we're workshopping it well ahead of anything we would ever put on YouTube for regular consumption.

1220
01:06:42,150 --> 01:06:47,634
Rym: There's going to be a lot more content like that, a lot more like behind the scenes, like variant runs.

1221
01:06:47,695 --> 01:06:48,779
Rym: like the other times.

1222
01:06:48,799 --> 01:06:49,846
Rym: we did a panel before.

1223
01:06:49,887 --> 01:06:52,001
Rym: we did the one that we thought was good enough to put on YouTube.

1224
01:06:52,483 --> 01:06:55,233
Rym: All that kind of stuff will all be all over the Patreon.

1225
01:06:55,574 --> 01:06:59,658
Rym: But now I leave you with some good life advice.
