1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,049
Rym: It's Wednesday, August 19th, 2020.

2
00:00:10,049 --> 00:00:10,290
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,386 --> 00:00:13,799
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,403
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,443 --> 00:00:19,674
Rym: Tonight, we are talking about the Devilman manga and the Gibi-ate?

6
00:00:20,336 --> 00:00:21,198
Rym: Gibi-ate?

7
00:00:21,639 --> 00:00:22,080
Rym: Gibi-er?

8
00:00:22,681 --> 00:00:24,030
Rym: The anime that's coming.

9
00:00:24,614 --> 00:00:25,560
Rym: Already out partially.

10
00:00:26,641 --> 00:00:27,657
Scott: Let's do this.

11
00:00:29,341 --> 00:00:32,049
Scott: So, I'm doing the podcast, you know, a little differently today.

12
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:35,620
Scott: for anyone who might be watching on the YouTubes, right?

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:44,220
Scott: It might look a little different because I'm standing looking into a much higher quality camera with maybe better, different, similar audio, I guess.

14
00:00:45,941 --> 00:00:50,380
Scott: But yeah, we tried to set up technology to do panels remotely, right?

15
00:00:50,861 --> 00:00:54,800
Scott: And, you know, it's pretty easy to podcast remotely because it's only audio, right?

16
00:00:54,961 --> 00:00:56,920
Scott: So you could just slump over your computer.

17
00:00:57,342 --> 00:00:58,628
Scott: You don't need to, you know, have.

18
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,140
Scott: you could just use a webcam if you want video, right?

19
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:01,976
Scott: It doesn't need to be good.

20
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:02,642
Scott: Yeah.

21
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:07,840
Rym: And like, you know, when we live stream the podcast, we started just live streaming like the production of the podcast.

22
00:01:08,162 --> 00:01:10,840
Rym: And when we first started it, you see, I'm just like slumped over my desk.

23
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,560
Rym: Scott is like laying on his back with his eyes closed like that's how we do the show.

24
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:15,100
Scott: Right.

25
00:01:15,901 --> 00:01:19,160
Scott: So to do a panel, we need like high quality video.

26
00:01:19,784 --> 00:01:21,100
Scott: And if we're separate, right?

27
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,880
Scott: This creates a whole host of problems.

28
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,780
Scott: At least we don't have to live stream it, which is good, right?

29
00:01:26,901 --> 00:01:29,339
Scott: I can just record video of me and audio of me.

30
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,539
Scott: Rym can record video and audio of him.

31
00:01:32,042 --> 00:01:36,040
Scott: But we also need to communicate with each other at the same time.

32
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:39,279
Scott: We need to be able to, you know, have some talking going on.

33
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:39,721
Scott: Yeah.

34
00:01:39,781 --> 00:01:43,180
Scott: So it's like, OK, I plug a microphone into my camera and I talk at it.

35
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,860
Scott: But then how does Rym hear what I'm saying?

36
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,020
Scott: Am I going to have two microphones, one for the computer?

37
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:50,440
Scott: And then I need to wear headphones so I can hear what Rym is saying.

38
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,100
Scott: So now I'm being recorded with headphones in my ears is not right.

39
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:54,902
Scott: Yeah.

40
00:01:54,922 --> 00:01:59,000
Scott: So in order to set this up is ridiculously complicated.

41
00:01:59,181 --> 00:02:04,320
Scott: So I set it up and we're testing it out for a podcast before we use it for a panel.

42
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:04,661
Rym: Yep.

43
00:02:04,682 --> 00:02:06,460
Rym: Basically, we recorded one panel already.

44
00:02:06,581 --> 00:02:12,180
Rym: So if you want, if you go to the Crunchyroll Expo online, like somewhere in that schedule, judge anime by its cover.

45
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:17,600
Rym: That was like version one of our recording panels remotely pipeline upcoming at the Penny Arcade Expo.

46
00:02:17,822 --> 00:02:19,419
Scott: That was a worse setup than this.

47
00:02:19,741 --> 00:02:21,019
Scott: This one's a better setup, I think.

48
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,120
Rym: This one's a lot better setup, but I'll tell you all the secret.

49
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:28,939
Rym: If you watch our Crunchyroll panel, it sounds like we're doing a good back and forth, like we're doing a normal panel thing.

50
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:34,100
Rym: I could only understand about 50, maybe 60 percent of what Scott was saying.

51
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,260
Rym: I just couldn't hear Scott.

52
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,080
Scott: We were communicating.

53
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,699
Scott: I had Discord on an iPad in front of me.

54
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:44,340
Rym: I had Discord in front of me on a laptop and a shitty webcam pointed at me just out of frame.

55
00:02:44,441 --> 00:02:45,314
Rym: So Scott could hear me.

56
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:53,160
Scott: Rym was hearing me because I was yelling at the iPad and the iPad built in microphone was picking me up and sending it over to Discord.

57
00:02:53,702 --> 00:02:59,360
Scott: And then I was hearing Rym because I had headphones that were Bluetooth connected to the iPad and disconnected at one point.

58
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:08,560
Scott: So now the new setup, I managed to get my computer, like my computer, my camera to output not just video, but also audio over the HDMI cable.

59
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:10,779
Scott: And that's picked up by the capture card.

60
00:03:11,243 --> 00:03:20,779
Scott: And then on the computer, I have a whole bunch of crazy nonsense that somehow sorts everything out between Discord, recording software, OBS, all kinds of nonsense.

61
00:03:22,042 --> 00:03:25,019
Scott: And then the camera can also is recording video and audio too.

62
00:03:26,026 --> 00:03:26,539
Scott: So, yeah.

63
00:03:26,861 --> 00:03:27,043
Rym: Yeah.

64
00:03:27,184 --> 00:03:28,438
Rym: I just cannot express to you.

65
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:36,820
Rym: Like it's interesting because I'm talking to a lot of people in the games industry because a lot of people are having trouble making their panels in this current environment.

66
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:37,959
Rym: But think of this.

67
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,479
Scott: They're experts on the thing they do.

68
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,899
Scott: They're not experts on cameras and video and audio.

69
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:42,302
Scott: Yeah.

70
00:03:42,362 --> 00:03:44,838
Rym: Scott and I, like we've done GeekNights by ourselves for 15 years.

71
00:03:45,361 --> 00:03:47,180
Rym: So like if we wanted a video, guess what?

72
00:03:47,544 --> 00:03:48,580
Rym: We're both learning Premiere.

73
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:49,959
Rym: We want audio, guess what?

74
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,120
Rym: Audio engineers, fancy microphones.

75
00:03:52,261 --> 00:03:55,380
Rym: Like we've basically been doing everything ourselves.

76
00:03:56,021 --> 00:03:57,880
Rym: So, kind of pretty well positioned.

77
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:08,599
Rym: Meanwhile, I was like coaching literal industry professionals who like their job is to give lectures at conventions and they are struggling to like record themselves talking for 20 minutes in OBS.

78
00:04:10,262 --> 00:04:11,190
Scott: Yeah.

79
00:04:11,231 --> 00:04:12,180
Scott: They're not camera people.

80
00:04:12,241 --> 00:04:13,180
Scott: They don't know how to use a camera.

81
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:23,500
Rym: Like do you think Jon Stewart, like you watch the Daily Show for 20 years, do you think Jon Stewart like could just set up all those cameras and make all that like nice color grading and everything happen for a home podcast?

82
00:04:24,724 --> 00:04:26,000
Scott: No, he has no idea probably.

83
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,560
Scott: Yeah, he might, but probably not.

84
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:33,700
Rym: But usually the talent is like when someone's called the talent, on one hand, you might think, oh, yeah, like they're the person who's like the star.

85
00:04:34,121 --> 00:04:44,040
Rym: But that also means like the stage crew front, like back of house, front of house, all the people who are like dealing with them, when they refer to the talent, it means those are the people who literally can do nothing but be on stage.

86
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,816
Rym: And our sole job is to make them look like they know what they're doing.

87
00:04:48,002 --> 00:04:56,020
Scott: I think it's just the general philosophy of like, you know, if I have a problem, I Google, I read things, I follow instructions.

88
00:04:56,483 --> 00:04:58,160
Scott: I learn how to do something, right?

89
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,418
Scott: There's a lot of people who just don't want to learn, don't care to learn, don't try to learn.

90
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,660
Scott: They have a narrow focus, not a broad focus.

91
00:05:05,741 --> 00:05:07,059
Scott: They only learn in their area.

92
00:05:07,201 --> 00:05:09,120
Scott: They don't learn other areas, right?

93
00:05:09,181 --> 00:05:10,039
Scott: All that sort of stuff.

94
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,019
Rym: Yeah, like you know, I learned audio engineering.

95
00:05:12,561 --> 00:05:19,200
Rym: I was making mixtapes when I was like in middle school and they sounded like butt when I played them in the computer, like in the car.

96
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,617
Rym: So then I wanted them to sound better and I learned about equalizers and it just went down a rabbit hole from there.

97
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:26,639
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

98
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,700
Scott: So yeah, I guess that's the thing.

99
00:05:29,701 --> 00:05:36,460
Rym: But anyway, that segues into some news because there actually has already been a couple of like online anime conventions and things.

100
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,299
Rym: I think like there was OdaQuest, I think happened last weekend.

101
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:47,600
Rym: I saw people like talking about it a little bit, but I didn't really see that chatter until Sunday when it was like mostly done.

102
00:05:49,162 --> 00:05:51,860
Scott: Yeah, so basically all I, I don't know details.

103
00:05:52,141 --> 00:05:56,940
Scott: All I see is on Twitter, people who are deeper in the anime scene than we are, right?

104
00:05:57,361 --> 00:06:03,858
Scott: Are being like, hey, there was an online anime convention or maybe more, there's at least two, but maybe more than two.

105
00:06:04,502 --> 00:06:13,320
Scott: And those online anime conventions somehow, you know, got high quality Japanese guests to appear online at their convention, right?

106
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,459
Scott: So they must have paid the money.

107
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:22,538
Scott: And so the content at these online conventions was like interview with amazing director with a translator online.

108
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:35,180
Scott: And it's like, there's tons of these like an amazing amount of content that's like, you know, not been available before because a lot of those things would happen at anime cons in rooms that weren't streamed or recorded or uploaded.

109
00:06:37,622 --> 00:06:42,419
Scott: We're now put online where anyone in the whole world could see them, not just people who could go to an anime con.

110
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,439
Scott: Maybe, I'm sure it wasn't free, but I'm sure it also wasn't 50 bucks.

111
00:06:48,442 --> 00:06:51,920
Scott: And a whole bunch of this stuff happened, but seems like no one knew about it.

112
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,099
Scott: Even people who were like, would have like loved to do.

113
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,600
Scott: it only found out afterwards or not at all.

114
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:04,620
Rym: Yeah, this was like powered by Anime Central, like a serious thing that I kept hearing about it like vaguely.

115
00:07:04,741 --> 00:07:07,600
Rym: And I thought, oh, I should see like, maybe I can submit a panel or something.

116
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,100
Rym: And then when I actually went to look at it, it had already happened.

117
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,339
Rym: Like if the event had happened and I just missed it.

118
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,607
Scott: Yoko Kanno was in this thing.

119
00:07:14,627 --> 00:07:16,199
Scott: We just missed all this great anime stuff.

120
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,316
Scott: Yoko Kanno.

121
00:07:18,336 --> 00:07:18,700
Rym: Yeah, right?

122
00:07:21,183 --> 00:07:21,636
Rym: God damn it.

123
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,534
Rym: But like, there's another convention happening.

124
00:07:23,554 --> 00:07:27,020
Scott: It's like, oh yeah, we had the greatest online anime con and we didn't tell anybody.

125
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,080
Rym: There's like another one happening this weekend.

126
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,600
Rym: That's like, I think, Magfest, a bunch of other content putting something together.

127
00:07:31,721 --> 00:07:34,600
Rym: But like, I never saw like a call to panels.

128
00:07:34,901 --> 00:07:37,240
Rym: I never get like, I didn't get press releases.

129
00:07:37,863 --> 00:07:43,880
Rym: Like, I don't know what's going on here, but I feel like a lot of online cons are the people who are running them.

130
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:49,820
Rym: And we're not saying this happened with these particular cons because I don't know the details of why these particular cons didn't pierce our bubble.

131
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,359
Scott: Because I don't know anything about them.

132
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,200
Scott: How can I know what to criticize if I don't know anything?

133
00:07:54,480 --> 00:08:06,679
Rym: You want like, I think what happened is that like us, like, you know how I find out about a convention to appear at or something because I get a press release because I'm on mailing lists like industry mailing lists and I didn't get shit about this stuff.

134
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:13,940
Rym: Meanwhile, most larger anime cons in the US at least have a history of not advertising.

135
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,660
Rym: Like, they never have to advertise.

136
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:20,519
Rym: They kind of assume people will show up because they have a bad, like, they run out of badges to sell, they fail.

137
00:08:21,081 --> 00:08:23,560
Rym: So, it kind of just worked out that way.

138
00:08:24,102 --> 00:08:26,938
Rym: Like, advertising would almost make their situation worse rather than better.

139
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:34,359
Scott: But also, I have seen some cons advertise and they usually advertise on like cheap local media, right?

140
00:08:35,101 --> 00:08:38,600
Scott: Because they're local events where people come visit from around town.

141
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:40,938
Scott: You know, it's like you try to get the townies to come.

142
00:08:41,642 --> 00:08:44,777
Scott: If you're trying to advertise to the internet, that's very difficult.

143
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:54,100
Rym: Most of the people who go to conventions in general, not just anime conventions, but also gaming cons and everything else, they all go for a lot of different reasons, mostly to hang out.

144
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,739
Rym: Like, there's a lot of stuff they want to do with these cons.

145
00:08:56,262 --> 00:09:00,820
Rym: And at most cons, the guests and the panel content are not actually the biggest draw.

146
00:09:01,682 --> 00:09:04,460
Rym: Like, that might surprise you, but kind of sadly true.

147
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:17,680
Rym: But I feel like, and again, not saying that this con did that, but I think this happened in a lot of instances, they kind of assumed that the people who go to the con in person would be interested in engaging with their content online.

148
00:09:18,102 --> 00:09:27,440
Rym: And thus, they assumed that number, our normal attendance number, is probably like a nice baseline number of who would come to the online version because the online version is free or cheaper.

149
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:35,520
Rym: But the reality is, I think the majority of the people who go to conventions are not interested in the online versions of these conventions.

150
00:09:37,482 --> 00:09:44,517
Rym: Like, I think about how many people interact at cons, they're mostly hanging out with their friends, like in anime cons, they're mostly hanging out cosplaying and running around yelling at each other.

151
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,532
Rym:  Going to room parties, stuff like that.

152
00:09:47,552 --> 00:09:48,078
Rym:  Yeah, pretty much.

153
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,340
Scott: Plus, you have to consider, right, it's like, you know, GDQ is happening right now.

154
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:58,598
Scott: It's like, if I'm turning on, you know, my computer to watch something, everything in the world is competing with GDQ.

155
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,261
Scott:  Yup.

156
00:09:59,281 --> 00:10:01,639
Scott:  That's a tough cut, that's a tough cut.

157
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:06,680
Rym: Oh my god, that Zelda 2 reverse boss order run, once I realized it was also a glitch run.

158
00:10:08,002 --> 00:10:12,200
Scott: I didn't realize, I was like, reverse boss order, how are they going to get to the Thunderbird first?

159
00:10:12,281 --> 00:10:16,004
Scott: They have to be doing like the second to last boss first so that they can.

160
00:10:16,044 --> 00:10:24,080
Scott: then eventually, are they going to go from dungeon one through the end and get all the items, then go back and beat the bungeons in reverse, then I'll go to the final dungeon.

161
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,419
Scott: It's like, nope, Thunderbird first.

162
00:10:26,465 --> 00:10:33,739
Rym: Yup, it was like, it was one of the glitchier, like it is up there in terms of glitch runs with like the Final Fantasy 4 staircase run.

163
00:10:35,286 --> 00:10:35,718
Scott: Pretty much.

164
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:44,560
Rym: But so yeah, there's probably some online anime cons, but I don't know, the only one we really know about and are performing at right now is the Crunchyroll Expo.

165
00:10:45,761 --> 00:10:54,559
Rym: And other than answering questions added, I don't think I'm going to go, like I'm not going to go to other online content from most of these cons, because again, like you said.

166
00:10:54,820 --> 00:11:07,719
Scott: No, I really, you know, if these cons want, you know, if you're, if you're having online con and your online con is literally just a bunch of videos, right, for people to pay and watch, don't make it like some live event.

167
00:11:08,442 --> 00:11:16,040
Scott: Just put the videos up on YouTube, even charge money for the videos if you want, but just put them up there for all time so anyone can come and see them whenever.

168
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,980
Scott: And then people will come and see them whenever.

169
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:28,160
Scott: Or if you're just like, all right, today for six hours, there's going to be video content on this one TV channel, temporary television channel, limited time only, then it's gone.

170
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,940
Rym: It's like, I don't even watch GDQ live usually.

171
00:11:32,181 --> 00:11:36,419
Rym: Usually I'll watch the VOD on YouTube, like later that day or the next day.

172
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,960
Scott: I'll watch some of it live, but not much, right?

173
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,220
Scott: Just a little bit, whatever.

174
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,558
Scott: Like I watch it during lunch.

175
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:50,780
Rym: But like whatever you do with online cons, if something's live, there's got to be some interactive reason for people to be there live for it.

176
00:11:51,202 --> 00:11:59,399
Rym: Even if it's like a Discord where all the people watching the channel are like interacting and there's some reason to do that interaction, you got to have some reason.

177
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:06,280
Scott: I just find it sad that suddenly, right, it's like all this amazing anime con type content has been created.

178
00:12:06,882 --> 00:12:07,719
Scott: And where is it?

179
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,159
Scott: And who knows about it?

180
00:12:09,803 --> 00:12:12,019
Scott: It's like a sad situation of like, no, why?

181
00:12:12,422 --> 00:12:12,533
Rym: Yep.

182
00:12:13,341 --> 00:12:15,359
Rym: So in some other news, that's actually a pretty big deal.

183
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:21,679
Rym: A bunch of shitty piracy sites for manga and anime are now gone for good.

184
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,120
Rym: KISS anime and KISS manga are dead.

185
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,360
Scott: So now like we're never been against piracy, right?

186
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:36,139
Scott: It's like, if you want to watch something and you know, you can't afford it or it's only on like one service, you don't want to set up for that service.

187
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,000
Scott: It's the only thing you want to watch on there.

188
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,860
Scott: You know, yeah, there's plenty of legitimate reasons that I will never tell anyone like, don't pirate, right?

189
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,939
Scott: You're poor and they're charging 20 bucks.

190
00:12:46,582 --> 00:12:48,660
Scott: So many valid reasons to pirate something.

191
00:12:49,801 --> 00:12:52,280
Scott: You know, I'm never going to go say don't pirate.

192
00:12:52,781 --> 00:13:11,840
Scott: What I don't like is the other side of piracy, which is where, you know, not someone who wants to watch something goes out and watches it by any means necessary, but someone who takes a bunch of stuff, a whole bunch, and then sells it to make money, even though they didn't make it, nor do they have rights to sell it, right?

193
00:13:12,241 --> 00:13:18,880
Scott: So if you go, you know, we're talking like, I don't, you know, someone goes and buys a bootleg, you know, CD in the nineties.

194
00:13:19,042 --> 00:13:19,377
Scott: Okay.

195
00:13:19,781 --> 00:13:23,280
Scott: Someone has a bunch of bootleg CDs in the nineties and sells them on a street corner.

196
00:13:23,526 --> 00:13:24,059
Scott: Not okay.

197
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:24,620
Scott: Right.

198
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:46,840
Scott: So we're talking about a situation here where if you go online and you search for various anime or manga titles that you want to watch, right, for the many, many years, including today, you know, Google, the highest results, many, many results in the front page, sometimes even the first result would be illegal sites.

199
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:51,420
Rym: Which causes a weird third problem that I never even considered until this occurred.

200
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:56,338
Rym: It's been occurring for a while now, but the problem of someone doesn't actually realize they're pirating now.

201
00:13:57,463 --> 00:13:58,739
Scott: Of course, they just go to Google.

202
00:13:58,901 --> 00:14:01,958
Scott: They say, I want to read this manga and the top link, they click it.

203
00:14:02,282 --> 00:14:03,160
Scott: They can read the manga.

204
00:14:03,382 --> 00:14:05,240
Scott: It's right there, surrounded by advertisements.

205
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:12,840
Scott: It looks legitimate, but actually it's a pirated site that took scanslations or whatever, or just scanned in the actual manga or something like that.

206
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:18,840
Rym: Some of these services even just charge money for access, like selling it like it's a full-on thing.

207
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,860
Scott: Yeah, it's like, oh, no one's going to make a legit one.

208
00:14:21,901 --> 00:14:23,180
Scott: I'll just make an illegal one.

209
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:27,396
Scott: And it's like, all right, though, you know, it's like one thing for Pirate Bay, right?

210
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,820
Scott: It's another thing for someone to go out and do this.

211
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,940
Rym: So I've encountered so many anime weebs who literally thought KissAnime was a legitimate site.

212
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:46,879
Scott: Right, so that's a big news is that KissAnime, one of the larger of these pirated, not legit, you know, watch anime sites is gone, bye-bye.

213
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:49,400
Scott: For reasons.

214
00:14:49,780 --> 00:15:07,580
Rym: Yep, now what is interesting in the anime world, more so than other areas of piracy, like I don't see hockey fans making this argument with the pirate streams, like when Reddit NHL streams went down, but I do see this with American anime fans specifically.

215
00:15:08,662 --> 00:15:21,839
Rym: There's a specific sort of like weird entitlement of, I have a right to watch this content no matter what, coupled with a like the official release is broken or wrong in some way.

216
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,238
Rym: Like they always make an excuse.

217
00:15:25,542 --> 00:15:27,940
Scott: The first one, I kind of agree with, right?

218
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:35,217
Scott: I believe that if there is art, right, that all humans sort of have a right to view it.

219
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:43,559
Scott: If you have some art, like let's say you have some painting and you just keep it locked up and you never display it and no one can see it, you know, fuck you.

220
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:47,439
Scott: We should go and take that painting from you and hang it up in a museum where people can see it.

221
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:51,138
Rym: But we do need a way to compensate artists so that art continues to be made.

222
00:15:52,301 --> 00:15:53,159
Rym: We have not solved that problem.

223
00:15:53,742 --> 00:15:56,660
Scott: The current system is the correct one, right?

224
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,134
Scott: So, you know, there's...

225
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,820
Rym: Oh, yeah, we need massive copyright reform.

226
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,735
Rym: We need public funding for the arts, et cetera.

227
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:17,999
Rym: But the fact that the anime fans will try to make a dual moral argument of one, I have a right to this content and two, my excuse is and they'll make up some shit like they translated the subtitles wrong in the official release.

228
00:16:19,507 --> 00:16:19,590
Scott: Okay.

229
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,219
Rym: If you're going to pirate stuff, well, one, they're usually wrong about that.

230
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:29,160
Rym: Like, all I'm saying is if you're going to sail the high seas, do not pretend you were doing anything noble, just sail.

231
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,620
Rym: Like, just be a pirate.

232
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:40,578
Rym: Don't try to pretend that you're taking this moral stance because Funimation censored the titty stuff in your anime when they actually did no such thing and you're literally making shit up.

233
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:41,601
Scott: Right.

234
00:16:41,742 --> 00:16:51,020
Scott: But also, you know, if you have a legitimate reason for why you're pirating, right, it's like, why make up the bullshit reason or tell yourself a bullshit reason?

235
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,740
Scott: They probably actually believe that reason.

236
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,654
Scott: That's why they say it.

237
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,620
Scott: But just say the real reason.

238
00:16:55,741 --> 00:16:59,780
Scott: The real reason is I'm a teenager with no fucking money and I like anime.

239
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,120
Scott: I want to watch a lot of it and I have a lot of free time.

240
00:17:02,542 --> 00:17:08,119
Scott: I can't possibly afford to buy legitimately the amount of anime that I want to watch.

241
00:17:08,483 --> 00:17:09,378
Scott: So I'm going to pirate it.

242
00:17:09,621 --> 00:17:10,060
Scott: I'm not going to lie.

243
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,979
Rym: The only reason I didn't pirate anime in middle school was that there was no way to do so.

244
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:18,000
Rym: But I did get fan subs, which is very close to piracy.

245
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,440
Scott: The only difference is those things were literally not licensed back then.

246
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,559
Scott: That is a perfectly legitimate reason for pirating in my eyes.

247
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,338
Scott: They're overcharging and you can't afford it.

248
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,100
Rym: All right, go ahead and pirate.

249
00:17:29,641 --> 00:17:32,739
Rym: On one hand, society is broken and we need to fund this stuff.

250
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:44,660
Rym: But two, sites like KissAnime are basically the bottom of the barrel because they are both extracting money as a rent-seeking middleman to enable that piracy and denying money to the creators.

251
00:17:45,024 --> 00:17:46,400
Rym: So they are skimming off the top.

252
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,520
Rym: They are just leeches.

253
00:17:48,344 --> 00:17:52,018
Rym: If you're going to pirate all this anime, there are other ways to pirate it.

254
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:58,072
Rym: And the one thing I'd say is that if you live in America, go learn how to pirate things.

255
00:17:58,112 --> 00:17:59,079
Rym: if you're going to pirate things.

256
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:00,596
Scott: That's right.

257
00:18:02,503 --> 00:18:06,140
Scott: Learn how to pirate things without giving money or on some shady-ass website.

258
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:09,800
Rym: Yeah, and the only other advice I have on that before we move on is don't pirate software.

259
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:10,780
Rym: It's all malware.

260
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,244
Rym: 100% of it.

261
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,140
Rym: You might think you know a way to pirate it.

262
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:13,600
Rym: You're wrong.

263
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:17,739
Rym: I guarantee there are ways to pirate software and you do not have access to them.

264
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,193
Scott: That's right.

265
00:18:20,447 --> 00:18:20,678
Scott: Okay.

266
00:18:21,081 --> 00:18:21,459
Rym: All right.

267
00:18:22,307 --> 00:18:39,999
Rym: In some other related news, not like semi-related, because it's related to weeb anger, a bunch of animation studios in Japan have basically taken a bunch of classic family kids-type anime and they put it all on a Japan-only YouTube channel just free.

268
00:18:40,601 --> 00:18:45,119
Rym: Like Future Boy Conan, Black Jack, Astro Boy, a bunch of old Takahata stuff.

269
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:48,379
Scott: See, this is what Japan needs to do more of.

270
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,280
Rym: Oh, Japan only though.

271
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,040
Rym: It's not yet available in the rest of the world.

272
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:51,869
Rym: Only Japan.

273
00:18:51,889 --> 00:18:52,840
Scott: Oh, they fucked it up.

274
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:53,796
Scott: Ah, no, no, no, no, no.

275
00:18:54,343 --> 00:19:01,140
Rym: So, nerds are all seeing that and saying, "Oh, well, they fucked it up," because that's what would normally happen.

276
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:10,135
Rym: However, they did issue a press release saying, "The plan is to add subtitles in English and Chinese and open this channel up in the

277
00:19:10,155 --> 00:19:10,478
Rym: future.".

278
00:19:11,301 --> 00:19:12,358
Rym: The channel's brand new.

279
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:13,399
Rym: Give us a minute.

280
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,240
Rym: Jesus Christ, basically.

281
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:28,360
Scott: There have been a few recent legitimate services like Retro Crush, which you can just go get, where you can watch a lot of... They've somehow licensed a large, somewhat large number of old titles, right?

282
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:35,360
Scott: I guess really cheap licenses, things no one wants to watch, things no one wants to pay for, and managed to put them up on a free service.

283
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,720
Scott: I'd think there's ads or something.

284
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,218
Scott: You know, they get their money some other way.

285
00:19:39,743 --> 00:19:41,660
Scott: And there's actually a lot of good old stuff.

286
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,060
Scott: It's just stuff that most people don't give a crap about.

287
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:48,940
Rym: Yeah, and there's not enough demand to make a formal overseas release.

288
00:19:49,061 --> 00:19:50,599
Rym: You're never going to make money selling this.

289
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:51,903
Scott: No, no, no.

290
00:19:51,923 --> 00:19:54,000
Rym: But it's also an important part of culture and history.

291
00:19:54,881 --> 00:19:57,720
Rym: And even the article notes, no one pirates this stuff either.

292
00:19:58,301 --> 00:20:00,213
Rym: It's not even really pirated that often.

293
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:00,938
Rym: Nope.

294
00:20:01,381 --> 00:20:07,920
Rym: So, the people who own the content, especially if you own it on YouTube, cost you nothing other than the administration of the YouTube channel.

295
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,160
Rym: You're not even paying for bandwidth.

296
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:26,027
Scott: Yeah, but we could do a whole show about how Japan, this huge country with tons of money, one of the bigger economies in the world, has this huge media empire of music, movies, -That they're slowly advocating on.

297
00:20:26,048 --> 00:20:28,120
Scott: anime, manga, novels.

298
00:20:28,901 --> 00:20:33,000
Scott: And they say that they have this government program, Cool Japan.

299
00:20:33,542 --> 00:20:41,140
Scott: They want to make it popular around the world to get some soft power around the world and spread their culture.

300
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,084
Scott: But what do they do?

301
00:20:42,686 --> 00:20:45,859
Scott: is they always keep everything close to the chest.

302
00:20:47,702 --> 00:20:55,300
Scott: Even when they have bands that tour the world, the band will release a different CD in Japan that has more tracks on it.

303
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,819
Scott: And they won't even put those tracks on Spotify anywhere else.

304
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:04,360
Scott: And it's like they'll publish a manga and they won't let it go over to any other country translated.

305
00:21:05,401 --> 00:21:09,179
Scott: You ever seen a Japanese... They go on YouTube and they aggressively take everything down.

306
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:21,960
Scott: Meanwhile, South Korea, a tiny country with a lot less money than Japan, all their TV shows, all their music, everything free on YouTube, free on Spotify, free everywhere in the world.

307
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:28,440
Scott: They're just constantly putting out tons and tons of free content everywhere, just spreading it all over the place.

308
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,267
Scott: And oh, what do you know?

309
00:21:29,307 --> 00:21:32,059
Scott: K-pop took over the world and J-pop, no one gives a crap, right?

310
00:21:32,661 --> 00:21:36,940
Scott: So that's the story of Japan's media non-empire.

311
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:48,400
Scott: I think if Japan did somehow flip the switch and just put everything Japanese translated online for free, Japanese culture might actually take over the whole earth.

312
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,598
Rym: Well, you take a subset...

313
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,696
Scott: It's sort of a danger in the other scenario.

314
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:58,840
Rym: You take a low-risk subset of content that's hard to monetize both domestically and internationally and start with that.

315
00:21:59,081 --> 00:22:04,340
Rym: This is actually a very positive step and I think this is a carpenter of good things to come.

316
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:08,500
Scott: But... It's still way too little, too late, even if it's a toe in the water.

317
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,198
Scott: Hey, it's a start.

318
00:22:10,611 --> 00:22:10,839
Scott: Meanwhile...

319
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:19,097
Rym: Also, because despite all of this, anime is having this fandom and monetization renaissance in America right now.

320
00:22:19,962 --> 00:22:21,699
Scott: Because people are stuck at home right now.

321
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,419
Scott: They got time to watch anime.

322
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:39,700
Rym: However, the internet shouty men who like to talk about anime, like the people who are not going to listen to a show like this to learn about anime, their narrative on this, the way a lot of people reacted to this news was really weird.

323
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,480
Rym: And I think it's the same kind of people who tried to justify their use of kissanime.

324
00:22:44,401 --> 00:23:03,540
Rym: They basically tried to frame this as, and this was a big enough argument to where I saw real media people debunking it, that this was Japan striking back at Funimation and Crunchyroll for censoring anime and trying to push anime toward Western taste.

325
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,059
Scott: Japan doesn't give a crap about that.

326
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,240
Scott: Japan loves censoring stuff for the West.

327
00:23:08,421 --> 00:23:08,920
Rym: You know what it is?

328
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,300
Scott: They'll even say, "Please censor this for the West.

329
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,695
Scott: We don't want you to see crazy

330
00:23:12,716 --> 00:23:12,959
Scott: Japan.".

331
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:19,828
Rym: The weebs seem to think that, they know that Tim Apple makes every decision for Apple, so they seem to think that Mr.

332
00:23:19,868 --> 00:23:25,160
Rym: Japan is personally mad that their titty anime wasn't carried by Crunchyroll.

333
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:25,808
Scott: Yes, there's a Mr.

334
00:23:25,829 --> 00:23:26,420
Scott: Japan who controls everything.

335
00:23:27,182 --> 00:23:39,759
Rym: Because their titty anime was taken off of Crunchyroll, they think and they made up this narrative that Japan is trying to bypass Crunchyroll to get to the world with their titty anime, which is...

336
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,380
Scott: This is just a thing that happens everywhere, right?

337
00:23:42,762 --> 00:23:44,800
Scott: People see a thing happen, right?

338
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:48,280
Rym: And they mold it into whatever narrative they've already set forth in their head.

339
00:23:48,902 --> 00:24:05,492
Scott: They come up with whatever explanation matches their existing beliefs, they tie it in, and then they say it, because it makes so much sense to them, they say it as if it was true, and then other people believe it as if it was true because people start to spread it, and then suddenly it's a rumor, right?

340
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:16,759
Rym: Well, case in point, half the apocryphal stories from anime in the 90s and early 2000s came from someone who was given a panel at some con that wasn't recorded, they made some shit up.

341
00:24:16,961 --> 00:24:27,700
Rym: that sounded plausible, someone saw that panel, they then, years later, do their own panel, and they reference what they saw in that first panel, and now you've got people literally making shit up about the anime industry.

342
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:30,360
Scott: Well, I mean, about everything, right?

343
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:37,420
Scott: And I think that the solution to this is-- You don't see it in the games industry as much because a lot more of the panel-- You see it in the games industry.

344
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,044
Rym: Not as much.

345
00:24:38,165 --> 00:24:50,439
Rym: I think because the bigger game cons, more of their content was recorded earlier, so there was, like, people had less room to make shit up, and there were fewer fans doing panels without some sort of credential check.

346
00:24:50,842 --> 00:24:58,016
Scott: Or it could just be that you're paying attention to the English games industry in English, so people, it's hard to make stuff up when the people who, you know, right?

347
00:24:58,442 --> 00:25:11,180
Rym: There's a lot more people to call you on it, but, like, American anime fandom, English-speaking anime fans, all went to those conventions, so everything that sounded plausible was taken as truth, even in the wider industry discourse.

348
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:12,702
Scott: Yeah.

349
00:25:13,249 --> 00:25:16,280
Scott: I just think about, you know, I'm not even talking about, like, within nerdy industries.

350
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:20,080
Scott: I'm talking just about, in general, discourse of anything, right?

351
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:29,520
Scott: You know, rumors come to be when the original source of the information doesn't reveal all of the surrounding details, right?

352
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:34,480
Scott: If you come out with something and say, "Oh, yeah, we're delaying this product," right?

353
00:25:34,661 --> 00:25:35,600
Rym: It must be a conspiracy.

354
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,728
Scott: Well, it's like, well, people start to think, "Why are they delaying it?

355
00:25:39,849 --> 00:25:40,796
Scott: What was -- Mm, what

356
00:25:40,836 --> 00:25:41,159
Scott: happened?".

357
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:42,387
Scott: You know, right?

358
00:25:42,468 --> 00:25:49,060
Scott: It's like, if I'm delaying a product, I should say, "I'm delaying this product because every -- Here's every single detail.

359
00:25:49,482 --> 00:25:58,546
Scott: I ran out of money, and I need to find another investor to get this much because I had to let this person go, and that person had the skills to get us through this next phase, which isn't done yet,".

360
00:25:58,828 --> 00:25:58,949
Scott: right?

361
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:00,540
Scott: Tell everything, right?

362
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,288
Scott: No, I don't think that works.

363
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:11,579
Rym: There's no reason to keep -- Scott, as a product manager, I've found that that doesn't work because if you tell everything, a significant subset of people will assume you are lying or covering something up anyway.

364
00:26:13,381 --> 00:26:15,080
Scott: It's their problem, but it's still way less people.

365
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:20,452
Rym: Case in point, this article we're talking about, they said in their press release, "We're making English

366
00:26:20,493 --> 00:26:21,000
Rym: subtitles.".

367
00:26:21,222 --> 00:26:29,438
Rym: Like, that's in the plan, yet people were still just lying about it online and saying that this is just another example of Japan being closed.

368
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,119
Scott: 'Cause people only read the headline.

369
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,099
Rym: Yeah, exactly.

370
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:38,120
Scott: Whoever wrote the article about the press release probably didn't, you know, anyway, frame it correctly.

371
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,568
Rym: I feel like even if Mr.

372
00:26:39,628 --> 00:26:45,299
Rym: Japan said out loud -- Like, him and Tim Apple got together on a stage, and they were like, "Look, this is not in --".

373
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,699
Scott: Tim Apple's the number-one secret keeper.

374
00:26:47,242 --> 00:26:48,130
Scott: He's the secret keeper.

375
00:26:48,211 --> 00:26:49,140
Scott: He doesn't tell you anything.

376
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,028
Rym: Think about this, though.

377
00:26:50,088 --> 00:26:54,859
Rym: Imagine if Apple said, "Oh, iOS 14 is delayed because of

378
00:26:54,999 --> 00:26:55,019
Rym: X.".

379
00:26:55,221 --> 00:27:02,020
Rym: I feel like half the people who care about Apple News would immediately assume that because they revealed more information than usual that they were hiding something.

380
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,790
Scott: Well, they could just --.

381
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:07,700
Scott: That's the problem, is that they've been keeping secrets for so long.

382
00:27:07,781 --> 00:27:10,100
Scott: It's like a reverse wolf cry, right?

383
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:10,557
Rym: Yeah.

384
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,618
Scott: You have to never keep secrets to begin with.

385
00:27:13,363 --> 00:27:14,440
Scott: Build trust, right?

386
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,679
Scott: By keeping secrets all the time, you don't have trust.

387
00:27:17,022 --> 00:27:21,720
Scott: So now if you suddenly turn right and start being honest, you know, you got problems.

388
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,180
Scott: You got to be honest and completely open from the get-go, right, to have your correct reputation.

389
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:27,164
Rym: All right.

390
00:27:27,184 --> 00:27:29,839
Rym: So anyway, last and least, do you want to talk about this Leiji Matsumoto thing?

391
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:31,364
Scott: Right.

392
00:27:31,385 --> 00:27:32,959
Scott: So they're publishing this book.

393
00:27:33,303 --> 00:27:34,801
Scott: It's $45.

394
00:27:34,801 --> 00:27:37,059
Scott: So I do not blame anyone who doesn't want to buy this book.

395
00:27:37,442 --> 00:27:38,860
Scott: It's only for extreme nerds.

396
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:39,906
Scott: But basically --.

397
00:27:39,926 --> 00:27:42,460
Scott: I guess if you're doing research -- -You know, yeah.

398
00:27:42,821 --> 00:27:48,879
Scott: In Japan, right, people -- I mean, everywhere in the world, not just in Japan, but people write essays about things.

399
00:27:49,445 --> 00:27:51,040
Scott: It's a thing people do, right?

400
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:57,478
Scott: You know, write essays on stuff, book reports, you know, reviews of books in newspapers, all kinds of stuff, right?

401
00:27:58,962 --> 00:28:08,860
Scott: But it's like when a topic is very local, right, you know, you're only going to find, you know, people expounding and deeply investigating something that's local to them, right?

402
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:25,639
Scott: So if you wanted to learn a lot about, I don't know, some Belgian rock band, right, you're probably -- if they're super popular in Belgium, I bet you'd find a lot of articles and deep information about their history and who they were in Belgium, in a Belgian library.

403
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:29,039
Scott: If you could read, you know, right, you could read their material.

404
00:28:29,623 --> 00:28:31,439
Scott: You could find out a ton of information on them.

405
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:32,955
Scott: French.

406
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,319
Rym: Yeah, French or Flemish.

407
00:28:36,562 --> 00:28:39,755
Scott: The point is, if you're in the

408
00:28:39,856 --> 00:28:40,197
Scott: U.S.,

409
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:48,179
Scott: you've discovered that band, you go to the Wikipedia page, you're lucky if it's got one paragraph, you're lucky if any of your music's on Spotify, right?

410
00:28:48,563 --> 00:28:50,460
Scott: You just -- it's hard to learn about them, right?

411
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,598
Rym: I remember as a young anime fan, I found out about 2Mix.

412
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:53,593
Rym: I was like, "What is

413
00:28:53,777 --> 00:28:53,920
Rym: 2Mix?".

414
00:28:54,001 --> 00:28:55,239
Rym: I couldn't find anything in English.

415
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:56,763
Scott: Yep.

416
00:28:57,206 --> 00:29:02,600
Scott: So Japan, which has this media that keeps everything close to the chest, people want to find out about it.

417
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,960
Scott: You know, Leiji Matsumoto is someone that has a lot of fans around the world, especially in Italy.

418
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:08,999
Scott: He's got a ton of fans in Italy.

419
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:18,660
Scott: And, you know, if you want to learn about Leiji Matsumoto, there's actually tons of material people have written about him and his works in Japan, in Japanese, right?

420
00:29:19,262 --> 00:29:20,760
Scott: It's just not really available.

421
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,700
Scott: No one's republishing that in English, because who cares?

422
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,320
Scott: There's not a lot of English.

423
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:31,655
Scott: People who speak English or other non-Japanese languages, they care to watch Leiji Matsumoto's anime, right?

424
00:29:32,761 --> 00:29:35,900
Scott: But do they really care to read essays about Leiji Matsumoto?

425
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:36,585
Scott: Probably not.

426
00:29:36,666 --> 00:29:43,920
Scott: So when someone translates, or gathers and translates a pile of essays about Leiji Matsumoto in a book, that book costs $45.

427
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:52,919
Rym: It doesn't say how many pages it is, but that information is not actually revealed yet, but it has 60 photos in it.

428
00:29:54,803 --> 00:29:59,134
Scott: Yeah, so Helen McCarthy and, who's this, Darren John Ashmore, right?

429
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:08,760
Scott: I think they have compiled and translated a whole mess of Leiji Matsumoto essays so you can learn everything there is to know about Leiji Matsumoto.

430
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:11,133
Rym: "Previously unexplored biographical and bibliographic

431
00:30:11,173 --> 00:30:11,556
Rym: detail.".

432
00:30:12,883 --> 00:30:25,320
Scott: Short of actually meeting and knowing the person himself, or being the person himself, a book of essays is about as close as a complete stranger is going to get to knowing someone and what they're all about.

433
00:30:25,621 --> 00:30:26,831
Scott: So this book's coming.

434
00:30:27,073 --> 00:30:30,519
Scott: If you got $45 and you're a really big Matsumoto fan, buy it.

435
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:38,620
Rym: Or if you're putting together a panel for an online anime con on Leiji Matsumoto, this would be some really good source material.

436
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:44,540
Scott: Yeah, but I have a feeling that the author should probably be doing that panel, not you, a reader of the book.

437
00:30:45,102 --> 00:30:52,700
Rym: Your panel, if you're citing a book heavily, should cite at least multiple books and have a narrative based on the citations across those books.

438
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,200
Rym: I feel like there will be people who will buy this book and do a panel to base solely on this book, though.

439
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:03,120
Scott: But what it does mean, though, is that don't go read this book and just turn the book into a panel.

440
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:09,412
Scott: What you should do is realize that once this book comes out, there are those people who are going to pay $45 and read it.

441
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:23,460
Scott: And the authors themselves, you're going to be able to get some of that learning without buying and reading the book yourself because people are going to be reading it and then repeating what they have read in other relevant venues.

442
00:31:23,822 --> 00:31:29,220
Rym: Most of the history books I read will cite primary sources, but I don't usually go back and read all of those primary sources.

443
00:31:30,501 --> 00:31:31,015
Scott: Of course not.

444
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:39,139
Scott: So yeah, book's coming out, so there's going to be a lot of Leiji Matsumoto biographical information available in English sometime soon-ish.

445
00:31:39,402 --> 00:31:40,796
Scott: There you go.

446
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:48,730
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

447
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:58,289
Rym: So you probably saw with the last Star Wars movie that there was a funny little animation of what Palpatine was up to during the last movie.

448
00:32:00,113 --> 00:32:00,280
Scott: Sure.

449
00:32:00,911 --> 00:32:01,555
Rym: You didn't see that?

450
00:32:01,616 --> 00:32:14,288
Rym: It just pops out of the... Because it basically starts at the end when Vader throws him -- spoilers, I guess -- Vader throws him out of the ship and he goes flying off into space through that chute or whatever, and it shows like, "How do you end up in that

451
00:32:14,308 --> 00:32:14,409
Rym: chair?".

452
00:32:15,292 --> 00:32:17,550
Rym: And Yoda shows up and it's like this cute funny thing.

453
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:25,530
Rym: That channel is the same channel that made Big Top Burger and that has made a ton of short, desperately funny animations.

454
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:33,289
Rym: So what I'm linking to now, but I recommend you watch this whole channel, is titled "Frasier and Niles Become Demon

455
00:32:33,329 --> 00:32:33,570
Rym: Lords."

456
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:40,110
Rym: It's just a short animated clip of Frasier Crane and Niles Crane from the show Frasier.

457
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,628
Scott: How many listeners know what that is?

458
00:32:42,232 --> 00:32:46,329
Rym: You would be weirdly surprised how well-known Frasier is.

459
00:32:47,612 --> 00:32:48,530
Scott: Like, I know it exists.

460
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:52,230
Scott: I would see beginnings or ends of Frasier episodes when I was watching other television programs.

461
00:32:54,954 --> 00:32:57,209
Scott: But it did not look like anything I ever wanted to watch.

462
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,170
Rym: Oh, you would not have liked Frasier.

463
00:32:58,290 --> 00:32:59,329
Rym: You would not have watched that show.

464
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:02,948
Rym: However, it is popular among a lot of webcomics.

465
00:33:02,988 --> 00:33:03,230
Rym: people.

466
00:33:03,811 --> 00:33:12,510
Rym: People our age who ended up making webcomics and got famous, they all have weird encyclopedic memory of Frasier for reasons I don't actually understand.

467
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:13,930
Scott: It seems like a super white people show.

468
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:15,049
Rym: Oh, God, yes.

469
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:23,390
Rym: This show is about a radio-- a pop psychologist, radio star, and his brother in Seattle.

470
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:25,170
Scott: Okay.

471
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:26,609
Rym: Like, that is what this show is about.

472
00:33:27,835 --> 00:33:28,810
Scott: And they become demon lords.

473
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:30,949
Rym: So in this animation, they become demon lords.

474
00:33:32,072 --> 00:33:35,790
Rym: But this whole channel is just delightful, and I recommend you watch every video on this channel.

475
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:36,789
Rym: So what do you got?

476
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:37,337
Rym: All right.

477
00:33:39,371 --> 00:33:41,910
Scott: So I feel like Thundercats are making a move lately.

478
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:44,570
Scott: I still have to go watch that Thundercats Go show that came out.

479
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:45,547
Scott: I got to figure out where it's--.

480
00:33:45,771 --> 00:33:51,670
Rym: Oh, I want to watch it, too, because everyone said it's just Teen Titans Go, but for Thundercats, which you want to sell something to me.

481
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:52,750
Rym: That is exactly what I want.

482
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:55,290
Rym: I want the Teen Titans Go version of every popular media.

483
00:33:55,651 --> 00:33:59,250
Rym: And the more it angers people who like that original media, the better.

484
00:34:00,431 --> 00:34:04,450
Scott: But this video got posted on YouTube, like, just a few days ago, not very recently.

485
00:34:05,635 --> 00:34:10,110
Scott: And it's the Thundercats opening, except it's the exact same-- It's just not a parody or anything.

486
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:16,130
Scott: It's the exact same Thundercats opening as the original, only computer-generated graphics instead of hand-drawn.

487
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:25,389
Scott: So somebody basically just CG'd the opening instead of-- And it's not the most impressive you've ever seen, but it's like, "Oh, all right.

488
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:25,873
Scott: Pretty good.

489
00:34:26,178 --> 00:34:26,583
Scott: Pretty good

490
00:34:26,603 --> 00:34:26,826
Scott: job.".

491
00:34:27,873 --> 00:34:37,350
Scott: What makes this a thing of the day is that this was made not by some famous CG animator person, not like some Pixar person in their spare time.

492
00:34:37,469 --> 00:34:40,469
Scott: Obviously, if it was, it would look way, way better than it does.

493
00:34:40,811 --> 00:34:44,270
Rym: Well, if you raise the question, I thought I'd have a go at learning how to use 3D animation software.

494
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:48,830
Scott: I thought I'd go have a go at learning to use 3D animation software.

495
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:52,168
Scott: And you didn't do Pixar level, but look at that.

496
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:52,873
Scott: Right?

497
00:34:53,077 --> 00:34:53,569
Scott: Look at that.

498
00:34:53,931 --> 00:34:54,610
Rym: Not too bad.

499
00:34:54,630 --> 00:35:00,310
Scott: So this thing of the day is not-- And it's got hundreds of thousands of views, by the way, more than any GeekNights episode, right?

500
00:35:00,955 --> 00:35:02,649
Scott: Or GeekNights anything, for that matter.

501
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:03,751
Rym: Yeah.

502
00:35:04,013 --> 00:35:07,848
Rym: The GeekNights YouTube channel has like two million-ish views, I want to say.

503
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:08,632
Scott: No.

504
00:35:08,753 --> 00:35:11,890
Scott: Does any single video on the GeekNights YouTube channel have as many views as this?

505
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:11,971
Scott: No.

506
00:35:11,991 --> 00:35:13,909
Rym: A couple hundred thousand is like the max.

507
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:16,170
Rym: And those are not GeekNights episodes.

508
00:35:16,772 --> 00:35:17,889
Rym: That's dumb shit I made.

509
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:21,850
Rym: Like The Simpsons to handle the Brexit, or Gooney's Game of Thrones type shit.

510
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:29,110
Scott: So the point of this thing of the day is obviously, if you want to have a go at learning something new, right?

511
00:35:30,052 --> 00:35:32,610
Scott: Just pick a project, finish it.

512
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:36,063
Scott: It could even just be something like, "Oh, yeah, remake the Thundercats opener in

513
00:35:36,083 --> 00:35:36,345
Scott: CG."

514
00:35:37,213 --> 00:35:38,209
Scott: And just upload it.

515
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:39,089
Rym: Yeah, just do it.

516
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,469
Scott: And look at that.

517
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:42,790
Scott: You know, don't be like, "Oh, my crap is bad.

518
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:43,764
Scott: I'm not going to upload

519
00:35:43,805 --> 00:35:43,846
Scott: it.".

520
00:35:44,456 --> 00:35:49,869
Scott: This person-- You know, if I was this person, I'd be looking at what I output, and I'd be like, "This is back in.

521
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:50,434
Scott: I'll upload this.

522
00:35:50,454 --> 00:35:51,222
Scott: Look how crappy this

523
00:35:51,263 --> 00:35:51,303
Scott: is.".

524
00:35:52,311 --> 00:35:52,669
Scott: Right?

525
00:35:53,371 --> 00:35:54,709
Scott: But, you know, look what happens.

526
00:35:55,391 --> 00:35:56,189
Scott: So, you know.

527
00:35:56,391 --> 00:35:59,310
Scott: And they've never CG animated anything before, right?

528
00:35:59,431 --> 00:36:00,490
Scott: They just learn from nothing.

529
00:36:00,831 --> 00:36:02,249
Scott: Just like I learned cameras from nothing.

530
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:02,821
Rym: Yeah.

531
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:04,127
Rym: It's good stuff.

532
00:36:05,171 --> 00:36:05,689
Rym: So, yeah.

533
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:06,909
Rym: Meta moment, I guess.

534
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:08,650
Rym: Doing GeekNights from home.

535
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:13,009
Rym: We're a little bit busy trying to get panels uploaded, but it shouldn't disrupt us too much.

536
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:21,950
Rym: So look for us at the Crunchyroll Expo, and look for us at the Penny Arcade Expo Online, with Judge Anime by its cover, and where is the finish line?

537
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:23,236
Scott: Mm-hmm.

538
00:36:24,435 --> 00:36:25,530
Scott: Any other meta things?

539
00:36:26,195 --> 00:36:35,950
Scott: The Book Club book is still technically-- I can't even remember-- The Tale of Genji, the oldest novel to ever be written in human history.

540
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:41,830
Rym: We only stopped reading it because we're stuck at home and don't have any time to read like we normally would.

541
00:36:42,073 --> 00:36:42,690
Scott: I had a feeling.

542
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:46,990
Scott: I had this feeling in my gut, like, "Must-read fantasy novel," right?

543
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:47,808
Scott: Or sci-fi novel.

544
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:52,466
Scott: Because it's summer, and it's like-- But there was no beach to go to to read one, and I still haven't read one.

545
00:36:53,173 --> 00:36:53,930
Rym: Actually, I should check.

546
00:36:54,031 --> 00:36:56,990
Rym: I hope a new R. Scott Becker book didn't come out, because I definitely don't--.

547
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:59,108
Rym: It's not like I'm going to read anything right now.

548
00:37:00,453 --> 00:37:01,023
Scott: Well, maybe.

549
00:37:01,084 --> 00:37:01,389
Scott: Who knows?

550
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:06,830
Rym: So, yeah, just type the word "Geeknights" into Google, and you'll find our stuff.

551
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:16,570
Rym: Come to the forum, but more importantly, find somewhere in the forum a link to our Discord, the official unofficial, but, yeah, it's official, Geeknights Discord, because it's hopping more and more.

552
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:22,410
Rym: We've been playing train games with the listener, so you could join us and play some weird train games and stuff.

553
00:37:23,313 --> 00:37:25,510
Scott: I will give you personal train game teaching lessons.

554
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:34,149
Rym: Scott literally trained the listener in how to play 18XX, 1846, and then we played it together, the three of us, and it was a good time.

555
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:35,444
Rym: Yeah.

556
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:36,063
Scott: Yeah.

557
00:37:36,996 --> 00:37:44,249
Scott: So, come on down to-- If you have never-- If this is somehow the first Geeknights thing you've ever seen, you don't know who the hell we are, just Google for "Geeknights" and find us.

558
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,569
Scott: We're, like, you know, a lot of stuff.

559
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:46,081
Rym: Yep.

560
00:37:46,672 --> 00:37:50,685
Rym: The only thing that won't show up that much is our website, because we're working on it.

561
00:37:50,725 --> 00:37:51,190
Rym: Don't worry.

562
00:37:51,659 --> 00:37:52,189
Scott: I'm working slowly.

563
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:53,809
Rym: Yeah, bit by bit.

564
00:37:54,050 --> 00:38:02,787
Scott: If you know somebody who is really good at HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and wants to work on the Geeknights website, contact me.

565
00:38:03,011 --> 00:38:03,429
Scott: Yeah, we'll pay.

566
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:06,650
Scott: If you know someone-- Yeah, we're paying money for this, obviously.

567
00:38:07,277 --> 00:38:07,669
Scott: Good money.

568
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:14,570
Scott: So, if you know someone or are someone, right, contact me or refer them to me, and we'll get talking.

569
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:15,042
Rym: Yep.

570
00:38:15,311 --> 00:38:24,810
Rym: And if you want us to appear at a panel or something, like, if there's a convention, and you want us to, like, be at that convention online doing panels, contact me, and we'll sort out those details.

571
00:38:25,571 --> 00:38:33,120
Rym: Also, if you think you are the kind of person who should be a guest on Geeknights, because you made a game or an anime or something, like, we're working out.

572
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,190
Rym: We got a pipeline set up.

573
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:36,860
Rym: We're going to do some interviews soon with some people, but email me.

574
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:37,609
Rym: I'll take care of that.

575
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:38,528
Rym: Maybe we'll make it happen.

576
00:38:39,932 --> 00:38:43,930
Scott: Yeah, but not, you know, people who are just shamelessly shilling their stuff, right?

577
00:38:44,111 --> 00:38:45,310
Scott: We're not interested, right?

578
00:38:45,411 --> 00:38:47,610
Scott: We're interested in, like, actual human beings.

579
00:38:47,871 --> 00:38:48,736
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

580
00:38:48,857 --> 00:38:51,270
Rym: We get a lot of those requests that we don't respond to.

581
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:59,570
Scott: Not those, you get random email, like, so-and-so that doesn't even know who you are wrote a book and sent an email to every podcast in the whole world trying to appear on podcasts.

582
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:00,588
Scott: It's like, no.

583
00:39:01,471 --> 00:39:05,203
Scott: So-and-so who saw you at a convention once is working on a video game.

584
00:39:05,243 --> 00:39:06,170
Scott: It's like, yes, okay.

585
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:07,146
Scott: Let's do it.

586
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:08,248
Scott: So, yeah.

587
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:26,886
Rym: Wow, Scott, I've been watching and reading a lot of different manga and comics and animation lately, so we figured we each talk about something we've read or watched recently, and I have to avoid talking about Kipo because I've talked about it in the opening part of the show, like, four or five times, and it's great, but I think I'll just have to wait for Scott

588
00:39:26,926 --> 00:39:27,149
Scott: to watch it.

589
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:28,849
Scott: I don't remember you talking about it even one time.

590
00:39:29,513 --> 00:39:29,857
Rym: Ah, okay.

591
00:39:29,897 --> 00:39:30,039
Rym: Wow.

592
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:32,079
Rym: You should watch it.

593
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:32,690
Rym: It's actually pretty good.

594
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:33,267
Rym: It's short, too.

595
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:35,570
Rym: There's two pretty short seasons.

596
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:36,550
Rym: It's just on Netflix.

597
00:39:37,773 --> 00:39:38,249
Rym: I don't know.

598
00:39:38,932 --> 00:39:39,609
Rym: It's a pretty good show.

599
00:39:39,991 --> 00:39:42,570
Rym: It could theoretically be in the Giveyate universe.

600
00:39:43,073 --> 00:39:44,589
Rym: That actually tracks pretty well.

601
00:39:45,742 --> 00:39:45,990
Scott: Uh-oh.

602
00:39:46,511 --> 00:39:48,458
Scott: All right, so which way are we going to talk about Giveyate?

603
00:39:48,498 --> 00:39:49,308
Scott: first or Devil May?

604
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:51,670
Rym: We could do Givyater because it's...

605
00:39:52,411 --> 00:39:52,552
Scott: So,

606
00:39:53,296 --> 00:40:18,209
Rym: in the not yet published Judge Anime by its Cover panel, this was an upcoming anime, so we judged it, so if you want to hear what we thought it was going to be like, check us out at the Crunchyroll Expo, but based on the images that we saw, to paraphrase what we said, it looks like a bunch of characters who are very anime in a Fist of the North Star-looking world fighting demons together.

607
00:40:19,492 --> 00:40:19,855
Scott: All right.

608
00:40:20,178 --> 00:40:21,610
Scott: That's not immediately bad.

609
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:32,529
Rym: Yeah, and I figure, like, the way we looked at the show, the worst-case scenario is it is just a shounen fighting show, meaning it'll be four episodes of good stuff, and then it'll just be shounen fighting till the end.

610
00:40:33,031 --> 00:40:37,381
Rym: So, uh, I actually watched the first two episodes of this show, and you know what?

611
00:40:37,664 --> 00:40:38,150
Rym: It's all right.

612
00:40:38,672 --> 00:40:40,143
Rym: It is, but it took a twist.

613
00:40:40,163 --> 00:40:41,029
Rym: I'm going to spoil something.

614
00:40:42,693 --> 00:40:45,770
Rym: It is more like Gasaraki than I expected.

615
00:40:46,873 --> 00:40:49,870
Scott: No, that's a positive for me, but probably negative for everyone else in the world.

616
00:40:50,251 --> 00:40:50,574
Rym: Right?

617
00:40:50,594 --> 00:40:55,722
Rym: I feel like you, me, and our friend Pete are the only people on Earth who watched Gasaraki to the end and thought, "You know what?

618
00:40:55,743 --> 00:40:56,068
Scott: I like that

619
00:40:56,088 --> 00:40:56,189
Scott: show.".

620
00:40:56,271 --> 00:40:56,908
Scott: Alex watched it, I think.

621
00:40:57,511 --> 00:40:59,510
Rym: Yeah, but I don't think Alex liked it as much as we did.

622
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:00,049
Rym: I don't remember.

623
00:41:01,574 --> 00:41:03,930
Rym: I don't know if anyone liked it except us, our little group.

624
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:13,885
Rym: All I remember is that that show is 24 episodes of buildup for a payoff that for some reason hit with us but did not hit with anyone else on Earth.

625
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:15,219
Scott: Mm-hmm.

626
00:41:16,131 --> 00:41:20,410
Rym: But there was a moment in that show, I guess spoilers, because who's watched Gasaraki?

627
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:23,730
Rym: None of you are going to watch Gasaraki if you haven't already watched Gasaraki.

628
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:32,089
Rym: Gasaraki just goes and goes and goes, and then there's an episode, like episode 13, where the opener's different, and it's just a different fucking show.

629
00:41:33,912 --> 00:41:38,350
Rym: That happens in the middle of the first episode of Gibiate or Gibiate.

630
00:41:39,193 --> 00:41:45,290
Rym: So Gibiate starts with a girl, and she's in an apartment in a Mad Max world, and she's got a camcorder.

631
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:53,090
Rym: It's funny because you see the camcorder, and it says it's a 16K resolution camcorder, clearly near future style.

632
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:54,116
Scott: Cool.

633
00:41:54,991 --> 00:41:57,949
Rym: It's like the year 2030-something, and she's like, "I'm making this video.

634
00:41:58,451 --> 00:42:02,739
Rym: I don't know if anyone will ever see it, but I just want people to know that I was here and that we

635
00:42:02,799 --> 00:42:03,223
Rym: tried.".

636
00:42:04,052 --> 00:42:21,678
Rym: And you get this story of like, there was a virus that appeared, and it turns the Gibi-er virus, and it turns people into Gibiates, which are basically zombie monsters, like giant animal monster that attacks people, and that caused an apocalypse and destroyed the world, and there's humans left over trying to find a cure for this disease.

637
00:42:21,779 --> 00:42:22,610
Rym: Like, that's the plot.

638
00:42:24,233 --> 00:42:43,424
Rym: Like, five minutes in, the show then cuts to the year 1600, like Tokugawa, and these samurai, and there's these two samurai on a boat, and one of them's like, "Oh, I know who you are," and the other one's like, "Oh, yeah, I know who you are, too,".

639
00:42:43,444 --> 00:42:45,943
Rym: and the first one's like, "So, why did you get

640
00:42:46,023 --> 00:42:46,487
Rym: exiled?".

641
00:42:47,112 --> 00:42:51,696
Rym: And then, like, he tells his story, and the other one's like, "Oh, yeah, so I got exiled because of...".

642
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:52,970
Rym: and he tells his story.

643
00:42:53,291 --> 00:43:04,566
Rym: So, we've got a ninja and a samurai on a boat in, like, 1600, leaving Edo because they have both been exiled for reasons, and there's a whole, like, backstory and plot there.

644
00:43:07,013 --> 00:43:08,528
Rym: And that's where the show starts.

645
00:43:09,832 --> 00:43:11,548
Rym: But, basically, those two characters...

646
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:13,208
Scott: It actually kind of makes me want to watch it.

647
00:43:14,051 --> 00:43:17,569
Rym: So, that did make me want to watch it, and I do kind of want to watch more.

648
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:29,085
Rym: However, I looked online, just to get a link for this episode, because there's, like, seven episodes of the show out so far, and the show has mostly one-star reviews, and people seem to absolutely hate it.

649
00:43:30,495 --> 00:43:31,001
Scott: All right.

650
00:43:31,122 --> 00:43:33,730
Rym: Like, the reviews are resoundingly bad.

651
00:43:34,154 --> 00:43:40,862
Rym: on every website that I've gone to, and the crazy part is, they're even, they're, like, the reviews are all, like, one-star.

652
00:43:40,942 --> 00:43:43,590
Rym: Like, the majority of the reviews everywhere for this anime are one-star.

653
00:43:43,951 --> 00:43:46,983
Scott: Every review is either going to be one-star or five-star, right?

654
00:43:47,084 --> 00:43:48,458
Scott: Maybe sometimes four-star.

655
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:50,619
Scott: Two and three basically don't get used very often.

656
00:43:52,511 --> 00:43:54,136
Scott: Especially, two is almost never used.

657
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:59,309
Rym: On Crunchyroll, six-fives, seven-fours, nine-threes, thirteen-twos, thirty-four-ones.

658
00:44:01,201 --> 00:44:04,219
Rym: On MyAnimeList, there's, like, five-thousand reviews.

659
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,430
Rym: It's the same distribution.

660
00:44:05,871 --> 00:44:06,628
Rym: Almost all ones.

661
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:09,350
Rym: But, the show's not that bad.

662
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:11,169
Rym: Like, the show's not great.

663
00:44:11,511 --> 00:44:18,987
Rym: Like, maybe in the later episodes, like, the show Peter's Outer gets boring or something, but this is not a one-star anime, for the love of God.

664
00:44:19,371 --> 00:44:21,942
Rym: This show feels so anime.

665
00:44:21,982 --> 00:44:26,810
Rym: It feels like Fushigi Yugi or, like, whatever the show's like.

666
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:35,536
Rym: It feels like the show that would be the one everyone's cosplaying as and popular at an Otakon where the nerds like us are like, "Oh, that show's overrated.

667
00:44:35,617 --> 00:44:36,830
Rym: I'm not that interested in that

668
00:44:36,931 --> 00:44:37,112
Rym: show.".

669
00:44:37,153 --> 00:44:38,869
Rym: Like, it feels like that kind of show.

670
00:44:39,451 --> 00:44:42,569
Rym: I can't understand why people hate this show so much.

671
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:45,909
Rym: They mostly say it's boring, so it might actually be good.

672
00:44:47,834 --> 00:44:48,262
Scott: Oh, maybe.

673
00:44:48,425 --> 00:44:49,889
Scott: You did say it was Gasaraki-esque.

674
00:44:50,071 --> 00:44:50,314
Scott: Yup.

675
00:44:50,839 --> 00:44:51,849
Rym: But, uh, yeah.

676
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:56,150
Rym: So, based on what I've seen, I'm actually gonna keep watching this show.

677
00:44:56,350 --> 00:45:11,390
Rym: Like, it's... I'm intrigued by the premise a little bit, and I want to see why we have these samurai from 1600 in the year 2038 fighting a disease that causes humans to turn into monsters.

678
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:12,312
Rym: And...

679
00:45:12,332 --> 00:45:19,707
Scott: Well, I imagine that you will, uh, you know, the samurais will be somehow near the origin of the disease, right?

680
00:45:19,788 --> 00:45:19,930
Scott: Yup.

681
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:23,059
Scott: And you'll see the disease's effect all throughout history.

682
00:45:23,503 --> 00:45:32,580
Scott: And that way, you know, setting up a story like that allows you to create new content at any point in history of like, "Oh, here's gibiates in the 1800s.

683
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,204
Scott: Here's gibiates in the 2030s," right?

684
00:45:35,224 --> 00:45:37,830
Scott: It's like, you have a huge span of time.

685
00:45:37,970 --> 00:45:42,802
Scott: You can just make up some characters in a different setting and throw in the gibiates and you're good to go.

686
00:45:42,822 --> 00:45:51,969
Rym: I mean, Madoka Magica did that in a certain scene near the end where we saw a series of vignettes from different magical girls throughout history.

687
00:45:53,176 --> 00:45:53,749
Scott: Yeah, that's true.

688
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:59,289
Rym: So yeah, this show seems like, I feel like this show's gonna end up being like a three-star okay show.

689
00:45:59,873 --> 00:46:08,779
Rym: And I really don't understand the weird vitriol in the reviews of the show because I have seen way worse shows that have higher ratings than this.

690
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:16,331
Scott: The only thing I can think is since you've only seen two episodes, something could be coming up in an episode up ahead that you will be like, "Oh God, one

691
00:46:16,372 --> 00:46:16,756
Scott: star.".

692
00:46:17,221 --> 00:46:24,404
Rym: Yep, it seems though like most of the complaints are that it's boring or people don't like the CG of the monsters because they look weird.

693
00:46:26,594 --> 00:46:30,129
Rym: That seems to be like the only things people are actually saying about the show.

694
00:46:30,532 --> 00:46:32,588
Rym: It's boring and I don't like the way the monsters look.

695
00:46:34,012 --> 00:46:36,110
Scott: Okay, should I talk about Devilman now?

696
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:37,709
Rym: Yeah, let's talk about the Devilman.

697
00:46:38,552 --> 00:46:41,628
Scott: Alright, so who published this here?

698
00:46:42,485 --> 00:46:44,639
Scott: Alright, Seven Seas.

699
00:46:44,801 --> 00:46:50,237
Scott: So Seven Seas published these two volumes, the classic collection Devilman by Gonagai.

700
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:59,103
Scott: So it's two big-ass books collecting literally all of the original Gonagai Devilman manga, right?

701
00:46:59,164 --> 00:47:00,764
Scott: It's just two books, that's it.

702
00:47:02,233 --> 00:47:10,154
Scott: So if you perhaps watch the amazing, excellent anime Devilman Crybaby, which we did talk about on this show I think?

703
00:47:10,236 --> 00:47:10,802
Rym: Pretty sure we did.

704
00:47:11,126 --> 00:47:11,309
Scott: Yes.

705
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:12,304
Scott: Yeah.

706
00:47:13,871 --> 00:47:17,108
Rym: I don't think we finished it when we talked about it, but we did talk about it.

707
00:47:18,231 --> 00:47:18,536
Scott: Oh, okay.

708
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:19,269
Scott: I finished it.

709
00:47:19,671 --> 00:47:23,650
Scott: You can go back and read the original Devilman manga now in English, no problem.

710
00:47:24,553 --> 00:47:25,768
Scott: So I read the whole freaking thing.

711
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:37,810
Scott: And first of all, it was a lot more similar to, I was under the impression watching Devilman Crybaby that it was quite a large departure from the original Devilman, right?

712
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:40,490
Scott: With only the base sort of intact.

713
00:47:41,533 --> 00:47:48,155
Scott: No, the original Devilman is much more in line with Devilman Crybaby than I had any idea.

714
00:47:48,175 --> 00:47:49,205
Scott: Interesting.

715
00:47:49,225 --> 00:47:50,850
Rym: That actually makes me want to read this manga.

716
00:47:52,276 --> 00:47:52,609
Scott: It should.

717
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:57,427
Scott: Something else, even though it's big books, there's only two volumes of this.

718
00:47:58,412 --> 00:48:02,090
Scott: So there's actually a second manga called New Chin Devilman.

719
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:03,167
Scott: New Devilman, right?

720
00:48:04,252 --> 00:48:15,345
Scott: And in that separate manga that is not part of the original Devilman series, Devilman goes on adventures throughout history to fight demons in various places.

721
00:48:15,406 --> 00:48:17,887
Scott: So it's like, go to Rome and fight demons or whatever, right?

722
00:48:19,238 --> 00:48:27,750
Scott: And normally, I guess originally that was published separately, but here they've been sort of combined and mixed together a little bit, the chapters.

723
00:48:28,351 --> 00:48:32,194
Scott: So you're reading and you're going through the story and suddenly it's like Devilman in Rome.

724
00:48:32,214 --> 00:48:34,193
Scott: And it's like, what's going on here?

725
00:48:34,334 --> 00:48:36,435
Scott: And then the next chapter goes back to the plot again.

726
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:38,415
Scott: And you're like, huh, what's up with that?

727
00:48:38,515 --> 00:48:40,677
Scott: Why was that random chapter in here?

728
00:48:40,981 --> 00:48:47,607
Scott: But I researched, yeah, when they published these two giant volumes, they interspersed Shin Devilman chapters in it.

729
00:48:49,173 --> 00:48:49,770
Scott: So that's a thing.

730
00:48:50,273 --> 00:48:53,630
Scott: And that is making these books fatter, right?

731
00:48:53,951 --> 00:48:58,617
Scott: So the parts of these books, the parts of these books that are just regular.

732
00:48:58,657 --> 00:49:02,374
Scott: Devilman is still most of it, but not all of it, right?

733
00:49:02,778 --> 00:49:05,289
Scott: So the original Devilman manga is not long.

734
00:49:06,051 --> 00:49:11,910
Scott: It's not very long and it contains basically almost, pretty much that whole story you saw in Shin Devilman.

735
00:49:12,431 --> 00:49:15,504
Scott: If you haven't seen Shin Devilman, watch it or read this first.

736
00:49:15,544 --> 00:49:16,615
Scott: I don't think it matters too much.

737
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:18,697
Scott: It contains the whole Devilman storyline.

738
00:49:19,606 --> 00:49:24,637
Scott: It's such few chapters and that lets you know the pace of Devilman is fast.

739
00:49:24,819 --> 00:49:27,424
Scott: It is a fast story, right?

740
00:49:27,728 --> 00:49:29,808
Scott: It blitzes through, right?

741
00:49:29,828 --> 00:49:31,282
Scott: If there's a fight, it's self-contained.

742
00:49:32,171 --> 00:49:35,139
Scott: in one chapter, Devilman beats some evil demon, boom.

743
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:37,630
Rym: So it's the literal opposite of One Piece or Kaiji.

744
00:49:38,973 --> 00:49:41,584
Scott: Oh yeah, Devilman just blitzes right through the enemies.

745
00:49:41,907 --> 00:49:46,028
Scott: He's just charging towards the, it's like he's in a rush to get to the end, right?

746
00:49:47,363 --> 00:49:56,435
Scott: And because it's so short, it's constantly referenced, the whole story stays with you the whole time, right?

747
00:49:56,476 --> 00:50:03,044
Scott: You're not like, we're reading One Piece, you'll be like, you know, the events of the beginning of One Piece, right?

748
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:09,243
Scott: And like sort of start to like not be as relevant when you're a hundred volumes in, right?

749
00:50:09,648 --> 00:50:11,327
Rym: But there's like four pieces now.

750
00:50:12,972 --> 00:50:13,236
Scott: Right.

751
00:50:13,297 --> 00:50:22,355
Scott: Throughout the whole story of Devilman, every time they add something new, all the previous things like continue to be carried along right up to the end, right?

752
00:50:22,657 --> 00:50:33,909
Scott: So it's a very well-constructed story and that like every single thing they add is, there's no like wasted, even though it's going fast, nothing is wasted or extraneous or unnecessary, right?

753
00:50:33,949 --> 00:50:40,865
Scott: It's like every step in the plot has meaning and relevance and continues to have meaning and relevance right up to the finale.

754
00:50:42,192 --> 00:50:49,049
Scott: Of course, if you don't know, Devilman is pretty extremely and not safe for life.

755
00:50:50,033 --> 00:50:58,042
Rym: Yeah, it's not like apocalypse zero level, but it's but it's close.

756
00:51:01,544 --> 00:51:12,679
Scott: So on the one hand, visually right, it's not visually disturbing, even though there is lots of gore and violence and sexy, gory violence right?

757
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:15,526
Scott: It's like I don't get nauseous looking at the illustrations of Devilman.

758
00:51:15,567 --> 00:51:16,576
Scott: They're actually pretty awesome.

759
00:51:16,597 --> 00:51:19,088
Rym: True, because apocalypse zero is gross in that way too.

760
00:51:20,033 --> 00:51:29,500
Scott: Right, but what is being depicted is horrifying often frequently, but I think in a way, you know, obviously it's going to guy, right?

761
00:51:29,541 --> 00:51:30,834
Scott: That's what going to guy's all about.

762
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:41,561
Scott: But at the same, you know, sex and violence, but at the same time, I think it serves the story because it's about like literal demons, right?

763
00:51:41,702 --> 00:51:43,884
Scott: And it's like, it's hellish, literally hellish.

764
00:51:44,389 --> 00:51:47,864
Scott: And it's like, yeah, that's the kind of shit that's going on in hell, right?

765
00:51:48,227 --> 00:51:48,510
Scott: Crazy.

766
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:55,441
Rym: Well, you know what, like an eccentric family, like when the, when the one character goes to hell for a little while and hell is hellish.

767
00:51:55,865 --> 00:51:56,370
Rym: Hell sucks.

768
00:51:56,870 --> 00:51:57,102
Scott: Yeah.

769
00:51:58,192 --> 00:52:01,604
Scott: It's, you know, this is a hell on earth scenario here, right?

770
00:52:01,624 --> 00:52:06,876
Scott: So it's I don't think it's in a, it's not inappropriate sex and violence.

771
00:52:07,562 --> 00:52:09,118
Scott: It's just be aware that it's there.

772
00:52:09,361 --> 00:52:11,387
Scott: Don't read it if you don't want to see that.

773
00:52:12,771 --> 00:52:18,588
Scott: Don't have children read Devilman in, I guess, I don't know how old children were supposed to be reading Devilman in Japan.

774
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:20,712
Rym: Yeah.

775
00:52:21,217 --> 00:52:22,309
Scott: But yeah, that's the thing.

776
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:30,835
Scott: But yeah, it is, you know, if you can get past the extreme sex and violence and also, you know, sexism and things.

777
00:52:31,279 --> 00:52:33,339
Scott: It's actually a pretty compelling story.

778
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:42,575
Scott: You can see that same, most of that same compelling story in Devilman Crybaby and I guess this is the original Devilman anime as well, I assume also has the same story.

779
00:52:42,595 --> 00:52:43,688
Scott: I haven't watched that.

780
00:52:45,477 --> 00:53:01,403
Scott: But the only thing that really stood out to me as kind of meh is that there's a storyline towards the end where Devilman goes around the earth collecting the other Devilmen and creating like a fighting force of Devilmen to fight the demons, right?

781
00:53:01,464 --> 00:53:03,569
Scott: Because before then he's all on his own, right?

782
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:09,489
Scott: And that was, you know, the pace of the thing is so fast.

783
00:53:10,093 --> 00:53:13,563
Scott: That felt sort of like a rushed insert thing.

784
00:53:13,946 --> 00:53:16,817
Scott: It wasn't meaningless or wrong.

785
00:53:16,837 --> 00:53:26,871
Scott: It just felt like it was like the manga was about to end and rather than end it, they came up with this idea of a way to extend it a little bit more, right?

786
00:53:27,499 --> 00:53:29,422
Scott: And then they threw that in there and then they ended it.

787
00:53:30,893 --> 00:53:35,423
Scott: So that was, because it's like they add a bunch of characters that get barely any screen time, right?

788
00:53:35,524 --> 00:53:38,468
Scott: And it's like it's kind of a little bit awkward in there.

789
00:53:40,061 --> 00:53:42,755
Scott: But yeah, if you don't know, I'll just summarize the story pretty quickly.

790
00:53:42,775 --> 00:53:49,540
Scott: There's a kid and his friend and his friend is basically like, "Hey, let me show you something

791
00:53:49,581 --> 00:53:49,803
Scott: cool.".

792
00:53:50,350 --> 00:53:51,490
Rym: Hey kid, want to see a dead body?

793
00:53:52,912 --> 00:53:53,769
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

794
00:53:56,854 --> 00:53:58,270
Scott: that's the start of the story, right?

795
00:53:58,430 --> 00:53:59,969
Scott: Hey kid, you want to see this cool thing?

796
00:54:01,173 --> 00:54:09,329
Scott: And then he's possessed by not just demons but like the most ridiculous powerful demon there is, right?

797
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:16,969
Scott: And he finds out that like, yeah, actually that there's demons on Earth and they're trying to come back and get rid of all the people.

798
00:54:17,893 --> 00:54:23,069
Scott: But because you've been possessed by a demon, you can fight back against them with their own, you know, fight fire with fire.

799
00:54:23,291 --> 00:54:25,669
Rym: You know, that's very similar to the plot of Evangelion.

800
00:54:27,813 --> 00:54:27,995
Scott: Yep.

801
00:54:28,845 --> 00:54:34,118
Scott: So yeah, I guess in some ways yes, but in some ways no.

802
00:54:34,381 --> 00:54:34,664
Rym: Yeah.

803
00:54:34,988 --> 00:54:39,593
Rym: Well, in the sense that I guess if you haven't seen Evangelion, somehow what are the Evas made of?

804
00:54:40,747 --> 00:54:42,259
Scott: Yeah, but sure.

805
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:52,643
Scott: But yeah, Double Men is a classic of Gonagai, you know, popular, you know, super important manga anime for the history of anime.

806
00:54:52,946 --> 00:54:57,350
Scott: If you've never experienced any Gonagai, this might be the one to experience.

807
00:54:57,471 --> 00:55:07,330
Scott: I'd say like you can go for Mazinger Z to get a Gonagai experience, but you won't understand the sexy violence of Gonagai if you do that, right?

808
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:15,270
Scott: Not that there's none in Mazinger, but you know, this is really like I think the core of who Gonagai is, right?

809
00:55:15,391 --> 00:55:16,360
Scott: Is this manga.

810
00:55:16,966 --> 00:55:19,349
Scott: So check it out or not.

811
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:20,601
Scott: And it's only two volumes.

812
00:55:20,621 --> 00:55:22,803
Scott: You can probably get them at the library, return them.

813
00:55:22,964 --> 00:55:26,479
Rym: I just search for it on Amazon and Amazon itself is sold out.

814
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:29,050
Rym: You can only buy a used Okay.

815
00:55:29,290 --> 00:55:30,722
Scott: A hardcover, I guess.

816
00:55:30,823 --> 00:55:32,054
Rym: Is there a softcover version?

817
00:55:32,458 --> 00:55:34,134
Scott: I have two hardcover volumes.

818
00:55:34,215 --> 00:55:38,557
Rym: I do not believe they are there for sale for like 50 bucks each used on Amazon.

819
00:55:39,022 --> 00:55:39,809
Scott: Oh, can't have mine.

820
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:40,417
Rym: Yeah.

821
00:55:40,458 --> 00:55:40,886
Rym: These are mine.

822
00:55:42,615 --> 00:55:42,920
Scott: All right.

823
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:44,135
Scott: So that's that's Devilman.

824
00:55:44,377 --> 00:55:45,750
Scott: Is he man or Deville?

825
00:55:52,237 --> 00:55:54,449
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

826
00:55:54,489 --> 00:55:59,460

Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

833
00:56:25,111 --> 00:56:35,017
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights are Alan Joyce having the nickel, Marty Greenidge is like a dude, Guy Jartobshan, Graham Finch, you are the key to my heart.

00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:53,767
Rym: Yep, we put together a new pipeline for the PAX panel.

837
00:56:53,787 --> 00:56:54,558
Rym: It's looking pretty good.

838
00:56:55,763 --> 00:56:58,919
Rym: This is still more of a pain in the ass than we anticipated, but we're getting better at it.

839
00:56:59,341 --> 00:57:03,499
Rym: So for now, I leave you with something that is very relevant to what we just talked about today.

840
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:51,240
Rym: [music].
