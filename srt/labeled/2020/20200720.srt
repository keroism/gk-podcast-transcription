1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,196
Rym: It's Monday July 20th 2020.

2
00:00:10,196 --> 00:00:12,542
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:12,823 --> 00:00:18,670
Rym: tonight We're talking about bud bounties and responsible disclosure.

4
00:00:20,531 --> 00:00:21,567
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:23,251 --> 00:00:30,354
Rym: So I guess bike nights is back cuz we went on a long bike ride this weekend in the in the heat wave Wave.

6
00:00:30,615 --> 00:00:31,098
Rym: no, it's funny.

7
00:00:31,138 --> 00:00:39,190
Rym: I looked at the weather and I was like, alright, it's gonna be like 80 Something when we start and it'll be 95 96 like when we're toward the end of the run.

8
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,093
Rym: So I can deal with that.

9
00:00:40,836 --> 00:00:42,020
Rym: and it was super hot.

10
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,586
Rym: The heat index was like a hundred and five.

11
00:00:43,606 --> 00:00:55,269
Rym: It's a good ride but Cars are starting to creep into New York City again as things start to open up and the ozone Was back up into the orange during the hundred and five heat index.

12
00:00:56,172 --> 00:00:57,943
Rym: Yeah, so we only biked like 40 over.

13
00:00:57,963 --> 00:00:59,110
Scott: you leave the city, right?

14
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,356
Scott: You know if you don't stay in the city This time.

15
00:01:01,396 --> 00:01:03,890
Rym: we did a loop down Rockaway and back so we were in Queens.

16
00:01:04,691 --> 00:01:06,981
Scott: Oh, oh you had near where all the the crazy bad people are.

17
00:01:07,222 --> 00:01:07,423
Rym: Yep.

18
00:01:07,624 --> 00:01:08,990
Rym: We skirted the side of the beach.

19
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:12,505
Rym: We could see the chaos over the like on the boardwalk and steered clear of it.

20
00:01:12,525 --> 00:01:14,877
Scott: I Don't know what people are thinking.

21
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:18,937
Rym: the good news is though because it was so hot There really wasn't anyone anywhere else.

22
00:01:18,957 --> 00:01:20,282
Rym: Like we didn't really encounter people.

23
00:01:20,382 --> 00:01:20,984
Rym: It was pretty great.

24
00:01:21,687 --> 00:01:28,470
Rym: But uh, So yeah, it was 105 with the heat index and the ozone was way higher than I expected.

25
00:01:29,011 --> 00:01:36,030
Rym: So, uh, this might only be in a 40-mile ride a little bit tired in that last 10 miles on the way home on Queens Boulevard.

26
00:01:37,111 --> 00:01:45,405
Scott: No, you know biking always takes at least 10 degrees off whatever the actual temperature is up to a point Once the temperature is approaching human body temperature.

27
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:46,048
Rym: It does not.

28
00:01:47,152 --> 00:01:51,266
Scott: Hey, you got like a fan blowing on your body the whole fans blowing on your body.

29
00:01:51,687 --> 00:01:59,624
Rym: in certain environments Like where the air temperature is higher than body temperature and also as I humidity can actually increase your body temperature as opposed to decreasing it.

30
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:09,009
Rym: It's evaporating the sweat off your body if it's too humid because then the Evaporation doesn't actually happen fast enough and you end up increasing your body temperature.

31
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:11,376
Scott: It's not.

32
00:02:11,437 --> 00:02:11,800
Scott: it's fine.

33
00:02:11,921 --> 00:02:12,930
Rym: It's a rare situation.

34
00:02:13,191 --> 00:02:15,482
Rym: Very few people have to worry about that, but it can't happen.

35
00:02:16,085 --> 00:02:16,969
Scott: never had that happen.

36
00:02:17,852 --> 00:02:20,583
Rym: So, uh, yeah, what's up before we get into the tech news?

37
00:02:20,643 --> 00:02:23,815
Rym: Cuz there is a big big big tech news We're gonna talk about at length.

38
00:02:23,975 --> 00:02:25,681
Scott: Is there anything up at all?

39
00:02:25,701 --> 00:02:28,070
Scott: I was sitting in the house not going anywhere.

40
00:02:28,371 --> 00:02:30,938
Scott: Yeah, I guess I'll go biking next weekend.

41
00:02:31,059 --> 00:02:32,423
Rym: We're gonna do another night bike.

42
00:02:32,463 --> 00:02:33,325
Rym: I think on Friday.

43
00:02:33,345 --> 00:02:34,910
Scott: No, good luck with that.

44
00:02:35,111 --> 00:02:36,097
Rym: Why it's great night.

45
00:02:36,117 --> 00:02:38,310
Rym: biking is like the best way to get out during all this.

46
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,279
Scott: You just can't go anywhere distant at night thing.

47
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:42,102
Scott: Everything's closed.

48
00:02:42,483 --> 00:02:44,570
Rym: Yeah, well I could like the loop we just did we could do again.

49
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:45,959
Rym: There's no bridges that are blocked.

50
00:02:45,979 --> 00:02:50,920
Scott: I Don't know actually if the bridge has a gate on it.

51
00:02:51,221 --> 00:02:57,609
Rym: I looked there in the gate that can be pulled up is Trivial to just like toss your bike over like it's not even that high.

52
00:02:58,472 --> 00:03:00,230
Scott: Yeah, some of them have like doors that close.

53
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:03,501
Rym: Some of them like the I don't like.

54
00:03:03,521 --> 00:03:06,390
Rym: the RFK gets sealed up pretty tight on the Randall's Island side.

55
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:08,127
Rym: It looks like like I don't want to have to deal with that.

56
00:03:09,005 --> 00:03:09,672
Scott: Yeah this also.

57
00:03:09,712 --> 00:03:15,780
Scott: sometimes you have to go to an area where it's like you don't want to go there in the dark because a car will Get you or a crazy person.

58
00:03:15,901 --> 00:03:17,390
Rym: Yeah, we picked some routes that are good.

59
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,150
Rym: The cool thing is Manhattan is basically a complete ghost town at night.

60
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:25,662
Rym: So if we go out biking at like 11 o'clock at night Times Square or like any like Second Avenue.

61
00:03:25,903 --> 00:03:27,870
Rym: just no cars completely empty.

62
00:03:28,312 --> 00:03:31,205
Rym: You can just bike across to the west side do the loop around Manhattan.

63
00:03:31,225 --> 00:03:32,330
Scott: Yeah, that's the thing.

64
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:37,148
Scott: It's like it's so empty rope But when a car does come it's probably some crazy person zooming down the road.

65
00:03:37,168 --> 00:03:39,549
Scott: like you know We're having a fun time on the empty road in a car.

66
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:40,755
Rym: Yeah, you know we ran into you.

67
00:03:40,775 --> 00:03:43,730
Rym: last time was that gang of people on four-wheelers and ATVs.

68
00:03:44,431 --> 00:03:47,250
Rym: Yeah, you gotta watch out for that, but they stuck to the west side highway.

69
00:03:47,512 --> 00:03:49,630
Rym: So we were able to avoid them by staying in the bike path.

70
00:03:49,871 --> 00:03:53,088
Rym: They only drove into the bike path when they were ready to have a party in the bike path.

71
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,994
Rym: hmm All right.

72
00:03:56,034 --> 00:04:01,161
Rym: So yeah Twitter if you didn't notice Some weird happened the other day.

73
00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:08,790
Rym: a bunch of rich shit heads Suddenly all tweeted that they're gonna give back to the community and a whole bunch of people smartly said that's a hack.

74
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:22,329
Rym: There is no way any of those people would have said those words and the night But that they all posted was send bitcoins here and I will send you back Twice as many bitcoins now regardless of a Twitter hack.

75
00:04:23,356 --> 00:04:26,188
Rym: how Could anyone fall for that?

76
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:27,333
Scott: Okay.

77
00:04:27,353 --> 00:04:31,014
Scott: So first of all so Falling for that.

78
00:04:31,094 --> 00:04:34,670
Scott: I don't believe that anyone very many people fell for that.

79
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,114
Rym: Oh, I have some data on that.

80
00:04:36,195 --> 00:04:43,489
Scott: Oh, so all that people doing it were doing it, you know to like say Oh, man, you know high five to whoever pulled this off.

81
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:51,402
Scott: But in the past there have been many scams just like that scam not only in real life But also in.

82
00:04:51,422 --> 00:04:52,569
Scott: you know video games.

83
00:04:53,533 --> 00:04:55,730
Scott: So, you know Ponzi schemes usually work that way.

84
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:59,660
Rym: Ponzi scheme inside of the realm and made a lot right.

85
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,107
Scott: invest and invest a little bit into me.

86
00:05:02,227 --> 00:05:03,270
Scott: I give me $100.

87
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,795
Scott: Oh, look, here's $200.

88
00:05:04,795 --> 00:05:06,380
Scott: Oh, this person is a good investment.

89
00:05:06,581 --> 00:05:06,982
Scott: They give you $500.

90
00:05:06,982 --> 00:05:07,544
Scott: you give them back $1,000.

91
00:05:07,544 --> 00:05:11,484
Scott: Oh, man Here's a million dollars.

92
00:05:11,504 --> 00:05:16,404
Rym: if anyone They're trying to buy enchanted orbs from a cotton account named acute.

93
00:05:16,444 --> 00:05:18,230
Rym: that then disappeared one day with all your money.

94
00:05:18,695 --> 00:05:19,405
Rym: That was me, right?

95
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:23,630
Scott: The scam usually works where you get the person to give you a little bit you double their money.

96
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:24,640
Scott: They give you a little bit more.

97
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,447
Scott: you double their money.

98
00:05:25,468 --> 00:05:26,434
Scott: now They believe you.

99
00:05:26,595 --> 00:05:29,130
Scott: then they give you a whole bunch and you give them back nothing, right?

100
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,294
Scott: In fact, that's getting work.

101
00:05:30,335 --> 00:05:38,535
Rym: that was an evolved form of that was the plot of the square one movie Mm-hmm.

102
00:05:38,555 --> 00:05:44,295
Scott: So the thing is is I don't know how the scam works when it's just a one-shot of Give me money.

103
00:05:44,456 --> 00:05:45,701
Scott: Well, you know you have it.

104
00:05:45,841 --> 00:05:47,970
Scott: You didn't have that opportunity to build up the trust.

105
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,070
Scott: Yeah, it's like an immediate give me money.

106
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:55,589
Rym: Well, what's interesting is coin base said that they actually blocked over a hundred thousand attempts to send money to those addresses.

107
00:05:57,951 --> 00:05:58,956
Rym: I'd I'd believe it.

108
00:05:59,177 --> 00:06:05,425
Rym: the thing that's interesting really before we get into the details of the hack Is that for once it looks like it was actually a hack though.

109
00:06:05,445 --> 00:06:07,031
Scott: There's sort of it was Not?

110
00:06:07,051 --> 00:06:10,623
Rym: yeah, so well, I mean social engineering I would say is hacking.

111
00:06:11,266 --> 00:06:12,550
Scott: sure what I did not.

112
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,197
Scott: I don't care about the semantics right.

113
00:06:14,498 --> 00:06:17,229
Scott: the point is that I keep making that is still true.

114
00:06:17,972 --> 00:06:24,110
Scott: Is that there is no magical purely technological way to log in to a major?

115
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:25,595
Scott: Application?

116
00:06:26,059 --> 00:06:31,890
Scott: as someone you are not Right, you know via it's not like this a magical sequence of keys.

117
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:37,018
Scott: I can press on my keyboard and log into Twitter as The president without knowing the password.

118
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:39,006
Scott: right knowing the password is the only way.

119
00:06:39,126 --> 00:06:40,852
Scott: there's no other way Right.

120
00:06:41,133 --> 00:06:47,269
Scott: It's not like I can download some software and run it and ping some port and do a thing and get login.

121
00:06:47,309 --> 00:06:48,052
Scott: is anyone I want?

122
00:06:48,072 --> 00:06:48,814
Scott: that's not possible.

123
00:06:48,895 --> 00:06:53,050
Rym: I mean occasionally there are zero-day exploits in those spaces, but they're rare.

124
00:06:53,151 --> 00:06:54,477
Rym: They tend to get patched pretty quickly.

125
00:06:54,799 --> 00:07:04,210
Rym: There's also you don't need to know the password You just need to have sufficient information to cause a password reset that you somehow control, right?

126
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:16,287
Scott: so the way that these hack when most of the 90% of the time when someone says they were hacked or you see someone get hacked on a social network like their account was taken Over by someone who is not them it is for one of the following reasons.

127
00:07:16,348 --> 00:07:18,165
Scott: number one Someone has guessed their password.

128
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:18,387
Scott: number.

129
00:07:18,448 --> 00:07:20,364
Scott: two They've told someone their password.

130
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:20,868
Scott: number.

131
00:07:20,888 --> 00:07:25,410
Scott: three Someone took their phone or something and just started using their account or transferred it to themselves.

132
00:07:25,892 --> 00:07:26,574
Scott: Someone hack.

133
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:34,320
Scott: someone got the password to one of their other things like their email and then was able to Switch the emails on the account and get the password reset.

134
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:44,694
Rym: with a lot of somewhere else with a lot of like government sites Especially like ones that don't seem that important There are a lot of direct exploits where people can just do like a really simple cross site nonsense Right.

135
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,690
Rym: some other accounts data, right?

136
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:46,950
Scott: You.

137
00:07:47,031 --> 00:07:55,344
Scott: someone somehow got enough personal information about the person to be able to recover the account to themselves Into the non-correct person.

138
00:07:55,364 --> 00:07:57,431
Scott: right sim Forwarding.

139
00:07:57,451 --> 00:07:59,719
Scott: we see a lot where you see you call the phone company.

140
00:07:59,739 --> 00:08:02,790
Scott: you get them to switch someone's sim card to your sim card.

141
00:08:02,832 --> 00:08:07,994
Scott: Yeah So now that you so all your phone calls and all your texts are now going to the wrong phone Then you do a password reset.

142
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:13,450
Rym: most companies do the password reset like recover your account thing via SMS thus getting you in the door.

143
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,778
Scott: Yep, so that's you.

144
00:08:15,818 --> 00:08:17,930
Scott: that's almost always how it happens.

145
00:08:18,091 --> 00:08:23,790
Scott: There's no magical thing like some evil genius hacker can do with a black screen with green text on it.

146
00:08:24,031 --> 00:08:25,541
Scott: It's like log into my Twitter.

147
00:08:25,561 --> 00:08:26,669
Scott: Yeah, that can't happen.

148
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,033
Rym: No The second way.

149
00:08:28,053 --> 00:08:34,669
Scott: that especially can't happen if you use two-factor authentication because now even if they guess the password they can't do it.

150
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:57,082
Rym: Yeah Now a second way to go after this is sort of a middle ground there where you're not really like hacking like Scott described But what you're doing is spear phishing your target to convince them to do things like Take their one-time password like the the TOTP that they get from the Google Authenticator and Text it to you Because you're tending to be the entity that's checking.

151
00:08:57,342 --> 00:08:59,990
Scott: There's a lot or some store some straight-up phishing, right?

152
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:04,549
Scott: It's like they like that you make a fake Twitter login page and you trick someone into logging into it, right?

153
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:13,430
Rym: Yeah, another thing that happens Specifically is phishing coupled with I targeting a specific individual where you know things about them.

154
00:09:13,852 --> 00:09:14,355
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty.

155
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:15,903
Scott: it's pretty rare for it to be successful.

156
00:09:15,963 --> 00:09:23,930
Rym: but again when this a hack Affected almost entirely high prominence blue checkboxes spear phishing was one of my earliest ideas as to what was happening here.

157
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:24,211
Rym: Yeah,

158
00:09:24,553 --> 00:09:37,836
Scott: the other another thing that happened is an OAuth exploit where you know You ever see those websites where it's like you go there and it's like hey, you know log into our site with Twitter And click OK, and we will show you We'll give you like some feature like.

159
00:09:37,876 --> 00:09:39,921
Scott: we'll show you your Twitter rank or something.

160
00:09:39,941 --> 00:09:41,786
Scott: Yeah, it's like you giving.

161
00:09:41,827 --> 00:09:51,267
Scott: you're giving someone else Permissions on your to on your account right that you know to do to log in as you and do a limited subset of things With the Twitter API.

162
00:09:52,012 --> 00:09:58,515
Scott: So if you trick someone into going to one of those and they don't read the fine print and they're just like log in with Twitter give OAuth permissions.

163
00:09:58,616 --> 00:09:58,896
Scott: Okay.

164
00:09:58,977 --> 00:09:59,217
Scott: Okay.

165
00:09:59,277 --> 00:09:59,619
Scott: Okay.

166
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:03,450
Scott: It's like I gave that website permission to tweet as me, right?

167
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,175
Scott: Yeah, so that's what I thought it could be.

168
00:10:05,215 --> 00:10:21,710
Scott: is like oh a bunch of people, you know gave logged into some app Right and gave the app permission to tweet as them and then either the owners of that app Were acted maliciously or that app was compromised and somebody right was able to use that.

169
00:10:22,071 --> 00:10:26,908
Scott: I guess think about how many things like you've like allowed to tweet on your account that aren't you?

170
00:10:26,928 --> 00:10:33,930
Rym: Yep I uh, I once every couple months actually go and check all the apps authorized and remember do I use this app?

171
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:34,934
Rym: Did I authorize this?

172
00:10:34,974 --> 00:10:35,758
Rym: does this make sense?

173
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:36,823
Rym: and I've kept it down to.

174
00:10:36,904 --> 00:10:38,110
Rym: I have exactly two today.

175
00:10:39,093 --> 00:10:40,123
Scott: Let's see how many I have.

176
00:10:40,184 --> 00:10:46,030
Rym: that aren't Myself because I know what I just removed was the internet creators guild because they seemed they kind of folded.

177
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:47,553
Scott: Let's see.

178
00:10:47,593 --> 00:10:48,859
Scott: We got my Nintendo account.

179
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,965
Scott: Can that tweet as me?

180
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:50,890
Scott: No, it's read-only.

181
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:53,657
Scott: Let's see twitch TV.

182
00:10:53,938 --> 00:10:54,982
Scott: Oh, so twitch could be.

183
00:10:55,082 --> 00:10:57,230
Scott: so if someone compromised twitch they could tweet as me.

184
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:02,046
Scott: Right because I guess I gave twitch permission to tweet when I go live on twitch.

185
00:11:02,126 --> 00:11:07,890
Scott: Yep, right So that means someone who had access to my twitch account could therefore tweet on my Twitter account.

186
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:14,509
Scott: So basically, we don't know the foot wouldn't be able to reset the password on my Twitter account But they could tweet as me and send a tweet asking for a bit cut.

187
00:11:15,011 --> 00:11:18,704
Rym: So what happened here is best we can tell and this is still like an evolving story.

188
00:11:18,724 --> 00:11:20,350
Rym: Like this is pretty new news.

189
00:11:22,011 --> 00:11:27,586
Rym: Most likely this was the social engineering and/or inside job because I think it was.

190
00:11:27,647 --> 00:11:28,870
Scott: and inside job clearly.

191
00:11:29,131 --> 00:11:34,270
Rym: Yeah, well, there are some reports of low paid Twitter employees being straight-up bribed.

192
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:37,103
Scott: I mean that you pay your employees more.

193
00:11:37,123 --> 00:11:41,383
Rym: Yep, like I'm I'm paid enough to where nobody could.

194
00:11:41,484 --> 00:11:42,430
Rym: there's no amount of money.

195
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:45,408
Rym: Someone could would likely be willing to hand me to cop.

196
00:11:47,076 --> 00:11:50,090
Rym: I say likely because for a trillion dollars, I'll do almost anything.

197
00:11:50,331 --> 00:11:53,142
Scott: I mean for a lot less than a trillion I think but no one's.

198
00:11:53,222 --> 00:11:54,828
Scott: likely it's like for a million.

199
00:11:54,868 --> 00:11:57,197
Scott: I do it But it's like no one's gonna pay millions not enough.

200
00:11:57,237 --> 00:12:00,690
Rym: I would I would not compromise my entire life for a million dollars.

201
00:12:01,093 --> 00:12:02,810
Scott: What do you mean you would compromise your life?

202
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,529
Scott: You just get the million dollars and that's it.

203
00:12:05,711 --> 00:12:08,160
Rym: It's really hard to not get caught with that kind of thing.

204
00:12:08,943 --> 00:12:10,368
Scott: Don't don't get caught.

205
00:12:10,549 --> 00:12:10,749
Rym: Yeah

206
00:12:12,871 --> 00:12:13,173
Scott: Anyway,

207
00:12:13,494 --> 00:12:13,775
Rym: but in

208
00:12:13,876 --> 00:12:31,670
Scott: so yeah, yeah, so base turns out that it was a Inside job slash social engineering thing where there are various Twitter employees Presumably people who are low paid moderator types Who still had or customer service people who had the ability to like reset accounts and help customers with their passwords and things of that.

209
00:12:31,991 --> 00:12:33,396
Rym: Someone has to do that job.

210
00:12:33,476 --> 00:12:37,190
Rym: Like what if Bill Gates calls Twitter and says my Twitter stopped fix it, right?

211
00:12:37,412 --> 00:12:38,769
Scott: And it's not a high skill job.

212
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:43,888
Scott: So it's not a high paid job, but it's a job that gives you a lot of access to the systems.

213
00:12:43,949 --> 00:12:51,670
Scott: at Twitter You know the ability to reset people's passwords probably to do things like verify accounts or moderate tweets or all kinds of things.

214
00:12:52,555 --> 00:12:54,163
Rym: The SIM card swapping we just talked about.

215
00:12:54,425 --> 00:13:06,110
Rym: there's a dashboard probably on an internal web app and every cell phone provider where employees can do things like Reassign a SIM assign a new SIM change the email address associated with an account.

216
00:13:06,971 --> 00:13:08,517
Scott: Yeah, that's why it goes to the shell.

217
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:13,689
Scott: You always see them hack into those people and then do bad stuff Right.

218
00:13:15,052 --> 00:13:17,727
Scott: So yeah, and you know, so that's what happened.

219
00:13:18,752 --> 00:13:18,972
Rym: Yep.

220
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:24,085
Rym: Now what's really interesting is this was not a high-tech or even a high-impact hat cuz one.

221
00:13:24,126 --> 00:13:25,569
Rym: it was caught pretty quick to.

222
00:13:26,831 --> 00:13:28,423
Rym: Let's say this game works super well.

223
00:13:28,483 --> 00:13:28,926
Rym: what you made?

224
00:13:28,946 --> 00:13:29,369
Rym: a few mil?

225
00:13:30,492 --> 00:13:33,150
Scott: Okay, I heard they only made tens of thousands of dollars.

226
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,516
Rym: Well, let's say you even made a few mil.

227
00:13:34,858 --> 00:13:49,392
Rym: you blew your load you had you had Access to some of the most read and most important Twitter accounts on earth And you just did a really quick cash grab with a Bitcoin scam and walked away Like.

228
00:13:49,432 --> 00:13:59,710
Rym: that's why I didn't think this was a state-sponsored act because that is a threat vector that I don't tend to like we don't want to talk about because it's not Ninety-nine point nine nine nine percent of the time when something's hacked.

229
00:13:59,992 --> 00:14:08,649
Rym: It is not a state-sponsored actor like for real spies But a for real spy type threat vector could very much do this kind of thing.

230
00:14:09,686 --> 00:14:13,625
Scott: Yeah But I thought a spy would not ask for bitcoins.

231
00:14:14,289 --> 00:14:22,190
Rym: Yes That's not what they're after unless the spy was after something else like discrediting or messing up Twitter in some way like this.

232
00:14:22,992 --> 00:14:34,469
Rym: No, but this just really reeked of some people tried something got got way more access than they Expected used it to pull off the quickest scam they could to then bail.

233
00:14:37,892 --> 00:14:40,280
Rym: There aren't really that many takeaways other than that like.

234
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:49,869
Rym: the real message here is that every service you use No matter how much security you use like you use two-factor you have good passwords You have like everything's good on your side.

235
00:14:50,391 --> 00:14:59,049
Rym: You still have to trust the lowest paid employee with administrative capabilities inside of every company you trust.

236
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,341
Rym: And there's really no way around that.

237
00:15:03,923 --> 00:15:22,070
Rym: and the worst part is I suspect at companies like like social media companies in general I would not be surprised if they do not have the types of controls and audit Capabilities that most other industries have that things like Sarbanes-Oxley regulation require.

238
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:25,579
Rym: Pretty sure it's just a Wild West inside these places.

239
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,247
Rym: compared to say banks like in a bank.

240
00:15:28,789 --> 00:15:39,253
Rym: tellers Yeah, they take key and did all the time a teller could be like yeah I'll just send a billion dollars to this bank that there are so many audits that there is zero way to get away with that Right.

241
00:15:39,293 --> 00:15:40,859
Scott: So the teller is right.

242
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,490
Scott: a teller is an employee with a lot of power, right?

243
00:15:43,932 --> 00:15:48,270
Scott: But and they're not paid that well, they're paid kind of well, but there are controls the worst job.

244
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:50,738
Rym: There are right controls and writes the way.

245
00:15:50,918 --> 00:15:54,590
Scott: so it's like if you know, you could compromise a teller with bribery very easily.

246
00:15:54,991 --> 00:16:03,810
Scott: but they managed to keep them from doing bad things with controls in the system and also People are watching them who are being paid more, right?

247
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:08,730
Scott: So though it's harder you'd have to bribe not only the teller but also the watchers and the watcher watchers, right?

248
00:16:09,152 --> 00:16:13,370
Scott: That's how they avoid paying every bank teller millions of dollars to not be.

249
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:24,470
Rym: That is that only exists in these enterprise spaces where like the company will have a budget for security and auditing That is probably larger than the entire administrative budget of a car.

250
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:25,192
Rym: Well be Twitter.

251
00:16:25,273 --> 00:16:34,286
Scott: that's because that money that they are paying right for that that Protective system right is actually saving the money because they're a bank.

252
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,430
Scott: They would lose a shit ton of money.

253
00:16:35,551 --> 00:16:36,316
Scott: Twitter lose.

254
00:16:36,356 --> 00:16:37,262
Scott: for what did Twitter lose?

255
00:16:37,322 --> 00:16:37,644
Scott: nothing?

256
00:16:38,006 --> 00:16:42,421
Rym: Yeah My Twitter account and discuss right.

257
00:16:42,561 --> 00:16:44,410
Scott: mostly it was undamaged by this.

258
00:16:44,631 --> 00:16:48,890
Scott: So why would they spend a bunch of money to protect from this kind of attack when it doesn't harm them?

259
00:16:49,194 --> 00:17:01,410
Rym: Yep Now here's an interesting point The banks and like the enterprise companies that do this the money they would lose is not so much from the hacks themselves But from the legal consequences of not having the controls in place.

260
00:17:01,631 --> 00:17:10,589
Rym: There's regulations that force them to do a lot of things because by failing to follow those regulations and have controls The government can take huge amounts of money from them.

261
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:15,241
Rym: So maybe we just need more regulation in Silicon Valley?

262
00:17:15,462 --> 00:17:17,630
Scott: maybe well by me you do need regulation.

263
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,696
Scott: But there's also the point of like, okay.

264
00:17:19,757 --> 00:17:21,541
Scott: Why are you regulating this thing?

265
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,047
Scott: That's not damaging.

266
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:27,040
Scott: It's like, okay It's like even someone who is able to compromise this system.

267
00:17:27,102 --> 00:17:27,763
Scott: What can they do?

268
00:17:27,905 --> 00:17:29,370
Scott: It's like nothing of value there.

269
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:30,253
Scott: It's like haha.

270
00:17:30,474 --> 00:17:32,261
Scott: You've broken into the bank of nothing.

271
00:17:32,361 --> 00:17:33,124
Scott: Congratulations.

272
00:17:33,164 --> 00:17:34,550
Scott: Steal all the air in this vault.

273
00:17:35,213 --> 00:17:42,268
Rym: I could foresee things people could do with this kind of attack on Twitter Mostly getting access to sensitive DMS to then blackmail someone

274
00:17:44,516 --> 00:17:44,828
Scott: Sure

275
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:56,989
Rym: Compromise high-profile accounts on say an election day and tweet some crazy nonsense that dominates the news cycle Even for an hour before people figure out what's going on like during it.

276
00:17:57,391 --> 00:17:58,235
Scott: But I mean I could.

277
00:17:58,355 --> 00:18:02,230
Scott: I could just concoct some screenshots to make it look like I've compromised someone's DMS.

278
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:05,348
Scott: And how would you know whether I was legit or not if I had actually done it?

279
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:08,061
Scott: But let's say you actually did it and I faked it.

280
00:18:08,141 --> 00:18:09,890
Scott: How would anyone know who was real and who wasn't?

281
00:18:11,451 --> 00:18:12,996
Scott: Why even bother doing it for real?

282
00:18:13,016 --> 00:18:13,537
Scott: What's the point?

283
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:24,910
Rym: So actually that gets into my news Which is around that Nixon deep fake Which is yeah, the video itself is my thing of the day because it is fucking amazing.

284
00:18:25,432 --> 00:18:33,830
Rym: Like I watched it it looks if you showed that to me without telling me it was a deep fake I would have thought literally wow, they actually recorded that video and never aired.

285
00:18:33,911 --> 00:18:37,347
Scott: It can't tell from the pixels that it's a shot like good lord It is good.

286
00:18:37,671 --> 00:18:51,405
Rym: But the news is this video this long article and a bunch of videos that explain how the deep thing was made like the technology behind it like everything about this space and you really got to pay attention to the space.

287
00:18:51,445 --> 00:18:53,090
Rym: because deep fakes are real.

288
00:18:53,572 --> 00:19:03,309
Rym: Dangerous because as Scott pointed out once you can fake things with fidelity enough to fool Most people then we enter a post-evident society pretty quick.

289
00:19:04,612 --> 00:19:16,090
Rym: That's where auditing and metadata and things like multiple camera angles are Almost the only way to detect reality from lies like to prove a DM that Scott concocted was fake.

290
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:27,674
Rym: We would need to look like get Twitter subpoena the actual raw metadata like logs from physical Servers that handle that information and concoct a context not concoct But construct.

291
00:19:27,915 --> 00:19:38,450
Rym: concocting is what Scott's gonna try to do if Scott ahead to construct or concoct in his case The like all the metadata that would be left behind in log files throughout Twitter's infrastructure.

292
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:43,130
Rym: That is way harder to do if not impossible than just faking the screenshot.

293
00:19:43,591 --> 00:19:52,490
Rym: the deep fake video by itself is perfect as far as most people are concerned but the way to have Deepfake proof proof in the future is to have metadata.

294
00:19:53,053 --> 00:19:56,029
Rym: Evidence like here is a physical tape that they used to record it.

295
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:59,767
Rym: Here is a photo someone took while they were recording it all this other data.

296
00:19:59,787 --> 00:20:00,410
Rym: That's harder to fake.

297
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:09,129
Scott: But the point of this news is just that even if even if someone could prove that the stuff was fake Right that takes time and effort right?

298
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:16,170
Rym: Coming through the day after the election not the day of the election Right journalists comb through all your fake Twitter logs.

299
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:17,976
Scott: Okay, these have we found out?

300
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:19,942
Scott: these have been faked and it's like well, yeah.

301
00:20:20,003 --> 00:20:22,090
Rym: Well, if you already lost the election there aren't do-overs.

302
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:27,590
Rym: So, uh, I don't want to dominate the whole show with this.

303
00:20:27,671 --> 00:20:31,285
Rym: I'm not gonna get more into it But I urge you to read this article even if you need.

304
00:20:31,305 --> 00:20:32,745
Rym: the Nixon video is cool Like watch it.

305
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:39,730
Rym: But honestly read this article and watch the video in this article that actually explains how this stuff works.

306
00:20:40,233 --> 00:20:46,522
Scott: It is way more accessible than you might think Yeah, people make their own all the time at home like.

307
00:20:46,542 --> 00:20:51,430
Scott: you can just make them as easily as you can make Photoshop Yes, need some CPU time and yeah software.

308
00:20:51,571 --> 00:20:53,980
Rym: I've seen awesome people in my own Twitter feed who made some.

309
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,404
Rym: they weren't great, but they were like, yeah to make it great I would have to spend like another few months training it.

310
00:20:59,786 --> 00:21:00,690
Rym: like there's a lot of things.

311
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:01,675
Scott: Yeah, well you can make.

312
00:21:01,816 --> 00:21:06,177
Scott: you can't make great ones like the Nixon one at home easily But you can make really damn good ones.

313
00:21:06,318 --> 00:21:08,367
Scott: That would probably still fool a bunch of stupid people.

314
00:21:08,588 --> 00:21:12,979
Scott: Yep So, I guess not soup not stupid people but gullible people.

315
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:17,070
Rym: yeah gullible people naive people unaware people noobs.

316
00:21:18,691 --> 00:21:28,792
Rym: So someone who is not aware of the existence of deep fake technology Yep, or someone who is primed to believe the thing you've deep fake and thus we'll just ignore all the bad pixels Mmm.

317
00:21:29,113 --> 00:21:32,450
Rym: in a final news this happened a while ago, but we didn't really get a chance to talk about it.

318
00:21:33,193 --> 00:21:44,694
Scott: I think we mentioned a few times that you probably should not run tick-tock Like on any device you own if you want to watch some good tick-tocks cuz there are some good ones you to watch them on To watch them on Twitter and YouTube.

319
00:21:44,955 --> 00:21:50,385
Scott: Yep, when they get real uploaded do not install the actual tick-tock app on anything you own Yep.

320
00:21:50,631 --> 00:21:52,480
Rym: So I got a three articles to link to.

321
00:21:52,661 --> 00:21:58,570
Rym: one is there was a guy Not that long ago who basically posted a thing where he was like.

322
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:04,849
Rym: so I fucked around with the tick-tock app and like sniffed its packets and reverse engineered as much as I could.

323
00:22:04,869 --> 00:22:09,103
Rym: and Yes, it steals your data, but you do that like everything steals your data.

324
00:22:09,163 --> 00:22:12,028
Rym: every app you install steals your data for something Especially if it's free.

325
00:22:12,571 --> 00:22:24,630
Rym: But he compared what tick-tock looked like it was doing to all those other similarly shady apps and tick-tock seems to go Way beyond what any other app is doing.

326
00:22:25,591 --> 00:22:29,449
Rym: Like the proof of the threat profile of tick-tock appeared to be really bad.

327
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:39,190
Rym: independent of that There is a lot of evidence that tick-tock is probably tied to the Chinese government in ways that are concerning.

328
00:22:40,091 --> 00:22:51,670
Rym: these articles go into a lot of detail about all the different angles from which tick-tock is basically a Terrible idea that you should never trust on any device you own under any circumstances.

329
00:22:52,192 --> 00:22:53,257
Scott: So I find it strange.

330
00:22:53,457 --> 00:22:56,450
Scott: I find it strange that vine died and vine was perfectly fine.

331
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:59,638
Scott: All right Twitter bought it then it died right?

332
00:22:59,658 --> 00:23:03,307
Rym: well Twitter and then because it wasn't the right demographic whatever.

333
00:23:03,688 --> 00:23:09,667
Scott: and then Several people attempted to remake vine including the people who originally made vine.

334
00:23:10,189 --> 00:23:14,610
Scott: and yet Why was tick-tock the one that ended up being successful?

335
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:19,523
Scott: Whereas the the actual remake of vine by the vine people was not successful.

336
00:23:19,603 --> 00:23:20,085
Scott: It's like what.

337
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:22,735
Scott: I don't understand how that happened I suspect.

338
00:23:22,835 --> 00:23:24,482
Scott: why would you if you're sitting there?

339
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:26,070
Scott: It's like why would you choose that one?

340
00:23:26,611 --> 00:23:28,283
Rym: I suspect but I'm die.

341
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:45,649
Rym: This is pure opinion but these articles actually talk about this a little bit that it's partly because tick-tock had massive amounts of marketing money behind itself to drive Its interaction in the early days to drive early adopters and to make tick-tock float to the top everywhere.

342
00:23:46,532 --> 00:23:48,881
Rym: Mm-hmm pretty sure that's what happens.

343
00:23:49,483 --> 00:23:51,490
Rym: But again, you can read these articles.

344
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:55,328
Rym: I'll link to a CNN one and a Bloomberg one because they get into a lot of the details.

345
00:23:55,408 --> 00:23:58,890
Rym: like Multiple governments around the world have banned tick-tock.

346
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:04,110
Rym: Recently multiple companies have banned tick-tock being installed on any company owned devices.

347
00:24:05,352 --> 00:24:08,510
Rym: The tick-tock is not cool and you should not be running right, right?

348
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:16,317
Scott: Tick-tock is not a situation like with zoom where zoom is just made by people who's not trying to fuck up Zoom's actually trying really hard zoom.

349
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:18,847
Scott: Yeah, zoom is just low quality software.

350
00:24:18,947 --> 00:24:19,670
Rym: I don't trust zoom.

351
00:24:19,851 --> 00:24:23,852
Rym: I refuse to ensure all it but I don't think they're trying to get it's trying to get better Right.

352
00:24:24,173 --> 00:24:25,942
Scott: Tick-tock is not low quality software.

353
00:24:25,982 --> 00:24:27,509
Scott: It's actively malicious software.

354
00:24:27,529 --> 00:24:32,207
Rym: Yep Now I know I'm the kind of person who treats both equally like work.

355
00:24:32,428 --> 00:24:36,575
Scott: Well, of course It's just I'm getting some Difference.

356
00:24:36,916 --> 00:24:39,104
Rym: and they the only conferencing they support a zoom.

357
00:24:39,486 --> 00:24:40,610
Rym: So I even raised an issue.

358
00:24:40,691 --> 00:24:42,470
Rym: I was like I refused to install this client.

359
00:24:42,791 --> 00:24:48,410
Rym: They let me use the web client instead like I was unwilling to install this client on any device I owned.

360
00:24:48,711 --> 00:24:50,460
Rym: But again zoom is not malicious.

361
00:24:50,842 --> 00:24:52,370
Rym: They just have fucked up several times.

362
00:24:59,047 --> 00:25:01,869
Rym: but anyway things Of the day.

363
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,380
Rym: so I kind of preempted myself.

364
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,651
Rym: My thing of the day is that Nixon video.

365
00:25:05,692 --> 00:25:07,199
Rym: but the context of this video.

366
00:25:08,022 --> 00:25:14,440
Rym: When Apollo 11 happened like we sent human beings to the goddamn moon for the first time ever.

367
00:25:15,204 --> 00:25:23,380
Rym: That was so long ago that it's terrifying But it happened long before any of us most people listening to the show were born.

368
00:25:23,843 --> 00:25:26,060
Rym: People went up on the moon and walked around and that was crazy.

369
00:25:26,665 --> 00:25:28,240
Scott: And not only that we did it a bunch of times.

370
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:35,660
Scott: If you forget all that They only forget the first time where we like poked our head out and went back in and we don't people forget the time We're like we went out and drove around and shit.

371
00:25:35,741 --> 00:25:37,866
Rym: Yeah, of course There wasn't what people also remember.

372
00:25:37,906 --> 00:25:41,541
Rym: the time we what we tried to go out and blew up and barely made it back Right.

373
00:25:41,742 --> 00:25:46,440
Scott: the two most famous times not the awesomest time where we went around and did a whole bunch of stuff.

374
00:25:46,561 --> 00:25:50,888
Rym: Yeah, who remembers what happened in Apollo 17?

375
00:25:50,888 --> 00:26:02,640
Rym: I But this like people really today do not fully appreciate how I'm quoting someone who wrote an article about this a while ago fucking insane.

376
00:26:02,881 --> 00:26:18,440
Rym: It was to send humans to the moon with the technology we had in 1969. like the odds of success were as high as they could be and they were not as high as I think any of you would have been comfortable with if you were fully like involved in this situation.

377
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:32,620
Rym: So the president of the United States Richard Richard Nixon into the time who is no longer the most corrupt president in American history somehow Had to write about like head of speech for the success.

378
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:36,537
Rym: Like he gave this big speech like we fucking send people to the moon and now they're home.

379
00:26:36,657 --> 00:26:41,140
Rym: Oh my god They also wrote a speech for all the different ways.

380
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:52,313
Rym: The astronauts might not come back like every possible Terrifying news that the president would have to give to the American people Quickly if something went very wrong and right.

381
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:54,000
Scott: because I mean, you know rocket exploded.

382
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:56,679
Scott: They made it there and they're gonna be stuck on the moon.

383
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,974
Rym: I'm like, they're gonna die there and I can't get stuck in space.

384
00:26:59,994 --> 00:27:01,180
Scott: that even make it to the moon.

385
00:27:01,902 --> 00:27:02,564
Scott: They they're gonna.

386
00:27:02,624 --> 00:27:05,012
Scott: they died on their way back to earth in the atmosphere.

387
00:27:05,032 --> 00:27:11,300
Scott: You know, it's this is why the odds are low Many many ways to die and very few ways to succeed.

388
00:27:11,742 --> 00:27:16,120
Rym: So the text of one of those speeches like those speeches that's all public information.

389
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:22,400
Rym: Now like you can go read the text of every version of a speech Nixon Who was gonna give depending on how things went with all these launches?

390
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:35,607
Rym: But the deep fake video is someone took one of those speeches He never made and the deep fake is Nixon very convincingly giving that speech Mmm and it fooled me.

391
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:38,560
Rym: at least it would have fooled me if I didn't already know it was a fake.

392
00:27:39,042 --> 00:27:40,226
Scott: Well, I mean you could have been fooled.

393
00:27:40,286 --> 00:27:42,615
Scott: all I think it's the as the additional effect of like.

394
00:27:42,636 --> 00:27:43,780
Scott: you could tell someone right?

395
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:48,998
Scott: Like hey, they actually recorded Nixon making all the speeches and that way they could just play the one that was the real one.

396
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:51,698
Rym: Yep And that's plausible right?

397
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,724
Rym: Plausibility plus deep fake.

398
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:54,807
Rym: you're good to go.

399
00:27:54,907 --> 00:27:56,932
Rym: You can fuck things up with that technology.

400
00:27:57,354 --> 00:27:59,419
Rym: So be if your pet be prepared.

401
00:28:00,224 --> 00:28:02,380
Scott: So he only gave the one that actually happened.

402
00:28:03,344 --> 00:28:04,055
Scott: What do I have?

403
00:28:04,096 --> 00:28:04,218
Scott: so?

404
00:28:05,501 --> 00:28:16,891
Scott: You know last I think on a recent thing of the day maybe even the most recent one I was I talked about how I was watching a bunch of DJ's on Twitch because you know That's what you do when you're stuck inside all the time, right?

405
00:28:16,951 --> 00:28:18,015
Scott: You're looking for new music.

406
00:28:18,056 --> 00:28:18,638
Scott: No concerts.

407
00:28:18,678 --> 00:28:19,040
Scott: No nothing.

408
00:28:19,788 --> 00:28:20,839
Scott: The club is closed, right?

409
00:28:21,981 --> 00:28:25,720
Scott: Or the club is trying to open and getting shut down because they were stupid and tried to open.

410
00:28:27,702 --> 00:28:29,948
Scott: And You know just I looked at.

411
00:28:29,968 --> 00:28:39,360
Scott: my last thing of the day was a video showing how to DJ But I wanted to highlight one of maybe my favorite DJ that I found on Twitch and also other services.

412
00:28:39,922 --> 00:28:42,630
Scott: Right is the lovely Natasha dig.

413
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:45,740
Scott: so there was this show that I didn't know existed until now.

414
00:28:46,121 --> 00:28:53,039
Scott: So I guess we have to thank being trapped inside and people DJing online for my discovery of it But apparently it's been going on for many years.

415
00:28:53,825 --> 00:28:57,743
Scott: They got this show called soul and the horn and The.

416
00:28:57,884 --> 00:29:07,379
Scott: it's basically two people, you know the DJ Natasha and this music curator producer type person named D prosper who I don't know anything about because I don't see them on the screen.

417
00:29:07,742 --> 00:29:08,497
Scott: I only see the DJ.

418
00:29:10,342 --> 00:29:13,515
Scott: And apparently they were doing shows like all over the city, and you could see like.

419
00:29:13,535 --> 00:29:20,673
Scott: if you look on their Twitter account It'll be like yeah, Chelsea music call 12 bucks You know be like yeah, even even saw like Lincoln Center like you know like.

420
00:29:20,693 --> 00:29:22,600
Scott: they're playing all around the city all this time.

421
00:29:23,246 --> 00:29:27,988
Scott: Right you know doing shows But of course they were forced to stop doing shows.

422
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:45,943
Scott: so now they have an excellent streaming setup From their little record vault in Brooklyn and also other locations as you know the case may be And basically it is absolutely far and away the best DJing I've seen or heard On.

423
00:29:46,003 --> 00:29:50,656
Scott: Twitch is totally free, and they're doing all sorts of cool stuff over there right.

424
00:29:50,676 --> 00:29:51,459
Scott: so the first cool thing.

425
00:29:51,479 --> 00:30:04,094
Scott: They're doing They are not Filtering their money through twitch right they're basically I guess Elicitly going around and they're like yeah, send us money with cash app or whatever directly.

426
00:30:04,175 --> 00:30:05,740
Scott: There's no there's no twitch subs.

427
00:30:05,901 --> 00:30:06,606
Scott: There's no nothing.

428
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:16,951
Rym: that's honestly Probably the right way to go with anything like if we tried to make money from our streaming We would not rely on YouTube and twitch monetization.

429
00:30:17,533 --> 00:30:19,300
Scott: right it's only it's only Friday nights.

430
00:30:19,781 --> 00:30:27,020
Scott: So you have to you want to check with their website or their social media Instagram whatever to figure out exactly when it's gonna be On Friday, but it's like it's only Fridays.

431
00:30:27,161 --> 00:30:30,200
Scott: It's not like a constant thing right like some of these other people are doing.

432
00:30:31,063 --> 00:30:37,909
Scott: and the other cool thing they do which really I think helps build the community around it is They have a zoom.

433
00:30:38,171 --> 00:30:39,519
Scott: It's a zoom whatever right.

434
00:30:40,443 --> 00:30:48,459
Scott: But what they do is the idea is that you would since there's no club It's just this person in in Brooklyn DJing by themselves with a bunch of cameras, right?

435
00:30:49,463 --> 00:30:55,100
Scott: That you would go on zoom and dance and then they show people dancing at home.

436
00:30:55,902 --> 00:31:09,480
Scott: Right it's like you're watching and like someone's controlling the camera and switching between like you know the DJ someone dancing at home Some old-school video footage right some models dancing at home Right and it's like actually pretty fun.

437
00:31:10,582 --> 00:31:11,545
Scott: It gives you like this.

438
00:31:11,585 --> 00:31:15,940
Scott: You know sort of community feeling and plus the music is like unbelievable.

439
00:31:17,622 --> 00:31:24,434
Scott: So yeah, if you are looking for something to do on Friday night, and you don't want to go outside This is as close as you're gonna get to go into the club.

440
00:31:24,655 --> 00:31:27,471
Scott: Yeah, so on the horn There's no relation this Friday.

441
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:32,659
Scott: No relation to The album soul in the horn by what's-his-name nah?

442
00:31:33,462 --> 00:31:34,068
Scott: What's-his-name?

443
00:31:34,088 --> 00:31:34,734
Scott: well done?

444
00:31:36,522 --> 00:31:36,905
Scott: I'll hurt.

445
00:31:37,147 --> 00:31:40,375
Scott: no relation to the owl hurt album That I'm aware of.

446
00:31:41,541 --> 00:31:42,666
Rym: All right in the meta moment.

447
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:43,631
Rym: We're stuck.

448
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:45,740
Rym: Oh, we can't do stuff.

449
00:31:46,201 --> 00:31:53,140
Rym: It's actually really hard to record panels because we're not in the same physical place and this is barely works.

450
00:31:53,301 --> 00:31:54,153
Rym: What we're doing right here?

451
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:58,294
Scott: It is not easy Working on plans.

452
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:58,740
Rym: We're good.

453
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:06,883
Rym: We're gonna have live or at least live to tape panels at the crunchyroll Expo at PAX online and at more Conventions.

454
00:32:07,004 --> 00:32:11,160
Rym: TBD magfest looks like they're doing something cool, so stay tuned on all that.

455
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:15,980
Rym: We are working hard to bring a bunch of content online in all these places.

456
00:32:17,621 --> 00:32:19,807
Rym: The fun part is for various reasons.

457
00:32:19,927 --> 00:32:21,411
Rym: you might end up the video you watch.

458
00:32:22,154 --> 00:32:29,017
Rym: we might be doing the show live like Outside in a New York City park somewhere who knows we'll see.

459
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:29,620
Rym: stay tuned.

460
00:32:30,521 --> 00:32:35,078
Scott: Yeah, so also I've been playing pay for Mario or a gummy king that just came out.

461
00:32:35,218 --> 00:32:35,600
Rym: I got it.

462
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,890
Rym: I'm gonna start it tonight.

463
00:32:36,911 --> 00:32:37,274
Rym: I think no.

464
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:52,384
Scott: I don't know if it's your jam or not, but I finally went through the effort, and I set up a good twitch streaming setup here, so Because it's now so easy to just turn it on and play That's what I've been doing.

465
00:32:52,605 --> 00:32:55,414
Scott: so if you want to watch me play pay for Mario.

466
00:32:55,856 --> 00:32:57,000
Scott: It's a my twitch channel.

467
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:02,036
Scott: I didn't go to YouTube because YouTube still has some in Nintendo stuff going on.

468
00:33:02,437 --> 00:33:02,698
Scott: right.

469
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:05,379
Rym: yeah You can't really stream Nintendo games.

470
00:33:07,237 --> 00:33:14,420
Scott: And Also, I could do some discord, but it's a little hard to do discord and something else at the same time.

471
00:33:14,983 --> 00:33:18,020
Scott: So you know maybe what I see if I stream some non Nintendo.

472
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:22,653
Scott: Maybe I'll do the twitch plus YouTube or discord only or you know who knows.

473
00:33:22,753 --> 00:33:29,740
Scott: maybe you'll just have to go and subscribe to all Three of those places if you want to figure out when or what I'm just dreaming.

474
00:33:30,603 --> 00:33:31,485
Scott: My setup is good.

475
00:33:31,806 --> 00:33:43,535
Rym: basically follow Scott on Twitch and YouTube scallops follow me on YouTube and join the front row crew Forum discord where occasionally like I'll just stream quest for glory in there.

476
00:33:43,575 --> 00:33:44,780
Rym: I'm playing quest for glory one again.

477
00:33:46,805 --> 00:33:48,500
Rym: That game is actually.

478
00:33:49,504 --> 00:33:59,260
Rym: It holds up way better than I expected though There are a few soft locks that I remembered from being a kid and those were never fixed.

479
00:33:59,502 --> 00:34:01,316
Rym: So I tested and I found them all again.

480
00:34:01,336 --> 00:34:01,880
Rym: They're still there.

481
00:34:01,941 --> 00:34:03,822
Rym: So if you play that game Don't are they?

482
00:34:03,883 --> 00:34:05,168
Scott: are they at least the ones we like?

483
00:34:05,188 --> 00:34:06,353
Scott: you know you soft locked?

484
00:34:06,454 --> 00:34:07,860
Scott: or are they the ones where you're gonna be?

485
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,659
Scott: If you've never played the game before you're just gonna be sitting there for hours wanting to hurt yourself.

486
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,051
Rym: They're obvious because you can't click on anything anymore and the game just kind of.

487
00:34:15,071 --> 00:34:16,275
Rym: for oh is that?

488
00:34:16,335 --> 00:34:17,179
Scott: so that's a hard lock?

489
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:22,940
Rym: Well, no no cuz the game still progresses But you can't interact with anything anymore.

490
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:26,835
Rym: But the like the animations on screen are still going the NPCs are still walking around.

491
00:34:26,857 --> 00:34:27,620
Scott: still a hard lock.

492
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,021
Scott: Is that?

493
00:34:28,041 --> 00:34:28,844
Scott: the game is broken?

494
00:34:28,864 --> 00:34:29,628
Scott: you can't do anything.

495
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:31,735
Scott: a soft lock is like you're playing Mario, right?

496
00:34:32,418 --> 00:34:34,625
Scott: And You you know, you're.

497
00:34:34,665 --> 00:34:41,165
Scott: you're in a room and you're surrounded by bricks and the p-switches on the outside of the bricks And you can't get out there.

498
00:34:41,407 --> 00:34:41,708
Scott: Yeah.

499
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:42,574
Scott: Well a soft lock.

500
00:34:42,634 --> 00:34:43,540
Scott: It's like you can still play.

501
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:43,904
Scott: There's nothing.

502
00:34:43,944 --> 00:34:44,895
Scott: the game's not broken, right?

503
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:49,000
Scott: You're just can't progress because the state of the game is such that you're stuck.

504
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:49,341
Scott: There

505
00:34:49,601 --> 00:35:03,944
Rym: are some ways to kill yourself where you don't realize you've done it until later But that you're actually warned about that and they're all obvious and the game tells you save a lot for that reason because a lot Of times those deaths are really funny But they never.

506
00:35:04,325 --> 00:35:09,520
Rym: it's like there's this one blue monster and if you keep fucking with it, it eventually jumps up into the sky.

507
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,447
Rym: It's like this bouncing thing.

508
00:35:10,487 --> 00:35:12,119
Rym: it disappears and you're like, huh?

509
00:35:13,142 --> 00:35:18,411
Rym: Okay Five minutes later whatever you're doing in the game.

510
00:35:18,451 --> 00:35:24,423
Rym: If you didn't like deal with that situation it you just hear Exactly Five minutes later.

511
00:35:24,524 --> 00:35:24,885
Rym: I think it's.

512
00:35:24,945 --> 00:35:30,968
Rym: I forget exactly how long it is, but some short span of time later That's just long enough for you have forgotten.

513
00:35:31,269 --> 00:35:33,320
Rym: You'll hear that noise and it'll fall on you and kill you.

514
00:35:34,142 --> 00:35:34,927
Scott: Okay, pretty cool.

515
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:37,866
Rym: But yeah, but the game's playable Okay.

516
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:38,980
Rym: All right.

517
00:35:39,341 --> 00:35:42,168
Rym: So we talked about the book.

518
00:35:42,188 --> 00:35:43,751
Scott: club book is still the tale of Genji.

519
00:35:43,812 --> 00:35:44,754
Scott: when we'll reread it?

520
00:35:44,974 --> 00:35:45,937
Scott: some nobody knows.

521
00:35:46,358 --> 00:35:50,991
Scott: Yeah Biking a lot summer eating some reading is canceled 2020.

522
00:35:50,991 --> 00:35:53,667
Rym: Yeah I'm reading a lot of nonfiction lately.

523
00:35:53,968 --> 00:35:54,830
Rym: for a lot of reasons.

524
00:35:54,931 --> 00:35:58,200
Scott: we're going for the record of longest book club book without being read.

525
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,790
Rym: The worst part is if COVID hadn't happened.

526
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:00,937
Rym: I feel like we would have read it by now.

527
00:36:01,681 --> 00:36:02,284
Scott: Yes, I do.

528
00:36:02,304 --> 00:36:04,635
Scott: I believe that because I was reading on the subway.

529
00:36:04,655 --> 00:36:07,890
Rym: Yeah, I was reading on the subway Also, I had a lot of travel or I would have powered through it.

530
00:36:08,473 --> 00:36:13,189
Rym: So oh, yeah, we each Talked about this topic at least out.

531
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:17,080
Rym: similar related topic a long time ago on GeekNights back in like 2009.

532
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,671
Scott: that's been 11 years.

533
00:36:19,691 --> 00:36:21,478
Scott: Okay, we can do a half redo

534
00:36:22,089 --> 00:36:39,320
Rym: Yep but the topic was basically full disclosure the idea being if you find a bug or an exploit that could be like that you Could exploit in some way in commercial software in an online system Do you tell the world about it and tell the full details about how it works?

535
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:45,560
Rym: Do you just tell the company that's affected and tell them the full detail of how it works but hide it from everyone else?

536
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:53,300
Rym: Do you tell the whole world that it exists but only tell the company that has the problem the full details like that whole conversation?

537
00:36:53,960 --> 00:37:07,739
Rym: But we want to expand this and talk about it more generically in the terms of disclosure at all like the idea of responsible disclosure especially because Bug bounties have become a much bigger thing in the decades since we did that last show.

538
00:37:08,462 --> 00:37:19,021
Scott: Well, I mean bug bounties are nothing new always been around right but I think what's happened is that they had like a big spike and now they've sort of like settled into the status quo for quite a few years of Like.

539
00:37:19,041 --> 00:37:22,680
Scott: these expectations like of what bug bounties are all about.

540
00:37:22,805 --> 00:37:32,399
Scott: Yeah And there's a lot of problems with these bug bounty systems that exist and they're basically aren't being addressed because the status quo Which is not good is being maintained.

541
00:37:33,682 --> 00:37:42,777
Scott: So the first major problem with the bug bounty systems is that a lot of companies employ them when it is not really appropriate for their situation, right.

542
00:37:43,139 --> 00:37:48,280
Scott: so Usually when when would a company have value in a bug bounty program, right?

543
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:54,500
Scott: So the idea is hey, we have software that's important security wise that we make right?

544
00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:04,720
Scott: We want to know about all the vulnerabilities in that software so we can solve them quickly And we're willing to pay people to solve those problems because it's our product is worth money, right?

545
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:09,920
Scott: The thing is you could just hire security experts to do that, right?

546
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:15,415
Scott: Why would you know that the bounty program is like, you know in case someone else out there?

547
00:38:15,435 --> 00:38:24,659
Scott: Yeah, right has Right accidentally found something That you would hope that your bounty program would convince them.

548
00:38:25,122 --> 00:38:39,090
Scott: Okay person out there you found a bug in our software, right We're encouraging you with this with this bounty money to tell us responsibly, yeah and Get paid by us as opposed to doing crime with it.

549
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:44,215
Rym: to get money or you could a low dollar programs Where the goal is even simpler?

550
00:38:45,400 --> 00:39:00,320
Rym: If I get people out there to find low Importance like minor bugs that you don't care that much about but you're not gonna invest enough in QA to find and test and fix but it'll say it's almost like an On-demand secondary QA of your thing.

551
00:39:00,741 --> 00:39:02,426
Rym: I've seen that you or you could.

552
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:06,840
Scott: you could use that as a hiring pool like you're finding people to hire to become your security.

553
00:39:07,141 --> 00:39:09,312
Rym: I didn't even think of that because that is someone.

554
00:39:09,352 --> 00:39:13,380
Rym: how I got my last job Not someone cares is but a similar situation.

555
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:19,360
Scott: Right, someone cares enough about your software to in their spare time find some bugs in it and they're successful at it.

556
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:26,489
Scott: It's like yeah, you'll give them money and hire them right and have the joy the team like I'll tell you all this is like This is useful anecdotal information for you in the future.

557
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:27,793
Rym: My previous job.

558
00:39:27,853 --> 00:39:29,860
Rym: The way I got it was I was at a company.

559
00:39:30,425 --> 00:39:32,179
Rym: I bought software from another company.

560
00:39:33,182 --> 00:39:48,216
Rym: that software had a lot of problems and I sent them a huge number of extremely detailed bug reports and feature requests to the point that they literally Approached me and said you want to just come and manage this product for us.

561
00:39:48,256 --> 00:39:50,579
Rym: We'll pay you plenty Sure.

562
00:39:51,481 --> 00:39:59,282
Scott: So anyway, so the problem is a lot of companies set up these bug bounty programs when a they don't have the resources to fix All the bugs.

563
00:39:59,644 --> 00:40:09,020
Scott: Yeah, so people start submitting all kinds of bugs and security vulnerabilities And they don't have the capacity to fix all the bugs in their bug log, right?

564
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:12,812
Scott: Yeah, it's getting filled up like crazy and it's like oh shit.

565
00:40:12,933 --> 00:40:14,980
Rym: And now what do you pay the bounties now?

566
00:40:15,101 --> 00:40:17,960
Rym: You're just spending cash and not fixing the problem.

567
00:40:18,321 --> 00:40:26,065
Scott: You're spending cash to fill up your bug log or you and now people know about bugs in your software that you can't fix You're actually in a worse position.

568
00:40:26,185 --> 00:40:27,891
Scott: Yep, or encouraging people.

569
00:40:28,232 --> 00:40:30,780
Rym: Do you not pay the bounties now?

570
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:38,859
Rym: You've got a bunch of angry hackers who have found bugs And have documented those bugs and are ready and willing to exploit them.

571
00:40:40,901 --> 00:40:41,940
Rym: Mm-hmm.

572
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,560
Scott: So yeah, that's a big problem.

573
00:40:45,081 --> 00:40:52,060
Scott: Another problem and I see this is like the real crime here right is when it sort of gets turned on its head, right?

574
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:52,763
Scott: It's like okay.

575
00:40:53,024 --> 00:40:58,858
Scott: We don't want people who find security vulnerabilities to do crimes So we'll give a monetary incentive to do the good thing.

576
00:40:59,622 --> 00:41:01,871
Scott: People then turn around and say oh, well, you know what?

577
00:41:02,795 --> 00:41:04,100
Scott: I'm not gonna get hired by anyone.

578
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:10,195
Scott: I'm just gonna sit at home and try to complete as many bug bounties as I can and that'll be my you know Not real job.

579
00:41:10,235 --> 00:41:13,207
Rym: Yeah That's part of the gig gig economy.

580
00:41:13,568 --> 00:41:23,711
Scott: granted the gig economy is a scam but that's a separate right and this is an exploitative Practice because basically the bug bounties don't pay enough right.

581
00:41:23,791 --> 00:41:38,840
Scott: the effort required to find bugs that pay a lot of that are worth a lot and the time it takes to find them is like full-time job plus like it's not easy to find a Vulnerability that is worthy of a huge payout, right?

582
00:41:39,241 --> 00:41:45,480
Scott: So if you spend all your time doing that the even if the companies pay you you won't be making what you're worth, right?

583
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:56,900
Scott: so people end up doing this because the system is created and it entices people to do it and encourages people to do it when That's not something anyone should be doing.

584
00:41:57,161 --> 00:41:57,883
Rym: Well think it's very.

585
00:41:57,943 --> 00:42:10,820
Rym: it's very similar to a lot of other exploitative practices in the gig economy like specifically You're basically outsourcing this work to people who are kind of desperate who will do it because that's the only work they can find.

586
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:15,980
Rym: Like they have these skills, but they can't make money doing anything because the economy is fucked and capitalism is a scam.

587
00:42:16,481 --> 00:42:17,464
Rym: So they end up doing this.

588
00:42:17,865 --> 00:42:23,460
Rym: but think about even if you're a cold heartless killer and you don't care about that person's plight at All.

589
00:42:24,062 --> 00:42:35,460
Rym: think of it from a purely exploitative as an evil person standpoint if you're not Extremely skilled motivated and desperate to find those bugs.

590
00:42:36,182 --> 00:42:42,218
Rym: But the black market is willing to pay those people to find bugs for them and they're paying more than you're paying.

591
00:42:42,539 --> 00:42:46,704
Rym: you've actually weaponized this person against herself Exactly this person.

592
00:42:46,784 --> 00:42:51,800
Scott: if you hadn't had this bounty program, maybe they wouldn't have learned your software so well, right?

593
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:56,940
Scott: You just created someone who knows your software really well and knows how to find vulnerabilities in it.

594
00:42:57,243 --> 00:42:58,560
Scott: That person would not have existed.

595
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,789
Scott: No one would have cared enough about your software without you.

596
00:43:00,809 --> 00:43:01,954
Scott: it had the opposite.

597
00:43:01,974 --> 00:43:03,420
Scott: you were trying to make your software more secure.

598
00:43:03,824 --> 00:43:08,572
Scott: You in fact just created People who are very good at hurting your software and now you have to.

599
00:43:08,612 --> 00:43:10,460
Scott: basically they have the they're no longer.

600
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,986
Scott: Are you paying a bounty right?

601
00:43:12,267 --> 00:43:14,636
Scott: They're now blackmailing you into paying.

602
00:43:14,817 --> 00:43:17,640
Scott: Yep, right You should have paid them in the first place.

603
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:24,920
Rym: But you know I don't even blame the person who sells themselves out to the dark side of the web because that's their hustle.

604
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:30,191
Scott: They're they're fucked anyway Mm-hmm, it also creates a lot of situations.

605
00:43:30,653 --> 00:43:42,880
Scott: even if you pay people or have a Consistent policy of when and what you'll pay for it creates a lot of bad press amongst the tech people Which I guess is not good because those are people you would want to hire.

606
00:43:43,381 --> 00:43:44,505
Scott: Right possibly right.

607
00:43:44,586 --> 00:43:53,538
Scott: and those people if you get bad press because you know, they see something like hey, you know I found these bugs in the software and they won't pay me and you have some legit reason like it's like.

608
00:43:53,678 --> 00:44:03,002
Scott: actually We only pay for this and that and you know It has to be a vulnerability that does this and we don't consider that to be you know a Super.

609
00:44:03,383 --> 00:44:13,379
Scott: we don't consider that to be as severe a security threat as that person who found it says it is because it would require You to have like pre-existing access to the machine or something like that.

610
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:27,453
Scott: So we consider that to only be worth this much money And you end up having to have all these PR fights and that ends up being the job of someone at your company to do all that Communications work right with the bug bounty finding community.

611
00:44:27,473 --> 00:44:28,235
Rym: Oh, wow.

612
00:44:28,276 --> 00:44:29,540
Scott: There's a really it's never.

613
00:44:30,642 --> 00:44:32,840
Scott: It's pretty much never positive for your company.

614
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:40,988
Scott: I've not seen a lot of positive interactions where people are like, oh man company X is just really great about honoring and paying out Bounties, they're so great to work with.

615
00:44:41,068 --> 00:44:43,840
Scott: I let you know, it's like no because it's an exploitative system.

616
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,660
Scott: No one's ever gonna be happy, you know being on the under the bounty finding.

617
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:50,856
Rym: There's some numbers in this verge article going to link to.

618
00:44:50,897 --> 00:44:55,132
Rym: they surveyed 600,000 people on one of these bug bounty platforms and out of 600,000.

619
00:44:55,132 --> 00:45:04,820
Rym: Let's see 146 of them have never made more than $100,000 and like annual income in their lifetime on the platform.

620
00:45:07,161 --> 00:45:12,540
Scott: I think I think a lot of people on those platforms like sign up poke at something and go away, right?

621
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:15,140
Scott: How many how many of the users are like actual?

622
00:45:15,662 --> 00:45:23,207
Scott: People who have decided to stay home and find vulnerabilities and have the technological skills Necessary to actually do so.

623
00:45:23,287 --> 00:45:29,490
Rym: it points out that the starting salary for an entry-level Penetration tester is more than $100,000 a year.

624
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:37,135
Scott: That is correct But there are enough of those jobs To go around because it's like because the companies won't pay for it.

625
00:45:37,175 --> 00:45:41,146
Rym: if they were gonna pay for it They wouldn't have these bug bounty programs Right.

626
00:45:41,186 --> 00:45:42,200
Scott: Well, I mean that's what I'm saying.

627
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:55,580
Scott: The only legit purpose of them is what I said before which is to you know if there is the criminal out there to give them a second thought to do the Responsible disclosure and still get paid as opposed to going down the path of crime, right?

628
00:45:55,700 --> 00:46:00,980
Scott: It shouldn't be a path where that's someone's job right through by a gig economy.

629
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,960
Scott: Yeah, it shouldn't be a replacement for employees.

630
00:46:04,662 --> 00:46:14,839
Rym: I feel like every one of these gig gig economy type things should be heavily regulated in ways that Effectively force these platforms to pay a minimum wage or shut them down.

631
00:46:15,622 --> 00:46:17,428
Scott: But also a minimum wage is not enough for this.

632
00:46:17,468 --> 00:46:20,257
Rym: I said a minimum wage not the current minimum wage.

633
00:46:20,658 --> 00:46:25,193
Rym: Yeah Anyway, like $25 an hour like modern minimum.

634
00:46:25,313 --> 00:46:26,116
Rym: How many our eyes.

635
00:46:26,136 --> 00:46:26,838
Scott: so I find a bug.

636
00:46:26,878 --> 00:46:29,739
Scott: in five minutes I get lucky and I said I spent a week on it.

637
00:46:30,941 --> 00:46:41,939
Rym: Well, you know how actually a lot of contracts handle that like generally the way that's handled in most industries is Any amount of work is rounded up to some large increment like four or eight hours.

638
00:46:42,695 --> 00:46:45,136
Scott: Yeah But I think really what it is.

639
00:46:45,217 --> 00:46:45,620
Rym: details.

640
00:46:46,202 --> 00:46:50,360
Scott: Yeah is you know for me if I was a company and I wanted to do anything like this, right?

641
00:46:50,440 --> 00:47:02,580
Scott: It's like I know the only people who are really using my software a lot right are It's the customers right and I'm only really going to be doing this if I have like an enterprise non free software.

642
00:47:03,262 --> 00:47:09,820
Rym: If I was though an enterprise software I could consider like what I would do a discount program to my customers.

643
00:47:10,469 --> 00:47:11,200
Scott: Right, I would do it.

644
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,514
Scott: I would do this with my customers because that would be.

645
00:47:13,534 --> 00:47:22,689
Scott: it would basically be like hey Customers if you find something by accident because you're working so closely with my software Please don't crime us and ruin us, right?

646
00:47:22,709 --> 00:47:23,652
Scott: Yeah, I'll pay you.

647
00:47:23,672 --> 00:47:28,372
Scott: I wouldn't go out to the whole world and say hey Does anyone want an informal job?

648
00:47:28,392 --> 00:47:29,277
Scott: or you know?

649
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:33,320
Scott: Criminals who are ignoring my software don't realize it even exists.

650
00:47:33,501 --> 00:47:36,613
Scott: Please come and find things wrong with it that I don't have time to fix.

651
00:47:36,733 --> 00:47:38,059
Scott: It's like I wouldn't do any of that, right?

652
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,424
Scott: So, yeah, that's that's what's up with those.

653
00:47:41,585 --> 00:47:45,536
Scott: Yeah, so you do find something wrong in some software.

654
00:47:45,716 --> 00:47:47,770
Rym: Yeah bounties notwithstanding What do you do?

655
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:49,504
Scott: Mm-hmm.

656
00:47:49,524 --> 00:47:53,241
Rym: That's oh, I don't know what we are yet in 2009.

657
00:47:53,241 --> 00:47:56,334
Scott: I don't know what we said in 2009, but you know, it really depends.

658
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:57,699
Scott: Maybe crime is the right answer.

659
00:47:58,081 --> 00:48:04,600
Rym: Yeah, well, I mean, I guess there's always the argument to be made with any exploits that someone finds on their own.

660
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:22,060
Rym: We're not talking about someone who like hacked into a source code repository and like did crime to find this data but what about someone who is intelligent and Educated and had publicly information publicly available information and from all of that They find a serious exploit in some software

661
00:48:22,683 --> 00:48:24,531
Scott: Yeah, and a good example of how to fight.

662
00:48:24,551 --> 00:48:26,640
Scott: you might say oh well, you never find anything by accident.

663
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:35,176
Scott: but actually there have been a couple times in my life for real where I've been like using some software and I've Accidentally ended up logged in as a different user.

664
00:48:35,256 --> 00:48:40,780
Scott: That wasn't me Yeah, and at least one of those times I figured out how to reproduce it, right?

665
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:42,617
Scott: I was like, oh that's how it happened.

666
00:48:42,638 --> 00:48:50,503
Rym: now I was able to log into other people's scheduling during the hell day once Mm-hmm.

667
00:48:51,486 --> 00:48:53,593
Scott: Yeah, it's like I. just it just happened right?

668
00:48:53,653 --> 00:48:54,095
Scott: It wasn't like.

669
00:48:54,135 --> 00:48:55,680
Scott: I was actively looking for it.

670
00:48:55,740 --> 00:49:01,600
Scott: I wasn't like and mapping their server and trying to do all kinds of dirt, you know dirty biz, right?

671
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:06,160
Scott: It's just like a thing happened and then I just figured it out over the course of computer usage.

672
00:49:06,762 --> 00:49:16,420
Rym: But even if you figure it out on purpose like figuring out how to pick a lock is not a crime It's only a crime when you pick someone else's lock that you don't own to go in and do something with it.

673
00:49:16,721 --> 00:49:18,859
Rym: But describing how to pick a lock not a crime?

674
00:49:19,621 --> 00:49:20,606
Scott: Nope, not at all.

675
00:49:20,867 --> 00:49:22,595
Rym: So describing how an exploit works.

676
00:49:22,896 --> 00:49:23,580
Rym: Is that a crime?

677
00:49:24,861 --> 00:49:32,680
Scott: No, probably not all right, but almost all exploits so we see these days are some sort of like buffer overflow memory protection.

678
00:49:33,121 --> 00:49:34,887
Scott: In a situation they're all.

679
00:49:35,007 --> 00:49:38,740
Scott: it's like it's like you're seeing the same exploits types over and over again.

680
00:49:38,921 --> 00:49:40,940
Scott: It's just where they exist, right?

681
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,588
Scott: It's oh they exist at this memory location in this program.

682
00:49:43,629 --> 00:49:51,220
Scott: in this situation, right or oh this program in this situation Oh, there's an SQL injection in this form and this spot, right?

683
00:49:51,541 --> 00:49:55,294
Scott: It's like it's the same types of exploits in computer software over and over again.

684
00:49:55,315 --> 00:49:56,760
Scott: There aren't a lot of new kinds.

685
00:49:57,444 --> 00:49:58,954
Scott: It's just where are they?

686
00:49:59,054 --> 00:49:59,920
Scott: in which programs?

687
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:05,980
Rym: Well, like we said most exploits are act like the real exploits in terms of just how do you exploit a company's software?

688
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:09,014
Rym: Most exploits are social engineering inside jobs anyway.

689
00:50:09,677 --> 00:50:19,598
Scott: Yeah They're also, you know rumors of exploits that are like I think I read something recently about like fake Cisco routers that they they were.

690
00:50:19,678 --> 00:50:26,500
Scott: you know Someone was selling bootleg Cisco routers and they found out when they tried to do like a firmware update It didn't work that it wasn't a legit route.

691
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:31,800
Rym: I have been on the receiving end of gray market routers before yeah, right and then it all made.

692
00:50:32,181 --> 00:50:37,760
Scott: Oh, they heavily inspected those routers and they didn't find any backdoors in them that they found.

693
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:52,346
Scott: So we presume that it was just someone trying to make money selling bootlegs, but could have been yeah, right Kevin And that's not something you could like find and get a bounty on Yep, but I got like a software bug.

694
00:50:52,747 --> 00:50:57,220
Rym: I think it really comes down to like especially in 2020. and what's going on right now?

695
00:50:58,341 --> 00:51:01,973
Rym: What are the what will happen if you share this information?

696
00:51:02,394 --> 00:51:04,160
Rym: and is that an outcome that you?

697
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:07,239
Rym: Personally believe in and would stand behind?

698
00:51:07,943 --> 00:51:12,606
Rym: Case in point say you figure out a way to I don't know Like.

699
00:51:12,666 --> 00:51:25,057
Rym: you find a police Server that's public with like public information and you find a way to dump out a ton of information that shows some malfeasance of the police department.

700
00:51:27,082 --> 00:51:30,880
Rym: Maybe you feel comfortable sharing the details of that exploit in the wild.

701
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:33,605
Rym: maybe Maybe like.

702
00:51:33,987 --> 00:51:35,940
Rym: maybe you just you feel comfortable doing that.

703
00:51:36,402 --> 00:51:36,644
Rym: Is it?

704
00:51:36,765 --> 00:51:39,058
Rym: is it not your right to share some?

705
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:43,500
Rym: Texts and opinions that you have on the internet without a specific call to action?

706
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:48,256
Scott: You'll have to do that in such a way as to remain anonymous, right?

707
00:51:48,276 --> 00:51:49,079
Scott: They don't know who done it.

708
00:51:49,703 --> 00:51:50,853
Scott: Otherwise you'd be in big trouble.

709
00:51:51,035 --> 00:51:55,040
Scott: Yeah You know, but let's say, you know back in the day.

710
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,108
Scott: I feel like you know, it's like what would people do?

711
00:51:57,128 --> 00:52:06,960
Scott: it feels like on the one hand back in the day The people who managed to find software exploits were simultaneously more malicious and also less, right?

712
00:52:07,661 --> 00:52:10,511
Scott: Yeah, it's like what are you gonna do in 1990?

713
00:52:10,511 --> 00:52:12,258
Scott: something with it with a software exploit?

714
00:52:12,298 --> 00:52:24,145
Scott: It's like alright I'm gonna pirate some software I got pirate games or I'm gonna make someone's hard drive explode or delete all their data or make a funny skull bounce around their screen or Right.

715
00:52:24,507 --> 00:52:25,474
Scott: Whereas nowadays.

716
00:52:25,514 --> 00:52:26,260
Scott: It's like what are you gonna do?

717
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:39,847
Scott: I'm gonna take all this massive amount of data from a big company that that's very, you know, like Experian or whatever the credit bureaus a dark web and selling a dark web ruining a whole bunch of people Getting identity theft on them.

718
00:52:39,867 --> 00:52:41,635
Scott: I'm gonna you know ruin.

719
00:52:41,736 --> 00:52:42,560
Scott: take people's money.

720
00:52:43,362 --> 00:52:45,851
Scott: It's like actual crimes now, right?

721
00:52:45,891 --> 00:52:48,380
Scott: It's like no one's computers are exploding, right?

722
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:48,802
Scott: It's like.

723
00:52:48,822 --> 00:52:55,177
Scott: it's like less evil in that way, but it's more evil and like hey You're doing harmful crimes and not just pirate in some video game.

724
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:56,162
Rym: now It's interesting.

725
00:52:56,182 --> 00:52:59,860
Rym: what I do remember especially in the 90s like one of this discourse was happening.

726
00:53:00,503 --> 00:53:08,634
Rym: I remember a lot of stories of people who would Responsibly disclose directly to companies in general like.

727
00:53:08,654 --> 00:53:10,200
Rym: that was the thing people would do and talk about.

728
00:53:10,762 --> 00:53:18,399
Rym: But there was definitely a long-term set of chatter around the fact that companies Basically ignored these and never fix bugs like they.

729
00:53:18,459 --> 00:53:21,851
Scott: yep That's that's exactly what the problem with the bug bounty thing is.

730
00:53:21,871 --> 00:53:30,996
Scott: right is like it's only bad press for you even if you handle it perfectly because You know, you have to constantly be handling all these people who are sending in stuff, right?

731
00:53:32,901 --> 00:53:36,860
Rym: Yeah, but also the person who finds the bug is a security researcher.

732
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:40,694
Rym: They want to write an article about this exploit because that's how they make their their living.

733
00:53:41,055 --> 00:53:46,360
Rym: being an expert in this space They're gonna advise other people on this kind of exploit and they're gonna give you time.

734
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,148
Scott: They're gonna say hey, you know you.

735
00:53:48,188 --> 00:53:50,680
Scott: let me know when you fix this so I can publish my article.

736
00:53:50,901 --> 00:53:52,739
Scott: Yeah, right, you know you have all that you're right.

737
00:53:52,941 --> 00:53:55,089
Scott: And so when you fixed it I can publish my article.

738
00:53:55,531 --> 00:54:00,287
Scott: everyone can see and this you'll see articles like this Especially on sites like F secure or whatever, right?

739
00:54:00,307 --> 00:54:03,155
Scott: They're like, hey, we found this security vulnerability.

740
00:54:03,435 --> 00:54:04,117
Scott: We reported it.

741
00:54:04,398 --> 00:54:04,980
Scott: They fixed it.

742
00:54:05,404 --> 00:54:06,599
Scott: Here's an explanation of it.

743
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:11,759
Scott: So that way you can write your software better and not make the same mistake that they did and that's very valuable stuff.

744
00:54:12,801 --> 00:54:18,141
Scott: but if they just don't fix it for a long time for whatever reason and there's a lot of reasons you worked at a Company.

745
00:54:18,162 --> 00:54:21,620
Scott: how many bugs you got just sitting in the bug hopper never fixed, right?

746
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,795
Rym: I will say is that remember that anecdote about how I got my previous job.

747
00:54:24,815 --> 00:54:35,345
Rym: I Was in the position where as a product manager I looked at a JIRA backlog and I saw a whole bunch of bugs raised by Some motherfucker named Rym to cost her.

748
00:54:35,365 --> 00:54:40,054
Rym: Yeah, and I looked at all of them and chose not to fix most of them.

749
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:52,313
Rym: I Remember that day explicitly because the CEO was like wait, wait, wait Wait, wait, cuz he noticed and he asked me about it and it was.

750
00:54:52,453 --> 00:54:53,155
Rym: it was a funny day.

751
00:54:53,175 --> 00:55:00,597
Scott: It's funny stuff Right, but the point is if you had not been hired if you were still on the outside waiting, right?

752
00:55:00,617 --> 00:55:01,260
Scott: You're getting mad.

753
00:55:01,581 --> 00:55:02,526
Scott: Yeah, getting mad.

754
00:55:03,068 --> 00:55:04,696
Rym: I mean all those stories in the 90s.

755
00:55:04,737 --> 00:55:12,404
Rym: the Pattern seemed to be someone would end up posting anonymously on like one of the old Bulletin boards of the day.

756
00:55:12,424 --> 00:55:14,190
Rym: Hey, here's an exploit.

757
00:55:14,411 --> 00:55:16,538
Rym: I told Microsoft about this for like three years.

758
00:55:16,558 --> 00:55:17,240
Rym: They didn't do shit.

759
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:27,440
Rym: Have fun because yep, even if there was no bounty or anything on the line if a lot of hackers I assume this mentality is still there you find something like that.

760
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:28,884
Rym: You feel like you did the right thing.

761
00:55:28,904 --> 00:55:33,176
Rym: you get ignored you get aggrieved and eventually you take revenge.

762
00:55:33,297 --> 00:55:34,480
Rym: That's a common pattern.

763
00:55:35,124 --> 00:55:37,980
Scott: I mean, that's just a common pattern in all humanity, right?

764
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:38,521
Scott: Is it?

765
00:55:38,662 --> 00:55:43,820
Scott: yeah people feel that some you know, they have been the victim of even a small injustice, right?

766
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,146
Scott: They get angry, right?

767
00:55:45,166 --> 00:55:47,880
Scott: So it's like hey, I did the right thing and the thing nothing happened.

768
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:49,226
Scott: I expected a thing to happen.

769
00:55:49,266 --> 00:55:50,430
Scott: It didn't happen now.

770
00:55:50,451 --> 00:55:52,700
Scott: I'm mad a little bit mad at least maybe a lot.

771
00:55:53,243 --> 00:55:57,744
Rym: Pending the mystically is like hey, we should build a navy and Athens is like no We don't need a navy.

772
00:55:57,764 --> 00:56:01,878
Rym: and then a naval invasion comes and the mystically is like I fucking told you right?

773
00:56:01,898 --> 00:56:04,323
Scott: He met You mad?

774
00:56:05,789 --> 00:56:08,660
Rym: I am still mad on the mystic Lisa's behalf to this day.

775
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:14,265
Scott: Rightfully so mad right.

776
00:56:14,285 --> 00:56:24,060
Scott: so and think about how mad you would be if you know you read some text Explaining some bug bounty program that said you should get a hundred thousand dollars and you ended up with zero dollars.

777
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:24,883
Scott: Yeah way mad.

778
00:56:25,204 --> 00:56:26,949
Rym: They're like, no your exploit is good.

779
00:56:27,210 --> 00:56:29,056
Rym: But here's a bunch of nonsense.

780
00:56:29,076 --> 00:56:30,180
Rym: That doesn't actually make sense.

781
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:31,344
Rym: Anyway, we're not paying you right?

782
00:56:31,826 --> 00:56:32,488
Scott: Yeah, I've seen.

783
00:56:32,528 --> 00:56:36,441
Scott: I've seen recently someone be like, yeah, I got $100,000 of stuff I'm gonna.

784
00:56:36,562 --> 00:56:37,445
Scott: I said they didn't pay me.

785
00:56:37,485 --> 00:56:38,228
Scott: I'm gonna release it.

786
00:56:38,288 --> 00:56:41,399
Scott: and then Microsoft Twitter was like, uh, let's talk.

787
00:56:43,123 --> 00:56:44,739
Scott: It's like why did you talk earlier?

788
00:56:45,101 --> 00:56:49,012
Rym: Yeah, but it comes down to that the public it's almost like this.

789
00:56:49,113 --> 00:56:50,557
Rym: that example which we'll link to.

790
00:56:50,597 --> 00:56:51,520
Rym: you can read the Twitter thread.

791
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:52,203
Rym: It's pretty funny.

792
00:56:52,524 --> 00:56:56,700
Rym: That's an example of the company doesn't care until PR comes on the line.

793
00:56:57,061 --> 00:57:03,104
Rym: But in this case the company made the PR problem in the first place by even having the bug bounty program Yep.

794
00:57:03,888 --> 00:57:06,199
Scott: So yeah, so I guess the I'm hungry now.

795
00:57:07,323 --> 00:57:18,424
Scott: If you're if you're a company don't make a bug bounty program unless you are sure it's the right thing that you actually need Right that it fits your situation Rarely, it rarely does.

796
00:57:18,624 --> 00:57:21,693
Rym: if your rationale is we can't afford to pay pen testers.

797
00:57:22,054 --> 00:57:23,477
Rym: That is not adequate.

798
00:57:24,219 --> 00:57:39,710
Scott: No to do not go and try to find bugs as like in bug bounty programs to thinking that you'll make a living doing that even if you're good at it because a lot of companies won't pay out and you'll have to either crime or Blackmail the companies to get money and it's not worth it.

799
00:57:39,771 --> 00:57:40,895
Scott: Just get you have those skills.

800
00:57:41,176 --> 00:57:43,346
Scott: Just get a job You have the skills.

801
00:57:43,466 --> 00:57:45,415
Scott: or open up a consultancy or something.

802
00:57:45,435 --> 00:57:46,580
Scott: All right, you have the skills.

803
00:57:46,641 --> 00:57:47,959
Scott: It's why I don't need to do this.

804
00:57:48,042 --> 00:57:54,720
Rym: No It's still part of our capitalist hellscape to use those sites to find bugs to go after just to build your own resume.

805
00:57:55,282 --> 00:57:57,433
Rym: But that is also exploitative.

806
00:57:57,493 --> 00:58:02,400
Rym: just it's less exploitative Than the people who are forced to try to make a living with it, right?

807
00:58:02,561 --> 00:58:06,460
Scott: And if you do find something by accident or on purpose, right, you know.

808
00:58:06,721 --> 00:58:25,180
Scott: Try to follow your conscience and the best practices for revealing or not revealing that to the company That is responsible or and or the world and or criminals, you know based on the situation I hope that you're a good person and you'll do the the right thing and not some shady thing that hurts people.

809
00:58:25,442 --> 00:58:27,540
Rym: Do the right thing if you disclose.

810
00:58:27,881 --> 00:58:37,360
Rym: Disclose because it will help the right people and or harm the right people And if you don't disclose do that because it will help the right people.

811
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:39,741
Rym: It's.

812
00:58:39,922 --> 00:58:49,060
Rym: it's interesting and I say that with a little bit of you know That most of these broad tech subjects like what should you do in X situation?

813
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:50,964
Rym: Actually come down to ethics.

814
00:58:51,145 --> 00:58:53,494
Rym: One of the things that almost no tech school actually teaches.

815
00:58:53,514 --> 00:58:55,969
Scott: I had ethics classes I waited to are.

816
00:58:55,989 --> 00:58:57,059
Rym: we went to a great tech school.

817
00:58:58,006 --> 00:59:00,952
Rym: Okay Alright, I am also hungry.

818
00:59:01,093 --> 00:59:01,800
Scott: So I hunger.

819
00:59:03,543 --> 00:59:06,060
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

820
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:10,859
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

821
00:59:11,181 --> 00:59:16,200
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at front row crew comm for show notes discussion news and more.

822
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:23,880
Rym: Remember GeekNights is not one but four different shows sci-tech Mondays gaming Tuesdays anime comic Wednesdays and indiscriminate Thursdays.

823
00:59:24,241 --> 00:59:27,416
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons attribution 3.0 license.

824
00:59:28,661 --> 00:59:31,774
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

825
00:59:31,954 --> 00:59:42,975
Rym: But unlike those other late shows It's actually recorded at night and the patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights are Alan Joyce I didn't nickel Marty green yet.

826
00:59:42,995 --> 00:59:43,758
Rym: Just like a dude guy.

827
00:59:43,778 --> 00:59:46,430
Rym: We make this bigger because I can't read all these names.

828
00:59:46,711 --> 00:59:47,214
Rym: There we go.

829
00:59:47,535 --> 00:59:48,279
Rym: He's our television.

830
00:59:48,781 --> 00:59:49,344
Rym: Graham Finch.

831
00:59:49,485 --> 00:59:50,450
Rym: You will the key to my heart.

832
00:59:50,772 --> 00:59:52,744
Rym: She gave me a kiss and she gave me my ticket.

833
00:59:52,985 --> 00:59:58,685
Rym: Clinton Walton J Banch from from New Zealand Ryan Perrin Nicholas Brando Chris mink if the thirst for hydrated Gannon dread.

834
00:59:58,785 --> 01:00:13,084
Rym: Lily Tenebra Chris Reimer Finn Sean Klein Shervin Monroe and a bunch of people who do not want me to say their names might have noticed I uploaded the next Installation of me and Emily reviewing every Disney theatrical animated feature with Bambi.

835
01:00:13,465 --> 01:00:23,349
Rym: Bambi is a hundred percent worth watching If you haven't seen it since you were a kid and we are moving right along with Salados amigos and the three Caballeros, so stay tuned for that.

836
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:27,979
Rym: otherwise we are like I said gonna be performing at all these online cons.

837
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:53,440
Rym: our Pre-production on some other internal shows got delayed a little bit partly because the logistics of recording the panels that we are going to present at these online cons is proving a challenge and We have to sort out that pipeline first because unlike the utenna show the next episode which we are working on There's a deadline for being able to perform a panel live at like the crunchyroll Expo.

838
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:57,560
Rym: So stay tuned for some brand new panel content.

839
01:00:57,641 --> 01:01:00,100
Rym: We're doing pretty much brand new panels and all these things.

840
01:01:00,521 --> 01:01:05,600
Rym: I'm pretty excited about what magfest is up to so stay tuned for them to announce what that's gonna look like.

841
01:01:06,081 --> 01:01:09,554
Rym: But anyway for now for today this Monday.

842
01:01:09,574 --> 01:01:13,446
Rym: I leave you With old gray man.

843
01:01:13,486 --> 01:01:18,279
Rym: She ain't what she used to be ain't what she used to be ain't what she used to be.

844
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:24,876
Rym: Grandma she ain't what she used to be ain't what she used to be ain't what she used to be.

845
01:01:25,257 --> 01:01:27,798
Scott: and now the crazy old man singers.

846
01:01:29,561 --> 01:01:32,839
Rym: She ain't what she used to be ain't what she used to be.
