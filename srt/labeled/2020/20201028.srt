1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,332
Rym: It's Wednesday October 28th 2020.

2
00:00:12,332 --> 00:00:12,774
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,794 --> 00:00:15,923
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:15,963 --> 00:00:16,786
Rym: We are reviewing.

5
00:00:16,866 --> 00:00:18,190
Rym: the comic is Sola.

6
00:00:19,751 --> 00:00:20,788
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:22,472 --> 00:00:26,749
Rym: So, uh, I actually went and voted yesterday, you know, they went out to actually do the early voting in person.

8
00:00:28,174 --> 00:00:34,827
Rym: mostly I voted in person because You're outdoors like 99% of the time and considering all the trouble with mail-in ballots.

9
00:00:34,887 --> 00:00:45,110
Rym: I didn't want to risk Anything about my vote being counted and I wanted I think I said this during the results They're gonna release almost immediately after the polls close.

10
00:00:45,735 --> 00:00:55,409
Scott: I think I said this before but you know My mail-in ballot was already confirmed received because I mailed it so long ago, but I may just go vote in person Which is a thing you can legally do in New York.

11
00:00:55,659 --> 00:01:06,789
Scott: Yeah Even if you've sent in a mail-in ballot and what's supposed to happen is when they receive Your when they go to open the mail-in ballots, they'll see that I voted in person and throw it out And if for some reason they make a mistake

12
00:01:08,491 --> 00:01:08,872
Rym: It's

13
00:01:08,892 --> 00:01:09,394
Scott: not a very.

14
00:01:09,454 --> 00:01:12,966
Scott: if I have there's a non-zero chance that I can legally vote twice.

15
00:01:13,026 --> 00:01:13,990
Scott: Why would I not do that?

16
00:01:15,231 --> 00:01:23,230
Rym: It is amazing how different this is in every state Which is like just one of those things is wrong with America and people who didn't grow up.

17
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:28,665
Scott: It's wrong with America, but it does provide a unique defense against election interference.

18
00:01:28,706 --> 00:01:31,634
Scott: That is true when we are facing Yep, like.

19
00:01:31,894 --> 00:01:44,784
Rym: it'd be really hard to hack the American election because every state is so radically different that like There's a centralized well-designed voting system, you could just attack it directly.

20
00:01:44,864 --> 00:01:46,429
Scott: the surface area is one thing.

21
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,075
Scott: now The surface area is okay.

22
00:01:48,456 --> 00:01:53,024
Scott: You have to attack two hundred and something electoral votes worth of systems Yep.

23
00:01:53,551 --> 00:01:57,524
Rym: But also in terms of like our voting the biggest problem in America right now.

24
00:01:57,564 --> 00:02:12,150
Rym: for those of you who might be outside of this nightmare late capitalist hellscape or at least adjacent to the late capitalist hellscape It's a global hellscape, but our election one of the problems we face Is that a lot of states if you vote by mail?

25
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:18,650
Rym: They're not even legally allowed to open those envelopes until the morning of the day of the election.

26
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:22,121
Rym: They can't even get a head start on counting them like.

27
00:02:22,402 --> 00:02:24,630
Rym: nonsense like that is a problem in America.

28
00:02:25,192 --> 00:02:32,663
Rym: So anyway, we went to vote and the amazing thing was we tried to vote on Sunday When it opened and there was like a four-hour line.

29
00:02:32,683 --> 00:02:33,225
Rym: So we bailed.

30
00:02:33,727 --> 00:02:40,330
Rym: we went yesterday Like near the end of the day, but before people actually got off work to try to early vote like in the evening.

31
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:45,844
Rym: But while people might still be busy and there was a huge line But it was actually only about a two-hour wait.

32
00:02:45,904 --> 00:02:46,689
Rym: So we stayed in it.

33
00:02:47,492 --> 00:02:53,350
Rym: I have never in my life encountered a line that was longer than like ten minutes to vote until this.

34
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,379
Scott: You know, we know we know what the factors are, right?

35
00:02:55,399 --> 00:02:58,030
Scott: So one is obviously more enthusiasm.

36
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:05,150
Scott: Factor two is the early voting in New York has one-tenth of the locations of this is the regular voting.

37
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,797
Scott: Yeah on Tuesday Election Day.

38
00:03:06,817 --> 00:03:09,729
Scott: There are gonna be ten times as many places to go vote, right?

39
00:03:11,611 --> 00:03:20,510
Scott: Problem three which you just described to me is that when you go to vote when they're at on Election Day You're going to a specific place that knows who's coming.

40
00:03:20,718 --> 00:03:22,858
Scott: Yeah And they have the ballots ready.

41
00:03:22,918 --> 00:03:30,430
Scott: because for that location when you go to early vote They're dealing with such a wider geographic area and different possible ballots.

42
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:34,270
Scott: Yeah, and since they don't know who's coming they're printing the ballots on demand.

43
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:41,377
Scott: So you have to go up to them and say mom in district X would number whatever and then they print a ballot appropriate for where you live

44
00:03:41,658 --> 00:03:49,250
Rym: and that's a problem especially in New York City because Like do you know how many congressional districts are within like a short walk of my apartment?

45
00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:55,210
Scott: Yeah, I mean I can walk, you know, most people I think in the United States, right?

46
00:03:55,915 --> 00:04:04,797
Scott: to walk to a place represented by a different member of the federal House of Representatives would be Extremely arduous.

47
00:04:04,817 --> 00:04:06,547
Rym: some states just have one like.

48
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:12,670
Scott: yeah I can take a subway and go through like a whole pile of them.

49
00:04:12,851 --> 00:04:13,498
Rym: In fact, I did.

50
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:20,938
Rym: I did this one time I was I took one of my Strava rides and I looked to see how many Congressional representatives I passed through.

51
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:24,570
Rym: it was four different congressional districts on that bike ride.

52
00:04:25,411 --> 00:04:31,562
Scott: Yeah, I mean I might commute this like at least three or four Some significant number right?

53
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:32,510
Scott: It might even be more than that.

54
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:36,930
Rym: Yeah, because the Maloney district actually goes across into part of Manhattan and part of Midtown.

55
00:04:37,252 --> 00:04:40,732
Rym: I'm actually still in that district longer than you might expect Mm-hmm.

56
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:42,278
Rym: But yeah, so we go.

57
00:04:42,539 --> 00:04:43,342
Rym: we wait two hours.

58
00:04:43,363 --> 00:04:45,130
Rym: There's a long long crowd line.

59
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:52,283
Rym: I'm confident based on who is in that line that 99.9% of the people are correctly voting for Joe Biden.

60
00:04:52,303 --> 00:04:53,910
Rym: like there were not some people in that line.

61
00:04:55,453 --> 00:04:56,550
Rym: There's only one part of the year.

62
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:05,230
Rym: well two parts of New York City that vote for Republicans one of those parts of Staten Island which fuck them and the other part is like this one neighborhood in Brooklyn.

63
00:05:05,452 --> 00:05:06,502
Rym: It's the only one.

64
00:05:06,542 --> 00:05:07,330
Rym: it's kind of amazing.

65
00:05:07,772 --> 00:05:08,494
Rym: But I go in.

66
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:10,100
Rym: Emily gets a ballot goes to vote.

67
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,950
Rym: because they're in New York each ballot is serialized.

68
00:05:13,211 --> 00:05:21,060
Rym: So they have the list of like the number of people who voted and they can serialize that to the number of ballots that were Handed out and then scanned.

69
00:05:21,301 --> 00:05:23,010
Rym: that's one of those like checks on the system.

70
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:27,830
Rym: Like if those numbers mismatch, they need to do a manual count of the ballots themselves and figure out what happened.

71
00:05:28,392 --> 00:05:35,379
Rym: So I take my ballot that came out of this machine and I go over vote and I fill out the first part of it And then I flip it over because there's a second side.

72
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,889
Scott: second side is to blame this side, too.

73
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,298
Rym: So I go over a voting person there.

74
00:05:41,318 --> 00:05:46,278
Rym: I'm like, yeah, my ballots broken and she's like, oh shit She says she literally goes.

75
00:05:46,298 --> 00:05:46,720
Rym: Oh shit.

76
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:52,410
Rym: So because now this cause it is no shit how much paperwork they had to fill out because of this.

77
00:05:53,531 --> 00:05:58,363
Rym: Yes, right the ballot that I had from the record and someone's worried about.

78
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:01,499
Scott: people are worried about so-called voting fraud Right.

79
00:06:01,621 --> 00:06:11,689
Scott: It's like You gotta get past some old lady who's working the polling station in Queens Probably been doing it for like all this paperwork to get one vote past them.

80
00:06:13,613 --> 00:06:14,908
Scott: It's it's really not easy.

81
00:06:15,191 --> 00:06:20,370
Rym: Okay, so what's your guess on how many people I do officially interact with to get a new ballot?

82
00:06:21,351 --> 00:06:32,230
Scott: Mean when I go to polling stations in the city, there's usually only Like there'll be two people at the table of find your district because you don't know it for some reason.

83
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:35,180
Scott: Then there's two people at the table of here's your ballot.

84
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,370
Rym: Yeah, then there's always one person at the provisional ballot Like I need to sign an affidavit.

85
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:47,252
Scott: Then there's the person who's help you while you're voting person and that is the help you with the scanner and give you a sticker Person.

86
00:06:47,392 --> 00:06:47,995
Scott: yeah, right.

87
00:06:48,437 --> 00:06:51,107
Scott: So I mean maybe two or three five.

88
00:06:52,131 --> 00:07:06,948
Rym: I interacted by five people who each person had to take me to another person so I could explain what happened to me to both of them and then the second person would take it from there and go over to another person who had a different function.

89
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:27,409
Rym: and Eventually, we got to the person who's responsible for the machine that prints the ballots Which is in this big lockbox and that person had to key a whole bunch of information into a tiny keypad On the outside of this box to make the machine print another ballot for me And then he had to take my fucked-up ballot and do a bunch of stuff with it somewhere.

90
00:07:28,471 --> 00:07:29,638
Rym: All right, and it'll work.

91
00:07:30,221 --> 00:07:35,684
Scott: sure it doesn't get used because you know It's legal to say fill out the front half and just abstain on the back half.

92
00:07:35,765 --> 00:07:37,230
Rym: Yeah, there was no ban.

93
00:07:38,355 --> 00:07:41,570
Scott: Yes, someone could have scanned that ballot and you know double-voted or whatever.

94
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:53,285
Rym: Yep, so I voted for Joe Biden under the working parties family line because working families party line because New York is weird Yep, and otherwise straight Democrats because they're the only party interested in governing.

95
00:07:53,626 --> 00:08:00,682
Rym: So I urge you If you have not voted yet, and you're an American Do what you need to do.

96
00:08:00,803 --> 00:08:01,347
Rym: go do it.

97
00:08:02,454 --> 00:08:05,630
Scott: If you have to skip, you know work and make some sacrifice somewhere.

98
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:08,005
Scott: But if you're legally allowed to do it do it.

99
00:08:08,126 --> 00:08:17,993
Rym: Yeah, you know me I won't stand in line at a Starbucks if there's more than one person in front of me But I stood in that two fucking hour line to vote in a state that literally doesn't matter Because

100
00:08:18,194 --> 00:08:21,250
Scott: I still think you could have waited until on Tuesday.

101
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:31,101
Scott: I think the lines will be way shorter because even though enthusiasm is high still and that will definitely Increase enthusiastic people are more likely to vote early.

102
00:08:31,342 --> 00:08:33,970
Scott: right people had all this opportunity to vote early.

103
00:08:35,111 --> 00:08:42,760
Scott: So those people aren't showing up Tuesday and there's gonna be ten times as many locations to go to and those locations Won't have to print ballots on demand.

104
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,490
Scott: They'll just have stacks of them right up for you.

105
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:53,610
Rym: Honestly, my reason was one if anything happens like let's say I get hit by a bus before Election Day I still want voted before I get hit by that bus because that the stakes are that high.

106
00:08:54,751 --> 00:09:02,852
Scott: Yeah, there's a lot of people are posting on Twitter like, you know, pretty much, you know every possible inspirational story of someone voting Despite hardship.

107
00:09:02,933 --> 00:09:05,921
Scott: I've seen hundred-year-old person vote.

108
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:13,597
Scott: I've seen I've seen dude with terminal illness Fusion voting right?

109
00:09:13,697 --> 00:09:21,001
Scott: It's like for you know, it's like someone like, you know Like in the worst possible shape right going out of their way to vote.

110
00:09:21,081 --> 00:09:28,688
Scott: and the idea is if that person can vote And you're listening to this You Can do you can do it?

111
00:09:29,491 --> 00:09:29,872
Scott: You're not?

112
00:09:29,892 --> 00:09:32,058
Scott: hopefully hopefully you're not terminally ill.

113
00:09:32,098 --> 00:09:36,030
Scott: if you're terminally ill do not waste the rest of your short life listening to geek.

114
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:46,976
Rym: You can have someone drop an iPad into your coffin at that point If you have a cancer.

115
00:09:47,016 --> 00:09:51,050
Scott: that's in a late stage, I'm so sorry for you, but why are you wait?

116
00:09:51,151 --> 00:09:52,620
Scott: You're not gonna live that much longer.

117
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,284
Scott: Don't listen.

118
00:09:53,304 --> 00:09:56,638
Rym: We're gonna get an email Keeping me going as GeekNights.

119
00:09:56,838 --> 00:10:01,970
Scott: go eat a delicious food or you know Talk to the people that are important to you or something.

120
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:04,842
Rym: I guess what I would say is one thing you can't know about someone circumstance cuz.

121
00:10:04,862 --> 00:10:06,267
Rym: we've gotten emails like that before.

122
00:10:06,287 --> 00:10:11,902

Scott: He's got nothing He can tell you.

127
00:10:25,032 --> 00:10:34,350
Rym: I'm saying if you're already at the point to where you're listening to this and that's your thing at the end Then I will actually talk to you on the phone like if that's what you really want.

128
00:10:36,672 --> 00:10:38,107

131
00:10:51,634 --> 00:10:55,468
Scott: He learned the name of that song was not the name that we thought it was.

132
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,762
Rym: Yeah I always knew it as the Toria Dora song.

Rym: I kind of assumed it was called Toria door.

136
00:11:02,904 --> 00:11:03,890
Rym: I knew it was from turn of dot.

137
00:11:04,392 --> 00:11:05,516
Rym: I didn't fucking know anything else about.

138
00:11:05,536 --> 00:11:06,681
Rym: it's not no turn.

139
00:11:06,721 --> 00:11:07,062
Rym: turn it out.

140
00:11:07,102 --> 00:11:08,046
Rym: It's from Carmen.

00:11:08,648 --> 00:11:09,090
Scott: That's right.

Rym: So that's enormous from turn of dot.

143
00:11:12,178 --> 00:11:15,390
Rym: I was literally playing the trumpet solo in this and Dorma last night.

144
00:11:16,874 --> 00:11:18,670
Rym: My mind anyway, all right.

145
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:23,730
Scott: So anyway, so I also because we're in posted that I also learned the name of the song wasn't the name?

146
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:28,554
Scott: I thought it was right and then I saw I'm like, you know I know that song.

147
00:11:28,614 --> 00:11:30,121
Scott: everyone knows that fucking song right.

148
00:11:30,562 --> 00:11:31,587
Scott: and I said what's it from?

149
00:11:31,627 --> 00:11:32,370
Scott: and I googled I'm like.

150
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:33,976
Scott: Oh, it's from Carmen Carmen is.

151
00:11:34,157 --> 00:11:35,763
Scott: I know the name of an opera.

152
00:11:35,783 --> 00:11:37,670
Scott: Yeah, have I seen Carmen?

153
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,254
Scott: No, have I?

154
00:11:39,315 --> 00:11:40,379
Scott: do I know the story of it?

155
00:11:40,439 --> 00:11:43,030
Scott: Yes, cuz I read it on Wikipedia today, right?

156
00:11:43,512 --> 00:11:47,025
Scott: I just knew it was a famous opera and I knew that that song was in it.

157
00:11:47,085 --> 00:11:58,388
Scott: and I said, you know I'm willing to bet this famous opera that I have never seen nor listened to probably contains other famous songs that I already know.

158
00:11:59,671 --> 00:11:59,972
Scott: It's like.

159
00:11:59,992 --> 00:12:03,563
Scott: it's like a guarantee pretty much right but it's like I know.

160
00:12:03,644 --> 00:12:05,730
Scott: I'm basically sitting there thinking I guarantee.

161
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:09,780
Scott: There are songs on the Carmen soundtrack right that I already know.

162
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:13,240
Scott: 100% chance at least one or two, right?

163
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,466
Scott: But which songs are they?

164
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:17,710
Scott: what it's like?

165
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,033
Scott: there's so many songs.

166
00:12:19,093 --> 00:12:21,379
Scott: It could be which ones is it?

167
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:21,981
Scott: Right.

168
00:12:22,543 --> 00:12:28,243
Scott: Let me go to Spotify and double-click on Carmen and find out right I The.

169
00:12:28,403 --> 00:12:31,940
Scott: what is the first thing I hear within the literal first note?

170
00:12:32,844 --> 00:12:33,687
Scott: Do you do you know Carmen?

171
00:12:33,707 --> 00:12:34,170
Scott: Have you seen it?

172
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,058
Rym: Because I haven't I have not actually seen it.

173
00:12:36,862 --> 00:12:55,417
Scott: The literal first song of Carmen is And I'm like, oh my god, I didn't even have to get to track fucking - Most of the opera scene are either terrible long-winded Wagner that I never want to see again or like Rossini stuff.

174
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:01,179
Scott: So the story of Carmen at least based on the cliff note summary doesn't seem very interesting.

175
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:01,782
Rym: You know what?

176
00:13:01,802 --> 00:13:02,246
Rym: I can tell you.

177
00:13:02,507 --> 00:13:09,580
Rym: my advice on opera is very simple Never choose which opera to see if you haven't seen a lot of opera based on what plot sounds good.

178
00:13:09,982 --> 00:13:12,472
Rym: Choose the opera based on the songs you like.

179
00:13:12,774 --> 00:13:14,160
Rym: that might be in that opera.

180
00:13:16,207 --> 00:13:21,318
Scott: Have the dumbest plots Yeah, so Carmen I kept listening and it was mostly just.

181
00:13:21,338 --> 00:13:23,044
Scott: you know Opera sounds right.

182
00:13:23,626 --> 00:13:26,534
Scott: and then another song comes and I'm like, oh, here's the second one.

183
00:13:26,554 --> 00:13:27,898
Scott: Do you know which one it was?

184
00:13:27,998 --> 00:13:37,592
Scott: No Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

185
00:13:38,153 --> 00:13:39,699
Scott: and then you know the big one right did it.

186
00:13:41,482 --> 00:13:42,774
Scott: That's also fucking Carmen.

187
00:13:42,834 --> 00:13:52,407
Rym: So if The Metropolitan Opera somehow survives which I imagine it will we were literally you and I planning to go on a double date to the Opera right after I was like.

188
00:13:52,607 --> 00:13:54,115
Scott: I was like I will go to an opera.

189
00:13:54,195 --> 00:13:55,260
Scott: It's been so many years.

190
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,486
Scott: Which one will I go to?

191
00:13:56,546 --> 00:13:58,756
Scott: Well Carmen moved itself up on the fucking list.

192
00:13:58,876 --> 00:13:59,620
Rym: I was hoping for.

193
00:14:00,762 --> 00:14:02,515
Rym: I've never seen Carmen so I'd be happy to go.

194
00:14:02,535 --> 00:14:09,520
Scott: so obviously And if the rich people prop up the opera enough, right, I feel like the opera ain't gonna go bankrupt.

195
00:14:10,381 --> 00:14:11,465
Scott: I don't think so either.

196
00:14:12,007 --> 00:14:14,838
Scott: If you have a Spotify or an Apple Music or whatever, go type in

197
00:14:14,898 --> 00:14:15,260
Scott: "Carmen.".

198
00:14:16,182 --> 00:14:19,832
Scott: I didn't even finish this, I didn't even get past the second path here.

199
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:22,600
Scott: There may be surprises that await here.

200
00:14:24,121 --> 00:14:28,700
Scott: Something else I learned is, you know who wrote "Carmen," the opera, composer, whatever?

201
00:14:30,043 --> 00:14:32,174
Rym: Uh, yeah, so what are you learning?

202
00:14:32,194 --> 00:14:33,239
Rym: I'm actually pulling up some Wikipedias.

203
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:34,663
Scott: Yeah, you are.

204
00:14:34,744 --> 00:14:36,720
Scott: It's Georges Bizet, right?

205
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:37,459
Rym: Yeah, Bizet.

206
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:38,821
Scott: Bizet.

207
00:14:39,343 --> 00:14:51,412
Scott: Apparently, the interesting thing that I read is that this person who made this ridiculously famous opera, uh, like, died after, like, the whatever performance of it.

208
00:14:52,294 --> 00:14:54,820
Scott: Um, and then it became famous afterwards.

209
00:14:56,761 --> 00:15:00,240
Rym: That seems like it's not uncommon just in media in general.

210
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,388
Scott: But, like, it didn't get performed that many times.

211
00:15:02,428 --> 00:15:03,572
Scott: Like, it wasn't a hit yet.

212
00:15:04,034 --> 00:15:05,700
Scott: And then they died, and then it became tremendous.

213
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,579
Rym: I mean, Rocky Horror Picture Show was not really a hit when it came out.

214
00:15:09,361 --> 00:15:11,080
Scott: It's still not a hit, really.

215
00:15:11,261 --> 00:15:12,300
Rym: It's a cult classic.

216
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:24,230
Scott: That's, yeah, I mean, it's basically people who care about movies have seen it, but in terms of, like, actual number of people who've actually seen it and know it, it's like people may know the name Rocky Horror Picture Show.

217
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,674
Scott: Yeah, I know that name.

218
00:15:25,694 --> 00:15:27,420
Scott: That's the way I knew Carmen yesterday.

219
00:15:28,401 --> 00:15:29,583
Scott: I know that's the name of an opera.

220
00:15:29,724 --> 00:15:32,471
Scott: I know that's the name of a thing, right?

221
00:15:33,293 --> 00:15:34,195
Scott: A movie or something.

222
00:15:34,215 --> 00:15:36,340
Scott: But they don't know it, know it, right?

223
00:15:36,942 --> 00:15:40,600
Scott: And they probably know the time warp and don't know what it's from or that it's even from a thing.

224
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,527
Rym: You know, because I was thinking about the William Tell Overture.

225
00:15:42,587 --> 00:15:45,239
Rym: Most people only know that from, like, TV shows it was in.

226
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,763
Rym: Or, like, the Tori Adar song.

227
00:15:47,324 --> 00:15:55,999
Rym: That song, most people, if you look it up on YouTube, almost all the comments are Five Nights at Freddy's kids being like, "Hey, it's the Five Nights at Freddy's

228
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:56,340
Rym: song!".

229
00:15:56,761 --> 00:16:02,079
Rym: And one old man is like, "No, it's the song that Martin Prince sings when he's in a cage in that episode of The

230
00:16:02,119 --> 00:16:02,460
Rym: Simpsons.".

231
00:16:07,101 --> 00:16:18,555
Rym: So, there's actually a lot of anime news, like, a ton of it, and most of it is around the fact that Netflix had an infinite number of announcements related to anime and animation recently.

232
00:16:18,575 --> 00:16:19,840
Rym: We're not even going to be able to cover all of these.

233
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:26,320
Scott: Netflix just did all kinds of anime biz, and they did all the press releases for all their anime biz all at once in a big blomp.

234
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:27,899
Scott: So, the biggest one.

235
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,072
Scott: "Oh, you want some anime Netflix news?

236
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:29,376
Scott: Here you

237
00:16:29,396 --> 00:16:29,558
Scott: go!".

238
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:37,920
Rym: And this is already during, like, this platinum age of animation where I'm watching, like, there is so much good animation out there, and a ton of it is on Netflix.

239
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:38,984
Rym: I'm just watching it there.

240
00:16:39,485 --> 00:16:48,440
Rym: But the one you all probably care the most about, the one that's getting the most buzz, at least in my circles, is, uh, there's a manga, The Way of the House Husband.

241
00:16:49,321 --> 00:16:53,651
Scott: Yeah, so, I, when I first saw this news, I was slightly confused.

242
00:16:53,711 --> 00:16:55,917
Scott: I'm like, "Have we judged this poorly?

243
00:16:55,937 --> 00:16:56,759
Scott: Why are people

244
00:16:56,819 --> 00:16:57,220
Scott: excited?".

245
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:01,268
Scott: Because the one that we judged, obviously, was not this one, right?

246
00:17:01,308 --> 00:17:07,020
Scott: We judged an anime, because, obviously, this is not an anime yet, right?

247
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,003
Scott: So, it couldn't have been.

248
00:17:08,023 --> 00:17:09,933
Scott: I was like, that's why I was confused, right?

249
00:17:09,953 --> 00:17:11,579
Scott: I was like, "Because we're only judging anime.

250
00:17:11,942 --> 00:17:13,872
Scott: There's no way I could judge an anime that exists.

251
00:17:13,912 --> 00:17:14,756
Scott: Are they remaking it?

252
00:17:14,776 --> 00:17:15,117
Scott: I don't know,

253
00:17:15,137 --> 00:17:15,239
Scott: right?".

254
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:26,579
Scott: But the one we judged is the questionable, not good one, where the Yakuza boss forces some Yakuza to get, uh, sex change operations and become idols.

255
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,339
Rym: Yeah, that's not the- that is not the-.

256
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,342
Scott: That is not this.

257
00:17:30,763 --> 00:17:43,379
Scott: This is the one where you see people posting online on Twitter, right, the JPEG of the single page of the manga, where there are two Yakuza complimenting each other's dogs and then wanting to pet them.

258
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,930
Rym: Like, "Alright, your dog is so cute.

259
00:17:47,336 --> 00:17:47,979
Rym: Can I pet

260
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:48,120
Rym: him?".

261
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,703
Scott: Yeah, that's this one.

262
00:17:50,764 --> 00:17:57,580
Scott: This is gonna be way good, uh, and it definitely, like, an anime adaptation of that, how can that be bad?

263
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,244
Rym: Yeah, I feel like it's gonna be really fun.

264
00:18:00,385 --> 00:18:14,140
Rym: I like it- anytime that trope of, like, a monster or something dangerous ends up in a very, like, simple domestic normal role, is just- that's almost- that's a trope that I just really like, and this seems like it's going to be a good show.

265
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,980
Rym: Netflix rarely seems to pick up stuff that's not good in this regard.

266
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,269
Scott: And they also do a good job of it, right?

267
00:18:22,152 --> 00:18:31,220
Rym: They're not gonna do, like, a, you know- Yeah, it won't be- it won't be the, uh, those 90s OAVs, like the Sanctuary OAV that we will never speak of again and never watch again.

268
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,161
Scott: Yeah.

269
00:18:33,224 --> 00:18:37,996
Scott: So, also, they announced the, you know, last- what, was it the last Wednesday episode?

270
00:18:38,036 --> 00:18:39,400
Scott: We talked about Olympic whatever?

271
00:18:39,641 --> 00:18:41,099
Rym: Oh, yeah, Olympic, uh, Kiklos.

272
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:51,380
Scott: Right, well, the- and we mentioned how the person who made the original manga of that was more famous for making, uh, Thermae Romae, however you pronounce it, I don't know.

273
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:52,419
Rym: Thermae Romae works.

274
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:52,921
Rym: And guess what?

275
00:18:53,162 --> 00:18:55,709
Scott: Netflix is making the anime of Thermae Romae.

276
00:18:55,729 --> 00:18:58,858
Scott: It's like, "Well, I guess I'll watch that instead of reading the manga.

277
00:18:58,898 --> 00:18:59,179
Scott: Thanks a

278
00:18:59,239 --> 00:18:59,399
Scott: lot.".

279
00:18:59,801 --> 00:19:01,918
Rym: Yep, especially considering how good Kiklos is.

280
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,490
Scott: Yeah, I mean, this will probably be a huge, you know, probably even better, right?

281
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:08,400
Scott: 'Cause the Kiklos one is obviously a low-budget situation.

282
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:17,476
Scott: Yeah, but the low-budget, I think, is enhancing how good it is for reasons that- Yes, but I think Thermae Romae is a little- is a little less ridiculous, um, even though it bears some similarities.

283
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:23,930
Rym: So- So, trucking right along from that, there's a- kind of a bigger underpinning to these announcements.

284
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:35,290
Rym: This is from about a week ago, but, uh, part of what's going on is that Netflix actually announced direct partnerships with Nas, Science Saru, Mappa, and Studio Mir.

285
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,835
Rym: And this is on the heels of announcing their partnerships with Production

286
00:19:38,955 --> 00:19:39,596
Rym: I.G.,

287
00:19:40,117 --> 00:19:42,480
Rym: which includes Bone- oh, and Bones.

288
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:53,220
Rym: Uh, Netflix is kind of just taking over the Western anime market, and they're also making huge inroads into the actual anime production industry in Japan.

289
00:19:54,981 --> 00:19:59,747
Scott: Yeah, it's basically rather than the old model of "Japan makes anime,".

290
00:20:00,247 --> 00:20:10,520
Scott: and then the Western funimations, you know, whatever, all those companies that went out of business, the genieons, whatever, pioneers, going and licensing those shows for release.

291
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:40,000
Scott: Instead, we have, basically, the digital distributors, right, just sitting on the companies, being like, "Alright, we got a partnership now, uh, you know, maybe we'll have some input on what you're making, right, it'll go both ways, but, you know, you make it, and it's ours already, right, we're in it from the start, before you even made the show, we're not licensing it after you made it or anything, we're gonna make the show together, and you show it in Japan how you're gonna show it, and we're gonna show it on Netflix over

292
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:40,140
Scott: here.".

293
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:45,106
Scott: Right, maybe Japan Netflix, I don't know, with their TV in Japan, whatever, but,

294
00:20:46,507 --> 00:20:47,068
Rym: uh,

295
00:20:47,108 --> 00:20:56,300
Scott: there's no opportunity for a Crunchyroll to get in there, there's not gonna be, like, negotiations or bids for licenses, um, who knows if they'll even

296
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,140
Rym: be- I don't think this bodes well for Funimation or for Crunchyroll in the long run, to be honest.

297
00:21:00,701 --> 00:21:11,360
Scott: Yeah, I don't know how it bodes for, like, you know, um, will the licenses ever expire, 'cause is it even a license, right, they just have it forever, it's like, it's a Netflix show forever, the end, right?

298
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:20,620
Scott: Um, will anyone get to put out DVDs and boures if they want, you know, what's, is there a merch situation, right, is Netflix gonna come to the anime cons?

299
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,402
Rym: And it was interesting, I was thinking about.

300
00:21:22,442 --> 00:21:38,180
Rym: where am I watching, like, animation, not even just anime, but animation in general, and honestly, like, 70% of all the animation I'm watching lately, like, in the last six months, is on Netflix, and then, like, 10% Crunchyroll, 10% everything else combined.

301
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,305
Scott: Yep.

302
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:51,156
Rym: Meanwhile, the show, the one show, I want a Geek Bite right now, a show that is not on any of those pla- the show is actually, like, on Funimation's platform, I think.

303
00:21:52,318 --> 00:21:53,360
Rym: We ended up watching it.

304
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,120
Scott: You gotta, uh, uh, here's some problems over there.

305
00:21:56,241 --> 00:21:57,076
Rym: That little cough coming in.

306
00:21:57,921 --> 00:22:01,680
Scott: Uh-oh, you weren't standing next to some no mask maskless people in the voting line.

307
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:07,799
Rym: One, thankfully, living in New York, 100% of the people in that line were, like, mega masked up.

308
00:22:08,669 --> 00:22:08,979
Scott: Of course.

309
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:19,260
Rym: 'Cause they won't let you in, like, you know, you see those videos in other states where, like, there's people without masks all over, like, inside of- that really does not happen in New York City, except maybe in Staten Island.

310
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:26,019
Scott: I mean, I see people who might not wear the mask, like, when they're walking down the sidewalk alone or with someone.

311
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,160
Rym: But you see them, like, pull it up as soon as someone else appears on the street.

312
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:39,038
Scott: Right, but, like, if anyone is going into a place or with a person or whatever, right, or going to a building or any, you know, then no one is not wearing, you know.

313
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:45,700
Rym: But, uh, when we judged anime, one of the animes we judged was a show called Deca Dense.

314
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:55,699
Rym: And it looked like a generic fighting show, like, it might be fun, maybe it's, like, I don't know, Attack on Titan, but we basically- Didn't we talk about this a little bit last week, too?

315
00:22:55,943 --> 00:22:56,599
Rym: Yes, we did.

316
00:22:56,981 --> 00:23:02,140
Rym: So, I've actually seen some of it now, because basically what happened was, I was gonna ignore that show unless there was some buzz.

317
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,999
Rym: There was some buzz, there was a lot of buzz.

318
00:23:04,824 --> 00:23:06,140
Scott: I heard the buzz as well, buzz buzz.

319
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,059
Rym: Literally, yeah, I'm a busy little bee.

320
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,220
Rym: Literally everyone who said anything about this show said the same thing.

321
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,137
Rym: It's not what it looks like, just watch it.

322
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,279
Rym: Two episodes in, you'll see why.

323
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,980
Rym: And no one would- no one would spoil anything else about it.

324
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:25,420
Rym: So I went, and we- turns out we accidentally have a Hulu account.

325
00:23:26,062 --> 00:23:30,880
Rym: So we watched two episodes on Hulu, and sure enough, it starts out, it's good.

326
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:37,260
Rym: Without the twist, like, if there was nothing special about this show, it actually started out pretty good.

327
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,580
Rym: Like, it was a pretty solid anime, actually better than I expected.

328
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,920
Rym: But the very end of episode one, they show a weird scene, and then the episode ends.

329
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,740
Rym: And all I can think is, wait, that was a weird scene, explain that.

330
00:23:50,201 --> 00:23:54,154
Rym: Then I watched episode two, and by the end of episode two, what that scene is is explained.

331
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,920
Rym: And the show is not even close to what I thought it was about.

332
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,918
Rym: The show is- you gotta watch it.

333
00:24:04,983 --> 00:24:05,800
Rym: That's all I'm gonna say.

334
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,018
Rym: Decadence is a show that needs to be watched.

335
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:13,340
Scott: Maybe I gotta pirate it, I don't know, 'cause I don't have no Hulu, and I'm not gonna switch my Netflix for Hulu anytime soon.

336
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,800
Rym: Yep, you could- I don't know, we'll figure out a way for you to watch it.

337
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:20,360
Rym: I've only seen two episodes, but I am deeply intrigued.

338
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:26,569
Rym: Like, the best way I can describe this is, I'm watching that first episode, and I'm thinking, "Oh, wait, is this an Evangelion?

339
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,100
Rym: Or is this gonna be more like an Attack on Titan?

340
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,259
Rym: Like, which direction is this conflict gonna

341
00:24:31,299 --> 00:24:31,400
Rym: go?".

342
00:24:32,261 --> 00:24:34,280
Scott: I can just watch Evangelion, I can watch that anytime.

343
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,970
Rym: But then it went Mad Max?

344
00:24:36,694 --> 00:24:37,600
Rym: For a brief moment.

345
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,609
Rym: I was like, "Oh, Mad Max?

346
00:24:40,031 --> 00:24:41,900
Rym: That is an interesting play, let's see.

347
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,457
Rym: Like, that's an interesting strategy, let's see how it turns

348
00:24:44,638 --> 00:24:44,719
Rym: out.".

349
00:24:45,243 --> 00:24:47,319
Rym: And then, it goes off the deep end.

350
00:24:48,245 --> 00:24:48,540
Scott: Alright.

351
00:24:49,482 --> 00:24:53,320
Rym: I think it is particularly, specifically, up your alley, personally.

352
00:24:54,362 --> 00:24:55,080
Scott: Okay, maybe.

353
00:24:55,140 --> 00:25:02,840
Rym: Based on what that scene looks like, the style that scene is in, this show is a Scott show, in particular.

354
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,219
Scott: Okay, well, we'll see.

355
00:25:06,164 --> 00:25:10,000
Scott: So, uh, yeah, I have this laundry list- Maybe I should wait till it's 100% out, though, before I start watching it.

356
00:25:10,101 --> 00:25:12,839
Rym: I think it is already out, I think, uh, people have seen it to the end.

357
00:25:13,528 --> 00:25:13,812
Scott: The whole show?

358
00:25:13,832 --> 00:25:14,380
Scott: Oh, okay, alright.

359
00:25:15,101 --> 00:25:18,680
Rym: So, beyond that, other Netflix stuff, like, we're just gonna breeze over these.

360
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:22,220
Rym: There's a Gorillaz animated movie coming on Netflix.

361
00:25:22,741 --> 00:25:27,519
Rym: There's the Pacific Rym anime that Netflix, I believe, is funding straight up.

362
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:37,440
Rym: There is Blue-Eyed Samurai, which is an animated action series with a bunch of famous people I don't really know, and a bunch of famous people I do know are all involved in it.

363
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,579
Rym: This is, like, the all-star cast animated show.

364
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,416
Rym: George Takei is even in it.

365
00:25:43,244 --> 00:25:43,394
Scott: Okay.

366
00:25:43,883 --> 00:25:46,100
Scott: We got, uh, this is old news.

367
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,140
Scott: Is that not Netflix?

368
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,560
Rym: An old news from, like, well, old.

369
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:57,440
Rym: From earlier in October, I don't think we talked about it much, but Bee and Puppycat, season two, where the show kind of goes for real, is on Netflix.

370
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,340
Scott: Yep, we didn't talk about that, but that did happen, yep.

371
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,260
Rym: Yeah, I feel like we talked about it, but we didn't talk about it on the show.

372
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,280
Scott: That's, I think that's correct, yes.

373
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:05,427
Rym: Yep.

374
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:10,360
Rym: And, uh, last, we actually have some non-anime follow-up with the manga.

375
00:26:10,783 --> 00:26:17,740
Rym: Remember a while back, we talked about the, uh, Utena manga that takes place after the revolution?

376
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,039
Rym: Spoilers, the revolution happens at the end of Utena.

377
00:26:21,283 --> 00:26:32,040
Scott: Yeah, so, all right, so that, we talked about that, but yeah, Chiyo Saito made another volume of Utena manga called Utena After the Revolution, which I presume takes place after the revolution.

378
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,819
Rym: I imagine it's just, uh, it's Saved by the Bell, the college years.

379
00:26:35,301 --> 00:26:36,760
Scott: Yeah, it actually came out.

380
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:42,759
Scott: It came out, like, earlier this month, but I didn't notice because I didn't receive my copy of it until, like, a couple days ago.

381
00:26:43,341 --> 00:26:48,120
Scott: But it is now in my hands, an English copy, a legitimate English copy of this manga.

382
00:26:48,241 --> 00:26:52,200
Scott: So if you're an Utena fan, I don't know if it's good or bad, I can't say.

383
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,018
Rym: But you know what it is?

384
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:57,320
Rym: It is more canonical content for your moribund franchise.

385
00:26:58,341 --> 00:27:01,620
Scott: Yeah, so, uh, I'm gonna read it soon just to see what the deal is.

386
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:06,160
Scott: You'll probably hear from me in two weeks about what it contains, some geek bite or something, or who knows.

387
00:27:06,782 --> 00:27:11,480
Scott: But yeah, it's now available, so if you want to read it, you should do that soon.

388
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:22,300
Rym: My caution to you, if you liked the Utena anime but have never read the manga, you absolutely have to read the rest of the manga first, because the manga is very different from the anime.

389
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,498
Scott: Yeah, I've only read some of the original Utena manga.

390
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,819
Rym: Like, Black Rose is not really canonically part of the manga, it's like a side story that's tacked on at the end.

391
00:27:32,581 --> 00:27:38,000
Scott: Yeah, I don't know how much this new manga has to do with the old manga, though, versus it has to do with the anime.

392
00:27:38,581 --> 00:27:39,320
Rym: We're gonna find out.

393
00:27:39,441 --> 00:27:44,100
Rym: I believe it just picks right up from the old manga, assuming Black Rose didn't actually happen.

394
00:27:44,803 --> 00:27:45,980
Scott: I'll have to do some research.

395
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,880
Rym: Yeah, I'm just gonna read it, because I've read the manga, it doesn't matter.

396
00:27:49,582 --> 00:27:54,720
Scott: Yeah, maybe I'll re-read the complete old manga first, and then... Because it's not that long, it's only a few volumes, right?

397
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,419
Scott: The original manga?

398
00:27:55,802 --> 00:27:57,100
Rym: Oh yeah, it's not long at all, I have it.

399
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,000
Rym: I could just drop it off at your house if you want to read it.

400
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,493
Scott: It's not like a big 20+ volume deal.

401
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:08,840
Rym: The other thing I'll caution you is, if you really liked Utena, but you wanted, like, more lore, or answers to burning questions, the manga does not provide that.

402
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,599
Scott: The manga does not have that.

403
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:16,980
Rym: The manga is Chiyo Saito telling the Chiyo Saito story, which is not the story that the anime tells.

404
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:21,940
Rym: The anime goes in a very different direction for all the eco-horror reasons we have discussed in the past.

405
00:28:26,202 --> 00:28:29,280
Rym: But anyway, things of the day!

406
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:29,997
Rym: What do you got?

407
00:28:30,781 --> 00:28:34,620
Scott: Got a very tiny thing of the day here, but it is very high quality, right?

408
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,059
Scott: So what it is is real simple.

409
00:28:36,822 --> 00:28:40,980
Scott: It is a TV commercial, and this TV commercial is, what, 15 seconds long?

410
00:28:41,021 --> 00:28:41,560
Scott: It's real short.

411
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:45,840
Scott: And they are advertising a brand of sausage that you can eat.

412
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:49,280
Scott: Basically, I think it's like Slim Jim that comes in a tube, right?

413
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,719
Scott: But some other Japanese brand.

414
00:28:51,301 --> 00:28:54,620
Scott: But the commercial is a Fist of the North Star commercial.

415
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,120
Scott: It is therefore amazing.

416
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,893
Scott: Kenshiro says, "Eat some

417
00:28:58,933 --> 00:28:59,417
Scott: sausage-y.".

418
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,080
Scott: I don't know.

419
00:29:02,482 --> 00:29:04,660
Scott: It's not actually translated, but I'm going to pretend.

420
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,616
Scott: It says, "You have already eaten

421
00:29:06,677 --> 00:29:07,040
Scott: sausage.".

422
00:29:07,122 --> 00:29:07,819
Rym: I only watched it once.

423
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:12,180
Rym: I'm not going to play it again while I'm doing the show, but it sounded like he said something different.

424
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:12,709
Rym: He said like, "Oh

425
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:12,933
Rym: my.".

426
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:15,460
Rym: But he said something slightly different there.

427
00:29:15,761 --> 00:29:18,036
Rym: I couldn't tell if that was just-- I think it might have been, "You have already eaten

428
00:29:18,076 --> 00:29:18,319
Rym: sausage.".

429
00:29:18,601 --> 00:29:23,079
Rym: Yeah, I could not tell, and I don't want to play it again, because we're literally live streaming the show.

430
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,960
Rym: But I will listen to it again after.

431
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:28,239
Scott: The point is, for 15 seconds, you can watch this.

432
00:29:29,346 --> 00:29:33,960
Rym: What I wonder is, if I bite into one of these sausages, will they explode in a pile of gore and blood?

433
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:35,820
Scott: Your enemy will expire.

434
00:29:35,981 --> 00:29:37,340
Rym: The first-- this is a Twitter post.

435
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,320
Rym: It's Patrick Macias.

436
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:45,620
Rym: The first reply to his tweet is, quote, "How much blood is there in those sausages, and under how many megapascals of pressure?

437
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,516
Rym: Biting into these has to be very

438
00:29:47,597 --> 00:29:47,880
Rym: risky.".

439
00:29:49,342 --> 00:29:51,739
Scott: I'm pretty sure your opponent will explode when you bite one.

440
00:29:53,603 --> 00:29:55,820
Scott: You wouldn't sell very many if the customers exploded.

441
00:29:57,546 --> 00:29:59,180
Scott: Or maybe you offer one to your opponent.

442
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:03,880
Scott: Like, you know, that's like a peace offering, but then they explode.

443
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:11,980
Rym: So my thing of the day from late September, an infinite time in the past, is an official special music video.

444
00:30:12,301 --> 00:30:14,000
Rym: This happened every now and then over the years.

445
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,420
Rym: Like, there is an official Escaflowne one at one point.

446
00:30:16,762 --> 00:30:18,840
Rym: This is an official Pokemon music video.

447
00:30:19,241 --> 00:30:25,520
Rym: So it feels like an AMV, but it is actually official, animated by Bones, to a song.

448
00:30:26,461 --> 00:30:28,000
Rym: Gotcha, Bump of Chicken.

449
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,180
Rym: Don't worry too much about the lyrics.

450
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:30,373
Rym: What?

451
00:30:31,483 --> 00:30:34,360
Rym: Do not worry too much about why this is called Bump of Chicken.

452
00:30:35,984 --> 00:30:37,320
Rym: I imagine it's like a bump of cocaine.

453
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,659
Scott: Camels have bumps, not chickens.

454
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,780
Rym: But a Bump of Chicken.

455
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,940
Rym: But this is a phenomenal music video.

456
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,780
Rym: The animation is fantastic.

457
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:50,859
Rym: This will give you such just, like, a gut punch of nostalgia for the entire Pokemon franchise.

458
00:30:51,721 --> 00:31:04,699
Rym: To the level of, if you didn't know, the movie Stand By Me, a classic of, like, Americana growing up movies, probably more important and more noteworthy than the Goonies for a lot of reasons in America.

459
00:31:06,062 --> 00:31:10,679
Rym: The movie Stand By Me is canonically in Pokemon Red, the original Pokemon.

460
00:31:12,148 --> 00:31:12,499
Scott: That's true.

461
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:13,899
Rym: That is, in fact, true.

462
00:31:14,461 --> 00:31:16,540
Rym: And there is a scene in the very beginning.

463
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:22,740
Rym: This music video starts with four boys walking on some train tracks about to go find some Pokemon.

464
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,212
Scott: Oh, no.

465
00:31:24,901 --> 00:31:26,120
Rym: This music video is great.

466
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,540
Rym: Judas showed it to us the other night.

467
00:31:27,741 --> 00:31:28,675
Rym: She was like, "Hey, you got to watch

468
00:31:28,716 --> 00:31:28,858
Rym: this.".

469
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,556
Rym: And, yeah, you all got to watch it.

470
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:32,698
Rym: In the moment?

471
00:31:33,282 --> 00:31:33,740
Rym: I don't know.

472
00:31:34,081 --> 00:31:35,200
Rym: Stuck inside, still.

473
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,934
Rym: Nothing's changed in the last 48 hours.

474
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,297
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

475
00:31:41,041 --> 00:31:42,540
Rym: Uh, the book club book is still tailored.

476
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,320
Rym: Opera Club.

477
00:31:45,385 --> 00:31:46,360
Scott: There have to be operas.

478
00:31:46,461 --> 00:31:50,500
Scott: And the problem with the Opera Club is that operas are not necessarily accessible to everyone.

479
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,060
Scott: There are recordings of operas.

480
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:58,040
Rym: Like, I watch God or Dameron in person, but I watch the rest of the Ring Cycle on, uh, uh, basically on tape.

481
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:58,957
Scott: Yeah, you can watch them on video.

482
00:31:59,321 --> 00:32:00,280
Scott: But, like, that's the other thing.

483
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:03,200
Scott: It's like, we're not qualified or knowledgeable to, like, comment on them.

484
00:32:03,362 --> 00:32:04,640
Rym: No, that would be naive commentary.

485
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:07,600
Rym: We would just review the opera as an entertainment experience.

486
00:32:09,122 --> 00:32:13,119
Scott: It had these three songs, I remember, and I don't, and because they're the famous songs, I don't remember the rest.

487
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,720
Scott: I didn't understand what anyone was saying.

488
00:32:14,801 --> 00:32:16,620
Scott: I read the subtitles and the story was stupid.

489
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,160
Scott: That's gonna be the comment for every single opera.

490
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:20,120
Rym: Faust, why did you make that terrible deal with the devil?

491
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,459
Rym: What did you think was gonna happen?

492
00:32:22,102 --> 00:32:22,899
Scott: The book was better.

493
00:32:27,342 --> 00:32:30,300
Scott: But, yeah, the, uh, the book club book is still The Tale of Genji.

494
00:32:30,661 --> 00:32:34,760
Scott: I almost read it, but then I read these comic books we're about to talk about instead.

495
00:32:35,442 --> 00:32:38,900
Rym: Yep, uh, I was, uh, not thinking about reading it because I don't have time to read anything.

496
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,960
Rym: Do you know how much shit I gotta do in my day-to-day life?

497
00:32:41,041 --> 00:32:42,140
Scott: You read these comic books.

498
00:32:42,481 --> 00:32:45,198
Rym: Yeah, I read these comic books, like, I only read the first volume.

499
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,339
Rym: I didn't get a time to read the second volume yet.

500
00:32:47,982 --> 00:32:49,819
Scott: All right, well, there's only two volumes that I'm aware of.

501
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,560
Rym: Yeah, which is fine because the first volume is great.

502
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,659
Rym: I got enough to go on with this.

503
00:32:53,101 --> 00:32:56,020
Scott: Is there any other meta moment whatsoever?

504
00:32:56,762 --> 00:32:57,520
Rym: Uh, nothing really.

505
00:32:57,641 --> 00:32:58,819
Rym: Just follow us in all the places.

506
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,760
Rym: Bug us if you don't have a link to our Discord.

507
00:33:01,621 --> 00:33:06,419
Rym: You can also use our GeekNights community forum, but kids mostly hang out in Discords these days.

508
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,820
Scott: Yep, anyway, uh, that's the end of the meta moment.

509
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,498
Scott: Give me a meta moment to go get the comics off the shelf because I forgot to bring them to my desk.

510
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:16,379
Rym: All right, so, Isola.

511
00:33:17,541 --> 00:33:20,689
Rym: I haven't been following comics much lately because I've been doing a lot of other things.

512
00:33:21,964 --> 00:33:30,200
Rym: Like, most of what's occupying my brain time that is not, like, projects I'm working on are video games and board games and some technology things lately.

513
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,379
Rym: So I've been reading comics.

514
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,760
Rym: Didn't even know this was coming.

515
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,260
Rym: But, uh, Isola, uh, has- Isola?

516
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,279
Scott: I don't know how to pronounce it.

517
00:33:37,443 --> 00:33:37,839
Scott: I-sola?

518
00:33:38,404 --> 00:33:38,759
Scott: I-sola?

519
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,140
Rym: I'm going with Isola unless someone tells me otherwise.

520
00:33:42,561 --> 00:33:48,078
Rym: An evil spell has been cast on the Queen of Marr and her Captain of the Guard will do anything to reverse it.

521
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:55,320
Rym: The only hope lies in an island half a world away, a place known in myth as Isola, the Land of the Dead.

522
00:33:55,680 --> 00:34:02,640
Rym: Gotham Academy creators Brendan Fletcher and Carl Kerschel reunite with a colorist and a letterer to make this thing come alive.

523
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:12,217
Rym: The funniest thing is the Amazon listing has a sentence at the end that just says, "recommended for fans of Studio Ghibli and the works of Hayao

524
00:34:12,237 --> 00:34:12,679
Rym: Miyazaki.".

525
00:34:14,206 --> 00:34:14,498
Scott: Kinda.

526
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,197
Rym: Yeah, kinda.

527
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:16,760
Rym: Not a hundred percent.

528
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:20,500
Rym: Like, that is an oddly specific recommendation to make.

529
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:30,300
Rym: I guess I see- I see where they're going with that, but it's really- If you're a fan of the Naoshika manga, that's a better, like-.

530
00:34:30,521 --> 00:34:33,080
Scott: Naoshika is definitely the closest to this.

531
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:37,980
Rym: Because if someone watched Totoro and then thinks they're going to read this, not the best fit, maybe.

532
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,597
Scott: No, not at all.

533
00:34:40,683 --> 00:34:42,020
Scott: So what's the deal here?

534
00:34:42,482 --> 00:34:44,820
Scott: So the creators of this are pretty interesting.

535
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,100
Scott: I'd never heard of them before.

536
00:34:46,701 --> 00:34:53,380
Scott: And I looked them up, and you look at their credits, and their credits don't have any particular item, right?

537
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,480
Scott: That is like, you know, wow, that's like an all-time great kind of thing, right?

538
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,920
Rym: Well, I recognized Carl Kerschel when I looked up his Wikipedia because I've seen him before at conventions.

539
00:35:04,565 --> 00:35:05,000
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

540
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,720
Scott: I mean, I know the person's- I know their name.

541
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,831
Rym: But I knew him as a DC guy, like.

542
00:35:08,851 --> 00:35:10,499
Rym: I didn't really think beyond that.

543
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,288
Scott: Right, it's like name for me.

544
00:35:12,469 --> 00:35:13,920
Scott: one thing he did, right?

545
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:18,240
Rym: It's like, you know- Some DC stuff, but he won an Eisner in 2011.

546
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:18,331
Scott: Sure.

547
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:29,219
Scott: But it's all this, you know, these are people who are like seasoned professionals in the industry, but they don't have to their name, right?

548
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:34,060
Scott: Like that, you know, huge title that like everyone knows, right?

549
00:35:34,442 --> 00:35:37,899
Scott: Even people who do work in superhero stuff, right?

550
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,740
Scott: You know, like a Frank Miller has like a Dark Knight Returns.

551
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,779
Scott: Like, oh, he's got a, you know, that's his thing, right?

552
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:50,220
Rym: A comic person might know like, oh yeah, Gotham Academy or like Teen Titans Year One, but that doesn't break beyond the comic fan people.

553
00:35:51,240 --> 00:36:01,940
Scott: Right, but like, you know, like they have these creators still have tremendous talent, you know, tremendous skills, and they're just doing professional work for hire, right?

554
00:36:02,442 --> 00:36:06,000
Scott: So here they come with their own story, right?

555
00:36:06,381 --> 00:36:09,500
Scott: A new, a brand new property, a unique thing, right?

556
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:14,960
Scott: You know, published by Image and it's like, whoa, look at that, right?

557
00:36:15,322 --> 00:36:15,899
Scott: Holy snap.

558
00:36:17,863 --> 00:36:20,320
Scott: So what the heck is Isola about, right?

559
00:36:20,641 --> 00:36:30,340
Scott: This thing that, you know, these very talented, you know, comic industry professionals did when they finally would make their own book instead of, you know, just another superhero book, right?

560
00:36:30,641 --> 00:36:51,554
Scott: So the story here is like what Rym said, there is some kingdom, you don't know a queendom, you don't know about a country, a nation, and the queen of that nation, and this is not a spoiler because it's revealed on page like fucking one, has been intentionally, unintentionally, somehow transformed into a tiger, roar, roar, right?

561
00:36:54,781 --> 00:37:02,620
Scott: And the queen's guard, the number one guard of the queens, basically like the equivalent of Oscar from Rose of Versailles, same job, right?

562
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:09,719
Scott: Royal guard, the only one person, the chief Royal guard person, uh, is accompanying the tiger on a journey.

563
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:18,319
Scott: So they're running away, um, and trying to keep the queen alive, which is sometimes easy because the queen is a tiger.

564
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,720
Rym: Sometimes difficult because the world is terrifyingly dangerous.

565
00:37:22,361 --> 00:37:24,820
Scott: And because the queen is a tiger and they're like hunters.

566
00:37:25,303 --> 00:37:27,400
Scott: And some people seem to know the queen is a tiger.

567
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,680
Scott: Some people don't, right?

568
00:37:29,102 --> 00:37:31,634
Rym: Like one random person who shows up, it's like, oh, I know, I know.

569
00:37:35,102 --> 00:37:37,500
Scott: It's also a fantasy world full of magic.

570
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:49,000
Scott: Um, and also there seems to be this terrible secret of space, um, that is revealed very, very early on and that there are, what do they call them?

571
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,017
Scott: There's like a name for them.

572
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,789
Rym: Well, there's the, there's the idea of like.

573
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:53,660
Rym: who is going to be the in between.

574
00:37:55,269 --> 00:37:55,480
Scott: Sure.

575
00:37:55,601 --> 00:37:58,600
Scott: But no, there's these things called the Hallam, which are these birds.

576
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,020
Scott: They look like Ravens or crows, black birds of some kind, gigantic black birds.

577
00:38:03,686 --> 00:38:04,860
Scott: They are enormous.

578
00:38:05,121 --> 00:38:09,960
Scott: We're talking like, you know, bigger than dinosaur sized, right?

579
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,860
Scott: Like could probably Peck it like an Eva's face.

580
00:38:16,443 --> 00:38:23,499
Scott: Um, uh, so they're out there and they early on, they encounter one that is already deceased somehow.

581
00:38:24,301 --> 00:38:27,620
Rym: And it's notable that the characters are like, I didn't know they could die.

582
00:38:28,463 --> 00:38:28,580
Scott: Right.

583
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,459
Scott: It's like, holy shit.

584
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:36,580
Scott: And so it's like they're there as like, even after, you know, volume two, right?

585
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:48,680
Scott: It's like, they're sort of like this looming, not present, but like, you just know they exist in this world threat that sort of hovers over everything because they're mentioned often.

586
00:38:48,787 --> 00:38:49,000
Scott: Right.

587
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:51,440
Scott: They're always like Hallam this and Hallam that.

588
00:38:51,586 --> 00:38:51,840
Scott: Right.

589
00:38:52,601 --> 00:39:00,059
Scott: Um, you know, even though they're not there, we haven't that direct conflict of giant birds are coming to Peck you right now.

590
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:00,999
Scott: That hasn't happened.

591
00:39:01,612 --> 00:39:01,840
Scott: Right.

592
00:39:02,001 --> 00:39:03,759
Scott: That would sort of make things end quickly.

593
00:39:04,412 --> 00:39:04,598
Rym: Yep.

594
00:39:04,981 --> 00:39:11,720
Rym: But what is happening, like what I like about this comic is it starts in media res and uses proper nouns appropriately.

595
00:39:11,881 --> 00:39:14,040
Rym: And you start to figure out the deal.

596
00:39:14,201 --> 00:39:17,000
Rym: There's like an empire that appears to be collapsing.

597
00:39:17,582 --> 00:39:25,960
Rym: Like you encounter, like the, the equivalent of the Roman legions of this emperor empire are sort of like in disarray, like things are starting to fall down.

598
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,540
Rym: There's ruins, there's other kingdoms out there.

599
00:39:28,863 --> 00:39:30,180
Rym: There's these warrior clans.

600
00:39:30,721 --> 00:39:43,219
Rym: And I do appreciate media that has a lot of those kinds of proper nouns, but just trust you to figure it out and like reveal the story organically instead of having like an origin story or a prelude to explain it all.

601
00:39:43,984 --> 00:39:46,120
Scott: Well, it's not necessarily proper noun leading, right?

602
00:39:46,201 --> 00:39:46,362
Scott: Like.

603
00:39:46,402 --> 00:39:48,560
Scott: sometimes it's just like, yeah, they're hunters, right?

604
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,540
Scott: It's like, it's just an appropriate word to describe the group.

605
00:39:51,680 --> 00:40:00,820
Scott: And the only proper nouns are the ones that for things that need proper nouns, names of countries, names of things that don't exist in the real world, right?

606
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,218
Scott: Names of people, right?

607
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:02,589
Scott: Yep.

608
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,880
Rym: They're not like- There are a lot of incidental ones.

609
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:09,878
Rym: Like they bring up circles, like the circle a lot, and you sort of figure out what that really means as it goes on.

610
00:40:10,281 --> 00:40:11,918
Rym: Like why, where this character came from.

611
00:40:13,561 --> 00:40:20,819
Scott: But yeah, it's, it's pretty much, you know, journey of two people together and the thing, the difficulties they encounter along the way.

612
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,996
Scott: And they're your discovery and their discovery, right?

613
00:40:27,301 --> 00:40:31,640
Scott: Of, um, you know, like what the true, what the real deal is, right?

614
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:35,439
Scott: Cause like, you know, the queen clearly knows more than the guard does.

615
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:44,220
Rym: The queen is, and there's also a, the guard knows a lot, but the guard's origin is sort of mysterious, like how the guard came into this position.

616
00:40:44,763 --> 00:40:46,819
Rym: There's some romance angles, there's a lot going on.

617
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:53,819
Scott: And they encounter lots of, you know, interesting figures, like magical old man type of people that know more or less, right?

618
00:40:54,703 --> 00:40:57,519
Scott: And help or hinder their journey along the way.

619
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:00,580
Scott: There's also the big mystery, right?

620
00:41:01,101 --> 00:41:05,020
Scott: Is this place they're going to, Isola, Isola, whatever, right?

621
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:12,535
Scott: Is at some times you think Isola is actually just like, you know, heaven is not a real place, right?

622
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,560
Scott: You know, they're going to their, or it's like the land of the dead.

623
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:18,260
Scott: They're just going out to die somewhere appropriately.

624
00:41:18,721 --> 00:41:22,600
Scott: Or, you know, they're, the journey that they're taking is the important part.

625
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:26,980
Scott: There isn't at the destination is not real, or it's a magical other land.

626
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:31,639
Scott: It's not a real land land, or maybe it is a real land land, you know?

627
00:41:32,802 --> 00:41:36,980
Scott: And anytime people they meet along the way talk about it, they always talk ambiguously.

628
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,900
Rym: - But I think the main reason to read this, like the plot is good.

629
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:42,718
Rym: The characters are good.

630
00:41:43,081 --> 00:41:47,520
Rym: Like the dialogue is all right, but it really focuses on visual storytelling.

631
00:41:48,142 --> 00:41:54,720
Rym: And the words the characters are saying are driving like the things that you can't drive visually because it's a fairly complex world.

632
00:41:55,240 --> 00:42:00,080
Rym: The visual storytelling is pretty phenomenal and the creatures are beautiful.

633
00:42:00,642 --> 00:42:02,960
Rym: Like the pages are just beautiful reading this comic.

634
00:42:04,241 --> 00:42:11,080
Scott: - Yeah, what'll happen often is, you know, there's the parts of the story that are quite, you know, literal, like this is happening, right?

635
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:19,399
Scott: And then people are often, characters are often in dreams or hallucinations or visions of some kind.

636
00:42:19,982 --> 00:42:21,531
Scott: And you can get a little confusing.

637
00:42:21,652 --> 00:42:23,120
Scott: actually, you know, is this real?

638
00:42:23,241 --> 00:42:24,039
Scott: Is this not real?

639
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,420
Rym: - It's almost like form is function.

640
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:34,139
Rym: Like you, you, the reader are disoriented by these rapid shifts of context, but the character that you're following is equally disoriented by them.

641
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:45,480
Scott: - And also the things that are happening, it's like, you know, after the first, like, you know, dreams, you know, kind of, you know, dreamish sequence, right?

642
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:56,531
Scott: You sort of realize, you know, it doesn't matter if this part is literally happening or is in someone's mind or is a vision or who knows what it is because all of it's real, right?

643
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:59,960
Scott: It's not, they're not, they're not illusions of lies, right?

644
00:43:00,802 --> 00:43:03,040
Scott: They're visions of true things, right?

645
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,040
Scott: It's like, oh, the dream is showing me something.

646
00:43:05,101 --> 00:43:06,379
Scott: They're learning things, right?

647
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:10,720
Scott: They're not, you know, being fooled by anyone except when they are, right?

648
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:18,980
Scott: And then you find this, in that case, there is somebody, there's, you know, there's a visible adversary who is doing the fooling.

649
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:22,040
Scott: So it's not, that part is not, you know, confusing.

650
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:26,480
Rym: - But what's interesting too is that it actually moves pretty quick.

651
00:43:26,741 --> 00:43:36,180
Rym: Like, I gave up trying to predict the pace of this almost immediately because things that I thought they were, like, felt like in a comic would be a setup for later got resolved immediately.

652
00:43:36,641 --> 00:43:39,260
Rym: Other things lasted way longer than I expected.

653
00:43:39,861 --> 00:43:47,219
Rym: And even volume one ends in a, it ends in a very different place from what I expected one trade of a comic like this to end at.

654
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:48,583
Scott: - Yeah, I think what.

655
00:43:48,844 --> 00:43:53,559
Scott: the reason is that, you know, it originally came out as, you know, individual issues, right?

656
00:43:54,022 --> 00:43:57,280
Scott: So each of those issues actually has to have, like, stuff happen in it.

657
00:43:58,782 --> 00:44:03,800
Scott: And all the, normally on a long journey like this, you'd have a lot of that, you know, time spent traveling.

658
00:44:04,165 --> 00:44:05,099
Scott: They don't do any of that.

659
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:11,139
Scott: They only giving you the destined, you know, they've arrived somewhere and do a thing at the place.

660
00:44:11,301 --> 00:44:13,600
Scott: They meet some people and do a thing at the place.

661
00:44:14,101 --> 00:44:20,240
Scott: You know, the parts where things happen are the only parts, the way you're supposed to play, like, a tabletop RPG properly, right?

662
00:44:20,661 --> 00:44:33,715
Scott: And it's just like, you know, when they're in a place and then as they resolve whatever is happening there and, like, the next page, which would be, I guess, the next issue, I don't know where the issue boundaries are because the trade puts all the covers at the end of the book.

663
00:44:35,502 --> 00:44:38,780
Scott: But it's like they're immediately at a new place, basically, right?

664
00:44:39,121 --> 00:44:47,420
Scott: There's not a lot of time spent, maybe a page or two of, like, we're walking on some cliff rocks and then we see a new place, right?

665
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,678
Scott: And let's go there.

666
00:44:49,427 --> 00:44:50,440
Rym: But there's definitely a house.

667
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:51,177
Scott: Let's go in it.

668
00:44:51,460 --> 00:45:01,516
Rym: There's definitely the theme of, like, there was an empire that for various reasons is collapsing and there's some sort of ecological catastrophe that may or may not be related to that.

669
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,099
Rym: And there's a very deep transhuman theme the entire way so far.

670
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:09,420
Scott: You know, it'll be like, oh, we're escaping some hunters.

671
00:45:09,584 --> 00:45:10,098
Scott: We escaped.

672
00:45:10,502 --> 00:45:11,100
Scott: There's some ruins.

673
00:45:11,202 --> 00:45:12,380
Scott: Let's go in the ruins, right?

674
00:45:12,461 --> 00:45:13,198
Scott: Like the next page.

675
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:16,960
Rym: Oh, there's the head of, like, the legion that was stationed there.

676
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:20,220
Rym: But, like, the empire doesn't appear to be paying them anymore.

677
00:45:20,522 --> 00:45:22,919
Rym: And, like, it's not really clear what's going on.

678
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:23,960
Scott: Yep.

679
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:29,879
Scott: Something else that needs to be mentioned, right, is the, you know, the tiger is a queen, right?

680
00:45:31,181 --> 00:45:39,000
Scott: And, you know, the guard, right, is also at least, you know, appears to be someone who is female.

681
00:45:39,621 --> 00:45:41,320
Rym: And they're clearly lovers.

682
00:45:41,884 --> 00:45:42,158
Rym: Clearly.

683
00:45:42,721 --> 00:45:48,173
Scott: Uh, it appears to me the queen 100%, right, is, like, you know, all over the guard.

684
00:45:51,929 --> 00:45:52,400
Scott: I don't know.

685
00:45:52,621 --> 00:45:53,919
Scott: The guard may be clueless.

686
00:45:54,661 --> 00:45:57,860
Rym: Well, yeah, the guard might be a disaster in that sense.

687
00:45:57,961 --> 00:45:59,340
Rym: The guard may be clueless.

688
00:45:59,641 --> 00:46:07,720
Rym: I get the impression the queen, like, elevated the guard to be close to her, but propriety prevented her from exploring that relationship.

689
00:46:07,921 --> 00:46:11,540
Rym: And now they're on the road and one's a tiger and we'll see where this goes.

690
00:46:13,441 --> 00:46:17,686
Scott: Yeah, clearly the queen, you know, chose this person to be their guard for, like, reasons, right?

691
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,099
Scott: And those that we know what the reasons are, right?

692
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:20,493
Rym: Yep.

693
00:46:20,921 --> 00:46:29,799
Rym: I don't think there are further plot reasons there, necessarily, because the plot stuff seems to revolve around the queen's brother and whatever the hell he was up to.

694
00:46:30,761 --> 00:46:34,900
Scott: I don't know what he didn't make any sense, right, because they don't they don't reveal too much, right?

695
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:35,658
Rym: Well, I like that, too.

696
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:42,320
Rym: Like, there's a scene where they're with the, uh, the animal people in the woods that were the swampy woods at one point being vague here for a reason.

697
00:46:42,761 --> 00:46:51,260
Rym: But even then, like, it's not super clear to the characters or even to the reader exactly why that goes south in a hurry and they get kicked out again.

698
00:46:51,361 --> 00:46:54,900
Rym: And things are very confusing and moving very fast in that regard.

699
00:46:55,381 --> 00:47:04,539
Rym: It's very unclear what anyone wants for real, except the main character, the guard, just wants to turn the queen into a human again.

700
00:47:04,981 --> 00:47:12,940
Rym: And the queen seems to also want to become a human again, but also seems to maybe be becoming something different that might have been intended.

701
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,480
Rym: Like, the plot might have been to make the queen different for a reason.

702
00:47:18,184 --> 00:47:19,759
Scott: Yeah, we just don't know what the reason is.

703
00:47:19,861 --> 00:47:20,260
Scott: Exactly.

704
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:23,620
Rym: I have no idea what anyone wants except the queen and the guard.

705
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:25,979
Rym: No, everyone else is basically a mystery to me.

706
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:38,060
Scott: So something on the art that I can't ignore is the coloring in this book is very, very interesting in that when you look at most pages, there are some pages that are exceptions.

707
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,240
Scott: Most pages are basically one or maybe two colors, right?

708
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:46,120
Scott: Like, you look at the whole page, all the panels on the whole.

709
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:47,320
Scott: Here's a two page spread.

710
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:49,120
Scott: Anyone who's watching the stream can maybe see this.

711
00:47:49,862 --> 00:47:51,780
Scott: It's a blue page, right?

712
00:47:52,363 --> 00:47:54,099
Scott: And then it's like, oh, I'll go over here.

713
00:47:54,783 --> 00:47:56,138
Scott: This is a purple page, right?

714
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:59,540
Scott: See, every single frame in the whole page is purple, right?

715
00:47:59,982 --> 00:48:04,620
Scott: And it's like, OK, here's a purple page with two blue frames.

716
00:48:05,221 --> 00:48:13,598
Rym: And it definitely the color scheme of any given layout definitely has ties to the perspective that you're seeing things from.

717
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:16,019
Scott: Here's some orange pages, right?

718
00:48:16,381 --> 00:48:18,360
Scott: It's like everything, no matter where you turn.

719
00:48:18,501 --> 00:48:20,299
Scott: And this holds true in volume two as well.

720
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:22,160
Scott: Yep, holds true in volume two as well.

721
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:34,699
Scott: Pretty much any page you turn to is one, maybe two colors and different, you know, the hue is the same and all the other variables on color saturation, etc.

722
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:35,769
Scott: Right.

723
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:44,220
Scott: Luminance are altered, but it'll be like almost like a solid hue for like a whole page or spreads.

724
00:48:45,822 --> 00:48:54,440
Rym: And it's definitely tied to the mood of the characters or the context of the story in some capacity or whether or not it's in the dream world.

725
00:48:54,822 --> 00:48:58,500
Rym: I'm not actually sure if there is a dream world or if that's more complicated.

726
00:48:59,493 --> 00:48:59,659
Scott: Yep.

727
00:49:00,061 --> 00:49:01,740
Scott: You can even see the colors of the trades.

728
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:05,640
Scott: Trade number one is the green trade and trade number two is the purple trade.

729
00:49:08,001 --> 00:49:18,400
Scott: Even like you don't have to be an artist to see, you know, this like it's such a. it's such like a bold, plain, like in your face artistic decision.

730
00:49:19,722 --> 00:49:23,020
Scott: And it really shows like the strength of the colorist.

731
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:28,139
Scott: It's like, OK, color, you decide you're going to make these all these four pages in a row, all purple.

732
00:49:28,708 --> 00:49:28,938
Scott: Right.

733
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:34,317
Scott: But still, everyone has to be able to tell who all the characters are and tell what all the objects are.

734
00:49:35,042 --> 00:49:37,340
Scott: But everything has to be purple, some shade of purple.

735
00:49:37,981 --> 00:49:41,838
Scott: But I also love to put green on this page or red or yellow or brown.

736
00:49:42,743 --> 00:49:43,676
Rym: I enjoy the history.

737
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:46,159
Scott: You got to make it purple in that context.

738
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:53,280
Rym: Watching the queen as a tiger try to interact with the other characters and the nonverbal communication.

739
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:57,840
Rym: The comic is mostly serious, significantly gory and violent.

740
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:03,980
Rym: Like this is a violent story, but it also at times is extremely funny.

741
00:50:04,581 --> 00:50:10,335
Rym: But that funniness is very brief and sort of punctuates everything else that's going on.

742
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:14,960
Scott: It's mostly very so far, very, very small amounts of humor.

743
00:50:15,089 --> 00:50:15,260
Scott: Right.

744
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,580
Scott: It's there, but it's very tiny.

745
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:17,937
Scott: It's like a. it's like a dusting.

746
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:18,722
Rym: Like there's.

747
00:50:18,742 --> 00:50:24,300
Rym: there is a moment when a character who seems to be able to communicate better with the queen is like basically sitting with the queen by himself.

748
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:27,700
Rym: And he's like, so, yeah, you're definitely completely in love with your guard.

749
00:50:27,845 --> 00:50:28,119
Rym: Right.

750
00:50:28,582 --> 00:50:31,180
Rym: And the queen reacts in an appropriately funny way.

751
00:50:31,641 --> 00:50:38,139
Rym: But then it gets into the transhumanist, like, shall we say, transhumanist nonsense two pages later.

752
00:50:39,229 --> 00:50:39,398
Scott: Yeah.

753
00:50:41,061 --> 00:50:46,500
Scott: And that just also brings to mind just the facial expressions of every single character.

754
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:47,100
Scott: Right.

755
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:51,140
Scott: Are like because there's actually not too many words in a lot of parts of the book.

756
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:51,858
Rym: Which I appreciate.

757
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:52,596
Rym: I like that.

758
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:59,400
Scott: It's like it's, you know, you know, comics in general became less wordy over time.

759
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:01,878
Rym: You know, you, you little guy.

760
00:51:02,649 --> 00:51:02,940
Scott: Right.

761
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:09,580
Scott: You know, of like the Silver Age and even, you know, where people would just say what was happening in the panel.

762
00:51:09,662 --> 00:51:09,870
Scott: Right.

763
00:51:10,363 --> 00:51:11,420
Scott: Instead of just showing.

764
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:11,899
Scott: Right.

765
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,699
Scott: And we learn not comic creators learn not to do that.

766
00:51:15,241 --> 00:51:22,260
Scott: But this goes even further towards, you know, saying really the bare minimum and showing everything with the artwork.

767
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:28,980
Scott: And so, you know, not just the human facial expressions telling you pretty much everything.

768
00:51:29,522 --> 00:51:32,959
Scott: But to be able to draw the tiger face expressions.

769
00:51:33,513 --> 00:51:33,720
Rym: Yeah.

770
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:40,418
Rym: Without showing everything the animal features, they still like you can tell when the queen is pissed.

771
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,780
Scott: This is not like a furry situation, though.

772
00:51:43,942 --> 00:51:44,556
Scott: I guess it might be.

773
00:51:44,841 --> 00:51:47,271
Scott: Well, it's like, yeah, the queen isn't it's not.

774
00:51:47,332 --> 00:51:49,220
Scott: it's not like a tiger person.

775
00:51:49,605 --> 00:51:50,619
Scott: It's just a tiger.

776
00:51:51,082 --> 00:51:52,659
Scott: It's black with blue stripes.

777
00:51:53,201 --> 00:51:59,760
Rym: There are just like there are characters you encounter who are sort of like mishmashes of human and animal traits, but not enough.

778
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:05,900
Rym: They're not in a stereotypical furry art way, but more in a monstrous and unique style.

779
00:52:06,755 --> 00:52:06,880
Scott: Yeah.

780
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:08,299
Scott: This is this is Siegfried and Roy.

781
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:09,139
Scott: Like it's a tiger.

782
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:10,871
Scott: It's not a it's not.

783
00:52:10,971 --> 00:52:11,979
Scott: it's not Tony the tiger.

784
00:52:14,904 --> 00:52:15,838
Scott: That's what I'm trying to say.

785
00:52:16,087 --> 00:52:16,298
Rym: Yep.

786
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:20,199
Rym: But I guess what I would say is like, I don't want to really say much more about it because it's great.

787
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:26,860
Rym: And if you want to read a comic, you've been reading comics lately and you're OK for something that's a little bit violent, but otherwise beautiful.

788
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:29,080
Scott: This saga is really worth reading.

789
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:31,320
Scott: I'm pretty sure Saga is still on hiatus.

790
00:52:31,981 --> 00:52:38,259
Scott: So this is your American not superhero comic to read right now.

791
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:42,400
Rym: I presume that volume three is coming out, right?

792
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,419
Scott: I presume volume three is coming out.

793
00:52:45,827 --> 00:52:46,339
Scott: At some point.

794
00:52:47,481 --> 00:52:50,980
Scott: I don't know when, but I'll preorder it just like I pre-order one and two.

795
00:52:51,761 --> 00:52:52,840
Scott: I actually didn't preorder one.

796
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:55,220
Scott: I found out about one afterwards and then I preordered.

797
00:52:55,401 --> 00:52:57,400
Rym: I just bought it on Comixology and read it on my laptop.

798
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:58,290
Scott: Yeah.

799
00:52:58,540 --> 00:52:59,500
Scott: That seems like a good idea.

800
00:53:02,163 --> 00:53:03,079
Scott: So, yeah, ESOLA.

801
00:53:03,301 --> 00:53:07,778
Scott: I S O L A. It is the comic to read right now.

802
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:15,760
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

803
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:20,879
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

804
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:26,300
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

805
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:29,240
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

806
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:34,000
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

808
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,780
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

809
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:44,920
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

810
00:53:46,622 --> 00:53:52,440
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights are Alan Joyce, Adam McNichol, Marty Granier, Graham Finch, Yule, the Key to My Heart.

811
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,120
Rym: If anything, I could say this cab was rare.

812
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:14,560
Rym: I actually have to hover over your name if it's longer than, like, 15 characters and wait for the tooltip to pop up to be able to read it.

813
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:18,279
Rym: That is actually super annoying and sometimes causes me trouble here.

814
00:54:18,682 --> 00:54:21,360
Rym: But anyway, make sure you go out and vote.

815
00:54:21,802 --> 00:54:22,580
Rym: It's kind of important.

816
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,139
Rym: And now I leave you with...
