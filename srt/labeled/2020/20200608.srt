1
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,132
Rym: It's Monday, June 8th, 2020.

2
00:00:12,132 --> 00:00:12,573
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,034 --> 00:00:15,119
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:15,159 --> 00:00:18,020
Rym: tonight We are talking about computer maintenance.

5
00:00:19,562 --> 00:00:20,595
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:21,746 --> 00:00:22,533
Rym: Cuz I got an opening bit.

7
00:00:25,287 --> 00:00:26,999
Scott: Is there another opening bit somewhere?

8
00:00:31,002 --> 00:00:37,810
Rym: So on a normal episode of GeekNights right now is where I talk about like my Quarantine beard and how it's getting kind of thick, you know, something like that.

9
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,418
Scott: Oh, and that's a normal episode a quarantine.

10
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,239
Rym: Yeah Well, I mean we're against the global pandemic.

11
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:47,032
Rym: We're all like misspeak and say oh the quarantine what I mean?

12
00:00:47,132 --> 00:00:49,078
Rym: their curfew the reason we hate that.

13
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:50,931
Rym: you all know Why we didn't do shows last week.

14
00:00:50,972 --> 00:00:55,673
Scott: shit is on fire Multiple things as if shit wasn't already on fire, right?

15
00:00:55,713 --> 00:00:57,360
Scott: It's like I did a GeekNights episode.

16
00:00:57,501 --> 00:00:59,159
Scott: What was it like the opening bit?

17
00:00:59,906 --> 00:01:08,541
Scott: Few months ago already Right where I was like listing all of the things that were on fire at once and now it's more on fire than it was Then.

18
00:01:08,862 --> 00:01:16,274
Rym: yep, so I'm not gonna talk about the trivialities of my quarantine beard because uh There's some important stuff going on.

19
00:01:16,696 --> 00:01:21,140
Rym: as you might have noticed We didn't do shows last week mostly because the movement was really picking up momentum.

20
00:01:21,601 --> 00:01:25,030
Rym: We didn't want to distract like if I look at my social media feed.

21
00:01:25,131 --> 00:01:27,116
Rym: even now, it's 99% people fighting.

22
00:01:29,265 --> 00:01:30,634
Rym: So yeah, we're getting worried.

23
00:01:30,654 --> 00:01:31,499
Rym: We're doing the show again.

24
00:01:32,303 --> 00:01:36,300
Rym: We're not gonna live stream the show for the foreseeable future because I don't want to take people's attention away.

25
00:01:36,681 --> 00:01:42,460
Rym: Listening to some podcast like when you have free time is different from like social media like hey check out our thing.

26
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:46,340
Rym: We're not gonna be talking about our games or anything that much on social media.

27
00:01:46,661 --> 00:01:47,486
Rym: We'll keep doing the show.

28
00:01:47,546 --> 00:01:52,727
Rym: but follow my Twitter for the foreseeable future It's pretty much gonna be videos of police attacking people.

29
00:01:53,389 --> 00:01:54,071
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

30
00:01:54,732 --> 00:02:03,337
Scott: but at the same time, you know people out there Still need you know to be able to escape to something else right to a degree.

31
00:02:03,618 --> 00:02:10,259
Rym: on one hand I believe that people should be able like there's entertainment like you can but also you shouldn't let people completely escape, right?

32
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:21,540
Rym: Yes, that's something I want to get because I posted, you know, we posted our statement basically saying we're not gonna like last week No shows because we just did not want to distract at all from what was going on or trivialize it or anything.

33
00:02:22,223 --> 00:02:32,320
Rym: But when I posted that announcement on YouTube one Individual responded pretty much right away saying yeah you guys talk about games and those are the kinds of things I want to hear.

34
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:37,193
Rym: But now that you're getting political I'm unsubscribing and I just have to make this very clear.

35
00:02:37,213 --> 00:02:38,617
Scott: See ya.

36
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:41,685
Scott: Fuck you, dude We don't watch you.

37
00:02:42,147 --> 00:02:44,519
Rym: Yeah racism is not a political opinion.

38
00:02:46,601 --> 00:02:52,585
Rym: So the news like the big news just to get it out like full disclose like that Just getting it everything out there.

39
00:02:52,605 --> 00:03:03,755
Rym: The most important news right now is the fact that we have this sort of literal Uprising against the police as they exist in America today in the middle of a global pandemic.

40
00:03:04,257 --> 00:03:04,698
Rym: It's good.

41
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:05,500
Rym: It's justified.

42
00:03:05,763 --> 00:03:23,030
Rym: I'm on the side of these protesters and If nothing else I would suggest if you are a patreon patron of GeekNights If you turned off our patreon and pointed that money at one of these black lives matter causes for the foreseeable future I'm not gonna much.

43
00:03:23,131 --> 00:03:24,880
Scott: Why did why did you ever give us money?

44
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,039
Rym: Yeah, we got fans people like us.

45
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:34,424
Rym: But I'm not gonna be posting much exclusive content in there for a while because the money money needs to be going to these other Causes right now.

46
00:03:34,465 --> 00:03:37,039
Scott: So why don't you just route all incoming monies?

47
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,700
Rym: I am actually doing any substantial amounts of money to these things.

48
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:50,943
Scott: I'm saying specifically all patreon money is 100% will just forward because you show, you know Being like.

49
00:03:51,003 --> 00:03:55,919
Scott: if we forward our patreon to someone else's patreon patreon itself gets the fee twice.

50
00:03:56,039 --> 00:04:00,493
Rym: also I will still be paying income taxes on that reducing the effectiveness of those donations.

51
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:10,810
Rym: and you cannot say yeah, that's how it goes because I can't itemize my deductions because Donald Trump and the Republicans got rid of the ability for most people Living in places like New York.

52
00:04:11,072 --> 00:04:13,897
Scott: the itemized deductions What that's not true at all.

53
00:04:14,983 --> 00:04:24,863
Rym: The standard deduction is greater than itemized deductions for a lot of people now Especially if you it's because the only thing that changed that was significant is now your state tax is not Deductible.

54
00:04:24,883 --> 00:04:28,700
Rym: state tax is being deductible was the only reason I could itemize my deductions previously.

55
00:04:29,342 --> 00:04:33,075
Scott: Well, you can just donate so much that you clear the throw the.

56
00:04:33,677 --> 00:04:40,540
Rym: you know the fence Yep, but you also can't like I can't say that I'm going to take money from the patreon and donate it.

57
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,867
Rym: That's against the terms of service.

58
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:43,576
Rym: You can't make promises like that.

59
00:04:43,596 --> 00:04:46,285
Scott: Oh Fascinating a lot.

60
00:04:46,306 --> 00:04:49,755
Rym: a lot of places like patreon and kickstarter have rules about that.

61
00:04:50,076 --> 00:04:54,180
Scott: because okay in that case We don't promise we'll do that.

62
00:04:55,101 --> 00:05:00,920
Rym: Yeah, all I'm saying is if we lose a bunch of patreon patrons for the neck for like that during all this.

63
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,066
Rym: I'm not gonna complain at all.

64
00:05:03,868 --> 00:05:11,928
Scott: And if you're on the side of the if you're on the side of the the current government or police Why are you listening to the show?

65
00:05:11,969 --> 00:05:13,737
Rym: go away so I'll link to you.

66
00:05:13,877 --> 00:05:14,400
Rym: don't like you?

67
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,588
Scott: We don't want to hear that.

68
00:05:15,709 --> 00:05:17,280
Scott: I could thank you from listening.

69
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:27,840
Rym: I would because this donation page will basically split your monthly donations across a Good variety of really good vetted organizations that are fighting for these causes.

70
00:05:28,741 --> 00:05:31,660
Scott: And if you said it, you know, you want to set it to be monthly, right?

71
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,872
Scott: Because basically some of these groups have gotten so much money.

72
00:05:34,892 --> 00:05:36,358
Scott: They don't even know what to do with it all right now.

73
00:05:38,042 --> 00:05:40,979
Scott: So you got to go to the ones lower down the list but still the legit ones.

74
00:05:41,301 --> 00:05:45,013
Rym: but a small monthly contribution matters a lot more than one big country.

75
00:05:45,033 --> 00:05:46,358
Scott: monthly is where it's at.

76
00:05:46,418 --> 00:05:53,520
Scott: because You know, we don't want to let anything Peter out right, but you know, it's gonna happen eventually.

77
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:59,319
Scott: Hopefully we can you know, hold on long enough to make some significant wins right.

78
00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:01,370
Scott: right now I'm only seeing kind of mayor wins.

79
00:06:01,431 --> 00:06:02,839
Scott: I want to see big wins, right?

80
00:06:04,062 --> 00:06:10,460
Scott: But if you just don't turn off that monthly thing right cancel all your other shit first cancel your Netflix first to your crunchyroll first.

81
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:19,237
Scott: Right, keep that monthly biz on and never turn it off until it's like, you know I guess you would turn it off before you turn off the electricity, right?

82
00:06:19,539 --> 00:06:25,520
Rym: Yeah But because remember these organizations will just do good and make the world better.

83
00:06:25,681 --> 00:06:29,540
Scott: They and these kinds like a year from now, right when you know, it's like shit.

84
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,331
Scott: Even if we get big wins shit ain't gonna be perfect.

85
00:06:32,532 --> 00:06:34,279
Scott: There's still a ton of racists out there, right?

86
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,759
Scott: There's still a bunch of you know bad cops out there.

87
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,743
Scott: I mean even now.

88
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:42,960
Rym: today 38% of Americans are literally on the side of the fascists like they want it.

89
00:06:43,702 --> 00:06:46,380
Scott: And it's not just in America, right?

90
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,774
Scott: You know, we got the protests are going on all over the world, right.

91
00:06:50,095 --> 00:06:55,272
Scott: and you know, for example in England They threw the slave trading statue into the into the the drink, right?

92
00:06:55,673 --> 00:07:00,527
Scott: I just saw today, you know some three I assume racist white dudes pulling out.

93
00:07:00,908 --> 00:07:01,831
Scott: They were trying to pull it out.

94
00:07:01,891 --> 00:07:05,100
Scott: Anyway, it was pretty funny-looking picture.

95
00:07:08,263 --> 00:07:11,400
Scott: So those dudes will probably be alive I assume next year.

96
00:07:11,561 --> 00:07:16,333
Scott: So we're still gonna be need to fight in them next year even if we defund police and such and such.

97
00:07:16,474 --> 00:07:16,876
Scott: yep,

98
00:07:17,258 --> 00:07:32,135
Rym: but the Biggest thing I want to say before we move on to other news is because we're basically gonna talk about this Every episode for the foreseeable future because we're at this crisis point right now, but I cannot stress enough These protests in particular because of their momentum and because of their staying power.

99
00:07:32,817 --> 00:07:33,740
Rym: It's working.

100
00:07:34,461 --> 00:07:35,811
Rym: Changes are happening.

101
00:07:35,852 --> 00:07:38,146
Rym: They're not the big changes They're not the ones we want.

102
00:07:38,187 --> 00:07:43,791
Rym: but like the Minneapolis City Council said yes We want to disband our own police department and we're going to do it.

103
00:07:44,092 --> 00:07:45,377
Rym: We have a veto.

104
00:07:45,437 --> 00:07:46,300
Rym: mayor didn't join.

105
00:07:47,146 --> 00:07:48,879
Rym: Yeah, they can override the mayor.

106
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,248
Scott: Yeah, you know the New York City mayor.

107
00:07:52,288 --> 00:07:58,649
Scott: He's like, yeah, I'll do a little bit and we're like no no, no You should do a lot more than that right.

108
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:03,165
Scott: but you know politicians who were you know Progressive right?

109
00:08:03,205 --> 00:08:06,860
Scott: They were standing for things like, you know bail reform and whatnot, right?

110
00:08:08,122 --> 00:08:24,255
Scott: You know, it's like but they weren't pushing for the kinds of you know, even these sort of Compromised things that they're a lot, you know sort of supporting right now, right the sort of halfway measures No, that wasn't even on their agenda previously, right?

111
00:08:24,897 --> 00:08:29,978
Scott: And that's the thing, you know These and these are progressive representatives like, you know, the ones that I vote for.

112
00:08:29,998 --> 00:08:34,214
Rym: Yeah It wasn't that long ago the mayor of New York de Blasio.

113
00:08:34,496 --> 00:08:39,960
Rym: the scandal around him Was that because he even vaguely hinted that the police needed to be more accountable?

114
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:46,000
Rym: The police union like rose up against him and like all turned their backs on him and threatened to primary him and all.

115
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,784
Scott: I think he's still.

116
00:08:46,845 --> 00:08:47,710
Scott: he's still scared of that.

117
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,178
Rym: Oh, yeah, he's a hundred percent scared of that.

118
00:08:49,198 --> 00:08:56,464
Rym: and But the point is these little changes like yes the bill the Democrats just announced in Congress doesn't go far Enough, but you know what?

119
00:08:56,866 --> 00:08:59,359
Rym: When was the last time we had a conversation about a bill like this?

120
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:06,360
Rym: These little changes matter, but even if we get rid of Trump, we got a Democratic president Democratic House Democrat Senate.

121
00:09:06,962 --> 00:09:10,533
Rym: We still have to keep pulling that window more and more left whatever they agree to.

122
00:09:10,574 --> 00:09:12,359
Rym: We just got to say something even further out.

123
00:09:13,105 --> 00:09:13,832
Scott: No, it's working.

124
00:09:14,196 --> 00:09:18,752
Rym: So Yeah, you heard it here first Scott Scott Rubin on GeekNights.

125
00:09:18,772 --> 00:09:21,580
Rym: Just admitted that the protests are having an effect.

126
00:09:22,622 --> 00:09:24,837
Scott: No, I mean, you know, it's doing something.

127
00:09:25,058 --> 00:09:26,965
Scott: Yeah The thing is it only works.

128
00:09:27,427 --> 00:09:30,720
Scott: right, you know, this is something I've believed for a long time, right?

129
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:36,720
Scott: Is you know, you look at the history of you know, non-violent or mostly nonviolent protests like Gandhi and such, right?

130
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,327
Scott: You know, it's like what a Gandhi right?

131
00:09:39,347 --> 00:09:40,211
Scott: For example, right?

132
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:48,920
Scott: He did a lot of hunger strike action, right and The point is is like Gandhi won a hunger strike and people were like, no, they didn't want Gandhi to die.

133
00:09:50,161 --> 00:09:51,926
Scott: It's like they sort of felt bad.

134
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:56,880
Rym: the British people even if it was pure self-interest of the optics are bad for us right there.

135
00:09:57,501 --> 00:09:58,103
Scott: Right, exactly.

136
00:09:58,143 --> 00:10:04,300
Scott: Some people will do the right thing for you reasons as as evil and imperialist and awful as they were.

137
00:10:04,721 --> 00:10:06,987
Scott: Right, they were, you know, extremely awful.

138
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:09,134
Scott: I don't want to let that go right.

139
00:10:09,595 --> 00:10:19,208
Scott: there was some amount of heart involved in which Enlightened and selfish self-interests Yes something that there would.

140
00:10:19,248 --> 00:10:26,480
Scott: you know that the like an action such as Gandhi's hunger strike would work on them and influence them and change their actions, right?

141
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,951
Scott: But you look say at the US right today.

142
00:10:29,972 --> 00:10:34,689
Scott: It's like okay these large protests They're moving, you know, who are they moving?

143
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:37,980
Scott: mayors governors and largely Democratic places?

144
00:10:38,581 --> 00:10:40,754
Scott: You know are being moved by.

145
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:45,020
Scott: you know These largely nonviolent protests, right?

146
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,043
Scott: It's like that.

147
00:10:46,123 --> 00:10:46,806
Scott: it affects them.

148
00:10:47,409 --> 00:10:56,080
Scott: but people who are just you know Cruel and evil right who don't give a shit like the president they are unmoved, right?

149
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,123
Scott: It doesn't work on them.

150
00:10:57,183 --> 00:10:58,928
Rym: Nothing will move them, right?

151
00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:00,453
Scott: It's they're unmovable, right?

152
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:06,200
Scott: So it's like if I you know, it's like When you talk about nonviolent protests working, right?

153
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:11,780
Scott: It works on people who you know, at least to some even a small extent listen, right?

154
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:17,460
Scott: Someone who is beyond that point to where they don't care anymore, right that no longer work.

155
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:23,280
Rym: But then that's when you can protest can make them care either by causing economic disruption or social disruption.

156
00:11:23,441 --> 00:11:24,386
Scott: Yes that you need to.

157
00:11:24,406 --> 00:11:25,310
Scott: you need something like that.

158
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:30,400
Scott: But anyway, yep, so Just direct action gets the goods and it's working.

159
00:11:30,581 --> 00:11:45,135
Rym: Yep, so just in case it wasn't clear to the why especially to that one fucko who I banned from our YouTube channel Black lives matter and we support this movement 100% Mm-hmm, and if you're bothered by that how the fuck did you listen to us for 15 years?

160
00:11:45,195 --> 00:11:46,439
Rym: Like what the fuck?

161
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:51,633
Rym: All right, is there any other news?

162
00:11:51,713 --> 00:11:53,680
Rym: now that we've gotten past the most important news?

163
00:11:56,002 --> 00:12:00,473
Rym: You sent me something about a really funny Google story Did I?

164
00:12:00,675 --> 00:12:05,089
Scott: oh, yes So Google+ died a long time ago.

165
00:12:05,109 --> 00:12:06,654
Scott: I don't even remember right?

166
00:12:06,795 --> 00:12:07,598
Scott: Yeah, it died.

167
00:12:07,678 --> 00:12:08,240
Rym: rest in peace.

168
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,071
Rym: It was used by the indie RPG community.

169
00:12:11,112 --> 00:12:13,060
Rym: And as far as I can tell literally no one else.

170
00:12:13,542 --> 00:12:21,780
Scott: It was the only good use of it was the indie RPG community regardless For people who are using G suite, right?

171
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,402
Scott: Which are basically?

172
00:12:22,462 --> 00:12:28,540
Scott: companies are paying to use Google to manage, you know to use Gmail instead of Outlook for their company.

173
00:12:29,886 --> 00:12:31,594
Scott: And have you know, Google Drive for the company?

174
00:12:31,634 --> 00:12:32,739
Scott: my company uses it, right?

175
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,134
Scott: They are rolling out what used to be Google+.

176
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:38,480
Scott: they've rejiggered it.

177
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:46,778
Scott: It's the same software with a whole bunch of stuff done to what I presume It is now called Google currents not to be confused with a previous product.

178
00:12:46,818 --> 00:12:47,480
Rym: God damn it.

179
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,829
Scott: Google used to make something called Google currents.

180
00:12:50,929 --> 00:12:53,859
Scott: That was like a magazine app that eventually became Google news.

181
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:57,673
Rym: What about Google wave which would be currents of water?

182
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:00,284
Scott: no Google wave is just dead day I know.

183
00:13:00,345 --> 00:13:04,162
Scott: so this Google currents is simply Google+ Rejiggered.

184
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:08,728
Scott: it's only for people who are using G suite So companies not individual people.

185
00:13:08,768 --> 00:13:16,259
Scott: you won't see it if you just have a regular old Gmail account And they're rolling it out as sort of like a Google+ for your company, right?

186
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:30,493
Scott: internally you have a little Google+ that all your employees can use together, but no one else and It's sort of kind of like a slack Microsoft Teams SharePoint competitor, maybe I don't even know SharePoint.

187
00:13:30,513 --> 00:13:31,136
Scott: still a thing.

188
00:13:31,157 --> 00:13:33,959
Scott: I don't know I never even I've heard of it, but I never actually used it.

189
00:13:36,443 --> 00:13:38,658
Scott: But yeah, we'll see if anyone uses this or cares.

190
00:13:41,068 --> 00:13:43,871
Scott: But yeah It's something to keep an eye on.

191
00:13:43,891 --> 00:13:53,373
Scott: I guess I Would be very shocked if I want to hear if anyone's company Adopts Google currents and uses it a lot.

192
00:13:53,534 --> 00:13:54,720
Rym: Yeah, I would like very interest.

193
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,948
Scott: I want to know about that company and the people who work.

194
00:13:56,968 --> 00:14:02,180
Rym: the problem is even if it solves all these problems I don't even think Google employees will do it.

195
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:14,296
Rym: No, but even if it's great like even if it's like the best user experience anyone's ever come up with for this kind of thing No one could trust Google to not shut it down right after you start to adopt it.

196
00:14:14,336 --> 00:14:25,414
Rym: because Google is shut down Effectively this thing so many times like if I get bit by the same dog five times in a row I'm gonna stop trying to pet that dog on the one hand.

197
00:14:25,454 --> 00:14:26,620
Scott: Yes, that is correct.

198
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:31,452
Scott: However, as Google's graveyard is vast of the products that they have shut down.

199
00:14:31,974 --> 00:14:36,669
Scott: They have shut down very very few G-suite products, right?

200
00:14:36,689 --> 00:14:44,940
Rym: Well because that is the difference between the products They give to people because the people are the products and the products they sell for money, right?

201
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:55,940
Scott: So if you have a g-suite account with your company Right your company can choose How many Google products to give you access to and they can even buy more third-party products and like add them in and stuff.

202
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,025
Scott: But we're don't worry about that.

203
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:57,326
Scott: Right?

204
00:14:57,366 --> 00:15:05,420
Scott: So for example, I could use my company's Login to log into YouTube if I wanted to and start uploading videos, right?

205
00:15:05,902 --> 00:15:06,404
Scott: They didn't put.

206
00:15:06,485 --> 00:15:09,780
Scott: my company chose not to put a restriction on that as far as I'm aware.

207
00:15:10,423 --> 00:15:12,491
Scott: I haven't tried it, but I just assume it will work.

208
00:15:12,872 --> 00:15:13,796
Scott: but they could.

209
00:15:13,856 --> 00:15:21,037
Scott: they could say no YouTube right and therefore everyone at the company who wants to log into YouTube would have to use their personal Gmail account and not the company one.

210
00:15:21,178 --> 00:15:25,095
Scott: Yeah So they could also as if your company and you had.

211
00:15:25,135 --> 00:15:26,160
Scott: you're paying for g-suite.

212
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:31,353
Scott: You could be like no Google Docs And no one can use Google Docs with those accounts because you just turned it off.

213
00:15:31,393 --> 00:15:34,713
Scott: so your company could turn on or off Google Currents for your company.

214
00:15:34,754 --> 00:15:38,060
Scott: Yeah And they could also turn on and off other Google products.

215
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:53,245
Scott: So those other Google products right could be shut down But the what some Google products like Google Docs have special functionality for companies Gmail Google Docs Google Calendar Google Google Meet Google Hangout.

216
00:15:53,426 --> 00:15:59,507
Scott: well, which is now Google chat or whatever the hell they're calling single sign-on integration Google Voice Google Currents.

217
00:15:59,628 --> 00:16:10,040
Scott: these Google products have special company integration for g-suite Specifically and as far as I'm aware I could be wrong probably None of those have been shut down.

218
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:15,780
Scott: Some of them have morphed but none of them have been shut down because there are companies using them and paying for them.

219
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:22,767
Scott: Yep, and while I see that it's only those other products that even though you're using on a company account You might log into it those, you know, whatever.

220
00:16:22,847 --> 00:16:29,260
Scott: but the company specific products the g-suite specific ones as far as I'm aware Have not hit the graveyard.

221
00:16:29,623 --> 00:16:36,960
Rym: But while I see that and I see what you said I would not be an early adopter of this if I had a small company where I was in charge of those decisions.

222
00:16:37,341 --> 00:16:38,926
Scott: No, why the hell would you?

223
00:16:38,946 --> 00:16:40,551
Scott: not even sorry not even useful.

224
00:16:40,812 --> 00:16:43,380
Scott: it's like even if you adopted it and stayed alive what good.

225
00:16:44,621 --> 00:16:48,694
Rym: So in some other news, uh, this is gaming adjacent, but it's an art.

226
00:16:48,734 --> 00:16:50,460
Rym: It's something I want to talk about in the light of technology.

227
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:57,800
Rym: Smites Reviewed chat logs like they have archives like if I write a video game company and there was chat in the game.

228
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:02,336
Rym: They're probably be some like terrifying archive of anything anyone ever said in the game.

229
00:17:03,119 --> 00:17:15,280
Rym: So Basically as best I can tell what they did is they went through a whole bunch of their chat logs looking for like Obviously racist things and just started retroactively banning anyone who was racist.

230
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:20,319
Scott: Like don't wait some people don't know smite is I believe it's a paid-of-winnish kind of game.

231
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,848
Scott: I don't know about that, but it's basically.

232
00:17:21,867 --> 00:17:23,577
Scott: it's a MOBA with a third-person view.

233
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,143
Scott: Yeah, it's sort of like.

234
00:17:25,263 --> 00:17:29,880
Scott: it's sort of like playing a third-person shooter, but you're it's a MOBA like like dota, right?

235
00:17:30,922 --> 00:17:32,590
Scott: And yeah, this games on a lot of platforms.

236
00:17:32,631 --> 00:17:33,656
Scott: I've seen the game around.

237
00:17:33,696 --> 00:17:37,377
Scott: I've never played it You know, it's not really my kind of game.

238
00:17:38,302 --> 00:17:41,654
Scott: But yeah, the thing is why did it take this long and how could no one else?

239
00:17:41,674 --> 00:17:43,260
Rym: Yeah, why is anyone else doing it?

240
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:48,758
Rym: Why do I have to report every time someone says the n-word like in a random overwatch game like hey this person.

241
00:17:48,778 --> 00:17:53,020
Rym: and then later They tell me that oh this person got in trouble because of you just go through the rocks.

242
00:17:53,582 --> 00:17:59,020
Scott: The reporting should be for this, you know, those things that fall through the cracks because automated systems can't catch everything.

243
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:04,359
Scott: Yeah, the reporting helps tune and reporting should not be the first system and this just applies to I think everything.

244
00:18:05,481 --> 00:18:08,508
Scott: Also in a somewhat related news, right?

245
00:18:08,528 --> 00:18:14,804
Scott: I believe there was like some sort of Pathfinder online Platform.

246
00:18:14,824 --> 00:18:15,930
Scott: Oh the Pathfinder.

247
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,760
Scott: Oh, no the Pathfinder Facebook group.

248
00:18:19,343 --> 00:18:21,434
Rym: Oh, wow, man, you just said two things.

249
00:18:21,494 --> 00:18:22,560
Rym: I would never interact with.

250
00:18:23,323 --> 00:18:26,960
Scott: Oh, yeah, the Pathfinder Facebook group banned all their racist members.

251
00:18:27,261 --> 00:18:30,312
Scott: I don't know why they took them this long to do that, but they they just did it.

252
00:18:31,436 --> 00:18:39,073
Scott: the next week Basically, they saw a drop in harassing and threatening posts of all kinds, huh?

253
00:18:39,354 --> 00:18:41,820
Rym: It's almost like there's a correlation there.

254
00:18:42,841 --> 00:18:44,167
Scott: Yeah, you know.

255
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:44,569
Scott: but

256
00:18:45,172 --> 00:18:53,820
Rym: any technology company Especially companies that are small enough to not be like an ISP or run into like word common carrier stuff Like if you're just a video game

257
00:18:54,702 --> 00:18:54,762
Scott: It

258
00:18:54,802 --> 00:19:02,100
Rym: would be pretty trivial to do some control F's like full-text searches through your database or your logs of chads.

259
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:06,210
Rym: you could probably find a lot of really low hanging fruit to ban.

260
00:19:06,731 --> 00:19:12,429
Rym: and if your first instinct is but what if I Ban too many people in my game fails.

261
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:14,660
Rym: That just means your game was only popular with racists.

262
00:19:15,463 --> 00:19:16,306
Scott: Yeah, I mean.

263
00:19:16,326 --> 00:19:21,344
Scott: basically it's like, you know, we talk a lot about you know, like codes of conduct Which we're still working on.

264
00:19:21,385 --> 00:19:22,951
Scott: please come discuss it with us.

265
00:19:22,991 --> 00:19:30,420
Scott: right and various, you know All these, you know semantic arguments and how to write rules for how to behave in the community, right?

266
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:38,320
Scott: But those rules are really for you know, people who are generally good right and it's just to sort of keep them off the ledge.

267
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,045
Rym: Yep, they're also for the edge cases.

268
00:19:40,086 --> 00:19:44,600
Rym: Like how do we handle this complicated question of like historical violence, right?

269
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:53,240
Scott: It's like there are so many easy bans that you know We just haven't had to deal with those because they don't even make it into the our community in the first place.

270
00:19:53,260 --> 00:20:00,430
Scott: Yeah, but like if you if you have if you have a large community like this game smite There's a lot of people who are just easy bands.

271
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:02,036
Scott: You don't need any adjudication.

272
00:20:02,176 --> 00:20:05,125
Scott: You don't need any discussion You don't need any complicated rules.

273
00:20:05,206 --> 00:20:08,896
Scott: It's like you said the n-word permanent bad done the exit.

274
00:20:09,037 --> 00:20:18,285
Rym: We don't need nothing else Right and the story so much low-hanging fruit and they just like no one's willing to do it and props to smite for doing The retroactive bands.

275
00:20:18,325 --> 00:20:19,428
Rym: I want to see a lot more of this.

276
00:20:20,171 --> 00:20:22,377
Scott: Yeah, it's like just friggin I would love to see.

277
00:20:22,498 --> 00:20:25,002
Scott: I really wish Like.

278
00:20:25,042 --> 00:20:28,840
Scott: if I were I I don't know how possible it'd be because people could always stop payment.

279
00:20:29,303 --> 00:20:35,531
Scott: But if I mean I would want to make a video game with like a monthly payment You bring this idea up a lot or like a deposit.

280
00:20:36,032 --> 00:20:41,794
Scott: and if you're if we if we find a reason to ban you Not only do we ban you but we like fine you right?

281
00:20:41,834 --> 00:20:46,760
Scott: Just like you get fined in sports It's like oh you're playing a counter-strike 50 cents a month, you know We?

282
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,880
Scott: just so that we have here a reet we can know that we have a real credit card on a file.

283
00:20:50,262 --> 00:20:51,310
Scott: Oh, you said a bad word.

284
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:56,235
Scott: Boom thousand dollars Deal with it way back.

285
00:20:56,376 --> 00:20:59,626
Rym: This was like Seven ish years ago.

286
00:20:59,686 --> 00:21:13,280
Rym: whenever I was I was enforcing in the live streaming team but I remember trying to moderate like a fast-moving twitch chat live and The racism came by faster than like any team could deal with and the tools didn't exist to deal with it effectively.

287
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:26,380
Rym: The the technology exists is do something like this where AI is not used to try to do auto bands or anything because that Tends to have its own problems when people seed the system with fake data to try to trip it out.

288
00:21:26,881 --> 00:21:39,168
Rym: but instead you need a system to like flag the things that are most likely to have been problematic from a Previous event so that you could have a moderation team that then does the slow work of Looking through and saying yes.

289
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,940
Rym: No to tune the algorithm instead of relying on your community to do it.

290
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,548
Scott: Yeah, especially when it's just text, right?

291
00:21:44,588 --> 00:21:51,125
Scott: Yeah, you know, it's like voice chats hard right videos hard But if it's just text you're dealing with there's no excuse.

292
00:21:51,246 --> 00:22:01,219
Rym: Yep, but anyway things Of the day what he got?

293
00:22:02,124 --> 00:22:20,731
Scott: So I think we might have talked about this on GeekNights before Possibly But there was a woman named Marion Stokes and from the year 1975 ish up to like 2012 She recorded television 24 hours a day seven days a week on VHS tapes.

294
00:22:20,852 --> 00:22:26,029
Scott: each VHS tapes about four hours long Right times about 70 over 70,000 tapes.

295
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:30,080
Scott: That's 30 years of video just straight, right?

296
00:22:30,943 --> 00:22:35,159
Scott: Thanks to this one person right this miraculous heroic effort, right?

297
00:22:36,042 --> 00:22:36,865
Scott: That no one knew about.

298
00:22:37,287 --> 00:22:40,660
Scott: but now the Internet Archive has the tapes and is digitizing them.

299
00:22:41,183 --> 00:22:50,712
Scott: Right, so, you know, I'm sure like TV stations Keep video of everything but they keep it and you know If they did they probably don't have it going back to 75 and

300
00:22:50,853 --> 00:22:55,832
Rym: often they won't have like what was Broadcast on this date so much as they'll have the live stuff.

301
00:22:55,852 --> 00:23:00,719
Rym: They recorded they'll have like the show But the commercials were stuck in like at the time.

302
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,831
Rym: Commercials aren't necessarily part of whatever tape they archived right?

303
00:23:04,851 --> 00:23:07,700
Scott: They would have you know, they would have like the programs, right?

304
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,283
Scott: They'd be like, okay.

305
00:23:08,343 --> 00:23:09,550
Scott: This program is broadcast.

306
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,340
Scott: Here's the footage of that program, right?

307
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:16,320
Scott: But they wouldn't have like, you know the TV as it was shown on TV, right?

308
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,160
Scott: I've been shown different things in different places on different channels at different times.

309
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:29,331
Rym: It might have been a breaking news that co-opted some programming or preempted it and you wouldn't have that context of What did people actually see in the real world when this news broadcast?

310
00:23:29,371 --> 00:23:31,617
Scott: and also people who have archives like this.

311
00:23:31,758 --> 00:23:34,104
Scott: for some reason They don't open them right.

312
00:23:34,184 --> 00:23:38,997
Scott: libraries have archives but companies that keep archives keep them for themselves.

313
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:39,860
Scott: They don't share them.

314
00:23:40,281 --> 00:23:45,060
Rym: I don't know why a lot of times they don't have the right to redistribute the content because so many people are involved.

315
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:45,604
Scott: There's a lot of.

316
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:46,550
Scott: there's a lot of reasons.

317
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:49,509
Scott: Yeah, there's a lot but you know Regardless of the fact that there are reasons.

318
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:51,057
Scott: the fact is they don't do it.

319
00:23:52,309 --> 00:23:59,220
Scott: So this is an amazing Archive to have and there was a documentary made called recorder the Marion Stokes project.

320
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:01,288
Scott: It's like a two-hour long documentary.

321
00:24:01,349 --> 00:24:03,799
Scott: I think it was shown at a film festival recently.

322
00:24:05,721 --> 00:24:06,944
Scott: Regardless it's about.

323
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:16,671
Scott: it contains obviously a lot of footage from the tapes, but it's also about right this woman And they're showing it on PBS soon.

324
00:24:17,032 --> 00:24:19,300
Scott: So you can watch it on PBS the documentary.

325
00:24:19,942 --> 00:24:30,170
Scott: But also here is an event bright link for a special online event, which is going to be on June 16th June 16th at 7 30 p.m.

326
00:24:30,291 --> 00:24:39,218
Scott: Eastern which will include Online showing of the documentary right and then some Q&A like you would get at.

327
00:24:39,379 --> 00:24:41,485
Scott: you know A special a special showing.

328
00:24:41,565 --> 00:24:42,267
Scott: only it's online.

329
00:24:42,909 --> 00:24:46,400
Scott: So you register here for free this little event bright link, right?

330
00:24:47,805 --> 00:24:50,340
Scott: And Yeah, this is some pretty amazing stuff.

331
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:57,694
Scott: And if you want to you know, make sure that things like this, you know are preserved for all humanity and the best way We know how.

332
00:24:58,662 --> 00:24:59,896
Scott: Internet archive pretty good.

333
00:25:01,042 --> 00:25:04,760
Rym: So my thing of the day apropos of nothing is just a very simple interesting video.

334
00:25:05,981 --> 00:25:15,959
Rym: as you know, I follow and often talk about the lectures of DV and Olam who talks a lot about operational security and Lockpicking and elevators and fun stuff like that.

335
00:25:16,401 --> 00:25:29,980
Rym: but this is just a video from his YouTube channel of him demonstrating the 1284 X fleet key, which Basically is the key that almost every police car in America uses and it's a really short video.

336
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:37,928
Rym: He uploaded it himself and he just takes this key that you can buy on eBay for like four or five Dollars or just make yourself.

337
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:43,540
Rym: and he goes over to some random police car Opens it sits down and starts the engine.

338
00:25:45,261 --> 00:25:46,486
Rym: This is the same guy who did that talk.

339
00:25:46,506 --> 00:25:57,540
Rym: I'd I used as a thing today a long time ago about elevator hacking but this is pretty interesting and So I guess I should slip into one more news then because the Internet Archive might go bankrupt.

340
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:04,055
Rym: Maybe we'll see Internet Archive is currently being sued by basically all these book publishers.

341
00:26:04,116 --> 00:26:17,620
Rym: It looks like for Infinite money saying that it's just a quote willful digital piracy on an industrial scale and It's not clear if the Internet Archive even has the money and the legal resources to fight back effectively.

342
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:22,340
Scott: Well, there's a lot the many many people who come to the defense of the Internet Archive.

343
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,790
Scott: I sure hope so many that many many people should include you.

344
00:26:26,553 --> 00:26:28,920
Scott: Yeah listening in the meta moment.

345
00:26:29,382 --> 00:26:32,171
Rym: I've not read much more of the tale of Hanzo just yet.

346
00:26:32,191 --> 00:26:33,817
Scott: No, I haven't read any.

347
00:26:33,837 --> 00:26:42,912
Rym: I've been reading other stuff Yep, but I can go outside again, and I'm doing long runs and bikes again meaning at some I will Occasionally just stop out at a park and read.

348
00:26:42,993 --> 00:26:46,722
Rym: so I think I'm gonna start reading this book again imminently Mm-hmm.

349
00:26:46,742 --> 00:26:51,840
Scott: I mean my main problem is I was reading it with my phone reading strategy which involved the subway.

350
00:26:52,302 --> 00:26:58,493
Rym: So, oh, yeah, even if we start going back to work at some point, which I doubt I'm not gonna be on a subway anytime soon.

351
00:26:59,157 --> 00:26:59,480
Scott: Yeah, no.

352
00:27:00,681 --> 00:27:02,980
Rym: Otherwise, I mean obviously we have no conventions planned.

353
00:27:03,702 --> 00:27:09,060
Rym: Pax the next possible convention has not made any announcements and honestly, it's not looking so good.

354
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:15,139
Scott: Yeah, if tickets for PAX West 2020 were to go on sale, they would be going on sale quite soon.

355
00:27:15,641 --> 00:27:23,404
Rym: Also, we would have already submitted our panels and like already be talking about like the final schedule and like there's a lot of stuff That would already have happened.

356
00:27:23,424 --> 00:27:27,698
Scott: that seems unlikely even though they have not officially canceled it.

357
00:27:27,798 --> 00:27:32,129
Scott: However Uh Yeah, we'll see what happens.

358
00:27:32,189 --> 00:27:32,833
Scott: if there's no what?

359
00:27:32,873 --> 00:27:37,651
Scott: the last time I was April 20 I would not worry about camping for those badges.

360
00:27:37,752 --> 00:27:40,340
Scott: nor would I if they do go on sale.

361
00:27:40,481 --> 00:27:44,160
Scott: You should be able to buy one easily because most people will not be buying.

362
00:27:44,441 --> 00:27:55,053
Rym: Yep, and even if you buy one, I would suggest not booking your flights right away necessarily Because unless they only but only pay for things you can cancel or return.

363
00:27:55,314 --> 00:28:00,160
Scott: Yep, and we'll see what happens Otherwise gonna Ford don't have that money being held up somewhere.

364
00:28:00,481 --> 00:28:06,704
Rym: Otherwise, we're keeping an eye out for good online conventions to do panel content at because we should be able to get together to do Some live panels.

365
00:28:07,326 --> 00:28:08,049
Rym: stay tuned on that.

366
00:28:08,109 --> 00:28:14,140
Rym: if there is an online convention you would like us to perform at Point their laser at us and we will see what we can do.

367
00:28:15,121 --> 00:28:15,241
Scott: Mm-hmm.

368
00:28:15,824 --> 00:28:16,165
Scott: I'm gonna.

369
00:28:16,225 --> 00:28:19,719
Scott: I'm gonna be double-checking though to make sure that it's a quality convention.

370
00:28:20,461 --> 00:28:22,951
Scott: You know, oh, yeah, I'm not helping them at all.

371
00:28:23,412 --> 00:28:23,633
Rym: Yep.

372
00:28:24,255 --> 00:28:27,008
Rym: I do see that Kinetic ons talking about doing something.

373
00:28:27,068 --> 00:28:28,757
Rym: they'd be pretty easy to work with packs.

374
00:28:28,797 --> 00:28:32,671
Rym: if they do something We'll definitely be willing to work with Kinetic ons canceled by the way.

375
00:28:32,933 --> 00:28:34,000
Rym: Yeah, ConnectiCon is canceled.

376
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,289
Rym: So there if anything there'll be an online ConnectiCon.

377
00:28:36,972 --> 00:28:38,719
Rym: so I guess we get right into the main bit.

378
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:41,250
Rym: then Don't think we have any other meta.

379
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:42,339
Rym: It's not like we're going anywhere.

380
00:28:45,122 --> 00:28:54,266
Rym: So computer maintenance I don't think we've ever actually talked about like the maintenance that is done on like our computers Nevermind like other electronics that we have.

381
00:28:54,648 --> 00:28:56,213
Scott: maybe we have and I forget.

382
00:28:56,935 --> 00:29:09,967
Rym: but the other thing I'm think I made me think about this when we were talking about what did the show on is that I Definitely have gotten the impression over much of my life that most people around me when they have computers Don't perform any maintenance on their computers at all.

383
00:29:10,489 --> 00:29:14,620
Rym: and the kinds of failures they have tend to be caused by that lack of maintenance.

384
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,406
Scott: Primarily, right?

385
00:29:16,447 --> 00:29:20,080
Scott: It's like, you know people have cars even people who are clueless and have cars.

386
00:29:20,663 --> 00:29:21,969
Scott: They do some amount of maintenance.

387
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,558
Scott: they change the oil, right?

388
00:29:23,779 --> 00:29:27,177
Rym: Yeah Granted they change the mile, you know, the oil says do it every 3,000 miles.

389
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:31,600
Rym: A lot of people think it's a scam and they do it every 6,000 miles or something.

390
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,163
Rym: It doesn't matter.

391
00:29:32,224 --> 00:29:35,040
Scott: the point is they do it right, but they don't do all of it.

392
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:39,418
Rym: They don't like get their transmission flushed when it's an old shitty car that probably needs that like.

393
00:29:39,438 --> 00:29:39,940
Rym: there's a lot of it.

394
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,505
Rym: But the point is to check.

395
00:29:41,565 --> 00:29:48,508
Scott: engine light turns on the you know, the tire pressure warning goes on People do something about it.

396
00:29:48,568 --> 00:29:50,076
Scott: They fuel the car, right?

397
00:29:50,096 --> 00:29:54,500
Scott: They clean the windows They do some small amount of unavoidable maintenance, right?

398
00:29:55,182 --> 00:30:03,998
Scott: If you have people who have computers It seems like a lot of people even smart people who are tech savvy ish Their equivalent of the check engine light on the computer will turn on.

399
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:11,320
Scott: Yeah But as long as the computer is working people will not do anything other than continue to use the computer in the way they want.

400
00:30:11,501 --> 00:30:19,140
Scott: Right, they will not like go about and do Maintenance tasks on the computer itself until the computer actually stops working.

401
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:21,940
Scott: That would be like if you didn't change your oil until the engine seized.

402
00:30:22,209 --> 00:30:35,499
Rym: Yep like these two late were like in your taskbar on a Windows PC like there's a warning because something isn't fully set up or you go Into device manager and like there's a USB device that's unrecognized but yet somehow you've been using for the last four years.

403
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:40,453
Scott: Yep, so they just don't do anything about now back in the olden days.

404
00:30:40,534 --> 00:30:44,566
Scott: You had to do more maintenance on Computers than you do nowadays.

405
00:30:44,586 --> 00:30:44,747
Rym: Yep.

406
00:30:44,827 --> 00:30:50,029
Rym: I mean I had to take my mouse apart like once every other week and clean You know your mouse ball.

407
00:30:50,069 --> 00:30:55,500
Scott: You had to defrag your hard drive All kinds of stuff you had to do back in the day.

408
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,927
Rym: I do my rotation of.

409
00:30:56,987 --> 00:30:59,540
Rym: what games do I uninstall and what games do I reinstall?

410
00:31:00,321 --> 00:31:01,739
Scott: Yeah, there's a lot of stuff you had to do.

411
00:31:01,841 --> 00:31:04,799
Scott: You don't have to do anymore But you still have to do a lot of stuff.

412
00:31:05,221 --> 00:31:06,706
Scott: Right your computer.

413
00:31:06,786 --> 00:31:10,940
Scott: no matter how well your case is designed and how good you've managed your pressure and your airflow.

414
00:31:11,622 --> 00:31:20,371
Scott: You got filters at least that are getting dusty and even if the cleanest house in the universe, it's getting dusty You have to clean out that dust right or your computer will overheat.

415
00:31:20,813 --> 00:31:22,980
Rym: So what I do is my case is positive pressure.

416
00:31:23,143 --> 00:31:32,650
Rym: I got two Crazy powerful intake fans in the front and I got an intake fan in the bottom and both of them pull through a filter Like each one just just a filter with magnets.

417
00:31:32,771 --> 00:31:33,777
Scott: I have the exact same thing.

418
00:31:33,937 --> 00:31:37,591
Rym: once a month I turn my computer off so the fans won't pull dust in.

419
00:31:37,611 --> 00:31:41,287
Rym: I pull those filters out and I wash them and then I put Back in my computer.

420
00:31:41,308 --> 00:31:42,820
Scott: I don't do it once a month.

421
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,840
Scott: I do it like once every few months, but I have a reminder to do it.

422
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,832
Rym: Well once a month I pull them out because they're not.

423
00:31:47,872 --> 00:31:49,180
Scott: dust is out of sight, right?

424
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,112
Scott: It's behind a plastic, you know lid right?

425
00:31:52,213 --> 00:31:52,976
Scott: So I would never know.

426
00:31:53,076 --> 00:31:53,900
Scott: I need that reminder.

427
00:31:53,961 --> 00:31:56,040
Scott: I'm like, you know my Google tasks.

428
00:31:56,261 --> 00:31:57,628
Rym: I check it once a month to see something.

429
00:31:57,648 --> 00:31:58,090
Rym: I don't reply.

430
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:00,020
Rym: don't clean them every month because sometimes I pull it out.

431
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:00,928
Rym: There's barely any dust.

432
00:32:00,948 --> 00:32:02,280
Rym: I just put it back in and wait another month.

433
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,650
Rym: But I will not name any names.

434
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:14,780
Rym: but I know multiple people who Basically said something to the effect of why would you put filters on your computer?

435
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,459
Rym: Won't they just get clogged and make your computer overheat?

436
00:32:19,421 --> 00:32:26,534
Scott: Okay, so that if you don't put the filter is the dust will come into the computer case and then you have to find old-style Maintenance that I used to do a clock.

437
00:32:26,836 --> 00:32:29,466
Scott: Yeah Inside the computer

438
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:44,960
Rym: every couple months me and Scott we take those expensive Air-dusters and we'd sit there and take our computers apart outside and blow a Terrifying amount of dust out of all the little cracks and all the little crannies and it was messy and disgusting and horrible.

439
00:32:45,688 --> 00:32:46,416
Scott: Yeah, it's no good.

440
00:32:48,161 --> 00:32:54,260
Scott: Yeah, so another thing you got to do with your computer maintenance wise is update stuff right up and honestly modern era.

441
00:32:54,360 --> 00:33:01,132
Scott: You've got to let all your software update all the time Right, so some people I think you know have stuff that auto updates right.

442
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:02,697
Scott: Chrome is auto updating you can't.

443
00:33:02,777 --> 00:33:03,500
Scott: it's hard to stop it.

444
00:33:03,621 --> 00:33:04,397
Scott: Yep, right.

445
00:33:05,761 --> 00:33:21,780
Scott: But some people try to avoid updates right and sometimes there's a good reason to avoid an update Right because you know about a specific thing that will break with your specific thing and you were paying attention So closely to the update news that you know that this updates gonna hurt your computer specifically

446
00:33:21,841 --> 00:33:22,204
Rym: Yep, like.

447
00:33:22,245 --> 00:33:23,113
Rym: I have an example of this.

448
00:33:23,153 --> 00:33:29,380
Rym: for a few years ago There was one like Nvidia driver update that broke civilization 5 for a brief time.

449
00:33:30,004 --> 00:33:32,059
Rym: Like if you've got this updates that 5 wouldn't work.

450
00:33:32,481 --> 00:33:36,236
Rym: I knew about it and I paused those updates and waited for a later update to come out.

451
00:33:36,276 --> 00:33:36,738
Rym: that fixed it.

452
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:42,794
Rym: but 90% of the time anyone who pauses or avoids updates is doing it for a bad reason.

453
00:33:43,356 --> 00:33:43,597
Scott: Yes.

454
00:33:43,737 --> 00:33:50,060
Scott: Those updates are Universe almost universally good right updates that will mess you up off it.

455
00:33:50,581 --> 00:33:56,500
Scott: Right now I've got the windows update the new one, you know the 2004 with you know, WSL 2 and everything.

456
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,266
Scott: I've got it updated on my work laptop.

457
00:33:58,306 --> 00:34:00,173
Scott: No problem on my PC.

458
00:34:00,293 --> 00:34:02,120
Scott: It says actually your PC's not ready.

459
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:05,931
Scott: We we've discovered, you know some incompatibilities.

460
00:34:05,951 --> 00:34:07,034
Scott: We're not gonna let you update.

461
00:34:07,234 --> 00:34:07,656
Scott: Yep, right?

462
00:34:07,676 --> 00:34:09,120
Scott: They've taken care of that for me.

463
00:34:09,261 --> 00:34:10,480
Scott: So I'm good, right?

464
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:13,087
Scott: It's like just push the update button on everything.

465
00:34:13,608 --> 00:34:20,652
Scott: right to make update your Nvidia driver update your computer Streamer like OBS has updates all the time.

466
00:34:20,732 --> 00:34:22,540
Rym: VLC has updates all the time.

467
00:34:22,781 --> 00:34:31,404
Rym: How many of you I've seen people at fucking anime cons start VLC and it pops up and says hey You're using a version from 1970.

468
00:34:31,404 --> 00:34:34,713
Rym: I think you want to upgrade and I watch them.

469
00:34:34,754 --> 00:34:35,135
Rym: Just click.

470
00:34:35,235 --> 00:34:37,000
Rym: Nope every time like what?

471
00:34:38,621 --> 00:34:39,885
Scott: Not only does clicking.

472
00:34:39,925 --> 00:34:44,275
Scott: Yes, right give you updated superior better software with new features.

473
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:45,540
Scott: That's just better in every way.

474
00:34:46,801 --> 00:34:49,429
Scott: It also stops that thing from popping up again for a while.

475
00:34:49,591 --> 00:34:58,646
Rym: Yep, right now the minor exception you might defer it update a little bit like if we're about to do GeekNights like a live stream and OBS has a brand new update.

476
00:34:58,686 --> 00:35:01,616
Rym: let them pops up right then right before we're about to do the show.

477
00:35:01,636 --> 00:35:04,106
Rym: I will say Remind me later.

478
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:06,900
Rym: I'm not gonna run the update right before I do something critical.

479
00:35:07,261 --> 00:35:11,519
Rym: I'll install the update when I have some time to you know, test whatever it is that might break.

480
00:35:12,081 --> 00:35:13,485
Scott: So after the GeekNights is uploaded.

481
00:35:13,545 --> 00:35:19,120
Rym: exactly but I do it like that night after the GeekNights is uploaded right update all software.

482
00:35:19,961 --> 00:35:27,072
Scott: Another thing you got to do is you got to keep looking around your computer every once in a while because like, you know Over time you just accumulate stuff.

483
00:35:27,253 --> 00:35:33,642
Rym: Yeah your computer like your desktop We'll probably have a folder that bit by bit a bunch of gifts you downloaded Right.

484
00:35:33,662 --> 00:35:39,965
Scott: You've got your downloads folder where it's just like filling up with all sorts of things you downloaded and it's like What is going on in there?

485
00:35:40,085 --> 00:35:42,994
Scott: It's like go in look around delete stuff.

486
00:35:43,014 --> 00:35:45,764
Scott: You don't need uninstall steam games You're not playing.

487
00:35:45,864 --> 00:35:49,060
Rym: I do this about every couple months like every two ish months.

488
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:52,400
Rym: What I'll do is I'll just basically I don't schedule it.

489
00:35:52,461 --> 00:36:00,339
Rym: I just sort of know it's time to do it But about every two months and I'll basically go into each one of my main volumes and I'll just look at the directory like alright What do I got set up in here?

490
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,772
Rym: like what's this drive for again?

491
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:06,339
Rym: and Then I'll just poke around and make sure that everything seems like it's where it needs to be.

492
00:36:06,842 --> 00:36:09,513
Rym: Is there like a directory that seems really big?

493
00:36:09,775 --> 00:36:10,799
Rym: that probably shouldn't be.

494
00:36:11,942 --> 00:36:15,740
Rym: If this was a server, I would automate a lot of that, but it's a desktop.

495
00:36:15,881 --> 00:36:17,849
Rym: It does not take me that long to do this automating.

496
00:36:17,869 --> 00:36:20,059
Rym: It would be harder than just looking at it every few months.

497
00:36:21,241 --> 00:36:33,285
Rym: But like when I ran servers I had scripts that would be like warned me if any directory Got more above like 10 gigabytes no matter where it was and then I would flat white list directories where I agree They should always be really big.

498
00:36:33,646 --> 00:36:44,259
Rym: so you know as soon as any random place in my computer gets too much stuff the server would Send me a notification saying yo you sure there should be 10 gigabytes of crap in like slash temp slash foo.

499
00:36:45,065 --> 00:36:46,760
Rym: Maybe you left some files there.

500
00:36:48,143 --> 00:36:49,930
Scott: Now you might say I got so much storage.

501
00:36:50,171 --> 00:36:51,356
Scott: right I'm loaded on storage.

502
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:52,300
Scott: It's so cheap these days.

503
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:52,802
Scott: I got money.

504
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:53,727
Scott: I got a lot of hard drives.

505
00:36:53,787 --> 00:36:54,149
Scott: Why do I?

506
00:36:54,189 --> 00:36:56,520
Scott: why should I be go around deleting files, right?

507
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,334
Scott: Well the number one reason is because you're part of your maintenance should be.

508
00:37:00,475 --> 00:37:01,680
Scott: obviously we've talked about this.

509
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,002
Scott: Backing up.

510
00:37:03,363 --> 00:37:04,065
Scott: yep, right.

511
00:37:04,447 --> 00:37:08,540
Scott: so the more crappy files you got lying around the more crappy files you back it up.

512
00:37:08,721 --> 00:37:14,800
Rym: Yeah, and if you're backing up like a gigantic temp directory That's just a waste of everyone's time and energy.

513
00:37:15,543 --> 00:37:19,860
Scott: Right so and part of your maintenance is gonna be testing that backup and restore system a little bit.

514
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,640
Scott: Yeah, right make sure your backup actually works.

515
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,416
Rym: Maybe once every I don't I don't do this as often as I should.

516
00:37:24,476 --> 00:37:31,819
Rym: every six months I pull down a Subset of my glacier backup of my NAS and make sure that the recovery process works.

517
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:36,390
Rym: mm-hmm Actually, that's coming up in Next month.

518
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:36,997
Rym: I got to do it again.

519
00:37:37,441 --> 00:37:38,264
Scott: Fine is if you're back.

520
00:37:38,304 --> 00:37:43,588
Scott: if you can't if you haven't tested to make sure your back your restore process works And your backups aren't backups.

521
00:37:43,649 --> 00:37:44,433
Scott: They're just bullshit.

522
00:37:44,574 --> 00:37:46,763
Scott: Yep now I'm not talking to know.

523
00:37:46,884 --> 00:37:53,986
Scott: if you if you don't know for a fact that you can actually take those backups and restore them then How do you know you're backed up?

524
00:37:54,167 --> 00:37:54,348
Scott: Yep?

525
00:37:54,488 --> 00:37:56,639
Rym: You might just be routing it all to dev null as far as you know.

526
00:37:57,401 --> 00:37:59,193
Scott: Yeah, it could be useless but part

527
00:37:59,214 --> 00:38:20,560
Rym: of that too is Reorganizing all my stuff because when you're using a computer especially in your anger in a hurry Oh, you're doing stuff I'll just kind of get around like you might be really quickly throwing together YouTube video for some reason and You download some images for it, and you just leave them in your downloads folder But then later you want to move them to the place with all the other assets for that video before you archive it.

528
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:37,308
Rym: So that's not the maintenance of testing backups or deleting unused files But that's the maintenance of all the places files will accumulate through normal use should either be purged or the things in those places should be moved to their real home so that you can maintain an Actual file and directory structure.

529
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:38,132
Rym: that is sensical.

530
00:38:38,413 --> 00:38:42,216
Rym: do not trust that you will remember Why you put something somewhere in the future.

531
00:38:42,277 --> 00:38:44,061
Rym: you will not Mm-hmm.

532
00:38:44,783 --> 00:38:46,287
Scott: so to go along with that right.

533
00:38:46,327 --> 00:38:52,590
Scott: not only your update in software right and you're organizing your data keeping it You know nice and clean right.

534
00:38:53,033 --> 00:38:55,305
Scott: you also got to keep your Configurations clean.

535
00:38:55,345 --> 00:38:55,927
Scott: a lot of people.

536
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:58,397
Scott: you install some software you configure it right.

537
00:38:58,417 --> 00:39:00,631
Scott: you set all the settings Which you should be doing anytime.

538
00:39:00,651 --> 00:39:05,799
Scott: you install a piece of software Set go through the settings and check all of them and make sure they're set the way you want.

539
00:39:06,801 --> 00:39:09,826
Scott: But when software gets updates settings change this.

540
00:39:09,846 --> 00:39:11,769
Scott: new settings old settings go away.

541
00:39:11,789 --> 00:39:14,903
Scott: Yeah, right and You know software.

542
00:39:14,964 --> 00:39:16,006
Scott: most software does it.

543
00:39:16,127 --> 00:39:20,980
Scott: it's best to you know translate your old settings into new settings that are comparable.

544
00:39:22,245 --> 00:39:24,454
Rym: Good at that compared to a lot of other things.

545
00:39:24,635 --> 00:39:25,760
Scott: all right, so you won't really notice.

546
00:39:25,921 --> 00:39:35,373
Scott: But you know you'd be surprised if you installed say Chrome like a year ago two years ago And you've been updating it and you hadn't checked the chrome settings.

547
00:39:35,574 --> 00:39:38,744
Scott: You should go in there, and you'll see like stuff You've never seen before.

548
00:39:38,784 --> 00:39:42,455
Scott: and all kinds of new biz right and it's like whoa you know.

549
00:39:42,495 --> 00:39:44,220
Scott: so you should be checking once in a while.

550
00:39:44,421 --> 00:39:53,180
Scott: You know you open an application you haven't used in a while right go check the settings on it See if there's anything new different updated right new features, whatever.

551
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:56,490
Rym: Yeah, right especially if it's software that you rely on.

552
00:39:56,751 --> 00:39:59,259
Rym: or is it particularly important to whatever it is that you do?

553
00:40:00,123 --> 00:40:02,580
Scott: Mm-hmm you know you might find like some feature.

554
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:08,077
Scott: It's like whoa I could have been having like increased performance because they add a GPU acceleration to this.

555
00:40:08,118 --> 00:40:09,846
Scott: three versions ago I just never update.

556
00:40:09,926 --> 00:40:10,892
Scott: I clicked on that option.

557
00:40:10,932 --> 00:40:11,717
Scott: it wasn't enabled.

558
00:40:11,777 --> 00:40:16,040
Rym: yep You know or I've seen a lot of podcasters in particular one.

559
00:40:16,362 --> 00:40:18,920
Rym: They won't really understand how Adobe creative thought updates work.

560
00:40:19,161 --> 00:40:24,120
Rym: So they'll have like three versions of audition installed because every like yearly update just gets installed.

561
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,340
Rym: But it leaves the old one there for pipeline testing.

562
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:34,680
Rym: But people just leave the old ones installed or sometimes get the new version But keep running the old version and then they don't know that the new features exist.

563
00:40:34,861 --> 00:40:40,169
Rym: And I see a lot of people especially in the podcasting space Asking questions like how do I remove reverb?

564
00:40:40,189 --> 00:40:43,500
Rym: and there's all these videos explaining how to remove reverb with these complicated filters.

565
00:40:43,981 --> 00:40:45,065
Rym: They don't seem to know that.

566
00:40:45,486 --> 00:40:55,047
Rym: audition added a feature called deep reverb that just works and is 99. it's better than what 99% of you would ever do on your own mm-hmm.

567
00:40:56,603 --> 00:41:01,772
Scott: something else right is That you know your computer over time right.

568
00:41:01,953 --> 00:41:02,515
Scott: you know it doesn't.

569
00:41:02,555 --> 00:41:05,626
Scott: it doesn't have a lot of moving parts Especially today with a lot of SSDs.

570
00:41:05,646 --> 00:41:08,275
Scott: you might know moving parts at all other than fans.

571
00:41:08,356 --> 00:41:20,099
Scott: Maybe not even fans But You know there is still no matter What is the law of entropy right things over time sort of are gonna fall apart slowly in some way right?

572
00:41:21,681 --> 00:41:23,749
Scott: So you just gotta you know check on things.

573
00:41:23,789 --> 00:41:26,500
Scott: go look at your CPU temperature once in a blue moon.

574
00:41:26,621 --> 00:41:28,932
Scott: You don't need a thing on your desktop like some overclocker.

575
00:41:28,972 --> 00:41:30,600
Scott: That's telling you the temperature all the time.

576
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:34,697
Scott: Yeah, right, but just take a look at it, and you know what if like over time.

577
00:41:34,757 --> 00:41:38,231
Scott: It's like oh It's a. it's a bit warmer than it used to be.

578
00:41:38,694 --> 00:41:40,000
Scott: go take a look at your fans.

579
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,987
Scott: See if they're spinning as well as they used.

580
00:41:42,007 --> 00:41:44,375
Scott: to make sure you know you're cooling.

581
00:41:44,415 --> 00:41:49,325
Scott: if you have a liquid cooling system that It's working as well as it used to it might need You know some attention.

582
00:41:49,365 --> 00:41:51,854
Scott: if it's super old and you've never done anything to it right.

583
00:41:51,934 --> 00:41:53,660
Scott: it might be a crummy one that you know.

584
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:55,035
Scott: It doesn't last that long right?

585
00:41:55,056 --> 00:41:59,680
Scott: it needs You know to be pressurized or I don't even know I've never had to do it because mine is a good one.

586
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,467
Scott: Yeah, but

587
00:42:00,507 --> 00:42:17,099
Rym: even though I have checked on it Fans will just die sometimes and The you don't want to be the person who just like the person being me in the past Shoves a nail into the side of their case to prevent the loud fan from spinning to deal with later because I left that nail I air for two years.

588
00:42:17,662 --> 00:42:20,796
Scott: It's like I haven't done any maintenance because I know I haven't had to do any.

589
00:42:20,816 --> 00:42:21,619
Scott: cuz I'm checking on it.

590
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:25,460
Scott: Yeah, right just once in a. you know it's like when you remember to write.

591
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,406
Scott: It's sort of like you know I have.

592
00:42:27,788 --> 00:42:28,450
Scott: this is unreal.

593
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:30,798
Scott: is maintenance of a non computer right, but I have.

594
00:42:30,838 --> 00:42:33,086
Scott: you know the Things I shaved my head with right.

595
00:42:33,106 --> 00:42:34,050
Scott: the clipper is the same one.

596
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:36,440
Scott: the barber has you know the big red one right?

597
00:42:36,861 --> 00:42:37,846
Scott: And you have to lubricate it.

598
00:42:37,927 --> 00:42:40,439
Scott: It's basically a little motor that just goes back and forth right.

599
00:42:41,521 --> 00:42:42,664
Scott: So it needs lubrication.

600
00:42:42,785 --> 00:42:44,489
Scott: and when should you lubricate it?

601
00:42:44,911 --> 00:42:48,942
Scott: whenever you remember to right because it's not something you remember to do Automatically.

602
00:42:48,982 --> 00:42:50,146
Scott: that often right.

603
00:42:50,247 --> 00:42:51,511
Scott: it's something you know.

604
00:42:51,551 --> 00:42:54,260
Scott: you remember once in a blue moon and once in a blue moon.

605
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,850
Scott: That's how often it needs to be lubricated.

606
00:42:55,891 --> 00:43:01,986
Rym: yeah, and for PCs There's a lot of maintenance like that as well like every now And then maybe even like only once a year.

607
00:43:02,226 --> 00:43:06,881
Rym: just even if you're like have filters and somehow your PC like it never gets dust into It.

608
00:43:07,222 --> 00:43:14,549
Rym: just open it up and just like look around in there and make sure nothing seems hinky Like or in particular with peripherals to like.

609
00:43:15,151 --> 00:43:15,894
Rym: everything's USB.

610
00:43:15,914 --> 00:43:17,219
Rym: now, and there's a lot of USB ports.

611
00:43:18,741 --> 00:43:24,460
Rym: Take a moment every few months just to make sure you know what all the things plugged into your computer are.

612
00:43:24,882 --> 00:43:29,422
Rym: You might have a bunch of USB cables go into nowhere Mm-hmm.

613
00:43:29,924 --> 00:43:38,878
Rym: I see that I see that kind of often especially people who do VR or who do a lot of live streaming or Who charge peripherals off of their computer for some reason?

614
00:43:40,787 --> 00:43:44,991
Scott: Hmm I don't know about you, but my computer has UPS attached to it.

615
00:43:45,031 --> 00:43:47,620
Scott: right the UPS battery is definitely something.

616
00:43:47,841 --> 00:43:51,619
Scott: Then any basically any battery at anything needs you know some sort of maintenance attention.

617
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:54,431
Scott: Yeah, right, but the UPS battery specifically.

618
00:43:54,451 --> 00:43:59,819
Scott: you got to keep an eye on that because you know I've had to replace the UPS battery once in my life right it?

619
00:44:00,302 --> 00:44:00,925
Scott: It was like well.

620
00:44:01,327 --> 00:44:03,760
Scott: I can't I don't have I'm not a good battery anymore.

621
00:44:03,821 --> 00:44:07,309
Scott: I won't keep your computer like well I guess I need a new battery then.

622
00:44:07,389 --> 00:44:08,797
Scott: so I got one and I swapped it in.

623
00:44:08,857 --> 00:44:09,380
Scott: it was good to go.

624
00:44:09,621 --> 00:44:15,064
Rym: Yep, I do not use the UPS stuff, but I've also never had a power outage in the entire time I've lived in New York.

625
00:44:15,769 --> 00:44:17,600
Scott: I also have it, but that's why I have a UPS.

626
00:44:18,802 --> 00:44:19,748
Scott: I'll be totally safe.

627
00:44:19,789 --> 00:44:20,957
Scott: what if it goes out right now?

628
00:44:21,581 --> 00:44:25,240
Scott: I can I can press save and audition and exit and then turn the computer off.

629
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:36,765
Rym: Yeah, but in terms of battery instead of losing a whole podcast and we're not talking about all technology But with computer peripherals if you have like a wireless mouse or something that doesn't charge like with its own intrinsic battery Even if like at least once a year.

630
00:44:36,805 --> 00:44:42,279
Rym: just like open it and just look inside and make sure nothing looks weird about those batteries.

631
00:44:42,861 --> 00:44:48,080
Rym: Batteries can keep working while leaking and you would not notice until it was way too late.

632
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:56,836
Scott: So double-a triple-a rechargeable style or non rechargeable alkaline You know nickel cadmium whatever kind of battery you got right.

633
00:44:56,876 --> 00:45:04,900
Scott: if it's that kind You know you don't want to leave those in us in the same device for a super long time and some devices won't wear out.

634
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:09,860
Rym: So you won't think to look like a wireless keyboard or especially like a computer television remote control.

635
00:45:10,322 --> 00:45:13,400
Rym: That battery might last five years with because it uses so little power.

636
00:45:14,201 --> 00:45:18,238
Scott: Right, but meanwhile, it's it's lasting five years, but if you open it and looked in there.

637
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:21,540
Scott: Oh, no It's all corroded and some acid got out, but it was working right.

638
00:45:22,561 --> 00:45:26,960
Scott: It's like yeah, you shouldn't leave the same batteries in the same thing or at least take them out.

639
00:45:27,301 --> 00:45:33,859
Scott: You know rub them a little bit make sure it's not crusty in there and put it back in right You know let it let it air out a little bit.

640
00:45:34,109 --> 00:45:35,123
Rym: Yep Now I did.

641
00:45:35,324 --> 00:45:39,438
Scott: I don't use other than for like you have a device you don't use like in forever.

642
00:45:39,499 --> 00:45:41,005
Scott: for example I like cameras on the show.

643
00:45:41,025 --> 00:45:41,788
Scott: take the batteries out.

644
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:43,114
Scott: take the batteries out.

645
00:45:43,155 --> 00:45:44,884
Scott: Don't leave batteries in something You're not using.

646
00:45:44,944 --> 00:45:53,924
Rym: I have a shelf or I put all my batteries both the special batteries that go in like my cameras and things and all the Anna loops and rechargeables and All the chemical cells.

647
00:45:53,965 --> 00:45:59,205
Rym: like I have a bunch of 9-volt batteries just for basically one purpose all the things I don't use.

648
00:45:59,789 --> 00:46:01,500
Scott: often the batteries are not in them.

649
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:12,824
Rym: They're in a separate place yep, but also if you have if you use rechargeable batteries like Anna loops in the equivalent Not so it because with the lithium-ion cell like you charge it right before you're gonna use it like if you know you're gonna use Your cameras.

650
00:46:13,065 --> 00:46:14,715
Rym: charge up all your batteries the day before.

651
00:46:14,775 --> 00:46:31,059
Rym: that can take a while but with the more like double-a triple-a cells the system I use I have one bin that holds them all and If they're faith the head if the plus is facing up it means that last I touched this box it was charged and any battery that goes back in there to be recharged later.

652
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:36,740
Rym: if Positive is facing down It means this battery is either not charged or I do not know if it is charged.

653
00:46:37,022 --> 00:46:42,600
Rym: I assume I would have to charge it before I put it in something Like a really really simple system.

654
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:51,859
Rym: Just like a lot of people do the thing with SD cards put it in facing out if there if it's free to use Put it in your little carrier facing in if there's even one file on it.

655
00:46:52,961 --> 00:46:53,804
Scott: Yeah, and you can also.

656
00:46:54,065 --> 00:46:58,420
Scott: SD cards also have these little lock unlock tabs on them that you can use to prevent writing.

657
00:46:58,501 --> 00:46:59,709
Scott: Yep, pretty useful.

658
00:47:00,272 --> 00:47:04,350
Rym: so keyboard mouse Mice don't really need maintenance anymore.

659
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:09,859
Rym: I found that mice tend to just break Long before there's anything you could clean or fix in them.

660
00:47:10,643 --> 00:47:14,471
Scott: however Much like game can game pads mice.

661
00:47:14,792 --> 00:47:26,493
Scott: often depending on the design of your mouse There will be sort of like seams in between the pieces of plastic and in those seams like, you know Oils and other gunk from your hands can sort of build up and create this.

662
00:47:26,874 --> 00:47:28,480
Scott: I don't know what you even call it like debris.

663
00:47:29,581 --> 00:47:36,500
Rym: So you want to brush that shit out of there before it gets like get a toothpick and or like some sort like some Sort of implement to pick that stuff out.

664
00:47:36,641 --> 00:47:44,400
Scott: I'll use what I'll use a lot of times is I'll just take a piece of paper And fold it in half and sort of slide it along just like a second to use like a scraper.

665
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:48,694
Scott: Yep, right just scrape out all the stuff in the grooves on game pads and mice.

666
00:47:48,975 --> 00:47:51,704
Rym: but but keyboards good lord I'm sorry boards guys.

667
00:47:52,026 --> 00:47:53,230
Rym: Good lord keyboards.

668
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:58,933
Scott: It's like people like get germophobia in the bathroom But it's like a keyboard is the dirtiest thing in the universe, right?

669
00:47:58,953 --> 00:48:00,460
Scott: It's like your hands are on it all the time.

670
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:01,503
Scott: How often do you clean it?

671
00:48:01,543 --> 00:48:02,968
Scott: basically never right?

672
00:48:02,988 --> 00:48:06,540
Scott: You're just rubbing your dirty hands on it constantly, right?

673
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:10,020
Scott: It's like oh you get it from your computer wash your hands you sit down you touch the keyboard again.

674
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:10,844
Scott: Yeah, what the hell did?

675
00:48:11,407 --> 00:48:11,970
Scott: what did you do?

676
00:48:12,373 --> 00:48:13,700
Scott: Why'd you even wash your hands, right?

677
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:21,608
Scott: So the thing with keyboards is that you know, there's this heat caps necessarily Have to have travel right?

678
00:48:21,628 --> 00:48:23,880
Scott: That's how they work their buttons that go up and down, right?

679
00:48:24,641 --> 00:48:26,489
Scott: And there has to be space between the keys.

680
00:48:26,549 --> 00:48:29,140
Scott: and even if you have some sort of chicklet keyboard, right?

681
00:48:29,421 --> 00:48:31,492
Scott: It's moving up and down and there's a space around it.

682
00:48:31,552 --> 00:48:33,763
Scott: stuff can get in those spaces Right.

683
00:48:34,085 --> 00:48:42,667
Scott: most keyboards which I imagine using with likes normal mechanical keys You know a typical desktop keyboard It's like there's a huge cavern underneath.

684
00:48:42,748 --> 00:48:47,304
Scott: all the keys or all sorts of filth can build up and that's in addition to all the grime On the key.

685
00:48:47,324 --> 00:48:54,420
Rym: Yep, but it's bad because a lot of cheap keyboards You can't remove the keys easily like you can easily break it or like they don't even come out on some crappy keyboards.

686
00:48:54,746 --> 00:49:06,082
Rym: but the keys No amount of shaking will get all the grime out because the grime will just fall into the top of the keys like little dirt Cups and then when you turn the keyboard back over, it'll fall right back down into the keyboard Right.

687
00:49:06,102 --> 00:49:11,040
Scott: So what you want to do is you want to once in a whenever right take all the keys off the keyboard.

688
00:49:11,383 --> 00:49:12,373
Scott: They can be put back on.

689
00:49:12,393 --> 00:49:30,589
Scott: it's not a big deal Right, then you can use like an air blaster or something to you know Clean out the underneath the key area and then for the keys themselves You can clean them individually with like some soap and water I guess, you know, or you or you can even put them in the dishwasher Depending on the design of your keyboard.

690
00:49:30,769 --> 00:49:32,920
Scott: You may be able to put the whole fucking thing in the dishwasher.

691
00:49:33,123 --> 00:49:33,651
Scott: I've done that.

692
00:49:33,671 --> 00:49:35,763
Rym: Be with Larry Expensive.

693
00:49:35,823 --> 00:49:38,660
Rym: nice keyboards tend to have a lot more options here, but cheaper keyboards.

694
00:49:38,701 --> 00:49:40,823
Rym: You might not have any options when in doubt.

695
00:49:40,884 --> 00:49:47,687
Rym: just shove that little red stick into the end of your air duster and just shove it under the keys and blow As much crap out as you can.

696
00:49:48,088 --> 00:49:49,092
Rym: you're not gonna get it all.

697
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:53,081
Rym: don't pretend you're gonna get it all but do something Now.

698
00:49:53,121 --> 00:49:56,010
Scott: another thing clean right is your monitors, right?

699
00:49:56,030 --> 00:49:57,113
Scott: So monitors get dusty.

700
00:49:57,373 --> 00:49:58,336
Scott: I don't care where you live.

701
00:49:58,396 --> 00:49:58,898
Scott: They're getting done.

702
00:49:58,918 --> 00:50:13,780
Rym: Yep, right Unless you have a monitor in like a clean room or something The clean rooms would actually like back when I work in clean rooms They would attract the tiny dust like the the bare minimal amount of dust that exists.

703
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:16,380
Scott: The one dust that was in the room would be attracted to the monitor.

704
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:18,869
Rym: Yep, because monitors will attract us for reasons.

705
00:50:18,889 --> 00:50:23,460
Rym: We don't want to get into but the magnetic fields will attract dust effectively.

706
00:50:24,384 --> 00:50:35,860
Scott: yeah, anyway, so What you got to do to clean your monitor right is you want to a obviously use some sort of non Abrasive cloth like a microfiber cloth, right so that you're not scratching your screen up, right?

707
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:39,234
Scott: And even though your screen might not have any large scratches on it.

708
00:50:39,415 --> 00:50:40,400
Scott: You're like, oh use paper towel.

709
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:41,063
Scott: No big deal.

710
00:50:41,424 --> 00:50:45,360
Scott: that paper towel might be making micro abrasions on the screen that you can't.

711
00:50:45,881 --> 00:50:53,928
Rym: Whenever I see someone use a paper towel on a screen unless it's a shitty old like screen that's on his last legs And you might not notice because it's just.

712
00:50:53,988 --> 00:50:57,820
Scott: they're so small like these tiny scratches that are smaller than like a human hair.

713
00:50:58,061 --> 00:51:01,292
Scott: Right, but those scratches over time build up and build up and build up.

714
00:51:01,372 --> 00:51:09,220
Scott: and then if you keep cleaning the screen with paper Towel or something frequently the screen is now blurry and you wouldn't notice if you look at the screen.

715
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:13,200
Scott: But if I put it next to a brand new screen of the same model, you'd be like, holy shit.

716
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:15,170
Scott: Why is that my screen all blurry and messed up?

717
00:51:15,231 --> 00:51:20,640
Scott: It's like as you've been taught you've been micro Scratching it right all for years with your paper towel.

718
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:25,900
Scott: So make sure you use a microfiber non abrasive cloth and you can just wipe to get dust off, right?

719
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:34,860
Scott: But what you would you can do If you want to do even better is you can either take some like rubbing alcohol and dilute it in a spray bottle of your own.

720
00:51:35,281 --> 00:51:38,291
Scott: Right, don't leave it at the whatever even though it's already pre diluted.

721
00:51:38,591 --> 00:51:39,474
Scott: No one sells 100% isopropyl alcohol.

722
00:51:39,494 --> 00:51:47,880
Scott: Yeah Well, you got to dilute it more right than what it is Yeah, and obviously your mileage may vary depending on the manufacturer.

723
00:51:48,040 --> 00:52:00,420
Rym: But the the real story is some cleaning chemicals in certain concentrations Depending on what the surface of your monitor is actually made of could destroy it or destroy components of it, right?

724
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:03,920
Scott: So you ought to make sure you're using the right stuff at the right dilution.

725
00:52:04,767 --> 00:52:18,900
Scott: One thing I've found, you know If you want to be extra safe, you can buy like glasses cleaning solution or camera lens cleaning solution Which is basically just pre diluted stuff, you know, but it's sort of like someone else did it for you.

726
00:52:19,021 --> 00:52:21,279
Scott: They put it in a spray bottle for you, right?

727
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:27,100
Scott: It's guaranteed to be good and safe and what you want to do with that stuff is spray it not on the screen.

728
00:52:27,381 --> 00:52:28,867
Scott: You spray it on the cloth.

729
00:52:28,887 --> 00:52:31,156
Scott: Yeah, and then you'll wipe the screen, right?

730
00:52:32,666 --> 00:52:33,840
Rym: Now here's an important point though.

731
00:52:33,941 --> 00:52:34,785
Scott: You can get it really nice and clean.

732
00:52:34,805 --> 00:52:37,460
Rym: You shouldn't need to use any cleaner on your screen.

733
00:52:37,682 --> 00:52:43,165
Rym: If you just wipe it down with a microfiber semi like pretty regularly Then the dust won't cake in.

734
00:52:43,245 --> 00:52:48,200
Rym: usually people spray it on the screen because there's that caked in dust that has settled.

735
00:52:48,302 --> 00:52:56,299
Scott: I won't solidify That is true, but I will often have to get out the spray if for example someone sneezes on the screen.

736
00:52:56,399 --> 00:52:58,002
Scott: Oh, yeah That's that.

737
00:52:58,063 --> 00:52:59,609
Scott: that's when the spray has to come out right?

738
00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:00,433
Scott: It's for the dust.

739
00:53:00,473 --> 00:53:01,960
Scott: you just the cloth is gonna get you there.

740
00:53:02,081 --> 00:53:04,598
Scott: It's for when something else accidentally gets on the screen.

741
00:53:04,618 --> 00:53:11,760
Rym: true That's when you need some help, but and I shouldn't need to say this don't touch your monitor if it's not a touch screen.

742
00:53:11,901 --> 00:53:12,764
Scott: Yeah, do not.

743
00:53:12,784 --> 00:53:16,500
Scott: Yeah, if it's not a touch screen do not touch the monitor if it is a touch screen.

744
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,930
Scott: For example, my iPhone or my iPad right?

745
00:53:19,251 --> 00:53:21,340
Scott: Those are made with like special glass, right?

746
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:24,232
Scott: Like my LCD monitors here are not made of glass.

747
00:53:24,273 --> 00:53:25,960
Scott: They're like the screen is plastic, right?

748
00:53:26,761 --> 00:53:27,865
Scott: So I really don't want to scratch it.

749
00:53:28,187 --> 00:53:29,231
Scott: the iPhone iPad.

750
00:53:29,291 --> 00:53:30,456
Scott: It's a glass screen.

751
00:53:30,516 --> 00:53:31,360
Scott: It's special glass.

752
00:53:31,922 --> 00:53:38,491
Scott: So even though you know, I've got hand oils all over it The way it's designed is like the microfiber alone.

753
00:53:38,531 --> 00:53:40,860
Scott: with no spray the oil will come off.

754
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,008
Scott: Yep, right and it will be perfectly clean.

755
00:53:43,148 --> 00:53:45,959
Scott: with microfiber only the oils get absorbed into the cloth.

756
00:53:47,621 --> 00:53:50,332
Scott: Also, you know replace your microfiber cloths once in a while.

757
00:53:50,372 --> 00:53:52,059
Scott: don't keep using the same one for a hundred years.

758
00:53:52,099 --> 00:53:53,525
Rym: Yep They cost like they're.

759
00:53:53,625 --> 00:53:53,806
Scott: they're.

760
00:53:54,227 --> 00:53:56,195
Scott: they're absorbing nasty shit right from.

761
00:53:56,255 --> 00:53:57,360
Scott: you're cleaning all this other stuff.

762
00:53:57,501 --> 00:53:59,535
Scott: So, you know get new ones once in a while Yep.

763
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:08,991
Rym: But seriously if short of like sneezing on it or spilling something if you just wipe the monitor down like once a week You probably won't ever have to spray anything on it short of an accident.

764
00:54:09,552 --> 00:54:10,375
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

765
00:54:11,979 --> 00:54:13,143
Rym: Oh What else we got?

766
00:54:13,163 --> 00:54:17,180
Rym: because luckily a lot of the things I would talk about do not need to be done anymore.

767
00:54:18,182 --> 00:54:20,699
Scott: Yeah, D fragmenting doesn't need to be done anymore.

768
00:54:21,982 --> 00:54:24,972
Scott: You know that's been solved by file systems and such.

769
00:54:25,233 --> 00:54:30,540
Scott: Yeah and hard drives that are so large And you know firmwares and things so it doesn't really matter.

770
00:54:31,822 --> 00:54:41,339
Rym: But it was a big thing back in the day Yep, and the other maintenance we could talk about are not computer specific and really out of bounds for a Monday cuz you know We're gonna need a Thursday show at some point.

771
00:54:42,365 --> 00:54:46,960
Scott: Yeah, probably Anyway, but yeah, that's the only idea we could come up with for our Monday show.

772
00:54:47,202 --> 00:54:51,231
Scott: I don't know how helpful that was because it was a lot of common sense To a lot of people.

773
00:54:51,474 --> 00:54:55,177
Rym: Yeah There's the last bit we can talk about what are.

774
00:54:55,197 --> 00:55:02,559
Rym: some day There's some things that I see certain people do and that I might have been guilty of doing when I was younger and fiddled a Lot more with my computer.

775
00:55:02,961 --> 00:55:06,852
Rym: but are there some maintenance things people are doing now that they shouldn't do?

776
00:55:06,972 --> 00:55:07,133
Rym: like?

777
00:55:07,534 --> 00:55:18,774
Rym: one example I have is the one thing that I Don't just automatically go update without doing any research is certain firmware Mmm, like I won't just update my camera to the newest firmware.

778
00:55:19,115 --> 00:55:29,960
Rym: every time firmware comes out I do check to see if there's a reason but that's because Updating firmware on a lot of devices is a moderately dangerous process where if it fails you can be in trouble.

779
00:55:30,583 --> 00:55:33,013
Scott: Yeah, so like your BIOS update if you went.

780
00:55:33,053 --> 00:55:36,118
Scott: if you if you want to install a BIOS update Right figure out what version you have.

781
00:55:36,448 --> 00:55:41,220
Scott: Yeah Figure out what version you're updating to and look at the change log and see.

782
00:55:41,762 --> 00:55:44,071
Scott: Do those any of those changes actually affect you?

783
00:55:44,412 --> 00:55:44,653
Scott: right?

784
00:55:45,135 --> 00:55:46,500
Scott: and then do the update?

785
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:47,162
Scott: It's not gonna.

786
00:55:47,242 --> 00:55:51,360
Scott: you know, if it's a software update like Photoshop is updating a video game is updating, right?

787
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:54,569
Scott: Yeah, checking is good, but you're just.

788
00:55:54,709 --> 00:55:55,552
Scott: you can just update.

789
00:55:55,612 --> 00:55:56,715
Scott: you can just update Firefox.

790
00:55:56,735 --> 00:55:57,838
Scott: you're pretty good right?

791
00:55:57,978 --> 00:56:01,804
Scott: Yeah a firmware update your BIOS EFI is updating.

792
00:56:02,265 --> 00:56:09,480
Scott: check on that if you don't need any of the things listed in the change log update if they don't affect you In any way, why are you updating?

793
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:21,240
Rym: Yep What I do is when I build a new computer or like if I'm doing a free install for whatever reason like just starting from scratch I'll get myself to the latest BIOS or you know, whatever firmware for all the different devices.

794
00:56:21,963 --> 00:56:30,235
Scott: But I won't really update it beyond that unless there's a specific reason to Because it might see it might seem sort of like hypocritical to be like update everything immediately.

795
00:56:30,255 --> 00:56:31,820
Scott: No, don't update be careful.

796
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:40,246
Scott: It's like if it's a firmware, right something like that that could risk bricking your device simply because of the firmware update process Which is still exceedingly rare.

797
00:56:40,306 --> 00:56:41,932
Scott: Don't be afraid to update a firmware.

798
00:56:42,313 --> 00:56:46,421
Rym: if there is an update that in the old days It used to be a lot dicier Like.

799
00:56:47,284 --> 00:56:51,497
Rym: I remember trying to operate the upgrade the firmware on individual hard drives to solve a problem.

800
00:56:51,537 --> 00:56:52,500
Rym: That was not a fun day.

801
00:56:53,283 --> 00:56:57,940
Scott: Yeah, it's like if you look there probably are like firmware updates for like your SSDs or something.

802
00:56:58,021 --> 00:56:59,873
Scott: But you don't odds are?

803
00:56:59,914 --> 00:57:00,518
Scott: you don't need them?

804
00:57:01,321 --> 00:57:09,880
Scott: Don't don't mess around unless you've already know you have a reason to auto up Right, and usually those sorts of things right won't be auto updated.

805
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:14,320
Scott: There'll be manual updates because they're only for people who need them who are seeking them out.

806
00:57:14,541 --> 00:57:19,275
Scott: The auto updates if it's an auto update it's like yeah, that's because everyone.

807
00:57:19,596 --> 00:57:20,680
Scott: it's appropriate for everybody.

808
00:57:21,524 --> 00:57:30,372
Rym: yeah, the other thing I used to do is Butts with my BIOS and try to tweak the performance of my PC based on benchmarks.

809
00:57:30,693 --> 00:57:38,889
Rym: I used to do that semi-regularly and I Think the error where that matters is long Past.

810
00:57:39,010 --> 00:57:40,120
Rym: it's not like the old days.

811
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:49,255
Rym: We've talked about this gig guys before where you can buy an 800 megahertz CPU and by futzing with it You can over time tune it and get it to like 1.1 gigahertz.

812
00:57:49,476 --> 00:57:50,300
Rym: That's a huge.

813
00:57:50,641 --> 00:57:51,908
Scott: Overclocking is a hobby.

814
00:57:51,929 --> 00:57:53,014
Scott: It is not maintenance.

815
00:57:53,698 --> 00:57:55,847
Scott: Yeah It's expensive hobby too.

816
00:57:56,027 --> 00:58:02,043
Scott: However, one thing I do see other people doing that they shouldn't do is Like maintenance.

817
00:58:02,083 --> 00:58:11,523
Scott: that they're doing that they don't need to do is on their phones on their iPads on their even on their computers is Closing applications Unnecessarily.

818
00:58:11,744 --> 00:58:14,280
Rym: Oh my god, like oh chrome is using so much RAM.

819
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:19,460
Rym: I gotta like close everything and reboot like no, it's just cached like the whole point of RAM.

820
00:58:19,601 --> 00:58:21,239
Rym: Is it's just caching stuff that you might need?

821
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:23,224
Scott: Yeah, it's like you're good.

822
00:58:23,345 --> 00:58:27,760
Scott: Don't close things to you know for the sake of closing them, right?

823
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:32,280
Scott: It's like it's okay to leave things open if your computer hasn't people like oh, it's using a hundred.

824
00:58:32,501 --> 00:58:35,033
Scott: You know, it's using a gig 10 gigabytes of RAM.

825
00:58:35,074 --> 00:58:35,918
Scott: How much RAM do you have?

826
00:58:35,918 --> 00:58:36,741
Scott: 32?

827
00:58:36,741 --> 00:58:38,166
Scott: So that means you've got 12 free.

828
00:58:38,568 --> 00:58:40,193
Scott: It's like our 22 free.

829
00:58:40,374 --> 00:58:41,076
Scott: It's like well, yeah.

830
00:58:41,197 --> 00:58:42,080
Scott: Well, then what's the problem?

831
00:58:43,341 --> 00:58:51,940
Scott: Right if your RAM is not full It's not a problem and the way phones work is all those applications that like you're swiping away to make completely closed.

832
00:58:52,481 --> 00:58:52,782
Scott: Right.

833
00:58:53,203 --> 00:58:55,490
Scott: and you know, it's like those are hibernating.

834
00:58:55,530 --> 00:58:56,894
Scott: They were like on your right.

835
00:58:56,934 --> 00:58:58,940
Scott: those weren't in your RAM on your phone.

836
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,647
Rym: Yeah, right like at a Windows PC.

837
00:59:00,667 --> 00:59:02,775
Rym: You got a swap file and like stuff.

838
00:59:02,796 --> 00:59:03,880
Rym: You're not even looking at.

839
00:59:04,021 --> 00:59:08,990
Scott: Just get moved over there hanging out And if your swap file gets hit your computer needs more RAM.

840
00:59:09,311 --> 00:59:11,077
Scott: Yeah, you don't need to close applications.

841
00:59:11,097 --> 00:59:11,679
Scott: You need more RAM.

842
00:59:12,522 --> 00:59:31,779
Scott: Like for example on an iPhone if I open one app a game and then I switch to another app what the iPhone does is It takes a screenshot of what that game looked like when I when I put it in the background and then it takes the RAM From that game and it's gonna put it like not in the RAM But like and you know some solid-state storage or somewhere else.

843
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:32,642
Scott: Right.

844
00:59:33,224 --> 00:59:40,630
Scott: and then if I switch back to that game what the iOS does is it shows me the Screenshot of the game as it was when I closed it.

845
00:59:41,213 --> 00:59:52,651
Scott: and while I'm looking at that screenshot It's moving the that game back into RAM and then it starts again exactly as it was when I left it Right, so there's no if you swipe it away.

846
00:59:52,832 --> 01:00:00,840
Scott: What you're doing is you're basically Removing that saved state of the software you were using and that's a good thing to do.

847
01:00:01,101 --> 01:00:11,140
Scott: If the app is messed up and you need to like get it to relaunch from nothing again Yeah, right because there's a problem, but there's no reason to just go doing it to apps that are working perfectly fine.

848
01:00:11,241 --> 01:00:15,324
Scott: It's not gonna help your phone or change it in any way It's not.

849
01:00:15,565 --> 01:00:24,620
Scott: it's just gonna make your experience actually worse because now every time you open apps They're gonna start from nothing instead of starting from where they left off and being more convenient.

850
01:00:24,781 --> 01:00:25,583
Rym: Yep, well, I gave it.

851
01:00:25,603 --> 01:00:26,687
Rym: now I got Chrome open.

852
01:00:26,848 --> 01:00:28,995
Rym: Chrome's using about two gigabytes of RAM.

853
01:00:29,557 --> 01:00:30,280
Rym: who cares?

854
01:00:31,201 --> 01:00:36,620
Rym: Yep, I've got twelve point eight gigabytes in use and I've the rest is available.

855
01:00:37,761 --> 01:00:40,027
Scott: My Firefox is using one and a half gigs.

856
01:00:40,388 --> 01:00:42,333
Scott: Oh, no, maybe like three.

857
01:00:42,353 --> 01:00:43,476
Scott: Oh, it's using a lot.

858
01:00:43,517 --> 01:00:48,893
Scott: It's got several processes Discords using seven to eight hundred megs.

859
01:00:48,954 --> 01:00:49,576
Scott: Who cares?

860
01:00:49,817 --> 01:00:52,405
Scott: Yep, right Not a big deal.

861
01:00:52,606 --> 01:00:55,900
Rym: Yeah, I've seen people to sit there in task manager like killing stuff.

862
01:00:56,642 --> 01:01:01,840
Rym: We're past the days of hold f5 to boot raw and that or like use a boot disk to make a game work.

863
01:01:02,489 --> 01:01:11,403
Scott: What you should do However is if you notice your computer being slow and you look in task manager and you see some processes that you don't recognize You should google them.

864
