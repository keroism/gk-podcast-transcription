00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,951
Rym: It's Tuesday December 15th 2020.

2
00:00:11,951 --> 00:00:14,959
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:14,979 --> 00:00:19,620
Rym: tonight We are talking about the fantastic hypno space outlaw.

4
00:00:21,883 --> 00:00:27,611
Scott: Let's do this All right, so you know these days stuck inside.

5
00:00:27,992 --> 00:00:28,794
Scott: It's getting colder.

6
00:00:29,035 --> 00:00:32,265
Scott: I'm like double stuck inside I guess like yeah like.

7
00:00:32,345 --> 00:00:39,227
Rym: I got one last hike in this weekend because it was weirdly warm on Sunday like Mercishly warm, and I feel like that's one.

8
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:40,973
Scott: Yeah, it's like it used to be.

9
00:00:41,093 --> 00:00:43,400
Scott: well try not to go outside, but it's warm.

10
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,550
Scott: I'm gonna go outside if I can kinda right now.

11
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:48,938
Scott: It's like I don't even want to go outside.

12
00:00:48,978 --> 00:00:49,379
Scott: It's gold.

13
00:00:51,821 --> 00:00:52,744
Scott: So I've been.

14
00:00:52,804 --> 00:01:07,880
Scott: you know all the stuff that you have lying around your nerdy house those nerdy things that you never get around to Like the old Apple computers you bought or acquired somehow in the late 90s And then have just carried around with you and kept in the closet and never used.

15
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,846
Scott: It's like huh well.

16
00:01:08,866 --> 00:01:10,013
Scott: Let's have fun with those.

17
00:01:10,114 --> 00:01:11,080
Scott: right we like computers.

18
00:01:13,242 --> 00:01:14,911
Scott: So I managed to get all sorts of.

19
00:01:15,112 --> 00:01:26,428
Scott: you know there are all sorts of new things Available that weren't available a long time ago to make these old computers easier to use right like things to adapt MicroSD cards to speak to.

20
00:01:26,448 --> 00:01:30,079
Scott: you know old Apple floppy interfaces and things like that.

21
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:35,360
Rym: yeah I remember how trouble it was to mess with those Apple things like back at RIT when you were messing with them.

22
00:01:36,182 --> 00:01:39,912
Scott: Yep, so the Apple to GS is actually doing great.

23
00:01:40,413 --> 00:01:42,900
Scott: the memory expansion card that it already had and it works.

24
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,746
Scott: It has one megabyte of RAM.

25
00:01:45,167 --> 00:01:47,053
Scott: It seems that all of its parts work.

26
00:01:47,354 --> 00:01:49,220
Scott: The screen is actually pretty unbelievable.

27
00:01:49,601 --> 00:01:51,707
Scott: It works super well, and the image is super clear.

28
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:56,560
Scott: that old crazy RGB monitor stuff like a special thing is not VGA.

29
00:01:58,001 --> 00:01:59,889
Scott: So yeah, everything's good in that department.

30
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:02,339
Scott: Just the keyboards not you know the most fun to type on.

31
00:02:03,961 --> 00:02:07,313
Scott: The Mac Plus has like is like an up-and-down right.

32
00:02:07,775 --> 00:02:11,326
Scott: so the Mac Plus is like You know is an old Mac.

33
00:02:11,367 --> 00:02:15,419
Scott: the kind that you know was at the built-in monitor right with the floppy under it, right?

34
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:17,674
Scott: And it totally works.

35
00:02:19,141 --> 00:02:22,555
Scott: Not don't need to mess with the floppy drive because like I said I got other tools to.

36
00:02:22,635 --> 00:02:23,680
Scott: you know avoid that.

37
00:02:23,862 --> 00:02:26,886
Scott: I'm pretty sure it'd be broken anyway And I don't have any floppies that will work in it.

38
00:02:27,027 --> 00:02:31,044
Scott: to begin with the screen is actually kind of got an unbelievably clear Image.

39
00:02:31,085 --> 00:02:36,389
Scott: it's working so well and The mouse works right.

40
00:02:36,429 --> 00:02:40,469
Scott: oh the the Apple to GS problem Is that the have a mouse for it.

41
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:42,560
Scott: that works, but it doesn't have a ball.

42
00:02:42,721 --> 00:02:44,214
Scott: So I'm like sticking my fingers in the.

43
00:02:44,435 --> 00:02:48,353
Rym: oh no That is that is so work optimal.

44
00:02:48,895 --> 00:02:51,266
Scott: I'm working on solving that one Egg and then get the ball out of there.

45
00:02:51,286 --> 00:02:57,543
Scott: yeah the So on.

46
00:02:57,563 --> 00:02:59,150
Rym: so fun fact if you open that thing up.

47
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,074
Rym: You know how that thing works.

48
00:03:00,315 --> 00:03:04,432
Rym: It's actually an optical mouse Mmm.

49
00:03:04,734 --> 00:03:05,680
Rym: Those rollers are not.

50
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,129
Rym: what do you think those rollers are doing?

51
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:08,252
Rym: Let me make sure.

52
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:10,706
Scott: the Apple mouse spinning a piece of metal with a gear.

53
00:03:10,726 --> 00:03:18,870
Rym: no Well it is, but that piece of metal is spinning a wheel that has markings on it, and there's probably a light in there.

54
00:03:20,111 --> 00:03:20,311
Scott: That's.

55
00:03:20,452 --> 00:03:21,837
Scott: I haven't opened the mouse to find out.

56
00:03:21,857 --> 00:03:25,790
Rym: I'll check if the Apple to mouse was actually that this is like a third-party mouse.

57
00:03:26,251 --> 00:03:27,154
Rym: Oh, so you don't have the original.

58
00:03:27,837 --> 00:03:32,313
Rym: yeah most mice from that era were technically optical mice because that was the only way to make it Accurate.

59
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:33,340
Rym: you'd have like computers 1986.

60
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:38,375
Scott: yeah anyway The point is the Mac plus.

61
00:03:38,476 --> 00:03:41,927
Scott: I upgraded it from one megabyte of RAM to four megabytes.

62
00:03:41,967 --> 00:03:48,474
Scott: in order to do that I had to take out the motherboard right swap for swap for Sims.

63
00:03:48,514 --> 00:03:51,125
Scott: I guess I didn't even know if they're dims or whatever they're.

64
00:03:51,225 --> 00:03:52,410
Scott: you know memory sticks, right?

65
00:03:52,991 --> 00:03:54,137
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

66
00:03:54,197 --> 00:03:54,941
Scott: I don't know what they are.

67
00:03:55,223 --> 00:03:56,187
Scott: I bought them on the internet.

68
00:03:56,228 --> 00:03:56,549
Scott: They worked.

69
00:03:57,613 --> 00:03:58,138
Scott: They were cheap.

70
00:03:58,158 --> 00:03:59,148
Scott: They were like a couple bucks.

71
00:04:00,631 --> 00:04:07,941
Scott: But I also there was a resistor on the motherboard and if the resistor is in the computer Thinks the memory chips are small.

72
00:04:07,962 --> 00:04:09,430
Scott: so I had to remove the resistor.

73
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:13,990
Scott: So I basically unsoldered one of the two halves of the resistor and pulled it out.

74
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:17,070
Scott: So it's still stuck in there, but you know it's not it's not connecting.

75
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,225
Scott: So that way if you ever want to put it back in right you can.

76
00:04:20,265 --> 00:04:21,029
Scott: it's still sitting there.

77
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,133
Scott: Then right.

78
00:04:23,173 --> 00:04:23,896
Scott: so in the back.

79
00:04:23,956 --> 00:04:27,910
Scott: I have this thing that you know converts from SCSI to micro SD.

80
00:04:28,991 --> 00:04:34,350
Scott: The problem is is that the Mac plus does not provide what is known as SCSI termination power.

81
00:04:34,872 --> 00:04:40,659
Scott: So I don't know how many people know, but SCSI the old SCSI interface To my RIT computer.

82
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:43,813
Scott: right it was used by mostly PCs.

83
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:50,310
Rym: I mean mostly by Macs, but also some PCs and PC anything like ultra high-performance extremely expensive option.

84
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:50,671
Rym: Right

85
00:04:51,073 --> 00:05:12,098
Scott: you could use it for printers hard drives various other devices And the way it worked is you could actually daisy chain Several devices together so you have one SCSI port and you could plug cable a to device one And then you connect from the back of device one to the back of device two and then from the back of that device to Your printer to the back of another right and so on.

86
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,457
Scott: and as you set this little dials on the back of all the devices So you choose which number they are.

87
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:29,003
Scott: so this is device one two three four five six however many you can support And then all these devices will be able to communicate with the computer Even though at the end of the day all of those signals are going over.

88
00:05:29,304 --> 00:05:30,007
Scott: What's basically?

89
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:34,975
Scott: one cable Right it's a lot of pins on Inside.

90
00:05:35,015 --> 00:05:40,589
Rym: there's a bunch of like parallel nonsense And I used to remember I used to know intimately all the details about SCSI work.

91
00:05:40,911 --> 00:05:45,989
Scott: But yeah this one only has 15 pins actually, but it's still the same functionality is still there.

92
00:05:47,054 --> 00:05:57,638
Scott: So like you know if your printers if you have three hard drives in a printer when you print Right those electrical signals go all the way down all the hard drive cables and back and the hard drives are doing stuff at the same time.

93
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,150
Scott: right anyway.

94
00:05:59,173 --> 00:06:01,516
Scott: so Scuzzy termination power.

95
00:06:01,556 --> 00:06:03,303
Scott: there was some electrical phenomenon.

96
00:06:03,343 --> 00:06:13,730
Scott: I don't fully understand it, but well the way It's been described is that The signals would like bounce off the end of the chain, and you would get sort of like an echo off the end.

97
00:06:15,172 --> 00:06:23,690
Scott: So there needed to be some sort of termination right to prevent that echo from Bouncing off the end of the chain of cables and like messing up all the data.

98
00:06:25,133 --> 00:06:32,186
Scott: So some devices would provide termination power and some would not right.

99
00:06:32,728 --> 00:06:37,289
Scott: so If for example you know you have a Mac plus here the Mac plus does not provide it.

100
00:06:38,052 --> 00:06:46,443
Scott: So that means that like you plug a hard drive in that hard drive has to sort of do it itself Right to be have a terminator at the end of some kind otherwise it would just wouldn't work.

101
00:06:47,185 --> 00:06:56,050
Scott: so this little device Obviously you can plug in a USB cable to it to provide that power you know to get the termination.

102
00:06:56,592 --> 00:07:06,688
Scott: But it would be much nicer if you could just stick this in the back of a Mac plus and be good to go right With no having not having to go get your micro USB cable and another power outlet or whatever a battery or something right.

103
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:07,029
Scott: yeah.

104
00:07:08,453 --> 00:07:13,602
Scott: So in order to there happens to be Right the Mac plus if you take the motherboard out.

105
00:07:13,682 --> 00:07:20,169
Scott: right next to the SCSI connector in the back There are these two holes where it looks like something should go and nothing's there.

106
00:07:21,033 --> 00:07:22,157
Scott: And it just so happens.

107
00:07:22,217 --> 00:07:28,390
Scott: if you take a diode and put it in that spot Then suddenly you'll have SCSI termination power.

108
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:32,550
Scott: They added this feature to the Mac plus and never enabled it with a single dial.

109
00:07:32,651 --> 00:07:34,530
Scott: They could just put one diode in every Mac plus.

110
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:34,972
Scott: They didn't.

111
00:07:35,735 --> 00:07:39,450
Scott: and back in the day this Mac plus cost like a fortune right to buy one new.

112
00:07:40,152 --> 00:07:42,221
Scott: You know they couldn't add one diode to it's like.

113
00:07:42,241 --> 00:07:42,623
Scott: come on.

114
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:46,051
Scott: I bought 50 diodes for like $2.

115
00:07:46,051 --> 00:07:46,373
Scott: I'm not.

116
00:07:46,473 --> 00:07:50,650
Scott: I'm sure they were more expensive in 1986 whatever, but not that expensive.

117
00:07:52,391 --> 00:07:53,034
Scott: So I did that.

118
00:07:53,075 --> 00:07:53,617
Scott: that worked.

119
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,350
Scott: the memory upgrade worked everything worked.

120
00:07:56,712 --> 00:07:57,436
Scott: It was so great.

121
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:00,593
Scott: this Mac plus is running like Quite.

122
00:08:00,633 --> 00:08:11,790
Scott: amazingly and also quite amazing that you can get the Mac plus to run Mac OS like 75 which came out and like you know the like which is like many many years newer than the computer itself.

123
00:08:11,931 --> 00:08:15,629
Scott: It really makes me think about how old iPhones run the newest iOS.

124
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:21,590
Scott: So it's sort of the same thing like the super old Mac would run like a Mac OS that came out so many years afterwards.

125
00:08:23,133 --> 00:08:25,589
Scott: The problem is the keyboards not work.

126
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:29,950
Scott: I don't know why the keyboards not working.

127
00:08:30,171 --> 00:08:33,970
Scott: I don't remember if it was broken before or after I did all this stuff.

128
00:08:34,054 --> 00:08:38,530
Rym: Oh, no That's the worst because if you knew they know it worked at some point then it's a different calculus.

129
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:39,914
Scott: Then did it work right.

130
00:08:40,095 --> 00:08:40,797
Scott: so I took my.

131
00:08:40,998 --> 00:08:42,624
Scott: I took my meter my multimeter.

132
00:08:42,664 --> 00:08:47,338
Scott: luckily if you take the if you open up The keyboard case this it is easy access.

133
00:08:47,358 --> 00:08:58,380
Scott: because though the keyboard connects to the Mac plus with like old Telephone rj10 right and it's only four wires Five volt ground clock and data, that's it.

134
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,948
Scott: four wires for the keyboard on an rj10.

135
00:09:02,731 --> 00:09:08,370
Scott: So the problem is is that there's basically no other keyboards in the world that like do rj10 except this one stupid keyboard for the Mac.

136
00:09:08,997 --> 00:09:09,646
Scott: That's the only one.

137
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:19,159
Scott: There's a lot of adapters out there where that will let you use this old rj10 keyboard with Another interface.

138
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,170
Scott: it's like on a. you could use it on a newer computer.

139
00:09:21,713 --> 00:09:26,492
Scott: There aren't a lot out there to use a ps2 Keyboard.

140
00:09:26,512 --> 00:09:32,044
Scott: you have to like make something with an Arduino in order to use like a ps2 keyboard and convert it to use the rj10.

141
00:09:33,771 --> 00:09:35,558
Scott: It's also not standard rj10.

142
00:09:35,578 --> 00:09:36,983
Scott: You can't just grab a phone cable.

143
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:38,930
Scott: I think the wires don't line up straight.

144
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,613
Scott: They think they're.

145
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:40,839
Scott: you know, they're.

146
00:09:41,382 --> 00:09:43,472
Scott: the pin outs are different on either end I forget.

147
00:09:44,075 --> 00:09:47,110
Scott: but anyway, I tested the pin outs and everything seemed right.

148
00:09:47,672 --> 00:09:49,377
Scott: So I'm thinking the keyboard might be broken.

149
00:09:49,437 --> 00:09:53,290
Scott: but getting a new keyboard for this is actually not the cheapest.

150
00:09:54,891 --> 00:10:05,205
Scott: So it's kind of sad that like I upgraded this Mac plus all the way and like without a keyboard it It's kind of sad, but once it works we can play Carmen Sandiego or some shit.

151
00:10:05,607 --> 00:10:07,354
Rym: Ah, yeah the fellows We can't even do like.

152
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:07,514
Rym: like.

153
00:10:07,715 --> 00:10:12,280
Rym: we could set up a show where we like fuck with it and do something semi-live But we can't even like media.

154
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,307
Rym: I can't go play with this thing.

155
00:10:14,012 --> 00:10:16,322
Scott: No, what's really sad is like you just open up an emulator.

156
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:17,809
Scott: it just works better and way faster.

157
00:10:20,112 --> 00:10:21,850
Scott: Emulator is just better in every way this.

158
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:27,270
Scott: How much reason is there to actually use the old computer versus the emulator?

159
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:36,819
Rym: Yeah I guess the only reason to use the old computers for the aesthetic of having the hardware there or if you're doing some sort of Hardware verification of some behavior that's different.

160
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:39,346
Scott: Yeah, something like that or like.

161
00:10:39,526 --> 00:10:40,930
Scott: I actually set a virtual box.

162
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:47,169
Scott: I installed Windows 3.1 in VirtualBox and It's just way better than having a DOS PC.

163
00:10:49,101 --> 00:10:56,190
Rym: I don't need to go buy a 486 Alright, so there's a lot of gaming news like a ton and we're not gonna talk about everything.

164
00:10:56,652 --> 00:11:02,143
Scott: It's been so long since we did a Tuesday show and it feels like there was so much gaming news But I can't remember anything that happened before today.

165
00:11:02,163 --> 00:11:06,085
Rym: So let's just talk about what happened today Yep, or things that happened recently and there's a cluster.

166
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:06,930
Rym: There's like three story.

167
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:14,173
Rym: Well, there's really like five stories, but I want to condense them all into issues around cyberpunk 2077 Right.

168
00:11:14,213 --> 00:11:21,640
Scott: So I gotta start with saying that like this game was announced and it was like such a huge announcement People were so hype over it, but I'm like, wait a minute.

169
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,570
Scott: This is based on cyberpunk 2020 the tabletop RPG.

170
00:11:24,811 --> 00:11:30,068
Scott: I thought that was like an obscure thing that only tabletop RPG people and like netrunner players knew about.

171
00:11:30,088 --> 00:11:30,790
Scott: you are correct.

172
00:11:31,811 --> 00:11:33,756
Scott: The original Android netrunner was.

173
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:43,857
Scott: I mean Android netrunner was based on the original netrunner and the original netrunner used the intellectual property from the Cyberpunk 2020 RPG.

174
00:11:43,877 --> 00:11:45,182
Scott: right, but I don't.

175
00:11:45,322 --> 00:11:47,410
Scott: actually I actually don't know people who've played it.

176
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,474
Scott: It's like people know of it.

177
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:51,244
Scott: But like if people have played it, they don't talk about.

178
00:11:51,264 --> 00:11:56,130
Rym: I mean the only cyber punky RPG I ever played was second edition shadow run and that is a shadow run.

179
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:57,273
Scott: I've heard of people playing.

180
00:11:57,353 --> 00:11:57,473
Scott: I'm.

181
00:11:57,534 --> 00:12:03,690
Scott: cyberpunk is like a thing people know of every art tabletop RPG people know about but people didn't play.

182
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:20,837
Scott: Right, you know, yep, but so I was very surprised to see that the cyber the the to my knowledge first ever video game based on this property was like triple a mega game of like Untold proportions.

183
00:12:20,937 --> 00:12:24,390
Rym: I mean, I honestly didn't even think about it as being based on that property.

184
00:12:24,471 --> 00:12:26,590
Rym: Not like that didn't even cross my mind.

185
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:32,930
Rym: All I thought was cyberpunk is a very generic term for a particular kind of cyberpunk is a very generic term.

186
00:12:33,031 --> 00:12:50,230
Scott: but to my knowledge the only thing that like titles itself as like Cyberpunk the game is that like I'm pretty sure if you tried to make another game called Some cyberpunk like that was the name of your game that like art alsorian would come after you with the trademark lawsuit or whatever.

187
00:12:50,431 --> 00:12:53,530
Scott: I mean that especially if you did cyberpunk followed by a year, right?

188
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,563
Scott: Cuz the original was 20/20 and this one's 27/7, right?

189
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,437
Rym: I just want to point out that that is the.

190
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:01,089
Rym: the Wikipedia page for this game does not mention this at any point.

191
00:13:02,055 --> 00:13:04,758
Scott: Okay, interesting But I'll be that it's not.

192
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:06,687
Rym: what you miss is that it wouldn't have mattered.

193
00:13:06,728 --> 00:13:12,130
Rym: either way The hype machine for this game was running at possibly the maximum.

194
00:13:12,311 --> 00:13:18,230
Rym: I've seen a triple-a video game studio run since like the era of giant ARGs.

195
00:13:19,051 --> 00:13:19,733
Scott: Yeah, I've seen.

196
00:13:19,753 --> 00:13:31,950
Scott: you know, we've seen big games get big hype but like like Yana Reeves doing the stuff like this game Pulled out all the stops, but also this game was on it's on every platform.

197
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:35,752
Rym: Well, there's a big asterisk next to that now Right.

198
00:13:35,792 --> 00:13:36,355
Scott: Well, it's on it's.

199
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:37,400
Scott: you know, it wasn't just.

200
00:13:37,601 --> 00:13:38,546
Scott: it wasn't an exclusive.

201
00:13:38,586 --> 00:13:39,873
Scott: I don't think it's on switch Is it?

202
00:13:39,954 --> 00:13:42,110
Scott: I don't think so, but it's on PC xbox.

203
00:13:42,734 --> 00:13:47,759
Rym: Better on the switch than it seems to run on the ps4 Maybe but the point is it's on like everything right?

204
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:51,130
Scott: So they're trying to get as many people to buy this game as possible.

205
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,528
Scott: It's not some exclusive, right?

206
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:56,055
Scott: So yeah huge huge deal.

207
00:13:56,537 --> 00:13:58,884
Scott: then there was while it was being developed.

208
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:00,870
Scott: There was all sorts of controversies coming out.

209
00:14:01,192 --> 00:14:03,690
Scott: They were crunching the team big time, right?

210
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:10,841
Rym: Yeah, that's one issue that we need that in general I could came up in this game for a lot of reasons But the video game industry is broken as shit.

211
00:14:11,182 --> 00:14:17,825
Scott: in the triple-a space in particular There was also issues where not only were they crunching they kept delaying.

212
00:14:18,226 --> 00:14:22,219
Scott: so it's like if you're delaying Right, you know, everyone's already buying the game.

213
00:14:22,701 --> 00:14:23,886
Scott: Just pull a half-life.

214
00:14:23,886 --> 00:14:23,946
Scott: 1.

215
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:24,890
Scott: It's ready when it's ready.

216
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:26,056
Scott: Why do you got to be like this?

217
00:14:26,318 --> 00:14:28,550
Rym: Yeah, well, especially because I've won is legendary.

218
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:39,576
Rym: We're gonna climb it now where if you announce a triple-a game that appeals to like a particular subset of gamers, you know exactly who I'm talking about.

219
00:14:39,937 --> 00:14:46,100
Rym: if you tell them a release date a Scary percentage of them will plan their lives around that date, which cool you can be into a thing.

220
00:14:46,601 --> 00:14:51,920
Rym: But then if that date changes they will not only flip out, but they will start harassing your developers.

221
00:14:52,344 --> 00:15:04,760
Rym: They'll start sending you death threats Like it's a problem almost to the point that like if I was a triple-a studio Even if I didn't have the philosophy you and I have of do it the way valve release games I wouldn't give release dates just to avoid that harassment.

222
00:15:05,702 --> 00:15:07,120
Scott: Yeah, like anyway.

223
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:16,379
Scott: So they delayed the game and they crunched the team at the same time To make this game and so the game finally comes out, right?

224
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,480
Rym: Yeah, and there were a number of controversies along the way that we talked about in the past.

225
00:15:20,701 --> 00:15:24,252
Scott: Well, so the actual release of the game was rocky.

226
00:15:24,373 --> 00:15:25,577
Scott: It wasn't just like here.

227
00:15:25,637 --> 00:15:28,185
Scott: it is it like Some people got it.

228
00:15:28,245 --> 00:15:32,095
Scott: reviewers got it, but reviewers only got the PC version, right?

229
00:15:32,115 --> 00:15:33,740
Scott: So reviewers only got the PC version.

230
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:40,097
Rym: They didn't get the console versions and it turns out the conversations don't fucking work, right?

231
00:15:40,117 --> 00:15:43,505
Scott: Well the reviewers got Gave it bad reviews.

232
00:15:43,605 --> 00:15:45,512
Scott: Well, not bad, but like sevens.

233
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:52,340
Rym: They gave it its I they gave it accurate Reviews and of course remember I refer to those gamers earlier.

234
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:59,845
Rym: Yeah, if you give any game that they're excited about a score of less than nine point eight, they'll send you death threats Right.

235
00:15:59,905 --> 00:16:10,377
Scott: So it's like there's these people who for some reason have never played this game Assume they can't possibly have anything wrapped up in the intellectual property.

236
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:11,861
Scott: It's not like it's Right.

237
00:16:12,663 --> 00:16:13,244
Scott: I don't understand.

238
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:23,380
Scott: they were just like somehow had become in in love with this game where they're like getting super mad That someone gave it a bad review insulted even though they've never played it.

239
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:27,780
Rym: I think about that sending a death threat to a developer for a game reviewer.

240
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:37,248
Rym: Yeah to a reviewer and a developer the developers for the late the delays and the reviewers for talking about the game Of a game that you have not played.

241
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:39,175
Rym: that does not have a franchise history.

242
00:16:39,557 --> 00:16:40,480
Rym: That isn't even out.

243
00:16:40,561 --> 00:16:41,480
Scott: Yeah, it does have a history.

244
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:46,400
Scott: But I just questioned whether the people who are sending the death threats have any involvement in the history whatsoever.

245
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:51,179
Rym: So but one of the issues that happened specifically was they wanted this wide release so they released it.

246
00:16:51,641 --> 00:17:02,759
Rym: You can technically run it on an or an x-bone like an actual Xbox one Xbox or a PlayStation 4 and Reviewers didn't see that as far as anyone can tell and people bought it.

247
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,348
Rym: They played it on those consoles and it went about.

248
00:17:05,407 --> 00:17:08,297
Scott: as they don't have a ps5 or an Xbox series.

249
00:17:08,357 --> 00:17:09,118
Rym: Nobody has a ps5.

250
00:17:11,921 --> 00:17:17,840
Rym: The only thing harder to get than a ps5 is a 3080.

251
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,671
Scott: She's like look what I got and I'm like who cares?

252
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,300
Scott: I mean actually I have a computer.

253
00:17:21,421 --> 00:17:28,996
Rym: I could if anyone I I could get a ps5 I did like any time But all I want is a 3080. if someone out there can get me a 3080.

254
00:17:28,996 --> 00:17:29,760
Rym: I'll do swaps ease.

255
00:17:30,982 --> 00:17:31,847
Scott: No, you're traded fee.

256
00:17:31,868 --> 00:17:33,619
Rym: I'll even pay the difference between the MSRP.

257
00:17:35,042 --> 00:17:44,325
Rym: But a lot of people got ps5s because they had connections But ps5 is not nearly as sold out as 3080s are obviously but there were a lot More ps5.

258
00:17:44,586 --> 00:17:45,168
Rym: it is not.

259
00:17:45,188 --> 00:17:57,846
Rym: we would be remiss to not point out that you and I and the people we are friends with in The gaming industry are more connected in a sense that it is easier to get something like a ps5 through No matter how many people I know.

260
00:17:57,887 --> 00:18:03,730
Scott: if I wanted one the way I would get it is just go to a website like everyone Else and just go to Amazon and be like bye and wait.

261
00:18:04,092 --> 00:18:10,312
Rym: Yeah, a lot of people I know got it By talking to someone who worked at a company who had extras or pulling shenanigans.

262
00:18:11,054 --> 00:18:17,613
Scott: I would not do that getting a review Console pre streaming edition of a console.

263
00:18:17,633 --> 00:18:21,808
Rym: a lot of streamers got him early Mexico PlayStation.

264
00:18:22,151 --> 00:18:23,380
Scott: Well, they don't have any on Amazon.

265
00:18:23,581 --> 00:18:30,450
Rym: So yeah, but yeah anyone out there if you can get me a 3080 I will die will get you a fucking ps5 and it'll be a good time.

266
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:50,714
Rym: so now they they're issuing refunds and apologizing and vowing to rebuild trust after they basically had to admit that this game just does not run on those old consoles because they Radically underpowered for a game of this scale really just built the way it was and designed the way it was like

267
00:18:51,823 --> 00:18:54,955
Scott: They crunched and they delayed and the game still.

268
00:18:54,995 --> 00:18:59,600
Scott: the console ports Basically are buggy and crashy and non-worky.

269
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:04,919
Rym: Well, a lot of it is just that the the console port the consoles are not powerful enough to even run the game.

270
00:19:05,503 --> 00:19:16,397
Scott: So like textures, you know I You know for you just make your software more optimized and also scale back on your.

271
00:19:16,538 --> 00:19:17,782
Scott: you know, right It's like.

272
00:19:17,822 --> 00:19:21,100
Scott: yeah, Mike my computer is weaker than someone who has a 3080.

273
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:25,260
Scott: But if I bought this game, which I never will you turn the settings down I can do settings down.

274
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,447
Rym: The problem is got your computer's no settings.

275
00:19:27,507 --> 00:19:39,960
Rym: your computer compared to any current generation console like not the ps5 Like let's say that's next-gen because they're coming out right now Your computer is infinitely more powerful than a current generation console That's true.

276
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:47,280
Scott: But a console release at least in theory right is like consoles historically have always been less powerful than PCs.

277
00:19:47,501 --> 00:19:53,780
Scott: But that's because when you release software for a console that software is usually running like exclusively, right?

278
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,840
Scott: You don't have like 10 web browsers open eating.

279
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,241
Scott: Yeah,

280
00:19:56,341 --> 00:20:02,320
Rym: like look at a look at it and also and then look at a PC game that was released the same year

281
00:20:03,164 --> 00:20:14,530
Scott: All right, and also because you're releasing a game for the console You know exactly what chips are in that machine and you can optimize your code At least if you bother to go through this effort.

282
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:33,839
Scott: and because you have to write if your game doesn't need it Or if you don't have the budget or time for it, you don't do this, but you can optimize specifically for those chips that you know are in the console and you know will work right and Make the same software just run better, even though the hardware is using less power and is weaker, right?

283
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:55,077
Scott: But whereas on a PC you would make a PC release of your game Unless you want to release the source code of your game and have everyone compile it on their own computers You're releasing an exe file and that exe file has to run on who knows how many different computers with different chips in them AMD's Intel's who knows what the fuck people have in their computer.

284
00:20:55,117 --> 00:20:55,639
Scott: It has to work.

285
00:20:57,541 --> 00:21:01,477
Scott: And so, you know this we have things to make this better than it used to be.

286
00:21:01,497 --> 00:21:06,120
Scott: in the DOS days We had to like, you know code for every sound card and make people choose their sound.

287
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,376
Scott: Yeah, now you just have DirectX.

288
00:21:10,417 --> 00:21:12,093
Scott: it's a lot easier But you still have to.

289
00:21:12,113 --> 00:21:24,840
Scott: you know You can't optimize as much and therefore since this exe is less optimized people need a more powerful video card Right in order to run that software a more powerful CPU to get the same performance.

290
00:21:25,281 --> 00:21:30,580
Rym: So all that aside the thing I want to talk about the most is something that was just kind of ridiculous and egregious.

291
00:21:31,061 --> 00:21:38,504
Rym: so cyberpunk 2077 has a kind of extreme Epilepsy triggers.

292
00:21:39,427 --> 00:21:48,860
Scott: Oh, yeah, which apparently I think people are speaking about one part in particular When you put on the glasses in the game a character puts on the glasses, it's at least based on the description.

293
00:21:49,001 --> 00:21:51,214
Scott: It sounded like a character was putting on the glasses.

294
00:21:51,275 --> 00:21:52,079
Scott: They live style.

295
00:21:52,682 --> 00:21:55,652
Scott: The glasses were very blinky blinky, but they were blinky blinky.

296
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:57,579
Rym: It's not even just like they were blinky blinky.

297
00:21:58,041 --> 00:22:00,713
Rym: They happen to be blinky blinky in a way.

298
00:22:00,774 --> 00:22:09,891
Rym: That is particularly extra dangerous to photosensitive people like some That style guide say avoid this pattern.

299
00:22:09,931 --> 00:22:12,660
Rym: if you're gonna do blinky blinky don't use red and white.

300
00:22:13,404 --> 00:22:17,545
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I think there was you know on Twitter I don't know the people who were tweeting.

301
00:22:17,585 --> 00:22:19,372
Scott: they could have been fake obviously who knows.

302
00:22:19,452 --> 00:22:34,860
Scott: but the people on Twitter were like people with Epilepsy who were saying yeah The blinky pattern was basically almost identical to the blinky pattern in the glasses The doctor has when the doctor needs to make you have an epileptic seizure on purpose for doctor reasons.

303
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,167
Scott: I'll make sure that you know, right and it's like.

304
00:22:37,227 --> 00:22:41,560
Scott: it's almost like someone took those glass almost as if someone took real life.

305
00:22:42,082 --> 00:22:48,690
Scott: Make someone with epilepsy have a seizure tool and turned it into a part of the game Like you would not be like.

306
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:52,908
Scott: we don't know if this was malicious intent But like you would not be.

307
00:22:53,451 --> 00:22:54,978
Scott: based on the smell is that rates are?

308
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,944
Rym: Indistinguishable when they?

309
00:22:56,964 --> 00:23:04,910
Scott: yes, right, but based on the descriptions I read you would not be Perhaps out of line and have being very sus.

310
00:23:05,231 --> 00:23:05,673
Scott: It's us.

311
00:23:05,753 --> 00:23:06,255
Scott: We'll see how.

312
00:23:06,435 --> 00:23:07,700
Rym: it's even worse than that.

313
00:23:08,162 --> 00:23:11,320
Rym: There was no warning in the game except in the EULA.

314
00:23:13,122 --> 00:23:13,644
Rym: The game didn't.

315
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:15,331
Rym: even you know most games like it.

316
00:23:15,431 --> 00:23:17,640
Rym: every NES game had a giant warning on it.

317
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,539
Rym: That was like hey if you have epilepsy don't play this game like.

318
00:23:20,579 --> 00:23:22,587
Scott: yeah Nintendo loves to put warnings.

319
00:23:22,607 --> 00:23:25,418
Scott: They even have warnings like hey, don't break your TV with your remote, right?

320
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:29,410
Scott: Yeah you know, they always have health and safety warning on fucking like.

321
00:23:29,431 --> 00:23:42,786
Rym: there was no warning in game and Even if let's say like there are use cases for that kind of effect but if you know anything you don't make the effect like This specific pattern.

322
00:23:42,826 --> 00:23:44,450
Rym: that is particularly dangerous.

323
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:56,350
Rym: this implies that nobody in their entire team Making this game over 500 people at any point talked about epilepsy or Accessibility or anything like.

324
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:57,133
Rym: this is all they were just.

325
00:23:57,174 --> 00:23:58,600
Scott: they were just crunching to get it done.

326
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,850
Scott: They were just crunching to get it, you know done done, right?

327
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:01,231
Scott: They weren't?

328
00:24:01,432 --> 00:24:03,300
Scott: all those other concerns go out the window, right?

329
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,133
Scott: That's what happens with that sort of culture of work is like just get it done.

330
00:24:08,174 --> 00:24:10,420
Scott: We care about making money first, right?

331
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,224
Scott: What can we cut away?

332
00:24:12,244 --> 00:24:13,066
Scott: You're right.

333
00:24:13,227 --> 00:24:14,430
Scott: We can cut away man.

334
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:19,865
Scott: Okay, don't spend time optimizing the console don't spend time On the accessibility right.

335
00:24:19,885 --> 00:24:23,396
Scott: that's not needed to put it on the store shelf.

336
00:24:23,898 --> 00:24:24,500
Scott: Don't do it.

337
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,107
Scott: We're working around the clock.

338
00:24:26,307 --> 00:24:27,653
Rym: Yeah, et cetera, but even worse.

339
00:24:27,713 --> 00:24:29,360
Rym: then they not only that warn people.

340
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,807
Rym: There's no option to disable it.

341
00:24:30,887 --> 00:24:32,757
Rym: Like it's like we're not saying that games can.

342
00:24:32,797 --> 00:24:33,440
Rym: I think they did?

343
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,652
Scott: They did put out a patch to do something about.

344
00:24:35,672 --> 00:24:43,800
Rym: yeah, they're doing they're doing stuff But this level of omission from a company like a project this big is particularly egregious.

345
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:47,195
Rym: This isn't some like indie developer in their basement making something for fun.

346
00:24:47,476 --> 00:24:48,762
Rym: who doesn't know better Like there's?

347
00:24:48,802 --> 00:24:52,897
Scott: no this is someone who spent all this money on marketing obviously instead of actually development.

348
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:56,369
Scott: Yep, right Make everyone want to buy a thing.

349
00:24:56,409 --> 00:24:58,739
Scott: who cares what the thing is, right Gabbo?

350
00:25:01,141 --> 00:25:23,736
Scott: So the final nail for this at least the the final nail I'm aware of and I don't know exactly which Content is causing these rumblings, but I have seen and read many many rumblings And from people I do know who they are so I'm inclined to believe them that there is Significant transphobic content in this game.

351
00:25:23,938 --> 00:25:25,183
Rym: Oh, yeah There's.

352
00:25:25,244 --> 00:25:25,926
Rym: there's that.

353
00:25:26,267 --> 00:25:33,712
Rym: there's also the fact that the game is kind of like Procop pro capitalism like it's literally the opposite of cyberpunk.

354
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:34,896
Scott: It's not what cyberpunk is.

355
00:25:35,417 --> 00:25:37,064
Scott: Yeah, exactly I don't know.

356
00:25:37,144 --> 00:25:40,500
Scott: and it's like I know, you know, I only know these meta things about this game.

357
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:49,660
Scott: So basically, you know my opinion beforehand right was like like I was saying I didn't know people cared about cyberpunk 2020 or knew about it except table top RPG people.

358
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,683
Scott: Why is this triple-a?

359
00:25:50,723 --> 00:25:51,907
Scott: enormous right?

360
00:25:52,348 --> 00:26:01,156
Scott: and my you know my feeling at the time of the big announcement was like I'll maybe I'll buy this in a steam sale one day when it's ten five dollar, right?

361
00:26:01,176 --> 00:26:02,060
Scott: It's a one-player game.

362
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,227
Scott: This is timeless.

363
00:26:03,267 --> 00:26:04,031
Scott: I need to play it now.

364
00:26:04,072 --> 00:26:05,037
Scott: It's not multiplayer, right?

365
00:26:05,078 --> 00:26:08,592
Scott: Whatever My feeling now is I will never play this game.

366
00:26:08,672 --> 00:26:10,260
Scott: Even if it's zero dollars fuck this game.

367
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,050
Scott: Yeah, this is obviously the biggest shit show we're gonna be.

368
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:24,298
Scott: you know, it's not a Duke Nukem Forever shit show but it's almost worse cuz Duke Nukem Forever was just Mismanagement and it's also this is like this is actually, you know harmful.

369
00:26:24,719 --> 00:26:29,476
Rym: Yeah Well, it's also almost worse because it is still pretty broadly popular and it's doing fine.

370
00:26:29,616 --> 00:26:30,499
Rym: Like they're gonna make their money.

371
00:26:31,226 --> 00:26:32,500
Scott: Oh, yeah, they're making big money.

372
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:37,719
Rym: Cuz you know Duke Nukem a lot of people lost money because of all those problems like that was a different situation.

373
00:26:37,739 --> 00:26:47,495
Rym: here They are like this game is going to continue to reward the broken Aspects of the games industry at the triple-a level almost to the point.

374
00:26:47,636 --> 00:26:48,640
Rym: I've said this before on GeekNights.

375
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,708
Rym: I've said it in panels of hacks.

376
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,312
Rym: They'll say it again.

377
00:26:50,332 --> 00:26:57,117
Rym: I Don't think triple-a games can be made ethically in the current world like full stop.

378
00:26:57,277 --> 00:26:58,200
Rym: I think it's impossible.

379
00:27:00,581 --> 00:27:02,227
Rym: And that resonates with that tweet.

380
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:04,254
Rym: you see it makes the rounds like every few months.

381
00:27:04,294 --> 00:27:11,900
Rym: it makes the rounds the tweet that says something Like I want to see shorter games with worse graphics made by people who work less hard, and I'm not kidding.

382
00:27:12,882 --> 00:27:14,755
Scott: Nope, I agree with that like the game.

383
00:27:14,775 --> 00:27:15,439
Rym: We're about to review.

384
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:22,438
Scott: Yeah, it's more fun to play links of the past randomizer than like, you know, like do maternal right?

385
00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:23,160
Scott: I played do maternal.

386
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:24,185
Scott: That was fun.

387
00:27:24,205 --> 00:27:24,747
Scott: Yeah, right.

388
00:27:24,848 --> 00:27:27,439
Scott: I paid I buy did buy it when it came out.

389
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,619
Rym: Yeah, I bought it when it came out.

390
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:29,379
Rym: It was good.

391
00:27:29,661 --> 00:27:37,506
Scott: I had a lot of fun with the previous doom and the previous doom and the previous doom and the previous Every doom You know, but you know what?

392
00:27:37,526 --> 00:27:41,000
Scott: I played it once I beat it and I was done even breath of the wild.

393
00:27:41,121 --> 00:27:41,524
Scott: I played it.

394
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:46,052
Scott: I played it longer than I played do maternal But I played it I beat it and I was done.

395
00:27:46,334 --> 00:27:47,399
Scott: links at best randomizer.

396
00:27:48,121 --> 00:27:50,027
Scott: I'm you know a game that's 20 years old.

397
00:27:50,689 --> 00:27:52,213
Rym: part of that your years older.

398
00:27:52,273 --> 00:27:54,600
Rym: your predilection has become become increasingly esoteric.

399
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,848
Scott: I'm just saying links at best randomizer is 30 years old.

400
00:27:56,908 --> 00:28:00,714
Scott: I think almost You know link to the past is almost 30 years old.

401
00:28:00,734 --> 00:28:01,559
Scott: the randomizer isn't?

402
00:28:02,524 --> 00:28:05,940
Scott: That's that gets more replay value than any of those things, right?

403
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:17,780
Rym: so saying that someone made me feel even older than when you brought up scuzzy and I remembered buying a scuzzy car to make My new cable modem work because previously the cable modem was plugged into an ISA scuzzy card and it wasn't fast enough.

404
00:28:19,286 --> 00:28:23,688
Rym: Mm-hmm ISA anyway it's in some other news.

405
00:28:23,708 --> 00:28:24,934
Rym: we can go through this stuff kind of quickly.

406
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:25,798
Rym: so we get to the main bit.

407
00:28:25,859 --> 00:28:34,099
Rym: but Nintendo there is a ton Relative ton of little indie games having remakes or releases on the switch.

408
00:28:34,862 --> 00:28:46,526
Scott: Yeah, Nintendo had a big announcement today as of this recording December 15th, and they announced a pile of indie games they're releasing and they also Added some more Super Nintendo games to the Super Nintendo app and whatnot.

409
00:28:46,546 --> 00:28:52,511
Scott: But anyway, so the games they added were Among us obviously right the biggest hit of 2020.

410
00:28:52,511 --> 00:28:55,140
Scott: I think that's a great game to have on switch.

411
00:28:55,341 --> 00:28:56,225
Scott: It's an easy port.

412
00:28:56,245 --> 00:28:56,607
Scott: They're gonna.

413
00:28:56,869 --> 00:29:01,329
Scott: they're gonna make money on that price on it for five bucks I imagine because that's what it costs on Steam.

414
00:29:01,349 --> 00:29:02,835
Scott: Maybe they charge more for it on switch.

415
00:29:02,855 --> 00:29:03,177
Scott: I don't know.

416
00:29:03,398 --> 00:29:03,900
Rym: No, it's five bucks.

417
00:29:04,041 --> 00:29:04,547
Rym: I just checked.

418
00:29:05,174 --> 00:29:08,289
Scott: Okay good But yeah, it cross plays too.

419
00:29:08,309 --> 00:29:11,160
Scott: So if you maybe you know, it's like do I need this?

420
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,044
Scott: Will I buy this?

421
00:29:12,345 --> 00:29:21,087
Scott: probably not but you know what I have among us on my PC You know, maybe you want to sit around with your friends and play among us, you know You don't want to use your phone.

422
00:29:21,127 --> 00:29:22,575
Scott: the switch is probably better experience.

423
00:29:22,615 --> 00:29:32,639
Rym: Yeah, the problem Here's the one problem I have the I can say like at that use case I can see like maybe I just want to lay On the couch and play among us while I'm on the discord instead of doing it like on my PC.

424
00:29:33,441 --> 00:29:40,015
Rym: usually it's not that case because I'm the one hosting the game, but When I'm at a con I imagine for a second.

425
00:29:40,196 --> 00:29:40,940
Rym: Hey, we all have switches.

426
00:29:41,221 --> 00:29:44,700
Rym: What if we just busted out in among us while we're all like sitting in line for the Omega thon?

427
00:29:45,185 --> 00:29:46,400
Scott: But yeah, you could do that now.

428
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:50,537
Rym: I've never successfully gotten the switch to play a local multiplayer online.

429
00:29:50,577 --> 00:29:54,280
Rym: wife our local Game at a convention in my entire life.

430
00:29:55,022 --> 00:29:56,888
Scott: This would obviously use the internet right?

431
00:29:56,908 --> 00:29:59,496
Scott: You'd only they say local local Wi-Fi.

432
00:29:59,817 --> 00:30:00,960
Scott: Oh, they added that good job.

433
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,819
Scott: We'll see if it works for any player online or via local Wi-Fi.

434
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:08,815
Scott: So next see they spelunky and spelunky - obviously legendary platformy roguelike II.

435
00:30:09,056 --> 00:30:10,440
Scott: ish game, right?

436
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:14,131
Scott: If you haven't if you don't know spelunky, well, you know, it's on switch now.

437
00:30:14,191 --> 00:30:14,793
Scott: They're fun of them.

438
00:30:15,535 --> 00:30:17,200
Scott: Yeah, they're hard grind really hard.

439
00:30:18,541 --> 00:30:22,456
Scott: Grind stone is a game that I played when I had a free trial of Apple arcade.

440
00:30:22,517 --> 00:30:23,380
Scott: I played it on my iPad.

441
00:30:24,023 --> 00:30:28,339
Scott: It's like a little kind of puzzly game, but it's not like micro transaction II.

442
00:30:28,902 --> 00:30:32,736
Scott: Right and it's sort of like one of those almost like a pattern recognizing one.

443
00:30:32,777 --> 00:30:33,539
Scott: Do you remember that?

444
00:30:35,201 --> 00:30:36,365
Scott: What was that one on?

445
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:37,309
Scott: the?

446
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:39,397
Scott: was on the GBA or the DS?

447
00:30:39,517 --> 00:30:40,220
Scott: I think was DS.

448
00:30:41,222 --> 00:30:43,957
Rym: Remember that game that was on the GBA or the DS.

449
00:30:43,998 --> 00:30:49,685
Scott: Yes It's on the DS and I think it was like a might and magic and there was like you will line up the monsters of The right color.

450
00:30:49,807 --> 00:30:51,120
Rym: I know exactly what you're talking about.

451
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,440
Rym: It was a it had a name was here was a might magic like special something something like that.

452
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,627
Scott: But the point is it's not.

453
00:30:57,090 --> 00:31:02,455
Scott: the puzzle isn't like that puzzle But it's that same kind of game where you're optimizing like your next lash of heroes.

454
00:31:02,495 --> 00:31:03,800
Rym: I think is it yes?

455
00:31:03,881 --> 00:31:11,419
Scott: So like you're this little Viking warrior, dude And like you optimizing like what your next move is gonna be on this grid of like monsters and things, right?

456
00:31:12,307 --> 00:31:13,620
Scott: So it's actually a pretty fun game.

457
00:31:13,742 --> 00:31:18,971
Scott: I got bored of it after a while But I occupied my pre bedtime gaming for like a few days.

458
00:31:19,512 --> 00:31:20,435
Scott: a good toilet game.

459
00:31:20,555 --> 00:31:22,804
Rym: I say I kind of want to play clash of Heroes again.

460
00:31:22,824 --> 00:31:24,052
Scott: Yeah, why not?

461
00:31:24,233 --> 00:31:24,978
Scott: It was actually real.

462
00:31:25,058 --> 00:31:29,723
Scott: go Calico is a game I saw at PAX East.

463
00:31:29,864 --> 00:31:31,673
Scott: I think maybe I saw it.

464
00:31:31,814 --> 00:31:41,506
Scott: maybe at magfest also I don't remember but it's basically a game where you're building a Cat cafe right.

465
00:31:41,546 --> 00:31:52,080
Scott: so it's a little neko Atsume not microtransaction II right and if you look at the trailer It's like you're going around the woods riding cute animals and then arranging your cafe.

466
00:31:53,681 --> 00:31:56,771
Scott: This game seems to be like way good.

467
00:31:58,276 --> 00:31:59,239
Scott: I might get this kid.

468
00:32:01,285 --> 00:32:12,793
Scott: And then the long-awaited right super meat boy forever that we have seen at Various conventions in its, you know pre-release state pretty much forever.

469
00:32:12,813 --> 00:32:15,100
Scott: Yeah, I think it's apt that they called it forever too.

470
00:32:15,281 --> 00:32:17,334
Scott: Like I said, this is much like do do come forever.

471
00:32:17,736 --> 00:32:25,034
Scott: It's in development But yes, it's finally a real full-on sequel to super meat boy.

472
00:32:25,195 --> 00:32:30,040
Rym: more new super meat boy thousands of levels and many different characters.

473
00:32:31,362 --> 00:32:39,679
Scott: Yep, it's gonna come out on December 23rd And I think the only console it will be on at the time will be the switch.

474
00:32:40,262 --> 00:32:48,602
Rym: I think it might be on PC at the same time also Perfect for that so I can play forever try to get trying to finish a level so I can watch the replay and go to Sleep.

475
00:32:49,289 --> 00:32:53,380
Scott: it will not be on Expones or PlayStations at least not immediately.

476
00:32:53,781 --> 00:32:59,878
Scott: It will only it'll be on switches and I think possibly PC on December 23rd this year the for real.

477
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,606
Scott: It's actually You know done done.

478
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:04,151
Scott: here it comes more meat.

479
00:33:04,572 --> 00:33:06,278
Rym: yep, there's a bunch of more games in the list.

480
00:33:06,298 --> 00:33:06,940
Rym: you can check it out?

481
00:33:07,101 --> 00:33:07,482
Scott: I don't know.

482
00:33:07,502 --> 00:33:09,592
Scott: There's all the games on the list, but I don't know anything about those.

483
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:11,420
Rym: looks pretty good a happy game.

484
00:33:11,662 --> 00:33:18,296
Rym: I don't know if I've heard of it or not But it's described as a psychedelic horror game set in a bizarre dream world and this game.

485
00:33:18,337 --> 00:33:20,443
Scott: sure some of these games are great I'm just don't know them.

486
00:33:20,544 --> 00:33:26,183
Rym: Yeah, but the image of it looks particularly good and weird in a way that jives with me Very nice.

487
00:33:26,824 --> 00:33:32,500
Rym: the switch is also getting an anime watching app to watch Funimation, but not crunchyroll anime.

488
00:33:32,842 --> 00:33:34,592
Rym: But that doesn't matter cuz crunchyroll is gone.

489
00:33:34,632 --> 00:33:36,040
Rym: We'll talk about that next week on Wednesday.

490
00:33:36,886 --> 00:33:40,427
Rym: Yeah There's so much so everywhere yep.

491
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,614
Rym: Yep wait till next Thursday.

492
00:33:42,634 --> 00:33:44,760
Rym: We could we could do a whole show just on what Disney announced.

493
00:33:46,046 --> 00:33:53,658
Rym: We don't need to do that There's one like ten more Star Wars shows literally literally ten.

494
00:33:55,361 --> 00:33:59,980
Rym: But yeah this the app will let you watch anime on your switch if your switch is your device.

495
00:34:00,822 --> 00:34:09,799
Rym: I feel like this is mostly aimed at kids who don't have an HTPC or a PC or a tablet and Want to watch anime at home or on their house?

496
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:19,618
Rym: but anyway things Of the day, what do you got?

497
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,424
Scott: What was my thing of the day?

498
00:34:21,524 --> 00:34:22,487
Scott: It was the right?

499
00:34:22,547 --> 00:34:23,230
Rym: Yeah, okay?

500
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:27,469
Scott: So my friend we were having a discussion and someone linked this to me a friend.

501
00:34:28,331 --> 00:34:34,465
Scott: There is a YouTube channel called ordinary sausage and my thing of the day is just gonna be one of their videos although the whole channel.

502
00:34:35,933 --> 00:34:39,435
Scott: I watched some other videos in the channel and they were okay But this one was the best one.

503
00:34:39,514 --> 00:34:45,335
Scott: and what this channel is is there is a person and this person has Sausage making equipment.

504
00:34:45,496 --> 00:34:45,737
Scott: right.

505
00:34:45,777 --> 00:34:48,830
Scott: they have you know sausage wrappings, right?

506
00:34:49,090 --> 00:35:05,569
Scott: They have a grinder with which to grind up things to put into the sausage And they have I guess I don't know what the device is called a sausage press where you squeeze You know you put your sausage wrapping on the end of the pipe you squeeze whatever your filling is and it goes into the sausage Which you can then twist off and seal.

507
00:35:07,254 --> 00:35:11,880
Scott: and then of course they have a stove with a frying pan on which to cook sausage.

508
00:35:12,542 --> 00:35:22,630
Scott: and all they do on this channel is take things that Are you know some more unusual than others and they put them into the sausage, right?

509
00:35:23,392 --> 00:35:24,897
Scott: If it needs grinding they grind it.

510
00:35:25,178 --> 00:35:30,536
Scott: if it you know needs mushing they mush it right and they just make Sausages of various things.

511
00:35:30,616 --> 00:35:36,773
Scott: and here they make a sausage just filled with oil Just oil.

512
00:35:37,234 --> 00:35:41,907
Rym: the best about the videos where they pour oil in the pan to then cook the oil sausage.

513
00:35:42,609 --> 00:35:42,790
Scott: yep.

514
00:35:43,911 --> 00:35:48,906
Scott: So for another example of video on this channel that was actually like you know a less ridiculous one is.

515
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:50,110
Scott: they made a McRib sausage.

516
00:35:50,252 --> 00:36:00,519
Scott: They took an entire McRib sandwich You know bread and all ground it squeezed it in and actually they gave that five stars like and I could understand Yeah, that could be a good sausage.

517
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,450
Rym: It'd probably be better than just a McRib.

518
00:36:03,251 --> 00:36:05,584
Scott: Yeah, maybe but you know that's what.

519
00:36:05,604 --> 00:36:06,630
Scott: that's what you have here.

520
00:36:06,811 --> 00:36:10,670
Scott: And also I just want to give this isn't thing of the day worthy because it's sort of cheating.

521
00:36:10,771 --> 00:36:12,109
Scott: But I just want to mention this video.

522
00:36:13,111 --> 00:36:14,796
Scott: There's a video how to make fried water.

523
00:36:14,816 --> 00:36:23,720
Scott: There's what they did is they took water, and they used some sort of this Chemical that you get from algae.

524
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,885
Scott: It's like something something out.

525
00:36:24,926 --> 00:36:29,983
Scott: sodium alginate I think they said, but there's other varieties other different alginates like semi.

526
00:36:30,003 --> 00:36:31,709
Rym: solidify the water right.

527
00:36:31,749 --> 00:36:37,770
Scott: what it does Is it allows you to form a membrane around the water so basically like a little water bottle right?

528
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:38,753
Scott: That's sort of like goopy.

529
00:36:39,274 --> 00:36:41,080
Scott: it almost looks like a jellyfish blob right.

530
00:36:41,582 --> 00:36:58,610
Scott: and then they took that jellyfish blob Floured it breadcrumb you know egged it breadcrumbed it right and then fried it in oil And without getting it to pop and thus making fried water And that I thought that was mildly interesting, but also sort of cheating right.

531
00:36:59,892 --> 00:37:12,817
Scott: And also when they ate it they sort of like didn't just pop the whole thing in their mouth They squirted the water out, so that's why they don't get they're not thinking that a status cuz they're Yeah strong the oil sausage commits the oil straws.

532
00:37:12,837 --> 00:37:15,598
Scott: it is much more powerful and Terrifying.

533
00:37:15,638 --> 00:37:23,253
Rym: do not eat this Yeah, so yeah You know I'll go.

534
00:37:23,635 --> 00:37:27,750
Rym: one of my things today was the worth the kids channel because they may other than big top burger.

535
00:37:28,153 --> 00:37:45,140
Rym: They've made many recent delightful Meme-able animated shorts like Palpatine's journey like just solid channel making great content and all the content though most of the things they uploaded had sort of Like a similar aesthetic style of writing style of humor, and that's cool.

536
00:37:45,361 --> 00:37:45,704
Rym: Say like.

537
00:37:45,724 --> 00:37:50,190
Rym: the animation looks similar like I'm down for that But that meant I couldn't just keep using them as a thing of the day.

538
00:37:50,231 --> 00:37:52,159
Rym: over and over again goes against the GeekNights code.

539
00:37:53,681 --> 00:37:57,500
Rym: Today they uploaded something very different from what they've done up to this point.

540
00:37:58,064 --> 00:38:05,660
Rym: It looks like stop-motion animation And it's a music video to just a straight-up song dried up old bones by Tom Willett.

541
00:38:06,722 --> 00:38:10,245
Rym: Okay, the skeleton in the desert But it's particularly where they can.

542
00:38:10,285 --> 00:38:13,334
Scott: were they commissioned by this person to make the music video?

543
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:19,418
Rym: for oh, no if I if I if I Am correct I've Tom Williams who I think it is he was like in the 70s.

544
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,933
Rym: Okay, but I don't know if it's the same Tom Willett.

545
00:38:23,953 --> 00:38:25,360
Rym: I did not do any research on this.

546
00:38:25,704 --> 00:38:27,521
Scott: I'm not and it's not a person I know about

547
00:38:27,842 --> 00:38:50,196
Rym: but the video is extra great because it's just he's singing this country kind of song about us being a bones died In the desert and all his friends come to check him out like the desert spider and there's a cute desert spider kind of dancing next to him and his friend the snake who's dancing and it's clearly a rattlesnake who is Warning him away, and it's just really cute and fun and good, and you should watch it.

548
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:55,384
Rym: hmm in the meta moment Can't go anywhere.

549
00:38:55,404 --> 00:38:56,809
Rym: We're still here.

550
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:59,599
Scott: obviously I have not received the book signal.

551
00:39:00,221 --> 00:39:01,946
Scott: What signal out there in the sky?

552
00:39:01,967 --> 00:39:04,515
Rym: yeah, actually I was playing a hypnospace outlaw.

553
00:39:04,755 --> 00:39:06,060
Rym: I was also working on stuff.

566
00:39:48,661 --> 00:39:56,863
Scott: Yeah, I'm just live-streaming myself solving these coding puzzles every night until I guess Christmas which wouldn't be the last ones To stick on your keyboard.

567
00:39:56,883 --> 00:39:57,707
Rym: so we get some ASMR Scott.

568
00:40:01,362 --> 00:40:03,740
Scott: Well, I've actually worked hard to get rid of the keyboard noise.

569
00:40:05,785 --> 00:40:10,870
Scott: But you know if you go to my YouTube There's a few of the first three or four.

570
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:12,133

00:40:24,896 --> 00:40:25,138
Scott: You know.

576
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:27,398

Scott: Maybe I'll bike today after dinner.

580
00:40:35,845 --> 00:40:37,779
Scott: But the problem is I need to do the puzzle also.

581
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:40,489
Scott: I think that's sort of what's you know.

582

00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,058
Scott: It's too hard.

584
00:40:43,098 --> 00:40:43,600

598
00:41:26,867 --> 00:41:27,068
Scott: well.

599
00:41:27,128 --> 00:41:27,450
Scott: We can.

600
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:28,960
Scott: we're trying to make a good one over here.

601
00:41:29,101 --> 00:41:31,318
Scott: So you know it'll be better with you in it.

602
00:41:33,561 --> 00:41:41,252
Scott: So let's talk about Hypno space outlaw Alright, so again at PAX long long ago.

603
00:41:41,694 --> 00:41:42,558
Scott: Maybe a magfest.

604
00:41:42,578 --> 00:41:43,584
Scott: who remembers This

605
00:41:43,604 --> 00:41:54,570
Rym: is one of those games where I saw it Like I walked over and I looked at it and all I thought was I don't need to even play this now or talk to Those people I'm just gonna play this game Someday when it is rare

606
00:41:54,611 --> 00:41:54,852
Scott: was.

607
00:41:55,315 --> 00:41:56,100
Scott: there was a Siri.

608
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:56,700
Scott: I can't remember.

609
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:06,000
Scott: I don't know which ones came first or anything like that But there was a. there was like a trend of games that that where the user interface of the game looked like an old computer.

610
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:09,690
Rym: There were multiple indie games that did this effectively right.

611
00:42:09,711 --> 00:42:18,843
Scott: well the oldest one that I personally remember playing was uplink Which is didn't really look like an old computer, but it was still a game where you're ostensibly You know you.

612
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:25,823
Scott: are you using a computer that has an interface that wasn't the uplink interface wasn't anything like a normal Windows.

613
00:42:25,883 --> 00:42:26,826
Rym: it was like thing right.

614
00:42:27,027 --> 00:42:31,864
Rym: movie hacking like you were playing a movie exactly doing movie hacking But then there were other games.

615
00:42:31,884 --> 00:42:33,650
Scott: You know all right other notable games like.

616
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:34,553
Scott: Emily is away.

617
00:42:34,694 --> 00:42:35,456
Scott: Emily is away.

618
00:42:35,477 --> 00:42:39,048
Scott: the user interface Looks exactly like a little instant messenger.

619
00:42:39,128 --> 00:42:48,845
Scott: It's obviously a well instant messenger for Windows 95 right but You know it obviously doesn't say Windows 95 on it or a well as to message on it right But you basically it's.

620
00:42:49,227 --> 00:43:05,760
Scott: Emily is away is like a visual novel But you're basically chatting with people and making dialogue decisions through what looks like ale instant messenger, so hypno space outlaw is About this sort of never really existed, but yeah it totally existed.

621
00:43:06,702 --> 00:43:11,900
Scott: late 90s online service much like prodigy AOL CompuServe right.

622
00:43:13,084 --> 00:43:17,372
Scott: however It is none of those right.

623
00:43:17,432 --> 00:43:19,119
Scott: It's sort of all of them and none of them.

624
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:24,656
Rym: Yeah, because it's also like an internet simulator where you have like a computer that you're running with like browsers.

625
00:43:24,736 --> 00:43:26,000
Scott: right you have a computer.

626
00:43:26,541 --> 00:43:39,179
Scott: Right you can run hypno space software on this computer, but the thing is hypno space is not just like a normal internet service From the late 90s although it is the late 90s, and it has late 90s vaporwave aesthetic to it

627
00:43:40,541 --> 00:43:41,043
Rym: But it's more

628
00:43:41,084 --> 00:43:41,606
Scott: just less

629
00:43:41,626 --> 00:43:45,120
Rym: vaporwave and more true to what that aesthetic was in its time.

630
00:43:46,263 --> 00:43:47,053
Scott: Both I think.

631
00:43:47,276 --> 00:43:50,750
Scott: yeah But hypno space is an internet service.

632
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:53,479
Scott: You can only use while you're asleep, so you would go to sleep.

633
00:43:54,541 --> 00:43:59,020
Scott: It's like up time for bit like you go about your day right which isn't part of the game at all.

634
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:06,048
Scott: Go about your day, and then at the end of your day It's time to go to sleep, and it's like well You're gonna waste eight hours of the day if you just sleep.

635
00:44:06,148 --> 00:44:07,734
Scott: sleep like a normal person right.

636
00:44:08,155 --> 00:44:14,919
Scott: so plug in hypno space And your body will sleep, but you can have productive hours Doing hypno space shit.

637
00:44:15,462 --> 00:44:21,132
Rym: And it's kind of like how I actually used computers because I would go about my day Be like midnight, and then instead of going to bed.

638
00:44:21,193 --> 00:44:25,938
Rym: I'd sit down in front of my computer I'd dial in to like Wow or whatever and I'd be online all night.

639
00:44:27,481 --> 00:44:32,037
Scott: But imagine if you also got sleep right so it hit no space right?

640
00:44:32,057 --> 00:44:36,389
Scott: you know in the Realistically speaking you're not actually going to sleep right?

641
00:44:36,409 --> 00:44:38,779
Scott: your character is going to sleep into hypno space.

642
00:44:38,859 --> 00:44:41,399
Scott: yeah But you're sitting there, and you have this mouse.

643
00:44:42,022 --> 00:44:44,007
Scott: You know keyboard based user interface.

644
00:44:44,409 --> 00:44:47,518
Scott: that looks a lot like a late 90s online web service.

645
00:44:47,558 --> 00:44:48,220
Rym: like to the point.

646
00:44:48,521 --> 00:44:51,250
Rym: It's so spot-on like there's a browser.

647
00:44:51,370 --> 00:44:54,300
Rym: It's basically got a win amp installed as an application.

648
00:44:55,561 --> 00:44:59,320
Scott: Yeah, it's like they put a lot of effort into this making it complete.

649
00:44:59,582 --> 00:45:05,692
Scott: It's not one of those things where it's like oh Yeah, you can only click on a few things, and it's mostly just pick.

650
00:45:05,712 --> 00:45:06,635
Scott: you know a background.

651
00:45:06,715 --> 00:45:09,306
Rym: everything works like When we start the game.

652
00:45:09,627 --> 00:45:13,665
Rym: it does a little like bios load, and if it says like hold B It for by if you do that.

653
00:45:13,725 --> 00:45:14,931
Rym: There's a fucking BIOS.

654
00:45:15,493 --> 00:45:17,100
Scott: Yeah, it's like you know you could.

655
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,105
Scott: There's like a search engine.

656
00:45:18,145 --> 00:45:18,808
Scott: you can search.

657
00:45:18,868 --> 00:45:20,496
Scott: you can find things when you search.

658
00:45:20,536 --> 00:45:21,380
Scott: you can click links.

659
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:25,231
Scott: They work install software that get install software.

660
00:45:25,271 --> 00:45:26,554
Scott: you can remove software.

661
00:45:26,614 --> 00:45:27,778
Scott: you can get viruses.

662
00:45:27,818 --> 00:45:28,660
Scott: you can play music.

663
00:45:28,781 --> 00:45:31,000
Scott: You can download more music and add it.

664
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:43,074
Scott: it's like they have just created so much content that it feels like an complete Internet service right yep, so how is this a fucking game?

665
00:45:43,175 --> 00:45:48,760
Scott: isn't it just like a you know just a You know sort of like a sandbox where you explore all the content that they made?

666
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:52,037
Rym: Sandbox, I think I still would have enjoyed it.

667
00:45:52,803 --> 00:46:07,395
Scott: Oh, I probably still would have also for quite a while But not as long as if it was a game because basically the game on the one hand reveals to you a great story But also Forces you to explore the content that they've created.

668
00:46:07,435 --> 00:46:07,615
Scott: right.

669
00:46:07,636 --> 00:46:15,599
Scott: so by playing the game You're sort of forced to follow this path along which you are seeing all the great stuff that they made.

670
00:46:15,679 --> 00:46:21,220
Rym: yep You're basically playing someone who for whatever reason volunteered to be a moderator in Hypno space.

671
00:46:21,802 --> 00:46:25,717
Rym: So you have a special version of the software in some ways.

672
00:46:25,777 --> 00:46:32,094
Scott: It's almost Like Pokemon snap only you you control the vehicle right where it's like.

673
00:46:32,515 --> 00:46:53,800
Scott: you know they've created all these wonderful Pokemon for you to see and enjoy watching them right along the sides all these web pages songs you know Places in Hypno space right emails things for you to see and do And you're going along enjoying them right, but you're charting your own course.

674
00:46:53,961 --> 00:46:57,900
Scott: But you also definitely have a target that they've given you of where you want to get to right.

675
00:46:59,424 --> 00:47:01,039
Scott: And what's really amazing is that?

676
00:47:02,121 --> 00:47:10,974
Scott: All this content even though it's all kinds of varied random stuff it really feels Like the drama and the social aspect.

677
00:47:11,054 --> 00:47:11,255
Scott: right.

678
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:12,840
Scott: there's these fake characters.

679
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:15,499
Scott: They're obviously not real people right, but they're really made.

680
00:47:16,601 --> 00:47:17,525
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

681
00:47:17,987 --> 00:47:21,540
Scott: you know there's the chowder man right and you go to the chowder man's webpage, right?

682
00:47:21,781 --> 00:47:26,160
Scott: And it's like then you'll see a comment on another web page from the chowder man, right?

683
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:29,189
Scott: It's like there's all these characters that they've made up.

684
00:47:29,229 --> 00:47:31,817
Scott: who have are the other people in Hypno space?

685
00:47:31,877 --> 00:47:36,477
Rym: like the first job You get as a moderator is there's a report of this kid Zane is harassing people.

686
00:47:36,758 --> 00:47:38,065
Rym: so you're like I'm gonna find him.

687
00:47:38,145 --> 00:47:40,880
Rym: you find Zane's web page, and it's amazing.

688
00:47:41,583 --> 00:47:44,517
Rym: But then you fuck around and like look for like all right who is he harassing?

689
00:47:44,557 --> 00:47:45,100
Rym: What's going on?

690
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:54,920
Rym: You gotta kind of like do some detective work And you find all these other people who have interacted with Zane in some capacity And like you can solve the puzzle.

691
00:47:54,920 --> 00:48:00,217
Rym: It's almost like a puzzle game like the puzzle in this one was find some reason to ban Zane like.

692
00:48:00,258 --> 00:48:03,930
Rym: that's what they want you To do and you've reached trivial to find a reason to ban Zane.

693
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:06,439
Rym: you find his secret web page, and he's a little piece of shit.

694
00:48:07,394 --> 00:48:13,132
Rym: but Then you find all these other people and you find all this other interesting stuff.

695
00:48:13,453 --> 00:48:16,180
Rym: That's also kind of relevant to the Zane situation.

696
00:48:20,061 --> 00:48:22,826
Scott: Mm-hmm Such a just a punk kid.

697
00:48:22,866 --> 00:48:27,943
Rym: he's a punk kid doesn't know better and the people he's harassing are also kind of harassing him And it's like this right.

698
00:48:28,104 --> 00:48:29,870
Rym: They're all teenagers right.

699
00:48:29,911 --> 00:48:31,035
Scott: This is what I was trying to get at.

700
00:48:31,135 --> 00:48:36,760
Scott: is that all this content They've made has a second level and this well has multiple levels.

701
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:43,505
Scott: But the the second level is that it's even though it's very random stuff Right it's.

702
00:48:44,147 --> 00:48:45,069
Scott: you can see.

703
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:50,487
Scott: it feels like you're a part of a real internet community That is developing and you can.

704
00:48:50,587 --> 00:49:00,578
Scott: you're experiencing the drama between the people much like you experience drama if you're the part of something like a live journal community or a tumblr community or any of the.

705
00:49:00,638 --> 00:49:11,240
Scott: you know a Forum on the web somewhere or some IRC channel and you see you have characters that you know based on their internet names and the drama That plays out between them and their different personalities.

706
00:49:12,141 --> 00:49:14,128
Scott: This is totally believable.

707
00:49:14,168 --> 00:49:17,620
Scott: you could have put this on a web page and people would believe it was a real forum.

708
00:49:18,242 --> 00:49:24,320
Scott: Yeah, and it wasn't just a piece of art right the imitating life because it is the thing that is so amazing about this game.

709
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:24,882
Rym: It's like Scott.

710
00:49:24,923 --> 00:49:28,538
Rym: I grew up in the era where the internet was like very much like this.

711
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:42,769
Rym: pretty much this game For us is also deeply nostalgic like I would interact with things and see things that I Specifically recognize as touchstones of the way I use the.

712
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:46,799
Scott: I had real web pages that you could if you could somehow find them.

713
00:49:47,805 --> 00:49:50,379
Rym: Oh, I made some pages that look a lot like pages in here.

714
00:49:50,997 --> 00:50:03,579
Scott: Yeah the oldest web pages of For my old days that I still have are like from 2000. if you could find my ninety nine ninety eight ninety seven like earlier web pages You could just paste them into hypno space outlaw as no changes.

715
00:50:04,505 --> 00:50:07,100
Scott: No, you could find my geocities page.

716
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:08,067
Scott: You can just paste it right in.

717
00:50:08,168 --> 00:50:13,794
Rym: and when Scott I first became friends in RIT I remember we showed each other our geocities pages because geocities was still up.

718
00:50:14,677 --> 00:50:15,239
Scott: It was yeah.

719
00:50:16,442 --> 00:50:17,930
Rym: If only we thought to back that shit up.

720
00:50:19,458 --> 00:50:20,383
Scott: I Mean I tried.

721
00:50:20,866 --> 00:50:22,515
Rym: yeah, I mean I could have just downloaded the.

722
00:50:22,857 --> 00:50:23,379
Scott: I backed up.

723
00:50:23,621 --> 00:50:28,160
Scott: I do have backups going pretty far, but not just like just a little bit past.

724
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:28,901
Scott: I can't get.

725
00:50:29,201 --> 00:50:40,190
Rym: yeah, but anyway for someone who did not grow up in that era like you might miss like there's references to like Specific technology things that you might not notice that wouldn't matter.

726
00:50:40,311 --> 00:50:49,847
Rym: but for a younger person who didn't grow up in that world I think this game is equally compelling because it's almost like a Simulation of a previous era.

727
00:50:50,108 --> 00:50:59,539
Rym: it is very true to the feeling like if you play through this game You will feel the kinds of things that we felt when we were young interacting with a very different internet.

728
00:51:01,302 --> 00:51:02,931
Rym: It's very true to that feeling.

729
00:51:02,971 --> 00:51:06,707
Rym: it's very true to that experience and That is kind of amazing.

730
00:51:06,767 --> 00:51:20,153
Rym: like that shows that the people who made this game really Understood like what the internet and what services like prodigy pre-internet were like Mm-hmm.

731
00:51:21,018 --> 00:51:22,406
Scott: so yeah, there is a greater.

732
00:51:23,431 --> 00:51:29,050
Scott: It is sort of a visual novel situation where there is a greater plot right that you are discovering.

733
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:31,196
Rym: It's a pretty good plot to like.

734
00:51:31,257 --> 00:51:37,038
Scott: it does have an ending at some point although after the ending you obviously can load up Hypno space and just sort of.

735
00:51:37,139 --> 00:51:44,861
Scott: you know poke around all the content You know to see everything a freely as you would like And is because of the way the interface is.

736
00:51:44,901 --> 00:51:46,690
Scott: there's tons and tons of hidden stuff.

737
00:51:47,694 --> 00:51:53,290
Rym: Like so it's so free It's you know and so fully featured, but the gameplay loop like if you want to think about like what is this?

738
00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:54,330
Rym: What are you doing in this game?

739
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:55,790
Rym: It comes down to you're a moderator.

740
00:51:56,372 --> 00:52:03,832
Rym: You get emails and dispatches from like the people who run the company who are like like deal with this report like there go find This problem.

741
00:52:03,872 --> 00:52:07,446
Rym: There's some malware someone uploaded like go find it and like tell us where it is.

742
00:52:07,466 --> 00:52:10,336
Rym: we get rid of it and You can click on links.

743
00:52:10,697 --> 00:52:19,182
Rym: You can follow people's stuff install their software and even to search type of word and You can solve a lot of things with clever human intelligence.

744
00:52:19,202 --> 00:52:27,070
Rym: the game has like no rails really Except a few very specific rails based on certain plot events like when you get to the image map.

745
00:52:28,514 --> 00:52:36,170
Scott: Yep But also you know depending on certain choices right the game might be easier or more difficult to you.

746
00:52:36,431 --> 00:52:44,970
Rym: Like if you get a virus and it's it'll be bothering you all the time Yeah, but move it like the way to solve an early puzzle is to kind of get a virus on purpose.

747
00:52:45,897 --> 00:52:50,044
Scott: Yep Professor you are you gonna pay money for the virus remover?

748
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:51,410
Scott: It's like you can buy software.

749
00:52:51,892 --> 00:53:03,150
Scott: Yeah in this like there's like this e-commerce like you can get money in the game and then go and there's things to buy with The money right, but there's like a little bit like I won't spoil stuff about this game because there's a lot in here.

750
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:07,130
Rym: But what I will say is that professor helper was obviously malware.

751
00:53:07,877 --> 00:53:08,522
Rym: But no shit.

752
00:53:09,653 --> 00:53:18,210
Rym: the task I had was Find like this anyone who's using this cash app that like we don't allow on our platform to transfer money and get rid of it.

753
00:53:18,591 --> 00:53:22,630
Rym: And it's obvious that this malware is using that cash app to steal money from people.

754
00:53:23,091 --> 00:53:27,865
Rym: So I installed a malware and then the malware gives me pop-ups that link to the cash app.

755
00:53:28,046 --> 00:53:29,008
Rym: that let me find.

756
00:53:29,029 --> 00:53:29,510
Rym: the people who?

757
00:53:29,570 --> 00:53:30,135
Rym: Are scamming.

758
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:31,990
Rym: but now I've still got malware.

759
00:53:32,653 --> 00:53:35,686
Rym: So I reported the malware which I was not tasked to do.

760
00:53:35,766 --> 00:53:37,342
Rym: like you could report malware I reported it.

761
00:53:37,931 --> 00:53:44,709
Rym: They rejected my report and the CEO of the company starts bitching at me for reporting it because he's trying to make a deal with that company.

762
00:53:47,112 --> 00:54:00,025
Rym: The other thing is very true in this game that I found really fun Is that the two people who run merchants off like the company that runs all this they are to a T Exactly how people who ran those 90s internet startups were like.

763
00:54:00,085 --> 00:54:03,596
Scott: it's a very Steve Jobs Wozniak kind of do right.

764
00:54:03,857 --> 00:54:09,560
Rym: one of them right incorporates others and has like a modicum appearance of ethics.

765
00:54:10,488 --> 00:54:12,437
Rym: and But I'm saying a modicum here.

766
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:13,241
Rym: There's a lot going on.

767
00:54:13,281 --> 00:54:14,366
Rym: Not just right.

768
00:54:14,406 --> 00:54:15,170
Scott: That's the tech guy.

769
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:16,453
Scott: There's a technical guy.

770
00:54:16,613 --> 00:54:23,952
Scott: a technical guy clearly has some sort of morals and ethics right wants things to work a certain way Etc.

771
00:54:24,253 --> 00:54:25,618
Scott: and then is the business guy.

772
00:54:25,638 --> 00:54:29,914
Scott: and the business guy is just like get it done Right.

773
00:54:30,034 --> 00:54:31,020
Scott: do they do this?

774
00:54:31,241 --> 00:54:32,589
Rym: business guy types like?

775
00:54:33,110 --> 00:54:40,390
Rym: Ceos typed for real in that era and many still they were people who made this game did an amazing job.

776
00:54:41,171 --> 00:54:43,176
Scott: They are really masters.

777
00:54:43,678 --> 00:54:46,625
Rym: Yeah, and the game also has a nice good meta commentary.

778
00:54:46,645 --> 00:54:51,681
Rym: like the very first task you get is They tell you about this character and they're like there's.

779
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:54,450
Rym: there's effectively like copyright claims about this character.

780
00:54:54,610 --> 00:55:02,388
Rym: So bad like go ban anyone and delete anyone who's using this character without permission from this company And it's this ugly goldfish thing.

781
00:55:03,071 --> 00:55:23,054
Rym: So uh start poking around and of course the first thing you're gonna find is this like six year old girl's fan page with the fan Art she drew and you feel real bad about it as you delete her page and get her in trouble Mmm, like that's the kind of stuff this game makes you do or ask you to do and maybe you approach the problem a different Way, and there's.

782
00:55:23,276 --> 00:55:30,884
Rym: there's a lot of paths to solve problems Mm-hmm, and it's hard to say more without spoiling things like.

783
00:55:30,904 --> 00:55:31,827
Rym: the game's not that long.

784
00:55:32,027 --> 00:55:43,470
Rym: It'll take you Five or six hours to beat it Seeing most of the fun stuff along the way Maybe like seven or eight hours if you like really poke around and like dig into side quests.

785
00:55:44,093 --> 00:55:46,382
Rym: I can't imagine this game being more than ten hours long.

786
00:55:46,483 --> 00:55:48,149
Rym: Even if you like read every page.

787
00:55:49,972 --> 00:55:52,810
Scott: Yeah, I know if you just want to beat the game it will not take you long at all.

788
00:55:52,951 --> 00:56:01,710
Scott: in fact, there was a speedrun of it at the Previous GDQ that I think was like they found out it was a world record like after the fact.

789
00:56:01,931 --> 00:56:03,402
Rym: Oh someone in the chat's already like gums.

790
00:56:03,422 --> 00:56:04,550
Rym: Your grouper is not ugly.

791
00:56:07,641 --> 00:56:08,849
Scott: Yeah, it does not take.

792
00:56:10,974 --> 00:56:13,810
Scott: You know, it doesn't take long if you just want to beat the game.

793
00:56:14,051 --> 00:56:33,070
Scott: but if you want to explore deeply all the content and like really read everything and and you know Scan everything and dig deep and find secret stuff then you can spend quite a bit of time with this You know and you can always go back to it and I think they added more to it since I've played it So I might I might go back to it and have another look and just enjoy.

794
00:56:33,210 --> 00:56:35,478
Scott: You know the various songs.

795
00:56:35,518 --> 00:56:40,161
Rym: when I got it what I what I found a site that had pirated music And I went to it.

796
00:56:40,566 --> 00:56:52,834
Rym: it looked like Exactly, like the website I used to download mp3s from before Napster and when I clicked on a song it was a broken Fucking link.

797
00:56:53,537 --> 00:56:56,549
Rym: all of the links were broken just like it was back in the day.

798
00:56:57,524 --> 00:57:00,336
Rym: Yep You should like.

799
00:57:00,376 --> 00:57:06,230
Rym: this game is a I would say like if you were Enthusiast of interesting game experiences like you should play this game.

800
00:57:06,491 --> 00:57:10,030
Rym: Do not think this game is only for people who are nostalgic for this era.

801
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:12,743
Rym: That is the opposite of true this game.

802
00:57:12,823 --> 00:57:17,950
Rym: No, we'll let you are Yeah, like this game will let you experience that era in a very true way.

803
00:57:18,972 --> 00:57:25,938
Scott: I think pretty much anyone who is a person of the internet is a person who will enjoy This even if you're not a person of games, right?

804
00:57:26,078 --> 00:57:32,937
Scott: Yeah, I think this is this is really just an entertaining piece of software for any Internet II person.

805
00:57:33,419 --> 00:57:37,216
Scott: right a person who engages online Right will enjoy this.

806
00:57:37,256 --> 00:57:41,110
Scott: a person who doesn't understand internet and is you know, not an you know.

807
00:57:41,150 --> 00:57:45,110
Scott: A person who like reads tweets or you know does any internet communities?

808
00:57:45,690 --> 00:57:50,290
Scott: I can imagine you might have a hard time like connecting with what this, you know game is saying.

809
00:57:50,499 --> 00:57:56,827
Rym: Yeah I can imagine like a pre internet person like someone who grew up before the internet existed.

810
00:57:56,867 --> 00:58:01,018
Scott: right nothing to do with like Computer skills, you'd be very good at computers and just not.

811
00:58:01,078 --> 00:58:04,307
Scott: a person who like socializes online or engages in.

812
00:58:04,327 --> 00:58:10,550
Rym: you know internet You know like you got to get into the mind of a 13 year old punk kid to solve some of these puzzles.

813
00:58:10,791 --> 00:58:11,533
Rym: Right, right.

814
00:58:11,553 --> 00:58:21,309

815
00:58:22,412 --> 00:58:26,310
Scott: This game might not you know ring anything for you, right?

816
00:58:26,631 --> 00:58:41,130
Rym: I guess the last thing I'll say is that the one of the things I really appreciate is that the game the only way to learn how to play this game is to start playing it and you have to run like the Tutorial software in the game on your game computer and it is identical to the tutorial software.

817
00:58:41,271 --> 00:58:46,849
Rym: I had to run for a lot of things in school through much of my childhood Right down to the CG animation of going through a door.

818
00:58:47,881 --> 00:58:49,652
