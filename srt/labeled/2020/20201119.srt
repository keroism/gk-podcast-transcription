1
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,288
Rym: It's Thursday, November 19th, 2020.

2
00:00:09,288 --> 00:00:09,449
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,883 --> 00:00:13,319
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,327
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight.

5
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:18,420
Rym: We are talking about hoodies and possibly jackets.

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:20,878
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:23,441 --> 00:00:28,560
Rym: So, uh, we actually planned to do this show a couple weeks ago, but I had a thing come up and we bailed on the show.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,260
Rym: But then, just a couple days ago, it got cold, so it's actually more topical now than it was two weeks ago.

9
00:00:36,345 --> 00:00:36,473
Scott: Sure.

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:37,350
Scott: Brr.

11
00:00:37,806 --> 00:00:39,240
Rym: Yeah, it's, uh- It's cold.

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,659
Rym: Yeah, it was cold enough where I actually had to go around and, like, turn up the heat in all the different rooms.

13
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:51,800
Scott: All the heaters are now on, but I have the heaters set to, like, 68, which is, like, what's recommended or whatever, so they don't turn on that much.

14
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:58,239
Rym: Yeah, mine are in, because there's three zones and they're three independent units, but- We got three independent units, yeah.

15
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:03,276
Rym: The number that it shows, like, the number on that thermostat does not line up to a real temperature.

16
00:01:03,317 --> 00:01:04,340
Rym: It's basically just relative.

17
00:01:05,101 --> 00:01:12,500
Rym: Like, it is a temperature number, but because of where the sensors are, they're all, like, accurate to themselves.

18
00:01:12,621 --> 00:01:15,539
Rym: Like, they're consistent, but they're not consistent among each other.

19
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,501
Rym: So, I have one set to, like, 74, one set to, like, 68, and one set to 70.

20
00:01:20,501 --> 00:01:22,166
Scott: Well, I mean, it seems fine in here.

21
00:01:22,186 --> 00:01:23,310
Scott: The apartment's well insulated.

22
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:26,180
Scott: When the sun shines in, it gets really warm, even if the heaters aren't on.

23
00:01:27,101 --> 00:01:33,560
Scott: You know, it's like, you know, we're definitely not- it never gets so cold in here that, like, we're like, "Bird, turn up the heat," right?

24
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,420
Scott: You know, we just put on a hoodie or a blanket or whatever.

25
00:01:37,061 --> 00:01:46,900
Rym: I mean, I'll admit, I like to be in shorts and t-shirt in my entire life, and I like my home to be that warm, which, thankfully, in New York, doesn't really cost anything.

26
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,540
Rym: Even if I turn the heat off, it's usually short and t-shirt weather inside of our apartment.

27
00:01:55,185 --> 00:02:03,040
Scott: Okay, so, we had a hard time coming up with any news today, so let me geek-bite this thing, because whatever.

28
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:10,900
Rym: I got a similar thing, because there's no news, really, except the coup attempt and COVID and the hurricanes.

29
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,977
Scott: Alright, so, Mario, Super Mario, not the any other Mario that you might be thinking of, is 35 years old.

30
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,160
Rym: I'm just thinking of regular Giuseppe.

31
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:25,900
Scott: Yeah, so, one of the things they did is they released this Mario Brothers Game & Watch, right?

32
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,560
Scott: So, it's like, it's a Game & Watch, just like the old Game & Watches.

33
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:37,720
Scott: The only difference, obviously, is that the form factor is the same, but the battery is USB-C, rechargeable battery.

34
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,180
Rym: Yeah, not like what AAA's or whatever went in the original Game & Watch.

35
00:02:41,721 --> 00:02:44,749
Scott: No, and the screen is vastly superior.

36
00:02:44,869 --> 00:02:49,360
Scott: It is, you know, the right resolution to play Mario 1 on, right?

37
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:58,560
Scott: So, and it has Mario 1, Mario 2, and Ball, but when you play Ball, Ball is the, you know, the old Game & Watch ball game, right?

38
00:02:59,421 --> 00:03:02,451
Scott: When you play Ball, Mario's head is on the guy, it's not Mr.

39
00:03:02,491 --> 00:03:03,154
Scott: Game & Watch.

40
00:03:03,174 --> 00:03:03,414
Scott: It's Mr.

41
00:03:03,455 --> 00:03:05,060
Scott: Game & Watch's body with Mario's head.

42
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,880
Rym: Wait, wait, it's only Ball, so I can't play Flagman or Manhole or Octopus?

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,746
Scott: They are not on this, no.

44
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:19,220
Scott: The Mario 2 is the real Mario 2, it's not, you know, US Mario to Doki Doki Panic.

45
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:22,025
Scott: It's actual, you know, Mario 2.

46
00:03:22,025 --> 00:03:22,820
Rym: The Lost Levels!

47
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,279
Scott: Yeah, supposedly Lost Levels.

48
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:33,900
Rym: Of course, depending on which Game & Watch, the originals took those little tiny dime-licking cells of varying types.

49
00:03:34,321 --> 00:03:36,850
Scott: Well, people don't realize, it's like, why is it called Game & Watch?

50
00:03:36,871 --> 00:03:39,460
Scott: 'Cause it's a game and it's also a timepiece, right?

51
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:43,972
Scott: And so is the case with this anniversary device.

52
00:03:43,992 --> 00:03:44,834
Scott: So who is this for?

53
00:03:44,954 --> 00:03:46,760
Scott: At 50 bucks, it's not for a lot of people.

54
00:03:49,261 --> 00:03:54,860
Scott: It's for people who, A, want to keep it sealed in the box and never open it and have some kind of collector's thing, right?

55
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,016
Scott: I don't know how much of a collector's thing it's gonna be, 'cause I think it's readily available.

56
00:03:59,076 --> 00:04:00,100
Rym: It's not sold out or anything.

57
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,240
Rym: Ah, it is sold out everywhere I checked.

58
00:04:02,062 --> 00:04:02,484
Scott: Oh, really?

59
00:04:02,504 --> 00:04:02,986
Scott: Oh, okay.

60
00:04:03,087 --> 00:04:04,554
Scott: Well, I just ordered one, like...

61
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,407
Rym: Nintendo is officially out of stock.

62
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:09,014
Rym: I'm poking around to see if I can get one anywhere else.

63
00:04:09,074 --> 00:04:10,159
Rym: Not that I'm gonna get one, but...

64
00:04:10,681 --> 00:04:11,725
Scott: It just showed up.

65
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:14,355
Scott: I ordered it, like, you know, I didn't order it way in advance or anything.

66
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:15,700
Scott: I ordered it, like, you know, a few months ago.

67
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,540
Rym: I think it sold out post-release, but, like, not that quickly.

68
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:35,800
Scott: Anyway, it's for someone who does not have any sort of portable... It's like, if you have a phone, I guess it's like... I guess if you don't have any Game Boys or anything and you just want to play, like, Mario and that's it, it's, like, I don't know.

69
00:04:36,321 --> 00:04:38,247
Scott: It's really not that great to play Mario on.

70
00:04:38,267 --> 00:04:42,140
Scott: The controls are not the greatest, even though, I mean, the buttons themselves are great.

71
00:04:42,642 --> 00:04:47,000
Scott: It's just the form factor of a rectangle is not pleasant to hold, right?

72
00:04:47,761 --> 00:04:58,160
Scott: The screen is pretty impressive color-wise and brightness-wise for such a tiny device, especially at this resolution, you know, the resolution of an NES.

73
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:06,314
Scott: But the refresh rate is pretty good considering, but you can see ghosting, like, behind Mario a little bit.

74
00:05:06,394 --> 00:05:09,460
Scott: It's not... I don't think it's 60 FPS on this screen.

75
00:05:12,001 --> 00:05:16,980
Scott: So what I'm actually using it for is not to play Mario so much, but more, like, the watch part.

76
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:24,660
Scott: So if you try to use it as a watch or, like, a desk clock or a nightstand clock, it doesn't have any alarm feature.

77
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,537
Scott: It's just showing you the time and that's it.

78
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:36,939
Rym: I feel like this is the kind of thing you either put on your desk at work or, like, leave in a waiting room for people to poke at or on a coffee table for people to poke at.

79
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:37,781
Scott: Exactly.

80
00:05:37,822 --> 00:05:39,125
Scott: It's pretty good as a desk clock.

81
00:05:39,165 --> 00:05:50,680
Scott: So the thing is, if you don't have it plugged into USB all the time, it'll just eventually... You'll see this surprisingly high resolution image of, like, Mario taking a nap and then it will turn off.

82
00:05:51,301 --> 00:05:55,500
Scott: So you have to keep the USB-C plugged in at all times for the clock to keep going.

83
00:05:56,261 --> 00:06:02,500
Scott: But if you do, it's actually a very nice clock because, like, basically Mario is, like, constantly doing stuff.

84
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,634
Scott: He, like, hits his head on the numbers to change them.

85
00:06:04,674 --> 00:06:05,420
Scott: They're made out of bricks.

86
00:06:06,361 --> 00:06:07,664
Scott: You can change the scenery.

87
00:06:08,526 --> 00:06:14,200
Scott: Occasionally he'll, like, go into a water level or fight a Bowser just, like, randomly and do all sorts of cute stuff.

88
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,165
Scott: It's, like, stuff is happening, right?

89
00:06:16,687 --> 00:06:20,960
Scott: So it's pretty, you know, it's not boring to have it there, you know?

90
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,991
Scott: It's, like, a really interesting timepiece.

91
00:06:24,011 --> 00:06:26,200
Scott: I guess you could just write a piece of software that does this.

92
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,419
Scott: It's like a screensaver with a clock on it, kind of.

93
00:06:29,601 --> 00:06:31,227
Rym: I guess I stand by.

94
00:06:31,247 --> 00:06:34,500
Rym: This is something you put on your desk at work and every now and then you kind of fiddle with.

95
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,919
Rym: Or someone's, like, coming over to talk to you and they pick it up and fiddle with it.

96
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,340
Scott: Yeah, I think it also has great potential as if somebody is good at hardware hacking.

97
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:47,120
Scott: You could, you know, perhaps... I'm pretty sure it's just a ROM and whatever in there.

98
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:52,800
Scott: So you could easily, if you can get this to run any other program, suddenly it becomes very interesting.

99
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,380
Scott: So hardware hacky type people should be all over this if you can get one.

100
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:02,173
Rym: The pro move would be to steal someone else's, hack it to add creepypasta.

101
00:07:02,193 --> 00:07:05,020
Rym: that'll happen occasionally on the clock screen, and then put it back.

102
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,770
Scott: Creepypasta does happen on the clock screen, normally.

103
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:11,279
Scott: So it's, like, you'll be, like, "What just happened?

104
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:11,440
Scott: What?".

105
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,268
Scott: And also the background behind Mario.

106
00:07:13,288 --> 00:07:14,152
Scott: It's, like, during the day.

107
00:07:14,172 --> 00:07:16,100
Scott: it's just the normal Mario background color.

108
00:07:16,681 --> 00:07:21,040
Scott: But actually it's, like, it fades like it's the sun sets and then it rises in the morning.

109
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,420
Rym: Now I kind of want one, but they're sold out everywhere.

110
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,204
Scott: Alright, well, I got one.

111
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:29,420
Scott: I ordered it, like, less than a week ago and it showed up, like, the next day.

112
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,420
Scott: I think I ordered it last Friday and it showed up Saturday.

113
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,103
Rym: Oh, not too bad.

114
00:07:34,123 --> 00:07:34,967
Rym: I guess it sold out.

115
00:07:35,067 --> 00:07:36,714
Rym: I guess it came out, people were, like, "Oh, it

116
00:07:36,754 --> 00:07:37,076
Rym: exists!"

117
00:07:37,136 --> 00:07:37,960
Rym: and then it sold out.

118
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,836
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know, if I didn't get one, I'd have been, like,

119
00:07:40,876 --> 00:07:41,138
Scott: "Whatev.".

120
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,699
Scott: Yeah, that's kind of how I feel.

121
00:07:43,681 --> 00:07:43,948
Scott: It's, like,

122
00:07:43,968 --> 00:07:44,152
Scott: "Whatev.".

123
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:49,300
Rym: I mean, looking at my desk right now, I have two different identical smartphones just sitting here.

124
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,680
Scott: Yeah, I just sort of bought it on a whim, like, "Alright, whatev," you know.

125
00:07:53,561 --> 00:07:56,680
Rym: I've spent more money on dumber things before and this thing's actually pretty cool.

126
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,113
Scott: I've been using it as a clock for, like, a couple days now.

127
00:07:59,153 --> 00:07:59,978
Scott: It's kind of nice, actually.

128
00:08:01,701 --> 00:08:02,989
Scott: You don't want to turn the noise on.

129
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,660
Scott: You can control the sound and the brightness.

130
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:14,019
Scott: You don't want the sound on when it's in clock mode, at least not all the time, because it makes noises constantly, like tick, tick, tick, like doot, doot, doot.

131
00:08:14,501 --> 00:08:15,397
Scott: It's annoying.

132
00:08:16,421 --> 00:08:22,960
Scott: It's fine if you're just, like, pulling it out of your pocket to check the time, but it's not fine if you've got it on all the time, like on your desk.

133
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,326
Rym: So I bought something not on a whim.

134
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:32,539
Rym: I put myself on the mailing list for this a long time ago, and I finally, it chewed through the queue.

135
00:08:33,061 --> 00:08:37,299
Rym: I'm sure this means that version two of this is going to come out, like, right after I get it, but whatever.

136
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:42,600
Rym: So I'm finally going to get a Valve Index because I'm kind of going, like, I'm diving deep into VR.

137
00:08:43,042 --> 00:08:46,600
Rym: I'm not going to get into, like, the games I'm going to play with it or anything because that's more of a Tuesday thing.

138
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,135
Scott: All two of them.

139
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,201
Rym: There's more.

140
00:08:48,221 --> 00:08:58,840
Rym: There's actually, Star Wars Squadrons is, don't buy VR just for Star Wars Squadrons, obviously, but Star Wars Squadrons is great in VR.

141
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:07,559
Rym: If you can name, like, four other VR games you want to play, then low-end, like mid-tier consumer VR, probably worth it for you.

142
00:09:08,402 --> 00:09:13,920
Rym: But one, I want to develop in VR, and two, I want to try more esoteric and interesting experiences.

143
00:09:14,601 --> 00:09:21,580
Rym: And I want to get away from the Facebook ecosystem because they basically said that all Oculus devices will be garbage within a couple of years.

144
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,320
Rym: We've talked about that before.

145
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:29,840
Rym: So I figured I got to plan to get off of Oculus before that all breaks because I'm never going to make a Facebook account.

146
00:09:31,581 --> 00:09:38,360
Rym: So now I'm going to put the index, which I just got the notification that I'm allowed to buy it, so I bought it.

147
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,119
Rym: It hasn't shipped yet.

148
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:45,420
Rym: I think it'll arrive next weekend or maybe, like, Is it just they can't make enough to meet demand?

149
00:09:45,781 --> 00:09:47,000
Rym: Yeah, they just can't make enough to meet demand.

150
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,519
Scott: I can't imagine demand is that high.

151
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,559
Scott: They must not be able to make that many.

152
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:56,356
Rym: Basically, what you do is if you try to buy it on Steam, it'll say, "Okay, here's the deal.

153
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:57,480
Rym: We'll put you in the queue.

154
00:09:58,023 --> 00:09:59,069
Rym: It's just a stacked queue.

155
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:00,638
Rym: We just chew through the queue as fast as we

156
00:10:00,658 --> 00:10:00,859
Rym: can.".

157
00:10:01,382 --> 00:10:04,599
Rym: When your number comes up, we're not just going to charge you and ship it.

158
00:10:05,101 --> 00:10:09,499
Rym: We're going to email you and give you a week to decide if you actually still want it.

159
00:10:10,501 --> 00:10:13,720
Scott: Why don't they do this for pre-orders of everything in the world?

160
00:10:14,304 --> 00:10:14,649
Rym: Why not?

161
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,380
Rym: Can you imagine?

162
00:10:16,904 --> 00:10:18,560
Scott: They should do this for tickets to concerts.

163
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,988
Rym: They should do it for a 3080.

164
00:10:19,988 --> 00:10:22,580
Rym: I should be able to just get in a queue for a 3080.

165
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:22,644
Rym: PS5s.

166
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:27,394
Rym: EVGA just emails me and they're like, "Yo, dog, you still want that 3080?

167
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:28,497
Rym: Click here and it's

168
00:10:28,578 --> 00:10:28,899
Rym: yours.".

169
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,632
Scott: That's a little different because you have several manufacturers.

170
00:10:31,652 --> 00:10:32,557
Scott: There isn't just one product.

171
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,840
Scott: But they could each do their pre-orders in this fashion and you could get on all the queues.

172
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,477
Scott: And then the first one you buy and the rest of them you say no.

173
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,541
Rym: Exactly.

174
00:10:41,902 --> 00:10:46,234
Rym: But it helps the scalpers because it's easier then to control.

175
00:10:46,475 --> 00:10:48,320
Rym: one Steam account, one thing.

176
00:10:48,662 --> 00:10:50,198
Rym: That's another reason why Valve can do this.

177
00:10:51,205 --> 00:10:51,880
Scott: That's also true.

178
00:10:52,703 --> 00:10:54,571
Rym: The problem is now I'm going to get this thing.

179
00:10:54,692 --> 00:10:55,596
Rym: I can use it with my 1080.

180
00:10:55,596 --> 00:10:55,977
Rym: It'll be fine.

181
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:59,351
Rym: It is way better than my Oculus Rift.

182
00:10:59,431 --> 00:11:00,496
Rym: Everything about it is better.

183
00:11:00,516 --> 00:11:01,520
Rym: It'll work better.

184
00:11:01,821 --> 00:11:03,554
Rym: It'll work directly natively with Steam.

185
00:11:03,594 --> 00:11:04,340
Rym: so I can just uninstall.

186
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,160
Scott: I guess you'll find out if it's better on paper.

187
00:11:07,781 --> 00:11:09,344
Rym: No, I've used one before.

188
00:11:09,805 --> 00:11:17,780
Rym: It is literally the best VR you can possibly get without going into non-consumer hardware.

189
00:11:19,481 --> 00:11:22,312
Rym: The refresh rate, the max refresh rate is 144 which is pretty crazy for VR.

190
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,346
Rym: The resolution is nuts.

191
00:11:26,949 --> 00:11:27,872
Rym: It is an experience.

192
00:11:27,973 --> 00:11:31,205
Rym: It is a boutique, powerful... This is the max.

193
00:11:31,245 --> 00:11:33,980
Rym: This is like the person who got one of the first 4K monitors for VR.

194
00:11:34,681 --> 00:11:35,065
Rym: And it's only $1000.

195
00:11:35,065 --> 00:11:36,599
Rym: It's actually not that bad.

196
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:43,540
Rym: So I'm going to rotate the Oculus Rift, the ancient OG one that I've got, into the living room.

197
00:11:44,142 --> 00:11:48,440
Rym: But I won't be able to use it out there until I get the 3080 because I ain't buying another video card.

198
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,699
Rym: I want to take this 1080 and put it out there in a new HDPC.

199
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,376
Rym: And I can't get a 3080 because scalpers bought them all.

200
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:56,764
Rym: And it is literally scalpers.

201
00:11:56,845 --> 00:12:02,500
Rym: I was poking around online and I could buy a 3080 right now if I was willing to pay double MSRP.

202
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,058
Rym: There's just tons of them.

203
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,666
Scott: Yeah, but it's not the same.

204
00:12:05,806 --> 00:12:08,016
Scott: It's what happens when the supply is low.

205
00:12:08,076 --> 00:12:09,020
Scott: It's not the scalpers fault.

206
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,439
Scott: Scalpers is doing what they do.

207
00:12:10,561 --> 00:12:11,699
Rym: Oh yeah, I make that argument all the time.

208
00:12:12,102 --> 00:12:14,393
Rym: When I yell at kids who are mad like, "What do you mean?

209
00:12:14,473 --> 00:12:15,639
Rym: PAX hotels sold

210
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:15,800
Rym: out?"

211
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,700
Rym: Like, dude, there's only so many hotels in Boston.

212
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,248
Scott: There's only so many 3080s.

213
00:12:21,052 --> 00:12:22,480
Scott: The fab is making them slowly.

214
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:28,580
Rym: But what's interesting is the scalper market has outpaced the consumer market.

215
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:34,098
Rym: There are 3080s just for sale that you could just buy right now.

216
00:12:34,198 --> 00:12:34,700
Rym: Plenty of them.

217
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,336
Rym: I could go buy three or four if I wanted, but I have to pay the markup, which is about 100% right now.

218
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:46,800
Scott: This is the same as why all the sellers are just really dumb and are not responding to market pressure.

219
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,600
Scott: The same reason you have all these vacant storefronts in the city.

220
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,720
Scott: I guess now it makes sense to have people jacking up their rent.

221
00:12:54,061 --> 00:12:59,100
Scott: They'd rather not sell it and set a high price than lower the price until it sells.

222
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:13,540
Rym: Now, the most efficient way to do this, like a 3080, the most efficient market for that could possibly exist for that would be to just they sell them and basically you put in a bid like an exchange limit order book.

223
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,879
Rym: And whoever's willing to pay the most gets the first one.

224
00:13:17,241 --> 00:13:18,387
Scott: Well, this would be something, right?

225
00:13:18,407 --> 00:13:19,814
Scott: So we already have eBay, right?

226
00:13:19,894 --> 00:13:21,140
Scott: eBay exists, right?

227
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:28,380
Scott: What if instead of eBay, we did like collective eBay where everyone, people are either buyers or sellers.

228
00:13:28,481 --> 00:13:30,680
Scott: People have 3080s and people have money, right?

229
00:13:31,001 --> 00:13:37,800
Scott: If you're a buyer, you type in secretly the most amount, the highest amount you are willing to pay for a 3080.

230
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,840
Rym: Scott, that is literally how the equity stock market works.

231
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:41,340
Rym: Yeah.

232
00:13:41,722 --> 00:13:45,094
Scott: And then everyone who's got a 3080 puts in the lowest price.

233
00:13:45,135 --> 00:13:45,897
Scott: they'll sell their 3080 for.

234
00:13:47,181 --> 00:13:50,540
Scott: And then it just swaps 3080s as much as possible.

235
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,220
Rym: And all you do is you take like a 0.1% commission to facilitate each transaction.

236
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:56,261
Scott: Right.

237
00:13:56,543 --> 00:13:59,340
Scott: But no website that does that exists, but it totally could.

238
00:13:59,501 --> 00:13:59,842
Scott: It could.

239
00:14:00,063 --> 00:14:02,373
Rym: That's literally, nothing did that for stocks.

240
00:14:02,473 --> 00:14:03,920
Rym: And then one day someone was like, you know what?

241
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,648
Rym: I'm going to make a stock exchange.

242
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,300
Rym: I'm going to write down everyone's orders on a piece of paper.

243
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,867
Scott: eBay sort of does it, but eBay does it like.

244
00:14:09,928 --> 00:14:12,340
Scott: each seller has to intentionally go and set up a specific auction.

245
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,974
Rym: The key would be, because think about who you're selling this to.

246
00:14:15,014 --> 00:14:16,120
Rym: You sell it to normal people.

247
00:14:16,201 --> 00:14:19,261
Rym: Like I would go in there and type a number because I want a 3080.

248
00:14:19,261 --> 00:14:21,379
Scott: I think the thing is I would also, I would also.

249
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,385
Rym: But you're also selling it to the scalpers.

250
00:14:23,406 --> 00:14:31,420
Rym: You have to get the scalpers to agree to type in their numbers here and sell it to them as look dudes, put in your numbers here.

251
00:14:31,741 --> 00:14:36,140
Rym: And you'll maximize how much you get from your scalping with the real market.

252
00:14:37,161 --> 00:14:41,040
Scott: Well, also with the service that are provided to both peoples, right.

253
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:45,534
Scott: Is I would justify my fees and increased fees.

254
00:14:45,615 --> 00:14:47,200
Scott: In fact, with escrow, right.

255
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,112
Scott: You send me the 3080, you send me the money.

256
00:14:50,233 --> 00:14:52,162
Scott: I verify it's a legit 3080.

257
00:14:52,162 --> 00:14:53,739
Scott: If it's not, I send the money back.

258
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,384
Rym: Guess what?

259
00:14:54,525 --> 00:14:56,418
Rym: Stock exchanges and clearing houses do.

260
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,319
Scott: Did you verify that the shit's legit?

261
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,504
Rym: Yeah, that's exactly like.

262
00:15:00,544 --> 00:15:04,020
Rym: basically you have, it's not always escrow, but there are systems that are very similar.

263
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:11,879
Rym: If I buy stock and you sell stock and we end up transacting with our stock on an exchange, the exchange guarantees that we're both going to actually deliver.

264
00:15:14,162 --> 00:15:15,999
Rym: I'm skipping a lot of steps, but it's basically that.

265
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:26,480
Rym: I feel like something like that will exist someday because there's, even if we have communism, communism is not going to cover like complete luxury goods like a 3080.

266
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:32,480
Scott: Let's just make it and ignore and do what all the Silicon Valley companies do, which is ignore the fact that laws exist until it matters.

267
00:15:32,821 --> 00:15:35,359
Rym: I can't actually imagine anything illegal about this.

268
00:15:36,781 --> 00:15:38,660
Scott: There's no regulation we would have to follow.

269
00:15:38,841 --> 00:15:40,379
Rym: No, it's not illegal to be a scalper.

270
00:15:41,203 --> 00:15:42,240
Rym: You can just fucking scalp.

271
00:15:43,801 --> 00:15:45,179
Scott: Alright, so let's just make this website.

272
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,139
Rym: I'll be the head that to the hopper.

273
00:15:48,722 --> 00:15:49,611
Rym: It's in the hopper now.

274
00:15:49,651 --> 00:15:50,095
Rym: Let's do it.

275
00:15:51,782 --> 00:15:52,330
Rym: We'd start with the 3080s.

276
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,878
Rym: I got to go find a scalper to talk to and be like, hey, would you use this?

277
00:15:58,241 --> 00:16:03,219
Rym: Alright, in some actual like news news, no one should have had to tell you this.

278
00:16:04,081 --> 00:16:07,960
Rym: The news is not that you should do this because that should be obvious.

279
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:09,740
Rym: You should not travel for Thanksgiving.

280
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,700
Rym: Do not travel anywhere to visit people for Thanksgiving.

281
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,000
Rym: There is a global pandemic.

282
00:16:14,462 --> 00:16:18,020
Rym: Good God, do not fly anywhere to see family.

283
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:23,659
Rym: Do not go on a road trip to see people who you're not already quarantining together with.

284
00:16:26,263 --> 00:16:34,700
Rym: If you already close your bubble with someone, like you and another family, mutually exclude the rest of the world, but your kids play together, that's one thing.

285
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,579
Scott: There's a great graphic, guys.

286
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:41,260
Rym: If there's a person... It is hard to do GeekNights on Discord.

287
00:16:42,664 --> 00:16:56,300
Scott: I saw this great graphic that was like the bubble you think you have and the bubble you actually have because it showed how, oh, here's a bunch of people and each person in the Venn diagram has a reasonable bubble of only like five people.

288
00:16:56,981 --> 00:17:04,760
Scott: But all of those bubbles overlap with like one or two people and your actual bubble ends up being like 30 people.

289
00:17:05,741 --> 00:17:14,008
Scott: So, especially on a holiday situation, if you haven't already... Holiday times, especially in the

290
00:17:14,028 --> 00:17:14,249
Scott: U.S.,

291
00:17:14,289 --> 00:17:16,640
Scott: it's like you're going to see the relatives you see less often.

292
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,480
Scott: It's like, no, just see the people.

293
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:22,135
Scott: If you're not seeing the people on a daily frequent basis already, don't go see them.

294
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:43,919
Rym: Especially because when you form a quarantine bubble as opposed to visiting someone for a one-off, most people I think who actually do that and take it seriously do have that conversation of like, all right, how often do you actually like bump into strangers and you both have to make sure you're at the same level of risk or one party in that group is going to be super screwed.

295
00:17:45,402 --> 00:17:48,560
Rym: But like, Uncle Joe, how often do you talk to Uncle Joe?

296
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:51,820
Rym: You sure Uncle Joe isn't just like going to the bar at night?

297
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:52,938
Rym: Do you trust Uncle Joe?

298
00:17:55,224 --> 00:17:57,440
Rym: Did Uncle Joe get drunk at the last four Thanksgivings?

299
00:17:58,223 --> 00:17:59,880
Scott: Well, even not Uncle Joe, right?

300
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:05,240
Scott: It's like, okay, so you and your neighbor and your parents.

301
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,760
Scott: But like, anytime I walk outside, I walk past a doorman.

302
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,879
Rym: So that doorman is not in my bubble.

303
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:11,860
Scott: You're not getting sick from the doorman.

304
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,019
Rym: But I have a contact with that doorman on a regular basis.

305
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,660
Scott: You're not hanging with the doorman long enough to get sick.

306
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,575
Scott: No, but I'm walking past him.

307
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,026
Scott: That doesn't matter.

308
00:18:19,046 --> 00:18:20,360
Scott: You're not going to get sick walking past somebody.

309
00:18:21,424 --> 00:18:22,480
Scott: Not for two seconds, right?

310
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,600
Scott: So you got your neighbors, two people, and you got parents, two people, right?

311
00:18:25,781 --> 00:18:26,123
Scott: Okay.

312
00:18:26,425 --> 00:18:28,336
Scott: Well, your parents have you, right?

313
00:18:28,457 --> 00:18:28,960
Scott: One person.

314
00:18:29,464 --> 00:18:31,079
Scott: And they have their friends.

315
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,480
Scott: Their bubble is also a small little bubble.

316
00:18:34,621 --> 00:18:38,120
Scott: But those friends are in your bubble that you never see, right?

317
00:18:38,521 --> 00:18:40,100
Scott: And then those friends, right?

318
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,560
Scott: Your parents' friends go to see someone on Thanksgiving, right?

319
00:18:43,881 --> 00:18:53,640
Scott: And now suddenly all the people that they saw on Thanksgiving and all the people that they previously saw are now in your little safe bubble to five people with just your parents and your neighbor, right?

320
00:18:53,941 --> 00:19:01,380
Scott: Has now been, you know, gets contact with a whole crap ton of people because their parents' friends went to see someone on Thanksgiving.

321
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:08,720
Rym: Never mind the fact that if someone flies or travels a long distance, that just opens up a whole door.

322
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,660
Scott: That person's got to go into a one-person bubble.

323
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:14,095
Rym: Like, I am not going anywhere near an airplane until like 2022 probably.

324
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,019
Scott: Yeah, definitely not a boat.

325
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,572
Rym: But the news is the CDC in the U.S.

326
00:19:21,074 --> 00:19:23,740
Rym: actually advised Americans to not travel for Thanksgiving.

327
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:34,120
Rym: And that is notable because up until this point, due to our current president and the Republican Party, they basically prevented federal agencies from telling anyone to not do anything.

328
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:39,180
Rym: And it is notable that a federal agency is actually giving people good advice again.

329
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,900
Rym: That is a very good sign about the long-term future of America.

330
00:19:43,461 --> 00:19:51,060
Rym: But I don't think many people are going to take that advice, and I think there's going to be a big shit show about three weeks after Thanksgiving, to be honest.

331
00:19:52,081 --> 00:20:01,180
Scott: Yeah, probably, but at least to just make sure it doesn't happen to -- you know, you can't control what the rest of the people in the ridiculous world we live in are going to do, right?

332
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,340
Scott: There's nothing -- you know, if it happens, it's like it sucks.

333
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,217
Scott: I don't want it to happen.

334
00:20:04,741 --> 00:20:06,210
Scott: But what can we really do to stop it?

335
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,840
Scott: besides tell people good advice?

336
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:08,720
Scott: Not much, right?

337
00:20:09,861 --> 00:20:13,520
Scott: Well, you know, what's important is just worry about your own people.

338
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:20,180
Scott: You know, it's like not because that's a good way to think about the world to be tribal and selfish, right?

339
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:29,711
Scott: You should care for all the people, but, you know, when it comes to action, you've got to accept that you can't do anything for the other people, even though you might want to, or there's little you can do.

340
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:38,180
Rym: Like, I was out walking the other night, and I walked past a bar or a restaurant that was open and had indoor dining, and there were a shit ton of people in there.

341
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,079
Rym: There's nothing I can do about those people.

342
00:20:41,003 --> 00:20:41,205
Scott: Nope.

343
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:42,580
Rym: Just stay away from them.

344
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,458
Rym: Other than avoid them.

345
00:20:44,391 --> 00:20:44,499
Scott: Right.

346
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:54,359
Rym: So last thing, I've been kind of, when I'm exercising, working my way through the original Unsolved Mysteries, because it's all just free on YouTube.

347
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,004
Scott: You can watch anything.

348
00:20:56,024 --> 00:21:07,456
Scott: You have access to all the video, audio, book content in the history, you know, and you choose, of all the things, to watch some garbo TV show from the '80s, '90s.

349
00:21:08,621 --> 00:21:20,840
Rym: I'm not watching every episode, and I'm skipping all the boring ones, but basically I'm watching all the, like, UFO bullshit ones that are, like, ghost nonsense, because they're actually, as an adult, I have not seen most of these since I was a kid.

350
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,856
Rym: They're actually really, really, really funny, if you're an adult, watching a lot of them.

351
00:21:29,225 --> 00:21:29,960
Rym: I'm sure they are.

352
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:39,520
Rym: And people have been bugging me about this, because a lot of people know I'm watching Unsolved Mysteries again, and I have a lot of feelings about that show, that there is a new, like, a reboot of Unsolved Mysteries that's on Netflix.

353
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:57,460
Rym: But it's actually, I have not watched it yet, but a lot of people have been telling me that it is kind of, like, serious, like, it's more like a real documentary, and that they are earnestly presenting cases where they believe the public could help solve this crime, or bring someone to justice, or save somebody.

354
00:21:57,962 --> 00:22:06,860
Rym: And it seems like it's actually, it might be kind of like the original show, where, for all the ghost nonsense, they actually did solve a lot of crimes, for real, with people calling in tips.

355
00:22:08,543 --> 00:22:17,786
Scott: I also wonder, though, is, like, a lot of those, especially the crime ones, it's like, if you're not local to where that crime was, it's like, you can't, what are the odds?

356
00:22:17,806 --> 00:22:18,511
Scott: you can help, right?

357
00:22:18,531 --> 00:22:23,040
Scott: You're so... Unless you recognize a person who moved to your neighborhood recently.

358
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,306
Rym: A lot of them were that.

359
00:22:24,447 --> 00:22:34,797
Rym: Someone was, like, on the lam after a murder, like, and the phone call was someone in a different state who, like, recognized the person under a different name coming to their golf club, or some crap like that.

360
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:45,179
Rym: But in this case, this news came by, just while I was looking for news today, because I didn't really want to talk about the coup attempt, or the global pandemic, or any of that nonsense too much.

361
00:22:46,120 --> 00:23:00,486
Rym: And not only is the Netflix show apparently, like, legit like this, the new one, but they're actually even, like, right now, there are updates on cases they have covered in the new show, and they're asking the public for more information, and the police are following up.

362
00:23:00,566 --> 00:23:03,460
Rym: Like, it seems to be making progress on some cases.

363
00:23:03,824 --> 00:23:04,838
Rym: So I'm going to link to one of those.

364
00:23:06,321 --> 00:23:08,038
Rym: Like, they're asking about all these people who went to some party.

365
00:23:08,461 --> 00:23:12,600
Scott: These are, like, things that the police should be doing, and not, you know, harassing.

366
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:23,380
Rym: Oh yeah, it's almost like we need to completely re-envision what the concept of police is, because right now, if I call the police because someone stole my bike, they're not going to do shit.

367
00:23:29,401 --> 00:23:32,197
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

368
00:23:32,217 --> 00:23:32,660
Rym: What do you got?

369
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:34,726
Scott: What do I have?

370
00:23:34,786 --> 00:23:36,800
Scott: So I think I used them as a thing of the day before.

371
00:23:37,861 --> 00:23:42,778
Scott: There is an amazing musical group from Korea, of course, known as Norazo.

372
00:23:44,842 --> 00:23:51,699
Scott: They did a song that, I mean, they've done a lot of songs, but the first song I saw from them, I think, was the cider song.

373
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:57,217
Scott: In Korea, I think they refer to Sprite as cider, right?

374
00:23:57,257 --> 00:23:58,060
Scott: C-I-D, whatever.

375
00:23:59,361 --> 00:24:04,840
Scott: And then they also had the shower song, and today they have released the bread song.

376
00:24:05,961 --> 00:24:12,280
Scott: The music video is kind of amazing, I think because of the restrictions due to the pandemic and such.

377
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:16,059
Scott: They want to release a music video, but you've got to get a whole crew together, right?

378
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,675
Scott: You've got to get a lot of people in one place to make a music video.

379
00:24:18,695 --> 00:24:19,419
Scott: They don't want to do that.

380
00:24:20,941 --> 00:24:27,554
Scott: It's a lot of work, especially when, you know, I don't think they're making as much money as some of the other major acts out there, right?

381
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,238
Scott: They're mostly making enough money to keep this going, though.

382
00:24:32,122 --> 00:24:41,600
Scott: So the entire music video is green-screened with hilarious CG, and three costumes, and just a couple backup dancers, and that's it.

383
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:53,420
Scott: And it's just like, I think what we're going to be able to tell, looking back, video things-- Who knew production and who didn't when they didn't have all their staff?

384
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,794
Scott: Well, no, you're going to be able to look back and say, "Ah, you see?

385
00:24:55,895 --> 00:24:56,619
Scott: This video is--.

386
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:02,420
Scott: We can tell this video is from 2020, because look at how they tried to reduce how many people were in it," right?

387
00:25:04,662 --> 00:25:07,579
Scott: But yeah, hilarious, excellent video.

388
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:13,340
Rym: Well, wait until there's movies about the year 2020 or set during this whole pandemic.

389
00:25:13,961 --> 00:25:18,100
Rym: Will everyone wear masks in the movie, or will they just not?

390
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:21,380
Rym: Because that would be weird in a movie if the movie wasn't about the pandemic.

391
00:25:22,761 --> 00:25:32,880
Scott: Right, so if you like wacky comedy-type stuff, you know, the sort of ridiculous, eccentric, Eurobeat, high-energy ridiculousness, these are your people.

392
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:38,960
Rym: So this is just a really cute animation by a third-year CalArts student.

393
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,169
Rym: I just tumbled onto it the other day.

394
00:25:41,209 --> 00:25:42,440
Rym: It's actually a YouTube video from 2013.

395
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:42,783
Scott: From what year?

396
00:25:42,804 --> 00:25:44,157
Scott: Does it have a year on it?

397
00:25:44,198 --> 00:25:44,420
Scott: Oh, old, okay.

398
00:25:44,681 --> 00:25:46,294
Rym: It's old, but I've just never seen it until recently.

399
00:25:46,314 --> 00:25:47,020
Rym: It's called Moon Goddess.

400
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,704
Rym: It's the story of Aphrodite.

401
00:25:49,689 --> 00:25:53,450
Rym: You know the story where dude accidentally sees her naked and she turns him into a deer?

402
00:25:54,258 --> 00:25:54,460
Scott: Yes.

403
00:25:54,721 --> 00:26:08,780
Rym: Well, this is a take on that, but dude Aphrodite is just there, or Artemis, Artemis, Artemis is just there being cool, and horny dude shows up being annoying, and Artemis turns horny dude into a deer, and it's cute and funny after that.

404
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,627
Scott: Yeah, I did watch this.

405
00:26:10,667 --> 00:26:11,070
Scott: Yeah, I remember.

406
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:12,017
Rym: Yep, I liked it.

407
00:26:14,121 --> 00:26:14,804
Rym: And the meta moment.

408
00:26:15,266 --> 00:26:18,160
Rym: We are, I haven't read any more Tales of Genji.

409
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,979
Rym: I have not gotten past the point where I read two previously yet.

410
00:26:22,001 --> 00:26:22,744
Scott: I also have not.

411
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:28,149
Rym: It's a game of chicken on which one of us gets to a new page first, thus triggering the apocalypse.

412
00:26:29,035 --> 00:26:29,437
Scott: Mm-hmm.

413
00:26:30,561 --> 00:26:39,440
Rym: New code of conduct, there's conventions, the MagFest virtual convention was announced, so I assume we're going to be taking part in that in some fashion.

414
00:26:40,185 --> 00:26:42,117
Scott: Oh, I hadn't thought of that, but I guess that will happen.

415
00:26:42,137 --> 00:26:42,238
Scott: Yeah.

416
00:26:42,821 --> 00:26:43,547
Rym: Yeah, stay tuned.

417
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:45,039
Rym: There's going to be a VR Gaylord.

418
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:45,685
Scott: I was thinking about it.

419
00:26:45,705 --> 00:26:47,080
Scott: I was just like, oh, I guess I'll go to that.

420
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,238
Scott: It's like, oh wait, no, I probably have to do a panel edit.

421
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,420
Rym: Yeah, we're going to have to set up all our ridiculous nonsense and do a panel again.

422
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:54,580
Scott: No.

423
00:26:54,922 --> 00:27:10,349
Rym: Hey, at least we put all the hard work in, we know how to do it, and we've gotten through the growing pains of, let me tell you, it is really fucking hard to record a panel the style of how Rym and Scott normally do panels when we're not in the same room.

424
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:12,280
Rym: I cannot stress enough.

425
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,780
Scott: I guess the cold is going to make outside not an option.

426
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:15,302
Rym: I know.

427
00:27:15,322 --> 00:27:20,657
Rym: We never even got to the point of doing outside as much as we wanted to because it was also a pain in the ass.

428
00:27:22,283 --> 00:27:24,020
Rym: So we're going to have to go through this one more time.

429
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:29,720
Rym: I feel like I want to try to structure the kinds of panels we do to be more conducive to this environment.

430
00:27:31,302 --> 00:27:34,838
Rym: I don't know what that means or what that looks like, but we'll figure something out.

431
00:27:36,301 --> 00:27:40,879
Rym: Otherwise, there's a lot of post-processing and a lot of false starts and a lot of talking over each other that I got to edit out.

432
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,049
Rym: So it's perfect time to talk about this.

433
00:27:43,189 --> 00:27:47,458
Rym: It is now officially hoodie weather, though it's rapidly approaching full winter coat weather.

434
00:27:49,242 --> 00:27:51,939
Rym: But it's still at the point where if I go outside, all I got to put on is a hoodie.

435
00:27:53,284 --> 00:27:54,299
Rym: It's not that cold yet.

436
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,760
Rym: And we've done a lot of shows on clothes over the years.

437
00:27:58,521 --> 00:28:00,530
Rym: Clothes and Food are two of our go-to.

438
00:28:01,294 --> 00:28:06,378
Rym: what are we going to do on Thursday, look around the room, think about a food we've eaten recently and do a whole show on it.

439
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,600
Rym: But hoodies, actually, I think a lot about hoodies.

440
00:28:10,881 --> 00:28:11,828
Rym: I own a lot of hoodies now.

441
00:28:11,868 --> 00:28:13,300
Rym: I got a lot to say about hoodies, I think.

442
00:28:13,861 --> 00:28:17,000
Rym: And we'll get into jackets if we run out of steam on hoodies somehow.

443
00:28:17,603 --> 00:28:18,952
Scott: I don't think we'll run out of steam on hoodies.

444
00:28:18,973 --> 00:28:20,080
Scott: There's a lot to say about hoodies.

445
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,118
Rym: There is a lot to say about hoodies.

446
00:28:21,761 --> 00:28:30,617
Scott: I was watching some videos on YouTube even before we decided on this episode about the history of hoodies, and it was going way back to monks.

447
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,599
Scott: You think about a monk wearing a cloak with a hood.

448
00:28:36,122 --> 00:28:39,900
Scott: And it's showing basically the history of hooded garments, which are basically all hoodies.

449
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:45,880
Scott: They're just different manufacturing methods, different materials and such over time.

450
00:28:46,863 --> 00:28:51,920
Scott: And what we think of today is the champion hoodie made out of cotton jersey.

451
00:28:52,841 --> 00:28:56,459
Rym: We think of hoodies, they're usually a pullover or a zip-up.

452
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,800
Rym: They got a hood, they got two pockets to the side.

453
00:28:59,881 --> 00:29:00,905
Scott: It's a newer garment.

454
00:29:00,965 --> 00:29:10,180
Scott: It's not that old on its own, but the hood in general, the hooded jacket of some kind, goes way further back.

455
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,590
Scott: And they're all related.

456
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:12,678
Scott: They're all the same thing.

457
00:29:14,905 --> 00:29:18,640
Scott: And if you're a fashion historian, I guess there's a such thing as that.

458
00:29:19,983 --> 00:29:22,900
Scott: There's probably tons of history about every kind of garment.

459
00:29:24,421 --> 00:29:40,780
Scott: But the hoodie in particular is just really fascinating in what it means culturally, practically, the different scenarios in which you wear it, places you've seen it that are significant.

460
00:29:43,783 --> 00:29:47,400
Scott: And the signals that it sends and how that's changed over time.

461
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,659
Scott: The types of people who would wear it.

462
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:55,734
Rym: Scrolling through this Wikipedia, it shows a picture from the 70s of people wearing actually modern looking hoodies.

463
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,232
Rym: But that's on the front page of this Wikipedia article.

464
00:30:01,101 --> 00:30:03,032
Rym: Because the 70s, they weren't that common yet.

465
00:30:03,393 --> 00:30:04,580
Rym: At least not the way they were later.

466
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:11,499
Rym: But you also see the UK, they have a whole section on bars banning them, getting into the cultural aspects of hoodies.

467
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:14,914
Rym: We went from a time- Oh great, a picture of the Unabomber.

468
00:30:14,934 --> 00:30:15,318
Rym: Here we go.

469
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,004
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

470
00:30:17,265 --> 00:30:19,096
Scott: So you've got Unabomber wearing a hoodie.

471
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,820
Scott: That's iconic.

472
00:30:21,441 --> 00:30:26,800
Scott: You've seen, what's the movie, Hot Fuzz, right?

473
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,399
Scott: The bad kids in town are like the hoodies.

474
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,129
Scott: It's sort of like wearing a hoodie is sinister.

475
00:30:32,149 --> 00:30:33,755
Scott: It was associated with gang violence.

476
00:30:35,221 --> 00:30:42,500
Rym: It was associated with trying to hide your identity when you needed to, across multiple cultural contexts.

477
00:30:44,306 --> 00:30:45,955
Scott: The hood has so many uses, right?

478
00:30:46,015 --> 00:30:46,980
Scott: Comfort, warmth.

479
00:30:48,261 --> 00:30:52,980
Rym: Like if it's actually cold, a hood on a proper winter jacket is crucial.

480
00:30:56,483 --> 00:31:07,260
Scott: So it went from that, but you've also got like, at least say Silicon Valley CEOs wearing t-shirt and hoodie, as opposed to suit, which all CEOs would wear previously.

481
00:31:08,521 --> 00:31:19,419
Rym: Now it's funny, because when I think about my own life, I never wore hoodies, really, until a few packs is in when I bought that Pax hoodie.

482
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:27,578
Rym: I never liked hoodies, because in fact, I never liked long-sleeved garments of any kind, and I tried to avoid wearing them at all costs for much of my life.

483
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:36,760
Rym: Like I never, as a kid, like up until high school, like after high school, never wore sweaters, like ever, except if you and my mom bought me and kind of pushed me into wearing.

484
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:40,090
Scott: Well, sweaters are a little bit different.

485
00:31:40,351 --> 00:31:44,920
Scott: I avoided sweaters in my youth, because the ones I had were like the itchy wool kind.

486
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,296
Rym: Oh yeah, I had a few of those.

487
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:58,040
Rym: My mom actually made me get all these Abercrombie ones that were pretty fashionable, but I had kid brain, but my idea of fashion was kid brain fashion, so I didn't like all the fashionable things.

488
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,899
Scott: But I eventually came back to sweaters when I got ones that weren't itchy.

489
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,325
Rym: Yeah, but even not itchy.

490
00:32:02,989 --> 00:32:11,180
Rym: My whole life, I hate wearing long sleeves, and only in my like late adulthood do I tolerate wearing long sleeves, except in like extreme temperatures.

491
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,611
Scott: You can cut your sleeves off a hoodie if you want.

492
00:32:12,994 --> 00:32:13,640
Scott: No one's stopping you.

493
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:14,322
Rym: Yeah, good.

494
00:32:14,663 --> 00:32:31,460
Rym: But in high school, middle school, like whenever I needed something warm, like the kind of weather today where I'd like put on a hoodie, in those times, I was one of those kids who would put on a flannel button-down shirt that I did not actually button, and that was what served as my warming garment.

495
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:33,500
Rym: I was a flannel kid.

496
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:38,740
Scott: See, the hoodie, I feel like it's, you know, it's not quite a jacket, and it's not quite a shirt.

497
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:42,760
Scott: It's like, you know, putting on just a plain sweatshirt, you could, right?

498
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:51,960
Scott: But the plain sweatshirt is more of like either a lounge wear, an athletic wear, maybe you're going outside to like rake the leaves or something, you know?

499
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:54,099
Scott: It's sort of like, eh, you know, right?

500
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,880
Scott: Whereas the hoodie is like, I need to be warmer than I am now, right?

501
00:32:59,401 --> 00:33:01,630
Scott: I'm not necessarily like going out.

502
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:04,890
Scott: If I'm going out, right, I'm going to put on a jacket, because I'm going out.

503
00:33:05,276 --> 00:33:05,499
Rym: Outdoors.

504
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,846
Rym: Well, it depends on the weather.

505
00:33:06,866 --> 00:33:10,220
Rym: I generally also avoid, I don't have light jackets.

506
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,440
Rym: I have full jacket, and I have like nothing.

507
00:33:13,681 --> 00:33:19,339
Scott: Sure, but it's like you can put on the jacket, go outside, when you get at your destination, you take off the jacket, put it on a coat rack.

508
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,239
Rym: True, but you keep the hoodie with you.

509
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,880
Scott: Right, then you would, when you leave, right?

510
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:28,280
Scott: So the jacket is just for keeping you warm during that outside transitionary period.

511
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,800
Scott: The hoodie, it's like the hoodie is making you warmer, but you don't take it off.

512
00:33:33,881 --> 00:33:35,254
Scott: It's an indoor/outdoor, right?

513
00:33:36,544 --> 00:33:38,260
Rym: Well, you know where the change was for me?

514
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,078
Scott: I'll even put a jacket on over the hoodie, right?

515
00:33:42,001 --> 00:33:52,760
Scott: It's like, okay, it's a little bit cold inside, but it's like too cold inside to just wear a shirt only, but it's really too cold outside to not wear a jacket.

516
00:33:52,922 --> 00:33:53,940
Scott: You just described MagFest.

517
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,660
Scott: Yeah, so it's like hoodie, then jacket.

518
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,500
Scott: So it's like I get where I'm going, I take off a jacket, but it's still cold.

519
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,771
Scott: It's a little bit cold inside.

520
00:34:00,791 --> 00:34:01,719
Scott: I got the hoodie.

521
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:16,795
Rym: But it was really like it was conventions that got me to start wearing hoodies, primarily because the way I use a hoodie is it is the versatile garment for the variety of conditions I'll run into, primarily at conventions, like tabletop's.

522
00:34:16,815 --> 00:34:20,039
Rym: really cold for some reason, but when I walk out of the main area, it's really warm.

523
00:34:20,522 --> 00:34:22,873
Rym: I can take the hoodie off and like tie it around my waist.

524
00:34:22,955 --> 00:34:23,900
Rym: That's also fashionable.

525
00:34:24,222 --> 00:34:26,659
Rym: If it's really cold, I can pull the hood up and put my hands in the pockets.

526
00:34:27,801 --> 00:34:37,280
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I've always had it like, you know, wherever my office is where I'm working, I always have like a hoodie on the chair at work or a hoodie on the chair at home.

527
00:34:37,841 --> 00:34:43,699
Scott: And it's sort of like, okay, you know, the place that you are frequently, you've just got this hoodie at the ready.

528
00:34:44,161 --> 00:34:47,020
Scott: In case you're cold or whatever, you can just put it on.

529
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:50,800
Scott: Maybe you just need to, you're going to go out, but you're going out quickly.

530
00:34:51,121 --> 00:34:52,085
Scott: Well, the hoodie's right here.

531
00:34:52,206 --> 00:34:58,220
Scott: Grab, go out quickly and then come back in, you know, or maybe it's going to rain, but you're not sure it's going to rain.

532
00:34:58,461 --> 00:35:04,300
Scott: And maybe it's not, if it does rain, it's not going to be like umbrella raincoat rain and you're not going to be out that long.

533
00:35:04,621 --> 00:35:06,191
Scott: You just don't want your head to get that wet.

534
00:35:06,473 --> 00:35:07,560
Scott: So you just need the hoodie hood.

535
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:10,759
Scott: You don't need any other kind of, you know, hood action.

536
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,507
Scott: Maybe it's not that cold.

537
00:35:14,528 --> 00:35:16,740
Scott: You don't need a big heavy jacket, but it's going to be windy.

538
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,291
Scott: You want to keep your ears warm.

539
00:35:18,493 --> 00:35:19,259
Scott: You don't want to wear a hat.

540
00:35:20,801 --> 00:35:20,982
Rym: Yeah.

541
00:35:21,022 --> 00:35:24,140
Rym: The thing is though, the hoodie hoods tend not to be windbreakers.

542
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:30,440
Rym: And if I, if I'm worried about wind, I have a lot of specialized sports jackets and sports gear to cover that sort of thing.

543
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:32,027
Rym: And I'll use those windows again.

544
00:35:32,429 --> 00:35:34,859
Scott: The wind is that severe that you need a specialized gear.

545
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:38,520
Rym: But if it's not that severe, I would just never put anything up on my head in the first place.

546
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:41,173
Rym: Like I almost never pull the hood up on a hoodie like ever.

547
00:35:41,374 --> 00:35:42,339
Scott: No, I use the hood a lot.

548
00:35:43,081 --> 00:35:44,389
Rym: Well, I guess I have a lot of hair.

549
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:45,595
Rym: I basically have a built in hoodie.

550
00:35:48,321 --> 00:35:51,840
Rym: The one thing I hate though, my whole life I have hated pullovers.

551
00:35:52,301 --> 00:36:02,380
Rym: Like I do, I cannot stand a pullover hoodie because the whole point of me wearing a hoodie is that I can take it off and put it on really quickly without like messing up my hair or like any hassle.

552
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,330
Rym: Like I can keep it on zip most of the time.

553
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,940
Rym: I only zip it up if I'm cold.

554
00:36:06,602 --> 00:36:09,779
Rym: If it's a pullover, there's a little more hassle to take it out or put it off.

555
00:36:10,521 --> 00:36:10,621
Scott: Yeah.

556
00:36:10,661 --> 00:36:16,840
Scott: I mean, I don't have hair to worry about, at least not right now, but I still do prefer the zip hoodie to the pullover hoodie.

557
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:22,797
Rym: People in the chat are really talking about their hoodie preferences, but people are talking about these button up hoodies, which I don't think I've ever seen in my life.

558
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,688
Scott: Button up hoodie is kind of weird.

559
00:36:24,748 --> 00:36:26,340
Scott: It's like, it's even harder to put on.

560
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,626
Rym: I mean, I refuse to wear a button fly.

561
00:36:28,666 --> 00:36:30,130
Rym: I remember those got popular for a little bit.

562
00:36:30,171 --> 00:36:32,397
Rym: I was like, no, that just delays me peeing.

563
00:36:36,222 --> 00:36:36,302
Scott: Yeah.

564
00:36:36,322 --> 00:36:39,732
Scott: Yeah, no, the pullover hoodie is just sort of like, uh, like.

565
00:36:39,913 --> 00:36:42,380
Scott: I don't understand why they still make it when the zipper exists.

566
00:36:42,521 --> 00:36:43,166
Scott: Is it cheaper?

567
00:36:43,186 --> 00:36:45,180
Scott: Is like wind going to come in the zipper area?

568
00:36:46,101 --> 00:36:54,240
Rym: It's warmer, but the problem for me is if I want something that's like warm, warm, where the zipper is going to matter, I'm wearing a jacket at that point.

569
00:36:55,942 --> 00:36:59,260
Rym: And if you're really cold, you get a jacket where you've got the special zippers that are insulated.

570
00:37:00,621 --> 00:37:03,200
Rym: Like all my ski jackets are like that and all my sports jackets are like that.

571
00:37:05,161 --> 00:37:08,009
Rym: But I also focus on hoodies as a fashion thing.

572
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:15,720
Rym: Like I mostly wear them, like I said, in conventions because they're versatile, but also because every hoodie I own is definitely social currency.

573
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:22,600
Rym: They're all either like packs, hoodies, or like from, from some property or like I've got a glitch wave hoodie that I really like.

574
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,760
Rym: Like they're definitely primarily fashion accessory.

575
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:31,000
Scott: I mean, that is an interesting thing in, in 2020, you know, or at least more recently, right.

576
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:39,160
Scott: Is it's like, you know, say when like Rocky wore a hoodie, it's like, that wasn't like a fashion item that was like a workout clothing.

577
00:37:39,862 --> 00:37:46,380
Rym: Like I'd always imagine hoodies as being black or gray, maybe red, like all one color, cotton, cheap.

578
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:51,460
Rym: But now when I think of hoodie, I think of like my like line of fancy hoodies that are hanging over there.

579
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:52,621
Scott: Right.

580
00:37:52,661 --> 00:37:53,745
Scott: It's like the hoodie now.

581
00:37:53,926 --> 00:37:57,820
Scott: is it's like, it's, it's utilitarian and fashionable at the same time.

582
00:37:58,201 --> 00:38:02,220
Scott: You know, it's, it, you know, you can, you can show off like your, your sweet hoodie.

583
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:10,354
Scott: Let me, Champion, the company, I guess it was originally called something else at the time they invented the hoodie, but it became Champion, which I don't know who owns it now.

584
00:38:10,575 --> 00:38:11,580
Scott: Wikipedia will probably tell you.

585
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,388
Scott: But the brand still exists.

586
00:38:13,489 --> 00:38:15,240
Scott: And that was the brand that invented the hoodie.

587
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:20,459
Scott: The hoodies they make now are like super nice, fancy fashion hoodies.

588
00:38:20,539 --> 00:38:20,740
Scott: Right.

589
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:26,780
Scott: They're not like, I mean, I guess you could wear one and go rake the leaves, but you probably wouldn't because it's a lot of money.

590
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:33,140
Rym: I went through this like the cheapest rapid transition, like about 2019 where I had like, I only owned one hoodie.

591
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:37,620
Rym: It was that original PEX one that I got and it wore the fuck out because I wore it a lot.

592
00:38:39,222 --> 00:38:42,540
Rym: And I started to like have to get a new hoodie, wear it out, get a new hoodie, wear it out.

593
00:38:42,941 --> 00:38:47,780
Rym: And I changed to a strategy now of own a bunch of hoodies and rotate through them.

594
00:38:47,861 --> 00:38:49,960
Rym: So no one of them wears out particularly quickly.

595
00:38:50,881 --> 00:38:51,101
Scott: Right.

596
00:38:51,121 --> 00:38:57,919
Scott: So a Champion, the default pullover Champion hoodie, the reverse weave hoodie is like 60 bucks.

597
00:38:58,902 --> 00:38:59,142
Scott: Right.

598
00:38:59,564 --> 00:39:09,380
Scott: But if you scroll down immediately, right past the first row of boring old hoodies, you see just tons of tons of fancy hoodies that are all fashiony.

599
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,576
Scott: We got Mario hoodie, Toad hoodie, Mario hoodie.

600
00:39:14,241 --> 00:39:19,660
Rym: I really like hoodies that have a striking, even if they're playing on the outside, the inside of the hood.

601
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,147
Scott: Here's some with iridescent logos on them.

602
00:39:21,167 --> 00:39:23,940
Scott: Here's one with a giant C for Champion on the front.

603
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,387
Scott: Here's some camo hoodies.

604
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:27,560
Scott: Here's one with a different color hood.

605
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:31,660
Scott: It's like a white hoodie, but the hood itself is like turquoise and it's kind of fluffy, right?

606
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,185
Scott: I like the materials, right?

607
00:39:33,225 --> 00:39:36,820
Scott: So we think of, at least in terms of the Champion hoodie, right?

608
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:41,740
Scott: You're thinking of like, you know, that sort of cotton jersey sweatshirt, sweat pant material.

609
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:45,679
Rym: I only have one hoodie like that and I only use it for like ski lodge stuff.

610
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:46,700
Scott: Right.

611
00:39:46,721 --> 00:39:47,866
Scott: Hoodies today, it's like.

612
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:50,980
Scott: you got fleece lined hoodies and that's like not, that's tame.

613
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:59,809
Scott: You've got like velour kind of hoodies, all kinds of, you know, fancy materials, different textures, some really smooth hoodies, right?

614
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:06,071
Scott: You got hoodies with like, you know, fancy sport tech type, you know, wools and things, right?

615
00:40:06,353 --> 00:40:11,350
Scott: You know, it's all the same shape basically, but different thicknesses, right?

616
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:14,320
Scott: Here's one with a mesh pocket on the front with a zipper.

617
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:17,680
Scott: It's obviously not utilitarian pocket, right?

618
00:40:18,401 --> 00:40:24,304
Rym: You know, actually I realized one benefit of the pullover hoodie is usually the two pockets combined for added warmth.

619
00:40:24,344 --> 00:40:27,120
Scott: Yes, usually you have the kangaroo pocket on the pullover hoodie.

620
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,840
Scott: So if you're into the kangaroo pocket, the zipper isn't going to.

621
00:40:29,981 --> 00:40:30,565
Rym: I'm not a fan of that.

622
00:40:30,586 --> 00:40:32,439
Rym: What I like, I only have one hoodie that has this.

623
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:37,400
Rym: It's that original Pax Prime hoodie, the blue one, the one that peeled up like we all have.

624
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:47,100
Rym: The thing about that one is in the right pocket, there's a little like sub pocket that is exactly the right size to wedge a cell phone into.

625
00:40:48,822 --> 00:40:51,720
Rym: And I actually love that feature and use it a lot.

626
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:57,560
Rym: And I've never found another hoodie that has that little tiny sub pocket that is exactly the right size for a cell phone.

627
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,110
Scott: Well, the pocket on the hoodie is another great thing, right?

628
00:41:00,151 --> 00:41:01,819
Scott: Because, you know, you think about it.

629
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:04,995
Scott: It's like, OK, you get pants pocket, right?

630
00:41:05,478 --> 00:41:05,860
Scott: Whatever.

631
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:06,842
Scott: And you got your.

632
00:41:07,123 --> 00:41:11,860
Scott: normally if a shirt has a pocket, it's like a dorky pocket, you know, protector pocket, right?

633
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:16,740
Scott: The hoodie gives you pockets in a place that a coat gives you pockets.

634
00:41:17,522 --> 00:41:20,220
Scott: But now you can have those pockets indoors like those.

635
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:27,300
Scott: If you had if you're wearing a hoodie, those are now the primary, most accessible, most useful, you know, easily grabable pockets.

636
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:34,180
Rym: Now, I wouldn't put anything like super important, like I'm not putting my keys in those pockets because I feel like they'd fall out if I wasn't careful.

637
00:41:34,421 --> 00:41:35,152
Scott: It depends on the hoodie.

638
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:43,040
Rym: Somebody said like the pockets have like a little bit, a stitch at the bottom and they're angled the right way to where stuff won't fall out, kind of like bike jerseys.

639
00:41:43,301 --> 00:41:48,620
Rym: But I've seen some hoodies where if you like look the wrong way or bend slightly, everything just falls out of the pockets.

640
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:49,441
Scott: Right.

641
00:41:49,481 --> 00:41:53,019
Scott: But also, if you are maybe wearing clothing that does not have any pockets.

642
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:54,561
Scott: Right.

643
00:41:54,922 --> 00:42:04,380
Scott: You know, say maybe you're wearing, you know, some maybe like some like tights for some exercise, like some yoga situation.

644
00:42:04,801 --> 00:42:05,083
Scott: Right.

645
00:42:05,989 --> 00:42:07,800
Scott: It's like those don't have pockets on them usually.

646
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:08,422
Scott: Right.

647
00:42:08,482 --> 00:42:09,125
Scott: Yeah.

648
00:42:09,145 --> 00:42:13,540
Scott: Or, you know, maybe you're wearing like a skirt and it doesn't have pockets or a dress with no pockets.

649
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,140
Scott: You know, you could pop a hoodie on over to the top pockets.

650
00:42:16,721 --> 00:42:16,941
Scott: Right.

651
00:42:18,465 --> 00:42:23,640
Scott: It's a you know, and it's such a. the hoodie is such a, you know, gender neutral garment.

652
00:42:23,801 --> 00:42:24,042
Scott: Right.

653
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:26,799
Scott: It's pretty much anyone can wear one at any age.

654
00:42:27,361 --> 00:42:27,662
Scott: Right.

655
00:42:27,783 --> 00:42:30,700
Scott: At any time in almost any situation.

656
00:42:30,901 --> 00:42:31,061
Scott: Right.

657
00:42:31,101 --> 00:42:32,205
Scott: A hoodie can be appropriate.

658
00:42:32,226 --> 00:42:32,346
Scott: Right.

659
00:42:32,366 --> 00:42:36,080
Scott: You could even see someone like wearing a fancy gown at a ball.

660
00:42:36,521 --> 00:42:36,782
Scott: Right.

661
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:43,479
Scott: But meanwhile, on their chair at their table where the assigned seating is, they got a hoodie over the back of the chair.

662
00:42:44,122 --> 00:42:45,372
Scott: That doesn't seem strange at all.

663
00:42:45,553 --> 00:42:46,380
Rym: That's perfectly normal.

664
00:42:46,622 --> 00:42:48,380
Rym: You know, my day job is in capital markets.

665
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:57,040
Rym: And just because of the nature of my work, sometimes I'm wearing like a blazer and sometimes I'm wearing nice jeans, a T-shirt of some kind and a hoodie.

666
00:42:57,221 --> 00:42:59,699
Rym: And that is just totally accepted and expected.

667
00:43:02,681 --> 00:43:06,820
Rym: So the fanciest hoodie I own in terms of like the quality, it's weird that this is the one.

668
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:15,420
Rym: Like it is just so much higher quality than any other hoodie I've ever owned is of all things that Penny Arcade, remember Automata?

669
00:43:16,441 --> 00:43:16,934
Scott: Oh, that one.

670
00:43:16,954 --> 00:43:17,118
Scott: Yeah.

671
00:43:17,281 --> 00:43:19,898
Rym: And they made that special like black on black on black hoodie.

672
00:43:20,341 --> 00:43:23,020
Rym: That hoodie ended up just being like such high quality.

673
00:43:23,562 --> 00:43:25,258
Rym: Like that is the best hoodie I own by far.

674
00:43:26,441 --> 00:43:34,220
Scott: So, you know, early, I guess early in my life, most of the hoodies I got, I would buy, you know, before buying clothes online and going to fancy stores.

675
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:34,481
Scott: Right.

676
00:43:34,521 --> 00:43:38,600
Scott: There was like, you know, the local clothing store that was in Connecticut.

677
00:43:38,802 --> 00:43:38,964
Scott: Right.

678
00:43:38,984 --> 00:43:39,976
Scott: Where you just buy clothes at.

679
00:43:40,864 --> 00:43:42,660
Scott: I think it was called like Bob's something.

680
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:45,180
Scott: It wasn't related to the discount furniture, whatever.

681
00:43:47,184 --> 00:43:48,459
Scott: I don't think it was like a huge chain.

682
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:50,620
Scott: But, you know, imagine like a Kohl's basically.

683
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:51,906
Scott: Same kind of place.

684
00:43:52,148 --> 00:43:53,820
Scott: Only clothes, mostly clothes.

685
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:54,565
Rym: Yeah, it was Midwest.

686
00:43:54,606 --> 00:43:56,560
Rym: So we were mostly national chains.

687
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:58,123
Scott: Yeah.

688
00:43:58,143 --> 00:43:58,183
Scott: OK.

689
00:43:58,506 --> 00:44:00,360
Scott: But I mean, it was still a chain.

690
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,948
Scott: It just, you know, but you'd go in there and if I wanted a hoodie, I would get the one.

691
00:44:03,988 --> 00:44:09,320
Scott: I would get a Rangers hoodie or a Mets hoodie or, you know, a sports team related hoodie.

692
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:09,802
Scott: Right.

693
00:44:10,125 --> 00:44:11,459
Scott: And who knew who was made by.

694
00:44:11,621 --> 00:44:13,439
Scott: And I didn't care about clothing quality then.

695
00:44:13,781 --> 00:44:14,043
Scott: Right.

696
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:16,200
Scott: You know, and those are the hoodies I had.

697
00:44:16,701 --> 00:44:17,384
Scott: Just whatever.

698
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:20,880
Scott: I think maybe I did have the actual champion hoodie at one point.

699
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:21,463
Scott: I don't remember.

700
00:44:21,483 --> 00:44:24,780
Scott: You know, but hoodies are actually kind of like expensive.

701
00:44:24,942 --> 00:44:25,123
Scott: Right.

702
00:44:25,143 --> 00:44:26,476
Scott: Compared to like, say, a shirt.

703
00:44:26,496 --> 00:44:26,880
Scott: Right.

704
00:44:27,401 --> 00:44:32,380
Scott: It's like, you know, if some artist you like is like making merch, it's like you want to buy their T-shirt.

705
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:34,792
Scott: It's like, oh, OK, 20 bucks, maybe 25, 35 if it's extra fancy.

706
00:44:36,341 --> 00:44:36,563
Scott: Right.

707
00:44:36,804 --> 00:44:37,570
Scott: They're making a hoodie.

708
00:44:37,691 --> 00:44:39,060
Scott: It's like, yeah, it's 67.

709
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:40,200
Scott: It's a lot of money suddenly.

710
00:44:41,862 --> 00:44:45,480
Scott: But then, you know, I started buying hoodies later with stuff I cared about on them.

711
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:45,880
Scott: Right.

712
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:46,662
Scott: Like pecs hoodies.

713
00:44:47,122 --> 00:44:49,726
Scott: But they were making these pecs hoodies on.

714
00:44:49,766 --> 00:44:59,660
Scott: basically the way that works is, you know, some artist is just buying stock hoodies from some company, Gildan or American Apparel or Hanes or who knows who.

715
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:00,322
Scott: Right.

716
00:45:00,342 --> 00:45:05,120
Scott: For someone of those, you know, major clothing companies just buying blank hoodies and screen printing on them.

717
00:45:05,881 --> 00:45:09,379
Scott: And the hoodie that they choose is not always going to be the best hoodie.

718
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:14,040
Rym: The pecs hoodies have definitely gotten worse and worse quality as time has gone on.

719
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:14,983
Rym: Like, I'm glad they're buying.

720
00:45:15,023 --> 00:45:20,580
Scott: They're basically buying in bulk the cheapest blank hoodie they can get and then putting, you know, pexifying.

721
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:24,420
Rym: Like, I'm very glad I own the first like pecs blue hoodie, like the good one.

722
00:45:24,681 --> 00:45:28,099
Rym: And that first pex east hoodie, because those are way higher quality than the hoodies I've seen.

723
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:33,880
Scott: They are higher quality, but the quality overall compared to all hoodies in the world is still not that high.

724
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:34,160
Scott: True.

725
00:45:34,221 --> 00:45:45,340
Scott: So the biggest thing that wears out on the hoodies, the problems I've had with them personally is, A, the hood, the inside of the hood can get kind of there even if you wash it.

726
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:51,320
Scott: Especially if the lining is thin or if the color is bright and your head oils get on there.

727
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,433
Scott: It's like you just can't wash them out no matter what.

728
00:45:53,473 --> 00:45:54,540
Scott: And especially I got a bald head.

729
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,300
Scott: So it's even worse if you're putting I guess room is not putting the hood on.

730
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,728
Rym: So I never put the hood on.

731
00:45:58,749 --> 00:46:00,400
Rym: So my hoods are all like immaculate.

732
00:46:01,204 --> 00:46:04,640
Scott: The dark colored hoodie obviously has less problem with that sort of thing.

733
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:10,360
Scott: And then the other thing is that thin material, right, can wear because you're wearing a hoodie a lot.

734
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:13,037
Scott: Like you might wear the hoodie every day or frequently.

735
00:46:13,057 --> 00:46:13,500
Scott: Right.

736
00:46:13,941 --> 00:46:19,080
Scott: So what ends up happening is it just gets worn out because you're wearing it more.

737
00:46:19,743 --> 00:46:22,020
Scott: And the areas that it gets worn out are elbows.

738
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:27,039
Scott: If you're putting your elbows on tables a lot, especially which I do, I'm doing it right now.

739
00:46:28,741 --> 00:46:34,359
Scott: And also the pockets, if you've got stuff in the pockets sagging them down, rubbing on the inside of them.

740
00:46:35,361 --> 00:46:46,320
Scott: And so I've had hoodies with like a hole in the pocket or a hoodie where the elbow is... Like all my PAX hoodies, you look at the elbow and it looks like someone just rubbed them a whole bunch.

741
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:55,740
Rym: Well that's especially because when you're wearing a PAX hoodie at PAXs, because we go to a lot of PAXs, half the time you're sitting there with your elbows down on a table playing a tabletop game.

742
00:46:56,303 --> 00:46:57,951
Scott: But I do it also just every single day.

743
00:46:57,991 --> 00:46:59,820
Scott: That same hoodie I wear at PAX, I bring to work.

744
00:47:00,201 --> 00:47:01,378
Scott: And then I wear at work all day.

745
00:47:03,181 --> 00:47:04,124
Scott: But yeah, they wear out.

746
00:47:04,204 --> 00:47:10,270
Scott: So recently I went online and I was searching through hoodies to find like... I didn't care what was on the hoodie.

747
00:47:10,371 --> 00:47:11,339
Scott: I was okay with plain color.

748
00:47:11,881 --> 00:47:16,620
Scott: I just wanted to find the strongest, most comfortable, highest quality hoodie that was available.

749
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:19,079
Rym: I think that's the Automata Penny Arcade hoodie.

750
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:21,800
Scott: No, you haven't seen this hoodie that I got.

751
00:47:22,001 --> 00:47:24,860
Scott: So I don't know if this one is the best one.

752
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:31,100
Scott: Because basically what I did is I went and I read a whole ton of hoodie reviews and watched hoodie reviews on YouTube.

753
00:47:31,762 --> 00:47:34,659
Scott: And I learned a lot about all the different available hoodies to choose from.

754
00:47:35,182 --> 00:47:37,940
Scott: And I chose one, and that one that I chose was so great.

755
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,140
Scott: So I have nothing to compare it against.

756
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:44,960
Scott: There may be a greater one that I simply, because I just chose one based on other people's advice, I chose wisely.

757
00:47:47,201 --> 00:47:49,531
Scott: Or it could be that no, actually this isn't the best hoodie.

758
00:47:49,571 --> 00:47:50,395
Scott: There is a better one.

759
00:47:50,435 --> 00:47:51,459
Scott: I just didn't discover it.

760
00:47:51,862 --> 00:47:54,239
Scott: But it's so much better than any hoodie that I've owned.

761
00:47:54,921 --> 00:47:59,120
Scott: And you can tell immediately out of the box, out of the bag, that it's so great.

762
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:02,900
Scott: So it's made by this company I've never heard of before called American Giant.

763
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,951
Scott: The hoodie is almost too thick.

764
00:48:07,071 --> 00:48:09,180
Scott: It's super warm when you put it on.

765
00:48:09,601 --> 00:48:12,978
Scott: It's like, whoa, I had to take it off because I'm too warm.

766
00:48:14,823 --> 00:48:16,854
Scott: They had a medium weight one, but they sold out.

767
00:48:16,874 --> 00:48:17,980
Scott: So I kind of want to get one of those.

768
00:48:18,563 --> 00:48:21,440
Scott: The elbows are actually reinforced, right?

769
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:31,180
Scott: So the material for the sleeve, it's got a full sleeve, but then there's an extra piece of material that comes on top of the sleeve, right?

770
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:40,300
Scott: It's like an extra, extra layer that goes from the front half of the forearm, like the bottom half of the forearm, all the way to covering the elbow.

771
00:48:40,781 --> 00:48:42,459
Scott: So it's like double reinforced there.

772
00:48:43,924 --> 00:48:45,340
Scott: And the zipper is way strong.

773
00:48:45,841 --> 00:48:47,005
Scott: The hood, right?

774
00:48:47,025 --> 00:48:51,520
Scott: So I look on the Pax hood, for example, the Pax hoodie, and it's two layers on the Pax hoodie.

775
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:56,020
Scott: There's the cotton jersey, and then there's like this thin lining on the inside, right?

776
00:48:57,281 --> 00:49:03,700
Scott: This hoodie, the American Giant one, whatever, the hood is two layers of cotton jersey.

777
00:49:03,881 --> 00:49:05,615
Scott: It's just like a double thick hood, right?

778
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:12,140
Scott: It's ridiculously solid and heavy, and the size and shape of the hood varies a lot, actually.

779
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:19,754
Scott: I watched a lot of hoodie reviews, and they were like, "This hood covers my whole head.

780
00:49:19,814 --> 00:49:20,475
Scott: This one doesn't.

781
00:49:20,495 --> 00:49:21,577
Scott: This one's super huge.

782
00:49:21,637 --> 00:49:22,559
Scott: Look, you can't even see my

783
00:49:22,599 --> 00:49:22,860
Scott: face.".

784
00:49:23,262 --> 00:49:25,019
Scott: There was so much variance in the hood shape.

785
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,127
Scott: You know, this hood keeps falling down.

786
00:49:28,207 --> 00:49:31,420
Scott: I can't see with this one, but the hood shape was just excellent.

787
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:38,440
Scott: So yeah, I think if you... The problem is it's just really hard to get sort of the two-in-one deal, right?

788
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:48,600
Scott: There's nobody out there who's taking an expensive, ultra-high quality garment and then also putting their cool webcomic art on it, right?

789
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:52,295
Scott: The webcomic artist that wants to sell hoodies, they're going to sell $50 hoodies, not $150 hoodies.

790
00:49:53,500 --> 00:50:01,440
Rym: Because most people buying a hoodie for the intellectual property that is associated with it are doing it solely for that purpose.

791
00:50:02,168 --> 00:50:02,500
Scott: Exactly.

792
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:03,500
Rym: It is social currency.

793
00:50:04,785 --> 00:50:07,455
Scott: I don't know how much market there is for, you know.

794
00:50:08,459 --> 00:50:08,640
Scott: Anyway.

795
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,000
Scott: But yeah, it's the nicest hoodie I've ever had, probably.

796
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:17,699
Scott: And people I saw who had it and reviewed it said it lasted them many, many years and was still new.

797
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:24,234
Scott: And holding it, even though it's only a week old or whatever, I can see how that could be the case, and I hope it is.

798
00:50:24,254 --> 00:50:26,480
Scott: So we'll find out.

799
00:50:27,464 --> 00:50:30,860
Rym: Yeah, the hoodie I got, and it's sad because I got it literally.

800
00:50:32,361 --> 00:50:39,520
Rym: I ordered it right before PAX East, went to PAX East, I got this hoodie, and I can't fucking go anywhere.

801
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:43,700
Rym: So no one's seen me wear it, really, except the burger joint downstairs.

802
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:46,789
Rym: But I got this super glitch wave hoodie.

803
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:48,294
Rym: It's like a slim fitting hoodie.

804
00:50:48,414 --> 00:50:50,119
Rym: I've seen a lot more slim fits these days.

805
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:52,757
Rym: And it's my favorite hoodie.

806
00:50:53,301 --> 00:50:57,417
Rym: And I was actually weirdly looking forward to wearing it at a PAX, and I can't.

807
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:01,467
Rym: Because I'm kind of done wearing the PAX hoodie to the PAX.

808
00:51:01,507 --> 00:51:06,420
Rym: That's starting to feel more and more like I'm wearing the shirt of the band to the band's concert.

809
00:51:08,601 --> 00:51:13,537
Rym: Like I want to signal some other thing that I'm interested in when I'm at a PAX, because you know I'm a PAX person.

810
00:51:13,577 --> 00:51:14,219
Scott: I'm at the PAX.

811
00:51:18,674 --> 00:51:19,229
Scott: Alright, well.

812
00:51:20,832 --> 00:51:21,808
Rym: I think that killed enough time.

813
00:51:22,671 --> 00:51:23,615
Scott: Okay, but yeah, hoodies.

814
00:51:23,836 --> 00:51:26,630
Scott: Essential garment of, you know, the times.

815
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:32,050
Rym: I feel like hoodies are going to be very iconic of the late 2010s and 2020s, like in terms of fashion.

816
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:35,479
Scott: Yeah, there's so many other, you know, every kind of clothing, right?

817
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,809
Scott: You can go on and on about if you knew more about it than we did.

818
00:51:39,531 --> 00:51:52,230
Scott: But my guess would be if you're going to pick one particular clothing item, right, that really symbolizes, you know, the time that we have lived in, like the hoodie is way up there, right?

819
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:54,115
Scott: It's certainly not like the jean.

820
00:51:54,155 --> 00:51:55,739
Scott: The jean was for a previous era.

821
00:51:56,200 --> 00:52:00,190
Scott: Not that we don't wear them, but I think it's more symbolic of a time before us.

822
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:06,930
Rym: And I think the types of jeans people wear, like the fashion of jeans, has actually moved around a lot over the last couple of decades.

823
00:52:07,312 --> 00:52:10,749
Scott: It's like the baseball hat is strong, but it's not the baseball hat, you know?

824
00:52:11,830 --> 00:52:14,842
Rym: Yeah, I haven't seen a lot of other types of hats.

825
00:52:15,002 --> 00:52:16,990
Rym: People are really wearing berets a lot in the US.

826
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:18,337
Scott: It could be the sneaker.

827
00:52:18,418 --> 00:52:20,049
Scott: The sneaker is really strong, right?

828
00:52:20,723 --> 00:52:20,890
Rym: True.

829
00:52:21,330 --> 00:52:22,789
Scott: The hoodie and the sneaker are pretty close.

830
00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:25,877
Rym: But that's really dependent.

831
00:52:25,937 --> 00:52:30,269
Rym: I think there's more cultural bounds to the fancy sneakers than there is to a fancy hoodie.

832
00:52:31,171 --> 00:52:32,235
Scott: Yeah, it doesn't have to be fancy.

833
00:52:32,255 --> 00:52:34,763
Scott: I'm just saying, like, all hoodie versus all sneaker, right?

834
00:52:36,549 --> 00:52:36,710
Scott: Anyway.

835
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:40,905
Rym: I guess I could make a GeekNights hoodie high quality with the new logos and everything.

836
00:52:41,367 --> 00:52:42,130
Rym: Like, that could be classy.

837
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:46,129
Scott: Yeah, you know, but how high quality are we going to make it?

838
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:52,870
Rym: Yep, I can make it mid quality without doing any work because I do have that Amazon account, but high quality would take some effort.

839
00:52:54,391 --> 00:53:00,867
Scott: Just so people are aware, let's see, the hoodie that I bought is the American Giant Classic Full Zip.

840
00:53:00,947 --> 00:53:03,610
Scott: It costs $112.

841
00:53:03,610 --> 00:53:07,003
Rym: Yeah, so would you buy a $120 GeekNights hoodie?

842
00:53:07,104 --> 00:53:08,710
Rym: Otherwise, you're not going to get a high quality hoodie.

843
00:53:10,291 --> 00:53:19,150
Scott: I mean, if this hoodie does end up lasting for many, many years more than other hoodies have lasted, then that's actually kind of like a bargain, right?

844
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:21,998
Scott: Because if you think of regular hoodies, $60, this is the cost of two hoodies.

845
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:26,030
Scott: If it lasts as long as, you know, two shitty hoodies, you're saving, right?

846
00:53:26,111 --> 00:53:28,049
Rym: Someone in the chat said something about Root hoodies.

847
00:53:30,596 --> 00:53:31,230
Scott: Like the board game?

848
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:32,478
Rym: That's what I was assuming.

849
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:34,190
Rym: Maybe it's just a brand because I don't see any Root.

850
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:37,270
Scott: There is a company that I think called Roots that makes hoodies.

851
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:39,124
Rym: I think it's Roots makes good hoodies, not.

852
00:53:39,165 --> 00:53:39,790
Rym: there are Roots hoodies.

853
00:53:39,870 --> 00:53:42,422
Scott: Yes, there is a clothing company called Roots.

854
00:53:42,442 --> 00:53:43,085
Scott: If you go to roots.com.

855
00:53:44,571 --> 00:53:53,930
Scott: The thing I don't like about the Roots ones actually, I did look at those, is that they prominently put the Roots logo like right on the front of pretty much all of their clothing.

856
00:53:55,510 --> 00:53:58,518
Scott: And I like to have clothing where the logo is not on there, right?

857
00:53:58,538 --> 00:54:03,170
Scott: You go to Uniqlo and it's like very few clothes at Uniqlo have a Uniqlo logo on the clothes.

858
00:54:03,610 --> 00:54:05,516
Scott: You buy a red shirt there, it's a red shirt.

859
00:54:05,937 --> 00:54:08,425
Scott: But if you buy a Roots hoodie, it says Roots on the front.

860
00:54:08,726 --> 00:54:09,830
Scott: Odds are it says Roots on the front.

861
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:10,675
Rym: Yeah, I don't want that.

862
00:54:10,716 --> 00:54:12,910
Rym: That just reeks of Abercrombie and Fitch.

863
00:54:13,552 --> 00:54:19,830
Scott: Well, I think the one I hate the most is Superdry because Superdry clothes, actually the aesthetic of those clothes, I like a lot.

864
00:54:21,013 --> 00:54:22,630
Scott: It's not my favorite, but I do like it a lot.

865
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:24,841
Scott: The only thing I'm not a fan of is the puffy jacket.

866
00:54:24,921 --> 00:54:26,590
Rym: I've never liked puffy jacket.

867
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:31,610
Scott: Yeah, every single item of clothing in the Superdry store says Superdry on it.

868
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:38,010
Scott: And it's like if you had just taken your logo off of that clothing, I would have paid probably more than what you're charging to buy it.

869
00:54:38,331 --> 00:54:40,456
Scott: Because the shape looks pretty good.

870
00:54:40,476 --> 00:54:45,650
Scott: But no, it says Superdry and I'm like get that shit out of here.

871
00:54:51,942 --> 00:54:54,080
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

872
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:59,220
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

873
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:04,620
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

874
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:07,560
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

875
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:12,320
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

876

877
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:20,080
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

878
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:23,280
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

879
00:55:24,381 --> 00:55:32,820
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights are Alan Joyce, Heike McNichol, Marty Grenier, Link E.G, Graham Finch, you hold the key to my heart.

880
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:35,656
Rym: And I yelled at the cabbie, "Yo, home smell, smell ya

881
00:55:35,696 --> 00:55:35,938
Rym: later!".

882
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:47,920
Rym: Clinton Walton, Ren from New Zealand, Ryan Perrin, Chris Minkiff, Dre, Lily Tenebrae, JustLikeADudeGuy, Chris Reimer, Finn, Shervin Von Horl, and a whole bunch of people who do not want me to say their names.

883
00:55:48,441 --> 00:55:53,556
Rym: So I'm not going to inflict more Neil Cicierega on you, but instead, I've got something else that's kind of fun.

884
00:55:53,897 --> 00:55:54,980
Rym: Hopefully you recognize it.

885
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:58,467
Scott: It's all skeletons, isn't it?

886
00:55:58,750 --> 00:55:59,549
Rym: Yeah, let's go.

887
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:01,662
Rym: Right, but why is it all skeletons?

888
00:56:02,306 --> 00:56:02,910
Scott: What did we do?

889
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:06,050
Scott: We did have a lot of xylophones on the last record.

890
00:56:06,350 --> 00:56:08,610
Scott: Right, that we did, six or seven.

891
00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:11,290
Scott: Why'd we put so many goddamn xylophones on the song?

892
00:56:11,551 --> 00:56:15,290
Scott: I had been listening to a lot of Tom Waits, and he's got those marimbas.

893
00:56:15,752 --> 00:56:17,110
Scott: Under Your Thumb, Rolling Stones.

894
00:56:17,214 --> 00:56:17,570
Rym: Exactly.

895
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:18,429
Scott: It's a cool sound.

896
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:22,570
Scott: It's woody, it's haunting, it's underutilized in rock music.

897
00:56:22,890 --> 00:56:26,870
Scott: We really should have splurged on the full-sized marimba and not gotten that dinky xylophone.

898
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:27,432
Scott: We should have.

899
00:56:27,533 --> 00:56:28,338
Rym: We totally should have.

900
00:56:28,378 --> 00:56:29,244
Rym: Now look what's happened to us.

901
00:56:29,406 --> 00:56:30,050
Scott: This is karma.

902
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:32,030
Rym: If we just run, are they going to chase us?

903
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:33,521
Rym: They're skeletons, Mike.

904
00:56:33,803 --> 00:56:34,810
Rym: They're unpredictable.

905
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:05,550
Rym: Stand on the Earth, or else we'll lose.
