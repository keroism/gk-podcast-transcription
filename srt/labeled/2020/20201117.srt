1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,348
Rym: It's Tuesday, November 17th, 2020.

2
00:00:10,348 --> 00:00:10,589
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,507 --> 00:00:13,980
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,564
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight.

5
00:00:15,804 --> 00:00:23,661
Rym: We are reviewing Ricochet, a Half-Life mod from the year 2000.

6
00:00:23,661 --> 00:00:24,677
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,014
Rym: So, as you know, Joe Biden did, in fact, win the presidency.

8
00:00:30,054 --> 00:00:31,620
Rym: Like, we crossed that bridge.

9
00:00:31,881 --> 00:00:39,570
Rym: But we still have to win that Senate race or we can't really do anything in this country until the year 2022 because of how messed up our government structure is.

10
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:53,140
Rym: So, because of weird nonsense, there are two Senate races that are deferred until January that literally determine which of the two American parties control our entire government, effectively.

11
00:00:55,521 --> 00:01:00,780
Rym: So, unrelated to that, as many of you know, I don't open loot boxes in Overwatch, like, ever.

12
00:01:01,221 --> 00:01:04,019
Rym: Mostly because it annoys many of you that I don't open them.

13
00:01:04,462 --> 00:01:08,079
Rym: Like, every time I stream Overwatch, at least a couple people bother me about it.

14
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:14,675
Rym: Like, that number bothers them, that seeing that, like, unopened number just sitting there, 1,102, like, it just bothers them to them.

15
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:24,340
Scott: The loot box number doesn't bother me, but I am bothered, actually, when I look at other people's phones and I see all these red dots of, like, notifications that are unread and shit.

16
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,374
Scott: Oh, that bothers me, too.

17
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:33,320
Scott: It's like, if you're not gonna read your notifications or clear them or read all your email, just disable the notifications.

18
00:01:34,102 --> 00:01:36,719
Rym: It's like, you know, if you don't want to read it, turn it off.

19
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,777
Rym: Way, way, way more than that is when I see a screenshot of someone's phone with, like, 1% battery left.

20
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,869
Scott: Yeah, it's like, why are you not, like, what are you doing?

21
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:48,399
Scott: that your phone isn't plugged in, like, that long?

22
00:01:49,347 --> 00:01:49,980
Scott: I don't understand.

23
00:01:50,840 --> 00:02:08,080
Rym: But, basically, I did a thing where I donated a dollar for every unopened loot box I had to Stacey Abrams' Fair Fight and then I played Overwatch with a bunch of our friends, listeners and friends, until we raised an equivalent donation of the number of loot boxes to Fair Fight and the deal was... So, reverse matching?

24
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,383
Rym: Yup, reverse matching.

25
00:02:09,523 --> 00:02:17,980
Rym: If the listener matched however many loot boxes I had and how much I had donated, then I would just stop playing Overwatch and open all the loot boxes on stream.

26
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,440
Scott: We went way over the goal.

27
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,540
Scott: So, basically, you would play Overwatch until people paid enough money.

28
00:02:22,801 --> 00:02:24,220
Rym: That was the goal, but people donated real quick.

29
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,980
Scott: But if you had to play Overwatch, if people weren't donating and you had to play Overwatch, you might still be playing now.

30
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,920
Rym: Yeah, well, the thing is, it was play Overwatch until people donated enough money to match my loot boxes.

31
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,553
Rym: Right, if people didn't donate, you would still be playing Overwatch.

32
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,879
Rym: I would have donated twice as much myself, so I could stop playing.

33
00:02:43,807 --> 00:02:44,120
Scott: Oh, okay.

34
00:02:44,461 --> 00:02:45,759
Rym: I probably would have done that at some point.

35
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,780
Rym: But the listener actually went way beyond the target.

36
00:02:50,402 --> 00:02:55,720
Rym: So, I ended up also matching any donations anyone made above my original match.

37
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,319
Scott: So, then you had a reverse-reverse match.

38
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:57,741
Rym: Yup.

39
00:02:58,082 --> 00:03:02,075
Rym: So, with all that combined, we raised a grand total of $4,006 for the Georgia Senate race.

40
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,140
Rym: Which, that's actually, that's real money.

41
00:03:06,882 --> 00:03:09,460
Rym: That's enough money that could make a serious difference.

42
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,712
Rym: And I want to point out...

43
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,276
Scott: You could have bought a computer for somebody instead.

44
00:03:13,336 --> 00:03:13,840
Scott: Two computers.

45
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,440
Rym: Yeah, but instead, this is not donating to their campaigns in Georgia.

46
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,380
Rym: There's plenty of people funding, like, rich people can fund the people actually running.

47
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,740
Rym: This is going to an org that focuses almost entirely on voting access and anti-voter suppression.

48
00:03:27,242 --> 00:03:29,899
Rym: Which is way more important than any particular race.

49
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:34,300
Scott: That should also have effects on other races in the future.

50
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,400
Rym: But it just so happens that fighting voter suppression in America automatically helps Democrats in all cases.

51
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:44,980
Rym: For some magical reason that you can figure out if you read, like, a paragraph of any history book.

52
00:03:46,703 --> 00:03:47,933
Rym: So, yeah, that rhyme is done.

53
00:03:48,115 --> 00:03:48,659
Rym: Thank you all.

54
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,840
Rym: A few people donated a lot of money, and I really thank you for that.

55
00:03:53,261 --> 00:03:55,400
Scott: People who have a lot of money donate more money.

56
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,694
Rym: A lot of people donated, like, 5 bucks, 10 bucks.

57
00:03:57,734 --> 00:03:58,680
Rym: That's also totally cool.

58
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,184
Rym: Like, give what you can.

59
00:04:00,224 --> 00:04:04,660
Rym: If you're poor, don't donate thousands of dollars to political campaigns.

60
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,700
Scott: No, if you don't have any, don't give any.

61
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:15,140
Scott: Like I say, even if there's a good reason, giving money to this is better than giving money to Rym's Patreon or whatever.

62
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,680
Scott: But if you got no money, even this, you should not be.

63
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,798
Scott: Yeah, no matter how good it is to give them money, it's like, you got nothing, bro.

64
00:04:25,878 --> 00:04:26,079
Scott: Don't.

65
00:04:28,744 --> 00:04:29,231
Scott: It's for you.

66
00:04:29,292 --> 00:04:29,759
Scott: You need it.

67
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:37,699
Rym: But the thing I want to mention, really, about this is that it turns out it takes a long fucking time to open that many loot boxes.

68
00:04:37,999 --> 00:04:38,240
Scott: Good.

69
00:04:38,801 --> 00:04:40,899
Rym: God, did the stream take, like, five hours.

70
00:04:41,804 --> 00:04:41,936
Scott: Yep.

71
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:48,140
Rym: At one point, I just balanced a Blades in the Dark book on the space bar and walked away, opening all my basic-ass loot boxes.

72
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,620
Scott: Yeah, I mean, we're going to actually talk about Hearthstone today and the news for the first time in a very long time.

73
00:04:53,900 --> 00:05:03,839
Scott: But I remember back in the day, it's like the streamers would buy Hearthstone packs when new sets came out, and they'd buy hundreds of packs to sort of guarantee getting all the cards because they needed them all.

74
00:05:04,281 --> 00:05:19,598
Scott: And even though they were, like, very tight with Blizzard, right, you know, to varying degrees, they still had to hold the space bar and open all the packs, and it took them forever, and some people would watch those streams because it would be like, you know, "Oh, you got a golden card!

75
00:05:19,658 --> 00:05:20,240
Scott: Wow!".

76
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:25,992
Scott: You know, that kind of moment, but I guess, did you have any of those moments?

77
00:05:26,012 --> 00:05:29,659
Scott: Like, wow, the ultra, ultra rare Amazing Skin came out of the loot box.

78
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:29,819
Scott: Wow.

79
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:39,260
Rym: The only moments I had, because the thing I do in Overwatch, there's, you know, you get voice lines and bind them to keys so your character can, like, basically play a wave file at everyone.

80
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,927
Scott: Circle around back, basically?

81
00:05:41,087 --> 00:05:42,332
Rym: Yeah, and there's a lot of them.

82
00:05:42,814 --> 00:05:46,340
Scott: So, what I did for-- Until now, you've only had the standard ones.

83
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:54,100
Rym: Oh, no, because I, so that 1100 loot boxes, I actually opened all the loot boxes I got for, like, the first six months that Overwatch was out, a little bit longer.

84
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:54,582
Rym: Oh, okay.

85
00:05:54,642 --> 00:05:58,080
Rym: I only stopped opening them one day when someone got annoyed that I had a bunch of unopened ones.

86
00:05:58,544 --> 00:05:59,190
Rym: And I was like, "You know what?

87
00:05:59,211 --> 00:05:59,978
Rym: I'm never opening them

88
00:05:59,998 --> 00:06:00,160
Rym: again.".

89
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,440
Scott: Oh, okay, so you opened them at the same time.

90
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,609
Rym: I opened them for a while in the beginning, so I accrued over a thousand.

91
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:09,240
Rym: since that one listener was annoyed at me and I vowed to never open them again.

92
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:14,140
Scott: Yeah, that's easier than, you know, like, a Hearthstone pack is actually game affecting.

93
00:06:14,821 --> 00:06:16,440
Rym: Yeah, these are 100% cosmetic.

94
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,970
Scott: These are 100% cosmetic.

95
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,060
Scott: It's like, you don't need any of those.

96
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:30,600
Rym: But, I got a few particularly annoying voice lines, because my only goal with those voice lines is to bind, for each character, the most annoying possible voice line to use at critical moments.

97
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:36,699
Rym: So, like, the Torbjorn, the little dwarfy guy, he has one where he's just like, "Hard work pays

98
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:36,960
Rym: off!"

99
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,355
Rym: And you can spam it to where he's just sitting there going, "Hard work!

100
00:06:39,395 --> 00:06:39,697
Rym: Hard work!

101
00:06:39,717 --> 00:06:39,858
Scott: Hard

102
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:40,120
Scott: work!".

103
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,438
Scott: Yeah, Rym's favorite thing, "Make annoying noises to bother other

104
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:43,760
Scott: people.".

105
00:06:44,081 --> 00:06:45,828
Rym: Oh my god, there's one annoying one.

106
00:06:45,888 --> 00:06:48,960
Rym: It's so long that I could actually spam it forever.

107
00:06:50,446 --> 00:06:50,780
Scott: Okay.

108
00:06:51,502 --> 00:06:52,799
Rym: I look forward to using that in play.

109
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,220
Rym: So, speaking of Hearthstone, what's this news that everyone's mad about?

110
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:04,780
Scott: So, up until now, the way Hearthstone worked is that if you wanted cards or whatever, you had to fucking buy them, right?

111
00:07:05,782 --> 00:07:10,379
Scott: And, when you played Hearthstone, you could get a certain amount of gold.

112
00:07:11,381 --> 00:07:14,920
Scott: There was a certain amount of progression you could get by just playing Hearthstone, right?

113
00:07:14,981 --> 00:07:16,219
Scott: A certain amount of gold you could earn.

114
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:22,160
Scott: I think if you got like three wins a day every day, and there's just a certain amount, and that was it.

115
00:07:22,621 --> 00:07:24,540
Scott: You knew it wasn't very high.

116
00:07:24,981 --> 00:07:31,100
Scott: You could play a ton of Hearthstone, and basically the amount of gold you could get was sort of capped, without spending real money.

117
00:07:32,861 --> 00:07:39,040
Scott: But, you sort of knew what that amount was, and you knew how much you had to play to sort of get that amount that was coming to you.

118
00:07:40,521 --> 00:07:42,520
Scott: So, they decided to change things up.

119
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:48,220
Scott: I don't know all the details of the new system, because it's been a few years since I played Hearthstone, and I'm very unlikely to play it again.

120
00:07:48,861 --> 00:07:49,846
Scott: The coffin was already nailed shut.

121
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,060
Rym: The game is fun, but I cannot deal with collectible anything anymore.

122
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:07,220
Scott: The coffin on Hearthstone for me was sealed shut a few years ago, but this news is basically somebody coming into a dusty crypt, finding a nailed shut coffin.

123
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:13,391
Scott: That has not been opened, that no one has wanted to open, but it says on it, "Vampire inside do not open,".

124
00:08:13,411 --> 00:08:16,857
Scott: and the guy goes, "Whoa, someone in the future might accidentally open this.

125
00:08:17,738 --> 00:08:18,520
Scott: Let me weld it

126
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:18,780
Scott: shut.".

127
00:08:18,901 --> 00:08:20,034
Scott: And that's what this news is.

128
00:08:22,881 --> 00:08:35,000
Scott: So, what they're doing now is some sort of experience-based system, forgetting you reach certain goals during the season, week, whatever.

129
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:41,596
Scott: And also, when sets come out, they're releasing mini-sets and more cards over time.

130
00:08:43,581 --> 00:08:50,820
Scott: I guess that's actually sort of a good idea, because it keeps things a little fresher instead of having a big card drop all at once and then sort of nothing for a long period.

131
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,392
Scott: It's like, "Here's a drop," and then a few weeks later, "Okay, here's some more.

132
00:08:55,412 --> 00:08:58,300
Scott: Here's 20, 30 more cards," and then, "Okay, here's more," right?

133
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,043
Rym: There's pros and cons.

134
00:09:00,063 --> 00:09:04,200
Rym: When I was a middle schooler with Magic, if there was a new Magic set every week, I would have been totally down for that.

135
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:09,620
Scott: That's sort of closer to one of the good parts about the living card games like the Netrunner, right?

136
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,579
Scott: More frequent changes to the game spice things up, right?

137
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:32,425
Scott: But the overall story here is that people, of course, dug deep and did the math on this, and it's like, "Yeah, if you are not spending money on Hearthstone with the current news system that is hard to understand, that I'm not going to invest much time in trying to understand it, it seems that it is most likely,".

138
00:09:32,465 --> 00:09:47,090
Scott: they're not even 100% sure because it's such a mess, "it is most likely that you are, despite them saying that they would not decrease how much you could earn for free, it seems like, yeah, if you're not paying money, you're getting less cards and stuff for free.

139
00:09:48,293 --> 00:09:50,779
Scott: And if you do pay money, it's probably going to cost you more to

140
00:09:50,819 --> 00:09:51,040
Scott: play.".

141
00:09:51,321 --> 00:09:54,892
Rym: This article goes into pretty good depth about exactly what's going on.

142
00:09:54,933 --> 00:09:57,240
Rym: It has some preliminary numbers.

143
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:12,740
Rym: I guess what bothers me about this whole situation just generally is that half of what's going on with how this entire gold system works is just because of capitalism and they have to monetize this game somehow.

144
00:10:13,861 --> 00:10:16,080
Rym: While also making it as addictive as possible.

145
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:24,313
Scott: And also, I think, as the popularity, it sort of mirrors what happens in a lot of nerdy-nish things.

146
00:10:24,634 --> 00:10:48,847
Scott: We talk about this a lot in the comic book world, where it's like, "A nerdy thing has an audience large enough with enough money to keep it alive, but the audience is shrinking, so they need, instead of finding a way to expand the audience," from the people who are still playing Hearthstone, right?

147
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:52,557
Scott: The audience is smaller, let's squeeze more juice from the same fruit, right?

148
00:10:54,940 --> 00:11:10,680
Scott: It just keeps bringing me back to that old idea of like, hey, just make an online card game, just like Magic Arena or Hearthstone, and just charge the flat subscription like, wow, and give everyone everything, and make frequent small updates to keep it fresh all the time.

149
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:16,680
Rym: The problem with that is that you can't make enough money with that model to actually keep a game going.

150
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:24,013
Scott: You could make enough money to keep the game going, you would just have a small dev team and just keep it going nice and easy.

151
00:11:24,053 --> 00:11:27,700
Scott: Don't try to, you know, don't expect to be mega mega rich Blizzard style, right?

152
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:33,150
Scott: You wouldn't make enough money for it to be worth it for a Blizzard Activision level of company to keep it alive.

153
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,653
Scott: They'd be like, "What are the revenues on that?

154
00:11:34,954 --> 00:11:37,078
Scott: Why are we keeping this thing around?

155
00:11:37,118 --> 00:11:37,839
Scott: This isn't making any

156
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:38,080
Scott: money.".

157
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:45,880
Scott: But that amount of money, while being minuscule for them, would still be enough for like, a house full of devs and artists to make a living.

158
00:11:47,244 --> 00:11:48,839
Rym: That all costs a lot.

159
00:11:50,900 --> 00:12:02,900
Rym: And also, I think a lot of these types of monetization scams, I almost said scams because I kind of feel that way, they really prey on addictive behavior and variable reward schedules.

160
00:12:03,361 --> 00:12:12,080
Rym: And I think the amount of money they extract from player bases, and I'm not saying that Hearthstone is specifically bad in this regard, this is an industry-wide problem.

161
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:15,290
Scott: I mean, it's bad, but it's actually one of the less evil, right?

162
00:12:15,311 --> 00:12:16,173
Scott: And that's saying a lot.

163
00:12:16,274 --> 00:12:18,140
Scott: That's how evil the other ones are.

164
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:26,560
Rym: But like, I am not really comfortable or cool with the variable reward schedules that are built into games to make them more engaging in this regard.

165
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,966
Scott: Especially when those variable reward schedules are related to money, right?

166
00:12:33,026 --> 00:12:37,773
Scott: If you play an autochess-ish game, you're still enjoying that same luck.

167
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:42,380
Scott: variable reward schedule situation, because it's a random game, mostly.

168
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:47,628
Scott: But you are not paying money to spin the wheel.

169
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:49,811
Scott: You're just spinning the wheel like a free slot machine.

170
00:12:50,873 --> 00:12:52,575
Scott: Don't put money in and money doesn't come out.

171
00:12:52,595 --> 00:12:55,600
Scott: It's just points, you get points, and all you do, you don't put anything in, right?

172
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:05,453
Scott: Whereas a real slot machine into real casino, you put money in, and sure, money probably isn't going to come out over time, but it could.

173
00:13:05,473 --> 00:13:07,697
Scott: It's a non-zero chance, and it's not rigged.

174
00:13:07,857 --> 00:13:09,740
Scott: You could win the progressive jackpot.

175
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,440
Scott: And as a non-zero chance, it's like a one in a zillion chance, but it's a non-zero chance.

176
00:13:14,921 --> 00:13:22,654
Rym: But there's also, there's this weird side problem of, I get the impression a lot of people who play games like this, and again, I'm not calling Hearthstone out here.

177
00:13:22,694 --> 00:13:24,276
Rym: We just happen to be talking about Hearthstone.

178
00:13:24,677 --> 00:13:26,280
Rym: It's better than other games in this regard, too.

179
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:35,659
Rym: I feel like there are a lot of people who, when they play these games, they're almost playing more for their completionist set-collecting model than for the game itself.

180
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,844
Rym: Because those are the people who care about this, "Well, I need X gold to get everything,".

181
00:13:39,864 --> 00:13:52,920
Rym: and I wonder if my metric for if a game is ethical is, I don't know where the line is, but there's a line somewhere, what percentage of players without that variable reward meta system would not play the game at all?

182
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,046
Rym: Even if there's no money involved.

183
00:13:55,347 --> 00:13:58,520
Scott: Who would not play without that automatic progression stuff?

184
00:13:59,402 --> 00:14:07,500
Scott: Like I was saying, the Hearthstone and the other loot boxes of the world, you're putting money in like it's a real slot machine and nothing comes out.

185
00:14:09,301 --> 00:14:13,626
Scott: And it's not even like an arcade game where you put a quarter and a Pac-Man.

186
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:14,867
Scott: It's even worse than that.

187
00:14:25,561 --> 00:14:30,100
Rym: But I'm not really trying to get anything out of it other than the enjoyment of the activity.

188
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:43,900
Scott: But to your point, there are indeed people who play something like Hearthstone and it's like they probably log in and, you know, in the previous system at least where I think you had to get like three wins or something to get the gold each day or something.

189
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,860
Rym: They log in every day, they get the three wins, they stop playing.

190
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,101
Scott: Exactly.

191
00:14:47,341 --> 00:14:59,860
Scott: I think there were people who would do that versus the people who were playing it as an esport who would play it constantly in order to get better at it and improve and get their skills up and try to win the competitions and such.

192
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:05,379
Scott: But I think even those people would make sure to get three wins every day.

193
00:15:06,061 --> 00:15:20,279
Rym: The problem is I think without this gold system, if there were not, like if Overwatch, Overwatch, if Hearthstone didn't have to be monetized to this degree and it was just the online digital card game, it would be crazy fun.

194
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:23,618
Rym: And I'd probably still be playing it.

195
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:24,860
Scott: Maybe.

196
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:31,780
Rym: But I actually, I can't like keep, I just don't, I cannot engage with these loot box systems at all anymore.

197
00:15:34,121 --> 00:15:39,980
Scott: I'm actually, you know, the Magic Arena has like drafting online, I think, which would be fun, I think, except it's not free, I don't think.

198
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:40,453
Rym: Yeah.

199
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,361
Scott: I'm not sure.

200
00:15:41,922 --> 00:15:54,080
Scott: I said I don't think like 10 times, but I would love to play a game online where it was sort of like you actually do a real draft with other human beings and then play against them in like a tournament, right?

201
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,300
Scott: Sort of get that feeling I had.

202
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,500
Rym: That's a little bit like why Autochess captured us for a little while.

203
00:15:59,502 --> 00:15:59,765
Scott: Yeah.

204
00:16:00,069 --> 00:16:00,919
Scott: Anyway.

205
00:16:01,621 --> 00:16:01,862
Rym: All right.

206
00:16:01,902 --> 00:16:11,520
Rym: So in some other news of gamers mad about something, Twitch has also ticked off a whole bunch of, now this is not the DMCA thing, but it's actually more related to it than you might think.

207
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:12,420
Scott: Yeah.

208
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,102
Scott: So here's the deal.

209
00:16:13,142 --> 00:16:16,191
Scott: There's a music company, right?

210
00:16:16,231 --> 00:16:19,018
Scott: It's like a record label, I think, called Music Something Cat.

211
00:16:19,119 --> 00:16:19,580
Scott: What is it called?

212
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,004
Rym: Oh God.

213
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:21,400
Rym: It's buried somewhere in this article.

214
00:16:22,322 --> 00:16:22,785
Scott: Yeah.

215
00:16:22,905 --> 00:16:23,750
Scott: I don't know the name of them.

216
00:16:23,992 --> 00:16:25,360
Scott: I haven't heard of them before today.

217
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,162
Scott: Monster Cat.

218
00:16:26,182 --> 00:16:28,140
Scott: So some record label or something called Monster Cat.

219
00:16:28,741 --> 00:16:33,592
Scott: And Monster Cat made a deal with Twitch and the deal is, hey, you are a Twitch streamer.

220
00:16:34,234 --> 00:16:37,080
Scott: You buy a Monster Cat subscription, right?

221
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:45,000
Scott: So you subscribe to Monster Cat's record label, service, whatever it is, and they're going to let you stream their music on Twitch and be safe, right?

222
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,166
Scott: And not have to worry about any copyright bullshit.

223
00:16:47,226 --> 00:16:52,380
Scott: And it's like, oh, that's actually, you know, rather than have Twitch make the deal, right?

224
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:57,780
Scott: This is, first of all, Twitch should be the one paying the music license, not the streamer.

225
00:16:58,402 --> 00:17:02,360
Scott: So they're basically shoveling off that cost, right, to the streamer.

226
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:07,632
Rym: The streamer paying would be a situation where there is a celebrity streamer with their own business around it.

227
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,680
Rym: Like, that's a very different world from the vast majority of Twitch streamers.

228
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:10,921
Scott: Right.

229
00:17:10,941 --> 00:17:14,839
Scott: But anyway, so you can pay Monster Cat and then you can stream their music in your stream.

230
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,740
Rym: It's only five bucks a month.

231
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:25,619
Scott: In addition to this, you will then also immediately achieve Twitch affiliate status.

232
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:30,060
Scott: So if people aren't aware, if you're a streamer on Twitch, you start out with no status.

233
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:37,200
Scott: So if you go to my Twitch channel, which has no status, basically I don't have any custom emotes.

234
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,744
Scott: You can't sub to me.

235
00:17:38,885 --> 00:17:39,608
Scott: Like, you just can't.

236
00:17:39,969 --> 00:17:41,675
Scott: You cannot subscribe to my Twitch channel.

237
00:17:41,696 --> 00:17:42,820
Scott: You can't give me bits.

238
00:17:43,901 --> 00:17:44,684
Scott: You can't do anything.

239
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:46,349
Scott: I cannot make money on Twitch.

240
00:17:46,369 --> 00:17:48,998
Scott: I don't know if you see ads if you watch my channel.

241
00:17:49,018 --> 00:17:49,600
Scott: You probably do.

242
00:17:50,481 --> 00:17:53,896
Rym: It's a very different world from how YouTube monetization works.

243
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:54,900
Rym: They're, like, completely different.

244
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:01,120
Scott: If my stream gets popular enough, Twitch will then allow me to become a Twitch affiliate.

245
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,535
Scott: I think I'm pretty close to that.

246
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:04,160
Scott: Not that I would.

247
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,400
Rym: The bar's real low to get affiliate.

248
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,416
Scott: The only thing I don't have is average.

249
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,302
Rym: This fucking stream.

250
00:18:09,483 --> 00:18:12,355
Rym: This YouTube stream is way above the requirements.

251
00:18:12,415 --> 00:18:13,620
Rym: Like, just three nights live.

252
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:13,980
Scott: Right.

253
00:18:14,001 --> 00:18:18,300
Scott: We're talking about my personal Twitch doesn't have five average viewers, right?

254
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,739
Scott: So, um, but yeah, even if I did reach that, I probably wouldn't take it because, like, I don't want it.

255
00:18:24,902 --> 00:18:28,740
Scott: But that is what lets you, once you have that, it's like, okay, well now you can have subs.

256
00:18:28,901 --> 00:18:29,825
Scott: Now you can take bits.

257
00:18:29,906 --> 00:18:31,533
Scott: Now you get some custom emotes.

258
00:18:31,594 --> 00:18:32,840
Scott: Now you get some stuff, right?

259
00:18:33,582 --> 00:18:39,878
Scott: If you get really big, we're talking a whole bunch of other metrics, but the biggest metric, the hardest one to achieve is 75 average viewers.

260
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,245
Scott: That's average.

261
00:18:42,286 --> 00:18:43,295
Scott: So, like, if you're, you know...

262
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,600
Rym: Average across, like, 12 different days and 50, like, 20 or 30 hours of streaming a month.

263
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:54,860
Scott: Right, so they take 12 whole days, right, worth of your stream, and they say where's the average viewership over this total thing, 75.

264
00:18:54,860 --> 00:19:07,656
Scott: So that means when you start your stream and there's no one there and you wait for, like, people to see and come in, all those minutes of, like, 10 streamers, 20 streamers need to be counterbalanced by later minutes in your stream, which have 80, 100 viewers, right?

265
00:19:10,761 --> 00:19:18,500
Scott: But anyway, so you need to have that, and then you apply, and if they approve you, you can become a Twitch partner.

266
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,560
Scott: And if you're a Twitch partner, then you can really make money on Twitch.

267
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:28,860
Scott: Like, you're not making big, big money relatively speaking to the world, but people live by being Twitch partners, right?

268
00:19:29,141 --> 00:19:34,220
Scott: They can, like, quit their jobs and live in a low expense place.

269
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:41,140
Rym: Like, for a lot of people, being a Twitch partner is a big deal, but becoming an affiliate, not really a big deal.

270
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:50,580
Scott: No, but there are a lot of, if you look on Twitch, the vast majority of people with their Twitch streams, right, are struggling to reach even affiliate, right?

271
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:54,939
Scott: If you click on a game, think of a game that you like, I don't know, Smash Brothers, whatever, right?

272
00:19:55,221 --> 00:20:09,495
Scott: Go to Twitch, click on Smash Brothers, and you'll see all the Smash Brothers streams, and at the top, you'll see a bunch of people who are Twitch partners, and then you'll see some people who are affiliates, like a few, and then you'll see a long, long list of people with 1, 0, 2, maybe, viewers, right?

273
00:20:12,121 --> 00:20:16,180
Scott: A lot of people, and none of those people are even affiliate, they're all nothing, right?

274
00:20:16,461 --> 00:20:30,840
Scott: And those people want to be affiliate, and here, you have a situation where you can pay money to a company that has a business relationship with Twitch, to instantly get affiliate status, even if you have no viewers, even if you signed up for Twitch yesterday.

275
00:20:32,562 --> 00:20:35,360
Scott: And that's sorta shady, right?

276
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:42,280
Rym: Well, it's tricky, because on one hand, below that threshold, how much money could you actually even make?

277
00:20:43,381 --> 00:20:46,446
Scott: Well, that's it.

278
00:20:46,506 --> 00:20:54,380
Scott: The reason Twitch has this system is because, for them, how much money does Twitch make off of you if you're not bringing in the viewers, right?

279
00:20:54,500 --> 00:21:02,460
Scott: They want to, A, both encourage people to, you know, try really hard to get more viewers, right?

280
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:09,900
Scott: So that they'll make more money, and they'll be able to make money, and then Twitch will make money off them because their stream is big enough and worth showing ads on.

281
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:23,620
Scott: But if somebody's stream is just so sad that no one ever watches it, you're actually costing Twitch money because you're not bringing in, you know, even if they let people sub to you, no one would sub to you.

282
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,104
Scott: You're just using their bandwidth for free.

283
00:21:25,124 --> 00:21:31,220
Scott: So if you can't cut it, they actually want you to leave and stop streaming, which is why they have this bar.

284
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:37,820
Rym: There's actually a YouTube monetization problem a while back where people complained that YouTube wouldn't let them monetize their videos if they were too small.

285
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:45,300
Rym: But, like, yeah, if you have four viewers a month, no one wants to put an ad on a channel that has four people watching it.

286
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,260
Scott: Right, they actually want you to stop streaming, so they're purposefully discouraging you.

287
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,719
Rym: Or, at the very least, they don't want to pay you to stream.

288
00:21:53,561 --> 00:22:02,060
Scott: Right, so this whole system exists to both encourage streamers to try to, you know, do what Twitch wants them to do, to control their behaviors.

289
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:13,040
Scott: And also here, again, it's like, okay, we'll let you make money off your Twitch stream and whatever, you're paying five bucks, so now we know we're getting money from you even if no one watches you, right?

290
00:22:14,141 --> 00:22:17,393
Scott: Twitch is probably getting money from the record company.

291
00:22:17,473 --> 00:22:19,139
Scott: in reverse, there's some kind of deal there.

292
00:22:19,521 --> 00:22:25,240
Rym: It's interesting to me that people are so mad about this particular issue, because what you're paying for is Monstercat Gold.

293
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,923
Rym: That's what you're actually paying for.

294
00:22:27,364 --> 00:22:33,340
Rym: The fact that Twitch lets you be an affiliate if you pay that money seems to be completely immaterial to anything except ego.

295
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:40,855
Rym: Because a lot of people are very small-time streamers who get that email, like, "Hey, you're a Twitch affiliate,".

296
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:42,620
Rym: like, they really frame it as leveling up.

297
00:22:43,381 --> 00:22:47,380
Rym: And people really get excited about that and invested in that.

298
00:22:48,260 --> 00:23:01,780
Scott: Yeah, I mean, it's like, look, you've been spending your whole life with no viewers watching big-time streamers subbing to them, and suddenly, alright, you have finally, after much difficulty and much time invested in streaming, guess what?

299
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,985
Scott: Now you can have people sub to you.

300
00:23:04,546 --> 00:23:10,540
Scott: If you're living in the Twitch world, that's a huge deal to some kid who has no money and no job or whatever.

301
00:23:10,921 --> 00:23:20,120
Rym: But at the same time, if you ignore that ego perception thing, the actual money that you could make is negligible at that level.

302
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,560
Scott: Maybe not negligible to some kid with no money and no job.

303
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:31,877
Rym: Yeah, but even below affiliate status, if you got any subs that could actually raise real money, you'd already be an affiliate.

304
00:23:31,897 --> 00:23:33,420
Rym: You'd already get above that level naturally.

305
00:23:35,921 --> 00:23:48,277
Rym: So it is interesting to me, like, the anger seems to be coming from the mass of streamers who are basically just running into all these problems because they're trying to make this a job, but honestly, this is not a viable job for 99.99% of all people who try to do it.

306
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,440
Scott: Yep, anyway.

307
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,590
Rym: And independently, Twitch is making a lot of moves like this recently.

308
00:23:55,272 --> 00:23:57,660
Rym: We talked about the DMCA apocalypse that's happening over there.

309
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:10,840
Rym: I still suspect that Twitch as a business unit is in not great financial straits, but I do not have any evidence of that other than the behavior of Twitch in public over the last few months.

310
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:12,181
Scott: I don't know.

311
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:19,634
Scott: I think that they're actually considering the business model of the 21st century of lose money, get a monopoly.

312
00:24:19,754 --> 00:24:23,200
Scott: Once you've got a monopoly, you set the terms, right?

313
00:24:24,021 --> 00:24:33,857
Scott: Twitch, I think, is definitely, in terms of streaming things online live for average people to just broadcast video to an audience and engage with them, is pretty much king.

314
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:35,319
Scott: No one else is really up there.

315
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:39,204
Scott: So they're closest to hitting that.

316
00:24:39,224 --> 00:24:45,714
Scott: I guess YouTube streaming will never go anywhere, but it's not a thing, right?

317
00:24:46,175 --> 00:24:49,400
Scott: So as long as it doesn't become a thing, and Facebook stream definitely isn't a thing.

318
00:24:51,045 --> 00:24:51,727
Rym: Makes it die.

319
00:24:51,767 --> 00:24:55,960
Rym: There's no more competition, so there's two players in this space, and that's that.

320
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:05,419
Scott: Right, so they're entering the phase slowly of continuing to leverage their monopoly position, at least in the parts of the world where Twitch is king.

321
00:25:07,662 --> 00:25:14,400
Rym: Part of the reason why Twitch is getting so much flack for this is that YouTube, under Google, already went through a lot of these growing pains.

322
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,765
Rym: Like, YouTube does not monetize tiny channels.

323
00:25:17,046 --> 00:25:22,520
Rym: YouTube has a lot of demonetization stuff that they did, and people freaked out about it, and now no one's talking about it anymore.

324
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,762
Scott: YouTube also pays music licensing.

325
00:25:26,023 --> 00:25:42,920
Scott: If you put music in your YouTube thing, even with permission or whatever, YouTube pays the correct music licenses, and the money is sent to the songwriters and artists and whatever, appropriately, according to law, to the best of YouTube's ability.

326
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:48,220
Rym: Well, YouTube also has a DMCA counter-takedown system that Twitch refuses to implement.

327
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:52,053
Scott: Right, but the point is, Twitch doesn't do anything.

328
00:25:52,073 --> 00:25:53,980
Scott: Twitch doesn't pay the money they're supposed to be paying.

329
00:25:56,481 --> 00:25:58,164
Scott: And I think other services as well.

330
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:09,540
Scott: I think that, from what I'm aware of, possibly, the other things, I think if you make a TikTok with a song in it, that I think they actually are also paying appropriately.

331
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,984
Scott: You know, different services are paying and aren't, right?

332
00:26:13,426 --> 00:26:17,473
Scott: And to different places they're paying as well, using different methods and different deals.

333
00:26:18,134 --> 00:26:22,120
Scott: It's a messy world back there, but Twitch is not doing well in that world.

334
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,021
Rym: Exactly.

335
00:26:23,462 --> 00:26:34,060
Rym: I think it's partly that they, for whatever reason, like, YouTube built all this stuff around DMCA things, which actually gave them a lot of, like, a huge head start on avoiding the kinds of problems that Twitch is having now.

336
00:26:34,661 --> 00:26:39,289
Rym: What was interesting to me is how the music industry went so hard so suddenly at Twitch.

337
00:26:41,092 --> 00:26:45,460
Rym: I'd love to hear what conversations happened before that, if any.

338
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:49,606
Scott: Well, I think it really follows, you know, Amazon, right?

339
00:26:49,666 --> 00:26:50,807
Scott: Amazon owns Twitch, right?

340
00:26:50,927 --> 00:26:54,512
Scott: And it's really following the Amazon philosophy of that.

341
00:26:55,413 --> 00:27:00,160
Scott: everything Amazon does is to the benefit of its customer, right?

342
00:27:00,721 --> 00:27:05,707
Scott: And to the benefit of itself, and they always fuck over everyone else, right?

343
00:27:05,747 --> 00:27:15,660
Scott: So Twitch really does things to favor Twitch viewers, and to favor, you know, Amazon and Twitch itself, and probably fuck over, right?

344
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:22,410
Scott: Streamers and, you know, partners, pretty much everyone else in the middle man area, right?

345
00:27:23,592 --> 00:27:24,834
Scott: Twitch is not going to be friendly to.

346
00:27:25,375 --> 00:27:28,299
Scott: Musicians getting their music played on Twitch, it's like Amazon's like,

347
00:27:28,339 --> 00:27:28,439
Scott: "No."

348
00:27:29,061 --> 00:27:29,241
Scott: Right?

349
00:27:29,282 --> 00:27:33,720
Scott: The same way that Amazon.com itself, you know, hurts, you know, the sellers.

350
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:39,090
Rym: Well, remember all the fights between Sony's entertainment divisions and Sony's hardware divisions over the years?

351
00:27:40,433 --> 00:27:44,140
Rym: Like, they basically, like, one of them could destroy the other one.

352
00:27:46,621 --> 00:27:48,625
Rym: So, this is a space we'll just keep watching.

353
00:27:48,665 --> 00:27:55,220
Rym: I feel like there's going to be a big story in this particular space every Tuesday episode for the foreseeable future, the way things are going.

354
00:27:56,281 --> 00:27:56,779
Scott: We'll see.

355
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,502
Rym: Alright, one other news.

356
00:27:58,582 --> 00:28:00,105
Rym: Kind of a big one, actually.

357
00:28:00,486 --> 00:28:08,220
Rym: So, Star Wars, X-Wing, Legion, Armada, all that stuff is moving to, what, Marvel Crisis Protocol Studio?

358
00:28:09,242 --> 00:28:09,645
Scott: Well, no.

359
00:28:09,766 --> 00:28:11,880
Scott: So, it's not actually called Marvel Crisis Protocol.

360
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:14,920
Rym: Well, really, it's Atomic Mass Games, which is really Asmodee.

361
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:16,281
Scott: Yes.

362
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:23,876
Scott: So, Asmodee, as a French board game company that's sort of becoming, like, the big, it is.

363
00:28:24,056 --> 00:28:25,238
Scott: It's like the king of...

364
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:31,620
Rym: They're the second largest board game publisher in the world behind Hasbro.

365
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:32,760
Scott: Yep.

366
00:28:33,141 --> 00:28:40,740
Scott: All of the, you know, there used to be lots and lots of small to medium sized players in the nerd board game space.

367
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,818
Rym: Remember, Mayfair Games?

368
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:43,582
Scott: Right.

369
00:28:43,702 --> 00:28:49,760
Scott: And a lot of those companies, we've done news on this, were basically absorbed, you know, bought out by Asmodee.

370
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:55,939
Rym: Z-Man, Plaid Hat, Philosophia, a whole bunch of German companies I've never heard of.

371
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:56,821
Scott: Yep.

372
00:28:56,882 --> 00:28:59,298
Scott: Pretty much every, like, games workshop, no, right?

373
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,440
Rym: Days of Wonder, Fantasy Flight.

374
00:29:02,502 --> 00:29:02,562
Scott: Yep.

375
00:29:02,582 --> 00:29:02,863
Scott: Right.

376
00:29:02,943 --> 00:29:09,218
Scott: So, Fantasy Flight, we talked about that news when they got bought out, because Fantasy Flight... It was technically a merger.

377
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,844
Scott: Technically, kind of, right?

378
00:29:12,405 --> 00:29:21,080
Scott: And what's been happening since then is, I think we last talked about it with Fantasy Flight's RPGs getting shut down, because not too many people actually bought and played those, really, right?

379
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:26,740
Scott: I think, like, I never heard of anyone actually playing them, and then when I brought it up, I think maybe one or two people were like, "Yeah, but...".

380
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:31,477
Rym: A few listeners came out of the woodwork and were like, "Oh yeah, they had some neat stuff going on, but they used special proprietary

381
00:29:31,517 --> 00:29:31,798
Rym: dice.".

382
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,362
Scott: Yep, that's true.

383
00:29:33,502 --> 00:29:45,360
Scott: Anyway, so, the news now is that, to my knowledge, the most profitable, highest revenue portion of Fantasy Flight's business was the miniatures business, right?

384
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:51,500
Scott: They had these X-Wing miniature, you know, they played X-Wing miniature games, you can even see that game on sale, like, everywhere.

385
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:55,580
Scott: Like, regular old Target, regular old Barnes and Noble, like, everywhere.

386
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:56,802
Scott: R.I.M.

387
00:29:56,862 --> 00:29:58,500
Scott: even got some by accident for Amazon.

388
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,409
Rym: Yep, I still got them!

389
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:02,540
Rym: I saw them recently when I was cleaning out a closet.

390
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,141
Scott: Right.

391
00:30:03,161 --> 00:30:11,200
Scott: That is a, not only was that a very popular game, much more popular than people might realize, but it was also, it's a very high margin business.

392
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:24,120
Scott: You basically, you know, making these cheapo plastic minis that are already painted, and putting a few cards in a box, and charging an arm and a leg for them, and people out there who play this game are buying everything, right, that you put out.

393
00:30:24,641 --> 00:30:26,547
Scott: And the margins are huge.

394
00:30:26,828 --> 00:30:48,333
Scott: They made a lot of money on those miniatures, and now, Asmodee is basically like, "Yeah, you know what, we're gonna take all those Fantasy Flight people that are working on this game, goodbye, you're either fired, or you're gonna move over to this other company that we own, and this other company that we own is now gonna do all the development of those games, and the Fantasy Flight division isn't gonna do them

395
00:30:48,393 --> 00:30:48,715
Scott: anymore.".

396
00:30:50,761 --> 00:30:59,657
Scott: Sort of, you know, it's like, "Hey, you got your company that you work at got bought by a company that does a similar thing to you, and they took your work and gave it to someone else and let you go,

397
00:30:59,677 --> 00:30:59,858
Scott: right?".

398
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:07,080
Scott: And so Fantasy Flight itself, I think, is, you know, clearly, slowly being dissolved, right?

399
00:31:07,801 --> 00:31:09,198
Scott: I just like, what do they still do?

400
00:31:12,001 --> 00:31:19,420
Scott: What games do they have left that Asmodee hasn't chopped up and given to some other, you know, or shut down, or given to someone else yet, right?

401
00:31:20,321 --> 00:31:22,989
Scott: They're really tightening the strings on them.

402
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:25,939
Scott: I think they're already super tight, they're like as tight as can be.

403
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:32,699
Scott: And I'll be surprised if Fantasy Flight, I guess, continues to exist at all some years from now?

404
00:31:33,401 --> 00:31:38,299
Rym: Yeah, because the brand Fantasy Flight, like the people who were like, "Oh, I'm a Fantasy Flight Games

405
00:31:38,339 --> 00:31:38,500
Rym: fan."

406
00:31:39,181 --> 00:31:41,380
Rym: Oh, they have the key, the key forage, whatever.

407
00:31:42,622 --> 00:31:46,592
Rym: But that is an audience that is sort of niche and relatively siloed.

408
00:31:46,612 --> 00:31:49,559
Rym: They're not niche, but they're like expanded market, relatively siloed.

409
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:54,379
Rym: I think it's pretty easy to pick that silo up and park it under a different brand name without losing people.

410
00:31:55,381 --> 00:31:55,541
Scott: Yep.

411
00:31:57,106 --> 00:31:58,170
Scott: But yeah, there's so much.

412
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:01,260
Scott: Fantasy Flight is just like a big mess of stuff to discuss.

413
00:32:02,101 --> 00:32:03,043
Scott: Yeah.

414
00:32:03,284 --> 00:32:08,560
Rym: Every time we talk about Fantasy Flight, I feel like the correct response is to sigh a little bit and then start talking about them.

415
00:32:08,921 --> 00:32:13,419
Rym: There's like so much good and so much just confusing nonsense that happens with them.

416
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:20,140
Scott: Right, but yeah, the strings were tightening from their owner, their new owner, and now they're extra tight.

417
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,927
Scott: And this is sort of like, "Oh, they got

418
00:32:21,948 --> 00:32:22,189
Scott: broke.".

419
00:32:22,229 --> 00:32:24,438
Scott: This is sort of like, "Wow, they're done

420
00:32:24,499 --> 00:32:24,659
Scott: now.".

421
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:25,704
Scott: This is over the hill.

422
00:32:26,326 --> 00:32:29,459
Scott: The rollercoaster has just now crested and is going down.

423
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:36,880
Rym: But think, we're now in a position where two companies publish the vast majority of all tabletop games on Earth.

424
00:32:37,862 --> 00:32:40,480
Scott: Well, mass market tabletop games, right?

425
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,403
Rym: Mass market?

426
00:32:41,503 --> 00:32:44,859
Rym: And I would argue the extended market is also covered by that.

427
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:53,340
Rym: Because in ASMO Day, that's a lot of extended market like euro games that have audiences in parts of Europe or among nerds that are packed.

428
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,348
Rym: But no one's going to buy that other Toys R Us.

429
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:57,820
Rym: Hasbro is edging into that space.

430
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,219
Scott: And people like us retreat into even more nerdier games, right?

431
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,859
Rym: Considering the 18XX game we're playing right now.

432
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,562
Scott: Exactly, right?

433
00:33:05,643 --> 00:33:07,810
Scott: It's like, "Oh, well, I guess the whole world...".

434
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:11,260
Scott: We started out playing Catan just like everyone else in the year 2000.

435
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,679
Scott: And now Catan is in Toys R Us.

436
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:17,180
Scott: Yeah, so now I look at a Catan like the way I used to look at Monopoly.

437
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,840
Rym: Oh, what do we always say from that Jackbox reveal a long time ago?

438
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,173
Rym: "As I age, my predilections become increasingly

439
00:33:22,253 --> 00:33:22,817
Rym: esoteric.".

440
00:33:23,561 --> 00:33:26,416
Scott: Right, and it's like, "Well, now I'm playing some train

441
00:33:26,496 --> 00:33:27,099
Scott: nonsense.".

442
00:33:27,541 --> 00:33:28,905
Scott: It's like, "What are we going to play next?

443
00:33:30,309 --> 00:33:33,358
Scott: Scratching out something on a piece of cartilage in the

444
00:33:33,398 --> 00:33:33,499
Scott: back?".

445
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:37,132
Rym: What we've got is historical refereed wargames.

446
00:33:37,193 --> 00:33:37,855
Rym: That's the end.

447
00:33:37,956 --> 00:33:39,100
Rym: That's when you hit the bottom.

448
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,108
Scott: I don't know if that's the end.

449
00:33:40,128 --> 00:33:41,600
Scott: I think there might be some new ends developed.

450
00:33:42,221 --> 00:33:44,449
Rym: You know what's below refereed wargames?

451
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:47,700
Rym: Full immersion LARP wargames.

452
00:33:48,386 --> 00:33:48,879
Scott: I don't know.

453
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,225
Rym: That's historical reenactment.

454
00:33:50,426 --> 00:33:53,880
Rym: You're going to grow a beard and put on a union uniform and carry a musket.

455
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,079
Rym: And that's what's going to happen.

456
00:33:57,101 --> 00:33:59,920
Scott: Anyway, but yeah, that's a thing.

457
00:34:00,321 --> 00:34:05,140
Rym: Yup, so really briefly, I think this is important news, but I'm not going to talk a lot about it because you should just go watch this.

458
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:08,829
Rym: But this year, this is relatively new.

459
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:12,760
Rym: The 2020 Video Game Accessibility Awards happened.

460
00:34:13,721 --> 00:34:15,089
Rym: This is a very important thing.

461
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,275
Rym: AbleGamers is involved.

462
00:34:16,577 --> 00:34:17,080
Rym: Alana Pierce.

463
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,690
Rym: And oh god, I forget the guy's name, but he's super cool.

464
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:21,478
Rym: I started following him on Twitter a while ago.

465
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,719
Rym: But basically, they did the live stream of the awards.

466
00:34:26,321 --> 00:34:36,840
Rym: And this awards show was one of the best award shows I've ever watched because they actually spent time talking about not just like, "Oh, here are the winners," but why they won.

467
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,360
Scott: I know, right?

468
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:44,899
Rym: Imagine if the Oscars were like, "This movie won because of X, Y, and Z. This is best actor because of this

469
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:45,239
Rym: scene.".

470
00:34:45,663 --> 00:34:46,167
Scott: Yes, exactly.

471
00:34:46,206 --> 00:34:47,135
Scott: They can't do that.

472
00:34:47,176 --> 00:34:47,639
Scott: You know why?

473
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,120
Rym: Because they don't fucking betray them.

474
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,972
Scott: Their system for selection is bullshit.

475
00:34:52,012 --> 00:34:53,219
Scott: They can't explain why.

476
00:34:55,181 --> 00:35:02,580
Scott: But here, the system for selection, the Eisner Awards could do that if they wanted to, but they like to, you know, not anyway.

477
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:03,884
Rym: Steve Spoon, that's his name.

478
00:35:04,527 --> 00:35:07,600
Rym: But Alana and Steven, or Steve, did the stream.

479
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,243
Rym: It's like an hour and a half long.

480
00:35:09,804 --> 00:35:11,107
Rym: This is really worth watching.

481
00:35:11,508 --> 00:35:16,680
Rym: This is a space that does not get enough attention in games and game design.

482
00:35:17,603 --> 00:35:23,240
Rym: Best practices are still only now starting to evolve and start to be accepted among the industry.

483
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:32,936
Scott: I do also think that if you're talking about game accessibility versus just like an Oscar award, which is more of a subjective thing.

484
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,964
Scott: It's like, you know, best actor or whatever.

485
00:35:37,325 --> 00:35:41,876
Scott: Whereas if you're measuring how accessible a game is, obviously it's not 100% objective.

486
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,246
Rym: But there's a rubric to follow.

487
00:35:45,266 --> 00:35:45,567
Rym: You know what?

488
00:35:45,607 --> 00:35:49,140
Rym: It's more like rubric scored Olympic events.

489
00:35:50,282 --> 00:35:53,760
Scott: I think it's even more objective than that a little bit, right?

490
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,004
Rym: Well, here's an example.

491
00:35:55,808 --> 00:35:58,640
Rym: The categories they had this year were things like house rules.

492
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:08,980
Rym: Games that support house rules that themselves allow accessibility to be crafted by players because they make a good point about how no game can be called accessible.

493
00:36:09,301 --> 00:36:19,080
Rym: You can't say a game's accessible because there's such a long tail of very specific accessibility needs that might come down to one individual person with a specific problem.

494
00:36:20,441 --> 00:36:27,540
Rym: So Among Us won that because the customizability of Among Us adds a huge amount of accessibility to that game.

495
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:34,560
Scott: If you've got someone with way bad reflexes and they have to use a really crummy input device because that's the best they can use.

496
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:41,134
Scott: I always remember this one dude at RIT who was in the CS labs and the only part of his body could move reliably.

497
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:51,120
Scott: I don't know exactly what the person's illness was, but basically they would poke the keyboard with basically a long pencil attached to their head.

498
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:55,500
Scott: And they were getting along just fine, but they weren't using their arms or legs.

499
00:36:57,003 --> 00:36:59,950
Scott: And it's like if that person wanted to play Among Us, you could.

500
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:04,580
Scott: You would just make everyone have to move real slow and then everyone would basically be in the same situation.

501
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:09,315
Scott: You wouldn't, you know, because obviously there can't be too dexterous with that.

502
00:37:10,138 --> 00:37:10,760
Scott: This is limits.

503
00:37:17,821 --> 00:37:20,486
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

504
00:37:20,566 --> 00:37:27,320
Rym: So Scott's made a big deal about pointedly doing things of the day that are not in the theme of the geek knight's knights.

505
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:35,638
Scott: Also, it's a fun thing to basically say, "Well, I couldn't find a thing of the day that's related to today, so I'll just try to make it seem like this is a

506
00:37:35,678 --> 00:37:36,139
Scott: positive.".

507
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:43,997
Rym: Yeah, I do it because I have a long backlog of things of the day that if we went by geek knights' knights are really only Thursdays.

508
00:37:44,117 --> 00:37:45,260
Rym: There's nowhere else to put those.

509
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:54,120
Rym: But I went down this road because this is a video I'd seen before, but I saw it again because someone uploaded it to YouTube.

510
00:37:54,862 --> 00:38:02,540
Rym: And it's both incredibly banal and mundane and incredibly terrifying when you really think about what this is.

511
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:09,380
Rym: This is a training video and it's basically a... Imagine someone live streaming what it's like to launch a nuclear missile.

512
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:19,240
Rym: The actual for real procedure from start to finish, from someone calls you while you're sitting on your chair fucking around playing a game on your Switch because there's nothing to do in that job.

513
00:38:20,361 --> 00:38:21,826
Rym: You're about to nuke people.

514
00:38:22,629 --> 00:38:25,540
Rym: And it takes about 4 minutes and 32 seconds to launch a nuke.

515
00:38:26,582 --> 00:38:32,160
Scott: Does it show the part where the people are winking at each other and not actually doing it and then saying they did it and it's not working?

516
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,825
Rym: I realize they're not allowed to face each other.

517
00:38:34,025 --> 00:38:39,020
Rym: And in fact, for Minutemen, which are the more recent... Older missiles work differently.

518
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:45,440
Rym: But the Minuteman, which is the one that's kind of how things go today with a few minor differences, but not many as far as I know.

519
00:38:46,101 --> 00:38:54,000
Rym: They can't see each other and they're actually strapped into chairs facing away from each other partly by design to avoid that possible problem.

520
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:54,921
Scott: Okay, good.

521
00:38:54,941 --> 00:38:59,096
Scott: Then he can't see me when I'm... I don't know if the other guy's doing it or not, but I can say, "Oh yeah, I did it.

522
00:38:59,116 --> 00:38:59,698
Scott: It's not working.

523
00:38:59,738 --> 00:38:59,858
Scott: Oh

524
00:38:59,898 --> 00:39:00,039
Scott: no.".

525
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:00,661
Rym: Yeah.

526
00:39:01,643 --> 00:39:25,020
Rym: Anyway, I'm not going to get into whether or not Scott's strategies work or not, but I encourage you to watch this video because One, it's a very good example of analog or non-computer workflows, like process design and workflow design, and how to make a very complex workflow able to be enacted under extreme circumstances.

527
00:39:25,582 --> 00:39:30,496
Rym: Like, you know when you watch a construction site and someone blows the air horn and people are yelling back and forth at each other?

528
00:39:30,857 --> 00:39:31,860
Rym: There's a reason for that.

529
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:50,600
Rym: And this is just a very... Like, the military of the United States, if you ignore the terrifying problems of the military industrial complex, something that the US military has been extremely good about for a very long time is user experience design and process design in the real world, not just on a screen.

530
00:39:51,081 --> 00:39:59,720
Rym: And this is a very good example of that, but it's also terrifying how this extremely mundane and easy to follow set of steps leads to the deaths of millions.

531
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:02,440
Rym: So what do you got?

532
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:06,148
Scott: Alright, so a much better thing of the day than that does not involve horror.

533
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:11,880
Scott: So there is an anime that was actually... It started out as a little flash anime.

534
00:40:13,823 --> 00:40:18,093
Scott: I don't know, because it's one of those things that only Japanese people know about, right?

535
00:40:18,134 --> 00:40:20,700
Scott: It hasn't really spread around the world as much.

536
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:30,776
Scott: I imagine it's more of a Homestar Runner kind of category, or a Mad Magazine kind of area thing.

537
00:40:30,816 --> 00:40:32,860
Scott: That's the gist I get from what I've read about it.

538
00:40:33,301 --> 00:40:35,887
Scott: Because I've heard about it before, but not too often.

539
00:40:36,227 --> 00:40:37,670
Scott: It's this thing called Eagle Talon.

540
00:40:38,091 --> 00:40:54,600
Scott: And Eagle Talon is basically about... It's sort of like a reverse superhero thing, where it's like this group of villains is the main characters, and the hero good person is like a bully and a jerk, and it's definitely mostly a humorous kind of thing.

541
00:40:57,902 --> 00:40:59,507
Scott: People in Japan, they all know it, right?

542
00:40:59,587 --> 00:41:03,319
Scott: Even though anime fans at an anime con in, say, the US probably would never have heard of it.

543
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:13,613
Scott: And so Eagle Talon got hired once by a Shimane prefecture to do some PR work, right?

544
00:41:13,633 --> 00:41:18,600
Scott: Because in Japan you're always doing mascots for trains and police stations and that sort of thing, right?

545
00:41:19,281 --> 00:41:22,589
Scott: So what they did is they printed t-shirts, right?

546
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:26,820
Scott: Because this is a group of humorous people making short little animes, right?

547
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:34,018
Scott: And they made a t-shirt that said, "The Shimane prefecture is to the left of the Tottori

548
00:41:34,078 --> 00:41:34,600
Scott: prefecture.".

549
00:41:36,221 --> 00:41:39,107
Scott: So the people at the prefecture were like, "What the

550
00:41:39,147 --> 00:41:39,548
Scott: hell?".

551
00:41:39,889 --> 00:41:44,859
Scott: But it turns out that that was really popular, and it even got in the news because it was so funny and clever, right?

552
00:41:47,621 --> 00:42:16,339
Scott: So what actually happened is Eagle Talon, with their skills of humor, got so good at marketing, what they started a tradition, I think it says it started in 2011, so it's a nine-year-old tradition already, is that every year the Eagle Talon staff would produce a Shimane prefecture calendar, and it's basically a funny... The Eagle Talon Shimane self-deprecating calendar, and it's basically a funny calendar that you could buy, and it would make money for the prefecture, I guess, I don't know.

553
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:20,973
Scott: And it was just sort of a funny tradition that's been going on for almost a decade, right?

554
00:42:21,013 --> 00:42:23,120
Scott: Kind of nice, kind of humorous, very good.

555
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,944
Scott: They recently did a different thing.

556
00:42:26,565 --> 00:42:27,968
Scott: This year, they said, "All

557
00:42:28,008 --> 00:42:28,209
Scott: right.".

558
00:42:28,229 --> 00:42:33,480
Scott: It started as a joke and then it became real, as things do, right?

559
00:42:34,321 --> 00:42:46,450
Scott: And they said, "If anyone buys a thousand calendars, we will make a three-minute anime of

560
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:46,670
Scott: you.".

561
00:42:47,561 --> 00:42:57,500
Scott: So the people who make Eagle Talon will make a you anime, so if Rym bought a thousand calendars, then Eagle Talon crew would make a Rym anime that was three minutes long.

562
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:04,099
Scott: And this married couple bought a thousand calendars, and they had these huge cardboard boxes stacking up in there.

563
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,726
Rym: That is big.

564
00:43:06,886 --> 00:43:09,279
Rym: "bought the Home Depot's skeleton" energy right there.

565
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:15,313
Scott: It cost 1.2 million yen, which is still a lot of money.

566
00:43:15,934 --> 00:43:16,756
Scott: How many is that?

567
00:43:16,837 --> 00:43:17,418
Scott: Let's see, 1.2 million yen.

568
00:43:18,261 --> 00:43:19,357
Rym: I feel like that would be worth it.

569
00:43:21,262 --> 00:43:21,949
Scott: It's about $12,000, right?

570
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:24,298
Rym: I feel like that might be worth it.

571
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:25,004
Scott: Divide by a thousand.

572
00:43:25,024 --> 00:43:26,293
Rym: A little less than

573
00:43:26,293 --> 00:43:28,406
Rym: $12,000. $12,000

574
00:43:28,406 --> 00:43:29,757
Rym: for three minutes of anime?

575
00:43:29,817 --> 00:43:30,039
Scott: All right.

576
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:34,507
Scott: Yeah, the husband says he loves Eagle Talon.

577
00:43:34,607 --> 00:43:40,720
Scott: My wife saw the news that 11,000 calendars, and she thought it was a pretty fair deal if it gets you your own anime made.

578
00:43:43,221 --> 00:43:46,132
Scott: The wife said with a grin, "I'm looking forward to this becoming a joke.

579
00:43:46,213 --> 00:43:47,558
Scott: I can brag about saying that I

580
00:43:47,598 --> 00:43:47,759
Scott: did.".

581
00:43:50,182 --> 00:43:54,020
Scott: So I kind of want to see this three-minute anime this way.

582
00:43:54,141 --> 00:43:55,389
Rym: Oh, 100%.

583
00:43:55,389 --> 00:43:56,920
Rym: We've got to review this on GeekNights.

584
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:04,500
Scott: All right, so this is really awesome, and I hope that more awesome things of this nature occur, and I found out about them.

585
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,953
Rym: All right, in the meta moment, we have a new code of conduct.

586
00:44:08,013 --> 00:44:08,636
Rym: You can read it.

587
00:44:08,757 --> 00:44:09,460
Rym: It's pretty chill.

588
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:14,220
Rym: We've only banned one person since we made it go live, so everyone's pretty cool in the GeekNights community.

589
00:44:15,624 --> 00:44:21,500
Rym: Maybe I read one more page of The Tale of Genji, but I have not gotten yet to a page I have not already read.

590
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,880
Scott: Well, I didn't get a message from you saying that you were reading.

591
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:26,600
Rym: Because I did not get past where I stopped.

592
00:44:27,805 --> 00:44:28,280
Scott: Ah, I see.

593
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,999
Rym: I'm still rereading to remember what was going on.

594
00:44:31,962 --> 00:44:32,812
Scott: I see, but you read a page?

595
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:37,820
Rym: I read a page, but it didn't take as long to poop as I expected, so I only read that one.

596
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:38,864
Rym: Well, one real page.

597
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:41,720
Rym: It was like three pages on my phone, but it was like one real page.

598
00:44:42,323 --> 00:44:45,000
Scott: All right, maybe I'll read so I can send you the message.

599
00:44:45,201 --> 00:44:45,321
Scott: Uh-oh.

600
00:44:45,964 --> 00:44:47,532
Rym: It's gonna be a really slow race.

601
00:44:47,552 --> 00:44:48,497
Rym: It's a game of chicken here.

602
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:54,110
Rym: Otherwise, like, we're still stuck at home.

603
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:55,956
Rym: I don't know what we could say.

604
00:44:55,976 --> 00:44:57,040
Rym: We don't have any cons coming up.

605
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:01,840
Rym: There was just breaking news about MAGFest Online, and now there's gonna be a VR component of it.

606
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:03,480
Rym: We'll talk about that on the next Tuesday show.

607
00:45:05,002 --> 00:45:18,251
Scott: The only other thing is I can tell you that for the rest of this year, I only have 1, 2, 3, 8... 3, 8, 13-ish... Not too many days left of work, right?

608
00:45:18,251 --> 00:45:26,220
Scott: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8... Maybe, like, less than 15 days left of work this year, and then I do not have to work anymore.

609
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:28,820
Scott: And also, next week, I do not have to work at all.

610
00:45:29,341 --> 00:45:36,140
Scott: So, obviously, I'm not gonna enter into the shit-talk territory and say all these great things I'm going to accomplish.

611
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:42,660
Rym: Oh, yeah, I'm not talking about anything except the Utena thing, because I have been making slow progress on pre-production for the next Utena episode.

612
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,458
Scott: However, I can safely say this.

613
00:45:46,100 --> 00:46:03,280
Scott: The odds of me accomplishing something and uploading some sort of work to the internet for you to enjoy... ...are greatly increased between basically now, effectively, or at least this weekend, Saturday, right?

614
00:46:03,721 --> 00:46:10,896
Scott: And January 4th, 2021, being the last day... The first day I have to go back to work, I guess?

615
00:46:11,218 --> 00:46:11,379
Scott: Yeah.

616
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:19,133
Scott: So, in that time span, you can keep an eye on the Scott channels, and you might see... There's a chance you could see a lot.

617
00:46:19,173 --> 00:46:19,860
Scott: Who knows, right?

618
00:46:21,708 --> 00:46:24,760
Scott: I wouldn't bet on that, but I would bet on seeing more than zero.

619
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:27,308
Scott: If you said, "Scott, are you going to do more than

620
00:46:27,369 --> 00:46:27,750
Scott: zero?"

621
00:46:27,891 --> 00:46:29,396
Scott: I will say, "Yes, I'll put money on

622
00:46:29,436 --> 00:46:29,577
Scott: that.".

623
00:46:31,002 --> 00:46:32,067
Scott: Are you going to do a lot?

624
00:46:32,087 --> 00:46:33,854
Scott: Not putting money on it, but it's possible.

625
00:46:34,034 --> 00:46:35,500
Scott: Maybe I could get in a run, right?

626
00:46:35,622 --> 00:46:35,733
Scott: Yeah.

627
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:36,839
Scott: Those eight hours a day.

628
00:46:37,562 --> 00:46:46,380
Scott: I can tell you, though, that I realized... I haven't talked about it too much on GeekNights itself, but I'm biking to nowhere lately, right?

629
00:46:46,521 --> 00:46:47,220
Scott: Yep, like you do.

630
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:48,640
Scott: I can't go outside, right?

631
00:46:49,421 --> 00:46:53,980
Scott: And I've been streaming my biking to nowhere on Twitch to not enough people to reach affiliate status.

632
00:46:55,122 --> 00:46:58,597
Scott: I think if I reached affiliate status, I still would say, "No, I don't want

633
00:46:58,637 --> 00:46:58,678
Scott: it.".

634
00:46:59,842 --> 00:47:04,756
Scott: But I realized that I'm not walking.

635
00:47:04,776 --> 00:47:06,020
Scott: I sort of had this realization.

636
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:12,100
Scott: I'm basically spending all of my time sitting or laying because I'm not going outside or even leaving the apartment.

637
00:47:12,882 --> 00:47:22,559
Scott: So I realized, huh, maybe I should bike on the easiest mode every single day, no matter what, even if I'm not going to bike on the hard mode just to move my legs every day.

638
00:47:24,382 --> 00:47:29,000
Scott: And if I'm not working for eight hours a day, there's at least an hour in there, right?

639
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:35,240
Scott: So expect to see at least more of me biking to nowhere on Twitch.

640
00:47:35,881 --> 00:47:41,800
Scott: It's really just come and talk to me so I can do something besides move my legs and stare at the window.

641
00:47:44,225 --> 00:47:45,415
Scott: So you can come talk to me.

642
00:47:45,475 --> 00:47:45,879
Scott: Whoa.

643
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,460
Scott: Just don't break the code of conduct or I'll just ban you with my phone.

644
00:47:51,345 --> 00:47:52,299
Rym: All right, let's get right into it.

645
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:56,900
Rym: So in an Asian past, a game came out called Half-Life.

646
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:04,340
Rym: You could get it on a CD and there was a key on that CD that you had to type in when you installed the game.

647
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:05,629
Rym: The CD was just the game.

648
00:48:05,931 --> 00:48:06,999
Rym: The key made the game work.

649
00:48:07,763 --> 00:48:17,380
Rym: If you had a copy of the game and you had a valid CD key, one thing you could do is play Half-Life Deathmatch online and Half-Life had a way to make mods.

650
00:48:18,721 --> 00:48:28,613
Rym: Valve, the company that made this game called Half-Life, had a modding system and they actually made their own mod for Half-Life that they released on November 1st, 2000, more than 20 years ago.

651
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:35,980
Scott: There were actually quite a few official mods they made or acquired, right?

652
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,193
Scott: People don't realize Counter-Strike was made by someone else.

653
00:48:38,233 --> 00:48:39,420
Scott: Valve bought Counter-Strike.

654
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,272
Rym: Yup, I was playing Counter-Strike before.

655
00:48:41,312 --> 00:48:42,320
Rym: it was an official mod.

656
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:46,340
Scott: I don't know who made Day of Defeat, if that was internal or not.

657
00:48:48,221 --> 00:48:53,080
Rym: So on November 1st, 2000, one of these official mods was released called Ricochet.

658
00:48:54,463 --> 00:48:55,578
Rym: We were obsessed with it.

659
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,980
Scott: So the thing with Ricochet is we didn't even realize it existed.

660
00:49:02,144 --> 00:49:14,220
Scott: Before Steam, when you wanted to play Valve games online, there was a thing called WAN, the World Opponent Network, that you used instead of Steam, and that handled the server listings of how to find a Counter-Strike server.

661
00:49:15,961 --> 00:49:20,670
Scott: The day Steam went live in 2003, we were in Colony at RIT, September 12th, 2003, 17 years ago.

662
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:29,460
Scott: The day Steam went live is also the day I made a Steam account.

663
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:30,930
Rym: Because Steam did one thing.

664
00:49:31,292 --> 00:49:32,500
Rym: It updated Counter-Strike.

665
00:49:33,601 --> 00:49:33,922
Scott: Right.

666
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:36,974
Scott: Steam did not let you buy games.

667
00:49:36,994 --> 00:49:38,500
Scott: It was not a store at that time.

668
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:56,780
Scott: It was a system to replace WAN to help you find servers to play games on, to launch games, and to update those games, keep them updated, because the system before then was when there's a Counter-Strike update, you have to go to a website and download files and run them.

669
00:49:57,365 --> 00:49:58,080
Scott: It was a pain in the ass.

670
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:01,859
Rym: But basically you had to type your CD key into Steam for Steam to work.

671
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:07,420
Rym: And you needed a CD key to play Half-Life, or to play Counter-Strike, or any mod.

672
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:09,790
Scott: There were no other games on Steam yet, right?

673
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:16,253
Scott: So I installed Steam, the original version of Steam, and I typed in my Half-Life 1 CD key, and appeared in.

674
00:50:16,353 --> 00:50:25,140
Scott: Steam were not only Half-Life, but also Half-Life Deathmatch, Day of Defeat, and some other things, and Ricochet was there.

675
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:30,780
Scott: And that's when I discovered the existence of Ricochet in 2003, because I could just right-click and install it for free.

676
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:37,629
Scott: But today, apparently, if you want Ricochet, it's on Steam, it totally works, or else we wouldn't be talking about it.

677
00:50:37,931 --> 00:50:39,160
Scott: They want to charge you five bucks.

678
00:50:40,267 --> 00:50:41,258
Scott: Which, eh, might be worth it.

679
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:48,459
Scott: I guess you could technically pay five bucks for a Ricochet only and not even have Half-Life 1 now.

680
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:49,583
Rym: Can you?

681
00:50:50,307 --> 00:50:52,559
Rym: I didn't actually look at Steam to see if that would work, because this is...

682
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:54,640
Scott: Yeah, I think it's its own game, right?

683
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:55,124
Scott: It's its own game.

684
00:50:55,165 --> 00:50:58,421
Rym: I guess it comes with Half-Life 1.

685
00:50:58,421 --> 00:50:58,864
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

686
00:50:58,904 --> 00:51:01,580
Scott: If you buy Half-Life 1 on Steam, I don't know if you get Ricochet.

687
00:51:02,121 --> 00:51:10,060
Rym: What I don't know either, can I, with my Steam Half-Life 1, which I also own, could I just install the Ricochet mod directly?

688
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:12,103
Scott: That's a good question.

689
00:51:12,123 --> 00:51:20,520
Scott: The point is, it still exists, and we still have our legacy copies that were grandfathered in from the original Day of Steam, right?

690
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:25,700
Scott: And having those Half-Life 1 CD keys means that I have Half-Life 1 on Steam as a game, right?

691
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:28,128
Scott: It's just that copy from 1990-whatever that I had a CD for.

692
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:34,281
Scott: It's just been grandfathered all the way right up to 2020.

693
00:51:34,281 --> 00:51:37,200
Rym: I used a pirated CD key at the time, and it totally worked.

694
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:53,820
Scott: Oh, my CD key was not necessarily pirated, but some kid in high school gave me a CD-R copy of his actual CD, and he wrote his CD key on a piece of paper, and that's what I've been using this whole time.

695
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:57,593
Rym: Yep, I had a similar situation, because a lot of people-- I never bought Half-Life 1.

696
00:51:57,593 --> 00:51:58,560
Scott: I didn't pay 50 bucks for it.

697
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:01,420
Rym: Because remember, back then, most people did not play games online.

698
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:07,140
Rym: So, the CD key, most people didn't need it after they got Half-Life working on their computer.

699
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:17,178
Rym: The CD key only became a problem if I used someone else's CD key to register a game online, and then someone else tried to do it, and Steam said, "No, that was already

700
00:52:17,218 --> 00:52:17,480
Rym: done.".

701
00:52:18,082 --> 00:52:22,900
Scott: No, it actually didn't, because you could reinstall the game with your same CD key over and over, right?

702
00:52:23,081 --> 00:52:24,579
Scott: It couldn't tell if you had just moved.

703
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:28,520
Rym: Oh, that's true, but I'm saying if you tried-- You didn't have an account associated with the key or anything.

704
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:33,460
Rym: If you tried to register it with Steam on a different account, I remember there was a problem.

705
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:41,840
Scott: Once we had accounts, before then there weren't accounts, so the key was just the key, and as soon as I obviously typed that key into Steam before that other kid did.

706
00:52:42,141 --> 00:52:42,460
Rym: Yep, same.

707
00:52:44,222 --> 00:52:48,936
Rym: So, in RIT, we noticed this, and we're like, "Oh, Ricochet, what's that?

708
00:52:49,377 --> 00:52:50,120
Rym: Let's play

709
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:50,180
Rym: it.".

710
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:54,520
Rym: And we played it, and we got kind of obsessed with it, and we played it a lot.

711
00:52:55,800 --> 00:53:05,160
Scott: So, Ricochet, we did actually do an episode about this before, but we Googled, we searched our own database to try to find that episode, and I couldn't find it.

712
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:08,798
Scott: And then a good listener, Naito, was like, "Aha, I found

713
00:53:08,838 --> 00:53:08,879
Scott: it!".

714
00:53:09,301 --> 00:53:20,560
Scott: Apparently the episode was titled "Tron Games, Games of Tron," because we also talked about Disks of Tron, and GL Tron, Tron Bikes, right?

715
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:21,835
Scott: All the other games of Tron.

716
00:53:23,721 --> 00:53:28,120
Scott: Because Ricochet basically is an unlicensed Disks of Tron FPS.

717
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,660
Scott: I don't know why there's never been an official one, it makes no sense.

718
00:53:32,081 --> 00:53:34,540
Scott: I don't know why there isn't one in VR, it makes no sense.

719
00:53:35,122 --> 00:53:41,800
Rym: Yeah, I want to just install the Unreal Engine, or even just Unity, and just make Ricochet 2.

720
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:52,328
Scott: Right, for whatever you want, I mean, you can probably go back to that episode on Games of Tron, I'm curious if I say the same thing in that episode, which is, by the way, I feel okay repeating that episode, because that episode is from like 2006, maybe?

721
00:53:52,348 --> 00:53:53,779
Scott: It's like a super old episode.

722
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,006
Rym: Yeah, it was a long time ago.

723
00:53:55,408 --> 00:53:57,760
Rym: In fact, it was from, no, 2009.

724
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,536
Scott: Oh, it's 2009, it's an 11-year-old episode.

725
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:03,560
Rym: Tuesday, August 8th, 2009, the news on this episode.

726
00:54:04,461 --> 00:54:08,320
Rym: Tonight on Gig Nights, we honor the upcoming movie, Tron Legacy.

727
00:54:09,362 --> 00:54:10,500
Scott: Which I rewatched recently.

728
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:14,520
Rym: By discussing various video games based on the world of Tron, so we did cover a ton of Tron games.

729
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:21,160
Rym: In the news, the slim PS3 is official, some MMO problem, and PAX is coming.

730
00:54:21,961 --> 00:54:22,141
Scott: Yep.

731
00:54:23,284 --> 00:54:40,720
Scott: So, I'm curious if I said this in that episode, which I haven't really listened to, but basically, for whatever else you want to say about Tron, you can talk about Tron for days, is that the games they portrayed in Tron the Movie are basically the greatest possible games.

732
00:54:42,463 --> 00:54:43,927
Rym: They are legit good games.

733
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:47,800
Rym: I like playing versions of these games people have made.

734
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:49,065
Rym: I have my entire life.

735
00:54:49,125 --> 00:54:51,155
Scott: I was playing the hell out of Snafu on the television.

736
00:54:52,500 --> 00:55:07,220
Scott: For as good as they were at making movies, some game designer who worked on Tron the Movie came up with the Tron disc throwing game, the murder Hyli game, and the bike game.

737
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:09,875
Scott: Someone came up with those games as part of making a movie.

738
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:12,760
Scott: Those games did not exist before that movie.

739
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:30,420
Scott: And every one of those games is this genius, incredible game that is better than the majority of games that actually exist today, at least as far as competitive multiplayer games that couldn't exist in real life as sports exist and would require some sort of digital addition.

740
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:42,336
Rym: So before we actually review this game, what I will point out is that the only reason we're talking about it is recently, like last week, Scott just messaged me and he's like, "Hey, Ricochet is just on Steam.

741
00:55:42,357 --> 00:55:43,199
Rym: I wonder if it'll just

742
00:55:43,259 --> 00:55:43,459
Rym: work.".

743
00:55:43,901 --> 00:55:47,516
Rym: And then a few minutes later, he messaged me and he's like, "It just works.

744
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:48,319
Rym: I'm in

745
00:55:48,359 --> 00:55:48,540
Rym: Ricochet.".

746
00:55:48,661 --> 00:55:49,545
Rym: It almost just works.

747
00:55:49,565 --> 00:55:54,339
Scott: You have to adjust a few settings because there were some bugs with your mouse flipping out all over the place.

748
00:55:54,501 --> 00:55:57,020
Rym: Mouse input to raw because this game is unchanged.

749
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:02,560
Scott: You go to the settings menu and it's like enable raw mouse input and then suddenly it works great.

750
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,712
Scott: And also you have to find a server that wasn't laggy.

751
00:56:05,753 --> 00:56:07,851
Scott: I think the first server we... There were servers that were up.

752
00:56:07,911 --> 00:56:08,679
Scott: No one was playing on them.

753
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:11,630
Rym: Dude, just before this, GeekNights, I logged in.

754
00:56:12,112 --> 00:56:14,380
Rym: I just started Ricochet because I wanted to grab a screenshot.

755
00:56:15,041 --> 00:56:19,140
Rym: And there were non-bots just playing on one of the servers, just regular human beings.

756
00:56:19,742 --> 00:56:22,232
Scott: So it's not a completely dead game.

757
00:56:22,312 --> 00:56:24,280
Scott: It's like there are ridiculously...

758
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:30,480
Rym: There are 11 servers in the browser right now that are all up and two of them have people in them.

759
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:39,212
Scott: Yeah, it's like there are not... There's like a very small handful of people in the world who kind of play... Like when I looked, when we played, there were zero people playing.

760
00:56:39,554 --> 00:56:41,000
Scott: But there is people playing this.

761
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:42,599
Scott: You can get games of this going.

762
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:47,580
Rym: Well, we started playing with the listeners and then someone who wasn't one of us joined the game.

763
00:56:48,142 --> 00:56:53,599
Scott: Yeah, it was like us and listeners playing and then suddenly player one joined and we were like, "Who is

764
00:56:53,619 --> 00:56:53,780
Scott: that?".

765
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:55,448
Scott: And it wasn't anyone we were talking to.

766
00:56:55,468 --> 00:56:57,919
Scott: So someone joined from nowhere.

767
00:56:57,939 --> 00:56:58,120
Scott: Who knows?

768
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:02,700
Rym: I imagine someone's just sitting there watching that browser just waiting for someone to join a Ricochet game.

769
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:03,420
Rym: That's their whole life.

770
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:06,475
Scott: So this game, which is 20 years old, right?

771
00:57:06,495 --> 00:57:09,020
Scott: You said it came out in 2000?

772
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:14,680
Scott: Has more... Like if you try to play some other games online that have, you know, like, I don't know, Nidhogg.

773
00:57:15,162 --> 00:57:18,760
Scott: Like when we tried to play Nidhogg online at its height, we would have trouble finding opponents.

774
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:25,060
Rym: When I played Nidhogg online a couple weeks after its height, when it was in the decline, it was at the point to where I fought one guy.

775
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:25,561
Rym: I beat him.

776
00:57:25,943 --> 00:57:26,685
Rym: I fought someone else.

777
00:57:26,766 --> 00:57:27,227
Rym: I beat them.

778
00:57:27,829 --> 00:57:29,154
Rym: Then I fought the first person again.

779
00:57:29,616 --> 00:57:30,680
Rym: Then the second person again.

780
00:57:30,921 --> 00:57:33,740
Rym: There were only three people in the world playing Nidhogg.

781
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:34,801
Scott: Right.

782
00:57:35,142 --> 00:57:37,875
Scott: So Ricochet, though, after 20 years, people are playing this game.

783
00:57:38,338 --> 00:57:38,820
Scott: Not a lot.

784
00:57:39,721 --> 00:57:43,240
Scott: But I would recommend if you're going to want to play it online, you find people to play with.

785
00:57:43,381 --> 00:57:45,358
Scott: I also don't know if I'll pay five bucks.

786
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:51,439
Rym: There is a SuperPichu and the Ginkgoz Discord has posted a dedicated server for all of us.

787
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:52,501
Scott: Yeah.

788
00:57:52,521 --> 00:57:55,160
Scott: So come to the Ginkgoz Discord and come play Ricochet with us.

789
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:56,565
Scott: So what's the deal with Ricochet?

790
00:57:56,625 --> 00:58:00,720
Scott: Ricochet is a first person shooting competitive multiplayer game.

791
00:58:01,181 --> 00:58:03,159
Rym: But with extreme minimalism.

792
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:04,181
Scott: Yes.

793
00:58:04,382 --> 00:58:04,563
Scott: It is.

794
00:58:04,583 --> 00:58:06,895
Scott: I mean, it probably took Valve, right, 20 years ago.

795
00:58:08,603 --> 00:58:10,860
Scott: Like not a long amount of time to slap this thing together.

796
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:13,659
Rym: The game design doctor, this could not be more than one page.

797
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:14,581
Scott: Right.

798
00:58:14,601 --> 00:58:17,960
Scott: The hardest part about making a Half-Life 1 mod especially is the map.

799
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:23,560
Scott: And the maps are small and only have a few components and textures and they are repeated.

800
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:30,060
Rym: There are four maps and actually the fourth one I had never seen until this past weekend.

801
00:58:31,242 --> 00:58:31,422
Scott: Yeah.

802
00:58:32,407 --> 00:58:34,980
Scott: And what it is is it's basically Discs of Tron.

803
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:36,571
Scott: You are a Tron dude.

804
00:58:36,752 --> 00:58:37,759
Scott: You can't even jump.

805
00:58:38,761 --> 00:58:44,960
Scott: You have your controls are WASD to move, mouse to look around, and you can click to throw a disc.

806
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:46,960
Rym: Primary attack and secondary attack.

807
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:51,380
Rym: And while you can look around, you can only shoot straight forward like Doom style.

808
00:58:51,741 --> 00:58:51,802
Scott: Yes.

809
00:58:51,822 --> 00:58:53,020
Scott: You can't crouch, right.

810
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:58,900
Scott: Your disc will, even if you're looking up at the sky, your disc will go straight at the same elevation at which you are standing.

811
00:58:59,501 --> 00:58:59,702
Scott: Right.

812
00:58:59,722 --> 00:59:04,100
Scott: So if you're on a high up platform, it's going to shoot, you know, up there on that level.

813
00:59:04,422 --> 00:59:06,779
Scott: If you're on a lower platform, it's going to shoot at that low level.

814
00:59:09,082 --> 00:59:14,220
Scott: You can step on these arrows on the edge of the platforms and they will automatically bounce you.

815
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:16,519
Scott: You can't jump, they bounce you when you step on them.

816
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:22,340
Scott: And they are calibrated perfectly so that if you step on one, you're going to land on the platform you're heading towards.

817
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:24,474
Rym: As long as you don't touch any directional input.

818
00:59:24,494 --> 00:59:25,239
Rym: We'll get back to that.

819
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:26,201
Scott: Right.

820
00:59:27,085 --> 00:59:30,540
Scott: So you just use WASD, walk around, you'll go from platform to platform.

821
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:36,840
Scott: If you throw a disc while you're jumping, then it's unlikely to hit anyone because it's only people who are on that exact level.

822
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:39,860
Scott: Our people are also jumping and it's going to be really hard to hit anyone like that.

823
00:59:40,081 --> 00:59:41,431
Rym: Yeah, but if you're good, you're good.

824
00:59:41,511 --> 00:59:42,780
Rym: I've killed some people in midair.

825
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:47,940
Scott: The secondary attack, so the discs that you throw, right, if they hit someone, they don't kill them.

826
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:51,540
Scott: They just sort of nudge them and you're trying to nudge them off the platform so they die.

827
00:59:52,043 --> 00:59:52,658
Scott: It's murder disc.

828
00:59:53,461 --> 00:59:56,600
Scott: If you use the secondary attack, it uses all three of your discs.

829
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:59,219
Scott: So if you don't have three discs at the moment, you can't use it.

830
00:59:59,861 --> 01:00:03,900
Scott: It throws a chainsaw blade that if it hits someone, decapitates them and they die instantly.

831
01:00:04,901 --> 01:00:05,987
Scott: Yeah, so that's pretty good.

832
01:00:06,007 --> 01:00:08,680
Scott: It's really good close up when you're not going to miss with that.

833
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:10,254
Scott: Because if you shoot it and miss, guess what?

834
01:00:10,274 --> 01:00:10,819
Scott: You're out of discs.

835
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:14,820
Rym: So there's also little walls all around the map, but they're tiny.

836
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:19,540
Rym: Like they're just at the points where if you're standing on a platform, they will catch a disc and disc will bounce off of them.

837
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:21,760
Rym: You get two points per kill.

838
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:22,440
Scott: That's the ricocheting.

839
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:30,000
Rym: If you kill someone with a ricochet and you get three points for a kill if you kill someone with a two plus bounce ricochet.

840
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:33,180
Scott: Yeah, so that's where the name ricochet comes from, right?

841
01:00:33,321 --> 01:00:34,311
Rym: That's where the skill is.

842
01:00:34,351 --> 01:00:35,098
Rym: That's how you get good.

843
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:41,880
Scott: You want the disc to bounce off the wall and then hit somebody and knock them off the platform.

844
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:50,120
Scott: And it's like, not only do you have to calculate the angles like billiards of like, I throw the disc here, it's going to bounce off that, then bounce off that and then go there.

845
01:00:50,781 --> 01:00:54,839
Scott: You also have to calculate, you look at someone and you don't want to shoot it where they are.

846
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:57,920
Scott: You want to shoot it where they're going to be.

847
01:00:58,222 --> 01:01:00,020
Scott: Like in Space Invaders, right?

848
01:01:00,482 --> 01:01:03,679
Scott: So you have to say, all right, well, there's Rym, he's moving, where's he going to be?

849
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:09,520
Scott: Throw a disc so it bounces twice and then is where Rym is going to be when he gets there.

850
01:01:09,924 --> 01:01:10,920
Scott: That is ridiculous.

851
01:01:11,121 --> 01:01:16,700
Scott: Like for such a tiny game, the skill to do that is the cap is so high.

852
01:01:17,083 --> 01:01:18,660
Rym: Yeah, this is a dive kick situation.

853
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:22,419
Rym: There's so few mechanics and so little to engage with in this game.

854
01:01:22,841 --> 01:01:26,140
Rym: Yet the skill barrier is immense.

855
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:31,900
Rym: You could practice this game for a long time and not be a god at it.

856
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:32,580
Scott: Right.

857
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:44,320
Scott: And also just the awareness you need while playing to also dodge discs, right, is like this whole arena, but you can only see your FOV at once and discs are flying and bouncing and the other character is somewhere.

858
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:54,260
Scott: So you not only have to maintain the awareness of where you are, where your discs are going, what discs you have, if there's a power up in the middle that appears and gives you better discs occasionally.

859
01:01:55,241 --> 01:02:00,800
Rym: There's like an ice shot, auto decapitator, a homing shot and a fast shot and a triple shot.

860
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:04,537
Scott: I think the homing shot is the ice shot or no, are they two different ones?

861
01:02:04,577 --> 01:02:05,020
Scott: It doesn't matter.

862
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:05,627
Rym: I don't remember.

863
01:02:05,668 --> 01:02:06,540
Scott: I don't think about it that much.

864
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:09,047
Scott: Anyway, the point is you got to maintain awareness of all these things.

865
01:02:09,449 --> 01:02:13,200
Scott: with a very small FOV, right, and you could die at any moment.

866
01:02:14,301 --> 01:02:18,531
Scott: So it's like this game as a game, like technologically.

867
01:02:18,611 --> 01:02:19,253
Scott: does it hold up?

868
01:02:19,293 --> 01:02:20,195
Scott: I mean, it still works.

869
01:02:20,256 --> 01:02:21,078
Scott: It doesn't look great.

870
01:02:21,118 --> 01:02:22,140
Scott: It looks like Half Life 1.

871
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:23,340
Rym: It looks janky as hell.

872
01:02:24,124 --> 01:02:27,460
Scott: Yeah, but it still plays just fine.

873
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:28,663
Rym: It's a compelling game.

874
01:02:28,723 --> 01:02:30,588
Rym: Like the game loop is compelling.

875
01:02:30,909 --> 01:02:34,960
Rym: When we started playing again, we just kept playing for hours because it was super fun.

876
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:40,615
Scott: The game design is timeless and offers crap tons of replay value, right?

877
01:02:40,635 --> 01:02:42,080
Scott: That's something that someone came up with.

878
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:45,024
Scott: I guess Tron the movie came out when I was born.

879
01:02:45,064 --> 01:02:46,207
Scott: basically, right?

880
01:02:46,287 --> 01:02:53,100
Scott: A game that someone thought of then is still an amazing game today, better than a lot of multiplayer competitive games you can get.

881
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:59,712
Scott: I think it's like maybe Rocket League is on this level again in terms of goodness, right?

882
01:02:59,813 --> 01:03:03,720
Scott: Just based on the game alone, this is Rocket League level of goodness.

883
01:03:04,681 --> 01:03:09,754
Rym: Now, part of what makes it so great is that it has a deathmatch mode where everyone is just in a map.

884
01:03:09,794 --> 01:03:11,058
Rym: The map is for deathmatch.

885
01:03:11,278 --> 01:03:11,900
Rym: Just free for all.

886
01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:14,087
Scott: The deathmatch maps are big.

887
01:03:14,127 --> 01:03:18,120
Scott: They have multiple tiers where you're going up and down to different levels of platforms.

888
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:19,903
Rym: The best map is the duel.

889
01:03:20,143 --> 01:03:31,140
Rym: It'll just take all the players on however many people are in the server, divide them up into groups of two, and you all simultaneously on your own duel one other person for like a best of three or a best of five.

890
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:36,230
Scott: And then, once your match is done, you just watch other people.

891
01:03:36,510 --> 01:03:39,578
Rym: Once all the matches are done, it rotates everyone like Swiss style.

892
01:03:39,859 --> 01:03:40,300
Rym: Play again.

893
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:42,522
Scott: It's just like a round robin.

894
01:03:42,803 --> 01:03:53,000
Scott: You get into one-on-one duels with everyone, and since the map for that is so small and so simple, even the Half-Life server can spawn several copies of the map all at once because it's such a tiny map.

895
01:03:53,621 --> 01:03:57,240
Scott: You could spawn up like ten of those maps, it still wouldn't be as big as Dust 1 or whatever.

896
01:03:57,340 --> 01:04:04,291
Rym: And it is such a game of concentration and bluffing and counter bluffing and anticipating your opponent and faking.

897
01:04:04,832 --> 01:04:10,241
Rym: It's a really surprisingly intense experience for a mod of Half-Life from the year 2000.

898
01:04:10,241 --> 01:04:16,573
Scott: And because the biggest thing is that this is not Counter-Strike, you click on a head and you got 'em.

899
01:04:16,774 --> 01:04:21,002
Scott: You throw a disc, much more like another great game, Tribes 2.

900
01:04:21,002 --> 01:04:22,410
Scott: You throw a disc.

901
01:04:22,591 --> 01:04:24,199
Scott: The disc, you can see it moving.

902
01:04:24,421 --> 01:04:25,240
Rym: Or Windjammers.

903
01:04:26,761 --> 01:04:29,591
Scott: It's a lot more like Doom, where an imp throws a fireball at you.

904
01:04:29,652 --> 01:04:31,840
Scott: You see it, you strafe to the left to dodge it.

905
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:38,360
Rym: But you strafe to the left, but they'd already thrown a disc in the other direction that bounced and is now headed for that position because they're good.

906
01:04:39,301 --> 01:04:42,650
Scott: Right, they threw a disc, it's bouncing, then they threw a disc straight at you.

907
01:04:42,890 --> 01:04:46,560
Scott: You dodge to the side and thus they control where you are moving.

908
01:04:47,020 --> 01:04:49,733
Scott: And oh look, you've moved to where the first disc was going to be.

909
01:04:52,502 --> 01:04:59,140
Scott: If I can't predict where a Rym is going to be, I can influence where a Rym is going to be to help my shot that I've already thrown previously.

910
01:04:59,140 --> 01:05:07,780
Rym: Or maybe I see what Scott did, I'm bluffing and I turn around and threw a disc through one of those teleporters and I know it's going to come straight back into my face just as Scott comes to kill me.

911
01:05:10,941 --> 01:05:19,540
Rym: But the thing, like, remember way back when we said you jump from these platforms and they're calibrated to take you to whatever platform they're pointed at, like that's fine.

912
01:05:20,421 --> 01:05:25,500
Rym: If you move your WASD while you're in flight, you can control your flight.

913
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:27,507
Rym: 99% of the time.

914
01:05:27,547 --> 01:05:29,559
Rym: if you do that you'll just die because you'll just fall off the map.

915
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:37,380
Scott: Right, if you touch an arrow with your feet and it goes bonk and you hear that bonk noise that indicates that it is now launching you through the air to the next platform.

916
01:05:39,161 --> 01:05:46,560
Scott: You do not want to press any of the WASD keys because you will likely, if you touch any of them while you're in flight, will make you fall in the hole and die.

917
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:50,520
Rym: But this is where the skill caps start to come in and why this game's skill cap is so high.

918
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:57,580
Rym: Because if you are good, one thing you can do is bounce off of something but hold forward and land right back on the same bouncer.

919
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:11,540
Scott: Yep, it is technically possible that if you press the WASDs in the correct way with good manipulation, there's no jump button, you can guide yourself through the air and land in a place that is not the pit of death.

920
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:12,779
Rym: But a different platform.

921
01:06:13,780 --> 01:06:17,180
Scott: Yes, not the platform you were normally supposed to go to.

922
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:19,060
Rym: It could be the same platform.

923
01:06:19,681 --> 01:06:34,320
Scott: It could be, so you step on an arrow, it makes a bonk noise, your opponent sees where you were, they now think you're going to platform X, you actually land on platform Y, they threw discs that ricocheted over to platform X, they don't have discs right now.

924
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:38,959
Scott: You're on platform Y, looking at them, they're looking somewhere else.

925
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:51,420
Rym: That's subtle, different, the fact that you can with a high skill maneuver, it's not frame perfect, it's not that bad, but it requires a significant amount of practice and skill.

926
01:06:52,120 --> 01:07:00,479
Rym: That opens up so many tactical possibilities, that alone probably quadruples the depth of this game if you actually try to get good at it.

927
01:07:02,244 --> 01:07:07,920
Scott: You can even tell that the maps were arranged to allow this intentionally, at least I believe so.

928
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:08,797
Rym: I believe this too.

929
01:07:10,501 --> 01:07:29,520
Scott: In the dual arena, there's the two central platforms with a little connector, if you go onto one and you just sort of naturally try to wrap yourself around off the jump to land on the other central platform instead of the outside platform, you sort of line up with the arrow on the destination platform.

930
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:47,117
Scott: It's measured so perfectly, and there's no way that that's just a coincidence, that performing this wraparound maneuver that feels like an accident of the game, the way that a rocket jump was an accident of Quake or whatever, lands you so perfectly on the other platform.

931
01:07:49,980 --> 01:08:00,977
Scott: It's not like you're landing on the bare edge of it and managing to stay on with a trick or something like that, or a bomb jump in Zelda that you're jumping over a gap where it seems unintentional.

932
01:08:01,237 --> 01:08:03,120
Scott: It feels intentional when you do it.

933
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:08,593
Rym: So what I would say, one, if you check your Steam library, there's decent odds.

934
01:08:08,633 --> 01:08:11,520
Rym: you already own Ricochet, whether or not you even realize it.

935
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:15,440
Scott: If your Steam account is old, it is likely you have the game Ricochet.

936
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:22,470
Rym: And if you do, honestly, install it, turn on Raw Mouse, because otherwise it won't work, most likely, and then just play.

937
01:08:22,770 --> 01:08:23,331
Rym: There's servers.

938
01:08:23,952 --> 01:08:25,154
Rym: Come to our Discord and join the server.

939
01:08:25,535 --> 01:08:26,576
Rym: It is worth playing this game.

940
01:08:26,595 --> 01:08:27,778
Rym: For $0, this game is 100% worth playing.

941
01:08:29,779 --> 01:08:33,357
Scott: Yeah, I don't know if I would spend $5, not because the game itself is not $5 good.

942
01:08:34,180 --> 01:08:36,359
Rym: Because it is $5 good, I'm gonna say that.

943
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:40,319
Scott: But will you actually be able to play it enough to make up your $5?

944
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:49,219
Rym: What I would recommend is come join the GeekNights Discord and maybe watch us playing, and decide if you want to join in on that fun or not.

945
01:08:53,125 --> 01:08:55,874
Scott: How often are we actually gonna be playing Ricochet?

946
01:08:55,895 --> 01:08:56,938
Scott: Like once in a while?

947
01:08:57,019 --> 01:08:57,399
Rym: I don't know.

948
01:08:57,700 --> 01:09:02,288
Rym: I could see myself playing this every few nights, but I don't know if I'll do that forever.

949
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:04,573
Rym: But it's gonna be a long, cold winter.

950
01:09:04,594 --> 01:09:07,540
Rym: I'm gonna be playing a lot of online games, I think, during COVID times.

951
01:09:08,881 --> 01:09:14,779
Scott: Yeah, I mean, like I said, I can't guarantee how productive I will be during these non-working periods.

952
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:17,618
Scott: But I can absolutely guarantee I'll be just playing some fucking video games.

953
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:32,399
Rym: So, if you are an aspiring game developer or designer, especially a designer, even if you don't own this game, buy it and play it, and really try to internalize how much it does with so little.

954
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:45,899
Scott: If you are working at a game studio that is making any kind of competitive multiplayer real-time game whatsoever, you should get your team together and play Ricochet for an afternoon or for an hour or something.

955
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:50,279
Rym: Like, if I was teaching game design in school, I would assign Ricochet to the class.

956
01:09:52,041 --> 01:09:53,323
Scott: I would assign games of Tron.

957
01:09:53,363 --> 01:09:55,829
Scott: I'd be like, "We're gonna split the class into three groups.

958
01:09:56,009 --> 01:10:00,439
Scott: One group is gonna make Murder Hyli, one group is gonna make Ricochet, and one group is gonna make

959
01:10:00,479 --> 01:10:00,759
Scott: bikes.".

960
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:01,253
Scott: Alright.

961
01:10:03,461 --> 01:10:03,842
Rym: Alright.

962
01:10:04,463 --> 01:10:10,080
Rym: And if you're interested, I'll link to the ancient episode we did on all those Tron games, and I wonder if we said anything different about Ricochet.

963
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:13,140
Rym: It'll be really funny if we said the exact same things.

964
01:10:13,661 --> 01:10:15,119
Scott: Someone else go listen and tell us.

965
01:10:21,131 --> 01:10:23,397
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

966
01:10:23,437 --> 01:10:28,410
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

967
01:10:28,790 --> 01:10:33,810
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

968
01:10:34,091 --> 01:10:36,758
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

969
01:10:36,898 --> 01:10:41,470
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

970
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:45,026
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

971
01:10:46,330 --> 01:10:49,360
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

972
01:10:49,561 --> 01:10:52,450
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

973
01:10:53,270 --> 01:11:01,030
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights are Alan Joyce, Heidi McNichol, Marty Green, Graham Finch, you hold the key to my heart.

974
01:11:01,370 --> 01:11:03,253
Rym: So I yelled at the cab, "Yo holmes, smell ya

975
01:11:03,293 --> 01:11:03,554
Rym: later!".

976
01:11:03,774 --> 01:11:14,610
Rym: Clinton Walton, Ren from New Zealand, Ryan Parry, Chris Minkoff, Dread, Lily Tenebrae, just like a dude guy, Chris Reimer, Finn, Trevor Van Horl, and a whole bunch of people who do not want me to say their names.

977
01:11:15,532 --> 01:11:18,029
Rym: This is stuck in my head, so it can be stuck in your head too.

978
01:12:10,490 --> 01:12:10,911
Rym: [Music].
