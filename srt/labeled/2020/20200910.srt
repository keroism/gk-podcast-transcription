1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,383
Rym: It's Thursday September 10th 2020.

2
00:00:12,383 --> 00:00:12,864
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,405 --> 00:00:16,053
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:16,113 --> 00:00:19,638
Rym: We are reviewing the fantastic film Parasite.

5
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:32,800
Scott: Let's do this All right, so you may or may not know if you'd listen to the opening bits or whatever that since you know I can't go outside as much these days.

6
00:00:33,683 --> 00:00:37,113
Scott: I've been biking inside and I set up a little streaming thing.

7
00:00:37,213 --> 00:00:37,975
Scott: so is with.

8
00:00:38,076 --> 00:00:43,713
Rym: I did find some stuff I can do because our bike is really cheap, but the sensor like the computer stuff.

9
00:00:43,773 --> 00:00:47,817
Rym: I can just plug it into a better device Mmm, so I'm looking into that.

10
00:00:48,373 --> 00:00:51,125
Scott: Yeah I actually Learned yesterday that I can.

11
00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:58,489
Scott: actually there was a way to use my Apple watch as heart rate monitor to connect to the Zwift So I tried it.

12
00:00:58,630 --> 00:00:59,895
Scott: It looked like it was working.

13
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:00,960
Scott: I don't know how accurate is.

14
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:09,132
Scott: It feels like it has a delay because if you look at the the graphs of like wattage verse heart rate Like what goes up in the heart rate goes up like a. what goes up?

15
00:01:09,232 --> 00:01:11,607
Scott: it goes down then the heart rate goes up Just after.

16
00:01:11,627 --> 00:01:12,697
Scott: yeah, it's like though.

17
00:01:13,442 --> 00:01:19,787
Rym: so one thing you have to bear in mind is that heart rates like your heart doesn't react instantly and Like ramping up and slowing.

18
00:01:19,828 --> 00:01:20,953
Scott: I don't know anything about her.

19
00:01:21,234 --> 00:01:24,560
Scott: It's that's like the first time my whole life I've tracked heart rate while exercising.

20
00:01:25,102 --> 00:01:32,104
Rym: so the one thing that you might find interesting that this is something you can watch for in the data regardless of that is The way to tell.

21
00:01:32,305 --> 00:01:36,260
Rym: if your heart is getting like athlete conditioned is a very specific thing that happens.

22
00:01:36,701 --> 00:01:38,166
Rym: And the thing is normal people.

23
00:01:38,868 --> 00:01:42,038
Rym: when you exercise your heart rate goes up right like if you work harder.

24
00:01:42,058 --> 00:01:48,600
Rym: it beats faster When you stop exercising or slow down, it doesn't just slow back down right away.

25
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,592
Rym: It actually takes it a while like it'll slow down very slowly.

26
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,520
Rym: Your body's like, I don't know if he's done yet.

27
00:01:54,104 --> 00:01:54,910
Rym: Let's be ready.

28
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:56,100
Rym: Keep beating keep beating.

29
00:01:56,522 --> 00:02:04,899
Scott: But if you actually train a lot and like get past the point of just being like a normal person Well, I don't think I don't think Zwift is gonna detect that because it stops tracking as soon as they push and exercise.

30
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:11,722
Rym: So when I do stuff I always leave my things tracking for like a minute or two after I'm done so I can see the drop Off.

31
00:02:12,287 --> 00:02:14,080
Scott: Yeah, I don't know if it's anyway, I'll look at it.

32
00:02:14,481 --> 00:02:19,880
Rym: But basically what is if your heart drops like right back to 60 like within 30 seconds of stopping biking.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,334
Rym: That means you you basically have the heart of a pro athlete like you've done it.

34
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:24,800
Scott: Yeah, I don't think that's happening.

35
00:02:25,203 --> 00:02:27,340
Rym: If you keep biking at the right year, that might happen.

36
00:02:28,263 --> 00:02:29,920
Scott: It's not that it's not biking very hard.

37
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,494
Rym: Yeah, well, I guess you'd have to do intervals which I imagine you will never do.

38
00:02:33,594 --> 00:02:35,000
Scott: I think it might be doing intervals.

39
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,718
Scott: I'm doing whatever the thing says to do right, but it's you know, you know, what intervals are.

40
00:02:39,381 --> 00:02:40,849
Scott: It's you work hard, then you don't work hard.

41
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:41,111
Scott: Yep.

42
00:02:41,191 --> 00:02:42,156
Scott: It's like work hard again.

43
00:02:42,377 --> 00:02:44,286
Rym: run so hard It hurts for a few minutes.

44
00:02:44,568 --> 00:02:45,452
Scott: then I don't do that.

45
00:02:45,653 --> 00:02:47,200
Rym: slow down and jog for like five.

46
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:52,904
Scott: I mean it's basically like all right do this many watts and I'm like, ooh, that's a lot of watts It's more than just.

47
00:02:53,004 --> 00:02:54,571
Scott: it's more than just chillin, right?

48
00:02:54,932 --> 00:02:59,597
Scott: But then it's like, okay go back to just chillin All right, a lot of watts again, but I don't do so many.

49
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:03,300
Scott: it hurts Right because I have my policy of if it hurts don't do that.

50
00:03:03,501 --> 00:03:08,460
Rym: I do spin training where I go to the point of cardiovascular pain on purpose.

51
00:03:09,241 --> 00:03:10,547
Scott: I I do not.

52
00:03:10,748 --> 00:03:12,074
Scott: I mean I'll be I'm not.

53
00:03:12,154 --> 00:03:12,456
Scott: I'm like.

54
00:03:12,476 --> 00:03:16,329
Scott: I don't find Breathing heavily to be uncomfortable or painful.

55
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:23,476
Scott: So it's like yeah, I am breathing heavily and my heart rate goes up But I am in no way in pain if I'm in pain of any kind.

56
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:31,980
Rym: I'm like, oh, yeah I guess it's because there's the difference between like Achy or like tired or exerting versus like ow, there's a pain something's wrong.

57
00:03:32,702 --> 00:03:35,954
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know, if I just breathing heavily, it's like, okay.

58
00:03:35,975 --> 00:03:37,440
Rym: No, if I breathe in it was like waiting.

59
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,827
Scott: It's like oh, what's the big deal?

60
00:03:38,867 --> 00:03:39,973
Scott: That's not a problem.

61
00:03:40,194 --> 00:03:41,259
Scott: I don't care, right?

62
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,733
Rym: So, okay, what do you say that like when you're doing a long bike now that you're good?

63
00:03:45,034 --> 00:03:46,280
Scott: I only did it one time.

64
00:03:47,042 --> 00:03:51,176
Rym: I'm curious because I have data now when I run long distances.

65
00:03:51,437 --> 00:03:54,091
Rym: My heart sits at about 160 to 170 the whole time.

66
00:03:56,381 --> 00:04:04,140
Scott: Aha, so I mean I think if I look at it from yesterday it was like Depending on the wattage, right?

67
00:04:04,641 --> 00:04:05,623
Scott: So it was.

68
00:04:05,683 --> 00:04:08,009
Scott: basically it only got up to one.

69
00:04:08,029 --> 00:04:11,839
Scott: I think the highest was 180 for like a second or two, right?

70
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,768
Scott: It's like they're like little dots in the 180 area.

71
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:28,940
Scott: most of the time it was in the 150 160 zone Right like a little curve lump, right You know, but you could see it going up and down with the based on the wattage that was being demanded, right?

72
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,560
Rym: So the cool thing you can do is there's something called the RPE scales like this one to ten scale.

73
00:04:33,801 --> 00:04:38,519
Rym: That's basically how do you feel and if you remember the number you would put on that scale?

74
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:44,198
Rym: Coupled with the heart rate you can figure out like basically how healthy your heart is like pretty directly.

75
00:04:44,398 --> 00:04:44,880
Rym: It's a cool thing.

76
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,749
Scott: I always feel the same.

77
00:04:46,769 --> 00:04:48,176
Scott: I pretty much have two feelings.

78
00:04:48,236 --> 00:04:50,927
Scott: feeling is My feeling is a just chillin.

79
00:04:50,947 --> 00:04:54,139
Scott: I guess three feelings just chillin up, right?

80
00:04:55,441 --> 00:04:59,496
Scott: Okay, I'm not just chillin, but it doesn't hurt and then that's too much.

81
00:04:59,556 --> 00:05:00,339
Scott: I'm not gonna do that.

82
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:00,640
Scott: All right.

83
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,706
Scott: So I guess three does the three fail.

84
00:05:02,907 --> 00:05:07,159
Rym: one on that scale is hardly any exertion more like watching TV than walking.

85
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,388
Scott: There's definitely less than just chillin.

86
00:05:10,408 --> 00:05:11,351
Rym: like a three is.

87
00:05:11,914 --> 00:05:13,319
Rym: you could do this for hours.

88
00:05:13,882 --> 00:05:18,723
Rym: It's easy to breathe and carry a conversation like a five or six you're breathing That's just.

89
00:05:18,824 --> 00:05:19,607
Scott: that's just chillin.

90
00:05:19,627 --> 00:05:22,880
Rym: Yeah, like a five breathing heavily, but you could still hold a conversation.

91
00:05:23,322 --> 00:05:26,780
Scott: Seven I mean I can hold a conversation, but I have to like stop between words.

92
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,824
Rym: Yep, so they're like a four.

93
00:05:27,924 --> 00:05:29,590
Rym: you could hold a conversation a six.

94
00:05:29,811 --> 00:05:34,732
Rym: you have to like pause like you can have conversations But it's slightly challenging and like you have to say short.

95
00:05:34,772 --> 00:05:34,953
Rym: Yes.

96
00:05:34,993 --> 00:05:37,829
Scott: I don't think I have that That middle one there.

97
00:05:37,869 --> 00:05:43,437
Scott: I pretty much have either just chillin I could do this for hours and then I have to pause there here.

98
00:05:43,498 --> 00:05:48,800
Rym: a seven Borderline Uncomfortable short of breath can speak a sentence.

99
00:05:49,723 --> 00:05:57,418
Rym: I know I don't do seven nine very hard to maintain can barely breathe can speak Maybe a few words at a time.

100
00:05:58,102 --> 00:06:00,410
Scott: Yeah, I don't do maximum effort.

101
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:07,392
Rym: You literally could not push yourself further Even if your life were in danger, you are unable to speak even a single word.

102
00:06:07,693 --> 00:06:09,779
Rym: You cannot maintain this for more than 30 seconds.

103
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:11,820
Scott: Yeah, I don't do any of those.

104
00:06:12,021 --> 00:06:16,119
Rym: I've only experienced that twice in my life and that was in a doctor's office getting a heart test.

105
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,805
Scott: Because basically what happened?

106
00:06:17,825 --> 00:06:30,258
Scott: they made me run until I said 10 and then they immediately stopped the treadmill and I was done when they asked for too much wattage, I just pedal really slowly like And I'm like, all right, we're moving the pedals they're moving.

107
00:06:33,149 --> 00:06:42,140
Scott: No, so an interesting thing happened is Which is the thing that I had heard of before right, but apparently I guess that's the first time it happened to me.

108
00:06:42,321 --> 00:06:42,764
Scott: It's not really.

109
00:06:42,784 --> 00:06:44,437
Scott: it's not really a big deal, right?

110
00:06:46,381 --> 00:06:49,993
Scott: But when I was when I was done, I smelled a weird smell.

111
00:06:50,053 --> 00:06:51,417
Scott: that wasn't a BO smell.

112
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:53,731
Rym: Oh You got into keto.

113
00:06:53,771 --> 00:06:54,999
Rym: It sounds like you're burning fat.

114
00:06:55,752 --> 00:06:56,140
Scott: I don't know.

115
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:04,632
Scott: So then I googled and it's like yeah if you smell like an ammonia smell and I'm like might be an ammonia smell Vaguely, I don't know.

116
00:07:04,652 --> 00:07:15,935
Scott: All right They're like, yeah, that means you know, something something and they're like, yeah They're like, they're like drink more water and I'm like, I already drink the most water.

117
00:07:15,995 --> 00:07:17,580
Scott: I can't possibly drink more water.

118
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,348
Rym: Yeah, you might have to hug fuel more.

119
00:07:20,071 --> 00:07:22,220
Scott: I think that's like yeah, it's like eat more food or something.

120
00:07:22,261 --> 00:07:32,047
Rym: I'm like, okay I actually read in something I always eat During the quarantine like I'm doing these crazy long runs like way more than I used to and I'm like really working out way more Than I ever did so normally.

121
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:42,905
Rym: what would happen is I do a long thing and at some point my body is like out of calories like whatever I've eaten is gone and fat starts getting burned and that causes like your Sweat to smell a certain way.

122
00:07:43,146 --> 00:07:45,633
Rym: You'll like taste this acetone like flavor in your mouth.

123
00:07:45,654 --> 00:07:47,639
Rym: Sometimes there's all sorts of things that happen.

124
00:07:48,261 --> 00:07:59,520
Rym: But if you keep going and you don't have any more fat to burn then you smell this more like acrid Ammonia and other smells like this sour smells and that means that your body's actually starting to break down muscles.

125
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,463
Rym: You're making yourself weaker.

126
00:08:00,483 --> 00:08:02,590
Scott: Yeah, that's not good.

127
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:04,877
Rym: Yeah, but I wasn't even working hard.

128
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:05,579
Scott: I was just chillin.

129
00:08:06,061 --> 00:08:07,106
Rym: Yeah, well, I don't know.

130
00:08:07,126 --> 00:08:09,919
Rym: Maybe maybe you're not eating enough compared to your activity levels.

131
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:12,123
Scott: now I'm not hungry.

132
00:08:12,143 --> 00:08:15,354
Scott: Yeah, I'm eating what I'm hungry and I'm not hungry.

133
00:08:15,475 --> 00:08:16,840
Rym: Yeah, there's a lot of stuff that could be.

134
00:08:17,602 --> 00:08:19,840
Rym: I'd have to smell it, but there's no way I can't.

135
00:08:21,441 --> 00:08:28,479
Scott: Yeah, I don't know whatever but that's just an interesting thing and it's like it's not some unknown thing like those info about on the internet some.

136
00:08:30,523 --> 00:08:34,875
Scott: But yeah, if you if you smell weird after you exercise Google it.

137
00:08:35,966 --> 00:08:37,839
Rym: Yep, so got any news.

138
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:41,908
Scott: Yeah, the sort of a little combo II news here right.

139
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:57,365
Scott: so the movie we've been all been waiting to see for a super long Time right from cartoon saloon the Irish animation studio the makers of the amazing films breadwinner Secret of Kells a Song of the sea.

140
00:08:57,767 --> 00:08:59,433
Scott: right they were making the wolf walkers.

141
00:08:59,453 --> 00:09:01,300
Scott: They were making the wolf walkers for a long time.

142
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,355
Scott: We've been following it very closely right it is actually coming out.

143
00:09:05,456 --> 00:09:10,688
Scott: finally on Saturday two days from now the 12th.

144
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:11,852
Scott: Holy crap.

145
00:09:11,892 --> 00:09:12,735
Scott: It's actually coming out.

146
00:09:12,775 --> 00:09:14,280
Scott: It's for real right.

147
00:09:14,501 --> 00:09:18,737
Scott: We were watching like previews of it and behind the scenes of it like we've been following this thing.

148
00:09:18,818 --> 00:09:19,259
Scott: Oh my god.

149
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:30,660
Scott: So we've also known for a while that they made a deal with Apple like Apple iPhone Apple Right Steve Apple all right Tim Apple.

150
00:09:33,362 --> 00:09:41,998
Scott: So it is going to be on Apple TV Plus which you can either get a free trial if you've got I guess some kind of Apple device or pay five bucks a month right?

151
00:09:43,321 --> 00:09:44,647
Scott: So that's a one way to watch it.

152
00:09:45,129 --> 00:09:47,960
Scott: It's going to be G kids has the license in the u.s.

153
00:09:48,601 --> 00:09:51,280
Scott: Expected, but how you gonna go to a movie theater?

154
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:56,320
Scott: I guess you wait for G kids to make a DVD or go to a drive-in or risk your life to see it.

155
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,103
Scott: I wouldn't do that.

156
00:09:57,806 --> 00:10:00,277
Scott: live in a different country where the movie theater is safer.

157
00:10:00,357 --> 00:10:00,939
Scott: You can do that.

158
00:10:01,603 --> 00:10:03,553
Scott: I'm sure it'll be distributed wherever you live.

159
00:10:03,613 --> 00:10:08,509
Scott: if you're listening to this podcast And I was like damn how am I gonna watch this?

160
00:10:08,569 --> 00:10:09,332
Scott: am I gonna pirate it?

161
00:10:09,393 --> 00:10:11,280
Scott: am I gonna get a free Apple TV trial?

162
00:10:11,401 --> 00:10:13,110
Scott: And try to rip it from Apple TV.

163
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:13,793
Scott: What am I gonna do?

164
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:14,698
Scott: all right?

165
00:10:15,702 --> 00:10:19,672
Scott: Tom Moore the director of the film on Twitter was doing a little.

166
00:10:19,712 --> 00:10:31,753
Scott: he said hey sending questions, so I asked and Tom said You'll be able to buy it on iTunes Which is not subscribing to Apple TV right something anyone can do right?

167
00:10:31,773 --> 00:10:32,014
Scott: you know.

168
00:10:32,034 --> 00:10:40,500
Scott: without owning Apple devices you can just install iTunes for Windows on your Windows PC and buy it and get a video file that you can then play.

169
00:10:41,145 --> 00:10:42,819
Scott: So that's I guess it's superior option.

170
00:10:43,007 --> 00:10:50,790
Rym: Yep Cuz like I most things that I want to see I tend to just buy them on like Amazon And I just have this library that slowly building of things.

171
00:10:50,831 --> 00:10:51,554
Rym: I've bought sure.

172
00:10:51,835 --> 00:10:53,767
Scott: if you think about it though, right It's like okay.

173
00:10:53,807 --> 00:10:54,979
Scott: What am I gonna buy this movie?

174
00:10:54,979 --> 00:11:01,722
Rym: $15 right probably $20 who knows I mean $15 would be like the cost of one ticket to go see it at a story of Kaufman.

175
00:11:02,165 --> 00:11:02,749
Scott: that's true.

176
00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:04,178
Scott: That's very true.

177
00:11:05,943 --> 00:11:11,349
Rym: If I could go to the Astoria Kaufman theater today and see that movie I would pay the $15 like right now.

178
00:11:11,409 --> 00:11:11,851
Scott: You would.

179
00:11:12,233 --> 00:11:13,700
Scott: that's one way to look at it, right?

180
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:19,100
Scott: But another way to look at it is hey that Apple TV plus assuming you have an Apple device to use Apple TV.

181
00:11:19,421 --> 00:11:20,689
Rym: Oh, I see where you're going with this.

182
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,479
Scott: It's only five bucks a month.

183
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:37,131
Scott: Yeah, so just get it for three without even without even a free trial, so it's like huh, you know It's the same kind of deal where you know people always come at Adobe Creative Cloud and these other subscription services Right you know as being like in principle.

184
00:11:37,151 --> 00:11:37,673
Scott: They don't like it.

185
00:11:37,693 --> 00:11:39,400
Scott: They want to own stuff right.

186
00:11:39,802 --> 00:11:40,164
Scott: It's like.

187
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:43,100
Scott: I see where that principle comes from right.

188
00:11:43,964 --> 00:11:49,550
Scott: But it's like listen if they take something down, and it's not available anymore Yarr, yeah, that's pirate.

189
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:50,535
Scott: It's like pirate it.

190
00:11:50,575 --> 00:11:51,620
Scott: What's the big deal right?

191
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:51,961
Scott: It's like.

192
00:11:52,382 --> 00:11:53,165
Scott: you know it's nothing.

193
00:11:53,386 --> 00:11:55,694
Scott: you're not gonna lose anything in the age of the Internet.

194
00:11:55,735 --> 00:11:57,546
Scott: someone out there has got it for you right.

195
00:11:58,177 --> 00:12:10,460
Scott: and The subscriptions despite being in principle not owning stuff Economically are if you're gonna go as legal route are way way better than buying things right.

196
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,167
Scott: It's like pay five bucks a month.

197
00:12:12,187 --> 00:12:15,620
Scott: You can get Apple TV a free trial and then three months worth.

198
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:22,419
Scott: Well the caveat is if you feel like the cost of buying one movie You can see all that Apple TV plus Yep.

199
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:28,040
Rym: The caveat normally is that a lot of these things disappear from streaming services over time like I said.

200
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:29,859
Scott: But I said if that happens just pirate it.

201
00:12:30,221 --> 00:12:39,280
Rym: Because one thing I've noticed over time is that I watch a lot of stuff on Netflix But it's usually like shows that are coming out now or that are out recently that are current.

202
00:12:39,722 --> 00:12:50,800
Rym: But I don't think in like five years have I ever gone to Netflix and thought oh I would like to watch X movie type the name of that movie into the search and it was actually on Netflix to watch.

203
00:12:51,342 --> 00:12:51,724
Scott: Not once.

204
00:12:51,925 --> 00:12:53,734
Scott: oh yeah that almost never happens like it's.

205
00:12:53,935 --> 00:12:54,940
Rym: it's like literally.

206
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,919
Rym: It's been five years since I've typed the name of movie into Netflix, and it was actually on Netflix.

207
00:12:59,481 --> 00:13:04,495
Scott: No, no at this point in time the subscription services are for the.

208
00:13:04,675 --> 00:13:06,500
Scott: that's why they're making content, right?

209
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,580
Scott: They're basically TV channels.

210
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:13,520
Scott: They just happen to be the bat probably the best TV channels because they don't have commercials.

211
00:13:13,881 --> 00:13:16,690
Scott: And that's where the best content is these days right?

212
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:19,339
Scott: It's like what good contents on like NBC these days.

213
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:21,817
Scott: You know it's like.

214
00:13:21,878 --> 00:13:25,320
Rym: well You know there all the good is a bunch of good NBC stuff.

215
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:45,000
Scott: But I I acquired a lot of that on shall we say a boat I'm just saying But like the best you know fictional Video entertainment media these days is mostly being run on these subscription services the Disney pluses the Hulu's The Netflix's the whatever.

216
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,603
Scott: but honestly

217
00:13:45,623 --> 00:13:50,348
Rym: like one thing I know I've noticed looking at these services that I do pay for is that if I add up the Cost of all the

218
00:13:50,509 --> 00:13:51,316
Scott: HBO Max's

219
00:13:51,578 --> 00:13:59,052
Rym: yep I subscribe to a bunch of them and if I look at the cost of all of them combined It's still actually less than what basic cable would cost me.

220
00:13:59,835 --> 00:14:01,300
Scott: right and it's better than basic.

221
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,684
Scott: So it's like.

222
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:12,500
Scott: you know on the one hand you could be mad about these kind of situations, but on the other hand It's like actually if you just give up on your principle your life will actually just be better.

223
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,868
Scott: Yeah, cuz you'll save you'll save money and get more.

224
00:14:15,149 --> 00:14:17,277
Rym: in fact the pro way to go is to like stuff.

225
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,468
Scott: Just really care at everything.

226
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:20,413
Rym: I will buy things.

227
00:14:20,434 --> 00:14:21,480
Rym: I really like adventure time.

228
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,888
Rym: I bought them all because I like having this archive to like go because I'll watch that show again I'll show it to people.

229
00:14:26,434 --> 00:14:32,630
Rym: like in the old days We'd buy the DVD of an anime that we wanted to show to other people Regularly like cowboy bebop.

230
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:33,576
Rym: we kept showing to people.

231
00:14:33,596 --> 00:14:38,031
Rym: so we had the DVDs But most stuff that we like we didn't really need to watch again.

232
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,459
Rym: We didn't plan on watching it again, so we didn't need to own it.

233
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,016
Rym: But anyway like people who you rotate through like I'm gonna watch a bunch of Netflix stuff.

234
00:14:46,036 --> 00:14:48,218
Rym: you got Netflix for six months Then you cancel Netflix.

235
00:14:48,942 --> 00:14:54,236
Scott: Yeah point is this weekend go out and watch yourself some wolf walker walk.

236
00:14:54,256 --> 00:14:55,760
Scott: some will get it right.

237
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,269
Scott: You know the next GeekNights Wednesday is gonna be about that.

238
00:14:58,309 --> 00:15:02,482
Scott: move 100% I can tell you right now excited about this movie Right.

239
00:15:02,563 --> 00:15:06,098
Scott: so go and figure out some way that you're gonna be able to watch it.

240
00:15:07,022 --> 00:15:10,773
Rym: So in some other news this is not news like the thing I'm about to talk about.

241
00:15:10,914 --> 00:15:11,696
Rym: it is not new.

242
00:15:11,756 --> 00:15:12,840
Rym: we all knew this.

243
00:15:13,402 --> 00:15:16,875
Rym: This is more about some of the details of what it means.

244
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:18,743
Rym: you can read the article Why.

245
00:15:18,803 --> 00:15:27,702
Rym: it's the way it is and it's a problem that even though we know it's coming Especially people who listen to this podcast a lot of you are gonna be in this boat and a lot of you are younger than Us.

246
00:15:27,984 --> 00:15:29,495
Rym: so you're gonna even be in a worse boat.

247
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:40,278
Rym: possibly the argument that the articles about how it's Basically almost impossible for any millennial to actually retire at a reasonable age like there's just no way we did.

248
00:15:40,579 --> 00:15:40,980
Scott: we know that.

249
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:42,166
Scott: That's yeah, that's been.

250
00:15:42,266 --> 00:15:52,100
Rym: but it goes into a lot of the details of like what this means Why other generations could all retire how Millennials are like this like extra screwed for a bunch of weird reasons.

251
00:15:53,241 --> 00:15:54,284
Rym: It's very like.

252
00:15:54,726 --> 00:16:09,259
Rym: the details are odd in some ways because like tech workers are more likely to be able to retire than pretty much anyone Else in America who's a millennial, but that's because that sector is really hopping for reasons We talk about a lot on the show, but what I find interesting is that?

253
00:16:10,082 --> 00:16:13,454
Rym: Almost everyone who talks about this talks about like you did like oh.

254
00:16:13,574 --> 00:16:21,339
Rym: of course Millennials won't be able to retire But almost no one really actually tries to talk about what could we do about it like oh?

255
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:22,982
Rym: Do?

256
00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:24,930
Scott: there's a very easy thing to do about it.

257
00:16:25,412 --> 00:16:27,160
Scott: There's tons of things we can do about it.

258
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,005
Scott: That's that's no problem to solve at all.

259
00:16:29,387 --> 00:16:32,385
Scott: that the problem is not Figuring out those solutions.

260
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:37,040
Scott: the problem is making those solutions happen by getting power to implement those solutions.

261
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:51,860
Rym: Almost all things all these systemic problems in America are pretty much tied to the fact that the people who Actually want to solve these problems do not have power and you need to acquire power by playing a very difficult and complicated game.

262
00:16:52,501 --> 00:16:59,944
Scott: It the same you know same problem of everything right, but it's like yeah, we we know how to fix Social Security for Decades.

263
00:16:59,964 --> 00:17:04,017
Rym: yeah the post office like was fixed working fine till we broke it on purpose.

264
00:17:04,618 --> 00:17:05,642
Scott: right well We didn't break.

265
00:17:05,702 --> 00:17:06,042
Scott: what else?

266
00:17:06,123 --> 00:17:06,986
Scott: broke the royal?

267
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,148
Rym: we broke it on purpose.

268
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:13,261
Rym: sure the illegitimate president of the United States broke it on purpose More.

269
00:17:13,582 --> 00:17:15,933
Rym: yeah as as much as they.

270
00:17:15,953 --> 00:17:17,339
Rym: the crazy thing about the post office.

271
00:17:17,962 --> 00:17:29,954
Rym: They've been attacking the post office for 40 years to try to destroy it and despite all of that It was still working fine until our current president decided to just find by one definition of fine right is like.

272
00:17:29,994 --> 00:17:36,283
Scott: we saw you see other countries that have like Incredible post offices and ours was Maintaining right.

273
00:17:36,303 --> 00:17:37,787
Rym: well ours was doing in.

274
00:17:37,887 --> 00:17:47,984
Scott: ours was even when even when you know the evil people had less power The less evil people did not Transform the post office to make it ours Incredible like ours was.

275
00:17:48,105 --> 00:17:52,458
Rym: our maintain thing was still better than the domestic mail delivery in a lot of other industrialized countries.

276
00:17:52,478 --> 00:17:52,920
Rym: it actually was.

277
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,813
Scott: You know I've seen you know we were looking at.

278
00:17:56,054 --> 00:17:57,260
Scott: you keep talking about Australia.

279
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:01,340
Scott: We just didn't you know Australian post office already eight years ago, right?

280
00:18:01,801 --> 00:18:05,172
Scott: And that was better than any US post office if I've ever been in my whole life.

281
00:18:05,253 --> 00:18:09,799
Rym: however the thing we mailed didn't actually arrive so That's a different story.

282
00:18:10,542 --> 00:18:21,960
Rym: Saying I'd like to talk that up more to my poor hand Scott between you and me actually using the Australian post office We're batting 500 because I mailed something once from Australia, and it made it and we met.

283
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,585
Scott: I blame it.

284
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,742
Scott: I blame that more on my handwriting then Anything else,

285
00:18:26,324 --> 00:18:45,051
Rym: but I guess what I'm really the thing that bothers me about these retirement conversations though like point I want to make because I don't want to dwell on this I picked this because I didn't have better news and I mostly want to talk about parasite is that every conversation about retirement in America How do we get Millennials to retire?

286
00:18:45,111 --> 00:18:46,460
Rym: What do we do about old people who have money?

287
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:55,837
Rym: They all still assume that you should work until you're like 62 or 65 When I think we need to figure out a way to have people work less.

288
00:18:55,978 --> 00:19:03,980
Rym: overall The whole point of working should be that you can enjoy a lot of the time in your life with the benefits of your labor.

289
00:19:04,782 --> 00:19:08,945
Scott: Well, you know, I think there's just a clear divide and this you know It's it's somewhat of an.

290
00:19:09,085 --> 00:19:13,060
Scott: it goes along with correlates with the age divide in society.

291
00:19:13,522 --> 00:19:20,903
Scott: But I see plenty of people my age and even younger where you know their life is Their work right.

292
00:19:20,943 --> 00:19:21,927
Scott: their work is their thing.

293
00:19:22,207 --> 00:19:23,873
Rym: Oh, I'm in a weird place.

294
00:19:23,973 --> 00:19:30,285
Rym: Most people I work with their career is Like the majority of their life Right, and it's like.

295
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:35,060
Scott: so those people it's like they don't want to not work, right?

296
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:41,050
Scott: They may even you know enjoy working less hours Yeah, or they may enjoy having more vacation day.

297
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:46,500
Rym: if I have money to retire to a meager lifestyle today I would quit my job and retire immediately.

298
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:49,007
Scott: Right, right exactly, but they want like.

299
00:19:49,047 --> 00:19:53,820
Scott: their job is still like they're defining thing in their life, right?

300
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:57,008
Rym: And well, you can always tell when you meet people at a party You're like and someone's like.

301
00:19:57,048 --> 00:19:58,398
Rym: there's always someone's like, oh, what do you do?

302
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:02,854
Rym: Right when people ask me that I'm like, I'm a gamer in a podcaster, right?

303
00:20:02,874 --> 00:20:04,299
Scott: People ask me like, what do you do?

304
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:06,286
Scott: And I'm like too much.

305
00:20:06,507 --> 00:20:08,032
Scott: It's like yeah, it's you know, it's like.

306
00:20:08,353 --> 00:20:15,898
Scott: but most people you ask them What do you do regardless of age and they're gonna tell you their job unless they're unemployed and do something else.

307
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:16,440
Scott: Yep, right

308
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:38,679
Rym: So and I know that like the thing I want to point out in this article is it talks about and a lot of people Talking about retirement and Millennials are pointing out that Millennials can retire if they work longer which I think defeats the point of retirement entirely because hours you have when you're young are way more enjoyable than hours you have when you're old because things break down in our bodies.

309
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:51,528
Rym: like If I wait till I'm 80 to fly around the world, I'm not gonna be hiking a hundred miles through the Outback Most likely unless we get cyber bodies or something, but this article like I'm gonna read as passage here Working longer is a powerful lever.

310
00:20:51,909 --> 00:20:58,010
Rym: if Social Security benefits are claimed at 70 instead of at 62 Then you can retire like way better.

311
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,136
Scott: You got to make it to 70.

312
00:20:59,136 --> 00:21:04,092
Rym: Yeah How many people die before they can retire like you didn't a lot?

313
00:21:04,253 --> 00:21:06,580
Rym: Yeah, you didn't even get to use that money you saved.

314
00:21:08,482 --> 00:21:10,367
Rym: And this article even says quote.

315
00:21:10,567 --> 00:21:20,706
Rym: in fact my research so shows that the vast majority of Millennials will be fine If they work to age Although and this is the ridiculous part.

316
00:21:20,806 --> 00:21:22,190
Rym: Although that might sound old.

317
00:21:22,892 --> 00:21:24,477
Rym: It's historically normal.

318
00:21:24,578 --> 00:21:27,076
Rym: in another sense This is old person talking right here.

319
00:21:28,461 --> 00:21:35,720
Rym: Retiring at 70 leaves the ratio of retirement to working years the same as when Social Security was originally introduced.

320
00:21:36,601 --> 00:21:39,913
Rym: Talk about a terrible goalpost to base things on.

321
00:21:40,254 --> 00:21:43,869
Rym: Social Security came out of the Great Depression So old people wouldn't starve in the streets.

322
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,260
Rym: if that's the bar you're setting what the fuck?

323
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:48,943
Scott: The bars is not.

324
00:21:49,204 --> 00:21:51,151
Rym: the bar should be work for 10 years.

325
00:21:51,231 --> 00:21:53,017
Rym: robots do the rest like that's the goal.

326
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:53,459
Scott: That's right.

327
00:21:54,283 --> 00:21:55,007
Scott: The bar should be.

328
00:21:55,027 --> 00:21:56,254
Scott: no one has to work ever.

329
00:21:56,295 --> 00:21:57,139
Scott: robots do the rest.

330
00:21:59,063 --> 00:21:59,706
Rym: But look we bug.

331
00:21:59,726 --> 00:22:00,530
Rym: you see all those graphs.

332
00:22:00,772 --> 00:22:03,183
Rym: as we build robots we build robots We automate things.

333
00:22:03,244 --> 00:22:06,879
Rym: Scott and I our job is mostly to automate things like that's kind of in the end what we do.

334
00:22:07,321 --> 00:22:11,580
Rym: So machines will do it and the more we automate things the more profits come out and the more work gets done.

335
00:22:12,004 --> 00:22:13,639
Rym: But they don't let us work less hours.

336
00:22:14,642 --> 00:22:16,191
Scott: No, we've been talking about this forever.

337
00:22:16,272 --> 00:22:18,183
Rym: Yeah, cuz it's it's a primary It's a second.

338
00:22:18,445 --> 00:22:21,140
Rym: It's the second biggest concern in my life after defeating fascism.

339
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,990
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

340
00:22:26,392 --> 00:22:28,499
Rym: you call dibs on this so you get to talk about this.

341
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:31,680
Scott: Alright, this is the one of the best things of the day in a while.

342
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:35,111
Scott: I wouldn't say that if I if I wasn't super confident in it.

343
00:22:35,171 --> 00:22:38,080
Scott: so apparently right I learned something about ancient Rome.

344
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,630
Scott: I didn't know granted.

345
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:40,697
Scott: There's a lot about ancient Rome.

346
00:22:40,737 --> 00:22:53,768
Scott: I don't know God that's inside joke from like 20 more than 20 years ago, so apparently in ancient Rome they had these coins And not the coins you think of the Roman coins with.

347
00:22:53,808 --> 00:22:57,900
Scott: you know the Caesars head on one side right or both sides even right?

348
00:22:58,164 --> 00:23:13,616
Scott: but these coins On one side of them had a Roman numeral usually from between 1 and 16 in Roman numerals and on the other side of the coin was a elaborate and explicit depiction of a sexual act of some kind.

349
00:23:14,419 --> 00:23:17,088
Scott: and There are lots of these coins.

350
00:23:17,149 --> 00:23:20,520
Scott: if you do some Roman archaeology you will find these coins.

351
00:23:20,621 --> 00:23:21,245
Scott: No problem.

352
00:23:21,285 --> 00:23:26,189
Scott: if you go to a museum and you go to the Roman section They probably have a ton of these coins.

353
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:27,113
Scott: They're not rare.

354
00:23:27,314 --> 00:23:29,080
Scott: There's a lot of them right there.

355
00:23:29,401 --> 00:23:32,308
Scott: Anyone who's dug up Roman ruins has found these coins.

356
00:23:32,368 --> 00:23:34,493
Scott: probably they're all over the place.

357
00:23:34,534 --> 00:23:36,418
Scott: They're not a secret or anything.

358
00:23:36,478 --> 00:23:46,820
Scott: however in no like written record or Recorded record did Romans anywhere say what the hell these were for right?

359
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:51,134
Scott: It's like you read all the Roman writings, and you'll learn nothing about these coins.

360
00:23:51,575 --> 00:23:51,796
Scott: like.

361
00:23:51,936 --> 00:23:52,980
Scott: there's no talk of them.

362
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,919
Scott: There's no speak of them, but you find a ton of them.

363
00:23:56,981 --> 00:23:57,523
Scott: It's like man.

364
00:23:57,563 --> 00:24:00,893
Scott: We're finding these things everywhere, but we're not finding anyone saying what they were.

365
00:24:00,933 --> 00:24:03,079
Scott: so we don't know for sure.

366
00:24:03,902 --> 00:24:18,281
Scott: According to this Twitter person who definitely knows more about ancient Rome than I do Unless this is a fake thing like you know a Scottish military ration, but I don't That.

367
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:21,374
Scott: yeah, we don't know for sure what these are for.

368
00:24:21,776 --> 00:24:41,678
Scott: right, but Common sense right and basic educated logic would give you this one most likely conclusion which is the conclusion I also thought of before reading it which is that There was some sort of Roman law that said yeah, you cannot use you know a depiction of.

369
00:24:41,698 --> 00:24:49,620
Scott: you know The the Emperor right when you're paying for prostitution as an attempt to outlaw prostitution, right?

370
00:24:50,825 --> 00:25:05,413
Scott: and so and so They set up a system whereby you would exchange your Caesar coins for sexy coins by sex with sexy coins Right and then the prostitutes would turn their sexy coins back into.

371
00:25:05,433 --> 00:25:06,215
Scott: you know

372
00:25:06,656 --> 00:25:09,391
Rym: Caesar just described arcade tokens

373
00:25:09,934 --> 00:25:22,171
Scott: pretty much Right so there's a good chance that these are arcade tokens for brothels or Fake or their real thing or whatever regardless

374
00:25:22,291 --> 00:25:27,760
Rym: what they could make or weaver tokens like oh, I owe you a hand job I'll pay you a hand job and three blowjobs for that goat.

375
00:25:28,421 --> 00:25:30,975
Scott: Anyway, this is too good to not be thing of the day.

376
00:25:31,237 --> 00:25:35,207
Scott: check it out especially the awesome Pictures of coins with sexy act.

377
00:25:35,227 --> 00:25:39,562
Rym: what I appreciate about the coins the most is that the people in them just look like they're having fun Like there's.

378
00:25:39,582 --> 00:25:41,550
Scott: oh, yeah, no, they're they are great.

379
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:44,280
Scott: They and they are doing all kinds of different sexy acts.

380
00:25:44,381 --> 00:25:52,017
Scott: They're not doing the one where the guys like got the rope Yep, all kinds of good stuff going on in a sexy room.

381
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,388
Rym: Yeah This is good stuff.

382
00:25:54,872 --> 00:25:55,880
Rym: So my thing is really simple.

383
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:59,520
Rym: So many, you know, I play the trumpet and because of kovat, you know, I'm stuck home a lot.

384
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:04,980
Rym: So one of things I've been doing for a while I'm playing my trumpet again cuz I was a semi pro like I almost went to school for trumpet.

385
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,719
Rym: I almost had a very different life.

386
00:26:07,242 --> 00:26:14,600
Rym: I don't think I would be podcasting here and live in this life if I had actually pursued that But I was really good trumpet player, but I play a normal modern trumpet.

387
00:26:15,885 --> 00:26:19,100
Rym: if you don't know Trumpets and more all horns.

388
00:26:19,925 --> 00:26:29,069
Rym: those keys don't actually do a lot and 90% of the work to make a trumpet play a different note is all muscle and lips Like it's just it's.

389
00:26:29,291 --> 00:26:31,805
Rym: it's more like exercise It's like a physical skill.

390
00:26:31,825 --> 00:26:36,420
Rym: learning to play a trumpet is more about like learning to ski than it is about learning music.

391
00:26:37,446 --> 00:26:41,548
Rym: so Old trumpets don't have any valves at all.

392
00:26:41,729 --> 00:26:43,835
Rym: modern trumpets have valves because you can play more notes.

393
00:26:43,995 --> 00:26:48,808
Rym: old trumpets were played entirely With those muscles and you could only play notes.

394
00:26:48,848 --> 00:26:53,280
Rym: that were natural harmonics of however long the tube was of the trumpet you were holding.

395
00:26:55,121 --> 00:27:01,959
Rym: on consequence if you don't remember high school physics of resonance in tubes is that and the harmonics is that.

396
00:27:02,401 --> 00:27:06,332
Rym: Generally the higher pitch you have the more harmonics you have.

397
00:27:06,392 --> 00:27:11,469
Rym: so in a trumpet with no buttons You you don't have that many notes.

398
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:24,252
Rym: if you're playing low like if you play a note It'll be like a C. But then if you use your lips to go one note up You don't get to a D. It goes all the way up to a fucking G. You can't play any notes in between because those aren't harmonics of that tube.

399
00:27:24,634 --> 00:27:26,240
Rym: the valves change the length of the tube.

400
00:27:26,601 --> 00:27:30,360
Rym: So a valve modern trumpet is actually just a whole bunch of different trumpets.

401
00:27:30,702 --> 00:27:32,154
Rym: So you don't have to have 50 trouble 12 trumpets.

402
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:38,903
Rym: You just have one trumpet that you can turn your trumpet into whatever trumpet you need to make it easy to play a note at Any level.

403
00:27:39,669 --> 00:27:41,984
Rym: but if you get way high up Fingering's don't mean shit.

404
00:27:42,325 --> 00:27:46,400
Rym: You can play the same note with like five different fingerings and it's all in the lips.

405
00:27:46,902 --> 00:27:50,740
Rym: This is a video of someone playing a moderately difficult piece.

406
00:27:50,801 --> 00:28:00,940
Rym: I've actually played this piece before on a regular trumpet But it's someone playing a baroque trumpet that has no valves and you mean like the big long ones with the flag hanging off it.

407
00:28:01,124 --> 00:28:06,980
Rym: Yeah, but well So some of those actually have valves and they just look fancy because they're nice and loud and look cool in a renaissance fair.

408
00:28:07,161 --> 00:28:07,542
Rym: I've played.

409
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:08,043
Rym: I paid that.

410
00:28:08,083 --> 00:28:11,033
Rym: I played those for money in high school at a renaissance fair.

411
00:28:11,334 --> 00:28:11,976
Rym: They're real fun.

412
00:28:12,538 --> 00:28:13,260
Rym: or the long ones?

413
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,060
Rym: Yeah, they have the flag on it, but they're actually just a broke trumpet.

414
00:28:17,002 --> 00:28:22,420
Scott: Usually they're not as long as the ones you're thinking of But you know that you always see they're like cartoons and stuff, right?

415
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:27,880
Scott: It's like a whole whole - you're going that you're walking to a king and there's two lines of dudes all the way.

416
00:28:28,061 --> 00:28:29,108
Scott: Yep, those they're like.

417
00:28:29,148 --> 00:28:30,720
Scott: they're like trumpets on both sides.

418
00:28:30,761 --> 00:28:33,488
Rym: Yeah So this video is someone playing one of those.

419
00:28:33,849 --> 00:28:40,250
Rym: but I want you to watch it because it really shows how utterly Ridiculously physical playing a torn like this is.

420
00:28:40,551 --> 00:28:46,774
Rym: because it is very strenuous to play high notes And because it's already strenuous to play something like a tuba, right?

421
00:28:46,794 --> 00:28:48,220
Scott: It's like something old like that.

422
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:48,862
Scott: It's like damn.

423
00:28:48,962 --> 00:28:50,748
Rym: but to play a high note is really strenuous.

424
00:28:51,149 --> 00:28:57,620
Rym: and to make notes in a trumpet that doesn't have valves You have to play basically all high notes.

425
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:09,623
Rym: every note is a the equivalent of a modern very high note and this guy is fucking doing trills and like Really really fast melodies with no keys Faking it.

426
00:29:09,783 --> 00:29:12,174
Rym: No, that's that's just what it's like to play broke trumpet.

427
00:29:12,395 --> 00:29:13,440
Rym: They're hard as shit to play.

428
00:29:13,581 --> 00:29:13,883
Scott: He's just.

429
00:29:13,944 --> 00:29:14,791
Scott: he's just really good at.

430
00:29:14,851 --> 00:29:15,698
Rym: he's just really good at it.

431
00:29:15,981 --> 00:29:23,620
Rym: But if you watch you can kind of see that he's like he doesn't show it that much But you see him like sweating and exerting himself to play while he's just standing there.

432
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,364
Rym: Yeah, there's an aside.

433
00:29:27,545 --> 00:29:28,428
Rym: I hate broke trumpets.

434
00:29:28,649 --> 00:29:29,070
Rym: fuck them.

435
00:29:29,612 --> 00:29:31,920
Rym: I think technology has advanced for a reason.

436
00:29:35,445 --> 00:29:38,725
Rym: All right in the meta moment Stuck inside at some point.

437
00:29:38,745 --> 00:29:40,752
Rym: We'll read the tale of Genji PAX Unplugged.

438

442
00:29:54,021 --> 00:29:59,359

Scott: It packs online is gonna start Saturday the 12th and run all the way through the 20th.

460
00:30:32,981 --> 00:30:37,520
Rym: I've been not super jazzed about a lot of online cons just cuz they're like they don't feel like they're gonna do it for me.

461
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:43,397
Rym: But honestly after the crunchyroll Expo and then after hanging out in this discord a little bit and like seeing what people are saying.

462
00:30:43,417 --> 00:30:48,300
Rym: I Guess my hunger is so great for a con that it's almost doing it for me.

463
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:58,748
Scott: hmm, but yeah The the packs online is really trying as hard as anyone can try to really do the online con and replicate Packs as best as possible.

464
00:30:58,868 --> 00:31:03,988
Scott: Yeah, you know, it's still far from the mark, but you know They're trying so and it's gonna.

Scott: the content is technically 24/7 for nine days.

472
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:32,880
Scott: But at times for example, our panel is up against no other panels, right at least so far.

526
00:34:22,371 --> 00:34:23,235
Rym: Like we're gonna take questions.

527
00:34:23,255 --> 00:34:23,795
Rym: We have a question.

528
00:34:23,815 --> 00:34:24,438
Rym: We'll just answer it.

529
00:34:25,202 --> 00:34:26,570
Rym: Maybe I mean I will.

530
00:34:27,053 --> 00:34:28,018
Rym: you might not like my answer.

531
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:41,431
Rym: All right, oh and so, you know during that part like your audio was cutting out for me a little bit and then it fixed Itself, so I didn't hear everything you said.

532
00:34:42,339 --> 00:34:45,312
Scott: Oh Only on discord though only on discord like.

533
00:34:45,453 --> 00:34:46,699
Scott: obviously let me check the audition.

534
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:49,793
Rym: I assume your audition is fine because discord does go recording.

535
00:34:49,813 --> 00:34:51,040
Scott: Yeah, so I don't know.

536
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:55,679
Rym: It's probably fine because discord does cut out every now and then during the livestream, but it doesn't affect you.

537
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:56,989
Scott: You didn't cut out at all.

538
00:34:57,051 --> 00:34:58,522
Scott: So yeah All right.

539
00:34:58,542 --> 00:34:58,925
Scott: It seems like.

540
00:34:59,045 --> 00:34:59,649
Rym: it seems like it's all.

541
00:34:59,669 --> 00:35:00,655
Scott: keep this audition open.

542
00:35:00,676 --> 00:35:01,259
Scott: Keep my eye on it.

543
00:35:01,581 --> 00:35:02,344
Rym: It seems like it's fine.

544
00:35:03,047 --> 00:35:05,820
Rym: This is this has happened before and it's never shown up in the recording you have.

545
00:35:06,541 --> 00:35:07,105
Scott: Okay, seems good.

546
00:35:07,549 --> 00:35:07,992
Rym: All right.

547
00:35:08,092 --> 00:35:08,979
Rym: Let's jump right into this.

548
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:24,249
Rym: so we uh We I would say we became aware of Korean cinema in college when someone told us to watch a movie called attack the gas station.

549
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:31,595
Rym: Like up to that point like we watched a lot of Chinese kung-fu movies We watched a lot of Japanese live-action stuff But we didn't really watch.

550
00:35:31,635 --> 00:35:38,726
Rym: you know a lot about Korean films until we've watched Attack the gas station and we got weirdly obsessed with it because that film is a triumph.

551
00:35:39,408 --> 00:35:39,870
Scott: Yeah, it's weird.

552
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:45,046
Scott: It's like I'm interested in you know media from all sorts of countries.

553
00:35:45,086 --> 00:35:48,708
Scott: I don't care what country it is Right, and it's just that you know, it's like.

554
00:35:48,749 --> 00:35:54,446
Scott: well It seems weird to be always focusing on the Asian East Asian countries Korea, Japan China, right?

555
00:35:54,506 --> 00:35:55,810
Scott: Obviously, they're huge countries.

556
00:35:56,573 --> 00:35:58,179
Scott: You know culturally right it.

557
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:03,699
Scott: Korea is not huge South right, but You know, we're always like focusing on their media.

558
00:36:03,759 --> 00:36:03,919
Scott: right?

559
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:04,782
Scott: anime, right?

560
00:36:04,802 --> 00:36:07,610
Scott: We're not talking too much about you know, Russian animation.

561
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:12,740
Scott: There's very few we talk about right And part of it has to do with just how much media they create.

562
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,954
Scott: but really just how accessible the media different countries create Is to us right?

563
00:36:16,994 --> 00:36:23,377
Scott: It's like if suddenly I could access a whole bunch of Turkish media in English, right?

564
00:36:23,799 --> 00:36:25,203
Scott: I might be into that right?

565
00:36:25,323 --> 00:36:27,470
Scott: I just can't that they don't put it out, right?

566
00:36:29,091 --> 00:36:34,250
Scott: So, you know Korea or you since they were already watching a lot of Japanese Chinese things, right?

567
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:38,330
Scott: You know, I was thinking of Korean stuff because it's right there geographically speaking.

568
00:36:39,411 --> 00:36:45,470
Scott: And finally some of it became available right, you know, we were starting to see things like Korean DDR, right?

569
00:36:46,554 --> 00:36:48,109
Scott: And then eventually kpop became a thing.

570
00:36:50,173 --> 00:36:53,030
Scott: But yeah, so it's like we've been watching Korean movies for a while.

571
00:36:54,351 --> 00:37:03,518
Scott: And then you know this guy you may have heard of him bong joon-ho comes on the scene and he directs quite a few Significant movies over the course of.

572
00:37:03,558 --> 00:37:07,270
Scott: you know, since you know, the 2000s right you had the snowpiercer, right?

573
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:08,058
Scott: Which everyone knows.

574
00:37:08,078 --> 00:37:09,230
Scott: yeah was a big deal.

575
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,554
Rym: I love that that movie is.

576
00:37:10,574 --> 00:37:14,869
Rym: I think that movie is brilliant and I love it and I love how weird and dumb it is.

577
00:37:15,592 --> 00:37:23,025
Scott: Yeah, you have oak jaw, which is uh, I don't know how many people know or have seen that movie but You know, maybe you should.

578
00:37:23,046 --> 00:37:25,407
Scott: yeah It was kind of a big deal.

579
00:37:26,993 --> 00:37:28,850
Scott: But yeah, so parasite came out.

580
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:39,627
Scott: So I went to see parasite in the theater with a friend like the tiny IFC theater because you know There was a lot of excitement going on about this movie, you know before it won the Oscar for Best Picture.

581
00:37:39,647 --> 00:37:44,661
Scott: Hey, yeah And then it did win the Oscar for Best Picture deservedly.

582
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:50,158
Rym: so yeah, like I saw all these accolades I saw everyone talking about it But somehow I avoided knowing I'd like.

583
00:37:50,179 --> 00:37:53,230
Rym: I pointedly tried to not know what it was about because I wanted to just go see it.

584
00:37:53,250 --> 00:38:00,060
Rym: I lately doing this a lot with movies where if I can avoid seeing even a trailer I like to go into movies completely blind.

585
00:38:00,643 --> 00:38:01,547
Scott: I don't believe in spoilers.

586
00:38:01,567 --> 00:38:02,170
Scott: Tell me everything.

587
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:05,562
Scott: Anyway, the point is I went to see this movie.

588
00:38:05,662 --> 00:38:11,570
Scott: Well, and then Rick I was like Rick because see this movie Yeah, even before it was literally officially the best movie.

589
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:13,359
Rym: Yeah, and you were you were like you wouldn't best move.

590
00:38:13,741 --> 00:38:15,350
Rym: You wouldn't tell me anything about it.

591
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:16,514
Rym: All you said you just go.

592
00:38:16,534 --> 00:38:17,437
Rym: What are you there?

593
00:38:17,457 --> 00:38:19,383
Rym: So like what's in the basement?

594
00:38:19,865 --> 00:38:23,392
Scott: And then I mean because at the one No, I don't care about Right.

595
00:38:23,693 --> 00:38:25,581
Scott: Well, I don't care about being spoiled.

596
00:38:25,621 --> 00:38:27,610
Scott: I'm not gonna guess be a jerk and spoil people.

597
00:38:27,971 --> 00:38:28,654
Scott: They don't wanna.

598
00:38:28,875 --> 00:38:32,830
Rym: but you know, I gotta say well, we won't spoil anything until we'll warn you.

599
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:41,224
Rym: we're gonna talk about this movie in a little more depth with spoilers after a point, but I Did not know like where this movie was gonna go and it started.

600
00:38:41,405 --> 00:38:41,947
Rym: I followed it.

601
00:38:42,027 --> 00:38:44,056
Rym: I saw what was going on like okay, I see where the movies going.

602
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:50,843
Rym: and then the thing happened and The movie changed radically and I was there.

603
00:38:50,863 --> 00:38:52,009
Rym: then the movie was great.

604
00:38:53,071 --> 00:38:56,863
Rym: And then anyway, but there's a big moment where the movie changes.

605
00:38:57,465 --> 00:38:58,548
Scott: if you haven't seen this movie.

606
00:38:58,749 --> 00:39:00,179
Scott: Come on What do you what are you waiting for?

607
00:39:00,199 --> 00:39:07,332
Scott: Right go and see it right now You can go online and I think if you keep it's not at any streaming service where you live You could.

608
00:39:07,372 --> 00:39:13,284
Scott: there's definitely like a legal way for you to just pay a flat rate Like I think I got an Amazon Prime video.

609
00:39:13,345 --> 00:39:16,868
Scott: I paid money Yeah, and they gave me I could just watch the movie as many times I want.

610
00:39:16,908 --> 00:39:20,064
Scott: now You can obviously get a DVD or Blu-ray.

611
00:39:20,265 --> 00:39:20,929
Scott: You could pirate it.

612
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:22,435
Scott: There's a very easy movie to watch.

613
00:39:22,837 --> 00:39:26,210
Scott: go watch it immediately like stop listening to this right now and go watch it.

614
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:29,205
Scott: Yep, what you know, but I guess what anyway is the like.

615
00:39:29,366 --> 00:39:30,612
Rym: the acting is good The.

616
00:39:30,752 --> 00:39:37,756
Rym: the cinematography is just beautiful like the movie is funny, but also dark It is tragic.

617
00:39:37,997 --> 00:39:42,090
Rym: It is violent, but it is also heartwarming in some aspects.

618
00:39:42,251 --> 00:39:44,944
Rym: There's a lot going on in this movie like most good movies.

619
00:39:44,984 --> 00:39:46,070
Scott: It's got a little everything.

620
00:39:46,171 --> 00:39:50,010
Scott: It's not one of those, you know, sort of like just a comedy just a whatever kind of move.

621
00:39:50,052 --> 00:39:50,854
Rym: Yeah It's not just.

622
00:39:50,894 --> 00:39:53,570
Rym: John Wick shoots people in the head for an hour and a half, which I love.

623
00:39:53,952 --> 00:39:57,689
Rym: But that is not what I would consider the mark of a great movie for all time.

624
00:39:59,284 --> 00:40:01,820
Scott: No, so The name parasite right?

625
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:10,769
Scott: It's called parasite because you know I mean it's about the sort of parasitic relationships people have in a capitalist society, right where it's like.

626
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:13,579
Scott: You know you need money to live right?

627
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:14,422
Scott: Well, where do you get money?

628
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:16,629
Scott: from someone else who has money, right?

629
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:21,830
Scott: So you need your sort of become much like a parasite on that person, right?

630
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:32,770
Scott: you have to you know latch on to them right, you know, whether it's your employer or You're a criminal and you're stealing from someone right, you know, there's capitalism.

631
00:40:33,212 --> 00:40:36,604
Scott: You know people's relationships are all sort of parasitic in nature.

632
00:40:36,624 --> 00:40:44,585
Scott: You're sucking at the metaphorical teat of something Right, it could be a government teat or who knows what right - right.

633
00:40:44,826 --> 00:40:52,650
Scott: and so in this movie They're telling the story of a of a family of four right a mother father a daughter and a son.

634
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:54,697
Scott: The daughter and the son are like older.

635
00:40:54,777 --> 00:40:55,258
Scott: They're not.

636
00:40:55,278 --> 00:40:58,690
Scott: they're like, you know early 20s late teens sort of college.

637
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:00,089
Rym: Yeah, like college age.

638
00:41:00,977 --> 00:41:02,490
Scott: Yes, Lee on college-age kids.

639
00:41:03,592 --> 00:41:05,738
Scott: And this family is poor unemployed.

640
00:41:05,979 --> 00:41:07,203
Scott: They live in like a basement.

641
00:41:07,303 --> 00:41:07,745
Scott: It sucks.

642
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:09,390
Scott: Yeah, right and they are.

643
00:41:09,671 --> 00:41:15,390
Rym: They're like lower middle class or like, you know upper lower middle class like they're that step below the Simpsons.

644
00:41:17,032 --> 00:41:17,555
Scott: Yeah, they're.

645
00:41:17,676 --> 00:41:20,049
Scott: they're not doing well, but they're not homeless, right?

646
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:24,465
Scott: It's like they have food, but it's it's not great, right?

647
00:41:24,827 --> 00:41:29,600
Scott: So This family obviously is a is a is a parasitic.

648
00:41:29,641 --> 00:41:30,443

00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:39,370
Scott: They're parasites on society and sort of like in order to live right there sort of like they live sort of like cockroaches, right?

652
00:41:44,653 --> 00:41:49,270

653
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:50,677
Scott: Yeah, right.

654
00:41:50,878 --> 00:41:52,586
Rym: and the movie like it does not.

655
00:41:52,666 --> 00:41:55,137
Rym: it's not denigrating Like the movie really shows like they got their hustle.

656
00:41:55,177 --> 00:41:56,061
Rym: Everyone's got their hustle.

657
00:41:56,101 --> 00:41:56,803
Rym: Don't begrudge someone.

658
00:41:56,824 --> 00:41:57,265
Scott: They're hustle.

659
00:41:57,285 --> 00:41:58,410
Scott: They're hustling, right?

660
00:41:59,252 --> 00:42:00,090
Rym: They're not survive.

661
00:42:00,931 --> 00:42:01,553
Scott: Right, exactly.

662
00:42:01,995 --> 00:42:05,529
Scott: So what happens is they eventually find a hustle.

663
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:09,422
Scott: One of the son's friend, you know is tutoring this.

664
00:42:09,663 --> 00:42:10,787
Rym: Oh, yeah tutoring.

665
00:42:10,807 --> 00:42:11,510
Rym: He had his own hustle.

666
00:42:12,371 --> 00:42:17,295
Scott: Yeah, he had his own hustle, but the son's friend is not poor right like they are And he has to leave.

667
00:42:17,315 --> 00:42:25,322
Scott: he's gonna leave to study abroad and he is tutoring this high school girl And he's like, hey, you know, you're my friend.

668
00:42:25,342 --> 00:42:27,470
Scott: I want you to tutor this high school girl.

669
00:42:27,751 --> 00:42:31,744
Scott: Now I'm gonna refer you to get this job right tutoring to make some money.

670
00:42:32,105 --> 00:42:32,988
Scott: because I trust you, right?

671
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:51,670
Scott: I don't trust my other college friends Right But anyway, so he goes and gets this job with the referral from his friend, right and he's sort of you know His parasitic way scams his way in there and the family of the daughter that he's tutoring is very wealthy.

672
00:42:51,851 --> 00:42:57,310
Scott: They live in this fancy house made by a famous architect, right and the house itself becomes a character in the movie.

673
00:42:57,714 --> 00:43:06,717
Scott: but the rest of the movie is now about this parasitic relationship of the wealthy family and The poor family.

674
00:43:06,777 --> 00:43:09,410
Rym: like the poor family finally finds the perfect hustle.

675
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:11,775
Rym: Yeah, and they execute it.

676
00:43:11,996 --> 00:43:14,986
Rym: they execute this hustle and then what happens after that?

677
00:43:15,347 --> 00:43:16,010
Rym: it is a movie.

678
00:43:16,815 --> 00:43:18,749
Rym: Yeah, the one thing I would say like that.

679
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:27,310
Rym: I think the fundamental question without talking about spoilers about this movie like the question to ask yourself as you watch Who is the parasite?

680
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:29,969
Rym: What is a parasite like for real?

681
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:34,450
Rym: It's hard to really talk about this movie unless you've seen it right now.

682
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:43,370
Scott: That's that's the number one thing I like about the movie is how there it's not a. you know The director himself said yeah that the real bad guy is capitalism, right?

683
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:53,775
Scott: Is that during different points of the movie your opinions on different characters how they're behaving goes Every which way right?

684
00:43:53,836 --> 00:43:57,348
Scott: someone who looks someone who looks good is like at one point.

685
00:43:57,449 --> 00:44:02,424
Scott: It's like It's like oh look, you know, I'm really sympathetic with this person right?

686
00:44:02,644 --> 00:44:06,410
Scott: and the next second they're doing something They do something that's heinous, right?

687
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:13,230
Scott: You're like that awful person and it's like it's flips back and forth on all the people like sometimes scene to scene.

688
00:44:13,611 --> 00:44:16,990
Scott: You know, there's also a gradual shift throughout the movie, right?

689
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:25,070
Scott: And it's like you see people doing bad actions that are on their own heinous But you can understand why they're doing them.

690
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:26,355
Scott: So maybe you're on their side.

691
00:44:26,616 --> 00:44:44,171
Scott: you see someone doing something like nice and noble But you see why they're doing it and now you're against them, right and all these, you know It keeps flipping and flopping all over right and it's like no one in the movie is A hundred percent clearly good bad Like.

692
00:44:44,352 --> 00:44:48,907
Scott: it's not about this direct conflict of these are the good guys the main characters.

693
00:44:48,947 --> 00:44:49,730
Scott: These are the bad guys.

694
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:52,444
Scott: It's these are the people are gonna focus on more.

695
00:44:52,464 --> 00:44:53,510
Scott: so the main characters.

696
00:44:53,992 --> 00:44:58,609
Scott: but we're it's this intertwining relationships here between all the characters.

697
00:44:58,629 --> 00:45:06,393
Scott: and To demonstrate to you that yeah, all you know, people are forced to do they're trying to be good Maybe they're not.

698
00:45:06,894 --> 00:45:13,653
Scott: but all these things that people are forced to do and the situations they're in are because of Society, right?

699
00:45:13,793 --> 00:45:17,764
Scott: It's sort of created this scenario of awfulness for everybody.

700
00:45:18,045 --> 00:45:21,452
Scott: Yeah, watch it explode Fashion.

701
00:45:21,894 --> 00:45:24,769
Rym: Yeah, I can't just like we're gonna spoil after this.

702
00:45:25,131 --> 00:45:28,683
Rym: So if you haven't seen this movie go watch it like 100%.

703
00:45:28,683 --> 00:45:30,470
Rym: This is one of the great movies of all time.

704
00:45:31,012 --> 00:45:32,620
Scott: So I don't know about that.

705
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:33,183
Scott: It's up there.

706
00:45:33,384 --> 00:45:34,730
Rym: I think about all the sudden all time.

707
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:37,524
Rym: I think this movie will be remembered like decades from now.

708
00:45:37,604 --> 00:45:38,690
Rym: It'll still be spoken of in.

709
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:39,552
Rym: Oh, yeah, this will.

710
00:45:39,933 --> 00:45:47,576
Scott: this will be a movie that sticks around that people like in 20 years where it's like, you know Movies you should see right the same way.

711
00:45:47,797 --> 00:45:51,810
Scott: That's like, you know, we're still watching seven samurai, you know, it's like, all right.

712
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:54,381
Scott: Well 30 years from now people still be watching parasite for sure.

713
00:45:54,682 --> 00:45:59,829
Scott: Yeah, so some other non Spoilery things about the movie, right?

714
00:46:01,273 --> 00:46:07,730
Scott: There I watched some behind the scenes Ooh, I didn't watch that And some commentary stuff on YouTube.

715
00:46:07,971 --> 00:46:26,198
Scott: so I highly recommend doing that after you see it and some of it was really fascinating about like how some of the thing I Remember most is they talked about the set where the poor family lives and how it's this street and they live at the end of the street and like a sub basement and They're like, they're like, yeah everything on this street.

716
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:31,488
Scott: We built up to that point and everything beyond that is CG All right.

717
00:46:32,653 --> 00:46:34,570
Scott: And that I found was really fascinating.

718
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:37,930
Scott: I'm pretty sure the house the movie takes place in is a real house.

719
00:46:38,111 --> 00:46:42,789
Scott: You could go to it if you wanted to but it's sort of you know, I guess it's not a very accessible place.

720
00:46:43,191 --> 00:46:46,561
Scott: It's like up on it up on a hill and fenced off from the world, right?

721
00:46:46,601 --> 00:46:48,868
Scott: It's because it's a fancy mansion type place.

722
00:46:48,928 --> 00:46:52,808
Scott: Yeah There's really fascinating stuff to see there.

723
00:46:54,012 --> 00:46:55,541
Scott: The other thing is so in the movie.

724
00:46:55,884 --> 00:47:00,619
Scott: There's sort of this Sort of certain things that happen over and over again.

725
00:47:00,699 --> 00:47:04,408
Scott: the son who I guess is the mainest main character maybe right?

726
00:47:04,849 --> 00:47:11,487
Rym: Yeah I mean he he's the character who basically initiates the movie and also ends the movie.

727
00:47:11,768 --> 00:47:22,409
Rym: Yes so and he has that and we should probably explain like You could you might want to look up what that Rocky is carrying around is because if you're especially if you're an American you might Have be familiar with this concept.

728
00:47:24,054 --> 00:47:33,805
Scott: yeah, it's sort of like These stones that I don't fully understand the deal myself But like, you know, there's sort of like a thing like people have a hobby collected them.

729
00:47:33,865 --> 00:47:38,369
Scott: There's sort of like philosopher Philosophy stones or something Rym's googling it right now.

730
00:47:39,072 --> 00:47:51,190
Rym: So I googled it because I was vaguely familiar with it like you and I googled it after we watched the movie to see Seen them on display in some people's houses occasionally and I've seen people have lots of them before.

731
00:47:51,611 --> 00:47:56,550
Rym: I've seen him like professors at RIT would have like like I'd seen like sitting on a shelf in their office.

732
00:47:57,213 --> 00:47:57,716
Scott: Yeah, they're

733
00:47:57,736 --> 00:48:03,753
Rym: basically just rocks to contemplate aesthetically Like

734
00:48:03,793 --> 00:48:07,350
Scott: sort of like a bonsai tree, but it's a rock but you don't do anything to it cuz it's just a rock

735
00:48:07,612 --> 00:48:08,216
Rym: yeah, whereas

736
00:48:08,256 --> 00:48:09,868
Scott: you have to care for a bonsai tree and

737
00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:16,846
Rym: There's like higher but there's like higher quality ones and lower quality ones and like people who I'm

738
00:48:16,906 --> 00:48:17,649
Scott: sure there are care

739
00:48:17,689 --> 00:48:18,110
Rym: about them.

740
00:48:18,231 --> 00:48:19,610
Rym: Like think about all these different attributes.

741
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:32,421
Scott: Anyway early on in the movie right that college friend who's only in for one scene gives that rock to The family is like a gift which I thought was fascinating because you see this whole scene Like it's not really spoilers where this family is desperately poor.

742
00:48:32,923 --> 00:48:41,590
Rym: and then their friend who's way better off Like the guy the kids friend gives him a gift that if you're that poor is absolutely worthless and at best is just a burden.

743
00:48:42,072 --> 00:48:44,500
Rym: but yet he thinks it's a good gift to give.

744
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:56,735
Rym: like the movie like that sort of sets the tone for the movie of Hey, here's a gift that does not help you in any way Mm-hmm, but also, you know, the Sun says oh, it's so metaphorical right.

745
00:48:56,936 --> 00:49:01,029
Scott: and then he repeats that line several times throughout the movie.

746
00:49:01,049 --> 00:49:10,330
Scott: and Whenever the rock reappears in the movie, right it even if he doesn't say it It's like the rock is always doing something metaphorical.

747
00:49:12,052 --> 00:49:12,475
Scott: It's weird.

748
00:49:13,178 --> 00:49:15,208
Scott: It's weird how it's not weird.

749
00:49:15,329 --> 00:49:23,650
Scott: It's The movie is Simultaneously full of metaphor and allegory but is not subtle, right?

750
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:39,938
Scott: It's sort of like it without it doesn't you know, it always shows rather than tell which is good But it shows in such an obvious beat you over the head showing way that you couldn't no one could miss it Which I mean snowpiercer was very similar.

751
00:49:39,978 --> 00:49:41,765
Rym: I mean you've seen snowpiercer.

752
00:49:41,826 --> 00:49:45,419
Rym: The movie is just oh Those are the people in steerage.

753
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:46,925
Rym: These are the people in coach.

754
00:49:47,045 --> 00:49:48,410
Rym: Those are the first-class people.

755
00:49:48,591 --> 00:49:51,090
Rym: This is a metaphor for society, right?

756
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:52,817
Scott: I think about the end of the Godfather.

757
00:49:52,937 --> 00:49:55,186
Scott: spoilers right the end of the Godfather.

758
00:49:55,227 --> 00:49:58,417
Scott: the first one Is a is is two different scenes.

759
00:49:58,477 --> 00:50:13,597
Scott: right in one scene all these hitmen are going out and killing every other mafia boss Except the Godfather and in the other scene the Godfather is in church Right becoming the Godfather of like his I guess nephew or something niece or nephew.

760
00:50:13,658 --> 00:50:14,781
Scott: I don't remember right.

761
00:50:15,183 --> 00:50:18,575
Scott: and there the priest is like, you know Satan Do you renounce him?

762
00:50:18,675 --> 00:50:23,810
Scott: and he's like yeah, I renounce Satan and then it shows his own hit man Like shooting a dude right in the eye, right?

763
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:28,325
Scott: It cuts between back and forth that kind of allegory that is not subtle.

764
00:50:28,766 --> 00:50:29,810
Scott: is this whole movie?

765
00:50:30,031 --> 00:50:36,254
Rym: Yep, right this movie like it it escalates quickly like ever as soon as you think okay See where this movie is going.

766
00:50:36,595 --> 00:50:40,990
Rym: It will just escalate and escalate and escalate and escalate and then it's and it just ends, right?

767
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:44,902
Scott: And it's like every time you think that it's like, okay I see where this is going.

768
00:50:44,983 --> 00:50:48,270
Scott: step one We go up the stairs to step two go up the stairs to step three.

769
00:50:48,711 --> 00:50:51,561
Scott: It takes it up two more levels to wherever you think it's gonna be.

770
00:50:51,581 --> 00:50:52,243
Scott: Yep, right.

771
00:50:52,504 --> 00:50:54,150
Rym: Oh, it's raining outside.

772
00:50:54,634 --> 00:50:55,481
Rym: Oh rains a platform.

773
00:50:55,642 --> 00:50:55,965
Rym: Oh, right.

774
00:50:56,247 --> 00:51:00,070
Scott: Oh Right, and they managed to bring back right.

775
00:51:01,025 --> 00:51:08,449
Scott: You know Common thing in comedy sketches and movies right is like you introduce the thing Chekhov's gun and it comes back again later.

776
00:51:09,072 --> 00:51:10,909
Rym: Right Chekhov's scholar stone.

777
00:51:11,711 --> 00:51:15,783
Scott: Chekhov scholar stone right but also it's like so the scholar stone.

778
00:51:15,944 --> 00:51:19,509
Scott: when you see it at the beginning of the movie You're like that's Chekhov's gun.

779
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:23,866
Scott: Yeah, I see that is I could tell right away the shot like guns in on it a couple times.

780
00:51:23,886 --> 00:51:24,790
Rym: the kids like carrying it.

781
00:51:24,931 --> 00:51:26,377
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

782
00:51:26,879 --> 00:51:27,964
Scott: and and it fires.

783
00:51:28,104 --> 00:51:28,908
Scott: they fire that gun.

784
00:51:28,928 --> 00:51:32,437
Scott: Trust me But it does a good job.

785
00:51:32,718 --> 00:51:35,910
Scott: and that there are many other Chekhov's guns in the movie.

786
00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:40,182
Scott: There's like a whole Chekhov's Arsenal right and the whole Chekhov's Arsenal.

787
00:51:40,282 --> 00:51:42,428
Scott: It all gets fired every gun fires.

788
00:51:42,448 --> 00:51:44,775
Scott: There's no There's no gun.

789
00:51:44,795 --> 00:51:46,179
Scott: We're like they didn't fire that one.

790
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:48,988
Scott: It's like no they fire all the guns several times even.

791
00:51:49,329 --> 00:51:55,910
Scott: but Some of those guns that are fired you did not recognize as guns when they first appeared.

792
00:51:56,090 --> 00:52:05,378
Scott: But when they first appeared they appeared so prominently that when they do fire you remember Very clearly.

793
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:07,050
Scott: Oh, that was a Chekhov's gun.

794
00:52:07,211 --> 00:52:11,517
Scott: It was so prominent when I first saw it spoil But I didn't know it was a gun when I first saw.

795
00:52:11,537 --> 00:52:15,229
Rym: the one that was the starkest was the automatic lights in the house.

796
00:52:16,292 --> 00:52:24,306
Scott: Oh, yeah, that was that's the least obvious one because when it when that gun fires I was just like motherfucker and that gun fires two or three times.

797
00:52:24,346 --> 00:52:25,270
Rym: Yeah, it just keeps firing.

798
00:52:25,431 --> 00:52:26,662
Rym: It's like a semi-auto in there.

799
00:52:27,348 --> 00:52:33,110
Rym: Yep Alright super spoilers cuz I actually want to talk about like what this movie is about like for real.

800
00:52:33,532 --> 00:52:36,169
Scott: But now you know what kind of movie it is, you know, what kind of feel it has.

801
00:52:36,812 --> 00:52:44,549
Scott: Right, so, you know if you want to watch if you're still thinking about not watching it now, you know if you're super pro Capitalism you might get mad at this movie.

802
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:50,099
Rym: This movie is basically saying you are a bad person and it's not wrong.

803
00:52:50,741 --> 00:52:51,462
Scott: No, it's not wrong.

804
00:52:52,144 --> 00:52:54,048
Rym: Alright spoilers spoilers spoilers.

805
00:52:55,050 --> 00:53:11,654
Rym: I Think the scene that hit me the hardest was the dad just saying don't make plans like that scene when they're in the shelter after the flood like that whole scene of them just walking through the rain and like everything's in misery and like if it's almost feels Like an apocalypse is happening.

806
00:53:12,216 --> 00:53:15,384
Rym: and he's just like don't make plans like that's the secret.

807
00:53:16,307 --> 00:53:22,848
Rym: and then like the next day Just happens like the apocalypse fades out and then the climax of the movie fades in.

808
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:27,049
Rym: basically That was the scene that got me the most.

809
00:53:29,545 --> 00:53:36,412
Scott: hmm, I think the scene that I think in this is the the most Like.

810
00:53:36,452 --> 00:53:41,250
Scott: it's most memorable for me is when they're all hiding under the table, right?

811
00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:43,454
Rym: That was both funny and a little scary.

812
00:53:43,474 --> 00:53:44,475
Scott: I like right.

813
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:44,956
Scott: It's like.

814
00:53:45,357 --> 00:53:48,982
Scott: it's like because that scene goes on Law.

815
00:53:49,042 --> 00:53:49,263
Scott: it's not.

816
00:53:49,283 --> 00:53:51,329
Scott: it's not too long but it's way goes on.

817
00:53:51,649 --> 00:53:59,235
Scott: they're under that table for an uncomfortably long amount of time Hiding right and trying to get out of there in a way, right?

818
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:10,340
Rym: And it's like without getting caught but also like whole time that seems going on long But the head injury like you're still thinking about that like that right gone away.

819
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,700
Rym: That's like resolved and the camera doesn't come back to it.

820
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:27,820
Scott: There is so much stuff going on at that time and it's like, you know You have scenes in movies where things get tense and they get more tense and they get more tense And usually there'll be some sort of you know relief right like, you know horror movie.

821
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:36,360
Scott: It's like the aliens come and the aliens come and someone dies you get away and now you're chilling and waiting for the tension to build Away does not solve any of their problems.

822
00:54:36,801 --> 00:54:37,945
Scott: No, it's like here.

823
00:54:37,965 --> 00:54:47,585
Scott: you just have the tension builds and they manage to find new ways and ways you didn't see coming to have it continue building and Twisting and turning.

824
00:54:47,645 --> 00:54:51,194
Scott: it's like the screw just keeps getting tighter throughout the whole scene.

825
00:54:51,595 --> 00:54:53,620
Scott: Oh now the family's coming home.

826
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:57,152
Scott: Yeah, now they're fighting over that while they're fighting over the cell phone.

827
00:54:57,433 --> 00:54:58,075
Scott: then it's like.

828
00:54:58,537 --> 00:55:01,599
Scott: it's like, you know It's like stuff just keeps happening.

829
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:10,364
Scott: They just keep throwing every time, you know, the current tension is about to become sort of dull and you know Okay, this is gonna.

830
00:55:10,605 --> 00:55:15,120
Scott: they twist it again with a new a new thing to make that scene go harder.

831
00:55:15,201 --> 00:55:16,659
Scott: I think that scene actually makes up.

832
00:55:16,741 --> 00:55:27,240
Rym: I don't know time wise but it feels like it makes up like the bulk of the movie in a way because that's where like that whole scene not like Not up until they're hiding but like the head injury and the fight in the basement.

833
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:34,607
Rym: All of that is where it like they were like you could make the argument originally like alright There's this rich family this family.

834
00:55:34,647 --> 00:55:34,747
Rym: Now.

835
00:55:34,788 --> 00:55:36,273
Rym: There are parasites of the rich family.

836
00:55:36,354 --> 00:55:38,040
Rym: Obviously, that's the facile allegory.

837
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:39,399
Rym: That's not what the right was going for.

838
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,086
Scott: It's like that part of the movie where they're.

839
00:55:41,226 --> 00:55:55,365
Scott: you know in getting into the the rich house right takes up You know quite a bit of time Right, but then it's like that scene sort of like when they're all in the when the the rich family goes to camping Right and then the

840
00:55:55,445 --> 00:55:57,813
Rym: old caretaker like comes back and knocks out the poor

841
00:55:57,853 --> 00:55:58,255
Scott: family.

842
00:55:58,455 --> 00:55:59,820
Scott: poor family's chillin in the house.

843
00:56:00,021 --> 00:56:03,279
Scott: That is the moment where it takes you into like the next act.

844
00:56:03,501 --> 00:56:04,768
Rym: That's also the heights like.

845
00:56:04,808 --> 00:56:06,840
Rym: that is the height that family has ever achieved.

846
00:56:07,222 --> 00:56:10,660
Rym: That is like the best night they have ever had in their lives, right?

847
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:14,073
Scott: And then the doorbell rings right exactly the doorbell rings.

848
00:56:14,354 --> 00:56:15,980
Scott: things get completely off the rails.

849
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:21,960
Scott: They keep going off the rails like that whole night, you know in movie time, right?

850
00:56:22,161 --> 00:56:26,659
Rym: But then that's like we're like it fades back in the next day and it's like the Sun is out.

851
00:56:27,101 --> 00:56:28,545
Rym: Everything's quote normal.

852
00:56:28,886 --> 00:56:31,835
Rym: everyone like acts like everything's fine and goes about.

853
00:56:31,875 --> 00:56:33,640
Scott: their business depends who right?

854
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,800
Scott: It's like they go home in the flood, right?

855
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,589
Rym: But it's like I meant to wake up like after the flood.

856
00:56:38,629 --> 00:56:47,104
Rym: when they go quote go to work in where they're fighting for clothing Yeah but that long scene like I when There.

857
00:56:47,124 --> 00:56:49,800
Rym: so they're the parasite of the rich family facile allegory, whatever.

858
00:56:50,141 --> 00:57:02,553
Rym: But then when they encounter people who are they are lower class than them who are more in more desperate states than them They start getting moral like we deserve to be where we are.

859
00:57:02,793 --> 00:57:04,999
Rym: you you parasite get out, right?

860
00:57:07,744 --> 00:57:08,913
Rym: Exactly what you're doing.

861
00:57:08,954 --> 00:57:11,972
Rym: they're even like yeah You're lower middle class or you're like low class.

862
00:57:12,253 --> 00:57:15,410
Scott: those be more than one Parasite sucking on the same thing.

863
00:57:15,471 --> 00:57:17,180
Scott: and then those two parasites fight each other.

864
00:57:17,742 --> 00:57:28,479
Rym: Because because the real parasite is the really really rich family that's the parasite that's the movie Yep, and that I think is really driven home and that's like that.

865
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:37,940
Scott: But even the really really rich family is only the way they are because the way society is Yeah, like they've introduced the wife as being like really like mentally ill and broken.

866
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:40,226
Rym: But then you see how isolating her life is.

867
00:57:40,767 --> 00:57:47,199
Rym: the guy like he has like he doesn't understand how to interact with normal people Anymore because of the life he lives.

868
00:57:47,864 --> 00:57:56,120
Rym: but there's also that scene at the penultimate scene where Like the rich German family is moving into the house and how the rich people in all capitalist countries are the same.

869
00:57:56,241 --> 00:57:56,885
Rym: There's no difference.

870
00:57:57,127 --> 00:58:06,560
Rym: It doesn't matter who lives in the house You'll everyone in this movie like fills the role of the place and station that they have achieved.

871
00:58:07,505 --> 00:58:08,700
Rym: The rich families are all the same.

872
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:09,885
Rym: The poor families are all the same.

873
00:58:09,905 --> 00:58:14,878
Rym: the desperate families are all the same in terms of the struggles and like what they end up Being and doing in this world.

874
00:58:16,682 --> 00:58:22,158
Scott: The one thing that is starkly, you know, most of this is a universal tale of capitalism.

875
00:58:22,178 --> 00:58:27,760
Scott: Yeah, right You know, but the one thing that is starkly different is how?

876
00:58:29,241 --> 00:58:39,220
Scott: After you know the ultimate climax right with the stabbing and everything Right, the Sun is in the hospital right in the United States.

877
00:58:39,361 --> 00:58:40,599
Scott: The Sun would not be in the house.

878
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:44,353
Scott: Yeah, because we do not have the universal health care that South Korea has.

879
00:58:44,794 --> 00:58:46,320
Scott: right the Sun would be dead.

880
00:58:46,821 --> 00:58:54,567
Scott: right and also the justice system in South Korea at the end comes into play and It would not have treated those people.

881
00:58:54,888 --> 00:58:57,757
Scott: the United States justice system would not have treated those people the same way.

882
00:58:57,777 --> 00:59:06,756
Scott: the group did Right, so not to say that theirs is necessarily perfect or better or worse Some ways better but the health care is definitely better.

883
00:59:07,299 --> 00:59:10,059
Scott: Yes There is a stark difference there.

884
00:59:11,101 --> 00:59:18,320
Scott: That way is not universally true for all capitalism Right, like if you think about the gym scene even like after the flow in America.

885
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:21,130
Rym: No, those people would all just been totally fucked right?

886
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:24,180
Scott: It's like, you know, it's like okay the whole poor neighborhood flooded.

887
00:59:24,601 --> 00:59:29,398
Scott: Everyone went to sleep in a gymnasium and there was a pile of clothes to fight over in the morning, right?

888
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,646
Scott: It's like in the United States.

889
00:59:31,686 --> 00:59:33,152
Scott: that would not happen, right?

890
00:59:33,253 --> 00:59:39,359
Scott: I would just be stuck in your flooded house You have to pay for a hotel or sleep in your car or some of those people would just be dead.

891
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:41,065
Scott: Clothes is like yeah.

892
00:59:41,125 --> 00:59:42,974
Scott: No, you don't go to walk about clothes.

893
00:59:43,015 --> 00:59:44,120
Rym: check-offs toilet.

894
00:59:44,982 --> 00:59:48,709
Rym: Yeah, check-offs toilet big time They they they zoom in on that toilet.

895
00:59:48,729 --> 00:59:52,199
Rym: the toilets rate like and our friends our other Scott's house Like he has a toy.

896
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:54,046
Scott: It was kind of a. the effect that was.

897
00:59:54,086 --> 00:59:58,320
Scott: the one thing is the effect of the toilet burping up water.

898
00:59:58,541 --> 01:00:00,208
Scott: That was sort of that.

899
01:00:00,248 --> 01:00:03,040
Scott: it was sort of a. it was sort of a fakie kind of fun house effect.

900
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,450
Rym: No, that's why I've seen that happen.

901
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:05,678
Rym: That's what that looks like for real.

902
01:00:06,761 --> 01:00:08,490
Scott: Hey, Larry cartoon in a cartoon.

903
01:00:08,610 --> 01:00:16,980
Rym: I'm saying that is literally what a Below the like sewer line toilet looks like if there's a flood for real in the real world.

904
01:00:17,721 --> 01:00:19,307
Rym: All right, go look for videos of it.

905
01:00:19,367 --> 01:00:20,270
Rym: It's terrifying.

906
01:00:20,611 --> 01:00:22,940
Rym: You know that whole thing about the Pittsburgh toilet in the basement.

907
01:00:23,622 --> 01:00:36,379
Rym: Yeah, that's to prevent that from happening upstairs anyway, but the Like the scene where they're first they're attacking and trying to get the other parasite out because you know the whole.

908
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:41,480
Rym: in Capitalism the lower classes are basically tricked or forced into fighting with each other over the scraps.

909
01:00:41,881 --> 01:00:52,140
Rym: so of course the family that's slightly better off now than the earlier parasite like oh We're poor but at least we're not on the run from loan sharks like right.

910
01:00:52,140 --> 01:01:07,789
Scott: Well, I think what what had happened is they had that the family right acts didn't realize that they were bumping out another parasite right now the you know much like they were faking it and Appearing to the rich family to be better off than they were.

911
01:01:08,190 --> 01:01:17,215
Scott: right they were putting on airs of being you know More not wealthy, but you know morally respectable in one way right above their own class.

912
01:01:17,316 --> 01:01:23,271
Scott: right their smell gave them away But so was that housekeeper right.

913
01:01:23,371 --> 01:01:26,180
Scott: that housekeeper was also putting on airs and ended up fooling.

914
01:01:26,421 --> 01:01:28,819
Scott: So that's why they didn't have any qualms about getting rid of her.

915
01:01:29,302 --> 01:01:30,850
Scott: Right because they thought they were fooled.

916
01:01:30,930 --> 01:01:32,579
Scott: also that that person was.

917
01:01:33,083 --> 01:01:33,789
Scott: They were.

918
01:01:33,809 --> 01:01:36,565
Rym: if you look at the situation She was in with her husband.

919
01:01:37,006 --> 01:01:40,056
Rym: they need this help way more than this family does.

920
01:01:40,096 --> 01:01:41,440
Rym: they're way more fucked.

921
01:01:42,188 --> 01:01:43,300
Scott: Oh, yeah, absolutely.

922
01:01:43,741 --> 01:01:48,677
Rym: But this family takes this moral superiority angle of you're that your parasites get out.

923
01:01:48,737 --> 01:01:49,560
Rym: you're breaking the law.

924
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:50,444
Rym: We'll get rid of you.

925
01:01:50,464 --> 01:01:52,151
Scott: It's like well you are too.

926
01:01:52,171 --> 01:01:56,608
Rym: Yeah, well especially Because they're well like I'm actually.

927
01:01:56,628 --> 01:02:14,282
Rym: I want to get back to the smell thing first because I found that scene really interesting the scene where you finally have the rich people by themselves and you basically have this scene where you have the poor dad Like hiding and he hears what the rich people actually say and think in their normal lives And how yep

928
01:02:14,442 --> 01:02:15,545
Scott: before it up until

929
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:20,820
Rym: that bid and and just classist it is and like what they think of the people around them.

930
01:02:21,281 --> 01:02:28,080
Scott: Yep up until that point, you know, the rich people are shown as you know, naive people who happen to be wealthy.

931
01:02:28,361 --> 01:02:29,584
Scott: They don't do anything.

932
01:02:29,604 --> 01:02:31,570
Scott: that's explicitly evil.

933
01:02:31,851 --> 01:02:43,763
Scott: You don't see them exploiting anyone, you know directly Right, like they're paying their employees very well like that's like that everything seems right like the face like it's like yeah They're rich.

934
01:02:44,063 --> 01:03:03,500
Scott: Yeah, they clearly don't understand the non-rich world, but you know, they're not like Actively, you know Reprehensible people right but you know and but every interaction you see with them is with you know Between them and others right between them and the you know, their employees

935
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:05,807
Rym: Yeah, but when there's no one else around right

936
01:03:05,887 --> 01:03:19,080
Scott: and then it's not until that point you see them just talking to each other right and Not to someone in a different class and then they reveal their you know, their true their true nature, right?

937
01:03:19,903 --> 01:03:27,812
Rym: And there's also the bit there's a little bit when they first displaced the housekeeper like they finally like secured their space and now they're the they're the.

938
01:03:28,153 --> 01:03:29,477
Rym: they've made their parasite life.

939
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:41,023
Rym: they Really convinced themselves that that housekeeper will just find another job somewhere Because they don't want to face the consequences of the displacement They have caused.

940
01:03:41,525 --> 01:03:46,287
Rym: yet then when they have to escape and they cause that horrific head injury And I remember when that happened.

941
01:03:46,327 --> 01:03:49,184
Rym: The first thing I thought was wow, she has to go to hospital She's gonna die.

942
01:03:49,204 --> 01:03:53,807
Rym: and I was really glad that this movie like yeah, that's exactly what happens Like she doesn't make it.

943
01:03:53,947 --> 01:03:55,996
Scott: She's just tied up to a lot of people don't make it.

944
01:03:56,096 --> 01:04:26,148
Scott: Yeah So another so related back though to the what the the rich people right so early in the movie There's a scene where you know The the husband the rich husband and wife are discussing the underwear that they found that was planted in the driver's car Right, which is how they got rid of the old driver and got the dad to replace him, right and You know, the the the wife is like, oh, you know She's like gasp at the mention of like drugs.

945
01:04:26,229 --> 01:04:30,705
Scott: if you have to understand this South Korea even like, you know drugs That would be like legal here.

946
01:04:30,865 --> 01:04:33,754
Scott: even over-the-counter would like get you a jail there, right?

947
01:04:34,336 --> 01:04:35,600
Scott: They got way stricter laws.

948
01:04:36,024 --> 01:04:37,220
Scott: It's actually a big problem.

949
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:44,880
Scott: It's like a negative thing a lot of times like drugs that you can get here which you should like especially a lot of psychiatric drugs.

950
01:04:45,222 --> 01:04:47,016
Scott: Yes, psychiatric drugs, especially.

951
01:04:47,117 --> 01:04:57,840
Scott: but you know even like you do some you think you get in trouble for doing weed in the US somewhere where there's if you're black and The cops hate you it's like, you know, if you're anyone and you got weed in South Korea, you are fucked, right?

952
01:04:59,581 --> 01:05:05,460
Scott: You know, but anyway, so the mother the rich mother gasping about drugs like oh, oh, right.

953
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:09,880
Rym: But they're also like weirdly turned on by like ooh the lower class stuff, right?

954
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:12,060
Scott: But then later on in the movie, right?

955
01:05:12,922 --> 01:05:15,596
Scott: When she's getting it on she's like, oh buy me drugs, right?

956
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:20,694
Rym: No, she's like role-playing the prostitute that they imagined like.

957
01:05:20,814 --> 01:05:22,902
Scott: right exactly, you know It's like.

958
01:05:22,942 --> 01:05:28,087
Scott: and the dad's like, you know, if you wore those panties I found in the car I'd be really turned on by that.

959
01:05:28,108 --> 01:05:28,851
Scott: You know, it's like.

960
01:05:29,011 --> 01:05:32,926
Rym: I think that is the unsexiest sex scene I've ever seen in any movie ever.

961
01:05:33,047 --> 01:05:36,439
Scott: It's not supposed to be exactly supposed to be you know.

962
01:05:38,062 --> 01:05:39,208
Scott: But yeah, there are.

963
01:05:39,489 --> 01:05:41,600
Scott: but also it's just another illustration.

964
01:05:42,022 --> 01:05:43,389
Scott: It adds on because you know.

965
01:05:43,429 --> 01:05:49,117
Scott: at the same time you see, you know The the rich people speaking truly to each other, right?

966
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:56,471
Scott: They also draw that contrast by you know Showing you how they spoke when someone else is there versus when someone else is.

967
01:05:56,491 --> 01:06:10,240
Rym: and then there's also a running theme with the lights And with a bunch of other things around each level of the society portrayed in this house Doesn't understand the true plight of the ones lower than them and assume they're way better off than they are.

968
01:06:10,721 --> 01:06:12,466
Rym: And I think that's really shown the lights.

969
01:06:13,088 --> 01:06:13,669
Rym: I love that.

970
01:06:13,709 --> 01:06:44,370
Rym: just the allegory there of the the rich guy Appears to have just assumed his entire time that he's lived in this house that those lights are automatic like oh the light that's just a feature of the house and You learn that it's literally the crazy guy in the basement doing it out of his weird hero worship of the rich guy Mm-hmm, like the rich guy not understanding like the sausage-making that makes his life possible Like he has no idea what normal people are like at all.

971
01:06:44,551 --> 01:06:55,210
Rym: he doesn't understand the things that are easy for him or just happen for him are happening because of the Dangerous and insane efforts of others who are far more exploited by society.

972
01:06:55,572 --> 01:07:05,530
Scott: And then you see that paralleled in every interaction in the movie all the way down to the bottom Mm-hmm, but yeah, that's you know, that's also it seems is a lot of things like that which are like less.

973
01:07:05,731 --> 01:07:07,902
Scott: They're not you know, rather than running throughout the movie.

974
01:07:07,922 --> 01:07:14,508
Scott: There's sort of like, you know one-off Non-subtle allegories right of you know showing other aspects of.

975
01:07:14,528 --> 01:07:16,996
Scott: you know The parasitic capitalist relationship.

976
01:07:17,137 --> 01:07:27,449
Scott: and there's one where it's like yeah, you know, despite the rich people being the problem We're gonna show you this thing that happens in the real world Which is people who are really poor worshipping the really rich people, right?

977
01:07:28,552 --> 01:07:30,830
Rym: Twitter stans like think Elon Musk is some kind of guy.

978
01:07:30,870 --> 01:07:31,753
Scott: I was just gonna say.

979
01:07:31,813 --> 01:07:36,490
Scott: it's like Elon Musk dick is sucked by so many people who should be just stabbing him.

980
01:07:37,795 --> 01:07:39,310
Scott: Evil dude is an evil dude.

981
01:07:39,390 --> 01:07:43,383
Scott: He's basically Lex Luthor, but even worse possibly, you know and real.

982
01:07:43,885 --> 01:07:47,521
Scott: and yet people are like, you know Kicks it kissing his ass right.

983
01:07:47,561 --> 01:07:49,290
Scott: you have no money and nothing, right?

984
01:07:49,770 --> 01:07:51,295
Scott: It's like the same thing you are.

985
01:07:51,396 --> 01:08:00,464
Scott: if you are that person then you are that dude in the basement in parasite You know singing the praises of the rich guy bang in your head against the light switches.

986
01:08:01,005 --> 01:08:01,627
Scott: Yeah, that's you.

987
01:08:01,647 --> 01:08:04,304
Scott: so Shut up with the Elon Musk.

988
01:08:04,647 --> 01:08:08,150
Rym: Yep And there's a lot more we could say but we've gone on for a while.

989
01:08:08,331 --> 01:08:08,873
Scott: You could do.

990
01:08:09,215 --> 01:08:11,062
Scott: probably a whole series of you can make.

991
01:08:11,103 --> 01:08:11,766
Rym: a podcast like.

992
01:08:12,067 --> 01:08:16,810
Rym: this is one of those movies You could just you could spend hours writing essays on lit crit of all the directorial decisions.

993
01:08:16,950 --> 01:08:20,125
Rym: Everything in this movie is done on purpose and the movie is just very well done.

994
01:08:20,145 --> 01:08:24,889
Rym: So We'll keep the conversation going in the discord in the forum, I guess.

995
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:31,729
Scott: Oh The only other one thing I did want to mention though is the the house, right?

996
01:08:32,510 --> 01:08:37,609
Scott: The not only is you know, the the house is sort of like a character in the movie, right?

997
01:08:37,770 --> 01:08:38,111
Scott: It's made.

998
01:08:38,272 --> 01:08:43,207
Scott: it was supposedly made by this famous architect who lived there previously and had the same housekeeper previously.

999
01:08:43,227 --> 01:08:47,050
Scott: to the story I don't know the true story of the real house, even though it is a real house.

1000
01:08:48,031 --> 01:08:49,919
Rym: The parks house was a specially constructed set.

1001
01:08:50,019 --> 01:08:50,562
Rym: I just looked it up.

1002
01:08:51,265 --> 01:08:51,586
Scott: Okay.

1003
01:08:51,707 --> 01:08:52,490
Scott: I thought it was a real house.

1004
01:08:52,550 --> 01:08:55,161
Rym: Ground-floor in the garden were on an empty outdoor a lot.

1005
01:08:55,261 --> 01:08:57,109
Rym: the basement and the first floor were on a set.

1006
01:08:57,794 --> 01:08:58,479
Rym: There was okay house.

1007
01:08:59,163 --> 01:08:59,345
Scott: Okay.

1008
01:08:59,365 --> 01:08:59,970
Scott: It was a fake house.

1009
01:09:00,029 --> 01:09:11,309
Scott: But the point is that this the shape of that house right is so important to the film Right in the way the different shots that they set up in the house, right?

1010
01:09:12,390 --> 01:09:16,044
Scott: You know like the upstairs scenes are sort of like in this other world right.

1011
01:09:16,104 --> 01:09:17,649
Scott: the basement scene, right?

1012
01:09:17,930 --> 01:09:20,670
Scott: That's another neck old right the basement is another world.

1013
01:09:20,729 --> 01:09:25,750
Scott: But the entrance to the basement and that narrow sort of doorway in the kitchen with the stairs, right?

1014
01:09:26,290 --> 01:09:33,523
Scott: So it's like, you know, you see Where someone ascends or descends those basement stairs, especially where the guy.

1015
01:09:33,563 --> 01:09:36,229
Scott: you can see the guy's eyes coming out from the basement.

1016
01:09:36,571 --> 01:09:39,441
Rym: That was actually a really creepy shot like what that's high.

1017
01:09:39,501 --> 01:09:45,712
Scott: and then you learn the story of how the kid got scared Right when he was young and had a seizure You know.

1018
01:09:45,792 --> 01:09:50,649
Scott: and then there's the main the main big room right with the glass going outwards, right?

1019
01:09:51,272 --> 01:10:02,490
Scott: and there's just so many shots in the movie that I think you know, obviously telling me it's a fake house makes more sense because You know you look at you know, I thought they just got lucky with the house and like filmed around it geniusly.

1020
01:10:02,711 --> 01:10:03,193
Scott: But it's like.

1021
01:10:03,253 --> 01:10:04,579
Scott: no they planned like.

1022
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:06,910
Scott: oh, yeah, you know at this scene, right?

1023
01:10:06,970 --> 01:10:09,941
Scott: It's like they're inside talking looking out the glass.

1024
01:10:10,001 --> 01:10:12,450
Scott: the light comes in the windows, right?

1025
01:10:12,550 --> 01:10:12,931
Scott: You know the.

1026
01:10:13,232 --> 01:10:14,174
Scott: they set up the.

1027
01:10:14,515 --> 01:10:20,050
Scott: you know, the birthday party outside the walkie-talkie going in and out through the windows, right?

1028
01:10:20,491 --> 01:10:34,769
Scott: it's like the shape of the house is like, you know matches the the story of the movie while also The camera, you know the filming of the movie right is like designed around the shape of this house, right?

1029
01:10:36,270 --> 01:10:39,650
Scott: You know to create the scenes and the shots that they needed, right?

1030
01:10:40,611 --> 01:10:55,745
Scott: So it's really you know, kind of trying to think like other movies that did similar things Right where they had a. you know, it's almost it's not quite a one-room thing like a glass menagerie kind of deal But most of the action horror in that one area and I'm reading about.

1031
01:10:55,765 --> 01:11:00,589
Rym: they spent a lot of time Trying to make that set exactly perfect for these shots.

1032
01:11:01,245 --> 01:11:10,866
Rym: Yeah Like they thought a lot about the furniture in that room to set establish the idea that the family spends most of their time in That room when they're recreating because that room connects to the outside garden.

1033
01:11:10,886 --> 01:11:15,539
Scott: Yep I mean even though it's a wealthy clearly a wealthy house.

1034
01:11:16,121 --> 01:11:17,965
Scott: It's not actually that large right?

1035
01:11:17,985 --> 01:11:22,819
Scott: It's like bedrooms a giant Recreational room with glass a yard.

1036
01:11:22,839 --> 01:11:23,341
Scott: I'm not gonna lie.

1037
01:11:23,381 --> 01:11:24,706
Rym: That house looks amazing.

1038
01:11:25,067 --> 01:11:25,690
Scott: I'd love to live there.

1039
01:11:25,750 --> 01:11:26,954
Rym: I would do it.

1040
01:11:27,275 --> 01:11:29,141
Scott: an extra fancy kitchen a storage base.

1041
01:11:29,162 --> 01:11:31,429
Rym: Would you murder someone with a scholar stone to live there?

1042
01:11:32,970 --> 01:11:33,423
Scott: depends who.

1043
01:11:36,131 --> 01:11:39,022
Scott: But anyway, yeah, so the I just really appreciate what was the.

1044
01:11:39,123 --> 01:11:45,181
Rym: Oh Mirai is which is all Anime, I also said it like a special architect designed house.

1045
01:11:45,863 --> 01:11:47,708
Scott: Yeah, but that's about an architect.

1046
01:11:47,949 --> 01:11:55,734
Scott: true May you could see as Mirai is a prequel to parasite if the houses are a little bit similar Not completely though.

1047
01:11:56,155 --> 01:11:57,740
Scott: They didn't have a housekeeper in Mirai either.

Rym: I wanted highlight.

1061
01:12:44,076 --> 01:12:46,244
Rym: So the way patreon works the spreadsheet.

1062
01:12:46,465 --> 01:12:50,789
Rym: unless I export it into a bunch of stuff I have to hover over a tooltip to see any long names.

1063
01:12:52,131 --> 01:13:08,098
Rym: Well, the plane landed and when I came out Clinton Walton, Jay Vance, Ren from New Zealand, Ryan Perrin, Nicholas Brando Chris Midkiff, Dred Lilly Tenebrae, Chris Reimer, Finn, Shervin von Horl, and a bunch of people who don't want me to say their names Yeah, I got nothing can't really go anywhere.

1064
01:13:08,239 --> 01:13:13,442
Rym: So for now, I'll just leave you with something from somewhere Darryl, I don't have time to talk right now.

1065
01:13:13,462 --> 01:13:13,865
Rym: Yeah, I know.

1066
01:13:18,530 --> 01:13:22,208
Rym: No, well cuz somebody went in and clicked the recoup base encryption hash key button.

1067
01:13:23,331 --> 01:13:23,872
Rym: What's that do?

1068
01:13:24,454 --> 01:13:28,567
Rym: Well, it pretty much means we have to reset everyone's password on every server and a whole enterprise.

1069
01:13:28,607 --> 01:13:30,535
Rym: So, uh You know who clicked it?

1070
01:13:30,656 --> 01:13:31,199
Rym: No, man.

1071
01:13:31,802 --> 01:13:33,210
Rym: I'm just helping with a sales meeting right now.

1072
01:13:33,330 --> 01:13:44,410
Rym: So well since you're logged into the box here and it's running under your username I just thought I'd ask you huh, and you know I can see from the squid log here that you did just do a search for recoup you'd encryption hash key.

1073
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:46,216
Rym: So it seems like you might know.

1074
01:13:46,337 --> 01:13:47,742
Rym: all right inspector Darryl.

1075
01:13:47,862 --> 01:13:48,324
Rym: I clicked it.

1076
01:13:48,344 --> 01:13:49,448
Rym: It's right next to the apply button.

1077
01:13:49,468 --> 01:13:51,587
Rym: I mean Do you know how we fix it?

1078
01:13:53,051 --> 01:13:57,010
Scott: We ain't doing anything but you need to get busy resetting everybody's password and you can't do it remotely.

1079
01:13:57,010 --> 01:14:01,030
Scott: You're gonna have to come down here with a recovery CD and start going up and down the rows popping it in the box.

1080
01:14:01,333 --> 01:14:01,940
Rym: What do you mean?

1081
01:14:02,021 --> 01:14:02,690
Rym: every password?

1082
01:14:04,890 --> 01:14:05,453
Rym: It doesn't make.

1083
01:14:05,573 --> 01:14:09,250
Rym: it doesn't make sense that that one button has that effect on every password.

1084
01:14:14,790 --> 01:14:18,646
Rym: All right, listen, um Darryl, I they're trying to get in on the VPN.

1085
01:14:18,667 --> 01:14:19,390
Rym: so I got to deal with that.

1086
01:14:23,131 --> 01:14:26,206
Rym: I'm sure they'll understand, you know, I'm gonna get fired.

1087
01:14:26,326 --> 01:14:27,009
Rym: is what's gonna happen?

1088
01:14:32,991 --> 01:14:34,196
Rym: You can fix this stuff up anytime.

1089
01:14:34,216 --> 01:14:36,727
Rym: you fix the virus attack, you know, I mean you do that.

1090
01:14:37,209 --> 01:14:39,304
Scott: Yeah Hell yeah, you think I made it 30 years an ID.

1091
01:14:39,748 --> 01:14:40,010
Scott: All right.
