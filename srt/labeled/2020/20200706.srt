00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,669
Rym: It's Monday July 6th 2020.

2
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:14,456
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:14,476 --> 00:00:18,719
Rym: We are talking about quotes obsolete unquote technology.

4
00:00:20,201 --> 00:00:21,218
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:26,200
Rym: So, uh, you know, we can't.

6
00:00:26,481 --> 00:00:37,172
Rym: I can't do a lot of the things I would normally do During the summer in the quarantine like I can't go to the beach I can't do the super long bike rides or like bike rides that require me to take a train or anything Like.

7
00:00:37,233 --> 00:00:42,479
Rym: I'm kind of limited to the area I can get to Can't do any organized bike ride with other people.

8
00:00:42,921 --> 00:00:43,182
Rym: Yep.

9
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:49,895
Rym: So what I'm increasingly trying to do is Find new ways to interact with the spaces I have access to.

10
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:55,828
Rym: so on Thursday cuz we had a long weekend Thursday was last day of work Emily and I we went out to bike up and down the west side.

11
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:59,090
Rym: now You might say but Rym the west side is just a normal bike path.

12
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:02,661
Rym: You can go bike there anytime and I often would normally during kovin.

13
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:16,345
Rym: that bike path because it's really nice is Crazy crowded during the day like more people are walking and riding up and down that west side path that goes from the bottom of Manhattan to the top of Manhattan now then are like on a normal summer like it's

14
00:01:16,425 --> 00:01:16,846
Scott: also not.

15
00:01:16,886 --> 00:01:19,400
Scott: it's also even if it's empty It's not a great path.

16
00:01:19,521 --> 00:01:20,449
Scott: It's like you do it.

17
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:25,990
Scott: It's like you do it a few times and then eventually you're like the novelty wears off like well tip of Manhattan again.

18
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:44,339
Rym: Usually I usually like you head north on it and then you go over a bridge and you keep going north Mmm, so anyway, what we did is around 11 11 30 p.m On Thursday, we went and got our bikes and we went over there to bike around up and down the west side in the middle of the night.

19
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:48,503
Rym: Okay, that context makes it really fun.

20
00:01:48,543 --> 00:01:50,410
Rym: Like that was really worth doing.

21
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:52,498
Rym: There's a lot of different animals out.

22
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:57,635
Rym: There's a very different type of person who's hanging out in those parks In the middle of the night.

23
00:01:58,176 --> 00:01:58,678
Rym: there were some.

24
00:01:58,978 --> 00:02:00,783
Rym: there were some chill parties going on.

25
00:02:00,823 --> 00:02:14,950
Rym: there was some stuff I saw that was fascinating But that was a very fun experience and I intend to All the paths I have biked to death during the day over the last decade in New York.

26
00:02:15,271 --> 00:02:18,668
Rym: I'm gonna do every one of those bike rides again in the middle of the night.

27
00:02:20,092 --> 00:02:28,258
Scott: Okay, the problem is a lot of the places to bike in the middle of the night are places that are Too much car and you'll die because it's night.

28
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:31,950
Rym: and though there's a lot more than usual in this a lot.

29
00:02:32,091 --> 00:02:34,290
Scott: Yeah, there's a lot of closed places.

30
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,013
Rym: Yeah, a lot.

31
00:02:35,053 --> 00:02:38,950
Rym: some bridges and bike paths closed some parks closed, but the west side never closes.

32
00:02:39,832 --> 00:02:40,839
Scott: No, it's just it's open.

33
00:02:40,859 --> 00:02:41,625
Scott: You can't close it.

34
00:02:41,685 --> 00:02:41,988
Scott: Really.

35
00:02:42,068 --> 00:02:48,762
Rym: Yep I think technically the parks next to it are closed after dusk, but the path itself is not Mmm.

36
00:02:49,498 --> 00:02:50,268
Rym: Alright, you got any news?

37
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:51,973
Scott: Do I have this?

38
00:02:52,094 --> 00:02:54,003
Scott: Oh, yeah, so check it out.

39
00:02:54,023 --> 00:03:06,530
Scott: these people announce this camera right called the pixie camera and At its core this camera is actually a kind of good to great idea and concept, right?

40
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:09,670
Scott: So first of all, it has a Leica lens mount.

41
00:03:09,971 --> 00:03:11,454
Scott: So like like.

42
00:03:11,515 --> 00:03:15,846
Scott: a cameras are like, you know, the ultimate luxury brand of camera.

43
00:03:15,886 --> 00:03:21,110
Scott: They're super duper expensive But they are sort of unique, right?

44
00:03:22,231 --> 00:03:24,076
Scott: So it's sort of like they're not.

45
00:03:24,157 --> 00:03:28,910
Scott: they're not good and better enough to be worth the insane insane price, right?

46
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:37,750
Scott: but they are Unique and cool and their lenses are very high quality Even though they cost like, you know way way way more than other lenses.

47
00:03:37,911 --> 00:03:41,790
Rym: I own one like a lens my entire my drive one.

48
00:03:42,693 --> 00:03:46,406
Rym: I don't think you have in any though that my camcorder has a like a made lens in it.

49
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:47,994
Scott: Oh That's it.

50
00:03:48,035 --> 00:03:51,729
Scott: That's not the same as It's not the same as a like a m mount.

51
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:56,870
Rym: Yeah, it's not like a m mount lens, but like a m mount lens cost more than your entire camcorders.

52
00:03:59,451 --> 00:04:07,518
Scott: So if you want to use those lenses maybe you have one or there are some other companies that have made lenses for the m mount which You know, it's like.

53
00:04:07,559 --> 00:04:13,732
Scott: well if you want to use one of those lenses Even if you get a cheap one like Voigtlander makes some right which are still expensive but cheaper It's like.

54
00:04:13,752 --> 00:04:27,289
Scott: well you have to get some like a camera or there are some cameras you can get like a Bessa I think mates an m mount film camera, but there really aren't M mount digital cameras out there right other than the Leica ones which cost a fortune, right?

55
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:32,950
Scott: So they're making a digital camera that has a Leica M mount on it and it's and it's not a like a camera.

56
00:04:33,071 --> 00:04:34,698
Scott: So it's like oh, that's that's good.

57
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:44,675
Scott: Right and it's a rangefinder format camera Which is what like makes and there aren't enough digital rangefinder cameras out there that are high quality Other than like Fuji and Leica.

58
00:04:44,816 --> 00:04:45,718
Scott: right.

59
00:04:46,521 --> 00:04:49,790
Scott: and the other thing is this camera doesn't have an LCD screen on it.

60
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,777
Scott: Which if you have a rangefinder, what do you need a?

61
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:53,483
Scott: what do you need LCD screen for?

62
00:04:53,944 --> 00:04:55,008
Scott: right it just.

63
00:04:55,329 --> 00:05:02,889
Scott: you know Most digital cameras these days have the feature where you hook it up to an app on your phone and it sends the photos Over to the phone pretty much immediately.

64
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:13,385
Scott: Yeah phones already got a really good screen like every single like even my Panasonic GF2 had that feature But my gh5 has it gh4 had it One has it.

65
00:05:14,552 --> 00:05:23,308
Scott: Might you may be surprised Jack using Wi-Fi slash Bluetooth my Fuji GF whatever it is 100 whatever has it right?

66
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,804
Scott: So You know, it's a common feature, but they're like, hey, we have that feature now.

67
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:30,490
Scott: Why do we need the LCD screen?

68
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:35,588
Scott: We'll just have a little tiny screen on top for your settings your battery life, you know that sort of thing, right?

69
00:05:36,931 --> 00:05:41,939
Scott: And we'll have a little tiny little bit of memory in the camera to buffer up the photos, right and then we'll send them Over to your phone.

70
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,881
Scott: So you just look at your phone Which is a better screen than we can put on the back of.

71
00:05:44,921 --> 00:05:46,590
Rym: this can reminds me of what was the Sony?

72
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,625
Rym: Where it's just like a lens and the lens just sent the images directly to your phone.

73
00:05:50,645 --> 00:05:51,910
Scott: Yeah, exactly, right.

74
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:56,565
Scott: So this is actually like in concept like hey, it's like I kind of want that.

75
00:05:56,585 --> 00:05:57,729
Scott: That's pretty great, right?

76
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:08,951
Scott: so here's where it stops getting great is a. The sensor in this camera is only 11 megapixels so 11 11 11.1.

77
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,097
Scott: So and it's a PSC.

78
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:18,310
Scott: so The Leica lenses are designed for like full-frame sensors, which is what are in the Leica M cameras.

79
00:06:19,332 --> 00:06:28,010
Scott: Right, even the older ones like the Leica 8 and 9 have full-frame sensors Even though the Leica nines has a better as more megapixels than this the like.

80
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:31,018
Rym: Let me put $10,000 racing tires on my Corolla, right?

81
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:37,908
Scott: So the thing is I'm not like a megapixel fiend like who cares if you're not printing out the image?

82
00:06:37,948 --> 00:06:38,530
Scott: super enormous.

83
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:39,755
Scott: You don't need all those megapixels.

84
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:42,445
Rym: Yeah, I'm not making billboards right exactly.

85
00:06:42,706 --> 00:06:53,410
Scott: But the point is that You know, it's like hey 11 megapixels, it's like you just use the cat if your phone is the screen the phone has a camera.

86
00:06:53,571 --> 00:06:57,313
Scott: Yeah, so it's a carry around any camera That's not.

87
00:06:57,374 --> 00:06:59,981
Scott: the phone has to be better than the phone.

88
00:07:00,964 --> 00:07:03,953
Scott: I don't think this is better than the phone camera Right.

89
00:07:04,494 --> 00:07:05,798
Scott: So that's problem number one.

90
00:07:06,299 --> 00:07:10,129
Scott: The big problem though is they're charging how much money for this, right?

91
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:12,073
Scott: $3,000.

92
00:07:12,073 --> 00:07:17,987
Scott: now that might make sense because a like a digital camera the Leica m10 costs like $8,000.

93
00:07:17,987 --> 00:07:27,008
Rym: Yeah Right now no just for perspective my Busted like four-year-old Android phone has a 19 megapixel sensor, right?

94
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:27,630
Scott: Right.

95
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:39,129
Scott: so if you wanted to write if you wanted to get a Leica m9 like a used one right which is a full-frame sensor That's been a takes the same lenses and is better than this and has a screen on it.

96
00:07:39,551 --> 00:07:41,701
Scott: You can get one of those for two to three thousand dollars.

97
00:07:41,741 --> 00:07:47,619
Scott: So cheaper than the pixie Right, but the real killer is that you could get.

98
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:49,865
Scott: this has an aps-c sensor right now full-frame.

99
00:07:50,346 --> 00:07:54,478
Scott: you could get a Fuji Like X Pro 3 or whatever.

100
00:07:54,518 --> 00:07:55,481
Scott: It's called right.

101
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:58,490
Scott: the Fuji makes rangefinder digital cameras.

102
00:07:58,771 --> 00:08:02,610
Scott: Yeah, tell it has a Fuji mount on it, right as opposed to a Leica M mount.

103
00:08:03,031 --> 00:08:06,685
Scott: But that thing only costs like $1,800, right and sure it has a screen on it.

104
00:08:08,651 --> 00:08:10,617
Scott: But it also does hurting me.

105
00:08:10,677 --> 00:08:12,241
Scott: it's cool, it's also vastly.

106
00:08:12,622 --> 00:08:15,370
Scott: it's vastly superior to this camera in every way.

107
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,420
Rym: Hey, this doesn't even have a SD slot.

108
00:08:17,561 --> 00:08:19,149
Rym: You can't even put a card into it, right?

109
00:08:19,911 --> 00:08:20,212
Scott: Exactly.

110
00:08:20,232 --> 00:08:22,644
Rym: My phone doesn't have enough storage to keep all the raws.

111
00:08:22,664 --> 00:08:27,697
Rym: I take when I go out My phone does.

112
00:08:27,837 --> 00:08:31,935
Scott: but the point is is that Four-year-old busted Android.

113
00:08:31,955 --> 00:08:33,701
Rym: I've got a 60 this camera would make.

114
00:08:34,304 --> 00:08:36,030
Scott: this camera would make a ton of sense.

115
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:42,850
Scott: It'd be amazing if it cost a few hundred dollars and maybe it was micro 4/3 and maybe had a better sensor.

116
00:08:43,692 --> 00:08:46,819
Scott: You know micro 4/3 wouldn't help it right, but just a better sensor.

117
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,102
Scott: But yeah charging $3,000.

118
00:08:48,102 --> 00:08:51,590
Scott: The thing makes no sense whatsoever to exist.

119
00:08:51,712 --> 00:08:52,548
Scott: I don't understand.

120
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:56,064
Scott: Why would anyone would buy this ever even if you're rich.

121
00:08:56,425 --> 00:08:57,530
Scott: if you're rich you can just buy a life.

122
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:01,770
Rym: So I do get the impression there's a weird segment of the camera market.

123
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:16,930
Rym: That's because I've seen like ads and people talking about this specific area in the business world of trying to sell like Cameras to people who use their cell phone for most photos but perceive that a handheld camera will do better.

124
00:09:17,371 --> 00:09:20,258
Scott: But handheld camera will do better if you buy one that's better.

125
00:09:20,378 --> 00:09:30,764
Rym: Yep, but who don't know how to use photography and in practice Want to interact with their photos entirely on their phone like they just want?

126
00:09:30,985 --> 00:09:34,616
Rym: it's like an accessory to their phone The accessories the wealth.

127
00:09:34,737 --> 00:09:38,269
Scott: so first of all, this is $3,000 so it's hitting only luxury people, right?

128
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:42,589
Rym: Somebody doesn't know that their iPhone is probably literally better than this.

129
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:53,710
Scott: So what I see so what I have seen from the celebrity Instagram crowd Right is people buying Leica cameras that are not the m10 the Leica ones that are easier to use, right?

130
00:09:54,651 --> 00:09:56,098
Scott: And I've seen them buying.

131
00:09:56,219 --> 00:09:58,630
Scott: also a very popular thing to do is get film cameras.

132
00:09:59,011 --> 00:10:10,204
Scott: So the context g2 is like an old film camera that's sort of like an instant kind of 35 millimeter deal That does have sort of interchangeable lenses and it's become it's still.

133
00:10:10,224 --> 00:10:14,290
Scott: it has become crazy popular And the price of it is very vastly inflated.

134
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,914
Rym: What are the listeners even said?

135
00:10:15,934 --> 00:10:20,346
Rym: you can get a full-frame Sony a7ri 42 megapixel for less than this.

136
00:10:20,827 --> 00:10:21,429
Scott: Yes, you can.

137
00:10:22,513 --> 00:10:28,677
Scott: So this and I and you know what you can also connect your phone to that and get your photos sent directly over Right, so I don't know why.

138
00:10:29,038 --> 00:10:30,484
Scott: what they're thinking with this camera?

139
00:10:30,604 --> 00:10:32,010
Scott: it makes it makes no sense.

140
00:10:34,352 --> 00:10:36,344
Scott: Yeah, it just makes no sense to me at this price.

141
00:10:36,424 --> 00:10:38,571
Scott: it should be like $200.

142
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:39,274
Scott: Then it would be amazing.

143
00:10:39,314 --> 00:10:42,668
Scott: I might buy one like $200 right just to you know, why not?

144
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:44,612
Scott: So yeah, that's a thing.

145
00:10:45,514 --> 00:10:48,101
Scott: and then it's sort of related camera news, right?

146
00:10:48,262 --> 00:10:52,431
Scott: Olympus the only maker of micro four-thirds Cameras.

147
00:10:52,872 --> 00:10:57,889
Scott: well, not the only I mean there are a few other ones like black magic makes a few and such and such.

148
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:13,648
Scott: but the only major manufacturer of micro four-thirds cameras besides Panasonic Olympus has sold their camera their consumer You know camera division to this other Japanese company and that oh my air conditioner is still on making noise.

149
00:11:13,929 --> 00:11:14,230
Rym: That's fine.

150
00:11:14,411 --> 00:11:15,776
Rym: No, mine's on to buy did.

151
00:11:16,057 --> 00:11:16,780
Scott: like though it is.

152
00:11:17,042 --> 00:11:17,142
Scott: Yeah.

153
00:11:17,162 --> 00:11:17,383
Scott: All right.

154
00:11:17,483 --> 00:11:17,825
Scott: I'm leaving.

155
00:11:17,905 --> 00:11:18,488
Rym: I'm leaving it on.

156
00:11:18,508 --> 00:11:18,990
Rym: that's fine.

157
00:11:19,493 --> 00:11:23,386
Scott: Deal with the deal with the noise listener, it's outside Yeah.

158
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:32,170
Scott: So they have sold their camera business to some other Japanese company and that Japanese company is basically a shady liquidator.

159
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:37,530
Rym: So I had an article that was my original link for this news that went out into a lot more depth about the liquidator.

160
00:11:37,832 --> 00:11:39,947
Rym: I got a 404 and I tried to go back to that page.

161
00:11:40,008 --> 00:11:40,350
Rym: So I'm like.

162
00:11:41,972 --> 00:11:52,090
Scott: Yeah, anyway, the point is Yeah, what this means for the future of micro four-thirds as a camera platform is sort of like a who-knows kind of deal.

163
00:11:52,391 --> 00:11:54,699
Scott: Right Panasonic could keep it alive or not.

164
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,710
Scott: It's open so people can still make those cameras.

165
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:03,078
Rym: It sounds the only other company you probably could keep it like fully alive because they have Panasonic.

166
00:12:03,239 --> 00:12:04,184
Scott: right, right.

167
00:12:04,204 --> 00:12:04,867
Scott: So so does a limp.

168
00:12:04,887 --> 00:12:12,648
Scott: but Panasonic Has you know added and they are making those other cameras that have a full-frame sensor?

169
00:12:12,869 --> 00:12:16,340
Scott: Oh, yeah Which has their their partner with Leica.

170
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,187
Scott: It's the L mount cameras, right?

171
00:12:18,207 --> 00:12:20,772
Scott: So It's like.

172
00:12:20,933 --> 00:12:27,419
Scott: well, they're still making micro four-thirds stuff, but they have also launched this other line of You know cameras, right?

173
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,590
Scott: So will they continue mega four-thirds or not?

174
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:39,476
Scott: so if micro four-thirds dies and no one makes stuff forward anymore then a You might be able to get it for cheap Especially if you're not a professional like.

175
00:12:39,557 --> 00:12:41,403
Rym: that's how I get a lot of audio equipment.

176
00:12:41,905 --> 00:12:43,510
Scott: It's still great, right?

177
00:12:44,432 --> 00:12:45,625
Scott: Nothing wrong with it, right?

178
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:50,288
Rym: If it dies dies, I'll go pick up a bunch of used lenses, right?

179
00:12:50,328 --> 00:12:51,721
Scott: Exactly You can get a whole bunch of stuff.

180
00:12:52,105 --> 00:13:05,179
Scott: or B You could sell your stuff to the people looking to pick up the cheap stuff Especially someone who's incorporated it into a professional workflow and doesn't want to have to change their pipeline or change Well, okay, so and then buy something else.

181
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:08,970
Scott: right you switch a different platform, but I think the professional you just mentioned, right?

182
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:17,456
Scott: That's the people where they sort of can't necessarily stick with it unless they have a ton of stuff because you can't get a repair You can't get a replacement.

183
00:13:17,476 --> 00:13:28,930
Rym: You can't get a warranty if this stuff is like, yeah I don't know how many of you have used professional camera equipment But it's getting support for it is really important because things break and weird stuff happen.

184
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,215
Rym: I with this face you're like.

185
00:13:30,255 --> 00:13:34,070
Scott: if you're like say a professional photographer you're doing like, you know magazine stuff, right?

186
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:34,592
Scott: And you're out.

187
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:35,960
Scott: you're out travel you're doing.

188
00:13:36,101 --> 00:13:39,956
Scott: you're traveling the world taking photos It's like and you're shooting on Olympus.

189
00:13:39,996 --> 00:13:41,781
Scott: this usually because you're like.

190
00:13:41,882 --> 00:13:44,730
Scott: Olympus is sponsoring and supporting you with stuff, right?

191
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:59,490
Scott: So it if anyone who is like one of those Olympus photographers now has to switch to something else Right, because even though they probably still have a bunch of gear and it will probably still work They can't be out on a shoot and need help and get boned, right?

192
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:02,030
Scott: They need to have a living company behind them.

193
00:14:02,211 --> 00:14:09,598
Rym: like you're one really really low light lens get stolen and now you're just screwed because there's literally no way to get another lens like That for your platform, right?

194
00:14:09,638 --> 00:14:12,269
Rym: Except for the one shady guy on eBay who has one for a lot of money.

195
00:14:13,891 --> 00:14:16,866
Scott: Yeah, and you do is the one he sends you gonna work a whole.

196
00:14:17,329 --> 00:14:19,769
Scott: so So that's a. that's a thing now.

197
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:24,170
Scott: So if you're buying camera if you're getting into a camera platform from nothing, right?

198
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,830
Scott: It's like, you know micro four-thirds is still great, right?

199
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:31,430
Scott: Are you gonna are you gonna spend a bunch of you know?

200
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:36,230
Scott: You could go and get it for way cheap from someone dumping it and you know get in on the the cheap.

201
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:39,244
Rym: I'm gonna keep an eye on on eBay because I could use a better zoom lens.

202
00:14:39,987 --> 00:14:44,849
Scott: Yeah, or You could you know get something else and avoid a dying.

203
00:14:47,755 --> 00:14:58,777
Rym: So in some other news Supreme Court Has a lot of rulings recently and I think historically they very rarely continued to issue more rulings into July Like they're doing more than usual.

204
00:14:58,817 --> 00:14:59,780
Scott: They're they're doing it.

205
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:05,492
Scott: You know, I guess I don't know if the how the the online Arguments of Affected.

206
00:15:05,692 --> 00:15:10,530
Rym: I saw like scones last night people just kind of freaking out about the fact that they issued more in July.

207
00:15:11,252 --> 00:15:16,470
Rym: No, but they actually did a ruling that I didn't know was the case cuz I wasn't paying attention.

208
00:15:17,032 --> 00:15:18,156
Scott: Supreme Court algy-related.

209
00:15:18,176 --> 00:15:28,130
Rym: Yep today a little while ago like right before we did the show upheld a 1991 law that bans robo calls to cell phones.

210
00:15:29,392 --> 00:15:35,099
Rym: Now you might be wondering but black dynamite I Get an infinite number of robo calls to my cell phone.

211
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:39,622
Rym: just because this is the law does not mean that anyone has been capable Of enforcing it at any point.

212
00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:43,842
Scott: Oh There's a law that you're not supposed to drive over X miles an hour on the road.

213
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:49,389
Scott: Yeah, like dynamite Everyone's driving crazy fast on the road and no one's getting in trouble for it.

214
00:15:49,693 --> 00:15:52,737
Rym: So yeah I've tried to figure out what the deal was with.

215
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:56,050
Rym: like what was the lawsuit around this that took until the year?

216
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,195
Rym: 2020 to resolve.

217
00:15:58,455 --> 00:16:14,169
Rym: so here's the deal basically in Congress made a bullshit exception to this law That allowed automated robo calls to any phone number, even if it's a cell phone for the purposes of collection of government debt.

218
00:16:15,492 --> 00:16:16,600
Scott: Mm-hmm, like.

219
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,170
Rym: that's an oddly specific loophole.

220
00:16:18,893 --> 00:16:23,249
Scott: I think that's you know, as long as the government is the one doing the collection, right?

221
00:16:23,893 --> 00:16:25,931
Scott: You know like you are mine He's.

222
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:28,338
Rym: so part of the ruling actually addressed that as well.

223
00:16:28,438 --> 00:16:39,450
Rym: quote six justices agreed that by allowing debt collection calls to cell phones Congress quote impermissibly favored debt collection speech over political and other speech in violation of the First Amendment.

224
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:46,326
Scott: interesting because I was thinking each I See, but the way I would think of it is like what you're collecting.

225
00:16:46,366 --> 00:16:48,816
Scott: government debt Right is like it would be.

226
00:16:49,137 --> 00:16:52,730
Scott: the actual government is making the call right not some debt collector?

227
00:16:53,573 --> 00:16:58,670
Rym: No, but if a debt collector owns government debt like a student loan, yeah, see that's bullshit, right?

228
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,597
Scott: That shouldn't even be allowed to happen, right?

229
00:17:00,637 --> 00:17:04,010
Scott: It shouldn't be legal for a non the non government to hold government.

230
00:17:04,412 --> 00:17:07,788
Scott: It should be like the IRS is calling you because you owe back taxes, right?

231
00:17:07,887 --> 00:17:09,469
Scott: It's like yeah They should be able to call yourself.

232
00:17:10,212 --> 00:17:17,290
Rym: So if that's the only way to contact you, so basically the lawsuit was a bunch of political consultants and pollsters.

233
00:17:17,931 --> 00:17:23,204
Rym: We're trying to get the entire law struck down because they want to make robocalls to cell phones.

234
00:17:23,265 --> 00:17:32,510
Scott: for a million reasons, of course Yeah, because they're the only ones right because the ban right is ineffectively banning robocalls from shady people.

235
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,600
Scott: Yeah, right, but they are acting.

236
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,530
Scott: they're legitimate organizations, right?

237
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:39,930
Scott: They're political pollsters in the US right there, right?

238
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:44,470
Scott: And so the law actually does stop them from giving you robocalls, right?

239
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:46,837
Scott: It's the people who are successfully making robocalls.

240
00:17:47,198 --> 00:17:51,030
Scott: are people outside the law legal framework of the United States, right?

241
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:58,648
Rym: So basically from what I can gather the issue was whether or not Congress could allow some speech but not other speech.

242
00:17:58,668 --> 00:18:03,210
Rym: and If they can't make those kinds of distinctions that the whole law should be unconstitutional.

243
00:18:03,932 --> 00:18:09,150
Scott: But yeah, I think it's clear that it can't if it can't be based on the content of the call.

244
00:18:09,792 --> 00:18:12,663
Rym: Yeah, so it looks like I haven't read the.

245
00:18:12,684 --> 00:18:14,310
Rym: this like just is kind of breaking news.

246
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:20,060
Rym: I haven't read the opinion yet, but it looks like this backfired on them and the Supreme Court actually even got rid of that 2015 exception.

247
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:25,715
Rym: Okay There's a money quote here America from the decision.

248
00:18:25,775 --> 00:18:31,270
Rym: Americans passionately disagree about many things, but they are largely United in their disdain for robocalls.

249
00:18:33,714 --> 00:18:34,202
Scott: That's true.

250
00:18:37,931 --> 00:18:43,230
Rym: During arguments in the case Justice Stephen Breyer got a cut off when someone tried calling him.

251
00:18:44,052 --> 00:18:51,138
Rym: He said after he rejoined the court's arguments quote the telephone started to ring and it cut me off the call but I don't think it was a robocall.

252
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:57,962
Rym: so I think I think the Online arguments are not going super well based on that statement.

253
00:18:58,323 --> 00:18:59,807
Rym: I feel like they're getting interrupted into.

254
00:18:59,948 --> 00:19:00,329
Scott: I'm curious.

255
00:19:00,951 --> 00:19:04,929
Scott: I know we have some international listener out there at least one, right?

256
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:11,050
Scott: Are there robocalls a problem in other countries right as they are in the u.s.

257
00:19:11,794 --> 00:19:11,955
Rym: Like?

258
00:19:11,975 --> 00:19:14,569
Rym: this is the broader point why I brought up this news in the u.s.

259
00:19:15,091 --> 00:19:19,670
Rym: Robocalls are bad enough to where the idea of a phone number is just fucked.

260
00:19:20,031 --> 00:19:23,749
Rym: Most people don't answer their phone when it rings at all or if they have put it.

261
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:27,227
Scott: There is a setting on my iPhone and everyone should be aware of this setting it.

262
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:34,990
Scott: My iPhone is set to automatically not ring if the phone number that is calling is not in my contacts.

263
00:19:35,191 --> 00:19:43,510
Scott: Yep, there's a similar Android setting and if somebody wants to call me And it's a legit call they should be leaving a voicemail, right?

264
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:49,938
Scott: So sometimes it's pretty rare that a robocall leaves a voicemail, but it happens occasionally Yeah, right, and I just delete it.

265
00:19:49,978 --> 00:19:50,500
Scott: no big deal.

266
00:19:50,641 --> 00:19:52,330
Scott: And I know it doesn't interrupt me or bother me.

267
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:57,910
Scott: It happens super rarely right and I have an app that I you know, there's various apps out there.

268
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:58,957
Scott: I don't know which ones are better.

269
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:00,710
Scott: So I don't recommend one or over the other.

270
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:05,510
Scott: But I picked an app from the App Store that blocks many robocalls.

271
00:20:06,217 --> 00:20:07,067
Scott: So that helps also.

272
00:20:07,976 --> 00:20:25,564
Rym: but the broader point here is that Because like look there's a Supreme Court case about they had to pass a law to block spam in the United States on phones because of the very heavy restrictions and Regulations around the telephone network because it was invented a long time ago.

273
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:27,290
Rym: There's a lot of regulation around it.

274
00:20:27,551 --> 00:20:49,527
Rym: it is used very differently today from how it was used back then, but basically By because of all these restrictions on the ability to restrict phone calls No one like Verizon or Sprint or anyone who runs the cell network could probably just block these robocalls automatically today by flipping a switch like that would be trivial just like spam blockers,

275
00:20:49,969 --> 00:20:50,190
Scott: but

276
00:20:50,891 --> 00:20:55,923
Rym: Generally, and I'm not getting into specifics There's a lot of laws and regulations that say phone calls have to get through.

277
00:20:56,003 --> 00:21:05,390
Rym: you can't arbitrarily block phone calls Even though most people would gladly let someone arbitrary block arbitrarily block phone calls to them to avoid these robocalls.

278
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:10,324
Rym: The only reason people use email today is because there's no such regulation.

279
00:21:10,585 --> 00:21:24,030
Rym: It's not illegal to block spam So everyone blocks spam, but it's effectively illegal to block robocalls Thus making phones completely worthless as a means of contacting someone who you have not already contacted.

280
00:21:24,594 --> 00:21:34,187
Rym: The reason this is an even weirder problem now Is that Phone calls from numbers you don't recognize are one of the primary means of doing contact tracing for COVID.

281
00:21:34,728 --> 00:21:43,390
Rym: and it turns out I read a separate article Nobody answers their phones when the government calls and nobody even listens to the voicemails when the government calls.

282
00:21:43,731 --> 00:21:51,885
Rym: So contact tracing is not working that well because people are trained to know that anytime their phone rings and they don't know the number It's spam and they don't answer it.

283
00:21:53,551 --> 00:21:58,130
Rym: There's no way to solve this without radically restructuring how telephone numbers are regulated.

284
00:21:58,632 --> 00:22:00,136
Scott: You could just stop robocalls.

285
00:22:00,337 --> 00:22:08,870
Scott: if they blocked all robocalls at the variety at the telco level I think it would only take a matter of months for people to regain trust in phone.

286
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:09,574
Rym: I think so, too.

287
00:22:10,459 --> 00:22:10,922
Scott: I think it would.

288
00:22:10,982 --> 00:22:12,330
Scott: it would take like no time at all, right?

289
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:20,350
Rym: It's like we have a society to one accept false positives Like occasionally a call would get blocked that you want it just like we do with email.

290
00:22:20,611 --> 00:22:26,330
Scott: I think it would be pretty rare because almost all of the illegal robocalls are coming from outside the country.

291
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,777
Scott: Yeah from a few sources.

292
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:29,064
Rym: Ah, but they look so yeah.

293
00:22:29,144 --> 00:22:30,149
Rym: Yeah, right.

294
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,033
Scott: So what I think?

295
00:22:31,174 --> 00:22:39,710
Scott: I think the way it would sort of work is like you would report a robocall To like Verizon would see like a flurry of calls coming in and like a few would get through and then they block.

296
00:22:39,976 --> 00:22:46,730
Rym: Yep, right Like if one source calls multiple phone numbers in the same area code in a short span of time that gets flagged for review automatically

297
00:22:47,571 --> 00:22:47,732
Scott: Mm-hmm,

298
00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:48,535
Rym: but

299
00:22:48,936 --> 00:22:54,381
Scott: or like you would you would get it you would get a call and it would be a scam and you'd report it And then they'd fit.

300
00:22:54,401 --> 00:23:01,070
Scott: they'd look in the logs Figure out exactly where that came from and then close off that route and that person would lose phone service to the u.s.

301
00:23:01,311 --> 00:23:04,430
Scott: Yeah, right from wherever they are or it would be certain.

302
00:23:04,912 --> 00:23:06,116
Scott: The problem is you would get into.

303
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:19,573
Scott: issues were like, let's say there's like a phone carrier right and say I don't know pick a country country X right and that carrier, you know There's like a neighborhood and in the neighborhood There's a bunch of grandma's Right and one

304
00:23:19,593 --> 00:23:20,577
Rym: robocall scammer

305
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:24,110
Scott: and one robocall as a little office with some scammers in it, right?

306
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:27,450
Scott: And they're all on the same phone, you know network thing, right?

307
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:38,030
Scott: but we already accept the risk of what you just described for all of the All of the grandchildren of those grandmas who immigrated to the United States wouldn't would have a problem with grandma calling them.

308
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,777
Rym: But we already have that today with email.

309
00:23:40,078 --> 00:23:46,948
Rym: if you if your email provider is using IPs that are adjacent to dodgy IPS your emails don't go anywhere.

310
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:49,600
Rym: We already accept that.

311
00:23:49,963 --> 00:23:50,265
Scott: I guess.

312
00:23:50,326 --> 00:23:50,930
Scott: I guess that's true.

313
00:23:51,311 --> 00:23:57,150
Scott: I mean in the old days before there was AI driven grandma's using the shady ISP that the spammers use for her email.

314
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:59,699
Scott: You're not gonna get grandma's email in the days before.

315
00:23:59,719 --> 00:24:02,710
Scott: the problem is is that grandma can choose a different email provider.

316
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:03,795
Scott: Grandma can get a Gmail.

317
00:24:04,016 --> 00:24:09,656
Scott: Yeah, grandma can't change the phone company in country X. Yeah, but grandma well companies just where you live.

318
00:24:09,696 --> 00:24:16,850
Rym: but grandma might be banned from editing with Wikipedia forever because grandma only has two ISP options both of which are blocked by Wikipedia.

319
00:24:18,297 --> 00:24:27,710
Rym: Could be yeah I remember in the RIT days I would like when I ran an email server like I blocked Any email that came from an IP address outside of the United States at one point to try to stop spam?

320
00:24:31,992 --> 00:24:37,110
Scott: Yeah, I think the government could also like eminent domain Google's anti-spam technology.

321
00:24:39,587 --> 00:24:44,890
Scott: and You know you know you wouldn't even have to force a company like Google to like make anti-spam for phones.

322
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:47,339
Scott: You could just make a government contract to do it.

323
00:24:47,379 --> 00:24:50,390
Rym: Yeah, they happily would fall over their selves themselves bidding on that.

324
00:24:51,052 --> 00:24:55,005
Scott: Yeah, you could just be like hey who wants the government's putting up bids for the the?

325
00:24:55,025 --> 00:24:56,390
Scott: you know the u.s.

326
00:24:56,850 --> 00:25:02,848
Scott: anti-phone spam blocking software That will be applied to all incoming phone calls.

327
00:25:04,115 --> 00:25:04,765
Scott: Who wants to build it?

328
00:25:06,077 --> 00:25:11,600
Rym: One billion dollar but anyway things of the day.

329
00:25:12,042 --> 00:25:15,540
Rym: So I did not know the thing I'm about to talk about.

330
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,510
Rym: This is the kind of thing that I feel like I should have known.

331
00:25:17,611 --> 00:25:19,279
Rym: I feel dumb for having not known it.

332
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:27,849
Rym: Basically you ever notice how when you get a deck of playing cards like a standard deck 52 cards The ace of spades is always fancier than all the other cards.

333
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:32,502
Rym: like the design on it is usually a lot fancier than the other Suit.

334
00:25:32,903 --> 00:25:34,710
Scott: yeah, I mean, it's just sort of like.

335
00:25:34,911 --> 00:25:37,100
Scott: it's sort of like a just an accepted truth.

336
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:41,072
Scott: It's like yeah, the ace of spades is the awesome card ace of spades.

337
00:25:41,312 --> 00:25:41,453
Scott: right?

338
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:41,573
Scott: this?

339
00:25:41,613 --> 00:25:43,800
Scott: you know the songs ace of spades?

340
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,188
Scott: Yeah, right.

341
00:25:45,289 --> 00:25:46,315
Scott: It's like it just is.

342
00:25:46,737 --> 00:25:52,980
Scott: so Cuz I know I'd not until just now I just sort of accepted it as a truth of the universe.

343
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,335
Rym: Yeah, I saw this tweet and my brain said why didn't you ever ask this question?

344
00:25:57,596 --> 00:25:58,438
Rym: you dumb piece of shit?

345
00:25:59,563 --> 00:26:01,493
Rym: Is the kind of thing you would want to know about this?

346
00:26:01,513 --> 00:26:02,799
Scott: is the guy really want to know now?

347
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,886
Rym: Yeah, so the answer is actually really good.

348
00:26:04,926 --> 00:26:06,391
Rym: This is a Twitter thread that explains it all.

349
00:26:06,652 --> 00:26:15,236
Rym: the answer involves King James the second Goddamnit And the English text system and also a specific breed of chicken.

350
00:26:15,537 --> 00:26:21,370
Rym: I'm not joking So the short answer is and you could read this thread to get all the details.

351
00:26:21,731 --> 00:26:24,639
Rym: is that in England in the 1600s?

352
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:31,000
Rym: Mm-hmm King James the second introduced a tax on playing cards.

353
00:26:31,843 --> 00:26:34,454
Scott: Yeah, there's been a tax on playing cards even in the US today.

354
00:26:34,474 --> 00:26:46,480
Rym: There's a little sticker on playing cards Yep, so in order to basically Up to that point there were rules requiring anyone making playing cards to put their printers logo on the cards in the deck.

355
00:26:46,921 --> 00:26:51,234
Rym: So people would know who printed those cards to help in the tax investigations.

356
00:26:51,836 --> 00:26:52,197
Rym: Mm-hmm.

357
00:26:52,218 --> 00:27:03,620
Rym: So later in 1765 the English tax office introduced to be able to make better compliance with these taxes a Standard design for the ace of spades the duty ace.

358
00:27:04,101 --> 00:27:10,780
Rym: So every deck of cards the ace of spades was the receipt that you had paid the taxes and had a really complicated design.

359
00:27:11,101 --> 00:27:18,743
Rym: That would have been hard to forge and everyone who was authorized to make trading cards had like the die to print this Standard.

360
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:23,740
Scott: I say so if you were if you were if the at the printing at the printing company where they were making cards.

361
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:29,337
Scott: Yeah, if you dutifully paid your taxes, the government would give you this thing to let you print.

362
00:27:29,437 --> 00:27:37,979
Scott: aces of spades Yep, and and every few days you are not paying if you're not paying your taxes They would take that away from you or change it for everyone else.

363
00:27:38,249 --> 00:27:42,740
Scott: Yeah So your ace of spades is and you're playing cards would look man and they'd know that that was an illegal.

364
00:27:43,082 --> 00:27:57,256
Rym: Yeah, if you were caught with the deck of cards that didn't have the duty a city What if I just had an old Aztec from pre-tax, I don't know the details of 1765 era English law unfortunately, but the thread actually links to a bunch of references.

365
00:27:57,336 --> 00:27:58,640
Rym: I think we can answer that question.

366
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:07,302
Rym: So over time they kept making that design more and more complex to make it hard to counterfeit because people got really good at counterfeiting The ace of spades.

367
00:28:07,744 --> 00:28:08,426
Scott: Yeah, of course.

368
00:28:08,747 --> 00:28:28,640
Rym: So they started doing something that today we would probably call more like Baroque Like I made a Baroque design but in the 1800s for Reasons related to those chickens and maybe to a certain Women's hairstyle of the day they called that ridiculous ornamentation that was hard to counterfeit.

369
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:33,070
Rym: Frizzling they said that it would that the design was frizzled mm-hmm.

370
00:28:34,283 --> 00:28:36,330
Rym: That ties into a woman's hairstyle.

371
00:28:36,672 --> 00:28:43,080
Rym: and then a particular kind of chicken That was called frizzled because they had the Polish frizzle feather.

372
00:28:44,301 --> 00:28:48,840
Rym: The frizzle feather chicken kind of looked like the design the standard design for the ace of spades.

373
00:28:49,563 --> 00:28:57,130
Rym: Once the laws were updated to where they relaxed it and you were no longer required to do the duty ace They came up with modern stuff like that little thing you see on a bicycle deck today.

374
00:28:58,481 --> 00:29:08,920
Rym: People just kept making fancy ace of spades because they had been throughout all of history and many of the card makers Included bird wings and or that frizzled chicken in reference to the frizzling.

375
00:29:09,841 --> 00:29:14,020
Rym: Okay, that's why you'll often see a cock on the ace of spades in a fancy deck of cards.

376
00:29:14,481 --> 00:29:16,067
Scott: Oh, I've seen cocks on the ace of spades before.

377
00:29:16,268 --> 00:29:18,877
Rym: so if this actually answered a lot of vague questions.

378
00:29:18,897 --> 00:29:22,566
Scott: I had never asked Yeah, that sounds great.

379
00:29:22,706 --> 00:29:29,510
Scott: Yeah, somebody got so when I was in college learning The basics of logic and computer science.

380
00:29:29,571 --> 00:29:34,450
Scott: there was a little like free software kind of program They they had a download link for.

381
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:35,715
Scott: I think ran on.

382
00:29:35,876 --> 00:29:36,900
Scott: I think was like a Java app.

383
00:29:37,061 --> 00:29:49,412
Scott: I think someone might even written at the school I don't know, but it was like a little GUI that would let you you know basically virtually build electronic logic circuits with gates and flip-flops and clocks.

384
00:29:49,493 --> 00:29:51,820
Scott: and you know voltage ground light bulb.

385
00:29:52,263 --> 00:29:54,619
Scott: You know little LCD displays with numbers on them.

386
00:29:55,001 --> 00:30:01,280
Scott: You know all the basic circuitry without having to get out your breadboard or your soldering iron or any of that bullshit, right?

387
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:06,233
Scott: You could just do it right on your screen with your mouse and keyboard because I you know Even though I went to school 20 years ago.

388
00:30:06,253 --> 00:30:11,880
Scott: It wasn't Right And it saves the school a lot of money.

389
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:16,880
Scott: You don't have to buy have a whole electronics lab full of you know all these supplying all the students with gates and everything.

390
00:30:17,142 --> 00:30:19,538
Scott: You know, it's like everyone can just do it home all they want, right?

391
00:30:21,381 --> 00:30:27,080
Scott: So, you know, I haven't seen an app like that like around practice haven't looked for one.

392
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:33,254
Scott: I'm sure there's plenty to choose from But I discovered this one recently, I don't know how old it is.

393
00:30:33,294 --> 00:30:35,463
Scott: it might be around for a while But it's new to me.

394
00:30:35,483 --> 00:30:38,031
Scott: It's a website called logic dot Lee.

395
00:30:38,352 --> 00:30:41,020
Scott: logically, but the dot goes after the C, right?

396
00:30:42,102 --> 00:30:43,189
Scott: And their app cost $60.

397
00:30:43,189 --> 00:30:46,826
Scott: It is not free But they have a free demo.

398
00:30:46,906 --> 00:30:49,655
Scott: you just logically dot logic dot Lee slash demo.

399
00:30:50,036 --> 00:30:57,880
Scott: that lets you use the app In some limited extent for free, but it even though it is a very limited extent it runs in a browser.

400
00:30:58,303 --> 00:30:59,190
Scott: It runs beautifully.

401
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:03,122
Scott: It looks like a desktop app and It's.

402
00:31:03,303 --> 00:31:16,730
Scott: I really don't see why you need more features than what I see in this demo if your purpose is to learn The basics of electronic logic right which is all you would really want to do with this I see.

403
00:31:16,751 --> 00:31:25,280
Scott: if your flip-flops Yeah So yeah, I mean you you know, it's like even if you just need a refresher on like how the different kinds of flip-flops work.

404
00:31:25,401 --> 00:31:37,820
Scott: It's like you could just pull one out and mess around with it and be like oh, yeah That's how it works right hook up some light bulbs to the outputs And you know hook up some clocks and switches and power to the inputs, and you'll you know you figure it out, right?

405
00:31:38,340 --> 00:32:02,652
Scott: So yeah, if you you know and also, I guess if you're a student Getting started you know in the computer science land right or electronic engineering land or anything like that if Your school did not teach this to you, or it's maybe recommending some other app this app might be Worth it to you, and you know if you're really doing a lot of this kind of stuff You know maybe the $60 might even be worth it.

406
00:32:02,733 --> 00:32:06,755
Scott: if you're like actually designing circuits You know for some projects or something right?

407
00:32:07,218 --> 00:32:07,359
Rym: Yeah?

408
00:32:07,821 --> 00:32:12,860
Rym: I did looks like actually I like the simulation option that it just it traces the path of all the logic.

409
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,389
Scott: Yeah, it's way better than the app that we had in.

410
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:19,800
Scott: oh yeah, and it's in a web, and it's in a web browser.

411
00:32:21,344 --> 00:32:22,160
Scott: So there you go.

412
00:32:22,381 --> 00:32:24,792
Scott: I just thought it was really cool, and I think it is really.

413
00:32:24,873 --> 00:32:29,230
Scott: if anyone knows there's a better one Let me know cuz you know, but does it there?

414
00:32:29,251 --> 00:32:31,800
Scott: my I imagine there's probably better ones that run on the desktop.

415
00:32:31,961 --> 00:32:34,815
Scott: I don't know if there's better ones that are in a browser.

416
00:32:35,076 --> 00:32:46,883
Rym: right yeah This reminds me a lot of a very similar app I use in like inside of Atlassian confluence to draw like flow diagrams like almost the exact same user Interface.

417
00:32:47,525 --> 00:32:48,690
Scott: oh like yeah, but that's just.

418
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:50,155
Scott: those are just just something like.

419
00:32:50,175 --> 00:32:51,320
Scott: yeah, it doesn't simulate.

420
00:32:52,801 --> 00:32:55,969
Scott: Yeah, this is actually you know simulating the electricity.

421
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,473
Scott: right you're making the actual circuit.

422
00:32:58,115 --> 00:32:58,958
Rym: Yeah, this is cool stuff.

423
00:32:59,339 --> 00:33:01,614
Rym: all right in the moment We're just hanging out in quarantine.

424
00:33:01,876 --> 00:33:02,300
Rym: stay tuned.

425
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:07,670
Rym: We're gonna be appearing at a bunch of online conventions And we're as many as we can work our way into.

426
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:08,433
Scott: we'll figure it out.

427
00:33:08,774 --> 00:33:10,299
Scott: Yeah, I guess we'll do.

428
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:11,773
Scott: Pat We'll figure write some panels.

429
00:33:11,793 --> 00:33:12,218
Scott: I don't know.

430
00:33:12,258 --> 00:33:13,083
Rym: yeah I got.

431
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:15,859
Rym: we got to put in the rest of the packs online ones at least I got to put in the new one.

432
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,024
Rym: you and I were talking about it.

433
00:33:17,225 --> 00:33:19,634
Scott: the packs online panel submissions are live.

434
00:33:19,714 --> 00:33:25,476
Scott: so if you're out there and You have never ever done a panel out of packs.

435
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:27,885
Scott: Maybe you live somewhere You don't have enough money or whatever.

436
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:29,611
Scott: you don't have the means to go to a packs.

437
00:33:30,072 --> 00:33:30,373
Scott: right.

438
00:33:30,774 --> 00:33:33,328
Scott: you have any panel idea whatsoever Right?

439
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:37,628
Scott: I highly recommend Submitting a panel submission to packs online.

440
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:39,073
Scott: Yeah, you have nothing to lose.

441
00:33:39,213 --> 00:33:40,958
Scott: There's no penalty for getting rejected.

442
00:33:40,998 --> 00:33:45,735
Rym: Yeah, worst case They say sorry we can't fit you in this year cost nothing to submit right.

443
00:33:45,756 --> 00:34:05,960
Scott: so submit B. There's gonna be a lot of acceptances because packs online is gonna be so many days long right That they're going to need content to fill it up, so I'm willing to bet I don't have confirmation of this But I'm willing to bet that Content that would not be accepted at an actual in-person packs where time and space are more limited.

444
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:10,907
Scott: Yeah, we'll be more likely to be accepted to packs online Like we're submitting like.

445
00:34:11,168 --> 00:34:21,239
Rym: so you know we're submitting our normal kind of stuff But we're gonna submit some weird or like some forward-thinking types of panels that we normally wouldn't even bother trying to submit to packs right.

446
00:34:22,261 --> 00:34:26,074
Scott: And lastly it could be you know your chance to like get out there right?

447
00:34:26,155 --> 00:34:27,058
Scott: so you know.

448
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:33,320
Scott: maybe You you know you're not someone like us who's like a media podcast II person who's got like a thing to say.

449
00:34:33,521 --> 00:34:36,760
Scott: Maybe you're just making maybe you made a tiny little indie game, right?

450
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:39,119
Rym: It's like do a panel and promote it.

451
00:34:39,281 --> 00:34:41,203
Scott: You can get free promotion Just you know.

452
00:34:41,583 --> 00:34:45,862
Scott: find some way to spin it to make it look like your panels not just an advertisement for your little indie Game.

453
00:34:46,445 --> 00:34:48,800
Scott: right and go out there, right?

454
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,143
Scott: Make it happen.

455
00:34:51,185 --> 00:35:03,296
Rym: Yeah, if you're passionate about a title like a genre of you like saying you play 18xx games And that's your whole life I'll bet a panel just explaining what the deal is with those and like walking through like the history of them would probably I would Go to a panel like that.

456
00:35:04,003 --> 00:35:06,620
Scott: Yeah, it's like I've played enough 18xx that I could do that panel.

457
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:12,080
Scott: But there's people who are way deep in 18xx is their only thing in life, and they are the ones who should do that panel.

458
00:35:12,241 --> 00:35:16,700
Rym: Yeah, we will focus on the panels where we actually have some expertise right?

459
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:20,599
Scott: It's like there's a lot that I could do, but I want you know there's only some that I should do.

460
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:24,553
Scott: So it's like think about what you should do right.

461
00:35:24,734 --> 00:35:27,182
Scott: because guess what you can yep and you know.

462
00:35:27,382 --> 00:35:41,124
Rym: even if like I know some people who have submitted panels to packs for like a People who read those submissions at packs and other kinds like it like they notice a lot of times you might be surprised They'll see.

463
00:35:41,165 --> 00:35:42,740
Rym: felt like I used to run a panels department.

464
00:35:42,842 --> 00:35:46,934
Rym: I'd look through submissions And I'd see panel ideas that I thought were cool that I couldn't fit in.

465
00:35:47,396 --> 00:35:52,617
Rym: but over the years I'd see like oh that same person keeps submitting that idea that I think is cool that I can't fit in.

466
00:35:52,858 --> 00:35:54,223
Rym: and one year I was like you know what fuck it.

467
00:35:54,243 --> 00:35:59,180
Rym: I'm gonna make room for that dude who submitted this panel on mushing for like five years.

468
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,427
Rym: I'm gonna put it in the schedule.

469
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:01,613
Scott: so the panel.

470
00:36:01,794 --> 00:36:03,464
Scott: not enough people went to it But I went to it.

471
00:36:03,504 --> 00:36:04,269
Scott: that panel was good.

472
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:06,040
Rym: Yeah that I wish I could have gone to it.

473
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:06,463
Rym: I was busy.

474
00:36:06,563 --> 00:36:07,851
Scott: a lot of dog pics.

475
00:36:08,214 --> 00:36:13,254
Rym: if I recall correctly I was sidelined dealing with a convention crisis during that panel.

476
00:36:13,877 --> 00:36:14,358
Scott: dumb dumb dumb.

477
00:36:15,362 --> 00:36:24,580
Rym: But convention crisis on the scale of real-life crisis is the equivalent of someone spilled some water like it's not Kids crying because Markiplier is not here whatever.

478
00:36:25,661 --> 00:36:28,188
Rym: All right, yeah, otherwise YouTube discord all that stuff.

479
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:28,829
Rym: Let's get into it.

480
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:43,100
Rym: There is a lot of technology that oh yeah people assume based on nothing is Obsolete, but in fact is widely used and not only not obsolete, but still like very important, right?

481
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:46,354
Scott: So I'm you know I thought of this because I was thinking about the earlier picture.

482
00:36:46,374 --> 00:36:48,664
Rym: I put up on the screen is MIDI Right.

483
00:36:48,968 --> 00:36:57,928
Scott: yeah the earlier news I thought about you know cuz like you know with the micro four-thirds dying right and it now it's like sort of obsolete But also it's like hey actually this that stuff.

484
00:36:57,988 --> 00:37:10,863
Scott: It still totally works right and it's totally still useful But there's nothing wrong with it right and I look around and it's like actually you know it's like some technology is truly Obsolete like there is.

485
00:37:11,124 --> 00:37:14,754
Scott: you know it had its time and it is just worse right.

486
00:37:14,974 --> 00:37:17,120
Scott: for example the five and a quarter floppy drive.

487
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,746
Scott: Right it is just worse.

488
00:37:19,147 --> 00:37:23,682
Scott: Yeah, and any other kind of storage the movable removable store I know.

489
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:27,173
Rym: second a three and a quarter inch floppy appear.

490
00:37:27,193 --> 00:37:32,169
Rym: three and a half three and a half five and a quarter three and Not that that knowledge matters anymore.

491
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:33,273
Scott: It doesn't matter.

492
00:37:33,634 --> 00:37:35,480
Rym: That's how I was that there was my dumb mnemonic.

493
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,812
Rym: I always remembered five and a quarter three and a half and I met.

494
00:37:38,912 --> 00:37:50,700
Scott: only purpose today of a five and a quarter drive and disk is to Operate if just for historical museum curation preservation purposes, right?

495
00:37:51,961 --> 00:37:59,159
Scott: For places that still have old hardware being used yeah that could be could and should be replaced But for some reason they just haven't upgraded yet.

496
00:37:59,942 --> 00:38:01,490
Rym: Yeah, but but it's what.

497
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:02,395
Rym: that's the difference.

498
00:38:02,415 --> 00:38:08,375
Rym: or something that is Obsolete, but is still being used as opposed to something that is not actually obsolete.

499
00:38:08,395 --> 00:38:10,160
Rym: You just think it's obsolete, right?

500
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:20,210
Scott: So something that you think is obsolete, but is not actually obsolete for example the CRT Tube right yeah, so it's like okay.

501
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:24,240
Scott: You know LCD screens are pretty much mostly just better.

502
00:38:24,361 --> 00:38:27,600
Scott: Why would you still want a tube right television?

503
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,468
Rym: Do you need an extremely high refresh rate for some reason?

504
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:38,149
Scott: right so they are making LCDs these days with extremely high refresh rates Right, but this they still have.

505
00:38:38,189 --> 00:38:38,891
Scott: this sort of like.

506
00:38:39,152 --> 00:38:46,268
Scott: you know small amount of lag that goes on right and The amount of lag that you get.

507
00:38:46,649 --> 00:38:50,826
Scott: you know if you got like a GameCube, but you want to play smash melee It's like you need a CRT.

508
00:38:50,846 --> 00:38:54,740
Scott: You can't just can't even on an LCD with like no pre-processing bullshit.

509
00:38:55,322 --> 00:38:55,683
Scott: It's like.

510
00:38:56,025 --> 00:39:01,775
Scott: it is noticeably significant to the point where people who aren't crazy can tell No, that's what I would say.

511
00:39:01,816 --> 00:39:07,240
Rym: the reason It's not obsolete even though that might sound very similar to the example where you said something is obsolete like a museum.

512
00:39:07,661 --> 00:39:22,468
Rym: I think the difference is people there is a current need to actively play these games and non CRT technology cannot Completely 100% handle that use case Mm-hmm once they're in.

513
00:39:22,548 --> 00:39:28,567
Rym: if they the future there's a plasma display or an LCD that is 100% as good as the CRT for that use case.

514
00:39:28,848 --> 00:39:31,696
Rym: that nanosecond CRTs are now obsolete in that realm forever.

515
00:39:32,458 --> 00:39:35,926
Scott: Yep Another thing related.

516
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:37,552
Scott: right it's like analog film right.

517
00:39:37,572 --> 00:39:38,937
Scott: it's like you think oh analog film.

518
00:39:38,957 --> 00:39:39,740
Scott: Why would you use that?

519
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,231
Scott: It's just worse right except actually it's not just worse.

520
00:39:43,271 --> 00:39:50,294
Scott: the resolution on analog film is actually insane Right compared to the resolution of even the best digital cameras around.

521
00:39:50,375 --> 00:40:00,465
Scott: obviously if you get like a digital Medium format camera the resolution is so insane that you're not going to improve on that with analog right, but actually cost wise Right.

522
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:14,137
Scott: so to get a full-frame Camera, you know with a really high resolution sensor costs many thousands of dollars You can go to the drugstore and still buy a disposable 35 millimeter film camera.

523
00:40:14,257 --> 00:40:21,325
Scott: Yeah, and That has the same size sensor as like a you know Nikon d4.

524
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:24,594
Rym: we don't want to derail the show by talking about film grain and how they're right.

525
00:40:24,634 --> 00:40:26,359
Rym: ultimately a resolution on like.

526
00:40:26,419 --> 00:40:26,740
Rym: it's not.

527
00:40:27,144 --> 00:40:28,740
Scott: There is ultimately a resolution.

528
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:41,240
Scott: But the point is you know the the even though the power of it has been you know of analog film has been obsoleted by Digital cameras, it's so much cheaper, right?

529
00:40:42,062 --> 00:40:53,620
Rym: Well like regular old cassette tapes were not as obsolete by better technology existing because they were still a like accessible means of accessing audio recording technology to consumers.

530
00:40:54,423 --> 00:41:02,126
Rym: Mm-hmm like when other came out because that's we're not obsolete because I couldn't record to a CD Cassette tape was the only way I could record anything.

531
00:41:02,146 --> 00:41:08,803
Rym: because that's we're not obsolete until well well into the CD our era Correct.

532
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:15,626
Rym: and this is a nuance that a lot of people who aren't close to specific technologies Really like lose track of.

533
00:41:15,666 --> 00:41:30,520
Rym: like it amazes me how many people even like people who are our age This isn't like an old young thing who just assume tech they haven't seen in a while is obsolete Especially when it comes to things like development frameworks Like yeah Java Web Start that sucks, right?

534
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:37,060
Rym: There are still cases where Java Web Start or the successors of Java Web Start make sense.

535
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,229
Rym: They're not obsolete yet.

536
00:41:38,551 --> 00:41:41,201
Rym: They're just not preferred Mm-hmm.

537
00:41:42,104 --> 00:41:42,706
Scott: Yeah, there's all.

538
00:41:42,726 --> 00:41:44,912
Scott: if you're not about software that's not obsolete.

539
00:41:45,354 --> 00:41:46,276
Scott: Oh boy, right?

540
00:41:46,297 --> 00:41:47,480
Scott: There's there's tons, right?

541
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,728
Scott: It's like there's weird image formats.

542
00:41:49,808 --> 00:41:52,699
Scott: Like, you know that it's like oh you think oh, we'll just use JPEGs.

543
00:41:52,759 --> 00:41:53,221
Scott: now I have.

544
00:41:53,342 --> 00:41:55,940
Scott: it's like what do we need these other, you know image confirm?

545
00:41:56,060 --> 00:42:00,159
Scott: It's like no, there's still a time and a place for for a bitmap for a tiff.

546
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:10,429
Rym: Yeah, you know it's like all these old things or all these video codecs and formats like another thing we can't get deep into but There are video.

547
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:18,139
Rym: when you think most people when they think of video codecs What they're actually thinking of is the container format and inside of that container are audio and video like codecs.

548
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,213
Rym: I'm really oversimplifying here.

549
00:42:20,233 --> 00:42:26,097
Rym: a Huge variety of those exist and a lot of them are in wide use for a lot of reasons.

550
00:42:26,358 --> 00:42:33,620
Rym: some things are Extremely low CPU usage like they don't need a lot of power to decode but they're very large instead.

551
00:42:33,741 --> 00:42:34,995
Rym: Like there's a lot of trade-offs there.

552
00:42:36,502 --> 00:42:37,867
Rym: Or like your your film camera example.

553
00:42:37,887 --> 00:42:43,900
Rym: another example of where you might want a film camera or where there's a use case for them Is the requirement to photograph?

554
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:49,212
Rym: Phenomena in a place that has an extreme amount of electromagnetic radiation.

555
00:42:49,452 --> 00:42:51,999
Rym: that would prevent a modern digital camera from functioning.

556
00:42:52,882 --> 00:42:58,820
Rym: Mmm, but a physical camera with only physical mechanisms and film could take photographs in such an environment?

557
00:42:59,781 --> 00:43:00,443
Scott: Yeah, sure.

558
00:43:00,544 --> 00:43:01,025
Scott: Absolutely.

559
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:03,974
Rym: Yeah, but what I run into the most that I think is the funniest.

560
00:43:04,094 --> 00:43:10,416
Rym: and even in high school I ran into people who tried to tell me that MIDI was obsolete like MIDI MIDI MIDI.

561
00:43:10,477 --> 00:43:17,216
Scott: actually MIDI 2.0 Came out and is vastly superior but MIDI one is used extensively in modern music production.

562
00:43:17,617 --> 00:43:18,520
Scott: MIDI is everywhere.

563
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,405
Scott: You can't avoid it.

564
00:43:19,465 --> 00:43:25,940
Scott: if you actually go to music studios, especially songwriters Those sorts of people it's like there's just MIDI everywhere.

565
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:31,597
Scott: It's just like outside of the music industry like studios recording studios that set of place.

566
00:43:31,617 --> 00:43:32,440
Scott: It's like you don't see the MIDI.

567
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:34,565
Scott: Yep, right because maybe you could.

568
00:43:34,906 --> 00:43:42,411
Scott: it's weird because MIDI used to be a thing that was in everyone's computers in like the 90s And it was removed from everyone's computer.

569
00:43:42,431 --> 00:43:44,180
Scott: All right, cuz we don't need it anymore.

570
00:43:44,261 --> 00:43:45,218
Scott: We just have you know.

571
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:53,528
Rym: But wave my computer still has it because I have pro audio equipment and I have two MIDI keyboards Sure, but most people's computers does not.

572
00:43:53,608 --> 00:44:04,899
Scott: most people will have some sort of software that would if you happen to get a MIDI file And wanted to play it would somehow play it right, but you know used to have a Sound Blaster 16 that had MIDI hardware in it.

573
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:07,752
Rym: Yeah, that was the only is the all 32 audio in your game, right?

574
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:15,386
Scott: The audio in chips challenge was MIDI files and it would basically, you know Your chips challenge.

575
00:44:15,427 --> 00:44:22,052
Scott: when you played chip challenge on Windows 3.1 It wasn't playing a recording of a song it would actually.

576
00:44:22,072 --> 00:44:34,939
Scott: it was as if there was a digital keyboard Like a Casio keyboard in your computer and chips challenge would play that keyboard Right, like a player piano like like a player piano this while the game was running.

577
00:44:35,742 --> 00:44:37,692
Scott: But it doesn't work that way anymore.

578
00:44:37,893 --> 00:44:39,480
Rym: So this is like MIDI is a good example.

579
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,585
Rym: I want to go a little deeper in like.

580
00:44:40,706 --> 00:44:42,073
Rym: why is MIDI not obsolete?

581
00:44:42,093 --> 00:44:44,488
Rym: because if you look at the actual protocol I mean MIDI 2.0.

582
00:44:44,488 --> 00:44:52,660
Rym: It came out recently, but Five years ago ten years ago 20 years like MIDI has survived through the ages.

583
00:44:53,042 --> 00:44:58,754
Scott: But if you ever using the first time I saw MIDI actually I mean MIDI is so old that they were using.

584
00:44:58,774 --> 00:45:01,936
Rym: when I was in elementary school I was fucking around with MIDI on my 486, right?

585
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,344
Scott: I mean I saw.

586
00:45:03,364 --> 00:45:06,280
Scott: the first time I saw it really set up for music production.

587
00:45:06,401 --> 00:45:11,947
Scott: I had seen it for music on a computer but for the production in high school The there was.

588
00:45:12,027 --> 00:45:14,880
Scott: if you took the music theory class instead of going in band.

589
00:45:15,361 --> 00:45:22,206
Scott: They had keyboards with MIDI and computers and stuff, but but I there was a kid I knew I think he's that I don't know what happened to him.

590
00:45:22,246 --> 00:45:24,440
Scott: I think he's must be a conductor or some shit somewhere.

591
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:30,275
Scott: But like when I was in it was like my my parents friends kid.

592
00:45:30,416 --> 00:45:38,420
Scott: and even when he was like young He was like that violin playing conducting Prodigy kind of kid, right, you know that kind.

593
00:45:39,902 --> 00:45:42,997
Scott: And in his house, he had a Commodore 64 with MIDI hooked up.

594
00:45:43,058 --> 00:45:51,780
Rym: Oh Yeah, I wasn't until the 486 era But I had a MIDI keyboard connected to my 486 and I was trying to compose music and playing around with it.

595
00:45:52,164 --> 00:45:56,815
Rym: if you read the spec MIDI seems archaic to the point that it's laughable.

596
00:45:57,358 --> 00:46:06,220
Rym: but Among all the way all the proprietary ways people tried to do the simple task of synchronize a bunch of separate instruments together electronically.

597
00:46:07,061 --> 00:46:17,859
Rym: MIDI was the generic format that could work with everything and become a standard because all it really is is a means to Signal basically a piano roll to or from any number of it.

598
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:18,703
Rym: Well, not any number.

599
00:46:18,723 --> 00:46:22,780
Rym: there was a limited MIDI because this is old technology an arbitrary number of devices.

600
00:46:23,221 --> 00:46:27,374
Rym: MIDI is also used for things like controlling lights and effects on stages.

601
00:46:27,635 --> 00:46:39,551
Rym: as a result because MIDI you can plug an Arduino in a MIDI controller and program something to be like if I hit this key on my keyboard it lights up a light bulb somewhere or does something on my computer like.

602
00:46:39,992 --> 00:46:42,799
Rym: MIDI is an extensible and really useful protocol.

603
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:49,152
Rym: and Because it's so low-level and so generic But that makes it very obtuse to learn the details of.

604
00:46:49,654 --> 00:46:51,660
Rym: it's difficult to learn how to use MIDI correctly.

605
00:46:52,062 --> 00:46:55,600
Rym: It's more it's easy to learn how to use MIDI to accomplish a task.

606
00:46:55,700 --> 00:47:00,135
Rym: It's hard to learn how many works at the low level because you have to learn a lot of old archaic crap.

607
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:05,134
Scott: I found I just you know, the That person that I just mentioned.

608
00:47:05,154 --> 00:47:15,120
Scott: Yeah Assistant conductor at New York Philharmonic It's definitely the right person because it says they made their conducting debut at age 11 with the Greater Bridgeport Youth Orchestra.

609
00:47:18,003 --> 00:47:19,328
Scott: So it's definitely the same person.

610
00:47:19,368 --> 00:47:22,500
Scott: so yeah, I guess they went on to go do what they wanted to do good for that person.

611
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:23,103
Scott: Yeah, all right.

612
00:47:23,866 --> 00:47:26,196
Rym: Now there is a weird case of technology.

613
00:47:26,257 --> 00:47:32,436
Rym: That is Obsolete but necessary but still in use but no one will ever change it like.

614
00:47:32,536 --> 00:47:46,400
Rym: there's an a gray area I'm thinking about is like nuclear weapon control Because that's a weird case where the old technology is Objectively obsolete like to the point of ridiculousness like we're talking 8-inch floppies.

615
00:47:47,701 --> 00:47:53,196
Rym: If you've never heard of an 8-inch floppy, there's a reason that is ancient compared to five and a quarter floppies.

616
00:47:53,737 --> 00:47:54,700
Scott: Yes, but it works.

617
00:47:55,042 --> 00:47:56,852
Scott: Yeah, so and why are you gonna replace it?

618
00:47:56,932 --> 00:47:57,435
Scott: It's working.

619
00:47:57,495 --> 00:47:59,726
Scott: It's still working But you could replace like.

620
00:47:59,766 --> 00:48:01,894
Scott: they probably have a giant room full of giant computers.

621
00:48:01,914 --> 00:48:03,360
Scott: They could replace with one computer.

622
00:48:03,902 --> 00:48:05,831
Scott: But why would you go through the effort?

623
00:48:05,851 --> 00:48:06,896
Scott: you have this thing that works.

624
00:48:06,956 --> 00:48:07,820
Scott: it's sitting there running.

625
00:48:08,644 --> 00:48:10,694
Scott: It's doing its very very important job.

626
00:48:10,754 --> 00:48:11,780
Scott: very very well.

627
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:20,668
Scott: I don't fuck with it for no reason other than to use less computers, but the fact that it's obsolete Introduced became a feature.

628
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:30,387
Rym: It's so obsolete that it makes it Extremely difficult to hack or mess with that kind of system Like the amount of expertise you could use.

629
00:48:30,427 --> 00:48:33,539
Rym: you would need to fuck with a system that is as archaic as that.

630
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:38,060
Rym: Became a feature effectively for this extremely narrow use case.

631
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:41,486
Rym: Mmm, like so Galactica like it's that.

632
00:48:41,587 --> 00:48:42,910
Rym: it's that situation exactly.

633
00:48:43,331 --> 00:48:51,020
Scott: There's also similar use cases relating to not the Like places on earth or different people's, you know life, right?

634
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:53,467
Scott: So it's like think about something like an iPod.

635
00:48:53,527 --> 00:48:59,707
Scott: right an iPod is pretty much obsolete because there are just better Portable music playing devices like.

636
00:49:00,108 --> 00:49:06,420
Scott: even the shittiest Android phone with the shittiest UI is Gonna have like a music playing app on it.

637
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:13,000
Scott: We'll have more storage than an iPod probably more battery life have a better user interface right than an old iPod, right?

638
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:16,860
Scott: So it's like why would you why would you want the old iPod right?

639
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:24,780
Scott: It's like well actually The old iPod could be gotten cheaper and people live in a poor place or the battery will last longer.

640
00:49:25,061 --> 00:49:26,606
Rym: Oh, look Sony still makes Walkman.

641
00:49:26,646 --> 00:49:28,915
Rym: There's mp3 players 8 gigabytes of storage.

642
00:49:28,955 --> 00:49:30,380
Rym: That's pathetic compared to a smartphone.

643
00:49:30,783 --> 00:49:32,859
Rym: I get my an Android phone for a quarter this price.

644
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:34,648
Scott: Maybe it's.

645
00:49:34,729 --> 00:49:36,240
Scott: maybe the iPod is lighter.

646
00:49:36,722 --> 00:49:38,008
Scott: Right because it's you know, it's not.

647
00:49:38,028 --> 00:49:48,168
Scott: the super old ones won't be because they have spinning drives in them But yeah, I had one of those I guess but like an iPod nano is gonna be smaller than any Are about the size of an SD card.

648
00:49:48,209 --> 00:49:50,094
Scott: They're like a tiny little clip.

649
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:58,612
Rym: Yeah, they're basically iPod shuffle situation Which if you're running biking you just want to bring some music with you But you want it to be as light and unobtrusive as possible.

650
00:49:58,973 --> 00:50:01,343
Rym: There's still a use case for that Thing.

651
00:50:01,423 --> 00:50:03,511
Scott: I mean, you know, I guess Apple watch does it.

652
00:50:03,531 --> 00:50:10,580
Scott: it's also yeah, but you know You get the idea is like something that like, you know, it's like oh this has no purpose anymore.

653
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:11,482
Scott: It has been defeated.

654
00:50:11,543 --> 00:50:19,367
Scott: But actually if you have a specific case for it, right where you're you're doing a weird thing Right, maybe you're even.

655
00:50:19,487 --> 00:50:22,340
Scott: maybe you're going camping and just want to carry a light load.

656
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:24,147
Scott: Yeah, suddenly it makes sense.

657
00:50:24,368 --> 00:50:52,399
Rym: like another example when DVD came out it made The purchasing of read-only VHS tapes completely obsolete like overnight especially because the ps2 coming out rapidly increasing adoption and driving down the price of a DVD player, but No one until really the computer era had an accessible means of recording a TV show The time shift it like until we had TiVo's and things like that.

658
00:50:52,800 --> 00:51:01,270
Rym: VHS was the only way to do that and thus VHS was not only not obsolete But was in active use way later than you might realize.

659
00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:07,479
Rym: Oh, yeah, like way longer longevity than the cassette in a lot of ways.

660
00:51:08,543 --> 00:51:20,660
Scott: You also have some cases where someone has a piece of technology that is so Expensive relative to their wealth, right so that they can't really replace it easily or they wouldn't want to write.

661
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:28,180
Rym: So like all my old firewire audio equipment if I if I didn't have enough money to upgrade all of that I would still be using all that old firewire audio equipment.

662
00:51:28,602 --> 00:51:31,332
Scott: Well, not just that but like let's say but it is obsolete.

663
00:51:31,854 --> 00:51:33,560
Scott: Yeah, but let's say you have a car, right?

664
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:34,446
Scott: It's like you don't want to buy.

665
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:36,378
Scott: just buy a new car, right?

666
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:40,413
Scott: Each I mean assuming you're you're in car land, right?

667
00:51:40,454 --> 00:51:41,860
Scott: You have no choice or whatever, right?

668
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:42,978
Scott: Because you shouldn't buy a car.

669
00:51:44,124 --> 00:51:45,880
Scott: But you got an old car and it still works.

670
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:47,305
Scott: There's no reason to replace it.

671
00:51:47,346 --> 00:51:51,120
Scott: doing so will be expensive even though there are better newer cars, right?

672
00:51:51,680 --> 00:52:00,229
Scott: so this car is so old that it doesn't have like an aux audio input or You know an iPhone Bluetooth integration is an old car.

673
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:03,700
Scott: So you using like an FM transmit II thing.

674
00:52:04,043 --> 00:52:10,173
Scott: That's an obsolete technology But because you've got an old car right with no reason to replace it.

675
00:52:10,213 --> 00:52:14,768
Scott: you still need that old obsolete Technology to use.

676
00:52:14,788 --> 00:52:16,897
Scott: you can hear music from your new iPhone.

677
00:52:16,977 --> 00:52:27,754
Rym: as a kid I had a device that was an 8-track tape and you could put it into a car a track player and then in the back Of it it had a slot to slide in a regular cassette tape.

678
00:52:28,336 --> 00:52:34,360
Scott: I had one that was Cassette tape and on the outside of it came a wire that you would plug into your iPod.

679
00:52:34,542 --> 00:52:39,179
Scott: I had one of those too and you put it into the cassette tape part of the.

680
00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:50,899
Rym: But I guess The real point I think I can make around this concept because we're just exploring this concept to see if we can come up with like more narrow show ideas taking up one.

681
00:52:51,840 --> 00:53:03,272
Rym: Technology that is specialized and solves a niche problem tends to have a lot more longevity Because there are very few people Willing and able to try to solve those problems.

682
00:53:03,413 --> 00:53:04,919
Rym: MIDI solved the problem well enough.

683
00:53:05,581 --> 00:53:10,355
Rym: Nobody really had a vested interest in making something that fully covered the use cases of MIDI.

684
00:53:10,676 --> 00:53:18,520
Rym: if anything large companies Have an interest in making a competing proprietary format and trying to steal market share over to their bullshit proprietary platform, right?

685
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:22,792
Scott: It's just because there's something better right doesn't mean it's better.

686
00:53:23,093 --> 00:53:23,594
Scott: You can't.

687
00:53:23,674 --> 00:53:26,424
Scott: it's very hard to unseat something That's good enough.

688
00:53:26,505 --> 00:53:33,120
Scott: if something's that's at the current thing that's out There is kind of sucky and has lots of problems, right?

689
00:53:33,521 --> 00:53:36,732
Scott: Then it is very easy to unseat it with something vastly superior.

690
00:53:36,772 --> 00:53:39,180
Scott: They were it was easy to unseat VHS with DVD.

691
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:43,798
Scott: Yeah for read-only it was not so easy to unseat DVD with booray.

692
00:53:43,818 --> 00:53:48,932
Scott: Yeah Well in a lot of ways DVD is still sort out there kind of a little bit.

693
00:53:49,093 --> 00:53:50,156
Scott: Yeah, you know, it's not.

694
00:53:50,216 --> 00:53:55,832
Scott: it's not totally dead It's more it's less dead like VHS was when DVD came around.

695
00:53:55,953 --> 00:54:00,839
Rym: set-top DVD writers never displaced VHS recorders.

696
00:54:01,863 --> 00:54:03,499
Rym: No computers did that instead.

697
00:54:04,404 --> 00:54:08,962
Rym: Yeah, right, but the other thing I could say is that You can.

698
00:54:09,103 --> 00:54:09,564
Rym: generally.

699
00:54:09,604 --> 00:54:11,589
Rym: this is just like a generalized piece of advice.

700
00:54:12,171 --> 00:54:21,700
Rym: You can make a very good career out of Understanding Something that a lot of people think is obsolete, but in fact is widely used.

701
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:25,972
Rym: Like that is a way to guarantee you will have a job for the rest of your life.

702
00:54:26,614 --> 00:54:42,126
Scott: I think the last thing is that the Regardless of how much you know computers the actual silicon right is replaced with faster smaller more energy-efficient silicon IO devices are largely Unaffected right.

703
00:54:42,569 --> 00:54:46,368
Scott: It's like it's like oh, okay So I got a camera with a better sensor.

704
00:54:46,428 --> 00:54:51,870
Scott: the sensor is the silicon right I do a newer better digital camera Lenses or lenses man, right?

705
00:54:52,312 --> 00:54:53,980
Scott: Oh, I got a brand new awesome computer.

706
00:54:54,081 --> 00:54:56,919
Scott: Well, your mouse is your mouse and your keyboards your keyboard, right?

707
00:54:57,260 --> 00:55:04,580
Rym: Yeah, you know your your webcam is I guess, you know once once we got like modern laser mice or like modern optical mice.

708
00:55:05,581 --> 00:55:08,920
Rym: There's not a lot more advancement that's gonna happen there anytime soon, right?

709
00:55:09,201 --> 00:55:14,160
Scott: It's like a microphones a microphone, you know, I mean look we can do the stars a guitar speaker.

710
00:55:14,961 --> 00:55:21,080
Rym: We we did the show until like four years ago with the same microphone that Lyndon Johnson used to give presidential addresses, right?

711
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:25,180
Scott: It's like, you know, you can get some fancy new amp with fancy silicon in it, right?

712
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:32,241
Scott: You can upgrade that part and then your speakers from your studio in the 70s are probably going to be almost as great as brand New speakers.

713
00:55:32,362 --> 00:55:34,489
Scott: Yeah, it's speakers just figures figures right.

714

00:55:38,182 --> 00:55:42,258
Scott: it's like those accessories.

716
00:55:42,278 --> 00:55:48,360
Scott: and You know ancillary devices your headphones, you know that shit does not go out of style.

717
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,571
Scott: It's really hard to replace it because all of those things are good enough.

718
00:55:52,852 --> 00:56:02,476
Rym: Yep, and material science advances are not Destabilizing enough like yeah, they're slightly lighter drivers and modern monitor headphones, but they're not.

719
00:56:02,556 --> 00:56:04,962
Rym: it's not like a revolution Right.

720
00:56:05,022 --> 00:56:10,617

721
00:56:11,058 --> 00:56:16,495
Scott: very rapidly Right, you know, but now it's Moore's laws kind of slow now.

722
00:56:16,876 --> 00:56:21,933
Scott: So even the silicon obsolete this obsolation is slower than it used to be.

723
00:56:22,134 --> 00:56:35,514
Rym: so, uh, I just Googled for obsolete technology and there's a Wikipedia article that is literally called List of obsolete technology and it's a list of technology and what replaced it.

724
00:56:35,835 --> 00:56:44,880
Rym: and then if it's still used for anything and the Number one is bathing machine Replacement no longer required due to changing social standards of morality.

Rym: This is actually a really interesting list.

734
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:08,988
Rym: I wish I'd googled this at the beginning.

735
00:57:09,309 --> 00:57:11,739
Rym: We could have probably driven a lot more conversation by looking at this thing.

736
00:57:12,464 --> 00:57:14,216
