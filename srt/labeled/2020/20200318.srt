1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,697
Rym: It's Wednesday, March 18th, 2020.

2
00:00:09,697 --> 00:00:09,838
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:11,812 --> 00:00:12,209
Rym: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:13,950
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight.

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,047
Rym: Keep your hands off Azakhan.

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,518
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:35,420
Rym: You know, being stuck at home, working from home, only going outside to, like, buy incremental groceries or go for a run or, like, take a walk and, like, on one hand, sometimes when my life's busy, I want to just stay home.

8
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,696
Rym: Like, I'm just like, "I really just want to stay home tonight and, like, lay on the couch and play video

9
00:00:39,716 --> 00:00:40,038
Rym: games.".

10
00:00:40,523 --> 00:00:45,078
Rym: But, uh, now that I have to stay home every night and play video games, I want to get the fuck out.

11
00:00:45,382 --> 00:00:45,538
Scott: Yup.

12
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,260
Scott: Whatever you tell me to do, I want to do the opposite.

13
00:00:49,362 --> 00:00:52,399
Scott: And reverse psychology doesn't work because I actually know what you want me to do.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,800
Rym: But what's interesting is I'm starting to feel the urge to play a lot of those Steam games that I own and have literally never even installed.

15
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,378
Rym: Like, I'm looking through that list and I'm seeing a lot of games.

16
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:08,956
Rym: and I'm like, "Ooh," or even worse, friends of ours are saying, like, "Hey, why don't we play this

17
00:01:08,997 --> 00:01:09,260
Rym: game?".

18
00:01:09,441 --> 00:01:16,299
Rym: And I'm finding that, like, 70% of the time, if anyone says something like that, I do, in fact, already own that game and didn't even realize it.

19
00:01:17,581 --> 00:01:20,140
Rym: Yesterday, I tried to buy a game on Steam.

20
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:20,677
Scott: You had it.

21
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,618
Rym: And Steam was like, "Yo, dawg, you already own

22
00:01:23,658 --> 00:01:23,819
Rym: this.".

23
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:24,879
Scott: You want to gift it to someone?

24
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:26,359
Scott: You like it that much?

25
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:26,835
Scott: Yup.

26
00:01:28,562 --> 00:01:38,559
Rym: I feel like Steam should just, if you want, if Steam wanted to make money, if they just let you, if you keep buying copies of a game, it just lets you and just, like, increments the counter and you could gift them later, but it didn't tell you that.

27
00:01:38,701 --> 00:01:39,919
Scott: Think they do let you do that?

28
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:44,360
Rym: Uh, they do, but you hold it as a code to, like, give to someone as a gift.

29
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:45,007
Scott: Mm-hmm.

30
00:01:45,602 --> 00:01:46,740
Scott: It's effectively the same thing.

31
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,238
Rym: But it warns you, like, "Hey, you already own

32
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:48,340
Rym: this.".

33
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,999
Rym: If it didn't warn me, I think I would have bought a lot of games, like, three or four times and still not played them.

34
00:01:53,760 --> 00:02:02,919
Scott: So, because of having Twitch Prime, you can claim, all you got to do is do some clicks and every month you get, like, four or five free games, but they're only in the Twitch app.

35
00:02:03,521 --> 00:02:06,780
Scott: So, I installed the Twitch app and there's, like, this mountain of games in there.

36
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,299
Scott: because I have, I click the thing every single month.

37
00:02:09,864 --> 00:02:10,169
Scott: It's like,

38
00:02:10,189 --> 00:02:10,494
Scott: "Whoa!".

39
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:26,319
Scott: I'm like, "There's games in there that, like, I've considered buying or maybe already owned on Steam before or luckily there aren't any games that I bought after, but it's, like, there's some games in there that are, like, real legit games and stuff,

40
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:26,640
Scott: right?".

41
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:39,099
Scott: So, like, I think there's a game called, like, Exit the Gungeon, which is, like, one of those, uh, Super Smash TV type Robotron shooters and the original Enter the Gungeon was just in there.

42
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:43,097
Scott: It's like, "Oh, I'd considered buying that, but I guess I don't have to because it's just

43
00:02:43,137 --> 00:02:43,318
Scott: there.".

44
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:50,819
Rym: Well, now I get desperate if I start going through, like, all the old adventure games or if I, like, replay Quest for Glory.

45
00:02:52,622 --> 00:02:54,900
Rym: I feel like if anything like that starts happening, I know I'm in trouble.

46
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:55,598
Scott: You're in big trouble.

47
00:02:56,241 --> 00:02:57,980
Rym: So, there is actually pretty big news.

48
00:02:58,822 --> 00:03:04,420
Rym: I hope you would have seen this coming and I want to talk a little bit about not Anime Boston specifically.

49
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:09,380
Scott: We've never talked about Anime Boston this much on GeekNights, even when we went to it.

50
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:09,798
Rym: I know.

51
00:03:10,201 --> 00:03:19,320
Scott: And now we've done two newses, I feel like, on two Wednesdays in a row 'cause last time we talked about how they're changing their layout and now it doesn't fucking matter 'cause they're just canceling the whole shmageggy.

52
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:25,200
Rym: Yep, and basically every AnimeCon's canceled at least through, like, May, probably until the early fall at this point.

53
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:25,639
Rym: Who knows?

54
00:03:27,364 --> 00:03:29,719
Rym: But one thing, so Anime Boston canceled, they're doing the right thing.

55
00:03:31,123 --> 00:03:40,700
Scott: You should have been able to see this coming because they'd said something- Everything else already- As soon as things started canceling, you have to assume that everything is canceled, right?

56
00:03:40,884 --> 00:03:41,016
Scott: Yep.

57
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:51,857
Scott: It's like the bike club had, like, a ride for Saturday and I was like, before they announced it was not happening, like, a couple days ago, I signed up for it and I was like, "Well, if they have it, I'll

58
00:03:51,918 --> 00:03:52,219
Scott: go.".

59
00:03:52,401 --> 00:03:53,860
Scott: But yeah, I knew there was no way.

60
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:56,560
Scott: They've closed- they've canceled all bike rides for like eight weeks.

61
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,858
Rym: I mean, even if there's a- even if we get a full-on shelter-in-place order, most usually they leave an exception for "solo exercise,".

62
00:04:03,461 --> 00:04:07,620
Rym: but in places where that's happened, "solo" means you gotta be fucking alone.

63
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:14,718
Scott: What are they gonna do, like, jump- like, if you're two- if we're running together, which not with that I would do that, but like, if two people are running together, what are they gonna do, like, attack them?

64
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:18,220
Rym: Well, they'd probably just come over and be like, "Hey, and what do I do?

65
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,325
Rym: Run from the police?

66
00:04:19,345 --> 00:04:20,591
Rym: I'm not a kid anymore.

67
00:04:20,892 --> 00:04:21,757
Rym: That might put me in more

68
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:22,079
Rym: trouble.".

69
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,519
Scott: What do you- I mean, what are the police gonna do?

70
00:04:23,781 --> 00:04:25,420
Scott: Throw you in jail for running with someone?

71
00:04:25,662 --> 00:04:26,420
Rym: No, I'll give you, like, a fine.

72
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,020
Rym: In France, they've been fining people who are outside without a good reason.

73
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,339
Scott: Running with someone I live with anyway.

74
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,860
Rym: Nope, it's gotta be solo activity if you're outside.

75
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,019
Rym: It depends on the order, whatever they say.

76
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,079
Rym: So, like, we might be able to just go out biking.

77
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,300
Scott: My main concern is, like, biking actually seems like a better idea.

78
00:04:40,741 --> 00:04:43,260
Scott: It's solo, you're not really close to people.

79
00:04:43,641 --> 00:04:44,086
Rym: Yup, like, running.

80
00:04:44,106 --> 00:04:45,180
Rym: I'm completely by myself.

81
00:04:45,480 --> 00:05:12,359
Scott: There's less cars out 'cause people are just home, it's just better all around, there's less pollution 'cause there's less cars, everything's great, but the problem is, I guess it, you know, it's better than skiing, but, like, if somehow something happens, not only is the medical resources already limited and less, there's less available to take care of cyclists that fell down, but also, if you have to take a trip to the ER, you don't want to.

82
00:05:12,685 --> 00:05:12,917
Rym: Yup.

83
00:05:13,241 --> 00:05:15,198
Scott: It's like, I'd rather just stay home with my broken leg.

84
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,279
Scott: It seems like I'll have a better chance of living as my broken leg.

85
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,297
Rym: At least I walked by the clinic near us the other day and it's still pretty much empty, like, no one's really in there.

86
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,600
Rym: Like, there's urgent care, right there.

87
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,120
Scott: Oh, and urgent care, yeah, I'm talking about, like, you don't want to end up in an ER.

88
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:28,488
Scott: No.

89
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,007
Scott: If you end up in an urgent care, that's probably fine, but don't do anything.

90
00:05:32,027 --> 00:05:45,000
Scott: that would have you go to the ER if you, unless it's, you know, well, don't get the virus in the first place, but it would be really suck if something else happened to you, you had to go to an ER and then you got the virus 'cause you went to an ER.

91
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:52,010
Rym: But I did see people on social media having problems with Anime Boston canceling and it seemed to- What problem could you have?

92
00:05:52,031 --> 00:05:53,080
Scott: Everything's canceling.

93
00:05:53,220 --> 00:06:02,120
Rym: It seemed to boil down to, I am too young to understand how hotel reservations work and I don't know how to get a refund on my hotel room that I didn't pay for yet.

94
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,460
Scott: You pick up the phone and call the hotel.

95
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,200
Rym: The kids do not know how to deal with this shit.

96
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,220
Scott: So, don't complain, there's too many, we've talked about this over and over again.

97
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:13,360
Rym: I mean, we talked about this on GeekNights back in, like, 2006.

98
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,360
Scott: I don't know how many times you can keep talking about this.

99
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,700
Rym: When those kids freaked out at Otakon.

100
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,560
Scott: You're going to Anime Boston, you're going to an event, right?

101
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:27,260
Scott: Your hotel reservation, your eating, your food, these other things have nothing to do with the event you're going to.

102
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,280
Scott: It's not their responsibility, right?

103
00:06:29,981 --> 00:06:33,920
Scott: Uh, if you have a problem with your hotel reservation, that's between you and the hotel.

104
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:38,199
Scott: PAX, Anime Boston, fucking World Series, whatever you're going to.

105
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:46,180
Rym: Well, actually that does get complicated- That does get complicated in situations like where PAX is now, where you book your hotel officially through the event.

106
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,280
Scott: It doesn't matter, it's still between you and the hotel.

107
00:06:48,401 --> 00:06:50,320
Scott: That service they provide is just a convenience.

108
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,620
Rym: Nope, you actually can't cancel with the hotel until right before the con.

109
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,440
Rym: You have to go through their service to cancel it.

110
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,640
Scott: Right, but it's not- the convention isn't running the service.

111
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:04,080
Scott: They're just, like, paying something to do that to make it easy for you so that when you go to their website, you can find a hotel easily.

112
00:07:06,022 --> 00:07:08,140
Scott: It's not like you're paying the convention for the hotel.

113
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:21,418
Rym: Yeah, I think the point is more just that people, weirdly, still seem to go to a lot of events that they are passionate about, yet somehow don't know anything about those events or about how to exist in the real world.

114
00:07:22,301 --> 00:07:24,416
Scott: Yeah, people don't- when in school do.

115
00:07:24,437 --> 00:07:26,619
Scott: they teach you, "Here's how to reserve a hotel room, here's how it

116
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:26,740
Scott: works.".

117
00:07:26,861 --> 00:07:33,079
Rym: The first time I ever had to reserve a hotel room on my own in my life, I actually, like, went to the hotel's website and, like, read it.

118
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,978
Rym: Like, I read, like, "Oh, here's what to

119
00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:36,039
Rym: do.".

120
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:41,140
Scott: 90% of questions about anything on the internet are answered easily by Google and people ask them anyway.

121
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:42,238
Scott: That is not new.

122
00:07:42,682 --> 00:07:49,619
Scott: That is a generic worldwide problem of people asking questions without searching and reading for the answer.

123
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:54,760
Scott: Now, the rest of what I'm about to say, this is not- -That is why we seem like we know things.

124
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,706
Scott: Yeah, I don't know much more than you.

125
00:07:55,726 --> 00:08:06,900
Scott: Even though we're just the only thing that we know is when I have a question, I know how to use Google and get the answer and read and understand and think about it for several minutes before I ask.

126
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,720
Scott: That is the only reason I seem smart.

127
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,107
Scott: I'm just a moron.

128
00:08:10,148 --> 00:08:13,700
Scott: I have no special knowledge of training except in computer programming.

129
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:17,580
Scott: And even then, there's people way, way smarter than me in that area.

130
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,840
Rym: So, the rest of what I'm about to say does not particularly apply to Anime Boston.

131
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:26,032
Rym: I don't know anything about the inner workings of Anime Boston, but across the board.

132
00:08:26,052 --> 00:08:36,638
Rym: for the last several weeks, a lot of events and conventions have been saying things like, like, if people ask them if they're gonna cancel, they've been saying no, even though- You say no until you say yes.

133
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,320
Rym: But in many cases, internally, they want to say yes.

134
00:08:40,722 --> 00:08:42,480
Rym: They are actively trying to cancel.

135
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:49,380
Rym: Often, they're legally not able to cancel or even give the appearance that they want to cancel.

136
00:08:49,881 --> 00:08:53,340
Rym: And that's why they tend to say things like, "We are waiting for guidance from the state.

137
00:08:53,643 --> 00:08:55,259
Rym: We are waiting for guidance from the CDC.

138
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,544
Rym: We are observing-".

139
00:08:56,785 --> 00:08:59,559
Rym: because they have all these contracts and nonsense and insurance.

140
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:17,980
Rym: And depending, like, if a convention, like an average convention, did the right thing and canceled before they had a good excuse to, and just the fact that there is a pandemic is apparently not a good enough excuse, then, like, the hotels and everyone can just sue them or keep deposits and just completely fuck them over.

141
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,600
Scott: I'll always remember, I learned this lesson, believe it or not, in fucking first grade, right?

142
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,220
Scott: I was in first grade, and they told us, "Man, we got a guy coming.

143
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,237
Scott: He's gonna put on a fucking laser

144
00:09:28,278 --> 00:09:28,460
Scott: show.".

145
00:09:28,621 --> 00:09:30,780
Scott: And I'm a fucking nerd, and I'm like, "Oh, fuck yes.

146
00:09:31,521 --> 00:09:33,631
Scott: This is gonna be a laser show at school.

147
00:09:33,651 --> 00:09:35,318
Scott: This is gonna be fucking

148
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:35,660
Scott: awesome.".

149
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:40,200
Rym: So the word "laser," until about the year 1992, the word "laser" got me going a little bit.

150
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,852
Scott: This is first grade, right?

151
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:42,840
Scott: This is a long time ago.

152
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:43,458
Scott: Lasers.

153
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,900
Scott: I think this might have not even- not even 1990 yet, and I was like, "Oh my god, a laser light show.

154
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,384
Scott: This is gonna be

155
00:09:48,485 --> 00:09:48,768
Scott: sick.".

156
00:09:49,253 --> 00:09:49,414
Scott: Right?

157
00:09:49,475 --> 00:09:50,000
Scott: First grade.

158
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,345
Scott: We go to the gym.

159
00:09:51,646 --> 00:09:54,480
Scott: We're all sitting on the floor waiting for the laser show, right?

160
00:09:54,941 --> 00:09:58,097
Scott: And then they come in and tell us, "Well, the laser show's not

161
00:09:58,157 --> 00:09:58,539
Scott: happening.".

162
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:01,060
Scott: And why was the laser show not happening?

163
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:12,420
Scott: Because in the contract with the laser show guy, right, they promised that they would have a dark room for the laser guy to do his laser show in, 'cause if it wasn't dark, fucking didn't work, right?

164
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:17,580
Scott: They had put black construction paper over the windows in the gym.

165
00:10:17,861 --> 00:10:18,958
Rym: That's not gonna cut it.

166
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,780
Scott: It was not sufficiently dark, right?

167
00:10:22,441 --> 00:10:25,235
Scott: And so the guy showed up, he said, "It's not dark enough,".

168
00:10:25,396 --> 00:10:26,039
Scott: and then he left.

169
00:10:27,081 --> 00:10:33,140
Scott: And they still had to fucking pay the guy because otherwise they would have been in breach of contract.

170
00:10:33,688 --> 00:10:33,878
Rym: Yup.

171
00:10:34,322 --> 00:10:38,860
Scott: And I learned everything I needed to learn right then in first grade, and all that shit is still true.

172
00:10:39,481 --> 00:10:42,695
Rym: So basically, all these cons where you're like, "Why haven't you cancelled yet?

173
00:10:42,715 --> 00:10:43,418
Rym: Why have you cancelled

174
00:10:43,438 --> 00:10:43,599
Rym: yet?".

175
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:51,000
Rym: Odds are they are desperately trying to cancel, and there's a bunch of legal nonsense that there's no escape from that.

176
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,920
Rym: Like, there's no way for them to escape.

177
00:10:53,020 --> 00:11:00,948
Scott: Anyway, so the interesting thing that actually matters, right, is what will the consequences be of, specifically in the anime U.S.

178
00:11:01,008 --> 00:11:05,980
Scott: community, of there not being anime conventions for what seems like several months?

179
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,160
Scott: Yup.

180
00:11:06,341 --> 00:11:13,740
Rym: So one, there are a lot of mid-tier celebrities where the convention circuit is, like, it for them making money.

181
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:14,096
Rym: Oh, yeah.

182
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,600
Rym: Like, that is really hard for some of these people.

183
00:11:18,422 --> 00:11:29,980
Rym: Like, people who do the convention circuit as their primary job, especially Comic-Con types, like, someone who shows up and, like, does signings and autographs and prints and things, like, those people just have no way to make money now.

184
00:11:30,306 --> 00:11:30,456
Scott: Yup.

185
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,080
Rym: 'Cause their other fallback is giving talks, which they also can't do right now.

186
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:40,880
Scott: If you're a voice actor, it's like, depending on what, you know, if you're an anime voice actor, a significant part of your, you don't make a lot of money doing that.

187
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:41,460
Rym: Yup, in America.

188
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:50,380
Scott: A significant part of your money comes from doing all these cons and stuff, and you better do a whole shit ton of voice acting now to make up for it.

189
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:50,611
Scott: Yup.

190
00:11:50,780 --> 00:12:03,980
Scott: But it's not like this, you know, but now there's less money going into anime to pay for voice acting, so people in the Artist Alley biz, in the, I am a dealer in a dealer's room, I toured the dealer's rooms and saw my merch biz.

191
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,159
Rym: Like, our friend Luke is probably in deep shit right now.

192
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:11,255
Scott: All these businesses that do that sort of stuff are gonna be having a hard time.

193
00:12:11,335 --> 00:12:12,178
Scott: Merch sell anyone, right?

194
00:12:13,562 --> 00:12:22,540
Rym: Also just, not businesses, but just nerds who use Artist Alleys as supplemental income, if they've relied on that income up to this point, that's just gone for pretty much the rest of this year.

195
00:12:23,421 --> 00:12:23,621
Scott: Right.

196
00:12:23,782 --> 00:12:32,900
Scott: People who are in anime, nerdy hobbies, like cosplayers, they're gonna have a lot of fucking time to make like the best damn cosplays you've ever seen.

197
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:33,164
Scott: Yup.

198
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:45,060
Scott: Which may mean more money for people selling cosplay supplies online, things like that, because those cosplayers are gonna be sewing up a storm at home with no cosplay contest, right?

199
00:12:45,320 --> 00:13:00,940
Scott: Cosplay photographers are gonna, instead of showing up at a con, taking a bunch of photos, might get, might be able to get more jobs, like hired out by a cosplayer to come and take photos because they got no con to go to and they made ten amazing costumes, more amazing than you've ever seen because they had no deadline.

200
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,460
Rym: I think something else is gonna happen.

201
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,953
Scott: They might not finish because they have no deadline.

202
00:13:05,255 --> 00:13:06,039
Scott: Depending on the person.

203
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:21,218
Rym: For a lot of younger fans of things, like Anime Boston is a good example of this, there are more people out there than you might realize who tie their identity, like the highlight of their year every year is going to like the Anime Con.

204
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:22,600
Rym: that is their Anime Con.

205
00:13:24,341 --> 00:13:34,460
Rym: And while it may seem trite, those people are, they do, they cannot deal with this because this is not something that has really happened to American nerds in modern history.

206
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,740
Scott: Right, the cons, you know, at first cons were a new thing, like we live to see cons rise.

207
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:39,087
Scott: Yup.

208
00:13:39,882 --> 00:13:41,800
Scott: You can just listen to any Eatnights in the beginning.

209
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,820
Rym: Yup, and cons can fall, we've seen cons fall.

210
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:58,320
Scott: Right, but now cons are so regular that they become like a habit, a routine for people, so I wonder, if that routine is now broken, how, what percentage, will there be a drop off when they come back eventually?

211
00:13:58,562 --> 00:13:59,220
Rym: Or a surge.

212
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:10,539
Scott: Or a surge of like, "Oh my god, I have been so desperate for a con, oh my god, yes, I saved my money, I didn't go to any cons last year, I got extra money now, I got right, let's con

213
00:14:10,579 --> 00:14:10,840
Scott: baby.".

214
00:14:11,405 --> 00:14:12,740
Rym: I, my guess.

215
00:14:13,342 --> 00:14:16,129
Scott: Or, "Oh, I didn't go to Anime Boston last year,".

216
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:19,820
Scott: right, which is a pretty great anime con, all things considered.

217
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:26,099
Scott: And it's like, "I didn't miss it, oh it's back, meh, I was fine last year not going to it, I'm done with this

218
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:26,360
Scott: thing.".

219
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:31,878
Scott: Yup, I worry especially- "I picked up something else while cons were gone to fill that hole in my life, I don't need to do that

220
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:32,240
Scott: anymore.".

221
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:42,560
Rym: Especially anime cons because they have a pretty high churn of like younger people go, get into the culture, get real excited, and then realize there's not a lot for them to do and they kind of, they fade.

222
00:14:43,201 --> 00:14:52,700
Rym: I feel like if you break that chain too much, like one year might even be enough, you won't energize a new generation and I think anime cons next year might actually have a problem.

223
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:58,700
Rym: Lastly- Gaming cons I think will have a surge because that is an audience that sticks around.

224
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:05,820
Scott: Lastly, you know, companies like in the industry, right, so like Funimation or those kind of, you know, whatever industry, just comic companies, right?

225
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:12,860
Scott: It's like, how much money do they really get from the marketing, on their return for the marketing investment they make in the cons?

226
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,960
Scott: You know, Crunchyroll for say, right?

227
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:21,880
Scott: It's like, who knows, but they'll probably be just fine, people are going to be watching more- Ah, but what if- People are watching more Crunchyroll and Funimation at home, right?

228
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:31,120
Rym: What if all these gaming and anime companies like miss a whole con season, their numbers don't change, thus undermining any reason to ever continue to support these cons.

229
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:44,820
Scott: Well, that could happen, but also I know people, I personally know people whose job it is to be event coordinator for industry companies, video games, anime companies, other nerdy companies, right?

230
00:15:45,321 --> 00:15:48,400
Scott: Will they be out of a job now that events are not happening?

231
00:15:49,022 --> 00:15:49,660
Rym: Yep, or at least furloughed.

232
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,743
Scott: Will they just be laid off?

233
00:15:50,803 --> 00:15:56,220
Scott: It's like, you know, if you're the, I don't know who the event person at Funimation is, but they must have one, right?

234
00:15:57,461 --> 00:16:04,015
Scott: You know, there's a person who manages Funimation's presence at all these anime cons, if there's no anime cons to go to, is that person just screwed now?

235
00:16:04,075 --> 00:16:04,696
Scott: Are they laid off?

236
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:05,678
Scott: Are they going to do something else?

237
00:16:05,738 --> 00:16:06,500
Scott: What's going to happen?

238
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,560
Rym: It basically depends on the health of the company.

239
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,380
Scott: And there are many, many such people out there at different companies.

240
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:21,040
Rym: Yep, like healthy or successful companies tend to keep highly skilled people and would probably continue to pay those people and have them do training or do another role for a while or work from home.

241
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,660
Rym: Maybe furlough them, but if you get lower into the tier.

242
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:31,796
Scott: But it's like if your skill is event coordinator, event manager, person, no one needs you right now.

243
00:16:31,836 --> 00:16:33,480
Scott: No one has events right now.

244
00:16:33,561 --> 00:16:34,340
Rym: If you do get laid off.

245
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,700
Scott: You need to go into a different field, at least temporarily.

246
00:16:39,022 --> 00:16:42,160
Rym: I'm glad we didn't actually plan our con for this year is all I'm saying.

247
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,647
Rym: So yeah, pretty much like I'm going to be blunt with you.

248
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:51,820
Rym: Any nerd con in America, at least through like end of May, maybe even June?

249
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:56,580
Scott: Maybe someone can have one out in the middle of nowhere, but you can't have anyone visiting from far away.

250
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,650
Rym: That would almost be worse.

251
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,579
Rym: Like Zenkai Con.

252
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,473
Scott: Local only con in Nebraska.

253
00:17:01,514 --> 00:17:02,640
Scott: How many cases are in Nebraska?

254
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:09,215
Rym: Yeah, but good lord, a surprising number of people travel long distances to go to dinky little cornfield.

255
00:17:09,256 --> 00:17:11,079
Scott: cornfield con locals only.

256
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,653
Rym: You know, you know where no one was going to get coronavirus.

257
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:14,780
Rym: if Cinecon still happens?

258
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:15,428
Scott: No.

259
00:17:18,382 --> 00:17:21,940
Rym: I will never forget being guests at a con where there were more guests than a 10.

260
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,406
Scott: I just want to do another tiny news.

261
00:17:23,607 --> 00:17:23,969
Scott: Yeah.

262
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,599
Scott: So anime adjacent topic Gunpla.

263
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:27,762
Scott: Right.

264
00:17:27,883 --> 00:17:30,100
Scott: So if you don't know, Gunpla is Gundam model building.

265
00:17:30,301 --> 00:17:30,501
Scott: Right.

266
00:17:30,562 --> 00:17:31,706
Scott: You make plastic models.

267
00:17:32,087 --> 00:17:35,620
Scott: They're not as hard as you think, but they're way fancier than Lego and a lot of fun.

268
00:17:36,081 --> 00:17:42,235
Scott: Even if you don't get like me, I've been doing them for many, many years since like almost 20 years, over 15 years for sure.

269
00:17:44,841 --> 00:17:45,362
Scott: And I never.

270
00:17:45,422 --> 00:17:51,240
Scott: I've tried to paint them a couple of times, but it's like maybe if I had a house and I could set up an airbrush booth, I would do it.

271
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,369
Scott: But it's like, you know, I don't do the painting.

272
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:54,073
Scott: I don't do whatever.

273
00:17:54,093 --> 00:17:55,720
Scott: I just build it according to the instructions.

274
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:56,548
Scott: It's still fun.

275
00:17:56,589 --> 00:17:57,579
Scott: It still looks pretty great.

276
00:17:59,181 --> 00:18:00,345
Scott: One just came out.

277
00:18:00,665 --> 00:18:00,926
Scott: Right.

278
00:18:01,287 --> 00:18:05,680
Scott: That is it's the first time I've ever seen this where it's a Gundam kit.

279
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,730
Scott: It's RG real grade Gundam kit from Bandai.

280
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,640
Scott: looks it comes in the same box as all the other RG Gundam kits.

281
00:18:12,181 --> 00:18:18,100
Scott: But what is inside the box is a plastic model that you put together exactly the same way you put together every other Gundam kit.

282
00:18:18,781 --> 00:18:20,204
Scott: It is not a Gundam robot.

283
00:18:20,665 --> 00:18:28,060
Scott: They have released Ava unit zero one from the new movies that that difference right with the red dots on the front.

284
00:18:28,421 --> 00:18:31,290
Scott: It's slightly different from the original TV, but it doesn't fucking matter.

285
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:31,591
Scott: Right.

286
00:18:32,253 --> 00:18:34,440
Rym: It matters to someone.

287
00:18:35,663 --> 00:18:35,803
Scott: Sure.

288
00:18:36,445 --> 00:18:42,900
Scott: As a actual Gundam model, not as like some separate Bandai Ava model, which is really interesting.

289
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,664
Scott: Also, the model seems fantastic.

290
00:18:44,704 --> 00:18:50,860
Scott: Also, I proved it and I have it already and Gundam models are a great way to spend your time if you're stuck inside a whole bunch.

291
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,324
Rym: Mustn't kill time, boy.

292
00:18:52,525 --> 00:18:52,725
Rym: Right.

293
00:18:53,548 --> 00:18:55,072
Scott: And they have two versions.

294
00:18:55,153 --> 00:18:57,460
Scott: I got the cheaper version, which is just a model.

295
00:18:58,061 --> 00:19:04,220
Scott: If you buy the fancier version, it comes with like the transport stand, you know, when the Ava's on the truck and then they stand it up.

296
00:19:04,761 --> 00:19:07,049
Scott: It comes with that stand or the one that, you know, it's in the.

297
00:19:07,109 --> 00:19:10,340
Scott: it's in the thing and then it shoots up and goes to the city street level.

298
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,667
Scott: And then like the Ava gets, you know, unplugged from it.

299
00:19:12,988 --> 00:19:13,950
Rym: That's that's how you would.

300
00:19:14,412 --> 00:19:14,572
Scott: Yeah.

301
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:15,094
Scott: That thing.

302
00:19:15,294 --> 00:19:15,515
Scott: Right.

303
00:19:15,675 --> 00:19:17,280
Rym: That's the Mokushiroku part of Ava.

304
00:19:17,701 --> 00:19:23,174
Scott: And it also the fancy one that has the stand also includes an 80 field plastic piece that you wait.

305
00:19:23,194 --> 00:19:25,720
Rym: an Ava without an 80 field is super vulnerable to attack.

306
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:26,441
Scott: Sure.

307
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:28,185
Scott: I have the vulnerable one.

308
00:19:29,528 --> 00:19:34,680
Scott: But yeah, you can buy either one and it'll be a great way to distract yourself from whatever.

309
00:19:34,961 --> 00:19:35,241
Rym: Yeah.

310
00:19:35,522 --> 00:19:38,148
Scott: And another time, these aren't expensive, by the way.

311
00:19:38,449 --> 00:19:43,000
Scott: Like, you know, you think if you want to like, you know, you're not sure if you're into Gundam models or whatever.

312
00:19:43,581 --> 00:19:44,243
Scott: They're only like.

313
00:19:44,664 --> 00:19:47,011
Scott: you can get cheap ones like 10 bucks, 15 bucks, 20 bucks.

314
00:19:47,091 --> 00:19:49,920
Rym: Even if you don't do that good a job, like if you file the instructions, just make them.

315
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,351
Rym: They'll look OK unless you get real close or a hyper nerd.

316
00:19:53,531 --> 00:19:53,692
Scott: Right.

317
00:19:53,732 --> 00:19:56,060
Scott: Unless you break it or something, which I've only done once.

318
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,047
Rym: They will look great, but they'll look fine.

319
00:19:58,108 --> 00:20:00,960
Scott: They look pretty damn good if you don't do any fancy biz to them.

320
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,590
Scott: Just build it according to the instructions.

321
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,180
Scott: Put the decals on for your first one.

322
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,228
Rym: They're diminishing returns for the fancy biz.

323
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:09,140
Rym: It's more about the process of the fancy biz than the result.

324
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,146
Scott: Yeah, it's all about building.

325
00:20:10,186 --> 00:20:12,120
Scott: Like after I build it, like I don't really want anymore.

326
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,198
Rym: I mean, you want to play with it?

327
00:20:13,821 --> 00:20:14,444
Scott: It's not really.

328
00:20:14,605 --> 00:20:17,540
Scott: It's sort of like, all right, some of them, if it looks good enough, it could be a decoration.

329
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,488
Scott: But mostly it's like, all right, I had fun building it.

330
00:20:19,589 --> 00:20:20,051
Scott: Who wants what?

331
00:20:20,151 --> 00:20:21,517
Scott: Who wants it?

332
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:22,200
Scott: Anyone want this?

333
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,164
Rym: So another tiny news.

334
00:20:24,184 --> 00:20:26,613
Rym: I have not seen the Sonic the Hedgehog movie.

335
00:20:26,633 --> 00:20:28,300
Rym: I actually haven't even seen Detective Pikachu yet.

336
00:20:28,489 --> 00:20:28,639
Rym: Nope.

337
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,960
Rym: People have told me that Detective Pikachu is pretty good.

338
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,660
Scott: I'm sure it's probably moderately funny.

339
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,280
Rym: And people have told me that Sonic the Hedgehog is better than expected.

340
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:42,900
Rym: And numerous people have said it is worth watching, but will never need to be re-watched.

341
00:20:43,561 --> 00:20:43,822
Scott: Yeah.

342
00:20:43,862 --> 00:20:46,150
Scott: I mean, the thing is, I can already imagine.

343
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:48,760
Scott: I feel like I can perfectly imagine exactly what it is.

344
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,973
Scott: I have a strong, not 100%, but like 90% confidence that I'm right.

345
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,287
Scott: And knowing what it is.

346
00:20:55,368 --> 00:20:57,380
Scott: And because I know what it is, why do I need to see it?

347
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,460
Scott: I've seen things like that.

348
00:20:58,661 --> 00:21:01,760
Rym: I mean, I saw the He-Man live action movie in the theater.

349
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:03,538
Scott: So.

350
00:21:03,942 --> 00:21:04,978
Rym: Same kind of thing.

351
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:12,920
Rym: But apparently the Sonic movie has eclipsed Detective Pikachu at the box office.

352
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:22,300
Rym: Which is interesting because I've suspected for a long time that there are a terrifying number of Sonic the Hedgehog fans who just keep quiet about it.

353
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,140
Rym: Like it's there.

354
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:23,765
Scott: They're not quiet.

355
00:21:23,785 --> 00:21:24,899
Scott: You just don't look where they are.

356
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:25,940
Rym: Oh, I see the loud ones.

357
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:26,940
Rym: They're not quiet at all.

358
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,107
Rym: Oh, I see the loud ones.

359
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:30,139
Rym: But I see the loud Pokemon people too.

360
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,500
Rym: They feel like they have equal power online.

361
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,120
Rym: I think there's a lot of closet Sonic the Hedgehog fans hiding out.

362
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,783
Scott: They're not closet.

363
00:21:38,863 --> 00:21:41,130
Scott: Sonic is well known to be popular.

364
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,454
Scott: It is not a closet thing.

365
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:44,319
Scott: It is common knowledge.

366
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,900
Rym: But it feels equally popular to say Pokemon.

367
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,629
Scott: Uh, yes.

368
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:49,359
Scott: Sonic is huge.

369
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,412
Rym: I feel like Sonic is huger than the public persona.

370
00:21:53,452 --> 00:21:55,680
Rym: lets on based on these box office returns.

371
00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:00,040
Scott: I mean, I'm, I know how big Sonic is, is big, bigger than Pokemon though.

372
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:05,780
Scott: I mean, you can tell if you need numbers cause you're not like paying attention to what's going on and you don't see the Sonic fandom.

373
00:22:06,441 --> 00:22:15,280
Scott: You can just look at the sales of the Sonic the Hedgehog comic book before it moved to Archie, the longest running crazy good selling comic.

374
00:22:15,441 --> 00:22:17,679
Scott: It's like who the fuck buys comic books, right?

375
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:26,660
Scott: But somehow the Sonic comic was selling that fucking well for that long a period of time before it switched because the license ran out or whatever.

376
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,372
Scott: And it's like, if that doesn't tell you how popular Sonic is, right?

377
00:22:30,413 --> 00:22:32,300
Scott: The fact that it's comic book is doing that well.

378
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,440
Scott: You look at like this comic books, IDW puts out comic books of just about every licensed fucking property.

379
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:42,780
Scott: They got Transformers, Ghostbusters, Star Trek, Ninja Turtles, my little pony.

380
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,231
Scott: They got comics, everything Sonic outsold.

381
00:22:45,271 --> 00:22:46,738
Scott: all those fuckers, right?

382
00:22:48,201 --> 00:23:00,000
Rym: You know, so it's, you know, Hey, the only other funny thing is I love when, uh, especially like nerdy news mentions an actor cause they usually will put like parenthetically, like here are two movies this person was in.

383
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:06,260
Rym: So you're like, know who this person was, but I always love to see which two movies they pick for someone who's been extremely prolific.

384
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,564
Rym: So they list Jim Carrey.

385
00:23:09,366 --> 00:23:14,560
Rym: What two movies would you mention if you needed to, uh, like convey to someone who Jim Carrey was?

386
00:23:15,881 --> 00:23:17,620
Scott: Uh, perhaps, uh, Ace Ventura.

387
00:23:18,441 --> 00:23:19,006
Rym: That is the first.

388
00:23:19,046 --> 00:23:20,560
Rym: they list Ace Ventura, Pet Detective.

389
00:23:21,247 --> 00:23:21,919
Scott: Uh, The Mask.

390
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,260
Rym: Oh, they, they list The Truman Show is the other one.

391
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,163
Scott: Oh, Truman Show.

392
00:23:25,204 --> 00:23:26,007
Scott: There you go.

393
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:26,871
Scott: That's all right.

394
00:23:27,192 --> 00:23:28,880
Scott: I think those are, that's the correct two choices.

395
00:23:30,261 --> 00:23:31,343
Scott: Think of Truman Show.

396
00:23:31,804 --> 00:23:38,240
Scott: because, uh, while I love the concept of Truman Show and I think he actually did a good job acting in Truman Show.

397
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,016
Rym: Yeah, I thought the movie was not good as a movie.

398
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:40,840
Scott: Right.

399
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:48,800
Scott: There's something about like actually that movie and also another Jim Carrey movie, the, the serious one that everyone loves with the, with the brain thing.

400
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,120
Rym: Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.

401
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:50,441
Rym: Yeah.

402
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:56,820
Scott: Another movie that I thought that like that one I loved that one and the Truman Show I think are just like mad overrated and I don't like them.

403
00:23:57,141 --> 00:24:01,400
Rym: See, I think Truman Show is overrated and I didn't, it had a lot of flaws, but I think Eternal Sunshine was fine.

404
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:05,753
Scott: No, I don't see, like there's so many people who are like Eternal Sunshine, best, oh my God, it's amazing.

405
00:24:05,773 --> 00:24:07,800
Scott: And I'm like, eh, whatever.

406
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:17,700
Rym: But anyway, it's time for Things of the Day.

407
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:25,800
Rym: So I found this channel that talks about old stuff and one thing they talked about was Russian warships.

408
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,319
Rym: And of course, if you just- That's a very Rym thing.

409
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,660
Rym: That's a very Rym thing, like Russian warships.

410
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,579
Scott: There's more Rym than that.

411
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:36,840
Rym: Like let's talk about this, like World War I era and maybe like pre-World War I era Russian warships.

412
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:43,138
Scott: So when we had the, uh, what was the first one with the iron, what the fuck was its name?

413
00:24:43,219 --> 00:24:43,660
Scott: The Monitor.

414
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,619
Rym: The Monitor and the Merrimack.

415
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,264
Scott: Right, right.

416
00:24:45,284 --> 00:24:46,759
Scott: So what did Russia have at that time?

417
00:24:47,701 --> 00:24:50,000
Rym: At that time, I don't think there were ironclads over there.

418
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,960
Scott: So what was like the first Russian ironclad?

419
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:56,600
Rym: I don't know a lot about pre-World War I Russian naval stuff, so give me a break.

420
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,320
Scott: That's a very Rym thing though to know.

421
00:24:58,682 --> 00:25:01,019
Scott: I know about World War I. Probably a board game about it.

422
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:08,140
Rym: I know about like the late pre-dreadnought era onward with Russia when it comes to the Navy.

423
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,160
Rym: And I learned about something based on this YouTube video that I did not know about.

424
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:16,020
Rym: When you think of a warship, you think that it's like a ship, like it's long.

425
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:23,280
Rym: And there's probably, even if you don't know anything about ships, you probably assume there's reasons why pretty much every ship is long.

426
00:25:23,943 --> 00:25:25,400
Rym: As opposed to just being like a big circle.

427
00:25:25,701 --> 00:25:31,820
Scott: I don't know anything about boats, but it just makes common sense that like something pointy in the front would sort of cut through the water.

428
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:35,260
Scott: Like you just imagine, even though I know nothing about hydrodynamics, right?

429
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,620
Scott: It just sort of makes sense that like a pointy boat would cut through the water.

430
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:44,700
Scott: Whereas like a big wide boat trying to move forward would be pushing against a lot more water and would move slower, right?

431
00:25:44,941 --> 00:25:46,980
Scott: That's why like when you're swimming, you want to keep your body tight.

432
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,600
Scott: It's just common sense, right?

433
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,100
Scott: Could be right or wrong regardless.

434
00:25:50,621 --> 00:25:54,200
Scott: And then also you have to imagine if you're a warship, right?

435
00:25:54,722 --> 00:25:58,560
Scott: If you're big and wide, then it's easy to hit you with torpedoes.

436
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,860
Scott: You want to have, obviously you can't make all sides of you narrow.

437
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,580
Scott: Then you would just be tiny, like a rowboat.

438
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:09,320
Scott: But if you have a pointy side, at least then you can point your pointy side at the enemy and make yourself real hard to hit.

439
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:15,800
Scott: The same way when you're fist fighting with someone, you could stand sideways to give them less surface area to punch you.

440
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:16,600
Rym: So funnily enough.

441
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:21,920
Scott: And then obviously one side of you is still fucking wide, but you can move at least.

442
00:26:22,181 --> 00:26:28,860
Rym: So funnily enough, you're right, but there's two reasons why being long in terms of a fight is important.

443
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,718
Rym: The other side, you're familiar with the concept called crossing the T.

444
00:26:32,984 --> 00:26:34,040
Scott: Oh, you can ram someone.

445
00:26:34,541 --> 00:26:34,582
Rym: No.

446
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:36,040
Rym: Yeah, ramming was the thing.

447
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:41,620
Rym: You realize there was an era in the pre pre dreadnought world where ramming was literally the most fucking effective thing.

448
00:26:42,122 --> 00:26:43,420
Rym: Like ramming was awesome.

449
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:43,898
Scott: Of course.

450
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,720
Scott: And you know how many times you rammed people in puzzle pirates?

451
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:47,740
Rym: There were ships.

452
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,960
Scott: We fucking rammed all the time.

453
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:54,760
Rym: They would literally just put bombs on the end of really long poles and hold them out and ram a ship with the bomb.

454
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:55,353
Scott: Fuck yeah.

455
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,160
Rym: This shit was ridiculous.

456
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:04,120
Rym: But crossing the T is so, you know, the concept of broadside, like you've got to get to can two ships, both have cannons.

457
00:27:04,361 --> 00:27:09,520
Scott: They go right past each other, long sides, alongside, not not hitting each other, just across from each other.

458
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,999
Scott: And then everyone fires their cannons in the other boat.

459
00:27:12,241 --> 00:27:14,920
Scott: You fire a cannon and then a cannonball comes right back at you.

460
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,280
Rym: But that's because the guns are all on the side.

461
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,100
Rym: You can't put all those guns facing forward.

462
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:19,879
Rym: They're in enough space.

463
00:27:20,383 --> 00:27:20,639
Scott: That's right.

464
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:26,980
Scott: So also, I think that like the recoil from the gun doesn't work if you aim it forward unless you only have like one little one.

465
00:27:27,362 --> 00:27:28,360
Rym: No, that would have been fine.

466
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,000
Rym: The problem is you need to line them all up.

467
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,740
Rym: You need like a wide boat to do that, causing problems.

468
00:27:33,021 --> 00:27:38,480
Rym: But the real it's not because it's harder to hit you so much as because you can't shoot back.

469
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,368
Rym: So what the crossing the T is?

470
00:27:40,649 --> 00:27:42,640
Rym: you want to go in front of someone.

471
00:27:42,781 --> 00:27:47,320
Rym: So they're coming at you like a T and you fire your broadside at them one by one as you pass them.

472
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:51,500
Scott: And so they get hit in the front several times and they don't have anything they can shoot back at you with.

473
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,960
Scott: You have to have really good timing with each of those shots, though.

474
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,560
Scott: Otherwise, you just miss because, like I said, they're narrow in the front.

475
00:27:56,724 --> 00:27:56,893
Scott: Yup.

476
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,099
Scott: Whereas broadsides, you can just fire them all at once and they're all going to hit.

477
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:15,260
Rym: So when you look at Russian space stuff or Russian nuclear stuff or Russian tanks or anything, for a lot of reasons I don't want to get into, it's usually like the rest of the world did this and Russia did something weird relative to the rest of the world.

478
00:28:16,281 --> 00:28:19,197
Rym: And that actually wasn't true for a lot of naval aviation.

479
00:28:19,237 --> 00:28:19,800
Rym: Not naval aviation.

480
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,620
Scott: Like diesel submarines.

481
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:21,302
Rym: Yup.

482
00:28:21,484 --> 00:28:22,720
Rym: Well, no, we did diesel submarines.

483
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,000
Scott: No, but they still have them, I thought.

484
00:28:24,261 --> 00:28:25,600
Rym: Ah, so they have nuclear subs.

485
00:28:25,884 --> 00:28:26,118
Rym: Okay.

486
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,000
Rym: That you're thinking of North Korea, maybe.

487
00:28:28,262 --> 00:28:28,520
Rym: Maybe.

488
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,622
Rym: Russia actually has.

489
00:28:29,943 --> 00:28:36,200
Rym: Russia is one of the only nations that has modern nuclear submarines, but they do have Old Smokey, their one aircraft carrier.

490
00:28:36,566 --> 00:28:37,137
Scott: Oh, that was it.

491
00:28:37,542 --> 00:28:38,196
Rym: Yeah, it was the one.

492
00:28:38,401 --> 00:28:38,979
Scott: Yeah, it was the one.

493
00:28:40,481 --> 00:28:42,620
Rym: Old Smokey, it bellows black smoke all the time.

494
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,697
Rym: No one can really explain why.

495
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:44,600
Scott: Yeah, that one.

496
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:52,780
Rym: Anyway, so Russia apparently had circular warships at one point.

497
00:28:52,921 --> 00:28:55,000
Rym: These were not used, as far as I can tell.

498
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:55,634
Rym: I wonder why.

499
00:28:56,161 --> 00:28:57,239
Rym: But some were built.

500
00:28:57,821 --> 00:29:00,540
Rym: There were a lot of ideas as to why they should have been built.

501
00:29:00,801 --> 00:29:08,360
Rym: And this YouTube video will take you on a 15-minute journey into what I can only describe as a really terrible idea.

502
00:29:10,241 --> 00:29:14,720
Rym: Like, if Thomas Jefferson were alive in this era, he would have bought as many of these as he could.

503
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:22,258
Rym: If you don't know why I'm making that joke, it's because Thomas Jefferson is famous for having the worst possible idea for how the U.S.

504
00:29:22,278 --> 00:29:22,960
Rym: should have a navy.

505
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:34,680
Rym: Instead of spending money to make a few really big, powerful ships of the line, why don't we just make a ton of really tiny, shitty little ships with shitty little cannons and just swarm them out there?

506
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:36,120
Scott: It works for pirates.

507
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,239
Rym: Yep, you know what it does not work against?

508
00:29:38,721 --> 00:29:41,080
Rym: Even one British Navy ship of the line.

509
00:29:41,521 --> 00:29:43,699
Scott: Yeah, none of your shots would damage it.

510
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:48,360
Rym: A hundred Rym and scots trying to take down Mike Tyson ends with a hundred dead Rym and scots.

511
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,480
Rym: And Mike Tyson, he's bruised at most his knuckle.

512
00:29:51,761 --> 00:29:56,460
Scott: Right, if someone has metal armor, it doesn't matter how many pistols you have, it won't penetrate.

513
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:00,015
Rym: That's why the Monitor and the Merrimack just spent an entire day shooting cannonballs.

514
00:30:00,035 --> 00:30:01,140
Rym: They did nothing at each other.

515
00:30:01,504 --> 00:30:01,576
Scott: Yep.

516
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,292
Rym: So, this is pretty great.

517
00:30:03,312 --> 00:30:03,980
Rym: What's your thing of the day?

518
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:16,580
Scott: So, I want you to imagine a piece of plastic, or glass maybe, I can't really tell, and that piece of plastic or glass is transparent and has the same refractive index as water.

519
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:20,250
Scott: So, when you put it in water, it effectively disappears.

520
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:24,180
Scott: You can't see it anymore because how do you see a transparent piece of plastic and water?

521
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,000
Scott: Well, because the light would go in the water, bend, hit the piece of plastic, bend, and now you can sort of see it there, right?

522
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:37,720
Scott: Whereas this, the photons just pass through the water, they keep going straight, they hit the plastic, they keep going straight, they're just going straight through from all angles, and so you drop the thing in water and it's gone.

523
00:30:38,281 --> 00:30:51,334
Scott: Now, this company makes such a material and they advertise it as like, "Hey, you can make a cool thing to go on your desk where it looks like your company's logo is floating in water, on your office desk, you're an executive,".

524
00:30:51,414 --> 00:30:56,720
Scott: or all sorts of practical or cool marketing or otherwise uses for this technology.

525
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:02,892
Scott: But in this video promoting this, they have constructed a Rube Goldberg machine.

526
00:31:03,133 --> 00:31:06,060
Scott: Rube Goldberg machines, if you don't know, are the oldest GeekNights things of the day.

527
00:31:06,201 --> 00:31:06,266
Scott: Yep.

528
00:31:06,561 --> 00:31:08,540
Scott: We did a lot of Rube Goldberg machines over the years.

529
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,380
Rym: If you ever did Science Olympiad, it's the Mission Possible event that still exists.

530
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:34,580
Scott: And several components of the Rube Goldberg machine here, including the main marble that is running the course of the machine, are made of this material, so it appears as if this is a ghost-operated, strange Rube Goldberg machine as many things move for apparently no reason because you cannot see a good number of the objects involved.

531
00:31:35,002 --> 00:31:38,460
Scott: Whereas if they drain the water, it would look like a perfectly normal Rube Goldberg machine.

532
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,179
Scott: This is good stuff.

533
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,420
Scott: Also, getting a Rube Goldberg machine to work in water, that's already hard enough.

534
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:43,441
Scott: Right?

535
00:31:43,682 --> 00:31:44,405
Scott: So, there you go.

536
00:31:44,586 --> 00:31:44,968
Scott: Pretty cool.

537
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:47,160
Scott: And also, this channel has a lot of other cool things on it.

538
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:51,399
Rym: In the minute moment, the GeekNights Book Club book, Tale of Genji, still reading, learning stuff about Genji.

539
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,785
Scott: Yeah, as predicted, not reading that much at home.

540
00:31:54,805 --> 00:32:05,620
Scott: My Kindle on the poop plan does not work because I tend to poop and then get out because I don't have a job to avoid while I'm pooping.

541
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:08,180
Rym: Yeah, kind of the same situation, actually.

542
00:32:09,024 --> 00:32:09,759
Scott: But yeah, we'll get there.

543
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,609
Rym: I feel like I'm going to do some reading on the weekend.

544
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,898
Rym: Once it gets a little warmer, sit on my balcony.

545
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,246
Scott: Yeah, I do a lot of reading in the park.

546
00:32:17,266 --> 00:32:19,435
Scott: so if it's warm, I can get to the park.

547
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:20,500
Scott: I can read there.

548
00:32:21,281 --> 00:32:24,400
Rym: I'm getting ready for the idea that I'll just sit on my balcony a lot for a while.

549
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,673
Scott: I got a chair ready, so...

550
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,820
Rym: Otherwise, we have no cons until maybe September.

551
00:32:29,261 --> 00:32:29,626
Scott: Maybe.

552
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:30,559
Scott: Well, maybe not.

553
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,738
Rym: Yep, we'll see how things go.

554
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,705
Rym: So, we've been watching a lot of shows.

555
00:32:33,806 --> 00:32:37,860
Rym: I've watched a ton of shit, but we both have watched a bunch of Keep Your Hands Off Azakhan.

556
00:32:38,521 --> 00:32:43,759
Scott: So, yet again, is this the second GeekNights in a Row where we're talking about an anime from Science Saru?

557
00:32:44,361 --> 00:32:46,920
Rym: Science Saru is too powerful for this earth.

558
00:32:47,301 --> 00:32:51,840
Scott: Yeah, they're just making too many goddamn animes for everyone.

559
00:32:52,020 --> 00:33:00,580
Scott: If you don't know, Science Saru is the studio of Masaaki Yuasa and Friends that has produced many great works.

560
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,205
Rym: What was the Weeb Simpsons meme?

561
00:33:02,225 --> 00:33:06,499
Rym: where it was Milaz's dad just like, "I got fired because I said that Science Saru is being too

562
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:06,940
Rym: productive.".

563
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:15,480
Scott: Yeah, if you listened to the last episode we did on Ride Your Wave, you can hear us talk all about them so we don't need to repeat ourselves on that.

564
00:33:16,001 --> 00:33:19,591
Scott: But they have a TV show that is coming out right now or just came out.

565
00:33:19,651 --> 00:33:20,534
Scott: I don't know if it's done yet.

566
00:33:20,614 --> 00:33:22,900
Scott: If it is done, it was done very recently.

567
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,189
Scott: I watched the first four episodes.

568
00:33:25,229 --> 00:33:27,020
Scott: Rym watched some more than that probably.

569
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,685
Rym: I actually only watched the first four.

570
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:31,940
Rym: I started the fifth one, but then I stopped because Emily and I are gonna watch the whole thing together.

571
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:38,017
Scott: Alright, so the first thing we have to talk about in this show, Keep Your Hands Off Azakhan, is the beginning.

572
00:33:38,237 --> 00:33:39,220
Scott: The fucking opener.

573
00:33:39,602 --> 00:33:39,911
Rym: Oh yeah.

574
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,143
Scott: Jesus Christ.

575
00:33:41,203 --> 00:33:44,800
Scott: Okay, so this opener comes on, right, with this Easy Breezy song.

576
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,647
Rym: Easy Breezy.

577
00:33:45,687 --> 00:33:47,300
Rym: It's already stuck in my head on permanent loop.

578
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,772
Scott: Immediately, I basically have 100% deja vu back to kodocha.

579
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:53,320
Scott: Yeah.

580
00:33:55,701 --> 00:34:00,911
Scott: It's the same fucking song and it's a dance and it's almost very similar dance.

581
00:34:01,332 --> 00:34:04,338
Scott: The song is like the same instruments and the same key or whatever.

582
00:34:04,358 --> 00:34:05,500
Scott: I don't fucking know music theory.

583
00:34:05,982 --> 00:34:09,199
Scott: But it's the same goddamn song, the same chord progression, the same everything.

584
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:15,590
Rym: And the opening itself, the animation is just great and weird and funny.

585
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:18,955
Rym: It gave me that feeling of a lot of the anime I really liked during anime club eras.

586
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:22,860
Scott: Exactly.

587
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:28,940
Scott: There is no guarantee that a show that has a dance opener or closer will be a good show.

588
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,606
Scott: Mahoro Matic, for example, had the Mahoro Mambo as the closer.

589
00:34:32,746 --> 00:34:38,818
Scott: Not a great show, but the tradition is still long and good, right?

590
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:43,108
Scott: You got the kodocha, I think is the oldest one I know of.

591
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:47,639
Scott: Obviously, the Haru Haru Yuka is probably the biggest one.

592
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,246
Scott: And now this is the new one, the Easy Breezy.

593
00:34:50,266 --> 00:34:54,120
Scott: So that's already, you turn this show on, you see Sai and Saru.

594
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:55,725
Scott: It's like, that's good sign number one.

595
00:34:56,085 --> 00:35:00,059
Scott: Then you see a dance as the opener and you're like, that's good sign number two.

596
00:35:00,921 --> 00:35:02,229
Scott: This is guaranteed good anime.

597
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,437
Scott: I don't even need to tell you anything.

598
00:35:03,477 --> 00:35:03,860
Scott: I'm going home.

599
00:35:04,221 --> 00:35:09,380
Rym: And then the characters in the opener are goonie and weird and move weird.

600
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,447
Rym: And I got a lot of the vibe.

601
00:35:11,507 --> 00:35:14,620
Rym: It basically set off an instinct that has not set off for a long time.

602
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:15,282
Rym: An instinct from back.

603
00:35:15,303 --> 00:35:19,440
Rym: when we ran the RIT Anime Club, my brain said, we have to show this at the club.

604
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:19,935
Rym: Oh, yeah.

605
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,239
Rym: This show would have been one of those shows.

606
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,249
Scott: So here's the summary of the plot of this show, right?

607
00:35:25,309 --> 00:35:28,118
Scott: So there is a high school, but it's sort of a...

608
00:35:29,162 --> 00:35:32,260
Rym: It's set much like Madoka Magica in a near future.

609
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:40,100
Scott: Yeah, it's definitely a sort of the architecture and the geography of the high school is weird, like there's water nearby.

610
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:45,920
Scott: It seems like almost like a fantastic, a semi fantastical anime town, right?

611
00:35:47,141 --> 00:35:48,970
Scott: Where it's like, you know, the high school is in the town.

612
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:51,240
Scott: It's not just like a high school separated from everything else.

613
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:52,644
Scott: Right.

614
00:35:52,664 --> 00:35:52,864
Scott: Yeah.

615
00:35:53,285 --> 00:35:55,471
Scott: There's definitely town scenes and things like that.

616
00:35:55,511 --> 00:35:58,900
Scott: It's not all in the high school, but the architecture of the high school is strange.

617
00:35:59,020 --> 00:35:59,968
Scott: It has a lot of buildings.

618
00:36:00,169 --> 00:36:01,520
Scott: They're all stacked up vertically.

619
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,400
Rym: It feels like near future, like post some climate change problems.

620
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:08,000
Scott: Yeah, it's definitely unique in some ways.

621
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,949
Rym: And there's a lot of environmental storytelling around that.

622
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:11,859
Rym: Like just one random thing that I want to point out.

623
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:18,840
Rym: Like the schools, like the teachers in the school, their offices are clearly in what used to be a pool.

624
00:36:19,222 --> 00:36:19,403
Rym: Yeah.

625
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:22,380
Rym: Like specifically they've turned this pool into office space.

626
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:23,081
Scott: Yeah.

627
00:36:23,102 --> 00:36:27,580
Scott: So anyway, then you've got, uh, the architecture is weird.

628
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:31,440
Scott: The social environment of the school seems pretty typical.

629
00:36:31,541 --> 00:36:34,140
Scott: Japanese high school with a little bit of anime craziness.

630
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:42,240
Scott: It's not as crazy as some other animes out there where high school doesn't even happen and no one goes to class.

631
00:36:42,761 --> 00:36:42,922
Rym: Right.

632
00:36:42,942 --> 00:36:48,220
Rym: But it's like, you know what it feels like, especially this episode where we saw the student council for the first time.

633
00:36:48,701 --> 00:36:54,440
Rym: It feels like the way it felt to be running clubs in a college or high school.

634
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:04,420
Scott: It feels to me more like what you see in, um, El Hazard or even though the school there, the school scenes are brief or, um, the witch one.

635
00:37:05,762 --> 00:37:08,997
Rym: There's a lot of anime that could apply to the one with the three witches sky tie.

636
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:09,901
Scott: Yes.

637
00:37:09,921 --> 00:37:10,563
Scott: Right.

638
00:37:10,905 --> 00:37:15,500
Scott: Where the school, it's still a high school environment, but it's just a little bit crazy.

639
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:16,824
Scott: It's not Cromartie crazy.

640
00:37:17,486 --> 00:37:21,820
Scott: It's just like regular high school with a dash of Cromartie, like a little sprinkle.

641
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,404
Rym: So there's a dash of crazy.

642
00:37:23,625 --> 00:37:28,620
Rym: There's a dash of like goon characters, like background idiots doing background idiot stuff.

643
00:37:29,501 --> 00:37:31,452
Rym: Like the club that was asking for the weird thing.

644
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:33,441
Scott: Right.

645
00:37:33,582 --> 00:37:34,264
Scott: You know what it's like?

646
00:37:34,344 --> 00:37:39,000
Scott: It's sort of like, um, uh, Studio Trigger with the witches.

647
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:40,777
Rym: Little Witch Academia?

648
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:41,341
Scott: Yes.

649
00:37:41,361 --> 00:37:42,346
Scott: Only without the fantasy.

650
00:37:42,849 --> 00:37:44,820
Scott: Remove the fantasy from Little Witch Academia.

651
00:37:45,041 --> 00:37:47,840
Scott: But it's the same sort of social aspect to that school.

652
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:48,140
Rym: Yeah.

653
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:55,860
Rym: But couple it with an environment that is clearly set in a near future where things are different for future reasons, but not that far off.

654
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:56,301
Scott: All right.

655
00:37:56,341 --> 00:37:59,393
Scott: So there are students at this school, but really we only care about three of them.

656
00:37:59,474 --> 00:38:01,020
Scott: The three of them, I forget all their names.

657
00:38:02,301 --> 00:38:07,500
Scott: The main, the main ish one, cause that's like the first one you're introduced to, even though they're all sort of equally main.

658
00:38:08,603 --> 00:38:13,920
Scott: Uh, they're all girls is sort of like this crazy anime nerd, right?

659
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:20,840
Scott: Who loves drawing mechs and is totally nuts and is really good at drawing up into weird shit.

660
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,880
Rym: Like likes to explore the weird town and has a wild animation, imagination.

661
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,145
Scott: Not everybody.

662
00:38:27,427 --> 00:38:28,312
Scott: Um, right.

663
00:38:28,393 --> 00:38:29,539
Scott: And that's like the main character.

664
00:38:30,262 --> 00:38:35,900
Scott: Their best friend is the tall, skinny, serious character who's sort of serious.

665
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,244
Scott: They care a lot about money.

666
00:38:37,645 --> 00:38:37,926
Scott: Yup.

667
00:38:37,966 --> 00:38:38,186
Scott: Right.

668
00:38:38,407 --> 00:38:43,120
Scott: They have a more of a head on their shoulders, but they're also sort of, uh, greedy.

669
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,783
Rym: Yup.

670
00:38:45,044 --> 00:38:46,768
Scott: And, uh, manipulative.

671
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:50,960
Rym: They remind me of a lot of the, there's characters like this in like every old anime.

672
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:56,080
Scott: But not stupid and still has, you know, good, mostly good intentions, right?

673
00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:00,900
Scott: The similar, they come across a lot like Susie from Little Witch Academia, the poison one.

674
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,867
Scott: How do I finally remember the character's name?

675
00:39:02,887 --> 00:39:04,714
Scott: Yeah.

676
00:39:04,734 --> 00:39:05,476
Rym: What's, what's her name?

677
00:39:05,536 --> 00:39:06,520
Rym: from Ronma one half.

678
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:09,530
Rym: God, I just spent a while feeling old here.

679
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:10,453
Rym: Where are the old men?

680
00:39:10,554 --> 00:39:12,160
Rym: Oh, who is the character in that show?

681
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,887
Rym: Was that Tenchi Moya?

682
00:39:14,731 --> 00:39:16,258
Rym: I think that was Tenchi Moya.

683
00:39:16,419 --> 00:39:16,660
Scott: Okay.

684
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:23,380
Scott: And the third character is the plot of the first episode is sort of those two characters bringing this third one into their fold, right?

685
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:29,180
Scott: They're at the anime club and this third character gets chased out of the anime club by men in black.

686
00:39:29,561 --> 00:39:31,505
Scott: Sort of a, you know, ridiculous scene.

687
00:39:31,866 --> 00:39:44,600
Scott: And this third character is like a famous celebrity child model actor person who's at the school and loves anime and is mad rich and has mad rich parents and is like famous and, you know, whatever.

688
00:39:45,801 --> 00:39:51,940
Scott: Uh, and they care, they like anime a lot and they're good at drawing, but their parents don't want to let them join the anime club.

689
00:39:52,381 --> 00:39:59,200
Scott: So like their personal security guards who are like, you know, taking care of them, uh, you know, came after them, right?

690
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,340
Rym: You have to get them out of the anime club, right?

691
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:12,260
Scott: So these two other main characters are at the anime club, saw this, uh, and ended up through stuff ending up teaming up and making the three person team that forms the main three characters of the show.

692
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:18,260
Rym: Two artist animators and the level headed and perfectly reasonable producer pulling it all together.

693
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:18,681
Scott: Yes.

694
00:40:18,761 --> 00:40:22,711
Scott: The three friends, their relationship and their character aspects, right?

695
00:40:23,052 --> 00:40:26,280
Scott: Perfectly match what's going on in an animation studio.

696
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:29,566
Scott: One person represents the management, right?

697
00:40:29,586 --> 00:40:36,280
Scott: Uh, needing to get things done on time, needing money, needing to stay in budget, wanting to actually get shit done.

698
00:40:36,821 --> 00:40:41,829
Scott: And the other two people are imaginative, creative types, right?

699
00:40:42,029 --> 00:40:48,260
Scott: Who need to be, you know, they have a lot of drive to get things done, but they want to do it their way, right?

700
00:40:48,581 --> 00:40:50,064
Scott: And they have two different ways, right?

701
00:40:50,205 --> 00:40:56,660
Scott: One is the crazy sort of Mecca artist and the other one, the rich one, the character artist is the character artist, right?

702
00:40:56,740 --> 00:41:04,231
Scott: Who wants to, you know, make the animations really detailed and have lots of frames and, you know, draw like real life?

703
00:41:04,392 --> 00:41:09,940
Scott: or is the crazy one wants to draw mechs and backgrounds and environments, right?

704
00:41:11,042 --> 00:41:16,711
Rym: And basically the first four episodes, like the arc to get you started on the show is just, they form the club.

705
00:41:17,051 --> 00:41:22,500
Rym: If there's club politics to form clubs, they work hard and they basically make their daikon animation.

706
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:22,860
Scott: Right.

707
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,226
Scott: They couldn't form an anime club because there was one.

708
00:41:25,246 --> 00:41:26,490
Scott: So they formed a film club.

709
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:29,437
Scott: The anime club in the show is really just like our anime club.

710
00:41:29,497 --> 00:41:30,540
Scott: It was about watching anime.

711
00:41:31,102 --> 00:41:34,553
Scott: Their club is about producing anime, right?

712
00:41:34,693 --> 00:41:36,760
Scott: So that, and their club is the Eizouken.

713
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:37,740
Rym: Yep.

714
00:41:38,061 --> 00:41:41,988
Rym: They, they lie and say they're a generic film club to get their club license.

715
00:41:42,028 --> 00:41:48,340
Rym: and now the clock is ticking to be so impressive that the school can't just like revoke their charter because they're not making films.

716
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:48,780
Scott: Right.

717
00:41:48,821 --> 00:41:50,806
Scott: Cause even though one person is rich, they need this.

718
00:41:51,107 --> 00:41:52,230
Scott: They can't really use that money.

719
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:55,540
Scott: They need the school's money to produce the anime they want to make.

720
00:41:56,121 --> 00:41:59,505
Scott: And what the real conceit of the show is not that main plot.

721
00:42:00,005 --> 00:42:11,460
Scott: The real conceit of the show is that much in the way that say an antenna or other shows have a episodic structure where there is sort of like a battle in each episode.

722
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:11,880
Rym: Right.

723
00:42:12,461 --> 00:42:24,055
Scott: In this show, basically in each episode, there is sort of a point at which the characters cross over into the animation that they are making.

724
00:42:24,075 --> 00:42:26,057
Scott: And it's like, it's all anime.

725
00:42:26,077 --> 00:42:28,600
Scott: You're watching an anime, you at home, the real person.

726
00:42:29,061 --> 00:42:29,301
Scott: Right.

727
00:42:29,562 --> 00:42:39,300
Scott: But the anime that you're watching those characters in their world, their world crosses over with the world of the animation that they're making or have already made.

728
00:42:39,841 --> 00:42:40,041
Scott: Right.

729
00:42:40,081 --> 00:42:41,623
Scott: And that is sort of like the dual.

730
00:42:42,204 --> 00:42:42,384
Scott: Right.

731
00:42:42,404 --> 00:42:55,560
Rym: That happens in each episode, clearly representing on one hand, usually the third character being dragged into their like imagination and then kind of implicitly getting excited about the idea, even if they ostensibly are.

732
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,703
Scott: Also other people being dragged in.

733
00:42:57,743 --> 00:42:57,963
Scott: Right.

734
00:42:58,003 --> 00:43:03,189
Scott: And they're trying to demonstrate the power of like, this is what animation is.

735
00:43:03,209 --> 00:43:11,840
Scott: You're you're inflicting your imagination and upon others and you make it real for them with the power of many drawings.

736
00:43:12,562 --> 00:43:20,080
Rym: But coupled with like the actual, but the actual process they show in the show, like gets pretty detailed and pretty realistic.

737
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:20,740
Scott: Right.

738
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:24,243
Scott: So usually you see this a lot in pretty much every medium of art.

739
00:43:24,303 --> 00:43:24,524
Scott: Right.

740
00:43:24,804 --> 00:43:27,186
Scott: Paintings of people painting things.

741
00:43:27,426 --> 00:43:27,627
Scott: Right.

742
00:43:27,727 --> 00:43:29,508
Scott: Songs about making music.

743
00:43:29,608 --> 00:43:29,849
Scott: Right.

744
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:32,371
Scott: I want to rock and roll all night and party every day.

745
00:43:32,411 --> 00:43:32,611
Scott: Right.

746
00:43:32,952 --> 00:43:35,394
Scott: Movies about making fucking movies, singing in the rain.

747
00:43:35,454 --> 00:43:35,734
Scott: Right.

748
00:43:36,795 --> 00:43:38,437
Scott: Books about fucking authors.

749
00:43:38,757 --> 00:43:39,898
Scott: It's too many of those.

750
00:43:40,198 --> 00:43:41,760
Scott: Video games about video games.

751
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,726
Scott: There's actually not as many of those as there could be, but there are still more than zero.

752
00:43:46,806 --> 00:43:50,571
Rym: But a lot of the anime about making about complex to give me fucking started.

753
00:43:50,831 --> 00:43:51,832
Scott: manga about manga.

754
00:43:51,852 --> 00:43:57,540
Rym: I just read one the other day, but a lot of them focus a lot more on the actual character drama.

755
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:03,725
Rym: And they kind of gloss over or put very scant detail into the actual like thing that they're addressing.

756
00:44:03,885 --> 00:44:04,846
Scott: Anime about anime.

757
00:44:04,866 --> 00:44:06,087
Scott: This animation runner, Kuromi.

758
00:44:06,267 --> 00:44:06,868
Scott: Right.

759
00:44:07,048 --> 00:44:08,689
Scott: There's tons of these.

760
00:44:08,849 --> 00:44:10,390
Scott: So if you're going to do one of those.

761
00:44:10,651 --> 00:44:10,811
Scott: Right.

762
00:44:10,911 --> 00:44:13,653
Scott: A thing about the medium that it is in.

763
00:44:14,214 --> 00:44:14,454
Scott: Right.

764
00:44:14,674 --> 00:44:22,100
Scott: There is a high bar to get over to, you know, make that acceptable and not just be another one of those.

765
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:30,348
Scott: And the one way you can do it is just by executing on such a high level that it's like, oh, you're you're the best song about songs ever.

766
00:44:30,428 --> 00:44:32,530
Scott: So it's okay for you to be a song about songs.

767
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:33,651
Rym: This is a tribute.

768
00:44:34,272 --> 00:44:35,393
Scott: Right.

769
00:44:35,734 --> 00:44:37,976
Scott: The other way to do it is to do what's going on here.

770
00:44:38,016 --> 00:44:41,420
Scott: This isn't, you know, it might be the best anime about anime.

771
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:41,760
Scott: Maybe.

772
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:42,940
Scott: I don't know.

773
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,461
Scott: Regardless of that, the angle on this is different.

774
00:44:44,481 --> 00:44:47,103
Scott: It's only slightly meta, you know, detailing about the production of anime.

775
00:44:47,123 --> 00:44:47,343
Scott: Right.

776
00:44:47,383 --> 00:44:49,645
Scott: The message is like, you know, how animators feel about anime.

777
00:44:49,665 --> 00:44:49,905
Scott: Right.

778
00:44:49,925 --> 00:44:50,085
Scott: Yeah.

779
00:44:50,105 --> 00:44:50,545
Scott: But also it is.

780
00:44:50,565 --> 00:44:53,167
Scott: It's good about the like the nuance of the animators want to do one thing.

781
00:44:53,187 --> 00:44:54,328
Scott: They don't even fully agree with each other.

782
00:44:54,348 --> 00:44:56,089
Scott: And then there's budget and other constraints.

783
00:44:56,109 --> 00:44:57,270
Scott: And how does that feel about anime.

784
00:44:57,290 --> 00:44:57,750
Scott: Right.

785
00:44:57,770 --> 00:44:59,051
Scott: And how does that feel about anime.

786
00:44:59,071 --> 00:44:59,211
Scott: Right.

787
00:44:59,231 --> 00:45:00,612
Scott: And how does that feel about anime.

788
00:45:00,632 --> 00:45:00,732
Scott: Right.

789
00:45:00,752 --> 00:45:01,593
Scott: And how does that feel about anime.

790
00:45:01,613 --> 00:45:01,753
Scott: Right.

791
00:45:01,773 --> 00:45:02,894
Rym: And how does that feel about anime.

792
00:45:02,934 --> 00:45:03,034
Rym: Right.

793
00:45:03,054 --> 00:45:04,035
Rym: And how does that feel about anime.

794
00:45:04,055 --> 00:45:04,155
Rym: Right.

795
00:45:04,175 --> 00:45:05,175
Rym: And how does that feel about anime.

796
00:45:05,195 --> 00:45:05,296
Rym: Right.

797
00:45:05,316 --> 00:45:06,616
Rym: And how does that feel about anime.

798
00:45:06,636 --> 00:45:06,737
Rym: Right.

799
00:45:06,797 --> 00:45:07,517
Rym: And how does that feel about anime.

800
00:45:07,537 --> 00:45:07,637
Rym: Right.

801
00:45:07,657 --> 00:45:08,478
Rym: And how does that feel about anime.

802
00:45:08,498 --> 00:45:08,618
Rym: Right.

803
00:45:08,678 --> 00:45:09,719
Rym: And how does that feel about anime.

804
00:45:09,739 --> 00:45:09,839
Rym: Right.

805
00:45:09,879 --> 00:45:10,779
Rym: And how does that feel about anime.

806
00:45:10,799 --> 00:45:10,899
Rym: Right.

807
00:45:10,919 --> 00:45:11,760
Rym: And how does that feel about anime.

808
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:11,880
Rym: Right.

809
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:15,248
Rym: And how does the finished idea that comes to a screen evolve.

810
00:45:15,509 --> 00:45:18,777
Rym: And how it often ends up radically different from what the animators actually wanted.

811
00:45:19,218 --> 00:45:20,160
Rym: And that's just how things work.

812
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:20,480
Scott: Right.

813
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:26,652
Scott: Well, but also it's, you know, but that's, it's, that's there, but it's about the power of the animation itself.

814
00:45:26,752 --> 00:45:26,892
Scott: Right.

815
00:45:26,912 --> 00:45:28,255
Scott: Which the other anime about?

816
00:45:28,375 --> 00:45:30,860
Scott: anime are not about the power of anime.

817
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,486
Scott: Animation runner Kuromi isn't about the power of animation.

818
00:45:33,546 --> 00:45:36,514
Scott: Otaku no Video isn't about the power of animation.

819
00:45:36,554 --> 00:45:38,960
Scott: What makes that medium strong and effective.

820
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:42,508
Rym: And the first arc builds up to here's our fucking Daikon animation.

821
00:45:42,548 --> 00:45:45,154
Rym: And we're just going to watch it in the show.

822
00:45:45,355 --> 00:45:45,535
Rym: Right.

823
00:45:45,575 --> 00:45:46,698
Rym: In the context of the show.

824
00:45:46,958 --> 00:45:47,740
Scott: And it's great.

825
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:54,527
Scott: This anime is literally illustrating animations, you know, having literal power.

826
00:45:55,188 --> 00:45:55,528
Scott: Right.

827
00:45:55,869 --> 00:46:00,454
Scott: To sort of inflict their, you know, worlds upon people.

828
00:46:00,954 --> 00:46:01,295
Scott: Right.

829
00:46:01,755 --> 00:46:06,320
Scott: In a, in a fantastic and supernatural possible way.

830
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,443
Rym: You trigger someone's imagination and they're off.

831
00:46:08,704 --> 00:46:09,004
Scott: Right.

832
00:46:10,166 --> 00:46:19,300
Rym: I am really enjoying watching the producer get sort of dragged into this nonsense reluctantly, but not as reluctantly like they protest a lot, but they're kind of into it in the end.

833
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:24,085
Scott: I'm actually kind of liking how when they bring in.

834
00:46:24,345 --> 00:46:30,453
Scott: So I thought that like they were mostly good because the war, the other stuff outside of the three characters is not brought in very much.

835
00:46:30,874 --> 00:46:31,054
Scott: Right.

836
00:46:31,074 --> 00:46:35,380
Scott: It has not a lot of screen time, but like they're actually giving it more than I thought.

837
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:38,525
Rym: And like the teacher seems like he's like, the teacher's really trying to help them.

838
00:46:38,645 --> 00:46:39,346
Rym: Right.

839
00:46:39,386 --> 00:46:41,870
Rym: Like the beard teacher, my beard is heavy again.

840
00:46:42,011 --> 00:46:42,271
Scott: Yes.

841
00:46:42,311 --> 00:46:43,212
Scott: That beard teacher.

842
00:46:43,253 --> 00:46:45,296
Scott: Like I thought he was just going to be like there and gone.

843
00:46:45,336 --> 00:46:47,880
Scott: It's like, no, the beard teacher actually seems like he's a thing.

844
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:49,182
Scott: He's more than he's doing.

845
00:46:49,222 --> 00:46:51,366
Scott: more than the club advisor and your pedal is.

846
00:46:51,486 --> 00:46:53,550
Rym: He's doing more than any club advisor we ever had did.

847
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:53,951
Scott: Right.

848
00:46:53,971 --> 00:46:55,874
Scott: The club advisor and your pedal isn't do jack shit.

849
00:46:55,895 --> 00:46:57,718
Scott: He's like just there because they have to have one.

850
00:46:57,738 --> 00:46:58,800
Rym: or like the student council.

851
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,502
Rym: I hope they come back because they're great.

852
00:47:01,682 --> 00:47:07,247
Scott: It's like the fact that they decided to make character designs for the student council shows me that they're going to be real characters.

853
00:47:07,307 --> 00:47:07,527
Scott: Right.

854
00:47:07,647 --> 00:47:07,867
Scott: Yep.

855
00:47:07,968 --> 00:47:09,309
Scott: That have meaning and whatever.

856
00:47:09,609 --> 00:47:12,331
Rym: And also like the show is just really well, like the animation is great.

857
00:47:12,651 --> 00:47:13,872
Rym: The voice acting is great.

858
00:47:13,892 --> 00:47:14,313
Scott: Of course.

859
00:47:14,933 --> 00:47:17,255
Rym: The show is funny as you thought they were going to do.

860
00:47:17,696 --> 00:47:23,060
Rym: But like this show, I have laughed more at this than most comedy anime I've seen in a while.

861
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:23,400
Rym: Yeah.

862
00:47:23,661 --> 00:47:24,021
Rym: Like you

863
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:41,180
Scott: can tell what's happening in this show is that the imaginations of the real animators working on it right through this mechanism that they have created are able to take their completely crazy, you know, out of context ideas and insert them into the show as the characters ideas.

864
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,903
Scott: This characters then draw those ideas, which are then brought to life in the show.

865
00:47:46,504 --> 00:47:46,724
Scott: Right.

866
00:47:46,784 --> 00:47:48,345
Scott: Not in, not really brought to life.

867
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:49,105
Scott: Right.

868
00:47:49,486 --> 00:47:55,410
Scott: And so it's like, ha ha, we have created this structure by whereby we can do all this crazy stuff that we want to do.

869
00:47:55,870 --> 00:47:59,913
Scott: And it's as it's, but pass it off as crazy stuff someone else wants to do.

870
00:48:00,253 --> 00:48:02,014
Scott: And then we get to draw what we draw.

871
00:48:02,274 --> 00:48:10,720
Rym: But like one of my favorite scenes, I think it's even in the second episode is they do the whole like into the other anime world thing and they draw all this stuff and they're flying around and then it zooms back out.

872
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:11,681
Rym: Like very carefully to.

873
00:48:12,082 --> 00:48:19,714
Rym: they're standing there and they literally have one piece of paper with one image on it, just sitting on top of another piece of paper with another image.

874
00:48:20,015 --> 00:48:23,320
Rym: And all that in their imagination came from them looking at this one picture.

875
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:23,721
Scott: Right.

876
00:48:23,741 --> 00:48:33,040
Scott: But like, you know, another high school anime that say wanted to have a tank in it would have to hang, you know, be like, all right, well, there's a. they're trained, their students are training for this war right here.

877
00:48:33,381 --> 00:48:42,200
Scott: They can have one episode can have a tank and the next episode can have, you know, playing the producer on boards, even like, look, we're cutting the plot, just draw the tank and the machete girl.

878
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,403
Rym: Yeah, no plot.

879
00:48:43,863 --> 00:48:45,587
Scott: But it's like but it's like.

880
00:48:45,607 --> 00:48:51,500
Scott: the point is every episode of this show going forward, they'll be able to draw whatever crazy shit they want.

881
00:48:51,781 --> 00:48:51,982
Scott: Right.

882
00:48:52,022 --> 00:48:55,977
Scott: Whatever those characters are imagining and whatever they want to draw in their anime.

883
00:48:56,419 --> 00:48:56,660
Scott: Right.

884
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,766
Scott: The people who are making the show in real life can now draw all sorts of crazy stuff.

885
00:49:01,787 --> 00:49:12,280
Scott: They can draw some romance, they can draw some comedy, they can draw anything because they've made a you know, the thing that's consistent made a frame of these three characters and this school.

886
00:49:13,181 --> 00:49:21,800
Scott: And that frame is around a blank anime canvas because the characters are making an anime and now they can just put whatever they want their episode to episode.

887
00:49:22,141 --> 00:49:24,605
Rym: But it helps that the three characters are just great.

888
00:49:24,845 --> 00:49:33,080
Scott: Like they're really good, distinct, unique, quirky characters that despite being, you know, characters you see in a lot of anime right there.

889
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:33,862
Rym: Well, they're done well.

890
00:49:33,882 --> 00:49:40,520
Rym: They have a lot of crooks, slightly so they have a lot more subtle bits going on that made them much more complete than similar characters from other shows.

891
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:47,260
Rym: Like the fact that the main girl, when she gets nervous, kind of talks like an old grandpa and like things like that.

892
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:55,860
Scott: The voice actor definitely is, is not what you would typically assign for, uh, you know, a female high school girl character.

893
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:58,307
Rym: Like I'm into the show and after I'm just gonna watch the whole thing.

894
00:49:58,347 --> 00:50:01,316
Rym: Like I do not need any prompting to finish the show pretty quickly.

895
00:50:01,336 --> 00:50:02,760
Rym: It's not even all out yet.

896
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:03,767
Scott: Nope.

897
00:50:03,787 --> 00:50:04,859
Scott: How many episodes is it going to be?

898
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:06,864
Rym: I'm not sure actually.

899
00:50:06,884 --> 00:50:10,313
Rym: I want to say it was like a typical 26 ish show.

900
00:50:10,333 --> 00:50:11,817
Rym: There are 11 out so far.

901
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:13,603
Scott: Okay.

902
00:50:14,148 --> 00:50:15,400
Scott: I don't know how many there's going to be total.

903
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:16,091
Rym: Yup.

904
00:50:16,274 --> 00:50:16,599
Rym: I don't know.

905
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:21,260
Scott: I've seen four, so it doesn't seem like a reason not to watch the rest.

906
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:21,520
Rym: Yup.

907
00:50:21,541 --> 00:50:24,059
Rym: And episode 11 just came out two days ago.

908
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:25,002
Scott: All right.

909
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:26,789
Scott: So it's on Crunchyroll.

910
00:50:26,829 --> 00:50:29,760
Scott: It's probably on somewhere else too, but Crunchyroll seems like the place.

911
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:34,579
Rym: If you haven't been watching a lot of anime lately, like you could do worse to come back into anime by watching this.

912
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:40,336
Scott: You're gonna be stuck at home if you're really so bored and you really have nothing to do that you're listening to fucking GeekNights.

913
00:50:40,376 --> 00:50:40,917
Scott: Holy shit.

914
00:50:40,937 --> 00:50:41,920
Scott: What a waste of your time.

915
00:50:42,261 --> 00:50:46,052
Scott: You could have watched one or two episodes of this in the time it took you to watch GeekNights.

916
00:50:46,112 --> 00:50:46,934
Scott: Mistakes were made.

917
00:50:46,954 --> 00:50:48,900
Scott: Go correct your mistakes now.

918
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:50,000
Rym: You can watch them at the same time.

919
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:51,390
Scott: Do not listen to another GeekNights.

920
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:52,740
Scott: Instead, watch this show.

921
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:54,859
Rym: All right sad pyro and snow.

922
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:01,696
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

923
00:51:01,756 --> 00:51:06,730
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

924
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:12,150
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

925
00:51:12,391 --> 00:51:15,078
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

926
00:51:15,218 --> 00:51:19,790
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

927

928
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:27,680
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

929
00:51:27,881 --> 00:51:30,770
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

930
00:51:32,452 --> 00:52:00,390
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights are...

931
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:03,268
Rym: And now, I leave you with...

932
00:52:04,012 --> 00:52:07,887
Scott: I have created 23 individual illustrations in the past 6 hours, 27 minutes.

933
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:10,003
Scott: Happy birthday, Worf.

934
00:52:11,150 --> 00:52:12,769
Rym: Data's painting is making me dizzy.
