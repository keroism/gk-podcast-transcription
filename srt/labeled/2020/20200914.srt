1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,128
Rym: It's Monday, September 14th, 2020.

2
00:00:10,128 --> 00:00:10,390
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,245 --> 00:00:13,620
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,427
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,467 --> 00:00:21,860
Rym: Tonight, we're talking about software updates, both from the consumer side and the publisher side.

6
00:00:23,221 --> 00:00:24,238
Scott: Let's do this!

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,494
Rym: So, uh, really hoped, like, I had a plan years ago.

8
00:00:28,554 --> 00:00:31,364
Rym: When I moved to the city, I was like, "Well, I'll never have to own a car

9
00:00:31,404 --> 00:00:31,665
Rym: again.".

10
00:00:32,688 --> 00:00:41,100
Rym: And I made this pseudo-vow, like, my goal in life was to never own a car again unless it was a full self-driving car that I could just, like, call.

11
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,760
Rym: It would come and pick me up and drive me places.

12
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:49,632
Scott: Even that kind of car I would not buy, nor if there was such a car, it would be no good unless it was municipal.

13
00:00:49,672 --> 00:00:51,020
Scott: And even then, it wouldn't be that great.

14
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,359
Rym: But, you know, the reality of America, those are things that are not easily fixed, and there's a lot of places you can't get without a car.

15
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:57,366
Scott: Too bad.

16
00:00:57,428 --> 00:00:58,080
Scott: Fuck those places.

17
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,860
Rym: Yeah, most places on Earth.

18
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,018
Scott: Yeah, fuck 'em.

19
00:01:01,381 --> 00:01:06,400
Rym: Okay, uh, I recall you've taken a certain car to conventions in the past.

20
00:01:09,306 --> 00:01:10,639
Scott: Uh, yeah, this car's gone, bye-bye.

21
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:27,208
Rym: Okay, so, I guess you'll never want to ride, not that I would ever drive this car to a convention, but basically, we got a car for the sole purpose of being able to, like, do outdoor things until COVID calms down, because there's really, like, I'm not willing to take mass transit, like, that's not safe right now.

22
00:01:27,268 --> 00:01:35,780
Rym: I don't really want to take mass transit, but there's no way to get to those places.

23
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,200
Rym: Like, I can't bike upstate in the middle of winter.

24
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,239
Scott: Maybe you should just not do those things.

25
00:01:40,621 --> 00:01:41,650
Rym: No, I want to go outside.

26
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,820
Rym: I want to be able to continue the exercise.

27
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,156
Rym: Oh, you want to?

28
00:01:44,216 --> 00:01:44,439
Scott: Oh, okay.

29
00:01:46,385 --> 00:01:48,319
Rym: Also, there's no way to get to those places.

30
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,795
Scott: You're not going to sacrifice like the rest of us, you know?

31
00:01:49,815 --> 00:01:50,742
Scott: Just be like, "Oh, you know what?

32
00:01:50,782 --> 00:01:51,405
Scott: I got money.

33
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:52,249
Scott: Fuck the rest of you.

34
00:01:52,269 --> 00:01:54,640
Scott: I'm going to go skiing in a pandemic.

35
00:01:54,901 --> 00:01:55,664
Scott: I don't care.

36
00:01:55,684 --> 00:01:57,212
Scott: Not good.

37
00:01:57,232 --> 00:01:58,076
Scott: I'm not willing to give up

38
00:01:58,157 --> 00:01:58,599
Scott: anything.".

39
00:01:58,921 --> 00:02:00,060
Rym: Hey, I mean, you're not biking.

40
00:02:01,782 --> 00:02:03,399
Scott: Yeah, on the bike I already owned.

41
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,672
Rym: Yeah, but also, there's a lot of other reasons.

42
00:02:06,712 --> 00:02:10,620
Rym: we'll use it just for this purpose, and the plan is to basically give it away at the end of the thing.

43
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:22,523
Rym: But when I rented a one-way car to get to the place to get the car, the interesting part was that, on one hand, the car rental places have really, like, changed their thing.

44
00:02:22,563 --> 00:02:27,146
Rym: It was, like, this pretty well done, like, you don't interact with humans, like, completely contactless.

45
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:35,705
Rym: Like, the pandemic almost forced them to do the things they should have done all along, but on the other hand, because no one's renting cars, they didn't just give me a normal car.

46
00:02:36,308 --> 00:02:37,192
Rym: They don't have a lot of cars.

47
00:02:37,212 --> 00:02:41,147
Rym: Like, they're trying to get cars out of their space, and it was a one-way rental.

48
00:02:41,508 --> 00:02:43,514
Rym: They gave me this monster car.

49
00:02:43,575 --> 00:02:47,400
Rym: This car is, like, it should be banned, this car that I had to drive.

50
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:47,862
Scott: Of course.

51
00:02:47,942 --> 00:02:52,060
Scott: Most of the cars that are, you know, allowed on the road in America should be banned.

52
00:02:52,321 --> 00:02:55,410
Rym: This car, it was like this Cadillac SUV.

53
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:59,324
Rym: The top of the hood, like, came up to my shoulders in front of it.

54
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:00,912
Rym: I had to pick it up, like, at night.

55
00:03:01,354 --> 00:03:02,017
Rym: They just gave it to me.

56
00:03:02,037 --> 00:03:05,800
Rym: They charged me, like, the same rate as, like, the shitty car I actually wanted to rent.

57
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:09,480
Scott: That's why, if you're gonna rent a car, if you really have to, there's no alternative.

58
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,079
Rym: Put in the buy to get the shitty car.

59
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:19,877
Scott: Always pick the lowest, cheapest option, because if you go there and they don't have it, you just get some ridiculous car and you pay the one that you chose.

60
00:03:19,897 --> 00:03:21,543
Scott: You don't pay based on the car you get.

61
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:29,569
Scott: It's not like, "Oh, you chose, you know, Fred Flintstone car, and we've only got Formula One

62
00:03:29,649 --> 00:03:30,130
Scott: car.".

63
00:03:30,652 --> 00:03:32,920
Scott: You get Formula One car at Fred Flintstone price.

64
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,109
Scott: They can't be like, "No, no car for you,".

65
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,961
Scott: and they can't be like, "You gotta pay Formula One price.

66
00:03:37,981 --> 00:03:38,444
Scott: That's all we've

67
00:03:38,464 --> 00:03:38,665
Scott: got.".

68
00:03:39,067 --> 00:03:41,320
Scott: You get Fred Flintstone, you get F1 at Flintstone price.

69
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,680
Rym: So, years ago, I even ran into a place that- Always choose Flintstone.

70
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:52,597
Rym: They pulled a bait-and-switch scam where, when you go to pick up the car, they have in front of the rental place this tiny e-car.

71
00:03:52,657 --> 00:03:56,820
Rym: You know those tiny, tiny almost fake-looking cars that seat two people and have a tiny trunk?

72
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:06,978
Rym: They have that out, and they're like, "Oh, this is the only compact car we have, but tell you what, for a dollar more a day, I'll upgrade you to this luxury car

73
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:07,620
Rym: instead.".

74
00:04:07,701 --> 00:04:09,292
Scott: I say, "I'll take that tiny two-car.

75
00:04:09,373 --> 00:04:09,856
Scott: Yes, that looks

76
00:04:09,876 --> 00:04:10,380
Scott: awesome.".

77
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:21,540
Rym: So, we tried to take the tiny two-car, and if we actually took it, it would have ruined their scam, so they wouldn't give it to us, and they were like, "Well, the car isn't actually that safe,".

78
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:22,487
Rym: and they were like, "So, why?

79
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:23,797
Rym: You're gonna give us a car that's not

80
00:04:23,878 --> 00:04:24,100
Rym: safe?".

81
00:04:24,362 --> 00:04:25,973
Rym: And they didn't know how to deal with the situation.

82
00:04:26,013 --> 00:04:27,999
Rym: I guess it had never happened at any point.

83
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,268
Scott: And I'd be like, "Yes, that's the car I want.

84
00:04:30,288 --> 00:04:31,716
Scott: I actually want that car more.

85
00:04:31,777 --> 00:04:34,359
Scott: If I have to have a car, I want that one more than any of these

86
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:34,500
Scott: ones.".

87
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:40,974
Rym: We opened the trunk to start putting stuff into it, and then the guy freaked out, and eventually was like, "All right, here, take this luxury car.

88
00:04:41,095 --> 00:04:41,960
Rym: Discount rate, whatever.

89
00:04:42,162 --> 00:04:42,568
Rym: Please go.

90
00:04:43,055 --> 00:04:43,258
Rym: Please

91
00:04:43,299 --> 00:04:43,400
Rym: leave.".

92
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:48,818
Rym: And they gave us a really nice car for like $20 a day because we called them on their scam.

93
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:52,234
Scott: Why not let you have that little car, though?

94
00:04:52,254 --> 00:04:53,480
Scott: I guess they need it for their scam.

95
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,413
Rym: Yeah, because they only have one of that little car.

96
00:04:55,453 --> 00:04:56,299
Rym: They clearly needed it.

97
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,415
Scott: So, basically, you could have taken the car.

98
00:04:58,435 --> 00:05:02,500
Scott: It was fine, but they would have not been able to run the scam until you brought it back.

99
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:10,131
Rym: Yep, and I knew about the scam because, way back, remember when you and I were in Australia for PAXOS, and we rented that car.

100
00:05:10,151 --> 00:05:12,139
Scott: Yeah, we just ran a normal car.

101
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,562
Rym: But the guy who was at the desk was super chill, and he was like, "Oh, let me just give you the cheapest

102
00:05:17,622 --> 00:05:17,824
Rym: rate.".

103
00:05:17,844 --> 00:05:18,509
Rym: Remember that whole conference?

104
00:05:18,529 --> 00:05:19,638
Scott: Yeah, that seemed like a normal guy.

105
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:20,906
Scott: That was a normal transaction.

106
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:21,629
Scott: He's like, "You want the

107
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:22,112
Scott: insurance?".

108
00:05:22,132 --> 00:05:23,117
Scott: We're like, "Yeah,

109
00:05:23,138 --> 00:05:23,439
Scott: whatever.".

110
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:34,400
Rym: But that's where we learned that most car rental places, like all the big companies, there's a minimum rate, and everything else is completely at the discretion of the local branch.

111
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,403
Rym: Doesn't really matter.

112
00:05:35,423 --> 00:05:46,767
Rym: So, if you know what that number is, or you're good with the people who actually are renting it to you at the desk, you can always get any car for almost nothing, except fancy luxury cars.

113
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,240
Rym: I also learned something else about this horrific car.

114
00:05:50,841 --> 00:05:55,100
Rym: Because it's a luxury car, no one ever rents these luxury cars.

115
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,899
Scott: Yeah, because no one's choosing the most expensive option, right?

116
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:06,603
Scott: So, that even though you might show up and have paid for a cheaper car, they still give you the cheapest car.

117
00:06:06,663 --> 00:06:10,417
Scott: So, the most expensive car at the rental place is driven very rarely.

118
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:15,579
Scott: Because in order for that to go off the lot, they have to rent every single car they've got, right?

119
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,045
Scott: Like, the busiest day in the universe.

120
00:06:17,487 --> 00:06:25,464
Rym: Yeah, but the thing that most people don't know is, I was like, "Note all the insurance," and I paused for a second because I remembered something very specific, a voice from my past.

121
00:06:26,046 --> 00:06:32,290
Rym: You know the automatic car insurance you get from credit cards with car rentals in America that almost no one knows about, but is still a thing?

122
00:06:33,896 --> 00:06:36,184
Rym: It does not apply to anything classed as luxury.

123
00:06:37,629 --> 00:06:39,354
Rym: Had I declined everything?

124
00:06:39,796 --> 00:06:41,823
Scott: Even if you have a fancy black credit card?

125
00:06:41,923 --> 00:06:42,746
Rym: Nope.

126
00:06:42,827 --> 00:06:53,707
Rym: Credit card insurance, at least the credit card insurance that I'm talking about, the automatic weird one, does not apply to anything classed as a luxury vehicle, and that is not obvious to most people.

127
00:06:54,068 --> 00:06:57,799
Scott: Even if you've got a black gold Zazen Jotaro card?

128
00:06:58,361 --> 00:07:04,800
Rym: I'm sure there's some credit card out there somewhere that, like, has special car insurance.

129
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:05,681
Scott: Yeah.

130
00:07:06,082 --> 00:07:07,306
Rym: But yeah, like the normal stuff.

131
00:07:07,607 --> 00:07:12,684
Rym: But then I realized it's weird that that insurance on credit cards still exists.

132
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:14,392
Rym: Like, no one cares about that.

133
00:07:14,473 --> 00:07:15,980
Rym: Most people don't even know about it.

134
00:07:16,241 --> 00:07:18,731
Rym: No one, like, picks a credit card because of it.

135
00:07:19,213 --> 00:07:20,559
Rym: Almost every credit card has it.

136
00:07:20,619 --> 00:07:21,947
Rym: Like, why is it still a thing?

137
00:07:22,249 --> 00:07:23,860
Rym: And I can't figure out the answer to that question.

138
00:07:25,101 --> 00:07:31,723
Scott: The reason it's still a thing is because, you know, let's say, you know, you go and you rent the car, right?

139
00:07:32,325 --> 00:07:34,351
Scott: And something happens and you got to pay for it.

140
00:07:34,873 --> 00:07:37,842
Scott: And you didn't choose the insurance, right?

141
00:07:38,323 --> 00:07:41,190
Scott: Well, odds are, right?

142
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:46,745
Scott: A lot of people just don't have the money to even pay, you know, they didn't choose the insurance.

143
00:07:46,806 --> 00:07:47,248
Scott: Okay.

144
00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:49,520
Scott: You know, you didn't get fooled by the car rental.

145
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,548
Scott: So it's like, they don't have the money.

146
00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:53,512
Scott: They can't afford.

147
00:07:53,752 --> 00:07:57,005
Scott: So the car rental place is just going to be out, right?

148
00:07:57,046 --> 00:07:58,553
Scott: They're going to have to use their own insurance.

149
00:07:59,116 --> 00:08:02,231
Scott: The car rental place will go, "Hey, you know, your credit card might cover

150
00:08:02,271 --> 00:08:02,432
Scott: this.".

151
00:08:02,492 --> 00:08:04,220
Scott: And that way they'll get a payout.

152
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,644
Rym: But here's the crazy thing.

153
00:08:06,508 --> 00:08:11,649
Rym: That is not on the kinds of credit cards that people who really don't have a lot of money have.

154
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:15,545
Rym: Like, from what I can gather, secured line credit cards do not have that insurance.

155
00:08:16,248 --> 00:08:16,630
Scott: I don't know.

156
00:08:16,951 --> 00:08:26,120
Scott: Go ask someone who works at a credit card company why credit cards continue to offer all these services that are, we think are unused or largely unused.

157
00:08:27,821 --> 00:08:28,924
Scott: You know, I don't know.

158
00:08:30,068 --> 00:08:34,381
Rym: But yeah, this car, I had to like park it on the street before I could like get rid of it.

159
00:08:34,422 --> 00:08:40,109
Rym: But the good news is when I dropped it off at the other place, the guy who gave it to me was like, he basically was laughing.

160
00:08:40,129 --> 00:08:42,418
Rym: He was like, "They're never going to give this to

161
00:08:42,578 --> 00:08:42,960
Rym: anybody.".

162
00:08:43,201 --> 00:08:45,990
Rym: Like he was, I think he was like doing it on purpose to get rid of this car.

163
00:08:46,471 --> 00:08:53,220
Scott: I think they it's like, you know, people might be like, "How do you know that those credit card services are

164
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:53,662
Scott: unused?".

165
00:08:53,722 --> 00:08:54,003
Scott: I don't.

166
00:08:54,465 --> 00:08:57,959
Scott: But I find it interesting that most people I know don't know those services exist.

167
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,388
Rym: That's the part, like it's one thing if people don't use it.

168
00:09:00,428 --> 00:09:05,912
Scott: We know, we know, right, but we know those services exist because we've been talking about it for years.

169
00:09:06,153 --> 00:09:07,762
Scott: When's the last time you used one of those services?

170
00:09:07,782 --> 00:09:09,048
Rym: Because I've never crashed a car.

171
00:09:09,692 --> 00:09:12,747
Scott: Well, I'm just saying any of the, your credit card offers tons of other services.

172
00:09:12,868 --> 00:09:19,735
Rym: Yeah, but like, I don't know, I guess they had, there's the warrant, warranty services against theft or things that are stolen.

173
00:09:19,755 --> 00:09:21,842
Rym: I forgot about that one because I've never needed it.

174
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:23,832
Scott: There's concierge services.

175
00:09:23,993 --> 00:09:24,756
Rym: I know about those.

176
00:09:24,776 --> 00:09:26,525
Rym: I don't use them because they can do anything.

177
00:09:26,987 --> 00:09:34,419
Scott: I'm just saying it's like, there are all these services that if you have pretty much any credit card, it offers a lot of, you get a bunch of stuff you don't even know about.

178
00:09:34,439 --> 00:09:36,609
Rym: I tried to use the concierge once with the chase card.

179
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:39,302
Rym: I was like, "Hey, they claim to have like all these event things.

180
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,487
Rym: Can you get me Rangers

181
00:09:40,507 --> 00:09:40,848
Rym: tickets?".

182
00:09:41,632 --> 00:09:42,816
Rym: And they were basically like,

183
00:09:42,897 --> 00:09:43,158
Rym: "No.".

184
00:09:43,178 --> 00:09:44,142
Rym: And I was like, "Okay,

185
00:09:44,182 --> 00:09:44,684
Rym: nevermind.".

186
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,038
Rym: Like the best they could do is like get the same StubHub.

187
00:09:48,058 --> 00:09:49,947
Rym: I was going to go to myself and do it for me.

188
00:09:49,967 --> 00:09:50,067
Rym: Right.

189
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,158
Scott: Well, that's, that's what, that's what it is.

190
00:09:52,198 --> 00:09:55,409
Scott: It's like call the phone, call up on the phone and someone does a thing for you.

191
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:58,580
Scott: It's not a better inside line.

192
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,475
Scott: It's call someone on the phone and they take care of shit for you.

193
00:10:02,495 --> 00:10:03,078
Scott: That's what it is.

194
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:06,677
Scott: But the point is, is that we know about these services and we never use them.

195
00:10:06,717 --> 00:10:12,882
Scott: So I assume based on that and the fact that no one else I know, unless I tell them, knows these services are there.

196
00:10:13,264 --> 00:10:15,273
Scott: I assume they're going largely unused.

197
00:10:15,674 --> 00:10:19,250
Scott: Why did the credit cards still have these arrangements to have those services exist?

198
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:19,471
Scott: Right.

199
00:10:19,571 --> 00:10:22,626
Scott: They're still paying that person that you called who couldn't help you.

200
00:10:22,927 --> 00:10:24,576
Scott: That's still a job someone's being paid for.

201
00:10:24,838 --> 00:10:25,019
Rym: Yeah.

202
00:10:25,099 --> 00:10:27,208
Rym: I mean, maybe it's all source aggregated.

203
00:10:27,228 --> 00:10:27,851
Rym: I don't know.

204
00:10:27,892 --> 00:10:29,057
Scott: It costs someone's money though.

205
00:10:29,077 --> 00:10:30,022
Scott: It costs someone money.

206
00:10:30,182 --> 00:10:30,423
Scott: Yep.

207
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:30,845
Scott: Right.

208
00:10:30,865 --> 00:10:36,351
Rym: It might just be that because we don't work in that industry, like we don't know there's some specific reason why all these things exist.

209
00:10:36,371 --> 00:10:39,845
Scott: That money could go into, go into CEO's pocket instead and no one would know.

210
00:10:39,926 --> 00:10:40,768
Scott: Right.

211
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:41,591
Rym: I don't know.

212
00:10:41,832 --> 00:10:51,773
Rym: I was thinking about that weird car insurance because it comes up a lot in my life because I know about it, but I realized that especially people younger than us just have no idea that exists.

213
00:10:51,793 --> 00:10:52,878
Rym: That's not a thing.

214
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:53,521
Scott: Why would you know?

215
00:10:53,542 --> 00:10:54,708
Scott: Your credit card doesn't tell you.

216
00:10:54,789 --> 00:10:55,493
Rym: Yeah, exactly.

217
00:10:55,513 --> 00:10:57,463
Rym: They almost go out of their way to not tell you.

218
00:10:57,483 --> 00:10:59,975
Scott: They'll tell you that they're giving you things.

219
00:11:00,036 --> 00:11:04,333
Rym: If you Google for it, you find third party websites that are like, "This credit card covers these

220
00:11:04,393 --> 00:11:04,915
Rym: cars.".

221
00:11:05,076 --> 00:11:09,096
Scott: Credit cards only brag about, you know, their low interest rates and their whatever is right.

222
00:11:09,116 --> 00:11:10,742
Scott: They don't brag about all the other stuff.

223
00:11:12,787 --> 00:11:15,273
Rym: So yeah, that's, that was my weekend.

224
00:11:15,433 --> 00:11:22,933
Scott: So there's big, big news like, talking about this on GeekNights for quite a while on and off.

225
00:11:23,355 --> 00:11:23,616
Scott: Right.

226
00:11:24,438 --> 00:11:24,739
Scott: I see.

227
00:11:24,819 --> 00:11:27,027
Scott: I can't, I wish I could find the episode where I first mentioned it.

228
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:27,429
Scott: Right.

229
00:11:27,489 --> 00:11:29,978
Scott: But Nvidia, right.

230
00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:32,246
Scott: Who makes all the GPUs that are the best.

231
00:11:32,527 --> 00:11:32,747
Scott: Right.

232
00:11:33,409 --> 00:11:35,255
Scott: Is buying ARM holdings.

233
00:11:35,476 --> 00:11:35,757
Scott: Right.

234
00:11:35,797 --> 00:11:41,074
Scott: So if you don't know, the majority of CPUs in the world, I don't know if that's true.

235
00:11:41,094 --> 00:11:43,203
Scott: There might be some like tiny ones people don't think about.

236
00:11:43,223 --> 00:11:43,424
Scott: Right.

237
00:11:43,444 --> 00:11:50,807
Scott: But most of the important CPUs in the world today are built on the ARM CPU architecture.

238
00:11:51,068 --> 00:11:51,308
Scott: Right.

239
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,736
Scott: So you think x86 is the big one.

240
00:11:53,776 --> 00:11:55,883
Scott: It's like, nah, that's only in PCs pretty much.

241
00:11:55,983 --> 00:11:58,711
Rym: PCs, workstations, servers, but not all servers.

242
00:11:59,474 --> 00:12:03,326
Scott: Nope, not all servers, but mostly desktop PCs, laptops.

243
00:12:03,366 --> 00:12:07,299
Scott: That's where you find x86 and even ARM is creeping into those areas.

244
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:07,520
Scott: Right.

245
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,188
Scott: You see Apple is switching from x86 to ARM.

246
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:14,400
Scott: Already all iOS, Android devices already run an ARM.

247
00:12:15,281 --> 00:12:18,811
Scott: Pretty much every car has an ARM, has ARM CPUs in it.

248
00:12:20,055 --> 00:12:22,703
Scott: If it has CPUs at all, it's not just a mechanical car.

249
00:12:23,224 --> 00:12:25,009
Scott: Right.

250
00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:28,438
Scott: If you have like a smart TV, that's an ARM CPU almost definitely.

251
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:28,558
Scott: Right.

252
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,468
Scott: So ARM, this company, right.

253
00:12:34,149 --> 00:12:39,982
Scott: It's sort of a weird company and that it's sort of an IP holding company.

254
00:12:40,444 --> 00:12:40,805
Scott: Right.

255
00:12:41,206 --> 00:12:43,633
Scott: It doesn't like make CPUs directly.

256
00:12:43,794 --> 00:12:43,914
Scott: Right.

257
00:12:43,934 --> 00:12:47,063
Scott: For example, your iOS device has an A whatever CPU in it.

258
00:12:47,244 --> 00:12:47,505
Scott: Right.

259
00:12:48,006 --> 00:12:50,432
Scott: But, um, that CPU is made by Apple.

260
00:12:50,914 --> 00:12:54,885
Scott: Apple doesn't, you know, own ARM, obviously Nvidia does now.

261
00:12:54,905 --> 00:12:57,675
Scott: Uh, and SoftBank, SoftBank did before.

262
00:12:58,176 --> 00:13:00,705
Scott: So why is, how is Apple making these ARM processors?

263
00:13:00,745 --> 00:13:03,935
Scott: Cause they license, you know, things from ARM holdings.

264
00:13:04,276 --> 00:13:04,497
Scott: Right.

265
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:09,209
Scott: So all these CPUs in the world, right.

266
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:16,429
Scott: All these people making ARM CPUs now have to license the ARM technology from the Nvidia corporation.

267
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:17,411
Scott: Right.

268
00:13:17,932 --> 00:13:22,644
Scott: Uh, for most devices that you would think of as having a CPU.

269
00:13:23,265 --> 00:13:23,526
Scott: Right.

270
00:13:24,268 --> 00:13:25,993
Scott: That's a huge deal, right?

271
00:13:26,293 --> 00:13:30,305
Scott: Uh, it's going to affect everyday computing for people years from now.

272
00:13:30,346 --> 00:13:37,031
Scott: You're going to see, especially with the downfall of Intel, as I said before, you were going to see the all Nvidia computer.

273
00:13:37,272 --> 00:13:37,773
Scott: it's coming.

274
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:38,496
Scott: Right.

275
00:13:38,858 --> 00:13:40,083
Scott: Just a computer you buy.

276
00:13:40,384 --> 00:13:44,461
Scott: It's got nothing, but I mean, all the, obviously not everything in it will be made by Nvidia.

277
00:13:44,481 --> 00:13:48,337
Scott: I mean, even the, I, even an iPhone Apple doesn't make the screen.

278
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:51,108
Scott: They don't make, there's a lot of parts in an iPhone Apple doesn't make.

279
00:13:51,168 --> 00:13:51,389
Scott: Right.

280
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:54,403
Scott: But we're talking the major chips, the big ones, right?

281
00:13:54,463 --> 00:13:57,518
Scott: All the, all those little IO chips and radios and all the small bits.

282
00:13:57,538 --> 00:13:57,639
Rym: Right.

283
00:13:57,699 --> 00:14:04,302
Rym: Now this is right hot on the heels of the pretty like serious announcements about the new Nvidia graphics chips.

284
00:14:05,285 --> 00:14:06,008
Scott: Yeah, that's true.

285
00:14:06,169 --> 00:14:06,510
Scott: That's true.

286
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,157
Scott: But that's just, you know, par for the course.

287
00:14:08,197 --> 00:14:08,398
Scott: Right.

288
00:14:08,418 --> 00:14:10,484
Scott: Just keep upgrading their GPUs.

289
00:14:10,544 --> 00:14:10,725
Scott: Right.

290
00:14:10,745 --> 00:14:19,511
Scott: But yeah, so now Nvidia is like, uh, by owning arm is now absolutely a bigger, more important company than Intel.

291
00:14:19,812 --> 00:14:20,093
Scott: Right.

292
00:14:20,213 --> 00:14:21,899
Scott: And AMD, right.

293
00:14:21,939 --> 00:14:29,002
Scott: They're, they're like maybe the biggest and most important chip company there is now by owning this and all the GPU stuff.

294
00:14:29,724 --> 00:14:40,880
Scott: Uh, Nvidia also has said that they're planning to sort of shift their GPUs to like an arm model almost right to where, yeah, they're still going to be making GPUs.

295
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:41,701
Scott: Right.

296
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,433
Scott: But you know how they don't make cards really.

297
00:14:43,474 --> 00:14:45,003
Scott: I guess they do make a few, but not really.

298
00:14:45,023 --> 00:14:46,791
Scott: You don't buy an Nvidia GPU card.

299
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:49,122
Scott: Someone else makes the card and buys chips from Nvidia.

300
00:14:49,182 --> 00:14:49,363
Scott: Yeah.

301
00:14:49,605 --> 00:14:50,871
Rym: That's why you see all those brands.

302
00:14:50,911 --> 00:14:54,468
Rym: Like you look at like GTX, whatever, and you'll see like a bunch of different types.

303
00:14:54,508 --> 00:14:58,825
Scott: They're all pretty much from ACEs or, you know, they might look a little different.

304
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:03,483
Rym: They might be overclocked a little bit more or a little bit whatever.

305
00:15:04,044 --> 00:15:15,578
Scott: But Nvidia is going to, in the same way that arm licenses out the arm CPU designs, architectures, APIs, all that, you know, IP related to the arm chips, right?

306
00:15:15,618 --> 00:15:17,102
Scott: To other people who actually make chips.

307
00:15:18,266 --> 00:15:35,253
Scott: Uh, Nvidia is saying they're planning to down the line license out their GPU technologies that somebody else who makes chips that is not Nvidia could pay Nvidia money and make their own GPUs within video stuff.

308
00:15:35,293 --> 00:15:40,449
Scott: The same way that Apple makes an a, whatever CPU for the iPhone, right?

309
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:44,923
Scott: Even though it's an arm CPU, it, you code for it in arm assembly, right?

310
00:15:45,284 --> 00:15:46,527
Scott: But it's made by Apple.

311
00:15:47,109 --> 00:15:49,976
Scott: You could see Apple licensing, right?

312
00:15:50,277 --> 00:16:00,582
Scott: Because right, Nvidia GPUs from Nvidia and they could make like the AN one GPU and it's a Nvidia GPU, right?

313
00:16:00,703 --> 00:16:08,592
Scott: That's very similar to the Nvidia GTX, whatever number they're on, but Apple makes it and it's in Apple devices, right?

314
00:16:08,612 --> 00:16:11,060
Scott: And it could actually end up being better.

315
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,414
Scott: Like it could end up being the best Nvidia GPU, right?

316
00:16:15,454 --> 00:16:19,637
Scott: Like better than the ones Nvidia makes, but Nvidia won't give a shit because they'll be making all the licensing money.

317
00:16:19,657 --> 00:16:20,039
Scott: They don't care.

318
00:16:20,682 --> 00:16:20,782
Rym: Yup.

319
00:16:20,803 --> 00:16:21,788
Scott: This could be okay with that.

320
00:16:21,809 --> 00:16:25,367
Rym: This could bode well potentially for Apple, like actually having good GPUs.

321
00:16:25,809 --> 00:16:28,099
Scott: Well, this, so there's also some shenanigans, right?

322
00:16:28,119 --> 00:16:35,172
Scott: Because Nvidia, despite, you know, obviously making all their chips on the other side of the world, as all chips are as not all, but you know, right.

323
00:16:35,292 --> 00:16:36,336
Rym: I mean, I worked in a fab.

324
00:16:36,376 --> 00:16:40,250
Rym: We did not all our, we made chips to learn how to make chips.

325
00:16:40,552 --> 00:16:42,520
Rym: We didn't make the bulk chips, the bulk chips.

326
00:16:42,841 --> 00:16:45,571
Rym: Once the process was set, were made overseas, right?

327
00:16:45,692 --> 00:16:49,646
Scott: Mostly Nvidia is still in America is a United States company, right?

328
00:16:49,767 --> 00:16:51,994
Scott: It's, it's based in the United States, right?

329
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:58,320
Scott: It's not a, uh, obviously it operates internationally, uh, as, as, as does Apple, right?

330
00:16:58,721 --> 00:17:00,345
Scott: But Apple's a United States company.

331
00:17:01,107 --> 00:17:06,059
Scott: Uh, most of the arm stuff is the rest of the world, right?

332
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:11,393
Rym: So well, like SoftBank is the one selling arm to, uh, right.

333
00:17:11,473 --> 00:17:15,503
Scott: So, uh, well, a lot of people around the world, right.

334
00:17:15,825 --> 00:17:17,931
Scott: Are really upset about this, right?

335
00:17:18,452 --> 00:17:22,324
Scott: So you might actually see, uh, potentially, right.

336
00:17:22,384 --> 00:17:39,185
Scott: If Nvidia can't sort of keep the ducks in line and keep everyone happy, you could see people abandoning arm, you know, you could see like Chinese chip manufacturers being like, well, we don't want to send our money to Nvidia and the U S to keep making arm chips, uh, screw that shit.

337
00:17:39,205 --> 00:17:40,169
Scott: We're going to do something else.

338
00:17:40,732 --> 00:17:40,953
Scott: Right.

339
00:17:41,254 --> 00:17:46,920
Scott: And there are, there already has been rumblings of these nature, like as of like, you know, I mean, there's a lot of stuff like.

340
00:17:47,040 --> 00:18:02,840
Rym: one of the notes in this article is SoftBank, you know, they're selling UK's arm holdings to the U S chip manufacturer for 40 billion, just four years after its founder bought the chip designer and said it would be the linchpin for the future of the Japanese technology group SoftBank.

341
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:03,984
Rym: So they bought it.

342
00:18:04,185 --> 00:18:06,155
Scott: SoftBank is just, you know, they bought it.

343
00:18:06,235 --> 00:18:08,607
Rym: It was going to be the quote linchpin of their technology.

344
00:18:08,627 --> 00:18:11,140
Rym: And four years later, they're selling it for 40 billion.

345
00:18:12,321 --> 00:18:18,181
Rym: I don't know what they bought it for or like how they acquire, like, I have no idea these relationships.

346
00:18:18,201 --> 00:18:24,505
Scott: I never understood why arm was, the thing I didn't understand was why was arm for sale to begin with?

347
00:18:24,586 --> 00:18:25,751
Scott: It's such a valuable thing.

348
00:18:25,852 --> 00:18:27,339
Scott: Wouldn't it just exist on its own?

349
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:29,146
Rym: I mean, all things are for sale all the time.

350
00:18:29,728 --> 00:18:32,239
Scott: That's true, but it was so strong, right?

351
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:37,520
Scott: Obviously people would want to buy it, I guess, but it's like, you know, it's like, yeah, Apple's for sale.

352
00:18:37,821 --> 00:18:38,905
Scott: It's like, you can't buy it.

353
00:18:39,066 --> 00:18:39,488
Scott: Good luck.

354
00:18:39,568 --> 00:18:39,909
Scott: Right.

355
00:18:39,989 --> 00:18:40,632
Scott: It's number one.

356
00:18:40,672 --> 00:18:40,933
Scott: Right.

357
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,640
Scott: So Microsoft is for sale.

358
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:43,944
Scott: No one's can buy that.

359
00:18:44,145 --> 00:18:44,366
Scott: Right.

360
00:18:44,426 --> 00:18:49,227
Scott: So I figured arm was at that level of you can't buy that, but I guess that wasn't obviously was not the case.

361
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:56,271
Scott: So yeah, I think SoftBank just wasn't in a position to capitalize, you know, on owning.

362
00:18:56,311 --> 00:19:00,206
Rym: Well, so SoftBank, remember these things are very rarely.

363
00:19:00,266 --> 00:19:09,828
Rym: Now again, I'm not going to like, I don't have inside information or anything, but very rarely, and you can read this article, are transactions like buying a big company, just here's $40 billion in cash.

364
00:19:09,868 --> 00:19:10,712
Rym: Thank you for the company.

365
00:19:11,134 --> 00:19:13,082
Rym: Usually there's trading of assets and things.

366
00:19:13,603 --> 00:19:19,160
Rym: So the way this is working, SoftBank will be the single largest shareholder in Nvidia.

367
00:19:20,622 --> 00:19:21,184
Scott: Oh, really?

368
00:19:21,265 --> 00:19:22,409
Rym: Nvidia is paying.

369
00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:26,061
Scott: Oh, but it's not going to, but it's not going to add up to 51%.

370
00:19:26,061 --> 00:19:28,491
Scott: It's the single largest shareholder.

371
00:19:28,512 --> 00:19:30,540
Rym: So I don't think there'll be a majority, but I did not check.

372
00:19:30,741 --> 00:19:40,725
Scott: I guess I could look that up, but there'll be, but right, but there'll be no one else like, so they might end up holding 15% of Nvidia, but it's like, no one else individually has 15%, but there's still.

373
00:19:40,765 --> 00:19:46,906
Scott: probably maybe like a group of people that collectively are, you know, have like our like-minded shareholders that have more.

374
00:19:47,066 --> 00:19:52,882
Rym: video is paying SoftBank 21.5 billion in their own stock.

375
00:19:53,644 --> 00:19:53,885
Scott: Yeah.

376
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:57,076
Scott: And so that comes, so who owned that stock previously, right?

377
00:19:57,097 --> 00:19:59,387
Scott: Like the, the board of Nvidia, I assume, right?

378
00:19:59,447 --> 00:19:59,648
Rym: Yeah.

379
00:19:59,688 --> 00:20:01,980
Rym: Probably the company itself probably, you know, train game.

380
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,107
Rym: It's in the company.

381
00:20:04,227 --> 00:20:04,669
Scott: They're there.

382
00:20:04,709 --> 00:20:04,850
Scott: Yeah.

383
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:05,271
Scott: Okay.

384
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:06,214
Scott: They haven't sold them yet.

385
00:20:06,275 --> 00:20:06,495
Scott: Yep.

386
00:20:06,636 --> 00:20:11,310
Rym: And no one bought those IPO shares and $12 billion in cash.

387
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:15,924
Rym: So SoftBank's still in a position to make money from this investment.

388
00:20:16,206 --> 00:20:17,331
Rym: There's probably a lot going on.

389
00:20:17,371 --> 00:20:19,843
Rym: We don't know about, and we're not qualified to talk about.

390
00:20:20,244 --> 00:20:23,056
Rym: the only thing we're interested in is what will this do to technology?

391
00:20:23,518 --> 00:20:31,752
Scott: This is going to make, you know, this is just the next step in something that's been a long time rumbling, you know, chips move slowly as far as consumers see the chip world.

392
00:20:31,812 --> 00:20:32,113
Scott: Right.

393
00:20:33,117 --> 00:20:38,492
Scott: But chips, you know, microchips, Silicon underlies all computing, right?

394
00:20:38,893 --> 00:20:44,191
Scott: That's everything else is just like boards and what, you know, input, output is like the chips make.

395
00:20:44,754 --> 00:20:46,119
Scott: that's where all the action is.

396
00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:46,360
Scott: Right.

397
00:20:46,701 --> 00:20:51,800
Scott: So if something happens in chip land, you see that bubble over into everything else eventually.

398
00:20:52,201 --> 00:20:52,422
Scott: Right.

399
00:20:52,482 --> 00:20:54,651
Scott: So this has been brewing for a long time.

400
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:56,659
Scott: Intel's been having a lot of trouble.

401
00:20:56,679 --> 00:20:57,824
Scott: They've been going downhill.

402
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:58,386
Scott: Right.

403
00:20:58,427 --> 00:21:03,149
Scott: You started seeing that when they had their delays on certain new processes that were coming down the line.

404
00:21:03,249 --> 00:21:05,259
Rym: You start to run into diminishing returns.

405
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:10,096
Scott: You're seeing Nvidia, Intel reorg, a lot of people leaving Intel.

406
00:21:10,217 --> 00:21:11,180
Scott: Intel's having a lot of trouble.

407
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,022
Scott: They're going down.

408
00:21:12,484 --> 00:21:21,272
Scott: Everyone AMD went up a little bit in the x86 space, but you can see the world moving over to ARM over the past 10, 20 years.

409
00:21:21,292 --> 00:21:21,974
Scott: Right.

410
00:21:22,336 --> 00:21:23,639
Scott: Like world has been moving to ARM.

411
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:26,192
Rym: On one end, like you might say, oh, we're just talking about ARM.

412
00:21:26,233 --> 00:21:28,021
Rym: and like laptops a long time ago, not work yet.

413
00:21:28,984 --> 00:21:31,833
Rym: Consumer stuff is like direct consumer stuff.

414
00:21:31,853 --> 00:21:34,581
Rym: Like a laptop is a totally different ball game.

415
00:21:35,203 --> 00:21:44,408
Scott: And it moves really slowly because you can't easily like rebuild that software and like redeliver that software to the consumers of the world.

416
00:21:44,689 --> 00:21:52,811
Scott: But industrial devices, software devices, embedded things, all those things are basically already ARM.

417
00:21:52,831 --> 00:22:00,676
Scott: And it's much easier to, if you're actually, it's like you tend to build something and then it stays that way forever.

418
00:22:01,097 --> 00:22:01,318
Scott: Right.

419
00:22:01,338 --> 00:22:04,990
Scott: The chips that are being made and produced are for new things.

420
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:05,733
Scott: Right.

421
00:22:05,753 --> 00:22:09,649
Scott: So either someone's redoing all their biz or they're buying all new biz.

422
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:10,051
Scott: Right.

423
00:22:10,373 --> 00:22:14,029
Scott: It's not like people are sitting there and upgrading and sticking what they got like consumers do.

424
00:22:14,069 --> 00:22:14,310
Scott: Right.

425
00:22:15,655 --> 00:22:27,632
Rym: So supposedly part of this, which I'm wondering about, is to make this happen, SoftBank also decided not to strip an Internet of Things thing out of ARM before the sale.

426
00:22:27,712 --> 00:22:34,479
Rym: So all the Internet of Things stuff, which seems to be the thing that people are actually interested in, that is with ARM.

427
00:22:34,539 --> 00:22:37,210
Rym: It's not going to like stay with SoftBank or be its own company.

428
00:22:37,953 --> 00:22:38,073
Scott: Yeah.

429
00:22:38,093 --> 00:22:46,094
Scott: There's also like a lot of like AI and other sort of smaller concerns that fall underneath.

430
00:22:46,475 --> 00:22:46,756
Scott: Right.

431
00:22:47,096 --> 00:22:50,205
Scott: That Nvidia can now shift according to its interests.

432
00:22:50,265 --> 00:22:56,447
Scott: And you'll see a lot of articles around talking about each individual sort of aspect of this.

433
00:22:56,527 --> 00:22:56,768
Scott: Right.

434
00:22:56,808 --> 00:23:00,022
Scott: From the different angles of all the different things that are affected.

435
00:23:00,042 --> 00:23:05,703
Scott: And that's sort of the point is like, wow, there are so many things that are being affected by this.

436
00:23:06,366 --> 00:23:06,727
Scott: Right.

437
00:23:06,847 --> 00:23:07,008
Scott: Yeah.

438
00:23:07,028 --> 00:23:14,034
Rym: Like even reading this article, you'll learn names of companies you've never heard of just reading this like really high level article.

439
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,283
Scott: All of those things down the line.

440
00:23:16,343 --> 00:23:16,524
Scott: Right.

441
00:23:16,664 --> 00:23:18,551
Scott: All of those different areas.

442
00:23:18,611 --> 00:23:18,772
Scott: Right.

443
00:23:18,812 --> 00:23:23,526
Scott: The AI area, the car area, the graphics area, all these areas.

444
00:23:23,887 --> 00:23:24,068
Scott: Right.

445
00:23:24,148 --> 00:23:25,311
Scott: That's how big this is.

446
00:23:25,371 --> 00:23:26,554
Scott: It's like this foundational shifting.

447
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:33,654
Scott: So, you know, someone was like, man, why didn't you buy?

448
00:23:34,216 --> 00:23:35,620
Scott: talking about buying Nvidia's stock?

449
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,056
Scott: And I'm like, you know, I said this, like what's going to happen?

450
00:23:39,076 --> 00:23:39,940
Scott: How many years ago?

451
00:23:40,341 --> 00:23:43,173
Scott: But I was not, I'm not an evil money thinking person.

452
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:50,302
Scott: So I, if I thought at the time, if someone had just said, if you think Nvidia is going to own the world, why don't you buy Nvidia stock?

453
00:23:50,342 --> 00:23:52,512
Scott: If someone had said that at the time, I probably would have.

454
00:23:53,256 --> 00:23:54,120
Scott: I don't think that way.

455
00:23:54,481 --> 00:23:55,305
Scott: And now it's too late.

456
00:23:55,646 --> 00:23:56,510
Scott: So it doesn't matter.

457
00:23:56,911 --> 00:23:59,924
Rym: I haven't looked at how Nvidia stock went since the announcement, actually.

458
00:24:00,386 --> 00:24:02,233
Rym: I assume it just skyrocket, but I don't know.

459
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:04,642
Scott: It's and I'm pretty sure it's envy.

460
00:24:04,722 --> 00:24:04,923
Scott: Right.

461
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:07,250
Rym: Cause I personally don't invest in technology stocks.

462
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,175
Scott: So envy up 17% today.

463
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:11,302
Rym: Yeah.

464
00:24:11,362 --> 00:24:12,206
Rym: That looks about right.

465
00:24:12,808 --> 00:24:12,949
Scott: Yeah.

466
00:24:13,009 --> 00:24:13,149
Scott: Okay.

467
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:13,832
Scott: That's a lot.

468
00:24:13,973 --> 00:24:15,138
Scott: Oh no, wait, no, it's DraftKings.

469
00:24:15,238 --> 00:24:15,640
Rym: Nvidia.

470
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,043
Scott: DraftKings up them.

471
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,529
Rym: It's actually only a 5% today.

472
00:24:18,569 --> 00:24:18,991
Rym: Let's see.

473
00:24:19,011 --> 00:24:19,533
Rym: Yeah.

474
00:24:19,714 --> 00:24:21,320
Rym: Not significantly up on this.

475
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,624
Scott: Why is Yahoo finance?

476
00:24:22,644 --> 00:24:23,366
Scott: Fucking this up.

477
00:24:23,466 --> 00:24:24,028
Scott: I type in it.

478
00:24:24,128 --> 00:24:24,790
Scott: Oh, it's NVDA.

479
00:24:24,931 --> 00:24:25,252
Scott: All right.

480
00:24:25,332 --> 00:24:26,817
Scott: It's up 5% today.

481
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:30,050
Scott: Why was DraftKings up 17% today?

482
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,235
Scott: I guess because football's back.

483
00:24:31,296 --> 00:24:32,762
Rym: Maybe because football's back for now.

484
00:24:32,883 --> 00:24:33,787
Scott: Why did, how come?

485
00:24:33,827 --> 00:24:37,726
Scott: when I typed in envy into Yahoo finance and pressed enter, it brought me to DraftKings.

486
00:24:37,766 --> 00:24:41,424
Scott: And when I typed in Nvidia and pressed enter, it brought me to some natural gas corporation.

487
00:24:41,926 --> 00:24:45,580
Scott: Only I had to type exactly NVDA, the correct symbol to get it.

488
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,081
Rym: Wait.

489
00:24:46,342 --> 00:24:48,451
Rym: Oh, I have to type in the correct symbol to get it.

490
00:24:48,692 --> 00:24:50,399
Rym: Welcome to my goddamn job.

491
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:58,725
Scott: Why shouldn't it be fucking intelligent enough that if I type in Envy, like this is the number one stock that begins with Envy.

492
00:24:59,086 --> 00:25:00,370
Scott: Is it really?

493
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:03,239
Scott: Why would it take me to DraftKings DKNG?

494
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:05,989
Rym: Why are you on Yahoo finance?

495
00:25:06,391 --> 00:25:07,616
Scott: It's just the first thing I went to.

496
00:25:07,656 --> 00:25:08,660
Scott: I went to Google finance.

497
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,412
Rym: If I type Envy, it says Envy does not match any finance or financial results.

498
00:25:13,355 --> 00:25:14,518
Scott: Oh, Google.

499
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,609
Rym: And if I type in, it suggests some stuff.

500
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:20,540
Rym: If I type Envy, it suggests Nvidia as the first thing.

501
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,103
Rym: And then Novanax.

502
00:25:22,123 --> 00:25:25,820
Scott: If I press, if I press enter, I expect it to go to the first suggestion.

503
00:25:26,201 --> 00:25:27,930
Scott: That means I like the first suggestion.

504
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:28,432
Scott: Take me there.

505
00:25:28,452 --> 00:25:28,934
Scott: I'm pressing enter.

506
00:25:28,955 --> 00:25:29,959
Rym: No, I hate that UX.

507
00:25:30,241 --> 00:25:32,088
Rym: because when I, if I love that, no.

508
00:25:32,148 --> 00:25:36,849
Rym: Cause if I see a dropdown maybe, you know how often I type something cause I want to search for the specific string.

509
00:25:37,692 --> 00:25:39,641
Rym: Some recommendations appear that are not like.

510
00:25:39,681 --> 00:25:41,892
Rym: they're longer versions of that, that I don't want.

511
00:25:41,993 --> 00:25:42,294
Scott: All right.

512
00:25:42,314 --> 00:25:43,460
Scott: So yes, I agree with that.

513
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,212
Scott: When you're on Google, you don't want, but I'm on Google.

514
00:25:46,774 --> 00:25:47,176
Scott: No, no, no.

515
00:25:47,216 --> 00:25:48,160
Scott: This is Google finance.

516
00:25:48,401 --> 00:25:52,100
Scott: If you, you basically, unless you type in a correct symbol, you don't get search results.

517
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,082
Rym: No, but it does.

518
00:25:53,122 --> 00:25:55,571
Rym: It does do a dropdown of typed Envy.

519
00:25:55,892 --> 00:25:58,380
Scott: The point is there's no search results.

520
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,583
Scott: If I type in video and press enter without clicking that first suggestion, it takes me to nothing.

521
00:26:02,864 --> 00:26:05,878
Scott: So there's not like, it's not like, oops, I didn't want to do that.

522
00:26:05,979 --> 00:26:11,585
Scott: It's like, there's no reason you would ever want to not pick the first suggestion when pressing enter on a Google search.

523
00:26:11,685 --> 00:26:12,188
Scott: I agree.

524
00:26:12,208 --> 00:26:14,357
Scott: You want to just go to your search results.

525
00:26:14,378 --> 00:26:15,443
Scott: You don't want the suggestion.

526
00:26:15,603 --> 00:26:17,553
Scott: Also there are, there are search results.

527
00:26:17,654 --> 00:26:18,699
Rym: There are a lot of stocks.

528
00:26:18,739 --> 00:26:20,044
Rym: Like, you know what the symbol for Ford is?

529
00:26:20,767 --> 00:26:22,192
Rym: just F yeah.

530
00:26:22,212 --> 00:26:27,354
Scott: But then Facebook, if I press F and press enter, actually I tell, Oh, but I that's cause it is the symbol, right?

531
00:26:27,374 --> 00:26:27,535
Scott: Yeah.

532
00:26:27,616 --> 00:26:27,796
Rym: Yeah.

533
00:26:27,937 --> 00:26:29,982
Rym: It actually is the symbol.

534
00:26:30,583 --> 00:26:31,685
Scott: So it's also the first thing.

535
00:26:31,765 --> 00:26:41,466
Rym: Also globally, there are many stocks that have the same symbol or a C doll.

536
00:26:41,687 --> 00:26:42,652
Rym: You want to do it the right way.

537
00:26:42,692 --> 00:26:44,783
Rym: It should make you type in a Q-Zip or a C doll.

538
00:26:45,204 --> 00:26:46,951
Scott: The point is there's no Envy.

539
00:26:47,011 --> 00:26:54,180
Scott: So if I press Envy and Nvidia is the first suggestion and searching for Envy doesn't do anything, pressing enter should go to the first suggestion.

540
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,555
Rym: But I'm just saying there are a lot of different identifiers of stocks.

541
00:26:56,596 --> 00:26:57,823
Rym: There are stocks that have the same symbol.

542
00:26:57,924 --> 00:27:00,660
Scott: Well, no one's using those on Google finance, so they don't matter.

543
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,804
Rym: Google finances global.

544
00:27:02,824 --> 00:27:03,507
Rym: So you never know.

545
00:27:04,149 --> 00:27:04,812
Scott: No one's using that.

546
00:27:04,933 --> 00:27:05,153
Scott: All right.

547
00:27:05,676 --> 00:27:09,333
Rym: I remember way back trying to buy some stock that was not listed in America.

548
00:27:09,373 --> 00:27:11,041
Scott: It's okay that we spent a lot of time on this cause.

549
00:27:11,081 --> 00:27:16,666
Rym: it's a big news, but we didn't make it a move on because as much as there's a lot of news, we would just be speculating.

550
00:27:16,686 --> 00:27:17,590
Rym: We're not actually like that.

551
00:27:17,751 --> 00:27:19,579
Rym: Like I'm not an expert in our tech.

552
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:24,483
Scott: I know enough to know that this is huge and to have seen it coming, but I have not, I don't know enough to know all.

553
00:27:25,165 --> 00:27:26,509
Scott: And also big, I can't.

554
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:30,624
Rym: frankly, the technology considerations are not going to be what drive this.

555
00:27:30,704 --> 00:27:34,402
Rym: The corporate and government considerations are going to be what drive how this develops.

556
00:27:34,764 --> 00:27:36,511
Rym: And we do not know enough about that.

557
00:27:36,531 --> 00:27:40,087
Scott: I mean, the technology considerations, I don't think are going to change.

558
00:27:40,107 --> 00:27:53,470
Rym: They're definitely going to change, but they're, you know, it's like, it's like there's the, there's the vector of where like computing technology is going in the world and it just turns slightly in a slightly different direction now, but down the road that'll end up being a big difference.

559
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:59,050
Rym: But like a year from now, it's now the world's not going to change dramatically because of this.

560
00:27:59,070 --> 00:27:59,110
Rym: No.

561
00:28:01,018 --> 00:28:15,940
Rym: So in some really brief news that just highlights a problem in technology where there are certain problems that are caused by humans and they seem trivial, but sometimes they have real world consequences, like time zones messing up can kill people if you're making the wrong kind of software.

562
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:39,095
Rym: So this is a story where a family in Spain was basically accused of child porn because an IP address dynamic that at the time was allocated to their house and like very few enough other people, I guess, to where odds were any communication on this IP was their

563
00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:39,256
Scott: house.

564
00:28:39,276 --> 00:28:41,021
Scott: Was this a shared IP on a NAT?

565
00:28:41,443 --> 00:28:43,750
Rym: No, within one single family home it looks like.

566
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:48,788
Scott: Okay, so the ISP was tracking which dynamic IP was assigned to which house at which time.

567
00:28:49,189 --> 00:28:51,137
Scott: That IP address got porn at that time.

568
00:28:51,197 --> 00:28:52,622
Rym: It uploaded some child porn.

569
00:28:53,204 --> 00:28:54,368
Scott: Okay, so it could have been.

570
00:28:54,388 --> 00:28:55,472
Scott: they're guilty.

571
00:28:55,873 --> 00:28:58,622
Scott: It also could have been a mistake, obviously.

572
00:28:58,762 --> 00:29:00,149
Scott: Anything can always be a mistake, right?

573
00:29:00,952 --> 00:29:04,730
Scott: Or it could have been like some malwares in their house uploading child porn using their computer.

574
00:29:04,751 --> 00:29:06,660
Rym: There's a lot of ways that could go.

575
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,376
Scott: Basically the point I'm trying to make is I don't know the law in Spain, but in the US.

576
00:29:13,219 --> 00:29:17,618
Scott: what I'm saying is that based on that evidence alone and my expertise, there is reasonable doubt.

577
00:29:17,939 --> 00:29:18,923
Rym: Oh yeah, reasonable doubt.

578
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:25,824
Rym: So what happened was they got a search warrant to go to the house to try to reduce the reasonable doubt.

579
00:29:25,884 --> 00:29:26,787
Scott: Okay, sounds good.

580
00:29:26,827 --> 00:29:38,333
Scott: Yeah, at least I agree as a non-lawyer that with that evidence, although there's still reasonable doubt, if I was a judge and you brought that evidence to me, I would give you a search warrant.

581
00:29:38,353 --> 00:29:39,900
Scott: Judge Scott says search warrant.

582
00:29:40,241 --> 00:29:42,818
Rym: So Scott, reasonable doubt, remember, is only during the trial right now.

583
00:29:42,838 --> 00:29:46,555
Scott: I know, but what I'm saying is that we're looking for probable cause.

584
00:29:46,636 --> 00:29:47,580
Rym: is the term you're looking for.

585
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,520
Scott: I'm saying is that with that evidence, Judge Scott would give the search warrant.

586
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,956
Rym: Yeah, it would be probable cause for a search warrant to go.

587
00:29:53,016 --> 00:29:53,600
Rym: just check it out.

588
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,307
Scott: Juror Scott would say not guilty.

589
00:29:56,388 --> 00:30:03,359
Rym: So yeah, so the cops show up and they don't find anything and they do their shitty cop stuff and you can read them all out in the story.

590
00:30:03,399 --> 00:30:11,024
Rym: They harass the family, eventually found nothing, but the family then fought back to try to figure out how the hell this happened.

591
00:30:11,285 --> 00:30:14,620
Rym: You know why this family was incorrectly accused of child porn?

592
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:21,180
Rym: Because the report came from the United States with the United States date format.

593
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:26,560
Rym: The police in Spain used the European date format, month, day, year.

594
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:31,239
Scott: So if they had corrected the date and time, they would have gone after a different IP address.

595
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,340
Scott: That IP address would have, well, it's the same IP address.

596
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:39,020
Rym: No, it was the same IP address, but the family was not using that IP address on that day.

597
00:30:39,741 --> 00:30:40,285
Scott: Right, exactly.

598
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:44,513
Scott: It would have been the same IP address, but they would have found out, "Ah, that IP address wasn't assigned to this house.

599
00:30:44,573 --> 00:30:46,607
Scott: It was assigned to someone else at that date and

600
00:30:46,627 --> 00:30:46,889
Scott: time.".

601
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,280
Scott: They just had the date and time wrong.

602
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,907
Rym: So 10/11/2016 could be 10/11 or 11/10, depending on where you live.

603
00:30:53,860 --> 00:31:04,480
Rym: And because America uses a different format from basically the entire rest of the world, and this investigation crossed international boundaries, they just fucked it up real bad.

604
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:13,080
Rym: And because the technology involved is so pathetic, it actually took the family a bunch of time to like sue and figure out that that was the problem.

605
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,331
Rym: And now they're suing for damages.

606
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:15,180
Scott: Good.

607
00:31:15,761 --> 00:31:15,961
Rym: Yep.

608
00:31:16,904 --> 00:31:27,220
Rym: Moral is America, I use month, day, year because that's how almost everyone does it, because I live in America, but I recognize that it is utterly, utterly stupid to do month, day, year.

609
00:31:27,701 --> 00:31:28,143
Scott: I don't do that.

610
00:31:28,163 --> 00:31:32,140
Scott: I use, at least whenever I have the opportunity, I use year, month, day.

611
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:32,461
Rym: Oh yeah.

612
00:31:32,522 --> 00:31:34,250
Rym: If it's mine, I'm year, month, day.

613
00:31:34,411 --> 00:31:36,180
Rym: Everything I do, all my files, year, month, day.

614
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,230
Scott: All of GeekNights is year, month, day.

615
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,556
Scott: It's like perfect order.

616
00:31:39,596 --> 00:31:40,380
Scott: You can't go wrong.

617
00:31:40,501 --> 00:31:41,266
Scott: It's always unique.

618
00:31:41,307 --> 00:31:42,274
Scott: It's always exactly right.

619
00:31:42,294 --> 00:31:44,150
Scott: There's never confusion, no matter where you live in the world.

620
00:31:44,191 --> 00:31:45,060
Scott: If I go year, month, day.

621
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:49,419
Rym: In fact, I can use that string of numbers as my database key if I really need to.

622
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:50,504
Scott: That's right.

623
00:31:50,544 --> 00:31:53,366
Scott: It's year, month, day, as long as you don't have more than one thing happening on the same day.

624
00:31:53,487 --> 00:31:54,194
Rym: Yep, exactly.

625
00:31:54,255 --> 00:31:54,700
Rym: Which we do.

626
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,676
Scott: And you just go year, month, day, hour, million, minute, second, millisecond.

627
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,380
Scott: From big to small.

628
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,796
Scott: You can't go wrong with big to small.

629
00:31:59,917 --> 00:32:00,059
Scott: Yep.

630
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:00,521
Scott: Right?

631
00:32:00,581 --> 00:32:04,658
Scott: DNS, com, dot, com, Google, www.

632
00:32:06,702 --> 00:32:07,225
Scott: Big to small.

633
00:32:08,131 --> 00:32:10,905
Rym: And in one last really, really small news too.

634
00:32:11,247 --> 00:32:12,975
Rym: Way back, we mentioned this.

635
00:32:13,035 --> 00:32:15,586
Rym: We didn't really follow up on it, but I think it's newsworthy.

636
00:32:16,569 --> 00:32:17,232
Rym: Well, way back.

637
00:32:17,412 --> 00:32:18,657
Rym: Oh my God, this wasn't that long ago.

638
00:32:18,677 --> 00:32:19,380
Rym: This was in July.

639
00:32:21,561 --> 00:32:21,963
Rym: Let's see.

640
00:32:22,225 --> 00:32:24,760
Scott: So basically, last year- You can't even know your own news.

641
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,027
Rym: Firefox, I was looking for the date of this news.

642
00:32:27,288 --> 00:32:33,348
Rym: Last year in March 2019, totally different world, 1000 years ago, Mozilla, Firefox.

643
00:32:34,051 --> 00:32:35,294
Rym: Firefox had a cool feature.

644
00:32:35,716 --> 00:32:37,120
Rym: You can just send a file to anyone.

645
00:32:37,661 --> 00:32:37,862
Scott: Yep.

646
00:32:37,902 --> 00:32:38,666
Scott: Firefox send.

647
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:46,127
Scott: It was this really cool website where- Because for some reason, you know, back in the day when you would just- You're on the internet, sending files should be the easiest thing in the world.

648
00:32:46,187 --> 00:32:47,495
Scott: You have a computer.

649
00:32:47,515 --> 00:32:49,164
Scott: The other person has a computer wanting to send a file.

650
00:32:49,626 --> 00:32:51,153
Scott: It's a pain in the ass, right?

651
00:32:51,194 --> 00:32:55,432
Scott: Because you have to form a direct connection and no one has their own- Like you have to open ports.

652
00:32:55,492 --> 00:32:56,737
Scott: Everyone has a NAT router.

653
00:32:57,018 --> 00:33:00,391
Scott: Just sending a file directly to someone else is hard, right?

654
00:33:00,652 --> 00:33:02,258
Scott: You need some sort of intermediary.

655
00:33:02,499 --> 00:33:06,133
Scott: Most people use Dropbox or Google Drive or something like that these days.

656
00:33:06,535 --> 00:33:09,046
Scott: Back in the day, we'd use AOL Instant Messenger or ICQ.

657
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:12,283
Rym: You could just drag a file- I used to transfer a lot of files via ICQ.

658
00:33:12,303 --> 00:33:13,730
Rym: That's how I did a lot of my piracy as a kid.

659
00:33:13,951 --> 00:33:15,680
Scott: They don't let you do that anymore, right?

660
00:33:16,541 --> 00:33:19,757
Scott: The peer-to-peer file sharing networks, those aren't too much of a thing.

661
00:33:19,777 --> 00:33:20,822
Scott: They're still out there, right?

662
00:33:20,883 --> 00:33:23,737
Scott: But sending a file directly to another person is not as easy.

663
00:33:23,797 --> 00:33:25,244
Scott: It used to be email attachment.

664
00:33:25,264 --> 00:33:26,531
Scott: You got limitations, right?

665
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:26,893
Scott: Yep.

666
00:33:26,913 --> 00:33:28,159
Rym: So, Firefox made this cool thing.

667
00:33:28,219 --> 00:33:28,842
Rym: It was encrypted.

668
00:33:28,942 --> 00:33:30,970
Rym: It uploads the files, just like upload it.

669
00:33:31,211 --> 00:33:33,360
Scott: It's completely anonymous, completely free.

670
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,488
Scott: There was a limit on size, but that's it.

671
00:33:35,508 --> 00:33:36,593
Scott: You go to Firefox send.

672
00:33:36,653 --> 00:33:37,436
Scott: You drag a file.

673
00:33:37,577 --> 00:33:38,762
Scott: It uploads to a server.

674
00:33:39,043 --> 00:33:39,424
Scott: You send.

675
00:33:39,444 --> 00:33:40,488
Scott: It creates a URL.

676
00:33:40,709 --> 00:33:42,054
Scott: You send someone the URL.

677
00:33:42,295 --> 00:33:48,502
Scott: That URL lets another person download the file one time, and then they get rid of the file so they don't fill up their server, right?

678
00:33:48,522 --> 00:33:49,467
Scott: With hard drive space.

679
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:51,175
Scott: You get that file out of here.

680
00:33:51,215 --> 00:33:56,492
Scott: It's already been downloaded or whatever, and now you don't need an account.

681
00:33:56,553 --> 00:33:57,657
Scott: You don't need anything.

682
00:33:57,677 --> 00:34:02,800
Scott: You can just send files to anyone very easily unless your file is enormous, in which case you'll figure out something else.

683
00:34:03,301 --> 00:34:03,522
Rym: Yep.

684
00:34:04,344 --> 00:34:13,860
Rym: So, 4,000 years ago on July 17th, 2020, they suddenly shut this service down, and we found out about it because Scott tried to send me a file, and he was like, "Oh, I think Firefox send doesn't work

685
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:14,283
Rym: anymore.".

686
00:34:15,045 --> 00:34:18,480
Scott: Yeah, we used it to send GeekNights recordings back and forth because why not?

687
00:34:18,801 --> 00:34:26,543
Rym: So, they shut it down basically because people were using it to send malware to other people to trick them.

688
00:34:27,206 --> 00:34:27,648
Scott: Exactly.

689
00:34:27,688 --> 00:34:36,304
Scott: What you would do is you would upload a malware to Firefox send, and then you would send someone a phishing email or some other kind of email, trick them into clicking on this link.

690
00:34:36,706 --> 00:34:38,956
Scott: You don't need to own any servers to host your malware.

691
00:34:39,157 --> 00:34:41,545
Scott: There's no way you can be taken down, right?

692
00:34:42,348 --> 00:34:44,014
Scott: You don't have a server to take down.

693
00:34:44,054 --> 00:34:45,058
Scott: You're nothing, right?

694
00:34:45,379 --> 00:34:49,135
Scott: You're just someone sending a message to someone else on the internet with a link, right?

695
00:34:49,777 --> 00:34:51,264
Scott: You don't need any accounts for that.

696
00:34:51,284 --> 00:34:52,752
Scott: You can't be traced in any way.

697
00:34:52,812 --> 00:34:54,179
Scott: It's really hard to find out who did that.

698
00:34:55,762 --> 00:34:56,626
Rym: And that was part of the goal.

699
00:34:56,827 --> 00:35:00,987
Rym: Firefox send was partly a goal to be able to privately and securely just send files to people.

700
00:35:01,127 --> 00:35:01,569
Rym: Yeah.

701
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:04,521
Scott: So, now somebody gets an email or who knows what, right?

702
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:05,224
Scott: They click a link.

703
00:35:05,466 --> 00:35:13,080
Scott: They download a malware from Firefox, a completely trusted website, and they run it, some exe, and it's a malware that messes up their computer.

704
00:35:14,003 --> 00:35:15,187
Scott: And we have no idea who did it.

705
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:16,532
Scott: Yeah.

706
00:35:16,552 --> 00:35:21,790
Scott: And so Firefox is like, well, people, we have a service that's being misused for evil.

707
00:35:22,071 --> 00:35:26,266
Scott: If we keep this up, evil will continue to abuse it and go unpunished.

708
00:35:26,828 --> 00:35:29,880
Scott: So we don't want to continue to provide that service for evil.

709
00:35:30,281 --> 00:35:35,763
Scott: Let's shut the service down because we have no way to provide this service without providing an evil shield.

710
00:35:36,165 --> 00:35:42,011
Rym: Oh, so in this article, someone, they posted a link to a tweet that someone's like, hey, Firefox is being used for this malware.

711
00:35:42,233 --> 00:35:43,520
Rym: Can you add a report abuse button?

712
00:35:44,081 --> 00:35:49,640
Rym: But the account that reported it is called Lena inverse and it's ad inverted Lena.

713
00:35:50,501 --> 00:35:50,943
Scott: Very nice.

714
00:35:50,963 --> 00:35:51,344
Rym: That's cute.

715
00:35:52,127 --> 00:35:52,287
Rym: Yeah.

716
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:55,740
Rym: But the problem is, how do you have a report abuse button?

717
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:59,114
Rym: The file is gone, but they don't have it anymore.

718
00:35:59,194 --> 00:36:04,720
Scott: By the time you could send it, you could theoretically send them the URL of like, hey, this is the URL that sent me a malware.

719
00:36:04,921 --> 00:36:05,262
Scott: Yeah.

720
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:08,957
Scott: And then they could figure out like what IP address uploaded that malware.

721
00:36:09,198 --> 00:36:12,392
Scott: That IP address just using some VPN service or who knows what.

722
00:36:12,432 --> 00:36:12,593
Scott: Right.

723
00:36:12,674 --> 00:36:13,337
Scott: It's like, OK.

724
00:36:13,357 --> 00:36:17,520
Rym: But they also like wouldn't be able to verify, like, was that file really on that link because they don't keep it anymore?

725
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:18,765
Scott: Was that a malware?

726
00:36:18,845 --> 00:36:19,207
Scott: I don't know.

727
00:36:19,287 --> 00:36:20,151
Scott: Was it a child porn?

728
00:36:20,171 --> 00:36:20,733
Scott: I don't know.

729
00:36:20,954 --> 00:36:21,236
Scott: Right.

730
00:36:21,437 --> 00:36:21,658
Rym: Yep.

731
00:36:21,698 --> 00:36:23,947
Rym: So clearly, and this has been the problem for all of time.

732
00:36:23,987 --> 00:36:30,651
Rym: The reason this feature does not exist is that it is it will be used for very good, secure private things.

733
00:36:31,113 --> 00:36:33,280
Rym: It will also be used for horrible things.

734
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:38,720
Rym: There's really no way to prevent the latter with a secure file transfer system ever.

735
00:36:39,381 --> 00:36:40,125
Rym: They just can't do it.

736
00:36:40,909 --> 00:36:42,678
Rym: That's why it doesn't really exist in a lot of places.

737
00:36:42,738 --> 00:36:44,726
Rym: And Dropbox gets abused heavily as well.

738
00:36:45,187 --> 00:36:47,275
Rym: So I was looking around.

739
00:36:47,295 --> 00:36:49,220
Scott: The Dropbox at least is not anonymous, right?

740
00:36:49,241 --> 00:36:55,169
Scott: The Dropbox employees and can look around and be like, oh, it is a Dropbox full of child porn unless we know who to send to jail right now.

741
00:36:55,189 --> 00:36:55,551
Scott: Yeah.

742
00:36:56,054 --> 00:36:57,922
Scott: And we won't get it wrong like Spain or whatever.

743
00:36:59,306 --> 00:37:05,144
Rym: So I'm looking at the Firefox website and they actually have like an update about Firefox send.

744
00:37:05,986 --> 00:37:07,431
Scott: What's the date on the update?

745
00:37:07,451 --> 00:37:08,374
Rym: I can't find a date.

746
00:37:09,077 --> 00:37:09,578
Scott: Okay, great.

747
00:37:09,598 --> 00:37:10,702
Rym: Doesn't actually show a date.

748
00:37:10,742 --> 00:37:12,246
Rym: It's on support.mozilla.org.

749
00:37:12,507 --> 00:37:14,292
Rym: What happens to Firefox send?

750
00:37:15,856 --> 00:37:22,538
Rym: So basically they said it's temporarily down while we work on improvements and they're going to try to do two things.

751
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,965
Rym: One, improve abuse reporting.

752
00:37:25,226 --> 00:37:28,255
Rym: and two, the requirement that users have a Firefox account.

753
00:37:29,258 --> 00:37:30,964
Rym: I am confident, maybe I'm wrong.

754
00:37:31,104 --> 00:37:40,880
Rym: I like to be optimistic here, but I'm pretty confident this will not solve the problem and that there is no way to offer this kind of service and actually solve that problem.

755
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:46,782
Rym: Because now the people who are sending malware just have to do an extra step, make fake Firefox accounts.

756
00:37:47,043 --> 00:37:51,804
Rym: And if they make it hard to make a Firefox account, then people are going to get Firefox accounts.

757
00:37:52,045 --> 00:37:54,054
Rym: If they make it hard to do the file transfer.

758
00:37:54,074 --> 00:38:01,007
Scott: I think the Firefox account already has, you know, the same kind of protections that you have against making a Google account or a account, right?

759
00:38:01,208 --> 00:38:03,220
Scott: Not like a Twitter account where you can just make them more easily.

760
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,208
Scott: Facebook, you can make them kind of easily.

761
00:38:05,509 --> 00:38:07,378
Scott: Google is a little harder than that, right?

762
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:07,579
Scott: Yeah.

763
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:12,061
Scott: You know, the similar thing is you got to go through some captchas and you got to go see some other rigmarole.

764
00:38:12,102 --> 00:38:14,731
Rym: I do have like five Google accounts when I think about it.

765
00:38:14,771 --> 00:38:15,153
Scott: Yeah.

766
00:38:15,173 --> 00:38:17,844
Scott: You know, you know how it is, right?

767
00:38:17,904 --> 00:38:24,572
Scott: You know, it's, it's, it's a pretty good, but not perfect shield against just someone, you know, just not having any account at all.

768
00:38:24,632 --> 00:38:29,252
Scott: I was like, but it's interesting that imagine if you could tweet with no account, right?

769
00:38:29,272 --> 00:38:33,848
Scott: Like Twitter, where any, you could send any HTTP request that the website receives at tweets.

770
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:47,369
Rym: So I guess that the moral of this one is one of the things that most people want on the internet and would use in good faith for good things like a killer app of the internet.

771
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:54,592
Rym: People were, it's been obvious from the beginning of the internet, barely exists and basically can't be offered.

772
00:38:54,652 --> 00:38:59,644
Rym: unless society is willing to accept all the evil ways.

773
00:38:59,705 --> 00:39:02,111
Rym: someone might use this very simple technology.

774
00:39:04,657 --> 00:39:06,402
Rym: And there's almost just really no way around that.

775
00:39:07,606 --> 00:39:15,160
Rym: Like you can't heuristically analyze the files people are uploading to see if they're malware because then you're violating the privacy and defeating the purpose of the feature.

776
00:39:17,201 --> 00:39:21,240
Rym: So we'll see, I don't know if Firefox send is ever going to come back or not, to be honest.

777
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:29,760
Scott: And I've been really, you know, and since we've not, since we've been unable to use it, we've been sending back the files using Google drive, you know, and it's actually way, way faster.

778
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,041
Scott: Yep.

779
00:39:30,142 --> 00:39:33,159
Rym: It is actually a lot faster and easier and we're just using Google drive now.

780
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,201
Scott: Yep.

781
00:39:34,482 --> 00:39:35,406
Rym: Because we both have accounts.

782
00:39:35,466 --> 00:39:39,704
Rym: It just works, but it doesn't serve the same purpose as just send a file to someone.

783
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:42,074
Rym: It's more like Scott has an online cloud account.

784
00:39:42,676 --> 00:39:44,122
Rym: I have my own online cloud account.

785
00:39:44,705 --> 00:39:46,090
Rym: Scott shares a file with me.

786
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:50,325
Rym: I can go to Scott's online cloud account and download that file from his thing.

787
00:39:50,345 --> 00:39:51,329
Rym: Yep.

788
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:58,367
Rym: Which is fine for us, but imagine trying to explain that to your grandma compared to just tell them use Firefox and type my email address.

789
00:40:00,872 --> 00:40:07,224
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

790
00:40:07,285 --> 00:40:07,987
Rym: What do you got?

791
00:40:08,569 --> 00:40:26,473
Scott: So, you know, nerds often have this fantasy, especially nerds that live in a place where the selection of internet service providers is awful or limited to one or zero, or they live in a place where the internet service providers are offering very slow or crappy service or pretty much most of the United States, right?

792
00:40:26,533 --> 00:40:29,144
Scott: The internet service providers are offering slow, expensive service.

793
00:40:29,606 --> 00:40:30,449
Scott: They're too far away.

794
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:33,239
Scott: We have a friend who has a really good ISP.

795
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:39,248
Scott: That's a mile down the road who won't run fiber the one mile down the road to his house because it's only one, there's only one house, right?

796
00:40:39,288 --> 00:40:41,620
Scott: It's like, you know, cut the amount of money that costs.

797
00:40:42,141 --> 00:40:42,502
Rym: Close.

798
00:40:43,244 --> 00:40:44,066
Scott: Yep, exactly.

799
00:40:44,628 --> 00:40:49,560
Scott: Um, so this dude, Jared mouch, I hope I pronouncing your name properly.

800
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,666
Scott: Jared has a, as a little YouTube channel here.

801
00:40:51,686 --> 00:40:57,123
Scott: Um, and Jared out in a rural ish looking location, right?

802
00:40:57,625 --> 00:40:59,151
Scott: Um, you know, not too rural.

803
00:40:59,231 --> 00:41:01,320
Scott: It's like, if you look at, he shows a map of where he lives.

804
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:09,371
Scott: He's like where his house is his farms, but like a couple roads away, but those are, you know, couple blocks away being rural blocks, right?

805
00:41:09,431 --> 00:41:10,595
Scott: Not city blocks, right?

806
00:41:11,057 --> 00:41:15,980
Scott: Are like, you know, suburban developments with, you know, cul de sacs and a whole bunch of cookie cutter houses, right?

807
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,409
Scott: So there's definitely people in the area, right?

808
00:41:18,449 --> 00:41:20,578
Scott: They're just not right on his doorstep.

809
00:41:20,658 --> 00:41:21,020
Scott: Exactly.

810
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:26,177
Scott: Um, he was mad because yeah, the only ISP he could get was slow as shit.

811
00:41:26,397 --> 00:41:28,505
Scott: He was using like a wireless ISP.

812
00:41:28,545 --> 00:41:29,629
Scott: That's all he could get really.

813
00:41:29,669 --> 00:41:33,703
Scott: That was slow and meh, but you know, it's what he had, right?

814
00:41:34,304 --> 00:41:41,448
Scott: He goes and he puts in several years of labor and pile and you know, a large amount of money, hundreds of thousands of dollars.

815
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:47,690
Scott: and he does the work and he learns his shit and he sets up his own internet service provider.

816
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:52,727
Scott: He lays fiber, he hooks up, he gets customers to sign up and pay in advance.

817
00:41:53,229 --> 00:41:58,451
Scott: And then presumably once the things are up, they'll just have free service until that advanced payment runs out.

818
00:41:58,491 --> 00:41:58,712
Scott: Right.

819
00:41:58,953 --> 00:42:01,203
Scott: But he needs that money upfront to get things going.

820
00:42:01,946 --> 00:42:11,280
Scott: You know, he, you know, the support, the equipment, the hookups to the, to the actual internet, property owners to let you like run fiber through their property.

821
00:42:12,421 --> 00:42:25,680
Scott: Dealing with the city and you know, getting a stop work orders and the other utilities, not accidentally busting the gas line when you're digging and like everything he gets it done.

822
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:31,660
Scott: He's online as of September, 2020 and here is the 34 minute YouTube video.

823
00:42:32,221 --> 00:42:33,986
Scott: He breaks it down.

824
00:42:34,106 --> 00:42:35,751
Scott: He breaks everything down.

825
00:42:36,132 --> 00:42:36,934
Scott: He got it done.

826
00:42:37,035 --> 00:42:44,020
Scott: So if you've got that many years and that much money to invest and you want to start an internet service provider, right?

827
00:42:44,681 --> 00:42:45,583
Scott: It can be done.

828
00:42:45,603 --> 00:42:47,790
Scott: You could do it right.

829
00:42:48,612 --> 00:42:53,890
Scott: If I was in New York, it would be way, way harder because underground is way more of a mess than he's.

830
00:42:53,951 --> 00:42:56,841
Scott: He's like, oops, I cut one wire in a dirt field, right?

831
00:42:56,961 --> 00:42:57,924
Scott: It's like, yeah.

832
00:42:58,706 --> 00:43:08,754
Scott: But yeah, buying fiber, having your, you know, machines that you left out at the work site, stolen hiring contractors to dig stuff.

833
00:43:08,914 --> 00:43:12,027
Scott: It's like, you know, just the amount of shit you had to go through.

834
00:43:12,067 --> 00:43:14,481
Scott: It's like, we knew that that was the kind of shit you had to go through.

835
00:43:14,722 --> 00:43:18,462
Scott: And that's why we never even thought of, we're like, we started, we stopped before we started.

836
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:20,533
Scott: We ain't even going down this road, right?

837
00:43:20,553 --> 00:43:22,062
Scott: We're like, we see all that shit in advance.

838
00:43:22,082 --> 00:43:23,146
Scott: We're not even going to touch it.

839
00:43:23,408 --> 00:43:27,464
Scott: We're just going to suffer with shit ISP or move to where this good ISP, right?

840
00:43:27,785 --> 00:43:36,271
Scott: But nope, Jared here, he said he saw all those obstacles in the way and he put in so much time and effort to chop them all down.

841
00:43:36,853 --> 00:43:37,776
Scott: Good job, Jared.

842
00:43:37,796 --> 00:43:48,667
Scott: I hope this video paves the way for someone else to do the same because a world with many small Jared ISPs is way better than a world with a few big ones.

843
00:43:49,148 --> 00:43:56,031
Scott: And it's amazing to see that like, when he started, he had a couple megabit right from his wireless, whatever.

844
00:43:56,051 --> 00:43:56,774
Scott: Right.

845
00:43:57,015 --> 00:44:02,695
Scott: And he got his shit finally hooked up and he goes to like speed test and it's like 700 megabit.

846
00:44:02,755 --> 00:44:06,750
Scott: And he's like, could you imagine that feeling of working on this, right?

847
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:10,102
Scott: Living in a farm somewhere where there's no shit, no good internet.

848
00:44:10,424 --> 00:44:17,275
Scott: And you're, and you're an internet person and you're suffering with like two megabit for years and knowing that you just did it yourself like that.

849
00:44:17,295 --> 00:44:23,221
Scott: You put in so much, you put in so much time and work and you have customers too, who are going to be using this, right?

850
00:44:23,743 --> 00:44:31,347
Scott: And use one day you turn it on and it's just 700 megabit of real internet, not some garbo Verizon internet, right?

851
00:44:31,367 --> 00:44:33,916
Scott: It's like, damn, that's some good shit.

852
00:44:33,936 --> 00:44:37,654
Rym: So you can love this slide on like the cost breakdown because he has a little bit at the end.

853
00:44:37,674 --> 00:44:40,145
Scott: That's like, maybe it's how he breaks it all down.

854
00:44:40,205 --> 00:44:41,711
Scott: He breaks it all down, right?

855
00:44:41,771 --> 00:44:43,337
Rym: But there's the line of this.

856
00:44:43,418 --> 00:44:46,250
Rym: might've actually been cheaper than moving to a place with better internet.

857
00:44:46,773 --> 00:44:50,249
Scott: Yeah, it probably was, you know, especially since he was getting income too, right?

858
00:44:50,289 --> 00:44:51,717
Scott: It's not just all costs, right?

859
00:44:51,737 --> 00:45:01,028
Rym: He's eventually going to get money from, you know, what's cool is this also really shows the, like a lot of nerds in particular, especially tech nerds.

860
00:45:02,212 --> 00:45:05,982
Rym: They get this impression that things are pretty straightforward and easy.

861
00:45:06,023 --> 00:45:09,852
Rym: Like building something big is as easy as building something small.

862
00:45:09,892 --> 00:45:19,360
Rym: It like multiplication of concerns as you rise in scale of what you're trying to build.

863
00:45:19,821 --> 00:45:38,308
Rym: And the fact that this video breaks it down, this is like, I, this is almost like required viewing for someone who's a sophomore in a tech school to be like, yo kid, just because you learn how to write, I'd like net code for a trivial game does not mean that you now understand why net code is bad on a steam game.

864
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:39,873
Rym: That's gigantic, right?

865
00:45:39,914 --> 00:45:41,700
Scott: And this is how all projects go, right?

866
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:44,413
Scott: You have to realize no matter what you're working on, right?

867
00:45:44,493 --> 00:45:47,447
Scott: It's like, okay, you make a Gundam on your desk, a little plastic one.

868
00:45:47,728 --> 00:45:50,400
Scott: You want to make that giant Gundam that they have in Japan, right?

869
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:51,222
Rym: It's not just bigger.

870
00:45:51,604 --> 00:45:53,732
Scott: That's one, one scale, right?

871
00:45:53,952 --> 00:45:54,494
Scott: Guess what?

872
00:45:54,615 --> 00:45:57,626
Scott: It's not just, it's not just the same thing, only bigger, right?

873
00:45:58,028 --> 00:45:58,590
Scott: It's as hard.

874
00:45:58,651 --> 00:46:01,963
Scott: And this guy's, Oh, this is only a tiny ISP he's made, right?

875
00:46:02,344 --> 00:46:04,129
Scott: Imagine trying to be Verizon.

876
00:46:04,149 --> 00:46:08,321
Rym: I mean, that's why that's a giant, giant, giant company without.

877
00:46:08,342 --> 00:46:09,447
Rym: that's why Verizon charge.

878
00:46:09,487 --> 00:46:12,381
Scott: That's why next time Verizon charges, not to say the Verizon's good.

879
00:46:12,421 --> 00:46:12,903
Scott: Fuck them.

880
00:46:13,425 --> 00:46:20,030
Scott: But at the same time, that there's a reason they charge you a hundred bucks a month for whatever answer or more for whatever service.

881
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:20,532
Scott: I pay that.

882
00:46:20,673 --> 00:46:22,380
Rym: And you know what they give me a five.

883
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:28,490
Rym: there's fiber that comes into the front of my apartment and I'm connected to that piece of fiber and I get a shit ton of bandwidth over it.

884
00:46:28,751 --> 00:46:29,917
Rym: I don't have to worry about any of it.

885
00:46:29,937 --> 00:46:32,145
Scott: And I didn't have to, and I didn't have to do what Jared did.

886
00:46:33,549 --> 00:46:34,713
Rym: Props to Jared.

887
00:46:35,194 --> 00:46:35,615
Scott: Yeah.

888
00:46:35,696 --> 00:46:36,297
Scott: Good job, man.

889
00:46:36,698 --> 00:46:37,863
Rym: Try to get Jared on GeekNights.

890
00:46:38,446 --> 00:46:39,552
Scott: Yeah, go ahead.

891
00:46:39,572 --> 00:46:40,175
Rym: I got to watch the rest.

892
00:46:40,195 --> 00:46:42,064
Rym: I haven't watched the whole video, so I got to watch.

893
00:46:42,104 --> 00:46:43,489
Rym: It's worth it to the end.

894
00:46:44,353 --> 00:46:48,448
Rym: So I think it is a real simple little cute thing, but I bumped into this channel.

895
00:46:48,468 --> 00:46:54,153
Rym: It kind of like how recently we realized that a ton of these really good, funny animations were all from that one worth it.

896
00:46:54,193 --> 00:46:54,997
Rym: Kids YouTube channel.

897
00:46:55,017 --> 00:46:56,764
Rym: There's another little channel like that.

898
00:46:57,506 --> 00:47:03,023
Rym: Uh, the Fernanda Diaz artwork, YouTube channels got like 260,000 subscribers.

899
00:47:03,123 --> 00:47:04,088
Rym: It really should have more.

900
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:09,169
Rym: And it's all these short little like animated music videos to like snippets of songs and things.

901
00:47:09,611 --> 00:47:12,080
Rym: But this one in particular I'm linking to is called.

902
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,605
Rym: it's from the song like Morena.

903
00:47:13,625 --> 00:47:16,837
Rym: And it's just this series called Witch Bunny.

904
00:47:17,399 --> 00:47:20,530
Rym: And it's this really well animated girl with like this magic witch hat.

905
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:30,847
Rym: That's a bunny and this guy that she's there's a relationship with and he's got like a cat familiar and they're just super cute and super beautiful and well done.

906
00:47:31,269 --> 00:47:32,917
Rym: And they're just a little bright spot in your day.

907
00:47:32,937 --> 00:47:36,452
Rym: And if you enjoy this video, the whole channel is just full of this stuff.

908
00:47:36,572 --> 00:47:39,884
Rym: Like this is just really, really good, cute, simple animation.

909
00:47:41,329 --> 00:47:47,975
Rym: I'm trying to do more fun, like things they like that where I don't have like a moral or like some big thing or screed or something.

910
00:47:48,015 --> 00:47:49,240
Scott: This is just this thing of the day.

911
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:50,447
Scott: My thing of the day was just too good.

912
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:51,593
Scott: I could not put that on.

913
00:47:51,694 --> 00:47:52,740
Rym: No, no, I'm saying yours is great.

914
00:47:53,161 --> 00:48:02,960
Rym: I'm saying this is just like, it's the best thing I've seen since the last time I did a GeekNights, which was literally the words we wrote down in 2004 when we were trying to plan GeekNights.

915
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:06,552
Rym: We called, we came up with the idea of a segment called Thing of the Day.

916
00:48:06,873 --> 00:48:13,380
Rym: And the literal idea was, what was the best thing you saw on the internet since the last time we recorded a GeekNights?

917
00:48:17,325 --> 00:48:18,248
Scott: Met a moment, finally.

918
00:48:18,368 --> 00:48:19,792
Rym: Yeah, met a moment.

919
00:48:19,812 --> 00:48:20,734
Scott: All right.

920
00:48:20,754 --> 00:48:22,799
Scott: So the PAX Online is ongoing.

921
00:48:22,879 --> 00:48:24,225
Scott: It is currently PAX Online.

922
00:48:24,265 --> 00:48:25,591
Scott: We are at PAX right now.

923
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:27,499
Scott: We're literally GeekNights from PAX.

924
00:48:27,519 --> 00:48:28,282
Scott: When does this happen?

925
00:48:29,085 --> 00:48:31,413
Scott: So you can go to the PAX Online Discord.

926
00:48:31,453 --> 00:48:31,955
Scott: It's open.

927
00:48:32,256 --> 00:48:33,781
Scott: They got PAX Online on Twitch.

928
00:48:33,842 --> 00:48:35,149
Scott: They got PAX Online on YouTube.

929
00:48:35,169 --> 00:48:37,079
Scott: They got PAX Online on the PAX Online website.

930
00:48:37,099 --> 00:48:39,788
Scott: There's PAX Online on Facebook and Twitter even, I think.

931
00:48:39,909 --> 00:48:40,109
Scott: Yep.

932
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:43,901
Scott: It's PAX Online is on everywhere 24/7 until it's over.

933
00:48:44,482 --> 00:48:48,831
Scott: Our panel is New York time this Friday.

934
00:48:48,831 --> 00:48:51,295
Scott: 5 p.m 5 p.m.

935
00:48:51,516 --> 00:48:52,919
Rym: New York time, 2 p.m.

936
00:48:52,979 --> 00:48:53,620
Rym: Seattle time.

937
00:48:54,122 --> 00:48:55,708
Scott: On the PAX 3 channel.

938
00:48:55,748 --> 00:49:01,388
Scott: So go to the Discord and the YouTube or the one of those platforms where you can watch video and you'll see the panel then.

939
00:49:01,408 --> 00:49:02,372
Scott: It is a 100% new panel.

940
00:49:02,472 --> 00:49:06,345
Scott: If you know, if you hear that from me, that is true.

941
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:08,853
Scott: Actually new panel.

942
00:49:09,576 --> 00:49:11,342
Scott: And that will be the first time you can see it.

943
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:13,713
Scott: There may be a VOD up available of some kind.

944
00:49:13,753 --> 00:49:14,155
Scott: Who knows?

945
00:49:14,375 --> 00:49:15,420
Rym: We will be in the Discord.

946
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:18,656
Rym: We'll be in the PAX Discord like answering questions and chatting with you.

947
00:49:18,696 --> 00:49:27,344
Scott: Yes, we will be in the Discord appropriate channel which I believe is the one entitled Goose Theater is the third one, right?

948
00:49:27,805 --> 00:49:28,769
Rym: I'll double check.

949
00:49:29,351 --> 00:49:30,815
Scott: Stream 3 Goose Theater.

950
00:49:31,036 --> 00:49:35,330
Scott: and then when the panel's over the discussion moves to Stream 3 Continuing Discussions.

951
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:36,955
Scott: They got two channels.

952
00:49:37,036 --> 00:49:40,148
Scott: So come to the Goose Theater Discord channel.

953
00:49:40,289 --> 00:49:40,891
Scott: Chat with us.

954
00:49:40,992 --> 00:49:44,991
Rym: I think you're even going to give us a special color on our names as the panelists.

955
00:49:45,011 --> 00:49:50,632
Rym: It's basically the equivalent of the speaker badge we'd normally have during our panel and for like a couple hours afterward.

956
00:49:51,214 --> 00:49:51,414
Scott: Sure.

957
00:49:51,876 --> 00:49:57,575
Scott: And then also while you're there, you might as well join the official GeekNights Discord server.

958
00:49:57,796 --> 00:49:58,137
Scott: Yeah.

959
00:49:58,418 --> 00:50:00,506
Scott: If you have Discord, you know, come on over.

960
00:50:00,746 --> 00:50:02,955
Scott: The Twitch chat is going to be sub only.

961
00:50:03,075 --> 00:50:04,440
Scott: So just be aware of that.

962
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:06,850
Scott: I might look at it, but I don't think I can chat in it.

963
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:07,272
Scott: Yep.

964
00:50:07,292 --> 00:50:08,055
Rym: Just come to the Discord.

965
00:50:08,075 --> 00:50:10,203
Scott: If you actually have a question.

966
00:50:10,284 --> 00:50:12,772
Scott: I'm not using a Twitch sub on PAX 3, right?

967
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:14,999
Scott: So there you go.

968
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,629
Rym: I mean, back when I was a live streaming enforcer, I was on PAX 2.

969
00:50:17,629 --> 00:50:19,114
Rym: I never touched PAX 3.

970
00:50:19,114 --> 00:50:19,395
Scott: Yeah.

971
00:50:20,218 --> 00:50:21,242
Scott: Other meta moments.

972
00:50:21,262 --> 00:50:23,714
Scott: The book called Book is Still, Tale of Genji.

973
00:50:23,774 --> 00:50:25,000
Scott: I have not read another word of it.

974
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:34,006
Rym: I wonder as the weather gets cooler and I'm doing more low key outdoor activities, I might spend time sitting under a tree reading.

975
00:50:34,187 --> 00:50:34,709
Rym: So we'll see.

976
00:50:35,331 --> 00:50:38,807
Scott: My urge right now is actually to build some of these Gundams that are piling up.

977
00:50:38,887 --> 00:50:42,706
Rym: My urge is to deal with, we got other conventions we got to make panels for and announcements.

978
00:50:43,068 --> 00:50:45,620
Rym: I'm basically stuck doing GeekNights shit all week this week.

979
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,232
Scott: I also got an urge to actually write some software.

980
00:50:48,313 --> 00:50:49,841
Scott: So I might write some software, I don't know.

981
00:50:50,062 --> 00:50:50,483
Scott: Ooh.

982
00:50:50,564 --> 00:50:51,366
Scott: GeekNights website.

983
00:50:52,169 --> 00:50:53,594
Scott: I don't know.

984
00:50:53,615 --> 00:50:55,441
Rym: There's a lot of GeekNights stuff in the hopper.

985
00:50:56,506 --> 00:51:01,367
Rym: We will be doing a cool, I'll just tell you guys, I don't know when it's going to be scheduled, but it's super magwest.

986
00:51:01,407 --> 00:51:03,860
Rym: We're technically going to have our first super magwest panel.

987
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:06,873
Scott: Because we've never been to magwest, we might not ever go to magwest.

988
00:51:06,974 --> 00:51:07,235
Scott: Yeah.

989
00:51:07,255 --> 00:51:10,448
Scott: But because it's online, hey, we can do a panel at magwest.

990
00:51:10,488 --> 00:51:12,558
Rym: We're going to do, it's a variation on a theme.

991
00:51:12,598 --> 00:51:17,784
Rym: We have our panel, we don't need to record it again because we did it like perfectly a long time ago, called Play Dirty to Win.

992
00:51:18,126 --> 00:51:20,919
Scott: So you can just go watch that panel on YouTube right now, right?

993
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:21,724
Rym: Yeah, that one goes deep.

994
00:51:21,784 --> 00:51:24,499
Rym: That one we'd like, there's like a 10 minute segment where we'd look at.

995
00:51:24,519 --> 00:51:30,067
Scott: So if you're listening to this right now, there's no reason to watch our panel at magwest because it's going to be that same panel only shorter.

996
00:51:30,187 --> 00:51:32,134
Rym: Well, it's a lot shorter.

997
00:51:32,154 --> 00:51:34,081
Scott: A lot short, half as short.

998
00:51:34,081 --> 00:51:36,510
Rym: 25 minutes instead of 60 minutes.

999
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:37,453
Scott: Half as long.

1000
00:51:37,493 --> 00:51:39,942
Scott: Yeah, half as long and, you know, half as deep.

1001
00:51:40,544 --> 00:51:43,777
Scott: So just watch the YouTube video and don't bother going to magwest.

1002
00:51:44,098 --> 00:51:53,294
Rym: Well, I think the differences, like the way we got to do this is the Play Dirty to Win panel really was more about like this broader picture of like being a player of games.

1003
00:51:53,495 --> 00:51:56,928
Rym: And we talk a lot with a lot of anecdotes and a lot of details and examples.

1004
00:51:56,988 --> 00:52:00,824
Rym: And we have this sort of meta conversation about like, where's the line?

1005
00:52:01,466 --> 00:52:03,313
Rym: The short version is just, you want to win?

1006
00:52:03,594 --> 00:52:03,975
Rym: Do this.

1007
00:52:04,276 --> 00:52:04,698
Rym: Do this.

1008
00:52:04,958 --> 00:52:05,340
Rym: Do this.

1009
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:06,222
Rym: Fuck your friends.

1010
00:52:06,303 --> 00:52:06,705
Rym: Do this.

1011
00:52:06,805 --> 00:52:06,966
Rym: Like.

1012
00:52:07,006 --> 00:52:11,586
Rym: it is more like the how-to guide without any of the ethics or morals or meta commentary.

1013
00:52:12,369 --> 00:52:15,607
Scott: Okay, well I guess we have to do it because it's only giving us 30-something minutes, right?

1014
00:52:15,627 --> 00:52:17,400
Rym: Yeah, I guess we'll record it like tomorrow or Wednesday.

1015
00:52:18,401 --> 00:52:18,682
Scott: Okay.

1016
00:52:18,923 --> 00:52:21,817
Rym: Also, I'll tell you guys right now, we just watched Wolfwalkers.

1017
00:52:21,917 --> 00:52:23,163
Rym: We're going to talk about that on Wednesday.

1018
00:52:23,645 --> 00:52:33,464
Rym: If you want to watch Wolfwalkers in super high quality and you don't want to pay Apple, you can rent it on like the Toronto International Film Festival for like 15 Canadian dollar a dues.

1019
00:52:33,885 --> 00:52:35,371
Scott: Oh, I thought, oh, 19.

1020
00:52:35,371 --> 00:52:36,515
Scott: Oh, I paid less than 19.

1021
00:52:36,515 --> 00:52:37,780
Scott: I thought it was 19 was Canadian.

1022
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:38,201
Scott: Yeah.

1023
00:52:38,241 --> 00:52:40,047
Rym: Well, Canadian is not as bad as it used to be like that.

1024
00:52:40,569 --> 00:52:45,085
Scott: This is an unexpected, very small, but still not nothing.

1025
00:52:45,165 --> 00:52:53,735
Scott: Silver lining of, you know, the, the pandemic is that things going online means we now have access to things that we never had access to.

1026
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:53,996
Scott: Right.

1027
00:52:54,036 --> 00:52:56,166
Scott: It's like someone who could never go to packs ever.

1028
00:52:56,507 --> 00:52:57,794
Scott: They've never been to a single packs.

1029
00:52:57,854 --> 00:52:59,020
Scott: It wouldn't be able to get to one.

1030
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:02,416
Scott: for, you know, for us packs online is a disappointment kinda.

1031
00:53:02,476 --> 00:53:02,697
Scott: Right.

1032
00:53:02,737 --> 00:53:07,874
Scott: But for them packs online is like, Ooh, I finally get more than zero packs.

1033
00:53:08,015 --> 00:53:08,195
Scott: Right.

1034
00:53:08,236 --> 00:53:14,262
Scott: So, you know, as someone who likes going to a film festival, but has only been able to go to New York ones and not that much right.

1035
00:53:14,342 --> 00:53:19,362
Scott: As much as I would like, anyway, suddenly I'm accessing films from film festivals all over the place.

1036
00:53:19,543 --> 00:53:19,784
Scott: Right.

1037
00:53:19,844 --> 00:53:36,069
Scott: So, uh, yeah, if you don't see Wolfwalkers as part of the Toronto International Film Festival, which is available right now, as we're speaking until some undetermined time, when it's the film festivals over, you're going to have to wait until late October to supposedly get it on Apple TV plus or buy it on iTunes.

1038
00:53:36,269 --> 00:53:38,015
Scott: So yeah, that's a thing.

1039
00:53:38,155 --> 00:53:39,881
Scott: or buy a Booray or a DVD or whatever.

1040
00:53:39,901 --> 00:53:40,243
Scott: I don't know.

1041
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:40,524
Rym: Yeah.

1042
00:53:40,644 --> 00:53:45,584
Rym: I guess it'll be in theaters and non-us countries to dangerously go to a us theater.

1043
00:53:45,685 --> 00:53:45,865
Scott: Yeah.

1044
00:53:45,926 --> 00:53:48,636
Rym: I don't know how many us theaters it'll actually be.

1045
00:53:48,696 --> 00:53:54,160
Scott: And if I don't risk your life to see the movie, it's like, you know, not that it's not good, but no movie is that good.

1046
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:57,475
Rym: And there is, there is a theoretical movie that would be that good.

1047
00:53:57,495 --> 00:53:58,199
Rym: That does not exist.

1048
00:53:58,259 --> 00:54:01,876
Scott: As far as we know, that could not, I don't think any movie could be so good.

1049
00:54:01,896 --> 00:54:09,160
Rym: I would risk my life to go see what if the movie just reprograms your brain via your eyes goes to the shell style.

1050
00:54:09,861 --> 00:54:11,629
Scott: It's just a, I'd watch it at home.

1051
00:54:11,709 --> 00:54:12,031
Scott: I'd wait.

1052
00:54:12,252 --> 00:54:13,598
Rym: What if it only works in the theater?

1053
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,064
Scott: I'd build a theater.

1054
00:54:16,084 --> 00:54:16,747
Scott: Cause it's AK.

1055
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:18,294
Scott: I'd build my own theater.

1056
00:54:18,615 --> 00:54:19,600
Scott: I buy an AK screen.

1057
00:54:21,661 --> 00:54:22,647
Scott: That's worth buying it, right?

1058
00:54:22,687 --> 00:54:26,691
Scott: If it's worth that, if it's worth risking my life, it's worth spending out the money for an AK screen.

1059
00:54:26,732 --> 00:54:27,576
Rym: But yeah, serious talk.

1060
00:54:27,596 --> 00:54:31,898
Rym: Like don't go to a theater, especially if you're in the us to see any movie for the foreseeable.

1061
00:54:31,938 --> 00:54:35,936
Scott: No one listening to this is allowed to go to a movie theater until I go to a movie theater.

1062
00:54:36,619 --> 00:54:40,351
Scott: No one also, no one can go to a sporting event until I go to a sporting event.

1063
00:54:41,254 --> 00:54:42,538
Scott: That's the rule.

1064
00:54:42,939 --> 00:54:51,730
Rym: But that means you, if you take, if you take an evil and dangerous action, I'm assuming that you're all, uh, more risks takey than I am.

1065
00:54:51,770 --> 00:54:52,534
Scott: That is the assumption.

1066
00:54:52,775 --> 00:54:53,036
Rym: Yeah.

1067
00:54:53,097 --> 00:54:53,378
Rym: Yeah.

1068
00:54:53,398 --> 00:54:58,117
Rym: You are pretty on risk taking like you'll bike, but you won't buy fast downhill Rym skis.

1069
00:54:58,177 --> 00:54:58,699
Scott: I don't ski.

1070
00:54:58,739 --> 00:55:04,630
Rym: That's how come, you know, well, like Scott has a much better bike than me and can bike faster and further than me, but like on long distances.

1071
00:55:04,690 --> 00:55:08,770
Rym: But if there's a downhill, I'll always pass Scott because he will slow down a little bit for safety.

1072
00:55:08,790 --> 00:55:10,520
Rym: I basically never break on a downhill.

1073
00:55:11,261 --> 00:55:24,327
Scott: Well, I mean, my bike just, even if I don't pedal goes faster downhill, that Rym's bike, regardless of who's on it, just cause my wheels are better, but I hit the brakes and therefore like that's how it is anyway.

1074
00:55:24,507 --> 00:55:24,889
Rym: All right.

1075
00:55:24,949 --> 00:55:29,871
Rym: So software updates because we realize we never really talked about this in like a generic way.

1076
00:55:29,931 --> 00:55:31,238
Scott: I think you deleted the episode.

1077
00:55:31,278 --> 00:55:32,625
Scott: I have a vague memory of doing it.

1078
00:55:32,645 --> 00:55:35,582
Rym: The way we come up with new episodes for gig nights is I look for a show we already did.

1079
00:55:35,602 --> 00:55:36,185
Rym: That would be easy.

1080
00:55:36,245 --> 00:55:37,370
Rym: I deleted from the database.

1081
00:55:37,752 --> 00:55:38,917
Rym: I purge all records of it.

1082
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:44,193
Rym: And then tell Scott, Hey, turns out we've never done a show on anime.

1083
00:55:44,996 --> 00:55:47,103
Scott: So from the perspective of a user, right?

1084
00:55:47,143 --> 00:55:48,792
Scott: There's a lot of people out there, right?

1085
00:55:48,812 --> 00:55:50,762
Scott: Let's get to the, let's not, let's cut to the chase, right?

1086
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:54,180
Scott: So there's a lot of people out there who like, don't like to update their software.

1087
00:55:54,321 --> 00:55:55,770
Scott: They install it, they like it.

1088
00:55:55,830 --> 00:55:56,212
Scott: It works.

1089
00:55:56,253 --> 00:55:57,299
Scott: And they're like, I don't want no updates.

1090
00:55:57,319 --> 00:55:58,284
Scott: They turn the updates off.

1091
00:55:58,586 --> 00:55:59,993
Scott: They refuse to install updates.

1092
00:56:00,033 --> 00:56:01,400
Scott: They let the updates build up.

1093
00:56:01,921 --> 00:56:02,182
Scott: Right.

1094
00:56:02,584 --> 00:56:06,162
Scott: And the, you know, because, and it's understandable why some people would feel that way.

1095
00:56:06,202 --> 00:56:09,133
Scott: There have been times where updates have burned people.

1096
00:56:09,214 --> 00:56:09,977
Scott: just recently.

1097
00:56:09,997 --> 00:56:15,095
Scott: There was an update to Lightroom that caused a lot of photo data, uh, photos.

1098
00:56:15,496 --> 00:56:23,082
Scott: If you were doing things a certain way to be irrecoverably deleted, um, if you didn't have your own backups separately, right.

1099
00:56:23,684 --> 00:56:28,865
Scott: Uh, the recent, you know, a lot of people get mad when software updates and changes the user interface, right?

1100
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:30,533
Scott: They, I like old Microsoft word.

1101
00:56:30,593 --> 00:56:33,545
Scott: I don't want to use the new one with its ribbons or whatever the hell, right.

1102
00:56:33,565 --> 00:56:34,529
Scott: They don't want those updates.

1103
00:56:35,171 --> 00:56:42,917
Scott: Um, and so people refuse to install updates and they've never noticed getting burned by not updating.

1104
00:56:42,957 --> 00:56:43,218
Scott: Right.

1105
00:56:43,378 --> 00:56:47,419
Scott: But even though they have been burned, right, there may be new features that they've missed out on.

1106
00:56:47,439 --> 00:56:49,246
Scott: that realize they've missed out on.

1107
00:56:49,748 --> 00:56:54,986
Scott: And there may be security holes or other bug fixes that come in those updates that they're not aware of.

1108
00:56:55,047 --> 00:56:57,576
Scott: Maybe because they don't, uh, see the bugs.

1109
00:56:57,937 --> 00:56:59,944
Scott: Maybe they got used to the bugs.

1110
00:57:00,205 --> 00:57:04,581
Scott: Maybe the security threat, you know, happened and they just didn't realize it.

1111
00:57:04,682 --> 00:57:07,051
Scott: Or maybe they just got lucky and it was never exploited.

1112
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:10,322
Scott: Um, and so people have this attitude of not updating.

1113
00:57:11,004 --> 00:57:11,847
Scott: I think that's stupid.

1114
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:17,303
Scott: I, if I get updates, I install updates immediately and always to everything.

1115
00:57:18,186 --> 00:57:18,667
Rym: Yeah.

1116
00:57:18,687 --> 00:57:19,329
Rym: Like my windows.

1117
00:57:19,370 --> 00:57:22,720
Rym: So the only thing I'll do is like windows updates.

1118
00:57:23,021 --> 00:57:24,809
Rym: I will schedule them or defer them.

1119
00:57:24,869 --> 00:57:30,315
Scott: If I'm like in the middle of something, like obviously you restart your computer while you're in the middle of a GeekNights episode.

1120
00:57:30,335 --> 00:57:34,128
Scott: If an update comes up now, I'll run it tonight, tomorrow morning.

1121
00:57:35,392 --> 00:57:40,589
Rym: Let's say I'm editing a four hour long panel to upload to some crazy new convention.

1122
00:57:40,629 --> 00:57:41,492
Rym: Like it's a big deal.

1123
00:57:41,914 --> 00:57:43,881
Rym: And the deadline is like Saturday at midnight.

1124
00:57:44,484 --> 00:57:50,027
Rym: I'm not going to let any window up windows updates happen during that week when I'm finishing all that editing just in case.

1125
00:57:50,428 --> 00:57:53,882
Rym: But yeah, once I upload that video, windows update happens immediately.

1126
00:57:54,544 --> 00:57:54,966
Scott: That's right.

1127
00:57:55,106 --> 00:58:01,694
Rym: But most people who make a claim like that, what they're, they don't actually have like a serious thing that they're waiting for.

1128
00:58:01,814 --> 00:58:06,836
Rym: Or like they just like, they have this weird, unreasonable unwillingness to let Microsoft update their stuff.

1129
00:58:07,258 --> 00:58:09,767
Rym: Windows updates don't actually break things that often.

1130
00:58:10,410 --> 00:58:14,828
Rym: It's pretty rare unless you're in enterprise, in which case it's someone's job to deal with that.

1131
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:15,471
Scott: Exactly.

1132
00:58:15,511 --> 00:58:26,455
Scott: And if you got burned once, it's like, yeah, there's a chance of being burned by some updates as a user, but if you want to avoid being burned, right, you know, the lesson to learn is not don't update anything ever.

1133
00:58:26,516 --> 00:58:39,765
Scott: The lesson to learn is if you really, you know, are that concerned, every time there's updates, go and look at the change logs, do your research, figure out what those updates actually do, what they don't do, have other people deployed them or not.

1134
00:58:40,227 --> 00:58:41,551
Scott: Are there any known bugs in them?

1135
00:58:41,932 --> 00:58:42,193
Scott: Right.

1136
00:58:42,615 --> 00:58:45,785
Scott: And then decide whether to install the updates, right.

1137
00:58:46,065 --> 00:58:46,787
Scott: Or not, right.

1138
00:58:47,008 --> 00:58:54,232
Rym: Of course the or not is tricky because one thing that can happen, like I used to manage this stuff in an ancient time.

1139
00:58:54,533 --> 00:58:58,590
Rym: It's funny nowadays, I don't know shit about how Windows subsystems work anymore.

1140
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:03,713
Rym: Like I'm Googling like everybody else because I don't like have to deal with it much except on my workstation at home.

1141
00:59:04,095 --> 00:59:05,943
Rym: But there was a time when that was my job.

1142
00:59:06,364 --> 00:59:14,149
Rym: So I had a situation once at an employer where there was a Windows update, that Windows update broke some critical software that's old.

1143
00:59:15,534 --> 00:59:19,184
Rym: There's no way to make that update not break that software.

1144
00:59:20,608 --> 00:59:26,807
Rym: And the software would have to be fixed or Microsoft would have to change something about the nature of that update.

1145
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:28,816
Rym: The latter is not going to happen 99% of the time.

1146
00:59:31,121 --> 00:59:34,435
Rym: So in that situation, it can be a tricky decision.

1147
00:59:34,475 --> 00:59:40,258
Rym: Like I couldn't just say, well, all the Windows machines in this factory will never get a Windows update again.

1148
00:59:40,278 --> 00:59:42,087
Rym: That is not the right answer.

1149
00:59:42,388 --> 00:59:44,800
Rym: But that seems to end up being the answer in many cases.

1150
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:45,861
Scott: Yep.

1151
00:59:46,603 --> 00:59:57,057
Rym: The problem is what is the right answer is highly specific to you and your exact situation, but generally it involves come up with something clever or make a VM.

1152
00:59:58,881 --> 00:59:59,082
Scott: Yep.

1153
01:00:00,167 --> 01:00:09,480
Scott: Another thing is, you know, when I say install updates immediately, right, you have to remember I'm talking about updates that are stable, you know, release updates.

1154
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:10,001
Rym: Yeah.

1155
01:00:10,021 --> 01:00:21,104
Rym: Don't subscribe your production like Linux server that you do stuff on to like the bleeding every commit someone, a lot of large software projects, you know, have different levels of updating windows.

1156
01:00:21,164 --> 01:00:24,156
Scott: For example, you can get regular standard updates.

1157
01:00:24,216 --> 01:00:32,294
Scott: You can get like, you know, I think there's like two or three levels of like, I want the new hotness update windows every night with the brand new code that hasn't been fully tested yet.

1158
01:00:32,375 --> 01:00:32,515
Scott: Right.

1159
01:00:32,556 --> 01:00:35,570
Scott: It's like, don't do that unless you're a windows developer, right.

1160
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:40,210
Scott: You're working on windows itself, and then you need those updates, you know, good for your windows software.

1161
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:50,546
Scott: But you know, if you're just a user, always subscribe to the stable updates, the most tested ones that other people have already put through their paces or whatever.

1162
01:00:50,707 --> 01:00:50,928
Scott: Right.

1163
01:00:51,570 --> 01:00:58,300
Scott: And you know, people might be like not trusting someone who's sending down updates, but it's like, well, but you're using their software.

1164
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:02,075
Scott: You trusted them enough to put their software on your computer.

1165
01:01:02,135 --> 01:01:03,501
Rym: That's the people I don't get the most.

1166
01:01:03,722 --> 01:01:14,606
Scott: They're already all in like, it's like, okay, you don't trust Chrome to auto to send some, you don't want to turn on the auto updates because you don't trust Google to like not do something evil to Chrome.

1167
01:01:14,666 --> 01:01:14,847
Scott: Right.

1168
01:01:14,887 --> 01:01:17,500
Scott: But you trust them to put Chrome on your computer already.

1169
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:18,544
Scott: You're already in the hole.

1170
01:01:19,006 --> 01:01:19,146
Scott: Right.

1171
01:01:19,166 --> 01:01:20,833
Scott: You're already in the hole with that.

1172
01:01:21,435 --> 01:01:23,324
Scott: There's no point in turning off the updates.

1173
01:01:23,384 --> 01:01:25,534
Scott: Now you're already, you already gave into them.

1174
01:01:25,555 --> 01:01:28,208
Scott: If you don't trust them, you shouldn't install that Chrome in the first place.

1175
01:01:28,570 --> 01:01:39,826
Rym: Then you have the people who then at least you're consistent, but then you have the people who like the UI or UX of something and they don't like changes that were made to it.

1176
01:01:40,147 --> 01:01:45,729
Rym: And they just decide arbitrarily from this point forward, I will never update my software again.

1177
01:01:45,749 --> 01:01:49,824
Rym: And those are the people that today are still asking questions in forums.

1178
01:01:49,924 --> 01:01:56,203
Rym: Like how do I get Adobe premiere CS4 to like not crash when I export this video?

1179
01:01:56,444 --> 01:01:57,127
Rym: because I have all that.

1180
01:01:57,489 --> 01:01:58,915
Rym: So there's a little difference there.

1181
01:01:58,955 --> 01:01:59,156
Scott: Right.

1182
01:01:59,277 --> 01:02:03,276
Scott: So we've been talking so far about just like patches to your existing software.

1183
01:02:03,296 --> 01:02:03,416
Scott: Right.

1184
01:02:03,537 --> 01:02:10,180
Scott: It's like, I have Windows 10, you know, but like someone who has Windows 7, Windows 10 is not just an auto update.

1185
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:10,901
Scott: Right.

1186
01:02:10,921 --> 01:02:15,156
Scott: If you have, you know, I don't know what's not an auto update these days.

1187
01:02:15,176 --> 01:02:17,826
Scott: A lot of things these days are just auto updates.

1188
01:02:18,207 --> 01:02:22,926
Rym: Especially like consumer software, like your Twitter app on your phone just updates itself.

1189
01:02:22,946 --> 01:02:27,565
Scott: But I guess Microsoft, I guess the office even now is like office 365 or whatever.

1190
01:02:27,826 --> 01:02:29,896
Rym: You can't have the like regular installed office too.

1191
01:02:29,936 --> 01:02:30,057
Rym: Yeah.

1192
01:02:30,077 --> 01:02:30,600
Scott: They're worse.

1193
01:02:30,821 --> 01:02:41,477
Scott: There are still some software projects out there where there is a clear division of like, okay, you know, this is this version and it is updating, but now here's a new release.

1194
01:02:41,537 --> 01:02:46,597
Scott: It's actually a different sort of updated, better, different thing, but it's still the same thing.

1195
01:02:46,818 --> 01:02:51,932
Scott: The way that, you know, Windows 95 is not Windows 3.1 the way that Adobe CS4 is not CS2.

1196
01:02:52,394 --> 01:02:52,654
Scott: Right.

1197
01:02:53,677 --> 01:02:57,108
Scott: So for those situations, it's like, do you upgrade?

1198
01:02:57,148 --> 01:02:57,429
Scott: Right.

1199
01:02:57,690 --> 01:03:02,465
Scott: Because now upgrading is not some automatic free thing that you just get.

1200
01:03:02,906 --> 01:03:03,207
Scott: Right.

1201
01:03:03,648 --> 01:03:11,329
Scott: It's a, you have to actively choose to switch from the one you're on to the next one, pay money possibly.

1202
01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:11,951
Scott: Right.

1203
01:03:12,211 --> 01:03:22,305
Scott: So doing that switch, I think is basically, you know, especially if it costs money, you have to consider that as just, you know, not an update, but as a new thing.

1204
01:03:22,446 --> 01:03:28,028
Rym: And the question though is where is the line between like, when do I replace my, when do I replace my car?

1205
01:03:28,228 --> 01:03:28,409
Scott: Right.

1206
01:03:28,469 --> 01:03:34,556
Scott: It's like, if your car, you know, if you're getting a free radio, that's better than your current radio, that's an update.

1207
01:03:34,596 --> 01:03:34,797
Scott: Right.

1208
01:03:34,878 --> 01:03:44,869
Scott: But it's like, I drive a 2000 X Honda, whatever, and I'm going to switch to a 3000 X Honda, whatever, because the car was managed to last a hundred years before it broke.

1209
01:03:45,390 --> 01:03:45,712
Scott: Right.

1210
01:03:45,772 --> 01:03:57,777
Scott: It's like, look at Adobe software now, because now that a subscription, instead of paying for it, you basically just subscription versus, you know, uh, pay for the one thing is, or is a completely different topic.

1211
01:03:57,837 --> 01:03:58,319
Rym: Oh yeah.

1212
01:03:58,479 --> 01:04:04,239
Rym: But when you're subscribed to it now, it is just like little updates come over time forever.

1213
01:04:05,262 --> 01:04:09,924
Rym: And there are people who still resist those updates the same way that they resist the Microsoft updates.

1214
01:04:10,044 --> 01:04:10,185
Scott: Yeah.

1215
01:04:10,225 --> 01:04:20,748
Scott: Those, once you're like, you know, we can put off the subscription versus not discussion to some other episode, but once you're in the subscription zone, it's like all those updates are what you're paying for.

1216
01:04:20,768 --> 01:04:22,878
Scott: You're you have it, you're paying for it already.

1217
01:04:22,898 --> 01:04:23,019
Scott: Yep.

1218
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:23,541
Scott: Right.

1219
01:04:23,782 --> 01:04:24,887
Scott: You're turning off those updates.

1220
01:04:24,907 --> 01:04:26,574
Scott: You're basically throwing away your money.

1221
01:04:26,594 --> 01:04:31,451
Scott: A and B like, most of those updates are new fancy features, not bug fixes.

1222
01:04:31,512 --> 01:04:31,692
Rym: Yep.

1223
01:04:31,953 --> 01:04:32,174
Scott: Right.

1224
01:04:32,435 --> 01:04:34,402
Scott: So, um, you want those updates.

1225
01:04:34,422 --> 01:04:34,603
Scott: They're.

1226
01:04:34,663 --> 01:04:36,049
Scott: all they're doing is making shit better.

1227
01:04:37,074 --> 01:04:51,204
Rym: Now it's funny when I think back, like I used to toy with Linux and run servers and stuff more often, I tended to curate updates a little more, but I think that was just my younger brain, like trying to have more control, even though it didn't really matter.

1228
01:04:51,224 --> 01:04:56,383
Rym: And I tended to separately because I was a nerd trying to do stuff that wasn't super stable.

1229
01:04:56,423 --> 01:05:01,683
Rym: I usually often needed to jump into less stable versions of updates to make things work.

1230
01:05:02,687 --> 01:05:02,988
Scott: Well, yeah.

1231
01:05:03,008 --> 01:05:05,116
Scott: I mean, that's just a Linux world thing, right?

1232
01:05:05,156 --> 01:05:11,280
Scott: Is that, you know, you have lots and lots of small packages that all interact and have dependencies on each other.

1233
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:14,010
Scott: That doesn't exist with monolithic software packages.

1234
01:05:14,070 --> 01:05:14,251
Scott: Right.

1235
01:05:15,054 --> 01:05:19,792
Scott: And so, especially if you're, you know, messing with your computer as a hobby, right?

1236
01:05:19,812 --> 01:05:22,764
Scott: Like using a gen two or an arch Linux or something like that.

1237
01:05:22,844 --> 01:05:23,106
Scott: Right.

1238
01:05:23,447 --> 01:05:24,392
Scott: It's like, yeah.

1239
01:05:24,472 --> 01:05:27,025
Scott: It's like, you want to, you know, here's a program I actually want to use.

1240
01:05:27,045 --> 01:05:30,263
Scott: Here's all its dependencies is another program I want to use and all its dependencies.

1241
01:05:30,544 --> 01:05:34,241
Scott: And there's a lot of overlaps and mismatches and, you know, there are ways to manage those.

1242
01:05:34,261 --> 01:05:36,794
Scott: But yeah, it can cause, it can cause some issues.

1243
01:05:36,854 --> 01:05:46,975
Scott: It's like, you know, if you want to change the default Python on your computer from two to three, and now this other thing that only works with Python two is looking for the default Python, you got to go fix it.

1244
01:05:47,356 --> 01:06:00,372
Scott: You know, you can run into problems there if you're just always updating everything, which is a good reason to, if you actually want to use your computer and not play with your computer, that you should use a distribution like say Ubuntu or Debian or something more stable.

1245
01:06:00,452 --> 01:06:10,045
Rym: Use one that's stable and has like semi-monolithic or at least like automatic updates that are just binary distributions, not source distributions.

1246
01:06:10,426 --> 01:06:11,971
Scott: And just run the auto update.

1247
01:06:12,132 --> 01:06:16,067
Scott: And unless you do weird stuff, it's going to take care of everything for you.

1248
01:06:16,168 --> 01:06:16,409
Scott: Right.

1249
01:06:16,911 --> 01:06:18,660
Rym: Now, listener pointed out, I was going to get to this.

1250
01:06:19,001 --> 01:06:20,788
Rym: There is even more complications here.

1251
01:06:21,230 --> 01:06:30,160
Rym: We live in New York with fiber and like everything, but there are people who have devices that can't get online often or that have metered bandwidth.

1252
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:31,041
Scott: Yep.

1253
01:06:31,582 --> 01:06:33,346
Rym: Or unreliable internet.

1254
01:06:33,647 --> 01:06:39,642
Rym: And sometimes you can't update or you like have to go through a rigmarole.

1255
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:45,826
Rym: Like I remember I knew someone when I worked at IBM, they'd like had basically an ISDN line at their house.

1256
01:06:45,866 --> 01:06:47,132
Rym: So they couldn't actually update.

1257
01:06:47,152 --> 01:06:48,439
Scott: That used to be the shit though.

1258
01:06:48,479 --> 01:06:48,620
Scott: Right.

1259
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:49,383
Scott: It used to be awesome.

1260
01:06:49,424 --> 01:06:49,564
Scott: Right.

1261
01:06:49,605 --> 01:06:49,806
Rym: Yeah.

1262
01:06:50,288 --> 01:06:54,127
Rym: I think that old website is down where the guy's using AOL and the tech guy's like, what the fuck's wrong with you?

1263
01:06:54,167 --> 01:06:55,171
Rym: We have like a corporate OC3.

1264
01:06:55,212 --> 01:06:58,585
Rym: It costs like $10,000 a month.

1265
01:06:58,706 --> 01:07:01,095
Scott: When I'm at home, iOS apps have a lot of updates.

1266
01:07:01,175 --> 01:07:01,376
Scott: Right.

1267
01:07:01,717 --> 01:07:06,099
Scott: Especially some of the more popular ones, you'll get updates maybe like once a week even for some of those things.

1268
01:07:06,159 --> 01:07:06,300
Scott: Right.

1269
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:14,515
Scott: So every once in a while, my iPhone, it'll either auto update the apps on its own or I'll go into the app store and I'll just push the button that says update all the apps.

1270
01:07:14,555 --> 01:07:14,736
Scott: Right.

1271
01:07:14,997 --> 01:07:18,474
Scott: And sometimes there'll be like 10 plus updates in there, like on a regular basis.

1272
01:07:18,514 --> 01:07:18,715
Scott: Yeah.

1273
01:07:18,856 --> 01:07:21,326
Rym: I tell my phone I can only update when I'm on wifi.

1274
01:07:21,808 --> 01:07:22,008
Scott: Yeah.

1275
01:07:22,289 --> 01:07:25,441
Scott: If I go on a trip, like say to a Pax, if I could do such a thing.

1276
01:07:25,782 --> 01:07:26,002
Scott: Right.

1277
01:07:26,665 --> 01:07:37,917
Scott: I don't, you know, the internet that I have when I'm not at home is airplane, internet, air, uh, hotel, internet, maybe an internet limit on my phone.

1278
01:07:37,937 --> 01:07:39,322
Scott: I am not updating the apps.

1279
01:07:39,423 --> 01:07:40,890
Scott: I know my, yeah, my data on my phone.

1280
01:07:40,930 --> 01:07:43,181
Scott: I'm not using any of those to download all the updates.

1281
01:07:43,241 --> 01:07:46,613
Scott: When I get home, it's like 40 apps need updating.

1282
01:07:46,653 --> 01:07:48,962
Scott: It's like, all right, let's do it all now.

1283
01:07:49,945 --> 01:07:50,226
Scott: Yeah.

1284
01:07:50,507 --> 01:07:56,375
Scott: Which is also kind of a good thing because like, it's similar to the example you said where you're editing the thing for a week and you don't do updates.

1285
01:07:56,395 --> 01:07:57,783
Scott: Then it's like, I'm on a trip.

1286
01:07:57,863 --> 01:08:00,558
Scott: I can't afford to have anything break on my phone while I'm on the trip.

1287
01:08:00,618 --> 01:08:01,764
Scott: I need all this stuff to be working.

1288
01:08:01,785 --> 01:08:04,016
Scott: And then when I get home, I can do all the updates.

1289
01:08:04,277 --> 01:08:14,657
Rym: In fact, I was on a trip where the, uh, I think the jet blue app stopped working on my phone because the new updated version doesn't work with a whole ton of Android phones for some reason.

1290
01:08:14,958 --> 01:08:15,842
Rym: And they didn't fix it.

1291
01:08:15,903 --> 01:08:17,350
Rym: And I don't fly jet blue anymore.

1292
01:08:17,390 --> 01:08:17,913
Rym: It doesn't matter.

1293
01:08:17,934 --> 01:08:18,899
Rym: That was before COVID.

1294
01:08:19,241 --> 01:08:24,316
Rym: But literally I flew somewhere with like the electronic, uh, like, uh, ticket.

1295
01:08:24,858 --> 01:08:30,923
Rym: And then when I've tried to go fly home, the app wouldn't work on my phone anymore because it updated on the hotel wifi.

1296
01:08:31,685 --> 01:08:31,827
Rym: Yep.

1297
01:08:32,488 --> 01:08:32,689
Scott: All right.

1298
01:08:32,710 --> 01:08:35,944
Scott: So let's, you know, there's a lot more to say on this, but let's go to the other side, right?

1299
01:08:35,964 --> 01:08:39,661
Scott: So you're a software developer or a software publisher of some kind, right?

1300
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:49,636
Scott: You have, you have clients, users, be it inside a company, I guess we'll have to talk about a company or, you know, enterprise versus, uh, enterprise is its own world.

1301
01:08:49,718 --> 01:08:54,495
Rym: Like that's, uh, and also there's less and less deployed enterprise software.

1302
01:08:54,515 --> 01:08:58,267
Rym: Increasingly a lot of enterprise stuff moves to a software as a service or SAS model.

1303
01:08:58,627 --> 01:09:04,529
Rym: You hear people where there's a website that you go to and the website is the program.

1304
01:09:04,850 --> 01:09:05,313
Rym: So, right.

1305
01:09:05,332 --> 01:09:06,417
Scott: So there's nothing to talk about.

1306
01:09:06,438 --> 01:09:11,524
Scott: The reason we didn't mention those things, you know, updating Twitter is because as a user, you have no choice, right?

1307
01:09:11,685 --> 01:09:12,772
Scott: There's no decision to make.

1308
01:09:12,812 --> 01:09:14,140
Scott: It's like, you're stuck with what they give you.

1309
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:16,711
Scott: On the user side, if you have a cloud app, right?

1310
01:09:16,751 --> 01:09:19,484
Scott: It's like, if Google updates Google docs, it's like, guess what?

1311
01:09:19,524 --> 01:09:20,671
Scott: You're using the newest Google docs.

1312
01:09:20,712 --> 01:09:21,113
Scott: Tough shit.

1313
01:09:21,215 --> 01:09:23,526
Rym: Maybe if you're lucky, they'll be like, here's the new version.

1314
01:09:23,827 --> 01:09:24,328
Rym: Try it out.

1315
01:09:24,368 --> 01:09:25,112
Rym: Give us feedback.

1316
01:09:25,353 --> 01:09:28,166
Scott: Reddit lets you use old Reddit if you want.

1317
01:09:28,206 --> 01:09:28,466
Scott: Right.

1318
01:09:28,508 --> 01:09:29,111
Scott: For example.

1319
01:09:29,212 --> 01:09:30,599
Rym: But there's usually a time limit on that.

1320
01:09:30,618 --> 01:09:34,049
Rym: Like eventually the old YouTube studio gets shut down.

1321
01:09:35,051 --> 01:09:35,513
Rym: They did.

1322
01:09:35,533 --> 01:09:40,374
Rym: I actually, every time the new one came up, I said, no, I'm not going to use it because it's missing this one feature.

1323
01:09:40,917 --> 01:09:42,987
Rym: And eventually they added that feature and then I used it.

1324
01:09:43,188 --> 01:09:43,932
Rym: and now the old one's gone.

1325
01:09:45,078 --> 01:09:47,206
Rym: The feature was upload more than one video at the same time.

1326
01:09:48,872 --> 01:09:53,246
Scott: So that's why we're not talking about that from the user side, but from the developer side.

1327
01:09:53,286 --> 01:09:53,546
Scott: Okay.

1328
01:09:53,567 --> 01:09:56,715
Scott: So when do you update, right?

1329
01:09:57,036 --> 01:09:58,139
Scott: Your software.

1330
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:03,195
Scott: So, you know, you're probably putting bug fixes out on a daily basis, right?

1331
01:10:03,275 --> 01:10:08,250
Scott: So if you have a, like a SaaS situation, right?

1332
01:10:08,350 --> 01:10:12,122
Scott: It's like, maybe you've got a really good development workflow with the testing.

1333
01:10:12,143 --> 01:10:15,480
Scott: We've talked about, I think the nights episode and like CI/CD before, right?

1334
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:17,230
Rym: We did that relatively recently, I want to say.

1335
01:10:17,371 --> 01:10:17,532
Scott: Right.

1336
01:10:17,572 --> 01:10:18,719
Scott: So that you can go listen to that.

1337
01:10:18,759 --> 01:10:25,628
Scott: That is the good way to do things in a, in a software service model where things are just constantly being deployed all the time.

1338
01:10:25,788 --> 01:10:29,683
Scott: Users don't even realize it, but bugs are just getting fixed constantly.

1339
01:10:29,703 --> 01:10:34,484
Rym: You can even do fancy stuff like deploy an update to some of your users and then scale it up later.

1340
01:10:34,524 --> 01:10:35,749
Rym: There's all sorts like that.

1341
01:10:36,131 --> 01:10:38,199
Rym: That is a different world of updates.

1342
01:10:39,942 --> 01:10:40,102
Scott: Yep.

1343
01:10:40,303 --> 01:10:41,388
Rym: And it's kind of an exciting world.

1344
01:10:41,428 --> 01:10:44,060
Rym: Like I like that more agile, lowercase a agile.

1345
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:45,582
Rym: I like that.

1346
01:10:46,004 --> 01:10:49,455
Rym: I like that more agile, like idea of software.

1347
01:10:49,475 --> 01:10:50,719
Rym: Like software is a little fluid.

1348
01:10:50,799 --> 01:10:54,289
Rym: Like I feel like there are fewer people though.

1349
01:10:54,329 --> 01:10:59,286
Rym: There are still people who will see like the UI change slightly and they freak out.

1350
01:11:00,350 --> 01:11:06,280
Rym: There still are people like that, but there are fewer of them because that is sort of the default model for most things people use nowadays.

1351
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:06,621
Scott: Yeah.

1352
01:11:06,641 --> 01:11:09,658
Scott: That's also, again, a separate topic I think we've granted about before.

1353
01:11:09,719 --> 01:11:09,900
Scott: Right.

1354
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:11,765
Scott: But let's say you're not that.

1355
01:11:11,826 --> 01:11:16,146
Scott: Let's say you're making a product that's still delivered to users, you know, set up that EXE.

1356
01:11:16,166 --> 01:11:19,140
Scott: They got to download it and run the update or there's an auto update.

1357
01:11:19,421 --> 01:11:24,101
Scott: You're making a web browser when, you know, people only are going to get auto updates when you push one.

1358
01:11:24,582 --> 01:11:24,823
Scott: Right.

1359
01:11:25,143 --> 01:11:26,427
Scott: When do you push one?

1360
01:11:27,028 --> 01:11:27,870
Scott: Right.

1361
01:11:28,873 --> 01:11:32,362
Scott: So like we talked about with the user side, you have these different tiers.

1362
01:11:32,463 --> 01:11:38,683
Scott: Maybe you allow users to opt in to getting, you know, untested nightly builds or more frequent builds.

1363
01:11:38,703 --> 01:11:39,646
Scott: You can test on them.

1364
01:11:39,806 --> 01:11:42,374
Rym: I'm a fan of that UAT sort of model.

1365
01:11:42,394 --> 01:11:43,518
Rym: Yeah.

1366
01:11:43,758 --> 01:11:55,242
Scott: And then if those users aren't complaining and sending in, you know, bug reports and something after a certain amount of time, then you mark those as being ready for the next go and you send them out to the rest of the users.

1367
01:11:55,543 --> 01:11:55,724
Scott: Right.

1368
01:11:57,209 --> 01:12:00,902
Scott: You know, you also have to look at, you know, the severity of what you're pushing out.

1369
01:12:00,942 --> 01:12:02,108
Scott: Like, oh, it's a security fix.

1370
01:12:02,148 --> 01:12:04,660
Scott: Better push it out right away after you've tested it.

1371
01:12:05,422 --> 01:12:05,703
Scott: Right.

1372
01:12:06,124 --> 01:12:12,270
Scott: You know, but if it's a new feature, you got, you should wait for that new feature to be like really solid before you go with it.

1373
01:12:12,310 --> 01:12:14,600
Scott: You know, it's not as important that it goes out so soon.

1374
01:12:15,021 --> 01:12:18,296
Scott: You know, you can wait to get, you know, like you'll see Photoshop.

1375
01:12:18,336 --> 01:12:21,391
Scott: They don't put out the new features in Photoshop until they're really solid.

1376
01:12:21,411 --> 01:12:21,531
Scott: Right.

1377
01:12:21,551 --> 01:12:26,532
Scott: They're not like, here's some brush thing that barely works that we just came up with yesterday.

1378
01:12:26,552 --> 01:12:27,314
Scott: Right.

1379
01:12:27,696 --> 01:12:30,165
Scott: But if it's a security fix, that shit goes out the next day.

1380
01:12:30,185 --> 01:12:30,948
Scott: Right.

1381
01:12:31,530 --> 01:12:56,572
Rym: And in terms of like auto updaters, you have to think about like, it really comes down to if your audience is big iron enterprise or like smaller shops in terms of does your updater itself have to support those enterprisey type of workflows, like let the administrators in a firm like control the deployment settings of updates via a registry setting or something like, do you make that easy?

1382
01:12:56,592 --> 01:12:57,977
Rym: Do you support it directly?

1383
01:12:57,997 --> 01:12:59,583
Rym: Do you support it directly in your app?

1384
01:12:59,864 --> 01:13:05,625
Rym: Or do you just make it a monolithic install and AXEs and MSIs and let them use generic tools?

1385
01:13:05,685 --> 01:13:09,782
Rym: Like that really just depends on who's using your software for what, where, how, why, et cetera.

1386
01:13:09,802 --> 01:13:10,885
Rym: Yep.

1387
01:13:12,149 --> 01:13:14,497
Scott: So if you're doing some enterprisey biz, right.

1388
01:13:14,778 --> 01:13:16,867
Scott: You got to realize anyone getting your software as a customer.

1389
01:13:17,108 --> 01:13:17,389
Scott: Right.

1390
01:13:17,671 --> 01:13:27,957
Scott: So now, and like, they're paying a lot of money, not, you know, like, yeah, the users of your, you know, $50 software customers too, but you have supposedly a lot of them when you have a few enterprise customers, right.

1391
01:13:28,038 --> 01:13:32,460
Scott: Even few could still be a lot, but much fewer than, you know, customers of a consumer product.

1392
01:13:33,241 --> 01:13:34,406
Scott: And they're paying more money each.

1393
01:13:35,028 --> 01:13:36,433
Scott: Now the concerns.

1394
01:13:36,835 --> 01:13:40,790
Scott: it's like, there's similar concerns, but the weight on them is very shifted.

1395
01:13:40,850 --> 01:13:41,031
Scott: Right.

1396
01:13:41,051 --> 01:13:43,018
Scott: It's like, okay, we got a new update.

1397
01:13:43,279 --> 01:13:44,485
Scott: This is a security update.

1398
01:13:44,686 --> 01:13:48,905
Scott: We need to push this out right away because if any of these systems are compromised, that's devastating.

1399
01:13:48,945 --> 01:13:49,146
Scott: Yup.

1400
01:13:49,207 --> 01:13:49,488
Scott: Right.

1401
01:13:49,789 --> 01:13:52,581
Rym: Sometimes there's SLAs that you have to worry about.

1402
01:13:52,642 --> 01:13:55,633
Rym: Like if Google makes a mistake, people want their money back.

1403
01:13:55,854 --> 01:13:56,095
Rym: Yup.

1404
01:13:56,236 --> 01:13:59,450
Rym: Clawback clauses are a thing in certain kinds of software.

1405
01:13:59,470 --> 01:14:04,330
Rym: Like, Oh, if the software has certain kinds of problems and you don't fix it within X hours, I get a refund.

1406
01:14:04,350 --> 01:14:05,233
Rym: Yup.

1407
01:14:05,293 --> 01:14:06,637
Scott: That is important.

1408
01:14:06,918 --> 01:14:10,834
Scott: You also have to think about keeping, just keeping the users happier.

1409
01:14:10,934 --> 01:14:11,155
Scott: Right.

1410
01:14:11,176 --> 01:14:14,751
Scott: Cause they're using this every day at work, eight hours a day, supposedly maybe.

1411
01:14:14,771 --> 01:14:15,032
Scott: Right.

1412
01:14:15,394 --> 01:14:18,045
Scott: You know, it's like, you got to make sure those people are happy.

1413
01:14:18,065 --> 01:14:18,767
Scott: Right.

1414
01:14:18,827 --> 01:14:20,794
Rym: To a point, there's a weird situation.

1415
01:14:21,155 --> 01:14:25,315
Scott: It's like, you can upset like Twitter makes, like we just said, Twitter makes updates to its UI.

1416
01:14:25,355 --> 01:14:28,230
Scott: that makes people upset, but they just have to deal with it.

1417
01:14:28,270 --> 01:14:30,300
Scott: And eventually they shut up about it and forget about it.

1418
01:14:30,820 --> 01:14:32,365
Scott: Enterprise people, that doesn't happen.

1419
01:14:32,606 --> 01:14:32,887
Rym: Yup.

1420
01:14:33,951 --> 01:14:35,175
Scott: You have to keep them happy.

1421
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:35,898
Scott: Right.

1422
01:14:36,078 --> 01:14:40,657
Rym: But you also get into this weird situation where the users sometimes aren't actually the people.

1423
01:14:40,677 --> 01:14:41,340
Rym: you have to keep happy.

1424
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:44,297
Rym: Sometimes they're unhappy no matter what, especially in big enterprise.

1425
01:14:44,317 --> 01:14:47,112
Scott: You keep the purchaser, whoever makes the purchasing decisions.

1426
01:14:47,213 --> 01:14:48,620
Scott: That's the customer, not the user.

1427
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:50,266
Rym: The person who signs the check.

1428
01:14:50,628 --> 01:14:54,705
Rym: Well, the person who authorizes the signing of the check, the person who actually says spend that money.

1429
01:14:54,986 --> 01:14:57,236
Rym: That's the only person you actually have to keep happy.

1430
01:14:57,618 --> 01:15:03,842
Rym: But if you piss off the wrong users with a poorly planned update, that person is going to be unhappy and now you're screwed.

1431
01:15:03,862 --> 01:15:04,002
Rym: Yup.

1432
01:15:04,645 --> 01:15:11,836
Scott: Now also when you're doing enterprise software, you got to realize that the old models of the old day, if you're not doing the SaaS thing, right.

1433
01:15:12,097 --> 01:15:13,723
Scott: Even if you are doing the SaaS thing, right.

1434
01:15:14,285 --> 01:15:14,988
Scott: They still exist.

1435
01:15:15,008 --> 01:15:18,662
Scott: So when you're making a new feature, not a fix, but a feature, right.

1436
01:15:18,762 --> 01:15:24,066
Scott: If you're doing the old model, it's like, well, do we just give all our existing users this feature for free to make them happy?

1437
01:15:24,768 --> 01:15:28,120
Scott: Or do we hold off on this feature and sell it as like an upsell?

1438
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:28,460
Scott: Right.

1439
01:15:28,501 --> 01:15:31,672
Scott: So the next time we send our vendor to go visit them, right.

1440
01:15:31,752 --> 01:15:33,158
Scott: Our salesperson, right.

1441
01:15:33,519 --> 01:15:35,728
Scott: And they consider the salesperson a vendor anyway.

1442
01:15:36,049 --> 01:15:36,310
Scott: Right.

1443
01:15:36,511 --> 01:15:38,238
Scott: You say, oh, we got this new feature.

1444
01:15:38,258 --> 01:15:42,515
Scott: You want to pay us 20 more bucks a month for it or 200 more or 2000 more, right.

1445
01:15:42,676 --> 01:15:43,780
Scott: It'll make your life easier.

1446
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:44,864
Scott: You sell them on it, right.

1447
01:15:44,924 --> 01:15:46,531
Scott: Versus just giving it to them for free.

1448
01:15:46,692 --> 01:15:46,872
Scott: Yup.

1449
01:15:47,234 --> 01:15:50,068
Scott: Also, if you got the SaaS thing going on, right.

1450
01:15:50,088 --> 01:15:53,744
Scott: Where everyone's just accessing your software from the cloud, you develop a new feature.

1451
01:15:53,784 --> 01:15:56,152
Scott: Well, is this feature for all users?

1452
01:15:56,493 --> 01:15:59,984
Scott: Is this feature for only the people who are pro level?

1453
01:16:00,004 --> 01:16:02,293
Scott: They're paying more per month per user.

1454
01:16:02,413 --> 01:16:03,537
Rym: Well, do a real analysis.

1455
01:16:03,577 --> 01:16:09,396
Rym: Is this an option for existing users or is it a feature targeting new users?

1456
01:16:09,937 --> 01:16:10,098
Scott: Right.

1457
01:16:10,178 --> 01:16:11,162
Scott: Is it a steering wheel?

1458
01:16:11,182 --> 01:16:16,147
Scott: It's like, all right, all cars got the steering wheel or is it the air conditioning that not everyone gets?

1459
01:16:16,749 --> 01:16:16,990
Scott: Yeah.

1460
01:16:17,030 --> 01:16:19,841
Scott: It's like, you know, you suddenly, you got to consider those things, right.

1461
01:16:19,902 --> 01:16:30,168
Scott: And that actually an engineer, you develop the software and they're like, yeah, we're only going to only going to get like 10 people using this because we're only going to let them use it if they paid a hundred zillion dollars.

1462
01:16:30,208 --> 01:16:30,349
Rym: Yeah.

1463
01:16:30,429 --> 01:16:37,482
Rym: Then like the update process to like get that feature can be kind of onerous because it's like a one-time like, well, they get the special version of the software.

1464
01:16:38,345 --> 01:16:38,566
Scott: Yup.

1465
01:16:38,746 --> 01:16:38,927
Scott: Yup.

1466
01:16:38,987 --> 01:16:39,950
Scott: Yup.

1467
01:16:40,451 --> 01:16:49,368
Rym: There's a lot to discuss there and it bleeds into like, look at what you said, what we were talking about now bleeds up into like the business planning and also bleeds down into like the DevOps.

1468
01:16:49,428 --> 01:16:56,709
Rym: Like it starts to cross a lot of lines in big companies on both the publisher side and the user side.

1469
01:16:56,729 --> 01:16:58,875
Rym: It gets really complex.

1470
01:16:58,915 --> 01:17:04,379
Rym: Like it's really hard to talk about this in detail, especially considering like a lot of this has been my job over the years.

1471
01:17:04,399 --> 01:17:11,082
Rym: I can't share a lot of anecdotes, but there is a third space I want to touch on briefly in this episode.

1472
01:17:11,805 --> 01:17:12,990
Scott: Firmware updates.

1473
01:17:13,030 --> 01:17:13,853
Scott: Then I got to eat food.

1474
01:17:14,014 --> 01:17:14,757
Scott: Oh, firmware.

1475
01:17:14,797 --> 01:17:14,938
Scott: Yeah.

1476
01:17:14,978 --> 01:17:15,742
Scott: Firmware is a little bit different.

1477
01:17:15,762 --> 01:17:21,568
Rym: Because firmware updates are an interesting thing because there are software updates that can effectively brick software.

1478
01:17:21,628 --> 01:17:27,567
Rym: Like there I've seen updates to software that change a database in a non-reversible way.

1479
01:17:28,249 --> 01:17:32,930
Scott: I've had sometimes updates for iOS apps where the app, you try to open it and it just immediately crashes.

1480
01:17:33,091 --> 01:17:35,484
Scott: And that's like, well, I shouldn't have updated that one, right?

1481
01:17:35,504 --> 01:17:36,991
Scott: It's all it does is immediately crash.

1482
01:17:37,052 --> 01:17:39,404
Scott: Now I restart my phone, I delete and reinstall the app.

1483
01:17:39,705 --> 01:17:41,615
Scott: It's like, nope, it's just, it's just crashing.

1484
01:17:41,635 --> 01:17:42,298
Scott: They need to fix it.

1485
01:17:42,318 --> 01:17:45,391
Scott: And usually they do fix it, but it's like, well, that software is bricked.

1486
01:17:45,491 --> 01:17:48,202
Scott: It just won't even launch until whenever.

1487
01:17:48,262 --> 01:17:48,583
Rym: Yup.

1488
01:17:48,724 --> 01:17:50,812
Rym: Now occasionally there have been situations.

1489
01:17:51,134 --> 01:17:59,097
Rym: I had some software like consumer software a while ago where the auto updater itself broke with an update.

1490
01:17:59,418 --> 01:18:03,274
Rym: And the only way to fix that was to update the auto up with an auto update.

1491
01:18:03,334 --> 01:18:04,479
Rym: There's no auto update for that.

1492
01:18:04,499 --> 01:18:07,594
Rym: You had to go get an exe to fix the auto updater to then get the rest of the updates.

1493
01:18:07,895 --> 01:18:14,384
Rym: But the trouble they had was telling their users to go do this, convincing them that it wasn't a lie or a scam or malware.

1494
01:18:14,404 --> 01:18:17,395
Rym: It was, that was, I've seen that happen a few times.

1495
01:18:17,456 --> 01:18:20,124
Rym: My advice to you as a publisher, you're going to have auto updaters.

1496
01:18:21,006 --> 01:18:23,613
Rym: It had better be able to recover itself.

1497
01:18:24,776 --> 01:18:26,702
Rym: Like focus on that first.

1498
01:18:27,023 --> 01:18:33,930
Rym: If an update fails, it had better work its way back to where it was before the update tried to apply without any weird problems.

1499
01:18:33,950 --> 01:18:41,622
Scott: I like the software architecture of if you have an auto updater or updater in your self updating software, that you also have a backup updater in your software.

1500
01:18:41,923 --> 01:18:44,652
Scott: that is like, you can invoke that one if the other one fails.

1501
01:18:44,713 --> 01:18:45,997
Scott: Yeah.

1502
01:18:46,017 --> 01:18:47,784
Scott: To sort of reinstall the whole schmageggy.

1503
01:18:48,045 --> 01:18:56,276
Scott: But also publisher, you got to worry about security because your updater, what if the updater is often the, it has where the security holes are.

1504
01:18:56,296 --> 01:18:56,778
Scott: Yep.

1505
01:18:56,998 --> 01:18:57,480
Rym: Attack someone.

1506
01:18:57,640 --> 01:18:59,770
Rym: The updater has a way like a fallback mechanism.

1507
01:18:59,790 --> 01:19:04,569
Rym: Someone figures out the way to get that to turn on and they start like publishing their own updates.

1508
01:19:04,790 --> 01:19:15,465
Rym: They point the auto updater is often the security hole that all the stuff better be signed or point the auto updater to different IP and magic comes down the pipe and stuff.

1509
01:19:15,485 --> 01:19:15,565
Scott: Yeah.

1510
01:19:15,585 --> 01:19:21,934
Scott: Make sure you're not installing updates from some not official source for anything ever, because that's basically how you get ruined.

1511
01:19:21,954 --> 01:19:22,818
Scott: But no matter what.

1512
01:19:22,918 --> 01:19:29,745
Rym: Firmware updates are the one place where I still do not recommend people just blindly install the newest version of firmware on all their stuff.

1513
01:19:30,066 --> 01:19:35,344
Rym: Cause firmware updates don't like they can break your device permanently.

1514
01:19:35,364 --> 01:19:36,529
Rym: They're fiddly.

1515
01:19:36,569 --> 01:19:38,036
Rym: They're often difficult to install.

1516
01:19:38,056 --> 01:19:41,852
Rym: That's getting easier over time, but like, eh, depends on what you're updating.

1517
01:19:41,892 --> 01:19:45,729
Rym: My phone's firmware pretty easy to update my hard drives.

1518
01:19:45,810 --> 01:19:47,055
Rym: Like I'm never going to bother with that.

1519
01:19:47,075 --> 01:19:48,321
Scott: Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, but yeah.

1520
01:19:48,643 --> 01:19:51,940
Scott: So firmware isn't, people think firmware is kind of magical and mysterious.

1521
01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:58,288
Scott: Uh, I could find you, there's some resources online that sort of demystify firmware, but basically firmware is just software.

1522
01:19:58,328 --> 01:19:59,132
Scott: It's not special.

1523
01:19:59,414 --> 01:20:03,249
Scott: The only difference is that instead of being written to your hard drive, right.

1524
01:20:03,470 --> 01:20:06,662
Scott: Where it's sort of, you know, uh, it feels like it's malleable.

1525
01:20:06,963 --> 01:20:12,264
Scott: It's written to like some flash storage inside of a device where you wouldn't think of there being storage, right?

1526
01:20:12,746 --> 01:20:15,255
Scott: So it's not really a big deal to update firmware.

1527
01:20:15,597 --> 01:20:19,628
Scott: The problem is, is that if firmware is bad, right?

1528
01:20:19,989 --> 01:20:26,287
Scott: The it's sort of part of hardware and it's hard from a user interface way to interface with it.

1529
01:20:26,889 --> 01:20:33,293
Scott: Um, so if a hardware has bad firmware, that hardware appears completely broken, even though it may be fixable.

1530
01:20:33,353 --> 01:20:36,588
Rym: Like if I apply a firmware update to my printer, it might just not power on anymore.

1531
01:20:36,628 --> 01:20:36,990
Rym: Now what?

1532
01:20:37,251 --> 01:20:37,612
Rym: Good luck.

1533
01:20:37,733 --> 01:20:42,716
Scott: Yeah, you're gonna, uh, yeah, you'll, there is a way probably to fix it, but it's not going to be obvious.

1534
01:20:42,856 --> 01:20:45,806
Scott: It'll be annoying, tedious, difficult, right?

1535
01:20:45,826 --> 01:20:53,553
Scott: You'd like get the printer to launch into debug mode and do a thing and maybe put a file on a USB stick attached to the printer.

1536
01:20:53,573 --> 01:20:59,132
Rym: Set up a TFT, a lot of, a lot of firmware updates involve running a TFTP server on your local network.

1537
01:21:00,136 --> 01:21:01,501
Scott: Uh, I don't, haven't seen that one.

1538
01:21:01,561 --> 01:21:03,890
Scott: I've seen that one in the past, but not recently.

1539
01:21:04,231 --> 01:21:06,861
Scott: I saw that one a lot, a lot in the past.

1540
01:21:07,002 --> 01:21:09,289
Scott: I've seen that one a lot in the past, but not recently.

1541
01:21:10,152 --> 01:21:16,778
Scott: Um, but yeah, so when you're going to install firmware updates, it's like, oftentimes there can be good firmware updates.

1542
01:21:16,798 --> 01:21:20,994
Scott: For example, I update the firmware in my camera pretty regularly.

1543
01:21:21,014 --> 01:21:29,249
Scott: I check the change log first, but all you do is put a file on an SD card, put it in the camera, turn the camera on, wait, don't touch anything.

1544
01:21:29,550 --> 01:21:30,334
Scott: Wait for it to finish.

1545
01:21:30,394 --> 01:21:31,620
Scott: I've never had a problem doing it.

1546
01:21:31,740 --> 01:21:45,993
Scott: It's always worked, but I checked the change log and most of the time it's like, yeah, this lens will auto-focus better or, and it's a lens I have, or we added the, a feature so you can use your camera as more of a webcam kind of, right?

1547
01:21:46,074 --> 01:21:48,181
Scott: It's like there's meaningful updates in those.

1548
01:21:48,221 --> 01:21:50,733
Scott: They don't push those out for just any old thing, right?

1549
01:21:50,833 --> 01:21:53,705
Scott: It's like they push them out when something's significant in there.

1550
01:21:54,187 --> 01:22:00,517
Scott: Um, you know, sometimes they'll have to add extra pages to the user manual for the camera cause they've added new features to the firmware.

1551
01:22:00,879 --> 01:22:01,742
Scott: So it's like, those are good.

1552
01:22:02,184 --> 01:22:04,492
Scott: Um, but like, yeah, update your bios.

1553
01:22:04,834 --> 01:22:06,520
Scott: It's like, well, what did they change?

1554
01:22:06,660 --> 01:22:08,208
Scott: It's like my bios is working right now.

1555
01:22:08,630 --> 01:22:11,363
Scott: My EFI, my computer's turning on and functioning, right?

1556
01:22:11,785 --> 01:22:13,231
Scott: What did they add, right?

1557
01:22:13,251 --> 01:22:16,664
Scott: That I'm going to risk breaking my motherboard, right?

1558
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:18,189
Scott: If it's not something good, I'm not doing it.

1559
01:22:18,490 --> 01:22:20,698
Scott: You know, why would I do it?

1560
01:22:20,718 --> 01:22:21,220
Scott: What's the point?

1561
01:22:21,541 --> 01:22:29,692
Scott: if there's no point why it's not, you know, you're not risking as much updating Chrome as you are updating your EFI bios firmware.

1562
01:22:29,833 --> 01:22:37,626
Rym: And over time, some firmware is sort of auto updating just like software would, and some firmware is just going to be fiddly forever or for the foreseeable future.

1563
01:22:38,148 --> 01:22:43,576
Rym: And just honestly, don't worry about it unless you have a specie or told to worry about it and have a specific reason to worry about it.

1564
01:22:43,596 --> 01:22:45,506
Scott: Well, I think it's like, I think you actually should worry about it.

1565
01:22:45,526 --> 01:22:53,495
Scott: You should go, you know, know all the hardware you have and seek out if there are firmware updates for the hardware you have.

1566
01:22:53,836 --> 01:22:58,353
Rym: Oh yeah, but not like super like I probably, I do that like once a year ish.

1567
01:22:58,594 --> 01:23:02,010
Scott: Yeah, no, you don't do it all the time, but just saying those things are not pushed out to you.

1568
01:23:02,050 --> 01:23:04,844
Scott: They don't like raise alarms and like say, hey, update.

1569
01:23:04,864 --> 01:23:06,433
Scott: Then no one's notifying you of that, right?

1570
01:23:06,453 --> 01:23:07,439
Scott: You have to go out and find it.

1571
01:23:08,581 --> 01:23:11,048
Scott: But go out and find it, see what it does.

1572
01:23:11,068 --> 01:23:15,040
Scott: If it does something meaningful, go ahead and do it.

1573
01:23:15,341 --> 01:23:17,472
Scott: If it doesn't, don't just let it go.

1574
01:23:17,492 --> 01:23:18,718
Scott: It's like, you didn't even know about it.

1575
01:23:18,738 --> 01:23:20,244
Scott: If you hadn't searched anyway, right?

1576
01:23:21,168 --> 01:23:24,120
Scott: There are some systems though that are auto updating firmware.

1577
01:23:24,140 --> 01:23:27,171
Scott: For example, my work laptop is this Dell latitude, whatever.

1578
01:23:27,191 --> 01:23:32,677
Scott: And it's actually surprisingly came with a perfectly clean install of windows, which I was like, oh, that's very nice.

1579
01:23:32,717 --> 01:23:39,964
Scott: There's no Dell garbage on here, but there was actually one piece of Dell garbage, which is this app called Dell command update.

1580
01:23:40,807 --> 01:23:49,735
Scott: Dell command update, uh, gets driver updates for the laptop hardware and also firmware updates for stuff in the laptop automatically.

1581
01:23:49,836 --> 01:23:50,760
Rym: Actually, that's a good point.

1582
01:23:51,020 --> 01:23:56,219
Rym: Laptops in particular often have a bunch of firmware and some app like that.

1583
01:23:56,259 --> 01:23:58,587
Rym: You should probably let that auto update or run.

1584
01:23:58,607 --> 01:24:05,914
Scott: when I, when they first, right, when they first gave me this laptop, it was slow as balls and all kinds of broken and kind of meh.

1585
01:24:06,336 --> 01:24:11,172
Scott: And after I ran Dell command update, it actually was now that became operating normally.

1586
01:24:11,272 --> 01:24:16,452
Scott: So, uh, it did make a huge positive difference to actually run that separate updater.

1587
01:24:16,472 --> 01:24:18,963
Scott: It's not, it's not a replacement for windows update.

1588
01:24:19,043 --> 01:24:22,721
Scott: It only updates like laptop specific things that windows update doesn't know about.

1589
01:24:23,323 --> 01:24:32,881
Scott: Um, but that's an example of like, sometimes the laptop will reboot after the Dell command update and like, it'll say like updating firmware, do not power off laptop, beep, beep, beep, beep, right.

1590
01:24:33,604 --> 01:24:34,085
Scott: Um, yep.

1591
01:24:34,366 --> 01:24:35,851
Scott: So that's what does annoy me though.

1592
01:24:36,153 --> 01:24:45,284
Rym: Firmware updates oftentimes still have the problem of it says don't update, like don't power off during eh, and it will just break if you power off during eh.

1593
01:24:45,907 --> 01:24:48,979
Scott: Well, yeah, there's no, that's just a matter of how computers work.

1594
01:24:48,999 --> 01:24:50,386
Scott: There's nothing you can really do about that, right?

1595
01:24:50,406 --> 01:24:53,963
Scott: It's like, it's like, it's flashing data into a piece of flash memory.

1596
01:24:53,983 --> 01:24:59,443
Scott: that will not, that flash memory will not be able to be written to or read from if there's no power.

1597
01:24:59,744 --> 01:25:04,122
Scott: If you cut the power now, it won't finish writing the software to the flash memory.

1598
01:25:04,403 --> 01:25:07,117
Scott: And when you try to turn it back on now, that device won't operate.

1599
01:25:07,157 --> 01:25:08,805
Scott: There's nothing you can do about that.

1600
01:25:08,926 --> 01:25:11,680
Rym: And there are technological solutions to that, but they're not feasible.

1601
01:25:11,980 --> 01:25:13,286
Rym: Like having backup flash memory.

1602
01:25:13,306 --> 01:25:17,626
Scott: Put twice as much, put twice as much flash memory in the device, making it more expensive.

1603
01:25:17,646 --> 01:25:20,460
Rym: That's not going to happen for like your low end monitor or whatever.

1604
01:25:21,380 --> 01:25:21,581
Scott: Right.

1605
01:25:21,701 --> 01:25:21,922
Scott: Yeah.

1606
01:25:21,983 --> 01:25:23,991
Scott: So, um, that's the thing.

1607
01:25:24,052 --> 01:25:24,333
Scott: All right.

1608
01:25:24,373 --> 01:25:25,658
Scott: So we've gone long enough and I'm hungry.

1609
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:26,925
Rym: So good times.

1610
01:25:26,965 --> 01:25:28,072
Rym: See you guys Wednesday.

1611
01:25:28,092 --> 01:25:28,413
Scott: Update.

1612
01:25:29,017 --> 01:25:29,540
Scott: Update your shit.

1613
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:34,310
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1614
01:25:34,371 --> 01:25:39,514
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1615
01:25:39,735 --> 01:25:44,794
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1616
01:25:45,015 --> 01:25:47,686
Rym: Remember GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1617
01:25:47,826 --> 01:25:52,467
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1618
01:25:52,789 --> 01:25:56,785
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1619
01:25:57,207 --> 01:26:03,380
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience, but unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1620
01:26:04,381 --> 01:26:13,553
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this Monday episode of GeekNights are Alan Joyce, Heidi McNichols, Marty Green, just like a dude guy, Chartavish, and Graham Finch.

1621
01:26:13,854 --> 01:26:15,420
Rym: You hold the key to my heart.

1622
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:31,460
Rym: Well, the plane landed and when I came out, Clinton Walton, Jay Vance, Ren from New Zealand, Ryan Perrin, Nicholas Brando, Chris Midkiff, Dread Lily Tenebrae, Chris Rymer, Finn, Shervin Von Harl, and a whole bunch of people who do not want me to say their names.

1623
01:26:32,660 --> 01:26:44,525
Rym: So funny story, Scott's preamp might have literally blown up about a minute after we cut off the stream, so we might have to tweak some audio pipelines for the Wednesday episode, so stay tuned on that.

1624
01:26:44,906 --> 01:27:01,786
Rym: That'll be a fun thing to fix, especially because we also have to, luckily, we use a different set of equipment when we record the panels, so our MagWest panel that I mentioned will not be affected by this, but we might have to hack something together to record GeekNights on Wednesday, so see how that goes.

1625
01:27:02,107 --> 01:27:09,436
Rym: But anyway, for now, I leave you with something that I don't know if anyone will actually remember but me.
