1
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,218
Rym: -It's Monday, November 9th, 2020.

2
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:10,439
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:10,459 --> 00:00:11,241
Rym: -I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,373
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:23,830
Rym: Tonight, there is a new president of the United States, but more importantly, we are talking about the Hypertext Transfer Protocol.

6
00:00:25,632 --> 00:00:26,647
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:33,810
Rym: So, uh, we knew that Joe Biden had become the president, like, the week, like, before the weekend.

8
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:38,230
Rym: Like, we already knew, but no one had called it officially, except decision-based.

9
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:44,547
Scott: It's one of those situations I always talk about, where Rym brings the news on the show, and I'm like, "We knew this news already.

10
00:00:44,608 --> 00:00:45,169
Scott: This isn't

11
00:00:45,209 --> 00:00:45,490
Scott: news.".

12
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,888
Scott: And Rym's like, "No, but now that it's officially confirmed, it's a different

13
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:49,190
Scott: news.".

14
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:51,060
Scott: And I'm like, "I knew that last year.

15
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,387
Scott: That was just, I knew that my whole

16
00:00:52,428 --> 00:00:52,609
Scott: life.".

17
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,390
Rym: Well, I mean, in this case, if we didn't have an electoral college, we knew, like, the night of the election.

18
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,343
Rym: 'Cause the popular vote is, like, it's a landslide in the popular vote.

19
00:01:00,424 --> 00:01:01,688
Rym: Like, they're still counting.

20
00:01:01,748 --> 00:01:02,190
Rym: It's crazy.

21
00:01:02,511 --> 00:01:03,736
Scott: Millions more people.

22
00:01:03,796 --> 00:01:07,730
Scott: If we had to, if the good people and the bad people had to fight each other... We win.

23
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:11,747
Scott: ...and the non-voters and ineligible voters just didn't participate...

24
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,409
Rym: Biden won by, like, four... ...we would destroy them.

25
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:16,490
Rym: ...four million already, and it's projected to hit, like...

26
00:01:16,611 --> 00:01:17,909
Scott: At least four million people.

27
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:18,969
Scott: And it's gonna be, like, seven million.

28
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,499
Scott: It doesn't matter how big your army is at the beginning.

29
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,470
Scott: If you're outnumbered by four million, you're in deep shit, right?

30
00:01:25,813 --> 00:01:33,490
Scott: I mean, even a billion, an army of a billion versus an army of a billion plus four million is in deep, deep shit, right?

31
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:36,599
Scott: Because the billion versus the billion fight, right?

32
00:01:36,699 --> 00:01:40,410
Scott: But four million of those billion are being double-teamed.

33
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:43,268
Scott: So they've only got, assuming everyone's equal strength...

34
00:01:43,591 --> 00:01:46,310
Rym: Or, or, actually, that's not, that, you know, what you're talking, you know how you're talking?

35
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:58,905
Rym: You're talking how people would lose wars in ancient times, and even medieval times, and even all the way up to World War I. Because the real use of that extra four to seven million is not to double-team.

36
00:01:58,965 --> 00:02:00,088
Rym: No, no, no, that's not how you do it.

37
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:00,878
Rym: No.

38
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,248
Rym: Those are the reserves.

39
00:02:03,634 --> 00:02:04,125
Scott: Oh, okay, so...

40
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:10,070
Rym: The attrition battle comes down, both sides are almost depleted, and then cavalry and Gandalf the White come over the horizon.

41
00:02:11,754 --> 00:02:13,170
Scott: Well, that's how we did, and it worked.

42
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:13,731
Rym: Yup.

43
00:02:14,112 --> 00:02:18,849
Rym: But, uh, the official official was delayed for, basically, bullshit reasons, but it was delayed.

44
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:26,690
Scott: The official official official will be when the House certifies the slates of electors, which is, like, next month, or when that is weeks away.

45
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,940
Rym: There's actually a bunch of different steps, uh...

46
00:02:29,591 --> 00:02:30,969
Scott: That's the final step, though.

47
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,826
Rym: Well, yeah, the final final final step is Inauguration Day.

48
00:02:34,846 --> 00:02:35,490
Rym: It is possible...

49
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,720
Scott: That step is, that's just simply ceremonial.

50
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,990
Scott: The only one that matters is the certification.

51
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:46,970
Rym: So, a point of order, it is possible if the Electoral College can't, like, get its shit together on Inauguration Day.

52
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:50,610
Rym: What do you think happens if the Electoral College just doesn't vote, and Inauguration Day comes?

53
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,449
Rym: I'm just curious, trivia bit, then we'll get into the show.

54
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,624
Scott: I mean, I know a lot of the scenarios, but I don't know that scenario.

55
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:10,309
Rym: That scenario is actually really complicated, and there's debate about it, but the best guess is that there is, the current president is no longer the president, and you just follow the 25th Amendment.

56
00:03:11,311 --> 00:03:15,000
Rym: So, you say, "Well, president's not the president anymore, nor is the vice president.

57
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:18,409
Rym: The next one in line is the Speaker of the House, who is still the Speaker of the

58
00:03:18,429 --> 00:03:18,669
Rym: House.".

59
00:03:18,971 --> 00:03:20,550
Rym: They immediately become the acting president.

60
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:22,248
Scott: I don't know.

61
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:22,350
Rym: Okay.

62
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,110
Rym: I'd be fine with that, President Pelosi.

63
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:30,010
Rym: But, something happened to me that had nothing to do with the election.

64
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:39,090
Rym: Because on the day with the official announcement, Emily and I were hiking in the wilderness, we were in a valley, no cell signal, just enjoying the world, not thinking about politics.

65
00:03:39,494 --> 00:03:41,090
Rym: Just birds were singing, it was beautiful.

66
00:03:41,951 --> 00:03:42,669
Scott: Yeah, birds don't know.

67
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:46,642
Rym: We crested a ridge, and suddenly, my phone starts buzzing.

68
00:03:47,003 --> 00:03:48,990
Rym: Emily's looking at her watch, because her watch is buzzing.

69
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:59,150
Rym: We must have gotten like one bare bar of data, cresting this ridge, and the first thing I see is a text message, I don't even have data yet, from our friend Scott Johnson.

70
00:04:00,834 --> 00:04:03,788
Scott: Text messages are going to get through much more readily than anything.

71
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:07,669
Rym: I think we've talked about on GeekNights why the text will always get through, or won't.

72
00:04:07,972 --> 00:04:09,008
Scott: No, actually it won't.

73
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:11,536
Rym: It won't, but it'll get somewhere.

74
00:04:11,697 --> 00:04:16,010
Rym: It might just be in a rotating buffer in a cell tower for years, never going anywhere.

75
00:04:17,394 --> 00:04:17,545
Scott: Anyway.

76
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:22,464
Rym: And I get this text, and he's like, "Pretty sure you're in the middle of nowhere.

77
00:04:22,484 --> 00:04:22,524
Rym: We

78
00:04:22,785 --> 00:04:23,227
Rym: won.".

79
00:04:24,773 --> 00:04:27,530
Rym: I wanted to be the first one to tell you, and he was.

80
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:38,590
Rym: So the next day, I go out to run, and I'm on Randall's Island, just doing my half marathon like I do every weekend, and this dude tried to have a fistfight with me.

81
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,250
Rym: Nothing to do with the election.

82
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:41,134
Scott: You're running.

83
00:04:41,195 --> 00:04:43,285
Scott: How long are you near a person if you're running?

84
00:04:43,305 --> 00:04:44,190
Scott: Were they also running?

85
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:44,791
Scott: Right?

86
00:04:44,891 --> 00:04:45,514
Rym: So get this.

87
00:04:45,895 --> 00:04:47,381
Rym: I stopped on Randall's Island.

88
00:04:47,441 --> 00:04:49,990
Rym: I was about seven and a half miles into the thirteen mile run.

89
00:04:50,313 --> 00:04:51,550
Scott: Where on Randall's Island did you stop?

90
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:52,769
Rym: Near ICANN Stadium.

91
00:04:53,773 --> 00:04:54,670
Scott: Okay, over by the stadium.

92
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:59,087
Rym: And because the cops were gathering there for some reason, I was like, "What the fuck is going

93
00:04:59,328 --> 00:04:59,368
Rym: on?".

94
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:13,490
Rym: Because there were so many cops there, and they had all the riot police gear, and all the sergeants were lined up, and it looked like the sergeants were all addressing the police, and they were holding the riot helmets.

95
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,399
Rym: And I was like, "What fucker is this?

96
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,968
Rym: Gonna tweet just in case some shit's going down.

97
00:05:18,988 --> 00:05:19,369
Rym: What's going

98
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:19,470
Rym: on?".

99
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:22,806
Rym: So I stopped, take pictures, can't really figure out what's going on.

100
00:05:22,846 --> 00:05:23,569
Rym: I tweet about it.

101
00:05:24,212 --> 00:05:28,450
Rym: And then I'm walking toward the bridge to get back on the RFK to do the rest of my run.

102
00:05:30,351 --> 00:05:39,630
Rym: And I'm looking at my phone, and suddenly this guy on a bike who is riding on the sidewalk stops in front of me suddenly and starts yelling at me to get out of his way.

103
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,295
Rym: Now, there's a bike lane in the street.

104
00:05:43,896 --> 00:05:44,859
Rym: Also, you're an adult.

105
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:47,124
Rym: You shouldn't be biking on the sidewalk, but whatever.

106
00:05:47,144 --> 00:05:48,347
Rym: I ignore him.

107
00:05:48,407 --> 00:05:49,830
Rym: I just kind of laugh and keep walking.

108
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:54,308
Scott: There is a very brief area there where they put a tiny strip of, like, bike/walk.

109
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,401
Rym: Oh, this is way past that.

110
00:05:56,421 --> 00:05:57,630
Rym: Way past that.

111
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:00,369
Scott: Well, it's right at the entrance to the bridge.

112
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,513
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

113
00:06:02,554 --> 00:06:04,458
Rym: But where we were is way, way, way past that.

114
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:09,530
Rym: There's that really narrow, like, a little over, like, barely two feet wide, old sidewalk.

115
00:06:10,558 --> 00:06:10,789
Scott: Okay.

116
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:11,994
Rym: I don't know why this dude's biking.

117
00:06:12,034 --> 00:06:12,415
Rym: Whatever.

118
00:06:12,636 --> 00:06:16,730
Rym: He yells at me, and, like, I get out of his way, and I kind of laugh and just keep walking.

119
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,534
Rym: I didn't even flip him off yet.

120
00:06:18,635 --> 00:06:23,770
Rym: Like, I didn't even, like, do anything, because, you know, I was going to flip that dude off, but I didn't.

121
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:26,630
Rym: I was still just, like, laughing, like, whatever, because I was in the middle of my tweet.

122
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,360
Scott: How do you flip someone off when you're holding your phone?

123
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,789
Scott: You've got to put the phone away, then you get the thing.

124
00:06:30,131 --> 00:06:30,271
Rym: Exactly.

125
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:37,870
Rym: So, before I can even flip the dude off, because I start laughing a little bit, he starts following me, yelling at me about disrespecting him.

126
00:06:38,611 --> 00:06:44,790
Rym: And then he starts threatening to fight me, and wants to, and he's throwing slurs out, and he, like, he's about to punch me.

127
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:52,850
Rym: So, I, like, back off, like, fast, and I start recording him, because, you know, if he's going to fight me, like, I'm going to have to deal with the police at some point.

128
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:55,777
Rym: So, I have the camera up, and I'm like, "I got video, dude.

129
00:06:55,817 --> 00:06:56,058
Rym: What the

130
00:06:56,138 --> 00:06:56,459
Rym: fuck?".

131
00:06:56,941 --> 00:06:58,827
Rym: And he keeps, and now he changes his tune.

132
00:06:58,847 --> 00:06:59,630
Rym: He still wants to fight me.

133
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:03,382
Rym: He's aggressively chasing me, but he's yelling, "Put the phone down.

134
00:07:03,462 --> 00:07:05,368
Rym: Put the phone down, so we can settle this like

135
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:05,449
Rym: men.".

136
00:07:06,451 --> 00:07:07,675
Rym: And I'm just like, "Fuck you.

137
00:07:07,936 --> 00:07:08,579
Rym: Leave me alone.

138
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,823
Rym: I'm videoing you.

139
00:07:09,843 --> 00:07:10,586
Rym: I'm going to call the

140
00:07:10,606 --> 00:07:10,967
Rym: cops.".

141
00:07:11,008 --> 00:07:11,650
Rym: Like, what the fuck?

142
00:07:12,011 --> 00:07:14,041
Rym: Now, I don't actually want to call the cops.

143
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,488
Rym: I just want this dude to go away.

144
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:16,530
Rym: Yeah.

145
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:22,410
Rym: Because if I call the cops, like, he might get shot, and, eh, I don't really want that to happen, even though this dude is a super piece of shit.

146
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:31,290
Rym: So, I do something I have done multiple times in my life, and the reason I'm telling this story, and taking some time to tell it, is that this works.

147
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:43,190
Rym: So, this dude, clearly, like, he's getting to the point where he's about to, like, try to punch me and take my phone to get rid of the recording, or to not have a recording of him fighting with me, because I guess he thinks he's going to win this fight.

148
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:47,550
Rym: I don't think he realized that if it had come to a fight, I was going to kick him in the nads so hard.

149
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,239
Scott: That's what I would have done.

150
00:07:49,701 --> 00:07:51,310
Scott: That's exactly my plan, as well.

151
00:07:53,496 --> 00:07:54,209
Scott: I have to hit you.

152
00:07:54,750 --> 00:08:00,129
Rym: So, I put my phone up, like, I fucks with it, and I act like I'm on the phone with 911 while I'm backing up from him.

153
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,401
Rym: I'm not actually on the phone with 911.

154
00:08:02,401 --> 00:08:03,990
Rym: I'm, in fact, still recording video.

155
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,359
Rym: So, and I'm like, "911?

156
00:08:07,359 --> 00:08:08,665
Rym: Yeah, no, this guy's threatening me.

157
00:08:08,966 --> 00:08:09,228
Rym: Yes?

158
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:09,770
Rym: Yeah?".

159
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:28,930
Rym: And I'm, like, doing this whole bit, and the dude keeps trying to act like he wants to fight me, and he's still following me, but as soon as I start describing his appearance in detail, and where he is, to nobody, he starts to back off a little bit, and obviously is frightened, but his machismo is still too up, and he doesn't want to, like, admit that he lost.

160
00:08:29,612 --> 00:08:33,702
Rym: So, eventually, I'm like, "Yeah, he's got a tattoo on his right leg.

161
00:08:34,183 --> 00:08:35,326
Rym: Yeah, he's still following me.

162
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:36,929
Rym: Yeah, I can stick

163
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:37,070
Rym: around.".

164
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,917
Rym: And then he starts to back off, like, at that point.

165
00:08:39,957 --> 00:08:43,470
Rym: Like, I think he realizes that he thinks I actually did call the police.

166
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,156
Rym: They're on the way, and he's in trouble.

167
00:08:45,718 --> 00:08:48,930
Rym: So, he starts to leave slowly, unrelatedly.

168
00:08:50,192 --> 00:08:51,475
Rym: I could not have timed this better.

169
00:08:51,877 --> 00:08:57,855
Rym: An ambulance is going by, like, way off in the distance, and it runs a red light, and it blips its sirens.

170
00:08:58,115 --> 00:09:02,970
Rym: while it runs the red light, and I can see this, because it's way behind him, but he's still looking at me.

171
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,836
Rym: When that siren goes brrrrp, I wave.

172
00:09:07,236 --> 00:09:12,706
Rym: I wave, like, "Hey, cot," like, whoever, and he fucking books.

173
00:09:13,067 --> 00:09:14,289
Rym: He is gone so fast.

174
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:16,465
Scott: That's right.

175
00:09:17,632 --> 00:09:19,301
Rym: I didn't actually call the police, because whatever.

176
00:09:19,321 --> 00:09:20,910
Rym: I think I scared that guy enough.

177
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:22,269
Rym: It works.

178
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:23,377
Rym: That's the end of my story.

179
00:09:23,418 --> 00:09:24,910
Rym: That's just what happened to me, randomly.

180
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,127
Scott: Okay.

181
00:09:27,754 --> 00:09:28,889
Rym: So, uh, you got any tech news?

182
00:09:30,131 --> 00:09:30,532
Scott: Uh, there is.

183
00:09:30,552 --> 00:09:31,535
Scott: There's a tiny tech news.

184
00:09:31,555 --> 00:09:36,350
Scott: So, I don't know how many people are aware of this company, uh, called Sling, right?

185
00:09:37,031 --> 00:09:48,730
Scott: Uh, I've been aware of them since, like, the mid-2000s, because my boss at my first job out of college was, like, a very early customer of theirs, and was bragging because he thought it was just so cool, their technology.

186
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:56,527
Scott: So, what the Sling box is, if you don't know, is you, for some reason, buy cable or satellite television.

187
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:57,910
Scott: Why the hell you do that?

188
00:09:59,673 --> 00:10:15,530
Scott: Um, and you connect this box up to it, uh, I guess, after your cable box or whatever, in between your television, and what you can do with this box is then, on any of your other devices in the world, right, you would run the Sling software, like a little application.

189
00:10:16,331 --> 00:10:28,310
Scott: And what you do is you connect to your own television, right, your own cable that you're paying for is rebroadcasting itself over the internet to you and only you.

190
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:33,530
Scott: So, it's like you're, you're not pirating the television because you're paying for it, right?

191
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:41,970
Scott: But, like, when you watch pirate television on the internet, you're watching someone else Slinging to a million people, or whoever many people are pirating and watching, right?

192
00:10:42,073 --> 00:10:42,210
Scott: Yeah.

193
00:10:43,152 --> 00:10:46,550
Scott: Now, this is a legal stream from yourself to yourself.

194
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:51,570
Rym: As far as I can tell, the legality of the Sling box stuff was never, like, fully determined, but it seemed like it was working.

195
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:56,970
Scott: But no one cared because it wasn't taking money away from cable companies, and they weren't even offering a competing feature?

196
00:10:57,455 --> 00:10:57,605
Rym: Yup.

197
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:58,507
Scott: Right?

198
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:02,381
Scott: It feels like it was in the spectrum of, like, using a VCR.

199
00:11:02,401 --> 00:11:04,608
Rym: Like, you're shifting to yourself.

200
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:05,210
Rym: So, eh.

201
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:13,207
Scott: Yeah, it's like you paid for it, you're paying for the Sling service on top of that from another vendor, and you're streaming your own cable to you live, right?

202
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,655
Scott: And, you know, of course, you know, it's like it's your own cable.

203
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:22,470
Scott: So, like, let's say Rym is at home and I'm using Rym's Sling, right, because he shared his Sling account with me.

204
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:25,169
Rym: Because that's what I would have done if I had a Sling, that's what I would do.

205
00:11:25,991 --> 00:11:26,473
Scott: That's right.

206
00:11:26,493 --> 00:11:30,350
Scott: So, Rym is watching the hockey game, and I'm watching the hockey game, right?

207
00:11:31,032 --> 00:11:36,245
Scott: But then, you know, the hockey game's over, and Rym switches to Owl House, right?

208
00:11:36,525 --> 00:11:37,087
Scott: Well, guess what?

209
00:11:37,187 --> 00:11:38,250
Scott: I'm watching Owl House now.

210
00:11:39,971 --> 00:11:42,398
Scott: The cable box can't be on two channels at once.

211
00:11:42,478 --> 00:11:46,690
Scott: It's not, like, you're streaming literally whatever the cable box is watching.

212
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:47,892
Rym: That's how they get you.

213
00:11:47,952 --> 00:11:54,890
Rym: In fact, in the old TVs, you kids might be too young to remember, TVs got this feature, picture in picture, and it was a big deal at the time.

214
00:11:55,656 --> 00:11:56,510
Rym: But to make it work...

215
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,589
Scott: They needed two cable boxes.

216
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:05,250
Rym: Yep, you either had to have two cable boxes, or you had to have a splitter before the cable box, and then only the non-premium channels would work in the picture in picture.

217
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:14,010
Scott: Yeah, anyway, so Sling was a pretty cool thing for people who weren't super technologically advanced, a way to pay money to get this feature.

218
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:23,310
Scott: Obviously, very technologically advanced people would use a computer with a capture card and some open source software, right, to set up a DVR kind of situation.

219
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:29,530
Scott: I think DVRs also really made Sling largely unnecessary, right, because you could just record whatever it is that you were...

220
00:12:29,831 --> 00:12:33,709
Rym: I feel like Sling was used primarily for sports.

221
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:39,165
Scott: Yeah, the other thing with Sling is that it doesn't save you money, it costs you more money, right?

222
00:12:39,185 --> 00:12:40,209
Scott: People want to move toward...

223
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:44,670
Rym: Yeah, Sling sold this, this wasn't like a little prod, like, you buy their hardware.

224
00:12:45,471 --> 00:12:48,561
Scott: Yeah, you get the hardware, you pay for the service, and it has a subscription.

225
00:12:48,581 --> 00:12:51,410
Scott: The point is, Sling is dead, RIP, rest in peace.

226
00:12:51,870 --> 00:13:01,450
Scott: They're shutting it down, they're not making any more Sling products, they're discontinuing all their service, and I think they said two years from now, everything that people have will just be bricked.

227
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:06,264
Scott: So, the end of Sling is here, not really surprised.

228
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,870
Scott: I'm more surprised it lasted this long.

229
00:13:08,312 --> 00:13:10,230
Rym: I didn't know it was still around, to be honest.

230
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,050
Scott: I think it's at least 15 years old, right?

231
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:19,670
Rym: When you sent me this news, I was literally about to respond with a slowpoke gif, and then I saw that it was actually current real news from today.

232
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:21,587
Scott: Yeah, it is.

233
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,250
Rym: Breaking news on GeekNights here.

234
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:29,659
Scott: Even so, their technology did work incredibly well, even in the earliest days.

235
00:13:29,699 --> 00:13:34,850
Scott: That boss I told you about, who was like my boss at my first post-college job, who was showing it off.

236
00:13:35,471 --> 00:13:51,270
Scott: I remember him having Sling set up at his house, and he would watch, he had a, you know, like, this is Blackberry era, pre-iPhone, 2004, 2005, and he had, what is it called, Windows CE in those days, I think, right?

237
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:59,610
Scott: So, I think he had a Windows CE-based smart, you know, PalmPilot thing, and he could watch the Sling video on that.

238
00:14:00,151 --> 00:14:08,230
Scott: And he also, also in the office, at the time that I was there, they upgraded the whole phone system in the office.

239
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:15,989
Scott: So, we all got new phones that were all, you know, VoIP phones that were hooked up to software on the computer and, you know, everything, right?

240
00:14:17,651 --> 00:14:18,929
Scott: And it's all Windows XP, right?

241
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:28,970
Scott: So, but the, he, on his desk, because he's a CTO, right, got the fanciest model of VoIP phone, right, to put on the desk.

242
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:38,346
Scott: And that model of VoIP phone ran Windows CE, and he installed the Sling app on it, and he watched TV on the VoIP phone in 2005, right, ish.

243
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:47,410
Rym: That is, that is a similar energy to that time when we were in college, driving to PenguinCon, and we had an access point in the car.

244
00:14:48,251 --> 00:15:00,590
Scott: Right, the point is, Sling was an impressive technological feat of, like, video encryption, you know, from point to point over the internet, you know, with quality management, lag management, and such, right?

245
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:08,050
Scott: But just as a useful consumer product, the price they charge, you know, not worth it, they didn't make money.

246
00:15:09,292 --> 00:15:11,208
Scott: But yeah, a notable, interesting thing.

247
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:17,907
Rym: Yeah, this fact doesn't fuck around either, it's like, question, will Slingbox be releasing any new products?

248
00:15:18,108 --> 00:15:18,810
Rym: Answer, no.

249
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:20,510
Rym: No, we're done.

250
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:21,696
Rym: What about support?

251
00:15:21,817 --> 00:15:23,870
Rym: Fuck you, is basically what it says.

252
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:34,150
Scott: So, I mean, on the one hand, I wouldn't never use their products, because I would never pay for cable anymore, but on the other hand, I sort of, like, you know, respect what they did.

253
00:15:34,772 --> 00:15:36,129
Rym: Yeah, they got away with it.

254
00:15:37,051 --> 00:15:40,550
Scott: It's a little sad, it's a little bit sad to see them go, but also, indifferent.

255
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:53,010
Rym: Yeah, well, because it's kind of like, it's one of those situations where if you or I, like you alluded to earlier, wanted to do something like this, we'd just use some open source software and the extra PCs we always have lying around and just, like, make it happen.

256
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:56,357
Rym: But normal people don't really have that.

257
00:15:56,417 --> 00:16:00,030
Rym: Most people don't just have, like, an extra computer laying around, or five.

258
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:01,179
Scott: Mm-hmm.

259
00:16:01,871 --> 00:16:14,530
Rym: So, in some other news, we do a lot of technology news on GeekNights Mondays, but very rarely do we do science news, partly because we're not experts in a lot of scientific fields, most scientific, all scientific fields.

260
00:16:15,355 --> 00:16:15,968
Rym: Almost all.

261
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:22,977
Rym: I'd say I'm a lay expert in, like, a handful of areas I have deep hobby interests in.

262
00:16:23,418 --> 00:16:30,710
Rym: But anyway, you know, we have not done, I don't think ever, in the 15 years we've been doing GeekNights, an arithmetic news.

263
00:16:31,596 --> 00:16:31,867
Scott: Okay.

264
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,682
Scott: Not, you wouldn't think- Did someone solve one of the problems?

265
00:16:35,064 --> 00:16:39,422
Rym: The, uh- Yeah, I'm not talking, like, maths, like, general math, like, theory of math.

266
00:16:39,482 --> 00:16:41,830
Rym: I'm talking pure arithmetic.

267
00:16:42,552 --> 00:16:43,168
Rym: Oh, okay.

268
00:16:43,411 --> 00:16:45,930
Rym: Like, how to multiply two numbers together.

269
00:16:46,571 --> 00:16:47,489
Scott: Well, I know how to do that.

270
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:52,069
Rym: There has been a relatively recent advancement from April of this year.

271
00:16:53,034 --> 00:16:53,165
Rym: What?

272
00:16:53,971 --> 00:17:08,050
Scott: In how to multiply two numbers together in a- Are you sure this isn't one of those things where someone way long ago in, like, India or Persia already discovered this, and someone rediscovered it, and they're pretending like they invented it?

273
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:08,371
Rym: No.

274
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:16,230
Rym: In fact, in 1960, a Russian mathematician basically finally, like, for millennia, it was- I'm quoting the article here.

275
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:23,170
Rym: For millennia, it was widely assumed that there was, in fact, no faster way to multiply numbers than the way that we all know.

276
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:24,519
Rym: The way you all learn.

277
00:17:24,598 --> 00:17:25,648
Rym: The way I multiply numbers.

278
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:26,488
Rym: To this day.

279
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:27,165
Scott: Memorize it.

280
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:28,539
Rym: Well, for times tables.

281
00:17:28,862 --> 00:17:30,512
Rym: But, you know, you take- You have two numbers.

282
00:17:31,013 --> 00:17:36,550
Rym: You take the bottom number, and you multiply every digit of the bottom number by every digit of the top number.

283
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:40,302
Rym: And then you just do that, adding powers of ten as you go down.

284
00:17:40,342 --> 00:17:41,365
Rym: You carry everything.

285
00:17:41,787 --> 00:17:42,710
Rym: That's how you multiply.

286
00:17:43,571 --> 00:17:47,130
Rym: For thousands of years, no one came up with a faster or better way to do it.

287
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:50,850
Scott: Pretty sure that in other countries, they teach the children to multiply it with a different way.

288
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:51,756
Rym: No, that way.

289
00:17:51,877 --> 00:17:53,550
Rym: That way is the fundamental way.

290
00:17:53,891 --> 00:17:58,952
Rym: Times tables and small ones, maybe, but multiplying two numbers with a large number of digits- Isn't there a way you can do it?

291
00:17:58,992 --> 00:18:04,930
Scott: by drawing, like, lines, and then drawing lines across the other way, and then circling the intersections, and then grouping them?

292
00:18:06,071 --> 00:18:11,270
Rym: Yeah, but that's not faster, and more importantly, it's not faster computationally.

293
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:18,126
Rym: All those methods require n to the two time, n being the total number of digits of the two numbers.

294
00:18:19,169 --> 00:18:19,610
Rym: Give or take.

295
00:18:20,611 --> 00:18:28,828
Rym: So, in the '60s, a Russian mathematician basically said, "Yeah, we're pretty sure there's no faster way to do

296
00:18:28,928 --> 00:18:28,968
Rym: it.".

297
00:18:31,591 --> 00:18:35,042
Rym: And this other guy just recently found a way.

298
00:18:35,945 --> 00:18:37,550
Rym: After a week of searching, I guess?

299
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:37,880
Scott: What's the way?

300
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,190
Scott: How do I do it?

301
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:38,877
Rym: You can read this article.

302
00:18:39,403 --> 00:18:40,090
Rym: This way is legit.

303
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:44,650
Scott: Can we make computers change to do it this way instead of the way they do it now?

304
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,749
Rym: Yes, the only reason this is interesting- Binary computers, not quantum ones?

305
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:58,270
Rym: This way is not really faster for a human to do, because very rarely will a human multiply two very long numbers by hand.

306
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:02,689
Rym: Very rarely are you going to multiply two 20-digit numbers by each other for funsies.

307
00:19:04,151 --> 00:19:14,970
Rym: And the methods outlined here, you can go to this website, it's pretty straightforward, but basically, it makes the computational time to multiply two numbers together be linear.

308
00:19:15,892 --> 00:19:17,149
Rym: That's a big deal.

309
00:19:19,675 --> 00:19:20,390
Scott: Big if true.

310
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:23,875
Rym: This article does a really good job of explaining it.

311
00:19:24,316 --> 00:19:41,390
Rym: I cannot paraphrase this article, because I am not up on modern theory of math or modern arithmetic or any of this, but if you read the article, it will explain it at a level of detail that you will understand, and it has a very good visual diagram of how this works and why it saves time.

312
00:19:42,491 --> 00:20:01,530
Scott: I'd be very interested to see someone take an FPGA or something and set it up to multiply that way, instead of with the existing circuits, and see not only how much faster it is, because computers do a lot of multiplying, but also how much power it saves.

313
00:20:01,912 --> 00:20:03,290
Rym: You can read the article to see all the details.

314
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:06,365
Scott: I don't know how many more transistors you'll need, because I haven't read anything.

315
00:20:06,385 --> 00:20:07,129
Scott: I don't know anything about it.

316
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:09,672
Rym: There's a great quote here.

317
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:40,410
Rym: Except in the context of doing multiplication.

318
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:43,148
Rym: And this article made multiplication interesting to me.

319
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:50,567
Rym: Anyway, things of the day.

320
00:20:50,607 --> 00:20:51,170
Rym: What do you got?

321
00:20:52,190 --> 00:21:02,589
Scott: So, much like many people do, when you discover a thing, sometimes you fall down some sort of hole on YouTube and consume all of that thing, right?

322
00:21:03,211 --> 00:21:06,090
Scott: And then when you're a nerd, you just gotta tell someone about that thing, right?

323
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:07,616
Scott: So it all started.

324
00:21:07,676 --> 00:21:10,809
Scott: I was watching some worthless K-pop video, right?

325
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:16,950
Scott: Where Seulgi from Red Velvet was answering stupid questions, because those are the only kind of questions you're allowed to ask idols, right?

326
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:22,129
Scott: And someone asks her a question, and they say, "Hey, when you go to the karaoke, what song do you

327
00:21:22,169 --> 00:21:22,330
Scott: sing?".

328
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:28,849
Scott: And you're thinking, "She's probably just gonna say, might not even give a specific answer, because it might be

329
00:21:28,869 --> 00:21:29,150
Scott: controversial.".

330
00:21:29,911 --> 00:21:32,569
Scott: What if she mentions a singer who got in trouble or something, right?

331
00:21:33,372 --> 00:21:35,920
Scott: And the song she says is "Bakwa" by Lee Jung Hyun.

332
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:40,550
Scott: Alright.

333
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,069
Scott: Have you ever heard that song in your life?

334
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:42,961
Rym: No.

335
00:21:44,151 --> 00:21:44,688
Scott: Yes, you have.

336
00:21:45,654 --> 00:21:46,419
Rym: I should clarify that.

337
00:21:46,801 --> 00:21:48,110
Rym: Almost definitely, I've heard it.

338
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:49,372
Scott: That's right.

339
00:21:49,432 --> 00:21:52,421
Scott: So, when I heard that, I was like, "What?

340
00:21:52,963 --> 00:21:54,046
Scott: Is that that song?

341
00:21:54,428 --> 00:21:54,909
Scott: Is it that

342
00:21:54,949 --> 00:21:55,150
Scott: song?".

343
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,429
Scott: And I looked up, and yes, it was.

344
00:21:57,272 --> 00:22:05,650
Scott: In the year 2000, when we played Dance Dance Revolution, the mix that was available at the time was third mix.

345
00:22:06,691 --> 00:22:08,717
Scott: And it was well known, right?

346
00:22:08,737 --> 00:22:13,170
Scott: Because fourth mix came out shortly thereafter, and then fifth, and then we sort of played less after that.

347
00:22:13,651 --> 00:22:14,053
Rym: Yep.

348
00:22:14,073 --> 00:22:16,570
Rym: I mean, I play a lot more now because of COVID, but anyway.

349
00:22:17,131 --> 00:22:17,392
Scott: Sure.

350
00:22:17,452 --> 00:22:20,162
Scott: It was well known that there was a special third mix.

351
00:22:20,905 --> 00:22:22,250
Scott: The Korean third mix.

352
00:22:22,432 --> 00:22:23,110
Rym: Oh, shit.

353
00:22:24,072 --> 00:22:32,230
Scott: And in the Korean third mix, there were two of the songs from third mix had been removed, but I think maybe six or eight songs had been added.

354
00:22:33,591 --> 00:22:38,285
Scott: And one of those special added songs in third mix Korean was indeed

355
00:22:38,306 --> 00:22:38,406
Scott: "Bakwa."

356
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:40,132
Scott: "Bakwa!"

357
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:40,393
Scott: "Bakwa!"

358
00:22:40,614 --> 00:22:40,816
Scott: "Bakwa!"

359
00:22:40,836 --> 00:22:41,117
Scott: "Bakwa!"

360
00:22:41,137 --> 00:22:41,258
Scott: "Bakwa!"

361
00:22:41,479 --> 00:22:41,841
Scott: "Bakwa!"

362
00:22:41,901 --> 00:22:42,384
Scott: "Bakwa!"

363
00:22:42,525 --> 00:22:42,625
Scott: "Bakwa!"

364
00:22:42,645 --> 00:22:42,826
Scott: "Bakwa!"

365
00:22:42,907 --> 00:22:43,329
Scott: "Bakwa!".

366
00:22:43,971 --> 00:22:45,275
Scott: And it was that song.

367
00:22:45,636 --> 00:22:55,730
Scott: So now, now that I find that for some reason I've been listening to K-Pop shit for almost a decade, it had never known, right, what the hell that song was or who the hell sang it, right?

368
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:57,154
Rym: I never thought about it.

369
00:22:57,174 --> 00:23:01,168
Rym: It was the song I played because the third mix Korean machine was 25 cents for five songs in

370
00:23:01,188 --> 00:23:01,589
Rym: "Wildwood."

371
00:23:02,711 --> 00:23:02,892
Rym: Right.

372
00:23:03,233 --> 00:23:06,485
Scott: So there was also another song in third mix Korean,

373
00:23:06,645 --> 00:23:07,027
Scott: "Wah."

374
00:23:07,769 --> 00:23:07,930
Scott: Right?

375
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:15,050
Scott: *sings* That is also Lee Jung Hyun.

376
00:23:16,551 --> 00:23:25,650
Scott: So now I'm like, well, who the hell was this Lee Jung Hyun person making these songs in our, you know, mid-2000s techno dance style, right?

377
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:29,601
Scott: This person, Lee Jung Hyun, is a ridiculous person.

378
00:23:29,621 --> 00:23:32,250
Scott: The Koreans have been keeping secret from everybody, right?

379
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:35,039
Scott: So she's like, I think she's like 40 now.

380
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,308
Scott: So I guess then she was like 20-ish, right?

381
00:23:38,151 --> 00:23:41,489
Scott: She's a really tiny person, like a little tiny person.

382
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:46,884
Scott: And singing, I mean, she sings like a drunk person at a karaoke, right?

383
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:48,690
Scott: It's like, she doesn't have a lot of range.

384
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:51,450
Scott: But she can sing with the range she has, right?

385
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:55,323
Scott: Dancing, it's like, does she have a lot of dancing technique?

386
00:23:55,364 --> 00:23:56,869
Scott: I mean, more than we do, right?

387
00:23:57,171 --> 00:23:59,230
Scott: But not like the K-Pop people you have today.

388
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:04,431
Rym: Not the height of the craft that molds these people into entertaining machines in the year 2020.

389
00:24:04,431 --> 00:24:05,335
Scott: No, not even close.

390
00:24:05,395 --> 00:24:09,410
Scott: But when she dances, she's like a drunk person at a karaoke.

391
00:24:09,571 --> 00:24:11,049
Scott: She's just like so excited.

392
00:24:12,132 --> 00:24:14,886
Rym: You know what that gives me a similar energy to?

393
00:24:14,946 --> 00:24:15,610
Rym: Captain Jack.

394
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:19,800
Scott: She's pretty much Korean female Captain Jack.

395
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:25,434
Scott: But another comparison would be, I think someone said, "Ah, Lee Jung Hyun, Korea's Lady

396
00:24:25,474 --> 00:24:27,639
Scott: Gaga.".

397
00:24:27,979 --> 00:24:30,384
Scott: And the reply was like, "No, no, no, no, no, no.

398
00:24:31,105 --> 00:24:33,009
Scott: Lady Gaga is the US's Lee Jung

399
00:24:33,089 --> 00:24:33,270
Scott: Hyun.".

400
00:24:34,292 --> 00:24:42,170
Scott: So she obviously doesn't have the musical talent of Lady Gaga, who actually can really sing and play instruments and write music.

401
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:50,810
Scott: But in terms of every different song she has, she's got a totally different aesthetic and different stage going on.

402
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:56,724
Scott: Like one stage, she's wearing weird alien stuff.

403
00:24:56,905 --> 00:24:59,070
Scott: And another stage, it's like disco time, right?

404
00:24:59,812 --> 00:25:04,789
Scott: Every single time she comes back, she's got something ridiculous and some kind of gimmick going on.

405
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:07,674
Scott: It's just too fun.

406
00:25:07,955 --> 00:25:12,610
Scott: And obviously if you're a DDR type person, you're probably going to enjoy most of this person's music.

407
00:25:14,214 --> 00:25:19,530
Scott: So I went and I watched, there's not that many of them because her career was in the past mostly.

408
00:25:20,592 --> 00:25:22,056
Scott: She's mostly an actress actually.

409
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,726
Scott: She's actually popular in China and Japan as well.

410
00:25:25,766 --> 00:25:27,150
Scott: I guess they weren't telling us either.

411
00:25:28,491 --> 00:25:35,310
Scott: But the point is, my thing of the day is the best single performance of Lee Jung Hyun that I could find.

412
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:39,721
Scott: The one that is the best one of this song called "Micha," I guess.

413
00:25:40,583 --> 00:25:41,265
Scott: M-I-C-H.

414
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:42,549
Scott: It's a Korean word.

415
00:25:42,649 --> 00:25:42,950
Scott: I don't know.

416
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:49,781
Scott: But yeah, if you like that sort of thing, if you go to YouTube, there's an hour long video.

417
00:25:49,821 --> 00:25:54,150
Scott: that's like every single song she did, at least every title track worth listening to.

418
00:25:54,270 --> 00:26:00,889
Rym: Oh no, I just went into my NAS to check on something because I have every DDR that was ever officially released for StepMania, obviously.

419
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:03,540
Rym: I have 3rd Mix and 3rd Mix Plus.

420
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,750
Rym: I don't have 3rd Mix Korean.

421
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:06,026
Scott: No, you're missing 8 songs.

422
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:07,270
Rym: I'm missing those 8 songs.

423
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:08,776
Scott: However many it is.

424
00:26:09,218 --> 00:26:11,550
Scott: They might have been in later mixes though, I don't know.

425
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:12,048
Rym: Yeah, I got it.

426
00:26:12,934 --> 00:26:15,387
Scott: I feel like Wah might have been in 5th Mix.

427
00:26:15,488 --> 00:26:15,890
Scott: I don't know.

428
00:26:16,571 --> 00:26:20,199
Rym: Once I hit after 8th Mix, I kind of lose track of what's where.

429
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:24,729
Rym: And a lot of old songs like re-emerged in like X2 or X3.

430
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:29,028
Scott: But yeah, so it only took 20 years to figure out who this person was.

431
00:26:30,831 --> 00:26:33,509
Scott: And then they have earned the right to be a thing of the day.

432
00:26:34,391 --> 00:26:37,949
Rym: It was funny, as soon as you said "bakwa," the whole song played in my head.

433
00:26:38,651 --> 00:26:39,173
Scott: Exactly.

434
00:26:39,293 --> 00:26:44,830
Scott: And a lot of the other songs, I'm not sure if they were in DDR, but they have this ring of familiarity.

435
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:48,389
Scott: And I can't tell where I've heard them before or if I've heard them before.

436
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:50,886
Scott: Because they sound like 2000s techno songs.

437
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,490
Rym: Which is actually some of my favorite aesthetics.

438
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:56,818
Scott: Yeah, but some songs, she switches up the genres too.

439
00:26:56,839 --> 00:26:59,888
Scott: There's one song, she was just punk rockin' on stage.

440
00:26:59,908 --> 00:27:00,430
Scott: She doesn't care.

441
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:01,510
Scott: Whatever.

442
00:27:01,933 --> 00:27:02,335
Rym: Alright.

443
00:27:02,859 --> 00:27:04,650
Rym: So my thing is a very short fiction.

444
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:09,890
Rym: This is a science fiction story, narrated with a little like, animatic-looking animation on YouTube.

445
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:12,189
Rym: It's 3 minutes and 42 seconds long.

446
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:17,850
Rym: And, you know, we've reviewed a lot of different science fiction over the years.

447
00:27:18,431 --> 00:27:24,930
Rym: Like, we talked about some Bradbury and some Heinlein and in the book club at some point we'll talk about in the future different science fiction.

448
00:27:25,832 --> 00:27:27,409
Scott: Old 20th century white guy sci-fi.

449
00:27:27,751 --> 00:27:27,991
Rym: Yep.

450
00:27:28,212 --> 00:27:33,870
Rym: But there's a lot of non-white guy sci-fi and a lot of different kinds of science fiction.

451
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:39,630
Rym: Some of my favorite science fiction stories are the ones that almost have a sort of form as function.

452
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:45,849
Rym: Where they're written in an odd way or they're very very short, like micro-fiction is something I'm a big fan of.

453
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,594
Rym: And this is a story.

454
00:27:48,734 --> 00:27:51,500
Rym: It's titled "My Job is to Open and Close

455
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:51,740
Rym: Doors.".

456
00:27:52,351 --> 00:27:55,690
Rym: It is 3 minutes and 42 seconds long, including the credits.

457
00:27:56,331 --> 00:28:05,510
Rym: And it is the story told from the perspective of an AI whose job is to open and close the doors on a spaceship.

458
00:28:06,691 --> 00:28:10,190
Scott: Oh, so I thought it was going to be the grocery store door opening device.

459
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:14,770
Rym: Oh, it's that kind of device, but it controls the doors on a spaceship.

460
00:28:15,211 --> 00:28:24,190
Rym: But it's written from the point of view of an AI that has to figure stuff out based on what it knows about the world.

461
00:28:25,831 --> 00:28:27,758
Rym: And the story is good, like.

462
00:28:27,838 --> 00:28:31,450
Rym: it's 4 minutes long, not even, so like, spoilers, whatever.

463
00:28:32,151 --> 00:28:39,650
Rym: But basically, the thing starts and a person goes into the airlock and hits the button and the AI is ready to open the door.

464
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:44,184
Rym: But the AI is like, "Wait, the person is not wearing a helmet.

465
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:45,228
Rym: Does that

466
00:28:45,408 --> 00:28:45,750
Rym: matter?".

467
00:28:46,293 --> 00:28:47,300
Rym: And that's the story.

468
00:28:47,561 --> 00:28:48,749
Rym: Like, what's going on?

469
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:49,192
Scott: Of course.

470
00:28:49,212 --> 00:28:50,200
Scott: I mean, that was sort of obvious.

471
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,369
Scott: that's where that story was going to go.

472
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:52,714
Rym: Yeah, it was.

473
00:28:52,895 --> 00:28:57,470
Rym: The story is really well framed, partly because of the way it's told.

474
00:28:58,191 --> 00:29:11,070
Rym: Like, the AI will interrupt itself to try to figure things out about humans or the world, but does not have all of the necessary information to figure these things out and is trying to make a path toward a decision point.

475
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,437
Rym: It's just really, really well done.

476
00:29:13,477 --> 00:29:16,190
Rym: Like, this thing is great and I encourage you to listen to the whole thing.

477
00:29:16,673 --> 00:29:19,270
Scott: If you don't have an attention span for that, I don't know what to tell you.

478
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:19,935
Scott: That's my style.

479
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,245
Scott: That's my style.

480
00:29:21,286 --> 00:29:21,810
Scott: I'll check that out.

481
00:29:22,072 --> 00:29:22,538
Rym: You'll like it.

482
00:29:22,619 --> 00:29:23,509
Rym: I think you'll like it a lot.

483
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:27,541
Rym: In a moment, we actually have some really important meta news.

484
00:29:27,561 --> 00:29:29,309
Rym: We've talked about this off and on.

485
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:39,390
Rym: If you don't know, there is a GitHub repository where we have been workshopping a new code of conduct for the broader GeekNights community.

486
00:29:40,431 --> 00:29:44,110
Scott: Yeah, if you have a community on the internet these days, you gotta have a code of conduct.

487
00:29:44,231 --> 00:29:48,650
Rym: Now, we had one a long time ago, but I kind of just wrote it and then Scott added a bunch of stuff to it.

488
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:56,470
Rym: And we're two white dudes with money, so clearly there are blind spots and biases that we wouldn't have thought about.

489
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:59,055
Rym: Like, we thought like, "Oh, we should ban Nazis,".

490
00:29:59,095 --> 00:30:05,809
Rym: but there's lots of other types of behaviors that we wouldn't have thought about unless someone reminded us or prompted us or pointed at us and said, "Hey, what about

491
00:30:05,849 --> 00:30:06,009
Rym: this?".

492
00:30:07,011 --> 00:30:14,370
Scott: The point is we tried to strike a balance between accepting input from many sources and also hurrying our ass up and getting it done.

493
00:30:15,232 --> 00:30:18,310
Scott: We probably didn't balance that that well, but whatever, it doesn't matter.

494
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:28,650
Rym: We solicited feedback, and more importantly, we got a lot of implicit feedback from people complaining about what we had put forth, and that actually led to some of the parts of this policy.

495
00:30:29,691 --> 00:30:32,438
Scott: Anyway, we can't change the past.

496
00:30:32,659 --> 00:30:33,361
Scott: This is the present.

497
00:30:33,441 --> 00:30:34,784
Scott: We now have a code of conduct.

498
00:30:34,885 --> 00:30:35,707
Scott: It is now 100% in force.

499
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:53,370
Scott: So if you want to participate in any GeekNights community, whether it's an obvious one like our forum or our Discord server, or if it is even just an official GeekNights meetup at some future when we can have conventions again, or replying to us on Twitter.

500
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:59,910
Scott: It's like if you violate our code of conduct by replying to the GeekNights account on Twitter, the GeekNights account on Twitter will block you.

501
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:02,739
Rym: Now, this does not apply to my personal Twitter.

502
00:31:03,942 --> 00:31:06,070
Rym: My code of conduct is if you annoy me, I block you.

503
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:18,270
Scott: Yes, these are official GeekNights spaces, and you can read the code of conduct to get all the info, which you should, but you should also come participate in our spaces.

504
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:22,336
Scott: This is not like we now have rules and our spaces don't come.

505
00:31:22,397 --> 00:31:24,159
Scott: It's like, no, we now have rules in our spaces.

506
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:29,908
Scott: Therefore, if you have not come, or maybe if you have left, or who knows, please come.

507
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:40,325
Rym: Even if it seems obvious, it's important to state out loud why a community exists and the parameters of engagement within that community, and we have codified it.

508
00:31:40,806 --> 00:31:41,768
Rym: that was difficult to do.

509
00:31:41,788 --> 00:31:43,010
Rym: It took a while to write this thing.

510
00:31:43,911 --> 00:31:56,370
Scott: And if you want to, if you have any suggestions, if you come and look at it, and you maybe still see some problems even though it's been thought about so heavily, it will never be perfect and continue to be edited as the world changes forever.

511
00:31:56,830 --> 00:32:00,090
Rym: And because this is GeekNights Mondays, I want to point out, it is in GitHub.

512
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:01,270
Scott: Or at least as long as GeekNights exists.

513
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:04,630
Scott: It is in GitHub, and if you want to- That's right, make a pull request.

514
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:05,811
Rym: Yeah, make a pull request.

515
00:32:06,872 --> 00:32:24,990
Rym: If you have never used GitHub before, or Git before, and you don't think you're a technologist, you're listening to a Monday GeekNights, let me tell you, there is no lower stakes, zero consequences way to learn how to use Git than trying to submit a change to our code of conduct to me and Scott.

516
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:27,023
Scott: Yeah, you don't even need to know how to code.

517
00:32:27,084 --> 00:32:27,990
Scott: It's a text, right?

518
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:31,039
Scott: Yeah, like the worst case scenario, Scott doesn't- You can even just submit an issue.

519
00:32:31,059 --> 00:32:32,090
Rym: There's issues and bug tickets there.

520
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,108
Rym: Scott doesn't accept your merge request.

521
00:32:34,191 --> 00:32:35,834
Scott: Yeah, you can submit an issue.

522
00:32:36,075 --> 00:32:37,117
Scott: You can just email us.

523
00:32:37,137 --> 00:32:39,923
Scott: You can DM us on any platform, right?

524
00:32:40,444 --> 00:32:42,730
Scott: You know, as long as you don't violate the code of conduct while doing so.

525
00:32:43,911 --> 00:32:44,131
Rym: Yep.

526
00:32:45,634 --> 00:32:47,898
Rym: But we're pretty excited about this.

527
00:32:47,978 --> 00:32:54,710
Rym: We think it'll help codify this as time goes on because the GeekNights community is very fractured due to the fact that the world is different.

528
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:55,952
Rym: Forums are old.

529
00:32:56,313 --> 00:32:58,098
Rym: Mostly old people use forums.

530
00:32:58,438 --> 00:33:15,024
Scott: The Discord community- I guess most other things like podcasts, Twitch streams, any sort of content creator, a YouTube person, people don't set up forums these days.

531
00:33:15,084 --> 00:33:19,870
Scott: It's like they have their YouTube, their Instagram, their Twitter, and whatever, and that's what they have.

532
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:22,690
Rym: Maybe there's a subreddit that they may or may not control.

533
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:25,355
Scott: They might have a Discord server or a subreddit.

534
00:33:25,375 --> 00:33:29,184
Scott: People don't have forums in separate places these days, right?

535
00:33:29,565 --> 00:33:30,588
Scott: Maybe they have a Facebook page.

536
00:33:30,628 --> 00:33:31,450
Scott: I don't know what people have.

537
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:32,832
Scott: I do think forums are important.

538
00:33:32,992 --> 00:33:43,950
Rym: I think it's a lost art that we need spaces like that that are a little more slow, a little more thoughtful, longer posts, more dense content, that kind of thing.

539
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:53,210
Scott: Yeah, but I think actually those people, because they don't have the forum, they're very active on all those other platforms whereas we are less active on those other platforms.

540
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:56,940
Rym: We are more active on the GeekNights Discord than we used to be.

541
00:33:57,361 --> 00:33:58,203
Rym: I'm in there occasionally.

542
00:33:58,223 --> 00:33:58,965
Rym: Scott's in there a lot.

543
00:33:58,986 --> 00:34:00,490
Rym: I'm trying to be in there more as I have time.

544
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:01,251
Rym: Yeah,

545
00:34:01,311 --> 00:34:17,870
Scott: maybe we should try to be more active on all of them instead of just, I don't know, but regardless, they are now all governed by not only the codes of conduct on the respective platforms themselves, but also ours, at least as far as interacting in the space that GeekNights can control.

546
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:29,650
Rym: Yep, and the last thing I'll say about it is when you read it, one thing that is explicitly called out and it's relevant to the bit we talked about in the beginning, it is honestly like we don't fuck around with our terms of service.

547
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:36,442
Rym: You're not allowed to support the American Republican Party if you engage in any of our spaces, like at all.

548
00:34:36,822 --> 00:34:40,250
Rym: That is literally written in our code of conduct for a reason.

549
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:44,710
Scott: Well, if somehow there's another big switcheroo like there was decades ago...

550
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:46,009
Rym: Oh, we'll update it if it changes.

551
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:51,487
Scott: We'll update it and we'll switch it around and be like, "Oh, the Democrats are the Nazis now.

552
00:34:51,507 --> 00:34:51,848
Scott: Things

553
00:34:51,908 --> 00:34:52,309
Scott: changed.".

554
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:54,510
Rym: But right now, the Republicans are the Nazis.

555
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:55,547
Scott: That's right.

556
00:34:56,969 --> 00:35:00,470
Rym: Otherwise, Tale of Genji, we'll see if we start reading it when it's cold.

557
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:09,530
Rym: I actually started reading again a little bit this weekend because I had a poop that took longer than usual.

558
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:10,890
Scott: What a big poop.

559
00:35:11,211 --> 00:35:11,360
Rym: It was.

560
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:12,990
Scott: You ran out of things on your phone?

561
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:23,950
Rym: Well, partly because Twitter was just a sea of celebration to the point that I couldn't keep up with it and I actually broke my rule of read every tweet and just let it wash over.

562
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:27,249
Rym: I'm gonna re-engage with Twitter in a couple days when things calm down a little bit.

563
00:35:28,891 --> 00:35:34,064
Scott: I got a new phone coming on Friday, I guess, so maybe I'll read on there.

564
00:35:35,267 --> 00:35:36,190
Scott: It'll have such a nice screen.

565
00:35:36,611 --> 00:35:45,089
Rym: Alright, so before we get into the main bit, someone who's in the stream right now just asked us for a link to the Discord and since they're active and on the stream, I'm gonna post that right now.

566
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:52,690
Scott: Yeah, if you go to our website, person watching the stream at frontrowcrew.com, you'll see there's all kinds of stuff going on there.

567
00:35:53,931 --> 00:36:01,370
Scott: The website needs a big update, but all the information is still there and in the news about the code of conduct, there are links to the forum and the Discord.

568
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:06,889
Rym: Yeah, but I'm gonna send a link to the Discord right now just to this person because they seem cool.

569
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:13,830
Rym: Since we just said let's engage more with the people who are using these places, there's people in this stream, I will engage with you.

570
00:36:14,492 --> 00:36:17,350
Scott: The code of conduct does apply to you people in that YouTube live chat.

571
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:25,950
Rym: Weirdly enough, this is like a random aside, YouTube is where I've had to have the least heavy hand in moderation.

572
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:33,930
Scott: Well I think as YouTube, despite YouTube comments being a shithole, YouTube does have an automatic filter that other spaces don't have.

573
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:40,468
Rym: But the other thing that's going on there is that the people who comment on GeekNights' videos in particular tend to be like 90% great.

574
00:36:41,932 --> 00:36:43,690
Rym: It's not just that there aren't bad people there.

575
00:36:44,191 --> 00:36:49,930
Scott: You're not gonna end up on how to win at Carcassonne as a recommended video next to a Nazi video.

576
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:53,510
Rym: We are definitely niche content when it comes to that.

577
00:36:54,112 --> 00:36:58,790
Scott: Yeah, if for some reason Nazis were into Carcassonne lately, we'd be in trouble.

578
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:07,259
Rym: Alright, I have posted all those things to you in the stream and now we're gonna continue with the show.

579
00:37:09,643 --> 00:37:10,940
Rym: Think of the day, think of the day, alright.

580
00:37:14,752 --> 00:37:16,749
Rym: So, can't believe we never talked about this.

581
00:37:17,993 --> 00:37:19,069
Scott: Or we did and you deleted it.

582
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:20,347
Rym: Oh yeah, of course I deleted it.

583
00:37:21,751 --> 00:37:26,470
Rym: So the next GeekNights' Monday we're gonna talk about web browsers, which was our first idea.

584
00:37:26,851 --> 00:37:37,870
Rym: But we realized in the old days, the Monday episodes of GeekNights, we would do these foundational series where we'd do a Monday and that would set the stage for the next Monday and the next Monday and the next Monday.

585
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:43,290
Rym: We'd be like, here's how binary math works, now we're gonna talk about transistors and we get up to computers.

586
00:37:44,511 --> 00:37:49,790
Rym: So, HTTP is one of the most important things in the modern world.

587
00:37:51,072 --> 00:37:51,774
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

588
00:37:51,995 --> 00:37:55,990
Scott: So I mean, it's just a protocol for computers to talk to each other.

589
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:58,110
Scott: It's a pretty high application level protocol.

590
00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:00,629
Scott: It's not like, you know, it's on top of TCP.

591
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:08,530
Scott: So it's like computers connect with TCP and using that connection that's already got so many layers underneath it of stuff going on, right?

592
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:16,810
Scott: You're then going to use the TCP connection to speak the HTTP protocol between two computers to exchange information, right?

593
00:38:17,191 --> 00:38:46,685
Scott: And this is an important protocol because not only is this how web browsers and web servers talk to each other using this protocol, but also because so many applications have been built upon the web, pretty much so many applications these days, even ones that aren't web browsers, are now speaking HTTP as a means of communicating with each other and avoiding having to code networking stuff, which sucks to code,

594
00:38:46,828 --> 00:38:46,930
Rym: right?

595
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:48,790
Rym: Yeah, like you hear people talk about web APIs.

596
00:38:49,791 --> 00:38:56,410
Rym: Like a lot of times, even like APIs will basically just act similar to how a web browser would work, hitting some random endpoint.

597
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:57,591
Scott: Right.

598
00:38:57,611 --> 00:39:03,930
Scott: It's like, you know, and maybe it's the late 90s, early 2000s, you want to make a video game that's like turn-based, right?

599
00:39:04,051 --> 00:39:05,338
Scott: And you want to have it be networked.

600
00:39:05,881 --> 00:39:06,444
Scott: So what do you do?

601
00:39:06,484 --> 00:39:07,590
Scott: You have to make a special server.

602
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:12,810
Scott: You have to come up with your own protocol, right, for how your game and the server are going to talk to each other, right?

603
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:14,797
Scott: You got to, you know, invent all this stuff.

604
00:39:16,162 --> 00:39:18,310
Scott: And that's what games did in those days, right?

605
00:39:18,631 --> 00:39:21,950
Scott: But now you can just be like, well, I'll just run a web server, right?

606
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:35,310
Scott: I'll run a web app, a web server, and then my video game that's running on someone's phone or on their switch or whatever is just going to make an HTTP connection to my web server and talk to it like it's a web page.

607
00:39:35,731 --> 00:39:43,007
Scott: And we'll use that to send high scores or whatever logins, you know, just do it all the web way because all that stuff is already cookie cutter.

608
00:39:43,608 --> 00:39:44,330
Scott: Save a bunch of effort.

609
00:39:44,971 --> 00:39:51,210
Scott: So it's important to know how the HTTP protocol works to understand how a lot of the Internet works.

610
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:53,896
Rym: And you don't even, it's not even complicated.

611
00:39:53,956 --> 00:39:59,650
Rym: Like we can pretty much explain the whole thing if we skip over like a few technical details.

612
00:40:00,332 --> 00:40:01,600
Rym: And it's also not even that old.

613
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,068
Rym: It is less than 30 years old.

614
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:04,469
Scott: Yeah, it's not that old.

615
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:07,395
Scott: It's literally the web, right?

616
00:40:07,596 --> 00:40:10,126
Scott: When someone says the web, they don't mean the whole Internet.

617
00:40:10,146 --> 00:40:11,250
Scott: The Internet's bigger than the web.

618
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:12,505
Rym: They mean the WWW.

619
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:14,433
Scott: Yes.

620
00:40:14,473 --> 00:40:20,510
Scott: The part of the Internet that is talking HTTP as opposed to talking any other protocol is the web.

621
00:40:20,952 --> 00:40:24,330
Scott: And the rest of the Internet that's not speaking in HTTP is not the web.

622
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:25,031
Rym: Yep.

623
00:40:25,071 --> 00:40:29,590
Rym: This is like Ted Nelson, Tim Berners-Lee Internet that we're talking about.

624
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:37,650
Scott: Even if you have part of the Internet that isn't talking HTTP, for example, an IRC server isn't talking HTTP.

625
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:41,106
Rym: Or if you're in a web browser, you type ftp colon slash slash.

626
00:40:41,146 --> 00:40:41,930
Rym: That's not HTTP.

627
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:43,331
Scott: Exactly.

628
00:40:44,093 --> 00:40:48,361
Scott: But people will make things like web-based IRC clients.

629
00:40:48,422 --> 00:40:52,350
Scott: And now you have, you're speaking HTTP and something is translating that to IRC.

630
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:54,861
Scott: And you're talking an IRC, right?

631
00:40:55,384 --> 00:40:56,128
Scott: So that's a thing.

632
00:40:56,771 --> 00:40:56,992
Rym: Yep.

633
00:40:57,333 --> 00:41:03,170
Rym: So HTTP, I think that the history lesson I do want to talk about, though, is what it actually stands for matters.

634
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:12,550
Rym: It is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, because it was designed to allow people to build hypertext interactions.

635
00:41:13,931 --> 00:41:16,477
Scott: The original design for the web, right?

636
00:41:16,778 --> 00:41:21,670
Scott: The original World Wide Web, it was HTTP and HTML, the two pieces, right?

637
00:41:22,071 --> 00:41:30,950
Scott: And the idea is that you have HTML, the Hypertext Markup Language, which is a way to make a document and a document with links in it.

638
00:41:31,553 --> 00:41:32,661
Scott: And you could click on the links.

639
00:41:32,701 --> 00:41:34,030
Scott: That would take you to other documents.

640
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:34,490
Rym: Yep.

641
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:36,498
Rym: You realize links were called hyperlinks.

642
00:41:36,578 --> 00:41:39,790
Rym: We call them links now because this history doesn't matter to most people anymore.

643
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:40,951
Scott: Right.

644
00:41:40,991 --> 00:41:44,057
Scott: And the idea of that having documents that link to each other.

645
00:41:44,438 --> 00:41:49,990
Scott: Well, if the documents link to each other, you need some protocol for requesting the other document.

646
00:41:50,171 --> 00:41:55,250
Scott: You have one document, you click on a link, you need to get the next document that you just clicked on the link for.

647
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:58,063
Scott: You can't download every document in the world to your computer at once.

648
00:41:58,103 --> 00:41:59,430
Scott: You need to do it one at a time.

649
00:42:00,291 --> 00:42:01,894
Scott: So HTTP and HTML go together.

650
00:42:01,914 --> 00:42:08,570
Scott: You have the web browser, which takes HTML and turns it into a document that you can read.

651
00:42:09,031 --> 00:42:18,710
Scott: But it also is speaking HTTP to web servers to get you more documents when you click on links or type in URLs into the browser.

652
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:20,533
Scott: And that's still basically how the web works.

653
00:42:21,315 --> 00:42:28,270
Scott: However, the original design for the web was such the web these days is pretty much read only.

654
00:42:28,852 --> 00:42:33,290
Scott: All of the writing is sort of done in not the original way that was intended.

655
00:42:33,911 --> 00:42:40,730
Scott: The original way that was intended is that, you know, you would be like post to a web page to create a new document.

656
00:42:41,271 --> 00:42:44,441
Scott: You would make a post HTTP call to create a document.

657
00:42:44,461 --> 00:42:47,450
Scott: You would make an update call to update a document in place.

658
00:42:47,933 --> 00:42:49,222
Scott: You would make a put document.

659
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:54,678
Rym: Imagine a world where Scott is running a web software.

660
00:42:54,698 --> 00:43:00,070
Rym: I'm not going to say web server or web browser because those kind of came later in a lot of ways.

661
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:01,595
Rym: So Scott's running a web thing.

662
00:43:01,736 --> 00:43:02,520
Rym: I'm running a web thing.

663
00:43:02,661 --> 00:43:03,445
Rym: I have some documents.

664
00:43:03,465 --> 00:43:04,330
Rym: Scott has some documents.

665
00:43:04,911 --> 00:43:09,910
Rym: I just send a request to Scott's thing to create a new document on his server and it just appears.

666
00:43:11,331 --> 00:43:13,690
Rym: And then I link to it from one of my documents.

667
00:43:14,412 --> 00:43:15,716
Scott: I'm on Rym's.

668
00:43:16,498 --> 00:43:18,384
Scott: I do a get to get a document from Rym.

669
00:43:18,424 --> 00:43:18,966
Scott: I'm reading it.

670
00:43:19,086 --> 00:43:20,350
Scott: I make some changes to it.

671
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:25,690
Scott: I send an update request via HTTP to Rym and his document updates.

672
00:43:26,571 --> 00:43:33,170
Rym: Imagine the world wide web as originally envisioned as literally every web browser is a web server and everything is Wikipedia.

673
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:34,550
Rym: Literally everything.

674
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:35,457
Scott: Pretty much.

675
00:43:35,477 --> 00:43:37,210
Scott: That was the original idea for the web.

676
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:41,830
Rym: Now it turns out spam and shitheads mean that doesn't work, but it was a noble idea.

677
00:43:42,893 --> 00:43:45,730
Scott: Yeah, it can work in certain cases, but it didn't work.

678
00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:51,010
Scott: So the way things actually happen is that most of the time when using the web you're making a get request.

679
00:43:52,131 --> 00:43:53,815
Scott: You make a TCP connection to a server.

680
00:43:54,056 --> 00:43:59,190
Scott: You send literally the letters "get" in ASCII, followed by some path.

681
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:00,532
Scott: Like get index.html.

682
00:44:00,552 --> 00:44:01,394
Scott: Get /geeknights/2020-1109/something.mp3.

683
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:10,615
Scott: It's real simple.

684
00:44:10,696 --> 00:44:14,910
Rym: You can do a packet capture and understand web traffic with your human eyeballs.

685
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:23,110
Scott: Yeah, you can just open up your terminal and type telnet space google.com and then type get forward slash and the HTML of google.com will just appear.

686
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:25,748
Rym: And if you do that on a simple website, you can probably read it.

687
00:44:26,891 --> 00:44:28,193
Scott: Yeah.

688
00:44:28,634 --> 00:44:31,659
Scott: So that's what happens.

689
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:37,670
Scott: You send a get request and the web server sends back the document or whatever it is at that URL.

690
00:44:38,332 --> 00:44:39,716
Scott: And then it's up to you.

691
00:44:39,836 --> 00:44:41,883
Scott: You've now received that document.

692
00:44:41,983 --> 00:44:44,110
Scott: It's up to your computer to decide what to do with it.

693
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:47,823
Scott: If there includes JavaScript, maybe your web browser will run the JavaScript.

694
00:44:47,863 --> 00:44:48,364
Scott: Maybe not.

695
00:44:48,385 --> 00:44:49,047
Scott: Maybe some of it.

696
00:44:49,087 --> 00:44:49,950
Scott: Maybe not some of it.

697
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:50,773
Scott: There's HTML.

698
00:44:51,094 --> 00:44:51,857
Scott: It's going to render it.

699
00:44:51,897 --> 00:44:52,780
Scott: How's it going to render it?

700
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,510
Scott: There's instructions on how they would like you to render it, but it's up to you.

701
00:44:55,790 --> 00:44:58,909
Scott: They sent you documents and what you do with them is now up to you.

702
00:44:59,852 --> 00:45:08,730
Scott: And when you post these days, you're still sending data to the server, but the server isn't updating the document at the URL that you posted to.

703
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:20,550
Scott: It's, you know, probably performing some, you know, validation and computation and putting that data into a database and using that data in the database to then render and automatically generate documents.

704
00:45:21,351 --> 00:45:22,052
Rym: Well, same with gets.

705
00:45:22,092 --> 00:45:27,461
Rym: When you get, you very rarely get back like a file or a document that is stored somewhere.

706
00:45:27,721 --> 00:45:33,110
Rym: You get back a dynamically created file at like created at the time you made the request.

707
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:35,990
Rym: Your request caused it to exist just for you in that moment.

708
00:45:36,811 --> 00:45:37,813
Scott: Or at least part of it, right?

709
00:45:37,853 --> 00:45:39,476
Scott: You make a get to Reddit.com.

710
00:45:39,516 --> 00:45:41,240
Scott: They load a Reddit homepage.

711
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:42,623
Scott: that's your Reddit homepage.

712
00:45:42,703 --> 00:45:45,890
Scott: You know, you make a Google search, they create a Google search result.

713
00:45:46,251 --> 00:45:58,450
Scott: That's not, you know, it might be a global Google search result if you were like using private browsing or something, but it's probably a Google search result customized for you that the server generated, you know, ran some code when it got that request.

714
00:45:58,811 --> 00:46:04,890
Scott: And then the code created an HTML document to send back to you that wasn't just sitting on the server waiting.

715
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:15,110
Scott: Although there are many static websites still out there, which literally are just a bunch of files and you request them and you get the files as they are on the disk and no computation is really happening.

716
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:31,470
Rym: One way why this was very important and different from how things were done previously, like you look at how Gopher and things work, like other methods to share documents or information was that, like Scott pointed out, it's sort of this two way thing, but it's also hyper generic, as we discussed.

717
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:43,890
Rym: But the third way it's really important is or the third thing that's interesting about it is that it is completely stateless in that once you complete a transaction, it doesn't matter that you have completed that transaction.

718
00:46:43,991 --> 00:46:46,089
Rym: The server doesn't know that it was you that did shit.

719
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:47,670
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

720
00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:51,450
Scott: So if I make a post right with my username and password.

721
00:46:52,273 --> 00:46:52,557
Scott: Right.

722
00:46:52,861 --> 00:46:53,449
Scott: OK, well, OK.

723
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:56,610
Scott: And then the server sends a response and then that's it.

724
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:57,099
Scott: We're done.

725
00:46:57,406 --> 00:46:57,590
Scott: Right.

726
00:46:57,890 --> 00:46:58,573
Scott: It can't it doesn't.

727
00:46:58,914 --> 00:47:03,290
Scott: if I then send another request like, OK, you know, get me my user profile.

728
00:47:04,872 --> 00:47:07,870
Scott: It doesn't remember anything about the previous request at all.

729
00:47:07,951 --> 00:47:08,989
Scott: It's a brand new request.

730
00:47:09,632 --> 00:47:12,369
Scott: So how the hell does it know that I'm logged in, not logged in?

731
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:14,430
Scott: How how is the state happening?

732
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:14,810
Scott: Right.

733
00:47:14,831 --> 00:47:18,870
Scott: There's every single request is brand new from the void.

734
00:47:19,212 --> 00:47:21,429
Scott: Doesn't know anything about what happened in the past.

735
00:47:22,054 --> 00:47:23,549
Scott: How do we carry the state over?

736
00:47:24,092 --> 00:47:24,654
Scott: And that's we.

737
00:47:24,834 --> 00:47:29,330
Scott: there's extra features that are built on top, which is basically cookies and headers.

738
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:37,510
Rym: Yeah, that's where like a lot of these things came from, because the protocol is so simple that it doesn't actually do very much.

739
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:43,970
Rym: And 90 percent of the logic you see in any web interaction is at a layer above HTTP effectively.

740
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:56,470
Rym: Like example, JavaScript, JavaScript, the data transfer, like, you know, a lot of URLs have like a bunch of random gibberish at the end and a bunch of like like that is your request in many cases directly.

741
00:47:57,450 --> 00:47:57,571
Scott: Yeah.

742
00:47:57,591 --> 00:48:00,210
Scott: New kinds of files, CSS files that were invented.

743
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:08,630
Rym: In fact, early HTTP actually initiated a complete TCP connection for each request and then terminated that connection after the response came back.

744
00:48:09,132 --> 00:48:12,050
Rym: They added the idea of a keep alive later.

745
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:13,411
Scott: Yep.

746
00:48:13,451 --> 00:48:18,170
Scott: And now they've got newer things like HTTP three slash quick web sockets.

747
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:19,352
Rym: That just came out.

748
00:48:19,373 --> 00:48:20,075
Rym: That is like 2017, 2018.

749
00:48:20,075 --> 00:48:21,220
Rym: Like that is brand new.

750
00:48:23,851 --> 00:48:24,132
Scott: It's not.

751
00:48:24,152 --> 00:48:24,734
Scott: it's not.

752
00:48:24,794 --> 00:48:26,059
Scott: it didn't literally just came out.

753
00:48:26,099 --> 00:48:28,187
Scott: But in terms of the scope of the entire web.

754
00:48:28,227 --> 00:48:29,050
Scott: Yeah, it just came out.

755
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:29,311
Scott: Yeah.

756
00:48:29,551 --> 00:48:32,600
Rym: In terms of like being used widely to actually check this out.

757
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:35,770
Scott: Web sockets are the WebSockets is like how Jackbox works.

758
00:48:36,271 --> 00:48:36,411
Rym: Yeah.

759
00:48:36,411 --> 00:48:40,711
Rym: 2015, 2.0, 2018, 3.0.

760
00:48:40,711 --> 00:48:40,872
Scott: Yep.

761
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:44,090
Scott: So, yeah, let's talk about the HTTP headers for a bit.

762
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:45,473
Scott: So the HTTP headers are.

763
00:48:45,653 --> 00:48:52,850
Scott: is, you know, if you're just opening up your terminal and typing get forward slash, you know, it's like, well, that's all you're sending to the to the server.

764
00:48:52,910 --> 00:48:57,363
Scott: But your web browser is sending a lot more information besides.

765
00:48:57,444 --> 00:48:59,610
Scott: just get and the URL.

766
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:00,191
Scott: Right.

767
00:49:00,471 --> 00:49:03,979
Scott: It's sending all of this extra stuff like here's my user agent.

768
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:09,330
Scott: Here's, you know, the the kind of format I would I want to get from you.

769
00:49:09,510 --> 00:49:12,280
Scott: I want to get this kind of content, you know.

770
00:49:12,501 --> 00:49:14,910
Scott: Oh, and here, you know, I also here's a bunch of cookies.

771
00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:18,690
Scott: Here's the things that I remember about the last time I visited this website.

772
00:49:19,091 --> 00:49:24,090
Scott: And, you know, just all this that your browser sends a lot of extra just meta information.

773
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:25,635
Scott: Oh, yeah, I'm visiting you.

774
00:49:26,217 --> 00:49:30,290
Scott: And the reason I'm visiting you is because my user clicked the link on this other site.

775
00:49:30,350 --> 00:49:30,491
Scott: Right.

776
00:49:30,531 --> 00:49:32,481
Scott: Someone clicked a link on front row crew dot com.

777
00:49:33,024 --> 00:49:34,110
Scott: I know that you're Google dot com.

778
00:49:34,190 --> 00:49:35,909
Scott: I'm just telling you this is who sent me here.

779
00:49:36,391 --> 00:49:36,572
Scott: Right.

780
00:49:36,853 --> 00:49:40,769
Scott: It's just your browser just sends all this extra stuff and all that extra stuff.

781
00:49:41,251 --> 00:49:47,450
Scott: The Web servers can now use that extra stuff and often do to make a decision about what to send.

782
00:49:47,951 --> 00:49:48,112
Scott: Right.

783
00:49:48,152 --> 00:49:51,220
Scott: It's like, oh, you're using IE, I see.

784
00:49:51,241 --> 00:49:54,530
Scott: I will send you different HTML so that it renders properly.

785
00:49:54,931 --> 00:49:59,486
Scott: Oh, I see that you have included a cookie that you have saved that cookie.

786
00:49:59,546 --> 00:50:00,770
Scott: Let me check my database here.

787
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:01,031
Scott: Yep.

788
00:50:01,091 --> 00:50:03,690
Scott: That is a cookie belonging to a valid logged in user.

789
00:50:04,131 --> 00:50:08,810
Scott: So instead of sending you a login page, I'm going to send you, you know, the settings page.

790
00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:12,510
Rym: Some of them are setting and just not like they don't mean anything anymore.

791
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:13,813
Rym: Like no one ever sends them.

792
00:50:14,194 --> 00:50:20,450
Rym: Some of them have been sort of appropriated to do something different from what they originally intended just by consensus.

793
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:24,130
Rym: Some of them are used, a lot of them are actually used for performance reasons.

794
00:50:24,510 --> 00:50:26,780
Rym: Like even in the early days, there's one.

795
00:50:27,544 --> 00:50:28,146
Rym: I pulled up the list.

796
00:50:28,166 --> 00:50:28,829
Rym: I was looking for it.

797
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:32,530
Rym: If on modified since, like that's an example that actually makes sense.

798
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:33,273
Scott: People use that.

799
00:50:33,293 --> 00:50:33,454
Scott: Yeah.

800
00:50:33,756 --> 00:50:36,110
Scott: A lot of them control things like caching, you know.

801
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:36,491
Rym: Yeah.

802
00:50:36,511 --> 00:50:38,354
Rym: But here's this example actually makes sense.

803
00:50:38,434 --> 00:50:47,590
Rym: If on modified since basically says only send the response if the entity I'm requesting has not been modified since some previous time.

804
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:55,628
Rym: So I might send a get that says if unmodified since some date and Scott's web server just wouldn't respond.

805
00:50:55,728 --> 00:50:56,350
Rym: And then I know.

806
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:57,234
Scott: Well, it responds.

807
00:50:57,294 --> 00:51:00,190
Scott: It sounds like there's like a code for it, but it's like two oh something.

808
00:51:00,291 --> 00:51:00,654
Scott: And it's just.

809
00:51:00,835 --> 00:51:02,690
Scott: there won't be any actual data in the response.

810
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:03,899
Rym: I only get a header back.

811
00:51:03,939 --> 00:51:05,150
Rym: I don't get the payload.

812
00:51:05,991 --> 00:51:06,172
Scott: Right.

813
00:51:06,212 --> 00:51:06,674
Scott: Exactly.

814
00:51:06,734 --> 00:51:07,497
Rym: But I know.

815
00:51:07,537 --> 00:51:07,758
Rym: Yeah.

816
00:51:07,979 --> 00:51:08,642
Scott: Nothing's changed.

817
00:51:08,662 --> 00:51:09,887
Scott: You don't need to reload your page.

818
00:51:09,947 --> 00:51:10,529
Scott: Just stay where you are.

819
00:51:10,770 --> 00:51:10,930
Rym: Yep.

820
00:51:11,011 --> 00:51:11,913
Rym: So thus, Scott does.

821
00:51:11,973 --> 00:51:18,970
Rym: I don't know if I keep that five in virtually through my system, but I'm using this if unmodified since Scott doesn't keep sending me the payload.

822
00:51:19,370 --> 00:51:19,470
Scott: Right.

823
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:21,615
Scott: You're on the night's home page and you keep reloading.

824
00:51:21,876 --> 00:51:22,056
Scott: Right.

825
00:51:22,097 --> 00:51:27,670
Scott: Well, your browser is still making requests and getting tiny, tiny responses, but it's not actually reloading the page.

826
00:51:27,851 --> 00:51:28,071
Scott: Yeah.

827
00:51:28,132 --> 00:51:29,437
Scott: Then we upload this episode.

828
00:51:29,577 --> 00:51:32,950
Scott: Suddenly you're going to get a real response and then you keep reloading.

829
00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:34,941
Scott: And then after that, you're not getting real responses anymore.

830
00:51:34,961 --> 00:51:36,449
Scott: You're just getting the tiny response again.

831
00:51:37,792 --> 00:51:37,953
Scott: Right.

832
00:51:38,033 --> 00:51:44,050
Scott: But yeah, all these headers, like you can send, you can put any header you want with any name and put any content in those headers that you want.

833
00:51:44,531 --> 00:51:50,849
Scott: But it's just that we've come to agree over time, you know, between browser makers and web server makers.

834
00:51:51,189 --> 00:51:51,370
Scott: Right.

835
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:59,450
Scott: Well, these headers are going to have sort of codified behaviors and we're just sort of going to agree among us that this is what they'll mean.

836
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:03,579
Scott: And this is what you should do if you see them and you see these values in them.

837
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:08,850
Scott: And it's just sort of like these, you know, codes and rules you've come up with because you can make a header of anything.

838
00:52:09,351 --> 00:52:09,831
Scott: So it's just.

839
00:52:09,912 --> 00:52:12,055
Scott: it's just up to, you know, the community.

840
00:52:12,075 --> 00:52:12,756
Scott: Right.

841
00:52:12,816 --> 00:52:20,690
Scott: And various consortiums of people working together to agree that we'll do if these headers mean this, do things this way.

842
00:52:21,291 --> 00:52:24,059
Scott: And if you follow those rules, things will function properly.

843
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:28,090
Scott: And if you decide to do it a different way, things might function not as users expect.

844
00:52:28,411 --> 00:52:28,691
Rym: Yep.

845
00:52:29,132 --> 00:52:37,068
Scott: And sometimes you can always intentionally not do or do extra things based on what you see when you're talking in HTTP.

846
00:52:37,108 --> 00:52:37,950
Scott: And that's up to you.

847
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:48,230
Rym: Like, for example, I might my server might say, oh, if the user agent string is foo, I know that that browser is broken and I'm going to serve different HTML to prevent there from being a problem.

848
00:52:48,551 --> 00:52:49,973
Rym: But there's no standard around that.

849
00:52:50,334 --> 00:52:57,608
Scott: So on my Web browser might say, well, if you see any, you know, HTML that looks like this, that's an ad.

850
00:52:57,648 --> 00:52:58,330
Scott: So don't do this.

851
00:52:58,630 --> 00:52:59,111
Rym: Yep.

852
00:52:59,432 --> 00:53:08,530
Rym: Because the big the way HTTP is used and the way HTML are used is that it's just a way to transfer basically these documents back and forth.

853
00:53:08,951 --> 00:53:14,110
Rym: But it doesn't say none of this says anything about what to do with that data once you get it, because it's completely stateless.

854
00:53:15,191 --> 00:53:15,351
Scott: Yep.

855
00:53:17,597 --> 00:53:22,910
Scott: So, yeah, that's you know, if you really want to see the exact details about HTTP works, it's really not that scary.

856
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:27,940
Scott: If you just Google for like if you use HTTP to Google for how does HTTP work?

857
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:29,723
Scott: or what HTTP packets look like?

858
00:53:29,823 --> 00:53:33,190
Scott: or, you know, what HTTP headers looks like and how they're formatted.

859
00:53:33,651 --> 00:53:34,858
Scott: It's very straightforward.

860
00:53:34,918 --> 00:53:36,950
Scott: You can understand it even if you don't understand anything else.

861
00:53:36,970 --> 00:53:41,604
Scott: And all you got to know is that Web browser sends one and then the Web server sends one back.

862
00:53:41,725 --> 00:53:43,390
Scott: And that's pretty much all there is to it.

863
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:46,850
Rym: There's only nine methods and most of them are never used.

864
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:49,502
Scott: Some of them are used these days.

865
00:53:49,522 --> 00:53:50,288
Scott: They're still all available.

866
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:54,990
Rym: There's things that are used for weird reasons today that were never used for their original purpose.

867
00:53:55,990 --> 00:53:56,091
Scott: Yes.

868
00:53:56,131 --> 00:53:58,739
Scott: I think the original purpose was to use all nine.

869
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:02,550
Scott: The hypertext world we were discussing, the Wikipedia world, right?

870
00:54:03,011 --> 00:54:04,073
Scott: That never came to be.

871
00:54:04,154 --> 00:54:10,070
Scott: So what happened is for many, many years, people were literally just using get and post mostly and really not using the other ones very much at all.

872
00:54:10,070 --> 00:54:14,670
Rym: The head was used a lot for performance reasons before we had was used for debugging.

873
00:54:14,871 --> 00:54:21,010
Scott: You know, you just want to see the headers, things like that, you know, things that normal people wouldn't be like delete patch.

874
00:54:21,490 --> 00:54:22,231
Rym: But like that.

875
00:54:23,113 --> 00:54:23,254
Scott: Right.

876
00:54:23,314 --> 00:54:31,350
Scott: But nowadays, with the advent of like restful APIs, though, because those functions still exist and the code for them was still there, just slumbering.

877
00:54:31,771 --> 00:54:38,510
Scott: People took advantage of those extra functions and have now used them to develop various APIs for different applications.

878
00:54:39,892 --> 00:54:46,610
Scott: And so those are now being used in various ways, especially restful APIs, not so much other kinds of APIs.

879
00:54:47,891 --> 00:54:50,910
Scott: But they're still heavily underused compared to get and post.

880
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:53,009
Scott: It's pretty much just if you can get and post, you're good.

881
00:54:53,490 --> 00:55:02,210
Rym: And people misuse them like in the original specs, like get was one of the functions, one of the methods that is defined as it should not change anything.

882
00:55:02,290 --> 00:55:06,270
Rym: You should be able to call this as many times as you want and nothing will ever change.

883
00:55:06,691 --> 00:55:12,110
Rym: But I know there are definitely applications out there that will change their own state based on a get request.

884
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:17,450
Scott: Yes, that is because they're mostly that happens because of query parameters.

885
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:24,009
Scott: You make a URL and at the end of the URL, you put question mark A equals B, X equals hello.

886
00:55:24,109 --> 00:55:24,330
Scott: Right.

887
00:55:24,490 --> 00:55:31,770
Scott: And what happens is when the Web server receives that, they remove that part from the end of the URL and they break that into parameters.

888
00:55:32,051 --> 00:55:38,710
Scott: And now whatever program is running on the Web server is free to interpret those parameters as it wishes, and it might do instructions.

889
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:40,970
Scott: So the most common use would be like for a search query.

890
00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:44,858
Scott: Yeah, it'll be like, you know, you go to front record dot com slash search slash.

891
00:55:44,919 --> 00:55:49,650
Scott: question mark Q equals water in the ceiling.

892
00:55:49,951 --> 00:55:53,162
Scott: And now you're searching for the episode about water in the ceiling.

893
00:55:53,222 --> 00:55:53,443
Scott: Right.

894
00:55:54,868 --> 00:55:55,430
Scott: Stuff like that.

895
00:55:55,730 --> 00:56:00,409
Scott: But most of the time you'll be doing for stuff like that, you'll be doing a post.

896
00:56:00,911 --> 00:56:10,050
Scott: And the same exact query parameters that when you do a post, those same as a query parameters that would be would be in the URL are now in the body of the post.

897
00:56:10,511 --> 00:56:15,790
Scott: You can't visually see them in the browser, but they're basically just in a different part of the HDV packet.

898
00:56:15,970 --> 00:56:16,532
Scott: They're still there.

899
00:56:16,573 --> 00:56:17,537
Scott: They're still the same format.

900
00:56:19,063 --> 00:56:20,590
Scott: And the Web server will interpret those.

901
00:56:21,051 --> 00:56:24,803
Scott: And that's considered to just be a better idea to not mess up someone's URL bar.

902
00:56:25,044 --> 00:56:25,265
Scott: Yeah.

903
00:56:25,746 --> 00:56:26,950
Scott: And to use the correct command.

904
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:27,972
Rym: It is definitely like.

905
00:56:28,032 --> 00:56:37,350
Rym: it's kind of like when you see a Web site that has like really, really, really ugly overloaded URLs, like it's a sign that maybe it's not the most sophisticated system.

906
00:56:37,971 --> 00:56:38,111
Scott: Yeah.

907
00:56:38,131 --> 00:56:38,953
Scott: There's other issues.

908
00:56:38,994 --> 00:56:42,022
Scott: For example, let's say you're going to a form to purchase something.

909
00:56:42,062 --> 00:56:42,203
Scott: Right.

910
00:56:42,223 --> 00:56:44,409
Scott: The Web was never intended originally for commerce.

911
00:56:44,469 --> 00:56:44,650
Scott: Right.

912
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:45,111
Rym: Yeah.

913
00:56:45,132 --> 00:56:46,890
Rym: Like most of these functions are supposed to be idempotent.

914
00:56:47,870 --> 00:56:48,111
Scott: Yeah.

915
00:56:48,332 --> 00:56:51,161
Scott: You go to fill out your credit card information and your address and everything.

916
00:56:51,522 --> 00:56:54,230
Scott: If you put that in the URL, which will totally work, by the way.

917
00:56:55,431 --> 00:57:08,010
Scott: If someone writes their web, their eShop that way, their e-commerce platform that way, then now not only is that URL being sent over the Internet, like sort of unencrypted, I guess if using HTTPS.

918
00:57:08,890 --> 00:57:10,854
Scott: We'll talk about HTTPS, I guess, finally at the end.

919
00:57:10,875 --> 00:57:11,897
Scott: Yeah.

920
00:57:12,999 --> 00:57:17,149
Scott: It's still going to be like in your browser history, your credit card number just hanging out there.

921
00:57:17,169 --> 00:57:17,630
Scott: Right.

922
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:18,371
Scott: That's not great.

923
00:57:19,613 --> 00:57:22,959
Scott: So you want to put it in the post body when you fill out forms on the Web.

924
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:23,360
Scott: It's in.

925
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:24,301
Scott: That's a post.

926
00:57:24,522 --> 00:57:24,662
Scott: Right.

927
00:57:24,682 --> 00:57:28,248
Scott: You push the save button, the submit button, you know, the add to cart.

928
00:57:28,408 --> 00:57:28,629
Scott: Right.

929
00:57:28,769 --> 00:57:29,490
Scott: Check out button.

930
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:39,030
Scott: That's making a post request and sending all the information in the form to the server for processing in a not visible, you know, better way.

931
00:57:39,531 --> 00:57:47,010
Scott: If you ever see your credit card information, your username, your password in the URL bar, change that password to something else and get the hell off that.

932
00:57:47,070 --> 00:57:51,379
Scott: And if you're using that password anywhere else that you shouldn't be, change it and get the hell off that website.

933
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:53,985
Rym: I have never seen that except on malware sites.

934
00:57:54,045 --> 00:57:56,470
Rym: I was poking at to see what the malware was going to do.

935
00:57:56,850 --> 00:57:58,254
Scott: I've seen it back in the olden days.

936
00:57:58,334 --> 00:57:59,677
Rym: In the old days, I saw it a lot.

937
00:58:00,058 --> 00:58:03,807
Scott: The extreme olden days, extreme olden days, late 90s.

938
00:58:03,847 --> 00:58:04,870
Rym: Not common these days.

939
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:07,154
Rym: So I guess the last piece.

940
00:58:07,214 --> 00:58:09,278
Rym: Notice there's no log in, log off, any of that.

941
00:58:09,298 --> 00:58:10,520
Rym: That's all handled by applications.

942
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:16,510
Rym: There's also no encryption or security of any kind in anything we've said so far.

943
00:58:18,011 --> 00:58:19,052
Scott: Nothing.

944
00:58:19,513 --> 00:58:19,833
Scott: Nada.

945
00:58:19,873 --> 00:58:33,890
Scott: So if you have access to a network and you can, you know, read the packets on that network because it's your router or something, you can see all the HTTP traffic going back and forth and you can see, oh, this person visited this website and this is what came back.

946
00:58:34,691 --> 00:58:36,353
Rym: They typed this password.

947
00:58:37,315 --> 00:58:41,660
Scott: This is the kind of porn they like.

948
00:58:42,161 --> 00:58:48,590
Scott: And since HTTP is so easy to understand, you can just read it with your eyeballs pretty much and understand what's happening.

949
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:51,617
Rym: I have done this troubleshooting problems in my life.

950
00:58:52,239 --> 00:58:55,970
Scott: And if you use software to make it even easier to read, well, now you can really see everything.

951
00:58:56,251 --> 00:59:05,050
Rym: So HTTPS is basically the way to wrap this whole exchange in an encrypted channel, basically.

952
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:14,664
Scott: So what happens is before you start talking in HTTP, you make an encrypted connection with the web server.

953
00:59:16,126 --> 00:59:18,510
Scott: And there's a whole schmageggy that goes on here.

954
00:59:19,151 --> 00:59:21,797
Rym: It used to be SSL.

955
00:59:22,118 --> 00:59:22,979
Rym: It's TLS now.

956
00:59:22,999 --> 00:59:27,930
Rym: And TLS, the exchange that happens, is actually very complicated.

957
00:59:28,970 --> 00:59:29,492
Scott: Yes.

958
00:59:29,873 --> 00:59:36,150
Scott: But what you have to know is the important part for users to understand is the certificate signing issue, right?

959
00:59:36,690 --> 00:59:41,560
Scott: So there in the world, there exists the certificate signing authorities, right?

960
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:42,222
Scott: CSA.

961
00:59:42,382 --> 00:59:43,264
Scott: You might have heard of these.

962
00:59:43,565 --> 00:59:46,150
Scott: Verisign is a big one, like maybe the biggest one.

963
00:59:46,190 --> 00:59:48,117
Scott: But there's others, some small, some big.

964
00:59:48,439 --> 00:59:51,350
Scott: Let's Encrypt is like the hot one, which you should probably be using.

965
00:59:52,531 --> 00:59:55,900
Scott: And what they do is they're basically saying, look, we're a certificate signing authority.

966
00:59:56,421 --> 00:59:57,725
Scott: You trust us, right?

967
00:59:58,026 --> 00:59:59,610
Scott: We're basically a house of trust.

968
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:00,832
Scott: That's all they exist for.

969
01:00:01,374 --> 01:00:09,450
Scott: And what they do is they verify that their customers who are coming, who own websites, who run websites, are who they say they are.

970
01:00:09,550 --> 01:00:14,845
Scott: So if I have a website and I want my website to be secure, I go and I say, hey, hey, hey, trust house.

971
01:00:14,905 --> 01:00:15,707
Scott: No one trusts me.

972
01:00:15,728 --> 01:00:16,570
Scott: I'm just Scott.

973
01:00:17,570 --> 01:00:20,395
Scott: They trust you, though, because you're a giant organization.

974
01:00:20,415 --> 01:00:24,722
Scott: I want you to tell everyone that I'm trustworthy.

975
01:00:24,762 --> 01:00:27,026
Scott: And they say, oh, well, we're going to have to come and investigate.

976
01:00:27,106 --> 01:00:28,228
Scott: Are you trustworthy, right?

977
01:00:28,328 --> 01:00:29,610
Scott: Are you who you say you are?

978
01:00:30,271 --> 01:00:32,994
Scott: And then they say, OK, we talked to Scott.

979
01:00:33,014 --> 01:00:33,695
Scott: We figured it out.

980
01:00:33,735 --> 01:00:35,037
Scott: Scott is who they say they are.

981
01:00:35,077 --> 01:00:44,570
Scott: This Web server is definitely owned by the person who at this domain is definitely the person who just came asking us to sign their certificate.

982
01:00:45,291 --> 01:00:47,518
Scott: So I make a cryptographic set of keys.

983
01:00:47,959 --> 01:00:51,530
Scott: They basically put a rubber stamp on my cryptographic set of keys.

984
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:58,959
Scott: And then I now have a number, literally a number, in a file on my Web server.

985
01:00:59,019 --> 01:01:08,470
Scott: And that number mathematically proves with cryptographic levels of no doubt that the trust group has said that I am trustworthy.

986
01:01:09,090 --> 01:01:21,250
Scott: So then when you come to our website, before we start webbing and you start sending me your name and password and stuff, we send back, we do a little math between each other to arrange for some cryptographic keys between us.

987
01:01:21,691 --> 01:01:30,670
Scott: And because I have that cert from the trust house and your Web browser also has a cert from the trust house baked into it, your OS probably has some baked in as well.

988
01:01:30,810 --> 01:01:32,975
Scott: I know Windows has a huge list of them.

989
01:01:33,456 --> 01:01:36,403
Scott: Your computer trusts that group.

990
01:01:37,024 --> 01:01:37,967
Scott: That group trusts me.

991
01:01:38,147 --> 01:01:39,310
Scott: Now your computer trusts me.

992
01:01:39,931 --> 01:01:40,893
Scott: Now you verify.

993
01:01:41,153 --> 01:01:46,846
Scott: you basically assume that I am who I say I was and not an imposter trying to set up like chase dot com.

994
01:01:46,886 --> 01:01:48,750
Scott: That is not actually chase dot com.

995
01:01:48,790 --> 01:01:50,190
Rym: Yeah, but it's just our friend Chase.

996
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:51,912
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

997
01:01:51,952 --> 01:01:56,969
Scott: I didn't make a fake Chase Bank Web site, you know, to try to trick you into typing your bank password into something.

998
01:01:57,029 --> 01:01:57,190
Scott: Right.

999
01:01:58,671 --> 01:02:06,790
Scott: And then you now know the top left of your browser where that little lock icon is, is going to be locked and not unlocked or red or have a skull and crossbones.

1000
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:07,750
Scott: And you've ever clicked on that thing.

1001
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:09,009
Scott: It's going to be nice and green and happy.

1002
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:11,755
Rym: And you keep clicking until it shows you the details.

1003
01:02:11,775 --> 01:02:17,870
Rym: You can actually see like the details of that certificate, who signed it, when they signed it, how strong it is, everything.

1004
01:02:18,532 --> 01:02:18,732
Scott: Right.

1005
01:02:18,753 --> 01:02:20,096
Scott: So it serves these two purposes.

1006
01:02:20,357 --> 01:02:23,747
Scott: One, the Web site you're visiting is the Web site you think you're visiting.

1007
01:02:23,907 --> 01:02:24,870
Scott: It's not an imposter.

1008
01:02:25,630 --> 01:02:25,730
Scott: Right.

1009
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:38,510
Scott: And two, now that you trust them, you you do a key exchange and you create a temporary set of symmetric keys with which to encrypt all of the HTTP that you are now going to speak at each other.

1010
01:02:38,830 --> 01:02:55,388
Scott: So if anyone on the rest of the Internet decides to try to look at what your conversation is, try to look at the credit card you're sending to Amazon, try to see the password you're sending to the forum or discord or whatever, you know, your secret messages to your lover, whatever that will be encrypted and no one will be able to read it.

1011
01:02:56,429 --> 01:02:56,890
Scott: Tough cookies.

1012
01:02:56,950 --> 01:02:57,131
Scott: Yep.

1013
01:02:57,191 --> 01:02:58,895
Rym: It's beyond the scope of this show.

1014
01:02:58,996 --> 01:03:04,310
Rym: But as of now, the way this is done is is secure at the time of the transaction.

1015
01:03:05,110 --> 01:03:13,230
Scott: And if you're using the newest correct ways and everything is set up properly and your browser is not been tampered with and there's so many caveats.

1016
01:03:13,690 --> 01:03:18,310
Scott: But if you, you know, under normal circumstances, you're good if you see the green light.

1017
01:03:18,370 --> 01:03:18,570
Scott: Yeah.

1018
01:03:18,631 --> 01:03:30,130
Rym: Modern TLS is incredibly powerful and it's complex to the point that I cannot explain the full handshake without referencing a guide because it's actually way more complicated than SSL was.

1019
01:03:30,490 --> 01:03:32,450
Scott: If you want to learn that, YouTube videos.

1020
01:03:32,690 --> 01:03:35,190
Rym: If you want to learn that, there will be a job for you forever.

1021
01:03:41,620 --> 01:03:43,720
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1022
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:48,840
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1023
01:03:49,221 --> 01:03:54,260
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

1024
01:03:54,860 --> 01:03:57,207
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1025
01:03:57,347 --> 01:04:01,920
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1026
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:05,456
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1027
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:09,790
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1028
01:04:09,991 --> 01:04:12,880
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1029
01:04:13,321 --> 01:04:21,500
Rym: And the Patreon Patrons for this episode of GeekNights are Alan Joyce, Heidi McNichol, Marty Greenia, Graham Finch, you hold the key to my heart.

1030
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:24,484
Rym: I pulled up to the house about seven or eight.

1031
01:04:24,844 --> 01:04:35,680
Rym: Clinton Walton, Ren from New Zealand, Ryan Perry, Chris Midgiff, Dread, Lily Tenebrae, just like a dude guy, Chris Reimer, Finn, Chirping Ron Horrell and a bunch of people who do not want me to say their names.

1032
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:38,211
Rym: And now, I leave you with...

1033
01:04:41,791 --> 01:04:42,694
Scott: Celebrity Jeopardy.

1034
01:04:43,095 --> 01:04:45,583
Scott: We've got three wonderful celebrities playing for charity.

1035
01:04:45,904 --> 01:04:46,465
Scott: Let's meet them.

1036
01:04:47,128 --> 01:04:47,890
Scott: Sean Connery.

1037
01:04:50,112 --> 01:04:50,393
Scott: Hello.

1038
01:04:52,563 --> 01:04:52,824
Scott: Mr.

1039
01:04:52,864 --> 01:04:54,110
Scott: Connery, it's your turn.

1040
01:04:55,915 --> 01:04:58,870
Rym: I'll take movies for 400.

1041
01:04:58,870 --> 01:05:03,523
Rym: The answer is John Travolta learned how to dance for this 1977 hit movie.

1042
01:05:03,543 --> 01:05:03,583
Rym: Mr.

1043
01:05:03,643 --> 01:05:03,964
Rym: Connery.

1044
01:05:06,670 --> 01:05:07,909
Rym: That would be George.

1045
01:05:09,627 --> 01:05:09,709
Rym: No.

1046
01:05:11,150 --> 01:05:12,434
Rym: Jaws is incorrect.

1047
01:05:13,477 --> 01:05:16,045
Scott: And please answer in the form of a question.

1048
01:05:16,225 --> 01:05:17,730
Rym: Sean Connery, it's still your board.

1049
01:05:19,675 --> 01:05:22,691
Rym: I'll take swords for 400.

1050
01:05:22,691 --> 01:05:24,369
Scott: It's actually not swords.

1051
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:27,470
Scott: Swords.

1052
01:05:29,713 --> 01:05:38,529
Scott: These are words that begin with S. The answer is Popeye is this sort of man.

1053
01:05:40,611 --> 01:05:40,844
Scott: Sabre.

1054
01:05:41,192 --> 01:05:41,237
Scott: No.

1055
01:05:42,650 --> 01:05:47,182
Scott: It began with a bloody S. All three celebrities are $800 down.

1056
01:05:48,890 --> 01:05:53,810
Scott: The hell if I'm going to pay you a bloody $800.

1057
01:05:53,810 --> 01:05:55,135
Scott: Please rest assured, Mr.

1058
01:05:55,155 --> 01:05:56,419
Scott: Connery, this is for charity.

1059
01:05:56,540 --> 01:05:57,644
Scott: It's not your own money.

1060
01:05:58,306 --> 01:05:59,490
Scott: And it is still your board.

1061
01:06:00,755 --> 01:06:03,170
Scott: I'll take movies for 200.

1062
01:06:03,170 --> 01:06:08,069
Scott: This racing movie with Dom DeLuise told us that, yes, cannonballs can run.

1063
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:15,658
Rym: Sean Connery.

1064
01:06:16,201 --> 01:06:18,336
Rym: I'll not pay this fine I've incurred.

1065
01:06:18,396 --> 01:06:18,899
Scott: It's unjust.

1066
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:21,968
Scott: You don't have to pay that Jerry Lewis.

1067
01:06:22,449 --> 01:06:23,873
Scott: Okay, let's just move on.

1068
01:06:23,953 --> 01:06:26,320
Rym: Bert, can you please pick a category?

1069
01:06:27,349 --> 01:06:27,900
Rym: Pick swords.
