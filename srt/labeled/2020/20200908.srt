1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,730
Rym: It's Tuesday, September 8th, 2020.

2
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:10,890
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,426 --> 00:00:13,800
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:15,660
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight.

5
00:00:15,961 --> 00:00:21,520
Rym: We are talking about Logitech G's Playmaster software for Counter-Strike.

6
00:00:23,182 --> 00:00:24,218
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:25,682 --> 00:00:29,160
Rym: You know, I haven't really taken days off until this past weekend.

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,800
Rym: I took a Friday off and I had a Monday holiday.

9
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,319
Rym: So I had four days where I didn't have to do work.

10
00:00:35,221 --> 00:00:37,600
Rym: That's the longest vacation I've had since COVID started.

11
00:00:39,026 --> 00:00:39,580
Rym: It was weird.

12
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,199
Rym: Like, today I had to remember what the hell I do for a job.

13
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,700
Rym: Like, I log into this email system and all these people are, like, emailing me asking for stuff.

14
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,503
Rym: And I'm just like, "What?

15
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:48,989
Rym: What do you want?

16
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:49,973
Rym: Who are you again?

17
00:00:50,034 --> 00:00:50,415
Rym: What do I

18
00:00:50,476 --> 00:00:50,616
Rym: do?".

19
00:00:52,021 --> 00:00:54,339
Rym: Also, my boss is on vacation all week, so that's fun, too.

20
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,558
Scott: Yeah, I definitely did not know what to do.

21
00:00:57,242 --> 00:00:59,112
Scott: And I started work again today.

22
00:00:59,132 --> 00:00:59,736
Scott: I was like,

23
00:00:59,756 --> 00:00:59,836
Scott: "Argh.".

24
00:01:01,922 --> 00:01:05,640
Scott: Well, the worst part is... And I have meetings all day, so that kind of actually helped.

25
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,316
Scott: 'Cause it's like, "Oh, I'll just figure out what I got to do while I'm in all these

26
00:01:08,356 --> 00:01:08,678
Scott: meetings.".

27
00:01:09,121 --> 00:01:09,322
Rym: Yeah.

28
00:01:09,543 --> 00:01:12,560
Rym: The problem is, I got to run meetings, a lot of these meetings.

29
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:15,400
Rym: I had to run meetings where I had to remember, "Why did I set up this meeting?

30
00:01:15,641 --> 00:01:19,019
Rym: What was so important to last week Rym that I made a

31
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:19,180
Rym: meeting?".

32
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:23,098
Scott: Well, at least if I set up a meeting, I can click on the calendar thing and it'll tell me what it's for.

33
00:01:24,741 --> 00:01:26,260
Rym: But, yeah, it was weird to be back at work.

34
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:31,960
Rym: And I still got four more days I can use, assuming I'm going to save all ten till next year, that I can save.

35
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,172
Rym: So maybe I'll use some for packs.

36
00:01:34,937 --> 00:01:35,260
Rym: We'll see.

37
00:01:37,402 --> 00:01:40,400
Rym: Maybe I can sneak upstate and try to do some distanced apple picking.

38
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,460
Scott: Yeah, we'll see about the apple picking situation.

39
00:01:45,142 --> 00:01:48,960
Rym: I feel like if I want to do that, that's like a Wednesday type thing, like in the middle of the week.

40
00:01:50,162 --> 00:01:52,577
Scott: We've ordered some apples that were delivered.

41
00:01:52,617 --> 00:01:53,120
Scott: They're enormous.

42
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,663
Rym: I just like apple picking.

43
00:01:54,683 --> 00:02:01,080
Rym: I usually can't eat the apples we pick because of my sensitivity to pollen in apple skins.

44
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,059
Scott: I mean, apple picking's nice, but I actually like a little cider donut.

45
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,039
Rym: Oh yeah, I get the cider donut with the cider.

46
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,340
Scott: A little apple cider.

47
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:09,908
Rym: Cider donut with the cider cider.

48
00:02:10,473 --> 00:02:11,260
Rym: Some mulled wine.

49
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,720
Scott: Welcome to my country apple farm.

50
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,787
Rym: Go see, there's like the goat.

51
00:02:15,847 --> 00:02:16,370
Rym: that's friendly.

52
00:02:16,411 --> 00:02:17,940
Rym: You can go poke at, see some horses.

53
00:02:18,622 --> 00:02:19,378
Scott: Feed a goat an apple.

54
00:02:21,101 --> 00:02:25,600
Rym: Normal times is be surrounded by all the New York City people who also went upstate to experience these things.

55
00:02:27,861 --> 00:02:28,825
Rym: So there's a bunch of news.

56
00:02:28,845 --> 00:02:32,580
Rym: We'll only talk about a few highlights, I think, because we don't want to make this like the news show.

57
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:40,660
Rym: We actually have a lot to say about the main topic, but the biggest gaming news was probably that if you didn't see this coming, you probably had your head under a rock.

58
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,420
Rym: Like, this was definitely coming for a long time, but now it's official.

59
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:45,886
Rym: Magfest is cancelled.

60
00:02:45,927 --> 00:02:47,740
Rym: There is no Magfest in January.

61
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,489
Scott: Yeah, it's number one.

62
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,500
Scott: I knew there wasn't going to be a Magfest in January.

63
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,297
Rym: Not because we had secret knowledge, because...

64
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,019
Scott: Common sense?

65
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:56,882
Rym: Yeah.

66
00:02:56,902 --> 00:03:01,780
Rym: Granted, Katsu-Kan is not cancelled yet, and Katsu-Kan happens shortly after Magfest.

67
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,139
Scott: Katsu-Kan doesn't have common sense.

68
00:03:04,662 --> 00:03:04,822
Rym: Yeah.

69
00:03:05,263 --> 00:03:06,606
Rym: Magfest did the right thing.

70
00:03:06,626 --> 00:03:11,136
Rym: I see a lot of people online really mad about this.

71
00:03:11,196 --> 00:03:12,880
Rym: Like, what the fuck is wrong with you?

72
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,880
Scott: Like, you would actually go to a Magfest?

73
00:03:15,242 --> 00:03:15,560
Scott: Like, really?

74
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,492
Rym: I filled out that survey, and I was like, no, I would not come.

75
00:03:18,512 --> 00:03:20,220
Rym: I even told Magfest, like, look...

76
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:27,580
Scott: I also don't understand the people who, like, have common sense, and they knew it wouldn't happen, but then it's like, well, you're sad when it's finally announced.

77
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,077
Scott: It's like, if you're going to be sad, the time to be sad was a long time ago.

78
00:03:33,157 --> 00:03:33,558
Scott: Like, why?

79
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:34,060
Scott: I don't understand.

80
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,029
Rym: Yeah, I mean, I guess some people, like, you might not mourn it until you get the news.

81
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:40,219
Rym: Like, I guess I mourned Magfest about three months ago.

82
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:52,000
Scott: As soon as After PAX East was over, and the world set on fire, it's like, it took about a couple weeks, and I'm like, well, I guess we're not going to any conventions until... It was a pretty quick progression.

83
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,320
Scott: You're like, at minimum, East 21, if not West 21.

84
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,568
Rym: At first it was like, "PAX West has, like, a 1%

85
00:03:59,568 --> 00:03:59,949
Rym: chance.".

86
00:04:00,731 --> 00:04:02,996
Rym: And then it went from that to, "See ya in

87
00:04:02,996 --> 00:04:04,623
Rym: 2022.".

88
00:04:04,623 --> 00:04:05,359
Scott: Yep, pretty much.

89
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,943
Rym: Like, maybe.

90
00:04:07,023 --> 00:04:15,700
Rym: I think, like, the last half of 2021 is the earliest possible time, but, considering the way America's going, I'm not too faithful in that.

91
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,640
Rym: I've seen those numbers of people who won't get vaccinated, and I don't know what to do about that.

92
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:34,340
Scott: So, anyway, even though Magfest is cancelled, a lot of people may not realize that, you know, unlike Packs, which is a for-profit endeavor, right, run by Reed and any arcade company, right, Magfest is a lot like Otakon.

93
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:36,740
Rym: It's a 501(c)(3), it's a non-profit.

94
00:04:37,321 --> 00:04:40,989
Scott: It's a non-profit, and it actually does things all year round.

95
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:45,740
Scott: The Super Magfest event in National Harbor is just their biggest event.

96
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:50,857
Rym: Yeah, what we call Magfest, what most people call Magfest, is their, like, main event, but they got a ton of other stuff.

97
00:04:50,877 --> 00:04:51,620
Rym: They got Magstock.

98
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:58,140
Scott: Yeah, Magfest does a lot of things with all the money that they mostly make from the one event.

99
00:04:58,421 --> 00:05:03,091
Scott: Yeah, they have, it's like, a lot of for-, and I don't think that's foolish of them.

100
00:05:03,391 --> 00:05:07,280
Scott: There are many, many, many non-profits that operate the same way.

101
00:05:07,801 --> 00:05:19,800
Scott: If you look, you know, at, like, your local museum probably has, like, one big annual fundraiser that accounts for probably half or more than half of their revenues per year, right?

102
00:05:20,461 --> 00:05:21,624
Scott: So, Magfest is similar.

103
00:05:21,704 --> 00:05:27,657
Scott: Super Magfest in National Harbor, the Magfest event, accounts for probably most of their money, I'm guessing.

104
00:05:27,697 --> 00:05:28,980
Scott: I don't know what their money is, right?

105
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,040
Rym: Yeah, I've never looked into that.

106
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,606
Scott: It seems quite obvious, just based on the numbers, right?

107
00:05:33,646 --> 00:05:42,040
Scott: You know, you can see how many people watch, like, the Magfest Twitch stream when it goes live, or how many people go to MagWest, or any of those other Mag events, right?

108
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,645
Scott: It's like, yeah, they're making most of their money on Super Mag, right?

109
00:05:46,006 --> 00:05:46,446
Scott: Clearly.

110
00:05:48,008 --> 00:05:56,080
Scott: Which means, if they cancel the event, which is, I think, why they were so hesitant to cancel, despite there being no alternative, is that, what are they gonna do about money?

111
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:03,680
Scott: So, to prevent Magfest itself from dying, they're gonna have some sort of telethon thing.

112
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,720
Rym: Coming up real soon, like September 13th, like next week.

113
00:06:07,761 --> 00:06:17,659
Scott: Yeah, so, you know, if you want Magfest to survive, you can go help them out, but, on the other hand, it's like, you know, if you got money to go-

114
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:37,360
Rym: Yeah, like, Magfest is real important to me, but I'm sending a lot of money to Democrats and to bail funds right now, because those are- If the Democrats don't win, and people don't get out of jail for, like, exercising their First Amendment rights, then there won't be a Magfest anyway.

115
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:45,210
Scott: Right, it's like, it's seen in The Matrix, like, what good is it if you have no mouth to speak, right?

116
00:06:46,812 --> 00:06:52,080
Scott: It's like, if there's no national harbor, what good is there of Magfest, right?

117
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:54,982
Rym: So, we'll see.

118
00:06:55,002 --> 00:07:03,839
Rym: I might submit some stuff to the telethon, like, art, because they're looking, like, they want, like, 60 second, like, "Hey, send us a video, talk about Magfest for 60

119
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:04,140
Rym: seconds.".

120
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,402
Rym: Like, fun stuff like that.

121
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:15,240
Rym: I'm happy to do stuff like that, but I'm sure some of you out there, because one thing Magfest has always had is a big culture of the attendees paying more just to make Magfest happen.

122
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,099
Rym: Like, the special badges and all that stuff.

123
00:07:18,401 --> 00:07:19,660
Scott: Well, that don't get you any privileges.

124
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,500
Rym: Yeah, which I've always actually really liked.

125
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,392
Scott: They get you a fancier badge.

126
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:30,736
Rym: Yeah, like, I hated the comic cons that are like, "This badge costs 400 more dollars, and you get, like, Stan Lee will lick

127
00:07:30,776 --> 00:07:30,936
Rym: you.".

128
00:07:31,398 --> 00:07:32,360
Rym: Like, that kind of nonsense.

129
00:07:33,062 --> 00:07:34,339
Scott: Oh, zombie Stan Lee, no.

130
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:38,239
Rym: I feel like a certain population would pay more for that.

131
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:39,227
Rym: Yeah.

132
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:47,291
Rym: But Magfest, it was like, "Yeah, you can pay more, and we'll give you swag, so other people know you paid more, but we're not going to give you anything.

133
00:07:47,311 --> 00:07:50,055
Rym: You've still got to stand in line for, like, a panel you want to see.

134
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:51,738
Rym: You don't get to cut the line of the initial

135
00:07:51,758 --> 00:07:52,219
Rym: demachine.".

136
00:07:53,001 --> 00:07:53,182
Scott: Nope.

137
00:07:54,453 --> 00:07:55,300
Scott: No one cuts that line.

138
00:07:57,244 --> 00:07:58,299
Rym: That line also doesn't move.

139
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:03,571
Rym: But yeah, this is, I know this is sad, but at the same time, there's no way around this.

140
00:08:03,672 --> 00:08:07,000
Rym: Like, I don't, I think Magfest can survive.

141
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:18,280
Rym: I do think, however, and, like, if you're not thinking about this, but you have a lot of cons, you've got to be ready for the reality that I think a lot of smaller fan-run cons are just going to go under.

142
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:24,160
Scott: Yeah, I think just a lot of, you had to, a lot of things are going to go under.

143
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,846
Rym: Yeah, a lot of movie theaters are going to go bankrupt.

144
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,111
Rym: Like, they're just going to shut down.

145
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:29,540
Rym: A lot of dinner theater, a lot of community theater.

146
00:08:30,322 --> 00:08:34,029
Scott: Yeah, and so I think, you know, it's just, it's like, okay, right?

147
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:38,980
Scott: It's like something goes out of business, and then there's some debt that exists there, right?

148
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,684
Scott: And that debt just never gets paid because someone went bankrupt.

149
00:08:42,285 --> 00:08:49,980
Scott: And then there's now, like, you know, empty space for new things to appear, and it'll just be sort of a changeover.

150
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,004
Rym: Like, imagine the year, like, 2023.

151
00:08:53,004 --> 00:08:59,594
Rym: The thirst, the angry, horny thirst for conventions is going to be an unstoppable resource.

152
00:09:00,214 --> 00:09:04,000
Rym: New cons can get investors and start from scratch if they need to.

153
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,462
Rym: The staff will exist.

154
00:09:06,063 --> 00:09:16,080
Rym: If a small con goes under, it would be a smart move for basically the same con with a different name, but most of the same staff to just reform in a couple years.

155
00:09:16,341 --> 00:09:24,840
Scott: Right, so in a functioning society that bailed things, bailed out failing things from the bottom and not from the top, believing in some trickle-down nonsense, right?

156
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,728
Scott: We would just prop up everything and say, oh, these are all successful businesses.

157
00:09:29,049 --> 00:09:34,260
Scott: They'll all just can't be successful right now because it's a global pandemic and other things, right?

158
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:40,247
Scott: We'll just prop them up until they can be functional later, right?

159
00:09:40,907 --> 00:09:42,129
Scott: And then everything would be fine.

160
00:09:42,189 --> 00:09:52,540
Scott: But instead, we're just going to have everything go out of business, and then everything start new businesses after, and you will be basically back where you started, assuming there is an after.

161
00:09:53,641 --> 00:09:54,903
Scott: Right, assuming there is an after.

162
00:09:55,764 --> 00:10:00,950
Scott: Everything will just come back because the demand will not go anywhere, right?

163
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:08,218
Scott: The desire to go to a convention, assuming a convention is a profitable business to begin with, you know, a viable business is not profitable.

164
00:10:08,258 --> 00:10:10,180
Scott: It's a nonprofit, but you get the idea.

165
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,224
Rym: The commercial cons, like, they'll be fine.

166
00:10:13,324 --> 00:10:17,370
Rym: They'll come back because those companies have deep pockets and make money from them.

167
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:24,160
Rym: They'd also don't make as much of their money from the badges as from a lot of other stuff, so there's a lot of factors at play.

168
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,860
Scott: But Magfest isn't selling giant booths to Sony or whoever.

169
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:33,599
Rym: Yeah, Magfest just has a giant expo hall of stuff that is not that expensive to be in.

170
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:34,556
Scott: Nope.

171
00:10:35,721 --> 00:10:37,505
Rym: So, Godspeed, Magfest.

172
00:10:37,626 --> 00:10:42,939
Rym: I hope you survive and just keep an eye on this space like there's nothing else we can really do.

173
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,016
Scott: Nope.

174
00:10:44,781 --> 00:10:45,719
Scott: So, there's some tennis news.

175
00:10:46,741 --> 00:10:47,121
Scott: Oh, yeah.

176
00:10:47,181 --> 00:10:54,651
Scott: So, because of the pandemic and whatnot, most of the injuries also, right?

177
00:10:55,312 --> 00:10:59,938
Scott: You know, a lot of the top tennis players are not playing in the US Open in Queens, right?

178
00:11:00,098 --> 00:11:01,179
Scott: A stone's throw from here.

179
00:11:02,861 --> 00:11:07,240
Scott: Which always happens in the Labor Day weekend and we miss it because of PAX West, which didn't happen, obviously.

180
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,110
Scott: We would have just been coming home from PAX West now.

181
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:14,000
Scott: There normally wouldn't be a GeekNights today, so enjoy it, I guess.

182
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:22,144
Scott: But Novak Djokovic, who decided he was going to throw a party with no masks and, you know, be a- Oh, shit.

183
00:11:22,204 --> 00:11:23,231
Rym: I forgot all about that.

184
00:11:23,372 --> 00:11:24,600
Scott: Okay, yeah, fuck him.

185
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,485
Scott: He basically, like, you know, until now, right?

186
00:11:27,565 --> 00:11:33,715
Scott: It was sort of like, you know, Federer, you know, the older guy, Nadal, the slightly younger guy, right?

187
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,400
Scott: And this Djokovic guy off to the side, right?

188
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:42,617
Scott: And, you know, I didn't really, you know, I knew a little bit about their personalities and who they were, but, you know, not that much.

189
00:11:42,677 --> 00:11:43,660
Scott: I didn't really care either.

190
00:11:45,161 --> 00:11:50,399
Scott: But basically, over the past few months, Djokovic has revealed himself to be the shithead.

191
00:11:50,841 --> 00:11:51,657
Rym: Yep, yep, yep.

192
00:11:51,862 --> 00:11:52,399
Rym: Of the bunch.

193
00:11:52,803 --> 00:11:55,079
Rym: I just didn't connect that they were both him.

194
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:56,777
Scott: Yeah, no, it's that guy.

195
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:04,900
Scott: So, you know, he was trying to catch up to Federer and Nadal in terms of, you know, major tennis tournaments won.

196
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:10,357
Scott: And he could have won this one probably easily because they're not there, right?

197
00:12:10,578 --> 00:12:11,200
Scott: It was a shoo-in.

198
00:12:12,702 --> 00:12:18,140
Scott: And he goes, you know, he's got a little temper tantrum or whatever, he's mad about something, you know, so he smacks the tennis ball.

199
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:25,920
Scott: And not only does he smack it in anger, which is already not great, he smacks it, happens to hit someone in the head, right?

200
00:12:26,641 --> 00:12:28,320
Scott: You know, the person who stands in the back.

201
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,620
Scott: Yeah, collecting the balls, right?

202
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:40,120
Scott: And the rules of tennis are, well, if you do that, you're defaulted, which basically means kicked out of the whole tournament, but not just kicked out of the whole tournament.

203
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:46,380
Scott: You lose all your prize money, and there might still be, it doesn't cancel out the fact that you still might get fined.

204
00:12:47,542 --> 00:12:51,400
Scott: And you don't get any points, because remember, tennis has a global point system, right?

205
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:58,520
Scott: So if you go play tennis at your local tennis club, you get ranked on the same point ranking system as Novak Djokovic is.

206
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:02,416
Scott: Which is cool, because actually- You can say, oh, he's number one, and I'm number 30 billion.

207
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,906
Rym: What's cool is that's actually how a lot of esports work, too.

208
00:13:05,987 --> 00:13:11,200
Rym: Like, you play Overwatch, you're ranked with, like, the pros have their own ranks, like, they're just in the game like everyone else.

209
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,520
Scott: Yeah, most individual sports do this, right?

210
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:13,740
Scott: Yeah.

211
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,779
Scott: But the tennis one is really kind of fun.

212
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,980
Scott: Anyway, so he's getting no points, which obviously is gonna help the people who still play and catch up to him.

213
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:26,740
Scott: Also, someone's gonna win who's not one of those three people, which hasn't happened in a long time.

214
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,300
Scott: I guess I think the Andy Murray win of Wimbledon maybe once, I think?

215
00:13:30,922 --> 00:13:32,895
Scott: And that was sort of like the last time, maybe?

216
00:13:32,915 --> 00:13:33,620
Scott: I don't remember.

217
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:37,599
Scott: I'm not that into the tennis, I'm only a little bit into the tennis.

218
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:37,900
Scott: Anyway.

219
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:43,640
Scott: But the point I want to bring up here is not only is Djokovic on the shit list, he's been on there for a while.

220
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:52,080
Scott: But now he's really deep in the shit list, and this is probably gonna be, like, define his career and the public perception of him forever as, like, bad guy.

221
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,597
Scott: Which is fine, deserve it.

222
00:13:56,001 --> 00:14:03,500
Scott: Is that I want to reiterate the point that, A, look at sports enforcing their rules.

223
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,920
Scott: Why can't the society enforce its rules properly, as the same way sports do?

224
00:14:09,421 --> 00:14:11,319
Rym: Or why can't esports even do this?

225
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:31,800
Rym: Right, it's like we see all the time people committing white collar crimes, cops committing crimes, esports- -who are in the tennis world actually care about the appearance of things like fairness and good sportsmanship.

226
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:32,722
Scott: Sure.

227
00:14:32,742 --> 00:14:39,480
Scott: Yeah, but the point is, we need to set up this kind of situation, right, where rules are enforced, right?

228
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,449
Rym: But rules are also just.

229
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:42,253
Rym: That's the key.

230
00:14:42,495 --> 00:14:43,440
Rym: Just and enforced.

231
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,916
Scott: Regardless, where rules are enforced properly, right?

232
00:14:47,781 --> 00:14:49,791
Scott: And here you have, clearly, right?

233
00:14:50,012 --> 00:14:51,158
Scott: Oh, the number one guy.

234
00:14:51,238 --> 00:14:51,560
Scott: Sorry.

235
00:14:52,563 --> 00:14:53,391
Scott: The rule is the rule.

236
00:14:53,431 --> 00:14:53,815
Scott: You're out.

237
00:14:54,239 --> 00:14:54,400
Scott: See ya.

238
00:14:54,400 --> 00:15:03,760
Rym: It's interesting because in this case, it was a little bit of bad luck in the sense that you see a lot of sports feel like they throw their glove down and a little bit of frustration, or they throw their stick down.

239
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,297
Scott: Yeah, don't do that.

240
00:15:05,061 --> 00:15:13,220
Rym: But that's not usually a final offense by itself, but you went through this extra step of like pulled a ball out and just spiked it randomly, basically.

241
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:13,961
Scott: Yeah.

242
00:15:14,061 --> 00:15:18,500
Scott: You can also, if you want to see this, you know, there's a lot of sexist and racist angles on this.

243
00:15:19,061 --> 00:15:25,640
Scott: If you look at the news articles from when, you know, all the time Serena Williams would get angry at tennis, right?

244
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:29,348
Scott: And people would write news articles like, "Oh, she's so angry.

245
00:15:29,609 --> 00:15:31,453
Scott: Look at this, you know, angry Serena

246
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:31,854
Scott: Williams.".

247
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:34,802
Scott: Look at this.

248
00:15:34,983 --> 00:15:38,076
Scott: Yeah, a lot of people are like, "Oh, it was an accident.

249
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:38,880
Scott: Oh.".

250
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,383
Scott: It's like,

251
00:15:39,645 --> 00:15:39,826
Scott: "Oh.".

252
00:15:39,907 --> 00:15:41,035
Scott: It's like, "Uh,

253
00:15:41,095 --> 00:15:41,317
Scott: really?"

254
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:41,740
Scott: You know.

255
00:15:42,601 --> 00:15:49,280
Scott: Anyway, a little, you know, inequality in the treatment of a sports journalist world on this.

256
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:55,160
Rym: In terms of like, even though, you know, you probably didn't intend to hit the linesman, but it's like in hockey with high sticking.

257
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,020
Rym: If your stick gets high, sure.

258
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,510
Scott: Yeah, control your shit.

259
00:15:59,741 --> 00:16:06,880
Rym: No matter what your intent was, the risk you took by having your stick that high is that you might- It would create a dangerous situation, intentional or not, right?

260
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,236
Scott: Yep, exactly.

261
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,311
Scott: It would punish you.

262
00:16:08,331 --> 00:16:08,920
Rym: I don't care why you did it.

263
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,119
Rym: That's why hockey punishes high sticking so severely.

264
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,086
Scott: We can't tell why you did something.

265
00:16:13,126 --> 00:16:14,993
Scott: We can only punish actions.

266
00:16:15,033 --> 00:16:16,880
Scott: We cannot adjudicate intent.

267
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:17,207
Scott: Yep.

268
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,713
Scott: Intent should have nothing to do with it.

269
00:16:18,754 --> 00:16:18,936
Scott: Anyway.

270
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:19,940
Rym: Yep.

271
00:16:20,181 --> 00:16:26,300
Rym: So that's just like why the delay of game penalty happens, and it's always frustrating, but there's a reason that happens.

272
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:26,601
Scott: Right.

273
00:16:26,821 --> 00:16:33,720
Scott: So I also just want to add in the second part, which is that the penalty for cheating, this wasn't cheating, right?

274
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:44,420
Scott: But the penalty for pretty much anything that you want to actually, you know, have, you know, influence people's behavior always needs to be losing.

275
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,010
Scott: You can't have a penalty short of losing.

276
00:16:47,051 --> 00:16:48,719
Scott: I've talked about this before, right?

277
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:54,400
Scott: Where like the Patriots cheat at football and the penalty is some fines or some draft picks and then they win the Super Bowl.

278
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,793
Rym: Because that means that that's not cheating.

279
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:56,520
Rym: That's part of the game.

280
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:57,500
Scott: Right.

281
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,082
Scott: That is basically pay to win, right?

282
00:17:00,142 --> 00:17:20,179
Scott: If you just fined him for this, right, then you'd basically be, that would be the equivalent of saying, you know, saying if you hit one of the ball people, right, in anger, and you have to pay a fine, and that's the only penalty, you're basically, that's the exact same thing as saying feel free to hit the ball people.

283
00:17:20,378 --> 00:17:21,859
Scott: It only costs this much to do so.

284
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:25,509
Rym: Yeah, I guess the only difference here is that you gain nothing by doing so.

285
00:17:26,371 --> 00:17:30,180
Rym: But deflating some footballs or stealing some signals, you gain something.

286
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:30,980
Scott: Right.

287
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,505
Scott: The point is the penalty for breaking the rules in.

288
00:17:34,565 --> 00:17:37,869
Scott: pretty much anything needs to be losing.

289
00:17:37,949 --> 00:17:47,480
Scott: There cannot be another, you can add on other penalties if you want, but to not have losing be the penalty is what creates room for corruption.

290
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:52,466
Scott: It's like, oh, yeah, I did all these money crimes and look at me, I'm still in office, right?

291
00:17:53,127 --> 00:17:53,728
Scott: Oh, look at me.

292
00:17:53,888 --> 00:17:56,071
Scott: I, you know, my company polluted the river.

293
00:17:56,151 --> 00:17:57,552
Scott: I'm still the CEO, right?

294
00:17:57,613 --> 00:18:01,678
Scott: It's like, no, the penalty needs to be losing, right?

295
00:18:01,738 --> 00:18:03,540
Scott: There's no other penalty that works, right?

296
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,204
Rym: Well, Overwatch handles that pretty well.

297
00:18:06,324 --> 00:18:14,260
Rym: Not like the pro level, they mostly handle it, but it felt like regular old play, like people lose their accounts for doing things like quitting competitive matches.

298
00:18:15,181 --> 00:18:15,361
Scott: Right.

299
00:18:15,482 --> 00:18:19,912
Scott: It's, you know, anyway, so there you go.

300
00:18:20,052 --> 00:18:23,220
Scott: Another great example of the penalty being losing and it actually works.

301
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,807
Rym: So light news because it was just announced and people are going crazy about it.

302
00:18:27,388 --> 00:18:32,920
Rym: We're all waiting for Breath of the Wild 2, but in the interim, we're getting another Hyrule Warriors game, Age of Calamity.

303
00:18:33,441 --> 00:18:33,641
Scott: Yeah.

304
00:18:33,721 --> 00:18:38,689
Scott: So there was already a Hyrule Warriors game that came out and it was basically what everyone expected.

305
00:18:39,691 --> 00:18:41,735
Scott: Only it looks like Zelda.

306
00:18:41,795 --> 00:18:44,159
Scott: And now they make their say, well, that game did well enough.

307
00:18:44,199 --> 00:18:45,000
Scott: Let's do another one.

308
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:50,328
Scott: And this time we'll mix in some Breath of the Wild characters because everyone loves the sexy shark man.

309
00:18:50,728 --> 00:18:53,552
Scott: So let's do the same thing again.

310
00:18:53,793 --> 00:18:57,158
Scott: Only mix in some Breath of the Wild and we'll sell more copies.

311
00:18:57,198 --> 00:18:58,780
Scott: And I think that'll probably work out just fine.

312
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:59,441
Scott: I think it will.

313
00:18:59,501 --> 00:19:12,400
Rym: Cause that game was crazy popular as a, like the percentage I was looking up these numbers a while ago, the percentage of sales of that game compared to like number of Wii U sold was weirdly high.

314
00:19:12,921 --> 00:19:13,141
Scott: Yeah.

315
00:19:13,161 --> 00:19:15,885
Scott: I'm actually liking this trend that Nintendo's going on here.

316
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:20,392
Scott: They realize that sort of like, you know, okay, Mario is their big property, right?

317
00:19:20,452 --> 00:19:25,539
Scott: And they've always done tons of Mario games, Mario carts, Mario parties, you know, Mario RPGs.

318
00:19:26,661 --> 00:19:27,943
Scott: They got paper Marios.

319
00:19:27,983 --> 00:19:29,405
Scott: They got regular Marios.

320
00:19:29,425 --> 00:19:30,106
Scott: They got 3D.

321
00:19:30,147 --> 00:19:31,349
Scott: I got so many Marios, right?

322
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:32,891
Scott: They covered every base with the Mario.

323
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:36,437
Scott: Zelda is also the huge second huge property for Nintendo.

324
00:19:36,597 --> 00:19:38,060
Scott: I guess Pokemon is also right.

325
00:19:38,402 --> 00:19:41,620
Rym: But only recently have they started like letting more Zelda games happen.

326
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:42,481
Scott: Exactly.

327
00:19:42,501 --> 00:19:44,870
Scott: The Pokemon, they make all kinds of Pokemon games, right?

328
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:47,340
Scott: They got your Pokemon snaps and your Pokemon pinballs.

329
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,000
Rym: Pokemon Go.

330
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,202
Scott: Right.

331
00:19:49,222 --> 00:19:49,423
Scott: Yeah.

332
00:19:49,443 --> 00:19:50,769
Scott: So many Pokemon games, right?

333
00:19:50,809 --> 00:19:51,734
Scott: Not just the main ones.

334
00:19:51,754 --> 00:19:52,980
Scott: They also got the main ones, obviously.

335
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:59,109
Scott: Zelda, despite it being one of their top properties, they have not made lots and lots of Zelda games.

336
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,973
Scott: They made relatively few.

337
00:20:01,013 --> 00:20:05,420
Scott: There are the main Zelda games and there were a few here and there, you know.

338
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,820
Rym: I still think part of that was because they got burned so bad on those CDI games.

339
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,840
Scott: I don't know if they still remember that.

340
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:15,086
Rym: I think that for at least our time influenced them.

341
00:20:15,567 --> 00:20:17,311
Rym: But, yeah, like you said, we're way past that.

342
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:21,640
Rym: But I knew this change was happening when Cadence of Hyrule came out.

343
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,620
Rym: That's the game I would have never have expected to exist.

344
00:20:25,221 --> 00:20:25,441
Scott: Yep.

345
00:20:25,481 --> 00:20:45,380
Scott: So for the Cadence of Hyrule, the Hyrule Warriors, now we got a second Hyrule Warriors, I think you're going to be seeing now, going forward, we can expect probably, maybe annually, I would assume at minimum, a Zelda game that is not a main Zelda game, but is simply a game that features, you know, Link, Zelda, Ganon, Hyrule.

346
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:51,779
Rym: It's good timing, too, because everyone like Breath of the Wild 2 is gonna be nuts, but it's a ways out.

347
00:20:52,963 --> 00:20:53,091
Scott: Flute.

348
00:20:53,863 --> 00:20:54,239
Scott: Ocarina.

349
00:20:54,951 --> 00:20:55,439
Rym: Red Potion.

350
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:56,336
Rym: Blue Potion.

351
00:20:57,806 --> 00:20:58,980
Scott: All the Zelda, bow and arrow.

352
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:00,431
Scott: Boomerang.

353
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:01,158
Scott: Bomb.

354
00:21:02,882 --> 00:21:04,937
Scott: Those are the characters in Zelda, I can't.

355
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,140
Rym: So, well, you're thinking Old Man, Old Woman.

356
00:21:08,784 --> 00:21:09,398
Scott: I said Old Man.

357
00:21:09,922 --> 00:21:10,300
Rym: Dodongo.

358
00:21:11,191 --> 00:21:11,319
Scott: Yeah.

359
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,859
Scott: Just like Smoke, you know that.

360
00:21:14,021 --> 00:21:29,400
Rym: But I'm not gonna play this game because I've played Dynasty Warriors games, I know they're not for me, like I do not enjoy that kind of game at all, but I think this game is very well timed because everyone is so hungry for more Zelda, and Breath of the Wild 2 is a ways out.

361
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:35,780
Rym: Like, we don't even know anything about Breath of the Wild 2, people, it's not coming out this year.

362
00:21:36,603 --> 00:21:38,640
Scott: No, it's just rumor at this point, right?

363
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:46,920
Scott: Metroid Prime 4 is less of a rumor, but that got basically, they didn't like where the direction they were going and they restarted the whole thing, so that's gonna be super delayed.

364
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,580
Rym: So, alright, so you wanna talk about this 8BitDo controller?

365
00:21:52,524 --> 00:21:53,300
Scott: Oh, yeah, just briefly.

366
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:57,280
Scott: So, you know, we talked about 8BitDo a while ago, right?

367
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:03,240
Scott: And, you know, they're a thunk company that's making controllers for almost every platform.

368
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,940
Rym: I got two of their SNES ones for the Switch and they're just great.

369
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,840
Scott: Yeah, they're making really good controllers that work with everything.

370
00:22:10,961 --> 00:22:14,980
Scott: And they finally went and did something they hadn't done before, which is to make a fight stick.

371
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:20,880
Scott: It's basically a lot like, you know, the old NES, you know, Advantage kind of deal, right?

372
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:26,360
Scott: You can play some Street Fighter with this, you can play some, you know, any old arcade game with this.

373
00:22:26,801 --> 00:22:30,759
Scott: I think it works with a Switch or a PC, it doesn't work with a PlayStation or an Xbox, I don't think.

374
00:22:32,766 --> 00:22:33,820
Scott: It's highly customizable.

375
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:37,480
Scott: If you don't like their buttons or their stick, you can replace those parts very easily.

376
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,940
Scott: I think that's pretty much par for the course for fight sticks these days.

377
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,240
Rym: I mean, even my ancient fight stick, I can swap out the gate if nothing else.

378
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,099
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

379
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,540
Scott: So, you know, this is pretty nice looking.

380
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,740
Scott: If I didn't already have a fight stick, I might get this one.

381
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,880
Scott: It looks smaller than the one I have and better.

382
00:22:55,161 --> 00:23:09,900
Scott: So, yeah, if you're looking for, if you don't already have a fighting stick type controller and you play ever, if you ever play a fighting game or an arcade game, something like, you know, I don't know, what's a good, what's an arcade game that's not a fighting game where you have a stick?

383
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,776
Rym: A good arcade game that's not a fighting game?

384
00:23:11,836 --> 00:23:12,159
Rym: Initial D?

385
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:12,540
Scott: Dig Dug.

386
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,199
Rym: Driving game.

387
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:14,699
Scott: I mean, you know, Dig Dug.

388
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:15,147
Scott: Ah!

389
00:23:16,308 --> 00:23:16,679
Scott: Pac-Man.

390
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,170
Scott: I don't know.

391
00:23:18,923 --> 00:23:19,260
Scott: Whatever.

392
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:22,900
Rym: Because my fight stick, there's no way to plug my existing fight stick into my Switch.

393
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:27,360
Scott: Yeah, I guess the fight sticks we have work with everything but Switch.

394
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,115
Scott: Anyway.

395
00:23:30,081 --> 00:23:30,500
Scott: But there you go.

396
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,439
Scott: This is looking pretty good.

397
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,756
Scott: Just want to let people know what's out there.

398
00:23:33,866 --> 00:23:34,560
Scott: Have fun with it, maybe.

399
00:23:37,691 --> 00:23:38,007
Rym: So, yeah.

400
00:23:38,831 --> 00:23:39,889
Rym: Things of the day.

401
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:44,130
Rym: So, there was a tweet going around, pretty good tweet, about Rebecca Heinemann.

402
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:46,010
Rym: I hope I'm pronouncing her name correctly.

403
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:59,550
Rym: But she was known, among other things, for being basically the first person in America to ever win a national or, like, major esports tournament.

404
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:09,230
Scott: Yeah, I was not aware of, like, I knew that, like, yeah, back in the day they had, like, arcade game competitions, right?

405
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:15,228
Scott: Space Invaders, especially, you know, I'm sure Dig Dugs and all those other games, Asteroids, right?

406
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:21,909
Scott: There were competitions for those games back in the day, but none of them were, like, named events that were remembered in history.

407
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:23,966
Scott: There were people remembered who won, right?

408
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:27,090
Scott: There were, like, you know, local arcade kind of deals, right?

409
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:31,044
Scott: When arcades were huge and I was very small and couldn't even reach the joystick yet, right?

410
00:24:32,492 --> 00:24:38,629
Scott: You know, until the Nintendo World Championship there wasn't, like, a known esports event in history, I don't think.

411
00:24:38,951 --> 00:24:41,450
Scott: But apparently there were and they're just not remembered.

412
00:24:42,136 --> 00:24:42,305
Rym: Yep.

413
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,710
Rym: But this one was a big one.

414
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:50,650
Rym: It was a national tournament with, like, regional staging tournaments and Rebecca Heinemann.

415
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:51,750
Scott: What year was this?

416
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:54,510
Scott: Okay, so I wasn't even alive.

417
00:24:54,830 --> 00:25:01,330
Rym: So she went to LA to compete in the regional tournament for Space Invaders and didn't expect to win, like, didn't think she was that good.

418
00:25:01,911 --> 00:25:07,790
Rym: And she won and then she went on to the national championship in New York and also won.

419
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:12,530
Rym: So she's considered to be the first national video game tournament champion ever.

420
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:15,984
Scott: I cannot beat two levels in original Space Invaders.

421
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:17,790
Scott: I've tried.

422
00:25:18,031 --> 00:25:24,709
Rym: Yep, so the tweet was going around because she is a trans woman and her career is also pretty cool.

423
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:37,280
Rym: So, I actually want to link to that because she got her start with an Atari 2600 and she was pirating 2600 cartridges.

424
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:39,935
Scott: Nice!

425
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:44,065
Rym: She was, like, dumping the ROMs and making her own 2600 cartridges.

426
00:25:46,317 --> 00:25:48,450
Scott: Or had one cartridge and was, like, flashing it.

427
00:25:48,610 --> 00:26:00,490
Rym: She was doing stuff like that and from there learned enough about Atari 2600 code and reverse engineered enough to start, like, trying to make games with Avalon Hill and it was just.

428
00:26:00,571 --> 00:26:03,449
Rym: there's an amazing story here following this woman throughout her career.

429
00:26:06,071 --> 00:26:14,988
Rym: So, I enjoyed reading this Wikipedia article and she has a big hand in a lot of games that you may have played over the years.

430
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:28,750
Scott: So, apparently, I can't give too much information about this because I'm doing a Google Translate of an article in Finnish with two pictures to look at, right?

431
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:42,230
Scott: But, basically, it appears that the National Museum in Finland has loaned some super old board games to a game museum.

432
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:50,190
Scott: The National Library in Finland loaned some super old board games to a game museum in Finland to put on display.

433
00:26:51,750 --> 00:27:04,551
Scott: And these are games from, like, the board game Nordenskild, sorry Finnish people, Northeast Passage, published in 1879.

434
00:27:04,551 --> 00:27:09,429
Scott: Dealing with the most famous excursion of the Finnish explorer, Nordenskild, right?

435
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:12,750
Rym: I'm looking at the screenshot of this World War One game.

436
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:14,050
Scott: Right, exactly.

437
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:22,020
Scott: So, apparently, you know, not only have they put these ridiculously old games on display, but there's some lessons to be learned here.

438
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:31,070
Scott: that apparently in that area of the world, right, you know, they're talking about how, yeah, people made board games, like, about current events at the time.

439
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:31,793
Scott: This wasn't like.

440
00:27:32,154 --> 00:27:40,710
Scott: when we make a war game about Napoleon in the year 2020 and we're writing about, we're making a board game about Napoleon in '17, who knows when, right?

441
00:27:41,791 --> 00:27:48,790
Scott: This is someone, you know, making a game about sort of, like, a current-ish event, right?

442
00:27:49,131 --> 00:27:50,910
Scott: So, that still happens today.

443
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:54,089
Scott: People make board games about, like, current history a little bit, right?

444
00:27:54,511 --> 00:27:57,309
Scott: But that was, like, a thing then, you know?

445
00:27:58,512 --> 00:28:04,889
Scott: And just to have such crazy old board games on display, if anyone's in Finland, I assume it's a much safer place than here.

446
00:28:05,311 --> 00:28:09,490
Scott: I assume it's safe to go to museums there, you know, wearing masks and whatnot.

447
00:28:09,892 --> 00:28:11,048
Scott: You need to check this out.

448
00:28:11,911 --> 00:28:20,830
Scott: And if you can translate Finnish, provide a better translation of this article than Google Translate does so we can learn more about it because this seems really fascinating.

449
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:21,809
Rym: It looks pretty good.

450
00:28:22,891 --> 00:28:28,818
Scott: Even, you know, it's like, I've seen, you know, various, there's like a lot of exhibits in the U.S.

451
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:29,750
Scott: with, like, old games.

452
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:36,129
Scott: I've seen quite a few and they're usually only showing you, like, oh, here's a super old original monopoly.

453
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:38,069
Scott: Here's a super old Scrabble.

454
00:28:38,312 --> 00:28:40,110
Scott: And it's like, I'm not learning anything.

455
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:42,692
Rym: No, show me this Finnish game from 1918.

456
00:28:42,692 --> 00:28:43,430
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

457
00:28:43,912 --> 00:28:44,289
Scott: Exactly.

458
00:28:44,872 --> 00:28:45,689
Scott: So, good stuff.

459
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:51,770
Rym: So, in the Metamoment, we were live at the Crunchyroll Expo with JojaAnimeBite's cover and there was actually a pretty big crowd in there.

460
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:53,270
Rym: Like, it was a pretty good event.

461
00:28:53,534 --> 00:28:53,970
Rym: I was very happy.

462
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:58,130
Scott: Crunchyroll Expo, you know, we've talked about how the online cons are, right?

463
00:28:58,250 --> 00:28:59,327
Scott: How we perceive them to be.

464
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:03,070
Scott: Crunchyroll Expo, it's like, yeah, there was, they showed our panel.

465
00:29:03,955 --> 00:29:04,970
Scott: It was our recorded video.

466
00:29:05,072 --> 00:29:05,586
Scott: They played it.

467
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,589
Scott: People chatted while they watched it.

468
00:29:08,351 --> 00:29:14,110
Scott: And, you know, people were chatting during the, I watched the previous panel, which was a mecha history panel.

469
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,349
Scott: People were watching that one too.

470
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:19,316
Rym: I hung around during the break before the next panel and kept answering questions for a while.

471
00:29:20,891 --> 00:29:30,024
Rym: It was tough, though, because one kid, who obviously was pretty new to anime and was excited, and had only seen, like, a recent anime, was asking, like, "All right, you guys seem to know a lot about

472
00:29:30,086 --> 00:29:30,250
Rym: anime.".

473
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:31,625
Rym: Like, "What shows should I

474
00:29:31,666 --> 00:29:31,969
Rym: watch?".

475
00:29:32,392 --> 00:29:37,645
Rym: And that, it felt real good to give, like, a young kid who doesn't know about, like, "Oh, yeah, Evangelion

476
00:29:37,686 --> 00:29:37,808
Rym: Cup.".

477
00:29:38,092 --> 00:29:40,130
Rym: Like, give them, like, this baseline recommendations.

478
00:29:41,093 --> 00:29:42,310
Rym: But it was very tempting.

479
00:29:42,473 --> 00:29:43,350
Rym: I've restrained myself.

480
00:29:43,591 --> 00:29:46,710
Rym: I did not recommend terrible anime as much as I kind of wanted to.

481
00:29:46,831 --> 00:29:47,101
Scott: Roji!

482
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:49,508
Scott: That's the first anime anyone should see.

483
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:51,650
Rym: Yeah, Roji get Doji Apocalypse Zero.

484
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:52,507
Rym: That's a good show.

485
00:29:54,290 --> 00:30:03,890
Scott: But, yeah, it looks like they've, they had, during the convention, if you were online, it's over now, all of the videos, as soon as after they played, were available as VODs.

486
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:09,950
Scott: So you could go back and watch them, which I think sucks for people who had, like, our friends who had their panel towards the end of the con.

487
00:30:10,451 --> 00:30:13,630
Scott: It was only available online for a very brief time, and then it was gone.

488
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:13,860
Scott: Yep.

489
00:30:14,114 --> 00:30:14,270
Scott: Right?

490
00:30:15,551 --> 00:30:21,170
Rym: It's not clear if they're going to be available at any point in the future from the con, but we're probably going to publish ours on our own YouTube so you can watch it.

491
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:28,830
Scott: Yeah, they can't really stop us, so if they do not put up our video later, we will edit and upload our own video, just because, why not?

492
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:29,200
Scott: Yep.

493
00:30:29,652 --> 00:30:32,804
Rym: I didn't use an overlay or anything, so I might, I could just use the exact version I put up.

494
00:30:33,532 --> 00:30:33,642
Scott: Yep.

495
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:37,650
Scott: So it looks like PAX Online is coming very, very soon, what, like a week?

496
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:47,010
Rym: Yeah, and on Friday, September 18th, our brand new panel that no one has seen before, except me and Scott, and a handful of industry people, where is the finish line?

497
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:56,149
Scott: PAX Online starts on Saturday the 12th, which is this Saturday, and it's going to end on, I guess, Sunday the 20th, I think?

498
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:56,744
Scott: Right?

499
00:30:57,133 --> 00:30:57,445
Rym: It's long.

500
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:58,629
Rym: It's nine days.

501
00:31:00,571 --> 00:31:09,950
Scott: Also, Saturday the 19th, at the same time as PAX Online is getting close to the end, is going to be the GDOC Expo Online, right?

502
00:31:10,432 --> 00:31:17,130
Scott: So you're getting, over the next two weekends, you are going to be up to your eyes in game, online gaming convention.

503
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:38,627
Rym: And then stay tuned for the future, there is going to be an online virtual Super Meg West, like, not Megfest, Meg West, like a mini online version, and we're going to do a, like, rapid fire, 25 minute long version of our Play Dirty to Win/How to Win type panel, so we're going to do a, like, focus distilled version of that that I'm still working out the details on.

504
00:31:39,457 --> 00:31:39,990
Scott: Oh, exciting.

505
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,048
Rym: That'll actually be pretty fun.

506
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:53,090
Rym: And otherwise, like, stay tuned to our stuff, like, follow us on YouTube, join our Discord, we're both streaming games, playing stuff, poking around, we're kind of talking to people more, just because, you know, we're stuck inside, normally we talk to you.

507
00:31:53,650 --> 00:32:03,070
Scott: Yeah, I've been doing the Zwift thing, which is where you bike to nowhere, and there's a little virtual world you're biking in to keep your attention and to help follow a training program of some kind.

508
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:06,890
Scott: And I, you know, I'm not expecting, I don't need Twitch viewers, right?

509
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:09,769
Scott: I'm not trying to do a Twitch thing, I don't give a shit about that, right?

510
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:17,750
Scott: But, you know, it's way easier to bike if there's just one person in the chat room, just one person, just one penny, right?

511
00:32:18,291 --> 00:32:23,667
Scott: So, if you want to talk to me about literally anything, like, yesterday someone was talking to me at, like, MOBAs or something, right?

512
00:32:24,351 --> 00:32:31,050
Scott: Anything you want to talk to me about, just follow me on the Twitch, and then when I'm biking, which I'll probably do after this show, right?

513
00:32:32,171 --> 00:32:36,150
Scott: Just chat with me in that chat box, I'll probably be biking for, like, an hour at a time, maybe.

514
00:32:37,731 --> 00:32:41,949
Scott: Just chat with me about whatever, and just don't be, don't say something awful.

515
00:32:41,989 --> 00:32:43,868
Scott: that means I have to get off my bicycle and ban you.

516
00:32:45,091 --> 00:32:46,509
Scott: Just keep it chill, right?

517
00:32:47,552 --> 00:32:48,748
Rym: Alright, so let's get right into it.

518
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:51,290
Scott: Oh, the book club book is The Tale of Genji.

519
00:32:51,751 --> 00:32:52,608
Scott: I have not read it.

520
00:32:53,030 --> 00:33:00,470
Rym: So, I feel like when I'm going to start reading books again, because I'm not reading books, I'm too busy with this convention chat, like, I'm too busy with gig nights.

521
00:33:01,392 --> 00:33:05,150
Rym: It takes a lot more to do what we do when we can't do it in person.

522
00:33:05,593 --> 00:33:08,570
Rym: It's actually taking a lot of my time to organize this shit.

523
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:10,769
Rym: Also, we're working on some shit we can't talk about yet.

524
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:11,855
Scott: Ooh.

525
00:33:12,711 --> 00:33:18,050
Rym: So, there's a lot going on, but I'm, like, I'm trying to, like, restart that Utena show that I keep trying to restart.

526
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:26,789
Rym: Literally, I was ready to record an episode with Scott, and then COVID happened, so now we have our new pipeline, but it's been so long I've got to watch the episode again, like, there's stuff in the way.

527
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:31,149
Rym: So, reading really took a back burner, and when I'm reading, I'm reading nonfiction right now.

528
00:33:31,571 --> 00:33:36,330
Rym: I'm reading, like, electoral theory and, like, documents and procedures and things.

529
00:33:37,171 --> 00:33:39,142
Scott: Okay, so, main bit.

530
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:40,510
Scott: Here's a deal, right?

531
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:49,190
Scott: Over the last week or so, I saw these people talking about a thing called Logitech Playmaster, the same Logitech that makes the mice and the keyboards and the webcams, right?

532
00:33:49,630 --> 00:34:03,630
Scott: And what this is is a beta program, and the idea behind this program is that you install it, and you, in, like, the Steam Workshop, and it adds to your copy of Counter-Strike GO.

533
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:04,790
Scott: You have to own a copy.

534
00:34:05,932 --> 00:34:13,409
Scott: It adds to your copy some maps and some other stuff, right, from the Steam Workshop, and then you would go to the Playmaster beta website.

535
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:16,230
Scott: When it's running, it's down now, and it's been down before.

536
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:20,810
Rym: I can talk about my scores only because I happened to post a screenshot of when I tried it out.

537
00:34:21,632 --> 00:34:22,416
Scott: Yep, exactly.

538
00:34:23,721 --> 00:34:41,929
Scott: And what it does is something-- I think this isn't the first attempt at this, but I think it's the first, like, big-time attempt, like, at it, to where it is a program that is designed to train you to be better at Counter-Strike GO, right?

539
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:49,489
Scott: It's, like, not-- it's testing you to see how good you are at it, and then providing, like, specific practice.

540
00:34:50,112 --> 00:35:01,690
Rym: Now, things like this have existed before, but they're usually either bespoke, or they exist, like, inside of esports teams or among professionals with fiddly setups.

541
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:05,360
Rym: I have not seen one that was big enough like this.

542
00:35:05,701 --> 00:35:08,270
Rym: that was just, like, mass-market, like, anyone can just use it.

543
00:35:08,631 --> 00:35:10,510
Rym: You don't need, like, to do a bunch of fuckery.

544
00:35:11,013 --> 00:35:12,910
Rym: It did just work, like, when the website was up.

545
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:19,517
Rym: Like, I clicked on a website a bunch, and then it launched Steam and put me into the map with the bot and told me exactly what to do.

546
00:35:19,537 --> 00:35:21,790
Rym: It was actually really, really easy.

547
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:24,930
Scott: Yeah, when the servers are up, it does work really well.

548
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:34,750
Rym: And, like, I used to play seriously, but not, like, super seriously, like, in middle school, high school, like, playing online with people, with clans, but we'd have practices.

549
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:46,530
Rym: Like, training is different from playing, but without tools, setting up training in a esport, especially, like, an FPS esport where there's teams, is really hard to do.

550
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,601
Rym: You need, like, you can't just have your team.

551
00:35:48,903 --> 00:35:50,210
Rym: You need another team to play against.

552
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:53,690
Rym: You need, like, coaches to watch and tell you what to do and come up with drills.

553
00:35:54,130 --> 00:36:00,910
Rym: You need someone whose job is, like, run across this field over and over again while the team tries to kill you.

554
00:36:00,971 --> 00:36:01,669
Rym: Like, that kind of crap.

555
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:09,170
Scott: So, the TLDR on this thing, if anyone wants to turn off now, is that, you know, we've had coaching available for a long time.

556
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:16,710
Scott: If you're willing to pay for it, there are people out there who are willing to coach people at various competitive games, especially PC multiplayer competitive games.

557
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:21,410
Rym: I was thinking about trying out a digital coach for Overwatch for my tanking, like, specifically.

558
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:22,030
Scott: Like a human?

559
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:22,750
Scott: Yeah, a human.

560
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:27,150
Rym: I was thinking about paying a human to do some, like, once a week sessions with me on my tanking.

561
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:38,190
Scott: There are people who have offered that service, but the thing is, until more recently, even those services that provided coaches, they could not provide the gymnasium.

562
00:36:39,972 --> 00:36:40,142
Rym: Right?

563
00:36:41,031 --> 00:36:44,448
Scott: So, it's like, "Oh, great, I hired a coach, and here we are with no equipment and no

564
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:44,669
Scott: gym.".

565
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:44,930
Scott: Right?

566
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:55,130
Scott: So, the way I see this playmaster thing, and we're going to go into detail on it, is just, I think, this is a gymnasium that does not, desperately needs a coach.

567
00:36:55,411 --> 00:36:56,430
Scott: It does not have the coaching.

568
00:36:57,131 --> 00:37:01,130
Rym: I find it does have the coaching in the sense that- It has a very little, it has a very small amount.

569
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:05,890
Scott: Like, they're going to add it, or they're going to add more of it, but as of right now, it's mostly gym.

570
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:15,070
Rym: But what I found was, I did it, and then I did all the challenges one more time, and just by doing the challenges, I got way better at them.

571
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:19,530
Scott: Of course, that, you know, happens, so that's a general thing for most people, right?

572
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:25,310
Scott: Is that, like, you know, you didn't need a coach to, like, no coach, no one coached me on Mega Man 2 when I was a kid.

573
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:25,480
Scott: Yeah.

574
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:25,931
Scott: Right?

575
00:37:26,394 --> 00:37:29,589
Scott: I just played Mega Man 2 a bunch, and I was able to figure things out.

576
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:35,730
Rym: Yeah, but to your point, what it didn't do, like, the spraying one, which I'm fucking garbage at, we'll get into, like, what I'm talking about.

577
00:37:36,051 --> 00:37:36,472
Rym: Fuck that.

578
00:37:37,094 --> 00:37:42,910
Rym: I am so bad at that, it's hilarious, but that's the one where I don't know what to do differently.

579
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:47,590
Rym: And the game doesn't tell me, and everything I do just makes my score worse.

580
00:37:48,350 --> 00:38:06,055
Scott: There are some activities in the world that a human, when trying to get better at, right, can sort of figure out just by doing something a lot, trying different things, seeing what works, seeing what doesn't, trial and error, getting constructive feedback from the activity itself, getting intuitive, right?

581
00:38:06,115 --> 00:38:08,221
Scott: It's like, you know, something like biking.

582
00:38:08,261 --> 00:38:09,544
Scott: It's like, oh, I fall over.

583
00:38:10,106 --> 00:38:11,550
Scott: It's like, I guess that's not how to do it.

584
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:11,762
Scott: Yep.

585
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:15,718
Rym: Or even mountain biking, like, oh, I fall over on these curves.

586
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:17,101
Rym: Oh, well, the curve's banked.

587
00:38:17,121 --> 00:38:18,504
Rym: What if I go up on the curve?

588
00:38:18,525 --> 00:38:20,750
Rym: Oh, okay, like, it's pretty intuitive when you look at it.

589
00:38:21,111 --> 00:38:25,241
Scott: And different people have different abilities to figure out.

590
00:38:25,282 --> 00:38:28,450
Scott: Some people can't intuitively figure out anything, ever, right?

591
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:36,130
Scott: And some people can intuitively figure out things that would not be intuitive to almost anyone else, that you would absolutely need someone to tell you.

592
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:39,490
Scott: But somehow that genius person, you know, just figured it out.

593
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:53,127
Rym: Like, you've ever done martial arts, and it's very rare to find someone who can instruct you in, move exactly like this, do, like, these exact motions to teach you how to do something versus starting to internalize, like, a physicality of it.

594
00:38:53,408 --> 00:38:55,030
Rym: They're different skills and different learning methods.

595
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:57,754
Scott: Right, like, look, martial arts is a great example, right?

596
00:38:57,794 --> 00:39:02,523
Scott: It's like, if you go take lessons in a martial art, right, they show you what to do, right?

597
00:39:02,883 --> 00:39:06,690
Scott: And even if you watch videos of other people doing it, you can try to mimic them, right?

598
00:39:06,991 --> 00:39:11,222
Scott: Imagine trying to learn a martial art just standing there, with no one, just your body.

599
00:39:11,262 --> 00:39:14,170
Scott: You don't need anything else but your body to learn a martial art, right?

600
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:16,274
Scott: Or imagine even if I hand you some nunchucks.

601
00:39:16,294 --> 00:39:20,423
Scott: It's like, go ahead, learn to use the nunchucks, right?

602
00:39:20,463 --> 00:39:23,269
Scott: Can you, would you ever figure out the right, a good way to use them?

603
00:39:23,289 --> 00:39:23,650
Scott: Just holding them?

604
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:28,359
Rym: You know, I've convinced my parents to get, my brother and I both got practice nunchucks as kids.

605
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:33,790
Rym: Those were, the sole use of nunchucks is to hit yourself in the face, and then the dick.

606
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:42,550
Scott: Right, it's like, and you probably, at least, when you had those as kids, you at least had access to videos of Michelangelo using his nunchucks.

607
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:46,050
Rym: Oh yeah, and I tried to do what Michelangelo did, I hit myself right in the dick, immediately.

608
00:39:47,311 --> 00:39:49,710
Rym: Of course, but you could never figure it out from nothing.

609
00:39:49,931 --> 00:39:54,530
Rym: Like, you think I'm joking, like, oh, it's funny to say, no, I hit myself right in the dick and fell over and passed out.

610
00:39:54,710 --> 00:40:01,950
Scott: Hand someone some nunchucks who's never held nunchucks before and say, figure out how to use these, even if you tell them that they're a weapon and they figure that much out.

611
00:40:02,513 --> 00:40:05,469
Scott: It's like, only a Bruce Lee kind of character would, you know.

612
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:11,310
Rym: And that is because for various reasons, some things are not intuitive to humans who don't have specialized training.

613
00:40:12,452 --> 00:40:16,950
Rym: And there's even counterintuitive things, things that feel like, oh, it makes sense to do this.

614
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:25,170
Rym: Like, there's certain ways to ski, if you've never skied, you get in some skis, you might think, oh, I could, like, make a V-shape or turn to my side to stop.

615
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:27,640
Rym: But if you don't actually know what you're doing, those things don't work.

616
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:29,468
Scott: Like, the intuitive answer is the wrong answer.

617
00:40:30,291 --> 00:40:34,550
Scott: Until, like, fifth grade, whenever I made a fist, I put my thumb inside my fist.

618
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:41,545
Scott: And then, not until I had the karate lesson, they were like, take your thumb out of your fist, and I was like, what?

619
00:40:41,646 --> 00:40:43,230
Scott: I didn't understand what the hell they were saying.

620
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:46,238
Scott: And then eventually I figured it out, right?

621
00:40:46,279 --> 00:40:49,230
Scott: I was like, oh, that's what they're saying, I get it now.

622
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:51,570
Rym: My moment was, as a kid, I learned kid taekwondo.

623
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:57,050
Scott: But also, even after I understood what they were saying, my muscle memory, I kept making the wrong fist for, like, weeks.

624
00:40:57,231 --> 00:41:02,070
Rym: When I was a kid learning taekwondo, they taught me to make a fist kind of the right way, but they focused on the punching.

625
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:07,770
Rym: But when I took kung fu, the first day, the teacher's like, the fuck are you doing with your fist?

626
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:10,280
Rym: Because they didn't actually teach me how to make a correct fist.

627
00:41:10,602 --> 00:41:12,590
Rym: It was the little kid, they taught me, like, a good enough fist.

628
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:15,830
Rym: They didn't teach me the technique to make the fist in the first place.

629
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:19,450
Scott: Right, so anyway, so here we have Logitech Playmaster.

630
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:22,890
Scott: So the way this thing works is there are how many different challenges?

631
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:26,870
Rym: Oh, here, I can pull up a screenshot, it's down right now, but I have a screenshot of my own thing.

632
00:41:27,073 --> 00:41:28,090
Scott: I also have screenshots.

633
00:41:28,711 --> 00:41:37,130
Rym: So, they have these named skills, and they are, if you've played Counter-Strike, even, like, a little, most of these, you'll understand what they are.

634
00:41:37,533 --> 00:41:39,110
Scott: Alright, there's eight challenges.

635
00:41:39,671 --> 00:41:43,450
Rym: Hold, track, aim, peek, spray, jump, perceive, flick.

636
00:41:44,250 --> 00:42:02,650
Scott: Okay, so, you go into the application, and it puts you on these pre-constructed Counter-Strike maps, and what you do is you perform this baseline skills test, where for each skill, there's a different map with a different scenario, and it tests your skill in that, you know, in that category.

637
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:04,010
Rym: The design of this is great.

638
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:18,870
Scott: Right, and then, when it's done, right, you then have the option to warm up or practice rookie, advanced, or, you know, expert level testing on those skills.

639
00:42:19,031 --> 00:42:37,090
Scott: So, eight skills times three difficulties, so 24 different challenges you can practice at, and then, you can go back to do the baseline, after you do the practice modes, to try to improve your skills, you would then go back to that baseline test, redo it, and then re-evaluate how much you've improved, right?

640
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:50,750
Scott: So, it's giving you tools, a gymnasium, in which to practice your Counter-Strike skills, and also evaluate whether you're getting better at Counter-Strike in some sort of, you know, objective-ish way, right?

641
00:42:50,750 --> 00:43:00,051
Scott: 'Cause if you just evaluate how good you are at Counter-Strike by playing Counter-Strike, it's like, well, if you happen to be up against pros all the time, it's like, you're gonna die, you're gonna die, you can't tell if you-- Playing

642
00:43:00,071 --> 00:43:03,609
Rym: against botch who scrubs on a good team, on a bad team.

643
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:11,150
Scott: Yeah, you can't necessarily tell if you're really getting better, like, is my aim better, am I moving better, am I, right, you don't know.

644
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:20,510
Rym: More importantly, you'll die, but you don't understand what mistake you made, like, why did I lose this encounter with this other player in this room?

645
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:21,389
Rym: What happened there?

646
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:29,490
Rym: But I look at this, and it's like, oh, because I can't spray for shit, nor am I that good at peeking, that's my problem.

647
00:43:29,931 --> 00:43:34,650
Scott: Okay, so let's talk about the eight different tests, let's talk about the, let's start with Track, I guess.

648
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:39,410
Rym: Alright, so I'm actually ranked way better than the community, this is the one I was actually legit good at.

649
00:43:40,010 --> 00:44:00,450
Scott: Yeah, so the tracking test, the way it works, is you are basically stuck in one spot, right, you can't move very much at all, you can't shoot either, you have a gun and a crosshair, and there's a bad guy, a terrorist, and there's a big open field, and the terrorist runs around the field, and you have to do, is basically keep your cursor, your crosshair, on the terrorist.

650
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:04,230
Rym: Yup, ideally on the head, but anywhere is worth something.

651
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:07,883
Scott: Right, he comes closer, he goes farther, he goes left, he goes right, he jumps--

652
00:44:09,991 --> 00:44:10,331
Rym: Right,

653
00:44:10,591 --> 00:44:26,930
Scott: he crouches, he goes left and right, he goes all over the place, and you just gotta keep your crosshair on him for the whole time, and that's the test, right, so obviously, if you can do this well, you're gonna be good at Counter-Strike, because people who are running all around all over the place are not gonna be able to escape your bullets.

654
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:48,910
Scott: Right, so if you practice doing this, you don't really necessarily, you know, need too much coaching, like you could just intuitively do this, right, and you know, try to adjust things, adjust your mouse sensitivity, move your mouse differently, try to figure it out, and get better at this just by doing it, and that will translate into better Counter-Strike play, and probably better FPS play overall.

655
00:44:48,950 --> 00:45:07,770
Scott: So this is a good test, the thing I think the test could use is, again, like I said before, it would be nice, it basically gives you no explicit advice on how to be better at it, right, so it's like, there's some things, it's like, okay, the guy jumps, I basically always lost the guy when he jumps.

656
00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:12,310
Rym: Yup, I could weirdly, like, predict that they were about to jump pretty accurately and keep it on the head.

657
00:45:12,970 --> 00:45:37,870
Scott: But it's like, you know, okay, well when a guy jumps, what should I, you know, how do I know he's gonna do it, and what's, how, what kind of movement should I make to keep on the guy, right, it's like, or like, is my mouse, tell me if my mouse sensitivity is too high or too low, I didn't get to experiment with it, but like, there's no reason, the app should actually be, it should be possible to write software that would detect, ah, this person's mouse is going all over the place, maybe their sensitivity is too high.

658
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:39,454
Rym: Yeah, I'll bet something like that is coming.

659
00:45:39,794 --> 00:45:46,490
Rym: I did try the advanced training, and the guy runs around way faster, and there's textures where you can walk up and down ramps and stuff too.

660
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:49,549
Scott: Yup, yup, yup, so that's the, that's the tracking test.

661
00:45:49,990 --> 00:46:01,870
Rym: Now that's also the one that was the most transferable, because I found it personally interesting that that's the one I was actually way good at, but that's the skill that is universal to almost all first person shooters with a mouse and keyboard.

662
00:46:02,831 --> 00:46:08,369
Rym: Like, track ahead, track an object, that's what I need in Overwatch for the kinds of characters I play.

663
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:19,109
Scott: I obviously, you know, there are some that are going to be faster or slower than others, right, it's like a fast FPS, tracking is quite different from a slow one.

664
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:23,010
Rym: Yup, also leading versus not leading, hitscan and all that, like.

665
00:46:23,110 --> 00:46:24,889
Scott: Yup, depending on how the bullets work, right.

666
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:26,470
Rym: Yup, this is a tracking hitscan.

667
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:29,149
Scott: In Counter Strike, you wanna keep your crosshair on the bad guy.

668
00:46:29,333 --> 00:46:29,463
Scott: Yup.

669
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:30,469
Scott: Pretty much, right.

670
00:46:31,055 --> 00:46:32,749
Scott: Okay, so you're talking about the aiming test?

671
00:46:33,634 --> 00:46:34,549
Scott: The most boring test?

672
00:46:35,233 --> 00:46:36,289
Rym: I like the aiming test.

673
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:42,270
Scott: I mean, I like, it was fine, but it's not the, it's not, it's like, it's an FPS game, here's the aiming test.

674
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:42,630
Scott: Yup.

675
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:44,330
Scott: Sort of like, the most straightforward.

676
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,829
Rym: I was nearly as good as the community on that one.

677
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:49,209
Scott: So how does the aiming test go?

678
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:59,550
Rym: I'm trying to remember, because the flick one is the sniping one, and the hold one is the other sniping one, and the peek one is you go around the corners and there's guys standing.

679
00:46:59,892 --> 00:47:01,888
Rym: Oh, right, guys just appear around you.

680
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:03,890
Scott: Yeah, it's basically Hogan's Alley.

681
00:47:04,651 --> 00:47:05,249
Scott: It's Hogan's Alley.

682
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:10,990
Scott: So, I did pretty good at this, because the guys aren't shooting me, so they appear.

683
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:12,810
Rym: In Advanced Mode, they shoot at you if you take too long.

684
00:47:13,491 --> 00:47:14,689
Scott: Oh, okay, I didn't do that.

685
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:18,770
Scott: But yeah, guys appear, and I click on their head, so like, I was doing pretty great at that.

686
00:47:18,850 --> 00:47:21,170
Scott: It's like, oh, there's a guy, click on his head, there's a guy, click on his head.

687
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:27,310
Rym: Yup, seems to test a synthesis of reaction time to a stimulus, and tracking over to it to then fire.

688
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:32,330
Scott: Yup, so the good thing here is this test is like it's a Hogan's Alley for Counter Strike.

689
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:37,829
Scott: You can practice with this also pretty well, and I don't think it necessarily needs coaching so much, right?

690
00:47:39,252 --> 00:47:41,970
Rym: What's funny is this is the training I actually do for Overwatch.

691
00:47:42,511 --> 00:47:53,630
Rym: There's a training room, like Overwatch comes with a gymnasium, where there's bots of different kinds doing different looping behaviors, and you can go to different areas of this map to practice whatever thing you want to practice.

692
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:55,540
Scott: I mean, Street Fighter and Smash Bros.

693
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,390
Scott: have training modes, but it doesn't teach you shit.

694
00:47:57,871 --> 00:48:00,050
Scott: It's just like, here's a sandbox, do whatever you want.

695
00:48:00,551 --> 00:48:04,490
Rym: It's more like a parkour gymnasium, where they assume you know what you're doing, like a rock climbing gym.

696
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:05,761
Rym: We assume you know what you're doing, here.

697
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:08,950
Scott: Yeah, it doesn't teach you anything, it doesn't measure anything.

698
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:20,390
Rym: But I'll go in there, like, to warm up, and literally pick a hit stand character, go to an area of the map, and just, like, one, two, three, go, open my eyes, and try to headshot as many guys as I can in one go.

699
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:21,328
Rym: It's a drill I do.

700
00:48:22,436 --> 00:48:24,910
Rym: And this is a really good drill exercise.

701
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:36,310
Scott: So what I learned from the aiming test, which I was about slightly under community skill level at, is that my main problem isn't that I'm bad at aiming, I'm actually quite good at aiming.

702
00:48:37,175 --> 00:48:38,329
Scott: I'm just really slow.

703
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:47,650
Scott: So if you look at my numbers, assuming that it wasn't bugged or something, right, my, like, headshots and accuracy was actually through the roof.

704
00:48:47,911 --> 00:48:52,930
Rym: I was very similar, like, high accuracy, but it took me, like, 1.1 seconds to actually get over there.

705
00:48:53,310 --> 00:48:58,230
Scott: I was at, like, pro level accuracy, assuming that this is correct, right?

706
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:01,498
Scott: Yeah, you, me, hits on target, 80%, 88 out of 110 shots on target.

707
00:49:05,570 --> 00:49:09,471
Scott: It says that professionals only have 60% and the community is 56.

708
00:49:09,471 --> 00:49:14,608
Scott: I don't know if that data's right, but that's crazy that I'm 80% accurate and pros are 60, right?

709
00:49:15,531 --> 00:49:24,390
Scott: The problem is, if you look, it also reports on time to shoot, so how long until I fire the first bullet between when the bad guy appeared and when I clicked the mouse.

710
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:26,608
Rym: And the pros are what, like, 0.67 seconds or something?

711
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:27,572
Scott: Right, right, so hold on.

712
00:49:27,793 --> 00:49:32,930
Scott: The time until my first bullet hits the enemy, and the time until the enemy is dead.

713
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:36,605
Scott: So it took me, my time to shoot is 1.16 seconds.

714
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:41,182
Scott: So about a second, I start shooting, and the bad guy dies at 1.75 seconds.

715
00:49:41,202 --> 00:49:41,382
Scott: 7-4, right?

716
00:49:44,212 --> 00:49:47,480
Scott: Pros, their time to frag is 1.06.

717
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:49,484
Scott: A professional player with 60% accuracy.

718
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:53,820
Scott: So they're not aiming as accurately as I am.

719
00:49:54,201 --> 00:49:54,965
Scott: I'm getting 80% hits, right?

720
00:49:56,370 --> 00:50:04,210
Scott: But they, with those 60% of bullets hitting, they are killing me before I fire my first shot, and that is my Counter-Strike life, right?

721
00:50:04,651 --> 00:50:08,990
Rym: And even if they don't kill you, getting hit disrupts you a little bit and slows you down.

722
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:12,629
Scott: And totally means I'm not gonna get my bullets off, basically.

723
00:50:13,831 --> 00:50:14,031
Scott: Right?

724
00:50:14,492 --> 00:50:21,850
Scott: So that matched, that data, true or not, matched my experience playing Counter-Strike my whole life.

725
00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:23,057
Scott: Is that I'm just too slow.

726
00:50:23,178 --> 00:50:24,870
Scott: I'm dead before I shoot.

727
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:25,250
Rym: Yup.

728
00:50:25,651 --> 00:50:34,290
Rym: So Peek, the next one, was really interesting because this is a skill that I know I'm bad at, and I tried to practice, and I just didn't give a shit anymore.

729
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:40,086
Rym: Because it's highly Counter-Strike, PUBG, like, Valorant specific.

730
00:50:40,147 --> 00:50:41,270
Rym: Like, this is not a thing.

731
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:43,018
Scott: PUBG actually has Leaning, right?

732
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:44,284
Scott: So Counter-Strike doesn't.

733
00:50:44,566 --> 00:50:45,430
Scott: But the Peeking test...

734
00:50:45,850 --> 00:50:54,089
Rym: But it does test the, when you enter a space, either through a door or around a corner, like a breach, this is a real world tactic, too.

735
00:50:55,250 --> 00:51:06,190
Rym: What are the places a head is likely to be, and you have those mapped in your own mind, so that you can very quickly shoot where an enemy appears, without exposing yourself more than you need to.

736
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:10,510
Rym: And ideally, pre-shoot the place that they're most likely to be.

737
00:51:11,152 --> 00:51:17,030
Scott: Yup, so the way this test works is you stand behind a wall, and the wall, you're basically right up against it, just like facing a wall.

738
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:19,398
Scott: You can't see anything, except these two arrows.

739
00:51:19,759 --> 00:51:22,710
Scott: And either the left arrow lights up, or the right arrow lights up.

740
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:26,550
Scott: And it's telling you strafe left or strafe right, because that's where the bad guy's gonna be.

741
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:27,272
Scott: Yup.

742
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:30,810
Scott: So you wait for the arrow to light up, you strafe in the direction indicated.

743
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:33,730
Rym: And the guy might be high or low, like anywhere in this room.

744
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:43,550
Scott: And when you strafe, as soon as you go around the corner, and you hit the edge of the wall, there's going to be a bad guy somewhere out in the playing field, and you have to shoot them, right?

745
00:51:43,870 --> 00:51:45,809
Rym: And it's kill them as fast as possible, that's the goal.

746
00:51:45,950 --> 00:51:56,050
Scott: Right, so this is to practice in Counter-Strike, because, you know, you're playing Counter-Strike, you think there's a bad guy around the corner, and you're gonna strafe out there, and you need to shoot them before they shoot you.

747
00:51:56,611 --> 00:51:57,514
Scott: Right?

748
00:51:57,895 --> 00:51:59,981
Scott: That's basically the game of Counter-Strike, right?

749
00:52:00,042 --> 00:52:02,810
Scott: Is strafe around the corner and try to kill them first.

750
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:03,350
Rym: Yup.

751
00:52:03,491 --> 00:52:03,712
Scott: Right.

752
00:52:04,173 --> 00:52:07,764
Scott: So this is letting you practice that exact thing.

753
00:52:08,005 --> 00:52:09,570
Scott: Strafe around the corner, shoot the guy.

754
00:52:09,771 --> 00:52:11,590
Rym: And this one actually did tell me what I was doing wrong.

755
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:12,609
Scott: Over and over and over again.

756
00:52:12,810 --> 00:52:22,550
Rym: This one gives you more stats, because the thing that I thought was neat, is it gives me time to my first bullet, and time to kill, but also time to counter-strafe.

757
00:52:24,091 --> 00:52:35,470
Rym: And that was key, because it made me realize right away that my main problem is that I pre-shoot, and I'll actually start hitting them pretty well, but I don't counter-strafe quick enough, so I expose myself a lot.

758
00:52:37,531 --> 00:52:39,268
Rym: Like, I expose myself way more than I need to.

759
00:52:40,351 --> 00:52:40,573
Scott: Yup.

760
00:52:41,538 --> 00:52:43,610
Scott: Alright, so the next test is the Spraying test.

761
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:45,136
Rym: 100% Counter-Strike specific.

762
00:52:45,176 --> 00:52:46,962
Rym: This is like, do you want to be a pro at Counter-Strike?

763
00:52:47,243 --> 00:52:49,030
Rym: Otherwise, you don't care about this one.

764
00:52:49,492 --> 00:52:50,155
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

765
00:52:50,216 --> 00:52:52,950
Scott: So the thing with the Spraying test is that I didn't really- I don't know what I'm doing wrong.

766
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:55,650
Scott: I didn't understand it at first.

767
00:52:55,790 --> 00:52:58,790
Rym: Yeah, because I never hold the button down for an entire time.

768
00:52:58,810 --> 00:52:59,572
Scott: I never, right.

769
00:52:59,653 --> 00:53:05,170
Scott: Why would I ever hold the mouse button down and not let go of it, and just spray like a wild person, right?

770
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:10,770
Scott: It's like, I was like, you know, burst firing on the guy, and it wouldn't, the test wouldn't continue.

771
00:53:10,870 --> 00:53:11,660
Rym: I did the same thing.

772
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:12,510
Scott: I didn't get it at first.

773
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:13,894
Scott: And I was like, what is going on here?

774
00:53:13,914 --> 00:53:14,657
Scott: I don't understand.

775
00:53:14,677 --> 00:53:17,787
Scott: I don't know if that caused the test to be.

776
00:53:17,847 --> 00:53:18,810
Scott: report the data to me.

777
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:23,290
Rym: No, because I did it over and over and over again afterward, and my scores just got worse and worse and worse.

778
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:33,456
Scott: So what it wants you to do is hold the mouse button down without letting go, and burst and spray your whole clip into this enemy, who's moving around a little bit, right?

779
00:53:33,957 --> 00:53:39,370
Scott: And get as many of the bullets to go into the enemy as possible while you're just spraying and praying.

780
00:53:39,530 --> 00:53:40,879
Scott: And I'm like, first of all, who does that?

781
00:53:40,939 --> 00:53:42,409
Scott: Why are you encouraging that behavior?

782
00:53:42,791 --> 00:53:47,564
Rym: So I have, when I watch competitive, usually that happens at relatively close range.

783
00:53:47,885 --> 00:53:52,730
Rym: when there's a big firefight, and you're just trying to take someone out and move, like there's, I see it happen.

784
00:53:53,691 --> 00:53:57,910
Rym: It's a skill that Counter-Strike people talk about, but the spray pattern is different for every gun.

785
00:53:59,590 --> 00:53:59,751
Scott: Sure.

786
00:54:00,232 --> 00:54:05,530
Scott: And then, so it's about, you know, moving, you're basically, you know, the recoil forces your bullets to mostly go up.

787
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:15,210
Scott: So you're trying to sort of pull your mouse down while you're holding the mouse button down, to try to keep the bullets going into their body, even though by the end of it, you're aiming at like their feet, right?

788
00:54:15,650 --> 00:54:22,770
Scott: So just doing the test in the baseline test didn't help you at all understand what they want you to do or get better at it.

789
00:54:23,011 --> 00:54:24,868
Rym: I got like a 4 out of 20 on that one, like I was just like pfft.

790
00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:25,992
Scott: Yeah, I got an awful score.

791
00:54:26,413 --> 00:54:32,290
Scott: The, however, if you go into the practice mode outside of the baseline test, it's a little bit different.

792
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:45,010
Scott: They give you a little bit of coaching, in that when you're firing and spraying, these little green and red dots appear, and those green and red dots are sort of showing you, it's not entirely clear what they're showing you.

793
00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:48,250
Rym: I figured it out by going to a third-party resource.

794
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:59,250
Scott: Oh, it feels like what they're, my guess is that they're basically saying, hey, if your cursor had been aiming at this green dot, then that bullet that went way off into the distance would have hit the enemy.

795
00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:00,073
Rym: So here's the deal.

796
00:55:00,556 --> 00:55:03,810
Rym: When you look at your skill, it shows that line pattern.

797
00:55:05,151 --> 00:55:05,868
Scott: Mhm, mhm, mhm.

798
00:55:06,211 --> 00:55:17,025
Rym: You have to, for each gun, memorize the pattern, and the longer you hold down the button, you don't necessarily hold it down the whole time, you have to memorize where to move your mouse on the pattern.

799
00:55:17,065 --> 00:55:18,090
Rym: Every gun has a different pattern.

800
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:25,030
Rym: So, you basically just follow that line over time while you're holding the thing down.

801
00:55:27,171 --> 00:55:32,689
Scott: Yeah, see, if you look at my line, it basically starts at the head, it goes down and to the right, then big left, and then down.

802
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:36,390
Rym: That's the line, that's the perfect line you're trying to mimic with your mouse.

803
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:37,514
Scott: Oh.

804
00:55:38,370 --> 00:55:40,030
Rym: That's the line for that gun.

805
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:43,110
Scott: So for that gun, I want to go down.

806
00:55:43,150 --> 00:55:45,470
Rym: Down a little bit to the right, then way to the left.

807
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:48,630
Scott: And then basically, and then make them dance like I'm the mafia with a Tommy gun.

808
00:55:48,812 --> 00:55:48,985
Scott: Yup.

809
00:55:49,771 --> 00:55:54,305
Rym: And every gun has a different one, like the Negev has like this ridiculous bullshit pattern to memorize.

810
00:55:54,325 --> 00:55:55,730
Rym: that's really, really long and complicated.

811
00:55:56,654 --> 00:55:56,989
Scott: Okay.

812
00:55:57,810 --> 00:55:59,837
Rym: I'll link to this website that's explaining it.

813
00:56:00,219 --> 00:56:03,370
Rym: Good fucking god, do I not care about this.

814
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:05,350
Scott: Alright, let's talk about the next bullshit test.

815
00:56:05,350 --> 00:56:17,410
Rym: But I do want to say, this is because Counter-Strike has a very specific skill that only matters for high skill Counter-Strike play of memorizing these semi-random patterns for the guns.

816
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:20,689
Scott: Just memorize the guns you actually use and don't use a lot of guns.

817
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:21,231
Scott: Yup.

818
00:56:22,057 --> 00:56:23,930
Rym: Actually, the pattern for the Mac-10 is pretty easy.

819
00:56:24,652 --> 00:56:24,893
Scott: Yeah.

820
00:56:25,214 --> 00:56:28,865
Scott: So anyway, the next test is sort of a bullshit test, sort of not, right?

821
00:56:28,905 --> 00:56:30,470
Scott: So, the jumping test.

822
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:43,230
Scott: The jumping test is, I think, good in that the test that they have devised here, if you practice these, it is a really good thing to help you get better at jumping at Counter-Strike.

823
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:44,014
Scott: But that's the key.

824
00:56:44,034 --> 00:56:46,610
Rym: Jumping at Counter-Strike and literally no other game.

825
00:56:47,312 --> 00:56:52,990
Scott: I'm not blaming, I'm not blaming, I mean, this app is supposed to be helping you.

826
00:56:53,511 --> 00:56:55,870
Rym: Yeah, we can't blame it for teaching you Counter-Strike.

827
00:56:56,751 --> 00:56:58,059
Scott: It's trying to teach you Counter-Strike.

828
00:56:58,079 --> 00:56:59,969
Scott: It's not trying to teach you every FPS, right?

829
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:05,930
Scott: But what I think to blame here is just, I blame Counter-Strike for being really having shitty jumping mechanics.

830
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:07,889
Rym: I think the industry term for this is fucky.

831
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:08,774
Scott: Yeah.

832
00:57:09,330 --> 00:57:10,666
Rym: Jumping at Counter-Strike is fucky.

833
00:57:11,751 --> 00:57:15,022
Scott: So even in the most basic tests, I couldn't complete all the jumps.

834
00:57:15,062 --> 00:57:17,350
Scott: I think I did three of the jumps and then I failed all the rest.

835
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:17,711
Rym: Oh my god.

836
00:57:17,731 --> 00:57:19,520
Rym: Weirdly, you know the one I can do with no problem?

837
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:20,204
Rym: Jump around the corner.

838
00:57:20,344 --> 00:57:21,470
Rym: I'm just like, whoop, every time.

839
00:57:21,710 --> 00:57:23,374
Scott: I cannot jump around the corner at all.

840
00:57:23,494 --> 00:57:24,477
Scott: I don't even know how to jump.

841
00:57:24,697 --> 00:57:30,030
Scott: And this is an example of where it's a really good practice environment, but it really needs coaching, right?

842
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:38,790
Scott: It's like, you know, some of the jumps were do the Kung Fu jump where you're sort of jumping from a narrow stick to another narrow stick to another narrow stick, right?

843
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:40,430
Scott: Where like in a Kung Fu movie they're fighting.

844
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:43,570
Scott: Like in Iron Monkey where they're standing on the poles and they're fighting.

845
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:51,230
Rym: At RIT I remember playing a lot of maps where they arm you with knives and it was really just like everybody races through a weird platformer environment.

846
00:57:51,410 --> 00:57:52,930
Scott: Oh, I love those obstacle course ones.

847
00:57:52,990 --> 00:57:59,003
Rym: So I was actually good at all the ones that were jump on rails and jump on like things, but I wasn't good at the like.

848
00:57:59,363 --> 00:58:02,570
Rym: weird high speed jump pattern specific to Counter-Strike.

849
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:03,751
Scott: Exactly.

850
00:58:03,832 --> 00:58:06,136
Scott: So they have you do normal jump.

851
00:58:06,457 --> 00:58:08,441
Scott: They have you do jump and then crouch, right?

852
00:58:08,481 --> 00:58:11,167
Scott: To get onto a little slightly higher spot, right?

853
00:58:11,307 --> 00:58:12,490
Scott: Jump and crouch and get into a hole.

854
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:15,736
Scott: Jump and jumping onto the tiny, tiny platforms.

855
00:58:16,137 --> 00:58:17,841
Scott: At least that test is hard.

856
00:58:17,961 --> 00:58:21,910
Scott: Obviously I failed it every time, but you can understand how to do it, right?

857
00:58:21,970 --> 00:58:26,200
Scott: You can look at it and be like, aha, all right, I just had to jump really precisely, right?

858
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:28,425
Scott: To land on exactly on that narrow spot.

859
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:30,630
Scott: It's nothing, you know, mysterious about it.

860
00:58:30,810 --> 00:58:36,549
Rym: The listener binds jump to mouse wheel down and crouch to space bar to do this so they can kind of bunny hop it.

861
00:58:37,610 --> 00:58:38,031
Scott: Interesting.

862
00:58:39,434 --> 00:58:43,842
Scott: But the thing is when it gets to the later jumps, right?

863
00:58:43,943 --> 00:58:47,650
Scott: Jump around a corner, like around a 90 degree angle.

864
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:55,444
Scott: It's like I could not even like let alone like with enough practice, I could do the jumping onto the narrow platforms, right?

865
00:58:55,525 --> 00:58:56,406
Scott: I know how to do it.

866
00:58:56,446 --> 00:58:58,130
Scott: I just wasn't precise enough to do it.

867
00:58:58,751 --> 00:59:02,897
Scott: I cannot even conceive of how to jump around a 90 degree corner.

868
00:59:03,438 --> 00:59:05,081
Scott: I need instruction.

869
00:59:05,241 --> 00:59:06,302
Scott: Like how is this done?

870
00:59:06,403 --> 00:59:07,885
Scott: Exactly what button do I press?

871
00:59:08,185 --> 00:59:08,506
Scott: When?

872
00:59:08,526 --> 00:59:10,108
Scott: I have no clue.

873
00:59:10,208 --> 00:59:11,170
Scott: I could never figure it out.

874
00:59:11,210 --> 00:59:15,830
Rym: I was able to do it twice, but only twice and I could not describe to you what I did.

875
00:59:16,491 --> 00:59:25,330
Scott: I was able to get closer to it, but I had absolutely no clue how to jump around a 90 degree corner and the app provided no instructions.

876
00:59:25,390 --> 00:59:29,379
Rym: Interestingly on this app, that's the thing the community is the best at.

877
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:34,590
Rym: Even though it probably only matters in highly situational things.

878
00:59:35,131 --> 00:59:44,690
Scott: And what's interesting is that in a lot of other FPSs when there's platforming sections like Doom Eternal or in Half Life 1, Half Life 2, I'm actually pretty good at that.

879
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:45,971
Scott: Right?

880
00:59:45,991 --> 00:59:48,253
Scott: So this is like on another level beyond that.

881
00:59:48,553 --> 01:00:03,730
Rym: Not to complain about Counter Strike, but just in terms of this app, this is the kind of training tool that would be great for MOBAs and for other games that have non-intuitive things that you need to be good at to achieve high skill levels.

882
01:00:04,031 --> 01:00:07,750
Scott: I agree, but you'd need to add that last element of instruction.

883
01:00:07,890 --> 01:00:11,690
Rym: But imagine if you had this with instruction for how to do Street Fighter shit.

884
01:00:12,511 --> 01:00:13,950
Scott: Oh man, I'd be good at Street Fighter.

885
01:00:14,391 --> 01:00:19,330
Rym: Alright, we're going to learn how to do Hadoken perfectly and here's a training simulator to make this happen.

886
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:20,331
Scott: Exactly.

887
01:00:20,471 --> 01:00:31,448
Scott: And not just, because Street Fighter again provides you with a gymnasium, the training room in Street Fighter 4 and newer versions has a training room, but it does not provide good enough or any instruction at all.

888
01:00:31,708 --> 01:00:32,990
Scott: pretty much that's meaningful.

889
01:00:34,010 --> 01:00:37,857
Rym: So the perceived test was the coolest and I was okay at it.

890
01:00:38,317 --> 01:00:45,930
Rym: I did way better when I tried it the second time because I thought we had to tell vertical and horizontal and I couldn't because you can't.

891
01:00:46,031 --> 01:00:47,129
Scott: I think it's only horizontal.

892
01:00:47,370 --> 01:00:49,553
Rym: It is only horizontal, but I kept trying to aim up.

893
01:00:49,573 --> 01:00:53,678
Rym: So the first time I did it, I did like miserably, but the second time I was pretty good.

894
01:00:53,698 --> 01:01:02,730
Rym: Like I was more than half the time I would be exactly right, but like a third of the time I would be like 20 degrees off.

895
01:01:03,513 --> 01:01:03,714
Scott: Right.

896
01:01:04,076 --> 01:01:06,549
Scott: I did awfully at this, right, but I can't.

897
01:01:06,930 --> 01:01:07,759
Scott: I did better than you.

898
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:08,750
Rym: I did look at your score.

899
01:01:09,151 --> 01:01:18,350
Scott: I'm not going to blame it on the headphones because I don't have enough evidence to tell whether I'm bad at it or whether it was the fact that I was just using, you know, open ear stereo headphones.

900
01:01:18,530 --> 01:01:20,008
Rym: I was also using open ear, eh.

901
01:01:20,690 --> 01:01:20,851
Scott: Right.

902
01:01:21,232 --> 01:01:25,622
Scott: Everything either sounded like it was coming from straight ahead, straight back, left or right.

903
01:01:25,702 --> 01:01:28,830
Scott: I could not tell any other directionality.

904
01:01:29,533 --> 01:01:33,387
Scott: And I remember back in the day when I played Counter Strike, I had 4.1 surround sound.

905
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:34,630
Scott: I remember that.

906
01:01:34,870 --> 01:01:42,290
Scott: And I was actually, and in those days I was actually, I remember pretty good at telling which direction Bullet Fire was coming from.

907
01:01:42,310 --> 01:01:42,671
Scott: You were.

908
01:01:42,732 --> 01:01:43,374
Scott: That's not a lie.

909
01:01:43,394 --> 01:01:44,016
Rym: I remember that.

910
01:01:44,057 --> 01:01:44,880
Rym: You were better at that.

911
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:47,570
Rym: You would like, you would pre-shoot me when we played sometimes.

912
01:01:47,950 --> 01:01:52,280
Scott: So before taking this test, I was thinking, this is my test, the one I'm going to be good at.

913
01:01:52,321 --> 01:01:53,243
Scott: Not like all these other ones.

914
01:01:53,283 --> 01:01:54,325
Scott: I know I suck at, right?

915
01:01:54,726 --> 01:01:56,150
Scott: But I actually was garbage at it.

916
01:01:56,450 --> 01:02:07,330
Scott: So I don't want to blame the headphone because I want someone else to come and do the test with my setup when it's safe to do so, you know, and then compare and be like, aha, it was the headphone or no, I just suck.

917
01:02:07,770 --> 01:02:15,950
Scott: I'd also like to have me, I could also, instead of doing that, I could retake the test with either a surround sound setup or surround sound headphones.

918
01:02:15,950 --> 01:02:17,114
Rym: So I did retake this one.

919
01:02:17,134 --> 01:02:22,430
Rym: And what I noticed was once I realized I didn't have to aim vertical, like it was only horizontal, I did way better.

920
01:02:22,891 --> 01:02:25,937
Rym: Not great, like I'm way worse than the community, but I was better than you.

921
01:02:26,378 --> 01:02:31,890
Rym: But what I found was that my problem is that I'm actually really accurate, but I'm slow with this.

922
01:02:32,831 --> 01:02:33,716
Scott: I'm slow with everything.

923
01:02:33,796 --> 01:02:35,344
Scott: There's nothing I was fast at.

924
01:02:35,364 --> 01:02:36,268
Scott: Nothing was I fast.

925
01:02:36,730 --> 01:02:45,170
Rym: My average error was 11 degrees, which was pretty good, but I was way too slow at getting there because I'd sweep back and forth while the sound was still happening to kind of zoom in on it.

926
01:02:45,992 --> 01:02:47,516
Scott: I would also try to do that.

927
01:02:47,656 --> 01:02:53,110
Scott: I was moving the mouse and I would hear when it would switch from the right ear to the left ear and I'd be like, bam.

928
01:02:53,870 --> 01:03:02,190
Rym: But this was the coolest test, especially because when I'm doing the training, once I shoot, then it shows where the guy was.

929
01:03:02,632 --> 01:03:05,930
Rym: And every now and then I'd be like right on his head and that felt so good.

930
01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:10,090
Scott: When you're doing the baseline test, it plays a noise, you shoot into the darkness.

931
01:03:10,090 --> 01:03:11,690
Rym: It gives you no feedback on how good you're doing.

932
01:03:12,151 --> 01:03:18,630
Scott: And then it's like, OK, and it plays another noise and you shoot into the darkness and you're basically trying to shoot wherever the noise you believe was coming from.

933
01:03:19,051 --> 01:03:25,530
Scott: And then the actual training, it will, after you fire into the darkness, it will show you where the enemy actually was.

934
01:03:26,051 --> 01:03:34,070
Scott: And by seeing that and matching it up with what you just heard, you can gradually sort of get a feel for what sounds like which direction.

935
01:03:34,392 --> 01:03:37,089
Scott: And it forces you to recenter yourself after every test.

936
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:38,569
Rym: Yeah, which helps.

937
01:03:38,790 --> 01:03:39,890
Scott: That's very interesting.

938
01:03:40,295 --> 01:03:41,450
Rym: But yeah, I like that one a lot.

939
01:03:41,690 --> 01:03:47,890
Rym: So flick I was bad at, even though I know I am good at flicking and other FPSs.

940
01:03:48,850 --> 01:03:52,349
Scott: Yeah, spray, jump and perceive I was garbage at.

941
01:03:53,451 --> 01:03:54,370
Scott: Yeah, I'm looking at my test.

942
01:03:54,832 --> 01:03:56,510
Scott: I'm making sure I was looking at someone else's results.

943
01:03:57,310 --> 01:04:00,150
Rym: Track and hold, I was better than the community.

944
01:04:00,950 --> 01:04:03,510
Scott: Yeah, flick is the only one I was better than the community.

945
01:04:03,630 --> 01:04:04,210
Rym: Which I was garbage at.

946
01:04:04,251 --> 01:04:05,709
Scott: And only by a tiny, tiny bit.

947
01:04:06,651 --> 01:04:10,649
Rym: Flick is that, like, head appears, you move the mouse to it quickly and get it.

948
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:13,330
Scott: Right, the last two tests are sniping tests, right?

949
01:04:13,430 --> 01:04:16,590
Scott: So flick is you're zoomed in, a head appears, click on it.

950
01:04:16,871 --> 01:04:18,049
Scott: A head appears, click on it, right?

951
01:04:18,110 --> 01:04:19,863
Scott: With an AWP, so you got one shot.

952
01:04:21,192 --> 01:04:21,567
Scott: And that's it.

953
01:04:22,030 --> 01:04:24,870
Scott: You can't, you know, keep firing at it or anything.

954
01:04:24,950 --> 01:04:28,070
Rym: With flick, the problem was I'm just way too slow.

955
01:04:28,150 --> 01:04:32,150
Rym: But I think, honestly, my problem here is that I play so much Overwatch.

956
01:04:32,713 --> 01:04:36,290
Rym: And you can customize the mouse sensitivity per character.

957
01:04:36,811 --> 01:04:41,690
Rym: So I have a special mouse sensitivity just for the sniper characters.

958
01:04:42,991 --> 01:04:51,965
Scott: So I think the reason I got a higher score on this, right, is that if you look again, my accuracy was 81% hits on target, right?

959
01:04:53,811 --> 01:04:56,350
Scott: So, and the pros had 79%.

960
01:04:56,350 --> 01:05:01,950
Scott: So when it came to sniping, right, I was hitting all the guys, like, almost all of them.

961
01:05:02,391 --> 01:05:06,088
Scott: But my time to frag was 1.07 seconds.

962
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:10,706
Scott: The community, the time it takes them to shoot is 0.78 seconds.

963
01:05:11,810 --> 01:05:15,310
Scott: So basically what that means is that I'm up again.

964
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:18,290
Scott: And the pros weren't actually that much faster than the community.

965
01:05:18,390 --> 01:05:19,020
Scott: They were only 0.6 seconds.

966
01:05:19,971 --> 01:05:21,350
Scott: But they hit the head more often.

967
01:05:22,110 --> 01:05:25,870
Scott: Sure, but the pros only had 0.2 seconds on the community.

968
01:05:26,293 --> 01:05:28,590
Scott: I'm 0.2 seconds slower than the community.

969
01:05:28,890 --> 01:05:32,689
Scott: So the gap in speed between pros and the community is the same for me.

970
01:05:33,111 --> 01:05:40,387
Scott: So what this means is that in an actual game of Counter-Strike, right, obviously you can't reload the one-shot sniper rifle in 0.2 seconds.

971
01:05:41,430 --> 01:05:49,790
Scott: But if I'm up against an average opponent, within, before I fire my bullet, they are going to fire their bullet.

972
01:05:50,373 --> 01:05:52,630
Scott: And they will have a 60% chance of killing me.

973
01:05:52,650 --> 01:05:53,761
Rym: But if they don't kill you...

974
01:05:54,690 --> 01:05:59,210
Scott: If they don't kill me, that means, so 40% of the time, I'm going to get to shoot.

975
01:06:00,090 --> 01:06:04,704
Scott: And in that 40% of the time that I get to shoot, I will kill them 80% of the time, right?

976
01:06:06,930 --> 01:06:12,010
Scott: So it's 40 times 0.8 is whatever percentage time I'm going to win.

977
01:06:12,712 --> 01:06:15,150
Scott: And that remaining percentage, we both reload.

978
01:06:15,650 --> 01:06:20,929
Scott: And then we would multiply again that remaining percentage by, you know, so diminishing returns.

979
01:06:21,432 --> 01:06:29,910
Scott: So approximately 0.4 times 0.8% I'm going to win, even though I'm more accurate than professional players.

980
01:06:30,931 --> 01:06:32,210
Rym: I do enjoy a sniper duel.

981
01:06:32,650 --> 01:06:37,310
Rym: But yeah, you would probably beat me in a sniper duel, because this is not, in Counter-Strike especially, not good at this.

982
01:06:37,950 --> 01:06:39,270
Rym: I don't think there's coaching.

983
01:06:39,590 --> 01:06:42,850
Rym: Like, training is necessary to get better at this, but I can't imagine coaching.

984
01:06:43,070 --> 01:06:44,818
Scott: Yeah, there's no information.

985
01:06:44,898 --> 01:06:47,390
Scott: you need to do better at this, right?

986
01:06:47,410 --> 01:07:01,230
Rym: Except maybe a coach might be able to tell you about alternate methods, because there's the sweep and click method, there's the flick and click, there's the change your bindings to where you click, and then let go.

987
01:07:01,590 --> 01:07:03,129
Rym: Like, there's different ways to approach this.

988
01:07:03,671 --> 01:07:04,718
Scott: I had no method.

989
01:07:04,839 --> 01:07:08,790
Scott: All I did was wait for the guy to appear, move my mouse onto him, and then click.

990
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:16,650
Rym: Ah, so when I snipe in real games, what I tend to do in, like, Overwatch sniping is I'll sweep my cursor around.

991
01:07:16,810 --> 01:07:19,430
Rym: Like, I'll just be sweeping it around the area that I'm looking for people.

992
01:07:19,772 --> 01:07:21,870
Rym: And if I see a head, I don't try to flick to it.

993
01:07:22,171 --> 01:07:27,390
Rym: I continue my sweep pattern, and then when I'm approaching them, I flick toward their head at the last second.

994
01:07:28,772 --> 01:07:30,002
Rym: I can't do that in Counter-Strike.

995
01:07:30,043 --> 01:07:30,910
Rym: It's a totally different game.

996
01:07:31,230 --> 01:07:34,910
Rym: And also, I've always been a fucking garbage sniper in Counter-Strike, so this just confirmed it.

997
01:07:35,433 --> 01:07:37,970
Scott: So the final test, my worst one, I think.

998
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:38,536
Scott: Really?

999
01:07:38,617 --> 01:07:39,710
Rym: This was my second best one.

1000
01:07:40,011 --> 01:07:40,312
Scott: I don't know.

1001
01:07:40,352 --> 01:07:48,730
Scott: Actually, the game, if you look at the skill radar, it doesn't suggest that I'm that bad at this test.

1002
01:07:48,790 --> 01:07:52,370
Scott: But if you look at the speed and percentage numbers, I think I'm awful at it, right?

1003
01:07:52,410 --> 01:07:54,090
Scott: So this is the holding test.

1004
01:07:54,270 --> 01:07:57,950
Scott: So this is very similar to the very first test, right?

1005
01:07:58,634 --> 01:07:59,849
Scott: The difference is that you're sniping.

1006
01:08:00,090 --> 01:08:05,830
Scott: So basically, there's a big field, and it tells you when bad guys are going to appear.

1007
01:08:06,432 --> 01:08:08,909
Scott: And a guy comes out, runs around, and then hides again.

1008
01:08:09,693 --> 01:08:18,170
Scott: And you're supposed to zoom in your sniper rifle to the correct zoom level, and keep your crosshair on the guy while they're moving, and also kill them.

1009
01:08:18,550 --> 01:08:18,831
Rym: Yep.

1010
01:08:19,051 --> 01:08:22,868
Rym: It's very much a "control this lane with your sniper

1011
01:08:22,929 --> 01:08:23,149
Rym: rifle.".

1012
01:08:23,149 --> 01:08:23,331
Rym: Right.

1013
01:08:23,814 --> 01:08:26,790
Scott: So the sniper rifle flick test, you're shooting stationary targets.

1014
01:08:26,890 --> 01:08:29,270
Scott: Like, they pop up, like sort of whack 'em all, right?

1015
01:08:29,270 --> 01:08:30,363
Scott: Like, it pops up, shoot 'em.

1016
01:08:30,403 --> 01:08:30,950
Scott: They're not moving.

1017
01:08:31,371 --> 01:08:32,819
Scott: Here, a guy comes out.

1018
01:08:32,859 --> 01:08:34,609
Scott: You know where he's coming from?

1019
01:08:34,729 --> 01:08:36,915
Scott: It's like, they'll signal, like, "This wall!

1020
01:08:37,015 --> 01:08:38,705
Scott: A guy is coming from behind this wall!

1021
01:08:38,746 --> 01:08:38,907
Scott: Get

1022
01:08:38,947 --> 01:08:39,207
Scott: ready!".

1023
01:08:39,731 --> 01:08:43,310
Scott: And a guy comes, and you gotta shoot him while he's running around, before he hides again.

1024
01:08:44,631 --> 01:08:47,444
Scott: I hit 56% on target.

1025
01:08:47,524 --> 01:08:48,810
Scott: I can't hit things that move.

1026
01:08:48,910 --> 01:08:52,710
Rym: I can hit, like, 90% of them, but I tend to hit them-- The pros hit 90%.

1027
01:08:52,710 --> 01:08:53,830
Rym: But I tend to hit them pretty late.

1028
01:08:54,770 --> 01:08:55,279
Rym: I'm slow.

1029
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:55,888
Scott: I'm real slow.

1030
01:08:56,010 --> 01:08:56,814
Scott: Yeah, my speed.

1031
01:08:57,096 --> 01:08:58,666
Scott: My time to shoot was 0.5 seconds.

1032
01:08:59,630 --> 01:09:01,196
Scott: The community was 0.42, and the pros were half.

1033
01:09:01,196 --> 01:09:01,237
Scott: 0.23.

1034
01:09:01,237 --> 01:09:01,759
Scott: Less than half.

1035
01:09:04,689 --> 01:09:07,689
Rym: I tried the advanced test on this, and I was able to hit, like, all but two.

1036
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:17,990
Scott: Yeah, I hit 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and I missed 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

1037
01:09:17,990 --> 01:09:20,870
Rym: But this is where coaching would help, because there's different techniques here.

1038
01:09:21,010 --> 01:09:36,510
Rym: Like, my technique is more reliable in terms of hitting, but way slow, and probably wouldn't work in a real game, because I basically hold the cursor at a point, and I know the guy's coming, and I time, and I wait, and when he's running, I never move a cursor.

1039
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:38,388
Rym: I hit click when I know it'll hit him.

1040
01:09:40,095 --> 01:09:41,049
Rym: I don't move the cursor at all.

1041
01:09:42,290 --> 01:09:50,020
Scott: I did really awful at the tests that involved, you know, keeping the cursor on something, the hold one and the other one.

1042
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:52,069
Scott: That was the first one.

1043
01:09:52,210 --> 01:09:56,010
Rym: And I did really bad at move the cursor to hit something, or peek.

1044
01:09:56,590 --> 01:09:57,847
Rym: Like, move a cursor to hit something.

1045
01:09:58,130 --> 01:10:00,323
Scott: And of course, spray, jump, and perceive.

1046
01:10:00,343 --> 01:10:01,510
Scott: I did work really bad also.

1047
01:10:01,952 --> 01:10:09,688
Rym: But I guess the thing that, like, what this really, if you're thinking, we've talked about this in our panels before, like, in the Play Dirty Wind panel, we also have the slides about it.

1048
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:14,390
Rym: The difference between playing, training, and coaching.

1049
01:10:14,951 --> 01:10:21,490
Rym: This game is a training gym, which you need if you want to get better, like, seriously better at games.

1050
01:10:21,650 --> 01:10:26,890
Rym: Very few players, I think, have the discipline to try to train in a normal game.

1051
01:10:26,950 --> 01:10:28,728
Rym: You need, like, an environment to set that up.

1052
01:10:29,831 --> 01:10:34,688
Rym: Also, if you're training in a normal game with other people who aren't training, you're just a dick, and you're probably making it not fun for them.

1053
01:10:35,694 --> 01:10:35,926
Rym: Yeah.

1054
01:10:36,372 --> 01:10:37,079
Rym: Like, no, no, I'm not.

1055
01:10:37,119 --> 01:10:38,150
Rym: I'm just trying to get headshots.

1056
01:10:38,897 --> 01:10:39,930
Rym: I'm not trying to catch the flag.

1057
01:10:41,090 --> 01:10:55,910
Scott: Yeah, just, you know, a lot of other sport activities have training programs that involve in-person coaching, and also just, you can just get, like, DVDs that, like, give you, you know, you watch videos of, like, how to be, throw a baseball better or whatever, right?

1058
01:10:55,971 --> 01:10:59,770
Rym: This is where you can train without coaching, and you can be coached without training.

1059
01:10:59,950 --> 01:11:10,189
Rym: I think the thing that this could teach a lot of Counter-Strike players, especially Scrubs, Scrubs, if you're a Scrub, and if you're thinking, "Oh, I'm not a Scrub.

1060
01:11:10,530 --> 01:11:11,178
Rym: Everyone else is just

1061
01:11:11,218 --> 01:11:11,542
Rym: better."

1062
01:11:11,562 --> 01:11:12,250
Rym: You're probably a Scrub.

1063
01:11:12,430 --> 01:11:18,250
Rym: But anyway, Scrubs tend to play, and they mistake playing for training.

1064
01:11:18,430 --> 01:11:20,790
Rym: They don't actually train, so they never get better.

1065
01:11:21,470 --> 01:11:23,389
Rym: Very few people will get better from play alone.

1066
01:11:25,192 --> 01:11:36,390
Scott: Yeah, but for esports, right, training, and especially coaching, but training also has been largely not a lot of, not available or accessible to most players, right?

1067
01:11:36,430 --> 01:11:50,810
Scott: It's like, if you want to get better at Counter-Strike, it's like you can read some strategies, but it's like, if you don't have, like, a community of players, like, helping you or something, it's like, it's very, very difficult to get better, because you just don't know how to get better.

1068
01:11:50,910 --> 01:11:51,557
Scott: No one helps you.

1069
01:11:51,638 --> 01:11:52,609
Scott: The game doesn't help you.

1070
01:11:52,991 --> 01:11:57,777
Scott: The tutorials in games just get you up to speed on how to play, and then they're just like, "Okay,

1071
01:11:57,797 --> 01:11:58,019
Scott: bye.".

1072
01:11:58,463 --> 01:11:58,645
Scott: Right?

1073
01:11:58,665 --> 01:11:59,149
Scott: That's the end.

1074
01:11:59,690 --> 01:12:09,910
Scott: There's no advanced skills, nothing that tries to, and even after a tutorial teaches you how to play, almost nothing teaches you how to play well, right?

1075
01:12:10,371 --> 01:12:10,875
Scott: "How do I do?

1076
01:12:11,016 --> 01:12:12,586
Scott: All right, you taught me how to jump as

1077
01:12:12,647 --> 01:12:13,009
Scott: Mario.".

1078
01:12:13,130 --> 01:12:13,613
Scott: Push A.

1079
01:12:13,875 --> 01:12:14,963
Scott: "Can you tell me how to jump

1080
01:12:15,225 --> 01:12:15,507
Scott: better?"

1081
01:12:16,030 --> 01:12:16,312
Scott: Right?

1082
01:12:16,593 --> 01:12:17,901
Scott: "How do I get better at jumping?

1083
01:12:17,942 --> 01:12:18,787
Scott: I learned how to do

1084
01:12:18,847 --> 01:12:18,887
Scott: it.".

1085
01:12:19,430 --> 01:12:19,671
Scott: Right.

1086
01:12:20,033 --> 01:12:20,917
Scott: There's no such thing.

1087
01:12:20,977 --> 01:12:44,205
Scott: So, this is great in that it is, I think, you know, it's not necessarily the first, but the same way that the iPhone was not the first smartphone, it's sort of like, I think, the first real big attempt at not just FPS, but I think esports in general, of making a digital training practice gym program, right, for people to level up.

1088
01:12:44,306 --> 01:12:45,030
Scott: It's not perfect.

1089
01:12:45,151 --> 01:12:52,447
Scott: Like I said, it largely lacks the coaching aspect of telling you what you need to do to improve when the game itself is not enough, right?

1090
01:12:52,950 --> 01:13:01,990
Rym: And even like the website I'll link to that's showing all these spray patterns, like it shows the exact spray patterns, explains everything, but there's no way to play and know if you're doing it right.

1091
01:13:03,570 --> 01:13:03,912
Scott: Exactly.

1092
01:13:03,952 --> 01:13:04,496
Scott: Exactly.

1093
01:13:04,516 --> 01:13:05,260
Scott: Right?

1094
01:13:05,481 --> 01:13:10,602
Scott: So, this is providing a lot, not all the essential tools that are needed, but it's a long way there.

1095
01:13:10,703 --> 01:13:11,710
Scott: It's in the right direction.

1096
01:13:12,132 --> 01:13:14,329
Scott: It's still beta, so there's still a lot going on.

1097
01:13:14,591 --> 01:13:15,749
Rym: I'm having a lot of fun with it.

1098
01:13:16,376 --> 01:13:17,750
Scott: Yeah, this is really exciting.

1099
01:13:18,050 --> 01:13:25,670
Scott: Even if you have no interest in getting better at Counter-Strike, this kind of thing, if it does well, seeing this for all sorts of other esports.

1100
01:13:25,850 --> 01:13:28,569
Rym: I would pay a lot of money for an Overwatch version of this.

1101
01:13:29,210 --> 01:13:31,108
Scott: Yeah, it's like Rocket League could use some of this.

1102
01:13:31,752 --> 01:13:33,290
Scott: Fighting games need this badly.

1103
01:13:33,531 --> 01:13:35,089
Scott: RTS games need this badly.

1104
01:13:35,451 --> 01:13:36,769
Scott: MOBAs need this very badly.

1105
01:13:38,151 --> 01:13:39,990
Scott: You know, anything along these lines.

1106
01:13:40,050 --> 01:13:51,389
Rym: Anything that is an e-sport that is not just a turn-based game, like a sport where reaction times and muscle memory and practice and training are literally the only ways to get better after a certain point.

1107
01:13:52,230 --> 01:13:52,391
Scott: Right.

1108
01:13:52,411 --> 01:14:09,870
Scott: Even if you look at things like speedrunning, if you look at Link to the Past randomizer, they've made all sorts of ROM hacks and things to let you practice fighting bosses and things like that, but they have not developed tools of this nature that will let you know whether you're doing it right or wrong.

1109
01:14:10,110 --> 01:14:11,870
Scott: They've provided this sort of way.

1110
01:14:11,931 --> 01:14:20,210
Scott: It's like, okay, you load up Link to the Past, we'll let you have any item combination, and you can load yourself into any room to practice anything you want to practice, right?

1111
01:14:20,691 --> 01:14:33,009
Scott: And even for the logic, it's like, okay, we made a tool online that will randomize a game, and without actually playing the game, just clicking on things, you pretend you're playing the game, and you learn the logic of where items can be.

1112
01:14:33,530 --> 01:14:42,727
Scott: But there's nothing that helps you get better and gives you advice short of just watching pros and learning from them, right?

1113
01:14:43,390 --> 01:14:48,650
Rym: But a lot of times, pros will be doing these microstrategies, or things that you couldn't see from watching.

1114
01:14:49,050 --> 01:14:52,050
Rym: Like, you see them bonk a hammer twice and stand a weird way.

1115
01:14:52,190 --> 01:14:53,341
Rym: Like, what exactly are they doing?

1116
01:14:53,382 --> 01:14:56,204
Rym: Someone has to explain to you, "Oh, I'm doing this to line up this pixel because of

1117
01:14:56,244 --> 01:14:56,587
Rym: reasons.".

1118
01:14:57,252 --> 01:14:59,050
Scott: Right, and it's like, well, which pixel, right?

1119
01:14:59,090 --> 01:15:09,010
Scott: It's like, they describe the pixel, and they show you a JPEG, and they highlight the pixel, and it's like, but then you go to play, that highlight's not there when you're playing, and it's like, am I in the right pixel or not, right?

1120
01:15:09,010 --> 01:15:09,433
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

1121
01:15:09,453 --> 01:15:11,570
Scott: You've got to have someone watching your stream telling you.

1122
01:15:11,730 --> 01:15:12,664
Scott: You need something like that, right?

1123
01:15:13,310 --> 01:15:27,950
Scott: So just imagine, you know, for any sort of competitive digital gaming, this is the right direction we need to go in and go even further in terms of tooling for improving the competitive skills of players.

1124
01:15:28,131 --> 01:15:38,170
Scott: And I think as more tools like this come out and become widely available, I think you can see just the player base in general, because it seems like a lot of people are using this.

1125
01:15:38,210 --> 01:15:41,310
Scott: Their servers are getting hammered, unless they're lying about that.

1126
01:15:41,410 --> 01:15:41,470
Scott: The

1127
01:15:41,490 --> 01:16:03,850
Rym: player base will grow, and I think this kind of thing can reduce, I think it'll actually make more people play these games competitively and enjoy themselves, because you can learn fundamentals without feeling embarrassed, without having to deal with a team you've let down, like all those other intangibles that drive people away from games like Overwatch or Counter-Strike.

1128
01:16:04,473 --> 01:16:07,629
Rym: This is a safe place to gain those skills without pissing everybody off.

1129
01:16:08,370 --> 01:16:22,509
Scott: Yeah, I don't know if they're lying or if they've filled their database with other data or fake data that they got from somewhere else, but if all the data in the Playmaster database is from actual people using this, there are tens of thousands of people using this.

1130
01:16:22,891 --> 01:16:26,310
Rym: Yep, and I am in the top 39% of all people in this.

1131
01:16:26,470 --> 01:16:31,489
Scott: Which is huge, by the way, and that bodes really well.

1132
01:16:32,132 --> 01:16:39,343
Scott: I could see the player bases of many games just getting way better, which is great for any competitive game.

1133
01:16:40,230 --> 01:16:48,470
Rym: If all the bronze players in Overwatch got good enough to be silver, silver would be a lot more fun, and then the silver people join gold, and I'll just have more fun playing with better players.

1134
01:16:48,830 --> 01:16:53,770
Scott: That just elevates, that just helps everyone in a competitive game community.

1135
01:16:54,251 --> 01:16:56,329
Scott: Everyone is just suddenly better at the game.

1136
01:16:57,530 --> 01:17:05,070
Scott: Even if a significant portion, not even everyone, but just a large enough portion of the player base just gets better at the game, that just elevates everybody.

1137
01:17:05,250 --> 01:17:08,510
Rym: It might save some scrubs, too, because scrubs always think it's not their fault.

1138
01:17:08,890 --> 01:17:12,450
Rym: They're in low silver because they suck, but they think it's always because their team sucks.

1139
01:17:12,911 --> 01:17:28,628
Rym: If they go in here, this is a theoretically objective measure that will tell just them, it won't publicly shame them, they won't have to deal with the world knowing that they actually suck, but they'll be by themselves, they'll see these numbers, and the numbers say, "Yo, kid, you're not actually good at this

1140
01:17:28,668 --> 01:17:28,910
Rym: game.".

1141
01:17:29,291 --> 01:17:32,379
Scott: But I think it could also be good for games that people play and then leave.

1142
01:17:36,730 --> 01:17:50,070
Scott: If you have programs like this, people who play a fighting game, get dismayed and quit, might do a training program like this, get good enough at the fighting game to no longer be dismayed, and once they get over that initial hump, now they're a player.

1143
01:17:50,370 --> 01:18:03,310
Scott: So games that are competitive and skill-based could develop something like this, might just have a larger player base from less abandonment by people who get discouraged by getting their ass handed to them right away.

1144
01:18:03,450 --> 01:18:05,870
Rym: Well, that is the model of all sports.

1145
01:18:06,191 --> 01:18:07,970
Rym: People who play sports, they go to training camps.

1146
01:18:08,610 --> 01:18:09,790
Rym: Like, skiing, I take lessons.

1147
01:18:10,070 --> 01:18:13,150
Rym: I've taken a shit-ton of lessons over the course of my life on how to ski.

1148
01:18:13,330 --> 01:18:17,310
Rym: I'll go and do drills with classes and take clinics and things.

1149
01:18:18,010 --> 01:18:20,530
Rym: Esports, this is another part of the maturity model of esports.

1150
01:18:21,371 --> 01:18:23,630
Scott: So Logitech Playmaster is very exciting.

1151
01:18:23,710 --> 01:18:29,150
Scott: I hope this itself goes further than it is now, because it is still lacking in some areas.

1152
01:18:29,310 --> 01:18:32,210
Rym: I would recommend you try it, even if you have no interest in Counter-Strike.

1153
01:18:32,650 --> 01:18:34,870
Scott: Yeah, if you have no interest in Counter-Strike, just do the baseline test.

1154
01:18:35,631 --> 01:18:37,010
Scott: Even if you have no interest in FPS games.

1155
01:18:37,410 --> 01:18:39,028
Scott: Because you probably own Counter-Strike.

1156
01:18:39,650 --> 01:18:40,889
Scott: I guess you have to own Counter-Strike.

1157
01:18:41,150 --> 01:18:44,009
Scott: So I guess don't buy Counter-Strike if you don't want to play it.

1158
01:18:44,270 --> 01:18:54,469
Scott: But if you own Counter-Strike, even if you never play it, do this thing one time, even if you're not an FPS player, just to see how it works and judge yourself, I guess.

1159
01:18:55,031 --> 01:18:56,830
Rym: You know what game needs this more than anything?

1160
01:18:57,552 --> 01:18:57,615
Rym: NS2.

1161
01:18:58,690 --> 01:19:06,730
Scott: Yeah, and I hope to see more like this for basically every competitive esports game that exists.

1162
01:19:07,050 --> 01:19:09,389
Scott: I want to see things like this, and I want to see them go further.

1163
01:19:09,872 --> 01:19:12,269
Scott: And I want to see them fill in the cracks that this has.

1164
01:19:13,511 --> 01:19:16,470
Scott: And I hope that becomes like a model going forward.

1165
01:19:17,333 --> 01:19:24,330
Scott: You got a competitive multiplayer game, where's the training program, where's the coaching, where's the playmaster, whatever.

1166
01:19:24,891 --> 01:19:26,629
Scott: It becomes a mandatory thing.

1167
01:19:27,891 --> 01:19:32,090
Scott: But if Logitech wants to provide it as a third party, that's fine too.

1168
01:19:33,413 --> 01:19:36,750
Scott: In real sports, both first and third parties provide training.

1169
01:19:37,110 --> 01:19:44,270
Scott: You practice with your team, and you also get in the off-season, you practice on your own with your personal practice gym or whatever you pay for.

1170
01:19:44,832 --> 01:19:53,796
Rym: Well even like a musical instrument, I would do drills by myself, I'd also play by myself, I also had a coach, like an instructor, to give me private lessons, and I was also in bands.

1171
01:19:53,837 --> 01:19:56,390
Rym: I got all these different ways to get good at the thing.

1172
01:19:57,030 --> 01:19:57,423
Rym: Here we are.

1173
01:19:58,672 --> 01:20:00,389
Scott: So Logitech Playmaster, check it out.

1174
01:20:00,830 --> 01:20:03,370
Scott: Exciting stuff for a competitive esports game.

1175
01:20:09,620 --> 01:20:11,740
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1176
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:16,880

1177
01:20:17,261 --> 01:20:22,300

1178
01:20:22,580 --> 01:20:25,220

01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:55,179
Rym: I put my Walkman on and said I might as well kick it.

1188
01:21:08,466 --> 01:21:10,455
Rym: But now, I leave you with...

1189
01:21:31,981 --> 01:21:32,215
Scott: Hey!

1190
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:35,808
Scott: Here's my energy cheat show!

Scott: This!

1194
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:47,467
Scott: Russia.

1195
01:21:47,528 --> 01:21:48,097
Scott: Bitch!

1196
01:21:48,781 --> 01:21:49,378
