Rym: good restaurants you've eaten at?

10
00:00:40,067 --> 00:00:40,970
Rym: perhaps a bike ride?

11
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:42,469
Scott: No, none of that.

12
00:00:43,575 --> 00:00:46,822
Scott: so, you know that You know certain things.

13
00:00:46,903 --> 00:00:50,520
Scott: it's like we're not Completely out of things here, right?

14
00:00:50,601 --> 00:00:52,570
Scott: It's like if you need TP you can get TP.

15
00:00:52,771 --> 00:00:58,978
Rym: Oh, yeah, I just ordered a giant crate of TP from a restaurant supply company, right worst case You can get some low-quality stuff, right?

16
00:00:58,998 --> 00:01:01,670
Rym: Yeah, like the grocery store has almost everything in stock still.

17
00:01:02,331 --> 00:01:09,848
Scott: Yeah, but one thing that you know, we can get but we can't get the good stuff is paper towel, right?

18
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:23,834
Rym: Oh So that you know, I do have stuff to say because we way back bought some super organic compostable like easily degraded like environmentally friendly paper towel and It was so bad.

19
00:01:23,874 --> 00:01:24,596
Rym: It was unusable.

20
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:28,189
Rym: Like if you got it wet, it just disintegrated into nothing.

21
00:01:29,377 --> 00:01:32,750
Scott: So yeah, we bought some paper towel.

22
00:01:33,532 --> 00:01:39,189
Scott: That was some shady ass brand and you could tell right out of the package that it was flimsy and thin.

23
00:01:39,832 --> 00:01:43,270
Scott: Yeah, I was going to pat dry some some meats, right?

24
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,670
Scott: And the paper towel came apart and like disintegrated into the meat like a seasoning.

25
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,650
Scott: So that happened with a soggy paper towels on my meats that I had to pick off with my fingers.

26
00:01:53,353 --> 00:01:57,088
Rym: I used a fork to like scrape it off because it was embedded in the meat.

27
00:01:57,993 --> 00:02:01,370
Rym: We might have used the same shitty toilet paper paper paper towel.

28
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,896
Scott: You're using toilet paper.

29
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:04,563
Scott: that explains why you're disintegrated.

30
00:02:04,743 --> 00:02:06,028
Scott: that explains all your problems.

31
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:09,710
Rym: Yep It was that paper towel definitely paper towel.

32
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:15,768
Rym: that paper towel was so bad really shitty that we put it aside bought entirely new paper towel and I kept it.

33
00:02:15,828 --> 00:02:22,490
Rym: the sole thing I Was gonna use it for was to like clean up grease spills when I'm working on my bike or something like that.

34
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:22,631
Rym: Like.

35
00:02:22,691 --> 00:02:25,230
Rym: I was just gonna use it for like garbage tasks.

36
00:02:25,832 --> 00:02:26,716
Rym: But then this happened.

37
00:02:26,957 --> 00:02:30,030
Rym: and guess what paper towel I've been using in the kitchen off and on the shitty one.

38
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:35,230
Scott: Yeah, you got to get some more of the good stuff because the shitty stuff is like it's just not working.

39
00:02:35,491 --> 00:02:36,917
Scott: Yeah, the worst thing is not like.

40
00:02:36,937 --> 00:02:37,600
Scott: that's like.

41
00:02:37,701 --> 00:02:41,556
Scott: it's a pretty first-world problem, obviously but it's still.

42
00:02:41,636 --> 00:02:49,239
Scott: it's like the difference between the good stuff and the not good stuff was More extreme than you would expect.

43
00:02:50,123 --> 00:02:51,510
Scott: I mean, it's notably different.

44
00:02:51,992 --> 00:02:59,036
Rym: I would believe that because it's not a matter of like, oh this one's nicer, but the environmentally friendly one is Nice enough but does the job?

45
00:02:59,116 --> 00:03:01,003
Rym: it's like it doesn't even do the job.

46
00:03:01,023 --> 00:03:03,230
Rym: You're better off having nothing, right?

47
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,849
Scott: It's not like oh, yeah, I can get to work in a Honda Civic or a BMW.

48
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:13,370
Scott: This is like imagine if you know a BMW drove and a Honda Civic like lost a wheel on the way to work.

49
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:14,334
Scott: That's what this is.

50
00:03:14,615 --> 00:03:14,857
Rym: Yeah.

51
00:03:14,877 --> 00:03:15,017
Rym: Yeah.

52
00:03:15,118 --> 00:03:21,710
Rym: Well, I could see you can use cheap toilet paper But the Wegmans one-ply doesn't really qualify as toilet paper.

53
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,576
Scott: Yeah, it's not great.

54
00:03:24,777 --> 00:03:30,903
Rym: I think at that point you're better off just taking a shower every time you Do your business and let's what if you're not at home?

55
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,075
Rym: Uh Don't know what you do.

56
00:03:33,115 --> 00:03:41,310
Rym: then if your only option is when the Wegmans one-ply Use the underwear and bail That might be a better option Alright.

57
00:03:43,874 --> 00:03:44,837
Rym: So, uh, there is.

58
00:03:44,917 --> 00:03:45,820
Rym: there's a little bit of news.

59
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,689
Rym: I think you had a news first about some HBO anime biz going on.

60
00:03:49,672 --> 00:03:50,915
Scott: Yeah, it's not a huge news.

61
00:03:50,995 --> 00:03:56,670
Scott: But basically HBO max, which I guess is like HBO is the most confusing streaming service.

62
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:01,250
Scott: I don't use any of their stuff, but they have like HBO go HBO now HBO max.

63
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:06,650
Scott: It's like all these different services for people who are or are not paying for HBO on cable television.

64
00:04:07,911 --> 00:04:17,857
Scott: And I guess from what I understand I could be wrong about this because it's so confusing as the HBO max is basically, then Netflix competitor of HBO.

65
00:04:17,937 --> 00:04:18,738
Scott: I mean just pay for it.

66
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,363
Rym: I'm not gonna lie HBO.

67
00:04:20,464 --> 00:04:23,988
Rym: Anything is a Yarr situation for me.

68
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:30,790
Scott: Yeah, pretty much HBO match new streaming platform a twelve dollars a month, right?

69
00:04:32,132 --> 00:04:42,090
Scott: So the news is sort of a Wednesday news that HBO max is going to be Partnering with the crunchyroll and is going to include a handful of crunchyroll anime.

70
00:04:42,231 --> 00:04:44,870
Scott: Not all of them like 17 of them, right?

71
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,937
Scott: But basically the 17 top ones.

72
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:55,003
Scott: so it's like if you're the kind of person who is an anime nerd You need the crunchyroll because you're gonna be watching stuff that like normal people do not.

73
00:04:55,404 --> 00:04:57,070
Scott: yeah watch ever, right?

74
00:04:57,771 --> 00:05:04,230
Scott: But if you are a person who just watches an occasional anime, you know that the big ones right.

75
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,299
Scott: Netflix has sort of been killing in that department.

76
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,890
Rym: I mean Netflix has like all the great anime.

77
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:13,134
Rym: They're out like you want to watch Beastars Like anything.

78
00:05:13,154 --> 00:05:16,450
Scott: well, that's a Netflix made anime, but they got like, you know, they got one punch man.

79
00:05:16,591 --> 00:05:17,659
Scott: They got I don't know for some reason.

80
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:19,070
Scott: They don't have season 2 of one punch, man.

81
00:05:19,991 --> 00:05:21,576
Scott: They got that ghost in the shells.

82
00:05:21,616 --> 00:05:23,463
Scott: They got you know, a lot of the top animes.

83
00:05:23,503 --> 00:05:36,738
Scott: the evangelicals are on the Netflix Whether Netflix makes them or not, but HBO go or HBO max, whatever the hell It's gonna have the top crunchyroll ones.

84
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:40,230
Scott: So now it's like ah, you know, it's like the Disney Plus.

85
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,381
Scott: They don't have any animes on there, right?

86
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:48,190
Scott: It's like a no anime zone Right Hulu, I think has a lot of animes actually.

87
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:53,183
Scott: But that's basically I guess the reason Disney Plus doesn't because that's also a Disney thing Hulu, right?

88
00:05:54,206 --> 00:06:00,521
Rym: I This point what I pay for is Netflix crunchyroll Disney Plus and nothing else.

89
00:06:01,343 --> 00:06:01,484
Scott: Yeah.

90
00:06:01,504 --> 00:06:06,966
Scott: I mean, that's what I have right now - But we're not paying for the Disney Plus or really using it.

91
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:14,697
Rym: We're using it cuz we have it for free watching like all the old Disney movies and randomly We watched this old Disney documentary about a squirrel.

92
00:06:14,738 --> 00:06:17,146
Rym: that was better than I expected.

93
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:18,774
Scott: Okay, sure.

94
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:37,690
Scott: Anyway, so yeah, if you're the kind of person who wants to watch HBO stuff right, this makes HBO max like something that you wouldn't think of as like, you know, like an actual Well, you think of it as like a tier below the Netflix of the Disney Plus in terms of like streaming services

95
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,857
Rym: Which it is still a tier below like.

96
00:06:39,877 --> 00:06:42,285
Scott: let's not but it but it almost gets it there.

97
00:06:42,345 --> 00:06:50,517
Rym: It's almost like hey Well also remember HBO max is where the new Further adventure times are going to be.

98
00:06:50,537 --> 00:06:55,831
Rym: Oh, that's interesting adventure time distant lands for one hour long Specials.

99
00:06:56,454 --> 00:06:59,246
Scott: Well, I'm sure we can find those on the high seas somewhere.

100
00:06:59,266 --> 00:07:03,338
Rym: Oh, yeah the special like.

101
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:10,490
Rym: we haven't really paid attention to it because it was Intended to be released in 2020 and we don't actually know a lot about them.

102
00:07:10,872 --> 00:07:14,490
Rym: The only thing I remember that we knew I think we even talked about this is there are four episodes.

103
00:07:14,974 --> 00:07:23,401
Rym: They are called in order be mo obsidian wizard city and Together again and suppose all about that wizard city.

104
00:07:23,602 --> 00:07:24,365
Rym: Oh, yeah.

105
00:07:24,746 --> 00:07:25,790
Scott: Oh, oh this much.

106
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,196
Rym: You know what the plot of that one is.

107
00:07:27,658 --> 00:07:32,077
Rym: peppermint butler goes to school to relearn magic Sounds good to me.

108
00:07:32,178 --> 00:07:33,649
Rym: I am down with that.

109
00:07:34,131 --> 00:07:38,387
Rym: Obsidian is princess bubblegum and Marceline meditate on their relationship on a mission.

110
00:07:38,407 --> 00:07:41,741
Scott: be mo You know, I have almost every adventure time comic.

111
00:07:41,801 --> 00:07:42,745
Scott: Have you read any of those?

112
00:07:42,806 --> 00:07:43,710
Rym: I read a bunch of them.

113
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:50,510
Rym: Yeah The last one a quest reconnects Finn the human and Jake the dog.

114
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:54,789
Rym: I guess they go their separate ways at some point and be mo be mo journeys to space.

115
00:07:56,392 --> 00:08:03,003
Rym: We know from the end of adventure time that be mo must come back from space at some point sure But I guess be mo goes to space.

116
00:08:03,345 --> 00:08:27,230
Rym: So, uh, yeah HBO max may have a little bit of a thing going on but this anime news in particular I think will be good for anime as a whole because I think and I see there are a lot of people who Kind of know of anime but are not really anime fans who have ended up watching things like Castlevania or Beastars just because it's on Netflix and Netflix like recommends it to them next to other stuff.

117
00:08:27,754 --> 00:08:29,670
Rym: I feel like HBO max will be a similar situation.

118
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:36,928
Rym: I think you're gonna see a lot of people who will like bump into Fullmetal Alchemist be like Isn't that that anime thing and watch a little bit and get into it?

119
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:42,748
Scott: Maybe I wonder if anyone will like start like discover anime from HBO max or Netflix.

120
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,590
Rym: I mean, how did I just go to crunchyroll?

121
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:46,995
Rym: Cuz how did I discover anime?

122
00:08:47,035 --> 00:08:47,175
Rym: like?

123
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:51,270
Rym: literally just it was on the sci-fi network one day and I was like, what's this cartoon?

124
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:53,134
Scott: Pretty much.

125
00:08:53,154 --> 00:08:54,179
Rym: Yeah people younger than us.

126
00:08:54,259 --> 00:09:00,570
Rym: It was just like on Cartoon Network like hey There's the regular cartoons and then there's this good cartoon every day at four o'clock for some reason.

127
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,233
Rym: What's up with that?

128
00:09:01,253 --> 00:09:04,485
Scott: pretty sure people are though or these days are discovering it from internet.

129
00:09:05,008 --> 00:09:12,669
Rym: Yeah, but There are still a terrifying number of not that internet people Sure, so some other news.

130
00:09:13,671 --> 00:09:17,948
Rym: You know, we hate cars, but this the story is wouldn't would be funny if it wasn't so sad.

131
00:09:17,968 --> 00:09:22,734
Rym: So Philadelphia is Basically the poor.

132
00:09:22,754 --> 00:09:27,950
Rym: it one of the poorest large cities and I think it's the poorest and least funded large city in America.

133
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:30,344
Scott: Like Philly is huge, but you got Detroit.

134
00:09:30,948 --> 00:09:38,710
Scott: God Philly's bigger than Detroit because Detroit collapse Sure, but you got places like, you know mobile, Alabama.

135
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:39,894
Rym: Those are small cities.

136
00:09:40,075 --> 00:09:41,119
Rym: or relatively small city.

137
00:09:41,139 --> 00:09:44,030
Rym: Philly's actually a pretty huge city like in terms of population.

138
00:09:44,794 --> 00:09:46,301
Rym: There's a lot of things going on with the Philly.

139
00:09:46,341 --> 00:09:48,010
Rym: Philly is a big deal in that regard.

140
00:09:49,211 --> 00:09:50,899
Rym: Don't worry about shit all over Philly cuz.

141
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:56,829
Rym: Philly's got some problems but Philly has Compared to if you would pretend New York City does not exist.

142
00:09:57,513 --> 00:10:00,387
Rym: Philly has one of the better mass transit systems in America.

143
00:10:00,508 --> 00:10:07,929
Rym: now again I have to stress that's that's like saying oh one of the least smelly diarrhea Is it if you get pooped on by like 10 really awful animals?

144
00:10:09,051 --> 00:10:15,389
Rym: But one of those animals is like relatively clean like a rabbit pooping on you is way preferable to like a cat pooping on you.

145
00:10:16,312 --> 00:10:27,911
Rym: But if the rabbit doesn't exist New York City being the rabbit then you've got your choice of many Terrifying animals to poop on you, but Philly pretending your doesn't exist pretty good transit system Like.

146
00:10:27,932 --> 00:10:28,961
Rym: they actually have a subway.

147
00:10:28,981 --> 00:10:32,517
Rym: They have a bunch of light rail They have a really extensive bus network and a lot of people use it.

148
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:42,495
Rym: However, that transit system is going completely broke Right now like way worse than normal way worse than the MTA Makes sense.

149
00:10:42,535 --> 00:10:43,901
Rym: Yeah, but you want to know why.

150
00:10:44,423 --> 00:10:49,550
Rym: like the specific riding it No one's riding it, but that would be fine because it's got other forms of funding.

151
00:10:49,852 --> 00:10:52,148
Rym: In fact people riding it barely funds it.

152
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:57,086
Rym: It's funding comes primarily from tolls on the Pennsylvania turnpike.

153
00:10:57,106 --> 00:11:01,858
Rym: because Philly and Pennsylvania Were actually smart they fund their transit system.

154
00:11:01,878 --> 00:11:08,290
Rym: that can't be funded by the local population because the local population is relatively poor per capita But the transit system is necessary.

155
00:11:08,713 --> 00:11:10,950
Rym: They tax cars to fund transit.

156
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:24,200
Rym: However, because no one is driving on the Pennsylvania turnpike that now the transit system despite actually being used significantly by First-responders and critical workers has no money because it can't never

157
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:31,299
Scott: understood why states it seems like every state does this right where they have Specific taxes tied to specific expenses.

158
00:11:31,439 --> 00:11:34,950
Scott: I feel like wouldn't it just make sense to have all taxes go into a common pile of money?

159
00:11:36,058 --> 00:11:36,279
Scott: I can.

160
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:37,790
Scott: I would then be budgeted out.

161
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,394
Rym: I can tell you exactly why that.

162
00:11:39,434 --> 00:11:51,734
Rym: the reason why what you just suggested is not the case anywhere in America anymore Nor is it the case pretty much anywhere in the world is because of specific corruption in the old that you know The term slush fund.

163
00:11:51,754 --> 00:11:55,230
Rym: just don't be fucking corrupt that you're talking to America.

164
00:11:55,933 --> 00:12:00,470
Rym: How hard is our Supreme Court just ruled that it is not technically illegal to be corrupt.

165
00:12:00,995 --> 00:12:12,034
Rym: That's just because we didn't make laws The convictions with the corruption law because the law wasn't enough to cover this exact Specific kind of corruption.

166
00:12:12,235 --> 00:12:29,741
Rym: the reason the law is not good enough the reason why every municipality in America will take specific tax dollars and say they can be only used for specific purposes is because every time Anywhere in America has ever had general funds The general funds are used to cause evil.

167
00:12:30,222 --> 00:12:32,490
Rym: every time hundred percent evil embezzlement.

168
00:12:32,811 --> 00:12:38,150
Rym: They'll just like cuz then you have like a mayor or a governor or like some city official who's corrupt.

169
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:40,180
Rym: We'll just be like, yeah, I just won't fund the schools.

170
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:40,562
Rym: Fuck you.

171
00:12:41,326 --> 00:12:42,110
Scott: No, you can't do that.

172
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:42,733
Scott: There's a budget.

173
00:12:42,773 --> 00:12:44,683
Scott: you have to money from the general fund has.

174
00:12:44,724 --> 00:12:48,570
Scott: you has to be given out Proportionally to all of the things that are expensive.

175
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:52,630
Rym: Yeah, so they just set the percentage to zero and there's no law that prevents them from doing that.

176
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:56,090
Scott: No, the percentage should be set in law when you vote on the budget.

177
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,730
Rym: Yeah Here's the other problem.

178
00:12:58,951 --> 00:13:05,289
Rym: you know all all the laws that get passed to force balance but battles budgets or to force minimum levels of funding.

179
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:13,049
Rym: the reason those fail is because the municipalities are literally incapable of raising that much money and end up having constitutional crises like every time.

180
00:13:13,109 --> 00:13:23,089
Scott: and then The law should also say yeah, if you don't have enough money all taxes go up Proportionally equally on all things and that also doesn't work for a bunch of other reasons.

181
00:13:24,135 --> 00:13:24,317
Scott: Uh-huh.

182
00:13:24,479 --> 00:13:33,350
Rym: I think that does work Now because the taxes would have to go up specifically only on rich people or you end up driving people out of their town.

183
00:13:33,532 --> 00:13:37,088
Scott: In fact, I've seen situations Should be on rich people.

184
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:45,710
Rym: Yeah but that's that would never pass because stupid people the only thing stupid people care about more than Themselves is making sure that rich people remain rich.

185
00:13:46,614 --> 00:13:52,504
Rym: well So yeah, Philly's transit system that cannot sell fund and the state refuses to fund.

186
00:13:52,764 --> 00:14:00,890
Rym: the state actually did fund by pet taxing cars But now because cars are gone the transit system that is actually still being used in crucial cannot actually be funded.

187
00:14:01,872 --> 00:14:04,170
Rym: Burma shave the aristocrats.

188
00:14:06,575 --> 00:14:24,499
Rym: So in another really brief news We talked about this on Tuesday that game Valorant the counter-strike II overwatch II like new game coming out from riot As we mentioned it has this dodgy anti-cheat software that is provided by Tencent, which is a giant Probably dodgy Chinese conglomerate.

189
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:37,130
Rym: I don't want to get into all the reasons why I don't trust that company, but There are now a lot of confirmed reports of that malware and anti cheating software causing all sorts of chaos in people's PCs.

190
00:14:38,131 --> 00:14:39,617
Scott: Yeah, I mean that was from the start.

191
00:14:39,657 --> 00:14:41,966
Scott: people were saying that you know, this looks like trouble.

192
00:14:42,046 --> 00:14:52,630
Scott: and then afterwards There were several stories of trouble and I guess it's hard to tell which stories are real and which ones aren't Especially because you have people who don't know technology complaining about stuff.

193
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:54,758
Scott: It could just be some dude installed it.

194
00:14:54,798 --> 00:14:59,919
Scott: then his computer exploded and he's like, oh you see it was the The Chinese government.

195
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:09,650
Rym: remember remember when our neighbors when we were in college Called campus safety on us because they said we were hacking them because our IPX network frames were being picked up by their firewall.

196
00:15:10,533 --> 00:15:12,270
Rym: Sure, like that kind of shit happened.

197
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:19,750
Rym: So here's an article that finally actually breaks down these specific Concerns and issues that people are raising about this software.

198
00:15:20,393 --> 00:15:27,946
Rym: so I'm probably not going to play Valorant or even try it despite the fact that the game actually looks okay, and I'm interested in it.

199
00:15:27,966 --> 00:15:30,175
Scott: I Wouldn't play it.

200
00:15:30,337 --> 00:15:31,650
Scott: I wouldn't play any right game.

201
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:33,756
Scott: Well, it's right is basically in the market of.

202
00:15:34,378 --> 00:15:38,690
Scott: look at popular genres of game on PC and make one of those.

203
00:15:39,051 --> 00:15:41,119
Scott: Yeah, just apply their own stuff to it.

204
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:42,103
Scott: It's like oh, we'll make a mo.

205
00:15:42,244 --> 00:15:43,770
Scott: There's a moba called dota out there.

206
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:44,272
Scott: We'll make one.

207
00:15:44,312 --> 00:15:45,236
Scott: We'll call League of Legends.

208
00:15:45,397 --> 00:15:48,510
Rym: Oh and it ended up being more like the bigger one really, right?

209
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:51,300
Scott: And now they're basically saying oh look, there's an auto chess.

210
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,123
Scott: We'll make one of those.

211
00:15:52,224 --> 00:15:53,047
Scott: Oh, there's FPS.

212
00:15:53,067 --> 00:15:53,790
Scott: We'll make one of those.

213
00:15:54,092 --> 00:15:55,301
Scott: It's like any game that's out there.

214
00:15:55,342 --> 00:15:56,289
Scott: They're gonna make one of those.

215
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:59,082
Scott: Yeah, but as a gamer is nothing original that they make.

216
00:15:59,142 --> 00:16:00,850
Scott: they don't do anything original at all.

217
00:16:01,671 --> 00:16:05,164
Rym: But I mean at the same time counter-strike kind of just action.

218
00:16:05,225 --> 00:16:06,329
Rym: quick too, but slower.

219
00:16:07,511 --> 00:16:11,487
Scott: Counter-strike was at least original in that.

220
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:19,730
Rym: What about counter-strike source and then counter-strike go and then whatever the next counter-strike will be which is just other versions of counters.

221
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,296
Scott: Yeah, like there wasn't a counter.

222
00:16:21,357 --> 00:16:21,879
Scott: It's like yeah.

223
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:24,470
Scott: action quake had the die and wait thing.

224
00:16:24,691 --> 00:16:25,476
Rym: It also had the.

225
00:16:25,496 --> 00:16:34,670
Scott: it's like you one hit kills you Yes, but it was action quake was still pretty much every man for themselves deathmatch II kind of situation.

226
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,180
Rym: No, there were two modes.

227
00:16:36,201 --> 00:16:46,890
Scott: The primary mode was five on five Yeah, but counter-strike had the DE and the CES and the you know, as well the oh my god AS or yes Yeah, and FY.

228
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:48,783
Scott: That was there.

229
00:16:50,572 --> 00:16:52,919
Rym: Really, I mean I assumed FY stood for.

230
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:57,353
Rym: fuck you Man we can.

231
00:16:57,373 --> 00:16:57,915
Rym: we even didn't.

232
00:16:57,935 --> 00:17:01,809
Rym: even we got into counter-strike on the tail end of AS missions continuing to exist.

233
00:17:02,852 --> 00:17:04,944
Rym: Yeah, pretty much all rig with some good times.

234
00:17:05,428 --> 00:17:13,300
Rym: So yeah Don't like be wary of Valorant even though the game actually looks like it might be good.

235
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,990
Rym: I don't think you want to install it just yet.

236
00:17:16,451 --> 00:17:20,969
Rym: Let's wait and see how many people's computers get grossly violated and or catch on fire.

237
00:17:26,176 --> 00:17:28,944
Rym: but anyway things Of the day.

238
00:17:28,984 --> 00:17:29,529
Rym: What do you got?

239
00:17:30,911 --> 00:17:32,498
Scott: So way back in 1971 there was.

240
00:17:32,579 --> 00:17:33,784
Scott: there was not a.

241
00:17:33,824 --> 00:17:34,447
Rym: there was never in.

242
00:17:37,591 --> 00:17:38,553
Scott: Okay, whatever.

243
00:17:39,034 --> 00:17:42,022
Scott: there was a TV commercial for McDonald's.

244
00:17:42,042 --> 00:17:45,170
Scott: that was quite a production we should say.

245
00:17:46,812 --> 00:17:48,679
Scott: And not having been alive at the time.

246
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,310
Scott: I did not see this commercial when it was on television.

247
00:17:51,491 --> 00:17:53,950
Rym: I've never seen this before until you sent me the link, right?

248
00:17:54,070 --> 00:18:00,052
Scott: I did not have a nostalgic memory for it as I do for many classic commercials that did air when I was still watching Television.

249
00:18:00,072 --> 00:18:03,186
Rym: Yeah, I think my earliest like commercial memory is where's the beef?

250
00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:16,905
Scott: Yeah And this come is fabulous high production value for 1971 television commercial Apparently contains famous actors Anson Williams and John Amos who I don't know who they are.

251
00:18:16,925 --> 00:18:18,510
Scott: I had to google who they were.

252
00:18:18,871 --> 00:18:20,478
Rym: Oh, the first recommended video is Johnny.

253
00:18:20,539 --> 00:18:25,176
Rym: John Amos discusses the McDonald's grab a bucket And mob commercial.

254
00:18:25,758 --> 00:18:28,330
Scott: Yeah, but what's interesting is not only is it a singing?

255
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:33,150
Scott: Dancing musical McDonald's commercial which is you know, pretty fabulous.

256
00:18:33,792 --> 00:18:37,583
Scott: It is also that it's not about the food.

257
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:52,389
Scott: almost every McDonald's commercial or any food commercial you see these days right is always like You know doctored food photos and you know Get a McRib or a Big Mac or whatever, you know dollar menus and stuff like that, right?

258
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:59,439
Scott: This is all about look how fucking clean McDonald's is well, or at least the McDonald's in the video is.

259
00:18:59,520 --> 00:18:59,801
Scott: I can

260
00:19:00,022 --> 00:19:19,744
Rym: give a little bit of context for that because the modern concept of fast food was evolving in that era and if you look at the history of Restaurants in the United States like and we've talked about this in cake nights before but like in eras before the 70s There really weren't restaurants that like people would go to the way we go to today.

261
00:19:19,824 --> 00:19:23,188
Rym: restaurants acted very differently in America a long time ago.

262
00:19:23,531 --> 00:19:24,654
Rym: prohibition kind of changed that.

263
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:40,310
Rym: the evolution of fast food is like you could spend your life just studying the rise of fast food and The restaurant ecosystem that Existed in America in like the 50s and 60s and how broken and filthy and like messed up that ecosystem was.

264
00:19:41,432 --> 00:19:44,770
Scott: Yeah, I mean, it's funny if you watch like lots of old movies, right?

265
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:49,910
Scott: The restaurants that people go to are almost always in hotels, right?

266
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:50,975
Scott: They're hotel restaurants.

267
00:19:51,035 --> 00:19:52,844
Scott: this you don't see that.

268
00:19:52,884 --> 00:20:01,729
Rym: many stand-alone Old movies see three times the restaurants fancy fancy restaurant that may or may not be in a hotel diner or it's a bar.

269
00:20:02,974 --> 00:20:06,329
Rym: The only exception is it's like depending on the kind of piece it is.

270
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:10,925
Rym: There might be like a local like family style place, but that's it.

271
00:20:11,106 --> 00:20:12,049
Rym: four kinds of restaurants.

272
00:20:13,432 --> 00:20:18,834
Rym: pretty much so in the vein of old Commercials my thing of the day.

273
00:20:18,854 --> 00:20:20,138
Rym: I found this video.

274
00:20:20,198 --> 00:20:22,666
Rym: It's a commercial for a roller coaster.

275
00:20:22,866 --> 00:20:25,035
Rym: It's from 1989.

276
00:20:25,035 --> 00:20:25,826
Scott: We were alive then.

277
00:20:25,846 --> 00:20:36,041
Rym: yeah It's what I have nostalgia for because it's a commercial for the Magnum XL 200 roller coaster That debuted in 1989 at Cedar Point.

278
00:20:36,382 --> 00:20:39,935
Rym: when I was a kid when this roller coaster was built It was probably.

279
00:20:40,015 --> 00:20:41,320
Scott: how did you see that commercial?

280
00:20:41,561 --> 00:20:43,770
Scott: I guess I guess you lived much closer to Cedar Point.

281
00:20:43,991 --> 00:20:52,939
Rym: So you realize when I was a kid, but that's kind of why I made this my thing of the day The entire like multi-state area around Cedar Point.

282
00:20:52,979 --> 00:21:14,757
Rym: if you lived anywhere in like, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Illinois Every year Before summer people would kind of wait for the Cedar Point commercial because every year Cedar Point would make a new commercial Like a high production value commercial and that commercial would reveal what the new roller coaster was because every year They made a new roller coaster.

283
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:18,253
Scott: I guess there wasn't an internet to just find out Exactly.

284
00:21:18,453 --> 00:21:28,488
Rym: So like yeah, I remember like there'd be local news stories saying rumors are that after the Simpsons tomorrow We will get to see the first commercial of Cedar Point's new ride.

285
00:21:28,973 --> 00:21:29,888
Rym: We don't know what it is.

286
00:21:30,191 --> 00:21:31,576
Rym: Stay tuned to find out like.

287
00:21:31,677 --> 00:21:34,930
Scott: and none of those news reporters went to Cedar Point with like a camera.

288
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:38,341
Rym: No, Cedar Point had like fucking security lockdowns.

289
00:21:38,401 --> 00:21:40,106
Rym: They treated a pretty big.

290
00:21:40,146 --> 00:21:46,996
Scott: you can see it from far away I'm sure yeah, but they would hard to hide a roller coaster it is true But they would put walls up.

291
00:21:47,196 --> 00:21:51,789
Rym: Well as far as long as they could during like the early construction they'd cover stuff in shrouds.

292
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:54,550
Rym: They wouldn't tell anything about the name of the roller coaster.

293
00:21:55,272 --> 00:22:00,005
Rym: And also there wasn't really an internet like news agencies like really just didn't spoil it.

294
00:22:00,346 --> 00:22:00,727
Rym: They'd wait.

295
00:22:00,767 --> 00:22:01,769
Rym: we'd wait for the announcement.

296
00:22:02,412 --> 00:22:03,538
Scott: It was a. we had those two.

297
00:22:03,558 --> 00:22:08,799
Scott: what there was, you know, our commercials were for Six Flags Yeah, a Riverside or other places like that.

298
00:22:08,979 --> 00:22:13,839
Scott: and which rep which became Six Flags New England eventually when I bought it out And those commercials.

299
00:22:13,859 --> 00:22:15,649
Scott: they didn't have a new roller coaster every year.

300
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:23,969
Scott: Well Cedar Point was crazy and weird like and the commercials that they did show for the specific rides Would be proportional like to the cost of the ride.

301
00:22:24,471 --> 00:22:36,529
Scott: So like when the Great American Scream Machine was made that you saw commercials for that thing for like several years Advertising Anymore as far as I'm aware like around March.

302
00:22:37,052 --> 00:22:42,010
Rym: It would just be like everyone in school like as a kid would be buzzing like Cedar Point commercials coming soon.

303
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:42,953
Rym: What are they building?

304
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:43,695
Rym: What's going on?

305
00:22:43,736 --> 00:22:48,050
Rym: Cuz every year they'd have a giant new ride and I remember was notable.

306
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:55,723
Rym: there was one year was neither 94 or 95 where they didn't actually have a new ride and It was kind of like this weird local existential crisis.

307
00:22:56,004 --> 00:22:59,044
Rym: People were like a cedar point doing okay Why did they make another roller coaster?

308
00:22:59,064 --> 00:22:59,609
Rym: What's going on?

309
00:23:00,971 --> 00:23:12,809
Rym: But I rode this roller coaster when it came out because when it was riding any roller coasters now, nope But it was the tallest and fastest roller coaster in the world by a wide margin.

310
00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:18,189
Rym: like This roller coaster when it came out was a big deal and made international news.

311
00:23:19,532 --> 00:23:24,790
Rym: It took a long time for roller coasters to exceed what the Magnum was capable of.

312
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:27,555
Rym: This was the first mega coaster, but it wasn't the first giga coaster.

313
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:36,316
Rym: in the meta moment Not doing much trying to make more content like keep watching our youtubes follow our stuff.

314
00:23:36,597 --> 00:23:37,480
Rym: Join our discord.

315
00:23:38,203 --> 00:23:39,199
Rym: Things are hopping in there.

316
00:23:39,883 --> 00:23:46,540
Rym: Things are hopping more and more in there as I'm trying to remind people to actually go to it actually giving them the link When they ask me starting to try to hang out in there more.

317
00:23:47,581 --> 00:23:48,484
Rym: Forum still rocking.

318
00:23:48,966 --> 00:23:50,190
Rym: We're making content.

319
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:51,555
Rym: I got my teleprompter set up.

320
00:23:51,595 --> 00:23:53,080
Rym: I'm gonna do something this weekend.

321
00:23:53,542 --> 00:23:55,429
Scott: I don't know if that are you really good to do something?

322
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:57,879
Rym: I'm gonna do something, but it'll be relatively acid.

323
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:04,599
Rym: Well, mostly I'm gonna record a bunch of stuff just to make to set up my pipeline to very quickly be able to.

324
00:24:04,619 --> 00:24:15,301
Rym: I'm trying to set up an area in the living room where we're storing stuff because it's not like we're gonna have anyone over anytime soon and Make it really easy to just sit down record a video like me to me talking video Like.

325
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:17,231
Rym: I want to be able to do that with zero efforts.

326
00:24:17,271 --> 00:24:18,498
Rym: That's what I'm setting up this weekend.

327
00:24:19,553 --> 00:24:21,419
Rym: Mmm-hmm Because you know think about it.

328
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:34,380
Rym: Imagine how different the things we produce would be if there was a building we could both just go to Like after work or anytime we wanted and there was just a studio and we could both just sit down Hit a button and just start doing something.

329
00:24:35,021 --> 00:24:35,946
Scott: There are places like that.

330
00:24:36,006 --> 00:24:36,710
Scott: You just pay money for.

331
00:24:36,751 --> 00:24:38,199
Rym: yeah, but I'm not paying money for that.

332
00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:41,536
Rym: I got time for that and money for you had to be able to go places exactly.

333
00:24:41,556 --> 00:24:44,205
Rym: So Yeah, I'm not.

334
00:24:44,225 --> 00:24:46,440
Rym: I don't need to have like anyone over to play board games.

335
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,371
Rym: So the board game like kitchen table area is gonna be the.

336
00:24:49,893 --> 00:24:57,920
Rym: I'm gonna be able to talk with the teleprompter area And then maybe I'll just if anything if I upload anything, I'll just upload like my own random teleprompter testing.

337
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,919
Rym: I'm not gonna actually make like a video video yet.

338
00:25:01,164 --> 00:25:01,573
Rym: Maybe I will.

339
00:25:01,593 --> 00:25:08,328
Rym: we'll see Beyond all right playgrounds playgrounds Occupied your idea.

340
00:25:08,348 --> 00:25:10,020
Rym: I mean, did you have a better idea?

341
00:25:10,901 --> 00:25:11,536
Rym: No, there we go.

342
00:25:12,303 --> 00:25:30,460
Rym: But the playground like the playground had this almost mythological and very important like place in my psyche when I was a kid because I couldn't get to playgrounds unless my parents took me to them and They always seemed far away and big and it was like a special deal to go to the playground.

343
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:36,936
Rym: I always wanted to go to them Partly because they had to think kind of like the arcade even though I had video games at home.

344
00:25:37,277 --> 00:25:39,163
Rym: the arcade had games I couldn't have at home.

345
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:40,527
Rym: I had toys at home.

346
00:25:40,848 --> 00:25:42,112
Rym: the playground had toys.

347
00:25:42,634 --> 00:25:44,720
Rym: I couldn't have at home, right?

348
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:49,120
Scott: It's like you have a swing at home and then it's like you go to the playground and there's a fuck it.

349
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:52,033
Rym: So yeah, the swing at the playground was like the swing.

350
00:25:52,073 --> 00:25:53,600
Rym: I could really hurt myself on his foot.

351
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,508
Rym: I got a slide.

352
00:25:54,649 --> 00:25:59,993
Scott: you got a slide at home But at the playground they had like a giant slide or a spiral slide.

353
00:26:00,093 --> 00:26:02,120
Scott: Yeah, you know some mega slide.

354
00:26:03,341 --> 00:26:10,100
Scott: It's like, you know, there's no way unless you were mega rich that you could have something that big and or dangerous at home.

355
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:11,756
Scott: Yeah equal to what the playground had.

356
00:26:13,362 --> 00:26:15,595
Scott: But nowadays they don't make playgrounds like that anymore.

357
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:16,300
Scott: I'm an old man.

358
00:26:17,168 --> 00:26:19,987
Rym: Some of the things that are gone Definitely should be gone.

359
00:26:20,027 --> 00:26:21,273
Rym: Those things were just death traps.

360
00:26:21,655 --> 00:26:22,740
Rym: some of the things that are gone.

361
00:26:23,226 --> 00:26:26,886
Rym: I see why they're gone But I want to see a modern Reimplementation of those things.

362
00:26:27,227 --> 00:26:30,460
Rym: like it's a mixed bag on what has come and gone in playgrounds over the years.

363
00:26:31,042 --> 00:26:37,888
Rym: Like I do appreciate the fact that there exists surfaces that will prevent Serious injuries when a child falls from a height.

364
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:38,731
Rym: that did not.

365
00:26:38,992 --> 00:26:47,375
Rym: that rubbery stuff did not exist when we were kids No, so I usually either fell on sand or more often asphalt and I kind of hurt myself off in it.

366
00:26:47,395 --> 00:26:55,160
Scott: playgrounds or wood chips Or gravel the wood chips that always vaguely smelled like pee or just dirt and grass or sand.

367
00:26:56,622 --> 00:27:04,640
Rym: And we got to separate the school playground from the municipal playground though as a kid We often went to the school playground on weekends because there's no one there.

368
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:07,339
Rym: It wasn't locked like the cops wouldn't stop us or anything.

369
00:27:08,364 --> 00:27:09,820
Scott: Well, there were certain features, right?

370
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:15,160
Scott: So like I remember when I went to New York City playgrounds, they would often have like some sort of water feature.

371
00:27:15,222 --> 00:27:24,711
Rym: It's oh, yeah Yeah Like that was not a thing in like Detroit or the Sun like I know like that is a very New York thing to have That water feature in the playground, right?

372
00:27:24,752 --> 00:27:26,882
Scott: But the thing is even nowadays It's like you'd.

373
00:27:26,923 --> 00:27:31,280
Scott: the water features that the playgrounds have are sort of like little crapple sprinklers or something like that.

374
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,446
Scott: Did you see the new?

375
00:27:33,486 --> 00:27:39,948
Rym: because they rebuilt all those playgrounds by the projects north of us like between us My apartment in your apartment along the water.

376
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:42,279
Rym: There are some pretty big water features in there.

377
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:52,632
Scott: now No, there are ones I remember like they had like mega like fountain type things or like almost wading pool type stuff Going on.

378
00:27:52,774 --> 00:27:56,130
Rym: Yeah Little bit of that going on in the new part of the playground.

379
00:27:56,150 --> 00:28:03,320
Scott: if you find some old playgrounds that haven't been remodeled Which are becoming fewer and fewer because City Council people love to yeah ribbons on playground.

380
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:09,037
Rym: Someone told me a while ago that Highland Park like the last great wooden playground that I knew about was finally demolished.

381
00:28:09,678 --> 00:28:18,900
Scott: Yeah but like those If you can find one you can still see some like features that are there but disabled, right?

382
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,760
Scott: There's no water flowing and no one turns it on.

383
00:28:20,841 --> 00:28:31,514
Rym: Yeah, even as a kid They were always like every play get our rent to it had like the features that were still in use But there were like the ruins of the old features Like I remember when I was really really young.

384
00:28:31,555 --> 00:28:34,759
Rym: there was one playground We'd always go to in Detroit and it had like stuff.

385
00:28:35,201 --> 00:28:45,966
Rym: But there were these metal posts with like in cement blocks that clearly were there to hold up like old Seesaws that were not there anymore and as a kid I was vaguely obsessed with like.

386
00:28:46,468 --> 00:28:48,819
Rym: what was there that I never got to play with?

387
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:54,159
Scott: I Was always like Even at like my elementary school.

388
00:28:55,002 --> 00:29:03,548
Scott: right, it's like we go to the playground and There was pretty early on when I got there like kindergarten first grade They built like a new wooden thing.

389
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:06,960
Scott: right that was you know, the wooden style castle kind of sit.

390
00:29:07,222 --> 00:29:09,240
Rym: Oh, that's the best the best possible furniture.

391
00:29:10,402 --> 00:29:11,867
Scott: It was one of the earlier ones though.

392
00:29:11,928 --> 00:29:13,132
Scott: So it wasn't that castle II.

393
00:29:13,172 --> 00:29:15,140
Scott: Yeah opposed to some later ones, right?

394
00:29:15,422 --> 00:29:20,672
Scott: It was the early model castle But they put it next to the old playgrounds.

395
00:29:20,772 --> 00:29:27,459
Scott: the old school playground With like just fucking swings and jungle gym seesaw, right?

396
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:43,618
Scott: Was still there and then there was the new one and then there was a third one That was just like these exercise bits like pull-up bar Right like that sort of thing and not actually play like it wasn't fun.

397
00:29:43,638 --> 00:29:50,220
Scott: Yeah It was like all these exercise things and next to each one was like a board that told you how to exercise on.

398
00:29:50,481 --> 00:29:52,210
Rym: Oh, yeah, those are all around New York.

399
00:29:52,251 --> 00:29:53,718
Rym: Like those are still like a really common thing.

400
00:29:54,402 --> 00:29:56,434
Scott: Oh, yeah boy, like you're an adult who wants to exercise.

401
00:29:56,474 --> 00:29:56,998
Scott: That's great.

402
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:01,636
Scott: But as a kid When you're a kid is like god damn it, this isn't fun.

403
00:30:01,656 --> 00:30:02,120
Scott: I don't want this.

404
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:05,151
Rym: It's like discovering that what you thought was a chocolate chip was a raisin.

405
00:30:05,171 --> 00:30:06,617
Rym: You're just like ah, okay.

406
00:30:06,757 --> 00:30:16,220
Rym: I love raisins though Yeah, but if you had the choice between a cookie with a raisin in it a cookie with a chocolate chip in it But not a raisin hater.

407
00:30:16,541 --> 00:30:23,400
Rym: So my favorite feature forever in playgrounds was always the giant wooden playscape like the big wooden castle thing.

408
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:24,708
Scott: Yeah, but you know those.

409
00:30:24,809 --> 00:30:25,756
Scott: it's weird because it's like.

410
00:30:25,796 --> 00:30:32,369
Scott: it feels Like, you know because of how old I am it feels like that those were newer But actually, you know those.

411
00:30:32,389 --> 00:30:34,399
Rym: they were on the way out even when we were young.

412
00:30:35,142 --> 00:30:42,100
Scott: They started to come into existence when I was in elementary school and they started to fade Right when I wasn't like a school college.

413
00:30:42,502 --> 00:30:48,105
Rym: There was I think it was three mile park in Michigan Detroit and I remember as a kid.

414
00:30:48,125 --> 00:30:51,900
Rym: there was a big construction project and they built this three story.

415
00:30:52,281 --> 00:30:54,128
Rym: Well three kids story not three real stories like.

416
00:30:54,168 --> 00:30:55,312
Rym: it had three levels.

417
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,340
Rym: That's how like giant it was.

418
00:30:57,842 --> 00:31:09,132
Rym: it was basically like it was a structure so big that you could get lost in it and I remember being like utterly dumbstruck the first time I saw it as a kid and my brother and I endeavored to.

419
00:31:12,282 --> 00:31:14,038
Rym: We were eventually found and brought home.

420
00:31:15,222 --> 00:31:19,080
Rym: But I love those things to the point that as an adult I would still play in them.

421
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,501
Rym: I remember vampire tag Like.

422
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,126
Rym: I miss those days.

423
00:31:22,307 --> 00:31:32,599
Rym: if there if there were a wooden playground like that in New York City today I would 100% get people together and play vampire tag in it like without any hesitation.

424
00:31:34,521 --> 00:31:45,240
Scott: The other thing is that like I think we've talked about this in the episode long ago, but like it's sesame place They had you know many things that were you know playground adjacent, right?

425
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:53,931
Scott: So there was like this cargo net thing that existed that I think was torn down at some point because obviously there's no way that That's safe enough for anyone in the year 20.

426
00:31:53,931 --> 00:31:55,420
Rym: Yeah, I love those things.

427
00:31:55,521 --> 00:31:59,162
Rym: I had one at Cedar Point that we would always be all about Right.

428
00:31:59,222 --> 00:32:03,013
Scott: It was almost like, you know McDonald's play place on crack.

429
00:32:03,073 --> 00:32:04,899
Scott: Yeah, right just like extreme, right?

430
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:12,680
Scott: It was like several stories tall tons of nets all over the place tubes You know, it was like, you know, I don't remember if they let adults in there.

431
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:15,069
Scott: I think they did but it's like how did you get in there?

432
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:18,180
Scott: There's such narrow tube ways and stuff.

433
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:32,020
Rym: Yeah, Cedar Point had a place called I think it was King Arthur's something like Camelot something but it was on the roof of this other ball pit building and it was basically just a giant one of those with cargo nets everywhere and basically zero supervision.

434
00:32:32,821 --> 00:32:37,998
Scott: Yeah type sesame place cargo net into into Google image search and you'll see what I'm talking about.

435
00:32:38,058 --> 00:32:40,749
Scott: Yeah How crazy this thing was.

436
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:41,552
Rym: so get this.

437
00:32:41,632 --> 00:33:04,014
Rym: I was googling for pictures of the old wooden place That's and I found a whole bunch of pictures that look Identical to the one we played vampire tag out at RIT and I learned something in All of New York like much of New York State other than New York City Almost every wooden structure and playgrounds was made by one company Leathers and associates in Ithaca.

438
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:12,680
Scott: Yeah I mean that makes sense because when you went to different towns to see their different playgrounds They all looked pretty much the same and had the same pieces arranged in different ways.

439
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:21,420
Rym: But Leathers was the company that made the one that was good for vampire tag Specifically and I thought I just looked at all these pictures of their play sets.

440
00:33:21,702 --> 00:33:23,820
Rym: They all look like Highland Park and they all look amazing.

441
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,606
Scott: Yeah, that's yeah.

442
00:33:25,847 --> 00:33:30,047
Rym: Yeah, so other than the giant structures Like what was your favorite thing in the playground?

443
00:33:30,087 --> 00:33:33,860
Rym: Like what was well, like what would you say is the top tier playground thing?

444
00:33:34,942 --> 00:33:46,723
Scott: Well, I mean it all depends right because it you know If you're if you like swing is a good swing, right a good swing But it's like if it's a shitty swing I don't care.

445
00:33:46,783 --> 00:33:47,165
Scott: so right.

446
00:33:47,246 --> 00:33:49,940
Scott: or it's like you have a good slide or a shitty slide, right?

447
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:55,053
Scott: So it's like I don't prefer swing or a slide But I just if it's good then it's good.

448
00:33:55,093 --> 00:33:55,677
Scott: if it's not good.

449
00:33:55,717 --> 00:33:56,884
Scott: It's not good I think it might.

450
00:33:56,924 --> 00:34:03,539
Rym: my favorite feature like ever was large tire swing like the ones that were big.

451
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:21,080
Rym: Mmm, you know, we have like a tire hanging from the roof because they felt more dangerous than they were and they required a moderate Amount of skill to not hurt yourself, but you wouldn't ever really hurt yourself too badly Unless they were installed badly like I remember as a kid like I love these tire swings.

452
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:29,155
Rym: We even had one but we had some friends and they had a tire swing they'd made and their tire Swing was way too close to the trunk of the tree.

453
00:34:29,215 --> 00:34:29,899
Rym: It was hanging from.

454
00:34:31,565 --> 00:34:32,799
Rym: It was very easy to hit that trunk.

455
00:34:33,701 --> 00:34:36,940
Scott: Well, but also if you put it further away down the branch the branch might snap.

456
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:40,154
Rym: Yeah, it's got to be a real good tree to make that kind of tire swing.

457
00:34:40,516 --> 00:34:41,480
Rym: but and the playground?

458
00:34:41,641 --> 00:34:47,719
Rym: I did like the one that was like a tractor tire hanging sideways like hanging from three chains that would spin.

459
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:49,842
Rym: mmm.

460
00:34:50,562 --> 00:34:55,322
Rym: Yeah, my mate my main go-to as a kid was to climb inside the tire and get someone else to spin it as fast as Possible.

461
00:34:55,985 --> 00:34:56,146
Scott: Yep.

462
00:34:56,266 --> 00:34:57,192
Scott: That's a that's a good one.

463
00:34:57,252 --> 00:34:59,161
Scott: Yeah, but yeah, that's the thing It's like.

464
00:34:59,322 --> 00:35:02,654
Scott: so rather than say like which feature was the best right?

465
00:35:02,754 --> 00:35:04,480
Scott: What makes a good one, right?

466
00:35:05,001 --> 00:35:07,732
Scott: What's a good slide from the bad slide, right?

467
00:35:07,752 --> 00:35:13,651
Scott: So for me the best slide is a slide You'll never find these days, which is the solid steel.

468
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:16,057
Scott: heats up in the Sun will burn you slide.

469
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:18,765
Scott: Yeah, but just Ridiculously tall.

470
00:35:18,805 --> 00:35:18,946
Scott: Yep.

471
00:35:19,026 --> 00:35:19,751
Scott: That was my favorite.

472
00:35:20,153 --> 00:35:21,280
Rym: That was my favorite thing by far.

473
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:25,933
Scott: There was one that I don't know how ridiculously tall they actually were when I was a kid.

474
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:32,250
Scott: right because I haven't seen any That's still standing back went to my memory.

475
00:35:32,511 --> 00:35:35,180
Scott: Is that the tall slides were fucking tall?

476
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,953
Rym: There was a slide so tall in a playground.

477
00:35:37,973 --> 00:35:39,140
Rym: We used to go to in Detroit as a kid.

478
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,365
Rym: I remember one point I looked up.

479
00:35:40,425 --> 00:35:44,262
Rym: apparently it was like 30 feet tall and it was notably tall like Like.

480
00:35:44,422 --> 00:35:48,220
Rym: people knew how tall it was because parents thought it was a problem and wanted to turn down.

481
00:35:48,682 --> 00:35:52,480
Rym: But it was tall enough to where the ladder to climb up to it was cage.

482
00:35:52,881 --> 00:36:01,920
Rym: So you couldn't get on the outside of it and fall off and there was a cage around the whole top Until you actually slid down the slide a little bit and then there was no more cage.

483
00:36:04,701 --> 00:36:10,918
Scott: I'm looking I'm looking at like some websites about dangerous old playgrounds and you can see how tall the slides were.

484
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:15,336
Scott: and it's like Oh, yeah, they were as tall as I remember pretty like what you think.

485
00:36:15,416 --> 00:36:15,938
Rym: Oh, I was a kid.

486
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:17,445
Rym: How tall could they have been?

487
00:36:17,485 --> 00:36:21,060
Rym: you go to his adult and you're like, I'm actually kind of afraid of that as an adult.

488
00:36:21,962 --> 00:36:24,438
Scott: Yeah as a kid, it wasn't a fry wasn't afraid of it at all.

489
00:36:24,478 --> 00:36:29,900
Rym: Yeah Some of the changes they've made make sense because as a kid we had a play set like we had one of those things.

490
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:37,069
Rym: It's like two tees with monkey bars in the middle and like a thing hanging off of the ends like in our backyard Like that was our mini play set.

491
00:36:37,471 --> 00:36:43,020
Rym: But as a kid, I remember one day I just like climbed up on top of it and I stood up on the tee.

492
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:47,620
Rym: So now I'm standing like almost 14 feet off the ground and I just jumps.

493
00:36:48,102 --> 00:36:53,180
Rym: I had like just I into the ground with no thought about why I was doing this or whether or not it was dangerous.

494
00:36:54,403 --> 00:36:56,220
Scott: Here's a picture of an old metal slide.

495
00:36:56,361 --> 00:37:00,576
Scott: It says on on sunny days without shade the metal slide could get up past 160 degrees.

496
00:37:02,842 --> 00:37:06,214
Scott: And here's a 35 foot tall spiral slide.

497
00:37:06,736 --> 00:37:07,880
Rym: Oh, I like the spiral side.

498
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,229
Rym: The problem was the spiral slide.

499
00:37:10,911 --> 00:37:15,559
Rym: if you make it out of like modern safe materials Do you go too slow and they're actually not fun at all?

500
00:37:16,361 --> 00:37:22,724
Rym: If you make them out of metal while they're fine and fast they get so hot that they are dangerous Like I don't I do.

501
00:37:22,844 --> 00:37:26,938
Rym: I do not miss the fact that I multiple times got blister burns from slides.

502
00:37:26,999 --> 00:37:29,140
Scott: as a kid Like I was there and on them all the time.

503
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:34,400
Rym: Yeah, I think that was a problem, but there was this era where they started making slides out of plastic.

504
00:37:34,642 --> 00:37:36,599
Rym: But the plastic you'd slide really fast on it.

505
00:37:36,941 --> 00:37:39,933
Rym: but I remember the problem was that style slide.

506
00:37:40,254 --> 00:37:43,949
Rym: you would generate a Massive static charge by sliding down.

507
00:37:44,451 --> 00:37:45,936
Rym: and I remember one time as a kid.

508
00:37:45,996 --> 00:37:48,520
Rym: I was in like third grade We had one of these at the school.

509
00:37:48,821 --> 00:37:52,899
Rym: The school ended up getting rid of the slide because other kids kept hurting themselves on it the same way I did.

510
00:37:52,919 --> 00:38:03,986
Rym: I Slid down it and when I got to the bottom I went to stand up and my right arm touched a metal bolt that was like recessed in the slide holding it together And I got a static shock.

511
00:38:04,067 --> 00:38:06,455
Rym: so bad my entire arm went numb and I couldn't move it.

512
00:38:07,178 --> 00:38:07,800
Scott: Yeah, it makes sense.

513
00:38:07,861 --> 00:38:09,880
Rym: Yeah, the school actually got rid of that slide.

514
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:14,459
Rym: It only existed for like a month and then they got rid of it, but it was perhaps so fast.

515
00:38:15,064 --> 00:38:24,140
Scott: Yeah, I think if you want to really talk about danger I mean maybe in just Anecdotally the one you see people hurting themselves with the most on the internet is the merry-go-round where you can freely.

516
00:38:25,902 --> 00:38:32,396
Rym: Those have to be banned solely because kids are too stupid to use them safely Like they don't understand how dangerous that actually is.

517
00:38:32,416 --> 00:38:37,280
Scott: Yeah It's like you spin it around as kids want to spin it as fast as possible and jump on.

518
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:37,450
Scott: Yeah

519
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:51,938
Rym: And the problem is if you get a kid who's smart enough to come up with a way to spin it faster But not smart enough to Understand the improve the increased danger of spinning it faster like turning a bike sideways and putting the wheel up against it We did that a few times.

520
00:38:52,584 --> 00:38:54,158
Scott: Well, I mean you can just deal with.

521
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:55,223
Scott: you know The laws of physics.

522
00:38:55,303 --> 00:39:00,360
Scott: right is like if you can somehow increase the you know, you start with a large radius spinning, right?

523
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:04,978
Scott: Yeah, so you get the spin coming from the outside and then you get everyone to get towards the inside.

524
00:39:04,998 --> 00:39:06,724
Rym: Yep We did the same thing.

525
00:39:07,426 --> 00:39:11,520
Scott: or it's like even if you're just spinning alone on like say the tire swing that you just mentioned.

526
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:11,741
Scott: Right.

527
00:39:11,781 --> 00:39:13,508
Scott: It's like you stick your legs out you spin.

528
00:39:13,528 --> 00:39:14,734
Scott: Yeah, you tuck them in.

529
00:39:14,754 --> 00:39:16,240
Rym: We oh we had this kid Chris.

530
00:39:16,361 --> 00:39:21,454
Rym: I remember we were hanging out in the playground one day when we were kids and we Got the tire swings.

531
00:39:21,494 --> 00:39:22,180
Rym: We wound it up.

532
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:27,479
Rym: We got a spinning so fast that it spun for a while and when it stopped spinning Chris was literally passed out in it.

533
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,246
Scott: Yeah, makes sense.

534
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:30,594
Rym: Yeah, like the blood just like went out.

535
00:39:30,614 --> 00:39:31,480
Rym: He's just like passed out.

536
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:36,827
Rym: He was fine, but that that could have been a problem Theoretically could have been a lot of problems.

537
00:39:36,847 --> 00:39:42,893
Scott: and it's like, you know, I think oh, you know, we my whole life I was on these dangerous, you know survivor bias like we just got lucky.

538
00:39:43,575 --> 00:39:44,940
Scott: Well, it's not even survivor bias.

539
00:39:45,061 --> 00:39:47,763
Scott: It's like if I think back it's like yeah We survived.

540
00:39:47,884 --> 00:39:52,600
Scott: but it's like there are basically injuries and band-aid situations like on a daily basis.

541
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:59,860
Rym: Yeah Like I remember like I think back to when I was in elementary school Like how many kids had broken arms like in any random class?

542
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,118
Rym: I was in compared to how many kids have broken arms in any random elementary school class.

543
00:40:04,158 --> 00:40:11,552
Scott: today It's a safer time like yeah, it's like when I was in school there was as someone had a cast on at like all times.

544
00:40:11,592 --> 00:40:16,677
Scott: there was always some kid in the class of the cast that we could draw on and Seeing kids on the street.

545
00:40:16,717 --> 00:40:22,440
Scott: today I don't see a lot of cast like I remember in Because those kids are not out on the street because they can't they're having injury.

546
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:33,120
Rym: But there were like five or six five or six kids broke their arm in My class in fifth grade during that one school year and all but one of those breakages were on the playground during school.

547
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:45,234
Rym: But I think my favorite thing to do in the playground like my go-to was always the swings and Generally, I just tried to swing as high as possible and I was always chasing the.

548
00:40:45,255 --> 00:40:48,411
Rym: I want to go over the bar Like I was one of those kids who tried.

549
00:40:48,431 --> 00:40:49,679
Scott: you wanted to go over the bar.

550
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:51,989
Scott: Okay I just I wanted to jump off the swing.

551
00:40:52,009 --> 00:40:53,596
Rym: So I did jump off the swing all the time.

552
00:40:53,636 --> 00:40:55,486
Rym: We'd go for distance We'd have distance competition.

553
00:40:55,506 --> 00:40:56,451
Scott: Oh, yes, that's actually.

554
00:40:56,471 --> 00:40:57,517
Scott: that's absolutely what we do.

555
00:40:57,617 --> 00:40:59,092
Scott: even at home We would go for distance.

556
00:40:59,214 --> 00:41:00,910
Scott: at home We went for distance.

557
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:05,820
Scott: so much so like, you know The home playground the home swing set was concreted into the ground.

558
00:41:06,021 --> 00:41:14,540
Scott: Yep, but we would swing so hard that like some of the concrete Like jump like to do the same thing happened.

559
00:41:15,042 --> 00:41:23,957
Rym: We we started at the bottom like where the poles that held our first place set up Started to bend and deform and they were kind of broken and we had to replace it because we'd cause damage to it.

560
00:41:24,539 --> 00:41:31,305
Rym: No But yeah, and that we we have my brother and I and like we had at the playground We always had distance contests.

561
00:41:31,326 --> 00:41:37,940
Rym: a lot of kids hurt themselves with those distance contests not in the landing Like I don't think anyone ever like broke a bone on the landing.

562
00:41:38,441 --> 00:41:47,428
Rym: but multiple kids cut themselves badly because when they jumped they like didn't fully let go of the swing and would get caught in the Chain in some fashion.

563
00:41:47,448 --> 00:41:49,460
Scott: I think that was the real danger, right?

564
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:55,763
Scott: It's like if you successfully jumped it's like you would go forward and as long as there wasn't anything out there for you to hit Besides ground.

565
00:41:55,843 --> 00:41:57,629
Scott: Yeah, you had a nice kid body.

566
00:41:57,690 --> 00:42:01,222
Rym: You could land pretty sure a kid body landing on grass Like.

567
00:42:01,263 --> 00:42:04,159
Rym: you were fine 99% of the time unless you got really lucky.

568
00:42:04,749 --> 00:42:15,620
Scott: but yeah if you if on your release if either you Didn't release enough or if your clothing got caught on the chains or anything like that, then you could be in trouble.

569
00:42:15,801 --> 00:42:18,230
Rym: I saw a lot of really bloody cuts because of that.

570
00:42:18,451 --> 00:42:20,719
Rym: I cut myself pretty badly a few times with that.

571
00:42:21,505 --> 00:42:25,388
Scott: Yeah, I think there were actually a lot of swing sets Even the dangerous ones.

572
00:42:25,449 --> 00:42:27,340
Scott: they put rubber coverings on the chains.

573
00:42:27,465 --> 00:42:28,724
Scott: Yeah prevent a lot of those types.

574
00:42:28,784 --> 00:42:33,362
Rym: my parents put those rubber coverings on the chains of our home swing set and they were always that Came with them.

575
00:42:33,783 --> 00:42:35,689
Scott: Oh, it just came that way out of the box.

576
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:36,652
Rym: Not bad.

577
00:42:37,073 --> 00:42:39,400
Rym: The thing is that's a solvable problem.

578
00:42:39,681 --> 00:42:48,550
Rym: I remember the first time I saw in an anime that Japanese style swing set where instead of a chain It's like bars with chain links on the ends of them.

579
00:42:49,212 --> 00:42:51,077
Scott: That would be so much self issues.

580
00:42:51,097 --> 00:42:51,900
Scott: You just ropes.

581
00:42:52,881 --> 00:42:53,986
Rym: Yeah, the problem is the ropes.

582
00:42:54,327 --> 00:42:57,540
Rym: so many kids would get rope burns on their hands because they wouldn't quite let go on the jump.

583
00:42:58,583 --> 00:43:02,711
Rym: You know, it's better than a chain true But the ropes also would get damaged.

584
00:43:03,073 --> 00:43:09,576
Rym: I remember one day We don't know if anyone got hurt but one day we went out to recess and I remember one of the swings was broken.

585
00:43:09,636 --> 00:43:12,227
Rym: the rope had just like Broken at the top and snapped.

586
00:43:12,247 --> 00:43:15,540
Scott: Yeah, I just find it kind of funny how you know.

587
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:16,605
Scott: It's like playground.

588
00:43:16,625 --> 00:43:19,540
Scott: the dangerous ones existed for a super long time, right?

589
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:21,689
Scott: It's like our parents had playgrounds and they were kids right?

590
00:43:21,709 --> 00:43:24,480
Scott: Yep, and I don't know if their parents did or not.

591
00:43:25,581 --> 00:43:25,962
Rym: They did.

592
00:43:25,982 --> 00:43:29,451
Rym: I've been looking up some histories sure and so.

593
00:43:29,632 --> 00:43:43,020
Scott: but those adults right the generations before us Right, so boomers and older right as they got older Most of them didn't really have seemed to like recreate the playground in any way, right?

594
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:48,280
Scott: It's like they would you know do other stuff, but it seems like our generation and younger.

595
00:43:48,942 --> 00:43:50,586
Scott: It's like what are people doing?

596
00:43:50,867 --> 00:43:53,152
Scott: They're rock climbing right?

597
00:43:53,253 --> 00:43:54,255
Scott: It's like what the hell is that?

598
00:43:54,336 --> 00:43:56,040
Scott: It's a fucking playground, right?

599
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:57,425
Scott: It's like you fooling anybody.

600
00:43:57,445 --> 00:43:58,730
Scott: They're going to the ropes course.

601
00:43:58,791 --> 00:43:59,755
Scott: It's like what the fuck is that?

602
00:44:00,016 --> 00:44:01,060
Scott: Hey fooling anybody?

603
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:04,032
Scott: That's a fucking playground for adult size, right?

604
00:44:04,112 --> 00:44:05,980
Scott: It's like who you fooling, right?

605
00:44:07,581 --> 00:44:13,660
Rym: So it's interesting that I don't know our generation in general of experiences matter more to us than things.

606
00:44:14,203 --> 00:44:23,060
Scott: I don't know if the people younger than us who had Who came after the wooden castle playground right into the land of the safe?

607
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:26,459
Scott: But still potentially fun playground because they still see kids having fun on those.

608
00:44:26,627 --> 00:44:27,763
Scott: Yeah They must be good.

609
00:44:27,843 --> 00:44:29,628
Rym: the playground by Vernon Jackson near us.

610
00:44:29,869 --> 00:44:34,986
Rym: like if it wasn't it literally illegal for me to enter that playground I would go in there and play.

611
00:44:35,367 --> 00:44:36,593
Scott: Oh, yeah, that's if there is.

612
00:44:36,633 --> 00:44:38,771
Scott: the playgrounds weren't illegal for me to go in I would go in.

613
00:44:38,995 --> 00:44:39,138
Rym: yep.

614
00:44:40,201 --> 00:44:44,716
Scott: But yeah, the they're clearly having fun on those even though they appear much safer.

615
00:44:44,776 --> 00:44:49,819
Scott: this so there wasn't like, you know This imagined danger fun trade-off that I think is just not real.

616
00:44:51,123 --> 00:45:02,226
Scott: but I wonder if those kids on those will a Have that same Nostalgia and or even it whether it's a nostalgia or not, but have that desire for a playground when they're older Mm-hmm.

617
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:17,260
Scott: And also I wonder how many kids outside of cities where there's a lot of playgrounds how like as the playground Interest decreased because of internet like our kids still playgrounding How many suburban kids still have playground in their swing set?

618
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:21,260
Rym: I mean, I do think back to when we were at Disney several years ago me and Emily for someone's wedding.

619
00:45:21,742 --> 00:45:24,880
Rym: And while we were there we were like we've ran into this family.

620
00:45:24,961 --> 00:45:41,718
Rym: we're kind of near them for a while and their kid had a like op tablet out and was watching a YouTube stream of someone playing Minecraft and gave zero fucks about Disney and was pissed the entire time that they couldn't just watch the stream and that they had to walk around Disney while they watched the stream.

621
00:45:42,724 --> 00:45:46,362
Rym: Uh-huh, I Just remember that as a moment pure Anecdote.

622
00:45:46,382 --> 00:45:51,560
Rym: it like I don't know because the playgrounds at least in New York completely full all the time except now obviously.

623
00:45:52,352 --> 00:45:55,072
Rym: Yeah Like the one in Vernon Jackie, you can't find a place.

624
00:45:55,394 --> 00:45:56,280
Rym: So I saw something interesting.

625
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:00,076
Rym: I'm skimming through the Wikipedia to see if there's like anything any notable things about playgrounds.

626
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:16,780
Rym: and there's this whole idea in like the research around playgrounds that one of the primary values of a playground for children is that Adults and parents Feel like they control the playground and thus and it feels like a place that's relatively safe for the kids.

627
00:46:17,201 --> 00:46:23,116
Rym: So they tend to get lax in their attention leaving the kids more unsupervised than the parents realize.

628
00:46:23,417 --> 00:46:24,600
Rym: but how simultaneously?

629
00:46:25,302 --> 00:46:27,426
Rym: That's actually the primary value.

630
00:46:27,486 --> 00:46:36,832
Rym: playgrounds have two children because it gives them less supervised time to explore boundaries more without Significantly increased risk with only slightly increased risk.

631
00:46:37,073 --> 00:46:39,020
Rym: and there's like real study around that.

632
00:46:40,081 --> 00:46:45,960
Scott: Yeah, that seems accurate to me because when I was on the playground it definitely felt like, you know much like at the public pool.

633
00:46:46,061 --> 00:46:52,872
Scott: It's like yeah your parents bring you there They sit on the side and then you're in this Separate land and you almost forget they exist until they come to get.

634
00:46:52,892 --> 00:46:55,060
Rym: and then did you do the thing where you'd like seek out?

635
00:46:55,400 --> 00:47:12,300
Rym: Like you'd climb into the tiny area of the play set that really wasn't supposed to be a place to hang out But there'd be like ten kids hanging out in there for some reason Yep, or like there's the three trees like on the edge of the playground and like kids would just like cluster hiding inside of those Trees for some reason even though there's a giant field next to them.

636
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:13,781
Rym: They're just ignoring that.

637
00:47:13,842 --> 00:47:23,600
Scott: one of the wooden ones had a feature that was just a bunch of tires as almost like a ramp and I guess the Idea was that you would climb up the tires to get to the top and then go over the bar and now you're in the playground.

638
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:24,785
Rym: There's hiding inside the tires.

639
00:47:25,187 --> 00:47:28,100
Scott: people would just go underneath the tires and that's like a little fort area.

640
00:47:28,866 --> 00:47:30,700
Scott: So there's like a blanket fort situation.

641
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:35,900
Rym: There's specific evidence that those tiny spaces and forts are like for whatever reasons.

642
00:47:36,002 --> 00:47:43,320
Rym: No one's 100% sure Why are crucial to that childhood development and like the way kids interact on playgrounds like you got a memory?

643
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,806
Scott: That I don't know if it's real or not.

644
00:47:46,227 --> 00:47:47,692
Scott: Maybe my mom could confirm it.

645
00:47:48,134 --> 00:47:55,380
Scott: memory is that there was a tiny Children's clothing store somewhere in Connecticut that I would she would take me to to buy clothes in the mall.

646
00:47:56,381 --> 00:48:01,299
Scott: No, I stand alone like strip mall clothing store, okay, there's only children's clothing.

647
00:48:01,319 --> 00:48:01,600
Scott: I don't know.

648
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:02,366
Scott: I have this memory.

649
00:48:02,487 --> 00:48:04,260
Scott: it could be false depending on what you say.

650
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,610
Rym: I think I know the place you're talking about.

651
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:07,031
Rym: I think it was.

652
00:48:07,051 --> 00:48:07,774
Rym: no you don't chain.

653
00:48:07,794 --> 00:48:09,421
Scott: Oh I get.

654
00:48:09,482 --> 00:48:10,667
Scott: I guess that could be possible.

655
00:48:10,687 --> 00:48:11,651
Scott: They didn't feel Cheney.

656
00:48:12,174 --> 00:48:29,587
Scott: It felt indeed anyway But my memory is that in the back of the clothing store There was basically next to the door for the bathroom Was like a mouse hole but big enough for a child to go through but not big enough for an adult to go through and You would go in that hole.

657
00:48:29,607 --> 00:48:31,420
Scott: and there was a room behind the store.

658
00:48:31,781 --> 00:48:38,200
Scott: No, it was like a carpeted room that had like I don't was there a television showing children's programming?

659
00:48:38,361 --> 00:48:44,741
Scott: Maybe but I definitely remember there being like, you know like a Fisher Price car and some toys and Some.

660
00:48:45,444 --> 00:48:51,355
Scott: it was like a. it was like a hidey secret kind of place and it felt like adults couldn't get in there Although I'm sure they could.

661
00:48:51,396 --> 00:48:54,852
Rym: yeah If so, there was something very similar in all the malls like this.

662
00:48:54,952 --> 00:48:56,940
Rym: there were multiple of these and I remembered as a kid.

663
00:48:57,302 --> 00:49:11,827
Rym: It was a children's clothing store that was in the mall and in the entrance There's like a normal entrance and there was this little mouse hole with carpet in it like just like so like next to it connecting the mall to the store next to the regular door and kids would always go crawling through the hole.

664
00:49:11,848 --> 00:49:16,155
Rym: or Kids would like wedge themselves in that hole like upside down and just play in the hole.

665
00:49:16,175 --> 00:49:25,457
Rym: and inside the store There's another little mouse hole that went into like this playroom that had like a tiny slide and a TV and like some kids toys And there were never adults in that tiny room.

666
00:49:27,481 --> 00:49:30,594
Scott: Mmm, it's similar to my yeah, possibly false memory.

667
00:49:30,614 --> 00:49:32,100
Rym: I'm trying to google a little bit.

668
00:49:32,221 --> 00:49:41,126
Rym: I can't figure out what the fuck this place was to even begin to find a picture to figure out if this was actually a chain that we both went to or My memory was not a chain.

669
00:49:41,166 --> 00:49:44,517
Scott: My memory was like a dark brown carpeted 70s 80s style room.

670
00:49:45,821 --> 00:49:48,734
Rym: Yeah, but this might really but part of the difference might be.

671
00:49:48,754 --> 00:49:53,293
Rym: I lived in an area That was very much more mall centric as opposed to strip malls.

672
00:49:53,353 --> 00:49:57,349
Scott: I live directly next to a mall Yeah, but this place was not in that mall.

673
00:49:57,509 --> 00:50:05,549
Rym: Yeah, the place I'm talking about was in the mall specifically Anyway, but it's like there's all these playground adjacent things.

674
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:06,873
Scott: right McDonald's play place.

675
00:50:07,475 --> 00:50:09,200
Scott: even the McDonald's play places nowadays.

676
00:50:09,341 --> 00:50:10,709
Scott: They're like a bunch of tubes, right?

677
00:50:10,729 --> 00:50:12,700
Scott: Yeah, like plastic tubes.

678
00:50:13,142 --> 00:50:16,533
Scott: I remember ones like when I was super young and I still went to McDonald's.

679
00:50:16,614 --> 00:50:21,227
Scott: there was one that was basically a giant Hamburger like it was on a stick.

680
00:50:21,489 --> 00:50:23,919
Rym: Yeah, there was one of those inside of Chuck E. Cheese's.

681
00:50:24,763 --> 00:50:27,760
Scott: You would go in the stick and climb up a ladder inside.

682
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:31,480
Rym: I mean hit your head on it because it was really hard even as a tiny kid to navigate that thing.

683
00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:33,900
Scott: It would not be impossible for an adult to get in there.

684
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:34,703
Scott: I don't know how they would.

685
00:50:34,723 --> 00:50:42,138
Scott: then you're inside like this basic UFO on a stick similar to like You know, I guess Corona Park right like a world.

686
00:50:42,158 --> 00:50:47,073
Rym: I Remember that exact that exact feature in the Chuck E. Cheese.

687
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:48,137
Rym: Well, it wasn't a Chuck E. Cheese.

688
00:50:48,157 --> 00:50:48,900
Rym: I'm saying Chuck E. Cheese.

689
00:50:49,181 --> 00:50:56,560
Rym: It was actually a major magics, but I don't think anyone knows what that is Right, but I feel like there is a McDonald's with a play place.

690
00:50:57,241 --> 00:51:04,213
Scott: Actually in a story and by the subway, but and they actually redid it recently They totally renovated that play place.

691
00:51:04,233 --> 00:51:09,218
Scott: like these things still exist But I just don't feel they're that prevalent as they used to be.

692
00:51:09,238 --> 00:51:16,439
Rym: yeah Well the way fast-food places make money and the place like the way they interact with society has changed a lot.

693
00:51:16,459 --> 00:51:18,172
Scott: because well Oh here is a picture of it.

694
00:51:18,213 --> 00:51:24,720
Scott: Yeah, it's it's a It's like a. yeah, it's like a little stick and it looks like a hamburger with bars around.

695
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:27,973
Scott: Yeah, right and then there's a. there's a little hat.

696
00:51:27,993 --> 00:51:29,740
Scott: So it looks like a policeman hamburger.

697
00:51:29,841 --> 00:51:31,433
Scott: I guess he's gonna catch the hamburgers.

698
00:51:31,453 --> 00:51:32,400
Rym: I forget that character's name.

699
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:33,825
Rym: That was the character that would catch the hamburglar.

700
00:51:34,066 --> 00:51:34,407
Rym: that the way.

701
00:51:34,447 --> 00:51:36,154
Rym: an exact same thing at the McDonald's.

702
00:51:36,455 --> 00:51:44,260
Rym: and then the major magics Near us had the exact same toy that had clearly been repainted to not be McDonald's branded anymore.

703
00:51:45,582 --> 00:51:48,598
Rym: I don't know if they like bought it from a McDonald's that was renovating or something.

704
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:53,086
Rym: Alrighty Alright, I think we've killed enough times.

705
00:51:53,126 --> 00:51:53,709
Rym: It's been an hour.

706
00:51:53,729 --> 00:52:02,789
Rym: I uh, I kind of wish I could play in playgrounds, but I understand why Playgrounds ban adults from going into them.

707
00:52:02,829 --> 00:52:09,480
Rym: because for every room and Scott who just want to go swing on the swings There are definitely some some other people who should not be in that playground.

708
00:52:10,483 --> 00:52:12,460
Scott: You should not be anywhere near that place exactly.

709
00:52:17,182 --> 00:52:19,720
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

710
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:24,540
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.
