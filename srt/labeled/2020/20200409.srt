1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,268
Rym: It's Thursday, April 9th, 2020.

2
00:00:10,268 --> 00:00:12,033
Rym: I'm Rym, and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:21,100
Rym: Tonight, we are talking about chili, the food, coming to you live from our remote quarantine pipeline studios.

4
00:00:23,102 --> 00:00:24,118
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:36,536
Rym: So, uh, yeah, the funniest thing about this quarantine for me, like, just the fact that we're not going out and everything's shut down, is that I'm not eating out.

6
00:00:37,178 --> 00:00:44,550
Rym: Like, I now realize- How much fucking money I spent eating out on, like, a monthly basis.

7
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,770
Scott: Yeah, you spent a ton, especially on booze every time you ate out.

8
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:48,190
Rym: Yup.

9
00:00:48,591 --> 00:00:56,090
Rym: But also, I'm finding that because we're cooking, we're cooking much healthier food than I normally eat in my, like, day-to-day life.

10
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,147
Scott: I'm like, I don't know if I'm cooking healthier or not.

11
00:00:59,612 --> 00:01:05,410
Scott: Yeah, we're definitely cooking healthy, and- I think part of it is that the cooking is perfectly normal and healthy, but the baking, right?

12
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:09,809
Scott: It's like, "Oh, I can just bake a banana bread, and then I'll bake

13
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:09,909
Scott: it.".

14
00:01:11,012 --> 00:01:14,746
Rym: We kind of had the revelation of, "Why don't we just start baking a shit ton of

15
00:01:14,766 --> 00:01:15,208
Rym: cookies?".

16
00:01:15,832 --> 00:01:16,044
Scott: Yup.

17
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:21,950
Rym: We even got a bunch of craisins left over that we can use to make, like, craisin shortbread cookies and everything.

18
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:22,895
Rym: Sure.

19
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:33,550
Rym: But because I'm not eating, like, snacks and garbage when I'm out, and we're not eating out all the time, and I'm still, like, exercising like normal, I've lost three pounds since this started.

20
00:01:34,996 --> 00:01:36,207
Scott: I don't know if I've lost any.

21
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:44,010
Scott: I guess because I'm not exercising, because basically it's, like, the time that I would exercise, like, say, commuting to work, right?

22
00:01:44,213 --> 00:01:44,424
Scott: Yup.

23
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,339
Scott: Instead of, you know, being like, "Well, I have all this free time now.

24
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:52,550
Scott: Let's, uh, you know, let's go for a bike ride before or after work," right?

25
00:01:53,094 --> 00:01:54,289
Scott: I mean, I would like to do that.

26
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,090
Scott: The problem is, you know, A, weather, but, you know, weather's been okay.

27
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:58,315
Scott: Yeah.

28
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:02,090
Scott: Is that that time has been spent just waking up later.

29
00:02:02,832 --> 00:02:03,055
Rym: Yup.

30
00:02:03,116 --> 00:02:06,120
Scott: No, I literally-- I just wake up at-- I used to wake up at seven.

31
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,070
Scott: Now I'm waking up at, like, nine to ten.

32
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,460
Rym: Every night I look at my, uh, work calendar-- I don't set an alarm anymore.

33
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,650
Scott: I just wake up whenever the hell.

34
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:18,650
Rym: Every night I look at my work calendar to figure out when my first meeting is, and I wake up eleven minutes before that meeting.

35
00:02:19,511 --> 00:02:19,592
Scott: Yup.

36
00:02:19,652 --> 00:02:20,156
Scott: Exactly.

37
00:02:20,277 --> 00:02:22,070
Scott: So it's, like, that's the time.

38
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:29,730
Scott: And the thing is, you know, my building has a little gym in it, uh, and I was actually literally finally about to use it.

39
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,154
Scott: Like, "Well, I'm trapped inside.

40
00:02:31,174 --> 00:02:36,870
Scott: I might as well actually use this gym that I would never otherwise use," right?

41
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:40,029
Scott: And I was about to go use it, and they closed it.

42
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,753
Rym: That sucks.

43
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:48,230
Rym: They're keeping ours open, but our building only has, like, 150 apartments, so there aren't that many people who would use it.

44
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:54,290
Rym: And they have rules about, like, there's two treadmills, only one person can be on either of them at any given time, and all that stuff.

45
00:02:55,171 --> 00:03:00,302
Scott: I'm just saying, just as I was like, "Alright, I find that I'll use this damn gym, Miigaw, because I'm trapped inside.

46
00:03:00,342 --> 00:03:03,488
Scott: I would never otherwise use a gym if it wasn't such an extraordinary

47
00:03:03,528 --> 00:03:04,150
Scott: circumstance.".

48
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:04,431
Scott: Yup.

49
00:03:04,653 --> 00:03:06,828
Scott: Okay, we'll close that gym right before we use it, and it's like,

50
00:03:06,868 --> 00:03:07,049
Scott: "Pah!".

51
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,304
Rym: I mean, look, I'm a crazy runner.

52
00:03:09,344 --> 00:03:11,075
Scott: Like, I exercise-- There's a sauna in there.

53
00:03:11,115 --> 00:03:13,410
Scott: I could be in that sauna, like, as soon as my work is over.

54
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:18,683
Rym: I, uh, like, crazy run, but I hate running on treadmills.

55
00:03:18,783 --> 00:03:21,270
Rym: I hate it to a degree that is palpable.

56
00:03:21,693 --> 00:03:23,403
Rym: But, what else am I gonna do in the winter?

57
00:03:23,483 --> 00:03:24,590
Rym: Like, it's either that or nothing.

58
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:26,829
Scott: But yeah, they closed it, so.

59
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,135
Rym: Yup, that sucks.

60
00:03:28,437 --> 00:03:29,463
Rym: It's getting warm out, though.

61
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:33,805
Scott: It's gonna be sunny-- It's like, the governor ordered gyms to be closed, so we're closing it, and I'm like,

62
00:03:33,885 --> 00:03:34,046
Scott: "Okay.".

63
00:03:35,191 --> 00:03:40,810
Rym: Uh, so technically, as far as I know, the governor only ordered, like, public gyms to be closed.

64
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,945
Scott: I'm aware of that, but that's not what, you know, the building did.

65
00:03:43,985 --> 00:03:44,910
Scott: what the building's gonna do.

66
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:45,351
Scott: Yup.

67
00:03:45,853 --> 00:03:47,480
Rym: Our building's different for now, but we'll see.

68
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:55,730
Rym: Hopefully they don't close it on me, 'cause that's-- The one thing I got rid of when we moved to this building 11 years ago is I got rid of all my weights, because there's weights down there.

69
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:56,899
Rym: Now I don't have any weights.

70
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,899
Scott: The only way to do weightlifting-- When I moved here, I got rid of my-- I got rid of-- It was kind of broken.

71
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,023
Scott: I mean, it wasn't broken.

72
00:04:02,063 --> 00:04:04,330
Scott: It worked, but it wasn't, uh, great.

73
00:04:04,871 --> 00:04:07,690
Scott: The thing where I could ride my actual bike in place.

74
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:08,349
Rym: Yup, yup.

75
00:04:09,112 --> 00:04:11,149
Scott: And, uh, yeah, good luck buying one of those now.

76
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,114
Rym: Oh, God, right?

77
00:04:12,194 --> 00:04:15,670
Rym: I wanted to buy-- I thought about buying new free weights, just, like, during this crisis.

78
00:04:16,051 --> 00:04:17,656
Rym: Yeah, they are gone everywhere.

79
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:18,759
Rym: Those are impossible to get.

80
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:22,530
Rym: I should just try to buy something heavy, like two buckets, and just start using that.

81
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:28,401
Scott: Right, even if I were to buy one of the fancy ones that goes with my bike computer, right?

82
00:04:28,762 --> 00:04:32,110
Scott: Like the, uh, it's like, okay, are these in stock anywhere?

83
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:32,450
Scott: Yup.

84
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,643
Scott: They're a thousand dollars anyway, right?

85
00:04:34,784 --> 00:04:44,068
Rym: It's like-- Yeah, I found the thing-- the crazy expensive versions of a lot of these things are still in stock, but even now, I don't really-- Ooh, the certified reconditioned ones.

86
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:44,654
Rym: Ooh.

87
00:04:46,074 --> 00:04:46,870
Scott: But they're still a fortune.

88
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,492
Rym: Yeah, that's a problem.

89
00:04:48,633 --> 00:04:50,997
Rym: Even outside of a crisis, things like that are a fortune.

90
00:04:51,017 --> 00:04:51,638
Rym: There's a lot of things.

91
00:04:51,738 --> 00:04:55,264
Rym: I thought, oh, maybe now's the time to buy, but then I look at the price, and I'm like, you know what?

92
00:04:55,865 --> 00:04:57,087
Rym: Even-- I think I can still wait.

93
00:04:57,107 --> 00:04:58,470
Rym: I think I can still hold out.

94
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:00,818
Scott: Yeah, $1,200.

95
00:05:00,818 --> 00:05:02,410
Scott: It's like, yeah, I could just buy another bicycle.

96
00:05:03,691 --> 00:05:07,890
Rym: So what do you got news-wise on this lounge episode of GeekNights?

97
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:12,750
Scott: Sure, it's sort of thing of the day adjacent, but it's also news adjacent, right?

98
00:05:14,413 --> 00:05:15,280
Scott: The date on this is what?

99
00:05:15,341 --> 00:05:15,623
Scott: April 8th.

100
00:05:15,643 --> 00:05:16,530
Scott: Yeah, this is from yesterday.

101
00:05:18,391 --> 00:05:25,122
Scott: So sometime on Wednesday, which I guess, you know, today's Thursday.

102
00:05:25,142 --> 00:05:27,166
Scott: Is that Wednesday for astronaut's time?

103
00:05:27,406 --> 00:05:28,187
Scott: Oh, okay, never mind.

104
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,590
Scott: It was sometime yesterday.

105
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,613
Scott: There's some space action going on, right?

106
00:05:37,015 --> 00:05:42,141
Scott: Oh, no, the launch is Thursday at 1.05 local time.

107
00:05:42,181 --> 00:05:43,362
Scott: Oh, did the launch happen already?

108
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:49,449
Scott: Anyway, Russians launch in a rocket to send some Americans and two Russians into space, right?

109
00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:50,010
Scott: Like you do.

110
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:54,641
Scott: So they were in quarantine, which you do when you're an astronaut anyway.

111
00:05:54,661 --> 00:05:57,810
Scott: It's not an unusual circumstance.

112
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:58,197
Scott: Yep.

113
00:05:58,532 --> 00:06:00,990
Scott: I'm sure they did not bring coronavirus into space.

114
00:06:01,651 --> 00:06:04,430
Rym: Yep, that's part of what being an astronaut or a cosmonaut is.

115
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:08,316
Scott: Yeah, I'm sure they didn't do that, but there's a story here about.

116
00:06:08,376 --> 00:06:15,470
Scott: apparently when you go to space in Russia at Baikonur, I never knew how to pronounce that name of that place.

117
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:18,950
Rym: Don't even, Cyrillic, I can't read at all.

118
00:06:20,011 --> 00:06:22,899
Scott: It's the place of the, it's basically the Cape Canaveral of Russia.

119
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:25,707
Scott: If you've never heard of it before, that's like their place, right?

120
00:06:25,727 --> 00:06:26,690
Scott: Where they launch all their rockets.

121
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:27,227
Rym: Yeah, in Kazakhstan.

122
00:06:28,111 --> 00:06:41,390
Scott: Yeah, whenever you launch from there, apparently it's mandatory that the day before launch when you're in the cosmonaut quarantine hotel, you must watch this movie like they make you watch it.

123
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:43,030
Rym: That's kind of amazing.

124
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:44,893
Scott: Right, it's mandatory.

125
00:06:44,954 --> 00:06:46,318
Scott: It's always the same movie.

126
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:50,450
Scott: It's an old Soviet film from the 70s called White Sun of the Desert.

127
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:51,838
Rym: Oh, I want to see this now.

128
00:06:51,859 --> 00:06:53,410
Rym: Is this like the Soviet one?

129
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:54,658
Scott: This is my news.

130
00:06:54,819 --> 00:06:55,950
Scott: It's on YouTube with subtitles.

131
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,850
Rym: Is this like the Soviet Lawrence of Arabia?

132
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:03,306
Scott: It looks like Lawrence, I thought that the movie was Lawrence of Arabia, but apparently it's not.

133
00:07:03,386 --> 00:07:04,430
Scott: It's White Sun of the Desert.

134
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:10,485
Scott: It's a, um, but yeah, I am freaking watching this movie as soon as I get the chance.

135
00:07:10,525 --> 00:07:12,070
Scott: It's on YouTube for free with subtitles.

136
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,499
Rym: Hey, there's our next Thursday show.

137
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:15,170
Rym: Next Thursday, we're going to review this movie.

138
00:07:15,751 --> 00:07:18,050
Scott: White Sun of the Desert, two weeks from now, everybody.

139
00:07:18,411 --> 00:07:19,267
Rym: GeekNights Movie Club, let's go.

140
00:07:21,194 --> 00:07:22,669
Scott: I don't think it's actually going to be that good.

141
00:07:22,931 --> 00:07:28,670
Rym: Yeah, but looking at these stills, it looks like the kind of movie that I will enjoy.

142
00:07:29,691 --> 00:07:30,969
Scott: Oh yeah, but, you know.

143
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:35,690
Rym: I like, like, a really long, extremely dated, like, drama piece.

144
00:07:37,452 --> 00:07:39,770
Scott: Anyway, uh, here's a movie for you.

145
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:40,848
Rym: Oh, it's got some Western action.

146
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:44,149
Scott: And then after you finish watching it, you'll be cleared to go on the Soyuz.

147
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:47,706
Rym: The guy with the bolt-action rifle, like, firing from under his horse.

148
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:48,530
Rym: Yeah.

149
00:07:51,112 --> 00:07:51,733
Rym: I love that shit.

150
00:07:51,994 --> 00:07:58,170
Rym: I've been off and on on a Western kick over the last few years, but I've kind of run out of Westerns to watch.

151
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:01,390
Rym: So I've got to dig deeper into, like, older, weirder stuff.

152
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:07,870
Rym: So, uh, my news, if you don't know, Fark is a website, F-A-R-K dot com.

153
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:14,290
Rym: But the best way to describe Fark is it is Internet 2.0. before Internet 2.0 was really a thing.

154
00:08:16,531 --> 00:08:21,790
Scott: And it hasn't changed, so it's like going into the past of the Internet, but there's still people there?

155
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:27,690
Rym: Like, you know that thing, and the reason I'm bringing this up, the reason I think this is newsworthy, is not, like, I like Fark, but it's not just because I like Fark.

156
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:34,390
Rym: And I think Fark is actually moderately important, but I think it's important in a lot of the same ways that, like, something awful was important.

157
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:39,409
Rym: Or even 4chan in the early days was important, that it was kind of foundational to how the Internet culture formed.

158
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:41,590
Scott: Yeah, good, important being separate from good or bad.

159
00:08:41,751 --> 00:08:42,514
Scott: Exactly.

160
00:08:42,554 --> 00:08:46,450
Rym: There are a lot of important things that are not good, and a lot of good things that are not important.

161
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,569
Rym: That is a lesson you need to learn in life.

162
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:54,610
Rym: But Fark, for a lot of reasons, was and is to a degree still important.

163
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:58,529
Rym: But the deal with Fark is that there was nothing like it.

164
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:07,430
Rym: And when it came out, it was sort of like a revolutionary idea of how to do a community online, centered around news and current events.

165
00:09:07,931 --> 00:09:17,230
Rym: And somehow, while Reddit and 4chan and something awful and YouTube and all these other places descended into- Well, Slashdot was very Fark-esque.

166
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:18,348
Rym: Oh yeah, Slashdot was too.

167
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,550
Scott: I'm pretty sure Slashdot was older.

168
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:21,910
Rym: But Slashdot is also in the category.

169
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:26,250
Scott: And then there were many, many sites that tried to do the same thing, like Dig and whatnot.

170
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:27,690
Scott: Fark is older than Dig, obviously.

171
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:27,992
Rym: Yep.

172
00:09:28,237 --> 00:09:28,748
Rym: Remember Memepool?

173
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:30,735
Scott: Right, right, exactly.

174
00:09:30,755 --> 00:09:33,590
Scott: Well, Memepool was a little slower, and I think it was one person?

175
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:37,324
Rym: Yeah, Memepool was a blast from the past.

176
00:09:37,545 --> 00:09:38,850
Rym: That was a product of its era.

177
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:50,670
Scott: But it basically is these sites that would be aggregators of news that were manual aggregation to a large extent, but not editorial.

178
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:51,348
Rym: Yep.

179
00:09:51,610 --> 00:10:00,930
Scott: And also somewhat crowdsourced the aggregation, but not to the extent where, say, Reddit does.

180
00:10:01,356 --> 00:10:01,510
Scott: Exactly.

181
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:03,610
Rym: Where it's completely automated, right?

182
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:06,830
Rym: But distinct and, in many cases, overlapping communities.

183
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:20,870
Rym: But just to look at Slashdot versus Fark as an example, Slashdot, as the decades went on, has become increasingly old, embittered, MRA, white, shitty, Nazi shitbags.

184
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,930
Rym: The people who use Slashdot are awful people today.

185
00:10:24,331 --> 00:10:24,472
Scott: Right.

186
00:10:24,492 --> 00:10:28,489
Scott: Well, it's the worst old white guys in tech culture, right?

187
00:10:29,394 --> 00:10:29,544
Scott: Yep.

188
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:41,990
Scott: And everyone else in the tech scene who was checking Slashdot, because that was the tech news site of the day, has left, and those are the only people who are still there are the ones who are old bad white guys.

189
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:42,630
Rym: Yep.

190
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:46,222
Rym: But Fark is unique in that that never happened to Fark.

191
00:10:46,282 --> 00:10:48,550
Rym: Fark has younger people and older people using it.

192
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:59,510
Rym: In terms of online communities that are centered on broad topics and just topical news, look at any generic Reddit and it's a goddamn shit show.

193
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:04,730
Rym: The only good Reddits are the hyper-specific ones, or the ones that have very communities around a particular thing.

194
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:17,570
Rym: But Fark is one of the broader large internet communities, and it's kind of amazing how much of a local culture it has in an era when there really aren't that many websites anymore.

195
00:11:18,293 --> 00:11:21,628
Scott: Well, I think it's simultaneously broad, but also not.

196
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:23,614
Rym: Yeah, it's like a niche.

197
00:11:23,654 --> 00:11:28,690
Rym: take on people who are interested in policy and pay attention to weird news.

198
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:29,571
Scott: Right.

199
00:11:29,591 --> 00:11:31,482
Scott: Fark is about the news, which is huge.

200
00:11:31,523 --> 00:11:32,710
Scott: Like, any news goes.

201
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:33,081
Scott: Yeah.

202
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:39,670
Scott: But the kind of news that Fark actually cares about is actually a specific subset of news.

203
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:45,590
Scott: It just looks broad because that slice slices across the whole watermelon.

204
00:11:46,492 --> 00:11:47,654
Rym: Like, you think Florida Man.

205
00:11:47,695 --> 00:11:54,790
Rym: Florida Man, like, that meme partly came directly from Fark, but Fark is where you see the Florida Man of the entire Earth.

206
00:11:55,550 --> 00:12:03,770
Scott: Right, so for example, right, on Fark, Fark will very, very much enjoy news about injustice, right?

207
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:09,310
Scott: But you'll see news about injustice from every country, every place, every kind of injustice.

208
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:09,597
Scott: Yep.

209
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:10,331
Scott: Right?

210
00:12:10,633 --> 00:12:13,250
Scott: You know, it enjoys a wacky news, right?

211
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:21,368
Scott: Something that's, you know, a man eaten by, you know, a tiger bites a dude's foot off in a submarine or something.

212
00:12:21,388 --> 00:12:22,210
Scott: Something crazy, right?

213
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:25,960
Scott: It's like, but it'll do crazy things from everywhere.

214
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:29,170
Scott: So it's really, Fark likes a few specific things.

215
00:12:29,692 --> 00:12:32,390
Scott: It also just posts the biggest news story of the day.

216
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:36,230
Rym: But that's another thing is it's like this community and it's just like all fun and games.

217
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:45,841
Rym: And it hasn't descended into Nazi hellhole like a lot of other communities have due to a really robust system of moderation that a lot like.

218
00:12:45,941 --> 00:12:53,610
Rym: I'm really kind of amazed at how relatively civil the conversations are in Fark to this day compared to almost any other broad community on the Internet.

219
00:12:54,371 --> 00:13:03,930
Scott: Well, I think that's because, you know, Fark is sort of like, you know, all the other ones have some, a greater idea of like openness.

220
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:07,604
Scott: Whereas Fark is more along the lines of a Craigslist, right?

221
00:13:07,624 --> 00:13:08,730
Scott: It's owned by one guy.

222
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,910
Rym: He just gets to say, he can just be like, no Nazis.

223
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,770
Scott: Because Craigslist is owned by Craig, Fark is owned by this Drew guy.

224
00:13:14,051 --> 00:13:14,570
Rym: Yep, Drew Curtis.

225
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:15,796
Scott: It's just owned by a guy.

226
00:13:15,816 --> 00:13:18,309
Scott: They run it right there in charge of it.

227
00:13:18,651 --> 00:13:23,310
Scott: You can comment there, you can post content there, but it's run by the guy.

228
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:36,389
Scott: There's not, there isn't this expectation of, you know, culturally and in the community wise, there isn't this feeling of, you know, I have rights to post here, right?

229
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:40,190
Rym: They will ban people if they need to be banned.

230
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:52,310
Rym: And the other thing is Fark was actually really ahead of most of the rest of the Internet in terms of community safety tools like blocking and shadow banning and automated moderation.

231
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,489
Rym: Like Fark really pushed the envelope in a lot of this stuff.

232
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:58,560
Scott: Well, because unlike the other places, say like Reddit, right?

233
00:13:58,941 --> 00:14:02,450
Scott: They're outsourcing that stuff to the, you know, to the community.

234
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:05,858
Scott: Like here at Reddit, you start your own subreddit and moderate it, right?

235
00:14:05,899 --> 00:14:10,490
Scott: Slashdot is like, hey everyone, up and down vote stuff to moderate and report for us.

236
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:11,292
Scott: We don't want to, right?

237
00:14:11,733 --> 00:14:18,330
Scott: Whereas Fark is doing it themselves and when you have to do something yourself with your own company and your own money, you build tooling.

238
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,890
Rym: Yep, and you also by having a strong community.

239
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:24,310
Scott: There's less motivation to build tooling when someone else is doing the work for free.

240
00:14:24,551 --> 00:14:24,812
Rym: Yep.

241
00:14:25,534 --> 00:14:26,658
Rym: So I read Fark.

242
00:14:26,738 --> 00:14:29,568
Rym: I've read Fark for like more than 20 years.

243
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,089
Scott: Your whole life?

244
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:36,387
Rym: Pretty much my whole adult life I've been reading Fark daily and like I like this community.

245
00:14:36,427 --> 00:14:37,290
Rym: I like the people in it.

246
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:45,169
Rym: I don't like all the people in it, but whenever I encounter a shitty person, I use those tools that still exist and they disappear forever and I just never see them again.

247
00:14:46,272 --> 00:14:54,170
Rym: But Fark is in trouble because the reason why we keep saying things like, you know, that common theme, there used to be more websites.

248
00:14:54,830 --> 00:15:03,867
Rym: Independent websites like CollegeHumor, like places where people would like make a community to make content have been vanishing for all the late capitalism reasons.

249
00:15:03,887 --> 00:15:05,290
Rym: we talk about a lot on GeekNights.

250
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:13,250
Scott: Well yeah, because if you're getting your aggregated stuff through a Twitter feed or a Facebook feed or any of those other Instagram, right?

251
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:17,183
Scott: When you are in those places, you're largely staying in those places.

252
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:19,050
Scott: Those do a lot of embedded content.

253
00:15:19,631 --> 00:15:25,390
Scott: You have a Twitter thread rather than a Twitter with a link to a blog post, right?

254
00:15:25,711 --> 00:15:35,590
Scott: Things like that, whereas Fark, since it hasn't changed, is still almost all the posts on there are, you know, even on Reddit, it's like you go to a subreddit.

255
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:40,021
Scott: Yeah, some of the stuff is a link somewhere, but a lot of the posts on Reddit are.

256
00:15:40,241 --> 00:15:41,946
Scott: I uploaded a video to the Reddit.

257
00:15:42,046 --> 00:15:43,570
Scott: I uploaded the image to the Reddit.

258
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,135
Scott: I wrote a text post on the Reddit.

259
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,498
Scott: That's the post, right?

260
00:15:47,538 --> 00:15:52,870
Scott: Whereas on Fark, everything is a link usually to some local newspaper or local TV station.

261
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:59,370
Rym: Fark actually is a significant source of how people find real news, especially during a crisis.

262
00:16:00,551 --> 00:16:17,230
Rym: I remember during on 9/11 or during the hurricane in Louisiana and all that, Fark was in some cases hours ahead of the regular news media because Fark is a wide community, so there are people who are on the scene of fucking anything that happens around the world.

263
00:16:17,611 --> 00:16:22,008
Rym: I see stuff on Fark sometimes before I see it on like a Bloomberg terminal.

264
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:22,650
Rym: It's kind of amazing.

265
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:27,255
Scott: And also, there's a lot of people who use Fark and don't credit it appropriately.

266
00:16:27,276 --> 00:16:37,829
Scott: I remember when I was in college and I would do a short drive from, you know, our apartment to the one parking lot I was allowed to park in.

267
00:16:38,551 --> 00:16:46,250
Scott: I would sometimes, you know, in those days, we didn't have podcasts, so I would still have to listen to local radio guy.

268
00:16:47,370 --> 00:17:05,210
Scott: And I could tell, 100% guaranteed, no question, there was no doubt in my mind, local radio guy, literally, he might not have even known that he was doing this because his writer or his producer was doing it, but basically getting stories from Fark, probably printing them out and handing them to him.

269
00:17:05,751 --> 00:17:11,608
Scott: And then that's what they would discuss on the show is they would go through the wacky stories on Fark like, "Hey, did you hear a Florida man did this?

270
00:17:11,688 --> 00:17:11,929
Scott: Hey, did

271
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:12,029
Scott: you?"

272
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:12,270
Scott: Right?

273
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:15,179
Scott: And I was like, "Those are all the headlines on Fark right now.

274
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:15,840
Scott: Open up Fark.

275
00:17:15,881 --> 00:17:17,426
Scott: He's literally going down from the

276
00:17:17,467 --> 00:17:17,768
Scott: bottom.".

277
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:18,410
Scott: Right?

278
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:23,900
Scott: There are still lots of people out there producing other content in that exact same way.

279
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:29,670
Scott: There are definitely still local radio, zoo shows that are just going down Fark.

280
00:17:30,271 --> 00:17:32,030
Rym: So why am I talking about Fark so much?

281
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:33,329
Scott: Because their listeners don't know Fark.

282
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:37,700
Rym: Partly because I'm old and the Fark demographic is definitely a little older.

283
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,290
Rym: When it comes to politics, people seem to know more in there than the general population.

284
00:17:42,031 --> 00:17:46,705
Scott: Fark is not doing great at getting new people because it's such an old thing.

285
00:17:46,725 --> 00:17:48,290
Scott: Not like it's advertising.

286
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:49,434
Rym: But it does still grow.

287
00:17:49,614 --> 00:17:51,523
Rym: There are people younger than me there.

288
00:17:51,683 --> 00:17:53,230
Rym: More of them than you would expect.

289
00:17:53,570 --> 00:18:08,190
Rym: The reason I'm talking about Fark is that somehow Fark has survived so long and they're on the verge of failing now between the virus and ad revenue dropping and subscriber numbers dropping for a lot of reasons.

290
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:12,689
Rym: Fark is actually running out of money and might have to shut down by the end of the year.

291
00:18:13,891 --> 00:18:16,384
Scott: I don't understand why you could just cut back.

292
00:18:16,444 --> 00:18:17,470
Scott: It's so cheap to run.

293
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,620
Rym: I think there's a bunch of plans.

294
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,183
Rym: This is kind of new news.

295
00:18:21,711 --> 00:18:23,549
Scott: I don't see why you'd ever have to shut it down.

296
00:18:24,251 --> 00:18:27,141
Rym: It uses a terrifying amount of bandwidth, for one.

297
00:18:27,623 --> 00:18:29,650
Rym: And our support staff that have to keep it all running.

298
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:35,170
Rym: It also has developers because it's a little janky and needs people to continuously update and fix things that are broken with it.

299
00:18:35,952 --> 00:18:39,190
Scott: If it's so old and it's been developed for so long, wouldn't it be just fine?

300
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,577
Rym: It's got some issues.

301
00:18:41,597 --> 00:18:42,802
Rym: You can read some of the details.

302
00:18:42,882 --> 00:18:44,970
Rym: I don't want to take the whole show and make it the Fark show.

303
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,921
Rym: But basically, you know, GeekNights has the newsletter.

304
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:50,030
Rym: That's just whenever Scott feels like it, he writes the newsletter.

305
00:18:50,553 --> 00:18:53,970
Rym: Drew Curtis has been doing that in Fark for a long time.

306
00:18:54,290 --> 00:19:01,550
Rym: I just get this email from Drew Curtis every now and then that just talks about, "Hey, here's the deal with Fark," or "Here's what I'm thinking today," or whatever.

307
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,659
Rym: And he's explaining that.

308
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,590
Rym: here's all the reasons why we're in trouble.

309
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:09,730
Rym: A website like this is very hard to continue to run in the modern world.

310
00:19:11,034 --> 00:19:12,561
Rym: One of the dangers is litigation risk.

311
00:19:12,822 --> 00:19:14,168
Rym: Sites like that get sued all the time.

312
00:19:16,092 --> 00:19:16,152
Scott: Mmm.

313
00:19:16,172 --> 00:19:17,930
Scott: Doesn't he have insurance of some kind?

314
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:20,189
Scott: Oh yeah, but-- We just talked about that, don't you?

315
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:26,410
Rym: Basically, if you are someone who has never used Fark before, I recommend just going and poking at it.

316
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:27,235
Rym: It might not be for you.

317
00:19:27,275 --> 00:19:29,469
Rym: I'm not saying you should use Fark, but just go look at it.

318
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:33,069
Scott: Because if nothing else-- You're probably benefiting from Fark indirectly without knowing it.

319
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:37,090
Rym: But it's also a time capsule into a different kind of internet.

320
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:40,585
Rym: It is a lot like what the internet was like in the early to mid-2000s.

321
00:19:41,811 --> 00:19:50,330
Scott: I think you'll be surprised if you do go to Fark that you'll go there, read it, and like an hour or two later, you'll see a lot of the things that were on there appearing on your Twitter feed.

322
00:19:51,151 --> 00:19:52,678
Scott: Like, "Oh, what?

323
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,205
Scott: I already read this somewhere.

324
00:19:54,245 --> 00:19:54,888
Scott: Where did I see

325
00:19:54,948 --> 00:19:55,129
Scott: this?".

326
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:58,310
Rym: But there's basically the other thing that I just want to point out.

327
00:19:59,153 --> 00:20:06,689
Rym: If you read Fark and like Fark, what I would recommend, much like with important news sites, they have a subscription service that does give you a bunch of stuff.

328
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:07,967
Scott: I thought they had two.

329
00:20:08,771 --> 00:20:12,650
Rym: Well, they have one that removes ads, but ad blockers work.

330
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:16,069
Rym: They've never stopped ad blockers from working because they're not evil, they know.

331
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:19,190
Rym: But two, you can pay for total Fark.

332
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,219
Scott: It's not that expensive.

333
00:20:21,461 --> 00:20:22,389
Rym: I'm paying for it now.

334
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:24,285
Scott: You could pay for it because you want to pay for Fark.

335
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:25,614
Rym: But don't use it.

336
00:20:25,655 --> 00:20:28,128
Rym: If you use it, it's like serotonin straight into--.

337
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:31,690
Scott: The thing that they give you that you're paying for is not a thing you want.

338
00:20:31,911 --> 00:20:38,709
Rym: It's a thing that you want if you work in a job where there is no actual work and you're literally just sitting at a desk reading Fark all day.

339
00:20:39,591 --> 00:20:42,608
Rym: That is the kind of person who pays for total Fark and uses it.

340
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:47,450
Rym: But if you use Fark at all, that is a way to give them money.

341
00:20:47,971 --> 00:21:01,050
Rym: And if they get enough subscribers, they can probably continue to run for a long time to come without getting bought out, shutting down, or having to make the kinds of compromises that sites like Slashdot have made that have turned them into hell holes.

342
00:21:02,712 --> 00:21:05,109
Rym: So I care a lot about Fark, so I'm just putting this out there.

343
00:21:05,311 --> 00:21:06,135
Scott: Yeah.

344
00:21:06,195 --> 00:21:07,662
Scott: Rym is basically Fark the person.

345
00:21:07,702 --> 00:21:09,310
Scott: If you read a lot of Fark, you'll turn into a Rym.

346
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:09,811
Scott: Yep.

347
00:21:10,233 --> 00:21:10,554
Scott: Fark.

348
00:21:10,775 --> 00:21:11,478
Rym: Poop Report.

349
00:21:11,538 --> 00:21:24,558
Rym: Not that I've read Poop Report in a decade, but... But anyway, things of the day.

350
00:21:24,838 --> 00:21:25,538
Rym: So check this out.

351
00:21:25,598 --> 00:21:27,320
Rym: There's a video in this tweet.

352
00:21:28,301 --> 00:21:29,528
Rym: It's from South Korea.

353
00:21:29,548 --> 00:21:33,529
Rym: I haven't researched this or looked into the deal with it yet, but it's a highway.

354
00:21:34,494 --> 00:21:35,620
Rym: And in the middle of the highway--.

355
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:36,153
Scott: Oh, I've seen this.

356
00:21:36,173 --> 00:21:36,419
Scott: It's real.

357
00:21:36,681 --> 00:21:37,444
Rym: There's a median.

358
00:21:38,087 --> 00:21:41,320
Rym: And in the US, when there's a median in a highway, it's just grass, usually.

359
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,600
Rym: But this highway in the middle is a really good, really wide bike lane.

360
00:21:46,461 --> 00:21:48,996
Rym: But that's not notable because Australia has stuff like that.

361
00:21:49,037 --> 00:21:49,600
Rym: You can just ride.

362
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,280
Scott: The ones we saw in person in Australia were on the side of the highway.

363
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,608
Rym: Yeah, they are in the middle in some cases.

364
00:21:55,769 --> 00:21:58,600
Rym: I've driven a lot more in Australia than you because I've been there.

365
00:21:59,202 --> 00:21:59,920
Scott: You saw middle ones?

366
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,944
Rym: Yeah, I saw middle ones, too.

367
00:22:01,888 --> 00:22:04,700
Rym: God, I've been to Australia a lot of times now that I'm thinking back.

368
00:22:05,081 --> 00:22:08,008
Rym: But anyway, so here's one in South Korea.

369
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:12,460
Rym: But the cool part about this is that the bike lane is in the middle.

370
00:22:12,901 --> 00:22:15,326
Rym: It's aimed at commuters and long-distance cyclists.

371
00:22:15,828 --> 00:22:21,060
Rym: The entire thing is covered, protecting you from the rain and the wind.

372
00:22:21,421 --> 00:22:27,580
Rym: And you're completely isolated from traffic because the roof is just miles and miles and miles and miles of solar panels.

373
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,606
Rym: Holy shit is this awesome.

374
00:22:30,887 --> 00:22:32,854
Rym: This is what the United States needs.

375
00:22:33,175 --> 00:22:34,640
Rym: I'm so sick of this fucking country.

376
00:22:35,301 --> 00:22:36,020
Scott: That's my thing of the day.

377
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:40,420
Scott: Other countries do smart, basic ideas, and the US doesn't do anything.

378
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,368
Scott: We're no longer a country that does the best stuff.

379
00:22:44,428 --> 00:22:48,220
Scott: we haven't been for quite a while, and people are just seeing it more and more every day.

380
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:55,419
Scott: They're like, "Yeah, the United States is not great at stuff because you kept electing people who don't spend money to make nice

381
00:22:55,459 --> 00:22:55,700
Scott: things.".

382
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:01,920
Rym: And now, over the last three months, we've moved from being just kind of a shitty, falling-behind country to actively harming the rest of the world.

383
00:23:04,301 --> 00:23:09,840
Rym: More so than when we overthrew peaceful socialist governments to replace them with dictators in the '70s, but I digress.

384
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,025
Scott: I mean, we had stuff, right?

385
00:23:12,065 --> 00:23:17,700
Scott: We didn't pay to take care of the stuff, so we had a real fragile thing, and now a pandemic came along and broke it.

386
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,235
Scott: So now it's like, before, we had stuff that was just fragile and shitty.

387
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:22,240
Scott: Now our stuff's broken.

388
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,064
Rym: Well, what made America so powerful?

389
00:23:24,805 --> 00:23:31,920
Rym: Much of the rest of the industrialized world got bombed that one time when we didn't get bombed, and we were just there, ready to profit from it.

390
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,980
Rym: That's the main reason the US was so prosperous for so long.

391
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,138
Scott: Pretty much, yeah.

392
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,137
Scott: So what do you got?

393
00:23:38,587 --> 00:23:39,200
Scott: What do I have?

394
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:39,696
Scott: So hot!

395
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,324
Scott: Yeah, so hot.

396
00:23:41,404 --> 00:23:44,140
Scott: So I posted this in our forum, which you should join.

397
00:23:45,442 --> 00:23:55,280
Scott: But since there's a coronavirus going on in South Korea, which Rym just mentioned is all smart, at least smarter than other places with regards to that, they were shutting things down.

398
00:23:55,841 --> 00:24:02,760
Scott: The K-pop scene was shutting down way before anything was going on in the US, like several weeks before we did anything.

399
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:10,158
Scott: I was at PAX East, and there were K-pop groups performing their songs to empty rooms because they were like, "Nope, no more crowds.

400
00:24:10,218 --> 00:24:10,399
Scott: GG.".

401
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,191
Scott: That's it.

402
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:26,559
Scott: So if you don't know, K-pop people, one of their things that they do really well is they post lots and lots of video content constantly to keep their fans well-fed and give them all kinds of things constantly.

403
00:24:28,601 --> 00:24:34,880
Scott: As opposed to, say, J-pop, where if you're not in Japan, you're getting something never, and you have to pay for it.

404
00:24:35,741 --> 00:24:45,760
Scott: So they're running out of stuff to post, obviously, because everyone's locked in somewhere, usually not with video equipment or video editors.

405
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:57,398
Scott: So here on the JYP channel, they reposted an old video that I'd seen before, but the one that I saw before was not as complete and was not as good quality as this.

406
00:24:59,422 --> 00:25:06,460
Scott: So what this is, a video of the person, the JYP, who's an interesting person if you look him up.

407
00:25:08,061 --> 00:25:16,740
Scott: He's written many hit songs over the years, and one of the hit songs he wrote, one of the biggest hits was "So Hot" for the Wonder Girls, the song he wrote.

408
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:21,300
Scott: And in this video, he shows you exactly how he made that song.

409
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:27,213
Scott: He's only like two to four measures of the song, like the main part of the song.

410
00:25:27,253 --> 00:25:30,700
Scott: He shows you exactly how he made it piece by piece, instrument by instrument.

411
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:36,857
Scott: And it's only a small part of the song, but basically, that's the song.

412
00:25:39,264 --> 00:25:41,600
Scott: The song is that over and over with a little bit of this and that.

413
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,202
Rym: You know what it's like?

414
00:25:42,242 --> 00:25:43,908
Rym: It's like, what's a 2Mix song?

415
00:25:43,968 --> 00:25:47,520
Rym: There's a duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh, then just repeat that forever.

416
00:25:48,061 --> 00:25:58,899
Scott: Right, but it's fascinating, I think, to someone who is, if you're not a songwriter, you're thinking, "Okay, I understand conceptually how you write the song, but really, how do you write a

417
00:25:58,959 --> 00:25:59,320
Scott: song?".

418
00:26:00,002 --> 00:26:00,764
Scott: Like, how?

419
00:26:01,025 --> 00:26:01,286
Scott: Right?

420
00:26:02,791 --> 00:26:05,360
Scott: After you watch this, you will never ask that question again.

421
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,826
Scott: You will say, "Oh, that's how you write a song,".

422
00:26:07,967 --> 00:26:10,975
Scott: and then you'll hear him do a little bit of the ways into it.

423
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,986
Scott: You'll be like, "I can do this.

424
00:26:14,147 --> 00:26:14,529
Scott: I could be a

425
00:26:14,549 --> 00:26:15,172
Scott: songwriter.".

426
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:16,519
Scott: And then you'll be like, "No, I

427
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:16,760
Scott: can't.".

428
00:26:18,941 --> 00:26:25,020
Rym: One thing I love is seeing different artists process for writing songs, because it's all over the place.

429
00:26:25,681 --> 00:26:28,140
Rym: Writing a symphony is very different from writing a pop song.

430
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,245
Scott: Well, yeah, this is the pop song process.

431
00:26:30,625 --> 00:26:36,520
Scott: And it's also great to see in this video, because he's got a Power Mac over there on the side or something.

432
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:37,579
Scott: Oh, wow, yeah.

433
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:42,640
Scott: This is from, like, you know, 2000... I guess the song came out in 2000?

434
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,240
Rym: Oh, look at all those synth boxes.

435
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:48,734
Scott: Yeah, the song is 10 or 11 years old, maybe, I think.

436
00:26:49,116 --> 00:26:50,140
Scott: It's at least 10 years old.

437
00:26:51,641 --> 00:26:57,900
Scott: And then he must have made this video after the song became a hit, so this is probably a 10-ish year old video?

438
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:00,860
Rym: Oh, I see both the audio and the MIDI cables coming out of that keyboard.

439
00:27:01,741 --> 00:27:09,460
Scott: Yeah, he's basically just got, like, an old Mac, probably a Power PC Mac, I'm imagining, and a big old keyboard, right?

440
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,787
Scott: And a bunch of digital instruments.

441
00:27:10,808 --> 00:27:12,940
Scott: he can switch the keyboard to, right, with some MIDI.

442
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,827
Rym: You know, actually, I've realized something sad.

443
00:27:15,128 --> 00:27:23,915
Rym: As of when I got the new audio equipment and set up this whole new pipeline, I now have, in my apartment, zero ways to connect MIDI devices to my computer.

444
00:27:24,016 --> 00:27:25,219
Rym: There's no way to do it right now.

445
00:27:26,161 --> 00:27:26,998
Rym: That's the end of an era.

446
00:27:28,361 --> 00:27:30,440
Scott: I mean, if you're not writing songs, I don't think you need it.

447
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,800
Rym: I haven't written songs since music theory class in RIT or, like, high school.

448
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:35,979
Rym: And the songs I wrote sucked.

449
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,399
Scott: Yeah, well, the song he wrote was an all-time hit.

450
00:27:41,661 --> 00:27:46,800
Rym: In the meta moment, we ain't reading shit, 'cause we don't have commutes, so stay tuned on the book club.

451
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:48,565
Rym: We are streaming a lot.

452
00:27:48,786 --> 00:27:52,640
Rym: Follow us on YouTube and go to the GeekNights official/unofficial Discord.

453
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:56,800
Rym: Scott and me soon will just be streaming random games in there sometimes.

454
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,919
Rym: We're hanging out online, doing as much as we can.

455
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,967
Scott: Before mentioned GeekNights forum.

456
00:28:01,087 --> 00:28:02,553
Scott: Actually, there was a problem with the forum.

457
00:28:02,613 --> 00:28:03,777
Scott: It wasn't sending emails.

458
00:28:03,817 --> 00:28:04,279
Scott: I fixed that.

459
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:09,398
Scott: Which means some of you may have gotten a flood of emails that were in the backlog.

460
00:28:09,458 --> 00:28:09,820
Scott: I'm sorry.

461
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:10,172
Scott: Yup.

462
00:28:11,341 --> 00:28:13,166
Rym: You might have noticed, we're seeking comments.

463
00:28:13,246 --> 00:28:17,880
Rym: We are writing a new, clarified code of conduct for the GeekNights community as a whole.

464
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,839
Scott: Oh, yeah, we didn't actually pub--oh, we did publicly announce that, yeah.

465
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,615
Rym: Yeah, but I just want to remind you all, like, you can contribute to this.

466
00:28:23,675 --> 00:28:24,420
Rym: It's just in GitHub.

467
00:28:24,681 --> 00:28:28,920
Rym: I would love to hear your feedback, because we're two, like, middle-aged white guys.

468
00:28:29,881 --> 00:28:33,860
Rym: We need a lot of help to write a good code of conduct, because we definitely have blind spots.

469
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,407
Scott: Right, and I don't just want to steal someone else's.

470
00:28:36,467 --> 00:28:39,860
Scott: I want it to be one that's appropriate for our community and our beliefs.

471
00:28:40,041 --> 00:28:43,320
Scott: Even though I have stolen from many masters from other communities.

472
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:43,720
Scott: Yup.

473
00:28:44,241 --> 00:28:47,012
Scott: I went around and read a whole bunch of them to take what they were doing.

474
00:28:47,173 --> 00:28:48,900
Scott: that was good and put it into ours.

475
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,900
Scott: But, you know, we need feedback.

476
00:28:51,042 --> 00:28:51,978
Rym: And part of it is we don't--.

477
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:59,060
Scott: If you go to the forum, there should be a stickied post about the beta, you know, draft of the code of conduct.

478
00:28:59,201 --> 00:29:03,940
Scott: And you can go to the GitHub, and you can communicate with us however you're most comfortable with.

479
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,900
Scott: You can email us, you can post in the forum, you could make an issue on GitHub, you can make a pull request on GitHub.

480
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,700
Rym: Yup, try to find me on Discord and send me a message, like, whatever.

481
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:20,240
Scott: Yeah, you can DM me on Twitter, you can do whatever you want to comment about this code of conduct, because it's not in state yet.

482
00:29:20,594 --> 00:29:20,656
Scott: Yup.

483
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:29,800
Scott: But when it is, it will apply to not just our forum, even though that's primarily what it's for, it's also for literally every single GeekNights community thing.

484
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:33,480
Rym: Including the live stream on YouTube, which we are streaming right now.

485
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:40,200
Rym: We are streaming shows again, so if you stop paying attention to the YouTube channel, pay attention again, because there's 14 people watching this right now.

486
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,159
Rym: People are starting to come back.

487
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:49,380
Scott: Right, but if you were to say-- if we were to have a gaming meetup in the city or something, the code of conduct would be applying to that event as well, right?

488
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:58,440
Scott: So, if you ever-- if you're listening to GeekNights, if you ever want to participate in our community in any way, this is relevant to you and your interests.

489
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:06,420
Scott: And we want to make sure that, A, it is not something that is onerous and ruining your fun, if you're a good person.

490
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,920
Rym: Yup, but if you're a bad person, we 100% wanted to ruin your fun.

491
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,340
Scott: We wanted to make sure you have a bad time, because of this code of conduct.

492
00:30:13,701 --> 00:30:25,200
Scott: But also, we want to make sure that literally anybody on Earth who is a good person will see this code of conduct and they will feel safe enough to join in GeekNights.

493
00:30:25,361 --> 00:30:27,920
Scott: Not be afraid to come to GeekNights community events.

494
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:37,040
Scott: We want you to feel welcome and safe at any GeekNights thing, no matter what your situation is, if you're a good person and not a bad person.

495
00:30:37,921 --> 00:30:41,073
Rym: So, speaking of good and bad people, let's talk about Chili.

496
00:30:41,134 --> 00:30:42,580
Rym: I can't believe we haven't done a show on this.

497
00:30:43,261 --> 00:30:52,820
Scott: Well, so the thing with Chili, the food, right, is that I think because of the culture of the Chili cook-off, right?

498
00:30:53,361 --> 00:30:55,239
Rym: Yeah, which I'm a big fan of.

499
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:55,760
Scott: Right?

500
00:30:55,901 --> 00:31:01,340
Scott: There's this sort of-- unlike other foods, right, Chili has competition sort of built into it.

501
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:07,620
Scott: Whereas, I guess barbecue does a little bit, but it's really-- Chili is like the forefront of food that's competing.

502
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,640
Rym: Well, competing not-- There's also pie, pie contests.

503
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,221
Scott: You know what I'd say?

504
00:31:11,281 --> 00:31:20,360
Rym: There's contests for all these things, but Chili has a lot more, like, people will just kind of do a Chili cook-off on their own and sort of self-organize.

505
00:31:20,881 --> 00:31:24,190
Rym: Like, my work had a Chili cook-off recently, just randomly.

506
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:26,977
Rym: Like, all the engineering teams were like, "Let's make a Chili cook-off.

507
00:31:27,017 --> 00:31:27,399
Rym: Fuck it, let's

508
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:27,539
Rym: go.".

509
00:31:28,241 --> 00:31:37,058
Scott: Right, you know, the county fair will have contests for pies and things like that, but the Chili cook-off is really the preeminent American food competition.

510
00:31:38,505 --> 00:31:40,560
Rym: Also, Chili is one of my favorite foods.

511
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:55,280
Scott: Right, and that culture of competition around Chili, I think, results in this particular food being-- giving people very strong opinions about the right way, the wrong way, the better way, the worse way, what makes it good, what makes it bad.

512
00:31:55,621 --> 00:32:03,053
Scott: Like, how to score a Chili, right, on a cont-- I'm unwilling to talk about the true origins of Chili.

513
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:05,900
Rym: I don't care about the debate of whether or not beans are traditional.

514
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:15,600
Scott: I think the internet just says it came from, like, you know, working class, you know, Latinx people in Texas or something, right?

515
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:21,820
Rym: I mean, Wikipedia, in Spanish, the word "Chili" from the Nahatl "Chili" refers to a chili pepper.

516
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:23,680
Rym: Mm-hmm, yep.

517
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,745
Rym: There's the cowboy stuff, beans are not beans, but whatever.

518
00:32:26,805 --> 00:32:34,239
Rym: Really, what we're talking about are braised dishes that involve some combination of chili powders and--.

519
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:37,424
Rym: And then beyond this, this could be an "or" list, obviously.

520
00:32:37,864 --> 00:32:48,060
Rym: Beans, braised meats, other, like, onions, celeries, tofu's, but usually it's like a chili con carne with braised meat, tomato, and onions and stuff.

521
00:32:48,581 --> 00:33:07,200
Scott: Yeah, I mean, usually, but, yeah, it's just, it's a stew, right, and the stew is usually red and spicy and has a bunch of stuff in it, and it's such a wide variety of different things, meaning, like, this minimal, like, common factor that they all qualify as chili, right?

522
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:25,180
Scott: It's like, you can get a turkey chili with bean, you can get a vegetable chili, you can get a chili that doesn't even need tomato going on, you can get a chili with just, like, basically ground up, it's basically just your scooping ground up bits of meat that have been spiced and sauced lightly, right, or heavily.

523
00:33:26,561 --> 00:33:30,900
Rym: There are people who are already taking issue in the streaming chat with our inclusion of beans.

524
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,759
Scott: Yep, well, deal with it.

525
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:39,520
Rym: Yep, because when it comes to chili, I am not a purist at all, and I fucking love almost any kind of chili.

526
00:33:39,801 --> 00:33:40,662
Rym: Yeah, I mean, a

527
00:33:40,702 --> 00:33:56,560
Scott: lot of, like I said, a lot of people have these no true Scotsman arguments of what is chili, what is not chili, and you know what, I don't give a shit, I just care that it is delicious, and if I have to say the word chili to have someone bring that food to me so that I will eat it, then I will say that word, and I do not care.

528
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:01,440
Rym: Well, the same person is saying that tofu is bad, not because it's vegetarian, that's awesome, but because it's also beans.

529
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:09,719
Scott: Tofu is beans, that is correct, but it is also delicious, and I would welcome a tofu chili that is tasty.

530
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:17,960
Rym: But I think the main reason I like chili, my feelings on chili are primarily that the power of chili is that it's real hard to fuck up.

531
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:21,929
Rym: Even if you suck, you will make an edible, satisfying chili.

532
00:34:21,969 --> 00:34:26,179
Rym: Like, you have to really, really fuck up to make a chili that I wouldn't eat.

533
00:34:26,601 --> 00:34:37,000
Scott: But, if you're good at it, get chili mix at the grocery store, get the cheapest one, buy a meat and follow the instructions, and like, get a can of sauce, and you'll have a chili that is food.

534
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:41,500
Rym: And even if you mess it up, if you just let it sit long enough simmering, it'll eventually taste good.

535
00:34:42,701 --> 00:34:54,580
Rym: But, at the same time, if you understand the fundamentals of cooking braised dishes, then you don't need a recipe, like, you can just make any kind of chili and it'll always be good, not edible, but like, good.

536
00:34:55,701 --> 00:34:57,224
Rym: Because, there's not that much to it.

537
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:13,820
Rym: There's a chili recipe I've used for most of my life that basically is just how to make the three stages of preparing a chili, and I know what kinds of ingredients to put in at what part of the chili cooking process, and by following that rubric, I can make chili out of fucking anything.

538
00:35:15,563 --> 00:35:20,680
Scott: Well, I think that's also, right, that wide birth, girth.

539
00:35:20,984 --> 00:35:21,072
Rym: Yup.

540
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,630
Scott: No, birth, as in B-E-R-T-H.

541
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,059
Rym: We ain't talking about Gandalf.

542
00:35:26,761 --> 00:35:28,720
Scott: Yeah, the wide birth of things that could count.

543
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:31,159
Rym: That is an inside joke from a long time ago.

544
00:35:32,601 --> 00:35:40,840
Scott: The wide birth of things that could count as chili is also what leads towards, you know, back into that, you know, competitive scene.

545
00:35:41,321 --> 00:35:52,240
Scott: Right, because it's like if chili was one specific, like if you have a cheesecake competition, it's like, you can't have that much variety where things are still cheesecake, it's like different toppings, different flavors, how smooth is it, right?

546
00:35:52,882 --> 00:35:56,380
Scott: It's wide, but it's like, it's not chili wide, right?

547
00:35:56,420 --> 00:36:05,060
Scott: You can have chili with different meats, different sauce, different spice, hotter, less hot, bean, no bean, throw some vegetable in there, don't put some vegetable in there.

548
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,840
Rym: I like to use a primarily celery base.

549
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,237
Scott: A looser chili, a thicker chili, right?

550
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:15,540
Rym: It's very stew adjacent too, but I think the distinction is, chili, all chilis are stews, but not all stews are chilis.

551
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:28,000
Rym: I feel like the line there is just stew is put a bunch of shit in a pot, chili is put a bunch of shit in a pot, braise parts of it, and use at least some amount of chili peppers.

552
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,239
Scott: Alright, so some of my favorite chilis.

553
00:36:31,643 --> 00:36:32,299
Rym: Stu Leonard's chili?

554
00:36:32,821 --> 00:36:37,260
Scott: Stu Leonard's chili, so if you don't know, this is a grocery store, you may have mentioned it on GeekNights before.

555
00:36:37,823 --> 00:36:41,240
Scott: It is, I guess, Ripley's Believe It or Not says it's the world's largest dairy store.

556
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:48,860
Scott: It was owned by a guy, Stu Leonard, who got in trouble for tax evasion, and his son took over who got in trouble for something else, and I think his son is out of jail now?

557
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,159
Scott: I don't know who's running the store now.

558
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:54,280
Rym: When I met you, you would not shut up about this fucking Stu Leonard's, and I'd never heard of it.

559
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,240
Rym: But then I went to it.

560
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,980
Scott: Of course, if you were not from Michigan, you wouldn't hear of it.

561
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:03,600
Rym: No, but then I went to it, and I understood from that point on why you talked about it so much.

562
00:37:04,182 --> 00:37:08,540
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know, the way people talk about Trader Joe or Whole Foods, that's because they haven't been to Stu Leonard.

563
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:09,121
Scott: Yep.

564
00:37:09,141 --> 00:37:13,520
Rym: Well, like, maybe with roller coasters, the way people talk about Six Flags or Disney World, that's because they ain't been to Cedar Point.

565
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:19,980
Scott: But anyways, Stu Leonard, among the other things it has, which are off topic now, is that they make a lot of their own foods, right?

566
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:26,080
Scott: So, one of the foods you can buy there is their award-winning chicken chili with beans.

567
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,934
Scott: It comes in, you know, a plastic takeaway container.

568
00:37:28,974 --> 00:37:30,020
Scott: It's like a quart or whatever.

569
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:30,960
Rym: It's so good.

570
00:37:31,522 --> 00:37:32,519
Scott: It's so good.

571
00:37:33,186 --> 00:37:33,700
Rym: Every time.

572
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,459
Scott: There's a video on YouTube that shows you how to make it.

573
00:37:35,725 --> 00:37:36,140
Rym: Every time.

574
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,820
Scott: But I don't think you would make it as good as it is when you buy it at the store.

575
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,850
Scott: It's just refrigerated there in a plastic container.

576
00:37:43,151 --> 00:37:45,700
Scott: You take it home, you pour it out on top of something.

577
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,471
Scott: Some rice, maybe just a bowl of it.

578
00:37:47,492 --> 00:37:48,137
Scott: On top of anything.

579
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:56,680
Rym: For years, any time Scott and I drove within like 10 or 15 miles of Stu Leonard's, we would always deviate and go get some of this.

580
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:57,442
Scott: Yep.

581
00:37:58,092 --> 00:37:58,559
Scott: Why wouldn't you?

582
00:37:59,303 --> 00:38:00,629
Rym: And it's just like a solid chicken chili.

583
00:38:00,709 --> 00:38:03,100
Rym: Chicken chili is really underrated chili.

584
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:03,883
Rym: It's harder to make.

585
00:38:03,943 --> 00:38:08,240
Rym: well because you can kind of burn the chicken if you braise it the wrong way and it'll be kind of tough.

586
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:16,100
Scott: Well, I think one thing I've learned cooking chicken lately is I've pretty much, you know, it's like I already like dark meat better than white meat.

587
00:38:16,261 --> 00:38:17,440
Scott: That's not new, right?

588
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:26,360
Scott: But basically now I'm like, I've realized, I've sort of taken that thing I already knew, which is dark meat is better, and just been like, wait a minute, I know dark meat is better.

589
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,199
Scott: I've known that for a super long time.

590
00:38:28,701 --> 00:38:30,025
Scott: Why don't I go all in on that?

591
00:38:30,085 --> 00:38:35,500
Scott: So whenever I make chicken, almost any chicken thing I make, I'm making boneless skinless thighs.

592
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,916
Scott: Or getting boneless thighs and removing the bone, right?

593
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,740
Scott: And just, you know, so if I was going to make a chili, I would just go all thigh.

594
00:38:42,922 --> 00:38:42,989
Scott: Yep.

595
00:38:43,305 --> 00:38:43,480
Scott: Right.

596
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:49,460
Rym: Because you can make a chili with just like ground like white chicken, but you got to braise, you got to be careful with the braising.

597
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:56,037
Scott: Like you got to use more oil, you've got to like really- You got to spice that chicken to basically, you know, really season that chicken and keep it juicy.

598
00:38:57,041 --> 00:38:58,925
Rym: And you really got to deglaze.

599
00:38:58,965 --> 00:39:03,716
Rym: Like deglazing is important for like a beef chili, but with a chicken chili, if you don't deglaze, you're like all.

600
00:39:03,736 --> 00:39:05,400
Rym: the flavor is just going to be stuck to your pan.

601
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:06,876
Scott: Yep, yep, yep.

602
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,166
Rym: But that's, you know, the key to making a good chili.

603
00:39:10,286 --> 00:39:12,090
Rym: for me is the process of like.

604
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:16,480
Rym: the first thing you have to put into that bowl is you braise whatever meat you're going to use.

605
00:39:16,781 --> 00:39:22,740
Rym: If you're using tofu or something like that, that isn't like a primary meat, you don't put that in right away, you put that in way later.

606
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:30,640
Scott: You braise the meat- It's not a meat that's going to give off a lot of delicious fat when you braise it down.

607
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,679
Rym: Got to put that oil in there.

608
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,625
Scott: You got to add some oil, right?

609
00:39:33,645 --> 00:39:35,832
Scott: So if you get a tofu, you got to go with sesame oil.

610
00:39:35,872 --> 00:39:38,560
Scott: maybe, go for Asian style chili with the tofu, I don't know.

611
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,060
Rym: Ooh, I've never used sesame oil before.

612
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:41,823
Scott: Yeah, why not?

613
00:39:41,843 --> 00:39:44,020
Scott: You can make an Asian style, Asian fusion chili.

614
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:52,460
Rym: What I tend to do is I'll braise either cubed chunks of beef or ground beef and then I'll set it aside and without cleaning out the pot, I'll put in a bunch of oil.

615
00:39:52,901 --> 00:40:02,200
Rym: And usually, as much as I like to make the traditional like just a pile of onions for the base, I actually tend to use primarily celery, like one onion and two hunks of celery, like big hunks.

616
00:40:03,301 --> 00:40:08,620
Rym: And then I just braise that down until it's like unrecognizable mush and the whole pot is covered in fond.

617
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,704
Scott: Yeah, it's a lot like making curry, right?

618
00:40:10,724 --> 00:40:12,548
Scott: It's like I'm making curry from scratch.

619
00:40:12,728 --> 00:40:17,720
Scott: and I think, you know, all the really difference with the curry is that curry is like, okay, I take some onions, right?

620
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,306
Scott: Disintegrate them down into nothing, right?

621
00:40:20,607 --> 00:40:24,158
Scott: Get your braised, you know, boneless, skinless thighs in there, right?

622
00:40:24,298 --> 00:40:24,880
Scott: You know, whatever.

623
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:32,558
Scott: And the thing with the curry is that you go with water and then you put in, you know, your, what's the word for it?

624
00:40:32,578 --> 00:40:33,320
Scott: The butter flour.

625
00:40:33,902 --> 00:40:35,920
Rym: Oh, the, yeah, I know what you're talking about.

626
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:40,117
Scott: Yeah, you take butter and flour and you cook them together and you make whatever it is.

627
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:40,820
Scott: There's a word for it.

628
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:40,990
Scott: The roux?

629
00:40:41,762 --> 00:40:42,885
Scott: Yeah, the roux, right?

630
00:40:43,025 --> 00:40:48,780
Scott: And then you add the butter flour and then your spice, you know, whatever your curry spices are in with the butter flour.

631
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,740
Rym: But what Scott just said, that's mistake number one.

632
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:59,420
Rym: When you make a bad chili, a lot of times it's because you put the garlic or the spices in way too early when you're still cooking the base stuff and you burn and fuck up the spices and the garlic.

633
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:02,568
Scott: But I was saying, that's the difference between curry and chili, right?

634
00:41:02,588 --> 00:41:05,496
Scott: So curry is like, you know, you got your water, right?

635
00:41:05,616 --> 00:41:06,839
Scott: And then you roux it up.

636
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:11,875
Scott: With chili, it's like, you're not really putting too much water going on there.

637
00:41:11,895 --> 00:41:13,520
Scott: You're definitely not making a roux with butter.

638
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,018
Scott: No, no, no, no.

639
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,423
Scott: No, no, no, no, no, right?

640
00:41:16,463 --> 00:41:23,458
Scott: You're going with something tomato based maybe or, you know, some kind of, you know, maybe like some kind of stock or something, right?

641
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,684
Rym: Recently, that's made my chili way better.

642
00:41:25,724 --> 00:41:31,160
Rym: Like recently, like in the past five or six years that when I was younger, I didn't understand it's made my chili so much better.

643
00:41:31,762 --> 00:41:35,160
Rym: I realized you don't add the tomato until way late in the process.

644
00:41:35,933 --> 00:41:36,140
Rym: Oh, yeah.

645
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:40,472
Rym: The acid in the tomato kind of fucks it up and makes it harder to like make the meats.

646
00:41:40,592 --> 00:41:43,380
Rym: Like it causes all these chemistry problems in the chili.

647
00:41:45,061 --> 00:41:50,200
Rym: The other thing I learned to do better was instead of cooking the garlic, because I like to put a ton of garlic in.

648
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:58,640
Rym: Instead of cooking it separately, what I do is after I've made the fond and I've got all the vegetables, I make a little hole in the middle of the fond and I put some oil in the middle of that hole.

649
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,913
Rym: And I put all the garlic there and cook it by itself in the middle of the hole for like two minutes.

650
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:04,940
Rym: Then I mix it all together and then I deglaze.

651
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:06,461
Scott: Oh, you could do that.

652
00:42:06,481 --> 00:42:12,654
Scott: It really depends on if you're looking to keep the garlic in there.

653
00:42:12,715 --> 00:42:15,260
Scott: It's like you're maybe getting little niblets of garlic.

654
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,980
Rym: Or do you want it to be a paste that just causes garlic flavor?

655
00:42:18,801 --> 00:42:19,782
Scott: You could do that too.

656
00:42:20,383 --> 00:42:30,040
Scott: Or you could just take a whole head of garlic, right, chop it in half down the middle, toss it in, skins and all, right, and then you just got to get it out.

657
00:42:30,586 --> 00:42:30,654
Scott: Yup.

658
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:31,789
Scott: Before you serve it.

659
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:32,738
Scott: And that'll really...

660
00:42:33,041 --> 00:42:34,140
Rym: Use it like you use a bay leaf.

661
00:42:34,841 --> 00:42:35,001
Scott: Right.

662
00:42:35,022 --> 00:42:38,300
Scott: You'll get a fucking ton of garlic flavor into that, you know, whatever you want.

663
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:43,417
Rym: Though I'll admit I've found that if I want that kind of chili, using a bunch of granulated garlic has the exact same effect.

664
00:42:43,457 --> 00:42:44,340
Rym: You can't taste the difference.

665
00:42:44,881 --> 00:42:45,181
Scott: Yeah.

666
00:42:45,282 --> 00:42:49,674
Scott: But I'm saying like that's a, you know, usually I think the put the whole head of garlic in.

667
00:42:49,714 --> 00:42:51,498
Scott: You could do it with the chili.

668
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,040
Scott: It'll be good.

669
00:42:52,223 --> 00:42:52,317
Scott: Yeah.

670
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,645
Scott: But I think, you know, usually you're not.

671
00:42:55,247 --> 00:42:58,014
Scott: you're not pouring a chili through like a strainer, right?

672
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,260
Scott: The way you would say making like a chicken soup.

673
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:00,381
Rym: Yeah.

674
00:43:00,401 --> 00:43:01,569
Rym: You don't want to have to fish it all out.

675
00:43:01,589 --> 00:43:03,060
Rym: I've done that a couple times in my life.

676
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:04,326
Scott: But you could, you know, but you can.

677
00:43:04,366 --> 00:43:06,760
Scott: You can put a little string on it and then you can get out.

678
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:13,400
Rym: But for those of you who might not know a lot about like better cooking techniques, the fond, what we're talking about there.

679
00:43:13,601 --> 00:43:18,940
Rym: So imagine you have a bunch of celery or onions or stuff in the pot and you're cooking a whole bunch like over kind of high heat.

680
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:23,180
Rym: This brown crust has formed inside of your entire pot now, like everywhere.

681
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:25,240
Scott: Assuming you don't have some nonstick.

682
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:25,902
Scott: Yeah.

683
00:43:26,203 --> 00:43:30,100
Rym: I don't think you can make a particularly good chili in a nonstick pan.

684
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:31,380
Scott: I don't think you could either.

685
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:32,343
Rym: Because you need that fond.

686
00:43:32,383 --> 00:43:33,327
Rym: The fond will form.

687
00:43:33,788 --> 00:43:36,960
Rym: Normally, like when I was younger, I always thought that was me fucking up and like cooking too hot.

688
00:43:37,061 --> 00:43:38,740
Rym: But then I learned the secret of deglazing.

689
00:43:39,202 --> 00:43:42,233
Scott: Right, so it's like the Maillard reaction happens.

690
00:43:42,314 --> 00:43:43,980
Scott: Like you put an onion in a pan, right?

691
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:44,380
Scott: Yep.

692
00:43:44,401 --> 00:43:47,120
Scott: The onion starts to brown because of the Maillard reaction, right?

693
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:48,648
Rym: That brown is not bad.

694
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:50,100
Rym: That is pure flavor country.

695
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,644
Scott: That is the delicious part.

696
00:43:51,744 --> 00:43:56,080
Scott: But some of that brown will just like come off the onion and be stuck to the pan.

697
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,846
Scott: So it's like, OK, I got this piece of onion.

698
00:43:58,327 --> 00:44:00,073
Scott: It's grilled and heated nicely.

699
00:44:00,153 --> 00:44:02,140
Scott: So it's got, you know, browning and it tastes great.

700
00:44:02,622 --> 00:44:04,050
Scott: But some of the browning fell off.

701
00:44:04,633 --> 00:44:05,880
Scott: It's on the bottom of my pan.

702
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:06,342
Rym: Yep.

703
00:44:06,604 --> 00:44:08,239
Scott: You got to scrape that shit up.

704
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,324
Rym: And scraping it is real hard.

705
00:44:10,384 --> 00:44:11,667
Rym: That's why you deglaze.

706
00:44:11,787 --> 00:44:18,000
Rym: Use something like alcohol and you put a little bit of it in and it'll basically just melt all the fond into your food.

707
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:19,061
Scott: Right.

708
00:44:19,081 --> 00:44:22,335
Scott: So, for example, a lot of, and this isn't just chili, a lot of food cooking.

709
00:44:22,476 --> 00:44:23,380
Scott: this happens in, right?

710
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:23,661
Scott: Yep.

711
00:44:23,681 --> 00:44:24,828
Rym: Deglazing, like hook that up.

712
00:44:24,869 --> 00:44:26,660
Rym: And there's whole sets of instructions and techniques.

713
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:32,336
Scott: A lot of times, you know, like I'll like take some chicken on the skinless thighs, right?

714
00:44:32,376 --> 00:44:33,239
Scott: With some olive oil.

715
00:44:33,499 --> 00:44:33,700
Scott: Right.

716
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:35,304
Scott: They brown up nicely.

717
00:44:35,324 --> 00:44:40,600
Scott: And then it's like, OK, let's throw in all this other stuff and a splash of cooking wine.

718
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:40,981
Rym: Yep.

719
00:44:41,483 --> 00:44:46,120
Rym: Or some vinegar or sherry or brandy works really well.

720
00:44:46,741 --> 00:44:46,983
Scott: Yeah.

721
00:44:47,103 --> 00:44:49,859
Scott: Or even sometimes, depending on what you got, water can do it too.

722
00:44:49,959 --> 00:44:50,120
Scott: Right.

723
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:54,699
Scott: And suddenly all that stuff that was on the bottom of the pan comes right up and absorbs in.

724
00:44:55,621 --> 00:44:55,741
Scott: Right.

725
00:44:55,781 --> 00:44:56,302
Scott: And there you go.

726
00:44:56,362 --> 00:45:04,380
Scott: So you can even, for example, like say brown some chicken, take the chicken out of the, your chicken's done now, take it out and then make a sauce.

727
00:45:04,981 --> 00:45:08,780
Scott: And, you know, while you're making the sauce, all the stuff gets incorporated into the sauce.

728
00:45:09,041 --> 00:45:09,325
Rym: Yeah.

729
00:45:09,386 --> 00:45:10,240
Rym: I've done that a few times.

730
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:15,520
Scott: And then you would pour that sauce over the chicken out of the pan and your pan should look clean, but you still need to clean it.

731
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:29,980
Rym: For my basic chili, I usually use like a brown ale or a red ale, like a beer, and I'll basically pour half a can of beer into the fond and use that to deglaze because that adds a really nice flavor and all the alcohol obviously evaporates.

732
00:45:32,781 --> 00:45:41,658
Scott: Another thing you can do, right, is like a lot of people, I think, when they make chili, right, they're like, you know, you got to worry about the actual chilies, right?

733
00:45:42,018 --> 00:45:42,840
Scott: Where the name comes from.

734
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:51,560
Rym: So I just use chili powder, but, or in the state after I get the onions and the celery down, then I'll do that again with a whole bunch of peppers that I've chopped up.

735
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:52,240
Scott: Right.

736
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:58,088
Scott: But I think the real pro technique is to get dried chilies, right?

737
00:45:58,148 --> 00:46:06,980
Scott: Because the dried chilies, if you're not growing, if you're not growing your own, if you're looking at dried chilies, there are so many more available varieties.

738
00:46:07,281 --> 00:46:08,062
Rym: Yep.

739
00:46:08,163 --> 00:46:10,047
Scott: Especially if you live in like a city, right?

740
00:46:10,087 --> 00:46:15,200
Scott: Like I could go to the Mexican grocery and get a shit ton of different chilies, all crazy kinds, but they're all dried.

741
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:15,660
Scott: Yep.

742
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:15,841
Scott: Right?

743
00:46:16,562 --> 00:46:19,909
Scott: So you can rehydrate them, which is totally easy to do, right?

744
00:46:20,771 --> 00:46:25,240
Scott: You can get fresh chilies and like roast them down a little bit on a sheet pan in the oven.

745
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:25,741
Scott: Yep.

746
00:46:25,881 --> 00:46:26,081
Scott: Right?

747
00:46:26,182 --> 00:46:33,260
Rym: Especially, don't use poblanos in particular, roast them first because they will not break down fast enough if you cook them in the pot by themselves, the skins thick.

748
00:46:33,941 --> 00:46:36,700
Scott: The other thing, well, yeah, well, you roast them and you could take the skins off.

749
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:37,360
Rym: Yep.

750
00:46:37,441 --> 00:46:37,822
Rym: Exactly.

751
00:46:37,842 --> 00:46:39,248
Rym: There's a whole technique about that.

752
00:46:39,389 --> 00:46:40,071
Rym: It's like, look it up.

753
00:46:40,111 --> 00:46:42,200
Rym: It's a crazy technique with plastic bags, but it works.

754
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:42,964
Scott: I don't know.

755
00:46:43,004 --> 00:46:44,139
Scott: You don't always need a plastic bag.

756
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,493
Rym: The plastic bag just works so well.

757
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:47,700
Rym: It's so easy once you learn it.

758
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,180
Scott: You cook things to get the skins to peel off.

759
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:52,047
Rym: Yeah, but it depends on the pepper too.

760
00:46:52,087 --> 00:46:53,955
Rym: Like a lot of the peppers I use, you don't need to do this.

761
00:46:53,995 --> 00:46:55,260
Rym: You can just cook the whole pepper chopped up.

762
00:46:55,660 --> 00:47:01,160
Scott: But the other thing you can do is you can take those, right, and throw them in if you've got a blender or a food processor.

763
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:01,781
Rym: Yep.

764
00:47:01,981 --> 00:47:02,262
Rym: Right?

765
00:47:02,662 --> 00:47:13,200
Scott: So you get all your actual, you know, chilies, right, blend it up real good that way, and then they go in with all your meats into your stew pot.

766
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:13,701
Rym: Yep.

767
00:47:13,721 --> 00:47:19,000
Scott: So after that, after you get the meat- If you just throw a bunch of chilies in a pot, that's not going to work out as well.

768
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:20,182
Rym: So I have to get the meat in.

769
00:47:20,202 --> 00:47:22,769
Rym: I let it cook for like an hour, maybe longer.

770
00:47:22,869 --> 00:47:25,195
Rym: Like, chili just gets better the longer you let it cook.

771
00:47:25,275 --> 00:47:27,100
Rym: Like, that's just, that's the magic of chili.

772
00:47:27,641 --> 00:47:28,965
Scott: It depends on certain things, right?

773
00:47:29,005 --> 00:47:34,780
Scott: So if, you know, you've, you know, you might want to like, you know, say you're going real fancy, you want to do more like a barbecue chili.

774
00:47:35,801 --> 00:47:35,981
Scott: Right?

775
00:47:36,001 --> 00:47:44,080
Scott: So you can use that long chili cooking time as like a slow cooking for the meat to get it to be, you know, very barbecue tender, fall apart.

776
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:44,860
Scott: Right?

777
00:47:44,881 --> 00:47:46,264
Scott: Like a pulled pork situation.

778
00:47:46,885 --> 00:47:53,060
Scott: But maybe if you've, you know, got like a ground beef and you browned it already, you don't need as long a cook time there.

779
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:53,942
Scott: Right.

780
00:47:54,343 --> 00:48:01,580
Rym: But after all that cooking, then is when I add the tomato and if there's beans or tofu or anything, I put all that stuff in.

781
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:03,046
Rym: Like, so it's cooked for an hour.

782
00:48:03,127 --> 00:48:05,760
Rym: Then I put all the tomato and everything in for like 10 more minutes of cooking.

783
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:08,954
Scott: Because the thing about eating the chili, right?

784
00:48:08,994 --> 00:48:09,800
Scott: The most important part.

785
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:10,101
Scott: Yep.

786
00:48:10,201 --> 00:48:10,402
Scott: Right.

787
00:48:10,724 --> 00:48:12,753
Scott: Is you could just put it in a bowl and eat it with a spoon.

788
00:48:12,994 --> 00:48:14,280
Scott: Isn't that, that's perfectly acceptable.

789
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,953
Rym: My go-to is put it over rice or have croutons on top.

790
00:48:18,254 --> 00:48:19,520
Rym: Those are my two main ways.

791
00:48:19,981 --> 00:48:26,340
Scott: I feel like you have to add some kind of bread, rice, grain thing.

792
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:28,290
Rym: It just makes it a complete meal.

793
00:48:28,391 --> 00:48:29,560
Rym: It tastes, it feels right.

794
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:37,536
Scott: But I never want that grain to be a, uh, if the chili is next to the grain, right?

795
00:48:37,917 --> 00:48:39,340
Scott: Then the grain could be special.

796
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:42,831
Scott: So for example, I could have a bowl of chili with a garlic bread next to it.

797
00:48:42,952 --> 00:48:45,420
Scott: I could have a bowl of chili with a cornbread next to it.

798
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:48,320
Rym: But if it's chili in a bread bowl, that's just gotta be some plain ass bread.

799
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:48,962
Rym: That's right.

800
00:48:49,062 --> 00:49:06,060
Scott: If the chili is touching the bread or the rice or the grain, right, in any way, top or bottom, side, then that bread has to be plain as hell because it is just a bread vehicle, a wheat train, right, with meat passengers.

801
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:12,420
Rym: Chili in a bread bowl is like literally like one of my top 10 favorite foods on earth.

802
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:17,700
Scott: It is an extremely convenient way to eat chili because you don't have to think about the bread part or the bowl part.

803
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:22,534
Rym: Every time I ski, ski resorts are famous for having fucking garbage food.

804
00:49:23,055 --> 00:49:24,720
Rym: Even fancy ski resorts, the food is just garbage.

805
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:27,780
Scott: Oh, but they're also famous for having warm food because people are fucking cold.

806
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:32,900
Rym: Yup, but every ski resort, even the shittiest one, has fantastic chili.

807
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:37,940
Scott: Yeah, even someone who's not a great chef can make a chili.

808
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:38,400
Scott: Yup.

809
00:49:38,862 --> 00:49:50,964
Rym: My dad was a fireman and part of the reason I was so obsessed with chili is because we ate chili a lot because firemen in firehouses, like they'll go on rotation for like a week at a time, they all take turns cooking because they're living in the firehouse, they make chili like 80%

810
00:49:50,964 --> 00:49:51,406
Scott: of the time.

811
00:49:51,426 --> 00:49:53,777
Scott: Chili is like the stereotypical fireman, right?

812
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:57,332
Rym: Like firehouse chili is a thing, like that's a kind of chili.

813
00:49:58,216 --> 00:49:59,260
Rym: Put some cayenne pepper in it.

814
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:02,820
Scott: And they'll even say things like, you know, five alarm chili, right?

815
00:50:03,521 --> 00:50:03,682
Scott: Yup.

816
00:50:03,922 --> 00:50:08,700
Scott: Or, you know, I can't think of a single firehouse on earth that doesn't have their own chili cook-off.

817
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:09,967
Rym: Oh, 100% and their own chili recipe.

818
00:50:09,987 --> 00:50:12,180
Scott: I've never heard of one, at least in the United States.

819
00:50:12,441 --> 00:50:22,800
Rym: And because I ended up, because my dad was a lieutenant and he ended up being like the deputy chief, so as a kid and growing up, I met a lot of like, I went to a lot of different like firehouses over the course of my life.

820
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:29,260
Rym: And the one thing I remember is that every one of them had the one guy who made the chili for that firehouse because he was the best.

821
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:31,413
Rym: Like everyone had like one guy.

822
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:35,820
Scott: That's the guy who's entering the competition at the end of the year against the other firehouses.

823
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:40,880
Rym: My memory may be a little faulty, but I'm pretty sure 100% of the chili guys had full mustaches.

824
00:50:41,583 --> 00:50:41,823
Scott: Oh yeah.

825
00:50:41,984 --> 00:50:43,088
Scott: I mean, you can't make a chili.

826
00:50:43,148 --> 00:50:46,260
Scott: You gotta grow the mustache first before you can make the chili or else it'll turn out like shit.

827
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:46,621
Scott: Yup.

828
00:50:46,742 --> 00:50:48,594
Rym: My chili got worse when I shaved off the mustache.

829
00:50:48,634 --> 00:50:49,560
Rym: That's one problem.

830
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:50,600
Rym: That's right.

831
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:56,080
Rym: The other important component of eating the chili, not always, but for most chilis, I want to have a cold thing.

832
00:50:56,320 --> 00:51:00,859
Rym: Either a sour cream or a cheese to mix into it.

833
00:51:01,921 --> 00:51:07,899
Rym: Well, okay, so mixing in I'm not too big on because that can dilute- Well, you put it on top and I only mix it in right as I'm eating it.

834
00:51:08,581 --> 00:51:08,701
Scott: Right.

835
00:51:08,741 --> 00:51:10,505
Scott: That can dilute the power of the chili.

836
00:51:10,565 --> 00:51:18,540
Scott: If I do a sour cream, then what I want to do is I want to sort of like, you know, get a little chili on a bread and then put a sour cream and then eat that.

837
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:18,942
Rym: Oh yeah.

838
00:51:19,023 --> 00:51:21,800
Rym: I like to put a blob of sour cream on top of the chili bowl.

839
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:29,260
Scott: I'll even do that just like in the house, not even chili, but like if I'm eating chips and salsa, I'll just get sour cream and I'll dip the chip in the salsa and then in the sour cream.

840
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:29,785
Scott: Yup.

841
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:35,836
Scott: But I think if you're doing cheese or any kind of dairy, I just get the bowl of chili ready.

842
00:51:35,856 --> 00:51:37,040
Scott: So if we're doing the bread bowl, right?

843
00:51:37,181 --> 00:51:39,960
Rym: If you sprinkle it on the top, make a layer like a French onion soup.

844
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:41,603
Scott: Top, top sprinkle, right?

845
00:51:41,623 --> 00:51:46,556
Scott: I get the cheese grater, I get the block of cheese and then I go right on top of the bowl, right?

846
00:51:46,616 --> 00:51:47,399
Scott: No mixing, right?

847
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:49,650
Rym: And I don't use a fancy cheese.

848
00:51:49,771 --> 00:51:50,880
Rym: I use like Monterey Jack or cheddar.

849
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:51,562
Scott: Oh, no, no, no.

850
00:51:51,642 --> 00:51:56,580
Scott: I use the regular old just cheddar cheese, you know, rectangle from the grocery store.

851
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:57,840
Rym: Monterey Jack is a good choice.

852
00:51:58,162 --> 00:51:59,639
Scott: It could be a sharp one, but you know.

853
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:10,540
Rym: But if your chili is particularly powerful or good on its own and you don't want to even like compromise at all, you just want that cheese like texture and flavor, Monterey Jack is not a bad way to go on a chili.

854
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:10,941
Rym: No, no.

855
00:52:11,303 --> 00:52:14,320
Scott: I think, you know, nothing fancier than Laughing Cow should be going on.

856
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:14,570
Scott: No.

857
00:52:16,663 --> 00:52:20,920
Scott: And I think most of the Laughing Cow varieties aren't even chili appropriate, I don't think.

858
00:52:21,641 --> 00:52:32,960
Rym: So in terms of the other bits of chili, and I think we've gone on for long enough about chili, when I cook it, I usually use a beef broth instead of water because that just makes the chili way more flavorful without me having to fuck with it.

859
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:35,121
Rym: Like that works pretty well.

860
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:46,580
Rym: Sometimes I'll make, but if I don't want to mess up the flavor, I'll use a vegetarian broth or I'll just use water and add enough salt to the water to make it as salty as broth, but to not add any flavor.

861
00:52:47,261 --> 00:52:48,685
Scott: Yeah, I'm still not an expert on this.

862
00:52:48,746 --> 00:52:55,240
Rym: I know that stock comes from like, you know, bones and broth comes from- We made some the other night, I can show you how to make broth.

863
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,024
Scott: No, no, no, but I'm saying is like, you know, it's like.

864
00:52:58,044 --> 00:53:00,369
Scott: I know this stock versus broth, right?

865
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:04,117
Scott: But it's like when would you, you know, when do you use one and when the other?

866
00:53:04,178 --> 00:53:05,260
Scott: Or is stock just better?

867
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,947
Rym: You know what, in terms of chili, I found it doesn't matter.

868
00:53:08,128 --> 00:53:11,939
Rym: I've used all different kinds of stocks and broths and like even my saltwater technique.

869
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:24,658
Scott: Because I get the feeling that like, you know, when I hear like chefs, I've never heard them say it directly, but I get the feeling whenever I watch cooking programs that stock is just better than broth, fuck broth, right?

870
00:53:24,678 --> 00:53:25,760
Scott: That's like the vibe I get.

871
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:26,803
Rym: All right, I just googled it.

872
00:53:26,843 --> 00:53:28,347
Rym: What's the difference between stock and broth?

873
00:53:28,548 --> 00:53:32,880
Rym: The terms stock and broth are used interchangeably and you can substitute one for the other within recipes.

874
00:53:33,644 --> 00:53:34,018
Scott: Uh-huh.

875
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,679
Rym: There's slight difference in their preparation, like that's it.

876
00:53:37,521 --> 00:53:45,975
Scott: All right, well, anyway, if you go to the grocery store, you'll definitely see the same brand selling in a carton, right?

877
00:53:46,235 --> 00:53:49,080
Scott: Stock and broth of the same animal and they're two different products.

878
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:54,900
Rym: But seriously, like you can get away with just water and salt if you put enough good ingredients in there.

879
00:53:55,400 --> 00:54:03,900
Rym: And in terms of tomato, I either use fresh crushed tomatoes, like from a, not fresh, but like from a can, but like crushed or diced or honestly.

880
00:54:04,861 --> 00:54:10,080
Scott: If you got tomato, can is the way to go unless it's that one moment of the year where tomato is in season.

881
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:10,882
Rym: Yup.

882
00:54:10,902 --> 00:54:14,155
Rym: Tomato paste, however, you can't tell the difference.

883
00:54:14,175 --> 00:54:15,360
Rym: Tomato paste, like if you're chili.

884
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:16,620
Scott: Tomato paste is from a can.

885
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:23,655
Rym: Yeah, but tomato paste is fine compared to like a big thing of diced tomatoes and way easier to work with and you can store it longer.

886
00:54:23,796 --> 00:54:25,620
Rym: and tomato paste is just like magic.

887
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:33,320
Rym: If a chili doesn't feel quite right, or you kind of messed up the flavor profile, more tomato will just make it taste more like generic chili and save you.

888
00:54:33,662 --> 00:54:35,760
Rym: Tomato paste is like tomato concentrate.

889
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,827
Scott: Yeah, I mean tomato paste is literally tomato concentrate.

890
00:54:38,907 --> 00:54:42,880
Scott: If you need tomato sauce, just take tomato paste and water and look, you got tomato sauce.

891
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:43,175
Scott: Yup.

892
00:54:43,603 --> 00:54:44,279
Scott: That's how it works.

893
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:44,616
Scott: Yup.

894
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:45,300
Scott: That's the point.

895
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:52,194
Rym: In terms of the spices, I tend to, the one thing I really don't deviate from is I tend to mostly just use chili powder.

896
00:54:52,595 --> 00:54:53,857
Rym: A shit ton of cumin.

897
00:54:53,877 --> 00:54:55,180
Rym: I love cumin.

898
00:54:55,841 --> 00:54:56,122
Scott: Oh yeah.

899
00:54:56,403 --> 00:55:02,957
Scott: We got, Amanda was making a chili today and she's like, "I bought this giant cumin, but look, it's running out.

900
00:55:03,017 --> 00:55:03,678
Scott: I make so much

901
00:55:03,698 --> 00:55:03,919
Scott: chili.".

902
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:10,157
Scott: It's like, we never buy big things because there's not a lot of people and we don't eat that much food in New York.

903
00:55:10,177 --> 00:55:11,360
Scott: You don't have a lot of storage space.

904
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:14,420
Scott: We don't like to buy big, you know, we like to buy small amounts.

905
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:15,959
Rym: Only now am I buying big things.

906
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:18,930
Scott: Right, but she's like, "I bought this big cumin,".

907
00:55:19,131 --> 00:55:20,638
Scott: and it's like, "I never want to buy a big

908
00:55:20,698 --> 00:55:20,939
Scott: thing.".

909
00:55:21,283 --> 00:55:21,916
Rym: Cumin's so good.

910
00:55:22,361 --> 00:55:25,557
Rym: Like, however much cumin you think you should use in a chili, just use three times as much.

911
00:55:25,577 --> 00:55:26,140
Rym: It'll be fine.

912
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:26,800
Scott: Right.

913
00:55:26,821 --> 00:55:30,740
Scott: We use so much cumin in the chili that the big one was the right purchase.

914
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:31,180
Rym: Yup.

915
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:38,598
Rym: And then I either use smoked paprika or cayenne pepper, depending on what kind of kick I want to give it and all the rest of the flavor.

916
00:55:38,618 --> 00:55:39,560
Rym: I just want it to come from my ingredients.

917
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:40,479
Scott: Yeah, they're pretty similar-ish.

918
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:41,020
Rym: Yeah.

919
00:55:41,804 --> 00:55:44,920
Rym: Mostly depends if I want it smokier versus, like, spicier.

920
00:55:45,721 --> 00:55:51,332
Scott: Yeah, I think that's the thing is you got to mix, you know, the great chilies, you're mixing together different chili flavors.

921
00:55:51,352 --> 00:55:55,060
Scott: You get, like, a fruity pepper and a spicy pepper and a smoky pepper.

922
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:58,260
Scott: Get all three or balance them in some way.

923
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:02,560
Rym: Or don't balance them and lean in heavily to one and make a very, like, specific kind of chili.

924
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:09,017
Rym: Habaneros are real good for flavor, but do not try to make a chili with just habaneros.

925
00:56:09,037 --> 00:56:09,760
Rym: You'll be in for a bad time.

926
00:56:10,041 --> 00:56:15,200
Scott: Whichever one of the peppers you lean into, the rest of the chili has to sort of contrast.

927
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:16,421
Scott: Right?

928
00:56:16,561 --> 00:56:23,160
Scott: So if you got, say, you know, if you go in, like, the extra, like, on fire spice, like a real tangy kind of spice.

929
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:25,219
Rym: Don't also go heavy on chipotle in that.

930
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:26,161
Scott: Right.

931
00:56:26,221 --> 00:56:31,620
Scott: Then you might want to come back on it and go maybe more, you know, with some dairy on that, right?

932
00:56:31,861 --> 00:56:36,216
Scott: Or, you know, maybe a sweeter tomato to go on the other side.

933
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:45,600
Rym: Like, one thing I really like to make is instead of using a lot of chili powder, I'll get, like, three or four pounds of rainbow peppers, just, like, random sweet peppers.

934
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:51,120
Rym: Chop them all up and I'll braise those down just like I would with the celery and the onion.

935
00:56:51,801 --> 00:56:54,814
Rym: And then for a kick, I just add a bunch of cayenne pepper.

936
00:56:55,176 --> 00:56:56,020
Rym: That works real well.

937
00:56:56,762 --> 00:56:58,080
Rym: And it makes, like, almost a sweet chili.

938
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:00,911
Rym: So you get this contrasting sweet and spicy.

939
00:57:02,641 --> 00:57:03,280
Rym: Last thing about chili?

940
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:05,619
Scott: Yeah, because we got to end the show.

941
00:57:05,762 --> 00:57:06,900
Rym: Yep, and I'm getting hungry, so.

942
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:08,719
Scott: Is that, oh, well, you've been talking about chili.

943
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:09,872
Rym: I know, I'm getting real hungry.

944
00:57:09,892 --> 00:57:10,480
Rym: I want some chili.

945
00:57:11,202 --> 00:57:11,860
Scott: I ate food already.

946
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:13,579
Rym: I think we're going to get a Baroness burger tonight.

947
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:14,720
Scott: Ooh, exciting.

948
00:57:15,621 --> 00:57:19,860
Scott: Is that, unlike a lot of other foods, chili is good all times.

949
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:22,314
Rym: Oh, yeah, breakfast chili, Bob, chili omelet.

950
00:57:24,641 --> 00:57:27,800
Scott: Breakfast chili, lunch chili, dinner chili, all appropriate.

951
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:29,859
Rym: Late night snack chili, you'll get heartburn, but fuck it.

952
00:57:30,681 --> 00:57:30,902
Scott: Right.

953
00:57:31,145 --> 00:57:32,940
Scott: And then, not only that, but all seasons.

954
00:57:33,182 --> 00:57:35,500
Scott: Summer chili, winter chili, right?

955
00:57:35,661 --> 00:57:36,026
Scott: I'm cold.

956
00:57:36,127 --> 00:57:36,979
Scott: I want to eat warm chili.

957
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:37,845
Scott: It's summer.

958
00:57:37,946 --> 00:57:39,540
Scott: Let's go outside and have a chili cook-off.

959
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:41,860
Scott: And also, I have chili at the barbecue.

960
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:42,438
Scott: Made too much?

961
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:43,627
Scott: I'll have a chili dog.

962
00:57:43,667 --> 00:57:45,400
Scott: I'll dip my hot dogs in the chili in the summer.

963
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:47,080
Rym: But in the middle of winter, cooking some chili?

964
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:49,080
Rym: All right, now there's a bunch of humidity in the apartment.

965
00:57:49,441 --> 00:57:50,279
Rym: Everything smells good.

966
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:51,919
Scott: Oh, it's dry because the heat's on.

967
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:52,341
Rym: Yep.

968
00:57:53,230 --> 00:57:54,320
Rym: But you make humidity.

969
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:55,221
Scott: Right.

970
00:57:55,281 --> 00:58:03,820
Scott: There's never a time where it's not chili season, because everything you're using in the chili is meat, which it doesn't have a season, right?

971
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:11,640
Scott: And canned vegetables and dried peppers and all these, you know, beans from a can, right?

972
00:58:11,741 --> 00:58:13,420
Scott: All the ingredients going in the chili.

973
00:58:14,121 --> 00:58:16,580
Scott: So, almost none of them are fresh and seasonal.

974
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:19,380
Scott: All dried, preserved meats.

975
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:21,680
Rym: Like onions and celery in particular.

976
00:58:21,961 --> 00:58:23,920
Rym: It does not have to be good onions or good celery.

977
00:58:24,261 --> 00:58:27,300
Rym: Usually, when I use celery, it's because we have too much celery.

978
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:31,360
Scott: You can always get a good onion anytime if you live in a place that has food.

979
00:58:31,467 --> 00:58:31,597
Scott: Yep.

980
00:58:33,082 --> 00:58:35,340
Scott: So, that's one of the greatest things about chili.

981
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:40,740
Scott: That even other, better, not to say chili is the greatest food on Earth, you know, it's a great food for sure.

982
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:40,941
Rym: Yep.

983
00:58:41,042 --> 00:58:41,951
Rym: It's not my number one.

984
00:58:41,991 --> 00:58:42,859
Rym: It's just in my top ten.

985
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:43,260
Scott: No.

986
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:48,720
Scott: But it's like other, greater foods are often seasonal in some way or time-based, right?

987
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:51,580
Scott: I wouldn't eat the delicious steak dinner for breakfast.

988
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:52,528
Rym: Yep.

989
00:58:52,670 --> 00:58:53,340
Rym: Don't steak and eggs.

990
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,520
Scott: But you don't- You could have a country fried steak for breakfast.

991
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:55,801
Rym: Yep.

992
00:58:55,821 --> 00:58:58,920
Rym: But if you make steak and eggs, you're not making a filet mignon steak and eggs.

993
00:58:59,540 --> 00:58:59,961
Scott: Exactly.

994
00:59:00,222 --> 00:59:05,420
Scott: But chili is appropriate at per every meal, in every season, in every time, in every place.

995
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:09,988
Rym: The other main property of chili, the last one that's real important that you didn't touch on- The real last one?

996
00:59:10,009 --> 00:59:10,720
Scott: I already did the last one.

997
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:11,679
Rym: There is a last, last one.

998
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:16,860
Rym: You're coming over the last, last- It's impossible to make too much because you can just freeze it and thaw it.

999
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:19,800
Rym: Frozen chili, recooked, just tastes better.

1000
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:20,721
Scott: Yeah.

1001
00:59:20,882 --> 00:59:22,694
Scott: I mean, you know, it's made of preserved stuff.

1002
00:59:22,754 --> 00:59:23,580
Scott: Just preserve it again.

1003
00:59:23,881 --> 00:59:33,460
Rym: And as long as you're careful with the temperatures and, like, If you freeze chili that you made, thaw it and cook a bunch of it, don't finish it, you can just refreeze that shit and it's good again.

1004
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:34,423
Scott: Yeah.

1005
00:59:34,484 --> 00:59:35,599
Scott: No, it's not- What's wrong with it?

1006
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:35,960
Rym: Yeah.

1007
00:59:36,001 --> 00:59:41,820
Rym: The only problem you can have is if you don't do right food safety and let it sit out too long because you'll slowly increase the bacterial load.

1008
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:47,360
Scott: If you leave it in the fridge too long or you let it sit out too long, it's okay until you see something growing on it.

1009
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:47,643
Rym: Yep.

1010
00:59:47,928 --> 00:59:48,640
Rym: So here's the secret.

1011
00:59:49,101 --> 00:59:53,440
Rym: If you make a lot of chili and you want to freeze it or get into your fridge, don't just put it in the freezer.

1012
00:59:53,581 --> 00:59:57,240
Rym: It'll actually mess up the rest of your freezer or fridge because it's so hot.

1013
00:59:57,722 --> 01:00:01,200
Rym: And if you let it get cool to room temperature naturally, that usually works.

1014
01:00:01,462 --> 01:00:05,560
Scott: But it's not super safe unless- It'll be sitting in the danger zone for a long time.

1015
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:05,801
Rym: Yeah.

1016
01:00:05,821 --> 01:00:06,806
Rym: Way too long.

1017
01:00:06,926 --> 01:00:09,780
Rym: Meaning if you freeze it once that way, do not do that again.

1018
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:14,720
Scott: But- Usually just separate it into individual serving containers and freeze those.

1019
01:00:15,041 --> 01:00:25,260
Rym: Well separate it into individual serving containers, but then what I do is I seal those containers and I put them in a cold water bath to bring their temperature down rapidly before I put them in the fridge and then the freezer.

1020
01:00:27,562 --> 01:00:29,940
Rym: That really minimizes the time it's in the danger zone.

1021
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:34,581
Scott: Putting them in the containers is going to already cool them off a whole bunch because- Remember I

1022
01:00:34,621 --> 01:00:44,560
Rym: worked at that shitty restaurant at RIT, so one of the things I was actually responsible for was taking the chili and the hot saucy, the meaty hot sauce stuff that they had down there.

1023
01:00:44,981 --> 01:00:48,656
Rym: And doing the quick cool before we then staged it into the fridge and then the freezer.

1024
01:00:48,696 --> 01:00:49,640
Rym: That was literally my job.

1025
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:58,315
Scott: Yeah, but I think that the individual containers is key because if you have a giant bucket of chili in the fridge or the freezer- What, are you going to chisel out and split that up?

1026
01:00:58,335 --> 01:00:58,920
Rym: That's not going to fly.

1027
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:01,448
Scott: Right, you've got to heat that whole thing up when you want chili again.

1028
01:01:01,489 --> 01:01:04,620
Scott: If you've got individual containers, you can just pop one out and chili anytime.

1029
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:05,221
Rym: Yeah.

1030
01:01:05,882 --> 01:01:07,868
Rym: My god, next week I'm going to make some more chili.

1031
01:01:08,048 --> 01:01:10,335
