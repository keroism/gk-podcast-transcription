1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,500
Rym: It's Monday November 23rd 2020.

2
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,968
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:16,008 --> 00:00:18,040
Rym: We are talking about displays.

4
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:20,568
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:29,710
Rym: So as you all know because I talk about it a lot I have two of the same smartphone and the one I had for a long time starting to wear out.

6
00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:31,787
Rym: so I started migrating everything to the new one.

7
00:00:31,807 --> 00:00:41,470
Rym: and the most annoying thing about migrating from any smartphone to any other smartphone is Resetting up all your two-factor nonsense on the new phone exactly.

8
00:00:41,952 --> 00:00:43,078
Scott: So just so people are.

9
00:00:43,178 --> 00:00:45,670
Scott: if you don't know we did do a show on two-factor authentication.

10
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:52,169
Scott: But the most common use the most common two-factor authentication method the one you're used to with Google authenticator app or whatever.

11
00:00:52,189 --> 00:00:58,050
Scott: it is TOTP And the way it works is it's a time-based one-time pad.

12
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:02,970
Scott: You have a private secret key a number that is in your phone and nowhere else, right?

13
00:01:03,371 --> 00:01:04,697
Scott: So it's effectively.

14
00:01:04,818 --> 00:01:11,966
Scott: it could be something, you know, someone could know the number But really it's a thing you have because it's written down in the phone's memory in a special place.

15
00:01:12,207 --> 00:01:25,970
Scott: if you have an iPhone at Least they have that secure enclave or whatever And then it's nowhere else in the world and there's no way to read it out Like there is no function that will get the app to read that number and tell it to anything else.

16
00:01:26,177 --> 00:01:27,694
Scott: Yeah So it's stuck there.

17
00:01:28,216 --> 00:01:36,730
Scott: and then using that secret number and the current time it Generates codes and no one else could generate those codes at you know.

18
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:41,683
Scott: So when you send those codes to the other computer They know what time it is because they're also a computer.

19
00:01:42,145 --> 00:01:47,730
Scott: and they say well They know mathematically that the only they don't know your private key.

20
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:48,814
Scott: They only know the public one.

21
00:01:49,537 --> 00:01:53,230
Scott: the public one can't be used to generate keys, but it can be used to verify keys.

22
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:58,050
Scott: So basically you tell them a number that you made using the private key and the time.

23
00:01:58,573 --> 00:02:05,683
Scott: They look at that number and they look at what time it is and they say aha Only someone who has the private key would be able to guess this exact number.

24
00:02:05,723 --> 00:02:07,108
Scott: It's a one in a million chance.

25
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:07,810
Scott: It's six digits.

26
00:02:09,531 --> 00:02:10,334
Scott: It's not eat right?

27
00:02:10,354 --> 00:02:11,760
Scott: You're not gonna get they're not gonna let.

28
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,390
Scott: you've got a million guesses six or thirty cells.

29
00:02:14,571 --> 00:02:16,960
Rym: It depends that there's different schemes on how many seconds.

30
00:02:17,301 --> 00:02:21,115
Scott: I forget how many seconds that if you can divide the time up You want it doesn't matter right?

31
00:02:21,155 --> 00:02:26,694
Scott: the point is you don't even if you somebody could guess a million times The perfect.

32
00:02:26,794 --> 00:02:29,161
Scott: the system that's having you log in like Google.

33
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,990
Scott: if someone tries to guess, you know more than ten codes.

34
00:02:32,091 --> 00:02:33,769
Scott: It's like yeah, you've had enough.

35
00:02:34,313 --> 00:02:39,619
Scott: It's like we're not gonna let you guess a million times Even if you could generate all million guesses that quickly.

36
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,943
Scott: so now some services.

37
00:02:40,963 --> 00:02:42,067
Scott: problem is right.

38
00:02:42,087 --> 00:02:42,950
Scott: you switch services.

39
00:02:43,414 --> 00:02:44,829
Scott: You have to get a new phone.

40
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:52,215
Scott: There's no way to read the private key out of phone a and put it into phone B. It's stuck there.

41
00:02:52,557 --> 00:02:55,129
Rym: because if you could do that that actually creates a problem.

42
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:57,978
Rym: now I noticed my Google auth app, which I deprecated like.

43
00:02:57,998 --> 00:03:01,389
Rym: I don't use it anymore, but I noticed it has like an export function.

44
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:03,333
Scott: now Mine doesn't?

45
00:03:03,896 --> 00:03:04,842
Rym: it appeared that I must be.

46
00:03:04,943 --> 00:03:05,788
Scott: it must be Android.

47
00:03:05,869 --> 00:03:08,950
Rym: only I'm actually restarting my phone to look at it again because I noticed it.

48
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:12,603
Rym: I wasn't sure what it did but it appeared that I would give you iOS.

49
00:03:12,723 --> 00:03:15,412
Scott: one does not have that only the only the Android.

50
00:03:15,453 --> 00:03:18,624
Rym: so I might have been able to actually migrate from one to the other.

51
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:21,816
Rym: but what annoys me is that Well-made services.

52
00:03:21,837 --> 00:03:29,975
Rym: I don't have many of these problems because they actually let you configure multiple TOTP authenticators for the same service.

53
00:03:30,015 --> 00:03:34,610
Rym: you could then give them names or even let you have multiple options like have a key or your thing.

54
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,420
Rym: Like you can set up stuff, but a lot of people.

55
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:41,960
Rym: you just don't want phone to be one of your options Yep, but a lot of services only lets you set up one.

56
00:03:42,301 --> 00:03:42,662
Rym: You can't.

57
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:43,565
Scott: even email isn't?

58
00:03:43,705 --> 00:03:45,370
Scott: email is a is an okay option.

59
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:49,150
Scott: It's better than phone, but it's still not great because email is still unencrypted.

60
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:53,927
Scott: So someone who's accessing email servers could see emails flying around see the codes in them and use them.

61
00:03:54,228 --> 00:03:55,557
Rym: Yep And that's a mess.

62
00:03:55,618 --> 00:03:56,709
Rym: anyway a worst option.

63
00:03:57,311 --> 00:03:58,034
Scott: So Yuba key.

64
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:08,029
Scott: I bought the original or one of the very close to the original you because I belonged I was living in beacon And at the time it wasn't actually that useful because not too many things supported it.

65
00:04:09,114 --> 00:04:21,209
Scott: One OAuth service that I used to log into one government account I used it for like WordPress and even though I stopped I my WordPress blogs are still up even though I haven't used them in forever.

66
00:04:22,154 --> 00:04:31,230
Scott: But I did like having extra security on them not because they were particularly Worth protecting but because WordPress is very highly attacked.

67
00:04:31,451 --> 00:04:35,730
Scott: Yeah, right, so I just wanted to put a little extra security on there.

68
00:04:36,031 --> 00:04:40,306
Scott: But yes, you know the Yuba keys that I had those days were not very useful.

69
00:04:40,326 --> 00:04:44,127
Scott: They didn't use TOTP They used a what's it called Fido or whatever, right?

70
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:50,793
Scott: Now what I know is I actually you're logging into and they could and they only worked on something that had USB port So not a phone.

71
00:04:50,953 --> 00:04:51,154
Scott: Yep.

72
00:04:51,395 --> 00:04:57,660
Rym: I set up a bunch of stuff with my Yuba key to control like Access to password vaults and things like.

73
00:04:57,701 --> 00:05:03,089
Rym: I did a lot with it back then like as much as I could But it wasn't like mainstream like I couldn't use it with Google easily, right?

74
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:08,967
Scott: So now Yuba key is a lot more mainstream but also so this is the current Yuba key.

75
00:05:08,987 --> 00:05:12,613
Scott: is the Yuba key NFC whatever?

76
00:05:12,673 --> 00:05:19,416
Scott: so not only does it USB, right but it also in addition to being USB I don't want to show the back of it.

77
00:05:19,436 --> 00:05:20,520
Scott: That's what the code is.

78
00:05:21,283 --> 00:05:22,890
Rym: Not that that would necessarily matter.

79
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:27,890
Scott: Someone could maybe request the same Yuba key from Yuba key if they had I don't know.

80
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:33,070
Scott: Anyway, the point is not only does it do all the things the old Yuba key did but also works with NFC.

81
00:05:33,231 --> 00:05:36,190
Scott: So you just hold your phone near it to get the code.

82
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,564
Rym: Now older Yuba keys already did that but in the old days.

83
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:41,170
Rym: that didn't work with iPhones.

84
00:05:41,311 --> 00:05:45,366
Rym: It only worked with Android for Apple reasons that were stupid and those reasons are all gone.

85
00:05:45,426 --> 00:05:46,149
Rym: Apple finally fixed it.

86
00:05:46,189 --> 00:05:49,663
Scott: now I think now the newest Apple devices it will work with.

87
00:05:49,823 --> 00:05:51,470
Scott: it works with iPhones going way back.

88
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:54,500
Scott: It worked with my iPhone 7 and my new iPhone 12.

89
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,306
Scott: It did not work with my iPad.

90
00:05:56,367 --> 00:05:57,370
Scott: That's a couple years old.

91
00:05:57,451 --> 00:06:04,010
Rym: I think only the newest iPads Will do it and older iPhones like iPhones 5 like 6 like it didn't work at all from what I remember.

92
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,889
Scott: Yeah, it didn't work then but that was like five years ago.

93
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,378
Rym: But the cool thing is iPhone 7.

94
00:06:07,378 --> 00:06:08,987
Scott: it worked fine and that's four years ago.

95
00:06:09,007 --> 00:06:09,530
Rym: Oh check this out.

96
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:13,630
Rym: So in the Google authenticator app in Android, there's an option to export accounts.

97
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:22,489
Rym: It'll create a QR code you scan it with a different Google authenticator It passes the private keys across and then the old authenticator stops working and the new one starts working.

98
00:06:23,757 --> 00:06:24,300
Scott: All right.

99
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,730
Scott: Well the iOS one doesn't have that.

100
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:32,859
Scott: So if you get access to someone's unlocked phone, open up their Google authenticator and steal their private keys Yeah, I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing.

101
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:35,289
Scott: So what the YubaKey does, right?

102
00:06:37,052 --> 00:06:39,673
Scott: That is so great Is that you can.

103
00:06:39,753 --> 00:06:41,017
Scott: it actually has storage in it.

104
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:52,468
Scott: and over NFC or I guess over USB maybe but over NFC You can actually put into the YubaKey up to 32 TOTP private keys.

105
00:06:53,254 --> 00:07:06,209
Scott: So now basically whenever I want to generate codes I hold my phone Near the YubaKey and it's then it generates a set of codes for all my apps And if I don't use the codes, then I have to hold my phone near the thing again.

106
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:12,410
Rym: But what that means, the phone is now just a display like if my phone breaks I can borrow any phone on earth.

107
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,402
Rym: That has the Yubico authenticator app, which is free.

108
00:07:15,703 --> 00:07:17,109
Rym: hold my key up to it get my code.

109
00:07:17,993 --> 00:07:35,630
Scott: Not only that I can take the YubaKey which is USB put it into my desktop computer Which is where it is And then I can open up the Yubico authenticator app on my computer and generate codes with a desktop Application and copy the codes from that application to my browser to use them.

110
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,903
Scott: I don't need my phone when I'm at my computer.

111
00:07:37,923 --> 00:07:39,817
Scott: if I left my phone in the other room I don't have to go get it.

112
00:07:40,119 --> 00:07:46,970
Rym: Yeah, even better I set up a bunch of sites support this now way more than used to using the key itself directly.

113
00:07:47,193 --> 00:07:50,709
Scott: Yes, exactly You can also.

114
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:52,755
Scott: What's it called?

115
00:07:53,057 --> 00:07:58,490
Scott: What I did is when I was setting up all the keys I actually bought two YubaKeys set it up on both at the same time.

116
00:07:58,974 --> 00:08:00,690
Scott: I set it up on both at the same time.

117
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,848
Scott: So if I lose one YubaKey, I have a backup that has all the codes in it.

118
00:08:04,631 --> 00:08:09,812
Rym: So I thought about doing that but it was kind of a pain with the timing and I gave up and I have one YubaKey With everything.

119
00:08:10,153 --> 00:08:12,420
Scott: but I just photographed every QR code twice.

120
00:08:12,601 --> 00:08:21,810
Rym: Yeah, I reset up every one of my Backup codes and those those are now secure in a place and I also took my my other YubaKey.

121
00:08:22,472 --> 00:08:27,145
Rym: I set that up as a key for things that allow multiple keys.

122
00:08:27,165 --> 00:08:28,650
Rym: that I called it my backup key.

123
00:08:29,493 --> 00:08:31,360
Scott: Yeah, I did that also if there was something like that.

124
00:08:32,023 --> 00:08:41,722
Scott: I just want to give a Sort of thumbs down To Instagram's two factor, right?

125
00:08:42,066 --> 00:08:44,454
Scott: Oh, so The Instagram cuz.

126
00:08:44,494 --> 00:08:46,862
Rym: I know that I noticed someone was futzing with it.

127
00:08:46,922 --> 00:08:54,669
Scott: I assumed it was you of course, it's me so the so if Instagram you can only mess with two factor.

128
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:58,538
Scott: you can Wherever you're logging into Instagram, it'll the two.

129
00:08:58,599 --> 00:08:59,782
Scott: logging in is just fine.

130
00:08:59,822 --> 00:09:00,725
Scott: It asks for codes.

131
00:09:00,905 --> 00:09:02,450
Scott: It asks her backup codes, whatever, right?

132
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:08,210
Scott: When if you want to set up two-factor authentication on Instagram, you have to disable it and re-enable it.

133
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,829
Rym: Okay, a lot of services are like that.

134
00:09:10,831 --> 00:09:15,190
Scott: That's fine there's a better way but whatever they'll only let you do it on your phone.

135
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,438
Scott: They won't let you do it on desktop.

136
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:20,179
Scott: If you try to do it on desktop, it says sorry You have to do it on your phone.

137
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:21,626
Scott: I do it on your hates.

138
00:09:21,927 --> 00:09:22,470
Rym: that trend.

139
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:25,410
Rym: There are so many things that don't work at all on desktop anymore.

140
00:09:26,011 --> 00:09:31,978
Scott: Yep, if you try to do it on your phone in the Instagram app what it will do when you try when you say You know set me up.

141
00:09:32,421 --> 00:09:33,830
Scott: It won't show you a QR code.

142
00:09:34,271 --> 00:09:34,732
Scott: It just won't.

143
00:09:35,253 --> 00:09:47,488
Scott: what it will do is it will look on your phone for the default authenticator app, whatever that happens to be and launch it and Insert the keys into it using the standard API for doing this.

144
00:09:48,733 --> 00:09:54,230
Scott: And I had like three apps even though and there's no way to like choose the default one necessarily.

145
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:58,609
Scott: So we're like opened up the Microsoft Authenticator app, which I wasn't using anymore and I was like no.

146
00:10:00,913 --> 00:10:02,988
Scott: So I had to delete the Microsoft Authenticator app.

147
00:10:04,412 --> 00:10:07,109
Scott: Get it to open the Google one to put the codes in there.

148
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:17,119
Scott: Right, if you want to use some other authenticator app besides the one it's gonna just launch on its own It won't show you a QR code to photograph.

149
00:10:17,319 --> 00:10:25,299
Scott: It will instead show you the literal private key to type in and It's like so to put it on.

150
00:10:25,319 --> 00:10:30,569
Scott: so for me to use the YubiKey with Instagram I would add a type in those like a whole big thing.

151
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:37,218
Scott: Right and it didn't tell me like which Encryption method it was using for that key.

152
00:10:37,861 --> 00:10:47,549
Scott: and I think if I choose the wrong and there's a lot of choices You know, they're not just straightforward So I tried to just I tried to type it in once and it didn't work.

153
00:10:48,132 --> 00:10:50,882
Scott: So I clearly made the wrong choice, which is the default.

154
00:10:50,902 --> 00:10:52,750
Scott: I made the default choice and that was wrong.

155
00:10:54,070 --> 00:11:00,590
Scott: So I could not put Instagram on to the YubiKey because their implementation is bad.

156
00:11:01,095 --> 00:11:03,312
Rym: That is super annoying Yep.

157
00:11:03,774 --> 00:11:12,325
Rym: Oh, yeah, so I the biggest thing is I did this so that now I am Disentangled from my phone in case I like drop my phone and it breaks or something happens.

158
00:11:12,425 --> 00:11:13,990
Scott: Yeah, I'm not completely disentangled.

159
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:24,049
Scott: I put the most unimportant apps and also Instagram still on a phone But I also have a backup phone now, so that's I'm okay, right I'm good.

160
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:26,720
Scott: So yeah, I just did.

161
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:31,099
Scott: I don't know if I reviewed the tiny iPhone But just briefly like super briefly.

162
00:11:31,119 --> 00:11:33,970
Rym: apparently twitch only lets you use authy specifically.

163
00:11:34,532 --> 00:11:36,678
Scott: Yes, twitch only lets you use authy specifically.

164
00:11:36,698 --> 00:11:37,560
Scott: That's also bullshit.

165
00:11:37,701 --> 00:11:41,351
Scott: cold guy point about me and twitch is the only thing that It's.

166
00:11:42,013 --> 00:11:42,876
Rym: blizzard is annoying.

167
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:47,730
Rym: blizzard makes you use the blizzard authenticator app and steam makes you use this blizzard indicator app.

168
00:11:47,991 --> 00:11:53,694
Scott: Blizzard was also what I had a slight hassle with because I haven't even used battle net in forever But I don't moved it over.

169
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:58,070
Rym: Well, I haven't logged into battle net like I haven't typed a credential in years.

170
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:01,266
Scott: Yeah, I had a little bit of hassle with blizzard, but I got it done.

171
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:06,550
Scott: steam It does make you use their own app, which is bullshit, but it works and is nice and I didn't have any hassle with it.

172
00:12:06,674 --> 00:12:12,723
Scott: so Anyway, so yeah tiny iPhone all I want to say is yeah, it's got a better screen.

173
00:12:12,784 --> 00:12:13,265
Scott: It's bad.

174
00:12:13,285 --> 00:12:14,128
Scott: It looks nicer.

175
00:12:14,228 --> 00:12:14,850
Scott: It's smaller.

176
00:12:15,413 --> 00:12:23,790
Scott: It's got a better camera, right but functionality wise It's effectively the same as the iPhone 7 which I still have and still works.

177
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:29,350
Scott: So like I could have just kept going with that iPhone 7 until it completely died and that would have been just fine.

178
00:12:29,551 --> 00:12:31,157
Rym: That's what I'm doing with my Sony.

179
00:12:31,599 --> 00:12:34,390
Scott: Yeah, I'm not disappointed though in this decision.

180
00:12:34,511 --> 00:12:37,350
Scott: I don't have any regrets because a it's good to have a backup phone.

181
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:41,789
Scott: Maybe someone else will have their phone broken and need the iPhone 7 which is still perfectly fine.

182
00:12:43,172 --> 00:12:47,252
Scott: And also I am hesitant about the rumors on the iPhone 13.

183
00:12:47,252 --> 00:12:49,544
Scott: So it's if you're gonna buy a phone it's good to get it.

184
00:12:49,564 --> 00:12:52,596
Scott: if you're gonna buy any technology It's good to get it as soon as it comes out.

185
00:12:52,998 --> 00:12:57,612
Scott: so you get the most for your money, but this iPhone 12 mini 100%.

186
00:12:57,612 --> 00:13:03,807
Scott: I will keep this until it is broken and no longer functioning in such and plus.

187
00:13:03,827 --> 00:13:07,700
Scott: the fact that has 5g I think is gonna give it, you know further life than the.

188
00:13:08,081 --> 00:13:09,345
Rym: yeah, that's what I'm lacking.

189
00:13:09,405 --> 00:13:12,857
Rym: but until kovat comes down There's no reason like 5g doesn't do anything for me.

190
00:13:12,877 --> 00:13:14,101
Rym: I mean, it doesn't do anything yet.

191
00:13:14,162 --> 00:13:14,382
Scott: Yep.

192
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:14,984
Scott: Not yet.

193
00:13:15,326 --> 00:13:16,269
Rym: I'm connected to my files.

194
00:13:17,472 --> 00:13:21,877
Scott: very tiny thing to talk about is I've been using.

195
00:13:21,897 --> 00:13:28,988
Scott: there's a thing called ansible which is an IT Automation thing along the lines of like chef puppet whatever.

196
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:35,195
Scott: Oh, yeah Some of my developers have been using that and actually so of all the ones I've tried This one's just fantastic.

197
00:13:35,255 --> 00:13:40,030
Scott: Like all the other ones were just a big hassle hard to figure out how they work giving me problems.

198
00:13:40,851 --> 00:13:42,159
Scott: Ansible is just like terrific.

199
00:13:42,199 --> 00:13:45,535
Scott: It works the way I want it to work And I'm setting it all up.

200
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:46,057
Scott: So nice.

201
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:48,467
Scott: Maybe we'll do a show on it later, but I love it.

202
00:13:48,608 --> 00:13:50,054
Scott: So That's my.

203
00:13:50,094 --> 00:13:51,057
Scott: that's my recommendation.

204
00:13:51,077 --> 00:13:56,710
Scott: Oh, yeah, if you don't want if you don't want to do if you don't want to just write shell scripts It's a lot better than writing shells.

205
00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:01,010
Rym: I mean, I'm just looking at some config examples and it without knowing anything about it actually how it works.

206
00:14:01,313 --> 00:14:02,670
Rym: The configs are very readable.

207
00:14:03,371 --> 00:14:05,076
Scott: It's still stupid YAML, but it.

208
00:14:05,838 --> 00:14:07,463
Scott: they actually made a YAML schema.

209
00:14:07,503 --> 00:14:09,570
Scott: that makes perfect sense and it's real nice.

210
00:14:09,811 --> 00:14:11,341
Rym: I guess I can deal with the animal like it does.

211
00:14:11,381 --> 00:14:15,326
Scott: I recommend I recommend Ansible it for products of that nature.

212
00:14:15,507 --> 00:14:20,256
Rym: Yeah alright, so speaking of Internet access and 5g and everything.

213
00:14:20,577 --> 00:14:25,049
Rym: There is some news from Comcast a terrible ISP, but a lot of people are stuck with them.

214
00:14:26,371 --> 00:14:36,822
Rym: So I didn't realize they've been in forties or enforcing data caps in a lot of places and now they are expanding To enforce their data caps basically everywhere.

215
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:39,290
Scott: Yeah, isn't it a very large data cap?

216
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:41,702
Scott: It's like 1.2 terabytes a month or something.

217
00:14:41,823 --> 00:14:48,816
Rym: Yep, which I have Definitely exceeded 1.2 terabytes in a month many times I think.

218
00:14:48,957 --> 00:14:58,950
Scott: even if you were a streamer and a pirater I don't think you would exceed 1.2 terabytes unless you were hosting your piracy server in your house And it was a public piracy server.

219
00:14:59,010 --> 00:14:59,251
Scott: I think.

220
00:14:59,412 --> 00:15:12,139
Scott: even if you had like a private piracy server that you were hosting for your friends I don't think you would hit 1.2 terabytes a month unless you had 1.2 terabytes of movies and your friend Copied your entire server in the month.

221
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:18,150
Rym: Well, I mean, it's like we have a really hard Devices and like we're streaming GeekNights all over.

222
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:21,670
Rym: It's less now that I know that complicated thing with multiple like yeah streams.

223
00:15:22,252 --> 00:15:36,934
Rym: But also the time when I used to like blow past those caps was back in the day when Amazon offered their unlimited cloud service and I just sent my entire NAS up to the cloud as a snapshot Every week.

224
00:15:36,974 --> 00:15:37,476
Rym: because why not?

225
00:15:37,557 --> 00:15:40,730
Scott: I wonder if the limit applies to upload and download or just one of the other.

226
00:15:40,912 --> 00:15:52,665
Rym: It's not super clear there But yeah it seems to be causing a problem for what they have a bunch of data in the article about like who exceeds the caps and Apparently like ten percent of people are exceeding that cap on a regular base.

227
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:53,508
Scott: That seems about right.

228
00:15:53,548 --> 00:16:03,174
Scott: Yeah You know, I think I guess it could also happen if for example Maybe you have a household full of people right plus first of all people are home now So they're using more bandwidth at home.

229
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:08,390
Scott: Yeah Comcast Comcast bandwidth usage just like T home TP usage went way up, right?

230
00:16:09,672 --> 00:16:13,105
Rym: The median Comcast ISP usage is 308 gigabytes a month.

231
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:15,859
Scott: That's about right.

232
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:16,282
Scott: Yeah, let's see.

233
00:16:16,403 --> 00:16:17,470
Scott: That seems like a normal number.

234
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:18,173
Scott: Yeah, but the thing is right.

235
00:16:18,193 --> 00:16:19,478
Scott: so 300 is like the median, right?

236
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:35,630
Scott: So you think two people living there if you've got a household with several people then you could suddenly start going way up Doing four different Netflix streams like for five hours.

237
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:40,182
Scott: You think you think median the median household is what like, you know.

238
00:16:40,362 --> 00:16:41,405
Scott: two point something people.

239
00:16:41,465 --> 00:16:43,350
Scott: maybe one point something people in the u.s.

240
00:16:43,511 --> 00:16:44,199
Scott: I don't know, right?

241
00:16:44,584 --> 00:16:51,995
Scott: I'm guessing but You know, so two people or roommates, okay Here's the biggest one.

242
00:16:52,256 --> 00:16:52,958
Rym: say remember it.

243
00:16:53,119 --> 00:16:57,877
Rym: remember when we like say four of us lived in an apartment in colony like the four Of us who were hanging out somewhere.

244
00:16:57,897 --> 00:17:06,540
Rym: We're all living somewhere in modern times and We all buy a new game and there's an update to that game and it's 200 gigabytes.

245
00:17:06,641 --> 00:17:07,888
Rym: cuz it's a big download.

246
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:10,285
Scott: Yeah, and you download it four times.

247
00:17:10,345 --> 00:17:12,275
Scott: Yep That's what I'm saying.

248
00:17:12,295 --> 00:17:16,190
Scott: So like the 300 gigabytes is probably measuring like one to two.

249
00:17:16,971 --> 00:17:27,970
Scott: Normal ish Netflix II watch II people if you've got four plus big time download II gamer Streamy piratey people, right?

250
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:32,690
Scott: That's where you're hitting the 1.2 terabytes and 10% of people falling into that category.

251
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:37,747
Scott: 10% of like Comcast customer accounts falling into that category seems normal.

252
00:17:37,787 --> 00:17:37,947
Scott: right.

253
00:17:38,068 --> 00:17:39,011
Scott: one in ten How?

254
00:17:39,031 --> 00:17:49,835
Rym: but it is interesting because the parents this article the reason they didn't Enforce these cats before they enforce them everywhere except the Northeast like New York.

255
00:17:50,457 --> 00:17:56,770
Rym: and the reason they didn't enforce it here was specifically because Everyone here has access to files which is uncapped.

256
00:17:59,223 --> 00:18:01,049
Rym: Yep, like straight up which.

257
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,036
Rym: that's the part that I think is interesting.

258
00:18:03,096 --> 00:18:13,460
Rym: Comcast basically admitted as part of this whole thing that Competition forced them to give better service to people who lived in places with more competition.

259
00:18:13,944 --> 00:18:14,891
Rym: And now they're saying fuck it.

260
00:18:15,012 --> 00:18:15,960
Rym: We're service for everybody.

261
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:22,413
Rym: Mmm Zoom calls and things like that are also pushing people's bandwidth way up.

262
00:18:22,774 --> 00:18:24,360
Scott: They are using a lot.

263
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,208
Scott: But I've got a kid.

264
00:18:25,389 --> 00:18:26,400
Rym: you've got two kids in school.

265
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,818
Rym: They are on a video call for like seven hours a day five days a week.

266
00:18:31,821 --> 00:18:37,677
Scott: Sure, that is using a significant amount of bandwidth but zoom really is giving you low resolution video.

267
00:18:37,718 --> 00:18:40,225
Scott: those aren't 1080p Those aren't 1080p.

268
00:18:40,225 --> 00:18:41,772
Scott: 60 streams on zoom, right?

269
00:18:41,812 --> 00:18:46,611
Scott: Those are like 640 by 480 30 at maybe 15 frames, right?

270
00:18:46,631 --> 00:18:47,013
Scott: They're not.

271
00:18:47,274 --> 00:18:51,347
Scott: they're not high quality Yep, so the article.

272
00:18:51,428 --> 00:18:53,014
Rym: you can read this article to see all the details like.

273
00:18:53,054 --> 00:19:01,613
Rym: I don't dive into it but there's some interesting points here about how The data caps don't actually protect like the networks in any way.

274
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:03,820
Rym: They're solely not a monetization.

275
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:08,720
Rym: Absolutely, it does not cost them materially more to hazard that bandwidth.

276
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,890
Scott: It once you have the cable set up it did.

277
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:14,760
Scott: the marginal cost of data moving over the cable is zero.

278
00:19:15,061 --> 00:19:15,684
Scott: I think it's it.

279
00:19:15,704 --> 00:19:16,308
Scott: Well, it's not zero.

280
00:19:16,348 --> 00:19:17,051
Scott: It's the electricity.

281
00:19:17,212 --> 00:19:17,534
Scott: That's it.

282
00:19:17,675 --> 00:19:22,420
Scott: Yep, right the laser Whatever it is, and this goes back to an original the laser is gonna be on all day.

283
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,162
Scott: So it's like you're.

284
00:19:23,564 --> 00:19:28,479
Rym: it's just a fixed cost basically, but we've talked about this a lot and I'm gonna keep saying it.

285
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:34,960
Rym: Internet access needs to be provided by the US post service postal service in America and be a guaranteed.

286
00:19:35,061 --> 00:19:37,980
Scott: Doesn't that mean it doesn't have to be the post office specifically?

287
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:49,780
Scott: But it's just like it should be a guaranteed thing the same way that telephone service was and like a private company could be allowed to provide an ISP To compete with that, but it could be some sort of weird.

288
00:19:50,803 --> 00:19:56,217
Scott: It just needs to be mandated and regulated at the same way that all the other just utilities are.

289
00:19:56,277 --> 00:19:59,408
Scott: it shouldn't be like this special service you subscribe to.

290
00:19:59,468 --> 00:20:06,940
Scott: right the way it is now in the US at least is Paying an ISP for internet access is no different than paying like Netflix for a subscription.

291
00:20:07,141 --> 00:20:10,740
Rym: It's a luxury magazine treated like a luxury, but it's really a necessity.

292
00:20:10,841 --> 00:20:14,003
Rym: It's as important as electricity and water in the modern It needs to be.

293
00:20:14,043 --> 00:20:17,799
Scott: it needs to be the same as you know, telephone electricity water, etc.

294
00:20:18,421 --> 00:20:32,160
Scott: And also by the way, this is not true in the US but it should be is that if you fail to pay a water electric heating Internet phone bill that they shouldn't be able to cut it off.

295
00:20:32,762 --> 00:20:38,580
Scott: They should never be allowed to cut you off unless the place to which the service is being provided is truly uninhabited.

296
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:42,640
Scott: Otherwise, they should not be able to cut you off no matter how much bill you fail to pay.

297
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:43,703
Rym: There are limited.

298
00:20:43,723 --> 00:20:47,555
Rym: there are certain rules around electricity in the US for people.

299
00:20:47,575 --> 00:20:53,875
Rym: if someone registers that in their house They have like certain kinds of medical equipment, but those protections are few and far between.

300
00:20:54,176 --> 00:20:54,798
Rym: and for internet.

301
00:20:54,858 --> 00:20:57,605
Scott: There's nothing Yep, I mean for phones.

302
00:20:57,686 --> 00:21:02,920
Scott: all there is is if you don't pay your phone bill the phone will still call 911 and nothing else.

303
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:14,258
Rym: Yep, also, don't forget a lot of people don't realize this especially younger people if you have an old cell phone It can always call 911 even if there's no SIM card any any telephone in the United States.

304
00:21:14,338 --> 00:21:26,449
Scott: that is like hooked up in any way like op functioning right plugged into the wall a cell phone with no SIM card that still powers on properly if It's a United States phone in the US.

305
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,054
Scott: You can call 911 on it.

306
00:21:28,175 --> 00:21:36,532
Scott: No matter what, right so You can pick up like a $1 flip phone That is 3g on like about razor or something from.

307
00:21:36,552 --> 00:21:44,220
Scott: you know, it'll actually be pretty cool to have a flip Right in 2020 that can call 911 even though it can't call anything.

308
00:21:44,381 --> 00:21:46,510
Scott: I realize you could actually get service for it and call.

309
00:21:46,812 --> 00:21:54,360
Rym: when I was migrating my phone I actually forgot to migrate the SIM card and didn't notice for like two weeks cuz how would I notice?

310
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,686
Scott: Yeah, how would you do the iPhone?

311
00:21:56,767 --> 00:22:04,699
Scott: So I don't know if you know this but when you migrate an iPhone All you do is hold your old iPhone near your new one and that's it

312
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:11,860
Rym: Yep, actually the so androids don't like have the same thing by default, but the sony has one little thing built in that'll do that.

313
00:22:13,442 --> 00:22:18,450
Scott: Yeah, but like you turn on a new iPhone and since I when I bought it I bought it from Apple and I know where they already knew who I was.

314
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,680
Scott: they knew right they knew my Verizon account.

315
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,751
Scott: So they're just like hey Scott hold your old iPhone near this new one.

316
00:22:24,292 --> 00:22:25,637
Scott: All right, and then it just worked.

317
00:22:25,858 --> 00:22:28,747
Scott: the end So apps everything.

318
00:22:29,169 --> 00:22:34,712
Rym: so in some other news we can't go too deep into it now But those Apple m1 chips are out and there's.

319
00:22:35,214 --> 00:22:37,279
Rym: there's a lot going on there Yep.

320
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:47,703
Scott: so the all you really need to know long and short of it is that the Apple m1 CPU by all accounts and benchmarks and things we've seen is Up to the hype.

321
00:22:47,844 --> 00:22:53,440
Scott: it is maybe the best consumer CPU general-purpose CPU available.

322
00:22:54,401 --> 00:23:05,020
Scott: Period right - right short of like maybe some ridiculously overclocked i9s or something with the caveat Nonsense that that is only true just like the old days with those alpha chips.

323
00:23:05,462 --> 00:23:07,611
Rym: It's only true if your shit is compiled for them.

324
00:23:08,394 --> 00:23:08,575
Scott: Yep.

325
00:23:08,655 --> 00:23:09,217
Scott: Well, that's true.

326
00:23:09,338 --> 00:23:18,676
Scott: Well, no Well, actually I saw some benchmarks that were indicating that there were some x86 programs and not jokey ones like even Adobe ones.

327
00:23:18,737 --> 00:23:31,383
Scott: Yeah that Using Apple's Rosetta - right - emulation API whatever layer they have to make x86 apps run on the ARM CPU We're.

328
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:37,700
Scott: actually it's the chip is so good that they were running faster through Rosetta - than they were on native chips.

329
00:23:37,901 --> 00:23:41,600
Rym: Now I saw talk of that too, but I didn't actually read those articles yet.

330
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,847
Rym: So I'm not I wasn't like sure.

331
00:23:43,651 --> 00:23:45,240
Scott: the point is it's ridiculously fast.

332
00:23:45,381 --> 00:23:56,406
Scott: The problem is as always with Apple is that the GPU That they give you that sort of built-in is not shabby and they have you know All their their fancy metal.

333
00:23:56,507 --> 00:24:00,420
Scott: whatever GPU stuff like you can get good graphics going on an Apple computer.

334
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:00,802
Scott: There's no.

335
00:24:00,842 --> 00:24:04,719
Rym: even got the neural engine type stuff that like a modern Nvidia card has.

336
00:24:05,802 --> 00:24:09,120
Scott: Yeah, well, I mean that's all built into the the CPU even on I've got right.

337
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:18,115
Scott: But that GPU is still compared to like an Nvidia even 2080. yeah, like it's not.

338
00:24:18,276 --> 00:24:25,080
Scott: it's not it Right, and the reason is because the the ARM CPU that Apple has is actually cares about being power efficient, right?

339
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,959
Scott: They won't want your battery to just die.

340
00:24:27,482 --> 00:24:30,454
Scott: Nvidia GPUs ARM, you know AMD GPUs.

341
00:24:30,855 --> 00:24:32,000
Scott: They don't give a shit about power.

342
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,054
Scott: Look how you have to plug extra power cables into them from your powers.

343
00:24:35,114 --> 00:24:36,561
Rym: I actually get a 3080.

344
00:24:36,561 --> 00:24:37,485
Rym: I did the calculation.

345
00:24:37,505 --> 00:24:40,900
Rym: I have to upgrade the fucking power supply in my computer, right?

346
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:44,480
Scott: Is there basically like hot rods with the engine sticking out the top of the hood?

347
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:48,019
Scott: That's why they're so fast because they're just like give me that electricity room

348
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:53,900
Rym: Right and one end there because most people do not need that kind of power and it'd be better people use less

349
00:24:54,121 --> 00:24:54,502
Scott: Exactly,

350
00:24:54,782 --> 00:25:00,739
Rym: but at the same time it means apples will continue to be completely useless for the vast majority of gaming.

351
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:04,014
Scott: if Apple made a computer, right?

352
00:25:04,054 --> 00:25:04,536
Scott: I don't know why.

353
00:25:04,577 --> 00:25:05,160
Scott: the Mac Pro?

354
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,345
Scott: They don't just fucking do it.

355
00:25:06,686 --> 00:25:10,100
Scott: put the m1 or like m1 bionic that they'll come out with of course.

356
00:25:11,141 --> 00:25:13,027
Rym: Let me just put a real video card in there.

357
00:25:13,267 --> 00:25:27,640
Scott: put a fucking Nvidia 3080 in there and that will be the most powerful desktop computer on earth no question and Everyone will pretty much have no choice If they want the powerful computer to do any sort of professional work to buy that computer?

358
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:34,480
Scott: Yes Intel even AMD which is burning out Intel because Intel's in the deep shit won't be able to hold any candles to that.

359
00:25:34,962 --> 00:25:36,328
Scott: I would even maybe have to buy one.

360
00:25:36,529 --> 00:25:39,100
Scott: and you know five or six years from now when I get a computer.

361
00:25:39,723 --> 00:25:42,997
Scott: So my advice is there's still hiccups now because it's still.

362
00:25:43,379 --> 00:25:48,019
Scott: you know People are still recompiling their software to get it over to ARM and all that, right?

363
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:52,459
Scott: The m2 I think is gonna be unbelievable.

364
00:25:53,182 --> 00:26:02,319
Rym: I'm glad I'm at a point where I can wait because I spent a lot of money on my workstation Years, I say if right your current computer hold on to it as long as you can.

365
00:26:02,801 --> 00:26:15,040
Scott: But if your current computer is right wait one to two years to see that m2 CPU come out Before you go and buy an Intel or an AMD CPU or something else.

366
00:26:15,501 --> 00:26:20,099
Scott: Right because it is probably gonna be like think about the difference between an iPhone one and an iPhone 3g.

367
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:25,576
Scott: Look at how like the I the crappy iPod versus like iPod nano, right?

368
00:26:25,837 --> 00:26:27,666
Scott: That's the kind of jump We're gonna see here.

369
00:26:27,747 --> 00:26:29,560
Scott: and the the one is already ridiculous.

370
00:26:29,683 --> 00:26:34,452
Rym: Yeah No, it has one caveat, but this will not up.

371
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:36,260
Rym: that's important other than the video card thing.

372
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,966
Rym: That does not really apply to most people.

373
00:26:38,508 --> 00:26:39,832
Scott: the 16 Meg 16 gigs ram.

374
00:26:40,013 --> 00:26:41,920
Rym: Yeah, you cannot have that much RAM.

375
00:26:42,582 --> 00:26:45,152
Scott: You can't have more than 16 gigs ram and you know why.

376
00:26:45,172 --> 00:26:47,200
Scott: it's actually sort of a plus and a minus.

377
00:26:47,623 --> 00:26:48,551
Scott: You can't add more RAM.

378
00:26:48,572 --> 00:26:49,620
Scott: You're stuck with 16.

379
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,243
Scott: It's like okay.

380
00:26:50,243 --> 00:26:51,830
Scott: 16 is enough, but I like having 32.

381
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,859
Scott: I've had 32 for a long time, right?

382
00:26:54,542 --> 00:26:57,010
Scott: But why can't you have more than 16?

383
00:26:57,010 --> 00:27:00,100
Scott: because they put the 16 gigs of RAM in the damn chip.

384
00:27:00,321 --> 00:27:02,428
Scott: It's not dims over next to the chip.

385
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,933
Scott: It's fucking in the CPU.

386
00:27:03,993 --> 00:27:05,117
Scott: The RAM is in there.

387
00:27:05,197 --> 00:27:05,960
Scott: It's inside.

388
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:12,380
Scott: It's the fastest goddamn RAM you can get maybe anywhere but definitely in a consumer computer.

389
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,466
Scott: It's sort of unbelievable.

390
00:27:14,506 --> 00:27:17,580
Scott: Do you would you rather have twice as much or would you rather have half as much?

391
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,960
Rym: That's like ridiculously fast, but there is one thing that it will not be able to do better right now.

392
00:27:24,162 --> 00:27:29,799
Rym: but this is such an edge case that it You probably takes more than 16 gigs of RAM at once.

393
00:27:30,462 --> 00:27:35,680
Rym: Oh, I mean, I've used more than 16 gigs around when I'm editing video and doing effects that I can't render in GPU.

394
00:27:36,663 --> 00:27:40,707
Scott: Yeah, I'm pretty sure stabilizers Like I can do that.

395
00:27:41,129 --> 00:27:59,194
Rym: I have a feeling if you buy like a Mac Well, this is what I wonder it has how we'll just fine extreme high-end Rendering stuff work on this compared to like an Intel box with a real GPU I'm sure it will be possibly if not comparable.

396
00:27:59,475 --> 00:28:00,178
Scott: It might be better.

397
00:28:00,258 --> 00:28:04,220
Scott: I can't imagine I don't know, but if you could be it could be worse.

398
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,540
Scott: But if it is worse, it will will be slightly worse not severely.

399
00:28:07,583 --> 00:28:27,627
Rym: Yeah If you're doing stuff that is usually only the realm of like Wall Street or like weird performance computing Where the task you are doing is bound primarily by number of transactions per second as opposed to any other factor Like an old Pentium 3 could theoretically outperform this thing for a single threaded Like direct task.

400
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:38,149
Rym: if you overclocked it because it maxes out at 3.2 gigahertz It's not super comparable to like the clock speed of an Intel or an AMD chip Because it's a different instruction set.

401
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:40,579
Rym: what it can do with one clock tick is different.

402
00:28:41,402 --> 00:28:51,280
Rym: But true if you're if you're doing very discrete linear non-parallel things 3.2 gigahertz is kind of slow, but it's not that much slower.

403
00:28:51,641 --> 00:28:57,599
Rym: The best in Intel chips gonna do without overclocking it is like four four and a half like you're not that much faster.

404
00:28:58,307 --> 00:28:58,980
Scott: Well, I mean, you know.

405
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:04,095
Scott: But if you're taking advantage of neural engine how many less how much more efficient is your program?

406
00:29:04,155 --> 00:29:12,677
Scott: if your program is suddenly like big Oh and instead of big oh, you know, yeah and log the neural engine only apply to the GPU rendering though.

407
00:29:12,697 --> 00:29:14,262
Scott: I Don't.

408
00:29:14,363 --> 00:29:16,820
Rym: I thought that only applied to regular units for GPU stuff.

409
00:29:17,902 --> 00:29:21,379
Scott: I'm pretty sure it's for like any sort of like machine learning type.

410
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:24,431
Rym: Oh, yeah You could run machine learning stuff on it or you can run.

411
00:29:24,452 --> 00:29:27,403
Rym: you can use it for rendering because that's why the E80 is so big.

412
00:29:27,423 --> 00:29:30,735
Rym: the 3080 can do AI rendering or like.

413
00:29:30,776 --> 00:29:35,059
Rym: when the CUDA cores first came out You could run software that just uses them to do AI stuff directly.

414
00:29:36,381 --> 00:29:41,200
Scott: But I mean pretty much any application that you have you that you can map to the neural engines.

415
00:29:41,561 --> 00:29:42,684
Scott: You know functionality.

416
00:29:42,825 --> 00:29:49,598
Rym: just like when early video cards and we had those CUDA cores people could write software that would map to CUDA cores And get ridiculous performance.

417
00:29:50,565 --> 00:29:53,200
Rym: Yep, but yeah, this is my point that point about the clock speeds.

418
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:57,231
Rym: But unless you already know that this applies to you.

419
00:29:57,251 --> 00:29:59,338
Rym: It definitely does not apply to anything you're doing.

420
00:30:00,647 --> 00:30:03,423
Rym: Yeah And some other really brief news.

421
00:30:03,704 --> 00:30:11,379
Rym: you might have seen that Twitter if you're using the regular Twitter app a bunch of broken weird stuff appeared at the top that everyone's trying to ignore.

422
00:30:13,401 --> 00:30:21,333
Rym: Twitter added a feature that basically no one seemed to want as they keep doing Probably to try to compete with like tick tock or whatever.

423
00:30:21,795 --> 00:30:30,849
Rym: They basically added Ephemeral tweets that they call fleets that you can fleet something and 24 hours later Seen or used a fleet.

424
00:30:30,949 --> 00:30:35,409
Scott: because I don't use the default Twitter app on any platform I use tweet deck tweet by.

425
00:30:35,489 --> 00:30:45,476
Rym: I installed the regular app again And I posted one fleet that asked Twitter why they made this harassment prone abusive feature instead of just banning the Nazis And then I uninstalled the client again.

426
00:30:46,382 --> 00:30:48,754
Rym: Yeah, so there is a fleet out there that I posted.

427
00:30:48,795 --> 00:30:49,699
Rym: I guess you can still see it.

428
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:55,640
Rym: Hmm, but I guess I'm not gonna go deep into it because it's not super tech news.

429
00:30:56,142 --> 00:30:59,619
Rym: Twitter's a company that is in the tech sector social media, etc.

430
00:30:59,961 --> 00:31:06,263
Rym: But the thing that bothers me about fleet specifically that you should think about forget the annoyance of them adding a feature Like.

431
00:31:06,283 --> 00:31:07,412
Rym: there's a lot of reasons for that.

432
00:31:07,452 --> 00:31:08,219
Rym: We can talk about it.

433
00:31:08,721 --> 00:31:13,340
Rym: The problem is this is the kind of feature that is extremely prone to abuse.

434
00:31:13,803 --> 00:31:23,140
Rym: I can make a tweet that adds someone and Harasses them or gets my love followers to harass that person that automatically disappears in 24 hours to cover my tracks.

435
00:31:23,942 --> 00:31:25,279
Rym: That's how well gonna get used.

436
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:31,443
Scott: Right, of course, but Twitter like no one else would be able to see like, you know You like.

437
00:31:31,463 --> 00:31:36,567
Scott: if I harass someone and you don't hear about it for a day You wouldn't be able to see that.

438
00:31:36,607 --> 00:31:42,427
Scott: I did that but Twitter would presumably not actually delete them But just remove them from visibility.

439
00:31:42,447 --> 00:31:45,620
Scott: Yep, and therefore could then still find people who had done her.

440
00:31:45,841 --> 00:31:55,923
Rym: I don't like but they tend not to and what this means that you can't do is if you are Harassed it is very hard to prove your case without taking Twitter to court To get that.

441
00:31:56,024 --> 00:31:56,405
Scott: also.

442
00:31:56,767 --> 00:32:03,810
Scott: there was Twitter apparently did have some problems where yes You could actually access fleets 24 hours after due to.

443
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,936
Rym: I just saw that news.

444
00:32:06,017 --> 00:32:09,010
Scott: I didn't read the article yet Which proves that I think they're.

445
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:10,980
Scott: you know, like I said, they're not actually deleting them.

446
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:16,538
Scott: They're just you know, basically to change the SQL query is like select fleets where date time less than 24 hours, right?

447
00:32:18,066 --> 00:32:20,280
Scott: And they're keeping all the fleets forever in the database.

448
00:32:21,261 --> 00:32:31,078
Scott: But I think they're gonna fix that query or it's to make it so that through no public facing API Can anyone access old fleets and only internal people can access them?

449
00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:40,119
Rym: Yep so last and least and I have almost nothing to say about this turns out the GIMP is 25 years old.

450
00:32:42,456 --> 00:32:44,330
Rym: It had its birthday today.

451
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:45,797
Scott: No the cause.

452
00:32:45,817 --> 00:32:47,365
Scott: there's a lot of things with birthdays lately.

453
00:32:47,405 --> 00:32:50,715
Scott: Mario's 35 Right.

454
00:32:50,755 --> 00:32:53,493
Scott: What else is Microsoft Windows is 35.

455
00:32:53,493 --> 00:33:00,850
Rym: so I went and I looked at the GIMP to see like how because I you know, I just use Photoshop since I started paying for Adobe like I haven't I haven't looked at the GIMP in so long.

456
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:02,298
Rym: So I open it up to see.

457
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:08,062
Rym: hey, I know it's been like falling behind Commercial tools further and further, but it's real bad.

458
00:33:08,242 --> 00:33:09,668
Scott: How bad can real Photoshop?

459
00:33:09,789 --> 00:33:12,118
Rym: it is unusable.

460
00:33:12,831 --> 00:33:19,189
Scott: Photoshop just added a feature where you can automatically replace the sky in a photo with a different sky.

461
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:30,950
Scott: Photoshop Just like a feature right a picture of Scott and tell Photoshop to make him happier and look at the looks like People who are like, you know, I don't need that whatever but it's like you don't understand.

462
00:33:31,171 --> 00:33:35,266
Scott: There's someone else who does need that and that's why Photoshop costs that amount of money.

463
00:33:35,327 --> 00:33:36,090
Scott: if you don't need that.

464
00:33:36,553 --> 00:33:38,450
Scott: Yeah, go use junky old GIMP, right?

465
00:33:39,094 --> 00:33:45,850
Rym: But even then all GIMP can do well Like I was trying to use the GIMP a little bit is you can resize images and that's pretty much it.

466
00:33:45,931 --> 00:33:52,988
Scott: I still can't use the vast majority the vast majority of image editing that people need to do normal people on a daily basis.

467
00:33:53,048 --> 00:33:56,798
Scott: resize is Crop resize filter and you know what?

468
00:33:57,079 --> 00:33:58,102
Scott: You don't need to use the GIMP.

469
00:33:58,143 --> 00:34:00,350
Scott: There's a million little phone apps that do that.

470
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:04,503
Scott: There's now Windows like Windows has the the windows built-in photos app.

471
00:34:04,523 --> 00:34:05,567
Scott: It's called photos.

472
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:07,856
Scott: It's just Windows 10 You can do.

473
00:34:07,956 --> 00:34:10,750
Scott: you can crop edit whatever with that little app you don't need.

474
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:12,105
Scott: You know.

475
00:34:12,975 --> 00:34:14,949
Scott: There there is just like photos on Windows.

476
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,597
Scott: This is Windows 10. this.

477
00:34:16,899 --> 00:34:20,830
Rym: the reason I bring this news up is it brings a culmination something I've talked about off and on over the years.

478
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:40,149
Rym: I haven't talked about this on GeekNights in like a decade But there was an era when like a bunch of open source desktop Applications appeared like the GIMP open office and at the time They did most of what the commercial equivalents would do and as a result they were for most people actually better because they were free

479
00:34:41,331 --> 00:34:46,030
Scott: Exactly open office compared to Microsoft Office at the time was just like put any Microsoft Office.

480
00:34:46,571 --> 00:35:18,369
Rym: But what the GIMP lacks and what a lot of these open source desktop projects lack aside from UX aside from like documentation aside from like actually thinking about what people want to do they lacked R&D and The features that got added to like Photoshop equivalents over the years could not be replicated by the open source community and this argument that Open source tools will be will be able to like sustain this baseline usage among people Didn't really pan out for a lot of sectors

481
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:19,410
Scott: All right.

482
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:19,892
Scott: Well, I mean it.

483
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:26,889
Scott: you could easily look at features that that the professional abs developed and sort of cop Try to copy them which is what these things tended to do.

484
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:30,410
Rym: But they got a point where those features are very difficult to develop, right?

485
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:32,457
Scott: We've reached the point where it's like, yeah.

486
00:35:32,558 --> 00:35:36,050
Scott: Okay, you want to copy the you know, you want to copy the cropper?

487
00:35:36,191 --> 00:35:36,897
Scott: We can copy that.

488
00:35:36,978 --> 00:35:38,330
Scott: Yeah, you want to copy brushes?

489
00:35:38,654 --> 00:35:49,451
Scott: Okay We can copy customizable brushes and then it's up to the people to make the brushes themselves copy the entirety of the like alpha masking layer stuff that Photoshop does Right.

490
00:35:50,013 --> 00:35:50,314
Scott: Okay.

491
00:35:50,334 --> 00:35:54,244
Scott: We got a copy the sky replacer and it's like who's gonna copy.

492
00:35:54,284 --> 00:36:08,030
Scott: who's gonna sit there and code the Sky replacer, you know on their own for free give it away for free and it's gonna work as good as if not better than The Photoshop one to the point at which a professional photographer can actually use it.

493
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:12,490
Scott: No, no, no, but basically anyone who is anyone who is good enough to code.

494
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:15,325
Scott: The sky replacer is already working at Adobe.

495
00:36:15,385 --> 00:36:21,305
Rym: their archer set sir Right, but and like audacity is a good example of this too.

496
00:36:21,606 --> 00:36:33,790
Rym: It's pretty good or Apple Yeah for audio But even like that all this open-source software They basically implemented all the relatively easy low-hanging fruit and they all kind of just stopped getting better.

497
00:36:35,452 --> 00:36:44,040
Rym: Mmm, and I don't know if open source like desktop applications will ever start progressing again at the rate that commercial software is.

498
00:36:46,173 --> 00:36:50,125
Rym: Yeah, I don't know - he's never gonna have a real D reverb.

499
00:36:50,165 --> 00:36:51,088
Rym: that just works.

500
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:55,720
Rym: but Adobe Audition literally added a D reverb function.

501
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,686
Rym: I can click a button it removes reverb.

502
00:36:58,028 --> 00:36:58,770
Rym: It just works.

503
00:36:58,991 --> 00:36:59,897
Rym: I don't have to do anything.

504
00:36:59,958 --> 00:37:01,045
Rym: It saves me so much time.

505
00:37:01,105 --> 00:37:01,468
Rym: It's like magic.

506
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,669
Scott: It just cost you money.

507
00:37:06,853 --> 00:37:10,363
Rym: but anyway things Of the day.

508
00:37:10,685 --> 00:37:11,390
Rym: so check this out.

509
00:37:11,831 --> 00:37:27,649
Rym: I found a channel that is not what I've linked to before but it's about like civilian like civic engineering and dams and stuff And it's about how this particular turbine engine in a particular dam I think in got a screw dropped into it.

510
00:37:29,952 --> 00:37:42,710
Rym: Well, we do get to see like someone like starts grinding down the gears on this turbine but it's a. it's the turbine in a dam that is 92% efficient at turning water falling through it into electricity.

511
00:37:43,252 --> 00:37:46,642
Scott: Yeah, hydro is really good, but this is particularly efficient to hide.

512
00:37:46,663 --> 00:37:53,070
Scott: the side effects of hydro are not energy loss And if it at least not the major, it's environmental destruction in the local rights environmental structure.

513
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:57,750
Scott: We're building a dam and flooding places and un flooding places and fishes and that sort of thing.

514
00:37:57,810 --> 00:38:10,232
Rym: Yep, but this video is really cool because it talks about how you get such an Extreme amount of efficiency from what is actually a very very simple physical device Like this.

515
00:38:10,272 --> 00:38:18,909
Rym: dam is not complicated by any measure No, but the reason I'm making this my thing of the day is not because of that.

516
00:38:19,831 --> 00:38:20,756
Rym: That alone is cool.

517
00:38:20,937 --> 00:38:21,581
Rym: Like this that can I?

518
00:38:21,601 --> 00:38:23,270
Rym: this is the kinds of videos I watch all the time.

519
00:38:23,351 --> 00:38:40,050
Rym: This is like just my jam But the reason I make is my thing of the day is about midway through the video the dude who is explaining it all Like the youtubey person who was like there in the dam interviewing people is sitting in a chair About a foot away from the actual spinning turbine

520
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:41,553
Scott: Mmm,

521
00:38:42,014 --> 00:38:44,102
Rym: like just sitting there like if he touched it.

522
00:38:44,243 --> 00:38:46,129
Rym: I just imagined he would be turned into a mist

523
00:38:47,351 --> 00:38:48,095
Scott: Probably and

524
00:38:48,155 --> 00:39:04,090
Rym: then he turns around and he's very careful but he holds one of those little light bike generators up to it and holds a light bulb connected to it and Touches the spinning thing to this massive turbine for real and lights it up.

525
00:39:04,692 --> 00:39:09,870
Rym: And I had to like a cringe and actually like pause the video to figure out if this was an effect or real.

526
00:39:10,292 --> 00:39:10,675
Rym: He did it.

527
00:39:10,795 --> 00:39:13,210
Rym: He just sat there and touch this turbine.

528
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:17,430
Rym: Okay, that is why this video is my thing of the day.

529
00:39:19,393 --> 00:39:22,167
Rym: Okay So what do you got?

530
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:24,095
Scott: What do I have?

531
00:39:24,176 --> 00:39:25,690
Scott: so speaking of Photoshop?

532
00:39:25,871 --> 00:39:29,390
Scott: Here's some photographers that probably use some Photoshop judging by these images.

533
00:39:30,531 --> 00:39:39,941
Scott: So what we have here is the 2020 ocean photographer of the Year award From oceanographic magazine the winners and finalists.

534
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:43,230
Scott: So we got a. you know, we like fishes you like oceans, right?

535
00:39:44,071 --> 00:39:47,079
Scott: Here are some really unbelievable photos.

536
00:39:47,179 --> 00:39:48,603
Scott: I can't believe this is someone's job.

537
00:39:48,643 --> 00:39:49,706
Scott: basically is to go to the.

538
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:50,990
Scott: just take photos of the ocean.

539
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:51,452
Scott: What do you do?

540
00:39:51,553 --> 00:39:52,577
Scott: I'm an ocean photographer.

541
00:39:52,597 --> 00:39:53,662
Scott: That's my whole job, right?

542
00:39:53,803 --> 00:39:54,707
Scott: There's people out there.

543
00:39:54,747 --> 00:40:05,423
Scott: That's their job and here is their greatest works of the year and I think it's something anyone can just really appreciate Unless you were really scared of fish or the sea.

544
00:40:05,443 --> 00:40:08,682
Scott: I Imagine most people will enjoy this right?

545
00:40:08,702 --> 00:40:12,782
Scott: This is some good photos Yeah, but it's the kind of you know, this is the kind of thing where it's like.

546
00:40:13,064 --> 00:40:21,997
Scott: it's something everyone would enjoy But it doesn't really go viral and get around even though it feels like everyone would like it And share it if they if it got to them.

547
00:40:22,138 --> 00:40:23,983
Scott: so stool spreading, right?

548
00:40:24,405 --> 00:40:24,786
Scott: All right.

549
00:40:24,826 --> 00:40:26,713
Scott: Appreciate some ocean Photographies.

550
00:40:27,135 --> 00:40:30,130
Rym: so in the better moment, we're still stuck at home.

551
00:40:30,351 --> 00:40:38,270
Rym: I have not read more tale of Genji because I have not received a message Saying that you have read more tale of Genji, but I received a message that you have escalated.

552
00:40:39,272 --> 00:40:39,956
Scott: No, I have not.

553
00:40:40,358 --> 00:40:42,349
Rym: In fact, I started reading another nonfiction book.

554
00:40:44,231 --> 00:40:45,335
Scott: I've read some comic books.

555
00:40:45,857 --> 00:40:46,942
Rym: I'm reading a lot of nonfiction.

556
00:40:47,605 --> 00:40:48,789
Rym: I did also finish decadence.

557
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:50,914
Scott: Okay, it's good stuff.

558
00:40:51,757 --> 00:40:52,259
Scott: How about that?

559
00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:53,082
Scott: How about that dense?

560
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:53,825
Rym: Yep.

561
00:40:53,945 --> 00:40:55,150
Rym: It was uh, it was decadent.

562
00:40:56,852 --> 00:40:59,970
Rym: There was a. there was a punch at the end that it was appropriately punchy.

563
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:02,264
Rym: Yeah, it's a good show.

564
00:41:03,332 --> 00:41:05,539
Rym: So yeah, follow us like join our discord.

565
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,964
Rym: our forums been hopping again.

Rym: read our GeekNights code of conduct.

567
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:09,593
Rym: We've updated it.

568
00:41:09,974 --> 00:41:15,794
Rym: If you have feedback about our code of conduct, just check it out and get like get make some changes Give us pull

569
00:41:15,834 --> 00:41:22,803
Scott: requests or just tell us via any means of telling us things, you know You can also just use any means of telling us things to tell us things right?

573
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:44,388
Scott: You know, I'm not working this week and after this week I'm only working seven more days this year and I then I will not be working again until January 4th.

574
00:41:45,131 --> 00:41:50,179
Scott: So you can expect me to be doing something Probably biking at least at the very least.

575
00:41:50,239 --> 00:42:05,390
Scott: I'll be doing more biking to nowhere in my house And you can watch me do that on my twitch channel and come talk to me because if people talk to me it makes it Go a lot faster Yeah, or at least feel like it's going a lot faster because I'm paying attention to chatting and not to my legs or whatever.

576
00:42:05,511 --> 00:42:10,035
Scott: So and that's another way you can DM us Talk to us.

00:42:10,276 --> 00:42:13,352
Rym: I also will say this I did a show reason celebrities You can't reach.

578
00:42:13,714 --> 00:42:21,303
Rym: we did a show recently on now ricochet the tooth the year 2000 mod to half-life Been playing it off and on on the private server.

579
00:42:21,343 --> 00:42:22,708
Rym: that super peachy set up.

580
00:42:24,053 --> 00:42:25,544
Scott: Yeah, we I'm ready for gaming.

581
00:42:25,625 --> 00:42:27,155
Scott: I'm not working I remind you.

582
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:29,430
Rym: and uh ricochet is real fun.

583
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:47,041
Rym: And what I've ever noticed is that when Scott and I play ricochet, we've only done it a few times so far One of us will dominate for a while, but then the other one will like remember some old strategy or gnosis or gain a skill and then that person will dominate for a while and we keep like Leapfrogging each other and ending up pretty even it's.

584
00:42:47,202 --> 00:42:48,829
Rym: uh, that game has depth.

585
00:42:49,832 --> 00:42:51,862
Scott: I still feel like on the maps that have an upper level.

586
00:42:51,942 --> 00:42:54,615
Scott: It's like get on the upper level alone Stay there pull down.

587
00:42:55,158 --> 00:43:01,417
Rym: Well when we were playing that big super multiplayer very It was whoever farmed the most like.

588
00:43:01,457 --> 00:43:09,680
Rym: sometimes I'd like I'd finally get up there and you've been farming power-ups the whole time and I Get up there and I see just a wave of decapitating ice.

589
00:43:09,761 --> 00:43:10,703
Rym: triple shots fast.

590
00:43:10,723 --> 00:43:15,199
Rym: Just like coming at me like a catastrophe Like what the fuck do you do?

591
00:43:15,219 --> 00:43:15,239
Rym: I?

592
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:20,050
Scott: Just I stay up there alone bouncing back and forth and the power-ups coming.

593
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:21,018
Scott: I wait for you to try to.

594
00:43:21,401 --> 00:43:23,438
Scott: it's like if you just stay at the bottom I'm ahead on the score.

595
00:43:23,478 --> 00:43:23,639
Scott: I could.

596
00:43:23,659 --> 00:43:33,069
Rym: just I don't have to fight you Where there's like two wizards and they're having a fight and they have like a beam of terrible power Just like crushing into the middle against each other.

597
00:43:33,512 --> 00:43:37,090
Rym: That's what it feels like with two powered up people in a ricochet game by themselves.

598
00:43:37,925 --> 00:43:43,214
Scott: Yeah I love it when there's a wave of discs coming at me like a whole big mess and then I dodge them all with my left Right dodging.

599
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:45,562
Scott: It feels like dodging fireballs from imps and doom.

600
00:43:45,603 --> 00:43:46,586
Scott: It's like the same dodging.

601
00:43:46,727 --> 00:43:47,550
Rym: It is the same dodging.

602
00:43:47,773 --> 00:43:48,645
Rym: Ah, that game is so good.

603
00:43:49,633 --> 00:43:50,337
Rym: Yeah, let's get into it.

604
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:59,670
Rym: We have not talked about this topic since April 3rd 2006. now I want to point out we call you run out of Monday ideas.

605
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:09,104
Scott: Send your Monday ideas via any of the DMS but because our show is so old as 15 years old We can redo show ideas now and it'll actually be somewhat fresh now.

606
00:44:09,284 --> 00:44:11,010
Scott: also you have to resort to at this point.

607
00:44:11,171 --> 00:44:11,353
Scott: so

608
00:44:11,475 --> 00:44:12,566
Rym: this one in particular, uh

609
00:44:13,791 --> 00:44:14,374
Scott: The news

610
00:44:14,514 --> 00:44:33,082
Rym: on this day was that Microsoft virtual server started supporting Linux and also When we Recorded that episode of GeekNights on that Monday We mostly explained in the show the difference between CRTs and LCDs and at the time I was still using a 21 inch CRT

611
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:35,791
Scott: Plus.

612
00:44:35,831 --> 00:44:38,280
Scott: CRT is still even today have some advantages over.

613
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:42,373
Rym: you want a really really high refresh rate Even the best.

614
00:44:42,514 --> 00:44:43,296
Scott: Yeah, even the best.

615
00:44:43,416 --> 00:44:51,286
Scott: Oh LED, you know LCD displays are still not as You know good in some ways as a CRT is.

616
00:44:51,326 --> 00:44:52,753
Rym: yeah Do you want?

617
00:44:52,914 --> 00:44:56,529
Rym: it's a really good zero latency and an extremely high refresh rate a CRT.

618
00:44:56,650 --> 00:45:02,310
Scott: So that's why you still you still see like, you know, Smash Brothers players, right using the CRT, right?

619
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:04,085
Scott: Cuz you know, it's what you gotta do.

620
00:45:05,191 --> 00:45:06,955
Rym: But that changed a lot.

621
00:45:06,996 --> 00:45:09,401
Rym: smart TVs appeared ink appeared.

622
00:45:09,642 --> 00:45:10,925
Rym: There's a whole world.

623
00:45:10,965 --> 00:45:12,990
Rym: I'm looking at two 4k monitors right now.

624
00:45:13,776 --> 00:45:18,690
Scott: Yep OLEDs are a thing We've got you know, and the thing is it's not just monitors, right?

625
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:23,509
Scott: You've got displays on all kinds of devices with all kinds of different properties and things to choose from.

626
00:45:24,673 --> 00:45:26,130
Scott: So it's just like a whole new world.

627
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:31,124
Scott: So I guess I'll start with the most frequently used display by most people which is the television.

628
00:45:31,566 --> 00:45:32,990
Scott: and what's really happened with the television?

629
00:45:33,252 --> 00:45:35,590
Scott: Is you got LCDs but the OLED?

630
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:49,973
Scott: TV is like the king and the thing with an OLED that's different from an LCD is it's sort of the same thing Right, the difference is that an LCD is a screen with pixels and the pixels change color and the light is a light That's separate.

631
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:52,123
Scott: that shines through from the back and then haha.

632
00:45:52,164 --> 00:45:53,450
Scott: You can see the colors in the pixel.

633
00:45:53,470 --> 00:46:03,492
Rym: Yeah, and the pixels do like crystals basically move to change the polarization But exact they're only modifying the light that's coming through from that backlight Exactly.

634
00:46:03,532 --> 00:46:15,870
Scott: So the early LCD screens would have like a couple lights usually like at the bottom and top like light bulbs and They would die or they would dim or you'd have some parts of the screen being brighter than others and they had all problems.

635
00:46:16,292 --> 00:46:28,494
Scott: now when you see someone saying like you've got an LED TV an LED TV is just an LCD with a grid of LEDs behind the LCD screen to light it evenly With lower power.

636
00:46:28,836 --> 00:46:29,839
Scott: It's a thinner screen.

637
00:46:29,899 --> 00:46:33,530
Scott: It's better, but it's just better lights than just light bulbs, right?

638
00:46:34,671 --> 00:46:36,236
Scott: So then came along the OLED.

639
00:46:36,256 --> 00:46:40,890
Scott: so the OLED is an organic LED and what this is is really unbelievable.

640
00:46:41,718 --> 00:46:44,834
Scott: each pixel has its self-illuminating right.

641
00:46:44,874 --> 00:46:55,205
Scott: the pixels light themselves up and what this means is that the contrast ratio on an OLED screen is Unbelievable because a black pixel is fucking black.

642
00:46:55,265 --> 00:46:57,935
Scott: it turns its light off Right and you can't see.

643
00:46:57,955 --> 00:47:03,005
Scott: it's like so the dip on a screen has a light shining behind it at all times Right.

644
00:47:03,973 --> 00:47:11,309
Scott: Even the black pixels are still kind of gray because there's light shining through them Right and it can't block all the light with like a like a lead shield.

645
00:47:12,898 --> 00:47:14,050
Scott: It's just a crystal whatever.

646
00:47:15,311 --> 00:47:19,525
Scott: So an OLED screen the difference between the lit up parts and the dark parts.

647
00:47:19,605 --> 00:47:21,190
Scott: The contrast ratio is so high.

648
00:47:21,332 --> 00:47:22,629
Scott: It's really really beautiful.

649
00:47:23,932 --> 00:47:27,955
Scott: But the problem with LED screens is they are Expensive.

650
00:47:28,015 --> 00:47:29,442
Scott: they cost a lot even today.

651
00:47:29,462 --> 00:47:30,930
Scott: They cost a lot of fucking money.

652
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:37,415
Scott: And the reason they cost so much money is because when they try to make them at the factory The yields are low.

653
00:47:37,516 --> 00:47:43,921
Scott: and what that means is when the factory spits out five screens or whatever some number of screens maybe ten screens.

654
00:47:44,689 --> 00:47:49,970
Scott: a Percentage of those screens do not pass QA like they're busted or the pixels are messed up.

655
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:56,110
Scott: They're not good enough to actually sell to anybody and they have to recycle them or try again or throw them out or whatever.

656
00:47:56,632 --> 00:48:03,443
Scott: So when you buy a working OLED screen with all its pixels in good shape You're paying for a bunch of broken ones as well.

657
00:48:03,523 --> 00:48:04,569
Scott: And that's where all your money went.

658
00:48:06,332 --> 00:48:06,915
Scott: So that's a thing.

659
00:48:07,338 --> 00:48:07,499
Rym: Yep.

660
00:48:07,982 --> 00:48:09,350
Rym: And now we've also on top of that.

661
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:11,197
Rym: we've got the dig at a 1080p or a 4k now TVs.

662
00:48:11,257 --> 00:48:19,608
Rym: a 4k TV is really not useful to people.

663
00:48:19,869 --> 00:48:30,010
Scott: yet Unless there are you have any Yep, and you're using it as a PC And you might be watching those 4k programs a lot, right.

664
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:37,250
Scott: So if the things you're watching a lot happen to be in 4k a lot Maybe you've got you know, you're you're just super super movie person.

665
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:47,762
Scott: You're buying those ultra boo rays that have 4k movies or you the sports you're watching or like NFL broadcasts are in 4k or something Right, then, you know Super Bowl is probably available in 4k - right.

666
00:48:47,802 --> 00:48:49,870
Scott: then maybe maybe you should get it, right?

667
00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:55,229
Scott: The HD PC obviously can do 4k but like I don't think the newest consoles the ps5 doesn't do 4k.

668
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:56,875
Scott: I don't think right does it?

669
00:48:57,437 --> 00:48:58,079
Rym: I don't think so.

670
00:48:58,139 --> 00:49:01,802
Rym: No, I mean most people don't even run their computers at 4k even if they can.

671
00:49:03,152 --> 00:49:05,618
Scott: PS 5 4k resolution guide.

672
00:49:05,678 --> 00:49:06,119
Scott: Let's see.

673
00:49:06,661 --> 00:49:09,548
Scott: It seems like it can do it to some extent.

674
00:49:09,588 --> 00:49:10,470
Scott: but how many games?

675
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:17,069
Rym: Yeah, how many games even if it's outputting 4k or I feel like it's upscaling as opposed to rendering in 4k.

676
00:49:18,437 --> 00:49:25,119
Rym: Just a change I Watch on my computer with my 4k monitor.

677
00:49:25,159 --> 00:49:26,622
Rym: I'm actually rendering in 4k.

678
00:49:26,642 --> 00:49:27,545
Rym: Yep.

679
00:49:27,585 --> 00:49:33,618
Scott: The the ps5 does support 4k 120 Hertz video output.

680
00:49:34,691 --> 00:49:47,610
Scott: So if you guess if you got a ps5 ps5 then maybe a 4k TV is a good idea Maybe maybe all right, it supports it to some extent and I wonder I bet it can play those fancy boo rays the upgrade ultra.

681
00:49:49,134 --> 00:49:54,330
Scott: Not that I would ever buy a physical media ever again in my life, but it probably can play those I'm guessing.

682
00:49:55,491 --> 00:50:02,640
Scott: See the final thing with TVs that's happened since 2006 is pretty much the smart TV has come to dominate And this is a problem.

683
00:50:03,143 --> 00:50:04,070
Scott: This is bad, right?

684
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:10,949
Scott: so you want to go and buy a TV and like us you have no intention of using any of that smart TV bullshit.

685
00:50:10,969 --> 00:50:16,082
Scott: because Hey if you let the smart TV connect to the internet, right?

686
00:50:16,423 --> 00:50:18,890
Scott: You're just asking for a world of problems, right?

687
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:25,990
Scott: this is a thing that has happened is because The software that you're basically I've seen a lot of smart TVs are bases Android phones in the TV.

688
00:50:26,572 --> 00:50:31,830
Scott: That's what they are a lot of them and that software is never getting updated and it's easily exploited.

689
00:50:32,372 --> 00:50:36,764
Scott: So your TV which eventually stops getting updates eventually gets hacked.

690
00:50:36,845 --> 00:50:46,190
Scott: and now you've got a TV in your house to spamming Emails to someone who knows what it's doing malwaring Attacking using up your bandwidth that is limited by Comcast, right?

691
00:50:46,450 --> 00:50:47,670
Scott: Who knows what the hell that thing's doing?

692
00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:55,063
Scott: And also the functionality of even the best smart TVs with the best UIs is Basically crap compared to even things.

693
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:56,049
Scott: I don't like like the Roku.

694
00:50:56,351 --> 00:51:00,890
Rym: Yeah, the UI tend to be really unresponsive like even on fancy expensive OLED TVs.

695
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:04,366
Rym: You'd be surprised how slowly they respond to commands.

696
00:51:04,908 --> 00:51:07,661
Scott: Yeah I mean if you've got the ps5, what do you you know?

697
00:51:07,681 --> 00:51:09,690
Scott: or a HD PC or Roku or anything?

698
00:51:10,530 --> 00:51:24,210
Scott: Chromecast and Apple TV all of those even though HD PC is the one true master, whatever the best one of all those the The the smart TV loses to everything.

699
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:26,557
Rym: well like the apps a lot of times the apps will just like.

700
00:51:26,918 --> 00:51:34,421
Rym: I remember way back when people were using the Netflix apps that were Built-in to or the YouTube apps in particular that were built into their TVs.

701
00:51:34,882 --> 00:51:37,490
Rym: those YouTube apps would like one now block ads.

702
00:51:37,952 --> 00:51:41,687
Rym: Two didn't really like work the way YouTube normally works.

703
00:51:41,828 --> 00:51:50,710
Rym: and three Certain videos that were flagged with certain monetization settings would not show up Like you could not watch them because that was not treated like just a browser.

704
00:51:52,372 --> 00:52:02,213
Rym: All sorts of nonsense would happen and that's on top of all these security concerns and the inability to like update them Or even to understand in some cases what they're doing Yep.

705
00:52:02,595 --> 00:52:04,950
Scott: So the problem is you want to buy a TV that's not smart.

706
00:52:05,131 --> 00:52:06,416
Scott: There aren't a lot to choose from.

707
00:52:06,436 --> 00:52:10,010
Scott: there are some but not many and they're not necessarily the best displays.

708
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:17,390
Scott: so what you can do is either a You can buy a smart TV and just not plug it into the internet and not use any of the smart stuff.

709
00:52:17,490 --> 00:52:20,990
Scott: Just use it as a screen and try to ignore the smart part as much as possible.

710
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:23,199
Scott: Yeah smart part in quotes.

711
00:52:23,219 --> 00:52:24,224
Scott: or you can buy.

712
00:52:24,244 --> 00:52:27,816
Scott: there are people selling Large monitors, right?

713
00:52:27,836 --> 00:52:32,248
Scott: So they're computer monitors that are just large like Alienware has like a 55 inch monitor.

714
00:52:32,288 --> 00:52:32,509
Scott: That's 4k.

715
00:52:33,011 --> 00:52:35,449
Scott: That's actually pretty impressive looking monitor.

716
00:52:37,151 --> 00:52:40,842
Scott: But you know, it has some limitations mostly the price.

717
00:52:40,963 --> 00:52:46,170
Scott: it's real expensive, but it does look pretty nice I gotta say even if you're not gaming or whatever.

718
00:52:46,331 --> 00:52:55,983
Scott: So there are some options out there for giant monitor or dumb TV But I think for reasonable in terms of saving money you have.

719
00:52:56,063 --> 00:52:59,453
Scott: I think the option today that's available is just Smart TV.

720
00:52:59,633 --> 00:53:01,378
Scott: turn off all the smart stuff as much as possible.

721
00:53:01,418 --> 00:53:04,347
Scott: Don't plug it in just power in HDMI and that's it.

722
00:53:04,728 --> 00:53:22,163
Rym: Yep and As much as I want a dumb TV like a TV that just doesn't do anything fancy I feel like that ship is sailing right now because what's driving these smart TVs like when you really think about it Is that TVs are really commoditized to most people.

723
00:53:22,223 --> 00:53:23,687
Rym: they just want a TV that works.

724
00:53:24,108 --> 00:53:27,366
Rym: when they buy one It's not like they're gonna replace it until it breaks.

725
00:53:27,447 --> 00:53:31,907
Scott: in most cases Until they the bigger one they get enough money to buy a bigger one.

726
00:53:31,928 --> 00:53:37,089
Rym: because yeah But once you get a big enough TV, you can get a gigantic TV real cheap if you get like an old LCD.

727
00:53:38,172 --> 00:53:38,618
Scott: There's a whole.

728
00:53:38,638 --> 00:53:44,250
Scott: there's still a whole Culture of people who are just like oh look at my new big TV is like a dick measuring contest, right?

729
00:53:44,551 --> 00:53:49,669
Rym: Yeah, but I think that ran out when you can for like 400 bucks literally get like a 72-inch TV and just like.

730
00:53:49,870 --> 00:53:52,227
Scott: well I think there are actually a lot of people buying like.

731
00:53:52,247 --> 00:53:58,170
Scott: there are People who don't like cuz you know, you're not bragging to your friends like ha ha it's you know.

732
00:53:58,190 --> 00:54:00,397
Scott: They don't understand if you're not tech people, right?

733
00:54:00,558 --> 00:54:05,478
Scott: Oh, it's OLED high contrast ratio HDR, but 77 inches.

734
00:54:05,519 --> 00:54:06,606
Scott: so there's a lot of TVs out there.

735
00:54:06,626 --> 00:54:09,050
Rym: I don't know I was in high school.

736
00:54:09,171 --> 00:54:10,858
Rym: I remember people wouldn't like.

737
00:54:11,139 --> 00:54:19,781
Rym: there was an error where people were talk about my big TV but once Flat panels started appearing they talked more about the technology.

738
00:54:19,841 --> 00:54:23,351
Rym: like the people who had a plasma TV would never shut up about their plasma TV.

739
00:54:23,372 --> 00:54:24,295
Scott: that's true.

740
00:54:24,415 --> 00:54:30,130
Scott: Anyway, even if they were saying outputting SD like plasma plasma is dead, by the way plasma, alright.

741
00:54:33,027 --> 00:54:35,397
Scott: So, yeah That's the deal with TVs.

742
00:54:35,538 --> 00:54:36,442
Scott: So what our monitors?

743
00:54:36,583 --> 00:54:36,744
Scott: right.

744
00:54:36,764 --> 00:54:37,467
Scott: so monitors.

745
00:54:37,527 --> 00:54:39,777
Scott: these days They got 4k monitors out there.

746
00:54:39,797 --> 00:54:42,207
Scott: The best monitor you can buy is the Apple monitor.

747
00:54:42,407 --> 00:54:43,030
Scott: It's unbelievable.

748
00:54:43,553 --> 00:54:46,310
Scott: It only works with Apple things and it costs a million that zillion dollars.

749
00:54:47,252 --> 00:54:50,710
Scott: So don't buy it unless you win the lottery yesterday and you have Apple computers.

750
00:54:51,051 --> 00:54:53,419
Scott: Yeah, pretty much but it's really smart.

751
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:56,430
Scott: Like remember I was talking about how they were like lights behind the LCD screen.

752
00:54:56,832 --> 00:55:03,117
Scott: It has a grid of lights and it dims and brightens them Dynamically as the images on the screen change.

753
00:55:03,698 --> 00:55:04,561
Scott: no other screen.

754
00:55:04,701 --> 00:55:07,388
Scott: I'm aware of for consumers does that it's.

755
00:55:07,588 --> 00:55:08,210
Scott: it's ridiculous.

756
00:55:09,151 --> 00:55:11,801
Scott: So you're not an Apple person who has a million dollars.

757
00:55:11,861 --> 00:55:13,467
Scott: what monitor are you gonna buy now?

758
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:19,510
Rym: I think normal computer usage if you use a work like that like laptops just have a monitor like whatever.

759
00:55:19,611 --> 00:55:28,290
Rym: But if you're buying a desktop monitor You pretty much want to get a 4k unless you have a specific reason not to in the model the case.

760
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:30,580
Scott: So there's a few things that have developed right?

761
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,789
Scott: So you've got the 4k versus the not HD.

762
00:55:33,010 --> 00:55:37,770
Scott: There's even some 2k monitors out there with your higher resolution than 1080p, but you know what?

763
00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:41,110
Scott: Most monitors now, it's really hard to get an aspect ratio.

764
00:55:41,191 --> 00:55:43,990
Rym: That's not 16 by 9 which I'm mad about but you know what?

765
00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:48,345
Rym: I had to let that sail like as much as I honestly my whole life have since it appeared.

766
00:55:48,365 --> 00:55:50,151
Rym: if preferred 16 by 10.

767
00:55:50,151 --> 00:55:53,223
Rym: I still think it's a better form factor for what I do with computers.

768
00:55:53,926 --> 00:55:54,528
Rym: I ship sailed.

769
00:55:54,608 --> 00:55:55,311
Rym: I gave up I can't.

770
00:55:55,331 --> 00:55:55,934
Rym: there's no way.

771
00:55:55,934 --> 00:55:58,444
Rym: 16 by 10 still exists, but they're expensive and no one.

772
00:55:58,725 --> 00:56:00,010
Scott: Yeah, no one's making them really.

773
00:56:00,694 --> 00:56:02,010
Scott: So here's the things you have to worry about.

774
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:05,003
Scott: The first thing you had to worry about is yeah, do you need that higher resolution?

775
00:56:05,164 --> 00:56:06,570
Scott: and is your computer strong enough?

776
00:56:07,461 --> 00:56:09,689
Rym: People do not have a computer that can drive 4k.

777
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:19,366
Rym: In fact, if you don't I have a dedicated GPU your computer probably cannot display at 4k Without either really lowering the refresh rate.

778
00:56:19,386 --> 00:56:25,405
Scott: I have a 1070. the 1070 can have two 4k monitors and then it is at its absolute limit.

779
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:27,170
Scott: I cannot add a single extra pixel.

780
00:56:27,290 --> 00:56:32,087
Scott: I couldn't have 2k to 4k monitors and a 640 by 480 monitor.

781
00:56:32,107 --> 00:56:32,689
Scott: That wouldn't work.

782
00:56:33,871 --> 00:56:34,172
Scott: It's like.

783
00:56:34,192 --> 00:56:36,419
Scott: that's the limit of pixels it can render it once.

784
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:41,375
Rym: if you're a gamer and you put your games to be in 4k They will look beautiful.

785
00:56:41,696 --> 00:56:46,058
Rym: However, they use Massive amounts of GPU.

786
00:56:46,078 --> 00:56:50,095
Rym: power like 4k is four times 1080p.

787
00:56:50,135 --> 00:56:51,442
Scott: that's like having it you.

788
00:56:51,502 --> 00:56:52,990
Scott: it's four times as many pixels.

789
00:56:53,130 --> 00:56:59,090
Scott: So if you were running at 1080p 80 frames a second, you're probably going down closer to 20.

790
00:56:59,090 --> 00:57:00,716
Scott: So I'll give you an example.

791
00:57:00,956 --> 00:57:05,350
Rym: my current computer my like super beast with its 1080 and like all the nonsense in it my workstation.

792
00:57:05,732 --> 00:57:09,447
Rym: When I played overwatch before I got a 4k monitor, I rendered it at 1080p.

793
00:57:10,733 --> 00:57:11,980
Rym: It was just locked at 120 FPS all the time.

794
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:18,161
Rym: Perfect Didn't even like get hot like the GPU was like barely.

795
00:57:18,361 --> 00:57:19,605
Rym: I like barely above idle.

796
00:57:20,107 --> 00:57:24,431
Rym: when I got the 4k monitor My GPU is running like at 80%.

797
00:57:24,431 --> 00:57:28,927
Rym: The room gets hot all the fans spin up and I'm locked at 60 FPS.

798
00:57:31,486 --> 00:57:33,678
Rym: But It is so.

799
00:57:33,999 --> 00:57:37,190
Rym: I remember you came over right after I'd gotten those monitors.

800
00:57:37,210 --> 00:57:44,039
Rym: We were into auto chess and you were like we were talking about auto chess and I started playing and you were like Why does it look so good on your computer?

801
00:57:44,059 --> 00:57:44,963
Rym: And you were like really real.

802
00:57:45,023 --> 00:57:50,418
Scott: and then you realized oh 4k Yeah Yeah monitors matter a lot more than graphic.

803
00:57:50,458 --> 00:57:51,381
Scott: Okay, so that's the first thing.

804
00:57:51,422 --> 00:57:52,144
Scott: resolution right.

805
00:57:52,184 --> 00:57:53,890
Scott: next thing colors, right?

806
00:57:53,990 --> 00:57:59,335
Scott: So if you're doing Photoshop II video type work print type work You're an artist of some kind.

807
00:57:59,797 --> 00:58:03,170
Scott: you need a monitor with accurate color display, right?

808
00:58:03,290 --> 00:58:08,748
Scott: You'd be surprised you could take the same JPEG in the same app with the same settings like clean windows.

809
00:58:08,789 --> 00:58:13,030
Scott: install Right and open that JPEG on two different monitors same computer, right?

810
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:16,770
Scott: Just drag the the the window back and forth between the monitors, right?

811
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:30,630
Scott: And you'll see the colors change completely because one monitor is better has a higher Range of colors it can display in the gamut and It's just better at color accuracy or is more well calibrated or whatever.

812
00:58:31,232 --> 00:58:34,761
Scott: So if it matters to you, then you need to.

813
00:58:34,801 --> 00:58:38,130
Scott: the monitors that have extreme color accuracy cost a lot of money.

814
00:58:38,171 --> 00:58:40,996
Scott: It's basically three tiers Generally speaking.

815
00:58:41,016 --> 00:58:48,344
Scott: Yeah, there's ridiculous accuracy, which is like 100% s RGB plus even like Adobe and that's all.

816
00:58:48,404 --> 00:58:51,654
Rym: I can use one of those peripherals to Calibrate it like.

817
00:58:51,835 --> 00:58:57,474
Scott: after these monitors cost thousands of dollars that use them that we would use them at like Pixar or something I don't even you guys.

818
00:58:57,956 --> 00:59:00,386
Scott: yeah, I don't you need that then is like the $500 monitor range.

819
00:59:01,610 --> 00:59:02,694
Scott: This is what I'm talking about.

820
00:59:02,734 --> 00:59:05,806
Rym: The Dell ultra sharp is a good example of that range, right?

821
00:59:05,846 --> 00:59:09,275
Rym: We're talking $500 99% s RGB.

822
00:59:09,416 --> 00:59:13,670
Scott: almost everything you see on your desktop computer is s RGB color.

823
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:20,546
Scott: You know Scheme gamut, whatever right so you can see 99% of the colors very accurately.

824
00:59:21,008 --> 00:59:21,690
Scott: It's gonna be great.

825
00:59:22,032 --> 00:59:30,050
Scott: Then you've got don't care about colors monitors Which are the all those ones that you see a new egg or whatever during Black Friday, which is coming up, right?

826
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:31,114
Scott: It's like oh my god.

827
00:59:31,134 --> 00:59:34,066
Scott: What a deal on a monitor 100 bucks 27 inches.

828
00:59:34,086 --> 00:59:34,890
Scott: I'm getting this.

829
00:59:35,251 --> 00:59:36,336
Scott: Yeah, cuz the colors on it.

830
00:59:36,376 --> 00:59:37,461
Scott: They just don't give a shit right?

831
00:59:37,481 --> 00:59:39,089
Scott: you who knows what you're seeing on there.

832
00:59:40,172 --> 00:59:41,298
Scott: So those are your color things.

833
00:59:41,358 --> 00:59:43,107
Scott: Okay, something else important.

834
00:59:43,128 --> 00:59:46,007
Scott: these days I have learned every the details about this, right?

835
00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:49,465
Scott: G-sync free sync, right?

836
00:59:49,747 --> 00:59:52,664
Scott: Oh, yeah What is the deal with that?

837
00:59:52,805 --> 00:59:53,589
Scott: So here's the deal?

838
00:59:54,510 --> 01:00:03,276
Scott: You and the olden days right would have a game and the game would run at X FPS and your monitor can only render So many frames a second.

839
01:00:03,316 --> 01:00:04,482
Scott: It's a 60 Hertz monitor.

840
01:00:04,502 --> 01:00:05,567
Scott: It's a 144 Hertz monitor, right?

841
01:00:06,290 --> 01:00:08,670
Scott: You obviously if you're gaming higher Hertz is better, right?

842
01:00:08,770 --> 01:00:14,277
Scott: Because if you're no point in rendering 100 FPS if you only got a 60 Hertz monitor You're throwing away 40 frames never to be seen.

843
01:00:14,457 --> 01:00:16,684
Rym: Yep gamers will make a weird argument.

844
01:00:16,865 --> 01:00:18,450
Rym: That is pretty much nonsense.

845
01:00:18,811 --> 01:00:20,135
Scott: So right if you.

846
01:00:20,155 --> 01:00:25,010
Scott: but hey, you can buy 144 Hertz monitor now by even more than that, right?

847
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:33,369
Scott: Yeah, I can't run 4k at 144 Hertz just saying But someone who's got a 3080 maybe 3080s probably could right who knows?

848
01:00:34,571 --> 01:00:36,378
Scott: But yeah, if you've got the power you can do it.

849
01:00:37,001 --> 01:00:37,343
Scott: Damn.

850
01:00:37,423 --> 01:00:38,086
Scott: That's some stuff.

851
01:00:38,146 --> 01:00:38,869
Scott: But here's the problem.

852
01:00:40,031 --> 01:00:41,117
Scott: They're used as a setting.

853
01:00:41,258 --> 01:00:43,630
Scott: every pretty much every video game has a setting vertical sync.

854
01:00:43,951 --> 01:00:44,713
Scott: What does that mean?

855
01:00:45,114 --> 01:00:46,840
Scott: That means when you set vertical sync.

856
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:48,224
Scott: you're telling the GPU.

857
01:00:48,465 --> 01:00:50,050
Scott: Hey, my monitor is 60 Hertz.

858
01:00:50,611 --> 01:00:54,724
Scott: I want you to render 60 frames and we're gonna be in sync with each other.

859
01:00:54,804 --> 01:00:55,466
Scott: render a frame.

860
01:00:55,586 --> 01:00:56,108
Scott: show the frame.

861
01:00:56,368 --> 01:00:56,890
Scott: render a frame.

862
01:00:57,171 --> 01:00:57,692
Scott: Show the frame.

863
01:00:57,953 --> 01:00:58,475
Scott: render a frame.

864
01:00:58,575 --> 01:00:59,057
Scott: show the frame.

865
01:00:59,899 --> 01:01:13,599
Scott: if you don't set that setting what can happen is something I saw as recently as Star Squadrons, which is sort of the screen tearing effect where the computer is drawn half the the current frame to the screen and it's about halfway through.

866
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:28,789
Scott: so it's in the middle of the screen drawing pixels and suddenly the next frame gets swapped in the frame buffer and So frame one is on the top half of the screen in frame two is in the bottom half of the screen and they don't Line up and you see sort of this horizontal line across the screen and it's sort of awkward.

867
01:01:30,350 --> 01:01:32,721
Scott: So the way we solved that was vertical sync.

868
01:01:32,781 --> 01:01:34,910
Scott: right render the frames on time with each other.

869
01:01:36,131 --> 01:01:37,697
Scott: What the hell is G sync then?

870
01:01:37,757 --> 01:01:39,624
Scott: if we have vertical sync, right?

871
01:01:39,965 --> 01:01:41,350
Scott: Why the hell do you need G sync?

872
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:44,919
Scott: Well, what if you can't render 60 FPS?

873
01:01:44,959 --> 01:01:47,987
Scott: What if you've got 144 Hertz monitor, but you can't render 144 frames?

874
01:01:49,471 --> 01:01:58,821
Scott: What if you can do more than 144 frame, you know, whatever what this does is it basically says hey, you know GPU You're gonna render all the frames you can right.

875
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:01,150
Scott: just you know, don't care about what the monitors doing.

876
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:11,082
Scott: Don't try to stay in sync with the monitor and the monitor is gonna display the frames properly in sync Right so that that effect doesn't happen.

877
01:02:11,323 --> 01:02:13,410
Scott: Every frame is gonna start at the top and end at the bottom.

878
01:02:14,450 --> 01:02:24,509
Scott: so NVIDIA just to not go into extreme detail NVIDIA does this in a very fancy way with lots of extra fancy features that are really kind of nice.

879
01:02:25,512 --> 01:02:37,946
Scott: But it does it by having an actual CPU in the monitor to do the extra work and that's why G sync monitors are expensive Because they have extra hardware in the monitor to gain these extra features that are kind of nice.

880
01:02:37,986 --> 01:02:40,257
Scott: if you can afford them The free sync.

881
01:02:40,518 --> 01:02:42,167
Scott: what Nvidia AMD does?

882
01:02:42,267 --> 01:02:42,730
Scott: free sync?

883
01:02:43,890 --> 01:02:46,259
Scott: Free sync has less features than G sync.

884
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:49,010
Scott: It is not as high spec.

885
01:02:49,111 --> 01:02:49,594
Scott: Yeah, right.

886
01:02:49,816 --> 01:02:51,810
Scott: It doesn't do all the fancy things.

887
01:02:51,930 --> 01:02:53,916
Scott: It just does the basics of synchronizing.

888
01:02:54,398 --> 01:02:58,530
Scott: but the monitors are less expensive because they don't need that fancy extra CPU in the monitor.

889
01:02:59,571 --> 01:03:05,913
Scott: So you can just get a free sync monitor and get most of the benefits, but not all the benefits You can.

890
01:03:05,953 --> 01:03:10,850
Scott: however, you'll see some G sync compatible monitors, which are usually free sync monitors.

891
01:03:11,232 --> 01:03:15,730
Scott: So you got an NVIDIA GPU, but you got an AMD free sync monitor.

892
01:03:16,132 --> 01:03:20,670
Scott: You can get the benefits of the AMD one because the NVIDIA one sort of encompasses all that and more.

893
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:23,379
Scott: You're just sort of telling the NVIDIA GPU.

894
01:03:23,399 --> 01:03:26,189
Scott: Hey, don't do the extra stuff because the monitor doesn't have the CPU in it.

895
01:03:27,612 --> 01:03:33,688
Scott: so that's what that's what that is, it's only important if you're gaming and Such and you got extra money for the monitor.

896
01:03:34,332 --> 01:03:38,270
Rym: Yep, and I do not have that because I actually got my monitors a while ago when I built the new computer.

897
01:03:38,910 --> 01:03:46,566
Scott: My my plan actually is when I eventually do get new monitors whenever the hell that is could be a year from now You've got one of my old monitors.

898
01:03:46,626 --> 01:03:50,670
Scott: right now I'm gonna get one monitor that doesn't care about frame rate.

899
01:03:50,690 --> 01:03:55,990
Scott: That's all about color right like a $500 color fancy monitor and then a second monitor.

900
01:03:56,050 --> 01:03:59,110
Scott: That's the gaming monitor with the free sync G sync, right?

901
01:03:59,530 --> 01:04:08,165
Scott: You know not maybe not caring about color so much getting the high frame rates 144 or more And hopefully both of them will be 4k and that'll be the limit of my GPU

902
01:04:08,185 --> 01:04:13,790
Rym: now for me in terms of screen size I actually 27 inches feels like the sweet spot for like desktop like the kind of work.

903
01:04:13,790 --> 01:04:20,690
Scott: 27 I think is the C 24 but I have 16 by 10. if it's 27 then it could be 16 by 9.

904
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:23,683
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know, but bigger than that.

905
01:04:23,743 --> 01:04:25,450
Scott: It's like that's a television that doesn't go on.

906
01:04:25,550 --> 01:04:27,644
Scott: I see people who got these televisions on their desk.

907
01:04:27,684 --> 01:04:28,690
Scott: It's like no, what are you doing?

908
01:04:29,050 --> 01:04:30,676
Scott: Yeah, that is that is not.

909
01:04:30,877 --> 01:04:34,190
Scott: that is not right unless you've got eye problems or some other reason that makes sense.

910
01:04:34,563 --> 01:04:47,324
Rym: Yeah now one thing I think about too is one of the real benefits of 4k on the desktop like when you go to 4k outside of gaming where if you don't Have a great GPU you can still tell your games to render in 1080p.

911
01:04:47,364 --> 01:04:48,448
Rym: That's what I do for Star Wars.

912
01:04:48,529 --> 01:04:49,775
Scott: actually Yep.

913
01:04:49,816 --> 01:04:50,137
Scott: Yep.

914
01:04:50,198 --> 01:04:51,224
Scott: I do that for some games.

915
01:04:51,244 --> 01:04:51,365
Scott: Yeah.

916
01:04:51,486 --> 01:04:59,969
Rym: Yep, but Texts will be surprisingly legible at very small physical sizes with a 4k monitor.

917
01:05:01,872 --> 01:05:08,515
Rym: That is the thing you might not realize that you might think oh my text will all be tiny but it'll be Crystal-clear when it's tiny.

918
01:05:08,536 --> 01:05:21,590
Rym: Yep and windows at least like it used to not work that great But like high resolution monitors used to have used to have a lot of problems on Windows But that's pretty much all gone now and you can set the scaling factor in Windows.

919
01:05:21,610 --> 01:05:31,290
Rym: a lot of people don't think to do this and you can set it to like a hundred and twenty five or a hundred and Fifty percent where you still want your computer to output to your monitor at its native resolution.

920
01:05:31,793 --> 01:05:32,658
Rym: Very rarely.

921
01:05:32,678 --> 01:05:34,670
Rym: Do you want to output at any other resolution?

922
01:05:35,150 --> 01:05:40,370
Rym: You can theoretically do like a perfect half or quarter, but that's not an ideal solution.

923
01:05:40,390 --> 01:05:54,941
Rym: You're better off always sending data to your monitor at its native resolution so 3840 by like 2160 and then tell Windows to scale up all the like Interface stuff by 50%.

924
01:05:54,941 --> 01:05:56,186
Rym: so text will be a little bit.

925
01:05:56,347 --> 01:05:58,716
Scott: Alright, you know My resolution is twice as high.

926
01:05:58,776 --> 01:06:00,261
Scott: make my icons twice as big.

927
01:06:00,322 --> 01:06:02,610
Scott: make my text font my text size twice as big.

928
01:06:02,711 --> 01:06:05,150
Scott: I just mean it's like oh and now everything looks great.

929
01:06:06,332 --> 01:06:08,683
Rym: Yeah, and that really just comes down to how are your eyes?

930
01:06:08,724 --> 01:06:09,910
Rym: How are you using the computer?

931
01:06:10,371 --> 01:06:14,706
Rym: I've seen some people that they have the big TV monitor because they sit pretty far away from it.

932
01:06:14,746 --> 01:06:15,849
Rym: the way they've set up their desk.

933
01:06:17,271 --> 01:06:18,241
Scott: Mmm, that could work.

934
01:06:18,423 --> 01:06:23,704
Rym: Yeah Of the Dell ultra sharp like U2718Q.

935
01:06:23,744 --> 01:06:29,124
Scott: if you want a cheap pretty color I do like them because this applies to the TVs and the monitors.

936
01:06:29,184 --> 01:06:30,910
Scott: just how many connectors are on there, right?

937
01:06:30,950 --> 01:06:31,955
Scott: It's like if you're not a nerd.

938
01:06:31,995 --> 01:06:32,920
Scott: you probably don't care you just need.

939
01:06:33,081 --> 01:06:34,810
Rym: Oh, yeah, we should talk about this really briefly.

940
01:06:34,932 --> 01:06:35,968
Rym: I think we talked about it before.

941
01:06:36,652 --> 01:06:38,499
Rym: Modern TVs still just HDMI.

942
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:38,900
Rym: That's it.

943
01:06:39,362 --> 01:06:41,490
Rym: But monitors take display port.

944
01:06:42,391 --> 01:06:43,615
Rym: Uh a lot.

945
01:06:43,675 --> 01:06:46,784
Rym: do not buy generic display port cables for reasons.

946
01:06:46,824 --> 01:06:47,547
Rym: I don't want to get into.

947
01:06:47,607 --> 01:06:48,329
Rym: you can google it.

948
01:06:49,651 --> 01:06:56,697
Rym: most display port cables, especially if they're generic or cheap will have Wires in them that are not supposed to be there.

949
01:06:56,757 --> 01:07:08,887
Rym: that will literally fry either your GPU or your monitor or both possibly Mmm, like just go read about display port cables and do not buy like Amazon generic or whatever.

950
01:07:08,947 --> 01:07:09,649
Rym: you'll have a problem.

951
01:07:11,391 --> 01:07:18,717
Scott: Okay, I wanted to talk about displays and like phones tablets and that We'll talk about a little bit I guess because we're going long.

952
01:07:18,737 --> 01:07:25,090
Scott: but basically yeah most of the phones these days have you know The same sort of thing that's going on with monitors.

953
01:07:25,130 --> 01:07:27,010
Scott: They're like really high resolution screens.

954
01:07:27,070 --> 01:07:31,930
Scott: A lot of all the best ones are oleds because even those those oleds are expensive on the tv side.

955
01:07:32,271 --> 01:07:37,174
Scott: They're still expensive on the phone side, but they're so much smaller that you know And they can make more.

956
01:07:37,295 --> 01:07:38,781
Scott: it seems to make a smaller one, right?

957
01:07:39,363 --> 01:07:40,729
Scott: It doesn't cost as much as a giant one.

958
01:07:41,851 --> 01:07:46,666
Scott: Uh, it's like, you know, this new iphone has like a you know, super amazing oled screen in it.

959
01:07:46,746 --> 01:07:47,629
Scott: It's like unbelievable.

960
01:07:47,749 --> 01:07:55,030
Scott: Yeah Uh, some of the android phones have super high refresh rate screens like some of those samsung galaxy ones and that's pretty nice, too.

961
01:07:55,130 --> 01:07:59,897
Scott: I think the iphone refresh rate is actually maybe the one area It's still behind in terms of.

962
01:08:00,399 --> 01:08:01,403
Scott: I guess they didn't feel the need.

963
01:08:01,423 --> 01:08:02,970
Scott: they're like, yeah, they were like why I don't know.

964
01:08:03,130 --> 01:08:06,850
Rym: I mean i'm good with like a 720p cell phone because maybe it saves battery.

965
01:08:07,332 --> 01:08:10,547
Scott: Yeah, maybe it's yeah, maybe it saves battery to have a lower refresh rate on the screen.

966
01:08:10,567 --> 01:08:12,581
Scott: I don't know Uh, but yeah, those are.

967
01:08:12,702 --> 01:08:13,709
Scott: that's what's going on there.

968
01:08:14,512 --> 01:08:20,470
Scott: It's still oleds regular leds that sort of thing, you know, it's the same technology that we were just talking about only smaller.

969
01:08:21,594 --> 01:08:34,609
Scott: Uh, there are all sorts of other display technologies like e-ink Yeah, like e-inks and those sorts of things, uh, you know old ips screens these older technologies They've been around a long time but miniaturization has happened.

970
01:08:35,011 --> 01:08:38,563
Scott: So you see a lot in the hacking modding communities like.

971
01:08:38,582 --> 01:08:52,970
Scott: you can buy now an e-ink display Of many varieties to go with a raspberry pi and it's like any shape size Sets of colors different properties, so, you know, there's like so many choices at reasonable prices.

972
01:08:53,732 --> 01:08:58,064
Scott: Uh, there are ips screens like old, you know, like tiny lcd's.

973
01:08:58,124 --> 01:09:00,250
Scott: I put one in my gameboy advance, right?

974
01:09:00,370 --> 01:09:02,502
Scott: It's unbelievable this screen that you can put in there.

975
01:09:02,522 --> 01:09:02,563
Scott: Um.

976
01:09:04,151 --> 01:09:10,500
Scott: So for handheld portable devices like the kinds of screens you can just buy a screen like to mod into your project.

977
01:09:10,761 --> 01:09:13,752
Scott: the choices now are really Like you're.

978
01:09:13,832 --> 01:09:19,849
Scott: you're basically getting like best possible monitor from 10 years ago in a really tiny tiny space.

979
01:09:19,910 --> 01:09:22,828
Scott: now Uh, like choose your resolution choose your size.

980
01:09:23,551 --> 01:09:27,281
Scott: It low power right super bright super nice colors.

981
01:09:27,321 --> 01:09:34,389
Scott: They might not be accurate colors, but they'll be nice looking Right, uh way better than what else you're going to get at that size.

982
01:09:35,032 --> 01:09:44,390
Scott: So it's just there's a lot of activity going on in that realm even though that's not The highest end realm of displays that people think about the most which is you know televisions monitors.

983
01:09:44,872 --> 01:09:48,029
Scott: There's still a lot of activity happening in the tiny display zone.

984
01:09:48,992 --> 01:09:52,149
Scott: Uh in terms of using older technologies better smaller.

985
01:09:52,169 --> 01:09:58,489
Rym: Yep I still think there's a lot of cool uses for e-ink that are just around the corner because it uses so little power.

986
01:09:59,491 --> 01:10:03,287
Scott: Yep, because it only refreshes we need to refresh it and they've got some that are like partial refresh.

987
01:10:03,307 --> 01:10:07,246
Scott: where you're like Okay, you've got you're reading an e-book reader, right?

988
01:10:07,488 --> 01:10:10,229
Scott: It's like okay You've got your words here and the top left is a clock.

989
01:10:10,742 --> 01:10:11,612
Scott: So, okay We need to read.

990
01:10:11,713 --> 01:10:15,890
Scott: we're not going to redraw the screen every second or every minute because the clock is on the screen.

991
01:10:15,950 --> 01:10:19,068
Scott: We'll just refresh the tiny part of the screen that has the clock on it.

992
01:10:19,209 --> 01:10:23,229
Scott: only All right, and then if you turn the page, okay, we'll refresh the whole screen now, right?

993
01:10:23,890 --> 01:10:25,423
Scott: And save a lot of power that way.

994
01:10:25,484 --> 01:10:26,230
Scott: It's it's real nice.

995
01:10:27,341 --> 01:10:40,763
Rym: um Yeah, but the cool thing is if you're in the market to buy a new monitor at least Uh, if you don't need something very specific and fancy you can get Real good 4k monitors for pretty cheap.

996
01:10:40,864 --> 01:10:49,881
Rym: Like they're not going to be super color correct They might only have a 60 fp like a frame refresh rate 60 hertz But they're way better than an lcd.

997
01:10:49,901 --> 01:10:51,770
Rym: you would have gotten even five six years ago.

998
01:10:51,971 --> 01:10:55,264
Scott: Yeah, I remember the one thing I forgot to talk about that.

999
01:10:55,345 --> 01:10:55,786
Scott: we can end this.

1000
01:10:55,867 --> 01:10:56,825
Scott: we can end on this All right.

1001
01:10:56,890 --> 01:11:00,264
Scott: There's a couple trends that are going on in monitor realm that we haven't talked about.

1002
01:11:00,305 --> 01:11:02,753
Scott: the first trend is the curved Display trend.

1003
01:11:02,894 --> 01:11:08,170
Rym: I am theoretically a fan of that but every curved display i've seen is a really low resolution screen.

1004
01:11:09,051 --> 01:11:09,512
Scott: I agree.

1005
01:11:09,652 --> 01:11:16,655
Scott: I've used i've seen curved resolution displays, especially at packs as like demo machines and The curve.

1006
01:11:16,776 --> 01:11:19,250
Scott: it's like you think it's a gimmick, but it's actually kind of nice.

1007
01:11:19,410 --> 01:11:25,149
Rym: It's real nice if your monitor's big like 27 inch or bigger like that's real nice Like there's something to it.

1008
01:11:25,250 --> 01:11:30,158
Scott: Like it's like you sit in front of the curved screen and it's like, you know It doesn't feel like awkward at all.

1009
01:11:30,218 --> 01:11:31,503
Scott: It just it's like it.

1010
01:11:31,543 --> 01:11:38,559
Scott: actually, you know, it's sort of like easier It just I don't know if there's like a science behind it But it's sort of one of those things where it's like.

1011
01:11:38,620 --> 01:11:39,824
Scott: it could just be bs.

1012
01:11:39,884 --> 01:11:46,006
Scott: It could just be psychological Where it's like, oh, yes, my split keyboard in my dvorak layout is better.

1013
01:11:46,107 --> 01:11:46,890
Scott: It feels better.

1014
01:11:47,031 --> 01:11:47,858
Scott: I can't explain it.

1015
01:11:47,899 --> 01:11:49,190
Scott: There's no science behind it, right?

1016
01:11:49,550 --> 01:11:51,216
Scott: the curved monitor is the same way.

1017
01:11:51,276 --> 01:12:00,750
Scott: where it's like it just feels nice like you stand in front of them and it just like Feels nice the way like a nicer carpet just feels nicer than a rough carpet, right?

1018
01:12:00,930 --> 01:12:01,695
Scott: You know, there's something there.

1019
01:12:02,017 --> 01:12:15,690
Scott: the second trend that's going on in monitor land Is the combined monitors right where you'll get a display that is mega big like instead of being 1920 by 1080 What's 1920 times 2 like 4000?

1020
01:12:15,690 --> 01:12:17,812
Rym: Yeah, but it's not like two separate monitors It's just it.

1021
01:12:17,852 --> 01:12:20,929
Rym: basically like you're almost outputting two different monitors to one physical device.

1022
01:12:21,471 --> 01:12:31,450
Scott: Some sometimes you do have to plug in like two hdmi cables, but it's basically one big ass screen or One package that has secretly two screens in it.

1023
01:12:31,530 --> 01:12:34,923
Scott: But in the middle, they're just right next to each other literally next to each other.

1024
01:12:34,984 --> 01:12:40,904
Scott: So it might as well be one Extra wide screen or sometimes even extra tall.

1025
01:12:40,984 --> 01:12:46,584
Scott: i've seen screens where it's like, yeah It's extra big but you're actually splitting up this one.

1026
01:12:46,804 --> 01:12:51,196
Scott: What looks to you to be one Screen Splitting it up four ways.

1027
01:12:51,457 --> 01:12:54,109
Scott: plug in four hdmi cables and show four different things.

1028
01:12:54,612 --> 01:13:00,577
Scott: Rather than buying four monitors you buy one giant monitor and show four things on it Like a video wall almost.

1029
01:13:00,617 --> 01:13:00,838
Rym: Yep.

1030
01:13:01,239 --> 01:13:11,150
Rym: Now on one hand I can see a time and a place for that kind of thing but most of the ones i've seen are also Actually either pretty low resolution or have a lot of weird drawbacks.

1031
01:13:11,592 --> 01:13:17,418
Rym: The other problem is if you don't live somewhere where you can have a big spacious desk That might not fit anywhere.

1032
01:13:17,438 --> 01:13:19,869
Rym: like I could not put a monitor like that on this desk.

1033
01:13:20,752 --> 01:13:23,530
Scott: Well, it's like and also just my personal workflow, right?

1034
01:13:23,650 --> 01:13:28,258
Scott: Having one even if I could just combine both of my monitors into one monitor That was I guess what I have.

1035
01:13:28,258 --> 01:13:28,560
Scott: 1920 by 1200 now time.

1036
01:13:29,890 --> 01:13:36,956
Rym: Well, like if it's one big monitor and you tell a game to go full screen a lot of games do not have that aspect Ratio and there's all sorts of fuck-ups that happen.

1037
01:13:37,377 --> 01:13:41,850
Rym: or they're playing on counter strike on like half of a monitor and that just feels weird.

1038
01:13:42,812 --> 01:13:43,497
Scott: Yeah, so 3840 by 1200 it's like.

1039
01:13:45,873 --> 01:13:53,310
Scott: It's like that's actually worse for me to combine these two screens Like I keep something on the right and something on the left and they're separated, right?

1040
01:13:53,510 --> 01:14:02,470
Scott: So putting them in one screen the major benefit is really a few Applications like games that will spread their way across right?

1041
01:14:02,570 --> 01:14:04,142
Scott: It's like star wars could be pretty good.

1042
01:14:04,162 --> 01:14:08,350
Scott: if you're not doing vr And you do it on the big wide screen that could be pretty nice, right?

1043
01:14:08,471 --> 01:14:09,557
Scott: It's extra wide.

1044
01:14:09,577 --> 01:14:12,010
Scott: you see a lot to the left a lot to the right, you know.

1045
01:14:12,090 --> 01:14:18,550
Scott: Maybe an fps could be really nice if it spreads its way across both screens like that, but so few applications do that.

1046
01:14:19,074 --> 01:14:33,130
Scott: It's like it makes a really good demo But I think it's only a good purchase if you are frequent like your game is a game Like like your your life is focused on a game and that game supports that or something, right?

1047
01:14:33,511 --> 01:14:41,050
Scott: Or you primarily most of the time use an application that supports that giant wide screen, you know one application across both, right?

1048
01:14:41,811 --> 01:14:47,390
Scott: If you're doing two screens with one application left one on the right don't buy the big wide, you know mega screen.

1049
01:14:47,471 --> 01:14:48,827
Scott: It's kind of silly, right?

1050
01:14:49,510 --> 01:14:50,193
Scott: Yep, but it is.

1051
01:14:50,294 --> 01:14:54,290
Scott: it is a thing and it exists and it has uses but you make sacrifices in other areas.

1052
01:14:54,935 --> 01:14:58,224
Scott: Uh for that at least right now And that's that.

1053
01:14:58,407 --> 01:15:01,135
Scott: so 2020 screen update.

1054
01:15:01,316 --> 01:15:01,537
Rym: Yep.

1055
01:15:01,657 --> 01:15:04,810
Rym: And if you want to listen to what this was like in 2006, i'll link to that episode.

1056
01:15:04,890 --> 01:15:09,670
Rym: You'll hear us talk a lot about crts versus these newfangled early lcd.

1057
01:15:11,051 --> 01:15:13,539
Scott: All right, so we're allowed to do this show again in 2034.

1058
01:15:13,539 --> 01:15:17,009
Rym: All right, hopefully by then it's either just like.

1059
01:15:17,050 --> 01:15:19,579
Rym: well I've got the i-implant and oh I got the.

1060
01:15:19,759 --> 01:15:22,810
Rym: I got the synchronized i-implant, but I got the asynchronous one.

1061
01:15:23,652 --> 01:15:25,514
Scott: I'm waiting for i-implant 2.0.

1062
01:15:25,514 --> 01:15:34,480
Rym: At least This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
