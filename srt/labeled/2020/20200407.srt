1
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,541
Rym: It's Tuesday April 7th 2020.

2
00:00:12,541 --> 00:00:15,209
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:15,229 --> 00:00:18,723
Rym: tonight We are talking about Animal Crossing New Horizons.

4
00:00:19,145 --> 00:00:26,570
Rym: Let's do this So it's finally warm enough to get outside and that is really helping my sanity during the whole quarantine.

5
00:00:27,673 --> 00:00:29,947
Scott: Yeah, this problem is is even though I can go outside.

6
00:00:29,968 --> 00:00:33,941
Scott: I work I have to stay inside until 5 still.

7
00:00:34,021 --> 00:00:41,899
Scott: so what I'm doing the whole thing is I wanted to work from home So that I could just do whatever the hell I wanted to The monkey spa.

8
00:00:41,919 --> 00:00:43,104
Rym: monkey spa just curled.

9
00:00:43,144 --> 00:00:44,269
Rym: now you get to work from home.

10
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:47,349
Scott: Yeah, but I can't do whatever I want while I'm working from home.

11
00:00:48,491 --> 00:00:53,145
Scott: I wanted to like, you know, wake up and bike until like, you know noon.

12
00:00:53,206 --> 00:00:55,694
Scott: come home do a little work Maybe see.

13
00:00:55,715 --> 00:00:57,422
Rym: the problem is you didn't want to work from home.

14
00:00:57,723 --> 00:00:59,410
Rym: You just wanted to not work.

15
00:01:00,153 --> 00:01:11,510
Scott: Yeah But I could still do the amount of work that I do if I go to the office Eight hours, I wanted to do the same total hours of actual work and of all the other times spent doing something else.

16
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:20,810
Scott: Like for example, if I was legit working from home, right the good the way I wanted I could go out to lunch at us at a restaurant with service.

17
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:26,993
Rym: Yeah, of course, I can't just go to the baroness and get a burger if I want but you can't sit there and eat it During lunch.

18
00:01:27,094 --> 00:01:27,315
Scott: Nope.

19
00:01:27,396 --> 00:01:28,422
Rym: I gotta go back to my home.

20
00:01:28,443 --> 00:01:32,676
Rym: Yeah But what I'm doing now is everyone.

21
00:01:32,696 --> 00:01:41,576
Scott: I wanted to bring up a laptop to the park or the beach and be like Well, I'm doing I'm available to work But nope can't do that.

22
00:01:41,817 --> 00:01:45,630
Rym: Yeah, I think I'm gonna start sitting with my laptop on the balcony doing work at least occasionally.

23
00:01:46,213 --> 00:01:49,669
Scott: Yes, I can do that as long as the Sun is in the right position to not burn me.

24
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:56,530
Rym: Nah, but my plan now is every day if I'm during lunch I'm actually gonna go outside and go for a run or a bike first and then eat lunch.

25
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:08,398
Scott: Mmm, so say like for example today the meeting I had a meeting at 10 and a meeting at 1 So I had not enough time really To get my shit together between them.

26
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:11,410
Rym: Don't you doctor, you know, my job is mostly meetings.

27
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:17,310
Rym: Half of my job is literally just talking to people repeatedly and then having meetings with like my five meetings all day.

28
00:02:18,251 --> 00:02:28,327
Rym: Mmm, luckily all the nerds I can just use instant messaging or you'd like to do the meetings and not actually have to talk out Because a lot of my good engineers they would much rather just instant message me.

29
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:37,747
Rym: then Actually, like get into a video call and talk for a half-hour But all the business side things it's got to be like video chat face-to-face ten people in the room.

30
00:02:37,788 --> 00:02:38,129
Rym: Let's go.

31
00:02:40,683 --> 00:02:53,620
Rym: So there is a bunch of news, but since there's no Sports happening right now Like normally this time of year is when we're starting to talk about NHL playoffs and like the Rangers Like are they gonna make the wild card, but we got nothing.

32
00:02:54,103 --> 00:02:56,539
Rym: So I'm actually watching a lot more eSports instead.

33
00:02:57,681 --> 00:03:00,631
Rym: Okay, cuz overwatch league is still going still trucking on.

34
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:03,340
Scott: Oh, yeah, the only sport that's not canceled the eSports.

35
00:03:03,923 --> 00:03:05,973
Rym: So the thing about overwatch league is the.

36
00:03:06,073 --> 00:03:12,699
Rym: I like watching eSports tournaments But I very rarely watch them live because I don't care that much who wins.

37
00:03:13,362 --> 00:03:17,520
Scott: So usually I'll either watch highlight reels or like you want New York to end as a New York.

38
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,600
Rym: I mean, I do want New York to win and Excelsior always they're still like very good in the league.

39
00:03:21,881 --> 00:03:25,574
Rym: Excelsior is a solid team to be a fan of but most of the other games.

40
00:03:25,615 --> 00:03:28,800
Rym: I don't care that much or The game might not be exciting.

41
00:03:29,221 --> 00:03:30,385
Rym: Sometimes they are sometimes they aren't.

42
00:03:30,425 --> 00:03:38,300
Rym: so I tend to just wait for the VODs and I'll either watch highlight reels or I'll watch Like the game everyone was talking about from the previous day on YouTube.

43
00:03:38,883 --> 00:03:41,999
Scott: That is a problem and I think a lot of eSports is that there is.

44
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:47,988
Scott: you know professional sporting leagues tend to have Often more parody.

45
00:03:48,008 --> 00:03:48,812
Scott: Yeah.

46
00:03:48,912 --> 00:03:58,891
Scott: Yeah, you know even in NHL It's like well teams that are clearly better than the other team will only beat the crappy team not a hundred percent of the time But maybe like 70% of the time, right?

47
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:07,006
Scott: Except the red wings right now Right, but in a lot of eSports, you know You watch say like a fighting game tournament.

48
00:04:07,348 --> 00:04:10,360
Scott: towards the end of the tournament you get parody you get excitement, right?

49
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,504
Scott: Those early rounds.

50
00:04:11,524 --> 00:04:11,865
Scott: Oof.

51
00:04:12,046 --> 00:04:20,055
Scott: It's just like yeah, like watch the York play say Boston in overwatch Watch like Sonic Fox play against whoever it gets paired up with in round one.

52
00:04:20,076 --> 00:04:20,517
Scott: Yeah, like boom

53
00:04:22,924 --> 00:04:36,660
Rym: I'm thinking if you remember one must fall 2097 when you get the news commentator talking about the fight you just had and if you utterly Fucking crushed your opponent the commentator was like if you wanted to see a fair test of skill tonight was not your night.

54
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:42,620
Rym: However, if you were looking for a masochistic pounding have we got highlights for you, right?

55
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:47,295
Scott: You know usually other pro sports that have like opens like say US Open of golf.

56
00:04:47,315 --> 00:04:54,000
Rym: You don't really see the Yeah, cameras not a direct in the last person, right?

57
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,376
Scott: You never see the guy who hits it into the trees 20 times up captain Joe plus 20, right?

58
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:03,280
Rym: They're following like Tiger Woods plus one or minus two or wherever they are something.

59
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,716
Scott: Well US Open is pretty hard even for the best people.

60
00:05:05,797 --> 00:05:09,299
Scott: Yeah, but But like even in f1 there was a super aguri.

61
00:05:10,201 --> 00:05:12,491
Scott: That's right, you know, but you but you don't see.

62
00:05:12,551 --> 00:05:14,520
Scott: they don't keep the camera on the super aguri.

63
00:05:14,621 --> 00:05:15,469
Scott: You can just watch.

64
00:05:15,651 --> 00:05:16,540
Rym: you check in with them.

65
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:20,716
Scott: You know Mercedes is in the Ferraris and whoever's up front you can just keep your eyes on them.

66
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,613
Scott: the Red Bulls Whoever is now this year is the good car.

67
00:05:23,794 --> 00:05:26,588
Rym: I don't need to watch Uprising lose but I get.

68
00:05:26,668 --> 00:05:29,661
Rym: I like someone to check in and tell me that they lost Right.

69
00:05:30,082 --> 00:05:33,411
Scott: So it's like when you're watching even NFL football was a less parody.

70
00:05:33,912 --> 00:05:34,153
Scott: right.

71
00:05:34,393 --> 00:05:41,514
Scott: when there's a game that's like Cleveland Browns Versus so-and-so you just don't watch that game because there's so many simultaneous games.

72
00:05:41,815 --> 00:05:43,340
Scott: They got the red zone, right?

73
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:49,840
Rym: So you're always watching something, you know good Yep, so I think this when the other problem is Overwatch League is global.

74
00:05:50,001 --> 00:06:03,887
Rym: so like the games are on weekends like Saturday and Sunday mostly but Some of the matches I want to watch or at like 4 a.m And the matches I don't give a shit about are like 6 when I would normally watch like I don't want to watch Houston and Like I just don't care.

75
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,698
Rym: so I'm gonna.

76
00:06:05,718 --> 00:06:13,720
Rym: I'm gonna Try to watch some more live games But probably not this weekend because there's no live games during my time zone that I care that much about.

77
00:06:14,362 --> 00:06:18,440
Scott: Yeah, most of what we've been watching eSports wise is linked to the past randomizer.

78
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:21,239
Scott: There was a tournament and we watched the tournament, which is great.

79
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:29,600
Scott: But now there's a league that's going on and the league has a lot Let like I just said less parody than the late rounds of the tournament which are super legit.

80
00:06:30,222 --> 00:06:34,498
Scott: The league has a lot of you know, some teams are just better than others, right?

81
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:39,317
Scott: Yeah It's just like complete blowouts and it's not exciting close races.

82
00:06:39,438 --> 00:06:41,996
Scott: Like the Tournament was towards the end there.

83
00:06:43,062 --> 00:06:49,160
Rym: Yeah, I mean with these niche sports like when you get to randomizers that is already a subculture of a subculture of a subculture.

84
00:06:49,723 --> 00:06:54,906
Scott: Yet the number of people watching those things is shocking Like it's really a link to the past.

85
00:06:54,946 --> 00:06:57,575
Scott: randomizer community is shockingly large.

86
00:06:57,635 --> 00:07:12,284
Scott: like they put together this league I think the teams are three or four people I don't know three or four people each and there's a ton of teams and Every even minor races have like hundreds or perhaps even like a thousand viewers Right.

87
00:07:12,305 --> 00:07:14,240
Scott: It's way more popular than bringing GeekNights.

88
00:07:15,108 --> 00:07:18,192
Rym: Yeah Girl, we serve a very specific audience.

89
00:07:18,233 --> 00:07:20,340
Rym: The listener appreciates us Sure.

90
00:07:21,123 --> 00:07:31,219
Rym: So in some other news one a lot of you like I didn't even notice this News about cooking mama at first because the few tweets I knew it but the few tweets I saw about it.

91
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:39,040
Rym: We're so obviously not true that I ignored it as like a ridiculous conspiracy bullshit thing, but it hit getting talked about.

92
00:07:39,622 --> 00:07:43,500
Scott: Oh, yeah, so I saw this news in the beginning because it was in the Nintendo switch community.

93
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,523
Scott: Yeah, I shouldn't sorry.

94
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:53,040
Scott: and then basically people were saying hey this cooking mama came came out and that's a semi popular Second tier maybe third tier franchise.

95
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,003
Scott: that was really one of those like.

96
00:07:54,024 --> 00:08:04,833
Scott: there's a lot of these game franchises that were big on the DS or Nintendo mobile platforms We're that we're sort of like big in the small pond, right?

97
00:08:04,913 --> 00:08:06,599
Rym: Yeah, like brain age was that?

98
00:08:07,302 --> 00:08:09,550
Scott: Well, I mean, that's a Nintendo first party title.

99
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:12,360
Scott: I'm talking about like your golden sons, right?

100
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,936
Rym: Oh, I forgot about golden son the nine door nine, whatever nine something's.

101
00:08:17,478 --> 00:08:22,040
Scott: there's like Actually a whole bunch of third-party games, you know Phoenix, right?

102
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:28,052
Scott: I guess falls in that category to write these things that were really popular on Mobile Nintendo platforms.

103
00:08:28,093 --> 00:08:30,204
Scott: they weren't on Consoles are right.

104
00:08:30,284 --> 00:08:31,227
Scott: It was just in there.

105
00:08:31,267 --> 00:08:35,580
Scott: But now that switches everything all those games are mixed up in the switch.

106
00:08:35,821 --> 00:08:36,402
Scott: Yeah, right.

107
00:08:36,422 --> 00:08:36,964
Scott: So the new.

108
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:45,988
Scott: then if there are new games in those franchises suddenly they have the visibility Outside the the mobile realm.

109
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:57,270
Scott: and for anyone who hasn't like the Nintendo portable Gameboy You know D at GBA DS, right 3ds That is like this great.

110
00:08:57,812 --> 00:09:02,860
Scott: I think still underrated underappreciated treasure trove of amazing games.

111
00:09:03,642 --> 00:09:22,473
Scott: It's like this enormous library a lot of shovelware, but also a lot of amazing games that I think is really Underappreciated not talked about not cared about But anyway, so cooking mama was a pretty big game on the DS and a pretty nothing game to anyone Who wasn't paying attention to DS?

112
00:09:22,493 --> 00:09:26,828
Rym: Yep And it's not having a game but it's like.

113
00:09:26,848 --> 00:09:29,658
Rym: I know style like I see the appeal of this kind of game.

114
00:09:29,698 --> 00:09:31,280
Rym: It was popular right.

115
00:09:32,681 --> 00:09:37,916
Scott: so it was a new one that came out on the switch and It was even in stores.

116
00:09:38,016 --> 00:09:39,701
Scott: cartridges in stores, right.

117
00:09:39,962 --> 00:09:42,229
Scott: and then suddenly it was removed from the e-shop.

118
00:09:42,369 --> 00:09:48,056
Rym: now We do not mysteriously as a dateline know Actually why it was removed.

119
00:09:48,538 --> 00:09:51,770
Rym: like we do not know that there have been some compete conflicting.

120
00:09:52,211 --> 00:10:00,497
Rym: It sounds like it's a dispute between the developers and the publisher and or Nintendo like we don't know Mm-hmm.

121
00:10:01,164 --> 00:10:01,609
Scott: But anyway.

122
00:10:02,513 --> 00:10:08,478
Scott: So imagine it instantly disappeared from the e-shop Right shortly after release.

123
00:10:08,558 --> 00:10:14,210
Scott: people still have cartridges and they can play it but now people like whoa Hold on to that cartridge because it might be valuable.

124
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,875
Scott: It's gonna be some rare game right.

125
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:27,254
Rym: but then some some people started just tweeting this ridiculous rumor that it was removed because it was mining bitcoins on your switch and then Switch.

126
00:10:27,516 --> 00:10:30,370
Rym: and I saw the baby and the baby looked at me, right?

127
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:34,070
Scott: So there are two reasons that I immediately knew that that was bullshit, right?

128
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:40,850
Scott: number one Obviously if you had a game that was mining bitcoins or cryptocurrency on a switch that it would get pulled from the store.

129
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:52,070
Rym: However, number one Nintendo switches are weak sauce CPU wise Yeah, the days he could mine a Bitcoin on a CPU as opposed to a dedicated nightmare machine.

130
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:57,810
Scott: Oh, it has a GPU but technically and I guess you have it if you can infect enough of them.

131
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:01,761
Scott: But how many people are buying cooking mama, even if that's true, right?

132
00:11:01,842 --> 00:11:04,610
Scott: It's like and then it's end of the battery would just die.

133
00:11:05,191 --> 00:11:06,813
Scott: It's like it's a weak sauce thing.

134
00:11:06,853 --> 00:11:08,395
Scott: That's not a good idea.

135
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:20,190
Scott: and to every game that comes out on Nintendo switch is Thoroughly thoroughly thoroughly reviewed by Nintendo like if you got some malware onto the switch.

136
00:11:20,371 --> 00:11:28,887
Scott: Officially like my head is off to you Nintendo doesn't fuck around Yeah, so it's like you think it's hard to get your app into like the Apple App Store.

137
00:11:28,927 --> 00:11:30,733
Scott: It's like no no no no Right.

138
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:35,813
Scott: Nintendo is like it's completely examining every inch of your source Software.

139
00:11:35,853 --> 00:11:40,390
Rym: the vector is in is implausible, but the the result is also implausible.

140
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:43,520
Rym: But it would be impossible to mine bitcoins on a Nintendo switch.

141
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:54,407
Scott: You could do a very small amount of mining Yeah, and if you got enough switches together Maybe you could mine a coin and so anyway, but the point is that was a bullshit story.

142
00:11:54,447 --> 00:12:02,570
Rym: I could tell from the start Yep, and then all these reports like the so-called reports of like switches being bricked by the game literally all came from like one tweet.

143
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:08,056
Scott: Well, it does seem to be true At least more likely to be true.

144
00:12:08,076 --> 00:12:14,437
Scott: I don't know this confirmed that the game is just poorly coded in unity in general Right.

145
00:12:14,802 --> 00:12:25,472
Scott: Yeah Like that it was put together by like some you know first-time Dev team that didn't have mad skills and so the game is poorly coded and Inefficient.

146
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:30,670
Scott: so your switch will heat up and it'll use a lot of CPU and drop frames, and you know it's not well done.

147
00:12:30,931 --> 00:12:36,214
Rym: Yeah, but there are a lot of games that have similar problems like that is not really evident of anything obviously.

148
00:12:36,536 --> 00:12:53,180
Scott: so it somebody's claiming to be a Anonymous developer on the game or working at the developer Or perhaps a reporter possibly making up a source possibly having a real source Yeah, has told the story.

149
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,290
Scott: that is much more plausible, right?

150
00:12:55,470 --> 00:13:27,876
Scott: So we'll take it as truth for the time being that there was a battle between the publisher and developer Right in the in the legal realm right and that is why the game has been pulled and there's some Shenanigans going on business wise which is totally what you would expect From that sort of thing yeah, and that's why this game has disappeared from the e-shop But it remains true that as it was a game and a somewhat significant known franchise that was in the e-shop and pulled and their cartridges out there and Hard to get.

151
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:35,663
Scott: so I would recommend Getting a cartridge wouldn't be If you got one hold on is probably not awful.

152
00:13:35,743 --> 00:13:37,270
Scott: cookie mom is like I fun.

153
00:13:37,431 --> 00:13:40,748
Scott: I can't imagine how bad a new cookie mama game could be if you play it.

154
00:13:41,452 --> 00:13:44,008
Scott: If you don't play it and put it in the closet, you know.

155
00:13:44,732 --> 00:14:01,460
Rym: So another another component of where this rumor seems to have come from is This talk about a company that was involved in the creation of the game Saying like that company was also involved not in cryptocurrency, but in blockchain Which is a generic ledger technology.

156
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,730
Rym: Bitcoin just happens to use a blockchain.

157
00:14:03,871 --> 00:14:06,079
Rym: There are other ways to use blockchain now.

158
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:06,460
Scott: Also.

159
00:14:06,501 --> 00:14:07,986
Scott: It seems that that is just messed up.

160
00:14:08,207 --> 00:14:11,215
Scott: I mean like They were just made up.

161
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:14,850
Scott: yeah, but full disclosure they're not actually doing any blockchain anything.

162
00:14:15,131 --> 00:14:19,750
Rym: Well, there were a bunch of companies trying to get investors.

163
00:14:19,851 --> 00:14:27,610
Rym: I'm not saying this happened here But I've been privy to a lot of VC pitches and I saw a lot of this in other games in the industry.

164
00:14:28,151 --> 00:14:45,910
Rym: People would basically to try to get idiots who want to invest in Bitcoin to invest in like a game studio or a publisher would Try to incorporate blockchain technology in some reasonably plausible feasible way Just so they can say that it is pushing the frontier of blockchain.

165
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:50,730
Scott: I think it's more like and there are there are people are investing in buzzwords.

166
00:14:50,851 --> 00:14:54,909
Scott: Let's just attach the buzzword to our thing without actually doing whatever the buzzword is.

167
00:14:55,150 --> 00:15:06,967
Rym: The most common thing to do if you did anything was just to use something like blockchain to record Transactions that multiple players have on their own systems without having to necessarily trust those systems.

168
00:15:07,329 --> 00:15:13,990
Rym: for like trading like trading goods Like using it as the back end for item trading in games online like that's it.

169
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:19,167
Scott: It still seems like not the oh, no, it's blockchain is never the right database for anything.

170
00:15:19,187 --> 00:15:20,090
Scott: the World of Warcraft way.

171
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:20,762
Scott: I have a database.

172
00:15:20,823 --> 00:15:33,489
Rym: Yep like I'm not saying that is a reasonable technology to use for these purposes, but it's Plausible enough for to make a case more and more every day.

173
00:15:34,695 --> 00:15:42,741
Scott: I'm starting to believe that pretty much almost all Business, you know, sir software problems.

174
00:15:42,882 --> 00:15:45,270
Rym: Oh you're thinking about that because of a specific threat in our forum.

175
00:15:46,033 --> 00:15:49,910
Scott: No, I'm just saying almost all business software problems in the world.

176
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:59,530
Scott: Whatever your business is right, whatever your problem is if it's an information Problem right that a computer can solve yeah Postgres probably solves it.

177
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:02,323
Scott: You probably don't need to do anything else.

178
00:16:02,383 --> 00:16:03,910
Scott: You don't need any weird anything else.

179
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:04,333
Scott: You know what?

180
00:16:04,374 --> 00:16:06,269
Scott: just well just start with Postgres.

181
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:14,010
Scott: yeah, do as much as you can with Postgres QL and towards solving your problem and Add a programming language on top of it.

182
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:19,390
Scott: You know to get an application running on a server Python or even see it doesn't for anything that can connect to Postgres.

183
00:16:19,992 --> 00:16:21,759
Scott: Right and get those two pieces.

184
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:28,848
Scott: and if you can't solve your problem with those two pieces After putting a lot of effort in then you're allowed to add more pieces.

185
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:32,881
Rym: Yep It's like if you don't know why you need them, you don't need them.

186
00:16:32,981 --> 00:16:43,229
Scott: if you don't know there's almost no information Problem that cannot be solved with a combination of Postgres and any modern programming language running on a server.

187
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:45,523
Scott: Yeah Yeah, you don't need anything else.

188
00:16:45,744 --> 00:16:46,630
Rym: Well, you need a message bus.

189
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:46,991
Rym: I don't know.

190
00:16:47,011 --> 00:16:48,317
Rym: throw like Kafka on top of it.

191
00:16:48,377 --> 00:16:51,670
Scott: done might need that maybe maybe but you could also.

192
00:16:52,292 --> 00:16:56,148
Scott: But you should implement your message bus as just like a fucking Q and JMS.

193
00:16:56,188 --> 00:16:58,017
Scott: you first Right there.

194
00:16:58,037 --> 00:17:00,450
Scott: must you know that Postgres probably has some queuing feature.

195
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:04,904
Rym: I you know built in something postgres a long way since the last time I mess right directly.

196
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:09,488
Scott: don't go using a Kafka until you Figured out that you can't do it directly in Postgres itself.

197
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:17,329
Rym: Yeah Well, I guess we actually we actually have a Kafka at work doing some stuff In terms of enterprise service bus like one of those like big iron like buses.

198
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:20,049
Scott: I'm not saying that other pieces are never to be used.

199
00:17:20,431 --> 00:17:23,361
Scott: Okay, I'm saying that you know, they definitely have.

200
00:17:23,922 --> 00:17:26,109
Scott: there are problems that do need more stuff.

201
00:17:26,411 --> 00:17:39,399
Rym: Yeah, but I have seen that majority not solar Systems like Solr solar to handle amounts of data that could trivially be handled by Literally any other solution right?

202
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:42,610
Scott: For example, you postgres full-text search is pretty damn good.

203
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:43,392
Scott: Oh, right.

204
00:17:43,653 --> 00:17:46,381
Rym: It's also go adding or performance and you might expect.

205
00:17:46,882 --> 00:17:48,968
Scott: Oh, yeah, so don't go adding some kind of.

206
00:17:49,249 --> 00:17:56,430
Scott: you know Lucene's solar elastic search whatever until you've proven that the full-text search in Postgres isn't good.

207
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:56,691
Scott: Yeah,

208
00:17:56,711 --> 00:18:11,706
Rym: you know when I went in an old company when I brought some architecture that I owned from just a database to a Lucene Index that was when we got to the point of trade teeth keeping track of 50 million daily Transactions that were moderately large and wanting to keep six months of them.

209
00:18:12,389 --> 00:18:13,653
Scott: Yep Ridiculous shit.

210
00:18:14,255 --> 00:18:14,777
Scott: Not one day.

211
00:18:15,098 --> 00:18:15,279
Scott: Yep.

212
00:18:15,339 --> 00:18:15,801
Scott: It's Tuesday.

213
00:18:15,841 --> 00:18:18,650
Rym: Yep, but cooking mama is not mining bitcoins.

214
00:18:18,871 --> 00:18:21,117
Scott: Good God, like no, it's definitely not.

215
00:18:21,358 --> 00:18:24,828
Rym: I get more than one source before you spread this crap like.

216
00:18:24,868 --> 00:18:27,270
Rym: seriously I got a brief geek bite.

217
00:18:27,631 --> 00:18:29,698
Rym: If you haven't dusted off slay the spire in a while.

218
00:18:29,758 --> 00:18:34,575
Rym: single-player game available on Steam on switch like pretty much everywhere Except iOS.

219
00:18:34,615 --> 00:18:39,390
Rym: I'm still waiting for it is great on the switch because the user interface is so good.

220
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,576
Rym: It is such a good.

221
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:48,027
Rym: lay in bed and play this game until you fall asleep Like the UX is just perfect or how you manipulate these cards.

222
00:18:48,068 --> 00:18:56,796
Rym: This game is great but What I want a geek bite is that the switch has the new character that was added and all the balance changes that were added The watcher the new character.

223
00:18:56,816 --> 00:19:06,030
Rym: if you even if you think you played slay the spire out I would definitely recommend picking it back up and going through the ascensions with the new character.

224
00:19:06,331 --> 00:19:11,933
Rym: The new character is radically different from the other characters in a really fun ways Mm-hmm.

225
00:19:12,114 --> 00:19:15,966
Rym: The main thing is the character has stances and cards will cards and potions.

226
00:19:16,006 --> 00:19:17,270
Rym: things can put you into stances.

227
00:19:17,691 --> 00:19:19,135
Rym: So you might get into aggressive stance.

228
00:19:19,435 --> 00:19:21,440
Rym: That means you do double damage.

229
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:22,162
Rym: Just full stop.

230
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,127
Rym: You also take double damage.

231
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:27,430
Rym: Oh You can go to a column stance.

232
00:19:27,952 --> 00:19:32,970
Rym: All that does is whenever you exit the column stance you get two more energy right then and there.

233
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:35,950
Rym: So you can like make clever combos.

234
00:19:36,111 --> 00:19:39,710
Rym: It's really like a long play like you'll play this like you'll be fighting a boss.

235
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:48,290
Rym: You do no damage to this boss for like ten rounds setting up your ridiculous combo And then you play one turn that one shots the boss.

236
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:48,571
Rym: Like.

237
00:19:48,591 --> 00:19:51,581
Rym: that's the kind of way that's the kind of style you play with this character.

238
00:19:52,042 --> 00:19:53,186
Rym: It is crazy fun.

239
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:56,530
Scott: Oh So that actually reminds me just very quickly.

240
00:19:56,991 --> 00:20:03,390
Scott: There was a early access game that I played called on steam called curse of the dead gods.

241
00:20:03,691 --> 00:20:07,988
Scott: It is still that I still believe it is early access.

242
00:20:08,008 --> 00:20:11,169
Scott: Let me just verify Yeah, it's early access game.

243
00:20:11,703 --> 00:20:20,810
Scott: And yeah basically What this game is is it's a slay the spire kind of roguelike right where you have the mat the branching map and you choose Where you're going next and each different thing.

244
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:24,690
Scott: You could go to a gold room or an item room or a stats room to choose what kind of right?

245
00:20:25,171 --> 00:20:28,401
Scott: But instead of playing a card game at each spot.

246
00:20:28,962 --> 00:20:34,209
Scott: you play basically sort of a real-time Diablo esque action RPG.

247
00:20:35,613 --> 00:20:36,559
Scott: So it's like you go.

248
00:20:36,901 --> 00:20:37,867
Scott: I'll go to the gold room.

249
00:20:38,008 --> 00:20:38,290
Scott: all right.

250
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:46,170
Scott: Here's a tiny two Diablo rooms And there's a lot of gold in them and also bad guys and it's a little bit more action real time than Diablo.

251
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,814
Scott: But it's still isometric view.

252
00:20:48,476 --> 00:20:52,506
Scott: right you know use your spells and abilities and attacks and whatever.

253
00:20:52,546 --> 00:20:54,130
Scott: you know parrying stuff like that.

254
00:20:55,731 --> 00:20:56,896
Scott: It's very early access.

255
00:20:56,957 --> 00:20:59,990
Scott: the amount of content is you know sparse?

256
00:21:01,392 --> 00:21:03,329
Scott: But it still was pretty fun.

257
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:07,870
Scott: I played it for about an hour, and I'm probably gonna play it again once it gets more content.

258
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:12,590
Scott: It seems there was a major update today at 11 a.m.. Room variations see they're adding.

259
00:21:13,391 --> 00:21:17,306
Rym: One of the reasons why I tend to avoid early access for games that I know I'm gonna like.

260
00:21:17,326 --> 00:21:18,993
Scott: yeah, no no I just wanted to.

261
00:21:19,013 --> 00:21:20,120
Scott: I just you know I like.

262
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:25,085
Scott: I said I put it in I checked it out And I probably won't go back to it until it's done.

263
00:21:25,245 --> 00:21:29,144
Scott: ish right Because I sort of played out the amount of content.

264
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:29,968
Scott: They had very quickly.

265
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:45,704
Rym: So speaking of you know where this is like a prime season to dust off a steam library To play video games that you didn't have time to play like ah we're playing a lot of video games But the industry that is in deep shit right now is the board game industry.

266
00:21:45,965 --> 00:21:51,657
Rym: things are not going well And some of the reasons you can anticipate But some of them you probably can't.

267
00:21:52,019 --> 00:22:05,850
Rym: there were other problems that had happened in this industry like late last year that already put it in a precarious situation, so We're looking at maybe a lot of publishers like slowing down laying people off the project.

268
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:10,048
Scott: I just wonder what it means indirectly for the table because I don't care of.

269
00:22:10,088 --> 00:22:18,103
Scott: if you know I already felt like one of the major problems of the board gaming industry which probably contributed to this was Making way too many games.

270
00:22:18,183 --> 00:22:28,889
Rym: hundred percent I think a lot of which are a lot of the studios that are getting like gonna go down to be perfectly blunt Didn't really have a viable path to success anyway, and we're riding a bubble at best, right?

271
00:22:30,675 --> 00:22:46,970
Scott: So The thing is that I don't care if all those games that weren't any good anyway stop gliding up the market with shovelware inventory Right, but what I do care is oh well if there's not as many game publishers Are there gonna be less gaming cons?

272
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:52,230
Rym: Yeah, or less gaming stores because the gaming stores are also not doing well.

273
00:22:52,511 --> 00:22:54,036
Rym: But now they can't even.

274
00:22:54,076 --> 00:22:57,446
Rym: they can't make money from selling because online that's there's not.

275
00:22:57,467 --> 00:22:58,470
Rym: you can't make enough money with that.

276
00:22:58,891 --> 00:23:03,030
Rym: And they can't make money with the impulse buys because people are playing games in their shops.

277
00:23:04,854 --> 00:23:10,117
Rym: Yep, and you think oh everyone stuck at home everyone stuck at home isolated So very hard to get a board game going.

278
00:23:10,137 --> 00:23:13,730
Rym: people who would normally buy and play a board game are going to tabletop simulator.

279
00:23:14,071 --> 00:23:16,258
Rym: They're going to online implementations of these games.

280
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,465
Rym: They're going to the game like slay the spire.

281
00:23:18,485 --> 00:23:19,769
Rym: They're just playing video games instead.

282
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:22,275
Rym: Yep, two-player games.

283
00:23:22,656 --> 00:23:28,149
Rym: I think are having a minor Renaissance, but there aren't that many two-player games.

284
00:23:29,671 --> 00:23:32,468
Rym: they're sold out everywhere the good two-player games I know of.

285
00:23:32,488 --> 00:23:38,450
Rym: and You're not gonna be able to build and develop a new two-player game because you can't manufacture things in China.

286
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:45,530
Rym: Not just because of the virus and all that situation Not just because of all the supply chain distribution problems coming all the way up to the u.s.

287
00:23:45,811 --> 00:23:50,466
Rym: And everywhere in the world but because of all the tariffs and all the other shit that was going down last year.

288
00:23:50,486 --> 00:23:51,850
Rym: That's still happening.

289
00:23:52,891 --> 00:23:55,359
Scott: Yep, there's also a lot of shenanigans going on.

290
00:23:55,479 --> 00:24:02,984
Scott: with regards to you know, as mode a you know A lot of the though the return policy problems the right.

291
00:24:03,004 --> 00:24:03,386
Scott: this did.

292
00:24:03,406 --> 00:24:05,835
Scott: there have been distributor Situations.

293
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:12,268
Scott: they changed their distributors around FMG had huge cutbacks right on all their products that weren't selling.

294
00:24:12,308 --> 00:24:16,544
Rym: basically The industry was entering a contraction and there was a lot of trouble going down.

295
00:24:16,945 --> 00:24:18,150
Rym: and then this happened.

296
00:24:18,612 --> 00:24:22,329
Scott: So basically what you're gonna see at minimum I think is the board game.

297
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:36,010
Scott: Hobby industry right is gonna retract back to only the successful things Right and you're gonna see a lot less of those like board game shelf with a million games including like obscure ones.

298
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:38,737
Scott: It's gonna be like no there's your Warhammer.

299
00:24:38,757 --> 00:24:39,940
Scott: There's your magic.

300
00:24:40,381 --> 00:24:41,605
Scott: There's your pandemic.

301
00:24:41,645 --> 00:24:42,507
Scott: There's a Dominion.

302
00:24:42,527 --> 00:24:45,232
Scott: is your Right?

303
00:24:45,432 --> 00:24:52,329
Rym: the big boys cuz you might think even if I let's say like the crisis boils down a little bit and all the like.

304
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:56,350
Rym: Fall conventions happen like PAX West and PAX Unplugged for example.

305
00:24:56,893 --> 00:25:04,244
Rym: The problem is right around now is when Expo space and publisher deals and all the things for those conventions would.

306
00:25:04,264 --> 00:25:06,190
Scott: well, it's like you think Gen Con is gonna happen.

307
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,074
Scott: That's a lot earlier.

308
00:25:07,094 --> 00:25:09,041
Rym: Yeah, I don't think Gen Con is gonna happen.

309
00:25:09,543 --> 00:25:10,045
Scott: origins.

310
00:25:10,065 --> 00:25:10,628
Scott: I don't know when.

311
00:25:10,668 --> 00:25:14,745
Rym: that yeah but even the planning for those events is just in October.

312
00:25:14,826 --> 00:25:22,210
Rym: is that gonna happen and Companies that are already in a retraction are not as able to dump their advertising budget on things?

313
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:28,270
Rym: They're probably gonna cannibalize that advertising budget to focus on core properties and monetization and just staying alive.

314
00:25:28,691 --> 00:25:34,290
Rym: So it's gonna be a real rough time for the game like the board game industry as a whole.

315
00:25:35,175 --> 00:25:37,109
Scott: I think it's actually though a good time.

316
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:39,336
Scott: well It's a bad time for a game publisher for

317
00:25:39,797 --> 00:25:40,078
Rym: sure

318
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:47,769
Scott: who is trying to like gather up board games and sorry It's a good time if you're a board game author

319
00:25:48,351 --> 00:25:56,110
Rym: Yep, if you're a core designer like if you're just doing a design if you're doing like that early research You're just you're building something, but you don't have to ship it right away.

320
00:25:56,291 --> 00:26:13,170
Scott: There will be less shovelware clogging up the market Right, and so if you come up with like an actual legit hit big-time game Right, you can go the Kickstarter normal route, you know You're gonna have to get your game printed somewhere that can still print it at a probably a higher price.

321
00:26:13,311 --> 00:26:15,850
Scott: Oh, you're still gonna be able to ship it somehow.

322
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:23,370
Rym: Right, I think you're also gonna see a pivot to companies that are good at taking an existing tabletop game and making an online implementation.

323
00:26:24,032 --> 00:26:25,215
Rym: Your day has come.

324
00:26:26,038 --> 00:26:27,021
Rym: Oh, yeah now is the time.

325
00:26:27,061 --> 00:26:32,812
Rym: like the fact that the root video game is not out yet because they weren't in that much of a rush is Terrible.

326
00:26:32,872 --> 00:26:41,809
Rym: because if if root were online now even just with the original game like the original factions I think it would like be near the top of the steam charts.

327
00:26:42,911 --> 00:26:44,094
Scott: Maybe like that's.

328
00:26:44,475 --> 00:26:47,723
Scott: the people doing that are the same people who did the Y&Y.

329
00:26:47,743 --> 00:26:49,728
Scott: Yeah digital edition, which is good.

330
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:52,417
Scott: It is Yeah, it's I'm looking it up right now.

331
00:26:52,437 --> 00:26:54,042
Rym: I earned something.

332
00:26:54,122 --> 00:26:55,145
Rym: I always lose track of them.

333
00:26:55,627 --> 00:26:56,510
Scott: dire wolf dire wolf.

334
00:26:57,538 --> 00:27:00,863
Scott: Yeah Dire wolf digital right there.

335
00:27:00,923 --> 00:27:09,797
Scott: They did a Sagrada They did eternal echoes of eternity Raiders of the North Sea yellow and yanxi and they're doing the digital root edition And they did a great job.

336
00:27:10,179 --> 00:27:14,373
Scott: if anyone's got yellow and yanxi on steam Let's play.

337
00:27:14,393 --> 00:27:15,378
Rym: Yeah, let's get a game going.

338
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:17,770
Rym: Yeah, I would love to play that together.

339
00:27:18,591 --> 00:27:19,053
Scott: Let's do it.

340
00:27:19,454 --> 00:27:24,729
Rym: All right, and last we'll go brief on this because I want to get talking about Animal Crossing But this is an Animal Crossing news.

341
00:27:25,791 --> 00:27:27,577
Rym: We all know that nobody like zipper.

342
00:27:28,219 --> 00:27:31,830
Scott: zipper the bunny because I only saw him on the first day and then he disappeared.

343
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:33,677
Rym: Yep, he came back because I'm a little.

344
00:27:33,737 --> 00:27:37,170
Rym: Emily joined my island and then he came back so she could talk to her to him.

345
00:27:37,432 --> 00:27:38,646
Scott: oh, I see I see.

346
00:27:38,707 --> 00:27:44,710
Rym: but When I saw zipper, I kind of started because everyone kept saying oh, there's this bunny and I hate it.

347
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:47,841
Rym: But then I saw the bunny that is some five nights at Freddy's.

348
00:27:47,881 --> 00:27:53,076
Rym: shit is clearly in a costume is clearly not a bunny And he's looking at me.

349
00:27:53,116 --> 00:27:53,498
Scott: I think that's.

350
00:27:53,619 --> 00:28:05,644
Rym: I think it's supposed to be that, you know, it's well It's supposed to be like a working person Like it's just a job like this person is wearing this costume and trying their hardest But it's either Tom Nook or someone Tom Nook hired.

351
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:09,689
Rym: Yeah, but in reality It just feels like it's five nights at Freddy's and this thing's gonna murder me.

352
00:28:10,153 --> 00:28:12,230
Scott: He's trying to attract people to the island with his holiday.

353
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:19,250
Rym: Yeah, but the news is that Animal Crossing has the Easter event called Bunny Day in the u.s.

354
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,402
Rym: you know all the events that they do.

355
00:28:20,422 --> 00:28:24,280
Rym: and Nobody liked the egg hunts either.

356
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:32,817
Rym: and people were so mad about it that Nintendo They actually dialed back the egg dropper rates because no one wants to get more eggs They want to find actual fish.

357
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:38,578
Scott: Well, they mostly dialed it back on The sky eggs because they were just too many.

358
00:28:38,598 --> 00:28:39,260
Scott: Yeah, right.

359
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,107
Scott: They were constant like balloons are coming.

360
00:28:41,187 --> 00:28:42,934
Rym: I stopped shooting them down I didn't care anymore.

361
00:28:43,416 --> 00:28:46,330
Scott: Well, I look at the balloon to see if it's a bunny one or a regular one.

362
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,628
Scott: Yeah, if it's a bunny one I ignore it, right?

363
00:28:49,613 --> 00:28:51,110
Scott: But I don't think they dialed them back at the other day.

364
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:56,917
Scott: I think what it is is that the rate that they had makes sense From the standpoint of.

365
00:28:56,937 --> 00:29:03,946
Scott: I've been playing this game for a while and I have all the stuff and I'm sure Need something like oh, I'm gonna craft all the Bunny Day stuff Let's go.

366
00:29:04,552 --> 00:29:05,033
Scott: But it doesn't.

367
00:29:05,053 --> 00:29:07,862
Scott: it doesn't make sense for a game that just came out.

368
00:29:07,922 --> 00:29:10,370
Scott: people are still trying to like build up from nothing.

369
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:13,806
Rym: I'm still trying to get a second room like new players are buying this game by the day, right?

370
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,951
Scott: It's like you're trying to get your you know beginning of game stuff Like.

371
00:29:18,011 --> 00:29:27,530
Scott: I need you know to get all I need to get all the basic common fish and it's like well half the fish you Pull are just water eggs, right and that gets in the way I'm like, what if I started the game today?

372
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:30,081
Rym: Like how am I even gonna like do anything right.

373
00:29:30,403 --> 00:29:32,110
Scott: the other thing it'll be over in five days.

374
00:29:32,752 --> 00:29:42,059
Scott: the thing that really I think for me made the vent less fun is That none of the Bunny Day goods ugly.

375
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:45,067
Scott: It's so ugly and bleh.

376
00:29:45,087 --> 00:29:45,589
Scott: I don't want.

377
00:29:45,609 --> 00:29:49,769
Rym: I was like Cool, and it's just like this bulb is monstrosity.

378
00:29:50,472 --> 00:29:57,514
Scott: Yeah, if any of them were ones I wanted or right then it would be like, oh I need eggs to make the cool Bunny-day, whatever.

379
00:29:57,554 --> 00:30:00,223
Rym: I want the cherry blossom stuff instead, right?

380
00:30:00,243 --> 00:30:02,130
Scott: There actually isn't that much cherry blossom stuff.

381
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:02,873
Scott: It's very few.

382
00:30:02,933 --> 00:30:04,299
Rym: I know but that's the only things I want.

383
00:30:05,062 --> 00:30:06,950
Scott: Yeah, and cherry blossoms go away in three days.

384
00:30:07,595 --> 00:30:08,583
Rym: Oh, I better deal with that.

385
00:30:12,995 --> 00:30:21,900
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

386
00:30:22,361 --> 00:30:31,516
Rym: So, uh, if you watch the wonderful sport of ice hockey one thing and you're not like in ice hockey culture One thing that always stands out to people is oh shit.

387
00:30:31,556 --> 00:30:32,260
Rym: Are they just fighting?

388
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,743
Rym: why isn't anyone stopping them?

389
00:30:33,783 --> 00:30:45,656
Rym: cuz like if someone tries to have a fistfight in like a basketball game a football match Malice at the palace like the police get involved like that is a problem like that does not.

390
00:30:45,796 --> 00:30:53,900
Scott: I'm still of the opinion that if There is a like, you know a fight in ice hockey game You should be as you know, you show the press charges against the other.

391
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:56,478
Rym: But ice hockey's weird in that there are.

392
00:30:56,538 --> 00:30:59,108
Rym: no they're the only written rules about fighting.

393
00:30:59,248 --> 00:31:02,078
Rym: are that if you fight you and the person you fought with get five minutes?

394
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,939
Rym: and Then there's other penalties like if you instigated the fight.

395
00:31:06,241 --> 00:31:11,560
Scott: Versus if you had that fight on the street, you'd at least have like a night in jail or a summons or something.

396
00:31:11,721 --> 00:31:13,628
Scott: Yeah, right, but I'd like that.

397
00:31:13,969 --> 00:31:14,370
Rym: but there's.

398
00:31:14,411 --> 00:31:18,779
Rym: basically there's the written rules of fighting in hockey Which are very straightforward and very simple.

399
00:31:19,401 --> 00:31:28,969
Rym: And then there's the actual rules because like all hockey fans who watch hockey know that the rule is if two people are fighting and They're fine They followed the rules to start the fight.

400
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:32,805
Rym: the refs really can't stop them unless Someone wins the fight hour.

401
00:31:32,845 --> 00:31:38,220
Rym: It comes to the ground like and they follow these rules, but they're not written down anywhere.

402
00:31:38,802 --> 00:31:42,055
Rym: So what this video is is a humorous 10-minute long video.

403
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,300
Rym: I think it's a Bruins fan.

404
00:31:43,641 --> 00:31:47,277
Rym: They have a lot of March and in here, but that's because they're.

405
00:31:47,337 --> 00:31:48,060
Scott: he's an ass.

406
00:31:49,182 --> 00:31:50,972
Scott: Using him as an example, maybe they're not.

407
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,299
Scott: they're probably not a Bruins fan.

408
00:31:52,507 --> 00:31:59,600
Rym: Yeah They use him as an example of The player who tricks you into starting a fight and then go but walks away and you just get a penalty for nothing.

409
00:32:00,121 --> 00:32:00,842
Scott: Yeah scumbag.

410
00:32:01,163 --> 00:32:14,713
Rym: Yeah, but what this video does is in ten minutes it Explains in a humorous way, but actually like in a really really accurate way what the actual Unwritten rules are for fighting in hockey.

411
00:32:14,773 --> 00:32:29,020
Rym: So if you watch this video You'll understand why sometimes the refs break up a fight and why sometimes they don't like When fights get broken up how they get broken up and why like this video is actually really detailed and accurate.

412
00:32:29,522 --> 00:32:30,004
Rym: So what you got?

413
00:32:30,607 --> 00:32:42,418
Scott: Oh, so, you know our favorite word the f-word The most common word said in New York Yeah, supposedly according to scotsman calm and according to this new TV doc.

414
00:32:42,438 --> 00:32:44,248
Rym: Wait a minute Scottsman calm.

415
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:45,939
Rym: did a Scotsman write this?

416
00:32:46,783 --> 00:32:47,125
Scott: Maybe?

417
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:52,807
Scott: and also according to a BBC Scotland documentary still biased.

418
00:32:53,409 --> 00:32:54,553
Scott: I sure hope this isn't like.

419
00:32:54,593 --> 00:32:56,520
Scott: it seems to be a real news site, right?

420
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,092
Scott: This isn't one of those like fake Scottish news things.

421
00:32:59,855 --> 00:33:00,699
Scott: It seems real to me.

422
00:33:01,101 --> 00:33:04,435
Rym: I mean, no very few listeners called me out on a fake Scottish news.

423
00:33:04,496 --> 00:33:05,460
Rym: I talked about a while ago.

424
00:33:05,621 --> 00:33:07,915
Scott: That was uh, oh that was also Scottish.

425
00:33:08,035 --> 00:33:12,523
Scott: Yes Can't trust these Scottish Scotts, right?

426
00:33:12,844 --> 00:33:19,485
Rym: the one time I took the piss and like one person messaged me and they're like, uh There's no way that's true.

427
00:33:19,565 --> 00:33:19,806
Rym: Is it?

428
00:33:19,826 --> 00:33:35,517
Scott: and I was like, no, no anyway the point is According to this there used to be a thing called flighting or fleeting Which is basically a poetry duel or like a you know, a 16th century rap battle.

429
00:33:35,678 --> 00:33:37,847
Scott: Whoo It's how they describe it.

430
00:33:38,028 --> 00:33:39,535
Rym: I want to find a historic or an actor.

431
00:33:39,555 --> 00:33:40,379
Rym: I want to see one of these.

432
00:33:41,482 --> 00:33:57,680
Scott: but anyway in one such battle the flighting of Dunbar and Kennedy right in which which is a written account of The flighting that they had so it's like Dunbar and Kennedy had a rap battle a poetry battle, right?

433
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:11,139
Scott: Dunbar wrote down an account of it and in that account is supposedly the oldest known written You know occurrence of the word fuck.

434
00:34:12,243 --> 00:34:25,469
Scott: That if true is amazing Some very juicy language and points out one of the insults traded between the two poets was the phrase one fuck it fun ling Which is probably not how that's pronounced.

435
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:28,480
Scott: We need a Scottish person to pronounce it, right?

436
00:34:30,603 --> 00:34:33,619
Scott: But yeah, if true this is fascinating and great.

437
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,891
Rym: It's my most commonly it's all there is - it's very important word.

438
00:34:38,675 --> 00:34:45,723
Rym: Yeah, I use it So in the meta moment of GeekNights sounds a little weird I guess.

439
00:34:45,822 --> 00:34:48,114
Rym: we've said before we were doing the show remotely.

440
00:34:48,134 --> 00:34:52,109
Rym: as of today We are now live streaming the show remotely.

441
00:34:52,168 --> 00:34:57,392
Rym: that was more annoying to set up than you realize And I hope you well.

442
00:34:57,412 --> 00:34:58,620
Rym: there are 12 people watching this.

443
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,544
Rym: So I think you were.

444
00:34:59,565 --> 00:35:02,559
Rym: I think some people are hungry for the live streams to come back.

445
00:35:04,763 --> 00:35:07,119
Rym: The book club book, we're not reading books for playing video games.

446
00:35:08,146 --> 00:35:10,144
Rym: all that Hold on.

447
00:35:10,184 --> 00:35:11,387
Scott: I'm reading comic books.

448
00:35:11,848 --> 00:35:12,089
Rym: Yep.

449
00:35:12,651 --> 00:35:15,438
Rym: I'm mostly playing video games and reading nonfiction.

450
00:35:15,539 --> 00:35:18,128
Rym: I started You know that shattered sword book.

451
00:35:18,248 --> 00:35:19,254
Rym: now that Chris is reading it.

452
00:35:19,374 --> 00:35:20,520
Rym: I reread a chapter of it.

453
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,849
Rym: That was a particularly good chapter.

454
00:35:21,889 --> 00:35:25,866
Rym: So that's where I'm at in terms of books In terms of meta.

455
00:35:25,946 --> 00:35:34,760
Scott: I want to remind people that we have a semi official GeekNights' Discord server that you can come to and we do some streams there.

456
00:35:34,921 --> 00:35:37,674
Scott: They're low effort streams because it's way easier to do.

457
00:35:37,795 --> 00:35:39,886
Scott: then you go on Twitch Which is a big time.

458
00:35:39,906 --> 00:35:42,380
Scott: you know our YouTube which is a big time investment.

459
00:35:42,702 --> 00:35:45,639
Rym: It's more like you want to hang out in the room with like me or Scott.

460
00:35:45,659 --> 00:35:47,960
Rym: well Like I'm just playing XCOM or something, right?

461
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:48,720
Scott: It's like I'm playing.

462
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:56,839
Scott: civilization might as well click this one button that will make a stream happen and then if you can join in with a voice chat And you can even stream your own game or whatever, right?

463
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:00,355
Scott: I also want to remind people we have a forum.

464
00:36:00,656 --> 00:36:14,359
Scott: that's on our website community.frontrecruit.com and I want to remind people that there's an official GeekNights' newsletter, which is the kind of thing that you have time to Remember about that when you got nothing else to do.

465
00:36:15,681 --> 00:36:18,149
Rym: We do our other secret project of the other writing thing.

466
00:36:18,871 --> 00:36:19,853
Scott: Yes, there are secret.

467
00:36:19,934 --> 00:36:22,847
Scott: basically the GeekNights' newsletter is basically Secret.

468
00:36:22,948 --> 00:36:31,542
Scott: emails that I write only go to 300 or so people that are subscribed to it probably a small percentage of who read it and You can.

469
00:36:31,603 --> 00:36:38,291
Scott: actually there's actually a public archive of it that you can read the old emails But you know no one pays attention to it.

470
00:36:38,352 --> 00:36:42,393
Scott: I write it rarely, but if I'm stuck at home Yeah, got nothing else to do.

471
00:36:42,676 --> 00:36:47,560
Rym: similarly I'm restarting my Rym's-Rants where I did the Friday GeekNights on the patreon, so I'm gonna.

472
00:36:47,782 --> 00:36:49,798
Rym: I'm starting those up again this week.

473
00:36:51,462 --> 00:36:53,049
Scott: Got time to not cherish.

474
00:36:53,431 --> 00:36:55,279
Rym: Yep must spend must waste it.

475
00:36:56,904 --> 00:36:57,468
Rym: I must kill it.

476
00:36:58,072 --> 00:36:59,100
Rym: Mustn't kill time boy.

477
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:07,060
Rym: I find as I get older unless I rewatch the Simpsons I start to lose my precise Simpsons quoting abilities, and I get more generic.

478
00:37:07,261 --> 00:37:07,523
Rym: I gotta.

479
00:37:07,583 --> 00:37:10,440
Rym: I gotta rewatch seasons two through nine.

480
00:37:11,102 --> 00:37:13,550
Scott: I remember more quotes, and I forget like like.

481
00:37:13,691 --> 00:37:15,537
Scott: I know you know mustn't kill time boy.

482
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:16,480
Scott: Cherish it, right?

483
00:37:16,663 --> 00:37:17,358
Scott: That's the same.

484
00:37:17,942 --> 00:37:18,364
Rym: Can I get five?

485
00:37:18,424 --> 00:37:20,172
Scott: I couldn't tell you what episode it was.

486
00:37:20,232 --> 00:37:21,879
Scott: I couldn't tell you which old man said it.

487
00:37:22,522 --> 00:37:27,765
Rym: Oh, see I do remember the A plot and the B plots and where they line up though There's a occasional gaps.

488
00:37:28,005 --> 00:37:33,162
Rym: past season seven like I forgot that a bunch of choice lines Were in.

489
00:37:33,242 --> 00:37:39,600
Rym: the Homer learns how to box with Moe and I also forgot it ends with that montage of Moe saving everybody with the fan.

490
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,771
Rym: Okay, you don't remember this at all do you?

491
00:37:43,495 --> 00:37:43,636
Scott: Nope.

492
00:37:43,918 --> 00:37:50,236
Rym: Wow Homer boxes Mike Tyson and Don King is in it, but it's not Mike Tyson and Don King that one.

493
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:52,960
Rym: okay Yeah, they used to call me kid gorgeous.

494
00:37:55,401 --> 00:37:56,867
Rym: So yeah follow us and all the stuff.

495
00:37:56,927 --> 00:37:59,075
Rym: watch our YouTube channels, we're doing more and more.

496
00:37:59,155 --> 00:38:00,340
Rym: we're streaming again bit by bit.

497
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:04,291
Rym: We're gonna crank out more and more content, but now something amazing happened.

498
00:38:04,311 --> 00:38:22,238
Rym: both Scott and I are playing an Animal Crossing game which I Was aware that Animal Crossing existed But for much of my adult life I've all I knew was it's the game Where you just talk to animals in a little town and I didn't really know anything else about it

499
00:38:23,383 --> 00:38:23,504
Scott: Right.

500
00:38:23,524 --> 00:38:33,250
Scott: Well, I mean so Animal Crossing First appeared on the GameCube right and when it came out It was like the one first party in Nintendo GameCube game that I didn't go for.

501
00:38:34,461 --> 00:38:37,840
Rym: Well, it came out on the n64, but I don't think that one came out in the US.

502
00:38:38,342 --> 00:38:49,012
Scott: No, so actually so that the real story is in Japan the original one which I think is called it's like The Japanese name is like dobutsu something cuz dobutsu is animal.

503
00:38:49,052 --> 00:38:49,734
Scott: Yep, right.

504
00:38:49,834 --> 00:38:51,800
Scott: It's like dobutsu something which means forest.

505
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,747
Scott: I think it's animal forest and not crossing.

506
00:38:53,867 --> 00:38:58,823
Scott: Anyway, the point is that original n64 one was Japan only.

507
00:38:58,843 --> 00:39:03,060
Rym: Yep, and then enhanced and released with new right hand on the GameCube, right?

508
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:11,238
Scott: Then they made it like a. it was like an upgraded version on the GameCube But that upgraded version on the GameCube is what the original US release was.

509
00:39:11,298 --> 00:39:16,080
Rym: Yep Similar shenanigans happened with some of the early advance Wars games like similar stuff went down.

510
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:21,484
Scott: It's similar to what happened with the Zelda game that came out on GameCube and Wii.

511
00:39:21,966 --> 00:39:22,708
Rym: Oh, yeah.

512
00:39:22,728 --> 00:39:23,510
Scott: Yeah, right.

513
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:24,653
Scott: Was that Twilight Princess?

514
00:39:24,713 --> 00:39:28,234
Scott: I think yeah, I'm on GameCube and we you know I never finished that one here.

515
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:36,200
Scott: Anyway, anyway So Yeah, but what I knew about Animal Crossing was this I knew that it was a game.

516
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,840
Scott: We're like you're a person who gets made it to be the mayor of a village.

517
00:39:40,361 --> 00:39:52,583
Scott: You have to pay off debts and you do lots of basically no skill busy work right collecting and selling fruit Playing some sort of turnip stock market game fishing Collecting stuff.

518
00:39:52,703 --> 00:39:53,386
Scott: Yep, right.

519
00:39:53,787 --> 00:39:58,202
Scott: I was sort of just like and I knew character busy work collecting kind of game Like I knew.

520
00:39:58,222 --> 00:40:08,383
Rym: I knew there's Tom Nook because people would talk about Tom Nook a lot like Animal Crossing was widely Represented in my social media and like in the wider gaming spaces I inhabited.

521
00:40:08,443 --> 00:40:13,718
Rym: even though I did not play it myself and I didn't really know a lot of people who played it I would encounter it kind of often.

522
00:40:14,741 --> 00:40:17,872
Scott: Yeah, no, I mean I knew and you know enough about it tangentially.

523
00:40:17,972 --> 00:40:20,220
Scott: I just never actually played one.

524
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:24,959
Scott: Yep, right because I didn't feel like I needed to because I knew I felt I knew what kind of game it was.

525
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:29,555
Scott: Yeah, so but the new one came out which I probably also wasn't planning to buy.

526
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:38,700
Scott: I didn't buy on the first day But we're stuck inside and there's nothing else to do and all our friends are playing it like everyone's literally everyone's playing it.

527
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:43,980
Scott: So I'm like well when in Rome, whatever I'll do this for a while and then I'll stop right but

528
00:40:44,061 --> 00:40:57,254
Rym: also partly because like a lot of our friends who were playing it are really into it like the people who like Animal Crossing Really like it and while we had tangential knowledge of it I feel like it's worth at least exploring and like playing what this game actually is.

529
00:40:57,274 --> 00:41:01,487
Scott: and so I did play The Animal Crossing actually on iOS.

530
00:41:02,008 --> 00:41:03,974
Scott: the happy whatever right?

531
00:41:04,114 --> 00:41:04,976
Scott: wasn't that game?

532
00:41:05,277 --> 00:41:06,240
Rym: mobile game though?

533
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:08,900
Scott: Yeah, no actually it wasn't really much of a game.

534
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,348
Scott: It wasn't really much like Animal Crossing for real.

535
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:18,834
Scott: basically all it was is Animal Crossing styled game where you can decorate your little area right.

536
00:41:18,894 --> 00:41:30,810
Scott: it was all about decorating your area and The way to decorate the area was like basically pay money right there wasn't all the like this Do task wise really.

537
00:41:31,211 --> 00:41:39,059
Rym: so I guess if I had to describe Animal Crossing Well, we're gonna review now because the only game we ever played is New Horizons, which we're playing actively.

538
00:41:39,099 --> 00:41:44,403
Rym: now We've played another reviewing the old ones yep, but if I had to describe this game just as a reviewer.

539
00:41:44,503 --> 00:41:45,506
Rym: I would say that it is.

540
00:41:46,369 --> 00:41:51,785
Rym: it is a game about talking to animals and making them happy and everything else kind of.

541
00:41:51,805 --> 00:42:00,158
Rym: and I will talk to animals try to make them happy while curating your little animal village and Slowly investing in it and then customizing it.

542
00:42:00,962 --> 00:42:05,380
Scott: I think it's more basically just the world's most advanced cookie clicker.

543
00:42:06,884 --> 00:42:09,091
Scott: So you think about some of that going on right.

544
00:42:09,111 --> 00:42:16,019
Scott: so cookie clicker you click and you get stuff Right and you click and you get stuff and then eventually get enough stuff that you can buy.

545
00:42:16,663 --> 00:42:22,385
Scott: Something the same could be said of all Diablo games sure But there's no.

546
00:42:22,425 --> 00:42:23,190
Scott: there's no skill.

547
00:42:23,391 --> 00:42:25,060
Scott: There's very little skill to the clicking.

548
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,104
Scott: Yeah There's some.

549
00:42:26,164 --> 00:42:26,909
Scott: there's medicine.

550
00:42:26,929 --> 00:42:39,560
Rym: the skill mess up catching a fish now And then the skill is more like the people who get to get into this game Will learn techniques and have patterns and like fastest pads to paying off debts and make charts to figure out a turnip market.

551
00:42:39,901 --> 00:42:40,624
Scott: It's just simple.

552
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:41,607
Scott: It's just simple.

553
00:42:41,788 --> 00:42:44,980
Scott: You know an extra layer of management of the clicks, right?

554
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:49,020
Scott: It's not based on your skill right of pushing buttons is what I'm right.

555
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,465
Scott: It's just you get you.

556
00:42:50,686 --> 00:42:51,890
Scott: the trees grow fruit.

557
00:42:52,392 --> 00:42:54,580
Scott: some things are like an idle game.

558
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,806
Scott: They're time based.

559
00:42:55,827 --> 00:43:02,316
Scott: you wait for the fruit to grow and then you write Yeah, but you have to because the game is attached to a real-time clock.

560
00:43:02,537 --> 00:43:05,168
Scott: unless you cheat You know you have to pick.

561
00:43:05,188 --> 00:43:07,000
Scott: you have to be on top of it, right?

562
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:13,916
Scott: You have to pick your fruit when it gets ready sort of like You know the real-time submarine game.

563
00:43:14,237 --> 00:43:17,599
Rym: oh, yes Subterfuge yeah, right.

564
00:43:17,982 --> 00:43:28,160
Scott: But I kind of like that in one sense like when I first want to sell your fruit on a different island Your native fruit on a different island to get more money and sell your other fruits locally to get more money, right?

565
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,549
Rym: Yeah, well, there's a bunch of like sort of meta games within like.

566
00:43:30,569 --> 00:43:32,839
Rym: there's the cookie clicker aspect of get all the stuff.

567
00:43:33,322 --> 00:43:42,740
Rym: then there's the like more of a playground like Lego aspect of Super customize your island because that's like the endgame like just make yes, but they it feeds into each other.

568
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:46,120
Scott: You can't super customize your island if you don't have enough money.

569
00:43:46,301 --> 00:43:47,886
Scott: Yep, right you need to get.

570
00:43:47,906 --> 00:43:52,040
Scott: you need to play the game of grinding away at the different lanes, right?

571
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,044
Scott: You can grind it fish.

572
00:43:53,445 --> 00:43:54,791
Scott: You can grind it seashells.

573
00:43:54,831 --> 00:43:59,880
Scott: You can grind at tree at farming Yeah, you can grind at the turnip stock market.

574
00:44:00,261 --> 00:44:02,069
Rym: But then there's this other parallel game of.

575
00:44:02,089 --> 00:44:07,399
Rym: you can grind at bug catching as you meet new villagers And get them to move into your island bit by bit and they come and go.

576
00:44:07,882 --> 00:44:16,778
Rym: You can try to learn what each one's deal is because they all have like a pretty particular Deal and based on how they react and you give him right gifts and try to make him happy and like.

577
00:44:16,798 --> 00:44:18,316
Rym: there's a whole like side game there.

578
00:44:19,961 --> 00:44:28,498
Rym: Mmm, I guess I don't pay attention to that too much because it's like, you know I really want my villagers to like me and I really try to come up with like specific gifts based on.

579
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,751
Rym: like My bird bro was like he.

580
00:44:30,832 --> 00:44:33,645
Rym: every time I talked to him for two days He was like complaining of it.

581
00:44:33,705 --> 00:44:34,428
Rym: I can't catch fish.

582
00:44:34,689 --> 00:44:37,779
Rym: So I gave him some bait and he got really fucking jazzed about it.

583
00:44:38,322 --> 00:44:38,584
Scott: Okay.

584
00:44:39,187 --> 00:44:47,180
Scott: Yeah, it's like I mostly like, you know, I Other people seem to really want particular villagers to move because some of them are ugly or weird or terrifying.

585
00:44:47,321 --> 00:44:48,545
Scott: They're kicking out villagers.

586
00:44:48,586 --> 00:44:50,072
Scott: They don't like for me.

587
00:44:50,212 --> 00:44:52,160
Scott: All the villagers seem kind of equal in man.

588
00:44:52,221 --> 00:44:53,718
Scott: I don't really care about any of them.

589
00:44:54,001 --> 00:44:54,442
Rym: I like a few.

590
00:44:54,462 --> 00:44:54,744
Rym: I like.

591
00:44:54,824 --> 00:44:59,383
Scott: I like the choice like the list of all villagers and like none of them were like Like.

592
00:44:59,503 --> 00:45:00,768
Scott: oh man, that's a great villager.

593
00:45:00,788 --> 00:45:01,832
Rym: I there's a few.

594
00:45:01,872 --> 00:45:02,153
Rym: I like.

595
00:45:02,214 --> 00:45:04,462
Rym: Isabelle's pretty chill, but she's not really a villager She's special.

596
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:05,746
Scott: No, it's like I have.

597
00:45:06,087 --> 00:45:09,158
Scott: one of the ones I got immediately was puck the hockey playing penguin.

598
00:45:09,238 --> 00:45:11,385
Scott: Oh, I want him He's okay.

599
00:45:11,425 --> 00:45:12,870
Scott: He's you know, I guess he's maybe the.

600
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:13,593
Scott: I guess the two.

601
00:45:13,653 --> 00:45:21,740
Rym: I started like I got plucky Who's just like chill and see I got deep down for whatever and I got the bird bro Pierce the lift weightlifting guy.

602
00:45:22,644 --> 00:45:27,651
Scott: I have a. I have a bird bro who likes Exercising but I don't think his name is Pierce.

603
00:45:27,912 --> 00:45:28,556
Rym: I forget their names.

604
00:45:28,576 --> 00:45:29,100
Rym: I think it's Pierce.

605
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:32,812
Rym: I don't know the Animal Crossing characters names me either but that's so.

606
00:45:33,073 --> 00:45:35,681
Scott: I guess I'm not really care too much about that part of The game.

607
00:45:35,701 --> 00:45:52,603
Scott: I guess it's just you want to eventually get the maximum number of houses onto your island full of People because that's how you like get to the end game of the k/k slider concert, I guess If there is such a thing as Pierce Right.

608
00:45:52,623 --> 00:46:00,820
Scott: It's like the game provides for you this path of Upgrading stuff where you get you you actually get the stuff then you pay off the loan afterwards.

609
00:46:01,463 --> 00:46:04,920
Scott: But you don't have to pay off the loan because there's no interest and there's no due date.

610
00:46:05,201 --> 00:46:07,410
Rym: Yeah, everybody's about Tom Nook wanton bells.

611
00:46:07,691 --> 00:46:09,820
Rym: He doesn't want that many bells.

612
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:15,510
Scott: You could get a loan for your house upgrade it and literally never pay off that loan if you're satisfied with the current state of Your house.

613
00:46:15,776 --> 00:46:18,179
Scott: Yep So that's like if I like in the real world.

614
00:46:18,341 --> 00:46:25,898
Scott: Imagine like if I got a loan and bought a car and they said alright You only need to pay off that loan if you want to actually get a loan to buy a better car.

615
00:46:25,938 --> 00:46:31,928
Scott: if you're satisfied with that car never pay the loan and Will be never charge your interest or come after you.

616
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:35,100
Scott: it's like oh, so the lowest level car is free is what you're saying.

617
00:46:35,201 --> 00:46:37,300
Scott: Yeah, and the third is amazing.

618
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:40,653
Scott: Oh, you are I suspect the price of one lower level car.

619
00:46:40,713 --> 00:46:51,808
Scott: if you could have you would have stayed in the tent forever Like you could pay off the price of your Honda Civic and then you'll give you a loan for a mercy for a Mercedes or a BMW and you could just not pay that off.

620
00:46:51,828 --> 00:47:01,340
Rym: but I love you could how Tom Nook will like give me the loan But then I could deposit the entirety of what I owe him into my savings account and he'll pay me interest.

621
00:47:02,788 --> 00:47:05,625
Scott: Yeah It's it's kind of.

622
00:47:05,706 --> 00:47:06,712
Scott: it's not a real saying.

623
00:47:06,752 --> 00:47:07,195
Rym: there's villages.

624
00:47:07,215 --> 00:47:07,617
Rym: You're like what?

625
00:47:07,657 --> 00:47:10,548
Rym: Oh Matilda She looks angry and she's got.

626
00:47:10,588 --> 00:47:14,260
Rym: she's a kangaroo and she's got a little baby in her pouch who also looks angry.

627
00:47:14,823 --> 00:47:19,306
Scott: I'm just saying none of the villagers particularly appeal to me like I'm oh man I want that one in my village.

628
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:20,452
Rym: I can see.

629
00:47:20,532 --> 00:47:22,020
Rym: I definitely see some I do not want.

630
00:47:23,041 --> 00:47:25,251
Scott: All right, they all seem kind of equal to me.

631
00:47:25,411 --> 00:47:26,315
Scott: I'm not excited.

632
00:47:26,376 --> 00:47:27,380
Rym: Lopez looks pretty good.

633
00:47:28,414 --> 00:47:38,285
Scott: Yeah Yeah, so if you're someone who wants a video game that you know is it's not a completely an idle game like a candy Box because you have to do stuff.

634
00:47:38,987 --> 00:47:51,660
Scott: It's not completely a cookie clicker because the stuff you're doing has a little bit of Thinking and paying attention, you know Just click mindlessly like you have to push a when the the bait on the end of the fishing rod starts to shake, right?

635
00:47:51,941 --> 00:47:54,611
Scott: You have to sneak up on the bug and catch it.

636
00:47:54,631 --> 00:47:58,162
Scott: You have two different bugs work different ways sometimes Right.

637
00:47:58,342 --> 00:48:04,692
Scott: Yeah, you know, it's a. there's some definitely a lot of lottery aspects to it to keep you be You know the human mind trapped.

638
00:48:04,752 --> 00:48:05,940
Rym: Yeah, but I guess things are rare.

639
00:48:06,121 --> 00:48:06,783
Rym: Yeah, but what I?

640
00:48:06,803 --> 00:48:12,409
Scott: there's a lot of gotcha aspects to it as in not as in got you as in got you But gotcha, I got you on.

641
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:19,465
Rym: but I guess what draws me to it Like what I think its main strength is like on a real meta level is that it's a game about mooching around like you've got This world.

642
00:48:19,485 --> 00:48:22,787
Rym: you can kind of move around in it and there's a lot of different paths.

643
00:48:22,807 --> 00:48:29,307
Rym: like the lanes you were talking about all those different lanes and pads are Reasonably satisfying to fuss with on their own.

644
00:48:29,808 --> 00:48:41,220
Rym: So if you're just idle or bored or like it's evening you're laying in bed It's just a very calming chill game to go Like let's go talk to my villagers and chop some wood or I think that's that's the main thing in this game.

645
00:48:41,421 --> 00:48:47,440
Scott: Is that you know, even in those other like idle games I mentioned, right?

646
00:48:47,803 --> 00:48:50,320
Scott: There is still some kind of like pressure.

647
00:48:50,581 --> 00:48:59,872
Scott: It's either pressure from the back right trying to make you go forward Right, like you're playing you're playing cookie candy box.

648
00:49:00,012 --> 00:49:05,379
Scott: It's like well, alright, you got nothing going on right now You got to go go go get more candies get more lollipops, right?

649
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:12,467
Scott: Or if you're playing a normal at your average video game as pressure from the front you turn on Mario Brothers The goob is coming at you.

650
00:49:12,587 --> 00:49:12,809
Scott: Yep.

651
00:49:13,311 --> 00:49:14,438
Scott: You got to do something.

652
00:49:14,962 --> 00:49:18,889
Scott: Are you Even Super Mario Brothers right?

653
00:49:18,949 --> 00:49:19,772
Scott: or pac-man?

654
00:49:19,812 --> 00:49:22,400
Scott: the ghost is coming at you do something, right?

655
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:27,760
Scott: You have to do things, you know, the game is attacking you in Animal Crossing.

656
00:49:28,242 --> 00:49:30,651
Scott: There is no pressure from the front or back.

657
00:49:31,052 --> 00:49:37,840
Scott: You can go forward if you want But like I said, the loans have no interest and no due date.

658
00:49:38,091 --> 00:49:42,152
Scott: Yeah You can just move forward at any pace you like.

659
00:49:42,252 --> 00:49:54,499
Scott: if you don't want a bigger house if you don't want Progress and get more stuff if you don't have to no one's making you do anything Yeah, you can just chill and play in the space that has been provided for you.

660
00:49:55,041 --> 00:50:02,260
Scott: Right, and if you choose to do more stuff at whatever pace you do it at you will get more stuff eventually.

661
00:50:02,962 --> 00:50:04,947
Scott: Right, there's no time limit.

662
00:50:05,248 --> 00:50:07,092
Scott: There's no losing right.

663
00:50:07,232 --> 00:50:11,900
Scott: even if you only like sell your fruit once a week Eventually, you'll pay off the loan.

664
00:50:12,081 --> 00:50:18,815
Rym: the worst thing that can happen to you is you get stung by wasps twice or by a Tarantula once and pass out and it's like.

665
00:50:18,835 --> 00:50:23,780
Scott: it's like, you know Some people like so upset that they pass out and I'm like, I don't even care if a wasp gets me.

666
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:27,560
Scott: What happens like teleport a few feet away in two seconds and I could right.

667
00:50:28,041 --> 00:50:37,965
Scott: so I think the good aspect of this game is that and also the I guess it's simultaneously awesome, but also Unrealized potential.

668
00:50:37,985 --> 00:50:42,820
Scott: Yeah, is that the previous Animal Crossing games had multiplayer components?

669
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,546
Scott: I think I'm not sure.

670
00:50:44,606 --> 00:50:49,365
Scott: but I think the GameCube one used the online connector on the game Might.

671
00:50:49,405 --> 00:50:52,880
Scott: I don't know about that for sure, but I think I remember it doing that.

672
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,726
Scott: I don't not a hundred percent this one.

673
00:50:54,767 --> 00:50:57,878
Scott: Yes, the switch DS had the local wireless connectivity.

674
00:50:57,918 --> 00:51:00,675
Scott: It never worked Right, it worked.

675
00:51:00,897 --> 00:51:05,672
Scott: barely The DS wanted anyway, but then this one it had.

676
00:51:05,733 --> 00:51:08,704
Scott: if you have Nintendo online it has Internet.

677
00:51:09,105 --> 00:51:10,934
Scott: that sucks but works.

678
00:51:10,974 --> 00:51:16,575
Rym: Yep, like it actually does work I've gone to other people's islands and boots around and then gone back to my caveman Island.

679
00:51:16,595 --> 00:51:17,137
Rym: cuz I'm taking.

680
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:20,920
Rym: I'm playing the game Much more casually than a lot of our other friends, right?

681
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:36,080
Scott: So like you and this when it works, right the parts of it that do work work great and that you can sort of Experience this sort of like childlike Play with dolls Situations together, but that's it.

682
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:36,401
Rym: Like.

683
00:51:36,421 --> 00:51:37,906
Rym: the way I'm experiencing this game is.

684
00:51:38,228 --> 00:51:48,090
Rym: I'm just making this little village and like I'm putting trees in my house in a way That feels aesthetic for no particular reason and it's exactly the kind of mooching around play I would do with Legos as a kid, right?

685
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,416
Scott: Everyone's got a dollhouse.

686
00:51:49,516 --> 00:51:50,340
Scott: That's a whole island.

687
00:51:50,903 --> 00:51:53,396
Scott: Right, you can customize yours as much as you want.

688
00:51:53,798 --> 00:51:56,044
Scott: you can Visit other people's.

689
00:51:56,064 --> 00:51:57,067
Scott: they can visit yours.

690
00:51:57,227 --> 00:51:57,809
Scott: Oh, right.

691
00:51:57,849 --> 00:51:58,952
Scott: You can do stuff together.

692
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:00,176
Scott: Some parts are automatic.

693
00:52:00,216 --> 00:52:01,862
Scott: some part are still a game Right.

694
00:52:01,882 --> 00:52:04,211
Scott: It's like I could throw a fish bait and you can catch the fish.

695
00:52:04,713 --> 00:52:08,069
Scott: All right, you could be like, hey Let's both chop down trees here.

696
00:52:08,089 --> 00:52:09,839
Scott: Well, it'll we'll get it done twice as fast.

697
00:52:10,563 --> 00:52:19,660
Scott: All right, there's all sorts like these things you can do Together with other people in a in a in a true social way not like a fake social way.

698
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:24,520
Scott: Yep, well like look at our farm bill a farm bill social way, right which is bullshit, right?

699
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:26,208
Scott: Yeah, where as Animal Crossing is like?

700
00:52:26,249 --> 00:52:28,799
Scott: no you guys saw people in Animal Crossing for example.

701
00:52:29,321 --> 00:52:35,560
Scott: They went to a friend's island all together and they went to the museum and they took photos together in the museum.

702
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:40,838
Scott: Yep, right and they went just as if they were going to a real museum or like you see people will like.

703
00:52:41,038 --> 00:52:46,460
Rym: well like our Friends right now they're making spreadsheets and tracking the stock market and like coordinating investments.

704
00:52:46,661 --> 00:52:53,700
Rym: Like there's a lot of ways to have fun with this game No matter what you want to do because it's still the same shield all house, right?

705
00:52:53,740 --> 00:53:04,124
Scott: You can do whatever if you're into house customizing if you're into just the fishing right the collecting part you can do whatever part you want at any pace you want and It's alright.

706
00:53:04,708 --> 00:53:13,037
Rym: Yeah, I think it is magical that this game came out during our current crisis because I think this game came out at the exact right time.

707
00:53:13,057 --> 00:53:15,446
Scott: this this Came out at any other time.

708
00:53:15,506 --> 00:53:18,820
Scott: I wouldn't have even bought it or a bit like another Animal Crossing game out.

709
00:53:18,881 --> 00:53:19,551
Scott: Okay, whatever.

710
00:53:19,917 --> 00:53:25,688
Rym: Yep But this is I think a lot of people are gonna get in for the first time and also honestly for kids This game is great.

711
00:53:25,768 --> 00:53:26,753
Rym: This is just a kind of game.

712
00:53:26,773 --> 00:53:29,803
Rym: You can park it get in front of forever and It's fine.

713
00:53:29,843 --> 00:53:31,350
Rym: Like what they're doing in this game is fine.

714
00:53:31,390 --> 00:53:32,716
Rym: They'll learn they'll have fun.

715
00:53:32,757 --> 00:53:33,480
Rym: They'll poke around.

716
00:53:33,801 --> 00:53:35,468
Rym: It's not that different than what they do with their toys.

717
00:53:36,131 --> 00:53:38,460
Scott: It's definitely I think for some people it's good.

718
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:39,455
Scott: It's their main game.

719
00:53:40,181 --> 00:53:41,626
Scott: For me I see it more of.

720
00:53:41,967 --> 00:53:49,153
Scott: it's my game right now because the situation right now a long run It's like it's basically always your backup game.

721
00:53:49,193 --> 00:53:58,225
Rym: Like I would I feel like years from now I'll just like poke in and like poke at my island a little bit and go see what someone else's islands do in and then Just turn it off right?

722
00:53:58,285 --> 00:54:02,500
Scott: It's like, you know, if you if you're it's like I did, you know, I played my serious game.

723
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:04,406
Scott: I played my multiplayer game.

724
00:54:04,426 --> 00:54:09,541
Scott: I did all the stuff that I'm really into and now I'm just chilling for a minute All right.

725
00:54:09,561 --> 00:54:11,066
Scott: Well see what's on my island.

726
00:54:11,107 --> 00:54:13,976
Scott: I'll pick some weeds sell some fruit and save.

727
00:54:14,317 --> 00:54:17,449
Rym: there is one Very big problem with this game though.

728
00:54:18,392 --> 00:54:26,320
Rym: If you have multiple players in your household You cannot have two independent games unless you have two independent switches, right?

729
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,343
Scott: Well, you sort of can.

730
00:54:27,543 --> 00:54:30,633
Rym: right is that you can't drive the game forward.

731
00:54:30,653 --> 00:54:33,060
Rym: You can only drive your own house upgrades forward.

732
00:54:33,322 --> 00:54:34,008
Rym: You can't write.

733
00:54:34,069 --> 00:54:35,420
Rym: any other events happen on the island.

734
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:38,880
Scott: So me and Rym had one switch in the house and we both live together.

735
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:51,870
Scott: One the first person to turn the game on and start the game is the person who like is the village representative Person who has to pay off, you know The the loans and move the main plot of the game forward.

736
00:54:51,890 --> 00:55:04,940
Scott: the other person can still do all the stuff fishing Give things to the museum right You know all stuff right they can play the game, but they can't drive the main game forward.

737
00:55:05,422 --> 00:55:13,877
Scott: they would have to share their resources with the main person so that they could then Use those efforts towards driving the game forward.

738
00:55:13,897 --> 00:55:15,524
Scott: Yep Which is a

739
00:55:15,584 --> 00:55:15,886
Rym: real

740
00:55:15,926 --> 00:55:23,042
Scott: sort of all living together and working together in the same place But one person is in charge running the show Which is

741
00:55:23,102 --> 00:55:28,588
Rym: a real shame because if you have like someone who has more than one kid Which kid gets to be the primary player?

742
00:55:28,608 --> 00:55:31,076
Rym: because I'm not buying two switches like that is right.

743
00:55:31,156 --> 00:55:33,671
Scott: that has caused big Copies of the game.

744
00:55:34,035 --> 00:55:34,420
Rym: you can't know.

745
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:42,097
Rym: Okay, even if you have two separate cartridges it stores everything in the switch so you can study.

746
00:55:42,217 --> 00:55:44,723
Scott: you can't even put on the SD Card if it switches D cards.

747
00:55:44,784 --> 00:55:52,280
Rym: Nope, if you if I give you my cart and And then you give me your switch and we hand it to a third person and they start a game.

748
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:54,076
Rym: They'll be on your island because it's your switch.

749
00:55:54,953 --> 00:56:02,775
Scott: Okay but anyway But yeah, sometimes that situation of being on the same island could be correct.

750
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:04,360
Scott: right like you could imagine a family.

751
00:56:04,741 --> 00:56:09,320
Scott: We're like a four-person family and they all have houses on the island and they all work together.

752
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:13,720
Rym: Like Emily just moved into my island and we just kind of hang out and do the thing, but it's like that could be cool.

753
00:56:13,861 --> 00:56:18,036
Scott: But sometimes it's not what you want if it's two adults living in the house.

754
00:56:18,076 --> 00:56:19,200
Scott: They both want their own islands.

755
00:56:19,261 --> 00:56:33,770
Rym: you now need two switches or our friend Other Scott his Kid started the game first and then he made the second account like not knowing this problem and the child is not Particularly engaged in driving anything forward.

756
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:38,228
Rym: So the island you just log in as the child And yeah, but now you gotta play games like that.

757
00:56:38,810 --> 00:56:39,853
Scott: I feel like the problem.

758
00:56:40,837 --> 00:56:41,720
Scott: I don't see a problem with that.

759
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:43,591
Scott: Just log in as the child and do the thing.

760
00:56:43,611 --> 00:56:47,024
Scott: Yeah, the kid child might notice What are they gonna notice?

761
00:56:47,064 --> 00:56:49,192
Scott: that there's now a new building on the island right?

762
00:56:49,875 --> 00:56:50,979
Scott: You just tell them you did it.

763
00:56:53,023 --> 00:56:55,360
Rym: I just feel like this was a weird omission like it.

764
00:56:56,042 --> 00:57:00,115
Rym: I can't believe Nintendo didn't anticipate this being a big problem for people.

765
00:57:00,136 --> 00:57:02,199
Scott: Nintendo definitely You know.

766
00:57:02,241 --> 00:57:06,027
Scott: It's like I said There's so much missed Potential like the way the online works.

767
00:57:06,087 --> 00:57:08,113
Scott: only eight people on an island at a time.

768
00:57:08,153 --> 00:57:10,300
Scott: the island can only be so big.

769
00:57:10,902 --> 00:57:16,520
Scott: The egg thing is man, right and the when you join someone else's island, right?

770
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,148
Scott: it's like there's this huge cutscene.

771
00:57:18,188 --> 00:57:23,149
Scott: that cutscene is so fucking long and There's a lot of connection issues.

772
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:29,660
Scott: and think it's because Nintendo I think was Expecting this to be like children playing the game together like someone joining the island.

773
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:38,508
Scott: They would come and stay and play a while Yeah and you wouldn't have people coming in and out and in and out and in and out and in and out just to sell their Turnips and leave like with a chain of right.

774
00:57:38,528 --> 00:57:41,817
Scott: We're definitely not playing the game as intended, right?

775
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:44,424
Scott: Yeah Don't.

776
00:57:44,484 --> 00:57:49,740
Scott: brains can understand You know the systems and exploit them because they're not meant for adult.

777
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:52,890
Rym: Yeah And exploiting the systems is part of the fun for adults to like.

778
00:57:52,950 --> 00:57:53,071
Rym: it's.

779
00:57:53,472 --> 00:57:58,228
Rym: it's kind of fun to sell all your turnips for 600 bells apiece and make a fortune.

780
00:57:58,248 --> 00:57:59,071
Rym: Yeah.

781
00:57:59,091 --> 00:58:02,343
Scott: Well, I have the fortune now and now I don't need to play the stupid turnip game Ever anymore.

782
00:58:02,363 --> 00:58:03,387
Scott: That's mostly why I did it.

783
00:58:03,407 --> 00:58:05,035
Scott: Yeah, like I just want to have enough money.

784
00:58:05,055 --> 00:58:06,200
Scott: I can stop grinding.

785
00:58:07,162 --> 00:58:08,732
Rym: Yep, I'm just gonna keep doing what I'm doing.

786
00:58:08,752 --> 00:58:13,240
Rym: I feel like for the long haul I'll just like poke at this game every day a little bit and like laying in bed.

787
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:16,299
Rym: I might just log out and just see what's doing and just sort of mooch around.

788
00:58:17,165 --> 00:58:25,938
Scott: Yeah, and one thing that's nice about it I got to say is that for you know as much of a cookie-clicker idle, you know grindy game.

789
00:58:25,978 --> 00:58:26,299
Scott: it is.

790
00:58:27,302 --> 00:58:29,989
Scott: One thing they did that I wish other grindy games would do.

791
00:58:30,170 --> 00:58:33,760
Scott: is they sort of mostly put caps on grinding ability.

792
00:58:34,021 --> 00:58:35,386
Scott: Yeah, you can.

793
00:58:35,607 --> 00:58:39,280
Scott: on your island you hit all your rocks up to eight times each a day.

794
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:41,568
Scott: Maybe you accidentally have so many rocks.

795
00:58:42,030 --> 00:58:43,636
Scott: You can only you pick all your fruit.

796
00:58:43,756 --> 00:58:44,780
Scott: Okay, I picked all my fruit.

797
00:58:45,325 --> 00:58:46,780
Scott: You can go around catching bugs.

798
00:58:47,202 --> 00:58:48,972
Scott: Eventually, you've caught every bug right?

799
00:58:49,052 --> 00:58:50,440
Scott: It's like you can go keep fishing.

800
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:53,915
Scott: It's like you can keep doing those things there as long as you want.

801
00:58:53,955 --> 00:58:55,020
Rym: Maybe I'll go to other islands.

802
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:56,433
Rym: Well, I only got so many nook miles.

803
00:58:56,513 --> 00:58:57,260
Rym: I can only get some right.

804
00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:01,160
Scott: You can't use your nook miles to get tickets to go to other islands to get more stuff.

805
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,051
Scott: But eventually it's like you're sort of gated.

806
00:59:04,132 --> 00:59:04,714
Scott: It's like okay.

807
00:59:04,754 --> 00:59:06,180
Scott: I've crafted everything I've got.

808
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:14,503
Scott: It's like this can't go that far right and because of the real-time clock unless you cheat and move your clock forward It's like okay.

809
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:16,651
Scott: I've done everything I can do today.

810
00:59:16,731 --> 00:59:18,016
Scott: I can't play anymore today.

811
00:59:18,136 --> 00:59:19,060
Scott: put the game down.

812
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:25,457
Scott: It doesn't keep you locked in grinding like a MMO does like you've done basically what you can do for today.

813
00:59:25,558 --> 00:59:29,339
Scott: if you keep grinding You're you won't really make that much progress.

814
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:33,800
Rym: Yep, and also real time and it just makes it a nice sort of conference with for the real world.

815
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:37,173
Rym: Like if I log in at night, it's night the first day.

816
00:59:37,233 --> 00:59:37,796
Rym: I played the game.

817
00:59:37,836 --> 00:59:38,920
Rym: It was pouring rain outside.

818
00:59:39,101 --> 00:59:41,151
Rym: So I turned the game on pouring rain.

819
00:59:41,493 --> 00:59:42,920
Scott: I don't think it checks the real weather.

820
00:59:43,765 --> 00:59:44,107
Rym: It did.

821
00:59:44,187 --> 00:59:50,540
Rym: seems it's definitely I'm seeing for now I haven't seen it rain in my game except when it's been rainy in the New York area.

822
00:59:51,022 --> 00:59:58,460
Scott: I'll have to check and see if it actually uses GPS and some weather day Under the impression the weather was random, but I could be wrong about that.

823
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:04,064
Rym: Yeah, it's happened to be since I bought the game if it's been rainy in this area It's been rainy in the game.

824
01:00:04,164 --> 01:00:06,575
Rym: And when it's been sunny out, it's been not rainy in the game.

825
01:00:07,198 --> 01:00:07,740
Scott: It's interesting.

826
01:00:08,783 --> 01:00:11,647
Scott: Might just be a weird coincidence I think it might be.

827
01:00:11,908 --> 01:00:20,340
Rym: but the day-night cycle to like get I get up in the morning my villagers are up to different stuff and Like blathers is like falling asleep because he's an owl and he wants to sleep.

828
01:00:21,301 --> 01:00:29,499
Rym: Yeah, and like I go at night really a lot of villages like wandered around a lot at night But the other one's always asleep at night and there's like I like watching my villagers just do stuff.

829
01:00:30,263 --> 01:00:36,380
Scott: Yeah, I mean regardless of my not caring about villagers just the aesthetic of the game I think is a large part of the appeal.

830
01:00:36,525 --> 01:00:40,298
Scott: Oh, yeah You said you want to make stuff look a certain way and you wanna.

831
01:00:40,318 --> 01:00:42,949
Scott: you know A lot of cute things and a lot of dialogue.

832
01:00:42,969 --> 01:00:45,920
Rym: I spent a lot of time thinking about how to decorate the outside of my house.

833
01:00:46,741 --> 01:00:51,980
Scott: Yeah, that kind of thing right the decoration aspect right is is a large part of it.

834
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:54,430
Scott: That doesn't require that much grinding actually the game.

835
01:00:54,450 --> 01:01:06,040
Scott: if like you just want to decorate or dress up The game gives you plenty of clothes and furniture without much effort Yep, and also it doesn't fall into the trap Nintendo is repeatedly fallen into in the past.

836
01:01:06,321 --> 01:01:12,760
Rym: It does not tie guy and girl like hairstyles to guy and girl selections, right?

837
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:19,380
Scott: You have to choose sort of like, you know, one of the two character model shapes at the start, but they're just two blobs.

838
01:01:20,388 --> 01:01:21,720
Scott: Yeah, there's mostly two blobs.

839
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:23,508
Scott: I think it's more like what they start with.

840
01:01:23,588 --> 01:01:33,724
Scott: clothing and hair wise is different by default But then you can customize them quite a bit terms of eyes and hair and stuff and then once you're in the game You can do whatever.

841
01:01:33,825 --> 01:01:37,737
Scott: I could wear a skirt and get long hair and do whatever.

842
01:01:37,757 --> 01:01:40,483
Scott: Yeah, so You do you can do you.

843
01:01:40,824 --> 01:01:46,480
Rym: so the other thing apparently the game the other flaw the save data does not sync to the Nintendo online.

844
01:01:47,541 --> 01:01:49,910
Rym: Yeah, so if your switch gets destroyed, you're just fucked.

845
01:01:49,930 --> 01:01:50,692
Rym: It's all gone forever.

846
01:01:50,753 --> 01:01:51,134
Rym: Fuck you.

847
01:01:51,857 --> 01:01:52,258
Scott: That's true.

848
01:01:52,439 --> 01:02:04,980
Rym: That is I feel like that is an even more glaring omission because Nintendo cannot be under the misapprehension That people will not care that much if they lose the 10 year long Animal Crossing game.

849
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:07,192
Rym: They've poured into their ancient dying switch.

850
01:02:07,936 --> 01:02:08,177
Scott: Yep.

851
01:02:08,499 --> 01:02:15,440
Scott: Yep Oh the one last thing that genius thing that they added is the custom Build the custom artwork thing.

852
01:02:15,646 --> 01:02:24,551
Scott: Yeah so you can make custom artwork on squares which can be used for various things like hanging up on the wall or Simple clothing and stuff like that.

853
01:02:24,611 --> 01:02:26,451
Scott: Just you do pixel art in the game Yep.

854
01:02:27,461 --> 01:02:32,740
Scott: And then you can just advanced pixel art you can do in the game pro designs for specific articles of clothing.

855
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:38,760
Scott: It's like I want to make a hat I want to make a hoodie and you can do pixel art on these templates to make custom clothing.

856
01:02:38,841 --> 01:02:41,840
Scott: So I made like a boo hoodie, which has boo the ghost on it, right?

857
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:50,080
Scott: And as long as no one like reports you because you right well And then you can share your things online with other people, right?

858
01:02:50,181 --> 01:02:52,700
Scott: You can use them in the game this QR code system.

859
01:02:52,780 --> 01:03:00,102
Scott: There's all kinds of systems for sharing all these custom clothing designs and that requires absolutely no grinding whatsoever Like you.

860
01:03:00,122 --> 01:03:04,819
Scott: just have that so you could start the game up and do very little grinding and as soon as you.

861
01:03:04,879 --> 01:03:08,313
Scott: I guess I don't know if it's immediately unlocked, but it's very early unlocked.

862
01:03:08,794 --> 01:03:13,099

01:04:13,668 --> 01:04:15,704
Rym: Yeah, I Didn't have anything.

876
01:04:15,865 --> 01:04:18,880
Rym: I just wasn't gonna make a bunch of fences cuz I didn't have enough wood handy.

877
01:04:18,961 --> 01:04:20,838
Rym: So I just dug a pit around him and left him there.

878
01:04:21,562 --> 01:04:26,807

883
01:04:38,472 --> 01:04:50,280
Scott: the only Pokemon games I beat were the first two maybe Two or three and then after that I played every Pokemon game, but I would only get so many gyms.

884
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:53,398
Rym: I think I actually hear Animal Crossing happening in the other room right now.

885
01:04:53,861 --> 01:04:57,440
Scott: Yeah, every other Pokemon game I would play some number of gyms and then stop right?

886
01:04:58,400 --> 01:04:58,541
Scott: Whereas?

887
01:04:58,682 --> 01:05:01,999
Scott: and that Pokemon could be your go-to game to fall back on?

888
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:07,080
Scott: Yeah, right, but I think for most people the Animal Crossing is actually the alright.

01:05:08,544 --> 01:05:19,600
