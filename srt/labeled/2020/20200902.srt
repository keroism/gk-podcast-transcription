1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,270
Rym: It's Wednesday, September 2nd, 2020.

2
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:10,551
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,103 --> 00:00:13,480
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,065
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,105 --> 00:00:18,780
Rym: Tonight, we are talking about The Spider-Man.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,818
Scott: Let's do this!

7
00:00:25,181 --> 00:00:27,359
Rym: So I haven't really been, like, taking days off work.

8
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:39,760
Rym: 'Cause usually in my normal life, I spend, like, every goddamn vacation day doing, like, the required family visit trips, and, like, all the conventions we perform at, and, like, one vacation.

9
00:00:40,182 --> 00:00:44,220
Rym: And I'm always, like, down to my last half day of vacation time by the end of every year.

10
00:00:44,482 --> 00:00:45,178
Rym: Like, I just use them all.

11
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,580
Rym: But this year, I can't really go anywhere.

12
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:56,620
Rym: Like, it feels weird to take a day, like, a vacation day to just not sit at my desk and work for half the day.

13
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:05,459
Scott: Well, I mean, if I'm sitting at home doing nothing, right, on my work day, I'm not gonna use a vacation day to do the same exact fucking thing.

14
00:01:06,243 --> 00:01:08,319
Rym: I do more work than you do when I'm at home.

15
00:01:09,141 --> 00:01:12,060
Scott: If I can't vacation, why am I spending a vacation day?

16
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,919
Scott: I'm just wasting it as bullshit, but I think they're only gonna let--.

17
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:18,380
Scott: I don't know, it's already September.

18
00:01:18,981 --> 00:01:21,420
Rym: I can carry 10 days over to next year.

19
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,360
Scott: I can also carry 10 over, but I already carried--.

20
00:01:24,441 --> 00:01:24,959
Rym: I've got 14 left.

21
00:01:25,641 --> 00:01:27,519
Scott: I already carried 10 over.

22
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:30,600
Scott: Am I just gonna take off, like, a whole month or something?

23
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:41,576
Rym: Well, one thing that helped me is I was nearing vacation debt almost, because I took more time than usual off for all the, like, end-of-year cons last year, and then the start-of-year cons this year.

24
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:57,598
Rym: Like, I basically took a lot of extra days off around, like, MagFest and PacSouth and all that, so I was running near, like, I was scraping the bottom of the barrel, so I didn't bring any over from last year, but now I have 14 to use, and I gotta use at least four of them by the end of the year or I lose them.

25
00:01:58,963 --> 00:02:00,220
Rym: So I'm using one on Friday.

26
00:02:00,641 --> 00:02:01,996
Scott: I got way more than that, so...

27
00:02:02,461 --> 00:02:04,660
Rym: 'Cause I used so many already.

28
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,320
Scott: I put on my task list to tomorrow figure out what to do with them.

29
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,920
Scott: I think I'm gonna not be working a lot the rest of the year now, actually, 'cause it's already September.

30
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:13,901
Rym: Yup.

31
00:02:14,163 --> 00:02:16,180
Rym: I'm in the middle of big stuff at work, so I'm not gonna do that.

32
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,540
Rym: Also, I don't wanna take, like-- I definitely don't wanna take, like, a whole week off.

33
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,060
Scott: I've got a little big stuff, but I don't care how it works.

34
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:27,479
Rym: Yeah, so I'm basically-- I'm taking a day off Friday, 'cause I had that day off, like, already set up, ready for PAX.

35
00:02:28,164 --> 00:02:29,999
Scott: Yeah, I guess I could do that if everyone else is.

36
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:33,260
Rym: Yeah, so I'm gonna have a four-day weekend.

37
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,760
Rym: This is the longest time off I've had since the quarantine started from working.

38
00:02:39,062 --> 00:02:40,740
Rym: And I'll see if the weather's nice.

39
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:43,216
Scott: It's very-- One thing I noticed-- Seems like it's gonna be.

40
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,800
Rym: Normally in our lives, like, this time of year, we always go to Seattle.

41
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:58,195
Rym: And not every time-- Like, don't think that I'm saying every time we go to Seattle, but I feel like 80-ish percent of the times we've gone to Seattle over the years, it's unseasonably sunny during PAX.

42
00:02:58,216 --> 00:03:00,832
Rym: while we're there, and everyone local is like, "Yeah, it's never this

43
00:03:00,852 --> 00:03:01,074
Rym: sunny.".

44
00:03:02,221 --> 00:03:05,180
Rym: It's like we're there during, like, the sunny weekend.

45
00:03:06,042 --> 00:03:09,480
Rym: But now, the first time since 2008, we are not flying to Seattle for PAX.

46
00:03:10,161 --> 00:03:11,979
Rym: It's been Seattle weather, like, all week here.

47
00:03:12,561 --> 00:03:17,780
Rym: It's just, like, humid and overcast and chilly, and maybe it's us.

48
00:03:19,344 --> 00:03:20,600
Scott: You think the weather just follows you.

49
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,718
Rym: Maybe the weather just follows us.

50
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:22,837
Rym: Uh-huh.

51
00:03:23,061 --> 00:03:23,388
Rym: You and me.

52
00:03:23,408 --> 00:03:23,940
Rym: GeekNights.

53
00:03:24,381 --> 00:03:27,259
Scott: It wasn't the RIT president controlling the weather at RIT.

54
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,179
Scott: It was you the whole time.

55
00:03:28,301 --> 00:03:29,530
Rym: It could have been both of us.

56
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,820
Rym: It could have been our powers combined.

57
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:31,854
Scott: It's still you.

58
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,060
Rym: Might be you.

59
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,267
Scott: We're the weather twins.

60
00:03:34,307 --> 00:03:35,959
Scott: We touch each other, and then weather comes down.

61
00:03:38,402 --> 00:03:44,618
Rym: Man, I just had to-- You even saying that weather machine thing just gave me this weird flashback to, like, freshman year at RIT.

62
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,460
Rym: And GDT in particular.

63
00:03:48,464 --> 00:03:48,676
Scott: Okay.

64
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:50,138
Rym: All right.

65
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,103
Rym: Yeah, it's Wednesday.

66
00:03:51,183 --> 00:03:55,120
Rym: Talking about animation, comics, manga, anime, all that stuff.

67
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,660
Rym: You got any news or Geek Bytes or something to talk about?

68
00:03:58,282 --> 00:04:03,280
Scott: There's not a lot of news going on for me to talk about, so I went down the Geek Bite hole, right?

69
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,619
Scott: People are going to say, "Scott, why are you reading comics if you're not reading the book club

70
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:07,820
Scott: book?".

71
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:12,857
Scott: It's like, "Yo, comic book takes, like, 10 minutes to read,

72
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:13,319
Scott: right?".

73
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,077
Scott: You know, you don't got to, like, sit down and, like, you know, warm up anything to read.

74
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:21,499
Scott: a, you know, like you do to read a giant enormous book like Telegenji.

75
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,700
Rym: Like, some comics, you can finish the whole thing in one poop.

76
00:04:25,481 --> 00:04:27,720
Scott: Yeah, so I've had this book for a while.

77
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:33,994
Scott: It has a number one on the side of it, implying that it is volume one of more than one, but I can assure you it is one of one.

78
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,780
Scott: So this was kickstarted about two years ago.

79
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:38,939
Scott: It's called Bingo Love.

80
00:04:39,702 --> 00:04:40,720
Scott: It's pretty straightforward.

81
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:48,360
Scott: It's a story about two black girls who were lesbians in, like, the 60s, and then they were separated.

82
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:54,680
Scott: You know, it's not a nonfiction story, but it doesn't have anything supernatural in it, right?

83
00:04:54,821 --> 00:04:56,519
Scott: It could be real, right?

84
00:04:58,341 --> 00:05:04,281
Scott: And I guess it has some future stuff in it, because part of the story takes place after 2020.

85
00:05:04,281 --> 00:05:07,260
Scott: But regardless, there's nothing like sci-fi about that, right?

86
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,579
Scott: It's just, you know, whatever.

87
00:05:08,961 --> 00:05:10,459
Rym: Yeah, that's just near future, let's go.

88
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:11,953
Scott: They were lesbians in the 60s.

89
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:18,540
Scott: They were separated by their, you know, very conservative 60s parents and church and such, right?

90
00:05:19,582 --> 00:05:23,140
Scott: And then for 50 years, they didn't, you know, see each other.

91
00:05:23,542 --> 00:05:25,917
Scott: And then suddenly, they saw each other after 50 years.

92
00:05:28,641 --> 00:05:36,260
Scott: So this is kickstarted about a few years ago, and I knew about it then, but I didn't pick it up until Image published it.

93
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,660
Scott: All right, so Image, you know, this was originally published by, I think, Inclusive Press.

94
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,860
Scott: And the graphic novel was only like 80 or so, 90 pages, something like that, when it was kickstarted.

95
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,199
Scott: When Image picked it up, right, it already had sort of a thing, right?

96
00:05:51,701 --> 00:06:02,500
Scott: So the new edition that I have, which is the Bingo Love jackpot edition, after the 80 page graphic novel concludes, the rest of the trade paperback.

97
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,660
Scott: Oh, this wasn't hardcover.

98
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,600
Scott: Now it's softcover.

99
00:06:04,681 --> 00:06:06,136
Scott: That's when I was waiting for it.

100
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:15,620
Scott: Includes many stories written by fans that are, they're not necessarily, I guess they count as fanfiction, right?

101
00:06:15,721 --> 00:06:16,277
Rym: They're not canon.

102
00:06:17,722 --> 00:06:29,840
Scott: I think they are canon, and that they all are sort of either zooming in on parts of the story that the original didn't go into great detail on.

103
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,780
Scott: So there would be like, you know, what was this character doing?

104
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,640
Scott: You know, there's like one page, this person was doing something, right?

105
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:45,019
Scott: And it's like, you know, or I think one of them was like, oh, a granddaughter finds diaries and learns stuff, right?

106
00:06:46,362 --> 00:06:49,119
Scott: About the, you know, the women, right?

107
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,420
Scott: So, yeah, it's written by T. Franklin.

108
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,676
Scott: And they think the artist was Jen St.

109
00:06:55,978 --> 00:06:56,079
Scott: Onge.

110
00:06:56,301 --> 00:06:58,120
Scott: I'm sorry if I mispronounced that last name.

111
00:06:58,341 --> 00:06:59,935
Scott: It's S-T hyphen O-N-G-E.

112
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:02,979
Scott: The colors are by Joyce Ann.

113
00:07:04,321 --> 00:07:08,600
Scott: Yeah, if you want to read some awesome gay romance book.

114
00:07:09,121 --> 00:07:09,678
Scott: The art's pretty good.

115
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,718
Rym: I'm flipping through this.

116
00:07:11,602 --> 00:07:14,259
Scott: It's pretty A+ and you can read it really quickly.

117
00:07:15,664 --> 00:07:16,920
Scott: And it's a lot of fun too, right?

118
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:26,060
Scott: It's not just like, you know, a lot of times, you know, people, I think especially people who don't actually, you know, read a lot of romance stuff.

119
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:32,360
Scott: They think, you know, you see something like this, you think it's going to be all serious or, and it is part of it is serious, right?

120
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,840
Scott: But it's actually, it's not entirely serious.

121
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,340
Scott: It's plenty funny, you know, and it's still a comic book, right?

122
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,159
Scott: You still got comic book stuff going on in here.

123
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,800
Scott: So, and it's just one volume and it's now a trade paperback.

124
00:07:44,502 --> 00:07:45,877
Scott: I don't think you can go wrong with this.

125
00:07:46,561 --> 00:07:52,580
Scott: Lend it to everyone, you know, is the Kickstarter was funded in like, I think like a couple of days or something like that.

126
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,433
Scott: It was so popular.

127
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:54,520
Rym: Oh yeah.

128
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,660
Rym: Back in 2017.

129
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:04,180
Scott: It's an, it's a, it just took a while for like, you know, image to pick it up and then publish the jackpot edition and then publish the jackpot edition and soft cover.

130
00:08:04,281 --> 00:08:05,919
Scott: So it's like, now you can get the book, right?

131
00:08:06,721 --> 00:08:08,719
Scott: Um, and you don't have to have some hardcover thing.

132
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,399
Rym: Maybe I should borrow this from you and read it.

133
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:11,419
Scott: All right.

134
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,659
Scott: Coming where you can come and get it without getting disease.

135
00:08:14,622 --> 00:08:19,020
Rym: We got to do like a blind drop, you know, actually that's just a total aside.

136
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:25,596
Rym: I don't know like the term for it or anything, but there was a type of trading that has been practiced in many parts of the world.

137
00:08:25,896 --> 00:08:27,300
Scott: that was, you know, caching spoke.

138
00:08:27,621 --> 00:08:35,938
Rym: It was trading in olden times specifically to trade goods while avoiding plagues between like communities that generally don't interact often.

139
00:08:37,301 --> 00:08:43,620
Rym: Where like one group would leave goods out and leave and another group would come, they take the goods they wanted, they'd leave payments, they'd leave.

140
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,519
Rym: The first group would come.

141
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,300
Scott: And obviously that requires how you exchange money for hostages.

142
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:58,980
Rym: Uh, yeah, it's probably the same thing, I guess, except there's, you have to, like, I guess you have to trust each other a lot more because with the hostage, no third parties come along and take all the stuff.

143
00:08:59,241 --> 00:09:00,600
Rym: That would have, that would be a good story.

144
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:09,820
Rym: The pirates and all they do is find those bazaars and rob them in between and then let them, and then convince the two parties that they're fighting with each other and just slip away.

145
00:09:12,387 --> 00:09:12,900
Rym: All right.

146
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:13,109
Rym: Yeah.

147
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:22,580
Rym: So in some other really brief news, if you didn't notice, uh, I'm making this news partly because there's so many online cons, but people aren't really going to them that often.

148
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,780
Scott: You just can't stop talking about the online cons.

149
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,214
Scott: Can you?

150
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,880
Rym: No, I'm saying, well, I don't have any other news.

151
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,420
Rym: You got any news?

152
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,900
Scott: I feel like we've said or anything there is to say about that.

153
00:09:30,183 --> 00:09:31,279
Rym: We even did a show on it.

154
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,589
Rym: I just want to point out that the crunchy roll.

155
00:09:34,729 --> 00:09:38,320
Rym: online expo is actually happening like in two days.

156
00:09:38,422 --> 00:09:39,320
Rym: It is this weekend.

157
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:40,260
Scott: Yep.

158
00:09:40,521 --> 00:09:41,660
Rym: There is a whole online con.

159
00:09:41,846 --> 00:09:42,259
Rym: It's free.

160
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,259
Rym: You don't have to pay anything.

161
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,680
Rym: Uh, you basically go and register and you'll ever attend.

162
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,020
Rym: Yeah.

163
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:54,960
Rym: Just like go to their website and you register for a badge and they give you like this badge and it tells you how to access all their stuff and there's a schedule, the whole ass con in there.

164
00:09:55,741 --> 00:09:58,260
Scott: So, uh, yeah, not a half ass con, a whole ass con.

165
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,160
Rym: I mean, there are definitely some half ass online cons.

166
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,320
Rym: They're at least trying to make this a whole ass con.

167
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,478
Rym: They got some legit guests.

168
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:13,020
Rym: So if you've been missing all those online cons and you're interested in anime, this is probably the one to check out because hopefully you listen to this episode before the con happened.

169
00:10:13,341 --> 00:10:16,900
Rym: As opposed to how most people go, we're like, Oh, wasn't there going to be some sort of anime con?

170
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,159
Rym: Oh yeah, it was two weeks ago, I guess.

171
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:23,560
Rym: Oh, well, that seems to be like the story that goes for most of these online cons.

172
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:24,760
Scott: Yep.

173
00:10:26,662 --> 00:10:29,179
Scott: I just don't have that much anything new to say about the online con.

174
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,880
Rym: Other than that, I think I might actually do some stuff at this con.

175
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,920
Rym: I think I watch a few panels.

176
00:10:35,241 --> 00:10:39,800
Scott: There's some decent- If I remember to, I will, I put a reminder of when our panel is, so I'm going to at least do that.

177
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,160
Rym: And there's, yeah, we'll, we'll like either live tweet or answer questions.

178
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:53,620
Rym: We'll figure out, we'll be accessible online during our panel to like answer questions or, uh, argue with you when you have a really stupid opinion and you really liked that titty anime that we made fun of.

179
00:10:54,385 --> 00:10:56,340
Scott: I guess the thing is when you're at a con, right?

180
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,759
Scott: You're sort of like, all right, I'm here.

181
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,179
Scott: I'm going to get my time and I put effort to get here.

182
00:11:00,921 --> 00:11:02,159
Scott: I spent money to get here.

183
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,440
Scott: I'm going to get my money's worth.

184
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,280
Scott: My job's worth.

185
00:11:04,621 --> 00:11:07,480
Scott: You look at the schedule, you make a schedule, you stick to it.

186
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,819
Scott: You try to get, you try to squeeze entertainment at it.

187
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,059
Rym: You go to things you might not otherwise go to.

188
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,080
Rym: That's an important part.

189
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,178
Scott: Yeah, of course.

190
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:19,940
Scott: But if I'm at home, I'm not captive by that con, especially if it's a free one, like this Crunchyroll Expo.

191
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:31,980
Scott: So if I'm not a captive to it, it's like, if I don't, like, I could go through the schedule and like add stuff to my schedule, but if I don't feel like it, I'll just do something else.

192
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:32,498
Scott: I'm at home.

193
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,100
Scott: I didn't, I'm not losing anything.

194
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:40,400
Rym: If I don't, I won't pretend when I'm at a con that there aren't some panels I go to because no one's ready to play a game right now.

195
00:11:40,703 --> 00:11:41,718
Rym: I've got an hour to kill.

196
00:11:42,143 --> 00:11:43,179
Rym: It's not a good time to eat.

197
00:11:43,582 --> 00:11:45,699
Rym: I'll go to that panel that looked like it might be okay.

198
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:46,620
Scott: Yeah.

199
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,300
Scott: It's like, you know, a GDQ, for example, I look at the schedule.

200
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:53,820
Scott: I've marked out which ones I kind of want to check out, but it's like, yeah, if I miss them, I miss them.

201
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,660
Scott: I don't care.

202
00:11:54,820 --> 00:12:01,260
Scott: I don't, you know, if I, it's like, I'll just watch the VOD or something, or if they didn't even have the VOD, I would still wouldn't be that upset about it.

203
00:12:01,585 --> 00:12:01,776
Scott: Yeah.

204
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:06,540
Scott: I, I could just go find the person who does that speed run and watch them on Twitch or something.

205
00:12:06,561 --> 00:12:06,668
Scott: Right.

206
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:10,760
Scott: It's like, you know, if I miss a panel at a con and it's never, there's no video of it ever.

207
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:16,560
Scott: It's like, I can find that information if I really needed to find the person who did the panel, something, right.

208
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,840
Scott: It's not the end of the world.

209
00:12:17,921 --> 00:12:19,399
Scott: I've missed a lot of panels in my day.

210
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,520
Rym: Oh, so there's one.

211
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,560
Rym: I was just flipping through the schedule.

212
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,579
Rym: There's one I saw.

213
00:12:22,962 --> 00:12:24,820
Rym: I don't want to go to it, but it just, it's interesting.

214
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:32,380
Rym: Uh, you know, often at anime concert, we used to go, we would run the, how to run an anime club panel because that's someone else is doing it.

215
00:12:32,462 --> 00:12:32,616
Scott: Okay.

216
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,640
Rym: Someone else is doing it here.

217
00:12:33,863 --> 00:12:34,419
Rym: You know who it is?

218
00:12:34,763 --> 00:12:36,020
Rym: It's our friends at UC Davis.

219
00:12:36,201 --> 00:12:39,160
Rym: That was the other like big anime club that we would talk to sometimes.

220
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:39,427
Scott: Yeah.

221
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:43,980
Scott: They would, uh, definitely, I remember contact them contacting us more than one time.

222
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:50,020
Rym: They contacted us once or twice with like collaboration ideas and they contacted us once to warn us about that one thing.

223
00:12:52,386 --> 00:12:53,000
Scott: Oh, right.

224
00:12:54,165 --> 00:12:54,798
Scott: That was them.

225
00:12:55,161 --> 00:12:55,578
Rym: That was them.

226
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,999
Rym: They warned us about that thing.

227
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,240
Rym: And then, and we, uh, we didn't take their warning seriously.

228
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,640
Rym: And then the thing happened and it was, we did take their warning somewhat seriously.

229
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,080
Rym: Well, I took it seriously.

230
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:05,766
Scott: It wasn't like that.

231
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:06,759
Scott: much we could do about it.

232
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:12,639
Rym: The moment I saw the individual in question and my brain said, I'll bet that's him.

233
00:13:22,242 --> 00:13:24,840
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

234
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,578
Rym: So check this out.

235
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:43,380
Rym: There's been a lot of movement lately in AI rendering, like using neural networks and machine learning to either accelerate like rendering, like taking a project, like a video game, you know, a video card renders the things you're supposed to see and put some on the screen or rendering streaming video in real time.

236
00:13:43,521 --> 00:13:46,140
Rym: And maybe you got to like get this 4k stream out there or something.

237
00:13:46,660 --> 00:14:08,540
Rym: So there's been a lot of advancements recently in using AI to do that sort of thing, to take something that needs to be encoded or rendered and render it faster because the AI will maybe figure out efficient or clever ways to achieve the intent, even though it might not necessarily render exactly what the algorithm someone would have normally used would have rendered like that.

238
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,131
Scott: Yeah.

239
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:29,180
Scott: I mean, we're using this a lot at the most, I guess, you know, the biggest use of machine learning these days is like image recognition technology is definitely one of the most advanced, you know, use cases for machine learning, but very closely related to that, you know, is, you know, prediction, right?

240
00:14:29,281 --> 00:14:32,580
Scott: So you look at like, you know, deep fakes and stuff, right?

241
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:37,500
Scott: It's like, it's basically almost the same, the same kind of code does both things, right?

242
00:14:37,822 --> 00:14:39,780
Scott: It's like, pick a face out of a picture.

243
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Scott: Well, now I can put a face in a picture, right?

244
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:42,340
Scott: I can.

245
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,120
Scott: Right.

246
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,780
Scott: So that same stuff can now be used to animate.

247
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,080
Scott: It's like, okay, I drew two frames, right?

248
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,360
Scott: We already have just straight up interpolation that people use.

249
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,860
Rym: Yeah, but that tends to make that very like linear, like it looks cheap animation.

250
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,817
Scott: People use just straight up interpolation to make like a 30 FPS video into a 60 FPS.

251
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,919
Rym: And they just look weird at best.

252
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:06,560
Scott: Yeah, by just calculating the in between frames, just like by averages.

253
00:15:06,701 --> 00:15:10,880
Rym: But what if an AI was like, oh, that is an object moving downward.

254
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,680
Rym: It should accelerate more like that kind of thing could happen.

255
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,219
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

256
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:20,560
Scott: So you could use that same technology to like in between some animations.

257
00:15:20,741 --> 00:15:23,378
Scott: There's no technological reason that you couldn't.

258
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,900
Scott: And if it was good enough, it would look as good as deep fakes look, right?

259
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:32,040
Scott: At least given modern computing power and such.

260
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:32,511
Rym: Oh, no.

261
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:40,500
Rym: So my thing of the day, I was not going to talk about the algorithm and just talk about the thing, but I learned the name of the of the thing of the thing.

262
00:15:40,721 --> 00:15:42,056
Rym: And now I have to talk about this.

263
00:15:43,069 --> 00:15:43,420
Rym: God damn.

264
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:49,900
Rym: So basically, you know, those old Fleischer Studios Superman cartoons that were like rotoscoped and I just watched.

265
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,079
Scott: I just watched one the other day.

266
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:54,180
Rym: They're like, they're really like high quality animation.

267
00:15:54,301 --> 00:15:58,040
Rym: Like those things look great, but they're old too.

268
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,455
Rym: This is from like the forties.

269
00:16:00,342 --> 00:16:05,100
Rym: So this YouTuber took one of the episodes from that.

270
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:05,618
Scott: The bullet.

271
00:16:05,701 --> 00:16:07,420
Scott: This is the thing I watched the other day.

272
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:07,999
Scott: I watched this.

273
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,639
Rym: Oh, this is why you watch the bullet tears.

274
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,400
Rym: OK, OK, that's good.

275
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:11,978
Rym: So you've seen this.

276
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:27,960
Rym: So they used an upscaler that is called waifu 2x, which is basically a convolutional neural network thing that was trained on anime, just like contemporary anime.

277
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:36,620
Rym: And they just applied it with some constraints to one of like the highest quality video we had of one of these old Fleischer Brothers cartoons.

278
00:16:38,403 --> 00:16:43,380
Scott: And they chose it, by the way, because it's in the public domain, even though Superman, the character is not necessary.

279
00:16:43,621 --> 00:16:44,098
Scott: This is just free.

280
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,639
Rym: I made this video, the original Superman.

281
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:57,320
Rym: So they upscaled this old thing to 4K and holy shit, like it just looks better.

282
00:16:57,703 --> 00:16:59,979
Rym: There's been two ads detail that was not there.

283
00:17:00,321 --> 00:17:03,660
Rym: And the detail makes sense, is consistent, is aesthetic.

284
00:17:04,262 --> 00:17:06,180
Rym: It's kind of amazing.

285
00:17:06,904 --> 00:17:08,119
Scott: It's also a really good cartoon.

286
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,480
Rym: It is a really good cartoon.

287
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:18,260
Rym: I love the concept, but like the the villain in this one episode, their superpower or their tool is just amazing.

288
00:17:19,461 --> 00:17:20,546
Scott: Also, it's just.

289
00:17:20,586 --> 00:17:23,338
Rym: it's a car that Rams shit, but it's really just a fighter jet.

290
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:24,155
Rym: that Rams shit.

291
00:17:24,821 --> 00:17:25,204
Scott: It's also.

292
00:17:25,243 --> 00:17:28,840
Scott: I love those old ones because it's still jumping Superman and not flying Superman.

293
00:17:29,861 --> 00:17:31,952
Rym: Also, it's got like this is the kind of aesthetic like.

294
00:17:31,972 --> 00:17:33,919
Rym: this is the same reason why I like BTS so much.

295
00:17:34,001 --> 00:17:35,399
Rym: Like it's a striking aesthetic.

296
00:17:37,103 --> 00:17:37,339
Scott: Oh, yeah.

297
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:37,837
Scott: It's art deco.

298
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:38,210
Scott: Yeah.

299
00:17:38,901 --> 00:17:40,099
Rym: So check this out.

300
00:17:40,301 --> 00:17:42,157
Rym: Like you can watch my thing of the day.

301
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,519
Rym: The page is great.

302
00:17:43,781 --> 00:17:46,600
Rym: It has a YouTube video of the original and YouTube video of the upscaled one.

303
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:53,260
Rym: And it's just kind of amazing how good this algorithm was at making this look better.

304
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:55,379
Scott: So what do you got?

305
00:17:56,421 --> 00:18:05,000
Scott: So 14 years ago, when GeekNights wasn't even like a year old guy, Liam Kyle Sullivan uploaded a famous video music video to the Internet.

306
00:18:05,441 --> 00:18:05,898
Scott: Oh, my God.

307
00:18:06,384 --> 00:18:07,040
Scott: She's right.

308
00:18:07,802 --> 00:18:10,879
Scott: And that was a thing of the day in 2006 when it was brand new.

309
00:18:11,781 --> 00:18:16,659
Scott: And just like GeekNights has refused to die, Liam Kyle Sullivan is still at it.

310
00:18:16,841 --> 00:18:17,299
Scott: Oh, my God.

311
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,000
Rym: I'm scrolling through their upload history.

312
00:18:19,481 --> 00:18:20,999
Rym: Yeah, there's a lot there.

313
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:33,359
Scott: And just yesterday's 2020, Liam released a new video masks, which is so this isn't like someone else taking this.

314
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:33,857
Scott: Oh, my God.

315
00:18:34,061 --> 00:18:35,559
Scott: Shoes and switching it to masks.

316
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:40,160
Scott: This is the original person doing it to themselves before you watch.

317
00:18:40,402 --> 00:18:40,738
Scott: Oh, my God.

318
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,278
Scott: Masks.

319
00:18:41,844 --> 00:18:43,279
Rym: You should really watch shoes.

320
00:18:43,621 --> 00:18:46,200
Scott: You should rewatch or watch for the first time.

321
00:18:46,301 --> 00:18:46,617
Scott: Oh, my God.

322
00:18:46,782 --> 00:18:46,889
Scott: Shoes.

323
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,060
Rym: It's easy to find the first video on their channel, right?

324
00:18:50,321 --> 00:18:52,533
Scott: I think this actually there's a more recent.

325
00:18:52,593 --> 00:18:53,478
Scott: I think they did an HD.

326
00:18:54,221 --> 00:18:56,058
Rym: They did a full version, too.

327
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,440
Scott: Yeah, there's an HD remaster of shoes.

328
00:18:58,741 --> 00:19:08,218
Scott: But you can see that many of the things from the original shoes video managed to make a comeback like the guy in the purple costume and such.

329
00:19:09,141 --> 00:19:19,420
Scott: It's like 14 years later, Liam managed to get those people, you know, to reprise their roles as necessary for a tale for the present times.

330
00:19:19,862 --> 00:19:23,399
Scott: So, yeah, Liam still do a good work out there.

331
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:27,640
Scott: I hope 14 years from now, Liam puts out another great music video.

332
00:19:27,962 --> 00:19:28,028
Rym: Yep.

333
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:39,159
Rym: I always enjoy when I find this has been a trend with us, you and me, like just not an Internet trend, just us where we'll find like a YouTube channel that does something that really, really like works for us.

334
00:19:39,862 --> 00:19:43,360
Rym: And then we discover that that channel just keeps making that exact same thing.

335
00:19:46,082 --> 00:19:51,219
Rym: I do remember the one that was that it was like Zelda characters licking each other with the weird tongues.

336
00:19:52,466 --> 00:19:52,997
Scott: Yeah, that's you.

337
00:19:54,387 --> 00:19:56,039
Rym: Yeah, I recall you laughing at that.

338
00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:00,960
Rym: I think you're the one who showed that to me, not the other way around.

339
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,598
Rym: I don't know what Lincoln video you're thinking of.

340
00:20:04,023 --> 00:20:06,559
Rym: I remember this is not Pokemon master sex.

341
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:13,940
Scott: No, oh, yeah, I guess that's just just a tiny note of the Pokemon master sex.

342
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:19,322
Scott: So we should explain that there was some Pokemon thing that got released recently that was called.

343
00:20:19,864 --> 00:20:24,139
Scott: the actual name of it was Pokemon Masters EX.

344
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:31,460
Scott: This is a pan island situation, sort of like F zero G X. Yeah, it's Pokemon Masters EX.

345
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,095
Scott: But obviously you take the S off the end of the word master and now it's Pokemon master sex.

346
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,139
Scott: And that became a Twitter hashtag.

347
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:43,080
Scott: Go to Twitter and type hashtag Pokemon master sex and you will see some amazing tweets.

348
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:43,355
Rym: Yep.

349
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:48,800
Rym: So I would say it's one third really funny tweets, two thirds horny tweets.

350
00:20:49,521 --> 00:20:56,420
Rym: But of the horny tweets, it felt like it was one third Pokemon character like sexy stuff.

351
00:20:56,761 --> 00:21:00,050
Rym: And the other third was Pokemon characters with Pokemon sexy stuff.

352
00:21:01,061 --> 00:21:05,360
Rym: Yeah, that hashtag was that was a trip.

353
00:21:06,025 --> 00:21:06,779
Rym: And we'll leave it at that.

354
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,759
Rym: You can go look for this yourself if you want.

355
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:11,020
Rym: All right.

356
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,000
Rym: So we left plenty of time for the actual main bit in this show.

357
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:14,880
Rym: But first, I'm at a moment.

358
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,696
Rym: Of course, we are going to be live at the Crunchyroll Expo doing judge anime by its cover.

359
00:21:18,981 --> 00:21:23,280
Rym: We talk about some anime that we had not seen since we recorded this.

360
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:28,879
Rym: I have actually looked at some of the shows we reviewed and we were pretty spot on.

361
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:32,340
Rym: Well, those shows were exactly what we said they were going to be like.

362
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,799
Rym: I don't think we are who we thought they were.

363
00:21:36,381 --> 00:21:40,600
Rym: So Friday, like in a couple of days on the stage at seven thirty p.m.

364
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:44,560
Rym: Eastern Daylight Time, we will be presenting judge anime by its cover.

365
00:21:46,023 --> 00:21:47,680
Rym: We'll probably put it up on YouTube somewhere later.

366
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:51,100
Rym: But for now, the only way to see it is to go to the free Crunchyroll Expo.

367
00:21:52,761 --> 00:22:00,660
Scott: And of course, so have officially are on the now public schedule of PAX online, which is going to be a week long.

368
00:22:01,461 --> 00:22:08,260
Scott: It's not only going to be a week long across three Twitch channels, but it's covering and West together combined.

369
00:22:08,722 --> 00:22:11,840
Scott: So depending on what you look at the schedule, don't be confused.

370
00:22:12,482 --> 00:22:17,140
Scott: At the top of the schedule, it's like late at night and like and it's showing you the Australian content.

371
00:22:17,242 --> 00:22:17,939
Scott: You scroll down.

372
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,340
Scott: There'll be like a gap while everyone's sleeping and then there'll be the PAX West content.

373
00:22:22,762 --> 00:22:25,837
Scott: And so basically it's like so many days long and 24 hours.

374
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,220
Scott: The content isn't running constantly.

375
00:22:28,662 --> 00:22:36,819
Scott: For example, our panel is in packs the third channel, but that doesn't appear to yet be any content on the schedule and the other two channels at the same time as us.

376
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,400
Rym: Maybe that'll change.

377
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,199
Rym: Like, you know, cons go like we used to run.

378
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:40,979
Scott: Yeah, of course.

379
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:45,140
Scott: I'm sure the schedule isn't final, but there is a lot of content on there.

380
00:22:45,501 --> 00:22:47,850
Scott: It's just because it's so many days and 24/7, it's not 100% full.

381
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:50,435
Rym: Yeah.

382
00:22:50,721 --> 00:22:52,589
Rym: And they'll be gaming and stuff like if nothing else.

383
00:22:52,669 --> 00:22:57,560
Rym: during this packs, Scott and I and a bunch of our friends, the crew we normally go to PAX is with.

384
00:22:58,022 --> 00:23:00,760
Rym: We're going to be online, like looking for people to just play games with.

385
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:05,039
Rym: If you want to play Rude, get into some tabletop simulator, play some Overwatch with me.

386
00:23:06,281 --> 00:23:11,300
Rym: I'm going to take some days off, be playing some games, and I will gladly play games with random people on the internet.

387
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,939
Scott: Yeah, as long as depending on what game it is, sure.

388
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,719
Rym: Yeah, you want to play some Overwatch with us?

389
00:23:15,901 --> 00:23:16,358
Rym: You want to try it?

390
00:23:16,641 --> 00:23:17,752
Scott: I will also repeat my offer.

391
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:25,260
Scott: Anyone who wants to learn to play 18XX, I will give you free personal lessons on how to play train games.

392
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:25,880
Rym: He's not kidding.

393
00:23:25,981 --> 00:23:26,479
Rym: He's done it.

394
00:23:26,581 --> 00:23:27,319
Rym: I watched him do it.

395
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:27,759
Rym: It was great.

396
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,617
Rym: And then we played a game.

397
00:23:29,881 --> 00:23:35,079
Rym: The listeners, we've actually now we've been playing this game with the listener quite a bit and the listeners are getting better and better.

398
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,900
Scott: Yeah, you could be the other listener.

399
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,919
Rym: Yeah, we could have two listeners playing the game.

400
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,480
Scott: If we get five listeners, they could play with themselves.

401
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,480
Rym: You don't need to play with them.

402
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,400
Rym: And then our mission is complete.

403
00:23:44,962 --> 00:23:45,047
Scott: Yeah.

404
00:23:45,601 --> 00:23:47,360
Rym: I'm feeling this 1882.

405
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,589
Rym: I was skimming through the rules of it.

406
00:23:49,385 --> 00:23:49,940
Scott: No, whatever.

407
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:55,020
Rym: There could be a different number of one of the trains, like an extra two or an extra four.

408
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:55,840
Scott: All right.

409
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:02,819
Scott: The book called Book is still the Tale of Genji, the first novel that was ever written by human beings.

410
00:24:03,721 --> 00:24:06,513
Scott: We still are going to continue reading it at some point.

411
00:24:06,553 --> 00:24:09,158
Scott: when we read again, which is I don't know when that will be.

412
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:14,880
Rym: I think when it might be is when it is too cold for us to do long bike trips.

413
00:24:15,962 --> 00:24:19,280
Rym: We'll be inside and we might actually like sit and read.

414
00:24:20,228 --> 00:24:20,460
Scott: Maybe.

415
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,258
Rym: Or we might be working on another secret project.

416
00:24:23,761 --> 00:24:24,179
Scott: So stay tuned.

417
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:24,636
Scott: Who knows?

418
00:24:25,683 --> 00:24:26,473
Scott: Who knows what I have?

419
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,160
Rym: I read the first bit of it.

420
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:28,919
Rym: I was going to keep reading.

421
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,179
Rym: I do want to read it.

422
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,498
Rym: I enjoyed what I read so far.

423
00:24:32,161 --> 00:24:32,798
Rym: Just don't have time.

424
00:24:33,621 --> 00:24:34,264
Scott: Yeah, I think it's.

425
00:24:34,284 --> 00:24:40,020
Scott: I think there's this thing people seem to think that, like, like somehow some people like just give up on this book and change books.

426
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,980
Scott: And I'm like, I got no problem doing that.

427
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:46,719
Scott: If we somehow pick a book that I didn't realize was garbage and we start reading it and it's just like, you know what?

428
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,160
Scott: Unpick.

429
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,299
Scott: I got no problem doing that, even though we haven't done it.

430
00:24:49,644 --> 00:24:50,260
Scott: I got no problem.

431
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,319
Rym: But I want to read this.

432
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,899
Rym: If we pick a different book, I would be.

433
00:24:53,403 --> 00:24:56,120
Rym: We haven't read the three body problem yet.

434
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,039
Scott: Yeah, it could have been any book.

435
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,760
Scott: It was just the timing of the book that was selected.

436
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,338
Scott: Not the not the book.

437
00:25:03,407 --> 00:25:05,139
Rym: You know, you blame blame the coronavirus.

438
00:25:06,011 --> 00:25:06,200
Scott: Yep.

439
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,820
Rym: Because I'm not on the subway reading a book like I normally would.

440
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:13,480
Scott: Granted, people were saying that, you know, just give up on it before the virus.

441
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,620
Scott: Yeah, but if it wasn't for the virus, I think I would have finished reading this.

442
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,337
Rym: Oh, definitely.

443
00:25:18,721 --> 00:25:24,596
Rym: Also, I would have had like five or six international flights in the time that we have been stuck at home.

444
00:25:24,903 --> 00:25:26,239
Rym: So I definitely would have cranked this out.

445
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:32,970
Scott: Like I would have had many sit, you know, go sit in the park despite it being crowded because there isn't a plague situations.

446
00:25:36,229 --> 00:25:36,620
Rym: All right.

447
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:41,179
Scott: I would have had many bikes somewhere and take a train home and read on the train home situation.

448
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:41,570
Rym: Yeah.

449
00:25:42,862 --> 00:25:45,300
Rym: In fact, I probably would have read if we hadn't finished it somehow.

450
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,500
Rym: I probably would have read it on the flight to Seattle.

451
00:25:48,564 --> 00:25:49,280
Scott: Yep, probably.

452
00:25:49,841 --> 00:25:50,456
Rym: But here we are.

453
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:57,960
Rym: So otherwise, like Google for GeekNights, find our Discord, our forum, Scott's YouTube channel, my YouTube channel, us at these conventions.

454
00:25:58,342 --> 00:25:59,199
Rym: We're in a lot of places.

455
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:04,620
Rym: We're making stuff and we've set up pipelines to make things more efficiently during this long running crisis.

456
00:26:04,761 --> 00:26:07,000
Rym: So hopefully you'll start seeing more fruits of that labor.

457
00:26:07,462 --> 00:26:10,497
Rym: But also we're doing a lot of low tier, low effort stuff.

458
00:26:10,517 --> 00:26:11,100
Rym: that's just fun.

459
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:16,720
Rym: Like sometimes in the Discord, Scott will just stream a game he's playing or I'll just stream like some random thing I'm working on.

460
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:24,299
Scott: Yeah, lately these days on my Twitch channel, since I got the old bike trainer and I'm biking to nowhere, just biking in my apartment going nowhere.

461
00:26:25,341 --> 00:26:29,478
Scott: But I got this little game that goes with it called Zwift, which is like the little bike training game.

462
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,274
Scott: And I've been doing that like more than every other day.

463
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:45,831
Scott: And then I set it up so it's very easy for me and low effort to stream it on Twitch, which is not really so much about you watching me bike to nowhere, even though you can do that.

464
00:26:46,281 --> 00:26:53,640
Scott: It's more about like, hey, I'm doing nothing and I can chat with people on like, you know, I tried streaming other video games like Paper Mario.

465
00:26:53,782 --> 00:26:55,260
Rym: That's why I stopped that Xcom stream.

466
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:59,600
Rym: That's a lot of effort to keep that energy up for like, it's hard to chat.

467
00:27:00,221 --> 00:27:07,140
Scott: It's hard to chat with people and play the game and focus on the game and get enjoyment out of the game while chatting like it doesn't work too well.

468
00:27:07,541 --> 00:27:11,300
Scott: But just biking in place like I kind of need someone to chat with.

469
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:16,532
Scott: So the streaming part is more like, hey, you know, come chat with if you want to just chat with me.

470
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,260
Scott: Wait, go look at follow my Twitch channel.

471
00:27:19,821 --> 00:27:25,100
Scott: And then, you know, you'll see a notification like he's going live on bike.

472
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,698
Scott: You'll see me bike in there, but you can just chat with me.

473
00:27:28,223 --> 00:27:28,798
Scott: And that I don't know.

474
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,859
Scott: I'm not looking for a lot of viewers.

475
00:27:30,001 --> 00:27:33,000
Scott: I just need like one person to be like, hey, what you do?

476
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,239
Scott: It doesn't have to be about bikes.

477
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,259
Scott: I'll chat about whatever.

478
00:27:36,725 --> 00:27:37,680
Rym: What you doing?

479
00:27:38,201 --> 00:27:39,199
Scott: Yeah, that's going to get a ban.

480
00:27:41,542 --> 00:27:43,459
Scott: Don't make me get off the bike and have to click the ban.

481
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:46,260
Rym: All right.

482
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:54,060
Rym: So this is a show that is very broad because we're covering a huge area.

483
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,080
Rym: The concept of the Spider-Man.

484
00:27:57,481 --> 00:28:01,800
Scott: So, you know, I don't want to just like start a series of shows on like underwear.

485
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,300
Scott: Don't worry.

486
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:02,957
Rym: We're not next.

487
00:28:03,402 --> 00:28:04,960
Rym: Two weeks from now is not Batman.

488
00:28:06,087 --> 00:28:06,738
Scott: For sure it isn't.

489
00:28:08,182 --> 00:28:14,456
Scott: No, but Spider-Man is like, you know, obviously a legendary iconic world famous hero, right?

490
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:19,899
Scott: That means many things to different people has a long history, right?

491
00:28:19,899 --> 00:28:24,100
Rym: 1962 to today, pretty much nonstop.

492
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,540
Scott: So I think like, no matter who you are at this point in the world, right?

493
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:36,817
Scott: It's like, uh, you know, I think most people in some way have, at least depending on where you live, right?

494
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:45,719
Scott: At least, especially where we live in the English speaking world, but also the not English speaking world, the Spider-Man has touched your life in some way and not in an inappropriate way.

495
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:45,953
Rym: Yeah.

496
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,000
Rym: Not the Spider-Man experience in Wildwood.

497
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,114
Scott: No, not that.

498
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:55,019
Rym: There's, there's this old, there was this old like rundown amusement ride.

499
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:57,120
Rym: that like wasn't admin active for decades.

500
00:28:57,582 --> 00:29:07,176
Rym: But so imagine seeing this like dilapidated trailer looking thing and there's a broken down sign that literally just says the Spider-Man experience and points at this boarded up door.

501
00:29:08,201 --> 00:29:24,420
Scott: So I feel like, you know, and I, you know, a lot of, uh, you know, superhero academic people always try to go down this angle, but I don't think it's wrong to do so as they talk about some of the legendary superhero stuff as being just like, you know, the same way you would talk about like, you know, Greek mythology, right?

502
00:29:24,645 --> 00:29:24,776
Scott: Yeah.

503
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:32,740
Rym: It's like, you know, I think it's fair, like any random person I talked to, like, I assume they have a passing knowledge of Hercules.

504
00:29:32,901 --> 00:29:42,840
Rym: Like if I referenced Hercules in any conversation I have with pretty much anyone, I expect that they would at least recognize, Oh, that big strong Greek guy who did some stuff like that.

505
00:29:43,122 --> 00:29:45,039
Rym: If they got that far, that's enough.

506
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,960
Rym: Spider-Man's really the same way.

507
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:51,220
Rym: Like I assume anyone I talked to is, is familiar on some level with Spider-Man.

508
00:29:52,021 --> 00:29:54,500
Scott: But also I imagine if you were in ancient Greece, right?

509
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,480
Scott: It's like Hercules means something to you, right?

510
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,640
Scott: It has like relevance to your life, right?

511
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:06,718
Scott: Like you could ask if you could speak ancient Greek and talk, go to Athens, you could say, Hey, what is, uh, what does Zeus mean to you?

512
00:30:08,002 --> 00:30:10,600
Scott: And just about everyone would have some kind of answer, right?

513
00:30:10,721 --> 00:30:17,780
Scott: Of how the story of Zeus, the fiction, the mythology of it has some relevance to their life or meaning to them positively or negatively.

514
00:30:18,463 --> 00:30:18,580
Scott: Right.

515
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:20,520
Scott: So, yeah.

516
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,638
Scott: So of course, Spider-Man means something to us.

517
00:30:25,064 --> 00:30:27,420
Rym: You know, all I can imagine is like, if you're in Athens, better watch out.

518
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,598
Rym: Diogenes might argue with you and then piss on you.

519
00:30:31,301 --> 00:30:37,100
Scott: So for me, Spider-Man is like, compared to all the other superheroes, I just feel like.

520
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:40,480
Scott: there's a lot, you know, people always say like they identify with, right?

521
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,760
Scott: But it's like, I don't really identify with, I don't feel like I am Spider-Man.

522
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,620
Rym: You're not reincarnated Spider-Man about to form Spider-Man house?

523
00:30:47,421 --> 00:30:52,640
Scott: No, but there's so many things about Spider-Man that I feel are about me also, right?

524
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,680
Scott: It's like, he's just some nerdy kid, right?

525
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,020
Scott: Obviously I was a nerdy kid.

526
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,038
Scott: I'm now a nerdy old guy.

527
00:30:57,221 --> 00:30:58,400
Rym: Wisecracken New Yorker.

528
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,217
Rym: You got that down.

529
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,480
Scott: New York is big in Spider-Man, right?

530
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,358
Scott: He cares about New York.

531
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,920
Scott: He's from Queens, right?

532
00:31:06,801 --> 00:31:10,280
Scott: I'm not as much from Queens as Spider-Man is, but at least I'm far.

533
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,020
Scott: And that's all, of course, this is only one of the Spider-Mans.

534
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:17,200
Scott: There are many Spider-Mans, which I think is also important, right?

535
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,078
Scott: It's like, oh, there's a Spider-Man who's like me.

536
00:31:19,561 --> 00:31:22,960
Scott: Well, no matter who you are, there's this Spider-Man that's like you.

537
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,220
Scott: They've made so many Spider-Mans.

538
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:28,020
Rym: In fact, the Spider-Verse sort of makes that canonical that there's a Spider-Man for everybody.

539
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:28,837
Scott: Right.

540
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:32,111
Scott: It's like, whatever Spider-Man you are, it's like, yeah, there's one that's you.

541
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,998
Scott: It's like, hey, that's me.

542
00:31:37,185 --> 00:31:38,560
Scott: Only swinging around, right?

543
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,600
Rym: But even when I was a kid, I didn't read a lot of comics.

544
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:56,600
Rym: I didn't get into X-Men or floppy comics until way later elementary school, like early middle school, but I always knew the deal with Spider-Man specifically, way more than any other comic character to the point that I could not say when I encountered Spider-Man.

545
00:31:57,342 --> 00:31:59,820
Scott: No, it's just like you just sort of always knew it existed, right?

546
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,180
Scott: It's like, when did you know Mickey Mouse existed?

547
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,299
Scott: Like it just always did.

548
00:32:04,305 --> 00:32:05,239
Scott: It was just always there.

549
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:09,100
Scott: But you can imagine like old people, like there was a time when Spider-Man didn't exist.

550
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,820
Rym: Well, I got, you know, we're old enough to be like, yeah, I remember when Pokemon came out.

551
00:32:13,823 --> 00:32:15,099
Rym: There was no Pokemon before that.

552
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,259
Rym: That was like, I was in like high school.

553
00:32:16,945 --> 00:32:17,320
Scott: That's right.

554
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:20,840
Scott: Kids today, you know, Pokemon just always been there, right?

555
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:22,799
Rym: You know, I wonder this is a total aside.

556
00:32:23,702 --> 00:32:28,240
Rym: Does Spider-Man or Pikachu have more name recognition among the population of the earth?

557
00:32:29,863 --> 00:32:30,339
Scott: Tough to say.

558
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,540
Rym: I think that would be a real tough race.

559
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,959
Rym: I think that could be real close.

560
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,760
Scott: It used to be that just Mickey Mouse was just like number one by a landslide.

561
00:32:38,782 --> 00:32:41,220
Scott: But now there's several competitors in that arena.

562
00:32:41,904 --> 00:32:42,640
Scott: There's Hello Kitty.

563
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,700
Scott: There's, what's it called?

564
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:49,935
Scott: Obviously, Pikachu, Pokemon, Mario, Sonic.

565
00:32:49,955 --> 00:32:51,060
Scott: the Hedgehog is up there.

566
00:32:51,341 --> 00:32:53,700
Scott: In terms of like, you know, fictional cartoon characters.

567
00:32:53,821 --> 00:32:56,399
Rym: Let's leave out the hell streamers and YouTube shouty men.

568
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,680
Rym: Hopefully they're a flash in the pan.

569
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:01,300
Scott: That are, that have the most recognition worldwide, right?

570
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:05,059
Scott: You know, the Bugs Bunny is still high up there, although less so than it used to be.

571
00:33:05,301 --> 00:33:05,617
Scott: There's a lot.

572
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:13,940
Rym: But I guess I have this weird like memory of always liking Spider-Man before I really even consumed much Spider-Man media.

573
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:19,040
Rym: Like I liked Spider-Man before I read any Spider-Man, but I don't know why.

574
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,440
Rym: I just liked Spider-Man.

575
00:33:20,661 --> 00:33:28,180
Rym: I liked the character and I liked the concept, but there was a time in my life where I felt that way, but I had literally not read a single Spider-Man comic of any kind at any point.

576
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:38,320
Scott: See, for me, it was like, you know, I didn't consider myself, like if you said things you like, like Spider-Man would not come on the list, would not come to mind, right?

577
00:33:38,701 --> 00:33:40,580
Scott: It might not even come to mind if you ask me now.

578
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,840
Scott: Like, what are things you like, Scott?

579
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:43,060
Scott: It's like, I'm not gonna say Spider-Man.

580
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:43,228
Scott: K-Pop.

581
00:33:44,321 --> 00:33:44,673
Scott: Right, yeah.

582
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,457
Scott: That'll come to mind right now, right?

583
00:33:47,041 --> 00:33:55,091
Scott: But the thing is, if I actually go and read a Spider-Man, it's like, oh shit, this stuff is good, right?

584
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,616
Scott: It's like, I'm loving reading this Spider-Man right now, you know?

585
00:34:00,981 --> 00:34:04,980
Scott: When I was a kid, I didn't even read a lot of actual Spider-Man.

586
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,921
Scott: I read Spider-Man 2099.

587
00:34:06,921 --> 00:34:07,157
Scott: Yeah, I know.

588
00:34:07,521 --> 00:34:09,260
Rym: That's why I kept telling you, go see Spider-Verse.

589
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,899
Rym: He's in it and I was not lying.

590
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:11,739
Scott: Not really.

591
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,659
Rym: But I was not lying.

592
00:34:13,481 --> 00:34:18,099
Scott: But yeah, Spider-Man 2099 was cyberpunk plus Spider-Man.

593
00:34:19,261 --> 00:34:26,514
Scott: But the character of, you know, Miguel O'Hara, which is Spider-Man 2099, is just sort of an asshole.

594
00:34:28,121 --> 00:34:30,620
Scott: He's not like a good kid like Peter Parker.

595
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:34,100
Scott: He's just this jerk who gets power.

596
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,855
Scott: His brother's actually a good guy.

597
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:44,179
Rym: I feel like I did see a lot of the old like really low budget Spider-Man cartoon, but that was like kid brain.

598
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:47,255
Scott: Spider-Man and his amazing friends or Spider-Man the 90s one or...

599
00:34:49,684 --> 00:34:51,000
Rym: The 60s like bad one.

600
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,237
Scott: Spider-Man and his amazing friends.

601
00:34:52,481 --> 00:34:53,920
Rym: Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's that one.

602
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:54,940
Scott: Spider-Man, Spider-Man.

603
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:55,858
Rym: That's the one I remember.

604
00:34:57,391 --> 00:34:57,720
Scott: That one?

605
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,318
Rym: I think so.

606
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:02,657
Rym: I think I was interested in that because I'm just trying to think back.

607
00:35:02,717 --> 00:35:16,460
Rym: like these are memories coming as I really strive because when I was really, really, really young, we had to do the entire 2600 and one of the cartridges we had was really colorful compared to the other ones and it was Spider-Man.

608
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:25,760
Rym: And I think I want like my parents would always like when I put that game on, I just have memories of like my parents like, oh, Spider-Man, like they talk about Spider-Man because they read Spider-Man.

609
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,899
Rym: They were like deep into superhero comics and shit.

610
00:35:28,221 --> 00:35:46,058
Rym: So like my uncle and my parents would like talk about Spider-Man a lot and I think I absorbed my fondness for Spider-Man from them and they were only talking about it because I was the little kid playing the Atari and they were adults probably like hanging out and drinking in the room and just like talking about Spider-Man.

611
00:35:47,361 --> 00:35:53,218
Rym: So I wonder if the kids that are like around us at our parties will have like fond memories of the video games that we talked about.

612
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:59,920
Scott: So things about Spider-Man that are cool and I think this applies to all the different, most of the Spider-Man incarnations.

613
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:02,100
Rym: Yeah, we can ignore like the number one exception.

614
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:09,579
Scott: Spider-Man is usually, right, a, you know, he's primarily a journalistic photographer, right?

615
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:16,500
Scott: But he's also been like a teacher or, you know, he's always in some sort of admirable profession, right?

616
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,380
Scott: I guess he's sometimes a high school student.

617
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:23,140
Rym: Yeah, but he's doing good work, trying hard in his real life, irrespective of spider powers.

618
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:27,820
Scott: Which is also, you know, Superman as well is just a journalist straight up, right?

619
00:36:28,302 --> 00:36:33,598
Scott: But, you know, he's always, you know, he's, so he's doing admirable, important work, right?

620
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,098
Scott: Alongside his Spider-Manning.

621
00:36:36,781 --> 00:36:40,680
Scott: But unlike, you know, Superman is a journalist, right?

622
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:45,260
Scott: It's like he goes out and he'll, he's not journalisting while he's Superman, right?

623
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,480
Scott: Lois Lane is journal.

624
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:51,960
Scott: He's, he's sort of creating a scene, making sure Lois Lane sees him so she can write about what he's doing, right?

625
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:59,299
Scott: Spider-Man is like sticking a camera on the wall while he fights a villain to make sure he gets some photos of himself, right?

626
00:36:59,941 --> 00:37:01,799
Scott: So it's sort of a different situation there.

627
00:37:02,801 --> 00:37:12,720
Rym: I, that's, I think what I, one of my favorite bits about Spider-Man in general was like, he had to have a hustle to make it work with the like pictures of Spider-Man thing.

628
00:37:13,832 --> 00:37:13,979
Scott: Yep.

629
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:19,398
Rym: I enjoyed like, it was just portrayed like he has to like get a picture of himself solving this crime.

630
00:37:20,222 --> 00:37:27,458
Scott: I remember in the, uh, there was a, there's a super, uh, Sega Genesis, uh, Spider-Man game.

631
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:28,920
Scott: I think it might just be called Spider-Man.

632
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,080
Scott: It was, it was the first Spider-Man game for the Genesis.

633
00:37:32,581 --> 00:37:36,239
Scott: And what you'd have to do is when you'd get like a boss, like I remember like is Dr.

634
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:40,699
Scott: Octopus fight him, but you take a photo of him first and then you'd fight him, right?

635
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,639
Scott: It had like a button to take photos of stuff.

636
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,498
Scott: That was like part of the thing.

637
00:37:45,382 --> 00:37:52,060
Scott: Um, but also right, uh, much, you know, still relevant today as it was in the sixties.

638
00:37:52,272 --> 00:37:52,379
Scott: Right.

639
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:56,379
Scott: You know, obviously the secret identity was a trope of all superheroes back then.

640
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:57,020
Scott: Right.

641
00:37:57,661 --> 00:38:03,020
Scott: Um, but Spider-Man was, you know, a normal person living a normal life.

642
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:03,619
Scott: Right.

643
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:13,660
Scott: Whereas, you know, you look at some of the other superheroes that ha even if they had secret identities, they didn't necessarily always have a very good reason for them.

644
00:38:14,071 --> 00:38:14,278
Scott: Right.

645
00:38:14,951 --> 00:38:15,520
Scott: Like Batman.

646
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,160
Scott: It's like, if people knew Bruce Wayne was Batman, it's like Bruce Wayne's a rich dude.

647
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,297
Scott: It's not actually sort of a big problem for him.

648
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:29,660
Rym: Or he doesn't need an alter ego because based on many portrayals of Batman, he's just, he could just be like, Oh yeah, that's where the crazy old billionaire lives.

649
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,439
Rym: And just like be invisible to society and just be Batman full time.

650
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:33,317
Scott: Right.

651
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,720
Scott: But Spider-Man has like, you know, depending on what time it is, right.

652
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:39,380
Scott: He's got, he has a family, he's a normal person.

653
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,880
Scott: He has a wife, right.

654
00:38:41,962 --> 00:38:42,597
Scott: At some points.

655
00:38:43,026 --> 00:38:43,300
Scott: Right.

656
00:38:43,762 --> 00:38:47,200
Scott: It's like, he's protecting those people, not him himself.

657
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:52,220
Scott: In the same way that like doxing of internet celebrities is a thing these days.

658
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:52,620
Scott: Right.

659
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:58,257
Scott: It's like, you know, he wasn't so much protecting himself as he was protecting these other people around him.

660
00:38:58,830 --> 00:38:59,080
Scott: Right.

661
00:39:00,204 --> 00:39:01,636
Scott: You know, cause he had fame, right.

662
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,758
Scott: He didn't necessarily want to be famous.

663
00:39:05,482 --> 00:39:08,460
Scott: You know, he just wanted to, you know, to, to do well, right.

664
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,219
Scott: With his powers.

665
00:39:10,061 --> 00:39:17,319
Rym: And he's often very zoomed in like the wisecrack in like with one random kid on the street as a little aside before like the other story starts.

666
00:39:19,302 --> 00:39:21,480
Scott: Spider-Man always, you know, the other superheroes, right.

667
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:25,759
Scott: They do, you know, the smallest thing Superman does is catch someone falling off a building.

668
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:26,340
Scott: Right.

669
00:39:27,261 --> 00:39:30,499
Scott: Superman doesn't go and like play basketball with the kids.

670
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:31,220
Scott: Right.

671
00:39:32,221 --> 00:39:39,659
Scott: But Spider-Man does that not only in comics, but like in real life, people put on a Spider-Man costume and play basketball with the kids.

672
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:55,500
Scott: And it's like, even though, right, like someone else putting on some other superhero costume, even a Spider-Man one doing shit, like shaking down tourists for money and photos or, you know, birthday parties and stuff.

673
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:55,920
Scott: Right.

674
00:39:56,161 --> 00:40:05,280
Scott: But it's like, if you do that in a Spider-Man costume, as opposed to like an Iron Man costume, it feels kind of real actually, even as an adult.

675
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:09,200
Scott: It's like, yeah, that's your friend in a Spider-Man costume at the kid's birthday party.

676
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,100
Scott: But it's like Spider-Man, the real Spider-Man would totally do that.

677
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:19,800
Rym: So I'm pretty sure Spider-Man has like literally shown up at a kid's birthday more than once in it, in like all the different runs of Spider-Man.

678
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,980
Scott: I think I was in like, uh, I think I had like a high school.

679
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:30,699
Scott: I knew it was when I was in high school, it was my brother's friends in high school who did that, like as a job, just like being Spider-Man at kid's birthday parties.

680
00:40:31,201 --> 00:40:32,178
Scott: And it's like, it's a good deal.

681
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:41,019
Scott: But also like you could take, if you're a kid in this fight, it's like, if you're a kid in Batman shows up, it's like, you sort of know it's not Batman.

682
00:40:41,307 --> 00:40:41,560
Scott: Yeah.

683
00:40:41,761 --> 00:40:41,887
Scott: Right.

684
00:40:42,682 --> 00:40:42,999
Scott: Anyway.

685
00:40:45,841 --> 00:40:49,820
Rym: But, uh, the one thing I have not read is many Spider-Man comics.

686
00:40:50,921 --> 00:40:51,745
Scott: I've read, I've

687
00:40:51,765 --> 00:41:01,670
Rym: seen many of the movies, uh, with, but I never particularly liked that many of them until Spider-Verse, which was just such a triumph that

688
00:41:02,032 --> 00:41:03,778
Scott: the live action movies may, some

689
00:41:03,818 --> 00:41:05,488
Rym: of them were, some of them were better than others, but

690
00:41:05,508 --> 00:41:07,320
Scott: I've only seen one and may.

691
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,472
Rym: I've seen several first one, the first Toby McGuire one I liked pretty well.

692
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:12,680
Scott: Is that's, that's the, probably the one I saw, right?

693
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,700
Scott: The upside down kiss one.

694
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:14,040
Rym: Yeah.

695
00:41:14,683 --> 00:41:15,200
Scott: Yeah, whatever.

696
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:21,580
Rym: Cause in that era, like superhero movies were particularly bad and that one, the Spider-Man one was actually, they're also particular.

697
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,739
Scott: That was like when they started becoming a thing.

698
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:24,309
Scott: Right.

699
00:41:25,402 --> 00:41:26,378
Scott: Now there's too much of a thing.

700
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:26,825
Scott: Yeah.

701
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:29,956
Scott: So, I mean, of the Spider-Man comics that I have read, right.

702
00:41:31,081 --> 00:41:33,720
Scott: It's like, you know, there are sort of different kinds of them.

703
00:41:33,781 --> 00:41:35,340
Scott: They go into different categories, right?

704
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:44,139
Scott: It's like a lot of the old ones, the super old ones, like the actual Stanley, Steve Ditko ones, some of them are obviously super corny and old.

705
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:58,060
Scott: But along with their corny and oldness, they also have some really impactful stories, really similar to what you get with Fantastic Four, which is also, you know, I guess that's a Stan Lee and Kirby joint, but I guess it's a Stan Lee thing, right.

706
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:06,320
Scott: Where it's like, you're sort of mixing the corniness with also, you know, they're very sort of powerful human tales, right.

707
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,360
Scott: And if you just, you can figure out which issues, right.

708
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:16,020
Scott: Like there's the famous one where he's trapped under all the, the, the machine that like collapsed in on him and there's like, it takes him several pages.

709
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:19,000
Scott: It's like lift the machine off of himself while he talks to himself.

710
00:42:19,569 --> 00:42:19,799
Scott: Right.

711
00:42:20,161 --> 00:42:24,920
Scott: And it's like, that's the same comics exactly where you get really corny stuff.

712
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:30,540
Scott: Like why is cracking it really corny as villains that no one remembers.

713
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:45,080
Rym: But one thing I liked is that the Spider-Man's wisecracking, even in the early comics was always just better written and fit better in the universe than most of the other superheroes that were trying to wisecrack or talk to themselves or talk to the, like talk to the reader.

714
00:42:46,381 --> 00:42:53,680
Scott: Well, I think, uh, Dan Slott, who actually is an ex who's wrote Spider-Man for MIT for a long, long time, actually more recently.

715
00:42:54,580 --> 00:43:00,880
Scott: Um, and Dan Slott, if you don't know, I, the first time I ever read a Dan Slott comic, it was a Ren and Stimpy Marvel comic.

716
00:43:02,051 --> 00:43:02,219
Scott: Yeah.

717
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:05,600
Scott: Dan Slott is like a great, uh, great superhero writer.

718
00:43:06,162 --> 00:43:16,220
Scott: Uh, he had a Twitter thread recently where he talked about how like, Hey, you know, these are the reasons, you know, if you're writing Spider-Man, you know, wisecracking at people, right.

719
00:43:16,822 --> 00:43:19,280
Scott: Uh, these are like the do's and don'ts, right.

720
00:43:19,481 --> 00:43:24,580
Scott: It's like, you know, Spider-Man sometimes so wisecrack at people to calm his own nerves, right.

721
00:43:24,882 --> 00:43:27,020
Scott: Or his sense of humor is like this, right.

722
00:43:27,281 --> 00:43:31,540
Scott: And people who've written Spider-Man haven't always followed those rules, right.

723
00:43:31,661 --> 00:43:32,358
Scott: When writing him.

724
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:39,219
Scott: So it's like, you might pick up a Spider-Man comic and actually find an asshole Spider-Man in there because there's been so many different people writing it over the years.

725
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,460
Scott: But, you know, you view the good Spider-Man, right.

726
00:43:44,601 --> 00:43:47,340
Scott: Is written the way Dan said in that Twitter thread.

727
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:54,152
Rym: Um, well also the spice Spider-Man seems to have a better continuity of character than a lot of other popular, like.

728
00:43:54,172 --> 00:44:06,699
Rym: Batman is a similarly well-known popular character, but Batman is on this like widely swinging scale of from Adam West on one side to like, I'm Batman on the other side.

729
00:44:08,142 --> 00:44:08,560
Scott: Oh, you're right.

730
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:09,580
Rym: Batman is so different.

731
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:10,560
Scott: I found that.

732
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,540
Scott: I found the thread and it won't take that long to read.

733
00:44:12,841 --> 00:44:14,159
Scott: So it's like, it bugs me.

734
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:17,179
Scott: So Dan slot says, uh, spider rant.

735
00:44:17,981 --> 00:44:24,240
Scott: It bugs me when spider fans say that Spidey only uses his jokes and quips to disorient his foes.

736
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:27,560
Scott: That is one way Spidey uses his sense of humor.

737
00:44:28,061 --> 00:44:30,979
Scott: Spider-Man sense of humor is also one of his most versatile tools.

738
00:44:31,422 --> 00:44:33,015
Scott: It's practically his superpower, right?

739
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:38,160
Scott: He also uses it to distract civilians when they're in stressful situations.

740
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:42,360
Scott: Like you're a Spider-Man picks someone up off the ground, swinging on a thing.

741
00:44:42,742 --> 00:44:44,179
Scott: He always says something funny to him.

742
00:44:44,612 --> 00:44:44,800
Scott: Right.

743
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,120
Scott: Every time, right.

744
00:44:46,541 --> 00:44:48,399
Scott: To amuse himself and put himself at ease.

745
00:44:49,361 --> 00:44:51,840
Scott: He's always talking to himself, even if there's no one else around.

746
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:52,151
Scott: Right.

747
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:56,640
Scott: He's just like, uh, you know, angsting on a, I mean, look, they even lampoon that in spider verse.

748
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:00,419
Rym: We're like, as he becomes Spider-Man spoilers, the kid becomes Spider-Man.

749
00:45:01,141 --> 00:45:05,560
Rym: He, uh, he starts like having this inner monologue that was loud and wasn't there before.

750
00:45:05,682 --> 00:45:07,160
Rym: Like he starts to wise crack.

751
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:11,360
Rym: Like that's almost part of his superpowers to make himself appear foolish.

752
00:45:11,461 --> 00:45:13,780
Scott: So people underestimate him, which is very true.

753
00:45:13,865 --> 00:45:14,060
Scott: Right.

754
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:19,766
Scott: Spider-Man it's like, he sort of like people forget the spider part, like insect, like you.

755
00:45:19,787 --> 00:45:21,880
Scott: don't actually think of spiders too much.

756
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:27,221
Scott: When you think of Spider-Man, I think a wise cracking guy swinging through a city, He's.

757
00:45:27,342 --> 00:45:37,760
Scott: the only thing really spider like about him, except for the fact that web spiders also make webs and he climbs on walls is that he's a pest, but insects are pests and the spiders aren't insects.

758
00:45:38,049 --> 00:45:38,278
Scott: Right.

759
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:45,120
Scott: Um, but regardless, uh, you know, he's, he's like ridiculously strong, right?

760
00:45:45,522 --> 00:45:48,920
Scott: Um, not Superman strong, but still ridiculously strong.

761
00:45:49,441 --> 00:45:56,580
Scott: But yet, if you look at him next to the other heroes, even in just the Marvel universe, it's like he looks weak compared to them.

762
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:02,432
Scott: It's like Thor is there, the literal God and his Spider-Man, a guy who swings on a rope.

763
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:08,740
Rym: But it's pretty canonically consistent that Spider-Man is strong and powerful enough to hold his own in those environment.

764
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,379
Scott: Pick cars and up and throw them at people.

765
00:46:10,621 --> 00:46:12,599
Scott: It's like he's not messing around.

766
00:46:13,242 --> 00:46:22,020
Scott: Um, but also he, it, the final thing on the list is, uh, he uses jokes to strike back at jerks like Jonah, right?

767
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:31,980
Scott: His boss who he can't punch, but he can, uh, you know, harass them with a verbally and of course to goof around and bond with the other superheroes.

768
00:46:32,172 --> 00:46:32,300
Scott: Right.

769
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:38,597
Scott: So pretty much anytime Superman, Spider-Man talks to another superhero, it's always making fun of them.

770
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:39,198
Scott: Right.

771
00:46:39,561 --> 00:46:44,740
Scott: It's like, no matter what, he has a nickname for every other superhero, right?

772
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:46,300
Scott: He's just sort of making fun.

773
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:53,920
Scott: It's like he is a superhero, but all the other superheroes are sort of taking themselves seriously at being superheroes.

774
00:46:55,120 --> 00:47:00,820
Scott: Whereas Spider-Man, despite being almost the first of those superheroes, right.

775
00:47:01,341 --> 00:47:04,500
Scott: Is sort of meta, right?

776
00:47:05,341 --> 00:47:07,639
Scott: Uh, and sort of outside of the rest of them.

777
00:47:07,921 --> 00:47:10,296
Scott: He's like, oh, it's here before the re all of most of you, right?

778
00:47:11,401 --> 00:47:13,039
Scott: Whether that's, you know, true or not.

779
00:47:13,382 --> 00:47:14,219
Rym: I'm just doing my thing.

780
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:15,138
Rym: Don't mess up New York.

781
00:47:17,423 --> 00:47:26,697
Scott: But, you know, he's just messing with the rest of them and sort of, you know, giving you, again, you're identifying with him, not only in that he's like you, right.

782
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:41,120
Scott: In some way, but also in that he's outside, not quite breaking entirely breaking in the fourth wall, but still outside of the rest of the universe that he is occupying from the reader's perspective.

783
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:52,780
Rym: Which is good because a lot of Spider-Man media is very like just Spider-Man, even if it's an alternate Spider-Man or a weird Spider-Man or Spider-Man's dead, but then he isn't or that's actually Venom or whatever.

784
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:54,867
Rym: It's still like Spider-Man.

785
00:47:54,887 --> 00:48:00,280
Rym: stories are more often self-contained with not as much crazy crossover nonsense with the rest of the universe.

786
00:48:01,041 --> 00:48:02,319
Rym: Not that that doesn't happen, though.

787
00:48:02,997 --> 00:48:03,120
Scott: Yeah.

788
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:06,060
Scott: You know, it depends which one you read or whatever.

789
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,499
Scott: It happens all the time.

790
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:14,476
Rym: It's tough because whatever Spider-Man I liked, like Spider-Verse was basically like the height of Spider-Man for me.

791
00:48:15,802 --> 00:48:17,680
Scott: Well, I mean, how much Spider-Man have you read?

792
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:18,480
Scott: There's plenty of Spider-Men.

793
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,120
Rym: I haven't read a lot.

794
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:20,199
Rym: I've seen a lot.

795
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,939
Scott: I mean, if you read Miles Morales Spider-Man, that's what that is.

796
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:24,256
Scott: Yeah.

797
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:26,140
Rym: Probably should just read that actually at some point.

798
00:48:26,541 --> 00:48:32,140
Scott: You know, it's like, if you find yourself saying, man, you know, I watched all these I don't read a lot of comics, right?

799
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:38,640
Scott: I watched a bunch of Spider-Man movies or superhero movies, and I really liked this Spider-Verse one, right?

800
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:41,480
Scott: You look at me, I'm someone who's like, Hey, I read a lot of comics.

801
00:48:41,943 --> 00:48:44,100
Scott: I don't like a lot of superhero movies.

802
00:48:44,407 --> 00:48:44,700
Scott: Right.

803
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:48,740
Scott: Um, but I liked that one because it was like the comics.

804
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:49,399
Scott: Well, guess what?

805
00:48:50,022 --> 00:48:54,379
Scott: If you like that movie, you're going to like the comics because they're like that movie, right?

806
00:48:54,742 --> 00:48:57,779
Scott: It's more like comics than any superhero movie ever was.

807
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:05,060
Rym: Oh, I mean, look at how many people watch these like Marvel Cinematic Universe movies that aren't Spider-Man, but then they get excited like, Oh, I'll go read the comics.

808
00:49:05,202 --> 00:49:06,599
Rym: And they, that usually doesn't go well.

809
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:08,980
Scott: The comic is not like those, right?

810
00:49:09,041 --> 00:49:11,060
Scott: Which is a lot of reasons why I don't like those.

811
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:12,238
Scott: They're not like comics.

812
00:49:12,701 --> 00:49:18,280
Scott: They're just the same characters, uh, you know, superficially or, you know, more than superficially sometimes.

813
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:27,159
Rym: The one thing I can say though, the only thing I've never like, even the Spider-Man comics I've read, I've never been super jazzed about the villains in the spot that Spider-Man is facing.

814
00:49:27,281 --> 00:49:28,880
Rym: I'm usually really focused on Spider-Man.

815
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:33,651
Rym: Whereas with any other superhero stuff, I find myself often more interested in the villains.

816
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:35,575
Rym: Like I like Batman villains a lot.

817
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:40,020
Scott: Well, I think that's, that's exactly what I think most people would agree with, right?

818
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:44,180
Scott: Even it, even in Star Wars, it's like, yeah, the empire are bad guys.

819
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:51,955
Scott: I'm not rooting for them, but listen, there's no denying that at least aesthetically Darth Vader and the emperor are cooler than whiny.

820
00:49:51,995 --> 00:49:53,280
Scott: Luke Skywalker, right?

821
00:49:53,961 --> 00:49:55,758
Scott: There's Han Solo is cool, right?

822
00:49:56,287 --> 00:49:56,880
Scott: Luke Skywalker.

823
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:58,139
Scott: How cool is he really?

824
00:49:58,580 --> 00:49:59,238
Scott: Not, not cool.

825
00:49:59,803 --> 00:50:01,500
Scott: Princess Leia is cool, right?

826
00:50:02,061 --> 00:50:04,320
Scott: C-3PO is maybe cool.

827
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:06,475
Scott: R2D2 is cool, right?

828
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:13,580
Scott: It's like, you know, but like, you know, TIE fighters, they're cooler than, you know, X-wings mostly kinda, right?

829
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:15,400
Scott: Yeah.

830
00:50:15,646 --> 00:50:16,059
Scott: Same thing.

831
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:18,960
Scott: So Batman, it's like, yeah, it's like Batman.

832
00:50:19,082 --> 00:50:19,860
Scott: He's okay.

833
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:20,460
Scott: Right.

834
00:50:20,621 --> 00:50:23,560
Scott: But it's like, the Joker is cooler than Batman, right?

835
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:34,440
Rym: That was actually a long set up joke in the venture brothers where there's this assassin guy and the kid bonds with him because they both love superhero comics and Batman is their favorite comic.

836
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:35,380
Rym: It's like this long thing.

837
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:38,180
Rym: And the very end, it turns out the guy's the evil assassin.

838
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:40,460
Rym: The kid's like, but you love Batman.

839
00:50:40,643 --> 00:50:41,520
Rym: How could you be this way?

840
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:44,660
Rym: And he's like, kid, I only like Batman for the villains.

841
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:46,316
Scott: Yeah, that's right.

842
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:48,453
Scott: The villains are cooler than, yup.

843
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:56,220
Rym: Well, I'm just poking at this fighter man Wikipedia and I'm scrolling through the list of villains because the list of like every major villain Spider-Man's ever fought.

844
00:50:57,182 --> 00:50:59,459
Rym: Eh, like this is not the A-list of villains here.

845
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:04,220
Scott: No, I mean, you got guys like, you know, cause most of it is like corny stuff, right?

846
00:51:04,361 --> 00:51:05,639
Scott: It's like guy who dresses up in a rhino.

847
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:08,899
Rym: I was, that was exactly why Rhino was the first one I was gonna...

848
00:51:09,422 --> 00:51:15,200
Scott: You got the lizard guy, you got, uh, you know, a lot of times he'll be, he'll be like messing with other heroes.

849
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,718
Scott: He'll get tangled up with them, right?

850
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:19,316
Scott: Sometimes, um, you got Dr.

851
00:51:19,881 --> 00:51:20,600
Scott: Octopus, right?

852
00:51:20,641 --> 00:51:21,200
Scott: Who's okay.

853
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:25,900
Scott: I guess you got Green Goblins, Hobgoblin, all kinds of goblins involved, right?

854
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:27,034
Rym: The Jackal.

855
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:28,580
Scott: Oh yeah.

856
00:51:28,721 --> 00:51:29,058
Scott: The Jackal.

857
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:29,939
Rym: I remember the Jackal.

858
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,279
Rym: I think the Jackal was very cartoon.

859
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,659
Scott: The Jackal was very lizard related.

860
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,759
Scott: He got Mysterio who's kind of cool a little bit, maybe.

861
00:51:37,001 --> 00:51:38,778
Rym: I like Mysterio, Kingpin.

862
00:51:39,902 --> 00:51:40,607
Rym: Uh, Venom was interesting.

863
00:51:42,804 --> 00:51:43,700
Scott: Venom sort of, yeah.

864
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:45,540
Scott: Venom is like a whole thing unto itself.

865
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:48,680
Scott: That's again, that's sort of like the cool villain syndrome, right?

866
00:51:49,183 --> 00:51:51,940
Scott: Where it's like, it was Spider-Man, but then it was someone else.

867
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:52,618
Scott: It was too cool.

868
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:53,439
Rym: So it had to be its own.

869
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,180
Scott: And then it was, and then it was Carnage.

870
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:58,759
Rym: Um, but like Electro missed me with that.

871
00:51:59,405 --> 00:51:59,580
Scott: Yeah.

872
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:10,039
Scott: It's like most Spider-Man villains are just like wacky dude, at least in, you know, it's like, yeah, there are stories where they're written well and they don't come across as wacky dude.

873
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:10,680
Scott: Right.

874
00:52:11,001 --> 00:52:15,360
Scott: But it's like the classic Spider-Man comics, those villains are just, all right.

875
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:16,600
Scott: It's a, it's a different.

876
00:52:17,141 --> 00:52:17,352
Scott: Right.

877
00:52:18,189 --> 00:52:18,360
Scott: Right.

878
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:22,119
Rym: But I think that's cause the story is tended to focus more on Peter or whoever.

879
00:52:22,219 --> 00:52:26,360
Rym: is Spider-Man navigating their real life and spider life simultaneously.

880
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:27,804
Rym: And that's usually.

881
00:52:27,844 --> 00:52:36,140
Scott: that's the drama was, you know, aunt May something, something dealing with my wife, dealing with, you know, Jonah dealing with whatever.

882
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:36,799
Scott: Right.

883
00:52:37,041 --> 00:52:42,720
Scott: And the villain was just sort of there to be like, Hey, this guy, Spider-Man is dealing with all this shit in his life.

884
00:52:42,781 --> 00:52:44,099
Scott: And that's the parts you care about.

885
00:52:44,482 --> 00:52:50,008
Scott: And while he's dealing with all that, he's got to find some nut dressed up like a rhino, really on top of everything else.

886
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:55,120
Rym: But that on top of everything else is just it.

887
00:52:55,220 --> 00:53:00,439
Rym: If I had to really crystallize this idea, it's that with a lot of superhero things, the identity is just boring.

888
00:53:00,902 --> 00:53:03,699
Rym: And as soon as there's a villain and a fight, like, yeah, that's all I'm here for.

889
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:10,560
Rym: Like, yes, finally, he's not just like in his house, but with Spider-Man, when the villain shows up, I'm like, ah, but I want to follow that.

890
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:11,479
Rym: I want to follow this story.

891
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:12,417
Rym: I want to see what happens.

892
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:12,906
Rym: Right.

893
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:14,100
Rym: Now I've got to go watch this fight.

894
00:53:14,904 --> 00:53:15,618
Rym: What's Peter going to do?

895
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:20,040
Scott: And that's, and that's another way in that it is much like, you know, real life.

896
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:27,819
Scott: I think anyone is, you're going to find us Spider-Man in, you know, uh, you know, interpretation somewhere that is for you.

897
00:53:28,266 --> 00:53:28,540
Scott: Right.

898
00:53:28,821 --> 00:53:34,099
Scott: And I think in this way, it's for everyone and that it's like, yeah, you've got the shit you're dealing with in your real life.

899
00:53:34,562 --> 00:53:37,460
Scott: And suddenly as it's fucking plague, all right.

900
00:53:38,081 --> 00:53:46,099
Scott: That's just, it's just everyone's guy in a rhino costume, just coming up, right on top of everything else.

901
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:48,938
Scott: You know, you got a pandemic to deal with.

902
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:49,475
Scott: Yeah.

903
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:55,578
Scott: Also, Spider-Man feels the same way Spider-Man feels when someone robs a bank and he's got to do something about it.

904
00:53:55,981 --> 00:54:02,240
Rym: We got to mention at least briefly that original, terrible Spider-Man theme is brilliant.

905
00:54:03,405 --> 00:54:04,280
Scott: Oh, the original song.

906
00:54:04,501 --> 00:54:05,819
Rym: Do you do Spider-Man?

907
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:12,220
Scott: That's from the original, the original Spider-Man cartoon way back when or whatever, like the continuity of that jingle.

908
00:54:13,432 --> 00:54:13,600
Scott: Yeah.

909
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:15,480
Scott: I mean, that song, I don't know who wrote that song.

910
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:18,560
Scott: You can probably, I'm sure I don't, you know, what do I know about the history of that song?

911
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:18,840
Scott: Nothing.

912
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:19,418
Scott: Go look it up.

913
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:20,140
Scott: You'll right.

914
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:26,355
Scott: I am looking it up to see if I can provide some commentary, but what I do know is that that's Jay Robert Harris wrote it.

915
00:54:26,951 --> 00:54:27,080
Scott: Right.

916
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,673
Scott: My famous, my favorite Wikipedia article.

917
00:54:29,694 --> 00:54:30,840
Scott: that I'm sure it does.

918
00:54:30,964 --> 00:54:31,091
Scott: Yeah.

919
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:37,879
Scott: My favorite thing about that song is when there was a TV commercial for Bomberman 64 that reuse that song.

920
00:54:38,283 --> 00:54:40,140
Scott: And instead of doing Spider-Man, it was Bomberman.

921
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:42,460
Scott: It was Bomberman, Bomberman, right?

922
00:54:43,202 --> 00:54:44,280
Scott: Drops bombs across the list.

923
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:44,540
Rym: All right.

924
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,019
Rym: So the story is kind of interesting.

925
00:54:46,462 --> 00:54:50,640
Rym: So it was composed by this, uh, Paul Francis Webster and Robert Bob Harris.

926
00:54:51,122 --> 00:55:02,159
Rym: It was recorded by RCA in Toronto, and they got together a whole bunch of CBC vocalist groups, like the Billy Van singers and all these other like groups that were famous in the day.

927
00:55:02,942 --> 00:55:05,900
Rym: And then they add backing tracks added later from New York.

928
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:10,700
Scott: It was kind of cobbled together, just like any other low rent TV production.

929
00:55:10,964 --> 00:55:12,100
Rym: It was the lowest rent.

930
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:13,540
Rym: Like we need a fucking jingle.

931
00:55:13,762 --> 00:55:14,298
Rym: Just make it.

932
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:15,195
Rym: No one gives a shit.

933
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:18,780
Rym: The, the, all the people who sang were paid for the gig.

934
00:55:19,041 --> 00:55:24,219
Rym: There were no residuals, like no one even thought that anyone would care about this song ever again.

935
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:25,020
Scott: Yeah.

936
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:29,460
Scott: I mean, if you go back to the, you know, sixties or whatever, there were plenty of similar jingles, right?

937
00:55:29,641 --> 00:55:31,520
Scott: I mean, people in New York, right?

938
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:32,859
Scott: Noted noted Mets fan.

939
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:36,580
Scott: Spider-Man would know the song, meet the Mets, right?

940
00:55:36,882 --> 00:55:39,420
Scott: Which is a jingle with a similar sort of history.

941
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:42,660
Scott: There was like a contest to make a song to, you know, for the Mets.

942
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:43,397
Scott: Right.

943
00:55:43,861 --> 00:56:00,959
Scott: And it's a similar kind of, you know, sixties, you know, commercial jingle thing and there's tons of them, but only the ones that are associated with properties that survived like Spider-Man and the Mets are remembered and stuck in people's heads to this day.

944
00:56:01,249 --> 00:56:01,500
Scott: Right.

945
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,400
Rym: So you're all thinking this song in your head right now.

946
00:56:04,482 --> 00:56:05,078
Rym: You can't avoid it.

947
00:56:05,621 --> 00:56:19,619
Scott: I'm sure there are plenty of other commercial jingles from the, the times that are similarly catchy and we're just associated with things that no longer exist and the jingles didn't get enough play to stick in the collective societal memory.

948
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:21,892
Rym: So I feel like I'm thinking about this cause.

949
00:56:21,953 --> 00:56:25,860
Rym: actually the listener mentioned that they also loved Spider-Man 2099.

950
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:29,704
Rym: I feel like I should read Spider-Man 2099 because I don't know anything about it.

951
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:33,122
Scott: I have every, I have every issue of Spider-Man 2099.

952
00:56:33,122 --> 00:56:34,079
Scott: You should absolutely read it.

953
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:37,459
Scott: And then we could do like a whole series of episodes on it for that.

954
00:56:38,282 --> 00:56:42,888
Scott: Spider-Man 2099 is basically is a, it's the year 2099.

955
00:56:42,888 --> 00:56:43,100
Scott: Yeah.

956
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:49,780
Scott: The cyberpunk Spider-Man, the Marvel, the Marvel universe is now a cyberpunk universe where evil corporations run everything.

957
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:50,004
Scott: And, uh, Dr.

958
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:52,320
Scott: Doom eventually becomes president.

959
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:53,499
Rym: Wait, this might be a little too real.

960
00:56:53,621 --> 00:56:55,100
Rym: Maybe I don't want to read this in 2020.

961
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:55,697
Scott: It's very real.

962
00:56:56,402 --> 00:57:04,099
Scott: Uh, and Spider-Man is this, uh, dude called Miguel O'Hara and he is a genetics researcher for the big evil corporation.

963
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:06,419
Rym: And doesn't he accidentally Spider-Manify himself?

964
00:57:07,093 --> 00:57:07,137
Scott: No.

965
00:57:07,261 --> 00:57:08,960
Scott: He's a huge ass jerk, right?

966
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:10,299
Scott: Is he's not a nice person.

967
00:57:10,862 --> 00:57:16,520
Scott: And he basically somewhat intentionally, uh, Spider-Man's himself, right?

968
00:57:17,223 --> 00:57:18,940
Scott: Uh, he has a holographic, right?

969
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,815
Scott: Assistant just sort of like Blade Runner situation, right?

970
00:57:23,301 --> 00:57:30,380
Scott: Um, you know, and he Spider-Man's himself and then shit happens and his brother is the good person.

971
00:57:30,461 --> 00:57:31,238
Scott: He's the bad person.

972
00:57:31,466 --> 00:57:31,635
Scott: Yeah.

973
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:35,959
Scott: Um, even though he does end up fighting people who are worse than him.

974
00:57:37,025 --> 00:57:39,320
Scott: Uh, it's mostly a cyberpunk story, right?

975
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:48,680
Scott: And not really, uh, you know, and also a Spider-Man story, but he's not like a, um, he's not like doing a good job of anything, right?

976
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:49,819
Scott: He's like the drug addict.

977
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:54,100
Rym: Begrudgingly like, ah, I got a Spider-Man something.

978
00:57:54,782 --> 00:57:57,099
Scott: Uh, yeah, pretty much I'm game for this.

979
00:57:57,981 --> 00:58:01,735
Scott: Um, but yeah, they have Spider-Man.

980
00:58:01,956 --> 00:58:03,100
Rym: we've gone on long enough.

981
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:04,798
Rym: We could stop the show there unless we have more to say.

982
00:58:05,701 --> 00:58:08,140
Scott: I mean, as you could talk about Spider-Man's, there's so much material.

983
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:15,220
Rym: You can just talk forever, but like you could probably make an entire podcast that just talked about Spider-Man in film.

984
00:58:15,994 --> 00:58:16,120
Scott: Yeah.

985
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:17,719
Scott: I'm sure there probably is such a podcast.

986
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:18,399
Rym: There is.

987
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:18,998
Rym: You'll listen to that.

988
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:20,819
Scott: How many Spider-Man things there are.

989
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:23,480
Rym: It's bring me, bring me podcasts of Spider-Man.

990
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:26,700
Scott: I think, I think there's just a property of media in general, right?

991
00:58:26,781 --> 00:58:29,720
Scott: Is that when something gets big enough, right?

992
00:58:30,321 --> 00:58:35,760
Scott: When something gets big enough and popular enough, then suddenly the meta of it becomes worthy of discussion.

993
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:39,798
Rym: It's like some sea creatures that get like their own ecosystem that just like surrounds them.

994
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:43,880
Scott: So like, did you know there's like a James Bond magazine?

995
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:53,980
Scott: I don't know how often it's comes out, but like the exact kind of person who subscribes to James Bond magazine, I don't know if it's monthly or quarterly or whatever, but like there's an official James Bond magazine.

996
00:58:54,141 --> 00:58:56,319
Scott: It's like, that just keeps coming out all the time.

997
00:58:56,870 --> 00:58:57,058
Scott: Right.

998
00:58:58,021 --> 00:59:00,735
Scott: Um, you know, it's like Spider-Man is big enough.

999
00:59:00,776 --> 00:59:07,480
Scott: that like, you know, this amazing Spider-Man, spectacular Spider-Man, so many Spider-Man is different Spider-Man comics all the time.

1000
00:59:08,161 --> 00:59:14,210
Scott: It's like, once you're big enough, you just create this fountain where just like you, you can't stop your own growth.

1001
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:19,815
Scott: media wise, because even if you don't make things that are official Canon material,

1002
00:59:19,855 --> 00:59:22,484
Rym: fans, making stuff, you got fans,

1003
00:59:22,965 --> 00:59:24,149
Scott: meta stuff,

1004
00:59:24,189 --> 00:59:26,656
Rym: people talking about your stuff, you've got

1005
00:59:26,676 --> 00:59:26,736
Scott: for

1006
00:59:28,201 --> 00:59:28,825
Rym: a number

1007
00:59:28,845 --> 00:59:29,710
Scott: ending people

1008
00:59:29,730 --> 00:59:33,130
Rym: who just straight up steal it and make their own version of Spider-Man, which is, and

1009
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:43,422
Scott: then you get, and every part of me, if you have media, you get the video games, you get the toys, you get like, you know, re you know, people just making things that have nothing to do with it.

1010
00:59:43,462 --> 00:59:48,019
Scott: Like someone will buy a bicycle, but they'll make it a Spider-Man bicycle.

1011
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:50,059
Scott: They'll paint it red and blue and put webbing on it.

1012
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:50,799
Rym: You know what I will say though?

1013
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:56,800
Rym: You talk about a piece of Spider-Man media, that Atari 2,600 Spider-Man game, people make fun of it for being like an old bad Atari game.

1014
00:59:56,820 --> 00:59:59,355
Rym: But honestly, it's one of the best Atari 2,600 games.

1015
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:06,698
Rym: It's a legit, a lot of, there's not a lot of competition there, but I'm saying it is like, it's a pretty good game.

1016
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:10,620
Scott: Spider-Man makes much better video games than a lot of other superheroes.

1017
01:00:12,465 --> 01:00:13,600
Rym: I hesitate to speculate.

1018
01:00:13,788 --> 01:00:13,872
Rym: Why?

1019
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:20,052
Scott: Cause I don't know, but I think it's just because the verbs of Spider-Man right is you can make.

1020
01:00:20,072 --> 01:00:20,860
Scott: the powers are simple.

1021
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:28,020
Scott: Like there's a small set of, you walk down to a Batman game, you walk down the street, beaten up guys, and then you throw a battering, right?

1022
01:00:28,401 --> 01:00:38,540
Scott: Whereas a Spider-Man game, you have the verb of swinging on webs, which is what makes it, you know, or like I said, taking photos of bad guys, you have these extra verbs, right?

1023
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:46,240
Rym: Um, whereas most other could have like the interrogation verb, which is most people who make games don't make, no one's made a Batman game like that.

1024
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:46,380
Rym: Yeah.

1025
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:46,860
Rym: That's the problem.

1026
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:50,457
Rym: For whatever reason, Batman games tend to be just side scrolling or right.

1027
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:59,060
Scott: Most video games tend to be action games and no matter what superhero you have, it doesn't really make the game any different, right?

1028
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:02,520
Scott: Captain America, he throws a shield, Hawkeye shoots a bow and arrow.

1029
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:05,579
Rym: And then you do a palette swap and you could sell the same game for superheroes.

1030
01:01:06,501 --> 01:01:10,050
Scott: It's like you walk down the street, punch and stuff, or you fly around, punch and stuff.

1031
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:11,380
Rym: Palette swap that Genesis game.

1032
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:13,960
Rym: Someone's like, why is captain America taking pictures of the red?

1033
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:15,577
Scott: So like there's that new ish.

1034
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:18,020
Scott: So, you know, PlayStation, Spider-Man game.

1035
01:01:18,081 --> 01:01:19,599
Scott: That's supposed to be ridiculously good.

1036
01:01:19,845 --> 01:01:20,036
Scott: Yeah.

1037
01:01:20,363 --> 01:01:20,556
Scott: Right.

1038
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:28,253
Rym: In fact, you know what, you know what I found in VR chat the other day, a Spider-Man world, and when I went into it to see what the deal was, you know what it is?

1039
01:01:28,741 --> 01:01:35,136
Rym: It's an infinite, endless New York city skyline and you can just web swing through it in VR.

1040
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:35,777
Rym: That's it.

1041
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:36,839
Rym: That's the whole fucking world.

1042
01:01:37,324 --> 01:01:37,737
Scott: There you go.

1043
01:01:38,385 --> 01:01:38,679
Scott: It's great.

1044
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:41,178
Rym: It actually was real fun.

1045
01:01:41,801 --> 01:01:46,296
Rym: I, I had to go find like some bootleg Spider-Man avatar and I went in there and you know what it was?

1046
01:01:46,296 --> 01:01:48,819
Rym: 20 other people, everyone dressed as Spider-Man.

1047
01:01:49,260 --> 01:02:02,000
Rym: One person legit had a JJJ avatar instead and he was swinging around yelling at people for photos and it was all these like bootleg Spider-Man flying around in this virtual world, but no one's doing that in a Batman world.

1048
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:02,345
Rym: Nope.

1049
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:04,820
Rym: I don't know if I didn't even see anyone doing that.

1050
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:05,565
Scott: The cats in America.

1051
01:02:05,585 --> 01:02:07,119
Scott: cats in America will be boring as hell.

1052
01:02:07,261 --> 01:02:07,347
Scott: Yeah.

1053
01:02:08,181 --> 01:02:11,255
Scott: Not that I don't like cats in America for other reasons, but still that would be boring.

1054
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:32,120
Rym: So yeah, uh, if you somehow, if not, like I'm sure all of you, a hundred percent of the listener is aware of the existence of Spider-Man, but if you've never consumed any Spider-Man media, honestly, I would recommend consuming some Spider-Man media directly instead of just absorbing it through osmosis.

1055
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:35,420
Rym: Cause it's Spider-Man on the level pretty good overall.

1056
01:02:36,236 --> 01:02:36,320
Scott: Yeah.

1057
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:39,260
Scott: I would recommend if you don't know, this is like basically an infant.

1058
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:44,538
Scott: You could read Spider-Man comics for the rest of your life unless you narrow yourself down like that silver age Spider-Man guy.

1059
01:02:46,742 --> 01:02:55,860
Scott: So what I would recommend doing right is read some of the original, original Spider-Man right by, you know, Stanley and Steve Ditko, right?

1060
01:02:56,441 --> 01:03:16,479
Scott: Uh, and then if you want to find other good Spider-Man's right, look for Spider-Man that is written by, uh, Dan slot, or if you're like in the spider verse, which you should be find some miles Morales Spider-Man or this end or some ultimate Spider-Man, uh, which you can, you know, just start reading from like issue one or whatever.

1061
01:03:16,708 --> 01:03:16,959
Scott: Right.

1062
01:03:17,684 --> 01:03:20,140
Scott: Uh, and those are going to be like, you know, you're good.

1063
01:03:20,481 --> 01:03:32,898
Scott: Go to Spider-Man's to start, you know, if you just want to read some Spider-Man comic, uh, Spider-Man 2099 is not really going to give you, it's going to give you some Spider-Man, but like I said, it's mostly going to give you some cyberpunk, which is also good.

1064
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:45,320
Rym: I guess one nice thing though, is that most Spider-Man media is more close to the mean compared to other superheroes where like you read the wrong one and it's just super weird and the wrong is Spider-Man.

1065
01:03:45,462 --> 01:03:46,035
Scott: There's an infant.

1066
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:47,600
Scott: I have it all over here actually.

1067
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:59,039
Scott: Cause I want, I have five giant books, which I'm going to read and then get rid of, uh, there's an infamous Spider-Man, the clone saga, which is, uh, where that, the Jackal that you mentioned, right?

1068
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:05,319
Scott: Basically this whole thing gets messed up where there's another guy who Spider-Man doesn't know he's Spider-Man.

1069
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:10,040
Scott: There's a possibly a clone of Spider-Man and it's like all mixed up, right?

1070
01:04:10,181 --> 01:04:14,238
Scott: Like the, the, the guy who is Peter Parker doesn't know he is anymore.

1071
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:20,798
Scott: The memories get, and basically it's the derided, you know, island episodes of, of Spider-Man.

1072
01:04:21,305 --> 01:04:21,519
Rym: Yeah.

1073
01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:26,519
Rym: Which a media franchise this big, like an IP this big, there's going to be some Island episodes.

1074
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:27,619
Rym: There's no way to avoid that.

1075
01:04:28,460 --> 01:04:35,580
Scott: Another, also, if you, if you want to read some good Spider-Man, I could also recommend, I don't know exactly what issues it is, but you could find it easily by Googling.

1076
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:37,219
Scott: I'm sure there's trade paperbacks of it.

1077
01:04:37,580 --> 01:04:43,599
Scott: There is the point at which I guess there was secret wars and it's during secret wars, which is a big crossover event, right?

1078
01:04:44,242 --> 01:04:48,200
Scott: Uh, Spider-Man finds a, so, uh, basically effectively a space sewing machine.

1079
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:54,700
Scott: And in the space sewing machine, he sews himself the black costume, right.

1080
01:04:54,741 --> 01:04:55,297
Scott: And puts it on.

1081
01:04:56,081 --> 01:05:00,220
Scott: Um, and the black costume is obviously an alien that later becomes venom.

1082
01:05:00,260 --> 01:05:01,200
Scott: It's not just a costume.

1083
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:03,440
Rym: But there's a whole arc that like leads to that.

1084
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:06,319
Rym: Like people didn't know what this, what this was when they read this.

1085
01:05:06,541 --> 01:05:09,080
Scott: So you could read secret wars if you want to.

1086
01:05:09,181 --> 01:05:09,940
Scott: It's not that bad.

1087
01:05:10,322 --> 01:05:15,740
Scott: Uh, it's, it's, you know, it's, it's dated, but it's still a bit, it's one of the earlier comic crossover things.

1088
01:05:15,842 --> 01:05:16,619
Scott: You can understand it.

1089
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:19,080
Scott: If you read it, you don't need to actually read all the crossover issues.

1090
01:05:19,681 --> 01:05:23,340
Scott: Um, but you read the Spider-Man comics that directly follow after that.

1091
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:26,360
Scott: And they're easy to find because Spider-Man is wearing a different costume.

1092
01:05:26,891 --> 01:05:27,080
Scott: Right.

1093
01:05:27,661 --> 01:05:36,620
Scott: Uh, and if you read those and the saga of Spider-Man having that costume up to the point at which he gets rid of it and it becomes venom, right.

1094
01:05:36,762 --> 01:05:38,039
Scott: When it finds another host.

1095
01:05:38,805 --> 01:05:41,120
Scott: Um, those are pretty good Spider-Man's to read also.

1096
01:05:41,346 --> 01:05:41,560
Rym: Yeah.

1097
01:05:41,761 --> 01:05:43,460
Rym: I've actually read a bunch of that.

1098
01:05:43,821 --> 01:05:47,960
Rym: I'm weirdly more familiar with the venom stuff than I am with Spider-Man stuff from that era.

1099
01:05:48,183 --> 01:05:48,251
Rym: Yep.

1100
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:51,760
Scott: So I guess that might be like, I don't know exactly when that was.

1101
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:53,400
Scott: Was that late eighties, early nineties?

1102
01:05:54,985 --> 01:05:57,900
Rym: Uh, this Wikipedia page is too long for me to scroll and find that right now.

1103
01:05:57,980 --> 01:05:58,416
Scott: Of course it is.

1104
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:01,420
Scott: Secret wars came out in 84.

1105
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:02,819
Scott: So I guess mid, mid eighties.

1106
01:06:03,180 --> 01:06:03,538
Scott: Oh, here we go.

1107
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:05,210
Rym: Spider-Man 252, 1984, the black costume debut.

1108
01:06:07,729 --> 01:06:07,857
Scott: Yep.

1109
01:06:08,102 --> 01:06:10,300
Rym: That brought controversy to many fans.

1110
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:14,180
Rym: The suit was later revealed as an alien semi-aut and was okay.

1111
01:06:15,043 --> 01:06:15,538
Rym: Thanks Wikipedia.

1112
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:17,910
Scott: There you go.

1113
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:21,396
Rym: So yeah, check out some Spider-Man's.

1127
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:26,239
Rym: We're going to something cool that we can't talk about yet, but we got something cool in the hopper.

1128
01:07:26,741 --> 01:07:29,000
Rym: We actually had a meeting about said cool thing today.

1129
01:07:29,641 --> 01:07:33,838
Rym: So, uh, we'll see where this goes, but you might see some things in the next, give it a month or so.

1130
01:07:34,623 --> 01:07:35,659
Rym: And I'll just leave it at that.

1131
