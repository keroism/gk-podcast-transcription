1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,078
Rym: It's Wednesday, November 11th, 2020.

2
00:00:10,078 --> 00:00:10,280
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,214 --> 00:00:13,525
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,558
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight.

5
00:00:15,618 --> 00:00:17,909
Rym: We are reviewing the anime Deca-Dence.

6
00:00:19,691 --> 00:00:20,709
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:21,991 --> 00:00:29,019
Rym: You know, it's been a thousand years since March and like the date doesn't mean anything to me anymore.

8
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,786
Rym: Like it never matters what day it is.

9
00:00:30,826 --> 00:00:33,828
Rym: Like I gotta look like Oh, what fucking day is it when I'm gonna say it?

10
00:00:34,211 --> 00:00:35,770
Scott: It matters if it's a Saturday or a Sunday.

11
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:37,419
Rym: It matters what day of the week it is.

12
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:39,550
Rym: It does not matter what the number is on the day.

13
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:49,060
Scott: No, because the calendar only matters for special events and if all special events are canceled then why does it matter what the calendar day is, right?

14
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,365
Scott: It's not gonna be packs.

15
00:00:50,405 --> 00:00:51,308
Scott: It's not gonna be a holiday.

16
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,605
Scott: You know, it's like oh, it'll be Thanksgiving, but you won't be doing anything.

17
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:55,550
Scott: So what does it matter, right?

18
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:56,428
Scott: It's just another Thursday.

19
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:57,310
Scott: Exactly.

20
00:00:59,714 --> 00:01:02,110
Scott: Do I have to work from home or just stay at home?

21
00:01:02,652 --> 00:01:11,910
Rym: But I noticed just now that today is 11/11, which there's a holiday not that it matters to us especially in America people barely celebrate Veterans Day or Armistice Day.

22
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,190
Scott: We have a different Veterans Day.

23
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:18,030
Rym: But Armistice Day has a weirdly tragic story.

24
00:01:18,832 --> 00:01:21,019
Rym: I've learned a lot about World War One because I'm weird.

25
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:21,922
Rym: I may not like that.

26
00:01:22,504 --> 00:01:27,349
Rym: And World War One is a complex tapestry of bullshit that I do not want to get into right now.

27
00:01:28,311 --> 00:01:31,830
Rym: There's a lot of complexity to what the hell was going on in World War One.

28
00:01:32,331 --> 00:01:39,842
Rym: But the thing that's always struck me is that Armistice Day was on the 11th hour, the 11th day of the 11th month.

29
00:01:42,071 --> 00:01:43,660
Rym: And that wasn't a coincidence.

30
00:01:44,263 --> 00:01:51,550
Rym: The powers that be kind of did that on purpose because it was a cool number and people literally died because of that.

31
00:01:53,411 --> 00:01:54,757
Rym: And I don't know how many people know that.

32
00:01:55,098 --> 00:02:11,208
Rym: but if you're ever in a position where you are prosecuting a defensive war against an aggressive and belligerent enemy and you have an opportunity for peace and you delay the opportunity for peace or at least a truce in order to make a cool number appear somewhere.

33
00:02:11,228 --> 00:02:11,870
Rym: Fuck you.

34
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:13,683
Rym: Like do the right thing.

35
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:20,448
Scott: The fact that these people had already been the people who had the power to end the war, right?

36
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:24,062
Scott: We're also the people who chose to start the war.

37
00:02:24,082 --> 00:02:26,130
Scott: So already fuck them.

38
00:02:26,611 --> 00:02:33,210
Rym: Well, it's complicated because on one hand a lot of powers were culpable for starting World War One.

39
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:37,102
Rym: But on the other hand, I will stand by.

40
00:02:37,162 --> 00:02:39,530
Rym: In fact, the last time I was in Australia.

41
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:43,329
Rym: I ended up getting into an argument with a bunch of strangers about this topic.

42
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:55,609
Rym: But I would say that Germany was primarily culpable for the continuance of World War One due to their continuing territorial aggression and then their unwillingness to exceed the fact that that did not work.

43
00:02:56,152 --> 00:03:06,110
Rym: But anyway, Armistice Day is a day and that's literally the only interesting thing I can think to talk about in my life since nothing's happened since Monday.

44
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:08,749
Scott: Nope, not really.

45
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,897
Rym: Yeah, so let's get right into some anime news.

46
00:03:11,957 --> 00:03:15,028
Rym: It's actually really, it's news that needed to come.

47
00:03:15,068 --> 00:03:15,730
Rym: I'm glad it came.

48
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,177
Rym: I was worried that it wouldn't come.

49
00:03:17,619 --> 00:03:25,255
Rym: Like I was actually kind of worried about this but Katsucon has finally, correctly, canceled for 2021.

50
00:03:25,255 --> 00:03:25,944
Scott: Oh, finally.

51
00:03:26,127 --> 00:03:26,228
Scott: Oof.

52
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:32,790
Rym: I won't share any rumors of any internal things in detail because they're just rumors.

53
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:42,807
Rym: But basically it is notable that Katsucon waited so long to cancel when other cons that happen around the same time canceled a while ago.

54
00:03:44,455 --> 00:03:45,969
Rym: Like I'm surprised it took this long.

55
00:03:47,451 --> 00:03:50,887
Scott: I'm not, I mean, you know based on what I know, I'm not surprised.

56
00:03:50,947 --> 00:03:51,349
Scott: I'm just.

57
00:03:53,371 --> 00:03:54,073
Scott: It's hard, I guess it.

58
00:03:54,093 --> 00:03:58,850
Scott: can you be disappointed if you expect, it's like if you if it met your low expectations.

59
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:08,878
Rym: Yeah, like I kind of stopped going to Katsucon when the staff thing happened, but that was so long ago that Katsucon has had much drama that I will not go into.

60
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:11,309
Rym: But that drama was like a decade ago.

61
00:04:12,053 --> 00:04:15,510
Rym: We never even attended the new reformed Katsucon.

62
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:20,930
Scott: No, no, I barely know what's going on since that drama with Katsucon all those many many years ago.

63
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:30,930
Scott: But it, you know, because of that incident, right, I now in my mind give Katsucon a reputation for being a drama, you know, infused con, right?

64
00:04:32,486 --> 00:04:48,129
Scott: And this piece of information, you know, the the whispers that I've heard through who knows what grapevines that, you know, they were doing their best to try to make their event happen instead of, you know, if I ran a convention, I would be doing my best to not make it happen.

65
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:59,227
Rym: Yeah, like the biggest danger right now are these conventions that are nonprofits where the state that they're in is a shitty state and won't like order them to cancel.

66
00:04:59,548 --> 00:05:02,670
Rym: and thus they're because of stupid laws and stupid contracts.

67
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:07,165
Scott: MagFest, which is in the same exact building as Katsucon, right?

68
00:05:07,186 --> 00:05:08,330
Scott: It's literally the same place.

69
00:05:08,674 --> 00:05:10,009
Scott: Very close to the same time.

70
00:05:11,851 --> 00:05:14,557
Scott: You know, it held back a little bit.

71
00:05:14,617 --> 00:05:17,370
Scott: They tried a little bit, but then they're like, okay, no, right?

72
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:24,688
Scott: Most of the people that most of the staff I think that I am aware of were like, yeah, no, if you have it I'm not coming if you have it, right, etc.

73
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:31,050
Scott: So they didn't like Katsucon, look how long Katsucon held out until literally today.

74
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,836
Scott: So they decided to cancel.

75
00:05:32,977 --> 00:05:35,410
Rym: They did issue follow-up statements.

76
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:44,148
Rym: They said, I'll skip through a lot of this, "Please know that there were many logistical and legal steps to take before we could announce

77
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:44,409
Rym: this.".

78
00:05:44,971 --> 00:05:45,595
Scott: That is true.

79
00:05:45,977 --> 00:05:47,446
Scott: That is not incorrect.

80
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,921
Rym: Yeah, and we've talked about this a bunch of times.

81
00:05:49,981 --> 00:05:51,190
Rym: I'm not gonna go deep into it again.

82
00:05:51,290 --> 00:06:04,350
Rym: But for all of you out there who are disappointed that a con's canceled or who are mad that a con is not canceled yet, the thing to bear in mind is that contract law and like the way this works in America is really, really stupid.

83
00:06:05,072 --> 00:06:07,490
Scott: And I'm sure it works stupidly in other countries as well.

84
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,670
Scott: Every country on earth has contracts.

85
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,071
Rym: Oh, yeah.

86
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:16,290
Rym: But American contracts, like in particular, part of what's going on is that America did not handle COVID well.

87
00:06:16,952 --> 00:06:20,310
Rym: That is the understatement because Republicans were in power.

88
00:06:20,871 --> 00:06:30,550
Rym: But as a result, not only is COVID not calming down to a steady state, like it's rising everywhere in the world, but it is rising at a catastrophic rate in America.

89
00:06:31,294 --> 00:06:32,170
Scott: Maybe we saw that coming.

90
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:35,628
Scott: We were like, you know, in the summer, we were like, "Yeah, it's gonna way be bad when it gets cold

91
00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:35,870
Scott: again.".

92
00:06:35,993 --> 00:06:36,468
Scott: And we were right.

93
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:37,032
Rym: Yep.

94
00:06:37,559 --> 00:06:38,350
Rym: A lot of things opened up.

95
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,629
Scott: I didn't want to be right, but we're right.

96
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:42,191
Rym: Yep.

97
00:06:42,493 --> 00:06:45,107
Rym: Now, the tricky part is a lot of people are saying, "Oh, we'll just go

98
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:45,530
Rym: online.".

99
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:46,203
Rym: Like, "I'm just trying to go

100
00:06:46,244 --> 00:06:46,530
Rym: online.".

101
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:49,370
Rym: But I got to tell you, I've been involved in a lot of online cons up to this point.

102
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:50,472
Rym: They're doing their best.

103
00:06:51,053 --> 00:06:59,050
Rym: However, online cons do not present a compelling story for most of the people who would attend a con.

104
00:06:59,892 --> 00:07:00,073
Scott: Right.

105
00:07:00,193 --> 00:07:03,370
Scott: Online cons do, you know, are a thing, right?

106
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:10,110
Scott: But basically, they're just, you know, even if you do all the best stuff that you can do at the online con.

107
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,649
Rym: You can have a bunch of panels and some discords to hang out in.

108
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:13,070
Scott: Right.

109
00:07:13,251 --> 00:07:19,970
Scott: You are not making something that replaces the in-person con or serves the same purpose.

110
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:22,999
Scott: You are just, you know, doing what.

111
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:30,190
Scott: you have a company and you're doing what you can with your resources, plus the internet, to make money and engage your audience.

112
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:30,771
Scott: Right.

113
00:07:30,831 --> 00:07:33,309
Scott: But you are not replacing the thing you actually do.

114
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:37,690
Rym: And that's why, like, I think I hope God's Gun does try to do something online.

115
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:46,930
Rym: I like that cons are doing this because they're basically doing it, one, to keep their brand afloat, two, to give their staff something to do, and three, just to, like, do something for the community they work with.

116
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:51,490
Rym: Like, hey, if you run a con, usually you're running it because you want a cool thing to happen.

117
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:54,150
Rym: Why not do the coolest thing you can do under the circumstances?

118
00:07:54,812 --> 00:08:02,030
Rym: But it is basically impossible to charge any amount of money for an online con, except in rare circumstances.

119
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:03,598
Scott: It depends.

120
00:08:04,106 --> 00:08:04,207
Rym: Yeah.

121
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:04,731
Rym: Yeah.

122
00:08:04,912 --> 00:08:08,810
Rym: And online cons do cost money to run for a lot of reasons.

123
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:10,489
Rym: So we'll see what happens.

124
00:08:10,951 --> 00:08:15,589
Rym: But I just don't think there's going to be any cons in 2021 the way America is going right now.

125
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:17,042
Scott: Who knows?

126
00:08:18,771 --> 00:08:22,230
Rym: So at least the other thing that I can say is I was scrolling through all these tweets.

127
00:08:23,353 --> 00:08:25,490
Rym: Very few people are mad about this.

128
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:33,210
Rym: Everyone seems to be taking this the right way, which is actually very heartening compared to how some people reacted to other cons being canceled last year.

129
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:35,587
Rym: Well, last year, earlier this year.

130
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:37,832
Rym: God damn it.

131
00:08:37,952 --> 00:08:42,010
Scott: Anyway, anyway, so tiny news here, right?

132
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:49,790
Scott: So we did a GeekNights episode on season one of Beastars, which is an AA anime, Beastars is great.

133
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:51,087
Scott: It's pretty good.

134
00:08:51,692 --> 00:08:57,469
Scott: And season two, we knew was coming eventually, but now we know it's coming January 5th, so January 5th.

135
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:58,717
Scott: And you know how Netflix do.

136
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,630
Scott: every episode is going to be there all at once.

137
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:01,030
Scott: Right.

138
00:09:01,051 --> 00:09:04,910
Scott: So on January 5th, you'll be able to watch all of Beastars season two.

139
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:05,573
Rym: I'm excited.

140
00:09:05,714 --> 00:09:08,790
Rym: I like this giant snake guy we're looking at here.

141
00:09:09,471 --> 00:09:09,974
Scott: Yeah, we haven't.

142
00:09:10,034 --> 00:09:12,950
Scott: I was wondering about, you know, those kinds of animals.

143
00:09:13,331 --> 00:09:16,089
Rym: But especially because this snake is gigantic.

144
00:09:17,532 --> 00:09:18,041
Scott: Yep, yep, yep.

145
00:09:18,082 --> 00:09:18,529
Scott: All right.

146
00:09:19,052 --> 00:09:20,450
Scott: Other tiny news, right?

147
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:24,650
Scott: So there's an anime called Venus Wars that was a big deal in the U.S.

148
00:09:24,951 --> 00:09:25,719
Scott: in the 90s, late 90s.

149
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,390
Scott: It was, you know, it was a sci-fi channel.

150
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,390
Scott: Was it actually on sci-fi?

151
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,244
Rym: It was on sci-fi network.

152
00:09:32,151 --> 00:09:37,970
Scott: I'm pretty sure because I remember it was one of those few anime that were dubbed in the U.S.

153
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:38,533
Scott: early.

154
00:09:38,553 --> 00:09:41,870
Rym: I rented it from Blockbuster and copied that VHS tape.

155
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:42,291
Scott: Yeah.

156
00:09:42,633 --> 00:09:44,609
Scott: How notable and good is it really?

157
00:09:45,411 --> 00:09:45,612
Scott: Right.

158
00:09:45,693 --> 00:09:51,270
Scott: If it wasn't for the fact that it was one of those few anime that was distributed in the U.S.

159
00:09:51,371 --> 00:09:53,590
Scott: in those days, would it even be known today?

160
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:54,031
Rym: You know what?

161
00:09:54,071 --> 00:09:54,693
Rym: It's interesting.

162
00:09:54,954 --> 00:10:00,615
Rym: I really liked it as a kid and it was good, but it basically doesn't have an ending.

163
00:10:00,636 --> 00:10:02,685
Rym: like it's a kind of one of those real war stories.

164
00:10:02,765 --> 00:10:14,350
Rym: like take a little bit of Akira aesthetics, not the crazy stuff, but just like the bike stuff, coupled with some little bit of mech stuff, but more like big tanks and make it a Red Dawn situation.

165
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,722
Rym: A bunch of punk kids trying to fight against this occupation.

166
00:10:17,144 --> 00:10:21,390
Rym: like it's kind of a real war story, but the end just doesn't fucking go anywhere.

167
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:23,470
Rym: Like this movie just ends on nothing.

168
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,069
Scott: So anyway, did we ever review it?

169
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:35,770
Scott: No, we thought we talked about reviewing it several times, but we only had a video CD that we got for free at a con somewhere.

170
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:40,305
Rym: The only mention on our site about Venus Wars is in the out of date.

171
00:10:40,386 --> 00:10:42,989
Rym: I forgot this existed about Rym page.

172
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:47,830
Scott: Anyway, so why is Venus Wars make your about Rym page?

173
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:54,229
Rym: When he was nine, he saw his first anime, Vampire Hunter D, Robot Carnival, Project Echo, Venus Wars.

174
00:10:55,130 --> 00:11:02,930
Scott: OK, anyway, so by this show, Sentai Filmworks has license rescued it from wherever it was.

175
00:11:03,832 --> 00:11:07,708
Scott: So it's going to be available to watch again easily soon.

176
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,760
Scott: Now, I don't know exactly what actually like.

177
00:11:10,982 --> 00:11:12,589
Scott: I'm glad I got the article and read it.

178
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:29,473
Scott: So, you know, regardless of whether this thing's any frickin good or worth watching in the year 2020, it does have a significance to the history of anime in the United States only and may be worth the time it takes to watch a single movie just to know what the deal was.

179
00:11:29,493 --> 00:11:33,290
Scott: But yeah, it's going to be easy to do that soon or maybe even now.

180
00:11:33,432 --> 00:11:34,610
Scott: Click on the article, get the date.

181
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:35,052
Scott: I don't know.

182
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:37,930
Rym: Yeah, it's got a few like really good iconic scenes.

183
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:40,630
Rym: Like there's a scene with the reporter and her camera that's really tense.

184
00:11:40,851 --> 00:11:43,469
Rym: But yeah, just don't expect this movie to end.

185
00:11:44,992 --> 00:11:45,112
Scott: Right.

186
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:52,470
Scott: In some other news, we got a good news, bad news here from maybe the best anime distributor/publisher.

187
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:53,488
Scott: I don't know what they count as.

188
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:56,730
Rym: And why are these two news on the same page?

189
00:11:57,734 --> 00:11:58,869
Scott: Because they're both discotheque.

190
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,190
Scott: Discotheque made two announcements.

191
00:12:00,671 --> 00:12:03,930
Scott: It was a single press release in discotheque announcing two things they're doing.

192
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:07,549
Scott: So the first thing discotheque is doing, we'll do bad news first, right?

193
00:12:08,312 --> 00:12:13,169
Scott: Is there is an OAV, an OVA, kind of not super old, but kind of old one.

194
00:12:14,671 --> 00:12:19,027
Scott: And they're releasing, they're re-releasing it and it is called Kiss X Sis.

195
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:26,170
Scott: And you're probably thinking, listen to the name of that anime and thinking about what is an anime called Kiss X Sis about?

196
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:31,829
Rym: Well, it's either Hunter X Hunter, like Hunter X Hunter kind of situation or it's incest porn.

197
00:12:32,851 --> 00:12:35,590
Scott: It is absolutely incest porn.

198
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,350
Scott: This anime is so bad.

199
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:46,410
Scott: This is like, you know, we make fun of a lot of animes, especially when we're judging animes about like, we're like, we get a whiff and we're like, stay away from this.

200
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:54,129
Rym: It's like, you know, I feel like I say Kiss X Sis sometimes as like, oh, this is going to be a Kiss X Sis situation.

201
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:54,854
Scott: This is worse.

202
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:56,910
Scott: I think Kiss X Sis is worse than like Chubra.

203
00:12:57,231 --> 00:12:58,149
Scott: This is like, oh, for sure.

204
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:01,850
Rym: Chubra is positively tame compared to this bullshit.

205
00:13:02,271 --> 00:13:12,050
Scott: In fact, there are things that are just like, you know, actual hentai, right, that are less distasteful than Kiss X Sis, right?

206
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:16,610
Scott: Because you have an actual hentai where like people are having consensual sex.

207
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:21,697
Scott: You know, it might be drawn in a way to subjectifying people and has other problems with it.

208
00:13:21,838 --> 00:13:22,020
Scott: Right.

209
00:13:22,061 --> 00:13:22,810
Scott: It's not perfect.

210
00:13:23,271 --> 00:13:32,586
Scott: But Kiss X Sis is this dude has two sisters, literal sisters who want him to pay step sisters.

211
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:34,613
Scott: Right.

212
00:13:34,693 --> 00:13:37,970
Scott: And I'm pretty sure these people are too young, I'm guessing.

213
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:39,576
Rym: I mean, it's anime.

214
00:13:39,616 --> 00:13:42,270
Scott: So I have not looked into that many details.

215
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,179
Scott: I just know enough.

216
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,189
Scott: And that's all I know.

217
00:13:44,371 --> 00:13:45,619
Scott: And that's enough to know.

218
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:47,210
Scott: this is the worst thing ever.

219
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:48,430
Scott: Why are they bringing this back?

220
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:57,089
Rym: But I guess they like the ad copy, like the copy from the press release, like specifically calls it out as a taboo breaking love bloom.

221
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:58,418
Rym: Like, yeah.

222
00:13:59,144 --> 00:13:59,830
Scott: Yeah, that's what it is.

223
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:00,540
Rym: They know what it is.

224
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,250
Rym: They're marketing it.

225
00:14:01,391 --> 00:14:08,435
Scott: And that so having to be aware of the existence of Kiss X Sis is the price we have to pay for a discotheque.

226
00:14:08,455 --> 00:14:17,710
Scott: to also announce they are re-releasing one of the best Lupin movies, the Miyazaki one, the one that's not like any other Lupin movie.

227
00:14:18,353 --> 00:14:18,900
Scott: That's right.

228
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,750
Scott: But it's still amazing.

229
00:14:20,171 --> 00:14:28,585
Scott: The most famous one, Castle of Cagliostro is getting released again this time in on a UHD Bure, which is 4K Bure.

230
00:14:30,192 --> 00:14:31,849
Scott: So you can wait for someone to rip that.

231
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:40,450
Scott: And basically they had, you know, unlike a lot of other things, they try to re-release where they can't get like, you know, Project Aco, we can't find the material.

232
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,609
Rym: We're literally using this laser disc.

233
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,217
Scott: Exactly right.

234
00:14:44,419 --> 00:14:45,830
Scott: It's not one of those situations.

235
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,730
Scott: This is like they have this.

236
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,730
Scott: They have all kinds of material from this.

237
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:57,590
Scott: In fact, it's going to include original like Japanese seven point one audio that they have for ultra surround sound and shit.

238
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:13,713
Scott: So this is probably going to be all indications, the ultimate home release, like you cannot beat this short of going to a theater and maybe even going to a theater with film wouldn't be as good maybe as what they are about to release, like the ultimate edition of this anime.

239
00:15:13,753 --> 00:15:16,521
Scott: So I wouldn't.

240
00:15:16,922 --> 00:15:24,070
Scott: I personally don't buy physical media, but, you know, if you do or if you can get a pirated rip of this or whatever, it's coming.

241
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,170
Scott: And that's that's exciting.

242
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,310
Rym: Yeah, I think we would give it a rewatch.

243
00:15:27,471 --> 00:15:36,610
Rym: We're living in an era where a lot of anime is getting remastered and rereleased basically at the best possible quality that is possible, possible, possible, possible.

244
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:37,688
Rym: I said that a bunch of times.

245
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:38,832
Scott: All right.

246
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:41,129
Scott: So that's that's an excellent news.

247
00:15:41,653 --> 00:15:43,430
Scott: And I just want to mention this one other thing.

248
00:15:43,893 --> 00:15:45,870
Scott: I don't know if you've ever judged this show.

249
00:15:46,091 --> 00:15:46,918
Scott: I've never seen it.

250
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:48,409
Scott: I don't know if there's a manga about it.

251
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,154
Scott: I think there might be.

252
00:15:49,174 --> 00:15:51,650
Rym: I don't think we judged it because I would remember this title.

253
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:52,971
Scott: Yeah.

254
00:15:53,011 --> 00:15:59,370
Scott: So I basically well, I think we might have seen the title in Japanese, but basically there's an anime, maybe manga.

255
00:15:59,550 --> 00:15:59,813
Scott: I don't know.

256
00:15:59,873 --> 00:16:01,670
Scott: I have to go to Wikipedia and Google it.

257
00:16:01,851 --> 00:16:02,950
Scott: I didn't do that before the show.

258
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:03,454
Scott: I'm sorry.

259
00:16:03,818 --> 00:16:05,070
Scott: But there's an anime that's coming.

260
00:16:05,951 --> 00:16:10,650
Scott: And all I know about it is the synopsis of the plot and the synopsis of the plot.

261
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:13,650
Scott: It doesn't seem like it's going to be a great all time anime.

262
00:16:13,991 --> 00:16:16,030
Scott: I'm not going to lie and be like, oh, this is going to be amazing.

263
00:16:16,451 --> 00:16:21,148
Scott: But the concept of the show seems so fun that I just I'm going to like.

264
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:22,593
Scott: it makes me want to go check it out.

265
00:16:22,613 --> 00:16:29,450
Scott: So here's the show is called in English, Suppose a Kid from the Last Dungeon Boonies Moved to a Starter Town.

266
00:16:29,851 --> 00:16:38,256
Scott: So this is obviously, you know, one of those shows where the world is a fantasy world that works like.

267
00:16:38,337 --> 00:16:40,589
Rym: it's basically basically Takumi from Initial D.

268
00:16:41,632 --> 00:16:41,873
Scott: Right.

269
00:16:42,195 --> 00:16:45,090
Scott: It's a. it's a world where it's a fantasy world.

270
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:55,715
Scott: It's not a video game thing, but it's where the world works the way an RPG works the same way as like Delicious and Dungeon, where the world works the way an RPG works, even though it's not.

271
00:16:55,775 --> 00:16:58,430
Scott: it's not about real people in the real world going into a game.

272
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,770
Scott: It's just a world that works the way a game works.

273
00:17:02,251 --> 00:17:06,890
Scott: And in this world, there's this tiny little kid, right, who's mad weak.

274
00:17:07,451 --> 00:17:10,790
Scott: He's he's so weak compared to like all his friends and family.

275
00:17:10,912 --> 00:17:12,029
Scott: He's just so sad and weak.

276
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:12,771
Scott: Right.

277
00:17:13,473 --> 00:17:19,410
Scott: So he leaves his home and he goes to like the starter tutorial town of the world.

278
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:19,977
Scott: Right.

279
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:20,748
Scott: Wherever that is.

280
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,730
Rym: Let's go to Canaria and I'm going to figure go fight Garland.

281
00:17:23,931 --> 00:17:28,029
Rym: That's a basic moves venture for parties level one to three.

282
00:17:28,812 --> 00:17:28,993
Scott: Right.

283
00:17:29,013 --> 00:17:32,870
Scott: He moves to to Canaria, right, to parties one to three go.

284
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:47,050
Scott: And it just turns out that where he comes from is a village that is sitting right next to directly adjacent to the most dangerous final boss dungeon in the entire world.

285
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,290
Rym: Like basically the tomb of horrors is right there.

286
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:49,691
Scott: Right.

287
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:50,374
Scott: Right.

288
00:17:50,394 --> 00:17:53,550
Scott: So he was the weakest kid in his town, so weak that he left.

289
00:17:53,671 --> 00:17:56,429
Scott: And moved away because, you know, everyone else is so much stronger than him.

290
00:17:57,131 --> 00:18:00,750
Scott: And he goes to the tutorial town, but in which he is basically God tier.

291
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:01,826
Scott: But he looks like a little kid.

292
00:18:01,927 --> 00:18:02,049
Scott: Right.

293
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:06,570
Scott: So just that concept is such an anime manga concept.

294
00:18:06,911 --> 00:18:07,272
Scott: Right.

295
00:18:07,413 --> 00:18:07,875
Scott: You can't.

296
00:18:08,638 --> 00:18:11,955
Scott: it's like if you just told me that plot, I would say that plot is definitely an anime plot.

297
00:18:11,995 --> 00:18:13,849
Scott: There's no way that that's something else.

298
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,115
Rym: I love the whole thing.

299
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:20,670
Rym: The title of the anime is, quote, Suppose a kid from the last dungeon booties booties moved to a starter town.

300
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:21,652
Scott: Yes.

301
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:30,250
Scott: And it's like, wow, that seems like, you know, not going to be the greatest show, but it seems like it could be a lot of fun if they don't spend too long on battles.

302
00:18:30,893 --> 00:18:32,149
Scott: That could be a really fun show.

303
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,489
Rym: It has a little bit of a concept.

304
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:35,348
Rym: It could be like Goku, though.

305
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:36,889
Rym: If anyone remembers, it could be.

306
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:37,678
Rym: I like Goku.

307
00:18:37,698 --> 00:18:38,670
Scott: So I'm right.

308
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,410
Scott: So I'm kind of interested based on just the concept alone.

309
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:41,892
Scott: I want to.

310
00:18:41,993 --> 00:18:45,234
Scott: I think I'm like, you know, I want to give this show a chance to see what the deal is.

311
00:18:45,255 --> 00:18:45,802
Scott: It might be funny.

312
00:18:46,046 --> 00:18:46,269
Scott: Yeah.

313
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:48,709
Scott: So in another I tell people it exists.

314
00:18:49,071 --> 00:18:49,834
Rym: Another small news.

315
00:18:49,855 --> 00:18:57,250
Rym: If you didn't see, as we know, HBO is bringing out one by one hour long Adventure Time continuing specials set throughout different.

316
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,219
Scott: Did we do an episode?

317
00:18:58,239 --> 00:18:59,350
Scott: We did an episode of the BMO one.

318
00:18:59,430 --> 00:18:59,814
Scott: Yeah, we did.

319
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:01,290
Rym: So the next one is coming.

320
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,530
Rym: The Marceline and Bubblegum won Obsidian.

321
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:04,890
Rym: We they just dropped.

322
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,990
Scott: I thought that would be the final one, but I guess not.

323
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:07,371
Scott: Yeah.

324
00:19:07,432 --> 00:19:09,309
Rym: The final one is supposedly just Finn and Jake again.

325
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:14,776
Scott: Yeah, I thought that, you know, I thought it wouldn't be shocked if they make more after these four.

326
00:19:14,837 --> 00:19:15,749
Rym: They seem to be doing well.

327
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,590
Scott: We'll see how many people, you know, they'll do whatever they want to do.

328
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:18,812
Scott: Yeah.

329
00:19:19,094 --> 00:19:21,290
Rym: But Distant Lands, Obsidian.

330
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:22,768
Rym: We have the trailer for it.

331
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:30,010
Rym: And remember in the beginning when Marceline first gets introduced and she's like, oh, I was on vacation and it shows like hula hooping in some lava.

332
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:39,730
Rym: Pretty sure the place with the lava is the place that they go to in this one because there's the lava and the dragon and like the crystal glass people.

333
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:42,541
Scott: But the fact that they're together means it's not.

334
00:19:42,762 --> 00:19:44,813
Scott: it's not a story about Marceline's vacation.

335
00:19:44,853 --> 00:19:47,990
Scott: It definitely takes place after the end of Adventure Time based on the trailer.

336
00:19:48,452 --> 00:19:48,633
Rym: Yeah.

337
00:19:48,653 --> 00:19:58,756
Rym: Based on the trailer, the end of the TV 90 percent, it takes place after the end of the show or it takes place possibly during that brief era where Marceline and Bubblegum were like dating.

338
00:19:58,816 --> 00:20:00,689
Rym: But like the Candy Kingdom wasn't fully formed.

339
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:01,695
Rym: It's not clear.

340
00:20:01,716 --> 00:20:02,868
Scott: I don't.

341
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,097
Scott: Yeah, I don't think that's what it is.

342
00:20:04,157 --> 00:20:05,729
Rym: Pretty sure it just takes place at the end.

343
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:11,574
Scott: Yes, I'm pretty sure it takes place after the end of the TV show, unlike the BMO one, which takes place.

344
00:20:12,118 --> 00:20:13,929
Rym: Well, spoiler to say when that one takes place.

345
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:15,154
Scott: Yeah, sure.

346
00:20:15,194 --> 00:20:15,597
Scott: Whatever.

347
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,550
Rym: But the BMO one was great.

348
00:20:17,671 --> 00:20:19,389
Rym: So I'm actually really excited about this one.

349
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:27,210
Scott: The trailer for this one actually makes it look like it's going to be, I don't know, I want to say better, but like it goes harder.

350
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:28,172
Rym: I think so.

351
00:20:28,232 --> 00:20:32,755
Rym: Like it starts with like Marceline and Bubblegum are definitely in a committed direct relationship.

352
00:20:32,795 --> 00:20:35,688
Rym: Like they're not dancing around that like they had to in this one.

353
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:36,896
Scott: This one's good.

354
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,189
Scott: This one's going hard.

355
00:20:38,511 --> 00:20:40,730
Scott: So if you're an Adventure Time fan, it's good news.

356
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,178
Rym: I mean, they're going to fight a dragon.

357
00:20:42,218 --> 00:20:44,050
Rym: There's a very like direct narrative here.

358
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:48,730
Rym: The BMO one was very like interesting and told a story around the edges.

359
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,599
Rym: This one, I think, is just going to be a direct.

360
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,810
Rym: Marceline goes and fucks up this dragon via confronting trauma in some fashion.

361
00:20:56,085 --> 00:20:56,247
Scott: Yep.

362
00:20:56,268 --> 00:20:56,308
Scott: OK.

363
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:06,920
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

364
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,187
Rym: What do you got?

365
00:21:09,207 --> 00:21:16,100
Scott: So I'm going to continue my tradition of using non things that don't match the GeekNights' day for a thing of the day.

366
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,063
Scott: Right.

367
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:20,200
Scott: So I found out about this like a while ago.

368
00:21:20,482 --> 00:21:22,920
Scott: Actually, and it was just so interesting.

369
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:34,779
Scott: Apparently, people say that there are some authors and writers out there, prominent ones, most notably the Game of Thrones guy, although I don't know if you can call himself a writer because what has he written recently?

370
00:21:37,325 --> 00:21:37,851
Scott: The R.R.

371
00:21:37,912 --> 00:21:38,540
Scott: Martin, whatever.

372
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,301
Scott: Yeah.

373
00:21:39,542 --> 00:21:40,183
Scott: Old beard guy.

374
00:21:40,985 --> 00:21:41,406
Scott: who do?

375
00:21:41,447 --> 00:21:47,247
Scott: who still to this day do their writing, not with, you know, pen and paper.

376
00:21:47,267 --> 00:21:48,419
Scott: They're not going that old school.

377
00:21:48,881 --> 00:21:49,082
Scott: Right.

378
00:21:49,865 --> 00:21:54,746
Scott: Not with Microsoft Word, like some new one, but specifically word perfect for DOS.

379
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:55,600
Scott: Right.

380
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:09,560
Scott: Where are or some sort of older word processor from that exact that brief period of time when word processors were still complex, you know, complex and fully featured there, you know, beyond text editors.

381
00:22:10,202 --> 00:22:10,422
Scott: Right.

382
00:22:10,884 --> 00:22:17,608
Scott: But not ridiculously full of features, which I guess around happened, maybe like maybe Microsoft Word.

383
00:22:17,668 --> 00:22:24,280
Scott: ninety five, maybe was around the time where they really went like, you know, ridiculous with the word processor and cluttered it up with.

384
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:28,560
Rym: I remember working like writing documents in these early eras of word processing.

385
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:36,280
Rym: In fact, I remember writing an essay on an actual noncomputer, like a word processor where the screen was like four rows of base.

386
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,846
Scott: I tried to go look for like.

387
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:42,359
Scott: I tried to go look to see if anyone still made one of those or be if you could get old ones.

388
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,300
Rym: Someone I saw some people are making some modern ones, but they're running like Raspberry inside of or something.

389
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:53,480
Scott: Yeah, they're not actually, you know, anyway, the point is, is that, you know, do you?

390
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:56,620
Scott: actually it's a lot of hassle, right, to go do that.

391
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,020
Scott: We need an old DOS computer.

392
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:58,901
Scott: It's like.

393
00:22:59,563 --> 00:23:03,155
Scott: so here is a project actually that, you know, it's called.

394
00:23:03,175 --> 00:23:04,720
Scott: what's it called?

395
00:23:04,921 --> 00:23:07,480
Scott: Word perfect for DOS updated, updated.

396
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:07,881
Scott: Right.

397
00:23:08,745 --> 00:23:11,236
Scott: And it's a whole set of instructions whereby you can.

398
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:29,280
Scott: Get word perfect for DOS 5 1 6 6 1 or 6 2 to run on a modern computer, and they even have tools where you can like convert between Doc X format to word perfect format to get your files saved and loaded back and forth.

399
00:23:29,801 --> 00:23:33,900
Scott: You can print you can you can get the clipboard will work.

400
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,399
Scott: You can copy and paste into it.

401
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:35,762
Scott: Right.

402
00:23:35,782 --> 00:23:36,024
Scott: You can.

403
00:23:36,287 --> 00:23:37,500
Scott: they have all this stuff working.

404
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,443
Scott: It's pretty impressive.

405
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:42,300
Scott: I didn't feel like going through the hassle of doing it.

406
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:50,604
Scott: But it really appeals to me in a strong way, not because I want to use specifically old as word perfect for DOS,

407
00:23:51,105 --> 00:23:51,306
Rym: but

408
00:23:51,687 --> 00:24:09,459
Scott: the though that exact time period, the word processors that came out then right were had like this exact feature set of, you know, having enough features that word type, you know, typing is, you know, lovely and pleasant and you're not like missing anything.

409
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:13,380
Scott: But there isn't a whole bunch of stuff like getting in the way.

410
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:13,581
Scott: Right.

411
00:24:13,601 --> 00:24:13,802
Scott: It's like.

412
00:24:13,862 --> 00:24:20,940
Rym: I know personally, you know, I would argue those things don't get in the way of anyone with basic discipline, but maybe.

413
00:24:21,482 --> 00:24:21,985
Scott: But it's like.

414
00:24:22,066 --> 00:24:24,320
Scott: I just know that psychologically speaking, right.

415
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:30,619
Scott: If I go to type something like, you know, I'm writing like, you know, essay long, a long form text of some kind.

416
00:24:31,282 --> 00:24:34,060
Scott: If I do it in a text editor, that's no, you know, like Vim.

417
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,395
Scott: It's like that doesn't cut it.

418
00:24:35,497 --> 00:24:35,660
Scott: Right.

419
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:39,060
Scott: Vim doesn't, you know, format text and do it directly in LaTeX.

420
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:40,346
Scott: Yeah.

421
00:24:40,386 --> 00:24:41,660
Scott: You can't do headers or anything.

422
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,121
Scott: Yeah.

423
00:24:42,141 --> 00:24:50,880
Scott: You know, I could do it in LaTeX if it would, you know, but LaTeX only looks that way after you're done typing it, not while you're typing it.

424
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,161
Scott: Right.

425
00:24:51,522 --> 00:24:58,640
Scott: So, you know, you have to type some, you know, if you're using like Lex or something, you got to type in the weird language or whatever.

426
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,920
Scott: It's not that's not pleasant either.

427
00:25:00,441 --> 00:25:00,622
Scott: Right.

428
00:25:00,944 --> 00:25:03,540
Scott: But if you're going to use like the newest, newest Microsoft Word.

429
00:25:04,221 --> 00:25:04,482
Scott: Right.

430
00:25:05,264 --> 00:25:12,840
Scott: Or even Google Docs, you got to try to type a long thing in Google Docs and it's actually not, you know, it sort of gets in the way a little bit.

431
00:25:13,001 --> 00:25:13,282
Scott: Right.

432
00:25:13,342 --> 00:25:19,190
Scott: It's like, you know, you type in and you get this formatting and it's popping up with like spell checks and all, you know, it's like.

433
00:25:19,211 --> 00:25:21,603
Rym: what fucking word do you have set up?

434
00:25:21,643 --> 00:25:22,577
Rym: I don't have any of these problems.

435
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:36,820
Scott: Anyway, the point is, I'm just saying psychologically speaking, right, is, you know, there's less, you know, my mind is less focused on just the content of what I'm writing because it's being distracted in some way.

436
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:49,640
Rym: I know, I'm just giving you shit, partly because the person who made this website is definitely like you and like has particular, did you click on the link they have for, quote, the fact why some people use a DOS error word processor?

437
00:25:50,022 --> 00:25:50,770
Scott: No, I did not.

438
00:25:50,871 --> 00:25:51,600
Scott: I did not read that.

439
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,144
Scott: What does it say?

440
00:25:52,224 --> 00:25:54,460
Rym: Oh, if you click on that, it says everything is explained here.

441
00:25:54,741 --> 00:25:58,800
Rym: If you click on that, it takes you to the XKCD about how DOS is fine.

442
00:26:00,321 --> 00:26:00,762
Rym: And that's it.

443
00:26:01,785 --> 00:26:19,820
Rym: It's a very, but I guess what you're missing is that there are modern applications that are designed for things like I am writing a novel or an essay that are limited to the functions you would need that are useful for that specific purpose, like chapter outlines or plot outlines or citations.

444
00:26:21,022 --> 00:26:24,000
Rym: There are, but otherwise minimal and focused on the content.

445
00:26:24,801 --> 00:26:24,981
Scott: Sure.

446
00:26:25,182 --> 00:26:31,005
Scott: The other thing is that just the aesthetic of, oh, I would argue with you on the aesthetic.

447
00:26:31,491 --> 00:26:32,300
Rym: It's partly nostalgia.

448
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,200
Rym: Like we grew up through all these areas.

449
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:40,859
Rym: Like Scott, I literally grew up through like I wrote essays on a typewriter, mechanical, a mechanical one.

450
00:26:41,463 --> 00:26:43,980
Rym: We play you could plug it in because it would automatically do character turns.

451
00:26:44,242 --> 00:26:46,060
Rym: But otherwise, they're just a mechanical typewriter.

452
00:26:46,763 --> 00:26:49,219
Rym: And every era of word processors we've used.

453
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:50,382
Scott: Yep.

454
00:26:50,402 --> 00:26:55,583
Scott: So like I wouldn't personally use this project, mostly because it's too much of a hassle to.

455
00:26:55,723 --> 00:26:59,462
Rym: Also, did you read the fact at the bottom false positives from antivirus software?

456
00:26:59,803 --> 00:27:05,800
Rym: Do not email me if you get if this says if if your antivirus tells you this is malware, use other software.

457
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:06,800
Scott: Yep.

458
00:27:08,104 --> 00:27:15,507
Scott: But I would really love for somebody to to like write a piece of software that was basically a clone of word.

459
00:27:15,547 --> 00:27:18,700
Scott: perfect for DOS, except for Windows 10.

460
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,605
Rym: You know, it'd be fun.

461
00:27:19,646 --> 00:27:22,080
Rym: Make it as a game instead of word processor.

462
00:27:24,046 --> 00:27:25,119
Scott: What do you mean as a game?

463
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:32,160
Rym: You make the word to make you start an old word perfect and the game happens in there as you try to make a document.

464
00:27:33,622 --> 00:27:36,660
Scott: Oh, so it's like you pull a frog fraction.

465
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,759
Rym: Yeah, you pull a frog fractions, but it stays with that aesthetic to the end.

466
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:41,861
Scott: Yeah.

467
00:27:42,002 --> 00:27:44,679
Scott: So that, you know, if this interests you in any way.

468
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:45,322
Scott: Right.

469
00:27:45,483 --> 00:27:53,640
Scott: If you if you just imagine like, you know, if you're doing some writing and you think, man, it would be really nice to write it with, you know, a word processor a lot like an old word perfect.

470
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,526
Scott: Well, here's how you can.

471
00:27:54,687 --> 00:27:56,540
Scott: here's how you can do it on your modern computer.

472
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,325
Scott: That's neat.

473
00:27:57,809 --> 00:27:59,219
Rym: So I just did an anime thing.

474
00:27:59,942 --> 00:28:08,279
Rym: I don't know how many of you have actually ever watched the old Speed Racer, like the like Speed Racer, but a couple episodes a long time ago.

475
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:14,280
Rym: Speed is kind of a gigantic dick like he is mean.

476
00:28:14,683 --> 00:28:15,679
Rym: He is cruel.

477
00:28:16,342 --> 00:28:19,479
Rym: The show is if you've never seen it, it's probably not what you think it is.

478
00:28:19,841 --> 00:28:24,421
Rym: But one thing that really stands out in this video sort of encapsulates it is that speed kills.

479
00:28:24,481 --> 00:28:32,636
Rym: a lot of people like with guns, like speed will just bust out a gun and murder a whole bunch of people that happen.

480
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:33,945
Scott: They're bad guys.

481
00:28:34,006 --> 00:28:35,459
Scott: Yeah, there are bad guys.

482
00:28:35,843 --> 00:28:37,079
Rym: He's killing, quote, bad guys.

483
00:28:38,003 --> 00:28:40,220
Rym: There's other videos that highlight other horrible things.

484
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:40,902
Rym: Speed is done.

485
00:28:41,364 --> 00:28:46,539
Rym: But I think this video really encapsulates like the mood of what Speed Racer is really like to watch it.

486
00:28:46,901 --> 00:28:54,016
Rym: But it's a compilation just of him using guns, except one point where he murders someone with his car instead of with the gun.

487
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,680
Scott: And it's I mean, you know, Wacky Races is pretty similar, right?

488
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:02,218
Scott: In Wacky Races, you've got, you know, the bad guys, right?

489
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,119
Scott: And they're intentionally running people off the road.

490
00:29:05,562 --> 00:29:09,859
Scott: But then it's like Yogi Bear, but he runs people off the road, too.

491
00:29:11,582 --> 00:29:16,339
Rym: I would like I would watch a like modern reboot Rocky Wacky Races type thing.

492
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,268
Rym: Bonus points if you want to watch that.

493
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:29,060
Rym: Yeah, but anyway, Metamoment, the biggest news we got because we don't have cons, there's no new panels to upload or anything, but we are or we did.

494
00:29:29,522 --> 00:29:33,240
Rym: We published and officially activated the new GeekNights Community Code of Conduct.

495
00:29:33,642 --> 00:29:39,959
Rym: I recommend you read it because if you're listening to this and you're interacting with us in any way, this code of conduct applies to you.

496
00:29:40,723 --> 00:29:43,260
Rym: It will not be a problem for you unless you're a bad person.

497
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:52,440
Scott: If there is a digital or physical space in which we are organizing the community and so social activity, then this rule applies.

498
00:29:52,761 --> 00:29:58,823
Scott: And if you do not abide by the rule, you will be evicted from the space to the best of our ability.

499
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:00,999
Scott: So you should read it.

500
00:30:01,701 --> 00:30:01,882
Rym: Yep.

501
00:30:02,203 --> 00:30:07,600
Rym: If you think you are not a bad person, but you think that we should make some changes to this, it's in GitHub.

502
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,760
Rym: I know this is the Wednesday GeekNights, but trust me, GitHub is not that hard to use.

503
00:30:13,101 --> 00:30:17,119
Rym: But you can submit changes to our code of conduct and we will review them.

504
00:30:18,081 --> 00:30:24,179
Scott: And you could just also just contact us using any means of communication whatsoever to tell us what you think about it.

505
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:28,140
Scott: Positive, negative, change this, change that, you know, comment, whatever.

506
00:30:28,604 --> 00:30:29,760
Scott: It's always subject to change.

507
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,610
Scott: It's not perfect.

508
00:30:30,691 --> 00:30:31,219
Scott: So, yep.

509
00:30:31,442 --> 00:30:33,279
Rym: And we'll continue to evolve it as time goes on.

510
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,080
Rym: But speaking of community, remember, we have a forum.

511
00:30:36,581 --> 00:30:44,600
Rym: We have a legacy forum, like 12 years of like old posts from the old forum, which was really, really high volume compared to the new forum.

512
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,240
Rym: Partly because forums aren't as common anymore.

513
00:30:46,362 --> 00:30:47,658
Rym: Like they're not as used as they used to be.

514
00:30:47,981 --> 00:30:48,908
Rym: We got a Discord.

515
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:50,420
Rym: We got this YouTube stream right here.

516
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,519
Rym: There's a million, million places.

517
00:30:52,101 --> 00:30:54,179
Rym: Actually, there's like seven places you can interact with us.

518
00:30:54,542 --> 00:30:55,699
Rym: But we're in all those places.

519
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:56,783
Rym: Just find us.

520
00:30:56,864 --> 00:30:59,980
Rym: Type GeekNights into whatever text box is in front of you.

521
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:04,480
Rym: And unless it's WordPerfect on MS-DOS, it'll probably take you to one of those places.

522
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:08,000
Scott: Yeah, we're on the Twitter, Facebook, freaking Spotify.

523
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,440
Rym: Don't contact us on Facebook, please.

524
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,420
Scott: No, but there is a page there.

525
00:31:12,782 --> 00:31:13,899
Rym: It is technically still there.

526
00:31:14,641 --> 00:31:19,160
Scott: Yeah, I posted on it once and was like, hey, does anyone see this?

527
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,233
Scott: And people saw it.

528
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,118
Scott: Yeah, I guess so.

529
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:31,558
Rym: And otherwise, the the GeekNights Book Club books, even the tale of Genji, I think I might just start reading it again every time I poop.

530
00:31:32,561 --> 00:31:39,704
Rym: Oh, so watch out if I if I continue this trend for the rest of the week, then you're on notice.

531
00:31:39,887 --> 00:31:40,860
Scott: I'll tell you.

532
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:41,506
Scott: I'll tell you what.

533
00:31:41,607 --> 00:31:42,779
Scott: As soon as you read.

534
00:31:44,241 --> 00:31:56,660
Scott: The first person, right, if you read a page of the tale of Genji that you have not read before or I read a page of it that I have not read before, immediately message the other person and say, I'm reading it right this second.

535
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:03,592
Scott: And that way, you know, whoever writes it, as soon as you receive the message, well, now you don't need to send because that's where we will know what I read.

536
00:32:06,161 --> 00:32:10,699
Rym: What I read was I skimmed through what I had read already to remind myself where I was.

537
00:32:11,502 --> 00:32:11,722
Scott: Yeah.

538
00:32:12,144 --> 00:32:17,960
Scott: So, you know, we will that we will know exactly who started reading again first.

539
00:32:18,181 --> 00:32:21,680
Scott: And the other person will then have the hot, you know, the fire on the ass.

540
00:32:22,521 --> 00:32:22,782
Rym: Yeah.

541
00:32:23,204 --> 00:32:26,520
Rym: But you're on notice, the fire's not like, yeah, I've only done this twice.

542
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,800
Rym: That's two poops worth of reading.

543
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:37,860
Scott: The point is, if one of us finishes it and the other person is not yet finished or not even started continuing reading it, oh, then every time we get to them at a moment.

544
00:32:38,161 --> 00:32:38,362
Scott: Right.

545
00:32:38,403 --> 00:32:46,800
Scott: For example, if I finish it and you haven't and you haven't even started, I'm going to be like, I've finished the tale of Genji, but still hasn't read any since.

546
00:32:47,444 --> 00:32:48,518
Scott: And that's going to be bad.

547
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,099
Rym: So shame is a powerful motivator.

548
00:32:51,541 --> 00:32:51,984
Scott: That's right.

549
00:32:52,004 --> 00:32:54,620
Scott: So as soon as one of us starts, the other person has to also.

550
00:32:56,622 --> 00:32:59,260
Rym: So, yeah, otherwise, let's go right into it.

551
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:05,656
Rym: Decadence will avoid for the beginning, at least spoiling anything about the show, but will spoil a little bit.

552
00:33:06,265 --> 00:33:07,300
Scott: So that's very difficult.

553
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,087
Scott: But here, so we judge.

554
00:33:09,308 --> 00:33:12,480
Scott: we judge this show for the Crunchyroll Expo.

555
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,120
Rym: Yeah, I don't know if that made the cut.

556
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:18,140
Rym: I think I might have edited out for time, like our review of the show at the time.

557
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:26,266
Scott: We said this looks like a proper noun laden, sort of, you know, tropey, very anime kind of anime.

558
00:33:26,306 --> 00:33:27,660
Scott: That's I think that's what we said.

559
00:33:27,741 --> 00:33:28,900
Scott: I don't remember clearly.

560
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:36,140
Rym: But I remember the result was, regardless of those details, that this show is probably fine, but probably not great.

561
00:33:36,882 --> 00:33:40,240
Rym: This is a show that I will not watch unless there is buzz about it.

562
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:44,658
Rym: If other people are talking about it, then I will watch it to see what the drill is.

563
00:33:46,349 --> 00:33:46,451
Rym: Yep.

564
00:33:46,471 --> 00:33:46,875
Rym: And that buzz.

565
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:51,597
Rym: Behold, there was buzz, buzz, like bit by bit, like one of our like.

566
00:33:51,637 --> 00:33:56,939
Rym: someone on Twitter was like tweeted something that I follow, I follow them and they were like something something decadence.

567
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:57,867
Rym: Holy shit.

568
00:33:57,928 --> 00:33:59,119
Rym: I was like, oh, all right.

569
00:33:59,661 --> 00:34:00,698
Rym: Wasn't that the show we judge?

570
00:34:01,082 --> 00:34:09,541
Rym: And then our friends use the Natalie over the other guy we're hanging out a few weeks ago and they were like, oh, if you watch Decadence yet, oh, I'm not even I won't say anything.

571
00:34:10,043 --> 00:34:14,739
Rym: They refused to say anything about the show until I had seen two episodes.

572
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:20,080
Scott: OK, so Decadence is an anime and it's only 12 episodes long.

573
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,119
Scott: That's the whole damn show.

574
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,257
Rym: Yeah, I'm going to finish it.

575
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:34,040
Scott: So you can think of it as a four hour movie, which is actually not significantly longer than like, I don't know, Lawrence of Arabia.

576
00:34:34,681 --> 00:34:36,300
Scott: It's like it's basically the same.

577
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:43,620
Scott: So you can just think of it as, you know, one thing that you're going to watch all at once or break it up into two parts, whatever.

578
00:34:43,802 --> 00:34:45,257
Scott: It's really not long at all.

579
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,780
Rym: Yeah, I've only watched four episodes.

580
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:48,918
Rym: Scott's watched the whole thing.

581
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:58,100
Rym: But what I'll say is that I see why people were acting the way they were about this show, why everyone who mentioned it to me always said the same thing.

582
00:34:58,302 --> 00:34:59,779
Rym: Oh, watch a bunch of it.

583
00:35:00,302 --> 00:35:01,720
Rym: Then let's talk about it.

584
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,759
Rym: The show is not about what you think it's about.

585
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:07,040
Scott: Yeah, so it is a 12 episode show.

586
00:35:07,121 --> 00:35:09,840
Scott: It does not appear to have been based on a manga of any kind.

587
00:35:10,362 --> 00:35:14,079
Scott: It was directed by someone, Yuzuru Tachikawa, who I've never heard of.

588
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,000
Scott: They might have done something else.

589
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:16,462
Scott: I don't know.

590
00:35:17,508 --> 00:35:19,600
Scott: It was done by Studio Nut.

591
00:35:19,861 --> 00:35:20,899
Scott: I don't know what else they did.

592
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,740
Scott: And then it's a Funimation thing.

593
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:23,503
Rym: Holy shit.

594
00:35:23,524 --> 00:35:25,039
Rym: They did storyboards on Arslan.

595
00:35:28,702 --> 00:35:38,498
Scott: OK, the legal way to watch it in the United States would be on Funimation or Hulu and the illegal way would be to pirate it.

596
00:35:39,502 --> 00:35:41,340
Scott: And those are the only ways you're going to see in the U.S.

597
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:41,702
Scott: right now.

598
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:44,380
Scott: I don't think it's on a DVD of any kind or a Booray.

599
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,244
Rym: Yeah, I don't think so either.

600
00:35:45,264 --> 00:35:47,699
Rym: It wasn't on any platform that I had like easily set up.

601
00:35:48,423 --> 00:35:50,040
Scott: So, yeah, I also don't know if it's dubbed.

602
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,055
Scott: I watched it subbed.

603
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,880
Rym: Yeah, I don't really watch dubbed anime.

604
00:35:53,522 --> 00:35:54,249
Rym: No, you can't.

605
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:54,775
Rym: I just don't.

606
00:35:56,001 --> 00:36:03,680
Scott: OK, so it's really hard to talk about the show without spoiling, because this show is heavily laden with anime tropes.

607
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:08,441
Scott: I'm going to list so many tropes that get to the point where I list all the tropes it has.

608
00:36:08,521 --> 00:36:21,660
Scott: But one of the tropes it, of course, has is our favorite terrible secret of space where, you know, there is like all these questions constantly there in your face while these other things are happening and they're answering other questions.

609
00:36:21,741 --> 00:36:24,520
Scott: But there's these big questions like what's really going on in the world?

610
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,960
Scott: How does this world darker than black?

611
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,258
Rym: What's outside that wall?

612
00:36:28,662 --> 00:36:29,978
Rym: What's the key of the twilight?

613
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,041
Scott: Right.

614
00:36:31,061 --> 00:36:34,849
Scott: The characters are in the dark about the what the truth of the world that they live in.

615
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:35,359
Scott: Right.

616
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:39,180
Scott: They don't understand the reality that they are under and neither do you.

617
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,579
Scott: But it will be revealed to you before it is to them.

618
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:41,881
Scott: Right.

619
00:36:41,901 --> 00:36:50,901
Rym: Now, some shows the end of the show or at least the end of a season or like the middle episode of the show will be like, here is the answer to the terrible secret of space.

620
00:36:51,605 --> 00:36:54,680
Rym: And if it's the end of the show, that's the plot or it happens in the middle.

621
00:36:55,022 --> 00:36:57,799
Rym: And that sets the stage for the final arc of the show.

622
00:36:58,421 --> 00:37:06,400
Rym: This show kind of reveals the secret, like so by the end of the first episode, you rims only seen four episodes, right?

623
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:14,300
Scott: So they reveal quite a large secret of space in episode like two, one that would have been sufficient.

624
00:37:15,181 --> 00:37:15,904
Scott: That would be right.

625
00:37:16,084 --> 00:37:19,195
Scott: One that would have been a normal anime show.

626
00:37:19,336 --> 00:37:22,438
Scott: ending reveal of that's how the world really works.

627
00:37:23,405 --> 00:37:23,587
Scott: Right.

628
00:37:23,607 --> 00:37:24,659
Scott: And there's only 12 episodes.

629
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:25,460
Rym: Right.

630
00:37:25,922 --> 00:37:32,672
Scott: So they reveal like a bombshell in episode two and then they continue to bombshell.

631
00:37:32,692 --> 00:37:33,260
Rym: Right.

632
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:39,285
Rym: By episode four, I had been hit with a second bombshell and Scott's already telling me before the show.

633
00:37:39,305 --> 00:37:41,100
Rym: Oh, you haven't even read anything yet.

634
00:37:41,341 --> 00:37:41,521
Scott: Right.

635
00:37:41,742 --> 00:37:48,082
Scott: So, for example, in episode nine, I'm going to you know, in episode nine, they do a thing.

636
00:37:48,223 --> 00:37:51,897
Scott: There is a climactic event, right, that occurs in episode nine.

637
00:37:52,318 --> 00:37:56,760
Scott: that would normally be in another anime, the end of the show.

638
00:37:56,982 --> 00:37:58,140
Scott: It is so climactic.

639
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,720
Scott: That's like, oh, well, Dave, Dave, that's got to be the end of the show, right?

640
00:38:02,021 --> 00:38:03,620
Scott: There is three more episodes left.

641
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:05,959
Scott: That is a 12 episode show.

642
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:06,541
Scott: Guess what?

643
00:38:06,882 --> 00:38:17,360
Scott: Twenty five percent of the show remains after a climactic event that would end any other normal and like Evangelion, like the third impact.

644
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:18,203
Rym: Happens.

645
00:38:18,585 --> 00:38:20,560
Rym: And then there's still five more episodes.

646
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:21,140
Scott: Right.

647
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:28,871
Scott: So the only way in a show such as this where literally you're getting, you know, anything you discuss whatsoever is going to spoil.

648
00:38:29,796 --> 00:38:30,580
Scott: not, you know, tons.

649
00:38:30,702 --> 00:38:31,720
Scott: I don't care about spoilers.

650
00:38:32,002 --> 00:38:32,163
Scott: Right.

651
00:38:32,223 --> 00:38:35,822
Scott: Personally, but not going to spoil it for you because you're going to go watch this, I guess.

652
00:38:36,002 --> 00:38:45,339
Scott: Yeah, I would only discuss the show in a non spoiler way if I only speak in generalities and nonspecifics.

653
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,846
Rym: Yeah, I guess we could.

654
00:38:46,886 --> 00:38:49,920
Rym: at the very end, we'll see how we want to approach it.

655
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,090
Scott: The problem is, is I can't, you know, I have to.

656
00:38:52,331 --> 00:38:54,688
Scott: if we go to spoiler territory, I got to let you take the lead.

657
00:38:54,809 --> 00:38:55,840
Rym: Well, I guess I'll put it this way.

658
00:38:56,341 --> 00:38:59,560
Rym: So when I start watching the show, it looks like a pretty standard anime.

659
00:39:00,021 --> 00:39:09,740
Rym: I was getting some Fullmetal Alchemist vibes in terms of like the rough like level of quality, like what the characters are like, like it just felt like that kind of show.

660
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:16,680
Rym: And I was getting into it like if there had been no terrible secret or space at all, I think I would have been interested in the show anyway.

661
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,979
Rym: I might have actually kept watching.

662
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:31,343
Rym: So then at the end of the first episode, it like cuts to a scene that is really weird looking, like a very different style, and it doesn't explain anything in the episode ends.

663
00:39:31,363 --> 00:39:32,520
Rym: And you're like, wait, wait, what?

664
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,342
Rym: What was that?

665
00:39:34,265 --> 00:39:43,460
Rym: And then episode two backs up and explains what the deal is with that, which is already a bigger, terrible secret space than most anime will ever have.

666
00:39:44,308 --> 00:39:45,260
Scott: Yes, exactly.

667
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:49,200
Rym: And then it just keeps going from there.

668
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:59,260
Rym: And what I like is that the characters cross all these like these like weird demarcations of what the show looks like and is about.

669
00:39:59,903 --> 00:40:02,640
Rym: And the characters are themselves pretty compelling and interesting.

670
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:09,300
Scott: Yeah, I'm trying to think of how we can explain the two styles and how significant they are to the show without spoiling it.

671
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:09,500
Scott: Right.

672
00:40:09,521 --> 00:40:13,420
Scott: So imagine you had an anime that took place on two planets.

673
00:40:13,522 --> 00:40:14,619
Scott: It's not this, not this one.

674
00:40:15,321 --> 00:40:16,204
Scott: Right.

675
00:40:16,224 --> 00:40:21,240
Scott: And one planet was drawn in an art deco style by one set of artists.

676
00:40:21,581 --> 00:40:25,400
Scott: And the other the other planet was drawn in an art nouveau style.

677
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:25,842
Scott: Right.

678
00:40:25,862 --> 00:40:26,979
Scott: A completely different art style.

679
00:40:27,684 --> 00:40:27,806
Scott: Right.

680
00:40:27,826 --> 00:40:28,540
Scott: Doesn't even match.

681
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:34,579
Scott: You think they're two different shows, but they're actually just two different places in the same show.

682
00:40:35,121 --> 00:40:35,362
Scott: Right.

683
00:40:35,423 --> 00:40:39,119
Scott: Two different sets of characters who live in the different places because they're two different alien races.

684
00:40:39,682 --> 00:40:39,863
Scott: Right.

685
00:40:40,125 --> 00:40:42,220
Scott: And they're just drawn completely differently.

686
00:40:42,421 --> 00:40:42,622
Scott: Right.

687
00:40:42,642 --> 00:40:51,636
Scott: Like you hired, you know, you know, you know what, you hired Studio Ghibli to draw the first planet and you hired, you know, to draw the second.

688
00:40:53,725 --> 00:40:53,947
Rym: Keklos.

689
00:40:53,967 --> 00:40:54,979
Scott: Keklos does that.

690
00:40:56,962 --> 00:40:57,625
Scott: Yeah, you're right.

691
00:40:57,665 --> 00:41:06,060
Rym: The different the Spartans are drawn differently than the, you know, you've got the stop motion and Greek statues and then you've got the Yamashibai.

692
00:41:06,221 --> 00:41:08,620
Rym: look in 2D like limited animation characters.

693
00:41:09,221 --> 00:41:09,685
Scott: Exactly.

694
00:41:09,726 --> 00:41:11,440
Scott: So that's what's going on in this show.

695
00:41:11,661 --> 00:41:15,180
Scott: Is that there are two sets of characters kind of.

696
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:15,581
Scott: Right.

697
00:41:15,601 --> 00:41:18,480
Scott: And they're drawn in completely different art styles.

698
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:26,180
Scott: The main characters that you're going to start to see at the start of episode one are drawn in a sort of generic anime kind of way for 2020.

699
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:26,262
Scott: Yep.

700
00:41:26,324 --> 00:41:26,920
Rym: They look good though.

701
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,020
Rym: Like they're good character designs.

702
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:28,921
Scott: Right.

703
00:41:28,941 --> 00:41:33,080
Scott: And these other characters are drawn like cute little cartoon characters.

704
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,360
Scott: They look like they're from like a kids show or something.

705
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:37,505
Scott: You know, they're very like.

706
00:41:37,525 --> 00:41:40,623
Scott: they're toys that you would buy at like the kid robot store or something.

707
00:41:41,426 --> 00:41:41,908
Scott: But they are.

708
00:41:42,029 --> 00:41:45,728
Scott: it's almost like a Roger Rabbit only instead of live action plus cartoon.

709
00:41:45,788 --> 00:41:47,399
Scott: It's cartoon plus different cartoon.

710
00:41:48,302 --> 00:41:50,820
Scott: And they're, you know, together in the same story.

711
00:41:51,440 --> 00:42:06,458
Scott: And it's kind of I think for a person who's not an animation person that just the visual contrast there, I don't think I think a non anime person that have a hard time just seeing past that.

712
00:42:06,802 --> 00:42:07,449
Rym: Yeah, I could.

713
00:42:07,509 --> 00:42:08,580
Rym: I could definitely see that.

714
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:16,260
Scott: I could see someone taking the shows and taking the show seriously, because like the story of the show, it's not a silly story.

715
00:42:16,401 --> 00:42:18,078
Scott: It's a serious sci fi action.

716
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:19,021
Rym: Yeah.

717
00:42:19,041 --> 00:42:25,780
Rym: Like the like the opening scene like that set before you actually start watching the show almost feels like a scene out of like Jurassic Park.

718
00:42:26,842 --> 00:42:27,446
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

719
00:42:27,466 --> 00:42:29,840
Rym: In terms of what goes down and why.

720
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:43,139
Scott: And then especially the kid robot style characters, if they are doing something very serious, but just the way they look, it's not like Oh, kaburagi that voice, the main dude's voice is a very good voice.

721
00:42:43,842 --> 00:42:44,606
Scott: Yeah, it's not.

722
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:47,000
Scott: You'll notice there's a lot of voice actors in this.

723
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:57,506
Scott: You've heard before there's them, you know, in every studio trigger anime, there's usually like a really loud, like squeaky, small, usually female, you know, female character.

724
00:42:57,527 --> 00:42:58,013
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

725
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:07,920
Scott: It was like, you know, that character is that voice actor is also voicing a similar character in this show, even though it is not a studio trigger joint.

726
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:22,379
Scott: So, yeah, but yeah, seeing the characters with the not serious cartoony art style engaging in serious drama, I think will be a miss for a lot of people who are not anime animation people.

727
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:23,682
Rym: Yeah.

728
00:43:23,843 --> 00:43:29,447
Rym: Also, because the character interactions like it actually has a surprisingly low anime attacks.

729
00:43:29,728 --> 00:43:35,160
Rym: otherwise, like the characters are normal, like the characters interact in interesting ways.

730
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:36,520
Rym: The voice acting is really good.

731
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,899
Rym: There aren't like weird fan service bits.

732
00:43:40,101 --> 00:43:41,206
Scott: Yeah, that's literally the.

733
00:43:41,286 --> 00:43:43,839
Scott: I think the only thing that's an anime text is that.

734
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:51,097
Scott: OK, so the other thing about this show is that it is like I said before, it is laden with anime tropes.

735
00:43:51,178 --> 00:43:51,280
Scott: Right.

736
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:59,500
Scott: So the first trope you see immediately is, of course, the trope of, you know, there are secrets in this world, precursors, you know, whatever.

737
00:43:59,640 --> 00:43:59,923
Scott: Right.

738
00:44:00,085 --> 00:44:01,520
Scott: Obviously, it's terrible secret to space.

739
00:44:02,642 --> 00:44:05,380
Scott: There is this thing that has become popular.

740
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:11,580
Scott: I think Attack on Titan made it popular where you fight using some sort of backpack that has like a weapon attached to it.

741
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:12,343
Scott: There's been at least.

742
00:44:12,624 --> 00:44:19,260
Rym: Yeah, there is a big Attack on Titan vibe when they're actually fighting with the big monsters outside of the city.

743
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:32,875
Rym: It's got the trope of we're in a we're in a ship or of some kind and it's us against the world with like a man center in the ship and like deploy like almost like a gundam kind of gundam.

744
00:44:34,484 --> 00:44:38,319
Scott: Well, it's more like Macross, right, where the people live inside the giant robot.

745
00:44:38,339 --> 00:44:39,202
Scott: that is enormous.

746
00:44:40,325 --> 00:44:48,130
Scott: But the giant robot also transforms and fights and it has, you know, a bridge and it's it now has.

747
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:51,370
Rym: we have to change things because the the most powerful punch is one punch, man.

748
00:44:51,391 --> 00:44:51,939
Rym: That doesn't count.

749
00:44:52,363 --> 00:44:54,219
Rym: The most powerful punch, that's not one punch, man.

750
00:44:54,380 --> 00:45:00,721
Scott: Up until this point had been the big oh, big oh, or I guess Mazinger also is a rocket punch.

751
00:45:00,761 --> 00:45:01,142
Scott: Yeah.

752
00:45:01,162 --> 00:45:04,531
Scott: So I think, but the this is the.

753
00:45:05,173 --> 00:45:10,220
Rym: this is the big oh, I imagine if the Macross ship did the big oh punch is what happens.

754
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:10,923
Rym: It does.

755
00:45:11,728 --> 00:45:13,539
Rym: I imagine that because that's literally what happens.

756
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:21,060
Scott: The Macross ship has the the Daedalus attack because its right arm is actually just like is it a battleship or an aircraft carrier?

757
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,100
Scott: And it's called the Daedalus, right?

758
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:24,480
Scott: They attached it to the Macross.

759
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,959
Scott: It's not an alien ship like the Macross is.

760
00:45:27,341 --> 00:45:37,780
Scott: And then it punches the alien ship right in the front and then they open the bay in the front of it and all the robots are just like launch all their missiles after they punch inside the hull of the enemy.

761
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,279
Scott: Anyway, Macross spoilers.

762
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:52,259
Rym: Yeah, there's a. there's a big fight where you start out like a gundam or Macross fight where there's like, you know, that trope where there's people in like a command center shouting orders like open the thing, do the thing, communicating with each other.

763
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:53,120
Scott: Right.

764
00:45:53,160 --> 00:46:00,180
Scott: This show, OK, this show also has the trope of a Godzilla movie.

765
00:46:00,461 --> 00:46:00,722
Scott: Right.

766
00:46:00,762 --> 00:46:06,778
Scott: There's basically there's an episode where they're fighting a very large monster like Godzilla sized.

767
00:46:07,622 --> 00:46:17,959
Scott: And you know how in a Godzilla movie, there's always that part where Godzilla is sleeping and you're waiting and then and then they're preparing and doing all this stuff and then wait for it to wake up again.

768
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:18,341
Scott: Right.

769
00:46:18,743 --> 00:46:21,700
Scott: It is like there's an episode that's basically a Godzilla movie.

770
00:46:22,061 --> 00:46:22,634
Scott: The episode.

771
00:46:22,675 --> 00:46:22,818
Scott: Yeah.

772
00:46:24,102 --> 00:46:27,500
Scott: But yeah, it's like I could probably keep going on with this more and more.

773
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:34,699
Scott: It's like you're going to see in this show basically so many other anime just like incorporated together.

774
00:46:35,241 --> 00:46:35,542
Scott: Right.

775
00:46:36,265 --> 00:46:40,100
Scott: You know, like these key pieces of just well trodden territory.

776
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:53,074
Scott: But then what they do to just, you know, to make this not just another anime is each and every one of those normal old anime things are a obviously combined into one show, which is interesting.

777
00:46:53,217 --> 00:46:53,400
Scott: Right.

778
00:46:53,761 --> 00:47:10,882
Scott: But B, like we said, with the constant, you know, pushing to the next terrible secret of space after the previous one and, you know, going further is they push each and every one of those troops like farther than you could have imagined it being possible to push them.

779
00:47:10,942 --> 00:47:11,123
Scott: Right.

780
00:47:11,143 --> 00:47:13,397
Scott: So it's like if I took a lemon and it's like everyone knows.

781
00:47:13,437 --> 00:47:14,261
Scott: a lemon tastes like.

782
00:47:14,321 --> 00:47:14,542
Scott: Right.

783
00:47:14,944 --> 00:47:19,627
Scott: And I squeeze it all out and you look at that lemon and you say that lemon is bone dry.

784
00:47:19,708 --> 00:47:21,060
Scott: That's the Godzilla movie lemon.

785
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:23,480
Scott: We've seen everything we could see from a Godzilla movie.

786
00:47:23,621 --> 00:47:25,100
Scott: There is nothing left to get from there.

787
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:26,031
Scott: And we know what it tastes like.

788
00:47:26,071 --> 00:47:26,840
Scott: It tastes like lemon.

789
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:27,621
Scott: Right.

790
00:47:27,641 --> 00:47:34,060
Scott: Decadence comes over and grabs this dry ass lemon rind and squeezes it.

791
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:34,361
Scott: Right.

792
00:47:34,904 --> 00:47:38,560
Scott: And what comes out is still just more lemon juice.

793
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:39,815
Scott: It doesn't taste any different.

794
00:47:39,876 --> 00:47:40,079
Scott: Right.

795
00:47:40,561 --> 00:47:44,720
Scott: But like a whole extra glass of lemon juice comes out and you're like, what the fuck?

796
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:45,688
Scott: How did you get?

797
00:47:45,871 --> 00:47:46,255
Scott: Right.

798
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,480
Scott: It's like that guy slapping the hood of the car.

799
00:47:48,641 --> 00:47:50,700
Scott: I can fit X whatever here.

800
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:51,041
Scott: Right.

801
00:47:51,121 --> 00:47:54,520
Scott: It's like somehow they've taken this old hat trope.

802
00:47:54,841 --> 00:47:55,422
Scott: Right.

803
00:47:55,583 --> 00:48:03,559
Scott: Of normal old anime stuff, stuff you've seen before, stuff you know so well and they haven't changed the way it tastes.

804
00:48:03,762 --> 00:48:04,939
Scott: It's the same old anime.

805
00:48:05,541 --> 00:48:06,978
Scott: They just got more out of it.

806
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:08,939
Scott: And it's like, oh, wow.

807
00:48:09,101 --> 00:48:09,565
Scott: Look at that.

808
00:48:09,586 --> 00:48:10,292
Scott: How did you do that?

809
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:12,766
Rym: In fact, you know, another thing it does.

810
00:48:12,786 --> 00:48:21,365
Rym: that I appreciate, because Big O did this sort of retroactively, all the little detail, like background details, like really minor stuff.

811
00:48:21,608 --> 00:48:22,398
Rym: Utena did this too.

812
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:31,716
Rym: Anime looking things that you might just ignore in a show like, oh, they just drew that thing that way because it's anime that seems to always end up mattering.

813
00:48:32,438 --> 00:48:33,000
Rym: specifically.

814
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:41,000
Rym: Like there's a scene in the very beginning where the girl is like, I want to I want to be a fighter out fighting the Godalls like those people over there.

815
00:48:41,442 --> 00:48:45,483
Rym: And you see those people and they have like radically different colored skin for everyone else.

816
00:48:45,543 --> 00:48:48,580
Rym: And they're like like neon hair and they just kind of look crazy.

817
00:48:49,221 --> 00:48:54,880
Rym: And the explanation you're given is that, oh, they're part of this warrior case, like they're a different type of person.

818
00:48:55,382 --> 00:48:57,720
Rym: And it is true that they're a different type of person.

819
00:48:57,882 --> 00:48:58,900
Rym: But that is a spoiler.

820
00:48:59,302 --> 00:49:03,600
Rym: But that detail is just like two seconds of screen time.

821
00:49:04,281 --> 00:49:19,123
Scott: Well, at least at that point in the show, I can definitely tell you that is as someone who's seen the whole show, I can tell you there is I mean, other than, you know, your suspension of disbelief because you're watching a fictional anime and a fantasy sci-fi world.

822
00:49:19,204 --> 00:49:27,540
Scott: Other than that, it is extremely tight on terms of plot holes and every single thing you see matters and make sense.

823
00:49:27,843 --> 00:49:29,460
Rym: I really appreciate that in a show.

824
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:30,364
Scott: And there are.

825
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:32,980
Scott: no there's not a lot of loose thread hanging at the end.

826
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:41,800
Rym: I was not left at the end with any questions of like, hey, what about the something something like at the end of Fullmetal Alchemist, the original show, we were like, all right, so now what the fuck?

827
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:43,440
Rym: You didn't answer like any of my questions.

828
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:44,245
Scott: Exactly.

829
00:49:44,285 --> 00:49:45,500
Scott: That will not happen with this show.

830
00:49:46,581 --> 00:49:50,420
Scott: The the negative thing I can say about this show is that being 12 episodes, it's good.

831
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:51,712
Scott: It moves right along.

832
00:49:51,772 --> 00:49:52,440
Scott: It moves maybe.

833
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:53,386
Scott: Right.

834
00:49:53,648 --> 00:49:55,180
Scott: It doesn't feel like it's going too fast.

835
00:49:55,361 --> 00:49:59,720
Scott: It's just like steadily hitting really hard constantly.

836
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:11,680
Scott: But the characters, other than the two most main characters, all of the other characters are not given a lot of time and or development.

837
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,160
Scott: Ones that get time early, get almost no time late.

838
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:18,580
Scott: Ones that get time late are not given time early.

839
00:50:19,382 --> 00:50:31,820
Scott: So it kind of changes over the show, which characters are getting more time and all the characters, other than the main ones, basically have like one thread that's theirs is very shallow and is, you know, resolved.

840
00:50:33,102 --> 00:50:39,780
Scott: But it's like, you know, I guess in episode one, it's like the main character, the girl has like a friend in school or like it's orphanage school.

841
00:50:39,901 --> 00:50:40,082
Scott: Right.

842
00:50:40,685 --> 00:50:43,480
Scott: And so that's a side character, that school friend from episode one.

843
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:43,861
Scott: Yeah.

844
00:50:43,901 --> 00:50:44,062
Rym: Yeah.

845
00:50:44,162 --> 00:50:50,880
Scott: That school friend from episode one, you see briefly a few times when they interact a few seconds here and there.

846
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:56,180
Scott: And then the plot with that character is wrapped up in a couple scenes of drama.

847
00:50:56,523 --> 00:50:58,259
Scott: And then that's pretty much it.

848
00:50:58,741 --> 00:51:04,000
Scott: It's and you get pretty much that amount of stuff from each character.

849
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:12,819
Rym: Which is a shame because, you know, going back to the sort of Full Metal Alchemist energy, what I like about that show was that the side characters were all great and got a lot of screen time.

850
00:51:13,402 --> 00:51:17,483
Scott: And you start to like, well, I had more episodes and more manga pages to work with right here.

851
00:51:17,986 --> 00:51:20,380
Scott: Each each side character is very one note.

852
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:24,140
Scott: Like, here's their deal, their deal, you know, the first one.

853
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:24,524
Rym: Yeah, they.

854
00:51:25,071 --> 00:51:25,660
Scott: Right, exactly.

855
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:26,482
Scott: Here's their deal.

856
00:51:26,764 --> 00:51:31,643
Scott: They get a scene maybe right where you you write to maybe show you who they are.

857
00:51:31,663 --> 00:51:34,680
Scott: And then at some point their deal gets sort of resolved.

858
00:51:34,981 --> 00:51:40,616
Scott: And any other time you see them, if they do get more screen time, they're just sort of being who they are.

859
00:51:40,738 --> 00:51:40,920
Scott: Right.

860
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:42,960
Scott: So like loud guy who likes to fight.

861
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:45,239
Scott: It's like, yeah, he's got a scene that wraps up his shit.

862
00:51:45,521 --> 00:51:49,060
Scott: He's got an introduction scene and every other scene he's in, which is quite a few.

863
00:51:49,422 --> 00:51:51,419
Scott: He's just being a loud guy who likes to fight.

864
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:57,560
Scott: You know, he is not developing or have any, you know, interesting things going on.

865
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,740
Scott: And there's several characters other than the two main ones.

866
00:52:01,142 --> 00:52:03,800
Scott: But all of the other ones just sort of follow that thing.

867
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:05,687
Scott: This is a show that is not about.

868
00:52:06,530 --> 00:52:10,479
Scott: at least it's about the two main characters and it's about the plot of the world.

869
00:52:11,123 --> 00:52:12,620
Scott: It's not about the other characters.

870
00:52:12,721 --> 00:52:15,640
Scott: They're just sort of filling in, you know, where characters are needed.

871
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:19,680
Rym: Yeah, which is fine, because what I've seen so far, the world is plenty of meat.

872
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:22,840
Rym: It's like a Thanksgiving buffet where I can't eat everything.

873
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:25,600
Rym: It would be too much if it had everything, unless it was just longer.

874
00:52:26,941 --> 00:52:30,380
Rym: But then it might not hit as hard in terms of the density of the terrible secrets.

875
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:44,539
Scott: Yeah, I think if you made this as the thing is like the show is weird and that if you made it longer, you could give respect to those other characters, some of which could become really interesting and awesome characters if you did like having like just an episode where the main plot doesn't advance.

876
00:52:45,042 --> 00:52:45,263
Scott: Right.

877
00:52:45,363 --> 00:52:52,499
Scott: But they go fighting some bad guys or something and you spend that time, you know, developing or learning about some of these other characters in the show.

878
00:52:53,782 --> 00:52:57,020
Scott: But by having every episode be a heavy plot episode.

879
00:52:57,721 --> 00:52:57,983
Scott: Right.

880
00:52:58,064 --> 00:53:00,580
Scott: It moves along in a different way.

881
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:10,540
Rym: Well, you know, look at Attack on Titan is a good example of that, because that's the opposite of this in that it really, really, really focuses on the characters and like them doesn't move along.

882
00:53:11,043 --> 00:53:14,300
Rym: And the terrible secrets of space come like once every season.

883
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:16,355
Scott: Yeah, something like that.

884
00:53:18,462 --> 00:53:20,839
Scott: So, yeah, I think that's the balance that they struck here.

885
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:21,561
Scott: Right.

886
00:53:21,642 --> 00:53:25,540
Scott: And I think if it wasn't 12 episodes, I don't think I want to watch the whole thing, you know.

887
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:30,517
Rym: Unless imagine if it was just 12 more episodes of continuing secrets of space somehow.

888
00:53:32,363 --> 00:53:33,719
Scott: That I don't think that could happen.

889
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:38,300
Scott: You could do more episodes, but I don't think it ends pretty solidly.

890
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:38,784
Scott: Right.

891
00:53:38,805 --> 00:53:39,138
Scott: At least.

892
00:53:39,881 --> 00:53:48,540
Scott: I think if you wanted to continue this, I guess this isn't spoilers, you would have to go to a far away place in the same universe.

893
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:54,140
Scott: You could not really do much more writing in the same characters, same place.

894
00:53:55,763 --> 00:54:01,899
Scott: After the end of the show, you have to go to like, you know, another side of another planet, another galaxy, something, you know, something else.

895
00:54:03,202 --> 00:54:03,403
Scott: Right.

896
00:54:04,728 --> 00:54:08,140
Scott: Anyway, so what would I say about the show as a whole?

897
00:54:08,281 --> 00:54:10,360
Scott: I don't think it's actually like an A anime.

898
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:15,159
Rym: Yeah, I wasn't feeling that even from the beginning because I've seen some A anime recently.

899
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:40,380
Scott: Yeah, my feeling is like this is a B plus anime, but because it has unique qualities and because it is so short, only four hours long for the whole series, that I think it's actually worth, if you're an anime fan, right, an anime person, there's a lot, you know, if you've already seen the top tier animes, you got four hours to do nothing.

900
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:41,439
Scott: You're stuck at home all the time.

901
00:54:42,485 --> 00:54:43,340
Scott: Why not watch this?

902
00:54:43,561 --> 00:54:44,820
Scott: It's perfectly enjoyable.

903
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:46,938
Scott: I don't regret spending four hours on it.

904
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:49,760
Rym: B plus is the level of like a scrapped princess.

905
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:50,897
Scott: Like pretty good show.

906
00:54:51,761 --> 00:54:53,599
Scott: Like this is better than Scrap Princess for sure.

907
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,519
Rym: You didn't even watch all the Scrap Princess.

908
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:56,722
Scott: That's right.

909
00:54:56,943 --> 00:55:00,700
Rym: How far did you even get into Scrap Princess?

910
00:55:01,603 --> 00:55:02,500
Scott: A four or five episode.

911
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:03,699
Scott: I don't remember it that well.

912
00:55:04,530 --> 00:55:09,360
Scott: The point is, you know, this is a show that's well worth watching.

913
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,419
Scott: It will not become a legendary anime of all time.

914
00:55:13,201 --> 00:55:19,440
Rym: I feel like we might talk about it in a panel someday on the terrible secret of space or like the mid-season.

915
00:55:19,761 --> 00:55:20,525
Scott: I think it has.

916
00:55:20,565 --> 00:55:22,012
Scott: I think it has a lot of.

917
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:30,341
Scott: I don't think it has the kind of staying power where it's going to be a show that is like must watch like everyone's putting it on their lists.

918
00:55:30,762 --> 00:55:36,824
Scott: But I think it's a show that will sort of, you know, it will come it will come back up.

919
00:55:36,844 --> 00:55:38,340
Scott: People in discussions.

920
00:55:38,961 --> 00:55:39,203
Scott: Right.

921
00:55:39,303 --> 00:55:42,040
Scott: It will have some relevance and be brought back up.

922
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:54,820
Scott: And someone who's you know, if any if you're into anime any deeper than you just watch Akira and Ghost in the Shell and Miyazaki movies, if you're on the next level where you're like an anime fan, this show should be one that you that you watch.

923
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:55,685
Rym: Yeah, absolutely.

924
00:55:55,705 --> 00:55:56,269
Rym: I'm going to.

925
00:55:56,289 --> 00:55:57,316
Rym: I'm definitely going to finish it.

926
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:04,538
Scott: And because it's it's you know, it's kind of hard to surprise an anime fan who's seen many animes, right?

927
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:07,780
Rym: Yeah, I mean, I'd like kill la kill at that point.

928
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:10,220
Rym: I'm even like, all right, nothing really surprised me here.

929
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:11,048
Rym: I'm just into this.

930
00:56:11,978 --> 00:56:12,120
Scott: Yep.

931
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:18,000
Scott: So you got four hours decadence, you know, enjoy.

941
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:22,979
Rym: But now on this Wednesday, where very little happens to us in these covid times, no one's tried to fight me since this weekend.

942
00:57:23,201 --> 00:57:25,879
Rym: So we'll see the next time someone fights me and I have something fun to talk about.
