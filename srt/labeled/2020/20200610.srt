00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,340
Rym: It's Wednesday, June 10th, 2020.

2
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:11,762
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,263 --> 00:00:14,029
Scott: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:14,069 --> 00:00:19,990
Rym: tonight We are talking about the Netflix anime ghost in the shell standalone complex.

5
00:00:24,872 --> 00:00:25,908
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,246 --> 00:00:34,628
Scott: So it's a little tough to bike right now Even though there is such beautiful weather outside.

7
00:00:34,989 --> 00:00:37,496
Scott: and now if you know, I could bike all I want.

8
00:00:37,977 --> 00:00:41,730
Scott: but not only is There a deadly virus out there that might get me.

9
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:44,459
Scott: I gotta be precarious, you know cautious about that.

10
00:00:44,781 --> 00:00:47,250
Rym: Yeah, we got to bring all your was also with you, right?

11
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,820
Scott: There's also many protests out there that I fully support.

12
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:55,720
Scott: But protests, you know, you don't want a bike, you know to go with a bike protest.

13
00:00:55,921 --> 00:00:57,426
Scott: I've seen a lot of those and it's like man.

14
00:00:57,466 --> 00:00:59,512
Scott: I want to go on that bike protest so bad.

15
00:00:59,532 --> 00:01:01,659
Scott: Yeah, but deadly virus.

16
00:01:02,961 --> 00:01:09,563
Scott: I'll wait and see if any of those bike protesters get deadly virus the same way that like I'm gonna be second in line for Cybernetic implants.

17
00:01:09,824 --> 00:01:13,536
Scott: Yeah, I'm gonna be second in line for will the bike protest?

18
00:01:13,576 --> 00:01:14,660
Scott: give me the corona virus?

19
00:01:15,801 --> 00:01:21,040
Scott: If none of the bike protesters end up with corona virus then expect to see me at your local bike protest soon.

20
00:01:21,726 --> 00:01:22,957
Scott: But I'm waiting in the scene right now.

21
00:01:23,467 --> 00:01:36,647
Rym: Yeah anyway briefly on a run because I could kind of stop and just walk along the edge of it for a while and Instead I took the solo action of harassing basically every cop I saw on my 14 mile run, which was 12 sets of cops Interestingly a lot.

22
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:43,799
Rym: while they were all out mostly Surrounding City Hall they had a barricade around Gracie Mansion wouldn't let anyone get anywhere near it.

23
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,650
Scott: You keep saying City Hall City Hall is so far away from there.

24
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:51,098
Rym: Yeah, Gracie Mansion, New York City has Gracie Mansion Which is basically the mayor's house.

25
00:01:52,084 --> 00:01:53,359
Scott: Yeah, there's like a special house.

26
00:01:53,962 --> 00:01:59,560
Rym: You can read about the history of it on the internet and it's like on the east side bike and running, right?

27
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,940
Scott: It's on the east side of Manhattan sort of north ish like Upper East Side on the water on the East River.

28
00:02:05,101 --> 00:02:05,865
Scott: It's like a mansion.

29
00:02:05,885 --> 00:02:10,899
Scott: It's old and if you become mayor of New York Congratulations, you get to live in it.

30
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,200
Scott: Yeah You don't have to live wherever you live before.

31
00:02:13,581 --> 00:02:18,019
Scott: You can move into that house and sleep there and just sort of like the president can move into the White House, right?

32
00:02:19,521 --> 00:02:24,297
Scott: You know so but the City Hall where the mayor works is hella downtown far away from there.

33
00:02:24,358 --> 00:02:31,619
Scott: Yep so So yeah hard to bike right now like I was saying protests, right.

34
00:02:32,842 --> 00:02:39,092
Scott: Part of the problem for them is if you want to bike around Even if you're not joining the protest that there's been a protest recently.

35
00:02:39,494 --> 00:02:43,466
Scott: the street is full of crap Especially like broken glass.

36
00:02:43,486 --> 00:02:44,670
Scott: You don't want to bike there.

37
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:47,300
Scott: Yeah, so it limits the places you can go.

38
00:02:49,162 --> 00:02:52,800
Scott: So yeah, not a lot of biking outside going on especially and not commuting to any office.

39
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:59,955
Scott: So The option I have is to do some sort of stationary bicycling indoors.

40
00:02:59,995 --> 00:03:01,400
Scott: That's perfectly safe, right?

41
00:03:02,544 --> 00:03:14,410
Scott: the thing is I had a stationary bike trainer thing and I bought the cheapo crappiest one if way many years ago in my you know, and It wasn't broken.

42
00:03:14,451 --> 00:03:21,813
Scott: It was only partially broken But it only seemed to work with the bike that I no longer have Like when I bought it.

43
00:03:22,055 --> 00:03:26,096
Scott: when I bought it I had this hybrid bike and that was my only bike and it worked with that bike.

44
00:03:26,156 --> 00:03:26,900
Scott: just fine, right?

45
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,430
Scott: It was a wheel on style, right?

46
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:32,659
Scott: You don't take the tire off your bike And it was loud as hell.

47
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:35,579
Rym: Loud as hell is a deal-breaker for me.

48
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:44,420
Scott: But when I tried to use my other bikes on it It just didn't fit properly even though they were also quick release bikes with the same tire size and everything.

49
00:03:45,844 --> 00:04:03,380
Scott: so I got rid of that when I moved and I've since learned that the other style of bike trainer where you take your tire off and you direct drive a flywheel Are vastly superior and perfect and great And quiet as we get a good one, right and super awesome.

50
00:04:04,082 --> 00:04:08,700
Scott: And but there's one that is made by the same company Wahoo that makes my bike computer.

51
00:04:08,941 --> 00:04:10,228
Scott: So I was like, oh, I'll get that one.

52
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:11,837
Scott: It's a really good one.

53
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:13,525
Scott: Apparently It's like $1,100, which is a fortune.

54
00:04:18,421 --> 00:04:20,365
Scott: Maybe I still might get one.

55
00:04:20,425 --> 00:04:21,567
Scott: Maybe probably not though.

56
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:24,936
Rym: There will be a winter again someday, but the right.

57
00:04:24,956 --> 00:04:29,700
Scott: but the point is that They're out of stock and they've been out of stock for a long time.

58
00:04:30,243 --> 00:04:32,173
Scott: I saw one on the internet.

59
00:04:32,253 --> 00:04:33,520
Scott: Someone was selling a used one.

60
00:04:33,681 --> 00:04:38,110
Scott: I think that they were too stupid to get their bike to fit on it Like they didn't know how to adjust it properly.

61
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,543
Scott: and they were like, it doesn't fit on my bike I'm selling it.

62
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:42,533
Scott: and they were selling it for 700. and I was like, oh shit.

63
00:04:42,553 --> 00:04:42,814
Scott: Oh shit.

64
00:04:42,835 --> 00:04:43,860
Scott: Oh shit, and they didn't reply.

65
00:04:44,762 --> 00:04:46,900
Scott: I think they sold it to someone else or figured it out.

66
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,379
Scott: So my building that I live in has a gym in it a game.

67
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:58,860
Scott: Yeah, oh Yeah that I never would go into what you know because I don't exercise.

68
00:04:59,981 --> 00:05:03,960
Scott: But it has some stationary bicycles in it that I never investigated.

69
00:05:06,121 --> 00:05:06,944
Scott: But but it's like.

70
00:05:06,984 --> 00:05:07,848
Scott: well now's the time.

71
00:05:07,888 --> 00:05:10,096
Scott: I'm stuck inside now, I actually want to go in there.

72
00:05:10,136 --> 00:05:10,477
Scott: guess what.

73
00:05:10,497 --> 00:05:11,180
Scott: they closed the guy.

74
00:05:11,385 --> 00:05:13,263
Scott: Yeah Can't go in.

75
00:05:13,303 --> 00:05:13,966
Scott: they close the guy.

76
00:05:14,006 --> 00:05:15,372
Scott: I'm as soon as I'm about to use it, right.

77
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:20,693
Scott: and then just yesterday They opened the guy and I'm like, well still trapped inside.

78
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:22,540
Scott: So let's go check it out Scott.

79
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,807
Rym: And a guy I know right.

80
00:05:24,847 --> 00:05:28,056
Scott: so I go and I check it out and actually it just so happens.

81
00:05:28,097 --> 00:05:34,369
Scott: the XD stationary bicycles that are in my buildings game are Terrific.

82
00:05:35,862 --> 00:05:37,651
Scott: Like it's a regular bike saddle.

83
00:05:37,691 --> 00:05:39,359
Scott: It's not one of those weird seat things.

84
00:05:40,061 --> 00:05:42,187
Scott: Right, it's fully adjustable.

85
00:05:42,669 --> 00:05:46,640
Scott: It has a computer that has every feature you want except maybe for like connectivity.

86
00:05:47,144 --> 00:05:49,060
Scott: It does have connectivity to like a heart monitor.

87
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,640
Scott: But I guess you have to get the one that goes with that bike which I don't know.

88
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,527
Rym: There are some open standards around that.

89
00:05:54,607 --> 00:05:55,992
Rym: but you got a Google to make sure.

90
00:05:56,213 --> 00:06:07,865
Scott: I don't think it follows any of them And I don't care anyway even has SPE clips in the pedals it's like and it was super silent and There's absolutely nothing wrong with it.

91
00:06:07,945 --> 00:06:15,959
Scott: So I guess I don't need to buy some bike trainer for $1,100 But I still would much rather bike outside.

92
00:06:16,582 --> 00:06:19,033
Rym: Well get there you can bike outside you just can't.

93
00:06:19,053 --> 00:06:20,720
Rym: you have to bike the whole way there and back.

94
00:06:20,801 --> 00:06:22,279
Rym: You can't like it on a train to get home.

95
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:32,198
Scott: I really but that's the thing is most of the bike riding I do nowadays is bike far And take a train home or take a train and bike home and I you know not being able to do either.

96
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:34,578
Rym: one is me You know, he's getting a mountain biking instead.

97
00:06:35,501 --> 00:06:36,226
Scott: Mountain biking sucks.

98
00:06:36,508 --> 00:06:37,434
Rym: My miking is awesome.

99
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:46,734
Rym: No So anyway in the news Just in case any of you think that somehow media can escape this or be a political like.

100
00:06:46,754 --> 00:06:51,272
Rym: now it's here to black lives matter And there's a lot of protests going on for a reason.

101
00:06:51,292 --> 00:06:58,115
Scott: I had a goal of Find black lives matter content for like every thread even unrelated threads.

102
00:06:58,256 --> 00:06:59,420
Rym: I saw you doing that in the forum.

103
00:06:59,701 --> 00:07:01,933
Scott: I'm gonna see but it was too easy.

104
00:07:02,053 --> 00:07:03,400
Scott: It was like I got it in the kit.

105
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,599
Scott: I can get it in the kpop thread.

106
00:07:05,761 --> 00:07:07,387
Scott: It's like it's like every sport.

107
00:07:07,467 --> 00:07:11,220
Scott: it's like no matter what thing you pick that seems unrelated to the world.

108
00:07:11,642 --> 00:07:14,980
Scott: It's like I can find a related black lives matter thing.

109
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,213
Scott: So it's like it was such not a challenge to do that.

110
00:07:18,233 --> 00:07:19,337
Scott: I didn't I stopped doing it.

111
00:07:19,437 --> 00:07:27,112
Rym: It's like Yep, but somehow these companies have a lot of trouble hiring black people.

112
00:07:27,132 --> 00:07:28,837
Rym: Oh, I wonder why.

113
00:07:28,857 --> 00:07:29,659
Rym: yeah, I wonder why.

114
00:07:29,679 --> 00:07:34,534
Rym: so Yeah, if you're not paying attention to the news obviously there's a lot of protests going on.

115
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:35,497
Rym: they're all basically 100% justified.

116
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,892
Rym: We've mentioned this repeatedly.

117
00:07:39,234 --> 00:07:40,019
Rym: We're still doing the show.

118
00:07:40,481 --> 00:07:42,850
Rym: We skip shows last week because the momentum had to grow.

119
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:43,834
Rym: the momentum is still there.

120
00:07:43,854 --> 00:07:48,940
Rym: We're doing GeekNights again But right now we're not live streaming and you'll notice if you follow us in social media.

121
00:07:49,441 --> 00:07:52,528
Rym: We're not really talking about our nerdy stuff on social media.

122
00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:55,896
Rym: We're really only talking about it here on GeekNights.

123
00:07:56,438 --> 00:07:59,123
Rym: So no It's like.

124
00:07:59,163 --> 00:07:59,424
Scott: really.

125
00:07:59,464 --> 00:08:01,293
Scott: is anyone even listening to geek guys these days?

126
00:08:01,393 --> 00:08:02,840
Scott: it's like I'm not listening to podcast.

127
00:08:03,081 --> 00:08:04,346
Rym: Yeah, the only podcast.

128
00:08:04,366 --> 00:08:13,997
Scott: I'm listening to our political podcast about the situation Although I might because you know with the heavy, you know bike nights being in one non moving location.

129
00:08:14,438 --> 00:08:14,739
Rym: Yeah

130
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:16,442
Scott: The

131
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:35,510
Rym: other thing you could do is watch a really boring anime like the one we're about to talk about while you're fighting on a tablet but I'm gonna make sure we're gonna talk about some aspect of this every week in the news in addition to our normal nerdy stuff and If you're not up for that You don't really need to be a fan of ours.

132
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:36,072
Rym: You're welcome.

133
00:08:36,111 --> 00:08:36,693
Scott: How are you?

134
00:08:36,754 --> 00:08:38,280
Scott: How are you still a fan of ours?

135
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:46,376
Rym: Understand how people will like follow us for a decade and then one day be like who you've gotten political.

136
00:08:46,637 --> 00:08:50,711
Rym: you have lost my Respect and It was a listener who is totally cool.

137
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:58,160
Scott: And there was one point where I was like, I think on some episode I said my phone number and I was like I challenged people to text me.

138
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:04,280
Scott: I remember that and this one dude texted me and he just had conversations with me about totally normal nerdy stuff.

139
00:09:05,123 --> 00:09:13,317
Scott: You know so and like sometimes like instead of using the forum or email like occasionally after an episode Like like the day after I'd get a text from that listener.

140
00:09:13,337 --> 00:09:20,760
Scott: Yeah Right and he would always just be some normal nerdy thing like just commenting on the episode like a normal person.

141
00:09:21,063 --> 00:09:31,389
Scott: Right, totally totally chill until one day Texted me with like some Trump pro-trump Nonsense and I'm like what the fuck.

142
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,456
Scott: and I was just like don't text me again.

143
00:09:33,616 --> 00:09:35,822
Scott: and they said, okay Of course.

144
00:09:36,023 --> 00:09:43,366
Rym: The other thing I get on the YouTube channel pretty regularly on every random video is There'll be people who were like, hey, what are you guys gonna start with you ten a thing again?

145
00:09:43,386 --> 00:09:50,530
Rym: I got one of those today But to the thing that gets the most comments is this dumb video I made a few years ago.

146
00:09:50,590 --> 00:10:02,970
Rym: that's literally just that scene where Twilight Sparkle in my little pony becomes an alicorn and she like Disappears and I cut to the credits right after that and I was like the death of Twilight Sparkle at least once a week.

147
00:10:03,111 --> 00:10:10,102
Rym: Someone will post a comment in that video Extremely angry trying to explain that you got to keep watching the show.

148
00:10:10,182 --> 00:10:11,125
Rym: There's another episode.

149
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:11,768
Rym: She comes back.

150
00:10:11,828 --> 00:10:12,510
Rym: She's not dead.

151
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,598
Rym: This video is a lie.

152
00:10:13,638 --> 00:10:19,281
Rym: This person doesn't know what they're talking about and It just warms the cockles of my heart to see people like that.

153
00:10:19,843 --> 00:10:20,767
Scott: They know they don't get it.

154
00:10:20,928 --> 00:10:24,701
Rym: They don't have But at least they don't get it about something that doesn't matter.

155
00:10:24,741 --> 00:10:30,030
Rym: the people who don't get it about the stuff that matters Hard block like if I see you out there on Twitter.

156
00:10:31,011 --> 00:10:33,017
Scott: It's the same problem right.

157
00:10:33,078 --> 00:10:33,579
Scott: it's like they.

158
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:40,907
Scott: you know the a person sees a thing and doesn't understand You know the thing isn't literally saying what it literally says.

159
00:10:41,188 --> 00:10:43,556
Rym: yep So you're gonna get at least one.

160
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:50,860
Scott: the same kind of person who looks at death of Twilight Sparkle and says she's not dead Is the same person who looks at Black Lives Matter?

161
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,064
Scott: It says all lives matter.

162
00:10:52,325 --> 00:10:56,399
Scott: They're caught up in the semantic Reality or they're willfully obtuse.

163
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,764
Rym: don't discount how many guys.

164
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:02,039
Scott: just willfully obtuse yes But you know the the meaning is lost.

165
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:05,872
Rym: true right but a guiding principle on GeekNights has always been that we try to cross Pollinate.

166
00:11:05,892 --> 00:11:12,161
Rym: like this is the Wednesday anime show, but the news will do some anime news But we'll sprinkle in other things and things of the day we got.

167
00:11:12,181 --> 00:11:17,603
Rym: we're trying to get the anime nerd to play video games And I've got all anime comic stuff to play a different game.

168
00:11:17,623 --> 00:11:19,390
Scott: I don't have any cross stuff today.

169
00:11:19,533 --> 00:11:19,981
Scott: I only go.

170
00:11:20,286 --> 00:11:25,910
Rym: yeah But you're gonna see at least like news about the real world every GeekNights for the foreseeable future.

171
00:11:26,231 --> 00:11:27,855
Rym: Cuz the protests are working.

172
00:11:27,955 --> 00:11:40,161
Rym: so this news before we get into the nerdy stuff about comics is that you might have noticed a Whole lot of racist statues got torn down By concerned citizens in the last few days, and this is a vice.

173
00:11:40,181 --> 00:11:42,490
Scott: got any racist statues near you, right?

174
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,800
Scott: Let's make a racist statue tear down our club.

175
00:11:45,101 --> 00:11:47,994
Scott: Yeah, I help you tear down yours You help me tear down mine.

176
00:11:48,255 --> 00:11:57,605
Rym: so vice put down at just a nice compilation of all the ones that were torn down like really recently Mmm, and they're good photos good stuff.

177
00:11:57,887 --> 00:11:59,353
Rym: keep it also Please post.

178
00:11:59,393 --> 00:12:01,880
Scott: I've seen other people posting threads of good statues.

179
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,384
Scott: Please post more good statues.

180
00:12:03,665 --> 00:12:09,610
Scott: It's hard to top that Bruce Lee statue I mean the best statue on earth is still Freddie Mercury statue, right?

181
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:13,083
Rym: Yeah, I would say that at least in the top ten is Joe Louis's fist.

182
00:12:13,846 --> 00:12:14,670
Scott: you like I could do.

183
00:12:14,952 --> 00:12:16,524
Scott: I know you love a Joe Louis fist.

184
00:12:16,565 --> 00:12:18,597
Scott: I'm down with that Yeah, but yeah frozen cuz.

185
00:12:18,657 --> 00:12:22,394
Rym: I could critique that statue from a number of angles But I do appreciate that.

186
00:12:22,434 --> 00:12:23,497
Rym: It is just a big fist.

187
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:37,510
Scott: Yeah, I do like, you know, I do like classic statues Even though they're very white right like a like a Michelangelo David or uh, you know that kind of statue Right, you know, but you know this, you know, they're better than a fucking racist.

188
00:12:39,951 --> 00:12:50,030
Rym: So, yeah, keep your eyes on that stuff and if you have money to spare I would recommend donating it to one of the many causes We will link to related to the Black Lives Matter movement and the current situation.

189
00:12:51,471 --> 00:13:07,024
Scott: So in other news diamond might finally get destroyed Mel half destroy, so we've talked about this on GeekNights Frequently, but for anyone who still doesn't know the deal The way comic book stores in the United States work is.

190
00:13:07,064 --> 00:13:10,518
Scott: there is a company called diamond distributors Marvel and DC.

191
00:13:10,538 --> 00:13:17,010
Scott: like 25 30 years ago Right signed exclusive distribution deals with diamond distributors.

192
00:13:17,191 --> 00:13:24,906
Scott: So if you the floppy ass comic books that you get in comic book stores Right would only be sold through diamond distributors and through no one else.

193
00:13:24,926 --> 00:13:27,957
Scott: So your comic book store You put your order in with diamond distributors.

194
00:13:27,997 --> 00:13:34,088
Scott: They send you comic books and it was a special direct Distribution deal, right?

195
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:44,657
Scott: so if you're a bookstore and you buy a book and you don't sell it you tear the cover off and you tell or you destroy it completely and you tell the Distributor that you bought books from.

196
00:13:44,697 --> 00:13:45,561
Scott: you didn't sell the book.

197
00:13:45,581 --> 00:13:50,541
Scott: Yeah, and they give you your money back Right because you return the book, right?

198
00:13:50,721 --> 00:13:53,270
Scott: They just don't want you to actually return the paper, right?

199
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:56,109
Scott: But you're only paying for books that you sell through to customers.

200
00:13:56,632 --> 00:13:58,320
Scott: comic book stores doesn't work that way.

201
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:02,016
Scott: comic book stores pay for all the comics and They can't return them.

202
00:14:02,036 --> 00:14:03,950
Scott: They either sell them or they're stuck with them.

203
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:09,130
Scott: Which is why you see like dollar bins and bargain basement comic bins because comic book stores are stuck with these things.

204
00:14:09,531 --> 00:14:11,056
Rym: Now sometimes this happens in other areas.

205
00:14:11,076 --> 00:14:15,250
Rym: there was stuff way back with D&D books and TSR where a similar weird situation happened.

206
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:22,590
Rym: So this right district supply chain distribution semi monopolies and weird structures are a thing in a lot of places.

207
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:32,319
Scott: But comics are particularly noteworthy and egregious right but by having this monopoly distribution with the no returnables They were able to sell comic books for cheaper.

208
00:14:32,359 --> 00:14:35,611
Scott: if they had to be returnable the price would go way up Right.

209
00:14:35,652 --> 00:14:36,996
Scott: comic books would be too expensive.

210
00:14:37,037 --> 00:14:38,040
Scott: They print them in color.

211
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,730
Scott: They have to pay artists and writers a lot, right?

212
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:44,629
Scott: They don't have as many advertisers, but then they used to don't sell as many copies as they used to.

213
00:14:44,952 --> 00:14:46,583
Scott: They still put them out every month, right?

214
00:14:46,623 --> 00:14:47,630
Scott: There's a whole whole thing.

215
00:14:49,376 --> 00:15:08,966
Scott: so People have been complaining about this whole situation Because while it had a purpose when it started which is to save comics from fucking themselves It's now, you know since then obviously it's been a bad deal for comic book stores and for readers overall.

216
00:15:08,986 --> 00:15:12,310
Scott: and What happened was is because of the virus situation?

217
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:16,870
Scott: Diamond stopped distributing for a little bit right a couple months there.

218
00:15:17,991 --> 00:15:27,284
Scott: So DC which was coming up to the end of its exclusive contract term with D with diamond said alright We're gonna try a little bit with some other distributors while you're shut down.

219
00:15:27,364 --> 00:15:28,790
Scott: We'll see how it goes, right?

220
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:29,845
Scott: We'll take this opportunity.

221
00:15:29,946 --> 00:15:39,910
Scott: So to comic retailers right one that I am a customer of Discount complex service DCB service calm and another one that I don't know.

222
00:15:40,892 --> 00:15:41,938
Scott: I would mention it if I knew.

223
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:43,950
Scott: I'm not trying to like favor one over the other.

224
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:46,880
Rym: Yeah, you probably have a friend who's into comics who mentions DCBS.

225
00:15:46,901 --> 00:15:49,510
Rym: That's basically like hope nerds who like know exactly right?

226
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:50,372
Scott: So it right.

227
00:15:50,412 --> 00:15:54,565
Scott: so what DCBS and this and does is they they?

228
00:15:54,666 --> 00:16:00,492
Scott: they're a customer of diamonds Just like everyone else right, but they're an online Shop.

229
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,921
Scott: so they have so many customers and they order.

230
00:16:02,981 --> 00:16:09,710
Scott: they have such a large order with diamond that they get the highest Discount level and they passed most of that discount on to the customer.

231
00:16:10,152 --> 00:16:13,124
Scott: So if you order from DCBS you get a huge discount.

232
00:16:13,184 --> 00:16:17,482
Scott: and also because you pre-order Right DCBS doesn't have.

233
00:16:17,502 --> 00:16:19,270
Scott: they're not stuck holding a bunch of comics.

234
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:25,410
Scott: They can't sell the way local comic shop has to buy a hundred copies of spider-man and doesn't know how many they're gonna sell.

235
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:26,258
Scott: Right they had to guess.

236
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:27,450
Scott: and they're stuck with extra spider.

237
00:16:27,711 --> 00:16:33,230
Rym: And if they buy these men they'll either run out and have a problem or they have to get a lower dis or get a lower.

238
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:35,558
Rym: Just pay more per spider-man right?

239
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:38,730
Scott: so DCBS says how many pure orders we got for spider-man?

240
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:43,110
Scott: And it's always enough to reach the highest discount level because they're an online shop with tons of customers.

241
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:47,294
Scott: Oh, and they say oh we need exactly 462 spider-man's.

242
00:16:47,315 --> 00:16:48,661
Scott: I guess that's how many we're gonna order.

243
00:16:48,721 --> 00:16:49,565
Scott: will order 475 or whatever?

244
00:16:49,585 --> 00:16:51,916
Scott: the Number is right.

245
00:16:51,997 --> 00:16:52,640
Scott: you have to order.

246
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,671
Scott: I don't think they'll let you order for 62.

247
00:16:55,671 --> 00:16:56,313
Scott: You get the idea.

248
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:58,502
Scott: They're not stuck holding a bunch of extra spider-man's.

249
00:16:58,823 --> 00:17:00,570
Scott: they pass that savings on to the customer.

250
00:17:00,711 --> 00:17:01,414
Scott: It's a great deal.

251
00:17:01,976 --> 00:17:04,445
Scott: and of course because of the way they do this business.

252
00:17:04,465 --> 00:17:05,390
Scott: They have a huge warehouse.

253
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:11,589
Scott: That's all a fucking distributor is is a huge warehouse that gets visited by UPS and FedEx every day constantly.

254
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,940
Scott: Yeah, that's all a distributor is right.

255
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,748
Scott: You don't own trucks right?

256
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:24,708
Scott: so DCBS and some other people doing similar businesses were in a position to be distributors because they were huge retailers.

257
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:34,590
Scott: right and Diamond said I DCBS started a company called lunar distribution and someone else so I don't know started a company called UCS comic book distributors.

258
00:17:36,051 --> 00:17:37,175
Scott: And DC is like.

259
00:17:37,195 --> 00:17:37,596
Scott: you know what.

260
00:17:37,616 --> 00:17:42,190
Scott: we tried these two out during the virus situation when diamond wasn't working.

261
00:17:43,171 --> 00:17:44,073
Scott: That's what we're going with.

262
00:17:44,154 --> 00:17:44,956
Scott: fuck you diamond.

263
00:17:45,056 --> 00:17:50,030
Rym: Yep right now honestly to be clear that the virus situation is almost definitely just the excuse.

264
00:17:51,072 --> 00:17:54,629
Rym: People have been having issues with diamond for a long time.

265
00:17:55,332 --> 00:18:06,906
Scott: It's sort of like DC was thinking about moving away, and the virus just gave him the chance to Try out the alternative to seal the deal the same way that like I wouldn't have.

266
00:18:07,027 --> 00:18:12,370
Scott: I only thought about Going to use that stationary bike in my building, and I wouldn't have if it were not for this.

267
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:15,076
Scott: Okay, it's the same deal.

268
00:18:15,156 --> 00:18:29,337
Scott: so now DC comic books will no longer distribute through diamond and They will only distribute through lunar and UCS Which means if you are a comic book store who wants DC comic books you want Batman on your shelf Which I bet you do.

269
00:18:29,357 --> 00:18:32,936
Scott: if you're a comic book store You need some Batman's.

270
00:18:33,337 --> 00:18:36,950
Scott: you now have to send an order form to diamond every month to get your spider-man.

271
00:18:37,532 --> 00:18:43,170
Scott: You're gonna have to also pick UCS and or lunar to send an order form to order your Batman.

272
00:18:43,412 --> 00:18:48,969
Rym: But as soon as I have to deal with two distributors Then it I have to have infrastructure to deal with more than one.

273
00:18:49,432 --> 00:18:56,402
Rym: Dealing with three is not much harder than dealing with two But dealing with two is a way harder than dealing with one.

274
00:18:56,422 --> 00:19:00,499
Scott: also means that if you're gonna look at your pre-order form Right so now I'm gonna.

275
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:00,720
Scott: Well.

276
00:19:00,841 --> 00:19:02,530
Scott: I'm using I'm a DC BS customer.

277
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:13,690
Scott: So this is actually gonna be great because I probably won't order that many DC things, but if I were to I Would be getting them straight from the distributor, right?

278
00:19:14,593 --> 00:19:18,807
Scott: But everything else I'm ordering through a retailer that's buying from diamond as I always have.

279
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:19,590
Scott: it's not any different.

280
00:19:19,751 --> 00:19:23,468
Scott: Yeah, but if you are to say go and order comic books right you get.

281
00:19:23,649 --> 00:19:23,810
Scott: you know.

282
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:28,676
Scott: There's a catalog of the previews catalog Which is the catalog you order diamond things from.

283
00:19:29,278 --> 00:19:41,310
Scott: there is now presumably going to be a second catalog that is like the DC only Catalog that will come out on some basis, or maybe there'll be two DC catalogs one from UCS and one from lunar.

284
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:52,350
Scott: I don't even know how that's gonna work but the previews catalog that comes from diamond won't have any DC products in it and Those products will be in some separate catalog you have to get separately somewhere.

285
00:19:52,933 --> 00:19:53,194
Scott: You know.

286
00:19:53,214 --> 00:19:54,882
Scott: maybe I don't know if the comic book shop will have it.

287
00:19:54,922 --> 00:19:56,369
Scott: the comic shop usually has previews.

288
00:19:57,932 --> 00:19:58,979
Rym: Yeah, we'll see what happens.

289
00:19:59,221 --> 00:20:09,833
Rym: what I wonder is interesting Smaller distribution like people who don't wouldn't work with diamond like smaller shops like really small comic publication shops And those sorts of things.

290
00:20:10,655 --> 00:20:15,790
Rym: I think it might be easier for them to start getting in the door with lower-tier distributors.

291
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:19,281
Scott: Exactly this opens up so many possibilities.

292
00:20:19,402 --> 00:20:23,742
Scott: will Indy you know cuz Marvel I guess is stuck with diamond for however long.

293
00:20:23,762 --> 00:20:24,848
Scott: who knows what they're gonna do right?

294
00:20:24,868 --> 00:20:33,349
Rym: yeah I'd love to see when their contract is up for renewal because that is a date that I would just Set a reminder for to see what's in the news the next day.

295
00:20:33,953 --> 00:20:38,858
Scott: Yeah, also remember that the books that are going to Barnes & Noble borders They're going through yet another distributor.

296
00:20:38,878 --> 00:20:41,550
Scott: They're not going through diamond right because those are returnable.

297
00:20:42,732 --> 00:20:44,197
Scott: But like okay does this mean Indy?

298
00:20:44,237 --> 00:20:55,265
Scott: comic book companies say from you know image IDW But also little guys right manga is sold through diamond right yeah Could they switch to lunar or UCS or someone else.

299
00:20:55,405 --> 00:20:56,109
Scott: yeah, right?

300
00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:00,122
Scott: What about you know you just start up out of nowhere right?

301
00:21:00,323 --> 00:21:01,146
Scott: you know you want to make.

302
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:02,713
Scott: come you make a comic book in Your garage.

303
00:21:03,316 --> 00:21:04,904
Scott: maybe lunar will distribute it for you.

304
00:21:04,944 --> 00:21:05,406
Scott: who knows?

305
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:06,070
Rym: yeah?

306
00:21:06,371 --> 00:21:15,850
Rym: Or maybe literally more willing to work with whoever you get to do your primary distribution because you're low-tier like They'll be more willing to take on this weird stuff to build a big report.

307
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,956
Scott: Go on to get listed in previews.

308
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:20,584
Scott: you have to have a certain like quantity or whatever.

309
00:21:20,604 --> 00:21:22,650
Scott: so there's certain rules about it.

310
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:23,854
Scott: Maybe the rules will be different.

311
00:21:24,175 --> 00:21:24,696
Scott: Yeah, I'm in.

312
00:21:24,736 --> 00:21:28,769
Scott: comic books ships their comic books to comic book stores on Wednesdays right.

313
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:30,818
Scott: typically I believe that's comic day right.

314
00:21:30,838 --> 00:21:33,610
Scott: so a lot of comic stores have new product on Wednesday slash Thursday.

315
00:21:34,653 --> 00:21:35,907
Scott: Will lunar have a different day?

316
00:21:37,674 --> 00:21:42,849
Scott: Does this mean if you're the person who shops at a physical comic book store that you got to go in twice a week?

317
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:47,590
Scott: Right under your underwear pervert guy you got to get your comic books the day they come out.

318
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:52,653
Scott: You got to go to comic store twice a week once to get the Batman's the day it comes out and once to get the Spider-man the day.

319
00:21:52,693 --> 00:21:56,350
Rym: well no because that person has that person has their pull list anyway.

320
00:21:56,952 --> 00:22:00,043
Scott: I'm just saying right like these are things that I'm not saying.

321
00:22:00,063 --> 00:22:01,910
Scott: it could still be Wednesdays, right?

322
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:04,979
Scott: But it's like these small things can make a big difference.

323
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:14,328
Scott: if people of customers are coming to the complex store more frequently right or maybe less frequently or Me you know maybe the comic book prices will be different for DZ comic.

324
00:22:14,649 --> 00:22:27,070
Rym: yeah But look at how disruptive this is gonna be to the existing comic distribution model because frankly Floppy comics in the US are a weird niche market that doesn't behave like almost any other market.

325
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:32,549
Scott: There's all sorts of other products too, right if you're a comic book store that you go to decides to go with lunar versus UCS.

326
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,277
Scott: Will there be a difference between the two?

327
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,649
Scott: yeah well the complex store order from both.

328
00:22:37,454 --> 00:22:39,929
Rym: What if lunar starts also distributing paintball gear?

329
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:41,451
Scott: I'm just.

330
00:22:41,752 --> 00:22:46,768
Rym: I'm just thinking back to how many comic shops make their actual money by also selling airsoft or paintball.

331
00:22:47,189 --> 00:22:56,888
Scott: well Diamond doesn't distribute airsoft and paintball, but they distribute toys games magazine t-shirts apparel Gundam models like the.

332
00:22:57,712 --> 00:23:03,310
Scott: Every nerdy thing that you need to put on the shelves in a comic book store is in the diamond previews catalog.

333
00:23:03,471 --> 00:23:05,798
Scott: So what will be in the lunar catalog?

334
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:14,070
Scott: right there's so many doors this opens in terms And will the competition drive down prices right between the distributors there?

335
00:23:14,271 --> 00:23:15,818
Scott: They get a margin to will they?

336
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:18,529
Scott: will diamond try to shrink their margin, right?

337
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:22,437
Rym: How much take slack exists within diamond?

338
00:23:22,497 --> 00:23:29,318
Rym: how much of diamond was just rent seeking from this niche market where they're basically the only Game in time because they were a monopoly?

339
00:23:29,338 --> 00:23:31,849
Scott: now the non monopoly competition has appeared, right?

340
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:39,250
Scott: There's so many things that can happen now for nerds acquiring nerdy things in the US especially comic books.

341
00:23:40,697 --> 00:23:51,469
Rym: It's exciting times Yeah and it hits at a time when like floppy comic distribution and like how people interact with comics is already changing rapidly like Irrespective of the virus or any of these changes.

342
00:23:53,994 --> 00:24:05,864
Scott: So really yeah talk to you if you're a person that goes to the comic store Talk to your local comic book store provider About this situation and see what they have to say about it.

343
00:24:06,346 --> 00:24:09,106
Scott: if it's an old white guy they'll probably be cranky and upset.

344
00:24:09,389 --> 00:24:16,221
Scott: or Maybe they're the one or the but they might be cranky and upset at Diamond or cranky and upset at the change.

345
00:24:16,301 --> 00:24:16,603
Scott: It's 50/50, right?

346
00:24:18,711 --> 00:24:23,107
Scott: You know, basically complex store owner is always going to be complaining about no matter what they're.

347
00:24:23,127 --> 00:24:31,277
Rym: that kind of person Stereotypically, so real real brief geek bite because I watched a bunch of a show that a lot of you I've seen a lot of people talking about.

348
00:24:31,318 --> 00:24:32,263
Rym: it's got a couple seasons.

349
00:24:32,725 --> 00:24:33,650
Rym: It's on Netflix.

350
00:24:34,171 --> 00:24:38,498
Rym: It's called Kipo and the age of wonder beasts, it's just not heard of it.

351
00:24:38,858 --> 00:24:39,920
Rym: really not at all.

352
00:24:40,992 --> 00:24:42,517
Scott: No, I've heard of Kupo.

353
00:24:42,537 --> 00:24:45,870
Scott: the thing how says because you realize this is a DreamWorks?

354
00:24:46,951 --> 00:24:47,232
Scott: Okay.

355
00:24:47,392 --> 00:24:47,954
Rym: Yeah DreamWorks.

356
00:24:48,014 --> 00:24:48,897
Scott: I don't think I've liked.

357
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:53,030
Scott: I don't think I've ever watched and liked any DreamWorks thing.

358
00:24:53,471 --> 00:24:54,253
Scott: Let me look at a list.

359
00:24:54,815 --> 00:24:54,955
Rym: Yeah.

360
00:24:54,975 --> 00:24:58,144
Rym: Well, this is specifically DreamWorks animation television.

361
00:24:58,605 --> 00:25:00,570
Scott: Yeah list of DreamWorks animated productions.

362
00:25:01,234 --> 00:25:02,603
Scott: If I like you can just keep going.

363
00:25:02,623 --> 00:25:03,770
Scott: I'm gonna see if I liked any of this.

364
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:08,384
Rym: This one is Prince of Egypt Shrek spirit Madagascar coming through pain.

365
00:25:08,504 --> 00:25:10,410
Scott: I know I just never saw most of those.

366
00:25:10,631 --> 00:25:11,336
Rym: I've seen a bunch of them.

367
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:11,980
Rym: They're all okay.

368
00:25:12,726 --> 00:25:17,727
Rym: the ones I've seen Comfort panda was probably the best of the ones that I've seen here.

369
00:25:19,191 --> 00:25:20,756
Rym: Never actually shot saw Shrek.

370
00:25:20,796 --> 00:25:23,364
Rym: nor did I have any interest in seeing Shrek at any point?

371
00:25:23,925 --> 00:25:28,132
Scott: I think I've actually seen Zero Dream.

372
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:29,839
Rym: you didn't even see how to train your dragon.

373
00:25:29,879 --> 00:25:31,004
Rym: That's actually legit good.

374
00:25:31,506 --> 00:25:32,330
Scott: I've seen the trailer.

375
00:25:33,013 --> 00:25:41,530
Scott: It's a huge watch at some points that because there was a time when I went to the movies and it was the trail There was all the trailer was always how to train your dragon or how to train your dragon two or three.

376
00:25:42,396 --> 00:25:44,069
Rym: It's actually pretty good Like it's a good movie.

377
00:25:44,391 --> 00:25:53,950
Rym: But Kipo is a television show like an animated TV show on Netflix obviously aimed at kids an adventure time Kind of world like post-apocalypse.

378
00:25:54,391 --> 00:25:55,614
Rym: There's mutants everywhere.

379
00:25:55,875 --> 00:25:58,341
Rym: humans live in basically like vaults underground.

380
00:25:58,662 --> 00:26:01,570
Rym: a girl gets trapped outside of her vault and has to find her way back.

381
00:26:01,611 --> 00:26:03,370
Rym: Oh Hmm.

382
00:26:04,152 --> 00:26:04,955
Scott: Well fallout.

383
00:26:05,296 --> 00:26:07,522
Rym: Yeah, but one goes on one hand.

384
00:26:07,542 --> 00:26:14,710
Rym: It's much more light-hearted than those things and to go for leave with Yeah, but on the other hand, it's actually a lot dark light.

385
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:22,470
Rym: It looks a lot less dark than it is and it's a very dangerous show where the characters almost get literally killed on a regular basis.

386
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:26,590
Rym: But if I had to say anything about it It's actually a pretty solid kid show.

387
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:33,930
Rym: like if you haven't seen Shira or by all means watch Shira first or Steven Universe or Adventure time or any of those top tier shows.

388
00:26:34,432 --> 00:26:39,750
Rym: But if you've watched all those shows and you're just looking for something to watch like over dinner Kipo is not bad.

389
00:26:39,871 --> 00:26:41,530
Rym: It's funny enough to just kind of keep going.

390
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,172
Rym: it's Interesting.

391
00:26:44,373 --> 00:26:50,850
Rym: It's a diverse cast and I think I like the meta plot that's starting to evolve to a degree.

392
00:26:52,131 --> 00:26:54,406
Scott: Adventure time on HBO's coming sooner.

393
00:26:54,667 --> 00:26:58,530
Rym: Ah, yeah The first one is gonna be the short about BMO going into space with that rabbit girl.

394
00:26:58,792 --> 00:27:00,545
Scott: Yeah, give me that pump that right in my veins.

395
00:27:00,646 --> 00:27:09,253
Rym: Yeah, I'm Adventure time even though the end of the show was perfect like oh they just went on living their lives good like that that bit At the end was perfect.

396
00:27:10,016 --> 00:27:14,150
Rym: I am glad that there's gonna be more adventure time because I got a whole pile of Adventure Time comics.

397
00:27:14,291 --> 00:27:28,350
Rym: Yeah, so Adventure Time and pony comics are both still like a plus things but anyway things Of the day, so this is a real simple troll video.

398
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:41,647
Rym: It's about seven minutes long, but it explains what a quartermaster does on a pirate ship and you might think that sounds boring and To a degree it is born.

399
00:27:41,707 --> 00:27:44,640
Scott: Oh, you mean pirate ship specifically not regular Navy ship.

400
00:27:45,081 --> 00:27:50,259
Rym: Well, they basically do the same job like quartermaster is quartermaster no matter where you go?

401
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:53,148
Scott: Yeah, but you know, I figure pirates a little less organized.

402
00:27:53,269 --> 00:27:55,536
Rym: I mean you've played the game quartermaster general.

403
00:27:55,556 --> 00:27:56,599
Rym: I have.

404
00:27:56,659 --> 00:27:56,780
Scott: yeah.

405
00:27:57,362 --> 00:28:03,560
Rym: So what did the quartermaster do of a pirate crew and how important were they compared to the captain?

406
00:28:04,321 --> 00:28:07,378
Rym: They were probably more important than the captain even though they got paid less.

407
00:28:09,142 --> 00:28:11,360
Scott: But this is what they weren't in charge right, you know?

408
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,459
Scott: The captain can still tell the quartermaster what to do.

409
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:18,680
Rym: Yep to a point but the crew could overturn could vote to shut down the captain depending on how the pirate crew was set up.

410
00:28:18,944 --> 00:28:21,543
Scott: It's called mutiny Pirates.

411
00:28:21,563 --> 00:28:22,406
Scott: you're talking about pirates.

412
00:28:22,426 --> 00:28:23,349
Scott: You're not talking about navies.

413
00:28:23,529 --> 00:28:26,620
Rym: Yeah, not talking about navies in this case, but this video is pretty good.

414
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,944
Rym: It's just in seven minutes.

415
00:28:28,346 --> 00:28:35,430
Rym: It actually explains pretty succinctly and with a lot of Not subtle humor but dry humor that you might like.

416
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:38,680
Rym: you'll laugh at jokes a minute after they happen in this video.

417
00:28:39,241 --> 00:28:45,198
Rym: But it's a very very good explanation of what a quartermaster is and I found it fascinating.

418
00:28:45,218 --> 00:28:45,860
Rym: I hope you do too.

419
00:28:46,945 --> 00:28:51,735
Scott: okay, so Traveling around the world is kind of hard to do right now even still

420
00:28:52,017 --> 00:29:05,279
Rym: still weird Like I was looking at Google photos the other day looking for a picture from a packs of a board game We played and I scrolled past like it's weird to think that not that long ago I was like flying around in Asia and seems like I've been in my apartment for the last thousand years

421
00:29:05,941 --> 00:29:06,744
Scott: Right, but you know what?

422
00:29:06,805 --> 00:29:08,272
Scott: The good thing is you look at your window.

423
00:29:08,633 --> 00:29:09,477
Scott: You see any airplanes?

424
00:29:09,658 --> 00:29:13,076
Rym: No What does it smell like in New York City right now?

425
00:29:13,116 --> 00:29:17,337
Rym: It smells like Not New York City, it just smells like flowers and trees.

426
00:29:17,418 --> 00:29:19,864
Scott: it's weird Like tweeting like crazy.

427
00:29:20,005 --> 00:29:21,409
Rym: Oh my god, the birds are so loud.

428
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:22,934
Rym: I'm not saying it's a problem, but they're.

429
00:29:23,075 --> 00:29:24,299
Rym: they're notably loud.

430
00:29:25,045 --> 00:29:35,639
Scott: Anyway, the point is People including, you know us May have traveled to you know, the Japan land with the home of all nerdery.

431
00:29:35,659 --> 00:29:40,531
Scott: Yeah You know soon But that didn't happen.

432
00:29:40,874 --> 00:29:43,779
Scott: Yep This is not gonna happen for quite a while.

433
00:29:44,845 --> 00:29:53,428
Scott: so One of the key things pretty much any nerd wants to do when they go to Japan at least nowadays Is go to that there Ghibli Museum.

434
00:29:53,488 --> 00:29:54,150
Rym: It's amazing.

435
00:29:54,311 --> 00:30:00,051
Scott: I've been to it, which is a very Hallowed nerdy place because it's so secret, right?

436
00:30:00,111 --> 00:30:02,160
Scott: It's like you don't see too many photos of it, right?

437
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,369
Scott: Even right you see some photos the outside.

438
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:06,860
Rym: Yep, like when you go they show you a short.

439
00:30:07,243 --> 00:30:09,320
Rym: The shorts generally like aren't available anywhere else.

440
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:15,795
Scott: Animations that Animations that they show there that are randomly selected and not available to watch anywhere.

441
00:30:15,815 --> 00:30:16,557
Scott: They're not on DVD.

442
00:30:16,638 --> 00:30:17,280
Scott: They're not streaming.

443
00:30:17,381 --> 00:30:19,191
Scott: You can't record them in there, right?

444
00:30:19,251 --> 00:30:20,739
Scott: You can't watch, you know, there's nowhere to get them.

445
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,680
Scott: But like we show them in that one room, you can't pirate that.

446
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,020
Rym: Yeah, and that room is amazing.

447
00:30:25,282 --> 00:30:39,060
Rym: But think about how like you go to Disney and like there's this experience The Ghibli Museum is like that except the experience is actually aimed at the kids in a very like Visceral and direct way like there'll be a little hole near the floor that an adult might not even notice.

448
00:30:39,401 --> 00:30:50,271
Rym: But a kid who's walking along would not only see it but might just crawl into it and disappear and there's stuff in there anyway Because the Ghibli Museum is closed.

449
00:30:50,793 --> 00:30:52,340
Scott: You can't even go there if you wanted to.

450
00:30:53,403 --> 00:30:58,671
Scott: But they still feel like hey We need to share the magic of the Ghibli Museum with the world.

451
00:30:59,394 --> 00:31:00,779
Scott: They opened up a YouTube channel.

452
00:31:00,879 --> 00:31:02,579
Rym: Oh, whoa This is like a week old.

453
00:31:03,503 --> 00:31:06,880
Rym: Yeah Why are there ten dislikes on this video?

454
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:10,439
Scott: My thing of the days are high quality, not like your garbage thing of the days.

455
00:31:11,882 --> 00:31:21,999
Scott: The Ghibli Museum has an official YouTube channel where they're uploading official videos Showing you trying to give you some experience of their museum because no one can go there.

456
00:31:23,921 --> 00:31:26,570
Scott: How would you miss this something that you would you know there.

457
00:31:26,711 --> 00:31:30,505
Scott: even if it was open and the tickets weren't sold out and you Didn't have to pre-order them.

458
00:31:31,028 --> 00:31:33,299
Scott: Most people on earth could never go there.

459
00:31:34,161 --> 00:31:35,287
Scott: Now you can go on YouTube.

460
00:31:35,568 --> 00:31:38,060
Scott: That's a huge huge advancement.

461
00:31:39,642 --> 00:31:41,993
Scott: Can't miss this incredible a-plus thing of the day.

462
00:31:42,013 --> 00:31:42,294
Scott: Yep.

463
00:31:42,636 --> 00:31:43,540
Scott: This is pretty good stuff.

464
00:31:44,363 --> 00:31:46,049
Scott: I'm also very curious right?

465
00:31:46,209 --> 00:31:52,380
Scott: you know Studio Ghibli is still mostly about Miyazaki right and he's a cranky old man.

466
00:31:53,782 --> 00:31:55,489
Scott: How does he feel about this museum?

467
00:31:55,549 --> 00:31:58,240
Scott: that seems very un-cranky and very un-old man?

468
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:03,220
Rym: He doesn't seem to be cranky and old man-y about like getting kids to experience things.

469
00:32:03,889 --> 00:32:04,982
Scott: Yeah, I don't know But it's like.

470
00:32:05,062 --> 00:32:07,731
Scott: I just wonder how he feels about the museum.

471
00:32:07,931 --> 00:32:10,058
Scott: is there like an interview with him about the museum?

472
00:32:10,078 --> 00:32:16,319
Scott: because I've seen Him a lot of interviews with him and like documentaries and him talking, but he's always talking about animation and things like that.

473
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:16,781
Scott: He's not.

474
00:32:16,862 --> 00:32:24,600
Scott: I haven't seen him talk about the museum specifically like why he made it What he thinks about it, and I'm curious if I could ask him something.

475
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:27,659
Scott: That's what I'd ask him about because everything else to ask him has already been asked right why?

476
00:32:28,681 --> 00:32:32,440
Rym: Yep, I mean the only thing I know is that he did design the entire thing himself.

477
00:32:33,162 --> 00:32:33,706
Scott: Yeah, I mean he.

478
00:32:33,787 --> 00:32:35,440
Scott: obviously he's approves of it right.

479
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,204
Scott: He's not gonna be like.

480
00:32:36,264 --> 00:32:38,314
Scott: I hated that museum if they did that to make money.

481
00:32:38,354 --> 00:32:38,595
Scott: I didn't.

482
00:32:38,675 --> 00:32:39,459
Scott: I'm not a fan of it.

483
00:32:40,184 --> 00:32:40,849
Scott: Yeah, obviously.

484
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:42,360
Scott: Yeah, it's not that he's gonna say.

485
00:32:43,883 --> 00:32:45,251
Scott: If that was what he was gonna say it wouldn't.

486
00:32:45,272 --> 00:32:51,244
Rym: the Ghibli museum was a mistake In a moment.

487
00:32:51,284 --> 00:32:52,127
Rym: we can't go anywhere.

488
00:32:52,147 --> 00:32:54,015
Rym: no conventions for the foreseeable future.

489
00:32:54,035 --> 00:33:07,643
Scott: if there is an online Convention that you think will not fail because I'm already seeing some failing Spectacularly and and is a good convention that is you know stands on the right side of history Yeah, we're not.

490
00:33:07,703 --> 00:33:09,388
Scott: we're not going to know garbo.

491
00:33:09,709 --> 00:33:10,933
Scott: You know white dude convention.

492
00:33:10,953 --> 00:33:13,380
Scott: Yeah, if it's even if it's only digital, right?

493
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:21,127
Scott: Yeah, and we're white dudes, so you know if we're if we're gonna be the white dudes at the online convention We can't be the only ones.

494
00:33:21,188 --> 00:33:26,640
Rym: the one I'm definitely gonna go to as an attendee Obviously not as a lecturer or anything.

495
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,726
Rym: But game devs of color is gonna be online.

496
00:33:28,766 --> 00:33:33,220
Rym: the expo and I the people who are setting that up are a plus people.

497
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,145
Rym: I'm really good.

498
00:33:34,165 --> 00:33:35,190
Scott: game devs of color.

499
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:36,697
Scott: I just found out has a twitch channel.

500
00:33:36,757 --> 00:33:37,280
Scott: I didn't I don't know.

501
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:41,012
Scott: I didn't know about that Until recently, but I'm on.

502
00:33:41,112 --> 00:33:41,755
Scott: I got that now.

503
00:33:41,776 --> 00:33:46,832
Rym: Yep So yeah, you want us to appear in one of those conventions.

504
00:33:46,873 --> 00:33:48,117
Rym: Maybe you run one or something.

505
00:33:48,498 --> 00:33:48,940
Rym: Let us know.

506
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:52,190
Rym: I mean we can redo panels we've done.

507
00:33:52,251 --> 00:33:54,939
Rym: if you're a fan of us, you know kind of the kinds of panels we do.

508
00:33:56,162 --> 00:34:06,406
Rym: We're also very happy to do the ideas that Places like packs have never really given us the chance to try are more out there or more angry or more weird Content.

509
00:34:06,486 --> 00:34:07,919
Rym: like we got a bunch of stuff.

510
00:34:08,402 --> 00:34:12,540
Rym: Eventually, we might just start making those panels on our own and just videoing them and putting them on YouTube.

511
00:34:13,422 --> 00:34:14,547
Scott: Also our panels.

512
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:16,719
Scott: everything we do is creative comments license.

513
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:21,420
Scott: So even if you were the worst convention imaginable you could go to the YouTube channel.

514
00:34:21,902 --> 00:34:26,577
Scott: You could take our panel that we've already done on YouTube and just show it at your convention.

515
00:34:26,757 --> 00:34:30,018
Scott: digital convention Yeah, and there's nothing we could do to stop you.

516
00:34:30,822 --> 00:34:33,893
Scott: But if you're shitty and you did that and we found out we will denounce you.

517
00:34:33,914 --> 00:34:34,395
Scott: Yep.

518
00:34:34,496 --> 00:34:35,719
Rym: It's Creative Commons attribution.

519
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:36,684
Rym: You have to say who we are.

520
00:34:36,724 --> 00:34:38,049
Rym: You can't like overdub.

521
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:40,639
Rym: I'm Rym and I'm Scott with two different names.

522
00:34:41,262 --> 00:34:45,496
Scott: Yes, but yeah, well, we'll denounce you if you're bad, but you can do it if you're good.

523
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:53,742
Rym: Yeah The old the convention that I know did that but it was a DVD because there's just an ancient time was of all places Anime Boston.

524
00:34:53,762 --> 00:34:57,371
Scott: No, that wasn't them going to our YouTube and showing.

525
00:34:57,451 --> 00:35:06,796
Rym: I said they use the DVD because the YouTube thing wasn't necessary but they only did it because we had panels scheduled at both anime Boston and at what if we made?

526
00:35:07,017 --> 00:35:10,987
Scott: what if we made a Convention panels track out of?

527
00:35:11,548 --> 00:35:12,632
Scott: we don't invite anyone.

528
00:35:13,033 --> 00:35:15,420
Scott: We just take YouTube videos.

529
00:35:16,801 --> 00:35:22,340
Rym: That is actually one of the things I proposed to Otakon long ago before they kicked us off the staff.

530
00:35:22,742 --> 00:35:24,049
Scott: we go to discord right.

531
00:35:24,069 --> 00:35:29,799
Scott: we open up a discord chat and we Show YouTube videos of panels that we have selected.

532
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:36,540
Scott: Convention one after the other with breaks in between breaks in between Q&A color commentary, right?

533
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,611
Scott: We just talk in between about what we just watched.

534
00:35:38,631 --> 00:35:41,853
Scott: We call it meta meta con For like a few hours.

535
00:35:41,914 --> 00:35:44,939
Rym: Yeah Not a terrible idea

536
00:35:46,264 --> 00:35:46,365
Scott: Mmm,

537
00:35:46,608 --> 00:35:55,342
Rym: but anyway, yeah The tale of Hanzo tale of Genji where hopefully I'll start reading it again now that I can just bike somewhere and sit under a Tree for a while,

538
00:35:55,704 --> 00:35:59,599
Scott: but maybe I'll see if I can successfully read while biking in one place.

539
00:36:00,322 --> 00:36:04,718
Rym: I I do read while I'm biking on the shitty exercise bike, but I cannot read while I'm running.

540
00:36:04,819 --> 00:36:06,675
Scott: so Yeah, yeah, obviously.

541
00:36:07,861 --> 00:36:09,712
Rym: So we watch some more anime.

542
00:36:09,732 --> 00:36:11,120
Rym: We're gonna talk about this anime now.

543
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:14,570
Rym: I want to preface this by saying something very important goes to the show.

544
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:18,818
Rym: standalone complex first and second gig are some of our favorite anime ever.

545
00:36:20,301 --> 00:36:23,351
Rym: like it's a class anime through the kind of show.

546
00:36:23,371 --> 00:36:30,038
Scott: so goes to the show the original movie also a Plus anime and the original manga a plus.

547
00:36:30,078 --> 00:36:30,259
Scott: Yep

548
00:36:30,741 --> 00:36:48,747
Rym: But like standalone complex is the kind of thing where like when I was doing a little bit of research before we did this show I pulled up a clip last night of a random scene from second gig and It was real hard to not just start watching all of second gig again Mm-hmm, so I'd gotten excited

549
00:36:48,767 --> 00:36:48,787
Scott: a

550
00:36:49,368 --> 00:36:53,580
Rym: while ago when I found out that there was gonna be more ghost in the shell standalone complex.

551
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,387
Rym: A little bit of a hide.

552
00:36:54,407 --> 00:36:55,960
Rym: even Homer Simpson with the program.

553
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:59,470
Scott: Yeah, I didn't finish watching all of the arise.

554
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:01,356
Rym: No one did cuz it was boring.

555
00:37:01,376 --> 00:37:02,440
Rym: It wasn't going anywhere.

556
00:37:03,364 --> 00:37:05,000
Scott: I think we only watched one episode.

557
00:37:05,401 --> 00:37:08,951
Rym: Watch a bunch more and I kept stopping.

558
00:37:08,991 --> 00:37:12,100
Rym: cuz I kept forgetting to watch more cuz it didn't leave any impression on me.

559
00:37:12,241 --> 00:37:12,564
Rym: I watched.

560
00:37:12,604 --> 00:37:14,320
Scott: I think we watched one episode in the theater.

561
00:37:14,501 --> 00:37:19,340
Scott: Yeah, we did and and then I don't think I've watched it anymore since even though it seems to all be on Netflix.

562
00:37:19,581 --> 00:37:23,380
Rym: So I've watched all of it and I've seen some of the episodes more than once.

563
00:37:23,922 --> 00:37:26,835
Rym: I am at a loss to remember enough to even tell you what happened in it.

564
00:37:26,875 --> 00:37:28,020
Rym: That is how forgettable it was.

565
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:29,548
Scott: I can't remember anything.

566
00:37:29,669 --> 00:37:31,600
Rym: standalone complex was the good one.

567
00:37:31,721 --> 00:37:40,820
Rym: So I got excited that there's gonna be more standalone complex But because it was announced like a while ago like a long time ago years ago, but then I forgot about it.

568
00:37:41,001 --> 00:37:42,326
Rym: I just forgot that was the thing.

569
00:37:42,346 --> 00:37:45,399
Rym: I just slipped my mind didn't think about it.

570
00:37:45,941 --> 00:37:52,270
Rym: And then one day Anna Twitter was making fun of a naked backwards flipping guy And they said something ghost in the shell.

571
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:57,931
Rym: and then I discovered that not only had it come out But it's bad or at least people were saying it was bad.

572
00:37:58,433 --> 00:38:00,720
Scott: Everyone said ghost is a new ghost in the shell.

573
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:01,783
Scott: It's all CG.

574
00:38:02,124 --> 00:38:04,130
Scott: It's on Netflix and it's.

575
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:11,536
Scott: they were saying it's way way bad and I was like, oh, okay I guess I'll avoid that then because you know, there hasn't been.

576
00:38:11,556 --> 00:38:14,599
Scott: you know Ghost in the shell isn't something where it's guaranteed to be good.

577
00:38:14,961 --> 00:38:16,828
Rym: I mean the majority of the ghost in the shell.

578
00:38:16,869 --> 00:38:19,680
Rym: content that exists in the universe is not great.

579
00:38:20,387 --> 00:38:23,108
Scott: If you look at all of it It's like it's pretty much.

580
00:38:23,168 --> 00:38:28,269
Scott: It's like the original movie the original manga Get sack one get sack two innocence.

581
00:38:28,309 --> 00:38:28,730
Scott: the movie.

582
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:30,577
Rym: I like innocence, but it's not.

583
00:38:30,737 --> 00:38:31,640
Rym: it's got problems Like.

584
00:38:31,681 --> 00:38:34,089
Rym: it's not a great movie, but I really.

585
00:38:34,531 --> 00:38:39,379
Scott: and then there's man-machine interface, which would come next I guess in the rankings and that's even more.

586
00:38:41,041 --> 00:38:51,200
Rym: But I figured reviewing this would be good one because I want to give it a chance to see if The story the plot like anything can get through the fact that it looks worse than PUBG, right?

587
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,571
Scott: It's like what we've been every I sort of realize.

588
00:38:53,591 --> 00:38:55,680
Scott: it's like hey all the only things we talked about in GeekNights.

589
00:38:55,740 --> 00:39:06,250
Scott: So things we watch or play or whatever and it's always stuff that we've you know We've judged it beforehand and it's usually gonna be good has a good chance of being good before we go for it.

590
00:39:07,981 --> 00:39:10,188
Scott: So it's pretty rare that we watch something that's bad.

591
00:39:10,228 --> 00:39:16,487
Scott: I said, you know what everyone says this is bad, but you know, let's Write a verify.

592
00:39:16,507 --> 00:39:23,920
Scott: Yeah and be even if it turns out that it's bad It's like well we can at least do a GeekNights on something that's bad and not always something that's good.

593
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:31,320
Rym: We made a pact that we would watch two episodes and no more and if either one of us felt the urge to watch the Third episode we would tell the other one advance.

594
00:39:31,782 --> 00:39:37,386
Rym: I note that I did not at any point tell you to watch episode 3 and I did not receive a message from you telling me To watch episode 3.

595
00:39:37,386 --> 00:39:37,748
Scott: Well, I didn't.

596
00:39:37,808 --> 00:39:39,196
Scott: I didn't remember it till today.

597
00:39:39,296 --> 00:39:51,040
Scott: So I watched The first episode earlier today and the second one like just before the show, yep, so Even if I wanted to watch 3 I didn't have time.

598
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,488
Rym: So on one hand the animation like it just did.

599
00:39:53,969 --> 00:39:58,383
Rym: this show looks like a kind say a cutscene from a video game But it's worse than that.

600
00:39:58,744 --> 00:40:02,759
Rym: It looks like a cutscene from one generation ago video game.

601
00:40:04,061 --> 00:40:08,940
Scott: Yeah, I think the biggest problem in the animation is that it's not low quality, right?

602
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,873
Scott: It's like you can take certain stills and say wow, look at that.

603
00:40:11,893 --> 00:40:12,536
Scott: It's pretty good CG.

604
00:40:12,556 --> 00:40:26,403
Scott: Yeah, okay All right, it's that the way the characters move Combined with the cel shading on the characters Contrasted with this extremely highly detailed Background.

605
00:40:26,504 --> 00:40:30,154
Rym: Oh my god, like an Aramaki's office the wooden door has the work.

606
00:40:30,195 --> 00:40:33,883
Scott: The worst part is Aramaki's on that Exquisite door.

607
00:40:33,963 --> 00:40:35,969
Rym: that door looks photorealistic.

608
00:40:36,009 --> 00:40:41,002
Scott: and then there's this that was the scene where I noticed the CG being the worst was Aramaki's Standing around.

609
00:40:41,042 --> 00:40:45,476
Rym: Yep, and then both Aramaki looks like weird like Aramaki looks worse than any other character.

610
00:40:45,496 --> 00:40:46,720
Scott: Oh, yeah, he's bad.

611
00:40:47,343 --> 00:40:48,729
Rym: He's the weirdest hairs.

612
00:40:48,769 --> 00:40:54,479
Rym: weird like he's outlined wrong and like yeah It's almost like there's a different shader on him from everyone else in the show.

613
00:40:55,662 --> 00:41:08,519
Scott: anyway, the other thing is that unlike say a b-star which has minimal action scenes Right that are done in a in a different kind of way as to like not actually show most of the action explicitly.

614
00:41:08,539 --> 00:41:19,940
Scott: Yeah, right Ghost, you know this ghost in the shell at least focuses more on action scenes Even though ghost in the shell usually is mostly top heads with like one action scene.

615
00:41:20,422 --> 00:41:22,349
Scott: This focuses a lot on action scenes.

616
00:41:22,409 --> 00:41:30,580
Scott: Yeah, calm, you know military paramilitary combat and those parts are are weird too, but the They're weird for a bunch of reasons.

617
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:34,555
Rym: Like I got I had a lot to say about this show the more it is it so that?

618
00:41:34,636 --> 00:41:50,453
Scott: but the point is the contrast With the the Celsius the moving parts against the non moving background makes it look Yeah way it ends up being one of the weird CGs and not one of the good CGs like honestly I'd like say a dragon prince or a b-star.

619
00:41:50,473 --> 00:41:55,260
Rym: Well, like dragon dragon prince I was gonna bring up myself too because dragon prince has some awkward animation.

620
00:41:55,541 --> 00:42:00,898
Rym: But the characters the story everything else made it very easy for me to just see past that and enjoy the show.

621
00:42:01,339 --> 00:42:03,785
Rym: this There's nothing to see like.

622
00:42:04,106 --> 00:42:07,255
Rym: the characters don't even feel like the ghost in the shell characters.

623
00:42:07,496 --> 00:42:12,525
Rym: The dialogue is stilted and Like really prosaic.

624
00:42:12,626 --> 00:42:16,575
Rym: like the like the characters don't say anything interesting to each other really ever.

625
00:42:17,217 --> 00:42:24,839
Rym: the setting is vague Unrealistic and also almost a betrayal of like the arc of ghost in the shell up to this point.

626
00:42:25,282 --> 00:42:30,390
Rym: Like you look at where standalone complex second gig ended This show is almost like a reversion like they step back into.

627
00:42:30,711 --> 00:42:32,919
Rym: well section 9 got disbanded again.

628
00:42:32,939 --> 00:42:35,189
Rym: now We're gonna reform it again.

629
00:42:35,631 --> 00:42:40,920
Rym: vague political plot again But it's a slightly different political plot that has way less nuance.

630
00:42:42,163 --> 00:42:43,511
Scott: Yeah, I think so plot wise right?

631
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,023
Scott: It's something about.

632
00:42:46,164 --> 00:42:54,071
Scott: the world is now in perpetual war and there's one percenters But there's an evil good one percenter whose funding.

633
00:42:54,232 --> 00:42:55,135
Rym: it's Mad Max world.

634
00:42:55,175 --> 00:42:58,006
Rym: now because of economic warfare You get this.

635
00:42:58,388 --> 00:43:03,085
Rym: the show starts with just this long Narration of right.

636
00:43:03,105 --> 00:43:04,531
Rym: here is the state of the world.

637
00:43:04,912 --> 00:43:07,100
Rym: It doesn't even like that's in the shell anymore.

638
00:43:07,462 --> 00:43:08,409
Scott: I think that's part of the.

639
00:43:08,651 --> 00:43:18,369
Scott: that's a huge part of the problem because Ghost in the shell has never like doesn't usually explicitly Tell you all how like the world is.

640
00:43:18,409 --> 00:43:20,900
Rym: Yeah, it's all incidental storytelling like they don't tell you.

641
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:24,698
Rym: Oh section 9 does this because section 8 does this and section 7 does this.

642
00:43:24,738 --> 00:43:39,319
Rym: and so, you know The kind of stuff that nerds love that I hate that like that World building for no purpose other than world building goes in the shell will just be like you run into section public security section 6 Because reasons and they're not their deal is not fully explained because it doesn't matter right

643
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:39,440
Scott: there.

644
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:43,960
Scott: Don't explain how the world is structured or how the economy is doing or the any of the big picture, right?

645
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,525
Scott: You're seeing and ghost in the shell.

646
00:43:45,545 --> 00:43:54,593
Scott: You're all you're seeing, you know section 9 plays this small Role in this on these, you know, the what's you know their mission?

647
00:43:54,633 --> 00:43:55,717
Scott: Yeah, right that they're odd.

648
00:43:55,737 --> 00:43:57,600
Rym: They're basically the terrorist.

649
00:43:58,662 --> 00:44:00,252
Scott: Yeah, there's a terrorist here doing this.

650
00:44:00,614 --> 00:44:01,499
Scott: You got to stop them.

651
00:44:01,881 --> 00:44:08,443
Scott: It's obviously in the interest of whoever's commanding them and you're it's always a mystery who's commanding them that the Surroundings of like.

652
00:44:08,805 --> 00:44:09,990
Scott: why is this guy doing this?

653
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:10,874
Scott: Why are they bad?

654
00:44:10,934 --> 00:44:11,417
Scott: Why did they?

655
00:44:11,678 --> 00:44:12,140
Scott: why did it go?

656
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:16,092
Scott: Why did you know section 9's bosses want this done?

657
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:18,460
Scott: Right, you know the opposition they meet.

658
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:21,931
Scott: What are their motivations who are their bosses and what is their bigger picture?

659
00:44:22,332 --> 00:44:24,158
Scott: You don't see any of that directly.

660
00:44:24,258 --> 00:44:27,631
Scott: It's always indirect inference figuring it out.

661
00:44:27,671 --> 00:44:28,939
Scott: Maybe you never find out at all.

662
00:44:29,342 --> 00:44:31,475
Scott: That's how ghost in the shell is always point of view

663
00:44:31,556 --> 00:44:42,592
Rym: of soldiers I would almost say professionals but professionals in the master Keaton way who have basically given up any semblance of a life to Live this life, but you see it from their perspective of you got your marching orders.

664
00:44:42,933 --> 00:44:44,518
Rym: Go do the thing, right?

665
00:44:44,999 --> 00:44:54,259
Scott: And Here by explicitly in some detail not perfect detail But in some detail like explaining the state the world is in and focusing on that.

666
00:44:55,321 --> 00:44:56,345
Scott: It's sort of like me.

667
00:44:56,926 --> 00:45:02,652
Rym: it's not like ruins that whole aspect and it keeps like reminding you like Oh, well, the setting is like this.

668
00:45:02,732 --> 00:45:03,840
Rym: for these reasons, right?

669
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:04,181
Rym: You know what?

670
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:12,251
Rym: It feels like watching this feels like reading the Wikipedia page about this show Right, like there's no watching goes.

671
00:45:12,352 --> 00:45:14,220
Rym: Michelle PD is the same, right?

672
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:19,100
Scott: So when I watch a ghost in the shell, the reason I like it is because a you care about the characters, right?

673
00:45:20,141 --> 00:45:22,920
Scott: Be careful what the characters are doing, right?

674
00:45:23,944 --> 00:45:28,920
Scott: See there's some Usually something going on that's always asking.

675
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:38,715
Scott: It's constantly asking you all sort of like transhumanist cyberpunk kind of questions Right and scenarios and morals right along right?

676
00:45:38,756 --> 00:45:44,440
Scott: So it's like, okay the you know They got orders to go stop this hacking guy, but what's that hacking guy about?

677
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:52,717
Scott: Oh, he's doing this thing and that guy is you know, there's some moral Cyber moral related to what that guy's up to.

678
00:45:52,757 --> 00:45:53,340
Scott: that they're after.

679
00:45:53,461 --> 00:45:56,280
Rym: Yeah, and I this one's gonna have that same plot.

680
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,860
Rym: It feels like from like what I read of spoilers after I watched the first two episodes.

681
00:46:00,021 --> 00:46:01,147
Rym: But it just.

682
00:46:01,771 --> 00:46:10,120
Rym: it feels like someone Barfing out a list of spoilers or like a comic book that someone would read literally just to find out what happened to spider-man.

683
00:46:10,201 --> 00:46:11,793
Rym: But they don't care about the artistry of it.

684
00:46:12,458 --> 00:46:12,579
Scott: Yeah.

685
00:46:12,921 --> 00:46:27,703
Scott: So another thing all right is a ghost in the shell and most of its iterations that I can think of has a somewhat Consistent mood to it where it's sort of like dark eerie Cyberpunk II

686
00:46:27,823 --> 00:46:35,527
Rym: often very zoomed in action scenes tend to be very sharp and punctuating Surrounded by long silences and tension.

687
00:46:35,548 --> 00:46:38,896
Rym: This one's just like what like literally watching a PUBG match.

688
00:46:38,916 --> 00:46:40,360
Scott: very very surreal.

689
00:46:40,921 --> 00:46:45,855
Scott: Yeah, I think about the episode where there's like a brain like that.

690
00:46:45,875 --> 00:46:50,899
Rym: They find that a bizarre that the Yeah, they like jack into it to see what's going on in there.

691
00:46:51,522 --> 00:46:52,807
Scott: And it's like a weird kind of.

692
00:46:52,947 --> 00:46:59,370
Rym: you know the one where it gets into the majors past with her hallucinations Right exactly the same kind of deals right?

693
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:04,047
Scott: or you know the one where was like Batou goes to a dojo or something.

694
00:47:04,548 --> 00:47:15,256
Rym: the best my favorite are monkey with the wine cellar in all of standalone Complex is still the one where you find out where Saito the sniper like how he joined the major Mm-hmm.

695
00:47:16,942 --> 00:47:23,474
Scott: The point is is you get those are a character episodes Yeah, which you're not getting anything out of here B.

696
00:47:23,695 --> 00:47:24,520
Rym: They actually show it.

697
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:28,728
Scott: They don't just tell you right But they have this this mood to them right.

698
00:47:28,808 --> 00:47:34,202
Scott: all of ghost in the shell has this same mood and and ghost Michelle was a 2045.

699
00:47:34,202 --> 00:47:40,360
Scott: Right that mood is just completely obliterated in the opener with its weird-ass song.

700
00:47:40,842 --> 00:47:45,920
Rym: Oh my god no right I was almost okay with that opener because it's an okay song.

701
00:47:46,222 --> 00:47:48,400
Scott: It just does not fit ghost in the shell.

702
00:47:48,588 --> 00:47:50,509
Rym: Yeah I could see it fitting.

703
00:47:50,629 --> 00:47:53,947
Rym: if the show were better in the sense that This is the like.

704
00:47:54,087 --> 00:48:00,599
Rym: this would be the standalone complex like third gig Where it gets into the fact that really section 9 just does what money wants it to do.

705
00:48:01,242 --> 00:48:02,205
Rym: Like you can see there.

706
00:48:02,225 --> 00:48:06,160
Rym: There's a direction you could go with that, but I don't think that's the direction the show's going.

707
00:48:06,462 --> 00:48:07,611
Rym: also, you didn't watch Westworld.

708
00:48:07,631 --> 00:48:17,392
Rym: the opening is like Almost identical to the Westworld opening, but Westworld is very like serious Like music build-up and this one is running mmm.

709
00:48:17,533 --> 00:48:19,439
Rym: This one is more like Westworld.

710
00:48:19,479 --> 00:48:19,780
Scott: you'll print.

711
00:48:21,908 --> 00:48:23,040
Scott: I don't know any other Westworld's.

712
00:48:23,902 --> 00:48:25,315
Rym: Yeah, you haven't seen the new Westworld at all.

713
00:48:26,608 --> 00:48:27,356
Scott: Have you'll printer it?

714
00:48:28,401 --> 00:48:30,225
Rym: Actually, yes, you'll they.

715
00:48:30,446 --> 00:48:35,700
Rym: there is a you hold better cameo in the new Westworld, but he died before they made the new West.

716
00:48:35,921 --> 00:48:46,216
Rym: Yeah, but the new Westworld is about the same thing as the old Westworld and at one point they go into this like warehouse Of a bunch of old like previous generation Westworld stuff and there's a yule Brenner.

717
00:48:46,236 --> 00:48:47,420
Rym: just stand in there right in the front.

718
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:49,125
Scott: Okay, I'll watch that episode.

719
00:48:49,185 --> 00:48:51,033
Rym: Yeah, you can find a clip of it on YouTube.

720
00:48:51,073 --> 00:48:54,033
Rym: search for like yule Brenner new Westworld And you'll see him there, okay?

721
00:48:55,401 --> 00:49:00,180
Rym: Yeah, but the opener reminds me of the Westworld opener and Westworld deals with a lot of these same transhumanist themes.

722
00:49:01,421 --> 00:49:04,376
Rym: But I don't think the money makes the world go round.

723
00:49:04,436 --> 00:49:13,210
Rym: song is like this Subversion of you thought the standalone complex and like section 9 we're doing these noble things But really they just do what money and government like.

724
00:49:13,552 --> 00:49:15,300
Rym: I don't feel like that subversion is there.

725
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:17,688
Rym: I don't feel like I know all of that on purpose.

726
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:21,160
Scott: all of the cyberpunk stuff has basically been removed.

727
00:49:21,642 --> 00:49:22,968
Rym: Right it is in the rest of the show.

728
00:49:22,989 --> 00:49:27,107
Rym: the rest of the show is about these post humans are trying to get rid of The regular humans and all sorts of stuff.

729
00:49:27,248 --> 00:49:32,673
Scott: Okay, maybe but regardless it's like You're just watching at least in the first two episodes.

730
00:49:32,753 --> 00:49:34,000
Scott: What is otherwise?

731
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:42,499
Scott: Just you know like a Mission Impossible Kind of deal right like team of people have to go out and do a military thing.

732
00:49:42,519 --> 00:49:42,659
Scott: alright.

733
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:44,005
Rym: So let's talk about that.

734
00:49:44,065 --> 00:49:45,993
Rym: so let's see and there's.

735
00:49:46,094 --> 00:49:50,413
Scott: no you know it's like yeah the weapons They're using it's like oh they hack someone's brain, and they have.

736
00:49:50,453 --> 00:49:56,193
Scott: there's a crazy drone with AI But there's no it that doesn't play into the moral or the plot.

737
00:49:56,233 --> 00:50:00,160
Scott: it just plays into the the action on But also the action on the screen.

738
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:06,285
Rym: Like wait I could see if the show was doing that sort of subversive Twist on Ghost in the Shell.

739
00:50:06,546 --> 00:50:19,408
Rym: and then you get these scenes were like it's heavy action like they're just mercenaries now because the plot Of episode one is they literally are just mercenaries working in like America in Palm Springs Just in a Mad Max apocalypse.

740
00:50:19,428 --> 00:50:21,334
Scott: I think here's the best way to describe it right.

741
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:27,792
Scott: so here in 2045 We see them using Tachikomas Yeah, which we also see them doing in standalone complex.

742
00:50:27,853 --> 00:50:32,491
Scott: right, but in standalone complex They're not just using the Tachikomas in battle.

743
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:34,639
Scott: There is a major plot line.

744
00:50:35,049 --> 00:50:38,148
Scott: Yeah Perhaps the most major plot line it is.

745
00:50:38,208 --> 00:50:41,819
Scott: it shows about the Tachikomas in their AI and what the deal is.

746
00:50:41,859 --> 00:50:43,665
Scott: yeah Right and the show.

747
00:50:43,685 --> 00:50:46,053
Scott: this show is not in any way about that.

748
00:50:46,555 --> 00:50:52,875
Rym: it might get that way later But if I don't think it's gonna do it in a satisfying way, but right the Tachikoma is also.

749
00:50:53,155 --> 00:51:02,660
Rym: even action scenes Would have little like things the Tachikomas did that continued to tell that story of what's up with the Tachikomas.

750
00:51:03,362 --> 00:51:06,972
Rym: Right like they would make a decision that people were surprised by.

751
00:51:06,992 --> 00:51:09,600
Rym: but then that like they wouldn't focus on that as the plot.

752
00:51:09,881 --> 00:51:14,220
Rym: But that sort of incidental storytelling would build up to the climax of the show and these transhumanist ideas.

753
00:51:14,762 --> 00:51:16,307
Rym: The show does does not feel like it's going there.

754
00:51:16,327 --> 00:51:19,258
Scott: Here the Tachikomas are literally just talking weapons.

755
00:51:19,298 --> 00:51:21,411
Scott: They're not Doing anything.

756
00:51:21,432 --> 00:51:22,520
Scott: yeah, they're not characters.

757
00:51:22,841 --> 00:51:29,220
Rym: But even if let's say this was this was all on purpose the action scenes themselves are also really badly done like the fight.

758
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,678
Rym: Choreography doesn't make any goddamn sense at all.

759
00:51:32,482 --> 00:51:39,221
Rym: Like though these cars are driving behind them shooting at them for like five minutes while they talk and yet not a single bullet even comes Near.

760
00:51:39,281 --> 00:51:43,920
Rym: anybody like it doesn't even make sense from the perspective of an action scene.

761
00:51:44,841 --> 00:51:55,900
Scott: Yeah, no not a lot of the stuff doesn't make sense, but it seems like someone just came up with scenes They wanted to see yeah Oh, we want to see the her go into the sky and grab a drone right and it's like okay.

762
00:51:56,102 --> 00:51:57,556
Scott: And then they found a way to make it happen.

763
00:51:57,819 --> 00:52:07,540
Rym: yep But the characters also don't really feel like the characters You know from ghost in the shell like they have the same voice actors and nominally the same character.

764
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:08,725
Rym: But their dialogue is bad.

765
00:52:08,765 --> 00:52:13,302
Rym: the dialogue is so like clipped and prosaic like the conversations They have.

766
00:52:13,564 --> 00:52:16,897
Rym: you could swap which character says what line and it really wouldn't matter.

767
00:52:16,938 --> 00:52:21,614
Scott: for the most part The character with the most character is actually the new guy.

768
00:52:21,634 --> 00:52:29,519
Scott: yeah clown clown right Who you know is probably just kind of like is a traitor or is gonna get killed or something something's up?

769
00:52:30,202 --> 00:52:44,619
Scott: Yeah, something's up with that new guy, but they actually even though the new guy's character is very flimsy He's basically you know guy who has some skills, but way less skills way less experience a way less discipline Yeah, and sort of silly right?

770
00:52:45,703 --> 00:52:55,737
Scott: You know likes to act up and get on a line like a. you know It's pretty stereotypical for a new guy on a team right in any sort of Team based like you know action kind of thing.

771
00:52:56,906 --> 00:53:04,020
Scott: But that paper-thin You know personality he has is more than the other characters have which is zero

772
00:53:04,281 --> 00:53:06,166
Rym: Yeah, but like the things that all their personality

773
00:53:06,186 --> 00:53:07,770
Scott: from the previous shows has been removed

774
00:53:07,911 --> 00:53:15,754
Rym: like they don't make sense like vato like acting They're actually going to drink this beer in a party when really they're on the way to a mission.

775
00:53:15,815 --> 00:53:17,882
Rym: like the dialogue didn't really make Sense.

776
00:53:17,942 --> 00:53:23,245
Rym: it felt like they were just filling time and like I have the characters talk before the fight scene But they also subverted.

777
00:53:23,285 --> 00:53:27,960
Rym: some of the characters like Toga say is now like divorced like they've just changed whole cloth.

778
00:53:28,061 --> 00:53:29,919
Rym: How some of the characters exist in the universe?

779
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:31,522
Scott: Right and it's like.

780
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:43,420
Rym: that's the kind of thing where like the whole point of that character was that he's the only one who's holding On to a normal life outside of this paramilitary life Like that was and that was across multiple seasons and both movies.

781
00:53:44,624 --> 00:53:45,900
Scott: Right and that was like a constant.

782
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:50,177
Scott: I was like a thing that made that was like made his him like have a deal.

783
00:53:50,237 --> 00:53:55,658
Scott: right is like This guy actually has like a family and a life every single other person is completely alone in the world.

784
00:53:55,718 --> 00:53:56,320
Rym: yep, right?

785
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,908
Scott: They have no family they have no friends.

786
00:53:59,249 --> 00:54:03,872
Rym: you ever see like they throw themselves into their work because there's no Right.

787
00:54:03,953 --> 00:54:04,638
Scott: no nothing right.

788
00:54:04,698 --> 00:54:06,785
Scott: Toga Has this family this wife and kid.

789
00:54:07,286 --> 00:54:09,913
Scott: right and it's like and he's involved.

790
00:54:09,933 --> 00:54:20,000
Scott: He's the only one involved who knows anyone else and He's you know also mostly human right and almost entirely human right and it sets him apart.

791
00:54:20,503 --> 00:54:29,216
Scott: But yet you still see him doing the job, and he's awesome And that's like his whole reason for being there right is to you know connect.

792
00:54:29,377 --> 00:54:30,420
Scott: You know make that connection.

793
00:54:30,641 --> 00:54:32,912
Rym: I do want to say I feel like Paz and Borma do.

794
00:54:32,932 --> 00:54:40,722
Rym: both have lives outside But they keep it secretive like it because the show really focuses on the major and Bato and like a really limited set of the Characters.

795
00:54:40,762 --> 00:54:42,310
Scott: well you see like in standalone complex.

796
00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:43,435
Scott: I just mentioned right it was.

797
00:54:43,556 --> 00:54:48,900
Scott: you know those episodes You know Bato and the dojo and you know our Maki and the wine cellar.

798
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:56,980
Scott: Yeah, right do show they have some outside connections to some people right professional people who really don't are like the major.

799
00:54:58,164 --> 00:54:59,336
Scott: Yeah, the major doesn't know anybody.

800
00:54:59,356 --> 00:54:59,518
Scott: yeah.

801
00:55:01,121 --> 00:55:04,094
Scott: But anyway the point is is that's what that character is about.

802
00:55:04,195 --> 00:55:06,805
Scott: so by removing that it's like Oh, what's togas about now?

803
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:11,985
Scott: right well the only thing he's about now is being mostly human I guess, but they don't ever bring that up.

804
00:55:12,346 --> 00:55:16,660
Scott: Yeah, they've removed all cyberpunk moral storytelling, so that doesn't matter anymore.

805
00:55:16,768 --> 00:55:16,856
Rym: Yeah.

806
00:55:17,041 --> 00:55:28,060
Rym: But then what really rankled me that pushed me over the line of not caring about the show was when The plot in the second episode it gets revealed that Aramaki's reforming section 9 that is literally how it's like second gig starts.

807
00:55:28,421 --> 00:55:33,641
Rym: That's how every ghost in the shell starts either the form in section 9 or the reform in section 9.

808
00:55:33,641 --> 00:55:36,270
Scott: And it's so the way the reform is just like.

809
00:55:36,290 --> 00:55:38,298
Scott: well the prime minister wants us to reform it.

810
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:40,187
Scott: ok Yeah, we'll do it.

811
00:55:40,227 --> 00:55:40,509
Scott: Then.

812
00:55:40,629 --> 00:55:42,500
Scott: It's like you didn't have any like.

813
00:55:44,222 --> 00:55:49,946
Rym: And then they explain about how the prime minister is actually an American who's gonna Just be a puppet of American interests.

814
00:55:49,986 --> 00:55:54,442
Rym: like it says out loud the things that one don't fucking matter to a show Like this.

815
00:55:54,743 --> 00:55:57,110
Rym: and two in a good ghost in the shell.

816
00:55:57,511 --> 00:56:01,387
Rym: you figure that out if you care in the background But it doesn't if it matters.

817
00:56:01,407 --> 00:56:06,720
Rym: and but even then even if it doesn't matter if it matters You still don't need to figure it out to understand the rest of the show.

818
00:56:07,081 --> 00:56:18,494
Scott: Because a good a good ghost in the shell is the type of anime where they're you know trying to catch Like a hacker in a random neighborhood who's right and they hacked into.

819
00:56:18,554 --> 00:56:20,259
Scott: I guess I remember some ghosts in the shell.

820
00:56:20,279 --> 00:56:23,450
Scott: seems They're like hacking the garbage man or something right something like that.

821
00:56:23,831 --> 00:56:36,983
Scott: and on a TV that the garbage man is watching It says new prime minister elected first American new American Prime Minister of Japan yeah, and it cuts away because you're actually focusing on the garbage men's conversation Yeah,

822
00:56:37,023 --> 00:56:43,196
Rym: but then five episodes later that Prime Minister like suddenly It's like oh the Prime Minister cut our funding and they're like what shit.

823
00:56:43,276 --> 00:56:47,917
Scott: Oh, no Yeah, the Prime Minister like makes an announcement something something, and then that's all you see.

824
00:56:48,218 --> 00:56:48,660
Scott: right you know.

825
00:56:49,662 --> 00:56:52,400
Rym: But then the final final line was the closer.

826
00:56:53,464 --> 00:56:54,558
Rym: Why can't the show look like that?

827
00:56:55,880 --> 00:57:01,997
Scott: The closing close I did note it looks I was gonna say as bad as the opener is with its with its song that doesn't fit.

828
00:57:02,017 --> 00:57:04,170
Scott: that's not a bad song It's just a non-fitting song.

829
00:57:04,190 --> 00:57:11,450
Scott: yeah when the closer started I was like oh this closer seemed like is a completely normal closer that belongs in a ghost in the show felt like ghost in the shell closer.

830
00:57:11,775 --> 00:57:14,234
Rym: and Also, the animation looked good.

831
00:57:14,274 --> 00:57:16,261
Rym: the character designs look good Mmm.

832
00:57:16,943 --> 00:57:21,256
Scott: I mean there are parts of the animation that look good, but yeah well like but like.

833
00:57:21,276 --> 00:57:28,400
Rym: the thing that looked good in the Fight scene was that robot dog, but they set up that robot dog like oh, what's that kind of robot?

834
00:57:28,821 --> 00:57:40,164
Rym: I was that was the weirdest bad check-offs dog Yeah But they did like that scene and a different ghost in the shell would have had an appropriate amount of menace like we don't know What that box is.

835
00:57:40,404 --> 00:57:44,840
Rym: we got to worry about it and when the box does its thing it's gonna be something fucking insane.

836
00:57:45,201 --> 00:57:48,153
Rym: But it's like oh, it's just a guard dog, and how did they defeat it?

837
00:57:48,394 --> 00:57:49,398
Rym: They just shot it.

838
00:57:50,121 --> 00:57:52,068
Scott: Yeah, I mean it was strange to me.

839
00:57:52,128 --> 00:57:55,340
Scott: It's like the the power level of the characters.

840
00:57:56,145 --> 00:57:58,319
Rym: Seems it was like it was all over the place.

841
00:57:59,484 --> 00:58:09,515
Scott: It's like in you know It's like the major and the original ghost in the shell movie like ripped the tank apart right with their pants so it damaged her too.

842
00:58:09,575 --> 00:58:13,600
Scott: right, but the You know they're really fucking strong.

843
00:58:14,122 --> 00:58:18,898
Scott: So it's like even that dog and the drone that they try to make scary.

844
00:58:19,059 --> 00:58:21,758
Scott: It's like Why were those?

845
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:23,766
Scott: Scary, it's like the major.

846
00:58:23,786 --> 00:58:25,553
Scott: like should have just like like.

847
00:58:25,573 --> 00:58:28,144
Scott: oh, it's a little robot dog Whatever like.

848
00:58:28,164 --> 00:58:30,535
Rym: they could have shot it immediately, but they don't scare.

849
00:58:30,555 --> 00:58:31,720
Rym: it causes a bunch of problems.

850
00:58:31,901 --> 00:58:37,171
Rym: And then like ten minutes later in the episode or I think the next episode They just shoot it like they could have done.

851
00:58:37,332 --> 00:58:38,920
Scott: It's not scary for them at all.

852
00:58:39,041 --> 00:58:39,764
Scott: I don't know why they.

853
00:58:39,964 --> 00:58:45,266
Scott: they acted scared of it, and they tried to present it as being dangerous But it wasn't for them.

854
00:58:45,447 --> 00:58:50,914
Scott: you and the drone could have been scary, but it's like no Why did the majors hack the drone to bring it down?

855
00:58:50,954 --> 00:58:51,760
Scott: She's good enough.

856
00:58:51,941 --> 00:58:52,926
Scott: It's like they.

857
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:55,540
Rym: they lampshaded that by saying that the drone was running autonomous.

858
00:58:56,727 --> 00:58:58,938
Scott: Sure It was still strange.

859
00:58:59,749 --> 00:59:01,944
Rym: Yeah It's just the show also.

860
00:59:01,964 --> 00:59:03,850
Scott: that also gives you another point.

861
00:59:03,891 --> 00:59:04,834
Scott: right is like all right.

862
00:59:04,854 --> 00:59:08,585
Scott: so the major does some crazy action scene stuff And gets up there to the drone.

863
00:59:08,866 --> 00:59:11,093
Scott: right okay, the drone does not have any networking.

864
00:59:11,153 --> 00:59:12,477
Scott: It's running autonomously.

865
00:59:12,617 --> 00:59:13,480
Scott: right something like that.

866
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:14,688
Rym: Yeah, instead of complex.

867
00:59:14,748 --> 00:59:16,440
Scott: She would like a little call into it.

868
00:59:16,661 --> 00:59:19,872
Scott: She would have plugged into that shit and been and hacked in it.

869
00:59:19,892 --> 00:59:21,197
Scott: like who's controlling this drone?

870
00:59:21,217 --> 00:59:22,080
Scott: who programmed it?

871
00:59:22,783 --> 00:59:26,020
Rym: Right yeah, and then it would have to like an evil guy like pulling.

872
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:26,963
Scott: Oh, there's an AI.

873
00:59:26,983 --> 00:59:28,187
Scott: drone is an AI?

874
00:59:28,328 --> 00:59:28,990
Scott: there's an AI.

875
00:59:29,091 --> 00:59:30,977
Scott: someone has actually been trapped in this drone.

876
00:59:31,077 --> 00:59:31,860
Scott: Who is it right?

877
00:59:32,462 --> 00:59:38,800
Rym: The AI who's trapped wants to get the message out and tells the major something that we don't get to see and then that comes up five episodes later.

878
00:59:39,661 --> 00:59:42,112
Scott: Right you know something like that as opposed to all right.

879
00:59:42,132 --> 00:59:43,619
Scott: She dragged it to the ground and destroyed it.

880
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:48,000
Rym: Yeah, mostly oh, but it's still got a missile off which I guess we was trying to do all along.

881
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:53,420
Rym: So I still don't understand what all these pub G like fortnight looking kids are doing in this show in the first place.

882
00:59:54,206 --> 00:59:56,911
Rym: Yeah Anyway, but one thing.

883
00:59:56,932 --> 01:00:13,376
Rym: when I was watching with Emily And she pointed out that the character designs looked like this one designer, and it was Ili I cushion off And those character designs look great Except in the actual show like in the closer or on like that designers Instagram.

884
01:00:13,396 --> 01:00:14,057
Rym: They look great.

885
01:00:14,358 --> 01:00:15,060
Rym: It's just in the show.

886
01:00:15,161 --> 01:00:19,457
Rym: They're animated in this kind of weird ugly one generation to go video game way.

887
01:00:21,602 --> 01:00:22,768
Scott: So I also want to talk about right.

888
01:00:22,788 --> 01:00:31,091
Scott: so we talk about almost all the characters except for Ishikawa right who's basically always been like the hacking dude.

889
01:00:31,232 --> 01:00:34,465
Rym: Yeah, he just sits in the base hacking right He does.

890
01:00:34,526 --> 01:00:35,459
Scott: he does some other stuff.

891
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:37,728
Scott: He does some action also, but you know it's like.

892
01:00:38,090 --> 01:00:45,497
Scott: you know his main plots are like aha I've hacked all the brains of the old dudes in the pachinko parlor to power up my computer right.

893
01:00:45,517 --> 01:00:48,167
Scott: so He doesn't do any of that.

894
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:50,676
Scott: He's basically drives and shoots a machine gun.

895
01:00:50,717 --> 01:00:51,459
Scott: It doesn't do anything else.

896
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:54,609
Rym: What about Saito the the second I know?

897
01:00:54,649 --> 01:00:56,414
Rym: it's still history of the world.

898
01:00:56,755 --> 01:00:58,340
Scott: at least he's still sniper guy.

899
01:00:58,442 --> 01:01:01,589
Rym: Yeah But he also like it doesn't really solve their problem.

900
01:01:01,709 --> 01:01:03,555
Rym: what in regular goes to the shell?

901
01:01:03,836 --> 01:01:06,987
Rym: when Saito gets out his gun The whole point of the show is hit.

902
01:01:07,148 --> 01:01:08,573
Rym: that solves the problem.

903
01:01:08,955 --> 01:01:09,638
Scott: He doesn't miss.

904
01:01:09,919 --> 01:01:11,364
Scott: yeah I think he missed.

905
01:01:11,726 --> 01:01:13,050
Rym: actually I think he did miss.

906
01:01:13,371 --> 01:01:13,773
Rym: he was.

907
01:01:13,813 --> 01:01:15,760
Scott: he was like he tried to shoot the drone and missed.

908
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:16,001
Scott: it's like.

909
01:01:16,021 --> 01:01:19,299
Rym: well cuz it like it hacked him and saw his satellite feed.

910
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:23,635
Rym: and Just the show just doesn't feel like ghost in the shell at all.

911
01:01:24,258 --> 01:01:24,620
Scott: yeah, no.

912
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:30,230
Scott: Anyway, so even though the show is not good.

913
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:36,131
Scott: It is far away from good, right I do want to say it is not the worst.

914
01:01:36,352 --> 01:01:37,175
Rym: Oh, I've seen worse.

915
01:01:37,295 --> 01:01:38,580
Rym: I've seen I see a lot worse.

916
01:01:38,801 --> 01:01:42,755
Scott: So I think what you're seeing I think the reaction to the show saying how bad it is.

917
01:01:43,357 --> 01:01:44,863
Scott: It's not incorrect It is bad.

918
01:01:44,884 --> 01:01:48,039
Rym: well cuz we're comparing it to what the ghost in the shell we like.

919
01:01:48,661 --> 01:01:49,063
Scott: Exactly.

920
01:01:49,143 --> 01:01:57,160
Scott: I think this is a situation much like Death Note where if you haven't read or watched any Death Note Right Death Note has two phases.

921
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:02,193
Scott: There is the beginning like most of Death Note is about this battle between these two characters.

922
01:02:02,514 --> 01:02:16,739
Scott: that battle reaches his climax and conclusion and then some new characters come in and Continue the battle right and then that and and then the month when that battle ends the story ends and that When that second battle begins right?

923
01:02:18,081 --> 01:02:21,493
Scott: People who are fans of Death Note like that a lot less.

924
01:02:21,593 --> 01:02:22,717
Scott: they thought that like they were like.

925
01:02:22,777 --> 01:02:23,620
Scott: oh it turned to garbage.

926
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:26,972
Scott: Right it's like it sucks now only that first battle.

927
01:02:27,052 --> 01:02:29,803
Rym: Yeah good, but the second part wasn't bad It just wasn't.

928
01:02:29,823 --> 01:02:31,349
Scott: a second part wasn't bad.

929
01:02:31,369 --> 01:02:31,410
Scott: It.

930
01:02:31,570 --> 01:02:37,994
Scott: Just wasn't as good and didn't include characters that you had already grown close to and loved right.

931
01:02:38,214 --> 01:02:49,420
Scott: so it felt the relational Feelings right made it seem awful because it's like one second You're eating the best steak on earth and the next second you're eating serviceable steak.

932
01:02:49,741 --> 01:02:52,390
Scott: So it tastes awful, but relatively speaking right.

933
01:02:52,671 --> 01:03:02,748
Scott: whereas if I had just given you serviceable steak you would have said That's pretty good right, but because you were just eating delicious Amazing steak the second one was meh.

934
01:03:02,788 --> 01:03:03,269
Rym: Yeah, right.

935
01:03:03,329 --> 01:03:11,714
Rym: the problem is I feel like anyone who has not already seen all the other ghosts in the shell Wouldn't have anything to even hook them on this show at all.

936
01:03:11,754 --> 01:03:13,080
Rym: they'd watch the first episode and go well.

937
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:22,758
Scott: I would be very interested to see what someone who is doesn't know anything about ghosts in the show would write the show Because I think the problem would be why would you care at all?

938
01:03:23,139 --> 01:03:23,300
Rym: yep?

939
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:29,560
Scott: And because the characters doesn't have the character right it's like not having the character stuff at all.

940
01:03:30,121 --> 01:03:39,755
Scott: At least somebody who's seen other ghosts in the shells might care about the characters because they already care about them because they watched a good Show, but then they're mad because these characters don't live up to those characters.

941
01:03:39,795 --> 01:03:45,876
Scott: right exactly, but If you have not seen anything at all Why do you care at all?

942
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:48,567
Scott: You weren't made to care to start with.

943
01:03:48,909 --> 01:03:53,874
Scott: yeah, right where you see something like you know if you read You know it's really always really good at.

944
01:03:53,915 --> 01:03:56,494
Scott: this is What's it called?

945
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:04,177
Scott: Noki Urasawa, right You read a Noki Urasawa manga, and there'll be like a character who's there for one chapter.

946
01:04:04,197 --> 01:04:08,737
Rym: right like you Read a chapter you look at it start as if you're like who's this guy?

947
01:04:08,818 --> 01:04:09,360
Rym: end of the chapter.

948
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:11,429
Rym: You're literally crying master Keaton.

949
01:04:11,770 --> 01:04:17,960
Scott: meet someone at the beginning of this chapter And they're dead at the end and you just met them and you dirt.

950
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:22,977
Scott: They only exist for 20 pages, and he made you care about them in 20 pages.

951
01:04:23,118 --> 01:04:28,876
Scott: Yeah, right It's like you might even cry over that person ghost in the shell thinking about a specific Pluto thing.

952
01:04:28,916 --> 01:04:30,200
Rym: that happens right.

953
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:31,364
Scott: It's like the shell.

954
01:04:31,825 --> 01:04:38,370
Scott: I've seen two movies and two TV series and two mangas and You can't make me.

955
01:04:38,491 --> 01:04:42,519
Scott: you made me uncare About the character yep.

956
01:04:43,652 --> 01:04:47,168
Rym: so Don't recommend actually watching this one.

957
01:04:47,228 --> 01:04:48,592
Rym: really like no.

958
01:04:48,793 --> 01:04:49,956
Scott: I just I'm saying it's like.

959
01:04:50,097 --> 01:04:51,140
Scott: it's not a zero.

960
01:04:51,421 --> 01:04:55,313
Scott: It's like well cuz the zero is like Legend of Len mere right.

961
01:04:55,374 --> 01:04:56,297
Scott: It's not trash.

962
01:04:56,838 --> 01:05:00,365
Scott: It's just man It's below man.

963
01:05:00,806 --> 01:05:02,512
Scott: Yeah, it's more like.

964
01:05:02,632 --> 01:05:05,020
Scott: it's like it's fart noise, but poop doesn't come out.

965
01:05:05,422 --> 01:05:18,639
Rym: Yeah, like you won't you know you're not forced to flee But it's sad trombone Yeah, which is such a shame, but on the other hand it reminded me that I could just watch standalone complex.

966
01:05:18,679 --> 01:05:18,860
Rym: again.

967
01:05:19,662 --> 01:05:20,846
Scott: I forgot most of it.

968
01:05:20,946 --> 01:05:21,428
Scott: Let's go.

969
01:05:21,609 --> 01:05:21,990
Scott: Yeah.

970
01:05:22,391 --> 01:05:23,354
Rym: I want to get all that.

971
01:05:23,655 --> 01:05:25,100
Scott: I remember the big parts.

972
01:05:25,321 --> 01:05:28,440
Scott: I just don't remember any of the details cuz it's been how many years yep.

973
01:05:29,464 --> 01:05:30,999
Rym: So uh yeah, that was our review.

974
01:05:31,441 --> 01:05:41,369
Scott: I'm curious to see what any of you think if you've even watched this because we're ever but in the in the future if there is Even bad stuff right don't.

975
01:05:41,630 --> 01:05:44,719
Scott: if some people are saying something's bad don't subject yourself to it.

976
01:05:45,241 --> 01:05:51,020
Scott: We will do that service for you, and then add our opinion to the pile of everyone else's opinion.

977
01:05:51,383 --> 01:06:00,746
Rym: I think we'll only do that though if it's plenty to also Could be good things that are like bad like things that in judge anime by its cover We would just say as bad outright.

978
01:06:00,967 --> 01:06:02,333
Rym: We're not gonna bother doing this way.

979
01:06:03,056 --> 01:06:05,260
Scott: Yeah, we'll see But yeah, we're gonna.

980
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:07,459
Scott: You know I don't want to just always have GeekNights be.

981
01:06:08,142 --> 01:06:13,200
Scott: We watched played read a good thing and then told you about it, and we knew it was good before we started.

982
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:18,602
Scott: Yeah, we got to go into some uncharted or questionable You know.

983
01:06:19,204 --> 01:06:24,520
Scott: go pass some warning signs into dangerous territories to report our findings and do some reconnaissance.

984
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:29,566
Rym: Yeah We used to do a lot more bad reviews especially of anime and video games And board games.

985
01:06:29,586 --> 01:06:32,679
Rym: part of the reason why we avoid bad reviews of board games is that?

986
01:06:34,141 --> 01:06:35,288
Rym: most board games are bad.

987
01:06:35,651 --> 01:06:42,380
Rym: like most things are bad and We just don't even bother playing bad board games like we don't even have anything to say about them.

988
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:44,086
Scott: It takes such a time investment.

989
01:06:44,146 --> 01:06:55,183
Scott: I think yeah, it took me less than an hour to watch these two episodes But to but to play a bad board game enough to be able to properly critique Why it's bad.

990
01:06:55,484 --> 01:06:59,519
Rym: that would take like eight hours of work, and that is not worth it for a bad board game.

991
01:07:04,606 --> 01:07:07,150
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
