1
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,891
Rym: It's Wednesday September 30th 2020.

2
00:00:11,891 --> 00:00:12,272
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,034 --> 00:00:14,899
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:18,240
Rym: tonight We are talking about the Thunder cats.

5
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:31,319
Rym: so If you listen to or you don't like live under a rock despite the world being on fire and the rise of fascism and everything Star Wars squadrons is coming out like in two days.

6
00:00:32,302 --> 00:00:39,409
Scott: So this is basically a game, you know, it is a maybe is it the culmination of GeekNights' Unrealized potential?

7
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:40,538
Scott: where is we taught it?

8
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,557
Scott: We talked about every genre of game that had not been.

9
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:52,988
Scott: you know That had been dead for a long time and had no one had brought back like what on the panel to have not been able To record that like.

10
00:00:53,008 --> 00:00:54,515
Rym: I wish we had a recording slides.

11
00:00:54,796 --> 00:00:55,540
Rym: I do have the slides.

12
00:00:55,921 --> 00:00:57,327
Rym: I. we should bring those slides out.

13
00:00:57,347 --> 00:01:03,116
Scott: that panel follow up but unlike the that panel We can't redo because it's not true anymore.

14
00:01:03,317 --> 00:01:10,240
Rym: No, no There is very little untapped space now in the gaming world and there are other reasons why things don't get made.

15
00:01:10,661 --> 00:01:19,980
Rym: But yeah, the point of that panel was like there's all these obvious Guaranteed to make money games you should just make based on previous games that were popular.

16
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:20,422
Rym: That's just no.

17
00:01:20,483 --> 00:01:28,658
Rym: one did for some reason and this is the penultimate one remake tie fighter x-wing x-wing verse tie fighter x-wing Alliance on modern tech.

18
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,544
Scott: and When did so?

19
00:01:30,584 --> 00:01:32,952
Scott: the last game the last free.

20
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:35,540
Scott: there are some free space shooting games out there, right?

21
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:36,705
Rym: Yeah, some of them are just like.

22
00:01:36,745 --> 00:01:41,090
Rym: they're really just more like MMOs or They're not good.

23
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,560
Scott: Oh, that's that one.

24
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,844
Scott: We're like docking.

25
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:48,420
Scott: is really it to be like really careful docking and stuff that actually does not narrow it down that much?

26
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:54,730
Scott: No, it's it's one people in the sky Man, oh, that's the scam Kickstarter one.

27
00:01:54,771 --> 00:01:56,458
Rym: Yeah, but there is some flying around in that one.

28
00:01:57,721 --> 00:02:04,040
Scott: Anyway, the point is there are some recent games that are technically free space shooters, right?

29
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,880
Scott: But they're not really free space.

30
00:02:08,381 --> 00:02:09,746
Rym: They're not what we wanted.

31
00:02:09,826 --> 00:02:14,340
Rym: We wanted x-wings anti fighters in a very particular way, right?

32
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,695
Scott: It doesn't have to be extra, you know, there are like.

33
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:18,343
Scott: there are some Flight.

34
00:02:18,363 --> 00:02:21,492
Scott: there's like ace combat type games with your flight, but that's not in space.

35
00:02:21,953 --> 00:02:22,114
Scott: Right?

36
00:02:22,134 --> 00:02:23,197
Scott: That's air right?

37
00:02:23,237 --> 00:02:36,760
Scott: It's not the same thing You know, so there were some games that were like Like sort of descent like remakes in a fashion right but descent is inside.

38
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,208
Scott: It's still free space shooter, but it's inside right?

39
00:02:39,228 --> 00:02:41,556
Scott: You don't go outdoors in a big open area, right?

40
00:02:42,178 --> 00:02:43,883
Scott: But anyway, yeah So it's been.

41
00:02:44,104 --> 00:02:45,489
Scott: when did x-wing Alliance come out?

42
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,740
Rym: Oh my god x-wing Alliance is so old.

43
00:02:48,860 --> 00:03:03,540
Scott: I don't even remember x-wing Alliance came out in 1999. so it's been 21 years since we have had a game in this series of Live out your fantasy of being a Star Wars fighter pilot for either rebels or the Empire.

44
00:03:03,942 --> 00:03:06,532
Rym: I was like hyper obsessed with TIE fighter as a kid.

45
00:03:06,632 --> 00:03:07,576
Rym: that came with so good.

46
00:03:07,878 --> 00:03:11,851
Scott: Here we go Finally in Friday two days from the recording of this podcast.

47
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:14,360
Scott: tomorrow for most of you it comes out.

48
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:19,200
Scott: It's coming from EA which is bad, but somehow I don't know how this happened.

49
00:03:19,863 --> 00:03:27,631
Scott: They if you look at all the information available about this game Somehow on paper EA has done everything right.

50
00:03:27,932 --> 00:03:30,980
Scott: the game's $40 a reasonable price probably too cheap.

51
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:35,511
Scott: In fact, considering what it cost to make games these days There doesn't seem to be any DLC.

52
00:03:35,531 --> 00:03:37,040
Scott: that doesn't seem to be any pay to win.

53
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:50,972
Rym: There's no microtransactions of any kind and the fact that they said that in the original press release like they knew People like like the people like us we're all watching that early press release just waiting for it to be terrible And they were like two minutes in.

54
00:03:50,992 --> 00:04:08,070
Scott: they're like no microtransactions No, no, no appears to be a ski again a skill based game where nothing has been Simplified or dumbed down in any way shape or form and all of the preview teaser videos of the game Show things that only excite and do not disappoint.

55
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:14,359
Scott: So my expectations are still not high Because I've been burned how the world works.

56
00:04:15,551 --> 00:04:21,320
Scott: But But oh, I'm still gonna pay $40 and try to find out on Friday.

57
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:26,254
Rym: So and this game supports VR like my dream was to have a VR headset and play the game.

58
00:04:26,395 --> 00:04:28,260
Scott: optional optional VR support.

59
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,785
Scott: Optional hotels support.

60
00:04:29,905 --> 00:04:31,871
Scott: everything is lining up perfectly.

61
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:33,596
Scott: So we're gonna play this.

62
00:04:33,676 --> 00:04:34,800
Scott: come join our squadron.

63
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:42,580
Scott: I'm gonna play with mouse and keyboard But if it becomes a real thing and our squadron sticks together and keeps playing then I'll go buy some sticks.

64
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,719
Rym: This means you got to pull your weight.

65
00:04:45,606 --> 00:04:48,783
Rym: so my problem is independent of that.

66
00:04:49,084 --> 00:04:58,117
Rym: Microsoft had to fucking release a flight simulator and basically every hot ass which also Microsoft flight simulator has not been released in how long?

67
00:04:58,177 --> 00:04:58,840
Scott: yeah, and you know what?

68
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,084
Rym: I really want to play that too.

69
00:05:00,104 --> 00:05:00,385
Rym: You know what?

70
00:05:00,405 --> 00:05:03,739
Rym: I don't have a hot ass because they are sold out everywhere on earth.

71
00:05:05,061 --> 00:05:08,730
Rym: Yeah, that's fine because until Microsoft flight simulator and Star Wars quadrants.

72
00:05:09,191 --> 00:05:10,494
Rym: There was almost nothing.

73
00:05:10,634 --> 00:05:19,799
Rym: anyone needed a hot ass for You could use like X plane or so those Simulators, but you said the word nerdy.

74
00:05:20,181 --> 00:05:21,965
Rym: Those are not what?

75
00:05:22,045 --> 00:05:27,720
Rym: not that many people cared enough to spend like hundreds of dollars on basically a joystick?

76
00:05:28,842 --> 00:05:32,460
Rym: Yeah, and even if you did what games you gonna play with it the one game you cared about?

77
00:05:32,762 --> 00:05:35,220
Rym: There's a reason why I only owned two joysticks.

78
00:05:35,481 --> 00:05:44,406
Rym: So they were buried like deep under the bed like in a container Covered in dust because I have had not had a need for a joystick in Well over a decade.

79
00:05:44,929 --> 00:05:47,000
Rym: so my what happened to me?

80
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,675
Rym: We're not gonna review Star Wars or talk about it because the game's gonna come out.

81
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,480
Rym: We'll talk about that on Tuesday.

82
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,865
Scott: Oh, it's endless space.

83
00:05:51,905 --> 00:05:53,250
Scott: Is that the one that's one of them?

84
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:54,515
Scott: No, it's.

85
00:05:54,535 --> 00:05:54,937
Scott: it's.

86
00:05:54,977 --> 00:05:55,820
Scott: that's a strategy game.

87
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,242
Scott: It's not though.

88
00:05:56,343 --> 00:06:01,366
Rym: Oh, I'm think there's a game that has a name like that that I played and yeah That's the one I'm trying to think of.

89
00:06:01,547 --> 00:06:02,692
Scott: I can't remember it right now.

90
00:06:02,752 --> 00:06:03,796
Scott: It's probably my elite date.

91
00:06:03,877 --> 00:06:05,925
Rym: elite dangerous That's one of them.

92
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:06,710
Rym: That's not good.

93
00:06:06,751 --> 00:06:08,200
Rym: I did not enjoy elite dangerous at all.

94
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:13,160
Scott: Elite dangerous is the existing free space shooter where you have to dock very carefully.

95
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:16,287
Rym: So I go and take out these joysticks.

96
00:06:16,428 --> 00:06:18,174
Rym: one of them just doesn't work at all.

97
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:19,780
Rym: It's USB like one.

98
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:20,784
Rym: That's how old it is.

99
00:06:20,845 --> 00:06:21,648
Rym: It just didn't work.

100
00:06:22,151 --> 00:06:24,220
Scott: It just doesn't work like just throw it out in the garbage.

101
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,168
Rym: Yeah, I threw it out in the garbage.

102
00:06:25,209 --> 00:06:29,390
Rym: I plugged it in and Windows was like I don't recognize that device.

103
00:06:29,892 --> 00:06:31,457
Scott: I don't think you just need a driver.

104
00:06:31,477 --> 00:06:32,180
Scott: You just need driver.

105
00:06:32,382 --> 00:06:34,319
Rym: Yeah, good that I don't think a driver existed for it.

106
00:06:35,401 --> 00:06:36,164
Scott: That's not broken.

107
00:06:36,184 --> 00:06:38,836
Scott: that just means that Windows can't automatically find the driver.

108
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:40,181
Scott: no, no, no No, nothing.

109
00:06:40,221 --> 00:06:43,111
Rym: I got the warning of there's something wrong with this device too.

110
00:06:43,151 --> 00:06:44,796
Rym: Like it was there was some problem with it.

111
00:06:44,816 --> 00:06:47,930
Scott: I Have feeling if you did a driver it would have worked.

112
00:06:48,212 --> 00:06:49,760
Scott: It also really has nothing happened.

113
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,210
Rym: It also only has two buttons on it.

114
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,620
Rym: So it wouldn't have even worked for this purpose.

115
00:06:53,701 --> 00:07:01,598
Scott: Yeah, you need any quite a few buttons to put to play a Star Wars, but the other thing in that box was a mad cat v1 stick.

116
00:07:02,861 --> 00:07:05,148
Rym: So I got that one out that one has twisting.

117
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:12,108
Rym: it has the throttle in it like that'll actually work like it's basically the Shittiest possible modern USB joystick.

118
00:07:12,529 --> 00:07:13,411
Rym: It does just work.

119
00:07:13,712 --> 00:07:16,780
Scott: However, I'm looking at a picture of this stick on the internet.

120
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,467
Scott: And yeah, that's it's the bare minimum.

121
00:07:19,848 --> 00:07:21,032
Rym: It's the bare minimum.

122
00:07:21,072 --> 00:07:22,014
Rym: It's the bottom of the.

123
00:07:22,315 --> 00:07:22,837
Scott: it's got.

124
00:07:23,338 --> 00:07:26,719
Scott: it's got a trigger It's got five buttons and it's got more than five buttons.

125
00:07:27,821 --> 00:07:29,266
Scott: There's five gray buttons for the.

126
00:07:29,286 --> 00:07:31,093
Rym: yeah, there's also a pinky button.

127
00:07:31,113 --> 00:07:32,900
Rym: this had a fire button and a hat.

128
00:07:33,623 --> 00:07:34,467
Scott: Oh, there's more on the front.

129
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:35,854
Scott: He has one hat in the middle there.

130
00:07:36,216 --> 00:07:38,705
Scott: It's also got a. There's a pinky button.

131
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:39,949
Scott: Where's the pinky buttons?

132
00:07:40,431 --> 00:07:41,133
Rym: throttles on the back?

133
00:07:41,193 --> 00:07:42,056
Rym: You're just like a little lever.

134
00:07:42,076 --> 00:07:46,436
Scott: Oh It's that little tiny thing that doesn't even look like a throttle that looks like a foot.

135
00:07:46,697 --> 00:07:47,180
Rym: Yeah, but it is.

136
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:48,586
Rym: It'll be good enough.

137
00:07:48,967 --> 00:07:49,991
Rym: The only problem with this thing.

138
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:50,493
Rym: It works like.

139
00:07:50,534 --> 00:07:51,839
Rym: I tested it and I also fixed it.

140
00:07:52,281 --> 00:07:55,560
Rym: However, it was so old because I bought this to play like x-wing Alliance.

141
00:07:55,681 --> 00:07:56,707
Scott: What do you be better to just do?

142
00:07:56,748 --> 00:07:57,452
Scott: mouse and keyboard?

143
00:07:57,593 --> 00:07:58,096
Scott: No, fuck.

144
00:07:58,157 --> 00:07:58,680
Rym: Are you kidding?

145
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,712
Rym: You're gonna be awful at this game with mouse and keyboard.

146
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:03,480
Scott: keyboards got a lot a lot of buttons.

147
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:09,080
Rym: Yeah, I don't think you're gonna be able to hit me at any point in this game with a mouse and keyboard.

148
00:08:09,782 --> 00:08:14,740
Scott: I mean if you use mouse and keyboard the control setup is use the mouse for the pitch in the yaw, right?

149
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,019
Scott: Yeah, and then you use your you know your triggers on the mouse for firing right and you know.

150
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:25,979
Scott: And then on the keyboard you got WASD basically for strafing left right up down right up down strafe.

151
00:08:26,764 --> 00:08:29,519
Scott: And then you use QE for roll left and right.

152
00:08:31,141 --> 00:08:38,313
Scott: And then you got to control your throttle maybe with the mouse wheel or the thumb buttons on the side of the mouse All right, then I can switch weapons like it starts.

153
00:08:38,414 --> 00:08:39,097
Rym: Here's the real problem.

154
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:39,360
Rym: You're gonna.

155
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,345
Rym: Yeah, is it what do you want?

156
00:08:41,405 --> 00:08:42,769
Rym: Do you want where?

157
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:52,315
Rym: if you keep moving the mouse forward you keep going like Turning forward like rolling down or whatever you're gonna do or do you want it to be where?

158
00:08:52,556 --> 00:08:58,799
Rym: if you move the mouse a certain Amount it's like holding out at the top of a joystick because neither of those options works worth a shit.

159
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:06,239
Scott: That's true because like a joystick right is I think they're going And it's gonna be a problem.

160
00:09:07,201 --> 00:09:10,974
Scott: Yeah, if you have an analog stick like on a gamepad, right?

161
00:09:11,215 --> 00:09:12,720
Scott: It's like yeah, it re-centers.

162
00:09:12,821 --> 00:09:16,372
Scott: You know if you hold it all the way forward It's gonna keep going right.

163
00:09:16,714 --> 00:09:19,003
Scott: a mouse doesn't re-center Exactly.

164
00:09:19,364 --> 00:09:21,374
Rym: So that's where I think you're gonna have a lot of trouble.

165
00:09:21,414 --> 00:09:22,740
Rym: You're not gonna be able to maneuver very well.

166
00:09:23,022 --> 00:09:26,684
Rym: You're gonna be like someone playing doom Without a wonder.

167
00:09:26,744 --> 00:09:40,698
Scott: if I could play really shittily on this SN 30 plus you might be better off using a joy gamepad instead like use the Use the switch pro controller, but SN 30 plus has everything more than has everything right?

168
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:41,220
Scott: I wonder.

169
00:09:41,361 --> 00:09:42,408
Rym: I think you'll be they do.

170
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:44,320
Rym: they did say that controllers are supported.

171
00:09:44,862 --> 00:09:45,686
Rym: I think a controller.

172
00:09:45,706 --> 00:09:47,714
Scott: sure they're supported but how good.

173
00:09:47,894 --> 00:09:51,693
Scott: I'm trying to think like, okay So I have an analog stick right for a pitch in y'all, right?

174
00:09:51,713 --> 00:09:53,241
Scott: I actually got two analog sticks I don't know.

175
00:09:53,261 --> 00:09:57,594
Scott: I'll use the other one for and then I can just strafe with the d-pad.

176
00:09:57,895 --> 00:09:59,580
Scott: How do I roll with LNR?

177
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,140
Scott: Accelerate and decelerate with the other LNR and then I got four more buttons for stuff.

178
00:10:05,321 --> 00:10:07,896
Rym: There isn't really strafing in a game like this though.

179
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:13,214
Scott: the way yeah You when you're you're you move straight up like like you're like you're.

180
00:10:13,334 --> 00:10:15,380
Rym: that's not something that's high fighter lets you do.

181
00:10:15,661 --> 00:10:17,029
Rym: I don't think this game lets you do that either.

182
00:10:17,069 --> 00:10:18,155
Rym: you had a for descent.

183
00:10:18,216 --> 00:10:18,980
Scott: descent lets you do.

184
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,984
Scott: What does that?

185
00:10:20,024 --> 00:10:20,967
Rym: none of these other games do?

186
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:22,554
Scott: Oh that makes it easier.

187
00:10:22,594 --> 00:10:23,517
Scott: then that means four things.

188
00:10:23,577 --> 00:10:24,220
Scott: I don't have to map.

189
00:10:24,421 --> 00:10:27,010
Rym: Yeah, yeah, it's just forward and just straight.

190
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:32,064
Scott: let see but that's the thing is actually consider descent right that you need.

191
00:10:32,305 --> 00:10:39,918
Scott: I consider having all those controls to be what a free space shooter is because if you actually had a Spaceship it could do all those things.

192
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,685
Scott: yeah But I have any free space shooters.

193
00:10:41,705 --> 00:10:45,980
Rym: the genre usually means things more like Star Wars games where that is not true.

194
00:10:46,162 --> 00:10:48,020
Rym: None of those Star Wars games had that kind of motion.

195
00:10:49,505 --> 00:10:50,499
Scott: I thought you could move straight.

196
00:10:53,181 --> 00:10:54,485
Scott: Actually just takes off.

197
00:10:54,545 --> 00:10:57,876
Scott: it just goes straight up right it doesn't go off a ramp like a.

198
00:10:58,378 --> 00:11:01,480
Rym: you know Valkyrie Did you actually play x-wing and tie fighter?

199
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,046
Scott: Watch Star Wars x-wing go straight up.

200
00:11:04,086 --> 00:11:05,773
Rym: Yeah, but we're talking about the games.

201
00:11:05,834 --> 00:11:07,099
Rym: the games did not have that.

202
00:11:07,721 --> 00:11:08,605
Rym: They never had that.

203
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:10,312
Scott: I'll have to go look that up.

204
00:11:10,432 --> 00:11:12,200
Rym: I think your brain is playing tricks on you.

205
00:11:12,765 --> 00:11:14,220
Scott: Let's move on to the news anyway.

206
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:30,390
Rym: Yeah the problem with his joystick was it was sticky like the buttons made the sickening sound when I pushed them and I had to take the whole thing apart and like clean it with mineral oil and solvents and like air dusters and everything to make it not feel disgusting to use.

207
00:11:32,891 --> 00:11:36,426
Rym: And That seems to happen with joysticks that don't have their buttons pressed often enough.

208
00:11:36,728 --> 00:11:38,877
Rym: in general That was the only thing I was getting to.

209
00:11:38,917 --> 00:11:40,864
Rym: the joystick was disgusting, but it does work.

210
00:11:41,627 --> 00:11:42,210
Rym: So you got any news.

211
00:11:44,011 --> 00:11:44,593
Scott: What was my news?

212
00:11:44,633 --> 00:11:45,858
Scott: yeah actual anime news.

213
00:11:45,898 --> 00:11:50,756
Scott: here we go right long awaited the movie Lupin.

214
00:11:50,796 --> 00:11:52,129
Scott: the third the first.

215
00:11:54,115 --> 00:11:54,807
Scott: That's a mouthful.

216
00:11:56,052 --> 00:12:01,513
Scott: G kids licensed it as expected and they're releasing it in theaters In the u.s.

217
00:12:01,574 --> 00:12:03,038
Rym: It's the 3d CG Lupin.

218
00:12:03,861 --> 00:12:05,346
Rym: I'm pretty excited about it.

219
00:12:05,406 --> 00:12:11,754
Scott: what I saw looked at rate Yep at the online and a see Earlier this year.

220
00:12:11,874 --> 00:12:13,078
Scott: We saw like the first.

221
00:12:13,419 --> 00:12:15,244
Scott: five to ten minutes of it looks terrific.

222
00:12:15,705 --> 00:12:17,510
Scott: I've been eagerly awaiting this movie.

223
00:12:17,632 --> 00:12:18,341
Scott: I want to watch it.

224
00:12:20,431 --> 00:12:26,910
Scott: But the problem is yeah, New York unlike other states is wisely not allowing people to go to movie theaters.

225
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:34,390
Rym: Yeah Yeah, so if I zoom in on this map here, there's like terrifying deadly showings all over America.

226
00:12:34,491 --> 00:12:42,127
Rym: Do not go to these showings if you're listening to this, but if you zoom in There's nothing in New York Not anyone in the whole state.

227
00:12:43,402 --> 00:12:43,570
Scott: Nope.

228
00:12:44,595 --> 00:12:55,787
Scott: however While it is going to be in select theaters, October 18th dub 21st sub I guess if you find a movie theater, you can go to all alone safely.

229
00:12:55,868 --> 00:12:58,449
Scott: somehow I mean, I can't stop you, right?

230
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:02,717
Scott: Don't go to the movies Do not go to the movies theater.

231
00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:05,946
Scott: Maybe someone will do it an outdoor showing or something.

232
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:08,990
Scott: Oh drive-in Yeah, who knows anyway?

233
00:13:10,052 --> 00:13:15,665
Scott: the point is That they are going to soon after I think possibly as soon as December.

234
00:13:15,785 --> 00:13:17,270
Scott: it will be available on.

235
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:22,668
Scott: I'm not 100% sure of the date, but it will be available in.

236
00:13:23,813 --> 00:13:28,410
Scott: You know bought to buy like, you know streaming or booray discs or whatever.

237
00:13:28,551 --> 00:13:40,210
Scott: Yeah, figure out where and then you can watch it that way in your house yes, so No, you know, this will be like the first time I think G kids has released a Japanese animation and a distributed in the u.s.

238
00:13:40,772 --> 00:13:44,289
Scott: That we will not see it in the theaters and immediately do an episode on it.

239
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:45,377
Scott: You're gonna have to wait a little.

240
00:13:45,438 --> 00:13:53,398
Scott: you have to wait a little bit, but For some reason I think we're probably just gonna say my prediction of my judging anime by its cover.

241
00:13:53,919 --> 00:14:03,130
Scott: It's going to be a cookie cutter By the book Lupin movie that is of high quality, but not legendary.

242
00:14:03,331 --> 00:14:09,056
Scott: It's no food, but right now it will not divert from the Lupin formula But it will also not be.

243
00:14:09,076 --> 00:14:21,530
Scott: it will be a excellent execution of the Lupin formula with terrific Animation and voice acting and such and Well worth your time because an excellent execution of the Lupin formula is worth everyone's time.

244
00:14:21,691 --> 00:14:29,005
Rym: Yeah, I mean, I'll even enjoy a really bad Lupin movie Like I'll go deep into the Lupin library before it's unwatchable to me.

245
00:14:29,025 --> 00:14:32,361
Rym: So yep I'm a Lupin movie that's just right middle of the road.

246
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:35,487
Rym: That is a must-see anime movie That's right.

247
00:14:36,614 --> 00:14:37,099
Scott: So there you go.

248
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:38,070
Rym: So some other news.

249
00:14:38,251 --> 00:14:44,623
Rym: I actually have watched most of the first season of the owl house Which is a I had never even heard of this.

250
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:45,869
Scott: and still you started posting pictures.

251
00:14:47,032 --> 00:14:47,956
Rym: It was really big.

252
00:14:48,016 --> 00:14:49,402
Rym: It's a Disney TV show.

253
00:14:49,482 --> 00:14:51,490
Rym: Like there's a whole story behind.

254
00:14:51,651 --> 00:14:54,943
Scott: I never even I didn't even know it existed until you posted owl photos.

255
00:14:55,365 --> 00:14:56,650
Rym: Okay, that's I don't do that.

256
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:59,050
Rym: I think you might literally be living under a rock first.

257
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:03,309
Rym: You think that there's translating movement in TIE fighter and now you've never heard of this Disney show.

258
00:15:04,311 --> 00:15:05,960
Rym: Anyway, it is a kids show.

259
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,865
Rym: It's Alex Hirsch.

260
00:15:06,946 --> 00:15:19,610
Rym: Like it's a kids show about a girl who goes to a fantasy world to become a witch and sort of like lives with this witch who doesn't Follow the rules and a demon who's kind of her pet but also her friend and pretty standard kids.

261
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:19,850
Rym: you're like.

262
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:32,915
Rym: I'm not gonna really get into like what it's really about or anything but having watched most of it what I will say is that as a kids show it is really really good and Despite being a kids show.

263
00:15:32,935 --> 00:15:35,925
Rym: I am enjoying it to a very high degree.

264
00:15:36,005 --> 00:15:42,970
Rym: Like I would say it is Twice as funny as Gravity Falls and aimed at the same demographic as Gravity Falls.

265
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:50,470
Scott: Mmm, like I mean the people who enjoyed Gravity Falls are how many years older than they were when they watched Gravity Falls?

266
00:15:50,743 --> 00:15:58,469
Rym: Yeah But the people who would have watched Gravity Falls when it came out like Gravity Falls kids show had some stuff for us had some Stuff for older people, but it was really in the end like a kids show.

267
00:15:59,072 --> 00:16:12,759
Rym: But the Owl House is sort of you know, how like Simpsons earlier seasons like during the Golden Era We're just dense with jokes and dense with writing and like just like there was a density of Entertainment that is lacking from later Simpsons.

268
00:16:13,221 --> 00:16:17,476
Rym: The Owl House compared to Gravity Falls is Extremely dense in that regard.

269
00:16:17,557 --> 00:16:18,801
Rym: it trusts you to catch jokes.

270
00:16:19,122 --> 00:16:19,965
Rym: It moves pretty quick.

271
00:16:20,748 --> 00:16:23,537
Rym: It's Really really funny and the writing is really good.

272
00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:29,116
Rym: and I would say like just watch the show go get it and watch it Without even listening to anything else.

273
00:16:29,157 --> 00:16:32,370
Rym: I would say because I get that at some point Scott will watch it.

274
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:33,245
Rym: we'll do a full review.

275
00:16:33,346 --> 00:16:35,574
Rym: but Not only is it really good.

276
00:16:35,855 --> 00:16:39,887
Rym: It's also pretty gay just openly like characters just gay getting relationships.

277
00:16:39,908 --> 00:16:40,650
Rym: That's totally fine.

278
00:16:41,051 --> 00:16:51,146
Rym: it's very much a modern kids show and it's also continuing this trend that Gravity Falls was also a part of where Shows that are aimed at kids are aimed at kids.

279
00:16:51,186 --> 00:16:53,938
Rym: without being Insipid or saccharine.

280
00:16:54,219 --> 00:17:08,768
Scott: this show gets dark and weird like darker than you would expect and Weirder than you would expect and I mean Adventure Time already set that bar right and that probably wasn't even You know the start of it.

281
00:17:09,386 --> 00:17:10,272
Rym: Yeah It definitely wasn't.

282
00:17:10,334 --> 00:17:11,900
Rym: but we've seen this trend bit by bit.

283
00:17:11,941 --> 00:17:19,210
Rym: more and more of more and more properties are Willing to be the level of dark and weird that actually resonates with kids.

284
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:20,199
Rym: Like when I was a kid like.

285
00:17:20,259 --> 00:17:21,430
Rym: I watch shows like Thundercats.

286
00:17:21,512 --> 00:17:34,789
Rym: They were okay But the darker and weirder shows were the more I was into them and a lot of adults especially in the 80s and early 90s really underestimated how Complex of a story or how deep a show could get?

287
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,377
Rym: For kids where kids would still enjoy it.

288
00:17:37,438 --> 00:17:40,150
Rym: kind of like how kids like scary movies kids probably.

289
00:17:40,532 --> 00:17:43,590
Scott: I don't think it's a. I don't think it's a trend anymore, right?

290
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:47,910
Scott: I think it's been just the way of things for quite a while.

291
00:17:48,552 --> 00:17:52,483
Rym: I don't think it has been because for every show like Gravity Falls or our our Owl House.

292
00:17:52,764 --> 00:17:59,390
Rym: There is a raft of just Completely saccharine insipid nonsense that like we're not gonna watch like what?

293
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:02,509
Rym: I don't go on Netflix and look at like all the kids shows that are out right now.

294
00:18:03,112 --> 00:18:09,743
Scott: I mean the only time I really see stuff like that is like stuff for like preschoolers like Peppa Pig or whatever And that's not even Peppa Pig's actually not too bad.

295
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:13,678
Scott: Yeah, but I guess But you're not gonna watch Peppa Pig.

296
00:18:13,838 --> 00:18:15,483
Scott: No, right, but it's not.

297
00:18:15,824 --> 00:18:17,910
Scott: Peppa Pig isn't just like nothing, you know.

298
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:20,379
Scott: It's actually like if you have a preschool kid, they're watching Peppa Pig.

299
00:18:20,419 --> 00:18:20,981
Scott: It's like I.

300
00:18:21,764 --> 00:18:32,958
Rym: I do enjoy how the world of the Owl House is basically a City that was built in the decaying body of a giant who died at some point in the distant past Mm-hmm, like.

301
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:33,986
Rym: that's basically the setting.

302
00:18:35,016 --> 00:18:36,372
Rym: So check this show out like.

303
00:18:36,492 --> 00:18:45,608
Rym: I'm really enjoying it and it's sort of Infiltrating my like memetic life and I'm referencing it a lot even when I don't intend to and that's usually.

304
00:18:45,648 --> 00:18:56,190
Rym: that's how Adventure time was when I first started watching it Scratching a very similar itch to how the early Adventure Time episodes sort of dragged me in the only kids show thing.

305
00:18:56,752 --> 00:19:00,890
Rym: That is annoying about this show is that it has a moral in every episode.

306
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:06,487
Rym: But the moral is always the same even if it's very brief and doesn't get in the way.

307
00:19:06,507 --> 00:19:19,579
Rym: and the moral is always one of the characters will face a moral conundrum and do the wrong thing like uppercase W wrong thing that will cause Extremely dangerous situations.

308
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:25,504
Rym: at some point that character will admit what they did wrong Apologize and then work to fix it.

309
00:19:26,287 --> 00:19:31,329
Rym: and it happens Like it's like the utensil stairs that scene in every episode.

310
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:34,362
Scott: Mmm, that's a good formula.

311
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:42,789
Rym: Yeah, it works pretty well Like it's a good lesson for kids to learn while they're also like getting invested in these pixies that want to steal people's skin for undisclosed reasons.

312
00:19:48,137 --> 00:19:54,805
Rym: but anyway things Of the day what he got What was my thing of the day?

313
00:19:54,825 --> 00:19:55,510
Scott: Oh, right.

314
00:19:56,551 --> 00:20:02,350
Scott: So if you're listening to this odds are like nearly a hundred percent chance that you do not have to wait.

315
00:20:02,771 --> 00:20:05,278
Scott: But we have to wait another two to three hours.

316
00:20:05,378 --> 00:20:07,283
Scott: I imagine it for the release.

317
00:20:07,303 --> 00:20:09,469
Rym: I mean, I've been waiting my entire life.

318
00:20:10,316 --> 00:20:13,333
Scott: album of the century Neil's is sir.

319
00:20:13,434 --> 00:20:19,164
Scott: Ega's sister Ega sister Ega's mouth dreams Right, so we had.

320
00:20:19,204 --> 00:20:21,011
Scott: we had mouth moods Right.

321
00:20:21,031 --> 00:20:27,790
Rym: Well if the first ones was mouth sounds which was a lot of smash mouth Matt like mix up mashup type things.

322
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:32,307
Rym: mouth silence was when the genre like this series of albums moved from.

323
00:20:32,327 --> 00:20:39,030
Rym: I appreciate this music because it's weird and speaks to the weird things that I'm into and references the things I like to.

324
00:20:39,692 --> 00:20:43,926
Rym: This is music that I will listen to even if it is not weird and memetic music like mouth.

325
00:20:43,967 --> 00:20:44,930
Rym: Silence is a good album.

326
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:49,090
Scott: Yeah, mouth moods is legendary, right that is the most.

327
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,456
Scott: Masters is from what you have.

328
00:20:51,476 --> 00:20:52,921
Scott: tiger the tiger.

329
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:55,390
Scott: Those are the two but like all of them are great.

330
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:58,985
Scott: But those two definitely stand out amongst, you know the rest.

331
00:20:59,185 --> 00:21:00,169
Rym: Yeah for sure.

332
00:21:00,651 --> 00:21:01,635
Rym: I still remember one.

333
00:21:01,675 --> 00:21:03,140
Rym: so that was you were playing.

334
00:21:03,181 --> 00:21:16,182
Rym: we were playing like music where people were coming into a PAX panel and Tiger played and we had like three different people email us after the panel to be like, you know, the panel was good, but whatever What the fuck was that sound song you played?

335
00:21:16,584 --> 00:21:18,230
Rym: that wasn't quite eye of the tiger.

336
00:21:18,912 --> 00:21:20,980
Scott: Oh, there's also the 300 megabytes one.

337
00:21:21,221 --> 00:21:25,558
Rym: Oh, yeah, QVC person selling the computer Oh, but there's lots of problems.

338
00:21:25,598 --> 00:21:34,543
Scott: They're actually all really good like yeah but anyway, so You know whenever someone who just puts out the hits right puts out the hits here.

339
00:21:34,563 --> 00:21:45,518
Scott: It comes three years in the making Mouth dreams, there is a small trailer video you can watch but by the time you hear this The whole thing will be out for you to go listen to.

340
00:21:45,618 --> 00:21:46,120
Scott: so there you go.

341
00:21:48,311 --> 00:21:52,705
Scott: Just go listen to that album on repeat for however long the website has.

342
00:21:52,905 --> 00:21:56,909
Rym: every time he releases one of these albums He always makes a website with some sort of animated gif thing.

343
00:21:57,451 --> 00:22:03,327
Rym: But this one captures the aesthetic of a geocities page that is under construction.

344
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:06,555
Scott: Yep One other thing is that you know.

345
00:22:07,337 --> 00:22:09,323
Scott: on my Twitter it's just been a we.

346
00:22:09,383 --> 00:22:16,990
Scott: I love it the most when I see The different internet communities of you know, different cultures coming together, right?

347
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,743
Scott: Cuz that's sort of what GeekNights is all about right?

348
00:22:18,783 --> 00:22:21,737
Scott: We got we got their tech We got your gaming we get your anime, right?

349
00:22:22,199 --> 00:22:25,070
Scott: But when I look around at other communities, they're focused on one thing.

350
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,779
Scott: It's like oh I look at those people over there.

351
00:22:27,161 --> 00:22:28,085
Scott: They're anime people.

352
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:28,950
Scott: That's all they are.

353
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:48,190
Scott: They go deeper on anime than we do way deep and I appreciate that and that's why I pay attention to them And I see what they're up to to get my anime feed, but you know sure they play some video games But they're not talking about like, you know Pareto frontiers over there video games, you know, they're playing fall guys in between their animes, right?

354
00:22:49,977 --> 00:22:50,279
Scott: You know.

355
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,104
Scott: and yeah, they're talking.

356
00:22:51,164 --> 00:22:52,190
Scott: I got computers over there.

357
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:56,010
Scott: Maybe they're trying to buy a video card or something, but they're anime people.

358
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,153
Scott: They're not you know.

359
00:22:57,233 --> 00:23:02,970
Scott: rendering videos and programming anything in C and using CUDA cores to you know, do it, right?

360
00:23:04,494 --> 00:23:06,130
Scott: And the same thing goes right in the tech community.

361
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:09,210
Scott: Yeah, they might watch an anime, but they're not anime people they're tech people.

362
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:21,010
Scott: But when it comes to if you look at the tweet Right announcing this album in the replies because you see I see replies When I follow both sides of the reply, that's how Twitter works, right?

363
00:23:21,831 --> 00:23:34,229
Scott: I've seen everyone from like New York Rangers podcasters to like video game developers Comic book people like the web community is pretty deep in there.

364
00:23:34,991 --> 00:23:42,774
Scott: yeah, like all these people across the spectrum of nerds and good human beings are all up and like Like.

365
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:44,259
Scott: where has this album been.

366
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,283
Scott: give it to me now?

367
00:23:45,403 --> 00:23:46,487
Scott: Why do I have to wait?

368
00:23:46,568 --> 00:23:47,150
Scott: Oh my you're right.

369
00:23:47,271 --> 00:23:49,389
Scott: It's like, you know Neil is like the great.

370
00:23:49,892 --> 00:23:53,030
Scott: He's like the secret, you know cultural phenomenon.

371
00:23:53,371 --> 00:23:57,670
Rym: He's one of the most prolific memetic artists in human history.

372
00:23:58,071 --> 00:23:58,814
Scott: Well, I don't think it's his.

373
00:23:59,055 --> 00:24:01,604
Scott: I don't think it's really his prolific miss cuz.

374
00:24:01,624 --> 00:24:03,230
Scott: he actually doesn't put out lots of stuff.

375
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:17,783
Scott: It's that he hits so many home runs and usually the people we seeing hitting so many home runs are people who are like, you know have like a formula and a focus like we talk about people like You know

376
00:24:18,893 --> 00:24:22,330
Rym: Well like science Saru and they're just cranking out these anime movies like everyone.

377
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:24,760
Scott: It's just gonna be every single anime movie they make.

378
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:35,950
Scott: you know Miyazaki at least and not his son, but Good movie Right, you know, it's like certain people but they're they're making one kind of thing and they make it over and over.

379
00:24:36,171 --> 00:24:39,121
Scott: Neil makes lots of different kinds of things.

380
00:24:39,402 --> 00:24:48,247
Scott: He doesn't make them on a big Hollywood Level right with big budgets, but he hits the core like the core is perfect every time.

381
00:24:48,267 --> 00:24:51,770
Scott: and that core He hits hits all the nerds.

382
00:24:52,111 --> 00:24:54,037
Scott: It doesn't hit some of the hits everybody.

383
00:24:54,318 --> 00:24:58,350
Scott: and then in our culture of millennial and perhaps younger nerder?

384
00:24:58,372 --> 00:25:11,321
Rym: Yeah like you look you go back through like his body of work and you're like wait the same guy who made like Potter puppet pals made mouthmoods and Lemon demon the band what it's like.

385
00:25:11,341 --> 00:25:12,826

Scott: I'm just gonna listen to this album I'm sure that's what I'm gonna do and then and then two evenings from now listen to that album in my x-wing.

408
00:26:23,213 --> 00:26:24,258
Scott: X-wings have stereos, right?

409
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,102
Rym: I assume so.

410
00:26:25,866 --> 00:26:30,480
Scott: Yeah My thing is actually are to play Neil Cicierega.

411
00:26:30,721 --> 00:26:30,902
Scott: Yeah.

412
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:33,930
Rym: So this is more topical to the world being on fire.

413
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:34,454
Rym: It's a comic.

414
00:26:34,796 --> 00:26:35,481
Rym: I'll just link to it.

415
00:26:36,126 --> 00:26:36,590
Rym: Nate Powell.

416
00:26:37,492 --> 00:26:39,405
Rym: It's all one long web page.

417
00:26:39,445 --> 00:26:40,190
Rym: You scroll down.

418
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:46,493
Rym: It's just a comic that just goes on and on and on all the way down to the bottom and what it's about is A lot of things.

419
00:26:46,914 --> 00:27:10,731
Rym: but it basically at the top level talks about how the way military clothing is and police clothing is in the United States like the uniforms they wear and the perceptions of those uniforms and the codes around them and the intersection with white supremacy and the rise of like paramilitary nonsense and fascists in the United States and Sort of.

420
00:27:10,811 --> 00:27:17,430
Rym: shows this like very slow and methodical progression toward where we are now in a really fascinating way.

421
00:27:17,791 --> 00:27:22,070
Rym: This comic might make you think it's a somewhat disturbing and frightening comic.

422
00:27:22,532 --> 00:27:33,030
Rym: That's on purpose because it's a disturbing and frightening world right now But I highly recommend you read this comic all the way to the bottom Even if you are made uncomfortable by some of the things that it's talking about.

423
00:27:33,512 --> 00:27:41,088
Rym: I think it'll hit home in particular if you have police officers or Military people in your family because you'll be much more familiar with some of these things.

424
00:27:42,554 --> 00:27:45,535
Rym: Okay At a moment GeekNights.

425
00:27:45,896 --> 00:27:52,317
Rym: We're gonna be live today and yet another con this weekend on Saturday 7 p.m Pacific time 10 p.m.

426
00:27:52,397 --> 00:27:52,999
Rym: Eastern Time.

427
00:27:53,381 --> 00:27:54,505
Rym: play dirty to win.

428
00:27:54,866 --> 00:28:01,285
Rym: We took us 55 Fifty nine point five nine panel and we scrunched it down to 24 minutes and 37 seconds.

429
00:28:01,586 --> 00:28:05,213
Rym: and That's it.

430
00:28:05,293 --> 00:28:07,288
Rym: It's gonna be in the main mag vest twitch stream.

431
00:28:08,112 --> 00:28:12,526
Rym: We will be hanging out in that stream in some capacity answering questions and doing whatever.

432
00:28:12,927 --> 00:28:13,630
Rym: It'll be a good time.

433
00:28:14,011 --> 00:28:21,589
Rym: You should check out the rest of what mag West 2020 online has to offer because can't go to a real con Might as well go to an online con.

434
00:28:23,552 --> 00:28:50,629
Scott: And also unless something happens to me that I do not know is gonna happen because life is unpredictable like that We will read the tale of Genji point some day and then we will discuss it in an episode on this show that will be probably not get that many downloads or anything, but we'll simply get a lot of laughs and jeers and sarcastic quips from the listener Because we finally we finally did it.

435
00:28:51,951 --> 00:28:55,990
Rym: Just do not do not think that we are not reading the tale of Genji because we're reading other things.

436
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:57,629
Rym: We're just not reading right now.

437
00:28:57,971 --> 00:28:59,074
Rym: This is not the world.

438
00:28:59,234 --> 00:28:59,656
Scott: the last

439
00:28:59,696 --> 00:28:59,856
Rym: time

440
00:28:59,876 --> 00:29:05,034
Scott: the last book the last book that I have read a page of was the tale of Genji,

441
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:15,241
Rym: so yep, the last Fiction book that I've read a page of the tale of Genji I've been reading nonfiction but that is because that is in the service of either GeekNights projects or role-playing games.

442
00:29:17,324 --> 00:29:24,286
Rym: I Read a big chunk of blades in the dark because we just started a new blades in the dark.

443
00:29:24,487 --> 00:29:26,015
Scott: board game rulebooks Don't count either.

444
00:29:26,318 --> 00:29:27,849
Rym: No, those are definitely do not count.

445
00:29:28,731 --> 00:29:37,767
Rym: I've been referencing the 1882 rulebook to double-check some things that I forgot and I was wrong about a rule that I wasn't thinking about in my head that I should have paid more attention to.

446
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,194
Scott: but anyway I'm not.

447
00:29:39,314 --> 00:29:40,340
Scott: I am not good at that one.

448
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:46,166
Scott: I am okay at that one That says I think it's the 18xx game.

449
00:29:46,186 --> 00:29:46,790
Scott: I am worst at.

450
00:29:49,306 --> 00:29:52,310
Scott: So Yeah, I got too used to that the speedy ones the slow one kills.

451
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:56,710
Scott: Yeah, the first time any ones I wanted us it's like when they were playing the speedy ones.

452
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:58,436
Scott: I was like too fast slow down.

453
00:29:58,497 --> 00:30:01,970
Scott: Let me work my two trains and then it's like oh you want to slow down, huh?

454
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,928
Scott: And I'm like, no, I mean the one.

455
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:09,530
Rym: now We're in stock around five and there's still two three trades for fucking sale.

456
00:30:10,731 --> 00:30:12,401
Scott: Yeah, it's it's.

457
00:30:12,502 --> 00:30:13,790

00:30:14,492 --> 00:30:15,214
Scott: I got no idea.

459
00:30:15,736 --> 00:30:17,843
Rym: if I float FC, you know SC, you know, what happens?

460
00:30:18,405 --> 00:30:19,849
Rym: a third three train appears.

461
00:30:24,331 --> 00:30:25,616
Rym: That'll make sure the D never comes out.

00:30:25,917 --> 00:30:27,764
Rym: so yeah follow Scott on YouTube.

Rym: we're doing stuff.

465
00:30:29,651 --> 00:30:34,670
Rym: We're not gonna talk about some of the projects we're working on until we actually do them because they might fail like I don't know.

466
00:30:35,223 --> 00:30:36,813
Rym: so Stay tuned.

467
00:30:36,833 --> 00:30:37,697
Rym: We're working on stuff.

468
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:43,838
Rym: and now I guess it's just time to talk about Thundercats cuz We never talked about Thundercats at any point.

469
00:30:43,918 --> 00:30:46,970
Rym: at most we did a show once about the shows we watched as kids.

470
00:30:47,391 --> 00:30:55,375
Rym: I'm sure we mentioned Thundercats at some point in that but we definitely did not dwell on Thundercats Mm-hmm.

471
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:56,761
Scott: So Thundercats for me.

472
00:30:56,781 --> 00:31:02,099
Scott: It's like you think about the the big 80s Toy selling cartoons that I watched.

473
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:09,649
Scott: a lot of right and you know, you get your human You got your Voltron you got your this GI Joe, but I didn't really watch that so much.

474
00:31:10,073 --> 00:31:11,629
Rym: I watched a lot of GI Joe.

475
00:31:12,514 --> 00:31:13,426
Scott: Yeah, I only watched a little bit.

476
00:31:15,651 --> 00:31:17,158
Scott: Thundercats and what was the last one?

477
00:31:17,339 --> 00:31:17,881
Scott: transformers?

478
00:31:17,901 --> 00:31:23,203
Scott: Yeah, obviously she was like the big Yeah, but I'm talking about like, you know, the cheer.

479
00:31:23,243 --> 00:31:24,149
Scott: I wasn't as popular

480
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:27,143
Rym: Popular I want to say

481
00:31:28,593 --> 00:31:30,461
Scott: Yeah, anyway, there's a now there

482
00:31:30,481 --> 00:31:37,442
Rym: was a limited set of like mass mainstream Mainstream kind of bad animated kids show from our

483
00:31:37,622 --> 00:31:40,469
Scott: action adventure, you know violent ones

484
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:43,195
Rym: Like there's all these

485
00:31:43,516 --> 00:31:52,450
Scott: other sci-fi robots warriors soldiers, you know stereotypically Masculine in some way kind of thing.

486
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:58,047
Rym: There were a lot of second tier ones that all had niche audiences like mask or I guess bionicles.

487
00:31:58,067 --> 00:32:01,230
Rym: that might have been a little later even Bad ago, I think was way later.

488
00:32:01,291 --> 00:32:03,996
Rym: I think it was later But there were all those detail shows.

489
00:32:04,036 --> 00:32:12,209
Rym: but Thundercats was one of the a-tier shows for like when we were in the 80s as kids And not early 90s you go and you're in your elementary school or middle school.

490
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:19,843
Rym: Every kid knows the deal with Thundercats, even if they do not I don't know if Ghostbusters counts in the same category or not.

491
00:32:19,923 --> 00:32:21,149
Scott: But anyway, I think I would.

492
00:32:21,169 --> 00:32:22,218
Rym: I don't know I don't think it does.

493
00:32:22,238 --> 00:32:26,678
Scott: I mean I'll say no huge show doesn't care Ninja Turtles.

494
00:32:26,958 --> 00:32:29,185
Scott: Yeah Turtles was 90s though Ninja Turtles was night.

495
00:32:29,205 --> 00:32:30,930
Rym: Yeah, we're talking 80s right here.

496
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:31,593
Scott: We're talking right?

497
00:32:31,613 --> 00:32:39,850
Scott: So basically the things that were like post set like post Hanna-barbera pre Ninja Turtles that that's the zone right anyway.

498
00:32:40,995 --> 00:32:46,322
Scott: See it for me at least Thundercats was actually like the biggest one.

499
00:32:47,345 --> 00:32:55,003
Scott: I think I actually liked Aesthetically Transformers Voltron more but I had less access to them right.

500
00:32:55,244 --> 00:33:00,200
Scott: the Voltron toy was very expensive And my parents did not buy it.

501
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:05,419
Scott: for me, even though my friend had it He-man right was a little bit too early.

502
00:33:05,479 --> 00:33:09,170
Scott: So I had plenty he-man toys, but I didn't have like the big castle, right?

503
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:10,496
Scott: I didn't wanted a castle gray skull.

504
00:33:10,516 --> 00:33:10,999
Scott: I didn't have.

505
00:33:11,019 --> 00:33:13,230
Rym: well, you know, I was bigger like he-man.

506
00:33:13,371 --> 00:33:16,043
Rym: I was a kid like weird like big big into.

507
00:33:16,063 --> 00:33:17,570
Rym: that was my primary show.

508
00:33:17,691 --> 00:33:23,128
Scott: I had a lot of he-man toys But I just didn't get to watch a lot of he-man because he just wasn't on TV.

509
00:33:23,148 --> 00:33:23,530
Scott: a lot.

510
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:30,550
Scott: It's like, you know, it's like I was still playing with he-man toys But I was hardly watching and he-man because it was not even I was watching a lot of he-man.

511
00:33:30,851 --> 00:33:32,920
Rym: I guess it was just in syndication and where I grew right.

512
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,005
Scott: you're you're a victim.

513
00:33:34,025 --> 00:33:38,091
Scott: in those days You were a victim of your local syndicators.

514
00:33:38,172 --> 00:33:39,736
Scott: what programs they chose to run?

515
00:33:39,996 --> 00:33:40,237
Scott: right.

516
00:33:40,598 --> 00:33:41,801
Scott: so it's like they.

517
00:33:41,821 --> 00:33:43,105
Scott: you know Voltron.

518
00:33:43,165 --> 00:33:46,053
Scott: it's like I was able to watch some Voltron but Not that much I was.

519
00:33:46,073 --> 00:33:59,950
Scott: you know transformers disappeared from the airwaves until I think eventually sci-fi channel started running it rarely Occasionally, it wasn't until like transformers DVDs came out when we were in college that like I could watch transformers again.

520
00:34:01,031 --> 00:34:08,469
Scott: Yeah, but Thundercats was very syndicated where I lived and I watched a lot of it and I have a lot of memories attached.

521
00:34:08,652 --> 00:34:13,362
Scott: I actually had you know The cat's lair toy with the flashlight in the head didn't my?

522
00:34:13,382 --> 00:34:15,416
Scott: I think it's still in my attic somewhere I don't know.

523
00:34:15,436 --> 00:34:16,129
Scott: Maybe it's gone now.

524
00:34:16,292 --> 00:34:17,731
Rym: I had Lionel's sword like.

525
00:34:17,771 --> 00:34:20,581
Rym: I know I had a toy like that and so I had.

526
00:34:20,701 --> 00:34:25,969
Scott: I had a. I had a mumra where there would be a Little thing and you spin it around and he'd switch between forms.

527
00:34:26,612 --> 00:34:31,045
Scott: I had you know a lot of thought I think at almost every Thundercats actually, you know, it's crazy.

528
00:34:31,105 --> 00:34:32,289
Scott: I had no extra.

529
00:34:32,329 --> 00:34:35,155
Scott: I had Star Lionel.

530
00:34:35,175 --> 00:34:35,839
Scott: I had a snarf.

531
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:36,924
Scott: the snarf didn't move.

532
00:34:36,984 --> 00:34:38,050
Scott: It was just like a figurine.

533
00:34:38,311 --> 00:34:40,842
Scott: I didn't have Wiley cat and kit.

534
00:34:40,882 --> 00:34:41,446
Scott: I didn't have them.

535
00:34:41,466 --> 00:34:42,168
Scott: I'd have the kids.

536
00:34:42,591 --> 00:34:44,197
Rym: So my weird accounting of my childhood.

537
00:34:44,357 --> 00:34:50,610
Rym: I had all the action figures for he-man like every action figure And but I didn't have any like life-size toys.

538
00:34:50,971 --> 00:34:57,210
Rym: But for Thundercats, I had like Lionel's sword and like play hit your brother kind of toys.

539
00:34:57,632 --> 00:35:00,510
Rym: But I did not have any action figures not one.

540
00:35:00,613 --> 00:35:08,610
Scott: Yep panthe rose action figures really good because he has this little sort of like Cat nunchucks and he actually like his arms have action so he can nunchuck around.

541
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:09,633
Scott: It's all cool.

542
00:35:09,653 --> 00:35:11,720
Rym: my friend Joe Ogilvy had that those toys.

543
00:35:12,001 --> 00:35:13,526
Scott: I actually remember like the day.

544
00:35:13,586 --> 00:35:15,332
Scott: My brother was born Right.

545
00:35:15,352 --> 00:35:20,490
Scott: I think my dad came to pick me up at like the nursery school and gave me Lionel action figure.

546
00:35:21,192 --> 00:35:22,977
Scott: Anyway, that was most of in 1986.

547
00:35:22,977 --> 00:35:27,168
Rym: what someone's selling the Thundercats sort of omens with the working for 500 bucks.

548
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:34,068
Scott: No, I could just get a new one or make one for the cosplayer can make a better one Exactly the one I had.

549
00:35:35,111 --> 00:35:35,773
Scott: Yeah, that's boy.

550
00:35:35,793 --> 00:35:36,396
Scott: There was only one.

551
00:35:36,416 --> 00:35:36,998
Scott: It wasn't.

552
00:35:37,259 --> 00:35:38,745
Rym: looks like there was a later one.

553
00:35:38,785 --> 00:35:39,809
Rym: That's slightly fancier.

554
00:35:41,031 --> 00:35:43,558
Scott: Okay, so Thundercats right was this TV series.

555
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:44,561
Scott: It had a few seasons.

556
00:35:45,123 --> 00:35:48,208
Scott: You saw as much as you could in the day when it was syndicated.

557
00:35:49,031 --> 00:35:51,722
Scott: Then there was like a remake much later in the 2000s.

558
00:35:51,803 --> 00:35:59,150
Scott: Like we were already living in Beacon I think at the time or even later, maybe you were already living in New York that I remember being really excited about.

559
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:00,750
Rym: We were already in New York talked about it.

560
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:09,134
Scott: We talked about it on this show and we watched a little bit and then we're like meh because honestly I remember it was Crazy boring.

561
00:36:09,314 --> 00:36:15,596
Rym: after the first few episodes like it started so strong and then it just got so boring that I didn't I just stop Watching it.

562
00:36:15,617 --> 00:36:16,246
Rym: I just didn't care.

563
00:36:17,057 --> 00:36:19,853
Rym: Yeah, like the characters Didn't go.

564
00:36:19,893 --> 00:36:20,034
Scott: Yep.

565
00:36:20,315 --> 00:36:25,690
Scott: There's a new thing relatively new Thundercats roar, which is basically the same thing as Teen Titans go only Thundercats.

566
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:26,615
Scott: I really want to watch it.

567
00:36:26,655 --> 00:36:27,118
Scott: I just haven't.

568
00:36:27,138 --> 00:36:31,960
Rym: yet I'd same because I am Actually, honestly a big fan of Teen Titans.

569
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:40,168
Rym: go I do enjoy that kind of Comedic dense like weird zoomed in super deformed nonsense version of a show.

570
00:36:40,188 --> 00:36:43,550
Scott: Yep Okay, so what's the deal with the original Thundercats?

571
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:48,830
Scott: So the thing about the original Thundercats is that you know people could argue about whether it's anime or not, right?

572
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:52,824
Scott: I think some Japanese people did some work on it to some extent right.

573
00:36:53,285 --> 00:37:00,018
Scott: but in that Despite being a Show for American television, right?

574
00:37:00,038 --> 00:37:04,190
Scott: It was originally, you know, the original language of the show is English, right?

575
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,209
Scott: It's for an English audience.

576
00:37:06,732 --> 00:37:08,038
Scott: It's not like it was dubbed over.

577
00:37:08,058 --> 00:37:10,850
Scott: Yeah, some original Japanese dialogue or anything.

578
00:37:12,113 --> 00:37:16,430
Scott: Is that it actually has a somewhat serial plot?

579
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:19,670
Scott: It's not just some episodic thing, right?

580
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:23,846
Scott: Transformers also has the serial plot and sort of I get but not as much.

581
00:37:23,886 --> 00:37:24,910
Scott: Thundercats actually has more.

582
00:37:26,316 --> 00:37:31,290
Scott: You know, I think Thundercats Transformers some of the episodes engage in the serial plot, right?

583
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:33,375
Scott: But most of them are just like up.

584
00:37:33,736 --> 00:37:36,384
Scott: there goes Megatron stealing some energon cubes.

585
00:37:36,424 --> 00:37:36,745
Scott: fight him.

586
00:37:37,186 --> 00:37:37,487
Scott: Yeah.

587
00:37:37,727 --> 00:37:40,476
Scott: Okay the end Oh, he's you know who it's.

588
00:37:40,536 --> 00:37:44,610
Scott: and it's pretty much like well, which Autobots are gonna fight Megatron this time.

589
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:47,365
Scott: Oh, there's a new Decepticon stealing energon cubes.

590
00:37:47,405 --> 00:37:48,270
Scott: It's a different toy.

591
00:37:48,711 --> 00:37:51,079
Scott: Alright, which toys are gonna fight over the energon cubes?

592
00:37:51,279 --> 00:37:52,403
Scott: just episodic nothing.

593
00:37:52,543 --> 00:37:55,772
Scott: and Thundercats does have a lot of episodic Nothings.

594
00:37:55,872 --> 00:37:57,176
Scott: right monster of the week, right?

595
00:37:57,197 --> 00:38:01,010
Scott: So there's like the burbles which are basically robot ewoks that live in the woods.

596
00:38:02,072 --> 00:38:04,586
Scott: It's like well, the mutants are attacking the burbles again, right?

597
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:09,549
Scott: Guess the Thundercats are gonna roll out in their Thunder tank and save them, you know.

598
00:38:10,231 --> 00:38:14,866
Scott: But like the second season of Thundercats is like it starts with like a six-parter.

599
00:38:15,006 --> 00:38:16,170
Scott: That's like sort of like a movie.

600
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:17,213
Scott: I think it's six parts.

601
00:38:17,574 --> 00:38:20,963
Scott: the start of Thundercats the well, there's the 1986 movie.

602
00:38:21,123 --> 00:38:23,188
Rym: after season one just Thundercats.

603
00:38:23,209 --> 00:38:27,504
Scott: Oh Yeah, well, that's the start of that's broken up into episodes.

604
00:38:27,545 --> 00:38:28,910
Scott: That's the start of season two.

605
00:38:30,212 --> 00:38:32,161
Scott: The season one starts with a multi-parter.

606
00:38:32,281 --> 00:38:34,150
Scott: That's the start of Thundercats, right?

607
00:38:34,811 --> 00:38:40,515
Scott: And while there are lots of episodes that are just fight a bad guy It's like the last season.

608
00:38:40,535 --> 00:38:46,757
Scott: they're actually like leaving the planet and going to New Thundera and leaving, you know I never got that far.

609
00:38:47,561 --> 00:38:51,179
Scott: I only saw those episodes on Toonami later in the day.

610
00:38:51,219 --> 00:38:57,118
Scott: They didn't syndicate those episodes where I lived Talk about the the problem of syndication.

611
00:38:57,158 --> 00:39:03,199
Rym: for me part of the reason why I was so much more into he-man Was that we got the episodes reliably.

612
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:06,410
Rym: Thundercats was either aired out of order or weird time.

613
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:12,789
Rym: So I saw Thundercats in such a like broken order that I couldn't find any plot thread.

614
00:39:12,869 --> 00:39:14,735
Scott: as a kid I had I had VHS.

615
00:39:14,755 --> 00:39:17,021
Scott: So I knew the plot and the thing about Thundercats.

616
00:39:17,222 --> 00:39:25,087
Scott: that I think is not just that it was serialized right is that There's a lot of things that like as a kid.

617
00:39:25,147 --> 00:39:30,890
Scott: as a kid I had them confused in my mind because Thundercats stole from them, right?

618
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:36,570
Scott: So if you think about it, right Thundercats has so much fucking Star Wars in it, right?

619
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:39,929
Scott: It's like, you know obi-wan appears to Luke is like a ghost.

620
00:39:40,451 --> 00:39:45,670
Scott: Right as a kid I was confused cuz you had Jaga appearing as a ghost to lino, right?

621
00:39:47,231 --> 00:39:52,206
Scott: Was basically just Emperor Palpatine Sort sort of mum rise a little different.

622
00:39:52,227 --> 00:39:52,630
Scott: well depends.

623
00:39:53,713 --> 00:39:58,527
Scott: Mumra invokes and I already mentioned the the burbles that are straight-up ewoks.

624
00:39:58,948 --> 00:39:59,409
Scott: Mmm, right?

625
00:40:00,573 --> 00:40:13,327
Scott: You have the the that same sort of Relationship between the mutants and Mumra that you have between Starscream and Megatron where it's sort of like the bad guys that don't get along right?

626
00:40:13,507 --> 00:40:14,470
Rym: He man had that too.

627
00:40:15,612 --> 00:40:22,090
Scott: Yep, you have this sort of like, you know Superman story, right?

628
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:29,030
Scott: So the story of Superman is that you know He comes in a and a. he's escaping an exploding planet and crash lands on earth, right?

629
00:40:29,391 --> 00:40:34,467
Scott: Well lino and all the Thundercats are escaping it exploding Thundera and crashing on.

630
00:40:34,808 --> 00:40:36,486
Scott: you know What's the?

631
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:40,141
Rym: Trying to find the name of this place.

632
00:40:40,242 --> 00:40:41,109
Rym: I do not remember.

633
00:40:42,011 --> 00:40:45,180
Scott: Yeah, they think or maybe Thunder is the planet they land on.

634
00:40:45,621 --> 00:40:48,008
Scott: and but no they Thunder is the one.

635
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:50,109
Rym: I thought you were a fan of Thundercats.

636
00:40:50,756 --> 00:40:52,229
Rym: Thunder is the planet that was dying.

637
00:40:52,971 --> 00:40:56,070
Scott: Yes, they knew Thunder is the one they go to in season four.

638
00:40:56,471 --> 00:40:59,584
Scott: What's the one that they that most of Thundercats takes place on?

639
00:40:59,645 --> 00:40:59,765
Scott: where?

640
00:40:59,805 --> 00:41:00,910
Rym: I'm trying to figure that out.

641
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:03,963
Rym: There are a lot of proper nouns in this Wikipedia article.

642
00:41:04,345 --> 00:41:08,772
Scott: there sure are Right, but that's it's like Superman Plus.

643
00:41:08,792 --> 00:41:16,265
Scott: you got this kid lino who's very young and they're in suspended animation when they're flying from the you know exploding Thundera.

644
00:41:17,832 --> 00:41:27,750
Scott: And then when they land lino's in a way older body But it's still a kid in mind and heart and he sort of grows up emotionally Right, even though he's like a kid in an adult's body.

645
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:30,099
Scott: So that's the kid in an adult's body story.

646
00:41:30,139 --> 00:41:33,090
Scott: you saw several times in that in that big, right?

647
00:41:33,814 --> 00:41:42,798
Rym: So as a kid I had no idea that was a thing because I never saw any of the like plot set up episodes Until I only had that because I had v8.

648
00:41:42,858 --> 00:41:46,630
Scott: I only had VHS of that beginning part that I was able to see it.

649
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:53,208
Rym: Yep, all I knew was oh the Thundercats live on this planet and they're fighting with the mutants of plundar and there's a mummy guy And that's that's it.

650
00:41:54,191 --> 00:41:59,349
Scott: Even as a kid I was wondering how come the adult Thundercats didn't get older and suspended animation lion.

651
00:41:59,409 --> 00:42:05,670
Scott: Oh did You've got some you know, and it's like all that serious kind of stuff, right?

652
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:08,829
Scott: You also have a lot of sci-fi kind of plots like space plots.

653
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:22,596
Scott: You know, there's like that are similar to like some Voltron ish Star Trek stuff almost right of like things they encounter in space or you know, People from space that happen to come and appear.

654
00:42:22,636 --> 00:42:33,834
Scott: and you know You got fantasy sort of like holy grail kind of stories like Lionel goes like a vision quest out in the mountains by himself Kind of stuff right to consult with the the sword of omens.

655
00:42:34,014 --> 00:42:35,318
Rym: Yeah, but that was the one thing.

656
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:41,254
Rym: that's all magical artifacts even not seeing enough plot like not knowing what the actual plot was.

657
00:42:41,595 --> 00:42:59,700
Rym: as a kid part of what I liked about Thundercats compared to He-Man and everything else that I was watching was that The characters did seem to grow and change and there was a relatively rich world that was implied by things I saw in episodes as opposed to He-Man where everything's just empty and barren and like.

658
00:43:00,522 --> 00:43:02,008
Rym: There was nothing like as far as I was concerned.

659
00:43:02,028 --> 00:43:04,799
Rym: as a kid Castle Grayskull didn't exist because they never did anything with it.

660
00:43:05,605 --> 00:43:06,900
Rym: They never followed those threads.

661
00:43:07,261 --> 00:43:15,190
Rym: But like these characters were rich enough even to my kid brain to where I like had this impression that there was other Thundercats I hadn't seen.

662
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:16,859
Rym: that would explain a bunch of stuff.

663
00:43:17,341 --> 00:43:19,712
Rym: And as a kid, I was actually weirdly obsessed with Sarah.

664
00:43:19,732 --> 00:43:20,797
Scott: They're just really far away.

665
00:43:20,817 --> 00:43:32,100
Rym: Yeah but like I wanted to know more about the world and about like Where they were going like a kid brain was starting to figure out that I wanted to watch serials.

666
00:43:32,861 --> 00:43:36,240
Scott: Yeah, I mean transformers also had the world building with the Cybertron and stuff.

667
00:43:36,762 --> 00:43:41,260
Scott: It's just a lot of transformers doesn't use that world building except for like the movie, right?

668
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:45,180
Scott: Thundercats a lot of the episodes maybe like even half of them.

669
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,409
Scott: Maybe I'd say use it and the other half are you know?

670
00:43:48,489 --> 00:43:49,352
Scott: fight Mumra again.

671
00:43:49,713 --> 00:43:50,616
Scott: fight Mumra again.

672
00:43:50,716 --> 00:43:51,578
Scott: Mumra's up to something.

673
00:43:51,598 --> 00:43:52,722
Scott: go fight him Right.

674
00:43:53,163 --> 00:43:54,226
Scott: He goes back to his mummy.

675
00:43:54,286 --> 00:43:58,939
Scott: form the end, you know, whatever fight fight some mutants, you know, okay, go back.

676
00:43:59,481 --> 00:44:00,264
Rym: Yeah, the mutants.

677
00:44:00,284 --> 00:44:00,786
Rym: as a kid.

678
00:44:00,886 --> 00:44:04,298
Rym: I hated the mutants because I always I was like, why are they so dumb?

679
00:44:04,819 --> 00:44:04,960
Rym: why?

680
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:24,370
Scott: Right, so you have this serious sort of serial plot and you're sort of going back and forth with that to the less serious like silly stuff like snarf and mutants and these characters and set pieces that are just sort of like Corny children's television sort of like mixed together.

681
00:44:24,872 --> 00:44:30,400
Scott: So it's almost like if you were watching Star Wars and Star Wars has some corniness already into it, right?

682
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:36,040
Scott: But imagine if like you took the Star Wars Christmas special and cut it and inserted those scenes into Star Wars.

683
00:44:36,162 --> 00:44:37,339
Scott: I made one big law, right?

684
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:40,855
Scott: So it's like you're watching Star Wars and then suddenly it's a scene from the Christmas special.

685
00:44:40,895 --> 00:44:43,302
Scott: then it's a scene from Star Wars Right,

686
00:44:44,846 --> 00:44:57,540
Rym: I remember as a kid like that and it annoyed me the same way that the villains in like I for some reason as a kid I always saw Skeletor as being super competent and I hated all of his minions because they were so bad at this and Thundercats same thing.

687
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:58,807
Rym: It was like Mumra knows what's up.

688
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:01,039
Rym: Why does Mumra get better minions?

689
00:45:03,342 --> 00:45:04,950
Scott: See the thing is about Thundercats.

690
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:06,518
Scott: that actually I thought was really awesome.

691
00:45:06,538 --> 00:45:10,570
Scott: is I think some people don't like think about it too hard.

692
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:12,074
Scott: Is that the real villains?

693
00:45:12,194 --> 00:45:14,320
Scott: are these ancient spirits of evil?

694
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,947
Scott: There's actually like a Cthulhu kind of.

695
00:45:16,988 --> 00:45:19,676
Scott: you know, ask story going on here, right?

696
00:45:19,736 --> 00:45:21,060
Scott: Mumra is just some dude.

697
00:45:21,461 --> 00:45:23,531
Scott: He's the vessel right, right?

698
00:45:23,572 --> 00:45:35,900
Scott: He's just some dude who's like a mummy Who has managed to live for a long time because these four basically elder gods Are keeping him alive with unnatural dark powers.

699
00:45:36,081 --> 00:45:38,349
Rym: He's basically like Zelos from slayers.

700
00:45:38,409 --> 00:45:40,035
Rym: He like pledged himself to them.

701
00:45:40,096 --> 00:45:41,160
Rym: I got that as a kid.

702
00:45:41,824 --> 00:45:42,508
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

703
00:45:42,568 --> 00:45:45,363
Scott: So and it's like he's not strong He's just a mummy.

704
00:45:45,443 --> 00:45:53,940
Scott: if Lino could figure out getting that pyramid, you know, which I think they do try to do on occasion It's like you could just cut up that mummy and be that be it, right?

705
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,350
Scott: But the ancient spirits of evil are so freakin strong.

706
00:45:57,410 --> 00:46:07,500
Scott: They turn Mumra into like, you know, not God's here But we're talking like Hercules tear, you know Like avatar of themselves right because they can't I guess directly interact.

707
00:46:08,125 --> 00:46:17,320
Scott: So it's like they want Mumra to succeed But they also don't trust Mumra entirely because he's right gonna keep over on a short leash because he was definitely an ambitious individual.

708
00:46:18,062 --> 00:46:20,971
Scott: Yeah, and they can't really do things direct like they can't like.

709
00:46:21,272 --> 00:46:24,000
Scott: they can't just kill Lionel directly, right?

710
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:25,329
Scott: It's it they I guess.

711
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:28,519
Scott: they you know, they're they're too Ethereal and far away.

712
00:46:29,084 --> 00:46:30,798
Scott: So all they can really do is you know?

713
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:36,420
Scott: Help Mumra magically almost like he's a cleric of them and he prays and then they get magic, right?

714
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:37,945
Scott: They're not looking too closely.

715
00:46:37,986 --> 00:46:39,772
Scott: They got other shit going on in other places.

716
00:46:40,114 --> 00:46:41,439
Rym: The one thing that did also stand out.

717
00:46:41,479 --> 00:46:44,445
Rym: as a kid I remember I'm always just comparing it to he-man But I always.

718
00:46:44,485 --> 00:46:55,200
Scott: the point is I always want I always wanted to see Like if the show were to go on like, you know They go out into and they find and they fight the ancient spirits of evil this four of them, right?

719
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:58,257
Scott: So like they could find where they are and they would be super creepy.

720
00:46:58,277 --> 00:46:58,860
Scott: They could be a good fam.

721
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,246
Scott: Sure, there's a fanfiction of that right?

722
00:47:00,407 --> 00:47:00,910
Rym: It has to be.

723
00:47:02,201 --> 00:47:04,871
Rym: Is there a Wikipedia article on the Asian spirits of evil?

724
00:47:04,891 --> 00:47:11,244
Rym: Cuz there's a whole Wikipedia article just on Mumra Ancient spirits of evil.

725
00:47:11,264 --> 00:47:12,590
Rym: All right, here's the full story.

726
00:47:12,891 --> 00:47:22,935
Rym: There's there is more lore about them in the later Incarnations of Thundercats that I'm not gonna read to all of you here, but they're basically a bore a vulture a crocodile and an ox.

727
00:47:24,799 --> 00:47:26,946
Rym: I Even picked up on that as a kid.

728
00:47:27,307 --> 00:47:27,970
Rym: I don't think I did.

729
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:28,311
Scott: Yeah.

730
00:47:28,371 --> 00:47:31,020
Scott: Yeah, they're just for generally pagan images.

731
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:34,820
Rym: Yeah, I think it was partly ever said TV broadcasts were really bad.

732
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:42,460
Rym: Like I remember whenever he did the ancient spirits of evil thing The screen was always so dark that that's a tight and may moku shiroku of thunder.

733
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:45,660
Rym: Yeah, but it would kind of pan up to like these vague statues.

734
00:47:45,841 --> 00:47:48,960
Rym: I'm just going from memory here, but it was always so dark that I couldn't see anything.

735
00:47:50,521 --> 00:47:53,840
Scott: Okay, so I I guess I don't know if I had a better TV or yeah.

736
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:56,991
Rym: Maybe it was in the syndication and there was like a worst broadcast.

737
00:47:57,011 --> 00:47:57,794
Rym: Like I have no idea.

738
00:47:57,814 --> 00:47:59,119
Scott: I have no idea.

739
00:48:00,781 --> 00:48:06,160
Scott: But yeah Thundercats, I think you know, I don't haven't watched Thundercats in quite a while years.

740
00:48:06,924 --> 00:48:09,640
Scott: But at the feeling I get is that it would hold up, right?

741
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:17,599
Scott: I could I feel like I could skip over by looking at the episode list on Wikipedia The sort of monster of the week episodes that don't advance the plot at all.

742
00:48:18,001 --> 00:48:19,608
Scott: I just dropped just right.

743
00:48:19,668 --> 00:48:28,219
Scott: just watch the multi-part episodes and the plot Significant episodes and even though there might be some corny things in there like some snarf appearances or whatever, right?

744
00:48:29,682 --> 00:48:31,853
Scott: You know, it's like snarf does have redeeming qualities.

745
00:48:31,893 --> 00:48:35,048
Scott: He's not just completely annoying Yeah, start saves me a few times our fish.

746
00:48:35,229 --> 00:48:37,980
Scott: snarf is way better than Jar Jar Binks by like a million.

747
00:48:38,901 --> 00:48:44,540
Scott: He shares some qualities with Jar Jar Binks type character, but is vastly superior, right?

748
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:52,578
Rym: So one thing I knew as a kid was that the ancient spirits of evil can't like get out of the pyramid So they need mom or how to go out to do stuff.

749
00:48:53,407 --> 00:48:58,814
Rym: yeah, but Apparently in one episode the episode called doom gaze.

750
00:48:59,196 --> 00:49:09,179
Rym: I don't know what that episode was about But apparently there is some lore dropped in the episode that the ancient spirits of evil are Lovecraft's great old ones.

751
00:49:09,502 --> 00:49:11,236
Rym: specifically and on purpose.

752
00:49:11,256 --> 00:49:27,369
Scott: I Mean, I think I always had the feeling that they were in that vein because Marmara invokes in that episode by name to other entities not the And Cthulhu specifically, uh-huh.

753
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:29,856
Rym: So the episode is called doom gaze.

754
00:49:29,976 --> 00:49:32,365
Rym: We might want to watch it Maybe.

755
00:49:32,385 --> 00:49:39,317
Scott: oh, I mean, it's also worth noting The real Ghostbusters has an episode where Cthulhu comes and there's like, you know, yellow sign cultists.

756
00:49:39,398 --> 00:49:52,654
Rym: Yeah Talking about shows that were ahead of their time the Ghostbusters cartoon was the scary like it was like the Owl House today And that that was the level of scary weird that kids actually resonated with.

757
00:49:52,935 --> 00:49:59,776
Rym: I think a lot of parents didn't expect That cartoon to be as weird as it was because body horror played into like 75% of those episodes.

758
00:50:04,481 --> 00:50:06,066
Rym: Yeah, I'm actually getting drawn into this.

759
00:50:06,126 --> 00:50:09,558
Rym: I'm reading the Wikipedia lore to piece together all the stuff.

760
00:50:09,658 --> 00:50:14,100
Rym: as a kid I could not figure out about the Thundercats universe because I saw it in random order.

761
00:50:14,742 --> 00:50:26,793
Scott: and this one thing is I think that this growing up with the Thundercats that had this serial plot that drew upon right Star Wars Superman these other things right?

762
00:50:27,154 --> 00:50:28,680
Scott: It's just so many it by.

763
00:50:29,323 --> 00:50:31,959
Scott: It's like it's actually not very original when you look at it.

764
00:50:32,341 --> 00:50:45,580
Scott: It's like an amalgamation of all the other nerdy types of stories that I'm into and I can tie sort of every almost everything else I like like you can see it in Thundercats and maybe it was I don't know for sure, right?

765
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:48,420
Scott: But I feel like it was sort of this reverse thing.

766
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:48,862
Scott: We're like.

767
00:50:49,002 --> 00:50:53,800
Scott: I was so young watching Thundercats and that made me that you know made me like that.

768
00:50:53,941 --> 00:50:56,240
Scott: So now I like all the things right.

769
00:50:56,392 --> 00:51:08,940
Rym: well you know when I think about that you make a good point because I was born to he-man like at a similar age to you and The thing I was obsessed with in he-man, but the show didn't tell me about was what's the deal with Castle Grayskull?

770
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:12,467
Scott: I wanted to know that too, of course No, but because specifically what's what's?

771
00:51:12,568 --> 00:51:21,431
Rym: one of the primary things that I am like weirdly into to this day specifically is Precursor technology the idea that there is magic.

772
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:24,140
Rym: that is actually science and people just forgot about it.

773
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:28,935
Rym: Thundercats definitely has that under case and he-man both had that in spades.

774
00:51:29,718 --> 00:51:41,699
Scott: Yep Yeah, I think also part of what Thundercats does is that you have this, you know The Thundercats civilization that they leave is like a great civilization just like Krypton and Superman, right?

775
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:43,482
Rym: Though who escaped?

776
00:51:43,502 --> 00:51:47,758
Rym: seems like only five like a few of them escapes like is every other Thundercat dead?

777
00:51:50,142 --> 00:51:52,272
Scott: No, there are some others that are well that survive.

778
00:51:52,433 --> 00:51:53,498
Scott: that you'll see in season four.

779
00:51:54,542 --> 00:51:58,840
Rym: See, I never I never saw those episodes that I don't think I ever saw another Thundercat than the main crew.

780
00:51:59,801 --> 00:52:00,505
Scott: There there's a few.

781
00:52:00,746 --> 00:52:01,529
Rym: I remember snart.

782
00:52:01,549 --> 00:52:03,799
Rym: there was a worse snarf that showed up at one point.

783
00:52:05,001 --> 00:52:06,085
Scott: Yeah, I think that's also.

784
00:52:06,145 --> 00:52:10,139
Rym: I do remember there's just there was a. there was a scrappy do to Scooby Doo.

785
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:11,343
Scott: Yeah, there's like.

786
00:52:11,424 --> 00:52:12,547
Scott: it's like a symbiotic.

787
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:17,672
Scott: I considered like the snarf species is whatever species that is Are they are they snarfs?

788
00:52:17,995 --> 00:52:18,580
Scott: Is that what they are?

789
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:18,981
Scott: I don't know.

790
00:52:19,001 --> 00:52:19,804
Scott: we could be sort of like.

791
00:52:20,206 --> 00:52:23,699
Rym: the snarfs are a race of intelligent cat-like creatures that are plump fuzzy and kind.

792
00:52:23,719 --> 00:52:29,795
Rym: they're Native to Thandara living in the valley of the snarfs and they act as servants to the Thandarian nobility.

793
00:52:29,815 --> 00:52:31,299
Scott: Yeah, that's right.

794
00:52:31,419 --> 00:52:34,404
Rym: Yeah It's okay.

795
00:52:34,866 --> 00:52:38,400
Rym: the one I remembered is literally named snarfer.

796
00:52:39,764 --> 00:52:40,389
Scott: Yep, that's right.

797
00:52:41,034 --> 00:52:43,109
Rym: Snarf's nephew Mm-hmm.

798
00:52:44,321 --> 00:52:58,099
Rym: Okay, so now I'm disturbed because when snarfer appears it was thought that he died when Thandara exploded along with all of the other Snarfs and everyone was surprised that he survived Implying that all the other starts died.

799
00:52:59,184 --> 00:52:59,487
Scott: They did.

800
00:52:59,507 --> 00:53:02,406
Rym: Yeah, so the Thunder Cows Bring their servant class.

801
00:53:02,627 --> 00:53:05,797
Rym: They had a servant class that they left behind on their dying plan.

802
00:53:05,817 --> 00:53:08,647
Scott: It's a no I told you it's a Superman story, right?

803
00:53:08,688 --> 00:53:12,501
Scott: It's like, you know Superman escaped from Krypton on his own in a true thing Right.

804
00:53:12,722 --> 00:53:20,307
Scott: So when they if you watch those first two episodes of Thundercats that I saw many times on VHS You'll see that basically it's lion.

805
00:53:20,448 --> 00:53:22,433
Scott: Oh, it's the Thundercats, you know, lion.

806
00:53:22,473 --> 00:53:31,215
Scott: Oh pan throw, you know the two kids you know our Tigra and snarf and Jaga, you know basically dies.

807
00:53:31,315 --> 00:53:31,616
Scott: He's the.

808
00:53:31,636 --> 00:53:32,880
Scott: he's obi-wan Kenobi, right?

809
00:53:34,361 --> 00:53:37,914
Scott: And it's pretty much just them in suspended animation and no one else.

810
00:53:37,954 --> 00:53:42,447
Scott: No one else can fit in the in the ship And they basically Jaga knows that lion.

811
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:43,991
Scott: Oh is like the chosen one already.

812
00:53:44,011 --> 00:54:01,020
Scott: Okay, and he basically takes the chosen one And he you know, he takes Paul of treaties With these guardians Right and the sword of omens and he sort of you know Gives him advice and he appears as a ghost to help him out and he sends him on his way, right?

813
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:07,339
Scott: So and everyone else, you know and Thundara supposedly bites it until you find out later that some survived right.

814
00:54:07,379 --> 00:54:11,329
Rym: so Apparently at some point I never saw this episode.

815
00:54:11,369 --> 00:54:15,743
Rym: snarf convinces the ancient spirits of evil to power him up and Becomes.

816
00:54:16,246 --> 00:54:17,998
Scott: I never heard I don't remember that.

817
00:54:19,384 --> 00:54:20,053
Rym: Now I'm looking at her.

818
00:54:20,113 --> 00:54:22,688
Scott: Ah Don't remember that one.

819
00:54:22,809 --> 00:54:24,440
Rym: apparently that appears to have happened.

820
00:54:24,781 --> 00:54:27,868
Rym: I fold up a Wikipedia page and now a video.

821
00:54:28,189 --> 00:54:32,440
Rym: snarf is in the temple and there is a super buff hot snarf.

822
00:54:32,784 --> 00:54:33,272
Rym: Who is?

823
00:54:33,536 --> 00:54:33,617
Rym: uh?

824
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:35,345
Rym: Yeah, that was the thing.

825
00:54:35,385 --> 00:54:36,571
Rym: I guess we never slept in episode.

826
00:54:36,933 --> 00:54:37,275
Scott: clip it.

827
00:54:37,395 --> 00:54:38,119
Scott: I never seen that one.

828
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:40,324
Scott: Yep All right, I don't remember it.

829
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:42,731
Rym: season 2 episode 24 hair of the dog.

830
00:54:43,012 --> 00:54:45,880
Rym: snarf convinces the ancient spirits of evil to give him power.

831
00:54:46,927 --> 00:54:47,560
Scott: What that?

832
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:57,406
Rym: That's something that I think is universal to kids shows in the 80s and wasn't and maybe the 90s But it's not a thing anymore.

833
00:54:57,707 --> 00:55:01,504
Rym: kids today when they watch a show they go to the streaming service And they just watch the whole show.

834
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:09,760
Rym: when we were kids like I would see some like set of episodes of Thundercats But other kids in my school saw different episodes.

835
00:55:09,881 --> 00:55:25,507
Rym: so a big part of my interaction with kids when I was growing up was Sharing lore that we each knew to try to figure things out about shows like someone say oh There's the episode where like like we do just now when snarf gets the ancient powers of evil Like.

836
00:55:25,568 --> 00:55:26,559
Rym: you didn't know about that.

837
00:55:27,102 --> 00:55:28,006
Rym: That was like.

838
00:55:28,006 --> 00:55:37,560
Rym: 90% of my interaction with other kids was talking about The shows we were watching and the end the lack of intersection of what episodes we had seen due to different syndication schedules.

839
00:55:38,176 --> 00:55:45,100
Scott: Yeah See I think kids that I talked to is Basically, we wouldn't do that because I don't remember talking about like cartoons or anything with our kids.

840
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:48,131
Scott: We mostly talked about video games and shared, you know tips and things.

841
00:55:48,151 --> 00:55:53,549
Scott: but the problem was is at least so many kids Would basically make stuff up right?

842
00:55:53,609 --> 00:55:57,100
Scott: It's like so there wasn't a lot of trust between oh, you know kids.

843
00:55:57,422 --> 00:56:06,315
Rym: I was about to bring that up because in those interactions kids would make up stuff about these shows that I could not disprove because I had.

844
00:56:06,375 --> 00:56:08,862
Rym: I didn't know I hadn't seen whatever episode they Saw.

845
00:56:09,383 --> 00:56:09,644
Scott: yeah, I was.

846
00:56:09,664 --> 00:56:10,868
Rym: well, there's this kid Billy.

847
00:56:10,889 --> 00:56:12,634
Rym: Well, this is flooding back to me.

848
00:56:13,016 --> 00:56:16,525
Scott: He made up So much at Nintendo.

849
00:56:16,705 --> 00:56:17,086
Scott: Yeah,

850
00:56:17,567 --> 00:56:34,700
Rym: he made up so much stuff about he-man in particular and I believed him for a long time until eventually My thinking who's my dad like some of my family but in my uncle was like no no None of that's true because he'd actually seen all the episodes of he-man and he was like now that kids making shit up.

851
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:35,740
Scott: Hmm.

852
00:56:36,465 --> 00:56:39,140
Scott: I remember, you know kids are making stuff up all the time.

853
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:46,020
Scott: There was a kid in fourth grade who was actually a Japanese kid like his parents, you know moved from Japan to my town.

854
00:56:46,281 --> 00:56:47,693
Scott: He was in the class there.

855
00:56:47,713 --> 00:56:55,699
Scott: He was right Obviously had gone to much better schools in the previous years of his life and was smarter than all of us Except in English, so we didn't talk too much.

856
00:56:56,141 --> 00:57:10,553
Scott: But I remember we did a school activity where you would draw a picture of what you wanted for your holiday gifts for whatever holiday you celebrated and he drew a Super Famicom and we were like you're making that shit up.

857
00:57:10,573 --> 00:57:12,100
Scott: There's no such, right?

858
00:57:13,161 --> 00:57:15,209
Scott: Like there's no right he was making shit.

859
00:57:15,269 --> 00:57:15,671
Scott: It's like.

860
00:57:15,751 --> 00:57:17,940
Scott: no that was the one time a kid wasn't making shit up.

861
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:19,803
Scott: He drew a perfect Super Famicom.

862
00:57:19,863 --> 00:57:20,685
Scott: He tried.

863
00:57:20,745 --> 00:57:21,266
Scott: it's like.

864
00:57:21,286 --> 00:57:23,710
Scott: he knew they existed and we he had never heard of.

865
00:57:24,651 --> 00:57:27,040
Rym: Mostly what kids would make up were crossover episodes.

866
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:27,843
Rym: that never happened.

867
00:57:28,004 --> 00:57:28,145
Rym: like.

868
00:57:28,185 --> 00:57:30,672
Rym: that's what I remember the most Like.

869
00:57:30,752 --> 00:57:33,802
Rym: oh there was the episode where Thundercats and he-man were together.

870
00:57:33,822 --> 00:57:36,110
Rym: like now that didn't happen kid now.

871
00:57:36,412 --> 00:57:41,519
Scott: Yeah, the super the Super Nintendo came out in November of 1990 right so he would.

872
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:43,406
Scott: so it had probably just come out in 1990, right?

873
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:45,212
Scott: So I was.

874
00:57:45,233 --> 00:57:47,585
Scott: I was what eight and I was yeah eight.

875
00:57:47,625 --> 00:57:50,682
Scott: I was like in fourth grade Yeah, so probably in like November of 1990.

876
00:57:50,682 --> 00:57:52,129
Scott: It had just come out.

877
00:57:52,492 --> 00:57:54,890
Scott: He knew about it because he was actually Japanese.

878
00:57:55,494 --> 00:58:03,967
Scott: He wanted it for you know Christmas in December Right, and we didn't even know about it because it didn't come out in the US until August 19 of 91, right?

879
00:58:05,470 --> 00:58:06,760
Scott: So I guess a few months later.

880
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:08,050
Scott: We found out he wasn't bluffing.

881
00:58:08,271 --> 00:58:13,289
Rym: Oh shit Snarf is like twice as tall as Mumra when he gets powered up and beats the shit out of him.

882
00:58:14,515 --> 00:58:15,185
Scott: No, pretty cool.

883
00:58:16,692 --> 00:58:21,010
Rym: They also draw him differently in every scene, but that's just how the animation was on TV back then.

884
00:58:22,051 --> 00:58:25,301
Scott: I'm saying is that Thundercats is like has a lot of redeeming qualities.

885
00:58:25,361 --> 00:58:28,150
Scott: It's not just like garbage unwatchable like he-man.

886
00:58:28,275 --> 00:58:28,811
Scott: Oh, yeah Like.

887
00:58:28,871 --> 00:58:35,210
Rym: I'd like the fact that I was so into he-man as a kid that that is just a product of blood syndication of my area.

888
00:58:35,290 --> 00:58:46,462
Scott: He-man is objectively one of the worst kid shows from that era from and I think even I think even your shows like mask Which probably had much better toys than Thundercats, which just had action figures, right?

889
00:58:46,482 --> 00:58:48,448
Scott: It's probably not as good as Thundercats.

890
00:58:48,528 --> 00:58:54,006
Scott: Oh, definitely Transformers I think is like is arguable, but you have to.

891
00:58:54,106 --> 00:58:56,919
Scott: there's so much more Transformers I think you would have to like.

892
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:00,758
Rym: I've admitted this on the show before it was a long time ago But I will admit as a kid.

893
00:59:00,778 --> 00:59:02,910
Rym: I did not actually like transformers.

894
00:59:03,992 --> 00:59:07,267
Scott: I mean, you know, it depends what transformers you saw how old you were when you saw it.

895
00:59:07,368 --> 00:59:09,375
Scott: Yeah It's just what transformer is.

896
00:59:09,415 --> 00:59:12,946
Scott: definitely is the king of toys like a transforming toy.

897
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:13,929
Scott: It's like you couldn't beat that.

898
00:59:14,371 --> 00:59:18,730
Rym: Yep, I think that's why I was so into mask because the mask toys transform so much better.

899
00:59:18,890 --> 00:59:23,550
Rym: Yeah, and my like of the show was a hundred percent from my like of the toys not the other way around.

900
00:59:24,379 --> 00:59:32,849
Rym: Yeah Anyway, yeah, but no Thundercats holds up better than a lot of those shows from that era and I have I guess might be.

901
00:59:33,471 --> 00:59:38,210
Scott: As a show, I think it may be the best one per episode divided by quality.

902
00:59:38,431 --> 00:59:47,790
Rym: It's just weird to me that I have such strong memories of liking Thundercats a lot Yet can remember almost nothing specific from Thundercats.

903
00:59:49,679 --> 00:59:53,168
Scott: hmm Yeah, also the music Thundercats are really good.

904
00:59:59,635 --> 01:00:01,229
Rym: All right, I think we killed enough time on this episode.

905
01:00:02,231 --> 01:00:06,169
Scott: Yeah, I kind of want to what I got to figure out where you can legally watch all of the tickets.

906
01:00:06,732 --> 01:00:07,676
Scott: Oh, well, you can legally.

907
01:00:07,837 --> 01:00:12,940
Rym: I'll send you a link to this clip or you can watch snarf beat the shit out of mumra Or I'll just go to yawn.

908
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:19,950
Rym: I don't know if I have time to watch all the Thundercats right now.

909
01:00:20,070 --> 01:00:21,115
Scott: I think I said I'll ski.

910
01:00:21,155 --> 01:00:23,103
Scott: I'm gonna skip the if I do watch it.

911
01:00:23,163 --> 01:00:24,650
Scott: I will skip the nothing episodes.

912
01:00:24,891 --> 01:00:26,703
Scott: I'll just watch the ones where stuff happens.

913
01:00:26,763 --> 01:00:38,360
Rym: It's you know good I'm at least I'm gonna go watch this doom gaze episode because I want to see what the deal is with the reference to Lovecraft Because that is something I definitely I was.

914
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:44,130
Rym: I knew Lovecraft and was into it by like middle school But by then I was not thinking about Thundercats anymore.

915
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:50,488
Rym: So whatever that episode happened, even if I saw it, there is no way I would have recognized what Cthulhu was though my parents might have.

916
01:00:56,275 --> 01:00:58,810
