00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,311
Rym: It's Wednesday, June 24th, 2020.

2
00:00:12,311 --> 00:00:12,793
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:15,239
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:15,259 --> 00:00:19,758
Rym: tonight We're talking about online anime conventions and why that's really hard to do.

5
00:00:21,501 --> 00:00:22,536
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:25,303 --> 00:00:27,160
Rym: Yeah, we're still stuck inside obviously.

7
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:28,345
Rym: So a lot of the things like.

8
00:00:28,365 --> 00:00:31,580
Rym: we can't just talk about how we're biking cuz we're not like biking to work every day.

9
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,125
Scott: I could talk about how I'm biking.

10
00:00:33,145 --> 00:00:36,374
Scott: I just not going anywhere in one place without moving.

11
00:00:37,317 --> 00:00:38,280
Rym: Oh, you gotta get a new trainer.

12
00:00:39,261 --> 00:00:41,512
Scott: No, there's one in the in the the guy.

13
00:00:41,532 --> 00:00:42,637
Scott: I'm in the building reopened.

14
00:00:43,019 --> 00:00:45,667
Rym: Oh I think we might have already talked about this.

15
00:00:46,148 --> 00:00:49,718
Scott: we did but something weird happened when I was biking without moving yesterday.

16
00:00:50,039 --> 00:01:00,493
Scott: Oh So, you know how sometimes right, you know, like the muscle in your leg will be like doink and it's like You know a cramp or a charlie horse or who the hell knows that's moving on.

17
00:01:00,734 --> 00:01:01,135
Scott: it hurts.

18
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:02,360
Scott: It starts moving on its own.

19
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:03,284
Rym: I know that feeling.

20
00:01:03,787 --> 00:01:06,540
Scott: you got to stretch it get it back into where it belongs, right?

21
00:01:06,844 --> 00:01:08,098
Scott: You know, who knows what the hell right?

22
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:15,310
Scott: You know, usually when that happens, it's like well, I got a. I got to wait a while Can't really do anything if it's a charlie horse.

23
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,919
Rym: I got sort of the specific technique to undo it.

24
00:01:18,683 --> 00:01:22,160
Scott: Sometimes you look and you can even see like your leg going like blah blah blah or something.

25
00:01:23,461 --> 00:01:26,800
Scott: Anyway, that hasn't happened in a long as time, but it happened yesterday.

26
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:30,851
Scott: I am biking in one place and suddenly my left calf goes like doink, right?

27
00:01:31,373 --> 00:01:32,937
Scott: So I stopped paddling.

28
00:01:33,398 --> 00:01:33,820
Rym: It's like you do.

29
00:01:35,164 --> 00:01:43,760
Scott: My leg is attached to the thing right with the shoes, so I don't want to or I mess it up and Then somehow I managed to undo it very quickly.

30
00:01:44,441 --> 00:01:46,047
Rym: No, maybe you've learned the technique.

31
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:47,231
Scott: I don't know it.

32
00:01:47,251 --> 00:01:48,597
Scott: just undid very quickly, right?

33
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,791
Scott: So I'm like hmm and a cautious sleeve pedal again, right?

34
00:01:54,092 --> 00:01:54,534
Scott: Like.

35
00:01:54,574 --> 00:01:55,075
Scott: is it gonna re?

36
00:01:55,276 --> 00:01:56,440
Scott: is it gonna re doink?

37
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,203
Scott: I don't know.

38
00:01:57,343 --> 00:01:58,670
Rym: I know the fear of the re doing.

39
00:01:59,153 --> 00:01:59,233
Scott: Yeah.

40
00:01:59,273 --> 00:02:00,540
Scott: I'm like, I don't you know.

41
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:04,783
Scott: And It did not re doink.

42
00:02:05,866 --> 00:02:08,935
Scott: and in fact, it felt like like the leg had leveled up.

43
00:02:09,014 --> 00:02:12,642
Scott: I was like what the fuck I was like Like.

44
00:02:12,702 --> 00:02:14,788
Scott: it felt better than pretty that it did pre doing.

45
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:19,200
Scott: so I'm like a very brief doink that went away.

46
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:23,230
Scott: So he's got more powerful now suddenly leveled up this leg.

47
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:23,972
Rym: It's like burning.

48
00:02:23,992 --> 00:02:27,040
Rym: will you fail it leg enough and your leg just gets stronger?

49
00:02:27,803 --> 00:02:28,024
Scott: I've got.

50
00:02:28,044 --> 00:02:33,246
Scott: I don't know what I think I just want to know what the medical explanation for that Cuz.

51
00:02:33,267 --> 00:02:34,158
Scott: that's really strange.

52
00:02:34,963 --> 00:02:39,286
Rym: Yep, so my only cuz I'm running a lot because of this Quarantine like.

53
00:02:39,306 --> 00:02:41,319
Rym: that's a really good just thing I can do outside.

54
00:02:42,085 --> 00:02:43,940
Rym: I can run where I don't really encounter people.

55
00:02:44,423 --> 00:02:53,643
Rym: But I've been trying to replace my running shoes every two or three hundred miles because that's what my doctor said to do to prevent problems because I'd had some problems because I run so Much and the doctor

56
00:02:53,683 --> 00:03:02,371
Scott: rather the Rym is found to do advanced technique rather than break his shit on purpose to excuse Consumerist material ways to buy new shit.

57
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:04,320
Scott: with his vest hordes of money.

58
00:03:04,721 --> 00:03:09,614
Scott: He has now found a doctor to prescribe him to purchase new.

59
00:03:09,734 --> 00:03:14,149
Rym: I went to a doctor new physical therapist a while ago Like you're ago two years ago at this point.

60
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:16,960
Rym: He's found a doctor who I got some.

61
00:03:17,945 --> 00:03:23,820
Scott: Give you permission to spend more money and indulge your consumerist materialist way.

62
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:26,447
Rym: the doctor was literally I Solve you of your guilt.

63
00:03:26,568 --> 00:03:27,331
Rym: how much do you run?

64
00:03:27,351 --> 00:03:31,779
Rym: and I was like eh and then they were like How long you've been running in the shoes you own right now?

65
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,185
Rym: How long have you owned them?

66
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:34,149
Rym: you even know.

67
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:38,647
Rym: and I was like, I don't know like three years and she was like I will bet you that is the problem.

68
00:03:38,687 --> 00:03:40,494
Rym: buy new shoes and I bet I'll never see you again.

69
00:03:40,514 --> 00:03:43,025
Rym: and the PT was like Yeah, buy new shoes.

70
00:03:43,065 --> 00:03:44,431
Rym: That is probably your problem.

71
00:03:44,531 --> 00:03:46,580
Scott: They're in there in the pocket of big shoes.

72
00:03:47,203 --> 00:03:50,820
Rym: So I did buy new shoes and it was like night and day and like I could even see my times.

73
00:03:50,961 --> 00:03:52,207
Rym: I see they have put you in the.

74
00:03:52,307 --> 00:03:54,700
Scott: I see they have taken you into their pocket of big shoe.

75
00:03:55,462 --> 00:03:58,109
Rym: It was more that for the longest time.

76
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:01,980
Rym: My goal was I will wear shoes until they literally fall apart.

77
00:04:02,521 --> 00:04:03,344
Scott: I have a shoe.

78
00:04:03,464 --> 00:04:08,800
Scott: I'll wear it until it is so dirty or broken in some way that it is not no longer wearable.

79
00:04:08,901 --> 00:04:10,895
Rym: So I plan to replace him like they said 200 miles.

80
00:04:11,641 --> 00:04:15,205
Rym: I was pushing it to like 300 400 like fine Whatever like.

81
00:04:15,868 --> 00:04:17,777
Rym: but I was only counting runs.

82
00:04:18,521 --> 00:04:27,500
Rym: I did with Strava and because I messed up my synchronization when I looked at the stats I wasn't counting like treadmill runs all the other stuff I do that I track else in other ways.

83
00:04:28,202 --> 00:04:31,413
Rym: So I thought I had some shoes that I'd run like 300 ish 400 ish miles in.

84
00:04:31,473 --> 00:04:36,912
Rym: no I'd run over 800 miles in those shoes.

85
00:04:37,554 --> 00:04:38,959
Scott: Well, did you get any problems?

86
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:46,940
Rym: Yep I was actually having some Sciatic problems on one side and also my feet were starting to give me some plantar fasciitis adjacent problems again.

87
00:04:47,383 --> 00:04:49,079
Rym: So I got new shoes did some runs.

88
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,793
Rym: My times were way better with the new shoes.

89
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,080
Rym: They feel completely different.

90
00:04:54,421 --> 00:04:59,584
Rym: I actually put him side by side and I tried to measure the inside the shoes I had been wearing.

91
00:04:59,905 --> 00:05:02,835
Rym: the padding inside was half a centimeter thinner.

92
00:05:02,955 --> 00:05:04,199
Rym: It had been compressed that much.

93
00:05:04,784 --> 00:05:06,139
Scott: Well, it's got to be the shoes.

94
00:05:06,802 --> 00:05:07,626
Rym: Well, we'll see.

95
00:05:07,847 --> 00:05:12,184
Rym: it seems like all my problems have gone away once again Not only about new shoes.

96
00:05:12,506 --> 00:05:15,597
Scott: all this means apparently you don't know the meaning of it's got to be the shoes.

97
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:22,740
Rym: Yeah In this case, it seems like it literally has to be the shoes but Google Google for it's got to be.

98
00:05:25,522 --> 00:05:31,187
Rym: So it is anime day and one thing we want to talk about really briefly because it Ends on the 30th.

99
00:05:31,288 --> 00:05:32,253
Rym: Today is the 24th.

100
00:05:32,294 --> 00:05:33,159
Rym: There's still time.

101
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:38,300
Rym: Annecy the the animation festival went online this year.

102
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,527
Rym: I think we talked to me mentioned this a few times right?

103
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:48,000
Scott: if you don't know Annecy is basically, you know film festival wise Right, you know we're talking like, you know con like film festival, right?

104
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:54,927
Scott: Yeah for animation is pretty much the world's number one animation Specific film festival, right?

105
00:05:54,947 --> 00:05:56,975
Scott: There are other ones for example in New York.

106
00:05:57,015 --> 00:06:00,607
Scott: We always go to the New York International children's film festival.

107
00:06:00,767 --> 00:06:03,095
Scott: that is a children's film festival.

108
00:06:03,135 --> 00:06:04,760
Scott: It's not an animation film festival.

109
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:09,238
Scott: It just happens to include cement a lot of animation because it's a children's film festival, right?

110
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:16,220
Scott: Annecy is basically the number one premier world Animation film festival, right?

111
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:20,756
Scott: So if you submit your animation there and get it in and win that's a big fucking deal you get.

112
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,750
Scott: so when you put out Your DVD you can put some little some little.

113
00:06:23,971 --> 00:06:25,015
Scott: uh, what are they called?

114
00:06:25,036 --> 00:06:25,879
Scott: You know?

115
00:06:26,981 --> 00:06:29,733
Scott: The little the the ferns with some words in between.

116
00:06:29,753 --> 00:06:31,320
Rym: oh just get an award.

117
00:06:32,121 --> 00:06:42,598
Scott: Yeah, you know, yeah, we buy a DVD and there's like all those little fern thingies Looks like the Caesars crown or whatever You know with some gold text in there that says winner Annecy 20, right?

118
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:51,920
Scott: So normally to go to Annecy which by the way is named after like most conventions in Europe like, you know Say Essen which takes place in Essen Annecy takes place in Annecy France.

119
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:56,760
Scott: So if you want to go to Annecy and see the animations in Annecy, you'd have to go to Annecy.

120
00:06:57,021 --> 00:07:00,580
Rym: Yep, I don't plan to go to the city of Otakon anytime in the near future?

121
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,432
Scott: Yeah, no, but I'm saying is Annecy is not.

122
00:07:03,472 --> 00:07:04,235
Scott: so, you know, it's like.

123
00:07:04,376 --> 00:07:07,931
Scott: I'd probably like to go there But I don't see that on my horizon, right?

124
00:07:08,474 --> 00:07:14,898
Scott: Well currently definitely not Yeah, so I didn't see it in my past either not even once that haven't been to France or Europe.

125
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:20,349
Scott: So Yeah So I've never been able to see the works of.

126
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:25,590
Scott: Anna said there were shown at Annecy with any amount of ease unless they Were shown somewhere else like you

127
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:33,320
Rym: get like a lot of times like goblin stuff Like you'll find YouTube channels where they post it like you could poke around but you definitely wouldn't get this full program by any stretch

128
00:07:33,642 --> 00:07:33,843
Scott: Right.

129
00:07:33,863 --> 00:07:44,788
Scott: So thanks to the physical Annecy being canceled they put it online and for 15 euro you can go to the Annecy online website and See all the films that would have.

130
00:07:44,828 --> 00:07:49,786
Scott: you would have been able to see if you went to Annecy only From your house, which is great.

131
00:07:49,846 --> 00:07:50,971
Rym: There's some good stuff in there.

132
00:07:51,192 --> 00:07:53,059
Scott: The website's a little bit mad, but it works.

133
00:07:53,341 --> 00:07:54,365
Scott: Yeah, they got subtitles.

134
00:07:54,425 --> 00:07:59,659
Rym: I think it was like a limited access Netflix that has a whole bunch of stuff You're not gonna be able to see anywhere else.

135
00:07:59,981 --> 00:08:15,138
Scott: The only problem is that there were some things that they were going to show at Annecy notably the Lupin the third CG movie that's coming and Because it's online they said well, you know, you're online the whole world can watch this 15 euro.

136
00:08:16,842 --> 00:08:18,570
Scott: We can't really put the whole movie right.

137
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:21,991
Scott: if it was at Annecy physically in a theater They would have shown the whole movie.

138
00:08:22,031 --> 00:08:27,197
Rym: but because it's online They're like, oh that is showing that the segment is often even at the physical film festivals.

139
00:08:27,217 --> 00:08:28,578
Rym: That's the thing That's it.

140
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,860
Scott: But in this case they did yeah, they were gonna show the whole thing.

141
00:08:32,307 --> 00:08:39,294
Scott: but instead Because it's online for only 15 euro Just showed some of the feature films most of the feature films.

142
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:42,407
Scott: they're not showing the whole movie They're only showing 15 minute.

143
00:08:42,587 --> 00:08:44,800
Scott: Like you're getting the intro part of the movie, right?

144
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:50,964
Rym: The thing I can say about that Lupin film though is that I can't review it as a Lupin movie because you have to see The whole thing to know.

145
00:08:50,984 --> 00:08:54,180
Rym: I've only seen the beginning but the animation looks a-plus like it looks great.

146
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,153
Scott: It looks like it looks like a Lupin movie.

147
00:08:56,173 --> 00:08:57,120
Scott: It's that's I want to watch it.

148
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:16,504
Rym: Yep, and I get the impression if I had to guess based on the little bit I've seen it is a like Completely generic Lupin Reminiscent of like the era of Lupin that Scott and I have talked about a lot like those movies that were okay Not great not terrible not the like later 2000s Lupin's.

149
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:20,777
Scott: it appears to be a well based on the 15-minute segment.

150
00:09:20,797 --> 00:09:28,940
Scott: We saw a extremely well-crafted But completely by the book Lupin movie, which is who doesn't want that?

151
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:35,422
Rym: Yeah, so maybe like around the level of a Fuma conspiracy in terms of like quality as a Lupin I don't know.

152
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:36,044
Scott: Fuma conspiracy.

153
00:09:36,084 --> 00:09:37,569
Scott: It's something special going on.

154
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:38,613
Rym: Fuma conspiracy had.

155
00:09:38,693 --> 00:09:44,480
Rym: there's there's generic Lupin There's generic Lupin with one twist and then there's bad Lupin.

156
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:50,271
Scott: Anyway, I've watched all of the official.

157
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:54,007
Scott: oh, there's also some work-in-progress Things.

158
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,980
Rym: oh my god, the wolf walkers one.

159
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:56,763
Rym: You can see.

160
00:09:56,783 --> 00:10:03,952
Scott: there's a long segment about wolf walkers and a long segment about Inoue Which is Yuasa's next movie coming next year.

161
00:10:03,972 --> 00:10:04,815
Rym: I didn't fit it watch the.

162
00:10:05,016 --> 00:10:06,060
Rym: you know, you know one.

163
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,727
Rym: Yeah, but I will say is the wolf walkers one.

164
00:10:07,827 --> 00:10:09,454
Rym: I was already at maximum.

165
00:10:09,494 --> 00:10:10,519
Rym: Hype for wolf walkers.

166
00:10:11,662 --> 00:10:22,100
Rym: But somehow after watching that especially when the animators talked about how they drew the town versus how they drew the forest I'm at a hundred and ten percent now, right?

167
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,251
Rym: I am more hyped for a movie that I'm already maximum hype for.

168
00:10:25,652 --> 00:10:26,294
Scott: they're showing you.

169
00:10:26,355 --> 00:10:27,860
Scott: It's basically those are works in progress.

170
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:34,359
Scott: They're basically somewhat sort of mini documentary behind-the-scenes interview things where they're showing you what they're working on and how they made it.

171
00:10:35,222 --> 00:10:41,947
Scott: And then there's all the different short animations that are in the competition And they're split into different segments.

172
00:10:42,007 --> 00:10:45,600
Scott: There's children's ones graduation ones, which I presume are student films.

173
00:10:46,102 --> 00:10:49,540
Scott: There are these perspectives ones which I don't know what the deal is with those.

174
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,550
Scott: Maybe they're ones that have like something to say and watch those.

175
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:55,560
Rym: what I'd recommend is don't try to unless you're like an animator.

176
00:10:55,881 --> 00:11:01,382
Rym: I wouldn't recommend going to the like buying this thing going in and just trying to watch literally everything in the order It's presented.

177
00:11:01,523 --> 00:11:02,005
Rym: There's a lot.

178
00:11:02,025 --> 00:11:02,828
Scott: I watched literally.

179
00:11:02,948 --> 00:11:04,414
Scott: I watched literally everything in the order.

180
00:11:04,474 --> 00:11:13,630
Scott: It's presented in the official Right, which is the like, you know the ones that are trying, you know I guess they're just shorts submitted for the official competition.

181
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:16,179
Scott: There are official selections of the whatever.

182
00:11:16,239 --> 00:11:19,440
Scott: I don't know I don't know what determines what goes into my category.

183
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:24,100
Scott: But that was the biggest category of short animated films and I watched every single one.

184
00:11:24,201 --> 00:11:26,500
Rym: But you've got until the 30th Tuesday next week.

185
00:11:26,621 --> 00:11:35,579
Rym: So even though this has been going on for a while already 15 euros for basically almost a week's worth of access to this thing if you buy it today still worth it.

186
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:41,960
Scott: Think of it like a temporary Netflix with special stuff in it that will go away on the 30th with like, you know, so it's like.

187
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:43,548
Scott: It's like.

188
00:11:43,588 --> 00:11:43,993
Scott: why not?

189
00:11:44,013 --> 00:11:47,093
Scott: Yeah So this stuff isn't available anywhere else.

190
00:11:47,615 --> 00:11:56,553
Rym: So in some other news This movie wasn't on a lot of people's radar for some reason, but it's just out on Netflix like as of last week I want to say June 18th.

191
00:11:56,614 --> 00:11:57,219
Rym: It was released.

192
00:11:58,661 --> 00:12:01,073
Rym: It's Junichi Sato's a whisker away.

193
00:12:01,535 --> 00:12:02,460
Rym: the trailer looks good.

194
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:12,601
Rym: It's basically about a girl who well vaguely It's a trailer and the movie obviously has a lot of allegory and metaphor a girl who likes a boy and turns into a cat To be with him.

195
00:12:14,704 --> 00:12:18,070
Scott: I think I heard that story, but I didn't hear the title or that it was a Netflix thing.

196
00:12:18,491 --> 00:12:21,721
Rym: Yeah, the literal translation of the title is something like wanting to cry.

197
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:25,839
Rym: I pretend to be a cat but okay What are we always saying when it comes to it?

198
00:12:25,859 --> 00:12:26,765
Scott: You want did you watch it?

199
00:12:26,906 --> 00:12:27,229
Rym: Not yet?

200
00:12:28,051 --> 00:12:39,150
Rym: Okay, but what I will say is that it's on Netflix like right now We always say if there's an anime movie that is not a sequel to an existing IP You should pretty much just watch it if you have access to it.

201
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,100
Rym: So I'm gonna say you should probably just watch this.

202
00:12:42,682 --> 00:12:45,370
Rym: We're going to watch it at some point soon and do a review on it I'm sure.

203
00:12:46,151 --> 00:12:49,185
Rym: But I didn't realize like I forgot Junichi Sato.

204
00:12:49,205 --> 00:12:59,000
Rym: Uh So none of you will care except like one of you maybe that I guess he directed slayers premium Which is the last of the slayers.

205
00:12:59,301 --> 00:13:07,839
Rym: like quote unquote movies Okay, but more importantly he's the mahout sky tie guy Okay, magic users Club.

206
00:13:08,261 --> 00:13:13,526
Rym: So based on the trailer I think this movie is gonna be pretty good and I've seen pretty good reviews of it already.

207
00:13:13,546 --> 00:13:15,644
Scott: Oh Sounds good.

208
00:13:15,785 --> 00:13:16,008
Rym: Yeah

209
00:13:17,072 --> 00:13:30,970
Scott: Alright, so since I've been trapped at home This giant wall of comics behind me right with most of which I've read in my life But some of which I have not had the time to read I've been able to get to spend time reading it because I'm not doing anything.

210
00:13:32,073 --> 00:13:40,925
Scott: So I read all Twelve well twelve omnibus volumes of lone wolf and cub.

211
00:13:41,026 --> 00:13:47,396
Scott: each one of those is like You know three to five Smaller volumes worth right?

212
00:13:47,777 --> 00:13:52,490
Scott: Who knows how many but basically I read all of lone wolf and cub from those dark horse editions.

213
00:13:52,972 --> 00:14:02,715
Scott: Oh, I have not read all of lone wolf and cub by even up right and seeing how that's rims probably unlikely to do So anytime in the near future Just getting geeked by it.

214
00:14:02,755 --> 00:14:04,341
Scott: I mean, obviously it's legendary.

215
00:14:04,381 --> 00:14:06,490
Scott: Do you really need someone to tell you that you should read it?

216
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,576
Scott: No, that's why I read it.

217
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,650
Rym: I guess I could bike over there with a backpack.

218
00:14:11,052 --> 00:14:11,596
Scott: Good luck.

219
00:14:11,657 --> 00:14:13,430
Scott: It'll take you a while this long.

220
00:14:15,471 --> 00:14:17,317
Scott: So, what's the deal with lone wolf and cub?

221
00:14:17,438 --> 00:14:20,127
Scott: obviously it's a samurai story, right?

222
00:14:21,932 --> 00:14:27,275
Scott: you know nerds have seen the Mandalorian and It's a lot better than that.

223
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:34,970
Scott: Yeah, but there's a samurai in themes And he is the shogun's executioner, right?

224
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:46,062
Scott: But then the basically another group right in the another clan Wants, you know someone from their clan to be in that position.

225
00:14:46,563 --> 00:14:48,470
Scott: So they do him dirty, right?

226
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:52,502
Scott: And he is a master of you know, the sword Lee arts.

227
00:14:52,743 --> 00:15:05,830
Scott: So no one can really mess with him and His wife dies and he just had this kid and he's you know, the kid basically is Not old enough to talk real, right?

228
00:15:06,831 --> 00:15:17,309
Scott: He's like, you know, basically zero but the kid decides to Go with the dead on their their journey through me fumado, which is the Buddhist hell.

229
00:15:18,196 --> 00:15:35,050
Scott: rather than Be killed by his father mercifully He takes the kid with him on the journey throughout Japan and basically most of the chapters are Episodic, you know situations they get caught in right on their journey around Japan.

230
00:15:36,652 --> 00:15:45,426
Scott: But all of these little you know episodes encountering different people and their troubles and whatnot Right are tied together by the larger plot of.

231
00:15:45,446 --> 00:15:52,430
Scott: you know Lone wolf in club versus right that clan that did them dirty at the beginning, right?

232
00:15:53,691 --> 00:15:59,850
Scott: And you know people who are who act in honorable samurai ways and those who don't right?

233
00:16:01,774 --> 00:16:02,521
Scott: and such and such.

234
00:16:02,581 --> 00:16:07,429
Scott: so it's Unlike other works of.

235
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:11,897
Scott: You know What's his name Oh Kazuo?

236
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:12,279
Scott: Okay.

237
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:13,542
Rym: I was about to say Kazuo.

238
00:16:13,603 --> 00:16:14,004
Rym: Okay.

239
00:16:14,024 --> 00:16:15,067
Rym: Is that what you're fumbling for?

240
00:16:15,368 --> 00:16:18,417
Scott: Yeah that guy unlike other Kazuko IK works.

241
00:16:18,939 --> 00:16:30,310
Scott: it does not get as crazy and The sex and violence like in a crying Freeman sort of way, but there's plenty of sex and there is no shortage.

242
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:34,856
Scott: It's just not as ridiculous At all times right?

243
00:16:34,917 --> 00:16:42,169
Scott: It is only ridiculous seemingly like when it's appropriate for it to be so When when it you know the situation demands, right?

244
00:16:44,292 --> 00:16:56,389
Scott: But yeah if you're wondering why you know all those other people Who are so inspired by lone wolf and cub right to to make samurai things and and?

245
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:59,757
Scott: Appropriative works in the West right.

246
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,906
Scott: you can find out pretty easily just by reading all of this.

247
00:17:03,046 --> 00:17:04,270
Scott: it is well worth your time.

248
00:17:04,631 --> 00:17:08,549
Rym: I was looking to see if we've ever actually reviewed it because I've read like the first volume.

249
00:17:09,413 --> 00:17:22,846
Scott: Beyond that you know it does come to an end although towards the end It sort of devolves a little bit and like for briefly for a few chapters It goes sort of like away from lone wolf and cub to like these other sort of like.

250
00:17:22,925 --> 00:17:34,166
Scott: it feels like time-killing Episodes showing you some other people mm-hmm, but then it actually comes together At the end and there's a big dramatic ending.

251
00:17:34,206 --> 00:17:38,570
Scott: it was well Timed and nope at no point does it feel like it's dragging on.

252
00:17:39,651 --> 00:17:40,474
Rym: That's a good sign.

253
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:47,865
Scott: You know towards the middle there is sort of like a dramatic confrontation And that dramatic confrontation does not finish things right.

254
00:17:47,905 --> 00:17:53,470
Scott: so then they have to sort of Do it go all through a whole nother rigamarole before you can get to the final battle.

255
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:56,102
Scott: So it's sort of like fists of the North Star does the same thing right?

256
00:17:56,122 --> 00:17:57,047
Scott: you see it a lot where it's like.

257
00:17:57,489 --> 00:18:03,430
Scott: you know It's like it fights row in fists of the North Star like somewhere towards the middle of the story.

258
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:14,927
Scott: Right and they fight a whole bunch But not enough to finish things right and then they have to continue later And then it goes through a whole nother series of stuff, and then the final battle right.

259
00:18:14,967 --> 00:18:15,949
Scott: so it's the same thing here.

260
00:18:16,492 --> 00:18:23,382
Scott: And lone wolf income right the these fight the end boss You got you can't finish things you come back and fight the end boss again.

261
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:28,260
Rym: Yep, so apparently in July of last year What we were talking about a star is on my.

262
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,448
Rym: but in the middle of that we apparently Mentioned lone wolf and cub and repeatedly told people they need to read it.

263
00:18:34,251 --> 00:18:39,026
Scott: Yeah, I mean if you it's like you know in terms of samurai stuff.

264
00:18:39,086 --> 00:18:42,145
Scott: It's pretty much like You know it.

265
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:45,699
Scott: this Right it's like the best samurai comic.

266
00:18:45,739 --> 00:18:48,570
Scott: There is you know if you like samurai movies?

267
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:06,750
Rym: but anyway things Of the day, so I don't know if any of you have ever heard of garum, but garum is our masala powder g-a-r-u-m.

268
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:15,681
Rym: it is a Basically a common table condiment from the era of ancient Rome like it was one of the most pot like it was the ketchup of Rome.

269
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:19,456
Scott: basically I guess yeah, I guess they didn't have Heinz 57 varieties in Rome.

270
00:19:19,877 --> 00:19:21,470
Rym: Yeah, well I mean think of this.

271
00:19:21,531 --> 00:19:22,319
Rym: did they have tomatoes?

272
00:19:23,183 --> 00:19:27,419
Rym: Some of you might be surprised by the answer if you didn't learn anything about history, but I digress.

273
00:19:28,366 --> 00:19:32,927
Rym: so garum is Not common anymore.

274
00:19:33,028 --> 00:19:35,759
Rym: those things that are very similar to it are common common.

275
00:19:36,421 --> 00:19:40,174
Rym: It's basically like a fish sauce like a fermented fish sauce.

276
00:19:40,194 --> 00:19:41,559
Rym: There's a lot of fermented sauce on it.

277
00:19:41,905 --> 00:19:47,394
Rym: Yeah But garum is a particular method of making fish sauce that was used in Rome.

278
00:19:47,915 --> 00:19:53,088
Rym: that makes a particularly salty watery form of this and You can buy.

279
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:57,880
Rym: there's a bunch of people who sell garum But supposedly it's not quite the same as what people would have eaten in Rome.

280
00:19:58,382 --> 00:20:01,920
Scott: So this is try cuz you don't want to eat something that's the same of what they eat in Rome.

281
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:06,960
Scott: Yeah, just what you just want the the good essence of it right what they probably had in Rome is probably like you.

282
00:20:07,722 --> 00:20:20,824
Rym: Yep, well, it's like old IPAs like yeah You can drink in an IPA beer that is authentic to what beer tasted like made in that way and transported in that way in That era would not recommend it Unless you're a historian.

283
00:20:21,285 --> 00:20:28,559
Rym: So in this case this dude who seems to know a lot about like food history And like his whole channel seems to be about this.

284
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,760
Rym: Basically, just like explains the whole deal with garum make some and then tries it.

285
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,752
Rym: He sips a little bit and tries to cook with it.

286
00:20:37,959 --> 00:20:40,810
Rym: Uh I don't know if I want to try garum per se.

287
00:20:41,813 --> 00:20:45,427
Rym: I get the impression that it tastes like Drinking like.

288
00:20:45,467 --> 00:20:48,581
Rym: it tastes like roe like just fish roe Any.

289
00:20:48,681 --> 00:21:00,920
Scott: I got the impression from the video that it's because I saw the video also that it tastes like fishy salt water like The way the ocean smells when you're driving your car to the beach and it's a really kind of low tide kind of stank.

290
00:21:01,081 --> 00:21:10,227
Scott: Yeah, right you get that strong Ocean smell that you get right not from like the beautiful oceans where it's clear water But from like, you know, the New Jersey Ocean, right?

291
00:21:10,428 --> 00:21:13,579
Scott: Yep, and I imagine it smells like drinking that like a face full of it.

292
00:21:14,261 --> 00:21:23,732
Rym: Yep, but if anything else this video is worth watching because you actually get a lot of history about like how Condiments were used in ancient Rome and it's actually pretty fascinating.

293
00:21:24,495 --> 00:21:25,700
Scott: I mean, it makes a lot of sense, right?

294
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,964
Scott: Salt makes things taste good.

295
00:21:27,064 --> 00:21:32,000
Scott: So I don't imagine they had like, you know, diamond crystal table salt in Rome, right?

296
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:36,220
Scott: So splashing some salty fishy water on your food probably made it taste really.

297
00:21:37,221 --> 00:21:40,912
Rym: Places that evolved that developed salt mining had salt a lot earlier.

298
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:54,676
Rym: other places like salt was still very common, but the salt mining or Salination old salt collection was I don't know Extremely labor-intensive and kind of just involved collecting seawater and letting it dry out.

299
00:21:55,298 --> 00:21:58,419
Rym: Yep So what do you got?

300
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,463
Scott: Oh Thing of the day.

301
00:21:59,483 --> 00:22:01,731
Scott: Yeah, so way back in the day.

302
00:22:01,771 --> 00:22:02,534
Scott: Let me click on this.

303
00:22:02,574 --> 00:22:07,701
Scott: I get the exact year here 1986 I think Right in 1986.

304
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:12,484
Scott: There was an article in New type magazine.

305
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:14,169
Rym: Oh your grand prophecy of anime.

306
00:22:14,169 --> 00:22:15,413
Rym: 86, right?

307
00:22:15,453 --> 00:22:17,540
Scott: Yes, and they asked a bunch of different.

308
00:22:19,302 --> 00:22:19,904
Scott: Consider it right.

309
00:22:20,185 --> 00:22:28,114
Scott: they asked 21 anime industry leaders including Miyazaki Isao Takahata Mamoru.

310
00:22:28,275 --> 00:22:36,760
Scott: Oh, she Right all these like big-time anime people right from the day and they asked him their feelings on.

311
00:22:37,343 --> 00:22:43,320
Scott: You know the anime industry like what was going on in 1986 and they published it in new type magazine.

312
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,894
Scott: They put the person's picture with a bunch of text next to it.

313
00:22:45,914 --> 00:22:48,860
Scott: Just you know, hey How do you feel about the anime industry these days?

314
00:22:49,160 --> 00:23:04,644
Scott: everyone was really honest and open and let loose their gripes or positive feelings and Seven years ago the old type new type person At least if this article was posted Recent when was?

315
00:23:04,664 --> 00:23:06,290
Scott: that was the date when they posted this?

316
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:08,197
Scott: regardless some years ago, right?

317
00:23:08,959 --> 00:23:10,227
Scott: Oh, yeah It's only posted a week ago.

318
00:23:10,851 --> 00:23:12,340
Rym: Well, some of these are pretty brutal.

319
00:23:13,003 --> 00:23:17,040
Scott: Oh, yeah, the person who runs if you don't know Takahata seems pissed in particular.

320
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:17,603
Scott: Yeah, there's an.

321
00:23:17,784 --> 00:23:24,780
Scott: there's a. there's a tumblr called old type new type where this person publishes a scans from old new type magazines.

322
00:23:25,221 --> 00:23:46,573
Scott: But they because this one is so interesting they paid someone to translate the whole article some years ago and the translation is here underneath the images of the article and you can see exactly how the top people in the anime industry felt about the anime industry in 86 and You can now apply your knowledge of things that have happened in the past 24 34 years 34 years.

323
00:23:51,943 --> 00:23:52,646
Rym: Just talk on.

324
00:23:52,846 --> 00:23:58,700
Rym: I think now it is the thing a lot of people working in anime forgotten is the excitement They felt watching adventure movies when they were kids.

325
00:24:00,401 --> 00:24:03,347
Rym: Mm-hmm He goes this I'm gonna read this whole thing.

326
00:24:03,388 --> 00:24:04,230
Rym: This is fascinating.

327
00:24:04,752 --> 00:24:06,639
Scott: Yeah, cuz I have the good things of the day.

328
00:24:07,222 --> 00:24:08,758
Scott: Yeah, look what mom ro she wrote.

329
00:24:10,822 --> 00:24:12,250
Rym: We'll see what mama ro she wrote.

330
00:24:12,874 --> 00:24:13,779
Rym: I'm gonna read all of these.

00:24:14,482 --> 00:24:19,659
Rym: Yeah, you should in the moment stuck at home working on gig night stuff.

Rym: Maybe we'll start live streaming the show again soon.

333
00:24:23,182 --> 00:24:26,780
Rym: Maybe the video that we're recording right now, but not live streaming will appear on YouTube.

334
00:24:27,242 --> 00:24:30,099
Rym: Only people on YouTube will know if we successfully do that.

338
00:24:44,881 --> 00:24:52,936

339
00:24:52,977 --> 00:24:57,395
Rym: If not multiple Mm-hmm, and I don't know what else we really want to cover in this.

344
00:25:10,254 --> 00:25:12,241
Rym: we're forgetting something That about it.

345
00:25:14,964 --> 00:25:15,846
Scott: There's not much going on.

346
00:25:16,126 --> 00:25:16,426
Scott: Yeah.

347
00:25:16,887 --> 00:25:19,290
Rym: So one thing that's particularly not going on.

348
00:25:19,512 --> 00:25:20,969
Rym: I don't know how long we'll actually talk about this.

349
00:25:21,993 --> 00:25:25,290
Rym: You know, we used to go to a lot of anime cons like we got no other topic.

350
00:25:25,371 --> 00:25:25,956
Scott: That's why we're doing.

351
00:25:25,997 --> 00:25:34,340
Rym: I was looking at old GeekNights Like there is an era where we would do like three Separate Wednesday shows over the course of three weeks.

352
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,905
Rym: because remember we used to go four nights a week.

353
00:25:36,346 --> 00:25:51,050
Rym: that were literally called Otakon preview part 1 Otakon preview part 2 Otakon preview part 3. then we go to Otakon and then we had Otakon the review and then we had Otakon the review part 2.

354
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,221
Scott: I'm pretty sure it wasn't three previews.

355
00:25:53,281 --> 00:25:54,970
Scott: I'm pretty sure it was like one preview.

356
00:25:55,352 --> 00:25:56,960
Rym: I'll find the exact one.

357
00:25:57,021 --> 00:25:57,523
Rym: I looked at.

358
00:25:57,684 --> 00:25:58,730
Scott: you're exaggerating a little bit.

359
00:25:58,850 --> 00:25:59,373
Scott: I think it's like.

360
00:25:59,393 --> 00:26:03,453
Scott: I think it's like Otakon preview and then like Otakon part 1 Otakon part 2.

361
00:26:03,453 --> 00:26:04,502
Rym: Let's see it will.

362
00:26:04,543 --> 00:26:05,249
Rym: so we did.

363
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:08,684
Rym: Otakon 2006 was the one we did the most.

364
00:26:08,785 --> 00:26:18,456
Rym: we did Otakon preview Otakon 2006 part 1 Otakon 2006 part 2 and live at Otakon 2006 where we recorded something.

365
00:26:18,757 --> 00:26:22,890
Scott: Yeah, so there weren't three previews that you just exaggerated right anyway.

366
00:26:23,412 --> 00:26:24,315
Scott: But yeah, we used to do.

367
00:26:24,355 --> 00:26:29,070
Scott: we used to break up, you know episodes on conventions and do a whole bunch of stuff, right?

368
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:33,249
Rym: We did two different previews for a PAX once but they were on two different things.

369
00:26:34,434 --> 00:26:47,870
Rym: That was back in 2009 I think anyway We used to go to a lot of anime cons and we kept going to anime cons until a while ago when anime Boston was Kind of the last one we did and then we dropped out of that for reasons We've talked about don't really go to a lot of anime cons anymore.

370
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:54,090
Rym: But anime cons were still trucking along like Otakon despite moving losing it make on stellar trucking along.

371
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:58,042
Rym: Yeah, like anime Boston despite all its problems is still one of the best run anime cons.

372
00:26:58,083 --> 00:26:59,969
Rym: It's huge anime NYC.

373
00:27:00,089 --> 00:27:02,981
Rym: every year We want to go but it usually overlaps with something else.

374
00:27:03,001 --> 00:27:06,117
Rym: We're already committed to and we just don't go This year.

375
00:27:06,137 --> 00:27:13,758
Rym: it won't happen, obviously but Basically yawning on Sleepy sleepy time sleepy, baby.

376
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,569
Scott: I guess I'd need a nap after this.

377
00:27:24,695 --> 00:27:30,369
Rym: Anyway, so Video game cons and generic cons like kinetic ons doing an online thing.

378
00:27:30,911 --> 00:27:36,670
Rym: Bunch of gaming cons to do an online things packs is doing an official like big-money packs online.

379
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:41,349
Rym: But you're not seeing as many Online anime cons.

380
00:27:42,214 --> 00:27:43,469
Scott: And why do that are happening?

381
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:49,310
Rym: Not that big and I'm not gonna name names in any of these cons, but a few that have happened have not gone.

382
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:50,535
Rym: Well, right.

383
00:27:50,575 --> 00:27:51,238
Scott: Well, here's the thing.

384
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:52,944
Scott: So what does an anime con have right?

385
00:27:52,984 --> 00:27:54,874
Scott: It has a a Dealers room.

386
00:27:55,095 --> 00:28:02,446
Scott: Yeah, so for a dealers room to go online All those stores you see at a dealers room are typically have online stores 24 365 days a year.

387
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:11,570
Rym: Anyway, yep, like going to an anime con is mostly for them to offload merch that isn't moving otherwise to an impulse buying audience.

388
00:28:12,212 --> 00:28:18,330
Scott: Alright, so it's like if you just want to shop for anime shit, you could do that online even pre pandemic, you know.

389
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:19,817
Scott: So there's.

390
00:28:19,858 --> 00:28:28,996
Scott: no you can't really replicate the dealers room online other than What make a web page that lists what who would have been the dealers and so you can click through and go to their stores In case you didn't know.

391
00:28:29,238 --> 00:28:31,109
Scott: it's like it's not something you buy a ticket for.

392
00:28:31,651 --> 00:28:35,822
Rym: But also a lot of the people are buying stuff at anime con dealers room.

393
00:28:35,862 --> 00:28:42,006
Rym: in particular they're they're buying swords, which Okay, I feel like I saw it online bro.

394
00:28:42,147 --> 00:28:55,790
Rym: Exactly I feel like that is a like the the epitome of an impulse buy and I feel like a lot of those Sword purchases happen because the parents is not there at that exact moment, but the kid was given money to buy shit at the con.

395
00:28:57,293 --> 00:29:02,650
Rym: But anyway, everything else at the dealers room Usually you can buy online cheaper anyway.

396
00:29:04,052 --> 00:29:11,450
Rym: like sometimes usually It's very rare that there are exclusive things that an anime con dealers room that you could not have purchased online.

397
00:29:11,811 --> 00:29:17,570
Rym: You might just not have thought to purchase it online unless you were in the context of an anime con walk by a booth.

398
00:29:17,871 --> 00:29:18,254
Rym: It's awesome.

399
00:29:18,334 --> 00:29:22,985
Scott: It fits to the North Star book and I wouldn't think to buy a sword But suddenly there's a sword store in front of me.

400
00:29:23,005 --> 00:29:29,572
Rym: Yep I mean it takes me effort even in it when I would go to anime cons to not buy things that I see That.

401
00:29:29,613 --> 00:29:33,125
Scott: so the biggest room at the anime con can't really isn't really point.

402
00:29:33,145 --> 00:29:34,690
Scott: There's no point in having it online, right?

403
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:36,417
Scott: Okay, so the second biggest room is the artist alley.

404
00:29:36,437 --> 00:29:39,650
Scott: So the artist alley you also can buy all that stuff online.

405
00:29:39,751 --> 00:29:41,450
Scott: Well, all those artists have web pages.

406
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:42,575
Rym: This is where it gets tricky.

407
00:29:42,996 --> 00:29:44,603
Rym: artist bodies drive moves to.

408
00:29:44,643 --> 00:29:51,930
Rym: their sales are impulse buys Especially of things that are not available online often because of copyright issues, right?

409
00:29:52,031 --> 00:29:52,876
Scott: So you're you're.

410
00:29:53,299 --> 00:29:55,050
Scott: you could go to any of those people in artist alley.

411
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:57,210
Scott: They all have their own website so they sell stuff, right?

412
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:59,478
Scott: You can buy their merch whenever you want.

413
00:29:59,498 --> 00:30:00,541
Scott: They're happy to sell it to you.

414
00:30:00,601 --> 00:30:03,210
Scott: In fact, you know, they all have online shops, right?

415
00:30:05,131 --> 00:30:06,397
Scott: So what do you go artist alley for?

416
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:09,169
Scott: like Rym said all their fan arts and things.

417
00:30:09,531 --> 00:30:16,883
Scott: They're probably not selling them online because they can't because the online store will say hey You can't sell your drawing of Mickey Mouse.

418
00:30:16,943 --> 00:30:18,572
Scott: That's Disney.

419
00:30:18,632 --> 00:30:29,047
Rym: a lot of fan art and an artist alleys just gets under the line just because no one cares enough to go deal with In person at the event and even in the event that happens sometimes online.

420
00:30:29,067 --> 00:30:29,790
Rym: you're just screwed.

421
00:30:30,512 --> 00:30:38,747
Scott: so the the advantage of the artist alley is there are things for sale there that you can't buy online and Putting your anime con online doesn't fix that.

422
00:30:38,948 --> 00:30:48,669
Rym: Yep And I think the other advantage is literally just the impulse buys again Which if there's if something is just available as a store online You're not gonna get nearly as much of that.

423
00:30:49,065 --> 00:30:50,073
Rym: Oh That's a cool thing.

424
00:30:50,174 --> 00:30:56,928
Rym: immediately purchase it when I saw it because if you didn't go seek it out and find it online Previously you're not gonna suddenly do it now.

425
00:30:57,813 --> 00:31:16,941
Rym: I saw a lot of cons tried to do a thing where they did like a limited time virtual artist alley online where like Artists put up all their stuff and they all agree that it'll be exclusive to this online event Like this stuff lonely bees for sale for this time to try to get a lot of eyes on them all at the same time To drive that impulse by.

426
00:31:16,961 --> 00:31:27,288
Rym: I don't have any data But I don't think a huge amount of sales happen because of that except for the very first Handful of anime cons that did something like that.

427
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:30,420
Scott: I don't think that sustains right because without the physicals.

428
00:31:30,701 --> 00:31:37,404
Scott: because what a convention does to make money right or to make at least customers if it's not a for-profit convention right is?

429
00:31:37,806 --> 00:31:42,870
Scott: it handles the Logistics of the the space the time.

430
00:31:43,532 --> 00:31:44,295
Scott: You know the.

431
00:31:44,315 --> 00:31:48,850
Scott: you know the the water and the panel rooms the technology right the facilities.

432
00:31:49,311 --> 00:31:51,237
Scott: That is the work that a convention does.

433
00:31:51,357 --> 00:31:53,243
Scott: all the content at the convention is just.

434
00:31:53,824 --> 00:31:56,859
Scott: you know content at the convention that they've brought Together right.

435
00:31:57,121 --> 00:32:01,559
Scott: so when you're online You're not doing any of this facilities work right.

436
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:03,263
Scott: that work is no longer necessary.

437
00:32:03,303 --> 00:32:04,286
Scott: There's just internet work.

438
00:32:04,707 --> 00:32:05,609
Scott: Which is a lot less work.

439
00:32:06,733 --> 00:32:11,350
Scott: So all the convention has to offer is its brand and marketing power.

440
00:32:11,771 --> 00:32:22,814
Scott: But the thing is conventions don't have internet brand and marketing power especially not anime ones because like you know They're the online followings of conventions are like Super small.

441
00:32:22,834 --> 00:32:29,375
Scott: you show up at a convention and these most of the people there never went to the conventions website You know didn't even know.

442
00:32:29,415 --> 00:32:34,370
Scott: they like they do follow the convention on Twitter deck like more than a decade of experience.

443
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:37,120
Scott: They're not in the conventions forum right there nothing.

444
00:32:37,201 --> 00:32:44,067
Scott: all they did is figure out okay the conventions happening They bought a ticket, and they never interact with the convention in any way whatsoever online at all.

445
00:32:44,569 --> 00:32:53,190
Scott: right They just buy a ticket and show up, and that's all the old the extent of the interaction They have with the convention as an organization.

446
00:32:53,212 --> 00:32:56,459
Rym: Yeah But the showing up is the part that they're paying for.

447
00:32:56,539 --> 00:33:11,650
Rym: because what an anime counter really does at least in America Like its primary purpose is all these people are into anime and interact with each other online Want to for a weekend be unsupervised and physically in the same place to get up to shenanigans.

448
00:33:11,911 --> 00:33:15,542
Rym: That is the primary draw of anime cons and has been the next big.

449
00:33:15,562 --> 00:33:25,770
Scott: the next biggest thing the anime cons have are like main events which are like cosplay contests yeah, or You know anime chess kind of thing.

450
00:33:26,933 --> 00:33:28,420
Scott: All that's main event stuff.

451
00:33:28,581 --> 00:33:34,221
Rym: right those things like one Those are already streamed online and almost no one watches them.

452
00:33:34,421 --> 00:33:42,313
Rym: the audience at the con is almost always bigger than the streaming audience Because those events are not usually Good enough.

453
00:33:42,533 --> 00:33:49,870
Rym: or even if the content is good enough the quality of the filming and production values is not good enough to convey that Feeling to the people who are watching online.

454
00:33:50,211 --> 00:33:55,350
Rym: So it's an inferior experience to the point that people don't bother and people want to participate in it.

455
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:57,487
Rym: They want to yell and scream they want to get called up.

456
00:33:57,587 --> 00:34:01,849
Scott: also You can't participate in it in your if you're cosplaying at your house.

457
00:34:02,071 --> 00:34:05,750
Scott: Yep, you need it's cosplay as people coming together for those things, right?

458
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:09,985
Scott: It's like if people can cosplay at their house alone, but they could do that.

459
00:34:10,146 --> 00:34:10,628
Scott: Anyway.

460
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:12,704
Rym: Yep I've seen cons tried to do the same thing.

461
00:34:12,745 --> 00:34:16,184
Rym: like they're Sally They try to put together like a hashtag or a costume contest.

462
00:34:16,204 --> 00:34:21,565
Scott: like everyone submit a video everyone's like sir doesn't work because what the cosplay thing conventions is.

463
00:34:21,606 --> 00:34:29,469
Scott: the Cosplayers get lots of attention from people that they can see and you're not just standing there in front of a camera They do it that on twitch every day.

464
00:34:29,512 --> 00:34:34,364
Rym: Yeah most cosplayers or pros don't actually like they're not really there to be in the contest.

465
00:34:34,385 --> 00:34:36,536
Rym: so much as they're there to show off their Cut their costume.

466
00:34:36,556 --> 00:34:38,150
Rym: you're getting out with people in there.

467
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:44,469
Scott: Can you're getting several photographers who are showing up with their own volition to come around and photograph several cosplay people?

468
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:48,690
Scott: It's like well if you're a photographer, it's like well the photography has already been done.

469
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:52,527
Scott: You're already looking what a camera sees right because it's online.

470
00:34:52,649 --> 00:34:55,824
Scott: Yep You're looking at the camera of that the web the cosplayer has.

471
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:56,186
Scott: right.

472
00:34:56,206 --> 00:35:09,930
Rym: you're not going to the house yeah, so the whole photography aspect is just completely out and I feel like the cosplay community seems to be doing online costume contests kind Of on its own now without necessarily needing to be tied to any particular convention.

473
00:35:10,812 --> 00:35:15,324
Scott: Right the convention only provides facilities right if there's no facilities involved.

474
00:35:15,344 --> 00:35:18,032
Scott: They don't need anime Boston or Otakon All right.

475
00:35:18,172 --> 00:35:21,042
Rym: What about the panels like the gaming cons the generic cons?

476
00:35:21,323 --> 00:35:23,170
Rym: That's the thing these cons are doing online.

477
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,615
Rym: They live stream their panels.

478
00:35:24,957 --> 00:35:26,763
Rym: people can watch them online ask questions.

479
00:35:27,346 --> 00:35:28,490
Rym: I'm gonna be real with you.

480
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:29,275
Rym: This is like.

481
00:35:29,315 --> 00:35:30,321
Rym: this is a problem.

482
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:31,750
Rym: That is specific to anime cons.

483
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:36,652
Rym: 90% of anime con panels could never be put online Right.

484
00:35:36,733 --> 00:35:54,278
Scott: most anime con panels right at least the ones that people actually like going to and are well attended Right are usually involved showing clips from anime and talking interchangeably right and Displaying copyrighted materials on screen.

485
00:35:54,358 --> 00:35:58,956
Rym: my most popular panel at anime cons ever anime openers around the world It's I talk for two minutes.

486
00:35:59,197 --> 00:36:01,226
Rym: I show a clip that's gonna get a copyright strike.

487
00:36:01,286 --> 00:36:02,110
Rym: I talk for two minutes.

488
00:36:02,331 --> 00:36:04,764
Rym: I show a clip that's gonna get a copyright strike right.

489
00:36:04,885 --> 00:36:09,398
Scott: so you could Stream such a panel and get away with it right.

490
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:10,743
Scott: so for example.

491
00:36:10,863 --> 00:36:17,070
Scott: I see a lot of DJs on Twitch are Streaming DJ sets, and then they don't put they make sure there's no VOD.

492
00:36:17,391 --> 00:36:28,606
Scott: Yep, is it's gonna get taken down anyway, so you could put up a panel live stream it With all sorts of copyrighted shit get away with it and be kind of fine But it's still not the best.

493
00:36:28,909 --> 00:36:42,549
Rym: well There's a bunch of problems there when you lose that archive to a lot of panels that are not subject to copyright and don't have these problems from cons are already streamed and again Not a huge audience for that usually because of low production values.

494
00:36:43,585 --> 00:36:45,274
Rym: A Bigger problem.

495
00:36:45,314 --> 00:36:54,830
Rym: I think is that almost all anime panels that are not clip shows Go to questions from the audience right away And I have never seen a low-budget convention pull that off.

496
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:55,975
Rym: You don't want to take questions.

497
00:36:56,176 --> 00:36:59,250
Scott: questions from the audience are bad enough questions from the internet audience.

498
00:37:00,272 --> 00:37:02,806
Scott: You need some sort of thing there right?

499
00:37:03,289 --> 00:37:06,870
Scott: either You're not gonna get any questions, or you're gonna get too many bad questions.

500
00:37:07,171 --> 00:37:08,455
Scott: It's not easy to do yep.

501
00:37:08,556 --> 00:37:12,630
Rym: even worse most of those panels are a bunch of panelists who don't even know each other that way.

502
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:20,609
Rym: Well, so if you want to put that panel online You've got four people living in four different states having to stream themselves simultaneously somewhere.

503
00:37:21,432 --> 00:37:23,197
Scott: Put together four voice actors.

504
00:37:23,237 --> 00:37:33,729
Scott: you somehow got them all to stream together to it in like a. you know a zoom Right you got you know five voice actors in a zoom, and then you want to take questions from the audience like man.

505
00:37:34,574 --> 00:37:42,530
Scott: Yeah, it's gonna be not the greatest straight But here's the really real someone gonna pay money for that like if a pack enough that you can pay the voice actors.

506
00:37:42,873 --> 00:37:56,130
Rym: if a pax has a Panel online let's say the people who tend to present at those kinds of conventions Have the technology or the professional resources to do it in a professional way.

507
00:37:57,014 --> 00:37:58,823
Rym: I don't think the vast majority.

508
00:37:58,863 --> 00:37:59,446
Scott: sometimes.

509
00:37:59,807 --> 00:38:03,370
Rym: sometimes I've got some anecdotes that I cannot share in public.

510
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:09,590
Rym: But let's just say an extremely large multinational company was incapable of streaming to YouTube.

511
00:38:10,352 --> 00:38:16,389
Rym: Like could not do it despite having the hardware the software and having hired people to do it for them.

512
00:38:19,451 --> 00:38:32,550
Rym: Anyway, but ah when I go to anime cons The panelists tend to struggle with things like making their laptop display their slides In a way that does not happen nearly as often at most other cons.

513
00:38:33,232 --> 00:38:41,959
Rym: Mm-hmm I am not confident those people could stream their panel to an RTMP destination To then be put in an anime convention circuit.

514
00:38:42,501 --> 00:38:45,630
Scott: They could record their panel and the convention could then stream it.

515
00:38:46,752 --> 00:38:47,313
Rym: They could.

516
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:49,922
Scott: then then you're losing your question-answer aspect.

517
00:38:50,123 --> 00:38:52,050
Scott: It means the panel is going to be very short.

518
00:38:52,503 --> 00:38:53,533
Rym: Yep Cuz that's the problem.

519
00:38:53,614 --> 00:38:57,770
Rym: anime cons in particular the audience interaction is such a big part of those panels.

520
00:38:58,051 --> 00:39:04,616
Scott: Very few of the panels at an anime convention will fill up the entire time slot with Presentation.

521
00:39:04,998 --> 00:39:14,730
Rym: very few even good ones won't fill it up yep and the good ones that will are the ones that'll get hit by copyright strikes and Have problems and be very difficult to move into an online format.

522
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:30,730
Rym: And also there's this problem of even those panels when they're shown in the limited audience inside of a convention center where there's no like real cameras around a Lot of things they might say or copyright issues get glossed over because it wasn't broadcast anywhere.

523
00:39:32,112 --> 00:39:46,747
Rym: It's one thing if some DJ is like doing a stream and then deletes the VOD But if a convention brand officially streams someone's panel that has a bunch of copyright problems, even if the VOD disappears That could still open them up to some liability that I don't think they're ready for.

524
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:53,630
Rym: They also know they also often there's an ASCAP license that applies to in venue entertainment.

525
00:39:53,972 --> 00:39:57,130
Rym: That does not apply to streaming that shit online.

526
00:39:59,948 --> 00:40:01,495
Rym: Oh You yawned it again.

527
00:40:01,535 --> 00:40:02,437
Rym: We lost Scott to us.

528
00:40:02,498 --> 00:40:03,621
Scott: Yeah, I was sneezing that time.

529
00:40:03,742 --> 00:40:04,383
Scott: Oh, it was a sneeze.

530
00:40:04,544 --> 00:40:06,410
Scott: Ooh, I know right.

531
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:11,885
Scott: So yeah, another thing you go to anime con for right is is gaming there.

532
00:40:11,965 --> 00:40:13,129
Scott: There's always like a little gaming room.

533
00:40:13,309 --> 00:40:14,994
Scott: Yeah That it's like.

534
00:40:15,295 --> 00:40:16,598
Scott: it's like okay, whatever.

535
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:24,770
Rym: gaming cons are like desperately trying to figure out how to make Social gaming happen and gaming cons are uniquely equipped to do that.

536
00:40:25,292 --> 00:40:38,569
Rym: I don't think you can get a critical mass appeal like who would want to Go to the online anime con to play board games with the ten other people who are usually in that room playing board games When they could just play a board game online without the convention.

537
00:40:39,811 --> 00:40:43,224
Scott: Now maybe maybe an anime con, you know, they have concerts a make-ons.

538
00:40:43,244 --> 00:40:44,870
Scott: Yeah, they'll put their concert online, right?

539
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:45,734
Scott: But it's like wait a minute.

540
00:40:46,256 --> 00:40:50,878
Scott: So your anime con would have paid for This musician to come.

541
00:40:50,898 --> 00:40:52,786
Scott: and again, you're providing facilities, right?

542
00:40:52,806 --> 00:40:53,650
Scott: You set up a stage.

543
00:40:53,931 --> 00:40:59,192
Scott: Yeah, it's lights and all the instruments you pay for audio Singing and sure.

544
00:40:59,312 --> 00:40:59,432
Rym: in.

545
00:40:59,472 --> 00:41:02,557
Scott: so now audience this musician that you're hiring.

546
00:41:02,577 --> 00:41:04,119
Scott: They just say a band.

547
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:07,388
Scott: they're at home There's no stage.

548
00:41:08,431 --> 00:41:09,856
Scott: Okay, you got no facilities.

549
00:41:10,237 --> 00:41:11,060
Scott: So what are they gonna do?

550
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:11,401
Scott: They're gonna.

551
00:41:11,421 --> 00:41:17,502
Scott: they're gonna just play in there in their living room And stream it and someone's gonna pay money for that.

552
00:41:17,643 --> 00:41:23,707
Scott: when you could go on YouTube and See, they're just concert videos on YouTube that are legal.

553
00:41:23,828 --> 00:41:25,293
Scott: actually Yeah, they're gonna be.

554
00:41:25,373 --> 00:41:31,450
Scott: probably you could just watch like, you know, Regan, you know perfume live at Tokyo Dome.

555
00:41:31,632 --> 00:41:33,450
Scott: So why would I watch if I'm a weave?

556
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:34,392
Scott: Why would I watch?

557
00:41:34,613 --> 00:41:39,970
Rym: and even whatever the enemy God especially anime cons if it's Japanese acts that are performing?

558
00:41:40,412 --> 00:41:45,450
Rym: You know how most anime cons when it's that kind of act they have very strict no camera policies.

559
00:41:46,011 --> 00:41:47,014
Rym: There's a reason for that.

560
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:48,679
Rym: There is no way in hell.

561
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:51,790
Rym: Most of those bands would let the convention stream that concert.

562
00:41:53,232 --> 00:41:54,417
Scott: No, especially not Japanese one.

563
00:41:54,518 --> 00:41:54,598
Scott: Yeah.

564
00:41:54,618 --> 00:41:55,543
Scott: All right.

565
00:41:55,563 --> 00:41:59,461
Scott: So the final thing you do at a con All right is you hang out in the hallway with other people, right?

566
00:41:59,561 --> 00:42:01,469
Scott: Okay, so the so the con makes a chat room.

567
00:42:02,731 --> 00:42:11,650
Scott: Right, and here's the problem with the chat room and I think this is illustrate, you know Just the problem of real life versus, you know internet group socialization with strangers, right?

568
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:14,200
Scott: Is you know, let's say me and Ray Moran and anime con.

569
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:16,190
Scott: we're standing in the hallway chatting and we meet up.

570
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:17,033
Scott: We meet a listener.

571
00:42:17,073 --> 00:42:21,370
Scott: We're chatting with the listener and all the wildest people around us also chatting, right?

572
00:42:21,851 --> 00:42:27,167
Scott: But our human brains don't necessarily hear what the other people are saying right because they're around us.

573
00:42:27,288 --> 00:42:27,669
Rym: Yeah, right.

574
00:42:28,372 --> 00:42:30,325
Scott: And let's say banana maraca comes down the hallway.

575
00:42:30,406 --> 00:42:36,079
Rym: my boy I saw Right before this whole COVID thing.

576
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:36,882
Rym: He was last time.

577
00:42:36,922 --> 00:42:39,390
Scott: I saw him at was it paxies a couple years ago?

578
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:42,185
Rym: He comes by and says hi every year cuz I'm always working the front of maine theater.

579
00:42:43,009 --> 00:42:43,130
Scott: Okay?

580
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:44,657
Scott: I didn't see him at paxies this year.

581
00:42:44,677 --> 00:42:45,240
Rym: Oh, he was there.

582
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:46,025
Rym: He was there.

583
00:42:46,045 --> 00:42:46,970
Scott: Okay, I'm sure he was.

584
00:42:47,853 --> 00:42:49,230
Scott: See what banana comes down the hallway.

585
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:59,990
Scott: so now I'm in this unique anime con experience of chatting with Rym and the listener in a little conversation and Banana maraca is adding to the atmosphere of this conversation.

586
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:09,144
Rym: Yeah You know creating a great nerd moment there or they and then like a second later Some cosplayer who is now naked and about to be kicked out is running down the hall screaming.

587
00:43:09,485 --> 00:43:10,970
Rym: that also adds to the ambiance.

588
00:43:11,612 --> 00:43:12,275
Scott: Sure, it does.

589
00:43:12,696 --> 00:43:16,410
Scott: But now let's take that same scenario and let's put it into it to a text chat room.

590
00:43:16,891 --> 00:43:18,816
Scott: Right in this text chat room.

591
00:43:19,177 --> 00:43:21,041
Scott: I'm trying to talk to Rym and the listener.

592
00:43:21,422 --> 00:43:25,693
Scott: But meanwhile, there's this maraca sound that just won't go away Alright.

593
00:43:25,975 --> 00:43:37,100
Scott: and in the in the text chat these big banana emojis keep popping up and I'm trying to have to keep scrolling up to read what the listener just said because it's getting pushed up The screen by all these bananas and maracas.

594
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,370
Rym: think about any twitch stream that's even remotely popular.

595
00:43:39,591 --> 00:43:42,340
Rym: You can't read anything anyone has typed at any points.

596
00:43:43,143 --> 00:43:49,409
Scott: Yeah, so it's like that same behavior Right, that is like an antisocial behavior in real life.

597
00:43:50,072 --> 00:43:53,630
Scott: Right could actually be acceptable under the right circumstances, right?

598
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:58,330
Scott: You know banana maraca guy he doesn't like get in your face with the maracas, right?

599
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:03,050
Scott: He doesn't like, you know, I've never seen him like, you know, you know hit anyone with a maraca.

600
00:44:03,311 --> 00:44:09,110
Scott: He's always a chill dude and all these guys never seen him like amplify the volume of his maracas ears, right?

601
00:44:09,370 --> 00:44:11,730
Scott: He just walks down the hallway shaking his maraca.

602
00:44:13,351 --> 00:44:17,910
Scott: Right, you know but in a chat room shaking a maraca is the equivalent.

603
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:21,103
Scott: It is like there's no way to not be in someone's face.

604
00:44:21,143 --> 00:44:22,268
Scott: You either shake it or you don't.

605
00:44:22,629 --> 00:44:22,790
Scott: right?

606
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:32,712
Scott: it's you either post text and move the screen upwards or you don't or Everyone like no way to have like a little maraca on the side of the screen going like shaky shaky shake or what might end Up happening.

607
00:44:32,732 --> 00:44:33,917
Rym: You have a big social space.

608
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:38,115
Rym: That's too big, but people they've either break it down You shard it off into like.

609
00:44:38,437 --> 00:44:39,240
Rym: here's the area.

610
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,650
Rym: if you want to talk about this aspect of anime.

611
00:44:41,791 --> 00:44:49,602
Rym: That's like you make like 20 channels to try to spread the load out to reduce that Volume and to get people at least vaguely talking about the same thing.

612
00:44:50,264 --> 00:44:59,112
Rym: the more you shard it off the more you lose The whole point of people at anime cons of interacting with a variety of people and maybe having their conversation altered by that Context.

613
00:44:59,514 --> 00:45:04,150
Rym: and if you get too specific, how is that different from all the discords that are already out there today?

614
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:13,170
Rym: Like how is it different the anime Boston discord versus the anime discord if there's no actual physical anime Boston to react to?

615
00:45:13,833 --> 00:45:15,629
Scott: So too long didn't listen, right?

616
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:21,350
Scott: All the things that convention provides are literally just physical presence.

617
00:45:21,812 --> 00:45:31,695
Scott: so trying to take a convention online is basically like okay, so Nothing, well Everything you provide.

618
00:45:31,715 --> 00:45:32,397
Rym: I put it this way.

619
00:45:32,417 --> 00:45:36,187
Rym: There is a struggle for all cons to do something online.

620
00:45:36,208 --> 00:45:37,010
Rym: That is meaningful.

621
00:45:37,352 --> 00:45:47,550
Rym: however, anime cons have Far fewer options that are feasible compared to other kinds of cons though other kinds of cons do have a lot of problems like packs.

622
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:53,652
Rym: Online is gonna be really hard to pull off But it is a thousand times easier to pull off than an anime online Right.

623
00:45:53,733 --> 00:46:03,366
Scott: All you can really do I think as a convention online is a. if your brand is strong enough You can provide marketing push for people with weaker brands because that's one thing a convention does.

624
00:46:03,447 --> 00:46:14,500
Scott: they say it's like, you know packs you go to packs and when you're at packs you see something that is not that you didn't know about right because they're They're paying to be at packs and ride on the bigger brand.

625
00:46:14,861 --> 00:46:15,122
Scott: right.

626
00:46:15,242 --> 00:46:21,910
Scott: you're getting promoted by something big just like if you know an Actual popular podcast that people listen to mentioned GeekNights, right?

627
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:26,390
Scott: It would be the same kind of big brand says something about little brand, right?

628
00:46:27,091 --> 00:46:32,149
Scott: So if your convention actually has a brand you could you sell your marketing power to others, right?

629
00:46:33,773 --> 00:46:38,430
Scott: But other than that, it's like alright, you know You don't have a community.

630
00:46:40,275 --> 00:46:40,698
Scott: What do you?

631
00:46:40,799 --> 00:46:41,524
Scott: what do you sell it?

632
00:46:41,806 --> 00:46:44,770
Rym: Yep, and Also some of these other cons.

633
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:47,580
Rym: they have a lot of avenues that don't apply to anime cons.

634
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,948
Rym: like an anime con is not gonna be successful.

635
00:46:50,008 --> 00:47:00,260
Rym: trying to run a Big like video game tournament as part of the anime con online because all the anime all the gaming cons They're literally like running video game tournaments online.

636
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:03,570
Scott: Like that's the main also the video game people just play in the same tournaments.

637
00:47:03,691 --> 00:47:04,695
Scott: They always did right.

638
00:47:04,755 --> 00:47:05,016
Scott: It's like.

639
00:47:05,378 --> 00:47:06,684
Scott: it's like those people who are.

640
00:47:06,704 --> 00:47:11,285
Scott: it's like, okay you go to An account a con that has a Street Fighter tournament, right?

641
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:17,270
Scott: All right It's like well the people were in that tournament or a Street Fighter people who happen to live nearby and they went for a tournament.

642
00:47:17,733 --> 00:47:20,832
Scott: But those people were playing Street Fighter tournaments all the time Everywhere.

643
00:47:21,434 --> 00:47:29,722
Scott: So if your con isn't providing that physical meetup space for them to have a physical Street Fighter tournament Then that day that you're that weekend that your convention would have been.

644
00:47:30,023 --> 00:47:33,918
Scott: they're just gonna play in whatever Street Fighter They would have played on any other weekend.

645
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:34,401
Rym: Yep.

646
00:47:34,983 --> 00:47:37,748
Rym: The other thing that's happening This is sort of a meta to end it.

647
00:47:38,352 --> 00:47:43,217
Rym: Most of the online cons that are big and backed by real money and are pretty serious They're.

648
00:47:43,419 --> 00:47:58,206
Rym: they're gonna be free like there's no badge to buy because the goal is to keep the brand of the convention alive and to sort of like Keep everyone together until the convention can start up again, but anime cons in particular are mostly nonprofits.

649
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:05,950
Rym: I Don't think they can afford to pay for the things necessary to run an online con without charging money.

650
00:48:06,431 --> 00:48:16,650
Rym: But I don't think there are many people on earth willing to pay for an online Convention of any kind unless they're very narrowly target experiences like NSE.

651
00:48:17,631 --> 00:48:22,950
Scott: Yeah to pay that's basically all you can do is you can get exclusive content from somewhere, right?

652
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:24,034
Scott: it has to be content.

653
00:48:24,074 --> 00:48:35,088
Scott: you can actually get yeah and get the rights to to do legally and Then charge money for that exclusive content and have it be content that people actually want and that's not easy to do.

654
00:48:35,429 --> 00:48:44,950
Rym: Yep So I think you're gonna see a lot of online gaming cons over the next year You're gonna see a moderate number of online like generic nerd conventions.

655
00:48:45,493 --> 00:48:54,645
Rym: Don't think you're see gonna see a lot of successful online Anime conventions specifically if anisee couldn't get a full Lupin movie to be screened.

656
00:48:54,886 --> 00:48:56,310
Rym: Yeah, what chance do you have?

657
00:48:56,770 --> 00:49:00,550
Scott: It's like Otakon can get full anime movies to be screened at Otakon.

658
00:49:00,851 --> 00:49:02,257
Scott: Can they get it to be done online?

659
00:49:02,277 --> 00:49:05,670
Scott: it like pay Otakon ten bucks and you'll get to see a Lupin movie, right?

660
00:49:06,191 --> 00:49:06,995
Scott: No, they can't do it.

661
00:49:07,035 --> 00:49:08,845
Scott: There's no way they can get them to convince them to do that.

662
00:49:08,905 --> 00:49:09,790
Scott: Fantasy can't yeah.

663
00:49:10,771 --> 00:49:11,553
