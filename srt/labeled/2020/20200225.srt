1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,377
Rym: It's Tuesday, February 25th, 2020.

2
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:17,947
Rym: I'm Rym, I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights Tonight Randomizers, like all of them.

3
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:20,522
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:23,395 --> 00:00:30,090
Rym: We are at the end of a surprisingly long Dense convention season for GeekNights, like way more than usual

5
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:34,530
Scott: Because some conventions, you know, start at PAX West in Seattle is normal on Labor Day

6
00:00:34,851 --> 00:00:38,890
Rym: But then like all the other conventions just converge into like one a month for a very

7
00:00:39,251 --> 00:00:40,898
Scott: Mostly because PAX East is early.

8
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:47,630
Scott: PAX East was early and then we have Unplugged like around like Because Unplugged and South are, you know, basically on top of each other.

9
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,705
Rym: Yeah, and also Magfest was early relative to when Magfest has been in the past.

10
00:00:51,725 --> 00:00:53,170
Scott: South and Magfest are even more on top of each other.

11
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,103
Rym: Yeah, I worry next year South and Magfest might actually overlap.

12
00:00:56,224 --> 00:01:03,930
Scott: No, because uh Magfest is later and it's not New Year's but it's also not MLK Day, which is when South pretty much always is.

13
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:04,813
Rym: Yeah, I gotta check.

14
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:07,783
Scott: South is MLK Day as often as West is Labor Day.

15
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:14,089
Scott: Yeah, not guaranteed No, but it's as long as, you know, Magfest is not MLK Day.

16
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:23,848
Rym: I'm pretty safe with South not overlapping it directly But what this means is what I haven't been playing all the kinds of games that I normally play because my like.

17
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:24,731
Rym: I've been really Busy.

18
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:25,814
Rym: just my life has been busy.

19
00:01:26,376 --> 00:01:31,150
Rym: So I've been mostly playing like if I play Overwatch I play in the arcade like RNG mode.

20
00:01:32,433 --> 00:01:36,630
Rym: I play like Slay the Spire on the Train or Genshin Clever or Dopple Clever.

21
00:01:37,512 --> 00:01:40,624
Rym: I can't get above 200 in Genshin Clever 2.

22
00:01:40,624 --> 00:01:42,070
Scott: Where did you even get Genshin Clever 2?

23
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:42,934
Rym: It's just on Android.

24
00:01:42,954 --> 00:01:43,939
Rym: It's been on Android forever.

25
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:44,501
Scott: Oh has it?

26
00:01:44,662 --> 00:01:46,210
Rym: Yeah, I have both of them.

27
00:01:46,521 --> 00:01:48,776
Rym: Okay They were like a dollar fifty like they were.

28
00:01:49,638 --> 00:01:51,383
Rym: I can get I can reliably like.

29
00:01:51,424 --> 00:01:56,562
Rym: my average in Genshin Clever is like 270 280 like I can get that really reliable.

30
00:01:56,622 --> 00:01:57,064
Rym: Oh, there it is.

31
00:01:57,104 --> 00:01:57,907
Scott: Twice as clever.

32
00:01:57,927 --> 00:01:58,550
Rym: Twice as clever.

33
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:03,184
Rym: 187 is the highest score I have ever been able to achieve so far.

34
00:02:03,526 --> 00:02:04,590
Rym: That game is really hard.

35
00:02:05,005 --> 00:02:09,506
Scott: Yeah Now someone posted a thing online that was like this is how to get the maximum score.

36
00:02:09,526 --> 00:02:10,470
Scott: that the first one.

37
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:11,414
Scott: Here's a little.

38
00:02:11,494 --> 00:02:12,459
Scott: here's a little graphic.

39
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,544
Rym: Oh, what did he say?

40
00:02:13,785 --> 00:02:14,770
Scott: Luck is the rest.

41
00:02:14,931 --> 00:02:17,303
Rym: But yeah luck is the rest because I did start penciling in.

42
00:02:17,584 --> 00:02:18,690
Rym: what if I could choose my rolls?

43
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:24,970
Rym: Yeah, you can make a full web game Like if you just roll right you can have a ridiculously high score.

44
00:02:26,631 --> 00:02:38,790
Rym: But I do have a very specific strategy that will reliably like 90% of the time get me well over 200 no matter what even with really bad rolls Mmm, so I basically only play that strategy.

45
00:02:39,871 --> 00:02:43,824
Rym: I did try alternate strategies and I did some like math plotting like.

46
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:44,345
Rym: is there a way?

47
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:51,490
Rym: because the game comes down to both those games I realized come down to the economy of how many dice can you score?

48
00:02:51,891 --> 00:03:00,486
Rym: Yeah, and anything you can do to score one more die somehow without like Sacrificing something fundamental is just how you get your score up.

49
00:03:00,728 --> 00:03:03,757
Rym: Yeah, and It all other than that.

50
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:05,403
Rym: It's just luck mitigation like Yahtzee.

51
00:03:05,684 --> 00:03:06,869
Rym: Yeah, I like these games a lot.

52
00:03:07,951 --> 00:03:10,041
Rym: So, uh, there is actually a lot of big news.

53
00:03:10,121 --> 00:03:20,139
Rym: as you know PAX East is this week Like we're not gonna do a show on Thursday because we will already have had most of our first day of packs By the time we normally record gig nights.

54
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,730
Scott: Yeah, but maybe you know, the Internet's good at PAX East.

55
00:03:22,851 --> 00:03:27,190
Scott: I might experiment with some, you know posting some content from PAX East.

56
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,630
Scott: Yeah with their high quality Wi-Fi that is in the convention center.

57
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:35,330
Scott: But we're gonna do it lower and follow us at every single place that we exist to see if that happens.

58
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:40,030
Rym: Like I'm not bringing microphones or video equipment or like I'm not bringing the usual kit.

59
00:03:40,371 --> 00:03:42,680
Rym: Yeah, my bag has mostly board games in it.

60
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:51,004
Rym: Yep, but the big news is pretty recently Sony just outright said they're pulling they're giving up on PAX East.

61
00:03:51,245 --> 00:03:52,670
Rym: They're completely pulling out.

62
00:03:52,913 --> 00:03:53,950
Rym: They will have zero present.

63
00:03:53,990 --> 00:04:05,986
Scott: So if you looked at the play state the map of the expo hall previously There were these two three two giant blocks and one kind of normal block under the stairs because I had some big Announcements and they were really all said PlayStation on them.

64
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:07,493
Scott: and then it's like well We're pulling out.

65
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:11,230
Scott: and now the expo hall map has changed and none of those PlayStation things are there.

66
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:18,670
Scott: I know the aisles in the front of the expo hall where the mega booths are not the indie mega booth The actual industry mega booths, right?

67
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:27,350
Rym: Are much more widely Because there is no way to fill in a gap like that at a con like pack with a last minute with a week's notice.

68
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:34,190
Scott: Hey Anyone want to buy a giant expensive booth that I would like a week's notice and Be able to bring everything necessary to fill that space.

69
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:39,887
Rym: It's like no like it was a. and what's interesting is while there is the coronavirus global issue.

70
00:04:40,448 --> 00:04:45,870
Rym: There was no Precipitating news in the US of any kind about this, right?

71
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:50,170
Scott: It's strange how if you look at coronavirus stuff just around the world in general, right?

72
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:54,710
Scott: What we see is pretty much very few places or at least very new.

73
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:55,313
Scott: I guess it's not.

74
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,663
Scott: it's not newsworthy when someone handles it correctly.

75
00:04:57,683 --> 00:05:05,438
Scott: every single news story you see is either about someone not doing enough or Showing doing too much, right?

76
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:08,109
Rym: So there aren't really any places doing too much though?

77
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:19,527
Scott: No, so for example, right you have like Japan not checking the doctors who are on the boats taking care of people Even though the doctor in China, they're like, oh doctors know what to do.

78
00:05:19,607 --> 00:05:20,230
Scott: They won't have it.

79
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:24,309
Scott: We don't need to test them except the doctor who discovered it died of it already.

80
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:26,375
Rym: Yeah, but what I can say?

81
00:05:26,516 --> 00:05:27,499
Scott: and then you have people.

82
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:31,470
Scott: you have situations like this where PlayStation Sony is like pull it out.

83
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:36,717
Rym: It's like Boston is perfectly safe Because of travel to Boston.

84
00:05:37,098 --> 00:05:37,720
Rym: that's it bought.

85
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:42,628
Rym: the fact that it's in Boston literally does not matter at all would not matter What city on earth the event is in?

86
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:53,805
Rym: Because I note Facebook has also pulled out of PAX East meaning oculus has pulled out of PAX East meaning another area They normally run is now empty and PAX is scrambling to fill it in the VR space.

87
00:05:54,106 --> 00:06:10,150
Rym: Mm-hmm you know, I work in capital markets is my day job and Generally global companies around the entire world regardless of where they are have Drastically curtailed any official travel by employees to events of any kind.

88
00:06:10,561 --> 00:06:12,800
Rym: No big gatherings of people anywhere.

89
00:06:13,182 --> 00:06:34,841
Rym: because and the main reason is While the risk is relatively low because it's a global issue and because it's spread so easily The issue is every major convention or like industry event where a lot of people go Especially events that draw people from a broad area or an international place or that are just very dense are a Significant increased risk relative to normal times.

90
00:06:35,423 --> 00:06:36,689
Scott: So it's still.

91
00:06:37,952 --> 00:06:41,164
Scott: You know, it would make sense if the convention was you know somewhere.

92
00:06:41,184 --> 00:06:44,490
Rym: no, like I just said it does there is It literally doesn't matter.

93
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:50,067
Rym: It's probably no more dangerous to have it in a city where there are more cases than in a city like Boston.

94
00:06:50,107 --> 00:06:57,647
Scott: is a equation Moronic level of caution to the point where it's like one of those people who's like, you know Wearing gloves and walk around in a bubble.

95
00:06:57,707 --> 00:07:00,722
Scott: It's like Idiots taking, you know taking too much.

96
00:07:00,742 --> 00:07:02,130
Rym: think you know anything about this.

97
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:05,182
Scott: He's too much caution is just as stupid as being not enough cause.

98
00:07:05,363 --> 00:07:07,150
Rym: this is really too much caution.

99
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,740
Rym: It does not cause Sony anything.

100
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,350
Rym: No, it doesn't cost them anything.

101
00:07:10,511 --> 00:07:13,425
Scott: It's just still really stupidly too cautious for no reason.

102
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:14,330
Scott: It makes them look stupid.

103
00:07:14,744 --> 00:07:16,135
Scott: No I don't think it actually the same way.

104
00:07:16,175 --> 00:07:22,450
Scott: someone who's taking too much caution in any area of life looks stupid like someone wearing ten Helmets and like wrapping foam around their body.

105
00:07:23,012 --> 00:07:34,430
Rym: the other reason why companies pull out of this stuff is that the people that they normally send to events something broadly like a Lot of events globally have been cancelled and a lot of companies have put the overabundance of caution.

106
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,790
Rym: No, I think it's an adequate like amount of caution.

107
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:47,293
Rym: It's overabundance of caution depending on the case by now because these are all also events where the people that companies send I'm not talking about you and me is like tax attendees But companies.

108
00:07:47,855 --> 00:07:53,670
Rym: it tends to be a relatively small set of people who go to all the events and travel a lot.

109
00:07:53,971 --> 00:08:01,358
Rym: The danger is that super spreader situation of people from a company go to one convention Then another one then another one then another one need.

110
00:08:01,619 --> 00:08:04,650
Scott: they just don't travel to a place that there's a lot of virus.

111
00:08:04,811 --> 00:08:07,060
Rym: I just said that's not part of the equation.

112
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,104
Rym: You don't know shit about this.

113
00:08:08,124 --> 00:08:09,650
Rym: You're just you're just talking out of your ass.

114
00:08:09,693 --> 00:08:13,482
Scott: Yeah No If it was a real danger then packs should just not happen.

115
00:08:14,044 --> 00:08:19,550
Rym: if the packs if it's not dangerous Did I not just say there's no significant danger to the attendees the day.

116
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,938
Scott: There's no danger to the attendees.

117
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:25,590
Scott: then there's no danger to attendees who happen to work for a company.

118
00:08:25,811 --> 00:08:29,605
Rym: Understand anything about like threat files or the stupidest thing.

119
00:08:29,646 --> 00:08:34,788
Scott: if attendees are not threatened Then people who happen to work for Sony who are also attendees are also not threatened.

120
00:08:35,894 --> 00:08:37,383
Scott: That is just not basic logic.

121
00:08:37,443 --> 00:08:39,817
Rym: That's yeah, that's wrong And you don't know shit that's wrong.

122
00:08:39,876 --> 00:08:42,150
Scott: impact should be canceled because it's not safe to be there.

123
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,620
Scott: It's either safe to be there or it isn't.

124
00:08:44,063 --> 00:08:49,530
Rym: uh, that's like Really ridiculous reductive bullshit baby thinking.

125
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,198
Rym: Common sense like the.

126
00:08:52,238 --> 00:08:52,860
Rym: no, it's not.

127
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,246
Scott: that says if it's safe to be.

128
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:56,596
Scott: if it's not safe to be there No, we shouldn't have the event.

129
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:59,390
Scott: if it is safe to be there then it's safe for any human being to be there.

130
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:00,734
Rym: That's all right.

131
00:09:00,955 --> 00:09:02,079
Rym: I think you're stupid.

132
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,550
Rym: Okay, this like I think Sony is stupid.

133
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:08,450
Scott: They look like little babies who are like, oh, we're so afraid we're gonna hide from the world.

134
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,157
Rym: So you clearly didn't listen to any words.

135
00:09:10,218 --> 00:09:10,961
Rym: I said about.

136
00:09:11,121 --> 00:09:13,110
Scott: I'm saying the words you said were wrong and stupid.

137
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:15,921
Scott: Okay, if you're so afraid, why don't you why you go?

138
00:09:15,961 --> 00:09:18,030
Scott: and maybe you shouldn't be going to pegs you work for a company.

139
00:09:18,371 --> 00:09:20,038
Scott: Why isn't your company preventing you from going?

140
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,508
Rym: most of our business travel has been canceled.

141
00:09:22,849 --> 00:09:24,236
Scott: Uh-huh Well, how come they're not preventing you?

142
00:09:24,256 --> 00:09:25,362
Scott: if they should buy that logic.

143
00:09:25,382 --> 00:09:26,770
Scott: They should prevent you from going east.

144
00:09:27,171 --> 00:09:34,332
Rym: Uh, well because I am not part of a small team that travels to a lot of places on behalf of the company in a short Span of time.

145
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:34,773
Rym: Yeah.

146
00:09:35,235 --> 00:09:39,167
Rym: Also I am banned from traveling to a bunch of specific places for the foreseeable.

147
00:09:39,187 --> 00:09:40,310
Scott: Well, that is common sense.

148
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,870
Scott: I think Everyone should be banned from going.

149
00:09:45,231 --> 00:09:50,910
Rym: I don't think you understand the like basic difference between a generalized threats profile versus like a more specific one.

150
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:55,730
Rym: Like you just don't know anything about this space and you're talking out of your ass.

151
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,624
Rym: You're like being the epitome of the white dude explaining something.

152
00:09:58,644 --> 00:09:59,508
Rym: You don't know anything about.

153
00:09:59,528 --> 00:10:01,499
Scott: I mean I don't even care if Sony goes or not.

154
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,370
Scott: The point is they just look really stupid.

155
00:10:04,811 --> 00:10:07,102
Scott: And tendos not pulling out Nintendo's showing up just fine.

156
00:10:07,122 --> 00:10:07,885
Scott: They don't seem to give a shit.

157
00:10:07,966 --> 00:10:08,870
Scott: They're Japanese company.

158
00:10:09,171 --> 00:10:10,295
Scott: How come Nintendo's not pulling out?

159
00:10:10,335 --> 00:10:11,279
Scott: Are they stupid Nintendo?

160
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,423
Scott: You're saying Nintendo shouldn't go.

161
00:10:12,704 --> 00:10:14,130
Scott: so because this Sony's all smart.

162
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,013
Scott: Is that what you're saying?

163
00:10:15,193 --> 00:10:16,759
Rym: The difference is probably.

164
00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:20,090
Rym: I mean, I don't know the details of the marketing teams in these different companies.

165
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:20,794
Scott: I guess I was going.

166
00:10:20,915 --> 00:10:21,559
Rym: they're not pulling out.

167
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,050
Rym: Yeah, but again, like I said, I don't you know I don't know the differences between the marketing teams.

168
00:10:25,111 --> 00:10:34,498
Rym: I don't work for any of these companies but some companies have a central team that goes all around the world to do this stuff and some companies have Regional specific teams.

169
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:40,690
Rym: and if you have purely like regional specific It's a lot safer to like, you know, I have to worry about this stuff nearly as much.

170
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:47,729
Rym: So if you have an entirely US staff that moves entirely to a US location That's much less of a threat vector.

171
00:10:48,071 --> 00:10:53,050
Rym: Then a team that travels to the US to do the thing then travels to another like third country to do the thing.

172
00:10:53,271 --> 00:11:00,245
Scott: As long as you don't travel to one of the countries of the diseases all over It's not as the US has like the third most cases and there are.

173
00:11:00,305 --> 00:11:01,690
Rym: there were cases in Boston.

174
00:11:01,991 --> 00:11:05,484
Scott: So if you want to do not think there were not see any.

175
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:06,447
Rym: yeah, there were two.

176
00:11:06,488 --> 00:11:07,090
Rym: What do you read?

177
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:10,670
Rym: I have access to like real like live industry data about this.

178
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,379
Rym: I can pull it up right now if you want to see it.

179
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,450
Scott: Anyway, let us move on to the next news.

180
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,539
Rym: So what's interesting about this though?

181
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,830
Rym: Is that from the packs perspective?

182
00:11:19,571 --> 00:11:25,078
Rym: It's a blow in the sense that a lot of the people who go to cons like packs They're really only there for the expo hall.

183
00:11:25,179 --> 00:11:26,403
Rym: Like I think that's always.

184
00:11:26,443 --> 00:11:28,110
Rym: that's something that I think is stupid like attendees.

185
00:11:28,251 --> 00:11:29,907
Scott: well that we've always said that that stupid.

186
00:11:29,967 --> 00:11:39,322
Rym: but The kinds of people who only go to an expo hall are the kinds of people who really want to play like the game that Sony's been hyping up for months saying we're gonna have it at PAX.

187
00:11:39,342 --> 00:11:40,046
Rym: You can play it.

188
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:46,089
Rym: and They're the kinds of people who don't read websites and will not know that Sony is not there.

189
00:11:46,954 --> 00:11:57,749
Rym: I really feel for the poor enforcers We're gonna be standing in the area where Sony was gonna be having to explain to a lot of really angry and dense nerds Why Sony isn't there?

190
00:11:58,913 --> 00:12:01,290
Rym: Like that is gonna be an interesting thing to see play out.

191
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:06,890
Rym: I'm curious how many people will like just not know Sony pulled out and show up and be mad about it.

192
00:12:08,231 --> 00:12:09,997
Rym: Mmm, the other interesting thing that happened.

193
00:12:10,258 --> 00:12:15,313
Rym: Is that the mayor of Boston like Agrees with me.

194
00:12:15,774 --> 00:12:18,522
Rym: Well, not really cuz one what he said.

195
00:12:18,562 --> 00:12:24,685
Rym: like he's getting a lot of flack for the kind of bullshitty thing He said about this because he accused an Asian owned company.

196
00:12:24,725 --> 00:12:25,690
Scott: Well, that's all that's true.

197
00:12:26,071 --> 00:12:30,107
Rym: Like his whole letter is basically this plays into Asian stereotypes.

198
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:34,340
Rym: Yeah, and Like the response from Sony there is racism going.

199
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,523
Rym: What do you think owns us?

200
00:12:36,085 --> 00:12:36,366
Rym: What?

201
00:12:36,887 --> 00:12:37,650
Rym: what's your point?

202
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:48,510
Rym: Like so the mayor of Boston even sent a letter to the CEO of Sony Like mad at him for Pope for having the company pull out of the event.

203
00:12:49,173 --> 00:12:51,202
Rym: I don't think the mayor of Boston understands that much about this.

204
00:12:51,222 --> 00:12:57,862
Rym: The only interesting point about that is that The mayor of Boston cares that much about packs.

205
00:12:57,962 --> 00:12:58,623
Scott: Yeah, that's the thing.

206
00:12:58,664 --> 00:12:59,726
Scott: I don't understand right is?

207
00:12:59,806 --> 00:13:04,002
Scott: I think packs is a Does not lose right, you know?

208
00:13:04,042 --> 00:13:09,150
Scott: forget about whether they should or they shouldn't Understand how convention centers were right?

209
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:15,090
Scott: But here's the thing is that pecs doesn't make or lose money whether Sony shows up or not.

210
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,514
Scott: There's tons of video giant.

211
00:13:16,554 --> 00:13:28,250
Scott: video game companies aren't coming that used to come or right and it's like pecs sold out with or without Right packs used to sell it not selling less tickets because PlayStation pulls out.

212
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:35,528
Scott: They're not gonna sell less tickets next year because Boston makes the same money off packs Pretty much no matter who shows up and less like.

213
00:13:35,569 --> 00:13:36,892
Rym: no No It's even worse.

214
00:13:36,953 --> 00:13:45,526
Rym: it was like the whole industry pulls out and is basically like a barren expo hall Which could happen because a lot more companies are planning to pull out of GDC.

215
00:13:45,566 --> 00:13:46,530
Rym: probably well GDC.

216
00:13:46,691 --> 00:13:49,050
Scott: Yeah, I don't know why they're either but you know

217
00:13:49,230 --> 00:14:01,090
Rym: GDC actually has an even worse threat profile because GDC doesn't have like normal attendees as much as it has like Reps from the marketing teams of all these international companies all showing up and doing a bunch of meetings together.

218
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:08,145
Rym: Well, it has way less people though Yeah But I would consider GDC to probably be a worst threat vector for this particular kind of illness.

219
00:14:08,266 --> 00:14:09,269
Scott: pandemic expert Rym.

220
00:14:09,329 --> 00:14:12,539
Rym: over here I mean, I was the chief risk officer of a company for a while.

221
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:20,039
Rym: I am formally trained in risk assessment Like yes, that is true That literally is true.

222
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,329
Rym: That's part of my job.

223
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:25,004
Rym: But you don't believe me, you know, yes, the government is calling up Rym.

224
00:14:25,044 --> 00:14:26,130
Scott: What should we do about the coronavirus?

225
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:27,054
Scott: It's such an expert.

226
00:14:27,094 --> 00:14:28,079
Rym: Why would the government call me?

227
00:14:28,099 --> 00:14:29,124
Rym: I'm not a government official.

228
00:14:29,205 --> 00:14:30,270
Rym: I did that for a company.

229
00:14:30,451 --> 00:14:30,993
Rym: Yeah, okay.

230
00:14:31,173 --> 00:14:32,237
Scott: No one's calling you for help.

231
00:14:32,257 --> 00:14:32,639
Scott: You're not.

232
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,787
Rym: my company paid me to do this.

233
00:14:35,048 --> 00:14:36,398
Scott: Uh-huh Oh someone paid you.

234
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:37,770
Scott: therefore you're an expert, you know.

235
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:39,813
Scott: Therefore you're right.

236
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:41,658
Scott: Someone pays you money.

237
00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:41,999
Scott: Therefore.

238
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:42,480
Scott: You're right.

239
00:14:42,601 --> 00:14:42,902
Scott: Okay.

240
00:14:43,002 --> 00:14:45,790
Rym: No, all I'm saying is that I am a professional risk assessment.

241
00:14:46,956 --> 00:14:48,350
Scott: All that means is someone paid you money.

242
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:51,221
Scott: That's all that's required to be a professional is to have someone pay you money.

243
00:14:51,261 --> 00:14:53,470
Scott: that gives you no credentials whatsoever.

244
00:14:53,932 --> 00:14:56,808
Scott: Someone can pay me to wash their car doesn't mean I'm a car washing expert.

245
00:14:56,848 --> 00:14:59,259
Rym: So you don't Doctors are you don't trust?

246
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,609
Scott: because they're paid.

247
00:15:01,611 --> 00:15:01,993
Rym: So what?

248
00:15:02,073 --> 00:15:06,550
Scott: why do you trust a doctor that the doctor went to medical school for a zillion fucking years and work their ass off?

249
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:11,646
Scott: Did you go and study virus spreading or whatever, you know in school for six?

250
00:15:12,067 --> 00:15:12,849
Scott: No to ten guys.

251
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,799
Rym: I learned generalized corporate risk assessment.

252
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:16,521
Rym: That's a very different.

253
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:17,866
Scott: You know, nothing about viruses.

254
00:15:18,047 --> 00:15:19,070
Scott: No viruses are.

255
00:15:20,695 --> 00:15:21,898
Rym: You don't need to know that there's.

256
00:15:22,179 --> 00:15:25,710
Rym: you can just read data about this like there's data feed.

257
00:15:25,794 --> 00:15:30,470
Scott: Oh, man If reading data just made me know everything and be an expert instead of studying something for a long time

258
00:15:31,092 --> 00:15:43,050
Rym: You learn in risk assessment are like how to interpret data about risk to enable to figure out what the actual Real threat is to your particular domain or your particular company and then make decisions based on that.

259
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:44,337
Rym: Like that's what that is.

260
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:44,941
Rym: That's a job.

261
00:15:45,081 --> 00:15:46,610
Scott: Yeah, it's a medical risk.

262
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:50,109
Scott: I'm gonna contact a medical person not just some Rym who read a data.

263
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:54,409
Rym: Don't think you know what risk officers do in companies or who they are?

264
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:56,258
Scott: Yeah, I know who they are people like Rym.

265
00:15:56,299 --> 00:15:57,505
Scott: We think they know what they don't know.

266
00:15:57,525 --> 00:15:58,550
Rym: Yeah, I didn't know.

267
00:15:58,611 --> 00:15:59,767
Rym: That's why I got trained in it.

268
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:05,952
Scott: Oh, so your training is equivalent to the training of an expert who went to school for a very long time There.

269
00:16:06,112 --> 00:16:07,920
Rym: most people don't go to school for a very long time.

270
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:09,025
Scott: doctors do you said.

271
00:16:09,066 --> 00:16:10,030
Scott: why do I trust doctors?

272
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:11,796
Rym: Yeah, there's a lot of shit.

273
00:16:11,836 --> 00:16:12,640
Rym: Are you a doctor?

274
00:16:12,821 --> 00:16:16,761
Rym: No, so if you sound the same over I mean if you want to be anti-intellectual and weird you can.

275
00:16:16,982 --> 00:16:21,780
Scott: you're the one who's claiming to know something I guess I do know about like risk assessment.

276
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:22,342
Scott: Okay?

277
00:16:22,944 --> 00:16:24,650
Scott: Okay, coronavirus Rym everybody.

278
00:16:25,072 --> 00:16:25,795
Rym: I didn't say.

279
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,442
Rym: I didn't say I'm an expert in coronavirus.

280
00:16:27,482 --> 00:16:31,870
Rym: I'm an expert in corporate risk assessment Specifically pandemics and epidemics.

281
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:34,137
Scott: Oh, you're an expert on pandemics, huh?

282
00:16:34,558 --> 00:16:39,157
Rym: Now in the in the specific and narrow domain of corporate risk assessment Uh-huh.

283
00:16:39,464 --> 00:16:42,082
Rym: Okay I had to draft a plan on what to do.

284
00:16:42,142 --> 00:16:55,202
Rym: in fact right now because you know There's a global the entire finance industry everyone's pulled out their BCP plans for these kinds of epidemics and they're said like everything's set up in case where everyone has to Do the pandemic like procedure?

285
00:16:55,624 --> 00:16:56,730
Rym: There's a pandemic procedure.

286
00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:13,510
Rym: There's a button someone get hit and then me and everyone in the company that I work for now where I don't plan this But I trust the people who are paid to do it They will like they'll hit a button and then I have to follow a procedure where I'm not allowed to go to work And I have to work from home and there's all these things I have to do and everyone in the company has a different playbook.

287
00:17:13,711 --> 00:17:14,273
Scott: There's a button.

288
00:17:14,295 --> 00:17:15,762
Scott: you should find that button in the office.

289
00:17:15,782 --> 00:17:16,890
Scott: I mean, it's you don't to go to work.

290
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,276
Rym: Yeah, it's up some keys on a keyboard.

291
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:19,642
Rym: I'd still have to work from home.

292
00:17:20,326 --> 00:17:21,250
Rym: I don't get to just not work.

293
00:17:21,672 --> 00:17:23,324
Rym: I don't actually need to go to the office to do a lot.

294
00:17:23,344 --> 00:17:26,773
Scott: I don't push the button I'm telling you, but if it was such a button I'd be pushing.

295
00:17:26,794 --> 00:17:34,890
Rym: the other thing the mayor might have been mad about is Reputational risk to Boston and the fact that the news said Oh big company won't travel to Boston.

296
00:17:35,171 --> 00:17:43,810
Rym: But if that's actually what the mayor of Boston is mad about the mayor of Boston Doesn't seem to actually understand how companies work or how events work.

297
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:48,790
Scott: Well, I mean the thing is I don't think that hurts the reputation of Boston, right?

298
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:49,292
Scott: It's like.

299
00:17:50,057 --> 00:17:51,888
Scott: it's like people think there's a big they make up.

300
00:17:51,908 --> 00:17:56,164
Scott: well So like there is a mind they think they've been sliding.

301
00:17:56,204 --> 00:17:56,987
Scott: everyone's like what the fuck.

302
00:17:57,027 --> 00:18:08,290
Rym: so Scott you realize though there has been like in the last month a drastic downturn in Tourism and visiting revenue in like every major city on earth basically entirely because of coronavirus.

303
00:18:08,518 --> 00:18:13,706
Scott: Oh, yeah People aren't traveling because people are paranoid and traveling less sometimes with good reasons.

304
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:14,770
Scott: Sometimes not with good reason.

305
00:18:14,951 --> 00:18:16,057
Rym: Yeah, people are traveling less.

306
00:18:16,077 --> 00:18:18,489
Rym: They're spending less eating at restaurants and that's it.

307
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:21,950
Rym: But that of course but the real danger times the racist reasons?

308
00:18:22,444 --> 00:18:30,266
Rym: Yeah pretty rarely it seems like it's mostly Just generalized caution coupled with the real economic damage is coming from supply chain misses.

309
00:18:30,466 --> 00:18:31,590
Scott: That's also true.

310
00:18:33,337 --> 00:18:41,568
Rym: so Pax East issued a statement about you know The safety of packs and everything and what it basically boils down to is what it boils down to at all conventions.

311
00:18:41,849 --> 00:18:50,470
Rym: if you're going To Pax do the same thing you do at every gaming convention Don't touch other nerds and don't shake hands with people cars and wash your hands

312
00:18:50,551 --> 00:18:52,887
Scott: Even if you're not gonna get the corona virus if you're gonna get

313
00:18:52,907 --> 00:18:53,149
Rym: the flu

314
00:18:53,471 --> 00:18:54,574
Scott: You could you could get anything.

315
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:56,321
Scott: if I write there was swine flu effects.

316
00:18:56,361 --> 00:18:58,909
Rym: Yeah, but a bunch of our friends got it got diagnosed.

317
00:18:59,251 --> 00:19:04,110
Rym: I remember I was on the phone with Robert Gu listing the flight numbers of our two friends that were on it, right?

318
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:08,390
Scott: It's like, you know that was but that was a time when swine flu was like in the area already.

319
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:08,752
Scott: It wasn't.

320
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:12,390
Scott: well, I wasn't like oh swine flu's in the other side of the world and we got it.

321
00:19:12,611 --> 00:19:14,870
Scott: So so do you remember that actually?

322
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:22,802
Rym: One student I think it was from U of W who went to Pax Spread it at Pax and then Pax was actually a right.

323
00:19:22,822 --> 00:19:24,730
Scott: but the point is it was already there to begin with.

324
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:25,674
Scott: Well, yeah, it wasn't like.

325
00:19:25,694 --> 00:19:27,181
Rym: it was not widespread there.

326
00:19:27,201 --> 00:19:28,909
Rym: It was not known to be there.

327
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:30,638
Scott: Well, I mean there was someone who had it there.

328
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:32,145
Rym: Yes, and they didn't know yet.

329
00:19:32,186 --> 00:19:33,050
Rym: They went if they were sick.

330
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:33,773
Rym: They went to Pax.

331
00:19:33,813 --> 00:19:42,546
Rym: they spread it to a few people and because it's Pax it spread to a lot of people at Pax and Then because it was a convention it spread to much of the coasts right like rapidly.

332
00:19:42,586 --> 00:19:43,750
Rym: Pax was a big part of that spread.

333
00:19:44,112 --> 00:19:48,261
Rym: So wash your hands don't cough in people's faces faces.

334
00:19:48,975 --> 00:19:53,829
Rym: The really the thing people don't seem to realize You can put like those masks or more to protect other people from you.

335
00:19:54,371 --> 00:20:02,529
Rym: But the real way you get things like this is not so much someone coughing on you It's don't touch your fucking face after you touch things.

336
00:20:02,831 --> 00:20:05,921
Rym: Yeah, like if you can just train yourself and it's really hard.

337
00:20:06,322 --> 00:20:07,466
Scott: Oh, yeah, I tell my face.

338
00:20:07,486 --> 00:20:08,530
Scott: Look I just touch my face.

339
00:20:08,894 --> 00:20:13,181
Rym: I touch my face all the time like Just think the whole time you're at Pax.

340
00:20:13,663 --> 00:20:14,466
Rym: Don't touch my face.

341
00:20:14,687 --> 00:20:17,543
Rym: Don't touch my face Don't because basically don't put salt.

342
00:20:17,564 --> 00:20:21,650
Scott: my number one place The virus is gonna get is on your hands because your hands are always touching shit.

343
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,677
Scott: You're touching cards that you pass around the table.

344
00:20:23,697 --> 00:20:26,005
Scott: You're touching arms on chairs.

345
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:27,290
Scott: You're touching tables.

346
00:20:27,651 --> 00:20:32,066
Scott: It's touching all kinds of shit subway poles some railings on escalators.

347
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:33,290
Scott: Those are the worst right?

348
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:35,238
Scott: You're touching the flushers and the toilet.

349
00:20:35,258 --> 00:20:39,257
Scott: you're touching all kinds of shit and your hands are disgusting Even if you just wash them, right?

350
00:20:39,277 --> 00:20:40,301
Scott: It's all kinds of the hands.

Scott: the rest of your body's covered in clothes.

353
00:20:45,072 --> 00:20:45,695
Rym: It's not you're not.

354
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:51,235
Scott: I'm often you touching something with your knee or your elbow Right, you're not doing not as much as with the hand But it's it's my hand.

355
00:20:51,336 --> 00:20:54,450
Scott: nothing can get into your body if it's just on your hand.

356
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:56,504
Scott: Let's you got a big cut on your hand or something, but it's hand.

357
00:20:56,524 --> 00:20:57,430
Rym: There's no hole.

358
00:20:57,712 --> 00:21:00,730
Rym: It's specifically hand to mucus memory a hand to face.

359
00:21:01,272 --> 00:21:02,638
Rym: That is how you most people get.

360
00:21:02,658 --> 00:21:05,450
Scott: there's no way for the virus to get from the hand into the body easily.

361
00:21:05,813 --> 00:21:16,261
Scott: But as soon as you put the hand on the face It's like let me bring the most disgusting stuff that I've collected and put it right here the entry hole into my body Right, and that's how you get in trouble.

362
00:21:16,362 --> 00:21:19,196
Scott: So just don't touch your face So don't let other people touch your face.

363
00:21:19,276 --> 00:21:20,782
Rym: wash your hands like often.

364
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:22,730
Rym: like however often you think you need to wash your hands.

00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:23,193
Rym: Just wash it.

366
00:21:23,233 --> 00:21:23,958
Rym: just do it more often.

367
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:25,650
Scott: I already wash my hands at packs like crazy.

368
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:30,997
Rym: Yeah, pretty much every time and however long you're a hand washer need to wash your hands Like how long they need to be underwater.

369
00:21:31,278 --> 00:21:31,961
Scott: just double it.

370
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:33,690
Scott: learn to wash your hands properly.

371
00:21:33,872 --> 00:21:35,164
Scott: Go to YouTube watch a video.

372
00:21:35,225 --> 00:21:39,043
Scott: hand-washing Friction is the most important factor in hand-washing.

373
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:44,830
Rym: Yeah, I remember when I worked in the hospital I had to take classes on like how to wash my hands and you ever see a doctor wash their hands before surgery.

374
00:21:44,991 --> 00:21:45,594
Scott: Yeah, right.

375
00:21:45,635 --> 00:21:46,983
Scott: They're mostly scrubbing.

376
00:21:47,003 --> 00:21:55,620
Rym: Oh, and then when I worked in Scrubbing I worked in a NICU for a while like an infant like premature, baby Like and they make you wash your hands like crazy.

377
00:21:55,721 --> 00:21:57,570
Scott: Oh you wear ten gloves.

378
00:21:58,272 --> 00:21:59,617
Scott: The procedure don't touch the babies.

379
00:21:59,837 --> 00:22:07,650
Rym: because I wasn't trained in how to like prepare to enter that area I had to have a nurse escort me and wash with me every time I went into that room.

380
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:13,288
Rym: Imagine like seven minutes of scrubbing on your hands and arms before we could even walk into a room.

381
00:22:13,429 --> 00:22:15,505
Scott: Yep So it doesn't mean a baby gets sick they done.

382
00:22:15,525 --> 00:22:19,020
Scott: Yeah so you it's like you get a cold.

383
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:27,665
Rym: it's like I you got a cold brand new baby and If someone tries to shake hands with you at a convention just don't like.

384
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:29,210
Rym: elbow bump is way better.

385
00:22:29,331 --> 00:22:32,508
Rym: Like don't touch people's grubby hands for all the reasons we just described.

386
00:22:32,608 --> 00:22:34,174
Rym: Yeah It's not news.

387
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:36,281
Rym: In fact official advice from penny arcade.

388
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:39,170
Rym: Do not let a stranger's weeping pustules drip into your urethra.

389
00:22:39,471 --> 00:22:43,965
Scott: Yeah, so remember that really entering through the urethra would be pretty hard for a virus.

390
00:22:44,005 --> 00:22:45,209
Scott: I feel like it's more likely to.

391
00:22:45,229 --> 00:22:49,320
Rym: uh, All I'm gonna say is wash your hands before your jacket.

392
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:58,270
Rym: if you're a pax and you're the kind of person who jacks at a Pax, you know, you just jacket not in the front Yeah, but I feel like I mean the rosy palm is a very important technique.

393
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:01,223
Scott: It also a jacket in the shower where you're washing your hand and jacket.

394
00:23:01,264 --> 00:23:01,846
Scott: It's simultaneous.

395
00:23:01,866 --> 00:23:02,610
Rym: Oh, yeah, that could work.

396
00:23:04,072 --> 00:23:10,399
Rym: I really know anywhere else that packs the jacket beside you not jacket in the shower If you are rooming with other people at packs.

397
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,363
Scott: Well, it depends.

398
00:23:11,383 --> 00:23:12,869
Rym: Yeah, I have.

399
00:23:12,889 --> 00:23:16,338
Rym: I Have not jacked it in a shower.

400
00:23:16,659 --> 00:23:18,326
Rym: We're like we've been at a con together.

401
00:23:18,526 --> 00:23:19,169
Scott: No, I haven't either.

402
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,678
Rym: Okay I was worried there was an implication what you just said.

403
00:23:21,698 --> 00:23:23,304
Rym: No, I'm just saying it's not making sure.

404
00:23:23,324 --> 00:23:26,789
Scott: I'm just saying like You know, all right, they're in the shower.

405
00:23:27,813 --> 00:23:30,353
Scott: They're in there for a few extra minutes You don't?

406
00:23:30,674 --> 00:23:37,017
Scott: they wash it away what's you know, I just if someone did I wouldn't be like upset unless they did it in a You know improper fashion.

407
00:23:37,539 --> 00:23:38,765
Rym: They leave some issue the killer.

408
00:23:38,865 --> 00:23:43,677
Scott: if there's any leftovers That's a problem, right if they take in the if they're in the shower too long That's a problem.

409
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:45,050
Rym: or if you hear it, right?

410
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:48,529
Scott: That would also be at least it would just be like come on, man.

411
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:55,036
Scott: I wouldn't like disturb me personally, but I would imagine it would be very Impolite to many other people.

412
00:23:55,479 --> 00:23:56,524
Scott: I would just be like, come on.

413
00:23:56,705 --> 00:24:00,422
Rym: someone in the chat just pointed out We have just done a sequel to the best episode of gig nights.

414
00:24:00,603 --> 00:24:02,210
Rym: Okay, I'd leave it to the imagination.

415
00:24:02,352 --> 00:24:03,430
Rym: You can search for that episode.

416
00:24:03,451 --> 00:24:03,784
Rym: It's about.

417
00:24:03,804 --> 00:24:13,108
Scott: I mean It's definitely more polite to be doing it in the shower when I'm saying in the expo hall or in your bed When the people are sleeping in the adjacent bed or same bed.

418
00:24:14,431 --> 00:24:15,515
Rym: Someone also did point out.

419
00:24:15,595 --> 00:24:16,498
Rym: I guess they have knowledge.

420
00:24:16,739 --> 00:24:19,188
Rym: Nintendo does have regionally specific marketing teams.

421
00:24:19,509 --> 00:24:19,870
Scott: Hey, that's true.

422
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:22,787
Rym: That's probably the main reason why Nintendo is not pulled out of anything yet.

423
00:24:22,868 --> 00:24:23,009
Rym: Yeah.

424
00:24:24,172 --> 00:24:28,616
Rym: So in some final news This is just the most wholesome thing and I love it.

425
00:24:28,857 --> 00:24:31,705
Scott: if you're not aware and everyone everybody is aware.

426
00:24:31,785 --> 00:24:34,974
Scott: Yeah, you'd be surprised You're not aware how you do.

427
00:24:35,014 --> 00:24:35,796
Scott: We're nice.

428
00:24:35,817 --> 00:24:40,992

00:24:45,271 --> 00:24:46,196
Rym: New doom was a great game.

00:24:46,578 --> 00:24:47,583
Rym: We didn't review it.

434
00:24:47,603 --> 00:24:48,267
Rym: I feel like we should.

435
00:24:48,387 --> 00:24:48,729
Rym: I beat it.

436
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:50,977
Rym: Yeah, there's a VR version that I tried.

437
00:24:51,018 --> 00:24:52,081
Rym: that's actually real good.

438
00:24:52,101 --> 00:24:53,828
Scott: It's just the same game though with it's real.

439
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:59,484
Rym: It's real intense in VR like Almost too intense.

440
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:02,055
Rym: Okay Also really gross.

00:25:02,657 --> 00:25:03,840
Scott: I mean it's gross my what?

442
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:19,175
Rym: Yeah, you see you think it's gross when you're doing it on a screen But when you're like in the viscera anyway, like even I was like, whoa okay, so The fandoms of these two games overlap more than you might expect Or not at all.

443
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:20,903
Rym: I think they do overlap.

444
00:25:20,963 --> 00:25:27,865
Rym: I know some people who like both these games And there is a lot of fan art and discussion between these two communities.

445
00:25:28,246 --> 00:25:29,770
Rym: that is just delightful.

446
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:29,891
Rym: Well, I

00:25:36,594 --> 00:25:38,221
Scott: person you saw wasn't the first one that was now but

450
00:25:38,241 --> 00:25:42,902
Rym: the first one I saw was the one that was Isabel sitting on doom guy's shoulder and

451
00:25:43,003 --> 00:25:44,008
Scott: also the first one I saw

452
00:25:44,089 --> 00:25:46,908
Rym: yep And it was just like rip and tear until it's done,

453
00:25:46,948 --> 00:25:47,210
Scott: right?

454
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:56,428
Scott: So someone made you know a meme crossing him over and I guess you know All the creative people in the universe on the internet were like, oh that's great.

455
00:25:56,488 --> 00:26:02,070
Scott: and they started You know riffing on that theme and they just keep on riffing cuz it's a really great mix and it doesn't get old.

456
00:26:02,472 --> 00:26:03,863
Scott: Do great taste it tastes great together.

457
00:26:03,883 --> 00:26:10,470
Scott: I Stop now wait and you know and keep going till it's spent because you're not gonna be able to redo this one.

458
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:22,250
Scott: It's not like Animal Crossing for the next Nintendo console and the next doom are also gonna release on the same day Unless you know, they're so intelligent that they do that on purpose in like three or four years from now whenever.

459
00:26:22,913 --> 00:26:24,801
Scott: But you know, it could be a much longer time than that.

460
00:26:24,881 --> 00:26:26,990
Scott: because how long since the last Animal Crossing?

461
00:26:27,851 --> 00:26:32,807
Rym: Yeah, because I like everything about Animal Crossing except I don't actually like playing the games like.

462
00:26:32,828 --> 00:26:34,375
Rym: I like the aesthetic I like the music.

463
00:26:34,637 --> 00:26:35,341
Rym: I like the fandom.

464
00:26:35,401 --> 00:26:36,830
Rym: I just don't actually enjoy the game.

465
00:26:36,911 --> 00:26:39,450
Scott: I've seen a lot of Animal Crossing and know a lot of Animal Crossing.

466
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:45,178
Rym: I've actually never actually played or bought and We could both play the new one and review it.

467
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:47,506
Scott: it's a lot of money though, I feel that's the main reason.

468
00:26:47,546 --> 00:26:47,666
Rym: Yeah.

469
00:26:47,686 --> 00:27:05,334
Rym: Yeah anyway it's time for things of the day, so I Have to hate a man by the name of Alexander Ovechkin.

470
00:27:05,354 --> 00:27:07,080
Scott: Yeah, there's a lot of reasons to hate that guy.

471
00:27:07,283 --> 00:27:15,989
Scott: He is on the enemy team yeah, but I also have to deeply respect several enemy teams as Literally I can think of at least three teams.

472
00:27:16,029 --> 00:27:16,451
Scott: He's on.

473
00:27:16,511 --> 00:27:18,397
Rym: you'll see that my thing of the day will cover that.

474
00:27:18,417 --> 00:27:23,650
Rym: he is also One of the best hockey players in history.

475
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:24,332
Scott: That's true.

476
00:27:24,513 --> 00:27:26,500
Rym: Like one man is the man is a legend.

477
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,630
Rym: He's not number one, but he is a legend.

478
00:27:29,671 --> 00:27:32,440
Rym: He will go down in history and his career ain't even done yet.

479
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,010
Rym: No, like the man is just a hockey god.

480
00:27:35,472 --> 00:27:37,500
Rym: So he recently set a record.

481
00:27:38,142 --> 00:27:40,912
Rym: He has scored 700 goals in his career.

482
00:27:40,952 --> 00:27:41,955
Scott: that's a lot of goals.

483
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:43,320
Scott: that is a lot memory.

484
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:48,040
Rym: It's hockey a sport where games will end like zero zero and go into overtime.

485
00:27:48,623 --> 00:27:51,159
Scott: Lately scoring, you know scores being up and down over time.

486
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:54,326
Scott: But yes, you know You don't score a lot of goals in a game per team.

487
00:27:54,346 --> 00:27:59,720
Scott: if you're an individual hockey player most games your score zero goals.

488
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:04,680
Scott: Yeah Maybe you get an assist if you score a point a game and a point is an assist or a goal.

489
00:28:05,222 --> 00:28:07,429
Scott: If you score a point a game that's already amazing.

490
00:28:07,509 --> 00:28:09,396
Scott: that is considered fantastic.

491
00:28:09,416 --> 00:28:10,540
Scott: You're a star player.

492
00:28:10,761 --> 00:28:13,132
Scott: Yep, right and that's not even a goal a game.

493
00:28:13,172 --> 00:28:14,277
Scott: if you score a goal a game.

494
00:28:14,297 --> 00:28:14,820
Scott: You're a legend.

495
00:28:15,061 --> 00:28:19,920
Scott: Yeah, and even if you scored a goal a game you would get 80 something goals a year.

496
00:28:20,181 --> 00:28:22,409
Scott: There's a reason to get to 700 goals.

497
00:28:22,429 --> 00:28:27,407
Scott: There's a reason half a score a goal a game For like almost 10 years.

498
00:28:27,487 --> 00:28:28,069
Rym: There's a reason.

499
00:28:28,109 --> 00:28:29,112
Rym: the hat trick exists.

500
00:28:29,152 --> 00:28:39,387
Rym: people will throw their $40 hat away If someone scores three goals in a single game because it's so crazy when it happens, yeah So this video is like two goals.

501
00:28:39,407 --> 00:28:40,672
Scott: It's like whoa, that's crazy.

502
00:28:40,712 --> 00:28:59,278
Rym: Yeah, but three in one game Was put out a couple days ago by the NHL's an official video and it is just a super cut of Every single Ovechkin goal like just the goal with like very little contacts and it is almost 13 minutes long.

503
00:28:59,298 --> 00:29:04,792
Rym: Yep, it's Mesmerizing especially because 90% of them are him in the same spot.

504
00:29:04,953 --> 00:29:06,980
Rym: Oh, I was about to say it's him in his office.

505
00:29:07,221 --> 00:29:08,125
Rym: I want to make a super cut.

506
00:29:08,386 --> 00:29:10,173
Rym: that just is him from the office.

507
00:29:10,193 --> 00:29:11,800
Scott: You just want to remove all the non office goals?

508
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:12,970
Rym: Yeah, yeah, he.

509
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:15,809
Scott: basically it's like People don't know enough about hockey.

510
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:16,372
Scott: Basically.

511
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:17,740
Scott: This is one spot.

512
00:29:17,901 --> 00:29:22,220
Scott: I'm like the circle where Ovechkin always stands and whenever I've seen him play live you see him.

513
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:27,120
Scott: He just sort of skates around there and sometimes your team is smart and has a defenseman just hanging near him.

514
00:29:27,541 --> 00:29:31,614
Rym: Sometimes his sole job is to keep him from scoring a goal like just sometimes.

515
00:29:31,654 --> 00:29:33,600
Scott: your team is stupid and he stands there all alone.

516
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:42,554
Scott: He just stands there waiting for his teammate to pass him the puck and assume when the pucks coming towards him He just takes a one-timer right at the goal and he's just practiced it so much.

517
00:29:42,754 --> 00:29:47,700
Scott: I clicked on a raise in a lot of the time Even though the goalie knows it's coming from there the goal.

518
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,839
Scott: He's got to pay attention to where the puck is, you know, not to where Ovechkin is.

519
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:51,522
Rym: No, he's not.

520
00:29:51,542 --> 00:29:53,148
Rym: I watched like a Rangers game.

521
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,658
Rym: Let's say and it's just like he's there.

522
00:29:55,798 --> 00:29:57,626
Rym: He's there He's standing in the spot.

523
00:29:57,686 --> 00:29:58,188
Scott: Don't let him.

524
00:29:58,289 --> 00:30:00,800
Scott: don't let anyone pass the puck to him when he's standing in the spot.

525
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,694
Scott: Stand in between him and the goal when he's in the spot.

526
00:30:03,715 --> 00:30:04,399
Scott: How hard is this?

527
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,690
Scott: I can see it from here and I'm not even professional.

528
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:08,539
Scott: you're paid millions of dollars a year to do this.

529
00:30:08,721 --> 00:30:10,394
Rym: That's one guy you got to worry about.

530
00:30:10,415 --> 00:30:11,000
Rym: What's wrong with you?

531
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,748
Rym: Ah, the latest comment on the video he scored on the Atlanta Thrashers.

532
00:30:13,769 --> 00:30:14,110
Rym: so much.

533
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:15,113
Rym: They became extinct.

534
00:30:15,434 --> 00:30:15,575
Scott: Yep.

535
00:30:15,976 --> 00:30:16,357
Scott: That's true.

536
00:30:16,658 --> 00:30:18,866
Rym: Yeah So what do you got?

537
00:30:18,886 --> 00:30:19,348
Scott: What do I have?

538
00:30:19,408 --> 00:30:27,556
Scott: So quite a long time ago many years ago we did When I was a kid, I had a toy called marble works Which is a bunch of plastic pieces you would put together.

539
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:28,582
Scott: and oh, yeah I had that.

540
00:30:28,742 --> 00:30:33,440
Scott: you drop marbles on the top and they would run race to the bottom right through a series of things.

541
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:37,918
Scott: It's a very similar hobby that is related to like setting up dominoes and watching them fall.

542
00:30:38,059 --> 00:30:40,913
Rym: Yep so here's also into dominoes weird.

543
00:30:40,953 --> 00:30:54,500
Scott: and then we did a. We did a thing of the day quite a long time ago about this marble Olympics, which someone made these YouTube videos of marbles, you know Competing with each other as if the marbles were people, right?

544
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:00,840
Rym: What was fascinating about that video was that it was almost as exciting as real sports like on this particular wavelength, right?

545
00:31:02,021 --> 00:31:06,354
Scott: So here is a video sponsored by a company that sells bulk dominoes.

546
00:31:06,374 --> 00:31:08,420
Scott: Yeah, that is a marbula one.

547
00:31:09,302 --> 00:31:21,692
Scott: It is brand new and they basically did extremely high production values of marbles racing around this Grand Prix track You know playing it totally straight as if it's a real race a real sport.

548
00:31:21,732 --> 00:31:23,276
Scott: the marbles are on real teams.

549
00:31:23,657 --> 00:31:24,640
Scott: they have real names.

550
00:31:25,403 --> 00:31:29,640
Scott: They're actually competing, you know, it's somewhat thrilling like a real sport.

551
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:37,035
Scott: But really this is thing of the day because the production value Yeah, so insanely high if you're willing to put like just to play this straight.

552
00:31:37,056 --> 00:31:38,320
Rym: That is amazing.

553
00:31:39,603 --> 00:31:47,523
Scott: They even put like marbles in the grandstand And they called the whole thing as if it was real Competating.

554
00:31:47,563 --> 00:31:50,956
Scott: and it's it's something to see props to whoever put this together.

555
00:31:51,237 --> 00:31:53,964
Rym: I wonder how many All your camera flipped over.

556
00:31:53,984 --> 00:32:00,160
Rym: I wonder how many takes it took for them to not crack up doing the commentary on these marbles.

557
00:32:00,301 --> 00:32:01,473
Scott: It's just one person doing it.

558
00:32:01,514 --> 00:32:04,654
Rym: Yeah So in that a moment, we're gonna be at PAX.

Rym: Okay, there's a really good fist.

590
00:33:44,328 --> 00:33:45,934

594
00:33:57,043 --> 00:34:02,174
Rym: That is literally in my top five favorite statues of all time, it's not bad It's just a giant statue of his fist.

00:34:02,215 --> 00:34:02,678
Rym: Nothing else.

600
00:34:19,886 --> 00:34:24,619
Rym: We have reviewed a lot of board games on GeekNights in the last 15 years.

601
00:34:25,341 --> 00:34:29,292
Rym: Oh, yeah, and I have been taking and I've been doing this for a while.

602
00:34:29,351 --> 00:34:31,639
Rym: So there's 65 of them on YouTube.

603
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:37,945
Rym: now I've been taking just the reviews without like the opening crap Yeah thing of the day.

604
00:34:38,005 --> 00:34:38,407
Scott: that's the thing.

605
00:34:38,447 --> 00:34:54,719
Scott: the format of GeekNights, which may change at any time but the format as it has been for a zillion years is do a bunch of bullshit first like the bullshit we're doing right now and Then actually talk about the fucking topic Just like when you watch a late show on TV and it's like yeah a bunch of bullshit at the start of the show and then They interview the celebrity at the end.

606
00:34:54,820 --> 00:35:00,960
Rym: But if you're reading a recipe you don't want like my year in Sardinia before they tell you how to make some food.

607
00:35:01,241 --> 00:35:02,043
Scott: Right, exactly.

608
00:35:02,084 --> 00:35:06,799
Scott: So if you want to hear just the main bit where we talk about the board game, they're on YouTube.

609
00:35:06,919 --> 00:35:08,465
Rym: Yep 65 of them.

610
00:35:08,505 --> 00:35:13,060
Rym: there's a playlist of all of them and I'm adding like regularly that I'm going through the back catalogue.

611
00:35:13,541 --> 00:35:19,076
Rym: Eventually every board game we've ever reviewed will be here as a standalone review with like images and everything.

612
00:35:19,116 --> 00:35:19,698
Rym: It's a whole thing.

613
00:35:19,718 --> 00:35:25,206
Scott: Mm-hmm Yeah The book club book is book.

614
00:35:25,246 --> 00:35:26,852
Rym: club book is tail of Genji.

615
00:35:26,872 --> 00:35:30,003
Scott: Yeah, I'm still reading it on the subway slowly It's long.

616
00:35:30,024 --> 00:35:31,308
Scott: Yeah, I'll read it.

617
00:35:32,031 --> 00:35:38,230
Scott: I'm enjoying I'll read some on my way to Pax and I think I continue to be more interested in everyone.

618
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:38,812
Rym: but Genji.

619
00:35:39,112 --> 00:35:39,273
Scott: Yep.

620
00:35:39,694 --> 00:35:41,860
Rym: It's definitely a Genji muyo situation.

621
00:35:43,781 --> 00:35:52,116
Scott: That's the first novel that has ever been written now not the first fiction for his now first novel Yep, so I figured that makes it important to read.

622
00:35:52,156 --> 00:35:52,640
Scott: So we're reading it.

623
00:35:52,700 --> 00:36:03,617
Rym: Yeah Before we get into the main bid because a friend of ours who was also very much into the randomizers pointed out something interesting And important send your friend to the panel so you can play a quick game without them at PAX.

624
00:36:03,778 --> 00:36:05,188
Scott: Oh the slow person Okay.

625
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:22,660
Rym: Yeah, so Randomizers have been a thing and I feel like there are only two like People either like know the deal or have never heard of this or you know The other the people who like have heard of it, but like they didn't actually like for me.

626
00:36:22,821 --> 00:36:31,097
Scott: I knew about it way long ago Right, but not until the past few months that I actually look closer and was like

627
00:36:33,861 --> 00:36:35,889
Rym: Well, cuz I think I feel like the progression

628
00:36:35,929 --> 00:36:40,350
Scott: is you know, you sort of understand it like, okay, I get what's going on there All right, whatever.

629
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:41,680
Scott: Yeah, I get the idea but

630
00:36:41,701 --> 00:36:51,185
Rym: then eventually like someone says like something like a different format and they're like Oh wonder how they do those formats and then you kind of want to play one and then you're dragged in and you figure it Right,

631
00:36:51,648 --> 00:36:53,540
Scott: so basically the deal is right.

632
00:36:53,763 --> 00:36:59,654
Scott: There are a lot of video games out there Especially these days that are procedurally generated or randomized in some way even board games.

633
00:36:59,815 --> 00:37:01,380
Scott: Yeah, right you start with a random map.

634
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,244
Scott: Why do we do this?

635
00:37:02,605 --> 00:37:05,860
Scott: because we don't want to randomize the game, right?

636
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:18,772
Scott: So that one player has an advantage or disadvantage because of luck but we want to use luck and randomness in our games to get a different experience each time you play so we don't get bored and Play the exact same thing every time even if the spire

637
00:37:18,892 --> 00:37:20,660
Rym: is great because I don't know what's coming.

638
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:28,644
Scott: Roguelikes are pretty much the first games to to capitalize on this idea, you know hardcore wise but you know Minecraft does it.

639
00:37:28,885 --> 00:37:29,949
Scott: even Puerto Rico does it.

640
00:37:30,029 --> 00:37:32,820
Scott: the plantations are different every time just a little bit, right?

641
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:41,560
Scott: So with the idea of a randomizer is like, okay We got all these new games we've made that are random and have tons of replay value.

642
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:46,382
Scott: But what if you know these games aren't the best games there ever were right?

643
00:37:46,402 --> 00:37:55,800
Scott: the best games there ever were are games like Super Metroid or link to the fast or Mario's got about it.

644
00:37:55,860 --> 00:38:02,100
Rym: I just say more that there's a lot of reasons why this particular era of games is most suited to this randomizer thing.

645
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,143
Scott: Oh, that's also true.

646
00:38:03,304 --> 00:38:08,700
Scott: The best games that ever were also happen to be extremely suited to being randomized.

647
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:09,544
Rym: But it's partly that now.

648
00:38:09,605 --> 00:38:23,560
Rym: recently we've seen something like there was the remake of link to the past not link to the past of links awakenings that people can play this game, but There aren't that many good Zelda games for example, like you can have played them all and memorize them all and then just fuck you.

649
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:26,940
Rym: There aren't more of these games to play and the indie ones tend to not be that good.

650
00:38:27,061 --> 00:38:36,900
Rym: So now you're just sort of playing the same game over and over again slowly going crazy Especially the single-player games right where your inner you're exploring an environment, especially something like that.

651
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:40,078
Scott: It's like they become the first time you play the game, right?

652
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,845
Scott: You know, I always say how.

653
00:38:42,087 --> 00:38:44,820
Scott: there's no spoilers or bullshit for movies, right?

654
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:49,560
Scott: But spoilers are not bullshit for a game like Zelda or Super Metroid or something, right?

655
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:54,360
Scott: Because the first time you play assuming you haven't like read a map or spoiled it, right?

656
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,740
Scott: You're exploring and learning and discovering and solving puzzles, right?

657
00:38:59,181 --> 00:39:05,140
Scott: If you have a crossword puzzle, right the first time you do it You're looking at the clues and you're trying to figure out their meaning.

658
00:39:05,522 --> 00:39:09,540
Scott: The second time you do it you just remember that word was in that spot.

659
00:39:09,701 --> 00:39:12,260
Scott: It is now a completely fundamentally a different activity.

660
00:39:12,621 --> 00:39:17,580
Scott: It becomes a knowledge based activity and not a you know, trivia based activity.

661
00:39:17,741 --> 00:39:21,440
Scott: You're using a completely different part of your brain in a completely different part way.

662
00:39:21,801 --> 00:39:29,608
Scott: The second or third time you do something it becomes all about knowledge and not about skills as much Or about anything else.

663
00:39:29,669 --> 00:39:31,700
Rym: so but what you get out of it is different too.

664
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:39,258
Rym: Like you might be like you want to play a Final Fantasy 1 again But you don't want to just play Final Fantasy 1 again, but you want that feeling of playing Final Fantasy 1, right?

665
00:39:40,161 --> 00:39:43,960
Scott: So if you play Final Fantasy 1 again, it's like well, it doesn't change on you.

666
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,427
Scott: But huh, let's randomize it.

667
00:39:45,728 --> 00:39:46,613
Scott: different bad guys.

668
00:39:46,733 --> 00:39:48,020
Scott: items are in different places.

669
00:39:48,381 --> 00:39:50,988
Scott: People say different things different towns different.

670
00:39:51,009 --> 00:39:53,817
Scott: right you can because these are such simple pieces of software.

671
00:39:53,857 --> 00:39:54,940
Scott: We can emulate all of them.

672
00:39:55,401 --> 00:40:04,657
Scott: It's really easy to take a piece right to go and look into that ROM and figure out which pieces Of memory represent what and shuffle them around.

673
00:40:04,677 --> 00:40:08,690
Rym: Yep but I think there's a lot more going on here in terms of like.

674
00:40:08,831 --> 00:40:10,596
Rym: why it became such a big thing?

675
00:40:10,656 --> 00:40:14,920
Rym: because it's not just Play a randomized version of Zelda like most people are into this community.

676
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:19,292
Rym: It's overlapped with speedrunners and competitive gaming.

677
00:40:19,473 --> 00:40:21,340
Rym: Oh, yeah people want it to be a competition.

678
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,058
Rym: I'll erase it.

679
00:40:22,241 --> 00:40:28,793
Rym: I think it came out of a lot of this the like Link to the past and Final Fantasy like races that would happen like speedrunners racing.

680
00:40:28,953 --> 00:40:33,460
Scott: speed running is definitely the added the Competitive element to the randomizers, right?

681
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,867
Scott: So the randomizers themselves are great for that.

682
00:40:36,369 --> 00:40:39,920
Scott: replay value and eliminating knowledge games sort of thing.

683
00:40:40,201 --> 00:40:44,140
Scott: Yeah, right, but competitive wise it's like, okay people were speed running.

684
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:47,220
Scott: We're already speed running a game like Zelda Super Metroid, right?

685
00:40:47,561 --> 00:40:48,446
Scott: But it's the same damn game.

686
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:51,705
Scott: every time they find ways to make it faster But you're still.

687
00:40:52,228 --> 00:40:54,960
Scott: it's all about improving your execution, right?

688
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,100
Scott: They're all working together to share the knowledge of how to do it the fastest.

689
00:40:58,742 --> 00:41:03,540
Scott: It's all about who can actually push the buttons the most precisely right all in one go.

690
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:06,340
Rym: Yep, so these things end up being like serious players.

691
00:41:06,481 --> 00:41:10,520
Rym: It's all about like can you do the frame perfect tricks you need to do and independently?

692
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:15,996
Rym: Do you know the game well enough to know all the locations and the kinds of things you might need?

693
00:41:16,377 --> 00:41:17,280
Rym: and then you compete in?

694
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,511
Rym: This kind of random e world with all these other people.

695
00:41:20,572 --> 00:41:25,160
Scott: by bringing the randomizer into the speedrun You're still testing the execution, right?

696
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:28,139
Scott: Because when like you have to fight a boss, well, you have to be good at fighting that boss.

697
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,780
Rym: But now there's a. there's a bigger risk.

698
00:41:30,781 --> 00:41:34,359
Rym: Beat Ganon right and press your luck like in free enterprise the Final Fantasy 4 one.

699
00:41:35,022 --> 00:41:35,343
Rym: It's like.

700
00:41:35,544 --> 00:41:37,231
Rym: does someone go to the moon early and risk it?

701
00:41:37,252 --> 00:41:39,140
Rym: like what if the enemy needs up there and strike to the room?

702
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:39,421
Scott: Isn't?

703
00:41:39,461 --> 00:41:40,005
Scott: it's awesome?

704
00:41:40,046 --> 00:41:41,739
Scott: because you don't know where anything is.

705
00:41:42,141 --> 00:41:53,260
Scott: You actually have to think and make different decisions and now Decision making and not just execution come into play and you can test the broader set of skills.

706
00:41:53,681 --> 00:41:56,633
Scott: Right, some of your knowledge is still tested right?

707
00:41:56,753 --> 00:41:58,440
Scott: just it's just not purely knowledge.

708
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,271
Scott: Yeah, it's like you still need to know.

709
00:42:00,332 --> 00:42:04,109
Scott: like aha with this item I can go to these places right versus.

710
00:42:04,571 --> 00:42:06,880
Scott: this is the exact memorize the exact path.

711
00:42:07,129 --> 00:42:13,380
Scott: Yeah Remember it's almost like there's a maze that's been shuffled and you just and it's not a straight maze of go from beginning to end.

712
00:42:14,022 --> 00:42:17,895
Scott: You know, all right, you got you can enter the maze, but you can't get to the end.

713
00:42:18,016 --> 00:42:19,160
Scott: It's locked, you know.

714
00:42:19,442 --> 00:42:21,477
Scott: It's basically the equivalent game to Wolfenstein 3d.

715
00:42:22,101 --> 00:42:25,240
Scott: We have to get keys to open doors to get keys to open doors to get to the exit.

716
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,425
Scott: It's the same exact game as that.

717
00:42:26,666 --> 00:42:28,715
Rym: So imagine you're doing a Wolfenstein race, right?

718
00:42:28,756 --> 00:42:31,008
Scott: It's a Wolfenstein race but it's a brand new map.

719
00:42:31,028 --> 00:42:41,683
Scott: you've never seen before every single time and You know that like aha if I get a yellow key Then that means that I can open door I can go east right and if I get a blue key I can go west.

720
00:42:42,144 --> 00:42:45,173
Scott: but it's still not a hundred percent the same every time.

721
00:42:45,213 --> 00:42:47,259
Scott: so there's some knowledge plays into it.

722
00:42:47,802 --> 00:42:50,540
Scott: Some of your execution skills still play into it.

723
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:55,020
Scott: It's all fighting the same bosses the same enemies, but the enemies might be different places.

724
00:42:55,381 --> 00:43:01,300
Scott: They might you know different wet but some of your skills still matter But everything else is shuffled up.

725
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:03,208
Scott: so you're getting a brand new experience every time.

726
00:43:03,268 --> 00:43:17,060
Scott: you still feel it feels way more fun to do and you test all those things as well as the additional test of Figuring out the optimal, you know figure out on the fly the optimal path instead of having a memorized optimal path.

727
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:29,152
Rym: And it is definitely like a little bit performative in the sense that like like Final Fantasy 4 like the the randomizer I like the most is the Final Fantasy 4 one Partly because Final Fantasy 4 is a game that I know inside and out.

728
00:43:29,633 --> 00:43:30,556
Rym: So it's a it.

729
00:43:30,596 --> 00:43:36,360
Rym: lets me apply this Completely useless knowledge from my childhood into a current hobby.

730
00:43:36,632 --> 00:43:47,620
Rym: Yep but like what that does mean is that it's really hard to enjoy a Game like to an obsessive childhood degree.

731
00:43:48,106 --> 00:43:49,180
Rym: I don't know about that.

732
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:51,712
Scott: It depends right on the the exact game.

733
00:43:51,732 --> 00:43:55,687
Rym: and like I would not play the link to the past Randomizers of any kind until you had beaten.

734
00:43:55,727 --> 00:43:58,276
Rym: link to the past at least twice like all the way through.

735
00:43:58,316 --> 00:44:02,640
Scott: you should definitely beat it Not with the normal mode, but I'll play a randomizer.

736
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:07,660
Scott: But I think even if you've never played it you can still watch and enjoy the red.

737
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:12,236
Rym: Oh, you can definitely watch and enjoy but it's playing would be too too difficult.

738
00:44:12,277 --> 00:44:13,140
Scott: You lose a few head.

739
00:44:13,261 --> 00:44:14,379
Scott: They do have easy modes.

740
00:44:15,941 --> 00:44:21,157
Scott: Like a lot of the randomizers when you randomize there's all sorts of choices of what exactly you're randomizing and how

741
00:44:21,197 --> 00:44:23,684
Rym: much there's like website Generators you can use

742
00:44:23,704 --> 00:44:27,744
Scott: and the links of the past was the one that gets mentioned the most because it's the one that's been developed The most thoroughly.

743
00:44:27,784 --> 00:44:30,057
Scott: they're on version like 32 or something, right?

744
00:44:30,097 --> 00:44:30,539
Scott: They've been out.

745
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,724
Scott: They've been honing that.

746
00:44:31,744 --> 00:44:34,293
Scott: that's the sharpest knife of all the randomizer knives.

747
00:44:34,333 --> 00:44:40,580
Scott: Final Fantasy 4 is pretty tight Yeah, and there are just so many options, but they do have like easy modes, right?

748
00:44:40,641 --> 00:44:42,820
Scott: So for example the Super Metroid one, right?

749
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:45,568
Scott: There's a glitch in Super Metroid called the the mock ball.

750
00:44:45,608 --> 00:44:55,780
Scott: that lets you get under these gates and go to I think into Brinstar without Like without having to fight the the plant boss out of the spore spawn whatever.

751
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,356
Rym: Oh, yeah, cuz you never see anyone fight that in a speed run.

752
00:44:58,376 --> 00:44:59,020
Scott: You watch a speed run.

753
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:01,454
Scott: No one ever fights the spore spawn because they do the mock ball, right?

754
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:02,500
Scott: I've tried to do the mock ball.

755
00:45:02,641 --> 00:45:03,105
Scott: I can't do it.

756
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:04,680
Scott: It's too hard because I'm not I'm an old man.

757
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:17,980
Scott: Right, but you can when you're making a metro a Super Metroid randomized ROM you can choose Say, okay put the items when you're randomizing them make sure that you don't put an item.

758
00:45:18,723 --> 00:45:23,280
Scott: You know in such a way that means I can't complete the game without doing mock ball.

759
00:45:23,501 --> 00:45:27,920
Scott: Yep, or you can say actually, you know what put the items, you know, I can do mock ball.

760
00:45:28,001 --> 00:45:30,560
Scott: You put the items wherever you feel like I'm gonna get there.

761
00:45:31,225 --> 00:45:33,682
Scott: And it's the same thing for all the other randomizers I've seen.

762
00:45:34,083 --> 00:45:41,587
Scott: they let you customize how random it's gonna be and that actually plays into How you play the randomizer because you go.

763
00:45:41,647 --> 00:45:46,120
Scott: All right, I just got you know, I haven't gotten a super missile yet.

764
00:45:46,341 --> 00:45:47,044
Scott: Yeah, right.

765
00:45:47,386 --> 00:45:50,020
Scott: This these places are unreachable by super missile.

766
00:45:50,120 --> 00:46:06,660
Scott: Therefore there must be a super missile in one of these five places because those are the only five places I haven't checked right that are Accessible right now with the items I have We're where is with what route do I take to check those places most efficiently?

767
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:10,900
Scott: Right, and that's where the skill of randomizer comes in.

768
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:16,517
Rym: Yep, and I think like my progression was I saw them like on speedrunners channels first.

769
00:46:16,777 --> 00:46:17,660
Rym: Yeah, I saw speed run.

770
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:18,920
Scott: That's where I see them the most.

771
00:46:19,027 --> 00:46:28,030
Rym: Yeah And I was like interested partly because like as much as I love RPG speedruns I've seen like the world record runs of all these games.

772
00:46:28,512 --> 00:46:29,455
Rym: So there's not.

773
00:46:29,936 --> 00:46:30,919
Rym: they're all the same now.

774
00:46:31,228 --> 00:46:38,418
Rym: Yep unless it's like an AGT queue or like there's good commentary and a couch and all that but like I've seen these games to the Point that I don't need to watch them again.

775
00:46:38,861 --> 00:46:51,561
Rym: so I started watching the free enterprise Final Fantasy 4 ones because it just gave me this like kind of Exciting speedrun or race that I can't get like watching a Final Fantasy 4 race straight is not that fun Cuz.

776
00:46:51,721 --> 00:46:56,639
Rym: either they're neck-and-neck the whole time or one person falls behind and it's over right even formula one.

777
00:46:56,859 --> 00:46:59,120
Scott: funny That my thing of the day was marbula one, right?

778
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,240
Scott: They have the same mostly the same tracks every year, right?

779
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:07,357
Scott: And even though they change tracks race to race which keeps it interesting and varied, right?

780
00:47:07,477 --> 00:47:08,320
Scott: It's still year to year.

781
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,405
Scott: It's kind of all right.

782
00:47:09,605 --> 00:47:12,819
Scott: Yeah, we're back at Monaco again, which is still a great track, but whatever right?

783
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:30,403
Scott: imagine if formula one literally they show up at the track in a car and An unknown track appears before them like they're driving there even know what the next turn is left or right or how close it Is or if it's a hairpin or anything, they're gonna drive around the track mad slow Right and learn

784
00:47:30,423 --> 00:47:30,905
Rym: track

785
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:33,673
Scott: and then speed up and then you have like a real.

786
00:47:34,034 --> 00:47:36,280
Scott: the competition is now not just who?

787
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:42,771
Scott: Fine-tuned their car for that track knowing everything going in and had the best practice and is the best of that track.

788
00:47:42,891 --> 00:47:50,490
Scott: It's Fastest driver when it comes to tracks everyone already knows.

789
00:47:50,892 --> 00:47:58,760
Scott: but if you had to learn a track straight up Maybe there's someone else who learns faster and they would be better or just has more raw racing skills, right?

790
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,460
Scott: Or there's also a luck factor though.

791
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:09,209
Scott: Maybe someone's really good at high speed tracks that right and they're good when they're like a long straightaway and it randomly happens to be a track that suits their style.

792
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:20,276
Rym: or maybe someone's falling behind because one thing that the all these randomizers have that makes the races so much fun and why I'm actually into them is You can press your luck in a way that you can't do in a normal speed run race.

793
00:48:20,316 --> 00:48:22,228
Rym: if you're falling behind Take a risk.

794
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:23,860
Scott: Yep, take a big risk.

795
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:24,944
Scott: Well, it's like you watching.

796
00:48:24,984 --> 00:48:29,480
Scott: it is sort of like gives the the spectator the feeling of scratching a bunch of lottery tickets.

797
00:48:29,641 --> 00:48:31,371
Scott: Oh, right every time they open a chest.

798
00:48:31,431 --> 00:48:32,980
Scott: It's like who is it gonna be?

799
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:35,392
Scott: It could just be some garbage or like be the best.

800
00:48:35,513 --> 00:48:36,840
Rym: I get back to your race analogy.

801
00:48:37,323 --> 00:48:40,440
Rym: I'm fine Sam way behind in the f1 like randomizer track.

802
00:48:40,921 --> 00:48:47,200
Rym: Maybe I just accelerate hard into a corner and just hope that there isn't a chicane right on the other side.

803
00:48:47,421 --> 00:48:48,885
Rym: Yep, like I'll go for it.

804
00:48:48,905 --> 00:48:49,286
Rym: I'm behind.

805
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:53,659
Rym: Anyway, worst case I explode and die, but if it's a straightaway, I might catch up.

806
00:48:54,041 --> 00:48:54,282
Scott: Yep.

807
00:48:54,644 --> 00:48:54,866
Scott: Yep.

808
00:48:54,906 --> 00:48:55,087
Scott: Yep.

809
00:48:55,872 --> 00:49:03,640
Scott: So some of these Randomizer things out there have really pushed the limits of what they're randomizing.

810
00:49:04,021 --> 00:49:08,580
Scott: Yeah, sometimes to good extent but sometimes to questionable extent, right?

811
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:12,000
Scott: So for example, there's a lot of multi-world things going on, right?

812
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:15,799
Scott: So the there's two different kinds of multi-world cross games.

813
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:18,667
Scott: Yeah So one of them is is this thing?

814
00:49:18,687 --> 00:49:26,549
Scott: it just so happens apparently by luck that the two biggest randomizer games Super Metroid and link to the past right.

815
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:35,406
Scott: for some reason one of them takes up one half of the super Nintendo cartridge and the other one take us the other half I. They're both the same chips in the cartridge Just memory wise.

816
00:49:35,627 --> 00:49:40,224
Scott: one is on one half ones on the other so you could put both games in the same cartridge and they don't Really overlap each other.

817
00:49:40,665 --> 00:49:41,388
Scott: so they made it.

818
00:49:41,528 --> 00:49:42,291
Scott: they hacked it up.

819
00:49:43,153 --> 00:49:45,981
Scott: It's super Metroid link to the past randomizer They.

820
00:49:46,202 --> 00:49:47,407
Scott: this useless feels.

821
00:49:47,488 --> 00:49:48,713
Rym: very chess boxing.

822
00:49:48,893 --> 00:49:49,315
Scott: Oh, yes.

823
00:49:49,396 --> 00:49:50,460
Scott: It's very chess boxing.

824
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:53,173
Scott: Not only you're playing link to the past.

825
00:49:53,193 --> 00:49:54,720
Scott: you walk into like a door.

826
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:56,048
Scott: You would never go in like the.

827
00:49:56,189 --> 00:49:58,080
Scott: I think it's like the the fortune tellers, huh?

828
00:49:59,441 --> 00:50:00,825
Scott: Useless place to go.

829
00:50:00,945 --> 00:50:05,460
Scott: and you walk in and suddenly Samus walks out a door and you're in Super Metroid.

830
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:11,300
Scott: and Then Samus goes and fights a boss and grab, you know goes there's a chozo statue.

831
00:50:11,822 --> 00:50:15,459
Scott: They shoot the ball in the chozo statue and it's like a hook shot.

832
00:50:15,972 --> 00:50:19,131
Scott: Yeah They grab the hook shot and now Samus goes in a door.

833
00:50:19,171 --> 00:50:22,924
Scott: that goes like a map room a place Samus a useless place for Samus to go right?

834
00:50:22,944 --> 00:50:23,766
Scott: You don't need a map room.

835
00:50:23,947 --> 00:50:28,080
Scott: Yeah, and suddenly link comes out in hyrule with a hook shot.

836
00:50:28,724 --> 00:50:33,164
Scott: right, and then link goes and opens the treasure chest and It's a super missile.

837
00:50:33,244 --> 00:50:34,007
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

838
00:50:34,348 --> 00:50:35,532
Scott: that's how that's crazy.

839
00:50:36,034 --> 00:50:36,295
Scott: Right?

840
00:50:36,375 --> 00:50:37,800
Scott: There's like actually very few.

841
00:50:38,021 --> 00:50:39,427
Scott: It's amazing with to watch.

842
00:50:39,728 --> 00:50:42,118
Scott: there are very few humans who can actually play it.

843
00:50:42,961 --> 00:50:44,145
Scott: Right that's thing.

844
00:50:44,385 --> 00:50:49,120
Scott: I'll have a problem in the competitive scene that there's like not enough people who can actually play this damn thing.

845
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:52,890
Scott: Yeah, right and then at least especially not to a competitive level.

846
00:50:52,930 --> 00:50:56,378
Scott: and then the other kind is they've got these multi-world things where.

847
00:50:56,659 --> 00:51:00,179
Scott: okay I'll play some link to the past and you play some link to the past.

848
00:51:00,722 --> 00:51:08,799
Scott: right and we're gonna generate ROMs together and I'll give you ROM a and I'll take ROM B and We're gonna connect our emulators to the internet.

849
00:51:09,457 --> 00:51:16,707
Scott: and When I pick up I see I see an arrow and I pick up the arrows lying on the ground and it's sometimes I might Just like oh that was your arrow.

850
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:18,500
Scott: Sometimes it was Rym's arrow.

851
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:23,274
Scott: Yeah, it's randomized it in such a way that the game is beatable, right?

852
00:51:23,294 --> 00:51:25,100
Scott: It actually logically figures out.

853
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,900
Scott: Okay, we'll put all these items in a place such that all these people can beat the game.

854
00:51:29,342 --> 00:51:32,476
Scott: There make someone was playing a hundred player randomizer.

855
00:51:32,536 --> 00:51:39,164
Scott: Whoa And like if you forfeit and quit it just takes all the items that are in your game and gives them to the people they Belong to because you quit.

856
00:51:39,767 --> 00:51:40,812
Scott: that way they can beat the games.

857
00:51:40,892 --> 00:51:44,117
Rym: What if someone who has your item just sucks They'll hopefully quit.

858
00:51:45,821 --> 00:51:48,755
Rym: So if I suck and I just keep on keeping on.

859
00:51:48,795 --> 00:51:49,940
Rym: I'm just hoarding the item.

860
00:51:50,061 --> 00:51:54,500
Scott: I might just be end up waiting for you for someone to find my stuff and I won't have any locations.

861
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:55,809
Rym: Check that's.

862
00:51:55,950 --> 00:51:57,380
Scott: somebody finds my item.

863
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:57,901
Rym: we're in.

864
00:51:57,942 --> 00:52:07,419
Rym: we're past like the early like bleeding edge of this and we're getting into like more amor of a plateau where the Randomizers that I think are the most popular and doing the best are the ones where?

865
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:16,319
Rym: Game design decisions are being made by the community and it's starting to coalesce into like the right number of people Who have the right sensibility to make these work?

866
00:52:17,161 --> 00:52:17,242
Rym: Like.

867
00:52:17,262 --> 00:52:20,536
Rym: I want to give you example of that because the link to the past randomizer and it like.

868
00:52:20,556 --> 00:52:23,960
Rym: there's a little fact here that Explains what has changed from the original game?

869
00:52:24,001 --> 00:52:25,380
Rym: I want to read some of these front for you.

870
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:31,580
Rym: Just give you a sense of like how the community has decided to alter the games just to make this work.

871
00:52:31,921 --> 00:52:33,225
Rym: So it isn't just random bullshit.

872
00:52:33,245 --> 00:52:33,867
Rym: That isn't fun.

873
00:52:33,888 --> 00:52:34,229
Rym: Yep.

874
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:37,259
Rym: You're guaranteed to get the digging game item by the 30th dig.

875
00:52:37,801 --> 00:52:41,397
Rym: Yep, you're guaranteed to get the village of outcast chest item on the first attempt.

876
00:52:41,738 --> 00:52:44,989
Rym: Mm-hmm The pyramid and waterfall wishing fairies no longer upgrade your items.

877
00:52:45,029 --> 00:52:49,204
Rym: instead the caves contain two chests each of which account for the usual Upgrades like.

878
00:52:49,585 --> 00:52:52,357
Rym: that's the kind of work people are doing to make this work.

879
00:52:52,638 --> 00:52:54,245
Scott: Mm-hmm Yeah, it's also way.

880
00:52:54,306 --> 00:52:55,150
Scott: it's all once.

881
00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:57,340
Scott: you've played the randomized versions of a lot of these games.

882
00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:02,834
Scott: Also, they cut out because that's mostly speedrunning people who have speedrunning interests making these.

883
00:53:03,275 --> 00:53:08,320
Scott: they cut out a lot of the time wasting Bullshit, so it's actually much more.

884
00:53:08,521 --> 00:53:13,780
Scott: It's it's almost like a convenient version of the game like ah fast text a very minimal text.

885
00:53:14,684 --> 00:53:16,091
Scott: I don't have to wait through cutscenes.

886
00:53:16,111 --> 00:53:17,015
Scott: They've been removed.

887
00:53:17,538 --> 00:53:18,000
Scott: This is great.

888
00:53:18,261 --> 00:53:21,218
Scott: It's like it's like a you don't really if you go back and play the original game.

889
00:53:21,238 --> 00:53:24,369
Scott: You're like Yeah, is this so inconvenient?

890
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:25,574
Rym: come on just give me the sword.

891
00:53:25,614 --> 00:53:26,096
Rym: give me the sword.

892
00:53:26,116 --> 00:53:26,920
Rym: just give me the fucking sword.

893
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:27,242
Rym: Let me go.

894
00:53:27,263 --> 00:53:28,432
Rym: Let me go right pop up.

895
00:53:28,875 --> 00:53:31,547
Scott: also, you know The thing is some of these randomized type things.

896
00:53:31,647 --> 00:53:31,788
Scott: right.

897
00:53:31,848 --> 00:53:35,220
Scott: sometimes, you know, cuz it's been randomized the game can end up way easy.

898
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:36,245
Scott: You get the dream, right?

899
00:53:36,285 --> 00:53:39,180
Scott: It's like, okay, you start playing a game and it's like guess what?

900
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,488
Scott: You got the super powerful weapon right immediately.

901
00:53:41,508 --> 00:53:44,540
Scott: The game is now gonna be way easy and fun and that's hella fun.

902
00:53:44,781 --> 00:53:58,444
Scott: No denying that but sometimes you play this and it's like alright, it's been 50 minutes I've checked a million places and I don't even have a sword yet and I have to go and fight these bad guys with bombs And I have to beat.

903
00:53:58,504 --> 00:53:59,247
Scott: there's nothing.

904
00:53:59,287 --> 00:54:02,380
Scott: there's no item left for me to get except for this boss who has an item.

905
00:54:02,882 --> 00:54:06,216
Scott: I have to fight them with my bow and arrow.

906
00:54:06,236 --> 00:54:10,400
Scott: Yeah, right There's all kinds of crazy shit like that that goes on in randomizers.

907
00:54:10,721 --> 00:54:14,860
Rym: It's got a little random feeling of like old Atari games that have a million modes.

908
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:28,820
Rym: like there's a million modes these randomizers, but honestly unless you get like Too deep like to where your predilections become increasingly esoteric I suggest you stick to the types of randomizations that the community tends to support.

909
00:54:29,604 --> 00:54:32,240
Scott: Yeah, and you you know just for the super pro ones, right?

910
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:36,820
Scott: Either level your skills way up to play the or watch the pros or just watch pros and don't bother.

911
00:54:36,926 --> 00:54:38,787
Rym: Yeah The Final Fantasy one.

912
00:54:38,807 --> 00:54:41,780
Rym: what I love the most about it is like the game design changes.

913
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,928
Rym: You can go anywhere like imagine you start with the airship.

914
00:54:44,270 --> 00:54:51,169
Rym: There's a bunch of changes, but you can fight Like when you go to where a boss would be Depending on how you randomize it.

915
00:54:51,571 --> 00:55:00,860
Rym: either any bosses there But whatever boss is there has the level equivalent of the boss that should be there.

916
00:55:01,141 --> 00:55:04,093
Scott: Yep, so you might go to the first boss in the game.

917
00:55:04,173 --> 00:55:05,860
Scott: It might be the last boss in the game.

918
00:55:05,921 --> 00:55:08,330
Scott: Yeah, they might Of the first boss.

919
00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:17,400
Rym: Yeah, you might fight a rubicante But he sucks or you might fight the miss dragon in the giant robot and it's a dangerous fucking miss dragon.

920
00:55:17,621 --> 00:55:20,170
Rym: Yep, you better actually know how to fight that miss dragon.

921
00:55:20,572 --> 00:55:22,740
Scott: Yeah, it's like in the actual regular game.

922
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:25,719
Rym: You don't really have to know you don't have to worry about like how do I deal with?

923
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:37,712
Rym: Rubicante if like we're all level one and his spells suck But I also suck like you don't have to think about that kind of situation gives you all these new Challenges right and that's the thing is like I was saying before.

924
00:55:38,234 --> 00:55:39,738
Scott: these are the greatest games there are.

925
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:46,160
Scott: it's like it would Be really hard to make a brand new game as good as any of these legendary games.

926
00:55:46,901 --> 00:55:49,579
Scott: Right, it'd basically be like and some of that's not game design.

927
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:54,142
Rym: It's more like it's a genre that doesn't make sense anymore for like modern sensibilities There's.

928
00:55:54,202 --> 00:55:57,280
Scott: I'm just saying it's like it's tough to beat the best of the best, right?

929
00:55:57,601 --> 00:55:59,900
Rym: I mean, there's a reason there's only one chrono trigger game.

930
00:56:00,081 --> 00:56:01,714
Rym: Like no one's made a game like that ever again.

931
00:56:01,755 --> 00:56:02,420
Rym: That was popular.

932
00:56:02,652 --> 00:56:07,540
Scott: No But somehow we can get more playability out of those old games.

933
00:56:08,121 --> 00:56:08,643
Scott: That can.

934
00:56:08,843 --> 00:56:12,553
Scott: that's really hard for any new game even a completely fresh one to compete with.

935
00:56:12,674 --> 00:56:19,420
Rym: people are fucking talking about Like people younger than me are talking about Final Fantasy 4 because of this like.

936
00:56:19,942 --> 00:56:23,976
Rym: That excites me as someone who is old and likes Final Fantasy 4.

937
00:56:23,976 --> 00:56:26,578
Scott: Yeah So every day more and more games are getting randomized.

938
00:56:26,618 --> 00:56:28,225
Scott: has been Crystalis randomizer?

939
00:56:28,345 --> 00:56:30,673
Rym: crystalis won as much as I wanted to like it.

940
00:56:30,733 --> 00:56:32,880
Rym: crystalis is not a good game for that.

941
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,273
Scott: I'm just saying this mario 64 randomizer.

942
00:56:35,293 --> 00:56:36,560
Rym: is there different games?

943
00:56:37,463 --> 00:56:39,100
Scott: Lend themselves to randomization.

944
00:56:39,181 --> 00:56:41,159
Scott: It's sorry or worse than others.

945
00:56:41,361 --> 00:56:45,357
Rym: Like I feel like more drastic changes need to be made to make some of these viable.

946
00:56:45,377 --> 00:56:54,820
Rym: like crystalis I think they need to somehow like remove the grind to make it about map navigation Primarily map navigation and combat like stuff like that, right?

947
00:56:54,880 --> 00:57:02,550
Scott: But you know also if the games aren't that great to begin with yeah, like a randomizing Pizanadu isn't really gonna make it any better.

948
00:57:03,071 --> 00:57:03,432
Rym: Whoo.

949
00:57:03,793 --> 00:57:05,558
Rym: What about uh, dr.

950
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:05,980
Rym: Chaos?

951
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:07,784
Scott: You could do a randomized dr.

952
00:57:07,824 --> 00:57:08,968
Scott: Cas very easily.

953
00:57:09,049 --> 00:57:09,370
Scott: Dr.

954
00:57:09,410 --> 00:57:11,497
Scott: Chaos basically is already a random.

955
00:57:11,778 --> 00:57:14,072
Rym: I know dr Chaos actually is very like.

956
00:57:14,394 --> 00:57:15,903
Scott: it's not random at all But it's just.

957
00:57:16,144 --> 00:57:18,053
Scott: it feels like you're if you've never played it before.

958
00:57:18,395 --> 00:57:19,440
Scott: it feels like playing a random.

959
00:57:19,661 --> 00:57:21,850
Rym: I feel like I just take a speedrun of dr.

960
00:57:21,890 --> 00:57:28,440
Rym: Chaos as is and just post it and pretend It's a random is like a randomizer and people wouldn't know it would be an easy game to randomize.

961
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,711
Rym: Yeah, but I don't think there's a demand for the head.

962
00:57:31,731 --> 00:57:32,975
Rym: I don't think anyone why?

963
00:57:32,995 --> 00:57:34,360
Rym: I don't think anyone remembers that game.

964
00:57:35,421 --> 00:57:35,943
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

965
00:57:35,983 --> 00:57:44,089
Scott: so is the thing is like if you're someone who makes games right from that perspective if someone made a randomizer Of your game, right?

966
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:44,772
Scott: It's sort of like.

967
00:57:44,792 --> 00:57:46,560
Scott: I don't know how to feel about that.

968
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:49,897
Scott: It's like you could have just done that yourself and then made your game more popular.

969
00:57:49,937 --> 00:57:55,651
Rym: that way Yep, but also I think most randomizers will never become popular All right, and it's gonna come down to like.

970
00:57:56,396 --> 00:58:10,440
Rym: the real takeaway I think is that randomizers are scratching an itch that the world and the entire game industry Just like did not even recognize was there in any meaningful way and it came into the scene completely sideways, right?

971
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:16,340
Scott: Well, I kept saying for how many years it's like how come you don't make more of the thing that everyone already loves?

972
00:58:16,901 --> 00:58:24,040
Scott: You keep making new different things, you know, we need we want some not too much right but some more of the same.

973
00:58:24,502 --> 00:58:28,580
Scott: Repeat yourself, maybe at least one time Nintendo is making another breath of the wild kind of deal.

974
00:58:28,941 --> 00:58:30,630
Scott: Yeah, it seems like maybe they got the clue.

975
00:58:31,052 --> 00:58:36,035
Scott: It's like yeah if you do if you get a hit Let us hit one or two more times and then it'll get stale.

976
00:58:36,075 --> 00:58:36,677
Scott: then do something.

977
00:58:36,718 --> 00:58:37,039
Scott: move on.

978
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:38,645
Rym: I need some more.

979
00:58:38,685 --> 00:58:42,037
Rym: give me more - three right but shit like, you know shit.

980
00:58:42,077 --> 00:58:42,840
Scott: That was so good.

981
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,187
Scott: That has never been repeated.

982
00:58:44,248 --> 00:58:56,795
Rym: It's like well now we can do it but I think there's a broader takeaway that I don't know what's gonna happen, but I feel like Something from this randomizer community not now.

983
00:58:56,896 --> 00:58:57,860
Rym: I think it's gonna be years.

984
00:58:58,643 --> 00:59:03,523
Rym: I feel like the eSport that really takes off is gonna be.

985
00:59:03,924 --> 00:59:13,593
Rym: it's gonna take some elements from what is popular about these randomizers coupled with things we haven't envisioned yet and I feel like the eSport is not here yet.

986
00:59:13,714 --> 00:59:14,940
Rym: And this is what I mean.

987
00:59:15,101 --> 00:59:20,809
Scott: I mean the most basic thing right is to take say a common eSport like FPS battle Yeah, and it's like.

988
00:59:20,829 --> 00:59:21,514
Scott: how come?

989
00:59:21,535 --> 00:59:26,180
Scott: I don't got you know It's like we have procedurally generated games and we use them for roguelikes.

990
00:59:26,582 --> 00:59:33,468
Scott: We now you were now procedurally sort of manipulating older games Right to get these single-player experiences.

991
00:59:33,930 --> 00:59:36,758
Scott: Where is the procedurally generated multiplayer experience?

992
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:38,401
Scott: Right.

993
00:59:38,421 --> 00:59:40,148
Scott: How come there isn't like quake on a random map?

994
00:59:40,168 --> 00:59:42,218
Scott: You've never seen before because it computer just made it.

995
00:59:42,499 --> 00:59:43,906
Scott: Yep How come that doesn't exist?

996
00:59:44,087 --> 00:59:44,610
Scott: I haven't seen it.

997
00:59:44,651 --> 00:59:45,234
Scott: It might exist.

998
00:59:45,696 --> 00:59:46,219
Scott: I haven't seen it.

999
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:50,684
Rym: Well, like it edges the DDR competition where it's a song No one's ever heard before.

1000
00:59:50,825 --> 00:59:51,829
Scott: song no one's ever heard before.

1001
00:59:51,909 --> 00:59:56,228
Rym: arrows never seen before go up and then the game is just really different Skill than regular DDR.

1002
00:59:56,369 --> 00:59:56,590
Rym: Yep.

1003
00:59:56,711 --> 00:59:58,380
Rym: I am way better at that than I am at like.

1004
00:59:59,286 --> 01:00:10,300
Rym: Better at that than I have a better in real D Way better, but the other takeaway might end up being the like The random part in the sense that people can come back from behind.

1005
01:00:10,923 --> 01:00:17,789
Rym: I know coming back isn't actually a thing but like you can press your luck and like That's something that doesn't really exist in a lot of the current eSports.

1006
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:19,474
Rym: There's very little press your luck.

1007
01:00:19,735 --> 01:00:21,460
Rym: that is effective in eSports.

1008
01:00:21,983 --> 01:00:24,254
Scott: Well, you can't press your luck when there's no luck right.

1009
01:00:24,295 --> 01:00:27,713
Scott: a lot of these other games Like I said when their knowledge and skill based only.

1010
01:00:27,733 --> 01:00:31,099
Scott: it's not about luck It's about how well did you execute on that day?

1011
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:33,120
Rym: Meanwhile, look over the randomizer, right?

1012
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:34,987
Scott: The randomizer is still.

1013
01:00:35,389 --> 01:00:38,200
Scott: skill and knowledge still matter a lot.

1014
01:00:38,281 --> 01:00:40,500
Scott: If you don't have them, you're not going to win.

1015
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:43,420
Rym: In fact, you need them to know when and how to press your luck, right?

1016
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:48,480
Scott: But luck does suddenly come into it when it's a competition at least and not a. you know.

1017
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:54,999
Scott: You just playing you know, Zelda again - yeah and making it more fun by you know Mixing it up and not just playing the same exact game again.

1018
01:00:55,080 --> 01:01:00,704
Rym: But that luck is what makes it a spectator sport and I think that is why Randomizers took off.

1019
01:01:00,784 --> 01:01:04,740
Rym: It's that they're fun for the people who play them and fun for the people who watch them.

1020
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:07,509
Scott: Yep, but also you don't get old right?

1021
01:01:07,569 --> 01:01:09,515
Scott: And yeah, this is so this perfect.

1022
01:01:09,535 --> 01:01:11,160
Rym: There's no three true outcomes.

1023
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:14,436
Rym: Baseball there are not but think of it.

1024
01:01:14,476 --> 01:01:16,244
Rym: like hockey Hockey has the.

1025
01:01:16,465 --> 01:01:18,452
Rym: you can pull your fucking goalie if you want.

1026
01:01:18,652 --> 01:01:20,800
Rym: Yeah, and that adds so much excitement.

1027
01:01:21,701 --> 01:01:24,740
Rym: Most of the good randomizers like people do the equivalent of pull their goalie.

1028
01:01:24,941 --> 01:01:28,599
Scott: Oh, yeah, I like it pretty much every time I watch a speed running competition of any game.

1029
01:01:28,803 --> 01:01:36,080
Rym: Yeah I see some sort of goalie pulling Because you know I saw someone get in that fucking whale and go to the moon and no one else was on the moon.

1030
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:36,523
Scott: You're not?

1031
01:01:36,563 --> 01:01:39,000
Scott: you can't necessarily tell how the other players are doing.

1032
01:01:39,742 --> 01:01:40,285
Scott: You just had to.

1033
01:01:40,386 --> 01:01:42,660
Scott: it's like do I feel behind or do I feel ahead?

1034
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:44,812
Scott: Yeah, am I doing well or doing worse?

1035
01:01:44,872 --> 01:01:46,140
Scott: Well, how much time is on the clock?

1036
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:47,548
Scott: How many items do I have?

1037
01:01:47,588 --> 01:01:49,160
Scott: How much have I made progress right now?

1038
01:01:49,301 --> 01:01:52,160
Rym: Imagine playing this in like a stadium.

1039
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:54,327
Rym: Yeah, and you can't see the other screens.

1040
01:01:54,347 --> 01:01:59,851
Rym: like you're just doing your randomizer and suddenly this the crowd starts going crazy And you didn't do anything.

1041
01:02:00,152 --> 01:02:01,460
Scott: Well, that's why you can't hear the crowd either.

1042
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:04,272
Rym: Yeah, but that might actually make it even more exciting.

1043
01:02:04,292 --> 01:02:06,320
Rym: like suddenly you see the other players.

1044
01:02:06,481 --> 01:02:10,036
Scott: That is actually a negative of the competitive speedrunning scene.

1045
01:02:10,157 --> 01:02:10,458
Scott: Is that?

1046
01:02:11,101 --> 01:02:14,420
Scott: There's a big taboo about calling anyone out for cheating without evidence?

1047
01:02:14,742 --> 01:02:17,880
Scott: Usually all the ones I've seen stream have like 20-plus minute delays.

1048
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:24,380
Scott: I'm James is because you know We're racing me and Rimmer racing in a randomizer and I go right and Rym goes left.

1049
01:02:24,681 --> 01:02:26,630
Scott: Right if I can see what Rym's up to.

1050
01:02:26,731 --> 01:02:27,776
Scott: I see he gets the hammer.

1051
01:02:27,836 --> 01:02:28,640
Scott: Well, I just stop what I'm doing.

1052
01:02:28,741 --> 01:02:29,229
Scott: I go left.

1053
01:02:29,350 --> 01:02:30,181
Scott: Yep, right It's.

1054
01:02:30,281 --> 01:02:33,760
Rym: or if he sees that I'm falling behind he knows that he doesn't have to be that risky.

1055
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:48,547
Scott: Like you can play more conservatively Knowing, you know, you both have this because when you're competing you basically make the same exact random seed for both layers Not knowing what the other not having any information about the other player is Absolutely essential.

1056
01:02:48,627 --> 01:02:50,980
Scott: You must have that wall up like you're playing bridge.

1057
01:02:51,121 --> 01:02:53,780
Scott: No, that's otherwise the whole competitive aspect falls apart.

1058
01:02:53,940 --> 01:03:12,357
Rym: But that's where I wonder if in the further evolution like way beyond these randomizers now like eSports stuff Will know will revealing more information about your standing like your positional heuristic and your opponent Be a net positive or net negative for the game as a spectator sport in the long run.

1059
01:03:12,658 --> 01:03:16,300
Rym: right now It definitely is a net negative for the way randomizers work.

1060
01:03:16,702 --> 01:03:21,120
Rym: But I don't know what the future of game design looks like for that in the future.

1061
01:03:21,502 --> 01:03:23,953
Rym: I said in the future twice there because I'm really hungry.

1062
01:03:24,475 --> 01:03:25,499
Scott: I'm also really hungry.

1063
01:03:25,881 --> 01:03:30,300
Scott: But yeah, if you have never played a randomized game of any kind, right?

1064
01:03:30,781 --> 01:03:32,990
Scott: I would recommend looking up your favorite games.

1065
01:03:33,030 --> 01:03:38,229
Scott: that obviously not the newest newest games like Any SS NES era, right?

1066
01:03:38,249 --> 01:03:39,615
Rym: It's like the newest bar even in 64 games.

1067
01:03:41,001 --> 01:03:45,556
Scott: It's like the newer games are harder to randomize because the date you're basically manipulating.

1068
01:03:45,616 --> 01:03:52,380
Scott: you're looking at the ROM Technologically and shuffling the data in the ROM and a logical way to keep the game functioning.

1069
01:03:52,963 --> 01:03:56,320
Scott: But and consistent and beatable and there's a lot going on there.

1070
01:03:56,320 --> 01:04:01,752
Scott: It's not just like, you know, completely random bits, right and that is only you know.

1071
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:13,280
Scott: So think of some of your old favorite games and go out and find a community of people Who are playing those games and have a randomizer?

1072
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:16,350
Scott: obviously the more popular games are gonna have a bigger community of people.

1073
01:04:16,490 --> 01:04:22,509
Rym: but if you like like an obscure as any s game and Like say there's a pilot wings randomizer community.

1074
01:04:22,529 --> 01:04:24,175
Scott: I don't think there is no definitely not.

1075
01:04:24,215 --> 01:04:24,978
Rym: but say there was.

1076
01:04:24,998 --> 01:04:32,387
Rym: if You're the person who was so obsessed with pilot wings and you find the ten other people who together made a randomizer You're set.

1077
01:04:32,467 --> 01:04:36,556
Scott: it works best with games based on items Obviously right like link to the past.

1078
01:04:36,576 --> 01:04:37,100
Rym: There's a read.

1079
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:40,640
Rym: There's a lot of reasons why the link to the past one is like the iconic one, right?

1080
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:42,688
Scott: It's so strange that the link to the past one.

1081
01:04:42,708 --> 01:04:47,546
Scott: It's like they didn't make the game to be randomized But somehow it is.

1082
01:04:47,666 --> 01:05:00,638
Scott: it's as if it just by chance that the design of that game with the two worlds in the map Yep, it's just like it was as you couldn't make a better one if you try To predict the future of this space.

1083
01:05:00,698 --> 01:05:09,320
Scott: right now I'm like, why don't we just handcraft a brand new, you know Two maps cuz I don't in the past and try to make one that's like handcrafted and better?

1084
01:05:09,721 --> 01:05:10,463
Scott: It's like you couldn't.

1085
01:05:10,603 --> 01:05:17,722
Rym: it's so good cuz I don't think we still fully understand the extent of like what randomizers are Right.

1086
01:05:17,782 --> 01:05:21,737
Scott: It's like less than a roguelike where a roguelike randomizes everything like crazy.

1087
01:05:21,777 --> 01:05:22,480
Scott: It's like a net hack.

1088
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:27,360
Scott: It's all new dungeon every time man, you know, it's like it's only randomizing certain parts.

1089
01:05:27,641 --> 01:05:29,026
Rym: There are games that do that.

1090
01:05:29,066 --> 01:05:29,167
Rym: Like.

1091
01:05:29,187 --> 01:05:38,936
Rym: there are other kinds of like randomizer procedurally generated games But none of them also have this competitive aspect and the spectator aspect all rolled into one.

1092
01:05:39,036 --> 01:05:43,649
Rym: and the overlap with the speedrunning community I think Randomized everything.

1093
01:05:43,850 --> 01:05:53,564
Rym: I'm sure there's a net hack speedrun But like the advent of randomizers is something that if you asked me or Scott like on game design stuff 15 years ago Or 10 years ago.

1094
01:05:53,664 --> 01:05:55,832
Rym: even not no one could have predicted.

1095
01:05:55,852 --> 01:05:59,267
Scott: this has already been going on for a few years Yeah, but no one.

1096
01:05:59,287 --> 01:06:00,212
Scott: I want to solve this.

1097
01:06:00,393 --> 01:06:01,720
Scott: who made like the first one?

1098
01:06:01,841 --> 01:06:02,867
Scott: Yeah, like who came up?

1099
01:06:03,028 --> 01:06:04,134
Scott: who decided to do that?

1100
01:06:04,336 --> 01:06:05,000
Scott: It was so clever.

1101
01:06:05,334 --> 01:06:14,510
Rym: Yeah I feel like what you would find is someone made a rom hack once and like played it with their friends and then later the Scene started independently right at best, but this was like.

1102
01:06:15,132 --> 01:06:19,207
Rym: this is not something that the game design world Expected right.

1103
01:06:19,227 --> 01:06:28,200
Scott: It's like there been rom hacks for a long time But like even the best most polished awesome rom hacks warrant, you know, like I guess like the Zelda was a call under whatever.

1104
01:06:28,668 --> 01:06:33,752
Scott: Oh, yeah Some of those really weren't but they weren't much until now.

1105
01:06:33,792 --> 01:06:36,620
Scott: the random the randomized rom hack is suddenly a huge huge deal.

1106
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:38,894
Rym: I tried to play that like what bastard Zelda or whatever?

1107
01:06:38,915 --> 01:06:39,720
Rym: the really hard one.

1108
01:06:40,021 --> 01:06:41,726
Scott: Anyway, even I was like how hard could it be?

1109
01:06:41,766 --> 01:06:42,348
Scott: Fuck this?

1110
01:06:42,368 --> 01:06:46,460
Scott: Yeah, I recommend going to watch and/or try to play them.

1111
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:48,291
Scott: Don't worry if you can't beat them.

1112
01:06:48,311 --> 01:06:51,185
Scott: Yeah, or beat them quickly Just you know.

1113
01:06:51,948 --> 01:06:55,019
Scott: pick one that you were familiar with or maybe you know.

1114
01:06:55,481 --> 01:07:00,600
Scott: Actually, if you haven't actually played any of these legendary games, maybe you should do that first regardless of what randomizers.

1115
01:07:00,741 --> 01:07:01,950
Rym: But the two will link to.

1116
01:07:02,031 --> 01:07:02,413
Rym: is like.

1117
01:07:02,474 --> 01:07:06,019
Rym: there's the link to the past ones The one Scott's into and like most people are into that's the big one.

1118
01:07:06,544 --> 01:07:12,673
Rym: I'll link to the Final Fantasy one because RPG speedruns and RPG randomizers are a very different ballgame.

1119
01:07:12,753 --> 01:07:18,920
Scott: You also write want to check Super Metroid and oh, yeah So it's called smz3 is like I said the combo one.

1120
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:21,192
Scott: We're linked to the past and Metro is Super.

1121
01:07:21,212 --> 01:07:24,967
Scott: Metroid are joined at the hip Which is just watch that one.

1122
01:07:25,087 --> 01:07:29,200
Scott: You can't play that unless you're mad skilled because both of those games are very hard.

1123
01:07:29,340 --> 01:07:30,992
Scott: Yep, they are very hard games.

1124
01:07:31,677 --> 01:07:35,229
Scott: So You got to be mad skilled to be able to beat them both together.

1125
01:07:35,249 --> 01:07:39,300
Rym: I want to mash up bionic commando and anything.

1126
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:40,207
Rym: What are you randomizing?

1127
01:07:40,227 --> 01:07:40,912
Scott: bionic commando?

1128
01:07:41,294 --> 01:07:41,959
Rym: Oh, there are items.

1129
01:07:42,662 --> 01:07:44,347
Scott: Okay, are they the same kind of items?

1130
01:07:44,387 --> 01:07:45,190
Scott: like they unlock areas.

1131
01:07:45,210 --> 01:07:48,500
Rym: they unlock areas but there's weapons that unlock areas.

1132
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:51,810
Rym: There's also radio transceivers that unlock areas and the items.

1133
01:07:51,850 --> 01:07:55,664
Rym: there's a lot of doors and items can be different places and doors can go To different places.

1134
01:07:56,067 --> 01:07:56,852
Rym: you can make it work.

1135
01:07:57,174 --> 01:07:57,999
Scott: All right, go you do it.

1136
01:07:59,021 --> 01:08:03,435
Rym: I'm gonna look right now before we're in the show and see if anyone made a bionic commander randomizer.

1137
01:08:03,635 --> 01:08:03,796
Scott: Nope.

1138
01:08:04,277 --> 01:08:05,140
Rym: I don't think so.

1139
01:08:07,397 --> 01:08:09,627
Rym: This Has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1140
01:08:09,687 --> 01:08:14,823
Rym: special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1141
01:08:15,044 --> 01:08:20,060
Scott: be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes discussion news and more.

1142
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:27,740
Rym: Remember GeekNights is not one but four different shows sci-tech Mondays gaming Tuesdays anime comic Wednesdays and indiscriminate Thursdays.

Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons attribution 3.0 license.

1144
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:35,613
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1145
01:08:35,814 --> 01:08:45,957
Rym: But unlike those other late shows It's actually recorded at night and the patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights will be read momentarily.

1146
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:52,710
Rym: as you know We have a pretty new audio pipeline and new Equipment, so I'm just let me know.

1147
01:08:52,810 --> 01:08:54,700
Rym: Does the show sound better worse the same.

1148
01:08:55,162 --> 01:08:59,439
Rym: Is there any audio issue that might be bothering any of you with the current way the show sounds?

1149
01:09:00,615 --> 01:09:07,206
Rym: I'm Probably gonna finalize the new pipeline based on some feedback and leave it steady-state for a while But I'm pretty happy with this so far.

1150
01:09:07,709 --> 01:09:12,648
Rym: But anyway patreon patrons are Ellen Joyce Heidi McNichol Marty Green.

1151
01:09:12,667 --> 01:09:15,740
Rym: Yeah, just like a dude guy chartavish and linky G you hold the key to my heart.

1152
01:09:16,202 --> 01:09:18,328
Rym: I got in one little fight and my mom got scared.

1153
01:09:18,630 --> 01:09:21,019
Rym: Clinton Walton my stady calm.

1154
01:09:21,099 --> 01:09:24,033
Rym: J Bants written from New Zealand Ryan parent drew open.

1155
01:09:24,053 --> 01:09:39,359
Rym: Lander Nicholas Brando Chris midkiff Mac the thirst for hydrated Gannon dread lily tenebrae Chris Reimer Finn Sean Klein Thomas Hahn Shervin von Horl and a whole bunch of people who don't want me to say their name.

1156
01:09:41,023 --> 01:09:42,270
Rym: This is our last convention.

1157
01:09:42,330 --> 01:09:48,279
Rym: our lives are actually gonna get much less Busy after this meaning we can start making a lot more content doing a lot more stuff.

1158
01:09:48,501 --> 01:09:49,825
Rym: You're gonna see more page around things.

1159
01:09:49,885 --> 01:09:50,948
Rym: Rym's rants are coming back.

1160
01:09:50,988 --> 01:09:52,252
Rym: Remily reviews are coming back.

1161
01:09:52,734 --> 01:09:54,140
Rym: all this can be yours.

1162
01:09:54,401 --> 01:09:59,640
Rym: We are almost past the densest convention season we have had in the last eight years.

1163
01:10:00,205 --> 01:10:35,816
Rym: so now I leave you with Haba Haba Haba Haba Haba Haba Haba Haba Haba Haba Haba Haba Haba Haba Haba.

1164
01:10:54,542 --> 01:11:02,588
Scott: But that apart that they're back on top of that ha ha Gonna burn down this hard Baba.
