00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,130
Rym: It's Thursday April 23rd 2020.

2
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:12,912
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,534 --> 00:00:15,379
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:26,660
Rym: tonight We are going to revive an ancient ancient GeekNights tradition a series titled how to not suck tonight how to not suck at baking.

5
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:28,596
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,520
Rym: So yeah, we're just plugging along doing the show from home.

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,277
Rym: Hopefully the stream on YouTube is looking good because we're still using a new pipeline that I'm tweaking.

8
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:40,972
Rym: on Monday We'll talk about that pipeline and explain what we're doing it a little more depth.

9
00:00:41,253 --> 00:00:42,660
Rym: because I got some fancy.

10
00:00:43,101 --> 00:00:43,883
Rym: Well, not fancy.

11
00:00:43,903 --> 00:00:49,600
Rym: I actually got the lowest tier most bootleg possible hardware that I'm gonna try out this weekend.

12
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:51,651
Scott: Oh, yeah, you gotta let me know how that works.

13
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:52,759
Scott: And if it's good, I'll buy one.

14
00:00:53,302 --> 00:00:55,891
Rym: Yeah, because I bought the cheap one like the one that you sent me.

15
00:00:55,932 --> 00:00:58,140
Rym: I bought on Amazon instead of from Alibaba.

16
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:01,401
Rym: So I paid like an extra $40.

17
00:01:01,401 --> 00:01:03,793
Rym: All right, whatever just but it arrived.

18
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:04,919
Rym: it powered up.

19
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:10,020
Rym: I bought some wasabi batteries instead of the even more dubious bootleg batteries that I saw.

20
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:10,522
Rym: that's what I.

21
00:01:10,542 --> 00:01:31,859
Scott: that's also what I was gonna do cuz I that it seems like a lot of the I guess we're getting off topic here, but a lot of the various not super Pro AV equipment that you can buy like lights and Recorders and encoders and these little you know, the cheapo versions of these sorts of things for video at home.

22
00:01:32,643 --> 00:01:35,598
Scott: I'll take these particular model of Sony battery.

23
00:01:35,618 --> 00:01:36,803
Rym: Yep I have.

24
00:01:37,265 --> 00:01:41,200
Rym: I have three of the actual Sony battery and I have a pile of wasabi ones, right?

25
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,667
Scott: And it's like a battery that Sony camcorders use.

26
00:01:43,788 --> 00:01:47,500
Scott: so they're basically like hey most people are using these Sony camcorders.

27
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:48,765
Scott: They have these batteries.

28
00:01:48,866 --> 00:01:53,786
Scott: Let's make our stuff use the same battery and it must be a battery That's easy to interface with or something.

29
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:58,100
Rym: Yeah, but as a result the two little prong holes and like the top, right?

30
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:05,660
Scott: So it's like I got Panasonic shit and now I have to like, you know If I want a battery power any of this other stuff, I have to go out and buy Sony battery.

31
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,241
Scott: Yeah, so even better for devices I don't have.

32
00:02:08,383 --> 00:02:14,540
Rym: all my cameras are Panasonic, but every other device I have including my LED panels are Sony battery compatible.

33
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:22,160
Rym: Well, so I just have two piles of batteries and thankfully the two batteries for my camcorder were free because of the camera replacement.

34
00:02:22,723 --> 00:02:22,944
Scott: Yep.

35
00:02:22,984 --> 00:02:23,145
Scott: Yep.

36
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:23,386
Scott: Yep.

37
00:02:23,788 --> 00:02:25,256
Rym: But yeah so far I've streamed.

38
00:02:25,617 --> 00:02:38,178
Rym: you've streamed 5.7 gigabytes of data to me and I have streamed another 5.6 gigabytes of data to myself and then I've streamed 14 gigabytes of that to myself again And then I've streamed it to YouTube from there.

39
00:02:39,002 --> 00:02:43,200
Scott: Yeah, but to YouTube we're sending way less because youtubers under six megabits per second.

40
00:02:43,701 --> 00:02:46,450
Scott: Yeah, your your your encoder is chopping that down.

41
00:02:46,591 --> 00:02:57,460
Rym: Yep, and I'm using 61% of my Total horsepower on this machine to make this one using 12% I mean, I'm running to OBS and 12 and an nginx RTMP server.

42
00:02:58,411 --> 00:02:58,640
Scott: Okay.

43
00:02:59,683 --> 00:03:00,974
Rym: So yeah, there is some news.

44
00:03:01,256 --> 00:03:03,506
Rym: So Pax penny arcade Expo.

45
00:03:03,587 --> 00:03:07,400
Rym: as you know, we are not attending any conventions nor are we performing at any conventions?

46
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,407
Scott: Obviously until we're not gonna.

47
00:03:09,467 --> 00:03:13,080
Scott: right we might be but we're not gonna say we are until we are 100%.

48
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,466
Scott: No, we are but I can't.

49
00:03:14,988 --> 00:03:24,267
Rym: I can't say with certainty Pax West is the first Possible convention we would appear at as in the best case Scenario in the world is.

50
00:03:24,307 --> 00:03:29,744
Scott: we attend and perform at Pax West like right if you go to Pax West Thinking we're gonna be there.

51
00:03:29,864 --> 00:03:30,727
Scott: We might not be there.

52
00:03:30,807 --> 00:03:34,017
Rym: Yeah, like it happened ConnectiCon I'm not like.

53
00:03:34,097 --> 00:03:41,540
Rym: they've said they're still gonna happen But as we know conventions can't really say they're not gonna happen until they're forced to say they're not gonna happen in most right.

54
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:50,040
Scott: So so penny arcade announced that Pax West as of right now They want it to happen and they haven't canceled it yet and they're planning for it to happen.

55
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:58,126
Scott: Yeah, you shouldn't buy badges until you shouldn't buy tickets until I mean airplane tickets hotel rooms until Badges.

56
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,880
Rym: go on saying this is not like a normal year.

57
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:05,603
Rym: We're like I booked my flights for packs before they even start selling badges because I know I'm going Right.

58
00:04:05,623 --> 00:04:21,358
Scott: So this is because they posted an announcement that they're not canceled and I said, hey, yeah guys Conventions can't really announce that they're canceled because for example they might have a contract with the Convention Center now and that contract says you have to pay us to rent our building for these few days.

59
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,307
Scott: and If they just say you know what?

60
00:04:23,427 --> 00:04:25,799
Scott: Nah, I don't wanna then the Convention Center could be like.

61
00:04:25,819 --> 00:04:27,706
Scott: well We don't care if you have your convention or not.

62
00:04:27,746 --> 00:04:28,789
Scott: You got to pay right.

63
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:34,939
Scott: capitalism doesn't care about your human factors and care I like when you cancel a plane ticket, it's not refundable, right?

64
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:41,376
Scott: So but if an act of God were to happen like say a pandemic forcing them to cancel or

65
00:04:41,396 --> 00:04:42,740
Rym: smissure in some cases

66
00:04:43,444 --> 00:04:53,300
Scott: Right, so let's say the governor of Washington State says yeah No large gatherings more than a hundred people and that over and that time period includes PAX West PAX West as well.

67
00:04:54,164 --> 00:04:55,069
Scott: We didn't want to cancel.

68
00:04:55,110 --> 00:05:00,360
Scott: We just we just had to yep It's not we want to put the kids now they don't have to pay the convention center, right?

69
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:10,094
Scott: So that's why these events even though they might want to cancel right now They can't until they can you know, and there also might be other things.

70
00:05:10,175 --> 00:05:11,640
Scott: who knows what their agreements are?

71
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,333
Scott: They might have insurance that pays out.

72
00:05:13,374 --> 00:05:13,716
Scott: Who knows?

73
00:05:13,817 --> 00:05:21,318
Scott: Yep So as a result, you know penny arcade, I guess says Ryan Hartman replied to me right from penny arcade.

74
00:05:21,358 --> 00:05:21,920
Scott: So it's public.

75
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,683
Scott: It's out there on reddit.

76
00:05:22,703 --> 00:05:23,566
Scott: You can see the comment.

77
00:05:23,646 --> 00:05:24,749
Scott: So it's not a secret.

78
00:05:25,071 --> 00:05:32,660
Scott: Yeah, very carefully words, obviously He said we he says we were not forced to make an announcement because of some insurance clause.

79
00:05:32,801 --> 00:05:42,873
Scott: it's like okay, you weren't forced to make an announcement, but You didn't you know deny the fact that yeah, if you just cancel of your own volition, you could be both I would suspect.

80
00:05:42,954 --> 00:05:43,638
Rym: and I do not know.

81
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:53,055
Rym: again We have no knowledge about the internal workings of this, but I know at other non pax conventions It's not that we've had anyone has had to say anything.

82
00:05:53,176 --> 00:05:57,128
Rym: It's more that Not saying anything is also an option.

83
00:05:57,168 --> 00:06:00,920
Rym: You just can't say certain specific things yet, but I also not.

84
00:06:01,863 --> 00:06:13,076
Scott: Not saying anything also leads to lots of you know, while saying something can always get you a bad reaction Not saying anything can also get a bad reaction like hey, how come we haven't heard from X?

85
00:06:13,217 --> 00:06:15,228
Scott: right but nothing You don't say anything.

86
00:06:15,369 --> 00:06:15,671
Scott: I'm not.

87
00:06:15,691 --> 00:06:16,195
Scott: why have it?

88
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:24,300
Rym: I'm not a lawyer but not saying anything can get you in trouble with humans But it will often not get you in trouble with lawyers, right?

89
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:29,115
Scott: I'm just saying like, you know PR wise right if you don't say anything at all Someone might be like, how can we have it canceled yet?

90
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:29,720
Scott: You got it, right?

91
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,917
Rym: But if you're like I saw that what's all that happened?

92
00:06:31,937 --> 00:06:32,240
Rym: whistle.

93
00:06:32,501 --> 00:06:34,413
Rym: We just got to get out of these contracts like.

94
00:06:34,453 --> 00:06:36,522
Rym: that's gonna get you in trouble Right.

95
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:39,076
Scott: I saw like that happened with the bike club in New York City, right?

96
00:06:39,096 --> 00:06:39,760
Scott: They didn't cancel.

97
00:06:39,901 --> 00:06:42,359
Scott: They're like, yeah, we still want to ride, you know, they didn't say anything.

98
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,914
Scott: Yeah, and people were like, how come you haven't canceled all the rides yet?

99
00:06:44,954 --> 00:06:45,477
Scott: They're like fine.

100
00:06:45,517 --> 00:06:49,916
Scott: We canceled Yeah, right, but you know some people who were like, yeah, we don't.

101
00:06:49,957 --> 00:06:50,800
Scott: they said something.

102
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:56,700
Scott: They said we're not sure if we want to cancel yet, then people come out, you know for and against right?

103
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,040
Scott: Yeah and start yapping.

104
00:06:58,241 --> 00:07:00,328
Rym: So but Ryan gave a really really can't.

105
00:07:00,368 --> 00:07:03,984
Rym: you can't win response here because basically what it sounds like from and you can read the Like.

106
00:07:04,004 --> 00:07:13,579
Rym: don't think I'm gonna put words in Ryan's mouth But they're basically saying look we want to do packs if we can like we're hopeful But at the same time like don't buy your plane tickets yet guys.

107
00:07:14,123 --> 00:07:18,405
Scott: Seriously, and if you do Get refundable plane tickets.

108
00:07:18,465 --> 00:07:20,311
Scott: I heard from I don't know if this is true.

109
00:07:20,431 --> 00:07:26,215
Scott: I heard that Alaska Airlines which goes to Seattle Yeah is having refundable tickets for like the rest of the year.

110
00:07:26,235 --> 00:07:28,545
Scott: So Yeah, they go.

111
00:07:28,605 --> 00:07:30,175
Scott: So I go and that's true.

112
00:07:30,195 --> 00:07:30,638
Scott: It's inside.

113
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:32,320
Scott: Don't trust that.

114
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:32,781
Scott: I said it.

115
00:07:32,822 --> 00:07:46,600
Rym: verify it before you buy because I had made plans with Emily to travel to Japan like way before any of this Was even like before any of this happened And then we canceled to avoid flying through China and booked somewhere else and then had to cancel those.

116
00:07:46,961 --> 00:07:54,442
Rym: I ended up having like 10 grand worth of plane tickets that I couldn't use waiting for refunds for a significant amount of time Right.

117
00:07:54,462 --> 00:08:01,789
Scott: That's the thing is even if you can get your refund make sure you can afford to have your money tied up Because air China was very wealthy.

118
00:08:01,829 --> 00:08:03,697
Scott: You shouldn't be sending him any money on patreon.

119
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:04,300
Scott: Look at all the money.

120
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,967
Rym: Yeah air China was really good.

121
00:08:06,007 --> 00:08:07,554
Rym: They were like, yes, we'll give you a refund.

122
00:08:07,615 --> 00:08:08,780
Rym: the world's fucked right now.

123
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,683
Rym: Jesus like I like.

124
00:08:09,843 --> 00:08:15,220
Rym: air China was great, but the refund could be given to me within six to eight weeks.

125
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:32,472
Rym: So I was lucky that I had enough like space on my credit card to just hold on to that until they gave me my money back, but jail actually wouldn't let me cancel until like Shockingly close to like the dude the deadline for flying They did eventually let my cancer.

126
00:08:32,493 --> 00:08:37,880
Rym: basically every week They extended how far out they'd let you cancel for a refund by one week.

127
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:44,120
Rym: So every week they pushed it one more week one more week one more week and eventually after like four weeks I could cancel.

128
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:45,983
Scott: No, whatever.

129
00:08:46,063 --> 00:08:55,106
Rym: Yep, but if any of you out there are in a situation where like you have non refundable things and you got screwed by all this Charge back at the credit card.

130
00:08:55,186 --> 00:08:57,473
Rym: That is the secret hack of the world.

131
00:08:57,975 --> 00:08:58,777
Rym: use it together.

132
00:08:59,018 --> 00:08:59,660
Rym: use it in peace.

133
00:08:59,901 --> 00:09:01,447
Rym: Do not use it on small-time artists.

134
00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:04,960
Scott: You just have to be aware of the consequences of doing that.

135
00:09:05,221 --> 00:09:07,010
Rym: Yes, if you charge that I do it.

136
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,880
Scott: what if you do it when you shouldn't have done it?

137
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,844
Scott: Then you could be in trouble.

138
00:09:10,205 --> 00:09:13,720
Scott: You also might for example say you sign up for like an online service.

139
00:09:13,901 --> 00:09:14,804
Scott: Yeah, they scam you.

140
00:09:15,165 --> 00:09:18,014
Scott: so or you you right so you charge back.

141
00:09:18,436 --> 00:09:19,760
Scott: Well now they banned you forever.

142
00:09:19,881 --> 00:09:21,027
Scott: It's like you have to be willing to.

143
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:29,500
Rym: yeah, you're burning bridges when you charge back But charging back right now when this is an emergency can often be the way to protect yourself.

144
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,728
Scott: There are also sometimes fees for charging back.

145
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,053
Scott: Yeah, if it's not fraud.

146
00:09:33,635 --> 00:09:34,598
Rym: Yeah, it depends.

147
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:40,120
Rym: There's a lot of situations but Google charging back if you are desperate because of a situation like that.

148
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:47,959
Rym: I'm sure there's someone out there listening who is like holding on to some plane tickets or an Airbnb Reservation or something that they got screwed over on.

149
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,219
Scott: All right, you got any other news?

150
00:09:50,366 --> 00:10:03,615
Rym: Yeah So if you didn't notice we haven't talked about it at all because we generally try to avoid talking about Movies that are not that don't have a date Because movies can get done like post-production is done.

151
00:10:03,896 --> 00:10:05,020
Rym: The film is ready.

152
00:10:05,401 --> 00:10:08,696
Rym: It's about to be mailed to movie theaters and then the film disappears forever.

153
00:10:08,756 --> 00:10:09,720
Rym: No one sees it like that.

154
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:14,640
Scott: Look how many look how many stories there have been about live-action Akira live-action evangelical.

155
00:10:15,851 --> 00:10:22,722
Scott: As long as I can remember probably the entire millennium there have been ongoing stories about those two things and those two things have never Happened.

156
00:10:22,782 --> 00:10:23,646
Scott: it probably never will have.

157
00:10:23,687 --> 00:10:27,490
Rym: yep, but there is a dune Movie coming.

158
00:10:27,974 --> 00:10:30,128
Scott: It's Another one another one.

159
00:10:30,289 --> 00:10:34,669
Rym: Yeah, the problem is the dune movies I wanted to see are the ones that didn't come out.

160
00:10:35,271 --> 00:10:36,898
Scott: the judge draw ski whatever, right?

161
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:44,653
Scott: So if people don't know or you've probably if you you know, we did do it as a book club book You should go read at least the first dune book and then be done with it.

162
00:10:44,813 --> 00:10:48,933
Scott: Yeah, don't read any other dune books Just read about other dune books spoilers.

163
00:10:49,496 --> 00:10:50,160
Scott: Yeah anyway.

164
00:10:51,141 --> 00:10:55,840
Scott: So yeah, the there was the dune movie that actually came out which is something to see.

165
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,732
Rym: Yeah, I would not say it's terrible, but it is not great.

166
00:10:59,374 --> 00:11:07,133
Scott: No, but I mean it's it's just Movies, it's notable No worthy to go at the Prince of nothing.

167
00:11:07,153 --> 00:11:09,255
Rym: I Remember it.

168
00:11:10,301 --> 00:11:12,011
Scott: No, you know fear is the mind killer.

169
00:11:12,031 --> 00:11:13,680
Scott: you got to know you got to know your nerdy shit, right?

170
00:11:14,861 --> 00:11:20,599
Scott: And then there were these other dune movies that didn't actually get finished much like the Akira and Evangelion.

171
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,975
Scott: live-action Dude is what it is possible to approach right?

172
00:11:24,996 --> 00:11:26,140
Scott: There's a documentary right?

173
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:26,521
Scott: It's judge.

174
00:11:26,581 --> 00:11:34,369
Scott: Oskie's dune is like there's a documentary of the movie about movies that didn't get made Right and how great that they were gonna be.

175
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:36,017
Scott: who knows that they're actually gonna be great?

176
00:11:36,077 --> 00:11:38,419
Scott: the doc, you know It could just be showing them in a great light.

177
00:11:39,503 --> 00:11:44,439
Rym: I think it definitely would have been memorable even if it wasn't great like the one that did come out.

178
00:11:44,479 --> 00:11:46,824
Rym: Yeah But the new one.

179
00:11:46,844 --> 00:11:49,172
Rym: that's coming from what I have read.

180
00:11:49,252 --> 00:11:54,548
Rym: cuz I follow that maudib style Twitter account Which is like maudib maudib maudu.

181
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:55,110
Rym: Yeah, it's.

182
00:11:56,885 --> 00:11:57,713
Rym: It is an A+.

183
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:05,999
Scott: Basically, this account has spent like maudib sounds like a snack that like kids are dipping dip dabs Yeah, something like that.

184
00:12:06,361 --> 00:12:16,460
Rym: but that Twitter account mostly existed just a shitpost dune memes that really Did not make sense to most people who are not so the bed and the best kind of dune exactly.

185
00:12:17,042 --> 00:12:19,370
Rym: but that accounts been talking a lot about the movie and I've been.

186
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:19,631
Rym: actually.

187
00:12:19,651 --> 00:12:24,940
Rym: I actually started reading about like who they cast and I looked at some of the stills from the principal photography.

188
00:12:25,901 --> 00:12:33,332
Rym: I'm not saying it's gonna be good, but it has a chance of being good and I'm pretty confident It's actually gonna come out.

189
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,168
Rym: Oh Like it looks like it's gonna come out.

190
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,840
Scott: I mean that second Blade Runner movie came out, right?

191
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:52,154
Rym: Yeah, and that Blade Runner movie, uh, if you have not seen the second Blade Runner movie You should go see it because it is actually fantastic Like I say this being in loving the original Blade Runner.

192
00:12:52,174 --> 00:12:53,780
Rym: It is a worthy sequel.

193
00:12:54,562 --> 00:12:55,265
Scott: Yeah, ain't bad.

194
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:59,780
Rym: Like it is it is equally good but different good for different reasons.

195
00:13:00,344 --> 00:13:06,180
Scott: You know, not that Ghostbusters came out right new Right, so the duo they're actually successfully releasing these things.

196
00:13:06,521 --> 00:13:15,771
Rym: but I have over the last few weeks moved from being aware that there is a dune movie coming to being Cautiously optimistic about liking the dune.

197
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:16,613
Scott: That's a dangerous.

198
00:13:16,633 --> 00:13:17,356
Scott: That's dangerous place.

199
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:18,319
Rym: I know it's dangerous.

200
00:13:18,359 --> 00:13:20,485
Scott: That's why I am not going to that.

201
00:13:20,805 --> 00:13:30,553
Rym: I'm not going there with you fast forward going alone GeekNights GeekNights on April 23rd 2030 when Scott's like hey, weren't you excited about that dune movie?

202
00:13:30,573 --> 00:13:31,455
Rym: that never came out.

203
00:13:31,496 --> 00:13:39,759
Scott: and I'll be like, yeah I'll be like, oh I'm gonna go see live-action Akira tomorrow Got my tickets already.

204
00:13:41,482 --> 00:13:44,679
Rym: And a brief little news not a meta moment because it's not technically GeekNights.

205
00:13:45,001 --> 00:13:49,220
Rym: But Emily and I watched Dumbo again the other night recorded and we're gonna record a podcast.

206
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,447
Scott: Did you watch original racist Dumbo?

207
00:13:51,848 --> 00:13:54,095
Rym: We watched the Disney Plus version.

208
00:13:54,797 --> 00:13:55,900
Scott: has it been d-racist?

209
00:13:56,521 --> 00:13:57,845
Rym: So it has the crew we'll talk about.

210
00:13:57,865 --> 00:14:07,798
Rym: so we're gonna do a podcast and talk about that because there are two Things in that movie that need to be discussed that are related to racism and it is not only two.

211
00:14:08,441 --> 00:14:10,619
Rym: There are two specific things.

212
00:14:11,442 --> 00:14:17,382
Rym: Okay, I think there's a lot more than but there are two that are very specific and relevant to this discourse that we are going To discuss.

213
00:14:17,803 --> 00:14:20,693
Scott: but I'm like a Dumbo, you know Dumbo terms of.

214
00:14:21,596 --> 00:14:22,920
Rym: I learned something about Dumbo.

215
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:23,464
Rym: I didn't know.

216
00:14:23,604 --> 00:14:24,832
Rym: Dumbo is one of the first movies.

217
00:14:24,853 --> 00:14:25,980
Rym: Do you synthesize voices?

218
00:14:27,521 --> 00:14:27,802
Scott: Really?

219
00:14:27,883 --> 00:14:31,136
Scott: Yeah, there is a for which I didn't know that and a lot of things about Dumbo.

220
00:14:31,156 --> 00:14:32,220
Rym: when the train is talking.

221
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:36,573
Rym: That is a like full-on fucking synthesized voice similar to.

222
00:14:36,593 --> 00:14:40,183
Scott: I thought it was a person talking into like a like a. you know Kazoo type thing.

223
00:14:40,284 --> 00:14:47,787
Rym: No, it's more akin to the early instruments where you could talk through your guitar Because when it's like I think I can't.

224
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,419
Scott: I think yeah, it's like a person talking through like a filter.

225
00:14:50,539 --> 00:14:55,524
Rym: Yes It's basically a person talking through an early synthesizer So, but that's not.

226
00:14:55,564 --> 00:14:57,774
Scott: it's not a synthesizer for persons talking into it.

227
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:04,680
Scott: that's just like a. you know I'll talk about it when we do the podcast and synthesizer would be like sin a star where it's like rotten coward.

228
00:15:05,061 --> 00:15:09,374
Rym: Yes, but it was a synthetic voice and I can explain the details.

229
00:15:09,615 --> 00:15:13,579
Rym: It's kind of like how Fantasia had that ridiculously complicated nine-track audio.

230
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:21,299
Rym: This was like an early version of modern voice synth technology with a lot of limitations and a lot of.

231
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:23,445
Rym: What did I describe this?

232
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:24,268
Rym: to chase the other day?

233
00:15:24,288 --> 00:15:26,518
Rym: the audio equivalent of rotoscoping.

234
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:33,620
Rym: But we're not gonna upload the Dumbo episode yet because we got too excited and watch Dumbo first.

235
00:15:33,981 --> 00:15:40,840
Rym: So we have not yet watched and recorded an episode on a movie that came out before Dumbo and after Fantasia the reluctant dragon.

236
00:15:41,721 --> 00:15:43,167
Scott: I haven't heard of the reluctant dragon ever.

237
00:15:43,348 --> 00:15:43,629
Scott: Really?

238
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:44,412
Rym: I've heard of it.

239
00:15:44,432 --> 00:15:46,560
Rym: I've just never seen it, but I'm a Pete's dragon.

240
00:15:47,223 --> 00:15:48,971
Rym: Oh, yeah, I remember Pete's dragon as a kid.

241
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:49,594
Scott: I don't know.

242
00:15:49,695 --> 00:15:50,780
Scott: I don't know the reluctant dragon.

243
00:15:51,304 --> 00:16:03,760
Rym: I as a kid loved the shit out of Pete's dragon But I suspect I do not want to watch that movie again Lest I ruin my memories because I do not think that movie is good and I suspect that it will not hold up.

244
00:16:05,021 --> 00:16:06,649
Scott: Dumbo holds up except for the racism.

245
00:16:06,749 --> 00:16:09,080
Rym: Yeah, and the racism is less.

246
00:16:09,944 --> 00:16:13,220
Rym: It is not as bad as the racism in Fantasia.

247
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,668
Scott: Good Lord says white person.

248
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:20,440
Rym: Yeah, go go watch Fantasia and look at what they cut out.

249
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,891
Rym: I'm really glad Disney cut that out of the Disney.

250
00:16:23,931 --> 00:16:26,880
Scott: I don't really remember what racism was cut out of Fantasia.

251
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,615
Rym: Yeah, there are some centaurs that have been removed for a really good reason.

252
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,423
Scott: Oh Yeah, they are.

253
00:16:31,603 --> 00:16:33,008
Scott: I do not remember those centaurs.

254
00:16:33,048 --> 00:16:35,938
Scott: But then again, I've seen Dumbo maybe a hundred times.

255
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:44,428
Rym: They're so bad that many less temporary newspapers like Contemporary newspapers to when Fantasia come came out.

256
00:16:44,468 --> 00:16:45,932
Rym: We're like, holy shit.

257
00:16:45,952 --> 00:16:46,775
Rym: That was racist.

258
00:16:47,657 --> 00:16:48,139
Scott: Oh, wow.

259
00:16:48,179 --> 00:16:58,164
Rym: Yeah But otherwise Let's get into things of the day.

260
00:16:58,185 --> 00:16:58,588
Rym: What do you got?

261
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:07,199
Scott: So yeah, so this is dude, I actually still don't know if it's a Korean dude or a Japanese dude But what does it matter right?

262
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,145
Scott: I think they live it.

263
00:17:08,185 --> 00:17:08,929
Scott: they live in Korea.

264
00:17:09,371 --> 00:17:14,263
Scott: They clearly speak Japanese and Korean and English and this dude is named night tempo.

265
00:17:14,364 --> 00:17:22,270
Scott: That's the only name I know of this person And I discovered night tempo because I went to a future funk.

266
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:28,760
Scott: You know dance, I guess party club show whatever when that was still a thing you could do.

267
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:47,949
Scott: And night tempo appeared and I was like at first I saw this person in the crowd who looked like a time traveler from 80s Japan wearing like a full Puma like windbreak II tracksuit kind of thing That was clearly vintage that right and like those giant glasses, right?

268
00:17:49,491 --> 00:17:55,633
Scott: And this this really wild haircut and I was like that person looks like they just were a time traveler from 80s Japan.

269
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:57,190
Scott: what are they, you know, that's pretty cool.

270
00:17:57,672 --> 00:18:01,770
Scott: And then that person who is you know, like before the show they were down, you know low.

271
00:18:01,911 --> 00:18:03,418
Scott: So I thought that they were like an attendee.

272
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,067
Scott: No, that was night tempo.

273
00:18:05,087 --> 00:18:05,670
Scott: who right?

274
00:18:07,556 --> 00:18:13,825
Scott: So Night tempo is like been like increasing their.

275
00:18:14,306 --> 00:18:17,597
Scott: I don't know how you say this Prominence, I don't know whatever.

276
00:18:17,737 --> 00:18:19,283
Rym: right for once with a capital P.

277
00:18:19,885 --> 00:18:21,370
Scott: Yeah, so think about this, right?

278
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:24,463
Scott: There are a lot of nerds out there who have nostalgia, right?

279
00:18:24,543 --> 00:18:25,085
Scott: That's love.

280
00:18:25,266 --> 00:18:26,932
Scott: That's like most nerds I think and have.

281
00:18:26,952 --> 00:18:33,250
Scott: a lot of nerds have a nostalgia for a specific thing and they'll often express this nostalgia by like collecting, right?

282
00:18:34,636 --> 00:18:34,941
Scott: you know.

283
00:18:34,961 --> 00:18:39,550
Scott: or Getting into communities of people who share the nostalgia, right?

284
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:50,314
Scott: But you know It's very rare that a nerd with nostalgia for something who's right will then sort of actually help To revive that thing.

285
00:18:50,334 --> 00:18:51,678
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

286
00:18:51,938 --> 00:18:56,650
Scott: it's like how many model train nerds are out there right with their hardcore model train nostalgia.

287
00:18:56,791 --> 00:19:00,210
Rym: But who's driving the model train community to get them on Twitch, right?

288
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:00,672
Scott: They can't.

289
00:19:01,194 --> 00:19:08,750
Scott: none of them can push the model train community forward any more Than the model trains that they set up during holiday season and then tear down.

290
00:19:10,071 --> 00:19:10,993
Scott: That's their peak.

291
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:20,750
Rym: the speed running community was pretty moribund until a few people like really worked to push it Broader into the mainstream and make it more accessible and interesting.

292
00:19:21,914 --> 00:19:28,299
Scott: right exactly, so you know the Night tempo has nostalgia for.

293
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,710
Scott: you know, showa idols showa era Japan.

294
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:39,515
Scott: Yeah, you know things like red plastic cassette Walkman Urisei Yatsura wristwatches.

295
00:19:39,876 --> 00:19:46,726
Scott: the point is right that this the the number one thing that night tempo is all about is old City pop music from the 80s, right?

296
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:55,849
Scott: So a lot of people don't know city pop music if they weren't Japanese people in the 80s right and it's sort of just the genre sort of disappeared mostly.

297
00:19:56,611 --> 00:20:00,324
Scott: But there happens to be this overlap of anime.

298
00:20:00,344 --> 00:20:08,390
Scott: nerds who watched 80s anime Who have heard these sorts of sounds right like if you listen to like the original Macross TV soundtrack.

299
00:20:09,135 --> 00:20:11,230
Scott: It's very city pop, right?

300
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:15,250
Scott: You just didn't realize that that was the genre at the time, right?

301
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:20,150
Scott: And you know the most famous city pop song at least in the West perhaps in the world.

302
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:23,688
Scott: you know his plastic love by Maria Takeuchi, right.

303
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:29,501
Scott: and Maria Takeuchi She was being interviewed somewhere, right?

304
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:32,190
Scott: I just saw a short very brief clip, right?

305
00:20:32,813 --> 00:20:38,962
Scott: And in this clip she says right Arigato night tempo son.

306
00:20:39,284 --> 00:20:42,750
Scott: Ooh So that would be like if 4x games died.

307
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:50,480
Scott: no one played them and then I went out and I made some remixes of and mods for civilization and they got popular.

308
00:20:50,500 --> 00:21:00,029
Scott: and Sid Meyer was like, thank you Scott Rubin right For bringing back 4x games and making people care about them again.

309
00:21:01,282 --> 00:21:14,225
Scott: So you know if you have any nostalgia for the city pop sound because you watch old anime or not or you're a Japanese person from the 80s or I don't know but It's good music

310
00:21:15,851 --> 00:21:21,008
Rym: Jax while you're talking these are that that like reverberating echo of that synth bass beat.

311
00:21:21,108 --> 00:21:21,509
Rym: Oh, man

312
00:21:22,413 --> 00:21:50,281
Scott: right, so night tempo just released the third and final installment of His series Showa idols groove in which he takes hit tracks from Showa era idols right and remixes them to make them bangin for the 2020s As if a time traveler as it's as if the coolest DJ from 80s Japan time traveled to 2020 and learned how to use a computer.

313
00:21:50,302 --> 00:21:52,849
Scott: Yeah, right that could make music.

314
00:21:54,391 --> 00:22:02,682
Scott: So Yeah, you got you have to go to band camp to get these because I'm pretty sure you can't put this one's on Spotify But some of his other music is on Spotify.

315
00:22:02,703 --> 00:22:04,630
Scott: that can be put on Spotify, right?

316
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:11,477
Scott: So but band camp is the way to go and this particular album is pay what you want So you can download it for $0 $1.

317
00:22:11,477 --> 00:22:17,726
Rym: Oh, man I scroll down and it's like oh if you like this you'll also like the first thing I see.

318
00:22:17,766 --> 00:22:20,369
Rym: there is sailorwave Which I'm already familiar with.

319
00:22:20,993 --> 00:22:28,829
Scott: Yes, so there's a if you don't know there's a company I think it's in Hong Kong called neon city records and it's someone who basically has.

320
00:22:29,493 --> 00:22:45,254
Scott: There's a story about neon city records actually on bandcamp if you search for it I don't have the link right now that tells the story of how they were created But what I hear it is basically someone had the ability to produce vinyl records and cassette tapes and Like this kind of music.

321
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:58,738
Scott: so they made a little tiny record company and got all of these similar sounding people together Right to make music and they do very limited runs of vinyl albums and cassette tapes Right, so you could buy.

322
00:22:58,778 --> 00:23:00,690
Scott: show idols grew its price sold out now, right?

323
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:01,975
Scott: Because they only make so many.

324
00:23:02,317 --> 00:23:04,949
Scott: but you could have bought this album on cassette or vinyl, right?

325
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:14,115
Scott: And they do really fancy production like neon colored records, you know, really awesome artwork inserts in the tapes Of course, I wouldn't buy any of those cuz.

326
00:23:14,797 --> 00:23:16,403
Rym: yeah, I don't want physical things anymore.

327
00:23:16,624 --> 00:23:17,868
Scott: I'll take I'll take the mp3s, please.

328
00:23:19,651 --> 00:23:22,128
Scott: Maybe maybe you want a vinyl that just sounds shittier.

329
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:31,330
Rym: So speaking of sound my thing of the day, you know Nintendo Labo like the cool cardboard thing where you can just like make stuff.

330
00:23:31,854 --> 00:23:42,268
Rym: what are the things you can make is a little keyboard and And you can make these little like waveform things you stick in and that determines what sample will play when you plan your tiny little like synth keyboard

331
00:23:42,993 --> 00:23:43,197
Scott: mm-hmm,

332
00:23:43,605 --> 00:23:48,664
Rym: so It turns out it actually does just look at the like.

333
00:23:48,985 --> 00:23:55,623
Rym: the shape of that Specific waveform like the piece that you put in is the sample.

334
00:23:55,723 --> 00:23:59,518
Rym: It's actually the shape of the wave of the sample Mm-hmm.

335
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:03,596
Scott: So this people don't realize that The Nintendo joy cons?

336
00:24:03,636 --> 00:24:04,900
Scott: if you have some joy cons nearby.

337
00:24:04,961 --> 00:24:05,603
Scott: look at the front.

338
00:24:05,763 --> 00:24:10,641
Scott: They have a little infrared camera on the front And there's almost nothing that uses that.

339
00:24:10,762 --> 00:24:14,483
Scott: but Labo uses it excessively Yep, so that's what's.

340
00:24:14,563 --> 00:24:15,410
Scott: that's how they're doing that.

341
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:17,117
Rym: so this video is not gonna get into.

342
00:24:17,157 --> 00:24:18,824
Rym: like all the cool stuff you can do with a Nintendo thing.

343
00:24:18,844 --> 00:24:31,449
Rym: the video shows how Because the shape of those samples is the actual wave how you can isolate Any sound or sample you want as long as you can make it short enough.

344
00:24:32,293 --> 00:24:36,790
Rym: 3d print your own sample and use it with the Nintendo Labo keyboard.

345
00:24:37,334 --> 00:24:38,240
Scott: I mean you get 3d.

346
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,690
Scott: printing would get you a lot of precision.

347
00:24:39,791 --> 00:24:42,051
Scott: But you could just take a piece of cardboard and yeah You

348
00:24:42,071 --> 00:24:45,628
Rym: can cut this out of construction paper if you really wanted to and it would totally work

349
00:24:46,231 --> 00:24:48,378
Scott: Usually be good at cutting and be really precise and

350
00:24:48,398 --> 00:24:58,998
Rym: you have to understand audio enough to be able to basically go to audition and zoom all the way in to a wave where you see individual points and then Like isolate the point at which it loops

351
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:07,172
Scott: and then you have to you'd have to scale the image and print it properly Onto a piece of paper and then cut the paper along the line very precisely Yeah,

352
00:25:07,212 --> 00:25:10,446
Rym: but he shows you can just do this in like Photoshop like it'll totally work.

353
00:25:10,808 --> 00:25:13,102
Scott: and yeah You just have to know that the math it's not.

354
00:25:13,122 --> 00:25:13,424
Scott: it's not hard.

355
00:25:13,444 --> 00:25:14,859
Rym: You don't need to know the math at all Just draw it.

356
00:25:15,611 --> 00:25:18,150
Scott: Well, I mean the math to scale the thing to the right size.

357
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:20,719
Rym: It doesn't matter as long as it's proportionally the same.

358
00:25:20,739 --> 00:25:21,422
Rym: It does not matter.

359
00:25:22,024 --> 00:25:23,369
Scott: Oh really it scales on its own.

360
00:25:23,529 --> 00:25:25,417
Rym: Yeah It's just a proportional thing.

361
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:26,561
Rym: Just get the wave file.

362
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:28,610
Scott: So Nintendo's doing the math for you.

363
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:30,474
Rym: Yeah so it's pretty easy.

364
00:25:30,514 --> 00:25:33,926
Rym: the video is like eight minutes long and a lot of it's just set up like.

365
00:25:33,946 --> 00:25:35,491
Rym: it explains exactly how to Do it.

366
00:25:35,813 --> 00:25:42,138
Rym: and if you don't have like audition and the fancy software it even shows you like Here's all the tools you can use to just make this happen.

367
00:25:42,158 --> 00:25:46,010
Scott: You should just make a Mario Paint set Swan Gameboy mushroom.

368
00:25:46,291 --> 00:25:50,124
Rym: Oh, he goes and gets some some Donkey Kong Country samples and sticks them in here.

369
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:51,368
Scott: Oh nice.

370
00:25:51,428 --> 00:26:00,963
Rym: Yeah All right, in a moment GeekNights book club is the tale of Hanjo Because we tell of Genji not Hanjo, yeah, cuz we're not.

371
00:26:01,465 --> 00:26:08,330
Rym: we're not Hanzoing through this book Hanjoing through it because turns out we only read when we're pooping outside of our own house and riding the subway.

372
00:26:09,053 --> 00:26:10,922
Scott: I kept saying that my policy was.

373
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:12,770
Scott: I even just told this to my co-workers the other day.

374
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:14,450
Scott: Everyone's like reading any books and I'm like man.

375
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:22,196
Scott: I had this policy of like when you're on the subway don't open a game on your phone only open the Kindle app on your Phone right now.

376
00:26:22,898 --> 00:26:24,122
Scott: I don't ride the subway.

377
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:26,088
Scott: So I don't reckon open the Kindle app, right?

378
00:26:26,128 --> 00:26:26,830
Scott: I got all this other shit.

379
00:26:26,991 --> 00:26:27,432
Scott: I'm at home.

380
00:26:27,492 --> 00:26:28,597
Scott: I can like play my switch.

381
00:26:28,978 --> 00:26:30,685
Scott: All right, I can play my computer.

382
00:26:30,966 --> 00:26:32,030
Scott: I can do all kinds of stuff.

383
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:34,826
Scott: Why would I you know, why would I sit on my phone with the Kindle app?

384
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:41,858
Rym: Yeah Yep, and most of my free time is spent either futzing around with like this streaming kit We set up so Scott's face can appear.

385
00:26:41,878 --> 00:26:43,225
Rym: I had all those things like.

386
00:26:43,246 --> 00:26:44,090
Rym: we're working on projects.

387
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:53,093
Rym: I'm working on a lot of stuff also playing a lot of overwatch and a lot of Civ 6 like a lot of Civ 6.

388
00:26:53,093 --> 00:26:54,781
Scott: Mmm, I'm playing a little bit of Civ 6.

389
00:26:54,781 --> 00:26:56,650
Rym: Yeah, but you've been playing in our live games.

390
00:26:56,971 --> 00:27:05,772
Rym: I never thought I'd get to a point when I'm you know approaching 40 and Yet I will sit down for four hours and play civilization alive with other people Like.

391
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:08,645
Scott: well, this is letting us get a little taste of the retirement home.

392
00:27:08,665 --> 00:27:19,024
Rym: Yeah early I feel like our generation more so than all many generations before us looks forward to retirement Assuming we overthrow capitalism and have an actual socialist democracy.

393
00:27:19,626 --> 00:27:20,550
Rym: So retirement happen.

394
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:24,482
Rym: I look forward to having infinite free time and no responsibilities.

395
00:27:24,783 --> 00:27:31,262
Rym: Even if I'm in like a really simple cubicle home Playing like King Arthur Pendragon with like all of my friends.

396
00:27:31,844 --> 00:27:32,465
Scott: I got it ready.

397
00:27:32,505 --> 00:27:32,947
Scott: I'm working on.

398
00:27:32,967 --> 00:27:33,368
Rym: I got it.

399
00:27:33,428 --> 00:27:34,070
Rym: sit right over there.

400
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:35,017
Rym: It's still in the shrink-wrap.

401
00:27:35,057 --> 00:27:36,790
Rym: I'm gonna open a shrink-wrap when I turn six.

402
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:37,432
Scott: We're gonna.

403
00:27:37,793 --> 00:27:39,299
Scott: we're gonna come out when we're super old.

404
00:27:39,339 --> 00:27:41,486
Scott: I can be like I've been preparing this campaign for 30 years.

405
00:27:41,527 --> 00:27:41,848
Rym: Let's go.

406
00:27:42,069 --> 00:27:47,100
Rym: Yep I I'm gonna play so many like RPGs when I'm old.

407
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,407
Rym: It's gonna be a good time, but we're not there yet.

408
00:27:49,909 --> 00:27:53,558
Rym: So otherwise Don't have any conventions to talk about.

409
00:27:53,718 --> 00:27:56,650
Rym: don't have any like projects to talk about until we release them.

410
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:59,989
Rym: We're not gonna reveal all these projects until we actually do them.

411
00:28:00,391 --> 00:28:04,828
Rym: So we actually are forced to do them and not just get the feel-good feelings from saying we're gonna do them.

412
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:15,437
Rym: So let's talk about baking cuz that's the other thing We're spending a lot of our time on and considering there's basically nowhere I can get bread flour I think everyone else is doing the same thing.

413
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,425
Scott: Well, we got a ton of bread flour.

414
00:28:17,525 --> 00:28:19,291
Scott: I mean, yeah, we got a ton of regular Flour.

415
00:28:19,412 --> 00:28:23,444
Rym: Yeah, I have 44 more pounds of regular flour hanging out in there.

416
00:28:23,464 --> 00:28:25,430
Scott: Well, I got plenty of bread flour also.

417
00:28:25,571 --> 00:28:31,110
Scott: Yeah, yeah, I mean baking is something I've always You know been into even before college, right?

418
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:38,629
Scott: I used to bake when I was I'd make banana breads and cookies back in my middle, you know, even elementary school I guess I don't know like way more than me.

419
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:46,159
Rym: I really only baked in like middle middle in high school and then in college I didn't like I technically baked but in college I was just looking for calories.

420
00:28:46,199 --> 00:28:52,387
Rym: So my baking was mostly restricted to Johnny cakes and like yeah, I can cornbread from a mix.

421
00:28:52,448 --> 00:28:56,610
Rym: isn't baking Technically baking the worst possible form of baking?

422
00:28:57,192 --> 00:29:01,250
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know as soon as my mom let me lick the spoon with the cookie dough on it, right?

423
00:29:01,391 --> 00:29:04,150
Scott: I was like, I gotta learn how to make that cookie dough on my own.

424
00:29:04,593 --> 00:29:07,250
Rym: I remember the moment as a kid of wait, I can just make cookies.

425
00:29:07,692 --> 00:29:10,730
Rym: I could just go into the kitchen and when I'm done there's cookies, right?

426
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:11,051
Scott: It's like.

427
00:29:11,071 --> 00:29:13,142
Scott: however, I was like I gotta be able to do that.

428
00:29:13,584 --> 00:29:14,810
Scott: Yeah, that's something I got to learn.

429
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,597
Scott: So I've been doing it ever since right?

430
00:29:16,637 --> 00:29:21,138
Scott: So I know a lot of people out there are like, ah, I can't bake Suck it bacon.

431
00:29:21,198 --> 00:29:21,742
Scott: I can't do it.

432
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:22,749
Scott: Right, right, right.

433
00:29:23,291 --> 00:29:26,885
Scott: So I get to tell you how not to suck at baking because I think that's a bunch of bullshit.

434
00:29:26,906 --> 00:29:29,234
Scott: cuz baking is super easy Especially compared to cooking.

435
00:29:29,736 --> 00:29:36,356
Scott: because cooking right is a little bit sort of like Performing jazz or improv music.

436
00:29:36,416 --> 00:29:44,050
Scott: right you have to understand, you know the rules of music or food Right, and then you had to sort of mix things up, right?

437
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:45,758
Scott: You can sort of you know, you know what to be.

438
00:29:45,778 --> 00:29:47,225
Scott: you could add more ingredient less.

439
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:53,730
Scott: It doesn't matter too much Right, you can throw in a different ingredient because it's not gonna be too much of a big deal, right?

440
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,256
Scott: You know you heat up some oil in a pan.

441
00:29:55,276 --> 00:29:56,381
Scott: You throw some stuff in there.

442
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:56,903
Scott: You cook it.

443
00:29:57,325 --> 00:29:58,048
Scott: Whatever right?

444
00:29:58,068 --> 00:30:01,741
Scott: It's cooking Whereas baking is like chemistry.

445
00:30:02,002 --> 00:30:03,750
Rym: Yeah, but that's an important point.

446
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:10,913
Rym: The fact that it's chemistry the not to say that there is an art artistry and nuance to baking but a lot of like dinner cooking.

447
00:30:11,375 --> 00:30:19,108
Rym: you can kind of just fudge it like you learn some fundamentals and you can kind of just wing recipes and Even if you're not super precise things kind of just work.

448
00:30:19,148 --> 00:30:19,390
Rym: fine.

449
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:34,149
Rym: But at the same time if you if someone just reads our recipe to cook a complex like regular dish But isn't like a really good cook and like doesn't know all these things that the rest of you might not say You could follow all the directions and still get something that tastes bad.

450
00:30:34,631 --> 00:30:44,269
Rym: But baking if the ingredients are real like you're not using the wrong ingredients and you follow the directions Precisely on a well-known recipe it will just work

451
00:30:45,131 --> 00:30:51,378
Scott: Right, so like you're cooking, you know, you'll see a lot of cooks will have to like add some salt taste it Yeah, add some salt taste it.

452
00:30:51,478 --> 00:30:52,623
Scott: Okay, it's got enough salt.

453
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,150
Scott: How do you even know there's enough salt baking?

454
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:55,194
Scott: You know taste it.

455
00:30:55,335 --> 00:30:59,858
Scott: you're gonna get diseases if you taste that raw flour, okay You can't you know tasting the baking right?

456
00:30:59,898 --> 00:31:02,870
Scott: You're doing a whole bunch of stuff and then you taste it when it's done.

457
00:31:03,011 --> 00:31:05,190
Rym: Yeah, and now they can cookies be like, you know what?

458
00:31:05,331 --> 00:31:10,155
Rym: I'll just put in a little more baking soda give it a little pop like no You know

459
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:14,827
Scott: if you're developing a baking recipe you might be doing that like a little more a little less which

460
00:31:14,887 --> 00:31:17,757
Rym: is not something I am Even remotely interested in doing when

461
00:31:17,777 --> 00:31:21,169
Scott: you're trying to figure out right what you want the final recipe to be.

462
00:31:21,457 --> 00:31:26,619
Scott: Yeah Once you have a recipe already Right you do exactly what that recipe says.

463
00:31:27,141 --> 00:31:33,930
Scott: in order you follow all the instructions and you follow them Exactly as they are written with no changes whatsoever.

464
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:37,019
Rym: It says a quarter teaspoon of cream of tartar.

465
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:40,850
Rym: put exactly one quarter teaspoon of cream of tartar and put it in.

466
00:31:41,291 --> 00:31:44,845
Rym: When it says to put it in don't mix it in early don't mix it in late.

467
00:31:45,146 --> 00:31:46,812
Rym: Don't fuck with it Right.

468
00:31:46,932 --> 00:31:49,840
Scott: And also if you can you want to increase your precision?

469
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:53,470
Scott: I highly recommend scales because you can see like a cup of flour.

470
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:54,295
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

471
00:31:54,315 --> 00:31:56,850
Scott: yeah, there are ways to measure a cup of flour, right?

472
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:57,153
Scott: You don't.

473
00:31:57,193 --> 00:32:04,474
Scott: what you want to do is, you know You get your cup and you sort of you know, make sure the the flour is sort of like, you know Not densely packed.

474
00:32:04,695 --> 00:32:06,140
Scott: you want to sort of be like light and fluffy.

475
00:32:06,461 --> 00:32:17,929
Scott: you can even use a flour sifter To sort of work some air into the flour to fluff it up if it's all dense And then measure the one cup of flour and you'll get a better more precise one cup.

476
00:32:19,311 --> 00:32:33,926
Scott: But really if you have a scale you want to find recipes that say this many grams Right, and then you can get exactly the right amounts and your recipe is going to come out much more Exactly like what it looks like in the.

477
00:32:33,946 --> 00:32:35,815
Scott: you know the picture in the book

478
00:32:36,196 --> 00:32:48,466
Rym: and I guess because this is the how to not suck episode the main advice I have for all of You is baking is a great thing to get into Especially during the current global pandemic because it's hard to get fresh bread and things for obvious reasons.

479
00:32:48,807 --> 00:32:50,070
Rym: You can just make your own.

480
00:32:50,975 --> 00:32:52,605
Scott: The other thing is that it's not just weighing.

481
00:32:52,746 --> 00:32:54,797
Scott: other tricks You can do to be more precise.

482
00:32:54,897 --> 00:32:59,738
Scott: and the baking is you know, you mix something in a bowl Scrape down the sides of the bowl.

483
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:02,930
Scott: that's ingredient you have there right on the sides of the bowl.

484
00:33:03,312 --> 00:33:07,534
Scott: You don't want to lose that and just right be being lazy You also.

485
00:33:07,554 --> 00:33:23,530
Scott: it's not just the precision of the ingredients and the order of operations and timings It's also the temperature and the humidity if your oven is Inconsistent nothing you do before like to the recipe will solve that problem.

486
00:33:24,052 --> 00:33:26,199
Scott: You need to get a thermometer that goes in the oven.

487
00:33:26,219 --> 00:33:32,102
Scott: that is not the thermometer that's part of the oven unless you have extremely Fancy oven right and that way you can check.

488
00:33:32,202 --> 00:33:34,010
Scott: even people with extremely fancy ovens do this.

489
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:39,758
Scott: Anyway, yeah so that you can see the true temperature in the oven With that little thermometer I have.

490
00:33:39,778 --> 00:33:58,411
Scott: they're very cheap and inexpensive oven thermometers But also the temperature in the space you're in based on what you're baking The humidity in your apartment or the temperature in your apartment or also the altitude If you're in Colorado or something, right all of those things can mess with your chemistry Even

491
00:33:58,452 --> 00:34:07,354
Rym: if you're doing like baby for babies first bacon where you're buying a mix and just kind of throwing it together where the mix Did all the precision work for you notice how it always says on the back Here's the directions.

492
00:34:07,775 --> 00:34:11,790
Rym: unless you're at high altitude then do these alternate directions, right?

493
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:14,379
Scott: Also, you might even have to depending on what you're making.

494
00:34:14,478 --> 00:34:17,330
Scott: things might affect it like the water that comes out of your tap.

495
00:34:18,831 --> 00:34:27,518
Scott: I've heard of things like yeah, you know, the water we have here is potable, but it contains something that you know messes with your Cook at baking that happens.

496
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:29,909
Scott: for beer brew go to the grocery store, right?

497
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:32,501
Scott: They go to the grocery store and they buy a distilled water in a jug.

498
00:34:32,621 --> 00:34:41,869
Rym: like remember when Pete way back Our friend was making some beer and it it tasted Exactly the way you would imagine a band-aid would taste if you ate it.

499
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:49,250
Rym: Yeah, and it turned out it was because of some radicals in the water because of the nature of the water supply he was using.

500
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:50,373
Scott: Right.

501
00:34:50,393 --> 00:34:52,103
Scott: So now the next thing you got to worry about is you're good.

502
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:52,989
Scott: You got the instructions.

503
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:54,938
Scott: You're gonna follow them precisely right?

504
00:34:54,958 --> 00:34:57,368
Scott: He needs the good tools, right?

505
00:34:57,388 --> 00:35:01,807
Scott: Yeah You know, you don't need like, you know, the tools aren't gonna make a big difference, right?

506
00:35:01,847 --> 00:35:02,490
Scott: It's sort of like golf.

507
00:35:02,631 --> 00:35:06,850
Scott: It's like yeah, you can have the Tiger Woods golf clubs and you could give Tiger Woods some shitty golf clubs.

508
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:08,110
Scott: You'll still kick your ass, right?

509
00:35:09,155 --> 00:35:14,420
Rym: Just make your life easier like they're not like you can get by with shittier tools But you'll just be happier if you have better exactly.

510
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,550
Scott: I made cookies and things my whole life.

511
00:35:16,751 --> 00:35:24,869
Scott: I would just take a metal bowl a cheap metal bowl and I would mix using a big like a Tablespoon like the kind you would eat soup with not even a special mixing spoon.

512
00:35:25,252 --> 00:35:26,941
Rym: Oh, whatever kids like watching The Simpsons.

513
00:35:26,982 --> 00:35:30,510
Rym: my parents every time they were baking They would grab one of us kids.

514
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:34,890
Rym: Sometimes both of us hand us a bowl and a spoon and make us sit there and just mix while we're watching TV.

515
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:37,458
Scott: Yeah, and it's like I would just mix with.

516
00:35:37,598 --> 00:35:43,134
Scott: you know, whatever we had and it'll totally work, yeah, it doesn't matter too much But there are.

517
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:47,088
Scott: sometimes a tool will drastically make your life easier, right?

518
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:54,390
Scott: So some of the essential tools that you're gonna want for baking almost anything right is the stand mixer.

519
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:56,342
Rym: Oh my god, our French is not.

520
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,510
Rym: gave us a stand mixer.

521
00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:00,701
Rym: Yeah, I wish I'd bought one of those before earlier.

522
00:36:00,721 --> 00:36:02,848
Scott: the stand mixer is about.

523
00:36:03,109 --> 00:36:06,740
Scott: it's not Just about saving yourself the arm effort of mixing.

524
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:10,050
Scott: it saves so much time, right?

525
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:12,329
Scott: Oh, you don't realize how much time it saves.

526
00:36:12,511 --> 00:36:13,334
Scott: It's like before.

527
00:36:13,414 --> 00:36:18,235
Scott: I would mix a batch of cookies and I'd sit there mixing for like several minutes And it would take a while.

528
00:36:18,295 --> 00:36:21,749
Scott: like making cookies would be like, you know, a many hour thing.

529
00:36:21,789 --> 00:36:24,161
Scott: now It's like making cookies takes like no time at all.

530
00:36:24,181 --> 00:36:24,864
Scott: It's like oh it's done.

531
00:36:24,924 --> 00:36:30,370
Rym: I get all the ingredients in the mixer It's going I turn around to do other prep and then everything's ready and they go straight into the oven.

532
00:36:31,333 --> 00:36:32,120
Scott: It's super.

533
00:36:32,443 --> 00:36:33,270
Scott: it's about efficiency.

534
00:36:34,251 --> 00:36:39,310
Scott: You're also probably gonna want like based on what you're baking if you need a whisk, right?

535
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:44,930
Scott: You're gonna want like a whisk that is like the right strength and size for what you're doing.

536
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:50,008
Scott: Yeah, right, especially if you have to use a technique like say whipping cream into a meringue or something.

537
00:36:50,069 --> 00:36:54,830
Scott: Hey You know, sometimes you can do it in the stand mixer with the whisk attachment.

538
00:36:55,131 --> 00:37:01,321
Scott: Yeah, but if you're doing it by hand in the bowl, which you might do for reasons, you know If you got a crappy whisk, it's it might.

539
00:37:01,361 --> 00:37:07,070
Scott: you might have a lot of trouble doing it Where if you have a better whisk, it's like oh look it whipped right because I got a high-quality whisk.

540
00:37:07,091 --> 00:37:15,099
Rym: Yep Make sure you've got all the things that a lot of younger people out of college like they were in your house when you live With your family, but you never thought to buy them.

541
00:37:15,481 --> 00:37:17,690
Rym: get those rubber spatula scrapers.

542
00:37:18,731 --> 00:37:21,980
Rym: Yeah, get like several of those of varying sizes.

543
00:37:22,421 --> 00:37:25,550
Scott: You're also probably gonna want like like a metal scraper.

544
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:29,270
Scott: It's usually it's like just like it's like a metal rectangle with a handle on it.

545
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:34,850
Scott: Yep, right that you can use to like cut dough right and also scrape things off the counter.

546
00:37:35,131 --> 00:37:38,569
Rym: They're also just generally useful for like all sorts of cooking like when you don't use it.

547
00:37:39,695 --> 00:37:42,357
Scott: Yeah, it's a very it's a very good Cooking tool.

548
00:37:42,377 --> 00:37:44,370
Scott: also a rolling pin is gonna be important.

549
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:48,889
Rym: Yep, get get a like a real like stone looking rolling pin.

550
00:37:49,451 --> 00:37:50,094
Scott: Well the did so.

551
00:37:50,114 --> 00:37:53,270
Scott: the stone and the wood rolling pins actually have different uses not true?

552
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:57,329
Scott: Sometimes you might be doing something like rolling out.

553
00:37:58,611 --> 00:38:00,015
Scott: Maybe you're laminating some dough.

554
00:38:00,035 --> 00:38:11,930
Scott: It's a laminate, so I was gonna talk about this also, but there's certain baking techniques you have to learn Right and that this is where like you know there is maybe some skill and practice, but it doesn't matter too much, right?

555
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:27,549
Scott: so laminating is like an example of a skill where you're basically taking butter and dough and Folding it and rolling it fold roll fold roll to create layers And that's why when you like open up a croissant you see like these layers of flakiness Is because they laminated it so many times.

556
00:38:29,153 --> 00:38:36,730
Scott: So that's like a skill that you can build is is Laminating but like if you try to make a croissant, and you sort of suck at laminating you'll still get a croissant.

557
00:38:36,911 --> 00:38:38,903
Scott: It's not like if you follow the instructions.

558
00:38:38,923 --> 00:38:39,970
Scott: You're still gonna get a croissant.

559
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:43,462
Scott: It's just like the beauty of the croissant might be lessened right?

560
00:38:43,482 --> 00:38:43,783
Scott: yeah, it's.

561
00:38:43,944 --> 00:38:47,760
Scott: it's flakiness might not be as Amazing and perfect looking.

562
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,371
Rym: it might look sort of junkie Do is?

563
00:38:49,611 --> 00:39:00,388
Rym: the progression should be make basic stuff first and just like make sure the things you're making taste good And then increase the complexity of what even the ugly croissant is still gonna taste delicious as long as you did it.

564
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,411
Scott: other parts Right.

565
00:39:01,511 --> 00:39:02,455
Scott: it's just your skill on.

566
00:39:02,475 --> 00:39:04,261
Scott: the technique is contributing to like.

567
00:39:04,321 --> 00:39:10,650
Scott: the is for taking you from like you know Delicious to like excellent you know professional level yeah.

568
00:39:11,392 --> 00:39:22,829
Rym: But even with just like basic stuff like how to not suck make like the simplest bread the simplest sugar cookie like make really really Simple stuff first and you'll learn all the basic techniques really quick because they're not hard.

569
00:39:23,331 --> 00:39:28,690
Scott: Yeah, making the fancy things are just you know the same as making the simple things only with extra ingredients.

570
00:39:29,758 --> 00:39:33,360
Rym: You know JB in the livestream pointed out something a very specific tool to get.

571
00:39:33,741 --> 00:39:36,631
Rym: have more than one set of all your measuring spoons and Cups.

572
00:39:36,651 --> 00:39:44,969
Rym: a lot of people have just one measuring cup of every size and one measuring spoon of every size That gets old real quick unless you only bake like once a week.

573
00:39:45,775 --> 00:39:47,186
Scott: You also want to get like a lot of?

574
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:55,190
Scott: Right of various sizes, and then we want to measure all your ingredients in advance into the bowls and then start baking.

575
00:39:55,270 --> 00:40:04,199
Scott: It's like okay combine this into that and this into that and this into that rather than measure add measure add measure add because now Things are mixing while you're measuring, and it's like

576
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:13,633
Rym: oh, no you're in a hurry sometimes the rest of you'll be like while It's mixing slowly introduce ingredient wise you've got to be ready to introduce it at that point or you're gonna Have a problem.

577
00:40:14,135 --> 00:40:16,325
Scott: yeah, I mean, that's just a death general for all cooking though.

578
00:40:16,345 --> 00:40:18,875
Scott: Not just baking true But yeah the point.

579
00:40:18,895 --> 00:40:27,345
Scott: I was talking about laminating because if you have a stone Rolling pin that is great because when you're laminating you want to keep it cold right.

580
00:40:27,385 --> 00:40:28,589
Scott: you don't want that butter to melt.

581
00:40:28,669 --> 00:40:30,074
Scott: you want That solid butter to be.

582
00:40:30,295 --> 00:40:40,509
Scott: you know the cold butter to be folded right and the wooden rolling pin Would not stay as cold right and you might end up You know melting your butter and not getting as good.

583
00:40:41,292 --> 00:40:49,633
Rym: I guess what I would say is you probably want one good stone rolling pin like a traditional looking one like the one you see In old movies where someone's like menacing someone with them And then I

584
00:40:49,734 --> 00:40:50,457
Scott: don't ever like one

585
00:40:50,638 --> 00:40:54,169
Rym: and then have like a wooden rolling like the rolling pin That's the longer skinnier one.

586
00:40:54,873 --> 00:41:00,880
Scott: Yeah, I have one that's sort of like a weird shape where it's sort of like looks like a club You're gonna hit someone with but it's sort of fatter in the middle.

587
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,025
Scott: It's fine.

588
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:07,991
Scott: Whatever yeah Yeah, the high quality tools will make your life Easier.

589
00:41:08,292 --> 00:41:17,905
Scott: you're also gonna want like you know that like I said the measuring devices the scales the instant read thermometer all these you know The oven thermometer these sorts of things yeah,

590
00:41:17,925 --> 00:41:25,720
Rym: which which leads to Figure out the biases of your oven like doesn't run hot or cold And then you can use that just to make your life easier.

591
00:41:25,821 --> 00:41:27,710
Scott: like so I found out that my I moved recently.

592
00:41:27,851 --> 00:41:32,457
Scott: I found out that the oven because I have the thermometer I've had it for a long time was going cold.

593
00:41:32,959 --> 00:41:34,805
Scott: so I the oven actually has a setting.

594
00:41:34,845 --> 00:41:37,154
Scott: I looked up in the manual I could Adjust the oven.

595
00:41:37,174 --> 00:41:40,709
Scott: so I adjusted the oven to plus 15. so now the oven runs.

596
00:41:41,412 --> 00:41:46,250
Scott: You know the oven's internal thermometer is like oh I was off by 15 degrees and now it's correct not bad.

597
00:41:46,912 --> 00:41:49,182
Scott: So you know you can adjust that kind of shit on your oven.

598
00:41:49,222 --> 00:41:50,990
Scott: get the manual for the oven and check it out.

599
00:41:51,892 --> 00:41:56,459
Scott: Yeah, so we were talking about getting better equipment Obviously getting better ingredients.

600
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:58,189
Scott: I don't know how much needs to be said about that.

601
00:41:58,290 --> 00:41:59,675
Rym: Yeah, but one but the nuance there.

602
00:41:59,977 --> 00:42:10,190
Rym: learn that there are ingredients that people don't realize are distinct And if you start baking you have to not mix them up like baking soda and baking powder are two different things.

603
00:42:10,712 --> 00:42:11,918
Scott: Oh, yeah, they're not even remotely.

604
00:42:11,958 --> 00:42:16,639
Rym: the red flower and all-purpose flour are very similar but they are not the same right.

605
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:20,595
Scott: the bread flour has a lot more gluten than the All-purpose flour.

606
00:42:21,036 --> 00:42:23,825
Scott: so you know some people can't eat gluten these days.

607
00:42:23,845 --> 00:42:24,829
Scott: It's a hot topic right?

608
00:42:24,849 --> 00:42:33,370
Scott: yeah The gluten is basically like stretchy goop right that creates like the the structure of the dough.

609
00:42:33,673 --> 00:42:37,850
Scott: Right with its with its right Form I guess right it's like glue.

610
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:44,891
Scott: So if you know you get it wet and it starts to activate right and then you it sort of holds the shape of the dough Together.

611
00:42:44,951 --> 00:42:52,070
Scott: so when your dough is rising the gluten the strength of the structure that you have made is holding the gases in the dough.

612
00:42:52,431 --> 00:42:53,033
Scott: Mmm, right.

613
00:42:53,334 --> 00:42:59,916
Scott: so if your structure is too weak the gas will get out and your bread will be Right all flat.

614
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:08,850
Scott: if the structure is too strong It can't really be too strong, but I guess if it's too strong you would need even more gas to stretch the dough out.

615
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:14,370
Scott: But that's just fine because you can just wait longer for more gas to form which is good because then more flavor develops.

616
00:43:14,834 --> 00:43:16,290
Scott: So it's like a gluten can't be too strong.

617
00:43:16,731 --> 00:43:21,928
Scott: But if the if a different kind of flour doesn't have as much gluten you can't get that added strength.

618
00:43:22,229 --> 00:43:25,135
Scott: Yeah So yeah, that's the other thing.

619
00:43:25,175 --> 00:43:32,699
Scott: so you know most baking things out there cookies cakes all this sort of stuff Do not involve yeast right.

620
00:43:33,141 --> 00:43:34,306
Scott: there's no yeast going on.

621
00:43:34,367 --> 00:43:35,110
Scott: It's not alive.

622
00:43:35,471 --> 00:43:40,125
Rym: Yeah, so you know sort of like baking soda thing some sort of acid like.

623
00:43:40,165 --> 00:43:41,870
Rym: there's different ways to make that happen.

624
00:43:42,031 --> 00:43:48,070
Scott: You mix that you take the dry ingredients you take the wet you mix in the wet ingredient Oh the dry into the wet and you're right, whatever.

625
00:43:48,872 --> 00:44:05,509
Scott: but once you get a yeast into the picture because you're making a bread or a yeasted donut or You know anything with yeast involved because you're getting that rising action and also that sort of you know lactic Alcohol fermented kind of flavor sourness in there as well.

626
00:44:06,534 --> 00:44:09,264
Scott: Now you're working with something that's alive right.

627
00:44:09,304 --> 00:44:10,529
Scott: yeast is a living thing.

628
00:44:11,653 --> 00:44:13,238
Scott: So it's very temperamental right.

629
00:44:13,298 --> 00:44:29,510
Scott: and now those things I was talking about before the temperature in your room The humidity in your apartment the time that you wait for it to rise Yeah The the structure of the glutens all that stuff suddenly matters way more once yeast is in the picture.

630
00:44:30,093 --> 00:44:32,968
Scott: Anything with yeast is harder than something that is not yeast.

631
00:44:33,189 --> 00:44:57,748
Rym: Yep That's why I'd recommend if you've never baked before Like maybe even just buy one of those packets of the grocery store Just make it first just to get familiar with like kitchen stuff Like some of you might be fresh out of college and not know how to do anything But make like cookies first because cookies especially simple cookies like a sugar cookie It's kind of hard like even if you mess up the recipe at multiple steps along the way, they'll still turn out.

632
00:44:57,849 --> 00:45:00,878
Scott: Okay Like the other thing with right.

633
00:45:01,099 --> 00:45:03,290
Scott: so when it comes to yeast there's three kinds.

634
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:06,170
Scott: There's three major kinds of yeast that you're gonna find in your life.

635
00:45:07,472 --> 00:45:11,527
Scott: The one you've probably seen the most is the active dry yeast that comes in little paper packet.

636
00:45:11,668 --> 00:45:12,110
Scott: Yeah, right.

637
00:45:12,593 --> 00:45:14,689
Scott: Then there's the instant yeast which is what I use.

638
00:45:15,911 --> 00:45:22,269
Scott: And then there's the fresh yeast which is sort of it feels like clay or like a putty of some kind, right?

639
00:45:23,174 --> 00:45:31,090
Scott: so the fresh yeast Is like actually pretty fancy and good but there's not a lot of like yeast in it.

640
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:33,568
Scott: There's a lot of like cakey stuff right in there.

641
00:45:34,011 --> 00:45:45,850
Scott: So you sort of sometimes need to use more of it than you need to use with the other yeasts And also it doesn't stay good for very long Right, so you have to put it in the fridge and use it quickly, right?

642
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:48,005
Scott: Which is why they sell it in very small amounts.

643
00:45:48,065 --> 00:45:50,256
Scott: the fresh yeast It's also the hardest to use.

644
00:45:50,316 --> 00:45:55,554
Scott: so I wouldn't use the fresh yeast unless you're like pro and you know what you're doing And it calls for it.

645
00:45:55,594 --> 00:46:00,430
Scott: Right the instant yeast is like the most powerful yeast, right?

646
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:05,647
Scott: It's like these really fine dry little granules of yeast and 100% of them are alive.

647
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:06,952
Scott: They're all.

648
00:46:07,032 --> 00:46:08,538
Scott: every yeast in there is a living yeast.

649
00:46:08,899 --> 00:46:09,843
Scott: That's why it's instant yeast.

650
00:46:09,883 --> 00:46:10,787
Scott: It's like ready to go, right?

651
00:46:12,512 --> 00:46:14,828
Scott: But it only lasts like so long.

652
00:46:15,572 --> 00:46:23,190
Scott: So you got like freeze it or put it in the fridge because like they'll they're all alive at the start But then they'll all die and they won't work anymore.

653
00:46:24,892 --> 00:46:30,820
Scott: So if your recipe is calling for the active dry yeast You want to use less.

654
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:32,530
Scott: you can look up online conversions.

655
00:46:32,911 --> 00:46:37,022
Scott: You're gonna be using less instant yeast if you use instant yeast because it's stronger, right?

656
00:46:37,623 --> 00:46:43,919
Scott: The active dry yeast is more like Preserved kind of yeast but only like.

657
00:46:43,959 --> 00:46:48,090
Scott: some percentage of the yeasts in there are alive and the other ones have died, right?

658
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:50,821
Scott: Because I guess they've been dried out or whatever.

659
00:46:50,881 --> 00:46:52,310
Scott: I don't know that all those details.

660
00:46:53,251 --> 00:46:57,990
Scott: I just know that in the active dry yeast less of the yeasts that are in the package are actually living.

661
00:46:59,372 --> 00:47:05,306
Scott: So that's why a lot of times and they're sort of sleeping right where the instant yeast They're all alive and ready to go the active dry yeast.

662
00:47:05,406 --> 00:47:05,970
Scott: They're sleeping.

663
00:47:06,352 --> 00:47:18,410
Scott: So a lot of the active dry yeast recipes you have to wake them up first and like some water Right or something like that and then use them And you'll be using more of that yeast because like I said some of it is dead.

664
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:30,850
Scott: So you need to use more to get the same number of live yeasts If you get fancy down the road You might like be cultivating and maintaining like specific yeast strains that do particular things that you care about.

665
00:47:31,172 --> 00:47:33,650
Rym: But I doubt many of you will get to that level of baking.

666
00:47:34,592 --> 00:47:40,450
Scott: But well people go to the people do the sourdough starter and yeah, the thing with the sourdough starter is it tastes great.

667
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:51,484
Scott: It's really good to have this, you know living sort of pet you have that you can add to recipes, you know It's like this ingredient that never runs out And you can use it for all kinds of great stuff.

668
00:47:51,524 --> 00:47:52,310
Scott: It tastes amazing.

669
00:47:52,893 --> 00:47:54,259
Scott: You don't need to buy yeast anymore.

670
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:54,741
Scott: Right?

671
00:47:54,782 --> 00:47:57,433
Scott: The problem is is the sourdough starter Like I said is a pet.

672
00:47:57,594 --> 00:47:58,537
Scott: you have to keep feeding it.

673
00:47:58,998 --> 00:48:08,950
Scott: All right, so if you're feeding it you either have to a Keep feeding it flour all the time and then discard a whole bunch of it.

674
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:09,656
Scott: So it's like you go.

675
00:48:09,717 --> 00:48:17,353
Scott: you take it you throw out most of it Then you add a bunch of flour and now it eats the new flour you've added and it stays alive For a longer period.

676
00:48:17,433 --> 00:48:20,261
Scott: yeah, some people feed like once or twice a day, right?

677
00:48:20,702 --> 00:48:28,390
Scott: So if you're doing this sourdough starter It's like man, you're going through a lot of flour right discarding possibly some of it.

678
00:48:28,794 --> 00:48:33,780
Scott: And if you're not discarding it, man You are baking a lot of things that include that sourdough starter.

679
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:37,410
Scott: discard right like there's so many recipes out there, right?

680
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:43,256
Scott: but it's like are you really gonna eat sourdough pancakes every morning and Make sourdough bread every night?

681
00:48:43,757 --> 00:48:48,813
Scott: and it's like you'll be buried in bread and you'll be going through so much more flour because you're constantly Baking.

682
00:48:48,853 --> 00:48:50,099
Scott: right the recipes aren't like.

683
00:48:50,721 --> 00:48:52,510
Scott: oh, yeah, just take sourdough starter and bake it.

684
00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:53,333
Scott: The recipe is like.

685
00:48:53,353 --> 00:48:57,290
Scott: yes sourdough starter goes in to your normal baking as an ingredient.

686
00:48:57,390 --> 00:48:59,338
Scott: You still you know, you bake that bread at night.

687
00:48:59,659 --> 00:49:02,350
Scott: sourdough bread isn't just sourdough starter plus fire.

688
00:49:02,571 --> 00:49:04,858
Scott: Yeah, sourdough starter a little bit.

689
00:49:05,239 --> 00:49:07,646
Rym: Don't just put your sourdough starter in the right.

690
00:49:07,706 --> 00:49:08,910
Rym: That's not just starter.

691
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:10,458
Scott: It's like to make a sourdough bread.

692
00:49:10,538 --> 00:49:17,050
Scott: you make you take a bunch of flour water salt And then instead of adding yeast you put in a little bit of sourdough starter.

693
00:49:17,672 --> 00:49:18,897
Scott: Right, and it's like.

694
00:49:18,977 --> 00:49:23,855
Scott: so if you're baking us if you want your sourdough starter to not get thrown out You're baking a bread every night.

695
00:49:23,875 --> 00:49:28,710
Scott: Just using flour for bread every night and flour to keep feeding the starter.

696
00:49:29,051 --> 00:49:30,155
Scott: So that's the reason I've never done.

697
00:49:30,195 --> 00:49:34,329
Scott: that is just because I had to buy so much flour go through so much flour bake.

698
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:40,570
Scott: all Right, it's good for retired people who are gonna be playing Pendragon and have people over constantly.

699
00:49:41,215 --> 00:49:45,658
Rym: So I did see on the Wikipedia page There's actually a a formal definition of.

700
00:49:45,698 --> 00:49:49,029
Rym: there are 11 things that must occur for something to be considered baking.

701
00:49:50,015 --> 00:49:51,689
Scott: Mmm, interesting a fat smell.

702
00:49:53,033 --> 00:49:59,065
Rym: Okay gases form and expand Microorganisms die, you know what they used to still be alive when you eat your bread.

703
00:49:59,166 --> 00:50:00,150
Scott: No, it dies in the fire.

704
00:50:00,371 --> 00:50:03,339
Rym: Yep, sugar dissolves any egg melt or gluten.

705
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:11,046
Rym: proteins coagulate starches gelatinize or solidify Liquids evaporate the mayard browning occurs on the crust.

706
00:50:11,086 --> 00:50:13,792
Rym: if there is a crust Enzymes are denatured.

707
00:50:14,693 --> 00:50:15,895
Rym: the nutrient changes.

708
00:50:15,915 --> 00:50:16,956
Rym: There's a whole section.

709
00:50:16,976 --> 00:50:19,640
Rym: I'm not going to read about what that means and the pectin breaks down.

710
00:50:21,292 --> 00:50:26,189
Rym: So those are the 11 events that according to this must occur concurrently during baking.

711
00:50:26,994 --> 00:50:29,269
Scott: What if you're baking doesn't do all of those things?

712
00:50:30,052 --> 00:50:33,845
Rym: Then I guess like it seems like it's still baking.

713
00:50:33,865 --> 00:50:35,250
Rym: I'm just skimming through this article.

714
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:36,917
Rym: I'm just looking for a pedantic argument.

715
00:50:36,937 --> 00:50:39,467
Scott: I feel like any one of those would make something baking.

716
00:50:39,829 --> 00:50:51,761
Rym: Yeah It seems like the real definition is around if those things occur as part of the cooking with grains And they could not occur at room temperature Mm-hmm.

717
00:50:52,451 --> 00:51:04,712
Scott: Anyway, yeah the final thing about baking is that you know all these things we talk about like precision and following instructions and all That stuff that is just to get you from ingredients to good tasting food Right.

718
00:51:05,133 --> 00:51:11,210
Scott: the final part of baking that you can optionally do is the arts and crafts mode.

719
00:51:11,431 --> 00:51:15,928
Scott: Yeah, it's like you can make a delicious ass ugly cake and it will be fucking delicious.

720
00:51:15,948 --> 00:51:22,432
Scott: my go-to I like a lumpy cookie, but to make a beautiful cake right now It's like okay.

721
00:51:22,473 --> 00:51:23,577
Scott: I've prepared this frosting.

722
00:51:23,617 --> 00:51:24,882
Scott: I've prepared this cake batter.

723
00:51:24,942 --> 00:51:25,906
Scott: I baked cakes.

724
00:51:26,388 --> 00:51:28,644
Scott: right now I have to construct a cake right.

725
00:51:29,007 --> 00:51:33,430
Scott: it's like well You can just take the cake slap the frosting on and it'll taste fine.

726
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:36,038
Rym: That's my go-to cuz I've tried to get a taste before.

727
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:37,743
Scott: it's not gonna taste better.

728
00:51:37,903 --> 00:51:45,679
Scott: if you put the frosting on artfully It doesn't increase the flavor But it's definitely a part of baking as a hobby.

729
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:46,802
Scott: is arts and crafts right?

730
00:51:47,043 --> 00:51:49,209
Scott: cake decorating cookie decorating?

731
00:51:49,972 --> 00:51:56,888
Scott: There are some baking things like royal icing that taste awful, but you use them for decorating or Right all this sorts of stuff

732
00:51:57,231 --> 00:52:05,662
Rym: We used to kind of often as kids like we had all the piping stuff to like Decorate sugar cookies and cakes and we were all kind of cookie

733
00:52:05,682 --> 00:52:07,868
Scott: getting cookie cutters into different shapes.

734
00:52:08,229 --> 00:52:30,410
Scott: Yeah You know rolling things out right into like spiral shapes doing like some checkerboard cookie Right, you know like this is these extra techniques and steps you can do to beautify the the foods that you're making without necessarily Increasing the flavor or nutrition or edibleness in any way, right?

735
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:32,096
Rym: I guess you got to figure out your line between.

736
00:52:32,116 --> 00:52:34,626
Rym: is your goal to make this a hobby to make food?

737
00:52:35,088 --> 00:52:36,254
Rym: is your goal just To make food?

738
00:52:36,274 --> 00:52:38,730
Rym: or is your goal to make this a full-on hobby, right?

739
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:45,985
Scott: So I think kind of like that where it's sort of optional right where it's like some hobbies It's like yeah, you got a you know, if I look at say photography, right?

740
00:52:46,005 --> 00:52:47,050
Scott: It's like I take photos.

741
00:52:47,431 --> 00:52:52,150
Scott: Well, if I don't like doing the Photoshop part, which I don't yeah, my photos sort of don't get out there.

742
00:52:53,390 --> 00:53:02,943
Scott: Right, neither one of them are flicker in a while Right, but with baking it's like yeah, you can do the baking part And if you're not into the arts and crafts part, you don't have to do it.

743
00:53:03,004 --> 00:53:04,150
Scott: people still gonna eat the food.

744
00:53:04,391 --> 00:53:05,880
Rym: Yeah, I will never turn.

745
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:17,590
Scott: it's not this how ugly it is Right, so it's multidisciplinary, but you can ignore One of the disciplines if you only like the arts and crafts and don't like the food part that comes before it.

746
00:53:18,411 --> 00:53:18,792
Scott: Guess what?

747
00:53:18,873 --> 00:53:21,080
Scott: You can just do arts and crafts without food.

748
00:53:21,201 --> 00:53:24,172
Scott: Yep, or find someone else to make the food for you I don't know.

749
00:53:24,212 --> 00:53:29,350
Rym: Yep, or find someone else who wants to eat the food that make it all worthwhile Mm-hmm.

750
00:53:30,193 --> 00:53:34,206
Scott: But yeah arts and crafts is definitely a big aspect of baking.

751
00:53:34,346 --> 00:53:35,450
Scott: that's out there, right?

752
00:53:36,472 --> 00:53:43,196
Scott: You know you can no matter what you're baking candies you could do candy like Sucks, it's super.

753
00:53:43,316 --> 00:53:44,621
Scott: candy making is dangerous.

754
00:53:44,661 --> 00:53:45,323
Scott: You got to do lunch.

755
00:53:45,363 --> 00:53:46,708
Scott: You can do sugar work though.

756
00:53:46,768 --> 00:53:47,270
Scott: You can do.

757
00:53:47,671 --> 00:53:49,276
Scott: No, there's a lot of like.

758
00:53:49,497 --> 00:53:50,681
Rym: this is baking.

759
00:53:51,143 --> 00:54:01,190
Rym: if you mess up and don't follow the procedure Usually all you're gonna do is make something that tastes really bad But with candy you're gonna start a fire or burn yourself most likely or destroy kitchen equipment.

760
00:54:01,692 --> 00:54:07,449
Scott: The point is candy making is an aspect of baking where you can really get very very creative and artsy.

761
00:54:08,692 --> 00:54:14,710
Scott: All sorts of you know things with sugar at different levels, right, you know You cuz cuz you need doing sugar work.

762
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:25,370
Scott: You got everything from like hard candies all the way up to like caramels and everywhere in between, you know, stretchy taffies Right, all that stuff is just cooking sugar to different temperatures, right?

763
00:54:26,050 --> 00:54:27,356
Scott: You've got like tempering chocolate.

764
00:54:27,376 --> 00:54:34,350
Scott: you can temper chocolate which is a sort of a somewhat tricky technique but once you do it, you can like start coating things in chocolate or

765
00:54:35,673 --> 00:54:37,250
Rym: Temper like the same thing you do to a sword

766
00:54:39,132 --> 00:54:48,090
Scott: Sort of yeah, basically tempering chocolate is where you raise it to a temperature You lower it then you raise it again while you're mixing it like crazy and you're very precise about the temperatures.

767
00:54:49,193 --> 00:55:03,710
Scott: You also seed it with chocolate at different stages But regardless the result is you're controlling the temperature of the chocolate to get it to crystallize Into a particular, you know at a molecular level into a particular crystal structure of the chocolate.

768
00:55:03,991 --> 00:55:04,835
Scott: So it's still chocolate.

769
00:55:04,855 --> 00:55:06,100
Scott: It didn't like change its flavor.

770
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:10,250
Rym: Well, just like if you make a sword and temper it It's still just metal, right?

771
00:55:10,370 --> 00:55:33,830
Scott: You just got the sugar like the chocolate molecules to line up in a particular structure so that you get Chocolate that is shiny and hard that snaps like right Whereas you know the same chocolate if you don't get it into that sort of Shape could be bendy or melty or sticky or sort of cloudy looking not nice and shiny Mmm, right.

772
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:39,590
Scott: So if you want to like coat things in chocolate, you kind of need to do tempering, right?

773
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:43,270
Scott: It's like it's like one of those techniques like laminating that you'd have to learn and do.

774
00:55:43,651 --> 00:55:45,257
Scott: Yeah, but it's but it's.

775
00:55:45,357 --> 00:55:49,210
Scott: usually you would only temper chocolate since it doesn't really change the flavor of the chocolate.

776
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:53,802
Scott: It does change the texture which could matter for the eating experience somewhat.

777
00:55:54,323 --> 00:55:56,829
Scott: but most of it is about the the looks right?

778
00:55:58,151 --> 00:56:03,969
Scott: You can just coat something in soft chocolate and how much difference is anyone gonna gonna care really, right?

779
00:56:04,790 --> 00:56:06,750
Scott: Yeah, it's great if you buy a fancy chocolate.

780
00:56:06,872 --> 00:56:17,545
Rym: So, uh The last piece of advice I have for you is when if you can't get a hold of bread flour and you want to make Bread Google for how to just get wheat gluten and mix it into your flour.

781
00:56:17,586 --> 00:56:21,750
Rym: Like there's way yes, but There's ways to fix that problem.

782
00:56:22,131 --> 00:56:23,556
Rym: If you can't get bread flour.

783
00:56:23,737 --> 00:56:27,510
Scott: bread flour is just you know, all-purpose flour is just you know.

784
00:56:27,570 --> 00:56:28,975
Scott: It's just a regular old flour.

785
00:56:28,995 --> 00:56:30,380
Scott: So that's another thing right?

786
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:30,480
Scott: is?

787
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:33,330
Scott: people talk about like, you know white flour and whole wheat flour.

788
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:40,091
Scott: Right, unless you're dealing with like other kinds of flour like, you know almond flour or something Right.

789
00:56:40,653 --> 00:56:42,498
Scott: white flour is also wheat flour.

790
00:56:42,819 --> 00:56:45,426
Scott: Yeah, there's white wheat and whole wheat.

791
00:56:45,767 --> 00:56:46,529
Scott: They're both wheats.

792
00:56:47,254 --> 00:56:48,928
Scott: It's not like white flour isn't wheat?

793
00:56:49,532 --> 00:56:50,980
Scott: Right, it's just old.

794
00:56:51,080 --> 00:57:00,636
Scott: the white flour is only endosperms, I think yeah Yeah, thought the wheat has.

795
00:57:00,656 --> 00:57:04,906
Scott: the wheat kernel has several parts and it goes into the mill right.

796
00:57:04,926 --> 00:57:13,930
Scott: it gets milled at a flour mill and then it gets crushed and They can separate out the different parts of the the wheat right the wheat kernel.

797
00:57:14,291 --> 00:57:17,061
Scott: So the white flour is just endosperms only.

798
00:57:17,081 --> 00:57:21,142
Scott: I think that's the part that's kept in the white flour Whereas the whole wheat flour is.

799
00:57:21,162 --> 00:57:23,336
Scott: they didn't separate it It's just all the flour.

800
00:57:23,517 --> 00:57:26,049
Scott: all the parts of the wheat kernel are still there just crushed up.

801
00:57:27,390 --> 00:57:31,250
Scott: So yeah, don't don't think that white flour is somehow not wheat.

802
00:57:31,818 --> 00:57:32,347
Scott: It's still wheat.

803
00:57:33,092 --> 00:57:38,748
Scott: but all-purpose flour is generally just white wheat flour with a certain level of gluten in it.

804
00:57:39,170 --> 00:57:43,225
Scott: and Bread flour is typically the same thing only with more gluten in it.

805
00:57:43,265 --> 00:57:48,444
Scott: because you're gonna be making bread You need more gluten and whole wheat flour is just the whole wheat.

806
00:57:48,845 --> 00:57:50,250
Scott: We didn't separate out the parts.

807
00:57:51,193 --> 00:57:56,330
Scott: So if you're making like a whole wheat bread very rarely will a whole wheat bread be a hundred percent whole wheat flour.

808
00:57:56,914 --> 00:58:04,270
Scott: usually you'll be doing something like You know white bread flour or 50% whole wheat something like that.

809
00:58:04,270 --> 00:58:06,969
Rym: Yeah, but the recipe you're following will tell you what to use.

810
00:58:07,592 --> 00:58:13,950
Rym: Yes, and if it doesn't specify if a recipe is just like just use flour nine times out of ten all-purpose flour, right?

811
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:17,301
Scott: But like say rye flour, that's a different grain.

812
00:58:17,361 --> 00:58:17,903
Scott: That's not wheat.

813
00:58:18,244 --> 00:58:19,147
Rym: Yeah, it's rye.

814
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:20,070
Scott: rye is not wheat.

815
00:58:20,473 --> 00:58:22,310
Rym: Don't don't make sugar cookies with rye flour.

816
00:58:22,350 --> 00:58:25,289
Rym: It'll do well, right maybe depending on what you want it to do, right?

817
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:27,641
Scott: But it's like if you make a rye bread, well, guess what?

818
00:58:27,702 --> 00:58:28,506
Scott: It's not a wheat bread.

819
00:58:28,566 --> 00:58:29,230
Scott: It's a rye bread.

820
00:58:29,491 --> 00:58:30,234
Scott: What is right?

821
00:58:30,254 --> 00:58:32,744
Rym: cookie with rye flour would taste like you.

822
00:58:33,266 --> 00:58:33,869
Scott: probably not good.

823
00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:38,682
Scott: But Yeah, you know learn about flour.

824
00:58:38,702 --> 00:58:40,530
Rym: Oh, it's the same people make them.

825
00:58:40,873 --> 00:58:48,327
Scott: They don't look if you particularly good though If you can't get bread flour take white all-purpose flour and add some gluten to it.

826
00:58:48,347 --> 00:58:49,170
Scott: You can just get gluten.

827
00:58:50,292 --> 00:58:54,210
Scott: And also just last thing if you're doing some gluten-free bacon, you can't get any gluten in there.

828
00:58:54,632 --> 00:58:56,139
Scott: There's a lot of other things you can do.

829
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:57,204
Scott: most common.

830
00:58:57,285 --> 00:58:58,290
Scott: I see is xanthan gum.

831
00:58:58,611 --> 00:59:02,430
Scott: Yeah, cuz xanthan gum is gummy like gluten, but it's not gluten.

832
00:59:02,531 --> 00:59:04,750
Scott: So it won't get a person sick who has celiac disease.

833
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:13,256
Scott: so you can usually you know take a no gluten flour and you mix in some xanthan gum and To a certain amount and there you go.

834
00:59:13,297 --> 00:59:21,845
Scott: You have some sort of physical structure that can contain gas And you've got you know the rest of the parts of flour right and you're.

835
00:59:22,026 --> 00:59:23,350
Scott: you get some yeasts in there.

836
00:59:23,411 --> 00:59:25,797
Scott: they could eat it and You know make a bread.

837
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:31,664
Rym: Yeah, I think we've gone on long enough And also, I'm actually literally gonna go bake some cookies.

838
00:59:31,845 --> 00:59:34,961
Scott: probably after the show I'm gonna I'm gonna go eat some kind of dinner.

839
00:59:35,022 --> 00:59:38,798
Scott: I guess they'll see what's in the freezer Cuz I just saw the other night.

840
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:46,669
Rym: I made some really like Trust me sugar cookies are like the simplest possible thing you can bake and it's almost impossible to mess them up.

841
00:59:47,191 --> 00:59:48,095
Scott: I forgot to turn on the.

842
00:59:48,175 --> 00:59:54,174
Scott: it's been getting dark while we've been doing the show and I forgot to turn on this light on the stream here That I have.

843
00:59:54,194 --> 00:59:55,962
Scott: I got this light and I didn't even use it.

844
00:59:56,223 --> 00:59:57,630
Rym: Oh, I think I lost Scott on the discord.

845
00:59:58,530 --> 01:00:01,883
Scott: Yeah, I think you did because I bumped something anyway has appeared.

846
01:00:02,445 --> 01:00:03,188
Scott: I did all right.

847
01:00:03,630 --> 01:00:12,460
Rym: Yeah, this has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

848
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:17,300
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

849
01:00:17,581 --> 01:00:19,568
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at front row.

850
01:00:19,608 --> 01:00:22,600
Scott: crew calm for show notes discussion news and more.

851
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:33,816
Rym: Remember GeekNights is not one but four different shows sci-tech Mondays gaming Tuesdays anime comic Wednesdays and indiscriminate Thursdays Night's is distributed under a Creative Commons attribution 3.0 license.

852
01:00:35,081 --> 01:00:38,170
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

853
01:00:38,351 --> 01:00:39,836
Scott: But unlike those other late shows.

854
01:00:39,956 --> 01:00:55,520
Rym: It's actually recorded at night And the patreon patrons for this particular episode of GeekNights is something that I will read as soon as this page loads.

855
01:00:56,981 --> 01:00:59,612
Rym: I've hope you're all enjoying the fact that we got the streams going again.

856
01:01:00,014 --> 01:01:01,400
Rym: We're gonna tweak that pipeline.

857
01:01:01,641 --> 01:01:05,380
Rym: I'm gonna watch the two streams we did and futz around a little bit over the weekend.

858
01:01:05,902 --> 01:01:10,439
Rym: Try out some new hardware and we will be ready to rock with some more stuff.

859
01:01:11,542 --> 01:01:13,214
Rym: Stay tuned for other secret projects.

860
01:01:13,234 --> 01:01:16,285
Rym: We're working on And also stay tuned.

861
01:01:16,305 --> 01:01:23,167
Rym: I think we're gonna try to get a new ten episode done with this new pipeline Before the end of May.

862
01:01:23,247 --> 01:01:25,920
Rym: that might seem like a ways out, but I got some other project to finish first.

863
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,360
Rym: But now is the perfect time to crank our way through the antenna show.
