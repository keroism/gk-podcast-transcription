7
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:40,841
Scott: This is it was a crisis, but it was averted.

8
00:00:40,862 --> 00:00:48,719
Rym: Yeah, this is the one that temporarily This is the one that ends when our boy Diocletian comes in and says oh, yeah.

Scott: Yep.

11
00:00:54,644 --> 00:01:09,789
Rym: Ah commodus, but after Caesar Nero Audius all those Roman emperors, you know, yeah after them I feel like you've heard of a few of the people here if you like started paid attention and AP Western Civ But otherwise, yeah Anthony and Cleopatra way in the back.

18
00:01:41,029 --> 00:01:44,690
Scott: for How many years 15 year we run out of idea?

19
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:51,804
Rym: Yep, because we do not watch anime every single day like we used to yeah, but I play games Every single week.

20
00:01:51,844 --> 00:01:54,050
Rym: Yeah Well, so, you know not done to get in a meta.

21
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,470
Rym: But we go to a lot of gaming cons and a lot of generic nerd cons.

22
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,401
Scott: Going to an anime con wouldn't give me.

23
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:03,710
Scott: I don't watch more anime at an enemy con.

24
00:02:04,131 --> 00:02:05,536
Scott: Give me more Wednesday shows.

25
00:02:05,737 --> 00:02:07,703
Rym: it used to talk about con.

26
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:12,824
Scott: right when I go to a gaming show I play games and then it gives me more Tuesday shows.

27
00:02:12,885 --> 00:02:13,970
Scott: I could go to every I could go.

28
00:02:14,732 --> 00:02:16,918
Rym: We got someone just gave us a really good suggestion.

29
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:19,003
Rym: Yeah tech news roundup.

30
00:02:19,064 --> 00:02:21,350
Scott: No, I gotta wait two more months.

31
00:02:22,731 --> 00:02:24,819
Rym: So in some games roundup is for March.

32
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,766
Rym: Yeah before we get it's coming up.

00:02:27,027 --> 00:02:28,272
Rym: I'm ready You're ready.

34
00:02:28,754 --> 00:02:30,340
Rym: that clock rings once a year.

35
00:02:31,023 --> 00:02:32,750
Rym: I wake up and I'm like, what are we gonna do the Monday show?

36
00:02:33,731 --> 00:02:35,357
Rym: Tech news roundup, is it true?

37
00:02:35,437 --> 00:02:40,782
Rym: and I have to look and double-check the last time we did it and then I say Scott Let's do a tech news roundup and Scott will always say

38
00:02:40,923 --> 00:02:41,385
Scott: so we

39
00:02:41,426 --> 00:02:48,976
Rym: just did one There's no way and then we'll look cuz I deleted the one we just did from the CMS and then we do All right.

40
00:02:49,418 --> 00:02:51,928
Rym: So in some news as you guys know, I still play overwatch.

41
00:02:51,948 --> 00:02:57,800
Rym: like a lot Overwatch is my favorite like, you know You got your games that you play because they're knowing that it.

42
00:02:57,821 --> 00:02:58,885
Scott: when did overwatch come out?

43
00:02:58,905 --> 00:02:59,990
Rym: a few years ago?

44
00:03:00,211 --> 00:03:00,918
Scott: How many years ago?

45
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:06,050
Scott: like three ish Alright, so I mean I played netrunner for X years.

46
00:03:06,211 --> 00:03:09,170
Scott: You seem to just be playing overwatch for about the same number of years.

47
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:18,380
Rym: The thing is overwatch for me is like tribes 2 and weapons factory in that if they were still playable I would probably still be playing.

48
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,767
Scott: Well, I think the difference is is that You know netrunner requires significantly more effort to play.

49
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:26,676
Scott: Yeah Right Whereas overwatch you can just play whenever.

50
00:03:26,776 --> 00:03:32,943
Scott: if I could if there was a way to just played netrunner legit digital not the bullshit Digital and all the fun like you go to a ready room.

51
00:03:32,984 --> 00:03:33,970
Rym: You're like, I want to play.

52
00:03:35,352 --> 00:03:36,656
Scott: There was the fans made one.

53
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:37,780
Scott: I just thought it was garbage.

54
00:03:37,981 --> 00:03:47,630
Rym: Oh, yeah, and they had a good one and that was I mean Yeah, we play tribes - if we get those executable files on the internet and run a complicated and I probably still be playing it.

55
00:03:47,892 --> 00:03:54,410
Rym: So, you know, yep But the holy grail for me, this is not the holy grail for the game industry.

56
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,741
Rym: This is old man Rym and the kind of game.

57
00:03:56,762 --> 00:03:57,264
Rym: He wants that.

58
00:03:57,304 --> 00:04:00,917
Rym: No one else gives a shit about the genre I miss.

59
00:04:01,137 --> 00:04:08,460
Rym: the most of games that I've liked over my life is First-person shooter team-based capture the flag.

60
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:16,260
Rym: Oh, yeah like that that shit just gets me going in a way that is The flag IRL is great fun.

61
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:18,146
Scott: That's why that was what inspired.

62
00:04:18,187 --> 00:04:21,137
Scott: capture the flag in quay Look even like which is just faster.

63
00:04:21,218 --> 00:04:24,130
Scott: capture the flag with rules that are properly enforced on guns.

64
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,437
Rym: It's like even summer camp.

65
00:04:25,457 --> 00:04:31,304
Rym: capture the flag with its vague ass rules Like you don't even have a paintball gun usually still is way fun.

66
00:04:31,444 --> 00:04:34,817
Scott: I always do one thing, you know Is that real?

67
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:38,110
Scott: capture the flag in real life, but you know a million variants?

68
00:04:38,551 --> 00:04:43,796
Scott: But we always played some sort of variant that involved taking prisoners Of course and the what.

69
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:46,204
Scott: the quake ones pretty much never have prisoners.

70
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,528
Scott: you kill someone and they respawn.

71
00:04:47,588 --> 00:04:56,609
Scott: Yep Cool to have some sort of digital capture the flag FPS with the prisoner mechanic really Kill someone they're in a jail.

72
00:04:56,951 --> 00:05:00,789
Scott: So now you're rushing the flag or do you rush the prison to bust everyone out?

73
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:12,229
Rym: so because overwatch is based pretty heavily on games like action quake 2 like it's from that era and In the arcade part of overwatch, they keep making like fun game modes and they try stuff out.

74
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:19,588
Rym: They keep tweaking and re-releasing different versions of capture the flag and when they first tried it didn't work that well.

75
00:05:19,608 --> 00:05:23,649
Rym: for a lot of Reasons, I don't want to turn the whole show into this but they keep tweaking it.

76
00:05:24,512 --> 00:05:29,087
Rym: They made a new tweak real recently and I think they're on to something.

77
00:05:29,107 --> 00:05:29,890
Scott: What did they do?

78
00:05:31,134 --> 00:05:32,278
Rym: They made it faster.

79
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,070
Scott: Okay, like why don't they just make all overwatch faster?

80
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,740
Rym: So all overwatch is already reasonably fast compared to most.

81
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:40,746
Rym: FPS is like today quake too fast.

82
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:49,204
Rym: Nothing's quite too fast it's not fast, but What they did with CTF blitz a new move that's in the arcade like right now.

83
00:05:49,786 --> 00:05:51,250
Rym: They moved the flags closer together.

84
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:53,420
Rym: Whoa, you're like way closer together.

85
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,794
Rym: They put the flags now Where they own.

86
00:05:56,894 --> 00:05:58,720
Rym: in the normal CTF they had previously.

87
00:05:59,262 --> 00:06:01,550
Rym: the flags are kind of far apart in bases like tradition.

88
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,357
Scott: So is it like an icy world kind of feel.

89
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:05,686
Rym: it's more like an icy world kind of feels the.

90
00:06:05,706 --> 00:06:08,232
Scott: really you're just like you just Throw it Bigger.

91
00:06:08,272 --> 00:06:09,076
Rym: so the way it works is.

92
00:06:09,096 --> 00:06:12,070
Rym: you know the old like to fort maps is like the base and the flag room.

93
00:06:12,652 --> 00:06:17,370
Rym: They in regular CTF overwatch if the game is a tie the sudden death.

94
00:06:17,631 --> 00:06:18,516
Rym: It's the same map.

95
00:06:18,798 --> 00:06:20,688
Rym: but the flags are like on the bridge.

96
00:06:20,769 --> 00:06:23,529
Rym: really Yeah, they're like on either side either side of the bridge fucking go.

97
00:06:24,374 --> 00:06:27,230
Rym: They basically put the flags in a situation like that from the start.

98
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,763
Rym: They make you get more captures when you die.

99
00:06:29,783 --> 00:06:33,281
Rym: in normal overwatch There's a long respawn timer before you go back in.

100
00:06:33,322 --> 00:06:36,379
Scott: instant respawn instant respawn But you respawn way in the back.

101
00:06:36,842 --> 00:06:42,590
Rym: you respawn way in the back But you also move faster for like 10 seconds after your spawn.

102
00:06:42,991 --> 00:06:51,366
Rym: So it's like old quake to style CTF where if you kill someone they are instantly Running straight back into the action from spawn screaming.

103
00:06:51,486 --> 00:06:54,250
Rym: Okay They made a bunch of other changes.

104
00:06:54,330 --> 00:07:10,770
Rym: I'm not gonna get into the details of but the end result of these tweaks is it's not perfect yet It still has flaws but from my like fairly like deep it Intuitive and mechanical Understanding of CTF games throughout their history.

105
00:07:11,433 --> 00:07:17,640
Rym: This feels the closest to the feelings of old CTF FPS's from the quake one quake two era of anything.

106
00:07:17,721 --> 00:07:18,845
Rym: anyone's made up to this point?

107
00:07:18,925 --> 00:07:20,130
Scott: still not tribes to know.

108
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:24,423
Rym: Of course, it's not tribes to try to choose the exact opposite flags as far apart.

109
00:07:24,443 --> 00:07:25,305
Rym: Yeah possible.

110
00:07:25,365 --> 00:07:26,910
Scott: All right, my where's the flag?

111
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,236
Scott: Let me use my binoculars.

112
00:07:28,277 --> 00:07:29,282
Scott: Yeah, I seize it.

113
00:07:29,402 --> 00:07:30,830
Rym: Oh you want to get over to the enemy base?

114
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,036
Rym: All right Get someone to spawn a truck.

115
00:07:33,176 --> 00:07:37,310
Scott: you can everybody get into the truck and the game will be over by the time you get there.

116
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:38,482
Scott: You can use your jetpack.

117
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:39,330
Scott: That's pretty reasonable.

118
00:07:40,114 --> 00:07:43,170
Scott: Or you can fly in this fighter jet or take a bike.

119
00:07:43,411 --> 00:07:50,830
Rym: my goal in tribes too often was to be a medium guy and Fucking make my way all the way over to the other side and make a tiny base.

120
00:07:51,251 --> 00:07:52,376
Scott: It's like oh the enemies didn't.

121
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:53,702
Scott: even the map is so big.

122
00:07:53,963 --> 00:07:55,770
Scott: you didn't even see any enemy players.

123
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:58,964
Scott: But you approach the enemy base and died because it has automated defenses.

124
00:07:59,366 --> 00:08:01,509
Scott: Yeah suck They just shoot at you and you die.

125
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:09,588
Rym: So in some other news Rocket League is doing the obvious thing that I was surprised they still support.

126
00:08:09,688 --> 00:08:16,950
Scott: Oh, yeah I mean so Rocket League when it was new Did a great job of supporting all the platforms, right?

127
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:17,995
Scott: It was pretty much on.

128
00:08:18,095 --> 00:08:27,250
Scott: everything is on, you know, PS whatever Xbox PC Even Linux Mac switch is just on everything that could run Rocket League.

129
00:08:27,551 --> 00:08:32,787
Scott: They're like, yes, we will be on every platform and they had crossplay as much as as much as they could.

130
00:08:33,068 --> 00:08:38,337
Scott: they had crossplay I would be on PC and I'd open up Rocket League during the time I played it and lo and behold.

131
00:08:38,398 --> 00:08:40,429
Scott: Oh look this PlayStation people playing against me.

132
00:08:40,491 --> 00:08:42,033
Scott: All right and it was.

133
00:08:42,232 --> 00:08:52,030
Rym: it was like that from the start and I remember people even like making the point and I would kind of argue with Them that yeah, like there's a huge thriving community of Linux and Mac gamers.

134
00:08:52,151 --> 00:08:53,905
Scott: I don't remember anyone saying that but I do.

135
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:58,684
Scott: but you know There are people those people who do right play on Linux and Mac.

136
00:08:58,724 --> 00:09:00,429
Scott: They don't have a lot of games to choose from.

137
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:04,222
Scott: Yeah, so the games that they do play right?

138
00:09:04,282 --> 00:09:06,229
Scott: They will be loud about right?

139
00:09:06,289 --> 00:09:11,680
Scott: Yeah It's like oh my god a game is on my Linux I'm playing it like crazy and that's my game.

140
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,466
Scott: and so think I'm all up in.

141
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:17,382
Scott: so if you're a game developer You're the kind of guy who you play plays games on Linux or Mac.

142
00:09:17,684 --> 00:09:19,069
Scott: You're the kind of person who's loud about it.

143
00:09:19,632 --> 00:09:29,110
Rym: So if you are a game developer and it's a multiplayer game Theoretically by supporting Mac or Linux you'll capture like 90% of that audience, right?

144
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:40,958
Scott: But because rocket League does have so many players that audience of Mac and Linux Rocket League players is still 0.3% of all active rocket League players 0.3%.

145
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:44,990
Scott: so I didn't think it, you know is taking them a lot of effort to support those players.

146
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:50,050
Scott: I cuz it looked to me like they had some sort of really good, you know cross-platform build process.

147
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:54,408
Rym: You know, they were just you know, but they might have just papered over that with developer effort, right?

148
00:09:54,448 --> 00:09:54,830
Scott: Who knows?

149
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:57,499
Scott: But apparently it's taking more than zero effort.

150
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,196
Rym: It's costing them more than zero money and it's worth a zero 0.3 right.

151
00:10:02,236 --> 00:10:02,357
Scott: so?

152
00:10:02,417 --> 00:10:05,590
Scott: and it's not a game where you pay for subscriptions game where you buy it and you're done.

153
00:10:05,851 --> 00:10:08,480
Scott: So they're not making any more money from that.

154
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,290
Scott: It's like how many more people on Mac and Linux are buying rocket League.

155
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:11,913
Scott: They already have it.

156
00:10:12,174 --> 00:10:12,476
Scott: Yep.

157
00:10:12,496 --> 00:10:15,109
Scott: So it's like yeah, we're gonna stop supporting it.

158
00:10:15,571 --> 00:10:23,903
Scott: So you can still play by yourself or locally with your existing rocket League patch Whatever patch that is or use like wine or boot camp or something.

159
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:25,850
Scott: Yeah, a new wine version came out recently.

160
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:26,633
Scott: It's like wine five.

161
00:10:26,653 --> 00:10:27,998
Rym: Wow, and I have not.

162
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:29,002
Rym: I have not used.

163
00:10:29,364 --> 00:10:32,495
Rym: wine is not an emulator since 1990.

164
00:10:32,495 --> 00:10:34,067
Rym: I don't remember when I last used it.

165
00:10:34,349 --> 00:10:38,982
Rym: No 2002 I I was the wine expert at IBM.

166
00:10:39,162 --> 00:10:41,349
Rym: The point is I made old shit working wine that.

167
00:10:42,671 --> 00:10:50,769
Scott: Yeah, you're not gonna be able to play online once the patch goes out or if it went out already Yeah, I'm gonna have to play on Windows or on a PlayStation.

168
00:10:52,955 --> 00:10:58,347
Rym: The only viable gaming platforms are phones slash mobiles of phones and tablets.

169
00:10:58,387 --> 00:10:59,650
Scott: Hey, can you play rocket League in your phone?

170
00:10:59,991 --> 00:11:01,576
Rym: I don't think I'm just like.

171
00:11:01,978 --> 00:11:03,523
Rym: if you want to play games, it's.

172
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:05,410
Rym: there's mobile which includes tablets.

173
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:09,443
Rym: There's the switch, you know consoles switch PlayStation, whatever easy.

174
00:11:09,584 --> 00:11:10,889
Rym: and there's Windows PCs.

175
00:11:11,975 --> 00:11:12,403
Rym: That is it.

176
00:11:13,853 --> 00:11:15,228
Rym: So, uh some other news.

177
00:11:16,971 --> 00:11:22,490
Rym: Pokemon home is not actually technically replacing Pokemon Bank or at least not yet.

178
00:11:22,912 --> 00:11:23,837
Rym: but they announced it.

179
00:11:23,877 --> 00:11:38,190
Rym: they announced all the deal with it and It's interesting because I see like the Twitter Discussion I see about this is like one-third people are like, yes I have a home for all my Pokemon one third of people who were like, but it cost so much money.

180
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,917
Rym: This is bullshit nonsense.

181
00:11:39,957 --> 00:11:41,503
Scott: They charge money from Pokemon Bank.

182
00:11:41,603 --> 00:11:42,909
Scott: Also how do I actually?

183
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:45,882
Scott: yeah I'd only paid for Pokemon Bank at the start.

184
00:11:46,023 --> 00:11:47,510
Scott: It's I'm down and that was it.

185
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:50,461
Scott: So I guess I got the free like whatever the period was.

186
00:11:50,481 --> 00:11:52,889
Scott: Yeah, and then I never paid for it again.

187
00:11:53,652 --> 00:11:58,149
Scott: But I have a Pokemon Bank full of spirit tombs somewhere if I can possibly access it.

188
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:06,414
Rym: So Pokemon Bank was basically the old way to get Pokemon from various Pokemon games into a place that you could then get them Forward right.

189
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:09,970
Scott: So the original Pokemon the very first Pokemon Gameboy cartridge.

190
00:12:10,131 --> 00:12:16,618
Scott: You could move your Pokemon from the original Pokemon red blue Right into Pokemon gold silver.

191
00:12:16,638 --> 00:12:38,570
Scott: and then I don't there was a cut off at some point but for quite a while they had ways for you to use link cables or DS's with you know a GBA cartridge and a DS cartridge and there were ways to Bringing your Pokemon up and up and up, but there was a cutoff and then they started again.

192
00:12:39,112 --> 00:12:50,135
Rym: And I don't think there was a second cut off until the newest switch game Which I believe you can transfer Pokemon from a third gen game to a fourth gen game provided you own an original Ds or DS light.

193
00:12:50,195 --> 00:12:50,617
Rym: All right.

194
00:12:50,758 --> 00:12:52,827
Rym: Yeah, I there seems like there were.

195
00:12:52,868 --> 00:12:53,350
Scott: there were a few.

196
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:59,650
Scott: I think there was a point where you couldn't transfer up anymore, but there was a surprising support for transferring your Pokemon.

197
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:04,070
Rym: You know, you're transferring Pokemon from Gameboy Advance to modern games.

198
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:12,434
Rym: Yeah, I feel like the goal was to get it to the minimum Pokemon game that could connect to Bank And then you were golden, right?

199
00:13:12,454 --> 00:13:14,981
Scott: Yeah Bank was not Pokemon gold golden.

200
00:13:15,001 --> 00:13:20,658
Scott: Just golden Bank was it until the switch came out and So now they're gonna have Pokemon home.

201
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:21,180
Rym: Yep.

202
00:13:21,381 --> 00:13:23,728
Scott: It's just Pokemon Bank on the switch.

203
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:37,290
Rym: now It seems like people who play Pokemon on the switch to use all the online features Or you got to pay for the Pokemon stuff Nintendo online and on top of this they're actually 16 pay 16 bucks a year for Pokemon home.

204
00:13:37,471 --> 00:13:46,030
Rym: So that comes out like 40 bucks a year and it still limits you to 6000 Pokemon which when I looked at this, that's all I need to you folks that is plenty.

205
00:13:46,391 --> 00:13:53,369
Rym: But according to a third of the people I see on Twitter that is to paraphrase Bullshit, that is harmful to me as a person.

206
00:13:54,294 --> 00:13:56,865
Scott: If you're a pokémaniac, you got more than 6,000 Pokemon.

207
00:13:56,906 --> 00:14:06,750
Rym: if you're a pokémaniac I feel like I mean that's already the premium plan If you need more than 6,000 Pokemon, you need help or Nintendo could offer you a like Platinum plan.

208
00:14:08,232 --> 00:14:11,170
Scott: Nintendo does have a history of increasing the numbers over time.

209
00:14:11,352 --> 00:14:25,127
Scott: Yeah example in Mario maker They always have a limit on how many levels you can upload because at the start there's so many players Right and everyone's uploading levels like crazy, but then as players drop off the game They're like, okay anyone who's still playing Mario maker will increase your level.

210
00:14:25,167 --> 00:14:25,710
Scott: upload limit.

211
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,838
Scott: Yeah, they've done it already like two or three times.

212
00:14:28,319 --> 00:14:29,805
Scott: So I feel like for Pokemon home.

213
00:14:29,845 --> 00:14:31,230
Scott: It's gonna be like, okay 6,000.

214
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:32,837
Scott: Yeah, all right, who's still playing Pokemon?

215
00:14:32,837 --> 00:14:33,439
Scott: 10,000?

216
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:36,570
Scott: All right, who's still playing 20,000?

217
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:42,130
Rym: So it looks like if you don't pay you can't take Pokemon from Pokemon Bank and even put them in here.

218
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:45,049
Rym: Ah, and you can have up to 30 Pokemon in their total.

219
00:14:45,531 --> 00:14:46,273
Rym: You can't use any.

220
00:14:46,293 --> 00:14:53,136
Scott: but if you're not if you're not transferring Pokemon from old Pokemon to new What does Pokemon home even do?

221
00:14:53,196 --> 00:14:57,892
Rym: trading with other people who play the switch Pokemon is basically you can just do that with the switch Pokemon.

222
00:14:57,932 --> 00:14:58,957
Scott: why do you need Pokemon home?

223
00:14:59,057 --> 00:15:01,850
Rym: You can't do like the wonder trade that's built into home.

224
00:15:02,191 --> 00:15:08,610
Rym: Okay, they may have rooms or you can just like set up a little carpet and be like I got a Pikachu if anyone wants It okay.

225
00:15:09,694 --> 00:15:12,174
Rym: And they got this judge function Which you won't get to use.

226
00:15:12,435 --> 00:15:14,704
Rym: that will tell you how strong the Pokemon is.

227
00:15:14,764 --> 00:15:18,681
Rym: They added a bunch of features that You need if you're Pokemon, yeah, you.

228
00:15:18,701 --> 00:15:24,525
Rym: basically if you're serious about Pokemon I feel like what you need to do is pay for Pokemon premium.

229
00:15:24,565 --> 00:15:25,690
Rym: paper Pokemon on premium.

230
00:15:26,732 --> 00:15:27,697
Rym: Use the free month.

231
00:15:27,717 --> 00:15:30,530
Rym: They're giving everyone in Pokemon Bank to use Bank.

232
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:33,649
Rym: If you haven't used it before they're gonna give everyone a month free on Pokemon Bank.

233
00:15:34,111 --> 00:15:36,682
Rym: Get every Pokemon you got in the world into Bank.

234
00:15:36,943 --> 00:15:38,750
Rym: get every Pokemon and Bank into home.

235
00:15:39,111 --> 00:15:46,710
Rym: Cancel Bank home forever and then someday they'll be like, I don't know Pokemon But what about it Pokemon glue factor and you move them in?

236
00:15:47,231 --> 00:15:51,385
Scott: So the new Pokemon Pokemon sword shield doesn't support every Pokemon ever.

237
00:15:51,405 --> 00:15:52,810
Rym: so you can put them all.

238
00:15:53,010 --> 00:16:00,470
Scott: Pokemon Bank supports as far as I'm aware every Pokemon every Pokemon except for the ones that are new in sword shield.

239
00:16:00,631 --> 00:16:02,179
Rym: Yep, so, I don't know if you could.

240
00:16:02,219 --> 00:16:04,130
Rym: can you transfer like a missing no or a broken boy?

241
00:16:04,311 --> 00:16:08,530
Scott: There's a Pokemon say my guy Spiritomb who's not in Pokemon sword shield is right.

242
00:16:08,671 --> 00:16:14,650
Scott: You can hang on to him until a future Pokemon supports it I can put him in Pokemon home, even though Pokemon sword shield does not support spirit.

243
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:17,109
Rym: Yep, it just means you can't put him into sword shield.

244
00:16:18,031 --> 00:16:18,473
Scott: Aha, but I can.

245
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:23,730
Scott: I can save my spiritomb from from the the grave of Pokemon Bank after it gets robbed.

246
00:16:24,032 --> 00:16:28,117
Rym: Yeah, basically if they're still in there Yeah transfers their own way true.

247
00:16:28,137 --> 00:16:30,630
Rym: You can read all the details cuz we're not gonna.

248
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:34,370
Rym: I'm not gonna explain to you exactly how this works cuz it's not something I'll use.

249
00:16:34,531 --> 00:16:36,377
Rym: I don't ever transfer Pokemon between games.

250
00:16:36,437 --> 00:16:38,284
Scott: I've done it in my past.

251
00:16:38,344 --> 00:16:38,946
Rym: I have done it.

252
00:16:39,006 --> 00:16:40,090
Rym: I will never do it in the future.

253
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:41,194
Scott: I don't think it's gonna happen.

254
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:41,756
Rym: I'll just buy.

255
00:16:41,796 --> 00:16:42,920
Rym: just play new Pokemon games.

256
00:16:42,981 --> 00:16:43,904
Rym: Like what's that?

257
00:16:44,085 --> 00:16:44,968
Rym: What's that Pokemon?

258
00:16:44,988 --> 00:16:45,369
Rym: Let's go.

259
00:16:46,511 --> 00:16:49,382
Scott: I might go and just look to see how it see how it does.

260
00:16:49,402 --> 00:16:51,430
Rym: Oh, yeah, you can poke at it for free.

261
00:16:51,671 --> 00:16:56,096
Scott: Yeah, I might just poke it when I get home like get my Brush the dust off my D.

262
00:16:56,136 --> 00:16:57,903
Rym: Yeah, plus you'll get a moment there.

263
00:16:58,044 --> 00:16:59,450
Rym: you get a month free of Bank.

264
00:16:59,892 --> 00:17:00,053
Rym: What?

265
00:17:00,254 --> 00:17:05,560
Rym: the one thing that I find interesting what I don't know what Nintendo will do Sam I do get a month free of Bank just no matter what.

266
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,069
Scott: or do you get a month free of Bank if you pay for?

267
00:17:07,471 --> 00:17:14,869
Rym: Not sure, okay, but I wonder say I put 6,000 Pokemon in Pokemon home and I'm paying this money now, right?

268
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:17,805
Rym: If I stop paying to my Pokemon, I'll die.

269
00:17:17,845 --> 00:17:18,490
Rym: just is gone.

270
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:19,573
Scott: I'm well gonna find out.

271
00:17:19,613 --> 00:17:21,839
Scott: cuz I stopped paying for bang cuz Nintendo.

272
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:32,330
Rym: This is this is one of those ways like with certain unnamed MMORPGs you can basically extort someone into paying for this thing forever.

273
00:17:32,772 --> 00:17:36,189
Rym: So their Pokemon don't disappear even if they don't actually play Pokemon anymore.

274
00:17:37,631 --> 00:17:40,661
Rym: In some other news we haven't actually talked about this.

275
00:17:40,741 --> 00:17:45,997
Rym: it's been the news for a while, but half-life Not three is coming out, right?

276
00:17:46,017 --> 00:17:50,250
Rym: So they're making a game that is not half-life 3, but it's also half-life 3.

277
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,415
Rym: It's called half-life Alex.

278
00:17:51,636 --> 00:17:54,710
Scott: I guess you play as Alex the other character from half-life 2.

279
00:17:54,710 --> 00:18:00,170
Scott: Yeah, I decide the the sidekick girl and it's a VR only game and it looks great.

280
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:06,982
Rym: They're trying to push their VRs their steam valve VRs Yep, which not to the V the way the VR landscape right now is.

281
00:18:07,023 --> 00:18:12,930
Rym: basically there's the normal VR Which is basically like the oculus stuff like that kind of thing.

282
00:18:15,151 --> 00:18:21,766
Rym: Basically Valve is going with their index, which is like the high-end VR, but it's not really.

283
00:18:21,786 --> 00:18:23,010
Rym: I don't think it's materially better.

284
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:32,036
Rym: I don't think there are significant experiences you can make with this upper-end VR that you can't make with like an oculus quest oculus Like rift oculus s type thing.

285
00:18:32,337 --> 00:18:36,030
Scott: I guess it's gonna be like prequel to half-life 2 like what was she up to before?

286
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:39,496
Rym: Gordon Friedman was on yeah Which this is sort of a divide.

287
00:18:39,516 --> 00:18:43,528
Rym: we even saw in the Ignites forum where it seems like there are some people who?

288
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:49,770
Rym: Primarily want a more half-life content because they care about like the lore and the proper right.

289
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:50,172
Scott: So we'll see.

290
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:50,434
Scott: it's like.

291
00:18:50,454 --> 00:18:53,110
Scott: I don't care about the lore of half-life at all.

292
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,778
Scott: No, it's like but like.

293
00:18:54,999 --> 00:18:56,366
Scott: what was the deal with the g-man?

294
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:57,130
Scott: I don't give a shit, right?

295
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:02,470
Scott: But the point is half-life 2 episode 2 whatever ended on a crazy cliffhanger.

296
00:19:02,631 --> 00:19:03,960
Rym: But I already don't care like.

297
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,450
Rym: I just don't care about what happens.

298
00:19:05,671 --> 00:19:12,059
Rym: I just want more games that do the mechanical type of cinematic gameplay Storytelling that half-life games do.

299
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,208
Rym: the proper nouns mean nothing to me at this point.

300
00:19:14,429 --> 00:19:36,587
Scott: Yep but also It's interesting that valve is doing this right and not half-life 3 When valve has had like so many pretty much all their recent attempts since half-life 2 ended to make games besides dota 2 No, and besides counter-strike, but even sort of counter-strike and even worse.

301
00:19:36,648 --> 00:19:45,821
Rym: based on my Like the people who have left valve over the years and talked about what it's like to work there I don't feel like valve is able to retain good game design.

302
00:19:45,921 --> 00:19:47,987
Scott: No, so it's like their artifact thing.

303
00:19:48,028 --> 00:19:48,810
Scott: Remember that fiasco?

304
00:19:49,532 --> 00:19:51,519
Scott: So that game hasn't been updated in a year.

305
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:52,000
Scott: right?

306
00:19:52,281 --> 00:20:00,350
Scott: counter-strike for all the fact that it's still alive has Tons of fiascoes going on with gambling like like even the worst possible game we talk about like.

307
00:20:00,514 --> 00:20:06,890
Scott: Oh, yeah All these other loot box games is children gambling like counter-strike is even more literal gambling.

308
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:09,984
Rym: But also valve didn't make the original counter-strike.

309
00:20:10,005 --> 00:20:11,110
Rym: They bought it, right?

310
00:20:12,112 --> 00:20:13,077
Scott: You know, they got their dota.

311
00:20:13,097 --> 00:20:17,313
Scott: they got their you know, their dota Underlords whatever.

312
00:20:17,334 --> 00:20:19,563
Scott: I don't know if anyone's playing that still right there.

313
00:20:19,723 --> 00:20:21,410
Scott: They're their auto chess version.

314
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:25,182
Scott: It seems like the League of Legends auto chess version has become the champion.

315
00:20:25,804 --> 00:20:29,167
Scott: League of Legends also has a new card game That seems like is that gonna beat?

316
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:36,334
Scott: Hearthstone and you know, we obviously artifact isn't in the in the race anymore EBD, right.

317
00:20:36,656 --> 00:20:39,450
Scott: It seems like the League of Legends or people are making all that riot.

318
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:45,090
Rym: Yeah, but there's some controversies about riot that have escalated recently, but I'm just talking about in terms of success.

319
00:20:45,493 --> 00:20:47,930
Scott: They seem to be making these successful.

320
00:20:48,674 --> 00:20:49,450
Scott: PC games.

321
00:20:52,571 --> 00:20:56,522
Scott: Valve and Blizzard have fallen off and riot has taken their.

322
00:20:56,602 --> 00:21:05,872
Scott: they used to have just one game League of Legends and now that they Made an auto chess and they made a card game Yeah, and it seems like they're branching out and being like, alright, we're the biggest game in town We can.

323
00:21:05,953 --> 00:21:08,289
Scott: you know valve is weak, you know Blizzard is weak.

324
00:21:08,651 --> 00:21:10,277
Scott: I guess attack while they're down.

325
00:21:10,377 --> 00:21:17,750
Rym: what I trust about this game if nothing else is that Based it valve does not tend to release games like this.

326
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:24,699
Rym: Like they're not gonna risk fucking up their half-life franchise because half-life 3 They only risked it like several times.

327
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,393
Rym: Well, I mean they made it well, they made half-life 1. that was a risk And it paid out.

328
00:21:28,855 --> 00:21:30,219
Rym: they made half-life 2. that was a risk.

329
00:21:30,239 --> 00:21:30,922
Rym: that it paid out.

330
00:21:31,524 --> 00:21:32,648
Rym: The portal is adjacent.

331
00:21:32,748 --> 00:21:38,281
Rym: that paid out Half-life 3. if they fuck it up like that kind of ends the franchise.

332
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,488
Scott: the fortress 2 that you're left for deads.

333
00:21:40,548 --> 00:21:44,475
Scott: Yeah That's well so but I did.

334
00:21:44,735 --> 00:21:49,112
Rym: but I feel like the fact that they're making a half-life game means that They're.

335
00:21:49,633 --> 00:22:05,422
Rym: I feel like they're gonna give it their all and I feel like this game is has the potential to be one of the few games that will take the fullest advantage of the current capabilities of Consumer accessible home VR and make one of the best possible games you can make.

336
00:22:05,883 --> 00:22:10,061
Scott: I think it's gonna be a game that You don't know shit about VR.

337
00:22:10,082 --> 00:22:11,230
Rym: So I'm really curious what you think.

338
00:22:11,714 --> 00:22:13,730
Scott: I think it's obviously it's gonna be FPS, right?

339
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:25,178
Scott: They're gonna put lots of like the way that half-life 2 had all like those physics Puzzles gonna be a lot of like hand manipulation puzzles are gonna have Like, you know VR stuff.

340
00:22:25,239 --> 00:22:28,530
Scott: that's you know, sort of scooby-dooed in to the to the half-life world.

341
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:32,268
Rym: Well, I think it'll be mostly that you'll be in a room figure deal with the room move on.

342
00:22:32,288 --> 00:22:33,052
Scott: Yep It's good.

343
00:22:33,072 --> 00:22:36,550
Rym: That's how the game probably also some rail shooter type elements.

344
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:39,658
Scott: It's basically that's what's gonna be like which I'm into.

345
00:22:39,678 --> 00:22:40,400
Rym: I also don't.

346
00:22:40,741 --> 00:22:44,050
Scott: I'm also guessing that this game will not be long.

347
00:22:44,472 --> 00:22:47,190
Scott: Oh, no, that's that's like one and two were long.

348
00:22:47,611 --> 00:22:52,690
Scott: I think it will be at most the length of one of those half-life episode have like two episodes.

349
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,920
Scott: Yeah, which will be the longest it could possibly be.

350
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:55,824
Rym: That's the right.

351
00:22:55,844 --> 00:22:57,030
Rym: a lot of people in our game.

352
00:22:57,150 --> 00:23:01,530
Scott: I think a lot of people get this play it be done with it and then put their VR back in the closet.

353
00:23:01,711 --> 00:23:09,921
Rym: Yeah, well, it'll be like the Rick and Morty game, which is also one of these like surprisingly One of the best VR experiences anyone's ever made a lot of competition.

354
00:23:10,282 --> 00:23:15,958
Rym: There's there's about 12 like great VR experiences Available for consumers that you can just buy.

355
00:23:16,299 --> 00:23:18,950
Rym: it's still a hobbyist like so it's like an Atari Jaguar.

356
00:23:19,151 --> 00:23:22,242
Rym: It's edging into the like I said the expanded market.

357
00:23:22,323 --> 00:23:23,949
Rym: I think that's gonna grow rapidly.

358
00:23:23,989 --> 00:23:24,230
Rym: still.

359
00:23:24,551 --> 00:23:27,018
Rym: There's a lot of good stuff in pipelines of various company.

360
00:23:27,078 --> 00:23:28,863
Scott: It's gonna be more like an Atari Jaguar.

361
00:23:29,405 --> 00:23:32,982
Rym: see I disagree strongly But you've never even done modern VR's.

362
00:23:33,022 --> 00:23:34,150
Rym: you have no idea what it's like.

363
00:23:34,995 --> 00:23:41,045
Rym: You can take Scott's opinion with the Ignorant grain of salt that you need to but I'll play this game.

364
00:23:41,366 --> 00:23:42,310
Rym: Scott could play this game.

365
00:23:42,471 --> 00:23:43,456
Rym: I own two VR headsets.

366
00:23:43,476 --> 00:23:45,808
Rym: Scott could just try this game, but I'll probably refuse to.

367
00:23:46,089 --> 00:23:50,990
Rym: thus He won't even be able to talk about it, but I think I'll be fine without playing this game.

368
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:51,957
Scott: There's a lot of other games.

369
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:53,126
Scott: I also have not played.

370
00:23:53,267 --> 00:23:54,932
Rym: I know I Shockingly like.

371
00:23:54,953 --> 00:23:58,084
Rym: of all those games overwatch is the one you'd probably like the most.

372
00:23:58,164 --> 00:23:59,690
Scott: yeah, no, I don't play that.

373
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:00,054
Rym: Why not?

374
00:24:00,296 --> 00:24:01,347
Scott: why would I play that game?

375
00:24:02,112 --> 00:24:02,473
Rym: So what?

376
00:24:02,533 --> 00:24:03,798
Rym: what kind of game do you want?

377
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,284
Scott: what game do I want?

00:24:05,304 --> 00:24:06,207
Rym: yeah like what game are you?

379
00:24:06,287 --> 00:24:07,010
Rym: what game would make you?

380
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:09,343
Rym: Excited I don't feel like you get a game about games anymore.

381
00:24:09,363 --> 00:24:12,383
Scott: I get excited about a game That is nothing like any previous game.

382
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:14,475
Scott: I don't want to see a game That's just more of a same old.

383
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:17,850
Rym: You know you just don't want more tribes to know there's what previous game.

384
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:18,678
Scott: There's no other game.

385
00:24:18,698 --> 00:24:19,687
Scott: That's tribes to right now.

386
00:24:21,051 --> 00:24:25,145
Rym: Okay, but you've played tribes - so why just play a better play tribe super.

387
00:24:25,186 --> 00:24:32,949
Scott: such a brief moment in time You go look tribes - existed for mere months, and I've been alive for many years.

388
00:24:33,531 --> 00:24:37,483
Rym: We played it for about a year and a half before it completely died barely.

389
00:24:37,543 --> 00:24:41,957
Scott: it came out late freshman year and Died early sophomore year.

390
00:24:42,118 --> 00:24:43,183
Rym: No died a late soft.

391
00:24:43,223 --> 00:24:44,730
Rym: We played it a lot in the old apartment.

392
00:24:44,851 --> 00:24:50,810
Rym: I did not go look at the timeline Yeah, but I know how much I played it tribes - did not live long, but it was still there.

393
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,748
Rym: We I also kept playing it long after you gave up.

394
00:24:54,631 --> 00:24:55,938
Scott: It did not live long.

395
00:24:55,978 --> 00:25:01,630
Scott: it was gone by the time in some So he couldn't play it anymore before we get on to reviewing some games.

396
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:13,950
Rym: so there's a lot going on in the eSports and straight eSports streaming and Like streamer streaming markets out there like the twitch youtube gaming all that stuff.

397
00:25:14,392 --> 00:25:18,249
Rym: There's way too much to talk about but the one I think we need to talk about that's the biggest news.

398
00:25:19,213 --> 00:25:26,134
Rym: All the Activision Blizzard things the Overwatch League Call of Duty League Hearthstone everything is Leaving twitch.

399
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:29,890
Scott: now that the contracts up YouTube exclusive, and if they had a contract with - it.

400
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:32,090
Rym: Yeah, there's that there was a exclusive okay?

401
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,454
Scott: But the point is right.

402
00:25:33,655 --> 00:25:36,887
Rym: you get the impression that they were just waiting for this contract to expire.

403
00:25:36,927 --> 00:25:43,070
Scott: well the point is You know the streaming world started out where it was all about the platform.

404
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:48,210
Rym: It's pretty much spent 90 million dollars for the exclusive rights to the first two seasons of overwatch.

405
00:25:48,571 --> 00:25:51,944
Scott: Well, it was pretty much just twitch right in the in the early days.

406
00:25:52,004 --> 00:25:52,607
Scott: everyone right.

407
00:25:52,647 --> 00:26:01,740
Scott: there was no other competition and when competition appeared in the form of YouTube At YouTube it's pretty much YouTube Facebook, and then mixer came.

408
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,164
Scott: you know Microsoft right.

409
00:26:03,184 --> 00:26:14,949
Scott: so all the big boys you got Amazon Google Microsoft and Facebook all four of those are in the streaming video game Competition realm and twitch was just the king because it was the oldest and everyone was there.

410
00:26:15,091 --> 00:26:25,043
Scott: Yeah So it in the earliest days everyone who all the content makers the streamers whether you were pro or just some kid in your house Where you got to be on twitch because that's where the people were.

411
00:26:25,203 --> 00:26:25,665
Scott: yep, right.

412
00:26:25,685 --> 00:26:26,750
Scott: so everyone went to twitch.

413
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:33,570
Scott: But now ninja right for whatever you got to say about the dude ninja and whatever lot of fans.

414
00:26:34,733 --> 00:26:39,548
Scott: He signed that deal with mixer right to leave twitch and all accounts are right.

415
00:26:39,568 --> 00:26:43,737
Rym: that like Decimated the viewership on twitch across the board.

416
00:26:43,777 --> 00:26:47,214
Scott: basically people who were on Twitch right.

417
00:26:47,495 --> 00:26:50,826
Scott: some of them stayed watching twitch, but went to watch other people.

418
00:26:51,207 --> 00:26:52,190
Scott: some of them followed.

419
00:26:52,371 --> 00:26:53,396
Scott: They were just ninja fans.

420
00:26:53,416 --> 00:26:54,863
Scott: They didn't care where ninja was.

421
00:26:54,883 --> 00:26:56,230
Scott: they were such ninja fans.

422
00:26:56,291 --> 00:26:57,509
Scott: They follow him wherever he goes.

423
00:26:57,911 --> 00:26:59,537
Scott: So that's why mixer was.

424
00:26:59,658 --> 00:27:02,208
Scott: Microsoft was willing to make an exclusive deal with Pam.

425
00:27:02,228 --> 00:27:02,730
Scott: a lot of money.

426
00:27:03,192 --> 00:27:04,703
Scott: Get those people to go to mixer.

427
00:27:04,763 --> 00:27:05,790
Scott: so on mixer.

428
00:27:06,151 --> 00:27:11,950
Scott: He has less eyeballs than he had on twitch, but he's got a bunch of you know luxury and his life is easier.

429
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:16,509
Scott: He doesn't have to stream like crazy and get subs because he's got the money from the exclusive deal.

430
00:27:17,151 --> 00:27:25,716
Scott: Right and that seems to be why a lot of the individual streamers have you know sign these deals so easily because it's like ah I don't have to beg for subs.

431
00:27:25,736 --> 00:27:27,181
Scott: You know I can live off this.

432
00:27:27,221 --> 00:27:28,907
Scott: you know regular safe money.

433
00:27:28,927 --> 00:27:35,616
Scott: I'm secure Right you know I don't have to have such a grueling streaming schedule and play games I don't want to play.

434
00:27:35,677 --> 00:27:39,049
Scott: their life is more comfortable right It's a really good deal for them.

435
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:40,008
Scott: So you can't blame them.

436
00:27:40,351 --> 00:27:48,558
Scott: But that when ninja did it and it worked out that opened the floodgates and made people realize aha This is the point at which it's no longer.

437
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:52,690
Scott: the platform owns the eyeballs and you the con talent.

438
00:27:53,312 --> 00:27:56,742
Scott: Right and the talent was going to where the eyeballs were to try to.

439
00:27:56,762 --> 00:27:58,968
Scott: you know fight over the eyeball pie.

440
00:27:59,048 --> 00:27:59,610
Scott: that twitch was.

441
00:28:00,252 --> 00:28:02,940
Scott: Now it's people are there to see.

442
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:13,110
Scott: you know the show right whoever it is whether it's overwatch league or ninja or someone else and They'll just watch whatever channel they happen to be on it.

443
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:18,008
Scott: Yeah, you saw the same thing with like Netflix like everyone has Netflix so everyone had to get the show on Netflix.

444
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:20,796
Scott: now There's other things to go to.

445
00:28:21,077 --> 00:28:25,150
Scott: yeah, so everyone goes to where the show they want to watch is they don't know one.

446
00:28:25,311 --> 00:28:28,689
Scott: There's no one who's like a Netflix fanboy who's like Netflix?

447
00:28:28,769 --> 00:28:32,010
Scott: good You know the same way that like they're super Nintendo agenda seems like though.

448
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:42,130
Rym: There's two things going on here because overwatch league also It seems like one of the reasons they wanted to switch was that twitch only has about 15 million active users.

449
00:28:42,231 --> 00:28:48,084
Rym: like that's the kind of the the Addressable audience of twitch today and YouTube has about 200 million.

450
00:28:48,244 --> 00:28:49,810
Scott: Well, that's you're counting all of YouTube.

451
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:55,357
Scott: You know, if you count only people on YouTube who watch Streaming games on YouTube.

452
00:28:55,537 --> 00:28:56,660
Scott: Yes much much much.

453
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:56,901
Rym: Yes.

454
00:28:56,961 --> 00:29:02,000
Rym: That's why I said addressable market not active market or industry stuff.

455
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:07,685
Rym: so I Suspect that Blizzard Activision Blizzard because it's not just the Blizzard games.

456
00:29:07,725 --> 00:29:08,247
Rym: It's like all that.

457
00:29:08,287 --> 00:29:09,270
Rym: Call of Duty is part of this.

458
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:15,186
Rym: They want to have their eSports on a broader more mass-market platform.

459
00:29:15,688 --> 00:29:22,330
Rym: That's more like Recommendations for it and the algorithms will hit like regular old sports fans, right?

460
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:25,702
Scott: But here's the thing is that you know, you would think it seems obvious right.

461
00:29:25,883 --> 00:29:29,478
Scott: almost everyone on Twitch has a YouTube channel Yeah, and they post their clips to you.

462
00:29:29,558 --> 00:29:31,830
Rym: Like I don't watch a DDQ anywhere but YouTube.

463
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:40,157
Scott: I just wait for the VODs on just about every twitch streamer, you know takes clips and puts them on YouTube and people who are some people only follow.

464
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:42,244
Scott: they'll follow a streamer like ninja on like.

465
00:29:42,284 --> 00:29:44,772
Scott: I don't think ninja has stuff on YouTube anymore if Did.

466
00:29:44,892 --> 00:29:49,728
Scott: but take for example, well Andy the the link to the past randomizer.

467
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,133
Scott: Oh, yeah, right He's got.

468
00:29:51,515 --> 00:29:52,258
Scott: Andy has a YouTube.

469
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:53,021
Scott: All right, and they're.

470
00:29:53,162 --> 00:29:55,110
Scott: they actually make jokes in like the twitch chat.

471
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:59,669
Scott: They'd be like, oh this twitch they'll go in the twitch chat and be like, is that YouTube Andy?

472
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:04,830
Scott: And they'll be like twitch Andy right and there's people though who like only watch him on YouTube.

473
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:07,330
Scott: Yeah, only watch him on Twitch care about him so much.

474
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:18,410
Scott: They follow him on both right and the thinking is there's so many people Watch cuz like you're a streamer You're making pretty much just as much money from people watching your clips on YouTube as you are from your twitch subs.

475
00:30:18,531 --> 00:30:20,270
Scott: Right sort of an even deal maybe.

476
00:30:21,995 --> 00:30:26,510
Rym: And I think it's a lot easier to make money on YouTube because of the ad stuff that I don't want to get into right now.

477
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:27,401
Scott: Could be who knows?

478
00:30:27,462 --> 00:30:31,639
Scott: Well, there's Streamer as your as your profession.

479
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,890
Scott: you you want both of those income streams.

480
00:30:34,091 --> 00:30:38,790
Scott: You want your twitch streamers and your subs and you want your YouTube clip, you know monies also, right?

481
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:50,210
Scott: And the thing is you think be obvious that you'd be able to translate that Audience of people who watch clips of streamers on YouTube to then click on like a related thing.

482
00:30:50,412 --> 00:30:51,569
Scott: You know you pop up on the side.

483
00:30:51,991 --> 00:30:59,415
Scott: You're watching a clip of someone who streamed yesterday and their YouTube streamer and there's like a thing like hey They're live now bro.

484
00:30:59,455 --> 00:31:00,058
Scott: Click here.

485
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:02,267
Scott: Yeah, but you think that's so obvious.

486
00:31:02,328 --> 00:31:05,280
Scott: it would work But it doesn't seem like it has worked.

487
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:09,716
Scott: not a lot of people watch live Streaming games on YouTube.

488
00:31:09,736 --> 00:31:11,603
Scott: It's way smaller than it's.

489
00:31:11,783 --> 00:31:13,710
Scott: feels like it's smaller than I don't have numbers.

490
00:31:13,951 --> 00:31:18,165
Scott: Well, it feels way smaller than even like the Facebook gaming in the mixer.

491
00:31:18,205 --> 00:31:19,670
Scott: It feels like YouTube's in last place.

492
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,734
Rym: So there's even more here.

493
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:22,701
Rym: There's an area where twitch just cannot compete.

494
00:31:23,343 --> 00:31:24,307
Rym: part of the move.

495
00:31:24,769 --> 00:31:25,130
Rym: Is that?

496
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:35,708
Rym: Activision Blizzard is also gonna host all the shit for the live streaming and the tournaments and the eSports in the Google Cloud and the Google Cloud will drive the streaming through YouTube.

497
00:31:36,572 --> 00:31:38,197
Rym: Twitch does not have a cloud platform.

498
00:31:38,217 --> 00:31:39,321
Rym: You can host your infrastructure.

499
00:31:39,341 --> 00:31:39,782
Rym: They do.

500
00:31:39,943 --> 00:31:41,287
Scott: It's Amazon Web Services.

501
00:31:41,408 --> 00:31:43,333
Rym: Yeah It's not this.

502
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:45,519
Rym: it's not quite the same integration level.

503
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:56,069
Rym: Google appears to be providing services on top of that Like they're doing something here and they're integrating the ad network and AI in a way that might be ominous.

504
00:31:57,311 --> 00:31:58,234
Rym: Now I'm reading the article.

505
00:31:58,454 --> 00:32:01,744
Rym: in addition Blizzard plans to use Google AI for her ads.

506
00:32:01,965 --> 00:32:02,225
Rym: quote.

507
00:32:02,526 --> 00:32:12,795
Rym: players will have the optimal Personalized interactions as Activision Blizzard contacting can tap into Google cloud in AI tools to offer curated recommendations for in-game offers and Differentiated gaming.

508
00:32:12,855 --> 00:32:19,157
Scott: I don't see it as I don't feel like any of the platforms except are Technologically better or worse than others.

509
00:32:19,177 --> 00:32:21,203
Scott: I mean the Facebook obvious is the worst interface cuz.

510
00:32:21,223 --> 00:32:22,086
Scott: yeah Facebook II.

511
00:32:22,547 --> 00:32:24,898
Scott: but I mean Why did they go with Google?

512
00:32:24,938 --> 00:32:26,790
Scott: I don't think it's because Google's better.

513
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:30,265
Scott: I think it's because there was probably a bidding war for this contract Google won.

514
00:32:30,285 --> 00:32:33,856
Scott: It's hard to say because It's just how these things do.

515
00:32:34,257 --> 00:32:36,666
Scott: yeah, it's which would have paid more money to keep them.

516
00:32:36,927 --> 00:32:37,950
Scott: they would have stayed right?

517
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:42,107
Rym: Yeah, but I think I think Google offered in send you know, those incentives are part of the.

518
00:32:42,248 --> 00:32:44,329
Scott: you know They're half of the deal.

519
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:45,314
Rym: But it looks.

520
00:32:45,374 --> 00:32:51,705
Rym: it does look like Activision Blizzard awful also saw more value in being on YouTube Based on a bunch of the commentary.

521
00:32:51,765 --> 00:32:52,309
Rym: I'm seeing here.

522
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:53,274
Scott: What are the point?

523
00:32:53,535 --> 00:32:56,126
Rym: I mean, this is new enough news where I don't have any like insight.

524
00:32:56,146 --> 00:32:56,950
Rym: I haven't talked to anyone.

525
00:32:57,251 --> 00:32:59,037
Rym: I'm going off a Kotaku article.

526
00:32:59,258 --> 00:33:00,382
Scott: I think that the main phone.

527
00:33:00,402 --> 00:33:02,107
Rym: I mean this article was posted today at 4 30 p.m.

528
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:06,370
Scott: Yeah, the main point is not that one streaming platform is better than the other.

529
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:08,202
Scott: That's like saying one TV channel is bedding the other.

530
00:33:08,222 --> 00:33:09,490
Scott: they're all just channels, right?

531
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,942
Scott: It's that the we have now reached this breaking point.

532
00:33:12,983 --> 00:33:14,990
Rym: We are well, although you know, they are their ecosystems.

533
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:20,990
Scott: We are definitely past the point at which the platform is no longer the eyeball holder.

534
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:24,813
Scott: platforms now must fight over the content The contents.

535
00:33:25,013 --> 00:33:37,968
Rym: the the streamer or the content makers are now the eyeball holders in this realm Which gives all the platforms even less reason to support non monetizable tiny streamers in any real capacity.

536
00:33:37,988 --> 00:33:38,389
Rym: Mm-hmm.

537
00:33:39,472 --> 00:33:46,339
Scott: So it hasn't stopped, you know any social media site from letting Whoever the hell post tweets.

538
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,550
Rym: Yeah God total aside.

539
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:59,818
Rym: But you all you young kids need to remember that the only reason email works at all is that machines, you never see block 99.99% of all emails anyone ever sends you.

540
00:33:59,838 --> 00:34:19,647
Rym: Mm-hmm Twitter and all social media needs to do the same thing and block 99.99% of all posted content for any from anyone ever seeing it but I digress cuz it's time for Things of the day.

541
00:34:19,848 --> 00:34:29,750
Rym: I think I've linked a big Clive a couple of times in the past But he's the guy who will take apart like dodgy Chinese electronics He buys off eBay and talks about how dangerous they are.

542
00:34:30,031 --> 00:34:32,239
Rym: He'll like look at circuit board like it's really fun channel.

543
00:34:32,746 --> 00:34:33,578
Rym: He'll blow stuff up.

544
00:34:34,121 --> 00:34:40,937
Rym: But he posted something that was so amazing and I watched this whole video and I'm still dumbfounded.

545
00:34:40,956 --> 00:34:42,100
Rym: this fucking thing exists.

546
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:47,487
Rym: So now he's reviewing MREs from armies around Europe and the world.

547
00:34:48,009 --> 00:34:50,436
Rym: Okay, like I got a Lithuanian MRE.

548
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:55,976
Scott: It's about a year expired But as well expired I wouldn't eat it, but well, it depends.

549
00:34:56,016 --> 00:34:59,632
Scott: but the point is I mean It's probably gonna have like Lithuanian kind of food.

550
00:34:59,773 --> 00:35:00,034
Rym: Yeah.

551
00:35:00,074 --> 00:35:01,340
Rym: No, these videos are great.

552
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:05,560
Rym: Like these army ration videos are already like you got like an Indian one.

553
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,880
Scott: It's like those aren't too different from like the bags of Indian food you get at the grocery.

554
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,594
Rym: I've gotten it eaten MREs before they're there.

555
00:35:11,655 --> 00:35:12,620
Rym: Sometimes they're an experience.

556
00:35:12,781 --> 00:35:15,673
Scott: I mean, they can't be that much different from like airplane food.

557
00:35:16,135 --> 00:35:17,380
Scott: Uh, they're probably better than airplane.

558
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,833
Rym: Problem is they're richer.

559
00:35:19,341 --> 00:35:28,839
Rym: Yeah and you need a lot of nutrition because you're military ing and MREs are the ones that you tend to eat like in Combat like that night while you're still like fighting like that kind of thing.

560
00:35:29,281 --> 00:35:33,072
Rym: So but this video is a Scottish Army ration.

561
00:35:33,613 --> 00:35:35,057
Rym: It's the winter calorie.

562
00:35:35,117 --> 00:35:35,859
Scott: Is it full of haggis?

563
00:35:37,023 --> 00:35:40,548
Rym: All right, Scott No, it definitely has had.

564
00:35:40,569 --> 00:35:41,493
Rym: it's actually just ramen.

565
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:45,665
Rym: Oh But yeah, duh This is not.

566
00:35:45,745 --> 00:35:49,540
Scott: I mean it can't be a good thing of the day of the Scottish Army ration doesn't have haggis.

567
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,707
Rym: So it's a winter ration meaning.

568
00:35:51,748 --> 00:35:54,196
Rym: It's extremely high calorie haggis.

569
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:59,271
Rym: Uh What do you think it uses to heat up the food?

570
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:05,411
Scott: because it's MRE has to be completely self-contained, you know in In Japan, they have those things that are illegal.

571
00:36:05,451 --> 00:36:10,499
Rym: in the US where you like pull the string And yeah, it's a lot of MREs use different kinds of things like that that kind of thing.

572
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:13,387
Rym: No, this one's fucking radioactive powered.

573
00:36:13,668 --> 00:36:13,948
Scott: what?

574
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:15,272
Rym: yeah, what.

575
00:36:15,312 --> 00:36:16,495
Rym: indeed watch this video.

576
00:36:16,535 --> 00:36:17,076
Rym: Holy shit.

00:36:17,136 --> 00:36:20,423
Rym: This is a radio a Radiation powered.

578
00:36:20,504 --> 00:36:21,548
Scott: you can't hurry.

579
00:36:21,628 --> 00:36:22,371
Rym: Yes, you can.

580
00:36:22,391 --> 00:36:23,656
Rym: I kind of want one.

581
00:36:23,697 --> 00:36:24,540
Rym: It's amazing.

582
00:36:25,582 --> 00:36:25,865
Scott: What?

583
00:36:26,067 --> 00:36:27,300
Scott: why don't you buy a whole bunch of them?

584
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,648
Rym: And then yeah, you get this radioactive thing.

585
00:36:29,668 --> 00:36:30,792
Rym: you drop it in your ramen.

586
00:36:30,812 --> 00:36:32,177
Rym: You can just cook ramen anywhere.

587
00:36:32,318 --> 00:36:32,880
Rym: What the fuck?

588
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,587
Rym: Yeah, it's reusable.

589
00:36:34,748 --> 00:36:36,135
Scott: Oh, it has some iron bruh.

590
00:36:36,456 --> 00:36:40,658
Rym: It has oh my god Comes with like a bottle of whiskey some iron bruh.

591
00:36:41,983 --> 00:36:44,028
Scott: There was something Scottish in there.

00:36:44,109 --> 00:36:46,174
Rym: Yeah, I saw the iron.

593
00:36:46,335 --> 00:36:48,340
Scott: Well, it's funny not Eminem the best Eminem.

594
00:36:48,448 --> 00:36:56,763
Rym: Yeah Emily and I were watching this and we were like their Trident ingot radiator ration heater fucking radioactive shit What the fuck?

595
00:36:56,903 --> 00:36:57,867
Rym: Yeah, it's amazing.

596
00:36:57,947 --> 00:36:58,469
Scott: Wait, can we?

597
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:01,119
Scott: why don't we search on eBay for Trident ingot?

598
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,725
Rym: Yeah, I kind of want to get one like.

599
00:37:02,745 --> 00:37:06,339
Scott: that would be quite a lot of them and then someone will pay as a visit.

600
00:37:07,883 --> 00:37:09,019
Rym: Kind of want to get just one.

601
00:37:09,782 --> 00:37:11,440
Rym: Cuz that would be a. that's a party.

602
00:37:11,561 --> 00:37:13,392
Rym: You know the the party drink of Europe.

603
00:37:13,735 --> 00:37:14,580
Scott: eat your own food with that.

604
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:19,634
Rym: like if you're at a cocktail party and you're like Oh, let me heat my tea and you pull up on a fucking radioactive heater.

605
00:37:19,734 --> 00:37:21,000
Rym: I'm gonna heat my tea with this thing.

606
00:37:22,261 --> 00:37:22,643
Rym: All you.

607
00:37:22,924 --> 00:37:26,240
Rym: while we were watching this I joked with Emily like I wonder if it comes with whiskey.

608
00:37:26,401 --> 00:37:27,807
Rym: And then of course it came with whiskey.

609
00:37:28,108 --> 00:37:30,820
Rym: and then I was like, well, it didn't come with any iron brew.

610
00:37:31,342 --> 00:37:33,934
Rym: And then sure enough he's like what do we have here?

611
00:37:33,994 --> 00:37:35,260
Scott: So I mean I called the haggis.

612
00:37:35,641 --> 00:37:41,358
Scott: I mean, I didn't think of iron brew until I saw it and I'm like, yeah, I was laughing so hard I had to rewind the video.

613
00:37:42,442 --> 00:37:43,286
Rym: So what's your thing of the day?

614
00:37:43,588 --> 00:37:45,437
Scott: So you may remember back in the day, right?

615
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:49,835
Scott: There was a. it was a series of animated shorts the Senpai Club.

616
00:37:50,457 --> 00:37:57,380
Scott: Oh, yeah By animation pair of people named make babies make baby tightness, right?

617
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,526
Scott: So I was supporting.

618
00:37:59,807 --> 00:38:02,496
Scott: make babies on patreon right like a dollar.

619
00:38:02,597 --> 00:38:03,620
Rym: what I forgot all about him.

620
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,445
Rym: Their last video was 11 months ago.

621
00:38:05,465 --> 00:38:07,371
Scott: Trion recently added this feature.

622
00:38:07,391 --> 00:38:10,280
Scott: That is a very tight integration with discord.

623
00:38:10,752 --> 00:38:11,662
Rym: Oh, yeah I've we.

624
00:38:11,702 --> 00:38:23,215
Scott: I was thinking about using that and what it does is basically if you are Patreoning a patronus, right and they set up a discord and you link your.

625
00:38:23,415 --> 00:38:25,220
Scott: I linked my discord to my patreon account.

626
00:38:25,822 --> 00:38:36,700
Scott: Anytime anyone that I patronize makes a discord and links it to their patreon channel I'm automatically joined and inserted into their discord server.

627
00:38:36,828 --> 00:38:38,388
Scott: Yeah without even asking for it.

628
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:45,000
Scott: and as a result once this feature was Established like I opened up discord and suddenly I was added to like a pile of server.

629
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,189
Scott: Oh, I was like, ah, well who had it?

630
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,435
Scott: Well, I'm I'm like.

631
00:38:48,475 --> 00:38:49,620
Scott: am I logged into the wrong account?

632
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:50,142
Scott: It's not.

633
00:38:50,504 --> 00:38:53,140
Scott: I realized patreon added me to all these discord servers.

634
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:58,159
Rym: So all these communities sort of formed and like some of them are rocking but it seems to have worked.

635
00:38:59,281 --> 00:39:08,516
Scott: There was actually one discord I was in already that I was patronizing and before the feature was implemented And then when the feature came online suddenly a pile of users appeared.

636
00:39:08,536 --> 00:39:17,085
Scott: Yeah, right but yeah, so Suddenly I was in the make babies discord just out of nowhere and I was like, oh, I guess it's got to be a good Community of people.

637
00:39:17,226 --> 00:39:23,756
Scott: It's not that many people I guess but I was like, hey I guess this activity going on in that realm that you know, I thought was lost right.

638
00:39:24,318 --> 00:39:31,500
Scott: and then suddenly Make babies posted this video on their YouTube channel uploaded two days ago about two days ago called menagerie.

639
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:42,327
Scott: Oh my god, this looks so cute, right and it's a short Hilarious animation that seems to have been done as seems like a student team animation kind of deal But it is very high quality.

640
00:39:42,347 --> 00:39:43,794
Rym: Wait, wait, wait goblins.

641
00:39:43,955 --> 00:39:48,148
Scott: All right, right and The make babies person worked on this.

642
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:54,560
Scott: Yeah made for another three-day animation Jam at goblins Alright, so I don't know if this so it's made for a jam.

643
00:39:54,560 --> 00:40:07,460
Scott: okay, I don't know when it was made, but it is very well made very hilarious and Worth watching whether you like, you know Senpai Club or not because it's nothing to do with Senpai Club other than that one of the creators is involved.

644
00:40:08,465 --> 00:40:10,563
Rym: I'm into this Scott.

645
00:40:10,583 --> 00:40:11,688
Scott: how long is the video?

646
00:40:11,708 --> 00:40:12,814
Scott: It's like two minutes.

647
00:40:12,854 --> 00:40:15,065
Scott: Yeah, it's like the funniest two minutes You'll have today.

648
00:40:15,105 --> 00:40:18,503
Rym: Scott links me to this and he's like, it's my thing today and I look at it like, okay This looks cute.

649
00:40:18,524 --> 00:40:18,604
Rym: Then.

650
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:21,160
Rym: He's like look at look at it and I keep looking at it.

651
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,996
Rym: Then I see the YouTube channel like make make babies big baby.

652
00:40:25,096 --> 00:40:28,700
Scott: Whoa How is bad before in the meta moment?

Rym: We are back from back south.

00:40:36,411 --> 00:40:37,575
Rym: The slides are linked.

657
00:40:37,816 --> 00:40:39,260
Rym: The list is linked from the YouTube.

658
00:40:39,362 --> 00:40:39,939
Rym: It's all there.

659
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:40,702
Scott: You can just watch it.

660
00:40:40,843 --> 00:40:49,053
Rym: the schedule for PAX East is live at East dot pack site calm and we are doing a panel That will be new to a lot of people at PAX East.

661
00:40:49,094 --> 00:40:50,060
Scott: Hey, we did it.

662
00:40:50,301 --> 00:40:51,564
Scott: We did this panel once at.

663
00:40:52,106 --> 00:40:54,794
Rym: this is one of my favorite panels we've done in recent memory.

664
00:40:54,894 --> 00:40:56,740
Rym: Yeah, this panel unplug.

665
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:58,455
Scott: No, we don't plugged unplug.

666
00:40:58,495 --> 00:41:02,215
Rym: We did it But it's a guy I like the content of this panel a lot.

667
00:41:02,236 --> 00:41:03,804
Rym: like the moral is good The slides are good.

668
00:41:03,824 --> 00:41:04,608
Rym: Like I love doing this.

669
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:05,935
Scott: It's not a clickbait panel.

670
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:06,820
Scott: It's a good panel.

671
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:09,209
Rym: It's all but it has a clickbait title that'll fill the room.

672
00:41:09,229 --> 00:41:10,454
Scott: It's not that clickbait.

673
00:41:11,016 --> 00:41:11,297
Rym: I don't know.

674
00:41:11,337 --> 00:41:12,180
Rym: take your fucking turn.

675
00:41:12,301 --> 00:41:14,371
Rym: I feel like that'll that brought people in.

676
00:41:14,894 --> 00:41:18,428
Rym: but more importantly It means that we already have a good YouTube video of this.

677
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:21,700
Rym: so we don't have to bring any of our cameras to PAX East.

678
00:41:22,121 --> 00:41:27,380
Rym: Okay, so then yeah, so if you have not seen our panel take your fucking turn.

679
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,079
Rym: It's just on YouTube.

680
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,894
Rym: But for people have no idea who we are who just go to PAX East at 11 30 a.m.

681
00:41:31,934 --> 00:41:36,430

00:41:40,029 --> 00:41:40,679
Rym: It'll be a good time.

684
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,839
Rym: I Don't even want to have to think about that.

685
00:41:47,324 --> 00:41:50,806
Scott: I have not seen too many people below the age of 13 at our panel

686
00:41:50,847 --> 00:41:51,569
Rym: now of a plus

687
00:41:51,769 --> 00:41:53,495
Scott: packs and I don't think anyone even notice

688
00:41:53,515 --> 00:42:04,840
Rym: that that the the hosts of facts Mike and Jerry in the Opening address to the convention which is not flagged 13 plus they had a word fuck at least a thousand times.

689
00:42:05,844 --> 00:42:06,995
Rym: So I feel like we're good there.

690
00:42:08,022 --> 00:42:09,227
Rym: Otherwise PAX East will be lit.

691
00:42:09,448 --> 00:42:20,080
Rym: Scott and I and most of our friends except a couple of them I see you will be enforcing in the evening So you will not see us between 6 and midnight unless you hang out in the respective areas that we enforce.

692
00:42:20,682 --> 00:42:21,867
Scott: I see a lot of people what I'm.

693
00:42:22,328 --> 00:42:23,573
Rym: I do see a lot of people what I'm.

694
00:42:24,035 --> 00:42:25,841
Rym: it is a scary number of Geek guides.

695
00:42:25,902 --> 00:42:35,399
Rym: fans like come up to the main theater entrance because usually all but one of the nights I basically run the entrance by myself for like hours and hours and hours at a time.

696
00:42:35,921 --> 00:42:41,920
Scott: Lotta listeners come up and hang out which is I usually see people in line when they're checking in and checking out their board game.

697
00:42:42,221 --> 00:42:44,470
Rym: Yeah, so, uh, yeah, we'll see you there.

698
00:42:45,012 --> 00:42:46,659
Rym: And now let's talk about a board.

699
00:42:46,739 --> 00:42:46,920
Rym: Oh, yeah.

700
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,427
Rym: And the GeekNights book a book is the tale of Genji.

701
00:42:48,668 --> 00:42:49,191
Rym: Just read it.

702
00:42:49,231 --> 00:42:49,934
Rym: It's about Genji.

703
00:42:50,175 --> 00:42:54,226
Rym: It's kind of a while Not that smart Maybe is it?

704
00:42:54,266 --> 00:42:56,012
Rym: you'll see it Genji.

705
00:42:56,032 --> 00:43:07,229
Rym: I Feel like the whole Everything I've read so far is just kind of throwing shade at Genji by Showing Genji being Genji and everyone else.

706
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:10,159
Rym: everyone I've met who was not Genji seems like a better person than Genji.

707
00:43:12,069 --> 00:43:16,620
Rym: All right Time of crisis the Roman Empire in turmoil, right?

708
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:21,192
Scott: So our friends bring this grog nard looking war game out.

709
00:43:21,312 --> 00:43:23,500
Rym: Well, the box looks like your grog nard work.

710
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,484
Scott: It's a GMT game.

711
00:43:24,525 --> 00:43:26,835
Scott: those that's the company that makes the grog nard war game.

712
00:43:26,875 --> 00:43:27,820
Rym: Yep, right.

713
00:43:27,981 --> 00:43:32,340
Scott: So you're looking at this thing and you're like, yeah, this is not you know, what's this gonna be like, right?

714
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:35,340
Rym: What if I told you it is a deck builder?

715
00:43:35,726 --> 00:43:48,980
Rym: Yep, like Dominion But it's a deck builder where every turn at the end of your turn you take pick up your entire draw deck Choose the five cards you want to draw and put the rest of your draw deck back down, right?

716
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,731
Scott: So that's that's a real work of genius.

717
00:43:50,771 --> 00:43:52,060
Scott: right thing about Dominion, right?

718
00:43:52,441 --> 00:43:55,720
Scott: So Dominion is the like the first real deck builder, right?

719
00:43:55,820 --> 00:44:02,515
Scott: And it's sort of set the stage for all other deck builders And all they all follow the basic template and nothing has been better than opinion.

720
00:44:02,555 --> 00:44:03,840
Scott: You have a deck, right?

721
00:44:03,981 --> 00:44:05,446
Scott: It starts out with just a few cards.

722
00:44:05,526 --> 00:44:12,933
Scott: you draw some you play them all you put them on the discard Acquire more cards that also go in the discard and then you draw more.

723
00:44:12,973 --> 00:44:14,760
Scott: but your draw you shuffle and draw randomly.

724
00:44:15,221 --> 00:44:21,180
Scott: It's like well, what if you could just stack the deck and draw whatever five you wanted it, but everyone's stacking the deck?

725
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:23,030
Scott: Well, it's not that everyone's stacking the deck.

726
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:24,900
Scott: It's that okay, you're stacking the deck.

727
00:44:25,503 --> 00:44:30,810
Scott: So for people out there who obviously are more likely to have played Dominion Imagine you're stacking the deck in Dominion.

728
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:32,960
Scott: turn one fucking five coppers.

729
00:44:33,261 --> 00:44:34,406
Scott: Yeah, turn two.

730
00:44:35,028 --> 00:44:37,800
Rym: what two coppers in three notes.

731
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:43,398
Rym: It's like if you blow your load on a big turn you're aft until that discard reshuffle.

732
00:44:43,458 --> 00:44:44,100
Scott: What can you do?

733
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:46,129
Scott: It's like okay, and then you shuffle again.

734
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:46,833
Scott: See then you are.

735
00:44:46,853 --> 00:44:47,336
Scott: you got mine.

736
00:44:47,376 --> 00:44:48,060
Scott: now I do it again.

737
00:44:48,481 --> 00:44:55,080
Scott: All right, I'm gonna do four coppers and the village that I bought or whatever, you know Whatever card it was that I bought right?

738
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:55,490
Scott: it's like.

739
00:44:56,182 --> 00:45:01,569
Scott: but then you get to the end of your deck and your discard is full of all the good cars that you stacked to make beautiful hands.

740
00:45:02,338 --> 00:45:06,331
Scott: and Dominion is a little different because you can do the infinite draws.

741
00:45:06,572 --> 00:45:11,184
Scott: Yeah, so stacking your deck would be ultra powerful, but There's another thing.

742
00:45:11,204 --> 00:45:12,830
Scott: you can't do that in this.

743
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:15,600
Rym: so there's nothing that lets you draw cards during your turn.

744
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:24,020
Scott: So stacking your deck in this game It removes randomness, which is actually good to make some more game of skill and you it doesn't really help you cheat.

745
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:32,580
Scott: It's not OP because if you give yourself a strong turn Then you you start to go through the whole deck before you can access the discard pile.

746
00:45:32,901 --> 00:45:35,872
Scott: You're gonna have to have a weak turn and it's about choosing.

747
00:45:35,892 --> 00:45:38,040
Scott: All right, maybe I'll take the weak turn on purpose.

748
00:45:38,141 --> 00:45:39,861
Scott: Maybe I'll try to mix the turns together Right.

749
00:45:40,403 --> 00:45:45,200
Scott: The other thing is that this text on some of the cards that does stuff, right?

750
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,008
Scott: But really what?

751
00:45:47,048 --> 00:45:49,360
Rym: the cards are three currencies.

752
00:45:49,822 --> 00:45:58,840
Scott: there are three different currencies influenced with the people influence with the Senate influence with the Military and those three currencies are used to buy actions.

753
00:45:58,940 --> 00:45:59,765
Scott: Which are the real act?

754
00:45:59,785 --> 00:46:02,820
Scott: you have like a menu of actions that all cost action points.

755
00:46:03,242 --> 00:46:08,607
Scott: some of them cause yellow some cost red and some cause blue and Most of them cost at least two.

756
00:46:08,627 --> 00:46:11,440
Scott: I don't think many of the actions cost one.

757
00:46:11,942 --> 00:46:16,060
Scott: So it's like if you're you know, as you stack your deck, okay, I want to do this blue action.

758
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,590
Scott: So I'll take two blue cards in my hand.

759
00:46:18,013 --> 00:46:19,140
Scott: I want to do that red action.

760
00:46:19,281 --> 00:46:21,832
Scott: Oh, I bought a strong red card earlier in the game.

761
00:46:21,873 --> 00:46:23,440
Scott: That is on its own worth to red.

762
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:26,295
Scott: I'll put that in my hand and I want to do this yellow action.

763
00:46:26,315 --> 00:46:27,320
Scott: Well that cost three yellow.

764
00:46:27,441 --> 00:46:28,707
Scott: Well, I can't put six cards.

765
00:46:28,748 --> 00:46:31,120
Scott: So you sort of like plan your next turn, right?

766
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:35,940
Scott: You're picking the action points you need in currency from your deck of what's left of it.

767
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,508
Rym: Anyway, but and here's where the game gets fascinating Like this is what makes this game good.

768
00:46:39,548 --> 00:46:44,130
Rym: and why like we played it multiple times that it packs When we could have played other new games.

769
00:46:44,332 --> 00:46:44,894
Rym: like it's rare.

770
00:46:44,955 --> 00:46:45,980
Rym: We want to play the same game.

771
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:48,099
Scott: We played it one and a half times.

772
00:46:49,461 --> 00:46:51,009
Rym: We pretty much got to the end of that one game.

773
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:56,069
Rym: It was oh it was over the writing was on the wall And I would play it a third time like I would play this again.

774
00:46:56,089 --> 00:47:05,710
Rym: I like this game a lot, but the deck building in this game is actually a Rondel builder that just happens to use cards.

775
00:47:06,051 --> 00:47:09,959
Rym: You're basically just building a Rondel Yeah, and you're filling it in in front of you.

776
00:47:10,321 --> 00:47:21,520
Rym: You're basically and the brilliance of this is that it basically makes the game have a very real-world Wargame like abstraction because the games at essence really kind of a war game.

777
00:47:22,002 --> 00:47:25,156
Rym: Basically, I make my plan at the end of my turn.

778
00:47:25,177 --> 00:47:25,900
Rym: so I look at the board.

779
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:27,305
Rym: I think about the things I want to do.

780
00:47:27,325 --> 00:47:37,480
Rym: I could make a really complex plan where I have the exact number of points From my hand for the next turn to do something specific and powerful, but that might not work out.

781
00:47:37,981 --> 00:47:45,799
Rym: If someone attacks me that I didn't expect barbarians invade the board state changes in a radical way And I have to react to this terrifying new world.

782
00:47:46,121 --> 00:47:50,120
Rym: So I might choose instead a more safe or neutral hand to be able to be reactive.

783
00:47:50,683 --> 00:48:05,700
Rym: So you sort of your plan and you invest in a path but then you have to react to the world when your turn comes about because if you've Invested in a military in the real world and then some shit goes down somewhere It's not like you can just teleport those soldiers somewhere different.

784
00:48:06,175 --> 00:48:09,627
Scott: Yeah Also, you know Like we said the wait the cards are poor.

785
00:48:09,687 --> 00:48:12,276
Scott: our currency points for different to buying different actions.

786
00:48:12,316 --> 00:48:13,400
Scott: that are the actual doings.

787
00:48:13,602 --> 00:48:14,240
Rym: Yep, right.

788
00:48:14,561 --> 00:48:17,132
Scott: So you start the game with I think three three and three.

789
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:18,940
Scott: three blue three red three yellow.

790
00:48:19,302 --> 00:48:22,339
Scott: Pretty much takes at least two to do a meaningful action, you know.

791
00:48:22,701 --> 00:48:29,060
Scott: So you can't really do like all three different kinds of actions in one job.

792
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:34,540
Scott: You're gonna have like a red a military kind of turn or you know a people kind of turn.

793
00:48:34,962 --> 00:48:36,933
Rym: So you got a debate like how are you gonna focus?

794
00:48:36,973 --> 00:48:38,180
Rym: What kinds of things do you want to do?

795
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:40,680
Scott: Well, you can't balance it out.

796
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:47,575
Scott: You can't be like I'm gonna do a little bit of everything every turn because your hands not big enough and you also can't be Like I'm gonna go all military.

797
00:48:47,616 --> 00:48:50,959
Scott: this game It's like okay you go all military in turn one and turn two.

798
00:48:51,562 --> 00:48:52,105
Scott: You can put.

799
00:48:52,326 --> 00:48:53,532
Scott: you have one red card left.

800
00:48:53,552 --> 00:48:55,040
Scott: you can put in your hand which does nothing.

801
00:48:55,842 --> 00:48:56,604
Scott: Right, you can't?

802
00:48:56,744 --> 00:49:05,020
Scott: you have to do all three things and any given turn will almost definitely be not Hitting on all three notes.

803
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:05,782
Scott: it'll be your.

804
00:49:05,923 --> 00:49:14,611
Scott: each turn will be focusing on one and a half of the areas of the game and Ignoring one area of the game pretty much completely like.

805
00:49:14,631 --> 00:49:16,076
Scott: well, I did my military this turn.

806
00:49:16,096 --> 00:49:17,220
Scott: I'm not doing any next turn.

807
00:49:17,624 --> 00:49:19,020
Scott: I did a little bit of people this turn.

808
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:29,500
Scott: I can do a little bit of people next turn but not too much on either turn and only in the latest latest late Game when you have super strong cars that you've acquired from winning already.

809
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:36,940
Scott: Basically, you can do a whole bunch of things in one turn But then your next turn will still be crappy because you just spent all your huge cards in the first turn.

810
00:49:37,142 --> 00:49:38,800
Rym: So kind of an aside, but I just saw this picture.

811
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:39,984
Rym: I want to lose this train of thought.

812
00:49:40,586 --> 00:49:47,500
Rym: my main complaint with the game is that it has some like UX and mechanical problems Because it's made it looks like a grognard war game.

813
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:53,720
Scott: So all the UX and this graphic design of it is grog Nardi like to remember to know your purchasing power and everything.

814
00:49:53,761 --> 00:49:54,540
Rym: They got to look at things.

815
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:57,920
Rym: They have to confirm numbers several times just to make sure you're doing things, right?

816
00:49:58,602 --> 00:50:06,187
Rym: And the first thing I said after I played the game once was if you just made a simple player aid This game would actually go a lot faster Like I can envision a very.

817
00:50:06,287 --> 00:50:09,360
Scott: I think I mean you can just take the same as that game and retheme it.

818
00:50:09,582 --> 00:50:10,512
Rym: No, the theme is perfect.

819
00:50:10,532 --> 00:50:11,200
Rym: I don't want a different thing.

820
00:50:12,202 --> 00:50:21,620
Scott: But the point is if you just made it look like a euro right or like a you know Root style you could totally pass this off to just everyone and it would be like a super popular game.

821
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:22,684
Rym: But the board is fine.

822
00:50:22,724 --> 00:50:24,210
Rym: The only there that the UX boards.

823
00:50:24,290 --> 00:50:25,876
Rym: Okay, the board is fine.

824
00:50:26,237 --> 00:50:26,478
Scott: It's okay.

825
00:50:27,322 --> 00:50:31,160
Rym: I mean yours is you never actually looked at where barbarians could go with your problem?

826
00:50:31,421 --> 00:50:32,284
Scott: No, I mean I looked at it.

827
00:50:32,325 --> 00:50:33,449
Scott: But the point is it's just.

828
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:34,091
Scott: it's not.

829
00:50:34,353 --> 00:50:36,260
Scott: you know, it's not like a beautiful board, right?

830
00:50:36,802 --> 00:50:42,380
Scott: You could give this game just a graphical only makeover and it could be like one of the most popular.

831
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,100
Rym: But all you don't even need to change the board.

832
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:47,740
Rym: You just need to make a handful of player aids that sit next to the board.

833
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:49,940
Rym: I mean that would token sound that would help significantly.

834
00:50:50,081 --> 00:50:52,999
Scott: But I'm saying if you just need this not look like a Roman thing.

835
00:50:53,662 --> 00:50:56,671
Rym: But I don't that the problem is the UX not the UI.

836
00:50:56,691 --> 00:50:59,339
Scott: I mean, I'm just saying that's to sell it.

837
00:51:00,002 --> 00:51:03,767
Scott: Yeah, no one's gonna buy the Roman thing I'll buy the Roman thing.

838
00:51:03,787 --> 00:51:05,776
Scott: mechanics of this game are a hundred percent.

839
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:15,340
Rym: but I'm looking at your aid your AI for because you can like have an AI in the game and it's pretty close to what I would have made as a player aid For the game itself, right?

840
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:22,648
Scott: But I think the game is you know, it's the Romani parts of it are parts that Rym likes But they're not parts that you know, the theme is not.

841
00:51:22,729 --> 00:51:23,993
Rym: the theme is pretty.

842
00:51:24,033 --> 00:51:26,000
Rym: even the core mechanics are pretty tied to the theme.

843
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:26,566
Rym: That's the other.

844
00:51:26,586 --> 00:51:33,929
Rym: they are very tied to the theme Yes, but those that made that makes for a very natural Heuristics and that make the game objectively better.

845
00:51:33,989 --> 00:51:37,320
Rym: For example, there's Italy in the middle and all the other provinces.

846
00:51:37,481 --> 00:51:38,649
Rym: It's a Roman crisis game.

847
00:51:38,669 --> 00:51:40,260
Rym: You're putting your governor's out in place.

848
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:42,792
Scott: Yeah, you can make it a fantasy theme and it would be fine.

849
00:51:42,953 --> 00:51:44,500
Rym: But here's the deal one of the cool mechanics.

850
00:51:44,861 --> 00:51:55,815
Rym: So one of the things you're tracking is you get points every round based on like how much control your dudes have in all the different regions and like how much you've invested into them like having buildings and things.

851
00:51:56,398 --> 00:52:00,352
Rym: but You also track how many turns you had.

852
00:52:00,393 --> 00:52:01,215
Rym: you were the Emperor.

853
00:52:01,416 --> 00:52:02,540
Rym: Yep, meaning you control it.

854
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:04,371
Scott: That's really the number one way to get point.

855
00:52:04,391 --> 00:52:05,740
Rym: That is super neat.

856
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,387
Rym: It's almost like a king of the hill game.

857
00:52:07,407 --> 00:52:10,680
Rym: that's happening in the middle of the rest of this game, right?

858
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:14,160
Scott: But the thing is right unlike real king of the hill, right?

859
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:17,556
Scott: Which as you know the same sort of problems as last hitting and mobiles.

860
00:52:17,616 --> 00:52:20,308
Rym: king of the hill in this game Just gets you points, but also makes you vulnerable.

861
00:52:20,448 --> 00:52:24,710
Scott: is it's not about you know King of the hill type?

862
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:26,340
Scott: rules often get wrong?

863
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:29,912
Scott: Is that whoever's on the hill at the end wins and that can be good.

864
00:52:30,192 --> 00:52:35,160
Rym: but usually it's man like try to do Really flag for the most number of second, right?

865
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:40,760
Scott: It's like you'll play really really really well and dominate the whole game and then at the very end you finally run out of steam.

866
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:42,486
Scott: Someone pushes you off and they win.

867
00:52:42,566 --> 00:52:52,520
Scott: they are the winner and that feels like bullshit because you dominated all that time And that what seems like it was much more difficult and much more worthy of being called the winner, right?

868
00:52:52,882 --> 00:52:56,760
Scott: So this game it's like yeah, you're getting points for the number of turns you were on top.

869
00:52:57,203 --> 00:52:58,996
Scott: It doesn't matter if you're there at the end, right?

870
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,105
Scott: It just matters who is there.

871
00:53:01,165 --> 00:53:04,094
Scott: the longest right the longer you're there the better.

872
00:53:04,134 --> 00:53:07,091
Scott: if you got up fall down and get up Again, and you're up there twice.

873
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:08,040
Scott: That's great.

874
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:10,974
Scott: That's just as being good as being up there twice as long.

875
00:53:10,994 --> 00:53:15,233
Scott: and even if you say You know dump on the last turn and have a sad ending.

876
00:53:15,253 --> 00:53:18,606
Scott: Yeah, you know because Rome Yeah, Rome.

877
00:53:18,787 --> 00:53:23,329
Scott: Yeah, you'll still be declared the victor I get I get.

878
00:53:23,389 --> 00:53:29,860
Rym: I get into a really precarious situation But then like everyone else got into some bullshit and I ended up in Italy but really weak.

879
00:53:30,362 --> 00:53:45,800
Rym: But everyone else was so stuck dealing with their own crap That I kind of just hung out as Emperor for a few turns Like I just held on because everyone really wanted to unseat me But no one was willing to spend their whole turn doing it because they had other like much more important things to deal with.

880
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:51,494
Scott: Well also mechanically speaking, you know There are many games out there that have a variety of victory conditions to choose from.

881
00:53:51,594 --> 00:53:55,780
Scott: or if they don't have different victory conditions They have different ways to get victory points.

882
00:53:55,820 --> 00:54:01,160
Scott: You could go say crown of Amara you could get red or you can go book right in this game.

883
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:05,220
Scott: You could go and as a way to get victory points try to be the Emperor the longest.

884
00:54:05,281 --> 00:54:07,380
Scott: Yeah, that will totally help you get a lot of victory points.

885
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:10,651
Rym: You can also be popular in the districts that you control.

886
00:54:10,671 --> 00:54:13,480
Rym: Yep, and or fight barbarians, right?

887
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:23,380
Scott: You could just be popular in a few places or somewhat popular in a lot of places like yeah, okay Rym You're the Emperor the whole damn game, but I'm super popular everywhere else.

888
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:26,996
Scott: Yeah, and you're just the pup, you know puppet Emperor.

889
00:54:27,016 --> 00:54:29,484
Scott: All right Right.

890
00:54:29,785 --> 00:54:39,480
Scott: Well, yeah, you guys are all popular and whatever I went around destroying all the barbarians and all of these different ways to get points are equally strong.

891
00:54:39,621 --> 00:54:42,816
Scott: I can't say that like one of them is just better than the others.

892
00:54:42,957 --> 00:54:43,843
Scott: Yep, right It's like.

893
00:54:43,883 --> 00:54:45,737
Scott: yeah, you can win in any of those ways.

894
00:54:45,818 --> 00:54:56,260
Rym: one You gotta gotta balance how you're approaching the game - you have to react to what the other players are doing Yep, and three the game is more like a war game and that there's a lot of random bullshit that happens.

895
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:58,047
Scott: Well, the barbarian fountains are random.

896
00:54:58,288 --> 00:54:59,954
Rym: Well, yeah, the barbarian fountains are random.

897
00:55:00,135 --> 00:55:03,899
Rym: The event cards are random Like shit just goes wrong all the time.

898
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:10,520
Rym: Yep, Zenobia came up like right away and it was like messing with Italy in both our games just randomly.

899
00:55:10,922 --> 00:55:14,860
Rym: But that's fun because that uncertainty is what makes this more like a war game.

900
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:17,249
Rym: Well without the more naturalistic heuristic.

901
00:55:17,269 --> 00:55:20,060
Scott: well because of this deck stacking, right?

902
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:25,039
Scott: There is no other source of randomness besides the barbarians and event deck.

903
00:55:25,602 --> 00:55:28,613
Scott: Therefore without those you would just solve.

904
00:55:28,653 --> 00:55:30,340
Scott: this game like this is the optimal play.

905
00:55:30,662 --> 00:55:32,480
Scott: Start try to start in these places.

906
00:55:32,962 --> 00:55:44,340
Rym: Stack your deck these this way buy these cards or at best it would end up turning into Honda's toy Tonica where the game is purely reacting to what other players are doing in a cycle, right?

907
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:49,279
Scott: Now the barbarian the randomness could affect one player more than others, but that's working.

908
00:55:49,319 --> 00:55:53,440
Rym: sometimes It's like sometimes open like Africa just gets overrun early and that sucks.

909
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:56,780
Scott: But if you were there in aggregate it goes after everyone equally.

910
00:55:57,201 --> 00:56:02,320
Scott: So even though the barbarians happen to overrun Rym this game, right?

911
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:08,400
Scott: It's like I still had to prepare just as much for barbarian invasion because it could happen in any moment.

912
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:16,485
Rym: yep, or I take a risk and I like don't put any armies in Africa because I got a plan and then Barbarians happen there.

913
00:56:16,505 --> 00:56:18,793
Rym: It's like well, oops, but maybe they don't.

914
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:20,760
Rym: or maybe I got federati and I'm good to rock.

915
00:56:20,941 --> 00:56:22,507
Scott: Yeah, but that's a gamble.

916
00:56:22,547 --> 00:56:25,520
Scott: still it is a gamble and it's a gamble for everyone equally.

917
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:38,362
Scott: even though you know the tide might splash upon one player and not another everyone still had to pay the the price of Gambling, you know one way or the other or play out safe and I'm not gonna explain all the mechanic Like.

918
00:56:38,383 --> 00:56:39,480
Rym: I'm not gonna teach you this game.

919
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:39,982
Rym: That would be.

920
00:56:40,002 --> 00:56:40,684
Rym: we already taught you.

921
00:56:40,724 --> 00:56:47,520
Scott: the core mechanic of the game is deck building game where you stack your deck But you still can't access the discard.

922
00:56:47,605 --> 00:57:03,140
Scott: Yeah And you're buying power to buy more cards is based on your popularity and control of provinces And there's several ways to get points and control is only with Popular and killing barbarians and all three of them are equally viable ways to get points.

923
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:09,511
Rym: You're probably gonna have to mix it up to some extent and there's a bunch of fun little mechanics Like the only one I'll talk about like there's you know militias.

924
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:12,120
Rym: then you got like Roman legions and all this stuff.

925
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:13,264
Rym: But there's mobs.

926
00:57:13,986 --> 00:57:14,628
Scott: Oh the angry mob.

927
00:57:14,648 --> 00:57:18,080
Scott: The funniest thing about a mob is the fuck you stick.

928
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:20,109
Scott: It's like I just want I want and Rym's winning.

929
00:57:20,129 --> 00:57:22,659
Scott: I put mobs on Rym, but mobs are real funny.

930
00:57:23,104 --> 00:57:26,750
Rym: There's other things that can cause miles but basically if a mob it's usually putting them on other place.

931
00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:37,815
Rym: if a mob is in your territory like you have a governor in A territory and there's a mob then if you don't deal with that shit before the end of your turn you get less popular And if you're too unpopular, you just get replaced.

932
00:57:38,136 --> 00:57:38,780
Rym: Yeah, like you're out.

933
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:45,567
Rym: Yep, one way to deal with a mob is just if you have a legion there just go kill it But then people get pissed off.

934
00:57:45,969 --> 00:57:46,391
Scott: Oh, yeah, this is.

935
00:57:46,411 --> 00:57:47,696
Scott: there's two different ways to remove.

936
00:57:47,756 --> 00:57:50,164
Rym: or you can build circuses You can run games.

937
00:57:50,244 --> 00:57:55,520
Scott: Yeah, you can remove a mob with red military cards at but that costs you popularity.

938
00:57:55,540 --> 00:58:04,596
Rym: You can play or you get yellow rifle card and placate the mob with yellow cards or you can build a build an amphitheater and then the mobs will stay and they'll still be a problem.

939
00:58:04,616 --> 00:58:19,605
Rym: grow because Also at the end of your turn if any territory as a mob Daddy to mobs a bigger angrier mod the mob just keeps growing until you deal with it and the bigger if you have a Mob.

940
00:58:19,706 --> 00:58:22,080
Scott: but I have a Colosseum so it's gonna be one last game we played.

941
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:25,360
Rym: I just kept a pet mob for a couple turns because I didn't want to deal with it.

942
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:29,500
Scott: There's also a building you can build that will deal with barbarians and convert them to your armies.

943
00:58:29,982 --> 00:58:32,757
Scott: As long as your army is mostly Roman you could that's just no.

944
00:58:32,777 --> 00:58:34,183
Rym: yeah the card Federati will do that.

945
00:58:34,224 --> 00:58:43,771
Rym: the building just means when barbarians come into a territory where there's lemase or limes Yeah, they'll come in flipped over like inactive But then they're easy to bring in.

946
00:58:43,791 --> 00:58:45,580
Scott: Yeah, you don't to fight them, right?

947
00:58:46,001 --> 00:58:51,720
Scott: But him next turn if they're still sitting there, yeah, but you know, they'll just kill themselves effectively if you played the Federati's.

948
00:58:52,809 --> 00:58:54,906
Rym: Yeah There's a lot going.

949
00:58:54,926 --> 00:58:56,879
Rym: this game is meaty and fun.

950
00:58:57,642 --> 00:58:59,667
Rym: There aren't really other don't be right.

951
00:58:59,747 --> 00:59:02,514
Scott: Don't be fooled by its grog Nardi war game.

952
00:59:02,554 --> 00:59:08,554
Scott: Look, it's basically an awesome Euro game just like all those other awesome euro games you're used to but with a lot of.

953
00:59:08,574 --> 00:59:17,700
Rym: it's not any harder than a Dominion or a small world but with a lot of the war game type That make war games interesting there's a lot of little harder than this plan.

954
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:27,058
Rym: There's a lot of emergent behavior a lot of narrative will come about and the kind of planning you do in the game isn't the math of my next turn so much as the.

955
00:59:27,078 --> 00:59:38,400
Rym: I need to focus on this area of the board or this type of thing next turn and I need to be mindful of the fact that based on that I will have fewer options until I reshuffle my deck.

956
00:59:38,802 --> 00:59:40,791
Rym: So do I blow my wad now?

957
00:59:40,851 --> 00:59:42,659
Rym: do I save my wad for a later turn?

958
00:59:43,341 --> 00:59:43,924
Rym: What do I do?

959
00:59:43,965 --> 00:59:51,460
Scott: not and also not enough can be said about again, you know There are lots of games that do this where they take a mechanic from another game and sort of let you cheat.

960
00:59:51,601 --> 00:59:53,140
Scott: It's like well that would be cheating in Dominion.

961
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:59,120
Scott: So you get that extra fun of feeling like you're cheating and it's okay and it but then the game is actually good.

962
00:59:59,221 --> 00:59:59,947
Scott: So it doesn't.

963
01:00:00,270 --> 01:00:00,976
Scott: it's not that strong.

964
01:00:01,057 --> 01:00:07,323
Scott: Yep I feel like I would have but it's fun to do a thing in a game that feels like cheating in the game The mechanic came from.

965
01:00:07,905 --> 01:00:10,392
Scott: so I feel like that's actually for game designers out there.

966
01:00:10,753 --> 01:00:17,900
Scott: find a game that has a mechanic and There's like an obvious rule for that mechanic that yeah, obviously you can't do that.

967
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:19,527
Scott: That would be crazy op and cheating.

968
01:00:19,788 --> 01:00:22,459
Scott: but then make a game where everyone's allowed to do that and it's not op.

969
01:00:22,721 --> 01:00:25,579
Rym: Yep, and if you keep doing that, you'll just make dune maybe.

970
01:00:27,122 --> 01:00:29,240
Rym: But yeah, I feel like I want to own this game.

971
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:32,289
Rym: I think our New York set would like this and play it.

972
01:00:32,550 --> 01:00:32,670
Rym: Uh-huh.

973
01:00:33,292 --> 01:00:35,037
Scott: And I was like, have we played any game?

974
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:38,731
Rym: Oh In New York, well, we haven't been in New York for a while.

975
01:00:38,772 --> 01:00:39,375
Rym: is the problem?

976
01:00:39,737 --> 01:00:41,570
Rym: like every weekend I'm an out of town or something.

977
01:00:41,591 --> 01:00:50,699
Rym: Uh-huh last weekend I was skiing so the time you're ready to play a game in New York is gonna be warm Yeah, but then I can easily bike to your place where there's critical mass because there are four gamers and I'll be there.

978
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:51,703
Scott: I'll be biking.

979
01:00:51,883 --> 01:00:55,458
Rym: Yeah, but yeah, I'll also be biking but then that night we'll play a game.

980
01:00:55,779 --> 01:00:56,080
Rym: obviously.

981
