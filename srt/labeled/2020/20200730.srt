1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:00,681
Rym: go live.

2
00:00:08,912 --> 00:00:11,936
Rym: It's Thursday, July 30th, 2020.

3
00:00:11,936 --> 00:00:12,376
Rym: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:12,957 --> 00:00:13,478
Scott: I'm Scott.

5
00:00:13,658 --> 00:00:15,000
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,706
Rym: Tonight, we're talking about power tools.

7
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:22,190
Rym: Let's do this.

8
00:00:23,873 --> 00:00:24,574
Rym: Warm today.

9
00:00:24,594 --> 00:00:27,038
Scott: Warm yesterday.

10
00:00:27,058 --> 00:00:29,785
Rym: And gonna be warm for a while now.

11
00:00:29,865 --> 00:00:33,260
Rym: We're in the middle of a long running heat wave in New York City right now.

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,165
Rym: It is crazy hot.

13
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:36,127
Rym: I'm not complaining.

14
00:00:36,248 --> 00:00:37,010
Rym: I love this shit.

15
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:42,826
Rym: But since the quarantine started, I run a half marathon every weekend.

16
00:00:42,886 --> 00:00:46,981
Rym: I'm trying to do one every single weekend for the entire summer.

17
00:00:47,001 --> 00:00:50,592
Scott: It's gonna be kind of hard with this AQI situation.

18
00:00:51,855 --> 00:00:52,698
Rym: I'm just doing it anyway.

19
00:00:52,798 --> 00:00:56,230
Rym: I've done half marathons on upper orange days before.

20
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,937
Rym: I'm just doing it.

21
00:00:57,957 --> 00:01:01,628
Scott: Well, this is the weather even before there was a deadly virus.

22
00:01:02,751 --> 00:01:05,983
Scott: Even before they were like, "Yeah, gotta cancel the Olympics biz out of

23
00:01:06,023 --> 00:01:06,906
Scott: this.".

24
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:14,976
Rym: It's interesting because the air in New York, at least in the first part of the quarantine, was better than it had ever been because there weren't any cars.

25
00:01:15,338 --> 00:01:18,953
Rym: But now as things are starting to open up, cars are coming back and the air is getting bad again.

26
00:01:20,118 --> 00:01:21,503
Rym: But it's only like a 50 today.

27
00:01:21,603 --> 00:01:24,131
Rym: It's still actually way better than it would be normally.

28
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:33,600
Scott: You know what's found interesting is that the hallways in my building outside of the apartments are always frigid cold.

29
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,431
Scott: They air conditioned the hell out of those hallways.

30
00:01:35,451 --> 00:01:39,652
Rym: Ours has central air conditioning just for those, but all the units are doing separate AC.

31
00:01:39,993 --> 00:01:45,612
Scott: Obviously, you can open your door to get free air conditioning, I guess.

32
00:01:45,893 --> 00:01:52,316
Scott: So what I noticed though is we set our air conditioner temperature at 78, which is I think higher than just about everyone.

33
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:54,140
Rym: Yeah, mine is 76.

34
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:59,980
Scott: But that is what Con Edison recommends as the most efficient, and it's not uncomfortable.

35
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,650
Scott: It feels just fine in the apartment.

36
00:02:02,671 --> 00:02:04,840
Scott: You're not upset when you're in here that it's warm.

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,674
Scott: Unless a whole lot of people come in, then it can get kind of warm.

38
00:02:09,577 --> 00:02:14,720
Scott: But other than that, I think most people in the building are setting it way lower than that, I would imagine.

39
00:02:16,702 --> 00:02:28,960
Scott: The thing is, I noticed starting around a couple days into this heat wave, the hallways are suddenly warmer than our apartment, which has never happened before.

40
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:29,742
Rym: Trouble brewing.

41
00:02:30,385 --> 00:02:30,606
Scott: Right.

42
00:02:30,646 --> 00:02:38,054
Scott: No matter what, the hallway has always been way, way, way colder than our apartment, but suddenly it's warmer than our apartment.

43
00:02:38,295 --> 00:02:45,559
Scott: And our apartment is probably one of the warmest ones in the building considering how high we set the AC for efficiency's sake.

44
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:47,885
Scott: So that's interesting.

45
00:02:47,905 --> 00:02:49,614
Rym: Obviously, there's no follow-up.

46
00:02:49,635 --> 00:02:52,723
Rym: You didn't check on what's the cost.

47
00:02:52,944 --> 00:02:54,469
Scott: I just assumed the building is being cheap.

48
00:02:55,231 --> 00:02:55,432
Rym: Yeah.

49
00:02:55,753 --> 00:03:04,002
Rym: But one thing with these, my half marathons, because it's like with the heat index, it's like a hundred degrees when I run these sometimes.

50
00:03:04,865 --> 00:03:07,134
Rym: And it's not really heard my times.

51
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:09,985
Rym: Like I'm still getting them under two, but like not that much under two.

52
00:03:10,005 --> 00:03:19,659
Rym: But the one thing I noticed specifically is that my average heart rate is like 10 to 15 beats per minute higher during this heat wave than it normally is.

53
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:23,068
Rym: It's at like 170 something for the entire run.

54
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:27,762
Rym: When during normal weather, it's at like 160 for the entire run.

55
00:03:27,782 --> 00:03:33,022
Rym: I've never had data like that before to pour over, but it's interesting to be able to do those comparisons.

56
00:03:33,423 --> 00:03:44,515
Rym: But the reason why I bring all that up is my news, because there's an article breaking, making the rounds like yesterday, and it's not sensationalism.

57
00:03:44,635 --> 00:03:45,257
Rym: It is true.

58
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:48,414
Rym: But the article basically says, and there's a bunch of people reporting on it.

59
00:03:48,454 --> 00:03:49,098
Rym: It's New York Times.

60
00:03:49,159 --> 00:04:00,573
Rym: I'm not linking to them because the paywall, but it basically says that New York right now is not, by any definition, the climate that everyone thinks it is.

61
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,982
Rym: It is actually officially humid subtropical.

62
00:04:04,383 --> 00:04:07,252
Rym: Like New York City is a humid subtropical climate.

63
00:04:07,974 --> 00:04:08,636
Scott: Fantastic.

64
00:04:09,017 --> 00:04:11,284
Scott: That's almost my favorite climate.

65
00:04:11,324 --> 00:04:23,528
Rym: Which does explain a lot of things like how we've sort of morphed into, instead of having a spring, summer, winter, fall that are relatively equal length and well-defined, we basically have a really short spring.

66
00:04:23,989 --> 00:04:30,628
Rym: Fall is split into a late summer and then a rainy season, and we're having a rainy season in New York.

67
00:04:31,973 --> 00:04:35,145
Rym: The interesting part of this news is not that, because that is real.

68
00:04:35,325 --> 00:04:36,430
Rym: That is not sensationalism.

69
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,154
Rym: That is a thing.

70
00:04:37,415 --> 00:04:37,997
Rym: That happened.

71
00:04:38,078 --> 00:04:39,743
Rym: We live in a subtropical climate now.

72
00:04:40,505 --> 00:04:40,766
Scott: Sweet.

73
00:04:41,408 --> 00:04:51,696
Rym: The news that's interesting is that historical analysis has confirmed New York City has been humid subtropical for five years now.

74
00:04:51,716 --> 00:04:53,080
Scott: Oh, okay.

75
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,387
Rym: It's been this way for a while.

76
00:04:55,768 --> 00:04:58,398
Rym: No one thought, like, no one was talking about it.

77
00:04:58,459 --> 00:05:00,808
Rym: No one was like, what should we consider that?

78
00:05:00,828 --> 00:05:02,716
Rym: maybe the climate has changed in this place?

79
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,650
Rym: But it has, and I found an article that's not behind a paywall.

80
00:05:05,671 --> 00:05:07,139
Scott: There's this thing called climate change.

81
00:05:07,159 --> 00:05:07,943
Scott: that's been happening.

82
00:05:07,963 --> 00:05:09,029
Scott: I don't know if you've heard of it.

83
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:12,705
Rym: Yep, and it's happening a lot faster than a lot of people realize.

84
00:05:14,971 --> 00:05:18,080
Rym: So, New York summers are going to be like this forever, basically.

85
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,786
Rym: Like, that's never going to change.

86
00:05:20,048 --> 00:05:21,836
Rym: This is a normal New York summer.

87
00:05:21,896 --> 00:05:27,277
Rym: This heat wave, we're probably going to have a heat wave like this every year around this time.

88
00:05:27,578 --> 00:05:32,899
Rym: We're probably going to also have a rainy season once or twice a year, depending on how things go.

89
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:34,641
Scott: Sweet.

90
00:05:35,203 --> 00:05:35,423
Scott: Cool.

91
00:05:35,624 --> 00:05:36,367
Scott: Yeah.

92
00:05:36,728 --> 00:05:38,996
Rym: It's kind of like watching a tornado rip through some stuff.

93
00:05:39,076 --> 00:05:42,389
Rym: I can enjoy that because I did not cause that.

94
00:05:42,891 --> 00:05:46,764
Rym: And while I want to prevent that from happening, doing everything I can.

95
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:48,969
Scott: Yep, exactly.

96
00:05:49,431 --> 00:05:49,691
Rym: Yep.

97
00:05:49,812 --> 00:05:51,757
Rym: So, I don't know.

98
00:05:51,797 --> 00:05:54,044
Scott: I mean, I guess I could turn off the air conditioner entirely.

99
00:05:54,064 --> 00:05:59,625
Rym: Yeah, but increasingly the evidence shows that individual action like that is not what needs to happen.

100
00:05:59,665 --> 00:06:06,647
Rym: We need industry to be reformed and we could afford it if we say confiscated Jeff Bezos' money.

101
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:07,631
Rym: Right.

102
00:06:07,731 --> 00:06:18,307
Scott: I'm pretty sure that I've read things like, yeah, like one big boat full of, you know, one big giant cargo container ship is making more pollution than all of New York's air conditioners combined.

103
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:18,568
Scott: Yep.

104
00:06:18,789 --> 00:06:24,671
Rym: Regulation of industry and agriculture is the key, coupled with seizing the wealth of billionaires.

105
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:25,736
Scott: Yeah.

106
00:06:25,837 --> 00:06:26,400
Scott: Well, you know.

107
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,207
Rym: Yeah, but that's a topic for another show.

108
00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:32,206
Rym: So, you can read this article if you want to see the details of this.

109
00:06:32,246 --> 00:06:36,766
Rym: You can read the New York Times article if you want to get the full details, but I don't pay for that.

110
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:43,508
Scott: Well, you know, you said seizing the wealth of billionaires is a topic for another show, but in fact, that is my news.

111
00:06:46,215 --> 00:07:05,863
Scott: So, you know, there have been various times throughout the US history, you know, where the CEOs of major technology companies or other notable nerds like, you know, have been called in to, you know, congressional hearings to bear witness under oath.

112
00:07:06,184 --> 00:07:06,425
Scott: Right.

113
00:07:06,907 --> 00:07:13,990
Scott: And Congress people are able to ask them questions and force them to give truthful answers under some threat of law.

114
00:07:14,171 --> 00:07:14,351
Scott: Right.

115
00:07:14,391 --> 00:07:18,706
Rym: Like now to set this up before Scott talks about this, because it's a good topic.

116
00:07:18,746 --> 00:07:27,474
Rym: But normally the way these hearings go down is Democrats either ask like pointless, boring questions or they ask the good questions.

117
00:07:27,815 --> 00:07:35,441
Rym: And Republicans tend to just follow up on like fascist nonsense or like like Republicans just do ridiculous bullshit in these hearings.

118
00:07:35,461 --> 00:07:37,128
Rym: Like they never contribute meaningfully.

119
00:07:37,148 --> 00:07:38,312
Rym: Yeah.

120
00:07:38,352 --> 00:07:43,126
Rym: That's like the normal operation of these types of hearings.

121
00:07:43,146 --> 00:07:48,719
Scott: So we did do, I believe, a tech show on monopolies at some point.

122
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:49,000
Scott: Right.

123
00:07:49,863 --> 00:07:53,416
Rym: I feel like we have all four of these companies should be broken up.

124
00:07:53,456 --> 00:07:55,242
Rym: That is our personal opinion, if you were.

125
00:07:55,282 --> 00:07:59,954
Scott: Well, that's apparently the opinion of the subcommittee chair.

126
00:07:59,974 --> 00:08:11,598
Rym: The problem is we want to break them up because we want to seize the wealth of incredibly rich people for the good of all and not let these bad outcomes happen from these like shadow run style mega corps.

127
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:20,229
Rym: But generally in America, conservatives want to break up tech companies because they see tech companies as resisting their efforts to install fascists.

128
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:21,533
Scott: Sure.

129
00:08:22,455 --> 00:08:30,884
Scott: But, you know, the Democrats want to break them up because they believe that they're violating antitrust laws, harming and harming their constituents.

130
00:08:31,065 --> 00:08:34,462
Rym: So you have two groups that want the same thing for radically different reasons.

131
00:08:35,245 --> 00:08:40,566
Scott: Regardless, usually when you get these congressional hearings, you have, you know, there's like a direct opposition.

132
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:48,537
Scott: So whoever is bearing witness is getting, you know, softball, easy questions, getting their ass kissed by one side, like, hey, Mr.

133
00:08:48,578 --> 00:08:51,547
Rym: White supremacist, why is it true that you are not, in fact, a threat?

134
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,393
Scott: Yeah, stuff like that.

135
00:08:54,557 --> 00:08:59,477
Scott: And the other side will be like, you know, you know, trying to tear into them and give them a hard time.

136
00:08:59,537 --> 00:08:59,718
Scott: Right.

137
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:15,707
Scott: And you see this not even just at, you know, things like this where you're talking to CEOs, but even like when they get, you know, potential new judges in and they're questioning them to see if they're going to be fit to be a judge.

138
00:09:15,808 --> 00:09:23,134
Scott: You know, it's like, well, you know, if it's a Republican judge, the Republicans are like, oh, how great a judge are you?

139
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:25,704
Scott: Are you the greatest or just a little less great than that?

140
00:09:25,764 --> 00:09:25,985
Scott: Right.

141
00:09:26,347 --> 00:09:27,994
Scott: And it's the same the other way, too.

142
00:09:28,054 --> 00:09:28,215
Scott: Right.

143
00:09:28,255 --> 00:09:29,962
Scott: If a Democratic judge is coming in there.

144
00:09:30,042 --> 00:09:30,243
Scott: Right.

145
00:09:30,263 --> 00:09:32,952
Scott: The Democrats are like, oh, how great a judge are you?

146
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:33,514
Scott: Anyway, so.

147
00:09:33,534 --> 00:09:36,503
Scott: But you get to see.

148
00:09:37,044 --> 00:09:37,365
Scott: Right.

149
00:09:38,066 --> 00:09:38,708
Scott: Tim Apple.

150
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:40,833
Scott: Right.

151
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:43,520
Rym: I will never not laugh at the Tim Apple joke.

152
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,422
Scott: Sundar Google.

153
00:09:45,843 --> 00:09:46,164
Scott: Right.

154
00:09:46,685 --> 00:09:47,687
Scott: Jeff Amazon.

155
00:09:47,707 --> 00:09:48,809
Scott: And.

156
00:09:49,471 --> 00:09:49,812
Scott: Right.

157
00:09:50,654 --> 00:09:51,215
Scott: Zuck face.

158
00:09:51,235 --> 00:09:51,896
Scott: The replicants.

159
00:09:51,956 --> 00:09:52,177
Rym: Right.

160
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:53,520
Scott: And Zuck face.

161
00:09:53,700 --> 00:10:01,069
Scott: So all four of those people, notice the Microsoft was not called in because Microsoft had to go through this ringer a long time ago.

162
00:10:01,129 --> 00:10:02,074
Scott: You should read up on that.

163
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:07,459
Scott: Someone actually commented on YouTube video like Bill Gates, happy he retired so he didn't have to go through this.

164
00:10:07,499 --> 00:10:09,687
Scott: And I replied, I'm like, he went through this.

165
00:10:10,971 --> 00:10:12,135
Scott: He was on trial even.

166
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:12,917
Scott: It was even worse.

167
00:10:13,178 --> 00:10:15,306
Rym: And it was a different situation back then.

168
00:10:15,326 --> 00:10:25,804
Rym: And not to get into it, but I think a lot of the anti-trust actions against Microsoft were badly misplaced based on Congress knowing as little as you think they know about technology.

169
00:10:25,844 --> 00:10:26,065
Rym: They knew.

170
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:26,910
Scott: They still know.

171
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:28,236
Scott: They still know a little about.

172
00:10:28,276 --> 00:10:28,417
Scott: But

173
00:10:28,457 --> 00:10:31,690
Rym: back then during the Microsoft antitrust, regardless,

174
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:52,792
Scott: though, there was still the fundamental point was that regardless of the other details in the case at the time, Microsoft was using its Windows platform monopoly to gain unfair advantage in other non-operating system markets, which is an anti-trust violation of law that still exists.

175
00:10:52,992 --> 00:10:53,213
Scott: Right.

176
00:10:53,715 --> 00:10:58,008
Scott: Even though our antitrust law is weak, that is still a violation of the weak ass law we have.

177
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:09,223
Scott: And all four of the companies whose CEOs were being called on in this hearing as witnesses are guilty of the exact same thing and many, many other things.

178
00:11:10,407 --> 00:11:15,467
Scott: But what was interesting was that usually you have this opposition where one side is ass kissing and one side is grilling.

179
00:11:16,169 --> 00:11:18,317
Scott: Both sides were grilling for different reasons.

180
00:11:18,999 --> 00:11:19,220
Scott: Right.

181
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,269
Scott: One side was grilling for, I guess.

182
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:26,102
Scott: actually some of the Republicans didn't go to conspiracy theory land, but some did.

183
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:41,509
Scott: One of them did ask his and that for only one time, though, which is the worst part of the whole thing, like even the white supremacy parts were not as bad as that part, because at least these guys were getting grilled.

184
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:45,544
Scott: So it's like to see four of the most powerful people on earth.

185
00:11:45,825 --> 00:11:46,066
Scott: Right.

186
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:47,712
Scott: The wealthiest people imaginable.

187
00:11:48,194 --> 00:11:48,455
Scott: Right.

188
00:11:48,716 --> 00:11:51,385
Scott: In control of the largest companies on earth.

189
00:11:51,406 --> 00:11:53,674
Rym: Congress could just like take away their fortunes.

190
00:11:54,858 --> 00:11:55,440
Scott: Yeah, they could.

191
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:58,750
Rym: Like Congress does ultimately have power over these four people.

192
00:11:59,593 --> 00:11:59,834
Scott: Right.

193
00:12:00,235 --> 00:12:01,178
Scott: Being grilled.

194
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:01,820
Scott: Right.

195
00:12:02,261 --> 00:12:05,655
Scott: Regardless of whether the intentions of that grilling were good or bad.

196
00:12:05,756 --> 00:12:05,976
Scott: Right.

197
00:12:06,338 --> 00:12:08,325
Scott: They did not have a good moment.

198
00:12:09,148 --> 00:12:09,349
Scott: Right.

199
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:12,700
Scott: But there were, you know, there were some definite highlights here.

200
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:21,045
Scott: If you don't want to watch the whole six hour hearing, even though you could fast forward a political answers.

201
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:21,346
Scott: Right.

202
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:22,612
Scott: I'll look into that for you.

203
00:12:22,652 --> 00:12:24,500
Scott: My office will get back to you on that.

204
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,562
Scott: I don't want, right.

205
00:12:25,602 --> 00:12:26,385
Scott: That sort of thing.

206
00:12:26,986 --> 00:12:27,227
Scott: Right.

207
00:12:27,508 --> 00:12:33,045
Scott: But there were some notable highlights to be seen that are worth checking out.

208
00:12:33,326 --> 00:12:43,305
Scott: You should definitely see the closing statement of, you know, the chairman where he's just like, yep, some of these companies should be broken up and others, all of them should be regulated heavily.

209
00:12:43,325 --> 00:12:44,007
Scott: Right.

210
00:12:45,452 --> 00:12:49,002
Scott: He's just like, like his conclusion was just like, F you, how are you?

211
00:12:49,022 --> 00:12:59,706
Scott: I think Tim Apple got off a little easy because a, his company actually is less of a monopoly than the others.

212
00:12:59,867 --> 00:13:00,088
Scott: Right.

213
00:13:00,148 --> 00:13:00,369
Scott: Is like.

214
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:05,829
Scott: the only real thing that can go on after him for, in terms of antitrust is the app store.

215
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:06,431
Scott: Right.

216
00:13:06,511 --> 00:13:07,695
Scott: With his 30% cut.

217
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:09,200
Scott: Like what else does Apple do?

218
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,143
Scott: That's a monopoly.

219
00:13:10,544 --> 00:13:15,539
Scott: They're just really big, but they in no way control any market.

220
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:19,053
Rym: What besides they control the market of people who have iPhones.

221
00:13:19,755 --> 00:13:20,016
Scott: Yeah.

222
00:13:20,117 --> 00:13:23,794
Scott: That's it's like they, they don't get, you know, it's like, like they don't control me.

223
00:13:23,854 --> 00:13:25,000
Rym: I got an Android phone here.

224
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:25,401
Scott: Right.

225
00:13:25,461 --> 00:13:29,537
Scott: Facebook's out there buying up Instagrams, buying up WhatsApps, right.

226
00:13:29,598 --> 00:13:33,510
Scott: Doing, you know, antitrust obvious, you know, antitrust violations, right.

227
00:13:34,012 --> 00:13:37,785
Scott: Amazon, you know, you could go, oh my God, you can't even begin with them.

228
00:13:37,805 --> 00:13:38,708
Scott: Right.

229
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:41,319
Scott: And of course, Google just using their power.

230
00:13:41,379 --> 00:13:45,112
Scott: The fact that they completely own search to then control everything else.

231
00:13:45,293 --> 00:13:45,533
Scott: Right.

232
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:48,925
Scott: YouTube advertising and phones and this and that.

233
00:13:49,406 --> 00:14:00,084
Scott: Um, I was disappointed that nobody, when they were questioning them, I don't know if there's maybe a rule against this when they were questioning them, they didn't pit them against each other at all.

234
00:14:00,365 --> 00:14:00,626
Scott: Right.

235
00:14:00,987 --> 00:14:06,482
Scott: So for example, right, they were asking, um, like, uh, who were they asking?

236
00:14:06,543 --> 00:14:14,232
Scott: Oh, they were asking, uh, Facebook about some apps that Facebook had that were banned from the Apple app store for being privacy invading.

237
00:14:14,733 --> 00:14:14,994
Scott: Right.

238
00:14:15,536 --> 00:14:20,314
Scott: And I'm like, and they're asking Zuckerberg about his apps that got banned from the Apple app store.

239
00:14:21,077 --> 00:14:22,402
Scott: But Tim Apple's right there.

240
00:14:23,164 --> 00:14:28,260
Scott: Ask Tim Apple about Facebook's apps and why he banned them from the app store.

241
00:14:28,781 --> 00:14:29,062
Scott: Right.

242
00:14:29,444 --> 00:14:35,669
Scott: Why they didn't ask Jeff Bezos about how, you know, when they're grilling Tim Apple about how come he's taken a cut on all the apps.

243
00:14:36,211 --> 00:14:37,557
Scott: Why don't you have Jeff Bezos?

244
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:38,259
Scott: Who's right there?

245
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:44,371
Scott: Because his Kindle app, you can't buy a Kindle book in the Kindle app on the app store because he doesn't want to let Tim Apple take a 30% cut.

246
00:14:44,392 --> 00:14:49,825
Rym: Well, what do you want, you want the sergeant of arms to walk over there and put a knife in the middle of the room and then they will be instructed in what to do.

247
00:14:49,845 --> 00:14:53,925
Scott: Well, they were all the witnesses and a couple of the Congress people were on video.

248
00:14:54,146 --> 00:14:54,247
Rym: Right.

249
00:14:54,287 --> 00:14:56,615
Rym: I saw people critiquing their backdrops.

250
00:14:57,077 --> 00:15:01,308
Scott: Which was notably Cisco WebEx and the CEO of Cisco was not there.

251
00:15:03,273 --> 00:15:05,560
Rym: I mean, Juniper, Juniper competes with Cisco.

252
00:15:06,081 --> 00:15:12,078
Scott: They were not using it, but they were not using FaceTime or Google Meets or right.

253
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:22,394
Scott: But yeah, there was also the, my favorite part was when they asked about whether China steals technologies from US companies and everyone gave a wishy washy answer.

254
00:15:22,896 --> 00:15:27,732
Scott: and piece of shit, Zuckface who gave shitty answers to everything else.

255
00:15:28,454 --> 00:15:32,129
Scott: This one question, which is asked by a white supremacist, by the way, right.

256
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:34,400
Scott: He asked the question for xenophobic and racist reasons.

257
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:35,423
Scott: Asked in bad faith.

258
00:15:36,045 --> 00:15:36,285
Scott: Right.

259
00:15:36,566 --> 00:15:38,693
Scott: But the question is a legitimate one.

260
00:15:38,733 --> 00:15:45,357
Scott: Do you think or know of China, Chinese government stealing technology from US companies, which they absolutely do.

261
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:45,959
Scott: Right.

262
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,031
Scott: They don't respect the intellectual property laws of any other country.

263
00:15:49,132 --> 00:15:49,313
Scott: Right.

264
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:54,573
Scott: And whether those laws should be respected is another question entirely, but do they steal?

265
00:15:54,613 --> 00:15:55,095
Scott: Yes, they do.

266
00:15:55,918 --> 00:15:58,770
Scott: Tim Apple, whose factories are in China, gave the wishy washy answer.

267
00:15:59,292 --> 00:15:59,534
Scott: Right.

268
00:16:00,116 --> 00:16:02,927
Scott: Google, who hopes to do business there, give the wishy washy answer.

269
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:04,593
Scott: Right.

270
00:16:05,074 --> 00:16:07,683
Scott: Jeff Bezos said, yeah, I heard of it, but it's never happened to me.

271
00:16:07,703 --> 00:16:08,686
Scott: Right.

272
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:10,412
Scott: I don't know any specific instances.

273
00:16:10,693 --> 00:16:11,194
Rym: Okay.

274
00:16:11,756 --> 00:16:17,838
Scott: And Zuckface says, it is, I believe it is a well-recorded and well-established fact that they do it.

275
00:16:17,878 --> 00:16:19,144
Scott: And I'm like, thank you.

276
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:21,719
Scott: That's the only good thing I've heard you say in your whole life.

277
00:16:22,161 --> 00:16:25,069
Scott: Why couldn't you answer every other question that exact same way?

278
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:25,952
Scott: You coward.

279
00:16:27,797 --> 00:16:29,142
Scott: So you should watch it for that.

280
00:16:29,764 --> 00:16:30,728
Scott: Um, and there you go.

281
00:16:30,748 --> 00:16:44,293
Scott: But yeah, this, uh, this is maybe the best congressional hearing I've watched since, uh, there were like those IP hearings back in the day where like, uh, you know, Zoe Lofgren was, uh, giving them the grill, right.

282
00:16:44,574 --> 00:16:46,280
Scott: SISPA business back in those days.

283
00:16:46,621 --> 00:16:46,801
Scott: Right.

284
00:16:47,002 --> 00:16:48,449
Rym: I've seen a few good ones over time.

285
00:16:49,072 --> 00:16:49,293
Scott: Yeah.

286
00:16:49,414 --> 00:16:50,600
Scott: There's, there's good ones out there.

287
00:16:50,962 --> 00:16:55,683
Scott: Uh, and if you really, if you like this kind of action and you don't want to watch it for six hours, right.

288
00:16:55,703 --> 00:17:03,867
Scott: I suggest what you do is go and find the YouTube channels or social media accounts of your favorite Congress people.

289
00:17:04,328 --> 00:17:04,489
Scott: Right.

290
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:07,359
Rym: They will push clips of themselves having good moments.

291
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,184
Scott: My favorite, you know, everyone loves AOC, but my favorite is actually, she's my, I mean, she's up there right.

292
00:17:12,223 --> 00:17:13,028
Scott: Top five easy.

293
00:17:13,108 --> 00:17:13,269
Scott: Right.

294
00:17:13,631 --> 00:17:15,420
Scott: But Katie Porter is actually my favorite.

295
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:21,704
Scott: If you go and look at Katie Porter's YouTube channel, all she posts is videos of her grilling the shit.

296
00:17:21,786 --> 00:17:24,497
Scott: I was disappointed she was not here to grill these four people.

297
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:26,041
Scott: Right.

298
00:17:26,061 --> 00:17:28,490
Scott: Cause man, she really, she nails them good.

299
00:17:28,751 --> 00:17:30,759
Scott: Um, and yeah, so that's my news.

300
00:17:30,859 --> 00:17:31,662
Scott: This is big deal.

301
00:17:32,124 --> 00:17:35,177
Scott: It's uh, it's Monday stuff, but you know, I'll put it on Thursday.

302
00:17:35,317 --> 00:17:35,518
Scott: Yep.

303
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:44,700
Rym: I actually have a Monday news around a specific instance of China stealing data from American companies, but I want to save her for Monday because I want to talk about the exploit specifically.

304
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:45,761
Scott: Ooh.

305
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:49,090
Rym: It's uh, it's an interesting story about a tax app.

306
00:17:50,614 --> 00:17:51,276
Rym: I got a cute up.

307
00:17:51,918 --> 00:17:52,500
Rym: one last news.

308
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,222
Rym: If you didn't notice.

309
00:17:53,784 --> 00:17:58,759
Rym: Uh, so it turns out Donald Trump, our president killed Herman Cain indirectly.

310
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:03,717
Rym: He had a rally, you know, during the pandemic and encourage people to not wear masks.

311
00:18:04,038 --> 00:18:08,889
Rym: Herman Cain appears to have gotten the coronavirus at that rally and is now dead.

312
00:18:08,909 --> 00:18:31,282
Rym: I don't know what else I think is going to keep happening because there has been a sort in America where generally conservatives are resisting wearing masks and taking basic precautions and non-conservatives are wearing masks and taking basic precautions and we're seeing this start to affect our electoral politics.

313
00:18:32,346 --> 00:18:34,272
Scott: Well, I'm really curious, right?

314
00:18:34,452 --> 00:18:37,282
Scott: You know, it's like I would like it if people stopped dying.

315
00:18:37,342 --> 00:18:38,305
Scott: That would be ideal.

316
00:18:39,068 --> 00:18:46,055
Rym: But what if America decides on its own that only a certain like a subset of the population will die at a much higher rate by their own choice?

317
00:18:46,156 --> 00:18:54,486
Scott: But the problem is, from what I've seen statistically, it's that people with less money are more likely to get COVID-19 and die and be unwell.

318
00:18:55,268 --> 00:19:06,383
Scott: Uh, so I'm really curious, is it, is the disease killing more poor left-leaning people or is it killing more right-leaning people who refuse to wear masks and take precautions?

319
00:19:06,825 --> 00:19:14,552
Rym: Well, masks and precautions, all the polls and studies I see seem to indicate that non-white people comply way more than white people do.

320
00:19:14,893 --> 00:19:17,423
Rym: Liberals comply way more than conservatives.

321
00:19:17,463 --> 00:19:19,855
Rym: But do they, urban people comply way more than rural people.

322
00:19:19,895 --> 00:19:20,780
Scott: But do they die less?

323
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:25,351
Scott: Well, it's it, the, the people who are complying more have less money.

324
00:19:25,371 --> 00:19:26,014
Scott: Yep.

325
00:19:26,495 --> 00:19:33,882
Rym: But if they live in a place where there's more compliance, they are safer than if they lived in a place with less compliance.

326
00:19:34,284 --> 00:19:36,131
Scott: But those places also have more people.

327
00:19:36,372 --> 00:19:36,593
Scott: Yep.

328
00:19:36,834 --> 00:19:42,895
Rym: But look, we're seeing New York, an extremely dense city, has vanishingly few cases day by day.

329
00:19:42,935 --> 00:19:43,718
Rym: now compared to...

330
00:19:43,738 --> 00:19:45,425
Scott: It's still like hundreds.

331
00:19:45,445 --> 00:19:45,786
Scott: Yeah.

332
00:19:45,806 --> 00:19:48,458
Rym: A few hundred in a city of so many million compared to...

333
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:49,924
Scott: It's not, it's still not great.

334
00:19:50,145 --> 00:19:50,346
Scott: Yeah.

335
00:19:50,447 --> 00:19:51,713
Rym: I think there, there are 290 yesterday in the whole city.

336
00:19:53,922 --> 00:19:55,329
Scott: You want to go ride the subway to work?

337
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:58,303
Rym: Oh no, I'm not going back to work until like, we're next.

338
00:19:58,384 --> 00:20:00,936
Rym: July is like the earliest date that's even been talked about.

339
00:20:00,956 --> 00:20:03,932
Scott: One of my coworkers went to my office today and I was like, hey, how's my desk do it?

340
00:20:04,173 --> 00:20:05,339
Scott: I was like, hey, how's my desk do it?

341
00:20:06,003 --> 00:20:08,877
Rym: Like, I don't think I'm going to go back to my office in 2021 the way things are going.

342
00:20:10,101 --> 00:20:11,045
Scott: I don't think so either.

343
00:20:11,105 --> 00:20:11,406
Scott: Yeah.

344
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:23,446
Rym: But anyway, on a much lighter note, it is time for the things of the day.

345
00:20:23,466 --> 00:20:24,951
Rym: This is a real short video.

346
00:20:25,071 --> 00:20:31,171
Rym: It's 37 seconds long, but it is a sound that is, you are very unlikely to hear.

347
00:20:31,192 --> 00:20:38,535
Rym: And it's a sound that if you do hear it, you are probably involved in a very, very bad situation.

348
00:20:39,377 --> 00:20:45,713
Rym: It is the sound that a giant turbine engine makes if you drop a screw into it.

349
00:20:46,656 --> 00:20:55,143
Rym: Oh, this is a turbine engine that they have cut off of something and cut the shaft out of, uh, for like, like a jet engine, uh, basically.

350
00:20:55,163 --> 00:20:55,444
Rym: Yeah.

351
00:20:55,926 --> 00:20:56,127
Rym: Yeah.

352
00:20:56,308 --> 00:20:57,834
Rym: And they've got to just lay in there.

353
00:20:57,855 --> 00:21:07,035
Scott: I think it's like, if you were flying it, so if you were flying in an airplane and you heard this noise, that means a screw just is in the air somehow flying, got into the front of the engine.

354
00:21:07,236 --> 00:21:13,319
Rym: Well, this is the sound it makes if the turbines not spinning, like you're working on doing maintenance and you drop a screw into it.

355
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:14,743
Scott: It is.

356
00:21:14,883 --> 00:21:17,290
Rym: It does not make the sound you think it would make.

357
00:21:17,571 --> 00:21:21,322
Rym: I was very surprised by what this sounded like.

358
00:21:21,402 --> 00:21:31,960
Scott: And also my, my guess would be something like a, like a date, like a ding, but then the ding would resonate like, and they become like, you know, I thought something similar.

359
00:21:32,402 --> 00:21:33,388
Rym: I was completely wrong.

360
00:21:33,428 --> 00:21:34,313
Rym: I'm not even going to spoil it.

361
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:41,467
Rym: The video is 37 seconds long, but the best part is the guy in the video is like, yeah, if you ever hear this sound, you're about to have a real bad day.

362
00:21:41,488 --> 00:21:43,961
Scott: Don't turn the engine as long as you don't turn the engine on.

363
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:44,364
Rym: Oh yeah.

364
00:21:44,464 --> 00:21:46,437
Rym: But basically there's no way to get that screw out of there.

365
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:47,141
Rym: Like you're just fucked.

366
00:21:47,201 --> 00:21:49,169
Rym: You just cause millions of dollars.

367
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:50,333
Scott: You take it apart.

368
00:21:50,453 --> 00:21:56,114
Scott: That's expensive and difficult and time consuming, but you can do it depending on the magnet.

369
00:21:56,174 --> 00:21:59,645
Scott: magnet magnet can also help you depending on the turbine.

370
00:22:00,086 --> 00:22:02,272
Rym: Some cannot be taken apart.

371
00:22:02,473 --> 00:22:05,080
Rym: They must be cut apart, destroying them.

372
00:22:06,861 --> 00:22:08,148
Scott: Why would you make something like that?

373
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:11,464
Rym: Uh, depending on what that, how was it made?

374
00:22:11,765 --> 00:22:13,371
Scott: Everything that's made can be unmade.

375
00:22:13,673 --> 00:22:15,520
Rym: Imagine here's, here's that analogy.

376
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:23,632
Rym: There are fancy suits and dresses that are used for special occasions where you are sewn into them and they cannot be removed except by cutting.

377
00:22:23,994 --> 00:22:27,947
Rym: And to put them back on requires being tailored and re-sewn.

378
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:31,055
Scott: Yeah, but you can still tailor it.

379
00:22:31,075 --> 00:22:43,280
Rym: You could rebuild the thing, but sometimes a piece might be forged or cast in one piece where there is no way to access the internal parts of it because of you need it to be one piece for its own materials.

380
00:22:44,081 --> 00:22:45,570
Scott: Well, how would the screw get in there?

381
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:51,774
Scott: then if it's one piece, if there's an opening in the front, there's an opening, then you can use a little, uh, you know, what's that?

382
00:22:51,874 --> 00:22:53,521
Scott: The arthroscopic surgery, right?

383
00:22:53,702 --> 00:22:55,949
Rym: Yeah, you may be able to, it depends.

384
00:22:57,434 --> 00:23:06,726
Rym: Anyway, this video will tell you what that, you will hear what this sounds like because the dude just drops a screw into a turbine and you will be surprised by the sound.

385
00:23:06,746 --> 00:23:08,452
Scott: All right.

386
00:23:08,472 --> 00:23:12,850
Scott: So my thing of the day, so in Japan, there was a television show called Mito Koman.

387
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:17,430
Scott: I don't know how to, I don't know if I'm pronouncing it correctly, but it was one of those period dramas, right?

388
00:23:17,471 --> 00:23:19,921
Scott: That took place in like, you know, olden times, right?

389
00:23:19,962 --> 00:23:25,322
Scott: And it actually ran for an insanely long period of time from like the late sixties to like 2011.

390
00:23:25,322 --> 00:23:26,165
Scott: I think the show ended.

391
00:23:26,225 --> 00:23:27,450
Scott: It's what Wikipedia says.

392
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:34,150
Scott: Anyway, this is like a super popular long running, you know, TV, TV drama that was in prime time.

393
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,096
Scott: Um, big, big deal.

394
00:23:36,116 --> 00:23:40,054
Scott: Uh, but obviously anyone who's not from Japan probably wouldn't know or care about it.

395
00:23:40,114 --> 00:23:41,663
Scott: I've never watched an episode, right?

396
00:23:41,703 --> 00:23:42,547
Scott: I don't know what it's like.

397
00:23:42,607 --> 00:23:44,155
Scott: I just know what exists and what its name is.

398
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:49,796
Rym: Um, I'm watching any live action thing that I've never watched from like older Japan.

399
00:23:49,856 --> 00:23:52,065
Rym: I'm watching like Odorodai Sousa-sen.

400
00:23:52,788 --> 00:23:53,190
Scott: Exactly.

401
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,054
Scott: This is way older than that.

402
00:23:54,114 --> 00:23:54,677
Scott: Oh, I guess not.

403
00:23:54,717 --> 00:23:56,503
Scott: I guess it's both older and newer.

404
00:23:56,663 --> 00:23:57,265
Scott: Yeah.

405
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:02,097
Scott: Uh, anyway, so what I do know about, right?

406
00:24:02,237 --> 00:24:04,363
Rym: Is that, oh, this is Neil Nadelman's YouTube channel.

407
00:24:05,005 --> 00:24:05,245
Scott: Yeah.

408
00:24:05,346 --> 00:24:06,609
Scott: In the year 1991, right?

409
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:11,023
Scott: Uh, a student at an art school made student film.

410
00:24:11,043 --> 00:24:14,998
Scott: Uh, and the student film is Godzilla versus Mito Koman, right?

411
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:16,663
Scott: So it was basically the.

412
00:24:16,743 --> 00:24:17,626
Scott: it's about right.

413
00:24:17,686 --> 00:24:22,240
Scott: Godzilla fighting, you know, Mito Koman from that TV show, right?

414
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:34,742
Scott: In case you don't know who Mito Koman is, uh, now you know, and the thing about this student film is that the person in the film who is, uh, basically doing everything, this one student, what's his name?

415
00:24:34,863 --> 00:24:35,886
Scott: The name is in the description.

416
00:24:35,987 --> 00:24:36,890
Scott: Shinya Takashita.

417
00:24:37,312 --> 00:24:40,605
Scott: This guy did absolutely everything in the film.

418
00:24:40,685 --> 00:24:42,152
Scott: Directed the film, right?

419
00:24:42,192 --> 00:24:43,498
Scott: Shot the film, right?

420
00:24:43,538 --> 00:24:46,127
Scott: As a student, he wrote the film, did everything, right?

421
00:24:46,348 --> 00:24:49,500
Scott: Including acting as every single character in the film.

422
00:24:50,242 --> 00:25:04,407
Scott: And not only the characters like Godzilla and Mito Koman and Mito Koman's followers that you would expect, but also as characters such as the power lines that Godzilla grabs onto or gets thrown into and things of that nature.

423
00:25:04,988 --> 00:25:07,155
Scott: Um, it's only 11 minutes long.

424
00:25:07,175 --> 00:25:08,760
Scott: I hope he got an A on this.

425
00:25:09,221 --> 00:25:12,173
Scott: It is a legendary, um, it's not anything new.

426
00:25:12,394 --> 00:25:15,085
Scott: It's just something that's new to, I think, a lot of nerds out there.

427
00:25:15,607 --> 00:25:21,373
Scott: I've known about it for quite a while and I was just digging through my YouTubes and I was like, hey, here's the thing of the day.

428
00:25:21,975 --> 00:25:22,940
Scott: People probably haven't seen this.

429
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,745
Scott: We didn't use it as thing of the day before.

430
00:25:25,528 --> 00:25:25,950
Scott: Check it out.

431
00:25:26,612 --> 00:25:27,134
Rym: Pretty cool.

432
00:25:28,017 --> 00:25:33,422
Rym: In the meta moment, the Book Club book's kind of on hold because we don't really have time to read during this quarantine.

433
00:25:33,462 --> 00:25:34,125
Rym: Like we're stuck at home.

434
00:25:34,145 --> 00:25:35,008
Rym: We're not traveling.

435
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:36,152
Scott: Yep.

436
00:25:37,297 --> 00:25:38,601
Rym: Ah, we're playing a lot of train games.

437
00:25:38,903 --> 00:25:39,685
Rym: Follow me.

438
00:25:40,006 --> 00:25:42,656
Rym: Follow Scott on YouTube and all the other places.

439
00:25:42,676 --> 00:25:44,624
Rym: we're doing stuff because we keep doing stuff.

440
00:25:44,845 --> 00:25:48,862
Rym: We're trying to do the stuff that we can do from home without having to go out anywhere.

441
00:25:48,882 --> 00:25:52,331
Scott: I don't know.

442
00:25:52,431 --> 00:25:54,136
Rym: I got, yeah, I got nothing else.

443
00:25:54,377 --> 00:26:00,241
Scott: I guess we could just list off in case for some reason someone listening to this does not know every place you can find us on the internet.

444
00:26:00,522 --> 00:26:02,610
Scott: There is our website, frontrowcrew.com.

445
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:05,260
Scott: There is a forum at community.frontrowcrew.com.

446
00:26:05,601 --> 00:26:07,610
Scott: There is a forum at forum.frontrowcrew.com.

447
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:11,586
Scott: that is read only that preceded the current forum at community.frontrowcrew.com.

448
00:26:12,068 --> 00:26:13,814
Scott: There are three Twitter accounts.

449
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:16,344
Scott: My Rym, my Twitter rims, Twitter, GeekNights, Twitter.

450
00:26:16,907 --> 00:26:19,559
Scott: There is a Facebook page that I don't, it barely works.

451
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:21,287
Scott: I don't know if anyone goes to it, but it exists.

452
00:26:21,347 --> 00:26:21,468
Scott: Yeah.

453
00:26:21,508 --> 00:26:22,593
Rym: Delete your Facebook accounts.

454
00:26:22,855 --> 00:26:25,041
Scott: We have a GeekNights Instagram.

455
00:26:25,402 --> 00:26:26,264
Scott: That's also Facebook.

456
00:26:27,969 --> 00:26:29,132
Scott: I have an Instagram.

457
00:26:30,737 --> 00:26:32,662
Scott: They're not posted to very often, they exist.

458
00:26:33,786 --> 00:26:36,635
Scott: We have a discord server that you can join.

459
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:37,699
Rym: It's moderately rocking.

460
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:38,823
Rym: There's stuff going on in there.

461
00:26:40,168 --> 00:26:41,894
Scott: We have, I guess, the stupid Patreon.

462
00:26:41,914 --> 00:26:42,878
Scott: Don't give Rym any money.

463
00:26:42,918 --> 00:26:45,309
Scott: Give your Rym money to something worth giving money to.

464
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:47,802
Rym: But that's where there's sideshows, which you don't have to pay for.

465
00:26:47,823 --> 00:26:49,330
Rym: They're mostly public, those things.

466
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:53,388
Rym: Me and Emily are reviewing every Disney theatrical animation in chronological order.

467
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:54,111
Scott: Okay.

468
00:26:54,493 --> 00:26:55,557
Scott: I have a YouTube channel.

469
00:26:55,617 --> 00:26:56,621
Rym: It's my YouTube channel.

470
00:26:56,802 --> 00:26:58,990
Rym: The three Caballeros and Saludos Amigos.

471
00:26:59,593 --> 00:27:03,951
Scott: I know a Rym has a YouTube channel, which is also the official GeekNights YouTube channel.

472
00:27:04,031 --> 00:27:07,407
Rym: So like all our panels and like mainstream stuff is there plus my bullshit.

473
00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:15,560
Rym: And then Scott's YouTube channel is some of our other shows, Scott's bullshit and like other side content that randomly will stream with Scott instead of mine.

474
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:19,917
Scott: There is an actual GeekNights YouTube channel that I have regained access to.

475
00:27:20,018 --> 00:27:21,725
Scott: That's like youtube.com/geeknight.

476
00:27:21,745 --> 00:27:25,177
Rym: The problem is all our subscribers are on my channel.

477
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:25,659
Scott: Yeah.

478
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:31,823
Scott: We lost access to it for so long and I don't, we would need someone at Google to like help us merge, merge them somehow.

479
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:32,404
Scott: Yeah.

480
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:37,735
Scott: I've been streaming Paper Mario on Twitch.

481
00:27:38,697 --> 00:27:39,098
Scott: Oh yeah.

482
00:27:39,138 --> 00:27:39,840
Scott: Paper Mario.

483
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,763
Scott: I'm probably going to do that again soon.

484
00:27:41,844 --> 00:27:42,425
Rym: I'll finish it.

485
00:27:42,445 --> 00:27:51,393
Scott: There is, there's gotta be, oh, there's a GeekNights newsletter that you can subscribe to.

486
00:27:51,453 --> 00:27:55,591
Scott: that is mailed a few times a year, maybe whenever I remember and put it.

487
00:27:55,631 --> 00:27:56,153
Scott: enough effort.

488
00:27:56,194 --> 00:27:57,098
Scott: Cause it's it's work.

489
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:01,977
Rym: Oh, and the Baltimore and Ohio railroad just IPO'd at one 50.

490
00:28:01,977 --> 00:28:02,479
Scott: Well, okay.

491
00:28:02,499 --> 00:28:03,985
Scott: Well, I mean, that's what's going to happen.

492
00:28:04,005 --> 00:28:06,053
Rym: I gotta, I gotta think about if I want to IPO IC.

493
00:28:06,073 --> 00:28:07,539
Scott: Okay, go ahead.

494
00:28:08,201 --> 00:28:09,689
Scott: Anyway, we're playing games still.

495
00:28:10,011 --> 00:28:11,580
Scott: You should, you should find us on the internet.

496
00:28:12,661 --> 00:28:14,148
Rym: All right, let's get into it.

497
00:28:14,429 --> 00:28:16,960
Rym: Power tools, completely nice generic topic.

498
00:28:18,061 --> 00:28:34,450
Scott: I guess, uh, you know, the thing is as like, as much as I have used power tools enough to do an episode on them, I primarily avoid power tools and we'll use handheld tools unless a power tool is like necessary.

499
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:38,541
Rym: I prefer power tools and almost all cases for almost all things.

500
00:28:38,903 --> 00:28:56,135
Rym: But now that I live in apartment, I use them less because I tend to not do the kinds of projects I would do previously, but I still use power tools pretty much exclusively for anything I would do with tools, unless it's a really, really trivial job.

501
00:28:56,215 --> 00:28:57,420
Rym: Like tighten a screw.

502
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:58,982
Scott: Yeah.

503
00:28:59,022 --> 00:28:59,203
Scott: Yeah.

504
00:28:59,584 --> 00:29:02,016
Scott: But like sometimes they're tightening a screw and it just won't tighten.

505
00:29:02,257 --> 00:29:04,025
Scott: I have a power screwdriver I'll use.

506
00:29:04,306 --> 00:29:04,547
Scott: Right.

507
00:29:04,828 --> 00:29:05,149
Scott: Yeah.

508
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:09,690
Rym: But like, cause I like a nice torque setting so I can choose like exactly how tight I want the screw to be.

509
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:12,825
Scott: It's like, if I can screw it in by hand, I'll screw it in by hand.

510
00:29:12,906 --> 00:29:18,269
Scott: But the only other time I'll reach for the power screwdriver is like, okay, I've got to screw in 30 screws.

511
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:21,342
Scott: I guess I'm not doing them all by hand, even if I could do one by hand.

512
00:29:21,382 --> 00:29:21,563
Scott: Yeah.

513
00:29:21,603 --> 00:29:24,374
Rym: But even for a single screw often I'll use a power tool.

514
00:29:24,414 --> 00:29:30,499
Rym: because of the consistency and the like, I can make things like, I can get better tolerances in my work.

515
00:29:32,041 --> 00:29:33,729
Rym: Like I don't like the screw.

516
00:29:33,809 --> 00:29:41,404
Rym: It's like, if you're screwing something in, depending on the nature of the screw, if you're doing it by hand and you don't have a screw guide set up, then you might angle a little bit.

517
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:51,928
Rym: It might like wear out a little bit of the thread as you're creating it, depending on what, whether or not you drilled a pilot hole with a drill, I can just be like, perfect pilot hole, perfect screw.

518
00:29:51,948 --> 00:29:54,999
Scott: Well, I mean, you're not going to do a hand drill.

519
00:29:56,921 --> 00:29:57,323
Rym: Yeah.

520
00:29:57,343 --> 00:30:00,336
Rym: The only thing I would do with a hand, they do have hand drills, right?

521
00:30:00,356 --> 00:30:01,180
Scott: You crank it like this.

522
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:01,461
Scott: Yeah.

523
00:30:01,622 --> 00:30:02,406
Rym: I had one as a kid.

524
00:30:02,446 --> 00:30:05,924
Rym: I actually used it a lot because I was often doing work in a place where I didn't have power.

525
00:30:05,944 --> 00:30:07,510
Scott: Oh, okay.

526
00:30:07,611 --> 00:30:08,675
Rym: It was a giant pain in the ass.

527
00:30:08,695 --> 00:30:11,629
Rym: You like double crank it and it had this like brace around it.

528
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:12,373
Rym: I hated that thing.

529
00:30:12,997 --> 00:30:16,830
Scott: Well, I think it's like, if you think about other tools, not just hardware power tools, right?

530
00:30:17,272 --> 00:30:25,259
Scott: It's like, um, usually what you see is that if there is a more powerful tool, especially like computers, right?

531
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:32,687
Scott: More, it's like, even if you're doing a small job, it's like, well, the more powerful tool still is more efficient and does a better job, right?

532
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:34,113
Scott: Why would you use a weak tool?

533
00:30:34,695 --> 00:30:40,635
Scott: But when it comes to like the kind of, you know, hardware kind of work, constructiony work, right?

534
00:30:40,836 --> 00:30:42,481
Scott: Household repair type work.

535
00:30:43,103 --> 00:30:49,800
Scott: A lot of times the minimum power of the power tool is too strong for a more delicate work.

536
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,874
Scott: Like you would never use a power tool when you're working on your bicycle, like ever.

537
00:30:52,895 --> 00:30:53,638
Scott: Right.

538
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:53,980
Scott: Yep.

539
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,089
Scott: Because it would just screw the screw in too hard.

540
00:30:56,149 --> 00:31:06,042
Rym: Well, I've said, so I have seen, like, I watched my bike shop use a power screwdriver, but it was a power screwdriver that had a fancy torque system on the front.

541
00:31:06,062 --> 00:31:08,310
Rym: So it was basically just a powered torch.

542
00:31:08,953 --> 00:31:09,716
Scott: Sure, sure, sure.

543
00:31:09,736 --> 00:31:10,378
Rym: That's fine.

544
00:31:10,659 --> 00:31:15,196
Rym: But no, do not put your carbon fiber bike together with a power screwdriver.

545
00:31:15,216 --> 00:31:16,000
Rym: You're going to die.

546
00:31:17,201 --> 00:31:17,402
Scott: Yeah.

547
00:31:18,185 --> 00:31:24,613
Scott: Um, but yeah, it's just like, you know, there's, it's surprising how like, you know, in, it's like, you're like, oh, just more power.

548
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:24,733
Scott: Right.

549
00:31:24,753 --> 00:31:28,834
Scott: So for example, on a power tool, for example, we talked about this during kitchen appliances, right?

550
00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:29,940
Scott: But it's like my stand mixer.

551
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:39,551
Scott: It's like, there's not really any reason to mix by hand so much once you have the stand mixer or a bright, it's like, it's just even at it.

552
00:31:39,671 --> 00:31:41,879
Scott: Cause it has such a weak power setting.

553
00:31:41,979 --> 00:31:43,103
Scott: It's like, it can do everything.

554
00:31:43,425 --> 00:31:44,771
Rym: Well, that's a good power tool.

555
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:49,650
Rym: There are a lot of, like a lot of people have only ever experienced crappy power tools.

556
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:56,137
Rym: Like you go to, you go to Sears, not that Sears will exist much longer if it even still exists, but I don't think it does.

557
00:31:56,158 --> 00:31:56,941
Scott: I don't think it does either.

558
00:31:57,182 --> 00:32:00,695
Rym: You go as a kid, like you go to Sears and there's like a $20 power drill.

559
00:32:01,057 --> 00:32:04,672
Rym: That piece of shit is too powerful for anything you're going to do.

560
00:32:04,953 --> 00:32:05,796
Rym: And it's going to break.

561
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:08,366
Rym: If you do anything that actually requires power.

562
00:32:08,907 --> 00:32:17,737
Rym: But I just always think back to in middle school shop class in sixth grade, the dude who was running that class asked one question of the class.

563
00:32:17,757 --> 00:32:20,227
Rym: He gave us a test out like midway through the class.

564
00:32:20,408 --> 00:32:21,493
Rym: And this was going to be our grade.

565
00:32:21,854 --> 00:32:23,521
Rym: It only had one question on it.

566
00:32:23,982 --> 00:32:33,148
Rym: And the question was basically there is a cheap option for a tool like a $1, like the cheapest version of this tool that exists.

567
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:36,900
Rym: There's the, the $40 version you'd buy at like a Sears.

568
00:32:37,421 --> 00:32:38,846
Rym: And then there's the professional one.

569
00:32:39,288 --> 00:32:43,683
Rym: And the, on the question was just when would you use each one of these three tools?

570
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:49,782
Scott: I mean, the cheap one, if that's all I can afford and it's going to get the job done.

571
00:32:49,903 --> 00:32:50,103
Scott: Yep.

572
00:32:50,184 --> 00:32:59,014
Rym: If I'm going to do a job once, like if I need to buy a tool to like change the oil in a car once before I sell that car, I will buy the cheapest possible tool.

573
00:32:59,536 --> 00:33:03,669
Rym: If I hang stuff on my wall, like I don't hang things on my wall that often.

574
00:33:04,131 --> 00:33:06,478
Rym: I don't need a laser leveler.

575
00:33:06,498 --> 00:33:07,824
Rym: I can use the bubble.

576
00:33:07,924 --> 00:33:10,255
Rym: It'll be good enough because I'm not doing it that often.

577
00:33:10,737 --> 00:33:14,029
Rym: But if I was hanging stuff on my wall every day, I'd have a laser leveler.

578
00:33:14,049 --> 00:33:25,192
Rym: And I think about that a lot, kind of with chairs and everything else in my life, I either buy the cheapest thing that will do the job or I will buy the correct tool for the job.

579
00:33:25,433 --> 00:33:27,039
Rym: And I try to avoid anything in the middle.

580
00:33:28,702 --> 00:33:28,903
Scott: All right.

581
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:32,160
Scott: But yeah, so let's talk about specific power tools, right?

582
00:33:32,522 --> 00:33:33,740
Scott: What's your favorite power tool?

583
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,033
Scott: Well, I have a story about, uh, the nail gun.

584
00:33:37,254 --> 00:33:38,440
Scott: I got a nail gun story.

585
00:33:41,363 --> 00:33:46,023
Scott: So with the nail gun, if you don't know, it's, it's just like, it's like a hammer and nails all in one, right?

586
00:33:46,063 --> 00:33:54,593
Scott: You put nails in it, you push it up against something, you pull the trigger and it fires a nail into whatever you're pushed it up against.

587
00:33:54,613 --> 00:34:04,106
Rym: They're pretty much for, if you got a hammer in like a thousand nails, like if you're writing, like I've only ever used a nail gun in my life, roofing, never for any other task.

588
00:34:04,968 --> 00:34:14,639
Scott: So, uh, there was one time I was not part of the group at school that would put that we worked, did anything involving a drama or the school play.

589
00:34:15,181 --> 00:34:23,071
Scott: But one time I was in, uh, AutoCAD class and the teacher who taught the AutoCAD class was one of the shop teachers who was in charge of that.

590
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:34,271
Scott: And one time we just sort of left class, just like, I don't remember what the circumstances were, but like class just sort of casually ended, I think because the teacher was working on that instead.

591
00:34:34,732 --> 00:34:38,306
Scott: So we, so I went and I was just like, all right, you know, I'll hammer this.

592
00:34:38,327 --> 00:34:39,714
Scott: I think where they were making a boat.

593
00:34:40,397 --> 00:34:43,547
Scott: Um, what, what play has that shuffle off to Buffalo song in it?

594
00:34:44,931 --> 00:34:46,175
Scott: Ah, I'll Google it.

595
00:34:47,438 --> 00:34:49,406
Scott: Oh, you're going to, you're going to Google it.

596
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:50,168
Rym: 42nd street.

597
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:52,197
Scott: That was the school play that year, 42nd street.

598
00:34:53,242 --> 00:34:54,167
Scott: And they were making a big boat.

599
00:34:54,187 --> 00:34:55,373
Rym: I've never actually seen 42nd street.

600
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:55,775
Rym: I've seen clips.

601
00:34:57,641 --> 00:34:57,942
Scott: It's good.

602
00:34:58,082 --> 00:34:58,724
Scott: Yeah.

603
00:34:59,427 --> 00:35:03,400
Scott: So the, uh, there was a boat that they had to make for the set, right?

604
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:06,910
Scott: There people go up the stairs on the boat and there was like an upper deck, right?

605
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:11,984
Scott: You know, sort of situation anyway.

606
00:35:12,466 --> 00:35:23,301
Scott: So, uh, just hammering, you know, like the frame of the thing was existing already, but we were hammering, uh, just, you know, wooden boards to the panels onto the side of it.

607
00:35:23,341 --> 00:35:23,502
Scott: Right.

608
00:35:23,522 --> 00:35:25,451
Scott: So then it was solid and not just a wooden frame.

609
00:35:26,034 --> 00:35:28,764
Scott: And I was just using, you know, a hand hammer and nails.

610
00:35:28,844 --> 00:35:29,045
Scott: Right.

611
00:35:29,386 --> 00:35:33,519
Scott: And I was going very, very slowly, but, uh, I was doing okay.

612
00:35:34,281 --> 00:35:34,522
Scott: Right.

613
00:35:35,406 --> 00:35:36,572
Scott: And the teacher had a nail gun.

614
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:42,080
Scott: And then of course the teacher was the kind of teacher would fool around and like pull back the safety on the nail gun and just shoot nails around.

615
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:42,741
Rym: Yeah.

616
00:35:42,821 --> 00:35:43,745
Rym: That's always a good time.

617
00:35:44,487 --> 00:35:45,411
Scott: Not at anyone.

618
00:35:45,471 --> 00:35:45,652
Scott: Right.

619
00:35:45,752 --> 00:35:47,258
Scott: Obviously at other things.

620
00:35:47,439 --> 00:35:47,620
Scott: Right.

621
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,283
Scott: That wouldn't cause damage.

622
00:35:48,323 --> 00:35:51,199
Rym: My middle school shop teacher had a lot of, "Hey kids, watch this

623
00:35:53,242 --> 00:35:53,382
Rym: lessons."

624
00:35:53,402 --> 00:35:54,024
Rym: Yeah, exactly.

625
00:35:54,044 --> 00:35:55,208
Rym: Which were always super fun.

626
00:35:55,729 --> 00:35:55,990
Scott: Sure.

627
00:35:57,154 --> 00:36:00,810
Scott: Uh, you know, so then eventually, you know, I've been sitting there for a while.

628
00:36:00,911 --> 00:36:01,132
Scott: Right.

629
00:36:01,293 --> 00:36:03,144
Scott: And the shop teacher's just like, "All right, you're taking too

630
00:36:03,184 --> 00:36:03,426
Scott: long."

631
00:36:04,069 --> 00:36:05,719
Scott: He comes over with the nail gun.

632
00:36:05,739 --> 00:36:05,960
Scott: He's like,

633
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:07,401
Scott: "Finishes."

634
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:13,925
Scott: You know, basically what was going to take me probably another hour in, uh, less than a minute, the nail gun.

635
00:36:14,687 --> 00:36:16,974
Scott: Uh, but the nails that he put in, right.

636
00:36:17,014 --> 00:36:20,204
Scott: Where A, uh, the heads on the nails were smaller.

637
00:36:20,305 --> 00:36:22,294
Scott: So that could be a positive or a negative.

638
00:36:22,334 --> 00:36:24,162
Scott: I guess pulling them out would be harder.

639
00:36:24,464 --> 00:36:26,071
Scott: I don't know if that's true for all nail guns.

640
00:36:26,795 --> 00:36:28,682
Scott: Um, you know, when's the last time I used a nail gun?

641
00:36:28,742 --> 00:36:29,324
Scott: Probably then.

642
00:36:29,344 --> 00:36:30,127
Scott: The year 1998 or 99.

643
00:36:30,127 --> 00:36:30,227
Scott: Yeah.

644
00:36:30,247 --> 00:36:35,022
Scott: I was like 15 the last time I touched a nail gun.

645
00:36:35,042 --> 00:36:38,194
Scott: Uh, but it made them harder to see, but also harder to remove.

646
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:43,576
Scott: Obviously it was faster and easier, but also it was just sort of more haphazard, right.

647
00:36:43,616 --> 00:36:44,962
Scott: You know, it was like doing it by hand.

648
00:36:44,982 --> 00:36:49,096
Scott: I was putting them, spacing them more evenly, being more careful, right.

649
00:36:49,116 --> 00:36:59,631
Rym: When I was doing roofing, there's so many nails to put in that the nail gun was the only way to do them with very good spacing and very good, like the nails are all perfect.

650
00:37:01,618 --> 00:37:03,685
Rym: Like I actually found the nail gun was not a haphazard way.

651
00:37:03,725 --> 00:37:06,938
Rym: Nail gun was for precision and repeatability.

652
00:37:07,118 --> 00:37:08,062
Rym: You were just being lazy.

653
00:37:08,082 --> 00:37:08,947
Scott: Right, right.

654
00:37:08,967 --> 00:37:16,040
Rym: The teacher did not precisely, he just sort of went around the edge like Which makes sense if you're making a set for a play that's going to run for what, two weeks?

655
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:16,721
Scott: Right.

656
00:37:16,741 --> 00:37:16,942
Scott: All right.

657
00:37:17,023 --> 00:37:19,614
Scott: And that was the lesson that I learned right then.

658
00:37:19,815 --> 00:37:21,863
Rym: Do the minimum effort for the maximum payoff?

659
00:37:22,626 --> 00:37:24,955
Scott: A lesson that I learned from that teacher, right.

660
00:37:25,055 --> 00:37:28,632
Scott: Great teacher because, I mean, he successfully taught me a lesson that I remember to this day.

661
00:37:28,693 --> 00:37:30,000
Scott: Therefore, great teacher, right.

662
00:37:31,261 --> 00:37:34,652
Scott: You can't see it from your house, right.

663
00:37:34,772 --> 00:37:38,285
Scott: He's like, yeah, you could bang a nail into this all janky, right.

664
00:37:38,626 --> 00:37:40,956
Scott: Even someone sitting in the front row will never see it.

665
00:37:41,277 --> 00:37:44,888
Rym: That is the same advice that we always give to people at RIT.

666
00:37:45,049 --> 00:37:53,764
Scott: No matter how we nail this in, right, as long as this, it's important that it's put together well so that the students in the play don't fall down or hurt themselves, right.

667
00:37:54,146 --> 00:38:07,276
Scott: But other than that, it's like as long as it looks good enough, you know, even if we spend the time here, an extra hour to make this absolutely perfect, right, the people in the front row will not notice any difference from the job that we have done in five minutes.

668
00:38:07,597 --> 00:38:12,114
Rym: Yup, that's the same philosophy that led us to the radical realization at RIT.

669
00:38:12,515 --> 00:38:14,703
Rym: The low B is the most efficient possible grade.

670
00:38:14,743 --> 00:38:15,927
Rym: There's no pluses or minuses.

671
00:38:16,148 --> 00:38:17,915
Rym: Getting 80% is the same as getting 89%.

672
00:38:17,915 --> 00:38:21,709
Rym: So you would actively, aggressively seek that low B.

673
00:38:22,332 --> 00:38:24,741
Scott: In terms of appearance, right, not in terms of other things.

674
00:38:25,724 --> 00:38:32,286
Scott: And so I think that is really, you know, not only a great life lesson, but also the essence of the power tool, right.

675
00:38:32,366 --> 00:38:42,844
Scott: It's like, yeah, if you saw something carefully by hand, right, or like you sand something carefully by hand, right, as opposed to using a power sander or like a belt sander or something.

676
00:38:42,885 --> 00:38:49,655
Rym: But I'm going to sand something much better with a power sander and a buffer than I would by hand, like much more delicately, much more controlled.

677
00:38:50,238 --> 00:38:51,242
Scott: Well, not if it's small.

678
00:38:52,145 --> 00:38:55,096
Rym: Well, if it's really small, what am I, what am I doing?

679
00:38:55,116 --> 00:38:55,939
Rym: That's finishing work.

680
00:38:55,979 --> 00:38:57,125
Rym: That's a very different ballgame.

681
00:38:57,466 --> 00:38:59,738
Scott: I'm just saying like you're doing, you know, something carefully.

682
00:38:59,799 --> 00:39:02,909
Scott: You can, you know, like I would never tap threads.

683
00:39:03,231 --> 00:39:09,037
Rym: Like if I was putting threads into a piece of metal to be able to put a screw in it later, I would never use a power tool for that.

684
00:39:09,057 --> 00:39:10,664
Rym: I would definitely use like a manual tap.

685
00:39:10,684 --> 00:39:17,411
Scott: Right, but I'm saying it's like when you're doing something by hand, you're looking at it very closely, noticing very, very small details, right.

686
00:39:17,853 --> 00:39:21,126
Scott: And it, but the thing is no one else will notice those small details.

687
00:39:21,147 --> 00:39:22,213
Scott: You're wasting your time, right.

688
00:39:22,253 --> 00:39:23,782
Scott: It's going to look incredible if you don't.

689
00:39:23,802 --> 00:39:24,968
Rym: Yeah, but it depends on what you're doing.

690
00:39:25,008 --> 00:39:31,493
Rym: Like the saw is not a good analogy because if you're sawing wood, your hand sawing will always be a messier job.

691
00:39:31,754 --> 00:39:37,152
Rym: that'll be less precise and less good than using like an actual table saw or a bandsaw or something.

692
00:39:37,172 --> 00:39:39,861
Rym: Like you're not going to do as good a job.

693
00:39:39,882 --> 00:39:42,952
Scott: You know, it could be some filing action.

694
00:39:43,313 --> 00:39:44,376
Rym: Filing is not sawing.

695
00:39:44,456 --> 00:39:45,179
Rym: I said sawing.

696
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:46,202
Rym: You want to talk about filing?

697
00:39:46,243 --> 00:39:47,367
Rym: That's a totally different ballgame.

698
00:39:47,387 --> 00:39:48,350
Rym: It's like I'm metalworking.

699
00:39:50,017 --> 00:39:52,304
Rym: I spent a lot of time working on stuff as a kid.

700
00:39:52,344 --> 00:39:53,107
Scott: You can file wood.

701
00:39:53,127 --> 00:39:56,036
Rym: Yeah, I guess.

702
00:39:56,216 --> 00:39:57,380
Rym: Like you can shave wood too.

703
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:58,601
Rym: Anyway.

704
00:39:58,621 --> 00:39:59,183
Rym: Got a plane?

705
00:39:59,203 --> 00:40:00,127
Rym: You gonna plane some wood?

706
00:40:00,207 --> 00:40:01,151
Rym: You ever plane wood?

707
00:40:02,797 --> 00:40:04,222
Scott: No, but I've seen people plane wood.

708
00:40:04,262 --> 00:40:04,905
Scott: Planing sucks.

709
00:40:05,025 --> 00:40:05,226
Scott: Yeah.

710
00:40:05,567 --> 00:40:07,534
Scott: You need, you need arm strength to plane stuff.

711
00:40:08,598 --> 00:40:15,968
Rym: If I had to, like, because I have a lot of anecdotes, but most of them are either like some kid, like a kid cut his finger kind of halfway off in middle school

712
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:17,373
Scott: because, but

713
00:40:17,494 --> 00:40:22,331
Rym: he was trying to sand a piece of wood by holding it up to the side of a bandsaw because he was a moron.

714
00:40:22,973 --> 00:40:23,836
Scott: What the fuck?

715
00:40:24,258 --> 00:40:25,422
Rym: That's a thing people do.

716
00:40:25,603 --> 00:40:27,430
Rym: I saw people do it more than once.

717
00:40:27,571 --> 00:40:27,952
Rym: I don't know.

718
00:40:27,972 --> 00:40:32,590
Scott: Our, our shop classes stress safety so much and nobody heard them.

719
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:32,891
Scott: Oh yeah.

720
00:40:32,911 --> 00:40:33,694
Rym: The teacher wasn't around.

721
00:40:33,734 --> 00:40:37,609
Rym: Kids immediately started trying to like launch drill bits out of the drill press.

722
00:40:38,252 --> 00:40:40,762
Scott: Everyone followed the safety protocols very carefully.

723
00:40:40,902 --> 00:40:42,749
Rym: I'm just giving through the Wikipedia article.

724
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:44,476
Rym: There's a list of power tools.

725
00:40:45,139 --> 00:40:47,707
Rym: One of them that's listed is just the crusher.

726
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:49,573
Scott: What is the crusher?

727
00:40:49,673 --> 00:40:56,816
Rym: It's a, it's a crusher machine designed to turn large rocks into smaller rocks or to turn smaller rocks into sand or rock dust.

728
00:40:57,678 --> 00:40:57,939
Scott: Okay.

729
00:40:57,959 --> 00:40:59,063
Scott: Let's not mess around with that.

730
00:40:59,405 --> 00:40:59,505
Rym: Yeah.

731
00:40:59,525 --> 00:41:01,091
Rym: I've never used a crusher in my life.

732
00:41:02,195 --> 00:41:07,934
Scott: I think it's also just like growing up, we didn't have a lot of power tools, right?

733
00:41:07,954 --> 00:41:09,198
Rym: The totally different childhood.

734
00:41:09,319 --> 00:41:16,243
Rym: I grew up with like, other than like, it's like, like our garage was full of power tools and like, I used them for projects.

735
00:41:16,464 --> 00:41:20,940
Rym: My grandpa had a full woodworking shop, like a complete industrial woodworking shop.

736
00:41:21,743 --> 00:41:23,068
Scott: My grandpa had a shop, right?

737
00:41:23,128 --> 00:41:25,357
Scott: And he had like a table saw and some other stuff.

738
00:41:25,377 --> 00:41:29,310
Rym: My grandpa's shop was two stories and had an entire production line.

739
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:29,852
Rym: Yeah.

740
00:41:29,892 --> 00:41:30,494
Scott: Not that big.

741
00:41:31,517 --> 00:41:33,403
Scott: It was just like, you know, workshop in the basement.

742
00:41:33,463 --> 00:41:39,423
Rym: He had his, like, he had a bandsaw, he had a jigsaw, and then he had his high precision jigsaw.

743
00:41:40,767 --> 00:41:41,008
Scott: Yeah.

744
00:41:41,108 --> 00:41:46,704
Scott: And we had like drill, you know, uh, I had, we had a sander that shakes like, right?

745
00:41:46,724 --> 00:41:47,305
Scott: Power sander.

746
00:41:47,406 --> 00:41:52,620
Scott: Uh, you know, but it's like, we just, you know, mostly used not power tool.

747
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:53,020
Rym: Yep.

748
00:41:53,101 --> 00:41:57,157
Rym: I guess the tool, the power tools I use the most are like, Dremel's a power tool.

749
00:41:57,277 --> 00:42:12,994
Rym: I use Dremel's and drills the most, but I think that's just because as I became an adult and did not own a house anymore, the kinds of projects where I would do use any other power tools, like back when I made that DDR pad, I used a whole bunch of power tools to make that DDR pad.

750
00:42:13,776 --> 00:42:16,405
Rym: Uh, I don't do things like that anymore because I live in New York City.

751
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:20,960
Rym: So all the stuff I've done recently is all drills.

752
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,083
Rym: It's all just drill stuff.

753
00:42:22,745 --> 00:42:32,276
Rym: If I lived outside of the city, I think I would invest in like a relatively cheap drill CNC and probably use that for a lot of my projects.

754
00:42:32,798 --> 00:42:32,899
Scott: Yeah.

755
00:42:32,919 --> 00:42:42,891
Scott: I think if I did have more like a space and was working on stuff, what I would be doing is, uh, as I was working on projects, right, I would buy tools as needed.

756
00:42:42,911 --> 00:42:43,232
Scott: Yeah.

757
00:42:43,533 --> 00:42:43,774
Scott: Right.

758
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:50,822
Rym: Well, I would assess what the thing I did, the thing I did, I didn't do as a kid because we just had all the tools that I would do now.

759
00:42:51,243 --> 00:42:52,067
Rym: Cause I didn't do this.

760
00:42:52,087 --> 00:42:56,102
Rym: when I made that DDR pad, which meant every couple of days I'd go, Oh fuck.

761
00:42:56,142 --> 00:42:58,815
Rym: And then I'd go to the hardware store and buy like a tool I didn't have.

762
00:42:59,217 --> 00:43:01,710
Rym: And then a few days later, Oh fuck, I'm missing yet another thing.

763
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:02,896
Rym: Cause I didn't plan this project.

764
00:43:03,197 --> 00:43:10,861
Rym: I would plan the project, figure out what parts would need like a real modern power tool to make it efficient or good.

765
00:43:11,142 --> 00:43:13,592
Rym: And then buy all the tools I needed before I started the project.

766
00:43:14,836 --> 00:43:15,800
Rym: And I would never buy a tool.

767
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:17,607
Rym: I didn't have a project already lined up for.

768
00:43:18,632 --> 00:43:24,936
Scott: Something else I noticed is that, you know, like the first power tools that I used were all plugged into the wall.

769
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:26,402
Scott: Like the drill that I still have.

770
00:43:26,422 --> 00:43:28,089
Rym: Batteries barely existed back then.

771
00:43:28,109 --> 00:43:31,644
Scott: So if your only option is a, it was a plug into the wall drill, right?

772
00:43:31,705 --> 00:43:33,171
Rym: I had a lot of pneumatic tools too.

773
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:33,853
Rym: Yeah.

774
00:43:33,934 --> 00:43:35,239
Rym: We had an air compressor.

775
00:43:35,259 --> 00:43:37,550
Rym: I'd fire that thing up and plug the pneumatic tools in.

776
00:43:38,173 --> 00:43:38,314
Scott: Yeah.

777
00:43:38,334 --> 00:43:39,037
Scott: That's the good stuff.

778
00:43:39,077 --> 00:43:39,278
Scott: Yeah.

779
00:43:39,298 --> 00:43:40,464
Rym: We had the pneumatic drill.

780
00:43:40,684 --> 00:43:42,713
Rym: That thing made so much goddamn noise.

781
00:43:42,733 --> 00:43:43,356
Scott: All right.

782
00:43:43,376 --> 00:43:46,067
Scott: But battery powered stuff did come right.

783
00:43:46,127 --> 00:43:47,271
Scott: But a lot of it was weak.

784
00:43:47,312 --> 00:43:50,544
Scott: Like the battery powered screwdriver I have is actually extremely old.

785
00:43:50,564 --> 00:43:55,543
Scott: Uh, relatively speaking, it must be from like maybe the nineties or early two thousands.

786
00:43:55,583 --> 00:43:58,437
Scott: I don't even know, but it's actually not that powerful.

787
00:43:58,518 --> 00:44:01,967
Scott: It kind of goes, it doesn't go like, right.

788
00:44:02,368 --> 00:44:04,797
Scott: It's our, it spins very slowly and weakly.

789
00:44:04,817 --> 00:44:12,491
Rym: Uh, I mean, like we had an electric lawnmower and even that had a cord going all the way back to the house because batteries, lithium batteries did not exist back then.

790
00:44:12,972 --> 00:44:14,196
Scott: Like gas lawnmower.

791
00:44:14,497 --> 00:44:15,280
Scott: We had plug it in.

792
00:44:15,601 --> 00:44:26,760
Scott: That's what I'm saying is that the lithium ion battery is, you know, we think of it always in terms of phones and our electronic devices was actually a huge, huge development for power tools.

793
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:32,381
Scott: Cause now a, you don't have to plug them in then and they can be powerful and they won't be as heavy.

794
00:44:32,522 --> 00:44:32,763
Scott: Yeah.

795
00:44:32,863 --> 00:44:33,726
Rym: Right.

796
00:44:34,248 --> 00:44:36,536
Scott: And they won't run out of energy in like five minutes.

797
00:44:36,556 --> 00:44:36,817
Scott: Yep.

798
00:44:37,078 --> 00:44:46,940
Rym: And what, especially once they standardize, like depending if you buy from like the same company or like the same set of companies, you can buy generic batteries that will work in all your power tools.

799
00:44:47,281 --> 00:44:49,007
Rym: That, that changed everything.

800
00:44:49,027 --> 00:44:52,620
Scott: Cause my first, even, even my vacuum is like a battery vacuum.

801
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:53,846
Scott: Now I don't have to plug it.

802
00:44:53,906 --> 00:44:57,086
Scott: I've never, it was the first vacuum I've had in my life that didn't have to be plugged into the wall.

803
00:44:57,107 --> 00:44:58,716
Scott: That wasn't just like a little dust buster.

804
00:44:58,817 --> 00:45:05,042
Rym: The tool I had the most fun with though, like, cause whatever is in my middle school had like a really advanced shop.

805
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:10,145
Rym: Like we had a plastics lab, like we had all these different plastic forming tools and all sorts of fun.

806
00:45:10,186 --> 00:45:11,552
Scott: You lived in white people town.

807
00:45:11,613 --> 00:45:15,028
Rym: No, this was when, this was when we lived in the poor town before we moved to the white people town.

808
00:45:15,711 --> 00:45:15,852
Scott: No.

809
00:45:15,892 --> 00:45:16,133
Scott: Okay.

810
00:45:16,735 --> 00:45:18,562
Rym: I never took shop once we moved to Sterling Heights.

811
00:45:18,663 --> 00:45:21,091
Rym: I didn't take shop in middle school.

812
00:45:21,874 --> 00:45:23,500
Scott: I didn't take shop in high school either.

813
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:25,145
Scott: They, I took, like I said, AutoCAD.

814
00:45:25,246 --> 00:45:25,506
Scott: Great.

815
00:45:25,607 --> 00:45:27,474
Scott: But they did have it.

816
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:29,140
Scott: They had all kinds of fancy stuff.

817
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,649
Scott: They had actually an entire garage.

818
00:45:30,689 --> 00:45:33,242
Scott: You could learn like, you know, to be an auto mechanic on my high school.

819
00:45:33,262 --> 00:45:33,904
Rym: We had that too.

820
00:45:33,964 --> 00:45:35,950
Rym: And I kind of wanted to do it, but that class always filled up.

821
00:45:37,391 --> 00:45:42,929
Rym: But, uh, we, uh, had in the middle school, a CNC drill press and a CNC lathe.

822
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:58,738
Rym: And that was like the moment when the idea of automation, like really clicked with me as a kid, because I watched this thing and I was like, wait, I can basically write code like the turtle program and then a robot will do what.

823
00:45:58,778 --> 00:46:03,073
Rym: I told the, and my brain, my kid brain in sixth grade was just like, Oh fuck.

824
00:46:03,494 --> 00:46:04,176
Rym: Oh wow.

825
00:46:04,638 --> 00:46:06,002
Rym: Oh, I want one of these.

826
00:46:06,022 --> 00:46:06,845
Scott: Yeah.

827
00:46:07,005 --> 00:46:08,329
Scott: I mean, we had that in high school, right?

828
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:09,716
Scott: When we were doing AutoCAD, right?

829
00:46:09,736 --> 00:46:13,474
Scott: You could have, there was one of the AutoCAD classes was like mechanical CAD.

830
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:17,069
Scott: And if you took that, you would make things and you would design like parts.

831
00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:21,103
Scott: And then they had a CNC to make the parts that you drew in AutoCAD.

832
00:46:21,123 --> 00:46:24,135
Scott: Uh, and that was with late nineties technology.

833
00:46:24,216 --> 00:46:24,537
Scott: Right?

834
00:46:24,557 --> 00:46:27,390
Scott: So what they have today is like incredible compared to that.

835
00:46:29,111 --> 00:46:30,095
Rym: Yeah.

836
00:46:30,195 --> 00:46:31,761
Rym: I was typing to the listener.

837
00:46:31,781 --> 00:46:34,029
Rym: There's a, there's a lively chat going on right now.

838
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:35,472
Scott: Oh, that's good.

839
00:46:36,956 --> 00:46:37,759
Scott: Have fun, have fun.

840
00:46:37,799 --> 00:46:38,501
Scott: Lively chatter.

841
00:46:38,521 --> 00:46:38,702
Scott: Yep.

842
00:46:39,444 --> 00:46:42,575
Scott: But, uh, YouTube and lively chat with them or not.

843
00:46:43,177 --> 00:46:45,005
Scott: You have something better to do, but yeah.

844
00:46:45,045 --> 00:46:57,286
Rym: Nowadays, like just living in an apartment, the drill and the like handheld saw, like the jigsaw style handheld saw are the only tools that I use with any regularity, but I use them kind of often.

845
00:46:57,407 --> 00:47:02,006
Rym: And I try to use that drill for everything because it's a really great drill for what I paid for it.

846
00:47:02,046 --> 00:47:04,155
Rym: And it has torque settings and all the stuff I might need.

847
00:47:04,175 --> 00:47:05,199
Rym: Yeah.

848
00:47:05,219 --> 00:47:11,493
Scott: It's like, I was actually had to do a project recently and, you know, some of my friends were suggesting, Oh, you can just, you know, they were like, get these tiles.

849
00:47:11,654 --> 00:47:15,090
Scott: And instead I was, I was trying to put some stuff onto my, uh, my little balcony.

850
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:15,751
Rym: Yeah.

851
00:47:15,771 --> 00:47:17,198
Rym: I remember you were talking about that.

852
00:47:17,319 --> 00:47:22,200
Scott: I ended up just getting the cheapo piece of fake grass, AstroTurf in a roll, right?

853
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:22,681
Scott: It's working.

854
00:47:23,223 --> 00:47:23,665
Scott: Uh, that's good.

855
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:26,156
Scott: But they were like, yeah, you can get these patio tiles.

856
00:47:26,237 --> 00:47:27,886
Scott: And I'm like, Whoa, those actually look way better.

857
00:47:27,966 --> 00:47:30,798
Scott: And then I think they might've been way better than the fake piece of grass.

858
00:47:31,239 --> 00:47:36,201
Scott: Uh, the problem is to cut a tile is not something you can really do without a power tool.

859
00:47:36,261 --> 00:47:41,603
Rym: And it's like, and depending on the tile, you might want like a water cooled like table saw, right?

860
00:47:41,643 --> 00:47:47,383
Scott: It's like, I'm not buying like a circular power saw just to cut a few tiles and then never need it again.

861
00:47:48,306 --> 00:47:50,999
Scott: Also, that's a really dangerous tool that I don't have a lot of experience.

862
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:53,011
Rym: That's actually the last thing I wanted to get into.

863
00:47:53,091 --> 00:48:01,301
Rym: Cause one thing I've realized is that like, even talking to you now, I've realized that I have weirdly like, I know a lot about power tools.

864
00:48:01,321 --> 00:48:06,037
Rym: I'm very comfortable using them, but I know that most people our age are not in America.

865
00:48:06,398 --> 00:48:17,397
Scott: Like, I mean, even in the shop classes that I took, well, I think you, you know, you're also mostly hanging out with people who don't work in, you know, industries and fields.

866
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:17,918
Scott: Yeah, true.

867
00:48:17,959 --> 00:48:21,432
Rym: Like my, my, my circles are very much like people on Twitter.

868
00:48:21,633 --> 00:48:28,942
Rym: Your friends are not like construction workers and plumbers and things, but I grew up where my dad part, like I did a lot of roofing as a kid.

869
00:48:28,962 --> 00:48:31,852
Rym: cause my dad did a lot of roofing to help support the family.

870
00:48:31,893 --> 00:48:35,425
Rym: Like families working three jobs across two parents to keep us going.

871
00:48:36,167 --> 00:48:42,855
Rym: And as a result, like my, like everyone in my family was like very well versed in power tools, like the entire extended family.

872
00:48:43,357 --> 00:48:49,322
Rym: Everybody knew how to use power tools and it was assumed that everyone taught their kids how to use power tools at a very young age.

873
00:48:49,382 --> 00:48:51,150
Rym: I was learning like table saw safety.

874
00:48:51,611 --> 00:48:57,907
Rym: Like I'm talking when I was like eight and I know that is not everyone's experience.

875
00:48:58,649 --> 00:48:58,790
Scott: Right.

876
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:04,531
Scott: But I mean, you know, even the tools I did learn to use, like in shop class, we used like table saws and right.

877
00:49:04,592 --> 00:49:06,341
Scott: It's like you go to the hardware stores.

878
00:49:06,361 --> 00:49:13,506
Scott: Like there's a bunch of other tools there that were not taught in class and were not used for any like home kind of projects.

879
00:49:13,948 --> 00:49:14,248
Scott: Right.

880
00:49:14,449 --> 00:49:18,463
Scott: But I guess it's like I would watch people on TV, use them like Norm Abrams or whatever.

881
00:49:19,045 --> 00:49:21,274
Rym: I watch all those shows as a kid too.

882
00:49:21,315 --> 00:49:33,084
Scott: Although it's like I chose, like I always saw him using like his router to like, you know, make edges around the, you know, piece of wood when he was making furniture and, you know, he'd like, uh, you know, do all kinds of fancy stuff.

883
00:49:33,124 --> 00:49:34,470
Scott: I've heard it's been so long, right?

884
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:35,173
Scott: Right.

885
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:40,777
Scott: Um, but it's like, you know, I saw all those tools, but I didn't know anyone who owned any of those tools because who did?

886
00:49:40,797 --> 00:49:44,494
Scott: I know there was a furniture maker and no one was going to teach me how to use them.

887
00:49:44,554 --> 00:49:48,969
Scott: I can learn from YouTube now, but I'm already like 30 something years old.

888
00:49:50,110 --> 00:49:50,512
Scott: Right.

889
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:56,313
Scott: It's like, you know, and I just go to the store and even got out of jail until he was like 45.

890
00:49:56,313 --> 00:49:57,035
Rym: Right.

891
00:49:57,076 --> 00:49:59,204
Scott: It's like going to go buy something I don't know how to use.

892
00:49:59,566 --> 00:49:59,827
Scott: Right.

893
00:49:59,947 --> 00:50:00,670
Scott: Is dangerous.

894
00:50:00,951 --> 00:50:01,192
Rym: Yup.

895
00:50:01,514 --> 00:50:02,439
Rym: Well, that's the thing that

896
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:03,303
Scott: the YouTube

897
00:50:03,323 --> 00:50:17,567
Rym: era maybe will fix things a little bit, but one thing that always struck me when I encountered people, like when I was a kid, especially, and I encountered people like in that shop class, the powered, like there's a certain class of power tool, like a dremel or like just a drill, like a drill.

898
00:50:17,587 --> 00:50:22,714
Rym: You just go to Home Depot and buy if you don't know better, not like a pneumatic drill or anything where it's pretty obvious how to use them.

899
00:50:23,215 --> 00:50:32,970
Rym: And the dangers in them are also pretty obvious, but most power tools, I think the difficulty with them for most people is that the dangers are not obvious.

900
00:50:33,350 --> 00:50:38,010
Rym: Like there's obvious, like you look at a table saw and you can imagine the dangers looking at it.

901
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:45,719
Rym: Like you can imagine all the ways you can touch the sharp spinning part, but people don't imagine like they don't know how to use it safely.

902
00:50:45,759 --> 00:50:49,172
Rym: And there's a lot of non obvious dangers to these tools.

903
00:50:49,553 --> 00:51:00,511
Rym: Like if you leave the Chuck in a drill press, like the thing that you use to tighten the drill bit on and you spin that drill press, that Chuck will fly like a bullet and could kill someone.

904
00:51:01,073 --> 00:51:01,715
Scott: Yeah.

905
00:51:01,755 --> 00:51:07,192
Scott: I think the most the most dangerous thing that the thing I'm scared of the most is the lathes, right?

906
00:51:07,252 --> 00:51:09,179
Scott: It's like a laser.

907
00:51:10,142 --> 00:51:15,143
Rym: It's only scary because you're right next to it and you can't wear gloves because you really got to have that fine control.

908
00:51:15,163 --> 00:51:17,032
Rym: You've got to be confident in your abilities.

909
00:51:17,052 --> 00:51:23,078
Scott: There is this thing that is spinning really fast and it's like, oh, it's just like maybe you're making a table leg, right?

910
00:51:23,138 --> 00:51:24,545
Scott: It's like or maybe it's a metal.

911
00:51:24,566 --> 00:51:25,631
Scott: It could be a metal lathe too.

912
00:51:25,671 --> 00:51:33,340
Rym: But I mean, I prefer CNC lathes because while I was very comfortable working with lathes, that was a younger Rym who was more reckless.

913
00:51:33,681 --> 00:51:38,120
Rym: I don't know if Rym today wants to just like be working up close with a high like a high speed, powerful.

914
00:51:38,502 --> 00:51:46,572
Scott: It's like, OK, so there's like a thing spinning really fast and it's like you poke it with tools to, you know, grind away and around evenly.

915
00:51:46,632 --> 00:51:46,813
Scott: Right.

916
00:51:48,499 --> 00:51:52,475
Scott: But hey, it's like, well, what if you're wearing like, you know, you know, wouldn't even think about it.

917
00:51:52,516 --> 00:51:54,347
Scott: It's like your hoodie has some strings coming out.

918
00:51:54,467 --> 00:51:55,392
Rym: Oh, I think about that.

919
00:51:56,556 --> 00:51:58,302
Rym: That was a big part of my childhood.

920
00:51:58,342 --> 00:51:59,486
Rym: tutelage and power tools.

921
00:51:59,927 --> 00:52:00,128
Scott: Right.

922
00:52:00,188 --> 00:52:08,486
Scott: It's like one of the strings from your hoodie goes down into the lathe a little bit while you're leaning over it, gets wrapped around and basically was going to pull your head and smash it.

923
00:52:08,506 --> 00:52:09,109
Scott: Yeah.

924
00:52:09,149 --> 00:52:09,310
Scott: Right.

925
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:12,539
Rym: Don't lean over the lathe.

926
00:52:12,579 --> 00:52:16,554
Rym: Make sure the lathe is high enough where you can work from the side, like it's right.

927
00:52:16,634 --> 00:52:25,282
Rym: There's this whole concept because it's an industrial stuff, too, of any power tool has like safe lanes and dangerous lanes.

928
00:52:25,382 --> 00:52:32,083
Rym: Like imagine like planes or rays radiating out from the tool where there is more danger than other places.

929
00:52:32,123 --> 00:52:35,114
Rym: You could shake hands with danger, shake hands with danger.

930
00:52:35,134 --> 00:52:36,340
Rym: Right.

931
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:40,960
Scott: But yeah, it's like, you know, I think that's the fundamental thing is you have a power to the chat.

932
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:44,333
Rym: It's just like, you know, my expertise and even I maintain a healthy fear.

933
00:52:44,454 --> 00:52:45,819
Rym: slash respect for lathes.

934
00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:46,642
Scott: That's right.

935
00:52:46,682 --> 00:52:47,947
Scott: The lathe is super dangerous.

936
00:52:47,987 --> 00:52:48,289
Scott: Yeah.

937
00:52:48,509 --> 00:52:52,360
Rym: Well, rotational injuries are the scariest injuries.

938
00:52:52,982 --> 00:52:53,183
Scott: Yep.

939
00:52:53,624 --> 00:52:55,670
Rym: Crushing is like a number three on that list.

940
00:52:56,491 --> 00:52:56,632
Scott: Yep.

941
00:52:57,978 --> 00:53:00,007
Rym: Don't Google some of the other ways you can get hurt with power tools.

942
00:53:00,027 --> 00:53:01,613
Scott: When you gain efficiency.

943
00:53:01,734 --> 00:53:01,895
Scott: Right.

944
00:53:01,915 --> 00:53:03,481
Scott: Since I'm used to working with computers.

945
00:53:03,602 --> 00:53:03,762
Scott: Right.

946
00:53:03,863 --> 00:53:05,650
Scott: Efficiency gains with computers.

947
00:53:06,011 --> 00:53:06,252
Scott: Right.

948
00:53:06,332 --> 00:53:07,677
Scott: If you use more powerful tools.

949
00:53:07,798 --> 00:53:22,813
Scott: and this is like, you know, a famous writing by Neil Stevenson, the whole hog, where he compares the Unix operating system to this drill made by the Milwaukee Tool Company, the whole hog, which is just a ridiculously powerful drill that is not for normal people.

950
00:53:22,914 --> 00:53:23,135
Scott: I don't.

951
00:53:23,275 --> 00:53:28,538
Scott: I've heard they maybe don't make it anymore or the current model isn't as strong as the old model or something like that.

952
00:53:28,999 --> 00:53:40,970
Scott: Regardless, where it's like, yeah, look, the operating system is more powerful, but also you can mess up because it's more powerful and there's less, you know, mechanisms, safety mechanisms and restraints on it.

953
00:53:41,412 --> 00:53:44,147
Scott: You could end up deleting all your files by accident and you're just screwed.

954
00:53:44,348 --> 00:53:53,143
Rym: Like if you set the torque settings wrong on a fancy drill and you try to like screw a drywall screw in, you might just go and put a huge hole in your wall and destroy everything.

955
00:53:54,026 --> 00:54:01,046
Scott: But the difference with the power tools is the danger is irreparable harm to human bodies.

956
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:01,727
Scott: Right.

957
00:54:02,088 --> 00:54:05,158
Rym: Or you're probably like, oops, I knocked down this wall in my house.

958
00:54:05,821 --> 00:54:06,021
Scott: Right.

959
00:54:06,081 --> 00:54:13,667
Scott: Unless you're working on medical devices or something like that or, you know, aerospace software or something of that nature.

960
00:54:13,687 --> 00:54:14,390
Scott: Right.

961
00:54:15,470 --> 00:54:19,844
Scott: Messing up is just going to hurt data or maybe cost someone money.

962
00:54:20,165 --> 00:54:21,108
Scott: It's not going to do well.

963
00:54:21,830 --> 00:54:26,326
Rym: You know, there is a confluence between the two where there is still harm.

964
00:54:26,687 --> 00:54:27,490
Rym: Medical equipment.

965
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:29,716
Scott: I said that 25.

966
00:54:29,716 --> 00:54:31,702
Scott: Yeah, I said that already.

967
00:54:31,823 --> 00:54:34,612
Rym: I think there's more instances of that than people realize though.

968
00:54:34,632 --> 00:54:36,357
Scott: There's probably a lot.

969
00:54:36,397 --> 00:54:36,658
Scott: Yes.

970
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:41,233
Rym: I mean, cars, like every car has a lot of computers in it doing stuff.

971
00:54:41,354 --> 00:54:43,144
Scott: That's the thing is like a car is a power tool.

972
00:54:43,185 --> 00:54:43,386
Scott: Right.

973
00:54:43,527 --> 00:54:43,788
Scott: Yeah.

974
00:54:43,889 --> 00:54:45,673
Scott: You know, yeah.

975
00:54:45,734 --> 00:54:50,819
Rym: I mean, lawnmower is even listed in Wikipedia as a power tool because I've used a non-powered lawnmower before.

976
00:54:51,101 --> 00:54:51,382
Rym: It sucks.

977
00:54:51,422 --> 00:54:52,165
Rym: I used it once.

978
00:54:52,306 --> 00:54:53,029
Scott: It sucks ass.

979
00:54:53,833 --> 00:54:54,616
Rym: I'll qualify.

980
00:54:54,737 --> 00:54:55,259
Rym: It's great.

981
00:54:55,279 --> 00:54:56,846
Scott: And I was mowing a very, very tiny.

982
00:54:56,866 --> 00:55:00,121
Rym: It's really, really great as long as you maintain it and keep the blade sharp.

983
00:55:00,603 --> 00:55:02,471
Rym: Sharpening the blade is not worth the effort.

984
00:55:03,092 --> 00:55:08,668
Scott: I used one to mow a very, very tiny New York City lawn, like the tiniest.

985
00:55:09,309 --> 00:55:11,195
Scott: And it still sucked.

986
00:55:11,215 --> 00:55:12,181
Scott: Oh, my grandparents had one.

987
00:55:12,221 --> 00:55:12,644
Rym: It was great.

988
00:55:12,664 --> 00:55:13,348
Rym: You could mow a jack.

989
00:55:13,388 --> 00:55:14,573
Rym: We had like an acre lawn.

990
00:55:14,593 --> 00:55:15,296
Rym: You could just mow it.

991
00:55:15,336 --> 00:55:15,918
Rym: It was fine.

992
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:19,291
Rym: But you had to sharpen that shit every time you used it.

993
00:55:19,331 --> 00:55:20,596
Rym: That took longer than mowing the lawn.

994
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:22,263
Scott: It was not.

995
00:55:22,725 --> 00:55:23,870
Rym: I think yours just wasn't sharp.

996
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:25,576
Scott: It was very sharp.

997
00:55:25,716 --> 00:55:26,621
Rym: I don't think it was sharp.

998
00:55:26,902 --> 00:55:31,641
Rym: If it was sharp and well made, like manual mowers are really, really easy to use.

999
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:32,183
Scott: Just pushing it.

1000
00:55:32,263 --> 00:55:33,730
Scott: It was just so heavy to push.

1001
00:55:35,454 --> 00:55:37,001
Rym: Oh, that might just be a Scott problem.

1002
00:55:38,347 --> 00:55:38,950
Scott: I was pushing it.

1003
00:55:42,112 --> 00:55:44,442
Rym: Of course, as a kid, I had a mower that I used.

1004
00:55:44,562 --> 00:55:48,338
Rym: sometimes that was sort of powered, it would kind of pull itself along.

1005
00:55:50,047 --> 00:55:50,730
Scott: Oh, we didn't have that.

1006
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:51,533
Rym: Yeah, we had that.

1007
00:55:51,573 --> 00:55:52,416
Rym: That was real nice.

1008
00:55:52,657 --> 00:56:00,050
Rym: Except sometimes it would pull a little too far and I'd have to mess with it to not let it go into the sidewalk or go where I didn't want it to go.

1009
00:56:00,651 --> 00:56:01,876
Rym: It was not super safe either.

1010
00:56:01,896 --> 00:56:07,437
Scott: We just had normal old school style, but gas powered ones where you'd push it.

1011
00:56:07,577 --> 00:56:14,283
Scott: But eventually we just stopped mowing the lawn and paid someone to come and mow it with a giant commercial mower.

1012
00:56:15,107 --> 00:56:15,910
Scott: It's like, oh, that's easier.

1013
00:56:16,351 --> 00:56:16,993
Scott: Yeah.

1014
00:56:17,174 --> 00:56:18,458
Scott: And then I never had a lawn again.

1015
00:56:19,441 --> 00:56:30,096
Rym: But I think in terms of like a lot of people in the US in particular over time, I think there is less exposure to power tools for a lot of reasons for people.

1016
00:56:30,116 --> 00:56:32,648
Rym: And I don't know if that's necessarily a bad thing.

1017
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:39,290
Rym: No, I mean, it's like, you don't need to use power tools unless you have a use case for power tools.

1018
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:39,791
Scott: Right.

1019
00:56:39,811 --> 00:56:45,337
Scott: It's a good thing they exist for and they keep developing and improving upon them for increased safety and efficiency.

1020
00:56:45,397 --> 00:56:45,538
Scott: Right.

1021
00:56:45,558 --> 00:56:49,115
Scott: It's like, imagine if everything was still made with handheld tools.

1022
00:56:49,136 --> 00:56:49,940
Scott: We wouldn't have anything.

1023
00:56:50,041 --> 00:56:52,292
Rym: Or imagine like early power tools, you know how they were powered?

1024
00:56:52,573 --> 00:57:04,454
Rym: There were giant rotating wheels and pulleys in the ceiling and you would basically put a rope or a belt over one of those things down and then wrap it around the tool you're going to use.

1025
00:57:04,716 --> 00:57:07,731
Rym: And it's just spinning next to you and spinning in the ceiling while you're working.

1026
00:57:08,534 --> 00:57:08,695
Scott: Yes.

1027
00:57:08,715 --> 00:57:09,277
Scott: Stuff like that.

1028
00:57:09,458 --> 00:57:11,747
Rym: And pneumatic power tools, like they're way good.

1029
00:57:12,068 --> 00:57:15,710
Rym: But also, if you fuck up with a compressor, it'll kill you and everyone in the room.

1030
00:57:17,391 --> 00:57:18,354
Scott: Or hydraulic as well.

1031
00:57:19,497 --> 00:57:20,259
Scott: Very dangerous.

1032
00:57:22,085 --> 00:57:23,850
Rym: Or like a lot of early power tools weren't grounded.

1033
00:57:24,751 --> 00:57:26,559
Rym: Just get electrocuted by the drill.

1034
00:57:27,765 --> 00:57:28,950
Scott: Oh, I guess that could happen too.

1035
00:57:28,950 --> 00:57:31,490
Rym: Double insulation was not a thing in a lot of early power tools.

1036
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:38,278
Scott: You know, I mean, really all power tools, when you think about it, are the modern ones, right?

1037
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:42,010
Scott: Are just motors attached to a thing, right?

1038
00:57:43,072 --> 00:57:48,732
Scott: It's just, okay, so we have electricity, we're converting the electrical force into mechanical force.

1039
00:57:48,913 --> 00:57:50,477
Scott: Either rotational or linear.

1040
00:57:51,079 --> 00:57:55,894
Scott: And then we're putting a normal old tool on the end of the motor, right?

1041
00:57:56,196 --> 00:57:58,808
Scott: It's like, okay, we converted electricity into spinning and now...

1042
00:57:59,049 --> 00:58:00,052
Rym: Oh no, that's going even better.

1043
00:58:00,253 --> 00:58:03,645
Rym: We're taking that power and giving it a user experience.

1044
00:58:04,448 --> 00:58:06,616
Rym: Like a way to guide it to do something.

1045
00:58:06,636 --> 00:58:09,227
Scott: You know, it's like, okay, we have a spinning motor.

1046
00:58:09,248 --> 00:58:10,151
Scott: We'll put a saw on it.

1047
00:58:10,171 --> 00:58:11,115
Scott: We got a spinning motor.

1048
00:58:11,136 --> 00:58:13,144
Scott: We'll put a drill bit on it, right?

1049
00:58:13,646 --> 00:58:14,510
Scott: We'll have a spinning motor.

1050
00:58:14,670 --> 00:58:18,967
Scott: Okay, we'll put some gears to make it into something linear, you know.

1051
00:58:19,068 --> 00:58:28,778
Rym: But I guess in terms of like practical advice to the people listening to this show, what I would say is, there's a certain low tier of power tool that everyone should probably have and be able to use.

1052
00:58:28,818 --> 00:58:35,951
Scott: Like friend.

1053
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:39,985
Rym: Oh my god, a dremel and like one real handheld drill.

1054
00:58:40,747 --> 00:58:45,889
Scott: And the soldering iron, which I guess is a power tool, even though that uses heat and not mechanical energy.

1055
00:58:46,029 --> 00:58:49,829
Rym: Yeah, but I guess there also isn't really a free power equivalent of that.

1056
00:58:51,830 --> 00:58:52,775
Rym: What are you soldering before?

1057
00:58:52,795 --> 00:58:53,660
Rym: you had a soldering iron?

1058
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:54,465
Rym: How are you doing that?

1059
00:58:54,585 --> 00:58:55,330
Scott: You just welded.

1060
00:58:55,730 --> 00:58:56,976
Rym: Yeah, how are you well?

1061
00:58:57,016 --> 00:58:59,750
Rym: Well, yeah, welding is a whole different topic we're not talking about.

1062
00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:00,232
Scott: I don't know.

1063
00:59:00,252 --> 00:59:02,707
Scott: How did they connect wires to vacuum tubes back in the day?

1064
00:59:02,787 --> 00:59:03,210
Scott: I don't know.

1065
00:59:03,712 --> 00:59:04,798
Rym: Solder existed then.

1066
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,245
Scott: Solder must have existed.

1067
00:59:06,265 --> 00:59:07,109
Rym: So did soldering irons.

1068
00:59:08,010 --> 00:59:09,937
Rym: Electricity has been around for a long time.

1069
00:59:10,198 --> 00:59:11,443
Scott: When did it not exist?

1070
00:59:11,684 --> 00:59:17,664
Rym: And using electricity to make metal hot has existed for as long as humans have harnessed electricity.

1071
00:59:18,607 --> 00:59:19,389
Scott: I suppose so.

1072
00:59:21,010 --> 00:59:35,117
Rym: But basically, other than that low tier stuff, don't buy a power tool unless you understand it and understand why you need it and what it will do for you compared to a much safer non-power alternative.

1073
00:59:35,338 --> 00:59:37,129
Rym: If you can answer all those questions, you're good to go.

1074
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:40,726
Scott: I'd also make sure it's something you're going to use frequently.

1075
00:59:40,766 --> 00:59:41,349
Rym: More than once?

1076
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:43,680
Scott: You could, well, you could rent a power tool, of course.

1077
00:59:43,761 --> 00:59:44,324
Scott: That's a good idea.

1078
00:59:44,344 --> 00:59:46,836
Rym: I have many times in my life rented power tools.

1079
00:59:47,077 --> 00:59:48,885
Rym: But like that's just a thing.

1080
00:59:48,905 --> 00:59:58,062
Scott: If you're only going to use it a few times, it's like doing it by hand is still, even if, you know, even if it would have saved you like two hours on two jobs, right?

1081
00:59:58,464 --> 01:00:03,870
Scott: If you're never going to use it again, you're better off just, okay, just spend the two hours, use your handheld, whatever.

1082
01:00:07,241 --> 01:00:09,491
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1083
01:00:09,531 --> 01:00:14,694
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1084
01:00:14,915 --> 01:00:19,954
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1085
01:00:20,195 --> 01:00:22,866
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one but four different shows.

1086
01:00:23,007 --> 01:00:27,627
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1089
01:00:35,658 --> 01:00:38,587
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1090

1091
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:09,629
Rym: Uh, yeah, it's real hot, and it's gonna get hotter.

1092
01:01:10,111 --> 01:01:13,605
Rym: But now, I'm gonna leave you with something that I hope you don't remember.

1093
01:01:13,625 --> 01:01:15,692
Scott: Welcome to Larry King Live.

1094
01:01:16,094 --> 01:01:17,740
Rym: How do you explain Tim Allen?

1095
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,101
Rym: Oh, Phil Collins is.
