00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,661
Rym: It's Wednesday October 14th 2020.

2
00:00:10,661 --> 00:00:14,988
Rym: I'm Rym Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:16,633
Rym: We are talking about an anime.

4
00:00:16,713 --> 00:00:17,375
Rym: I am confident.

5
00:00:17,395 --> 00:00:21,988
Rym: None of you have actually watched extra olympia kick-a-loops.

6
00:00:23,842 --> 00:00:28,308
Scott: Let's do this All right, so check this out.

7
00:00:28,348 --> 00:00:29,392
Scott: This is ridiculous.

8
00:00:29,432 --> 00:00:31,480
Scott: thing happened right and it's not over yet.

9
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,459
Scott: So there might be a follow-up which is good because we need opening bits, right?

10
00:00:35,151 --> 00:00:39,956
Scott: So I Pre-ordered something from CD Japan.

11
00:00:40,076 --> 00:00:48,240
Scott: if you don't know CD Japan is basically a website where you can buy Japanese, you know media physical medias, right around for a while.

12
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:49,727
Scott: It's been around for a long time.

13
00:00:49,908 --> 00:00:52,400
Scott: I think I ordered the first time ever ordered something from there.

14
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,143
Scott: I was in college.

15
00:00:53,183 --> 00:00:56,374
Scott: So they've been around for at least 15 20 years and it's it's.

16
00:00:56,735 --> 00:01:01,149
Scott: it's not a cheap website But it is very reliable and trustworthy and legit.

17
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:06,084
Scott: They will send you real products right for the price you pay And they won't.

18
00:01:06,224 --> 00:01:07,470
Scott: you know, they they're your chart.

19
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:09,620
Scott: you're paying full price, but you're not getting ripped off.

20
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,098
Scott: So there you go free free advertising Japan.

21
00:01:15,184 --> 00:01:20,880
Scott: But there was like these Evangelion anniversary OS teas that I ordered a long time ago.

22
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:30,420
Scott: I pre-ordered the many many moons in advance and my idea was you know It might be a little difficult to get digital versions of these right anywhere even piracy.

23
00:01:30,923 --> 00:01:33,135
Scott: So I'll be the one to rip them and then I'll sell it.

24
00:01:33,175 --> 00:01:44,440
Scott: a book off or something which I've done in the past with Japanese DVDs and CDs, you know You know buy them rip them cash them in right get you most of your money back.

25
00:01:45,327 --> 00:01:54,932
Scott: so What happened was I you know, as long as when you're living in New York Packages sometimes say they're delivered and they're not right sometimes.

26
00:01:54,972 --> 00:01:58,180
Rym: I've never had that happen in a deck sometimes.

27
00:01:58,722 --> 00:02:03,020
Rym: Yeah, I mean sometimes I've had the opposite where something was delivered, but I didn't order anything.

28
00:02:04,042 --> 00:02:07,040
Scott: Okay, sometimes it happens because it got delivered at the wrong address.

29
00:02:07,441 --> 00:02:14,040
Scott: Sometimes the market is delivered to like make Amazon happy that the thing was delivered on time and then actually deliver it the next day.

30
00:02:14,361 --> 00:02:18,780
Scott: Alright, so that Amazon's not like hey, this was delayed right gets mad at the post office.

31
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,906
Scott: Sometimes, you know, it gets stolen.

32
00:02:22,307 --> 00:02:25,720
Scott: That's happens right if you have a doorman that doesn't happen as much.

33
00:02:25,861 --> 00:02:33,419
Scott: Yeah, so this package said it was delivered But my building didn't have it and the next-door building didn't have it and the next next-door building didn't have.

34
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,695
Rym: ah That's the good check cuz that once a package got delivered to the other identical building next door.

35
00:02:38,715 --> 00:02:38,835
Rym: Yep.

36
00:02:39,517 --> 00:02:39,658
Scott: Yep.

37
00:02:39,858 --> 00:02:50,540
Scott: So, uh, I Finally go and this thing always happens to me Regardless of whether it's a missing package or a bug report for software or any crazy any problem in life.

38
00:02:51,022 --> 00:02:53,371
Scott: You know you reach that point where you're trying to solve it yourself.

39
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:58,600
Scott: You can't solve it yourself and you end up Emailing somebody right to get the help.

40
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:06,793
Scott: it's like well, I guess I got a contact customer service now and I shoot off the email and Immediately after shooting off the email I discover the problem happens every time.

41
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:08,920
Scott: so it's happened.

42
00:03:09,001 --> 00:03:09,967
Scott: So and it's like Kevin.

43
00:03:09,987 --> 00:03:11,780
Scott: so it feels like it happens very very often to me.

44
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:15,115
Scott: I send the email and then solve it and I wish I hadn't sent the email.

45
00:03:15,135 --> 00:03:16,240
Scott: but you can't pull email back.

46
00:03:16,641 --> 00:03:23,886
Rym: Yeah, anyway, in fact, I remember way back when we first moved into beacon you ordered that let the cunt the Leatherman Mm-hmm and didn't arrive.

47
00:03:24,307 --> 00:03:28,900
Rym: and then you said told Amazon there's like the early days of Amazon like I was buying stuff on it.

48
00:03:28,941 --> 00:03:36,060
Rym: You were like, hey I didn't get my Leatherman and they sent another one and it literally arrived the day you sent that email and we got two Leatherman's.

49
00:03:36,861 --> 00:03:38,768
Scott: Yeah, well, but it was horribly destroyed.

50
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:41,198
Scott: Yeah, so that package definitely went through the ringer.

51
00:03:41,298 --> 00:03:47,688
Scott: anyway the point is that What happened to this package?

52
00:03:47,768 --> 00:03:47,949
Scott: Why?

53
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:48,955
Scott: why was it not here?

54
00:03:49,035 --> 00:03:49,900
Scott: Why was it delivered?

55
00:03:50,422 --> 00:03:56,084
Scott: So it had been so long since I had used CD Japan That I didn't.

56
00:03:56,144 --> 00:04:05,180
Scott: I was I was careless and I didn't check the ad the shipping address or the billing address And usually you don't have to because they'll catch you and be like, hey, we're not delivering there.

57
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,732
Scott: That doesn't match your credit card or whatever, but I didn't.

58
00:04:08,334 --> 00:04:08,857
Scott: they just sent.

59
00:04:08,917 --> 00:04:09,500
Scott: they just sent it.

60
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,911
Rym: I know why the credit card is super lax on that.

61
00:04:13,111 --> 00:04:13,914
Rym: in the last they're getting.

62
00:04:13,934 --> 00:04:16,894
Scott: they used to be very strict And now they're very very lax.

63
00:04:16,995 --> 00:04:20,850
Scott: Yeah So Was it sent to my previous apartment?

64
00:04:20,951 --> 00:04:25,220
Scott: if that's the case I could have just biked over there You know walked over there and got in the package, right?

65
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,859
Scott: Just rung the doorbell or whatever seen it there or you know contact the person who lives in that apartment.

66
00:04:29,899 --> 00:04:31,905
Scott: now No, it was not sent there.

67
00:04:31,925 --> 00:04:33,971
Scott: All right, where was it sent?

68
00:04:34,272 --> 00:04:40,860
Scott: Apparently the last time I ordered anything from CD Japan It was I was working at my previous job at Broadway calm.

69
00:04:42,121 --> 00:04:47,100
Rym: My company specifically disallows anyone having anything delivered to the office?

70
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:50,860
Scott: My current company does but Broadway calm didn't and I wouldn't do it.

71
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:59,520
Scott: I wouldn't abuse it and do it too often But I would do it for things like something from Japan that I don't want to get stolen right on my doorstep Right, so I did it occasionally.

72
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,220
Scott: So that's the address they had on file and it got sent to the Broadway calm office.

73
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,612
Scott: So I tried to call them and no one was there.

74
00:05:06,913 --> 00:05:08,199
Rym: Well, that actually makes sense.

75
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:23,218
Scott: Yeah, I know that a Broadway is closed that I know a lot of people at that company have been furloughed because Broadway is closed And I know that I was just very very lucky in my timing of deciding to change jobs about two years ago.

76
00:05:23,298 --> 00:05:27,800
Scott: if I had Not done so I might be in trouble right now, right?

77
00:05:30,481 --> 00:05:33,933
Scott: So, yeah that package presumably is in that building somewhere.

78
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:40,280
Scott: it could just be like Sitting on a desk or maybe no one's at the on the floor.

79
00:05:40,401 --> 00:05:43,880
Scott: Maybe it's at like the the door person at the bottom of the building has it.

80
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,380
Scott: I don't know who has it over there got to do a high even let's break in and guy left.

81
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,650
Scott: I left a voicemail right and no one got back to me.

82
00:05:51,172 --> 00:05:53,680
Scott: So I might have to like figure out who to email.

83
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,635
Scott: I don't know who's still there to email even if I did email.

84
00:05:58,117 --> 00:06:01,500
Scott: so yeah It's it's gonna be interesting trying to get the package.

85
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,840
Scott: Like if I just go and get it, it's gonna look like I'm going into a building and stealing a package.

86
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,657
Rym: Yeah, you know, it's interesting that who do you email problem?

87
00:06:08,717 --> 00:06:31,620
Rym: Cuz There's not a problem now like I'm pretty much set in my career But when I was trying to get a bigger job in my early days and I like applied to jobs they always wanted references from previous employers, but multiple of my previous employers had gone out of business Mmm, and a lot of these forms like required a phone number and an email address and an address and all this stuff

88
00:06:32,401 --> 00:06:33,244
Scott: For my real problem.

89
00:06:33,284 --> 00:06:33,706
Scott: Is that like?

90
00:06:33,766 --> 00:06:37,360
Scott: I go to the website and it's like the person I actually want to contact.

91
00:06:37,501 --> 00:06:37,762
Scott: It's like.

92
00:06:37,782 --> 00:06:40,780
Scott: yeah, usually they're keeping like CEOs email secret and stuff.

93
00:06:41,102 --> 00:06:46,278
Scott: It's like I want to contact the reception desk And it's hard to do that.

94
00:06:48,203 --> 00:06:53,940
Scott: Right, like the place I'm trying to contact is the place that they should be trying to make me contact instead of anyone else.

95
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:57,439
Scott: I'm not trying to contact someone to like, you know ask for a job.

96
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,528
Scott: Usually they're trying to sell anything.

97
00:07:01,548 --> 00:07:06,562
Rym: Yeah, usually they're trying to prevent you from like bothering Tim Apple or Steve Google Exactly.

98
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:07,306
Scott: I'm not trying to do that.

99
00:07:07,346 --> 00:07:09,859
Scott: I want to talk to the reception desk where the package is.

100
00:07:10,403 --> 00:07:13,723
Rym: Didn't learn a trick a long time ago from a guy I was working with?

101
00:07:13,783 --> 00:07:21,751
Rym: he's that sales stuff, but he he would send emails to generic Common white dude name at company calm.

102
00:07:22,053 --> 00:07:45,480
Rym: because even if the company had naming conventions Usually old white dudes who work there had special exceptions and had emails like Steve at company calm And that usually worked and he actually got people to respond to him and it was a. it was something you can keep in the back of your head if you know that the CEO of a company is an old white dude, and you'll want to get in contact with that person and you know their first name.

103
00:07:46,421 --> 00:07:52,140
Scott: Yep, but the thing is usually that works at certain size companies, but when you get really big, right?

104
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:57,324
Rym: if you know it goes to like the administrative assistant of Executive management group.

105
00:07:57,404 --> 00:07:59,550
Scott: right if you email like just me.

106
00:07:59,631 --> 00:08:06,817
Scott: if I send an email to like Jeff at amazon.com or Jeff visas at Amazon.com it goes to probably someone whose job it is to read that email box.

107
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:08,183
Scott: Yep Well, it's probably.

108
00:08:08,203 --> 00:08:10,475
Scott: that's probably a job even when I worked at IBM.

109
00:08:10,575 --> 00:08:13,328
Rym: I had a shared secretary So no one could call me directly.

110
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:17,387
Rym: they would call and someone would call me and say hey This person is trying to contact you.

111
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:19,799
Rym: Do you want to talk to them or should I get rid of them?

112
00:08:21,021 --> 00:08:24,113
Scott: I would all the only time outside people try to contact me.

113
00:08:24,193 --> 00:08:35,340
Scott: Is there recruiters or They are a vendor that I have already worked with and has my email Like like, you know, it's like you start, you know manage like I'm managing like, you know Oz stuff.

114
00:08:35,441 --> 00:08:36,830
Scott: I'm at login into the Oz account.

115
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,299
Scott: They have Oz has my email.

116
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,578
Scott: So the Oz sales associate calls me and it's like hey, hey buy some more Oz.

117
00:08:43,581 --> 00:08:45,050
Scott: It's like not got enough Oz.

118
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,760
Scott: I Know I know what I doing.

119
00:08:48,604 --> 00:08:54,478
Rym: so in some Minor news keepo and the age of wunderbeasts, which I've talked about multiple times.

120
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:57,660
Rym: on the show I think I've geeked by did it several times because they had two seasons.

121
00:08:58,661 --> 00:09:02,619
Rym: The third and final season just hit Netflix like two days ago.

122
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:05,409
Rym: So the sit that's what they wanted to do.

123
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,497
Rym: That is the end of the show that it like.

124
00:09:07,517 --> 00:09:08,340
Rym: the show is complete.

125
00:09:08,641 --> 00:09:20,874
Rym: It is exactly what it was intended to be and I have not seen season 3 but based on our season 1 and season 2 when I'm very excited about season 3 that show is just a Solid stand-up kids show and I learned something.

126
00:09:20,914 --> 00:09:22,060
Rym: remember what I geeked by did it.

127
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:28,740
Rym: I talked about how they had a character kind of just come out as gay like Not even a big deal like in the middle of a random episode.

128
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:38,698
Rym: Apparently that was literally the first time that has ever happened explicitly on a animated show in America That was rated all ages.

129
00:09:40,061 --> 00:09:51,583
Rym: Okay, that is both good news and just really really sad news Like yeah great, but really in your 2020 Like they will.

130
00:09:51,623 --> 00:09:54,212
Rym: the late 2019 was when we hit that milestone.

131
00:09:54,233 --> 00:09:56,300
Scott: Well, okay, it's like that long.

132
00:09:57,841 --> 00:10:00,933
Scott: Yeah, some ways we're ahead and in some ways we are so behind.

133
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:01,355
Scott: Yep.

134
00:10:01,736 --> 00:10:02,459
Rym: You got any other news?

135
00:10:03,821 --> 00:10:17,846
Scott: Yeah, just you know, I know we've talked in the past because we saw the first five minutes of it at Annecy that digital Annecy But the much-awaited CG Lupin the third movie known as Lupin the third Colon the first.

136
00:10:18,007 --> 00:10:20,959
Rym: I'm hoping they make Luton Lupin the third the first two.

137
00:10:21,863 --> 00:10:22,325
Scott: I hope so.

138
00:10:22,365 --> 00:10:29,894
Scott: But anyway, all for all intents and purposes appears to be a You know excellent execution of the Lupin formula.

139
00:10:29,934 --> 00:10:31,360
Scott: We're gonna know when we see the whole thing.

140
00:10:31,842 --> 00:10:34,794
Scott: It's going to be in theaters on the October 18th and 21st.

141
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,240
Scott: I think we've discussed that recently.

142
00:10:37,981 --> 00:10:39,086
Scott: That's less than a week away.

143
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:41,597
Scott: if theaters where you live or even open don't go.

144
00:10:41,617 --> 00:10:43,404
Scott: right We wouldn't.

145
00:10:43,524 --> 00:10:44,768
Scott: but our theaters are closed.

146
00:10:44,808 --> 00:10:45,289
Scott: we can't go.

147
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:49,718
Scott: so if their decisions made for us they're open in New Jersey right.

148
00:10:50,841 --> 00:11:01,297
Scott: So my plan was of course just wait until it was available somehow digitally or you know Maybe even hope someone else gets a bure and rips it or get a bure rip it and sell it.

149
00:11:01,317 --> 00:11:03,591
Scott: a book off Right.

150
00:11:05,141 --> 00:11:20,532
Scott: But it has now been announced G kids is gonna put it on digital Which is the kind of did not the digital Netflix kind the kind where you go to Amazon or iTunes or somewhere like that or YouTube and Pay money to download it and then you can watch it as many times as you want.

151
00:11:20,552 --> 00:11:34,620
Scott: So it'll probably cost 15 bucks plus who knows That will be on December 15th and the boo rays and the guest steel book Which is just Booray in a fancy case is going to be those will be available on January 12.

152
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,593
Rym: This deal book comes with an exclusive 18 by 24 inch lithograph.

153
00:11:40,441 --> 00:11:42,187
Scott: Yeah, I mean my days of buying.

154
00:11:42,227 --> 00:11:43,793
Scott: those were brief area out.

155
00:11:44,274 --> 00:11:53,323
Scott: In fact 15 plus years ago 100% of the lithographs I owned were Star Wars lithographs I think the only fancy I say.

156
00:11:53,403 --> 00:11:57,208
Scott: I bought a Trigon DVD that had a thing of some kind in it.

157
00:11:57,769 --> 00:12:01,440
Scott: I bought a Macross box set that had a thing in it.

158
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,489
Rym: Oh, no, I bought those lithographs standalone.

159
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:05,517
Rym: I paid like 20 bucks for these.

160
00:12:05,738 --> 00:12:06,882
Scott: talking about DVDs.

161
00:12:06,943 --> 00:12:08,810
Scott: I bought that had special stuff, right?

162
00:12:09,151 --> 00:12:10,056
Scott: So I think that had the.

163
00:12:10,156 --> 00:12:11,383
Rym: I had the eye of Vogler.

164
00:12:11,443 --> 00:12:13,151
Rym: that came with my job That's true.

165
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:19,107
Scott: I had a Voltron the first season first season of Voltron and first season of Transformers.

166
00:12:19,227 --> 00:12:20,330
Scott: both had stuff in them.

167
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:24,785
Scott: Yeah, and then Gundam seed, I guess I had a box that I slowly filled that had stuff.

168
00:12:24,825 --> 00:12:27,810
Scott: and those I guess the only DVDs I bought with stuff.

169
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,212
Scott: Oh, right.

170
00:12:28,232 --> 00:12:32,210
Rym: You bought Gundam seed with the box that came with DVD one and then you filled the box with that.

171
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,621
Scott: I filled it is yeah, and now that's all gone.

172
00:12:34,641 --> 00:12:36,550
Scott: I I have the D. I have the discs.

173
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:37,313
Scott: I don't Wow.

174
00:12:37,353 --> 00:12:41,670
Rym: Remember when shows would come out like episode by episode or DVD by DVD?

175
00:12:41,891 --> 00:12:46,210
Scott: What a those those DVDs had four episodes on him, I think so they were not a bad deal.

176
00:12:46,655 --> 00:12:47,950
Rym: I mean, that was the old anime thing.

177
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:52,449
Rym: You'd get a VHS or a DVD would have four episodes and they'd come out about once a month.

178
00:12:52,971 --> 00:12:58,590
Rym: See you basically had to either have the discipline to only watch one episode a week or you'd get that DVD.

179
00:12:58,952 --> 00:13:03,772
Rym: You'd watch all four episodes and they just say fuck cuz there's a cliffhanger and wait a month Mm-hmm.

180
00:13:04,716 --> 00:13:09,255
Scott: Yeah, those are the only DVDs ever bought with special stuff and I'm surprised They still make those and that someone still buys.

181
00:13:09,336 --> 00:13:11,261
Rym: people love that stuff.

182
00:13:12,004 --> 00:13:12,304
Scott: All right.

183
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:14,170
Scott: Well, yeah, I love this movie.

184
00:13:14,271 --> 00:13:15,719
Scott: I hope like very likely.

185
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,610
Scott: so we're gonna be doing an episode on it.

186
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:22,470
Scott: You can expect the first Wednesday after December 15th that there is a GeekNights episode.

187
00:13:22,671 --> 00:13:24,699
Rym: They're probably will be because we're probably.

188
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:27,590
Rym: I mean, there is no way we're traveling for the holidays this year.

189
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,079
Scott: It's if go I work.

190
00:13:29,602 --> 00:13:41,128
Scott: if my job does not Increase the amount of vacation days I can hold over to 2021 in which case in 2021 I'll be going on a mega vacation as soon as that is safe to do.

191
00:13:42,452 --> 00:13:45,490
Scott: If that does not happen, I have a lot of vacation days to use in December.

192
00:13:45,611 --> 00:13:49,146
Scott: I'll basically and I already have the final week of December off from Christmas to New Year's.

193
00:13:49,266 --> 00:13:54,710
Scott: anyway by default I will basically not be working most of December if they do not increase the numbers.

194
00:13:54,830 --> 00:14:00,950
Scott: So I will definitely be watching this movie on December 15th, which probably be a day that I won't be working.

195
00:14:02,391 --> 00:14:03,577
Rym: So some other news.

196
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:09,760
Rym: if you're not familiar with this because it's in Queens It is there is a museum called the Museum of the moving image.

197
00:14:10,442 --> 00:14:13,010
Scott: This is really funny about this museum.

198
00:14:13,535 --> 00:14:21,290
Scott: So this is a museum that you know I went to once and then I would go to occasionally once or twice a year for like screenings of movies or whatever.

199
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:24,530
Rym: Yeah, I always go for a screening or like a special exhibition.

200
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:31,993
Scott: That's only special exhibition or someone's visiting or you're hanging out with a new person and you take them there because they haven't been there But you've been there, right?

201
00:14:32,615 --> 00:14:43,589
Scott: So, you know, it was always this situation where you know museums have memberships, right and The deal with the museum membership is that if you go enough or you attend enough of their events It ends up paying for itself.

202
00:14:44,073 --> 00:14:48,620
Scott: All right, yeah, and you get you get to cut the line and you you know You can just go to the museum for free.

203
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,350
Scott: You don't have to pay tickets every time.

204
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,847
Rym: It's the kind of thing you do especially like botanical gardens are good place.

205
00:14:54,028 --> 00:15:04,200
Scott: Oh, yeah Exactly, exactly any sort of physical location, you know arts and educational Institution place right museums galleries that sort of thing.

206
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:07,329
Scott: So like a special libraries, right?

207
00:15:07,992 --> 00:15:14,073
Scott: So I would calculate every year like how many times did I go cuz it's I can walk there It's super.

208
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:15,980
Scott: I can city bike there in five to ten minutes.

209
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:16,382
Scott: It's right.

210
00:15:16,462 --> 00:15:19,282
Rym: Yeah, you're way close to it even compared to us And it's a short walk.

211
00:15:19,342 --> 00:15:19,667
Rym: for us.

212
00:15:20,971 --> 00:15:21,954
Scott: It's pretty equidistant.

213
00:15:22,094 --> 00:15:22,876
Scott: It's like a triangular.

214
00:15:23,057 --> 00:15:24,200
Rym: Anyway, I think you're close up.

215
00:15:24,943 --> 00:15:25,765
Scott: Who knows Google.

216
00:15:25,785 --> 00:15:31,240
Scott: my point is while you're talking Okay, the point is I would calculate was the membership worth it?

217
00:15:31,361 --> 00:15:34,670
Scott: and it was always pretty borderline whether the membership was worth it, right?

218
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:40,347
Scott: So this year I was like, I think last year I think the membership would have been worth it.

219
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:41,432
Scott: the number of times I went.

220
00:15:41,452 --> 00:15:43,909
Rym: because I think oh, so you finally pulled the trigger.

221
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:48,400
Scott: 2020 was the year the beginning of 2020.

222
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,489
Scott: I got a membership and then I went to Paxie.

223
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:58,161
Scott: That's definitely a shame Because 2019 the met it would have.

224
00:15:58,261 --> 00:16:06,130
Rym: if I would have been member at 2019 I would have saved money, but I we have seen some kind of amazing stuff at the museum over the years.

225
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:09,456
Rym: It's a fantastic museum like give you example of what this place is like.

226
00:16:09,797 --> 00:16:21,489
Rym: it is one of the only places in New York that can actually Play like scream a nitrite trade print like those old film stocks Mmm, like it has a bunch of cool stuff like that.

227
00:16:21,911 --> 00:16:29,507
Scott: You can see everything there from a complete collection of Star Wars toys To actual models of.

228
00:16:29,527 --> 00:16:35,252
Scott: you know Those buildings and Blade Runner and the in the scenes where it's like showing you the cameras going over all these, you know The cyber city.

229
00:16:35,493 --> 00:16:35,633
Scott: right.

230
00:16:35,654 --> 00:16:38,061
Scott: they have the actual models that were filmed.

231
00:16:38,563 --> 00:16:45,047
Scott: They got all sorts of you know, ridiculous stuff there That is amazing and they screen movies and 70 millimeter regularly.

232
00:16:45,067 --> 00:16:47,174
Scott: Yeah You know, so

233
00:16:47,495 --> 00:16:52,088
Rym: what they are doing is they're not doing so hot because the kovat obviously and

234
00:16:52,128 --> 00:17:00,010
Scott: right the current Current exhibit was like a big 2001 exhibit because they show that movie a lot because they have a 70 millimeter print and people go to see it occasionally.

235
00:17:00,836 --> 00:17:04,796
Scott: They had the actual babby I saw.

236
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:05,398
Scott: I went to the.

237
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,029
Scott: we went to the exhibit before they closed it.

238
00:17:08,391 --> 00:17:10,662
Scott: But I mean they get before the museum closed.

239
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:12,470
Rym: so they doing so hot.

240
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:27,015
Rym: So they have a Kickstarter that just launched to help them fund a bunch of online stuff and get things going To try to bring as much of their content as they can to people during kovat and also kind of to help them survive Until post kovat.

241
00:17:27,376 --> 00:17:29,543
Scott: they have a lot of awesome stuff like that.

242
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:30,426
Scott: You see the awesome stuff.

243
00:17:30,446 --> 00:17:31,450
Scott: That's on display there.

244
00:17:31,691 --> 00:17:32,981
Scott: They have a lot of awesome stuff.

245
00:17:33,001 --> 00:17:34,170
Scott: That is not on display.

246
00:17:34,712 --> 00:17:44,329
Rym: Yeah, like they preserve props from a bunch of famous movies, even if you can't go see them like they do Channel yeah, their YouTube channel will show you all kinds of good stuff.

247
00:17:45,372 --> 00:17:46,816
Rym: So, yep, so I.

248
00:17:47,056 --> 00:17:50,124
Scott: and they also have lots of amazing video game exhibits.

249
00:17:50,164 --> 00:17:50,906
Scott: because it's not like.

250
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,116
Scott: it's not a movie museum it's a the.

251
00:17:53,217 --> 00:17:56,653
Scott: it's a the Moving image.

252
00:17:56,693 --> 00:17:59,461
Scott: So any moving image animation, right?

253
00:18:00,042 --> 00:18:02,529
Scott: They have a whole exist a little section there where they show you.

254
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,892
Scott: there's like a Live.

255
00:18:05,913 --> 00:18:08,566
Scott: it's like basically a fake TV studio there.

256
00:18:08,646 --> 00:18:17,047
Scott: that shows you What it would look like if you were sitting in the tractor trailer outside the baseball stadium Controlling the broadcast for the baseball game.

257
00:18:17,148 --> 00:18:19,056
Rym: Yeah So they.

258
00:18:19,096 --> 00:18:21,926
Rym: so the rewards like are the reason.

259
00:18:21,946 --> 00:18:26,710
Rym: part of the reason I'm bringing this up Is that this museum is really important and it really needs to survive.

260
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:32,190
Scott: The other reason I bring it up is that the real neighborhoods gonna be way crappier if it closes.

261
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:37,009
Rym: The rewards are pretty interesting because they're trying to be clever with it.

262
00:18:37,331 --> 00:18:43,070
Rym: Like at one tier they give you like special zoom backgrounds and twitch emotes like they know the deal.

263
00:18:43,973 --> 00:18:49,210
Rym: The $20 tier is a bread baking demonstration with some famous people.

264
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:53,301
Rym: Okay, like they're gonna basically have a limited number of people.

265
00:18:53,322 --> 00:18:59,769
Rym: like sit in the zoom call and like learn how to make bread with some fancy people Copies of some publications they put together.

266
00:19:00,451 --> 00:19:00,693
Rym: There's.

267
00:19:00,854 --> 00:19:03,069
Rym: it's a bunch of cool interesting stuff.

268
00:19:03,819 --> 00:19:16,323
Rym: But yeah if you care about moving images in any way like if you want to in the year 2060 be able to go to this place and see an exhibit on the rise of animated gifs This is the kind of museum that'll have that they already

269
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:17,550
Scott: had a gif exhibit.

270
00:19:20,074 --> 00:19:21,019
Scott: They had the whole front.

271
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:32,750
Scott: what when you walked in in the entranceway They basically were using projectors and there was some sort of installation thing that had like memes all the way down The front though because most of the walls in the museum and the main areas are white.

272
00:19:33,251 --> 00:19:44,110
Scott: So they're broadcasting this whole, you know meme gift type thing all over the front wall behind the The ticket booth, you know, I guess in front of the the ticket desks or whatever.

273
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:45,735
Rym: Yep, the building is just cool to like.

274
00:19:45,755 --> 00:19:49,266
Rym: the stairways are disorienting like it's a. it's an interesting one.

275
00:19:49,306 --> 00:19:50,449
Scott: disorienting stairway.

276
00:19:50,973 --> 00:19:51,802
Rym: What is there?

277
00:19:51,842 --> 00:19:52,489
Scott: another stairway?

278
00:19:53,452 --> 00:19:54,849
Scott: there's the.

279
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,855
Scott: I Mean the one you're gonna use.

280
00:19:56,915 --> 00:19:57,740
Scott: is that big white one?

281
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,026
Scott: Yeah, there are.

282
00:19:59,046 --> 00:20:02,941
Scott: there are like yeah But there are like fire escape type ones behind the doors you can use.

283
00:20:03,122 --> 00:20:05,009
Rym: Oh, yeah, I guess they're just normal stairwells.

284
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:06,094
Scott: Yeah, they're just normal stairs.

285
00:20:06,114 --> 00:20:09,569
Scott: They're not exciting like the disorienting stairway like don't they had the one.

286
00:20:10,971 --> 00:20:15,625
Rym: You'll see when you get if you've never been there when you finally get to this museum You'll see what I mean about that one stairway.

287
00:20:16,331 --> 00:20:23,177
Scott: It's just interesting like for example like a lot of like these quirky like indie video game Installations that I'll see at places like magfest.

288
00:20:23,318 --> 00:20:25,645
Scott: I'll then see at museum of the movie.

289
00:20:25,665 --> 00:20:25,806
Scott: Yep.

290
00:20:25,926 --> 00:20:29,156
Scott: All right All right.

291
00:20:30,851 --> 00:20:32,017
Scott: But anyway, I think of the day.

292
00:20:32,318 --> 00:20:33,022
Scott: what about my thing?

293
00:20:33,042 --> 00:20:34,550
Rym: is that wasn't my thing of the day that was just news.

294
00:20:34,931 --> 00:20:35,775
Scott: Oh, I thought that was.

295
00:20:35,895 --> 00:20:36,558
Rym: that pause was.

296
00:20:36,578 --> 00:20:38,626
Rym: so I can just slide the thing of the day thing right in there.

297
00:20:38,646 --> 00:20:39,609
Rym: Okay?

298
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:44,610
Rym: but anyway things Of the day I decided arbitrarily.

299
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:47,241
Rym: I'm only doing spooky things of the day for the rest of October.

300
00:20:47,261 --> 00:20:49,450
Scott: cuz I don't have enough spooky things of the day.

301
00:20:49,731 --> 00:20:50,696
Rym: Oh, that means I'm gonna have.

302
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:51,580
Rym: I'm gonna have to force it.

303
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,629
Rym: I'm gonna have to find spooky things.

304
00:20:54,313 --> 00:21:10,900
Rym: So, okay, my thing of the day is a 14-second tick-tock But it encapsulates my love of pranks following up from your skeleton prank one a couple days ago Very simple classic prank a prank that my uncle Performed on my mom when they were kids.

305
00:21:11,282 --> 00:21:17,305
Rym: to similar effect a prank that Parents and grandparents in my family have performed throughout the years.

306
00:21:17,366 --> 00:21:18,230
Rym: It's a very simple prank.

307
00:21:19,093 --> 00:21:39,505
Rym: The caption is my daughter's upstairs playing Ouija with her friends and it's obviously a dad and he's walking around like live streaming on his phone and tick-tock and he goes over to the circuit breaker and he goes up to The upstairs circuit breaker and he jiggles it a little bit and in the distance You hear a bunch of like six-year-old girls screaming and that's it.

308
00:21:39,866 --> 00:21:40,087
Rym: Mm-hmm.

309
00:21:40,729 --> 00:21:43,353
Rym: Okay What do you got?

310
00:21:43,513 --> 00:21:44,477
Scott: that's it that's alright.

311
00:21:44,537 --> 00:21:50,790
Scott: so, uh, I don't know, you know people are probably aware of this Especially people listening to a Wednesday GeekNights, right?

312
00:21:51,292 --> 00:21:54,670
Scott: But you know Japan has a declining birth rate situation.

313
00:21:54,770 --> 00:22:02,270
Scott: Their population is getting older and their population is moving to cities and away from you know, rural places, right?

314
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:12,952
Scott: So you watch a lot of anime or you watch Japanese media and you'll always see portrayals of like, you know seaside village or oceanside village or you know Stuff like that.

315
00:22:13,313 --> 00:22:18,930
Scott: and those places like a lot of them are going to like completely disappear as no one lives there anymore, right?

316
00:22:19,532 --> 00:22:31,770
Scott: I think I read somewhere like a large some what percentage it was they predicted for like the next x-years of just abandoned Japanese villages in rural places that like no one literally no one will live there anymore.

317
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:33,696
Rym: I mean America.

318
00:22:33,756 --> 00:22:38,029
Rym: a similar revolution like there are a lot of ghost towns in the West sure.

319
00:22:39,171 --> 00:22:45,550
Scott: So another result of this is that of course there was a lot of infrastructure built that becomes abandoned.

320
00:22:45,711 --> 00:22:49,530
Scott: And of course one of the things that's gonna be abandoned when the birth rate declines is schools.

321
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:50,655
Scott: You just don't need is met.

322
00:22:50,675 --> 00:22:54,070
Scott: you had a bunch of schools when you had a bunch of kids and now you don't have any kids.

323
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:56,782
Scott: Anymore, it's like we don't need all these school buildings anymore.

324
00:22:56,802 --> 00:22:59,811
Rym: Yeah, because the room of golf is empty Right.

325
00:22:59,952 --> 00:23:05,609
Scott: So I've seen I've seen some people actually turn schools into like haunted attractions because you know school.

326
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:13,993
Scott: Horror is a genre right, you know getting scared into school building, but here this video it's like a travel.

327
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:18,389
Scott: it's like a travel log video on YouTube by this person Sherry why?

328
00:23:18,409 --> 00:23:24,710
Scott: and They're on this Japanese island and the island had a school that is now empty.

329
00:23:24,891 --> 00:23:28,150
Scott: I guess people are moving away from the island or the population is aging.

330
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:41,770
Scott: It's you know an example of this happening for real and instead of being turned into some horror Situation right like an amusement park the old abandoned school on the Japanese island has been turned into a lovely cafe.

331
00:23:43,812 --> 00:23:58,668
Scott: So here's a lovely travelogue video at the abandoned school cafe and I hope we can see the malls of the United States end up like this and not end up like Who knows what?

332
00:24:01,002 --> 00:24:01,946
Rym: Alright in the meta moment.

333
00:24:01,986 --> 00:24:04,720
Rym: We're uh stuck at home still so I don't know what you want.

334
00:24:04,881 --> 00:24:06,980
Rym: We can't really do much except what we're already doing.

335
00:24:07,442 --> 00:24:12,360
Rym: But I did upload if you want to see the panel we gave at pecs online.

336
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:19,188
Rym: I've uploaded a director's cut because there were very specific Rules and formatting for how I put together.

337
00:24:19,228 --> 00:24:32,720
Rym: the one we actually like did sound like pseudo live at pecs So that one they have a VOD in the middle of this like eight hour video you can watch But this is a standalone one edited and cut together the way we normally edit and cut together our panels.

338
00:24:33,321 --> 00:24:35,504
Rym: So you want to see our brand new talk?

339
00:24:35,785 --> 00:24:37,067

Rym: All right Our other talks coming soon.

345
00:24:44,462 --> 00:24:46,780
Scott: The book club book is still technically the tale of Genji.

346
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:54,721
Rym: I guess the last fiction I've read in my life is still some pages of the tale of Genji on the train home Sam's Same.

347
00:24:54,761 --> 00:24:56,808
Scott: if you don't count like, you know comics or whatever.

348
00:24:56,928 --> 00:25:01,503
Scott: Yeah, pretty much reading or nonfiction or something on the internet That was a lie.

349
00:25:01,784 --> 00:25:02,829
Scott: That would count as fiction.

350
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:03,973
Rym: Oh, yeah, I guess that's true.

351
00:25:03,994 --> 00:25:05,500
Rym: I mean to half my Twitter timeline.

352
00:25:06,722 --> 00:25:10,849
Rym: Yeah But yeah, no cons whatever we don't.

354
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:18,110
Rym: Yeah type the word coming nice into you into Google or YouTube.

355
00:25:18,411 --> 00:25:24,558
Rym: in fact type the word GeekNights into any text prompt you have and Something good will come of it something bad.

356
00:25:25,741 --> 00:25:30,036
Scott: If there's a place on the internet if there's an app you use you can find us on that app probably.

357
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:32,209
Scott: so I mean if you Really need our help for that.

358
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,400
Scott: You already found this podcast.

359
00:25:33,582 --> 00:25:46,966
Rym: In fact, if there is an app you use Where you think somehow us being on that app would work and enrich your life and we're not on that app I want to know what the fuck that app is and why you're using it Seriously.

Scott: I don't know.

363
00:25:56,141 --> 00:26:01,240
Scott: So we got a crunchy roll and I click on shows in the top left and I scroll down and I look at all the shows.

364
00:26:02,301 --> 00:26:03,566
Rym: Scott I are like look I start.

365
00:26:03,586 --> 00:26:07,278
Scott: well, I do what we do and I'm judging anime by its cover.

366
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:09,586
Scott: I'm judging I'm just judge a judge and I'm like, nope.

367
00:26:09,626 --> 00:26:09,786
Scott: Nope.

368
00:26:09,826 --> 00:26:10,027
Scott: Nope.

369
00:26:10,147 --> 00:26:10,308
Scott: Nope.

370
00:26:10,348 --> 00:26:10,889
Scott: Nope.

371
00:26:10,929 --> 00:26:11,110
Scott: Nope.

372
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:14,480
Rym: I wanted to watch decadence, but it's not on c-roll.

373
00:26:14,581 --> 00:26:15,164
Rym: So I'm gonna wait.

374
00:26:15,465 --> 00:26:22,340
Scott: I yeah, we have heard many people, you know It's getting to the point where I've heard several people say something's up with that decadence show.

375
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,495
Scott: That's worth watching and now it's on my list.

376
00:26:24,555 --> 00:26:25,039
Scott: It's in the queue.

377
00:26:26,062 --> 00:26:33,953
Scott: So maybe if you're out there looking for a show to watch I can't tell you if it's good or not But I can tell you the word on the street is that decadence is a show worth watching.

378
00:26:33,993 --> 00:26:35,940
Rym: buzz about buzz is persisting.

379
00:26:36,801 --> 00:26:39,131
Scott: Yes, so that is not the show that we were talking about today.

380
00:26:39,572 --> 00:26:49,920
Scott: I scrolled down and I saw a very interesting Image because all you're seeing on the crunchyroll shows page is basically movie posters Right sample thumbnails for shows and it looked really fascinating.

381
00:26:50,061 --> 00:26:51,085
Scott: It looks somewhat vapor.

382
00:26:51,125 --> 00:26:54,840
Rym: when I was about to say when you said wrote you were like, oh look at this one.

383
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,543
Rym: And I looked at it.

384
00:26:55,623 --> 00:26:58,135
Rym: My first thought was some kind of vaporwave anime.

385
00:26:58,175 --> 00:26:59,280
Scott: what right?

386
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,912
Scott: It looked this poster looked with a vaporwave aesthetic.

387
00:27:01,972 --> 00:27:08,040
Scott: because you know, the the Statuesque, you know Greek bust is often used in vaporwave imagery.

388
00:27:09,141 --> 00:27:13,113
Scott: But no, it was actually about Greek stuff and also about like the Olympics.

389
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,540
Scott: and I was like, oh is this like a promotional anime?

390
00:27:16,781 --> 00:27:22,399
Scott: For you know, the Japanese Tokyo Olympics that is somehow incorporating, you know, Greek stuff.

391
00:27:22,962 --> 00:27:37,980
Scott: but also the look of it gave me strong vibes of This sort of you know Yes, that's sort of gag manga B or E nonsense Japanese comedic style that we like a whole lot.

392
00:27:38,622 --> 00:27:39,867
Scott: So I'm like, well, how about?

393
00:27:39,948 --> 00:27:42,880
Scott: I said Rym and I say Rym look at this one and he's like, that's the one.

394
00:27:44,221 --> 00:27:45,446
Scott: We're doing a show on that.

395
00:27:45,526 --> 00:27:46,229
Scott: So here we are.

396
00:27:46,269 --> 00:27:48,137
Scott: We're gonna talk today about what's this thing called?

397
00:27:48,518 --> 00:27:54,224
Rym: It is called Oh God red extra olympia kikilos And it's a.

398
00:27:54,345 --> 00:27:55,291
Scott: it's one of those shows.

399
00:27:55,311 --> 00:27:56,700
Scott: the episodes are only five minutes.

400
00:27:57,141 --> 00:28:03,117
Scott: There are 21 episodes on crunchyroll as of this moment, but the Wikipedia says there are 24 episodes.

401
00:28:04,622 --> 00:28:08,760
Scott: I don't know if the remaining three are just not out yet or if they're just not on crunchyroll yet.

402
00:28:09,244 --> 00:28:10,739
Scott: And there's also a manga that it's based on.

403
00:28:11,201 --> 00:28:25,404
Rym: so the first thing I got to say is that like I actually want to read the description the official description of the show because To meet Rose was a young man in ancient Greece who was a potter's apprentice, but also rather timid otaku Despite pursuing the arts.

404
00:28:25,424 --> 00:28:28,792
Rym: He was blessed with natural athletic talents one day.

405
00:28:29,113 --> 00:28:33,766
Rym: He gets dragged into a village conflicts Yada yada yada.

406
00:28:34,008 --> 00:28:34,973
Rym: somehow he ends up in 1964 Tokyo.

407
00:28:38,062 --> 00:28:42,260
Rym: It sounds like a like a typical anime where there's gonna be some like pot going on.

408
00:28:42,823 --> 00:28:46,020
Rym: But then when you watch it, they're five minute long episodes.

409
00:28:46,904 --> 00:28:50,160
Rym: It's a combination of limited animation and stop-motion.

410
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,326
Scott: This it's like claymation.

411
00:28:52,667 --> 00:28:53,569
Rym: I say five minutes.

412
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:57,300
Rym: It is five minutes including the full-length opener and full-length closer.

413
00:28:57,936 --> 00:29:01,395
Scott: Yeah Everything that happens in ancient Greece is stop-motion claymation.

414
00:29:01,435 --> 00:29:10,069
Scott: the stuff that happens in modern Japan is the claymation Greek guy with 2d flat Japanese, you know, it's 60s.

415
00:29:10,089 --> 00:29:11,213
Scott: Japan is no modern Japan.

416
00:29:11,253 --> 00:29:12,418
Rym: Yeah, it's 1964 Tokyo, right?

417
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,167
Rym: Okay, Tokyo police, right?

418
00:29:15,187 --> 00:29:15,689
Scott: So Tokyo is 1964.

419
00:29:15,689 --> 00:29:16,372
Scott: Everything's flat and 2d.

420
00:29:18,761 --> 00:29:19,182
Rym: You know what?

421
00:29:19,202 --> 00:29:20,045
Rym: It looks like a lot.

422
00:29:20,226 --> 00:29:26,043
Rym: It really is reminiscent of the animation style of yamashibai Mmm, like.

423
00:29:26,304 --> 00:29:32,100
Rym: it's really unique like it's clearly 2d like when the old man like turns to look at Dimitrios.

424
00:29:32,381 --> 00:29:35,010
Rym: He's clearly a two-dimensional like piece of paper.

425
00:29:36,012 --> 00:29:37,750
Scott: Yep, I mean there was a seat as a scene.

426
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,921
Scott: I don't think you saw this scene because I don't think you watch this many up.

427
00:29:40,002 --> 00:29:42,033
Scott: I only got up to episode 12.

428
00:29:42,033 --> 00:29:44,390
Scott: They're playing volleyball and they do a parody of.

429
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:45,592
Scott: Is it?

430
00:29:45,632 --> 00:29:46,737
Scott: was it attack number one?

431
00:29:46,797 --> 00:29:48,444
Scott: is the Japanese right?

432
00:29:48,504 --> 00:29:50,030
Scott: Is that what it's called attack number one?

433
00:29:51,631 --> 00:29:53,910
Scott: Yeah, I didn't say number one is the volleyball anime.

434
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:59,733
Scott: There's a very brief scene where they're parodying attack number one and all these basically thin You know.

435
00:30:00,255 --> 00:30:00,537
Scott: 2d.

436
00:30:00,838 --> 00:30:03,170
Scott: pictures of volleyball playing high school girls.

437
00:30:03,692 --> 00:30:06,567
Scott: There are strings you can see that are making them move up and down.

438
00:30:06,587 --> 00:30:15,630
Rym: Yeah right Yeah, you can even see strings when I throw in the beans at the school festival Like you see strings pulling the beans like up and down again.

439
00:30:16,571 --> 00:30:16,812
Scott: Yep.

440
00:30:16,973 --> 00:30:17,174
Scott: Yep.

441
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:21,675
Rym: It is super low-budget, but I gotta say It's legit.

442
00:30:21,715 --> 00:30:23,247
Rym: This show is funny as shit.

443
00:30:25,012 --> 00:30:25,797
Scott: How could it not be?

444
00:30:25,817 --> 00:30:28,190
Scott: you could tell that and we knew that just from the time the gate.

445
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:39,345
Rym: There are a lot of shows like this that end up not actually being that funny Like the jokes are really telegraphed or they move really slow Like I have seen short quirky looking shows like this that just aren't actually that good.

446
00:30:39,365 --> 00:30:39,445
Rym: Yeah.

447
00:30:39,987 --> 00:30:40,568
Scott: What was the one?

448
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:45,890
Scott: What was the one where the guy was an alien and was like just really really good at everything in life?

449
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:49,550
Rym: Oh, yeah, the prince whatever like he was the prince of the school.

450
00:30:49,831 --> 00:30:52,203
Scott: I forget I forget what it was called even though I watched the whole thing.

451
00:30:52,324 --> 00:30:54,828
Rym: only the first episode was funny And then it just to kind of petered out.

452
00:30:55,591 --> 00:30:59,304
Scott: Right, but then you have other ones like Cromartie, which just stay good the whole time.

453
00:30:59,324 --> 00:30:59,485
Scott: Yep.

454
00:30:59,826 --> 00:31:00,930
Rym: This is more like Cromartie.

455
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:04,081
Rym: It is just yeah, if you think you see where it's going.

456
00:31:04,141 --> 00:31:06,650
Rym: It kind of just rolls past that it jumps all there.

457
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:18,670
Scott: However, while while also while having that same sort of you know, Japanese humor style as Cromartie There is a contiguous plot that makes sense and they stick with it and follow on it.

458
00:31:19,051 --> 00:31:25,170
Scott: It's just that all of the interactions with that plot are these you know, ridiculous characters acting ridiculously.

459
00:31:25,732 --> 00:31:28,981
Scott: But the main, you know story and motivation.

460
00:31:29,001 --> 00:31:31,247
Rym: the mayor who's a piece of shit, right?

461
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,534
Scott: There's a mayor in the town.

462
00:31:33,574 --> 00:31:39,430
Scott: They're in a they're in a poor ocean side village, right and the mayor wants money.

463
00:31:41,014 --> 00:31:47,930
Scott: And there's you know They want to hold an Olympic style event to make money because he heard other people are having Olympics.

464
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:49,677
Rym: Why don't we have some Olympics Dimitri?

465
00:31:49,717 --> 00:31:51,323
Rym: That's all you suck at your job.

466
00:31:51,665 --> 00:31:59,007
Scott: make the Olympics happen instead Right, and there's all sorts of conflicts involving like Spartans who are way too strong and scary.

467
00:31:59,027 --> 00:32:00,170
Rym: really funny, right?

468
00:32:00,492 --> 00:32:10,425
Scott: There are the people who hold the actual Olympics right coming after them and you think oh, this is a show like that's sponsored somehow by the actual Olympics Like it's like no.

469
00:32:10,445 --> 00:32:10,850
Scott: No, it is not.

470
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:17,550
Scott: This show is like basically calling out in several episodes like how you know The Olympics is tainted by sponsorship.

471
00:32:17,972 --> 00:32:22,830
Scott: The Olympic Committee is overbearing its intellectual property and strong arming people.

472
00:32:23,011 --> 00:32:25,018
Scott: It's also calling out ancient Greece.

473
00:32:25,139 --> 00:32:29,970
Rym: it like it has this whole bit where it's like the Olympics were great Except for women who weren't allowed to participate.

474
00:32:30,737 --> 00:32:40,054
Rym: yep, it's like Today I had to tell two different slaves what to do Exactly on the one hand.

475
00:32:40,074 --> 00:32:56,784
Scott: It's sort of under a punch-out esque, you know almost racist Exaggerated stereotypical depiction of ancient Greece, but also there's like these nuggets of truth Constantly bringing out right teaching you actual real things about ancient Greece.

476
00:32:56,884 --> 00:32:59,486
Scott: Yeah, it's like yeah, that was true That yeah.

477
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,640
Rym: But I guess why it's so funny is like the.

478
00:33:02,701 --> 00:33:06,418
Rym: the weird art style kind of just fits and you just roll with it Like you don't even notice it.

479
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:17,088
Rym: after we watch a couple episodes Like it just it works, but the jokes are actually they're not only real like legit funny But they're pretty dark and often extremely

480
00:33:17,168 --> 00:33:17,389
Scott: mean

481
00:33:19,011 --> 00:33:25,543
Rym: Like the characters are mostly jerks to each other except the old guy who is weirdly patient with his naked Greek man It keeps popping into his house.

482
00:33:26,912 --> 00:33:27,955
Scott: Yeah, well, that's the thing.

483
00:33:27,975 --> 00:33:28,918
Scott: I think that's the the.

484
00:33:29,099 --> 00:33:35,119
Scott: that's if every single character in ancient Greece except maybe Apollonia, right?

485
00:33:35,139 --> 00:33:37,609
Scott: Yeah is sort of ridiculous in some way.

486
00:33:38,323 --> 00:33:41,779
Scott: the 1964 Japan is like the straight man.

487
00:33:41,859 --> 00:33:48,861
Scott: It's like instead of having you know, the comedy where there's you know The the the straight man and the not straight person right here.

488
00:33:49,141 --> 00:33:51,888
Scott: You have the you know, the funny man, whatever.

489
00:33:51,949 --> 00:33:54,601
Scott: right here You've got the ancient Greece is the funny man.

490
00:33:54,842 --> 00:33:59,289
Scott: It's two different settings and 1960s Japan is the not funny, right?

491
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:01,099
Scott: Everyone there has common sense, right?

492
00:34:04,234 --> 00:34:05,821
Rym: Oh, I guess we're speaking ancient Greek.

493
00:34:05,861 --> 00:34:06,926
Rym: So I guess you're from Greece.

494
00:34:07,026 --> 00:34:09,228
Rym: All right, whatever Do you want to come to the school festival?

495
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:14,726
Scott: Right, you know everyone in Japan even the kid is just like oh, you're my baseball card.

496
00:34:14,746 --> 00:34:15,710
Scott: Go ahead, right?

497
00:34:16,011 --> 00:34:17,530
Scott: They're just acting like normal people.

498
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:20,746
Scott: They're not weird in any way and they're they're very tolerant of.

499
00:34:20,766 --> 00:34:25,590
Scott: you know The one visitor from the ancient times but like like an example of the mean humor.

500
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:32,503
Rym: so the Demetrios his job is to paint vases and Like just paint, you know, they're that typically for us.

501
00:34:32,623 --> 00:34:40,969
Rym: and in for is in hydras Greek vase filled with stuff and he got those paintings on the side and Demetrios sucks at it Like he is famously bad at this.

502
00:34:41,451 --> 00:34:46,870
Scott: Well, I mean he's bad at it and that he's not doing it in the way that you see in museums, right?

503
00:34:46,949 --> 00:34:47,414
Scott: He's doing.

504
00:34:47,455 --> 00:34:49,210
Scott: it's actually like I couldn't draw like that.

505
00:34:49,311 --> 00:34:56,570
Scott: It's actually a really good drawing but it's an intentionally silly and out of style and out of character drawing for the side of a Greek vase and that's why it's

506
00:34:57,130 --> 00:35:05,598
Rym: so you get to the future and the old man has one of his vases that like survived through the ages like thousands of years and He's like, oh my art.

507
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:10,295
Rym: Ah, and the guy's like it's shit, but it was painted 2400 years ago.

508
00:35:10,736 --> 00:35:18,170
Rym: It's honestly so shitty that I hate leaving something so shitty out But it is valuable and he's just like crying the whole time.

509
00:35:20,574 --> 00:35:24,869
Rym: There's a lot of dick jokes too Like oh, yeah a lot of dick jokes.

510
00:35:25,971 --> 00:35:29,602
Scott: So my favorite joke is actually the recurring joke.

511
00:35:29,722 --> 00:35:32,370
Scott: The opener to this show is the same every time it's the same.

512
00:35:32,552 --> 00:35:41,170
Rym: I skipped a William tell overture while they have done stop-motion animation with Greek plates, basically, right?

513
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:44,201
Scott: So basically I was after the first few times seeing it.

514
00:35:44,302 --> 00:35:47,955
Scott: just to save time and get through the show faster I would skip the exact.

515
00:35:47,995 --> 00:35:49,379
Scott: it's exactly 30 seconds long.

516
00:35:49,419 --> 00:35:55,539
Scott: So I just skipped to the 32nd mark, but the closer to the show It's a god you re closer.

517
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:56,886
Scott: It is different.

518
00:35:57,026 --> 00:36:08,668
Scott: every single time There is this character who's like, you know someone so so and so Greek name the bard And it's this clay dude with a lute I guess or a harp or you know, whatever.

519
00:36:08,688 --> 00:36:09,290
Scott: something like that.

520
00:36:09,795 --> 00:36:10,666
Scott: Yeah, something like that.

521
00:36:11,834 --> 00:36:13,902
Scott: And he sings a completely different song.

522
00:36:14,324 --> 00:36:16,373
Scott: that is a completely different topic right?

523
00:36:16,393 --> 00:36:23,574
Scott: and that song teaches you something kind of or Or at least a sardonic take on something Right.

524
00:36:23,695 --> 00:36:29,101
Scott: or it's like the song always has like you have to watch the full closer The closer is telling you something that might.

525
00:36:29,181 --> 00:36:37,290
Scott: that's usually relevant to the episode You just watched or about to watch or about ancient Greece or something and they sing a whole song.

526
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:38,919
Scott: That's different song every time.

527
00:36:38,939 --> 00:36:39,924
Scott: it's like they can.

528
00:36:40,246 --> 00:36:46,454
Scott: they put behind The in the background while this claymation guy is singing Stock footage.

529
00:36:46,655 --> 00:36:52,490
Rym: public domain footage is one actor who they keep using to portray Zeus, but he kind of looks like Jesus.

530
00:36:53,478 --> 00:36:54,790
Scott: Yeah, it's at this people.

531
00:36:55,131 --> 00:36:57,720
Scott: I think the people who worked on the show are in the.

532
00:36:58,101 --> 00:37:01,309
Scott: they often just put on like Sparta helmets and do stuff in the background.

533
00:37:02,531 --> 00:37:04,881
Scott: So it's like the closer is like you're looking forward to it.

534
00:37:04,941 --> 00:37:09,309
Scott: It's like oh, well, they can do for the closer this time It's like it's like exciting stuff.

535
00:37:10,542 --> 00:37:17,664
Rym: But yeah so the Greek guy just keeps going back and forth in time between 1964 Tokyo and ancient Greece and he does it a lot like.

536
00:37:17,724 --> 00:37:19,490
Scott: it's not like a special one-time thing.

537
00:37:19,551 --> 00:37:22,352
Scott: It's basically like he's just doing it constantly First.

538
00:37:22,392 --> 00:37:29,409
Rym: it happens mysteriously every episode but eventually the mayor's like get fucking back in there to that Tokiopolis whatever and figure some shit out for me.

539
00:37:30,313 --> 00:37:50,450
Scott: Yep, I just but it does draw, you know, it's like on the one hand It's so silly but on the other hand that they are drawing like these straight Comparisons of you know things happening in 60s Japan and things happening in ancient Greece to show you like yeah This thing from ancient Greece is happening in 60s Japan and is still happening today.

540
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:56,330
Scott: It's like, you know, you had a you know, the ancient pentathlon and now you have the modern pentathlon.

541
00:37:56,772 --> 00:38:01,170
Scott: This is where this is where modern pentathlon comes from and I'm like I knew about modern pentathlon already.

542
00:38:01,271 --> 00:38:02,910
Scott: But if I didn't this would be educational.

543
00:38:02,931 --> 00:38:12,089
Rym: Yeah well Especially because it makes a lot of like sort of side subtle points like there's this bit where he's designing new games and in ancient Greece they're stupid games because he's not good at this.

544
00:38:12,511 --> 00:38:14,922
Rym: So the mayor throws them all in the ocean in the future.

545
00:38:14,942 --> 00:38:21,720
Rym: all of those paintings He made had been found and historians were reading way too much into them.

546
00:38:22,791 --> 00:38:28,553
Rym: Mm-hmm There's also like it gets oddly maudlin a couple of times.

547
00:38:28,573 --> 00:38:38,050
Rym: Like what was I think was episode 9 where Randomly the old man just like yeah you want to come to the movies with me and then they watch movies about like World War 2 and war and

548
00:38:39,061 --> 00:38:42,914
Scott: Yeah, because the well because the ancient Greek guy right is that the story they tell?

549
00:38:43,034 --> 00:38:44,680
Scott: at least is that in ancient Greece?

550
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:48,073
Scott: Most of the wars were not very bloody like you would just say.

551
00:38:48,193 --> 00:38:51,206
Rym: there were a lot of ceremonial wars Depending on what era you're looking at.

552
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:56,500
Scott: Yeah, or at least not, you know, not that many people died They probably injured probably plenty, right?

553
00:38:57,281 --> 00:39:05,048
Rym: Not to say that there weren't any bloody wars, but the guy cut the mayor's like war is great when I win But it sucks when I lose.

554
00:39:05,269 --> 00:39:08,692
Rym: and then the war guy comes he's like, yeah I'm gonna loot a bunch of the rough.

555
00:39:08,934 --> 00:39:14,625
Scott: the main character Demetrius that really doesn't like conflict and war and fighting right at all Even if it's fake.

556
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:17,440
Scott: and he at one point it seems like a war.

557
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:30,640
Scott: He's have managed to avoid war somehow even with Spartans for so long with his, you know clever or somewhat not clever ways And eventually he the war looks like it's actually gonna happen for real and he super doesn't want it to happen.

558
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,917
Scott: He goes to Tokyo and he asks a guy in 60s Japan, right?

559
00:39:36,001 --> 00:39:38,208
Scott: You know, how do I stop war?

560
00:39:38,349 --> 00:39:41,620
Scott: and the guy takes him to the movie theater and shows him actual war movies.

561
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:46,300
Rym: So it's like the whole second half of that episode which so it's about two minutes of screen time.

562
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:47,305
Scott: Yeah, he's like.

563
00:39:47,325 --> 00:39:48,511
Scott: he's like, yeah, we lost a war.

564
00:39:48,551 --> 00:39:49,697
Scott: We haven't had a war since.

565
00:39:49,738 --> 00:39:51,105
Scott: he's like well When are you gonna have another one?

566
00:39:51,126 --> 00:39:53,399
Scott: He's like, we probably aren't gonna have another line.

567
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:56,240
Rym: He says is I don't think we'll go to war anymore.

568
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:04,408
Rym: and then it's just like the episode just gets maudlin and he like the guy sits through this movie on war and The old man just has one more thing.

569
00:40:04,428 --> 00:40:07,160
Rym: He's like not all of mankind's advancements are great.

570
00:40:09,005 --> 00:40:09,530
Scott: Yep, it's like friend.

571
00:40:09,571 --> 00:40:10,560
Scott: It's such a silly show.

572
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:22,073
Scott: They take the time out of their five-minute episode to do that And then and then I do the crazy closer, I think that one's about trip I on Yeah, and then the next episode he starts out immediately right.

573
00:40:22,494 --> 00:40:24,200
Scott: it picks up where it left off.

574
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,294
Scott: He's like, oh my god war is really bad.

575
00:40:26,354 --> 00:40:27,180
Scott: I can't let it happen.

576
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:27,421
Scott: I have.

577
00:40:27,441 --> 00:40:35,981
Scott: he's even more desperate to avoid the impending war in ancient Greece Because he's seen how bad war is in you know, 1940.

578
00:40:35,981 --> 00:40:39,820
Rym: So in terms of like how this show got made in the studio cuz I loved it.

579
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,607
Rym: Like this show is great.

580
00:40:40,668 --> 00:40:47,898
Rym: Like you're an anime fan this is the exact kind of weird crap to watch that you're not gonna see anywhere else like the stuff that we are.

581
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:51,673
Scott: so Lucky that someone is like crunchyroll.

582
00:40:51,734 --> 00:40:53,200
Scott: It's like how much money they make it on this.

583
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,718
Scott: But yeah, like the effort put in to subtitle and distribute this does that really help?

584
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:05,223
Rym: Like then a hundred people have even bothered to put a star on this show in crunchyroll Right.

585
00:41:05,264 --> 00:41:10,240
Scott: So the fact that this is even subtitled for consumption by anyone anywhere that you know.

586
00:41:10,542 --> 00:41:12,960
Scott: I wonder where like is it to watch this in Japan?

587
00:41:13,141 --> 00:41:15,380
Scott: Is it like on TV like a specific moment?

588
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:21,900
Scott: Like between two TV shows for five minutes like at midnight or something like who even knows where how it's broadcast there.

589
00:41:22,302 --> 00:41:25,620
Scott: But it's like, you know to put in the effort and to pay for this.

590
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:30,200
Scott: We are so lucky that someone has done this even even in fan sub days.

591
00:41:30,602 --> 00:41:34,418
Scott: What a fan summer have found this got and been able to get the video of it.

592
00:41:36,063 --> 00:41:40,600
Rym: It would have been like the rare tape that gets screened at an anime con at midnight.

593
00:41:40,721 --> 00:41:41,303
Rym: It is no.

594
00:41:41,343 --> 00:41:43,513
Scott: I like the one guy who knows right?

595
00:41:43,554 --> 00:41:44,619
Scott: No one would even know about it.

596
00:41:45,221 --> 00:41:46,707
Rym: Yep, so I tried what.

597
00:41:46,748 --> 00:41:49,660
Scott: there's probably so many shows like this that we don't know about.

598
00:41:49,901 --> 00:41:52,640
Rym: So I tried to figure out more about like where it came from.

599
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:58,760
Rym: So the direct like a lot of the people associated with this show don't even have their own pages on the anime news network.

600
00:41:59,321 --> 00:42:07,080
Rym: But the creator of the I guess the manga that this is based on or at least the creator of the story Mari Yamazaki.

601
00:42:07,801 --> 00:42:13,798
Rym: Mari Yamazaki actually is known for a few other things that we might have talked about like that Roman bath manga.

602
00:42:13,818 --> 00:42:15,666
Scott: Yeah There's a mom as a manga.

603
00:42:15,687 --> 00:42:16,853
Scott: I don't know if it was ever animated.

604
00:42:16,974 --> 00:42:17,940
Scott: thermae Romai.

605
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:18,986
Scott: I don't know how to remain Romai.

606
00:42:19,026 --> 00:42:25,173
Rym: not only it had a firm a Romai and had a manga a TV show and a live-action movie.

607
00:42:25,474 --> 00:42:27,260
Rym: and then I said that's in the live-action movie.

608
00:42:27,482 --> 00:42:29,419
Scott: I know about it, but I never actually watched it.

609
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:36,328
Scott: I think I read like a few pages of it in a bookstore once because the cover looks really awesome Right because it's the same style art round.

610
00:42:36,388 --> 00:42:38,034
Rym: It's kind of the same plot like a.

611
00:42:38,375 --> 00:42:39,540
Scott: it's kind of the same plot.

612
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,747
Scott: There's a Roman dude who has like.

613
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:44,756
Scott: there's a pathway in the Roman bathhouse that like takes them to.

614
00:42:44,776 --> 00:42:48,349
Scott: like, you know Japanese bathhouse is sort of like a connection.

615
00:42:48,369 --> 00:42:54,833
Scott: Yeah, and then he sort of brings, you know The Japanese bath stuff to Rome and this is sort of the same thing.

616
00:42:54,874 --> 00:43:02,108
Scott: You have a guy a great Greek guy connecting with Japan to write bring Sporting stuff to ancient Greece.

617
00:43:02,148 --> 00:43:08,333
Rym: So she also did the Steve Jobs manga Which hmm I knew existed.

618
00:43:08,715 --> 00:43:14,675
Scott: I think I knew it existed I think when I thought I was under the impression the Steve Jobs manga was a serious.

619
00:43:14,935 --> 00:43:16,480
Scott: it is straightforward biography.

620
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:19,571
Rym: It is based on Steve Jobs biography, but it's like a mom.

621
00:43:19,591 --> 00:43:20,534
Rym: Okay, so it's it of it.

622
00:43:20,614 --> 00:43:22,220
Scott: Oh, so it's not a ridiculous one.

623
00:43:22,361 --> 00:43:24,191
Rym: Nope, it's just straight as far as I can tell.

624
00:43:24,754 --> 00:43:33,795
Scott: It's not like, you know Teleporting to Japan to get ideas to put in an apple - or so I mean thermite Roma is also like pretty played pretty straight from what I've read of it.

625
00:43:34,759 --> 00:43:36,324
Scott: Oh, okay I thought it was ridiculous.

626
00:43:36,344 --> 00:43:39,213
Rym: Like this is I thought I think it's a lot less ridiculous than this.

627
00:43:39,514 --> 00:43:41,400
Rym: This is like maximum ridiculous.

628
00:43:41,923 --> 00:43:44,338
Scott: So I was slightly slightly questioning.

629
00:43:44,761 --> 00:43:48,200
Scott: There was an episode of this show that we're talking about today, right?

630
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:54,979
Scott: Where the closing song was about Nero the Roman Emperor How he how he cheated at the Olympics.

631
00:43:56,105 --> 00:43:57,070
Scott: So that was the tie-in.

632
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:58,638
Scott: but I'm like, hey, that's Rome not Greece.

633
00:43:58,658 --> 00:43:59,140
Scott: What are you doing?

634
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,808
Rym: Remember the Romans were obsessed with Greece and tried to like me.

635
00:44:01,829 --> 00:44:04,738
Scott: where I culture they were indeed like our.

636
00:44:04,819 --> 00:44:12,893
Rym: one anecdote I remember learning in high school was that Alexander the Great Wanted to participate in like some equivalent of the games.

637
00:44:12,933 --> 00:44:14,480
Rym: they wouldn't let him because he wasn't Greek enough.

638
00:44:14,721 --> 00:44:16,971
Rym: He had to prove that even though he was from Macedon.

639
00:44:17,212 --> 00:44:18,356
Rym: He had enough Greek heritage.

640
00:44:18,397 --> 00:44:19,180
Rym: There was like a whole thing.

641
00:44:20,102 --> 00:44:21,618
Scott: He'll prove it with a sword up your ass.

642
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:23,267
Scott: So him.

643
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:33,480
Rym: the anime studio Doesn't appear to have made any other anime Nobishiro lab, I couldn't find like any info about them.

644
00:44:33,861 --> 00:44:38,720
Rym: So I ended up going to their actual website which has like a demo reel and a few things.

645
00:44:39,626 --> 00:44:45,057
Rym: I don't know if the studio is just one, dude But the studio seems to be like a studio for hire type situation.

646
00:44:45,097 --> 00:44:46,965
Rym: that'll make Experiences and things.

647
00:44:47,427 --> 00:44:52,629
Rym: all I'm saying is if we ever want to make the GeekNights anime I kind of want to hire the studio to make it.

648
00:44:53,906 --> 00:44:54,434
Scott: That's all you.

649
00:44:56,581 --> 00:44:59,249
Scott: But seriously two guys get to a podcast.

650
00:44:59,329 --> 00:45:03,160
Scott: it gets teleported to the ancient days of Japanese radio to learn from.

651
00:45:04,586 --> 00:45:05,396
Rym: That would be great.

652
00:45:07,821 --> 00:45:11,632
Rym: Or in ancient Japanese why we keep saying ancient Japanese radio?

653
00:45:12,033 --> 00:45:14,419
Rym: someone doing old-timey radio is ancient.

654
00:45:15,323 --> 00:45:19,420
Rym: I mean ancient by what definition the 20s are my definition your definition.

655
00:45:20,205 --> 00:45:22,560
Rym: I guess kids today are like yeah, the 80s were an ancient time.

656
00:45:24,061 --> 00:45:26,188
Scott: People today like there's people a lot of people today.

657
00:45:26,228 --> 00:45:27,593
Scott: Just don't even listen to radio.

658
00:45:28,034 --> 00:45:28,435
Scott: It's true.

659
00:45:28,656 --> 00:45:29,800
Rym: Well that makes it archaic.

660
00:45:29,941 --> 00:45:31,412
Rym: It doesn't necessarily make it ancient.

661
00:45:32,078 --> 00:45:37,970
Rym: ancient anyway, I Don't see any reason.

662
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:44,320
Rym: if you're listening to GeekNights Anime because we don't review the kinds of anime that the other anime podcast tend to do usually.

663
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:46,934
Scott: We'll probably review the dega dance someday.

664
00:45:47,075 --> 00:45:54,400
Rym: Yeah, but If you listen to GeekNights for your anime reviews, this is a show you must watch.

665
00:45:55,361 --> 00:45:56,285
Scott: Yeah, this is a show.

666
00:45:56,506 --> 00:46:00,200
Rym: if you're here listening to this now Wednesdays are the least popular GeekNights night.

667
00:46:01,581 --> 00:46:04,813
Rym: We have a curated a particular audience of people who like a particular kind of show.

668
00:46:05,094 --> 00:46:07,424
Rym: just go watch the show right now It literally.

669
00:46:07,444 --> 00:46:10,740
Rym: it'll take you like an hour or two to watch everything and you're done.

670
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:13,691
Scott: They're five minute episodes and you skip the first 30 seconds.

671
00:46:13,851 --> 00:46:16,059
Scott: What's 20 times four and a half, right?

672
00:46:16,059 --> 00:46:20,345
Scott: 21 times 4.5 It'll take you 94 minutes.

673
00:46:20,385 --> 00:46:25,200
Scott: as long as it takes to watch one movie a short movie a normal length movie.

674
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:27,680
Scott: You can watch all 21 episodes of this on crunchy.

675
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:34,592
Rym: If we had discovered this show and we were running the RT anime club We would definitely have shown it immediately at the next meeting.

676
00:46:34,612 --> 00:46:36,980
Rym: We would have canceled whatever we had on the schedule.

677
00:46:37,363 --> 00:46:39,054
Scott: We would have shown the entire show.

678
00:46:39,074 --> 00:46:41,827
Rym: We would have shown Of course with the openers.

679
00:46:41,988 --> 00:46:45,160

Scott: it also.

683

Scott: I think it also, you know, especially not just with the Olympics but with The Greek ness living in a you know, predominantly Greek Neighborhood or at least a neighborhood that has a lot of you know, Greek stuff going on.

684
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:09,858
