00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,462
Rym: It's Monday March 15th 2021.

2
00:00:10,462 --> 00:00:14,929
Rym: I'm Rym Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:17,360
Rym: We are talking about cable management.

4
00:00:18,762 --> 00:00:19,798
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:21,081 --> 00:00:34,273
Rym: so uh today I actually did a a very in your late 30s adult char because I've worked at a lot of places and I've accumulated like I've rolled a lot of them over but not all of them.

6
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:37,372
Rym: just because I was lazy and it didn't matter that Retirement retirement.

7
00:00:37,413 --> 00:00:45,760
Rym: I've accumulated five Separate retirement accounts with five different entities that were at the first had money in them.

8
00:00:46,562 --> 00:00:48,429
Scott: The first two jobs I had.

9
00:00:48,971 --> 00:00:51,480
Scott: I didn't even realize I had such accounts.

10
00:00:51,641 --> 00:00:57,799
Scott: That was what happened with my first real job I when I quit even my cut even my co-op when I was at RIT.

11
00:00:58,061 --> 00:01:01,337
Scott: It wasn't a 401k they hit there was like a profit-sharing thing.

12
00:01:01,377 --> 00:01:04,169
Scott: I didn't even know It wasn't much money.

13
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,459
Rym: IBM didn't have anything like that.

14
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:11,166
Rym: third They had a little profit-sharing thing, but it was basically like I got 500 bucks when I left You know something along those.

15
00:01:11,207 --> 00:01:14,259
Scott: All right, but I never liked these paperwork just kept coming for it.

16
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,406
Scott: I was like what the hell is this?

17
00:01:15,486 --> 00:01:16,250
Scott: I finally figured out.

18
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:17,538
Scott: it was like oh, it's money I have.

19
00:01:17,638 --> 00:01:25,262
Rym: Okay So what you know what you want triggered me to do this was I got that paperwork again like for I had a 403.

20
00:01:25,262 --> 00:01:27,781
Scott: I don't get any paperwork anymore from anybody I don't.

21
00:01:27,801 --> 00:01:28,484
Rym: I don't accept.

22
00:01:28,504 --> 00:01:36,095
Rym: I had this 403b from Montefiore Medical Center back when I worked for the hospital and It's like a. it's like a magic 401k for nonprofits.

23
00:01:36,337 --> 00:01:36,799
Rym: It was pretty good.

24
00:01:37,881 --> 00:01:44,600
Rym: It had like almost no money in it because they didn't pay me shit But it was making its returns.

25
00:01:44,841 --> 00:01:49,063
Rym: But I ever like every month they'd send me a paper statement and the system was so out of date I couldn't get a digital.

26
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:49,766
Rym: so I was ignored it.

27
00:01:50,408 --> 00:01:52,856
Rym: and then recently it changed.

28
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:57,431
Rym: like a couple years ago I got paperwork that said oh, it's changing to a different company.

29
00:01:57,812 --> 00:02:00,180
Rym: And then I started getting paperwork from that different company.

30
00:02:00,857 --> 00:02:01,787
Scott: Yeah that happens occasionally.

31
00:02:01,827 --> 00:02:08,595
Rym: in the last month the Paperwork now said that it was coming changing to a third company and it moved to a third company.

32
00:02:08,634 --> 00:02:13,900
Rym: and this third company was finally One that had a website and a portal that worked and was modern.

33
00:02:14,985 --> 00:02:17,375
Rym: I logged in and immediately rolled it over into my betterment.

34
00:02:17,395 --> 00:02:26,500
Scott: It's just like yeah yeah, I just After it was so with a third job I had that paid real money not counting like, you know high school jobs.

35
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,980
Scott: Yeah, right They they had a real 401k that I contributed to and got matched and all the normal stuff.

36
00:02:32,522 --> 00:02:40,166
Scott: And then I so when I once I had that I rolled everything over and then every time I changed jobs After 90 days, I would always roll over.

37
00:02:40,247 --> 00:02:45,500
Scott: so I have all the money in one Place and when I got this job a few years ago, I rolled it over.

38
00:02:45,921 --> 00:02:48,732
Scott: I haven't had to do a big combo.

39
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:53,964
Scott: But the other thing is they've all been 401k rolloverable.

40
00:02:53,984 --> 00:02:56,673
Scott: I haven't had other like three B's or IRA.

41
00:02:56,713 --> 00:02:58,239
Rym: so I have a bunch of mine.

42
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:09,260
Rym: were That got like turned into IRAs because of nonsense didn't really matter Mmm, but basically I've never had to mix and match right?

43
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,916
Scott: It's always been the same kind directly rolling over at hundred percent of the money from the other.

44
00:03:13,936 --> 00:03:16,045
Rym: so I went there.

45
00:03:16,066 --> 00:03:23,000
Rym: I basically spent a while like Figuring out the account numbers for all these things and doing all the rollovers and it's at least it's easier now.

46
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,247
Scott: Every time I did it even just a few years ago.

47
00:03:25,367 --> 00:03:29,460
Scott: I had to like get the HR person at my company involved.

48
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,062
Scott: I couldn't just

49
00:03:30,122 --> 00:03:40,100
Rym: oh, you know hard the reason I didn't roll over that one from a pipeline so long ago because after I quit I thought okay, I'll deal with that like in a few more like after I get situated and then the company went under

50
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:41,823
Scott: And

51
00:03:42,763 --> 00:03:45,676
Rym: It was hard to like contact a person to deal with anything.

52
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:46,520
Rym: and that was back.

53
00:03:47,445 --> 00:03:49,538
Rym: All these investment firms had like portals that worked.

54
00:03:50,462 --> 00:03:51,265
Rym: Yeah, like.

55
00:03:51,286 --> 00:03:59,099
Rym: there was a time when like kind of like we did that ecommerce show where a lot of old ecommerce sites would be Like oh now that you've chosen the thing you want to buy here's how to mail us a check.

56
00:04:00,302 --> 00:04:06,984
Scott: Yeah, the other thing is I you know, the previous one in the current one We're both fidelity which made moving the money easier Whatever.

57
00:04:07,044 --> 00:04:11,658
Scott: but you know when I log into fidelity this two accounts listed there and the old one.

58
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,447
Scott: for some reason They didn't take all the money.

59
00:04:13,507 --> 00:04:14,131
Scott: It was like some.

60
00:04:14,191 --> 00:04:17,610
Scott: it was like 35 cents or something Like they didn't.

61
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:19,478
Scott: they didn't get a hundred percent of the money out of there.

62
00:04:20,221 --> 00:04:25,098
Scott: So we kept reporting on it and I was like eventually I called them and I was like look I got like 35 cents.

63
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:27,879
Scott: Can you just like do something about that?

64
00:04:28,982 --> 00:04:30,127
Rym: I got so actually.

65
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,439
Scott: so what they did is they changed it.

66
00:04:33,002 --> 00:04:33,931
Scott: So now it's a zero.

67
00:04:33,972 --> 00:04:34,557
Scott: it says zero.

68
00:04:34,598 --> 00:04:39,956
Scott: now I guess they just took the 35 cents and ran away with it or whatever, but I don't care

69
00:04:40,117 --> 00:04:52,448
Rym: you're when you're like 70 We're gonna be in the retirement home playing Pendragon and you're gonna open The equivalent of how letters get delivered in that distant future and it's gonna be like, yeah Here's the dollar 80 that you

70
00:04:52,649 --> 00:04:53,452
Scott: are earned.

71
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:55,440
Scott: But the point is the 35 cents is gone.

72
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:01,180
Scott: I don't know where it went But when I log in it still shows both accounts and it's like can you just get get rid of that one?

73
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,693
Scott: It's like it's it's done right?

74
00:05:02,714 --> 00:05:08,940
Rym: It's like close it You know, what sucks about working in enterprise software is that I know why a lot of times you just can't get rid of that.

75
00:05:10,581 --> 00:05:11,445
Rym: There's the same reason.

76
00:05:11,486 --> 00:05:14,480
Rym: my steam login still includes part of my social security number.

77
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,492
Scott: Yeah, anyway,

78
00:05:16,896 --> 00:05:26,118
Rym: yeah Anyway, but I actually that reminded me of a related thing where I had a bank account That I didn't think had any money in it that I forgot about

79
00:05:27,381 --> 00:05:27,903
Scott: Money that I

80
00:05:27,943 --> 00:05:33,263
Rym: haven't been to in forever and I eventually got a letter from the government That was one of those.

81
00:05:33,303 --> 00:05:40,842
Rym: Hey, the government has determined that you are the custodian of this unclaimed money Mm-hmm.

82
00:05:41,264 --> 00:05:41,545
Rym: There was.

83
00:05:42,127 --> 00:05:43,491
Rym: there was like 400 bucks in there.

84
00:05:44,394 --> 00:05:44,796
Scott: It happens.

85
00:05:44,836 --> 00:05:45,980
Rym: Yeah problem is back.

86
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,348
Rym: Well, I remember when I had that there is a in what.

87
00:05:48,388 --> 00:05:52,563
Rym: I could really use that money back when I had that account if I It was there.

88
00:05:53,506 --> 00:05:57,500
Scott: if you live in the United States, there's usually a website for your state.

89
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,746
Scott: I know New York has one.

90
00:05:58,806 --> 00:06:01,520
Scott: I think the comptroller runs the website.

91
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,674
Scott: I'm not sure but basically you type your info into this.

92
00:06:04,714 --> 00:06:09,399
Scott: totally legit not You know, make sure you find an actual legit one and not a fake one.

93
00:06:10,062 --> 00:06:19,740
Scott: but I know for sure that New York has a website where you type in your info and they find if there is Unclaimed money in New York that actually belongs to you.

94
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,020
Scott: It's like in this database, but you just you just can't get it unless you look it up.

95
00:06:23,121 --> 00:06:23,827
Scott: So it never hurts.

96
00:06:23,928 --> 00:06:26,931
Scott: there wasn't any money in there for me But it never hurts to go.

97
00:06:27,032 --> 00:06:28,119
Scott: everyone should go and take a look.

98
00:06:28,481 --> 00:06:42,555
Scott: You know if such a thing exists where you live and if you are in it Because there might be money that belongs to you that for some reason the government is just holding and waiting for you to come And claim yeah, it takes you what five minutes to check, you know, google it.

99
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,999
Scott: It's not not a joke at all I'm totally serious.

100
00:06:46,282 --> 00:06:57,106
Rym: so in some news One thing that has caused problems for technologists and humans for basically all of our adult lives And this has been around for a long time.

101
00:06:57,126 --> 00:07:00,337
Rym: Can you experience it this weekend daylight saving time?

102
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:08,640
Rym: Yep, there's no s on the end because remember I I was for many years a professional time nerd like my job.

103
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,527
Scott: I don't think the s matters that much.

104
00:07:10,547 --> 00:07:11,751
Rym: There's no fucking s there.

105
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:15,948
Rym: Don't say it with an s. It's not daylight savings time It's daylight saving time.

106
00:07:16,028 --> 00:07:18,600
Rym: as in we are going to save daylight during this time.

107
00:07:20,382 --> 00:07:24,390
Scott: Anyway, daylight savings time mean the same thing It's the time in which there is daylight.

108
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,980
Rym: save the time in which there are daylight savings.

109
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:26,402
Scott: There will be.

110
00:07:26,422 --> 00:07:28,999
Scott: there will be savings of daylight during this time.

111
00:07:30,301 --> 00:07:37,700
Rym: Yeah, but that's one not the text of the bill that caused it to come into being nor is it the actual name of the program.

112
00:07:38,543 --> 00:07:42,558
Scott: The point is that matters is that this is it sucks ass.

113
00:07:42,578 --> 00:07:42,940
Rym: is the point?

114
00:07:43,825 --> 00:07:46,520
Scott: This is closer to the correct position, right?

115
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:51,760
Scott: You know a lot of people are complaining about losing an hour or whatever and some people hate sunlight or complaining about sunlight.

116
00:07:51,881 --> 00:07:54,739
Rym: But the point is well the first half of those people the I do.

117
00:07:56,045 --> 00:07:56,872
Rym: Time is arbitrary.

118
00:07:57,034 --> 00:07:59,605
Rym: for the second job Pound sand.

119
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,169
Rym: we won and we're gonna win right.

120
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:15,920
Scott: the point is you want the clocks to stay Right in a position such that there is more daylight hours When you're not fucking working when the typical typical fucking sleeping is home and awake.

121
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:22,336
Rym: Exactly maximize the amount of time where the average person in America is home awake.

122
00:08:22,817 --> 00:08:23,800
Scott: I don't or anywhere.

123
00:08:24,081 --> 00:08:24,906
Scott: Yeah anywhere they live.

124
00:08:25,006 --> 00:08:27,420
Rym: Well, cuz most places just don't bother with anything like this at all.

125
00:08:28,681 --> 00:08:30,929
Rym: It's very much like an American and European thing.

126
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:33,378
Scott: The point is you're still choosing the hours, right?

127
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:37,220
Scott: You know when you know even regardless of where clocks are right?

128
00:08:37,341 --> 00:08:41,720
Scott: It's like, you know, you could live in like Island X. who knows what time zone it's in right?

129
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,863
Scott: Is your live on Island X?

130
00:08:43,245 --> 00:08:43,866
Scott: It's like okay.

131
00:08:44,248 --> 00:08:47,839
Scott: when at what time on the clock do people on Island X?

132
00:08:48,681 --> 00:08:49,124
Scott: Wake up.

133
00:08:49,285 --> 00:08:50,652
Scott: What time do they start working?

134
00:08:50,692 --> 00:08:52,200
Scott: What time do they stop working, right?

135
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,780
Scott: It's like it doesn't matter if you shift your clocks around, right?

136
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:10,759
Scott: It's the times, you know that you like you could have a whole country or a whole society where people wake up at Midnight, you know the equivalent of midnight when the earth is on the exact opposite side of the Sun isn't the exact opposite side of the earth, right?

137
00:09:12,621 --> 00:09:17,440
Scott: And then you could all just just you could just decide that and that's how people there operate.

138
00:09:17,601 --> 00:09:19,170
Rym: Yeah now daylight saving time.

139
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:33,220
Rym: I think we've talked about this like ignites a lot But basically it exists solely because of the combination of it made sense in an ancient agrarian American time Coupled with the fact that our government can't ever change anything.

140
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:36,087
Rym: Yep, except the clocks apparently.

141
00:09:36,628 --> 00:09:43,638
Rym: but and the thing is most known for for the last 40 years is Fucking up a bunch of IT stuff between two and four times a year.

142
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:47,779
Scott: Well, not I mean you've got you have your shit together now.

143
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:59,407
Scott: You would think that there are so many outages and weird problems around daylight saving time Around the world four times a year.

144
00:09:59,507 --> 00:09:59,949
Scott: I think it's.

145
00:10:00,089 --> 00:10:11,100
Scott: I think it's been you know close to like, you know, maybe 15 years since I've had a database that wasn't full of just everything in UTC and that's it.

146
00:10:11,783 --> 00:10:23,166
Rym: So honestly, it's not databases and like data quality issues It's usually like DevOps like real-time systems monitoring type stuff that messes up these days Mmm like that.

147
00:10:23,186 --> 00:10:23,829
Rym: That's what I see.

148
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:35,111
Rym: But anyway, there is Possibly literally the only thing that any American Republican in our government has ever supported in.

149
00:10:35,713 --> 00:10:37,117
Rym: that is actually a good idea.

150
00:10:37,538 --> 00:10:46,694
Rym: There is a bipartisan bill in the Senate Democrats and Republicans Trying to do exactly what Scott and I have always wanted.

151
00:10:46,754 --> 00:10:52,552
Rym: now that we've lost The hour in quotes and sprung forward into the correct time the better time.

152
00:10:52,572 --> 00:10:56,969
Rym: the bill says let's just fucking stay here Forever and never go back.

153
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:57,432
Rym: That's right.

154
00:10:57,834 --> 00:10:58,639
Scott: That's what we should do.

155
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:02,071
Scott: But also that bill I think has come up many many times.

156
00:11:02,111 --> 00:11:04,440
Scott: so it's not really news that it's up again.

157
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,250
Rym: Well, it's interesting that it's not like you could.

158
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,093
Scott: you could say you could.

159
00:11:08,154 --> 00:11:10,863
Scott: we could have said that same news for I think Probably every year.

160
00:11:11,164 --> 00:11:16,920
Rym: Well, what's interesting is it's not clear why this bill never actually passes.

161
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:20,652
Rym: No one disagrees with this except because it's not.

162
00:11:20,753 --> 00:11:30,008
Scott: it's not a high priority and If it actually came close to passing they'd start to report on it and people hate change So they'd get mad and sit goes sign style.

163
00:11:30,048 --> 00:11:33,780
Scott: So yeah, if you're a representative, it's like, you know, how hard do you want to?

164
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:39,997
Scott: Push on this, you know It's like just to start a big bunch of nonsense and it'll be a huge news.

165
00:11:40,058 --> 00:11:47,345
Scott: and more, you know When you're dealing with like something is actually important like, you know climate change or people dying Why would you waste your time on this?

166
00:11:47,626 --> 00:11:51,499
Scott: Yeah, you know, you just toss the paper out there and then it's like that's it.

167
00:11:51,821 --> 00:11:52,322
Rym: Yeah, there is.

168
00:11:52,342 --> 00:11:56,859
Rym: there is evidence though that it would actually improve public health for reasons that are probably too much for the show.

169
00:11:57,441 --> 00:11:59,147
Scott: There's a lot of things that are improved public health.

170
00:11:59,167 --> 00:12:02,519
Rym: Yeah, but this one costs us nothing and just makes the world a better place.

171
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:08,513
Scott: Government requires someone to do work to push something through and everyone's working on something more important.

172
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:10,198
Scott: Yeah or not working at all.

173
00:12:10,359 --> 00:12:10,519
Scott: Yeah.

174
00:12:11,502 --> 00:12:23,074
Rym: So, uh, we'll see if maybe for once this might be the last time this comes up because there has been increased interest in removing This as best I can tell the people who are most against changing it in America are.

175
00:12:23,094 --> 00:12:35,100
Scott: I hate to stereotype as old people But it seems like older voters are against it just because they're against stuff Right, but also I think I see a lot of people who are They want to make the standard time permanent because they hate the Sun.

176
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:40,259
Rym: Yeah, they want it to be dark earlier for like reasons that are in baffling and inscrutable to me.

177
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:44,287
Rym: Yeah a lot of it's People who get up early.

178
00:12:44,327 --> 00:12:48,363
Scott: if you meet anyone who's like let's make standard time permanent get your garlic I so I can.

179
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:55,023
Rym: I do know the per a person who is against doing what we wanted who wanted to just stay in regular time Forever standard time.

180
00:12:55,846 --> 00:13:00,160
Rym: their argument was that they get up early and punish all the people who don't also get up early.

181
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:03,030
Rym: Force people to get up earlier.

182
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:10,194
Scott: I Mean if I had the extent of the art if I was the boss of a company, you know And I didn't have to interact with other companies too much.

183
00:13:10,315 --> 00:13:11,783
Scott: I would just be like, yeah We're gonna set our.

184
00:13:11,823 --> 00:13:13,369
Scott: we don't care what the fucking clock say.

185
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:21,520
Scott: we we can start our work at any time We want right, you know and avoid commuting traffic, you know make everyone's life better.

186
00:13:22,262 --> 00:13:24,549
Scott: You could make dentist appointments without having to take off work.

187
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:25,773
Scott: Yeah kinds of good stuff.

188
00:13:25,933 --> 00:13:30,880
Rym: Anyway, so in some other news Twitter at a weird outage recently.

189
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,940
Rym: They had one outage only in Russia because the Russian government messed something up when they're trying to censor stuff.

190
00:13:35,422 --> 00:13:38,151
Rym: But they had an outage like yesterday.

191
00:13:38,171 --> 00:13:45,900
Rym: I think it happened on Sunday and like a little bit over the weekend Twitter accidentally started temporarily banning anyone who tweeted the word Memphis.

192
00:13:47,081 --> 00:13:47,563
Scott: It's true.

193
00:13:47,804 --> 00:14:03,520
Scott: They fixed it pretty quickly, but I assume this is some sort of you know Mistake some human error or some AI kind of error that must have detected some yeah You know pattern of bad tweets that had that word and then you know honed in on that word and started.

194
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,347
Scott: Maybe some bots were using that word a lot.

195
00:14:05,367 --> 00:14:05,748
Scott: Who knows?

196
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:06,110
Rym: Yeah.

197
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,880
Rym: Well, it looks it's interesting because smile mildly interesting.

198
00:14:09,162 --> 00:14:10,412
Rym: it seems like what's been happening.

199
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:23,880
Rym: because if you notice the Twitter lately has been grappling with the fact that people can pretty easily manipulate where specific words into appearing in the trending tweets and A lot of people have been manipulating that lately.

200
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:30,920
Rym: So I'm pretty sure Twitter tried to put in place some sort of anti gaming system on that but they made it generic.

201
00:14:31,342 --> 00:14:33,189
Rym: So it caught pretty much any.

202
00:14:33,209 --> 00:14:35,759
Rym: there's you know, the thing we always talk about there's literally.

203
00:14:35,819 --> 00:14:36,887
Scott: no There's not gonna.

204
00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:38,479
Scott: Twitter's not gonna explain it to us.

205
00:14:38,741 --> 00:14:44,480
Rym: It's like, you know, but there's literally no difference between a lot of people being interested something in something and a DOS.

206
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:45,871
Rym: They're the same thing.

207
00:14:46,657 --> 00:14:46,979
Scott: Of course.

208
00:14:47,686 --> 00:15:04,339
Rym: so I Feel like the real story here is that Twitter keeps trying to do these kinds of changes to clamp down on behavior that Embarrasses them or goes against their monetization instead of applying it toward the thing They should apply it toward which is harassment racism, etc.

209
00:15:05,647 --> 00:15:07,866
Scott: Yeah, of course What else is new?

210
00:15:08,087 --> 00:15:08,308
Rym: Yep.

211
00:15:08,711 --> 00:15:10,039
Rym: So you got any other tech news?

212
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:11,839
Scott: Yes, here's the news.

213
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:14,279
Scott: This is a little bit old like last month or so.

214
00:15:15,183 --> 00:15:15,343
Scott: It's.

215
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:19,176
Scott: it's not really about this particular incident because who gives a crap about that?

216
00:15:19,296 --> 00:15:21,844
Scott: it's about the broader Concept right?

217
00:15:21,924 --> 00:15:27,700
Scott: is that somebody made a browser extension an add-on right for Chrome Firefox, whatever.

218
00:15:28,464 --> 00:15:39,427
Scott: And when you have a browser add-on And Firefox at least usually these things nowadays are used to be that they would just have you know Full control of your browser basically.

219
00:15:39,447 --> 00:15:41,133
Scott: Yeah nowadays they'll at.

220
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:46,680
Scott: you'll have to grant the the Permission to your add-ons to do specific things, right?

221
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:51,680
Scott: But if you want to like your ad blocker you have to give it a shit ton of permissions to actually block ads.

222
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,067
Scott: You don't really have a choice there.

223
00:15:53,247 --> 00:15:53,388
Rym: Yep.

224
00:15:53,448 --> 00:16:00,389
Rym: It's got to be able to see the contents of the page exactly, so when you Like live your whole life in this browser.

225
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:11,738
Scott: if you know the add-ons that you choose to you know The browser software itself you have to trust But you have to trust the add-ons you add to the browser written by some who knows who on.

226
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:13,063
Scott: you know Whatever.

227
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,170
Scott: you just take some code put it in your browser.

228
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:19,696
Scott: Yeah, if that code is anything untrustworthy in it Like it could just ruin you.

229
00:16:21,641 --> 00:16:22,905
Scott: You know, it's.

230
00:16:22,965 --> 00:16:28,600
Scott: there's only so many protections that the browser has to limit the power of like any add-ons whatsoever.

231
00:16:29,602 --> 00:16:31,640
Scott: You can like look at the web pages your you know.

232
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,780
Scott: You go to bank calm and it can just look and see how much your money.

233
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:45,213
Rym: Also web browsers are a high-value target for all the reasons Scott just described like if you cover If you can control someone's web browser you can have it do things.

234
00:16:45,253 --> 00:16:48,062
Scott: you can have it make web requests and do all kinds of Net stuff.

235
00:16:48,102 --> 00:16:51,176
Scott: and you know, you're just like running JavaScript on someone's computer.

236
00:16:51,417 --> 00:16:54,951
Scott: It's like thanks Use your computer to run JavaScript.

237
00:16:54,971 --> 00:16:57,079
Scott: mine coins do whatever bullshit, right?

238
00:16:58,821 --> 00:17:05,232
Scott: So what happened was is there was an extension that was popular And it was perfectly good.

239
00:17:05,271 --> 00:17:06,157
Scott: There's nothing wrong with it.

240
00:17:07,681 --> 00:17:12,056
Scott: But then the person who made that extension just like sold it to someone else.

241
00:17:12,337 --> 00:17:20,280
Rym: that's happened and Multiple times like you might block you block got to change hands at right and that's why we use you block origin now.

242
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,960
Scott: Don't use regular you block anyway.

243
00:17:22,782 --> 00:17:26,960
Scott: But yeah, that's they sold it to someone else and the someone else just put in some malware's.

244
00:17:28,741 --> 00:17:30,466
Scott: And that's that it's like.

245
00:17:31,209 --> 00:17:34,799
Scott: and it's like a lot of times people trust something just cuz it's on like github.

246
00:17:35,301 --> 00:17:37,111
Scott: It's like ah, it's open source on github.

247
00:17:37,131 --> 00:17:37,493
Scott: Therefore.

248
00:17:37,553 --> 00:17:38,779
Scott: Someone must have looked at ya.

249
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,816
Rym: I remember the old days people would be like, oh go to SourceForge and get the thing.

250
00:17:41,837 --> 00:17:44,327
Rym: It's like, okay This is something dot exe.

251
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:47,540
Rym: just because it happens to be on SourceForge does not mean it.

252
00:17:48,803 --> 00:17:52,392
Scott: Mozilla and I think Chrome in their add-on stores.

253
00:17:52,552 --> 00:17:58,364
Scott: They do have programs where some of the add-ons are Validated like they like.

254
00:17:58,605 --> 00:18:07,200
Scott: they went and they checked and they said like Firefox will go Mozilla will go and say yeah We looked at this add-on and it's legit we you can trust it.

255
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:15,495
Scott: At least if you trust Mozilla then you can trust this add-on and other ones are labeled as like someone uploaded this And we didn't look at it.

256
00:18:15,555 --> 00:18:17,851
Scott: We're just Redistributing it on the add-on store.

257
00:18:17,871 --> 00:18:20,866
Scott: because that's you know, whatever I think a lot of if it's.

258
00:18:21,046 --> 00:18:24,720
Scott: if it's a shady add-on, please click this report button so we can block it.

259
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:37,348
Rym: Right, but in the meantime You know Well two things all your own risk most Malware will not let on that you're infected with malware so you won't know to report anything.

260
00:18:37,368 --> 00:18:45,271
Rym: and To a lot of people seem to think that oh, it's open source Like it's on some sort of repo and it's open source.

261
00:18:45,693 --> 00:18:47,580
Rym: Someone would have noticed if it was malware.

262
00:18:48,162 --> 00:18:48,564
Rym: Guess what?

263
00:18:48,624 --> 00:18:57,075
Rym: Not many people spend their time going through like chrome tab Suspender extensions to look at the source code and see if anything he's going.

264
00:18:57,115 --> 00:18:58,500
Scott: you go to install an extension.

265
00:18:58,622 --> 00:18:59,700
Scott: You see it's open source.

266
00:19:00,142 --> 00:19:00,424
Scott: It's like.

267
00:19:00,524 --> 00:19:03,560
Scott: are you gonna put through the effort or do you have the ability to look at it?

268
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,274
Scott: Investigate it and determine whether it's malware or not.

269
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:07,260
Rym: Yeah, I can read code.

270
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,532
Scott: Why do you assume that anyone has done that even one time?

271
00:19:12,592 --> 00:19:14,620
Scott: if you're not willing to do it that one time yeah.

272
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:20,499
Rym: So I trust this extension because a bunch of my friends use it.

273
00:19:21,062 --> 00:19:23,390
Rym: They must be smart and they all trust it cuz they know people.

274
00:19:23,691 --> 00:19:28,568
Rym: but at no point did anyone actually look and see that it's Forwarding all your traffic to some dodgy IP address in Russia.

275
00:19:28,809 --> 00:19:28,969
Scott: Yep.

276
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:34,579
Scott: If anyone wants to do a good deed pick one of your extensions That's a less popular one, right?

277
00:19:35,501 --> 00:19:36,806
Scott: you know something like you block origin.

278
00:19:36,826 --> 00:19:47,238
Scott: you probably don't have to do this right, but find another one that you use and maybe Read the code of it and make sure it's legit and then let everyone know if it's trustworthy or report it if it's not.

279
00:19:47,378 --> 00:19:52,600
Scott: and but Yeah, just be aware of Which add-ons you have in your browsers?

280
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:54,945
Scott: That's the news there.

281
00:19:55,046 --> 00:19:57,340
Scott: Okay other news tiny news, right?

282
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:01,960
Scott: We all know that companies all have these little home pod things.

283
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,268
Scott: I guess Apple is the only one that's actually called a home pod.

284
00:20:04,308 --> 00:20:06,938
Scott: the Amazon ones like Alexa and the.

285
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:12,500
Rym: I don't know What's up with the Google cuz Google changed its branding around this stuff a bunch of times and I don't know anymore.

286
00:20:12,701 --> 00:20:14,551
Scott: The Amazon one seems to be the winning one.

287
00:20:14,571 --> 00:20:18,046
Scott: Yeah, I mean not that I would get one But I'm just saying like it's it's.

288
00:20:18,247 --> 00:20:24,720
Rym: I have an old drop cam and I think that like moved into the Google ecosystem But it just won't work anymore and I didn't bother to try to figure it out.

289
00:20:25,701 --> 00:20:27,044
Scott: Point is these things?

290
00:20:27,064 --> 00:20:27,666
Scott: I'm not.

291
00:20:27,686 --> 00:20:44,839
Scott: I was really surprised that they became popular because I feel like if you've got a big house in the suburbs One little speaker right is like, okay Maybe you put it in the living room or the kitchen like this main area of the house But it's like don't you kind of want to cover the whole house with it?

292
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,667
Scott: It's like you have to get more of them.

293
00:20:47,189 --> 00:20:49,660
Scott: It doesn't seem too useful if it's not everywhere, right?

294
00:20:50,941 --> 00:20:54,740
Scott: And also if you've got that much room, you've got room for like an actual sound system.

295
00:20:54,820 --> 00:21:00,518
Scott: Why do you want to have sound coming in this one little guy, even though there are pretty impressive for being one little guy I mean that little.

296
00:21:01,273 --> 00:21:01,379
Rym: Good.

297
00:21:02,981 --> 00:21:03,664
Scott: Yeah, I mean, they're not.

298
00:21:03,684 --> 00:21:06,235
Scott: they're pretty impressive for being one little guy, but it's still.

299
00:21:06,275 --> 00:21:07,380
Scott: it's like even in my house.

300
00:21:07,441 --> 00:21:11,107
Scott: I have two Like sound systems with speakers in this little.

301
00:21:11,148 --> 00:21:19,880
Rym: so my grandparents they had a pretty like swinger house that they built themselves And the house was wired with a really fancy intercom system.

302
00:21:19,961 --> 00:21:32,075
Rym: so basically every room had stereo speakers in it and you could use the intercoms like ping other rooms and talk to people and there was a central system that Could connect the whole thing up to the radio the hi-fi system or the CB radio.

303
00:21:32,095 --> 00:21:33,299
Rym: that was integrated into the house.

304
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,297
Scott: Yep I've seen those.

305
00:21:35,303 --> 00:21:40,179
Scott: But anyway, the point is that Apple they came out with their home pod mini like their last.

306
00:21:40,904 --> 00:21:43,239
Scott: Was it one or two keynotes ago late last year?

307
00:21:43,842 --> 00:21:51,480
Scott: They're basically just like the home pod mini was interesting because usually you have like iPod iPod nano Right and the smaller one is better in a lot of ways.

308
00:21:51,982 --> 00:21:53,467
Scott: But it's also worse in some ways.

309
00:21:53,507 --> 00:21:57,160
Scott: right the iPod nano did not have the storage or the battery life of the big iPod.

310
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:57,945
Scott: Yeah, it was.

311
00:21:57,965 --> 00:21:59,899
Scott: it was lesser in some ways.

312
00:22:01,182 --> 00:22:04,679
Scott: The home pod mini definitely seemed to me when they announced it.

313
00:22:04,941 --> 00:22:07,394
Scott: Like isn't it just better than the home pod in every way?

314
00:22:07,454 --> 00:22:08,379
Scott: like in what way?

315
00:22:09,342 --> 00:22:10,711
Rym: So reading is a regular home.

316
00:22:11,154 --> 00:22:16,556
Rym: the home pod mini cost $99 a third the price of the home pod and offers notably lower sound quality.

317
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:21,114
Rym: Oh Okay speakers physically smaller speakers are just worse.

318
00:22:21,134 --> 00:22:21,375
Rym: It's true.

319
00:22:21,395 --> 00:22:22,420
Rym: We'll stop that's true.

320
00:22:22,761 --> 00:22:27,989
Scott: But in terms of any other kind of features besides the sound quality, I guess It was just worse.

321
00:22:28,412 --> 00:22:28,978
Scott: I mean just better.

322
00:22:30,581 --> 00:22:34,680
Scott: So they've just canceled the regular home pod and it's like yeah, no one bought those things to begin with.

323
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,459
Scott: I don't think anyone bought the mini one either.

324
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:44,110
Scott: I guess maybe a rich person would put these in like Sense, I feel like someone who's rich enough.

325
00:22:44,391 --> 00:22:47,380
Rym: They're getting a bespoke system like integrated into the house.

326
00:22:47,922 --> 00:22:49,387
Scott: Yeah, it's like I really like.

327
00:22:49,608 --> 00:22:50,471
Scott: these are popular.

328
00:22:50,512 --> 00:23:01,458
Scott: people have them but it's like like yeah if I was you maybe if you're a person with a one-room or two-room apartment and you don't care about sound quality and you're You're not really.

329
00:23:01,641 --> 00:23:13,240
Scott: You know I wanted to just works Listening person and you actually talk to Siri or Alexa or whoever out loud Yeah for doing whatever it is that you do with that then maybe that's for you.

330
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:28,560
Scott: But like I never understood who the hell these are for who wants these it seemed like it's something companies wanted to sell right and in the same way that You know SUVs or something car companies wanted to sell and they made people want them, right?

331
00:23:28,941 --> 00:23:34,440
Scott: So the companies I think have done and you know, they've done a clearly an amazing job of making people want SUVs.

332
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:41,542
Scott: I think they've done an okay job of making people want these But there's only so much you can do Right in.

333
00:23:41,582 --> 00:23:45,816
Rym: that's a fascinating because my whole career because I'm a product manager like that kind of decision.

334
00:23:45,836 --> 00:23:54,285
Rym: I Have always focused on what is a problem that I can solve for people out there where they would be willing to pay me for That solution.

335
00:23:54,305 --> 00:24:00,270
Rym: I have never in my life Actually tried to say I have a thing that's easy to make.

336
00:24:00,531 --> 00:24:03,300
Rym: I want to get people to buy this thing like that.

337
00:24:03,662 --> 00:24:04,649
Rym: I've never tried that.

338
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:08,006
Rym: I've never even like gone down that path Mm-hmm.

339
00:24:09,062 --> 00:24:11,692
Scott: But yeah, the point is I don't know who these are for.

340
00:24:11,772 --> 00:24:13,037
Scott: It's not unsurprising to me.

341
00:24:13,057 --> 00:24:19,220
Rym: Yeah I was really rich like stupid rich and I wanted like a sound system in my giant sprawling house.

342
00:24:19,762 --> 00:24:28,339
Rym: I would have fancy speakers mounted into like the ceilings of every room Wired to a central system that is generic and can take literally any input in.

343
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:34,040
Scott: Right, but like I just don't know who you know, you're we're only thinking you're only thing about like the stereo feature, right?

344
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,077
Scott: He's have the that you talk to it, right?

345
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,479
Rym: Well the all the other aspects of it.

346
00:24:38,802 --> 00:24:50,399
Rym: I see the place people seem to put these the most in my Experiences like pre kovid when I'd like be in someone's apartment or house is they always put them in the kitchen And they use them while they're like hooking and doing kitchen these stuff.

347
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:53,272
Scott: Yeah, you can use it for a timer but you can just.

348
00:24:53,372 --> 00:24:55,240
Scott: I see a lot of people use Siri for a timer.

349
00:24:55,402 --> 00:24:56,997
Scott: They just use their phone or their watch.

350
00:24:57,037 --> 00:25:00,959
Scott: Yeah Yeah, if you have a home pod you have an iPhone I watch.

351
00:25:01,581 --> 00:25:02,183
Scott: Maybe right.

352
00:25:02,203 --> 00:25:03,186
Scott: I'll definitely have an iPhone.

353
00:25:03,226 --> 00:25:05,272
Rym: No question if they were smart enough to.

354
00:25:05,593 --> 00:25:07,920
Rym: so why do you need real-time respond to me?

355
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:11,472
Rym: With more advanced queries like Siri, how how long should I cook?

356
00:25:11,632 --> 00:25:15,706
Scott: but that the same Siri that's on the home Pod is in the iPad and the iPhone.

357
00:25:15,746 --> 00:25:16,629
Scott: It's the same Siri.

358
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:17,974
Scott: Why wait from camera.

359
00:25:18,335 --> 00:25:19,640
Scott: It's like what's the home pod for?

360
00:25:19,881 --> 00:25:22,758
Rym: Well, cuz my phone won't listen to me unless I touch it and turn it on.

361
00:25:22,778 --> 00:25:25,187
Rym: I Have to keep turning it.

362
00:25:25,268 --> 00:25:26,355
Scott: You can make it not do that.

363
00:25:26,556 --> 00:25:26,737
Scott: You can.

364
00:25:26,757 --> 00:25:27,160
Scott: I don't want it.

365
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,980
Scott: I don't want it to listen when I'm walking this thing.

366
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:35,767
Rym: That's what this thing does and it can't play loud music by itself while I'm cooking and there's a bunch of banging going on in the kitchen.

367
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,834
Scott: That's because you've never had an Apple phone or Apple iPad even even then.

368
00:25:40,915 --> 00:25:42,180
Rym: and I find surprising.

369
00:25:43,221 --> 00:25:44,813
Rym: Audio, well that event fan is going.

370
00:25:44,833 --> 00:25:45,720
Rym: compared to one of these things.

371
00:25:45,981 --> 00:25:47,446
Rym: There's no subwoofer in your eyes.

372
00:25:47,867 --> 00:25:54,539
Scott: if the vent fan is going even my real stereo with with 5.1 sound it needs to be cranked to a dangerous level.

373
00:25:56,063 --> 00:25:58,339
Scott: So I don't I just turn off audio when the fan is on.

374
00:25:59,283 --> 00:26:04,544
Rym: So in some other news, this is a tariff like this article.

375
00:26:04,564 --> 00:26:13,559
Rym: the thing that happened is terrifying to me and It honestly like I already like LG has not really been on my doesn't doesn't terrify me.

376
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:17,034
Rym: It doesn't terrify me in the sense that I'm not vulnerable to this.

377
00:26:17,074 --> 00:26:18,079
Rym: I would never buy an LG TV.

378
00:26:19,221 --> 00:26:23,354
Scott: Of course not or an LG monitor or an LG anything, but I got an LG monitor.

379
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:23,816
Scott: It's fine.

380
00:26:23,876 --> 00:26:24,819
Scott: It doesn't have ads on it.

381
00:26:25,302 --> 00:26:29,129
Rym: Yeah, I Think it's gonna be fine one day one day.

382
00:26:29,149 --> 00:26:31,638
Scott: I think it's not connected to the internet.

383
00:26:31,699 --> 00:26:31,980
Scott: It's good.

384
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,974
Rym: Well, this one wasn't connected to the internet either.

385
00:26:34,035 --> 00:26:34,720
Rym: That's the problem.

386
00:26:35,701 --> 00:26:36,878
Scott: Well, yes and no.

387
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:37,400
Rym: Yeah.

388
00:26:37,701 --> 00:26:39,186
Rym: so basically the the.

389
00:26:39,327 --> 00:26:47,620
Rym: you can read the article to see the details because this kind of thing is Happening in the low end of the TV market and has for some time.

390
00:26:48,041 --> 00:26:49,407
Rym: This is a trend in all industries.

391
00:26:49,447 --> 00:26:52,379
Rym: same thing happened with like I don't know e-readers.

392
00:26:52,459 --> 00:26:56,515
Rym: cheap e-readers would like show ads on their home screen that you couldn't turn off like.

393
00:26:56,535 --> 00:26:57,178
Rym: that was the thing.

394
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:57,419
Rym: Mm-hmm.

395
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:05,039
Rym: But the margins on TVs are pretty low and it turns out most consumers unless you're rich and buying like an upper high-end thing.

396
00:27:05,661 --> 00:27:07,829
Scott: Price only rich P only rich people.

397
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:13,980
Scott: and you know tech people who know about tech and snobs Actually care about things like contrast ratio, right?

398
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:20,920
Scott: most people just say I Want to I got a flat TV and I get the biggest one I can afford or the fits on my wall or whatever.

399
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,184
Rym: And how big is it?

400
00:27:22,204 --> 00:27:23,830
Rym: How many dollars is it?

401
00:27:23,931 --> 00:27:24,312
Rym: That's it.

402
00:27:24,513 --> 00:27:26,400
Scott: Yeah, then they don't give a shit about anything else.

403
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:30,220
Scott: It's only you know people who care of like oh, how's the color reproduction?

404
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:34,055
Scott: Those the only people care about what anything else.

405
00:27:34,256 --> 00:27:38,134
Scott: so I know it's funny Best buy and buying a TV off the rack.

406
00:27:38,396 --> 00:27:39,060
Rym: I got some training.

407
00:27:40,521 --> 00:27:50,010
Rym: I'm like setting price points and like market research on prices like pricing as a topic and It basically the the thing that came up.

408
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:50,532
Rym: in the training.

409
00:27:50,552 --> 00:27:53,120
Rym: we were talking about how people actually make decisions based on data.

410
00:27:53,782 --> 00:28:04,708
Rym: The fascinating part was people like you and me who actually care at all about the specifications of any ultra rare Significant insignificant you might even pay attention to.

411
00:28:04,728 --> 00:28:08,760
Rym: the advice is just pretend those people don't exist or cater exclusively to them.

412
00:28:09,902 --> 00:28:10,485
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

413
00:28:10,686 --> 00:28:10,888
Scott: Yep.

414
00:28:11,813 --> 00:28:13,160
Rym: We don't exist in the market.

415
00:28:14,321 --> 00:28:15,847
Rym: Same reason why I like shitty.

416
00:28:15,908 --> 00:28:25,345
Rym: airlines are all shitty in the same ways because the only decision that matters is the number of dollars for the ticket at the time you buy the ticket, so The problem is

417
00:28:25,847 --> 00:28:27,131
Scott: because of

418
00:28:27,191 --> 00:28:36,740
Rym: that and because of market pressures and margins and everything This kind of thing is now rising higher and higher into the stack into like the middle of the road options.

419
00:28:38,005 --> 00:28:46,141
Rym: Basically Fancy o LED TVs not just the bottom of the barrel ones, but like an actual LED TV from LG Has.

420
00:28:46,382 --> 00:28:52,119
Rym: they have embedded ads that will play in the menus built into the TV?

421
00:28:53,521 --> 00:28:53,702
Scott: Right.

422
00:28:53,722 --> 00:28:55,852
Scott: Well, it's in the smart TV portion, right?

423
00:28:55,892 --> 00:29:00,458
Scott: So if you're not using the smart It's not like it's gonna go on top of like a movie or watch.

424
00:29:00,478 --> 00:29:08,181
Scott: Yeah But when you open up the menus to do smart TV shut shit like use the Netflix app built into the TV Right.

425
00:29:08,222 --> 00:29:09,366
Scott: Yeah, press the menu button.

426
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:12,839
Scott: this menu comes up and it shows you all these apps built into the TV.

427
00:29:13,421 --> 00:29:18,980
Scott: You know Netflix Apple TV plus HBO max or whatever and you're going to choose one.

428
00:29:19,421 --> 00:29:22,331
Scott: Well, there's a whole area on the screen for them to show ads.

429
00:29:22,371 --> 00:29:23,154
Scott: the L because it's the.

430
00:29:23,174 --> 00:29:24,619
Scott: you're in the LG OS.

431
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:30,072
Scott: to some It's usually Android powered most of the time Although I've heard that at least one of them is like still web OS.

432
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:32,822
Scott: it doesn't matter what OS they're using Right is this?

433
00:29:33,263 --> 00:29:43,709
Scott: there's a little computer about as powerful as a phone a shitty phone built into the TV that's doing this stuff and This is why I never get a smart TV, right?

434
00:29:43,869 --> 00:29:46,959
Scott: Yeah, TV should be a monitor only it should do nothing.

435
00:29:47,301 --> 00:29:47,907
Rym: It's all it is.

436
00:29:47,927 --> 00:29:51,285
Scott: That really does a Video signal I send into it does.

437
00:29:51,306 --> 00:30:01,115
Scott: there are still companies making monitors and there actually is a trend lately of monitor companies Making very large monitors.

438
00:30:01,135 --> 00:30:06,274
Scott: Yeah, right They're selling them as monitors like by this 55 inch gaming monitor.

439
00:30:06,354 --> 00:30:08,140
Scott: and it's like that's a television.

440
00:30:08,362 --> 00:30:09,779
Scott: Yeah, but look at it like that.

441
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:15,020
Rym: But it is called going after the Rym and Scott and for other people demographic right there.

442
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,540
Scott: But it's like Alienware has like a 55 inch or I think or something like that.

443
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,100
Scott: But the point is it doesn't have smart TV bullshit in it as a monitor.

444
00:30:22,341 --> 00:30:27,777
Rym: So where this ad cropped up was when this person went into the TV to update some stuff.

445
00:30:27,837 --> 00:30:28,840
Rym: the ad just played.

446
00:30:29,001 --> 00:30:30,151
Rym: There's no way to turn it off.

447
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:31,241
Rym: And this is a $1,400 TV.

448
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:42,040
Scott: Yeah, I mean don't use I. this is the advice We've always said and will continue to say do not buy a smart TV if you have no choice.

449
00:30:42,181 --> 00:30:43,616
Scott: But to buy a smart TV.

450
00:30:44,562 --> 00:30:47,272
Scott: Do not use any of the smart things in the TV.

451
00:30:47,332 --> 00:30:48,778
Rym: never let it connect to the internet.

452
00:30:48,858 --> 00:30:51,630
Scott: even never Connect the TV directly to the internet.

453
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:53,439
Scott: disable the Wi-Fi in the TV.

454
00:30:54,162 --> 00:30:55,969
Scott: Do not let it connect to your Wi-Fi.

455
00:30:56,029 --> 00:30:58,720
Scott: do not put an ethernet cable into the TV, right?

456
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:02,119
Scott: Do not let it touch your home network in any way shape or form.

457
00:31:02,721 --> 00:31:16,458
Scott: only use the TV for it's you know, not smart functionality of other devices sending video signals to it probably with HDMI because it's 2021 and you know plug your switch into it.

458
00:31:16,578 --> 00:31:23,640
Scott: plug your HTPC into it and if you really aren't gonna have an HTPC and you got a Roku or an Apple TV or something use those.

459
00:31:23,801 --> 00:31:27,279
Scott: Those are more trustworthy than the shit that's in the TV.

460
00:31:27,501 --> 00:31:27,621
Scott: Right?

461
00:31:27,641 --> 00:31:31,219
Scott: an Apple TV is 10,000 times better as much as it's not good.

462
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:38,283
Scott: Yeah, then whatever is in any TV, even the best TV in the world use that instead And that's it.

463
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:39,847
Rym: Yep, and just we need to agree.

464
00:31:40,188 --> 00:31:48,960
Rym: like this kind of like a non-consensual Advertising creeping a higher and higher higher into the stack needs to be nipped in the bud because this is all they're gonna.

465
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,074
Scott: It's not just it's not even just advertising right?

466
00:31:52,155 --> 00:31:59,238
Scott: It's it's you know, all the other The Internet of shit coupled with the non.

467
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:14,058
Rym: HTPCs tend to not have the full functionality of a web browser going to the site where the content is and Have their own ulterior motives for monetization and often their own algorithms to drive What kind of content get gets pushed at you?

468
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:15,321
Scott: That's.

469
00:32:15,341 --> 00:32:17,571
Scott: the other thing is that you know, you'd be just.

470
00:32:17,692 --> 00:32:20,485
Scott: it's just tons and tons of reasons We've talked about in the past.

471
00:32:20,585 --> 00:32:26,270
Scott: but do not if you can at all, right which you probably can Do not you get smart TV?

472
00:32:26,371 --> 00:32:29,363
Scott: And if you have a smart TV don't use the smart parts Yep at all.

473
00:32:29,543 --> 00:32:39,639
Rym: ever under any circumstance and since LG is breaking ground in putting these ads How pretty high up in the stack my advice is never buy an LG device again, at least not a TV.

474
00:32:40,901 --> 00:32:47,640
Scott: Yeah, I would not buy, you know, if a company has a TV that has ads in it I'm not going to buy a TV for that company.

475
00:32:47,640 --> 00:33:04,271
Rym: Yeah I would like really I would like to see legislation to make it difficult or impossible to embed ads in devices directly like this like there should be some sort of regulation around this because really What this is gonna turn into have a really good regulation.

476
00:33:04,312 --> 00:33:09,180
Rym: people and very technologically savvy People can avoid this shit and everyone else is stuck with it.

477
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:12,690
Scott: I have a really easy regulation, you know, because it's already been.

478
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:23,777
Scott: you know, I'm not a lawyer or a constitutional scholar or anything But I am aware Correct me if I'm wrong the while speech is very strongly protected.

479
00:33:23,838 --> 00:33:25,768
Scott: United States Commercial speech is not.

480
00:33:25,909 --> 00:33:27,780
Scott: it is illegal to have cigarette ads on TV.

481
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:31,679
Scott: Yeah, it used to be illegal to not have prescription drug ads on TV.

482
00:33:33,102 --> 00:33:36,700
Scott: You know, you can't even have cigarette ad billboards or magazines anymore, right?

483
00:33:37,822 --> 00:33:39,833
Rym: They're like banned like Congress.

484
00:33:39,873 --> 00:33:40,496
Rym: kind of ad.

485
00:33:40,737 --> 00:33:41,180
Rym: full stop.

486
00:33:41,761 --> 00:33:46,452
Scott: Congress has the power to write regulate commercial speech.

487
00:33:46,753 --> 00:33:48,237
Scott: full stop you could.

488
00:33:48,257 --> 00:33:51,304
Scott: they could write a law that says Advertising is illegal.

489
00:33:51,806 --> 00:33:55,480
Scott: any company that advertises the CEO goes to prison for their life.

490
00:33:55,681 --> 00:33:56,525
Scott: That's the whole law.

491
00:33:56,726 --> 00:33:57,792
Scott: the end vote.

492
00:33:58,033 --> 00:33:58,858
Scott: vote on that law.

493
00:33:59,159 --> 00:33:59,320
Scott: vote.

494
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:01,468
Scott: Yes, there are no more ads anywhere ever.

495
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:03,115
Scott: or the CEOs in prison.

496
00:34:03,215 --> 00:34:05,991
Scott: Either one of those is fantastic I'm not even joking.

497
00:34:06,535 --> 00:34:07,019
Scott: Just do that.

498
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:11,924
Rym: but anyway things Of the day.

499
00:34:12,246 --> 00:34:14,273
Rym: so check this out.

500
00:34:14,373 --> 00:34:16,260
Rym: This is actually a really simple video.

501
00:34:17,063 --> 00:34:21,400
Rym: It's smarter every day, but I don't think I've ever actually linked to them or if I ever was a long long time ago.

502
00:34:22,062 --> 00:34:31,580
Rym: But they did a really really simple video and I want this is my thing of the day to prove a point This is just a video on how to use the snatch block and like how a block and tackle works.

503
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:32,463
Rym: But it's not like.

504
00:34:32,484 --> 00:34:36,520
Rym: the high school physics demonstration of this is why pulleys are magic.

505
00:34:37,101 --> 00:34:42,000
Rym: It's actually much more focused on the practical aspects of pulleys.

506
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:46,690
Scott: Because okay a lot like we've done a pulley thing of the day in the past.

507
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:48,879
Rym: Uh, not definitely not done this.

508
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:56,288
Scott: I've definitely watched a whole bunch of videos in my life where it's like someone lifts a real heavy thing with a rope because they Got like seven pulleys in line.

509
00:34:56,309 --> 00:34:57,374
Rym: Yeah, this is not that though.

510
00:34:57,415 --> 00:35:03,840
Rym: This is more like Practically like how do you how do you as a person in your day-to-day life?

511
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,579
Rym: Quickly and effectively deploy pulleys to solve real problems?

512
00:35:08,304 --> 00:35:09,854
Scott: I'm a bicycle effectively kinda.

513
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:19,717
Rym: Yeah, and I you know as much as I'm very like a lot of us especially like they kind of nerd to listen to a podcast and cares About embedded ads in their smart TV garage your garage door.

514
00:35:19,938 --> 00:35:20,942
Rym: Yep They're.

515
00:35:20,962 --> 00:35:29,373
Rym: uh, this is more like if you have to make a pulley or like deal with a pulley quickly or solve a problem Like I don't know you ran your car into a ditch.

516
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:30,440
Rym: How do you get the car out of a ditch?

517
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:48,996
Rym: there's a difference between you call for having this abstract knowledge of how technology works like how to use a winch and having an intuitive and internalized understanding of how to apply Very simple and effective technology to quickly solve problems people are able to do.

518
00:35:49,036 --> 00:35:54,753
Rym: the latter tend to Survive things better and be more effective in their day-to-day lives.

519
00:35:55,035 --> 00:35:56,280
Rym: That's an observation I've had.

520
00:35:56,824 --> 00:36:03,719
Scott: I'm gonna try to focus use a pulley Directly think about it.

521
00:36:03,982 --> 00:36:08,731
Rym: I had to use a pulley Was actually in like a for real right like solving a realm with the pulley.

522
00:36:09,052 --> 00:36:11,060
Rym: was we got a Jeep stuck in a ditch?

523
00:36:13,255 --> 00:36:15,066
Rym: But Basically, all right.

524
00:36:15,086 --> 00:36:15,548
Rym: All right, Scott.

525
00:36:15,568 --> 00:36:16,071
Rym: You got a Jeep.

526
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:17,720
Rym: It's got a winch on the front.

527
00:36:18,061 --> 00:36:19,407
Scott: I don't have a Jeep and I never will.

528
00:36:19,527 --> 00:36:22,680
Rym: let's say you do because you're driving off into the wilderness to find the last.

529
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:28,100
Rym: That's some crazy billionaire hid in the wilderness and you know where it is.

530
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:33,019
Rym: I'll come up and tell me to tell you're in a Jeep and you get the Jeep stuck in a ditch.

531
00:36:34,181 --> 00:36:35,450
Rym: How do you get the Jeep out of it there?

532
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:36,759
Scott: I'll leave it there and walk.

533
00:36:37,661 --> 00:36:37,963
Rym: All right.

534
00:36:38,365 --> 00:36:41,720
Rym: It is you cannot make it out of the wilderness without driving.

535
00:36:42,381 --> 00:36:43,626
Scott: I'll call for help on my phone.

536
00:36:43,747 --> 00:36:45,475
Rym: your phone is dead because you're in the middle of the wilderness.

537
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:47,745
Scott: use a helicopter There's.

538
00:36:47,765 --> 00:36:54,031
Rym: you only have a Jeep walk You'll do okay you starve to death before you make it to the edge of the wilderness.

539
00:36:54,874 --> 00:36:56,440
Scott: why I deserve it for deepen.

540
00:36:58,941 --> 00:37:12,920
Rym: Anyway, there's a naive way to use a winch and a Very smart way to use a winch and this is the kind of practical knowledge that people who do real physical work No But a lot of nerds as much as they think oh I know about a nuclear weapons work and I know how a gun works.

541
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,843
Rym: I know a pulleys work.

542
00:37:14,405 --> 00:37:24,379
Rym: There are the practical application of those simple like how to practically apply a lever Not actually that obvious or intuitive to most people and they tend to fuck it up no matter how smart they are.

543
00:37:25,922 --> 00:37:30,928
Scott: All right, so I don't know if I've mentioned it on the show before I probably have.

544
00:37:30,969 --> 00:37:33,325
Scott: there's a thing called Pico 8.

545
00:37:33,325 --> 00:37:40,898
Scott: I think we may have talked about this when we talked about Gamer X at some point because there were some really good Pico 8 games at gamer X when we went in New York.

546
00:37:41,821 --> 00:37:42,984
Rym: God that was a long time ago.

547
00:37:43,566 --> 00:37:46,574
Scott: Pico 8 is a fantasy game console.

548
00:37:46,675 --> 00:37:48,580
Scott: It doesn't actually exist, right?

549
00:37:48,981 --> 00:37:55,000
Scott: They just came up with right this game and there's actually some competitors or not necessarily competitors.

550
00:37:55,081 --> 00:37:57,399
Scott: but there's a few of these right where?

551
00:37:58,301 --> 00:38:01,580
Scott: What if a game console existed that had this chip in it?

552
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:06,340
Scott: Right, so they just make an emulator for a chip that never existed, right?

553
00:38:07,061 --> 00:38:11,080
Scott: And it's like you just made a console and now people can make games for that console.

554
00:38:12,102 --> 00:38:15,520
Scott: So Pico 8 is one of those that makes games with a particular aesthetic.

555
00:38:16,802 --> 00:38:29,957
Scott: But you know and there's been a lot of really high-quality Pico 8 games I've seen in my time Especially on itch.io and but I've discovered this recently because everyone is tweeting about it I think it had maybe a big release or something.

556
00:38:30,017 --> 00:38:35,509
Scott: I don't know But What this is is Pico CAD.

557
00:38:36,091 --> 00:38:39,040
Scott: It is itself a Pico 8 application.

558
00:38:39,181 --> 00:38:43,316
Scott: So you need to run it on a Pico 8 and it will any or on.

559
00:38:43,356 --> 00:38:46,313
Scott: you know in your browser You can run the Pico 8 emulator, right?

560
00:38:46,333 --> 00:38:46,615
Scott: It's just.

561
00:38:46,897 --> 00:38:47,340
Scott: it's just free.

562
00:38:48,869 --> 00:39:00,540
Scott: and then It lets you make a 3d model and sort of color it and texture it as really simple Pixley 3d model that looks like it's from something even less than like a PlayStation 1.

563
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:10,160
Scott: We're talking like Virtua racing from Sega, but maybe with like better color and textures on it And you can't make your model too complex or obviously you start to run out.

564
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,657
Scott: You know hit the limitation the artificial limitations of the Pico 8 console.

565
00:39:13,677 --> 00:39:14,340
Scott: that doesn't exist.

566
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:27,671
Scott: but you can make 3d models of like a particular and awesome aesthetic using Pico CAD and then you can use those tiny models in Perhaps some other Pico software you're gonna use.

567
00:39:27,711 --> 00:39:29,840
Scott: it just exports to like totally normal files.

568
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,738
Scott: You can load them into like, you know, whatever.

569
00:39:32,758 --> 00:39:36,172
Rym: well It looks like the most recent update is exporting to OBS and MTL.

570
00:39:36,393 --> 00:39:38,220
Rym: so you can import them into like blender and unity.

571
00:39:38,423 --> 00:39:39,360
Scott: Yeah, you get unity.

572
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:39,882
Scott: Yep, you can.

573
00:39:39,902 --> 00:39:46,304
Scott: just you can make stuff in Pico CAD and then import it into your actual Outside software.

574
00:39:46,344 --> 00:39:49,677
Scott: Yeah, and perhaps I don't know if you can do vice-versa.

575
00:39:49,918 --> 00:39:50,260
Scott: I don't know.

576
00:39:52,202 --> 00:39:54,669
Rym: This is just looks really cute and easy.

577
00:39:54,709 --> 00:39:56,233
Scott: Yeah, this is is.

578
00:39:56,313 --> 00:40:00,920
Scott: quite imagine if there was like, you know It's almost like a Mario Paint situation, right?

579
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:04,380
Scott: Where it's like, ah, you can use your Super Nintendo to make Super Nintendo sprites.

580
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:10,888
Scott: So you can use your Pico 8, you know, you're in quotes your Pico 8 To make Pico 8 models, right?

581
00:40:11,249 --> 00:40:12,934
Rym: Has anyone made a physical Pico 8?

582
00:40:12,934 --> 00:40:15,422
Scott: I Mean generally.

583
00:40:15,442 --> 00:40:19,419
Scott: you can just take like a Raspberry Pi put it into a box and run Pico 8 on it, right?

584
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:23,835
Scott: So and then you can put Pico 8 ROMs right onto cartridges.

585
00:40:24,036 --> 00:40:26,605
Scott: I'm sure someone's done that There's.

586
00:40:26,767 --> 00:40:27,740
Scott: there are some competitors.

587
00:40:27,861 --> 00:40:34,972
Scott: I forget what they're called because I think Pico 8 itself technically isn't like the open source Like it doesn't cost any money, but I don't think it's open source.

588
00:40:34,992 --> 00:40:36,560
Scott: I'm not sure there's another one.

589
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,009
Scott: I think that is fully open source.

590
00:40:38,029 --> 00:40:39,358
Scott: That's a little different but not bad.

591
00:40:39,378 --> 00:40:40,825
Scott: I Look it up.

592
00:40:41,286 --> 00:40:41,568
Rym: I don't know.

593
00:40:41,668 --> 00:40:44,720
Rym: Yep, but that's it in the meta moment.

594
00:40:44,861 --> 00:40:47,880
Rym: We're still stuck at home, but we are reading the tail.

595
00:40:48,081 --> 00:40:51,411
Scott: I am reading the tail, but I am progressing.

596
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,535
Rym: Hanzo is done.

597
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:53,458
Rym: We're back to Genji.

598
00:40:53,498 --> 00:40:53,960
Rym: Here we go.

599
00:40:54,180 --> 00:41:07,044
Scott: Yeah, the first novel that has ever existed the first You know literature written by a human that that is in the format known as novel Is the tale of Genji and We are reading that book.

600
00:41:07,245 --> 00:41:15,834
Rym: my advice to you so far if you're picking this book up either because you were finally reading it Or because you're a new listener you just you waited until we started reading it before you dove in.

601
00:41:16,195 --> 00:41:29,000
Rym: my advice is if You read like a page or two and you're a little bit confused like you don't know exactly who one of the characters is my advice is to just keep going and You'll kind of figure it out later anyway.

602
00:41:29,121 --> 00:41:33,040
Scott: So it won't matter that like if you don't at the beginning of each chapter at least in the edition.

603
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:35,439
Rym: Oh, yeah It gives you a list of all the characters that are in that scene.

604
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:49,880
Scott: right because you know in there trying to keep with the you know, like I guess more and it's not ancient but you know, The traditional older style Japanese that this is written people are referred to obliquely, right?

605
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,047
Scott: Yes in that old style of language.

606
00:41:53,127 --> 00:41:55,935
Scott: People are not always referred to in a clear fashion.

607
00:41:55,975 --> 00:42:02,960
Scott: It would be like if I wrote a Whole something in English and I kept using pronouns all the time, right?

608
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:11,111
Scott: Something or or using other ways to refer to a person like, you know, ah the gamer I just said the gamer every time right and it's like.

609
00:42:11,131 --> 00:42:13,300
Scott: well, you know it but it's in a room full of gamers.

610
00:42:13,442 --> 00:42:14,919
Scott: Which person are they talking about?

611
00:42:17,602 --> 00:42:18,465
Scott: And that's the way there.

612
00:42:18,565 --> 00:42:33,016
Scott: so in trying to keep with that old style language the translation right Uses pronouns and other ways of referring to someone all the time instead of just saying their name often enough Right that you can tell who the hell it is.

613
00:42:34,145 --> 00:42:35,699
Scott: So you have to figure that out?

614
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,387
Rym: But seriously just steamroll through.

615
00:42:38,427 --> 00:42:44,933
Rym: as long as you understand what happened in each scene it all slots together like pretty easily like You'll kind of just get into a groove with it.

616
00:42:45,697 --> 00:42:48,407
Scott: Yep So that's that tale again.

617
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:57,242
Rym: G any other meta things whatsoever Mean there's light at the end of the tunnel on the vaccines to the point to where at some point this year There's a chance.

618
00:42:57,282 --> 00:43:01,755
Rym: Scott and I can record something together again, but there's a non-zero chance, but it's.

619
00:43:02,257 --> 00:43:03,822
Scott: uh, you know There's even.

620
00:43:03,842 --> 00:43:07,137
Scott: there's even a non-zero convention chance, but it's it's way low.

621
00:43:07,378 --> 00:43:14,748
Rym: Yep It gets higher toward the like later in the year like November December definitely But we're talking.

622
00:43:14,789 --> 00:43:16,538
Scott: we're talking like lottery tickets here.

623
00:43:16,578 --> 00:43:16,719
Scott: Yep.

624
00:43:17,342 --> 00:43:30,251
Rym: So, uh, yeah a lot of projects are on hold until post-covid just because like we've said before It is such a pain in the ass to record a panel In this environment that we have only done it when absolutely forced to.

625
00:43:30,994 --> 00:43:31,154
Scott: yeah.

626
00:43:31,937 --> 00:43:33,020
Scott: All right, so cable management.

627
00:43:33,181 --> 00:43:35,512
Scott: I'm pretty sure we did a show on this and you deleted it.

628
00:43:35,693 --> 00:43:35,894
Scott: Yep.

629
00:43:35,974 --> 00:43:48,299
Rym: We did a show in The best I could find September 28th 2017. we did a show on Desks but I poked at it and we seem to almost entirely talk about the form factor of desks themselves.

630
00:43:51,122 --> 00:44:01,300
Rym: And I'm pretty sure I talked a little bit about like rack cable management back in like 2006 but that was back when shows didn't really have topics necessarily.

631
00:44:02,261 --> 00:44:06,979
Rym: Yeah, like we did a show once called games were reviewed like seven tabletop games in a row.

632
00:44:07,842 --> 00:44:13,480
Scott: All right, the point is when it comes to cable management right at least for an everyday or even a technological person.

633
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:18,319
Scott: I really see four four categories right that come to mind in my life, right?

634
00:44:18,459 --> 00:44:21,011
Rym: Yep Well, how do you deal with his telepathic powers?

635
00:44:21,232 --> 00:44:22,940
Rym: How do you deal with his telekinetic powers?

636
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:27,368
Rym: Right my current toad line cable or is he from the future?

637
00:44:27,388 --> 00:44:29,233
Scott: right the four instances.

638
00:44:29,293 --> 00:44:34,567
Scott: I have to manage cables, right are Inside of a computer.

639
00:44:34,587 --> 00:44:36,419
Scott: you're building a computer this cables in it.

640
00:44:36,921 --> 00:44:40,331
Scott: Right, you're outside your computer around your desk.

641
00:44:40,372 --> 00:44:43,100
Scott: You've got your monitors your computer and your mouse your keyboard.

642
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:44,372
Scott: You gotta wire everything together.

643
00:44:44,392 --> 00:44:57,960
Scott: this case to Case three that you're in a data center and there's mostly networking cables, but also power cables and other cables that need Yeah, which if I did professionally for many years, I managed data centers and also like personally pulled cables.

644
00:44:58,381 --> 00:44:59,565
Rym: I can talk about that at length.

645
00:45:00,348 --> 00:45:04,120
Scott: and then the fourth one would be of a home a home theater and you're cabling.

646
00:45:04,521 --> 00:45:09,640
Scott: You know, you got cables going from the TV to your HD PC to your game consoles to your power outlets talk.

647
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:14,180
Scott: Alright, there is some other ones that I have not had to do personally.

648
00:45:14,561 --> 00:45:17,974
Rym: Like we're not talking about like power met cable management in a house.

649
00:45:18,035 --> 00:45:19,440
Rym: Like that's just home, right?

650
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,065
Scott: You might work at a phone company.

651
00:45:21,586 --> 00:45:31,660
Scott: You know, we're not talking about telcos either like you might be in like the the You know stage business theaters you might or concerts and wiring up those sorts of things.

652
00:45:32,441 --> 00:45:33,223
Scott: Or your DJ.

653
00:45:33,243 --> 00:45:34,766
Scott: you got a wire that stuff.

654
00:45:34,786 --> 00:45:40,108
Scott: but most any you know Serious electronic system of any kind.

655
00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:42,657
Scott: we still depend on wires in 2021 to some degree.

656
00:45:44,206 --> 00:45:45,560
Scott: Not everything is wireless.

657
00:45:46,222 --> 00:45:51,537
Scott: So you have to you know, take you know physical, you know lengths of.

658
00:45:52,019 --> 00:45:59,729
Scott: you know Some sort of metal in sort of some sort of shielded sheath of some kind with connectors at the end To connect one thing to another thing.

659
00:46:00,271 --> 00:46:02,800
Scott: and when it's only one thing to another thing, it's easy.

660
00:46:02,941 --> 00:46:04,500
Scott: You just boop boop done, right?

661
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:11,160
Scott: But often you will have several things that need to be connected to several other things in the proximity to each other.

662
00:46:11,723 --> 00:46:14,360
Scott: And if you just connect everything boop boop one at a time.

663
00:46:14,581 --> 00:46:16,869
Scott: It will work and it will also be a mess.

664
00:46:17,009 --> 00:46:27,378
Rym: you get a desk that looks like what my desk looked like in the early days of GeekNights right, so I you got to do some sort of trickery, right?

665
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:41,460
Scott: It's not easy to connect all these wires in such a way that they are a neatly organized Clean and you know pleasing to the eye or perhaps the the you know, the god tier invisible

666
00:46:41,581 --> 00:46:47,612
Rym: Like I'll admit someone like think something that bothers me viscerally whenever I see it even though I would never like to say something.

667
00:46:47,652 --> 00:46:48,515
Rym: if I was in someone's house.

668
00:46:48,897 --> 00:47:01,637
Rym: if there's a really nice TV hanging on the wall and Three or four different cables just coming down the wall at three or four random angles coming to its mentor Well, well that might mean that's my TV, but they're all.

669
00:47:01,979 --> 00:47:10,579
Scott: yeah My mind that my TV doesn't have a pyramid but they're all just sort of going straight down because it's like that's better than the Inverted pyramid in my mind not by much but it is better.

670
00:47:11,144 --> 00:47:12,294
Scott: But I guess mostly just cuz.

671
00:47:12,335 --> 00:47:20,700
Scott: I've got you know I've got the power cable and I've got like three HDMI cables coming out and then I've got for the Wii I've got this component cable.

672
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:22,625
Rym: Yeah I've already decided how I'm gonna handle that.

673
00:47:22,645 --> 00:47:27,018
Rym: I cuz I am gonna hire your guy to mount my TV on the wall.

674
00:47:27,078 --> 00:47:36,620
Rym: after kovin I'm gonna actually mount a cable channel inside of the wall and Have a port at the bottom or he maybe even in the other room for I'd like to do that.

675
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:37,084
Scott: But I don't.

676
00:47:37,225 --> 00:47:37,649
Scott: this isn't?

677
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:37,951
Scott: I don't?

678
00:47:38,012 --> 00:47:42,992
Rym: I rent I don't own Already cut multiple holes in my walls to run cables.

679
00:47:43,012 --> 00:47:43,374
Rym: You know, I'll do.

680
00:47:43,394 --> 00:47:49,604
Rym: when I move out one I might just leave them cuz there's no way the building would notice Like you know through.

681
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:54,624
Rym: oh there's an extra faceplate that looks just like all the faceplates that were there when I moved in over a Decade ago.

682
00:47:54,644 --> 00:47:55,632
Rym: that has some ethernet in it.

683
00:47:55,894 --> 00:47:56,499
Rym: Where does that go?

684
00:47:57,749 --> 00:48:03,337
Scott: I mean if If I wasn't renting I would absolutely do that or two.

685
00:48:03,457 --> 00:48:08,539
Rym: if it was a problem All I'll do is just put plaster over it and leave the cables in the wall and just move out.

686
00:48:09,362 --> 00:48:13,095
Rym: Yeah, but if I was yeah, yeah, but well, I think let's go.

687
00:48:13,116 --> 00:48:14,380
Rym: but I think we'll go inside out.

688
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:16,199
Rym: We'll start with inside the computer to work our way out.

689
00:48:16,481 --> 00:48:27,114
Rym: but the parameter what we're only talking about semi permanent cable installation because Permanent installation is like I am wiring a house fully and permanently.

690
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:42,691
Rym: like these cables will never move Like that's when you're zip tying cables directly together and like permanently sticking them somewhere gluing them whatever putting them inside of something you can't get them out of but and temporary like if I set up a computer in the living room to do.

691
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:46,345
Rym: like all the cables I laid to record that panel are Recorded for packs online.

692
00:48:47,109 --> 00:48:50,827
Rym: I just let them lay everywhere because as soon as I was done recording I rolled them all up and put them away.

693
00:48:50,847 --> 00:48:52,758
Rym: like don't manage those just let it be.

694
00:48:53,724 --> 00:49:02,310
Rym: Yep, exactly inside the computer Counts as semi-permanent because you want it to be nice in there But you don't want to like permanently mount them all somehow.

695
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:05,320
Rym: because what if you add a new hard drive to your computer?

696
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,709
Rym: What if something breaks or changes?

697
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:09,860
Rym: like yeah, there's a lot of reasons.

698
00:49:10,422 --> 00:49:16,710
Rym: You might have to go inside your computer and move one of those cables You also you also want to keep them nice to.

699
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:19,180
Scott: so don't restrict or mess up the airflow in the computer.

700
00:49:19,321 --> 00:49:19,722
Rym: it's funny.

701
00:49:19,823 --> 00:49:22,694
Rym: in the old days this actually like you kids are lucky.

702
00:49:22,794 --> 00:49:26,926
Rym: computer cable management is Orders of magnitude easier than it used to be.

703
00:49:26,966 --> 00:49:29,353
Rym: we used to have these fat ribbon cables.

704
00:49:29,754 --> 00:49:34,651
Rym: They were like two inches wide Yep, and you couldn't even make them smaller.

705
00:49:34,973 --> 00:49:40,219
Rym: if you tried to like bundle them together You get signal interference and like your hard drive would get slower or not work.

706
00:49:40,581 --> 00:49:42,492
Scott: Yep, they used to sell some.

707
00:49:42,532 --> 00:49:46,550
Scott: that would be like, you know That would be sort of do the inverted pyramid on both ends.

708
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:49,220
Scott: Yeah, we're like the middle was wrapped tight around itself.

709
00:49:49,421 --> 00:49:54,079
Rym: Yeah, but those were kind of expensive and sometimes had problems and those came late to the scene later.

710
00:49:55,241 --> 00:49:55,583
Rym: One

711
00:49:55,603 --> 00:50:18,299
Scott: thing that's nice and one thing that's nice nowadays is you might be you know most of the cabling inside of a computer at least, you know in these times is You know If you can make a computer with only m2 drives which I think most people can get away with and maybe have a NAS Then you don't need any of that.

712
00:50:18,701 --> 00:50:27,686
Scott: You can just not have hard drives in your computer that are require any cables and you've just taken away So much of the wires in the computer Like in the old days.

713
00:50:27,706 --> 00:50:31,100
Rym: you had to plug so much crap in like oh you got a CD drive.

714
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:38,051
Rym: I plug the PETA cable in parallel ATA Plug in the magic cable that made audio come out of it.

715
00:50:38,634 --> 00:50:41,865
Scott: Yeah, if you've only got m2 Drives in your computer.

716
00:50:41,905 --> 00:50:46,580
Scott: The only cables you need are basically from the power supply to everything.

717
00:50:48,777 --> 00:50:49,396
Scott: and Is that it?

718
00:50:51,563 --> 00:50:56,402
Rym: The stuff that's on the front of your case into the headers on the motherboard Right.

719
00:50:56,442 --> 00:50:58,187
Scott: Yeah, but there's the magic.

720
00:50:58,588 --> 00:51:16,273
Rym: the thing that changed for all of you isn't just that all this old fuddy-duddy stuff disappeared Like you'll never have to worry about a ribbon cable again in your lives but also cases got way better like computer cases used to just be like No one no one even thought about the user experience of one of these things.

721
00:51:16,334 --> 00:51:21,955
Rym: like you would have to unscrew the entire thing to Like move a hard drive like literally take the whole case apart.

722
00:51:22,277 --> 00:51:26,476
Rym: back in the day Motherboard went straight into the back like there was no room behind the motherboard.

723
00:51:26,496 --> 00:51:30,589
Rym: nowadays Honestly, you know my cable management strategy is buy a nice case.

724
00:51:31,392 --> 00:51:34,280
Rym: it has channels behind the motherboard but inside the case.

725
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,107
Rym: Yeah, cram everything back there.

726
00:51:36,469 --> 00:51:39,260
Rym: Don't really care if it's ugly cuz no one can see it and it's not in the way.

727
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,847
Scott: Yep, that's what I do too.

728
00:51:40,967 --> 00:51:41,630
Scott: It's I do.

729
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:49,338
Rym: there are channels back there with little like Like Multiple sets of channel like it's so fancy channels.

730
00:51:50,762 --> 00:51:52,732
Scott: But basically yeah the way the case is.

731
00:51:52,832 --> 00:51:54,440
Scott: they know what you're gonna be putting in there.

732
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:58,880
Scott: They know the power supply goes here and such and nowadays power supplies of modular cables.

733
00:51:58,980 --> 00:51:59,844
Scott: You don't need to like.

734
00:51:59,884 --> 00:52:05,205
Scott: I used to have all these just cables sitting in the computer because the power supply just had like a big Crazy number of wires come.

735
00:52:05,285 --> 00:52:08,015
Rym: I cut them off one of one of my power supplies.

736
00:52:08,035 --> 00:52:09,480
Scott: It could be a little dangerous.

737
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:10,546
Scott: You got to tie them up, right?

738
00:52:10,606 --> 00:52:11,109
Rym: No, I cut it.

739
00:52:11,149 --> 00:52:13,059
Rym: I cut them off and then I terminated the ends.

740
00:52:13,783 --> 00:52:14,868
Scott: Yeah, you got terminate or something.

741
00:52:14,888 --> 00:52:16,415
Rym: Yeah, but it is leave the bear cow.

742
00:52:16,435 --> 00:52:17,119
Rym: You gotta hang it out.

743
00:52:17,662 --> 00:52:17,964
Scott: There's.

744
00:52:18,286 --> 00:52:20,320
Scott: uh, you know now they're modular power supplies.

745
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:23,312
Scott: You only put the few the cables you need and no extras, right?

746
00:52:23,412 --> 00:52:24,697
Scott: Yeah, then you take those.

747
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:26,042
Scott: they go There's a hole.

748
00:52:26,062 --> 00:52:31,200
Scott: there'll be a hole near the near the power supply where those cables can go directly behind the motherboard.

749
00:52:31,361 --> 00:52:34,250
Scott: Right because the motherboards aren't mounted on a plate.

750
00:52:34,631 --> 00:52:43,720
Scott: then they can go up or sideways or wherever they need to go And then there'll be holes near the places they need to pop out and then directly attached to whatever they need to attach to you.

751
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:48,460
Scott: So it's like ah, there's where the motherboard has its ATX power connector and there's a hole right next to it.

752
00:52:48,781 --> 00:52:51,832
Scott: So the power supply cable goes behind where no one can see.

753
00:52:51,873 --> 00:53:00,380
Scott: it pops out in the front connects And then once you've connected everything on that back plate behind the motherboard are like little ties.

754
00:53:00,862 --> 00:53:05,900
Scott: So you can sort of bundle the cables together into little groups, you know, so they're not just you know a mess.

755
00:53:06,001 --> 00:53:07,390
Scott: But even if they are a mess doesn't matter.

756
00:53:07,410 --> 00:53:08,296
Scott: This is fun.

757
00:53:08,578 --> 00:53:14,086
Rym: Yep In fact, you can even leave a few extra cables back there and tuck the ends out of the way And then you buy a new hard drive.

758
00:53:14,308 --> 00:53:15,877
Rym: Just pull those little ends out plug them in.

759
00:53:15,897 --> 00:53:16,259
Rym: good to go.

760
00:53:17,203 --> 00:53:24,720
Scott: Yeah, even if you do have you know SATA cables still like I do it's like yeah, you can route them generally with the same kind of method.

761
00:53:24,963 --> 00:53:25,997
Scott: You know depends on your case.

762
00:53:26,412 --> 00:53:30,400
Scott: Yeah But just just try to hide as much as you can then your case will look pretty nice.

763
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:32,454
Rym: Cool thing is a lot of modern no one can see.

764
00:53:32,514 --> 00:53:42,640
Rym: behind the motherboard we'll have a whole separate section in the bottom for basically just the power supply and Usually if you do have giant old spin and hard disks, they usually put racks down there for those too.

765
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:43,989
Rym: So they're just completely invisible.

766
00:53:44,412 --> 00:53:44,614
Scott: Yep.

767
00:53:44,815 --> 00:53:44,996
Scott: Yep.

768
00:53:45,077 --> 00:53:50,820
Rym: Yep What the listener pointed out the fans fans in the early days when all they just need power.

769
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:52,711
Rym: It used to be easy cases.

770
00:53:52,751 --> 00:53:57,300
Rym: Just didn't have fans usually Mmm, then there's beard fans.

771
00:53:57,341 --> 00:53:58,599
Rym: There's nothing to plug them into.

772
00:53:59,182 --> 00:54:00,366
Rym: You'd have to like your motherboard.

773
00:54:00,567 --> 00:54:05,360
Scott: your motherboard has spots for the power to go and if it's a fan that needs power supply power You do the same thing.

774
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:07,449
Scott: no higher goes back and then it pops out near the fan.

775
00:54:07,489 --> 00:54:07,550
Scott: and

776
00:54:07,570 --> 00:54:23,660
Rym: the cool thing is most nice cases will come with fans like Already in all the right spots and usually even have cables running through the channels to the place That's likely near where you're gonna have to plug them into the motherboard like standardization happened of all the things that the ATX specification didn't specify.

777
00:54:24,101 --> 00:54:30,200
Rym: Kind of naturally and you'll always be able to take advantage of that unless you buy a super shitty off-brand case.

778
00:54:31,201 --> 00:54:31,362
Scott: Yep.

779
00:54:32,145 --> 00:54:32,426
Scott: All right.

780
00:54:32,446 --> 00:54:36,060
Scott: So the next kind of cable routing let's go to the the TV area, right?

781
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:48,090
Scott: So as room was saying, you know If you've got a situation where the TV itself like mine has like four HDMI cables going into it gives you got to switch it to Nintendo switches and an HD PC and all this stuff, right?

782
00:54:49,981 --> 00:54:54,860
Scott: If your TV's on a table of some kind it's not too big a deal, right?

783
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:59,900
Scott: You can just do sort of normal cable routing right, you know tie things up nicely with cable.

784
00:54:59,943 --> 00:55:09,906
Rym: Yeah all my cables are tied up with cable ties sitting behind the like Entertainment center shelf where unless you really go back there and look like you're not gonna see him Every single cable I have.

785
00:55:09,986 --> 00:55:30,978
Scott: I went on the internet a few years ago and I bought a package of like a hundred You know hook and loop for a velcro cable ties and what I did is basically every single cable I owned Except for the ones inside a computer, but even some of the ones in the computer But mostly the outside computer ones USB cables HDMI cables power K all those sort, right?

786
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:39,253
Scott: I any time I came across a cable that did not have a cable tie on it I put a cable tie on it and that cable tie could be used.

787
00:55:39,454 --> 00:55:42,459
Scott: if the cable is put away I'm not using it right now.

788
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:53,780
Scott: I could bundle it up with that little cable tie and if I am using it I can bundle up the slack on the cable with a little cable tie or Combine it with other cables because they all have cable ties, right?

789
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:57,372
Scott: They can grab on to each other to form a nice cable channel.

790
00:55:57,412 --> 00:56:00,878
Scott: That is nice and clean instead of a spread out You know indecipherable mess.

791
00:56:01,886 --> 00:56:02,638
Scott: So that's step one.

792
00:56:03,563 --> 00:56:07,865
Scott: But if your TV's up on the wall Elevated Rym was correct.

793
00:56:07,905 --> 00:56:12,260
Scott: It looks fugly as mine does where the cables are just coming down the wall.

794
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:16,420
Rym: My best advice is mount as much as you can on the back of the TV.

795
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:27,547
Rym: I see a lot of people do this like they'll mount the TV on the wall But they'll also stick stuff like the power like anything they need to make the TV work or even a tiny HDPC in some cases an Apple.

796
00:56:27,627 --> 00:56:31,260
Scott: an Apple TV can hang on the back of a television really easily.

797
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:31,743
Scott: It's tiny.

798
00:56:31,804 --> 00:56:33,454
Scott: my HDPC is too big for that.

799
00:56:33,494 --> 00:56:43,472
Scott: Yeah But it would be possible for me if I really wanted to to mount the HDPC on the wall behind the TV.

800
00:56:43,592 --> 00:56:44,275
Scott: it could happen.

801
00:56:44,716 --> 00:56:49,392
Scott: right now You're thinking wait a minute you put more stuff on the wall more stuff on the TV.

802
00:56:49,693 --> 00:56:52,983
Scott: those cables still need to go down Right somewhere.

803
00:56:53,023 --> 00:56:57,620
Scott: well no not really because what happens is the HDMI cables are now all in one place, right?

804
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:01,012
Scott: They're going from the devices on the wall into the television.

805
00:57:01,032 --> 00:57:03,180
Scott: They're all up there already hiding behind the TV.

806
00:57:04,161 --> 00:57:05,807
Scott: The power cables need to go somewhere.

807
00:57:05,827 --> 00:57:09,620
Scott: well what you do is you take your power strip, and you put that up there.

808
00:57:09,741 --> 00:57:12,725
Rym: Oh now You just got to get one cable to that TV.

809
00:57:12,746 --> 00:57:21,846
Scott: now the only cable that has to come down from the TV is the Power cable from the power strip and you can hide it in a channel or hide it in the wall Or something else like that.

810
00:57:21,866 --> 00:57:31,691
Scott: if you can't do that you can do a rims doing which is where The cables go into the wall or into a plate that's on the wall Right and then you have sort of down near the floor.

811
00:57:31,932 --> 00:57:34,040
Scott: you have some sort of exit where the cables come out.

812
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:38,317
Scott: Yeah, and then that stuff is where you connect to everything else in a hidden fashion.

813
00:57:38,397 --> 00:57:39,080
Rym: I like the plates.

814
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:46,432
Rym: I like the idea of you have plates where like you could like they literally have like HDMI and DisplayPort and USB like ports on them.

815
00:57:46,653 --> 00:57:52,692
Scott: right yeah up on high on the wall HDMI hole you know and on the low on the wall is an HDMI hole.

816
00:57:52,852 --> 00:58:01,562
Scott: inside the wall is an HDMI cable as long as You never have to upgrade that HDMI cable to a newer standard yeah, and even if you do It's only a minor pain in the ass I guess.

817
00:58:02,105 --> 00:58:26,779
Rym: but another way to go that actually is a lot easier for people is You might have what one of those two might have the whole like the proper like plug just coming out of the wall usually the One that's the most visible, but on the other end of it usually hidden behind the TV you get a face plate That's basically just an open hole with some stuff to make it easy for cables to like kind of hang there easily And just jam the cables into the wall through that big hole because no one will see the hole

818
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:28,099
Scott: exactly.

819
00:58:29,142 --> 00:58:30,390
Scott: But yeah, you just want to find.

820
00:58:30,451 --> 00:58:31,699
Scott: it's really about that gap.

821
00:58:31,921 --> 00:58:37,220
Scott: You know that's where the unseemliness is between the TV and the you know because your power outlets are gonna be near the floor.

822
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:46,419
Scott: I guess if you make your own house isn't that you put the power outlets up near the TV And get really fancy right if your TVs on certain kinds of arms for mounting right.

823
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:50,727
Scott: so my Arm doesn't have this too much as a little bit bit But my monitor arms.

824
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:55,329
Scott: in the arm of my monitors There is a channel for cables to go.

825
00:58:55,389 --> 00:58:58,200
Scott: so basically all the cables from the monitor get bundled up.

826
00:58:58,521 --> 00:59:01,850
Scott: They go into this channel, and then they exit at the.

827
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:06,267
Scott: you know where the mom where the the arm clamps right onto the back Of my desk.

828
00:59:06,307 --> 00:59:07,136
Scott: they exit there.

829
00:59:08,244 --> 00:59:11,460
Scott: So you really you know don't have them just like flopping all over the place.

830
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:13,997
Scott: It's pretty nice, and you know TVs can do a similar thing.

831
00:59:14,118 --> 00:59:19,760
Scott: find You know some sort of channel or pipe or race way or something to for cables to go?

832
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,229
Rym: Yeah, when in doubt if you're on it's all.

833
00:59:22,290 --> 00:59:23,494
Scott: it's about aesthetics right?

834
00:59:23,535 --> 00:59:24,880
Scott: the cables themselves are ugly.

835
00:59:25,162 --> 00:59:29,198
Scott: You just trying to hide them yep Them in like a tube.

836
00:59:29,942 --> 00:59:36,929
Rym: But as a matter they're actually if you're willing to put up with cutting them to the right length yourself And you're okay with them smelling bad for like a week.

837
00:59:37,611 --> 00:59:40,220
Rym: go on Amazon and buy like the cheapest cable channels.

838
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:42,692
Rym: They usually stick to your wall with like adhesive tape.

839
00:59:43,255 --> 00:59:47,000
Rym: they look fine They just work and they really clean everything up.

840
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:50,614
Rym: Just get like some black or white ones and just plan them in advance like.

841
00:59:50,635 --> 00:59:56,960
Rym: the only other thing you really got to think about Is plan what you're gonna do before you start sticking stuff in places and how long?

842
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:58,463
Scott: Lengths right you're gonna need.

843
00:59:58,524 --> 01:00:06,267
Scott: as soon as when you try to organize things into channels that takes because you're not taking a direct route From point A to point B You're routing your go.

844
01:00:06,327 --> 01:00:08,120
Rym: cables need to be longer than you might realize.

845
01:00:08,962 --> 01:00:10,747
Scott: You need more length than you realize.

846
01:00:10,767 --> 01:00:15,440
Scott: you have to consider the maximum lengths possible for certain kinds of cables when you're doing this right.

847
01:00:15,782 --> 01:00:17,310
Scott: Yeah, I'm not any granted.

848
01:00:17,331 --> 01:00:23,613
Scott: You know there's the advertised Specified lengths for different cable standards, and I have never.

849
01:00:23,753 --> 01:00:28,028
Scott: I've seen many cables exceed those specs And I've never seen one not work.

850
01:00:28,370 --> 01:00:31,383
Rym: I've seen higher end like later USB.

851
01:00:31,443 --> 01:00:37,126
Rym: that's too long has trouble, but like USB 2 you can make a USB 2 cable Scarily.

852
01:00:37,207 --> 01:00:38,633
Scott: I've seen Ethernet so long.

853
01:00:38,673 --> 01:00:39,899
Scott: it shouldn't have worked, but it worked.

854
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:50,936
Rym: But the thing I got to do is I'm actually gonna mount the dock for the switch on the wall, I think You can do that right next to the TV.

855
01:00:52,002 --> 01:00:54,390
Scott: Yeah, there are other solutions to get creative for things like that.

856
01:00:54,410 --> 01:00:58,223
Scott: you know cuz the the switch itself the bottom of it is just USB-c.

857
01:00:58,243 --> 01:01:04,160
Scott: yeah, so you could do is you could have like you know you could get some third-party switch dock.

858
01:01:04,301 --> 01:01:05,266
Scott: That's like the one I have.

859
01:01:05,307 --> 01:01:07,500
Scott: that's like just like a little adapter kind of guy.

860
01:01:07,881 --> 01:01:13,325
Scott: You can hide that and just have a USB-c cable like off in the corner somewhere So you don't even have a switch dock.

861
01:01:13,365 --> 01:01:17,562
Rym: or I mean the pro move is I would like to route a few cables like through The ceiling.

862
01:01:17,582 --> 01:01:19,129
Rym: I don't have any place to do this in this apartment.

863
01:01:19,169 --> 01:01:22,106
Rym: obviously like I can't dig it as much as I'm saying I'll dig Into my walls.

864
01:01:22,450 --> 01:01:31,999
Rym: I'm not digging into my floor But I would love to run like some USB and a couple other cables From that wall under the floor to like behind the couch.

865
01:01:32,687 --> 01:01:37,072
Rym: So if I'm sitting there I could plug something like say I needed to use a wired controller for some reason.

866
01:01:37,312 --> 01:01:41,059
Rym: just plug it in right there that yep That is like S-tier.

867
01:01:41,842 --> 01:01:47,000
Scott: Yeah, if you want to get something from the TV to the couch right the best thing to do is called a raceway.

868
01:01:47,143 --> 01:01:47,899
Scott: You've probably seen it.

869
01:01:48,041 --> 01:01:49,499
Scott: It's basically like a little rubber guy.

870
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:50,883
Scott: That's you know.

871
01:01:51,023 --> 01:01:53,833
Scott: and the point of these is actually more of a safety issue.

872
01:01:53,853 --> 01:02:01,980
Scott: if you're setting up something temporary You'll just use like duct tape to cover cables because people could trip over them when they're running around on the floor, right?

873
01:02:02,481 --> 01:02:05,031
Scott: but if you have a more permanent situation where this?

874
01:02:05,131 --> 01:02:10,708
Scott: you know, maybe you're in a conference room in an office and The Kate the conference tables in the middle of the room.

875
01:02:11,330 --> 01:02:15,464
Scott: all the cables on the conference table go into the middle down Inside the table.

876
01:02:15,504 --> 01:02:19,740
Scott: So the table is clean, but then they have to come out the bottom of the table and they're all together.

877
01:02:20,162 --> 01:02:23,216
Scott: But they need to get to the wall and the wall is far away from the table.

878
01:02:23,497 --> 01:02:24,200
Scott: So you have this thing.

879
01:02:24,221 --> 01:02:32,900
Scott: It's a raceway Is what it's called and it's basically just like a little rubber Thing with holes in it and all the cables can go into it on one side and out on the other.

880
01:02:33,302 --> 01:02:36,620
Scott: But when you plop it on the floor, the bottom of it is flat.

881
01:02:36,761 --> 01:02:40,120
Scott: So it lies flat on the floor and the top of it is rounded.

882
01:02:40,421 --> 01:02:52,140
Scott: So if you have like a chair with wheels or a wheelchair Or any sort of thing that needs to you know, move around a person's foot You won't trip over it because it's just a rounded thing on the ground.

883
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:52,341
Scott: Yeah,

884
01:02:52,421 --> 01:03:08,560
Rym: like in our own the old house and beacon to get a cable where we needed because we we tried to run it through The walls but like the interior walls were insulated for some reason like that house was weird but We'd literally just crammed the cables into the corner of the room like kind of into the car where the carpet met the wall.

885
01:03:08,861 --> 01:03:10,185
Rym: I just jammed it under there.

886
01:03:10,246 --> 01:03:14,159
Rym: that actually works pretty well, especially in older houses that have carpet.

887
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:24,520
Scott: Yeah, or you can go up and over doorways or and unless it's a power cable You can just like run it under your computer the TV or around the desk, right?

888
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:29,282
Scott: That's the main situation with the desk Computer.

889
01:03:29,443 --> 01:03:33,279
Scott: is it gonna be on the floor or is it gonna be up on the desk, right if it's down on the floor?

890
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:41,329
Scott: Your challenge is the cables that go from up to down right again up, you know Same as the TV situation right from your monitor to the bottom.

891
01:03:41,349 --> 01:03:48,040
Scott: My advice is one if you had hands to the bottom However, you're gonna make those transitions, right?

892
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:53,580
Rym: Yeah, if you can do it get a power strip mounted on your side of the desk go into the other side of the desk.

893
01:03:53,640 --> 01:04:00,959
Scott: So like for example on the right side of my desk, I've got like there's a scanner way over there But my computer is way on the left side of my test.

894
01:04:01,842 --> 01:04:08,500
Scott: So I got like an extra long USB cable and need some sort of horizontal path for it to go without just sort of draping.

895
01:04:09,862 --> 01:04:25,778
Scott: so they do make desks that have like channels in the back for things to go horizontally and what you can do then with those is take all the cables that are on the desk and send them into the channel and then Underneath the desk everything exits the horizontal channel where the computer is and goes straight

896
01:04:25,798 --> 01:04:25,998
Rym: down.

897
01:04:26,139 --> 01:04:28,358
Scott: Yep And that's a good way to go.

898
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:32,456
Rym: Now the the cheat mode is if you have a big enough space is you can just buy those.

899
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:34,629
Scott: I Can't hear him at all.

900
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:41,160
Rym: Oh you finally noticed It's got finally noticed that he couldn't hear that he was not hearing my audio.

901
01:04:42,842 --> 01:04:44,754
Scott: Yeah, I finally noticed why I couldn't hear your audio.

902
01:04:44,794 --> 01:04:45,559
Rym: Oh, you can hear me again.

903
01:04:46,662 --> 01:04:48,597
Scott: Yeah, I I was trying to.

904
01:04:48,698 --> 01:04:56,840
Scott: I Was trying to turn on the hockey game - I didn't want the hockey audio to interfere with the podcast.

905
01:04:57,041 --> 01:04:59,891
Rym: Yeah, I can't earning because of the way I capture your voice.

906
01:04:59,991 --> 01:05:01,537
Rym: I can't actually turn on the blab seal.

907
01:05:02,018 --> 01:05:03,765
Rym: Yeah, I Had to.

908
01:05:03,886 --> 01:05:13,237
Rym: I turned off my own headphones Realized I started to talk about cable channels and raceways and stuff and you just didn't?

909
01:05:13,377 --> 01:05:14,180
Rym: you just kept talking.

910
01:05:14,564 --> 01:05:15,797
Rym: So I was like, okay, I'll figure it out.

911
01:05:16,684 --> 01:05:17,389
Scott: Yeah, I figured it out.

912
01:05:17,892 --> 01:05:18,980
Scott: I turned off my own headphones.

913
01:05:22,023 --> 01:05:26,502
Rym: But one thing you can buy if you got like an older desk that doesn't support any of this stuff as long as you have Space for it.

914
01:05:26,884 --> 01:05:33,440
Rym: You can buy these like wire cages that you stick on the back of your desk and just cram everything into these wire cages.

915
01:05:34,824 --> 01:05:43,218
Rym: the other pro tip is Get a power strip that you can mount and my like if you have it one of those desks that has like a top part In the bottom part.

916
01:05:43,661 --> 01:05:57,799
Rym: seriously mount a power strip in the top part like behind where your monitor is gonna go if you have like because then you can Plug your monitor and anything else on your desk like speakers that needs power Into something also on top of the desk without having more cables going down

917
01:05:58,462 --> 01:05:59,325
Scott: The power strip.

918
01:05:59,365 --> 01:06:06,500
Scott: that is not on the floor again same as with the TV situation as a pro move It keeps the power cables from going right from high to low.

919
01:06:06,661 --> 01:06:11,870
Scott: They could just you know, bring and then weigh the power, you know anything that combines Cables right.

920
01:06:11,891 --> 01:06:23,050
Scott: you want to bring the Combining part as close to the things as you can and then just the one cable that comes out of the power strip is the one That makes the long run that where you know is unsightly.

921
01:06:23,090 --> 01:06:24,173
Scott: but it's like it's not unsightly.

922
01:06:24,213 --> 01:06:25,096
Scott: It's just one cable.

923
01:06:25,197 --> 01:06:25,718
Scott: No big deal.

924
01:06:25,778 --> 01:06:37,276
Rym: Yeah The other thing I found is that a cheap way even if you don't make a nice clean aesthetic do something to get your cables off the floor, even if they're still a mess.

925
01:06:37,336 --> 01:06:40,387
Rym: that'll save you a Surprising amount of hassle.

926
01:06:40,488 --> 01:06:50,840
Rym: as the years go on like more than you realize Cables that are touching the ground will accumulate dust and grime that is not actually that easy to get rid of Unless you crawl under there and like wipe them down periodically.

927
01:06:51,282 --> 01:06:52,770
Scott: It's also hard to like vacuum like you ever.

928
01:06:52,810 --> 01:06:54,036
Scott: take your vacuum and you go down there.

929
01:06:54,056 --> 01:06:54,700
Scott: It's just cables.

930
01:06:54,921 --> 01:06:58,133
Rym: You know vacuum are you trying to sweep and you know and they're touching the ground.

931
01:06:58,173 --> 01:07:00,323
Rym: you might like sweep a cable out from under Your desk.

932
01:07:00,606 --> 01:07:00,969
Rym: Oh fuck.

933
01:07:00,989 --> 01:07:02,059
Rym: What was that even plugged into?

934
01:07:02,841 --> 01:07:06,800
Scott: Yeah, so my cable game right now on my my desk is kind of good.

935
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:10,473
Scott: it's like the best I've had it but it's not perfect right because I've got some.

936
01:07:10,674 --> 01:07:15,258
Scott: I got some speaker cables going up to the Ceiling way above to a high shelf and they're not hidden at all.

937
01:07:15,801 --> 01:07:19,451
Scott: They're just you know, they're they're tied together, but it's still not that great.

938
01:07:19,571 --> 01:07:22,540
Rym: I've got a horizontal while on my desk.

939
01:07:22,901 --> 01:07:27,000
Scott: I've hidden everything but once you go underneath the desk, it's hideous, right?

940
01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:30,172
Rym: So Emily's all that in a way, you know, she did under the desk.

941
01:07:30,514 --> 01:07:35,760
Rym: She put her computer back Like straight behind where her feet are and turned it sideways.

942
01:07:35,941 --> 01:07:41,339
Rym: So the glass and all the bling is pointing out and all the cables are just behind the computer where no one can see them.

943
01:07:42,844 --> 01:07:45,947
Scott: No, maybe but yeah I think I'm gonna basically make a little plan.

944
01:07:46,067 --> 01:07:49,480
Scott: figure out everything every wire like a little piece of paper.

945
01:07:49,721 --> 01:07:55,120
Scott: Right the length I need for each one maybe buy some accessories, right and then yeah the play.

946
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:57,007
Rym: I guess that's the advice for all of this.

947
01:07:57,369 --> 01:08:00,320
Rym: make a plan like literally sit down with a piece of paper.

948
01:08:00,443 --> 01:08:01,178
Rym: Look at your desk.

949
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:06,940
Rym: Didn't like write down all the things that need to be plugged in and what they need to be plugged into and draw?

950
01:08:07,622 --> 01:08:09,039
Rym: Where are these cables gonna run?

951
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:10,605
Rym: how do I want this to look like?

952
01:08:10,826 --> 01:08:21,180
Rym: the more you plan in advance the more you can get the right tools to do the Job, and even if you do something kind of inelegant and hackish You'll at least have a plan going in and it'll turn out way better.

953
01:08:21,783 --> 01:08:26,339
Scott: Yeah, and if you go online look at examples of what other people have done There isn't like one best way.

954
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:30,479
Scott: But there are people who have like setups where like you don't see any wires at all.

955
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:34,680
Scott: Yeah, a lot of those people are doing stuff like wireless mouse keyboard and you know.

956
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:39,319
Rym: So a lot of those people live in not New York, so they have a slightly bigger area to work with than I do.

957
01:08:40,361 --> 01:08:41,023
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

958
01:08:41,042 --> 01:08:44,274
Scott: They have less constraints and whatnot or they can modify their walls.

959
01:08:44,295 --> 01:08:46,522
Scott: Yes like that, but You can.

960
01:08:46,803 --> 01:08:52,057
Scott: you can go really and get pretty fancy and learn from what other people have done with fancy setups.

961
01:08:52,136 --> 01:08:56,019
Scott: and you know It's just like it's nice to not have wires everywhere.

962
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:57,564
Scott: Yeah, right.

963
01:08:57,823 --> 01:09:02,278
Scott: It just you know, just I even if you just personally you're just like I don't care.

964
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:04,796
Scott: It's like I don't understand that.

965
01:09:05,862 --> 01:09:08,479
Scott: It's like it just feels better to have things be clean.

966
01:09:08,627 --> 01:09:08,733
Scott: Yep

967
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:24,014
Rym: and then when I add something to my setup or change something it's like everything's a lot more modular and easy to work with which Scales up to and we won't talk about this very long because we've got on plenty of time Serious cable management which you can have a full-time job doing and it'll pay pretty well

968
01:09:24,154 --> 01:09:25,578
Scott: right in in the data center.

969
01:09:25,698 --> 01:09:26,582
Rym: that matter.

970
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:29,170
Rym: it's basically all the concerns like even aesthetics.

971
01:09:29,250 --> 01:09:49,979
Rym: aesthetics actually matter to a degree in that kind of environment, but The key the real reason you organize the more serious professional stuff Is that you need to be able to very quickly fix something that went wrong add something remove something change something understand something and You might know where all the stupid cables on your computer go.

972
01:09:50,643 --> 01:09:57,558
Rym: But if someone else comes over to your desk to try to deal with it like something breaks How well are they gonna do if your cables aren't organized?

973
01:09:57,859 --> 01:09:57,960
Rym: now?

974
01:09:57,980 --> 01:10:01,678
Rym: Imagine if that desk is a bunch of servers that are doing something important.

975
01:10:03,341 --> 01:10:09,739
Scott: Yeah, it's like no one has to understand right how my TV is set up right and it's like only I do

976
01:10:10,542 --> 01:10:21,060
Rym: like if I was on a long business trip and Emily had to like Use my computer to recable everything to make GeekNights happen like worst case scenario Unplug everything figure it out plug it all back in like, okay fine.

977
01:10:22,203 --> 01:10:26,016
Scott: Yeah, it's not that many but if you're in a data center It's like you have to know every.

978
01:10:26,258 --> 01:10:32,620
Scott: you know Some whoever's working there has to be able to tell what the hell's going on Even though they weren't involved in setting it up at all.

979
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:37,160
Rym: I don't think I ever touched what the things I used to set up when this was my job.

980
01:10:37,582 --> 01:10:38,546
Rym: I would never touch again.

981
01:10:38,566 --> 01:10:41,620
Rym: other people I never met would touch them if there was a problem.

982
01:10:42,881 --> 01:10:44,587
Rym: So I had to make sure it was perfect.

983
01:10:45,169 --> 01:10:46,995
Rym: and my advice to you professionally.

984
01:10:47,075 --> 01:10:50,653
Rym: there is honestly one Learn from whoever you're working with.

985
01:10:50,673 --> 01:10:58,056
Rym: if you work in a data center It'll be obvious immediately if they're doing a good job or a bad job with this.

986
01:10:58,116 --> 01:11:02,900
Rym: if they're going doing a good job Figure out who made it a good job and learn from them and do whatever they're doing.

987
01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:11,967
Rym: Like don't don't try to reinvent the wheel that the things you might think are an obvious good idea are not for reasons that you Won't know right away if they're doing a bad job.

988
01:11:12,308 --> 01:11:13,772
Rym: You have to make a very important decision.

989
01:11:14,514 --> 01:11:16,078
Rym: Do you care or not?

990
01:11:17,901 --> 01:11:23,928
Rym: Because if you don't care don't touch it because as soon as you touch it or talk about it You're gonna be asked to fix it.

991
01:11:24,571 --> 01:11:26,220
Rym: and that gets to my final piece of advice.

992
01:11:27,721 --> 01:11:34,500
Rym: If I was tasked with setting up a new rack like a like, you know a standard computer rack fully loaded.

993
01:11:34,621 --> 01:11:35,811
Rym: So there's like I don't know 20 40 units.

994
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:41,399
Rym: So say there's four switches and 20 computers and some other bullshit in there.

995
01:11:42,202 --> 01:11:55,398
Rym: I would budget for myself if I was cabling that up and doing nice cable management for full working days Eight hours times four to do those cables, right?

996
01:11:56,480 --> 01:12:08,927
Rym: Mmm, it takes a long time to do it, right and However long you think it's gonna take unless you have been doing it a long time just triple whatever you think and that's the estimate You should go with those four days

997
01:12:08,947 --> 01:12:12,160
Scott: because are including the time it takes to plan it out, right?

998
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:18,340
Scott: It could be a situation usually where it's been planned out and you're just making many racks that are all the same.

999
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:21,960
Scott: Yeah, I'll take four days right but the the planning part, right?

1000
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:25,015
Scott: It's like okay the rack will have this and this and this and this and the wires go here.

1001
01:12:25,035 --> 01:12:29,580
Rym: that will tell you some amount Of time and especially it depends on like yeah Are you just adding like rack?

1002
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:34,096
Rym: 11 to a rat like they're just adding ten more computers of the same kind at the end of a row.

1003
01:12:34,538 --> 01:12:41,329
Rym: or is it like this is a bespoke rack or like you're doing your own thing or Did someone do a bad job and you've been asked to fix it.

1004
01:12:41,751 --> 01:12:44,220
Rym: that task is almost impossible.

1005
01:12:45,261 --> 01:12:50,940
Scott: Also, the one last thing about data centers, is that like, you know, there's messy data center obviously, right?

1006
01:12:51,321 --> 01:12:54,074
Scott: And then there's you look at one that looks really nice.

1007
01:12:54,114 --> 01:12:55,360
Scott: You know, you got all these networking cables.

1008
01:12:55,400 --> 01:13:04,640
Scott: They're going into a nice these channels in between the racks Right, and then they come out the bottom and then they're routed through the floorboards and they're you know standard good job data center.

1009
01:13:05,563 --> 01:13:07,229
Scott: It seems like every couple of years.

1010
01:13:07,309 --> 01:13:14,480
Scott: I'll see a picture of some data center that is doing something That's just like new and incredible and different with your cable man.

1011
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:17,308
Rym: Well, cuz they're so much has changed.

1012
01:13:17,348 --> 01:13:17,489
Rym: like.

1013
01:13:18,090 --> 01:13:21,320
Scott: there are so many new developments in this area.

1014
01:13:21,621 --> 01:13:22,022
Rym: Yeah, like.

1015
01:13:22,042 --> 01:13:25,332
Rym: you'll have a whole row of racks that are all direct DC power.

1016
01:13:25,352 --> 01:13:28,120
Rym: There's no AC power fucking anywhere, right?

1017
01:13:28,422 --> 01:13:30,356
Scott: It's like and you know, that's not even that new.

1018
01:13:30,376 --> 01:13:37,360
Scott: so If you are in an existing data center, you only have to get it up to the good level.

1019
01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:38,647
Scott: That's all that you know, it's like.

1020
01:13:38,848 --> 01:13:40,880
Scott: is that how much better is that better level?

1021
01:13:41,060 --> 01:13:52,351
Scott: But if you're making a new data center Right from nothing you should go and find out the best and the fanciest one and then make sure the whole place Follows the same, you know stuff.

1022
01:13:52,472 --> 01:13:56,086
Scott: even if you're doing different things in different areas Consistency is key.

1023
01:13:56,267 --> 01:14:05,260
Rym: if you're like literally down to the level of This kind of tat like this kind of networking will be on green wires and this other kind will be on blue wires.

1024
01:14:07,121 --> 01:14:10,811
Rym: Like the more standards and like consistency you can make the better.
