1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,535
Rym: It's Monday July 28th 2014.

2
00:00:10,535 --> 00:00:15,546
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:15,847 --> 00:00:20,104
Rym: We talk about children and Technology and the future.

4
00:00:20,124 --> 00:00:23,922
Rym: it's all right Let's do this.

5
00:00:26,516 --> 00:00:40,909
Rym: So my office needed a Security camera just because someone walked into our office like during the day not that long ago went into what like we have a little conference room kind of by the front door and Like they just walked in and took someone's laptop and walked out.

6
00:00:41,572 --> 00:00:42,013
Scott: Awesome good.

7
00:00:42,053 --> 00:00:42,575
Scott: Yeah them.

8
00:00:42,896 --> 00:00:47,770
Rym: so we you know we dealt with that, but the CEO was like we need a security camera.

9
00:00:48,353 --> 00:00:58,720
Rym: And I'm started to learn over the years that in every job I've ever had whenever there's anything that isn't like in the direct purview of like everyone's specific job They call someone else to take.

10
00:00:58,781 --> 00:00:59,507
Rym: no they call me.

11
00:01:00,472 --> 00:01:09,570
Rym: Everywhere I've worked IBM my current company my previous company that hospital anything weird everyone's like hey And they come over to me, and they're like how do we get a security camera?

12
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:17,761
Rym: And if someone else is tasked directly with one of those weird jobs that person will come over to me and ask me Like what do you know about security cameras?

13
00:01:17,802 --> 00:01:19,470
Rym: because they assume that I know something about it.

14
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:22,003
Scott: Is you're the only one knows how to Google exactly so.

15
00:01:22,526 --> 00:01:31,939
Rym: little googling later I found actually that security systems are not that expensive like big ones with like for Night-vision cameras and loaded up with SD cards.

16
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:35,810
Scott: probably just need one camera and a recorder, and that's it yeah.

17
00:01:36,132 --> 00:01:39,232
Rym: So I looked at all these systems, and they were not that expensive And they'd be really.

18
00:01:39,252 --> 00:01:48,950
Rym: you could probably install it yourself trivially like five or six hundred bucks tops for like a really good system That'll keep like a month's worth of HD video and all that stuff and ir splash.

19
00:01:49,652 --> 00:01:54,261
Rym: And then I looked at him, and I realized that if I buy that I'll have to install it.

20
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,070
Rym: I'll have to maintain it.

21
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:59,970
Rym: I'll be in charge of it for as long as I work here which Called like some security company to come do it.

22
00:02:01,073 --> 00:02:02,772
Rym: Oh That's how.

23
00:02:02,913 --> 00:02:04,759
Rym: I'm the phone administrator of this company.

24
00:02:05,181 --> 00:02:06,786
Scott: you're doing the phones - you didn't?

25
00:02:06,806 --> 00:02:07,810
Scott: you don't have a contract for that.

26
00:02:07,931 --> 00:02:08,434
Rym: I am the phone.

27
00:02:08,574 --> 00:02:09,844
Rym: I am the phone person.

28
00:02:10,045 --> 00:02:13,136
Rym: I in fact Am a phone person now.

29
00:02:13,176 --> 00:02:14,501
Scott: Did you set it up with?

30
00:02:14,642 --> 00:02:16,990
Rym: I set up everything power over ethernet up?

31
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,396
Scott: No, it's not VoIP phones.

32
00:02:18,618 --> 00:02:18,718
Rym: No.

33
00:02:18,758 --> 00:02:19,824
Rym: It's not just regular.

34
00:02:19,904 --> 00:02:20,990
Rym: I suggested VoIP phones.

35
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,903
Rym: They didn't want to pay for them, but they're just better in every concern.

36
00:02:24,923 --> 00:02:26,007
Rym: I know don't get me started.

37
00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:30,180
Rym: so Then I realized you know all that.

38
00:02:30,762 --> 00:02:38,788
Rym: so then I just ordered a drop cam and I told the person you know like our office manager like look you can set this up here because it's like you know.

39
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:44,070
Rym: drop cam It's like they didn't set it up up, so they couldn't even though babies first wasn't their fault.

40
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:48,086
Rym: So here's my problem with drop cam because I like drop you couldn't mount it.

41
00:02:48,427 --> 00:02:49,050
Rym: Oh, no none of that.

42
00:02:49,251 --> 00:02:50,034
Rym: I well one.

43
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:53,670
Rym: I'm the only person in this company who drills into drywall.

44
00:02:55,957 --> 00:03:01,940
Scott: Okay Take a drill you aim it at the wall, and you push yeah Just I'm holding the trigger dad make sure it's plugged in.

45
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,550
Scott: make sure that the screw the the drill bit is in tight.

46
00:03:04,973 --> 00:03:13,439
Rym: You know when I went into I feel bit key Was al Biles told me after he played his jazz trumpet and said you should join IT Toodly-toodly-toot you'll make a lot of money.

47
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,619
Rym: Toodly-toodly-toot won't have to do a lot of work Toodly-toodly-toot, and he was a hundred percent accurate.

48
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:21,068
Scott: and all that the guy told me the same thing.

49
00:03:21,088 --> 00:03:26,096
Rym: yep You chose a slightly harder job that pays slightly less But you get to do what you actually want.

50
00:03:26,176 --> 00:03:29,349
Scott: I could make much much more if I so decide I work for me.

51
00:03:30,492 --> 00:03:32,629
Scott: Well, I could work less than 40 hours a week.

52
00:03:32,911 --> 00:03:37,730
Rym: I could make that guarantee, but you'd have to do mostly like really boring Java development.

53
00:03:39,051 --> 00:03:44,150
Scott: Can I sit around and read reddit for most of those less than 40 hours long as you finish the tickets?

54
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,760
Rym: I assigned to you and the code I give you.

55
00:03:46,941 --> 00:03:49,090
Scott: can I bike into work and bring them a bike in the office?

56
00:03:49,292 --> 00:03:49,830
Rym: That's what I do.

57
00:03:50,972 --> 00:03:52,620
Scott: Can I wear like shorts and a t-shirt?

58
00:03:52,761 --> 00:03:54,389
Rym: I've just been fucking wearing shorts to work.

59
00:03:57,215 --> 00:03:59,088
Scott: Can I have like 30 vacation days?

60
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:05,947
Rym: no Anyway, so I get the drop cam and I have a drop cam.

61
00:04:05,987 --> 00:04:09,710
Rym: now like I use it That's our bunny camera or whatever and they're great like I like them.

62
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:12,626
Rym: I'm not gonna review the drop cam on this at work.

63
00:04:12,707 --> 00:04:14,634
Rym: I plug it in Doesn't work.

64
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:19,291
Rym: It's a broken one, and it gives you zero Information.

65
00:04:19,533 --> 00:04:25,400
Rym: it has an LED that can show blue or orange With or without blinking.

66
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,090
Scott: This is what people want Apple products.

67
00:04:27,251 --> 00:04:28,799
Scott: You can't think you did just work.

68
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,563
Rym: so I plug it.

69
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:30,890
Rym: so I plug it in and it's simple.

70
00:04:31,193 --> 00:04:32,449
Scott: So I look no help for you.

71
00:04:32,831 --> 00:04:39,578
Rym: And of course the office manager like she set it up a hundred percent correctly and when she plugs it in it Blinks yellow, which means connecting.

72
00:04:40,221 --> 00:04:47,169
Rym: then it shows blue like connected to Wi-Fi And then she gets an email like it turned on and it shows a picture that it took right then.

73
00:04:48,132 --> 00:04:56,053
Rym: but then if she clicks on the video it times out and eventually the light on the camera just turns off and nothing and There's no logs.

74
00:04:56,274 --> 00:04:59,970
Rym: I even like plug the device into a computer and poked around like there's no logs anywhere.

75
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:02,067
Rym: The website just says your camera is not connected.

76
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:10,898
Rym: long story short it needs a bunch of specific ports open out to the internet and That's not documented fucking anywhere.

77
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:14,770
Scott: No, it probably just assumes you have like a UNP PNP or basic home router.

78
00:05:15,236 --> 00:05:16,310
Rym: Even with that like it doesn't work.

79
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:24,303
Rym: It needs like 13 like the RTMP port open to the outside and port 80 And some other things and it just doesn't fucking say anything.

80
00:05:24,564 --> 00:05:26,150
Rym: gives no way to troubleshoot this.

81
00:05:26,511 --> 00:05:29,183
Scott: I'm sure it says if you google it, so I plugged it.

82
00:05:29,243 --> 00:05:29,906
Rym: No, it doesn't.

83
00:05:30,007 --> 00:05:30,690
Rym: that's the problem.

84
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,955
Scott: I'm sure there's someone who wrote this.

85
00:05:32,136 --> 00:05:40,850
Rym: I found a few blogs of people but the official drop cam website Basically doesn't actually give you any as the kind of thing that would be in the drop cam forum on the support forum on their.

86
00:05:41,252 --> 00:05:42,276
Rym: Yeah, you know how I found it.

87
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:49,303
Rym: someone was complaining saying that they should be able to configure the ports They should but they didn't say what ports it starts on by default.

88
00:05:49,443 --> 00:05:50,588
Rym: I just had to assume it.

89
00:05:50,788 --> 00:05:51,089
Rym: Mmm.

90
00:05:51,692 --> 00:06:02,140
Rym: So knowing what I know I got it all set up and got it working and then I had some other issues where occasionally It'll just turn off and not turn back on Mmm, so I opened a support ticket with drop cam.

91
00:06:02,421 --> 00:06:03,466
Rym: They have yet to respond.

92
00:06:03,486 --> 00:06:03,968
Rym: Mm-hmm.

93
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:06,016
Rym: They They're not.

94
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,770
Rym: I don't think they have that many employees.

95
00:06:08,571 --> 00:06:12,480
Rym: They're still not fully integrated into nest because nest bought them and Google bought nest.

96
00:06:13,062 --> 00:06:14,485
Rym: so the hard.

97
00:06:14,525 --> 00:06:15,207
Rym: it's like GoPro.

98
00:06:15,247 --> 00:06:20,344
Rym: the hardware is great But at the same time the interface to that hardware is kind of.

99
00:06:20,404 --> 00:06:21,771
Scott: but well It's.

100
00:06:21,932 --> 00:06:24,790
Scott: you know, that's what happens when you try to buy simple stuff and not pro stuff.

101
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,181
Scott: Yes, we're too used to pro stuff and semi pro stuff.

102
00:06:27,562 --> 00:06:30,790
Rym: I know I mean, I'm looking right now at the Mackie We use for like GeekNights.

103
00:06:31,071 --> 00:06:37,795
Rym: I'm thinking back to like what if we tried to do GeekNights now with the not professional equipment We had before and I would just quit.

104
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:39,881
Rym: I was like not do GeekNights anymore.

105
00:06:39,901 --> 00:06:47,930
Scott: All right, so in somewhat tech news Alright, the only thing I could find anything to say about Amazon opened up a new store today.

106
00:06:48,213 --> 00:06:49,410
Scott: It's actually just part of Amazon.

107
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:57,004
Scott: I don't know what they call it like a store, but it's really just a section of the amazon.com For 3d printing and it sells 3d printing supplies.

108
00:06:57,204 --> 00:07:01,481
Scott: books about 3d printing Smart move plastic that you can use.

109
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:02,325
Rym: it's not the maker.

110
00:07:02,345 --> 00:07:03,510
Rym: ferret for 3d printing is big.

111
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,859
Rym: I mean how many people are kick-starting.

112
00:07:05,222 --> 00:07:06,390
Rym: I'm making a 3d printer.

113
00:07:06,912 --> 00:07:09,482
Rym: That's the same as all the other 3d printers, but crooks slightly.

114
00:07:09,502 --> 00:07:11,489
Scott: so right you can actually buy 3d printers, too.

115
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:15,548
Scott: But the one thing that they're selling that's interesting is actual things that are 3d printed now.

116
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:24,038
Scott: They're not competing directly so much with shape ways where you send shape ways that your model and then you know Your digital file and then they print it and send it to you.

117
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:28,441
Scott: What they're doing is they sort of have like these pre Done models.

118
00:07:28,844 --> 00:07:45,152
Scott: so for example Create your own 3d printed Mixi for 30 bucks and what you do is it's like it's almost like you make a me using this little interface in when you check out and like you can choose the hair and the color in the face and whatever and Then they print.

119
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:52,208
Scott: so it's sort of like you can slightly customize this 3d printed model And then they print it out and send it to you.

120
00:07:52,614 --> 00:07:53,370
Rym: That's a pretty good idea.

121
00:07:53,953 --> 00:07:57,290
Scott: So you don't have to know any 3d modeling and you can get some personalization.

122
00:07:57,491 --> 00:08:00,341
Rym: Emily even had that idea like way back when ponies were things she was like.

123
00:08:00,361 --> 00:08:13,530
Rym: I'm not gonna do this because you know shit talking But it'd be trivial to make like a bunch of pretty generic But very high quality pony models and then let people customize the parameters that are trivially customized and print their things for them.

124
00:08:13,851 --> 00:08:16,910
Scott: I mean this you know Hasbro just went to a partnership with shape ways.

125
00:08:17,651 --> 00:08:19,055
Scott: Right yeah, and they're actually.

126
00:08:19,076 --> 00:08:23,250
Scott: you can go to the take an official pony printing site and do similar thing.

127
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,294
Scott: They're like.

128
00:08:24,355 --> 00:08:25,600
Scott: it's actually an official partnership.

129
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,062
Scott: I think it's good.

130
00:08:26,082 --> 00:08:29,783
Scott: shape way saw how many people were printing ponies Yeah, and they must have contacted Hasbro.

131
00:08:29,803 --> 00:08:36,350
Rym: the deal Hasbro was way the fuck behind the curve on making merchandise And we talked about that on other shows.

132
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:41,210
Scott: But well we love fine seems to be scooping up all the money on companies that are way behind on making merchandise.

133
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:43,240
Rym: Yeah, we love vines a brilliant business model.

134
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,090
Scott: It's almost like just don't like any of their products.

135
00:08:45,251 --> 00:08:46,034
Scott: They're tacky as fuck.

136
00:08:46,054 --> 00:08:46,756
Rym: You know what they are.

137
00:08:46,837 --> 00:08:50,210
Rym: they're the square print silkscreen red dragon shirt.

138
00:08:50,391 --> 00:08:51,416
Rym: That's what they are.

139
00:08:51,436 --> 00:08:53,446
Rym: square print Twilight Sparkle.

140
00:08:53,466 --> 00:09:03,260
Rym: yep But the ponies themselves at least like the model is a pretty simple model and doesn't have the kinds of things that Make it difficult to print like a lot of.

141
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,049
Rym: like anime characters might have a unicorn horn.

142
00:09:05,732 --> 00:09:09,069
Rym: Yeah, you know what's hard to print tall things with thin legs.

143
00:09:11,472 --> 00:09:14,690
Rym: You know it's easy to print squat things with big old blob legs.

144
00:09:16,111 --> 00:09:22,910
Scott: You could just print the thing the tall skinny thing really big yeah, but even then it's gonna have issues sure.

145
00:09:24,076 --> 00:09:29,866
Rym: Anyway, I mean Unless you put like polonium in the feet you can't make a Sailor Moon crystal model.

146
00:09:29,926 --> 00:09:31,170
Rym: It'll stand under its own power.

147
00:09:31,231 --> 00:09:32,242
Rym: I don't think crystal.

148
00:09:32,282 --> 00:09:39,996
Scott: no You can make a Luna model yeah, or you can make a But a wand.

149
00:09:40,257 --> 00:09:42,850
Rym: so I think this story a wand in quotes.

150
00:09:43,051 --> 00:09:49,600
Rym: So this story does tell us one thing that we've been saying a lot 3d tech like the 3d printing stuff like people kind of poo-poo.

151
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,567
Rym: it is like this really like early hobby thing.

152
00:09:51,908 --> 00:09:58,070
Rym: once again It is moving way faster than almost everyone thinks it is a 3d printing.

153
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,099
Scott: It's like you look at oculus rift, and I'm like.

154
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:06,611
Scott: I don't think in any time soon It's gonna be small convenient or cheap enough for everyone to be using that Etc.

155
00:10:06,712 --> 00:10:10,990
Rym: yeah like people are into it will use it nerds for it will use it same with Google Glass.

156
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:15,281
Scott: But the 3d printing that's already a thing right.

157
00:10:15,321 --> 00:10:19,977
Scott: I mean originally 2d printing was a thing that you couldn't do unless you went to A printing press and 3d.

158
00:10:20,017 --> 00:10:27,856
Rym: I remember when I'm binkos opened up near my house Jesus Christ and like some majorly rich person might have a printer I went to that.

159
00:10:27,896 --> 00:10:28,439
Rym: kinkos.

160
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:32,356
Rym: like the week it opened with Machine was a big deal.

161
00:10:32,397 --> 00:10:33,059
Scott: you had to go.

162
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:34,766
Scott: It's like the library, and they had one.

163
00:10:34,786 --> 00:10:35,690
Scott: you put quarters in it.

164
00:10:35,951 --> 00:10:42,246
Rym: I remember printing copy photocopies of pages from my Dungeons & Dragons books and that was goddamn magic.

165
00:10:42,427 --> 00:10:42,748
Scott: right.

166
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:44,694
Scott: and now You can just print.

167
00:10:44,775 --> 00:10:47,928
Scott: I can rent fucking photos which the the for like 30 cents.

168
00:10:48,431 --> 00:10:50,404
Rym: Yeah, drug store used to have to do and Scott was 24 hours.

169
00:10:51,390 --> 00:11:03,950
Rym: I was printing ultra high-resolution glossy photos on photo paper at our booth at Connecticut with no, and I didn't even need power outlets though I used them because I can use them and you were just sending the photos to that thing wirelessly wireless.

170
00:11:04,132 --> 00:11:13,030
Scott: I took a photo in the camera wirelessly send it to the iPad where I Photoshopped it and then wirelessly sent it to a printer that could have been battery powered which then print.

171
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:13,352
Rym: It's got.

172
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:14,883
Rym: think about this when we were kids.

173
00:11:14,903 --> 00:11:19,177
Rym: You know what didn't exist wireless anything about CB radios.

174
00:11:19,518 --> 00:11:21,443
Rym: a computer powerful enough to do any of that.

175
00:11:21,744 --> 00:11:24,792
Rym: printing on paper printing in color Right.

176
00:11:24,812 --> 00:11:26,578
Scott: so 3d printing is gonna be just.

177
00:11:26,698 --> 00:11:29,647
Scott: you know it's gonna be just like 2d printing is.

178
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:32,017
Scott: yeah I just think the thing is.

179
00:11:32,037 --> 00:11:34,630
Scott: 2d printing is something that died.

180
00:11:35,022 --> 00:11:38,425
Scott: No It's something that like a lot of people sort of generally needed.

181
00:11:38,928 --> 00:11:40,557
Scott: right like Everyone needed it.

182
00:11:40,758 --> 00:11:42,710
Scott: if you had a computer you sort of needed a printer.

183
00:11:43,212 --> 00:11:44,799
Scott: You know cuz like you would off with.

184
00:11:44,859 --> 00:11:49,880
Scott: you know especially pre-internet you would type a letter But then you couldn't internet it to anyone's.

185
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,470
Scott: you had to print it and mail it or print it and hand it into the teacher.

186
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:59,229
Scott: And even today, you know if you're in school or even in a business you still need to print out documents, right?

187
00:11:59,973 --> 00:12:02,527
Scott: I think people print way more documents than they really have to.

188
00:12:02,547 --> 00:12:04,937
Rym: oh my god Don't get me started by about any developer.

189
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:08,349
Scott: probably like one in 50 documents actually needs to be printed.

190
00:12:09,232 --> 00:12:14,570
Scott: that's a conservative estimate, but There are occasions where you still need to print out documents.

191
00:12:14,613 --> 00:12:22,435
Rym: Yeah Anytime developers asked me a question about a spec and I walk over and they show me the section they have a question on because They print it out like the whole confluence page.

192
00:12:22,937 --> 00:12:23,618
Rym: I'm like guy.

193
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:27,408
Rym: I've updated that page like 40 times in the last month.

194
00:12:27,609 --> 00:12:33,590
Scott: Yep Yep But yeah 3d printing is not every something everyone will need to have in their home.

195
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,948
Scott: But you know cuz like a lot of people might just never need to print a 3d thing.

196
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:37,632
Rym: Of course.

197
00:12:37,712 --> 00:12:42,484
Rym: at the same time I could argue that the same thing was said of printing on paper for a time.

198
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:47,242
Scott: Mmm, I mean like what would my parents ever need to print in 3d?

199
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,970
Rym: So imagine well, let's skip the far future.

200
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:53,323
Rym: We're duh, like you're printing like everything right when you're printing food.

201
00:12:53,383 --> 00:12:53,664
Scott: Sure.

202
00:12:53,704 --> 00:12:54,266
Scott: We're skipping that.

203
00:12:54,286 --> 00:12:55,250
Scott: we're talking about the plastic.

204
00:12:55,772 --> 00:12:59,590
Rym: The next level is gonna be where every hobbyist who has a physical hobby will have one.

205
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:06,290
Rym: Absolutely, because that's when you're like you're making a Gundam model and you break something like up better But another one for not a policeman partner exactly.

206
00:13:07,131 --> 00:13:10,649
Rym: So I think it'll just it'll pull it but almost everyone.

207
00:13:11,338 --> 00:13:12,049
Rym: Who's a human?

208
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:13,453
Scott: Who is every?

209
00:13:13,594 --> 00:13:17,890
Scott: every nerd and art person will will need will want one even whether they can afford one or not.

210
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:20,189
Scott: But it'll get cheaper - it'll be like 200 bucks like a desk yet.

211
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:27,530
Rym: So my hope is that everyone in the industrialized world who's otherwise mostly achieved Maslow's pyramid like you have food.

212
00:13:27,853 --> 00:13:29,230
Rym: You're not living in a crippling poverty.

213
00:13:29,671 --> 00:13:35,787
Rym: You're gonna have some hobby that involves physical components of some kind and I think that will like that level.

214
00:13:35,887 --> 00:13:47,728
Rym: once printers get That reliable when there is reliable and probably still as expensive as an inkjet printer I think you're gonna see we're like 60 70 percent of internet at households will have one within 30 years.

215
00:13:48,371 --> 00:13:50,483
Rym: Maybe I'm really like.

216
00:13:50,503 --> 00:13:52,031
Rym: I'm not sure I'm not married to that I'm just.

217
00:13:52,051 --> 00:13:58,882
Scott: but I mean like how even if you have a use for one if you don't use it that often you're probably better Off just having someone else print your 3d

218
00:13:58,902 --> 00:14:01,536
Rym: things, but that's another interesting trend We're seeing is that like

219
00:14:01,637 --> 00:14:02,502
Scott: Amazon store this

220
00:14:02,522 --> 00:14:10,921
Rym: kind of an aside, but young people I mean all the car companies and they're still going crazy about this if you pay attention to like mainstream media They're like Millennials aren't buying cars.

221
00:14:10,961 --> 00:14:14,990
Rym: They're all trying to figure out like why Don't live in stupid suburbs like dumbasses.

222
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:29,070
Rym: Yep But part of it too is that young people who live in cities in my opinion are way more willing to share Things that require a lot of capital investment with other people in their demographic or even just other people.

223
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:34,530
Rym: I mean most people who live in New York can't afford to have their own rec room with a pool table in it.

224
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,152
Rym: So guess what?

225
00:14:35,473 --> 00:14:39,787
Rym: There's a whole bunch of pool halls that you can play pool and instead it's just.

226
00:14:39,888 --> 00:14:43,609
Scott: that's just cities Period so but in the suburbs.

227
00:14:44,132 --> 00:14:47,990
Rym: So cars are the same way now in the sense that a lot of people are willing to share cars.

228
00:14:48,572 --> 00:14:52,150
Rym: Use their friends cars or use things like zipcon and taxis.

229
00:14:52,331 --> 00:14:56,710
Scott: But again, oh, he's drive that you don't go anywhere and you just stay home and internet.

230
00:14:57,032 --> 00:14:59,810
Rym: So 3d printers are again the same way.

231
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:08,688
Rym: I know enough people who have 3d printers to where if I want to print anything 3d I can ask a whole bunch of different friends or go to this Amazon store or go shape ways.

232
00:15:08,929 --> 00:15:19,239
Rym: Yeah So, maybe we won't need them all in all of our houses because so enough of the people in this young tech demographic will have Them to where everyone has one.

233
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:26,810
Rym: It's like even if you don't even if not everyone we know has a smartphone Everyone we know is almost always in the presence of someone they know who has a smartphone.

234
00:15:28,712 --> 00:15:36,890
Rym: So in other news, this is kind of amazing a New virus was discovered the kind that hurts people of now hurts computers.

235
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,209
Rym: We're not sure what it does compete people people virus.

236
00:15:39,711 --> 00:15:43,404
Rym: It hurts individual cells arguably, but you know a lot of viruses are pretty benign.

237
00:15:43,806 --> 00:15:44,950
Rym: This one's the bacteriophage.

238
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:48,790
Rym: Okay, you know your guy kills all the bacteria not necessarily, you know.

239
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:53,570
Rym: You know the guy in every biology textbook in the world goes in the bacteria who multiplies.

240
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,702
Scott: He looks like an octagon with a little bug behind him.

241
00:15:55,763 --> 00:15:55,964
Scott: Yes.

242
00:15:56,004 --> 00:16:01,770
Scott: He looks like the little bug Yeah with a little and then he explodes the bacteria in it or the cell and a million little viruses come out.

243
00:16:02,031 --> 00:16:03,236
Rym: So well, they don't always explode.

244
00:16:03,257 --> 00:16:03,678
Rym: There's other.

245
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,065
Rym: they can all work in different ways.

246
00:16:05,206 --> 00:16:05,527
Rym: Sure.

247
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:16,697
Rym: So I knew one of those was discovered and apparently it is infected possibly the vast majority of all humans and has been Present for a long time.

248
00:16:16,717 --> 00:16:19,025
Rym: Okay, and yet somehow we never noticed it.

249
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:20,250
Scott: Well, it's really fucking small.

250
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:24,830
Rym: So yeah So there's this whole story that and if it's not like a high quantity in your body.

251
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:32,923
Rym: It's sort of a newly discovered virus has been found by a San Diego State University team to live inside more than half of all Human gut cells sampled.

252
00:16:33,286 --> 00:16:36,918
Rym: Yep There's a cool complicated story of how they found it.

253
00:16:37,319 --> 00:16:40,109
Rym: they're trying to figure out what it does all sorts of things about it.

254
00:16:40,513 --> 00:16:45,865
Rym: there's the article talks a lot about Why it was so hard to find it and it looks like every other kind of virus.

255
00:16:45,886 --> 00:16:47,693
Scott: you pass right over it when you're looking In the microscope.

256
00:16:47,734 --> 00:16:48,879
Rym: It's a little more complicated than that.

257
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:50,508
Scott: We don't sample a lot of gut cells.

258
00:16:50,528 --> 00:16:51,692
Rym: people One.

259
00:16:51,713 --> 00:16:56,168
Rym: they sample gut cells via fecal matter primarily or as the scientists who wrote this article said poo.

260
00:16:56,589 --> 00:16:57,695
Rym: Sure He's like poo.

261
00:16:57,715 --> 00:16:58,700
Rym: He just calls it poo.

262
00:16:58,761 --> 00:16:59,203
Scott: There you go.

263
00:16:59,223 --> 00:17:05,021
Rym: So Remember things that we think about as common knowledge.

264
00:17:05,423 --> 00:17:11,343
Rym: a lot of those things were not discovered But relatively recently case in point vitamins go.

265
00:17:11,403 --> 00:17:13,470
Rym: look up when different vitamins were discovered.

266
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:16,122
Rym: We have not known about vitamins for that long guys.

267
00:17:16,142 --> 00:17:17,869
Scott: Flintstones vitamins, right?

268
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,773
Scott: You know why they're Flintstones vitamins?

269
00:17:19,794 --> 00:17:28,154
Scott: because we discovered that shit and we started selling them when the Flintstones were hot when Flintstones hot 70s 60s and 70s.

270
00:17:28,273 --> 00:17:33,210
Rym: This is the second time you've brought up Flintstones in a casual conversation by a tangent.

271
00:17:33,411 --> 00:17:33,893
Rym: It's the.

272
00:17:33,974 --> 00:17:35,662
Scott: it's what's it called if we ever done.

273
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,190
Rym: is the bear shitting in the woods syndrome?

274
00:17:37,772 --> 00:17:38,595
Scott: No, that's what.

275
00:17:38,636 --> 00:17:42,170
Scott: no, that's what I call that thing where you see the same like word being used.

276
00:17:42,331 --> 00:17:44,520
Rym: Yes, I call that bear shitting in the woods.

277
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,750
Scott: Why is it bear shitting in the woods in George Carlin?

278
00:17:48,071 --> 00:17:51,630
Scott: I'd ever heard that bit anyway, I'm gonna go find it on YouTube after this anyway.

279
00:17:52,454 --> 00:17:58,680
Rym: So, yeah vitamins were discovered relatively recently and The whole reason I'm bringing this up is one.

280
00:17:58,781 --> 00:17:59,946
Rym: It's real science news.

281
00:18:00,027 --> 00:18:00,710
Rym: It's interesting.

282
00:18:01,071 --> 00:18:09,880
Rym: Some research might come out of this but most importantly the virus has the best name I have ever heard for a virus ever.

283
00:18:10,703 --> 00:18:12,490
Rym: It is called the ass phage.

284
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,199
Scott: Oh my god, cr.

285
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:21,408
Rym: It's crass phage, but capital CR Lower case capital a s capital a s s ph a GE.

286
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:22,471
Scott: There you go.

287
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:28,419
Scott: It is the ass phage virus and this crass is also a great word the crass and crass phage.

288
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:32,798
Rym: the ass phage Slash shot is mostly focusing on the name.

289
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:33,941
Scott: Why wouldn't you?

290
00:18:34,102 --> 00:18:35,366
Scott: what else is there to focus on?

291
00:18:35,687 --> 00:18:53,695
Rym: and here's a comment I am the last author on the paper Mmm, and it was discovered by my bioinformatics lab in the CS department at SDS you it was named after our analysis software CR uppercase a SS cross assembly because they're Investigating poo.

292
00:18:54,338 --> 00:18:57,049
Scott: So that's why they named it that way because their software is about poo.

293
00:18:57,491 --> 00:19:00,629
Rym: So thus they decided to go all out on that kind of like out IBM.

294
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,416
Rym: We had a huge server we were building.

295
00:19:02,436 --> 00:19:06,530
Rym: that was just a data store like hundreds of terrible ridiculous storage server.

296
00:19:06,872 --> 00:19:08,023
Rym: so we're like, what should we call it?

297
00:19:08,668 --> 00:19:13,610
Rym: and We came up on the BMFS which stood for officially big motherfucking server.

298
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,059
Rym: But we came up with some other reason.

299
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:16,770
Rym: that acronym was there so we wouldn't get in trouble.

300
00:19:18,052 --> 00:19:21,109
Rym: But I present for your consideration the ass phage.

301
00:19:27,502 --> 00:19:29,999
Rym: but anyway things of the day.

302
00:19:30,882 --> 00:19:37,500
Rym: You all may or may not be familiar with the music video to a song entitled turned down for what what what?

303
00:19:39,743 --> 00:19:42,279
Rym: The music video is pretty special in its own way.

304
00:19:42,702 --> 00:19:44,860
Rym: It's the most special but that's not my thing of the day.

305
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,558
Rym: I'll link to it because you really should see what it is.

306
00:19:47,985 --> 00:19:52,056
Scott: Possibly You can handle it if you can handle it.

307
00:19:52,076 --> 00:19:52,679
Scott: You should watch it.

308
00:19:53,081 --> 00:19:53,984
Rym: So it's it's.

309
00:19:54,064 --> 00:19:54,185
Rym: it's.

310
00:19:54,405 --> 00:19:55,790
Scott: a lot of people can't handle it.

311
00:19:56,131 --> 00:19:58,560
Rym: It's pretty turned down pretty unhandleable.

312
00:19:58,963 --> 00:20:00,478
Scott: I don't know it for what but what?

313
00:20:02,081 --> 00:20:06,419
Rym: Our whole thing over the weekend with when we had friends over was the Skeletor?

314
00:20:06,479 --> 00:20:06,640
Rym: what?

315
00:20:07,821 --> 00:20:08,444
Rym: So unrelated.

316
00:20:08,785 --> 00:20:12,179
Rym: Oh, I could mash those up pretty well turned down for what what what?

317
00:20:13,801 --> 00:20:20,000
Rym: So this is that music video but the music has been removed and they have foleyed in all the.

318
00:20:20,301 --> 00:20:21,425
Scott: What is this foley?

319
00:20:21,466 --> 00:20:21,727
Scott: I don't know.

320
00:20:21,747 --> 00:20:22,711
Scott: you give using that word.

321
00:20:22,811 --> 00:20:24,056
Scott: I don't know where that word came from.

322
00:20:24,096 --> 00:20:24,859
Rym: really, okay.

323
00:20:25,181 --> 00:20:33,377
Rym: So, you know in a movie when like you see a dog run by like in a house Like just this dog in a house running by and you hear like their nails like running by on the hardwood.

324
00:20:33,638 --> 00:20:39,170
Scott: Mm-hmm That doesn't get recorded When they're filming it obviously, but why would it be called foley?

325
00:20:39,331 --> 00:20:40,696
Rym: Oh Lee is what that's called foley.

326
00:20:40,716 --> 00:20:41,960
Scott: It's called dubbing.

327
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,866
Rym: No, dubbing is the voices.

328
00:20:43,987 --> 00:20:53,285
Rym: foley is when you recreate in a sound studio Individual sounds or like sound effects to go along with a movie Sound effects.

329
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:54,549
Rym: No, that's called foley.

330
00:20:54,709 --> 00:20:55,190
Scott: Okay.

331
00:20:55,752 --> 00:20:57,397
Rym: Should I link to you to an article on foley?

332
00:20:57,417 --> 00:21:00,820
Scott: I don't disbelieve you I just I just didn't know there was a special word.

333
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:05,800
Rym: Foley is the reproduction of everyday sound effects that are added to film video and other media in post-production to enhance audio quality.

334
00:21:05,921 --> 00:21:06,787
Scott: I didn't disbelieve you.

335
00:21:06,827 --> 00:21:11,047
Scott: I just said that's a word I hadn't heard You just say put in sound effects.

336
00:21:11,248 --> 00:21:15,721
Rym: putting in sound effects is where you take an existing sound effects library and add sound effects to Something.

337
00:21:16,062 --> 00:21:26,678
Rym: foley is when you take like a melon and then you put like a knife in your fist and you stab it And then you you and you stab it along with the movie to make the sound of stabbing.

338
00:21:28,082 --> 00:21:29,349
Scott: Just making sound effects.

339
00:21:29,409 --> 00:21:40,763
Rym: Yes making sound effects for movies Okay Especially adding in like the little background clicks and things like when people bump into each other someone gets hit someone drops a phone book Like the.

340
00:21:40,783 --> 00:21:43,252
Rym: did you ever read on how they made the lightsaber sounds in Star Wars?

341
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:44,818
Scott: electric razor in a metal bowl?

342
00:21:44,899 --> 00:21:45,806
Rym: exactly That's foley.

343
00:21:46,251 --> 00:21:49,987
Scott: Okay Who doesn't know that tonight?

344
00:21:50,007 --> 00:21:55,350
Scott: if you didn't know that and you had to and you were surprised by my answer Well, you're not a real geek.

345
00:21:55,995 --> 00:21:59,931
Scott: Take that Regardless of gender it could have been.

346
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:01,217
Rym: I was about to make a geeks.

347
00:22:01,257 --> 00:22:01,940
Scott: Listen to GeekNights.

348
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:03,450
Rym: I was about to make a really inside joke.

349
00:22:03,511 --> 00:22:03,853
Rym: Wow.

350
00:22:03,994 --> 00:22:04,477
Rym: He's good.

351
00:22:08,472 --> 00:22:16,899
Rym: Anyway This music video with no music and with just really well foley didn't sound effects is basically a horror movie.

352
00:22:18,082 --> 00:22:19,487
Rym: It is horrific to behold.

353
00:22:19,507 --> 00:22:21,213
Scott: That's it was a horror movie to begin with.

365
00:22:43,825 --> 00:22:44,734
Scott: It's not the dry heat.

366
00:22:44,754 --> 00:22:46,222
Scott: That's the problem It's the food supply.

374
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,127

00:23:12,428 --> 00:23:13,572
Rym: What about Dantooine?

376
00:23:13,612 --> 00:23:14,675

Scott: my brother had ice planet Legos, but they were not hot ice planet.

385
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,170
Scott: But now they actually have hot Legos.

386
00:23:41,251 --> 00:23:41,753
Scott: Yep.

387
00:23:41,773 --> 00:23:43,260
Rym: You know what they actually worked in the snow.

388
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,680
Rym: Do you know how many Legos I'd lose every winter in the front yard and then find in the spring?

389
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:50,231
Scott: I'll never bring it never have a pool and bring your boat Legos in there.

390
00:23:50,392 --> 00:23:52,740
Rym: Yeah, most of those ended up in the pool filter.

391
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:57,880
Rym: Yeah, they go and then they're all bleached out from the chlorine and disgusting.

392
00:23:59,722 --> 00:24:03,020
Rym: Yep, yep in the meta moment the book club book is a canticle for Liebowitz.

393
00:24:03,763 --> 00:24:06,635
Rym: I'm only on my fifth novel since I finished it waiting for Scott.

394
00:24:06,655 --> 00:24:07,860
Scott: When do you read these novels?

395
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,085
Rym: I guess I read faster than you.

396
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:10,526
Scott: I don't know.

397
00:24:10,547 --> 00:24:12,574
Scott: It just went like I read really fast.

398
00:24:12,755 --> 00:24:15,666
Scott: if I read on the subway I'm not on the subway.

399
00:24:15,706 --> 00:24:17,513
Scott: I'm biking every day occasionally.

400
00:24:17,574 --> 00:24:19,180
Rym: I subway like if it's raining.

401
00:24:20,341 --> 00:24:26,840
Scott: Okay, but if I occasional subway, I have to hack all the portals and I don't read on the most of my subways underground.

402
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:27,803
Rym: So I don't hack any portals.

403
00:24:27,843 --> 00:24:29,407
Scott: most of my subways above ground.

404
00:24:29,428 --> 00:24:30,370
Rym: Let's read books.

405
00:24:30,972 --> 00:24:31,493
Rym: Also, I fly.

406
00:24:31,514 --> 00:24:33,720
Scott: the underground part is like five minutes.

407
00:24:34,142 --> 00:24:36,835
Rym: I also actually read when I'm laying in bed before I go to bed.

408
00:24:36,855 --> 00:24:43,790
Rym: I Read the internet and sometimes I read while I'm cooking Video game if it's fairly low impact cooking.

409
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:46,919
Rym: I did not read during those times if it's not that interactive in the cooking.

410
00:24:48,983 --> 00:24:50,819
Rym: So, yeah, we got a bunch of videos up.

411
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,005
Rym: We were streaming a lot more.

412
00:24:52,065 --> 00:24:55,720
Rym: so follow both of us on Twitch because now the kinetic ons passed.

413
00:24:56,204 --> 00:24:58,240
Rym: We have no conventions until packs.

414
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:02,725
Scott: Mmm, speaking of packs Huge metamoment news.

415
00:25:02,785 --> 00:25:05,594
Rym: Yeah, the biggest metamoment news we've ever had you've ever.

416
00:25:05,614 --> 00:25:08,324
Scott: so if you usually skip the metamoment You just fucked up.

417
00:25:08,665 --> 00:25:09,549
Scott: You fucked the fuck up.

418
00:25:09,589 --> 00:25:15,914
Scott: So fucked up just in case we were worried We might not get a panel at PAX Prime this year because that shit keeps getting bigger.

419
00:25:15,934 --> 00:25:17,560
Scott: Oh, you're not getting any bigger.

420
00:25:18,163 --> 00:25:19,390
Scott: We're sort of the same size.

421
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:21,060
Rym: Yep, and wall packs have been very good to us.

422
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,526
Rym: I mean we've performed it literally.

423
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:25,741
Rym: love you packs without exception since 2008.

424
00:25:25,741 --> 00:25:32,380
Scott: I will continue to kiss your ass But because I want to not because I'm getting a reward out of it because your ass tastes so good.

425
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:38,139
Rym: We flew to Australia to do a panel at a PAX on purpose because we wanted to.

426
00:25:38,259 --> 00:25:40,217
Rym: yes They didn't pay us to do that, right?

427
00:25:41,181 --> 00:25:47,610
Scott: Anyway, but I don't want to I don't want to assume but we were worried, you know Just in case maybe we wouldn't get a panel at.

428
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:50,280
Scott: PAX is here because it's bigger and badder and awesomer.

429
00:25:50,521 --> 00:25:53,820
Scott: So I bought some tickets to PAX and cuz I'm good at internetting.

430
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,651
Scott: I got four four weekend passes.

431
00:25:56,712 --> 00:26:05,520
Rym: now if you want to know how hard it is to get these passes I want to point out that Scott and I Noticed badges went on sale and entered the queue at roughly the silk within the same minute.

432
00:26:06,621 --> 00:26:13,997
Rym: Definitely Scott got four day badges the maximum you can get four for four day badge And it was sold out by the time I got through the queue.

433
00:26:14,017 --> 00:26:14,460
Rym: That's right.

434
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:19,353
Scott: So I bought the four four day badges and our panel was accepted.

435
00:26:19,433 --> 00:26:22,945
Scott: so we don't need any of them But Emily needs one.

436
00:26:22,965 --> 00:26:23,709
Scott: So Emily gets one.

437
00:26:23,889 --> 00:26:25,960
Scott: Yes, and then they cost a lot of fucking money.

438
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,450
Scott: They're like a hundred and ten dollars each.

439
00:26:27,793 --> 00:26:28,759
Scott: So I don't care if you hate me.

440
00:26:29,081 --> 00:26:31,491
Scott: I got to sell at least one of these fuckers to get some money back.

441
00:26:31,511 --> 00:26:32,636
Scott: cuz yeah, I have money.

442
00:26:32,656 --> 00:26:34,186
Scott: that's $440.

443
00:26:34,186 --> 00:26:58,315
Scott: that's a lot of fucking money I could have bought in a really fancy camera lens or all kinds of crazy shit with that money I don't buy but the other two We will sacrifice for you, maybe We're going to use them for self-promotion Advertising purposes because maybe you know, like I said GeekNights isn't getting any bigger But maybe with the injection of packs badges it can be.

444
00:26:58,335 --> 00:26:59,519
Scott: so here's what we're gonna do.

445
00:27:00,962 --> 00:27:05,580
Scott: We need you people who listen to GeekNights who want to go to packs, but don't have tickets.

446
00:27:06,581 --> 00:27:07,846
Scott: We're gonna do the same stupid thing.

447
00:27:07,886 --> 00:27:08,669
Scott: Everyone else does.

448
00:27:09,171 --> 00:27:13,345
Scott: we're gonna make a tweet, right and You can retweet it.

449
00:27:13,847 --> 00:27:17,240
Scott: or you can make a tweet to like your favorite GeekNights episode.

450
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:26,984
Scott: You know It has to link to us in some way to promote us and has to have hashtags of GeekNights and also the hashtag of packs two hashtags Right.

451
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:37,391
Scott: that way it'll get promoted when people search for packs related tweets And also people will know the name of GeekNights and also be linked to our shit Though you could even just link till.

452
00:27:37,451 --> 00:27:38,700
Scott: it doesn't have to be a GeekNights episode.

453
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,659
Scott: You could link to one of our YouTube videos.

454
00:27:41,081 --> 00:27:46,020
Scott: It is the link to some of our content in some way even a pecs panel and have those two hashtags.

455
00:27:46,442 --> 00:27:49,076
Scott: Or you can even be like at GeekNights hashtag packs.

456
00:27:49,116 --> 00:27:49,759
Scott: That's okay, too.

457
00:27:49,941 --> 00:27:52,060
Rym: Well, the I GeekNights can't be at the beginning of it, obviously.

458
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:57,580
Scott: Otherwise, we're not gonna guess and I don't know we might be able to add in G plus and Facebook.

459
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,503
Scott: The issue there is.

460
00:27:58,523 --> 00:28:02,337
Scott: we have to be able to find your message when we do a search, right?

461
00:28:02,358 --> 00:28:02,920
Rym: That's all you.

462
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:05,789
Scott: Twitter only I think for now Twitter only.

463
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:11,254
Scott: if I figure out how to search for like everyone who did this You know G plus or Facebook.

464
00:28:11,274 --> 00:28:12,200
Scott: we can do it there also.

465
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,304
Scott: but for now Twitter only.

466
00:28:14,148 --> 00:28:27,997
Scott: if you do that, we will randomly select someone and On the day, I receive the packs badges in the mail I don't know what day that's gonna be and Then I will immediately that day go to the post office and mail the two of them to that person if you

467
00:28:28,038 --> 00:28:28,640
Rym: wish if it

468

Scott: and getting their address for whatever.

471
00:28:32,772 --> 00:28:38,538
Scott: if you fail to direct message me back within like the 24 hours, I can pick someone else and that's how it's gonna go.

472
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:47,975
Rym: Yep on the off chance that for whatever reason we can't mail them to you because you're like you You know a person without an address or something weird we can give them to you at packs

00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:11,060
Scott: I promise you that you know you paying for your airfare and hotel, which we are not contributing to in any way shape or form.

492
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,567
Rym: Yes starting now stay.

493
00:29:40,587 --> 00:29:44,743
Scott: we're going to make a news post on our website with the full Instructions and rules.

494
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:49,379
Scott: I hope we don't get in trouble with some like state law about contests and prizes or anything like that.

495
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:52,150
Rym: Yep, basically for people listening.

496
00:29:52,491 --> 00:29:52,853
Rym: It'll be.

497
00:29:52,873 --> 00:29:54,158
Rym: you have to have hashtag.

498
00:29:54,178 --> 00:29:58,879
Rym: GeekNights Hashtag packs, they're separate hashtags You can also have at GeekNights.

499
00:29:59,211 --> 00:30:05,966
Scott: Yeah Can't be the first thing in your post because then no one will see it except us and it has to link to Something that we created.

500
00:30:06,126 --> 00:30:10,660
Scott: some of our content must be linked with a URL and it must be GeekNights content.

501
00:30:10,721 --> 00:30:22,900
Rym: If you link to like my personal blog Yeah, you can't link to one of my netrunner videos But it's okay to link to my rims YouTube account because that's basically the official GeekNights one and all our packs lectures are there.

502
00:30:23,725 --> 00:30:25,517
Scott: I guess you could link directly to the channel.

503
00:30:25,638 --> 00:30:27,285
Rym: Yeah Yeah, you could link to a geek.

504
00:30:27,306 --> 00:30:27,888
Scott: nice presents you.

505
00:30:27,928 --> 00:30:30,980
Scott: Tana has to be some sort of GeekNights content.

506
00:30:32,282 --> 00:30:33,474
Scott: Anyway, yeah, that's it.

507
00:30:33,777 --> 00:30:33,878
Scott: All

508
00:30:33,918 --> 00:30:39,214
Rym: right so Our friends had a baby and the babies a

509
00:30:39,575 --> 00:30:40,707
Scott: lot of friends who had babies Yep

510
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:49,339
Rym: But the one of them had one a while ago and this one's formed up to the point where still kind of preverbal like Talk, but it's that kind of not making sense talk.

511
00:30:50,242 --> 00:30:57,739
Rym: But what I'm gonna go what we noticed that was interesting was watching this kid because I've been very rarely around young children.

512
00:30:58,881 --> 00:30:59,463
Rym: What I am.

513
00:30:59,764 --> 00:31:00,927
Scott: that is for the better.

514
00:31:00,947 --> 00:31:04,458
Scott: our society's rules are functioning as design.

515
00:31:04,518 --> 00:31:06,588
Rym: Hey kid You want to learn the words?

516
00:31:06,629 --> 00:31:08,639
Rym: They're gonna make your mom flip the fuck out.

517
00:31:09,926 --> 00:31:10,979
Rym: They got a bit a little older for that.

518
00:31:11,521 --> 00:31:19,571
Scott: So I told him hey if you want to know anything about the history of your parents or anything about them Yep, you just find anyone named Scott.

519
00:31:19,692 --> 00:31:20,940
Scott: There's like two or three of us.

520
00:31:21,161 --> 00:31:26,097
Rym: We all knew your parents before they were dating each other both of them.

521
00:31:26,258 --> 00:31:26,820
Scott: That's right.

522
00:31:27,562 --> 00:31:29,229
Rym: So, uh what I noticed?

523
00:31:29,571 --> 00:31:31,197
Rym: because you know, they came over and seen him forever.

524
00:31:31,238 --> 00:31:33,164
Rym: They're in our apartment The kids running around up.

525
00:31:33,385 --> 00:31:37,820
Rym: His middle name is danger, which is like double awesome, but that's all before the opposite of awesome.

526
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,009
Scott: They'll find out when he goes to school whether that's awesome or not.

527
00:31:40,391 --> 00:31:41,355
Rym: I think it's pretty awesome.

528
00:31:41,857 --> 00:31:42,400
Rym: It's very much.

529
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:49,663
Scott: Yeah, you're not some student in school who may be positively or negatively Appreciating that.

530
00:31:49,683 --> 00:31:53,400
Rym: so I noticed something when he was running around our apartment doing his kid thing.

531
00:31:53,561 --> 00:32:06,343
Rym: he was a kid by all normal ways, but He went around seeking out anything that looked like electronics and the first thing he would do is try to interact with a Touchscreen on it

532
00:32:06,705 --> 00:32:07,608
Scott: or push buttons

533
00:32:07,748 --> 00:32:08,270
Rym: if there was no

534
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:10,840
Scott: wanted to push buttons and touch screens and look at screens.

535
00:32:10,941 --> 00:32:12,899
Rym: Yep, he would push the button and it wasn't just random.

536
00:32:13,241 --> 00:32:19,960
Rym: He if he was pushing buttons and it wasn't having any visible outward effect He'd figure out they were fake.

537
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:24,755
Rym: Like I gave him my controller like my big arcade stick and it wasn't plugged in anything.

538
00:32:25,237 --> 00:32:26,099
Rym: So he messes with it.

539
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:32,079
Rym: He loi why he immediately looks up the TV while he's messing with it realizes it's not actually plugged in and got mad at me.

540
00:32:33,121 --> 00:32:41,380
Scott: But then when he like if it got a reaction like once I gave him my GoPro and he pushed the button and he didn't Understand that it was a camera, but it beeped when you push the buttons.

541
00:32:41,704 --> 00:32:42,619
Scott: So he liked pushing those.

542
00:32:44,148 --> 00:32:51,639
Rym: But once he figured out how to turn off the TV He wanted nothing more than to make sure that TV was fucking off or on again.

543
00:32:52,202 --> 00:32:57,958
Rym: And the most beautiful thing though was we were you know, we had the Hgpc plugged in so we had it like a Windows desktop.

544
00:32:57,998 --> 00:32:59,974
Rym: on the TV There's a YouTube video that we had been playing.

545
00:33:00,035 --> 00:33:00,559
Rym: it was paused.

546
00:33:01,121 --> 00:33:08,100
Rym: The first thing he did when he saw the TV is ran over and hit the TV screen itself his finger.

547
00:33:08,464 --> 00:33:12,417
Rym: He hit the pause button Specifically to make it play again.

548
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:14,947
Rym: Now my TV is not a touchscreen.

549
00:33:14,967 --> 00:33:15,910
Rym: that obviously didn't work.

550
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:17,535
Rym: But think about this.

551
00:33:17,856 --> 00:33:24,499
Rym: a kid who's like a year old Already understands touchscreens more than most adult humans that I know.

552
00:33:26,122 --> 00:33:31,869
Rym: Kids growing up now are in some ways Fundamentally different from kids who grew up in earlier era.

553
00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:38,078
Scott: Yeah, I grew up with a keyboard and a gamepad So I fundamentally understand those things.

554
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:42,968
Rym: Yeah, I also know how to use a touchscreen Exactly, but I won.

555
00:33:43,028 --> 00:33:51,320
Rym: I'm starting to wonder more about what kids who were growing up now Like what they're gonna be like in terms of technology because I'm what I love is a technology issue.

556
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,279
Scott: This is more like a child psychology issue.

557
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:59,860
Rym: Ah, but the technology is allowing child interactions that in the history of humanity basically couldn't exist.

558
00:34:00,682 --> 00:34:08,780
Rym: Okay, like we're kids have access to the kinds of information environments that like it's almost unprecedented the interactivity that they can have.

559
00:34:09,121 --> 00:34:12,540
Scott: There's been something unprecedented in every era of child.

560
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:17,215
Scott: No one has raised children that grew up similar conditions that they grew up in.

561
00:34:17,335 --> 00:34:28,600
Rym: arguably there were multi-hundred-year spans throughout many of the great empires of history where Multiple generations in a row grew up under effectively identical cultural and political regimes.

562
00:34:29,061 --> 00:34:36,219
Rym: Those were dark ages and they were dark for a reason up also like during non dark ages like ancient Greece and places like that.

563
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,306
Rym: It's just a lot.

564
00:34:37,326 --> 00:34:44,179
Rym: of those societies were for long Like stretches in the micro were pretty static in terms of like child rearing.

565
00:34:44,962 --> 00:34:46,826
Scott: Okay, those are societies.

566
00:34:46,847 --> 00:34:47,408
Scott: No one living.

567
00:34:47,428 --> 00:34:48,690
Rym: Yeah, plus what about that?

568
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:56,280
Rym: I mean from Cro-Magnon to like the births of Civilizations and writing and agriculture and all that people raising kids.

569
00:34:56,521 --> 00:34:57,808
Rym: Nothing really changed much.

570
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:05,475
Rym: the rate of change of technology Relation to the span of human lifetime is accelerating and the rate of acceleration is itself accelerating.

571
00:35:05,836 --> 00:35:07,100
Rym: that rate by the way is called jerk.

572
00:35:09,002 --> 00:35:09,845
Scott: Why don't we just call it Rym?

573
00:35:09,865 --> 00:35:13,860
Rym: then I'm the acceleration of an acceleration that you're a jerk.

574
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:22,955
Rym: So I realized - looking back at me as a kid I mean I grew up without computers.

575
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:37,460
Rym: computers came After I was already like really sentient and already could do math and stuff Apple - in kindergarten and we didn't have our a 2600 and a video game before kindergarten and an NES in elementary school.

576
00:35:37,741 --> 00:35:40,529
Rym: I mean, I didn't have a cell phone until college.

577
00:35:41,251 --> 00:35:42,535
Scott: I didn't own one till college.

578
00:35:42,575 --> 00:35:44,180
Scott: My family had them when I was in high school.

579
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,046
Rym: Yep, my family also had them when I was in high school.

580
00:35:46,067 --> 00:35:48,555
Rym: I would occasionally borrow it up smartphones.

581
00:35:48,655 --> 00:35:51,887
Rym: I didn't have until like 2009.

582
00:35:51,887 --> 00:35:57,979
Scott: smartphones Existed when we were in late college because Steve Pomeroy had them.

583
00:35:58,481 --> 00:36:01,792
Scott: But I didn't have one until the day the iPhone.

584
00:36:01,852 --> 00:36:06,740
Scott: I didn't personally own what I had blackberries from the job I got as soon as I graduated college or just counted.

585
00:36:07,182 --> 00:36:10,476
Scott: But I didn't personally own one until the day the iPhone 3g came out.

586
00:36:10,536 --> 00:36:11,440
Scott: I was in line about it.

587
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:23,351
Rym: I was a functioning adult on my third for real career job when I first had in my possession a device That would show me a live map of where I was with GPS data.

588
00:36:23,852 --> 00:36:24,754
Scott: iPhone 3g do that.

589
00:36:24,894 --> 00:36:26,037
Rym: I didn't have an iPhone 3g.

590
00:36:26,057 --> 00:36:29,087
Rym: I Didn't say first thing that existed.

591
00:36:29,127 --> 00:36:30,313
Rym: I said I owned one.

592
00:36:30,333 --> 00:36:35,217
Scott: I mean you could have had the palm trio Yeah, I could have but I didn't or one of those windows CE phones.

593
00:36:35,358 --> 00:36:37,366
Rym: I bought a Symbian phone.

594
00:36:37,406 --> 00:36:40,316
Rym: I used my work blackberry for like six months and then I bought a palm pre.

595
00:36:40,356 --> 00:36:40,878
Rym: There you go.

596
00:36:41,621 --> 00:36:47,540
Rym: So I didn't grow up having a lot of like could directly always connected access to information.

597
00:36:47,942 --> 00:36:57,740
Rym: And when I think back at my life the way I interacted with the world was Fundamentally different from the way I interact with it now I mean I had to explore neighborhoods because there was no way for me to know what was around.

598
00:36:59,043 --> 00:37:00,199
Rym: What flipped through the yellow pages?

599
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,484
Rym: Go through a road atlas.

600
00:37:02,505 --> 00:37:04,031
Rym: There's like 15 years out of date.

601
00:37:04,453 --> 00:37:08,032
Scott: use triple-a because we're driving to Florida What I bring out a triptych when I go home.

602
00:37:08,093 --> 00:37:09,340
Rym: I got through the highlighter.

603
00:37:09,682 --> 00:37:13,183
Rym: Yeah, the guy would like print out maps and highlight your route for you And you know what.

604
00:37:13,263 --> 00:37:15,255
Rym: if something went wrong on that trip you were fucked.

605
00:37:15,456 --> 00:37:26,500
Rym: Mm-hmm In fact, uh, I remember in the old days I used my triple-a card which was long expired But the triple-a website only checked to see if the number was valid.

606
00:37:26,601 --> 00:37:28,958
Rym: It didn't check to see if the account was active to let you log in.

607
00:37:29,582 --> 00:37:38,098
Rym: So throughout all of our IT I could go generate trip ticks and I stopped doing that once Map quest and Google Maps we use my best because Google Maps did not yet exist.

608
00:37:38,841 --> 00:37:41,789
Scott: I'm used Yahoo Maps when map quest is giving shitty directions.

609
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:45,320
Scott: Yeah, and we kept using them because Google Maps version 1 was garbage.

610
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,940
Scott: And then Google Maps became good and all the other maps died.

611
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:57,172
Rym: But even then we would before a trip like someone's job was to figure out the route Print all the maps for the entire trip because we got on the road without those maps.

612
00:37:57,734 --> 00:38:00,160
Rym: Oh bad news at a convention.

613
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,213
Scott: So we're mostly just talking about olden days now and not talking about kids at all.

614
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:04,599
Rym: So think about kids now.

615
00:38:05,182 --> 00:38:06,186
Rym: It's a growing up one.

616
00:38:06,206 --> 00:38:16,499
Rym: So you agree they can look up Anything at any time all the time thus eliminating 90% of the conversations I had as a child.

617
00:38:17,802 --> 00:38:21,100
Rym: Like a kid like once it could get to the point where they start using technology.

618
00:38:21,743 --> 00:38:24,699
Rym: Why will the Kelvin's dad situation ever happen again?

619
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:31,362
Rym: Will a kid ever ask their parents how something works when they know that they can just type it into the internet and they'll get An answer?

620
00:38:31,662 --> 00:38:34,712
Scott: well kids in elementary school ever be like in Mortal Kombat.

621
00:38:34,732 --> 00:38:37,240
Scott: There's a secret you can get boo boo ballad.

622
00:38:37,981 --> 00:38:39,710
Rym: Yeah, you know who's gonna say that?

623
00:38:40,092 --> 00:38:41,399
Rym: I have a theory about what's gonna happen.

624
00:38:42,441 --> 00:38:44,066
Rym: the divide like we always talk about.

625
00:38:44,086 --> 00:38:49,523
Rym: the digital divide and how it's wide and how it's why than anyone realizes and way more important Than anyone realizes.

626
00:38:49,543 --> 00:38:51,308
Rym: I think it's even worse than that.

627
00:38:52,191 --> 00:39:16,820
Rym: I think because I've seen this already the children of People I have seen who themselves are not supercomputer are also not supercomputer Mm-hmm, but the children of people who are computer are so much more computer than even their parents already That I think that it's not like the computers and the internet and all this access is gonna democratize our culture.

628
00:39:17,382 --> 00:39:28,179
Rym: I think the divide between digital kids and not connected kids is gonna be so great that That is going to be the primary former of clicks in physical schools among young kids growing up.

629
00:39:28,661 --> 00:39:36,140
Scott: I'd see I mean I go to the mentoring and it's at a computer high school a public computer high school the Academy for software engineering.

630
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:41,508
Scott: yeah, and I go and I see these high school kids right and There are a few who are.

631
00:39:41,548 --> 00:39:42,775
Scott: those nerdy kids are coding.

632
00:39:42,795 --> 00:39:50,360
Scott: They're gonna be Steve Pomeroy But most of them Don't computer right even though they're out of computer school.

633
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,797
Scott: They can use a computer, but they don't understand how computer works.

634
00:39:54,918 --> 00:39:56,524
Scott: for reals They don't have.

635
00:39:56,544 --> 00:40:00,380
Scott: they did that instinct to Google everything, right?

636
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:04,216
Scott: It's like they're still reading like video game magazines from GameStop, right?

637
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:06,667
Scott: They don't read Polygon right.

638
00:40:06,687 --> 00:40:08,375
Scott: they don't know really what's going on.

639
00:40:08,837 --> 00:40:09,420
Scott: There's one kid.

640
00:40:10,022 --> 00:40:14,194
Scott: Metal Gear is his thing number one thing right of all his geekeries.

641
00:40:14,474 --> 00:40:16,400
Scott: for me Metal Gear is like man, right?

642
00:40:16,541 --> 00:40:17,668
Scott: Not into Metal Gear really.

643
00:40:17,829 --> 00:40:21,650
Scott: I like old Metal Gear, but I know Metal Gear, but I'm not super into it.

644
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:23,760
Scott: I can't get past like two rooms in Metal Gear solid.

645
00:40:24,403 --> 00:40:25,809
Rym: Right, I didn't like Metal Gear solid.

646
00:40:25,829 --> 00:40:28,139
Scott: I knew more about Metal Gear than this kid because I internet.

647
00:40:28,179 --> 00:40:29,821
Scott: I Mean.

648
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:30,143
Scott: he knew.

649
00:40:30,264 --> 00:40:37,322
Scott: he knew like all the Metal Gear games that existed He knew what you would know about Metal Gear if you went to GameStop and played every Metal Gear game and read video game Magazines.

650
00:40:37,703 --> 00:40:40,250
Scott: right, but I knew who Deo Kojima was and he doesn't.

651
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:43,600
Rym: so that's my question are his parents internet?

652
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,624
Rym: Do you have any way to know?

653
00:40:44,644 --> 00:40:44,664
Rym: I

654
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:45,568
Scott: don't know

655
00:40:46,030 --> 00:41:06,240
Rym: because I'm starting to think I'm worrying that When we like when I see kids that tends to be kids of internet people and those kids seem like like I see them on A path that could not have existed in the world I grew up in like though they're gonna grow up to be so much more reliant upon and connected to technology than I ever was.

656
00:41:06,823 --> 00:41:15,300
Rym: But at the same time when I interact with other kids I feel like they're less internet than kids who grew up in the era of no internet.

657
00:41:15,901 --> 00:41:18,849
Scott: It's also, you know the computers, you know, it's like we had were.

658
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:23,819
Scott: if we wanted to internet right we had to do the hard way right.

659
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,829
Scott: They just like Facebook whatever true.

660
00:41:27,869 --> 00:41:30,960
Scott: No, so they end up not learning anything about actual computers.

661
00:41:31,221 --> 00:41:33,793
Rym: but at the same time not everyone has to learn about the core computers.

662
00:41:33,813 --> 00:41:36,063
Rym: because I see some kids who Like.

663
00:41:36,183 --> 00:41:39,999
Rym: they use computers effectively like if they don't know something they immediately google it.

664
00:41:40,786 --> 00:41:42,157
Rym: But most kids don't even do.

665
00:41:42,238 --> 00:41:44,468
Scott: that I'm saying is I think it's the percent.

666
00:41:44,488 --> 00:41:47,720
Scott: All right, so back in the day some percentage of kids are gonna be computer.

667
00:41:48,623 --> 00:41:50,108
Scott: I don't think the percentage is increased.

668
00:41:50,751 --> 00:41:53,380
Scott: It's the same percentage as it was when we were in school.

669
00:41:53,572 --> 00:42:02,688
Scott: Yeah right But of that percentage in our day a hundred percent of the kids who are gonna be computer II Had to learn everything for reals because there was no other way.

670
00:42:02,929 --> 00:42:03,190
Rym: Yep.

671
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:12,783
Scott: Now same percentage of total kids will be computer internet II but a smaller percentage of that will actually learn anything about how Computers work.

672
00:42:13,204 --> 00:42:19,159
Scott: and the other person, you know of that small percent now just use computers and the same number of people don't know anything.

673
00:42:19,379 --> 00:42:23,280
Rym: Yep There's also this other factor that they just Facebook and Candy Crush.

674
00:42:23,621 --> 00:42:28,680
Rym: The other thing that they have that we didn't have is everyone else around them recording everything forever.

675
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:34,120
Rym: I mean all of us posted embarrassing shit when we were in like elementary school and middle school on internet places.

676
00:42:34,582 --> 00:42:36,152
Scott: I wish there had been more that would see.

677
00:42:36,172 --> 00:42:37,258
Scott: here's the thing people complain about.

678
00:42:37,278 --> 00:42:39,259
Scott: they're like Oh no ruin your life.

679
00:42:39,621 --> 00:42:45,340
Rym: I would give anything to be able to go back with things that I owe much that there was more documentation.

680
00:42:45,481 --> 00:42:54,939
Scott: I can go back and just see You know pictures videos Recorded accounts of dates and times because I don't remember much.

681
00:42:55,381 --> 00:42:58,096
Scott: Yep, if I had things recorded back in the day.

682
00:42:58,257 --> 00:42:58,740
Scott: Oh my god.

683
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:04,429
Scott: I mean if I've been able to save my pokemons to the cloud in high school and my original pokemons I still have them now.

684
00:43:04,449 --> 00:43:08,591
Rym: the other day I found a single picture that I didn't know existed.

685
00:43:08,631 --> 00:43:10,920
Rym: That was a picture of the inside of our apartment at RIT.

686
00:43:11,061 --> 00:43:12,419
Rym: That wasn't that long ago.

687
00:43:13,163 --> 00:43:19,109
Rym: It was like finding the remnants of the Holy Grail Like I'm looking in the background like look at that CRT.

688
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:20,393
Rym: who the fuck is that?

689
00:43:20,774 --> 00:43:22,560
Rym: Oh, right Scott on that Israeli flag.

690
00:43:22,983 --> 00:43:24,593
Rym: What are those huge speakers?

691
00:43:24,674 --> 00:43:25,499
Rym: What happened to those?

692
00:43:27,101 --> 00:43:27,985
Rym: Like huge speak.

693
00:43:28,306 --> 00:43:31,500
Rym: Yeah, we had these huge speakers just like laying on the floor next to my computer.

694
00:43:32,844 --> 00:43:36,645
Scott: They were like a foot and a half where those part of that like Set only a foot and a half.

695
00:43:36,685 --> 00:43:37,709
Scott: that was that black sound.

696
00:43:37,809 --> 00:43:40,880
Rym: right that awful sound system that you used as your speakers.

697
00:43:41,041 --> 00:43:42,867
Rym: Yeah uses my speakers and sorry.

698
00:43:42,927 --> 00:43:45,756
Scott: Yeah, I thought you meant huge speakers like, you know person tall.

699
00:43:45,876 --> 00:43:46,960
Rym: No not one foot.

700
00:43:47,001 --> 00:43:54,762
Rym: Yeah, no those part of that sound system Yeah And it was the boombox I had and I look at the screen and I saw that I was playing Final Fantasy 4 on my Computer.

701
00:43:54,782 --> 00:43:55,184
Rym: Mm-hmm.

702
00:43:55,304 --> 00:43:57,896
Rym: Just randomly and it looked like I was fighting as a Romans Paladin.

703
00:43:57,916 --> 00:44:06,218
Rym: Yeah but Kids now are growing up in a world where all everything they do is cataloged forever.

704
00:44:06,238 --> 00:44:17,039
Rym: if Their friends and or family are internet people Mm-hmm I think there's gonna be another digital divide between kids who have this documentation of their lives and kids who don't.

705
00:44:17,581 --> 00:44:20,520
Scott: Mmm, because if your parents have documentation of your life, right?

706
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,720
Scott: I mean we want documentation of our lives.

707
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,733
Scott: But what if your life was really shitty and you have documentation of it?

708
00:44:25,814 --> 00:44:26,818
Scott: And so it is everyone else.

709
00:44:26,959 --> 00:44:29,233
Rym: Yeah It could be bad it's good or bad.

710
00:44:29,293 --> 00:44:33,707
Rym: the thing is it's It's good and bad.

711
00:44:33,928 --> 00:44:36,580
Rym: it's fundamentally different and that's the only thing we can say about it.

712
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:37,806
Rym: We can't say if it's good or bad.

713
00:44:37,846 --> 00:44:39,775
Rym: It's just different and inevitable good and bad.

714
00:44:40,398 --> 00:44:47,920
Rym: Ah And yeah, well, maybe maybe it's not bad, but there's a short-term bad and a long-term good anyway.

715
00:44:48,523 --> 00:44:51,456
Scott: Yeah, if you got a time machine, you'll go take back and take video of my life.

716
00:44:51,737 --> 00:44:52,059
Scott: Please do.

717
00:44:53,062 --> 00:44:54,129
Scott: I don't care what happened then.

718
00:44:54,169 --> 00:44:54,713
Scott: I want to see it.

719
00:44:55,176 --> 00:45:02,640
Rym: So I guess I Don't know what to do about the divide because I'm thinking about that more and more and I think it's it's gonna be like.

720
00:45:02,941 --> 00:45:04,667
Rym: I think the digital divide there's.

721
00:45:04,748 --> 00:45:14,880
Rym: the way different children grow up with different access to technology is More controlled by their parents and the culture of their family than it is by a lot of other factors.

722
00:45:15,542 --> 00:45:27,114
Rym: And I think a lot of kids who would otherwise be internet e and smart if their parents are not also pushing them toward internet They will not internet and they will just be completely left behind by their peers who internet.

723
00:45:27,295 --> 00:45:29,099
Scott: let's predict this horrible dystopia.

724
00:45:29,723 --> 00:45:36,774
Scott: I don't know if it'll be a dystopia where the the Technological elite rule and the people who don't understand computers are peasants.

725
00:45:36,954 --> 00:45:37,937
Rym: That is what's gonna happen.

726
00:45:37,997 --> 00:45:38,599
Rym: I just don't know.

727
00:45:39,822 --> 00:45:40,988
Scott: That's just what you want to happen.

728
00:45:41,068 --> 00:45:42,013
Rym: No, I really don't.

729
00:45:42,033 --> 00:45:52,353
Scott: I I imagine I think it's gonna be more like ghost in the shell right where yeah, there are people who are super internet, but People are getting by and people aren't peasants, right?

730
00:45:52,373 --> 00:46:09,478
Rym: They're just getting by an internet world I guess I just I imagined a world where everyone I interact with on a daily basis Had the personal capability of googling things they didn't know And I realized that that is utopia for me.

731
00:46:09,823 --> 00:46:17,840
Rym: Mm-hmm If the average person that I talked to Knew just I had a vague awareness that anytime they didn't know something they could just google it and they did that.

732
00:46:18,342 --> 00:46:21,136
Rym: I can't imagine the kinds of conversations I would have with strangers.

733
00:46:21,559 --> 00:46:21,820
Scott: people.

734
00:46:21,941 --> 00:46:22,744
Scott: What about people who?

735
00:46:23,226 --> 00:46:25,335
Scott: it seems like they just don't want to know things.

736
00:46:25,456 --> 00:46:28,065
Scott: Yeah It's like people just have.

737
00:46:28,085 --> 00:46:29,129
Scott: they just do things right?

738
00:46:29,169 --> 00:46:30,594
Scott: It's like they watch TV.

739
00:46:31,236 --> 00:46:34,288
Scott: They go to work They get drunk.

740
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:35,996
Rym: So, how do we go to sleep?

741
00:46:36,237 --> 00:46:43,170
Scott: They eat food They don't want to know things Hunger for knowledge because we didn't have internet.

742
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:44,714
Rym: and then we did a group without internet.

743
00:46:45,116 --> 00:46:46,560
Rym: and then one day I got access to internet.

744
00:46:46,962 --> 00:47:00,900
Rym: And basically if you chart that my life and what I was doing with different percentages of my time The day I got access to the real internet ice the majority of my time Became that to the exclusion of almost everything else.

745
00:47:01,252 --> 00:47:06,790
Rym: Yeah It was like I was walking through the desert and then someone walked over and said Here's a spigot of infinite water.

746
00:47:07,071 --> 00:47:11,611
Rym: use it as much as you want for the rest of your life Drinking for the rest of my life mostly so.

747
00:47:11,631 --> 00:47:13,760
