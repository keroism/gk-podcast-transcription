1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,891
Rym: It's September 29th 2016.

2
00:00:12,891 --> 00:00:17,849
Rym: I'm Rym, I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight road trips.

3
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:21,825
Rym: Let's do this.

4
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,080
Rym: Yeah, this morning co-workers sent an email to the team.

5
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,992
Rym: We're just like yeah gonna be late trouble with the path trains And I didn't think anything of it until then.

6
00:00:35,032 --> 00:00:41,800
Scott: I saw a path was trending on Twitter And I'm like well, but if the path train wasn't the thing that had a problem It just happened to also be in the station that had the problem.

7
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,529
Rym: Yep, well because the it'd be like if the subway was down.

8
00:00:44,709 --> 00:00:48,762
Rym: subway might be trending even though the problem is Grand Central Station's broken Or something.

9
00:00:48,863 --> 00:00:51,132
Scott: what Grand Central Station is where subways are.

10
00:00:51,152 --> 00:00:52,879
Scott: yeah, it's not well.

11
00:00:52,919 --> 00:01:03,240
Rym: Yeah I was about to jump back and make that distinction and if they depending on how they do that train track They're building underground it might not be a terminal anymore.

12
00:01:04,301 --> 00:01:05,926
Rym: Maybe might end up being a station again.

13
00:01:06,347 --> 00:01:07,390
Rym: Maybe anyway.

14
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:17,200
Rym: Oh, they got a little infographic, and it shows the train, but yeah And a train in New Jersey just didn't stop and crashed through the terminal.

15
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,514
Scott: This is a Jersey Transit train so it goes.

16
00:01:19,635 --> 00:01:20,440
Scott: It's in New Jersey.

17
00:01:21,022 --> 00:01:32,620
Scott: It goes underneath the river blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah, and then it comes into Penn Station underneath the garden Yeah, and then it stops because that's the end of the road into the second worst way to come into New York City basically.

18
00:01:32,841 --> 00:01:36,820
Scott: But this one wasn't coming into Penn Station yet It was going to Hoboken.

19
00:01:37,661 --> 00:01:39,026
Scott: Right it goes to Hoboken where

20
00:01:39,046 --> 00:01:39,970
Rym: the hobos live and

21
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:53,340
Scott: then people in Hoboken in New Jersey get off And they either work in Hoboken which is weird But there's stuff over there or they get on a PATH train which then comes over to New York City You know in somewhere close to Penn Station or the World Trade Center.

22
00:01:53,421 --> 00:01:54,472
Rym: I want to reiterate that there.

23
00:01:54,573 --> 00:02:02,600
Rym: well not reiterate but we could have had subways that just go into New Jersey and From New York because so many people commute that way and it would have been great.

24
00:02:02,902 --> 00:02:04,631
Rym: We could have had a tunnel we could have had.

25
00:02:04,652 --> 00:02:05,476
Scott: well we have tunnels.

26
00:02:05,496 --> 00:02:06,100
Scott: we need more tunnel.

27
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,345
Scott: We could have had a new tunnel.

28
00:02:07,465 --> 00:02:08,348
Scott: I don't need more tunnels.

29
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:10,096
Scott: the Jersey people want more, but fuck them.

30
00:02:10,156 --> 00:02:10,317
Scott: I don't.

31
00:02:10,336 --> 00:02:16,399
Rym: yeah If we had the tunnels though it probably drive rent down a little bit here because then suddenly like people who?

32
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,790
Rym: Hate New York or are dumb could move to New Jersey more.

33
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,034
Scott: plenty of people live it.

34
00:02:21,134 --> 00:02:24,686
Scott: so many people live in Jersey and commute To New York from way down.

35
00:02:24,706 --> 00:02:29,763
Scott: there are people who live like way down in Jersey even in Pennsylvania who take the bus to the City every day.

36
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:30,646
Scott: yeah, and they don't.

37
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:31,068
Scott: that's like.

38
00:02:31,088 --> 00:02:31,911
Scott: that's just how they do.

39
00:02:31,932 --> 00:02:33,980
Rym: I could not do that this ferries.

40
00:02:34,283 --> 00:02:35,455
Scott: It's like there's so many.

41
00:02:35,475 --> 00:02:40,494
Scott: you can live Top half of New Jersey you can live and commute to New York City.

42
00:02:40,514 --> 00:02:47,137
Rym: I was looking at a job That was would be like an awesome job that I would want to do and like.

43
00:02:47,217 --> 00:02:50,938
Rym: I was qualified And they were interested even like I talked to some people about it.

44
00:02:51,481 --> 00:02:56,320
Rym: But their main office is in New Jersey like even though it's right near New York, and I was like that's a deal-breaker.

45
00:02:57,063 --> 00:03:01,219
Rym: I work from home 100% or you move an office into New York or this isn't happening pretty much.

46
00:03:02,001 --> 00:03:07,554
Rym: Yeah, technically this job is in New Jersey Nope, but yeah, so here's the crazy thing.

47
00:03:07,957 --> 00:03:12,380
Rym: apparently I don't know if it's on the same track or not because the news was surprisingly sparse.

48
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,758
Rym: But like five years ago this exact same thing happened and injured like 40 people.

49
00:03:16,778 --> 00:03:20,191
Rym: it Just was going slower and didn't destroy the building.

50
00:03:20,272 --> 00:03:22,380
Scott: yeah, didn't destroy the building it didn't kill anyone.

51
00:03:22,521 --> 00:03:25,233
Scott: So it wasn't a big news then and it was quickly forgotten.

52
00:03:25,433 --> 00:03:29,777
Scott: this one was much more serious But basically the same thing which tells me something is fucking wrong.

53
00:03:29,797 --> 00:03:32,007
Rym: in that stage How can the train like say that?

54
00:03:32,228 --> 00:03:35,400
Rym: say the person driving the train like had a heart attack and fell over and died?

55
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:35,981
Rym: Don't?

56
00:03:36,001 --> 00:03:39,719
Rym: they have like some sort of positive control where if you let's go with the stick the train just stops.

57
00:03:40,021 --> 00:03:53,940
Scott: there were many discussions of this and from what I seen from certain train nerds is that the interval on the positive Thing may have you know been so long that like they push it then they fall asleep.

58
00:03:54,582 --> 00:03:59,160
Rym: Then and like 30 seconds before it would like stop the train and that was just like the critical moment.

59
00:03:59,321 --> 00:04:07,440
Scott: Also, there's there was some regulation that said every train in the Northeast had to have this thing set up But they're not sure if the budget was ever set for it.

60
00:04:07,561 --> 00:04:09,920
Rym: Oh, I think I talked about that when there was an Amtrak.

61
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:15,680
Scott: They don't know which they don't know if this station or which stations it's been set up in or not.

62
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:25,380
Rym: Basically, there's all these separate stories about a ton of safety improvements for rail in New York New Jersey in the United States as a whole and in all three of those places.

63
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:30,340
Rym: Basically, the government sucks and can't actually fund these things.

64
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:35,621
Scott: I don't think we actually said with what happened is that the train was coming into the station in Hoboken and it went into the Station.

65
00:04:35,682 --> 00:04:39,720
Scott: it didn't stop and it kept going into the station and but it was the end of the track.

66
00:04:39,861 --> 00:04:42,436
Scott: So it went and it smashed the building and smashed the people.

67
00:04:42,476 --> 00:04:47,380
Rym: it bumped it Crashed through the thing that we both forgot the name of and I forget the name of it again.

68
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,526
Rym: So I'm gonna Google right now buffer.

69
00:04:48,547 --> 00:04:49,431
Scott: Stop buffer.

70
00:04:49,452 --> 00:04:49,713
Rym: Stop.

71
00:04:49,753 --> 00:04:57,740
Rym: Yes thing that stops Train at the end of the track, so it had to be going pretty fast.

72
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,200
Scott: But actually I have a second hand account.

73
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:07,540
Scott: So one of a person who plays netrunner has a co-worker who was on this train not on some next to it train.

74
00:05:07,806 --> 00:05:15,433
Scott: Yeah Coming into that station on that very train and the story was That the train didn't actually seem to be going that fast.

75
00:05:15,533 --> 00:05:16,517
Scott: It just didn't stop.

76
00:05:16,698 --> 00:05:17,561
Rym: Well, that's the thing It's like.

77
00:05:17,581 --> 00:05:19,168
Rym: well, there's so much momentum there.

78
00:05:19,248 --> 00:05:28,660
Scott: a train that's going train is now a train is big first of all But also those MV also, you know If you're a person who's used to cars and trains and not biking and walking.

79
00:05:29,202 --> 00:05:31,812
Scott: You don't realize like 20 miles an hour feels slow.

80
00:05:31,812 --> 00:05:33,740
Scott: 30 miles an hour feels slow, right?

81
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:38,000
Scott: So the train could have been going like I. even 40 feels slow to people when you drive cars a lot.

82
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:43,363
Scott: In fact, the only reason you might actually train was going like 70 and then slowed down to 40.

83
00:05:43,363 --> 00:05:48,208
Scott: You know, it feels slow even though it's coming into the station Like the only reason you might notice cuz one is commute.

84
00:05:48,268 --> 00:05:51,118
Rym: So everyone's asleep or you know doing their thing.

85
00:05:51,138 --> 00:05:59,518
Rym: So Maybe you might look out the window and be like Are we getting close to the station and it's still going like it hasn't like slowed down yet, right?

86
00:05:59,578 --> 00:06:06,477
Scott: So So yeah, so that we don't know how fast the train was going But you know, it's probably faster than it should have been.

87
00:06:06,537 --> 00:06:08,885
Scott: obviously The train obviously didn't stop.

88
00:06:09,066 --> 00:06:11,656
Scott: We don't know why yet at least hasn't been reported yet.

89
00:06:11,736 --> 00:06:12,640
Scott: Maybe someone knows why.

90
00:06:13,301 --> 00:06:14,566
Scott: I'm sure the engineer knows why.

91
00:06:14,686 --> 00:06:18,220
Rym: no well, so he was apparently injured and unconscious and they pulled him out of the train.

92
00:06:18,282 --> 00:06:25,580
Rym: I'm sure people on Park at least were saying that he was bolt at the front of the train in the back of the train and then People are talking about how there's a shift change.

93
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,560
Rym: We're like they moved to the front of the train.

94
00:06:27,781 --> 00:06:34,988
Scott: You don't move to the front of the train while the trains coming to the station or like someone else takes over like no one The procedures of this train.

95
00:06:35,008 --> 00:06:35,931
Scott: the trainer does.

96
00:06:35,951 --> 00:06:37,295
Scott: where's that guy with the hat?

97
00:06:37,376 --> 00:06:38,680
Rym: that guy probably posted on a fork later.

98
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,671
Scott: Anyway, so Like this just nobody down the ceiling right?

99
00:06:45,771 --> 00:06:48,200
Scott: Nobody pulled the emergency brake on the train.

100
00:06:48,281 --> 00:06:49,839
Scott: This is the one time you're supposed to pull it.

101
00:06:50,067 --> 00:06:54,334
Rym: Yeah Usually people pull it because like someone's having a heart attack and they're dumb and don't know what.

102
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:57,349
Scott: I think if you're on a train There's an emergency brake.

103
00:06:57,369 --> 00:07:02,800
Scott: that's always like big red and obvious And depending on the train and where you are in the world it works differently.

104
00:07:02,961 --> 00:07:03,824
Scott: but don't worry about that.

105
00:07:03,864 --> 00:07:06,596
Scott: all you need to worry about is when should you pull that thing?

106
00:07:06,616 --> 00:07:09,076
Rym: and the answer is If you don't know never.

107
00:07:09,097 --> 00:07:11,668
Scott: yeah The answer is almost never right.

108
00:07:11,788 --> 00:07:16,209
Scott: if someone is like on the train with a gun shooting people Do not pull that.

109
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,360
Scott: that is not going to help you.

110
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,247
Rym: In fact that will leave you alone with the gunman.

111
00:07:19,287 --> 00:07:26,031
Scott: now now the train is stopped and the train cannot move again for a Significant period of time until like a pneumatic thing is reset.

112
00:07:26,152 --> 00:07:28,299
Scott: so fun as a crazy person with a gun there.

113
00:07:29,406 --> 00:07:30,623
Scott: Almost any emergency.

114
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:31,647
Scott: you do not want to pull that.

115
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:37,591
Scott: you want the train to keep moving so it can get to a station so that you Can run to safety and emergency people can get on the train.

116
00:07:37,652 --> 00:07:39,620
Rym: Did you watch that whole elevator lecture?

117
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,898
Rym: I used this thing a day a long time ago.

118
00:07:41,701 --> 00:07:46,760
Rym: No, because there's a whole section where elevators shitty and old elevators have an emergency stop button, right?

119
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:52,053
Rym: Modern elevators don't because that button is only used for ill.

120
00:07:52,374 --> 00:07:56,295
Rym: it is primarily used to Beat someone up in an elevator.

121
00:07:56,597 --> 00:07:58,779
Rym: Yes You know why that button was there.

122
00:07:59,442 --> 00:08:03,540
Rym: Because when elevators were stirred first being introduced mass market in the u.s.

123
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,980
Scott: Like modern elevators and modern buildings or they mostly manually controlled them.

124
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:14,500
Rym: Oh, no, no, like this is when like modern elevators, okay People were dumb and legit afraid of elevators that button was there.

125
00:08:14,821 --> 00:08:20,962
Rym: So they would see the emergency stop button and feel like they could do something if the elevator fucked up Mm-hmm.

126
00:08:21,324 --> 00:08:27,288
Rym: and no one real no one thought except elevator engineers About the use case where you basically don't like.

127
00:08:27,308 --> 00:08:28,712
Rym: there's no reason to have a button like that.

128
00:08:28,752 --> 00:08:32,160
Rym: that button can only harm and never Help.

129
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:32,522
Scott: Yes.

130
00:08:32,643 --> 00:08:41,089
Scott: Anyway, the elevators falling that buttons not gonna stop here here the there are probably more instances But these are the only reasons that I know of that.

131
00:08:41,149 --> 00:08:44,097
Scott: you should absolutely pull that emergency brake on the train.

132
00:08:44,198 --> 00:08:50,920
Scott: number one Someone's like caught in the door or being dragged by the train or between the cars or the trait you see with your eyes.

133
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,540
Scott: The train is about to kill someone if it continues to move.

134
00:08:53,642 --> 00:08:54,519
Rym: It's a trolley problem.

135
00:08:54,721 --> 00:09:00,500
Scott: And therefore if you pull the lever you will say like if someone's arm is caught in the subway door and it starts fucking moving.

136
00:09:00,742 --> 00:09:03,200
Scott: Yeah over like for real and the conductor doesn't notice.

137
00:09:03,402 --> 00:09:05,359
Scott: Yeah, then you run and pull it as fast as you can.

138
00:09:05,621 --> 00:09:06,905
Scott: Otherwise the person will die.

139
00:09:07,186 --> 00:09:11,060
Rym: number two, you're in the front car and you are barreling toward an obstacle.

140
00:09:11,081 --> 00:09:16,457
Scott: Yeah you can tell the train is not stopping when it should be stopping like such as the thing that happened today.

141
00:09:16,617 --> 00:09:26,610
Scott: or three if Somehow like it's an old-fashioned old western movie and the train is detached and it's sort of rolling away on its own That's when you.

142
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:27,517
Scott: that's what that's for.

143
00:09:27,578 --> 00:09:27,759
Scott: Right?

144
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:32,758
Scott: So other than that, you should push the emergency intercom button and not the emergency brake.

145
00:09:32,859 --> 00:09:46,520
Scott: Leo I blame also trained designers for making the emergency brake very very prominent and making the emergency intercom Not as prom pretty sure that's a regulatory holdover from far ancient times much like the elevator thing is anyway.

146
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:51,320
Scott: So the second thing right is you know, yeah, this is this is not good.

147
00:09:51,461 --> 00:09:52,392
Scott: They got to fix them train.

148
00:09:52,412 --> 00:09:53,823
Rym: one person was killed No one on the train.

149
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:57,160
Rym: the person who was killed was a woman who was standing just in the station.

150
00:09:57,281 --> 00:09:58,730
Scott: I think this is the most dangerous place to be.

151
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,656
Scott: you got hit by a train.

152
00:09:59,878 --> 00:10:02,627
Scott: Yeah Basically as bad as standing on the tracks.

153
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,012
Scott: only you weren't standing on the tracks.

154
00:10:04,072 --> 00:10:06,382
Rym: Yeah, you know your bagel What am I?

155
00:10:06,422 --> 00:10:08,331
Rym: co-workers was like man?

156
00:10:08,371 --> 00:10:09,255
Rym: This is tragic view.

157
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,984
Rym: The worst part about it is Died on the commute.

158
00:10:12,065 --> 00:10:13,932
Rym: No one should ever die on their come.

159
00:10:13,952 --> 00:10:15,278
Scott: Yeah, this is clearly tragic.

160
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:21,179
Scott: yet I just want to point out the thing that I point out often which is they're so upset over this.

161
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:29,360
Scott: But meanwhile more people than one person died in cars today and more attention was given to this than to all those people who died.

162
00:10:29,982 --> 00:10:35,900
Rym: statistically About point seven people die per day in New York City as a result of cars.

163
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,643
Rym: So it's possible.

164
00:10:36,683 --> 00:10:39,112
Rym: No one died today in New York City.

165
00:10:39,192 --> 00:10:41,120
Scott: only right that's per day.

166
00:10:41,621 --> 00:10:46,235
Scott: So if we wait like a week more, yeah, we wait two days.

167
00:10:46,295 --> 00:10:47,839
Scott: no two days, it'll be worse than this.

168
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,285
Rym: Well, it's like the terror thing.

169
00:10:49,526 --> 00:10:53,827
Rym: if this happened every day for the next year It's still.

170
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:57,747
Rym: actually if it happened every day for the next year It would be on par with.

171
00:10:57,787 --> 00:10:59,775
Rym: it'd be similar to the damage caused by cars.

172
00:11:00,137 --> 00:11:03,110
Rym: Yeah I guess the different people are not.

173
00:11:03,151 --> 00:11:07,548
Scott: people are now because of you know Reporting not being realistic people.

174
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:11,603
Rym: I've not seen anyone who was like we need to do something crazy About this.

175
00:11:11,643 --> 00:11:14,300
Scott: no New Yorkers aren't gonna be but people elsewhere.

176
00:11:14,421 --> 00:11:15,767
Scott: Right who get these?

177
00:11:15,827 --> 00:11:18,420
Scott: people who don't live in New York are the ones who are afraid of things, right?

178
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,360
Scott: So now all these non New Yorkers gonna be afraid of trains?

179
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,430
Scott: I know they still get in their cars without fear every day.

180
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:29,147
Rym: I encountered two separate individuals Just because I was outside a lot.

181
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:29,448
Rym: cuz weird.

182
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:32,060
Rym: So we were doing headshots again in the office today.

183
00:11:32,141 --> 00:11:33,591
Rym: So I was like outside doing a photo shoot.

184
00:11:33,671 --> 00:11:34,900
Rym: I was outside like walking around a lot.

185
00:11:35,321 --> 00:11:47,200
Rym: I encountered two separate people both of whom happened to be older white gentlemen And both of whom heard that this might have been intentional and that they arrested the conductor.

186
00:11:47,602 --> 00:11:49,591
Rym: So that's the level of discourse that's out there.

187
00:11:49,832 --> 00:11:50,073
Rym: Yeah.

188
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:51,480
Scott: Yeah, it's not a good level.

189
00:11:51,781 --> 00:11:52,683
Rym: Yeah, I don't.

190
00:11:52,743 --> 00:11:56,052
Scott: but the point is is they should be reporting on the news.

191
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:59,020
Scott: Holy shit cars are killing people all over the place.

192
00:11:59,203 --> 00:12:03,010
Scott: Yeah, right Trains killed three one person this year.

193
00:12:03,311 --> 00:12:09,800
Rym: the narrative of a car killing someone is yeah bad driver Yeah, and also there is an infrastructure thing.

194
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:15,120
Rym: So let's take a cold analytical point ignoring the human toll because obviously cars have a much higher human toll.

195
00:12:15,822 --> 00:12:20,176
Rym: Look at damage to infrastructure and the GDP and all that sort of stuff.

196
00:12:20,557 --> 00:12:27,422
Scott: every car accident delays everyone commuting on that road for like an hour or two which adds up when you add up all those the time for All those people.

197
00:12:27,482 --> 00:12:31,099
Rym: this might have taken Hoboken terminal out of admission for like a month.

198
00:12:31,582 --> 00:12:32,165
Scott: Yeah, that's bad.

199
00:12:32,386 --> 00:12:37,752
Rym: Like it took the roof down like they This thing might not come up.

200
00:12:37,772 --> 00:12:40,455
Scott: gotta raise the roof literally.

201
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:46,190
Rym: so the moral is Don't live in New Jersey live in New York.

202
00:12:46,231 --> 00:12:47,577
Rym: If you're gonna commute to New York Jesus.

203
00:12:47,598 --> 00:12:48,020
Scott: That's right.

204
00:12:48,281 --> 00:12:51,470
Rym: That's the real moral like the commute on path.

205
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,236
Rym: So, you know transit is just kind of sad.

206
00:12:53,577 --> 00:12:55,625
Scott: Uh, I mean I've never done this.

207
00:12:55,726 --> 00:12:57,718
Scott: I've always when I wait for a train I wait next to it.

208
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:05,351
Scott: But well in New York, so already like I mean, I've never I've never waited for a train in front of it But I'm now consciously not going to.

209
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:07,380
Rym: well the thing is here even if you're not directly.

210
00:13:08,241 --> 00:13:16,257
Rym: Here's the nice diagram if a trains a train Scott go into the waiting room and you know where else this is true Boston When I take the Amtrak, that's true.

211
00:13:16,298 --> 00:13:22,180
Rym: Yeah Yeah, like think those trains like the Acela train comes straight in like say the Acela didn't stop at South Station.

212
00:13:22,441 --> 00:13:26,233
Rym: Yeah, it'll barrel right into like that mac and cheese place that we always eat ahead.

213
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:26,794
Scott: That's true.

214
00:13:27,517 --> 00:13:28,440
Rym: So it's not any better.

215
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:33,902
Rym: but yeah, the other moral is Moral.

216
00:13:33,922 --> 00:13:37,517
Rym: just don't live in New Jersey, but like in New York, it's the biggest news today.

217
00:13:37,578 --> 00:13:38,562
Scott: So whatever Yeah,

218
00:13:38,963 --> 00:13:43,219
Rym: and it impacted me a little bit because one of my co-workers sent an email that was like yeah gonna be late

219
00:13:44,009 --> 00:13:44,136
Scott: Yep

220
00:13:45,121 --> 00:13:54,120
Rym: so the other news that's moderately important that you should really pay attention to is that uh, I know like you I Doubt you listen to GeekNights and think vaccines are fake.

221
00:13:54,201 --> 00:14:00,057
Rym: I feel like we've weeded those people out a long time ago But I suspect there's at least some of you is actually a great story today.

222
00:14:00,117 --> 00:14:09,587
Scott: some Some lady who didn't give her kids any vaccines and then her kids all got rotavirus and the whole family was like shitting up The storm for like three weeks.

223
00:14:09,727 --> 00:14:10,752
Scott: and then she changed her mind.

224
00:14:10,812 --> 00:14:11,455
Scott: was the headline?

225
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:13,689
Rym: local woman encounters Facts.

226
00:14:13,851 --> 00:14:17,091
Scott: Yeah And then her best friend was still anti-vaxx.

227
00:14:17,112 --> 00:14:19,040
Scott: So she lost her best friend, but she's okay with that.

228
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:20,920
Rym: That would be okay with that too, right?

229
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:28,549
Rym: But a lot of people don't get the flu shot and usually everyone cites that Lewis black comedy routine about how it gives you the Flu which is not true, which is funny.

230
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:30,540
Rym: Yeah, but guys get your flu shots.

231
00:14:31,442 --> 00:14:33,010
Rym: And one because I don't want you.

232
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:35,040
Scott: the thing is comparing the flu to packs.

233
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:39,072
Scott: Yeah, the other thing is that flu the flu shot in particular is actually every year.

234
00:14:39,092 --> 00:14:41,520
Scott: They basically guess which flu.

235
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,804
Scott: It's a very educated guess.

236
00:14:42,864 --> 00:14:44,831
Scott: It's not a random guess right?

237
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,055
Scott: which flus?

238
00:14:46,075 --> 00:14:47,640
Scott: because there's bunches of different flus.

239
00:14:48,742 --> 00:14:50,590
Scott: All of it was only one flu.

240
00:14:50,611 --> 00:14:54,185
Scott: like we'd be set already it would be gone like measles Yeah, but there's so many flus.

241
00:14:54,567 --> 00:14:55,831
Scott: So they've picked.

242
00:14:55,871 --> 00:14:58,300
Scott: they say ah these flus look hot this year.

243
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:03,400
Scott: Let's put these X number of flus in the flu shot, but you could still get another flu.

244
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,933
Scott: They've also some years been wrong and some flu got really hot.

245
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:09,965
Scott: that wasn't in the vaccine and they had to change it up But it's probably too late.

246
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:18,551
Scott: Yeah, so, you know based on the year Alright, you know the flu shot has different stuff in it, which is why you need to get it every year So you don't get the flu.

247
00:15:18,571 --> 00:15:19,440
Rym: also it does.

248
00:15:20,263 --> 00:15:27,770
Rym: I saw another thing people get it way early like people are like real into the flu shot and then it wears off by the Season really starts and then they get the flu.

249
00:15:27,911 --> 00:15:28,514
Scott: See that's the thing.

250
00:15:28,554 --> 00:15:31,820
Scott: I don't understand right like I had MMR a long time ago.

251
00:15:31,962 --> 00:15:38,520
Scott: I was way small But I never had to get a. I did get it like once again ever when I was also very little and then never again.

252
00:15:39,122 --> 00:15:41,531
Scott: It's like tetanus shot lasts a really long time.

253
00:15:41,591 --> 00:15:43,478
Scott: How does a flu shot only last like a season?

254
00:15:43,558 --> 00:15:43,880
Scott: Well, there's.

255
00:15:45,145 --> 00:15:48,700
Rym: so I have rudimentary knowledge of the answer to that question.

256
00:15:48,805 --> 00:15:55,235
Rym: however If I actually open my mouth I can think of at least two people who listen to the show who are gonna Basically, right.

257
00:15:56,182 --> 00:16:00,520
Scott: Also, it's like, you know, you get that, you know, you get chicken pox once and then you never get it again.

258
00:16:00,701 --> 00:16:03,030
Rym: Well ever you might get shingles or something later.

259
00:16:03,091 --> 00:16:05,340
Scott: Yes, but you never get chicken pox again ever.

260
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,758
Scott: It just lasts for your entire fucking life.

261
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,269
Rym: But there's so part of that work so well.

262
00:16:10,309 --> 00:16:16,171
Rym: part of it is that you know different diseases are different obviously But also that the immunity how are they?

263
00:16:16,352 --> 00:16:18,199
Rym: how many receptors can you have like?

264
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,940
Rym: Imagine if you wanted to have be vaccinated against every virus in the known world.

265
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:26,053
Rym: Okay, I don't think your immune system has enough receptor.

266
00:16:26,073 --> 00:16:27,740
Rym: like you couldn't keep enough receptors in your blood.

267
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,504
Scott: You don't have enough.

268
00:16:28,524 --> 00:16:33,751
Scott: you have enough disk space to hold all the members like theoretically There's not enough DNA's to make all the different.

269
00:16:33,771 --> 00:16:35,137
Rym: like theoretically there's a limit.

270
00:16:35,237 --> 00:16:37,085
Rym: Well, not theoretically There's definitely a limit.

271
00:16:37,346 --> 00:16:42,149
Rym: and how much you can know like there's a physical brains of physical size There's only so much information.

272
00:16:42,189 --> 00:16:43,739
Rym: It can actually hold in itself.

273
00:16:44,341 --> 00:16:46,848
Scott: Yeah, but I mean, you know, how many viruses are there?

274
00:16:46,888 --> 00:16:47,109
Scott: right?

275
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:47,630
Scott: lot?

276
00:16:47,991 --> 00:16:51,040
Rym: Yeah, how many a lot and I'm gonna guess billions.

277
00:16:51,281 --> 00:16:52,948
Scott: All right, how many cells are in my body?

278
00:16:53,229 --> 00:16:53,610
Rym: what you did?

279
00:16:53,651 --> 00:16:55,016
Rym: Yes, so you've got one cell.

280
00:16:57,582 --> 00:17:05,534
Scott: Each cell can remember one virus and I think when the time Cell can multiply fight the virus and then reduce itself back to one cell it.

281
00:17:05,855 --> 00:17:08,188
Rym: I don't think it multiplies I'm not.

282
00:17:08,229 --> 00:17:09,300
Scott: no that's not how it works.

283
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:14,579
Scott: I'm saying that's how it could work if someone was making the system by hand not how it does work.

284
00:17:14,741 --> 00:17:17,779
Scott: Yes, we could decide how it does work as every cell has the same shit.

285
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:24,560
Rym: It's all We could design cracker humans who are engineered to not get sick with a special immune system.

286
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,987
Scott: Yes, that's what I'm saying.

287
00:17:26,288 --> 00:17:28,680
Scott: But anyway, get your fucking flu shots.

288
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:37,760
Rym: You don't bring the flu to packs because I got a flu from a packs Not that long ago and to the CDC is actually up their ante and is more strongly recommending.

289
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,755
Scott: Yeah, they used to say like old people and little kids should get it.

290
00:17:40,795 --> 00:17:41,619
Scott: Otherwise you'll die.

291
00:17:41,659 --> 00:17:47,100
Scott: now They're like yo everybody everyone you are a breathing human being get this flu shot.

292
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,491
Rym: The reason is less people are getting the flu vaccine.

293
00:17:50,772 --> 00:17:51,976
Rym: So one fuck them.

294
00:17:52,016 --> 00:17:55,070
Rym: At least if you get the vaccine You're more likely to be okay mandatory.

295
00:17:55,111 --> 00:17:56,337
Scott: We just exile anyone who doesn't.

296
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:57,786
Rym: yeah Unless you have a metal.

297
00:17:57,807 --> 00:17:59,399
Scott: so it should be free and the government pays for it.

298
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,449
Rym: Yeah, well, I think we need single-payer universal health.

299
00:18:02,489 --> 00:18:05,579
Scott: You can't make it mandatory if right if it's not if they're not paying for it.

300
00:18:06,264 --> 00:18:06,876
Scott: car insurance.

301
00:18:09,924 --> 00:18:11,519
Rym: But yeah, seriously guys get your flu shot.

302
00:18:12,202 --> 00:18:16,518
Rym: I'm gonna get mine probably this week or next week or real soon free ones in my work everybody.

303
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:19,529
Rym: Yeah You don't work there and my old company.

304
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,940
Rym: They brought a nurse in and gave everyone flu shots.

305
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:22,603
Scott: Yeah, that's what we're doing.

306
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:32,039
Rym: If you were on to my work does if you're on the ops team, you could not opt out Unless you had a doctor's note saying why you couldn't get it or proving that you already got it.

307
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,989
Rym: But that only applied to mission critical staff.

308
00:18:35,491 --> 00:18:38,280
Rym: Mmm now side note mission critical staff and that company.

309
00:18:38,703 --> 00:18:42,946
Rym: We also had bug out bags that had One hour respirators.

310
00:18:42,987 --> 00:18:46,280
Rym: we had ropes and we're telling stuff to get out of the building through the window.

311
00:18:46,862 --> 00:18:52,238
Rym: We had like all this like whistles and emergency bullshit, but only mission critical employees got that.

312
00:18:52,338 --> 00:19:02,391
Rym: everyone else didn't okay, so like the ops team and Like certain traders and the like the board like those people all got him but like all the salespeople in middle the office didn't get shit.

313
00:19:08,073 --> 00:19:10,350
Rym: but anyway things of the day.

314
00:19:10,493 --> 00:19:22,429
Rym: so as you all know I'm a big fan of Neil Cicierega's mouth silence and mouth sounds and his area like basically all his like mash stuff up Really heavily style of thing.

315
00:19:22,851 --> 00:19:27,710
Scott: Yeah, see normal people like King Midas because he touches things turns into gold but Rym likes.

316
00:19:27,991 --> 00:19:30,846
Scott: You know King Neil who touches everything and turns it into something.

317
00:19:30,866 --> 00:19:31,289
Scott: Rym likes.

318
00:19:31,349 --> 00:19:34,898
Rym: Yep He's one of my favorite creators.

319
00:19:34,939 --> 00:19:35,942
Scott: internet garbage.

320
00:19:36,002 --> 00:19:36,203
Scott: Yep.

321
00:19:36,504 --> 00:19:38,210
Rym: Just like skeletons dancing around.

322
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:44,710
Rym: Yeah, I could go to each e but I found this other person Grant Willard and his channel is great.

323
00:19:45,131 --> 00:19:51,230
Rym: But I'm gonna link to two videos that he did because these are very Neil Cicierega and style mass up mash ups.

324
00:19:51,914 --> 00:19:52,900
Rym: but what he does?

325
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:58,347
Rym: so this first one is Literally, he took jingles to a bunch of commercials.

326
00:19:58,367 --> 00:20:01,668
Rym: Mm-hmm Like all you know commercial jingles like Kit Kats and McDonald's or whatever.

327
00:20:02,473 --> 00:20:07,234
Rym: He played the jingles on a piano using the products they sell To hit the keys.

328
00:20:07,254 --> 00:20:12,670
Rym: Okay, and then he made this whole song that mashes them all up together musically to be a complete song.

329
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:17,990
Rym: No, and it's just really good and really well done kind of like mouth sounds.

330
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:21,139
Rym: Okay, this other one is more like mouth silence.

331
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,346
Rym: It's just called it classical music mashup.

332
00:20:23,927 --> 00:20:24,670
Rym: He mashed up.

333
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:34,503
Rym: He made a song that is just the tunes from 57 famous classical songs from among 33 composers and he has this great.

334
00:20:34,523 --> 00:20:38,911
Rym: I can't even name 33 composers like Dvorak Gershwin.

335
00:20:39,092 --> 00:20:39,534
Scott: yeah, I can.

336
00:20:39,594 --> 00:20:44,231
Scott: I can name a lot but I can't name 33. since then I don't know who that is Really?

337
00:20:44,391 --> 00:20:49,586
Scott: No, but says ends song of fame a bunch of concertos and things like.

338
00:20:49,667 --> 00:20:50,830
Rym: can you march of the animals?

339
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,379
Scott: I don't know March of the Animals.

340
00:20:52,439 --> 00:20:55,281
Scott: Okay, sing it for me Metal a sin.

341
00:20:55,523 --> 00:20:58,576
Scott: so you don't know Song again, you don't want me to sing.

342
00:20:58,617 --> 00:20:59,460
Rym: it's playing right now.

343
00:21:00,023 --> 00:21:01,208
Rym: Bunch of this stuff is playing right now.

Rym: Do you know which ones which?

347
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:09,460
Rym: no I don't even know the difference between all the different box.

348
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:22,618
Rym: I always forget this was your pond and here's some W See it, but the crazy thing is this works as music and is really good and It's like mouth silence in that regard.

349
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:26,050
Rym: So this guy's channel is amazing and these mashups are amazing.

350
00:21:26,632 --> 00:21:27,134
Rym: It's what he got.

351
00:21:27,415 --> 00:21:31,090
Scott: So I've heard of people having all sorts of crazy pets in this world, right?

352
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:33,880
Scott: You know just about any animal has been made a pet by someone.

353
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:40,330
Scott: there's someone out there with like, you know pet wolf pet tiger pet octopus pet shark.

354
00:21:41,012 --> 00:21:48,856
Scott: There's very few animals that have not been turned into the pet of a human right probably like whale Sometimes ill-advisedly and usually only like.

355
00:21:48,997 --> 00:21:51,884
Scott: even somewhere like is you know is Shamu a pet?

356
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:57,867
Scott: it's SeaWorld and maybe right I don't know slave maybe but I guess no one's ever had like a blue whale as a pet.

357
00:21:57,887 --> 00:21:59,982
Scott: because like What are you gonna do?

358
00:22:00,688 --> 00:22:00,950
Scott: Right?

359
00:22:02,052 --> 00:22:03,598
Scott: Anyway, but here is a pet.

360
00:22:03,658 --> 00:22:10,759
Scott: that's a pretty common animal that you see a lot at least You know, I see them all the time But I've never heard of anyone having one as a pet.

361
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,526
Scott: and it's a crab.

362
00:22:12,546 --> 00:22:13,510
Scott: This guy's a pet crab.

363
00:22:13,871 --> 00:22:15,780
Rym: Oh, I know what videos you're talking about.

364
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,543
Scott: He's got pet crab.

365
00:22:16,644 --> 00:22:17,608
Scott: It's just like oh, it's a crab.

366
00:22:17,648 --> 00:22:18,010
Scott: That's nice.

367
00:22:18,231 --> 00:22:22,418
Scott: That's not a bad pet to have it's probably you know It can't be that hard to take care of.

368
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:23,523
Rym: is this the guy who is like?

369
00:22:23,683 --> 00:22:25,734
Rym: look how politely he's eating this banana Exactly.

370
00:22:25,795 --> 00:22:26,762
Scott: So he you know, it's like.

371
00:22:26,782 --> 00:22:27,890
Scott: what do you feed your pet crab?

372
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:28,272
Scott: It's like.

373
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:31,510
Scott: I guess you feed it the same fishy stuff it eats when it's in the ocean.

374
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:33,417
Scott: But I guess it eats banana.

375
00:22:33,457 --> 00:22:37,050
Scott: cuz I mean really what animal that has a mouth doesn't eat banana?

376
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:41,888
Scott: Yeah, I mean tell you you don't give everything from an ant to the monkey will eat a banana.

377
00:22:42,109 --> 00:22:44,321
Rym: rabbits Don't commonly encounter bananas in the wild.

378
00:22:44,341 --> 00:22:45,990
Rym: Let me tell you they like bananas, right?

379
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:48,869
Scott: Like an ant will eat a banana a bunny will eat a banana.

380
00:22:49,313 --> 00:22:54,850
Scott: Dogs leave banana dog lead a banana But depending on your dog, it might not be good at getting in how you present the banana to the cat.

381
00:22:54,991 --> 00:23:00,181
Scott: It might freak out like they do with cucumbers Yeah, but it's like there's a ton of animals that will all like.

382
00:23:00,221 --> 00:23:06,935
Scott: banana is like the closest thing you're gonna get to food that animals can eat right Almost regardless.

383
00:23:06,955 --> 00:23:10,535
Scott: like if you got a brand new animal you've never seen before and you're like I wonder what it eats.

384
00:23:10,877 --> 00:23:12,828
Scott: You can be pretty safe trying banana first.

385
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:17,923
Rym: That's maybe instead of sending the golden record out into space for aliens.

386
00:23:17,983 --> 00:23:20,090
Scott: It should be a banana, but then it would turn brown.

387
00:23:20,672 --> 00:23:21,394
Rym: It'll be in space.

388
00:23:21,434 --> 00:23:22,176
Rym: It'll be preserved.

389
00:23:22,337 --> 00:23:31,200
Scott: Whoa To protect him from From the disease and from oxidizing?

390
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,166
Rym: send one satellite up and then banana.

391
00:23:33,186 --> 00:23:34,270
Scott: then they'll be a ride.

392
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:38,309
Scott: Then they'll be a real Russian space travel cuz it's like well if you want to eat bananas, you gotta go to space.

393
00:23:39,493 --> 00:23:40,430
Scott: That's all the bananas.

394
00:23:41,055 --> 00:23:42,730
Rym: We put the good the Cavendish in space.

395
00:23:42,951 --> 00:23:49,469
Rym: It gets wiped out on earth and then all of humanity unites itself to go back into space and get those bananas back We'll have to grow them on Europa.

396
00:23:51,011 --> 00:23:53,179
Rym: So did you see those those geysers like?

397
00:23:53,219 --> 00:23:58,594
Scott: there's why they know listen don't go there, dude Structures are pretty simple.

398
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:09,998
Rym: Yeah, you know what if I'm pretty clear, it wasn't vague like maybe you shouldn't go there Scott I'm gonna translate those instructions do not go Settle all these worlds except Europa.

399
00:24:10,238 --> 00:24:12,245
Rym: There's something really fucking interesting here.

400
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:14,453
Rym: Come here first Don't.

401
00:24:14,493 --> 00:24:17,202
Scott: you can go in any of the doors in this dungeon except the secret door.

402
00:24:17,262 --> 00:24:21,429
Rym: go though in that one secret door off-limits Because there's great stuff in there guys.

403
00:24:21,619 --> 00:24:24,970
Scott: Yeah You know if I make a game the secret door just has instant death and there's no way around it.

404
00:24:25,553 --> 00:24:26,579
Scott: I'll teach you not to listen.

405
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:27,947
Scott: Anyway, it crashes the game.

406
00:24:28,148 --> 00:24:31,518
Scott: Sure So anyway, this guy's a pet crab.

407
00:24:31,558 --> 00:24:32,482
Scott: he feeds it a banana.

408
00:24:32,964 --> 00:24:33,969
Scott: and let me tell you something.

409
00:24:33,989 --> 00:24:43,229
Scott: I like having my dextrous fingers my digits, but Makes you really want to have a scissor built into your hand.

410
00:24:44,931 --> 00:24:46,758
Scott: It's really useful to have a scissor hand.

411
00:24:47,139 --> 00:24:48,725
Scott: if you're a crab there's a.

412
00:24:48,765 --> 00:24:50,090
Rym: there's a movie about the scissor hands.

413
00:24:50,431 --> 00:24:59,076
Scott: Yeah, no, but this crab you want like scissor finger the crab a crab claw is way more useful than whatever Edward scissor hands had Right that monstrosity.

414
00:24:59,116 --> 00:25:01,107
Rym: So whatever we know exactly what he had.

415
00:25:01,127 --> 00:25:04,719
Scott: he had scissors Yeah, her hands, but they weren't like nice clean scissors.

416
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,405
Scott: It was like a big mess of scissors and shit.

417
00:25:06,625 --> 00:25:09,734
Scott: Yeah, I'd rather have The crab claw.

418
00:25:09,855 --> 00:25:10,961
Rym: I wonder if that movie holds up.

419
00:25:11,002 --> 00:25:12,490
Rym: I have not seen it since I was a little kid.

420
00:25:12,591 --> 00:25:14,830
Scott: You know, I've also not seen it since I was a little kid and you know what?

421
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:15,796
Scott: I don't even know what the plot is.

422
00:25:15,836 --> 00:25:17,910
Scott: isn't the plot just as a scary guy with scissor hands?

423
00:25:18,272 --> 00:25:20,122
Scott: Actually nice who knows where he came from?

424
00:25:20,162 --> 00:25:23,198
Scott: he lives in a weird house and Cuts the shrubs nice.

425
00:25:23,218 --> 00:25:24,324
Rym: Well, you know where he came from.

426
00:25:24,344 --> 00:25:25,390
Rym: you get his whole back story.

427
00:25:25,611 --> 00:25:26,494
Scott: I forget I forget it.

428
00:25:26,514 --> 00:25:29,584
Rym: crater falls over dead when he was about to give him his new hands.

429
00:25:29,985 --> 00:25:31,370
Scott: Okay, I forget that part.

430
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:32,655
Rym: It's really about suburbia.

431
00:25:32,976 --> 00:25:33,659
Scott: Yeah, I know that.

432
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:36,630
Scott: Yeah, and then this girl comes and meets him.

433
00:25:38,091 --> 00:25:39,921
Rym: It's Frankenstein with scissor hands.

434
00:25:40,102 --> 00:25:40,404
Scott: Yeah.

435
00:25:40,524 --> 00:25:43,866
Scott: Yeah anyway, yeah We should watch it again.

436
00:25:44,854 --> 00:25:46,243
Rym: Me I remember really liking it.

437
00:25:46,264 --> 00:25:50,234
Rym: I mean Social media.

438
00:25:50,254 --> 00:25:54,687
Rym: I did not look into this but apparently Tim Burton said something really racist and everyone's done with him.

439
00:25:54,728 --> 00:25:57,255
Scott: now really That's that's news to me.

440
00:25:57,516 --> 00:25:59,281
Rym: I saw something about that.

441
00:25:59,622 --> 00:26:00,044
Scott: Okay.

442
00:26:00,084 --> 00:26:02,130
Scott: What did he say Tim Burton?

443
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:05,608
Scott: Was it something that was actually racist or was it something that just you know?

444
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,435
Scott: People think is racist was not?

445
00:26:07,576 --> 00:26:11,350
Rym: Tim Burton says something monumentally stupid about miss Peregrine's lack of diversity.

446
00:26:13,031 --> 00:26:15,699
Scott: He's basically like saying nowadays, this is Tim Burton.

447
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:22,379
Rym: nowadays people are talking about it more regarding diversity, but Things either call for things or they don't.

448
00:26:22,579 --> 00:26:27,720
Rym: I remember back when I was a child watching the Brady Bunch and they started to get All politically cracked like okay.

449
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,630
Rym: Let's have an Asian child and a black.

450
00:26:30,393 --> 00:26:37,519
Rym: I used to get more offended by that, but I just grew up watching blaxploitation, right and I said, it's great I didn't go like there should be more white people in these movies.

451
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,221
Scott: Uh-huh.

452
00:26:38,502 --> 00:26:39,164
Rym: That's what he said.

453
00:26:39,384 --> 00:26:40,729
Scott: Oh, he's clueless.

454
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:45,949
Rym: Yeah I think the key word is the wet the fact that he refers to and a black.

455
00:26:47,851 --> 00:26:49,605
Scott: Yeah, yeah How old is he?

456
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:54,054
Rym: Oldest I guess That's like 54.

457
00:26:54,054 --> 00:26:55,160
Scott: He's too old 55 old people.

458
00:26:58,275 --> 00:26:58,827
Scott: That's how they do.

459
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:03,915
Scott: Yeah, when you say you got to get rid of all the old people that includes the old people that you know made good Stuff, right?

460
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,689
Rym: What was the last good thing Tim Burton made?

461
00:27:06,312 --> 00:27:08,378
Scott: Another thing Tim Burton made good thing.

462
00:27:08,398 --> 00:27:11,990
Scott: Yeah, I haven't seen his recent stuff like his Willy Wonka and whatever.

463
00:27:12,253 --> 00:27:13,670
Rym: Yeah, I've been avoid.

464
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:17,710
Rym: I actually been avoiding a lot of his new stuff because they don't think I would enjoy them.

465
00:27:17,991 --> 00:27:19,618
Scott: I mean, they're like Nightmare Before Christmas.

466
00:27:20,281 --> 00:27:21,346
Rym: Yeah, that was a long time.

467
00:27:21,366 --> 00:27:22,290
Rym: I remember.

468
00:27:23,414 --> 00:27:25,985
Scott: But also Mars Attacks is like the worst thing ever.

469
00:27:26,086 --> 00:27:33,408
Rym: when we were at RIT I was at a mall with some people just randomly and someone pointed out that the Nightmare Before Christmas was 10 years old.

470
00:27:33,829 --> 00:27:37,253
Scott: then Yeah, I think it's like 20 years old It's really old.

471
00:27:37,876 --> 00:27:47,869
Rym: So I guess in the moment the book club book is Rebecca I'm gonna read it real soon because well, I guess I'll wait until Scott posted on the website then I'll start reading it.

472
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:48,291
Scott: Uh-huh.

473
00:27:48,653 --> 00:27:50,684
Rym: Yeah, it looks like it's pretty short.

474
00:27:50,724 --> 00:27:51,950
Rym: It's way shorter than that Nazi book.

475
00:27:52,011 --> 00:27:53,469
Scott: I don't know how long it is cuz I have it on a kid.

476
00:27:54,071 --> 00:27:58,388
Rym: So I'd look the number of dots it showed next to it in my Kindle compared to the man doesn't have dots.

477
00:27:58,428 --> 00:27:58,910
Scott: It has a bar.

478
00:27:59,831 --> 00:28:02,939
Rym: Wow You just have like an old Kindle OS sir.

479
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:05,550
Scott: I'm just using a really old Kindle cuz why replace it?

480
00:28:06,191 --> 00:28:11,267
Rym: I only replaced my old one because the paper white mine doesn't even have a blacklight backlight.

481
00:28:11,508 --> 00:28:14,277
Rym: Ah The backlight is key.

482
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,670
Scott: Yeah black lights nice, but I'm not gonna buy a new Kindle.

483
00:28:16,751 --> 00:28:17,335
Scott: Just get a backlight.

484
00:28:17,376 --> 00:28:18,545
Scott: I can use my iPad if I want that.

485
00:28:18,565 --> 00:28:20,838
Rym: Yeah Well, the new new Kindle is also way better.

486
00:28:20,858 --> 00:28:22,345
Scott: I guess what I mean, it's not better than an iPad.

487
00:28:22,928 --> 00:28:25,315
Rym: Yeah Well, I would say it is.

488
00:28:25,415 --> 00:28:29,449
Rym: I prefer reading text on a Kindle with the paper white to any tablet.

489
00:28:30,812 --> 00:28:32,509
Rym: Sure, but only if it's like book text.

490
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:36,667
Scott: But if I need a light, I'm not gonna buy a separate thing when I have.

491
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:37,851
Scott: you know It's just.

492
00:28:37,932 --> 00:28:39,617
Rym: it makes the reading more pleasant.

493
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:41,002
Rym: Even if you're in good light.

494
00:28:41,182 --> 00:28:42,928
Scott: Let me tell you retina screen fonts look pretty good.

495
00:28:42,948 --> 00:28:46,717
Rym: No but otherwise, I guess the patreon is going.

496
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:54,201
Rym: the only thing I'll say about the patreon is that I am reading the entirety of FX 9's Castlevania 2 Simon's Quest.

497
00:28:54,643 --> 00:28:56,350
Scott: you should pay to make him not do that.

498
00:28:57,153 --> 00:28:58,718
Rym: I've read two chapters so far.

499
00:28:58,738 --> 00:29:01,347
Rym: the insights they are from chapter 1. are that Tim?

500
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:07,607
Rym: I think wants to have sex with his mom and that he is also sexually aroused by chocolate?

501
00:29:08,008 --> 00:29:12,922
Rym: chapter 2 I don't even know what to say about these books.

502
00:29:13,023 --> 00:29:14,610
Rym: like reading him as an adult.

503
00:29:16,693 --> 00:29:17,679
Rym: I just don't know what to say.

504
00:29:17,699 --> 00:29:25,290
Scott: I can give you plenty of more books from my childhood Some good and some Castlevania, but that is one of the things I'm gonna start doing in the world.

505
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:29,048
Rym: I am doing in the patreon is I'm just gonna read old possibly bad books to you.

506
00:29:30,571 --> 00:29:31,374
Scott: All right.

507
00:29:31,535 --> 00:29:32,979
Scott: I will read good books for free.

508
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:38,237
Rym: then to counter you I guess page I mean a copyright is dubious there.

509
00:29:38,257 --> 00:29:39,723
Rym: I guess I'm giving my take on it.

510
00:29:39,823 --> 00:29:40,104
Rym: Also.

511
00:29:40,164 --> 00:29:41,830
Scott: I'm good books from project Gutenberg.

512
00:29:42,092 --> 00:29:42,997
Rym: Yeah, that's the way to go.

513
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:43,903
Rym: Why don't we do it?

514
00:29:43,943 --> 00:29:44,064
Rym: Do it?

515
00:29:44,084 --> 00:29:44,949
Rym: Why don't we both pick?

516
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:50,099
Rym: open and open Creative Commons or Public domain book and just read them?

517
00:29:50,199 --> 00:29:50,983
Rym: start doing audiobooks.

518
00:29:51,305 --> 00:29:52,210
Scott: cuz I don't got time for that.

519
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,599
Scott: I'm doing too much other shit your short stuff.

520
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:55,330
Scott: What's short Rebecca?

521
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,474
Scott: It's not public domain.

522
00:29:57,575 --> 00:29:58,358
Rym: No, but it's short.

523
00:29:58,699 --> 00:30:01,208
Rym: I can't imagine we'd be sued if we read to Rebecca out loud.

524
00:30:01,268 --> 00:30:01,630
Scott: Who knows?

525
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:08,930
Rym: Yeah So road trips something I don't do anymore.

526
00:30:09,571 --> 00:30:14,714
Rym: Yeah, like they used to be a bigger part of my life and I already realized thinking about the show I'm pretty.

527
00:30:14,734 --> 00:30:15,622
Scott: have we done this before?

528
00:30:15,642 --> 00:30:16,530
Scott: I feel like we've discussed it.

529
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:19,550
Rym: So I did some cursory searching and couldn't find anything.

530
00:30:19,711 --> 00:30:22,000
Scott: I feel like we've discussed and I feel like discussed.

531
00:30:22,322 --> 00:30:24,310
Scott: every anecdote we're gonna use has been reused.

532
00:30:24,452 --> 00:30:25,769
Rym: So what is the definition of a road trip?

533
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:57,946
Rym: Cuz I already realized that I can come up with like four tiers of what might be considered a road trip And I feel like the definition at this point has to be something Either the trip itself has to be a looked forward to component of the greater trip like You like you're doing it as a road trip on purpose and you're looking forward to the travel and the destination not just the destination or It has to be more than one day on the road Like you got to stop at a motel somewhere or it doesn't count.

534
00:30:58,368 --> 00:31:01,262
Rym: Mmm Do you have an alternate definition for me or do you think that can?

535
00:31:01,282 --> 00:31:09,681
Scott: well I think there's some people that would argue Right, like for example, we drove to Florida That's my biggest road trip maybe once or twice, right?

536
00:31:09,722 --> 00:31:11,770
Scott: So, you know, it's like it's a trip.

537
00:31:12,432 --> 00:31:16,790
Scott: It's on the road and it takes a while with the stop at least one night if not two.

538
00:31:16,931 --> 00:31:24,730
Scott: so it's a. you know, it counts as a road trip, but You know, I think some people would argue like that's not a real road trip.

539
00:31:24,811 --> 00:31:32,090
Scott: Right, like a real road trip is like you're not driving to somewhere You're just driving like, you know Kerouac on the road and whatnot.

540
00:31:32,371 --> 00:31:37,750
Rym: Yeah, but even then when people say road trip, it's usually in the context of we have a destination.

541
00:31:37,891 --> 00:31:41,228
Rym: That's just an excuse and really we're looking forward to being on the road.

542
00:31:43,571 --> 00:31:50,430
Scott: People driving, you know on a trip for the sake of the traveling driving part versus the destination part.

543
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:52,890
Scott: We just happen to be using a car and it happens to take a while.

544
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:58,510
Scott: Yep, but I also kind of lump into this, you know, they're actually never done the road trip just for the sake of driving.

545
00:31:58,611 --> 00:31:59,638
Scott: It's always been to go somewhere.

546
00:31:59,658 --> 00:32:03,420
Rym: So the times I did that I The destination was.

547
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,220
Rym: I ended up back home Like me and a couple of friends were just like one day.

548
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:11,634
Rym: we were like, let's just drive north until we get bored Not on the highway.

549
00:32:11,674 --> 00:32:17,237
Rym: We just got on like Shainer and drove because in Michigan, you know, there's mile roads Like every mile away from Detroit.

550
00:32:17,418 --> 00:32:18,604
Rym: It's like 19 mile 20 mile 21 mile.

551
00:32:20,232 --> 00:32:22,886
Rym: So we just decided cuz you know, this is way before smartphones.

552
00:32:22,966 --> 00:32:23,670
Rym: We didn't really plan.

553
00:32:24,232 --> 00:32:28,450
Rym: We just drove north until we got bored, but it's not like across the country.

554
00:32:28,912 --> 00:32:33,904
Rym: No, we spent like seven or eight hours in the road, but we just drove north We were bored and we turned around and drove back south.

555
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:37,987
Rym: Hmm One time I drove down to Florida for the fuck of it.

556
00:32:39,093 --> 00:32:40,770
Rym: Did that a lot of times going to beaches?

557
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:53,789
Rym: But most of the road trips I had were either the family drove all the way to Florida But we stopped along the way at minor attractions that themselves would not be worth a trip But are worth the trip if you're on the way somewhere else.

558
00:32:54,171 --> 00:33:08,069
Scott: Well, I mean there's plenty of like things that have been set up intentionally along high traffic routes such as I-95 from you know northeast down to Florida right or you know anywhere towards.

559
00:33:08,089 --> 00:33:13,240
Scott: you know If you go to like a major Attraction like say a Mount Rushmore or Grand Canyon.

560
00:33:13,621 --> 00:33:18,699
Scott: all the major roads leading in and out of it are like high Traffic for like even didn't eat.

561
00:33:18,739 --> 00:33:21,894
Rym: there's a bunch of garbage on the highway Hundred miles.

562
00:33:22,014 --> 00:33:26,228
Scott: like if you know that there's this attraction that people are going to and it's like they can't people.

563
00:33:26,248 --> 00:33:29,690
Scott: even if people are Visiting it by flying they can't land right next to it.

564
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:36,136
Scott: They got to go it's like the nearest city and then drive to it because it's a middle-of-nowhere Attraction because the United States is large.

565
00:33:36,477 --> 00:34:00,820
Scott: therefore they have to use a car to get to it and they're gonna likely come down this Road so you put some business on that road that will specifically cater to someone on vacation such as souvenir garbage or something that's a minor attraction like a go-kart track or a water slide or a haunted house or for you know Something mysterious like a Mystery Shack, right?

566
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,424
Scott: Yeah this sort of thing.

567
00:34:02,444 --> 00:34:02,946
Rym: Maybe that's it.

568
00:34:03,066 --> 00:34:03,768
Rym: It's it's you.

569
00:34:03,828 --> 00:34:08,510
Rym: it has to be Multi-destination trip like there are stops on purpose, right?

570
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:13,395
Scott: Like if you're in a hurry just to get there and like that's all you want to do You're stopping.

571
00:34:13,455 --> 00:34:15,321
Scott: places isn't gonna happen and you're just gonna.

572
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,545
Scott: you know, it's not a road trip.

573
00:34:16,565 --> 00:34:18,250
Scott: You're just going through the place, right?

574
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:22,762
Scott: It's not a road trip to go to the grocery store Even if you have to stop at the dry cleaners in the way there.

575
00:34:22,802 --> 00:34:23,746
Rym: now what is real interesting?

576
00:34:23,786 --> 00:34:32,120
Rym: those I was thinking about This when I think of the old days when we would drive to conventions from like RIT or Beacon I felt like like.

577
00:34:32,141 --> 00:34:35,609
Rym: those felt like road trips Like I feel like I would have called them road trips, but they weren't that long.

578
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:38,565
Rym: They're like six seven hours tops depending on where we were going.

579
00:34:38,605 --> 00:34:45,489
Rym: Yeah, sometimes five Yeah but in the modern era like now if I take a road trip in a car somewhere I would never call it a road trip.

580
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:56,543
Rym: and the only difference between those trips and these trips are that we put a bunch of people in the car usually and We didn't have smartphones and we had to plan the trip very carefully.

581
00:34:56,864 --> 00:35:00,036
Rym: Like we'd bring snacks We'd put shit in the car.

582
00:35:00,297 --> 00:35:01,140
Rym: We'd print maps.

583
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:11,604
Rym: There was all this like weird extra preparation and Nowadays, literally I just get in the car and go and if we get hungry along the way I literally just look at the smartphone and figure out where to stop.

584
00:35:12,168 --> 00:35:17,209
Scott: Yeah Yeah, the smartphone really destroyed a lot of the things that the road trip was about.

585
00:35:17,249 --> 00:35:18,053
Scott: right It's like you're not.

586
00:35:18,395 --> 00:35:20,044
Scott: you don't have to get off and explore.

587
00:35:20,104 --> 00:35:23,743
Scott: You don't have to like, you know If you have a paper map, it's like you think oh you shouldn't get lost.

588
00:35:23,763 --> 00:35:26,494
Scott: if you're good at reading the paper map Well, let's say you're perfect at it.

589
00:35:26,514 --> 00:35:29,002
Scott: Like I am like you shouldn't ever fuck up.

590
00:35:29,082 --> 00:35:33,457
Scott: But the thing is roads change Yeah, and maps don't.

591
00:35:33,518 --> 00:35:33,718
Scott: like.

592
00:35:33,959 --> 00:35:39,238
Rym: half of us fucking up on all these road trips Like you and me both is literally guys.

593
00:35:39,259 --> 00:35:40,905
Rym: We're fucking running out of gas.

594
00:35:41,206 --> 00:35:42,410
Rym: It's like midnight.

595
00:35:43,012 --> 00:35:44,229
Rym: Where's the gas station?

596
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:46,255
Scott: Right and the maps don't help you with that.

597
00:35:46,275 --> 00:35:51,674
Scott: like paper maps are flawed in many ways no matter how good or highly skilled You are right.

598
00:35:51,795 --> 00:36:04,903
Scott: So like they in the era before the smartphone and the GPS and whatnot It's like things just get driving for that long a distance inherently had things that would and could go wrong that you would have to deal with.

599
00:36:04,923 --> 00:36:09,538
Rym: which sort of meant road trips if forget the Other definition just naturally adventurous.

600
00:36:09,558 --> 00:36:13,632
Rym: Yeah, no matter what they encompass preparation and Adventure.

601
00:36:13,652 --> 00:36:16,139
Scott: but now now everyone has magic swords.

602
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,867
Scott: So no monsters really gonna stand in your way.

603
00:36:18,947 --> 00:36:21,438
Scott: It's like there's no Adventurousness whatsoever.

604
00:36:21,478 --> 00:36:22,302
Scott: It's like you're getting.

605
00:36:22,363 --> 00:36:25,657
Scott: it's a guaranteed perfect trip Even if my phone stops working.

606
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:29,590
Rym: everyone else in the car also has a smartphone and you can recharge the phone, you know.

607
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:32,700
Scott: It's like there's just so many ways you cannot get fucked over.

608
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,010
Rym: and also I don't ever drive on non freeways anymore.

609
00:36:36,535 --> 00:36:37,869
Rym: Nor do I ever try to take short.

610
00:36:37,909 --> 00:36:39,055
Scott: well And this isn't even counting.

611
00:36:39,075 --> 00:36:44,570
Scott: like all the improvements in cars and highways themselves We'll be getting all the money that should have been spent on trains.

612
00:36:44,791 --> 00:36:55,958
Rym: I mean I had road trips like fancy rest stops everywhere now like one time I was gonna visit my mom when she'd moved way out of the desert and Like I didn't do any prep because I've been so used to the smartphone era So there was.

613
00:36:55,998 --> 00:37:11,070
Rym: I was gonna fly to Phoenix Rent a car and drive hours out into the desert to find her house by which I had a vague address That didn't really like work and a vague set of directions and I was driving like a hundred miles.

614
00:37:12,131 --> 00:37:14,784
Rym: But I flew there and land I get in the rental car.

615
00:37:15,065 --> 00:37:16,190
Rym: I opened my smartphone.

616
00:37:17,231 --> 00:37:21,002
Rym: No service like no data service at all.

617
00:37:21,363 --> 00:37:23,950
Rym: I have no maps and I just winged it.

618
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:26,339
Rym: I just drove out into the desert and I only.

619
00:37:26,379 --> 00:37:28,467
Rym: I probably added about 40 miles to the trip.

620
00:37:28,728 --> 00:37:34,750
Rym: just you know Dead reckoning with a couple of printed maps I found in the car, but our bought at a gas station.

621
00:37:35,354 --> 00:37:37,630
Rym: But I totally made it and it was a like it was an adventure.

622
00:37:38,112 --> 00:37:41,905
Rym: So that turned into a road trip because adventure was injected into it.

623
00:37:41,925 --> 00:37:43,410
Rym: that would have not otherwise occurred.

624
00:37:43,812 --> 00:37:45,239
Scott: Yeah, the other thing is like a lot of thing.

625
00:37:45,279 --> 00:37:50,790
Scott: if you watch or read, you know romanticized road trip kind of stories or movies or whatever.

626
00:37:51,132 --> 00:37:57,186
Scott: There are things that happen in them that No longer happen in the real car breaks down and you have no way to get help.

627
00:37:57,226 --> 00:38:03,845
Scott: that doesn't happen anymore Right, or you know hitchhikers that aren't peep that are people you should actually let in your car.

628
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:06,673
Scott: Yeah, or you hitchhike Right.

629
00:38:07,075 --> 00:38:08,221
Scott: No, that does not happen.

630
00:38:08,463 --> 00:38:09,568
Rym: I have hitchhiked.

631
00:38:11,476 --> 00:38:11,920
Scott: Pick you up.

632
00:38:12,505 --> 00:38:17,884
Rym: I was picked up By a scary person in Michigan or a normal person normal ish person.

633
00:38:18,286 --> 00:38:18,627
Scott: Okay.

634
00:38:18,908 --> 00:38:21,740
Rym: Yeah There's nothing happened in the story.

635
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,770
Scott: I literally just they just took you where you wanted to go.

636
00:38:23,991 --> 00:38:25,719
Rym: I was my bike like I was by.

637
00:38:25,759 --> 00:38:31,263
Rym: I biked just way fucking away from my house And then my bike broke in a way that I could not easily fix.

638
00:38:31,805 --> 00:38:32,286
Rym: and I was a little.

639
00:38:32,307 --> 00:38:33,230
Rym: I was a little kid.

640
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:35,196
Rym: I was in high school like 17.

641
00:38:35,196 --> 00:38:37,965
Rym: I have I don't have a cell phone on me.

642
00:38:38,166 --> 00:38:39,269
Rym: No, I have no did.

643
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:40,213
Scott: How big would it be?

644
00:38:40,374 --> 00:38:43,990
Rym: Yeah, I've got like four bucks on me in cash.

645
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:47,277
Rym: I'm 40 or 50 miles away from home.

646
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:48,521
Rym: What am I gonna do?

647
00:38:48,581 --> 00:38:49,926
Rym: It's Michigan at night.

648
00:38:49,986 --> 00:38:51,070
Rym: Like there's no mass transit.

649
00:38:51,694 --> 00:38:59,670
Rym: So I'm just walking down the road Kind of like waving in any car that goes by and eventually a car slowed down and it was some high school kids.

650
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:02,910
Rym: I didn't know them but they were high school kids and they were like, what's up?

651
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:07,847
Rym: And I told him the story and they were like we're heading that way We'll drop you off and they drove me like 30 of the miles I needed to get.

652
00:39:07,867 --> 00:39:09,475
Rym: hmm And that was it though.

653
00:39:09,495 --> 00:39:17,910
Scott: I hitchhiked totally fine, you know, I don't want to retread the same material But I was just thinking more about like, you know things that were like we did every time we drove a long distance.

654
00:39:17,952 --> 00:39:23,967
Scott: Yeah And I realized the smartphone has done a lot more to ruin the road trip than just provide really good maps.

655
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:25,010
Scott: that yeah in real time.

656
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:38,926
Scott: So for example, right we used to have to stop to use a payphone and call someone or like a long trip in school and like on a coach bus that stopped somewhere everyone to Get off and use the payphones to call their family or whatever

657
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:46,608
Rym: or like, you know If you have multiple cars on the road trip Like you'd have to coordinate all the stops and then like share information about the next leg of the trip,

658
00:39:46,889 --> 00:39:47,070
Scott: right?

659
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:54,690
Scott: So, you know, so another thing we used to always stop and there's certain things that we would get to entertain ourselves in the car.

660
00:39:54,810 --> 00:40:00,590
Rym: Yeah, I used to make mix CDs on purpose like we'd make like here's the music we were bringing on this trip.

661
00:40:00,751 --> 00:40:02,642
Scott: But we need entertainment, but we would also.

662
00:40:02,662 --> 00:40:08,521
Scott: for example Tiger LCD games and portable video games are hot.

663
00:40:08,682 --> 00:40:10,830
Rym: Yeah, but when we got a game my brother had a game boy.

664
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:11,736
Rym: I had a game gear.

665
00:40:11,877 --> 00:40:12,320
Scott: there were these.

666
00:40:12,421 --> 00:40:14,352
Scott: I haven't seen one of these in a while But they're.

667
00:40:14,372 --> 00:40:15,275
Scott: they might still make them.

668
00:40:15,436 --> 00:40:19,470
Scott: these books called yes and no and you have a magic pen that has like invisible review.

669
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:25,930
Scott: I remember those revealing ink and you could play different games in this book by drawing with the magic.

670
00:40:27,232 --> 00:40:32,124
Rym: We had a box full of hundreds of those little plastic not even video games.

671
00:40:32,144 --> 00:40:34,772
Rym: that had steel ball bearings in them and various feats Of skill.

672
00:40:34,852 --> 00:40:35,515
Scott: Yeah, those are good.

673
00:40:35,676 --> 00:40:39,070
Rym: Yeah, we had like this giant box of them that we'd bring on road trips.

674
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:44,971
Scott: You know, you could play games like looking outside the car window like how many blue cars you see or whatever I mean.

675
00:40:44,991 --> 00:40:47,643
Rym: nowadays we're like someone's in the back of the car.

676
00:40:47,683 --> 00:40:49,190
Rym: Just like watching a movie on their phone.

677
00:40:49,652 --> 00:40:52,182
Rym: I'm just like listening to music right there be we have.

678
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:54,810
Scott: we had little board games that were portable He had like magnets.

679
00:40:54,991 --> 00:41:00,512
Scott: We had battleship that was like in two little plastic things and you would just unfold your little battleship in front of you and hide It.

680
00:41:00,836 --> 00:41:01,970
Scott: it was like a little plastic thing.

681
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:05,268
Scott: It just unfolded into an L shape and the other person had one too.

682
00:41:05,932 --> 00:41:09,250
Scott: You play battleship for reals just as good as the full board game.

683
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:14,970
Rym: We also like snacks - like we would very specifically like fill the car with snacks and beverages and stuff.

684
00:41:15,211 --> 00:41:26,017
Rym: And now because like we couldn't know where we might be able to stop along the way now one There's rest stops because I don't go places where there aren't rest stops really and - I can just look at my phone and be Like, okay, there's a town up ahead.

685
00:41:26,057 --> 00:41:26,478
Rym: We don't like.

686
00:41:26,539 --> 00:41:30,935
Scott: the only thing that's the same as it ever was that you got to stop To pee and poo.

687
00:41:31,297 --> 00:41:41,330
Rym: Oh, so when I used to drive long distances by myself One of my main goals was to minimize my time on the road by never stopping if at all possible.

688
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:47,578
Rym: Mmm, so I would always make that drive from Rochester to Detroit Never stopping if I could get away with it.

689
00:41:48,301 --> 00:41:53,884
Rym: and at one point I thought you know What the only thing that makes me stop on this trip is.

690
00:41:53,904 --> 00:41:58,605
Rym: I got a pee at some point So I tried to pee in a jug while driving.

691
00:41:58,645 --> 00:41:59,349
Scott: you get pee all over.

692
00:41:59,369 --> 00:41:59,931
Scott: now You know what?

693
00:41:59,951 --> 00:42:03,443
Rym: I learned my don't piss your pants because you're dreaming.

694
00:42:03,684 --> 00:42:06,275
Rym: instinct is so powerful You couldn't pee.

695
00:42:06,477 --> 00:42:11,829
Rym: I cannot pee if I'm not in front of a toilet Hmm, or if I'm not like in front of a tree or something like in a car.

696
00:42:12,332 --> 00:42:16,755
Rym: My brain was like you might be dreaming you just nope I haven't said.

697
00:42:16,836 --> 00:42:25,010
Scott: I have something similar right if I walk into a bathroom Even if I just peed recently like you gotta pay and I was just going to wash my hands Pavlok's pee.

698
00:42:25,412 --> 00:42:26,823
Scott: Yep Pavlok's pee.

699
00:42:27,105 --> 00:42:32,590
Scott: it make my Wants to come out even if there's like a drop, but if I didn't go in that bathroom, that wouldn't happen.

700
00:42:32,855 --> 00:42:40,510
Rym: But also, you know The point of injection was say you're traveling and something weird happens like we need to find a bathroom and there's no rest stops.

701
00:42:41,311 --> 00:42:45,949
Rym: You've got to go off of the path from the triple-a triptychs that you brought with you a trip.

702
00:42:45,989 --> 00:42:54,990
Rym: take Yeah, you've got to go off the path into dragon land Accomplish your mission and then return to the fabled highway.

703
00:42:55,492 --> 00:42:57,020
Rym: That was always the source of adventure.

704
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:03,290
Rym: now that literally never happens ever Nope, and if it does smartphone just tells you exactly how to get back to the freeway.

705
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:05,850
Rym: Do you have any times I got stuck on a service road and?

706
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:09,649
Rym: Literally could not figure out how to get back on a highway like in the old days.

707
00:43:10,352 --> 00:43:20,549
Scott: I also think that like because less people are road tripping and more people are smartphoning Right is like even if you tried to road trip because less people are doing it.

708
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:27,350
Scott: the places that appeal to the road trip person right those attractions and things have decreased in quantity.

709
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:32,830
Scott: Right as less people drive more people fly more people smartphone get where they're going.

710
00:43:34,635 --> 00:43:40,451
Scott: You know people are taking a certain route because the smartphone says it's better and your attraction is on a different route that people used to take.

711
00:43:40,491 --> 00:43:41,294
Scott: and now you're out of business.

712
00:43:41,435 --> 00:43:49,330
Rym: a proper like full-on road trip with the rule of like staying in a Motel when you're too tired to keep driving like that kind of nonsense.

713
00:43:49,913 --> 00:43:52,789
Rym: Those were always with family over the course of like a week or two.

714
00:43:53,171 --> 00:43:56,444
Scott: Well, the real strategy is one person sleeps or one person drives.

715
00:43:56,464 --> 00:43:58,030
Scott: Do you swaps you never to stop driving?

716
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:00,638
Rym: We did that drive into a Jeep Jamboree in Virginia.

717
00:44:00,999 --> 00:44:03,125
Rym: We went non-stop all the way there.

718
00:44:03,266 --> 00:44:04,570
Rym: two drivers going in shifts.

719
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:06,034
Rym: Yeah, it was real good time.

720
00:44:06,074 --> 00:44:07,398
Scott: three drivers even better cuz.

721
00:44:07,418 --> 00:44:11,490
Rym: yeah, you know, I remember going to anime central in Chicago.

722
00:44:11,632 --> 00:44:12,790
Rym: That was a fucking disaster.

723
00:44:13,071 --> 00:44:17,070
Rym: That was such a long drive and the car broke down along the way and those back when I was poor.

724
00:44:17,492 --> 00:44:20,909
Rym: So I could not afford to pay the mechanic to fix it.

725
00:44:21,211 --> 00:44:27,590
Rym: So I wrote him a check and then I withdrew enough money from my bank account to make sure the rent check would bounce.

726
00:44:27,671 --> 00:44:29,347
Rym: So the check to the mechanic wouldn't bounce.

727
00:44:30,872 --> 00:44:33,210
Rym: That was that was an adventure that couldn't happen nowadays.

728
00:44:33,331 --> 00:44:33,694
Scott: But I didn't.

729
00:44:33,714 --> 00:44:39,409
Rym: you bounce the mechanic and not the rent Because I felt bad for the mechanic as he was doing real work and the rent was to RIT.

730
00:44:40,892 --> 00:44:47,764
Rym: You could bounce rent like four times to RIT before they really started yelling at you because they're like, whatever We'll just add it to your student loan debt.

731
00:44:47,946 --> 00:45:03,490
Rym: Sure So that yeah, but like all those mini adventures The only other thing that can still inject adventure today is not having money Because the only other reason you do a big road trip unless you're going with your family like for us to save monies.

732
00:45:03,636 --> 00:45:09,990
Scott: Yeah Cuz if you already own a car because you live in the suburbs and you have to own it Yeah, the cost of the car is basically zero.

733
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:13,993
Scott: It's only the cost of the gas and any place you sleep Alright.

734
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:18,210
Rym: and guys who tell like motels on a highway so cheap not expense, right?

735
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:29,810
Scott: So, you know the cost of driving to Florida say or even to California is so much less than the cost of flying there Even though flights are if your time means nothing and you already own a car, right?

736
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:33,910
Scott: If you have more time you the car effectively cost nothing because you have it already.

737
00:45:34,594 --> 00:45:36,650
Scott: Then road trip save you a ton of money.

738
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:41,590
Rym: But also now gas got cheap which means driving is cheap, but it also means flying is cheap.

739
00:45:41,791 --> 00:45:44,079
Scott: It might be slightly less cheap in the future.

740
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:47,050
Rym: It's 1,500 bucks for me to fly a round trip to Sydney.

741
00:45:47,191 --> 00:45:50,790
Scott: I mean, I mean, I mean I mean gas might be slightly less cheap in the near future.

742
00:45:50,911 --> 00:45:52,377
Rym: Oh, yeah, but it's even still.

743
00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:53,924
Rym: it's pretty historically low right now.

744
00:45:54,045 --> 00:45:55,635
Scott: Yes, but I'm saying it's around soon.

745
00:45:57,572 --> 00:45:58,233
Rym: The only like.

746
00:45:58,414 --> 00:46:03,626
Rym: basically my rule is I would never drive somewhere that is not within like six hour.

747
00:46:03,687 --> 00:46:05,130
Rym: drive tops beyond that flying.

748
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:06,294
Rym: Why would you ever drive that far?

749
00:46:06,475 --> 00:46:10,890
Scott: Yeah driving to Florida from New York takes like a day plus you can fly.

750
00:46:11,930 --> 00:46:19,250
Scott: Flying there takes like 90 minutes and even if you count the time with dealing with the TSA or whatever, it's like that doesn't even matter.

751
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:21,281
Scott: Oh, no, now it takes three hours big deal.

752
00:46:21,401 --> 00:46:26,271
Scott: Yeah, it's so fast Like I'll 500 miles an hour versus 60.

753
00:46:26,271 --> 00:46:28,430
Scott: It's like it's not even close like when I lived in Rochester.

754
00:46:28,611 --> 00:46:33,330
Rym: The only reason I did all those road trips driving to Michigan was because I didn't have any money.

755
00:46:33,751 --> 00:46:35,519
Rym: I had any money I would have flown every time.

756
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:41,553
Scott: Yeah, I mean I flew back to New York from Rochester Like a 45-minute flight and it cost like $75.

757
00:46:41,553 --> 00:46:46,168
Rym: that flight is like they are cheese like they say alright, you can take off your seatbelts.

758
00:46:46,348 --> 00:46:48,469
Rym: two minutes later They're like, alright, we're making our descent.

759
00:46:49,654 --> 00:46:50,884
Rym: It's like the aerobics playing.

760
00:46:51,045 --> 00:46:52,736
Scott: pretty much It's great.

761
00:46:53,038 --> 00:46:58,580
Rym: Yeah, so I think just Money and modernity killed the road trip.

762
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:02,350
Scott: I think the road trip will have a slight comeback with the self-driving car.

763
00:47:02,531 --> 00:47:07,230
Scott: Yeah, dude, because now everyone's got the self-driving car can enjoy themselves.

764
00:47:07,330 --> 00:47:08,655
Scott: You don't need to have someone driving.

765
00:47:08,836 --> 00:47:09,117
