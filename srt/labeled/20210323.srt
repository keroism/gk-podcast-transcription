1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,527
Rym: It's Tuesday, March 23rd, 2021.

2
00:00:09,527 --> 00:00:09,849
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:13,580
Scott: And I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:14,984
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,025 --> 00:00:18,659
Rym: Tonight, we are reviewing a game you might have heard of called Golf.

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,558
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:21,101 --> 00:00:24,552
Rym: So, now that it's warm again, I'm going outside again.

8
00:00:24,612 --> 00:00:27,019
Rym: Like, I ran a half marathon the other day.

9
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:28,665
Rym: But, I had a situation.

10
00:00:28,705 --> 00:00:39,540
Rym: I assumed I'd be slower, 'cause over the winter, as much as I have a spin bike, and ring fit, and it is possible to exercise indoors, even in the COVID environment, even if I can't use the treadmill.

11
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,100
Rym: The reality is, I didn't do it as much as I wanted to all winter.

12
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,320
Scott: Oh, I biked on my stationary bike very frequently.

13
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,383
Rym: I did it frequently.

14
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:48,045
Rym: I did it a lot.

15
00:00:48,105 --> 00:00:52,260
Rym: But I did not maintain the level of activity I maintained the other three seasons.

16
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,559
Rym: 'Cause I've never in my life maintained that level.

17
00:00:56,684 --> 00:01:05,660
Scott: This is actually an improvement versus the... Because, before, I used to just lay on the couch in the winter, and now, I didn't lay on the couch in the winter.

18
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,720
Scott: And now it's gonna be warm, and I'll probably put it away when it's warm, right?

19
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,280
Scott: Or at least, it depends if I commute to work or not.

20
00:01:15,281 --> 00:01:20,760
Scott: And then bring it back out when it's cold again, even when times are normal-ish again.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,760
Rym: So, over the weekend, it was really warm, so I ran a half marathon, and I put on my Fitbit, so I could track my heart rate, and I did my whole thing.

22
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,760
Rym: And sometimes, the Fitbit will fuck up, or Strava will fuck up, my phone will fuck up.

23
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:41,310
Rym: Like, it doesn't happen that often, but every now and then, like, the GPS will get messed up, and it's usually really obvious, 'cause I'll be in the middle of the run, and I look to see my pace, and it says, like, "You're running one minute miles,".

24
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,119
Rym: and I'm like, "Nah, it's

25
00:01:43,179 --> 00:01:43,380
Rym: busted.".

26
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,259
Scott: That seems wrong.

27
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:51,720
Rym: So, on this run, the GPS messed up in the most fascinating way possible.

28
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:59,860
Rym: The numbers it was showing me were plausible, like, at, like, the distance run, everything was really plausible.

29
00:02:00,701 --> 00:02:21,520
Rym: But it was showing that I was running, like, nine and a half to ten minute miles, but, like, it lined up pretty well, especially because when I sped up my pace, it seemed to get better, and kind of track, and there's physical milestones along the way, and I hit a physical milestone at one point, and the mileage was only, like, a quarter mile off, and that wasn't that bad.

30
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:31,540
Rym: So, basically, the data was plausible enough to where I was using that pace information to pace myself, and I had planned to run a relatively slow half-marathon, just, like, for funsies.

31
00:02:32,842 --> 00:02:48,639
Rym: But because I seemed to be going so slow compared to what I expected, I started running faster, and faster, and faster, and taking a more and more aggressive pace to try to, like, catch up to my baseline, and I was starting to think about, "Oh, did I really not work out that much over the

32
00:02:48,699 --> 00:02:48,920
Rym: winter?".

33
00:02:49,641 --> 00:03:04,860
Rym: And then I finally get to the end, and only then do I discover that not only had the Fitbit fucked up in this, like, odd way where the numbers were plausible, but based on the physical distance I knew I ran, because I run the same distance every time, I know where the finish line is on the half.

34
00:03:05,842 --> 00:03:14,300
Rym: I got to the finish line, and it was the third fastest half-marathon I've ever run, because I was pushing myself and running harder because I thought I was just out of shape and running slow.

35
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,118
Rym: The moral is, I could have been pushing myself harder this whole time, and I just wasn't.

36
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:26,398
Scott: I biked up, I virtually biked up a 3,000-foot mountain that doesn't exist in the real world at all.

37
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,544
Scott: It took about two hours.

38
00:03:28,785 --> 00:03:36,288
Scott: Out of the 200-something people, two to three hundred people that did it recently, I was, like, the eighth slowest, so not the slowest.

39
00:03:37,472 --> 00:03:38,916
Scott: I just casually went up, like,

40
00:03:38,936 --> 00:03:39,999
Scott: "Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.".

41
00:03:40,441 --> 00:03:41,848
Scott: They put a lot of cool stuff up there.

42
00:03:41,948 --> 00:03:54,814
Scott: There's, like, when you get to the top, there's, like, a big statue, and there's, like, a yeti, and there's castles, and then when you get to the top, you get to virtually bike down, which you can't do because there's no way to start at the top.

43
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,059
Scott: You can't be, like, "I want to start at the

44
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:56,260
Scott: top.".

45
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,132
Rym: You can only start at a certain-- Oh, that's a Super Meat Boy-style incentive right there.

46
00:04:00,193 --> 00:04:01,760
Rym: Like, yeah, if you get to the top, guess what?

47
00:04:02,661 --> 00:04:03,606
Scott: Yeah, you get to ride down.

48
00:04:03,646 --> 00:04:12,140
Scott: So, you basically get to ride down virtually at 45 miles an hour, which is, uh, you know, I would never ride down, especially since the course is almost all hairpin turns.

49
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:18,839
Rym: I was about to say, I'm very comfortable going 45 to 50 miles an hour on my bike, not if I have to turn while going at that speed.

50
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,653
Scott: Yeah, it's, like, you're just, it's just virtual, and you can't go off course.

51
00:04:21,673 --> 00:04:27,900
Scott: I'm just going 45 miles an hour, like, it's straight, and I'm going around a hairpin turn at 45, not slowing down to turn or anything.

52
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:28,566
Scott: It's just, like,

53
00:04:28,587 --> 00:04:28,688
Scott: "Whoop!"

54
00:04:29,681 --> 00:04:46,800
Rym: Like, it's telling, I will, like, I've tried, like, skiing, I'll take turns at 45 or 50 miles an hour, but there's a big difference between, like, night, basically long knives digging into snow at a soft landing versus a bike and these tiny thin little tires on asphalt.

55
00:04:48,242 --> 00:04:50,099
Rym: Also, landing on asphalt if I fuck it up.

56
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:58,399
Scott: But, yeah, and also when you start climbing this mountain, the game, like, switches into, like, a different user interface that shows you, like, the segments and a map and everything.

57
00:04:58,439 --> 00:04:59,825
Scott: It's, like, a special area.

58
00:04:59,845 --> 00:05:02,455
Scott: And when you get to the top, they give you a prize.

59
00:05:02,475 --> 00:05:03,539
Scott: I got some gloves.

60
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,421
Scott: Everyone's, like,

61
00:05:04,441 --> 00:05:04,803
Scott: "Whatever."

62
00:05:06,308 --> 00:05:09,360
Scott: Virtual gloves for my guy that they're not gonna wear.

63
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:10,945
Rym: So, there is some big news.

64
00:05:10,985 --> 00:05:16,711
Rym: This isn't just gaming, but it overlaps with gaming heavily, and also it's a pretty big deal, so I think we'll talk about it today.

65
00:05:16,731 --> 00:05:17,555
Rym: to start.

66
00:05:18,338 --> 00:05:32,601
Rym: Discord, if you're not familiar, and I don't know how, but especially if you're listening to a podcast called GeekNights, but it's basically this, it's sort of social media, but it's more, like, a federated way.

67
00:05:32,641 --> 00:05:33,665
Scott: It's just IRC.

68
00:05:34,187 --> 00:05:38,123
Rym: Yeah, but it's a way to make a little community server, like, you can just spin one up free.

69
00:05:38,143 --> 00:05:39,229
Rym: It's on someone else's computer.

70
00:05:39,269 --> 00:05:39,873
Rym: They just host it.

71
00:05:40,476 --> 00:05:43,917
Scott: And basically, I mean, Slack and Discord are basically the same thing for different audiences.

72
00:05:43,937 --> 00:05:47,113
Scott: It's, like, "Hey, we're gonna make running an IRC server easier.

73
00:05:47,133 --> 00:05:48,560
Scott: You just push your button and you have one.

74
00:05:48,941 --> 00:06:01,847
Scott: We're gonna add a, we're gonna make it easier to connect to it with a special client and all sorts of easy features like streaming and voice chat and posting embedded tweets and graphics and all these things that IRC doesn't have.

75
00:06:02,769 --> 00:06:09,453
Scott: And we're gonna make it free and, you know, come on in, set it up, have a good time, right?

76
00:06:09,634 --> 00:06:10,740
Scott: Make all the servers you want.

77
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:11,881
Rym: Yep.

78
00:06:12,362 --> 00:06:17,822
Rym: And Discord really focused for a long time and still has a lot of features around gaming in particular.

79
00:06:17,842 --> 00:06:18,988
Rym: Like, it makes it really easy.

80
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:22,606
Rym: Like, if I'm playing a game, I can just live stream it to whatever voice channel I'm in.

81
00:06:22,988 --> 00:06:24,737
Rym: You can make, like, dedicated voice chat.

82
00:06:24,757 --> 00:06:25,802
Rym: Like, it's a pretty slick thing.

83
00:06:26,224 --> 00:06:29,938
Scott: The original intent of Discord was, like, you're a Twitch streamer, right?

84
00:06:30,058 --> 00:06:34,602
Scott: But you want to have a community outside of your Twitch stream because you might not be streaming all the time.

85
00:06:34,622 --> 00:06:37,374
Scott: And so you set up a Discord server and it integrates.

86
00:06:37,435 --> 00:06:42,516
Scott: So it's, like, all right, people who subscribe to you on Twitch get into separate special channels on your Discord.

87
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:48,760
Scott: You know, you can, you know, or, you know, the Twitch chat is unusable, but the Discord chat may be over there.

88
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,725
Scott: Those are people who really care about you specifically and not just, you know, passers by in the Twitch chat.

89
00:06:53,745 --> 00:06:57,747
Scott: So maybe you could actually get some, you could actually read that chat, maybe it's not just an emoji flood.

90
00:06:57,928 --> 00:07:00,298
Rym: You also have a lot more control over that community.

91
00:07:00,318 --> 00:07:00,700
Scott: Exactly.

92
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:14,840
Scott: So the idea, the original idea was you integrate it with your Twitch channel when you're a streamer and then you have, but now, you know, at first I was hesitant to use Discord because that was what it was for, but they really branched out and made it, you know, useful for way more use cases.

93
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:32,058
Scott: My favorite use case is if you subscribe to someone on Patreon and they link their Discord server to their Patreon account and you link your Discord account to your Patreon account and then you Patreon them, it automatically adds you to their Discord server community.

94
00:07:32,078 --> 00:07:34,168
Rym: I was thinking about setting that up, I just haven't.

95
00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:35,596
Scott: Yeah, just set it up.

96
00:07:35,636 --> 00:07:36,219
Scott: Yeah, I appreciate it.

97
00:07:36,239 --> 00:07:36,501
Scott: Why not?

98
00:07:37,363 --> 00:07:52,394
Rym: So Discord is heavily used and one of the most important things about it is that there's history, like you can read about the history of Discord, but it primarily charges the users as opposed to selling the users to other people, which is a big plus.

99
00:07:53,196 --> 00:07:53,737
Scott: Yeah, that's good.

100
00:07:54,159 --> 00:08:01,788
Scott: And the problem is, again, is that it's, you know, you don't have to pay them anything, it's free, but if you do pay, you get some stuff just for you.

101
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:07,124
Scott: But their other way of monetizing is these server boosts.

102
00:08:07,325 --> 00:08:18,191
Scott: So the idea is that, all right, listen, you know, you're a Twitch streamer, if you're big enough Twitch streamer, you've got fans who are big fans, they're willing to, like, subscribe to you to give you five dollars for nothing.

103
00:08:18,553 --> 00:08:23,917
Rym: Yeah, get a hundred of your fans to boost your Discord server and now they all get more features in that Discord server.

104
00:08:23,938 --> 00:08:35,928
Scott: So if you can get enough people to boost your server, because that's like their main community, right, those people don't need to boost their own accounts necessarily because, you know, how many other Discord servers are they going to?

105
00:08:35,967 --> 00:08:36,913
Scott: That's their main home.

106
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:43,922
Scott: And if the server is boosted enough, then everyone in the server, even the free users, get advantage of the boosted server.

107
00:08:43,942 --> 00:08:55,725
Scott: So that's a good model for that Twitch thing, but it's not a great model for the, you know, just group of friends hanging out server because you're not going to have enough people in there to boost the server.

108
00:08:55,745 --> 00:09:01,768
Scott: So every individual person would have to pay for their own Discord to boost themselves, which is a lot of money.

109
00:09:01,788 --> 00:09:10,824
Scott: So you'd get it there in that situation to get a mix of people who are paying to boost themselves because they use Discord on a lot of servers and people who are just free.

110
00:09:10,844 --> 00:09:15,140
Rym: God, I'm in like 17, 18 Discords and I actively use about six of them.

111
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:23,227
Scott: I was in a bunch and then I just removed a ton and I really cut it down to just the ones that are, you know, meaningful or Patreon and such.

112
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:30,251
Rym: But the news, like Discord is super important to the general Internet social ecosystem and also to the gaming ecosystem.

113
00:09:30,953 --> 00:09:38,037
Rym: And the news broke yesterday that it was looking like it was going to be sold for a lot of money.

114
00:09:38,098 --> 00:09:38,780
Rym: The going number.

115
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:44,302
Scott: I mean, we knew you knew as soon from years ago that Discord's only future was being sold to someone else.

116
00:09:44,544 --> 00:09:45,468
Scott: They don't have a stand up.

117
00:09:45,488 --> 00:09:47,197
Scott: They never had a standalone future.

118
00:09:47,217 --> 00:09:48,402
Scott: So that was not a surprise.

119
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:54,323
Rym: As far as I'm aware, they were actually profitable currently because they can be profitable.

120
00:09:54,363 --> 00:10:01,072
Rym: Like how many people actually pay for Discord boosting compared to how many people have a lot of free Discord and how much does it cost to run Discord?

121
00:10:01,212 --> 00:10:01,554
Scott: Yeah.

122
00:10:01,594 --> 00:10:04,827
Scott: Video streaming going on and audio streaming going on.

123
00:10:04,847 --> 00:10:09,103
Rym: We're recording gig nights in a Discord that's boosted and has higher audio quality.

124
00:10:10,007 --> 00:10:10,308
Scott: Right.

125
00:10:10,368 --> 00:10:11,753
Scott: But it's like they're losing money.

126
00:10:12,295 --> 00:10:13,439
Scott: They had to be losing money on this.

127
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:13,741
Scott: But yeah.

128
00:10:14,082 --> 00:10:19,428
Scott: So when it was said, oh, someone's going to buy it, I was like, oh, I knew someone was eventually going to buy it, but I guess it's soon.

129
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:23,504
Scott: And my top pick was, you know, for who it is, is probably Microsoft.

130
00:10:23,524 --> 00:10:24,487
Scott: That makes the most sense.

131
00:10:25,551 --> 00:10:28,702
Rym: I wondered if it would be like Tencent or a game company.

132
00:10:28,722 --> 00:10:30,227
Scott: It's possible.

133
00:10:30,408 --> 00:10:33,358
Scott: Someone suggested Epic might do it, which makes a little sense.

134
00:10:33,439 --> 00:10:36,489
Scott: Valve, but Valve's not a big buyer of companies.

135
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:39,884
Rym: Also, Valve has invested so much in their own social ecosystem.

136
00:10:39,985 --> 00:10:41,953
Rym: I'm not saying it's good or it works.

137
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:44,665
Scott: Amazon makes a lot of sense because of the Twitch integration.

138
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:53,179
Scott: But Amazon and also Facebook, which makes almost as much sense as Amazon, are both in antitrust hot waters, hotter than at least the other big companies.

139
00:10:53,239 --> 00:10:53,440
Scott: Right.

140
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,812
Scott: Microsoft got out of their hot water.

141
00:10:55,852 --> 00:11:06,074
Rym: It wouldn't have been a good look for them if in the middle of all that, they bought one of the one of the most used like communications platforms during a global pandemic when people are relying on these things.

142
00:11:06,636 --> 00:11:06,837
Scott: Yeah.

143
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,021
Rym: Like it makes sense.

144
00:11:09,004 --> 00:11:10,349
Scott: Microsoft makes the most sense.

145
00:11:10,429 --> 00:11:16,389
Scott: And it turns out the rumors were like, yeah, it's probably Microsoft that's buying it.

146
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:25,317
Rym: No one will comment from either company, but numerous outlets are reporting that it is very likely Microsoft and it is very likely ten billion dollars.

147
00:11:25,678 --> 00:11:28,248
Rym: And it is in the acquisition conversation stage.

148
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:31,422
Rym: But it's not like confirmed or signed that they're going to do the deal there.

149
00:11:31,744 --> 00:11:32,828
Rym: It's possible it could fall through.

150
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:34,194
Scott: Seems likely.

151
00:11:34,656 --> 00:11:36,283
Scott: You know, it's probably the best, the best fit.

152
00:11:36,685 --> 00:11:36,886
Rym: Yeah.

153
00:11:37,448 --> 00:11:39,536
Scott: It's interesting because there's no one else who can.

154
00:11:39,556 --> 00:11:43,113
Scott: I mean, the list of people who can afford ten billion dollars is really small.

155
00:11:43,174 --> 00:11:47,173
Scott: So it's not like there's a lot of, you know, you don't have to like guess far down the list.

156
00:11:47,193 --> 00:11:50,248
Scott: It's like, well, no one else lower on the list has ten billion dollars.

157
00:11:50,489 --> 00:11:51,433
Scott: There's a lot of companies.

158
00:11:51,493 --> 00:11:55,494
Scott: And even Apple, who definitely has well over ten billion dollars, they don't want that.

159
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:56,258
Scott: What are they going to do with it?

160
00:11:56,319 --> 00:11:57,526
Scott: That is not something they're going to do.

161
00:11:57,787 --> 00:11:57,988
Rym: Yep.

162
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:03,516
Rym: And especially like thinking about there's a lot of companies that could probably do some really fun stuff and make cool things.

163
00:12:03,536 --> 00:12:06,929
Rym: You're having discord, but none of those companies could afford this company.

164
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:08,134
Rym: So it was moot.

165
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:08,817
Rym: Like, exactly.

166
00:12:09,219 --> 00:12:09,961
Rym: So here we are.

167
00:12:09,981 --> 00:12:14,256
Rym: I am glad it's Microsoft because I suspect they won't ruin it.

168
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,986
Rym: Or if they do, they will ruin it as fast as other companies.

169
00:12:17,909 --> 00:12:26,926
Rym: We were legit talking about how yesterday, if it had been Facebook, I think we would have planned to shut down and migrate everything we do on discord somewhere else, like quickly.

170
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:31,222
Rym: Because Facebook does not have a good track record of not completely ruining things they buy.

171
00:12:31,422 --> 00:12:32,044
Rym: Have Beluga.

172
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:37,394
Scott: Who even remembers that?

173
00:12:38,957 --> 00:12:42,667
Rym: Beluga was revolutionary for its time and was super useful.

174
00:12:42,687 --> 00:12:44,172
Scott: Yeah, that's true.

175
00:12:44,533 --> 00:12:45,014
Rym: I guess.

176
00:12:45,456 --> 00:12:46,118
Rym: Well, you know what?

177
00:12:46,258 --> 00:12:47,382
Rym: Discord kind of replaced it.

178
00:12:47,824 --> 00:12:52,020
Rym: We actually we've replaced Beluga with like eight different things over the years.

179
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,291
Rym: And discord is just the current thing we've replaced it with.

180
00:12:54,572 --> 00:12:54,733
Scott: Yep.

181
00:12:54,753 --> 00:12:55,718
Scott: All right.

182
00:12:55,758 --> 00:12:57,104
Scott: So let's get through some other tiny news.

183
00:12:57,124 --> 00:12:58,529
Scott: It's also Microsoft, right?

184
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:04,471
Scott: So if you have an Xbox, there was always this thing called Xbox Live, Xbox Live Gold, right?

185
00:13:04,511 --> 00:13:10,356
Scott: And if you wanted to play your Xbox games online, you had to subscribe to it just like PlayStation Network, just like Nintendo online.

186
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,384
Scott: And it was like a monthly fee.

187
00:13:13,187 --> 00:13:17,222
Scott: And I paid for it for a very, very short period of time back in the day when I had Xbox.

188
00:13:18,766 --> 00:13:20,672
Scott: You know, and then I stopped, right?

189
00:13:20,973 --> 00:13:25,169
Scott: Well, it turns out that there was a whole bunch of different things going on here.

190
00:13:25,229 --> 00:13:30,073
Scott: But like at one point, they were suggesting they were going to raise the price, and they were going to do other stuff.

191
00:13:30,174 --> 00:13:32,183
Scott: And then it's like, okay, we're not going to do that.

192
00:13:32,203 --> 00:13:38,330
Rym: But looking like we talked about this run a recent GeekNights episode, like all the stuff that was going on with Xbox online services.

193
00:13:38,471 --> 00:13:38,712
Rym: Yeah.

194
00:13:39,314 --> 00:13:44,153
Scott: But what they're doing now is they're going to just get rid of the name Xbox Live because it'd be confusing.

195
00:13:44,354 --> 00:13:45,076
Scott: because right.

196
00:13:45,137 --> 00:13:47,747
Scott: And they're going to have a new thing called Xbox Network.

197
00:13:48,189 --> 00:13:55,698
Scott: But it sounds like what they're going to the X that that service that is going to be called Xbox Network is going to provide some other stuff.

198
00:13:55,738 --> 00:13:56,903
Scott: Who knows what it's going to provide.

199
00:13:57,685 --> 00:14:04,568
Scott: But if you just want to play Xbox games online, they're just going to stop charging extra money for that nonsense.

200
00:14:04,909 --> 00:14:10,069
Scott: I think it's what it sounds like, which is great because that's what you should have done from the fucking beginning.

201
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,039
Scott: It's like on your computer.

202
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,790
Scott: I don't have to pay extra to play my Counter Strike online.

203
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:16,757
Scott: It's like things feel extra.

204
00:14:16,777 --> 00:14:19,950
Rym: And then it's like I can't play Nintendo games on my computer.

205
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,798
Rym: So I'd less like annoyed by it.

206
00:14:21,818 --> 00:14:23,044
Rym: I'm still annoyed by Nintendo online.

207
00:14:23,104 --> 00:14:29,680
Scott: It's like imagine if you play Counter Strike and Rocket League, if you've got a computer, you buy Counter Strike, you buy Rocket League and you can play them forever online.

208
00:14:30,062 --> 00:14:36,091
Scott: If you're on Xbox and you buy Counter Strike and Rocket League, I don't even know if Counter Strike is an Xbox anymore, but Rocket League definitely is.

209
00:14:37,175 --> 00:14:38,962
Scott: And you want to or Star Wars Squadrons definitely is.

210
00:14:39,364 --> 00:14:41,312
Scott: And you want to play PlayStation only.

211
00:14:41,393 --> 00:14:41,734
Scott: I don't know.

212
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:43,140
Scott: But you want to play it online.

213
00:14:43,622 --> 00:14:46,739
Scott: In addition to buying the game and the console, you got to pay this monthly subscription.

214
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:47,562
Scott: That's fucking bullshit.

215
00:14:48,064 --> 00:14:54,910
Scott: Microsoft getting rid of the bullshit hopefully pressures the Playstations and Nintendo's to also get rid of the bull.

216
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:55,815
Rym: So this is fascinating.

217
00:14:55,835 --> 00:14:55,975
Rym: Yeah.

218
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:56,357
Rym: The article.

219
00:14:56,377 --> 00:15:05,951
Rym: when we talked about this last in January, it was because Microsoft announced that they were increasing the price of Xbox Live Gold to make it cost.

220
00:15:06,433 --> 00:15:13,610
Rym: Basically, it was a play around getting people to pay for the other service they were promoting the box.

221
00:15:14,132 --> 00:15:14,854
Rym: What do they call it?

222
00:15:16,618 --> 00:15:20,509
Scott: Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which is Xbox Gamer Pass.

223
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:23,377
Scott: The gamer pass is a different thing entirely.

224
00:15:23,397 --> 00:15:42,443
Scott: And it's actually not too bad if you think it's the way the Xbox gamer pass thing is, is it's basically you subscribe to it and then you get access to this huge library of games, almost like a Netflix of games, you know, especially compared to I don't know if it actually streams them to you or if you get to install them.

225
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:49,450
Scott: But compared to like the stadiums of the world, it seems to actually be like, you know, good, like a good deal.

226
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:55,113
Scott: If you got if you're going to play a lot of those games in library and you don't own them already, then it can work out.

227
00:15:55,554 --> 00:16:00,353
Scott: But that's completely separate from paying money to be able to play multiplayer in a multiplayer game.

228
00:16:01,056 --> 00:16:10,085
Rym: Well, what's extra fascinating is so I just took a course on like pricing and economics, like the economics of pricing things, which is like it was a modern course.

229
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:22,572
Rym: So it talked about like the current real world and a piece of something that I sort of realized in retrospect that I knew because I did this over the years, but I never said it out loud, was that a common thing.

230
00:16:22,612 --> 00:16:39,131
Rym: that is a good idea is if you have a service or a product and you want to kill it, but people are still paying for it, but you honestly don't want to sell it anymore, just increase the price because then people who are price sensitive will just walk away, thus making it easier for you to kill it.

231
00:16:39,573 --> 00:16:45,261
Rym: And anyone who's desperate to keep using it keeps paying you money and you just keep raising the price and raising the price and then cut it off.

232
00:16:47,749 --> 00:16:52,242
Rym: That is the most efficient way to capture money from something that you want to end anyway.

233
00:16:52,262 --> 00:17:09,028
Rym: I bet Microsoft did that Xbox Live Gold price thing as part of some strategy to lead to this moment, but I also suspect they had other goals and because of how poorly that first bit went, I think they changed targets and changed how they look at the market.

234
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:18,355
Scott: But I don't know, I don't know how many people know, I tried the Xbox gamer pass thing, there was a free trial.

235
00:17:18,376 --> 00:17:25,406
Scott: I was trying to play with a free trial and it just didn't fucking work on my computer, there was some bullshit and I installed that garbage.

236
00:17:25,808 --> 00:17:29,220
Scott: So, but I do have a friend and it's working for them, so all right.

237
00:17:29,963 --> 00:17:32,432
Scott: All right, now just some tiny extra news, right?

238
00:17:32,473 --> 00:17:37,492
Scott: So this is an indie game that I've seen a lot and I've played the first two of called Emily is Away.

239
00:17:37,954 --> 00:17:59,841
Scott: It's basically this little visual novel where you, a little aim, a simulation of an AOL Instant Messenger chat window is there and you choose dialogue options and you're basically talking to your friends once a year through high school, college times and you're sort of, you know, seeing how your relationship with these different people you're chatting with goes and one of the people is Emily and like they're away, right?

240
00:17:59,921 --> 00:18:03,982
Scott: And then they come, you know, they're not away, you talk to Emily and then Emily's away again, you get it.

241
00:18:05,086 --> 00:18:16,861
Scott: But Emily is Away 3 has been announced, it's coming out next month, I think, like April and it has a Facebook user interface, so it's like it's updating to a newer, younger person.

242
00:18:18,245 --> 00:18:19,669
Scott: Another tiny news, right?

243
00:18:20,331 --> 00:18:31,104
Scott: The best Ninja Turtles video games are always the side scrolling beat 'em up ones and, you know, like the arcade one, for example, or the turtles in time one, the Super Nintendo.

244
00:18:31,947 --> 00:18:38,534
Scott: They're coming out, they announced this Shredder's Revenge made by the same people who made the Scott Pilgrim side scrolling beat 'em up.

245
00:18:38,896 --> 00:18:44,981
Scott: We're making a Ninja Turtles side scrolling beat 'em up, which is, it's good news because you can't miss with this, right?

246
00:18:45,302 --> 00:18:55,040
Rym: That Scott Pilgrim game has a history, we've like talked about it a bunch of times because it disappeared and was on, you could not play it for a lot of reasons that were stupid.

247
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,087
Rym: And it was not the best side.

248
00:18:58,107 --> 00:19:02,784
Rym: scrolling beat 'em up, but it was real good and it had a really good sense of style.

249
00:19:02,804 --> 00:19:06,295
Rym: and that is the kind of thing you need from a turtle game.

250
00:19:06,335 --> 00:19:16,040
Rym: The style matters probably more than the game mechanics, but the game mechanics have to be good, they can't be bad, it can't be like Castle Crashers where it starts strong and just peters out into nothing.

251
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,886
Rym: Like you gotta keep me interested.

252
00:19:18,529 --> 00:19:23,631
Scott: Someone pointed out in the preview that all four turtles have running animations and how good of a sign that is.

253
00:19:23,711 --> 00:19:27,665
Rym: Yep, that is the exact kind of thing I would look at and say, "Ooh, they thought about

254
00:19:27,705 --> 00:19:27,906
Rym: that.".

255
00:19:28,527 --> 00:19:28,728
Scott: Yep.

256
00:19:28,969 --> 00:19:35,850
Scott: And one last tiny news, there is an action RPG that just went into open beta today.

257
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:40,164
Scott: It's based on the Magic the Gathering universe, it's called Magic Legends.

258
00:19:40,826 --> 00:19:45,240
Scott: I guess it's Diablo-ish, but also involves deck building somehow.

259
00:19:45,762 --> 00:19:48,190
Scott: And it's free and in open beta right now.

260
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:54,811
Scott: I don't know if it's good, I don't know if it's just Diablo click on stuff, but it's open beta.

261
00:19:54,831 --> 00:19:55,994
Scott: Should we poke at it?

262
00:19:56,556 --> 00:19:58,622
Scott: I installed it, I'm gonna try it probably tonight.

263
00:19:58,703 --> 00:20:04,240
Scott: I might uninstall it after five minutes, but it exists now, it went up today.

264
00:20:04,982 --> 00:20:12,000
Rym: All right, I won't have time to play it tonight 'cause I'm playing Blades in the Dark, but if you don't uninstall it after playing it, I will also install it this week and poke at it.

265
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:30,228
Scott: I feel like though Diablo 4 is coming, so it's like if you're in that mood to mindlessly click your way to hell and destroy Satan, then I feel like any other action RPG is just sort of like holding you off until then.

266
00:20:30,609 --> 00:20:32,596
Rym: Let's say cards represent spells.

267
00:20:33,137 --> 00:20:43,228
Scott: I feel like if you played another action RPG before Diablo 4, you might get out of the mood and then when Diablo 4 comes, Diablo 4 comes, you'd be like eh.

268
00:20:43,248 --> 00:20:46,520
Scott: I feel like it's better to only play Diablo and not any other.

269
00:20:47,882 --> 00:20:51,315
Rym: I don't know, we'll see 'cause it talks on this page.

270
00:20:51,355 --> 00:20:53,966
Rym: I'm looking at at the bottom about what the cards do, like making a deck.

271
00:20:54,348 --> 00:21:00,350
Rym: You basically make a deck of 12 cards, you have access to a hand of four at a time, and you randomly draw.

272
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:08,975
Rym: So it sounds like it's Diablo, but four of your actions are a cyclical random set of four from your deck of 12.

273
00:21:08,975 --> 00:21:13,327
Scott: So it's like a MOBA where you have your 4 abilities on Q, W, E, R. But they keep changing.

274
00:21:13,347 --> 00:21:23,240
Scott: You use ability Q, you use it, and rather than cooling down and doing Q again, it goes away into your deck and another ability comes in the Q spot.

275
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:33,484
Rym: I would want to hear from one of the game designers why they chose the number 12 specifically for the size of the deck.

276
00:21:33,505 --> 00:21:35,233
Scott: I think it's 'cause you have four abilities?

277
00:21:35,313 --> 00:21:38,450
Scott: is pretty standard for MOBA's and things like that nowadays, right?

278
00:21:38,591 --> 00:21:40,080
Scott: You know, you got four fingers on your hand.

279
00:21:41,601 --> 00:21:43,186
Scott: That's how games are these days.

280
00:21:43,266 --> 00:21:47,941
Scott: And then three different things on each possibilities for each finger.

281
00:21:48,062 --> 00:21:54,204
Scott: 'Cause two, I think it'd be like, okay, each slot is rotating between two things effectively, right?

282
00:21:54,525 --> 00:22:01,128
Scott: But if you got three, now it's mixed up to the point where it's not overwhelming with too many different abilities.

283
00:22:01,229 --> 00:22:02,717
Scott: Like you see up that one again, right?

284
00:22:02,757 --> 00:22:04,205
Scott: If it's too many, you're like, what the hell is this?

285
00:22:04,225 --> 00:22:06,220
Scott: You got to read every time you press a button, right?

286
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,380
Rym: But if it's too few, that mechanic just becomes meaningless and it's just the album.

287
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,003
Scott: Yeah.

288
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:18,156
Scott: If it's just two things, then it'd be like, you'd just be like, oh, well, I just want to get this other ability Q and then keep using, use all your abilities.

289
00:22:18,256 --> 00:22:23,480
Scott: And then you're guaranteed that if you just use all four, you're guaranteed that the one you want will be in the next set.

290
00:22:25,642 --> 00:22:26,787
Scott: So the, yeah, that makes sense.

291
00:22:27,028 --> 00:22:34,504
Scott: But I'm gonna, you know, at least it's an interesting new idea and people will play it because of the intellectual property and it's currently free open beta.

292
00:22:34,805 --> 00:22:37,335
Scott: So you, it's the cost of your time to install it.

293
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:39,123
Rym: And I'll see if you actually install it.

294
00:22:39,183 --> 00:22:40,852
Rym: And if you don't uninstall it, I installed it.

295
00:22:41,053 --> 00:22:42,200
Scott: I just don't know if I'll uninstall.

296
00:22:44,562 --> 00:22:48,340
Rym: I mean, this could be the last, we got really into autochess for a hot minute back there.

297
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,228
Rym: And now that I have not ever launched that again.

298
00:22:51,153 --> 00:22:52,459
Scott: No autochess went away.

299
00:22:52,479 --> 00:22:58,869
Rym: You know, it had a good time and then a good time, but it was funny how much like, I remember we speculated, is this just a flash in the pan?

300
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:02,684
Rym: It flashed so hard and then disappeared so hard.

301
00:23:03,387 --> 00:23:12,899
Scott: I think, I think the real problem was that the, you know, there was the original and then there was the standalone one made by the people who made the original dodo mod.

302
00:23:13,019 --> 00:23:13,220
Scott: Right.

303
00:23:13,741 --> 00:23:16,110
Scott: And then there was underlords made by valve.

304
00:23:16,672 --> 00:23:19,465
Scott: And then there was the other one made by the league of legends people.

305
00:23:19,585 --> 00:23:24,832
Rym: And it, what happened was I don't remember which one was like, I remember the names of something, but I don't remember teamfight tactics.

306
00:23:24,913 --> 00:23:27,163
Scott: Teamfight tactics was the legal legends one.

307
00:23:27,183 --> 00:23:27,404
Scott: Yeah.

308
00:23:27,504 --> 00:23:33,405
Scott: Uh, the, the, the, the, the one made by the people who made the original dodo mod was just autochess.

309
00:23:33,867 --> 00:23:38,422
Scott: And then the underworlds is the valve one, dodo under worlds, underlords.

310
00:23:38,703 --> 00:23:38,903
Scott: Right.

311
00:23:39,225 --> 00:23:48,117
Scott: But I think what happened is that the league of legends one, one that was like the one that won the battle of the auto chess is the, the teamfight tactics one.

312
00:23:48,518 --> 00:23:51,149
Scott: And that was the one that I was least interested in and didn't care for.

313
00:23:51,169 --> 00:23:52,796
Scott: And that's why I fell out.

314
00:23:52,856 --> 00:23:57,555
Scott: If the underlords one would have won, I probably would have stayed in the hot pan a little longer.

315
00:23:57,575 --> 00:23:57,635
Scott: Yup.

316
00:23:57,916 --> 00:23:59,623
Scott: I wouldn't be in it now.

317
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:00,770
Scott: I couldn't see that happening.

318
00:24:01,212 --> 00:24:02,680
Scott: Um, but I would have stayed a little longer.

319
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,736
Rym: Cause it definitely got a little repetitive and like it would take too long.

320
00:24:06,777 --> 00:24:12,118
Rym: Like I'd see that I've lost and it was, I couldn't just like, well, like I lose, let's just play again.

321
00:24:12,178 --> 00:24:14,187
Rym: Like the game had a lot waiting time.

322
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:21,273
Scott: I'll probably talk about this in the future, but I have, there's a, there's a, uh, a Japanese mahjong app I've been playing just for a couple of days.

323
00:24:21,735 --> 00:24:27,752
Scott: And now that it's come up here, mahjong and auto chess are really fucking similar games.

324
00:24:29,095 --> 00:24:30,178
Rym: I can see that.

325
00:24:30,499 --> 00:24:32,187
Scott: They're really similar games.

326
00:24:32,207 --> 00:24:36,406
Rym: Cause all the fighting and animation stuff you look at when you're playing an auto chess, that's just color.

327
00:24:36,427 --> 00:24:37,632
Rym: That doesn't actually mean anything.

328
00:24:37,652 --> 00:24:38,234
Rym: Yeah.

329
00:24:38,355 --> 00:24:39,379
Scott: It's really similar.

330
00:24:40,841 --> 00:24:42,203
Scott: Um, but yeah, well I'll talk about the mahjong.

331
00:24:42,223 --> 00:24:43,444
Scott: maybe, you know, two weeks from now.

332
00:24:43,464 --> 00:24:59,202
Rym: A lot of video games do the same thing.

333
00:24:59,222 --> 00:25:17,427
Rym: You ever notice how, when you watch like a modern, like mid budget movie or TV show, if there's action in like Mexico or central or South America, everything's always color graded, really yellow and orange.

334
00:25:17,869 --> 00:25:21,868
Rym: And if it's set in like Europe, everything's always color graded, like really blue and stock.

335
00:25:22,089 --> 00:25:24,420
Rym: Like the color grading is almost so predictable.

336
00:25:25,422 --> 00:25:25,623
Scott: Yeah.

337
00:25:26,105 --> 00:25:31,267
Rym: So this is a really good video that dives into the fact that there are times and places to do that.

338
00:25:31,849 --> 00:25:41,086
Rym: And when that arose, like when early color grading started to be used, it was used to great effect to like tell good stories, create immersion, create difference between scenes.

339
00:25:41,769 --> 00:25:51,465
Rym: But the argument this makes is that Hollywood, and I would argue video games too, have gotten whether they intended it or not really racist about how they use it.

340
00:25:52,087 --> 00:26:01,580
Rym: And it makes a point about how, and we talk about this a lot in games and in all the GeekNights episodes about like all the topics, the technology made it easier to do this.

341
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:09,192
Rym: Like I can take film that was like footage I shot that wasn't even like shot to be color graded and color graded pretty well without a lot of work.

342
00:26:09,252 --> 00:26:10,679
Rym: Like technology got really good at that.

343
00:26:13,043 --> 00:26:20,973
Rym: So if I also have watched a bunch of movies, but didn't quite understand them, I might've internalized, yeah, Mexico looks like that.

344
00:26:21,033 --> 00:26:21,857
Rym: France looks like that.

345
00:26:21,917 --> 00:26:22,821
Rym: Norway looks like that.

346
00:26:23,062 --> 00:26:28,362
Rym: And I want to make it a video game and it's, I'm a producer and it's set in, I don't know, Mexico.

347
00:26:28,382 --> 00:26:36,117
Rym: I might just expect that we should color grade it to look like the way it looked in the movies and the movies made it look that way because they were aping other movies.

348
00:26:36,439 --> 00:26:43,746
Rym: And the first movie that did it actually did it to make, to make a point and all of that nuance and context and intention was lost.

349
00:26:43,826 --> 00:26:52,390
Rym: And now you have the technology and using this technology to get this effect without thinking about why you're doing it.

350
00:26:52,791 --> 00:26:59,173
Rym: And it's led to this being like almost a like embedded racist trope of modern television and gaming and movies.

351
00:26:59,996 --> 00:27:02,365
Scott: I mean, that's how, you know, art history is right.

352
00:27:02,466 --> 00:27:08,514
Scott: One person makes like a really realistic looking statue and suddenly have a whole trend of people making realistic looking statues.

353
00:27:08,574 --> 00:27:08,775
Scott: Right.

354
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:14,344
Scott: And then, you know, you get someone who makes a noir movie and suddenly you get a whole movement of people making noir movies.

355
00:27:14,364 --> 00:27:14,525
Scott: Right.

356
00:27:14,565 --> 00:27:19,563
Scott: So color grading, it's like, yeah, it's a particular style emerges, right.

357
00:27:19,884 --> 00:27:29,020
Scott: And then, you know, people ape that style for however long until it goes out of style, you know, fashion, all the different art forms, the same kind of stuff happens.

358
00:27:29,641 --> 00:27:35,798
Scott: It just so happens that, you know, in a case like this, it can be a racist trope.

359
00:27:35,818 --> 00:27:36,942
Scott: that is, you know,

360
00:27:36,962 --> 00:27:52,540
Rym: because people a lot of people using this technology, especially in the kind of like the movies that an American would watch, tend to be using it to express distance and otherness of places that aren't the place where the movies set or where the American characters came from.

361
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,899
Scott: Well, I mean, it's they're applying the same technique even in non racist situations.

362
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,080
Scott: Right.

363
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:08,298
Scott: So if you think about if you're playing a video game that's like in a horror scene, like like an old, you know, the old typical like like Ravenholm kind of town in Half Life,

364
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,773
Rym: you get like a curve a certain way, every like shadows or everything

365
00:28:12,813 --> 00:28:13,355
Scott: is

366
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:13,456
Rym: into

367
00:28:14,038 --> 00:28:15,363
Scott: everything's all gray.

368
00:28:15,625 --> 00:28:15,906
Scott: Right.

369
00:28:15,966 --> 00:28:19,322
Scott: It's like, well, it's not racist to make a place all gray because it's a spooky castle.

370
00:28:19,362 --> 00:28:20,285
Scott: That's just the spot.

371
00:28:20,546 --> 00:28:27,773
Scott: What if every movie if that's your but if that's your artistic style and you go to a desert, it's like, yeah, it is a desert there.

372
00:28:28,215 --> 00:28:32,653
Scott: And then it's like, well, I made the castle place all gray at night with the bats and the vampires.

373
00:28:32,934 --> 00:28:34,178
Scott: I'll make the desert all yellow.

374
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,141
Scott: Right.

375
00:28:35,241 --> 00:28:36,749
Scott: It's like it's a desert country.

376
00:28:36,809 --> 00:28:39,723
Scott: It's like, yeah, but the whole country isn't just like that.

377
00:28:39,944 --> 00:28:40,165
Rym: Yep.

378
00:28:40,426 --> 00:28:43,638
Scott: Well, especially when look at look at Counter-Strike, D.E.

379
00:28:43,658 --> 00:28:46,671
Rym: Dust, come on, especially when it's real world places like even gray.

380
00:28:46,731 --> 00:28:52,619
Rym: Like what if I think I've seen a trope where a lot of Eastern European countries get color graded, really gray and washed out.

381
00:28:53,501 --> 00:29:03,484
Scott: Well, I think that, you know, I think there the grayness might be a problem, but I think the greater problem is that every story you're telling in Eastern European places is some sort of vampire horror story.

382
00:29:03,524 --> 00:29:07,640
Scott: So this video tell tell a different story about Eastern European people.

383
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:12,322
Rym: That's not, you know, that kind of video gets into it a lot at a point because a lot of people don't travel.

384
00:29:12,703 --> 00:29:22,485
Rym: Part of the weird thing that happens is there are people who then like eventually visit a place like Mexico and it doesn't look the way like it's always been portrayed this one stereotypical way.

385
00:29:22,746 --> 00:29:24,896
Rym: They've never seen what it literally actually looks like.

386
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:27,526
Rym: Look at a normal photograph of a random place in Mexico.

387
00:29:27,546 --> 00:29:28,890
Rym: Mm hmm.

388
00:29:29,552 --> 00:29:42,016
Scott: If you are someone who has not gotten to travel much and you don't really know a lot about the rest of the world looks like other than, you know, like the, you know, photos that you would see in like, you know, of famous places.

389
00:29:42,136 --> 00:29:42,417
Scott: Right.

390
00:29:42,859 --> 00:29:49,685
Scott: Like if you've seen a photo of the Vatican, but you know, Rome really looks like to be in Rome, you know, maybe you saw Roman holiday or something.

391
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:55,986
Scott: It's like go and use Google Street View and go to Rome for free right now.

392
00:29:56,066 --> 00:29:57,633
Scott: You can't get covered this way, I promise.

393
00:29:57,714 --> 00:30:05,284
Rym: And you'll see a lot of just like real stuff like how people actually live, like walking around, like what a friend Google like Google Street View.

394
00:30:05,344 --> 00:30:07,032
Scott: Tourism is not a waste of time.

395
00:30:07,132 --> 00:30:08,819
Scott: I do it occasionally when I'm bored.

396
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:11,014
Scott: I'll just go somewhere and be like, oh, what does this place look like?

397
00:30:11,034 --> 00:30:14,289
Rym: I want to say I saw Drew Toothpaste has been like into that a lot lately on Twitter.

398
00:30:15,353 --> 00:30:15,895
Scott: Yeah, it's not.

399
00:30:16,197 --> 00:30:19,811
Scott: I wouldn't be like so just being big into this hobby all the time.

400
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:25,194
Scott: But it's like, you know, once in a while, I'll just like like I went to a couple of weeks ago, I just I was like.

401
00:30:25,214 --> 00:30:28,931
Scott: I was like, you know, what is a fishing village actually look like?

402
00:30:28,951 --> 00:30:32,412
Scott: Because whenever you see a fishing village, it's always like you just see the area where they're fishing.

403
00:30:33,136 --> 00:30:34,806
Scott: I was like, I want to walk around the fishing village.

404
00:30:34,987 --> 00:30:36,053
Scott: So I walked around the fishing village.

405
00:30:36,094 --> 00:30:36,516
Scott: I found one.

406
00:30:36,717 --> 00:30:46,451
Rym: So one thing that's actually really cool is because I have fancy VR with the index Street View in Google Earth with VR is shockingly high quality.

407
00:30:46,532 --> 00:30:48,297
Rym: Like you would not believe.

408
00:30:48,517 --> 00:30:51,852
Scott: Can you can you do a multiplayer, though, like hang out in a fishing village with other people?

409
00:30:52,415 --> 00:30:54,063
Rym: Not in Google Earth itself.

410
00:30:54,806 --> 00:30:55,629
Scott: No, that's a shame.

411
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:58,060
Rym: But there's other VR after someone could like make that environment.

412
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,104
Rym: You could hang out in it.

413
00:30:59,185 --> 00:30:59,667
Rym: But sure.

414
00:30:59,828 --> 00:31:01,375
Rym: But that isn't just like built into Google Earth.

415
00:31:01,918 --> 00:31:04,489
Scott: It would be cool to like meet someone in VR walking down the street.

416
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:08,065
Rym: Yeah, I feel like someone could make that and make money with it.

417
00:31:08,126 --> 00:31:11,320
Rym: I feel like that could be a one yet another like tool in the VR toolkit.

418
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:17,179
Rym: Maybe, but I've like I've gone to actually an early covid since we didn't go to Japan.

419
00:31:17,219 --> 00:31:20,371
Rym: I used VR quite a bit to go to the places I'd planned to go to and look around.

420
00:31:20,391 --> 00:31:22,860
Rym: And it was it was interesting.

421
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,946
Rym: It scratched that itch a little bit, but not enough.

422
00:31:26,772 --> 00:31:27,555
Rym: But it's better than nothing.

423
00:31:27,575 --> 00:31:28,900
Rym: So what do you got?

424
00:31:30,661 --> 00:31:31,244
Scott: What do I have?

425
00:31:31,305 --> 00:31:41,703
Scott: So, you know, something we like to talk about here on GeekNights a lot, you know, from time to time is the game theory, right, which is an actual field of, you know, economics, right, academically speaking.

426
00:31:42,666 --> 00:31:45,254
Scott: And it applies into a lot of things in the world.

427
00:31:45,315 --> 00:31:50,680
Scott: But it also does apply to competitive gaming, which is the reason that we had an interest in it whatsoever.

428
00:31:52,061 --> 00:31:56,881
Scott: And in college, we took a few books out of the library and read them and mostly half understood them.

429
00:31:56,961 --> 00:31:57,182
Rym: Yeah.

430
00:31:57,283 --> 00:31:59,511
Scott: And we'd like to do a few other things now and then.

431
00:31:59,892 --> 00:32:03,646
Scott: But we have no formal, you know, game theory, knowledge or training.

432
00:32:03,907 --> 00:32:06,336
Scott: People are actually game theory people.

433
00:32:06,376 --> 00:32:07,722
Scott: They know way more than we do.

434
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:08,585
Rym: Oh, absolutely.

435
00:32:08,646 --> 00:32:11,920
Rym: Like I know, like combinatorial analysis, which is still baby stuff.

436
00:32:12,281 --> 00:32:15,776
Rym: I know the applications and what is useful for and how to do it.

437
00:32:15,796 --> 00:32:16,339
Rym: You can't do it.

438
00:32:16,419 --> 00:32:23,531
Rym: But to actually do it myself would require me sitting with a lot of references and spending a lot of time because I do not have any of that stuff internalizing.

439
00:32:24,255 --> 00:32:28,777
Scott: And we know that, you know, maybe you don't want to go back to college again and get a degree in it.

440
00:32:28,917 --> 00:32:30,164
Scott: It's, you know, economics degree.

441
00:32:30,184 --> 00:32:30,928
Scott: You probably don't want that.

442
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:34,625
Rym: I mean, if I didn't have to work and that was free and I had I could live, I would.

443
00:32:34,645 --> 00:32:48,782
Scott: But what you can do is, you know, you can go to Yale, the university, Yale, the Ivy League school, and they have put online a game theory course for free.

444
00:32:49,364 --> 00:32:56,746
Scott: So if you can understand the material in the course, you have the prerequisite knowledge available to you in your brain.

445
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:57,870
Scott: Here you go.

446
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:58,773
Scott: Free class.

447
00:32:58,793 --> 00:32:59,094
Scott: You can.

448
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:05,471
Scott: if you took this class online, you would know more than game theory than I do by a lot.

449
00:33:05,612 --> 00:33:05,913
Scott: Yeah.

450
00:33:05,993 --> 00:33:09,586
Scott: So and I talk, I see a lot of talking points.

451
00:33:09,807 --> 00:33:11,233
Rym: Like there's a whole one of the lectures.

452
00:33:11,314 --> 00:33:12,640
Rym: There's twenty four lectures.

453
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,106
Rym: You can just watch like they're just here.

454
00:33:14,126 --> 00:33:16,736
Rym: One of them is on credible threats.

455
00:33:17,138 --> 00:33:18,142
Rym: We've talked about that a lot.

456
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:19,526
Rym: Mm hmm.

457
00:33:20,007 --> 00:33:22,474
Rym: First mover advantages, aggression cycles.

458
00:33:22,755 --> 00:33:25,023
Rym: This looks like I think I want to go through this.

459
00:33:25,927 --> 00:33:26,770
Scott: Yeah.

460
00:33:26,891 --> 00:33:30,185
Scott: So I mean, you might have to watch some of these more than once if they're too high level.

461
00:33:30,225 --> 00:33:30,386
Scott: Right.

462
00:33:30,406 --> 00:33:32,638
Scott: You know, to get a better to get a full understanding.

463
00:33:32,739 --> 00:33:34,166
Scott: But, you know, twenty four lectures.

464
00:33:34,226 --> 00:33:34,447
Rym: Wow.

465
00:33:34,467 --> 00:33:37,963
Rym: This gives you the syllabus, like all the course material, the lecture.

466
00:33:37,983 --> 00:33:39,087
Scott: It's an online course.

467
00:33:39,128 --> 00:33:39,730
Scott: What do you think it is?

468
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:40,653
Rym: The exam.

469
00:33:40,713 --> 00:33:40,994
Rym: Cool.

470
00:33:42,058 --> 00:33:42,239
Scott: Yeah.

471
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:49,493
Scott: If you want to take the exam and to prove that you passed you, I don't think they have a thing where you can actually get like a any kind of certificate thing.

472
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:51,260
Scott: But, you know, you can certify yourself.

473
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:51,681
Scott: Yeah.

474
00:33:51,701 --> 00:33:54,012
Scott: You know, you know, you know that you did it, that you that you're.

475
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:58,466
Scott: I mean, you know, anyway, you stop in the moment.

476
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:00,473
Rym: That clock rang.

477
00:34:00,754 --> 00:34:01,677
Rym: We're reading the tale again.

478
00:34:01,697 --> 00:34:03,262
Rym: Gee, yeah.

479
00:34:03,804 --> 00:34:04,867
Rym: He's doing his thing.

480
00:34:04,887 --> 00:34:07,696
Scott: And it's getting he is not a good warm out.

481
00:34:07,736 --> 00:34:09,882
Rym: He is not a bad person, but he is a person.

482
00:34:09,902 --> 00:34:11,629
Rym: And he gets into trouble.

483
00:34:12,672 --> 00:34:14,679
Rym: And not all of it is his fault.

484
00:34:16,241 --> 00:34:17,545
Rym: And it's hard to really like.

485
00:34:17,587 --> 00:34:20,739
Rym: I got to read more to see like where the arc of his arrow is going.

486
00:34:22,021 --> 00:34:23,772
Scott: Yeah, it's getting warm out and reading books.

487
00:34:24,114 --> 00:34:27,831
Scott: If you're going to read books, why not start with the first book?

488
00:34:28,172 --> 00:34:35,300
Scott: Well, first, not first book, but first novel, the first like ever narrative novel, the first novel ever written by humans.

489
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,135
Scott: There is no debate about this, that there was some other first novel.

490
00:34:38,216 --> 00:34:39,842
Scott: This is the one, right?

491
00:34:39,924 --> 00:34:42,835
Scott: It's volume one of novels written by humans.

492
00:34:43,076 --> 00:34:44,581
Scott: Number one, where else are you going to start?

493
00:34:44,621 --> 00:34:44,842
Scott: Right.

494
00:34:46,045 --> 00:34:49,896
Scott: And so, yeah, that's that's the book club book.

495
00:34:49,936 --> 00:34:59,959
Scott: We are going to talk about it at some point in the future, maybe by the end of the maybe by the end of the year, probably by the end of the year, because it may be, but it's not that long.

496
00:34:59,999 --> 00:35:10,061
Rym: And again, my only advice to you, if you're going to pick this up and read it along with us, is that you might like not understand exactly what happened in like one specific part of what chapter.

497
00:35:10,784 --> 00:35:12,571
Rym: My advice is to just roll with it.

498
00:35:12,651 --> 00:35:14,819
Rym: And usually things start to make sense later.

499
00:35:14,859 --> 00:35:16,004
Rym: if you didn't make sense right away.

500
00:35:16,024 --> 00:35:22,130
Rym: And if a detail seems like it was dropped and it never comes up again, also, don't worry about it too much.

501
00:35:23,033 --> 00:35:25,061
Rym: It's not that important to the narrative in the story.

502
00:35:25,142 --> 00:35:26,388
Rym: Like you'll see what I mean when you read it.

503
00:35:26,789 --> 00:35:31,690
Rym: It's the style is a little bit archaic, partly due to translation and also when it was written.

504
00:35:32,212 --> 00:35:34,863
Rym: So a lot of things are referenced very obliquely.

505
00:35:34,963 --> 00:35:38,220
Rym: And even with the translation, it is very easy to miss those references.

506
00:35:38,781 --> 00:35:47,913
Rym: Unless I was taking a class doing lit crit, I don't know if it's worth it to you to like fully internalize every single detail and nuance of every chapter.

507
00:35:47,934 --> 00:35:51,950
Rym: I would recommend trying to just enjoy the story and just roll with it.

508
00:35:52,252 --> 00:35:53,860
Rym: I think you'll just have more fun with the book.

509
00:35:54,701 --> 00:36:00,241
Scott: Yeah, I'm just trying to understand basically the big picture of what happened in each chapter, right?

510
00:36:00,261 --> 00:36:01,507
Scott: The current state of things.

511
00:36:01,828 --> 00:36:04,160
Scott: And also enjoy, there's a lot of poetry to enjoy.

512
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:04,803
Rym: There is.

513
00:36:04,823 --> 00:36:06,091
Rym: It's good poetry too.

514
00:36:06,172 --> 00:36:07,480
Rym: Even through translation, it shines.

515
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:08,521
Rym: Yeah.

516
00:36:08,862 --> 00:36:09,123
Scott: All right.

517
00:36:09,646 --> 00:36:10,028
Rym: All right.

518
00:36:10,369 --> 00:36:12,559
Rym: So golf, gonna review golf.

519
00:36:13,441 --> 00:36:14,766
Scott: There's a lot to say about golf.

520
00:36:14,987 --> 00:36:25,325
Scott: You know, we could, you got the actual sport, you got mini golf, you got video game golf, you got golf like things that, you know, are effectively golf, but aren't right.

521
00:36:25,646 --> 00:36:42,411
Rym: And golf is interesting in that it has both like huge positives and also extreme negatives ranging from cultures of and histories of racism to pretty egregious, like land usage and resource allocation.

522
00:36:42,451 --> 00:36:47,065
Scott: The one of the best tweets I saw recently, maybe I'll find the link or not.

523
00:36:47,145 --> 00:36:47,486
Scott: I don't know.

524
00:36:47,546 --> 00:36:59,700
Scott: But someone tweeted, they said, maybe I'll stop using the term Western civilization and start using the term golf playing nations.

525
00:37:01,463 --> 00:37:11,956
Scott: And they had a map that of the world and they highlighted in green, like, you know, golf courses, like per area or whatever, something along those lines.

526
00:37:12,518 --> 00:37:19,423
Scott: And it was like, pretty much like US, UK, Europe, you know, a little bit of South Africa, Scotland.

527
00:37:19,644 --> 00:37:26,489
Rym: And yeah, obviously that, you know, the whole island of civilization, six golf courses are literally like the national building of Scotland.

528
00:37:27,312 --> 00:37:27,513
Rym: Right.

529
00:37:27,553 --> 00:37:36,108
Scott: Like it's like, it's like, you look at where the golf courses are and it's like, oh, it's where all the white colonizers live and somewhat adjacent places.

530
00:37:36,168 --> 00:37:36,288
Scott: Right.

531
00:37:36,309 --> 00:37:47,813
Scott: Cause golf is also big in, you know, Korea, Japan, you know, and Singapore, I think also likes golf, but they don't have that much land golf course, plus two gold, Dubai, Dubai loves golf, right?

532
00:37:47,993 --> 00:37:50,582
Rym: Culture bonus if adjacent to an entertainment complex.

533
00:37:51,726 --> 00:37:51,946
Scott: Right.

534
00:37:52,027 --> 00:37:55,618
Scott: So, uh, so yeah, let's guess that's where we're on it.

535
00:37:55,638 --> 00:37:57,383
Scott: Let's talk about the negatives of golf, right?

536
00:37:57,403 --> 00:38:07,956
Scott: So it's this sport, but it's a sport that is extremely damaging to the world in terms of its environmental damage to the places where they make a golf course.

537
00:38:08,438 --> 00:38:12,893
Rym: It requires amount of land area to be playable and right.

538
00:38:13,094 --> 00:38:14,599
Rym: You can't really change that land area.

539
00:38:14,619 --> 00:38:17,813
Rym: So you have to have a lot of different golf courses further exacerbating it.

540
00:38:18,355 --> 00:38:30,012
Rym: And that land area has to be extremely carefully cultivated, which I don't think there's any way to do that without huge amounts of pesticides and, uh, intervention in local ecology.

541
00:38:30,594 --> 00:38:33,081
Scott: It's also a very bad usage of land, right?

542
00:38:33,222 --> 00:38:35,616
Scott: Even if you have, first of all, you've got a private country club.

543
00:38:35,637 --> 00:38:37,145
Scott: That's already a huge problem.

544
00:38:37,165 --> 00:38:38,151
Scott: You don't even need to go into that.

545
00:38:38,171 --> 00:38:41,004
Rym: It's just, I got some things to say about public golf clubs, but we'll save that.

546
00:38:41,326 --> 00:38:43,976
Scott: a public golf course is better than a private one.

547
00:38:44,298 --> 00:38:44,860
Scott: That is true.

548
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,149
Scott: However, consider this, right?

549
00:38:47,189 --> 00:38:52,652
Scott: Like, you know, up in the Bronx, there's, I think it's actually the oldest public golf course in the, in the country, maybe.

550
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,154
Scott: Right.

551
00:38:53,756 --> 00:38:55,262
Rym: Uh, I think so it's, it's up there.

552
00:38:55,282 --> 00:38:56,106
Rym: It is famous.

553
00:38:56,126 --> 00:38:58,236
Scott: The one, the one we bike, the one we bike through.

554
00:38:58,256 --> 00:38:58,537
Scott: Yeah.

555
00:38:58,618 --> 00:39:08,955
Scott: But the, but if you look at the amount of like square miles, the amount of space that that takes up, and then you compare that to, even if it's getting a lot of use, right?

556
00:39:08,975 --> 00:39:19,638
Scott: Like every tea time is filled up with people using it, the number of people using it and like the amount of like, you know, I guess benefit to society that that provides those people playing golf.

557
00:39:19,678 --> 00:39:21,326
Scott: Cause you know, you're playing a sport, right?

558
00:39:21,366 --> 00:39:25,344
Scott: That's a Ben is benefit society as much as having public tennis courts or, you know, right.

559
00:39:25,846 --> 00:39:34,998
Scott: But the amount of land and cost of that public golf course compared to benefit versus what that land could otherwise be used for since it is public land.

560
00:39:35,499 --> 00:39:35,680
Scott: Right.

561
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:43,885
Scott: Especially if it is next to an urban center or major land could be, that land is so huge compared to like a tennis court.

562
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:51,032
Scott: If you used it for public housing or just a regular public park, that could be another central park, like just right.

563
00:39:51,113 --> 00:39:57,700
Scott: It's like, and you're using it for a golf course that a relatively small number of people get to enjoy, even though it's public.

564
00:39:58,242 --> 00:39:58,503
Scott: Right.

565
00:39:58,924 --> 00:40:00,089
Scott: It's like, that's not great.

566
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:01,213
Rym: Yeah.

567
00:40:01,313 --> 00:40:08,754
Rym: And like compare this even to other high impact things like skiing, like not, I'm not going to try to defend skiing here, but downhill, you're not going to live on a mountain though.

568
00:40:08,774 --> 00:40:11,329
Scott: You can't, you're skiing doesn't displace public housing display.

569
00:40:11,369 --> 00:40:21,289
Rym: It has other environmental impacts, but indeed skiing mountains, like an East coast, like hunter mountain, for an example, it basically sacrifices one mountain and like local infrastructure around it.

570
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:35,623
Rym: But the sheer number of people using it, if you ignore the moral judgment of, if it's a good use of resources, the number of people per unit hour of enjoyment of that, of one like piddly ski mountain is probably better than golf.

571
00:40:35,844 --> 00:40:39,000
Rym: It's probably more than like every golf course in downstate New York combined.

572
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:39,441
Scott: Right.

573
00:40:39,461 --> 00:40:46,335
Scott: Obviously, you know, every different, you know, sport that uses like, you could, we could measure like how much damage does this basketball court do.

574
00:40:46,375 --> 00:40:48,864
Scott: We just paved over some, you know, nature, right.

575
00:40:48,924 --> 00:40:50,469
Scott: Even though it's a small basketball court.

576
00:40:50,509 --> 00:40:55,002
Rym: Golf is the worst one.

577
00:40:56,004 --> 00:41:03,869
Rym: You need enough space for like an entire community for one hole that like four white dudes are going to play golf on for like an hour.

578
00:41:03,889 --> 00:41:03,990
Rym: Right.

579
00:41:04,893 --> 00:41:09,435
Scott: Think about like, you know, there's a lot of like desert golf courses and they're like watering them.

580
00:41:09,475 --> 00:41:15,623
Scott: And when you think about like, you know, they're wasting their water on that in like an Arizona desert, they have a golf, you know, stuff like that.

581
00:41:15,643 --> 00:41:31,292
Rym: Now, a couple of this social impact the game, despite like good, cheap golf clubs exist, but the cost of actually playing golf is high enough to where most people can't actually do it, even if they want to.

582
00:41:31,313 --> 00:41:33,180
Scott: It's not as bad as ice hockey.

583
00:41:33,781 --> 00:41:33,941
Rym: Nope.

584
00:41:33,961 --> 00:41:38,636
Rym: Ice hockey is way worse on that front, but it's still pretty bad.

585
00:41:38,656 --> 00:41:38,937
Scott: Right.

586
00:41:39,278 --> 00:41:43,916
Scott: Um, you know, which clubs you have probably won't matter unless you're a pro, right?

587
00:41:43,977 --> 00:41:46,915
Scott: You just got to get some clubs, you know, it's like same thing with a bowling ball.

588
00:41:46,935 --> 00:41:53,085
Scott: It's like, yeah, an expensive bowling ball is better if you're pro, but if you're not, you just got to be, you know, any ball will do right.

589
00:41:53,105 --> 00:41:55,394
Scott: The ball from the bowling alley is fine.

590
00:41:55,575 --> 00:41:55,756
Scott: Right.

591
00:41:55,896 --> 00:41:56,057
Scott: Yep.

592
00:41:56,439 --> 00:41:56,740
Scott: Oh yeah.

593
00:41:58,142 --> 00:42:02,377
Rym: I'm looking to see how much you said it like cheap golf clubs costs.

594
00:42:02,397 --> 00:42:03,902
Scott: You can get cheap golf clubs.

595
00:42:03,963 --> 00:42:07,675
Scott: It's fine, but it's like golf is still expensive to play.

596
00:42:07,835 --> 00:42:14,459
Scott: Even on like a public course, you have to get to it right with golf clubs, which probably requires like a car.

597
00:42:14,479 --> 00:42:18,116
Scott: I've seen people with golf clubs on the subway occasionally, but you got to get there.

598
00:42:18,177 --> 00:42:24,541
Rym: I can count the number of times I've seen someone with golf clubs on the subway who was not going to or from the airport on one hand.

599
00:42:25,364 --> 00:42:28,492
Scott: It's always a hundred percent of the time as a white dude.

600
00:42:29,234 --> 00:42:31,962
Scott: Uh, anyway, uh, you got to get there.

601
00:42:31,982 --> 00:42:33,408
Scott: You can probably get to get there early.

602
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:36,140
Scott: It takes a very long time to play golf.

603
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:36,400
Rym: Yep.

604
00:42:36,461 --> 00:42:43,148
Rym: You've got to have an idle, like half day on a weekend or not have a job that requires you have to have people to play it with.

605
00:42:43,429 --> 00:42:45,678
Scott: You have to have like good weather, right?

606
00:42:45,758 --> 00:42:54,146
Scott: It's like the circumstances for playing golf is like, it really limits it to just the privileged class of people on earth.

607
00:42:54,227 --> 00:42:54,507
Scott: Right.

608
00:42:55,109 --> 00:43:00,426
Scott: Um, you know, like soccer, which is get a ball, walk outside, play soccer at the end.

609
00:43:00,526 --> 00:43:00,827
Scott: Right.

610
00:43:01,249 --> 00:43:02,333
Scott: But the exact opposite.

611
00:43:02,353 --> 00:43:02,433
Scott: Okay.

612
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:06,733
Rym: So like under 300 bucks, you can get a full enough set of cheap golf clubs.

613
00:43:06,753 --> 00:43:07,818
Rym: Like that's less than I paid for.

614
00:43:07,858 --> 00:43:13,369
Scott: If you're buying, if you're buying new, I'm sure you can go on eBay and buy some used golf clubs that are fine as long as you're not bent or whatever.

615
00:43:13,389 --> 00:43:13,530
Rym: Yeah.

616
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:15,120
Rym: A couple of hundred bucks to get like everything.

617
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:18,956
Rym: I have known people who played with like a non complete set cause.

618
00:43:18,976 --> 00:43:19,740
Rym: that's just what they had.

619
00:43:20,401 --> 00:43:21,505
Scott: You need golf balls too.

620
00:43:21,686 --> 00:43:21,847
Scott: Right.

621
00:43:21,867 --> 00:43:22,831
Scott: But those you can just get.

622
00:43:22,931 --> 00:43:25,000
Scott: also, I've gotten free golf balls.

623
00:43:26,823 --> 00:43:27,144
Scott: Sure.

624
00:43:27,204 --> 00:43:27,385
Rym: Yeah.

625
00:43:27,566 --> 00:43:33,364
Rym: I just, I've, I've, I've saw a clip from that episode of Beavis and Funhead recently.

626
00:43:33,384 --> 00:43:33,866
Rym: Unrelated.

627
00:43:34,728 --> 00:43:44,720
Rym: So, but there's also this social history, especially in America where country, a lot of golf courses were private clubs, many of which were white only.

628
00:43:45,641 --> 00:43:45,842
Scott: Yup.

629
00:43:45,942 --> 00:43:48,791
Scott: And on top of that, rich only.

630
00:43:49,433 --> 00:43:51,540
Rym: Like a lot of them didn't even allow women to be members.

631
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:56,020
Rym: Some of them are effectively still like that today, even though that's illegal.

632
00:43:56,740 --> 00:44:00,332
Rym: There happened to not be any non white, non male members.

633
00:44:01,215 --> 00:44:02,460
Rym: Wonder what's going on with that.

634
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:03,381
Scott: Yeah.

635
00:44:03,421 --> 00:44:10,756
Scott: These country clubs, which is basically just, you know, uh, it's basically just an estate where you would go to hang out with other people.

636
00:44:10,796 --> 00:44:10,937
Scott: Right.

637
00:44:10,957 --> 00:44:12,484
Scott: So you live in your, you're a rich dude.

638
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:15,096
Scott: You live in your, you know, mansion or whatever you live in.

639
00:44:15,136 --> 00:44:15,357
Scott: Right.

640
00:44:15,718 --> 00:44:17,847
Scott: And then, but no one is coming to visit you.

641
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:20,417
Scott: There's a place you go where everyone else goes.

642
00:44:20,698 --> 00:44:22,305
Scott: All the other rich white dudes.

643
00:44:22,365 --> 00:44:22,586
Scott: Right.

644
00:44:23,169 --> 00:44:27,708
Scott: Uh, rather than going to like the tavern with the local folk, you don't do that.

645
00:44:27,889 --> 00:44:30,360
Scott: You go to this country club where you pay for a membership.

646
00:44:30,822 --> 00:44:33,493
Scott: No one else can get in because it's not open to the public.

647
00:44:33,533 --> 00:44:36,023
Scott: It's only open to your exclusive, rich white dudes.

648
00:44:36,504 --> 00:44:37,628
Scott: You go there and hang out.

649
00:44:38,129 --> 00:44:45,252
Scott: And you know, that culture of having a country club, those country clubs all built golf courses on their land.

650
00:44:45,634 --> 00:44:49,689
Scott: And so that the two things were, you know, inextricably tied to each other.

651
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:50,130
Scott: Right.

652
00:44:50,391 --> 00:44:57,471
Scott: That culture of rich white dude, secret hideout and golf are, you know, at the hip.

653
00:44:58,433 --> 00:45:03,268
Rym: And it is possible to have a country club that doesn't have these problems, but they're rare.

654
00:45:03,288 --> 00:45:04,432
Rym: Yeah.

655
00:45:04,854 --> 00:45:06,662
Rym: Just like social clubs have similar problems.

656
00:45:06,682 --> 00:45:10,421
Rym: There are a lot of really racist and broken social clubs, but I can see a space for like

657
00:45:10,802 --> 00:45:11,283
Scott: modern,

658
00:45:11,324 --> 00:45:22,710
Rym: like nerd focused social clubs, like that have like a building that's almost like a federated, like this is an apartment that all the members of this club can hang out in to play games, but everyone's got to live somewhere.

659
00:45:22,731 --> 00:45:32,880
Rym: Like there's a place for that kind of thing, but you cannot ignore the pernicious and longstanding history of what country clubs, especially golf related country clubs have been in the United States.

660
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:34,821
Scott: All right.

661
00:45:34,841 --> 00:45:38,993
Scott: So, uh, yeah, let's talk about the game.

662
00:45:39,113 --> 00:45:40,457
Rym: I don't like golf.

663
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:44,728
Rym: I've played it twice and I do not enjoy it at all.

664
00:45:45,008 --> 00:45:48,196
Scott: It just, so golf on the one hand, right.

665
00:45:48,216 --> 00:45:49,780
Scott: Is, is kind of boring.

666
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,927
Scott: It's like you hit the ball, you'll walk.

667
00:45:52,008 --> 00:45:54,718
Scott: It's more like hiking than, than right.

668
00:45:54,798 --> 00:45:57,026
Scott: It's like, you hit the ball, you'll walk.

669
00:45:57,046 --> 00:46:02,206
Rym: So of the two times I've done a full golfing at like a full, like let's do 18 holes.

670
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:04,135
Rym: Like just go, just do the whole thing in my life.

671
00:46:04,537 --> 00:46:11,848
Rym: Once in middle school, once in high school, I got to the point where I just wanted to do the holes as quickly as possible, like to get better at it.

672
00:46:11,968 --> 00:46:17,728
Rym: And also you just ran to the ball wherever it was, but everyone else like took their fucking time.

673
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:21,700
Scott: Like a lot of the people who play golf, right.

674
00:46:22,001 --> 00:46:31,136
Scott: Is if a you're not actually caring about the golf and this happens in mini golf and regular golf, you're there for just to have fun, get drunk and walk around with your friends.

675
00:46:31,458 --> 00:46:32,723
Scott: You're taking your sweet ass time.

676
00:46:32,803 --> 00:46:35,754
Scott: or B you actually care about winning the golf.

677
00:46:35,835 --> 00:46:41,579
Scott: In which case, you know, pro golfers, they got to take their time to line up the shot and really concentrate and focus.

678
00:46:41,659 --> 00:46:43,549
Scott: And it's, it's, you know, it's slow, right?

679
00:46:43,669 --> 00:46:45,056
Scott: It's, you know, slower than baseball.

680
00:46:45,117 --> 00:46:48,592
Scott: You got more time between strokes and golf than you do between pitches and baseball.

681
00:46:49,234 --> 00:46:52,525
Scott: Um, you know, it's not a fast paced or thrilling thing.

682
00:46:52,565 --> 00:46:56,095
Scott: It's a very slow, you know, plotting kind of thing.

683
00:46:56,716 --> 00:47:02,475
Scott: Um, but as a game, it's actually not too bad from a fundamental standpoint, right?

684
00:47:02,515 --> 00:47:07,069
Scott: The idea of, you know, you need strength and precision, right?

685
00:47:07,089 --> 00:47:10,660
Scott: You have to cover distance and also accuracy, right?

686
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:14,833
Scott: To get this ball into that hole in as few swings as possible, right?

687
00:47:15,033 --> 00:47:16,357
Scott: That's really challenging.

688
00:47:16,377 --> 00:47:21,300
Scott: Uh, it's also has this added element of the environment, providing a challenge, right?

689
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:32,306
Scott: You're damaging the environment as we discussed already, but the environment itself as a challenger, you get sand traps, you got water, you got trees, you got wind, you got, you know, knows what's going on, right?

690
00:47:32,367 --> 00:47:38,733
Scott: All these, you know, not a lot of the other sports out there other than like wind during like a football game when they're kicking.

691
00:47:39,556 --> 00:47:49,499
Scott: It's like other sports, the weather doesn't come into play very, I guess football also could rain or snow on that and they don't cancel, but other sports are not affected by the environment much the way golf is.

692
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:50,723
Scott: And that's added excitement.

693
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:56,001
Scott: Plus the ruling golf of you got to hit it, wear a lie or take a big penalty, right?

694
00:47:56,021 --> 00:48:02,851
Scott: So it's like if you hit it and it lands on a pile of rocks way off in the woods or something, or it's under a tree, it's like, you just got to deal with it.

695
00:48:03,153 --> 00:48:03,334
Scott: Yeah.

696
00:48:03,394 --> 00:48:04,981
Scott: That's kind of exciting and fun.

697
00:48:05,001 --> 00:48:10,041
Scott: Um, you know, for as, as rare as it happens to professionals, it happens to normal people all the time.

698
00:48:10,101 --> 00:48:10,302
Scott: Yep.

699
00:48:10,683 --> 00:48:20,921
Rym: It's also got a, like a, an equipment factor that is substantial, not in terms of like, Oh, the fancy golf clubs versus the cheap ones in terms of there are a lot of different clubs.

700
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:31,267
Rym: Like you're allowed to bring what 14 with you, but like there are more than 14 kinds of golf with which you're going to use.

701
00:48:31,588 --> 00:48:34,538
Rym: And every club is kind of radically different.

702
00:48:34,839 --> 00:48:42,625
Rym: And you have to have the knowledge to understand when to use all these different kinds of clubs for all these different situations.

703
00:48:43,088 --> 00:48:45,177
Rym: And you're way more complex than you might expect.

704
00:48:45,237 --> 00:48:47,166
Rym: It's not just like, Oh, the one word is the big one.

705
00:48:47,206 --> 00:48:50,802
Rym: And the irons, the small ones, like each one has a specific purpose.

706
00:48:51,605 --> 00:48:56,544
Scott: And you've got the thing is the specific purposes because golf provides lots of different challenges, right?

707
00:48:56,685 --> 00:49:03,560
Scott: One second, you're trying to drive and you're just trying to hit the ball straight in that direction as hard as you possibly can to make it go as far as you can.

708
00:49:04,141 --> 00:49:11,351
Scott: And the next second, like you're trying to chip, you want to, you know, you're chipping is like a separate skill and then putting is yet another skill.

709
00:49:11,853 --> 00:49:15,928
Scott: So it's like, there's all these different things going on in golf all the time.

710
00:49:15,948 --> 00:49:25,240
Scott: Uh, that, you know, as if you're just playing it and you can somehow deal with the slow parts, um, you know, as a game, it's actually kind of exciting.

711
00:49:25,381 --> 00:49:31,605
Scott: That's why I think golf actually works really well as a video game because you're just doing the hitting part only.

712
00:49:31,806 --> 00:49:31,966
Rym: Yep.

713
00:49:31,986 --> 00:49:39,629
Rym: It's like the game covers the, because this game also requires an extreme amount of specific physicality.

714
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:51,110
Rym: And like you have to master these very specific and minute actions and control them in a way that is difficult to learn and difficult to teach.

715
00:49:52,132 --> 00:49:55,549
Rym: And also as a technique diminishing returns after you get the basics down.

716
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:57,714
Scott: Oh yeah, exactly.

717
00:49:58,156 --> 00:50:02,293
Rym: Like, um, playing golf to the point that you can at least get it on the green reliably.

718
00:50:02,313 --> 00:50:12,929
Rym: It doesn't take that long to get that far getting to the point where you can drive it to the final green or like deal with a curve or something that takes a lot longer.

719
00:50:13,029 --> 00:50:16,723
Rym: And then actually being good spend your whole life doing nothing and playing golf.

720
00:50:17,667 --> 00:50:17,868
Scott: Right.

721
00:50:17,928 --> 00:50:29,870
Scott: And then if you manage to get really good at golf, you do make a lot of money because it might be out of scope for this conversation, but golf has a very mature and well-developed professional and amateur scene.

722
00:50:30,091 --> 00:50:30,291
Scott: Right.

723
00:50:30,613 --> 00:50:30,773
Scott: Yeah.

724
00:50:30,814 --> 00:50:38,064
Scott: The money comes from obviously the rich, evil white people, but it's like, if you look, you know, like you look at like PGA tour, for example, right.

725
00:50:38,627 --> 00:50:44,290
Scott: And you know, you can tell that golf, there is some luck and some weather and other things involved in golf.

726
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:51,702
Scott: So you don't see the same thing as tennis where like, it's so skill-based that the same person wins every time until they get old at the top.

727
00:50:51,722 --> 00:51:00,737
Scott: But yeah, it's, there's a, there's like a subset of the pro golfers who are like usually near the top and then get bumped out by age and they get shuffled based on other factors.

728
00:51:00,797 --> 00:51:08,561
Scott: You know, who's better at this course, whose style suits these holes, what's the weather like, who's in a good mood, that sort of thing.

729
00:51:08,621 --> 00:51:08,782
Scott: Right.

730
00:51:10,506 --> 00:51:12,852
Scott: But what you, what was I saying?

731
00:51:13,555 --> 00:51:13,735
Scott: Right.

732
00:51:13,916 --> 00:51:17,547
Scott: Oh, it's so it's, uh, the lock shuffles, the people love.

733
00:51:18,169 --> 00:51:18,953
Scott: it's skill-based.

734
00:51:19,073 --> 00:51:20,078
Scott: I forgot what I was saying before.

735
00:51:20,138 --> 00:51:20,600
Scott: Yeah.

736
00:51:21,082 --> 00:51:25,682
Rym: But if you look at the game mechanically, like there's the physicality aspect, then you break it down into.

737
00:51:26,003 --> 00:51:30,420
Rym: there's the, the game of how many strokes does it take to get you close to the hole?

738
00:51:30,982 --> 00:51:33,913
Rym: And then you play the close game, which is just mini golf.

739
00:51:34,937 --> 00:51:35,097
Scott: Right.

740
00:51:35,118 --> 00:51:47,362
Scott: So what I was saying before, there's the same set of people who shuffle near the top, but the P the number of people who have PGA tour cards is actually, it's not a huge number, but it's a substantial number.

741
00:51:47,402 --> 00:51:53,810
Scott: A lot of people have PGA tour cards, who means you get to play in those tournaments, even though they'll probably never win one.

742
00:51:54,211 --> 00:51:57,788
Scott: Um, and they're probably, you know, not going to be competing for the top.

743
00:51:57,828 --> 00:52:09,267
Scott: But if you look at the payout structure, it's like, okay, you, you have a tour card, you play in a tournament, on some weekend and you came in 40th place in the tournament, right?

744
00:52:09,307 --> 00:52:14,008
Scott: You, you qualified, you played on, I don't know, you, you made it to Sunday and you lost by a lot, right.

745
00:52:14,048 --> 00:52:14,813
Scott: Or something like that.

746
00:52:14,853 --> 00:52:27,850
Scott: You got out, you got eliminated Saturday or something, you know, who knows you make tens of thousands of dollars just for doing that just for one golf tournament in a weekend because that's designed to make sure there is an ecosystem to keep fueling professional golf.

747
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:29,438
Scott: And that doesn't, that doesn't count.

748
00:52:29,498 --> 00:52:33,561
Scott: You know, it's like, if you have a PGA tour card, even if you're like a no name, you got sponsors.

749
00:52:33,662 --> 00:52:35,169
Scott: Someone's paying you to use their clubs.

750
00:52:35,229 --> 00:52:36,193
Scott: They're giving you the clubs.

751
00:52:36,495 --> 00:52:37,901
Scott: Someone's paying you to use their balls.

752
00:52:38,263 --> 00:52:40,631
Scott: So wear their hat, wear their shoes, right?

753
00:52:40,852 --> 00:52:42,600
Scott: You're you make money just doing that.

754
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:48,300
Scott: And it's, that's why I was tying back to, it's so difficult to be good enough to get on the tour.

755
00:52:48,821 --> 00:53:00,113
Scott: that it's like, there is a structure whereby if you do really love golf and want to spend your life doing it, there is a like payout at the end there, right.

756
00:53:00,354 --> 00:53:02,079
Scott: To, you know, if you're successful.

757
00:53:02,661 --> 00:53:03,163
Scott: Yeah.

758
00:53:03,724 --> 00:53:16,281
Rym: So in terms of playing the game, like the reasons I find golf uninteresting is that it takes so much investment to be even competent that it's very hard to make it fun early.

759
00:53:16,301 --> 00:53:20,575
Rym: And it's just not worth the investment considering that you can go do it.

760
00:53:20,675 --> 00:53:21,740
Scott: You can go to a golf course.

761
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,527
Scott: That's like all par three holes.

762
00:53:23,868 --> 00:53:25,234
Scott: And that's like a good place to start.

763
00:53:26,017 --> 00:53:33,244
Scott: Um, but yeah, even there, it's like you could, you know, if you're just starting, you're shanking it off into the woods, even on a par three.

764
00:53:33,344 --> 00:53:38,825
Rym: Now, when more people play and it's a lot more accessible, and I think it's a lot more fun game is mini golf.

765
00:53:39,147 --> 00:53:44,422
Rym: because mini golf, if you've never played it is just that last phase of regular golf.

766
00:53:45,425 --> 00:53:48,715
Rym: So imagine you're playing some video game where we all agree.

767
00:53:48,756 --> 00:53:55,562
Rym: All right, everyone, let's skip the first world and just play one, four together, like in Mario, like we're just going to race one, four.

768
00:53:56,205 --> 00:54:04,154
Rym: So you can zoom in on that one very narrow aspect of the game and then expand the problem space and possibilities of that part of the game.

769
00:54:04,677 --> 00:54:06,325
Rym: And there's a whole as game in there.

770
00:54:06,365 --> 00:54:07,329
Rym: That's real fun to play.

771
00:54:08,271 --> 00:54:08,452
Scott: Yeah.

772
00:54:08,492 --> 00:54:12,105
Scott: Mini golf, I think lacks the environmental aspects of golf.

773
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:13,210
Scott: The wind doesn't matter.

774
00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:13,953
Scott: Yeah.

775
00:54:14,013 --> 00:54:17,853
Rym: There might be an obstacle that's artificial that kind of gets in your way, right?

776
00:54:17,894 --> 00:54:20,909
Scott: But the obstacles add back some of that spice.

777
00:54:21,830 --> 00:54:26,873
Rym: So many mini golf, those are often more luck based, but good mini golf, those obstacles have a skill component.

778
00:54:27,816 --> 00:54:27,996
Scott: Yep.

779
00:54:28,699 --> 00:54:31,006
Scott: Uh, but yeah, mini golf is, is a whole lot of fun.

780
00:54:31,347 --> 00:54:51,170
Scott: I think there's basically that fundamental core of golf, which is get a, you know, strength plus accuracy, get something from here to there, you know, in as few attempts as possible, that core structure you see applied to many other games and those other games, while they are not golf are effectively golf, right?

781
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:54,621
Scott: For example, scorched earth is golf, right?

782
00:54:55,263 --> 00:54:57,690
Rym: How many shots does it take for me to hit Scott's tank?

783
00:54:58,673 --> 00:54:59,074
Scott: Exactly.

784
00:54:59,234 --> 00:55:09,682
Scott: Mechanically speaking it's golf and that, that fundamental game mechanic of golf, it makes for a fantastic game and you see it used frequently.

785
00:55:10,344 --> 00:55:21,500
Scott: Uh, most often in video games that like golf, but also in other, you know, in other games, but I guess anything where you're making attempts or getting closer to something, right.

786
00:55:21,521 --> 00:55:36,087
Rym: Or, you know, anything, how few, you know, here's a video game, Pearl golf, dude, make us function, like make a Pearl script that does something and then take that script and make it smaller and make it smaller.

787
00:55:36,107 --> 00:55:37,233
Rym: And who makes the smallest one?

788
00:55:37,293 --> 00:55:38,157
Rym: Like iterate on that.

789
00:55:38,479 --> 00:55:39,704
Rym: How many characters did it take?

790
00:55:39,966 --> 00:56:03,977
Rym: It's kind of an inversion, but it's a similar principle, but we can't disentangle those mechanics from the culture of golf because one area where I think game mechanics wise golf and mini golf both suffered to an extreme degree, ignoring professionals, but regular people who just want to play these games is that culturally they both have a strong disconnect between people who try to win and people who are there for other reasons.

791
00:56:04,599 --> 00:56:09,193
Rym: And I've seen that blow up in both situations constantly.

792
00:56:09,715 --> 00:56:12,023
Rym: I see every time I've ever gone mini golfing.

793
00:56:12,565 --> 00:56:16,619
Rym: If my group doesn't have a fight about someone trying too hard, some group has it.

794
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:19,148
Rym: Like it is so common that it's a thing.

795
00:56:19,168 --> 00:56:21,616
Rym: And I've seen the same thing happen on big golf courses.

796
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:27,093
Rym: Usually it's a few people are pretty good at the game and are trying to win.

797
00:56:27,113 --> 00:56:34,796
Rym: And a few people aren't good at the game and want everyone to slow down and not actually try to win.

798
00:56:34,816 --> 00:56:36,381
Rym: Yeah.

799
00:56:36,421 --> 00:56:45,447
Scott: I mean, some people it's just a matter of attitude and which, you know, because it's the game provides actually many different things to enjoy, right?

800
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:49,420
Scott: It's enjoyable on to play it on multiple levels.

801
00:56:50,002 --> 00:56:51,727
Scott: People enjoy it for different reasons.

802
00:56:52,068 --> 00:56:56,105
Scott: And if they enjoy it for different reasons and play together, then you get conflict.

803
00:56:56,125 --> 00:57:03,493
Scott: I talk about this all the time, how like the star Wars fan who writes fanfic and the star Wars fan who cosplays, maybe they can get along.

804
00:57:03,814 --> 00:57:08,535
Scott: But the cosplaying one would probably get along better with cosplayers of non star Wars things.

805
00:57:08,575 --> 00:57:16,866
Scott: And the fanfic writer would probably get along better with fanfic writers, other non star Wars things, because it, you, you get along with people.

806
00:57:16,886 --> 00:57:24,111
Scott: you're in the same community when you enjoy things for the same reasons, not when you enjoy the same thing for different reasons.

807
00:57:24,192 --> 00:57:33,489
Scott: So a lot of people enjoy golf, but for different reasons, some people might enjoy golf because it's a nice walk in, you know, a lush green place on the weekend.

808
00:57:33,509 --> 00:57:34,011
Scott: They get, they're old.

809
00:57:34,031 --> 00:57:35,417
Scott: They got nothing better to do, right?

810
00:57:35,778 --> 00:57:40,960
Scott: Some people enjoy golf, uh, you know, cause they actually want to win and they they're trying to practice.

811
00:57:41,381 --> 00:57:49,291
Scott: Some people enjoy golf because, you know, the, the socialization aspect and, uh, oh, we forgot to mention the culture of like business.

812
00:57:49,332 --> 00:57:51,139
Scott: P I think it's lessened in recent years.

813
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:53,770
Rym: Definitely less than golf is in a steep decline.

814
00:57:54,352 --> 00:57:54,613
Scott: Yes.

815
00:57:54,694 --> 00:57:59,293
Scott: But in the eighties, nineties, especially there was a huge culture of business.

816
00:57:59,333 --> 00:58:02,867
Scott: People do meetings on the golf course and make, get deals done there.

817
00:58:02,887 --> 00:58:09,738
Rym: You'll see it a lot in sitcoms from the, from those areas, like working in capital markets and interacting with people from a lot of these different strata.

818
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:12,333
Rym: One thing I've noticed is that the current state of that is like

819
00:58:12,976 --> 00:58:13,237
Scott: people

820
00:58:13,257 --> 00:58:24,983
Rym: who are like around like my level of like working in that kind of industry, when there's a business deal conversation, it's usually like nice restaurants like that level, or if it's a hobby thing, it's like ping pong is really big.

821
00:58:25,665 --> 00:58:26,869
Scott: ping pong is big in the city.

822
00:58:26,889 --> 00:58:27,070
Scott: Yeah.

823
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:27,250
Rym: Yeah.

824
00:58:27,812 --> 00:58:36,558
Rym: Uh, sometimes pool, but then the like rich ish people are golf, but the super rich people, it's all creepy stuff like big game hunting.

825
00:58:37,963 --> 00:58:41,956
Rym: Like that's, that's a thing I've run into a few times of creepy rich people.

826
00:58:41,976 --> 00:58:45,770
Rym: Like they will go big game hunting together and that's their thing.

827
00:58:46,532 --> 00:58:51,195
Scott: I'm actually seeing with the, you know, the Rym level of rich people and Rym, this is the thing Rym does.

828
00:58:51,296 --> 00:58:52,864
Scott: rock climbing is a thing, right?

829
00:58:53,045 --> 00:58:57,240
Rym: But rock climbing is also a thing among, uh, freelancers in New York city.

830
00:58:57,441 --> 00:59:01,013
Rym: Like all the rock climbing gyms have coworking spaces in them.

831
00:59:01,474 --> 00:59:03,000
Rym: It's a weird, yup.

832
00:59:03,141 --> 00:59:06,594
Scott: And then I've seen, I've seen the occasional, there'll be like a trendy thing.

833
00:59:07,056 --> 00:59:08,884
Scott: Like the ax throwing was a trendy thing.

834
00:59:08,964 --> 00:59:11,354
Scott: I don't know if it's still a thing now, but I hope it's fading.

835
00:59:11,394 --> 00:59:14,488
Scott: cause it's not, I hope it's really bad, but it was a brief trend.

836
00:59:14,508 --> 00:59:17,903
Scott: The, the ax throwing, but you can see things of that nature.

837
00:59:17,923 --> 00:59:29,363
Rym: You can see that people who run mini golf places re recognize this problem because almost every mini golf place in America will have a five or six stroke limit, partly to keep people moving along.

838
00:59:30,005 --> 00:59:40,261
Rym: But I'm confident a lot of that is because if there was no stroke limit, the scores among any given group would diverge even more and more wildly leading to even more tempers and fighting.

839
00:59:41,745 --> 00:59:44,555
Rym: The six strokes both lets them shuffle people through faster.

840
00:59:44,575 --> 00:59:54,650
Rym: And it also lets them like someone who's bad at this game will just six on every hole and have less of a fight than if they get like 39 on one hole along the way.

841
00:59:55,350 --> 01:00:01,822
Rym: Cause I, one thing I've noticed with our group is whenever we've gone to play mini golf, there's a set of people who want to play without a stroke limit.

842
01:00:02,425 --> 01:00:14,039
Rym: And there are a number of people who will often not only want the stroke limit, but not want anyone else to play without those limitations like around them or in the same space.

843
01:00:14,059 --> 01:00:22,136
Scott: Well, I think that that's the last thing, you know, and to mention is that, you know, you have this sort of social conflict of people enjoying the game for different reasons.

844
01:00:22,778 --> 01:00:29,765
Scott: And that also ties into like the, maybe the biggest barrier to playing golf is like, let's say you're a lone person, right?

845
01:00:29,826 --> 01:00:34,582
Scott: And you can't, you want to play golf and you don't have anyone else to play golf with.

846
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:37,634
Scott: It's like you go to the golf course, you can't just play.

847
01:00:37,654 --> 01:00:38,055
Scott: I don't know.

848
01:00:38,076 --> 01:00:43,640
Scott: if you can play golf when you're one person, they put, they put you with other people, depends on the golf course.

849
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:51,678
Rym: Like you can, you can often play golf by yourself at a lot of mini golf places are more than happy to let you play by mini, but regular golf, they're going to put you with people, right?

850
01:00:51,718 --> 01:00:53,750
Scott: Who are looking for an extra person, right?

851
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:56,443
Scott: It's like you go to, you know, you got to get in the cart with three other people.

852
01:00:57,086 --> 01:00:58,090
Scott: Um, you know, yeah.

853
01:00:58,111 --> 01:01:02,835
Rym: Well, partly because it takes so long to play a hole and they got to get people through so they can make more money.

854
01:01:03,799 --> 01:01:04,121
Scott: Yeah.

855
01:01:04,201 --> 01:01:05,808
Scott: They're not, I don't, I don't know if any place.

856
01:01:05,888 --> 01:01:11,371
Scott: let you just play golf by yourself alone, unless you're like a pro at your own country club or some shit like that.

857
01:01:11,431 --> 01:01:11,612
Scott: Right.

858
01:01:12,113 --> 01:01:13,820
Scott: Um, maybe there is, you know, what do I know?

859
01:01:15,045 --> 01:01:19,967
Scott: But it's usually, it's like, you're getting, you're getting people together so that can keep a lot of people out of it.

860
01:01:20,429 --> 01:01:20,610
Scott: Right.

861
01:01:20,991 --> 01:01:21,955
Scott: And that, you know, there's.

862
01:01:22,016 --> 01:01:25,732
Scott: no, it's like pick up basketball, you just go to the park and play basketball.

863
01:01:25,752 --> 01:01:25,873
Scott: Right.

864
01:01:25,893 --> 01:01:30,191
Scott: You don't need, you know, to play golf, you have to have people to play it with.

865
01:01:30,271 --> 01:01:31,596
Scott: And that's a huge barrier.

866
01:01:32,238 --> 01:01:45,509
Rym: Um, and I think that keeps a lot of people out, especially when the skill disparity, you can't like, you can't play golf at all until you practice enough to get to this like baseline level and you can go to a driving range for anyone around you.

867
01:01:46,410 --> 01:01:47,255
Scott: Driving range is fun at least.

868
01:01:47,336 --> 01:01:50,213
Rym: So I get, funnily enough, I know a lot, a lot of people, I've done this too.

869
01:01:50,253 --> 01:01:53,612
Rym: I would go hang out at driving ranges, even though I had no interest in actually playing golf.

870
01:01:54,596 --> 01:01:55,218
Scott: I did a lot.

871
01:01:55,299 --> 01:02:01,785
Scott: when I was younger, I would basically, I had these golf balls that were like wiffle, wiffle golf balls, and I would just hit them on my own lawn.

872
01:02:01,965 --> 01:02:02,126
Scott: Yeah.

873
01:02:02,467 --> 01:02:04,034
Rym: Uh, I think I had those same ones.

874
01:02:04,917 --> 01:02:18,494
Scott: And then I would go to like, you know, I would, I never played, you know, real golf, like walking around 18 holes, but we'd go to the, you know, when my dad and grandfather, they, you know, they were into golf in the nineties, I would go to, we would go to the driving range, right.

875
01:02:19,097 --> 01:02:21,767
Scott: Um, and that would hit a lot of balls in the driving range.

876
01:02:21,787 --> 01:02:24,177
Scott: And it was just a fun activity for like an hour or so.

877
01:02:24,258 --> 01:02:26,487
Scott: I didn't take all fricking day, like real golf.

878
01:02:26,929 --> 01:02:30,023
Scott: That's, and it was probably cheaper too, which is why they, and it had a limit.

879
01:02:30,043 --> 01:02:32,997
Scott: You rent, you buy balls, you'd hit them all and you'd be done.

880
01:02:33,017 --> 01:02:36,533
Scott: And that sort of like getting tokens at the arcade, right.

881
01:02:36,553 --> 01:02:38,079
Scott: You spend them all and then you're done.

882
01:02:38,099 --> 01:02:40,930
Scott: Now mini golf is a good thing to do with kids.

883
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:43,359
Rym: Mini golf does have a similar barrier to entry.

884
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:49,180
Rym: It's not as steep for reasons, but basically like if you've never played putt, like putted before.

885
01:02:49,602 --> 01:02:51,849
Rym: mini golf is like stupidly hard.

886
01:02:51,950 --> 01:02:53,477
Rym: Like you will not succeed.

887
01:02:53,799 --> 01:02:56,010
Rym: There's a lot of knowledge and technique and skill you have to learn.

888
01:02:56,550 --> 01:03:05,006
Rym: And I think that mini golf has an extra problem on top of golf because while the golf skill divide is much greater, it takes longer to get to that point of basic competency.

889
01:03:05,086 --> 01:03:13,394
Rym: And it's easier to do so in mini golf people because mini golf looks small and ginsy and has the hazards and the kind of culture around mini golf.

890
01:03:13,855 --> 01:03:19,154
Rym: I think a lot of people assume that mini golf will be relatively easy to get good at.

891
01:03:19,937 --> 01:03:24,032
Rym: And thus that leads to some of the frustration because the game looks like it should be easy.

892
01:03:24,815 --> 01:03:26,079
Rym: And then you struggle with it.

893
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:30,614
Scott: It's as hard or harder than actually putting in real golf.

894
01:03:31,076 --> 01:03:35,593
Scott: It's the skill of putting an extremely challenging thing that professional people are not perfect at.

895
01:03:35,674 --> 01:03:41,610
Rym: But then simultaneously people who play mini golf get really good at mini golf.

896
01:03:41,790 --> 01:03:49,138
Rym: And it turns into a counter-strike situation where like they will just always get par no matter what and you're still hitting six literally every round.

897
01:03:49,901 --> 01:03:50,042
Scott: Yeah.

898
01:03:50,423 --> 01:03:58,089
Scott: The thing that I find I guess frustrating is like when somebody is like, you know, they want to do better, right?

899
01:03:58,109 --> 01:04:00,422
Scott: You'll see it's like someone who doesn't care about winning.

900
01:04:00,442 --> 01:04:02,232
Scott: It's like, okay, they don't care about winning, right?

901
01:04:02,774 --> 01:04:05,125
Scott: And then you'll see someone who's frustrated, right?

902
01:04:05,165 --> 01:04:06,452
Scott: They want to do better, right?

903
01:04:06,472 --> 01:04:07,518
Scott: They're actually competitive.

904
01:04:07,538 --> 01:04:15,707
Scott: They do care about winning and then, but they don't put any work into like changing their technique or anything.

905
01:04:15,867 --> 01:04:20,061
Scott: It's like, you know, I learned how to hold a golf club properly, right?

906
01:04:20,222 --> 01:04:28,320
Scott: It's like, you know, in my earlier days, how to swing it straight or how you're supposed to swing it and how to rotate your, you know, at least the very basics, right?

907
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:28,762
Scott: Nothing.

908
01:04:29,143 --> 01:04:34,750
Scott: Obviously my swing is probably garbage, but at least I have knowledge of the basics and I'm, you know, holding the club away.

909
01:04:35,170 --> 01:04:38,426
Scott: That is not a natural way to hold it, but it is the correct way to hold it.

910
01:04:38,527 --> 01:04:38,868
Scott: Really.

911
01:04:38,949 --> 01:04:41,136
Rym: I play golf left-handed even though I'm right-handed.

912
01:04:42,039 --> 01:04:42,320
Scott: All right.

913
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:43,122
Scott: That's, you know, whatever.

914
01:04:43,142 --> 01:04:54,238
Scott: But I see people will be frustrated, but will make no attempt to try to figure, change their technique or home or even to like the basics.

915
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:54,920
Scott: Right.

916
01:04:55,422 --> 01:04:59,037
Scott: And if you try to, you know, you don't want to explain anybody.

917
01:04:59,238 --> 01:04:59,479
Scott: Right.

918
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:01,229
Scott: But obviously if you do, they'll just get mad.

919
01:05:01,591 --> 01:05:11,283
Rym: Mini golf definitely specifically has a, the cultural expectation of most people is that they, no one, like no one should treat it seriously enough to give advice.

920
01:05:11,946 --> 01:05:15,178
Rym: And that's an aspect that I think is important to think about.

921
01:05:15,218 --> 01:05:23,530
Rym: with games in general, the culture and setting around a game can actually set expectations that may or may not match the reality of the game.

922
01:05:23,891 --> 01:05:25,998
Rym: And mini golf is almost a perfect storm of that.

923
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:31,517
Rym: Mini golf is an extremely high skill game that has the appearance of a random game.

924
01:05:31,918 --> 01:05:38,138
Rym: And that disconnect can lead to the kinds of social angst that occurs on many mini golf courses.

925
01:05:38,158 --> 01:05:38,861
Rym: Right.

926
01:05:39,162 --> 01:05:49,311
Scott: And that same, you know, those same social things are tied in with the, you know, excluding people on a, you know, on a higher level.

927
01:05:49,532 --> 01:05:49,813
Scott: Right.

928
01:05:50,234 --> 01:05:51,859
Scott: It's all part of the same deal.

929
01:05:52,801 --> 01:05:57,616
Scott: Um, so yeah, golf is, is, is way too much going on in golf historically.

930
01:05:57,636 --> 01:05:58,258
Scott: Right.

931
01:05:58,579 --> 01:06:09,872
Scott: Uh, but the, I think the, the key positive of golf is that the fundamental game on a mechanical level of, you know, do a thing, you know, in as few steps as possible.

932
01:06:09,892 --> 01:06:10,855
Scott: Right.

933
01:06:11,356 --> 01:06:15,066
Scott: Uh, and having to use multiple different skills, right.

934
01:06:15,146 --> 01:06:18,414
Scott: Strength and accuracy and FNS and such, right.

935
01:06:18,956 --> 01:06:29,532
Scott: Um, together and not just like one skill, um, make for an exciting formula, but a lot of the things you put around that formula obviously are going to make a huge difference.

936
01:06:30,214 --> 01:06:32,684
Rym: I would almost, I saw a joke video of this once.

937
01:06:32,865 --> 01:06:34,411
Rym: I don't know if anyone has ever played this.

938
01:06:34,713 --> 01:06:37,644
Rym: I can Google after the show, I would almost golf.

939
01:06:37,684 --> 01:06:38,869
Scott: I just got to throw that off as fun.

940
01:06:39,009 --> 01:06:39,250
Rym: I played.

941
01:06:39,270 --> 01:06:47,633
Rym: first of all, I'd like to see what golf would look like if someone went for speed run strokes, don't matter.

942
01:06:47,974 --> 01:06:49,379
Rym: First person to get the ball in the hall.

943
01:06:50,765 --> 01:06:51,166
Scott: It would be.

944
01:06:51,207 --> 01:06:53,596
Scott: the problem is it would then become just endurance.

945
01:06:53,616 --> 01:06:53,757
Rym: Yeah.

946
01:06:53,797 --> 01:06:57,712
Rym: The problem is it would become a, who is the best like mid distance runner.

947
01:06:58,596 --> 01:06:58,978
Scott: Exactly.

948
01:06:59,018 --> 01:07:00,887
Rym: The golf part would say I would just, I would hit it.

949
01:07:00,907 --> 01:07:01,610
Rym: Who cares where it goes.

950
01:07:01,690 --> 01:07:02,353
Rym: I'd run over there.

951
01:07:02,393 --> 01:07:06,552
Rym: Cause I'm a real fast runner and I just drag my putter along and take it right into the hall.

952
01:07:07,374 --> 01:07:08,156
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

953
01:07:09,179 --> 01:07:09,460
Scott: But yeah.

954
01:07:09,881 --> 01:07:15,116
Rym: Um, I will say I, uh, I want to play some mini golf after COVID, but I don't want to play real.

955
01:07:15,236 --> 01:07:17,323
Scott: I do enjoy mini golf greatly.

956
01:07:17,745 --> 01:07:23,451
Rym: Um, let's make a point of playing some mini golf and if we're lucky, maybe we can even live stream ourselves playing some mini golf.

957
01:07:24,332 --> 01:07:25,053
Scott: Oh, with our phones.

958
01:07:25,854 --> 01:07:26,716
Rym: I think that could be fun.

959
01:07:28,579 --> 01:07:29,280
Scott: Yeah.

960
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:37,291
Scott: I did do, I did do that thing of the golf.

961
01:07:37,311 --> 01:07:37,492
Scott: Yeah.

962
01:07:38,015 --> 01:07:38,799
Scott: We could go to some of those.

963
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:39,282
Rym: We should.

964
01:07:39,563 --> 01:07:44,148
Rym: I want to go to a good mini golf place because I could talk for hours, but we're at the end of the show around what is it?

965
01:07:44,189 --> 01:07:52,021
Rym: I need, I need a good versus a poor mini golf place, but I think mini golf places would be its own show independent of the concept of golf as a sport.

966
01:07:52,062 --> 01:07:54,150
Scott: We'd have to, you'd have to go to enough places.

967
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:57,804
Rym: I've been to maybe 50 mini golf places in my whole life.

968
01:07:57,944 --> 01:08:01,717
Scott: I've been to, I remember, can I really re when was the last time I went to one?

969
01:08:01,757 --> 01:08:07,479
Rym: I had to like, remember when I was in two times ago, I went to Wildwood.

970
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:08,204
Rym: last time I went to Wildwood.

971
01:08:08,224 --> 01:08:09,290
Rym: I didn't do any mini golf.

972
01:08:09,530 --> 01:08:16,758
Scott: The last time is I had to go to Cape Cod for some wedding and we played mini golf because we were there for extra time and there was a mini golf.

973
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:17,962
Rym: of the mini golf places.

974
01:08:18,002 --> 01:08:22,267
Rym: I have specific memories of there are three and two of them are in Wildwood.

975
01:08:22,428 --> 01:08:26,977
Rym: So, Oh, I guess there was putt putt at RIT.

976
01:08:28,142 --> 01:08:28,322
Scott: Yeah.

977
01:08:28,362 --> 01:08:29,366
Scott: Did we actually putt putt though?

978
01:08:29,466 --> 01:08:32,380
Rym: I remember we did once or twice and we always said we wanted to.

979
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:37,883
Rym: The reason we didn't was it was either too cold during the day or it was too hot during the day or the mosquitoes were out.

980
01:08:39,008 --> 01:08:40,011
Rym: The mosquitoes were the big thing.

981
01:08:40,032 --> 01:08:41,939
Rym: That putt putt was just like that.

982
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:45,715
Rym: I remember the mosquitoes being a very specific problem for us.

983
01:08:45,755 --> 01:08:48,426
Scott: We would, we would go to New Hampshire fun spot for vacation.

984
01:08:48,687 --> 01:08:48,948
Scott: Right.

985
01:08:49,169 --> 01:08:50,755
Scott: And there was a mini golf near there.

986
01:08:50,795 --> 01:08:54,428
Scott: It was pirate themed, but we always called it mosquito land.

987
01:08:54,488 --> 01:08:55,975
Scott: Go there at night to play mini golf.

988
01:08:56,076 --> 01:08:57,544
Scott: And it was just a big mosquito swarm.

989
01:08:57,564 --> 01:09:02,136
Scott: And we played mini golf there anyway, despite that we would put on bug spray and we'd go in and play mini golf.

990
01:09:07,229 --> 01:09:09,437
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

991
01:09:09,497 --> 01:09:14,638
Rym: special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

993
01:09:20,158 --> 01:09:22,830
Rym: Remember GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

994
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:27,549
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, gaming Tuesdays, anime comic Wednesdays, and indiscriminate Thursdays.
