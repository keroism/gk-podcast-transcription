1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,126
Rym: It's Thursday, March 31st.

2
00:00:11,227 --> 00:00:12,090
Rym: I'm Raymond.

3
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:12,733
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:14,078
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,098 --> 00:00:18,323
Rym: Tonight we ramble a bit about why game companies point out flaws and pretend to fix them.

6
00:00:25,869 --> 00:00:26,951
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:30,957 --> 00:00:32,580
Scott: So, what's today's date?

8
00:00:33,121 --> 00:00:35,425
Rym: Today is Tuesday, March 31st.

9
00:00:35,745 --> 00:00:36,807
Scott: So tomorrow is?

10
00:00:36,827 --> 00:00:39,934
Scott: Uh, Wednesday, April 1st.

11
00:00:39,974 --> 00:00:40,516
Scott: That's right.

12
00:00:40,616 --> 00:00:41,860
Scott: And tomorrow, at what?

13
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,084
Scott: Did we decide 7pm?

14
00:00:43,927 --> 00:00:44,509
Rym: Uh, yeah, sure.

15
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:45,352
Scott: Is that for reals?

16
00:00:45,813 --> 00:00:46,254
Rym: Yeah, sure.

17
00:00:46,435 --> 00:00:49,262
Scott: Alright, 7pm tomorrow, Wednesday, April 1st, 2009.

18
00:00:49,262 --> 00:01:02,459
Scott: We will be doing some live streaming type action that will involve many awesomeness, including you asking us questions and us answering them with aliveness.

19
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,924
Rym: It's GeekNights Live.

20
00:01:04,044 --> 00:01:04,345
Rym: Yes.

21
00:01:04,927 --> 00:01:13,513
Scott: So, this will involve Ustream, this will involve Twitter, this will involve, I guess, uh, The Forum probably.

22
00:01:13,734 --> 00:01:16,267
Scott: Maybe we should use the Skype, the GeekNights Skype a little bit.

23
00:01:16,287 --> 00:01:17,494
Rym: I don't know if we'll use that.

24
00:01:17,675 --> 00:01:18,963
Rym: I don't want to set that up downstairs.

25
00:01:19,164 --> 00:01:26,462
Scott: Yeah, but, you know, just for people to send in messages, you know, not to talk, but to, uh, you know, just a way for people to get their questions in live, you know?

26
00:01:26,482 --> 00:01:33,296
Rym: Yeah, basically like Scott'll watch the Twitter and the something and I'll watch two other things and we'll just kinda, we'll go live, we'll go with it.

27
00:01:33,336 --> 00:01:34,180
Rym: We'll see what happens.

28
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:34,461
Rym: Yep.

29
00:01:34,943 --> 00:01:42,735
Scott: Also, the suffice to say, so I created an account for GeekNights on Twitter and suffice to say, so you can, you know, send messages to those.

30
00:01:43,097 --> 00:01:43,860
Scott: I'll watch them.

31
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:53,640
Scott: I guess I'll watch my own if I can manage that many things on my one little laptop and, uh, we'll answer questions, do a little, well, I guess it doesn't have to have to be questions.

32
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,986
Scott: It could just be call us in with whatever you want to say and we'll respond to whatever we feel like responding to.

33
00:01:59,448 --> 00:02:07,563
Scott: You know, that's the beauty of it not being voice of it being, you know, text is that we can just sorta look at it and ignore what's poop and respond to what's not poop.

34
00:02:08,104 --> 00:02:09,633
Rym: Plus, you'll get to, uh, see us.

35
00:02:09,693 --> 00:02:10,882
Rym: We'll be sitting on the couch, I guess.

36
00:02:11,103 --> 00:02:12,773
Scott: Yeah, we'll guess we'll sit on the couch and do this.

37
00:02:12,934 --> 00:02:19,843
Scott: And, uh, so that's, that's going to be a special thing tomorrow and we'll probably also record it and put it on the Internet.

38
00:02:19,864 --> 00:02:24,705
Scott: It's, you know, afterwards, I guess I'll let you stream record it also because you stream can do that.

39
00:02:24,725 --> 00:02:25,850
Rym: Yeah, might as well.

40
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,405
Rym: It's a, it's something that we should have done a while ago.

41
00:02:28,445 --> 00:02:29,310
Rym: We just never thought to.

42
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:32,344
Rym: So we figured, you know, we'll start spring with, uh, something cool.

43
00:02:32,525 --> 00:02:32,926
Scott: That's right.

44
00:02:33,348 --> 00:02:36,182
Rym: Especially since a jobless God, we got a lot of free time to actually do stuff.

45
00:02:36,464 --> 00:02:36,685
Rym: Yep.

46
00:02:37,107 --> 00:02:37,569
Scott: Jobless God.

47
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,657
Rym: Well, one of us does.

48
00:02:39,677 --> 00:02:41,302
Rym: I don't have any free time.

49
00:02:41,342 --> 00:02:41,824
Scott: That's right.

50
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:42,446
Rym: Sucks.

51
00:02:42,867 --> 00:02:44,312
Scott: So that's, that's tomorrow.

52
00:02:44,332 --> 00:02:54,732
Scott: Uh, if you missed it, um, it's recorded and you can, uh, I'm going to go after we're done with the show, I'm going to make sure to, you know, put announcements for it and everything like all over.

53
00:02:54,752 --> 00:02:56,618
Rym: Just remember it is April 1st, 2009 at 7 p.m.

54
00:02:56,638 --> 00:03:01,753
Rym: Eastern daylight time.

55
00:03:01,773 --> 00:03:02,195
Rym: Yeah.

56
00:03:02,235 --> 00:03:07,054
Rym: I don't know if I don't want to get a tweet like a year from now asking me a question on the show.

57
00:03:07,114 --> 00:03:08,861
Scott: And don't come asking me, right?

58
00:03:08,942 --> 00:03:11,391
Scott: Like what time is that in my time zone?

59
00:03:11,431 --> 00:03:15,806
Scott: You can go to Google and you can type in, you can go to Google and type in 7 p.m.

60
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:27,104
Scott: Edt in, you know, um, GMT and push enter and it'll tell you, all right, you don't need to, you don't need to ask us to cover your time zones.

61
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:27,847
Scott: This is the internet.

62
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:29,293
Scott: You have the internet.

63
00:03:29,493 --> 00:03:31,762
Rym: That was quite a preemptive complaint.

64
00:03:32,103 --> 00:03:32,364
Scott: I know.

65
00:03:32,384 --> 00:03:34,413
Rym: I didn't see that being a concern.

66
00:03:34,433 --> 00:03:35,479
Scott: You're listening to this show.

67
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,270
Scott: Someone already came up to me with that concern.

68
00:03:37,971 --> 00:03:38,232
Rym: Really?

69
00:03:38,393 --> 00:03:38,614
Scott: Yeah.

70
00:03:38,654 --> 00:03:41,027
Rym: Well, wait, was the concern that it'll be at a bad time for them?

71
00:03:41,047 --> 00:03:43,180
Scott: No, they were just like, what's that in GMT?

72
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,729
Scott: And I'm like, you can figure it out on your own.

73
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:50,116
Rym: Actually I've with Google, it's getting to the point where I pretty much have to think in GMT all the time at work.

74
00:03:50,216 --> 00:03:50,538
Scott: I know.

75
00:03:50,618 --> 00:03:55,498
Scott: But you know, people just for people out there, you know, Google is the ultimate converter, right?

76
00:03:55,558 --> 00:04:09,056
Scott: You can go to Google and type in like 7 miles per hour in, you know, uh, like furlongs per nanosecond and it'll tell you seven miles to the hog's head yet.

77
00:04:09,277 --> 00:04:23,170
Scott: Google will tell you that all you have to do is literally go to Google and type in like, you know, five, uh, you know, dollars per hour in yen per minute and it'll tell you, you know, so you can, you can type in, convert anything to anything.

78
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,468
Scott: As long as it's a valid conversion, you can't be like seven ounces in miles.

79
00:04:27,508 --> 00:04:28,552
Scott: That doesn't work.

80
00:04:29,495 --> 00:04:40,873
Scott: So a parsecs, I don't know if parsecs are in there or not, but you know, it's got pretty much all metric and English units and also antiquated units that are, you know, precisely defined.

81
00:04:41,074 --> 00:04:41,194
Scott: Yeah.

82
00:04:41,215 --> 00:04:42,900
Rym: You know, like feet and inches.

83
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,001
Rym: Yeah.

84
00:04:43,021 --> 00:04:46,091
Scott: Furlong score, all that stuff.

85
00:04:46,131 --> 00:04:46,492
Rym: Yeah.

86
00:04:46,994 --> 00:04:47,716
Scott: It understands.

87
00:04:47,856 --> 00:04:50,644
Scott: So if you go and you type in, you know, five 34 PM GMT.

88
00:04:53,472 --> 00:04:56,521
Scott: in, you know, uh, I think they get it.

89
00:04:56,581 --> 00:04:57,283
Rym: I think they get it.

90
00:04:57,343 --> 00:04:57,865
Scott: It will tell you.

91
00:04:58,768 --> 00:05:03,488
Rym: Ah, but uh, you know, I was, I was at an ad office for a certain kind of meeting.

92
00:05:03,508 --> 00:05:04,875
Rym: I'm trying to skip all the like reason.

93
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:13,297
Rym: I was there and everything, but it's one of those high rise buildings in Manhattan and we're in the meeting and you know, I'm facing the window and it's this corner like giant conference room.

94
00:05:13,638 --> 00:05:14,160
Scott: It's the window.

95
00:05:14,462 --> 00:05:18,720
Rym: Now I'm looking out the window and it's kind of like this internal area.

96
00:05:18,761 --> 00:05:28,282
Rym: Like the building is a big L so there's a space between the two and then you're looking at the courtyard area and like four stories down is the roof of another floor in the building.

97
00:05:28,764 --> 00:05:29,446
Scott: Ah, alrighty.

98
00:05:29,847 --> 00:05:30,008
Scott: Alright.

99
00:05:30,028 --> 00:05:41,303
Rym: So I'm sitting there and I see two maintenance guys come up to the window opposite me and they're like looking at it and talking to each other and I'm pretty much trying to pay attention to them while sounding like and looking like I'm paying attention to the meeting.

100
00:05:41,323 --> 00:05:44,984
Rym: And then they open the window and I think, oh, they're doing something with the window.

101
00:05:45,004 --> 00:05:55,061
Rym: And then one guy just hops out the window and is now standing on the one and a half inch ledge holding himself in by the bottom of this flimsy ass window.

102
00:05:55,784 --> 00:05:58,052
Scott: Usually they have a little strappy thing that they sit on.

103
00:05:58,092 --> 00:05:58,594
Rym: No strap.

104
00:05:58,695 --> 00:06:01,828
Rym: He's just, he pops out, he's holding onto this thing.

105
00:06:02,109 --> 00:06:03,656
Rym: Then he grabs onto the ledges.

106
00:06:03,736 --> 00:06:05,042
Rym: Now he's holding onto the ledge.

107
00:06:05,062 --> 00:06:08,156
Rym: Let's go to the window and he starts washing the outside of the window.

108
00:06:08,176 --> 00:06:10,246
Scott: That's not how you're supposed to do it.

109
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:13,102
Scott: You're supposed to put this little strap out there with a little hook.

110
00:06:13,182 --> 00:06:18,745
Rym: Yeah, yeah, I think, I think everyone knows that that's what they should be doing, but this is, I don't know.

111
00:06:18,765 --> 00:06:20,613
Rym: No, he didn't fall.

112
00:06:20,653 --> 00:06:21,799
Scott: He did this to be an expert.

113
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:29,861
Rym: He did this to like 10 windows, but one I could, all I could think about was that Ted talk about work and then two, all I could think about was that someone really needs to call OSHA.

114
00:06:31,005 --> 00:06:31,527
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

115
00:06:31,568 --> 00:06:32,894
Scott: Those two things are both correct.

116
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:36,475
Rym: The worst part, he gets to like the fourth window and he gets out and he's starting to wash.

117
00:06:36,495 --> 00:06:38,970
Rym: the top and the bottom of the windows started sliding down.

118
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:42,146
Rym: and now I'm thinking, is he going to notice before it gets all the way down?

119
00:06:42,307 --> 00:06:45,478
Rym: And if it does, will he be able to reopen it from the outside?

120
00:06:46,742 --> 00:06:49,551
Rym: And it's going down slowly, slowly, slowly.

121
00:06:49,652 --> 00:06:52,625
Rym: I see him look and he goes like, ah, and he shoves his foot into it.

122
00:06:53,268 --> 00:06:54,393
Rym: Then he stands there for a minute.

123
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:57,007
Rym: Like he's trying to figure out exactly how to deal with this.

124
00:06:57,027 --> 00:06:59,480
Rym: I don't think he could have lifted his foot without falling.

125
00:06:59,882 --> 00:07:06,129
Rym: So we kind of shimmies down and like worms the window up and jumps back in, collect himself, crawls back out, puts a stick.

126
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,499
Rym: So the window can't close all the way and continues washing.

127
00:07:09,422 --> 00:07:09,743
Scott: Yeah.

128
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:15,567
Scott: You know, while I agree with that, Ted, talk about work, the strappy thing isn't really that inefficient.

129
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:16,913
Scott: It's it's actually pretty cool.

130
00:07:16,933 --> 00:07:21,980
Scott: I mean, it's not like, you know, they're forcing them to use the like, you know, the lift with the winches and whatever.

131
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,292
Rym: You know, the thing is, there is a lift with the winches.

132
00:07:24,373 --> 00:07:24,956
Rym: I saw it.

133
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:25,922
Scott: It was at the bottom.

134
00:07:25,942 --> 00:07:27,008
Scott: It might not have been for him.

135
00:07:27,028 --> 00:07:28,053
Scott: It might have been for someone else.

136
00:07:28,395 --> 00:07:29,640
Rym: It was for window washing.

137
00:07:29,721 --> 00:07:31,147
Rym: I can see no other purpose.

138
00:07:31,268 --> 00:07:38,739
Rym: And if it were not for window washing, then clearly the man who maintains the winchy thing and the man who maintains the window washing need to talk.

139
00:07:39,161 --> 00:07:44,827
Scott: Well, is is the thing is that in the city you'll often see lots and lots of just construction stuff right all over the place.

140
00:07:45,249 --> 00:07:46,836
Scott: But it all belongs to different groups.

141
00:07:46,896 --> 00:07:48,464
Scott: It's like that belongs to the MTA.

142
00:07:48,504 --> 00:07:50,374
Scott: That belongs to its own by the building.

143
00:07:50,414 --> 00:07:52,186
Rym: It was on the building's roof for the building.

144
00:07:52,206 --> 00:07:53,454
Rym: The building is owned by one person.

145
00:07:53,534 --> 00:07:56,550
Scott: It could have been, you know, owned by a contractor or, you know, anyone.

146
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,863
Scott: So it's like you can't go using someone else's shit.

147
00:07:58,903 --> 00:08:03,748
Scott: If you're like, get a repair building and the painter is there and he's got one thing, you can't use the painter shit.

148
00:08:03,768 --> 00:08:04,251
Scott: It's got.

149
00:08:04,371 --> 00:08:05,819
Rym: I doubt that was the case.

150
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:09,016
Rym: I'm pretty sure they just don't want to use it because it takes too much time to use.

151
00:08:09,338 --> 00:08:11,692
Scott: Yeah, but the strappy thing does not take too much time to use.

152
00:08:11,772 --> 00:08:15,433
Rym: Well, apparently it does, because it's a much better idea to risk your life to wash windows.

153
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:18,786
Scott: Maybe guy just so, you know, nonchalant about it.

154
00:08:18,887 --> 00:08:20,172
Rym: Or maybe he's like the tenth guy.

155
00:08:20,974 --> 00:08:21,375
Scott: Maybe.

156
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,261
Scott: Whatever.

157
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:24,706
Rym: Then everyone else noticed.

158
00:08:24,726 --> 00:08:26,734
Rym: And that pretty much destroyed the rest of the meetings.

159
00:08:26,774 --> 00:08:27,538
Rym: Everyone watched him.

160
00:08:28,021 --> 00:08:28,302
Rym: One guy.

161
00:08:28,584 --> 00:08:30,512
Rym: One guy was like, I should yell and see if he turns.

162
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,383
Scott: Should I like shot us?

163
00:08:36,904 --> 00:08:37,806
Scott: How far away was it?

164
00:08:38,086 --> 00:08:39,349
Rym: He was about 20 feet away.

165
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:40,732
Scott: Oh, really?

166
00:08:40,751 --> 00:08:44,063
Scott: You could have got like a spitball over there or something.

167
00:08:45,568 --> 00:08:47,814
Rym: Maybe one of those office rubber band shooters.

168
00:08:48,977 --> 00:08:50,481
Scott: Gattling some nerve action.

169
00:08:50,501 --> 00:08:55,857
Rym: No, I'd felt like it wasn't a day to murder someone.

170
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:56,701
Scott: You wouldn't.

171
00:08:56,721 --> 00:08:57,403
Scott: It wouldn't be murder.

172
00:08:57,424 --> 00:08:59,653
Rym: I'd be manslaughter in the very least.

173
00:08:59,934 --> 00:09:00,637
Scott: I don't know about that.

174
00:09:00,858 --> 00:09:02,867
Rym: That would most definitely be manslaughter.

175
00:09:02,887 --> 00:09:03,771
Scott: I don't know.

176
00:09:05,276 --> 00:09:08,205
Rym: Uh, the lawyers in the forum, I believe will concur.

177
00:09:08,225 --> 00:09:10,855
Rym: Manslaughter in the third degree, in the very least.

178
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,028
Scott: The guy is the one who's putting himself in the danger.

179
00:09:14,088 --> 00:09:16,436
Scott: The nerve does not add any danger to the situation.

180
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,343
Rym: I beg to disagree.

181
00:09:18,403 --> 00:09:28,224
Rym: Plus, remember the legal system in the US, I believe they call it like the paper skull theory that even if you don't intend to hurt someone, if by some fluke and he was

182
00:09:28,244 --> 00:09:31,315
Scott: the one who hurt himself by not following the instructions,

183
00:09:31,616 --> 00:09:35,634
Rym: you go, you go tell a judge that, yeah, I saw this guy hanging off the edge of

184
00:09:35,674 --> 00:09:35,714
Scott: it.

185
00:09:35,734 --> 00:09:38,028
Scott: No, I just happened to shoot a nerf arrow out the window.

186
00:09:38,069 --> 00:09:39,013
Scott: I didn't even see the guy.

187
00:09:39,033 --> 00:09:41,463
Rym: I just happened to shoot my gun out the window.

188
00:09:41,684 --> 00:09:43,009
Scott: Yes, my nerf gun.

189
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,173
Scott: It's my real gun.

190
00:09:44,193 --> 00:09:45,997
Scott: I throw a paper airplane out the window.

191
00:09:46,198 --> 00:09:47,982
Rym: My gun plane.

192
00:09:49,627 --> 00:09:51,312
Rym: Anyway, so it's Tuesday.

193
00:09:51,332 --> 00:09:52,075
Rym: What do you got for me?

194
00:09:52,698 --> 00:09:58,145
Scott: So everyone in the internets is talking about, you know, well, the game developers conference just went down, right?

195
00:09:58,165 --> 00:10:03,749
Scott: So there's all sorts of stuff that came out there and everyone's mostly been talking about this on live thing.

196
00:10:03,809 --> 00:10:25,036
Scott: And basically the premise here with this on live is that everyone now who wants to play fancy games right with fancy 3d and fancy sound, right, needs to go and get a fancy machine, be it a big powerful computer or a multi hundred dollar Xbox 360 or a multi hundred dollar PS3, right?

197
00:10:25,638 --> 00:10:28,425
Scott: Well, cloud computing is all the rage.

198
00:10:28,465 --> 00:10:35,130
Scott: So the idea with on live and fundamentally it's not such a bad idea is that you don't have to get a fancy computer.

199
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,242
Scott: Why should you have to buy a big fancy computer?

200
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,513
Scott: You're never going to, you're, you know, just for games, right?

201
00:10:39,955 --> 00:10:43,748
Scott: Instead we on live, we'll have all the fancy computers.

202
00:10:43,869 --> 00:10:51,230
Scott: You won't have to buy an Nvidia GP or anything and we'll just send the finished rendered video to you.

203
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,420
Scott: The same way we send television to you.

204
00:10:53,441 --> 00:10:54,024
Scott: Hi debt.

205
00:10:54,044 --> 00:11:02,779
Scott: We'll just send you high definition video and you'll just send your controller presses to us over the internets and we'll do all the hard 3d work on our side.

206
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:05,509
Scott: Uh, thus you won't have to buy a fancy machine.

207
00:11:05,549 --> 00:11:14,481
Scott: You'll just basically have to stream video from us and stream a controller button presses to us and you'll have awesome top of the line gaming.

208
00:11:14,501 --> 00:11:20,527
Scott: And in fact, you know, if, if games upgrade and they need even more horsepower, you don't have to upgrade anything.

209
00:11:20,748 --> 00:11:30,441
Rym: Now I feel like penny arcade probably dealt with this in the most summary fashion, but physics pretty much tell me that this isn't going to happen.

210
00:11:30,662 --> 00:11:34,237
Scott: Well, I mean it could happen, but the problem right now is, is this right?

211
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,707
Scott: Online games have lag, right?

212
00:11:36,747 --> 00:11:38,616
Scott: That's even with a really good internet connection.

213
00:11:38,636 --> 00:11:40,890
Scott: You got to ping you to some number of milliseconds.

214
00:11:41,371 --> 00:11:44,782
Rym: The lag is not between me and my computer.

215
00:11:44,802 --> 00:11:45,945
Rym: Exactly.

216
00:11:45,965 --> 00:11:47,129
Scott: My computer and the server.

217
00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:48,134
Scott: So what happens then?

218
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:50,044
Scott: So let's say you're playing counter-strike, right?

219
00:11:50,345 --> 00:11:54,706
Scott: When you push the button on the mouse to shoot, the shooting happens instantaneously.

220
00:11:54,746 --> 00:12:05,964
Scott: There's immediate shooting going on now where that shooting hits, you know, and the people that you see in the game, right, might not actually be exactly where you see them.

221
00:12:06,024 --> 00:12:11,121
Scott: The game uses a predictive model to draw them where they are probably going to be.

222
00:12:11,141 --> 00:12:13,730
Scott: And it corrects, you know, that location.

223
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:17,966
Scott: If the network, you know, tells us that the prediction is, you know, not correct.

224
00:12:18,909 --> 00:12:23,768
Scott: So, you know, the lag is sort of in the back end rather than in the front end.

225
00:12:23,808 --> 00:12:25,094
Rym: It used to not always be that way.

226
00:12:25,114 --> 00:12:28,030
Rym: A lot of early online games, the lag did appear in the front end.

227
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:33,230
Rym: I remember the first time I played Quake 1 online and I had a modem at the time.

228
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:43,310
Rym: So I dialed into this thing and I'm trying to play Quake and I'd hit walk and my guy would just kind of move and not go anywhere for a little while and then jump forward suddenly.

229
00:12:44,251 --> 00:12:44,472
Scott: Yep.

230
00:12:44,492 --> 00:12:56,131
Scott: Now, if these online people were talking about, you know, games like say Checkers or, you know, even something more advanced than that, like, you know, DDR I guess could work, right?

231
00:12:56,332 --> 00:12:56,693
Scott: Kind of.

232
00:12:57,155 --> 00:12:57,857
Scott: Maybe not really.

233
00:12:57,897 --> 00:12:58,580
Scott: No.

234
00:12:59,302 --> 00:13:05,804
Scott: Something that's not a real time game, you know, a game where you take turns or a slower game like Tetris.

235
00:13:05,845 --> 00:13:07,410
Scott: A game like that would work just fine.

236
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,598
Rym: A game like that has no need for a system like this.

237
00:13:09,698 --> 00:13:11,184
Scott: Exactly.

238
00:13:11,746 --> 00:13:14,114
Rym: There are only two ways to look at this technology.

239
00:13:14,976 --> 00:13:19,028
Rym: Either they're crazy or it's a phantom console.

240
00:13:19,309 --> 00:13:20,472
Scott: That's what I was just going to say.

241
00:13:20,512 --> 00:13:24,446
Scott: is this thing really, really reeks of phantom console to me.

242
00:13:24,466 --> 00:13:38,267
Scott: You know, their idea people, in case people don't remember, was that they were going to make a console you plugged into your television because, you know, PC gaming, the major problem with PC gaming is that high end PC game is expensive and difficult.

243
00:13:38,307 --> 00:13:41,603
Scott: You have to install all these programs and get into work and configure them.

244
00:13:41,865 --> 00:13:43,714
Scott: They were like, Hey, we'll make this phantom console.

245
00:13:43,955 --> 00:13:47,209
Scott: You just put the CD rom from a PC game into it and it'll just work.

246
00:13:47,229 --> 00:13:50,101
Scott: We'll just make a system where PC games just work.

247
00:13:50,623 --> 00:13:55,944
Scott: That way people won't have to configure them and fuck with all that shit that normal people can't screw around with.

248
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,954
Scott: Of course, that was nutter failure.

249
00:13:58,014 --> 00:14:01,492
Scott: In fact, that's a lot more difficult than what these on live people are talking about.

250
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:11,485
Scott: Now, I think that there is some potential in this on live idea in making, you know, high end gaming more accessible to the masses.

251
00:14:11,525 --> 00:14:34,935
Scott: the same way Quake Live sort of made it a little bit, but I see the technological hurdles making, you know, actual like FPS game playing very, very frustrating unless the box on the consumer end has more horsepower than they're letting on, thus giving it the ability to at least, you know, do some prediction and things like that.

252
00:14:35,035 --> 00:14:42,914
Rym: But even then, I just, I feel like they won't be able to wrap games in a way, like they'd have to do a lot of changes to the games to make them work well in something like this.

253
00:14:42,994 --> 00:14:45,144
Rym: And I can't see that being worth money.

254
00:14:45,546 --> 00:14:55,043
Rym: All the hardcore gamers already own PCs, people who there aren't that many people who can't afford a fast PC who want to play the small number of games that require the fast PC.

255
00:14:55,084 --> 00:15:02,216
Scott: Well, one one thing that someone was talking about that might actually sort of work out right is, I don't know, people remember back in the day, right?

256
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:02,457
Scott: Do you?

257
00:15:02,498 --> 00:15:05,230
Scott: Well, there's the remember the BS Zelda, right?

258
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:11,053
Rym: The Zelda with the satellite, the one that a lot of people for a long time didn't actually believe existed.

259
00:15:11,194 --> 00:15:13,363
Rym: Yeah, partly because it's called BS Zelda.

260
00:15:13,403 --> 00:15:13,764
Rym: Yeah.

261
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:16,174
Scott: But there was also do you remember the Sega Channel?

262
00:15:17,138 --> 00:15:18,323
Rym: Oh, yeah.

263
00:15:18,383 --> 00:15:18,584
Scott: Right.

264
00:15:18,624 --> 00:15:24,470
Scott: So the Sega Channel, for people who don't know, was you had a Sega Genesis and you put this cartridge in the top of it, right?

265
00:15:24,771 --> 00:15:28,204
Scott: And that cartridge like hooked up to your cable television.

266
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:32,804
Scott: And so what you did is the turret, you tuned your cable television into the Sega Channel.

267
00:15:32,884 --> 00:15:38,691
Scott: almost no, even if you wanted to get the Sega Channel, almost no one had a cable provider that actually offered it.

268
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:39,534
Scott: So it didn't matter.

269
00:15:40,096 --> 00:15:46,522
Scott: And now you could through the cable television as basically functioning as the internet, because this is pre internet, right?

270
00:15:46,984 --> 00:15:49,115
Scott: Would sort of get Sega games.

271
00:15:49,276 --> 00:15:52,972
Scott: You could like, you know, choose demos and then just sort of play them over the Sega Channel.

272
00:15:53,674 --> 00:16:04,777
Scott: Um, so I think what they might be able to do with this right is they might be able to be like, okay, you bought cable television, you bought satellite television, you're in a hotel, you know, whatever.

273
00:16:05,661 --> 00:16:07,490
Scott: Here's a game controller to go to the cable box.

274
00:16:08,031 --> 00:16:08,734
Scott: So it's like, huh?

275
00:16:08,975 --> 00:16:12,550
Scott: And then there'll be just channels you can tune to that will have games.

276
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:16,992
Rym: This is no different than most hotels have that N64 controller sticking out of the TV, right?

277
00:16:17,053 --> 00:16:21,780
Scott: So basically what they're going to do is just, you're going to, when you get cable, there's going to be some channels that have games on them.

278
00:16:22,403 --> 00:16:29,290
Scott: And some people, you know, might, you know, who aren't big gamers be like, yeah, why should I buy an extra box?

279
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:29,672
Scott: Whatever.

280
00:16:29,692 --> 00:16:30,699
Scott: This is enough gaming for me.

281
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:39,739
Scott: You know, how many people out there are just, you know, like they're not, you know, they're not quote casual gamers and that they like, they want to play crappy flash games and that's it.

282
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,081
Scott: Right.

283
00:16:40,482 --> 00:16:46,852
Scott: But it's like they have a PS2, they have a few games, you know, like they get some GTA and some Madden and that's really it.

284
00:16:47,193 --> 00:16:49,140
Scott: You know, that this might go for them.

285
00:16:49,581 --> 00:16:57,372
Rym: I highly doubt that because people like that will just use something like game tab or there, there are a million other solutions that already exist.

286
00:16:57,673 --> 00:16:57,954
Scott: I don't know.

287
00:16:57,974 --> 00:17:02,735
Scott: I think if they can get it on a lot of cable networks that it might, I don't think they will.

288
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:10,386
Rym: I, cause I think honestly that cable networks are going to be dead in not that bad of a set as a separate situation here.

289
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:17,983
Scott: So, but the thing is, you know, think about you get, you get, you go, you call up your cable, you know, your get, you call up to get some internets from someone, right?

290
00:17:18,002 --> 00:17:21,702
Scott: And they just give you a game controller with your, you know, kid modem or whatever it is.

291
00:17:21,742 --> 00:17:35,241
Rym: I still don't think they can overcome what they're trying to do, what they say this is going to do really is impossible for, from almost any perspective because the kinds of games they seem to want to have and the way they want this to work just wouldn't really work.

292
00:17:35,381 --> 00:17:43,041
Rym: And your method is more the idea of you just kind of download the, it'd be like the Roku, you just kind of download or cash the game locally and then just play locally.

293
00:17:43,061 --> 00:17:45,013
Rym: You're not going to be playing these games with other people.

294
00:17:45,555 --> 00:17:45,836
Scott: Yeah.

295
00:17:45,936 --> 00:17:50,435
Scott: The multiplayer aspect is really sort of questionable and the cashing locally sorted.

296
00:17:50,455 --> 00:17:53,973
Scott: That's not what they're doing because they're not going to have any 3d hardware locally.

297
00:17:53,993 --> 00:17:54,978
Scott: It's all going to be remote.

298
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:59,116
Rym: So you can't, I just, I don't think there's any market for this, any viability of it.

299
00:17:59,217 --> 00:18:04,455
Rym: And I, it's either a scam or these people really don't know what their product is.

300
00:18:04,575 --> 00:18:09,170
Scott: I really, I really do think that it is not going to ever occur.

301
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:13,109
Scott: It's definitely has the highest probability of being like the Phantom game consoles.

302
00:18:13,189 --> 00:18:14,073
Scott: It's total vaporware.

303
00:18:14,113 --> 00:18:20,174
Scott: It's never going to really exist, but one day it could exist with faster, you know, internets and such.

304
00:18:20,936 --> 00:18:32,217
Scott: And, uh, you know, there is a way to maybe get some people to use it kind of, but I just, it's going to be something that happens like three or four more times down the road.

305
00:18:32,699 --> 00:18:33,602
Scott: You'll start getting it.

306
00:18:33,903 --> 00:18:36,111
Rym: You're a lot more optimistic about this.

307
00:18:36,312 --> 00:18:38,158
Scott: I'm fairly optimistic at all.

308
00:18:38,178 --> 00:18:39,864
Scott: I'm heavily pessimistic.

309
00:18:40,426 --> 00:18:43,858
Scott: The, I'm telling you this on live company is going to be right.

310
00:18:43,898 --> 00:18:49,281
Rym: There's no way, but the fundamental way that they're going about this, I think is the wrong way to go about it.

311
00:18:49,884 --> 00:18:56,210
Scott: Just kind of fundamentally, I think it could work in the, in the, in the distant future when a internets are faster.

312
00:18:56,592 --> 00:19:07,340
Rym: See, but even if internets are faster, you run into the, I mean, one of the things we ran into at work when we're working on like latency for market data and stuff is the speed of electrons and the speed of light.

313
00:19:07,681 --> 00:19:07,942
Rym: Yeah.

314
00:19:08,303 --> 00:19:13,727
Rym: We calculated the minimum possible latency we could get based on how long it would take an electron to follow the path.

315
00:19:13,988 --> 00:19:17,423
Rym: And then we shot for that and we achieved that and we couldn't get more than that.

316
00:19:18,528 --> 00:19:18,829
Rym: Yeah.

317
00:19:18,869 --> 00:19:19,632
Rym: There's nothing better.

318
00:19:20,114 --> 00:19:20,274
Scott: Nope.

319
00:19:21,138 --> 00:19:23,125
Rym: So maybe, you know, this could work.

320
00:19:23,506 --> 00:19:24,389
Rym: I take this all back.

321
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:29,171
Rym: They could actually pull this off because if they use quantum entanglement, there would be no lag.

322
00:19:29,191 --> 00:19:39,065
Scott: So the thing is, I think that there is a, the problem is while you demand and I also demand say zero lag and like, you know, the FPS department, right?

323
00:19:39,527 --> 00:19:45,895
Scott: I think that, you know, people out there will, we'll deal with some milliseconds of lag between pushing the button and the gun shooting.

324
00:19:45,975 --> 00:19:57,017
Scott: And I think, you know, as long as they can get that to be very small and not like noticeably frustrating, I think that, you know, 50 milliseconds won't frustrate the vast majority of people.

325
00:19:57,098 --> 00:20:06,315
Rym: It'll frustrate us, but not, I think it will frustrate anyone they would be marketing to because using this for simpler games, there are much better ways to go about it.

326
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:21,632
Scott: Like I said, remember like the Sega channel that was just broadcast like you could, it wasn't, but what it would do is it would bring like high end 3d type of HD FPSs and things to people who currently can't play those things at all because inaccessible to them.

327
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,725
Rym: I don't think they'll be able to achieve that on any level.

328
00:20:25,388 --> 00:20:28,604
Scott: I don't think they will now, but you know, some years from now, I don't know.

329
00:20:28,624 --> 00:20:29,288
Rym: I'm pretty doubtful.

330
00:20:29,368 --> 00:20:30,916
Scott: Now they're going to fail and be vaporware.

331
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:33,608
Rym: But anyway, there's this other article on slash dot.

332
00:20:33,909 --> 00:20:38,102
Rym: It's called a. game companies face hard economic choices.

333
00:20:38,122 --> 00:20:43,835
Rym: I believe that they might be faced with full life consequences.

334
00:20:43,855 --> 00:20:53,182
Rym: I don't think so, but this is a long article and there's I wonder what is going to happen with the game industry?

335
00:20:53,243 --> 00:21:00,037
Rym: because basically we're running into the situation where one, the economy is down, so people aren't going to pay as much money for coming back now.

336
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:01,804
Rym: Well, the stock market's coming back.

337
00:21:02,567 --> 00:21:06,808
Rym: That doesn't necessarily mean that the economy is coming back, but to even the economy is down.

338
00:21:06,828 --> 00:21:07,953
Rym: A lot of people are out of work.

339
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:15,222
Rym: Jobs are, you know, there's trouble on that front and games haven't gotten cheaper and in fact, in many ways have gotten more expensive.

340
00:21:16,005 --> 00:21:28,777
Rym: and not only that, games cost a lot more to make now than they used to, at least for consoles since I'm not really going to worry about pc games because they're still kind of the minority and world of warcraft really makes the rest of them not matter at all.

341
00:21:29,701 --> 00:21:32,552
Scott: But like steam is starting to make some moves though.

342
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:33,658
Rym: They are bit by bit.

343
00:21:33,678 --> 00:21:37,156
Rym: But then again, the games that are really rocking steam are the cheap games now.

344
00:21:37,658 --> 00:21:39,709
Scott: Well, we're not going to get into that discussion.

345
00:21:39,729 --> 00:21:44,434
Rym: Well, there's that whole thing where when they lowered the price of left for dead, the sales skyrocketed to it like a crazy.

346
00:21:44,494 --> 00:21:49,214
Scott: It's like they lowered the price by half, but the sales jumped more than 50%.

347
00:21:49,214 --> 00:21:52,046
Scott: thus they made more money by selling it for a lower price.

348
00:21:52,126 --> 00:21:58,435
Rym: Yes, that's relevant to what's going on here because one of the figures they bring up is that it costs about $25 million.

349
00:21:58,475 --> 00:22:01,245
Rym: They say to make a game for a current generation console.

350
00:22:01,867 --> 00:22:02,891
Scott: Oh, a big fancy one.

351
00:22:03,092 --> 00:22:07,065
Rym: Well, which they consider to be a normal game like in a title.

352
00:22:07,246 --> 00:22:07,507
Scott: Okay.

353
00:22:07,928 --> 00:22:10,903
Rym: It cost about 10 million to make for the last generation.

354
00:22:10,943 --> 00:22:14,861
Rym: I don't know if that includes inflation or not, but even if it does, that's still a lot.

355
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:16,126
Rym: That's a big difference.

356
00:22:16,327 --> 00:22:20,662
Rym: And gameplay wise, there aren't that many differences between the two generations.

357
00:22:21,605 --> 00:22:33,827
Scott: And now that sales are down and there's so much competition, I know that money goes into, you know, voice actors and 3d and fancy graphics and, and you know, mark cut scenes and marketing.

358
00:22:33,847 --> 00:22:34,108
Scott: Yeah.

359
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:42,428
Rym: But the real issue here is that game sales are not what they used to be coupled with the fact that it costs more money to make games and there's more competition.

360
00:22:42,468 --> 00:22:47,956
Rym: because, you know, we talk about this a lot, the whole can't compete with the past, but quake live really illustrates this more than anything.

361
00:22:47,996 --> 00:22:51,192
Rym: We've got a game that came out when I was in high school.

362
00:22:51,252 --> 00:22:51,514
Rym: Yeah.

363
00:22:51,534 --> 00:22:52,720
Scott: Late nineties, quake three, right?

364
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,987
Rym: It's already been made.

365
00:22:54,127 --> 00:22:54,630
Rym: Like it's done.

366
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:56,940
Rym: It doesn't cost any more to make the game.

367
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,583
Scott: It's already done.

368
00:22:58,386 --> 00:23:01,580
Rym: So they just take this, re-release it, put some stuff around it.

369
00:23:01,601 --> 00:23:04,073
Rym: They cost almost nothing to make compared to what the game cost to me.

370
00:23:04,094 --> 00:23:13,530
Rym: I mean, making a website is a lot cheaper than making a 3d game and it's doing well enough to where it's real competition for brand new FPSs that come out.

371
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:13,950
Scott: Yeah.

372
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:20,455
Scott: There's people, there's a lot more people playing quake live than there are playing like FPSs that just came out.

373
00:23:20,876 --> 00:23:26,707
Scott: You know, I mean, I don't know, but what's this?

374
00:23:26,727 --> 00:23:28,211
Scott: What's what?

375
00:23:28,412 --> 00:23:30,441
Rym: So, so how many people are playing quake live?

376
00:23:30,502 --> 00:23:30,964
Scott: Thousands.

377
00:23:31,346 --> 00:23:33,836
Rym: And how many people are playing these fictional FPSs you're making up?

378
00:23:33,857 --> 00:23:35,262
Scott: I don't know.

379
00:23:35,282 --> 00:23:38,593
Scott: There's probably, you know, there's, not a lot of people playing.

380
00:23:38,874 --> 00:23:39,415
Rym: Playing what?

381
00:23:40,518 --> 00:23:49,550
Scott: I don't know what, but that unreal something that just, that was on, that was super cheap on steam, like the newest unreal tournament.

382
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:50,294
Scott: No one's playing that.

383
00:23:50,816 --> 00:23:52,104
Rym: That was a newer unreal tournament, right?

384
00:23:52,124 --> 00:23:52,747
Rym: Not a re-release.

385
00:23:52,908 --> 00:23:55,781
Scott: I'm pretty sure the one they were selling on steam for cheap was the newest one.

386
00:23:57,146 --> 00:23:58,433
Rym: What about the halos and all that?

387
00:23:58,473 --> 00:23:59,138
Rym: Is there a new halo?

388
00:23:59,198 --> 00:24:00,004
Rym: When was the last halo?

389
00:24:00,145 --> 00:24:03,864
Scott: I don't know how many people are still playing halo three, but it's only on the X-Box.

390
00:24:04,085 --> 00:24:05,372
Rym: How many people are still playing counter-strike?

391
00:24:05,392 --> 00:24:07,566
Scott: More people are playing counter-strike than anything else ever.

392
00:24:07,647 --> 00:24:08,813
Scott: And it will always be that way.

393
00:24:08,974 --> 00:24:13,559
Rym: Actually, what was surprising, I went to play counter-strike the other day and all the servers were still there.

394
00:24:13,579 --> 00:24:20,022
Rym: And for, for a lark, I logged into a team fortress two to take a peak and a lot of people are playing.

395
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:20,805
Rym: Yup.

396
00:24:21,406 --> 00:24:25,263
Rym: But they're all playing the same maps when it came out and they're all playing.

397
00:24:25,283 --> 00:24:27,833
Rym: Like it's weird how the game is so static now.

398
00:24:29,739 --> 00:24:31,565
Scott: But anyway, people have played left for dead also.

399
00:24:31,966 --> 00:24:32,729
Rym: And Reggie even.

400
00:24:32,749 --> 00:24:39,114
Rym: they have a quote from him that they say it takes about 1 million sales on the Wii to turn a profit for the average game.

401
00:24:39,194 --> 00:24:40,098
Scott: Well, for a big game.

402
00:24:40,419 --> 00:24:45,946
Rym: I mean, if you make, if you may keep saying big game, but all the people in these articles are saying average game.

403
00:24:46,167 --> 00:24:49,543
Scott: Well, I'm talking about like, you know, if you stretch, if you break out, right.

404
00:24:49,563 --> 00:24:55,669
Scott: You can't tell me right that you need to sell a million copies of like Tetris for the DS to make money.

405
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:59,525
Scott: You know, you can't tell me that it takes a million sales of mega man.

406
00:24:59,605 --> 00:25:03,062
Scott: I said for the Wii, all right, mega man nine did not need a million sales.

407
00:25:03,082 --> 00:25:03,967
Scott: That doesn't count.

408
00:25:03,987 --> 00:25:05,939
Rym: They're not counting the virtual console or anything like that.

409
00:25:05,959 --> 00:25:10,845
Rym: They're talking about disc games, like Wii games, games that are in the store with the Wii logo on them there for the Wii.

410
00:25:10,865 --> 00:25:11,970
Rym: All right.

411
00:25:12,311 --> 00:25:21,494
Scott: But you go to the, go to the store and look for like the crappy Wii games, like the ones that were obviously thrown together in like, you know, a few weeks just to like for some licensed property.

412
00:25:21,514 --> 00:25:28,423
Scott: Like, you know, generic cookie cutter platformer for kitty cartoon show number three does not need a million sales to profit.

413
00:25:28,844 --> 00:25:30,591
Scott: I'm just, this is what Reggie is saying.

414
00:25:30,652 --> 00:25:34,785
Rym: But anyway, and the average game on the Wii seems to sell about 150,000 copies.

415
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:36,953
Scott: It's about right.

416
00:25:38,699 --> 00:25:40,304
Scott: If you take all the crap games into account.

417
00:25:41,046 --> 00:25:41,889
Rym: See, I don't know.

418
00:25:41,929 --> 00:25:43,737
Rym: I don't know what these numbers are exactly.

419
00:25:43,757 --> 00:25:46,028
Scott: No, because Nintendo is not going to tell you shit.

420
00:25:46,429 --> 00:25:49,187
Rym: Yeah, but it was interesting that Reggie would say something like that in the first place.

421
00:25:49,429 --> 00:25:51,698
Scott: Yeah, I guess, but I don't know.

422
00:25:51,719 --> 00:26:03,942
Rym: I just, I feel like there's going to be a big change in the industry because all the indications are that games are overpriced and really, but like I think they're overpriced to a frightening degree.

423
00:26:03,983 --> 00:26:13,064
Rym: And I think that the sort of price equal and people just expect a new game to cost between 40 and $60 out of well, because I mean, look, the NES games game out right way back in the day.

424
00:26:13,425 --> 00:26:15,915
Scott: Atari games, the prices were like all over the place.

425
00:26:15,975 --> 00:26:16,196
Scott: Right.

426
00:26:16,778 --> 00:26:20,854
Scott: But when you got to the NES, the price on new games was like $50.

427
00:26:20,854 --> 00:26:21,778
Scott: They were all $50.

428
00:26:21,778 --> 00:26:24,028
Scott: There was really not much fluctuation at all.

429
00:26:24,148 --> 00:26:28,783
Rym: Like not Mario three and we're $60, 65 when it came out.

430
00:26:28,804 --> 00:26:30,830
Scott: But I think that those are retail markups.

431
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:33,140
Scott: I think the MSRPs were always $50.

432
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:39,291
Scott: And I think that that was, you know, Toys R Us and other people, when they saw that this was a big demand game, they raised the price up a little bit.

433
00:26:39,311 --> 00:26:39,713
Scott: I don't know.

434
00:26:39,955 --> 00:26:40,236
Rym: I don't know.

435
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,725
Scott: That's, I don't know that for sure.

436
00:26:41,906 --> 00:26:43,172
Scott: But that's my, that's my guess.

437
00:26:43,433 --> 00:26:52,708
Scott: But anyway, you know, there wasn't a great deal of price fluctuation and it seems like people never really thought about changing the price for video games.

438
00:26:52,728 --> 00:26:55,018
Scott: They just always left it at $50 because that's what they were.

439
00:26:55,078 --> 00:27:06,276
Scott: But in, you know, as we got to finally the Xbox 360 PS3 generation, Microsoft and Sony were finally like, um, yeah, these games are getting more expensive to make.

440
00:27:06,818 --> 00:27:10,635
Scott: And they started to look at the price and they raised the price to $60.

441
00:27:10,635 --> 00:27:11,237
Scott: ish, right?

442
00:27:11,257 --> 00:27:12,020
Scott: For newer games.

443
00:27:12,361 --> 00:27:17,866
Scott: Whereas the Wii said, ah, look, we'll stay at 40 and 50 or whatever, you know, we're not gonna, we're not going to raise the price.

444
00:27:17,906 --> 00:27:25,132
Scott: And handheld game prices have always been around $30 for, you know, a handheld game that was brand new at least.

445
00:27:25,634 --> 00:27:36,149
Scott: And just no one, at least in the United States is like, there hasn't been an actual changing of prices on video games to see what the market value actually is.

446
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:38,399
Scott: And you know, no one's actually ever done it.

447
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,635
Scott: They've never lowered the prices to see how many more you'll sell.

448
00:27:41,675 --> 00:27:44,469
Scott: They never raised the prices to see how many less you'll sell.

449
00:27:44,509 --> 00:27:46,781
Scott: There hasn't been experimentation at all.

450
00:27:46,821 --> 00:27:48,289
Scott: It's just sort of been the price.

451
00:27:48,309 --> 00:27:49,876
Scott: They're what they are because that's what they are.

452
00:27:49,917 --> 00:27:51,766
Scott: And no one messes around with it.

453
00:27:52,027 --> 00:27:57,149
Rym: And I would guess that honestly, that the industry as a whole is, it's not a conspiracy.

454
00:27:57,169 --> 00:28:04,336
Rym: It's just that they're worried that if they start lowering prices, the games are going to hit what they're actually worth on the market.

455
00:28:04,436 --> 00:28:20,118
Rym: And I think there's so much free content out there now, both pirated and legitimate that the, I guess the cost that people will pay in lieu of any other option is very, very, very low to the point that they will not be able to make the big budget games that they've been making.

456
00:28:20,138 --> 00:28:32,325
Scott: Well, see, actually, I think something slightly different is that if you look at steam, right, steam has shown that if you lower the price, right on some crazy awesome game, right, that the sales just are.

457
00:28:32,425 --> 00:28:37,322
Scott: so the numbers on it are just so crazily large that it's all right.

458
00:28:37,403 --> 00:28:43,366
Scott: You know, if you come out with, say, a new Zelda game, right at the same time, can that really be definite?

459
00:28:43,406 --> 00:28:52,951
Rym: Because so they lower the price on some games, those games now not only are they really cheap, but they are competing with far fewer things because you're only competing with things at the same price point.

460
00:28:52,991 --> 00:29:01,896
Rym: Now, if every game was that price, maybe those sales were just spread out and the same number of games would get bought, people would just have more options again, and they'd pay less overall.

461
00:29:01,956 --> 00:29:03,383
Scott: That's a very good question.

462
00:29:03,424 --> 00:29:09,475
Rym: That's what I worry because you don't only you only have so many hours in a day to play games, even if you're in college, I could only.

463
00:29:09,555 --> 00:29:13,690
Rym: I only spent, you know, tops 20 hours a day playing Counter Strike.

464
00:29:13,891 --> 00:29:19,714
Scott: I think what you might see, even if all the games went down to like twenty dollars, right, big ones, right?

465
00:29:19,975 --> 00:29:26,667
Scott: I think what you might see is at first you would see, you know, people going holy shit and they could just have, you know, so much money.

466
00:29:26,708 --> 00:29:32,674
Scott: It's like, you know, the kids who would normally go and sell back a game and then, you know, to buy two or whatever, you know, stuff like that.

467
00:29:32,735 --> 00:29:42,718
Scott: Right now, you're going to see people like buy a shit ton of games, crazy shit, tons of games and sales temporarily for maybe even up to six months to a year would go crazily high.

468
00:29:42,738 --> 00:29:48,501
Scott: You just get crazy numbers of sales all over the place as people buy up all these great games at low prices.

469
00:29:49,284 --> 00:30:03,200
Scott: But then I think over time, as people had these, you know, come to these realizations of having a shelf full of games that don't get played, would go back to just buying, you know, the number of games that they can buy at, you know, whatever price they can get.

470
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:15,705
Scott: But I think you will also see a perpetual increase sales among kids, you know, gamer kids who have, you know, not so much money, but would now buy more games if their prices were lower.

471
00:30:16,046 --> 00:30:46,287
Rym: Well, I think the biggest concern, you know, competing with the past is that unlike other media movies and CG and all these things, at least with video games, the curve of, I guess, technological advancement or the maturity of games as a platform, as a medium, all these things really flattened out in the last few years to the point that the differences in terms of gameplay and even graphics between cutting edge games and slightly older games and then older games and older games and older games is not as much as it used to be.

472
00:30:46,327 --> 00:30:51,645
Rym: I mean, the difference between the Atari and the Nintendo was like VHS and DVD, chocolate and shit.

473
00:30:52,387 --> 00:30:58,910
Rym: But now the difference between a PS two game and a PS three game to many people is not that much.

474
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:01,987
Rym: And people like, I mean, PS two is still the biggest console out there.

475
00:31:02,028 --> 00:31:05,647
Scott: Games are still being made for PS two might go down to one hundred dollars real soon.

476
00:31:05,708 --> 00:31:10,416
Scott: Actually, it is going down to one hundred dollars real soon instead of one hundred and thirty, which is what it's been for a very long time.

477
00:31:10,838 --> 00:31:23,349
Rym: But we're getting to this gameplay and accessibility and just desire wise, flat plateau of gaming, where people who play games are just as satisfied playing a game that came out ten years ago as they are playing a game that came out satisfied

478
00:31:23,871 --> 00:31:26,260
Scott: playing an iPhone game, you know,

479
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:39,591
Rym: even gamers, not not just, you know, 80s nostalgia gamers, but just self-identified gamers will often play a game that's five or six years old because they couldn't play every game that came out in nineteen ninety nine in nineteen ninety nine.

480
00:31:39,611 --> 00:31:40,835
Scott: Yeah, it's weird.

481
00:31:40,875 --> 00:31:46,250
Scott: It's like you don't see really discussions of graphics anymore.

482
00:31:46,611 --> 00:31:57,224
Scott: I think it's actually sort of disappeared, you know, where the you know, I mean, you know, I used to always you know, there would always be like one punk kid or two who would come along and be like, oh, man, this is so much better.

483
00:31:57,284 --> 00:31:58,570
Scott: The graphics are so much cooler.

484
00:31:59,311 --> 00:32:02,788
Scott: That hasn't happened in a very in a relatively you know, I can't remember the last time places

485
00:32:03,411 --> 00:32:03,893
Rym: on the Internet,

486
00:32:03,953 --> 00:32:05,460
Scott: probably, but I can't remember the last

487
00:32:05,781 --> 00:32:06,183
Rym: time

488
00:32:06,203 --> 00:32:16,421
Scott: I had to slap down a punk kid for that, you know, and I think, you know, the we sort of came and they had the right idea in that, you know, gameplay matters and let's change it up.

489
00:32:16,461 --> 00:32:17,705
Scott: But they didn't.

490
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:21,944
Rym: Well, they started to a little bit and then they said, oh, never mind.

491
00:32:22,064 --> 00:32:24,817
Scott: And now they just releasing GameCube games with Wii controls.

492
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,087
Rym: That kind of happened with the DS.

493
00:32:27,127 --> 00:32:28,956
Rym: I remember games like Kirby's Canvas Curse.

494
00:32:29,298 --> 00:32:32,937
Rym: Yeah, there were all these kind of games that were like, let's try to do something different.

495
00:32:33,379 --> 00:32:41,234
Rym: And now the games that do really well in the DS, other than like the cooking mama and those sorts of things, you know, Castlevania, which is just a Gameboy game.

496
00:32:41,777 --> 00:32:44,789
Scott: Yeah, at least the two screens are put to very good use.

497
00:32:44,849 --> 00:32:45,832
Scott: That was a great idea.

498
00:32:46,033 --> 00:32:46,394
Rym: It was.

499
00:32:46,835 --> 00:32:51,147
Scott: And the you know, the microphone, very bad idea, right?

500
00:32:51,448 --> 00:32:52,792
Scott: Local wireless multiplayer.

501
00:32:52,812 --> 00:32:53,294
Scott: Very good.

502
00:32:53,735 --> 00:32:54,016
Scott: Right.

503
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:56,523
Rym: Not integrating it with the Wii.

504
00:32:56,804 --> 00:32:57,687
Rym: Oh, my God.

505
00:32:57,747 --> 00:32:58,209
Rym: Very bad.

506
00:32:58,229 --> 00:32:58,469
Scott: Yeah.

507
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:03,465
Scott: Touch screen, you know, is just, you know, it's it's OK.

508
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:08,790
Scott: It's it's, you know, but it's usually just used as like, you know, menu selection or something along those lines.

509
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:13,048
Scott: You know, games, they actually play a game with the stylus as the control.

510
00:33:13,168 --> 00:33:16,348
Rym: Well, there's that, you know, Phantom Hourglass, which I think did a pretty good job with.

511
00:33:16,368 --> 00:33:17,072
Scott: that was OK.

512
00:33:17,092 --> 00:33:17,735
Scott: I was OK.

513
00:33:18,156 --> 00:33:21,350
Rym: It was an interesting concept and it's worked a lot better than I expected.

514
00:33:21,611 --> 00:33:26,490
Scott: I think, you know, the GTA game actually uses it, you know, as a menu selector down low.

515
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:28,862
Scott: It's like you have a PDA that you can sort of poke at.

516
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:35,995
Scott: So you go to the PDA menu and then you use the stylus to navigate your PDA to check your missions and your, you know, buy ammo and stuff like that.

517
00:33:36,076 --> 00:33:40,895
Rym: But at the same time, like a lot of games that they like Chrono Trigger added the menu at the bottom.

518
00:33:41,558 --> 00:33:44,370
Rym: And it's still just so much or advanced for us.

519
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:46,017
Rym: You could just click where you wanted your units to go.

520
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:51,420
Rym: It's so much faster to use the pad and the buttons in those games.

521
00:33:51,461 --> 00:33:51,742
Scott: Yes.

522
00:33:51,922 --> 00:33:58,104
Scott: But I think that it would be possible to have the stylus be faster if the interface was implemented better.

523
00:33:58,124 --> 00:34:01,440
Rym: And some of those, I guess the gist of all this, you should read the article.

524
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:07,165
Rym: There's there are a lot of interesting tidbits in it that are kind of unrelated and decontextualized.

525
00:34:07,206 --> 00:34:10,435
Rym: So there's not a lot of useful real information in this article.

526
00:34:10,936 --> 00:34:23,850
Rym: But the relevant quote, I think, is, quote, the key is just that more importantly, these are too expensive and there are too many choices.

527
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:24,452
Scott: Yep.

528
00:34:24,934 --> 00:34:31,399
Rym: And think about if they lower the prices, there are just as many choices unless only one person lowers prices and other people don't.

529
00:34:31,761 --> 00:34:39,433
Scott: I think the key is that if you want to make money with games, you have to a make your game as cheaply as possible while still getting it done.

530
00:34:40,014 --> 00:34:41,260
Scott: Be you have to.

531
00:34:41,541 --> 00:34:44,130
Scott: your game has to be different from the other games out there.

532
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:44,594
Scott: No more.

533
00:34:44,674 --> 00:34:47,009
Scott: You know, the cookie cutters are not going to do it anymore.

534
00:34:47,049 --> 00:34:49,783
Scott: You know, another FPS that just looks different is not going to work.

535
00:34:49,822 --> 00:34:53,237
Scott: You need your game has to be set apart from other games for reals.

536
00:34:54,221 --> 00:35:00,324
Scott: Three, you got to get your game on like every platform in the universe, from like the iPhone to the Wii to that.

537
00:35:00,404 --> 00:35:00,585
Scott: Right.

538
00:35:00,826 --> 00:35:05,483
Scott: There's no reason to not put your game on every single place that it can can be played.

539
00:35:05,864 --> 00:35:06,125
Scott: Right.

540
00:35:06,807 --> 00:35:19,438
Scott: And you're going to have to find the price point at which you get the most profits, you know, whether that's one hundred dollars or five dollars or whatever, you got to multiply price by sales and figure out that that's basic economics.

541
00:35:19,458 --> 00:35:20,444
Rym: That's not useful at all.

542
00:35:20,484 --> 00:35:23,037
Scott: But the thing is, people haven't done that with games in the past.

543
00:35:23,077 --> 00:35:23,761
Rym: They try to.

544
00:35:24,022 --> 00:35:24,947
Scott: No, they really haven't.

545
00:35:24,987 --> 00:35:29,365
Scott: No one took the risk of setting a different price point until recently on steam.

546
00:35:29,687 --> 00:35:30,289
Rym: Well, on steam.

547
00:35:30,309 --> 00:35:32,199
Rym: Yeah, there have been other experiments in that front.

548
00:35:32,219 --> 00:35:32,702
Rym: I think more.

549
00:35:33,144 --> 00:35:36,983
Scott: But no one ever took the risk on actual real deal games because it was too big a risk.

550
00:35:37,103 --> 00:35:41,484
Rym: But I don't think it's so much the risk factor, except if everyone else is charging fifty dollars.

551
00:35:41,886 --> 00:35:44,077
Rym: I know I can get away with charging fifty dollars.

552
00:35:44,419 --> 00:35:47,012
Scott: Yeah, but maybe you would make more money going forty dollars.

553
00:35:47,032 --> 00:35:47,856
Scott: Maybe get more sales.

554
00:35:48,138 --> 00:35:48,762
Scott: You know, you don't know.

555
00:35:48,782 --> 00:35:52,260
Scott: No one's going to risk trying to find out because you'll make enough with the fifty.

556
00:35:53,023 --> 00:35:55,757
Rym: But I mean, according to the article, people aren't making enough.

557
00:35:55,797 --> 00:35:56,622
Rym: And that's the problem.

558
00:35:56,783 --> 00:35:57,024
Scott: Yeah.

559
00:35:57,225 --> 00:35:57,969
Scott: Well, now they're not.

560
00:35:58,049 --> 00:35:58,532
Scott: But they were.

561
00:35:58,552 --> 00:36:07,090
Rym: I mean, it is said that of the quote, four hundred eighty six games that came out for the Wii, only sixteen sold more than a million because most of them are terrible.

562
00:36:07,251 --> 00:36:08,756
Rym: And nine of those were first party.

563
00:36:09,077 --> 00:36:09,358
Scott: Yeah.

564
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:14,884
Scott: Nintendo made more, you know, great Nintendo games like they make that punch out is going to sell a million.

565
00:36:14,924 --> 00:36:15,507
Scott: I'll tell you right now.

566
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:16,711
Scott: Guaranteed.

567
00:36:17,474 --> 00:36:17,935
Rym: I'll buy it.

568
00:36:18,136 --> 00:36:18,477
Rym: I'll buy it.

569
00:36:18,558 --> 00:36:19,039
Rym: You'll buy it.

570
00:36:19,702 --> 00:36:20,304
Scott: Not now.

571
00:36:20,565 --> 00:36:20,986
Rym: Yeah.

572
00:36:21,026 --> 00:36:23,034
Rym: The thing is, I have so many games to play.

573
00:36:23,075 --> 00:36:23,597
Rym: I don't need it.

574
00:36:23,979 --> 00:36:26,692
Rym: No game is worth me buying when it comes out anymore.

575
00:36:26,873 --> 00:36:27,134
Scott: Yeah.

576
00:36:27,194 --> 00:36:28,822
Scott: Wait, why should I get it right away?

577
00:36:28,862 --> 00:36:30,008
Scott: There's no need for right away.

578
00:36:30,209 --> 00:36:30,611
Rym: So will it?

579
00:36:30,671 --> 00:36:34,272
Rym: will it become, you know, not you can't compete with the past, but you can't compete with the bargain.

580
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:40,336
Rym: But maybe this is why so much of the industry is focusing so hard on trying to prevent for sale.

581
00:36:40,677 --> 00:36:40,878
Rym: Yeah.

582
00:36:41,219 --> 00:36:50,760
Rym: Because if if you just wait a year and buy the game in the bargain bin for five bucks, there are so many games out that if you play every game a year behind, you'll never pay anything for game.

583
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:51,504
Scott: I think it's just.

584
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:55,103
Scott: I think the next generation there's no good is not going to be physical media anymore.

585
00:36:55,143 --> 00:36:57,114
Scott: It's going to be over physical media for games.

586
00:36:57,154 --> 00:36:57,717
Scott: I think it's done.

587
00:36:57,918 --> 00:36:58,983
Scott: It's going to be all download.

588
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:06,576
Rym: I don't know what to I mean, it's good for almost every reason in the world, except for the fact that I can no longer lend my games to other people.

589
00:37:06,797 --> 00:37:07,018
Scott: Yep.

590
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:19,210
Scott: Well, I think the solution to that would be just steam should let you, you know, give you get rid of the game from your steam and put it on someone else's, you know, and if but they have no vested interest in allowing you to do that.

591
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,477
Scott: No, I think we need a law to force them to do that.

592
00:37:22,259 --> 00:37:22,861
Rym: Ha.

593
00:37:23,002 --> 00:37:26,413
Rym: A law to force the ability to transfer.

594
00:37:26,573 --> 00:37:29,383
Rym: DRM protected me to transfer digital property.

595
00:37:29,403 --> 00:37:30,246
Scott: Yeah.

596
00:37:30,366 --> 00:37:32,874
Scott: To enforce the right of first sale on digital properties.

597
00:37:34,478 --> 00:37:35,762
Rym: That would make me buy a Kindle.

598
00:37:36,965 --> 00:37:38,269
Scott: Yeah, it's not bad.

599
00:37:38,309 --> 00:37:40,579
Rym: If I could just give someone else my e-book when I was done with it.

600
00:37:40,659 --> 00:37:48,770
Scott: If you want to put copy protection on digital property, you need to still allow a mechanism for, you know, the right of first sale.

601
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:54,053
Scott: for, you know, I should be able to, you know, I mean, if there's DRM, usually it means everyone has an account.

602
00:37:54,434 --> 00:37:58,731
Scott: I should be able to delete a WiiWare game from my Wii and add it to my friends.

603
00:37:58,771 --> 00:38:05,918
Rym: We, you know, see now this is one of those situations where the market will never, ever, ever, ever, ever provide that.

604
00:38:06,139 --> 00:38:07,866
Scott: No, there's never, they'll never do that.

605
00:38:08,067 --> 00:38:11,962
Scott: It can only come out of only come from a law that demands it without regulation.

606
00:38:12,143 --> 00:38:12,886
Rym: That can't happen.

607
00:38:12,926 --> 00:38:13,087
Scott: Nope.

608
00:38:13,709 --> 00:38:14,692
Rym: So, uh, I don't know.

609
00:38:14,993 --> 00:38:19,971
Rym: I'm a strong advocate of regulation and laws to protect first sale video games.

610
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:20,935
Scott: Yeah, I'll do that.

611
00:38:21,176 --> 00:38:25,073
Rym: Even though it'll probably go one step toward destroying the video game industry.

612
00:38:25,374 --> 00:38:25,876
Scott: That's fine.

613
00:38:26,298 --> 00:38:28,347
Scott: I think there needs to be a law for sale on digital.

614
00:38:28,768 --> 00:38:38,168
Scott: I think there needs to be a, uh, destruction of the video game industry should just be a general, uh, there should be a, uh, just a, like a general law that says right of property transferral.

615
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:46,493
Scott: You know, if you, you know, pay for a good or service, you should be able to transfer that good or service to another party.

616
00:38:46,513 --> 00:38:52,255
Scott: Uh, you know, by any terms you wish, you know, just, uh, unlimited, you know, unrestricted resale.

617
00:38:52,596 --> 00:39:02,818
Scott: It's actually, if you think about it, not so much a regulation as an enforcement of deregulation, you know, it's basically saying everyone has the free market right to transfer their things to others.

618
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:10,949
Scott: You know, it's sort of, you know, protecting capitalism more, you know, saying that there is no right of free sale is the anti-capitalist way.

619
00:39:10,989 --> 00:39:17,860
Scott: It's preventing, you know, the market from doing what it wants is preventing people from, you know, it's restricting economic freedom of peoples.

620
00:39:18,362 --> 00:39:33,594
Rym: Well, I'll go one step further and say that the video game industry, I mean, if things like this happen or if this guy's right and the whole model is collapsing, I frankly kind of hope that the entire video gaming console PC market as it is completely collapsed.

621
00:39:33,655 --> 00:39:43,153
Scott: It's always great for things to be, we always see as people who love change that we are, we always want things to collapse because whenever things collapse, they're never gone forever.

622
00:39:43,173 --> 00:39:44,619
Scott: They always rise from the ashes.

623
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:49,476
Rym: Either you rise from your grave or you have 400 years of darkness.

624
00:39:50,058 --> 00:39:50,540
Scott: That's fine.

625
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:50,962
Scott: I don't think.

626
00:39:50,982 --> 00:39:54,717
Rym: if this, I want, no, I want like five minutes of darkness and the new games.

627
00:39:54,797 --> 00:39:56,986
Rym: I don't want four years of darkness.

628
00:39:57,087 --> 00:39:58,191
Scott: It'll rise from the ashes.

629
00:39:58,252 --> 00:40:04,342
Scott: People will always want video games and people, you know, people will finish the games they got and they'll be like, I was speaking more generally.

630
00:40:04,362 --> 00:40:05,931
Rym: You don't want everything to just burn down.

631
00:40:05,971 --> 00:40:13,059
Rym: I mean, I don't want, no, it will never burn down completely, but no, but like I don't want society to generally burn down around me.

632
00:40:13,139 --> 00:40:14,304
Scott: No, that's not a good idea.

633
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:17,337
Rym: I just want the video game industry to burn down around itself.

634
00:40:17,598 --> 00:40:25,614
Scott: And then already once after the Atari, it'll probably, you know, sort of, you know, they'll probably be just sort of an actual revolution in gaming.

635
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,867
Rym: But anyway, that all aside, things of the day.

636
00:40:34,887 --> 00:40:38,838
Rym: I love mashups and this is my favorite new mashup.

637
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:44,160
Rym: They mashed up the movie Amadeus, which it always surprises me how many people have never seen it.

638
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,332
Scott: It's kind of long, so it's not, it's not too surprising.

639
00:40:47,352 --> 00:40:48,376
Scott: It's not that long.

640
00:40:48,678 --> 00:40:50,867
Scott: It's, it's, it's kind of, isn't it, isn't it multiple?

641
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:56,151
Scott: I remember it being like multiple VHS tapes, so it must be like, it might be two DVDs for the movie.

642
00:40:56,171 --> 00:40:56,452
Scott: I don't know.

643
00:40:56,473 --> 00:40:58,884
Rym: I can go look it up, but regardless, it's not that long a movie.

644
00:40:59,045 --> 00:41:04,383
Rym: It's a pretty good movie and I'm just, I guess I'm surprised because I've, I was actually forced to watch it in school.

645
00:41:04,744 --> 00:41:18,107
Scott: I watched it in school multiple times and it's, I really, it's kind of like that thing in super bad.

646
00:41:19,191 --> 00:41:21,318
Rym: It's, I don't know what I can say.

647
00:41:21,378 --> 00:41:22,763
Rym: This is brilliantly done.

648
00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:24,048
Scott: Yeah.

649
00:41:24,068 --> 00:41:25,473
Scott: This is a pretty funny right here.

650
00:41:25,974 --> 00:41:28,222
Scott: It's a lot more funny if you've seen Amadeus.

651
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:30,652
Rym: It is, but it's, it's funny.

652
00:41:31,234 --> 00:41:33,704
Rym: Like you'll get the joke, you know, you're going to wonder, you know, what are they doing?

653
00:41:33,744 --> 00:41:34,267
Rym: What is this?

654
00:41:34,347 --> 00:41:35,172
Rym: And then it'll happen.

655
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:36,679
Rym: You'll be like, Oh, I get it.

656
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:48,023
Rym: Penises, but they keep, it's just the same joke, you know, kind of building and building and you've already, they've already given you the joke, but somehow it just gets funnier and funnier and funnier as you watch.

657
00:41:48,163 --> 00:41:48,404
Scott: Yeah.

658
00:41:49,426 --> 00:41:50,810
Scott: Um, so check this out, right?

659
00:41:51,792 --> 00:41:55,401
Scott: Uh, you know, I've imagined before, right?

660
00:41:55,441 --> 00:41:59,879
Scott: A game of Mario where someone else, you know, sort of controlling the level, right?

661
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,887
Scott: Sort of an adversarial platformer.

662
00:42:02,368 --> 00:42:04,496
Scott: Well, someone here, they didn't really make that.

663
00:42:04,516 --> 00:42:18,547
Scott: This is more of a programming kind of tool, you know, just an editor kind of fun thing, not so much an adversarial game, but they made super Mario brothers one, but someone else while you're playing Mario can control the game with the mouse.

664
00:42:18,587 --> 00:42:21,540
Scott: So they can like pick up a Goomba and put it under you to kill it.

665
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,012
Scott: Or they can pick up a Goomba and drop it on your head to kill you.

666
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:26,664
Scott: They can pick up the mushroom and throw it down a hole.

667
00:42:27,146 --> 00:42:35,014
Scott: You know, they can pick up a turtle shell and you watch, they, they play through in this video, worlds one, one, one, two, one, three, and one four.

668
00:42:35,034 --> 00:42:37,584
Scott: And they do some pretty interesting stuff.

669
00:42:37,986 --> 00:42:43,928
Scott: Uh, you know, especially in world one dash three with some of the moving platforms and, uh, with King Koopa.

670
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:46,837
Scott: So, uh, you should, uh, you should watch this.

671
00:42:47,218 --> 00:42:48,784
Scott: Uh, you know, you can fast forward a little bit.

672
00:42:48,804 --> 00:42:50,691
Scott: You'll get the idea, but it's, it's pretty fun.

673
00:42:52,398 --> 00:42:53,502
Rym: We need to make a game like that.

674
00:42:53,522 --> 00:42:55,912
Rym: I mean, remember north versus south.

675
00:42:55,932 --> 00:42:59,708
Rym: That was a good game that had that it had the kind of adversarial platformer.

676
00:42:59,809 --> 00:43:01,034
Rym: One person's trying to beat the level.

677
00:43:01,517 --> 00:43:02,882
Rym: One person's dropping monsters.

678
00:43:03,103 --> 00:43:03,363
Scott: Yep.

679
00:43:03,885 --> 00:43:10,445
Rym: Or in this case, southerners or northerners, depending on who's playing, always play the north because they get an advantage.

680
00:43:10,506 --> 00:43:12,953
Scott: I always played the north also.

681
00:43:14,879 --> 00:43:16,003
Rym: So what are we talking about tonight?

682
00:43:16,164 --> 00:43:20,923
Scott: Well, basically, you know, this is sort of a, it's hard to, you know, put a label on this topic.

683
00:43:20,944 --> 00:43:38,557
Scott: That's very clear, but basically I've noticed a recent trend in gaming, especially video gaming, pretty much only video gaming, where, uh, the marketing for games, you know, um, is sort of saying things about games that are not true, right?

684
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:39,500
Rym: Not just hype though.

685
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:41,871
Rym: We're not talking about regular hype.

686
00:43:41,891 --> 00:43:48,298
Scott: We're not just talking, we're not talking about things like bull shots or, you know, things that are just, you know, lying about features, right?

687
00:43:48,318 --> 00:43:55,141
Scott: We're talking about people who are coming up and bragging that their games are fundamentally different in some way.

688
00:43:55,201 --> 00:44:00,223
Scott: They're, you know, they're, they're a complete, you know, this game is a revolution in gameplay.

689
00:44:00,283 --> 00:44:04,620
Scott: It's totally different from whatever, you know, fallout three, it's a totally free world.

690
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,664
Scott: You can do anything.

691
00:44:05,764 --> 00:44:06,507
Scott: Oh my gosh.

692
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:06,728
Rym: Yes.

693
00:44:06,748 --> 00:44:12,429
Rym: You can do anything except tell the radio, a radiation immune mutant to push the button in the radioactive room.

694
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:13,011
Scott: Exactly.

695
00:44:13,533 --> 00:44:13,915
Rym: Children.

696
00:44:14,095 --> 00:44:16,342
Scott: The reality of the game is that, no, really.

697
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:19,168
Scott: It's just exactly like every other game in this genre.

698
00:44:19,208 --> 00:44:19,849
Scott: No different.

699
00:44:19,869 --> 00:44:21,535
Scott: You didn't have a revolution whatsoever.

700
00:44:21,556 --> 00:44:24,809
Scott: And in fact, you know, this game is just like all the others.

701
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:39,034
Rym: I guess what, what really makes this stand out and why it's a topic for me is that it's not just that they make these claims, it's that they kind of identify exactly what the flaws are in an existing genre, like a type of game.

702
00:44:39,415 --> 00:44:51,342
Rym: It'd be the equivalent of saying, yes, Mario one was a great game except for the fact that I can, well, there's nothing wrong with Mario one, so I can't really use that as it's not really no, but you know, taking like an MMO.

703
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:55,796
Rym: Well, MMOs are great idea, but you know, it's just a grind and it's all just parallel.

704
00:44:56,177 --> 00:45:02,197
Rym: So I say, all right, my new MMO, there's no grind and it's completely non parallel.

705
00:45:02,558 --> 00:45:06,672
Rym: Everyone's, you know, the whole world affects the whole world and that's just not true.

706
00:45:06,733 --> 00:45:07,616
Rym: It's just a wild clone.

707
00:45:07,937 --> 00:45:08,158
Scott: Yep.

708
00:45:08,981 --> 00:45:10,526
Scott: It's like you said.

709
00:45:10,566 --> 00:45:16,750
Scott: you recognize that the problem with MMOs was grind and then you came out with, you said you weren't going to do grind.

710
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:18,177
Scott: You said you were going to have an MMO.

711
00:45:18,197 --> 00:45:18,720
Scott: that's different.

712
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:22,832
Scott: And then the game you came out with was grindtastic.

713
00:45:22,852 --> 00:45:25,520
Scott: So really what, what, what the fuck?

714
00:45:26,362 --> 00:45:26,683
Scott: Really?

715
00:45:26,703 --> 00:45:35,169
Rym: I mean, it just, it amazes me that people will so accurately identify what's wrong with the genre and then just not do anything about it.

716
00:45:35,309 --> 00:45:39,289
Scott: And then say they are, well, I mean, look like, you know, there's, there's like the RTS is right.

717
00:45:39,309 --> 00:45:44,816
Scott: We'll be like, Hey, you know, the problem with RTS is that you have to click so much and it's all about who's clicking the fastest.

718
00:45:44,836 --> 00:45:45,559
Scott: that determines the winning.

719
00:45:45,579 --> 00:45:48,856
Scott: We're going to make an RTS full of strategy and tactics.

720
00:45:48,896 --> 00:45:57,473
Scott: And they use the word strategy and tactics, but I don't, you know, and if their RTS was full of strategy and tactics to be great, but I don't think they know what strategy and tactics means.

721
00:45:57,574 --> 00:45:59,781
Scott: Cause when I play their RTS, sure.

722
00:45:59,842 --> 00:46:12,027
Scott: There are these surface level differences where someone who, you know, is perhaps, you know, not really thinking about the game very hard might notice these, you know, like slight touches and think that they're clever and good.

723
00:46:12,087 --> 00:46:17,426
Scott: Like, you know, I played that, um, that, uh, Warhammer 40 K RTS Dawn of War two, right?

724
00:46:17,506 --> 00:46:18,048
Scott: Yeah.

725
00:46:18,269 --> 00:46:19,774
Scott: It's like, you can do some cool stuff.

726
00:46:19,814 --> 00:46:29,069
Scott: You can tell units to like, you know, go into positions of cover and, you know, you can have all these options of customizing units, but there's no strategy and tactics.

727
00:46:29,169 --> 00:46:31,979
Scott: It's just a really complicated rock, paper, scissors.

728
00:46:32,019 --> 00:46:40,072
Scott: You have all these options that make it seem to someone who doesn't, you know, look at the fundamentals that, yes, this is full of strategy and tactics.

729
00:46:40,092 --> 00:46:40,353
Scott: Yes.

730
00:46:40,413 --> 00:46:42,000
Scott: Look, it's not about clicking the fastest.

731
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:47,664
Scott: It's about taking cover and having the right guys in the right positions and using the right guys against the right guys.

732
00:46:48,266 --> 00:46:51,542
Scott: But that's rock, paper, scissors, using the right guy against the right guy.

733
00:46:51,844 --> 00:46:58,251
Rym: But at the same time, that's not a hundred percent fair because all games boil down to either randomness, solviveness or rock, paper, scissors.

734
00:46:58,291 --> 00:46:58,994
Scott: That's correct.

735
00:46:59,496 --> 00:47:12,878
Scott: But the thing is, is that they, you know, the, when people, I don't know if the company itself, I didn't read a lot of their marketing, so I don't know if they can be blamed, but a lot of people told me, you know, yeah, if you want to play an RTS that isn't about clicking the fastest, you should play these.

736
00:47:12,978 --> 00:47:16,433
Scott: But really there was a whole lot of clicking the fastest going on in that game.

737
00:47:16,453 --> 00:47:19,221
Scott: Um, so what's up?

738
00:47:19,902 --> 00:47:21,146
Scott: Why did, why did you say that?

739
00:47:21,386 --> 00:47:25,782
Rym: If, uh, if, if it wasn't true, I mean, it's not like this is a new phenomenon though.

740
00:47:25,802 --> 00:47:27,650
Rym: I mean, remember Dai Kitana?

741
00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:30,924
Scott: Yeah, but that game didn't really make the sort of specific claims.

742
00:47:30,944 --> 00:47:31,326
Scott: They did.

743
00:47:31,406 --> 00:47:32,371
Rym: They talked a lot about.

744
00:47:32,411 --> 00:47:34,737
Rym: this game has amazing AI.

745
00:47:35,058 --> 00:47:38,428
Rym: Like the AI in this game is going to be so great.

746
00:47:38,488 --> 00:47:42,440
Rym: Like you'll feel bad for the people you kill because they're so smart.

747
00:47:43,484 --> 00:47:43,724
Scott: Yeah.

748
00:47:43,785 --> 00:47:47,498
Scott: I mean, fear sort of people always talk about, Oh, fear has this great AI.

749
00:47:47,518 --> 00:47:48,280
Scott: Oh, all right.

750
00:47:48,863 --> 00:47:52,496
Scott: The AI in fear isn't, you know, I've played the demos of fear one and two.

751
00:47:53,098 --> 00:47:56,489
Scott: The AI in fear is not any better than the AI and any other FPS.

752
00:47:56,529 --> 00:48:01,223
Scott: It's simply that the enemies have more things that they can do.

753
00:48:01,263 --> 00:48:05,034
Scott: You know, they can jump over a railing or hide behind something.

754
00:48:05,556 --> 00:48:07,081
Scott: It's not a better AI.

755
00:48:07,101 --> 00:48:12,861
Scott: They're not any smarter than the bad guys in any other FPS, just that they have more things that they can do.

756
00:48:12,921 --> 00:48:16,192
Scott: And being able to do more things does not make you smarter.

757
00:48:16,212 --> 00:48:18,356
Scott: It just makes you appear smarter.

758
00:48:18,416 --> 00:48:19,798
Rym: But then what makes you smarter?

759
00:48:20,519 --> 00:48:33,294
Scott: If the things they choose to do in the, you know, it's the, the, the process of deciding which of those things get done.

760
00:48:33,696 --> 00:48:36,547
Rym: The problem there is that what if you just make them perfect?

761
00:48:36,587 --> 00:48:38,234
Rym: They decide the right thing to do every time.

762
00:48:38,274 --> 00:48:39,799
Rym: And as a result, they always beat you.

763
00:48:41,565 --> 00:48:42,629
Scott: So that actually good AI.

764
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:43,812
Scott: Oh my gosh.

765
00:48:44,392 --> 00:48:48,119
Rym: No, I don't think good AI necessarily necessitates that.

766
00:48:48,279 --> 00:48:50,102
Scott: I didn't say that good AI.

767
00:48:50,122 --> 00:49:04,558
Scott: The to me, that means that the AI is smart and will do the smart thing, you know, and, and, but it won't necessarily make a very good or fun game.

768
00:49:04,579 --> 00:49:17,470
Rym: So, you know, I would say the good AI is AI that is unpredictable in a, cause I mean, even when monsters, you know, bosses and games like Castlevania or whatever, or FPS is, there's always the boss and they either work in patterns.

769
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:27,323
Rym: You have to figure out the patterns and know when to dodge, or they have like a set of 15 or 20 or a different things they can do and they'll randomize them or they'll decide them.

770
00:49:27,384 --> 00:49:34,285
Rym: But it's very rare that I am caught off guard by something or that something.

771
00:49:34,365 --> 00:49:35,770
Rym: it's not just that it acts randomly.

772
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:45,734
Rym: It's that it acts in a way that I cannot either one predict what it's going to do or to recognize the randomness.

773
00:49:47,098 --> 00:49:50,007
Rym: A monster actually, they came close to that surprisingly.

774
00:49:50,047 --> 00:49:54,026
Rym: Like I was really surprised by this, but then I eventually figured out what was going on.

775
00:49:54,046 --> 00:50:00,551
Rym: But in Castlevania, there's this monster, the new Castlevania on the DS that will like, you'll see it every now and then.

776
00:50:00,571 --> 00:50:01,940
Rym: It's like, I forget exactly what it's called.

777
00:50:01,961 --> 00:50:05,737
Rym: You have to take a picture of it, but it just stands there not moving.

778
00:50:06,379 --> 00:50:08,568
Rym: And when you get close to it, it does all these things.

779
00:50:08,728 --> 00:50:12,923
Rym: And it was really unnerving to fight it because it was so static.

780
00:50:13,003 --> 00:50:20,610
Rym: And yet at the same time, so unpredictable that it took, it scared me more than anything in any game has for a long time.

781
00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:20,955
Scott: Wow.

782
00:50:20,975 --> 00:50:21,570
Scott: It's saying a lot.

783
00:50:22,191 --> 00:50:22,492
Rym: Of course.

784
00:50:22,532 --> 00:50:26,110
Rym: Then I ran into the monster four or five more times and then I figured it out.

785
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:26,752
Rym: And so much for that.

786
00:50:26,872 --> 00:50:35,278
Scott: But yeah, that's, you know, a good AI would be, you know, when you play a game like quake, you know, against human opponents, right.

787
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:37,585
Scott: There's no pattern to them.

788
00:50:37,825 --> 00:50:38,407
Rym: Yes, there is.

789
00:50:40,171 --> 00:50:49,027
Scott: Some people are, but good people, you know, they either they have like, you know, the perfect move, which is just, you know, that's what you do every time.

790
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:50,272
Scott: Cause it's the perfect thing to do.

791
00:50:50,995 --> 00:50:58,908
Scott: Or, you know, they, I mean, I don't do the same thing every time in the same situation when I play multiplayer games, you know, I mix it up, you know, sometimes I go left.

792
00:50:58,929 --> 00:50:59,471
Scott: Sometimes I go right.

793
00:50:59,491 --> 00:51:02,325
Rym: You really want to have AI that emulates what people do.

794
00:51:02,345 --> 00:51:08,338
Rym: You just have to have them bitching and moaning and swearing all the time and periodically accidentally killing themselves in the corner with the rocket launcher.

795
00:51:08,378 --> 00:51:08,881
Scott: That works.

796
00:51:08,961 --> 00:51:09,464
Scott: That works.

797
00:51:10,047 --> 00:51:14,888
Scott: But you know, if you wanted to have a really a good AI, it should be like playing multiplayer.

798
00:51:14,928 --> 00:51:16,715
Scott: No one would want to play multiplayer anymore.

799
00:51:16,776 --> 00:51:19,908
Scott: And games, they say that they've got multiplayer.

800
00:51:19,928 --> 00:51:22,418
Scott: They say they've got AI like that, but they don't.

801
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:23,724
Scott: They're just full of shit.

802
00:51:23,985 --> 00:51:25,852
Scott: Their AI is no better than anyone else's AI.

803
00:51:27,176 --> 00:51:35,804
Rym: But I guess I wonder why no one, I mean, people always say they're like, they identify the problem in the genre, but they don't actually do anything about it.

804
00:51:36,226 --> 00:51:41,808
Rym: Why doesn't someone just make a game that like, why doesn't someone make an MMO where there is no grind?

805
00:51:42,129 --> 00:51:42,390
Rym: Zero.

806
00:51:42,970 --> 00:51:43,352
Scott: Well, they did.

807
00:51:43,372 --> 00:51:44,256
Scott: It's called Puzzle Pirates.

808
00:51:45,079 --> 00:51:45,381
Rym: Yeah.

809
00:51:45,441 --> 00:51:50,382
Rym: But even then Puzzle Pirates, the way you play the game, the puzzles get kind of grindy over time.

810
00:51:50,402 --> 00:51:57,976
Rym: You're not grinding to level up, but you're still kind of grinding at these puzzles that you don't, they don't take any mental effort from you anymore to sell your shit.

811
00:51:58,076 --> 00:52:03,940
Scott: Well, I think that Puzzle Pirates, the key is the, you know, the, the puzzles of sailing and such like that.

812
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:04,482
Scott: Right.

813
00:52:05,285 --> 00:52:11,792
Scott: Like if you're just, you know, sailing, it's not really so great, but I think the multiplayer puzzles in there, you know, are pretty great.

814
00:52:12,554 --> 00:52:15,645
Scott: And also the ship combat puzzle is pretty great.

815
00:52:16,367 --> 00:52:19,458
Scott: You know, it's those direct combat puzzles and puzzle parts that are good.

816
00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:23,233
Scott: The supporting the captain of the ship puzzles are busy work.

817
00:52:23,394 --> 00:52:28,278
Scott: And you know, if you like doing that, that's cool by you, but I don't, you know, I think that those are a little bit grindy.

818
00:52:28,721 --> 00:52:28,841
Rym: Yeah.

819
00:52:28,881 --> 00:52:33,440
Rym: But well, I guess the issue was that Puzzle Pirates is popular, but it's no world of Warcraft.

820
00:52:33,641 --> 00:52:34,263
Scott: No, it's not.

821
00:52:34,524 --> 00:52:34,704
Scott: And I

822
00:52:35,367 --> 00:52:42,265
Rym: think the answer, I think what's really going on here is that for any given genre, the things that

823
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:43,047
Scott: we

824
00:52:43,208 --> 00:52:50,756
Rym: recognize as being wrong with the genre, not just we as me and Scott, or we as people who recognize these things, but the industry too, I mean, people,

825
00:52:51,157 --> 00:52:51,598
Scott: they make

826
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:57,739
Rym: a new MMO and they say, no grind in this MMO, or, you know, the grind is not so bad.

827
00:52:57,759 --> 00:53:00,310
Rym: Or they, they, they identify that the grind was a problem.

828
00:53:01,131 --> 00:53:10,480
Rym: I think what they really recognize is that players secretly want the grind, but will go to the game expect, you know, they say no grinds.

829
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:15,827
Rym: They say, yeah, the grind is bad, but they don't really recognize in themselves that they secretly like the grind.

830
00:53:15,907 --> 00:53:25,557
Scott: Well, speaking specifically on the, the issue of grind, it's pretty much obvious at this point that people, they don't like grinding, right?

831
00:53:25,617 --> 00:53:31,876
Scott: But what they do like is basically getting rewards and upgrades and power ups, right?

832
00:53:32,379 --> 00:53:35,292
Scott: And they like, you know, to just get more powerful and more powerful, more powerful.

833
00:53:35,332 --> 00:53:48,909
Scott: That's why things like desktop tower defense, or, you know, any flash game that has upgrades in it, people love that shit, but in a persistent because they also care about the rate of getting upgrades versus the other people around them.

834
00:53:49,311 --> 00:53:55,689
Scott: That's true, but that's in a, that's in a multiplayer, but in a, you know, just even in single player games, people love to constantly get upgraded.

835
00:53:55,709 --> 00:53:59,022
Scott: You know, there's this cycle of, you know, play, play, play.

836
00:53:59,062 --> 00:54:04,043
Scott: The difficulty starts to get a little hard, but then we give you an upgrade and the difficulty goes back down.

837
00:54:04,103 --> 00:54:11,190
Scott: So the game has this cycle of get starts out easy, gets harder, then gets easier again, because you got upgrades then gets harder.

838
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:13,158
Scott: Then it's easier again, because you get upgrades.

839
00:54:13,239 --> 00:54:17,376
Scott: It's this, you know, tension and relief cycle hard that you lose.

840
00:54:17,677 --> 00:54:19,442
Scott: It never gets so easy that it's boring.

841
00:54:20,145 --> 00:54:27,446
Scott: So even though you are grinding, if that cycle is balanced psychologically, it's people love that shit.

842
00:54:27,486 --> 00:54:39,150
Scott: It's like, so it's like, it's literally like psychologically addicting the way that, that if you can get that cycle just right and wow, has that cycle, like exactly dead on, they have like mastered that, you know, that

843
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:46,216
Rym: I think players will recognize that they don't like grinding, but not recognize that they like all the effects of grinding.

844
00:54:46,517 --> 00:54:50,992
Scott: Well, the thing is no one, they won't realize that they're grinding.

845
00:54:51,092 --> 00:54:56,374
Scott: And if that cycle is in balance, because they'll be getting levels so often, they're like, Oh, you don't have to grind.

846
00:54:56,394 --> 00:54:57,720
Scott: You only feel like you're grinding.

847
00:54:57,740 --> 00:55:13,215
Scott: They know they're grinding, but you don't, it doesn't feel bad unless you, it either gets so hard, unless you go a long time without getting an upgrade or it gets too hard or it's too easy and pointless and you have to do it for a million years.

848
00:55:13,556 --> 00:55:24,845
Rym: It doesn't feel like grinding, even though it is, but I've noticed that among the, you know, the so-called hardcore players they'll grind and they'll even talk about, ah, I had to cowboy, you know, I ground my way up to this.

849
00:55:24,925 --> 00:55:30,042
Rym: I ground up a new character, grind, grind, grind, but they act like they don't like it.

850
00:55:30,403 --> 00:55:33,232
Rym: And they express like, ah, it was a chore.

851
00:55:33,312 --> 00:55:41,353
Rym: I had to grind, but I feel like it's this almost affected desire to show off that did the grind.

852
00:55:41,393 --> 00:55:42,838
Rym: Like, look, I did it.

853
00:55:42,898 --> 00:55:45,466
Rym: Look at me, the grizzled, tired man.

854
00:55:45,527 --> 00:55:47,874
Rym: I stayed up all night and I achieved this.

855
00:55:48,416 --> 00:55:56,281
Scott: I think what it might be actually is sort of a, while you're doing it, you get the good feelings from, you know, the cycle of reward.

856
00:55:56,301 --> 00:55:57,605
Scott: Right.

857
00:55:58,026 --> 00:56:08,409
Scott: But I think that afterwards, you know, when you, when you look at the, you know, you're all tired and the time you spent and what you actually got out of it, there's a, there's an amount of regret that comes out.

858
00:56:08,791 --> 00:56:10,300
Rym: I don't think it's real regret though.

859
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:15,430
Rym: I think it's, or if it's real regret, it is covered up by the fact that people will say they don't like the grind.

860
00:56:15,930 --> 00:56:16,011
Scott: Yeah.

861
00:56:16,031 --> 00:56:16,615
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

862
00:56:16,655 --> 00:56:22,390
Scott: is that, you know, they, they say they don't like it, but when they're doing it, they do like it, you know, but they don't, it's a question.

863
00:56:23,292 --> 00:56:30,340
Scott: Do they actually like it or is it just, you know, the psychology of the brain tells you to like, I think with the grind, they don't like it while they're doing it.

864
00:56:30,782 --> 00:56:37,329
Rym: And afterward they, they, they like the rewards and they like all the other things about it and they like the respect.

865
00:56:37,350 --> 00:56:43,038
Scott: I mean, it seems like you get respect if you, well, it's like a mouse who doesn't like to push the button, but he likes eating the food.

866
00:56:43,098 --> 00:56:47,081
Scott: So he pushes the button and gets the food and then says, I hate pushing this button, but he keeps pushing it to get more,

867
00:56:47,101 --> 00:56:57,861
Rym: but I find it interesting that more and more, I feel like the game industry is marketing games saying that, look, here's a problem that we recognize with a genre that you also recognize.

868
00:56:58,222 --> 00:57:00,510
Rym: we are going to lie and say that we fix it.

869
00:57:00,911 --> 00:57:03,442
Rym: So then you will play the game and pretend that we fixed it.

870
00:57:04,005 --> 00:57:21,360
Scott: A similar thing that they'll do, is they'll come up with something incredibly ambitious, some incredibly futuristic science fiction idea, you know, like we're going to make a virtual world that is effectively, and they'll describe like cyberspace, you know, from like Tron or something to be like, oh, it's going to be like cyberspace for reals.

871
00:57:21,401 --> 00:57:22,425
Scott: And then what's the reality?

872
00:57:22,465 --> 00:57:23,249
Scott: Is it second life?

873
00:57:23,309 --> 00:57:24,454
Scott: It's nothing like cyberspace.

874
00:57:24,494 --> 00:57:25,216
Scott: Is that even close?

875
00:57:25,878 --> 00:57:31,598
Scott: You know, or they'll say, oh, we're going to make this like amazing role playing experience.

876
00:57:31,678 --> 00:57:32,561
Scott: And what is it?

877
00:57:32,622 --> 00:57:36,736
Scott: It's just like, you know, it's just a system that does D and D for you.

878
00:57:37,218 --> 00:57:39,707
Scott: It's not a role playing experience whatsoever.

879
00:57:39,988 --> 00:57:40,610
Scott: You were full of shit.

880
00:57:41,092 --> 00:57:44,327
Scott: Or they'll say, oh, it's going to be like this great storytelling thing.

881
00:57:44,367 --> 00:57:44,930
Scott: What is it really?

882
00:57:45,010 --> 00:57:45,753
Scott: It's a, it's an RP.

883
00:57:45,793 --> 00:57:49,145
Scott: It's a JRPG that has 10 endings.

884
00:57:49,165 --> 00:57:53,723
Scott: Oh, or, oh, we're going to make this great system of, you know, morality, you know, what is it?

885
00:57:53,903 --> 00:57:58,886
Scott: It's a one stat that either goes towards good or evil and everything in the game is black and white, you know, bioshock.

886
00:57:59,329 --> 00:57:59,590
Scott: Oh yes.

887
00:57:59,730 --> 00:58:00,634
Scott: This is a big morality thing.

888
00:58:00,674 --> 00:58:01,799
Scott: What does one decision?

889
00:58:01,899 --> 00:58:02,823
Scott: good or good or evil?

890
00:58:02,843 --> 00:58:04,591
Scott: The end good or evil.

891
00:58:04,631 --> 00:58:09,850
Scott: The end it's either murder the children or send them star Wars game, light side or dark side.

892
00:58:09,910 --> 00:58:10,814
Scott: The end, right?

893
00:58:10,834 --> 00:58:11,015
Scott: There's.

894
00:58:11,055 --> 00:58:13,927
Scott: no, it's not really real morality going on there.

895
00:58:13,987 --> 00:58:14,670
Scott: It's just good or bad.

896
00:58:14,830 --> 00:58:15,513
Scott: It's just a decision.

897
00:58:15,814 --> 00:58:16,878
Scott: Good or bad checkbox.

898
00:58:17,581 --> 00:58:21,979
Scott: But they play it up like, oh man, big time role playing big time storytelling.

899
00:58:22,019 --> 00:58:25,934
Rym: But it's, it's weird that people like I'm a play, the players recognize the problem.

900
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:27,801
Rym: The industry recognizes the problem.

901
00:58:28,283 --> 00:58:31,437
Rym: The industry will say they solved the problem when in fact they didn't.

902
00:58:31,919 --> 00:58:34,832
Rym: And the players will just agree with that, even though nothing changed.

903
00:58:35,454 --> 00:58:55,410
Scott: Well, I think that the thing there is that we, uh, have, you know, some people are just unable to like, you know, analyze games the way we analyze them in our, you know, in the way we do, you know, looking at the fundamentals, tearing away all the surface level coverups, looking at the math, looking at the game theory of the thing.

904
00:58:55,831 --> 00:59:03,718
Scott: So they don't recognize, you know, when they play an RTS and they can tell their guys to take cover and they have 10 different weapons to choose from.

905
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,043
Scott: That's just so cool.

906
00:59:05,064 --> 00:59:06,690
Scott: There's the obvious strategy.

907
00:59:06,790 --> 00:59:08,399
Scott: Look, look at, I got to choose the right weapon.

908
00:59:08,439 --> 00:59:09,123
Scott: That's oh man.

909
00:59:09,143 --> 00:59:11,676
Scott: And I can tell them to cover over here or cover over there.

910
00:59:11,696 --> 00:59:15,453
Scott: I can tell them to run, you know, and they see that as, you know, strategy.

911
00:59:15,473 --> 00:59:18,086
Scott: Whereas we realize actually all those things don't actually matter.

912
00:59:18,107 --> 00:59:19,453
Scott: Only these parts actually matter.

913
00:59:19,754 --> 00:59:20,818
Scott: All the rest is just fluff.

914
00:59:20,858 --> 00:59:27,745
Scott: So when we, by being able to see through the fluff and the stuff that doesn't matter, we re you can see that nothing has changed.

915
00:59:28,066 --> 00:59:46,100
Scott: Whereas other people who aren't able to see because they don't, you know, they haven't studied these things quite so intensely as we have, they, they believe it because, and I think actually the game, the people making games, I think that very few people in the video game industry actually study strategy and tactics and game theory or any of those sorts of things.

916
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:49,376
Scott: They don't even realize that they're, they say, our game is so strategic, right?

917
00:59:49,436 --> 00:59:49,798
Scott: It's not.

918
00:59:50,159 --> 00:59:55,447
Scott: Remember that guy at PAX, he showed you, uh, remember there was that game where you have the squad and you sort of click around.

919
00:59:55,488 --> 00:59:56,312
Scott: What was that game called?

920
00:59:56,433 --> 01:00:01,516
Rym: I forget, but it was, it was really fun until I realized that there were three colors and it was paper, rock, scissors.

921
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:03,324
Scott: I downloaded the demo on steam.

922
01:00:03,665 --> 01:00:04,750
Scott: game was rock, paper, scissors.

923
01:00:05,071 --> 01:00:05,372
Scott: That's all.

924
01:00:05,412 --> 01:00:08,043
Scott: it was is, Oh my God, there's some red bad guys.

925
01:00:08,083 --> 01:00:10,654
Scott: I better send my blue soldiers to fight them up.

926
01:00:10,694 --> 01:00:12,241
Scott: There's some, you know, green bad guys.

927
01:00:12,281 --> 01:00:13,829
Scott: I'll send my red soldiers to fight them.

928
01:00:13,849 --> 01:00:15,736
Scott: And that whole game, that's all it was.

929
01:00:16,359 --> 01:00:24,570
Scott: But you know, the guy at PAX, the guy who made the game from Australia was playing it up like it was like this big time strategic thing when it was no such thing.

930
01:00:24,810 --> 01:00:36,818
Rym: I think it's more a psychological kind of complicity into this where, so, you know, I reckon people recognize the problem, but they also at the same time don't actually want it to change, but they think they want it to change.

931
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:44,093
Rym: So all you have to do is constantly tell people that you have changed things and made a different game and they'll continue to play it even if it's the same game.

932
01:00:44,113 --> 01:00:45,399
Scott: That's very possibly.

933
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:50,963
Scott: If you just change enough surface level stuff to make it look different when it's fundamentally identical, people will believe is different.

934
01:00:52,309 --> 01:00:52,610
Rym: I don't know.

935
01:00:52,690 --> 01:01:00,927
Rym: I just, I feel like this trend is going to continue and I feel like I feel like we're seeing it more, but I can't be too sure about that because again, I could die.

936
01:01:01,028 --> 01:01:21,615
Scott: Well, yeah, but I think the, another fun, a problem here is that we can see these problems and agree upon them, but the actual solutions that, you know, to these problems, the real solutions where we wouldn't be calling bullshit on them are require such advancements in, you know, incredibly, incredibly difficult fields.

937
01:01:21,696 --> 01:01:28,078
Scott: Like, you know, we need pretty much like an actual AI, like a computer that is intelligent for reals.

938
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:33,577
Scott: You would need, you know, like a computer that could, you know, win it, go every time.

939
01:01:33,618 --> 01:01:39,982
Scott: you would need something so ludicrous to make a lot of these things happen that it's just not gonna happen.

940
01:01:40,043 --> 01:01:54,399
Scott: It's not, you know, it's not possible, or you need to make a game that would solve the problem, but it wouldn't be fun because it's, you know, psychological, you know, psychology wise, just people wouldn't enjoy playing it unless they were like us, which is barely anybody.

941
01:01:54,560 --> 01:02:02,206
Rym: I guess I just find it really interesting that we have an industry that will point out flaws and offer false solutions and that works.

942
01:02:02,707 --> 01:02:04,333
Scott: Yeah, that, that is quite interesting.

943
01:02:05,016 --> 01:02:09,737
Scott: It's sort of like, you know, and it's, it's funny because the flaws they're pointing out, it's like in their own shit, right?

944
01:02:10,238 --> 01:02:15,617
Scott: It's like saying, yeah, that RTS we made is crap, but this RTS we made fixes all that crap.

945
01:02:15,757 --> 01:02:16,379
Scott: Yeah.

946
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:18,205
Scott: Okay.

947
01:02:18,225 --> 01:02:19,770
Scott: Why did you tell me your old thing was crap?

948
01:02:20,351 --> 01:02:20,633
Rym: I don't know.

949
01:02:20,653 --> 01:02:22,766
Rym: We kind of rambled this whole episode and I'm kind of hungry.

950
01:02:22,907 --> 01:02:23,590
Scott: Yeah, I'm very hungry.

951
01:02:23,610 --> 01:02:23,891
Scott: Let's go.

952
01:02:30,403 --> 01:02:32,647
