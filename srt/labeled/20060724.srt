1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,390
Scott: It's Monday July 24th, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:12,792 --> 00:00:15,520
Scott: Tonight, we talk about the lies in consumer electronics.

3
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,437
Scott: Let's do this!

4
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:27,499
Rym: So now moments before the show, we concluded that the reason the middle class can't live in modern cities is because of the second law of thermodynamics.

5
00:00:28,521 --> 00:00:30,227
Scott: That is absolutely true.

6
00:00:30,368 --> 00:00:37,500
Scott: If the second law of thermodynamics was breakable, then middle-class people would be able to live in New York City just fine.

7
00:00:38,203 --> 00:00:45,737
Rym: Now that might sound odd, but I guess we threw that out because when we came to that conclusion, which was actually a valid conclusion, that is actually the argument we had.

8
00:00:45,777 --> 00:00:46,360
Rym: We're not kidding.

9
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:54,060
Rym: That's the kind of crap we argue about, and those are the kind of conclusions we come to, and that was a at least hour-and-a-half argument.

10
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:58,417
Scott: Well, you know, just to give everyone some clarification in case they're going,

11
00:00:58,477 --> 00:00:59,140
Scott: "Hwah-hwah-hwah?".

12
00:01:00,702 --> 00:01:09,660
Scott: We started out talking about, you know, there's some article saying, you know, middle-class people have a hard time living in cities because it's great for poor people to live in cities.

13
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:21,480
Scott: At least it's better for poor--if you're a poor person, it's better to live in a city where there's a lot of low-paying jobs and, you know, some kind of slum to live in than it is to live in a suburb where it just sucks if you're poor.

14
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,140
Rym: Yet if you're a rich person, it's also great to live in the city because there's a lot more to do with your money.

15
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:37,179
Scott: And you can live in some luxury penthouse, and there's all sorts of office buildings, and you can hobnob with all kinds of, you know, fancy people, and, you know, they're making TV shows there, and--.

16
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,960
Rym: But gentrification is slowly pushing middle-class people out of all the cities in the world.

17
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:47,360
Rym: Not just New York City, but every major city in the world in an industrialized nation is having this problem.

18
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,680
Scott: Yeah, I mean, if you're a middle-class person, you can't live in a slum or anything.

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,609
Scott: That's, you know, you make more money than that.

20
00:01:53,649 --> 00:01:55,540
Scott: Why would you live in such a degrading place?

21
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:04,940
Scott: But at the same time, you know, you want to live in the city for its conveniences, but you can't-- any place that's actually nice, you can't afford because you're not rich.

22
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:16,980
Rym: I mean, we're middle-class, and it cost us quite a bit of money to commute as far as we do, but to move that much closer to New York City would cost far more than commuting costs, even with gas prices.

23
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:17,752
Scott: Yep.

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:26,640
Scott: So, of course, the way to solve this is to, like, build a lot more places to live very rapidly, so-and-so on resources, so-and-so on thermodynamics.

25
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,022
Rym: Yep.

26
00:02:27,123 --> 00:02:30,485
Rym: We even got to the old Dubai hypothesis/theory.

27
00:02:30,545 --> 00:02:33,560
Rym: that is somewhat dubious and long-term, but it was relevant to the discussion.

28
00:02:34,463 --> 00:02:34,665
Scott: Yep.

29
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:35,979
Scott: So, there you have it.

30
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,200
Rym: We thought that was odd enough.

31
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:42,779
Scott: If you could somehow take, like, a piece of coal and get, like, a million frickin' electricities out of it.

32
00:02:44,424 --> 00:02:45,839
Scott: In no scientific terms.

33
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:56,800
Rym: Now, also, all of you who read the forums regularly saw this already, but our good friend Ido came out over the weekend, and she and I went exploring abandoned buildings at great personal risk.

34
00:02:57,242 --> 00:03:09,520
Rym: So, if you were at all interested in urban exploration or pictures of us inside of rickety old mills built at the turn of the century, or on the roofs of old brick foundries that are barely held together, there are some fantastic pictures linked to in the forum.

35
00:03:10,584 --> 00:03:10,727
Scott: Mm-hmm.

36
00:03:11,581 --> 00:03:15,133
Rym: The best part was, as we were leaving the mill, the floor started collapsing under us.

37
00:03:15,434 --> 00:03:16,157
Rym: Hey, I survived.

38
00:03:16,377 --> 00:03:17,120
Rym: I'm happy.

39
00:03:18,761 --> 00:03:25,160
Scott: You could- I survived also, and I'm also happy, sitting safe at home in my non-rickety house.

40
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:29,360
Rym: Yeah, yeah, but you didn't get to see a place where a hobo may or may not have slept.

41
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,513
Scott: I saw a picture of a place where a hobo may or may not have slept.

42
00:03:32,553 --> 00:03:33,096
Rym: True, you did.

43
00:03:33,377 --> 00:03:33,980
Scott: So, what?

44
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,624
Rym: You didn't get to- what did I lose?

45
00:03:35,705 --> 00:03:42,040
Rym: You didn't get to stick your hand into a giant old coal-fired boiler, wondering if there is any horrible animal in there that was going to maul you.

46
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,404
Scott: So, you're saying I lucked out.

47
00:03:44,645 --> 00:03:45,749
Scott: Which is- I agree.

48
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:47,334
Scott: I also- I think I lucked out.

49
00:03:47,755 --> 00:04:05,119
Rym: Anyway, also from the forums, we have had a lot of feedback as to the possible minor format changes to GeekNights that we've been mauling over, and we're not gonna really talk about it a lot today, but we're going to be subtly changing the show over the course of the week and trying different things, and we're- we've taken all of your input seriously.

50
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:14,240
Scott: Yeah, if you care about the format of this show, you should join our forum and talk it up, because if you don't say anything, we don't know what you want.

51
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:23,316
Scott: So, if you're like, "Oh, they stopped doing my favorite part of the show, or they moved something to the end, and now I don't like the show anymore," well, you know, we- we're gonna change it back.

52
00:04:23,377 --> 00:04:23,939
Scott: Just tell us.

53
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:24,678
Scott: Yep.

54
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,092
Scott: Don't run away and say, "Ah, it

55
00:04:26,112 --> 00:04:26,416
Scott: sucks.".

56
00:04:26,981 --> 00:04:34,547
Rym: The only real question I have to ask all of you right now, because this is something that is part of all the discussions we've been having, where should the things of the day go?

57
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:37,760
Rym: Do you like them where they are, or do you want them at the end of the show?

58
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,186
Rym: I'm just asking that question.

59
00:04:39,287 --> 00:04:42,060
Rym: I want your feedback before I say what I think.

60
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:46,760
Scott: Yeah, if we do it one segment at a time, then I think that we can pretty much get the format down.

61
00:04:46,881 --> 00:04:49,480
Scott: So, do you even want things of the day to stick around?

62
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:55,679
Rym: Yeah, I mean, I don't know how many of you actually click the links, because I don't look at those stats, and they're not that easy to find out at all.

63
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,480
Scott: Yeah, do you like things of the day?

64
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,748
Scott: Do you want them, or are you better off without them?

65
00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:02,720
Scott: And if we have them, where in the show should they go?

66
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:12,000
Rym: But anyway, we'll break away from that right now, and we won't even have a Geekbag today, because we have a big news, and we really don't want to do this one short.

67
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,454
Scott: Now- I'm reading, uh, what's it called?

68
00:05:16,615 --> 00:05:17,260
Scott: News Alert.

69
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:27,900
Rym: This is something we talked about at least once a while ago, when it was a rumor, and I'm pretty sure I said that I didn't think this would ever come to pass, and I gave a lot of reasons.

70
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,093
Scott: And I said, "Eh, it seems kinda reliable, though.

71
00:05:31,134 --> 00:05:32,520
Scott: It's from a kinda reliable source,

72
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:32,580
Scott: eh.".

73
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,424
Rym: See, that's what bugged me.

74
00:05:33,444 --> 00:05:37,120
Rym: It was from a reliable source, but at the same time, it seemed ludicrous and crazy.

75
00:05:37,741 --> 00:05:43,280
Scott: And the rumor just didn't die until today, when it came back from the dead.

76
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,360
Scott: Oh, holy crap.

77
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,800
Scott: And it is actually real and true.

78
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:52,480
Rym: So, AMD, the people who make all the "good" chips, though actually lately Intel has been catching up.

79
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,700
Scott: Intel has been making a lot of good chips, but the, you know, AMD, the people who make the cost-effective chips for PCs.

80
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,002
Rym: Well, let's put it this way.

81
00:06:00,303 --> 00:06:06,700
Rym: Up until about the year 2002, AMD was the undisputed champion of chips that were not overpriced.

82
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:08,746
Rym: Like, there was no question.

83
00:06:08,846 --> 00:06:12,060
Rym: Any nerd, unless they had infinite money, would buy an AMD chip.

84
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,957
Scott: No, it was pretty much until very recently, like within the past year or two, that when the newer...

85
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,915
Rym: I threw out an arbitrary year.

86
00:06:18,955 --> 00:06:19,300
Rym: What do you want?

87
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:23,760
Scott: I'd say since the Pentium M came out is when Intel has been slowly catching up.

88
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,851
Scott: Before then, Intel was definitely not up to par.

89
00:06:27,871 --> 00:06:30,420
Scott: 'Cause the Pentium 4 is just, whoa, crap.

90
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,720
Rym: Yeah, at least the Pentium M had a lot of advantages.

91
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:46,299
Scott: Yeah, well, the Pentium M wasn't really... It was lower-powered, but it's when they started getting the architecture design corrected from being the over-crazy monster that the Pentium 4 was.

92
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,029
Rym: Yep.

93
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:58,739
Scott: You know, I think I heard somewhere that the new Pentium chips, like the new fast ones, like the one we have in our Mac Mini, are more akin to Pentium 3s than Pentium 4s.

94
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,491
Scott: It's just, they figured out how to make them better.

95
00:07:01,552 --> 00:07:03,180
Scott: Some guys in Israel did it all.

96
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:15,840
Rym: But anyway, AMD, that we talked about briefly now, has bought ATI, who are pretty much right neck-and-neck with Nvidia for the video card and, to a lesser extent, the chipset markets.

97
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:20,027
Scott: Yep, and I think that, you know, there have been so many news sources covering this.

98
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:22,072
Scott: You know, they've said everything there is to say.

99
00:07:22,152 --> 00:07:25,400
Scott: Except, from our point of view, they haven't said everything there is to say.

100
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:29,369
Rym: Yes, and we have two very important points of view.

101
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:33,980
Rym: The point of view of the PC gamer and the point of view of the technologist.

102
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,679
Scott: And the point of view of the Linux guys.

103
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,202
Rym: Linux is key here.

104
00:07:37,422 --> 00:07:43,493
Rym: Now, we really don't want to cover exactly all the technical stuff because, like Scott said, that's everywhere.

105
00:07:43,553 --> 00:07:47,580
Rym: But very briefly, AMD makes processors and Intel makes processors.

106
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:55,660
Rym: They are compatible with each other in terms of the instructions they use and how they work as processors, but they're completely different architectures to a degree.

107
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,259
Scott: You need different motherboards.

108
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:05,220
Rym: Now, motherboards have a chipset, which is basically the chips that sit around the processor and control everything on the motherboard.

109
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,400
Scott: So, they're just motherboard chips, if you don't understand what we're talking about.

110
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,700
Rym: Yeah, so think about, we have people who make processors and people who make motherboards, and you need one of each to have a computer.

111
00:08:14,141 --> 00:08:15,479
Scott: Yeah, and you also need a video card.

112
00:08:15,882 --> 00:08:18,774
Rym: Now, ATI and Nvidia also made video cards.

113
00:08:18,814 --> 00:08:20,160
Rym: In fact, that was their primary business.

114
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,427
Scott: Well, they make the video card chips.

115
00:08:21,548 --> 00:08:23,700
Scott: They don't make the video- ATI actually does make the video cards.

116
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:30,699
Rym: Yeah, if you want to get specific about that, I mean, I bought a Creative Graphics Blaster Extreme that had an Intel- no, it had an Nvidia chip on it.

117
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,020
Rym: Actually, the Graphics Blaster Extreme didn't.

118
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:33,600
Scott: Really?

119
00:08:33,821 --> 00:08:34,491
Rym: I forget what it had.

120
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,080
Rym: It was something weird.

121
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:35,496
Scott: Whatever.

122
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,740
Rym: The GeForce 2 GTS had an Nvidia chip.

123
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,195
Scott: Yes.

124
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:40,905
Rym: But anyway, none of you care about that.

125
00:08:41,027 --> 00:08:43,860
Rym: Just pretend they make video cards because that makes this easier.

126
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,188
Scott: Yep.

127
00:08:45,221 --> 00:08:53,920
Rym: Now, it used to be that Intel and ATI chips seemed to go together, at least from my perspective.

128
00:08:54,260 --> 00:09:02,520
Scott: No, it was more like, um, the, uh, how can I explain this, they don't really go together in any particular way.

129
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:10,760
Rym: Well, it seemed that people who bought Intel chips tended to have ATI video cards, and the people who bought AMD chips tended to have N-Force chipsets and Nvidia cards.

130
00:09:11,181 --> 00:09:20,420
Scott: Well, I didn't really notice that so much, but, uh, the Intel tended to always be the chip where if you wanted the fastest thing in the universe, you could pay a lot of money and get it.

131
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:28,380
Scott: And ATI, you know, in terms of power of the chips, you know, seemed to actually compete pretty well with Nvidia.

132
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:36,880
Scott: It's just they didn't compete so well on the, you know, awesome drivers, compatibility, stability, and Linux support.

133
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:37,921
Rym: Yeah, well, consider this.

134
00:09:37,941 --> 00:09:39,063
Rym: There's another whole thing here.

135
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:47,533
Rym: You have the video cards, you have the chipsets, you have the CPUs, and then for the video cards and sometimes the chipsets, you have a driver, which is the software.

136
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:52,840
Rym: that's between the hardware itself and you, the user, your computer.

137
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:59,740
Rym: Now, Windows, this isn't much of an issue because they make proprietary drivers for both ATI and Nvidia chips for Windows.

138
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:13,240
Rym: For Linux, it's a whole other story because Nvidia very, very openly embraced Linux, and while they didn't give a completely open-source driver, they made it very easy to use Nvidia chips in Linux.

139
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:19,220
Rym: And in fact, the drivers that existed in Linux worked very, very well, and it's very easy to make an Nvidia chip do what you want.

140
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:22,300
Scott: Yeah, and people who are using ATI on Linux have big problems.

141
00:10:23,181 --> 00:10:26,609
Rym: Now, ATI has terrible drivers, even in Windows.

142
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:30,960
Rym: They've gotten better over the last few years, but they have a reputation for having just terrible drivers.

143
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,782
Scott: Yep, they're just, they're ass.

144
00:10:32,963 --> 00:10:42,720
Scott: It's hard to, unless you're using an ATI card for gaming on Windows, it's really hard to make it do what you want, and it can even be unpleasant in Windows.

145
00:10:43,061 --> 00:10:46,090
Rym: Think of this, the cards were pretty much technologically equal.

146
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:49,680
Rym: I mean, ATI video cards were very powerful, and so were Nvidia cards.

147
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,265
Rym: But there's a lot of that potential in.

148
00:10:52,305 --> 00:10:57,900
Rym: ATI cards was underutilized because the drivers just were so inefficient and bloated and terrible.

149
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:10,040
Scott: Right, so right now, you know, I, you know, up until today, I've been of the mind that if I'm gonna buy a computer, I'm gonna buy an AMD chip because it is the least money for the most power.

150
00:11:10,701 --> 00:11:18,380
Scott: I'm going to get an Nvidia graphics card because it works with Linux, and I'm going to get the Nvidia chipset on the motherboard.

151
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,200
Rym: Called N-Force.

152
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,760
Scott: Called N-Force because it works the best with the Nvidia graphics card, and it's also really, really good.

153
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,800
Rym: Yep, I mean, the N-Force chipset, when it first came out, when Nvidia, you know, announced this whole thing.

154
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:36,240
Scott: N-Force 1, well, when it first came out, the existing market dominators were what, VIA?

155
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:37,698
Rym: Yeah, VIA, VIA.

156
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:46,980
Scott: Yeah, whatever you want to call them, and they're still around doing their thing, but seriously, Nvidia with the N-Force 2, which is what I have on my computer right now.

157
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:54,780
Scott: Now they have the N-Force, like, 500 series or something, and the N-Force 4, and it totally blows out the VIA out of the water.

158
00:11:55,060 --> 00:12:00,520
Rym: Even in VIA's heyday, the chipsets were only good because we didn't have anything better to compare them to.

159
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:08,480
Scott: Yeah, because Intel makes their own chipsets, so you can get an Intel motherboard, you know, with an Intel chipset and an Intel CPU on it.

160
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,440
Scott: If you want an AMD CPU, you need to get the chipset from someone else, you need to get a chipset from Nvidia.

161
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:22,660
Rym: I mean, there were, before N-Force, there were a bunch of chipsets, but VIA had the most features, but at the same time, it was somewhat unstable and buggy.

162
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,660
Scott: Yeah, the N-Force is like, shit awesome.

163
00:12:26,021 --> 00:12:28,971
Rym: Even though when N-Force was announced, most people laughed at it.

164
00:12:29,232 --> 00:12:30,957
Rym: Why is Nvidia trying to make a chipset?

165
00:12:30,977 --> 00:12:31,680
Rym: This is going to be silly.

166
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:34,149
Scott: Yeah, at first I was like, what are they doing making a chipset?

167
00:12:34,169 --> 00:12:36,920
Scott: Then I was like, whoa, it works, and it made it to version 2, let me buy one.

168
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:37,394
Rym: Yep.

169
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,115
Scott: It was like, I don't think this is going to work, but if it does, it'll be awesome.

170
00:12:41,558 --> 00:12:41,940
Scott: And it was.

171
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:51,660
Rym: Now there's also the whole bit that Nvidia very much is behind OpenGL, which, think of this as a way to talk to the video card to make it do things.

172
00:12:53,181 --> 00:12:57,339
Rym: Yeah, we're trying to be really lame in here, because anyone who actually knows this stuff doesn't need us to explain it.

173
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:04,800
Rym: And ATI, instead of OpenGL, which they do support, they're very much more behind Microsoft's DirectX.

174
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,309
Scott: Well, they're not, it's not really a matter behind.

175
00:13:07,349 --> 00:13:09,740
Scott: I mean, either one of those things will work on both cards.

176
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:17,940
Scott: The point is, is that things that use OpenGL tend to perform better on Nvidia cards, and things that use DirectX tend to perform better on ATI cards.

177
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,380
Rym: Think of it this way, like, ATI will, when they make their card, they always think about the DirectX more than they think about the OpenGL.

178
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:31,720
Scott: I think it's more that they had to deal with Valve when they made Half-Life 2 to make Half-Life 2 run better on the ATI cards with DirectX.

179
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:53,240
Rym: Yeah, plus there were scandals back in the day, like, it used to be with Quake and Quake 2 and Quake 3, and there were all these sorts of scandals where, if you ran Quake.execute, the game would run a certain way, but if you renamed the executable and ran it, it would run slower, because there were hard-coded things and drivers that would make certain games perform different ways in order to cheat on benchmarks.

180
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,319
Rym: And both companies were guilty of this.

181
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:01,940
Scott: Yeah, now anyway, the point is, is that in Linux you don't have DirectX, so, again, Nvidia wins on Linux.

182
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:16,860
Scott: Now here's the thing, we like AMD chips, and we like Nvidia cards, but if AMD is buying ATI, which they are, then is Nvidia going to keep making its chipsets work with AMD CPUs?

183
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,620
Scott: That's like making products that work with your competitor's product.

184
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,040
Rym: Now Intel has already said that they're not going to be having anything to do with this.

185
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:34,400
Scott: Well, no, what Intel said is that, because right now ATI is making chipsets, motherboard chipsets, for Intel motherboards.

186
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,399
Rym: Yes, and Intel granted them a license to do this.

187
00:14:36,661 --> 00:14:39,033
Scott: You can't just do that on your own.

188
00:14:39,274 --> 00:14:40,400
Scott: Intel has to let you.

189
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,068
Rym: Now the story on DIG was a little deceptive.

190
00:14:42,088 --> 00:14:44,240
Rym: They said that Intel revoked their right to make them.

191
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,760
Rym: What Intel actually did is they chose not to renew the license.

192
00:14:49,262 --> 00:14:55,900
Scott: Yes, so AMD/ATI isn't going to be able to continue making chipsets for Intel motherboards.

193
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:01,600
Rym: But there's one more chipset that was in the works, the RD600 or something, I have no idea what the acronym is.

194
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,179
Scott: It'll get made.

195
00:15:02,582 --> 00:15:08,499
Rym: Well, the thing is, people are wondering if it is going to get made or not, because it wasn't done, and they wonder if it's even worth it to finish it.

196
00:15:09,101 --> 00:15:09,538
Scott: Oh, who knows.

197
00:15:10,001 --> 00:15:10,624
Rym: I have no idea.

198
00:15:10,645 --> 00:15:13,420
Rym: I didn't actually read much about that, but I saw a reference to it.

199
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,940
Scott: So the thing here that is being suspected is, okay, the gamers and Linux guys really like Nvidia.

200
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,308
Scott: Most people don't care.

201
00:15:21,812 --> 00:15:22,840
Scott: But we also like AMD.

202
00:15:23,341 --> 00:15:29,160
Scott: Are we going to see ATI become as good as AMD is because of the partnership?

203
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,319
Scott: Are we going to see AMD start to suck?

204
00:15:32,141 --> 00:15:34,579
Scott: Intel right now is doing a lot better than it used to.

205
00:15:35,781 --> 00:15:37,515
Scott: A few years ago I'd have been like, "Intel,

206
00:15:37,898 --> 00:15:38,019
Scott: eh.".

207
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,840
Rym: There was a point not too many years ago in which Intel was actually getting near bankruptcy.

208
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,158
Rym: They were not doing well at all.

209
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,800
Scott: They weren't near bankruptcy, but they weren't doing as well.

210
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,880
Rym: Profits were way down, their stock was dropping, they were having a lot of trouble.

211
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:57,259
Scott: They just weren't growing as fast as they did in the Pentium 1, 2, 3 days when they were the kings, and AMD was barely there.

212
00:15:57,883 --> 00:16:03,320
Rym: It didn't help that their chips cost two or three times more than equivalent AMD chips, at the height of the price gap.

213
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:10,440
Scott: But now Intel is back on track with its core 2s, and they're going to come out with the core 2-2s, duos.

214
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,220
Rym: Yeah, I guess the question for me will be price.

215
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:29,880
Rym: I mean, if Intel chips become as cheap as AMD chips, and they are super in line with Nvidia, I might switch to Intel, which is a chip that I-- I used an Intel chip on purpose until I bought the Mac Mini.

216
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,760
Scott: Yeah, well, you know, here's the thing, is like, will Nvidia even care?

217
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:50,820
Scott: I mean, Nvidia might just keep supporting, you know, the AMD line as it is, and, you know, gamers are the people buying Nvidia stuff, so will they continue to buy Nvidia AMD, even though AMD ATI will basically be the same company and do evil things together?

218
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,307
Rym: See, I really-- I wonder.

219
00:16:52,408 --> 00:16:54,340
Rym: I mean, it's really hard to say what's going to happen.

220
00:16:54,701 --> 00:16:59,500
Scott: And what people are saying now is that, you know, people are putting more and more stuff into the CPU.

221
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:06,359
Scott: You know, back in the day, you know, the math coprocessor used to be outside the CPU, now they put it in the CPU.

222
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,520
Scott: The cache used to be outside the CPU, now it's inside the CPU.

223
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:16,180
Rym: Yep, in fact, my 486, I had a 486 on it, and then I bought a math coprocessor and stuck it on the motherboard.

224
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,848
Scott: Yep, back in the day, it had two processors.

225
00:17:18,888 --> 00:17:21,920
Scott: Now you have two processors in, one processor with a dual core.

226
00:17:23,681 --> 00:17:32,048
Scott: If AMD and ATI are the same company, are they just going to put the ATI graphics processor in the CPU instead of putting it into the Northbridge?

227
00:17:32,971 --> 00:17:35,840
Scott: If that happens, then what's Nvidia going to do?

228
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:40,300
Scott: You're going to buy your chip, it's going to have a graphics processor in it already, you don't need anything else.

229
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,267
Scott: It won't need a video card.

230
00:17:43,112 --> 00:17:44,459
Scott: So, what's going to happen then?

231
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:53,420
Rym: Yeah, and if AMD and ATI chipsets and video cards are all chummy chummy, maybe AMD will force ATI's drivers to not suck?

232
00:17:54,686 --> 00:17:55,059
Scott: I don't know.

233
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,040
Rym: Will they even care?

234
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:14,160
Scott: I don't know, and then here's the other question, is like, okay, if AMD is making CPUs that have ATI graphics cards in the CPU, if Intel and Nvidia don't partner up, how are they going to compete with the old, not as fast video cards separate from the CPU business?

235
00:18:15,021 --> 00:18:24,780
Rym: Unless maybe Nvidia will just go it alone, continue marketing chipsets and video cards to everybody, thus having their own kind of side market where they're not excluding anyone.

236
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,060
Scott: Yeah, I guess.

237
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,059
Rym: But is that viable?

238
00:18:27,721 --> 00:18:29,295
Scott: I know, it's like, can you do that?

239
00:18:29,376 --> 00:18:29,780
Scott: Can you compete?

240
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:37,520
Rym: The thing is, it's my opinion that they could, simply because among geeks, the names Nvidia and Enforce carry a lot of weight.

241
00:18:37,981 --> 00:18:44,800
Scott: Yeah, people all buy, you know, the gamers especially, Nvidia is, you know, definitely has edged out ATI over the years.

242
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:50,460
Rym: Yeah, anyone who builds computers, who builds their own computers, even if they don't use an Enforce, they know about it and respect it.

243
00:18:51,543 --> 00:18:52,299
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

244
00:18:53,684 --> 00:18:56,200
Scott: I don't know, it's just, things are going to start to get crazy now.

245
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:06,640
Scott: Where, you know, a week ago, it was just a sure thing, you know a computer to buy, you buy this motherboard that's awesome from Asus or Abit, you throw an AMD chip in it and you buy an Nvidia video card.

246
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:15,840
Scott: Now, as, you know, now that this has happened, AMD and ATI becoming partners, everything is going to get crazy and we're not going to know what to do when we buy a computer.

247
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,440
Scott: We're going to see how all this craziness pans out.

248
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:23,840
Rym: Yep, because I was in the process of building a new computer, I was going to buy it within a few months and now I don't know what I'm going to do.

249
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,860
Rym: I might hold off and wait for the dust to settle.

250
00:19:26,961 --> 00:19:37,760
Scott: I would actually recommend that right before, like right now the technology is still moving forward in the same direction and none of the effects of the merger have come to be.

251
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:43,840
Rym: See, that's what I'm worried about because if I wait, then while I'm getting the new thing, it'll be the first gen of the new thing.

252
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:51,720
Scott: I would recommend you wait right before, you know, just as motherboards and CPUs and graphics processors keep developing in the same direction.

253
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:55,438
Rym: Buy the last AMD fastest chip on the best N4s?

254
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:05,760
Scott: Yeah, right before, you know, the AMD and ATI partnership, the fruits of that partnership start to appear in products on the shelves, buy the best computer you can.

255
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:14,600
Scott: That way, you know, because stuff that works now will continue to work now and the future stuff is going to take a whole long time to get sorted out.

256
00:20:15,402 --> 00:20:22,100
Scott: So right before the craziness happens, I suggest if you need a computer, you buy a good one now while everything works.

257
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:31,540
Rym: Of course, if you can hold off, you wait until slightly after the craziness and then you buy the best of the previous generation right after it is no longer the best.

258
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:40,100
Scott: Yeah, yeah, the point is I wouldn't recommend, you know, I wouldn't recommend taking part in the fruits of this merger for a long time, years.

259
00:20:40,561 --> 00:20:47,660
Rym: Well, I would say just generally because I don't trust ATI at all, but I trust AMD a lot, but I distrust ATI so much.

260
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:55,460
Rym: I really, I mean, you should have seen, we had a good ATI video card and we had a Linux box that we unhooked up to the TV.

261
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:02,438
Rym: There was no way to make that ATI card output its S-video to our television in Linux.

262
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:03,240
Rym: There was just no way.

263
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:03,983
Scott: There was no way.

264
00:21:04,024 --> 00:21:06,820
Scott: The Nvidia card, we plugged it in, we plugged in the S-video cable.

265
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,791
Scott: Immediately, the picture is on the screen without doing anything.

266
00:21:09,891 --> 00:21:12,019
Scott: The BIOS screen was on the TV.

267
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,190
Rym: It was like a Mac.

268
00:21:13,251 --> 00:21:14,000
Rym: It was just beautiful.

269
00:21:15,281 --> 00:21:17,719
Scott: Yeah, so Nvidia makes the good stuff and ATI.

270
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,000
Rym: And the sad thing is, it's not like ATI, at least as far as we can tell, does it on purpose.

271
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,685
Rym: It's not like they sit in their evil office.

272
00:21:25,407 --> 00:21:27,673
Rym: We will not let people use our things on Linux.

273
00:21:28,055 --> 00:21:29,880
Rym: They either just don't know or don't care.

274
00:21:30,241 --> 00:21:35,020
Scott: Yeah, they're pretty much, ATI is only trying to compete in one department.

275
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,608
Scott: Make faster chips that do better.

276
00:21:37,648 --> 00:21:40,940
Scott: benchmarks with games on Windows and everything else is unimportant.

277
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,502
Scott: And that's what they make.

278
00:21:43,124 --> 00:21:49,240
Scott: And as a result, it's not as well-rounded and solid a video card as Nvidia tends to be.

279
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,112
Rym: Alright, here's a funny question that no one cares about or will answer.

280
00:21:52,534 --> 00:21:53,479
Rym: What's Matrox gonna do?

281
00:21:54,805 --> 00:21:55,980
Scott: The same thing it's been doing.

282
00:21:56,221 --> 00:22:00,100
Rym: Yeah, make cards for very picky 2D people who don't care about gaming.

283
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,020
Scott: And professionals.

284
00:22:01,485 --> 00:22:01,560
Rym: Yes.

285
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,579
Scott: Yes, okay.

286
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:12,580
Rym: Things of the day, which are still in the middle of the podcast.

287
00:22:13,785 --> 00:22:15,479
Scott: Hooray, we didn't lose our things.

288
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,051
Rym: Not yet.

289
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:16,750
Scott: Haha.

290
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,039
Rym: Alright, this is something we found a while ago.

291
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,099
Scott: Oh, Rym lost his thing.

292
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,113
Rym: And we didn't use it because we kept having other things and it was so hilarious.

293
00:22:24,133 --> 00:22:25,317
Rym: We were kind of saving it.

294
00:22:25,337 --> 00:22:26,060
Rym: I'm not sure why.

295
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,720
Scott: And if you're wondering why it's science technology, well, it's science.

296
00:22:30,365 --> 00:22:30,900
Scott: It's somewhat.

297
00:22:31,324 --> 00:22:32,820
Scott: Yeah, natural selection, nature.

298
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,040
Rym: Theoretically, I should have used it tomorrow.

299
00:22:37,281 --> 00:22:38,948
Rym: But alright, this is a video.

300
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:41,820
Rym: This monkey and these two baby tigers.

301
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,850
Scott: Are they really baby tigers?

302
00:22:43,891 --> 00:22:44,960
Scott: They look like teenage tigers.

303
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,072
Rym: They're very young tigers.

304
00:22:46,092 --> 00:22:46,800
Rym: They're very small.

305
00:22:47,981 --> 00:22:50,694
Rym: Now, the tigers are big enough to be dangerous.

306
00:22:51,237 --> 00:22:51,800
Rym: This monkey.

307
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,439
Scott: Yeah, one of these tigers would maul you.

308
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,985
Rym: Yeah, the tiger could kill me.

309
00:22:55,005 --> 00:22:58,120
Rym: And the tiger is sitting there and this monkey is hanging above him in a tree.

310
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,339
Scott: The monkey could probably kill you too.

311
00:22:59,843 --> 00:23:02,680
Rym: And he leans down and he smacks one of them on the ass.

312
00:23:03,501 --> 00:23:05,920
Rym: And it goes oop and it tries to catch him and he jumps away.

313
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:12,679
Scott: Yeah, the monkey basically swings down out at the tree, hits the tiger in the ass and is back up in the tree real quick like whoop.

314
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:19,060
Rym: And then he sits up there looking at the tigers and then he swings a branch and hits him with the branch and then he jumps down and hits him again.

315
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,480
Scott: The monkey just keeps swinging down, hitting the tigers and swinging away.

316
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,159
Rym: There's like five minutes of this.

317
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:28,840
Scott: Yeah, there's one point at which the tigers try to jump up and maul the monkey but they just missed him.

318
00:23:29,303 --> 00:23:32,080
Rym: Yeah, like the monkey is hanging just out of range and then he hits him in the face.

319
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:38,100
Rym: And the best part is there's a point at which the tiger thinks it's clever and it's like hiding behind this tree nearby.

320
00:23:38,941 --> 00:23:45,699
Rym: And the monkey jumps down on the ground and looks right at where the tiger is hiding and just sits there waiting for the tiger to come out.

321
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:54,120
Scott: Monkeys and other similar to human species, smarter than beeline species.

322
00:23:54,441 --> 00:23:57,094
Rym: Yes, this video is so worth watching.

323
00:23:57,114 --> 00:23:58,319
Rym: This monkey is my hero.

324
00:23:59,882 --> 00:24:00,365
Scott: You know why?

325
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:03,340
Scott: The monkey is like braver than almost any human alive.

326
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:14,180
Scott: I mean, even like a lion, tiger, tamer guy, you know, either they're like, you know, they have tigers that are tamed and won't try to maul you.

327
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,240
Rym: Or they get mauled.

328
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,157
Scott: Or they get mauled.

329
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,144
Rym: But think of this, humans, right?

330
00:24:18,686 --> 00:24:24,800
Rym: A human will risk his life, you know, for love or liberty or land or money or women or something.

331
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:28,980
Rym: This monkey is risking his life purely for his own amusement.

332
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,699
Scott: And such a tiny bit of amusement, too.

333
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,319
Rym: I don't know, the monkey looked really happy about all this.

334
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,380
Scott: Yeah, but it's just hitting a tiger in the face.

335
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:41,571
Rym: Yeah, and then the tiger gets mad and tries to get you and you, oop, missed me.

336
00:24:42,455 --> 00:24:43,660
Rym: Jump back down him in the ass again.

337
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,619
Scott: I mean, I could play that game with Rym without risking my life.

338
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,099
Rym: That's just because I don't have a big enough mouth.

339
00:24:49,525 --> 00:24:49,838
Scott: That's right.

340
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,339
Rym: Alright, you have some sort of thing of the day.

341
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,064
Scott: Yeah, this is technology.

342
00:24:54,124 --> 00:24:58,960
Scott: It's sort of a military technology for you military fanboys out there.

343
00:24:59,020 --> 00:24:59,700
Rym: Katsu will like this one.

344
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,214
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

345
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,565
Scott: So they have this machine gun.

346
00:25:03,267 --> 00:25:05,192
Scott: Not like a submachine gun.

347
00:25:05,373 --> 00:25:07,940
Scott: Not like an M16, which is an assault rifle, I guess.

348
00:25:08,561 --> 00:25:10,140
Scott: But a machine gun.

349
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,379
Rym: Like a Para.

350
00:25:11,601 --> 00:25:15,351
Scott: A .50 caliber, mounted on a tripod on the ground.

351
00:25:15,492 --> 00:25:16,194
Scott: machine gun.

352
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:18,320
Scott: The kind you feed a chain of bullets into.

353
00:25:19,721 --> 00:25:21,770
Scott: And they have a katana.

354
00:25:22,253 --> 00:25:23,760
Scott: Like Leonardo from the Ninja Turtles.

355
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,360
Rym: A samurai sword.

356
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,519
Scott: A samurai sword, yes, exactly.

357
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,039
Rym: They mount this thing.

358
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:33,620
Scott: They have the sword, like, basically mounted pointing straight up at the sky.

359
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:40,160
Scott: So the edge, the sharp edge of the sword is pointed straight at the machine gun.

360
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:47,820
Scott: Then they fire an entire chain of bullets out of this machine gun at the sword.

361
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,619
Scott: So the bullets are heading directly at the pointy bit.

362
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:57,820
Rym: Now it's interesting enough watching it in full speed, but then they do it in ultra slow motion.

363
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:01,795
Scott: It's funny because you can hear the guy say "ultra slow motion

364
00:26:01,875 --> 00:26:02,558
Scott: camera.".

365
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:03,620
Scott: Yes.

366
00:26:03,861 --> 00:26:07,800
Scott: Yeah, and basically they start counting off each bullet.

367
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,031
Scott: They're like "Bullet number

368
00:26:09,597 --> 00:26:09,718
Scott: one!"

369
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:14,820
Scott: And you see bullet number one come up to the sword, hit the sword, and get deflected.

370
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,719
Scott: But it takes a big chunk out of the sword.

371
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,651
Scott: Then they're like "Bullet number

372
00:26:18,712 --> 00:26:18,913
Scott: two!"

373
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,600
Scott: And bullet number two comes at the sword.

374
00:26:22,061 --> 00:26:23,179
Scott: And it gets cut in half!

375
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,700
Rym: Several of the bullets get cut directly in half.

376
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,020
Scott: I think, how many bullets did it happen before the sword?

377
00:26:30,161 --> 00:26:34,980
Scott: I mean, they show you right at the beginning of the video that the sword does basically get grinded in half.

378
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,458
Scott: The sword doesn't make it.

379
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:43,380
Rym: It takes quite a few bullets, and it only breaks because eventually many of the bullets hit in the exact same spot over and over.

380
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:52,900
Scott: Yeah, if all the bullets, the machine gun is set so precisely in place that the bullets all hit pretty much near the same area on the sword.

381
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:58,620
Scott: If they were spread up more vertically and hit different parts of the sword, it might have lasted a lot longer.

382
00:26:59,322 --> 00:27:00,940
Scott: But it didn't, and the sword died.

383
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:04,720
Scott: But it was still a pretty impressive fight for the sword.

384
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:13,360
Rym: But anyway, it being Science and Technology Day, we are going to talk somewhat briefly, we'll see how long this takes, about technology lies.

385
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,580
Rym: Now you might wonder what we mean by that, because there are a lot of lies in the science and technology world.

386
00:27:18,741 --> 00:27:20,300
Scott: Oh my god, are there so many lies.

387
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,599
Rym: We're going to narrow it down to this one scenario and all of the related scenarios to it.

388
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:28,220
Scott: It's mostly lies in consumer electronics, if you think about it.

389
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:38,520
Rym: Now, you ever been to a Best Buy or Circuit City, and say you walk in and you want to buy, I don't know, a home stereo system, or a home theater, or a television, or a new computer.

390
00:27:39,601 --> 00:27:48,575
Rym: And, you know, you buy and it's got a good price, and then the salesman will always say something like, "You gotta have clean power coming into that thing, you need a good surge protector.

391
00:27:48,595 --> 00:27:49,599
Rym: I recommend

392
00:27:49,639 --> 00:27:49,820
Rym: this.".

393
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,449
Rym: And they'll hand you some $70 power strip.

394
00:27:54,661 --> 00:28:01,020
Rym: Or, to get the best video quality on your new HDTV, you need these monster optical digital cables.

395
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:01,342
Scott: Yup.

396
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:07,460
Rym: As opposed to these $5 completely identical digital optical cables.

397
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:12,340
Rym: Digital, meaning there can't be any difference at all, no matter what, because it's digital.

398
00:28:13,563 --> 00:28:13,990
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

399
00:28:14,841 --> 00:28:16,259
Rym: That's really what we want to talk about today.

400
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:19,260
Scott: Alright, so let's start with the audio file lies.

401
00:28:19,581 --> 00:28:26,880
Rym: Alright, very briefly, um, audio files, now the word technically means something different, but what the word--?

402
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:32,840
Scott: Yeah, the word audio file technically means, in dictionary-wise, someone who really likes audio.

403
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:36,171
Rym: Now, if you really like audio, do not call yourself an audio file.

404
00:28:36,211 --> 00:28:38,320
Rym: That word has become something new.

405
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,300
Scott: Yeah, just call yourself like a music lover or something.

406
00:28:40,801 --> 00:28:49,780
Rym: Audio files are people who will buy $4,000 power cables and claim they can hear the difference in the stereo they plug them into.

407
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:58,500
Scott: They will buy vacuum tube amplifiers, which are the same power as, like, a cheap-ass amplifier from the store, because they claim that, you know, it sounds better.

408
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:04,980
Rym: Well, actually, Scott, vacuum tube amplifiers do sound different, because the way-- They sound different, but do they sound better?

409
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,440
Rym: Well, they could sound better, but they don't reproduce the sound accurately.

410
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,700
Scott: But could you make an amplifier that sounds just as good as a vacuum tube amplifier without vacuum tubes?

411
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,960
Rym: Yes, you could make a digital amplifier that sounds identical to an analog amplifier.

412
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,120
Scott: And would it, um, be cheaper?

413
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,698
Rym: Uh, significantly so.

414
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:23,040
Scott: Ah, so why would you ever buy a vacuum tube amplifier?

415
00:29:23,824 --> 00:29:24,740
Rym: Uh, because you're an idiot.

416
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:26,925
Rym: Oh!

417
00:29:27,126 --> 00:29:30,116
Scott: Oh, and it-- or, there's another reason, if the year was, like, 1960 or 50-something.

418
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,022
Scott: Or '58.

419
00:29:33,727 --> 00:29:35,800
Scott: And you would also buy a vacuum tube amplifier.

420
00:29:36,161 --> 00:29:38,186
Rym: Now, let's look at TVs.

421
00:29:38,206 --> 00:29:43,120
Rym: You know, component cables that use to connect, like, your old non-HD DVD player to your nice non-HD TV.

422
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:48,060
Rym: There is the $5 component cable from, like, some random company.

423
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:54,437
Scott: Well, you know, actually, that is the thing, is that component cables, even the cheapest ones from Radio Shack, are still kinda expensive.

424
00:29:54,457 --> 00:29:55,480
Scott: They're like $10, $15.

425
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,324
Rym: Well, yeah, but you know what?

426
00:29:56,665 --> 00:29:59,637
Rym: The cheapest one is no different than the $50 Monster ones.

427
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:00,821
Scott: Exactly.

428
00:30:00,861 --> 00:30:10,680
Scott: If you go to the store, and you see two cables, you go to Radio Shack, and they have plain, normal video cable for connecting your DVD player to your television.

429
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:22,040
Scott: And then you go to Circuit City, and they have the Monster cable, which is the exact same cable, but it's all fancy and has all kinds of shielding and plastic and colors, and it's ten times as much money.

430
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,162
Scott: Guess what?

431
00:30:23,704 --> 00:30:27,580
Scott: Both of those cables are exactly identical in function.

432
00:30:28,141 --> 00:30:32,507
Rym: Yes, and even worse are when people try to pass off digital cables as different.

433
00:30:32,848 --> 00:30:35,252
Rym: A digital cable is a digital cable.

434
00:30:35,552 --> 00:30:39,298
Rym: The signal either gets all the way there, or it never gets there.

435
00:30:39,358 --> 00:30:40,760
Rym: There is no middle ground.

436
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:48,060
Scott: Yeah, on an analog cable, just so we can get this straight, you're sending an electrical wave over the wire.

437
00:30:48,461 --> 00:30:51,020
Rym: So if the cable's poorly shielded or something, you could get interference.

438
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:54,893
Scott: Yes, it is possible for there to be interference on that wire.

439
00:30:54,953 --> 00:31:00,159
Scott: You'll know if, like, your speakers are going like... Then there's probably interference going on.

440
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:05,619
Rym: However, the lie here is that the so-called better cables aren't actually any better, but anyway...

441
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:12,651
Scott: Yes, but digital cables, all they're doing is going zero, one, zero, one, one, one, zero, one, and you know what?

442
00:31:13,312 --> 00:31:16,277
Scott: Either the zeros and ones make it to the other end, or they don't.

443
00:31:16,317 --> 00:31:18,360
Scott: You can't interfere with the zeros and ones.

444
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:23,720
Rym: Because if you interfere with them, that means that there's such a powerful interference that no cable would have worked.

445
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,904
Scott: And that it'll just not work.

446
00:31:25,944 --> 00:31:28,511
Scott: You won't hear, like, your music won't get messed up.

447
00:31:28,752 --> 00:31:31,740
Scott: You just won't hear music, because the zeros and ones won't make it.

448
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:37,858
Scott: I mean, if I sent you an MP3 that's missing a few ones and zeros, you can't play it in your MP3 player.

449
00:31:37,958 --> 00:31:38,460
Scott: It won't work.

450
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:44,600
Scott: That's what happens if zeros and ones go missing, which means someone probably cut your cable with a scissor or a knife or something.

451
00:31:45,761 --> 00:31:54,080
Rym: So, despite this, whenever you go to a place like Circuit City or Best Buy, the salesmen are told, they're trained, they must try to sell you the Monster cables.

452
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,047
Rym: Now, when we say Monster, I mean the brand Monster.

453
00:31:57,067 --> 00:32:01,720
Rym: They're a brand, and they charge five or six times what they should for something that is not any better.

454
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:07,200
Scott: There are other brands that try to pull a similar scam, but they're all the same, and Monster is the worst offender.

455
00:32:07,861 --> 00:32:12,200
Rym: Yes, and power supplies, well not really power supplies, but power strips and UPSs.

456
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:29,540
Scott: Yes, if you go to Best Buy, and they have this $200 power strip, and they claim it does all these filtering things, and they even have a spot where, like, you can filter your telephone cable, and you can filter your network cable, and you can filter your audio cables, your coaxial cable television cable.

457
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,204
Scott: And, guess what?

458
00:32:31,606 --> 00:32:33,071
Scott: None of those things do shit.

459
00:32:33,553 --> 00:32:35,420
Scott: They don't do anything.

460
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:42,334
Rym: Now, there are some situations where you would need some sort of power conditioning, because power that comes into your house is not perfect.

461
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:45,020
Rym: It is not the exact number of hertz that they say it is.

462
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:51,838
Rym: It is not the exact frequencies they say it is, because our electrical system is really old, and it really doesn't matter.

463
00:32:51,898 --> 00:32:52,440
Rym: No one cares.

464
00:32:53,440 --> 00:33:04,860
Rym: And, minor fluctuation like this could affect the long-term usefulness or viability of electronic equipment, and in extreme cases could somehow affect the audio in certain devices.

465
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:20,400
Rym: However, if that is the case, an actual power conditioner would cost a quarter of what these crap fake power strips sell for, and for $30, you could buy a UPS that would rectify the power 100%.

466
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,022
Scott: Yep, let me give you an example.

467
00:33:22,243 --> 00:33:35,260
Scott: If you plug your computer's power supply directly into the wall, you know, the fact that the power isn't perfect will probably, over time, over a long period of time, eventually cause your power supply in your computer to stop functioning.

468
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,551
Rym: Because when there are sudden voltage drops, the power supply has to make up for it.

469
00:33:38,611 --> 00:33:41,040
Rym: When there's little surges, the power supply has to deal with it.

470
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:41,540
Rym: Yes,

471
00:33:42,041 --> 00:34:01,540
Scott: but if you had a UPS, which is basically a battery, in between your computer and the wall, that battery will handle it whenever the wall isn't perfect, and as far as your power supply in your computer is concerned, everything is perfect, because the battery is, you know, a nice little buffer, and everything's taken care of.

472
00:34:02,261 --> 00:34:03,444
Rym: Yes, I mean, think of it this way.

473
00:34:03,824 --> 00:34:08,755
Rym: You can buy one of these magic power strips for like $50, $60, $70, up to $200 or $300.

474
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:09,496
Rym: that doesn't do much.

475
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:11,219
Rym: It's just a fancy power surge protector.

476
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,567
Scott: I mean, it is a surge protector.

477
00:34:12,647 --> 00:34:14,639
Scott: It surge protects, you know, with the rest of them.

478
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:21,239
Rym: Or, for $30, you can buy a UPS for one computer, or one device.

479
00:34:21,666 --> 00:34:21,860
Scott: Yep.

480
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:26,260
Rym: That'll be just as good, in fact, better, because it'll also protect you if the power goes out.

481
00:34:26,561 --> 00:34:36,560
Scott: Yeah, I mean, my computer with this $30 UPS will stay on for like a few minutes if the power goes out, which gives me enough time to press shutdown, and then it'll turn off.

482
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,126
Rym: Now, you think we're just talking about audio and video.

483
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:43,600
Rym: Say you go to Best Buy, they're the worst for this, and you buy a USB printer.

484
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:55,520
Rym: Now, the USB printer is always very, very cheap, and they follow the razor blade model and get you with the ink cartridge later, but aside from that, USB printers don't come with USB cables anymore.

485
00:34:56,420 --> 00:35:02,940
Rym: And if you look, the only USB cables that Best Buy sells are either Monster brand or the equivalent.

486
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,717
Scott: Does Monster really make USB cables?

487
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:05,550
Rym: Yes, yes.

488
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:10,993
Scott: Yeah, USB cables can be--basically, USB is four wires.

489
00:35:11,354 --> 00:35:13,780
Scott: Plus, minus, electricity, and ground.

490
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:14,518
Rym: That's it.

491
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:15,161
Scott: That's it.

492
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:18,120
Scott: It's four wires all bundled up with a plug on each end.

493
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,448
Rym: So if you need USB cables, look around online.

494
00:35:20,488 --> 00:35:23,900
Rym: You can buy pretty much any lengths you want for four or five dollars a cable.

495
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:28,654
Scott: Yes, buy in bulk, because if you're a person with computers in your house, you need USB cables.

496
00:35:28,715 --> 00:35:30,520
Scott: We actually have a shortage of USB cables.

497
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:30,941
Rym: You know what?

498
00:35:31,101 --> 00:35:32,024
Rym: Not even in bulk.

499
00:35:32,264 --> 00:35:38,560
Rym: Even if you buy them online or just from local computer shops, they're cheap as hell, because you can just make them if you really want.

500
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:43,566
Scott: I know, but we can just go online right now and buy--you can buy different colors, too.

501
00:35:43,586 --> 00:35:54,700
Scott: You get four or five USB cables, the A-to-B kind or the B-to-B kind, and you'll be set forever, and it'll run you less than the cost of one or two cables at Best Buy or Circuit City.

502
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:58,248
Rym: Now, Best Buy will try to get--they'll say, "Oh, you need a USB cable for this,".

503
00:35:58,268 --> 00:36:02,900
Rym: and then they'll hand you the Monster cable, and they'll actually try to talk you out of not buying it.

504
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:05,451
Rym: They might even say things like, "It works better," or, "It's

505
00:36:05,512 --> 00:36:05,894
Rym: faster.".

506
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:07,080
Rym: They'll just lie to you outright.

507
00:36:07,441 --> 00:36:17,100
Scott: The reason for this is that they make an incredible amount of money on those cables, because they pay Monster maybe, what, like 10, 15 bucks for those things?

508
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,200
Rym: The markup is insane.

509
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,144
Scott: And then they sell them for 50 or something.

510
00:36:20,184 --> 00:36:20,865
Scott: It's crazy.

511
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:28,100
Scott: They make a lot more money by selling you a crazy, stupid power strip and a bunch of cables than they make by selling you a television.

512
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,285
Rym: You think it ends there?

513
00:36:29,306 --> 00:36:31,400
Rym: Ethernet cables are the same way.

514
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,100
Scott: Oh, God, Ethernet cables are the worst.

515
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:41,920
Rym: All right, now think about the last time you were in a computer store, and you saw, you know, like the 10-foot and the 5-foot and the 20-foot Ethernet cables, network cables, and how much they cost.

516
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:52,120
Rym: I will tell you right now that I can right now, in my house, make for you an Ethernet cable, and it would cost me about seven cents per foot.

517
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:53,879
Scott: Seven cents, people.

518
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,239
Scott: Seven cents.

519
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,437
Scott: Yet they're selling 5-foot cables at Staples for like 15 bucks.

520
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,663
Rym: Now, why are those cables better?

521
00:37:01,743 --> 00:37:02,644
Rym: The answer is no.

522
00:37:02,744 --> 00:37:14,220
Rym: In fact, in many cases, they're not as good, because they're usually Cat 5e, and actually most people who actually wire buildings use Cat 6e, because it costs the same, and it theoretically in most situations can do gigabit Ethernet.

523
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,200
Scott: Theoretically.

524
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:15,723
Rym: Yeah.

525
00:37:16,049 --> 00:37:16,618
Rym: We've done it.

526
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:17,020
Rym: Yeah.

527
00:37:17,562 --> 00:37:24,780
Scott: The point here is that if you go to Home Depot, you can buy a box of Ethernet cable for like 40 bucks, and it's like a bajillion feet.

528
00:37:25,202 --> 00:37:28,820
Rym: Or you can just buy it by the foot, and even then, it's like 10 or 11 cents a foot.

529
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:29,940
Scott: Yeah, I know.

530
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:49,580
Scott: I remember at work, we needed a whole bunch of cables, and we called up some place, and, you know, we ordered like, I think it was like 100 8-foot Ethernet cables, and, you know, sure, it was a little bit more expensive than if we had gone to Home Depot to buy a box of cable or made it ourselves, but it was way cheaper than buying them from Staples or Best Buy.

531
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,085
Scott: Way cheaper.

532
00:37:51,266 --> 00:37:53,460
Scott: Like, hundreds and hundreds of dollars cheaper.

533
00:37:54,241 --> 00:38:02,980
Rym: Now, the general moral of this, because if you don't know about the technology of whatever it is you're purchasing, it might not be easy to spot when something is a ripoff and when something isn't.

534
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:17,660
Rym: Like, when you're doing audio stuff, for example, yeah, the magic special monster cable isn't any better than the shit cable, but if you're doing something professional, you want to look at the impedance, and you want to match everything, and you've got to get certain kinds of cables sometimes.

535
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:22,160
Rym: But it depends on what you're doing, and if you don't know about the technology, there's no way you're going to find out.

536
00:38:22,921 --> 00:38:33,839
Scott: So basically, unless you're a professional working in, like, a record studio recording artists and music and all that sort of shit, or at a real radio station, buy the cheapest you can get.

537
00:38:33,899 --> 00:38:34,620
Scott: that does the job.

538
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:46,660
Rym: More importantly, if you're ever in a big box store or a chain, basically, my advice to you is, one, never listen to anything a salesperson tells you that isn't a price.

539
00:38:47,202 --> 00:38:53,140
Rym: Because they will outright lie in many situations to trick you into buying the things that make them the most money.

540
00:38:53,540 --> 00:39:03,960
Scott: Yup, I mean, there's a famous story, it's semi-famous, of this guy who went to Best Buy, and he knew this, he knew all these things that we know, and he basically wanted to buy an HDTV.

541
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:14,899
Scott: And, you know, he knew which TV he wanted, and he bargained with the Best Buy guy, and he said, "Alright, you lower the price on this TV, and I'll buy this crazy $200 power strip and all these monster

542
00:39:14,939 --> 00:39:15,300
Scott: cables.".

543
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,343
Scott: So the Best Buy guy was like, "Yes!

544
00:39:17,443 --> 00:39:18,064
Scott: Haha!

545
00:39:18,205 --> 00:39:19,066
Scott: Alright!".

546
00:39:19,086 --> 00:39:21,851
Scott: I lowered the price on the guy's TV, and he bought all these cables.

547
00:39:21,871 --> 00:39:24,396
Scott: That's great for me, as an employee of the store.

548
00:39:24,756 --> 00:39:26,880
Scott: I get a lot of, you know, brownie points for that.

549
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:29,680
Rym: Yup, or sometimes commissions or kickbacks, depends on the store.

550
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,467
Scott: Yup, so the guy buys the TV and all these cables, and he goes home.

551
00:39:33,708 --> 00:39:39,880
Scott: The next day, he comes back and returns all the cables and the power strip unopened, and he basically gets a discounted TV.

552
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:42,569
Scott: Of course, he had to fight for it, but I think he won in the end.

553
00:39:43,252 --> 00:39:44,697
Scott: The point is, is that, yeah.

554
00:39:45,179 --> 00:39:45,440
Rym: Yeah.

555
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:50,680
Rym: Yeah, they will outright lie to you, and usually, they don't even know they're lying, because they don't know anything about this stuff.

556
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:55,720
Scott: Oh god, those people who work in Best Buy, Circuit City, even Radio Shack nowadays, they don't know shit.

557
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:59,645
Rym: The thing is, they are given, like say, they sell monster cables at Best Buy.

558
00:40:00,146 --> 00:40:09,720
Rym: They are given little classes or talks on monster cables and how great they are, and these are run by Monster, or the company that makes money.

559
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,643
Scott: Yes, these people are trained salesmen.

560
00:40:11,663 --> 00:40:24,780
Scott: They don't really know anything about televisions or electronics, or maybe there's like the rare high school or college kid who's working there part-time who actually knows something, and you know, just wants to get a discount in the video games and the anime.

561
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:27,539
Rym: But even then, he'll get in trouble if he actually tells you what's up.

562
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,062
Scott: He will indeed.

563
00:40:29,122 --> 00:40:31,407
Scott: If he is caught telling you the real deal, he will get in trouble.

564
00:40:31,447 --> 00:40:37,960
Scott: And also, he has an incentive to lie to you and go with the flow, because then he makes more commissions and money and all that good stuff.

565
00:40:38,762 --> 00:40:41,420
Scott: You know, so usually those guys tend to work in the video game section.

566
00:40:43,222 --> 00:40:43,322
Rym: Yeah.

567
00:40:43,342 --> 00:40:53,980
Rym: I guess the rules are, one, never trust anything a salesperson tells you, especially when it comes to technology, and two, never buy cables from Circuit City or Best Buy.

568
00:40:54,241 --> 00:40:56,280
Scott: Or other similar stores you might have.

569
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:00,000
Rym: Buy them from a local computer store, they'll be far cheaper, or buy them online.

570
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:05,298
Scott: Radio Shack, if you get the normal cables, they're slightly overpriced, but it's better than anywhere else.

571
00:41:05,318 --> 00:41:05,720
Scott: you're gonna go.

572
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:10,293
Rym: If you live anywhere near a geek, or you live near the Geek House here, give us a call.

573
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:12,600
Rym: I'll make you any frickin' ethernet cable you want.

574
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,021
Rym: Yeah.

575
00:41:13,563 --> 00:41:18,580
Scott: Alright, now there's one more lie that we want to talk about, and that is the lie of specifications.

576
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:24,914
Rym: Now you might see, you know, someone sells a new HDTV, and they say, "Oh, it has a 8,000 to 1 contrast

577
00:41:24,934 --> 00:41:25,274
Rym: ratio.".

578
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:37,818
Scott: Or you'll go and you'll buy a new LCD monitor, and they'll say, you know, "Contrast ratio this, color saturation somethin'

579
00:41:37,959 --> 00:41:38,119
Scott: else.".

580
00:41:38,821 --> 00:41:42,417
Scott: Or you'll buy a sound card, and they'll say, "Siggle the noise ratio

581
00:41:42,497 --> 00:41:42,859
Scott: somethin'.".

582
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:52,220
Rym: The biggest problem was monitors, and at the peak of the CRT days, before LCDs were viable in any stretch, the-- Like, I think 1996, 1997.

583
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:54,700
Rym: Yeah, that era, when they would say the dot pitch.

584
00:41:55,426 --> 00:41:55,658
Rym: Oh god.

585
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,424
Rym: And they would give you the dot pitch of the monitor.

586
00:41:57,464 --> 00:42:02,477
Rym: Now, some statistics about technology are accurate representations.

587
00:42:02,497 --> 00:42:03,580
Rym: They're objective measures.

588
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:08,034
Scott: For example, I would say, "This monitor supports a maximum resolution of

589
00:42:08,054 --> 00:42:08,075
Scott: 1280x1024.".

590
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:10,452
Rym: That is objective.

591
00:42:10,493 --> 00:42:12,359
Rym: It cannot show-- At X number of hertz.

592
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,360
Rym: It cannot show more than that many pixels at that many hertz.

593
00:42:15,501 --> 00:42:16,019
Scott: At that speed.

594
00:42:16,661 --> 00:42:20,137
Rym: Or, "This monitor requires this much power to

595
00:42:20,278 --> 00:42:20,639
Rym: operate.".

596
00:42:20,981 --> 00:42:24,439
Scott: Or, "This monitor has a DVI cable hole and a VGA

597
00:42:24,499 --> 00:42:24,660
Scott: hole.".

598
00:42:25,362 --> 00:42:27,751
Rym: Now, beyond that, contrast ratio.

599
00:42:27,791 --> 00:42:30,200
Rym: We'll use that first, 'cause that's the easiest one to just throw away.

600
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:30,695
Scott: It is.

601
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:39,780
Rym: Now, theoretically, it is the ratio of the difference between the brightest color a monitor can show and the blackest color a monitor can show.

602
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:46,580
Scott: So, what you want in a contrast ratio of any display technology is a very high number and a very low number.

603
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,780
Scott: 'Cause that means that when there is black on the screen, it will be pitch black.

604
00:42:50,981 --> 00:42:53,740
Scott: And when there is white on the screen, it will be white, white, white.

605
00:42:54,242 --> 00:42:59,520
Rym: Now, a lot of companies, especially lower-end or shadier ones, will advertise all sorts of different contrast ratios.

606
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:11,800
Rym: The thing is, you have to bear in mind that with most of these non-purely objective statistics, there is absolutely no standard or regulatory control over how they advertise this.

607
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,920
Rym: And every company can measure it in any cockamamie way they want.

608
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:19,634
Scott: Yeah, so one company says, "Oh, this is how we measure contrast ratio.

609
00:43:19,875 --> 00:43:20,377
Scott: We use this

610
00:43:20,458 --> 00:43:20,759
Scott: method.".

611
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:23,575
Scott: "And then we round off to the nearest thousandth, and then

612
00:43:23,615 --> 00:43:23,816
Scott: this.".

613
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:28,058
Scott: And, you know, they give you a number like, "Oh, this thing has an 8,000 to 1 contrast

614
00:43:28,078 --> 00:43:28,420
Scott: ratio.".

615
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,935
Scott: And another company measures some other monitor, and they say, "This one has a 6,000 to

616
00:43:31,935 --> 00:43:33,120
Scott: 1.".

617
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:38,560
Scott: But the 6,000 to 1 actually looks better and has a darker black and a brighter white than the 8,000 to 1.

618
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:38,620
Rym: Yep.

619
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,588
Rym: And sometimes, they'll straight-up lie.

620
00:43:40,849 --> 00:43:42,596
Rym: They really will, especially some shady companies.

621
00:43:42,616 --> 00:43:43,640
Rym: They'll just make up numbers.

622
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:47,435
Scott: Yeah, they'll be like, "Oh yeah, this thing has a 10 hajillion to 1 contrast ratio.

623
00:43:47,475 --> 00:43:48,198
Scott: It's the best thing in the

624
00:43:48,238 --> 00:43:48,579
Scott: universe.".

625
00:43:50,049 --> 00:43:50,820
Scott: Yeah, it's better.

626
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:58,860
Scott: Also, when TVs are on the display floor, they often set the color settings to look really good on a display floor.

627
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:07,320
Scott: But those aren't the settings you use at home, so don't trust the way the screen looks in the store as to how it's going to look in your house.

628
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:07,921
Rym: Yep.

629
00:44:08,061 --> 00:44:13,360
Rym: In fact, I remember I read an article of exactly what they do to TVs in Best Buy, because someone leaked the document.

630
00:44:13,721 --> 00:44:13,981
Scott: Yeah.

631
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:25,620
Scott: What you want to do is you want to go into the Best Buy, you want to pick up the remote, and reset the TV to the settings that you're going to use at home in a normal, you know, "watching a real movie" condition.

632
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:35,600
Rym: Also, if you can, you want to put in any DVD or input other than what they're showing, because they show things that very specifically are designed to make the TVs look a lot sharper than they are.

633
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:45,740
Scott: Yeah, they show cartoons with really bright colors, they show nature things, they show concerts with bright lights and fog, you know, they show super epic Hollywood movies.

634
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:53,035
Scott: Go grab yourself like a normal DVD from the shelf, you know, of like an 80s movie or something, or an anime, and put that in there.

635
00:44:53,476 --> 00:44:55,320
Scott: And then you'll be able to tell what's going on.

636
00:44:56,202 --> 00:44:57,786
Rym: Now, dot pitch was another big one.

637
00:44:57,807 --> 00:45:02,580
Rym: It's not so much of an issue now, because with LCD monitors it's really an irrelevant statistic.

638
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:03,160
Rym: Yep.

639
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:11,035
Rym: But it's the, especially on CRTs and televisions, it is basically the distance between the pixels, or between the colors.

640
00:45:11,656 --> 00:45:13,740
Rym: Now I say "or" because that's tricky.

641
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:18,371
Rym: I mean, on CRTs you usually have three different phosphors for every pixel.

642
00:45:19,013 --> 00:45:21,780
Rym: So did they measure from the center of those three to the center of the other three?

643
00:45:22,181 --> 00:45:23,123
Rym: What if they're in a line?

644
00:45:23,343 --> 00:45:28,013
Rym: Do they measure it diagonally, up and down, horizontally, vertically, backwards?

645
00:45:28,714 --> 00:45:31,640
Rym: There are so many ways to do it that the statistic becomes meaningless.

646
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:36,400
Scott: There are lots of other different measurements for different products, not just display technologies.

647
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:38,800
Rym: Like even processors, the megahertz.

648
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:47,580
Scott: Yeah, well, megahertz is a pretty solid measurement in and of itself, but the megahertz is not directly proportional to the speed of the computer.

649
00:45:48,182 --> 00:45:54,940
Scott: I can get, if you want, I can go find a one gigahertz processor that's faster than a one and a half gigahertz processor.

650
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:00,308
Rym: See, because first we talked about statistics and data that are either useless or outright lies.

651
00:46:00,669 --> 00:46:07,960
Rym: There's also the case where there is data that is perfectly verifiable and legitimate, but people will grossly overstate or understate the significance.

652
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:17,800
Rym: Like say there's mega blobs and a fleam has eight mega blobs, but this other company's fleam has nine mega blobs.

653
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:21,128
Rym: Now, what's the difference of one mega blob?

654
00:46:21,388 --> 00:46:23,635
Rym: I mean, is one mega blob something that you'll notice?

655
00:46:23,976 --> 00:46:25,300
Rym: Is it something inconsequential?

656
00:46:25,921 --> 00:46:28,600
Scott: Is it worth the difference in price between the two products?

657
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:29,783
Rym: Is it even measurable?

658
00:46:29,943 --> 00:46:31,448
Rym: It could just be a statistical coincidence.

659
00:46:31,468 --> 00:46:35,660
Rym: I mean, a really important thing here is the idea of statistical significance.

660
00:46:36,461 --> 00:46:49,760
Rym: Not going to go over it because none of you care, but you can analyze data and based on the data and the data set and various calculus, you can figure out how reliable or accurate or useful the data you have is.

661
00:46:50,460 --> 00:47:00,299
Rym: So you'll be able to say like within a precision of 5% in either direction, we are 95% sure that this number is within 5% of this number or something like that.

662
00:47:01,261 --> 00:47:13,680
Rym: Below that, a number is not statistically significant, meaning you can't reasonably draw a conclusion based on the number because the difference in the number is so negligible that it's not differentiable from static.

663
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:19,910
Scott: Yeah, it's like this monitor has a 5 and the other monitor has a 4.9.

664
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:21,994
Scott: Well, is the 5 better than the 4.9?

665
00:47:21,994 --> 00:47:24,199
Scott: We don't know because we might have measured the 4.9 wrong.

666
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:27,006
Scott: It might actually be a 5.3.

667
00:47:27,006 --> 00:47:31,500
Scott: It could just be noise rate randomness in the measuring process.

668
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:33,002
Rym: I mean, think in first person shooters.

669
00:47:33,382 --> 00:47:38,951
Rym: I mean, the difference between 10 frames per second and 20 frames per second is insane.

670
00:47:39,451 --> 00:47:45,320
Rym: The difference between 100 frames a second and 500 is undetectable by human eyes.

671
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:46,821
Scott: Exactly.

672
00:47:46,982 --> 00:47:53,596
Scott: Even though if someone came up and told you this thing is 500 frames a second and that one's only 100, you'd be like, "Holy crap, it's five times

673
00:47:53,657 --> 00:47:53,877
Scott: better.".

674
00:47:53,917 --> 00:47:55,140
Scott: No, it's zero times better.

675
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,083
Rym: Now, with technology, the advice isn't so easy.

676
00:47:58,103 --> 00:48:06,437
Rym: Well, with technology like that, it's not as easy as, "Don't listen to the salespeople, don't buy any cables in the store," because there's really no one.

677
00:48:06,457 --> 00:48:07,338
Rym: You just have to ask a geek.

678
00:48:07,699 --> 00:48:08,560
Rym: I hate to say that, but...

679
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:16,474
Scott: Well, what you can also do is before you buy any consumer electronic product, you want to research not any specific product.

680
00:48:16,754 --> 00:48:19,860
Scott: You want to research that variety of product itself.

681
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:24,727
Scott: So if you're in the market for an HDTV, research HDTVs.

682
00:48:24,847 --> 00:48:28,012
Scott: Learn everything you can about HDTV technology.

683
00:48:28,593 --> 00:48:33,760
Scott: And don't get your information from any company that sells HDTVs, like Best Buy or Circuit City.

684
00:48:34,201 --> 00:48:40,108
Scott: Don't get your information from any company that makes HDTVs, like, I don't know, Samsung or Sony or anyone.

685
00:48:40,608 --> 00:48:49,118
Scott: Get your information from independent, geek sources that talk about the technology itself, like in Gadget or us or someone, anywhere.

686
00:48:49,399 --> 00:48:50,440
Rym: Wikipedia even.

687
00:48:50,841 --> 00:48:52,222
Rym: Keep in mind that we do this, too.

688
00:48:52,343 --> 00:49:02,597
Rym: When I bought my first, when I built my first computer, before I went to RIT, I spent over two months researching every single component and learning everything I could about them.

689
00:49:02,617 --> 00:49:04,800
Rym: I learned about all the different kinds of RAM and chipsets.

690
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:08,580
Scott: I had a one-year subscription to Computer Shopper just to learn all that stuff.

691
00:49:09,021 --> 00:49:18,533
Rym: I mean, I would read about how sound cards worked in detail, so then when I went to the store and I looked at two sound cards, I could say to myself, "Wow, this one is clearly superior.

692
00:49:18,713 --> 00:49:19,314
Rym: I will purchase

693
00:49:19,354 --> 00:49:19,414
Rym: it.".

694
00:49:19,555 --> 00:49:22,719
Rym: Or, "This one is only slightly superior but costs ten times as much.

695
00:49:22,759 --> 00:49:22,999
Rym: This is

696
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:23,420
Rym: bullshit.".

697
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:32,876
Scott: Yes, if you are less knowledgeable than the Best Buy and Circuit City employees, they are going to fool you and you're going to end up getting ripped off and buying some monster cables.

698
00:49:33,357 --> 00:49:35,020
Scott: You have to know more than they do.

699
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,241
Scott: I mean, it's sad.

700
00:49:36,382 --> 00:49:51,380
Scott: I wish, I really wish that I didn't have to know more than them because I wish that the Best Buy and Circuit City employees were experts who knew everything about technology and were honest and would share the truth and really help you find the best product at the best price.

701
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,388
Rym: The problem is that's not economically viable.

702
00:49:53,709 --> 00:49:56,380
Rym: You make much more money by selling schlock to idiots.

703
00:49:56,782 --> 00:49:58,820
Scott: And having idiots sell schlock to idiots.

704
00:49:59,240 --> 00:49:59,320
Rym: Yes.

705
00:49:59,741 --> 00:50:04,428
Scott: If there was a store where there were, like, genius geeks running the store, that would be the best store in the world.

706
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:05,810
Scott: I wouldn't have to research shit.

707
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:06,651
Scott: It would be so great.

708
00:50:06,711 --> 00:50:11,438
Scott: I would go into the store and I would say, "Genius geeks who spend your life in this store.

709
00:50:11,498 --> 00:50:11,979
Scott: You know what to

710
00:50:12,019 --> 00:50:12,300
Scott: buy.".

711
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:16,466
Rym: In fact, I remember the exact moment when I became disillusioned.

712
00:50:17,507 --> 00:50:20,151
Rym: I went to a computer store that no longer exists.

713
00:50:20,592 --> 00:50:22,454
Rym: And this was before I'd even built a computer.

714
00:50:22,474 --> 00:50:24,697
Rym: I mean, this is way back in the day.

715
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:26,400
Rym: Windows NT had just come out.

716
00:50:27,241 --> 00:50:28,765
Rym: And I go to this big computer store.

717
00:50:29,045 --> 00:50:31,892
Rym: It was like a computer store and nothing more.

718
00:50:32,272 --> 00:50:35,059
Rym: They only sold computers and computer equipment.

719
00:50:35,139 --> 00:50:35,620
Rym: It was huge.

720
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,403
Rym: And I found a salesman and I talked to him.

721
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:43,473
Rym: And I said, "I want a dual CPU machine with Windows

722
00:50:43,654 --> 00:50:44,275
Rym: NT.".

723
00:50:44,616 --> 00:50:46,780
Rym: Because I'd read about Windows NT and I wanted to try it.

724
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,905
Rym: And I had all these demands and things I wanted.

725
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:51,631
Rym: And the guy stared at me like I was an idiot.

726
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:55,360
Rym: And I don't think he even knew what I meant by dual CPU.

727
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,463
Rym: And then he said, "You don't want Windows

728
00:50:58,564 --> 00:50:58,884
Rym: NT.".

729
00:50:58,904 --> 00:51:00,867
Rym: And I said, "Why

730
00:51:00,927 --> 00:51:01,147
Rym: not?".

731
00:51:01,167 --> 00:51:03,010
Rym: And he said, "No one uses Windows NT.

732
00:51:03,531 --> 00:51:04,632
Rym: It's too hard to use.

733
00:51:04,692 --> 00:51:04,792
Rym: It's

734
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:05,353
Rym: expensive.".

735
00:51:05,413 --> 00:51:07,977
Rym: I said, "But I want Windows NT.

736
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:10,040
Rym: I know all about it and I want to run

737
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:10,100
Rym: it.".

738
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:11,605
Rym: And he said, "You don't want Windows

739
00:51:11,706 --> 00:51:11,987
Rym: NT.".

740
00:51:13,191 --> 00:51:15,580
Rym: And that was really pretty much the end of that day of shopping.

741
00:51:16,664 --> 00:51:17,439
Scott: Yes, it was.

742
00:51:18,101 --> 00:51:21,100
Rym: I mean, I wish I was exaggerating or making that up, but that's what happened.

743
00:51:23,281 --> 00:51:23,602
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

744
00:51:23,783 --> 00:51:26,250
Scott: I mean, the more expensive product is clearly superior.

745
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:26,792
Scott: Alright.

746
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:35,080
Rym: Yeah, I think we're done, but people did complain that the show cuts off abruptly, so now I'm going to ramble for a little bit.

747
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:38,360
Scott: Well, I think I just want to talk a little bit more about some of the audiophile stuff.

748
00:51:38,841 --> 00:51:40,459
Rym: Alright, we've gone on a bit long, though, so.

749
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:49,360
Scott: Alright, because at the beginning we kind of brushed it off, but there is a lot of stuff out there in audiophile technology which is just completely false.

750
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:54,689
Scott: Like, we're not even talking about, you know, they lie about the numbers or they overcharge.

751
00:51:54,729 --> 00:52:01,580
Scott: We're talking about this is a speaker that, you know, they'll say this wooden volume knob will make your stereo sound better.

752
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:02,162
Scott: We're not kidding.

753
00:52:02,624 --> 00:52:04,673
Rym: That was a very specific product.

754
00:52:04,894 --> 00:52:06,200
Rym: In fact, it had imitators.

755
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:13,860
Scott: Yeah, or they'll say these crystals, if you put these crystals or you put this sticker on the side of your speakers, it'll make it sound more natural.

756
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:18,833
Rym: I read someone's blog, and it was an audiophile, and he'd talk about it with an audiophile friend.

757
00:52:18,894 --> 00:52:21,079
Rym: It was linked to, in fact, from the JREF a while ago.

758
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:27,200
Rym: And this guy was testing sound with someone in a room with an oak table in the room and a turntable.

759
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:37,460
Rym: And, you know, they were comparing the various between this diamond-tipped needle and this other slightly different diamond-tipped needle and this power cable versus this power cable and all sorts of masturbatory bullshit.

760
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:41,603
Rym: And the worst part is that these people will lie to each other and themselves.

761
00:52:42,003 --> 00:52:50,711
Rym: They will convince themselves that they hear the difference, thus justifying their purchase, and thus they can say to other people, "Oh, of course you couldn't hear it.

762
00:52:50,871 --> 00:52:52,333
Rym: I have the golden ear.

763
00:52:52,653 --> 00:53:00,280
Rym: My ears are so attuned to the wonderful nature of music that I can hear the slightest disturbance in the sound and blah blah blah blah blah blah

764
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:00,580
Rym: blah.".

765
00:53:01,161 --> 00:53:03,324
Scott: Yes, there are people selling products.

766
00:53:03,384 --> 00:53:13,140
Scott: If anyone tries to sell you anything, and they say that it will make your music sound better, unless it's like a dollar, they're probably lying to you.

767
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:16,627
Scott: Yes, I mean-- They're probably just selling something that does nothing.

768
00:53:16,647 --> 00:53:20,799
Scott: A wooden volume knob does nothing except make your volume knob look like wood.

769
00:53:21,561 --> 00:53:23,464
Rym: I mean, there are high-end audio things.

770
00:53:23,504 --> 00:53:29,694
Rym: I mean, I could buy a $400 pair of monitor headphones that is absolutely perfect in every way.

771
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:31,757
Rym: These people will buy $4,000 ones.

772
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:36,620
Scott: That are perfect in every way, but no different.

773
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:45,280
Rym: In fact, many times, this audiophile stuff is actually worse because the people buying it can't actually tell, and you make so much more money by making it cheaply and quickly.

774
00:53:45,921 --> 00:53:50,505
Scott: Yeah, like, some guy will say, "Oh, I made this cable out of gold.

775
00:53:50,805 --> 00:54:04,919
Scott: It makes everything sound so much better, and it has a platinum core, and it's only $7,000 for this incredibly amazing cable that will allow no interference and transmit perfect analog audio from your analog amplifier to your

776
00:54:05,379 --> 00:54:05,840
Scott: speakers.".

777
00:54:06,441 --> 00:54:10,176
Scott: And some crazy audiophile will go, "Oh my god, I bought it, and I can totally hear the difference.

778
00:54:10,196 --> 00:54:10,879
Scott: This is the greatest thing

779
00:54:10,939 --> 00:54:11,080
Scott: ever.".

780
00:54:11,241 --> 00:54:13,120
Rym: Yeah, I'm so much better than everyone else who can't hear it.

781
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:15,424
Scott: When in fact, it might not even be a gold cable.

782
00:54:15,464 --> 00:54:25,420
Scott: It's probably just like a cable spray-painted with gold, and, you know, with some lead in it to make it heavy, and it doesn't make the sound any better than the cheap-ass cables from RadioShack.

783
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:36,880
Rym: That's actually one trick that a lot of low-end but marketed to the high-end audience will use, is they will put weights inside of their equipment to make it feel heavier and feel more massive and meaningful.

784
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:51,460
Scott: Yes, if you want to buy a stereo, right, and you're not sure if it's going to sound good or not, or if you're spending too much to make it sound good, all you have to do is pay attention to one, the speakers, and two, the amplifier.

785
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:59,353
Rym: The best thing to do is just run some sort of blind test where you get someone else to play the two stereos while you stand with your back turned, and see if you can hear the difference.

786
00:54:59,393 --> 00:54:59,854
Rym: And you know what?

787
00:55:00,355 --> 00:55:03,060
Rym: If you can't easily tell the difference, there's effectively no difference.

788
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:04,540
Scott: And you just buy whichever one's cheaper.

789
00:55:05,381 --> 00:55:16,340
Rym: Now, to go back to that blog, they had this big oak table in the room, and they're listening to all this stuff, and then they decided to take a lunch break, and they come back, and one of them was drinking tea, and he had spilled some tea on the oak table.

790
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:31,680
Rym: Now, they started listening to everything again to confirm their findings, and suddenly the sound was all wrong, and everything was terrible, and they couldn't figure out why everything sounded bad, and then he realized he had spilled tea on the oak table.

791
00:55:32,602 --> 00:55:33,424
Rym: I am not kidding.

792
00:55:34,125 --> 00:55:36,690
Rym: That is what they decided was ruining the sound quality.

793
00:55:37,131 --> 00:55:41,260
Rym: So they had the oak table removed from the room, and suddenly everything went back to normal.

794
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:42,521
Scott: Yeah.

795
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:45,420
Scott: So, that's called crazy people.

796
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:53,679
Rym: Now, the best part is, all of these people, if you subject them to a double blind test, wherein they don't know what stereo system they're listening to...

797
00:55:54,321 --> 00:55:56,464
Scott: So, let me explain this in more detail.

798
00:55:56,484 --> 00:55:57,625
Scott: You blindfold someone.

799
00:55:58,006 --> 00:55:59,268
Scott: You put them in a room.

800
00:55:59,628 --> 00:56:02,132
Scott: You then turn a stereo on playing song.

801
00:56:02,512 --> 00:56:05,437
Scott: You then change to the other stereo playing the same song.

802
00:56:05,777 --> 00:56:07,880
Scott: You then ask them which one sounded better.

803
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:17,040
Rym: And you do this a bunch of times, and every study has shown that not only can they not tell the difference, but oftentimes, if anything, they'll prefer the much cheaper system.

804
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:18,141
Scott: Yeah.

805
00:56:18,261 --> 00:56:27,391
Scott: I mean, there have been tests where people have compared $10,000 Bose home theaters to the $100 cheap Asian brand.

806
00:56:27,431 --> 00:56:35,020
Scott: home theater in a box, and the home theater in a box wins, even when you plug an iPod into it, as opposed to a DVD player or something.

807
00:56:35,521 --> 00:56:36,564
Rym: Now, a nice trick here.

808
00:56:36,805 --> 00:56:41,437
Rym: You might have heard the phrase, "No highs, no lows, must be

809
00:56:41,517 --> 00:56:42,139
Rym: Bose.".

810
00:56:43,242 --> 00:56:48,659
Rym: Now, while that's a little bit true in that Bose speakers tend to be very overpriced, especially for what you get...

811
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:50,464
Scott: I mean, they do sound good.

812
00:56:50,705 --> 00:56:56,860
Scott: They're not bad speakers, you know, if you're comparing them solely as speakers and not as the price and everything else.

813
00:56:57,461 --> 00:57:08,077
Rym: But, basically, anyone who's trying to give you advice about audio, and they say that phrase in a non-ironic, non-jocular way, do not take their advice, because that is like the creed.

814
00:57:08,297 --> 00:57:10,380
Rym: That's the mating signal of an audiophile.

815
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:11,317
Scott: Exactly.

816
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:12,278
Rym: Good God.

817
00:57:12,841 --> 00:57:21,358
Scott: Bose has somehow marketed itself and actually convinced people that their product is somehow sounds better than other people's stuff.

818
00:57:21,398 --> 00:57:21,738
Scott: Guess what?

819
00:57:21,819 --> 00:57:22,560
Scott: It's just speakers.

820
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:31,380
Scott: I mean, they charge for Bose speakers like 10 times as much as they charge for other speakers, and they sound good, but they're not that much better.

821
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:37,731
Scott: There's nothing special about Bose that's any better than Sony or Samsung or Pioneer or anyone else.

822
00:57:38,171 --> 00:57:38,973
Scott: They're just speakers.

823
00:57:39,554 --> 00:57:43,240
Scott: They're just good speakers, but they're not super amazing worth of fortune.

824
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:46,380
Rym: And on that note, Scott, I'm cutting you off, because now we have gone long.

825
00:57:46,605 --> 00:57:46,797
Rym: Okay.

826
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:48,362
Rym: And I think the episode was long enough.

827
00:57:48,743 --> 00:57:53,570
Rym: Once again, give us feedback as to how you want the show to change, if you want to change it at all.

828
00:57:54,071 --> 00:58:00,440
Rym: We're not going to talk about our changes, we're just going to start making them, so let us know if anything works particularly well or you don't like it or whatever.

829
00:58:01,033 --> 00:58:01,380
Scott: All right.

830
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:10,989
Rym: And that was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

831
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:13,580
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for our opening theme.

832
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:18,470
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at www.frontrowcrew.com.

833
00:58:19,112 --> 00:58:21,578
Scott: If you like our podcasts, you'll love our forums.

834
00:58:21,658 --> 00:58:22,360
Scott: Make sure you visit them.

835
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:29,032
Scott: You can send your email feedback to geeknights@gmail.com, and if you want, you can leave us a voicemail at 206-333-1537.

836
00:58:33,743 --> 00:58:36,500
Rym: GeekNights airs every weeknight, Monday through Thursday.

837
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,429
Scott: GeekNights is recorded with absolutely no studio and no audience.

838
00:58:41,131 --> 00:58:44,280
Scott: But unlike those other talk shows, it's actually recorded at night.
