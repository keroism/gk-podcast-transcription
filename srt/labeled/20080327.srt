1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,788
Rym: It's Thursday, March 27th.

2
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:12,612
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,752 --> 00:00:14,860
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:15,161 --> 00:00:20,118
Rym: We tried we wanted to talk about Monty Python, but other things came up.

5
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:35,469
Rym: Let's do this so normally I'd avoid talking about politics whenever Scott is here because he never seems to care.

6
00:00:35,549 --> 00:00:48,057
Rym: but This story needs to be talked about a little bit Partly because it is my opinion that this marks the pretty much the end of Hillary Clinton's viability as a Democratic candidate for president this time around.

7
00:00:48,137 --> 00:00:51,450
Scott: I don't know if it's not something that's gonna be in a history book 50 years from now.

8
00:00:52,036 --> 00:00:53,210
Scott: I don't think it's worth talking about.

9
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,539
Rym: Okay, a lot of this is gonna be in history books much like.

10
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,345
Rym: I mean do we defeats Truman?

11
00:00:58,807 --> 00:00:59,830
Scott: Yeah, that's yes.

12
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,765
Scott: So that's the only thing that's in the history book though.

13
00:01:01,806 --> 00:01:03,796
Scott: three words Not these details and such.

14
00:01:04,016 --> 00:01:07,430
Rym: only if you went to a crappy school and had crappy history books.

15
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:08,314
Scott: I mean think about it.

16
00:01:08,374 --> 00:01:08,575
Scott: right.

17
00:01:08,776 --> 00:01:10,744
Scott: teapot dome like one paragraph.

18
00:01:10,764 --> 00:01:12,030
Scott: my history book one paragraph.

19
00:01:12,152 --> 00:01:13,489
Rym: We had like a whole unit on that thing.

20
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:14,313
Scott: Yeah, like what fair.

21
00:01:14,354 --> 00:01:16,403
Rym: and then we had a whole separate unit on economics.

22
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:17,970
Rym: and why teapot dome mattered?

23
00:01:18,172 --> 00:01:20,249
Scott: Yeah, is this teapot dome level?

24
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,498
Rym: This is in current events.

25
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:30,770
Rym: This is I'm convinced that what happened here has Basically told us that Obama is going to be the Democratic nominee.

26
00:01:31,192 --> 00:01:33,121
Rym: I think that this absolutely clinches it.

27
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:36,744
Rym: you have to read between the lines a little bit The story here.

28
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:39,750
Scott: basically It's Rym likes to grasp at straws.

29
00:01:40,612 --> 00:01:41,176
Rym: Not really.

30
00:01:41,196 --> 00:01:42,143
Rym: This is pretty.

31
00:01:42,163 --> 00:01:43,009
Rym: you'll see what I mean.

32
00:01:43,771 --> 00:02:00,462
Rym: So Hillary Clinton as you know is behind in the popular vote and she's behind in terms of pledged delegates and she's behind Total in terms of all delegates even if you include the super delegates who split more for her than for Obama Despite the fact that he has actually gained several super delegates recently.

33
00:02:00,864 --> 00:02:11,278
Rym: He gained one most notably when spitzer Had to step down due to various things loops, but Clinton has had a lot of trouble lately.

34
00:02:11,338 --> 00:02:12,623
Rym: I mean a little while ago.

35
00:02:12,723 --> 00:02:24,169
Rym: She was caught fiving about Landing in Bosnia under sniper fire and then it turned out that there was actually news video of her landing and it completely Contradicted her entire story.

36
00:02:24,846 --> 00:02:32,621
Scott: Yeah How come when like the people who are in charge like that happens to them on a daily show like every other day and no One makes a big deal about it.

37
00:02:32,641 --> 00:02:38,049
Rym: Uh No one makes a big deal about anything because no one knows anything or cares or even understand what's going on.

38
00:02:38,311 --> 00:02:40,463
Rym: Yeah, I care about this a little now.

39
00:02:40,825 --> 00:02:41,750
Rym: I posted this in the forums.

40
00:02:41,851 --> 00:02:44,610
Rym: I got to say the fact that Hillary lied about this and got caught.

41
00:02:45,512 --> 00:02:51,790
Rym: I don't think it says anything about her character because her fib Was pretty much par for the course when it comes to American politics.

42
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,856
Rym: Like I don't even worry about that.

43
00:02:53,877 --> 00:02:58,070
Rym: the fact that she exaggerated a bit and fibbed a bit doesn't even register for me.

44
00:02:58,592 --> 00:03:01,406
Rym: I would never consider saying well, that's it for Hillary.

45
00:03:01,466 --> 00:03:02,330
Rym: She lied.

46
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:03,836
Scott: I mean the.

47
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:07,690
Scott: I said this in the forum, but basically the political climate in the u.s.

48
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,935
Scott: Nobody's a perfect human being.

49
00:03:09,995 --> 00:03:14,710
Scott: nobody everyone has something, you know that they did wrong except Barack Obama.

50
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:19,127
Scott: Yeah, I'm sure or a mistake they made at some point or you know something right?

51
00:03:19,147 --> 00:03:19,609
Rym: What about FDR?

52
00:03:21,615 --> 00:03:22,386
Scott: He couldn't walk.

53
00:03:25,678 --> 00:03:26,620
Rym: I don't think that was his.

54
00:03:29,247 --> 00:03:33,170
Scott: Okay That was anyway, he's got too soon.

55
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,255
Scott: No, that was me.

56
00:03:34,516 --> 00:03:35,219
Scott: Yeah, right to see.

57
00:03:35,279 --> 00:03:37,326
Scott: now That was me leading into.

58
00:03:38,048 --> 00:03:39,713
Scott: oh, so it wasn't his fault that he couldn't walk.

59
00:03:40,174 --> 00:03:40,937
Scott: So it wasn't my fault.

60
00:03:40,977 --> 00:03:42,000
Scott: You bastards got sick.

61
00:03:42,203 --> 00:03:43,139
Scott: Okay, end of story.

62
00:03:44,264 --> 00:03:47,586
Rym: Yeah, except you were the one who went out In the first place.

63
00:03:47,626 --> 00:03:49,114
Scott: Oh FDR went out and got polio.

64
00:03:49,134 --> 00:03:58,036
Rym: Is that we're saying no You see the thing is I don't think FDR spent the the previous many years of his life going around telling people how immune to polio he is.

65
00:03:59,163 --> 00:04:00,438
Rym: I don't think that's what he was doing.

66
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:09,320
Rym: Wow, you can tell it's Thursday, we're done All right.

67
00:04:09,922 --> 00:04:21,269
Scott: So the way the way the media works in the US if you're a politician, especially one running for office Especially one running for federal office, especially one running for president Especially one would have a good chance of winning at president.

68
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:24,580
Scott: winning at president like it's a game the president game.

69
00:04:24,822 --> 00:04:25,549
Scott: I want to win at it.

70
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:25,852
Scott: Yes.

71
00:04:25,872 --> 00:04:26,074
Scott: Okay.

72
00:04:26,236 --> 00:04:28,045
Scott: Um You pretty much.

73
00:04:28,085 --> 00:04:34,751
Scott: you either have to be perfect as a human being your entire life from when you were born Or you have to lie and not get caught

74
00:04:35,092 --> 00:04:35,795
Rym: because sadly which

75
00:04:35,855 --> 00:04:45,280
Scott: are both pretty much impossible things to do in the current world when everyone is looking at you all the time and Going over every word you say making sure you didn't lie.

76
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:51,822
Rym: But at the same time that I like the environment is creating because it's gonna get to the point where people can't hide what they've Done anymore.

77
00:04:52,365 --> 00:05:05,398
Rym: and once people realize that and the new governor of New York State Actually is kind of on the forefront of this because after all the scandal he stepped up and pretty much immediately It came out that he had an affair in the past and his response was yep

78
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:06,841
Scott: Yeah,

79
00:05:07,102 --> 00:05:14,943
Rym: and it's that whenever anyone accuses you of something a bit embarrassing whatever as long as you're not gonna go to Jail over it.

80
00:05:14,983 --> 00:05:20,329
Rym: I'm not gonna get into you know, well don't confess to crimes because if you committed a crime that was bad You probably should confess.

81
00:05:20,349 --> 00:05:33,240
Rym: But anyway, well fifth amendment, you know, you know, but I'm just saying if Someone is like I heard you were an anime if I got to think of something horrible that isn't horrible enough to warrant jail.

82
00:05:33,964 --> 00:05:36,600
Scott: You watch the worst hentai all the time.

83
00:05:36,761 --> 00:05:45,459
Rym: I heard that you were into Harry Potter doji and cheese where everybody's gay Totally having sex and if you're a person like that would get a lot of votes.

84
00:05:46,364 --> 00:05:52,995
Rym: But if your response to that is yep, you want to see some That takes all that talk about taking the thunder out of someone's argument.

85
00:05:53,015 --> 00:05:57,119
Scott: It's like, uh, no Well, it takes them out of one argument and brings it to another one.

86
00:05:57,562 --> 00:06:00,096
Scott: And basically what you're doing there is you're avoiding the.

87
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:04,252
Scott: you know you're bad because you're lying battle and instead you have.

88
00:06:04,272 --> 00:06:13,999
Scott: you're deciding that you're going to have the Gay Harry Potter doujin is good battle And if you don't think you can win that battle You should probably lie and try to get away with it.

89
00:06:14,221 --> 00:06:20,817
Scott: But if you can win the second battle though Then by all means you should always cuz like the governor the new governor.

90
00:06:21,118 --> 00:06:21,680
Scott: he came out.

91
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,530
Scott: They said you had an affair and he said yup and he cuz.

92
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,594
Scott: he knew he could win the.

93
00:06:25,955 --> 00:06:27,360
Scott: plenty of people have affairs.

94
00:06:27,641 --> 00:06:28,465
Scott: We sorted it out.

95
00:06:28,505 --> 00:06:30,915
Scott: We're better than most people in those terms.

96
00:06:31,116 --> 00:06:32,020
Scott: He could win that battle.

97
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,029
Scott: So he decided to go fight it, but he couldn't win the.

98
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:35,094
Rym: I didn't have an affair cuz.

99
00:06:35,114 --> 00:06:36,320
Rym: that's when the YouTube videos come.

100
00:06:36,706 --> 00:06:47,546
Rym: yeah, but What Hillary did is she lied about something that was minor but yet was trivially trivially proven wrong.

101
00:06:48,168 --> 00:06:55,900
Rym: and the fact that Obama has not made a similar misstep and Just the nature of exactly what Hillary lied about it doesn't say that she's a liar.

102
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:01,480
Rym: All politicians are liars except like crazy beings except except crazy politicians.

103
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:07,033
Rym: They often don't lie, but they're crazy So it's not okay, so I guess that's me.

104
00:07:07,073 --> 00:07:14,807
Rym: I don't lie, but I'm crazy Like Mike Gravelle and Ron Paul, they don't pretend like well, I'm for this one really there for this They're really for this.

105
00:07:15,149 --> 00:07:16,919
Rym: This is just crazy and stupid.

106
00:07:17,702 --> 00:07:23,940
Scott: Well, Mike Gravelle is only he's great except for like one one you who won it one or two issues.

107
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,304
Scott: He's just stupidly crazy.

108
00:07:25,324 --> 00:07:26,747
Scott: So crazy that he's unvoteable.

109
00:07:27,148 --> 00:07:32,640
Rym: Yeah, I Got news about him, but I'll say imagine if someone agreed with you on everything.

110
00:07:33,062 --> 00:07:36,495
Scott: But they also thought that the earth was a cube a hollow cube.

111
00:07:36,555 --> 00:07:37,880
Rym: Yeah, not even like a flat.

112
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:41,952
Rym: We're talking like a cube that's rotating on the top of a turtle.

113
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:42,814
Rym: That's purple.

114
00:07:43,235 --> 00:07:49,679
Scott: Yeah, it's like whoa, dude All right, you agree about everything else, but now I can't respect you or vote for you or anything.

115
00:07:50,302 --> 00:07:51,346
Rym: But does your earth cube?

116
00:07:51,728 --> 00:07:54,559
Rym: the fact that Hillary fibbed about something like this?

117
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,211
Rym: Speaks to the fact that she doesn't get the modern world.

118
00:07:58,271 --> 00:08:03,808
Rym: She is definitely an artifact of old world politics And Obama whatever you feel about it.

119
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:06,920
Rym: He has not made any modern misstep.

120
00:08:07,442 --> 00:08:12,020
Rym: He has made missteps in the classic political sense, but he has not made a modern mistake.

121
00:08:12,281 --> 00:08:12,502
Rym: He is.

122
00:08:12,763 --> 00:08:16,280
Rym: he has not run afoul of issues that are new in politics.

123
00:08:16,742 --> 00:08:24,179
Scott: I really the one thing I got to say that I do kind of care about politics now Right is it's gonna be super interesting.

124
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:29,984
Scott: Let's say let's pretend Obama wins and he's the president and you know, so it's it's February or March 2009 right?

125
00:08:32,501 --> 00:08:32,722
Scott: How's?

126
00:08:32,743 --> 00:08:34,513
Scott: the Daily Show is gonna have to make fun of them?

127
00:08:34,695 --> 00:08:35,500
Scott: What are they gonna say?

128
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:38,248
Scott: I really want to see what those jokes are gonna be.

129
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:42,845
Rym: They'll be like well Obama's really Smiley today and Loki.

130
00:08:43,265 --> 00:08:44,410
Rym: Wow, you fixed the economy.

131
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,774
Rym: I was just great, wasn't it?

132
00:08:45,995 --> 00:08:54,120
Scott: I don't think that I'm not too sure about that Anyway, but what happened here is Hillary.

133
00:08:54,321 --> 00:09:01,253
Rym: I think in addition to that is kind of grasping at straws here these short stories that she her campaign threatened.

134
00:09:02,163 --> 00:09:09,560
Rym: Nancy Pelosi The house speaker who is Nancy Pelosi is a very interesting politician and I really really respect her.

135
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,410
Rym: She is one of the few people who is had.

136
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:12,892
Rym: she's like.

137
00:09:12,973 --> 00:09:17,849
Rym: she represents kind of this interesting Element that's starting to grow in the Democratic Party.

138
00:09:17,909 --> 00:09:18,912
Scott: What state is she from?

139
00:09:19,474 --> 00:09:21,038
Rym: You know, I don't even know where.

140
00:09:21,078 --> 00:09:21,500
Scott: what's her?

141
00:09:22,122 --> 00:09:24,188
Rym: You know, I only know district.

142
00:09:24,429 --> 00:09:27,980
Rym: I only know about her like national political house issues.

143
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,520
Rym: I don't know anything about her local.

144
00:09:29,601 --> 00:09:31,280
Scott: I'm gonna go look at a button.

145
00:09:31,722 --> 00:09:37,789
Rym: She is kind of on the forefront of this movement that if it comes to fruition It's kind of like for the long time.

146
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:42,691
Rym: The Democratic Party has had this Reputation in America as being the party.

147
00:09:42,731 --> 00:09:45,240
Rym: that isn't the Republican Party and that was mostly what made them.

148
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,426
Scott: They were Nancy Pelosi is.

149
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:52,154
Scott: she represents the 8th District of California.

150
00:09:52,294 --> 00:09:54,220
Rym: Oh, that's very close to my favorite district.

151
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,171
Scott: You know my district, you know what the 8th District of California is, huh?

152
00:09:59,134 --> 00:10:00,238
Scott: It's 4/5 of San Francisco.

153
00:10:01,202 --> 00:10:02,312
Rym: Well, there we go.

154
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:02,494
Scott: Yeah

155
00:10:04,502 --> 00:10:23,960
Rym: Like her and Howard Dean and there are a bunch of people who are kind of pushing the Democratic Party Toward being a party that has solid issues and stands up for what it believes in as opposed to the wishy-washy Democrats we've had for a long long time Except Jimmy Carter who was only portrayed to be wishy-washy, but it wasn't so much.

156
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:27,091
Rym: But anyway, I don't want to get into a crazy political thing here.

157
00:10:27,653 --> 00:10:39,279
Rym: So basically her campaign realized found out that Pelosi had basically said super delegates should probably vote for the candidate who has the most pledged delegates and go with.

158
00:10:39,379 --> 00:10:42,598
Rym: you know what the people in the Democratic Party want.

159
00:10:42,618 --> 00:10:50,219
Rym: and The Clinton campaign said hey don't say that You should take into account other factors.

160
00:10:50,681 --> 00:11:02,280
Rym: You know factors other than the popular vote or the electoral vote factors like something that has nothing to do with votes at all Like who might win against McCain or who did better in, Ohio?

161
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,429
Rym: Uh-huh, and she backed this up.

162
00:11:05,469 --> 00:11:07,278
Rym: It wasn't just a threat like hey stop that.

163
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:22,640
Rym: Basically they threatened her with a whole bunch of people who typically donate a lot of money to the Democratic Party Saying that they'll pull all their support from Pelosi and the people who are with her if she doesn't back down on this.

164
00:11:23,381 --> 00:11:38,680
Rym: hmm, and the thing is Nancy Pelosi is in a position to kind of decide who wins because a lot of people who are super Delegates will do whatever she says Mm-hmm, and she has not publicly supported someone but she supported the candidate with the most votes which cannot be anyone.

165
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,880
Rym: But Obama like almost nothing could happen to make Obama not have the majority of everything at the end of all this.

166
00:11:45,702 --> 00:11:48,350
Rym: So Nancy Pelosi's campaign.

167
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,132
Rym: Well not campaign.

168
00:11:49,393 --> 00:11:51,679
Rym: I keep saying campaign because you know the campaigns are going on.

169
00:11:52,542 --> 00:11:57,620
Rym: There was a response and the response is exactly what I would expect from someone cool like this.

170
00:11:58,002 --> 00:11:59,151
Rym: This is not actually from.

171
00:11:59,231 --> 00:12:00,340
Rym: they're not Nancy's words.

172
00:12:00,743 --> 00:12:02,939
Rym: They are the words of someone who speaks for Pelosi.

173
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:07,692
Rym: Speaker Pelosi is confident that super delegates will choose between senators.

174
00:12:07,732 --> 00:12:12,107
Rym: Clinton or Obama are two strong candidates Before the convention in August.

175
00:12:12,709 --> 00:12:22,760
Rym: that choice will be based on many considerations including Respecting the decisions of millions of Americans who have voted in primaries and participated in caucuses.

176
00:12:23,462 --> 00:12:30,928
Rym: the speaker believes that it would do great harm to the Democratic Party if super delegates are perceived to Overturn the will of the voters.

177
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:37,617
Rym: This has been her position throughout the primary season Regardless of who was ahead at any particular point in delegates or votes.

178
00:12:38,099 --> 00:12:44,737
Rym: now Notice how if you translate what she said into layman's terms Vote for Obama is what she said.

179
00:12:46,082 --> 00:12:49,338
Scott: So I think really a lot of what this stuff is is that?

180
00:12:50,681 --> 00:12:52,307
Scott: It's really not the people.

181
00:12:52,327 --> 00:12:54,476
Scott: It's not Hillary Clinton doing it's not.

182
00:12:54,616 --> 00:13:01,100
Scott: you know Obama It's all these people under them and it really shows you it's not real.

183
00:13:01,261 --> 00:13:04,800
Scott: It's the people under them to sort of control all this stuff that goes on.

184
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:05,724
Rym: Well, it's more that I mean.

185
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:09,160
Rym: Hillary does direct the campaign and she chooses who she wants running the campaign.

186
00:13:09,243 --> 00:13:15,760
Scott: And yeah But it really it seems like those people are a lot more of the decision-making and then the candidate just sort of like does.

187
00:13:15,981 --> 00:13:16,645
Rym: Well, no, I'm not.

188
00:13:16,726 --> 00:13:17,792
Rym: I'm even talking about like.

189
00:13:17,933 --> 00:13:19,464
Rym: oh the threat blah I'm not.

190
00:13:19,485 --> 00:13:21,060
Rym: I'm talking about the game of politics.

191
00:13:21,621 --> 00:13:30,199
Rym: What this says is that her campaign the experts running her campaign have realized that unless they do something drastic She cannot win.

192
00:13:30,642 --> 00:13:44,839
Rym: Resorting to something like this is an incredibly risky gambit Because if it doesn't go well and so far it has not gone Well, it can do nothing but harm her and remove the last chance she has to win which is winning the rest of the super delegates.

193
00:13:44,859 --> 00:13:50,340
Rym: and The fact that they have resorted to something like this means that they think she cannot win and this is their life.

194
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:54,699
Rym: this was like the great white hope and Now there's almost nothing she can do.

195
00:13:55,241 --> 00:14:06,360
Rym: I think that this is this is kind of like the bellwether of Hillary's campaign and I think that as of this response from Nancy Pelosi the race is over And the rest of it's just mopping up.

196
00:14:06,725 --> 00:14:09,327
Rym: I may be proven wrong But that is what I believe.

197
00:14:09,769 --> 00:14:15,299
Rym: and come the Democratic National Convention I will stand up for what I think was going to happen.

198
00:14:15,339 --> 00:14:17,543
Scott: when That convention.

199
00:14:18,225 --> 00:14:19,209
Rym: I wish I could go.

200
00:14:19,229 --> 00:14:22,078
Scott: I said I didn't say go why would you want to go?

201
00:14:22,098 --> 00:14:22,840
Scott: that'd be amazing.

202
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,167
Rym: I'd love to be at that convention.

203
00:14:24,187 --> 00:14:25,212
Scott: What are you gonna do there?

204
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:27,706
Scott: You're gonna stand it's gonna be crowded It's gonna be loud.

205
00:14:28,028 --> 00:14:28,451
Scott: You're not gonna.

206
00:14:28,491 --> 00:14:29,235
Scott: you don't do anything.

207
00:14:29,256 --> 00:14:30,000
Scott: You're not a delegate.

208
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,466
Scott: You just stand there.

209
00:14:31,526 --> 00:14:38,600
Rym: you realize that unless Hillary drops out technically it won't be decided Until the convention and that convention is gonna be mighty interesting.

210
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:42,034
Rym: It's also a nice way to hub nub, you know rub shoulders with.

211
00:14:42,074 --> 00:14:43,400
Rym: a lot of people are really into politics.

212
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,383
Rym: I think it would be fun.

213
00:14:44,464 --> 00:14:47,073
Scott: They're just a bunch of kooky old people usually or delegates.

214
00:14:47,314 --> 00:14:56,646
Rym: now this time around There's a good chance that a lot of Scott Johnson II and Remy type people are gonna be there and not a lot of Scott Rubins, I don't care about politics.

215
00:14:56,847 --> 00:14:57,569
Scott: Well, it's got Ruben.

216
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,794
Scott: I don't care about politics.

217
00:14:59,055 --> 00:14:59,978
Scott: It doesn't go anytime.

218
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:05,780
Rym: Anyway, Scott, the Democratic National Convention is going to take place after all of the primaries and caucuses.

219
00:15:05,921 --> 00:15:07,455
Rym: I think you can figure out when that is now.

220
00:15:07,475 --> 00:15:08,060
Rym: What do you got in the news?

221
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:08,785
Scott: I don't know when it is.

222
00:15:08,805 --> 00:15:09,814
Scott: I take a look at a calendar.

223
00:15:10,015 --> 00:15:10,580
Rym: It doesn't matter.

224
00:15:10,863 --> 00:15:12,360
Rym: I honestly believe that this was it.

225
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,123
Rym: This was the.

226
00:15:13,564 --> 00:15:14,026
Rym: this is like.

227
00:15:14,106 --> 00:15:14,929
Rym: this is the bellwether.

228
00:15:14,989 --> 00:15:16,514
Rym: There's that's the perfect word.

229
00:15:16,554 --> 00:15:17,538
Rym: I don't need another word.

230
00:15:17,939 --> 00:15:20,412
Scott: Whatever Alright, so here's the news.

231
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:27,620
Scott: That's actually important Raises a lot of questions to have an actual discussion, but did this affect you directly?

232
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:30,703
Scott: It doesn't.

233
00:15:30,844 --> 00:15:41,794
Rym: it affects me in that I can now use it as a step, okay Okay, I'm just pointing out that usually your argument against talking about politics is that it doesn't directly affect you right now It doesn't.

234
00:15:42,058 --> 00:15:48,740
Scott: but While this the actual story here does not affect me I can use this story as a weapon further in my life.

235
00:15:49,363 --> 00:15:53,958
Scott: I know it's sort of sad to use such a sad story as a weapon But well, you know what?

236
00:15:54,661 --> 00:15:57,334
Scott: I'm of the mind that I'm using it as a weapon for good.

237
00:15:57,395 --> 00:15:59,544
Scott: think of it as like a Sword of justice.

238
00:15:59,564 --> 00:16:02,999
Rym: what I was about to say is I know what Scott what's new Scott's about to talk about?

239
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:03,100
Rym: now?

240
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:10,214
Rym: I'll warn you all right now that this is not a the typical funny happy or Angry but in a funny Rym and Scott way news.

241
00:16:10,575 --> 00:16:21,740
Rym: and this is like, you know when Penn Jillette talks about some things on like the bullshit show and he's all funny and like Blah-blah-blah funny joke funny joke, and then there's a couple of times where he stops like this isn't funny what we're gonna talk about?

242
00:16:21,822 --> 00:16:24,737
Rym: I'm not kidding this isn't funny and that's what we're gonna talk about.

243
00:16:24,777 --> 00:16:35,977
Rym: but I would look at using this as a weapon or as a tool as more of kind of making the death mean something mmm, so There's a terrible news.

244
00:16:37,002 --> 00:16:37,807
Scott: There are some people.

245
00:16:38,391 --> 00:16:43,189
Scott: they lived out in Wisconsin right.

246
00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:44,320
Scott: so that already tells you something.

247
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,117
Scott: And they had a family that tell you Wisconsin is the Midwest.

248
00:16:49,177 --> 00:16:49,860
Rym: It's not that bad.

249
00:16:50,721 --> 00:16:53,170
Scott: Anyway, anyway, well, it's West in Wisconsin.

250
00:16:53,391 --> 00:16:54,174
Rym: I don't know where that is.

251
00:16:54,234 --> 00:16:54,837
Rym: I'll look it up.

252
00:16:54,897 --> 00:17:09,910
Scott: Yeah, you anyway anyway, you lived in Wisconsin and they had a. but they're just a family with a bunch of kids and one of the kids was 11 year old girl and She had diabetes Kito acidosis keto acidosis.

253
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:13,020
Rym: That's what happens when you go on Adkins for too long in an improper way.

254
00:17:13,201 --> 00:17:21,066
Scott: Yeah, basically she had diabetes diabetes, whatever and They she never went to a doctor from the time.

255
00:17:21,126 --> 00:17:22,989
Scott: She was three to the time.

256
00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:24,827
Scott: She was 11.

257
00:17:24,827 --> 00:17:37,560
Rym: now I point out that untreated diabetes Completely untreated is almost invariably fatal and causes Horrible numerous medical problems pretty much continuously.

258
00:17:38,142 --> 00:17:43,520
Scott: We now know that the diabetes well, it's undiagnosed diabetes because they never went to a doctor.

259
00:17:44,001 --> 00:17:47,485
Scott: But we know it was entirely treatable entirely.

260
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:50,890
Scott: if they would have gone to a doctor the girl would have been just fine.

261
00:17:51,842 --> 00:17:56,500
Rym: She would have lived the same life that millions of people worldwide who have diabetes like that live.

262
00:17:56,681 --> 00:17:59,412
Scott: She would have taken some insulin shots and whatnot.

263
00:17:59,673 --> 00:18:01,480
Rym: This isn't like some rare exotic disease.

264
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:05,274
Rym: This was this is something that was solved a long time ago.

265
00:18:05,294 --> 00:18:14,079
Scott: Yep, but on Sunday She died because she didn't have enough insulin because they never went to a doctor and got insulin shots or anything.

266
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,399
Rym: now Did they not go to the doctor because they were too far poor?

267
00:18:18,081 --> 00:18:19,225
Rym: Was there a reason they didn't go?

268
00:18:19,245 --> 00:18:31,979
Scott: even if you're poor you could have at least run to the emergency room when she was really Sick, right and she was really sick for like, you know the keto acidosis Which is you know, sort of like, you know, sort of like the AIDS is to the HIV.

269
00:18:32,321 --> 00:18:43,680
Rym: Well that what a way keto acidosis is when you're starving to death and your body is breaking down Fats and whatever whatever it can even muscle in order to get you the energy you need to continue to live.

270
00:18:44,042 --> 00:18:50,213
Scott: Yeah, but without insulin it's not gonna help very much Because there was no insulin.

271
00:18:50,233 --> 00:18:51,040
Rym: that's why it was happening.

272
00:18:51,124 --> 00:18:56,980
Rym: Yes Anyway, the medical bit here that the point I want to drive home before because this isn't the news really.

273
00:18:57,061 --> 00:18:59,300
Rym: This is just the kind of the precursor of the story.

274
00:18:59,741 --> 00:19:04,920
Rym: But there was nothing preventing this family from getting medical help for their daughter?

275
00:19:05,341 --> 00:19:06,265
Scott: No, nothing at all.

276
00:19:06,305 --> 00:19:14,996
Scott: They they could have gone to the doctor at any time and even they could have even gone to the emergency Room, she was you know, very ill and here here he is.

277
00:19:15,036 --> 00:19:16,000
Scott: These the exact thing.

278
00:19:16,383 --> 00:19:18,520
Scott: She had been ill for about a month.

279
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:27,540
Scott: So even though she had diabetes for a long time for about a month She was suffering symptoms such as nausea vomiting excessive thirst loss of appetite and weakness.

280
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:31,975
Scott: So they had a month to go to the emergency room for free and they didn't.

281
00:19:32,858 --> 00:19:33,280
Scott: why?

282
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,683
Scott: Well, they didn't.

283
00:19:35,764 --> 00:19:39,620
Scott: it says here that they have nothing against doctors, right?

284
00:19:40,641 --> 00:19:43,380
Scott: They did not belong to an organized religion or faith.

285
00:19:43,481 --> 00:19:54,857
Scott: They're not fanatics But they believe in the Bible and they believe that healing comes from God and they opted to pray To God or to a God they believe in rather than go to the doctor.

286
00:19:54,877 --> 00:19:57,992
Rym: now You said that they have other children.

287
00:19:58,615 --> 00:19:58,978
Scott: They do.

288
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:04,740
Rym: I Don't think there's really any debate about the fact that those children should not be left in their care.

289
00:20:05,062 --> 00:20:07,080
Scott: No, I don't think there's any debate about that other.

290
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:15,860
Rym: Otherwise, I think the only debate here honestly is whether or not they should be imprisoned or whether they should be committed.

291
00:20:17,022 --> 00:20:26,279
Scott: Yeah, I mean it's a tough call though because it's like You know, if you have a child, you know, you're you're sort of you're responsible for taking care of it.

292
00:20:26,523 --> 00:20:30,897
Rym: Yes Both morally and legally until the child is 18 years old unless they're emancipated.

293
00:20:30,937 --> 00:20:34,870
Rym: in the United States The parents are responsible for taking for the care of the children.

294
00:20:35,131 --> 00:20:42,510
Scott: Yeah, and if you don't do that responsibility There's uh, there's laws about that like neglect and whatnot.

295
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:48,983
Scott: And it does say that there are police investigating the family But I don't really see What you know.

296
00:20:49,003 --> 00:20:56,105
Scott: the investigation would take me like five minutes because pretty much the family like admits it and There was an aunt of the family.

297
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:56,506
Scott: Let's see.

298
00:20:56,907 --> 00:20:59,615
Scott: My sister-in-law is very religious.

299
00:20:59,655 --> 00:21:01,480
Scott: She believes in faith instead of doctors.

300
00:21:02,682 --> 00:21:05,192
Scott: She called my mother-in-law today and she explained to us that she believes.

301
00:21:05,232 --> 00:21:07,576
Scott: her daughter's in a coma right now and she's relying on faith.

302
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,027
Scott: Yeah This is the kind of thing, you know.

303
00:21:12,228 --> 00:21:18,089
Scott: people come and they're like, oh you're so mean You know, we we might believe in crazy things.

304
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:20,436
Scott: we you know, we do good and we help people.

305
00:21:20,456 --> 00:21:29,200
Scott: and the thing is If you didn't have the faith in the first place the faith introduces the possibility of this sort of thing happening.

306
00:21:29,926 --> 00:21:31,720
Scott: If you didn't have faith, this would be not possible.

307
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:37,295
Scott: There'd be no chance of this kind of crazy thing happening where you know, and the thing is right.

308
00:21:37,495 --> 00:21:40,203
Scott: they prayed their daughter died So what do they do?

309
00:21:40,725 --> 00:21:42,411
Scott: They remain strong for their children.

310
00:21:42,531 --> 00:21:44,338
Scott: only our faith in God is giving us strength.

311
00:21:44,358 --> 00:21:53,020
Rym: at this time I don't even want you still I don't even want to get into the argument of you know Well that that means technically that God killed your daughter.

312
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,225
Rym: Why do you still trust him?

313
00:21:54,265 --> 00:21:54,345
Rym: or?

314
00:21:54,626 --> 00:22:00,639
Rym: but then the argument against that is well God had a reason for killing the daughter But what kind of God is that?

315
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:07,064
Rym: yeah, it's like but that's not even the argument I want to have because Arguing Oh religion blah.

316
00:22:07,566 --> 00:22:12,760
Rym: There's much more the issue of what do we do in this situation in society?

317
00:22:13,141 --> 00:22:14,623
Rym: People who make decisions like this.

318
00:22:14,743 --> 00:22:22,620
Rym: I mean, it's one thing if someone makes a decision that harms only them and If I and the pride like fake medicine is example.

319
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:32,127
Rym: There are a lot of people who get cancer or something and they rely on Alternative medicine and as a result they die of something that might have been treatable or they get.

320
00:22:32,527 --> 00:22:32,808
Scott: usually.

321
00:22:32,848 --> 00:22:43,814
Scott: what happens though to those people is They get that, you know Their symptoms worsen and worsen and worsen and then when they're really sick They finally go to the real doctor and they end up worse off than they would have been but they don't.

322
00:22:44,095 --> 00:22:46,680
Scott: they don't die often But they die or a lot.

323
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:53,932
Rym: Well, it happens a lot of times is a cancer or something that would have been treatable progresses to an untreatable states Before they go and seek medical help.

324
00:22:54,173 --> 00:23:07,399
Rym: Yep, but again, there's there's kind of the argument that the only reason the seed of even believing in Fake medicine or something like that is there is because a lot of our society it legitimizes these things.

325
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:22,795
Rym: Letting people sell that airborne product or an herbal medicine that is clearly fake or homeopathic remedies in stores Creates this sort of legitimacy in people's minds Even if it's just very subtle that well that sort of thing is possible.

326
00:23:22,855 --> 00:23:26,168
Rym: Keep an open mind or yeah Well, there's a lot we don't know.

327
00:23:26,228 --> 00:23:28,780
Rym: So maybe acupuncture works and I don't want it's not it.

328
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:41,180
Rym: I don't want to make a slippery slope argument But keeping that door open makes it very easy for people to fall further and further down the line Until things that are less and less plausible seem more and more plausible.

329
00:23:41,682 --> 00:23:44,611
Rym: But at least if someone does that it only hurts them.

330
00:23:45,414 --> 00:23:51,495
Rym: So I don't What about this situation where it didn't just hurt it killed a little girl.

331
00:23:51,816 --> 00:23:55,651
Scott: Yeah, pretty much I mean look at like, you know people.

332
00:23:55,832 --> 00:23:56,977
Scott: there are plenty of people out there.

333
00:23:57,037 --> 00:24:02,440
Scott: take for example I keep forgetting the guy's name the guy who's like the famous, you know human genome project guy.

334
00:24:02,521 --> 00:24:05,399
Scott: But he says it's okay to believe in God or whatever, right?

335
00:24:05,761 --> 00:24:14,230
Scott: So while he's all science and I'm sure he would take his children to a doctor being a you know, world-famous Biologist who's like, you know, I did he win Nobel Prize.

336
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:17,480
Scott: I'm mad of you know, super famous super smart, right?

337
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:22,620
Scott: You know the faith that he has is probably not going to result in anyone being hurt.

338
00:24:23,223 --> 00:24:25,798
Scott: but he wrote a book, you know defending that.

339
00:24:25,818 --> 00:24:35,897
Scott: and You know if he writes a book that says it's okay to believe in something without evidence Then you have other people where it's okay to believe in other things that evidence.

340
00:24:36,158 --> 00:24:41,060
Scott: and thus You have these people believing in something without evidence and they kill somebody.

341
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:51,512
Scott: I don't want to say that that guy is responsible for killing someone I'm not I'm not going that far but we really you shouldn't be you know Emphasizing that kind of thinking.

342
00:24:51,552 --> 00:25:05,035
Scott: you shouldn't validate it You shouldn't respect it because it's that kind of thinking even if you know this person who thinks it is not doing any harm And that person who does think it is, you know, you might say Oh, well the people who aren't doing any harm are doing the harm.

343
00:25:05,075 --> 00:25:05,578
Scott: The people are are.

344
00:25:06,621 --> 00:25:12,860
Scott: Well, the problem is is if you didn't have that kind of thinking this kind of harm would never happen.

345
00:25:13,302 --> 00:25:17,157
Scott: It only happens because that kind of thinking is legitimized and respected.

346
00:25:17,178 --> 00:25:19,480
Rym: now Don't get us wrong.

347
00:25:19,606 --> 00:25:27,829
Rym: I mean I believe in freedom above all else as people are free to speak their beliefs and Say whatever they want whenever they want.

348
00:25:28,191 --> 00:26:03,890
Rym: as far as I'm concerned and there's nothing wrong with writing books about these things saying that you believe in these things believing in these things, but at the same time that is why people who believe in these things even if they do otherwise great things or otherwise respected or otherwise intelligent I Cannot respect them as human beings because I feel as though their legitimization of these ideas Indirectly leads to what just happened where this little girl died over something so ludicrous that I Don't even know what should be done with these parents.

349
00:26:04,472 --> 00:26:05,977
Scott: Yeah, I mean these parents aren't.

350
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:16,160
Scott: well They're not outwardly dangerous people like usually the argument for prison is like, you know You put this person because if you let this person roam around they're going to you know hurt people.

351
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,100
Scott: They're gonna shoot people and stab and go crazy.

352
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:25,927
Rym: So you put them in a prison where they can't hurt anybody but they are dangerous to those under their care Those for whom they have power.

353
00:26:26,569 --> 00:26:36,040
Rym: Oh, so as a result in the very least there is pretty much no argument That could sway me to believe that any child should be left in their care for the rest of their lives.

354
00:26:36,402 --> 00:26:37,369
Scott: No, I don't think that.

355
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,839
Scott: here's the other thing though, right?

356
00:26:39,503 --> 00:26:43,126
Scott: You can take away their children But what if they make more?

357
00:26:43,447 --> 00:26:50,586
Scott: now we have to take them away and now that means these people are free To create more children there.

358
00:26:50,667 --> 00:27:02,979
Rym: They're basically they have the right to create a burden on society, but at the same time Neither one of us can make the argument that forced sterilization or and something along those lines is even.

359
00:27:02,999 --> 00:27:07,279
Rym: I mean It's a laughable idea and I don't know what to do.

360
00:27:07,822 --> 00:27:11,720
Rym: I don't think they should go to prison because that doesn't solve anything.

361
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:14,652
Rym: All it does is remove two people who are somewhat.

362
00:27:14,692 --> 00:27:21,700
Scott: they're moderately productive in society I'm sure they have jobs and do work and whatnot, you know, and they're probably not see.

363
00:27:21,941 --> 00:27:24,777
Scott: this is the really hard part of this and what makes it so hard.

364
00:27:24,797 --> 00:27:34,256
Scott: and Why atheists, you know get it like a bad rap when they you know Yell at these kind of people is because these people are good intentioned, you know, they they meant well.

365
00:27:34,918 --> 00:27:46,640
Scott: and it's like You know when you yell it when someone means well and they have good in their hearts and you go and you say you're a Terrible person, you know, it's like it makes you look like a bad person.

366
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:55,500
Scott: But really if you mean well and let's say I'm trying to like help someone and I think that you know Jumping up and down is gonna help them.

367
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:58,680
Scott: So I jump up and down but jumping up and down is actually hurting them.

368
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,417
Scott: But I just think it's helping them because I don't know any better that it's like I think I'm helping.

369
00:28:03,457 --> 00:28:05,528
Scott: I'm a good person I'm trying to help.

370
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:12,646
Scott: I'm you know, my heart is in it but I don't have the knowledge to actually help and I cause harm because of that.

371
00:28:13,147 --> 00:28:19,641
Scott: and then some mean guy comes along and tells me I'm Eviling crazy and I'm doing harm and I'm bad and I shouldn't be doing that.

372
00:28:19,822 --> 00:28:22,790
Rym: So in this case now, what do we do?

373
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:31,373
Rym: I mean my in my opinion the the first cause maybe not the but like the first thing that the justice system or a Justice system.

374
00:28:31,814 --> 00:28:41,850
Rym: what justice is should do is to as best as can be done Undo or mitigate the harm that was done, but the harm can't be undone the girls dead.

375
00:28:42,473 --> 00:28:54,642
Rym: So moving on the next thing that a justice system should do is within reasonable bounds and at reasonable cost prevent Foreseeable future harm and that can be done by taking away the children.

376
00:28:54,682 --> 00:28:56,950
Scott: taking away their other children is is obvious.

377
00:28:57,111 --> 00:28:58,495
Scott: There's no question about that one.

378
00:28:58,535 --> 00:28:59,679
Scott: But what about?

379
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:00,261
Scott: you know, they can.

380
00:29:00,281 --> 00:29:03,050
Scott: there's still the they're allowed to make more children.

381
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:09,834
Scott: No one can stop them from doing that and that will create a burden on society and cause harm because we can't let them keep Their new children.

382
00:29:09,854 --> 00:29:10,838
Scott: we have to take them away.

383
00:29:10,858 --> 00:29:26,298
Rym: and then we you know, it creates a burden on you know Orphanages or whatever, you know There's the foster homes and such the third notion the third order away from this which is almost a subset which is prevent future harm directly and That could be.

384
00:29:26,318 --> 00:29:31,590
Rym: there are a number of ways to do that But most of them involve limiting these people's freedom and effectively removing them from society.

385
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:40,918
Rym: It also starts to tread into the cruel and unusual terror not even that it goes into the fourth order, which is punishment, which is really.

386
00:29:40,938 --> 00:29:52,030
Rym: there's a fine line between deterrence and revenge and I'm of the mind that deterrence is a very valid idea and I think that it's something that should always be a part.

387
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:55,784
Scott: Well, is there something that we could do to punish these people?

388
00:29:55,804 --> 00:30:03,732
Scott: that would deter other Crazy religious people from keeping their kids away from the doctor so that you know We would do?

389
00:30:03,813 --> 00:30:11,382
Scott: we would somehow make an example of these parents and then other Similar people would then see that and bring their kids to the doctor.

390
00:30:11,503 --> 00:30:13,390
Scott: now the problem is what could we do that would make?

391
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:13,932
Scott: That happen.

392
00:30:14,153 --> 00:30:22,464
Rym: I don't think there's anything we could do because anyone who believes something like this I if anything they would see these parents as martyrs if they were punished in any way.

393
00:30:22,885 --> 00:30:38,608
Rym: and thus that leaves us with the final order, which is revenge and Revenge, I think while it is a very ingrained part of human society Revenge for the sake of revenge as opposed to quote unquote revenge for a deterrent effect.

394
00:30:38,648 --> 00:30:39,410
Rym: That is measurable.

395
00:30:40,012 --> 00:30:51,864
Rym: it's kind of like the difference between I'm a general and I'm in an army and I in a country invades my country so I March into their capital burn it to the ground and utterly destroy all of their armies.

396
00:30:52,165 --> 00:30:57,770
Rym: I go far above and beyond and At least that's a deterrent effect in that.

397
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:03,470
Rym: Alright the horrible thing I have done is done, but it will prevent a future horrible thing from happening.

398
00:31:04,073 --> 00:31:13,115
Rym: But a lot of people say they're doing something like that but what they're actually doing what is truly in their hearts is nothing more than revenge and The deterrent effect is little or nothing.

399
00:31:13,536 --> 00:31:17,790
Rym: I point to many instances of the death penalty being enacted in the United States.

400
00:31:18,071 --> 00:31:22,374
Scott: Yeah, it's like I don't like even if I was the king of the world Right, like.

401
00:31:22,415 --> 00:31:25,710
Scott: I don't feel like a desire for revenge on these people.

402
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:37,596
Scott: I just feel a need to set these people straight, but then you know you get in Anti freedom there, you know some, you know reeducation 19 1984 style.

403
00:31:37,636 --> 00:31:43,322
Rym: punishment should only exist to change Future behavior for the better or to help.

404
00:31:43,864 --> 00:31:45,310
Rym: it should never be solely to harm.

405
00:31:45,771 --> 00:31:48,459
Rym: But we've already shown that there's really no punishment.

406
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:55,190
Rym: I think that could have any effect on anyone else committing a crime like this and There's very little we can do against these people.

407
00:31:56,312 --> 00:31:59,250
Rym: So the only option is to I don't know commit them.

408
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:03,166
Rym: But we don't have the in the asylum infrastructure in this country that we need.

409
00:32:03,226 --> 00:32:05,697
Scott: well because we had Asylums and they were terrible.

410
00:32:06,038 --> 00:32:10,415
Scott: The thing is instead of reforming them to make them not terrible We just got rid of them.

411
00:32:10,455 --> 00:32:17,222
Scott: and now all the people who normally would be in asylum are either in prison I'm on the street prison or they're homeless.

412
00:32:17,583 --> 00:32:18,929
Scott: or they're these people.

413
00:32:18,949 --> 00:32:31,147
Rym: and Also if we if we agree that the only option is to commit them because they are a danger to themselves and others But they mean no harm and prison is no option because the deterrent effect will.

414
00:32:31,207 --> 00:32:32,270
Rym: there is no deterrent effect.

415
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:34,501
Rym: it won't deter anyone else from doing things like this.

416
00:32:34,883 --> 00:32:35,807
Rym: all it will do is punish.

417
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:40,208
Rym: so a reasonable asylum something that barely exists in this country is the only option.

418
00:32:40,248 --> 00:32:43,708
Rym: but that brings up my final point.

419
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:50,867
Rym: if People who do have had these beliefs are committed to an asylum for having these beliefs and for acting on them.

420
00:32:50,887 --> 00:33:01,970
Rym: I honestly contend that the beliefs of Christianity Islam and religious Judaism are no less crazy and make no less sense.

421
00:33:02,471 --> 00:33:08,949
Rym: The only difference is that those people either act out fewer of their beliefs or believe in fewer of these things.

422
00:33:10,352 --> 00:33:14,190
Scott: Or they you know, they say they believe but they don't really which is a lot of people.

423
00:33:14,471 --> 00:33:24,963
Scott: I mean, I really think that the vast majority of people are good intentioned even the crazy Suicide bombers, you know, they they have good intentions.

424
00:33:25,064 --> 00:33:28,617
Scott: Like they think that what they are doing is good No one thinks I'm evil.

425
00:33:28,677 --> 00:33:29,763
Scott: I'm going to take over the world.

426
00:33:29,824 --> 00:33:30,588
Scott: Mwahahaha.

427
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:44,561
Scott: They think that what they are going to do is going to make the world a better place Because they believe that if they do this then this will happen and then something else will happen and then there'll be some sort Of you know paradise on earth when everyone believes in Muhammad and whatnot.

428
00:33:45,002 --> 00:33:47,770
Scott: now the thing it's everyone has good intentions.

429
00:33:48,212 --> 00:33:51,330
Scott: They just because they don't believe in things.

430
00:33:51,651 --> 00:33:55,162
Rym: Christian saying that the road to hell is paved with good intentions.

431
00:33:55,382 --> 00:34:02,910
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know, they The things that they believe are about the real world are not true.

432
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:14,370
Scott: Therefore when they try to make decisions about how to affect the real world Their decisions do not get the results that they desire because they are but those decisions are based on false information.

433
00:34:15,092 --> 00:34:18,590
Scott: So only people who believe in just what's real or what's you know?

434
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:24,929
Scott: Very probable are you know going to almost always make the best decisions that are possible?

435
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:31,449
Scott: Given the resources and knowledge available to the human race at this time, so I respect philosophy.

436
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:34,377
Rym: I Deeply respect spirituality.

437
00:34:34,717 --> 00:34:37,045
Rym: Actually my thing of the day will be very relevant to that.

438
00:34:37,107 --> 00:34:38,010
Scott: Are you gonna use that one?

439
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:38,655
Rym: I have to.

440
00:34:38,715 --> 00:34:39,443
Rym: it's too relevant.

441
00:34:39,665 --> 00:34:48,047
Rym: All right spirituality and philosophy and thought experiments and possibilities and optimism and hope are very important things.

442
00:34:48,068 --> 00:34:53,888
Rym: and There's a lot out there in this universe and we haven't seen even a fraction of it.

443
00:34:53,987 --> 00:34:58,785
Rym: So Saying that there's nothing out there that we could that we couldn't comprehend or nothing out there.

444
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:01,376
Rym: That's special and nothing out there That's crazy or nothing out there.

445
00:35:01,396 --> 00:35:02,420
Rym: That's amazing or nothing.

446
00:35:03,043 --> 00:35:09,333
Rym: even saying that out there somewhere There couldn't be beings that are like gods or like aliens anything like that None of that.

447
00:35:09,353 --> 00:35:12,142
Rym: It's it's not even an issue because it could be out there.

448
00:35:12,182 --> 00:35:13,246
Rym: The possibility is there.

449
00:35:13,306 --> 00:35:24,790
Rym: and a lot of people misrepresent atheism as not say they say they think that atheism means that there is no chance of spirituality that There is that there is a belief that there is absolutely no chance.

450
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:30,350
Scott: Yeah, you'll see a lot of people say I'm not atheist of agnostic blood when really no you're you're atheist.

451
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:31,433
Scott: You just you don't.

452
00:35:31,553 --> 00:35:34,581
Scott: you don't like the word atheism or you know, you don't understand.

453
00:35:34,902 --> 00:35:44,745
Rym: atheism does not mean that I believe earnestly and truly that there is nothing in this world outside of what I observed.

454
00:35:45,267 --> 00:35:51,309
Rym: it means that I only Accept as true in my life things that have been observed and everything else.

455
00:35:52,232 --> 00:35:54,399
Scott: And because it's I mean it could be.

456
00:35:54,660 --> 00:36:00,239
Scott: but if I made my decisions based on things that could be Then how would I make a decision based on anything?

457
00:36:00,299 --> 00:36:03,410
Scott: I mean, you know a lightning could strike randomly.

458
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:07,430
Scott: Maybe I shouldn't step forward one space, you know, maybe I should walk backwards instead?

459
00:36:07,511 --> 00:36:07,935
Scott: I don't know.

460
00:36:08,177 --> 00:36:08,339
Rym: so.

461
00:36:08,743 --> 00:36:15,929
Rym: at the same time there are a lot of closely held beliefs and a lot of hosts closely held philosophies and things people feel in their hearts.

462
00:36:15,949 --> 00:36:26,409
Rym: and that's one thing and This is the other problem that a lot of times the arguments of atheists are conflated with general arguments against believing in anything.

463
00:36:26,429 --> 00:36:39,704
Rym: and That is why I really have to say that I can't say if you believe something That I agree or disagree with it until I've thought about it and there are an infinite number of possible things that you could believe or hope for.

464
00:36:40,652 --> 00:36:55,549
Rym: but what I can say is that if it presented with a specific belief I can evaluate it and That is why regardless of my beliefs and feelings and philosophies and regardless of all the possible things out there that anyone could conceive of.

465
00:36:55,569 --> 00:37:09,149
Rym: I can say very strongly that I believe I Cannot respect a person who honestly believes in Christianity Islam or Judaism or anything else but I do ism.

466
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:11,087
Rym: Well, I just I don't want to get into the.

467
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:12,173
Rym: you know There's a million things.

468
00:37:12,193 --> 00:37:17,270
Rym: there's shades and a lot of religious ideas edged toward philosophy and then they're not religion anymore.

469
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:20,539
Rym: And you can't just say don't believe in anything.

470
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:22,303
Rym: You can say don't believe in things.

471
00:37:22,363 --> 00:37:28,942
Rym: I haven't seen or you can say I Evaluate statements and beliefs based when they are brought forth.

472
00:37:29,283 --> 00:37:30,467
Rym: You can't argue generally.

473
00:37:30,487 --> 00:37:31,610
Rym: you have to argue specifically.

474
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:44,936
Rym: So just to clarify it's there I. there are specific things that I don't believe and that atheists in general don't believe Because there is no evidence for and in all of human history There is evidence against.

475
00:37:45,297 --> 00:37:51,350
Rym: we have very clear evidence of the secular origins of Christianity Islam and Judaism.

476
00:37:51,791 --> 00:37:54,179
Rym: We know historically where they came from.

477
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,310
Rym: we can see a lot of where these beliefs evolved.

478
00:37:57,691 --> 00:38:03,190
Rym: We can see about when parts of the Bible were written and which parts were excised and what was changed.

479
00:38:03,932 --> 00:38:06,139
Rym: We know a lot about people who were like Jesus.

480
00:38:06,179 --> 00:38:24,521
Rym: a lot of people claim to be the Jewish Messiah back in the days of Rome so to believe in these things where there is no evidence for and Some evidence against is ludicrous and I really can't Fathom or respect people who actually believe in these specific three things.

481
00:38:24,922 --> 00:38:47,030
Scott: and when I do see people who are like that Because I have good intentions and because I make decisions based on you know What I see and what you know is is real the colloquial real, you know I just I have to try my best to you know, help the people, you know The the people who believe in Jesus and stuff.

482
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:51,934
Scott: They're always trying to help people because they think that if they convince people to believe in Jesus They'll help them.

483
00:38:52,437 --> 00:38:55,050
Scott: and you know, everyone's like, oh, they're they're pushy.

484
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:56,530
Scott: We don't like people pushing stuff.

485
00:38:56,851 --> 00:39:02,030
Scott: But you know, I might you know, there's something to say about trying to you know, push things and other people.

486
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:13,308
Scott: But if I would have successfully pushed, you know atheism on this family, I would have saved someone's life whereas, you know pushing Jesus would have not helped.

487
00:39:13,328 --> 00:39:23,410
Scott: because So, you know while it may look like we're arrogant and pushy and trying to you know You say oh, we're no better than Jehovah's Witnesses trying to convert people blood.

488
00:39:23,551 --> 00:39:24,254
Rym: I just want to clarify.

489
00:39:24,274 --> 00:39:27,370
Rym: when Scott says we I don't think he means myself and him specific.

490
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:29,440
Scott: No, I mean the colloquial.

491
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:32,774
Scott: we yes atheist the total we Not.

492
00:39:32,815 --> 00:39:36,198
Scott: we mean someone else Me we and everybody.

493
00:39:36,378 --> 00:39:38,247
Rym: but I think it's a very important distinction here.

494
00:39:38,267 --> 00:39:41,629
Scott: Yes Alright, let's go on to things of the day and fun again.

495
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:50,977
Rym: So moving on to things of the day.

496
00:39:51,499 --> 00:39:56,096
Rym: Here is the thing of the day that I referred to earlier And this let me do mine first.

497
00:39:56,377 --> 00:39:57,342
Rym: Okay, you can do yours first.

498
00:39:57,623 --> 00:39:58,768
Scott: Okay, this is real simple.

499
00:39:58,809 --> 00:39:59,130
Scott: You ready?

500
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:01,417
Scott: I'm gonna read to you the paragraph.

501
00:40:02,019 --> 00:40:05,009
Scott: This is totally gonna be like the tangent in the middle of the show to lighten it up.

502
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:12,650
Scott: ready breathe engage your five senses Close your eyes and inhale deeply.

503
00:40:13,874 --> 00:40:15,268
Scott: Be in the present moment.

504
00:40:16,032 --> 00:40:20,290
Scott: Notice the color of the chocolate the glossy shine.

505
00:40:21,411 --> 00:40:31,810
Scott: rub your thumb over the chocolate bar to a release the aromas of Smoked applewood bacon flirting with deep milk chocolate.

506
00:40:32,871 --> 00:40:36,640
Scott: Snap off just a tiny piece and place it in your mouth.

507
00:40:37,302 --> 00:40:40,530
Scott: Let the lust of salt and sweet coat your tongue.

508
00:40:41,538 --> 00:40:42,689
Scott: Moe's bacon bar.

509
00:40:43,432 --> 00:40:48,430
Scott: Applewood smoked bacon plus alderwood smoked salt plus deep milk chocolate.

510
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:52,201
Scott: 41% cocoa consumed within eight weeks.

511
00:40:52,743 --> 00:40:54,047
Scott: seven dollars and fifty cents.

512
00:40:54,509 --> 00:41:01,786
Rym: that Sounds like one of the most wonderful things that has ever graced this earth.

513
00:41:02,468 --> 00:41:11,007
Scott: I got one more Flying chocolate pig more bacon and chocolate exclamation part solid milk chocolate flying pigs.

514
00:41:11,288 --> 00:41:11,890
Scott: twelve dollars.

515
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:15,658
Rym: You know, I think I'm wrong.

516
00:41:15,678 --> 00:41:20,859
Rym: There is a God there must be All right.

517
00:41:21,362 --> 00:41:29,915
Rym: So my thing of the day this is kind of shared because Scott and I both wanted to bring this up and this is one Of those things where neither one of us can claim credit like oh, I found this.

518
00:41:29,955 --> 00:41:34,770
Rym: someone posted it in the forum But there's a man whose name was Alan Watts.

519
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:36,154
Rym: He died a long time ago.

520
00:41:36,375 --> 00:41:37,297
Scott: Not that long ago.

521
00:41:37,377 --> 00:41:41,059
Scott: Just a few decades 1973 this man was born.

522
00:41:41,822 --> 00:41:43,037
Rym: World War one.

523
00:41:43,672 --> 00:41:47,400
Rym: Yeah Anyway, Alan why I'm not gonna talk about Alan Watts?

524
00:41:47,501 --> 00:41:54,082
Scott: I feel like I should do a separate show But we'd have to learn more about Alan Watts because we sort of just discovered him and now everyone's all the smarter people than us Are going.

525
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:55,070
Scott: oh you morons.

526
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:56,280
Scott: I can't believe you didn't know who that was.

527
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:57,540
Scott: But

528
00:41:58,181 --> 00:42:31,440
Rym: what has been posted in our forum is a video that you all should watch because this is a video that kind of Expresses better than I would have been more eloquently and more concisely what I meant by spirituality because you see Scott and I and pretty much everyone in the front row crew and pretty much everyone I Associate with and talk to and know in my life is an atheist and A lot of us are very spiritual and anyone who thinks that's a contradiction needs to watch this video to understand Why I don't think that's the case.

529
00:42:31,461 --> 00:42:37,886
Rym: Mm-hmm this is kind of a a mishmash of things that Alan Watts has said and overlaid with.

530
00:42:37,926 --> 00:42:55,402
Rym: this is some animation and It it's so concisely and perfectly expresses these ideas that there's very little I can say about it other than that the sound that people make when they went when the earth is peopling is Exactly the sound that people make when the earth is people.

531
00:42:55,663 --> 00:42:57,789
Scott: it basically the deal with this video is that?

532
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:01,861
Scott: The South Park guys took a few things.

533
00:43:01,982 --> 00:43:04,410
Scott: Alan Watts said, you know, they took audio of him speaking.

534
00:43:04,711 --> 00:43:26,294
Scott: You know some sound bites and then they created animations to go with those sound bites and the one you know all of it is fantastic, but of course the part where the apple tree produces apples as compared to the earth producing people is the greatest part and That you know sound effect of the people going Is Awesome,

535
00:43:26,516 --> 00:43:26,759
Rym: I don't.

536
00:43:26,779 --> 00:43:27,990
Rym: I particularly like the line.

537
00:43:28,311 --> 00:43:30,798
Rym: So where there's rocks watch out watch out.

538
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:46,610
Rym: actually though ugly Fred in the forum was the last person to post in the thread I'm looking at it right now Pointed out that probably the most poignant part and I have to agree Definitely have to agree was the last bit because I see so many people make this mistake in their lives.

539
00:43:46,851 --> 00:43:54,000
Rym: I see people in my current life in the process of making this mistake But I'm not gonna really explain it.

540
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:56,649
Rym: but here's kind of a quote from the third bit.

541
00:43:57,573 --> 00:44:02,150
Rym: Well, it was a hoax a dreadful hoax because life is music and you were supposed to be singing.

542
00:44:02,913 --> 00:44:07,330
Rym: It's the myth of the real world that we're all supposed to reach some magical fabled day of attainment.

543
00:44:07,774 --> 00:44:10,273
Rym: Well, fuck that it's the biggest lie I was ever told.

544
00:44:10,654 --> 00:44:15,409
Rym: life is real right now and never let anyone railroad your life choices because it's what you're supposed to do.

545
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:23,739
Rym: that is that's somewhat quoted from ugly Fred in the forum and When you see the third bit, you'll get what I you'll.

546
00:44:23,779 --> 00:44:25,705
Rym: you'll understand the significance of that.

547
00:44:25,725 --> 00:44:26,608
Rym: Mm-hmm.

548
00:44:27,129 --> 00:44:40,414
Scott: So going to talk about Monty pythons flying circus It's But We took too long.

549
00:44:40,695 --> 00:44:51,010
Rym: Yeah, I don't want to waste Monty Python on either doing a two-hour long show Oh my god, because I want to make some dinner or on, you know, five minutes of talking about Monty Python.

550
00:44:51,151 --> 00:45:01,136
Rym: Also, I don't know if you're all in the mood to hear about Monty Python when effectively we just did in defense of atheism You know, what can we do with the you know, horrible news like that, you know How could I not do that news?

551
00:45:01,578 --> 00:45:04,030
Scott: and then how could we not say everything we said about that news?

552
00:45:04,431 --> 00:45:06,259
Rym: Yeah, there was really and I could have gone on more.

553
00:45:06,339 --> 00:45:08,528
Rym: We kind of actually tried to push ourselves to stop.

554
00:45:08,568 --> 00:45:22,760
Rym: but it's If you ever wondered why we're atheists and why I really don't respect someone who believes that Noah's Ark was literal or that a man named Jesus really ascended into heaven or that there's a god who's going To send me to hell or that a lot.

555
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:25,630
Scott: I mean think about what that family is probably thinking right now.

556
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:28,900
Scott: They're probably thinking you know, oh our daughters in heaven.

557
00:45:28,981 --> 00:45:29,261
Scott: Isn't it?

558
00:45:29,322 --> 00:45:31,970
Scott: So great that you know, they're thinking it's great.

559
00:45:32,051 --> 00:45:44,904
Rym: They're probably when They're saying it's great that their daughter has reached the day of attainment that life wasn't a hoax a dreadful hoax It wasn't music and you weren't supposed to be singing.

560
00:45:45,467 --> 00:45:56,389
Scott: Yeah So you want to live in a society where you respect people who believe that it's okay to just not Take your kids to the doctor.

561
00:45:57,210 --> 00:46:02,502
Rym: And then uh, oh, yeah Yeah, I don't know we don't have much else to say.

562
00:46:02,522 --> 00:46:04,470
Rym: we there's no Thursday.

563
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:08,365
Rym: I look through the calendar that really fits after what we just talked about.

564
00:46:08,545 --> 00:46:10,272
Scott: No, this is unplanned Really?

565
00:46:10,292 --> 00:46:11,297
Scott: We sort of destroyed the.

566
00:46:11,639 --> 00:46:13,970
Scott: the Monty Python shall be pushed to next week.

567
00:46:14,291 --> 00:46:17,741
Rym: Yeah, at least I can say this the Monty Python show will happen next week.

568
00:46:17,882 --> 00:46:22,495
Scott: Yes, and we're probably gonna prepare lots of Bites for it and such.

569
00:46:23,437 --> 00:46:26,608
Rym: Oh well, so I Guess we'll just stop here.

570
00:46:26,628 --> 00:46:28,440
Scott: Do you just want to stop here?

571
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,045
Rym: Yeah, it's been about as long as a normal show.

572
00:46:30,086 --> 00:46:33,740
Rym: unless you have some other I mean I could reiterate my points again.

573
00:46:34,601 --> 00:46:35,804
Scott: Yeah, I guess we could.

574
00:46:35,844 --> 00:46:36,365
Scott: there's really.

575
00:46:36,385 --> 00:46:44,484
Rym: no I mean it's gotten to the point where I don't even have the will to argue much about Religion anymore.

576
00:46:44,524 --> 00:46:45,888
Scott: Yeah, I sort of like I just.

577
00:46:46,169 --> 00:46:59,780
Scott: it seems like when you're trying to get this through to a lot of people It's like they just don't think in The right, you know, they don't think properly they don't and it's it's pretty much impossible to get through to them.

578
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:00,945
Scott: And it's actually here.

579
00:47:00,965 --> 00:47:08,638
Scott: I got one more thing to say, you know the science-based medicine blog Which is like the best blog in the universe, you know, I'm gonna keep probably bring it up all the time.

580
00:47:08,699 --> 00:47:08,819
Scott: now.

581
00:47:09,565 --> 00:47:16,473
Scott: There's a great article About when impressive science fails to impress patients, right.

582
00:47:16,994 --> 00:47:20,813
Scott: and it says, you know doctors You know the way they think right is?

583
00:47:20,834 --> 00:47:28,580
Scott: they look at like You know a whole bunch of little tiny people's and like a big You know bowl and then they're not at the level of the people's they're way up high.

584
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:30,500
Scott: There was little people's in a bowl, you know.

585
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:42,200
Scott: And some of the people are exercising and some of the people are not exercising and they see that after an amount of time You know the not exercising people are you know dying off a lot faster than the exercising people, right?

586
00:47:42,521 --> 00:47:49,476
Scott: So they're like hi exercise is good But down on the level of the people right the people just looking to their left and to their right.

587
00:47:49,516 --> 00:47:51,803
Scott: the people are exercising and not Exercising right.

588
00:47:52,284 --> 00:47:58,427
Scott: one of the not exercising people looks to the right and they see an exercising person like break their hip You know exercising.

589
00:47:58,447 --> 00:48:00,300
Scott: they see another exercising person pull a muscle.

590
00:48:00,741 --> 00:48:07,380
Scott: They see another exercising person like die from overexerting themselves or you know, you know hurting themselves.

591
00:48:07,521 --> 00:48:09,628
Scott: Well, you know mountain climbing or something like that.

592
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:10,411
Scott: and they go.

593
00:48:10,492 --> 00:48:10,833
Scott: Oh hell.

594
00:48:10,873 --> 00:48:18,286
Scott: no and it scares them away, you know and they don't think in the same way and I don't know.

595
00:48:18,346 --> 00:48:19,777
Scott: It's it's like is there?

596
00:48:19,797 --> 00:48:21,726
Scott: I Really been questioning?

597
00:48:21,826 --> 00:48:26,660
Scott: if someone doesn't think in the wet in the right way Is it possible?

598
00:48:27,181 --> 00:48:30,355
Scott: You know just later in life to get them to think the right way?

599
00:48:30,516 --> 00:48:34,532
Scott: or you know People didn't think the right way originally didn't realize it.

600
00:48:34,572 --> 00:48:48,840
Rym: Well, I don't think we I mean instead of saying the right way I'll just say to having a illogical and rationally skeptical outlook on life or just Rationally evaluating the the evidence that has been presented to you in the world and making decisions based upon it.

601
00:48:49,643 --> 00:49:01,480
Rym: I mean, I've noticed that whenever I argue with someone about religion Almost never in my life has anyone made to me in an argument about religion a rational argument.

602
00:49:01,881 --> 00:49:04,047
Rym: I've never heard one in our forums.

603
00:49:04,368 --> 00:49:11,263
Scott: No one has even come close and they always just you know appeal to emotions or They.

604
00:49:11,303 --> 00:49:16,168
Rym: the worst thing is when I may like whenever there's an argument you see this all the time and even like one-to-one forget the forums.

605
00:49:16,189 --> 00:49:21,824
Rym: in my own life It seems like no one has ever answered any concern I have brought up.

606
00:49:22,105 --> 00:49:34,351
Rym: they simply bring up another one of their prone points and if I refute it, they just ignore that I refuted it and bring up another one of their points and They just that there's always something there's no end.

607
00:49:34,391 --> 00:49:36,880
Rym: There's no argument that would convince them.

608
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:39,860
Rym: There's no argument that we even get through to them or that they would even address.

609
00:49:40,523 --> 00:49:43,420
Scott: Yeah, it's like if I have a giant wall made of bricks.

610
00:49:43,781 --> 00:49:48,100
Scott: Right, and I see that they don't have a wall made of they don't have any bricks at all.

611
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:48,762
Scott: They've got nothing.

612
00:49:49,224 --> 00:49:50,649
Scott: So I say hey, you've got nothing.

613
00:49:51,291 --> 00:49:51,752
Scott: they say.

614
00:49:51,772 --> 00:49:52,796
Scott: Oh, but watch this.

615
00:49:52,836 --> 00:49:54,020
Scott: I'm gonna poke one of your bricks out.

616
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:54,904
Scott: I win I see you.

617
00:49:55,365 --> 00:49:58,759
Scott: So I'm like, I've still got all these other bricks here.

618
00:49:59,322 --> 00:50:01,413
Scott: They'd be like, ah, there's a hole in your brick wall.

619
00:50:01,433 --> 00:50:01,654
Scott: I'd like.

620
00:50:01,675 --> 00:50:02,660
Scott: you don't have anything.

621
00:50:03,243 --> 00:50:10,655
Scott: It's someone with nothing no leg to stand on, you know versus my mountain of bricks that maybe they can poke a whole few holes in.

622
00:50:10,675 --> 00:50:13,568
Scott: but then I patched them right up and They act like they've won.

623
00:50:13,588 --> 00:50:16,947
Scott: when they poked a tiny hole when they've got nothing I mean it just it's still.

624
00:50:17,108 --> 00:50:19,460
Rym: it harkens back to me to the day when I was in high school.

625
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,400
Rym: I might have told this on the show before but it's so relevant.

626
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:22,802
Rym: I was.

627
00:50:22,822 --> 00:50:25,577
Rym: I was sitting in an 11th grade or 12th grade.

628
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:27,568
Rym: I forget what grade it was, but it was.

629
00:50:27,609 --> 00:50:35,342
Rym: it was a class about world government and we're learning about the you know beliefs in sacred cows and The.

630
00:50:35,503 --> 00:50:38,340
Rym: a student raises their hand and you know ask like where does belief come from?

631
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:44,455
Rym: We start talking all about it and the secular origins of this belief which are actually clearly known through like it's.

632
00:50:44,756 --> 00:50:44,856
Rym: it's.

633
00:50:44,956 --> 00:50:51,217
Rym: it's ludicrously clear Like what pressures on society cause these beliefs to come into play.

634
00:50:51,257 --> 00:50:51,960
Rym: We know exactly.

635
00:50:53,020 --> 00:51:01,952
Rym: So she asks like after we learn all this you raises her hand again after a moment thought and asks Well, why doesn't someone just tell them that that's where their belief came from?

636
00:51:02,514 --> 00:51:13,374
Rym: and I point out that this girl was in fact a very Devoured Christian mmm, and I remember the teacher looked at her and he was a man I respected and he couldn't really get into the argument because there's

637
00:51:13,434 --> 00:51:15,440
Scott: a tea is a public school teacher and he get in trouble.

638
00:51:16,002 --> 00:51:18,731
Rym: But it was you could at that moment.

639
00:51:18,751 --> 00:51:38,458
Rym: You could look around the room and five or six people looked around the room and we all kind of met eyes with and there was this revelation of Well, we all understand the irony of this and the teacher met all of our eyes and he understood the irony of this and no one else in the room did.

640
00:51:38,478 --> 00:51:41,445
Rym: and That girl never.

641
00:51:41,946 --> 00:51:48,505
Rym: I don't want to get into all the stories of high school things since then but that girl never Changed or learns.

642
00:51:49,066 --> 00:51:50,030
Rym: Yeah, she was she.

643
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:53,180
Rym: I don't think she had the capacity to understand the irony of what she had just asked.

644
00:51:53,541 --> 00:52:02,455
Scott: Yeah, and what do you do in a world where you know, ethically and morally we have we've sort of you know All people are equal or should be treated equally.

645
00:52:02,476 --> 00:52:07,092
Rym: yet All people should be true in that or any bill.

646
00:52:07,172 --> 00:52:14,420
Rym: in terms of speech in terms of beliefs in terms of ideas Anyone is free to make whatever assertions they so desire.

647
00:52:14,921 --> 00:52:26,286
Rym: but at the same time as a human being they must be willing to deal with the fact that other human beings may make counter-assertions and that You do you're respected.

648
00:52:26,386 --> 00:52:30,216
Rym: everyone who is alive gets respect as a living being.

649
00:52:30,236 --> 00:52:35,259
Rym: they get respect as a human but that does not mean that they get respect as an intelligent human.

650
00:52:35,279 --> 00:52:47,320
Rym: and If someone believes in something crazy I still respect their rights and I respect that they exist and they can do whatever they want as long as they don't harm others But at the same time I cannot respect them.

651
00:52:47,781 --> 00:52:52,880
Rym: I cannot let things that they say that I disagree with or that I can prove wrong stand.

652
00:52:53,582 --> 00:52:54,886
Rym: I can't just look.

653
00:52:55,167 --> 00:53:03,130
Rym: it's like if you're in a restaurant and someone just stands up and starts yelling and screaming about how The steak that they're eating is actually full of cockroaches.

654
00:53:03,511 --> 00:53:05,677
Rym: and I look and it's a perfectly fine steak.

655
00:53:06,018 --> 00:53:07,945
Rym: and they keep yelling That is full of cockroaches.

656
00:53:08,387 --> 00:53:09,571
Rym: So I bite a piece.

657
00:53:09,591 --> 00:53:12,244
Rym: I take a piece and I eat it and I say look it's steak I'm eating it.

658
00:53:12,304 --> 00:53:12,949
Rym: It tastes like steak.

659
00:53:13,271 --> 00:53:14,480
Rym: I get ten other people to bite it.

660
00:53:14,742 --> 00:53:15,407
Rym: It tastes like steak.

661
00:53:15,448 --> 00:53:16,839
Rym: a scientist come in and says it's steak.

662
00:53:17,782 --> 00:53:23,860
Rym: I can't just let them continue to say without someone refuting it that it's actually cockroaches.

663
00:53:24,324 --> 00:53:33,940
Rym: that's such a Crime against logic for me to stand idly by when someone makes an unfounded and irrational assertion.

664
00:53:35,085 --> 00:53:51,127
Scott: I think the thing that bothers me most and has gotten me so, you know basically reinforce the idea in me that maybe some people are beyond helping is that You keep going back to the Flying Spaghetti Monster and Nobody ever.

665
00:53:51,147 --> 00:53:57,534
Scott: you just say Flying Spaghetti Monster Hello, and then no one ever says anything back to it at all.

666
00:53:57,555 --> 00:53:58,177
Scott: They just run it.

667
00:53:58,197 --> 00:53:59,220
Scott: They just do something else.

668
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:00,488
Scott: They don't no one ever.

669
00:54:00,891 --> 00:54:01,152
Scott: it's like.

670
00:54:01,172 --> 00:54:02,380
Scott: that's the end of the argument.

671
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,586
Scott: I mean the Flying Spaghetti Monster.

672
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:06,611
Scott: it there's no evidence for it.

673
00:54:06,992 --> 00:54:09,178
Rym: or by any of that arguments farms.

674
00:54:09,519 --> 00:54:16,560
Rym: I mean You're the classic argument that a lot of people have made to Christians that well, do you believe in Odin?

675
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:17,602
Rym: No, I do not.

676
00:54:17,783 --> 00:54:19,309
Rym: So you do not believe that Odin exists.

677
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:20,935
Rym: Nah, how about Thor?

678
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:22,120
Rym: How about Zeus?

679
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,247
Rym: How about Quetzalcoatl?

680
00:54:24,468 --> 00:54:27,100
Scott: How about wait, I do believe in Quetzalcoatl, but how about this?

681
00:54:28,103 --> 00:54:28,746
Rym: How about that?

682
00:54:29,229 --> 00:54:30,514
Rym: So so what do you believe in?

683
00:54:30,595 --> 00:54:31,660
Rym: and they'll say God?

684
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,246
Scott: How is that any different?

685
00:54:34,287 --> 00:54:36,537
Rym: Well that that's because the classic line is always.

686
00:54:36,557 --> 00:54:39,389
Rym: well It seems to me that we're both atheists.

687
00:54:40,032 --> 00:54:41,739
Rym: I just believe in one less God than you.

688
00:54:42,202 --> 00:54:44,032
Scott: Yeah, and no one ever.

689
00:54:44,052 --> 00:54:45,420
Scott: no one has anything to say to that.

690
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:51,080
Scott: I mean honestly, I want to have an argument where pretty much the other person is forced to reply to that.

691
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:57,340
Scott: I mean as opposed to going off on some other tangent about BS reply to that argument and that argument only.

692
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:03,740
Rym: I've never in my life read or heard and I've sought them out an answer that even begins to address that.

693
00:55:04,161 --> 00:55:05,226
Scott: Yeah, I mean what.

694
00:55:05,267 --> 00:55:08,120
Scott: how is you know, the Christian God more likely than Zeus.

695
00:55:08,362 --> 00:55:10,260
Scott: Well, a lot of people believe in the Christian God.

696
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:11,728
Scott: Well, a lot of people believed in Zeus.

697
00:55:11,949 --> 00:55:13,075
Scott: a lot of people believe in a lot.

698
00:55:13,095 --> 00:55:13,960
Scott: Yeah, that's an argument.

699
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:15,692
Scott: I'm ad populum next of course.

700
00:55:15,894 --> 00:55:16,740
Scott: I know there's a Bible.

701
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:20,092
Scott: There are a lot of books about Zeus and they're a lot older than the Bible next.

702
00:55:20,815 --> 00:55:28,060
Rym: It's a funny thing is I especially when I was reading a lot of Plutarch and I forget the exact passage.

703
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:38,800
Rym: I've been reading a lot of kind of first-hand historical text and there's nothing more fascinating to me than Reading a history book from ancient Rome about ancient Greece.

704
00:55:39,643 --> 00:55:48,155
Rym: That there's something special about that and the fact that like the ancient Greeks would study the ruins in Egypt and try to figure out what they were and it all.

705
00:55:48,416 --> 00:56:09,849
Rym: it's fascinating but there was a lot of talk about how the ancient Greeks were superstitious and the early Romans were superstitious and they believed in these silly things that we now know are silly and he talked Mentioned many times and there's a lot of evidence actually that a lot of the things that you know people say yes the Romans believed in Jupiter and Mars and all these things.

706
00:56:09,909 --> 00:56:20,390
Rym: but there's a lot of evidence that the state religions of well, I guess the overarching state religion and by the way, Rome was actually a Surprisingly and I say probably surprisingly.

707
00:56:20,471 --> 00:56:27,774
Rym: I mean one of the most tolerant ever Societies in terms of tolerating religion separate Christians to the lions and such.

708
00:56:28,115 --> 00:56:29,519
Rym: but a lot of that didn't happen.

709
00:56:31,042 --> 00:56:42,318
Rym: And also, I mean it's even more complicated than that the only reason the Jewish people were persecuted was that they resisted a kind of a false belief in that.

710
00:56:42,942 --> 00:56:57,047
Rym: Generally from what I've read the Roman state religion was not a religion in that Very few Romans if any truly and actually believed like well Jupiter's up there and he's gonna kick my ass Yeah, they're all they were all.

711
00:56:57,087 --> 00:57:08,731
Rym: you know, hail Caesar they weren't hail Jupiter Mars like Swearing the oath to the religion or swearing the fealty or any of those things Was not so much an exercise in believing in the Roman God.

712
00:57:08,771 --> 00:57:09,594
Rym: They couldn't care less.

713
00:57:10,056 --> 00:57:18,887
Rym: It was an exercise in Acknowledging Roman culture and acknowledging that you are now a part of this large overarching Centralized world.

714
00:57:19,411 --> 00:57:20,780
Scott: it was more of a symbolic thing.

715
00:57:21,363 --> 00:57:27,640
Scott: Jupiter wasn't treated the same way that say, you know The Christian God or Jesus is treated and I was treated more the same way.

716
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:38,809
Rym: We treat like the statue of justice at the courthouse and I read time and time or like Paul Bunyan Yeah, or Johnny Appleseed Yep but I read time and time again that the Romans were more.

717
00:57:39,110 --> 00:57:40,033
Rym: they were puzzled that.

718
00:57:40,414 --> 00:57:43,783
Rym: why do these people not accept this simple gesture?

719
00:57:43,823 --> 00:57:50,629
Rym: they actually believe in this other weird thing and It also didn't help that the Jews were revolting.

720
00:57:51,716 --> 00:57:56,319
Rym: Yeah, it's pretty much There's a classic joke and you didn't jump on it.

721
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:59,288
Scott: Well, I know that but what are they up to now?

722
00:57:59,468 --> 00:58:02,536
Rym: Yeah It's a classic joke.

723
00:58:02,637 --> 00:58:04,244
Scott: Yeah, I know and I'm not a fan.

724
00:58:04,365 --> 00:58:05,430
Scott: I never thought that joke was funny.

725
00:58:05,570 --> 00:58:05,952
Rym: I don't know.

726
00:58:06,373 --> 00:58:08,479
Rym: I find it funny only if it's done in a silly voice.

727
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:08,961
Scott: Yeah.

728
00:58:09,141 --> 00:58:12,712
Scott: Yeah, but yeah, it's like they were mostly Persecuted.

729
00:58:12,753 --> 00:58:15,481
Scott: not because we don't like you you believe some crazy thing.

730
00:58:15,521 --> 00:58:16,123
Scott: It was mostly.

731
00:58:16,143 --> 00:58:18,230
Scott: you're revolting and causing trouble.

732
00:58:19,313 --> 00:58:20,708
Scott: So stop causing trouble.

733
00:58:23,111 --> 00:58:30,558
Scott: yeah, and it just like you know, these parents cause trouble and Crusades cause trouble and fake medicine causes trouble.

734
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:32,564
Rym: Ah the Crusades.

735
00:58:32,805 --> 00:58:33,788
Scott: Yeah, are we done?

Rym: I think we're done.
