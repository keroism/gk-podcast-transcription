00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,681
Rym: It's Tuesday April 25th 2017.

2
00:00:12,681 --> 00:00:13,122
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,402 --> 00:00:15,827
Rym: okay, and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:16,428 --> 00:00:19,967
Rym: the grizzled a cooperative World War one.

5
00:00:20,067 --> 00:00:22,329
Rym: misery game the cards.

6
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:23,238
Scott: misery game is a.

7
00:00:25,864 --> 00:00:26,898
Rym: Let's do this.

8
00:00:28,622 --> 00:00:32,798
Rym: so it's Tuesday, and I know you nerds want us to talk about video games and we will.

9
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:41,704
Rym: but Hockey is a game and the Rangers have made it to a second round And the most.

10
00:00:42,186 --> 00:00:57,001
Rym: the most fascinating and wonderful thing that's happened in hockey right now is I'm sad that the Leafs didn't knock the caps out because that would have been funny, but the fact that the Predators Swept the Blackhawks is Just.

11
00:00:57,101 --> 00:01:02,720
Rym: I still can't get over how funny I find that and I kind of hope the Predators push it all the way to the.

12
00:01:02,924 --> 00:01:05,768
Rym: now I'm kind of rooting for them over there.

13
00:01:05,829 --> 00:01:06,713
Rym: cuz who cares?

14
00:01:06,753 --> 00:01:09,963
Rym: what happens over there like About the Blues?

15
00:01:10,344 --> 00:01:11,809
Rym: care about the Blues the Oilers.

16
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,092
Scott: No nobody can.

17
00:01:13,293 --> 00:01:14,617
Rym: yeah someone cares.

18
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:15,559
Rym: at least one person cares.

19
00:01:16,162 --> 00:01:19,059
Rym: Mm-hmm sure you're pretty low energy today.

20
00:01:19,843 --> 00:01:20,688
Scott: What's going on?

21
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:21,693
Scott: It's a sad day.

22
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:24,963
Rym: It's not that sad It's just miserable.

23
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:35,290
Rym: outside and dark and cold and rainy and windy I Literally I was sitting at my desk like thinking to myself.

24
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:35,872
Rym: I was having that.

25
00:01:36,032 --> 00:01:44,646
Rym: what I was thinking was could I Sneak into one of the conference rooms and just take like a nap What anyone notice.

26
00:01:45,067 --> 00:01:45,870
Rym: and I'm thinking that.

27
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:49,866
Rym: and then Scott messaged me, and he's just like I'm so tired I almost fell asleep at my desk.

28
00:01:50,168 --> 00:01:51,413
Scott: I did almost fall asleep my days.

29
00:01:51,876 --> 00:01:52,599
Rym: It's that kind of day.

30
00:01:53,702 --> 00:01:55,559
Rym: So you got any news other than hockey?

31
00:01:56,639 --> 00:02:00,248
Rym: Uh News yeah, there's like seven people watching now.

32
00:02:00,288 --> 00:02:01,873
Scott: sad seven sad seven people.

33
00:02:01,893 --> 00:02:06,623
Rym: okay one of them is pooping though the What do you got?

34
00:02:07,486 --> 00:02:11,398
Scott: oh so Mario Kart 8 deluxe for a switch comes out like this week.

35
00:02:11,518 --> 00:02:13,688
Scott: ish Yeah, it's gonna be 50 or 60 bucks.

36
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:14,613
Scott: Which is a lot of money.

37
00:02:14,754 --> 00:02:16,843
Rym: I thought for a minute last week I was like oh shit.

38
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:17,908
Rym: I should pre-order that.

39
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:20,779
Rym: and then I remembered that I'm just buying everything digital shop.

40
00:02:21,322 --> 00:02:22,085
Scott: I'm just gonna buy it.

41
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:24,676
Rym: No buy it on Amazon and it all.

42
00:02:24,776 --> 00:02:35,132
Rym: it basically Automatically through your Nintendo account activates it and downloads it on your switch without you having to do anything And you get the Amazon discount from the Amazon credit card.

43
00:02:35,292 --> 00:02:41,821
Scott: okay, so it just makes the game cheaper, so This is a re-release of the Wii U Mario Kart Mario Kart 8.

44
00:02:41,821 --> 00:02:49,379
Scott: It's not any different, but the one notable thing is that unlike the original Mario Kart 8 for Wii U this Mario Kart?

45
00:02:50,082 --> 00:02:52,594
Scott: Everything is just fucking unlocked as soon as you turn the game on.

46
00:02:52,614 --> 00:02:53,960
Scott: you don't to unlock all this bullshit.

47
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:59,188
Scott: Thank you Jesus, and it has some extra characters and stuff I think they added like Splatoon characters and stuff.

48
00:02:59,309 --> 00:02:59,790
Rym: what I mean?

49
00:02:59,951 --> 00:03:01,576
Rym: you might remember we did our grind panel.

50
00:03:01,676 --> 00:03:04,144
Rym: I have this whole Segment about.

51
00:03:04,445 --> 00:03:09,280
Rym: look at all the grindy shit you have to do in Mario Kart games to unlock basic functionality.

52
00:03:11,081 --> 00:03:14,433
Rym: I wish super Bomberman R. Would take a page from that.

53
00:03:14,814 --> 00:03:18,730
Scott: yeah, so Bomberman R They made it up a patch to it.

54
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,320
Scott: I haven't tried it since the patch came out.

55
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:20,979
Scott: I think like today.

56
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:29,180
Scott: Maybe the patch came out where they increased the frame rate to 60 FPS Which is great because it was sort of having problems with frame rate when we played it right?

57
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,800
Rym: It was hard to tell because I we some of it was internet lag.

58
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,100
Rym: Yeah, we were playing it online with our man.

59
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:38,053
Scott: I definitely noticed it being slightly imprecise compared to other Bomberman's.

60
00:03:38,214 --> 00:03:38,675
Scott: so I'm.

61
00:03:38,936 --> 00:03:39,518
Scott: I've heard the 60 FPS.

62
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,874
Scott: This you know cleans it up, but to do that they cut the resolution cuz.

63
00:03:43,894 --> 00:03:45,380
Scott: hey look the switch ain't that powerful.

64
00:03:45,741 --> 00:03:46,945
Scott: Yeah, but then again.

65
00:03:46,985 --> 00:03:47,748
Scott: It's like wait a minute.

66
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:49,533
Scott: This is just fucking Bomberman.

67
00:03:49,674 --> 00:03:51,500
Scott: You can play fucking Zelda on this thing.

68
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,248
Scott: Why is no Bomberman a problem?

69
00:03:53,308 --> 00:03:53,690
Scott: I don't know.

70
00:03:53,790 --> 00:04:02,728
Rym: I mean I get a frame stutter occasionally in Zelda But it's usually in like really grassy areas with a bunch of little guys Mm-hmm, but I get them pretty reliably.

71
00:04:02,749 --> 00:04:07,853
Rym: There's a few places the map or a beetle pretty much Always stutter if I look around at all.

72
00:04:07,953 --> 00:04:10,920
Scott: I think if they work harder on the code They could probably optimize it more.

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,600
Rym: But I feel like it doesn't matter that much though because how much resolution needed for Bomberman?

74
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,503
Scott: Can you see the bombs?

75
00:04:15,523 --> 00:04:21,786
Rym: good you only need high-res for Bomberman if you're gonna have giant map options Which this game clearly does not know.

76
00:04:21,826 --> 00:04:23,050
Scott: it's not Bomberman high-ten.

77
00:04:23,271 --> 00:04:26,140
Scott: Nah, which is the first HD video game as far as I'm aware.

78
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:42,519
Rym: So uh yeah, I'm actually really excited about this Mario Kart because I'm pretty sure my favorite Bomberman That's modern because I know you're what you're about to say is the one on the 3ds, but Mario Kart 8 Like the one that we used to play.

79
00:04:44,907 --> 00:04:49,839
Scott: Oh the GameCube one N64 was an N64 or a GameCube one that we liked a lot.

80
00:04:50,061 --> 00:04:51,353
Rym: I don't think we like the N64 one that much.

81
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,235
Scott: I think it was a GameCube one that had a crappy single-player as most Bomberman's do.

82
00:04:56,275 --> 00:04:57,480
Scott: yeah Bomberman's yeah.

83
00:04:57,862 --> 00:04:59,991
Rym: No, I'm talking about Mario Kart Mario Kart.

84
00:05:00,011 --> 00:05:01,880
Scott: Yeah, the best Mario Kart is a GBA one.

85
00:05:02,181 --> 00:05:04,594
Rym: Yeah, yeah, and I was trying to have it off because that's not modern.

86
00:05:04,654 --> 00:05:05,720
Rym: the most the modern one.

87
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,606
Scott: It's not modern about it.

88
00:05:06,647 --> 00:05:08,520
Scott: It was the second Mario Kart game ever.

89
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,913
Rym: I actually prefer the 3ds one.

90
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,109
Scott: That's kind of crazy to think about right?

91
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:15,088
Scott: the first Mario Kart game was this oh No is the third Mario Kart game.

92
00:05:15,108 --> 00:05:16,597
Rym: first Mario Kart was on the Super Nintendo.

93
00:05:16,638 --> 00:05:20,230
Scott: right then I don't know if Mario Kart 64 came out first or the.

94
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:25,990
Scott: I think the Mario Kart 64 came out next was the second Mario Kart And that the GBA one was the third one.

95
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,400
Scott: Super Circuit, but Super Circuit is still the best Mario Kart.

96
00:05:28,681 --> 00:05:29,826
Rym: Yeah, I don't know.

97
00:05:29,927 --> 00:05:32,700
Rym: I actually really like Mario Kart 8, but I've never owned it.

98
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:56,579
Rym: I've played it at other people's houses because I wasn't dumb enough to buy a Wii U. But now that I can get Mario Kart 8 Deluxe with everything unlocked on the switch I really just feel bad for the people who bought it on the Wii U because you probably still haven't unlocked everything Most every time I've played that game at someone's house

99
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,800
Scott: But I'm the only reason I'm thinking maybe not is that I've had many Mario Karts with unlocking.

100
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:06,384
Scott: I had the Wii one right for example and that had unlocking and I had the GBA one that Unlocking right.

101
00:06:06,786 --> 00:06:10,885
Scott: and every time I had a Mario Kart where things needed to be unlocked I unlocked them all.

102
00:06:11,266 --> 00:06:14,938
Scott: so I assume if I had the Wii U one I would be able to unlock them all.

103
00:06:15,219 --> 00:06:16,501
Rym: I mean Yeah, but I don't know I mean.

104
00:06:16,681 --> 00:06:22,832
Rym: the only Mario Kart I've ever fully unlocked myself was the 3ds one because I would just play it everywhere like all the Time.

105
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:25,890
Rym: yeah No every single player problem with it was no one ever play with.

106
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:32,098
Scott: but that's the reason I'm gonna buy this Mario Kart 8 is Because even if people don't come over to my house and play it or anything, right?

107
00:06:33,262 --> 00:06:40,451
Scott: Every Mario Kart I've ever owned I have played and beaten all the single-player cups on 5100 150 and I think this one is 200 CC.

108
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,625
Rym: Yeah, it does.

109
00:06:42,826 --> 00:06:50,231
Scott: and every single course first place Alright and every single course, so I feel like if I did that in all those Mario Karts I'm gonna do it on this one too.

110
00:06:50,251 --> 00:06:55,574
Rym: on the 3ds one I went further and went after the ghosts real hard on the GBA one at.

111
00:06:55,614 --> 00:06:59,543
Scott: my ghosts if they're still in there are Perhaps unbeatable.

112
00:06:59,603 --> 00:07:03,840
Rym: dude in the era of snaking I made some fucking snake ghosts.

113
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:06,814
Scott: Well, this was in a no snake real skill Mario Kart.

114
00:07:07,055 --> 00:07:08,060
Rym: Hey snaking was a skill.

115
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,832
Rym: It was just a very painful and annoying one, but it was a skill.

116
00:07:10,852 --> 00:07:14,307
Rym: Yeah, if you don't think it's a skill It's race you want to play?

117
00:07:14,327 --> 00:07:17,500
Scott: Yeah, let's play GBA Mario Kart the real Mario Kart and see who wins.

118
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,129
Rym: Let's play let's let's do a tournament of every Mario Kart.

119
00:07:20,249 --> 00:07:21,393
Rym: He's the best overall.

120
00:07:21,754 --> 00:07:23,339
Rym: That's the entire Mario Kart.

121
00:07:24,381 --> 00:07:25,265
Rym: That's not a bad idea.

122
00:07:25,305 --> 00:07:26,290
Scott: I'm saying it's not shabby.

123
00:07:26,611 --> 00:07:27,415
Scott: Yeah, that's pretty good.

124
00:07:27,475 --> 00:07:28,580
Rym: That'd be a good livestream event.

125
00:07:29,501 --> 00:07:30,264
Scott: That's pretty good.

126
00:07:30,285 --> 00:07:33,680
Rym: We just got to get emulators set up for all the odd Mario Kart.

127
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,130
Scott: I think we could probably manage to get a copy of every kind of Mario.

128
00:07:36,311 --> 00:07:40,449
Rym: Yeah, I don't have a working Super Nintendo physically Though we could just emulate that one.

129
00:07:40,609 --> 00:07:41,473
Rym: Yeah, I don't have an n64.

130
00:07:41,493 --> 00:07:42,136
Rym: emulate that too.

131
00:07:43,141 --> 00:07:44,505
Rym: Yeah, those emulators aren't great though.

132
00:07:44,726 --> 00:07:48,056
Scott: Also Mario Kart 64 people might hate me on this is the worst one.

133
00:07:48,076 --> 00:07:48,819
Rym: I agree.

134
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:56,759
Scott: You might think that the ones with the ones that are broken with snaking are not as broken and stupid as that n64.

135
00:07:57,622 --> 00:07:59,329
Rym: Yep, plus if you didn't snake.

136
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:03,427
Rym: the ones with snaking were actually super great In a lot of ways.

137
00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:12,659
Rym: the Super Nintendo one while it is bad It also gets bonus points for the fact that it was the first one and that it did a lot with the Super Nintendo and the mode 7 graphics.

138
00:08:14,682 --> 00:08:17,817
Rym: So in some other news you guys probably are familiar with g2a.

139
00:08:18,905 --> 00:08:20,420
Rym: We've talked about them on the show occasion.

140
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:25,640
Scott: If you've never heard of g2a, they're like a sponsor of lots of streamers and that's like how people know about them.

141
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,768
Scott: Yeah, but they are bad dudes.

142
00:08:28,788 --> 00:08:29,490
Rym: Yeah, they're.

143
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,876
Scott: you should not patronize g2a.

144
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:35,046
Scott: I Un-endorsed them.

145
00:08:35,066 --> 00:08:37,918
Scott: Yeah, do not give them monies or use their website.

146
00:08:37,938 --> 00:08:40,044
Rym: official Anti-endorsement.

147
00:08:40,265 --> 00:08:43,013
Scott: Yes official we were not paid to anti-endorse them.

148
00:08:43,094 --> 00:08:51,278
Rym: now basically now that there's problems ideology Ideologically with what they do, but there's also problems ideologically with having problems with what if you don't know what g2a is.

149
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:59,980
Scott: It's a website where if you have keys for games and you don't want to you don't want those games you want to sell them You can go there and sell your keys.

150
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:10,267
Scott: You can also if you want to buy a game You can go there and find someone selling a game key and you can probably get the game cheaper than it would be on steam Or anywhere else and you know what in principle.

151
00:09:10,287 --> 00:09:12,374
Scott: I think that's totally okay.

152
00:09:12,394 --> 00:09:16,056
Rym: Well in principle it is pure market arbitrage.

153
00:09:16,665 --> 00:09:18,963
Rym: Just right if I but usually Badges right.

154
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:25,452
Scott: if I buy a humble bundle and there's a game in there that I already have a copy of and none of my friends Want it and I can't give it away to anyone.

155
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,698
Scott: I'll put it on g2a.

156
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,349
Scott: I'll sell it for like a dollar and it's like.

157
00:09:29,811 --> 00:09:30,514
Scott: what's wrong with that?

158
00:09:30,594 --> 00:09:30,915
Scott: Nothing.

159
00:09:31,016 --> 00:09:32,080
Scott: I think nothing is wrong with that.

160
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,500
Rym: However, nothing's wrong with that except in the general context of the way the world actually works.

161
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:41,560
Scott: Oh, whatever, but that hurts publishers, but it favors gamers, which I think is fine.

162
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:47,720
Rym: Ideally it hurts publishers in the same way that libraries hurt novelists exactly, right?

163
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:59,956
Scott: But you know, they think it hurts them a lot, but g2a does something else which very much does hurt Everybody and that is just allow criminal activity to happen on their service.

164
00:10:00,036 --> 00:10:01,400
Rym: So it's a bunch of different levels.

165
00:10:01,461 --> 00:10:09,520
Rym: so one of the things that often happens is CD keys will be cheaper in a place where the currency is worth less and they will arbitrage that.

166
00:10:10,123 --> 00:10:13,460
Scott: So someone will buy a shit ton of Russian keys and sell them somewhere else.

167
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,767
Rym: yep, they'll also.

168
00:10:14,787 --> 00:10:24,662
Rym: there have been a bunch of stories of people just fraudulently hitting API's or otherwise getting keys that the publisher never got money for and just Selling them.

169
00:10:25,063 --> 00:10:28,473
Rym: Yep, and like the rabbit hole goes you can read up like is it?

170
00:10:28,513 --> 00:10:30,439
Scott: you can sell any game key on g2a.

171
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:37,444
Scott: So what if you find a way to get a game key that works but no one ever paid for that game key to the actual Game-maker person?

172
00:10:37,464 --> 00:10:43,800
Rym: they also extort as far as I can tell from these articles game publishers in that they will sell your keys.

173
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:51,340
Rym: Anyway, they'll only give you a tiny cut if you sign up into their platform and let them be legit with your game.

174
00:10:51,742 --> 00:10:57,830
Rym: But if you say fuck you, you know, we don't want to do business with you They'll keep selling your keys and they won't give you a cut.

175
00:10:58,191 --> 00:10:59,195
Scott: they do all they do.

176
00:10:59,235 --> 00:11:02,232
Scott: things like they have fraud protection But you got to pay for it.

177
00:11:02,252 --> 00:11:07,314
Scott: Yeah, it's just like wait You're gonna just basically allow illegal activity unless you pay you to stop allowing it.

178
00:11:07,595 --> 00:11:09,059
Scott: shouldn't that just be a thing that you do?

179
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:13,270
Scott: So you can read that Maybe like Gmail like making you pay for the spam filter.

180
00:11:13,391 --> 00:11:15,860
Rym: the news isn't that they exist and are shady.

181
00:11:16,001 --> 00:11:18,209
Rym: You can type that into Google and you're gonna see that.

182
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:26,644
Rym: the news is that they were at a large game conference recently and they had a panel and the panel looks like you had to keep in mind this panel was coming hot off the Heels of.

183
00:11:26,744 --> 00:11:29,416
Scott: I think that they were doing some sort of thing with.

184
00:11:29,577 --> 00:11:30,180
Scott: is a gearbox?

185
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,827
Scott: Maybe I think is gearbox.

186
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:36,852
Scott: and then there was a backlash on gearbox Like what the fuck you do with those g2a guys.

187
00:11:36,973 --> 00:11:38,120
Scott: and here I was like, you know what?

188
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,690
Scott: We're not doing nothing with those piece of shit g2a guys.

189
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:42,598
Scott: Yeah, you know we demand g2a.

190
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,506
Scott: We demand you do all these things.

191
00:11:44,566 --> 00:11:45,389
Scott: Otherwise, fuck you.

192
00:11:45,449 --> 00:11:48,220
Scott: and g2a was like no, so they're like well fuck you then.

193
00:11:48,401 --> 00:11:49,525
Scott: so then they have their man.

194
00:11:49,565 --> 00:12:01,840
Rym: this panel shows up right after that is in the news and they Stupidly Like I feel like at this point people who are at the center of controversy where they are probably at fault.

195
00:12:02,463 --> 00:12:11,200
Rym: There's like a playbook of how to not make it worse And I feel like a lot of these people have never read that playbook because they open it up to audience questions.

196
00:12:13,226 --> 00:12:15,132
Scott: If you're getting berated why would I mean?

197
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:17,740
Scott: we don't take audience questions and we're usually getting applauded.

198
00:12:18,203 --> 00:12:20,380
Scott: If I'm getting berated, why would I take questions?

199
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:25,239
Rym: I mean the president of our country currently doesn't take questions because he knows that would be a shit show.

200
00:12:25,821 --> 00:12:31,580
Rym: But one of those only smart things he does they uh, they took questions and you can read what happened.

201
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:46,160
Rym: but basically as far as I can tell the entire audience was nothing but pissed off game developers and game publishers and They surprised the g2a hasn't just like just been law suited out of existence or jailed out of existence.

202
00:12:46,902 --> 00:12:54,320
Rym: As soon as you're on the international stage like that like it gets kind of tricky to actually go after companies like this I don't actually know where they're based legally.

203
00:12:54,661 --> 00:12:59,156
Scott: I'm surprised that like for example, there are certain things that I'm surprised haven't happened.

204
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:05,856
Scott: For example, why hasn't Amazon slash twitch banned all twitch people who are sponsored by g2a?

205
00:13:05,976 --> 00:13:14,820
Rym: well because You can't hurt the ecosystem of how the twitch streamers make money because if the streamers stop working twitch stops working.

206
00:13:15,242 --> 00:13:18,860
Scott: I'm just saying like, you know, there are people who aren't sponsored by g2a on twitch, right?

207
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:22,149
Scott: You could let you know just say hey, no g2a is allowed.

208
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:25,720
Scott: Yeah, you know that does also set up any other sponsor is fine.

209
00:13:25,961 --> 00:13:35,820
Rym: There is a big line that can get you into get you into tricky situations If you start having taking editorial control of things that you've previously claimed are open and are automated.

210
00:13:36,223 --> 00:13:46,370
Rym: That's the reason why I like a lot of social media platforms Won't just ban Nazis because then they might get sued by other people who say hey if you can ban this kind of content You need to ban this other kind of content.

211
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,220
Rym: That might be illegal in my jurisdiction.

212
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:55,130
Rym: So there's a lot of reasons why people like to just not take a stance Independent of if that's right, that's the reason.

213
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,680
Rym: but anyway, you can read this article.

214
00:13:58,001 --> 00:14:03,100
Rym: There's some video there that this panel did not go well for them and it's pretty funny.

215
00:14:03,861 --> 00:14:12,755
Scott: So there's that fig thing right which is like the Kickstarter, but you actually are investing in the game somehow Kickstarter for equity the way it were actually, you know, do you know how it works?

216
00:14:12,795 --> 00:14:13,720
Rym: I can explain really briefly.

217
00:14:14,282 --> 00:14:21,484
Rym: You know, this is the rare time when my knowledge of video games and my knowledge of capital market Is it actually combined?

218
00:14:21,504 --> 00:14:26,240
Scott: There's actually some sort of organization that's allowed to invest and they invest and you're buying a piece of it.

219
00:14:26,381 --> 00:14:28,120
Rym: No, no, no, no, so it's actually way better.

220
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:31,030
Rym: So there was a the I think was the JOBS Act under Obama.

221
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:42,090
Rym: a thing that it did is that previously There are certain kinds of things you are not legally allowed to invest in unless you are a so-called Accredited investor.

222
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:42,980
Scott: that means rich person.

223
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:56,097
Rym: Right accredited investor means that you either meet some other specific requirements or generally you have a net worth Personally of more than 1 million dollars not counting the house you live in so rich person.

224
00:14:56,157 --> 00:14:59,024
Rym: Yeah the rationale Rather or not.

225
00:14:59,084 --> 00:14:59,707
Scott: I'm not by.

226
00:14:59,908 --> 00:15:01,536
Scott: oh wait, does it count houses?

227
00:15:01,577 --> 00:15:02,139
Scott: I don't live in.

228
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,880
Rym: Yes, if you own a bunch of houses that counts.

229
00:15:03,981 --> 00:15:10,380
Scott: So if I bought say a beach house and I wasn't renting it It was just my beach house that would count because I'm only living it in like three months a year.

230
00:15:10,662 --> 00:15:16,796
Rym: Yeah, you could totally use that as part of your you know Getting up to the million dollars, but the house that I'm actually living in nine months of the air.

231
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:16,996
Scott: No good.

232
00:15:17,057 --> 00:15:20,692
Rym: No good Okay, because you can't you just live in an expensive house.

233
00:15:20,933 --> 00:15:22,460
Rym: You can't be like, yeah, I'm a millionaire.

234
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,691
Rym: No, your house is worth a million dollars.

235
00:15:24,732 --> 00:15:25,639
Rym: What if I live in whatever?

236
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,213
Scott: I live in seven houses each of them one day of the week.

237
00:15:28,515 --> 00:15:29,199
Rym: I don't know.

238
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:30,424
Rym: I also take.

239
00:15:30,565 --> 00:15:34,560
Rym: I'm not going to express any opinion on whether or not that is a good regulation.

240
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,063
Rym: But that was.

241
00:15:35,123 --> 00:15:36,390
Rym: that's the thing it is.

242
00:15:37,073 --> 00:15:38,300
Scott: I mean there should be some sir.

243
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,948
Scott: I mean, it's essentially regardless of the details.

244
00:15:41,068 --> 00:15:44,920
Scott: There should be some sort of rule saying who's allowed to invest and who's not.

245
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:49,815
Scott: Otherwise you get scams going around tricking old ladies into investing in things and stealing all their money.

246
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:51,921
Rym: It's the producers situation Exactly.

247
00:15:51,941 --> 00:15:59,925
Rym: They're trying to prevent people who have who stand to lose their entire livelihood from investing in Complicated things.

248
00:16:00,187 --> 00:16:02,296
Rym: so you can buy stock without being an accredited investor.

249
00:16:02,356 --> 00:16:03,432
Scott: It's not very complicated Yeah.

250
00:16:03,781 --> 00:16:26,060
Rym: Because then also because there's a lot of protections around like what stock is and all these sorts of things and but like Putting money into private equity like just buying a chunk of a company That is so much riskier than even people who think they understand it realize that the government basically said no No No You got to already be rich or you cannot play in this field because this field is full of literal minds.

251
00:16:26,743 --> 00:16:30,980
Rym: And I can say that because the dictionary says that literal now literally means figuratively, but I digress.

252
00:16:31,642 --> 00:16:47,699
Rym: So the JOBS Act a part of it basically allowed for the concept of crowdsourced investing meaning you basically need an Accredited investor to negotiate the terms of the specific investment and I believe themselves invest in it.

253
00:16:48,321 --> 00:17:00,000
Rym: But then legally any number of other people who are not accredited investors are allowed to invest Directly as long as they have the exact same terms as the accredited investor.

254
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:04,993
Rym: So one person who ostensibly knows what they're doing Made an investment.

255
00:17:05,055 --> 00:17:05,640
Scott: I have anyway.

256
00:17:05,881 --> 00:17:09,310
Scott: So the actual news here is that fig has done a bunch of things using this method.

257
00:17:09,692 --> 00:17:16,875
Scott: the current one though is a new Xcom ish game from the person who made original Xcom.

258
00:17:16,915 --> 00:17:18,300
Rym: that's kind of a big deal.

259
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,775
Scott: So the there is a newer Xcom game, right?

260
00:17:20,795 --> 00:17:21,480
Scott: That's not bad.

261
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:25,277
Rym: It's a great game that I don't like but I don't have anything I can really fault with it.

262
00:17:25,317 --> 00:17:34,062
Scott: It's a good game But it's you know that those games were not made by the people who made the original Xcom just the same publisher Whatever right?

263
00:17:34,122 --> 00:17:53,217
Scott: It's not you know, so now it's like oh here finally after a bunch of Xcom clones and actual games with the Xcom License we have a game not called Xcom But basically is an Xcom game from the Xcom creators themselves the same peoples who made Xcom back in the day.

264
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:58,520
Rym: now It's interesting because the things that it's kind of like with Team Fortress 2 like before.

265
00:17:59,022 --> 00:18:10,200
Rym: The things that made the new Xcom the legit one way better as a game Were the things that made me less interested in it because I kind of enjoyed the weird fiddly bullshit of the old game.

266
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:14,280
Rym: So when I heard there was new Xcom coming, I kind of wanted the old fiddly bullshit.

267
00:18:15,102 --> 00:18:17,770
Rym: I wonder if this game will be the old fiddly bullshit.

268
00:18:17,831 --> 00:18:22,445
Rym: And if so, I wonder if anyone would like it except People like me.

269
00:18:22,705 --> 00:18:23,729
Scott: screenshots look too good.

270
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,073
Rym: Yeah, we'll see.

271
00:18:25,293 --> 00:18:26,056
Rym: We'll see how this goes.

272
00:18:26,076 --> 00:18:29,832
Rym: I Haven't actually looked into any of the details yet.

273
00:18:30,173 --> 00:18:32,360
Rym: So I don't know.

274
00:18:32,822 --> 00:18:33,424
Rym: Remember that panel.

275
00:18:33,444 --> 00:18:35,892
Rym: we did a PAX way back in like 2009 or 2010 where we were like.

276
00:18:38,441 --> 00:18:45,700
Rym: There's a bunch of egregiously obvious things that no one in games has ever done and this was like the third to last slide.

277
00:18:46,061 --> 00:18:47,628
Rym: Why doesn't someone remake Xcom?

278
00:18:47,688 --> 00:18:49,154
Rym: and now it's happened twice?

279
00:18:49,214 --> 00:18:50,740
Scott: apparently it's happened a lot more than twice.

280
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,030
Rym: Yeah It happened twice for real.

281
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:59,160
Scott: since we did there have been many many resurrections of dead games like Descent has been.

282
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,915
Scott: Specifically there are quite a few Xcoms out there.

283
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:04,880
Scott: You're just not looking at up.

284
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:10,035
Rym: We also wanted the giant massive Star Wars battle game and they actually made that to like.

285
00:19:10,335 --> 00:19:20,106
Rym: so everything we wanted got mostly made but anyway things Of the day.

286
00:19:20,146 --> 00:19:21,432
Rym: What do you got?

287
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:22,900
Scott: So it's just like a one-minute video.

288
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:30,766
Scott: These fine people are in a restaurant of some kind and they get chicken and a burrito Which I could really go for.

289
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:37,114
Scott: I'll take chicken and a burrito right now and they are just so happy That chicken and burrito they cannot contain.

290
00:19:37,154 --> 00:19:41,349
Scott: the dance the dance bus out Maybe and there's some commentary on the dance.

291
00:19:41,409 --> 00:19:45,089
Scott: That is quite excellent and it's just one of those videos I just make.

292
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:50,399
Scott: it's only a minute long But there's people in it just being happy and when you watch it you'd be happy too.

293
00:19:51,262 --> 00:19:52,808
Scott: Is the best kind of internet video.

294
00:19:52,928 --> 00:20:00,580
Rym: it grows and grows almost like one of those like continuous take music videos We're like, it's zoomed in on the food item and moves up a little bit.

295
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,583
Rym: You see the happy guy.

296
00:20:01,603 --> 00:20:03,249
Rym: it's more and more happy.

297
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:05,777
Scott: and the camera times you spent describing this video.

298
00:20:05,797 --> 00:20:06,660
Scott: They could have watched the video.

299
00:20:06,701 --> 00:20:07,980
Scott: It's 50 something seconds long.

300
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,632
Rym: But the moment when you see the people way in the back in the kitchen Reacting to this that's the moment wise if you want to feel good.

301
00:20:14,893 --> 00:20:22,723
Rym: his 50 something seconds of video 56 seconds of hit the log, baby Gotta be.

302
00:20:22,783 --> 00:20:23,967
Rym: yeah, this is good stuff here.

303
00:20:24,709 --> 00:20:26,234
Rym: So, uh, this is the thing.

304
00:20:26,254 --> 00:20:34,144
Rym: I've been saving for a while, but There was a game that I played a lot when I when I was in like Middle school

305
00:20:34,164 --> 00:20:37,123
Scott: because it was the game that was on the computers in your middle school Yep,

306
00:20:37,525 --> 00:20:43,340
Rym: and it was not just my middle school, but also my high school Independently, I found the community for it there.

307
00:20:43,761 --> 00:20:50,842
Rym: But you know, this is so long ago that this was a game where I literally didn't really understand the concept of piracy in Middle school.

308
00:20:51,303 --> 00:21:00,111
Rym: so like one day someone just handed me this floppy disk and said here You should check this out and I put it into the computer and there were.

309
00:21:00,151 --> 00:21:03,080
Rym: there was stunts 40 racing and la checks.

310
00:21:03,661 --> 00:21:13,129
Scott: So this game fit on a one point four four megabyte three and a half inch floppy disk with room to spare To save the custom courses.

311
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:18,027
Rym: this game was so far ahead of its time That it is shocking.

312
00:21:18,087 --> 00:21:23,666
Scott: You can't even fit a fucking mp3 on that disc One song.

313
00:21:23,707 --> 00:21:30,780
Scott: you ain't even getting one song on there, dude You can barely fit a modern word document on a but you fit this whole goddamn game on there.

314
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,250
Scott: You probably couldn't fit a website on their stunts.

315
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:46,100
Rym: 40. racing was a fully 3d Like legit racing game with giant maps and it had a full map editor That is way more comprehensive than you're imagining.

316
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:58,165
Rym: so this game ended up just getting installed on literally every computer in my middle school and People would pass around floppy disks with their high scores on custom tracks They'd made.

317
00:21:58,508 --> 00:22:03,537
Rym: and there was this like weird Trade like there was a currency and some street cred in yo.

318
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:09,780
Rym: I get a good time on Steve's custom crazy map with the branching paths and we'd like pass it around.

319
00:22:10,284 --> 00:22:23,444
Rym: This game was a shockingly big part of my life And my thing of the day is this article that will basically explain to you the history of this game and how that community legit existed all Over America.

320
00:22:24,086 --> 00:22:30,388
Rym: in fact all over the world and in fact the community of people who are obsessed with this game Persists to this day.

321
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:31,914
Scott: There's a lot of games like I mean tech.

322
00:22:31,935 --> 00:22:34,120
Scott: people still play tech mobile same same deal.

323
00:22:34,981 --> 00:22:35,904
Rym: So this game.

324
00:22:36,286 --> 00:22:36,948
Scott: look at how much?

325
00:22:37,069 --> 00:22:38,494
Scott: how did the hell do they fit all that?

326
00:22:38,574 --> 00:22:40,260
Scott: and one point four four megabytes?

327
00:22:40,781 --> 00:22:43,142
Rym: Yeah in what 1990?

328
00:22:43,142 --> 00:22:44,582
Scott: Jesus Christ Like.

329
00:22:44,802 --> 00:22:46,629
Rym: look like you could just make custom maps now.

330
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:50,000
Rym: the game even had a bunch of logic to make sure the maps were legit.

331
00:22:50,482 --> 00:22:58,479
Rym: Like it wouldn't let you make broken maps, but some people even hacked it and messed with it so you could make broken maps so you could then do some interesting stuff.

332
00:22:58,499 --> 00:23:01,206
Rym: and Yeah, you should just read this article.

333
00:23:01,226 --> 00:23:02,169
Rym: this is ultra fascinating.

334
00:23:02,852 --> 00:23:05,160
Rym: the other interesting thing is I couldn't find a screenshot of this.

335
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:05,744
Rym: I'm curious.

336
00:23:06,147 --> 00:23:07,073
Rym: I wanted some help out there.

337
00:23:07,093 --> 00:23:08,040
Scott: It could be a false memory.

338
00:23:08,381 --> 00:23:10,066
Rym: No, no, no, this is a legit memory.

339
00:23:10,327 --> 00:23:14,600
Rym: the game had copy protection in it like games did in the era.

340
00:23:15,265 --> 00:23:22,460
Rym: But basically in southeast, Michigan Every copy of the game that I ever encountered was cracked pre cracked.

341
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:25,570
Rym: So you did not have to do the copy protection thing.

342
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:26,413
Rym: the game just worked.

343
00:23:26,774 --> 00:23:28,760
Rym: Mmm, and it put up a splash screen.

344
00:23:29,243 --> 00:23:33,062
Scott: When you started the game it fit that splash screen in the 1.4.

345
00:23:33,062 --> 00:23:41,892
Rym: That said cracked by killa fits because that was the organization or the person I never knew because you know back then there wasn't really an internet.

346
00:23:42,073 --> 00:23:43,579
Scott: kill fit them the evil cracker.

347
00:23:43,780 --> 00:24:02,440
Rym: yeah, like this person was a legend in my middle school because they just made the cracked version of the game and it was on the same floppy disk that had LHX and a cracked version of Scorched earth that had the triple tank without having to pay money in the meta moment.

348
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:19,737
Scott: The booklet book is Frank Herbert's dune But don't bother read it yet because we're not gonna read it until we both beat Ganondorf on Twitter today by sheer coincidence I saw a tweet that contained a poster for dune drawn by rio ichi ikigami, oh That was pretty good.

349
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:26,333
Scott: Crying Fremen, perhaps I I favorited that tweet *laughter*.

350
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:32,180
Rym: This weekend Saturday and Sunday and Friday night, I guess but I won't be doing any panels.

351
00:24:32,661 --> 00:24:43,569
Rym: I will be at Zenkai Con doing grinding mechanics and game design for an anime openers a best of edition of that and Flip the table rage quitting in games.

352
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:50,460
Rym: So if you're gonna be if you live anywhere in I don't know West Eastern Pennsylvania, you should go to this con.

353
00:24:50,702 --> 00:24:55,520
Rym: I would not fly to go to Zenkai Con But if I lived within driving distance, I would definitely be there.

354
00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:01,379
Rym: It's a pretty legit con and when I'm not doing panels pretty much just gonna be playing tabletop games.

355
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,383
Scott: I'm not going there.

356
00:25:04,403 --> 00:25:05,326
Rym: Yeah, you're not.

357
00:25:05,627 --> 00:25:05,808
Scott: Nope.

358
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:08,055
Rym: It might be nice weather this weekend though.

359
00:25:08,115 --> 00:25:08,937
Rym: I might have to.

360
00:25:09,178 --> 00:25:09,760
Scott: that's a shame.

361
00:25:09,921 --> 00:25:13,304
Scott: Yeah, I guess I'm glad I didn't agree to go to Pennsylvania.

362
00:25:13,324 --> 00:25:16,077
Rym: I guess I can go for a long run in Pennsylvania.

363
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:18,985
Rym: There's nothing wrong with that.

364
00:25:19,307 --> 00:25:20,613
Rym: I mean, it's just a forest.

365
00:25:20,653 --> 00:25:21,980
Rym: I guess it's not actually in Philly.

366
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:26,280
Scott: Mm-hmm, of course Scott, we're gonna show her the Amish people.

367
00:25:26,741 --> 00:25:35,532
Rym: we're gonna be going to Pennsylvania later this year because there is in fact a new packs and We're gonna be at it.

368
00:25:36,561 --> 00:25:40,697
Scott: You uh, we got to make you know, I mean they put a packs in the worst possible place.

369
00:25:41,179 --> 00:25:42,985
Scott: So we Were as possible.

370
00:25:43,025 --> 00:25:44,229
Scott: We have to go and save it.

371
00:25:44,269 --> 00:25:47,580
Scott: What is what place on earth is worse than Philadelphia place?

372
00:25:48,504 --> 00:25:50,740
Rym: Besides Eritrea North Jersey.

373
00:25:51,582 --> 00:25:59,160
Scott: No, I would rather if I were sorry Jersey for all the shittiness actually has quite a bunch of nerds there.

374
00:25:59,421 --> 00:26:04,620
Scott: So does Pennsylvania, but I would rather those are Pennsylvania nerds and not Jersey.

375
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:16,240
Rym: If I were forced to live in Philly or in I don't know most of North North Jersey I would actually choose Philly but I would not be a Phillies fan or a Flyers fan.

376
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,044
Scott: Why would you do?

377
00:26:17,427 --> 00:26:19,478
Rym: I would basically never follow sports again.

378
00:26:20,322 --> 00:26:27,692
Rym: But the New York is a legit for real packs But it's tabletop only done today.

379
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:34,170
Rym: That's a big deal for us Because 99% of what we do at PAX is tabletop.

380
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:38,020
Rym: So this is like if you're like us, this is just packs distilled.

381
00:26:39,202 --> 00:26:40,045
Rym: It's like a mainline.

382
00:26:40,085 --> 00:26:43,896
Rym: It's the heroine of PAX is Other things.

383
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:50,967
Scott: you should check out our channels on YouTube Twitter Facebook Instagram not streaming a lot of stuff.

384
00:26:51,128 --> 00:26:56,304
Scott: I'm streaming You know, we got channels and also having trouble finding them.

385
00:26:56,324 --> 00:26:57,870
Scott: It's not hard people.

386
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:01,523
Scott: We got websites and we you know, you can find it if you want to.

387
00:27:01,543 --> 00:27:04,794
Rym: and also we are live streaming Most of the GeekNights episodes.

388
00:27:04,814 --> 00:27:05,838
Scott: Yeah, don't watch that though.

389
00:27:06,099 --> 00:27:08,970
Rym: So there are 18 people watching this right now.

390
00:27:09,231 --> 00:27:10,896
Scott: Two minutes 18 too many people.

391
00:27:11,036 --> 00:27:15,430
Rym: one of them is watching it while they're pooping which that's a better thing to do.

392
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:16,840
Scott: There's 17 and a half people.

393
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:22,349
Rym: Yeah But yeah, we do live stream and the show and other things.

394
00:27:22,369 --> 00:27:31,884
Rym: and the only other announcement I have that a lot of you been bugging me about I Still am like I've got the pipeline for new antenna episodes worked out simultaneously.

395
00:27:31,904 --> 00:27:41,390
Rym: I've been hit with a ton more Copyright takedown notices and most of them are from the anime companies and they're block notices not just monetization.

396
00:27:41,572 --> 00:27:47,080
Rym: so if That keeps being a pain in the ass I am just gonna kill the you tennis show because I'm not gonna deal with that crap.

397
00:27:47,402 --> 00:27:52,201
Rym: half of radio free equestria is already taken Down and I've lost the appeals and I'm just giving up on that shit.

398
00:27:52,321 --> 00:27:54,630
Scott: So no, you just got to click the final button.

399
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:55,297
Scott: This is sue me.

400
00:27:55,722 --> 00:27:59,704
Rym: No Unless you and I sign a contract splitting our liability.

401
00:27:59,724 --> 00:28:05,081
Rym: No, we'll just Legally only I am liable because it's my youtube channel.

402
00:28:05,161 --> 00:28:13,010
Rym: Let's just make an anonymous YouTube channel and Actually anonymous YouTube channels are kind of a pain for a lot of reasons and they'll just get the same DMS.

403
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:15,264
Scott: They take down notices and then we say yes sue me deal with it.

404
00:28:15,525 --> 00:28:16,250
Rym: Ah, you can't do that.

405
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,596
Rym: Let's give legit contact info.

406
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:20,430
Scott: Why don't we call these companies up and like, you know talk to them?

407
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:24,685
Rym: Yeah, we could try to call King Records is actually one of the most reasonable ones.

408
00:28:24,705 --> 00:28:27,264
Rym: They pretty much are like, oh, yeah Sorry, dude fair use every time.

409
00:28:28,272 --> 00:28:36,442
Scott: Why don't we you know, we could settle we don't need to you know, we everyone everyone gets hit by copyright stuff Right, and then they always like the company comes up to them.

410
00:28:36,462 --> 00:28:37,828
Scott: It's like look we're not gonna sue you.

411
00:28:37,868 --> 00:28:38,270
Scott: Let's settle.

412
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:43,409
Scott: Why don't we go to them and say like look we won't drag you into the obvious fair use if you settle with us.

413
00:28:43,711 --> 00:28:45,748
Rym: Yeah, the problem is because fair use is such a garbage.

414
00:28:45,768 --> 00:28:48,823
Rym: Preston It's not actually obvious and it's playing Russian roulette.

415
00:28:49,084 --> 00:28:51,596
Rym: if you go into court with that stuff We don't we're not going to court.

416
00:28:51,616 --> 00:28:53,946
Scott: We're saying we're just sort of threatening to go to court.

417
00:28:54,368 --> 00:28:57,521
Scott: Yeah We're saying, you know, hey settle with us.

418
00:28:57,541 --> 00:28:58,485
Scott: this is fair use.

419
00:28:58,525 --> 00:28:59,770
Scott: Are you sure you want to come after us?

420
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:01,758
Scott: Look, just let our videos be where it's not like.

421
00:29:01,838 --> 00:29:11,753
Rym: I feel like that's only a threat if we also say also We're both super rich and we have a lawyer on retainer and we actually have to have a legit lawyer on retainer Who sends that letter.

422
00:29:11,894 --> 00:29:15,885
Scott: couldn't we also just not put clips from actual antenna in the thing?

423
00:29:16,266 --> 00:29:19,757
Rym: I feel like that really Minimizes the usefulness of the show.

424
00:29:19,777 --> 00:29:21,485
Scott: Did we just distribute it on bit torrent?

425
00:29:21,686 --> 00:29:22,430
Rym: That's a pain in the ass.

426
00:29:22,531 --> 00:29:23,963
Rym: Don't want to bother I could.

427
00:29:24,024 --> 00:29:24,790
Scott: it's not a pain in the ass.

428
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:25,192
Scott: I'll do that.

429
00:29:25,633 --> 00:29:29,528
Rym: Yeah, but it all said then we have no idea if anyone even watches it at all.

430
00:29:29,668 --> 00:29:30,110
Scott: Who cares?

431
00:29:30,594 --> 00:29:31,521
Rym: Oh, yeah, I don't know.

432
00:29:31,823 --> 00:29:35,390
Rym: you can make the show yourself If it's if I'm not putting on my youtube pretty much not bothering.

433
00:29:36,112 --> 00:29:37,427
Scott: See, this is what I'm talking about.

434
00:29:37,467 --> 00:29:41,130
Scott: people Right rims always telling you to watch because he's only doing this for his ego.

435
00:29:41,231 --> 00:29:41,452
Rym: I'm.

436
00:29:41,573 --> 00:29:43,630
Scott: I do pretty much everything in my life for my ego.

437
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:44,774
Scott: I'm just making stuff.

438
00:29:44,794 --> 00:29:51,390
Scott: cuz I like making stuff and I don't care if you watch and because I know the stuff we make sucks I'm telling you not to watch, you know who to trust.

439
00:29:52,473 --> 00:29:54,049
Rym: I'm very open in my motivations.

440
00:29:55,391 --> 00:29:58,222
Scott: You my Rym doesn't actually care if you're happy or entertained or whatever.

441
00:29:58,282 --> 00:30:02,293
Scott: He just wants, you know to Upon him.

442
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:03,979
Rym: I assume if you're consuming anything.

443
00:30:04,059 --> 00:30:06,830
Scott: I actually care about your well-being and that's why I say don't watch.

444
00:30:07,073 --> 00:30:15,830
Rym: I pretty much assume Either you are entertained for some reason or you've got an angle and you're about to sue us and you're just gathering information.

445
00:30:16,213 --> 00:30:17,888
Rym: It's one of those two things anyway.

446
00:30:18,523 --> 00:30:34,863
Rym: Anyway so good friend Matt came over the other day and he introduced us to a game that I had never seen or heard of me either and he described it as it is co-op in the way that Hanabi is as opposed to the bad way.

447
00:30:34,883 --> 00:30:39,008
Rym: and It's World War one themed.

448
00:30:39,531 --> 00:30:49,796
Rym: yeah, World War one themed and the art is by the Charlie Hebdo guy who was very tragically murdered by terrorists not that long ago and I like that guy's art style.

449
00:30:50,097 --> 00:30:51,302
Rym: So everything combined.

450
00:30:51,322 --> 00:30:53,349
Rym: This is pretty much a must-play game.

451
00:30:53,972 --> 00:30:54,454
Scott: Yeah, I mean that's.

452
00:30:54,495 --> 00:30:57,066
Scott: so we like you didn't know that person ever did art like when they.

453
00:30:57,227 --> 00:30:59,155
Scott: he mentioned that I'm just like what which guy?

454
00:30:59,195 --> 00:31:02,890
Scott: and I'm like really that I did art for a board card game.

455
00:31:03,011 --> 00:31:04,037
Rym: You look at the world.

456
00:31:04,077 --> 00:31:04,661
Rym: Look at this art.

457
00:31:04,681 --> 00:31:08,969
Rym: You're like, oh, yeah, obviously Yeah, and the art is great like this game.

458
00:31:09,371 --> 00:31:17,792
Rym: But if if nothing else if we said nothing about the mechanics the theme and style is just perfect Mm-hmm.

459
00:31:18,534 --> 00:31:26,643
Rym: So there aren't that many World War one games that aren't just horrible like war glorification Simulators of very specific battles that old grognards.

460
00:31:26,704 --> 00:31:28,150
Rym: Yeah, usually what I mean, we have one.

461
00:31:28,351 --> 00:31:30,178
Rym: We have that one that we've never actually played.

462
00:31:30,219 --> 00:31:30,761
Rym: We've read the rules.

463
00:31:30,801 --> 00:31:31,865
Scott: that a civil war game.

464
00:31:32,327 --> 00:31:32,548
Rym: What?

465
00:31:32,689 --> 00:31:36,402
Rym: No That's a. that's literally like the Verdun battle stuff that game.

466
00:31:36,422 --> 00:31:36,803
Rym: We've got.

467
00:31:36,823 --> 00:31:36,883
Rym: Hmm.

468
00:31:37,626 --> 00:31:38,790
Rym: We just we've never played it.

469
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:39,334
Rym: Maybe we should.

470
00:31:39,354 --> 00:31:41,370
Rym: we could do a live stream of us playing that grognard game.

471
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:50,218
Rym: Anyway, but the gist of this game is that you are all a bunch of World War one soldiers But the game is not about fighting the war.

472
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:53,929
Rym: The game is about not dying until peace breaks out.

473
00:31:54,432 --> 00:31:57,990
Scott: Your only goal is a much more accurate World War one simulator.

474
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:02,770
Rym: Yeah, so it's a co-op game and it has like pretty good information economy.

475
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:13,022
Rym: But basically challenges come up and you have got to keep making sacrifices until eventually either you die Or peace breaks out.

476
00:32:13,324 --> 00:32:13,888
Rym: and that's it.

477
00:32:15,151 --> 00:32:29,341
Rym: It's a really good game and it is one of the rare co-op games that involves process parsing information and intentions from other people Without having any of that fiddly shadows over Camelot.

478
00:32:29,802 --> 00:32:33,372
Rym: I am three sure that we can make it through the battle Mm-hmm.

479
00:32:33,753 --> 00:32:43,350
Rym: So the way it works is essentially you'll have you'll each get a character and each character has like a minor power and You have a deck and the deck is two decks.

480
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:51,326
Rym: You have a deck of challenges and if you get to the bottom of that deck There's a peace symbol because if you see the peace symbol you've survived the war.

481
00:32:51,366 --> 00:32:52,470
Rym: you get to go home to your families.

482
00:32:53,393 --> 00:32:54,929
Rym: There's another deck of bullshit.

483
00:32:55,452 --> 00:32:58,041
Rym: they're the same cards the deck of bad things.

484
00:32:58,683 --> 00:33:09,109
Rym: as you fail at tasks or accrue tasks that you didn't deal with you keep drawing from the bad deck and Adding to the deck that's covering up the piece.

485
00:33:10,151 --> 00:33:11,739
Rym: So the more you keep failing.

486
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:25,325
Rym: you're trying to run out that piece deck to see peace But as you mess up Cards just keep coming on top of that deck making it harder and harder and harder and if you run out the bad deck It's just a picture of death at the end and you all die and it's game over.

487
00:33:25,345 --> 00:33:30,269
Rym: Mmm, so Essentially, you have a hand of cards and you're trying to get rid of cards.

488
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:32,850
Scott: Yep, you want to you don't like cards in your hand?

489
00:33:32,971 --> 00:33:34,729
Rym: Yep, you just want to get them out of your hands.

490
00:33:35,211 --> 00:33:38,743
Rym: but every card you play out of your hand goes into a public area.

491
00:33:39,244 --> 00:33:46,490
Rym: and in that public area if Too many of one thing up here and there's a lot of things three strikes are out.

492
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:48,909
Scott: So it's like if there are three snows.

493
00:33:49,451 --> 00:33:52,238
Scott: Right, there's environments and there's obstacles like it.

494
00:33:52,278 --> 00:33:58,779
Scott: There's three bullet shells or whatever you lose if there's three whistles Which are raids.

495
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,430
Rym: I guess whistles are raids.

496
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:03,562
Rym: Shells are like artillery barrages, right?

497
00:34:03,602 --> 00:34:05,030
Rym: Yes is obviously gas.

498
00:34:05,311 --> 00:34:07,199
Scott: It's like if there's three of anything you lose.

499
00:34:07,239 --> 00:34:07,882
Scott: and cards.

500
00:34:08,344 --> 00:34:15,250
Scott: some of the cards only have one thing But most of the cards have at least two and some of them way more than some of the cards are just bad.

501
00:34:16,132 --> 00:34:17,902
Scott: There was a card that it all three things on.

502
00:34:17,983 --> 00:34:19,070
Rym: Yeah, it was just the worst.

503
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:21,164
Scott: There's a card with like two weathers and a thing on.

504
00:34:21,224 --> 00:34:22,090
Scott: it's like he's right.

505
00:34:22,391 --> 00:34:34,357
Scott: So it's like on your turn you play a card and you add it to the tableau and now it's like, okay Well now there are two cards out there with snow and two cards out there with bullets and the next guy look at his Hand and every single card has snow in it.

506
00:34:34,637 --> 00:34:35,179
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

507
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:45,630
Rym: well, I have to play a card on my turn or Now you can talk and coordinate but the very specific rules are you cannot talk about anything in your hand.

508
00:34:46,192 --> 00:34:49,043
Rym: You cannot share what you've got in your hand at all.

509
00:34:49,304 --> 00:34:49,565
Scott: Yep.

510
00:34:49,786 --> 00:34:54,129
Rym: It's pretty clear Yep, and there's another action of like doing the support thing.

511
00:34:54,531 --> 00:34:58,550
Rym: When you play the support thing, you cannot say what you played.

512
00:34:59,352 --> 00:35:01,640
Rym: Other people might be able to infer it from other actions you've taken.

513
00:35:01,901 --> 00:35:05,260
Rym: but you cannot actually say I'm pointing it left or I'm pointing It right.

514
00:35:05,485 --> 00:35:13,933
Rym: Yep So on your turn you'll either play a card from your hand and as long as you don't hit three of one of the bad things Then it's good.

515
00:35:13,993 --> 00:35:15,638
Rym: just continues and you're trying to get rid of.

516
00:35:15,658 --> 00:35:19,150
Scott: more people can play more cards now or you can withdraw.

517
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:20,210
Rym: Mmm.

518
00:35:20,331 --> 00:35:22,720
Rym: withdrawing means you don't play any more cards.

519
00:35:23,061 --> 00:35:26,435
Rym: Everyone else keeps going around, but you're safe You don't have to do anything else.

520
00:35:26,455 --> 00:35:28,504
Scott: You're you're gonna still have cards in your hand.

521
00:35:28,785 --> 00:35:29,870
Scott: It's less than perfect, right?

522
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:33,040
Scott: Ideally you would withdraw after playing your entire hand of cards.

523
00:35:33,081 --> 00:35:34,064
Scott: We were never able to do that.

524
00:35:34,245 --> 00:35:35,450
Scott: Yep, except maybe round one.

525
00:35:35,912 --> 00:35:44,704
Rym: So the way they turn the way the game actually is structured is there'll be a team leader and the team leader Essentially makes a bid like how big a task are we gonna go after?

526
00:35:44,745 --> 00:35:46,290
Scott: how many cards are we gonna start with in our?

527
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:52,310
Scott: Yep, and then you're gonna draw to make a higher number because if you go through more rounds the game is much harder.

528
00:35:52,351 --> 00:35:53,609
Scott: You want to beat the game in less?

529
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:58,188
Scott: rounds gonna play more cards and fewer rounds in order to be able to win if you do it like to.

530
00:35:58,248 --> 00:36:02,668
Scott: if you do a Little little rounds with just a few cards each each around will be easier to deal with.

531
00:36:02,749 --> 00:36:07,150
Scott: sure but every round you're getting more cards in the evil deck and it's just like

532
00:36:08,471 --> 00:36:08,732
Rym: Yep,

533
00:36:09,153 --> 00:36:12,305
Scott: you have to pull off like a round of you know, five six cards something like

534
00:36:12,325 --> 00:36:15,169
Rym: you gotta be very tactile about it Like if you had a few bad rounds in a row.

535
00:36:15,551 --> 00:36:31,790
Rym: you got to take on a really easy challenge to try to clear the decks because the more cards you have in your hand when You all finally withdraw because you keep going till everyone's out of cards or everyone withdraws All the cards you've got in your hands contribute to how many more bad things you put on top of that piece.

536
00:36:32,092 --> 00:36:34,310
Rym: Just pushing piece further and further away.

537
00:36:34,812 --> 00:36:38,929
Rym: It is very difficult to express until you actually play the game because the mechanics are so novel.

538
00:36:39,633 --> 00:36:42,990
Rym: How well it simulates the feeling of sinking into mud.

539
00:36:43,331 --> 00:36:48,210
Rym: It sucks you are trying to crawl out of this pit and mud just keeps sliding in.

540
00:36:48,652 --> 00:36:49,377
Rym: Everything you do.

541
00:36:49,397 --> 00:36:54,126
Scott: worse is when it's your turn and like you're so smart You're like how we're gonna survive everything cuz we're so smart.

542
00:36:54,186 --> 00:36:54,750
Scott: It gets your turn.

543
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:56,286
Scott: It's like well, I have to just kill us.

544
00:36:56,346 --> 00:36:56,831
Scott: this round There's.

545
00:36:56,851 --> 00:36:57,114
Scott: no I have.

546
00:36:57,134 --> 00:36:58,607
Scott: no I have to play a card and they all kill us.

547
00:36:58,728 --> 00:37:03,886
Rym: Yep Especially when so even worse some of the cards you play they don't add anything to the center.

548
00:37:03,906 --> 00:37:04,910
Scott: They just change the rules.

549
00:37:05,131 --> 00:37:12,884
Scott: Yeah by restricting you even further like oh, yeah, by the way You can't withdraw unless you caught your hand has two or less cards in it.

550
00:37:12,925 --> 00:37:19,149
Scott: It's just like yeah Or by the way withdrawn, but I have three cards now I had to play one of them and they all kill us.

551
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:23,270
Rym: Yep, and or like by the way, you have a phobia against gas now.

552
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:26,642
Rym: So gas attacks always have a plus one out there forever.

553
00:37:26,723 --> 00:37:28,148
Rym: So two more gases and you're done.

554
00:37:28,389 --> 00:37:34,228
Scott: Yeah It's like instead of two three strikes you're out for gas is two strikes You're out for gas and the other guys got a handful of gas.

555
00:37:34,309 --> 00:37:38,916
Rym: Yep Oh and if you get too many of those phobias You're dead and the game's over and everybody loses.

556
00:37:39,177 --> 00:37:43,028
Rym: the whole squad has to survive the war or you immediately lose.

557
00:37:43,449 --> 00:37:43,650
Scott: Yeah.

558
00:37:44,712 --> 00:37:55,409
Rym: So there's a couple other minor mechanics in that when you withdraw There's these support tokens and they point left or right and you basically secretly decide Who you're going to support on your way out.

559
00:37:55,550 --> 00:38:04,070
Scott: So if a majority of these are pointing at the same player that player Can like sort of clean up some of those evil rules that they have on them like their gas phobia or whatever.

560
00:38:04,993 --> 00:38:11,090
Rym: Or they can recharge their good-luck charm and then you pass the ones you used to that player to the player you pointed at.

561
00:38:11,591 --> 00:38:15,926
Rym: But if there is no player who got them who got the most?

562
00:38:15,946 --> 00:38:17,371
Rym: the plurality of those Right.

563
00:38:17,391 --> 00:38:23,306
Scott: So if each play if you're playing with four people and like one person has two and one person has two No one gets anything.

564
00:38:23,407 --> 00:38:27,983
Scott: Yep I'm not allowed to communicate this in advance at all.

565
00:38:28,384 --> 00:38:32,977
Scott: So you just sort of have to Majority of people have to support the same person.

566
00:38:33,098 --> 00:38:44,735
Rym: Yep, knowingly every character has one sort of cloverleaf like a good-luck Blow it power where you can blow this power once and get out of a tricky situation Like you don't have to play a card.

567
00:38:44,976 --> 00:38:46,865
Rym: You can remove a card from play.

568
00:38:46,905 --> 00:38:48,010
Rym: like you can blow it once.

569
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:49,354
Rym: There's a way to get it back.

570
00:38:49,415 --> 00:38:50,840
Rym: But essentially it's like a one-time.

571
00:38:51,261 --> 00:38:51,723
Rym: Oh crap.

572
00:38:51,783 --> 00:38:53,569
Rym: I was lucky that time, but I'm okay for now.

573
00:38:54,692 --> 00:39:12,690
Rym: and there's also a pretty nice mechanic of there's these speeches and Every one of them is like literally a speech bubble from a comic that has the first sentence of the kind of speech that you imagine like a Corporal would give to his troops in World War one when they're trying to hunker down and survive an artillery barrage.

574
00:39:12,991 --> 00:39:14,598
Rym: Mm-hmm, and you got to give the speech.

575
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:17,309
Rym: you give a short speech and then you can help one of your friends out.

576
00:39:17,971 --> 00:39:29,486
Scott: But at the same time we played we wanted to use these and we kept getting some sort of restriction like sorry Can't use those up and it's just like we used them like maybe once and I feel like we could.

577
00:39:29,527 --> 00:39:30,733
Scott: we came really close to Winning.

578
00:39:30,794 --> 00:39:31,482
Scott: I feel like so close.

579
00:39:32,312 --> 00:39:37,570
Scott: We could have won with just a few more of those But we were restricted and weren't allowed to use them by some other cards.

580
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:45,347
Rym: Well, like one of the phobias is you become mute Which is pretty great because the rule that was definitely one of the most fun things.

581
00:39:45,447 --> 00:39:52,042
Scott: and it you think And I first saw that I thought it was gonna be stupid Like we didn't play test this at all, but actually it was fun.

582
00:39:52,082 --> 00:39:52,524
Scott: It worked out.

583
00:39:52,564 --> 00:39:56,637
Rym: Well, it was fun and it was also Crippling to our ability to coordinate.

584
00:39:56,757 --> 00:40:00,550
Scott: Yeah, it's like yeah, you can't tell anyone within your hand, but you're still communicating a whole bunch.

585
00:40:00,691 --> 00:40:06,668
Scott: Yep, right, but it's like yeah, not only can you not give speeches cuz you're mute and you can't talk But you're mute and you can't talk.

586
00:40:07,392 --> 00:40:12,414
Rym: so the actual experience of the game like in terms of how it actually breaks down because you can be like you can find the Rules and read it.

587
00:40:12,434 --> 00:40:20,950
Rym: I highly recommend you just get it and play it because it's good But what you're basically gonna find is that the game is this very delicate balance of trying to figure out.

588
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:38,370
Rym: Each of you has some information But no one has the full picture and you argue with each other to decide how much of a challenge to take Knowing that you need to take more challenges in order to survive But at the same time taking a challenge bigger than you could actually deal with could be disastrous.

589
00:40:38,832 --> 00:40:42,104
Rym: Mm-hmm, and it really just has I wonder she.

590
00:40:42,265 --> 00:40:43,610
Scott: I guess that obviously wouldn't work.

591
00:40:43,751 --> 00:40:45,621
Scott: We just picked like some enormous number like 10.

592
00:40:45,621 --> 00:40:53,045
Rym: Yeah, just do the whole deck Alright, so unless we clear it the whole deck in that one go which mathematically is impossible.

593
00:40:53,085 --> 00:40:54,629
Rym: I believe I believe it is.

594
00:40:55,391 --> 00:41:02,010
Rym: Then great we withdraw and then we get Joe we draw the entire rest of the bad deck and death breaks out instead of peace.

595
00:41:02,451 --> 00:41:14,550
Rym: Right, but I just really appreciate this is such a good example of a game that Perfectly melds the theme of the game and the mechanics of the game.

596
00:41:14,711 --> 00:41:18,290
Scott: You could I mean this game is so like doesn't have a lot of components.

597
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:21,220
Scott: You could have easily put some any theme it on this right?

598
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:29,849
Scott: It could have been like, you know, oh You know surviving pretty much anywhere or anything where there's some sort of pressure and you need to sort of.

599
00:41:29,869 --> 00:41:39,810
Scott: you know Get through right like y'all, you know, it could have been some sort of trek like get across the jungle Game about a data center and each of you is in charge of a server, right?

600
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:40,997
Scott: You can't have three heats.

601
00:41:41,298 --> 00:41:43,330
Scott: You can't have three losses of power.

602
00:41:43,912 --> 00:41:46,620
Scott: Three our hard drive crash hacker, right?

603
00:41:47,142 --> 00:41:48,767
Scott: It's like pretty much any situation.

604
00:41:48,787 --> 00:41:52,780
Scott: you could apply this to anything But the World War one works really well.

605
00:41:53,391 --> 00:42:06,710
Rym: But yeah, but but and just so perfectly mechanically but - it is very interesting to me to see a game That is about war that is not about fighting the war and not about winning the war.

606
00:42:07,172 --> 00:42:10,670
Rym: You literally do not like you do not give a shit how the war is going.

607
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:15,104
Scott: It's also very rare to see a game with a war theme that is co-op.

608
00:42:15,144 --> 00:42:16,549
Scott: That's not just team versus co-op.

609
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:19,881
Scott: Yeah, actually a hundred percent co-op war.

610
00:42:20,061 --> 00:42:22,570
Rym: and where the theme is just we're in this together.

611
00:42:23,331 --> 00:42:34,350
Scott: War is hell right because like most of the war books and war movies that I experience in my life are You know that like, you know just shows the suffering of war, right?

612
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:38,470
Scott: You know just one side and how shitty war is and war is the worst, right?

613
00:42:39,893 --> 00:42:43,010
Scott: And it's not about fighting necessarily all the time, right?

614
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:52,541
Scott: But when you look at games the games of war are always, you know much more in line of you know glorifying Combat and such.

615
00:42:52,642 --> 00:42:55,717
Scott: Yep, right And about winning and losing.

616
00:42:55,737 --> 00:42:57,804
Scott: I mean the reality of war.

617
00:42:57,904 --> 00:43:02,784
Rym: it literally doesn't even matter What side of the war these soldiers are on right?

618
00:43:02,865 --> 00:43:13,058
Scott: I'd like to see More games both video and tabletop, you know that are about war is bad The same way that movies and books are about war is bad.

619
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:16,267
Scott: Like, you know, Johnny got your gun or whatever, right?

620
00:43:16,287 --> 00:43:23,549
Scott: Yep as a Unless games that are about war let's win and kill everybody.

621
00:43:24,252 --> 00:43:27,225
Rym: I mean, this is basically all quiet on the Western Front the game.

622
00:43:27,466 --> 00:43:34,390
Rym: Yep, just And it feel you know, it feels very like you throw down a gas card and it's like ah gas attack.

623
00:43:34,471 --> 00:43:35,537
Rym: We just got to make it through.

624
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:36,705
Rym: Oh my god guys.

625
00:43:36,725 --> 00:43:40,521
Rym: We just got to make it Come on, just over that next hill and then we're all dead and it's over.

626
00:43:40,882 --> 00:43:42,929
Rym: We uh, we never survived the war.

627
00:43:43,672 --> 00:43:43,893
Rym: Mm-hmm.

628
00:43:44,195 --> 00:43:46,406
Rym: Also a very perfect thematic bonus.

629
00:43:46,747 --> 00:43:51,484
Rym: There is Literally one card in the entire deck.

630
00:43:51,945 --> 00:43:53,250
Rym: That is not a bad thing.

631
00:43:54,093 --> 00:44:00,336
Rym: There's the Christmas card, all right if the Christmas card comes up It's free parking.

632
00:44:00,356 --> 00:44:02,790
Rym: just nothing happens and the next player takes their turn.

633
00:44:03,111 --> 00:44:11,496
Rym: That is the best possible thing you can do is have one turn where one player does not make things worse Mm-hmm.

634
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:13,350
Rym: Oh, there's also that trap mechanic.

635
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:13,972
Rym: We did so.

636
00:44:14,514 --> 00:44:17,164
Rym: the game also has some push your luck aspects and some of the cards.

637
00:44:17,526 --> 00:44:26,390
Rym: not only do they have a bunch of But they got this trap symbol meaning you then flip over another card from the face down deck.

638
00:44:27,672 --> 00:44:29,078
Rym: It might just kill you.

639
00:44:29,098 --> 00:44:31,990
Rym: Yeah, push your luck when you're near winning the game.

640
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:33,117
Rym: That could be disaster.

641
00:44:33,217 --> 00:44:34,827
Scott: is a lot of pushing your luck going on.

642
00:44:35,028 --> 00:44:41,990
Rym: Yep So, I mean, I don't know what else we could really say except that this game is pretty unique.

643
00:44:42,792 --> 00:44:49,555
Rym: I have not seen other games that are quite like this now and that is the primary reason why I think I want to recommend It to you and independently.

644
00:44:49,575 --> 00:44:52,549
Rym: I actually had a lot more fun with it than I expected to.

645
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:59,170
Scott: We played it a second time Because the first time was so good and we didn't win and we're like we'll try again and we still didn't win.

646
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:00,638
Rym: But it was better and I actually do.

647
00:45:00,658 --> 00:45:02,850
Rym: I'm probably just gonna buy it because I want to play this.

648
00:45:03,151 --> 00:45:06,943
Rym: This would be a good game to play after quartermaster general because quartermaster general.

649
00:45:07,064 --> 00:45:08,910
Rym: I wish I also love is also war.

650
00:45:09,131 --> 00:45:10,945
Rym: It is war but yeah, we're fighting the war.

651
00:45:10,965 --> 00:45:19,475
Rym: Of course It's actually an interesting take too because it's just the logistical and strategic side of the war but not It's a way zoomed out war.

652
00:45:19,495 --> 00:45:23,087
Rym: Yeah, but it's three on three, but it yeah, but it is also still.

653
00:45:23,367 --> 00:45:24,671
Rym: we are fighting this war To win it.

654
00:45:25,032 --> 00:45:29,024
Rym: So I think we should play this game afterward to cleanse the palette and remember.

655
00:45:29,125 --> 00:45:30,348
Rym: Oh, yeah war is awful.

656
