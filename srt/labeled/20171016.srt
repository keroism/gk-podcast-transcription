1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,658
Rym: It's Monday, October 16th, 2017.

2
00:00:10,658 --> 00:00:11,019
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:14,750
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:18,179
Rym: And this is Spooky October GeekNights.

5
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:23,770
Rym: Tonight, we're talking about a terrifying vulnerability in WPA2.

6
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:26,608
Scott: Oh my God, so scary.

7
00:00:29,692 --> 00:00:30,608
Rym: Let's do this.

8
00:00:31,551 --> 00:00:33,886
Rym: Yeah, I'm keeping with the horror theme because we've committed to it.

9
00:00:33,926 --> 00:00:34,449
Rym: I'm doing it.

10
00:00:34,831 --> 00:00:35,949
Scott: Did we remember to do it last time?

11
00:00:36,151 --> 00:00:38,341
Rym: Yeah, I've actually been changing the music too.

12
00:00:38,381 --> 00:00:40,250
Rym: I'm using spooky versions of our theme.

13
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,060
Rym: I'm saying the bits at the end.

14
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,229
Rym: I'm going all out this year.

15
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,529
Rym: I don't think so, except the days we just skipped entirely because we watched a horror show with MSG instead.

16
00:00:53,472 --> 00:00:54,697
Rym: So yeah, we did a thing.

17
00:00:54,717 --> 00:00:57,769
Rym: We have the open-y bit in the show for the main stuff.

18
00:00:57,789 --> 00:00:58,452
Rym: It's not spooky.

19
00:00:58,472 --> 00:01:01,970
Rym: We went over to our friend's house and we did... It wasn't really a convention.

20
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:04,110
Rym: We're just calling it ReviewCon because that's cool.

21
00:01:05,711 --> 00:01:08,109
Scott: Anytime nerds get together, it's now called a con for some reason.

22
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:08,953
Rym: So we did something.

23
00:01:08,973 --> 00:01:21,250
Rym: we called ReviewCon because a problem with GeekNights is that in the old, old days, we had played a lot of games and we started a podcast and we just started reviewing every game we'd ever played.

24
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:21,690
Scott: Right.

25
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:26,769
Scott: Well, I mean, since the year 2000, we played games, a lot of them, right?

26
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:28,375
Scott: In college and otherwise.

27
00:01:28,395 --> 00:01:35,850
Scott: And we started the podcast in 2005, late 2005, and we already had all these games played, five years worth of games to talk about.

28
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,249
Rym: Not just played, but like played the fuck out of.

29
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:38,671
Scott: Right.

30
00:01:38,812 --> 00:01:42,292
Scott: And then, even then, we were living in Beacon with all the fucking free time in the world.

31
00:01:42,353 --> 00:01:44,810
Scott: We played a lot of more games all the time.

32
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:49,788
Scott: And now when you have all the monies of New York to buy a lot of games, you live in New York, you have no time to play games.

33
00:01:51,051 --> 00:01:53,310
Rym: So we just got pros only.

34
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,113
Rym: We sat down.

35
00:01:54,194 --> 00:01:57,694
Scott: Also, I started playing Netrunner instead of going to the Nerd NYC, which we gave up on.

36
00:01:57,714 --> 00:01:59,069
Rym: I'm going to start going back to the Nerd NYC.

37
00:01:59,350 --> 00:01:59,839
Scott: Go for it.

38
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:00,429
Scott: See what's going on.

39
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:01,118
Rym: I'll see if it's good.

40
00:02:01,361 --> 00:02:01,949
Rym: Check it out.

41
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:02,692
Rym: Because if it's good.

42
00:02:04,138 --> 00:02:15,070
Rym: But anyway, so we did this thing and basically we got pros together and we just played tabletop games over and over and over again for as long as we could over the weekend for the primary purpose.

43
00:02:15,451 --> 00:02:28,850
Rym: Not like we had fun, but the goal was to make sure that at least me and Scott played enough mutual new games together and generated enough like photographs and video of it to do real full reviews of these games on game nights.

44
00:02:29,031 --> 00:02:33,729
Scott: And is also Matt because he does his little, you know, his little video on YouTube.

45
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,349
Rym: And we got some vague ideas now.

46
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,470
Scott: What's he called it again?

47
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:45,329
Rym: I don't remember, but we're going to start possibly pooling board game related content creation more than just the two of us trying to do stuff completely on our own.

48
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,069
Scott: We also live streamed the whole thing.

49
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:51,857
Rym: So which we was great until we undermined it by playing two different games at the same time.

50
00:02:52,203 --> 00:02:52,609
Scott: That's fine.

51
00:02:53,652 --> 00:02:54,789
Rym: I think it might get a little chaotic.

52
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:55,131
Rym: We'll see.

53
00:02:55,151 --> 00:02:55,473
Rym: I'm going to.

54
00:02:55,876 --> 00:03:00,749
Rym: I got to get those sorts of videos and mess around, but that's the thing we did and expect some content from that.

55
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:11,050
Rym: So in the news, before we get to the news you all want to talk about, there's actually much more important and amazing news that neither one of us is qualified to talk about.

56
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:11,531
Rym: No.

57
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:21,070
Scott: So basically what happened was is earlier in the year, there was well, not this year, I guess in the time of the dinosaurs, somewhere out.

58
00:03:21,411 --> 00:03:23,570
Scott: So literally in the time of the dinosaurs earlier.

59
00:03:23,811 --> 00:03:31,430
Scott: Yes, there were these two neutron stars out in space, somewhere far away, and they smashed the fuck into each other.

60
00:03:33,198 --> 00:03:34,370
Rym: I think there's a great animation.

61
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:34,753
Rym: Yeah.

62
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:35,629
Rym: Them hitting each other.

63
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:42,228
Scott: And of course, the light from the energy from this explosion did not reach the earth until earlier this year.

64
00:03:42,592 --> 00:03:42,793
Scott: Yep.

65
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:44,850
Scott: Because that's how time and space works.

66
00:03:45,912 --> 00:04:00,708
Scott: And when it did, which is the first anyone knew that it happened, of course, pretty much it was detected by all the telescopes on earth and they started calling each other and pretty much everyone who had a telescope that could detect anything pointed it right at the fucking thing like, oh, shit.

67
00:04:01,651 --> 00:04:09,187
Scott: And all the space astronomers and astrophysicists and everybody, they all teamed up and they said, oh, my God, we collect all the data on this whole issue.

68
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:19,050
Rym: So what basically, you know, if you don't know about gravity waves, they were only recently something we could start to explore as humans.

69
00:04:19,351 --> 00:04:21,389
Scott: And now they detected a whole fucking bunch of.

70
00:04:21,991 --> 00:04:28,290
Rym: So we detected gravitational waves from this event that they're calling a killa nova.

71
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,220
Scott: Yeah, why not?

72
00:04:29,444 --> 00:04:29,648
Scott: Yeah.

73
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,510
Rym: Astronomy, when something new happens, they're still nerds.

74
00:04:32,891 --> 00:04:34,950
Scott: Still, why wouldn't they make it an awesome name?

75
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,182
Scott: Well, I think we're not going to make it some lame ass name.

76
00:04:37,242 --> 00:04:41,310
Rym: when black holes like the theoretical concept of a black hole was discovered.

77
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,370
Rym: They could have named it anything.

78
00:04:42,753 --> 00:04:44,450
Rym: They named it Black Hole.

79
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:47,010
Rym: Yeah, because it is literally a black hole.

80
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:48,289
Scott: And also that's an awesome name.

81
00:04:48,391 --> 00:04:49,529
Rym: That is a pretty awesome name.

82
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:55,750
Rym: So, yeah, the gravity wave detectors that we have built detected this.

83
00:04:56,472 --> 00:05:02,048
Rym: And because we knew where it happened, because we detected it, we pointed all sorts of other sensors at it.

84
00:05:02,631 --> 00:05:23,530
Rym: And this might be this is the first time in history, human history, that we have gathered this much information across these different spectra of data from an event like this, an event that on its own, like you said before we did the show, the fact that we know the thing that we call a neutron star even could exist is crazy.

85
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:23,951
Rym: Yeah.

86
00:05:24,774 --> 00:05:28,470
Rym: So I'm not going to try to summarize all the details of this because I don't know.

87
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,109
Scott: And I'm going to say a bunch of wrong, useless shit.

88
00:05:30,311 --> 00:05:31,989
Scott: Yeah, I know you can read it on your own.

89
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,350
Scott: You have Internet, you have this podcast, therefore you have Internet.

90
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:41,890
Rym: Even worse, most of the like big astronomy stuff I know is from the original cosmos as a kid and like high school.

91
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:44,429
Rym: So it's probably way different by now.

92
00:05:45,092 --> 00:05:49,530
Rym: And I don't know much more about gravity waves than what I already said just now.

93
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,171
Scott: Yeah.

94
00:05:50,954 --> 00:05:57,910
Scott: One thing I do know that I read in one article is that, you know, of course, the actual neutron stars hitting each other is amazing and gravity waves are amazing.

95
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:07,170
Scott: But the other amazing thing is that pretty much this is like the nail in the coffin in the end of like the days of single person scientific discovery.

96
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:07,772
Scott: Oh, yeah.

97
00:06:07,792 --> 00:06:17,290
Scott: There's a lot in this article about because like the LHC like papers or about the Higgs and whatever had like five thousand plus contributors written on them.

98
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:21,630
Scott: And the paper for this is like three to four thousand contributors written on it.

99
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:34,210
Scott: And it's partly it's not just because of new big science from now forever is a team effort where pretty much everyone on Earth who is a specialist in the thing has to team up to be able to make big discoveries like this.

100
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:41,149
Scott: There's no way there's no low hanging fruits anymore for an Einstein or a Newton or the guy who was actually new in what's his name.

101
00:06:42,451 --> 00:06:44,950
Scott: You actually invented the calculus first, whatever.

102
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:50,197
Scott: Yeah, it's basically no room for those people anymore because no fruit low enough that one brain can get it.

103
00:06:50,318 --> 00:06:51,790
Scott: You got to have a thousand brains.

104
00:06:51,970 --> 00:07:03,190
Rym: And this was a trend that was happening because we got from the point of visual observations and then just theory to like computer programming and signals processing is a big part of how astronomy is done.

105
00:07:03,371 --> 00:07:03,653
Scott: Yeah.

106
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,930
Rym: And now gravity waves you need.

107
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:11,330
Scott: So any any big discoveries from now until forever are going to be accomplished by enormous teams of people.

108
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:25,630
Scott: Therefore, even if you're not in science, whatever your endeavor is, you if you want to do something big, you should team up because, you know, it's getting harder for individuals to make great accomplishments in the world anyway in any field.

109
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:31,202
Rym: Like there's one guy, Charlie Kilpatrick, because he was noted in this article, they were all trying to look at this thing.

110
00:07:31,303 --> 00:07:32,892
Rym: now that, you know, they knew something was happening.

111
00:07:33,675 --> 00:07:45,169
Rym: And the relevant quote from this article is, quote, Charlie is the first person, as far as far as we know, the first human to have ever seen optical photons from a gravitational wave event.

112
00:07:46,652 --> 00:08:00,973
Rym: This is cool stuff and kind of like how the like electro telescopes, like electromagnetic analysis and background radiation, all those things that revolutionized astronomy and made everything we knew up to that point kind of obsolete.

113
00:08:01,053 --> 00:08:03,630
Rym: I feel like this might be a similar turning point.

114
00:08:04,131 --> 00:08:16,310
Scott: Also, this is apparently such a crazy explosion, this Nova, that if you had a normal amateur telescope, obviously, maybe not a really crap one, but like, you know, the kind that you can buy at the store, you could have seen.

115
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:22,889
Rym: So in other spooky news, we're going to talk about the WPA vulnerability as the main bit, because that's the big one.

116
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:28,070
Rym: But a similarly big thing also appears to have happened today.

117
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:28,571
Scott: Right.

118
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:40,470
Scott: So we it's weird how we always talk about things that we want governments to do like, hey, you should make public private keys to your citizens that like security number, you should get a private key at birth from the government.

119
00:08:41,073 --> 00:08:42,549
Scott: Oh, we should make digital monies.

120
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,789
Scott: Oh, we should do all these things.

121
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:51,310
Scott: But then it turns out when those things actually get implemented in the real world, they're always sort of sort of dystopian and evil form that we don't want.

122
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,029
Scott: No one does things in the good way.

123
00:08:53,573 --> 00:08:54,930
Scott: It's like, please make this.

124
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:55,736
Scott: All right, I made it.

125
00:08:55,858 --> 00:08:57,030
Scott: Why did you make it evil?

126
00:08:57,911 --> 00:08:58,870
Scott: So please make me a cake.

127
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:00,349
Scott: Why did you put poop in the cake?

128
00:09:00,651 --> 00:09:05,850
Rym: There's a lot of reasons why Estonia, in many regards, is way ahead of the curve in terms of technology.

129
00:09:06,331 --> 00:09:16,270
Scott: This was the news when they first did it, because we were like, oh, a government is making cool technological ID cards like all modern and science and Internet offering Internet citizenship and stuff.

130
00:09:16,491 --> 00:09:17,970
Rym: It was literally the thing I always wanted.

131
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:18,311
Rym: Right.

132
00:09:18,351 --> 00:09:21,424
Scott: The basic concept of it was great, but it turns out.

133
00:09:21,444 --> 00:09:24,530
Scott: the actual implementation is not great and Estonia is not great.

134
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:32,949
Rym: So as far as I can tell, they use RSA and every citizen is given a card with a twenty forty eight bit RSA key.

135
00:09:34,051 --> 00:09:34,858
Rym: That's great.

136
00:09:34,979 --> 00:09:36,310
Rym: That's fantastic encryption.

137
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:41,109
Scott: That's not going to be broken as long as they're doing evil things like denying the cards to poor people and whatnot.

138
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:45,671
Rym: Yeah, you know, well, about all those concerns aside, requiring the cards in order to vote.

139
00:09:46,012 --> 00:09:52,190
Rym: Apparently, what happened is an RSA library that this company Infineon developed.

140
00:09:52,812 --> 00:10:05,430
Rym: And I don't know if they developed it for this or it was just used for this, but the algorithm to generate the prime numbers used by RSA for these keys was vulnerable to factorization attacks.

141
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:19,491
Rym: Also that from the public key alone and within a matter of days, a computer can attempt factor look for factors that will generate the prime numbers that will match that public key.

142
00:10:19,813 --> 00:10:25,869
Rym: So from your public key, someone can derive your private key, making this encryption fucking useless.

143
00:10:26,151 --> 00:10:35,890
Rym: Yeah, because if someone gets a private key and this is relevant to the later discussion, if someone compromises like symmetric keys or whatever, there's lots of ways to get around that in terms of encryption.

144
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:46,750
Rym: But if someone gets your private key, you are just fucked because your private key can be used to pretend to be you and encrypt anything as you and decrypt anything as effective.

145
00:10:46,891 --> 00:10:57,689
Scott: also, even though they generated the keys stupidly and they could have just generated good keys with like open SSH, however, that your open SSL is they could have made perfectly good keys with that.

146
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,416
Scott: They chose not to.

147
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:03,330
Scott: The government was making both keys and then giving you both keys.

148
00:11:03,531 --> 00:11:04,408
Scott: It's like, no, no, no, no, no.

149
00:11:05,391 --> 00:11:08,856
Scott: How do you know the government of Estonia wasn't just keeping copies of all the private keys?

150
00:11:08,896 --> 00:11:09,468
Scott: That doesn't work.

151
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:14,529
Scott: You actually have to make the keys on your own or else it's already useless, regardless of what method is used.

152
00:11:14,771 --> 00:11:21,370
Rym: Or you set it up where the government makes a key, but you input a passphrase for that key in a means that they cannot get.

153
00:11:22,254 --> 00:11:24,166
Scott: No, you have to make that on your own.

154
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,848
Rym: You need the card with the crypto key in it.

155
00:11:27,371 --> 00:11:28,689
Scott: Maybe you don't make your own key.

156
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:29,554
Scott: Then it doesn't work.

157
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:33,155
Scott: No, the government cannot have the private key or ever see it ever.

158
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:34,109
Scott: Otherwise, fuck it.

159
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:38,649
Rym: But even the government having the private key in some fashion is not as bad as this.

160
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:39,515
Scott: Yeah, it is.

161
00:11:40,524 --> 00:11:41,210
Scott: They have the key.

162
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:42,301
Scott: They don't even need to factor it.

163
00:11:42,322 --> 00:11:42,908
Scott: They just have it.

164
00:11:43,592 --> 00:11:49,150
Rym: Well, so here anyone with your public key can make your private key.

165
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,770
Scott: Yes, it's also a bad quote.

166
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:56,149
Rym: It means that if you have a document digitally signed with someone's private key, you can't prove is really them who signed it.

167
00:11:56,591 --> 00:12:01,873
Rym: Or if you send sensitive data encrypted under someone's public key, you can't be sure that only they read it.

168
00:12:02,636 --> 00:12:11,613
Rym: It's literally a disaster like this is as big a disaster, if not more so than the fact that like all of America's Social Security numbers just got released.

169
00:12:11,633 --> 00:12:14,190
Scott: You got to make all new keys for everybody, just like the U.S.

170
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:21,390
Rym: needs to make all new Social Security numbers for everybody or get rid of Social Security numbers because that private company just released them all anyway.

171
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:22,590
Rym: That's a separate discussion.

172
00:12:23,192 --> 00:12:25,310
Rym: So you can read this article if you want to know the details.

173
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:32,250
Rym: But the fundamental moral here, if you take nothing else away from this article, don't roll your own fucking encryption.

174
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,269
Rym: You're going to do it wrong.

175
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:35,038
Rym: Do not write.

176
00:12:35,058 --> 00:12:36,630
Scott: There's already open source encryption.

177
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:37,441
Scott: That's just fine.

178
00:12:37,461 --> 00:12:37,888
Scott: Just use it.

179
00:12:38,253 --> 00:12:39,489
Scott: Why would you do anything else?

180
00:12:39,732 --> 00:12:40,382
Scott: It's already out there.

181
00:12:40,402 --> 00:12:40,808
Scott: Just use it.

182
00:12:46,421 --> 00:12:50,280
Rym: But anyway, things of the day, because we have a lot to say in the main bit.

183
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,626
Rym: So what do you got?

184
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:54,440
Scott: So apparently I had this game as a kid.

185
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:59,420
Scott: It wasn't a very good game, but it wasn't a so awful game that you couldn't play.

186
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,620
Scott: It is Sonic 3D blast for the Sega Genesis.

187
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,404
Rym: It's one of the.

188
00:13:03,605 --> 00:13:06,240
Scott: it's a really interesting and unique kind of game.

189
00:13:06,462 --> 00:13:09,100
Scott: If you've ever played it, it's a little frustrating.

190
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:13,980
Scott: I wouldn't like recommend you spend that much time on it other than like investigate and see what the deal is.

191
00:13:14,121 --> 00:13:17,860
Scott: Anyway, it's interesting because apparently I didn't know this as a kid.

192
00:13:19,022 --> 00:13:32,802
Scott: If you have the game and you sort of bump it like the cartridge, like you bump it a little bit, like physically like the cartridges in the Genesis and you like bump it, you might and are actually quite likely to end up at like a cheating stage select screen.

193
00:13:34,129 --> 00:13:36,160
Scott: I had to like enter codes to get to that screen.

194
00:13:36,622 --> 00:13:39,440
Scott: But apparently you can just get to that screen by bumping the cartridge around.

195
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,720
Scott: Yeah, it's like, what the hell?

196
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:49,720
Scott: So a guy who programmed the damn game made a YouTube video explaining how why this happens and the gist of it is that is really funny.

197
00:13:50,101 --> 00:13:53,220
Scott: Yeah, you submit games for testing, right?

198
00:13:53,982 --> 00:14:01,746
Scott: You know, it had to be approved before they could be put on cartridges like, you know, Sega or Nintendo would do their own testing before they applied the seal of quality, right?

199
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:02,900
Scott: Be it Nintendo or Sega.

200
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:08,385
Scott: And if you had your game crashed, you obviously got rejected and that cost you a lot of time and money.

201
00:14:08,405 --> 00:14:10,419
Scott: You wanted to get passed on the first try.

202
00:14:11,262 --> 00:14:14,359
Scott: And even if you didn't get passed, you wanted to know what the hell the error was.

203
00:14:15,361 --> 00:14:15,542
Scott: Right.

204
00:14:15,562 --> 00:14:23,240
Scott: So they would put code in the game, you know, to like send them, you know, so that they would see what the errors were when, you know, testing happened.

205
00:14:23,661 --> 00:14:30,460
Scott: But then when they actually submitted and they wanted the game to get passed, you replace the exception handling code with stage select screens.

206
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,080
Scott: Basically, if any, you know, they reduce the errors a whole bunch.

207
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:33,913
Scott: There's almost none.

208
00:14:34,015 --> 00:14:34,198
Rym: Yep.

209
00:14:35,123 --> 00:14:36,579
Scott: And they figure out this game can pass.

210
00:14:37,082 --> 00:14:42,539
Scott: And then it's like, well, in case there is an error of some kind, just go to the stage select screen instead of the error page.

211
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:46,980
Scott: And that way, Nintendo or Sega will approve the game because it never graduations.

212
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,980
Rym: You have found the secret levels like screen in blue.

213
00:14:50,281 --> 00:14:53,680
Scott: It never goes to any sort of crashing screen.

214
00:14:54,222 --> 00:14:54,423
Scott: Right.

215
00:14:54,483 --> 00:14:57,100
Scott: If there's any kind of freaky error, it goes to the stage select screen.

216
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:01,581
Rym: I think if the tester complained, you could just be like, yeah, you found the secret code.

217
00:15:01,802 --> 00:15:02,304
Rym: Yeah.

218
00:15:02,585 --> 00:15:07,829
Scott: So when you played the game, it was it was solid enough that I never got to the screen accidentally.

219
00:15:07,849 --> 00:15:09,039
Scott: The game never crashed on me.

220
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:09,520
Scott: Right.

221
00:15:10,002 --> 00:15:17,879
Scott: But if you bump the cartridge, that may just cause an exception when some data gets mangled or whatever, and thus you end up at the stage select screen.

222
00:15:18,081 --> 00:15:18,384
Scott: Yeah.

223
00:15:19,153 --> 00:15:19,699
Scott: So it's pretty cool.

224
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,899
Rym: So, Scott, do you what is a fractal?

225
00:15:23,441 --> 00:15:26,620
Scott: So a fractal is you basically make a grid.

226
00:15:26,942 --> 00:15:27,184
Scott: Right.

227
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:29,000
Scott: But not well, I guess a plane.

228
00:15:29,422 --> 00:15:35,840
Scott: And instead of going X, Y, which is real numbers, you go real numbers, then use complex numbers on the vertical axis.

229
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:36,382
Scott: Right.

230
00:15:36,924 --> 00:15:42,460
Scott: And then so you got you know, you got, you know, infinity to negative infinity on the on the horizontal.

231
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:49,338
Scott: And you got, I guess, complex infinity and complex negative infinity on the on the vertical where the Y would normally be.

232
00:15:50,002 --> 00:15:56,560
Scott: And then you make a little function and you input a number into this function, like starting with, say, one or something or, you know, negative one.

233
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:06,824
Scott: Who knows what you start with and you input into the function and number comes out and you plot that on, you know, you put the real number in and the complex number comes out and you plot it on the thing

234
00:16:07,447 --> 00:16:12,598
Rym: that is a very computer science person who had to implement an algorithm to make these.

235
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,643
Scott: Then you take.

236
00:16:13,763 --> 00:16:17,784
Scott: then you take the output, you know, the answer you just got and that's your new input.

237
00:16:18,187 --> 00:16:19,959
Scott: And you put that in the input and you plot that.

238
00:16:20,361 --> 00:16:24,560
Scott: And then, you know, if it's in the set, it's, you know, give you a nice color.

239
00:16:24,922 --> 00:16:28,000
Scott: If it's not in the set, then it's black or vice versa.

240
00:16:28,503 --> 00:16:30,119
Scott: And now you draw cool fractal.

241
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:30,987
Rym: What if it's 3D or 4D?

242
00:16:32,923 --> 00:16:34,719
Scott: Then it's hard to look at, but you can still do it.

243
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:35,409
Rym: All right.

244
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:35,755
Rym: Can it be 1D?

245
00:16:36,961 --> 00:16:38,180
Scott: I don't know, but maybe.

246
00:16:38,761 --> 00:16:40,250
Rym: So does it.

247
00:16:40,351 --> 00:16:40,552
Rym: is it?

248
00:16:41,075 --> 00:16:41,900
Rym: is it self-similar?

249
00:16:42,745 --> 00:16:43,638
Scott: I don't know what that means.

250
00:16:43,982 --> 00:16:45,700
Rym: Meaning if you zoom in, it's the same.

251
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:53,260
Scott: Yeah, you can zoom in forever because you can just keep using, you know, smaller and smaller or, you know, greater precision and much more decimal points.

252
00:16:53,682 --> 00:16:57,340
Scott: And you can zoom in forever and you'll see the same pattern again eventually.

253
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:01,640
Rym: So fractals do not actually have to be self-similar to be fractals.

254
00:17:01,961 --> 00:17:03,839
Scott: OK, that's a semantic thing, but OK.

255
00:17:04,305 --> 00:17:05,300
Rym: It matters a lot, actually.

256
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,919
Rym: So I didn't know a lot about this.

257
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,920
Rym: I had a pretty superficial understanding of fractals more.

258
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,799
Rym: And, you know, most people think of like Mandelbrot sets.

259
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:16,020
Scott: Yeah, Mandelbrot sets, Sierpinski triangles, Julia sets.

260
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,176
Rym: Sierpinski triangle is like probably the easiest.

261
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:19,500
Scott: Yes, the babies first.

262
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:21,779
Rym: Well, because you can just draw it yourself, like if you really want to.

263
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,299
Scott: And then you get Mandelbrot set, Julia set.

264
00:17:23,401 --> 00:17:25,540
Scott: And then there's a whole bunch of other ones that don't have famous names.

265
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:31,200
Rym: So the real key that defines fractals and fractal math is the dimensionality.

266
00:17:31,561 --> 00:17:42,520
Rym: Like and I guess as far as I can tell from this video, because this video pushes significantly beyond the math that I know without having to look a bunch of stuff up.

267
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,840
Rym: Fractals are basically shapes where the dimensionality is not a counting number.

268
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:54,579
Rym: So they're like they have a dimensionality of like one point two as opposed to one or two or three.

269
00:17:55,483 --> 00:17:57,720
Scott: So it's something that has one and a half dimensions.

270
00:17:58,181 --> 00:17:58,525
Rym: Yeah.

271
00:17:58,545 --> 00:17:59,920
Scott: How does that even fucking work?

272
00:18:00,141 --> 00:18:00,383
Rym: Yeah.

273
00:18:00,403 --> 00:18:03,080
Rym: So this video and they use the coastline of Britain.

274
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,960
Scott: I can imagine zero, one, two and three dimensions.

275
00:18:06,101 --> 00:18:08,049
Scott: And I can sort of imagine four dimensions.

276
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:12,520
Scott: poorly because I can know that I've seen three dimensional shadows of four dimensional objects.

277
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,180
Rym: So it's basically as far as I can tell, I can't even imagine like anything.

278
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,839
Scott: Point five, anything deep.

279
00:18:18,341 --> 00:18:25,900
Rym: So the fractals that most of us think about, like the ones that you mentioned, are the ones that are pretty or interesting and they're usually self-similar.

280
00:18:26,641 --> 00:18:35,640
Rym: But the whole point of fractal math is to be able to model things that are not smooth and self-similar, but that are rough and complicated.

281
00:18:36,221 --> 00:18:36,342
Scott: Yes.

282
00:18:36,363 --> 00:18:37,880
Scott: Fractals are really rough and complicated.

283
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:46,820
Rym: So the idea to add roughness, like the example I give in this video is that calculus likes to say that if you zoom in enough, something is smooth and simple and easy to understand.

284
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,280
Rym: Fractal is the idea that no matter how long you zoom in, it's still rough and complicated.

285
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:57,913
Rym: So this video, and this is why I'm not going to say anything more about it, because I've probably already said like 10 things that Dr.

286
00:18:57,953 --> 00:18:59,280
Rym: Hazard is going to yell at me about.

287
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:07,760
Rym: But this video, if you watch those Numberphile videos that we've linked to often, Numberphile videos are comprehensible to me.

288
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:11,380
Scott: I understand everything and every Numberphile video I've watched and paid attention to.

289
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:28,600
Rym: Numberphile seems to increasingly reference this channel, 3Blue1Brown, which I just realized is called that because the conceit is that there's one brown pi symbol and three blue pi symbols, and the three blue ones ask the dumb questions that we ask.

290
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:30,066
Scott: It's like Passover.

291
00:19:30,167 --> 00:19:34,303
Scott: There's the the evil child, the I guess.

292
00:19:34,343 --> 00:19:37,779
Scott: in Passover, there's four questions, the wise son, the wicked son.

293
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:38,281
Rym: Oh, my God.

294
00:19:38,322 --> 00:19:44,240
Rym: Tracy just gave yet another example of what he thinks the fractal is, but they don't have to be self-similar.

295
00:19:44,841 --> 00:19:49,680
Scott: So Numberphile will, I guess, is baby's first version of this.

296
00:19:49,921 --> 00:19:51,660
Scott: Well, I'm baby's first, obviously.

297
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,519
Rym: Numberphile will basically say things like three times.

298
00:19:54,742 --> 00:19:56,180
Rym: Here's a cool Numberphile thing.

299
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,180
Rym: By the way, this definition is actually simplified.

300
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:02,680
Rym: If you want to know the real story, go to this 3Blue1Brown channel.

301
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:05,640
Scott: Yeah, see, Numberphile makes me think like, hey, I could be a mathematician.

302
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,831
Scott: No, you can't.

303
00:20:07,093 --> 00:20:07,679
Scott: No, you can't.

304
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:13,100
Scott: 3Blue1Brown says, all the people talking on Numberphile understand 3Blue1Brown easily.

305
00:20:13,681 --> 00:20:15,099
Scott: So 3Blue1Brown, I can't do that.

306
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,420
Rym: If you watch these videos like I grasp the concepts, barely.

307
00:20:20,701 --> 00:20:22,948
Rym: Yeah, and the maths are.

308
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:30,860
Rym: if I applied myself in college and didn't just give up on maths once I got to college, I could probably partially understand them.

309
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,089
Scott: I was right to give up on math.

310
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,179
Scott: That's what this video tells me.

311
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,400
Rym: You know what the problem is, though?

312
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,639
Rym: In high school, that was the thing I was the best at.

313
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:41,300
Rym: And the only reason I didn't continue with it is that I was great at math until calculus.

314
00:20:41,522 --> 00:20:42,732
Scott: All the other kinds of math.

315
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:43,519
Scott: I was way good.

316
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,571
Rym: See, no calculus.

317
00:20:44,713 --> 00:20:45,240
Rym: I did fucking ace.

318
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,353
Scott: I could have been a statistician.

319
00:20:46,394 --> 00:20:46,819
Scott: I'm good at that.

320
00:20:47,261 --> 00:20:55,160
Rym: I got into complex 3D nonsense and like the like multiple derivatives and all this weird crap and Gaussian services.

321
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,818
Rym: And it was awesome and I loved it.

322
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:01,160
Rym: But then when I went to go to college, Al Biles was like, don't do anything hard.

323
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,024
Rym: Just be IT.

324
00:21:02,045 --> 00:21:03,453
Rym: You'll make money to play my trumpet.

325
00:21:05,362 --> 00:21:07,200
Rym: I wrote a program that's playing along with me.

326
00:21:07,281 --> 00:21:08,192
Rym: You can do stuff like that.

327
00:21:08,273 --> 00:21:08,820
Rym: It's great.

328
00:21:09,141 --> 00:21:09,343
Rym: Yep.

329
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:11,020
Rym: And I was like, you know what?

330
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:11,827
Rym: I'm done with math.

331
00:21:11,948 --> 00:21:13,280
Scott: I'm convinced by the trumpet man.

332
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,740
Scott: This Pied Piper has taken me to computer and money land.

333
00:21:16,223 --> 00:21:16,867
Scott: And he was right.

334
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:18,960
Scott: And it was a wise trumpet man.

335
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,120
Scott: So he didn't Pied Piper the rats out of town.

336
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,080
Scott: He Pied Piper the rats right in the Fortnite.

337
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,218
Rym: I had to take like one calculus class at RIT.

338
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:26,342
Scott: Rym's the rat.

339
00:21:26,543 --> 00:21:31,900
Rym: Compared to what I did in high school, that calculus two, three stuff at RIT was like baby calculus.

340
00:21:32,723 --> 00:21:33,880
Scott: I've got to see a calculus.

341
00:21:34,181 --> 00:21:35,480
Scott: One was baby calculus.

342
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:40,403
Scott: What I did in high school, I watched the what's the integral of two X. Yeah.

343
00:21:40,423 --> 00:21:44,200
Scott: Then calculus two, half of it was babies first and half of it I didn't learn.

344
00:21:44,481 --> 00:21:54,680
Rym: But luckily Rym's TI 89 was able to help me get a C because I forgot I had that TI 89 can integrate kind of because I bought it and I only used it in one class.

345
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,520
Scott: I only had 86 that couldn't do calculus.

346
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,681
Scott: And then I had 85.

347
00:21:58,681 --> 00:21:59,528
Scott: Yeah.

348
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:00,495
Scott: You also had 89 that I bought.

349
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:07,334
Rym: I bought the 89 at RIT because I had to take one like fucking stupid calculus class because RIT wouldn't eat food.

350
00:22:08,163 --> 00:22:09,201
Scott: But you bought a TI 89.

351
00:22:09,201 --> 00:22:09,402
Rym: Yeah.

352
00:22:09,422 --> 00:22:09,825
Rym: You know what?

353
00:22:09,986 --> 00:22:12,360
Rym: Because in that stats class, I was not doing that shit by hand.

354
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:16,541
Scott: Anyway, this for stats, I was finally 86.

355
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:19,980
Scott: And then calculus three, I just failed two times, three times.

356
00:22:20,061 --> 00:22:21,009
Scott: Maybe I don't remember.

357
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,300
Rym: What was your calculus three?

358
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,319
Rym: Like what was in that class?

359
00:22:24,121 --> 00:22:27,880
Scott: It was like, you know, some of stuff over a series.

360
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:32,080
Scott: Now, does it converge or not and not remember anything else?

361
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,038
Scott: Because obviously if I did, I wouldn't have failed.

362
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:34,642
Scott: Yeah.

363
00:22:34,722 --> 00:22:40,039
Scott: And then I took it in the summer and got to see, because when you take a class in the summer with only like 10 people, everyone gets to see.

364
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,378
Rym: Discrete math was probably, and like Diffie Q were like the most fun things I remember doing in high school.

365
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:47,621
Scott: Oh yeah.

366
00:22:47,642 --> 00:22:47,985
Scott: I'm way good.

367
00:22:48,147 --> 00:22:49,440
Scott: I'm way good at discrete math.

368
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,939
Scott: Not Diffie Q that much.

369
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,019
Rym: Diffie Q I enjoyed the most, I think.

370
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,600
Scott: But I'm good at math that use normal numbers and not weird shit.

371
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:01,465
Rym: So when I was a kid taking those classes, I go to my parents like, here's what I'm doing in high school.

372
00:23:01,506 --> 00:23:02,659
Rym: They didn't know what the fuck it was.

373
00:23:03,221 --> 00:23:13,720
Rym: But now, if Rym from like 1998 came to Rym today and showed Rym today the math Rym in 1998 was doing, Rym today doesn't know what the fuck that is.

374
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,200
Scott: No, I don't know.

375
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:14,860
Scott: It's all gone.

376
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:15,113
Rym: Nope.

377
00:23:15,321 --> 00:23:15,878
Rym: I lost it.

378
00:23:16,164 --> 00:23:16,840
Rym: It's gone forever.

379
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:17,708
Scott: Let's do the meta moment.

380
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:18,801
Rym: Yeah.

381
00:23:18,841 --> 00:23:20,798
Rym: This video is great and you should watch it.

382
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:30,020
Rym: And I'm curious what you think of it, because I know a lot more about fractals now, more the practical applications of fractals as opposed to cool Mandelbrot sets.

383
00:23:31,022 --> 00:23:33,160
Rym: So, yeah, in the meta moment, the Book Club book is the fifth season.

384
00:23:33,522 --> 00:23:34,318
Rym: I'm almost done with it.

385
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,119
Scott: So the next Thursday episode, we're probably going to discuss this book.

386
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,280
Scott: So if you read it, I hope you read it.

387
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:46,800
Rym: And you know what, if you haven't read the second one, so I don't mess up that episode of GeekNights, I'm going to read the other two books based on what I've read so far.

388
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:53,640
Scott: I mean, people are telling me, some people are telling me at least that the other books are not good, but the second book did win the Hugo Award, just like the first one.

389
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,835
Rym: And I really want to know some stuff.

390
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,680
Scott: How bad is it really going to hurt me to read the at least the second one?

391
00:23:59,741 --> 00:24:00,520
Scott: I'll see for myself.

392
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,480
Scott: I don't know if I can trust everybody.

393
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:09,920
Rym: So takeaways so far is I'm curious if you're at what point different people figure out who different characters are in relation to all these stories.

394
00:24:10,544 --> 00:24:12,120
Rym: You know, the timeline situation.

395
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,144
Rym: Yeah.

396
00:24:13,386 --> 00:24:15,920
Rym: Number two, how hot is that pirate captain?

397
00:24:16,741 --> 00:24:17,323
Rym: So hot.

398
00:24:17,645 --> 00:24:21,999
Rym: That guy is the hottest guy in any media so far.

399
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:23,456
Scott: Any media ever.

400
00:24:24,221 --> 00:24:25,319
Scott: He's Akio hot.

401
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:32,180
Rym: Well, because he's vaguely described into like certain like details of the world are often vaguely described to get these impressions of things.

402
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:38,259
Rym: The impression of him that he might be the hottest human being to have ever been crafted by man or beast.

403
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,205
Rym: Yeah.

404
00:24:39,225 --> 00:24:41,160
Rym: And it's real hard to dissuade me from that opinion.

405
00:24:44,052 --> 00:24:44,380
Rym: And what else?

406
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,066
Rym: I want to know what.

407
00:24:45,086 --> 00:24:46,440
Rym: I want to know what the deal is with that socket.

408
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:47,284
Scott: Yeah.

409
00:24:47,304 --> 00:24:48,880
Scott: I mean, of course, I was one of the terrible secrets.

410
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,640
Rym: I have a feeling that the socket is not revealed by the end of this case.

411
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,718
Scott: The terrible secret of Earth.

412
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:53,261
Rym: Yeah.

413
00:24:53,542 --> 00:24:58,140
Rym: I want to know more about that implant, too, especially because them guardians.

414
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,079
Scott: They're the coolest ninjas.

415
00:24:59,281 --> 00:24:59,482
Scott: Yeah.

416
00:24:59,522 --> 00:25:03,080
Rym: But at the same time, I feel like half the guardians go insane.

417
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,240
Rym: Like there's an implication.

418
00:25:05,441 --> 00:25:06,839
Rym: And I want to know what's going on.

419
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,520
Rym: There's also some Hokuto no Ken with the guardians.

420
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,699
Rym: The tap tap on the back of the skull.

421
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,088
Scott: I said they're ninjas.

422
00:25:13,108 --> 00:25:14,860
Rym: Yeah, he's not a ninja.

423
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,359
Rym: He's just a. he's a grandpa ninja.

424
00:25:19,486 --> 00:25:20,320
Scott: Any other meta thing?

425
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:23,520
Scott: So the next convention we are going to is Pax Unplugged.

426
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,306
Scott: Oh my God.

427
00:25:24,326 --> 00:25:26,020
Scott: It's the week before Thanksgiving.

428
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,339
Rym: It is a month away.

429
00:25:27,681 --> 00:25:33,240
Scott: Also, the first week of Thanksgiving, the first week of November, that weekend has too much shit going on.

430
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,164
Scott: Here's all my God.

431
00:25:34,225 --> 00:25:37,100
Scott: Here's all the shit that is going on in the first weekend of November.

432
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:37,725
Scott: Are you ready?

433
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,260
Scott: Gamer X East.

434
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:39,930
Scott: Are we going to that?

435
00:25:40,215 --> 00:25:40,499
Rym: I don't know.

436
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,540
Rym: So they're having trouble scheduling their panels, as far as I can tell.

437
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:51,080
Rym: So I got an email from them and they were like, you are one of the panels we want to schedule, but we're having a hard time deciding.

438
00:25:51,181 --> 00:25:54,720
Rym: So they asked me to, like, explain a lot more detail about what we're going to present.

439
00:25:55,002 --> 00:25:57,500
Rym: And I gave them a ton of stuff and then they didn't get back to me.

440
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:57,941
Scott: All right.

441
00:25:57,962 --> 00:26:00,400
Scott: Anyway, so we might go to that one day.

442
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:05,380
Scott: Probably, you know, we went to it last year, actually saw last year at Gamer X East.

443
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:06,408
Scott: I saw N.K.

444
00:26:06,429 --> 00:26:07,820
Scott: Jemisin, author of Fifth Season.

445
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,322
Scott: Oh, yeah.

446
00:26:08,804 --> 00:26:11,960
Scott: Anyway, and she was totally nerding out about Dragon Age stuff.

447
00:26:12,981 --> 00:26:13,062
Scott: OK.

448
00:26:13,364 --> 00:26:15,560
Scott: Also happening that weekend, New York City Marathon.

449
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:20,340
Scott: I don't know if anyone cares, but if I'm not doing anything else on that Sunday, I could do the thing we did last year.

450
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,800
Scott: We bike the marathon route before they close it.

451
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,779
Rym: Oh, yeah, I'll do that again.

452
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:24,221
Rym: Maybe.

453
00:26:25,285 --> 00:26:25,506
Scott: OK.

454
00:26:25,526 --> 00:26:28,636
Scott: The other thing that is happening that weekend is the BlizzCon.

455
00:26:30,367 --> 00:26:30,878
Rym: Oh, yeah.

456
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:34,459
Scott: Championships of Hearthstone, Overwatch, et cetera, et cetera.

457
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,300
Scott: It's the BlizzCon Friday and Saturday.

458
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,380
Scott: BlizzCon is not Sunday.

459
00:26:37,903 --> 00:26:39,339
Rym: So last year I didn't really watch a lot.

460
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:43,940
Rym: But this year, now that I've gone from being steeped in Overwatch to being fucking steeped in Overwatch.

461
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,846
Scott: So I usually I like.

462
00:26:45,866 --> 00:26:49,140
Scott: I never planned to like watch BlizzCon or anything.

463
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:56,500
Scott: But what happened is, is not only is the for the past few years, the first weekend of November has always been BlizzCon.

464
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:01,200
Scott: It is also always been the Fantasy Flight Games World Championship.

465
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:12,320
Scott: So what end up happening inevitably is I would go to Twitch to watch the Netrunner World Championships, which are, again, the first weekend of November and end up seeing, oh, Hearthstone World Championship.

466
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:16,819
Scott: Also, let me spend my whole weekend watching card game world championships.

467
00:27:17,921 --> 00:27:20,659
Scott: So as you got four things for your first weekend of November there.

468
00:27:21,921 --> 00:27:24,160
Rym: And then other cons coming up, we're going to be at PAX South.

469
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:29,679
Rym: We're going to be at Magfest and et cetera.

470
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:32,880
Scott: But at PAX East tickets are going to go on sale.

471
00:27:33,602 --> 00:27:37,100
Scott: Not before PAX South, but right after not PAX South.

472
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,680
Scott: OSS, PAX OSS is real soon, like a few weeks away.

473
00:27:40,082 --> 00:27:40,825
Scott: It's in October.

474
00:27:40,885 --> 00:27:44,060
Scott: It's currently October right after PAX OSS.

475
00:27:44,421 --> 00:27:48,860
Scott: You got to be on the PAX East alarm for tickets if you need to buy them and you're not enforcing or something.

476
00:27:50,088 --> 00:27:50,352
Scott: Yeah.

477
00:27:50,433 --> 00:27:51,020
Scott: Pay attention.

478
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:57,520
Rym: So at PAX Unplugged on Saturday, we are doing the kind of thing we did at old PAX's.

479
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:05,740
Rym: We're going to do this two hour event where we're going to teach everybody the like super pro dick moves of Carcassonne.

480
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:08,659
Scott: We're going to teach you how to play Carcassonne, even if you never played it.

481
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:13,920
Scott: Then we're going to teach you how to win at Carcassonne and be the best, all the best Carcassonne strategies.

482
00:28:14,323 --> 00:28:16,240
Scott: So there'll be nothing you don't know about Carcassonne.

483
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:19,980
Scott: And then there'll be a Carcassonne tournament, a single elimination.

484
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:20,840
Rym: We can unleash.

485
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:25,940
Scott: I want to see what happens when a bunch of people who have just been given expert knowledge unleash that upon each other.

486
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:28,600
Scott: Yeah, we're going to make monster can be only one winner.

487
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,364
Scott: It's a tournament.

488
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,798
Rym: We're making monsters and having them fight for us.

489
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,212
Scott: It's going to be amazing.

490
00:28:33,232 --> 00:28:33,780
Scott: It's going to be awesome.

491
00:28:34,461 --> 00:28:37,579
Rym: So that's going to be on Saturday for two hours in tabletop tourney.

492
00:28:39,081 --> 00:28:43,520
Rym: So I was at work like in a bunch of, you know, Monday is when I have a bunch of meetings, every job I've ever had.

493
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:48,200
Rym: Monday is like all the status meetings and the sprint meetings and the stand ups and everything.

494
00:28:49,962 --> 00:28:54,500
Rym: So Scott like messaged me a bunch and he's like something, something, something WPA vulnerability.

495
00:28:55,202 --> 00:28:58,840
Rym: And I think in the back of my head, all right, that'll be an interesting thing to go read about.

496
00:28:59,100 --> 00:28:59,683
Scott: Apparently not.

497
00:28:59,703 --> 00:29:02,780
Scott: When I woke up, there was a news WPA is completely broken.

498
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,402
Scott: And then it was.

499
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:10,320
Scott: and then 10 minutes when I like actually left the house and read the Internet a second time on the subway, it was on every single site.

500
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,589
Scott: It was in the feed like 20 times.

501
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:20,500
Rym: Usually when there's a news like important thing has vulnerability, you do zoom in and people were kind of trumping up how bad it was.

502
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,519
Scott: Or there's something on just tech sites for nerds.

503
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:33,515
Rym: This is on every website and rightfully so, because this one affects everyone, everybody, you know, it doesn't affect people still using WEP because they're just still as fucked as they were.

504
00:29:33,556 --> 00:29:33,719
Rym: Right.

505
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,020
Scott: So we're going to not just talk about this vulnerability.

506
00:29:36,281 --> 00:29:38,940
Scott: I also want to talk about the security of Wi-Fi in general.

507
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:39,321
Scott: Right.

508
00:29:39,341 --> 00:29:42,233
Rym: We're not going to go into the details because we're not.

509
00:29:42,253 --> 00:29:43,760
Scott: we're just going to get the concepts here.

510
00:29:44,402 --> 00:29:47,900
Scott: So you have what you need to know to make it through this world safely.

511
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:52,720
Rym: So ostensibly, we do know a lot about like the details of WEP and WPA and everything.

512
00:29:53,061 --> 00:30:00,600
Rym: But the reality is, I don't remember a lot of those details because the last time I actually cared was when I had to take tests on it at RIT.

513
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,061
Scott: Right.

514
00:30:01,082 --> 00:30:02,520
Scott: So now here's the fundamental thing.

515
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:06,060
Scott: You start at the beginning here, right at the bottom of the layer, the hardware layer.

516
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:10,633
Scott: If you're using a wire and someone wants to spy on your shit, they have to.

517
00:30:10,693 --> 00:30:13,040
Scott: either they need physical access to that wire.

518
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:16,000
Scott: They got to cut it and put computers in between it or who knows.

519
00:30:16,582 --> 00:30:18,940
Scott: And that already provides you with physical security.

520
00:30:19,021 --> 00:30:22,000
Scott: For Wi-Fi, there is no physical security.

521
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,880
Scott: Your computer, all the bits that your computer is sending.

522
00:30:25,301 --> 00:30:29,020
Scott: So, you know, the password that you just typed in that you then push submit.

523
00:30:29,321 --> 00:30:35,360
Rym: They're going out in a three dimensional sphere of electromagnetic radiation.

524
00:30:35,946 --> 00:30:36,959
Rym: That is just the bits.

525
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:37,300
Scott: Yeah.

526
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:44,160
Scott: Your computer turns that into bits and broadcast it out into the air where anyone can touch it with their antenna if they're close enough.

527
00:30:44,521 --> 00:30:57,480
Scott: And likewise, all the shit you're downloading, you know, all the porn you're watching, the GeekNights you're listening to is being broadcast by the router near you into the air and everyone can look at it.

528
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,160
Scott: So how the fuck do we deal with that?

529
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,360
Scott: And the answer is lots of encryption.

530
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:07,360
Rym: So it's interesting because there are unencrypted wireless protocols.

531
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:07,903
Scott: Yeah, you could.

532
00:31:07,923 --> 00:31:09,839
Scott: you don't have to use encryption if you don't want to.

533
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,959
Scott: And maybe there are cases where you don't want to.

534
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,085
Rym: Now, think of it like just what.

535
00:31:13,145 --> 00:31:16,140
Rym: it's the same concerns as with wired in that regard.

536
00:31:16,502 --> 00:31:19,820
Rym: Like in the old days, networks were one big open network.

537
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:23,719
Rym: So wired networks were a lot like modern day wireless networks.

538
00:31:24,543 --> 00:31:27,100
Rym: And if someone had a packet sniffer, they could literally see anything.

539
00:31:27,161 --> 00:31:29,299
Rym: So packet sniffers were a big security deal.

540
00:31:29,862 --> 00:31:32,920
Rym: But the practical reality is that in the modern world, everyone switched.

541
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,815
Scott: There's no hubs anymore.

542
00:31:33,856 --> 00:31:33,958
Rym: Yep.

543
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:47,260
Rym: As we move to bridge and then switched ethernet, effectively, every device is communicating with one other device in a single point to point bidirectional link that is not shared by anyone else.

544
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:47,520
Scott: Right.

545
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:57,080
Scott: So if you wanted to see other people's traffic on a wired ethernet network, at least you would have to like physically mess with something to get the router, the switch to send you their bits.

546
00:31:57,543 --> 00:31:57,785
Rym: Yep.

547
00:31:58,308 --> 00:32:00,000
Scott: And before this, everyone sees everyone bits.

548
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:00,481
Scott: I'm a guy.

549
00:32:00,722 --> 00:32:05,080
Rym: And before any of the vampire tabs, because someone mentioned vampire taps to me recently one.

550
00:32:05,584 --> 00:32:06,980
Rym: No, that's not a thing anymore.

551
00:32:07,341 --> 00:32:07,622
Rym: No.

552
00:32:07,783 --> 00:32:11,120
Rym: In fact, that was barely a thing when I was still in college.

553
00:32:11,282 --> 00:32:12,218
Rym: Yeah, I've used them.

554
00:32:12,721 --> 00:32:14,979
Rym: I've used 10 base five and 10 base two.

555
00:32:15,341 --> 00:32:15,724
Rym: Guess what?

556
00:32:15,724 --> 00:32:17,517
Rym: 10 base five and 10 base two are gone.

557
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:18,363
Scott: Yep.

558
00:32:18,935 --> 00:32:19,200
Rym: Anyway.

559
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:19,741
Rym: Yeah.

560
00:32:20,342 --> 00:32:26,160
Rym: So wireless networks need to ostensibly encrypt the data so people can't just sniff on it.

561
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:41,340
Rym: So the earliest ways to encrypt data on a wireless network was to use something called, well, effectively, a group key group symmetric encryption of some kind, meaning there is a encryption key that can be used for that network and everyone on the network shares that key.

562
00:32:42,041 --> 00:32:47,900
Rym: So if you're connected to the network, you can see everyone else's bits who is also connected to the network.

563
00:32:48,322 --> 00:32:51,880
Rym: But someone who doesn't have that key can't connect and can't see anything right now.

564
00:32:51,920 --> 00:33:09,740
Scott: This could be considered to be OK, because if you have permission, you know, as long as everyone trustworthy has the key and no one shares it, you know, wrongly and it's a well generated key in a well and cryptographically secure key, you know, it's like, well, listen, you're all allowed in this company network and you're allowed in the wired part of it.

565
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,760
Scott: And you could see everything on the wired part anyway.

566
00:33:12,162 --> 00:33:14,519
Scott: So you may as well let you see everything in the wireless part, too.

567
00:33:15,041 --> 00:33:17,780
Scott: It's not like anyone can sit outside our company and spy on us.

568
00:33:17,861 --> 00:33:18,519
Scott: It's all encrypted.

569
00:33:19,322 --> 00:33:25,700
Rym: Now, the main reason this wasn't a concern is that for a long time, not many people used wireless ethernet.

570
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:32,180
Scott: Yeah, it's not like people in those days, these olden days had Wi-Fi and every single device they own and were using it for everything.

571
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:35,460
Scott: It was only, you know, certain people who could afford specialized equipment.

572
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:40,300
Rym: It was usually corporate environments where that kind of trust environment existed.

573
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,780
Scott: So that's not the way.

574
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,939
Scott: Companies had laptops with Wi-Fi and schools had it before people had it.

575
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:46,362
Scott: Yep.

576
00:33:46,825 --> 00:33:48,860
Rym: So nowadays that is not the case.

577
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,419
Scott: Everyone has Wi-Fi for everything now.

578
00:33:51,201 --> 00:33:56,860
Rym: Not only is Wi-Fi ubiquitous, but Wi-Fi is used on untrusted networks.

579
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,340
Rym: Wi-Fi is used in public places.

580
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,040
Scott: It's used everywhere on earth.

581
00:34:01,409 --> 00:34:01,620
Rym: Yep.

582
00:34:01,781 --> 00:34:03,620
Scott: Not just in one particular place.

583
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:07,700
Rym: It's also used in environments that need high security.

584
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:11,779
Rym: Like, for example, POS's point of sale systems.

585
00:34:12,221 --> 00:34:17,080
Rym: So like a cash register in the modern era pretty much has to be connected to the Internet or it won't work.

586
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,060
Rym: And it's not like you're connected to and a network of some kind.

587
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:21,219
Scott: Right.

588
00:34:21,241 --> 00:34:25,440
Scott: I mean, think about any place that's like a place of business, a store, a restaurant.

589
00:34:25,801 --> 00:34:25,942
Scott: Right.

590
00:34:25,962 --> 00:34:30,500
Scott: It's like people aren't wiring places up with ethernet in every place that there's a computer.

591
00:34:30,661 --> 00:34:30,860
Scott: Right.

592
00:34:31,081 --> 00:34:35,280
Scott: You got these like restaurants now where there's like an iPad on every table for you to order food with.

593
00:34:35,561 --> 00:34:38,620
Scott: You go to the airport, there's iPads like lined up on everything, right?

594
00:34:38,801 --> 00:34:39,022
Scott: Yeah.

595
00:34:39,103 --> 00:34:41,880
Scott: All these no one's wiring ethernet to all these things.

596
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,757
Scott: And a lot of these devices don't even have ethernet.

597
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,699
Scott: They're just all Wi-Fi only.

598
00:34:45,841 --> 00:34:46,163
Scott: Yeah.

599
00:34:46,204 --> 00:34:48,280
Scott: So there's Wi-Fi everywhere to support these things.

600
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,717
Scott: Any place you go, hotels or anywhere.

601
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:58,420
Scott: Usually you'll be able to see an SSID for the public Wi-Fi for you to use to get your Internet and a whole bunch of other secured ones.

602
00:34:58,902 --> 00:35:00,920
Scott: And those are for like the business to operate.

603
00:35:01,443 --> 00:35:03,280
Rym: You know, oh, my God, I found this simple website.

604
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,780
Rym: I was just looking for like a cheat sheet of all the different protocols.

605
00:35:06,561 --> 00:35:08,220
Rym: And there's one here that lists all of them.

606
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,970
Rym: And it has a fast facts, how it works.

607
00:35:10,071 --> 00:35:11,459
Rym: and should I use it?

608
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,359
Rym: And for WEP, it's just no, no, no, no.

609
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:19,200
Rym: So WEP was the first one that really existed as far as any of you will care.

610
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:19,480
Scott: Yeah.

611
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:23,620
Scott: This is the first one that like normal consumer people were using, whatever.

612
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:27,600
Rym: Like in the old days, if you said of wireless router, your choices were WEP or nothing.

613
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,062
Scott: Yeah.

614
00:35:28,103 --> 00:35:28,778
Scott: So we used WEP.

615
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:29,853
Rym: And you know what WEP stands for?

616
00:35:30,502 --> 00:35:31,539
Rym: I never knew until now.

617
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,760
Scott: Wireless encryption protocol.

618
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,780
Rym: Wireless equivalency privacy.

619
00:35:35,081 --> 00:35:41,520
Rym: Really meaning is equivalently as private as a wired network, wired equivalency privacy.

620
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:41,825
Rym: Oh, WEP.

621
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:43,462
Scott: But it's not.

622
00:35:44,046 --> 00:35:46,820
Rym: Well, so it ostensibly was the problem.

623
00:35:47,421 --> 00:35:52,947
Scott: Well, the first the first the practical problem with with WEP is that the keys could only contain hex values.

624
00:35:53,088 --> 00:35:57,579
Scott: So zero through nine and eight through F. And you can make them kind of long, which you should.

625
00:35:58,022 --> 00:35:59,500
Scott: And we made our as long as possible.

626
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:06,600
Scott: So ours was dead beef, dead beef, because you can spell that using only the letters A through F, followed by the number sixty nine, nine times.

627
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,043
Scott: Nice.

628
00:36:07,893 --> 00:36:08,459
Rym: Nine times.

629
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:09,599
Rym: So it was dead beef.

630
00:36:09,881 --> 00:36:10,223
Rym: Nice.

631
00:36:10,908 --> 00:36:12,459
Rym: X nine is how you could remember that.

632
00:36:12,701 --> 00:36:13,004
Rym: Right.

633
00:36:13,267 --> 00:36:14,540
Rym: And that was what we came up with.

634
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,880
Scott: And we used it because that's all there was in those days.

635
00:36:17,061 --> 00:36:28,659
Scott: And the problem and the other reason we used WEP, even after we knew WEP was dead, is that certain devices, for example, the original Nintendo DS only supported WEP and WEP is still better than nothing.

636
00:36:29,741 --> 00:36:34,823
Scott: So even after the days where I knew we shouldn't have WEP, I made a separate subnetwork.

637
00:36:34,863 --> 00:36:35,768
Scott: that was WEP only.

638
00:36:35,828 --> 00:36:38,180
Scott: that was separated from everything else.

639
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:42,320
Scott: Couldn't get to the internal biz just so our DSS could still connect to the Internet.

640
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:47,540
Rym: So of all the issues with WEP, they're they're all kind of moot.

641
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,539
Rym: So we don't need to talk about like the pros and cons.

642
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,429
Scott: You use WEP and someone wants to.

643
00:36:51,489 --> 00:36:53,540
Scott: they can just break it and see everything and do it.

644
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,343
Rym: That's it.

645
00:36:54,664 --> 00:37:00,640
Rym: In like 2001, I want to say someone was just like, oh, here is a method to reliably attack WEP and gain access.

646
00:37:00,741 --> 00:37:01,143
Rym: The end.

647
00:37:01,283 --> 00:37:06,200
Scott: You can just get software for free from the Internet and put it on your laptop and walk around that you find a web network.

648
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:11,020
Scott: You can not only connect to it, but spy on everything everyone's doing on it wirelessly.

649
00:37:11,221 --> 00:37:11,482
Rym: Yeah.

650
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:14,820
Scott: So don't use WEP unless you are making a honeypot.

651
00:37:15,021 --> 00:37:16,046
Rym: So WEP had problems.

652
00:37:16,146 --> 00:37:19,120
Scott: And independently of that, you really want to get your DS online.

653
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:19,683
Scott: Yeah.

654
00:37:19,784 --> 00:37:24,519
Scott: And in which case, you better know what you're doing to make sure you don't accidentally have any important data going over that web.

655
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:24,981
Rym: Yeah.

656
00:37:25,001 --> 00:37:25,524
Rym: It's very funny.

657
00:37:25,564 --> 00:37:28,503
Rym: All these sites I'm going to don't actually describe how WEP works anywhere.

658
00:37:28,544 --> 00:37:30,240
Rym: They just described that it was broken.

659
00:37:30,442 --> 00:37:31,899
Scott: Yes, it's super broken, isn't it?

660
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:42,792
Scott: But the other thing is that not only are these security things used for encrypting the data going over the air so that no one can spy on you, they're also controlling access to the access point.

661
00:37:43,318 --> 00:37:43,460
Scott: Right.

662
00:37:43,521 --> 00:37:45,580
Scott: Like you type your password in to connect to the router.

663
00:37:46,044 --> 00:37:47,640
Scott: You go, oh, what's the Wi-Fi password?

664
00:37:48,082 --> 00:37:48,303
Scott: Right.

665
00:37:48,464 --> 00:37:50,960
Scott: That's also part of WEP or WPA.

666
00:37:51,501 --> 00:37:51,722
Scott: Right.

667
00:37:51,762 --> 00:38:02,159
Scott: So, yeah, WEP is not only broken, meaning, hey, you can get spied on, but also WEP being broken means if you enable WEP on your router, someone can come and use your Internet and use all your bandwidth.

668
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:02,581
Scott: Yep.

669
00:38:03,003 --> 00:38:08,019
Scott: So matters if you have limited bandwidth or someone's going to download stuff and your Internet is going to be all slow.

670
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:13,162
Rym: So WPA version one was an interim protocol because WEP was fucked and we needed something.

671
00:38:13,342 --> 00:38:13,523
Rym: Right.

672
00:38:13,543 --> 00:38:18,560
Rym: So WPA2 is just the final modern version of WPA effectively.

673
00:38:19,242 --> 00:38:23,440
Rym: So as far as you're concerned, WPA2 is the only one that is used right.

674
00:38:23,521 --> 00:38:25,216
Scott: There's no reason to use WPA1.

675
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,500
Scott: I've never seen a device in my life that only supports WPA1 and not two.

676
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,617
Scott: I see things that support WEP only, mainly the Nintendo DS.

677
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:36,840
Scott: Yeah, but I've never seen anything that supports WPA1 and not two.

678
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:40,040
Scott: So there's no reason to use one or enable one or whatever.

679
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:40,988
Scott: Just use two only.

680
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,220
Scott: Pretend one doesn't exist.

681
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,278
Scott: I don't even know why it's there.

682
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:44,381
Scott: I don't know.

683
00:38:45,624 --> 00:38:49,816
Scott: Anyway, so what does WPA2 do that WEP does wrong?

684
00:38:52,101 --> 00:38:52,838
Scott: It fucking works.

685
00:38:55,464 --> 00:38:59,060
Rym: So WPA2 has a fundamental vulnerability.

686
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,500
Scott: Well, that we only discovered today.

687
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:14,042
Rym: And this is shocking because the vulnerability is so simple that it like one, I'm sure that there are a lot of people who've been exploiting this for a long time and we didn't know.

688
00:39:14,204 --> 00:39:15,579
Scott: Well, it was discovered months ago.

689
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:22,579
Rym: No, I am confident that at least some state actors have probably been using this vulnerability for a long time.

690
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:23,260
Scott: Quite possibly.

691
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:27,040
Rym: Because this vulnerability has existed for as long as WPA2 is existing.

692
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:27,361
Scott: Right.

693
00:39:27,381 --> 00:39:33,040
Scott: It's not something that's like wrong with some routers or some software, some OS's, although some are worse than others.

694
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:36,180
Rym: Yeah, like Linux is extra fucked compared to Windows.

695
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,740
Scott: I got an Ubuntu patch WPA supplicant today.

696
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:39,261
Rym: So, yep.

697
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:42,740
Rym: But like Linux is just way worse affected than Windows.

698
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,720
Scott: Well, it wasn't a problem actually in the Linux kernel.

699
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:49,940
Scott: It's a problem with WPA supplicant, which is the open source WPA thing.

700
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:50,281
Rym: Yep.

701
00:39:50,984 --> 00:39:55,700
Scott: Anyway, anyway, so here's the is the vulnerability that was discovered.

702
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:55,921
Scott: Right.

703
00:39:55,961 --> 00:39:59,780
Scott: So the way WPA2 works is that this is four way handshake.

704
00:39:59,942 --> 00:40:00,125
Scott: Right.

705
00:40:00,145 --> 00:40:01,260
Scott: Because you want to do this encryption.

706
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,083
Scott: That's really good.

707
00:40:02,103 --> 00:40:16,559
Scott: And it's actually the encryption that it uses has mathematical proofs guaranteeing that it's not going to get broken except by brute force, which is, you know, pretty impossible because by the time they brute force it, your Wi-Fi session is done and you're going to somewhere else with a different key.

708
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:16,881
Scott: Right.

709
00:40:16,901 --> 00:40:17,062
Scott: Yep.

710
00:40:17,924 --> 00:40:18,125
Scott: So

711
00:40:18,406 --> 00:40:31,240
Rym: the an important point to kind of bring up is that pretty much all encryption in a practical sense, like all the data that's actually being encrypted and almost every protocol you'll ever use uses symmetric keys, meaning both sides have the same key, which

712
00:40:31,624 --> 00:40:32,940
Scott: so basically you do this handshake.

713
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:42,480
Scott: And what happens during the handshake is you and the router cooperate to make a key and you end up making the same key and you encrypt and decrypt everything using that key.

714
00:40:42,801 --> 00:40:50,040
Scott: The reason for that, no one else using the same Wi-Fi or is using the same key and they probably won't because every time you connect, you make a new key.

715
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:59,299
Rym: Now, the reason for this is that public private key not only provides a way to encrypt data transfer, but it proves who you are.

716
00:40:59,883 --> 00:41:01,919
Rym: You can prove that you are the person you say you are.

717
00:41:03,181 --> 00:41:15,522
Rym: So the drawback is that asymmetric encryption like that takes a relatively huge amount of computing resources to actually transmit encrypted data and then decode that data and vice versa.

718
00:41:15,904 --> 00:41:20,642
Scott: And also you have to somehow get your public key onto the router and vice versa.

719
00:41:20,782 --> 00:41:27,320
Rym: You can like a key exchange, but you can send your public key in the clear because by definition, public keys are not secret.

720
00:41:27,702 --> 00:41:27,923
Rym: Right.

721
00:41:28,063 --> 00:41:31,100
Rym: The whole point is that I can give you a public key in the clear.

722
00:41:31,443 --> 00:41:32,739
Rym: I can broadcast it to the world.

723
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:37,762
Rym: You give me the same broadcast to the world and anyone who got both those keys can't do shit with them.

724
00:41:39,327 --> 00:41:43,580
Rym: But because this is so computationally expensive, you only use that.

725
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:47,382
Scott: Your Wi-Fi would be kind of slow because your CPU would have to work overtime to do that encryption.

726
00:41:47,502 --> 00:41:51,700
Scott: So we need easier encryption so Wi-Fi doesn't get ridiculously slow.

727
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:52,101
Rym: Yep.

728
00:41:52,161 --> 00:41:53,487
Rym: So the problem is symmetric key.

729
00:41:53,808 --> 00:41:57,123
Rym: is that the key that we share, we both have to agree on the same key.

730
00:41:57,987 --> 00:42:01,100
Rym: And if anyone else finds out that key, we're hosed.

731
00:42:01,481 --> 00:42:07,724
Rym: So you use the asymmetric encryption to generate and share the key that you'll then actually use.

732
00:42:07,985 --> 00:42:12,403
Rym: You never actually send that key any other time except during that handshake.

733
00:42:12,484 --> 00:42:12,665
Scott: Right.

734
00:42:12,685 --> 00:42:27,460
Scott: But anyway, so here's what happens, right, is this is handshaking process that we're not going to explain the details of in which your computer or phone or iPad and the router that your access point you're connecting to negotiate the shared key you're going to use for this session only.

735
00:42:28,181 --> 00:42:31,799
Scott: And then all the further data you send between each other is going to use that key.

736
00:42:32,202 --> 00:42:36,104
Scott: And now no one else using that access point or anyone else around is going to read any of that data.

737
00:42:36,165 --> 00:42:37,639
Scott: But here's the thing.

738
00:42:38,281 --> 00:42:44,820
Scott: That handshake part, you're not sending anything during the handshake part that will allow anyone to break the encryption.

739
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,060
Scott: The encryption itself cannot be broken.

740
00:42:47,821 --> 00:42:55,798
Scott: What can be done is tricking one or both sides into using a different key is basically one part of the handshake.

741
00:42:56,524 --> 00:42:57,152
Scott: It's wireless.

742
00:42:57,192 --> 00:42:57,840
Scott: It's not reliable.

743
00:42:58,002 --> 00:42:58,224
Scott: Right.

744
00:42:58,568 --> 00:42:59,620
Scott: So they're writing the protocol.

745
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:05,460
Scott: They're like, oh, yeah, if this doesn't get sent or whatever, just send it again because, you know, it might mess up.

746
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:07,240
Scott: You had to send it multiple times just in case.

747
00:43:08,163 --> 00:43:08,404
Scott: Right.

748
00:43:08,424 --> 00:43:15,139
Scott: So the third part of the handshake, it's a four way handshake, is the part where it sends basically this nonce key thing.

749
00:43:15,641 --> 00:43:17,960
Rym: A nonce is a actually random number.

750
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:23,800
Rym: This is the simple way to think about it that you use to initialize or sort of set a key.

751
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:24,677
Rym: It's not the key.

752
00:43:25,141 --> 00:43:30,146
Rym: It is a component to generate a key such that the key is unlikely to be able to be reverse engineered.

753
00:43:30,267 --> 00:43:31,499
Rym: There's a lot of reasons why you use nonce.

754
00:43:31,661 --> 00:43:32,867
Scott: Regardless, you can.

755
00:43:32,967 --> 00:43:36,252
Scott: what you can do is first you establish a man in the middle relationship.

756
00:43:36,557 --> 00:43:36,740
Scott: Right.

757
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:43,082
Scott: So the way one way you can do this would be to set up an identical Wi-Fi access point on a different channel.

758
00:43:44,006 --> 00:43:49,480
Scott: And then you trick, say, someone's iPad and connecting to you and you forward their traffic to the router.

759
00:43:50,303 --> 00:43:51,680
Scott: Big deal if you do this right.

760
00:43:51,800 --> 00:44:00,644
Scott: Nobody cares because what you're getting encrypted data from an iPad, sending it to where it's supposed to go and then receiving encrypted data from the router and sending it back to the iPad.

761
00:44:00,967 --> 00:44:02,700
Scott: The iPad thinks the Internet's working fine.

762
00:44:03,003 --> 00:44:04,439
Scott: You're not stealing any info.

763
00:44:04,805 --> 00:44:05,596
Scott: Who gives a shit?

764
00:44:05,678 --> 00:44:05,840
Scott: Right.

765
00:44:05,901 --> 00:44:07,880
Scott: So we don't care if someone does that, whatever.

766
00:44:09,001 --> 00:44:09,603
Scott: But here's the thing.

767
00:44:10,326 --> 00:44:19,708
Scott: I'm intercepting the handshaky part and the handshaky part just to change a little bit here and resend the handshaky part a few times after it already happened.

768
00:44:20,196 --> 00:44:20,420
Scott: Right.

769
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:25,120
Rym: Because then what is it forces you to use a known nonce, I believe is the vulnerability.

770
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:25,681
Scott: Exactly.

771
00:44:25,721 --> 00:44:31,939
Scott: So now I know what your nonce is and I've made you use my nonce and I already know what the key is going to be and such.

772
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:36,980
Rym: Now, I think it's that this is where it's worse with Linux, because in Linux it always goes to all zeros.

773
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:40,677
Scott: Yeah, there was the bug in WPA supplicant that was just fixed because I got the.

774
00:44:41,059 --> 00:44:42,084
Scott: I saw the patch today.

775
00:44:43,169 --> 00:44:45,640
Scott: It already got deployed on a lot of Linux distros.

776
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:46,719
Scott: Yeah, fixes that.

777
00:44:47,001 --> 00:44:52,673
Scott: But yeah, without that patch, including other Linux devices like your Android phones, it's going to be all zeros.

778
00:44:53,801 --> 00:44:54,932
Scott: So dirt better better.

779
00:44:56,781 --> 00:45:03,063
Scott: Anyway, once you do this, you can now decrypt all the Wi-Fi traffic between the device and the router.

780
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:07,600
Scott: So that might not be too bad, actually, because they're just sniffing.

781
00:45:07,801 --> 00:45:10,340
Scott: How much stuff are you sending that's not encrypted?

782
00:45:10,502 --> 00:45:11,540
Rym: For example, let's see.

783
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:11,882
Rym: I'm on.

784
00:45:11,963 --> 00:45:13,356
Rym: every site I'm on right now is HTTPS.

785
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:17,520
Scott: So they're going to see a bunch of HTTPS traffic and graduations.

786
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:18,286
Scott: You see nothing.

787
00:45:18,347 --> 00:45:19,519
Scott: It's already encrypted again.

788
00:45:19,821 --> 00:45:27,880
Rym: And remember, even if they see the handshake, because HTTPS also uses symmetric keys, it only uses the asymmetric keys to initially change the keys.

789
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:30,360
Rym: Everything that piece is also encrypted.

790
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:30,661
Scott: Right.

791
00:45:30,681 --> 00:45:36,939
Scott: So they can see anything that you're sending that's not encrypted, which they could already see anyway if they're out on the Internet because it's not encrypted.

792
00:45:37,524 --> 00:45:38,899
Scott: But what else could they do?

793
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:46,700
Rym: Well, well, this is where it gets complicated, because what they can do depends on what specific handshake algorithm you're using.

794
00:45:46,921 --> 00:45:47,162
Scott: Right.

795
00:45:47,463 --> 00:45:52,542
Scott: Also, what you can do depends on how clever you are, what other settings are on the network.

796
00:45:52,643 --> 00:45:54,780
Rym: So I believe most people use AES.

797
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:55,641
Scott: Yes.

798
00:45:56,344 --> 00:45:58,070
Rym: So that's the one that we should probably talk about.

799
00:45:58,131 --> 00:46:02,320
Scott: is that WPA2 can be used with different encryption mechanisms.

800
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:04,177
Rym: And there's one one you're using is AES.

801
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,400
Scott: Don't use the TKIP, but don't use the other one.

802
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:08,491
Rym: So apparently there's a GCMP.

803
00:46:08,531 --> 00:46:10,060
Rym: is the one I didn't actually know anything about.

804
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,120
Scott: I never heard of it before today.

805
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:12,499
Rym: Galois counter mode protocol.

806
00:46:12,722 --> 00:46:14,380
Rym: And I just learned a lot about it.

807
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:15,169
Rym: It's kind of fascinating.

808
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:15,899
Rym: We'll get back to that.

809
00:46:16,101 --> 00:46:17,808
Rym: Because that one you're super fucked.

810
00:46:18,672 --> 00:46:21,063
Rym: as opposed to a yes, we're just kind of regular fucked.

811
00:46:21,725 --> 00:46:24,214
Rym: So with a yes, they can definitely snoop all your.

812
00:46:24,736 --> 00:46:27,859
Rym: I'll quote this article because this is much better research than what I'm doing.

813
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:38,180
Rym: An attacker can decrypt network packets, making it possible to read their contents, and they can inject malicious content into TCP packet streams.

814
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,200
Scott: Yeah, because I mean, they're man in the middle now.

815
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:40,663
Scott: So they can.

816
00:46:40,764 --> 00:46:43,120
Scott: you know, you're visiting a website and the JPEG comes along.

817
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:44,240
Rym: Well, they're not a full man in the middle.

818
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:51,702
Rym: They can not forge messages, so they cannot pretend to be the person that they attack.

819
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:55,868
Scott: No, but if you're if you're receiving a JPEG from a website, I'll just replace that JPEG.

820
00:46:55,909 --> 00:46:56,195
Scott: Go see.

821
00:46:57,385 --> 00:46:57,773
Scott: And I'll go.

822
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,239
Scott: He shows up on Google.com instead of the Google logo.

823
00:47:00,841 --> 00:47:05,120
Rym: Yeah, but they so basically quote the key itself cannot be broken or forged.

824
00:47:05,522 --> 00:47:08,040
Rym: So the attacker cannot forge a key and join the network.

825
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:10,760
Rym: Instead, they have to use the cloned access point.

826
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:13,899
Rym: They use the same MAC address as the access point of the targeted network.

827
00:47:14,121 --> 00:47:14,302
Rym: Right.

828
00:47:14,342 --> 00:47:15,146
Scott: You don't know what.

829
00:47:15,206 --> 00:47:17,820
Scott: you still don't know what like what the WPA password is.

830
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:19,240
Scott: You can't connect to the router.

831
00:47:19,702 --> 00:47:22,600
Scott: All you're doing is looking at all the data that's going back and forth.

832
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:30,079
Rym: That is why my news about Estonia is so devastating, because in that one, you can derive the actual key.

833
00:47:30,381 --> 00:47:30,522
Scott: Right.

834
00:47:30,582 --> 00:47:32,880
Scott: This isn't a case where the encryption itself is broken.

835
00:47:33,341 --> 00:47:39,464
Scott: It's a case where somebody forced you to use a shitty key so that they can see what they get.

836
00:47:39,484 --> 00:47:42,960
Rym: The handshake is broken, compromising the session key.

837
00:47:43,101 --> 00:47:45,700
Rym: The symmetric key used for just that conversation.

838
00:47:45,921 --> 00:47:46,486
Scott: Yeah, I didn't.

839
00:47:46,547 --> 00:47:47,860
Scott: I didn't unlock your lock.

840
00:47:48,341 --> 00:47:51,719
Scott: I made it so that the key to your house is now a flat key with no bumps on it.

841
00:47:51,921 --> 00:47:52,063
Rym: Yeah.

842
00:47:52,346 --> 00:47:53,318
Scott: And then I opened the door.

843
00:47:54,202 --> 00:47:55,640
Scott: It's still a perfectly secure lock.

844
00:47:55,861 --> 00:47:56,979
Scott: Your key is just really stupid.

845
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:01,282
Rym: So if you're using TKIP, which if you're in a corporate environment, they might have like set it up.

846
00:48:01,504 --> 00:48:07,060
Rym: There's a lot of reasons why people use TKIP, but I don't I don't want to get into the details of TKIP because I don't know them offhand anymore.

847
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:12,360
Rym: The message integrity code can actually be recovered.

848
00:48:13,141 --> 00:48:16,320
Rym: This allows them to replay captured packets to the network.

849
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:23,462
Rym: They can also forge and transmit entirely new packets to the targeted client from the access point.

850
00:48:23,482 --> 00:48:27,865
Rym: So they cannot pretend to be you, but they can pretend to be the person you're talking to.

851
00:48:28,669 --> 00:48:30,700
Rym: Now, they can't break the HTTPS.

852
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:38,463
Rym: However, you can't inject legitimate data into an HTTPS stream because you don't know the encryption.

853
00:48:38,523 --> 00:48:38,764
Rym: Right.

854
00:48:38,784 --> 00:48:43,940
Scott: If you're using a VPN, let's say that would is still on another level, be another layer of encryption.

855
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:46,000
Scott: They wouldn't see anything you're doing.

856
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:48,879
Scott: They'd see just a VPN connection and they'd have to break that, too.

857
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:50,184
Scott: Well, they probably couldn't.

858
00:48:50,244 --> 00:48:55,695
Scott: However, some things don't go over the VPN, like, say, the DHCP negotiation.

859
00:48:55,735 --> 00:48:56,179
Scott: that happens.

860
00:48:56,881 --> 00:49:04,343
Scott: So what they can do is you could during the DHCP process, you forge some packets or inject.

861
00:49:04,785 --> 00:49:08,160
Scott: You could trick someone's computer into using a different DNS server.

862
00:49:08,642 --> 00:49:12,733
Scott: And now suddenly you send in all sorts of weird websites instead of the ones you're trying to go to.

863
00:49:13,521 --> 00:49:13,802
Rym: Yeah.

864
00:49:13,822 --> 00:49:19,760
Rym: Or you can do just like force them off the network and then try to reconnect as them, depending on what mode, like what to reconnect is them.

865
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:21,499
Scott: You would need to get the WPA password.

866
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:31,259
Rym: So let's go down one layer more because GCMP, which I didn't know a lot about until just now, is not commonly used, but I've never seen a route that has it.

867
00:49:31,701 --> 00:49:42,119
Rym: So I'm going to read a quote from the article, given that GCMP is expected to be adopted at a high rate in the next few years under the WIGIG name, W-I-G-I-G.

868
00:49:43,164 --> 00:49:44,620
Rym: This is a worrying situation.

869
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:59,119
Rym: So apparently GCMP, the Galois counter mode protocol, the benefit of using it over AES is that it has the same level of cryptographic reliability, meaning it is just as mathematically secure.

870
00:49:59,240 --> 00:49:59,619
Rym: That's good.

871
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:04,380
Rym: This exchange, but it is way less computationally intensive.

872
00:50:04,481 --> 00:50:06,960
Rym: It is super efficient and super fast.

873
00:50:08,562 --> 00:50:16,358
Rym: And for reasons I don't want to get into, it allows parallel encryption and decryption because one one block of data is not.

874
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:18,919
Scott: So you can basically do it better when you have more cores.

875
00:50:19,404 --> 00:50:19,606
Rym: Yeah.

876
00:50:19,747 --> 00:50:20,919
Scott: Or modern computers do.

877
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:30,020
Rym: Or if you have an access point or some piece of hardware, you can have a hardware chip that does encryption in parallel and save power, save CPU cycles.

878
00:50:30,141 --> 00:50:30,566
Rym: That's good.

879
00:50:30,931 --> 00:50:31,640
Rym: Yeah, it's great.

880
00:50:32,163 --> 00:50:35,139
Rym: The problem is it's for now, this is what I don't understand.

881
00:50:36,021 --> 00:50:45,859
Rym: Something about the way the GCMP system works means that if the nonce is known, GCMP gets extra fucked.

882
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:50,600
Rym: So, quote, it is possible to replay and decrypt packets.

883
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:56,060
Rym: Additionally, it is possible to recover the authentication key, which is GCMPs.

884
00:50:56,782 --> 00:51:00,580
Rym: Connect to your Wi-Fi is used to protect communications in both directions.

885
00:51:01,361 --> 00:51:06,499
Scott: So you can actually find out if someone connects to your Wi-Fi, they can now access your private network resources.

886
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:09,615
Rym: They can forge packets to you and from you.

887
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:18,459
Scott: Like if you connected to my Wi-Fi, got my Wi-Fi password, you can start deleting stuff off my NAS or I could connect or you're connected to your Wi-Fi.

888
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:23,000
Rym: I can connect to your Wi-Fi and pretend to be you connecting to websites.

889
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:30,107
Rym: So, yeah, this is horrifying and it's probably not going to be fixed in a lot of places.

890
00:51:30,168 --> 00:51:30,840
Scott: A lot of route.

891
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:37,660
Scott: You basically have to update router firmwares and also, you know, device firmwares, devices and routers that are not maintained by the manufacturer.

892
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:43,079
Scott: Anything with Wi-Fi, anything, every single Wi-Fi device you own needs a patch to its software or firmware.

893
00:51:43,302 --> 00:51:45,420
Scott: And a lot of them are just never going to be patched.

894
00:51:45,521 --> 00:51:46,740
Scott: Even ones that have patches.

895
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:50,663
Scott: What it's like, you think your local restaurant is going to update its router firmware?

896
00:51:50,683 --> 00:51:53,720
Scott: No, they don't even know about this, even though it's all over the news.

897
00:51:54,061 --> 00:52:02,040
Scott: And then what's going to happen is, I guess, until they buy a new point of sale system, every credit card they swipe, somebody could sit in that restaurant and look at all of them.

898
00:52:02,301 --> 00:52:02,582
Rym: Yep.

899
00:52:02,903 --> 00:52:08,860
Rym: Internet of Things devices, point of sale devices, internal network devices that are used by companies.

900
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:12,320
Scott: Now, the bad the bad news is that it's affecting every Wi-Fi everywhere.

901
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:14,680
Scott: The good news is that you have to do it.

902
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:17,220
Scott: You can't just suddenly do attack everywhere.

903
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:31,638
Scott: You have to do specific attacks on a specific access points and specific devices, meaning if you run a network, you got to worry about this a lot physically be close enough to the place you're attacking within Wi-Fi range with your computer, specifically trying to do this.

904
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:32,202
Scott: Yeah.

905
00:52:32,222 --> 00:52:32,564
Scott: Right.

906
00:52:32,644 --> 00:52:36,023
Scott: So it's not like I can just suddenly, you know, fuck everyone on the whole Internet.

907
00:52:36,043 --> 00:52:39,199
Scott: Right now, with SSL, there is an interesting thing.

908
00:52:39,881 --> 00:52:41,033
Scott: Most if you can.

909
00:52:41,275 --> 00:52:41,700
Rym: Oh, yeah.

910
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:42,604
Rym: I forgot about that part.

911
00:52:42,624 --> 00:52:50,440
Scott: If you properly configure your SSL website with a thing called HSTS, that means let's say you visit Google dot com.

912
00:52:50,561 --> 00:52:50,742
Scott: Right.

913
00:52:51,025 --> 00:52:52,820
Scott: And you visit Google dot com with HTTPS.

914
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:59,383
Scott: The HSTS will tell your Web browser, yo, you see this Google dot com you just visited?

915
00:52:59,685 --> 00:53:01,516
Scott: Yeah, I just visited Google dot com with the SSL.

916
00:53:02,241 --> 00:53:03,170
Scott: It's all encrypted and shit.

917
00:53:03,191 --> 00:53:03,413
Scott: It's like.

918
00:53:03,473 --> 00:53:03,918
Scott: I know, bro.

919
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:11,641
Scott: But but the thing is, we know you and me that this Google right has HTTPS working, right?

920
00:53:11,843 --> 00:53:12,106
Scott: Yeah.

921
00:53:12,186 --> 00:53:12,348
Scott: Yeah.

922
00:53:12,368 --> 00:53:13,559
Scott: We know we're using it right now.

923
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:17,020
Scott: That's why we're having this encrypted conversation to be safe.

924
00:53:17,901 --> 00:53:20,378
Scott: Never talk to Google again unless it's HTTPS.

925
00:53:20,901 --> 00:53:23,720
Scott: Do not talk to Google again with HTTP ever.

926
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:24,542
Scott: Don't do it.

927
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:32,160
Rym: Now, a lot of websites, for good reasons, will gracefully fail to non encrypted traffic if SSL that will TLS doesn't work.

928
00:53:32,301 --> 00:53:33,516
Scott: No, that's not what happens at all.

929
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:36,040
Rym: Are you talking about the vulnerability specifically?

930
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:36,480
Scott: No.

931
00:53:36,721 --> 00:53:43,900
Scott: So the what HSTS is, is that is that thing which says, yo, Web browser never talked to me unencrypted ever again.

932
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:51,900
Scott: And the Web browser says, OK, I promise I will never talk to this domain again without SSL because I know that that domain has SSL that works.

933
00:53:52,481 --> 00:53:56,340
Scott: And it sent me the HSTS thing, which told me never talk to it again.

934
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:10,120
Scott: But meaning if it tries to talk to you unencrypted, right, if your Web browser, if you then go into your Web browser and type in HTTP, Google dot com without an S, it'll just switch to S. because HSTS said never use you never use non S with me.

935
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:13,440
Rym: And if S is really blocked or broken in some way, it just won't let you connect.

936
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:17,842
Scott: It won't let you connect to that website because because the Web server configured HSTS.

937
00:54:17,923 --> 00:54:24,364
Rym: Now, it'd be like if every time I came to Scott's house, I said, don't open the door for me unless I say this magic code right now and then I come and don't say the code.

938
00:54:24,526 --> 00:54:25,680
Rym: You ain't opening the door right now.

939
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:29,839
Scott: Let's say that this website, you know, doesn't use HSTS.

940
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:32,200
Scott: They configured their SSL wrong.

941
00:54:32,641 --> 00:54:43,519
Scott: That means you can visit that website with us or without us, whichever one you like and your Web browser won't refuse, even though it once visited with us and they have us set up and you think you're encrypted.

942
00:54:44,062 --> 00:54:49,888
Scott: You know, when you visit the next time, you could not use S and the website will still work and your browser doesn't care because it doesn't have HSTS turned on.

943
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:57,262
Rym: There were a lot of reasons why that was common, but there's no need for that in the modern era.

944
00:54:57,342 --> 00:55:03,100
Scott: So the person who configured that website, the Web, you know, that company right, say Twitter, Twitter has it correct.

945
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,679
Scott: But let's say Twitter didn't have it correct.

946
00:55:05,121 --> 00:55:09,262
Scott: You visit Twitter of HTTPS one day and then your browser lets you visit without the next day.

947
00:55:09,282 --> 00:55:10,879
Scott: And you're not paying attention to the green lock.

948
00:55:11,403 --> 00:55:11,604
Scott: Right.

949
00:55:11,966 --> 00:55:14,400
Scott: So here's what can happen with this Wi-Fi vulnerability.

950
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:19,600
Scott: Someone does this Wi-Fi attack to the WPA and they get in between you and the router.

951
00:55:20,221 --> 00:55:28,160
Scott: And then what they do is they visit the Twitter or the Google and they handle all the SSL between them and the Google.

952
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:31,640
Rym: So as far as Twitter is concerned, you're a perfectly valid client, right?

953
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:33,860
Scott: Because this other person is the Twitter client.

954
00:55:34,261 --> 00:55:39,560
Scott: But then in between you and the evil person, you're not using SSL, right?

955
00:55:39,781 --> 00:55:44,722
Scott: You're sending unencrypted stuff to the attacker and they're using SSL to talk to the website.

956
00:55:45,203 --> 00:55:51,204
Scott: And now, because there's no HSTS, your browser is perfectly OK, not using HTTPS.

957
00:55:51,667 --> 00:55:54,964
Scott: And you weren't paying attention that you're visiting Twitter and there's no green lock.

958
00:55:55,547 --> 00:55:57,859
Scott: So you didn't realize it because you weren't looking it up there.

959
00:55:58,061 --> 00:55:58,404
Scott: Yeah.

960
00:55:58,444 --> 00:55:58,707
Scott: Right.

961
00:55:58,969 --> 00:56:00,140
Scott: The green lock would be gone.

962
00:56:00,422 --> 00:56:00,604
Scott: Right.

963
00:56:00,624 --> 00:56:02,340
Scott: So if you pay attention, you can protect yourself.

964
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:04,060
Rym: But Twitter would otherwise work fine.

965
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:05,799
Scott: But Twitter would otherwise work fine.

966
00:56:06,302 --> 00:56:11,420
Scott: So now the reason I notice the green lock missing and now they got you.

967
00:56:12,281 --> 00:56:19,598
Rym: And the broader reason why this works is that you can use asymmetric encryption to prove who both sides are.

968
00:56:20,161 --> 00:56:28,760
Rym: But in the way that the way that is used in the Web is me as a client or a browser use it to prove that the website I'm connecting to is who they say they are.

969
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,798
Rym: The website does not use it to prove that I am rimmed.

970
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:36,020
Rym: The website uses it to prove that I am still the same person who said hello earlier.

971
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:39,239
Rym: It doesn't care who I am and only cares that I'm still the same person.

972
00:56:40,061 --> 00:56:52,180
Rym: So as a result, it doesn't have any way to verify the real person on the other end, because if you tried to make every person on the Internet use a public key to prove who they are when they connect to websites, that would be a very bad situation.

973
00:56:53,160 --> 00:57:06,500
Scott: Anyway, so, yeah, this is if anyone wants to commit a targeted attack against Wi-Fi, you know, sit in a Starbucks and collect credit card numbers, you know, anything like that, it is very possible now.

974
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:13,723
Scott: So I recommend use a VPN and I recommend that you not try not to connect to any shady Wi-Fi.

975
00:57:13,844 --> 00:57:14,066
Scott: Yep.

976
00:57:14,428 --> 00:57:16,300
Scott: And use a VPN anyway.

977
00:57:17,121 --> 00:57:28,279
Scott: More importantly, and there is one piece of good news to your DNS and make it so that it always uses Google DNS and never the DNS the DTP server tells you to at least for your Wi-Fi, iPhone, iPad devices.

978
00:57:28,503 --> 00:57:29,560
Rym: But there is some good news.

979
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:40,700
Rym: If your device, your client device, like your phone, all your devices, but if your phone is patched, even if a Wi-Fi router is not patched, they cannot attack your session.

980
00:57:41,823 --> 00:57:42,044
Scott: Right.

981
00:57:42,064 --> 00:57:45,619
Scott: So make sure you patch everything you own, your phone, anything that has Wi-Fi.

982
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,860
Scott: Try to get a patch for it if you can, especially your router.

983
00:57:49,921 --> 00:57:50,102
Rym: Yep.

984
00:57:51,046 --> 00:57:54,260
Rym: The broader question is that people are really freaking out about this.

985
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:56,774
Rym: But I saw a great quote on Twitter from a security researcher.

986
00:57:56,795 --> 00:57:57,720
Rym: that really is important.

987
00:57:58,402 --> 00:58:05,319
Rym: If you are the kind of organization or person where security matters and you're freaking out about the zero day, you have Wi-Fi on.

988
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:05,965
Rym: No, no, no.

989
00:58:06,006 --> 00:58:06,980
Rym: There's a much broader question.

990
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:15,460
Rym: The idea that any given day a zero day could appear and you got to figure out what to do about it should be a standard operating procedure.

991
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:16,062
Scott: That's also.

992
00:58:16,082 --> 00:58:18,599
Rym: your meeting this morning should not have been, oh, God, what do I do?

993
00:58:19,161 --> 00:58:21,700
Rym: It should have been a crazy zero day happened.

994
00:58:21,961 --> 00:58:23,160
Rym: Let's do the procedure.

995
00:58:24,221 --> 00:58:30,342
Rym: So if you're blindsided and panicking about this, that's going to happen to you a lot in the future.

996
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:33,380
Scott: I think the procedure would be turn off Wi-Fi until we patch everything.

997
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:34,182
Scott: Yeah.

998
00:58:34,202 --> 00:58:39,698
Scott: And if your data is that important, your Equifax or something, you should turn off all your Wi-Fi until you fix it.

999
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:40,202
Rym: Yup.

1000
00:58:40,404 --> 00:58:42,079
Scott: Because Equifax didn't do shit.

1001
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:47,382
Rym: But the other broad point that is terrifying to me is that this attack is baby's first attack.

1002
00:58:47,422 --> 00:58:51,320
Rym: Like, oh, yeah, if I went like RIT, I took a class with Katsu.

1003
00:58:51,521 --> 00:58:52,385
Rym: We had to hack people like.

1004
00:58:52,666 --> 00:58:56,720
Rym: it was the hack people class, and we actually hacked against the computer security class.

1005
00:58:56,881 --> 00:58:57,737
Rym: That's how RIT did it.

1006
00:58:58,761 --> 00:59:07,740
Rym: The first thing I will do if I ever want to, like, break encryption on a protocol is try replaying handshakes to see if anything works.

1007
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:13,200
Rym: The fact that it's a handshake replay problem is ridiculous.

1008
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:15,620
Rym: Did no one test this in all these years?

1009
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:16,779
Rym: No one noticed this.

1010
00:59:17,102 --> 00:59:18,019
Rym: I cannot believe that.

1011
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:23,418
Rym: I'm so confident that intelligence organizations around the world have been using this for attacks for a long time.

1012
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:27,199
Rym: And I wonder who dropped the ball.

1013
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:28,601
Rym: Like, it's just.

1014
00:59:28,641 --> 00:59:33,677
Scott: it's crazy to me that the whole world and all the people who made WPA to know and notice this.

1015
00:59:33,941 --> 00:59:34,162
Rym: Yep.

1016
00:59:34,525 --> 00:59:36,600
Rym: No one ever, every router ever.

1017
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:39,959
Scott: Anyone who ever wrote a WPA to implementation ever.

1018
00:59:40,364 --> 00:59:40,587
Rym: Yeah.

1019
00:59:40,608 --> 00:59:41,299
Rym: Like no one knows.

1020
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:47,640
Scott: Like, hey, if I replay it like some one guy noticed and now the whole world freaks out.

1021
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:48,082
Scott: Yeah.

1022
00:59:48,343 --> 00:59:51,399
Rym: I mean, someone noticed the thing about how you can play.

1023
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:52,182
Scott: No, it's not.

1024
00:59:52,222 --> 00:59:54,739
Scott: I've never I've never written a WPA to stack.

1025
00:59:54,961 --> 00:59:58,039
Rym: Dude, at this point, I barely remember how WPA to actually work.

1026
00:59:58,280 --> 00:59:58,745
Rym: Right.

1027
00:59:58,806 --> 01:00:00,080
Scott: So, you know, it's not my fault.

1028
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:02,230
Scott: But I guess is that most people are we develop?

1029
01:00:02,270 --> 01:00:06,378
Scott: are we having a few people make technologies that are widely used without being looked at?

1030
01:00:06,721 --> 01:00:06,983
Rym: Yeah.

1031
01:00:07,164 --> 01:00:09,340
Scott: What are what things should I look at when I get home?

1032
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:09,861
Rym: Yeah.

1033
01:00:09,921 --> 01:00:10,163
Rym: Is it?

1034
01:00:10,203 --> 01:00:12,198
Rym: we're going to find some terrifying T.L.S.

1035
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:13,993
Rym: vulnerability like real soon.

1036
01:00:14,013 --> 01:00:14,719
Rym: that just ruins it.

1037
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:16,219
Scott: They've had a bunch of them and fixed them.

1038
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:16,884
Rym: Yeah, they have.

1039
01:00:17,648 --> 01:00:19,620
Rym: This one's hard to fix because it affects hardware.

1040
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:25,604
Rym: Yeah, I think that's the big the reason why people are so so many devices of companies that go out of business.

1041
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:30,819
Rym: That's why I think people are so afraid of the GMP problem, because GMP is super vulnerable to it.

1042
01:00:31,281 --> 01:00:43,800
Rym: And because GMP has the capability to be greatly enhanced by a hardware device, there are probably chips that hardware implement GMP with WPA to and that are now worthless.

1043
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:45,207
Scott: Worthless chips.

1044
01:00:45,328 --> 01:00:46,460
Rym: That is probably the problem.

1045
01:00:46,620 --> 01:00:48,919
Scott: I'll bet those chips should have made FPGAs, bro.

1046
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:50,136
Scott: Yeah, patch them.

1047
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:53,740
Rym: FPGAs generate a lot of heat and are slow and expensive, though.

1048
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:54,647
Scott: But you can patch them.

1049
01:00:54,889 --> 01:00:55,819
Rym: Yeah, you can patch them.

1050
01:00:56,560 --> 01:01:01,407
Rym: But that also means theoretically you can patch them, meaning a virus rewrites of what they're doing.

1051
01:01:01,428 --> 01:01:01,733
Rym: Yeah.

1052
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:02,621
Scott: Yeah.

1053
01:01:02,822 --> 01:01:03,023
Scott: Yeah.

1054
01:01:03,987 --> 01:01:06,560
Scott: You can patch it and then flip a little switch on them to lock.

1055
01:01:07,922 --> 01:01:08,323
Rym: Oh, my God.

1056
01:01:08,343 --> 01:01:19,680
Rym: I remember a story when I was a kid on this where there was a gas station in Michigan and they were ripping off their customers by charging them Superman style, Superman three, like extra cents per dollar.

1057
01:01:19,961 --> 01:01:22,920
Scott: I saw a YouTube video recently where somebody was at a gas station.

1058
01:01:23,202 --> 01:01:23,426
Rym: Oh, yeah.

1059
01:01:23,446 --> 01:01:24,319
Rym: They stopped pumping.

1060
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:25,980
Scott: They took they stopped pumping.

1061
01:01:26,181 --> 01:01:31,479
Scott: And usually when you stop pumping gas, you take the handle off and you put it back in the pump and then you look at the numbers.

1062
01:01:31,681 --> 01:01:31,901
Scott: Right.

1063
01:01:32,283 --> 01:01:37,965
Scott: What was happening was this gas was charging you about a penny per second, even if you weren't pumping.

1064
01:01:38,226 --> 01:01:44,800
Scott: So the time between when you took the handle off and put it in the car and took it out of the car and put it back on the pump, you were losing money.

1065
01:01:45,241 --> 01:01:48,380
Scott: And it was they were dizzy, stealing a few cents from every customer.

1066
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:51,740
Scott: And you would never notice, which is genius, but also evil.

1067
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:52,063
Rym: Yep.

1068
01:01:52,124 --> 01:01:53,440
Scott: So and worthy of jail.

1069
01:01:53,661 --> 01:01:58,122
Rym: The gas station, I remember because it made all the news when I was a kid, it went one step further.

1070
01:01:58,424 --> 01:02:02,641
Rym: There was a light switch that turned on a lamp in the gas station like it really worked.

1071
01:02:03,123 --> 01:02:11,243
Rym: But if that lamp was on, it also instructed some of the pumps to charge people extra money.

1072
01:02:12,327 --> 01:02:17,240
Rym: And they would turn it on much of the time, but they turn it off if an inspector was coming.

1073
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:20,600
Rym: They turn it off sometimes just to obscure the pattern.

1074
01:02:21,102 --> 01:02:25,639
Rym: And they made a lot of money off of that, apparently for a long time until some investigative reporter like figured it out.

1075
01:02:26,544 --> 01:02:27,740
Scott: Good job, investigative reporter.

1076
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:32,160
Rym: Yeah, I just still can't believe that this vulnerability was only discovered today.

1077
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:34,398
Rym: Well, released today, discovered a few months ago.

1078
