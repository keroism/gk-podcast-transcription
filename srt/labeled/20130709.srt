1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,489
Rym: It's Tuesday, July 9th, 2013.

2
00:00:11,489 --> 00:00:12,773
Scott: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,973 --> 00:00:13,475
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,595 --> 00:00:15,160
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight.

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:16,942
Rym: Hanabi.

6
00:00:17,663 --> 00:00:18,785
Rym: You gonna blow up.

7
00:00:21,169 --> 00:00:22,251
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:25,376 --> 00:00:28,864
Rym: This might be your last episode of GeekNights for a little while.

9
00:00:29,606 --> 00:00:30,309
Scott: Guaranteed.

10
00:00:30,389 --> 00:00:32,357
Scott: Probably won't hear from us until August.

11
00:00:32,436 --> 00:00:34,082
Scott: At least not in podcast form.

12
00:00:34,503 --> 00:00:37,550
Scott: Though, it is likely you will hear from us in other forms.

13
00:00:38,252 --> 00:00:41,961
Scott: Wait for the day.

14
00:00:41,981 --> 00:00:46,024
Rym: If you're looking for a bunch of GeekNights for the next few weeks, I'd recommend hitting the archive.

15
00:00:46,044 --> 00:00:48,235
Scott: You've got, I don't know, like fucking eight years worth.

16
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:49,100
Scott: Jesus Christ.

17
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,167
Rym: We've got so many episodes out.

18
00:00:52,247 --> 00:00:53,190
Rym: It's ridiculous.

19
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:54,053
Scott: All right.

20
00:00:54,414 --> 00:00:54,635
Rym: Yeah.

21
00:00:55,216 --> 00:00:57,306
Rym: So yeah, the night of con is this weekend.

22
00:00:57,487 --> 00:00:59,076
Scott: Why are you going to the meta moment so quickly?

23
00:00:59,177 --> 00:00:59,700
Scott: It's the opening.

24
00:01:00,161 --> 00:01:01,346
Rym: I'm preparing my final stuff.

25
00:01:01,366 --> 00:01:02,470
Rym: I'm printing out things.

26
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:07,289
Rym: I'm making DVDs of backup panels like we had last year in case anyone fails.

27
00:01:07,631 --> 00:01:09,037
Rym: There's DVD players in every room.

28
00:01:09,117 --> 00:01:16,424
Rym: There are at this library of videos of our old panels that we can just play if someone bails and we don't have a replacement.

29
00:01:16,445 --> 00:01:21,188
Scott: We're not going to use every mecha opener ever in chronological order up through the nineties.

30
00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:21,831
Rym: You want to bring it?

31
00:01:22,594 --> 00:01:22,956
Scott: You bring it.

32
00:01:23,077 --> 00:01:23,539
Rym: I don't have it.

33
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,261
Rym: I don't have it.

34
00:01:24,281 --> 00:01:24,622
Rym: Oh yeah.

35
00:01:24,682 --> 00:01:25,203
Rym: There we go.

36
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:32,765
Rym: So yeah, I would like on this Tuesday to review a game that Scott and I both played.

37
00:01:32,845 --> 00:01:40,013
Rym: So geek bite doesn't deserve a full show, but we bought 3ds and we actually played the adventure time game.

38
00:01:40,074 --> 00:01:42,503
Rym: Hey ice King, why did you steal our garbage?

39
00:01:42,764 --> 00:01:46,218
Scott: People told me, Hey, there's an adventure time game for 3ds.

40
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:48,106
Scott: And I was like, wait a minute.

41
00:01:48,126 --> 00:01:50,435
Scott: Those games usually just licensed shovelware.

42
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:51,921
Scott: And they said, no, no, no.

43
00:01:52,302 --> 00:01:55,611
Scott: This is actually like a Zelda two clone is good.

44
00:01:55,631 --> 00:01:57,656
Rym: It is a Zelda two clone.

45
00:01:58,238 --> 00:02:07,364
Rym: If you remove all the effort of Zelda two, and if you make it easier than Minish cap, it is basically non challenge.

46
00:02:07,424 --> 00:02:08,788
Scott: The game is garbage.

47
00:02:09,532 --> 00:02:11,318
Scott: Hey ice King, why'd you steal this game?

48
00:02:11,579 --> 00:02:14,370
Rym: I'm going to list in order the good things about this game.

49
00:02:14,751 --> 00:02:15,374
Rym: Good thing.

50
00:02:15,534 --> 00:02:17,503
Rym: Number one, the music is great.

51
00:02:17,764 --> 00:02:19,736
Scott: There's not a lot of it though, but what there is is great.

52
00:02:19,796 --> 00:02:21,704
Rym: The music that is in this game is great.

53
00:02:22,667 --> 00:02:23,229
Rym: Good thing.

54
00:02:23,289 --> 00:02:26,800
Rym: Number two, there is one joke that is hilarious.

55
00:02:27,061 --> 00:02:28,468
Rym: And I'm going to spoil it for you right now.

56
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:33,570
Rym: There's this point where the ice King gives the bud, uh, Finn and Jake, this really lame puzzle.

57
00:02:34,353 --> 00:02:37,123
Rym: And Jake's like, man, it's like, he's not even trying.

58
00:02:37,143 --> 00:02:43,086
Rym: And then fingers look sad and says, no, man, I think he's actually trying really hard all the time.

59
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,036
Rym: That is the funniest thing that happens in this game.

60
00:02:46,056 --> 00:02:53,109
Scott: Uh, I think that, you know, in the early part of the game, it's sort of jam packed with characters and stuff right up until about candy kingdom.

61
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:53,591
Scott: Yeah.

62
00:02:53,611 --> 00:02:56,886
Rym: And then in the game you get real Roger rabbit sparse, right?

63
00:02:56,967 --> 00:03:04,242
Scott: It's like suddenly though after you and each character pretty much says one thing and then you move on and there's no reason to like talk to them again ever.

64
00:03:04,262 --> 00:03:05,891
Scott: And they don't even do anything.

65
00:03:05,931 --> 00:03:09,751
Rym: like I met, you know, I found tree trunks and I was like, Oh, maybe I can get something.

66
00:03:09,771 --> 00:03:11,640
Rym: I get her to make the pie and I'm like, okay.

67
00:03:12,001 --> 00:03:13,248
Rym: And then I find that crystal Apple.

68
00:03:13,288 --> 00:03:15,017
Rym: I'm like, Oh man, I should take that to her.

69
00:03:15,037 --> 00:03:16,445
Rym: It doesn't fucking do anything.

70
00:03:16,586 --> 00:03:17,149
Scott: No, there's nothing.

71
00:03:17,351 --> 00:03:19,885
Rym: There's nothing like that juice goose wants all those wads of cash.

72
00:03:19,965 --> 00:03:20,367
Rym: I get him.

73
00:03:20,387 --> 00:03:24,848
Rym: He just gives me a useless bomb and then asks for more cash for another bomb.

74
00:03:25,411 --> 00:03:26,778
Scott: I don't even know why you need the bomb.

75
00:03:26,818 --> 00:03:27,441
Scott: What is it good for?

76
00:03:27,501 --> 00:03:27,782
Scott: Nothing.

77
00:03:27,803 --> 00:03:30,636
Rym: It just does a tiny amount of damage if you throw it at someone.

78
00:03:30,797 --> 00:03:31,138
Rym: Yeah.

79
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,871
Rym: And there's just all these things that don't do anything.

80
00:03:34,891 --> 00:03:38,343
Rym: And the game is so sparse that there's nothing to do.

81
00:03:38,404 --> 00:03:43,146
Rym: The puzzles are literally walk back to the beginning and then walk all the way back to where you are now.

82
00:03:43,226 --> 00:03:53,308
Scott: This is the one place it deviated from Zelda to Zelda to just like say Metroid, super Metroid or other Zelda games has a few items that are all really useful and essential.

83
00:03:53,448 --> 00:03:54,975
Scott: Every item is awesome in this game.

84
00:03:55,015 --> 00:03:58,972
Scott: It's like, here's a whole bunch of random, completely different healing items.

85
00:03:58,992 --> 00:04:03,892
Scott: You have to store in this inventory and I didn't even bother figuring out everything.

86
00:04:03,913 --> 00:04:04,977
Rym: You just ate it and whatever.

87
00:04:04,997 --> 00:04:06,041
Scott: Yeah, it's what you need.

88
00:04:06,061 --> 00:04:06,946
Scott: It doesn't fucking matter.

89
00:04:06,986 --> 00:04:07,730
Rym: I used an item.

90
00:04:07,911 --> 00:04:15,793
Rym: ever is when my thing was full and I'd use an item to get another item and it doesn't tell you a most of the items do and all the items that seem like they should do something really cool.

91
00:04:16,334 --> 00:04:17,500
Rym: Just give you a little buff.

92
00:04:17,521 --> 00:04:20,053
Rym: They don't like to actually turn you into a demon or anything.

93
00:04:20,115 --> 00:04:20,456
Rym: Cool.

94
00:04:20,697 --> 00:04:31,642
Rym: No, they, there were so many opportunities that were wasted, but what really bothers me is the lack of effort because there's one great bit in the beginning where you save hotdog princesses little dude.

95
00:04:31,984 --> 00:04:44,060
Rym: Pretty much this is the last point where the game is cool and she's like, Hey Jake, you know, one thing I've always wanted to do is have you stretch yourself out really long so I could just walk all over you and feel you like squishing under my feet.

96
00:04:44,521 --> 00:04:47,210
Rym: And Jake's like, that's really fucked up.

97
00:04:47,832 --> 00:04:51,787
Rym: That's really creepy, but now I can't stop imagining myself doing that.

98
00:04:52,229 --> 00:05:02,834
Rym: And then he gets the ability to turn into a bridge because he can't stop imagining that he's conceived of the idea of turning himself into a bridge and now you can go across all those bridges that you saw all over the place.

99
00:05:02,975 --> 00:05:03,156
Rym: Yep.

100
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:04,562
Rym: Later in the game.

101
00:05:04,582 --> 00:05:07,234
Rym: Uh, no, you just find open a chest.

102
00:05:07,294 --> 00:05:07,595
Rym: It's like.

103
00:05:07,615 --> 00:05:09,222
Rym: Jake now knows how to do the whatever.

104
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:09,865
Rym: It's like, really?

105
00:05:10,286 --> 00:05:15,026
Rym: You couldn't even put that token effort into keeping your funny theme through to the end.

106
00:05:15,287 --> 00:05:17,256
Scott: And the game is ridiculously short.

107
00:05:17,296 --> 00:05:22,664
Scott: It does that stupid thing a lot of games do where it's like, okay, let's extend the gameplay by adding a plus mode.

108
00:05:22,704 --> 00:05:23,286
Scott: And it's like, what?

109
00:05:23,648 --> 00:05:24,732
Scott: Why would I ever play?

110
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:27,683
Rym: Plus mode still has the tutorial at the beginning.

111
00:05:28,084 --> 00:05:28,565
Scott: Seriously.

112
00:05:28,806 --> 00:05:29,147
Scott: Yeah.

113
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:34,525
Rym: And the final end when you talk to the snow golem who I guess can talk now.

114
00:05:34,645 --> 00:05:34,986
Rym: Great.

115
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:44,665
Rym: Like just normally talk and you have to go collect all the clouds to make his cloud bride forcing you to backtrack all over the map instead of making a new area.

116
00:05:44,866 --> 00:05:46,130
Scott: Also super lazy.

117
00:05:46,151 --> 00:05:49,644
Rym: You don't backtrack to like four boss fights or four hard dungeons.

118
00:05:49,945 --> 00:05:57,031
Rym: You backed back to literally places where you jump up in a place where you cannot die and there are no consequences of failing.

119
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:02,795
Scott: There's no consequence of failing anywhere in this game and it's, it's, everything is completely linear.

120
00:06:03,016 --> 00:06:06,651
Rym: You do have to go back to a save point if you die, but there's a save point.

121
00:06:06,691 --> 00:06:09,845
Scott: Every two at least the same points have hot water nymphs.

122
00:06:09,886 --> 00:06:14,629
Rym: That's all I can say about it, but they never interact with you again, except when they're dancing up with party God.

123
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:25,275
Rym: Like they, there's all this pretense of flavor and pretense of the things you like about adventure time, but literally the game could be about any other property and you wouldn't even notice.

124
00:06:25,336 --> 00:06:29,199
Scott: If you're going to give me a game and say, look that we know this isn't the best game in the world, right?

125
00:06:29,239 --> 00:06:38,220
Scott: But we have inundated this game with this licensed property that we know you love and that is why you're going to enjoy this just for the licensed property and not for the game part.

126
00:06:38,702 --> 00:06:41,051
Scott: You better fucking drown me in fucking adventure time.

127
00:06:41,111 --> 00:06:45,227
Rym: And the game did for the first 20 minutes and then it just all stopped.

128
00:06:45,649 --> 00:06:45,870
Scott: Yep.

129
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:49,948
Rym: It's sort of like you can imagine the characters who talk to you halfway through the game.

130
00:06:49,968 --> 00:06:54,053
Scott: You can imagine people developing this game and it's like, you know, okay, they start working on it.

131
00:06:54,073 --> 00:06:54,999
Scott: Like they're working on level.

132
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:56,465
Scott: They're working on it in order.

133
00:06:56,626 --> 00:06:58,513
Rym: who framed Roger rabbit, right?

134
00:06:58,553 --> 00:07:06,257
Scott: It's like they're making level one and they're like, okay, we got to put adventure time stuff all over and they get to work it on level two at the candy and they're putting all sorts of stuff in there.

135
00:07:06,277 --> 00:07:08,627
Scott: and then it's like, oh, we got to get this thing out.

136
00:07:09,008 --> 00:07:10,494
Scott: Hurry up and get those last levels out.

137
00:07:10,574 --> 00:07:11,819
Scott: Shit.

138
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:17,983
Rym: I would guess that 80 plus percent of the areas and things in this game do nothing and are not interactive.

139
00:07:18,345 --> 00:07:22,602
Scott: All you do is walk, hit, boring, same old enemies that can't really hurt you.

140
00:07:22,622 --> 00:07:27,605
Rym: I never leveled up hearts until I couldn't level up anything else because I never got damaged.

141
00:07:27,946 --> 00:07:29,713
Rym: Then the enemies one.

142
00:07:30,115 --> 00:07:34,328
Rym: in a game this short, you're going to pull a palette swap on me, right?

143
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:38,881
Scott: And it's a, it's, it's a DS game and a 3ds game, but you know what?

144
00:07:39,223 --> 00:07:43,520
Scott: Both of those systems have tons and tons of storage on those little cartridges.

145
00:07:43,721 --> 00:07:51,570
Rym: You can fill it up with shit and the enemies while there's a bunch of them with really good animation, basically killing them all the same.

146
00:07:51,631 --> 00:07:54,880
Rym: There is literally nothing to combat.

147
00:07:55,121 --> 00:07:56,888
Rym: Hit the button, hit it again.

148
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,073
Rym: Oh, look at ability.

149
00:07:58,133 --> 00:08:00,061
Rym: It'll be immediately useful right here.

150
00:08:00,121 --> 00:08:03,898
Scott: And probably never again, I guess it's a game a kindergartener could play.

151
00:08:03,938 --> 00:08:08,922
Scott: If that, you know, as a target audience of young kids with DS is want to play adventure time, but here's the thing.

152
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:10,809
Scott: I was their age playing Zelda two.

153
00:08:10,929 --> 00:08:14,764
Rym: So when I was a young kid, Zelda two was my jam.

154
00:08:14,805 --> 00:08:19,728
Rym: If you give me this, when I was at the age when Zelda two came out, I would have thought it was garbage.

155
00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:20,472
Scott: Exactly.

156
00:08:20,493 --> 00:08:21,378
Rym: I still think it's garbage.

157
00:08:21,398 --> 00:08:24,189
Scott: I would have thought it was for like nursery school kids who couldn't even talk.

158
00:08:24,731 --> 00:08:30,934
Scott: So at least one positive about the game, I guess, is that its price reflects its quality.

159
00:08:31,014 --> 00:08:34,047
Scott: It is cheaper than other games, though not cheap enough.

160
00:08:34,168 --> 00:08:36,097
Scott: I'm going to sell my copy to get some money's back.

161
00:08:36,119 --> 00:08:39,652
Rym: This game is worth maybe a dollar or two as an iPhone game.

162
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:40,556
Scott: Yeah, something like that.

163
00:08:40,736 --> 00:08:43,951
Rym: So shame on anyone who recommended we play this game.

164
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:44,876
Rym: This game is bullish.

165
00:08:44,896 --> 00:08:46,643
Scott: They're coming out with another one.

166
00:08:46,744 --> 00:08:48,069
Scott: I'm not going to even bother.

167
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,357
Rym: Nope, because it was neat.

168
00:08:50,377 --> 00:08:54,273
Rym: There was one or two good jokes and they're all in the beginning and then there's nothing else.

169
00:08:55,037 --> 00:09:00,462
Rym: I guess it was kind of funny that Lumpy Space Princess tries to literally kill everyone in the world at the end.

170
00:09:01,003 --> 00:09:05,336
Rym: But that side scroller shooter at the end was awful.

171
00:09:05,356 --> 00:09:08,445
Scott: Yes, the next one is called Adventure Time.

172
00:09:08,565 --> 00:09:10,691
Scott: Explore the Dungeon Because I Don't Know 3DS.

173
00:09:10,711 --> 00:09:16,107
Scott: It could be like a dungeon crawly.

174
00:09:16,167 --> 00:09:18,073
Rym: I learned my lesson my whole life.

175
00:09:18,233 --> 00:09:21,926
Rym: I have said licensed property games are shit and I will never play them.

176
00:09:22,267 --> 00:09:24,195
Rym: You assholes tricked us into playing this game.

177
00:09:24,215 --> 00:09:25,400
Rym: I was right.

178
00:09:25,882 --> 00:09:26,727
Rym: I shouldn't have played it.

179
00:09:26,907 --> 00:09:30,244
Scott: But this explore the dungeon because I don't know isn't just going to be a portable game.

180
00:09:30,284 --> 00:09:35,405
Scott: It's getting on PS three, three sixty three DS at Wii U. So maybe it is.

181
00:09:35,425 --> 00:09:39,420
Scott: and play solo or grab your friends for four player co-op multiplayer.

182
00:09:39,881 --> 00:09:43,192
Scott: I am voiceovers from original TV cast.

183
00:09:43,312 --> 00:09:45,560
Rym: Is it developed and published by the same people?

184
00:09:46,121 --> 00:09:50,821
Rym: I don't know, because if it's made by the people who made this game, I have zero faith in it.

185
00:09:51,063 --> 00:09:55,383
Scott: It says all new story and adventure from serious creator Penn Ward and developer way forward.

186
00:09:55,564 --> 00:10:00,685
Scott: So is the developer of the old one way forward and then conquer a massive hundred floor dungeon.

187
00:10:00,705 --> 00:10:02,771
Scott: So it could be a road you like.

188
00:10:03,614 --> 00:10:05,780
Rym: Yeah, not trusting it, not playing it.

189
00:10:06,001 --> 00:10:08,645
Scott: Yeah, just saying this game was awful.

190
00:10:11,229 --> 00:10:21,609
Scott: So in my news today, maybe a day where something happens that I never thought would happen, but wanted to happen.

191
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:22,993
Rym: Oh, the return of five.

192
00:10:26,941 --> 00:10:29,109
Rym: You know, I've been worried about this day.

193
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:38,997
Scott: I'm so because for those of you who are unawares, Civ had some good parts, but some bad parts, mostly the multiplayer.

194
00:10:39,017 --> 00:10:49,435
Rym: We got to go all the way back because when Civ one and Civ two came out, that was an era where you would either put the save file on a disk or something and share it with someone.

195
00:10:49,937 --> 00:10:53,452
Rym: Or you just played single player and you had infinite time and didn't care.

196
00:10:53,532 --> 00:10:54,155
Rym: That was great.

197
00:10:54,377 --> 00:11:00,685
Rym: I think I might have spent more hours on Civ two than any other game ever, including the decade plus of Counter-Strike I've been playing.

198
00:11:00,705 --> 00:11:04,160
Scott: Civ three was pretty good, but mostly neglected by people.

199
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,051
Scott: Civ four was the one that really caught on hardcore.

200
00:11:07,553 --> 00:11:22,483
Rym: It's easy to forget that Civ four was super fun, but we didn't really play it for serious or multiplayer until a bunch of expansions came out because they made the game as crunchy and beautiful and horrifying as Civ two.

201
00:11:23,285 --> 00:11:28,904
Scott: So Civ five came and streamlined a lot of stuff in an eclipse Euro game sort of fashion, right?

202
00:11:29,185 --> 00:11:30,149
Rym: Good and bad.

203
00:11:30,169 --> 00:11:33,882
Rym: On one hand, it made combat really clever and advanced warzy.

204
00:11:34,423 --> 00:11:42,012
Rym: On the other hand, turned into a board game and I found myself always playing to win and never playing to do my bullshit like I used to do in Civ four.

205
00:11:42,273 --> 00:11:42,494
Scott: Yep.

206
00:11:43,056 --> 00:11:47,114
Scott: So Civ five had problems with the multiplayer, which we've discussed in this podcast.

207
00:11:47,194 --> 00:11:53,100
Scott: Mostly it wasn't turn based and there would be a lot of completely arbitrary shit and there was play by mail.

208
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:53,542
Scott: that didn't.

209
00:11:53,562 --> 00:11:56,740
Scott: I don't think it was played by mail and multiplayer's didn't work at all.

210
00:11:56,941 --> 00:12:00,151
Rym: And single player was actually really simplistic and not that fun.

211
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:00,532
Scott: Yes.

212
00:12:00,572 --> 00:12:04,306
Scott: So Civ five today has released an expansion.

213
00:12:05,009 --> 00:12:08,644
Scott: It's not their first expansion, but it is a new expansion called brave new world.

214
00:12:09,126 --> 00:12:13,060
Scott: And they call it, let's see, ahem, the combination of the game's evolution.

215
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,680
Scott: since it's 2010 releases games, three years old, at least it's getting an expansion now.

216
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,544
Scott: So don't look for Civ six anytime soon.

217
00:12:20,687 --> 00:12:24,817
Scott: This supposedly fixes the multiplayer.

218
00:12:25,218 --> 00:12:26,944
Scott: They recognize the problem.

219
00:12:27,265 --> 00:12:31,982
Scott: How often is it that we point out a problem and someone does what we say they should do?

220
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:33,225
Scott: Holy shit.

221
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,873
Scott: This supposedly on paper fixes.

222
00:12:36,133 --> 00:12:46,311
Rym: Well, I remember when we were talking about Civ five originally, we kind of expected because Civ four was not actually that great until they added all the expansions to it later.

223
00:12:46,592 --> 00:12:49,082
Rym: It's almost like Civ has version one.

224
00:12:49,142 --> 00:12:51,009
Rym: It's like the beta and then the real version.

225
00:12:52,213 --> 00:13:02,024
Scott: So yeah, uh, hopefully this is on the steam sale because when I get back from Australia in August, I guess everyone will be way better at this game than me because I guess they also have been playing it since 2010

226
00:13:02,024 --> 00:13:04,134
Rym: and played on my laptop on the way to and from Australia.

227
00:13:04,475 --> 00:13:04,897
Scott: Who knows?

228
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:05,520
Scott: Who knows?

229
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,584
Scott: That's 20.

230
00:13:06,584 --> 00:13:10,542
Rym: that's 50 hours I can spend playing this game minus takeoff and landing twice each way.

231
00:13:10,843 --> 00:13:14,639
Scott: Uh, I think I'll be doing a variety of things with my hours and not just one thing.

232
00:13:15,121 --> 00:13:16,691
Rym: Well, like what, what are you going to do on the plane?

233
00:13:17,094 --> 00:13:17,839
Scott: I can do lots of stuff.

234
00:13:17,859 --> 00:13:18,983
Scott: I got to read some books.

235
00:13:19,404 --> 00:13:21,973
Scott: Nah, Civ five could play some 3ds games.

236
00:13:22,013 --> 00:13:38,831
Rym: I have a stack of my, what I think what I'll find interesting though is that if we start playing multiplayer, if I recall my experiences with Civ five before the expansion, because the combat is basically advanced wars, I never really lost battles.

237
00:13:40,034 --> 00:13:41,779
Scott: So I wonder if that will remain true.

238
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:50,093
Scott: My main problem with Civ five is that there's just, even though it is simplified from say Civ four, uh, there's still just way too much stuff.

239
00:13:50,154 --> 00:13:54,068
Scott: It's just like you open up a city and it's like, yeah, check out all this shit.

240
00:13:54,108 --> 00:13:57,920
Rym: You got to look at Civ five before the expansion.

241
00:13:58,101 --> 00:14:00,494
Rym: I'd open up a city and be like, so where's all my bullshit.

242
00:14:00,514 --> 00:14:01,500
Rym: There's like nothing here.

243
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,122
Rym: Click, click, click.

244
00:14:02,162 --> 00:14:02,845
Rym: My city is perfect.

245
00:14:02,866 --> 00:14:04,372
Rym: There's nothing I can do.

246
00:14:04,553 --> 00:14:07,625
Scott: Just managing one city is an entire game in and of itself.

247
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:13,368
Rym: Partly because unlike Civ four, the game really didn't encourage you to build just one of everything.

248
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:19,092
Rym: So you had to be a little more choosy and there's not as many decisions to make in the pre expansions of five.

249
00:14:20,336 --> 00:14:24,009
Scott: But anyway, there's just in Civ, there is a lot of stuff going on everywhere.

250
00:14:24,552 --> 00:14:27,662
Scott: So I like to play it to, you know, turn based asynchronously.

251
00:14:27,682 --> 00:14:30,457
Scott: So every single turn I can check every single thing.

252
00:14:30,497 --> 00:14:36,143
Scott: If you play real time, my ideal way to play real time, then what happens is people like, Hey, hurry it up asshole.

253
00:14:36,204 --> 00:14:37,631
Scott: And I'm like, Hey, I'm checking my city.

254
00:14:37,832 --> 00:14:46,810
Rym: I think the ideal way is I've always said to play a multiplayer game of Civ five is to play the first, you know, X hundred turns live voice chat.

255
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:55,677
Rym: Those don't have a lot of as many, uh, you know, hard decisions to a sort of a plateau point and then go play by email asynchronous.

256
00:14:55,918 --> 00:15:00,895
Rym: And then occasionally like once a month or so schedule a let's play with voice chat for a while.

257
00:15:01,297 --> 00:15:05,456
Scott: Hopefully the multiplayer in this new version will allow that sort of arrangement.

258
00:15:05,557 --> 00:15:05,738
Rym: Yeah.

259
00:15:05,758 --> 00:15:09,914
Rym: We will give it at the full and brutal review once we start playing it.

260
00:15:09,994 --> 00:15:11,600
Rym: But PAX Australia takes precedence.

261
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:18,010
Scott: Yeah.

262
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:20,094
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

263
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,638
Rym: So there's a comedian, uh, Simon Amstel.

264
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:27,280
Rym: Uh, I've seen a couple of his bits just cause a lot of it's on YouTube, but there's a video here.

265
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,143
Rym: That's actually pretty great.

266
00:15:28,163 --> 00:15:37,873
Rym: They take one of his short stand up routines, cut out all the laughter and replace it with kind of sad piano music.

267
00:15:38,775 --> 00:15:48,297
Rym: And it really coupled with, you know, when a comedian tells a joke, like you don't pay attention to what they're doing when they're waiting for the laughter to die down before they start talking again.

268
00:15:48,317 --> 00:15:52,593
Rym: But just the way his delivery is, it almost looks like he's about to cry.

269
00:15:52,613 --> 00:15:59,560
Rym: And the words he's saying are actually really sad and pathetic if not in the context of stand up comedy.

270
00:16:00,261 --> 00:16:04,375
Rym: So it's actually kind of sad and poignant to watch.

271
00:16:04,415 --> 00:16:08,910
Scott: Basically it's like when they took the shining and made it into a different movie.

272
00:16:08,991 --> 00:16:13,106
Scott: This guy took his own comedy routine and turned it into a different thing.

273
00:16:13,126 --> 00:16:16,460
Scott: It's pretty great editing shows pretty great power of editing.

274
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,143
Scott: We all know.

275
00:16:17,224 --> 00:16:17,465
Scott: Yes.

276
00:16:17,907 --> 00:16:20,258
Scott: I hope you know, if you don't know, you're in trouble.

277
00:16:20,378 --> 00:16:25,263
Rym: If you're an audio guy, you can tell kind of how they cut the laughter out and you can hear some artifacts from that in there.

278
00:16:25,765 --> 00:16:26,648
Scott: Mm hmm.

279
00:16:27,511 --> 00:16:29,036
Scott: Oh, do you want to hear a thing of the day?

280
00:16:29,057 --> 00:16:29,920
Rym: I perhaps do.

281
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:33,887
Scott: How about a newsreel uploaded to YouTube?

282
00:16:33,907 --> 00:16:43,790
Scott: That's like 10 minutes long of the 1933 Stanley Cup final Rangers at Leafs in Toronto.

283
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:46,258
Scott: The Rangers won by the way.

284
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:47,040
Scott: They didn't win again.

285
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:52,000
Scott: I think they won a few other times, but then they had like a 54 year gap of not winning.

286
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,368
Scott: But yeah, this is pretty amazing.

287
00:16:55,489 --> 00:16:59,285
Scott: You can see that a 54 year gap means they're watching this old time hockey.

288
00:16:59,505 --> 00:17:08,482
Scott: And even though like, you know, there's no lines on the ice really, except for the blue lines and no one's wearing a helmet, not even the goalie, not even a face mask.

289
00:17:09,064 --> 00:17:11,814
Scott: It looks a lot like the hockey that's played today.

290
00:17:11,834 --> 00:17:16,050
Rym: A lot of the basics of hockey have not changed that much over the years.

291
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:16,632
Scott: Yeah.

292
00:17:17,295 --> 00:17:22,902
Scott: And they go in and they interview both teams and all the coaches and it's like, Whoa, this is, you know, it's pretty incredible right here.

293
00:17:23,464 --> 00:17:29,530
Scott: And then it's at the end when they show the picture of the, the 1933 Stanley Cup, it's like, Oh man, look at that Stanley.

294
00:17:29,811 --> 00:17:30,233
Rym: Oh my God.

295
00:17:30,253 --> 00:17:36,396
Rym: The Stanley Cup to this day, to me is pretty much the most prestigious sport thing you can get.

296
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:39,207
Rym: I put it higher than a gold medal in the Olympics.

297
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:41,677
Scott: How many Olympic gold medals there are a ton, right?

298
00:17:41,938 --> 00:17:46,194
Scott: How many, you know, you win a baseball world series, they make a new trophy for you.

299
00:17:46,234 --> 00:17:51,734
Scott: You win NFL soccer world cup, but hockey, they make new world cups.

300
00:17:51,854 --> 00:17:53,099
Scott: Every world cup in hockey.

301
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,088
Scott: There is the Stanley Cup.

302
00:17:55,148 --> 00:17:57,116
Rym: It's not Stanley's cup, right?

303
00:17:57,136 --> 00:18:00,572
Scott: You don't, it's not like they make a new Stanley cup for everyone who wins every time.

304
00:18:00,632 --> 00:18:01,376
Scott: It's like, no, no, no.

305
00:18:01,396 --> 00:18:03,064
Scott: There is one and that's it.

306
00:18:03,145 --> 00:18:05,958
Scott: And that's why I think other sports really made a big mistake.

307
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:07,184
Scott: Not doing the same thing.

308
00:18:07,224 --> 00:18:10,920
Rym: There's a special particular kind of excitement you only get with hockey.

309
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,505
Rym: And that is the excitement of.

310
00:18:13,307 --> 00:18:15,815
Rym: this is a game where the cup could appear.

311
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:21,011
Rym: It is on the premises because if one of these two teams wins cup is on the premises.

312
00:18:21,051 --> 00:18:30,666
Rym: Well, there are multiples of the cops because certain, uh, pretty sure there's three certain unnamed people have dropped it on the ice.

313
00:18:30,726 --> 00:18:34,018
Scott: I'm pretty sure there's three, but there's effectively one.

314
00:18:34,038 --> 00:18:34,118
Scott: Yeah.

315
00:18:34,821 --> 00:18:38,134
Rym: There is one idea of the Stanley cup that gets passed.

316
00:18:38,355 --> 00:18:40,503
Rym: Remember it was originally a challenge cup.

317
00:18:40,885 --> 00:18:41,106
Scott: Yep.

318
00:18:41,507 --> 00:18:43,434
Rym: I would almost want to bring that back someday.

319
00:18:43,876 --> 00:18:47,097
Scott: I also agree, but yeah, imagine it, you know, football could have done the same thing.

320
00:18:47,117 --> 00:18:49,591
Scott: They, you know, it's a new relative football's relatively new.

321
00:18:49,993 --> 00:18:53,329
Scott: When they started football, they could have been like, yeah, only one trophy.

322
00:18:53,369 --> 00:18:53,951
Scott: This is it.

323
00:18:54,252 --> 00:18:55,417
Scott: You know, hockey's older.

324
00:18:55,879 --> 00:18:58,632
Scott: They could have just be like, hockey's already been doing it right.

325
00:18:58,672 --> 00:18:59,597
Scott: It wasn't a new idea.

326
00:18:59,617 --> 00:19:03,293
Rym: Do you know what the oldest hockey franchise is in the United States?

327
00:19:03,313 --> 00:19:05,663
Scott: Oh, in the United States is the red wings, isn't it?

328
00:19:05,723 --> 00:19:05,944
Scott: Yeah.

329
00:19:06,144 --> 00:19:06,525
Scott: Okay.

330
00:19:06,586 --> 00:19:11,542
Scott: Uh, all these teams are crazy old, the original six teams, whatever.

331
00:19:11,562 --> 00:19:11,623
Scott: Yup.

332
00:19:11,763 --> 00:19:21,000
Scott: Um, I mean, in this video they're talking about how the Rangers are like, Oh man, it was real hard and we had to play the Maroons, the Montreal Maroons.

333
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:22,943
Scott: All right.

334
00:19:23,003 --> 00:19:25,030
Scott: So yeah, so pretty awesome.

335
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:28,842
Rym: The meta moment, Connecticut this weekend, Hartford, Connecticut.

336
00:19:28,902 --> 00:19:29,725
Scott: Holy shit.

337
00:19:29,866 --> 00:19:33,016
Scott: This is going to be off the hook, right?

338
00:19:33,036 --> 00:19:35,988
Scott: So, you know, we run panels and workshops at Connecticut.

339
00:19:36,048 --> 00:19:36,249
Scott: Yes.

340
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:36,812
Rym: Me, Scott.

341
00:19:36,852 --> 00:19:40,747
Rym: And we added a third person, Kristen, thus forming the triumvirate, right?

342
00:19:41,048 --> 00:19:41,791
Scott: Triad over it.

343
00:19:42,413 --> 00:19:47,631
Scott: Uh, the thing with Connecticut is that it's an everything geek con, which is awesome, right?

344
00:19:47,912 --> 00:19:53,311
Scott: To begin with is that we have done such a good job with these panels, right?

345
00:19:53,472 --> 00:19:57,811
Scott: That I actually want to go to Connecticut con and not work at Connecticut con is a prize.

346
00:19:57,831 --> 00:20:08,997
Scott: I didn't, I didn't foresee this for some reason that if I worked at a convention that our influence would improve the convention to such a degree that I would no longer want to work and would want to attend it.

347
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:17,573
Rym: Connecticut is a con that if I suddenly was not staff and was not presenting anymore and had to pay for a badge with money, I'd probably keep going.

348
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:18,316
Scott: I would keep going.

349
00:20:18,697 --> 00:20:19,279
Scott: Absolutely.

350
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:27,191
Scott: So not only are there tons of amazing panels and workshops, Japanese handcraft, small press publishing beyond Dungeons and Dragons.

351
00:20:27,272 --> 00:20:28,176
Scott: I wonder who's doing that one.

352
00:20:28,437 --> 00:20:36,509
Scott: Rock climbing, analyzing animation, atomic Robo Q and a, yeah, we don't need to read the whole thing, but yeah, Adam war rock concerts.

353
00:20:36,529 --> 00:20:38,836
Scott: Oc remix doing three panels.

354
00:20:38,856 --> 00:20:39,177
Rym: Oh my God.

355
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,225
Rym: Oc remix is going to be there, right?

356
00:20:41,245 --> 00:20:43,553
Scott: Super art fight is going to be there.

357
00:20:43,573 --> 00:20:45,099
Rym: Super art file.

358
00:20:45,139 --> 00:20:48,051
Scott: So it's a voice actors and guys with the glasses.

359
00:20:48,091 --> 00:20:50,280
Scott: I know you people like you can team four stars.

360
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,326
Scott: I know you people like, and even though I don't really care about those, Jim Cummings, uncle, yo, all these people are there.

361
00:20:55,648 --> 00:20:56,430
Scott: Everybody's there.

362
00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:00,468
Scott: Uh, also it was gonna be a net runner tournament, but you know what?

363
00:21:00,508 --> 00:21:03,383
Scott: This net runner tournament, I didn't find out about it till just recently.

364
00:21:03,443 --> 00:21:11,512
Scott: The official Connecticut net runner tournament has a, this is not a joke or an exaggeration, a $1,000 prize payout.

365
00:21:11,893 --> 00:21:14,983
Scott: If you win the Connecticut net runner tournament, you get $500.

366
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:17,933
Scott: That's insane.

367
00:21:17,953 --> 00:21:20,100
Scott: I didn't even, where the fuck does this money come from?

368
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:26,350
Scott: I mean, you win a tournament and like the strat and it's like, here you go, have a play mat and a, and a token of appreciation.

369
00:21:26,391 --> 00:21:26,792
Scott: You won.

370
00:21:26,853 --> 00:21:27,857
Scott: Congratulations here.

371
00:21:28,058 --> 00:21:37,588
Scott: You get the next data pack for free, 15 bucks, $500 in second place, $300 third and fourth place, a hundred dollars each net runner tournament.

372
00:21:38,251 --> 00:21:44,722
Scott: Oh, and there's also all these other tournaments where that payout also like magic tournaments and a star Wars, LCG tournament and all sorts of craziness.

373
00:21:44,782 --> 00:21:50,242
Rym: Also, Connecticut has better tabletop gaming than most gaming cons we ever attend.

374
00:21:50,402 --> 00:21:50,784
Scott: Yup.

375
00:21:50,824 --> 00:21:55,240
Scott: They have tons of tables for role-playing and or tabletop board war gaming.

376
00:21:55,561 --> 00:21:59,598
Scott: And the library of board games is the greatest that I have personally seen.

377
00:21:59,638 --> 00:22:06,586
Scott: It may not be the greatest at any con is the greatest I have been to even better, dare I say than the packs board game library.

378
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:10,941
Rym: So one complaint we do get every year is that we don't do enough panels.

379
00:22:11,202 --> 00:22:15,757
Rym: So we are only doing six this year because we have duties.

380
00:22:15,797 --> 00:22:17,303
Scott: put ourselves on the schedule there.

381
00:22:17,644 --> 00:22:19,431
Rym: So we're doing, and y'all linked to it.

382
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:24,850
Rym: Android net runner beyond dungeons and dragons and may openers from around the world.

383
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:34,759
Rym: The panel auditions for kinetic con 2014. a decade of running panels, some non 18 plus opposite the 18 plus content.

384
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:44,247
Rym: where I got some horror stories about running panels like a decade ago at like Ohio con and how to recommend anime.

385
00:22:44,428 --> 00:22:45,251
Scott: Oh, he did that one already.

386
00:22:45,272 --> 00:22:45,653
Scott: That was good.

387
00:22:45,854 --> 00:22:46,055
Rym: Yeah.

388
00:22:46,256 --> 00:22:47,661
Rym: And beyond dungeons and dragons.

389
00:22:47,882 --> 00:22:55,488
Rym: For those of you not going to PAX Australia, we're doing the dry practice run of the new version of the panel at kinetic con.

390
00:22:56,191 --> 00:23:13,966
Rym: And then the next week on Friday, we're doing it at PAX Australia, uh, at 1 PM in the Wombat theater, Wombat theater, and then at PAX Prime on Monday because PAX Prime is now four days long and PAX Prime is merely like a month after packs.

391
00:23:14,307 --> 00:23:17,758
Rym: We are at 1 30 PM in the Wolfman theater.

392
00:23:17,918 --> 00:23:21,675
Rym: I think we've been scheduled in that theater more times than any other theater.

393
00:23:21,695 --> 00:23:23,342
Rym: I think Iraq knit is number two for us.

394
00:23:23,764 --> 00:23:24,928
Rym: Naga might be number three.

395
00:23:25,469 --> 00:23:27,035
Rym: We've done a lot of goddamn packs panels.

396
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:32,495
Rym: So yeah, we are doing a new panel brand new called bad game.

397
00:23:32,515 --> 00:23:34,363
Scott: You should put that panel together in August.

398
00:23:34,604 --> 00:23:35,890
Rym: I've been working on it actually.

399
00:23:36,151 --> 00:23:37,818
Rym: I got this whole bit about Yahtzee.

400
00:23:37,898 --> 00:23:40,066
Rym: is Yahtzee a good game or a bad game.

401
00:23:40,347 --> 00:23:45,103
Rym: And the answer depends on how smart you are, but not in the way you'd expect.

402
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:45,967
Scott: Okay.

403
00:23:45,987 --> 00:23:49,662
Scott: So speaking of all this con traveling offers, what's the book club book room.

404
00:23:49,722 --> 00:24:00,000
Rym: The book club book is a book called Stasi land, nonfiction narratives about what it's, what it was actually like for real people to live under the Stasi in East Germany.

405
00:24:00,201 --> 00:24:00,483
Scott: All right.

406
00:24:00,805 --> 00:24:01,529
Rym: It's actually pretty good.

407
00:24:01,549 --> 00:24:02,073
Rym: I've been reading it.

408
00:24:02,234 --> 00:24:12,407
Scott: So yeah, speaking of packs awesome kinetic con this weekend, then we're flying to packs us, then we're doing packs us and then we're going to be in Melbourne for the rest of July, which means you won't see GeekNights until August.

409
00:24:12,427 --> 00:24:14,718
Scott: So what will you do to alleviate your board?

410
00:24:14,758 --> 00:24:18,720
Scott: And besides listen to crappy old GeekNights episodes, I don't even know why you listen to this episode.

411
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:30,723
Scott: What you should do is you should follow us and all the other internet places, me, Rym and GeekNights accounts on, you know, flicker, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, et cetera, et cetera, Google plus.

412
00:24:31,626 --> 00:24:34,535
Scott: And we will be posting things from down under.

413
00:24:35,197 --> 00:24:37,865
Scott: all our pictures might get flipped over upside down.

414
00:24:37,885 --> 00:24:41,857
Rym: No one, no one's ever made that joke.

415
00:24:42,198 --> 00:24:43,482
Scott: No one has until just now.

416
00:24:43,502 --> 00:24:54,823
Rym: In fact, I recall in the forum for PAX Australia and on the Reddit, there was a rule that was basically if you make the joke, fix that for you and flip a picture upside down, we will kill you.

417
00:24:54,843 --> 00:25:01,719
Scott: Uh, but yeah, you should follow all those things.

418
00:25:01,939 --> 00:25:04,931
Rym: Especially because we might die of poison while we're there.

419
00:25:04,951 --> 00:25:08,303
Rym: That's also very possibly starvation and dehydration.

420
00:25:08,323 --> 00:25:11,030
Scott: This could be the last GeekNights ever.

421
00:25:11,612 --> 00:25:13,356
Scott: Oh, it's possible ominous.

422
00:25:13,376 --> 00:25:22,888
Rym: So if you are at pegs Australia or if you happen to be a GeekNights listener who lives in or about Melbourne, uh, let us know.

423
00:25:23,069 --> 00:25:27,122
Rym: We are kind of going out there without our usual entourage.

424
00:25:27,403 --> 00:25:28,305
Scott: Yeah.

425
00:25:29,187 --> 00:25:32,215
Rym: No bodyguards, no friends, no family.

426
00:25:32,335 --> 00:25:33,277
Rym: It's just us.

427
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:38,072
Rym: So if you want to hang out with us or kidnap us or whatever, it's probably your best chance.

428
00:25:40,298 --> 00:25:41,222
Scott: Okay, let's move on.

429
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:48,213
Rym: So you might recall that, uh, we in numerous lectures, in fact, uh, I'll link to one of them from a PAX East, which wasn't that long ago.

430
00:25:48,856 --> 00:25:51,444
Rym: We talk about how games like shadows over Camelot suck ass.

431
00:25:51,725 --> 00:25:57,864
Scott: Oh, most specifically pandemic and to some extent the Battlestar galactic game.

432
00:25:57,905 --> 00:25:58,086
Scott: Yup.

433
00:25:58,186 --> 00:26:05,804
Rym: Though that game, it's a little bit, it's a little bit better than the other ones, but that game, especially with the expansion at least has more of a mafia feel to it.

434
00:26:05,845 --> 00:26:06,447
Rym: But I digress.

435
00:26:06,729 --> 00:26:08,035
Rym: We say that these games are crap.

436
00:26:08,075 --> 00:26:11,249
Rym: And Scott, what is our primary reason for hating on these games?

437
00:26:11,329 --> 00:26:16,828
Scott: Well, the communication rules specifically and shadows over Camelot are vague and bullshit.

438
00:26:17,189 --> 00:26:22,522
Rym: Well, I feel pretty good about playing cards in that area.

439
00:26:22,602 --> 00:26:26,493
Rym: I feel about three goods, three, three times.

440
00:26:26,533 --> 00:26:26,814
Rym: Good.

441
00:26:26,834 --> 00:26:27,937
Scott: Let me go to the refrigerator.

442
00:26:29,301 --> 00:26:30,446
Scott: How many people want water?

443
00:26:30,586 --> 00:26:33,800
Scott: One, two, three, four, four people want water, but not Rym.

444
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,124
Scott: Rym doesn't want water.

445
00:26:35,185 --> 00:26:38,638
Scott: Everybody Rym did not ask for water from the fridge.

446
00:26:38,698 --> 00:26:38,939
Rym: Yeah.

447
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:39,682
Rym: Fuck those games.

448
00:26:40,384 --> 00:26:43,234
Rym: We have talked at length about why these are bad mechanics.

449
00:26:43,575 --> 00:26:47,753
Rym: This is why bridge has such complicated meta signaling rules.

450
00:26:48,075 --> 00:26:50,585
Rym: This is why you're not allowed to fucking talk to your partner in Euchre.

451
00:26:50,826 --> 00:26:51,046
Scott: Yup.

452
00:26:51,588 --> 00:27:00,666
Scott: So, uh, what happened is we looked at this field to see our nominees and I saw a bunch of games on there and one of them was called Hannah B and I was like, Oh, I never heard of that.

453
00:27:01,428 --> 00:27:06,407
Scott: So then I'm in light fricking complete strategist, you know, for net runner or something.

454
00:27:06,729 --> 00:27:17,653
Scott: And I see on the, you know, every game store has that shelf towards the front that has the tiny games in a box about the same size box as say, um, what's the game with chicken with the red chips?

455
00:27:18,816 --> 00:27:19,398
Scott: Oh, no thanks.

456
00:27:19,458 --> 00:27:19,940
Scott: No thanks.

457
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,727
Scott: And the same size box is no thanks.

458
00:27:21,787 --> 00:27:24,658
Scott: I see Hannah B and I'm like, Oh, isn't that?

459
00:27:24,698 --> 00:27:25,984
Scott: this field is your nominee.

460
00:27:26,104 --> 00:27:29,076
Scott: How is it in this tiny as box for such a little bit of money?

461
00:27:29,097 --> 00:27:32,189
Scott: I will buy this on Amazon cause the strat is overpriced.

462
00:27:32,811 --> 00:27:34,016
Scott: So I bought it on Amazon.

463
00:27:34,076 --> 00:27:34,719
Rym: Oh, spoilers.

464
00:27:34,739 --> 00:27:35,804
Rym: It later did win.

465
00:27:35,824 --> 00:27:36,567
Rym: this field is y'all.

466
00:27:36,628 --> 00:27:36,808
Scott: Yeah.

467
00:27:36,849 --> 00:27:41,226
Scott: Like fucking two days ago in one, this field this yard, but I bought it and played it before it won.

468
00:27:42,089 --> 00:27:45,842
Scott: Uh, and we brought it home and we played it.

469
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,430
Scott: It's for two to five players.

470
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:49,903
Scott: We played it mostly two player, but we've played it more than that.

471
00:27:50,023 --> 00:27:51,852
Scott: At least once or twice shows this to me.

472
00:27:51,892 --> 00:27:57,212
Rym: And he's like, it's a co-op game and it's really straight forward.

473
00:27:57,353 --> 00:28:02,473
Scott: At first I read the rules and on reading the rules, I said, I suppose I started reading the rules.

474
00:28:02,493 --> 00:28:06,208
Scott: I was like, Oh shit, it's fucking pandemic shadows over Camela.

475
00:28:06,228 --> 00:28:13,171
Scott: And then I kept reading and I was like, this has a possibility of fixing that problem while still being that game.

476
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:16,502
Scott: So I didn't know until I actually played it with Rym.

477
00:28:17,083 --> 00:28:17,925
Scott: to confirm the truth.

478
00:28:18,346 --> 00:28:26,588
Rym: The game gives you explicit detailed rules on what information you can and cannot share.

479
00:28:26,949 --> 00:28:32,305
Rym: And more importantly, the sharing of the information is a game mechanic.

480
00:28:32,346 --> 00:28:36,297
Rym: You spend a token to tell someone a piece of information.

481
00:28:36,638 --> 00:28:36,838
Scott: Yep.

482
00:28:37,179 --> 00:28:48,920
Scott: Also, it explicitly says in the rules quote, if you follow the rules closely, you can only communicate with your teammates when you give them information, placing a blue token period.

483
00:28:49,401 --> 00:28:53,156
Scott: In other words, there is no ambiguity over what you can and can't say.

484
00:28:53,236 --> 00:28:54,200
Scott: Can I use codes?

485
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,805
Scott: Can I say things like this?

486
00:28:56,046 --> 00:28:58,093
Scott: No, it's like you cannot communicate.

487
00:28:58,454 --> 00:29:01,524
Scott: That is as firm a statement as I have ever heard.

488
00:29:01,645 --> 00:29:07,063
Rym: Now at the same time, it is impossible as humans to not communicate.

489
00:29:07,183 --> 00:29:14,649
Rym: Because for example, I'll draw a card and everyone else at the table goes, Oh, that actually is useful information.

490
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:15,170
Scott: It is.

491
00:29:15,612 --> 00:29:20,086
Scott: Or I'll be like, Hey Rym, you have one red card.

492
00:29:20,226 --> 00:29:21,812
Scott: Now I'll be thinking one red card.

493
00:29:22,013 --> 00:29:24,542
Rym: If Scott says that on my turn, here's my thought process.

494
00:29:25,045 --> 00:29:32,034
Rym: Scott wouldn't have told me that unless he had a reason to tell me, I'm going to assume that he's smart and I'm just going to play this card blindly.

495
00:29:32,054 --> 00:29:34,725
Scott: Oh, so let's get back to the game.

496
00:29:35,026 --> 00:29:36,692
Scott: So it's Hanabi, right?

497
00:29:36,712 --> 00:29:38,479
Scott: Which is the Japanese word for fireworks.

498
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:39,784
Scott: It's got a fireworks theme.

499
00:29:40,165 --> 00:29:48,336
Scott: And the idea is that everyone who's playing the game is cooperatively trying to set off a fireworks display and to set up a fireworks display.

500
00:29:48,376 --> 00:29:55,610
Scott: There are five colors of cards numbered one through five, and you want to play the one, then the two, then the three, then the four, then the five of each color.

501
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:57,622
Scott: And you're working on all the fireworks at the same time.

502
00:29:57,663 --> 00:30:00,316
Scott: So at the beginning of the game, playing any one is good.

503
00:30:00,336 --> 00:30:03,951
Scott: You know, once you've got some ones down, playing a two is good.

504
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:06,722
Scott: As long as the one of that color is already down and so on.

505
00:30:07,103 --> 00:30:10,275
Scott: When you play a five, that firework goes off and you're all set.

506
00:30:11,118 --> 00:30:11,720
Scott: Here's the catch.

507
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,124
Scott: Everyone draws cards.

508
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:19,045
Scott: And on your turn, you can either a play one B discard one or C give someone information.

509
00:30:19,065 --> 00:30:20,412
Scott: Well, why am I giving you information?

510
00:30:20,433 --> 00:30:22,463
Scott: Because you can never look at your own car.

511
00:30:22,483 --> 00:30:27,907
Rym: You know how many times when we first started playing this, I would draw cards instinctively look at it.

512
00:30:27,968 --> 00:30:33,750
Scott: Yeah, you can never, ever, ever under any circumstance, no rule whatsoever allows you to look at your own cards.

513
00:30:34,272 --> 00:30:35,416
Rym: Some guys made a clever.

514
00:30:35,456 --> 00:30:39,651
Rym: They made stands to face the cards outward at everyone else.

515
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,641
Scott: Yeah, I like to hold in my hands so I can arrange them.

516
00:30:42,741 --> 00:30:55,822
Scott: I have this complicated three dimensional lattice where I'll hold the cards to remember what cards in between different fingers to remember what they are after people tell me about them, because even after they tell me about them, he said, someone tells me, OK, Scott, you have two reds.

517
00:30:56,163 --> 00:31:01,724
Scott: I got to remember I have two reds and that those are the two reds and the before one of those was a three.

518
00:31:01,744 --> 00:31:02,467
Rym: Yeah.

519
00:31:02,769 --> 00:31:05,260
Scott: So this one's a red three and this one's a red question mark number.

520
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,645
Scott: OK, yeah.

521
00:31:07,107 --> 00:31:09,215
Scott: And so I got to keep shuffling these cards around in my hand.

522
00:31:09,255 --> 00:31:13,454
Scott: And then if I spend a whole bunch of turns giving other people information, I got it.

523
00:31:13,715 --> 00:31:15,322
Scott: If I forget what I've got in my hand.

524
00:31:15,342 --> 00:31:16,506
Scott: Oh, shit, we're fucked.

525
00:31:16,968 --> 00:31:22,169
Rym: Now there's these tokens and basically you have to spend a token to give someone information.

526
00:31:22,189 --> 00:31:24,801
Scott: There are only eight clock tokens at the beginning of the game.

527
00:31:25,102 --> 00:31:26,366
Rym: And you give a piece of information.

528
00:31:26,506 --> 00:31:32,524
Rym: All you can say is how many of a card you point at of a number or color do they have?

529
00:31:32,545 --> 00:31:37,340
Rym: So I could say these three cards are red or this card is a one.

530
00:31:37,923 --> 00:31:39,640
Rym: You must give complete information.

531
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:43,420
Scott: So if someone has three ones, you can't be like you got two ones or you got one one.

532
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,765
Scott: No, it's you got three ones.

533
00:31:44,805 --> 00:31:49,204
Rym: if they have three ones and you can't say anything about a card you can't point out.

534
00:31:49,245 --> 00:31:51,739
Rym: So I cannot say, Scott, you have no ones.

535
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:54,353
Scott: Yep, because that would not include pointing.

536
00:31:54,373 --> 00:31:55,680
Scott: You have to point at cards.

537
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:56,621
Scott: Right.

538
00:31:56,762 --> 00:32:01,720
Scott: You could say you can be like you have one green, you have two red and you only get to give one fact each clock.

539
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:04,919
Scott: You say color or number, color or number one fact.

540
00:32:05,101 --> 00:32:06,879
Scott: So I so spend the clock.

541
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,700
Scott: Tell Remy has two reds point at the two cards that are the red ones.

542
00:32:11,061 --> 00:32:12,812
Scott: It's up to him to remember that those two are red.

543
00:32:12,832 --> 00:32:14,180
Scott: and now it's not my turn anymore.

544
00:32:14,901 --> 00:32:15,287
Scott: That's it.

545
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:16,079
Scott: That's a whole turn.

546
00:32:16,261 --> 00:32:19,100
Rym: You get into this great cycle where Scott gives me a piece of information.

547
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:19,846
Rym: I play a card.

548
00:32:19,947 --> 00:32:21,120
Rym: Scott gives me a piece of information.

549
00:32:21,221 --> 00:32:21,868
Rym: I play a card.

550
00:32:22,151 --> 00:32:22,980
Rym: There's no more tokens.

551
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,559
Rym: This guy doesn't know shit about his hand.

552
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,704
Rym: Yeah, great.

553
00:32:26,086 --> 00:32:29,000
Scott: Well, you have to do is basically you have to remember that card you have to play.

554
00:32:29,182 --> 00:32:30,620
Scott: Oh, give me an information.

555
00:32:30,922 --> 00:32:31,810
Scott: Then I play one.

556
00:32:32,032 --> 00:32:32,920
Scott: Then you play one.

557
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,340
Scott: Two other confounding factors.

558
00:32:34,801 --> 00:32:38,780
Rym: There's three ones, two of every other number and only one five.

559
00:32:38,941 --> 00:32:41,739
Rym: So if you discard a five, fuck, you can't get a top score.

560
00:32:42,383 --> 00:32:43,739
Scott: You can't get the maximum score.

561
00:32:44,381 --> 00:32:48,120
Scott: But at the same time, if you discard two of anything else, you can't get the top score.

562
00:32:48,161 --> 00:32:49,599
Scott: You discard two green fours.

563
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:50,241
Scott: Well, green.

564
00:32:50,322 --> 00:32:56,220
Scott: I guess if you discard all three ones of something, I've never had a game where all the ones didn't get played.

565
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,408
Rym: I can't imagine that happening.

566
00:32:57,468 --> 00:32:59,080
Scott: You had to be so dumb for that to happen.

567
00:33:00,223 --> 00:33:01,700
Scott: But yeah, we've never gotten a twenty five.

568
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:04,760
Scott: The most we got is twenty two and usually we get nineteen or twenty.

569
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:08,740
Rym: The first time we played, we got a twenty and that's why this game is great.

570
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:17,660
Rym: Now you can get a score of zero because if you play a card that doesn't work, for example, I play a red three and the red two is not there and open.

571
00:33:18,084 --> 00:33:19,500
Scott: That's a. that's a wrong play.

572
00:33:19,962 --> 00:33:22,260
Scott: The three goes in the garbage and we lose a fuse.

573
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,700
Scott: And once you lose the third fuse game over, you get a score of zero.

574
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:30,024
Rym: So the way we played this game and it's telling.

575
00:33:30,124 --> 00:33:45,500
Rym: I really want to watch people who don't listen to this show that we're doing right now and who aren't kind of, I don't know, into analyzing games like we are, because it's interesting to see how they would approach a game like this.

576
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:53,420
Rym: Because we approached it so methodically without any preparation or forethought that I was kind of amazed, like Scott and I and our friend Alex.

577
00:33:53,661 --> 00:33:58,720
Rym: When we sat down to play, it was just assumed if someone told someone about one card, they should play it.

578
00:33:58,981 --> 00:34:02,080
Rym: If someone told them about two cards, they would keep that information aside.

579
00:34:02,621 --> 00:34:08,060
Rym: And all these sort of obvious strategies just emerged immediately and automatically.

580
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,600
Scott: Yeah, there's all these sort of implications, right?

581
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:17,100
Scott: The other thing you have to do is you have to pay attention to the discard pile and also the cards that are face up and the cards in other people's hands.

582
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:17,440
Scott: Right.

583
00:34:17,842 --> 00:34:25,659
Scott: If someone tells me I have two reds, I look at the table and I see, OK, these can't be ones because I see all three red ones.

584
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:26,649
Scott: Rims holding one.

585
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:27,679
Scott: There's one on the table.

586
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,627
Scott: There's one in the discard.

587
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:29,998
Scott: So these are not ones.

588
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:31,185
Scott: Are they twos?

589
00:34:31,507 --> 00:34:34,000
Scott: Well, there's only one two on the table in the discard pile.

590
00:34:34,301 --> 00:34:36,132
Scott: So I don't want to discard either one of these.

591
00:34:36,393 --> 00:34:37,480
Scott: if it's the other two are fucked.

592
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,911
Rym: But you don't know which one of them.

593
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:39,938
Scott: I don't know which one it is.

594
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:41,870
Scott: It could be a three.

595
00:34:42,172 --> 00:34:43,159
Scott: Yes, it could be a three.

596
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,045
Scott: Could it be a five?

597
00:34:44,126 --> 00:34:46,020
Scott: No, because Alex is holding the red five.

598
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,039
Scott: So these are twos, threes or fours.

599
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:48,962
Scott: I don't know which ones.

600
00:34:49,464 --> 00:34:55,340
Rym: So that means, you know, rather than playing or discarding either one of them, you'll discard some other card.

601
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:07,820
Rym: Now, it's hard to say if this is cheating, but I rapidly fell upon a strategy that I follow without fail no matter what when I play this game, which is the newest card that I have drawn.

602
00:35:08,341 --> 00:35:20,560
Rym: Unless someone gives me information about it is the first one I will discard if I have to discard a card, because I assume my smart friends would tell me if the card were importance.

603
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:26,200
Scott: There's another thing that I do, right, is I keep track of which card is the card I just drew.

604
00:35:26,682 --> 00:35:30,239
Scott: So let's say, for example, I have in my hand like a red two.

605
00:35:30,802 --> 00:35:31,024
Scott: Right.

606
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:33,199
Scott: And we've already played a red two.

607
00:35:33,501 --> 00:35:36,459
Scott: So no one's really going to waste a clock to tell me about it.

608
00:35:36,681 --> 00:35:36,842
Scott: Right.

609
00:35:36,863 --> 00:35:38,600
Scott: Just so I'll discard it to get a clock back.

610
00:35:38,841 --> 00:35:40,880
Scott: That's sort of a wasted action is not very efficient.

611
00:35:41,041 --> 00:35:41,242
Scott: Right.

612
00:35:41,684 --> 00:35:44,680
Scott: Let's say I draw a red three, which we haven't played yet.

613
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:50,039
Scott: Somebody is going to want to tell me that I have one point at that card so that I play it.

614
00:35:50,761 --> 00:35:52,600
Scott: But let's say I have another three in my hand.

615
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:53,266
Scott: What are they going to do?

616
00:35:53,306 --> 00:35:54,558
Scott: Tell me that I have two threes.

617
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,966
Scott: I don't know which one now.

618
00:35:56,248 --> 00:35:58,100
Scott: Are they going to tell me I have two red cards?

619
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:03,100
Scott: Well, if they tell me I have two red cards and I know that one of them is the one I just played.

620
00:36:03,381 --> 00:36:05,539
Scott: And one of them is one that's been sitting in my hand the whole game.

621
00:36:06,101 --> 00:36:13,520
Scott: Now I can imply that one that I recently drew must be interesting for them to suddenly tell me I had two red cards.

622
00:36:14,021 --> 00:36:14,323
Scott: Right.

623
00:36:14,686 --> 00:36:16,639
Scott: When I already knew about this other one.

624
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:22,859
Rym: Now, it was funny because we played this game with another friend of ours who hasn't played as many of these kinds of games with us.

625
00:36:23,501 --> 00:36:26,000
Rym: Equally smart, just hasn't played in our gaming culture.

626
00:36:26,622 --> 00:36:29,160
Rym: And she took the opposite meaning.

627
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:40,160
Rym: We pointed out information about one card and she assumed we were telling her to get rid of that shit and immediately corrected that and played the rest of the game identically to the way we were playing.

628
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:46,360
Rym: So you'll be able to watch groups of friends converge on strategies in an unspoken manner.

629
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:53,360
Scott: Yeah, but it's like nobody's using, you know, the thing you worry about, like secret winking codes to like just so that they know what's in their hand exactly.

630
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,620
Scott: You're cheating like that, right?

631
00:36:54,841 --> 00:36:56,180
Scott: You're not allowed to communicate.

632
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,660
Rym: I make a really good effort to poker face it.

633
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:03,420
Rym: Like if I I mean, I'll say something like, oh, yeah, you are not allowed to communicate.

634
00:37:03,501 --> 00:37:04,030
Scott: That's cheating.

635
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:04,700
Scott: And it's co-ops.

636
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,219
Scott: You're only cheating yourself if you cheat.

637
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:06,441
Scott: Right.

638
00:37:06,461 --> 00:37:09,360
Scott: You know, it's no traitor like in Shadows Over Camelot.

639
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,599
Scott: It's like you're just cheating yourself.

640
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:20,800
Rym: But if it goes around the table and nobody's happy for all their turns and no one's really playing anything, then you can assume that all the cards in your hand are bullshit in some manner.

641
00:37:21,181 --> 00:37:24,680
Scott: You also need to tell people right away if they have fives, so they keep them safe.

642
00:37:25,144 --> 00:37:25,977
Scott: That's your only secret.

643
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:41,600
Scott: Your only chance of getting a really high score is to actually play some of the fives, because when you play a five, you get a clock back and you only other way to get a clock back is to discard a card and discarding a card while it gets you a clock back and clears out your hand and allows you to draw into new cards that you need to play.

644
00:37:42,201 --> 00:37:45,200
Scott: Also hastens the end of the game without scoring you any points.

645
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,500
Rym: So two points you need to increase to win this game.

646
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:55,980
Scott: You need to increase the number of actions you spend playing cards and decrease the number of actions you spend giving information and discarding.

647
00:37:56,341 --> 00:37:58,720
Rym: So I have two big points to make about this game.

648
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:11,180
Rym: Point number one, a perfect score basically will come down to luck in the same way that coincidentally enough, the most recent book club book before this one, Player of Games, getting a full web.

649
00:38:11,802 --> 00:38:13,020
Rym: Everyone knew how to do it.

650
00:38:13,081 --> 00:38:14,560
Rym: It just needed the right circumstances.

651
00:38:14,782 --> 00:38:15,015
Scott: Exactly.

652
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,620
Rym: You need the right circumstances to get a perfect score.

653
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,419
Scott: You need to get a draw.

654
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:24,140
Scott: A lot of games I've played, like I played a game with the Netrunner people, right, who are also equally smart at gaming.

655
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,899
Scott: They all knew what was going on right away.

656
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:29,639
Scott: And someone just drew like four or fives at the get go.

657
00:38:30,402 --> 00:38:33,720
Scott: And it's like, all right, that really bones us, right?

658
00:38:34,121 --> 00:38:35,000
Rym: But you have four or fives.

659
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:35,859
Rym: Don't discard those.

660
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:37,660
Rym: Be useless for most of the rest of the game.

661
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,140
Scott: It's possible with that, with like you play with a bunch of people.

662
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:44,460
Scott: Everyone can draw like one, two, one, one, one, two, one, three, one, four, all different colors.

663
00:38:44,881 --> 00:38:50,680
Scott: And you can spend like the whole beginning of the game easily just playing them all really rapidly without any issues whatsoever.

664
00:38:51,181 --> 00:38:53,079
Rym: I feel like we almost thought about doing this.

665
00:38:53,260 --> 00:39:12,240
Rym: We can make a YouTube video where we show like strategy and Hanabi, but it would be awesome to some friends with a choreographed play where we've memorized the deck and basically just play it out, like make up logic, like sit there and be like, well, because you said this and you said this and you said this, I can infer therefore this and just play a perfect game without even thinking.

666
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:17,859
Rym: But that would have been more effort than just playing the game until we eventually luck out and max it out.

667
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:32,720
Rym: Point number two is that if you play this game a lot with your friends and you're getting scores about 20 and up regularly, you've basically solved the game.

668
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,281
Scott: I think at that point, I want to keep playing until I get a 25.

669
00:39:36,281 --> 00:39:36,677
Scott: I do as well.

670
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,495
Scott: But yeah, I don't think it's actually possible to get 25 regular.

671
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,999
Scott: You need to have that good draw.

672
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:42,663
Scott: Right.

673
00:39:43,025 --> 00:39:45,600
Scott: And it's you're not going to get that good draw all the time.

674
00:39:45,722 --> 00:39:46,559
Scott: It's just not going to happen.

675
00:39:46,903 --> 00:39:48,620
Rym: Now, it is still possible in those situations.

676
00:39:48,800 --> 00:40:07,180
Rym: But the best part about this game is that situation where you're looking at someone's cards or everyone's cards and you know, any piece of information you give them just because of the luck of what is in their hands will cause them to do a thing you don't want them to do because they will infer the wrong thing.

677
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,960
Rym: That is the worst feeling in the world.

678
00:40:10,381 --> 00:40:15,240
Scott: That's why that's exactly why you might think that all this inferred information, right?

679
00:40:15,481 --> 00:40:20,260
Scott: This sort of wink, wink, nudge, nudge is communication that is outside the bounds of the rules.

680
00:40:20,622 --> 00:40:21,856
Scott: But no, it's perfectly OK.

681
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:28,840
Scott: And it's the point of the game is because that nudge, nudge, wink, wink is going to bite you as much as it's going to help you.

682
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,919
Rym: You're going to find yourself thinking at many points, is Scott as smart as I have always assumed him to be?

683
00:40:34,802 --> 00:40:37,760
Rym: And then you say a piece of information and just hope against hope.

684
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,380
Scott: If I tell him he has one green, what is the context of that?

685
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,079
Scott: What information does Rym have?

686
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,300
Scott: You know, what decision will he make?

687
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,265
Scott: I can't make him.

688
00:40:46,405 --> 00:40:48,820
Scott: all I can do is tell him he has one green and point at it.

689
00:40:49,081 --> 00:40:55,280
Scott: I can maybe say it with emphasis like you have one green card, Rym one, one green card.

690
00:40:55,681 --> 00:40:59,400
Scott: And I can make all kinds of faces, but I can't say discard it.

691
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,358
Scott: I can't say play it.

692
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:00,822
Scott: I can't.

693
00:41:01,203 --> 00:41:04,740
Scott: you know, we could if we come with a signal system again, we're cheating ourselves.

694
00:41:05,241 --> 00:41:05,503
Scott: Right.

695
00:41:05,865 --> 00:41:07,919
Scott: So what is he going to make of that?

696
00:41:08,481 --> 00:41:12,799
Scott: You know, we had a system before where that meant play it and I want him to discard it.

697
00:41:13,545 --> 00:41:14,051
Scott: Now, what?

698
00:41:14,557 --> 00:41:14,780
Scott: Yep.

699
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:15,421
Scott: Now what?

700
00:41:16,142 --> 00:41:26,300
Rym: It's sort of the quantum information problem of if you prearrange your quantum states to use for communication, you've basically undermined the whole idea of quantum communication.

701
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:31,460
Scott: So side note about this game, it is made and designed by Antoine Bousa.

702
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,199
Scott: Do you know who Antoine Bousa is?

703
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,514
Rym: Why, Antoine Bousa?

704
00:41:35,161 --> 00:41:36,360
Rym: I was trying to look him up on board game.

705
00:41:36,581 --> 00:41:37,170
Rym: He is a user.

706
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:37,819
Rym: That didn't help me.

707
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,826
Scott: He is a user.

708
00:41:38,847 --> 00:41:40,760
Scott: But if you scroll down, you'll see the games he made.

709
00:41:41,683 --> 00:41:43,139
Scott: He is the seven wonders guy.

710
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,067
Rym: Smart guy.

711
00:41:44,209 --> 00:41:44,979
Scott: Seven wonders guy.

712
00:41:45,101 --> 00:41:47,500
Scott: So look forward to anything from Antoine Bousa.

713
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:53,840
Scott: If he made seven wonders in Hanabi and has a spiel this yar guy is going places in the game design world.

714
00:41:54,361 --> 00:41:54,882
Rym: Absolutely.

715
00:41:54,902 --> 00:42:00,760
Rym: This game, if I had to describe the brain also is incredibly stressful to play.

716
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:03,260
Rym: You are putting your full attention.

717
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:09,840
Rym: If you fuck up and start thinking about biscuits, you're going to forget which one of those two cards you put to the sides of four.

718
00:42:10,564 --> 00:42:11,188
Rym: And then you're fucked.

719
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:13,080
Rym: And Scott and I have both done that.

720
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:19,700
Rym: The whole at one point, Scott had a white four, the last one, a green four and a red four in his hand.

721
00:42:20,481 --> 00:42:25,140
Rym: And he he should have known that which one was the white four from previous information.

722
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,600
Rym: But I think he mixed them up because he's flipping around.

723
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,959
Rym: He's like, I know I can discard one of these fours.

724
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:32,920
Rym: And he's holding him in his hands and then he's holding the white one.

725
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:36,540
Rym: He's like, so I can't discard the white one.

726
00:42:36,902 --> 00:42:38,619
Rym: And I know this isn't the white one.

727
00:42:39,442 --> 00:42:41,580
Rym: And the whole time I'm just trying not to make a face.

728
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,692
Rym: I'm just like, please don't fuck up.

729
00:42:42,732 --> 00:42:43,319
Rym: Please don't fuck up.

730
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:44,065
Rym: Please don't fuck up.

731
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:45,698
Rym: We got really lucky that time.

732
00:42:47,861 --> 00:42:53,420
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know, I can't communicate with anyone about what's in their hand, but I can say about what's in my hand.

733
00:42:53,481 --> 00:42:53,664
Scott: Right.

734
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:54,760
Scott: That doesn't help anyone.

735
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:55,341
Scott: Right.

736
00:42:55,803 --> 00:43:01,320
Scott: So it's like just during my turn, I'll be like, all right, I'm saying what I'm thinking and moving cards around.

737
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,388
Scott: No one can help me.

738
00:43:02,408 --> 00:43:03,759
Scott: I'm all on my own.

739
00:43:04,462 --> 00:43:04,804
Scott: Right.

740
00:43:05,185 --> 00:43:08,800
Scott: But I think that adds a lot of fun in giving the other people the experience.

741
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:15,720
Scott: You just said of, you know, being tortured by me being wrong or being amazed by me being right.

742
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,947
Rym: Like I fucked up and I'm also.

743
00:43:18,248 --> 00:43:21,480
Rym: I put a five to the side in my hand way early in the game.

744
00:43:21,863 --> 00:43:23,419
Rym: And at one point I must have just moved it.

745
00:43:23,922 --> 00:43:26,040
Rym: And then later I was like, all right, play in the five.

746
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:26,746
Rym: And I throw it down.

747
00:43:26,786 --> 00:43:28,420
Rym: It's like a two that we needed.

748
00:43:28,621 --> 00:43:29,464
Rym: And the game was fucked.

749
00:43:29,625 --> 00:43:33,400
Rym: And I just said, no, I just I envisioned it as a five.

750
00:43:33,681 --> 00:43:39,840
Rym: I threw it down and I saw for a split second a five until my brain was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

751
00:43:40,301 --> 00:43:41,023
Rym: That doesn't match.

752
00:43:41,605 --> 00:43:46,740
Rym: The eyes are giving us reports that perhaps you have fucked up waiting for confirmation.

753
00:43:47,304 --> 00:43:48,439
Rym: Yes, you have fucked up.

754
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:59,360
Scott: Well, the other reason that I say what I'm thinking on my turn out loud when it's a complicated turn is to demonstrate and educate the other players as to how I think they should think about their hands.

755
00:43:59,741 --> 00:43:59,981
Scott: Right.

756
00:44:00,001 --> 00:44:07,518
Scott: Like if I say, oh, I'm discarding this because I see what's on the table and now I'm showing other people, look, look at the table and make decisions.

757
00:44:07,538 --> 00:44:08,620
Scott: the same way I'm making them.

758
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:12,500
Scott: I'm not giving you specific information about your hand as it currently is and cheating.

759
00:44:13,161 --> 00:44:21,340
Scott: I'm giving you basically generic game tips, how to decide with the information that you have legally what to do the same way that I'm deciding what to do.

760
00:44:22,742 --> 00:44:25,520
Rym: The game is an excellent teaching tool.

761
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:26,996
Scott: You don't want to spill this out when you suck.

762
00:44:27,076 --> 00:44:27,360
Scott: so far.

763
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:29,640
Scott: I've never seen a sucky spill to see our game with this game.

764
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,782
Scott: Some years are better than others, but still, this is

765
00:44:31,802 --> 00:44:46,860
Rym: the kind of game that if I was teaching like game design or game play at like a college, I would make the class play this game and I would make them write papers on it and play it and practice it and try to get good at it because it illustrates card counting.

766
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:52,740
Rym: It illustrates what information is and is not conveyed by certain pieces of information.

767
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,660
Rym: It teaches you kind of from the other side how to solve simple games.

768
00:44:58,561 --> 00:45:02,300
Scott: It's also, you know, there are a lot of people I've met in the gaming world.

769
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:07,540
Scott: It's hard to get them to play games because they sort of have anti-competitive bones in their body.

770
00:45:08,221 --> 00:45:15,340
Scott: And it's hard to get them to play tabletop games because that are good because they're usually competitive and the co-op games are not good.

771
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:26,780
Scott: And this is finally sort of a, you know, a cooperative game that engages a lot of those brain muscles that are used in a serious competitive game, like, say, a Puerto Rico.

772
00:45:27,421 --> 00:45:30,299
Scott: So it's a way to bring those people into the tabletop fold.

773
00:45:31,161 --> 00:45:37,600
Scott: You know, I think, you know, Settlers is a gateway game for the people to move from like a regular board game to a euro game who are kind of competitive.

774
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:45,920
Scott: I think this is actually sort of my new go-to gateway game to bring in those people who are like averse to competition.

775
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,600
Rym: Though Spotted serves that purpose well because losing doesn't feel like losing.

776
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:50,241
Scott: Well, yes.

777
00:45:50,261 --> 00:45:54,240
Scott: So are the Cards Against Humanities and actually King of Tokyo sort of is not too bad.

778
00:45:54,701 --> 00:45:57,260
Scott: Yeah, but King of Tokyo, I don't like it as good.

779
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:02,400
Scott: I don't like it as much as an intro game because of all the stack of cards with all the random powers.

780
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:07,020
Rym: Well, King of Tokyo also has a problem we didn't anticipate.

781
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:14,660
Rym: We talked about this on the show that almost everyone younger than us that we know has never played Yahtzee in their lives, which I'm just amazed by.

782
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:16,400
Scott: You got a Yahtzee thing going on lately.

783
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:17,081
Rym: I know.

784
00:46:17,462 --> 00:46:24,980
Rym: So I have a closing question for all you kids out there in case you don't see our panel at PAXOS and we die and the footage is lost.

785
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:36,720
Rym: Does it matter if you take turns playing Yahtzee like the book says, or if you just play it all solitaire at the table, like turn by turn, and then at the end count up your scores?

786
00:46:37,001 --> 00:46:41,019
Rym: Is there any reason you should play completely singularly?

787
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:41,323
Scott: I know.

788
00:46:41,364 --> 00:46:41,712
Scott: Pick me.

789
00:46:41,753 --> 00:46:42,039
Scott: Pick me.

790
00:46:42,202 --> 00:46:43,359
Scott: Of course you know, ass.

791
00:46:44,303 --> 00:46:44,549
Scott: I know.

792
00:46:44,569 --> 00:46:44,918
Scott: Pick me.

793
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:48,960
Rym: All right, guys, hopefully we'll see at least one or two of you in Australia.

794
00:46:50,242 --> 00:46:53,680
Rym: And if you're if you're someone who likes games, you should own Hanabi.

795
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,320
Rym: Just buy it and keep it in your repertoire.

796
00:46:55,903 --> 00:46:57,499
Scott: It's a tiny little game.

797
00:46:58,182 --> 00:47:00,620
Scott: It's probably the most game in the least box, right?

798
00:47:00,681 --> 00:47:02,179
Scott: Any other game in this size box.

799
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:03,894
Scott: I mean, this is better than No.

800
00:47:03,934 --> 00:47:04,519
Scott: Thanks, right?

801
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,640
Scott: Bonanza would be accepted as a bigger box.

802
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,038
Rym: It comes in too big of a box.

803
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,379
Scott: Bonanza is in a bigger box.

804
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:14,039
Scott: I think this is the most game in the least box I've ever seen.

805
00:47:14,821 --> 00:47:16,460
Rym: I mean, there's expansions within two.

806
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,920
Rym: You can add these colored fireworks.

807
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,659
Scott: Oh, we haven't even gone into that show.

808
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:20,175
Scott: My God.

809
00:47:20,601 --> 00:47:22,959
Scott: Because now when we get a twenty five, then we'll go for that.

810
00:47:23,321 --> 00:47:27,639
Rym: Yeah, basically the game gives you the game includes hard mode.

811
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:29,440
Scott: Coops for hard modes.

812
00:47:29,681 --> 00:47:32,638
Scott: Fuck all four of them right in the ass.

813
00:47:33,866 --> 00:47:34,231
Scott: Oh, good.

814
00:47:34,251 --> 00:47:34,860
Rym: Yeah.

815
00:47:35,321 --> 00:47:41,959
Scott: But, you know, hey, for a game that it's sort of like, oh, I get twenty five and I never play it again, it's like, no, get twenty five, then do bitch mode.

816
00:47:49,512 --> 00:47:51,650
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

817
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:54,070
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music.

818
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:56,830
Rym: Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

819
00:47:57,170 --> 00:48:02,189
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at front row crew dot com for show notes, discussion news and more.

820
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:05,130
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

821
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:09,829
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

823
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:17,649
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

824
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:20,810
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
