1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,364
Rym: It's Monday, June 16th.

2
00:00:11,765 --> 00:00:12,246
Scott: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,427 --> 00:00:15,234
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights Mondays.

4
00:00:15,294 --> 00:00:17,740
Rym: Tonight, it's a Tech News round-up.

5
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:26,918
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,921 --> 00:00:32,151
Scott: You know what I did at work today?

7
00:00:32,351 --> 00:00:33,300
Rym: What did you do, work?

8
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:39,100
Scott: No, I did actually work, but while I was working, I was watching Tiger Woods.

9
00:00:39,781 --> 00:00:41,530
Rym: You know, I was working.

10
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,040
Rym: I had a lot to do and I was really busy at work, so I'm typing furiously and doing my thing.

11
00:00:47,061 --> 00:00:47,604
Rym: There's a meeting.

12
00:00:47,805 --> 00:00:52,180
Rym: My boss and my boss's boss and a bunch of other people are in the conference room, which I think I've talked about.

13
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,140
Scott: Has a satellite dish hooked up to a television?

14
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:54,744
Rym: Oh, no, no.

15
00:00:54,764 --> 00:00:56,319
Rym: Well, yeah, but not for that.

16
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,444
Scott: Oh, because ours does.

17
00:00:57,645 --> 00:00:58,529
Scott: We have Dish Network.

18
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,439
Scott: Well, I think we have DirecTV in our conference room.

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:07,020
Rym: But it's a conference room, but like I've said before, my entire office is one big room with all glass walls and glass doors.

20
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,164
Rym: It's really cool.

21
00:01:08,727 --> 00:01:20,060
Rym: So, I noticed, like I kind of looked to see if they're going to be done yet, because I got to talk to my boss about something before I go and I see that they're all looking behind me and not talking about whatever they're talking about.

22
00:01:20,421 --> 00:01:29,160
Rym: So, I look behind me and I see all the salespeople and the customer support people and they're all standing and it looks like they're all watching one guy's computer.

23
00:01:29,761 --> 00:01:34,740
Rym: So, my boss's boss walks out and he's like, "What are you guys doing watching so-and-so do some work?

24
00:01:35,302 --> 00:01:36,514
Rym: Maybe you could take a hint and

25
00:01:36,575 --> 00:01:36,756
Rym: work.".

26
00:01:39,543 --> 00:01:41,358
Rym: And then he comes like, "All right, guys, what are you really looking

27
00:01:41,418 --> 00:01:41,499
Rym: at?".

28
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:45,112
Rym: And we're watching the sudden death whatever.

29
00:01:45,293 --> 00:01:47,420
Rym: I didn't even know golf had a sudden death.

30
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,306
Scott: Well, see, here.

31
00:01:48,407 --> 00:01:49,620
Scott: Oh, let me explain it to you, then.

32
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,705
Rym: Oh, I know how it works now.

33
00:01:51,248 --> 00:01:53,037
Rym: Someone at work explained it to me and I was like, "Oh,

34
00:01:53,057 --> 00:01:53,298
Rym: wow.".

35
00:01:53,801 --> 00:01:57,220
Rym: And then I watched it because that golf was suddenly really interesting.

36
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,283
Scott: Well, see, here's the thing.

37
00:01:58,423 --> 00:02:00,511
Scott: Golf as a sport, right?

38
00:02:00,572 --> 00:02:02,740
Scott: Especially while, I mean, playing it can be fun.

39
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:08,680
Scott: You know, actually, I would play golf if, number one, it was significantly less expensive.

40
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,260
Scott: Number two, it took a lot less time to play.

41
00:02:12,721 --> 00:02:18,260
Scott: Number three, I could just walk up and play and not have to call up and get a tee time and then wake up at the crack ass at dawn.

42
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,620
Rym: One, it is cheap to play if you use used clubs and play in crappy places.

43
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,880
Scott: Which is not worth playing because then the game sucks.

44
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,697
Rym: When it's raining.

45
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,320
Scott: It sucks even worse, then.

46
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,380
Rym: Two, it takes a long time on purpose because people play golf to get away from their real lives.

47
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:31,829
Scott: I know.

48
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,960
Rym: And most people who play golf seem to play just as an excuse to hang out.

49
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:36,347
Rym: Yup.

50
00:02:36,367 --> 00:02:37,080
Scott: Yeah, it's true.

51
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,875
Scott: I feel, though, like if we make, we could design a golf course, right?

52
00:02:41,237 --> 00:02:41,940
Scott: In such a way.

53
00:02:42,281 --> 00:02:42,684
Rym: Oh, I know.

54
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,179
Rym: You know, you designed a giant mini golf course.

55
00:02:45,501 --> 00:02:45,803
Scott: Well, no.

56
00:02:45,823 --> 00:02:48,060
Scott: What I would do is I would have normal golf holes, right?

57
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:53,360
Scott: But half the holes take you away from sort of the main base and the other half bring you towards it.

58
00:02:53,721 --> 00:02:57,760
Scott: And then you could send people, like the first people who show up, you send them to hole one.

59
00:02:58,021 --> 00:03:00,960
Scott: The second group that shows up, you send them to hole three, you see?

60
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,640
Scott: And you can sort of, and you make people play fast and you can...

61
00:03:04,861 --> 00:03:07,120
Rym: Well, you've already lost every golfer.

62
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:11,440
Scott: Well, you lost people who are golfers now, but you might get a whole new bunch of golfers regardless.

63
00:03:11,961 --> 00:03:12,163
Scott: Right?

64
00:03:12,405 --> 00:03:14,080
Scott: Golf is not that interesting to watch.

65
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,400
Scott: The action of golf is not exciting, right?

66
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:16,621
Scott: It's.

67
00:03:16,943 --> 00:03:22,480
Scott: it's not like a hockey game where you can watch a crappy high school hockey game, but the action will be awesome enough to entertain.

68
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,497
Rym: He's he's he's he's he punts.

69
00:03:25,043 --> 00:03:25,307
Scott: Right.

70
00:03:25,429 --> 00:03:25,936
Scott: It goes in.

71
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,133
Scott: Hey, he went in.

72
00:03:27,821 --> 00:03:35,979
Scott: But because right of the the insane drama of who is playing and what the stakes and the circumstances were.

73
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,102
Scott: Right.

74
00:03:37,122 --> 00:03:42,540
Scott: The just the drama in itself of who's going to win and who's going to lose is enough to make you watch.

75
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:43,820
Scott: And all it all.

76
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:47,080
Rym: The only thing that got me to watch was the fact that it was sudden death.

77
00:03:47,521 --> 00:03:47,763
Scott: Right.

78
00:03:47,863 --> 00:03:50,220
Scott: Because then it was even worse sudden death than you think.

79
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:57,680
Scott: As I will explain, you see, Tiger Woods hasn't played golf, not at a tournament in like months because he was having some knee surgeries.

80
00:03:58,121 --> 00:03:58,363
Scott: Right.

81
00:03:58,825 --> 00:04:01,160
Scott: He said, I'm going to take off until the U.S.

82
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,100
Scott: Open because that's important and I want to win that really badly.

83
00:04:04,501 --> 00:04:04,743
Scott: Right.

84
00:04:05,671 --> 00:04:06,277
Scott: And the U.S.

85
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:15,820
Scott: Open is being played in Torrey Pines in San Diego, which is pretty much down the street from, you know, Navy golf, which is where Tiger Woods played with his dad when he was a kid.

86
00:04:16,382 --> 00:04:18,160
Scott: And the tournament was on Father's Day weekend.

87
00:04:18,762 --> 00:04:19,046
Scott: Right.

88
00:04:19,087 --> 00:04:20,200
Scott: So you see where this is going.

89
00:04:21,341 --> 00:04:23,138
Scott: And Tigers is playing with a hurt knee.

90
00:04:24,001 --> 00:04:27,980
Scott: So he plays through four days and he's actually doing pretty badly.

91
00:04:28,264 --> 00:04:32,220
Scott: And at the end of the fourth day, he's tied with this other guy named Rocco Mediate.

92
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,799
Scott: And Rocco is actually a pretty cool dude.

93
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:36,390
Scott: He's not like an asshole or anything.

94
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,860
Scott: He's he's a really fun kind of guy.

95
00:04:38,441 --> 00:04:39,711
Scott: He's like 45 years old.

96
00:04:39,731 --> 00:04:40,719
Scott: What do you base that on?

97
00:04:41,403 --> 00:04:41,838
Scott: What do you mean?

98
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,339
Rym: Is that just like the media telling he's a good guy?

99
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,200
Scott: Well, no, you watch him play and you can see he's sort of having fun.

100
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:53,960
Scott: I see by his golf technique that he must be a good not his technique, but his demeanor when he's hanging out his putter.

101
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:54,778
Rym: Look at the way he holds his.

102
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,699
Scott: You can tell if you want to hate his mom.

103
00:04:56,881 --> 00:04:58,900
Scott: If you watch golf, you're making this take too long.

104
00:05:00,382 --> 00:05:09,060
Scott: If you watch golf, you can see how the you know, the the attitudes and the the emotions of the players as they walk around and, you know, stand there and whatnot, you can see what kind of people they are like.

105
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,840
Scott: You know that John Daly is just like a drunken bum, but, you know, whatever.

106
00:05:12,262 --> 00:05:13,560
Scott: And Rory Savatini is an asshole.

107
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:17,297
Rym: Anyway, you already know more names of golfers than I've ever known.

108
00:05:17,318 --> 00:05:17,740
Rym: Right.

109
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,095
Scott: You don't know Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods.

110
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:21,497
Scott: That's it.

111
00:05:21,577 --> 00:05:27,320
Scott: OK, so so you have Tiger Woods, the greatest golfer to ever live, pretty much right.

112
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,260
Scott: And he's tied on the fourth day of the tournament.

113
00:05:30,361 --> 00:05:31,267
Scott: So the U.S.

114
00:05:31,388 --> 00:05:40,660
Scott: Open, unlike any other golf tournament, or at least most other golf tournaments, and they usually if you are you're tied on a golf tournament, they'll just make you play the 18th hole again.

115
00:05:40,781 --> 00:05:43,115
Scott: And whoever you know, if you win, you win.

116
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:43,940
Scott: And if you lose, you lose.

117
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,337
Scott: And if you tie, you do a different hole until someone wins.

118
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:46,639
Scott: Right.

119
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,082
Scott: The U.S.

120
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:52,524
Scott: Open, if you tie, it makes you play another 18 holes on Monday.

121
00:05:52,605 --> 00:05:56,297
Scott: Now, of course, no one can watch on Monday except the old people, because everyone's at work.

122
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:03,578
Scott: Smart, smart golf puts the golf on the Internet streaming live video for free.

123
00:06:04,681 --> 00:06:07,119
Scott: Other sports take heed.

124
00:06:07,702 --> 00:06:10,379
Rym: That is, in fact, how we were watching it at work.

125
00:06:10,821 --> 00:06:13,135
Scott: I mean, if that wasn't like that, who would have watched?

126
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:14,000
Scott: Nobody.

127
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,760
Scott: Now, you might say, whoa, how are the broadcasters making money off of this?

128
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,680
Scott: Well, they have to work that out.

129
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,345
Scott: But you know what?

130
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:22,200
Scott: Someone was making money off this.

131
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,840
Scott: You know who is very, very happy about this streaming live video of golf?

132
00:06:26,402 --> 00:06:32,859
Scott: Well, first of all, golf was very happy, as I could tell by the comments under the video, it was creating new golf fans.

133
00:06:33,642 --> 00:06:37,920
Scott: And to notice that Tiger Woods is wearing like Nike stuff all the time.

134
00:06:38,161 --> 00:06:40,620
Scott: Notice how the other guy was wearing like Callaway stuff.

135
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,075
Scott: I think it's a living ad.

136
00:06:43,598 --> 00:06:43,839
Scott: Yes.

137
00:06:44,401 --> 00:06:52,140
Scott: Those people, the sponsors and the the endorsers of the players would be very happy if if sports are streaming video on the Internet.

138
00:06:52,801 --> 00:07:05,660
Scott: If I was an endorser advertiser type person, what I would do is instead of buying TV ads or something like that, I would pay to get my, you know, like my ad on like the football field or the ice hockey rink.

139
00:07:06,163 --> 00:07:20,979
Scott: And then I would pay the broadcaster and I would say, you were putting this on the Internet for free so people can see my ad that's on the ice hockey ring and other sports need to take a lesson here because whatever sports do, this more are going to become more popular than the others.

140
00:07:22,301 --> 00:07:22,623
Rym: All right.

141
00:07:23,005 --> 00:07:31,880
Rym: I could I guess I could talk about how I went to buy a new mountain bike, but I think we should get to the news, the big news, the news that everyone's been.

142
00:07:32,181 --> 00:07:34,677
Rym: It's a little passé now, which is good because that's good.

143
00:07:34,818 --> 00:07:35,079
Rym: Yeah.

144
00:07:35,601 --> 00:07:38,840
Scott: So we can't avoid talking about to iPhone news, can we?

145
00:07:39,301 --> 00:07:39,947
Rym: I might get one.

146
00:07:40,632 --> 00:07:41,540
Scott: I'm definitely going to get one.

147
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,500
Scott: There's no question about it.

148
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,700
Rym: It's about there's a 75 percent chance that I will get one.

149
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:46,840
Scott: There's 100 percent chance.

150
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,720
Scott: And I'm going to tell you why.

151
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,080
Scott: The iPhone, the new iPhone is by no means perfect.

152
00:07:52,584 --> 00:07:54,200
Scott: It has its flaws for one.

153
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:55,340
Scott: It has many flaws.

154
00:07:55,820 --> 00:08:00,619
Rym: Get podcasts by any usual or nice means.

155
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,179
Scott: Yes, that is a major flaw.

156
00:08:02,621 --> 00:08:03,808
Scott: There are other major flaws.

157
00:08:03,848 --> 00:08:04,914
Scott: It is very closed.

158
00:08:05,156 --> 00:08:05,920
Scott: That is a problem.

159
00:08:06,001 --> 00:08:07,359
Scott: I can't just do whatever I want with it.

160
00:08:07,842 --> 00:08:10,480
Scott: I can't just like be making Skype calls on it yet.

161
00:08:10,722 --> 00:08:11,507
Scott: At least that's not.

162
00:08:11,548 --> 00:08:13,119
Scott: that's not you know, other phones can do that.

163
00:08:13,943 --> 00:08:15,677
Scott: You know, there are many problems with it.

164
00:08:16,445 --> 00:08:17,620
Scott: It is by no means perfect.

165
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:25,476
Scott: However, if you compare it to every other phone in existence, it is available the entire world, actually, I would say.

166
00:08:25,496 --> 00:08:26,220
Scott: Right.

167
00:08:27,662 --> 00:08:29,500
Scott: It is superior for these reasons.

168
00:08:29,922 --> 00:08:31,299
Scott: Let's compare it to that.

169
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,700
Rym: That's a lot like the democracy is the worst possible form of government.

170
00:08:34,922 --> 00:08:37,500
Rym: after every possible form we've already tried precisely.

171
00:08:37,682 --> 00:08:42,178
Scott: Let's take a look at a good competitor, the Nokia and ninety five ninety seven, whatever it is.

172
00:08:42,259 --> 00:08:42,440
Scott: Right.

173
00:08:42,561 --> 00:08:42,804
Scott: Yeah.

174
00:08:42,905 --> 00:08:44,120
Scott: The phone that does everything.

175
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,160
Scott: The problem is the iPhone has a Web browser.

176
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,380
Scott: The Nokia and ninety five has a Web browser.

177
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,980
Scott: The Nokia and ninety five Web browser is usable.

178
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,300
Scott: The know the Apple Web browser is far superior.

179
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,555
Scott: It's actually a pleasure to use.

180
00:08:59,575 --> 00:09:00,240
Scott: Right.

181
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,675
Scott: The Nokia and ninety five can play some MP3s.

182
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,046
Scott: It sure can.

183
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:05,259
Scott: It can also play some videos.

184
00:09:05,744 --> 00:09:07,459
Rym: Yeah, I phone as I do.

185
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,799
Scott: It is an amazing music and video player.

186
00:09:11,161 --> 00:09:14,197
Scott: And at top of the line, it is as good as a standalone MP3 player.

187
00:09:15,162 --> 00:09:17,420
Scott: In fact, better than that, because it's also the phone.

188
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:21,515
Scott: And if the phone rings, it's very clever with how it will, you know, pause the music and all that.

189
00:09:21,938 --> 00:09:22,100
Scott: Right.

190
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,219
Scott: Those sorts of as the visual voicemail.

191
00:09:25,522 --> 00:09:27,660
Scott: Now, there are not many other people have that going on.

192
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:31,560
Scott: But if you get a voicemail, you can just look at the text instead of having to see the dial and then listen.

193
00:09:31,963 --> 00:09:32,691
Scott: That is a pleasure.

194
00:09:32,712 --> 00:09:33,380
Scott: Right.

195
00:09:33,983 --> 00:09:36,980
Scott: When you make text messages, it does the the threading like an I.M.

196
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,829
Scott: conversation.

197
00:09:37,849 --> 00:09:38,600
Scott: Right.

198
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:42,900
Scott: It is also a GPS, a high quality GPS.

199
00:09:43,281 --> 00:09:45,239
Rym: So a lot of people were confused about this.

200
00:09:45,641 --> 00:09:51,335
Rym: It's not the cell phone GPS that most cell phones have where they triangulate with cell towers, assisted GPS.

201
00:09:51,678 --> 00:09:51,900
Rym: Yes.

202
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,578
Scott: Which is better than regular GPS.

203
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:57,319
Scott: It is like the best GPS you can get is a consumer pretty much.

204
00:09:58,081 --> 00:10:02,640
Scott: So basically, for the price of less than the Nokia, whatever.

205
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:03,243
Scott: Right.

206
00:10:03,323 --> 00:10:08,678
Scott: You're getting something that might be lacking a few features that the Nokia device has.

207
00:10:09,361 --> 00:10:15,860
Scott: But the features it does have are actually usable, whereas in the Nokia and the other phones are less usable to the point.

208
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,758
Scott: I mean, in your Blackberry, it has a Web browser.

209
00:10:17,778 --> 00:10:17,940
Scott: Right.

210
00:10:18,321 --> 00:10:20,437
Scott: But you wouldn't actually be Web browsing with that shit.

211
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:20,799
Rym: I do.

212
00:10:21,302 --> 00:10:22,274
Rym: But the thing is painful.

213
00:10:22,476 --> 00:10:22,760
Rym: Oh, yeah.

214
00:10:22,821 --> 00:10:24,700
Rym: That's why the only side I go to is Google Reader.

215
00:10:25,002 --> 00:10:26,074
Rym: And even then, it sucks.

216
00:10:26,337 --> 00:10:26,560
Scott: Right.

217
00:10:26,961 --> 00:10:29,900
Scott: But here on the iPhone, it has less features.

218
00:10:30,021 --> 00:10:32,040
Scott: But the features it has are actually usable.

219
00:10:32,261 --> 00:10:33,608
Scott: And this is why the thing is.

220
00:10:33,668 --> 00:10:40,820
Scott: the same thing is true for Mac OS X. Mac OS X is less features than Linux or Windows, but they're more usable.

221
00:10:41,322 --> 00:10:46,913
Scott: And that's a bad thing because on a PC, on a big honking machine, I want 100 percent features.

222
00:10:46,953 --> 00:10:47,940
Scott: I want to be able to do anything.

223
00:10:48,121 --> 00:10:48,241
Scott: But

224
00:10:48,301 --> 00:10:57,954
Rym: on a portable device, especially with a small interface like that, I want to be able to do the few things I need to do as best as I can do them as quickly as possible,

225
00:10:57,974 --> 00:11:07,460
Scott: because even on a PC where Windows or Linux are less usable than Mac, you know, I guess theoretically, they're still usable on the phones.

226
00:11:07,862 --> 00:11:10,580
Scott: The unusable interfaces are unusable.

227
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:16,720
Scott: They are painful to use, you know, even where Windows or Linux suffers compared to OS X in terms of interface.

228
00:11:16,982 --> 00:11:18,072
Scott: They're not impossible.

229
00:11:18,092 --> 00:11:18,880
Scott: They're not painful.

230
00:11:19,021 --> 00:11:20,499
Scott: They're just a little less slick.

231
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:29,360
Scott: The iPhone is a pleasure where the other phones are, I guess, I don't know, torture to try to get those features to happen.

232
00:11:30,082 --> 00:11:30,364
Scott: All right.

233
00:11:30,425 --> 00:11:34,840
Scott: So that is why I will get the iPhone, because for I can replace my phone, which sucks.

234
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,898
Scott: I can replace my iPod, which I guess is OK.

235
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,180
Scott: I'll be replacing it with a similar, better iPod.

236
00:11:40,962 --> 00:11:47,179
Scott: And I won't have to go and buy one of those Tom Tom or one of those other company geo, you know, GPS thingies.

237
00:11:48,424 --> 00:11:49,920
Scott: And I can get that all in one thing.

238
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:56,540
Scott: I can carry less things around with me, which is a huge thing that the other phones don't have going for them.

239
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,300
Scott: I can because like I bought the Nokia or something.

240
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,660
Scott: I still have to have my iPod because it's not a good video audio player.

241
00:12:02,062 --> 00:12:02,343
Scott: All right.

242
00:12:03,448 --> 00:12:05,799
Scott: And I'll need to carry one thing.

243
00:12:06,362 --> 00:12:06,806
Scott: It'll be great.

244
00:12:06,846 --> 00:12:10,819
Scott: I'll have three things in one, three things, which would have had to carry separately before.

245
00:12:11,402 --> 00:12:12,389
Rym: And I mean, of course, 3G.

246
00:12:12,973 --> 00:12:13,054
Rym: Yeah.

247
00:12:14,422 --> 00:12:16,080
Scott: It's that's as fast as it goes.

248
00:12:16,561 --> 00:12:24,439
Rym: And granted, do be aware all of you out there that 3G will subs if you're using it, will substantially cut your battery life.

249
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:24,922
Scott: Yeah.

250
00:12:24,982 --> 00:12:28,100
Scott: But the point of 3G is that there is no Wi-Fi here.

251
00:12:28,462 --> 00:12:31,520
Scott: I want to still be able to browse the web and I don't want to be painful.

252
00:12:31,881 --> 00:12:43,340
Scott: But the 2G iPhone browsing the web and some such when there are no Wi-Fi access was painful, ludicrously painful because 2G, you know, wireless service is pretty much good for making phone calls.

253
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:43,741
Scott: Not much.

254
00:12:43,761 --> 00:12:45,692
Rym: Just just so people are aware of the.

255
00:12:46,315 --> 00:12:51,162
Rym: these are the stats as they have released them, which means that obviously the real world load is much less.

256
00:12:51,985 --> 00:12:56,520
Rym: Ten hours of 2G talking, five hours of 3G talking.

257
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,859
Scott: That's still, you know, considering the fact that this is also going to be an MP3 video player and a GPS.

258
00:13:03,121 --> 00:13:03,343
Scott: Yeah.

259
00:13:03,586 --> 00:13:04,879
Scott: I'm going to be charging in my car.

260
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,149
Scott: I'll be charging it at work.

261
00:13:06,169 --> 00:13:07,179
Scott: I'll be charging it at home.

262
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,669
Scott: I'll probably have it like I'll.

263
00:13:08,689 --> 00:13:11,407
Scott: probably I'm actually getting the docks instead of just the cables.

264
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:15,959
Scott: that way, like at work, it can stand up and I can sort of poke at it while it's just standing there.

265
00:13:16,381 --> 00:13:19,300
Scott: Maybe I can use it as like my clock radio at home, you know, wake up.

266
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:19,963
Scott: And there it is.

267
00:13:20,064 --> 00:13:22,819
Rym: I'd probably have a dock at home and just a cable at work.

268
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:23,487
Scott: I don't know.

269
00:13:23,548 --> 00:13:24,218
Scott: We'll see what I do.

270
00:13:25,102 --> 00:13:26,818
Scott: We'll see what the prices on those things are.

271
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:27,682
Scott: Yeah.

272
00:13:27,703 --> 00:13:31,608
Scott: I mean, the dock is really just a little plastic thing for the cable to go into.

273
00:13:31,729 --> 00:13:33,099
Scott: You know, it's not special in any way.

274
00:13:33,682 --> 00:13:34,473
Rym: Yeah, it depends.

275
00:13:34,757 --> 00:13:34,858
Rym: Yeah.

276
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:35,622
Scott: Yeah.

277
00:13:35,642 --> 00:13:37,699
Scott: At work, it'll probably just be charging, but at home it'll be.

278
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:43,199
Rym: But the point I was getting to, you know, five hours of 3G, six hours of Wi-Fi.

279
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:44,942
Scott: Yeah.

280
00:13:45,043 --> 00:13:53,094
Scott: Remember, when you want to use those things, you have a radio in there and you to turn this radio on with a large amount of energy to power that antenna and send out a radio signal.

281
00:13:53,115 --> 00:13:59,928
Rym: like my laptop or any good laptop usually has a hard kill all the wireless switch, which is one for the.

282
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,020
Rym: you know, you're on a plane.

283
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,679
Rym: You can just kill all the wireless and be safe.

284
00:14:03,262 --> 00:14:05,699
Rym: But we'll say from getting screwed by the airline if they find you.

285
00:14:06,482 --> 00:14:09,616
Rym: But do it'll save a couple hours on your battery.

286
00:14:09,636 --> 00:14:09,717
Rym: Yeah.

287
00:14:10,921 --> 00:14:18,666
Scott: I mean, that's really, you know, the iPhone, as far as I know, is actually very smart about turning on and off the different parts of itself when it needs them.

288
00:14:18,686 --> 00:14:20,159
Scott: I mean, from what I've heard, the GPS.

289
00:14:20,962 --> 00:14:21,224
Scott: Right.

290
00:14:21,264 --> 00:14:22,980
Scott: Will only turn on for like a little bit.

291
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,240
Scott: Get the coordinates and turn off.

292
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,460
Scott: It won't have a staying on sustained GPS because that would kill the battery like in 30 minutes, probably.

293
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:36,120
Rym: But then again, I'm sure certain applications like say you had it docked to something in your car with some sort of navigation thing.

294
00:14:36,602 --> 00:14:37,292
Rym: Then you don't care.

295
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:37,800
Rym: It's being powered.

296
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:38,603
Scott: Exactly.

297
00:14:38,966 --> 00:14:45,360
Scott: Another thing is that they've been taught they're talking about if you want to make a service that pushes right to the phone.

298
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:57,020
Scott: The thing is, if they just let people program that on their own, that would sort of they could kill the battery on the phone very easily if the phone is pulling a server somewhere or depending on the architecture of it.

299
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,204
Scott: Right.

300
00:14:58,224 --> 00:15:02,909
Scott: So Apple made this thing that people are sort of, you know, two ways about.

301
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:12,160
Scott: and there are two ways about it, where if you want to make an application that pushes data to the phones, you actually push your server's data to this Apple server.

302
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:19,580
Scott: And then the Apple server manages the pushing to the phones, which on the one hand, you know, sort of goes more towards that.

303
00:15:19,923 --> 00:15:21,280
Scott: They've closed the platform.

304
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:29,340
Scott: They're limiting what developers can do and such and whatnot, which is, you know, not so great, but it's going to save you a lot of battery life.

305
00:15:29,722 --> 00:15:39,900
Scott: And it'll actually be, I think, easier for people to develop applications that push to the phones rather than before, where, you know, they would have had to develop it on their own and they might conflict with people.

306
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:45,740
Scott: And I think it will make a smoother experience despite being yet another lacking of features and possibilities.

307
00:15:46,021 --> 00:15:47,419
Rym: So I assume you're going to get the eight gig.

308
00:15:48,103 --> 00:15:48,426
Scott: I don't know.

309
00:15:48,487 --> 00:15:50,604
Scott: I might get the 16.

310
00:15:50,604 --> 00:15:51,455
Scott: I got to think about it.

311
00:15:51,557 --> 00:15:51,780
Scott: Really?

312
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,497
Scott: I am not sure.

313
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,316
Rym: I know a lot of people were complaining about the fact that there was no 32 gig.

314
00:15:56,303 --> 00:15:56,932
Scott: I don't need 32 gigs.

315
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,084
Scott: I mean, I have.

316
00:15:58,105 --> 00:16:04,000
Rym: I can understand why they would complain, because I can conceive of a lot of lifestyles where I would need that.

317
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:07,200
Rym: But I use a two gig nano right now.

318
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:07,481
Scott: Yeah.

319
00:16:07,501 --> 00:16:14,300
Scott: The reason I have a four gig nano and the reason I'm thinking about the 16 right is because only one hundred dollars more, which is not too bad.

320
00:16:14,502 --> 00:16:14,725
Scott: Right.

321
00:16:15,231 --> 00:16:15,839
Scott: I can afford it.

322
00:16:16,361 --> 00:16:20,799
Scott: But in addition to the probably I'll be probably putting a lot more musics on it.

323
00:16:21,101 --> 00:16:23,420
Scott: Because it'll be like my primary device and whatnot.

324
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:25,420
Scott: And I'm starting to organize my music and iTunes.

325
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,098
Scott: I'm already, you know, using more music on my iPod as it is.

326
00:16:28,742 --> 00:16:30,620
Scott: But I'm going to be installing apps and things.

327
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,579
Scott: And who knows how much space they're going to take up.

328
00:16:32,801 --> 00:16:36,140
Scott: So rather than wait around, I want to get the most for my money.

329
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:39,844
Scott: I mean, it'll cost the same amount of money to get this thing around holidays as well now.

330
00:16:40,186 --> 00:16:44,578
Scott: So buying it earlier just means I'll get more for my money in terms of all those months of being able to use it.

331
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,063
Scott: Yeah.

332
00:16:45,103 --> 00:16:46,580
Scott: So I can't wait for a bigger one.

333
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,339
Scott: So it might be a good idea to get the big one from the get go.

334
00:16:49,661 --> 00:16:49,883
Scott: Yeah.

335
00:16:49,983 --> 00:17:00,099
Rym: I mean, the only reason I'm waiting, I'm probably going to get one, but I'm waiting a little bit, partly because the main reason I want to go with this is because it has kind of the Blackberry push and all that.

336
00:17:00,904 --> 00:17:07,020
Rym: And my work, we're going to try to set that up and we've got to make sure that it's good enough to where I can drop my Blackberry.

337
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:12,980
Rym: Yeah, because if I don't need my Blackberry anymore, I'm all about having just an iPhone to carry.

338
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:13,320
Rym: Yeah.

339
00:17:13,361 --> 00:17:16,234
Scott: Not not having to carry more than one device is quite amazing.

340
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:25,637
Rym: Of course, there's one benefit of having my current setup where I have the Blackberry and the crappy older in the Blackberry off and escape work.

341
00:17:26,141 --> 00:17:26,785
Rym: No, because I could.

342
00:17:26,805 --> 00:17:31,420
Rym: I could probably just not turn off notifications from the work stuff when I'm on vacation.

343
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:36,920
Rym: I imagine the trouble is I do a lot of sports like mountain biking today.

344
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:40,094
Rym: I was out biking in the pouring rain for like 45 minutes.

345
00:17:40,114 --> 00:17:40,717
Rym: All right.

346
00:17:41,721 --> 00:17:43,618
Rym: I bring my crappy cell phone with me.

347
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,800
Rym: Oftentimes I'll wipe out and that cell phone is in a lot of danger.

348
00:17:48,382 --> 00:17:50,640
Scott: Well, you can get a little protective thingy for the iPhone.

349
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,560
Scott: Keep it, you know, like a little armband thingy or something like that.

350
00:17:53,741 --> 00:17:58,800
Rym: It's not so great because the shocks alone, especially I mean, it would have to be a pretty sturdy piece of equipment.

351
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:05,500
Scott: I mean, as long as you don't scratch, as long as it doesn't hit the pavement and get scratched up, if you just shake it around, it's it's all solid state.

352
00:18:05,582 --> 00:18:06,300
Scott: So it's not going to hurt.

353
00:18:06,581 --> 00:18:07,506
Rym: But my phone is.

354
00:18:07,788 --> 00:18:13,060
Rym: there have been many times where I've landed against a tree or something and pretty much straight on my cell phone.

355
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,917
Scott: Well, I mean, but it was in your pocket, right?

356
00:18:14,998 --> 00:18:15,179
Scott: Yeah.

357
00:18:15,441 --> 00:18:17,560
Scott: See, I'm thinking someone should make something right.

358
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:21,227
Scott: That would be like maybe a little metal like sealed container, sort of.

359
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,099
Scott: that were like a strap.

360
00:18:22,582 --> 00:18:25,458
Scott: So like, you know, if you're doing something heavy duty, you can bring it with you.

361
00:18:25,882 --> 00:18:37,119
Scott: Yeah, I'll have to find something like that, like a plant, like a plastic shell, not just the kind that covers all of it, but the screen, but like a complete plastic shell that locks shut, you know, but is still has little tiny holes in it.

362
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:44,459
Scott: So like, you know, maybe it still wouldn't be waterproof, but you could hear it if it rings, you know, and you would just sort of be if you landed on it.

363
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,340
Rym: I'd rather have straight up sealed, waterproof, pneumatic.

364
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,377
Scott: Just so you get that, too.

365
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:49,690
Scott: And you wouldn't hear it ringing.

366
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:50,560
Rym: I don't care about that.

367
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,471
Rym: I only care the phone in case one.

368
00:18:52,491 --> 00:18:53,779
Rym: I want to see what time it is.

369
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,640
Scott: Or you need to call an emergency.

370
00:18:55,881 --> 00:18:56,203
Scott: Yes.

371
00:18:56,544 --> 00:19:01,370
Rym: Or usually an emergency for me is I ran too far and I can't get home before dinner.

372
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,719
Rym: Will someone come pick me up?

373
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,360
Rym: I'm somewhere in New Paul.

374
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,696
Scott: See, the only thing the the only reason I was before hearing all the news of the new iPhone.

375
00:19:09,736 --> 00:19:09,940
Scott: Right.

376
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,600
Scott: I was torn between the iPhone or waiting for the Android phones.

377
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,758
Scott: And the thing is, I'm a heavy user of the Google ads for domains.

378
00:19:18,099 --> 00:19:18,260
Scott: Right.

379
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,540
Scott: Google is my thing for communications.

380
00:19:20,681 --> 00:19:22,839
Scott: And the fact that they're doing this mobile me.

381
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:29,540
Scott: Well, first of all, if I wasn't using Google ads for domains and the mobile me thing was free, I would have gone for it right away.

382
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:32,538
Scott: But I'm not going to go for Google ads for domains is where it is.

383
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,516
Scott: Screw mobile me.

384
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,138
Scott: It's not worth the money, even if I didn't have Google apps.

385
00:19:36,178 --> 00:19:36,380
Scott: Right.

386
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:49,680
Scott: So the reason the Android phone was appealing, obviously, is because it would have had better integration with my Google apps and my Gmail's and my Google calendar and all that business, where the iPhone does integrate with that, but only on a mediocre level.

387
00:19:49,881 --> 00:19:53,080
Scott: You know, it does basically the bare minimum integrating with the Google stuff.

388
00:19:53,843 --> 00:19:55,800
Scott: And that's sort of sad and disappointing.

389
00:19:57,141 --> 00:20:05,500
Scott: But the Google phone, even the Android, as good as it might have been or might as well, as good as it will be, because from everything I've seen, it is pretty awesome.

390
00:20:06,481 --> 00:20:09,080
Scott: There's no way that that is a good enough MP3 player.

391
00:20:09,261 --> 00:20:11,180
Scott: There's no way it's a good enough video player.

392
00:20:11,321 --> 00:20:12,818
Scott: There's no way it's a good enough GPS.

393
00:20:13,722 --> 00:20:16,400
Scott: I would have to have that and have other stuff.

394
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:17,839
Scott: I would have to have an iPod still.

395
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:36,900
Scott: I would end having fewer devices worth, you know, if if you tell me I have a choice, since there is no perfect thing option out there, if I have to choose between my Google interfacing is slightly mediocre or I have to carry a bunch of things instead of one thing, I'm going to carry the one thing and have a mediocre Google.

396
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:42,720
Rym: I don't trust Google to fully support my four domains because they don't support it for credit is to Google.

397
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,580
Scott: If people Google apps for domains, I don't know if people know about this.

398
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,699
Scott: We use it heavily is if you get a Gmail account rights at gmail dot com.

399
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:50,940
Scott: Right.

400
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:56,220
Scott: But let's say you don't really want to run a Web server because Web servers suck and it sucks to run them.

401
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,780
Scott: But you want to be a people to email you at your own domain dot com.

402
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,298
Scott: So for us, it's from recruit dot com.

403
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,480
Scott: But we don't want to run the mail server.

404
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,759
Scott: Well, Google run the mail server for you.

405
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:09,500
Scott: And it just looks like Gmail.

406
00:21:09,641 --> 00:21:11,780
Scott: It is Gmail, but it's your domain.

407
00:21:11,881 --> 00:21:16,660
Scott: So when you email us, we actually go to like Gmail and read those emails.

408
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,100
Scott: But it's not a Gmail account.

409
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,780
Scott: It's a front row crew dot com Google apps for domains account.

410
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,099
Scott: The thing is, they don't support.

411
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:31,340
Scott: It's like the people who use Google apps or domains, the hardcore Google users who actually run their own domain off of Google, we get the shaft.

412
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,059
Scott: We get less.

413
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,739
Scott: We don't have those Google Labs features that are in Gmail.

414
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,620
Rym: Not even that, like Google Reader.

415
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,520
Rym: I have the Google stuff doesn't work at all.

416
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:42,400
Rym: So I have a Gmail account and a Google Apps account.

417
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,940
Rym: Yeah, email account exists solely to use all the Google stuff.

418
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,180
Scott: The people with Google Apps or domains get the shaft.

419
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:57,960
Scott: So because of that, I can't trust, you know, without super confirmation that the Android phone isn't also going to shaft people who use Google Apps or domains as opposed to just regular Gmail.

420
00:21:58,121 --> 00:21:59,399
Scott: So screw Google.

421
00:21:59,762 --> 00:22:01,819
Scott: I'm still going to use Google Apps or domains is still the best.

422
00:22:02,341 --> 00:22:10,820
Scott: But I'm going to just work through it with the shitty interface that I can, you know, going to the Web page in the Web browser, syncing with the icon, the calendar thing.

423
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:14,100
Rym: Well, I think my strategy for now is I'm not going to get the iPhone right away.

424
00:22:14,362 --> 00:22:16,078
Rym: I'll let Scott get it and a few other people get it.

425
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,940
Rym: And by then, I'll probably know how well it's going to work with my work.

426
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,140
Scott: Well, I mean, I got my brother got an iPod touch and I was poking that.

427
00:22:23,402 --> 00:22:23,745
Scott: And I was.

428
00:22:23,886 --> 00:22:25,380
Scott: all I had to do is poke it for five minutes.

429
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,695
Scott: And I was like, yeah, all right, I'll get the iPhone.

430
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:28,520
Scott: Yeah.

431
00:22:29,362 --> 00:22:31,759
Rym: It really just comes down to if I can support it with my work.

432
00:22:31,921 --> 00:22:33,940
Rym: Because if I still have to carry that Blackberry, I'm not.

433
00:22:34,381 --> 00:22:34,684
Scott: It's not.

434
00:22:34,865 --> 00:22:36,320
Scott: if I still have to carry the Blackberry, I wouldn't.

435
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,900
Scott: If it didn't replace it, I wouldn't do it either.

436
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:50,240
Scott: The only other thing I can say about the iPhone is that as good as the multi touch is, these keyboard is not better than actual QWERTY button keyboard, which is why my boss refuses to get an iPhone.

437
00:22:51,561 --> 00:22:56,620
Scott: But, you know, that's another tiny sacrifice I will make because the advantages are far away.

438
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,820
Rym: Plus, I'll point out I've seen this kind of often on the train.

439
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:07,053
Rym: I'll see a person with a Blackberry or something and plugged into it will be a full size keyboard.

440
00:23:07,274 --> 00:23:07,816
Scott: Wow.

441
00:23:08,017 --> 00:23:08,518
Scott: Yeah.

442
00:23:08,538 --> 00:23:08,960
Scott: Scary.

443
00:23:09,522 --> 00:23:15,019
Rym: I mean, it could because if you're just typing emails, I guess it would kind of for a little email.

444
00:23:15,341 --> 00:23:21,340
Scott: OK, but for a big email, you're much better off taking your laptop, tethering it to the Blackberry and opening outlook.

445
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:22,863
Rym: Yeah.

446
00:23:22,883 --> 00:23:22,964
Rym: Yeah.

447
00:23:24,077 --> 00:23:24,340
Rym: Anyway.

448
00:23:25,201 --> 00:23:32,920
Rym: So 20 years ago at Michigan State University, a university that has much love for him because it's an awesome college town.

449
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,758
Scott: You didn't go there, though.

450
00:23:33,981 --> 00:23:37,238
Rym: No, but I had a lot of friends there because you're from Michigan and my brother went there.

451
00:23:37,601 --> 00:23:39,191
Rym: And let me tell you, there was no way.

452
00:23:39,312 --> 00:23:43,460
Scott: it says Michigan State, not U of M, not U of M, Michigan State, Michigan State.

453
00:23:43,621 --> 00:23:43,884
Scott: All right.

454
00:23:44,146 --> 00:23:45,479
Rym: The green one with the Spartans.

455
00:23:46,282 --> 00:23:47,620
Scott: OK, I didn't actually know it was green.

456
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,002
Scott: All right.

457
00:23:48,122 --> 00:23:50,295
Rym: Green and white in Lansing, the capital.

458
00:23:50,316 --> 00:23:50,919
Scott: All righty.

459
00:23:51,240 --> 00:24:05,500
Rym: Anyway, so 20 years ago, a man by the name of Richard Linsky, a biologist and evolutionary biologist, took a strain of E. coli and he split it up and made 12 E. coli populations.

460
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:10,020
Rym: And for the last 20 years, he's been observing these 12 strains.

461
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,168
Scott: 20 years.

462
00:24:11,431 --> 00:24:11,816
Scott: Yes.

463
00:24:11,897 --> 00:24:12,140
Scott: Wow.

464
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,780
Scott: That's quite a large experiment.

465
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,214
Rym: They've undergone over 40,000 generations.

466
00:24:18,341 --> 00:24:21,340
Scott: That is quite the experiment of grandiose-ness.

467
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:21,661
Scott: Well,

468
00:24:21,983 --> 00:24:23,411
Rym: in this time, I'm not going to get

469
00:24:23,471 --> 00:24:26,725
Scott: I mean, I'm no scientist, but I would be I

470
00:24:27,046 --> 00:24:29,236
Rym: even wore a lab coat and I would be

471
00:24:29,297 --> 00:24:34,200
Scott: mighty bored if the if I like if I only worked on one software project for 20 years,

472
00:24:34,341 --> 00:24:34,786
Rym: I imagine

473
00:24:34,827 --> 00:24:35,979
Scott: I would be mighty bored.

474
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,900
Rym: I imagine he worked on other things.

475
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,059
Scott: I hope so, because God damn, that'd be so boring.

476
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,220
Scott: Well, one thing for 20 years, day 4008.

477
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:45,927
Rym: No change.

478
00:24:46,675 --> 00:24:47,099
Scott: Good God.

479
00:24:48,401 --> 00:24:53,320
Rym: So I'm not going to get into all of the details, partly because I want to talk about a lot of other news tonight.

480
00:24:53,521 --> 00:25:04,999
Rym: And two, because Pete and Lisa and Scott Johnson will probably pick holes through anything I say beyond the kind of AP wire story we don't know we're talking about.

481
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,238
Rym: I know a little bit.

482
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:10,040
Scott: We know the more than most people, but not as much as people really know.

483
00:25:10,665 --> 00:25:11,580
Rym: So here's the deal.

484
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:16,780
Rym: I'm going to first I'm going to paraphrase from this article, and then I'm going to summarize the article.

485
00:25:17,521 --> 00:25:25,180
Rym: But sometime around the thirty one thousand five hundredth generation, something dramatic happened in just one of the populations.

486
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:34,040
Rym: The bacteria suddenly acquired the ability to metabolize citrate, a second nutrient in their culture that E. coli cannot normally use.

487
00:25:34,441 --> 00:25:37,280
Scott: As in you squirt some oranges on it and it goes yummy, yummy, yummy.

488
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,640
Scott: Well, the other E. coli is good.

489
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,359
Rym: No, it was something that was already there.

490
00:25:40,601 --> 00:25:41,748
Rym: OK, basically.

491
00:25:41,789 --> 00:25:43,580
Rym: Now, this is why this is amazing.

492
00:25:43,921 --> 00:25:53,680
Rym: The ability to metabolize citrate in this manner is one of these specific traits that is used by bacteriologists to distinguish E. coli from other bacteria.

493
00:25:53,981 --> 00:25:58,799
Scott: So in other words, if you want to do a test to find E. coli, you put some citrates in there.

494
00:25:59,242 --> 00:26:02,820
Scott: And if the citrates are not metabolized, then it's E. coli.

495
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:07,040
Scott: But if the citrates are metabolized, then then it may be a different species.

496
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:07,622
Scott: All righty.

497
00:26:08,143 --> 00:26:18,400
Rym: But apparently that basically the gist of this is that these bacteria evolved a very complex and very specialized trait.

498
00:26:19,004 --> 00:26:20,760
Rym: And we observe this directly.

499
00:26:21,362 --> 00:26:25,240
Rym: Now, I don't think I need to preach to the choir here, but there has.

500
00:26:25,904 --> 00:26:28,060
Rym: there has been a lot of evidence for evolution.

501
00:26:28,526 --> 00:26:29,520
Rym: The theory of evolution.

502
00:26:29,801 --> 00:26:31,979
Rym: There's really never been evidence against it.

503
00:26:32,742 --> 00:26:37,519
Rym: This is I don't know how many nails there are in the coffin, but this is the biggest fucking nail I've ever seen.

504
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,940
Scott: I mean, we already had some like stakes right through the heart and stuff.

505
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,520
Scott: But this is like I don't know.

506
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:49,938
Scott: This is like the nail of heaven through right down the asshole and out the mouth.

507
00:26:50,461 --> 00:26:55,260
Rym: To paraphrase a quote from Jerry Coyne, another evolutionary biologist.

508
00:26:55,522 --> 00:26:56,360
Rym: He's from Chicago.

509
00:26:57,101 --> 00:27:03,340
Rym: The thing I like most is it says that you can get these complex traits evolving by a combination of unlikely events.

510
00:27:04,002 --> 00:27:06,220
Rym: That's just what the creationists say can happen.

511
00:27:07,181 --> 00:27:07,675
Rym: And you know what?

512
00:27:08,803 --> 00:27:10,396
Rym: We have we watched it.

513
00:27:10,477 --> 00:27:10,840
Rym: It happened.

514
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:15,460
Scott: Here it is on video through a microscope, microscope, video.

515
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,064
Scott: Watch.

516
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:16,655
Scott: See it.

517
00:27:17,784 --> 00:27:19,140
Rym: I just think this is fascinating.

518
00:27:19,261 --> 00:27:25,578
Rym: And I'm hoping that Pete and Lisa and Scott will have something to say in the forums about how amazing this is.

519
00:27:26,121 --> 00:27:26,361
Scott: Oh, yeah.

520
00:27:33,334 --> 00:27:40,360
Rym: So anyway, before we get on with more tech news, round up a cop out Monday, it's not a cop out.

521
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:40,984
Scott: This is good stuff.

522
00:27:41,366 --> 00:27:43,360
Rym: Yeah, there is this time in the past.

523
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,647
Rym: It has definitely been a cop out.

524
00:27:44,707 --> 00:27:47,059
Rym: It's time for things of the day.

525
00:27:47,681 --> 00:27:55,179
Rym: So I don't know how many of you are aware of this practice, but because a bunch of you were fooled in the forum, I have to bring this up.

526
00:27:55,781 --> 00:28:07,699
Rym: There is a pass time on the Internet, a pass time that I love, that I adore, that I wish I had more time to try to get involved in called link baiting or news baiting.

527
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,820
Rym: Now, the idea here is that you make a similar to Rick Rolling.

528
00:28:11,581 --> 00:28:12,143
Rym: Not really.

529
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:16,220
Rym: You make a fake news story and try to get the real news to pick up on it.

530
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,100
Rym: Or the very least happens a lot to fool a bunch of people.

531
00:28:19,525 --> 00:28:20,419
Rym: And there was a story.

532
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:25,100
Rym: Our forum was talking about it, about a teenager who stole his dad's credit card and bought hookers.

533
00:28:25,721 --> 00:28:29,719
Rym: And if you couldn't tell from reading the article, it was totally made up.

534
00:28:30,242 --> 00:28:39,160
Rym: And here is the detailed explanation of who made it up, why they made it up, who paid them to make it up and how you're all too credulous for the Internet.

535
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,408
Scott: Credulity.

536
00:28:41,955 --> 00:28:42,218
Scott: Learn it.

537
00:28:42,983 --> 00:28:44,519
Rym: Well, no, credulity, avoid it.

538
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:48,999
Scott: Same thing you got if you learn about credulity, you won't have it.

539
00:28:49,342 --> 00:28:50,975
Rym: You need to be incredulous.

540
00:28:51,177 --> 00:28:51,519
Scott: Exactly.

541
00:28:52,943 --> 00:28:53,185
Scott: All right.

542
00:28:53,306 --> 00:28:53,629
Scott: We're good.

543
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:54,799
Rym: That's all I got.

544
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,161
Scott: All right.

545
00:28:55,222 --> 00:29:01,100
Scott: So you if you're listening to Tech Monday, you should know about twenty six hundred magazine.

546
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,478
Scott: It started out as sort of like.

547
00:29:04,081 --> 00:29:19,449
Scott: Yeah, OK, it started out as sort of like this sort of zine of sorts, and you had to like go to a news group and send it, you know, self-addressed stamped envelope to get, you know, sort of get it and eventually became, you know, a real quarterly magazine that was professionally published.

548
00:29:19,469 --> 00:29:20,720
Scott: And I think it's dead now.

549
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,504
Scott: Isn't it dead now?

550
00:29:22,329 --> 00:29:23,637
Rym: I stopped reading it in the 90s.

551
00:29:24,521 --> 00:29:27,560
Scott: I never actually read twenty six hundred, but it was always infamous.

552
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:30,180
Scott: It's like everyone knew what it was, whether you read it or not.

553
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,278
Rym: It'll totally tell you how to make a blotto box.

554
00:29:32,741 --> 00:29:34,026
Scott: Yeah, it's basically.

555
00:29:34,207 --> 00:29:38,403
Scott: it's basically the magazine for the hacks or is the real hackers?

556
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:46,580
Scott: like the whole history of, you know, what happened in technology like the 80s and 90s is all in twenty six hundred magazine.

557
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:54,000
Scott: We're talking about everything from the phone freaking guys, you know, to the to what caused the creation of the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

558
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:54,280
Rym: Yes.

559
00:29:54,301 --> 00:30:04,374
Rym: I mean, it's probably common knowledge to a lot of your techies, but knowing the twenty six hundred, the number is a very important number and not just because of the Atari.

560
00:30:04,597 --> 00:30:04,800
Scott: Yep.

561
00:30:05,242 --> 00:30:09,023
Scott: And we're talking like, you know, the whole story of Kevin Mitnick was in there, the whole thing.

562
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:09,304
Scott: Right.

563
00:30:09,927 --> 00:30:13,303
Scott: So I posted this in the forums already, but it's got to be my thing of the day anyway.

564
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:19,464
Scott: They are making a hardcover bound book that is eight hundred and eighty eight pages.

565
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:23,980
Scott: That is the best of twenty six hundred.

566
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:30,871
Scott: So if you didn't have a chance to, you know, live nerd history, you're too young for that shit or you just missed out on it or whatever.

567
00:30:31,894 --> 00:30:33,982
Scott: by this book, you can preorder on Amazon.

568
00:30:34,002 --> 00:30:37,896
Scott: It's only like twenty six dollars and you'll basically have.

569
00:30:38,237 --> 00:30:42,020
Scott: you know, it's not every every article and every two twenty six hundred ever.

570
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,573
Scott: But it's the best of twenty six hundred.

571
00:30:43,593 --> 00:30:44,460
Scott: All the important stuff.

572
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:54,699
Scott: It's all of the history of how technology got to where it is today from where it was about like, you know, twenty, thirty years ago.

573
00:30:55,500 --> 00:31:01,038
Scott: And it is if you're really if you're a tech person, you know, who's hip to the nets and whatnot, you're elite.

574
00:31:01,903 --> 00:31:03,079
Scott: This is something you got to own.

575
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,579
Scott: You can't not have this.

576
00:31:04,701 --> 00:31:06,160
Scott: You can't be out of the loop on this shit.

577
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:13,859
Rym: I mean, I feel in a way I'm glad I live when I do now because technology is just leaps and like it's accelerating at a point that I can barely even keep up.

578
00:31:14,221 --> 00:31:22,840
Rym: But at the same time, there was a certain magic to the phone freaking error that was kind of the Wild West, like the wildest of Wild West's technology.

579
00:31:23,741 --> 00:31:27,759
Rym: And we came of age and the fading days of it.

580
00:31:28,322 --> 00:31:31,519
Rym: I mean, I red boxed a little bit and then it was over.

581
00:31:32,261 --> 00:31:32,482
Scott: Yeah.

582
00:31:32,763 --> 00:31:37,790
Scott: I mean, it's like you have to you know, if you are someone who's in, you have to know where you came from.

583
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:38,639
Scott: You got to know the roots.

584
00:31:38,881 --> 00:31:46,800
Scott: You know, this is if you don't get the twenty six hundred and you think you're a tech person, that's like if you're playing PS3, you never played any essence.

585
00:31:47,163 --> 00:31:49,000
Scott: You know, you know, you don't know nothing about any essence.

586
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:49,503
Scott: You got to.

587
00:31:49,523 --> 00:31:50,799
Scott: you got to know, you know, the shit.

588
00:31:51,241 --> 00:31:57,400
Rym: So like we said, this is a tech news roundup, which means that we're just pretty much going to cover a whole bunch of tech news.

589
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:00,520
Rym: But we got a bunch of little things that we're not going to go into super depth about.

590
00:32:01,142 --> 00:32:04,320
Rym: But mostly our opinions, I think, are what matters.

591
00:32:04,541 --> 00:32:07,740
Rym: And if you don't know what the news is specifically are, you want the details.

592
00:32:08,221 --> 00:32:09,458
Rym: There's a reason we link to things.

593
00:32:09,862 --> 00:32:10,024
Scott: Yeah.

594
00:32:10,084 --> 00:32:11,519
Scott: Go to the website, read the news article.

595
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:16,579
Scott: People seem to notice how we didn't go over what the features and what the announcement for the iPhone was.

596
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,450
Scott: We just sort of gave our opinion of it.

597
00:32:18,611 --> 00:32:20,461
Scott: also because you go to engage it and read that shit.

598
00:32:20,501 --> 00:32:25,639
Rym: People seem to like the one episode where we pretty much didn't hold back very much in terms of talking about tech.

599
00:32:26,142 --> 00:32:29,460
Rym: So we're going to try to go along that line a little bit more than we used to.

600
00:32:30,065 --> 00:32:31,400
Scott: But I'm not supposed to hold back.

601
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,486
Scott: I'll stop holding back now, at

602
00:32:32,527 --> 00:32:36,304
Rym: least in terms of we're not going to explain what IP addresses are before we talk about the

603
00:32:36,445 --> 00:32:38,149
Scott: I&I, the I&I, the

604
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,252
Rym: I&I, I&I, so there's

605
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:39,954
Scott: this

606
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,643
Rym: article on Slashdot,

607
00:32:48,552 --> 00:32:48,892
Scott: you know,

608
00:32:50,115 --> 00:32:53,940
Rym: there's something about that, that specific troll that I still crack up to this day.

609
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,871
Scott: It's a funny troll.

610
00:32:55,013 --> 00:32:55,580
Scott: What can I say?

611
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:02,499
Rym: Anyway, there's this article on Slashdot that recommends an interview with John DeGose or Goays or Goays.

612
00:33:03,102 --> 00:33:06,720
Rym: And basically the gist of it with the gist is what I want to talk about.

613
00:33:07,325 --> 00:33:08,279
Rym: The headline says it all.

614
00:33:08,843 --> 00:33:11,980
Rym: Open source killing commercial developer tools.

615
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,782
Rym: Quote, some developers would rather quit their job than be forced to use a new editor IDE.

616
00:33:17,802 --> 00:33:22,742
Scott: Yeah, so let me get let me explain what this is very hard to sell these things as a result.

617
00:33:23,364 --> 00:33:29,940
Scott: OK, so there is software in the world that is meant to be used by people like, for example, Microsoft Office is meant to be used by people.

618
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:30,900
Rym: Oh, I guess we're explaining.

619
00:33:31,501 --> 00:33:31,944
Scott: Oh, shit.

620
00:33:32,065 --> 00:33:33,212
Scott: You want to I'm going to.

621
00:33:33,232 --> 00:33:34,520
Scott: I'm going to explain only a little bit.

622
00:33:35,022 --> 00:33:35,880
Rym: It's real simple.

623
00:33:36,404 --> 00:33:38,760
Rym: These are things that developers use to make software.

624
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,300
Scott: It is software made by developers for developers.

625
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:47,064
Scott: Now, people often complain about open source software usually being bad for end users like the GIMP.

626
00:33:47,426 --> 00:33:50,202
Scott: You know, as much as the GIMP is good enough for me, it's not good enough.

627
00:33:50,424 --> 00:33:52,118
Rym: It's like being the GIMP.

628
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:52,681
Scott: Right.

629
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:53,303
Scott: Exactly.

630
00:33:53,825 --> 00:34:10,418
Scott: You know, the software that is made by open source is usually not as usable for the average person because it is made by developers for they make it for their own sensibilities and being advanced users, you know, it's not going to be sensible to my grandma that as much.

631
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:20,141
Rym: Yeah, I mean, even like ReSound, I use it, but I defy a lot of people to even get ReSound to work in Ubuntu, whereas GarageBand nice and easy for those people, even those less features.

632
00:34:20,402 --> 00:34:20,563
Scott: Right.

633
00:34:21,123 --> 00:34:30,639
Scott: So what's happened is developers, you know, they make software for other people open source, but they also make software for other developers open source.

634
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:36,322
Scott: And that software that is made for other developers by open source developers has taken over the world.

635
00:34:36,362 --> 00:34:48,900
Scott: You look at stuff like Django, Ruby on Rails, all these development toolkits, all you know, the VIM, the Emacs, all these sorts of GCC, it can just go on and on.

636
00:34:49,422 --> 00:34:54,880
Scott: All these developer tools made by developers have pretty much taken over the development world.

637
00:34:55,080 --> 00:35:02,600
Rym: Now, this guy is I didn't read his whole interview, but basically he works for some company that makes this sort of software for money.

638
00:35:03,161 --> 00:35:13,740
Scott: Yeah, like stuff like Microsoft Visual Studio and stuff like that, you know, competitors in that arena not doing so well because for free you can get the best stuff there is.

639
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,908
Scott: It's not like open source.

640
00:35:14,968 --> 00:35:16,640
Scott: You can get it, but it's missing some features.

641
00:35:17,141 --> 00:35:22,822
Scott: It's when it comes to developers tools, it's open source, better than everything else and free.

642
00:35:23,003 --> 00:35:32,300
Rym: And now over time, what I want to get into the reason for this, really, I mean, people like this guy's article, it looks like he's just complaining about how it's really hard to compete in this market.

643
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:36,000
Rym: And the article is pretty much just a shill for his development thing.

644
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:36,762
Scott: Yeah, screw that.

645
00:35:37,203 --> 00:35:41,277
Rym: Yeah, but basically I'm of the mind that screw that.

646
00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:43,140
Rym: that market is dead and it should be dead.

647
00:35:43,481 --> 00:35:44,084
Rym: I'm glad it's dead.

648
00:35:44,406 --> 00:35:53,718
Rym: And the reason it's dead and the reason there's no point in making commercial software is that the main problem with most open source is that people know it's kind of like podcasting.

649
00:35:54,342 --> 00:36:00,840
Rym: You might know about audio and podcasting, but do you know about something else that's interesting to make a podcast about?

650
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:18,540
Rym: A lot of audio software sucks because most people who write software don't know a hell of a lot about audio or don't care about it, where all these open source projects often aren't good at what they do because there aren't enough people with the expertise to code these things that are also interested in making that specific software.

651
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:26,160
Rym: There is very little, let's say, hospital management software that's open source because it's not fun to write hospital management software.

652
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:35,240
Rym: But if you're a software developer and something pisses you off about your development tool, you make it better because it's the thing you definitely know about.

653
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,158
Rym: You're writing code.

654
00:36:36,462 --> 00:36:38,460
Rym: You can write code to make writing code easier.

655
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:39,683
Scott: You sure can.

656
00:36:39,723 --> 00:36:45,999
Scott: And what happens over time is someone will get a job somewhere and that place will use some proprietary development tool.

657
00:36:46,525 --> 00:36:47,659
Scott: Then they'll go somewhere else.

658
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,400
Scott: And that place used an open development tool of some kind.

659
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:55,064
Scott: And they can't use the closed development tool they were using before because someone had to pay for it.

660
00:36:55,708 --> 00:36:57,760
Scott: And over time they'll go to the next job.

661
00:36:58,162 --> 00:37:03,384
Scott: And even if that job uses a closed development tool, those open tools are still available for free.

662
00:37:03,404 --> 00:37:14,599
Scott: So what happens is over time, if developers move jobs and change habits and do stuff on their own, they will always have the open tools available to them no matter where they go or what they work on.

663
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,739
Scott: Whereas the closed tools are only available when they work in the places that have them.

664
00:37:19,221 --> 00:37:28,000
Scott: And thus, as developers continue on in their careers, their default set of development tools will always be an open set of tools.

665
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:32,820
Scott: And not only that, but the open set of tools are far superior in every possible respect.

666
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:43,165
Rym: Plus, if anyone made a commercial IDE or something that was I mean, there's an argument for visual based like Visual Studio is actually a pretty damn good idea if you're doing that sort of code.

667
00:37:43,185 --> 00:37:49,054
Scott: But it's mostly the reason people use that is because it's the only way to make like Microsoft software is to use.

668
00:37:49,094 --> 00:37:50,480
Scott: that is no there's no alternative.

669
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:50,901
Rym: Yeah.

670
00:37:51,041 --> 00:38:05,947
Rym: But like in terms of if, say, some commercial company made an IDE that was like a thousand times better than anything out there, whatever concepts they used, even if the code isn't stolen or shared or whatever, any developer who looks at it and goes, oh, that'd be a good feature.

671
00:38:06,028 --> 00:38:07,480
Rym: We'll just add it to their idea.

672
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,020
Scott: I mean, how many Visual Studio features are in Eclipse?

673
00:38:10,581 --> 00:38:11,004
Scott: Most of them.

674
00:38:11,448 --> 00:38:13,000
Rym: Man, Eclipse has come a long way.

675
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,873
Rym: I'll say this much.

676
00:38:13,995 --> 00:38:14,158
Rym: Yeah.

677
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,619
Scott: I mean, if you're doing Java, Eclipse is the way to go.

678
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:19,780
Scott: You can use it for other things, but for Java, it's definitely it's worthwhile.

679
00:38:20,401 --> 00:38:20,582
Rym: Yeah.

680
00:38:20,622 --> 00:38:26,253
Rym: Granted, I don't write a lot of code, so I pretty much use notepad plus plus or VI to write my Python CV.

681
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:30,300
Scott: I made a text editor made by people who texted it all day.

682
00:38:30,421 --> 00:38:31,476
Scott: They make VI with VI.

683
00:38:32,021 --> 00:38:32,503
Scott: Think about that.

684
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:36,300
Scott: The VI is going to turn out real well if you make it with itself.

685
00:38:36,902 --> 00:38:37,819
Scott: So today's what Monday?

686
00:38:38,562 --> 00:38:40,917
Rym: It is Monday night, Monday, June, Monday, the 16th.

687
00:38:41,683 --> 00:38:42,960
Scott: Two thousand and eight.

688
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:46,658
Scott: So last Friday was the 13th because even Monday the 16th, you have a Friday, the 13th.

689
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:49,437
Scott: And when you have a Friday, the 13th, you have a Thursday, the 12th.

690
00:38:51,001 --> 00:38:53,935
Rym: Yeah, but you also have Wednesday, the 11th, Tuesday, the 17th.

691
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:55,945
Scott: Dum, dum, dum.

692
00:38:56,347 --> 00:39:02,638
Scott: If anyone knows about the famous Ren and Stimpy episode with the bad juju, Tuesday, the 17th, which only occurs on their Friday, the 13th.

693
00:39:04,683 --> 00:39:05,938
Rym: I wonder how intentional that was.

694
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:06,742
Scott: Very intentional.

695
00:39:06,762 --> 00:39:18,892
Scott: Anyway, the Tuesday, the 17th, tomorrow is a very special Tuesday, the 17th, perhaps one of the most special Tuesday, 17th ever because Firefox three is going to be released, not just release.

696
00:39:18,933 --> 00:39:20,600
Scott: candidate did the full deal.

697
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,299
Scott: It's going to be out, out, out, out, out for the real deal.

698
00:39:23,902 --> 00:39:24,790
Scott: Time to upgrade.

699
00:39:24,831 --> 00:39:25,740
Scott: Forget Firefox two.

700
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,649
Scott: Firefox two is dead.

701
00:39:26,669 --> 00:39:27,479
Scott: It sucks.

702
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:28,710
Scott: Everyone knows it sucks.

703
00:39:28,953 --> 00:39:29,539
Scott: It sucks a lot.

704
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:30,829
Scott: Firefox three.

705
00:39:31,356 --> 00:39:31,720
Scott: Awesome.

706
00:39:32,121 --> 00:39:32,865
Scott: Super awesome.

707
00:39:32,905 --> 00:39:35,440
Scott: Not perfect, but a lot better than every other web browser.

708
00:39:36,381 --> 00:39:44,320
Scott: And the Mozilla people, what they're going to try to do is they're going to say we want to have the most downloads ever of a software program in one day.

709
00:39:44,680 --> 00:40:01,884
Scott: So the more people that download Firefox three, you are going to be part of a Guinness Book of World Record, which will hopefully, if that is achieved, provide additional stimulus and, you know, I guess advertising in a way to for Firefox, increase the word of mouth.

710
00:40:02,249 --> 00:40:03,119
Scott: We'll get the word out there.

711
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,184
Scott: Some more.

712
00:40:04,284 --> 00:40:07,920
Rym: I'm of the opinion that Guinness Book is pretty much just Pablo.

713
00:40:08,223 --> 00:40:09,779
Scott: Oh, it is quite the pablum.

714
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:13,460
Scott: Regardless, it will still help the Firefox for this pablum regard.

715
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:24,960
Scott: And Firefox three, even if you don't want to upgrade to it tomorrow for the stupidity of the world record and whatnot, it should probably be used in Firefox three, no matter what kind of computer or device you are using.

716
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:28,440
Scott: If Firefox three is available, that's the browser you want to use, if possible.

717
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:31,260
Scott: Because let me tell you, I've been using it for a few months now.

718
00:40:31,941 --> 00:40:36,322
Scott: It is a thousand times superior to every other web browser that I've ever used in my entire life.

719
00:40:36,343 --> 00:40:50,720
Scott: I mean, the Firefox, two problems of crashing and running out of memory, gone, slow interface problems, gone, features missing, gone, fast, super fast, renders things nicely, perfectly.

720
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,240
Scott: Firefox three is where it's at, people.

721
00:40:53,443 --> 00:40:54,680
Scott: You got to be upgrading tomorrow.

722
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:55,879
Scott: You're probably listening to this.

723
00:40:56,281 --> 00:40:58,860
Scott: You listen to this on Tuesday because we do Monday, Monday night.

724
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:03,879
Scott: So right now, get Firefox dot com and download that shit.

725
00:41:05,321 --> 00:41:11,639
Rym: Right, so there's this article here, I'm not going to get into the specifics once again, because it's an issue that I thought I weren't holding back.

726
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:18,019
Rym: Well, yeah, but the specifics of the issue itself and why it came up in the article are not that interesting.

727
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:26,340
Rym: What's interesting and what a lot of people seem to have questions about is the whole idea of a return to sender or sender receipts on an email.

728
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:31,707
Scott: Because isn't that when I send a thingy, but I want to get a notification that you opened it?

729
00:41:32,141 --> 00:41:36,180
Rym: Now, I mean, a lot of commercial or like office things do that like exchange.

730
00:41:36,621 --> 00:41:42,419
Rym: You can tell it to use a receipt and then whenever you open an email, it'll say, hey, do you want to send a sender receipt?

731
00:41:42,782 --> 00:41:45,860
Rym: And most people click never and then check never, ever again.

732
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:56,500
Scott: Yeah, but the idea is that it gives you an a possible way, right, for you to send someone an email and then if they want to, they can let you know they got it.

733
00:41:56,661 --> 00:41:57,317
Scott: That's all it is.

734
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:09,440
Rym: Granted, at least in corporations, I very much like and used a lot the idea that that is not an option and that you will know the second that anyone read an email that you send in the corporation.

735
00:42:10,281 --> 00:42:12,380
Rym: And where I worked before at the hospital, it was set up that way.

736
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,738
Rym: And at IBM, it was set up that way.

737
00:42:14,541 --> 00:42:35,140
Rym: And that was possibly the best thing ever when I would inform someone of something and then they didn't do it or they complained when their server got turned off, despite the fact that something 10 emails telling them I was going to turn it off and voicemails and that could point and say, well, on Monday you read the email that said that I was going to turn it off on Tuesday.

738
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,580
Rym: You read the critical high priority email that said I was going to turn it off.

739
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:39,917
Rym: You obviously did nothing.

740
00:42:41,463 --> 00:42:42,037
Scott: Good times.

741
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:46,799
Rym: Yeah, but a lot of people are really freaked out by this and a lot of people get really nervous about it.

742
00:42:47,081 --> 00:42:57,183
Rym: And then these companies come along and say, ah, we've got a special technology where if you send someone an email, we can tell you when they read it, we can tell you how long they read it.

743
00:42:57,405 --> 00:42:59,500
Rym: We can make it so they can't forward it to other people.

744
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:01,277
Rym: We can make it so it self-destructs.

745
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:02,367
Scott: You can do that.

746
00:43:02,873 --> 00:43:03,419
Rym: Here's the deal.

747
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,038
Scott: Pretty much I can always copy paste the text out.

748
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,690
Rym: Well, the way are.

749
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:08,860
Rym: let's tackle these in order.

750
00:43:09,261 --> 00:43:21,378
Rym: First off, the way most spam does that is they'll include an image, either an invisible like one pixel by one pixel, a little spliff of an image there or just the whole email will be an image.

751
00:43:21,945 --> 00:43:23,500
Rym: And the image is not an embedded image.

752
00:43:23,941 --> 00:43:29,240
Rym: It links back to a server somewhere and then they know if that image got downloaded.

753
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:43,421
Rym: So if you put this little one pixel by one pixel and you make the file name unique for each one in each email you send out, like some sort of serial number, then, you know, if someone visited and read that email because then their client went out and got that image.

754
00:43:44,565 --> 00:43:50,119
Rym: Of course, Google and smart clients just don't allow images from untrusted clients explicitly allow.

755
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:55,078
Scott: You don't see the images in your email until you click a button that says display images so that that plan doesn't work.

756
00:43:55,824 --> 00:43:56,578
Scott: Try try again.

757
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:01,804
Rym: So but the thing is, a lot of people just click that anyway or use clients where that's the default.

758
00:44:01,945 --> 00:44:04,500
Rym: So it actually works pretty well to find out if someone read an email.

759
00:44:05,421 --> 00:44:10,285
Rym: Now, the way they go one step further, let's say they want to know how long someone read an email.

760
00:44:10,629 --> 00:44:11,580
Rym: This is so clever.

761
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:20,060
Rym: They'll embed another invisible image, but they'll throttle the rate so that it sends pixels at a time or bytes at a time.

762
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:28,959
Rym: And the email client, if it's stupid, which most email clients are, will slowly read this image as long as it's open and stop reading it once you close the email.

763
00:44:29,942 --> 00:44:40,040
Rym: So you can pretty cleverly figure out how long someone read an email within a reasonable error of certainty or error of window of certainty or reasonable error.

764
00:44:41,001 --> 00:44:51,763
Scott: Another thing people do is they send you an email, right, that's actually a big image, but they use some other magic and they can figure out exactly where you clicked on the email.

765
00:44:51,884 --> 00:44:57,360
Scott: Like, did you click on this link or that link, you know, and all the different links on the email are actually slightly different.

766
00:44:57,742 --> 00:45:02,224
Scott: So when you click on one link or another, they take you to the same place that the spam wants you to go to.

767
00:45:02,546 --> 00:45:05,865
Scott: But because the links were named differently, their Web service is aha.

768
00:45:05,925 --> 00:45:07,120
Scott: He must have clicked on that link.

769
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:11,100
Scott: So now they know which links in the email are getting clicked on more.

770
00:45:11,361 --> 00:45:15,760
Scott: And then they adjust the way their spam looks to sort of get more clicks from people.

771
00:45:16,302 --> 00:45:18,680
Rym: Now, a lot of people really freak out about this.

772
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:21,420
Rym: And one, I don't care at all.

773
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:22,878
Scott: I really don't care either.

774
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:30,559
Rym: I'm fine with people knowing if I read an email or didn't read an email, because let's be honest, if I don't, I'll just say don't send a sender a receipt this time.

775
00:45:30,981 --> 00:45:41,861
Rym: The only reason to not want someone to know that you read their email is if you plan on avoiding them or whatever they tried to send you without having to tell them to their face.

776
00:45:42,524 --> 00:45:46,600
Scott: Well, I also do it sometimes where I don't want people to think I read the email.

777
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:47,959
Scott: It's like a long time to reply.

778
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:51,620
Scott: I want people to think, but I read the email and then take a long time to reply.

779
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,440
Rym: I know it was there and I didn't read it purposefully.

780
00:45:54,822 --> 00:45:56,060
Scott: I want to read the email.

781
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:00,202
Scott: I want people to think I read the email and replied relatively quickly, like within a day.

782
00:46:00,242 --> 00:46:02,239
Rym: Yes, but obviously that's not true.

783
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,060
Scott: Well, it is most of the time.

784
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:04,908
Scott: It is true, actually.

785
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:06,200
Rym: You know, the email was there.

786
00:46:06,281 --> 00:46:07,456
Rym: You just didn't respond to it.

787
00:46:08,081 --> 00:46:12,487
Rym: I guess you saw it there and you decided like say you knew that there's an email, but he has left.

788
00:46:12,507 --> 00:46:13,219
Scott: There's no receipt.

789
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:16,039
Scott: Then they might have some doubts that maybe I didn't read it.

790
00:46:16,282 --> 00:46:17,779
Rym: Oh, yeah, but that's the thing.

791
00:46:18,301 --> 00:46:20,679
Rym: It's just you trying to pull the wool over on them.

792
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:21,689
Scott: That's fine.

793
00:46:21,729 --> 00:46:22,539
Scott: I like to pull the wool.

794
00:46:22,841 --> 00:46:25,300
Scott: I think the difference I'm pulling the wool without actually lying.

795
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:29,187
Rym: The difference in philosophy here can be summed up pretty easily because you saw this a lot in the early days of.

796
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:30,559
Rym: I am and I'm sure you still do.

797
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,340
Rym: I just don't pay attention anymore.

798
00:46:32,761 --> 00:46:38,504
Rym: But I remember you always had the option of let other people know when I'm online or idle or don't.

799
00:46:38,946 --> 00:46:41,319
Rym: let other people know when I'm typing or don't.

800
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,400
Rym: And I've always allowed people to have this information.

801
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:51,260
Scott: The only one I don't do is know what I'm typing because sometimes I'll type and then I'll say, oh, actually, I didn't want to say anything.

802
00:46:51,321 --> 00:46:53,160
Scott: And then they'll be like, well, what are you going to say?

803
00:46:53,261 --> 00:46:54,919
Scott: And I'm like, I decided not to.

804
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:56,011
Rym: I let it go anyway.

805
00:46:56,153 --> 00:46:56,619
Rym: And you know what?

806
00:46:57,541 --> 00:46:59,120
Rym: Google lets me know when you're typing.

807
00:46:59,481 --> 00:46:59,964
Scott: That's fine.

808
00:47:01,696 --> 00:47:02,340
Scott: I just, you know, it's.

809
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:05,659
Scott: Sometimes I want to, you know, I don't want if I can avoid going, oh, yeah.

810
00:47:06,081 --> 00:47:07,340
Scott: And and what?

811
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:08,362
Scott: Never mind.

812
00:47:08,705 --> 00:47:10,197
Scott: If I can avoid that, that's OK by me.

813
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:18,703
Rym: But pretty much just a final bit here about this news, a lot of these companies try to say something like, hey, we can send you an email that you can't forward or an email that you can't.

814
00:47:19,008 --> 00:47:19,760
Rym: That's impossible.

815
00:47:20,161 --> 00:47:20,864
Scott: That is impossible.

816
00:47:20,964 --> 00:47:26,584
Rym: Absolutely impossible unless they set up some sort of proprietary system, which one.

817
00:47:26,604 --> 00:47:34,640
Rym: you're just not going to use their system or some sort of active X. use the open GL driver to send something directly.

818
00:47:35,001 --> 00:47:35,689
Scott: Here's what you can do.

819
00:47:35,771 --> 00:47:36,419
Scott: Here's what you can do.

820
00:47:36,681 --> 00:47:38,255
Scott: I can send an email to them, right?

821
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:41,520
Scott: They take a screenshot of the email and turn it into an image.

822
00:47:41,841 --> 00:47:45,159
Scott: They email the image to the other guy that I actually want to send it to.

823
00:47:45,641 --> 00:47:49,279
Scott: Then they check to see when the images are requested and by who.

824
00:47:49,821 --> 00:47:55,216
Scott: And then they check, you know, to see if that's actually the person the mail is mailed to in his cash.

825
00:47:55,297 --> 00:47:55,480
Scott: Right.

826
00:47:55,740 --> 00:48:00,943
Scott: And if that email gets forwarded to someone, then it won't load the image and they won't see any email.

827
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:07,880
Scott: But that person can always just take the image, save it an email to someone or copy and paste or any sort of thing like that.

828
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:19,691
Rym: All these sorts of soft or fake DRM that are applied to otherwise open protocols or standards are just instill a false sense of security and are pretty much nothing but scams.

829
00:48:19,773 --> 00:48:20,160
Scott: Pretty much.

830
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:24,860
Scott: Yeah, there's a few problems in the world that you may not realize are problems.

831
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:28,480
Rym: The fact that I have to carry four power strips with me when I go anywhere.

832
00:48:28,704 --> 00:48:29,620
Scott: That is a problem.

833
00:48:29,881 --> 00:48:38,399
Scott: There is also the problem that many devices that you plug in and to charge will actually constantly, you know, take electricity out of the wall even when they don't need it.

834
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:45,919
Rym: You know, also the fact that a lot of different electronic devices use completely different plugs and completely different like adapters to get their power.

835
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:46,420
Rym: Yep.

836
00:48:46,782 --> 00:48:55,360
Scott: And in a way, that's good because every different device has sort of its own proprietary rechargeable battery, which is sort of bad in the proprietariness.

837
00:48:55,762 --> 00:49:03,819
Scott: But it's good and that these batteries are custom for the devices that they're for rather than every device having to adapt to use double A's or triple A's.

838
00:49:04,223 --> 00:49:05,639
Scott: You know, it's much more efficient that way.

839
00:49:05,881 --> 00:49:12,739
Scott: And, you know, you can design batteries to be just strong enough for the device and have the charge for the correct amount of time and all that good stuff.

840
00:49:13,922 --> 00:49:20,060
Scott: So someone has come up with sort of a solution, but the solution won't take off unless more people get on the bandwagon.

841
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,079
Scott: The solution is green plug thing now.

842
00:49:23,521 --> 00:49:36,119
Scott: First of all, for the environmentally curious people, right, this thing will save a lot of electricity if people use it, because all that stand by electricity usage, that just won't happen with this thing.

843
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:39,400
Scott: It's designed to not let you use electricity when you don't need it.

844
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,140
Rym: This is the kind of thing that has been a long time coming.

845
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:47,124
Rym: The idea that you can I mean, we have two way communication with almost every piece of electronics.

846
00:49:47,144 --> 00:49:52,979
Rym: I mean, printers used to be one way a lot of times, but now the printer can talk back and say, hey, I didn't print that.

847
00:49:53,501 --> 00:49:58,600
Rym: Why can't my cell phone tell the adapter, hey, stop powering that transformer?

848
00:49:58,740 --> 00:49:59,190
Rym: I'm done.

849
00:49:59,435 --> 00:49:59,660
Rym: Yep.

850
00:50:00,141 --> 00:50:03,960
Scott: So what this green plug thing is, is it's a universal plug.

851
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:21,462
Scott: Their goal is that I guess as many electronic devices as possible, perhaps every electronic device, you know, iPods, cell phones, Nintendo DS's, PSP's, you know, your Bluetooth earpiece, you know, anything that needs charging, right, that you have.

852
00:50:21,502 --> 00:50:25,620
Scott: your laptop will instead of, you know, like my laptop has a power cable.

853
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:27,640
Scott: My DS is different power cable, right?

854
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:34,207
Scott: That instead, everyone will just use their power cable, the green thing, the green bug, whatever it's called,

855
00:50:34,709 --> 00:50:34,971
Rym: and no

856
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:44,060
Scott: one will use any other kind of power cable and everyone will just make their device to use this thing, which is a great idea, because, first of all, you just have to carry one of these bad boys around.

857
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:47,243
Scott: You can charge everything and you won't have to worry about carrying separate shit.

858
00:50:47,324 --> 00:50:48,539
Scott: That's great, too.

859
00:50:49,041 --> 00:50:51,280
Scott: We could actually like build these things into the wall.

860
00:50:51,481 --> 00:50:54,039
Scott: If, you know, if it's just universal, why not?

861
00:50:54,562 --> 00:50:55,044
Rym: Oh, man.

862
00:50:55,065 --> 00:51:02,754
Rym: Well, the thing is, even way back when I was thinking about, hey, I should buy a house, I toyed with the idea of having some DC for all the servers and things we have.

863
00:51:02,836 --> 00:51:03,020
Rym: Yep.

864
00:51:03,942 --> 00:51:08,020
Scott: And number three, this thing does the two way communication with your device.

865
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:20,278
Scott: So you look at the plug and it will tell you which devices that are plugged into it are charged, how much they're charged, how much electricity you've saved, how much you've used, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

866
00:51:20,621 --> 00:51:22,599
Scott: And you could actually price set options on it.

867
00:51:22,981 --> 00:51:27,999
Scott: There's a lot of possibilities there and they've only really scratched the surface with the kind of stuff that you could do.

868
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:35,860
Scott: Like, you know, like you could tell it, hey, you know, only charge my laptop up or, hey, you know, forget everything else.

869
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:39,239
Scott: I need my laptop charge really quickly or all kinds of good stuff like that.

870
00:51:40,002 --> 00:51:55,960
Scott: And if more companies start using this instead of using their own personal proprietary cables for every single different device, then the world would probably be a lot better place overall and a lot more convenient for everyone who uses electricity and has portable device and convenience aside.

871
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:13,240
Rym: I mean, I know environmentalism, not just from a from all and there's all these different perspectives on it, but there's a very practical element here, regardless of your feelings and all these things to conserving electricity, because energy is becoming the rarest and most important commodity in the world.

872
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:19,958
Scott: You know, actually, even more than saving electricity by using this device, you know what the biggest impact on the environment is going to be?

873
00:52:20,702 --> 00:52:32,300
Scott: The fact that instead of having a hundred different factories around the world making all sorts of different plugs, there'll be one factory making the same exact plug over and over again, which is a thousand times more efficient.

874
00:52:32,605 --> 00:52:33,359
Rym: I didn't even think of that.

875
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:33,763
Rym: Yes.

876
00:52:33,803 --> 00:52:36,080
Scott: And that's the kind of thing that the people don't think of that anyway.

877
00:52:36,501 --> 00:52:39,759
Scott: If you want to save energy, factories are the place to save the most energy.

878
00:52:40,122 --> 00:52:42,060
Rym: There's there's zoom out economy of scale.

879
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:42,441
Scott: Exactly.

880
00:52:42,461 --> 00:52:50,420
Rym: That's why electric cars are in many ways a good idea, because then you've separated the you can do the conversion to electricity much more efficiently.

881
00:52:50,822 --> 00:52:52,480
Scott: Yeah, there's a lot of factors.

882
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:53,387
Rym: Oh, yeah, there's a lot there.

883
00:52:53,427 --> 00:52:54,799
Rym: I could I could talk for hours about that.

884
00:52:55,100 --> 00:53:05,306
Rym: The point is, Westinghouse, which is not the biggest player, has decided they're on way to quote the article, but quote someone from Westinghouse, we're not the biggest player.

885
00:53:05,408 --> 00:53:06,400
Scott: I didn't I didn't read the article.

886
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:07,998
Scott: I didn't read that, but we're the first.

887
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:09,505
Scott: That's true.

888
00:53:10,069 --> 00:53:11,840
Scott: They've their first company on board with this.

889
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,020
Scott: And I hope that maybe we can get, say, I don't know, Sony on here.

890
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:17,085
Scott: Maybe that would help.

891
00:53:17,347 --> 00:53:20,020
Scott: No, you realize what's going to happen about Fujitsu.

892
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:20,766
Scott: Have a Samsung.

893
00:53:21,048 --> 00:53:22,160
Scott: Samsung, you help us out.

894
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,020
Rym: No, you realize exactly what's going to happen.

895
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:24,805
Rym: So what?

896
00:53:24,906 --> 00:53:26,800
Rym: Samsung is going to jump on board with this right away.

897
00:53:27,041 --> 00:53:31,448
Rym: And so is Microsoft, like for whatever things they sell, then Google will put put on their Android.

898
00:53:31,489 --> 00:53:32,079
Scott: Where are you at?

899
00:53:32,402 --> 00:53:33,260
Scott: But then Nokia.

900
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:40,840
Rym: But then Sony is going to release blue plug and blue plug is going to be one percent faster at recharging.

901
00:53:41,363 --> 00:53:43,600
Rym: But it turns out you can only plug it into Sony products.

902
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:44,884
Scott: That's just fantastic.

903
00:53:44,924 --> 00:53:56,029
Scott: I mean, it's like if they did that, even if they had a universal plug for each company, like the Fujitsu plug, the Sony plug, that would still be a thousand times better than I guess now.

904
00:53:56,049 --> 00:53:58,402
Rym: I would only need the Apple slash Nintendo plug.

905
00:53:58,603 --> 00:54:02,240
Scott: I know right now, but I hope that this happens and we should.

906
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:06,120
Rym: This idea is not just for portable consumer electronics for everything.

907
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:07,665
Rym: The idea of a universal plug

908
00:54:07,886 --> 00:54:08,087
Scott: TV

909
00:54:08,288 --> 00:54:24,260
Rym: for LCDs, for my Marantz, for every piece of electronics, because one of the biggest things where we waste electricity and power and energy in the modern world today is the inefficient distribution of power, the inefficient management of power, the wiring in most houses in this country.

910
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:25,619
Rym: Is atrocious.

911
00:54:26,822 --> 00:54:26,963
Rym: Yep.

912
00:54:26,983 --> 00:54:38,960
Scott: And vacuum cleaners and TVs and all these things, if we just manage everything has its own power supply and they're all different and the power system in your house knows nothing about these power supplies.

913
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:49,162
Scott: If the if there was more communication between the power in the house and the grid and the actual power you need to use, we could distribute it a lot more efficiently, a lot more.

914
00:54:49,283 --> 00:54:51,280
Rym: We can't make end to end intelligence.

915
00:54:51,442 --> 00:54:52,880
Scott: In fact, that's ludicrous.

916
00:54:53,380 --> 00:55:00,220
Rym: I mean, there's there's been a long standing argument both in telecommunications and in power transform, transfer.

917
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:04,659
Rym: I was going to say transferring transmission and I was also going to say transformation, but I meant transmission.

918
00:55:05,361 --> 00:55:05,622
Scott: Yes.

919
00:55:05,782 --> 00:55:15,840
Rym: But the idea of do you make the network dumb and the nodes intelligent or the nodes dumb and the network intelligent and their arguments equally in both direction?

920
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,519
Scott: You could make the whole thing intelligent, but that's ludicrous.

921
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:19,400
Rym: But I'm ambivalent on the issue.

922
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:25,943
Rym: But I think the best place to start is at the end point level with power, with consumer technology.

923
00:55:26,324 --> 00:55:39,680
Rym: And then from there, with houses, I envision the day where regardless of what happens with the grid in the future, there is the demark point to my house and then my house will have a computerized intelligent power distribution system.

924
00:55:40,243 --> 00:55:40,445
Scott: Yep.

925
00:55:40,788 --> 00:55:42,140
Scott: I mean, think about it right now.

926
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:46,240
Scott: The actual devices themselves are as intelligent as they're going to be.

927
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:51,367
Scott: The next step is to make between the devices in the wall because that's the step we're looking at now.

928
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:52,620
Rym: The house is stupid.

929
00:55:52,780 --> 00:56:01,307
Scott: And once if we get to that point where everything is powered by with the same green bug thingy, then we can make the house intelligent and then we can work our way up from there.

930
00:56:01,835 --> 00:56:02,079
Scott: You know.

931
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:02,582
Rym: All right.

932
00:56:02,622 --> 00:56:13,340
Rym: But I think we have to get on to our other big news, because while I really want to talk about Verizon dropping all net, which I don't care about, but I'm sure some people do not actually that hungry.

933
00:56:13,481 --> 00:56:13,883
Scott: I'm hungry.

934
00:56:14,225 --> 00:56:18,979
Rym: And I really want to talk about this Wall Street becoming a Linux stronghold article, because it's totally true.

935
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:19,644
Scott: It's totally true.

936
00:56:19,987 --> 00:56:21,419
Rym: And there's a lot of reasons for that.

937
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:38,605
Rym: And I really, really, really want to talk about how the EFF won that case about first sale in terms of promo CDs, because first sale, if nothing else, mark my words, the doctrine of first sale is going to become one of the biggest fucking issues in the next three or four years.

938
00:56:38,766 --> 00:56:40,780
Scott: I say the next one or two years, it's going to be huge.

939
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:42,340
Scott: And I think it's actually going to be settled.

940
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:45,040
Scott: And I'm predicting now be settled in our favor.

941
00:56:45,421 --> 00:56:46,044
Rym: Well, you know what?

942
00:56:46,566 --> 00:56:50,065
Rym: If it is not settled in our favor, we still win, but we'll talk about that.

943
00:56:50,106 --> 00:56:50,349
Scott: All right.

944
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:58,520
Rym: All right, people, for the next Monday show, do you want cyber warfare or do you want first sale doctrine for a sale?

945
00:56:58,580 --> 00:56:59,659
Scott: That shouldn't even really a Monday.

946
00:56:59,941 --> 00:57:03,320
Rym: I think the technology, the technology issues surrounding it alone.

947
00:57:03,624 --> 00:57:03,969
Scott: It is.

948
00:57:03,989 --> 00:57:04,659
Scott: We could do that.

949
00:57:04,961 --> 00:57:05,651
Rym: It could be a Thursday.

950
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:06,159
Rym: All right.

951
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:06,621
Rym: We'll see.

952
00:57:06,842 --> 00:57:10,800
Scott: So instead, we have to talk about this big news of metering.

953
00:57:11,508 --> 00:57:12,500
Scott: By your eyes, please.

954
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:21,057
Rym: Now, this is such a complicated issue that we cannot do it justice in, I don't know, the last 20 minutes of this show.

955
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:22,859
Scott: Are you really going to die over 20 minutes?

956
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:23,401
Rym: I don't know.

957
00:57:23,421 --> 00:57:39,720
Rym: But I think what the fundamental issue is, the core, if we go all the way down to the bottom, we get as far down as we can go, is that the ISPs in the United States, pretty much since the beginning of broadband, have been lying.

958
00:57:40,001 --> 00:57:40,262
Rym: Yep.

959
00:57:40,543 --> 00:57:45,962
Rym: They have been saying to people, look, unlimited, here's the speed we give you up and down.

960
00:57:46,203 --> 00:57:51,024
Rym: In the best case, we will give you unlimited bandwidth and it costs X per month.

961
00:57:51,268 --> 00:57:51,940
Scott: Use it all day.

962
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:52,786
Scott: Use it all night.

963
00:57:52,826 --> 00:57:54,220
Scott: We don't care how much you use it.

964
00:57:54,621 --> 00:57:56,078
Scott: We're going to set the speed on you.

965
00:57:56,603 --> 00:57:57,371
Scott: But that's it.

966
00:57:57,755 --> 00:57:58,119
Rym: You know what?

967
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:02,180
Rym: The only reason that was viable back then was there's a little secret.

968
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:11,260
Rym: The dirty secret of the Internet was because they assumed, much like Jim's, that 99 percent of users would use maybe one percent of that capacity.

969
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:12,939
Scott: I posted this whole thing in the forum.

970
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:20,399
Scott: But yeah, if you go to like a workout gym, like Gold's Gym or New York Sports Club or Equinox or whatever kind of gym you have near you.

971
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:20,761
Scott: Right.

972
00:58:20,782 --> 00:58:22,500
Rym: I'm thinking about getting a gym membership, actually.

973
00:58:22,901 --> 00:58:23,860
Scott: New York Sports Club isn't bad.

974
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:24,880
Rym: You can take a shower.

975
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:26,100
Rym: In the winter, right?

976
00:58:26,281 --> 00:58:27,940
Rym: In the summer, I don't care because I do all this stuff.

977
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:30,600
Rym: But in the winter, one, there's one right next to Grand Central.

978
00:58:30,961 --> 00:58:31,223
Rym: Yep.

979
00:58:31,465 --> 00:58:33,140
Rym: And two, I can shower.

980
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:33,702
Rym: Yep.

981
00:58:33,922 --> 00:58:38,524
Rym: So, yeah, I'm thinking about then I could bike to work where my pajamas on the train.

982
00:58:38,605 --> 00:58:40,300
Scott: If I lived in the city, I would get one.

983
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:41,168
Scott: I won the head of pool.

984
00:58:41,188 --> 00:58:42,139
Scott: It's like a swim.

985
00:58:42,541 --> 00:58:42,722
Scott: Yeah.

986
00:58:42,823 --> 00:58:45,639
Rym: Anyway, of course, if I lived in the city, I'd live in a building that had a pool.

987
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:46,543
Scott: Yes, that, too.

988
00:58:46,944 --> 00:58:51,586
Scott: And so with my millions and my diamond shoes, we get this one pool building in Brooklyn.

989
00:58:51,606 --> 00:58:53,220
Scott: I know we can afford, but the pool is small anyway.

990
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:59,020
Rym: And also, as much as I like Brooklyn, I would rather live in either Manhattan or I don't know, on the Hudson line.

991
00:58:59,461 --> 00:59:00,720
Scott: I'd like to live anyway.

992
00:59:02,102 --> 00:59:03,440
Scott: So metering the Internet's right.

993
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,165
Scott: What was I saying?

994
00:59:04,306 --> 00:59:06,140
Rym: I didn't even get to my my my point.

995
00:59:06,301 --> 00:59:14,039
Scott: So much like gyms, the way gym membership works, like if you own a Gold's gym, the way you make your money is you have a membership drive around New Year's.

996
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:16,380
Scott: You get all the fat people to sign up for your gym.

997
00:59:16,541 --> 00:59:16,663
Scott: Right.

998
00:59:16,703 --> 00:59:18,080
Scott: And you say, come on, lose weight, people.

999
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:19,359
Scott: It's only like 30 bucks a month.

1000
00:59:19,703 --> 00:59:21,320
Scott: And they go woo and they sign up.

1001
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:29,639
Rym: And let me tell you, if you're a member of a gym, pretty much the three weeks after New Year's are hell because there's a million people who have never been to a gym before.

1002
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:36,900
Rym: Half of them don't even have gym clothes, desperately trying to use the treadmill and maybe the Stairmaster.

1003
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:38,600
Rym: Yeah, because they're afraid of everything else.

1004
00:59:38,942 --> 00:59:41,744
Rym: And then there's all the other people who think they're going to lift weights, but don't know how.

1005
00:59:42,086 --> 00:59:43,499
Rym: And then none of those people will be back.

1006
00:59:43,801 --> 00:59:44,022
Scott: Right.

1007
00:59:44,123 --> 00:59:47,987
Scott: And but those people, you know, they don't cancel or they you know, it's sort of like World of Warcraft.

1008
00:59:48,007 --> 00:59:49,300
Rym: They realize they can't cancel.

1009
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:50,799
Rym: There's usually a fee that do.

1010
00:59:51,281 --> 00:59:54,720
Scott: So these people keep paying and paying and paying, but they're not using the facilities.

1011
00:59:55,063 --> 00:59:56,620
Scott: And that's how gyms make all their money.

1012
00:59:56,740 --> 01:00:06,602
Scott: If gyms actually had that New Year's traffic all year, they would go out of business because they couldn't afford to buy all of those workout machines to have all those people.

1013
01:00:06,622 --> 01:00:10,314
Rym: But at the same time, that would mean there's enough demand that they could just raise their prices or their gyms.

1014
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:11,202
Scott: That, too.

1015
01:00:11,425 --> 01:00:12,619
Rym: But that's not how it is.

1016
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:13,405
Scott: That's not how it is.

1017
01:00:13,425 --> 01:00:15,280
Scott: They have they they make money.

1018
01:00:15,501 --> 01:00:20,900
Scott: They make good profits because they can have less facilities available.

1019
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:26,880
Scott: They don't have to actually supply to meet the potential demand of the customer.

1020
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:28,219
Scott: And the ISP is the same way.

1021
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:30,220
Scott: They could have a thousand customers.

1022
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:31,021
Scott: Right.

1023
01:00:31,322 --> 01:00:39,000
Scott: And only actually have enough real bandwidth available for like a hundred of them because only 10 percent of the people are actually using it at any one time.

1024
01:00:39,503 --> 01:00:42,119
Rym: I now now here is the rub, if you will.

1025
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:47,500
Rym: The Internet is that times a hundred billion billion.

1026
01:00:48,083 --> 01:00:49,840
Rym: I mean, let's cut back in the day.

1027
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:50,141
Rym: Right.

1028
01:00:50,542 --> 01:00:54,495
Rym: Way back, I happen to live in a place where I had a cable modem.

1029
01:00:55,217 --> 01:00:58,120
Rym: when I was in early high school, like ninth grade, I had a cable modem.

1030
01:00:58,744 --> 01:01:00,640
Rym: And my friends had a cable modem.

1031
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:06,560
Rym: And like our area, we all got cable modems and everyone was like, oh, snap, cable modems, fast Internet all the time, cheap, whatever.

1032
01:01:06,721 --> 01:01:07,660
Rym: It was this trial rollout.

1033
01:01:08,121 --> 01:01:11,080
Rym: So we all had them and they advertised unlimited speed.

1034
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:17,240
Rym: And I looked and realized, wait a minute, I can upload and download as much as I want.

1035
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:19,820
Rym: My computer can be on 24/7.

1036
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:23,880
Rym: My computer can be on the Internet when I am not on my computer.

1037
01:01:25,021 --> 01:01:36,878
Rym: And I started downloading things and pretty much I maxed out my pipe from the moment I got my cable modem until the moment I turned off the computer before a thunderstorm like three months later.

1038
01:01:38,401 --> 01:01:45,500
Rym: And I'm pretty sure that I personally accounted for a significant percentage of the bandwidth used in that trial period.

1039
01:01:46,481 --> 01:01:50,480
Rym: There are a lot of people like me nowadays and a lot of people aren't just downloading.

1040
01:01:50,961 --> 01:01:51,820
Rym: They're uploading.

1041
01:01:53,142 --> 01:01:55,839
Rym: The Internet cannot stand as it is.

1042
01:01:56,320 --> 01:02:03,740
Scott: Yes, for ISPs to be able to handle all this bandwidth, you know, as much as people are yelling at their ISPs thinking they're up to evil or lying, they're not.

1043
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:12,560
Scott: To be able to handle all this bandwidth of all these YouTube people and BitTorrent people, you know, BitTorrent people, they're going to have to buy a lot more cables.

1044
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:15,980
Scott: People talk about the dark fiber, you know, much it takes to turn on dark fiber.

1045
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:17,720
Rym: Plus, a lot of that dark fiber is useless.

1046
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:19,487
Scott: Yes, they're going to have to spend.

1047
01:02:19,668 --> 01:02:29,820
Scott: if you're an ISP and you actually want to be able to handle all this new bandwidth that people are using, you're going to have to spend so much money on laying new cables, getting new routers, the whole thing.

1048
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:31,780
Scott: It's it's going to be insane.

1049
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:35,400
Rym: So wait, wait, wait, wait, because that's not 100 percent true.

1050
01:02:35,761 --> 01:02:38,419
Rym: The evil part, because this is what bothers me.

1051
01:02:38,961 --> 01:02:39,323
Rym: All right.

1052
01:02:39,745 --> 01:02:44,363
Rym: The ISPs basically have been lying forever and saying unlimited bandwidth, even though it's not true.

1053
01:02:44,885 --> 01:02:52,520
Rym: And now because people are smart enough to use that capacity and there are ways to use that capacity that are things that normal people would be doing.

1054
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:55,040
Rym: I mean, in the early days, it didn't matter.

1055
01:02:55,420 --> 01:02:59,800
Rym: Only people like me or Scott or half of you listening were using all that bandwidth.

1056
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:00,604
Rym: Most people weren't.

1057
01:03:00,966 --> 01:03:03,280
Rym: But now a lot of people are using peer to peer.

1058
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:07,100
Rym: A lot of people are YouTube, a lot of people are running servers and all this business.

1059
01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:17,841
Rym: So because the ISPs were lying, they've kind of painted themselves into a corner where if they stop lying, all the people who still lie will get all the business, at least early on.

1060
01:03:18,463 --> 01:03:25,539
Rym: And to even if they all stop lying, consumers are going to be really mad about how they lost this thing that they had before.

1061
01:03:25,841 --> 01:03:28,940
Scott: Yeah, I mean, usually, you know, service is supposed to get better, not worse.

1062
01:03:29,060 --> 01:03:31,640
Scott: You can't be offering me less than before for more money.

1063
01:03:31,921 --> 01:03:36,260
Rym: And that's what the ISPs are offering in replacement for this.

1064
01:03:36,621 --> 01:03:40,000
Rym: The so-called metered Internet is not the solution.

1065
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:41,500
Rym: It is not a true metered Internet.

1066
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:42,799
Rym: It is basically bullshit.

1067
01:03:43,061 --> 01:03:49,180
Scott: A true metered Internet would have disadvantages, but it would also have many advantages that make it very desirable.

1068
01:03:49,462 --> 01:03:51,740
Scott: It would be for the ISPs and for the customers.

1069
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:52,605
Rym: You know what it would be like?

1070
01:03:52,645 --> 01:03:54,960
Rym: It would be just like how you pay for your electricity.

1071
01:03:55,101 --> 01:03:58,300
Rym: Now, I used X kilowatt hours, a kilowatt hour cost.

1072
01:03:59,002 --> 01:04:02,480
Scott: Maybe there'll be a flat base fee, you know, to sort of well, I was about to get to that.

1073
01:04:02,781 --> 01:04:05,380
Rym: I pay X dollars per Y kilowatt hour.

1074
01:04:05,781 --> 01:04:11,499
Rym: I also pay N dollars per month for the wires that connect to my house and give me the privilege of buying that power.

1075
01:04:12,443 --> 01:04:18,520
Rym: If the Internet were like that and I try, I don't know, a dollar a gigabyte and maybe five dollars a month for the privilege of the wire.

1076
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:21,860
Scott: Now, the thing is, there's a problem there with a dollar per gigabyte.

1077
01:04:21,940 --> 01:04:22,446
Scott: Is that OK?

1078
01:04:22,466 --> 01:04:23,459
Scott: A dollar per gigabyte now.

1079
01:04:24,101 --> 01:04:30,880
Scott: But what about a year from now when bandwidth is even getting crazier to keep that dollar per gigabyte price when the Internet gets faster?

1080
01:04:31,060 --> 01:04:32,480
Scott: We're going to be paying off the nose.

1081
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:38,899
Rym: That's why it's not a terribly analogous situation, because the price of gas and the price of electricity is not going to be going down.

1082
01:04:39,842 --> 01:04:42,560
Rym: My electricity is not going to be cheaper next year.

1083
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:45,180
Rym: My electric bill is double not my electric bill.

1084
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:46,280
Rym: My electric bill is actually less.

1085
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:48,678
Rym: My gas bill is double what it was last year.

1086
01:04:49,421 --> 01:04:49,723
Rym: Yeah.

1087
01:04:49,763 --> 01:04:52,520
Rym: Bandwidth is getting cheaper at a rate that is ludicrous.

1088
01:04:52,800 --> 01:05:05,093
Scott: So if they actually metered the Internet the way they metered water, they would have to keep charging less and less and less over time to sort of make it so that the average person, you know, they would look at the average usage.

1089
01:05:05,334 --> 01:05:07,540
Scott: so that way the average person like we pay 50 bucks.

1090
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:11,540
Scott: So they would have to keep changing how much it costs per gigabyte.

1091
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:13,796
Scott: So the average person would be paying around 50 bucks.

1092
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:15,406
Rym: Now, what they do, nothing.

1093
01:05:15,527 --> 01:05:17,560
Scott: users would pay less than the crazy users pay more.

1094
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:21,780
Rym: What they could do, which would be fair, is what most oil people people use fuel oil.

1095
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:24,259
Rym: The way they sell it is you'll buy oil, fuel oil.

1096
01:05:24,841 --> 01:05:27,398
Rym: You'll you'll negotiate or pay for a rate.

1097
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:29,699
Rym: And that rate is good for one year.

1098
01:05:30,223 --> 01:05:31,720
Rym: And you sign a contract.

1099
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:38,579
Rym: So say I sign the contract for the next year, I pay one gigabyte, one dollar a gigabyte total per month.

1100
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:43,147
Rym: And then at the end of the year, it gets renegotiated based on the current market prices.

1101
01:05:43,817 --> 01:05:43,919
Scott: Yep.

1102
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:46,900
Rym: And that's probably a safe, fair way to do it.

1103
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:47,940
Scott: That is a safe, fair way.

1104
01:05:48,261 --> 01:05:51,680
Rym: But the ISPs don't want that because that would be too good.

1105
01:05:52,060 --> 01:06:06,140
Rym: What if they pull the cell phone model, the cell phone model of you pay X dollars for one minute and then you pay a fee for minutes above that, because then you either have to buy more bandwidth than you need or not buy enough and get fucked.

1106
01:06:06,522 --> 01:06:09,760
Scott: It's like I buy 200 minutes and I only use 10.

1107
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:11,960
Scott: Great for my grandma, who only uses it for five minutes.

1108
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:12,951
Scott: Yeah, she gets ripped off.

1109
01:06:13,397 --> 01:06:13,580
Scott: Right.

1110
01:06:13,941 --> 01:06:14,406
Scott: Or me.

1111
01:06:14,426 --> 01:06:16,040
Scott: I need a bajillion minutes.

1112
01:06:16,322 --> 01:06:17,680
Scott: Well, you're going to pay a bajillion dollars.

1113
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:18,122
Scott: Oh, great.

1114
01:06:18,182 --> 01:06:18,484
Scott: Thanks.

1115
01:06:18,565 --> 01:06:21,604
Scott: Even though I went to vacation this month, you know, I didn't actually use it.

1116
01:06:21,645 --> 01:06:23,902
Scott: I still have to pay the bajillion because the use I needed next month.

1117
01:06:24,143 --> 01:06:33,538
Rym: Now, the thing is, I don't know where I want to go with this, because on one hand, I feel as though a truly metered Internet is probably the only way forward in the medium term.

1118
01:06:34,121 --> 01:06:40,844
Rym: But in the long term, bandwidth is getting cheap and also wireless technology is getting better.

1119
01:06:41,406 --> 01:06:49,600
Scott: in the is even with something like Wi-Max, the Wi-Max would go to an antenna, which would go to a pipe that is not big enough to handle the Wi-Max.

1120
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:59,820
Rym: So in the as a movie in long term, I foresee that ad hoc wireless everything transmits and receives will make this a moot point.

1121
01:06:59,820 --> 01:07:10,179
Scott: And this is the fundamental problem here is that the Internet is designed as a Web, your ISP at that level of the Internet compared when looking at all the other ISPs and not the individual people.

1122
01:07:11,022 --> 01:07:11,606
Scott: It is a Web.

1123
01:07:11,687 --> 01:07:13,800
Scott: Everyone's connected to everyone else all over the place.

1124
01:07:13,940 --> 01:07:14,403
Scott: It's a big mesh.

1125
01:07:14,544 --> 01:07:17,239
Rym: And all the routers are agreements with all the people.

1126
01:07:17,279 --> 01:07:22,119
Rym: you're connected to pairing agreements and you have agreement like you're not connected directly to some people.

1127
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:27,102
Rym: So you have agreements with other people in between to get between the networks and everyone.

1128
01:07:27,123 --> 01:07:29,500
Rym: So it's like everyone owns a bunch of a bunch of bridges.

1129
01:07:29,822 --> 01:07:32,799
Rym: And we all let each other use each other's bridges and we all charge each other tolls.

1130
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,700
Scott: Yeah, but us with our DSL and our cable modems, we're not in the Web.

1131
01:07:37,121 --> 01:07:39,960
Scott: We are actually hanging off the side in a hierarchy.

1132
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:42,679
Scott: And at the top of our hierarchy is our ISP.

1133
01:07:43,481 --> 01:07:46,260
Scott: And as a result, the ISP owns us.

1134
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:53,079
Rym: Your ISP, all of you out there, unless you have something awesome, which none of you do, maybe the places you work at do, but you do not.

1135
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:55,949
Rym: Most likely your ISP in like.

1136
01:07:55,969 --> 01:08:03,219
Rym: if you zoom out to the telco level or the like Internet level, your ISP is like this little thing kind of hanging off the end.

1137
01:08:03,661 --> 01:08:03,962
Scott: Yeah.

1138
01:08:04,263 --> 01:08:13,380
Rym: I mean, the real like the peering in the real high tier Internet server, like you go to XO and you get your circuit to the Internet and that's a whole different.

1139
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:16,038
Scott: Or you get like a direct to the Sprint link or something like that.

1140
01:08:16,180 --> 01:08:16,520
Scott: Yeah.

1141
01:08:16,541 --> 01:08:22,406
Scott: Or you go to AT&T and you say, hey, AT&T, I've got these I got these, you know, server farm here.

1142
01:08:22,446 --> 01:08:24,259
Scott: I'd like to throw a couple of DS threes your way.

1143
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:25,263
Scott: How about that?

1144
01:08:26,107 --> 01:08:30,719
Rym: Yeah, like you'll peer to the Internet through RCN or XO or something, but none of you have that.

1145
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:35,700
Rym: So the Internet is in most ways a hierarchical hierarchy.

1146
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:40,420
Scott: Are there any other kinds of hierarchies that are non-hierarchical?

1147
01:08:42,502 --> 01:08:44,460
Rym: Oh, I want to design a non-hierarchical hierarchy.

1148
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:47,140
Scott: Perhaps it would be an acute obtuse angle.

1149
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:47,786
Rym: All right.

1150
01:08:47,805 --> 01:08:48,419
Rym: I think we're done.

1151
01:08:50,242 --> 01:08:52,169
Scott: The point is metered.

1152
01:08:52,229 --> 01:08:55,160
Scott: Internet could be good, depending on how it's implemented.

1153
01:08:55,380 --> 01:08:56,300
Scott: Something has to change.

1154
01:08:56,420 --> 01:08:58,179
Scott: The false advertising is no good.

1155
01:08:58,361 --> 01:09:00,399
Scott: But the bullshit metering is also no good.

1156
01:09:00,701 --> 01:09:09,759
Rym: I feel as though the ISPs are not being 100 percent truthful and are making a slightly unpleasant situation out to be far worse than it is.

1157
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:10,442
Scott: That is true.

1158
01:09:10,502 --> 01:09:14,844
Scott: But also the users are basically, you know, overreacting, saying ISPs are evil.

1159
01:09:14,885 --> 01:09:15,779
Scott: Everything you say is a lie.

1160
01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:17,138
Scott: Give me unlimited, which is unreasonable.

1161
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:28,020
Rym: At the same time, the ISPs have a lot of people, a lot of very powerful interests, have a vested interest in you not having cheap available bandwidth.

1162
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:28,782
Scott: That's true.

1163
01:09:28,801 --> 01:09:36,560
Rym: The media producers, the media distributors, the cell phone companies, all these people do not want you to have cheap bandwidth.

1164
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,120
Scott: You know who does want you to have cheap bandwidth?

1165
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:40,180
Scott: Actually, Google podcasters.

1166
01:09:41,144 --> 01:09:43,059
Scott: Yes, podcasters want you to have cheap bandwidth.

1167
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:44,558
Scott: How many people in Australia?

1168
01:09:44,779 --> 01:09:47,180
Scott: Because Australia only has one or two international links.

1169
01:09:47,563 --> 01:09:49,240
Scott: They have super limits on all their Internet.

1170
01:09:49,622 --> 01:09:50,899
Scott: They can't download the Ignites.

1171
01:09:51,443 --> 01:09:54,219
Scott: I mean, that's that's what it could be if they meter it the bad way.

1172
01:10:00,820 --> 01:10:02,780
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1173
01:10:03,020 --> 01:10:05,400
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music.

1174
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:17,280
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at www.frontroadcrew.com where you'll find show notes, links, our awesome forum, a link to our Frapper map and links to all the RSS feeds.

1175
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:23,559
Rym: We say feeds plural because GeekNights airs four nights a week covering four different brands of geekery.

1176
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:25,639
Rym: Mondays are science and technology.

1177
01:10:25,801 --> 01:10:28,240
Rym: Tuesdays we have video games, board games and RPGs.

1178
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:34,219
Rym: Wednesdays are anime, manga, comic nights and Thursdays are the catch alls for various rants and tomfoolery.

1179
01:10:34,740 --> 01:10:42,618
Scott: You can send us feedback by email to geeknights@frontroadcrew.com or you can send audio feedback via Odeo.

1180
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:46,240
Scott: Just click the link that says send me an Odeo on the right side of our website.

1181
01:10:46,660 --> 01:10:51,677
Rym: If you like what you hear, you can catch the last 100 episodes in iTunes or in your favorite podcatcher.

1182
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:55,080
Rym: For the complete archives, visit the website, which has everything.

1185
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:12,560
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1186
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:16,100
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
