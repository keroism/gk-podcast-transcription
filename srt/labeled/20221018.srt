1
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,289
Rym: It's Tuesday, October 18th, 2022.

2
00:00:09,289 --> 00:00:09,450
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,100
Scott: And I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:14,647
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,667 --> 00:00:17,120
Rym: Tonight we are talking about Moonbreaker.

6
00:00:19,022 --> 00:00:19,754
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:34,236
Rym: So, uh, we intended to experiment with, and then maybe start doing a Discord thing, because, you know, Discord recently announced and released a new feature, Discord Watch Together, where you can, like...

8
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,253
Scott: Well, it's Discord activities.

9
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:37,120
Scott: It's activities.

10
00:00:38,522 --> 00:00:41,040
Scott: And one of the activities is watch YouTube together.

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,865
Rym: So we figured we'd try it.

12
00:00:42,985 --> 00:00:50,280
Rym: So, uh, just before the show, Scott put on a video, happened to be a GeekNights panel, and, uh, feature just doesn't fucking work at all.

13
00:00:51,622 --> 00:00:53,440
Scott: Well, okay, so it works, but here's the problem.

14
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,980
Rym: Well, it'll work for normal people who don't care if they see ads and also don't have good technology.

15
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:58,782
Scott: Right.

16
00:00:58,802 --> 00:01:00,540
Scott: So I, first of all, I have YouTube Premium.

17
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:08,475
Scott: And so I launched, I picked a GeekNights video, I put it in Watch Together, and we went to go watch it, and I didn't see anything.

18
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:09,460
Scott: I saw a black screen.

19
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:20,025
Scott: And the reason I saw a black screen, even though it said the video was playing, is because I have so much ad block in my house, there was an ad playing, and the ad was getting blocked.

20
00:01:20,126 --> 00:01:23,900
Scott: And so I wasn't able to watch the YouTube video in Discord.

21
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,980
Scott: And then Rym saw the ad, I guess he has less ad block in his house.

22
00:01:28,181 --> 00:01:31,334
Rym: Yep, so I don't have that level of ad block in the house.

23
00:01:31,354 --> 00:01:36,600
Rym: Like, I don't use an IP hole or anything, I just, like, block ads in my browser because I use the browser for everything.

24
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,037
Scott: I have that also.

25
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:43,900
Rym: But I also pay for YouTube Premium, and it's my own fucking video that we were watching on my own account that I had uploaded.

26
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,286
Scott: Yeah, we both had YouTube Premium.

27
00:01:46,507 --> 00:01:50,400
Scott: All the viewers and the person who selected the video had YouTube Premium.

28
00:01:51,184 --> 00:01:52,620
Scott: And it was trying to show an ad.

29
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,506
Rym: Yep, and it showed me the ad.

30
00:01:54,587 --> 00:02:01,380
Rym: So I saw an ad from YouTube in a YouTube stream, despite the fact that I pay YouTube to not show me ads.

31
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:04,100
Rym: So we are not going to use this feature.

32
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,059
Scott: Discord's implementation was not good.

33
00:02:06,261 --> 00:02:12,300
Scott: So I was hoping that the activities, some of the activities are games, which have some potential to be fun, right?

34
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,019
Scott: Jackbox-ish kind of stuff.

35
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:20,840
Rym: I mean, if I were a product manager at Discord, I would be trying to make Jackbox-like experiences as hard and fast as possible.

36
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,864
Scott: Well, that's what they're doing.

37
00:02:21,885 --> 00:02:26,939
Scott: And what they've done is, I think you get the YouTube watch together, and you get one other one for free.

38
00:02:27,621 --> 00:02:32,540
Scott: But if you have Discord Nitro, which is not free, then you get all of them, basically.

39
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:40,779
Scott: And what they've added, a Discord Nitro mini plan, which is, I think the normal one is what, five bucks a month, ten bucks a month, something like that?

40
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,993
Rym: Yeah, I pay for it anyway.

41
00:02:43,033 --> 00:02:44,100
Rym: I use Discord pretty heavily.

42
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,880
Scott: There's Discord Nitro.

43
00:02:46,441 --> 00:02:51,080
Scott: So it's either ten bucks a month or a hundred bucks a year for regular old Nitro.

44
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:56,899
Scott: And the features you get if you pay for that are all the activities, right?

45
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,579
Scott: Fancier emojis, like animated ones, or make your own emojis.

46
00:03:04,031 --> 00:03:05,340
Scott: You can fancy up your profile.

47
00:03:06,402 --> 00:03:09,840
Scott: You get two server boosts every month, right?

48
00:03:10,082 --> 00:03:12,260
Scott: And you get a discount if you want to buy more boosts.

49
00:03:13,442 --> 00:03:14,960
Scott: You get some profile badges.

50
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,620
Scott: You can upload, the big one for me is you can upload larger files, right?

51
00:03:21,762 --> 00:03:25,540
Scott: Just the iPhone, the default resolution of photos I take with the iPhone.

52
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:31,940
Rym: I mean, that's one of the reasons I pay for the big Discord, is that I upload full-on videos from like Overwatch games to Discord just fine.

53
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,560
Scott: Yeah, it's like I'll take a photo with my iPhone and try to upload a Discord channel.

54
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:38,660
Scott: And if you don't pay, it's like your photo's too big, right?

55
00:03:39,404 --> 00:03:46,980
Scott: And then the last one is that if you go to a channel, and you try to stream video or webcam, it's not HD, right?

56
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,979
Scott: Unless the server is boosted so much that they're all HD.

57
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,020
Scott: So, and you can use emojis from one server in another server.

58
00:03:55,782 --> 00:03:58,520
Rym: Oh my god, so the watch together is even worse.

59
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,980
Rym: It has a whole bunch of arbitrary restrictions.

60
00:04:01,381 --> 00:04:02,920
Rym: It only works in the desktop app.

61
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:06,160
Rym: No other apps, probably because of licensing agreements with YouTube.

62
00:04:08,261 --> 00:04:18,079
Rym: And it is limited to 180 minutes and then you're not allowed to watch anything else and it kicks everybody out and you have a cooldown before you're allowed to use it again.

63
00:04:19,281 --> 00:04:21,298
Scott: Wow, alright, that's worse, that's even worse, yeah.

64
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,558
Rym: The same time it applies no matter what server or voice chat you're in.

65
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:31,399
Rym: And if you're watching by yourself, like no one joins your group, it cuts you off after 30 minutes.

66
00:04:32,983 --> 00:04:33,360
Scott: Okay.

67
00:04:33,461 --> 00:04:41,000
Rym: I feel like a lot of this, the ads and everything, are all because of YouTube's monetization and embedding rules, is my guess.

68
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:53,979
Scott: So the other thing they've done is along with these new activities, the YouTube one which is the primary one, they've added this Nitro Basic plan, which is much cheaper, it's only $3 a month, which is a lot cheaper, right?

69
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,240
Scott: And what you get for this is you get the emoji features, right?

70
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,480
Scott: That I discussed.

71
00:05:00,163 --> 00:05:06,920
Scott: You can upload bigger files but only up to 50 megs, not 100, but still much more than the default, right?

72
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,720
Scott: That'll probably get you and that's probably enough to upload photos from your iPhone without trouble, right?

73
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:25,500
Scott: You get the badge profile and on your whatever, badge on the profile and you get the custom video background thing when you're in a video chat, right?

74
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,039
Scott: Background's behind your head, right?

75
00:05:27,681 --> 00:05:29,239
Scott: Which you also get with the regular Nitro.

76
00:05:31,071 --> 00:05:32,460
Scott: You don't get any other Nitro feature.

77
00:05:33,385 --> 00:05:35,079
Scott: You just get those features.

78
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:55,063
Scott: So I guess they figure, they must have calculated, that there are people who want just those features, but $10 is too much, but $3 will get them to pay, they'll pay the $3, especially if they don't have a lot of money, and they'll get money out of people who would otherwise pay $0.

79
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,120
Rym: It's not a bad strategy.

80
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:12,960
Rym: Plus in general, Discord generally makes good features and makes good decisions, which is why the weird ad situation with the watch together is interesting and that's why I'm pretty sure the problem is YouTube's rules as opposed to Discord knowing that that sucks.

81
00:06:14,021 --> 00:06:22,360
Scott: Yeah, I guess the thing is we were trying to end around the fact that the Discord stages don't allow video in them.

82
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:27,499
Rym: Yeah, because if they did, we would absolutely stream gig nights into our own Discord, like why not?

83
00:06:29,384 --> 00:06:33,200
Scott: I figured, well, what if we use the YouTube watch together, we could sort of end around, right?

84
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,940
Scott: We could just watch together the stream of ourself, right?

85
00:06:38,724 --> 00:06:40,839
Scott: But I guess that won't work.

86
00:06:41,843 --> 00:06:42,749
Rym: I guess I'll go back to.

87
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:49,920
Rym: if I want to watch a YouTube together, I will just stream my entire screen via OBS to Discord to all of my friends.

88
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:59,699
Rym: So in some gaming news, I have been playing a ton of Overwatch 2 and I actually have a lot I can say and share about it.

89
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:10,300
Rym: So there's a lot going on here because Overwatch 2 is basically just like an iterative advancement of Overwatch 1, like minor ruleset changes, the graphics look different.

90
00:07:11,341 --> 00:07:13,840
Scott: And they've also, Overwatch 1 no longer exists, right?

91
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,580
Scott: They just replaced it with Overwatch 2, so Overwatch 2 is the only Overwatch.

92
00:07:18,661 --> 00:07:22,980
Scott: No one can ever play Overwatch again, it is not preserved in history.

93
00:07:23,603 --> 00:07:26,537
Rym: In the same way that pretty much all multiplayer games go these days.

94
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:28,519
Rym: It's still not good.

95
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:35,860
Rym: So Overwatch 2 would just be like an update, like the continuance of Overwatch.

96
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:42,140
Rym: I would have said it's basically the same as when Counter-Strike went to Counter-Strike Source and Counter-Strike GO.

97
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,099
Scott: Well, it's not a new engine, is it?

98
00:07:45,603 --> 00:07:50,439
Rym: It's not a new engine, but it does graphically look different and they have radically changed the number of elements of how the game works.

99
00:07:51,641 --> 00:08:08,100
Rym: But, they simultaneously also made the move to making Overwatch a free-to-play game, which has introduced a whole level of Fortnite evil monetization hellworld nonsense that was previously not in Overwatch.

100
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:14,500
Rym: Because remember, Overwatch previously was a game you paid money for and you got all of Overwatch, it just worked.

101
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:26,280
Rym: Now it's got battle passes and all that same kind of crap that Fortnite has, which increasingly seems to be the only way to monetize an online game enough to continue its existence.

102
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,159
Scott: I mean, the vast majority of players are gonna shell out a bunch of money, especially if they're not already playing.

103
00:08:35,421 --> 00:08:38,789
Scott: It's like, "Hey, here's a game you might enjoy.

104
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:41,035
Scott: You can't even play it at all until you pay

105
00:08:41,035 --> 00:08:43,403
Scott: $60.".

106
00:08:43,403 --> 00:08:47,656
Scott: Even if people paid $60, it'd be like, "Here's $60.

107
00:08:47,656 --> 00:08:48,740
Scott: That's the end of the income.

108
00:08:49,242 --> 00:08:52,037
Scott: And now, why would you keep maintaining this game when no one else--".

109
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,080
Scott: It's like you're not gaining more players.

110
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,064
Scott: Now,

111
00:08:55,225 --> 00:09:01,699
Rym: I would definitely, if there was a game I cared about, like I used to back in the day when I would pay for things because these other models didn't exist,

112
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:02,842
Scott: paying

113
00:09:02,882 --> 00:09:08,320
Rym: a monthly fee to have access to a significant online game does make sense if the game--

114
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,500
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I'm paying a monthly fee for Virtual Bicycle World.

115
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:14,520
Scott: -Yeah, but-- -Which is basically a video game.

116
00:09:15,061 --> 00:09:17,560
Rym: In video games, you can't make enough money doing that.

117
00:09:17,961 --> 00:09:20,320
Rym: There's basically no way to make money in video games unless you're evil.

118
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:33,020
Rym: So basically, most of the weird problems and the complaints and the interesting stuff that's happening around Overwatch 2 right now is directly and solely caused by the fact that it's also now free to play.

119
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:43,760
Rym: So in Overwatch 1, there were shitheads who would get banned pretty frequently, not hard to get banned from online games, and they were pretty aggressive about banning toxic people.

120
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:44,899
Rym: Like, it worked really well.

121
00:09:45,581 --> 00:09:51,459
Rym: I'd say a high percentage of the people I reported, I got a notification that they were banned, like, pretty much within a couple of days.

122
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:59,420
Rym: So with Overwatch, when someone got banned, they had to buy the game again if they wanted to keep playing.

123
00:09:59,881 --> 00:10:06,640
Rym: So there was a monetary cost to being a piece of shit in the game, which made a relatively stable ecosystem.

124
00:10:07,263 --> 00:10:10,280
Rym: But if a game goes free to play, how do you handle that?

125
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:16,278
Rym: If a game is free, then people can just keep making an infinite number of free accounts to play the game.

126
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:21,960
Rym: So Overwatch tried a few ways, or Blizzard tried a few ways to get around this.

127
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:34,860
Rym: First, they tried to say, for the new Overwatch 2, you actually have to associate a real phone number with your Blizzard account to be able to play Overwatch 2.

128
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,480
Scott: Overwatch will steal someone's phone number, right?

129
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,740
Scott: Oh yeah, but even then-- Just open up the contacts on your phone and find a phone number and type it in.

130
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,700
Rym: Yeah, but then you have to verify with the texting.

131
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,219
Rym: Like, it basically becomes your two-factor.

132
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:49,180
Rym: So you have to prove it's your phone number, and they will ban you based on your phone number.

133
00:10:49,800 --> 00:11:01,840
Rym: So they did this, and then a whole other set of stories came out because now a ton of people who wanted to play Overwatch couldn't because they didn't have legitimate phone numbers.

134
00:11:02,222 --> 00:11:07,800
Rym: The only phone they have is the kinds of phone numbers-- Yeah, there's some kid who doesn't have a phone.

135
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:21,440
Rym: Yeah, but the kids who don't have phones and people who can't afford phones all have phone numbers from these throwaway, garbage-tier sites that are also used by scammers and trolls and criminals.

136
00:11:22,301 --> 00:11:29,859
Rym: So if you let those phone numbers be used, the whole system's worthless because the toxic kid can get a hundred new phone numbers if they need to.

137
00:11:30,402 --> 00:11:39,240
Rym: But when they block those services, suddenly a huge number of people who would otherwise play Overwatch 2 now can't because they do not have a phone.

138
00:11:40,762 --> 00:11:45,119
Rym: So they walk that back a little bit, and they're still trying to sort out what to do, but it's even worse.

139
00:11:46,142 --> 00:11:54,699
Rym: If you have not played Overwatch before and you start playing Overwatch 2 brand new from nothing, they actually-- On one hand, they did something good.

140
00:11:55,141 --> 00:12:01,680
Rym: You can't play competitive until you win 50 games in the casual mode, which is a high number of games.

141
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:08,120
Scott: All right, so if you get banned and you make a new account for free, you have to play 50 casual games before you can interfere and troll some competitive games.

142
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,279
Scott: Not just play games.

143
00:12:10,043 --> 00:12:16,980
Scott: And if you're a piece of shit, how are you going to win 50 casual games without getting banned again for being a piece of shit?

144
00:12:17,562 --> 00:12:18,500
Scott: And that actually makes sense.

145
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:22,000
Scott: That should insulate the competitive play from shitty people.

146
00:12:22,261 --> 00:12:33,280
Rym: Yep, because the competitive play of any free-to-play game is very easily ruined by the nature of free-to-play and the fact that if a game is free-- They care a lot less if casual play gets ruined.

147
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,220
Rym: Exactly, because casual play is casual play.

148
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,720
Rym: Like, just go in there and shoot people and stop shooting people when you're bored.

149
00:12:39,484 --> 00:12:40,700
Rym: Whatever, I never play casual.

150
00:12:41,943 --> 00:12:44,300
Scott: Well, didn't you have to win 50 games, though?

151
00:12:45,142 --> 00:12:47,880
Rym: No, because you don't have to win 50 games.

152
00:12:48,302 --> 00:12:54,139
Rym: One, if you had an Overwatch 1 account that was active when they made the switch to 2, if you were already playing, you're already in.

153
00:12:55,002 --> 00:12:55,880
Rym: And you kept all your stuff.

154
00:12:56,682 --> 00:12:59,060
Rym: Or you can buy a pack for, like, 20 bucks.

155
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:05,131
Rym: I don't know how often they'll have these packs, but it's a lot like Fortnite, and the pack is basically a "Get

156
00:13:05,233 --> 00:13:05,640
Rym: everything!"

157
00:13:06,023 --> 00:13:08,900
Rym: And it's just like you owned Overwatch 1.

158
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:14,360
Rym: You can "unlock" all the stuff almost immediately and being competitive really quickly.

159
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:19,339
Rym: So pay 20 bucks or win 50 games seems to be the way they're going.

160
00:13:20,921 --> 00:13:31,440
Rym: In terms of player unlocking, because this is a game that has characters, normal players, people like me, people who have played the game, just have every character.

161
00:13:32,181 --> 00:13:40,140
Rym: If you don't pay for a battle pass, you still get every character, but you have to win enough games to unlock them, and it's a lot of games.

162
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,259
Rym: You'll very slowly unlock characters.

163
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,900
Scott: Or is it like League of Legends where it rotates who's available?

164
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:46,889
Rym: There's no rotation.

165
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,020
Rym: That's not a thing in Overwatch.

166
00:13:49,182 --> 00:13:53,040
Scott: So there's a few characters that everyone always has no matter what.

167
00:13:54,840 --> 00:14:08,719
Rym: So a new player who does not pay any money gets a tiny selection of characters, not so much as part of a grindy experience, or an unlocking experience, or even to try to get those people to pay money.

168
00:14:09,322 --> 00:14:17,180
Rym: The idea seems to be that it's a difficult, complex, competitive game, and there still are aiming that part of the game at people who want to play seriously.

169
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:30,080
Rym: And it seems like, and I've read a bunch of interviews where they said this pretty much openly, it is a better on-ramp to people learning how to play the game enough to hit this baseline level before you even let them into competitive.

170
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:37,780
Rym: So all the casual players who are brand new are playing in a very limited, it's almost like the easy mode of a game like Agricola before you play the real mode.

171
00:14:38,121 --> 00:14:42,000
Scott: Alright, so if you started playing today, how many characters would you have?

172
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,382
Rym: No idea.

173
00:14:42,442 --> 00:14:43,647
Rym: Some small set.

174
00:14:43,707 --> 00:14:46,680
Rym: You get a limited set of characters of each type, and you'll unlock all of them.

175
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,620
Scott: Now how many are there total?

176
00:14:48,824 --> 00:14:49,207
Rym: Uh, 10, 20, 20-ish?

177
00:14:49,227 --> 00:14:49,629
Rym: 20-something?

178
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,182
Scott: 20-ish?

179
00:14:52,222 --> 00:14:59,700
Scott: Okay, so if you wanted to unlock all of them from, you just started today, how much money would you have to spend if you did it only with money?

180
00:15:00,163 --> 00:15:00,859
Rym: I think 20 bucks.

181
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:03,411
Scott: 20 bucks gets you all the characters?

182
00:15:03,431 --> 00:15:04,780
Scott: Just all of them unlocked immediately?

183
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,110
Rym: All of them except one, the brand new character.

184
00:15:07,151 --> 00:15:14,500
Rym: they just added for Overwatch 2, that if you have a battle pass, you will get it when you win like five games.

185
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:20,999
Scott: So you have to spend 20 bucks and then win, the only thing, you can't spend money to get that last character, you just have to win five games?

186
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:25,000
Rym: Well, and you have to spend money on the battle pass, which is separate from the pack I mentioned.

187
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,920
Scott: Like I said, they're doing the same- Oh, the battle pass is separate from the pack.

188
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,080
Rym: Yeah, they're doing the same thing that Fortnite and every other game does.

189
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:39,080
Scott: They have this obfuscated system with a bunch of different- So you end up with Overwatch 1 is 20 bucks and then the battle pass is how much?

190
00:15:39,841 --> 00:15:42,820
Rym: I don't actually know because I refuse to buy battle passes in games.

191
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,420
Scott: So you don't have the one extra character?

192
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,700
Rym: No, I actually do not have the one extra character.

193
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,340
Rym: Now, I'm gonna get that character real quick because I play the game competitively and seriously.

194
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,060
Scott: So you can't just grind it out of nothing?

195
00:15:53,340 --> 00:16:04,720
Rym: Yep, I can just grind it out of nothing and I can play the character in casual, I can play the character in the practice rooms, I can play the character in custom games, I only can't play the character in ranked competitive.

196
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:09,998
Scott: Oh, so even if you started today, you could use every character just not competitively?

197
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,479
Rym: In all the side modes, it looks like it, yeah.

198
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:19,660
Scott: Okay, so it's only in the competitive mode that you can't use every character to pay money?

199
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:28,120
Rym: Yeah, but to back up a little bit, all of this combined, the reason it sounds confusing is that it is confusing.

200
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,779
Scott: It is confusing to me- -to spend wrong amounts of money.

201
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:37,261
Rym: Yep, I have played Overwatch since the beta of Overwatch 1.

202
00:16:37,261 --> 00:16:39,839
Scott: I have played Overwatch since the dawn of Overwatch.

203
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,732
Scott: An honest and open and clear casino doesn't make as much money as one.

204
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,960
Scott: that's a maze with all kinds of games with confusing rules.

205
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:52,760
Rym: Because an honest and open casino, you walk in, they would just like flash some lights in you and then steal your wallet and then kick you out with some booze.

206
00:16:54,822 --> 00:16:56,300
Rym: It would be a lot more efficient.

207
00:16:57,041 --> 00:17:09,319
Scott: But basically, it's in the same pay-to-win realm as League of Legends where it's debatable whether it's pay-to-win because not everyone is on a completely even footing.

208
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,720
Scott: It doesn't cost that much money to get all the competitive things.

209
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:16,592
Scott: It's characters, it's not like boosts, right?

210
00:17:16,893 --> 00:17:18,440
Scott: Plus one damage costs a dollar.

211
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:24,676
Rym: There's no such thing as that because there's a whole other pile of nonsense with the battle passes and everything that I didn't talk about.

212
00:17:24,696 --> 00:17:25,720
Rym: that's even more confusing.

213
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:29,700
Rym: But it's 100% cosmetic so it literally doesn't exist as far as I'm concerned.

214
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:37,336
Scott: But it's basically the same as that gray area that Netrunner was in where it's like, "Yeah, all the cards are available to everyone.

215
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:38,259
Scott: There's no collectible

216
00:17:38,299 --> 00:17:38,700
Scott: bullshit.".

217
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:42,539
Scott: But some people went out and bought all the cards and some people didn't.

218
00:17:43,301 --> 00:17:56,500
Rym: And what sucks is that weird edge case like that liminal zone between pay-to-win and just a game is blurred because it's a free-to-play game.

219
00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:02,980
Rym: If this was not a free-to-play game and they used the same model they used in Overwatch 1, then none of this would exist.

220
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:12,220
Rym: This entire complex ecosystem of nonsense is solely there to obfuscate how they make money to allow the game to be free-to-play.

221
00:18:13,641 --> 00:18:24,480
Rym: What sucks, because if it weren't for that capitalist pressure, the idea of the game is free for anyone to play and open so that people can try the game out and decide if they like it.

222
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:33,500
Rym: It's almost like having a minor league or a casual league that draws people in so that you can have people ascending to the serious competitive play.

223
00:18:33,681 --> 00:18:39,540
Scott: I think we talked about this before when Richard Garfield wrote this article about tournaments being better than ladders.

224
00:18:40,242 --> 00:18:42,129
Scott: And I completely 100% agree.

225
00:18:42,269 --> 00:18:45,220
Scott: and no game that I know of has done this yet.

226
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:45,581
Scott: It's like.

227
00:18:45,621 --> 00:18:52,280
Scott: all you gotta do is make a game where this free-to-play, whatever, nobody cares about that.

228
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,767
Scott: You can do whatever you want.

229
00:18:53,887 --> 00:18:54,812
Scott: It's not competitive.

230
00:18:54,852 --> 00:18:55,676
Scott: It's not serious.

231
00:18:55,757 --> 00:18:56,460
Scott: So it doesn't matter.

232
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,443
Scott: Make it gambling.

233
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,469
Scott: It doesn't matter.

234
00:18:59,509 --> 00:19:03,300
Scott: Do whatever the hell you need to do to make money in the non-competitive area of the game.

235
00:19:04,301 --> 00:19:07,388
Scott: All you need to do is say, "This is the competitive area of the game.

236
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:11,237
Scott: The only competitive play are organized

237
00:19:11,537 --> 00:19:12,039
Scott: tournaments.".

238
00:19:12,841 --> 00:19:16,551
Scott: Just like when you play Magic at the local game store, it's a tournament.

239
00:19:16,571 --> 00:19:19,760
Scott: You pay an entry fee to get into the tournament.

240
00:19:20,741 --> 00:19:22,887
Scott: You gotta sit there and play all the matches.

241
00:19:22,948 --> 00:19:23,750
Scott: It might be Swiss.

242
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:24,853
Scott: It might be elimination.

243
00:19:25,234 --> 00:19:27,100
Scott: Whatever it is, you gotta sit there.

244
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,231
Scott: If you don't play all the matches, you forfeit.

245
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,136
Scott: You're out of the tournament.

246
00:19:30,478 --> 00:19:30,880
Scott: You lose.

247
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,264
Rym: Now see, I take it different.

248
00:19:33,304 --> 00:19:41,060
Rym: Personally, I just don't want to even play games with people who need that kind of structure to be able to not just be pieces of shit in the game.

249
00:19:41,321 --> 00:19:43,767
Scott: No, this isn't about people being pieces of shit.

250
00:19:44,188 --> 00:19:47,797
Scott: It's about creating a proper competitive structure.

251
00:19:50,280 --> 00:20:02,220
Scott: It's like, the tournaments that anyone can play in at any time, you win those, and by winning those, now you can go to the next level of tournaments.

252
00:20:03,922 --> 00:20:12,640
Rym: But the only reason to have those kinds of ladders in these kinds of games, really, is just so the matchmaking makes sense so you're not playing against people who are...

253
00:20:12,941 --> 00:20:14,446
Scott: No, you don't need any matchmaking.

254
00:20:14,507 --> 00:20:15,069
Scott: It's a tournament.

255
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:18,220
Scott: When you go to the local store to play Magic, it's not fucking matchmaking.

256
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,424
Rym: So instead of, "Well, I'm home from work.

257
00:20:20,464 --> 00:20:21,386
Rym: I'll play Overwatch for an

258
00:20:21,406 --> 00:20:21,627
Rym: hour."

259
00:20:21,707 --> 00:20:26,218
Rym: It's, "Well, time to go see what tournaments are happening at 4 o'clock on

260
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:26,860
Rym: Thursday.".

261
00:20:27,241 --> 00:20:28,285
Scott: No, there's no.

262
00:20:28,466 --> 00:20:29,349
Scott: "see what tournaments are

263
00:20:29,369 --> 00:20:29,690
Scott: happening.".

264
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:32,300
Scott: There's so many players, you just say, "Join tournament," and you join one.

265
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,729
Rym: Yeah, what if I only have 30 minutes to play?

266
00:20:35,473 --> 00:20:36,580
Rym: What if I only have 20 minutes to play?

267
00:20:36,821 --> 00:20:39,760
Scott: Then you're not ready for competitive... That's not a competitive thing.

268
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:40,729
Scott: But Scott, why?

269
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:40,811
Rym: Why?

270
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,970
Scott: You're gonna sit down and compete, right?

271
00:20:44,091 --> 00:20:46,380
Scott: This is the time for playing series.

272
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:57,399
Rym: I agree with aspects of what Richard Garfield said, but I absolutely disagree with whatever nonsense you're on about because the whole point of competitive in a game like Overwatch, as opposed to casual, is just everyone here is trying their best to win.

273
00:20:59,223 --> 00:21:00,840
Scott: That's just casual play, right?

274
00:21:01,681 --> 00:21:05,380
Rym: Have you played an online FPS in the last five years, Scott?

275
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:12,797
Rym: If you play in casual, what I find is that in every game, the unranked mode, most of the players are not even trying to win at all.

276
00:21:12,858 --> 00:21:13,780
Rym: They're just fucking around.

277
00:21:15,885 --> 00:21:19,820
Scott: Listen, if you don't want to play in a tournament, then you're not playing competitively.

278
00:21:20,521 --> 00:21:23,189
Rym: You're just playing against people.

279
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:26,520
Scott: That's going to the game store and playing against whoever happens to be sitting there.

280
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:40,660
Rym: But Scott, that's absolutely 100% not true because if I go to Overwatch and I click competitive, every single match, 100% of the time, everyone in there is trying super hard to win and taking the game super seriously.

281
00:21:41,662 --> 00:21:44,260
Scott: Yeah, but that's because you're playing on some weird ladder nonsense.

282
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,784
Scott: No, what do you mean weird ladder nonsense?

283
00:21:45,885 --> 00:21:50,320
Rym: All competitive means is we matchmake you based on some math.

284
00:21:51,442 --> 00:21:52,553
Scott: That math is a ladder.

285
00:21:52,633 --> 00:21:53,300
Scott: It's not a tournament.

286
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:59,200
Rym: Yeah, and that ladder is solely there to make sure you are playing against people of your same relative skill.

287
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:06,020
Scott: Right, but the ladders do not facilitate a greater overall competitive structure.

288
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:09,785
Rym: But what is your goal of that greater overall competitive structure?

289
00:22:09,825 --> 00:22:19,500
Rym: Because the Overwatch structure actually very clearly and directly feeds people into the serious competitive, like the tournament scene, the money scene, the professional play.

290
00:22:20,461 --> 00:22:27,020
Rym: Through this, the people who get to diamond tier and ascend to the three at the top, those are the people who get pulled up into the professional teams.

291
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:33,240
Scott: Yeah, sure, but doing it that way is not as good as doing it the tournament way.

292
00:22:33,321 --> 00:22:34,210
Rym: How is it not as good?

293
00:22:34,594 --> 00:22:35,100
Rym: Works fine.

294
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,968
Scott: Look at every single non-esport.

295
00:22:40,508 --> 00:22:47,380
Scott: Even tennis where they have a world ranking, which could be considered a ladder, you only get points for the world ranking by playing at tournaments.

296
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:51,606
Scott: There are no just play games to get points.

297
00:22:51,626 --> 00:22:52,348
Scott: That doesn't exist.

298
00:22:53,009 --> 00:22:59,180
Scott: You enter competitive tournament events and those events are the things that matter for your overall ranking.

299
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,023
Rym: You just sound like a cranky old man.

300
00:23:00,043 --> 00:23:03,233
Scott: You just play whatever the hell you want and go up and down.

301
00:23:03,293 --> 00:23:05,480
Rym: You want weird things that nobody else wants.

302
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:14,556
Scott: No, I think this is, and then the other thing is that when you have these tournaments as being the only competitive mode of play, there's entry fees and prizes.

303
00:23:14,576 --> 00:23:15,478
Scott: You can have prizes, right?

304
00:23:15,498 --> 00:23:16,480
Scott: Because there's entry fees.

305
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:23,157
Rym: Yeah, that also exists, but that's separate because all this is for is matchmaking and they change that too.

306
00:23:23,217 --> 00:23:24,360
Rym: Instead of showing people the number.

307
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,319
Scott: And do tournaments you don't need matchmaking?

308
00:23:28,743 --> 00:23:29,668
Rym: Actually, yes you do.

309
00:23:29,729 --> 00:23:31,720
Rym: The matchmaking just happens before the tournament starts.

310
00:23:31,801 --> 00:23:34,480
Scott: When you go to the local store to play a Warhammer tournament, is there matchmaking?

311
00:23:36,261 --> 00:23:38,087
Rym: If you're talking about that shit tier level, then no.

312
00:23:38,107 --> 00:23:41,900
Rym: You're probably going to play with people who are radically outside of each other's skill sets.

313
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:51,220
Scott: Right, but if you use a Swiss structure, it's like yeah, the first couple rounds you might get randomly paired against someone who sucks, but then the rest of the tournament is automatically matchmade.

314
00:23:51,240 --> 00:24:07,940
Rym: But in an online game, as opposed to a physical game where you actually have to go somewhere and schedule things with a large player base, instead the laddering system of matchmaking just ensures that no matter what, you are always playing every single game with people who are around your ability level.

315
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:14,954
Rym: No exceptions, which is way more fun than a random match where, "Well, now I'm playing against someone who literally can't play.

316
00:24:14,974 --> 00:24:16,337
Rym: This is going to be really sad for ten

317
00:24:16,378 --> 00:24:16,618
Rym: minutes.".

318
00:24:18,129 --> 00:24:18,939
Scott: I do not agree.

319
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:22,137
Rym: I mean, you don't play games online, really, so...

320
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,380
Scott: Right, because they're all like these ladders.

321
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,408
Scott: Well, what do you mean?

322
00:24:26,449 --> 00:24:27,076
Scott: What about the ladder?

323
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,464
Rym: Uh, okay.

324
00:24:29,484 --> 00:24:31,150
Rym: I mean, you don't want to play any of the other games.

325
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:33,980
Rym: You didn't play Overwatch 1, which was up your alley when it wasn't free-to-play.

326
00:24:34,822 --> 00:24:36,199
Scott: It's not a game I want to play.

327
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:37,758
Rym: You want to go play Counter-Strike right now?

328
00:24:39,322 --> 00:24:41,060
Rym: No, that's not a game I want to play either.

329
00:24:43,465 --> 00:24:44,440
Rym: You didn't play Netrunner.

330
00:24:45,221 --> 00:24:54,638
Rym: Uh, because that was an in-person physical game that required me to pick a specific time to play, as opposed to I can just see who's online in my friend group, hit a button, and we're instantly playing a game 24/7, anytime.

331
00:24:56,547 --> 00:24:57,699
Scott: But it was a much better game.

332
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:58,825
Scott: By like 10,000-fold.

333
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,404
Rym: I mean, you say that.

334
00:25:01,605 --> 00:25:04,076
Rym: I honestly didn't enjoy Netrunner that much.

335
00:25:04,117 --> 00:25:04,860
Rym: There's a reason I did not.

336
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,720
Scott: You played it for five minutes.

337
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,118
Rym: Yeah, and I didn't find it that fun.

338
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,460
Scott: Yeah, okay.

339
00:25:09,123 --> 00:25:10,579
Rym: Kind of like the game we're going to review today.

340
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,619
Rym: So, you got any news?

341
00:25:12,883 --> 00:25:13,487
Scott: Uh, there isn't.

342
00:25:13,528 --> 00:25:15,180
Scott: Well, okay, so what was the news?

343
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,700
Rym: You were going to talk about that Gundam game.

344
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,299
Scott: Oh, yeah, the awful Gundam game.

345
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,480
Rym: That I assume you're not going to play, because it's not.

346
00:25:21,121 --> 00:25:21,663
Scott: It was free.

347
00:25:21,724 --> 00:25:24,779
Scott: I played it for 10 minutes, and then I saw what it was, you know.

348
00:25:25,261 --> 00:25:26,459
Scott: So, it's a Gundam game.

349
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:32,720
Rym: Because I already see, I've got to say, I have it on the screen, I just went to the Steam store, and I see Gundam game.

350
00:25:33,162 --> 00:25:34,579
Rym: All reviews, mixed.

351
00:25:34,901 --> 00:25:38,929
Rym: All right, I scroll down a tiny bit, and it says, "Items available for this game.

352
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:39,831
Rym: Coins for $10.

353
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:40,432
Rym: More coins for $50.

354
00:25:40,432 --> 00:25:41,094
Rym: More coins for

355
00:25:41,094 --> 00:25:44,341
Rym: $100.".

356
00:25:44,341 --> 00:25:51,740
Rym: The graphics that you can't see, that I'm showing the listener, I know exactly what this game is, and there's no way I'm ever going to play it.

357
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,340
Scott: No, I played it one time, and that's it.

358
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:58,874
Scott: So, the Gundam game, Gundam Evolution, is a free-to-play FPS, right?

359
00:25:58,934 --> 00:25:59,636
Scott: It's on Steam.

360
00:25:59,737 --> 00:26:00,619
Scott: You can play it right now.

361
00:26:01,562 --> 00:26:04,150
Scott: And, it's basically Overwatch, right?

362
00:26:04,311 --> 00:26:07,260
Scott: Only, all the character models are Gundam robots.

363
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,933
Rym: I question your, "It's just

364
00:26:10,054 --> 00:26:10,536
Rym: Overwatch.".

365
00:26:10,637 --> 00:26:11,442
Rym: I don't think you know- It is.

366
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:13,640
Scott: Everyone says it's basically just Overwatch, but a really shitty one.

367
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,719
Rym: Yeah, but I don't think you know what Overwatch is even like.

368
00:26:16,881 --> 00:26:18,165
Scott: You have a team of, you know, what?

369
00:26:18,225 --> 00:26:19,208
Scott: Five, six people.

370
00:26:19,228 --> 00:26:20,512
Scott: You have these different roles.

371
00:26:20,532 --> 00:26:23,020
Scott: You got your support guys, your tank guys, right?

372
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:26,417
Scott: You go try to, you know, different objectives on the map, right?

373
00:26:26,438 --> 00:26:26,880
Rym: It's bullshit.

374
00:26:27,001 --> 00:26:31,265
Scott: That's extremely facile, I mean- It's the same FPS nonsense, right?

375
00:26:31,345 --> 00:26:38,700
Scott: Anyway, so, first of all, as a game, it's not even good at the game it is, right?

376
00:26:40,341 --> 00:26:46,960
Scott: Even if this game was not free-to-play, pay-to-win, or anything like that, it's just not a good game.

377
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,744
Scott: The controls don't feel great.

378
00:26:50,088 --> 00:26:52,655
Scott: You know, you just die really quickly.

379
00:26:53,116 --> 00:26:54,520
Scott: The abilities are not fun.

380
00:26:55,001 --> 00:26:57,759
Scott: The maps are actually the worst part of this game.

381
00:26:58,301 --> 00:27:00,407
Rym: Ooh, 'cause that's actually one thing.

382
00:27:00,949 --> 00:27:05,020
Rym: Overwatch has some of the best FPS maps I have ever seen.

383
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:12,880
Scott: These maps in this game, right, they look like, they're like the, if you were getting like some game dev tutorial, like how to make an FPS.

384
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:18,040
Scott: Like, these are like just the most generic maps, like a bunch of rocks and a building.

385
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:22,229
Scott: It's like, you know, they're so boring, these maps.

386
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:23,292
Scott: None of them are exciting.

387
00:27:23,312 --> 00:27:26,320
Scott: They didn't make Space Colony the map, right?

388
00:27:26,681 --> 00:27:32,133
Scott: They didn't make outer space or on the surface of a spaceship the map or anything cool Gundam-like.

389
00:27:32,213 --> 00:27:35,260
Scott: It's just random places, you know, whatever.

390
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,759
Rym: They look like Halo maps.

391
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,723
Scott: They're not, they're not, they're really boring.

392
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:47,700
Scott: The other thing is that the game, even if it's good or not, does not, at least to me, feel Gundam-y, right?

393
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:54,220
Scott: It's like, yeah, your characters are Gundams and some of their special moves are Gundam special moves, right?

394
00:27:54,701 --> 00:28:02,400
Scott: But, you know, like you bring up the shield and whatnot, but it doesn't feel like the way it looks when you watch a Gundam anime.

395
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:08,040
Scott: If you watch a Gundam anime, Gundams are A) fast, B) they're jumping and flying all over the place.

396
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:11,038
Rym: It's got to be some combination of virtual on types gameplay.

397
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,080
Scott: Yeah, virtual on is more of a Gundam game than this.

398
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:18,919
Rym: But there's also got to be people's faces popping up on the screen yelling at me the entire time.

399
00:28:19,503 --> 00:28:19,926
Scott: Exactly.

400
00:28:20,066 --> 00:28:22,160
Scott: Gundams have all sorts of like...

401
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:27,860
Rym: You know, I got to tell you, I got to play the arcade Gundam game and other people in the pod.

402
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:30,060
Rym: I mean, I couldn't speak Japanese, so it was kind of a problem.

403
00:28:30,381 --> 00:28:38,800
Rym: But other people could chat with you and their face would pop up from a camera in the other pod in your screen when they tried to communicate with you on the team.

404
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,138
Scott: Yeah, this game doesn't do any of that.

405
00:28:41,441 --> 00:28:45,340
Scott: Gundam game, you know, Gundam when you watch an anime is like a, you know, it's an Itano circus.

406
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,164
Scott: There's a bullet hell.

407
00:28:46,184 --> 00:28:48,360
Scott: There's just shit flying all over the place, right?

408
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,034
Scott: Meanwhile, when you play this game, you bring out like the, you know, the beam rifle.

409
00:28:52,074 --> 00:28:52,556
Scott: It's like pew, pew.

410
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,339
Scott: It's not pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

411
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,600
Scott: You know, I expect to be shooting lasers all over the fucking place, right?

412
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:03,040
Scott: That all do minimal damage and you need lots and lots of hits to actually hurt anybody.

413
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,203
Scott: There wasn't a beat.

414
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:07,700
Scott: There you have a beam saver or the machine guns in the Gundam's head or anything.

415
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:13,217
Scott: It's like, you know, it doesn't feel Gundam-y other than having some character models.

416
00:29:13,297 --> 00:29:14,300
Scott: So that was a disappointment.

417
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,080
Rym: Oh, wow.

418
00:29:15,161 --> 00:29:25,157
Rym: Even the people who disagree with you and like the gameplay, all the reviews from the people who like it for gameplay are still saying, "Oh, the payment scheme is so toxic.

419
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:26,038
Rym: This game is dead.

420
00:29:26,118 --> 00:29:26,579
Rym: COA.".

421
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:27,582
Scott: Correct.

422
00:29:27,642 --> 00:29:31,920
Scott: So this game also, this, you know, in terms of pay to win, right?

423
00:29:32,301 --> 00:29:41,820
Scott: Again, just like Overwatch, there's no, like, you can't pay for like a shield or armor or it's all, you know, cosmetic stuff, but there are some Gundams you have to unlock.

424
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:46,274
Scott: And to unlock them by grinding would be arduous.

425
00:29:46,575 --> 00:29:48,020
Scott: Like, you're just not gonna.

426
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:57,053
Rym: I mean, again, considering that there is an option on the front page of the Steam page for this game to spend $99.99 on coins, that is extremely worrying.

427
00:30:01,461 --> 00:30:08,239
Scott: Assuming you only spend your currencies on unlocking and not on cosmetic worthless crap, right?

428
00:30:09,901 --> 00:30:14,740
Scott: You would still have to spend a small fortune, I didn't calculate it, to unlock all of the Gundams, right?

429
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:18,473
Scott: It's like, okay, but, you know, people have that same argument like we just talked about.

430
00:30:18,814 --> 00:30:20,420
Scott: It's borderline pay to win, right?

431
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:23,726
Scott: Would Street Fighter be unfair if I only had Ryu?

432
00:30:23,887 --> 00:30:25,049
Scott: Like, what if Ryu's my main?

433
00:30:25,109 --> 00:30:30,780
Scott: Then it doesn't matter that I can't be, you know, M. Bison because I don't play M. Bison, right?

434
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,305
Scott: It's like, who cares?

435
00:30:32,866 --> 00:30:37,060
Scott: But, you know, if you only play one Gundam, what does it matter if you didn't unlock the other ones?

436
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,241
Scott: Here's the problem.

437
00:30:38,822 --> 00:30:49,760
Scott: This game, unlike, say, Overwatch, I presume, the Gundams that are not unlocked for free automatically are vastly superior.

438
00:30:50,661 --> 00:30:57,960
Scott: Ah, see, Overwatch- They are- they did not- the ones that you have to grind or pay to unlock are just better.

439
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:10,680
Rym: Overwatch is set up such that- Every single character is on the Pareto Frontier at all times, and most of the design tweaks they make in the patches are making sure that Frontier remains constant.

440
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,399
Rym: Every character is viable, every character is equally useful.

441
00:31:15,185 --> 00:31:15,507
Scott: Yeah.

442
00:31:15,527 --> 00:31:17,419
Scott: So, yeah, it's, uh, you know.

443
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:23,220
Rym: I mean, developed by Bandai Namco Online already does not give one confidence in this game.

444
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:34,039
Scott: You know, it's disappointing because we had an opportunity to have, like, a cool Gundam online multiplayer game, which, you know, just that alone, that concept is, like, S-tier, the execution, F-tier.

445
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:35,305
Rym: Yep.

446
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,472
Scott: Maybe D-tier.

447
00:31:37,492 --> 00:31:38,138
Scott: Maybe.

448
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,647
Rym: But, anyway, things of the day!

449
00:31:46,728 --> 00:31:51,040
Rym: Real quick, 'cause I have some really good stuff that I want to save for appropriate days for a reason.

450
00:31:52,301 --> 00:32:00,918
Rym: So, if you don't do, like, outdoor sportsy stuff, a lot of people like to use the GoPros, but a lot of people lately, because they've gotten cheaper, like to use 360 action cams.

451
00:32:02,481 --> 00:32:04,619
Rym: So, imagine, like, a GoPro- Oh, GoPro makes one.

452
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,440
Rym: Yeah, but other people make 'em too, but they're more common now.

453
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:10,640
Scott: There's a lot of companies making a lot of action cams these days of all kinds.

454
00:32:11,181 --> 00:32:23,080
Rym: Which is interesting, because there's, uh, I don't know, I feel like there's actually a limited audience for them, because most people, by one, realize that they're not that good at whatever sport it is that they're videoing themselves doing, and then it collects dust.

455
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:34,219
Rym: But, uh, this person has shown the best possible use case for a non-super professional to, like, what you should do with a 360 action cam.

456
00:32:35,642 --> 00:32:37,860
Rym: This is a 12-second video, and it is delightful.

457
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:41,740
Rym: It kind of reminds me of a Syriac animation.

458
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:42,800
Scott: Yep.

459
00:32:43,641 --> 00:33:07,700
Scott: So, the, uh, the Steam Deck is out, and even though I don't really feel any desire to get one or need one, considering what I- the devices I already possess, I could see that clearly it is popular, uh, people like it, and, uh, someone who owns not the great multitude of devices that I own would probably, you know, especially some kid, you know, it's like this could be a great thing to have.

460
00:33:07,967 --> 00:33:08,238
Scott: Yeah.

461
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:24,040
Scott: So, one thing, the, uh, it, I guess, minor news, if you somehow miss this big news, uh, in one of the marketing materials for the Steam Deck, uh, a Switch emulator, a screenshot of a Switch emulator appeared.

462
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:31,200
Scott: So, someone at Valve who's making marketing materials had a Switch emulator installed on the Steam Deck, and they removed that.

463
00:33:31,821 --> 00:33:38,572
Scott: Um, but anyway, uh, if you want to play, you know, some GBA games or whatever, right?

464
00:33:38,652 --> 00:33:43,600
Scott: Yeah, sure, you could probably get a GBA emulator on there and all the ROMs, because it's just a PC, right?

465
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,283
Scott: Uh, but there's this device you can buy.

466
00:33:46,303 --> 00:33:59,038
Scott: that's, uh, a GBA operator, right, which is like a little USB dock that you can put GBA cartridges into, and presumably, therefore, also Game Boy and Game Boy Color, because they're the same slot, kinda?

467
00:33:59,479 --> 00:33:59,779
Scott: Maybe?

468
00:33:59,879 --> 00:34:00,180
Scott: I don't know.

469
00:34:01,141 --> 00:34:22,760
Scott: Um, and then, you install the software on the computer, and now you can play that game on that computer, and your, that's technically not illegal at all, in any way, shape, or form, um, because you have the cartridge, you didn't download ROMs, the software isn't illegal, you know, you can just do it.

470
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:37,659
Scott: So, somebody took this and plugged it in with a USB cable into their Steam Deck, and now that's, like, a really great way to play Game Boy games, except, uh, for the USB cable and thing flappin' around.

471
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:45,239
Rym: This might be a really good way to stream GBA games, which is currently a pain, or most people secretly use an emulator.

472
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:52,206
Scott: Yeah, well, GBA game streaming is actually not difficult, uh, what's difficult is DS game streaming.

473
00:34:52,666 --> 00:34:54,628
Scott: That's the, that's the tough one, right?

474
00:34:54,668 --> 00:34:58,812
Scott: Some people have managed it, but, I mean, I've done a ton of,

475
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:07,680
Rym: I did a ton of DS streams, uh, back in the day that actually weirdly have a lot of views, I should maybe start that up again, but, uh, I just used an emulator and it worked perfectly.

476
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:22,440
Scott: But I can see somebody just has to do a little modding here to sort of get this device into a different enclosure, sort of mount it on the back of the Steam Deck, you know, to make it not a cable flappin' around, and you got yourself a pretty good thing goin' here.

477
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:28,120
Rym: Yep, Steam Deck's not terrible hardware, it's just not somethin' Scott or I need for our current use cases.

478
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:34,374
Scott: Yeah, and, I mean, as good as my GBA that's upgraded is, that Steam Deck has a vastly superior screen, right?

479
00:35:34,515 --> 00:35:36,800
Scott: And it's probably more comfortable to hold as well, so.

480
00:35:37,661 --> 00:35:49,720
Rym: So, in the meta moment, the GeekNights Book Club book, Binti, it's actually, there are three books, we're gonna talk about all three because they're so short, it'll take you, like, a few hours to read them all, and we're gonna do this episode on Thursday.

481
00:35:51,293 --> 00:35:51,440
Scott: Yep.

482
00:35:52,341 --> 00:36:02,580
Rym: Uh, it's about someone who goes to Space College, and, uh, it's got a lot of little twists and turns along the way, and, uh, wait 'til you meet the desert people.

483
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:04,962
Rym: I'll leave it at that.

484
00:36:05,262 --> 00:36:06,764
Rym: There's good stuff goin' on in those books.

485
00:36:07,205 --> 00:36:16,580
Rym: So, uh, this'll be the Book Club book, and then Scott's gonna reveal his choices, and, uh, the GeekNights Book Club will continue in its post-Genji life.

486
00:36:18,381 --> 00:36:26,777
Rym: Also, we will be live at PAX Unplugged, maybe me and Scott, maybe just me, on Sunday, with an updated version of our Take Your Fuckin' Turn panel.

487
00:36:27,058 --> 00:36:28,000
Rym: That's the one that PAX won.

488
00:36:29,141 --> 00:36:31,460
Rym: Uh, whatever Sunday of PAX Unplugged.

489
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:37,700
Rym: Whenever PAX Unplugged is, on Sunday, of PAX Unplugged, that will be our panel.

490
00:36:39,086 --> 00:36:39,171
Scott: Okay.

491
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:46,558
Rym: I wanna say we're in the Crab God Theater this year, and I got, I don't have the email open, I just got it, so, uh, yeah, we will be there on Sunday doin' a panel.

492
00:36:46,959 --> 00:36:47,925
Scott: Otherwise- Oh, there it is.

493
00:36:48,026 --> 00:36:49,376
Scott: That would be December 4th.

494
00:36:50,100 --> 00:37:11,039
Rym: So I imagine, uh, even if Scott and I both go and do the panel, we will only be at PAX Unplugged Sunday, because, while badges are not sold out, hotels are sold out on Saturday, it is a fully masked, and you have to prove vaccination event, uh, panelists have to wear masks, so we'll be on stage in masks, and, uh, yeah, we'll be around at most Sunday.

495
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:12,540
Rym: Don't expect to see us Friday or Saturday.

496
00:37:13,366 --> 00:37:13,640
Scott: Alright.

497
00:37:15,101 --> 00:37:16,504
Scott: Uh, working on the website still.

498
00:37:16,545 --> 00:37:22,580
Scott: I'm now past the part where I build the way to make it convenient for Rym to upload new episodes.

499
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,242
Rym: Hooray!

500
00:37:23,343 --> 00:37:25,098
Rym: That's the part I'm most looking forward to.

501
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:35,280
Scott: And then I am now, well, it still has more features that could be added to it, but it is vastly superior, and now I am working on the import the data from our current website to the new website part.

502
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:40,940
Rym: We, uh, we got a lot of episodes, and, uh- That does, that doesn't matter.

503
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,828
Rym: Yeah, that doesn't matter.

504
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:44,100
Scott: Also, I did realize- It doesn't make it any harder or easier.

505
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:47,629
Rym: I was looking at, uh, the labels or the tags.

506
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:52,120
Rym: We have an extremely inconsistent tagging system of random nonsense in there.

507
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,180
Scott: It's gonna, it will remain.

508
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:54,168
Rym: Good.

509
00:37:56,703 --> 00:38:05,540
Scott: Um, alright, so, today's episode is about a game called- Moonbreaker, which is another free-to-play online game.

510
00:38:06,186 --> 00:38:06,540
Rym: Indeed.

511
00:38:06,901 --> 00:38:13,860
Rym: Gonna come right out the gate by saying it is early access, so anything we say take with a grain of salt, but- Yep.

512
00:38:14,301 --> 00:38:19,351
Scott: All of these problems could very well be addressed for when the game is fully released.

513
00:38:19,391 --> 00:38:22,838
Scott: However, for something that's early access, it is quite impressive.

514
00:38:22,938 --> 00:38:23,920
Scott: Like, you could have fooled me.

515
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:24,921
Rym: Yep.

516
00:38:25,201 --> 00:38:32,380
Rym: It's, it's tough though, because on one hand, well, you know, it is, it is a really good idea that no one's ever done successfully before.

517
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,439
Rym: Like, I haven't seen someone try this hard.

518
00:38:35,185 --> 00:38:37,500
Rym: Uh, two, they got a lot of the right people involved.

519
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:45,660
Rym: Three, uh, it, it's almost fun, but as the game is today, it is not actually fun to play.

520
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:46,780
Scott: Yep.

521
00:38:46,961 --> 00:38:48,664
Scott: So, the story of this game.

522
00:38:48,704 --> 00:38:55,920
Scott: This game is developed by Unknown Worlds, the people who made Natural Selection, Natural Selection 2, and Subnautica.

523
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:59,212
Scott: You know, Natural Selection, that's the real game, right?

524
00:38:59,332 --> 00:39:01,160
Scott: It's like, let's just bring that back.

525
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,154
Rym: Scott, you wanna play NS2?

526
00:39:03,504 --> 00:39:04,133
Scott: No, I wanna play NS1.

527
00:39:05,464 --> 00:39:06,439
Rym: Uh, we could probably get that going.

528
00:39:07,301 --> 00:39:11,333
Scott: With a bunch of gorgeous, a bop around on a RT, you know.

529
00:39:11,534 --> 00:39:13,620
Scott: Anyway, yeah, those days are never coming back.

530
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:21,320
Scott: Alright, uh, and it's really, it's like literally, you know, Flaira, right, the internet name of the person who started it all, right?

531
00:39:21,621 --> 00:39:29,299
Scott: It's like, I've been on Natural Selection servers, Natural Selection 1 servers playing with Flaira in 2000-something.

532
00:39:30,141 --> 00:39:34,820
Scott: And today, go to the Moonbreaker Discord and it's like, Flaira is the same person.

533
00:39:35,443 --> 00:39:36,119
Scott: At four, at four.

534
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:36,598
Scott: 20 years later.

535
00:39:36,922 --> 00:39:37,438
Rym: Everybody at four.

536
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:38,981
Scott: Right, yeah.

537
00:39:39,442 --> 00:39:42,008
Scott: So, it's the same exact team, basically.

538
00:39:42,369 --> 00:39:47,560
Scott: Um, and what this game is, it is a tabletop miniatures game, like fucking Warhammer.

539
00:39:47,701 --> 00:39:49,047
Scott: But a squad-based one, right?

540
00:39:49,087 --> 00:39:51,880
Scott: Not too many, not a whole army, just a handful of units, right?

541
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,384
Scott: Uh, but recreated digitally.

542
00:39:54,484 --> 00:40:02,100
Scott: So, it's, it's like, the units, it's like you put them down on the board and like, they actually, you know, they have a little base and they're a little miniature.

543
00:40:02,381 --> 00:40:04,309
Scott: And they don't animate or anything, right?

544
00:40:04,449 --> 00:40:07,060
Scott: Except when they attack, they spin around or whatever, you know, kinda.

545
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:11,311
Scott: But, you know, you move them around, it's like you're playing miniatures.

546
00:40:11,371 --> 00:40:14,500
Scott: It's more like, you know, visually, it's like tabletop simulator, right?

547
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,000
Scott: You're moving miniatures around.

548
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:24,460
Rym: Or like a battle system, like the games where you would need to measure things, like a unit moves X inches and you gotta like deal with nonsense.

549
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,627
Scott: There's no grid, there's no hex grid or anything like that, right?

550
00:40:27,928 --> 00:40:32,380
Scott: You even can paint the miniatures freely, as much as you want.

551
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:33,704
Scott: Digital painting, right?

552
00:40:33,744 --> 00:40:38,700
Scott: So, you don't have to have an airbrush and all this mess and equipment in your house and spend money on paints.

553
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,909
Scott: You can paint miniatures to your heart's content.

554
00:40:41,969 --> 00:40:45,400
Scott: Multiple paint schemes, you can run wild, there's so many paintings.

555
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:54,279
Rym: It's got like inking tools in there and washing and dry brushing, like automatic masking and it's going hard on this, which is cool.

556
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,467
Scott: Yeah, that's a great idea.

557
00:40:57,548 --> 00:41:00,460
Scott: And then you can use your paint job when you play, right?

558
00:41:00,901 --> 00:41:08,100
Scott: So, you know, it sort of makes up for the fact that you don't have that many, at least not right now, don't have that many units to choose from for your army, right?

559
00:41:08,962 --> 00:41:10,384
Scott: So, how does the game actually work?

560
00:41:10,404 --> 00:41:18,600
Scott: Well, the game itself is actually closer to a Hearthstone type card game than it is to a miniatures game, right?

561
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:26,380
Scott: There is the same sort of Magic the Gathering Hearthstone mana scaling, like on turn one, your commander is on the board, no matter what.

562
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,069
Scott: And then you have one cinder, which is basically mana, right?

563
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:35,740
Scott: And on turn two, you get two cinder and turn three, you get three cinder and so forth.

564
00:41:36,302 --> 00:41:41,120
Scott: And you can bank, if you don't use all your cinder, you can bank up to three for the next turn.

565
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:49,360
Rym: Yup, so instead of like Magic the Gathering where you play a land, now you got one land out, you do your thing, next turn you play another land, next turn you play another land, now you got three land.

566
00:41:49,842 --> 00:41:51,460
Rym: It just does this, this is just automatic.

567
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:55,690
Scott: So every unit that's on the board can move, right?

568
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:58,017
Scott: Its movement range, every turn, right?

569
00:41:58,197 --> 00:41:59,060
Scott: No matter what, that's free.

570
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:12,680
Scott: Every unit can, if it has a base attack, not all of them do, some of them only have special abilities, but most of them have a base attack, can use its attack if it starts or ends its movement within range of an enemy.

571
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:20,780
Scott: So for a melee attack, it has to basically be right next to an enemy when it attacks, but it can attack and then run, or run then attack, the order is not constrained.

572
00:42:21,561 --> 00:42:32,840
Scott: And for a ranged attack, it just has to have line of sight, and it can attempt to shoot, and if there's, you know, sort of partial cover, you'll sort of get a decrease on your accuracy, right?

573
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:39,300
Scott: But if you want, you can get really right up next to a guy and use a ranged attack in melee range, and it's very very likely to hit.

574
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,360
Scott: And then there's a random chance of crits, whatever, right?

575
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:48,960
Scott: And then, units have special abilities, special abilities cost cinder to use, right?

576
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:52,580
Rym: Yep, so you might have a guy who costs 3 cinder to put out on the board, like cool.

577
00:42:53,120 --> 00:43:01,180
Rym: That guy might have a power spend 2 cinder to lob a bomb of some kind, independent of their other actions like moving.

578
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:02,380
Scott: Yep, exactly.

579
00:43:02,682 --> 00:43:05,200
Rym: So like a magic card or a hearthstone card, except a little miniature.

580
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:17,480
Scott: And the final aspect is that you have a hand of randomly selected units from your, you basically, when you build your army of dudes, there's all the dudes that are in the game, and you can only choose each dude once.

581
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:20,920
Scott: So you can't make an army with like two of the same dude in it, right?

582
00:43:21,481 --> 00:43:29,960
Scott: So you choose a set of dudes, and you draw them, you draw them all, they're all unique, but obviously your opponent is going to have a lot of the same ones, because there's not that many.

583
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:40,240
Scott: And then you draw a hand at the start, and if you need to draw more units into your hand, it costs 3 cinder to draw a new unit into your hand.

584
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:50,180
Rym: Like El Grande, you've got people out in the hinterlands, and you have to pay or do something to bring them on deck, and then you have to pay or do something else to put them out on the board.

585
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:56,900
Scott: Yeah, on deck is in your hand, and then you know what's in your hand, but the deck, you don't know the order of what the dudes are in there, right?

586
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:02,752
Scott: And then you play them on the board, and when you play them on the board, you just have to play them within range of your main guy.

587
00:44:02,792 --> 00:44:06,440
Scott: They can't drop anywhere on the board, they have to be within your main guy's area.

588
00:44:06,981 --> 00:44:10,129
Scott: And the objective of the game is pretty simple, which is kill the other person's main guy.

589
00:44:10,149 --> 00:44:12,795
Scott: Whoever's main guy dies first, loses.

590
00:44:12,936 --> 00:44:14,519
Scott: That's it, that's all there is to it.

591
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:30,240
Rym: So, in terms of gameplay, it's a cool idea, the concept is great, and I wish them luck, but at this current stage, it's not that fun to play, partly because it is very hard to see what is going on.

592
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:36,280
Rym: Like, Scott very smartly painted all his guys just solid green, because that's the only way to actually differentiate anything.

593
00:44:38,021 --> 00:44:46,760
Rym: Like, it's hard to tell the status of anything, all the things on the maps, all the models, everything, just kind of merge together into one big mess of pixels.

594
00:44:47,201 --> 00:44:56,820
Rym: And even I play a guy, and it's hard to keep track of which guys I've moved, which guys I haven't, which guys are out there, which guys are like, the UX is just not even close to there yet.

595
00:44:57,721 --> 00:45:10,400
Scott: I think a lot of it is that all the information about the status of the game state is there in the UI, but a lot of it, in order to see, you have to click on a guy or hover over a guy and read something, right?

596
00:45:11,401 --> 00:45:17,699
Scott: There isn't just this immediate, clear visual clarity of what is up with everything on the board right now.

597
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,522
Rym: There's nothing as simple as, like, Advance Wars.

598
00:45:19,603 --> 00:45:29,637
Rym: One of the buttons in Advance Wars, as in most games like that, is it'll cycle through all the units you have, in some sort of order, that have any actions.

599
00:45:29,677 --> 00:45:31,340
Rym: they could still take this turn.

600
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:33,083
Rym: Like, one last sanity check.

601
00:45:33,364 --> 00:45:34,647
Rym: The game has nothing like that.

602
00:45:34,787 --> 00:45:39,900
Rym: I have forgotten to move units so frequently that that is, like, that is a part of the game.

603
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:43,760
Scott: And then you got a guy who all he can do is move and attack, no special abilities, right?

604
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:55,720
Scott: If you just look at the board, you can't tell by looking at the guy whether he's moved already or not, you have to click on him to see if the move button is lit up, and after you move him he doesn't look any different, and then has he attacked yet?

605
00:45:56,060 --> 00:46:00,920
Scott: You can't tell just by looking at him, you have to hover over him or click on him to see has the guy attacked yet, right?

606
00:46:01,301 --> 00:46:11,400
Rym: Even worse, there's no way to undo anything, so if you misclick, like, you click kind of fast on a guy and you accidentally move him when you just wanted to see if he could move, well, he moved, that's it, you're screwed, even though...

607
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:17,340
Scott: Yeah, a lot of times I'll move a guy, he'll just, like, bump into something and I'll be like, oops, and then that's it, can't move now, that was your move.

608
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:18,960
Rym: Now there are real world...

609
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:24,860
Scott: It would be nicer if it was, like, you have movement distance and you can keep moving until you use up all the distance.

610
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:34,860
Rym: There are real world wargames, I'll say battle system, because that's the system I know has this, I will be shocked if anyone listening to GeekNights even knows what battle system is, let alone has played it.

611
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:47,796
Rym: But it had rules like, if you move units, you declare their move first, then you pull out the measuring tape and see what actually happens, because you might have over-underestimated or messed something up along the way, and this game

612
00:46:48,437 --> 00:46:48,898
Scott: arguably

613
00:46:48,938 --> 00:47:02,611
Rym: could be trying to evoke that kind of feeling, but in effect, it just feels shitty, where you move a guy, and you're off by, like, one pixel, and then your next guy can't move past them, and you're just screwed, but there was no way to actually see that.

614
00:47:02,631 --> 00:47:13,320
Rym: that would have been the outcome, because you're not physically there with tables, so the game doesn't give you any tools to figure this out, and that is frustrating enough to where I hesitate to play the game.

615
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:33,360
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know, when you're clicking on a guy to move that unit, that's actually a really pretty good user interface, you can see the range of where they can move to, right, you can sort of try different positions, you know, you can tell sort of whether he's going to be in melee range or not, based on, like, this yellow border thing that groups around guys who are in melee range.

616
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:54,716
Scott: There's red lines showing you that, like, which ranged enemy units will be able to have line of sight to your guy, a lot of helpful things, but it's not, and there'll be, like, these vague white borders that show you, like, what the range of that guy's special abilities will be, so you can sort of say, "Ah, I'll move him, and he'll get in range for that other guy's special ability,".

617
00:47:54,736 --> 00:47:59,920
Scott: like so, right, but what you can't do is sort of get combinations of information, right?

618
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:15,920
Scott: Like, okay, if I drop this guy here, like, when I'm dropping a guy from space out of my hand, I can see where I can drop him, but I can't tell, well, if I drop him there, will he then be able to move that far to get in melee range?

619
00:48:16,661 --> 00:48:19,884
Scott: You can't, it doesn't let you measure a step ahead, right?

620
00:48:19,904 --> 00:48:32,615
Scott: It's like, okay, I'll move, I can move this guy here, and I can see that there's a space between him and the wall, is that space big enough for yet this other unit to get through there if he moves second?

621
00:48:32,956 --> 00:48:37,460
Scott: Maybe I should just move that second unit first to avoid having to ask that question.

622
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,808
Rym: This is actually, this is some of the stuff that worries me.

623
00:48:39,828 --> 00:48:43,540
Scott: But I really want the other unit to do something else first, you know.

624
00:48:43,660 --> 00:49:05,500
Rym: Because if this game were more like those bigger war games, then that would, all those kinds of micro, like, oh, he couldn't, that guy couldn't get through, I misjudged it, would kind of wash out over time due to the scale of the conflict, but this game, the battles, at least in early access, take place in very small, very simple maps, and as a result,

625
00:49:05,622 --> 00:49:06,658
Scott: With very few guys?

626
00:49:07,321 --> 00:49:09,972
Rym: A one pixel mis-move is just game over.

627
00:49:10,012 --> 00:49:11,800
Rym: Like, GG, you've just lost, concede immediately.

628
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:13,980
Scott: It could be very, it could be very significant.

629
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:28,460
Rym: But, if you- Even worse, I don't think this game could ever support larger maps, because the mechanics, other than the special powers, are simplistic- No, this isn't, this isn't going to suddenly change into a big army game, that's what's happening.

630
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:31,564
Rym: This is a very small army game, and here is my fundamental worry.

631
00:49:32,666 --> 00:49:38,594
Rym: All of the factors of how this game plays combined, I feel like in the end, it's just Naroshima Hex with extra steps.

632
00:49:38,954 --> 00:49:42,960
Rym: It's Naroshima Hex with an infinite number of hexes on a tiny map.

633
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:51,860
Scott: I don't think it's Naroshima Hex, I think it's Hearthstone, except you actually position your dudes instead of just having them in a row, there's actually just complex positioning.

634
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:52,581
Scott: Yeah,

635
00:49:52,881 --> 00:50:05,092
Rym: but the problem is, because the maps are so small, and the movements are so low, and the rules for, like, ranged are extremely simplistic, I don't, like, I think

636
00:50:05,793 --> 00:50:06,273
Scott: moving

637
00:50:06,413 --> 00:50:14,120
Rym: and interacting on the map will be obvious and easy, and that will never, like, positioning and cleverness there will not be the factor.

638
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:18,100
Rym: The deck and, like, the macro is the only thing that's going to matter.

639
00:50:18,621 --> 00:50:34,500
Scott: The card part of the game, right, which you guys, you draw, when do you play them, in what order, right, is going to matter a lot more than, the positioning is just, you know, making it a little bit more complex and interesting than a Hearthstone, right?

640
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:51,100
Scott: But it's not the primary thing, it's like, you can, you know, you can get over that, right, and what determines who wins and loses is going to be what order you draw your guys, what guys you selected, how you spend your cinder, right, that's the big, you know, decisions that matter the most.

641
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:54,644
Rym: But the problem is, I want the miniatures game.

642
00:50:55,185 --> 00:51:07,200
Rym: If this, I want, like, moving the miniatures and fighting with the miniatures with simpler rules on the individual miniatures is more compelling to me than basically just playing Hearthstone that happens to have this map.

643
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:17,300
Rym: It almost feels like Magic the Conquering, which again, if any GeekNights listener played that game, like, let me know, because I'm not convinced that anyone played it except me.

644
00:51:17,961 --> 00:51:18,983
Scott: I forgot it existed.

645
00:51:19,083 --> 00:51:29,620
Rym: Yeah, it wasn't even official, it was, like, published in Scryde as a variant to Magic where you would play your creatures onto a little map and it was just Magic with extra steps, like, it wasn't good.

646
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:32,201
Scott: No.

647
00:51:32,281 --> 00:51:44,240
Scott: But yeah, so the thing is, you know, I think if they fix the user interface parts of this game and they increase the number of units to make it much more interesting, like, which guys you select, right?

648
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:59,100
Scott: And they fix the balance issues, which you haven't mentioned yet, there's a lot to fix here, a lot, that I would actually play the game if they could fix all these things, right?

649
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:01,314
Scott: But it's like, are they gonna fix all these things?

650
00:52:01,394 --> 00:52:02,180
Scott: I'm not that confident.

651
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:02,721
Rym: Yep.

652
00:52:02,921 --> 00:52:09,810
Rym: Well, I'm also worried about the fact that you get new guys via buying booster packs that you unlock and grind.

653
00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:14,235
Rym: There's this whole other mode that I refuse to even play.

654
00:52:14,255 --> 00:52:17,920
Rym: that is literally just grind out cosmetic crap.

655
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,002
Scott: Yep, so let's talk about this.

656
00:52:20,103 --> 00:52:22,547
Scott: other, what's going on, you know, with how you pay for the game.

657
00:52:22,828 --> 00:52:23,910
Scott: This is not a free game.

658
00:52:24,371 --> 00:52:26,194
Scott: You gotta pay for this game, right?

659
00:52:26,455 --> 00:52:28,038
Scott: Pay real money, buy it, right?

660
00:52:28,118 --> 00:52:29,320
Scott: It's not free to play.

661
00:52:29,961 --> 00:52:36,451
Scott: So if you buy the game, that gets the expectation that people have as free, most people are free to play out there, right?

662
00:52:36,891 --> 00:52:39,996
Scott: Is that if you pay for the game, you should be getting a ton of shit, right?

663
00:52:40,377 --> 00:52:42,660
Scott: Of the consumable coins and whatnot, right?

664
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:45,284
Scott: And you kind of do, right?

665
00:52:45,364 --> 00:52:46,726
Scott: It's like, basically you pay for the game.

666
00:52:46,806 --> 00:52:54,240
Scott: It's like, you're going to unlock all, I unlocked all the units in like less than 30 minutes, like just with the stuff that came with the game, right?

667
00:52:55,800 --> 00:53:04,994
Scott: So it's like, yes, it still has that question mark pay to win, but the only thing that will separate players is do you have all the units unlocked or not?

668
00:53:05,835 --> 00:53:09,160
Scott: Everything else is cosmetic and unlocking them all is currently trivial.

669
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:12,786
Rym: Well just now, Scott picked a character that's in the meta and I have the default deck and you know what?

670
00:53:13,527 --> 00:53:20,760
Rym: It would be, there is literally nothing I could do in the game to beat Scott's character with the deck that I have.

671
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,560
Scott: Well, that's a separate issue because that character's broken.

672
00:53:24,583 --> 00:53:26,073
Rym: Yeah, that's sort of the fun.

673
00:53:26,355 --> 00:53:27,000
Scott: The game balance.

674
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:32,440
Scott: They had a tournament and they bet they had the first tournament, they made people win with like two characters.

675
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:36,450
Rym: It's not just that the game balance is not great because it's early access.

676
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:39,740
Rym: Like that's, I would expect the game balance to not be there yet in a game like this.

677
00:53:40,461 --> 00:53:45,786
Rym: It's that I don't think the kinds of powers they have introduced even in the first set are balanceable.

678
00:53:46,166 --> 00:53:59,440
Rym: They have made the same mistake that Magic the Gathering made in Unlimited and Revised where there were cards that did game breaking kinds of things that you cannot do in games like this full stop.

679
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:02,095
Rym: These are like the hard rules of game design.

680
00:54:02,377 --> 00:54:02,800
Rym: Moxes.

681
00:54:02,962 --> 00:54:04,139
Scott: Every game messes this up.

682
00:54:04,221 --> 00:54:05,338
Rym: You cannot have a thing like that.

683
00:54:06,741 --> 00:54:10,380
Scott: Every game that has some sort of mana system messes this up.

684
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:14,453
Scott: It's like in Magic the Gathering, it's like every turn.

685
00:54:14,573 --> 00:54:16,319
Scott: you can play a land if you got one.

686
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:21,860
Scott: And so your mana scales, hopefully, at one per turn unless you don't draw land.

687
00:54:22,701 --> 00:54:27,373
Scott: Most of the newer games, they got rid of the random part and they just said one per turn.

688
00:54:27,493 --> 00:54:30,140
Scott: Everyone is scaling up their power at the same rate.

689
00:54:30,941 --> 00:54:34,949
Scott: And if you bring a guy into the field, you can't use him immediately.

690
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:40,800
Scott: You have to wait until next turn so that way you can't surprise your opponent with any bullshit.

691
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:55,940
Scott: And even in Magic the Gathering, the first game that did this kind of stuff, it's like if you want to surprise your opponent with bullshit on their turn, that means you're leaving mana untapped on your turn and your opponent can see that you have mana just sitting there waiting for a counterspell.

692
00:54:56,881 --> 00:54:58,984
Scott: So, what did this game do?

693
00:54:59,425 --> 00:55:00,988
Scott: Well, you have the Cinder, right?

694
00:55:01,529 --> 00:55:05,857
Scott: One of the characters has an ability for one Cinder.

695
00:55:05,897 --> 00:55:07,520
Scott: They can use this ability on the first turn.

696
00:55:09,201 --> 00:55:15,320
Scott: They pick one at random, one of the units in their hand, and the cost of that unit goes down by two.

697
00:55:16,121 --> 00:55:20,000
Rym: That is worse than a Mox Emerald in Magic.

698
00:55:20,863 --> 00:55:21,525
Scott: That is right.

699
00:55:21,726 --> 00:55:26,120
Rym: And then, wait, this character has... That's like a Sol Ring game breaker right there.

700
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:26,761
Scott: So, hold on.

701
00:55:26,821 --> 00:55:28,824
Scott: This character also has two other abilities.

702
00:55:29,024 --> 00:55:39,080
Scott: One other ability the character has is that if there is a unit within range of them that is stunned, which means it can't do anything.

703
00:55:39,501 --> 00:55:40,645
Scott: It's a stunned unit.

704
00:55:40,665 --> 00:55:42,610
Scott: And when you summon units, they're stunned.

705
00:55:42,751 --> 00:55:45,720
Scott: And they can't do anything until next turn when the stun wears off.

706
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:51,088
Scott: For two Cinder, this character can un-stun a unit within range.

707
00:55:51,388 --> 00:55:58,540
Scott: So, you can summon a guy that was discounted, immediately activate it, and then it can move and attack immediately and surprise your opponent.

708
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:02,960
Rym: That kind of thing in any game is absolutely unbeatable.

709
00:56:03,682 --> 00:56:03,882
Scott: Yep.

710
00:56:04,163 --> 00:56:04,384
Scott: Wait.

711
00:56:04,564 --> 00:56:10,600
Scott: And there is one more thing this character can do that is somewhat interesting but still bad and broken.

712
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:18,335
Scott: This character, to balance out the fact that they have these ridiculous abilities, their base attack is just a little one damage ranged attack.

713
00:56:18,456 --> 00:56:19,418
Scott: It's really weak.

714
00:56:19,478 --> 00:56:20,520
Scott: It doesn't do much, right?

715
00:56:21,201 --> 00:56:32,400
Scott: However, if that little one damage ranged attack, right, which could be boosted by the way by other characters doing some, you know, whatever, enhancements or support abilities, right?

716
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:50,100
Scott: But anyway, if that main character kills and does the finishing blow, the last hit on an enemy, right, then that character will automatically draw a new guy from the deck to their hand, which typically costs three Cinder.

717
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:51,361
Scott: Right?

718
00:56:51,903 --> 00:57:00,260
Scott: So, that's a way to basically eliminate a three Cinder cost by just last hitting a guy, which admittedly, that's sort of a nice mechanic, right?

719
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:05,507
Scott: If you do this clever thing that takes planning and consideration, get a bonus.

720
00:57:05,847 --> 00:57:08,130
Scott: But that's a huge three, a three Cinder bonus.

721
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:15,780
Scott: Nothing, all the abilities should just be about damage or statuses or nothing should ever give you a free Cinder.

722
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:18,323
Scott: In Magic, nothing should ever give you a free mana.

723
00:57:18,363 --> 00:57:21,027
Scott: In Hearthstone, nothing should ever give you a free mana.

724
00:57:21,207 --> 00:57:24,431
Scott: Everyone, you had to lock in those hard rules of.

725
00:57:24,811 --> 00:57:31,820
Scott: this is the pace and scale of the game, and you summon a unit, it can't do jack shit till next turn, no matter what.

726
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:35,604
Scott: You cannot make abilities to cancel those rules, right?

727
00:57:35,724 --> 00:57:49,200
Scott: Yes, special abilities on units and cards should break the rules, but those rules should never be touched in every game ever that has messed with those rules, right, as resulted in brokenness.

728
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:55,147
Scott: In Netrunner, cards that let you get ridiculous numbers of credits, always, they broke the game every single time.

729
00:57:55,247 --> 00:58:00,973
Scott: It's like, there's a pace at which you're supposed to be getting credits, do not exceed that pace ever, right?

730
00:58:01,034 --> 00:58:03,156
Scott: It's like, the end, don't do it.

731
00:58:03,256 --> 00:58:06,660
Scott: And every fucking game does it, including this one.

732
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:33,799
Rym: But I also worry that because the maps are so small, there's a lot of abilities that stun and block people from moving, but the map is so small, and your movement is so little, that those are extremely overpowered as well, and they lock the game up, and it's part of why I was thinking about Nurtium Hex, because the map is so small, and there's so many obstructive powers, and such little movement, that

733
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:36,423
Scott: the game- Well,

734
00:58:36,523 --> 00:58:40,700
Rym: a lot of characters have a- that character can't move next round.

735
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:42,780
Scott: There's only one character that does that.

736
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:47,216
Rym: Nope, there's another character that, if it's standing next to someone, they can't move.

737
00:58:47,497 --> 00:58:48,720
Rym: There's another character- That's the jail guy.

738
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:59,340
Rym: If they hit someone, that person can't move, and those two powers just kind of lock the movement up and make the map less interesting and the deck more important.

739
00:59:01,324 --> 00:59:08,200
Scott: The last thing about this game- Well, they could also make more interesting maps that have all kinds of wacky Mario Kart shit going on.

740
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:14,636
Rym: I don't think they can, though, because the maps have to, by the nature of the core mechanics of the game, be very small.

741
00:59:14,917 --> 00:59:16,240
Rym: There's very little you can do with maps that small.

742
00:59:16,321 --> 00:59:17,360
Scott: Otherwise, melee is useless.

743
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:22,112
Scott: But they could fill the maps with all sorts of nonsense, right?

744
00:59:22,132 --> 00:59:24,459
Scott: Like, rivers, and volcanoes, and shit.

745
00:59:24,479 --> 00:59:24,780
Scott: that does stuff.

746
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:29,060
Rym: I don't think they could, though, because the map's too small relative to the size of the characters for that to matter.

747
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:31,908
Scott: It says, "Put all kinds of ridiculous nonsense on the

748
00:59:31,948 --> 00:59:32,148
Scott: map.".

749
00:59:32,409 --> 00:59:35,698
Scott: It's like, "Oops, you stood on the river, and then it came flowing, and it moved your

750
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:36,079
Scott: guy.".

751
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:38,517
Scott: Or, you know, do all kinds of stuff.

752
00:59:38,638 --> 00:59:38,820
Scott: Anyway.

753
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:44,224
Rym: Yeah, but I feel like most of that would become random nonsense that you couldn't reasonably- You don't make it random.

754
00:59:44,445 --> 00:59:45,612
Scott: You know when it's gonna happen.

755
00:59:46,436 --> 00:59:47,260
Scott: It's a decision now.

756
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:51,660
Rym: But there's so little space on the map that you'd be taking off half the map with that stuff.

757
00:59:52,581 --> 00:59:53,220
Scott: Make it smaller.

758
00:59:54,663 --> 00:59:55,797
Scott: Not everything has to be big.

759
00:59:56,100 --> 01:00:02,140
Rym: I think the entire map is like six of your biggest guy across, and I don't think they could be bigger mechanically.

760
01:00:03,482 --> 01:00:05,220
Scott: Uh, maybe eight of your biggest guy across?

761
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,439
Rym: I'm imagining in my head, because I want his game open in front of me.

762
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:08,742
Scott: Yeah, anyway.

763
01:00:09,325 --> 01:00:12,980
Scott: The last thing about this game is a positive and a negative, right?

764
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:16,970
Scott: The positive is that I don't like games where people play slow.

765
01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:17,512
Scott: You know us.

766
01:00:17,592 --> 01:00:20,560
Scott: We don't like people playing slow and not taking their turn, right?

767
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:21,284
Scott: That's awful.

768
01:00:21,344 --> 01:00:23,576
Scott: We want people to take their turn, right?

769
01:00:23,757 --> 01:00:24,220
Scott: Move it along.

770
01:00:24,341 --> 01:00:26,719
Rym: We're doing an entire panel on it and it PAX Unplugged.

771
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:27,761
Scott: That's right.

772
01:00:28,463 --> 01:00:38,298
Scott: And I've even considered, you know, one of the ideas that I always have in my shit-talk hopper is make a game where when the turn timer runs out, or you take damage.

773
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:39,406
Rym: Your computer explodes.

774
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:40,819
Rym: A spike comes out of your mouse.

775
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:41,600
Scott: Right.

776
01:00:41,781 --> 01:00:49,480
Scott: Or like a board game where the simultaneous turns and whoever finishes their turn first gets a benefit, or whoever finishes the turn last, right, gets a penalty.

777
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:57,380
Scott: Like just, you know, some direct effect of taking your turn faster to encourage quick play, right?

778
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:01,660
Scott: So I'm a person who really loves people to play fast, right?

779
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:07,155
Scott: In this game, the turn timer is too damn short.

780
01:01:07,656 --> 01:01:08,980
Scott: It is too short.

781
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:16,340
Rym: Now you have to understand the enormity of Scott fucking Rubin saying these words.

782
01:01:16,962 --> 01:01:17,504
Scott: That's right.

783
01:01:17,525 --> 01:01:21,460
Scott: It's like every other game, I'm like, hurry it up, take your fucking turn.

784
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:23,400
Scott: And in this game, it's too short, right?

785
01:01:24,021 --> 01:01:28,660
Scott: The decisions to make on the turn, right, can be done pretty quickly.

786
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:29,825
Scott: The big decisions.

787
01:01:29,865 --> 01:01:32,035
Scott: Which guys do I play, right?

788
01:01:32,136 --> 01:01:32,980
Scott: Who am I going to move?

789
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:40,420
Scott: But the thing is, because of the user interface, you can't at a glance figure out who's got what status is on them, right?

790
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:47,570
Scott: So it's like you got to sit there hovering over guys and clicking over guys and testing things out just to figure out what's possible.

791
01:01:47,952 --> 01:01:49,740
Scott: That takes time, right?

792
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:53,140
Scott: You can't just see it all at a glance immediately and process it quickly.

793
01:01:53,682 --> 01:01:57,420
Scott: And then you actually have to do execute all of these maneuvers, right?

794
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:01,413
Scott: And you want to position guys really carefully on this map.

795
01:02:01,453 --> 01:02:03,360
Scott: that's not just a hex grid, right?

796
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:04,906
Scott: Everything's pixel perfect.

797
01:02:04,926 --> 01:02:07,560
Scott: You know, like you'll move a guy.

798
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:13,280
Scott: It's like you'll try to move a guy a little bit just to get like an extra percentage chance to hit with a ranged attack, right?

799
01:02:13,561 --> 01:02:15,650
Scott: You're like carefully positioning this circle.

800
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:17,820
Scott: And it's like, that takes time.

801
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:24,300
Scott: And if you summon a lot of units on the board, you know, if you only got two units on the board, no problem, right?

802
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,348
Scott: Three, still probably no problem.

803
01:02:26,428 --> 01:02:33,140
Scott: Once you get to four or five, you do not have enough time, especially if you're going to be doing, maybe summoning more guys on your turn.

804
01:02:34,343 --> 01:02:35,760
Scott: It's like, you don't have enough time.

805
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:43,244
Rym: This could be okay if, one, you've played the game enough to where you know what all the characters do, which, you know, that's a learny thing.

806
01:02:43,284 --> 01:02:53,220
Rym: But two, if the UX of the game gave affordances to at a glance see the statuses of characters, see who moved, all these basic things that the game for some reason lacks.

807
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:54,641
Scott: Mm hmm.

808
01:02:54,661 --> 01:02:54,822
Scott: Yep.

809
01:02:55,484 --> 01:03:06,580
Scott: So it's really hard to actually, especially if you're new and you don't know all the abilities of all the units and you have to read stuff or whatever, you're going to get hit by the turn timer, which sucks because it's like your turn ends.

810
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:07,897
Scott: You didn't move all your dudes.

811
01:03:08,562 --> 01:03:13,440
Rym: And you know what, if you have one turn, if you have one turn where you don't use all your dudes, you've lost.

812
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:13,922
Rym: It's over.

813
01:03:14,204 --> 01:03:15,330
Rym: Like gate literally GG.

814
01:03:15,351 --> 01:03:16,779
Scott: Unless the other person messes up too.

815
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:17,201
Scott: Yeah.

816
01:03:17,221 --> 01:03:18,720
Scott: But it's like, that is harsh.

817
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:23,200
Scott: Now, thankfully, I'll be sitting there on a turn and I will be doing things constantly.

818
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:26,660
Scott: Like I won't, I won't be sitting there thinking, wasting time.

819
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:31,620
Scott: Like I'm constantly looking at guys, moving them, trying out positions, attacking.

820
01:03:32,121 --> 01:03:36,080
Scott: And then the turn timer comes up while I'm doing this and I'm still moving units.

821
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:37,968
Scott: And then the turn timer ends and it's like, really?

822
01:03:38,811 --> 01:03:39,333
Scott: Okay.

823
01:03:40,056 --> 01:03:40,980
Scott: That's too short, bro.

824
01:03:42,200 --> 01:04:09,600
Rym: So the, if the UX were better and, and the things they need to change are so specific and obvious and easy that it'll be a big warning sign if those things don't get changed, like in the next six months of early access, like if they don't highlight statuses of characters better, highlight what characters have moved or not moved, let you cycle through characters quickly, then I worry about the future of this game.

825
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:10,480
Scott: Yeah.

826
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:14,980
Scott: I think there might be a keyboard shortcut for the cycling, but it's, it's clearly not obvious.

827
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:16,385
Rym: It was definitely not obvious.

828
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:18,634
Rym: Also, why can't I zoom out all the way?

829
01:04:18,755 --> 01:04:19,920
Rym: The map's so tiny.

830
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:22,230
Rym: Why can't I just zoom out all the way?

831
01:04:22,552 --> 01:04:23,880
Rym: Zooming in, I know that.

832
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:29,120
Scott: Just give me, give me the overhead strategic view that gets rid of all the graphics and all the paint jobs.

833
01:04:29,140 --> 01:04:29,475
Scott: Like in Civ.

834
01:04:29,801 --> 01:04:32,576
Scott: It's like, yeah, just like Civ, just show me icons.

835
01:04:32,617 --> 01:04:33,220
Scott: That'll be easier.

836
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:35,160
Scott: I'll, I'll figure out everything really quickly with just a bunch of icons.

837
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:35,280
Scott: Cause

838
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:38,847
Rym: on one end I get that they want to focus on the models, but zooming in

839
01:04:39,328 --> 01:04:39,649
Scott: zooms

840
01:04:39,729 --> 01:04:51,280
Rym: in so far that it is worthless unless you're looking at the cool paint jobs and zooming out, you literally cannot zoom out far enough to like think about the entire map at any given time.

841
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:56,000
Scott: I think also if you could zoom out that you would, it would be hard to tell the different units apart.

842
01:04:56,241 --> 01:04:56,561
Rym: Yep.

843
01:04:56,822 --> 01:05:03,420
Rym: Especially because the way, if you do good paint jobs, nothing in the environment of the map stands out from anything else.

844
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:07,938
Rym: So unless you hover over something, it's not clear if that's a game affecting thing or not.

845
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:10,946
Rym: Like everything's just a mess of pixels.

846
01:05:11,687 --> 01:05:16,640
Rym: Uh, even to someone who's played the game a bunch and has a 4k monitor, it's just a mess of pixels.

847
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:17,860
Rym: It's hard to tell what's interacting.

848
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:23,560
Scott: I have to click on, other than your main guy who's huge and some other units that really stand out as different.

849
01:05:23,941 --> 01:05:29,400
Scott: It's like most of the, just like the units that are just a humanoid, it's like you have to click on them and remember which one that is.

850
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:30,445
Scott: It's like, which one is that again?

851
01:05:30,526 --> 01:05:31,209
Scott: Oh, the grenade one.

852
01:05:31,230 --> 01:05:32,014
Scott: Which one is that again?

853
01:05:32,074 --> 01:05:32,819
Scott: Oh, the fire guy.

854
01:05:32,859 --> 01:05:33,040
Scott: Okay.

855
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:34,503
Rym: And they all kind of look the same.

856
01:05:34,563 --> 01:05:42,140
Rym: Like when I paint my units, I feel like I'm going to paint all my units like bright blue if they're range, bright yellow if they're melee.

857
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:45,708
Scott: That's the one thing you can tell between is range and melee.

858
01:05:45,728 --> 01:05:49,980
Scott: Cause that's the only thing that's like a big symbol that's always on the UI no matter what.

859
01:05:50,621 --> 01:05:53,066
Scott: So like everything should be a symbol just like that.

860
01:05:53,106 --> 01:06:00,280
Scott: Like there should be a line of symbols at the top of each character just like that range melee symbol to show you all their statuses and whatnot.

861
01:06:01,020 --> 01:06:04,860
Scott: Uh, and abilities so that you don't have to click on them or hover over them to see what the deal is.

862
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:05,341
Rym: Yup.

863
01:06:05,782 --> 01:06:15,600
Rym: So an interesting thing about this game too is of all people, they got Brendan Sanderson to create an original like universe for this game.

864
01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:22,876
Rym: And uh, I'm going to read a terrifying sentence from you that I just learned by skimming through the Wikipedia.

865
01:06:22,896 --> 01:06:24,280
Rym: I got to find it again.

866
01:06:24,661 --> 01:06:33,340
Rym: It's too good because the listener asked in the chat, uh, which led me down this path, quote, have you listened to the audio drama stuff inside the game?

867
01:06:33,862 --> 01:06:37,420
Scott: I started to listen to it and then I was just like, nah, nevermind.

868
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:49,980
Rym: So the game started and I was doing like the tutorial and that first audio drama starts playing and I was on my laptop and I was also working on some other stuff and I couldn't figure out how to skip it at first.

869
01:06:51,860 --> 01:07:01,360
Scott: There's a button in the top right of the user interface that opens up a little media on the main menu at the top right and it opens up a little media player and you can use the media player to play the audio drama.

870
01:07:01,923 --> 01:07:04,839
Scott: And I start, I listened to it for like 30 seconds and I was like, I got time for this.

871
01:07:05,781 --> 01:07:05,961
Rym: Yup.

872
01:07:05,981 --> 01:07:09,789
Rym: So, uh, I'm just going to read this, uh, due to the gay, this is a quoting from Wikipedia.

873
01:07:10,269 --> 01:07:15,700
Rym: due to the game's large roster of characters and unknown worlds intention to support the game for years.

874
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:21,060
Rym: Moonbreaker will have a long form story that will last a decade or longer.

875
01:07:21,401 --> 01:07:27,380
Rym: He compared the game storytelling to that of Canterbury tales, a story told from the perspectives of 30 different pilgrims.

876
01:07:28,124 --> 01:07:29,451
Rym: I do not have time for that.

877
01:07:29,772 --> 01:07:31,260
Rym: I do not care.

878
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:34,595
Scott: I mean, do you care about Warhammer's story either?

879
01:07:34,656 --> 01:07:35,280
Scott: Some people do.

880
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:40,100
Rym: I care about knowing the name of whatever faction I would be playing at a really high level.

881
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:41,621
Rym: Uh, I don't know.

882
01:07:41,701 --> 01:07:54,300
Rym: I just, I've never been super jazzed about people trying to cram novels and movies into video games directly that don't necessarily interact with the game mechanically in any way.

883
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:55,731
Scott: Yeah, it's not like Half-Life 2.

884
01:07:55,731 --> 01:07:56,740
Scott: That's the right way to do it.

885
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:58,805
Rym: This game is just play a miniatures game.

886
01:07:58,906 --> 01:08:04,220
Rym: And also there will be probably hundreds and hundreds and hours of audio drama you can skip.

887
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:05,544
Scott: It's like, here's a miniatures game.

888
01:08:05,584 --> 01:08:07,630
Scott: And also this MP3 is on the side.

889
01:08:07,670 --> 01:08:09,114
Scott: It's like, they're not integrated in any way.

890
01:08:09,134 --> 01:08:11,000
Scott: You could just sell the MP3s by themselves.

891
01:08:11,808 --> 01:08:11,977
Rym: Yup.

892
01:08:13,382 --> 01:08:17,796
Scott: I guess the last thing is the, um, we got to talk about the, the pay to win part of it, right?

893
01:08:17,817 --> 01:08:18,700
Scott: The, the currencies.

894
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:27,578
Rym: Oh, and also I got to note, underworlds has announced that they expect the game to last a decade or longer and it may potentially go free to play in the future.

895
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:28,380
Rym: So be warned.

896
01:08:29,381 --> 01:08:29,622
Scott: Yeah.

897
01:08:29,642 --> 01:08:35,759
Scott: So, uh, you can get, there are currencies, you can get, there's different currencies, some, you know, whatever, right?

898
01:08:36,361 --> 01:08:42,680
Scott: Um, and you can use the currencies to either get cosmetic shit or to unlock, get boosters to unlock dudes.

899
01:08:43,060 --> 01:08:45,287
Scott: But once you unlock all the dudes, like you're good.

900
01:08:45,308 --> 01:08:48,557
Scott: There's different rarities of dudes, but that's just different models.

901
01:08:48,636 --> 01:08:49,600
Scott: It's just cosmetic, right?

902
01:08:49,861 --> 01:08:52,698
Rym: I mean, I'm going to dunk them all in one color of paint anyway, so.

903
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:54,081
Scott: Exactly.

904
01:08:54,862 --> 01:09:01,274
Scott: Uh, so then there, they had, they started off, when I started it, there was this cargo mode, right?

905
01:09:01,295 --> 01:09:04,140
Scott: And I'm like, what the hell is this cargo mode that everyone is angry about?

906
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:04,401
Scott: Right.

907
01:09:04,441 --> 01:09:07,768
Scott: Because there's a bunch of people who weren't interested in competitive play.

908
01:09:08,069 --> 01:09:11,917
Scott: They're just interested in like playing PvE and unlocking stuff.

909
01:09:11,957 --> 01:09:12,840
Scott: Like that's all they want to do.

910
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:13,541
Rym: You know, it's funny.

911
01:09:13,621 --> 01:09:14,943
Rym: The same thing happened with Overwatch.

912
01:09:14,983 --> 01:09:24,460
Rym: Part of Overwatch 2 is to be able to support all these people who just don't want to play against other people at all, but yet still want to play the game because they care about the lore or the cosmetics.

913
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:25,764
Scott: I don't think they care about the lore.

914
01:09:25,783 --> 01:09:30,200
Scott: I think people just like the, like this, like this feeling of unlocking stuff.

915
01:09:30,220 --> 01:09:37,140
Rym: There are definitely people who play Overwatch solely to unlock the cosmetics and like listen to the in-game dialogue.

916
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:40,024
Scott: And I'm like, I'm like, don't you enjoy playing the game?

917
01:09:40,163 --> 01:09:43,167
Scott: And they're like, no, it's like, I don't enjoy playing the game.

918
01:09:43,188 --> 01:09:44,890
Scott: And I'm like, then why are you playing it?

919
01:09:45,430 --> 01:09:48,935
Scott: It's like, it's like playing the game is its own reward.

920
01:09:48,996 --> 01:09:52,140
Scott: It's like, if that part is not enjoyable, don't do it.

921
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:58,320
Rym: Which once again, never trust anything where the story is 100% disentangled from the mechanics of the game.

922
01:09:59,121 --> 01:09:59,241
Scott: Yeah.

923
01:09:59,441 --> 01:10:03,808
Scott: Like I told that to someone, I said, I just posted in the discord of like the Moonbreaker discord.

924
01:10:03,848 --> 01:10:06,373
Scott: I'm like playing, I didn't like insult anyone.

925
01:10:06,393 --> 01:10:07,554
Scott: I was just like playing.

926
01:10:07,575 --> 01:10:08,957
Scott: the game is its own reward.

927
01:10:08,977 --> 01:10:10,800
Scott: I don't care about unlocking stuff.

928
01:10:11,421 --> 01:10:13,524
Scott: And someone was like, my brain doesn't work that way.

929
01:10:13,544 --> 01:10:16,449
Scott: And I didn't type this, but I wanted to say seek help.

930
01:10:16,870 --> 01:10:17,070
Scott: Right.

931
01:10:17,150 --> 01:10:21,718
Scott: It's like that's, um, but anyway, so they had this cargo mode.

932
01:10:21,738 --> 01:10:22,780
Scott: What is the cargo mode?

933
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:33,073
Scott: Well, when I started the game on the first day of early access, the way it worked is you would get cargo tickets and you get one cargo ticket for free every day, but you could buy more.

934
01:10:33,394 --> 01:10:33,674
Scott: Right.

935
01:10:34,235 --> 01:10:36,438
Scott: And because I bought the game, I got a few free ones.

936
01:10:36,618 --> 01:10:37,359
Scott: Just like a handful.

937
01:10:37,639 --> 01:10:38,240
Scott: I used one.

938
01:10:39,301 --> 01:10:42,067
Scott: And you pay a cargo ticket and you can play cargo mode.

939
01:10:42,107 --> 01:10:48,140
Scott: And what happens to cargo mode is you get an army of dudes and you fight the AI in a game.

940
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:52,208
Rym: So apparently they tried to make a campaign mode, but they found out they couldn't make it fun.

941
01:10:52,569 --> 01:10:56,116
Rym: They tried to make a PV mode, but they also found they couldn't make it fun.

942
01:10:56,456 --> 01:10:58,180
Rym: And they settled on this cargo mode.

943
01:10:58,821 --> 01:10:59,001
Scott: Right.

944
01:10:59,041 --> 01:11:04,470
Scott: So the cargo mode, the way it works is you drop into a fight against some AI and they're really easy.

945
01:11:04,911 --> 01:11:05,452
Scott: You beat them.

946
01:11:06,073 --> 01:11:10,040
Scott: And then you go into a fight against some harder AI after you beat the first one.

947
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:12,863
Scott: And it's like, I think it's six or seven battles in a row.

948
01:11:12,903 --> 01:11:17,148
Scott: If you never, if you never lose, but you're basically playing like the same deck.

949
01:11:17,549 --> 01:11:26,940
Scott: So it's like, if your guy dies, it's like, you know, it's like that's, you have this one army to beat six or seven, however many enemies in a row.

950
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:27,441
Scott: Right.

951
01:11:27,461 --> 01:11:28,122
Scott: Without losing.

952
01:11:29,384 --> 01:11:40,280
Scott: And it's like, that's, it's pretty tough actually to beat all of them, especially because starting with like the third or fourth one to make up for the fact that the AI is not any good at the game, the AI is cheating.

953
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:41,041
Scott: Right.

954
01:11:41,181 --> 01:11:46,973
Scott: It has units that are just like fire a laser and destroy all your dudes and shit, you know, ridiculous nonsense.

955
01:11:47,253 --> 01:11:47,514
Scott: Right.

956
01:11:47,975 --> 01:11:50,400
Scott: So you have to be really clever and perfect.

957
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:58,329
Scott: You know, always being out of range, using the right combination of abilities, et cetera, et cetera, in order to win.

958
01:11:58,609 --> 01:11:58,829
Scott: Right.

959
01:11:59,310 --> 01:12:00,751
Scott: And if you win, what do you get?

960
01:12:00,851 --> 01:12:03,234
Scott: Well, much like Hearthstone arenas, right?

961
01:12:03,615 --> 01:12:08,540
Scott: The further you get you, the more rewards you get in terms of currencies and other bonuses.

962
01:12:09,201 --> 01:12:21,231
Scott: So you're just basically spending this cargo ticket and then adding in some skill and strategy to get a payout of currencies and coins and other skins and cosmetic nonsense.

963
01:12:21,412 --> 01:12:21,592
Scott: Right.

964
01:12:22,973 --> 01:12:30,540
Scott: Uh, and so if you're a person who's only playing to unlock things and you don't enjoy playing, all you want to do is play this mode over and over again.

965
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:34,460
Rym: But you need those tickets to play that mode and you get like, what, one a day or something?

966
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:40,707
Scott: So you can play the game once a day without paying money for a game that you already paid money for because it's not a free game.

967
01:12:40,727 --> 01:12:41,548
Scott: Right.

968
01:12:42,049 --> 01:12:50,300
Scott: So people got hella mad at that and they said, all right, we're gonna, you know, basically get rid of the tickets so you can play cargo mode all you want.

969
01:12:50,781 --> 01:13:01,400
Scott: But we're gonna remove some of the rewards from the cargo mode so that you can't just play it forever and get a bunch of free, you know, shit that we're trying to charge money for.

970
01:13:02,922 --> 01:13:03,002
Scott: Yeah.

971
01:13:03,022 --> 01:13:05,407
Scott: Um, and so that's what they did so far.

972
01:13:06,269 --> 01:13:07,612
Scott: And I'm like, why?

973
01:13:07,712 --> 01:13:09,315
Scott: I don't even give a shit about the cargo mode.

974
01:13:09,335 --> 01:13:11,560
Scott: I played it once to see what it was and I'll never play it again.

975
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:17,407
Rym: Yeah, which is another worrying sign that they tried to make an adventure mode and a campaign and all these other modes with their core mechanics.

976
01:13:17,808 --> 01:13:28,040
Rym: But according to this article, they couldn't make any of them fun or replayable, which leads me to some worries about the fundamental mechanics of this game.

977
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:29,704
Scott: Well, I think that's just the problem.

978
01:13:29,724 --> 01:13:31,267
Scott: You know, we talked about forever.

979
01:13:31,347 --> 01:13:31,548
Scott: Right.

980
01:13:31,688 --> 01:13:33,051
Scott: You know, competitive and casual.

981
01:13:33,071 --> 01:13:35,356
Scott: It's like they're trying to appeal to two audiences.

982
01:13:35,757 --> 01:13:35,998
Scott: Right.

983
01:13:36,098 --> 01:13:37,020
Scott: With the same game.

984
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:39,706
Rym: You know, we've only ever done that panel at Magfest in person.

985
01:13:39,766 --> 01:13:42,994
Rym: It's one of our few like serious panels that's not on YouTube yet.

986
01:13:43,234 --> 01:13:44,538
Rym: We haven't done the definitive version.

987
01:13:45,219 --> 01:13:45,560
Scott: Interesting.

988
01:13:45,620 --> 01:13:46,161
Scott: Yeah.

989
01:13:46,601 --> 01:13:52,830
Scott: But it's like, it's like they put two completely separate games in the same piece of software that share some rules together.

990
01:13:52,850 --> 01:13:53,471
Scott: Right.

991
01:13:54,873 --> 01:13:57,056
Scott: And you know, they have nothing to do with each other.

992
01:13:57,136 --> 01:13:59,660
Scott: They're completely separate audiences who are at odds with each other.

993
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:01,705
Scott: One audience brings them a lot of money.

994
01:14:02,046 --> 01:14:03,812
Scott: The other one doesn't bring a lot of money.

995
01:14:03,832 --> 01:14:06,340
Scott: It just brings loyalty because they care about the game and want to win.

996
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:15,451
Rym: That second scene, the competitive scene for many games brings the esports and the alternative monetization streams if it gets big enough.

997
01:14:15,491 --> 01:14:22,680
Rym: Like you can see a world where Overwatch competitive only makes money from like the live streams and the merchandising and the professional play.

998
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:27,149
Rym: And casual players, they make money from them because they buy stuff in the game.

999
01:14:27,550 --> 01:14:31,700
Rym: So there is a way to monetize that, but that's difficult to monetize.

1000
01:14:32,881 --> 01:14:34,045
Scott: Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

1001
01:14:34,065 --> 01:14:36,553
Scott: That's another good reason to go to tournaments with entry fees.

1002
01:14:37,937 --> 01:14:38,900
Scott: You make money that way.

1003
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:53,740
Rym: The thesis of that panel that only people at Magfest have seen that we spent a lot of time on and I think we should do again someday with some tweaks was that you cannot, it is actually impossible to make a game that will appease competitive and casual players.

1004
01:14:54,721 --> 01:15:14,340
Scott: I also think that just regardless of what design decisions they make in this game in particular, that a miniatures game of this nature where there are two squads of units that fight until one of them is dead is that game is only going to be any good as a PvP one on one game.

1005
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:16,102
Scott: It's not going to work as a co-op game.

1006
01:15:16,462 --> 01:15:18,484
Scott: It's not going to work as a PvE game.

1007
01:15:18,825 --> 01:15:21,547
Scott: It's only going to work as a competitive game.

1008
01:15:21,587 --> 01:15:29,676
Scott: No matter what you do without making something drastically different will only ever appeal to a competitive audience.

1009
01:15:29,716 --> 01:15:33,600
Scott: It's not going to appeal to a single player audience of grinding and all that nonsense.

1010
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:49,420
Rym: If you did something which capitalism won't allow, if the game were like Advance Wars in that you had a campaign that was crafted so well to be fun to play with your deck against a long form campaign, they tried and failed to make a mode like that.

1011
01:15:51,101 --> 01:15:57,871
Scott: So yeah, so Moonbreaker as I guess the sum, the conclusion is that it's early access.

1012
01:15:58,091 --> 01:15:58,692
Scott: It could change.

1013
01:16:00,014 --> 01:16:04,040
Scott: The core concept is like gold almost platinum.

1014
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:06,108
Rym: Somebody is going to make a game like this.

1015
01:16:06,208 --> 01:16:07,012
Rym: It might be them.

1016
01:16:07,092 --> 01:16:09,100
Rym: It might be someone else that is going to be the one.

1017
01:16:09,701 --> 01:16:11,865
Scott: This is something that has not been done before.

1018
01:16:11,925 --> 01:16:13,788
Scott: Painting your own miniatures genius.

1019
01:16:14,329 --> 01:16:18,577
Scott: It's like a miniatures squad based multiplayer genius.

1020
01:16:18,617 --> 01:16:20,440
Scott: The core concept is unbelievable.

1021
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:30,260
Rym: But it's one poisoned by the capitalist need to monetize games in these toxic obfuscated randomized collectible exploitative ways.

1022
01:16:31,582 --> 01:16:34,285
Scott: And it needs a lot more.

1023
01:16:34,686 --> 01:16:40,012
Scott: It's surprisingly polished in many ways, but not polished enough.

1024
01:16:41,314 --> 01:16:46,140
Scott: This thing needs to be polished to Nintendo levels before it can be acceptable.

1025
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:48,905
Rym: And remember, you know how Nintendo does that polish?

1026
01:16:49,186 --> 01:16:53,394
Rym: They hire an absolute army of experts to do it.

1027
01:16:54,777 --> 01:16:56,240
Rym: There's a reason they don't make that many games.

1028
01:16:57,721 --> 01:17:01,430
Scott: It's like, I know I used it as thing of the day before, right?

1029
01:17:03,114 --> 01:17:03,956
Scott: But what's his name?

1030
01:17:04,217 --> 01:17:05,360
Scott: Has the YouTube channel?

1031
01:17:05,741 --> 01:17:07,559
Rym: Oh yeah, I'll link to it again I guess.

1032
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:09,390
Scott: Smash Brothers guy?

1033
01:17:09,894 --> 01:17:10,419
Scott: What's his name?

1034
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:13,219
Rym: Let me find his actual channel.

1035
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:15,733
Scott: Why can't I remember his name right now?

1036
01:17:15,853 --> 01:17:16,498
Scott: I'm going to feel real.

1037
01:17:18,061 --> 01:17:21,860
Rym: Masashiro Sakurai on Creating Games is the channel.

1038
01:17:23,281 --> 01:17:32,040
Scott: On Sakurai's YouTube channel, some of his videos have shown just some of these small details of polish that go into games.

1039
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:35,487
Scott: For example, there was one video he talked about pauses.

1040
01:17:36,169 --> 01:17:40,680
Scott: He's like, look, here's a game where when you die, you just die instantly.

1041
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:49,320
Scott: And here's a game where when an enemy bullet hits you, the game pauses for like a fraction of a second to emphasize each time you get hit.

1042
01:17:50,141 --> 01:17:51,244
Scott: He's like, see that?

1043
01:17:51,264 --> 01:17:56,060
Scott: It's like, if you're not a pro game developer, you don't know that, to do that in your games, right?

1044
01:17:56,780 --> 01:18:00,888
Scott: But it makes an enormous difference, and that's just one item of polish.

1045
01:18:00,908 --> 01:18:07,800
Scott: You have to know thousands of small details like that and incorporate them into your game to get it to the Nintendo level.

1046
01:18:08,140 --> 01:18:08,301
Rym: Yep.

1047
01:18:08,802 --> 01:18:13,600
Rym: And right now, you know, it's early access, so maybe we'll get there, but the game lacks most of that kind of polish.

1048
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:18,400
Rym: The mechanics are not polished, the UX is not polished, and like the graphics are not polished.

1049
01:18:19,883 --> 01:18:21,699
Scott: The graphics are polished in some ways.

1050
01:18:22,381 --> 01:18:26,100
Rym: They look great, they're just not functional as game graphics.

1051
01:18:26,580 --> 01:18:32,757
Scott: Yes, it is form over function polish, but some of the function is great, but there's function missing.

1052
01:18:32,817 --> 01:18:33,780
Scott: that is, you know.

1053
01:18:34,361 --> 01:18:40,039
Scott: So anyway, I remain hopeful because this is very close to my alley, you know.

1054
01:18:40,380 --> 01:18:44,400
Scott: It's not a strike, but it is, you know, it's maybe a spare, right?

1055
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:53,560
Rym: I have to say, a game like this would be fantastic in VR as well, if you're just sitting at a table looking at it in VR and moving the pieces around with your hands.

1056
01:18:53,780 --> 01:18:55,659
Scott: Oh, you mean like an ARG kind of deal?

1057
01:18:56,180 --> 01:18:59,760
Scott: Where you have an actual table but no miniatures, and then you can actually move them?

1058
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:00,779
Rym: That would be great.

1059
01:19:01,243 --> 01:19:03,520
Scott: What about ARG VR Paint the Miniatures?

1060
01:19:05,403 --> 01:19:12,040
Rym: Oh, see, well, uh, I don't think anyone's done anything like that, I gotta make sure.

1061
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:16,000
Scott: There was that one where you could like paint a big blob in 3D in VR, right?

1062
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:20,420
Rym: Oh yeah, you could definitely do something like that, I was trying to think if anyone has done anything even remotely like this.

1063
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:29,160
Rym: There have been a handful of meh VR games that are like, here's a big miniature driven tabletop-y kind of game, but they're not, they're not this kind of game.

1064
01:19:31,121 --> 01:19:36,520
Scott: Yeah, I'm talking like, you know, actually like careful, slow painting of small things in VR.

1065
01:19:36,940 --> 01:19:45,300
Rym: Or never mind, like honestly, moving the guys, like the UX could almost be better in VR than it is on a desktop for a game like this, if done well.

1066
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:56,080
Rym: Because then you avoid the problem of everything blends in with everything because it's almost rendered like they're real 3D components, but because of the angle you're looking- Yeah, you would see the unit sticking up out of the table better.

1067
01:19:56,200 --> 01:20:05,200
Rym: Yeah, because the problem is they designed it like that, but then when you look at it in game, you're looking from this angle that flattens everything out and everything's just a flat, just mess of pixels.

1068
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:15,200
Rym: It's a little, I mean it's 3D, but it's- Yeah, but like look at it, like take the screen up, open your eyes, look at it for a few seconds, close your eyes and try to remember where fucking anything is.

1069
01:20:16,201 --> 01:20:20,480
Scott: I think what they, they would have just made a hex map instead of the free movement, you know?

1070
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:24,993
Rym: Yeah, but the free movement is one of the few things I'm actually really interested in, like.

1071
01:20:25,013 --> 01:20:27,520
Rym: I feel like that's important to this game being worth playing at all.

1072
01:20:27,580 --> 01:20:30,940
Scott: It could be smaller, it doesn't have to be big ol' Battletech hexes, it can be smaller ones.

1073
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:31,421
Rym: Nah.

1074
01:20:32,507 --> 01:20:34,500
Rym: Or just light highlighting of characters.

1075
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:37,700
Scott: It's some sort of discreteness, such to give the movement discreteness, right?

1076
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:44,875
Rym: You need some 2D aura highlighting on the 3D characters based on your angle of view to make them pop.

1077
01:20:44,935 --> 01:20:47,560
Rym: Nothing pops from the UI, that's one of the biggest problems.

1078
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:48,738
Rym: Like nothing pops.

1079
01:20:49,783 --> 01:20:51,299
Rym: We beat this horse to death, so.

1080
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:57,060
Scott: Hopefully, hopefully, you know, this game can, you know, it's come this far, it's still early access.

1081
01:20:57,260 --> 01:21:01,160
Rym: I'm not giving up on it, I'm gonna try to make the best deck I can and I'm gonna play it occasionally.

1082
01:21:01,660 --> 01:21:07,220
Scott: Yeah, I played in a tournament, I plan to try again, I lost obviously every match, I plan to try again.

1083
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:10,940
Scott: You know, I'm gonna, when I get some time, right?

1084
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:15,580
Rym: I'm gonna play this the way I played Magic as a kid, I'm gonna keep looking at who won tournaments, copy their decks.

1085
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:17,122
Scott: Yeah, that's what I did.

1086
01:21:17,202 --> 01:21:24,540
Scott: And also, the, when it's, I think the line I'm gonna decide whether to go in on this game is gonna happen when it leaves early access.

1087
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:31,339
Scott: We'll see what state it is in at that point, and if it's in a good state, then I'll go in on it, and if not, I'll be like, "Well, it was, it was a

1088
01:21:31,379 --> 01:21:31,580
Scott: try.".

1089
01:21:32,641 --> 01:21:47,680
Rym: And you know, if nothing else, Brendan Sanderson fans, even if this game is a complete flop, you'll probably be able to find an archive of the, probably hundreds of MP3s they're gonna record, that are the audio, like, story of this universe.

1090
01:21:50,665 --> 01:21:50,755
Scott: Okay.

1091
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:54,746
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1092
01:21:54,787 --> 01:21:59,780
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1093
01:22:00,141 --> 01:22:05,180
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1094
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:08,107
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1095
01:22:08,247 --> 01:22:12,840
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1096
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:17,208
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1097
01:22:17,648 --> 01:22:20,714
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1098
01:22:20,915 --> 01:22:23,800
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1099
01:22:24,401 --> 01:22:31,840
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this particular episode of GeekNights are Alan Dreslin, Kijie, Dredlin, and Tinebrae on a bunch of Bepple who rarely don't want me to say their names.

1100
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:40,237
Rym: Kasekare makes music, Chris of Dodd, Chris, Grimer, Clinton Walton, Dex, Finn, Rebecca Dunn, Sam Erickson, Sherwin Von Horl.

1101
01:22:40,538 --> 01:22:41,520
Rym: Stop all the downloading.

1102
01:22:41,860 --> 01:22:44,746
Rym: The next station is Finch West, Finch West Station.

1103
01:22:45,187 --> 01:22:51,840
Rym: And a lot of people are very wisely giving us, like, less than $5 a month for the podcast that is just free on the internet.

1104
01:22:52,361 --> 01:22:58,793
Rym: So yeah, it's a shame that Discord's YouTube Together thing is just completely worthless.

1105
01:22:59,214 --> 01:23:02,140
Rym: We have discovered this, so spread the word, we'll see if they fix it.

1106
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:09,620
Rym: But for now, I simply leave you with... He's saying he's like Short Circuit.

1107
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:10,002
Rym: Mm-mm.

1108
01:23:10,327 --> 01:23:11,160
Rym: Nothing like Short Circuit.

1109
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:13,059
Rym: Yeah, I was gonna say, he's nothing like Short Circuit.

1110
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:14,940
Scott: I'm just like Short Circuit or Gremlins.

1111
01:23:15,180 --> 01:23:16,780
Scott: Hold on a second, let me look through this rulebook.

1112
01:23:17,022 --> 01:23:18,359
Rym: I wanna go to the bridge.

1113
01:23:18,580 --> 01:23:19,838
Scott: Why didn't you give me the book?

1114
01:23:20,082 --> 01:23:20,980
Scott: I only have one copy.

1115
01:23:21,222 --> 01:23:22,937
Scott: I wanna go to the bridge on the 15th Street.

1116
01:23:23,260 --> 01:23:24,979
Scott: Can you, like, copy the book and send it to me?

1117
01:23:25,140 --> 01:23:26,540
Scott: It's a big book, it'll take forever.

1118
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:29,560
Scott: Take me to the bridge, please, at 15th and Olive.

1119
01:23:29,780 --> 01:23:30,940
Rym: No, do not take him to the bridge.

1120
01:23:31,143 --> 01:23:31,658
Scott: What do you mean no?

1121
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:35,475
Scott: Uh, it says here he has a quest and you cannot let him complete it.

1122
01:23:35,495 --> 01:23:36,580
Rym: Do not let him complete the quest.

1123
01:23:36,801 --> 01:23:37,640
Scott: It has a quest!

1124
01:23:38,042 --> 01:23:40,020
Scott: I have a quest and I will complete it.

1125
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:41,580
Rym: Tell me again how this is like a Gremlin.

1126
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:42,440
Rym: It's like the one difference.

1127
01:23:42,842 --> 01:23:44,080
Rym: I have to fight the Mole Man.

1128
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:45,720
Rym: What happens if he completes his quest?

1129
01:23:45,921 --> 01:23:46,880
Scott: He has my toothbrush.

1130
01:23:47,041 --> 01:23:48,440
Scott: As far as you know, there is no quest.

1131
01:23:48,541 --> 01:23:50,719
Scott: As far as I know, you told me he has a quest.

1132
01:23:51,020 --> 01:23:52,619
Scott: Now I'm not gonna stop thinking about his quest.

1133
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:54,900
Scott: There's no quest, there's no Mole Man, there's no toothbrush.

1134
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:55,811
Rym: I want an iPad.

1135
01:23:55,831 --> 01:23:56,378
Rym: Buy me an iPad.

1136
01:23:56,580 --> 01:23:57,328
Rym: He wants an iPad.

1137
01:23:57,368 --> 01:23:58,500
Scott: I don't have an iPad.

1138
01:23:58,760 --> 01:23:59,227
Scott: Oh, that's new.

1139
01:23:59,511 --> 01:24:00,080
Scott: I haven't heard that yet.

1140
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:01,040
Rym: Get me an iPad, please.

1141
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:04,360
Scott: I have, like, a second generation one somewhere, but it's, like, broken.

1142
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:05,860
Scott: Let's watch Terms of Endearment.

1143
01:24:06,082 --> 01:24:06,679
Scott: I don't know what that is.

1144
01:24:06,901 --> 01:24:08,400
Rym: I need to find a plastic surgeon.

1145
01:24:08,540 --> 01:24:09,240
Rym: He wants surgery.

1146
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:12,220
Rym: I'm one surgery away from perfection.

1147
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:13,699
Scott: No, don't let him do that, actually, no.
