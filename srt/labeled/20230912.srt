00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,331
Rym: It's Tuesday, September 12th, 2023.

2
00:00:12,331 --> 00:00:12,772
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,792 --> 00:00:17,327
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight Something we haven't done in a long time.

4
00:00:17,348 --> 00:00:18,393
Rym: We're gonna review a con.

5
00:00:18,413 --> 00:00:19,819
Rym: We're talking about PAX West.

6
00:00:23,862 --> 00:00:24,877
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:26,441 --> 00:00:27,605
Scott: So it's pretty rare.

8
00:00:27,665 --> 00:00:32,439
Scott: We get a legendary opening bit or maybe it just feels that way because of the dark times.

9
00:00:32,781 --> 00:00:37,125
Scott: Yep, yep, but I have a a legendary Open e bit.

10
00:00:37,185 --> 00:00:40,600
Scott: legendary a hellish a hellish open e bit.

11
00:00:41,781 --> 00:00:47,878
Scott: So he went to PAX and the weekend immediately following packs was my sister's wedding.

12
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:53,614
Scott: not in Chicago where her spouse lit his family lives.

13
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:55,040
Scott: they live in LA but yeah.

14
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:55,841
Rym: So fun fact.

15
00:00:56,062 --> 00:00:59,948
Rym: of the last three times I have tried to go to Chicago in my life.

16
00:01:00,188 --> 00:01:00,669
Rym: No joke.

17
00:01:00,749 --> 00:01:01,170
Rym: No exaggeration.

18
00:01:01,391 --> 00:01:06,730
Rym: Two of them the flights were fucked up so badly that I gave up and just didn't go.

19
00:01:07,352 --> 00:01:12,130
Scott: Well, I have never before even attempted to go to Chicago in my life, right?

20
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,029
Scott: Not even an attempt at any previous point in time.

21
00:01:16,253 --> 00:01:18,426
Scott: Not a place that I would mind going right.

22
00:01:18,446 --> 00:01:26,814
Scott: there was some stuff I wanted to see there right and so the wedding was Sunday night and my flight was Friday night.

23
00:01:26,934 --> 00:01:27,476
Scott: ish, right.

24
00:01:27,536 --> 00:01:37,450
Scott: and I was like I could have gone from PAX to Chicago or stayed in Seattle and then gone to Chicago Or something like that, but it was like the hotel nights in between.

25
00:01:38,152 --> 00:01:43,050
Scott: You know Seattle and yeah, Chicago would have been very expensive.

26
00:01:43,211 --> 00:01:50,070
Scott: it was actually cheaper to destroy the environment and Take four flights instead of three plus minimal gain.

27
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:57,579
Rym: it's not like when we stayed around Boston and New Hampshire between PAX East and Anime Boston that one time I could have done stuff it.

28
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,130
Scott: I could have done things in Chicago if I stayed there a week.

29
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:00,896
Scott: I've never been there.

30
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:02,187
Scott: I'm sure there's things to do there.

31
00:02:02,308 --> 00:02:13,374
Scott: I saw Alright and so I went back to New York and then just a few days later I attempted to go to Chicago on Friday night and Load bearing word there.

32
00:02:13,394 --> 00:02:14,457
Rym: You just said the word attempted.

33
00:02:14,978 --> 00:02:17,045
Scott: Oh, yeah, they said it's a hellish story.

34
00:02:17,145 --> 00:02:17,867
Scott: It's not a spoiler.

35
00:02:18,228 --> 00:02:19,428
Scott: Come on It's.

36
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:24,242
Scott: Where did you think the story was going when I said hellish?

37
00:02:24,262 --> 00:02:28,820
Scott: to start to talk about planes, okay So go to LaGuardia and our flight is.

38
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,210
Scott: so it's like everything's looking good, right?

39
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:35,330
Scott: You know, there's a hurricane out in the ocean, but that's we're not going that way and still not here yet.

40
00:02:35,451 --> 00:02:37,370
Scott: So, you know, that's not a problem.

41
00:02:37,792 --> 00:02:42,570
Scott: There are some thunderstorms, but they're like over to the west so we should both like fly over them, right?

42
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:43,695
Scott: I don't fuck know how that works.

43
00:02:43,715 --> 00:02:44,137
Scott: I'm not a pie.

44
00:02:44,157 --> 00:02:44,800
Scott: I don't anything about.

45
00:02:45,061 --> 00:02:46,870
Scott: you know, plain weather, whatever.

46
00:02:48,474 --> 00:02:51,170
Scott: And I guess I know that ice on the wings is bad, but it was not cold.

47
00:02:51,411 --> 00:02:52,758
Scott: It's the very opposite of cold.

48
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,869
Scott: So that's not the issue anyway.

49
00:02:57,431 --> 00:03:02,710
Scott: So we're waiting for the as soon as we like get to LaGuardia like, you know, we're just getting over there, right?

50
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:05,079
Scott: Suddenly the status changes to delay.

51
00:03:05,361 --> 00:03:06,970
Scott: It's like well, all right.

52
00:03:07,311 --> 00:03:12,210
Scott: I think I actually know that might have the first delay might have been as soon as we closed the door and left the apartment.

53
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:17,107
Scott: Regardless it was that close to the wire that the delay started appearing.

54
00:03:17,247 --> 00:03:17,890
Scott: It's like, all right.

55
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,320
Scott: Well, you know, it's not much of a delay.

56
00:03:20,943 --> 00:03:21,826
Scott: What are we doing today?

57
00:03:21,887 --> 00:03:22,670
Scott: Nothing, right?

58
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,609
Scott: It's like let's go over there make sure nothing gets fucked up, right?

59
00:03:26,451 --> 00:03:39,287
Scott: you know we get there and we sit down and we're looking at the gate and it gets delayed again and delayed again and Then canceled because the plane that was gonna take us to Chicago was not going to reach LaGuardia.

60
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:51,770
Scott: So We're like, okay So I go to get in line to talk to the person and figure out what the fuck to do And I get in line I get in line I get to the first of all.

61
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:55,430
Scott: I'd get standby for the next flight right on the phone obviously, right?

62
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:59,928
Scott: But I'm like way down in line right like 11th or something like that, right?

63
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:06,720
Scott: So And it's I'm like, alright, I start asking them all the questions cuz you know I'm sure other experienced travelers have had this happen.

64
00:04:07,022 --> 00:04:08,990
Scott: I have literally never had a flight canceled.

65
00:04:10,136 --> 00:04:12,637
Rym: I have had this happen Several times.

66
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:16,379
Rym: there was when I got to meet the Bundespolize in Frankfurt.

67
00:04:16,762 --> 00:04:21,822
Scott: as a result of that I have never had a canceled flight and also this wasn't just like.

68
00:04:21,902 --> 00:04:28,090
Scott: if it was PAX even I would have been like, alright I'll just go to PAX a day late or I'll just skip this PAX, right?

69
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,840
Scott: It's like, you know, not the end of the world, right?

70
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,045
Scott: There's another PAX next year.

71
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,510
Scott: It's like sister's wedding.

72
00:04:33,611 --> 00:04:34,808
Scott: It's like I'm going to Chicago.

73
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,196
Scott: It's like we're going.

74
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:39,244
Scott: we're gonna get there, right?

75
00:04:39,586 --> 00:04:40,750
Scott: So I had to go wait in the line.

76
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:43,164
Scott: I get to the front of the line and I'm like, alright, he's like.

77
00:04:43,405 --> 00:04:44,190
Scott: I'm like, what would you do?

78
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,118
Scott: He's like I would wait and stand by for the next flight.

79
00:04:46,138 --> 00:04:48,770
Scott: He's like a lot of people are gonna bail on that flight.

80
00:04:49,272 --> 00:04:50,388
Scott: It's still on time.

81
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,350
Scott: Right, you're gonna be you know, you have a good chance of getting on it.

82
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:57,605
Scott: And if you don't well then you can worry about that when it happens.

83
00:04:57,646 --> 00:04:58,530
Scott: It's just a few hours.

84
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:01,250
Scott: Yeah, and I'm like, I'm like, alright, well, I checked a bag.

85
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:01,792
Scott: It's like.

86
00:05:01,832 --> 00:05:02,455
Scott: is that bag?

87
00:05:02,515 --> 00:05:04,623
Scott: if I make it on the standby flight are the bag?

88
00:05:04,664 --> 00:05:07,094
Scott: people outside, you know I'm not gonna find out.

89
00:05:07,134 --> 00:05:10,390
Scott: I get on the standby flight until like close to the time it takes off, right?

90
00:05:10,691 --> 00:05:14,485
Scott: So are the bag people gonna go get my bag from wherever it is and throw it on?

91
00:05:14,525 --> 00:05:17,396
Rym: that player is what they told you Because I have a heuristic for that.

92
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:18,340
Scott: Yeah.

93
00:05:18,441 --> 00:05:19,706
Scott: So what he told me was your.

94
00:05:19,907 --> 00:05:22,410
Scott: if that happens Yes, the bag will get to Chicago.

95
00:05:22,972 --> 00:05:28,810
Scott: But it will probably get to Chicago like later and you'll have to go to the airport to retrieve it with your little claim ticket.

96
00:05:29,253 --> 00:05:29,778
Scott: And so I'm like.

97
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:30,322
Scott: so I'm like.

98
00:05:30,342 --> 00:05:31,330
Scott: so I'll be in Chicago.

99
00:05:31,611 --> 00:05:32,554
Scott: I'll go to the hotel.

100
00:05:32,574 --> 00:05:34,602
Scott: I'll have to wait for some notification.

101
00:05:35,123 --> 00:05:36,930
Scott: go an hour back to the airport.

102
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:41,983
Rym: Right, but you believe I once bought clothes for an event when I landed.

103
00:05:42,004 --> 00:05:44,230
Scott: There's a reason this clothing stores and all the airports.

104
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:44,973
Scott: Yeah, right.

105
00:05:44,993 --> 00:05:47,907
Rym: I know the most expensive fucking shirt I ever bought in my life.

106
00:05:48,067 --> 00:05:48,650
Rym: What didn't even write.

107
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:51,501
Scott: It's like I'm like the suit and the dress for the wedding.

108
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:52,484
Scott: They're in the luggage.

109
00:05:52,645 --> 00:05:53,870
Scott: I need I need the bag.

110
00:05:54,131 --> 00:05:55,939
Scott: It's not gonna work if I don't get that right.

111
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:58,150
Scott: am I gonna go clothes shopping tomorrow at a fancy?

112
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,357
Scott: It's like that's not good, right?

113
00:05:59,398 --> 00:06:08,367
Scott: I need that bag and I'm like alright, so What if I have the bag sent to the carousel and then I get on the standby flight.

114
00:06:08,507 --> 00:06:09,330
Scott: Can I run down?

115
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:12,144
Scott: Oh, by the way, LaGuardia, the security was instantaneous.

116
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,210
Scott: There was no line whatsoever.

117
00:06:13,472 --> 00:06:16,796
Rym: Anyways, I haven't been to the new LaGuardia yet I bring.

118
00:06:16,857 --> 00:06:18,090
Scott: it was literally no line.

119
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:21,503
Scott: Like I just walked through and I peep and then I threw my bag in.

120
00:06:21,523 --> 00:06:23,029
Scott: the thing went through the whatever.

121
00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:24,115
Scott: there I'm in the end.

122
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,169
Scott: Anyway, so I'm like, alright you send the bag down there.

123
00:06:29,953 --> 00:06:33,350
Scott: What if I go get it and then check it in for the standby flight?

124
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:40,026
Scott: He's like, well, that'll be good if you get on the standby flight But if you don't the bag will go to Chicago without you.

125
00:06:40,046 --> 00:06:44,610
Scott: Yeah Right, you'll basically be paying us 30 bucks to ship your bag to Chicago.

126
00:06:45,053 --> 00:06:47,907
Scott: Yeah, right, but not ship you to Chicago You know.

127
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:53,690
Rym: But that is where because I have the work status just cuz I fly so much the fact that I can just check bags free.

128
00:06:53,750 --> 00:07:00,082
Rym: Is that is the thing I usually do in that situation because if I end up not traveling The airline has to get it back to me at some point.

129
00:07:00,143 --> 00:07:01,049
Rym: I can live without the bag.

130
00:07:01,432 --> 00:07:05,881
Scott: But I mean if the bag was in Chicago and I got some other flight there I could go to the airport at the bag.

131
00:07:06,163 --> 00:07:08,476
Scott: The bag would be there first Not the biggest deal.

132
00:07:08,496 --> 00:07:11,370
Rym: and if I don't make it don't make it to Chicago at all.

133
00:07:11,712 --> 00:07:15,390
Rym: Then you were fucked anyway, and you didn't need that suit and it's gonna make it back to you.

134
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,181
Scott: Well, I need all the shit in the bag though.

135
00:07:17,524 --> 00:07:18,449
Scott: I need that bag back.

136
00:07:18,913 --> 00:07:22,168
Scott: I need to ship that get it shipped back to me Eventually.

137
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:24,513
Scott: I need it.

138
00:07:24,814 --> 00:07:25,677
Scott: I need it with me.

139
00:07:25,697 --> 00:07:25,897
Scott: All right.

140
00:07:26,018 --> 00:07:38,437
Scott: Anyway, so I'm like, well, that's not gonna be very good Right, and then I see that the standby flight is delayed and I'm like and I see all these other flights getting delayed And I'm like this shit gonna be canceled.

141
00:07:38,477 --> 00:07:39,541
Scott: I know it is I know.

142
00:07:39,581 --> 00:07:43,372
Scott: so I'm like, oh, so I'm just like send our bag downstairs Right.

143
00:07:43,854 --> 00:07:48,069
Scott: I'm just gonna buy another flight from wherever I can buy a flight from and I'll worry about this later.

144
00:07:48,109 --> 00:07:51,906
Rym: now There's the danger if I'll if one flight gets delayed like that happens.

145
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:55,700
Rym: if a bunch of flights on the same carrier get delayed that also happens.

146
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,483
Rym: get a different carrier.

147
00:07:56,824 --> 00:08:06,970
Rym: if a bunch of flights across a bunch of Different carriers all get delayed simultaneously in my experience That means you're fucked and you want to get the fuck out of that Airport and like you're you did is bad news.

148
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,497
Scott: Apparently over the weekend, right?

149
00:08:09,677 --> 00:08:14,230
Scott: There were over four thousand delays and cancellations at the New York airports.

150
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,463
Scott: Yeah, so anyway, it was.

151
00:08:16,523 --> 00:08:17,750
Scott: it was all the airports, right?

152
00:08:18,011 --> 00:08:19,235
Scott: They set a laguardia.

153
00:08:19,275 --> 00:08:22,023
Scott: The only reason they gave was air traffic control.

154
00:08:22,405 --> 00:08:24,090
Scott: Yeah, they didn't say any other reason, right?

155
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,199
Scott: It's like they didn't give any details or anything.

156
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,870
Scott: It's like why don't you like just tell me that all the information?

157
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:30,230
Scott: It's like it's not gonna change anything.

158
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:39,852
Rym: so like I just like to know if it's you gather that the Carrier like the government will say and the carriers will then say what the government said, but if the carriers fuck up They ain't saying anything.

159
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,484
Scott: No, no, but I'm saying it's like if they say the read.

160
00:08:42,524 --> 00:08:44,070
Scott: the reason was air traffic control.

161
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:44,412
Scott: It's like.

162
00:08:44,795 --> 00:08:46,750
Scott: well show me the report from air traffic control.

163
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:47,632
Scott: I just curious.

164
00:08:47,713 --> 00:08:53,830
Scott: right like it's there's a storm in this location and therefore this flight path is unsafe because of it.

165
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:54,071
Scott: Right.

166
00:08:54,091 --> 00:08:56,043
Scott: Just give me I'm not an expert.

167
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,230
Scott: I don't you know know anything.

168
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:06,410
Rym: Why not if your subway stops this subway that the conductor always gets on he's like, yeah We're stuck because of and he tells you why and the only time exactly.

169
00:09:08,035 --> 00:09:10,843
Scott: Give me a more a better explanation in three words.

170
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,050
Scott: Yeah, it's like it doesn't change anything the fly.

171
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:13,993
Scott: No, I'm not going.

172
00:09:14,194 --> 00:09:18,128
Scott: I can't argue that air traffic controllers into letting the flight go.

173
00:09:18,148 --> 00:09:21,939
Scott: I know that But it's I'm not expecting any different result.

174
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,084
Scott: I just want to know.

175
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:29,028
Scott: right I deserve, you know I feel like people deserve explanations even if the result is not any different.

176
00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:29,370
Rym: general.

177
00:09:30,031 --> 00:09:31,436
Scott: Yes, so we try.

178
00:09:31,456 --> 00:09:33,624
Scott: we see that there is a jet blue flight, right?

179
00:09:33,664 --> 00:09:35,230
Scott: I know Rym's not happy with the jet blue.

180
00:09:35,692 --> 00:09:38,083
Rym: I mean, they are the worst performing airline in America.

181
00:09:38,565 --> 00:09:39,047
Scott: They're trying to.

182
00:09:39,067 --> 00:09:39,710
Scott: there's a whole drama.

183
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,610
Scott: They're trying to buy spirits.

184
00:09:40,711 --> 00:09:41,156
Scott: So I try.

185
00:09:41,217 --> 00:09:44,076
Scott: I see there's a jet blue flight Crackadon the next day and I'm like.

186
00:09:44,296 --> 00:09:46,062
Scott: so I'm on my phone trying to buy it.

187
00:09:46,504 --> 00:09:50,329
Scott: trying to book a flight on your phone Sucks ass I die.

188
00:09:50,972 --> 00:09:55,570
Rym: I do not know how people live with just a phone because I don't know how they do it.

189
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:59,750
Scott: Like I had to fill out this whole web form with names addresses all this shit.

190
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:09,876
Rym: Yeah, right like when I like in flights I got like Delta in one tab and then I've got like my calendar and Google Maps in another browser open at the same time because I'm like I could have busted out.

191
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:18,672
Scott: I was trying to bust out the iPad because it was so difficult anyway, but yeah, I tried to book that flight several times and I got.

192
00:10:18,732 --> 00:10:19,555
Scott: at first I got.

193
00:10:19,695 --> 00:10:24,773
Scott: there were only seats left for the extra money, you know, the legroom seats, but I'm like, yes Yes.

194
00:10:24,853 --> 00:10:27,090
Scott: Yeah, let's let's get whatever's on here, right?

195
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:31,832
Scott: You know and I try to book them and I get to the end and I say give me that seat I got it.

196
00:10:32,113 --> 00:10:35,665
Scott: All right, and then it said hey someone got those seats.

197
00:10:35,725 --> 00:10:36,086
Scott: Sorry.

198
00:10:36,126 --> 00:10:37,330
Scott: I'm like, I'm like, what do you mean?

199
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:37,973
Scott: Why did you let?

200
00:10:38,254 --> 00:10:40,524
Scott: shouldn't you have reserved them when I was in the process?

201
00:10:40,544 --> 00:10:41,850
Scott: Like even Ticketmaster does that?

202
00:10:42,171 --> 00:10:42,777
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

203
00:10:42,878 --> 00:10:44,009
Rym: That is that is JetBlue.

204
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:48,290
Scott: Yeah, wait, so here it gets even worse than that, right?

205
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:50,196
Scott: So then I go back in again.

206
00:10:50,437 --> 00:10:55,975
Scott: those same seats are still fucking lit up, but I can pick them even though JetBlue see it's not.

207
00:10:56,276 --> 00:10:58,225
Rym: I am at a JetBlue one not just because they're.

208
00:10:58,326 --> 00:10:58,446
Scott: oh.

209
00:10:58,567 --> 00:11:01,459
Scott: and by the way It didn't just send me back to the seat picker.

210
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,804
Scott: It sent me back to the beginning.

211
00:11:02,824 --> 00:11:04,229
Scott: I had to fill out the forms again.

212
00:11:05,712 --> 00:11:08,350
Scott: So anyway, I felt the forms again on my phone.

213
00:11:08,471 --> 00:11:16,384
Scott: I picked the two seats in front of the two I picked last time Right, and then I try to pay and it like basically just doesn't work.

214
00:11:16,665 --> 00:11:19,822
Scott: I just get like a white page and Nothing happens.

215
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:22,872
Scott: Alright.

216
00:11:23,033 --> 00:11:31,518
Scott: and so then we try again and we use PayPal this time instead of credit card number, right and This time the PayPal goes through.

217
00:11:31,619 --> 00:11:45,245
Scott: we get a email from PayPal money taken $900 right and then we don't get any email from JetBlue and we don't have any tickets Right, and then I try one more time flights full.

218
00:11:46,858 --> 00:11:52,382
Scott: So we're not on that flight We are the PayPal money will come back because basically that happens.

219
00:11:52,422 --> 00:11:53,766
Rym: even take off for Chicago.

220
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:54,367
Rym: or is that all?

221
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:56,604
Scott: it was early enough in The morning, I think it actually did.

222
00:11:56,625 --> 00:12:01,604
Scott: Yeah So I go to the I'm like, alright fuck all this right?

223
00:12:01,665 --> 00:12:03,150
Scott: I'm looking at you know, the other options.

224
00:12:03,231 --> 00:12:11,830
Scott: I basically filter two people Non-stop flights to Chicago tomorrow, right and I see there's a Delta flight, but it's late in the afternoon.

225
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:17,032
Scott: It's like, you know, I'm like, it's like four and I'm like I wanted the early one in case shit goes down Right.

226
00:12:17,092 --> 00:12:17,794
Scott: I got all day.

227
00:12:17,914 --> 00:12:18,797
Scott: That's the thing right?

228
00:12:19,178 --> 00:12:22,870
Scott: But the only one that had any seats was that afternoon one, right?

229
00:12:23,391 --> 00:12:25,301
Scott: So I'm like, well, I guess that's what we got to do.

230
00:12:25,321 --> 00:12:26,870
Scott: We don't have some other choice here, right?

231
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,098
Scott: I didn't even see anything in Newark.

232
00:12:28,521 --> 00:12:34,630
Rym: So well, you know Your New Yorker is desperate when they even think about taking this flight out of Newark.

233
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:44,310
Scott: Some other people who had similar problems who went to the same wedding from New York did go to Newark But I think they were able to do that because they were one person and two people right anyway.

234
00:12:45,032 --> 00:12:52,922
Scott: So I go and we go to JFK and they were in terminal for again for the second time in that week at least for me.

235
00:12:54,251 --> 00:12:58,264
Scott: And we're waiting and the flight says on time right and I'm looking to some other flights.

236
00:12:58,284 --> 00:13:00,190
Scott: I'm seeing delays of seeing cancellations.

237
00:13:00,653 --> 00:13:10,800
Scott: I'm seeing people get bumped and be offered $1,600 to get off right, but I'm like man, I would love, you know, not our flight But some other flights were doing the bumping.

238
00:13:10,841 --> 00:13:14,564
Scott: Yeah, right and I'm like, man I would wish I get bumped on the way home, right?

239
00:13:14,604 --> 00:13:15,630
Scott: That would be right.

240
00:13:15,751 --> 00:13:18,446
Scott: I would take that if they said a thousand they started at a thousand.

241
00:13:18,466 --> 00:13:21,137
Scott: they worked up to 1600 before they got enough people bummed.

242
00:13:21,157 --> 00:13:25,153
Scott: Yeah, I still think the law would have taken that if I was in Chicago already trying to Get home.

243
00:13:25,456 --> 00:13:26,950
Scott: I would have taken the thousand immediately.

244
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:32,894
Rym: The law should be if a flight if someone's gonna get bumped they got to keep raising the price until someone accepts That's it.

245
00:13:32,935 --> 00:13:33,480
Scott: That's what they did.

246
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,549
Scott: That's exactly what they did.

247
00:13:34,671 --> 00:13:36,729
Scott: They're like, we'll give you a thousand dollars if you get off.

248
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:42,974
Scott: They said they were like they sit and they said how many people they're like, we need five people to leave We need three.

249
00:13:43,034 --> 00:13:43,897
Scott: All right, we they're like.

250
00:13:44,118 --> 00:13:45,624
Scott: we now need three people to leave.

251
00:13:45,664 --> 00:13:47,512
Scott: We're raising it to 1500.

252
00:13:47,512 --> 00:13:51,037
Scott: You know, I need one person to leave 1600.

253
00:13:51,037 --> 00:13:54,350
Scott: I guess the computer figures out how much they're supposed to offer right for them.

254
00:13:54,471 --> 00:13:57,530
Rym: See I say they have to raise it no matter what they did.

255
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,861
Scott: They raised it until they bumped off the phone.

256
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:01,449
Rym: They can't just bump people and just.

257
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:03,756
Rym: Well, that's what they did though, so it was fine.

258
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:11,306
Scott: It was some sort of reverse paying auction, you know to pay people to get off the plane.

259
00:14:11,326 --> 00:14:12,049
Scott: It wasn't our plane.

260
00:14:12,089 --> 00:14:14,235
Scott: regardless Says on time.

261
00:14:14,315 --> 00:14:15,480
Scott: our plane is never delayed.

262
00:14:15,681 --> 00:14:17,870
Scott: other planes around are getting delayed, right?

263
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:28,592
Scott: I can't see out the windows in that particular area of the terminal So I can't tell if planes are taking off or landing But I see people getting off of planes and coming into the terminal or a. there's some activity Right.

264
00:14:28,913 --> 00:14:30,799
Scott: Our our flight is still on time.

265
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:31,703
Scott: The crew is there.

266
00:14:32,184 --> 00:14:40,690
Scott: we get on the plane on time Right, we taxi out from the gate on time right much like a movie that is not in theaters yet.

267
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:46,185
Scott: However, oh, yeah, we're waiting in line to take off right, you know behind all the other planes.

268
00:14:46,947 --> 00:14:56,887
Scott: and then we're sitting there and we're sitting there and They're like, alright this they said the pilots like alright, there's some weather situation.

269
00:14:56,927 --> 00:14:57,830
Scott: He didn't say what weather.

270
00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:00,981
Scott: He didn't say what any details yet again.

271
00:15:01,062 --> 00:15:03,290
Scott: He just said weather problem, right?

272
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,841
Scott: No planes are taking off to the west.

273
00:15:06,203 --> 00:15:07,309
Scott: So we're waiting behind them.

274
00:15:07,651 --> 00:15:09,862
Scott: I'll update you in 15 minutes and I'm like, uh-oh.

275
00:15:10,545 --> 00:15:11,470
Scott: That's the end, isn't it?

276
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,317
Scott: We're not gonna make it right.

277
00:15:14,337 --> 00:15:15,300
Scott: and then 15 minutes later.

278
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,790
Scott: He's like, I still have no updates from air traffic control.

279
00:15:18,971 --> 00:15:20,015
Scott: Yeah, we're still waiting.

280
00:15:20,195 --> 00:15:21,260
Scott: and then 15 minutes later.

281
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:21,882
Scott: He's like, alright.

282
00:15:21,902 --> 00:15:23,790
Scott: Well, we still don't have any updates.

283
00:15:24,473 --> 00:15:25,779
Scott: It's we've been out here too long.

284
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,944
Scott: We're gonna go back to the gate.

285
00:15:26,964 --> 00:15:28,210
Scott: We're not gonna sit out here that long.

286
00:15:28,411 --> 00:15:29,535
Scott: Right good on them.

287
00:15:29,575 --> 00:15:29,876
Scott: We'll go.

288
00:15:30,157 --> 00:15:30,438
Scott: he's like.

289
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:33,450
Scott: we'll go back to the gate and we'll figure out what to do from the gate.

290
00:15:34,152 --> 00:15:38,230
Scott: The flight crew someone asked them they they were working until midnight.

291
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:45,010
Scott: So as long as something was figured out by like say it was like around seven o'clock at this point, maybe I think right.

292
00:15:46,632 --> 00:15:50,750
Scott: As long as something was figured out by like, you know, the flight there is like two and a half hours.

293
00:15:51,172 --> 00:15:59,329
Scott: It's like by 930 that they could take off at 930 We could land and that wouldn't be breaking the law of the flight crew working past midnight, right?

294
00:16:01,332 --> 00:16:06,728
Scott: And so basically when we just about got back to the gate they were like, yeah, it's canceled.

295
00:16:06,968 --> 00:16:08,894
Scott: I'm like well That's that.

296
00:16:09,275 --> 00:16:10,860
Scott: So I'm basically giving up right.

297
00:16:11,502 --> 00:16:17,788
Scott: and then I'm like, well, there is one remaining option Right and that remaining option is to drive 12 hours.

298
00:16:19,232 --> 00:16:23,930
Scott: We will make it in time if we somewhat immediately drive 12 hours to Chicago.

299
00:16:24,111 --> 00:16:27,518
Rym: We got a full tank of gas half a pack of cigarettes So I could take.

300
00:16:28,001 --> 00:16:29,090
Scott: so I could take Rym's car.

301
00:16:29,331 --> 00:16:33,970
Scott: But the problem with Rym's car is I have no way to get it back from Chicago because that is a one-way trip.

302
00:16:34,131 --> 00:16:36,729
Scott: There is no way that I'm turning around.

303
00:16:36,877 --> 00:16:37,974
Rym: Yeah I would have to.

304
00:16:38,215 --> 00:16:46,990
Scott: but also you would have had to come with me and taking your car home and I would have taken a Plane home or paid to put the car on a truck for someone else to carry it back to New York.

305
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,997
Rym: You didn't want to do two 12-hour road trips.

306
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:51,446
Scott: No not that was not.

307
00:16:51,606 --> 00:16:52,730
Scott: no there was a line.

308
00:16:52,972 --> 00:16:57,376
Scott: right one 12-hour road trip was enough, so I'm thinking all right.

309
00:16:57,497 --> 00:16:59,670
Scott: I'll yell out to all these other people from the flight.

310
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,559
Scott: We're all waiting in the same customer service line.

311
00:17:01,619 --> 00:17:02,423
Scott: Anyway, right?

312
00:17:02,845 --> 00:17:05,338
Scott: I'll yell out be like, all right Who needs to get to Chicago tomorrow?

313
00:17:05,397 --> 00:17:07,609
Scott: I heard one person saying they had a funeral to get to right?

314
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:11,510
Scott: So I'm like, you know, we'll all rent a car together at the airport.

315
00:17:11,851 --> 00:17:19,242
Scott: You know a big one and we can drive like an even if we have 12 people in a 12 person like p-van or whatever We could drive like an hour each.

316
00:17:19,301 --> 00:17:23,297
Scott: It'll be really comfy that Drive before it sucks.

317
00:17:23,317 --> 00:17:25,204
Rym: Yeah with one person it sucks with two.

318
00:17:25,265 --> 00:17:26,310
Rym: It's doable with three or more.

319
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:27,213
Rym: It's actually kind of easy.

320
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:33,448
Scott: It's like if you got a driver's license then, you know, and and you're not the guy who was angry I'll judge I'll judge you.

321
00:17:35,115 --> 00:17:36,659
Scott: There were enough normal people there, right?

322
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:40,090
Scott: It's like, you know, we can make it something about to yell out.

323
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:47,724
Scott: But then I overhear a conversation and the conversation is someone being like, yeah Oh, there's no cars left at JFK.

324
00:17:47,744 --> 00:17:51,133
Scott: I'm like Well That's it.

325
00:17:51,354 --> 00:17:53,123
Scott: That's the end right there the end.

326
00:17:53,264 --> 00:17:54,590
Scott: We're not gonna make it, right?

327
00:17:55,190 --> 00:18:03,136
Scott: So I call and I'm like, you know, I'm like I'm basically destroyed at this point, right and I'm like We're not gonna make it right.

328
00:18:03,237 --> 00:18:06,245
Scott: and they're like, well, I guess we'll FaceTime you or something.

329
00:18:06,265 --> 00:18:08,090
Scott: It's like the end.

330
00:18:08,915 --> 00:18:12,354
Rym: I we did miss my cousin's wedding Not that long ago.

331
00:18:12,715 --> 00:18:17,530
Scott: I mean, you know during the dark times, you know, my uncle missed his own mother's funeral, right?

332
00:18:17,732 --> 00:18:53,408
Scott: FaceTime Tim so but anyway and then You know the phone rings right and I pick up the phone and my mother says, all right, listen apparently My new my new brother-in-law's cousin who I've never met in my whole life Right, is that LaGuardia when I'm at JFK, right and if she supposedly has a car And is a nut job who was ready with this person I never met before was apparently fully prepared to drive the 12 hours alone in a car.

333
00:18:53,428 --> 00:18:54,713
Scott: They had rented I don't know.

334
00:18:54,753 --> 00:18:55,857
Scott: I guess LaGuardia had cars.

335
00:18:55,877 --> 00:18:56,580
Scott: I don't fucking know.

336
00:18:57,041 --> 00:19:00,889
Scott: right and I'm like, well That's crazy.

337
00:19:01,813 --> 00:19:05,605
Scott: But if that's real I got I got to shoot my I got to shoot that shot.

338
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,050
Scott: Yeah, I can't right.

339
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:18,050
Scott: It's like, you know, if you're in the dark place and a the cloud opens the tiniest bit It's like I guess I had to do that even though I really don't want to.

340
00:19:18,714 --> 00:19:20,909
Scott: It's like that is the only path left open to me.

341
00:19:21,171 --> 00:19:24,849
Scott: It's like when you're playing a card game and it's like I guess cuz it's Tuesday, right?

342
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:33,650
Scott: It's like you're playing a card game and it's like well I win if I roll exactly a 17 on a d20 and I draw exactly this card from that deck.

343
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:36,898
Scott: It's like I'm gonna roll the dice and draw the card.

344
00:19:37,018 --> 00:19:38,923
Rym: always bet on an inside straight.

345
00:19:39,504 --> 00:19:46,370
Scott: any any other result bad times Right stuck somewhere between here in Chicago fall asleep and die in a car crash, right?

346
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:50,582
Scott: Lots of bad results, but there is this narrow path to victory.

347
00:19:51,084 --> 00:19:51,364
Scott: There's.

348
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,170
Scott: this is only happening one time.

349
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,041
Scott: This isn't like, you know, I would not.

350
00:19:55,101 --> 00:19:57,557
Scott: hey, it's a unique circumstance Right.

351
00:19:57,718 --> 00:19:58,564
Scott: I only have one life.

352
00:19:58,584 --> 00:19:59,310
Scott: This is it?

353
00:20:00,151 --> 00:20:02,298
Scott: Alright, I'll call a contact this person.

354
00:20:02,339 --> 00:20:05,610
Scott: we get phone numbers are exchanged by the people in Chicago.

355
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,656
Scott: Exchange our numbers, right?

356
00:20:07,676 --> 00:20:10,990
Rym: You've got like a situation room of the family like organizing.

357
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:13,550
Scott: all They really only did was give us each other's numbers, right?

358
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:26,946
Scott: So I talked to this person and sure enough they're in a very long line at Avis rent a car at LaGuardia and they say that they have a confirmation number, right so that they definitely have a car.

359
00:20:27,808 --> 00:20:32,221
Scott: and I'm like All right, we will just get our bag again.

360
00:20:32,281 --> 00:20:35,590
Scott: I'm having a bag that is sent down to the carousel, right?

361
00:20:36,672 --> 00:20:48,282
Scott: And we'll wait at terminal for JFK departures Or arrivals and if you get the car then we'll discuss right and if you don't get the car We'll go home.

362
00:20:50,831 --> 00:20:59,726
Scott: So then they're like, oh there's only 12 people vans left and I'm like, well, listen, I'm not gonna drive a 12 people van, right?

363
00:20:59,766 --> 00:21:01,090
Scott: That's not happening, right?

364
00:21:01,934 --> 00:21:02,882
Scott: I don't think that's gonna work.

365
00:21:02,982 --> 00:21:06,273
Scott: then they're like wait, I Bribe the guy Like.

366
00:21:06,614 --> 00:21:08,240
Scott: this is a person I've never met before.

00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:08,461
Scott: who's?

368
00:21:08,822 --> 00:21:10,950
Scott: my first interaction with them is they're bribing people.

369
00:21:11,011 --> 00:21:11,396
Rym: You know what?

370
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:12,489
Rym: That's a positive sign.

371
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:23,342
Scott: They bribed the guy and got a small SUV and it's like I guess they were trying to give out the vans and were hiding the SUVs, right So bribing works people.

372
00:21:23,383 --> 00:21:24,350
Scott: it was it really happened.

373
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:29,004
Scott: So I'm like, I guess I guess this is happening right.

374
00:21:29,024 --> 00:21:30,609
Scott: the 12-hour overnight drive.

375
00:21:30,955 --> 00:21:34,838
Scott: Okay And that is exactly what happened.

376
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:36,204
Scott: they came to JFK.

377
00:21:36,364 --> 00:21:47,350
Scott: we got caught in the car Right and we drove 12 hours on i-80 Farther west on land basically i-80 the entire way to Chicago a hundred percent of the way, right?

378
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:53,074
Scott: I saw the I. at first I was like, I'd never been to Ohio and I and then halfway to Ohio I was like, wait a minute.

379
00:21:53,094 --> 00:21:54,059
Scott: I have been to Ohio.

380
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:55,405
Scott: I went to Ohio con.

381
00:21:55,445 --> 00:21:56,189
Scott: That was what I've been to.

382
00:21:58,312 --> 00:22:03,656
Scott: And then I was like I've been to Michigan once right we went to You know Pango con.

383
00:22:03,696 --> 00:22:05,484

00:22:11,067 --> 00:22:11,549
Scott: That's right.

386
00:22:12,853 --> 00:22:15,228
Scott: We saw the road to Detroit did not go.

387
00:22:16,531 --> 00:22:19,299
Scott: I saw Gary, Indiana, which is scary as fuck.

388
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:35,349
Rym: the last time I drove to Chicago the purple Pontiac Sunfire Broke down and we we limped north in from Ohio into Michigan because that was the nearest mechanic We could find that was open and we got the car fixed and I wrote a bad check.

389
00:22:35,893 --> 00:22:38,190
Scott: Yeah, I saw lots of sad rest stops.

390
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:42,524
Scott: We passed like a rest stop that had some you know, like compared to nothing.

391
00:22:42,584 --> 00:22:44,290
Scott: the choices were like bad, right?

392
00:22:44,831 --> 00:22:47,325
Scott: But then we're like, alright, we'll go for the next rest stop.

393
00:22:47,767 --> 00:22:48,350
Rym: worst choice.

394
00:22:49,112 --> 00:22:54,510
Rym: I could've warned you the further west you go the worse they get until you hit you like it right next to Chicago.

395
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:57,384
Scott: This is like after the Sun came up around 7 a.m.

396
00:22:57,444 --> 00:22:59,492
Scott: And I'm like, listen, we all right It's breakfast time.

397
00:22:59,572 --> 00:23:01,036
Scott: Whatever the next rest stop is that?

398
00:23:01,056 --> 00:23:03,021
Scott: has anything Brett remotely breakfast related.

399
00:23:03,242 --> 00:23:04,365
Scott: We gotta go right.

400
00:23:04,806 --> 00:23:08,846
Scott: and the next rest stop had Hardee's and only Hardee's.

401
00:23:10,233 --> 00:23:11,220
Rym: That sounds about right.

402
00:23:11,865 --> 00:23:15,876
Scott: I ate a Hardee's Breakfast egg bacon on a vis.

403
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,961
Rym: I am surprised you survived that I.

404
00:23:18,543 --> 00:23:21,390
Scott: that's all but it was the saltiest biscuit in the universe.

405
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:22,115
Scott: I never.

406
00:23:22,135 --> 00:23:24,170
Scott: it was like a pretzel biscuit.

407
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:29,182
Rym: It's like several tears below a bad McDonald's breakfast sandwich.

408
00:23:29,222 --> 00:23:29,924
Scott: What else was I got?

409
00:23:29,944 --> 00:23:31,729
Scott: This is already a desperate time, right?

410
00:23:31,749 --> 00:23:39,290
Scott: So anyway But sure enough at some point like some kind of miracle we arrived in Chicago.

411
00:23:41,393 --> 00:23:46,450
Scott: There were some other situations right like I had purchased before the first flight.

412
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:52,828
Scott: I purchased tickets to the Cubs game and then sold them for a small loss.

413
00:23:53,910 --> 00:24:00,910
Scott: You know, I saw the word, you know the old things I saw in Chicago the the private highway with a toll.

414
00:24:01,293 --> 00:24:02,361
Rym: Oh, yeah, those are a thing.

415
00:24:02,381 --> 00:24:05,456
Scott: Yeah The the terrifying.

416
00:24:05,476 --> 00:24:07,948
Scott: the hell I was by the way was terrifying like 30 lanes.

417
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:13,890
Scott: It was looked like some sort of like it was truly the heart like you think war on cars is bad in New York.

418
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:15,517
Scott: It's like that was the worst time.

419
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:18,130
Scott: It was like some sort of dystopian highway situation.

420
00:24:19,311 --> 00:24:23,243
Scott: But then I saw the outside of where the White Sox play.

421
00:24:23,323 --> 00:24:24,747
Scott: I saw buildings from far away.

422
00:24:24,767 --> 00:24:28,681
Scott: I saw the hotel I saw the wedding venue and I saw the train.

423
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:30,347
Scott: I took the train back to the airport.

424
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:31,150
Scott: train is very nice.

425
00:24:31,652 --> 00:24:33,281
Scott: They got an omni equivalent there.

426
00:24:33,322 --> 00:24:34,770
Scott: I just tapped my phone got on the train.

427
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:35,793
Scott: It's it's very.

428
00:24:35,813 --> 00:24:40,730
Scott: it's a lot like the DC metro where every line comes in and then out of downtown.

429
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:44,580
Scott: Right, so they're all like these u-shapes of each color.

430
00:24:44,721 --> 00:24:49,910
Scott: Yeah, they're basically very easy for commuting and not like the Philly one I can't figure out was very easy to understand subway.

431
00:24:50,392 --> 00:24:55,735
Scott: It took me straight to those they would literally said Oh hair with a picture of an airplane on the side of the train I got on.

432
00:24:56,016 --> 00:24:57,042
Scott: it took me to the train.

433
00:24:57,485 --> 00:25:03,390
Scott: It took me to the airport And then I was like, all right the flight home Who is the last you know?

434
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:07,064
Scott: Basically, we had these two round-trip tickets to United and I was all right.

435
00:25:07,284 --> 00:25:07,586
Scott: and I was.

436
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:09,814
Scott: I was the only one who actually went In the car, right?

437
00:25:10,316 --> 00:25:14,270
Scott: You can't blame someone for not wanting to go on the 12-hour insanity road trip, right?

438
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:22,187
Scott: And so I was only using one return trip out of four total trips and that that flight actually took me home.

439
00:25:22,227 --> 00:25:29,888
Scott: and I was like I actually kind of wanted that to be canceled so I could stay in Chicago for more than yeah 24 hours total like eight of which were spent sleeping, but

440
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:41,550
Rym: I mean I won't flew to Omaha To do a meeting and then flew back and landed at JFK at the same gate the same day And that was a bad feeling.

441
00:25:42,293 --> 00:25:43,129
Scott: That's real bad.

442
00:25:43,853 --> 00:25:47,770
Scott: That was that was I took two sick, but I mean, but were you going to some like, you know?

443
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:50,537
Scott: One-time thing can't possibly miss deal.

444
00:25:50,597 --> 00:25:54,970
Rym: Yeah, it was a very convinced a very rich person to sign a check situation, basically.

445
00:25:55,552 --> 00:25:57,280
Scott: But that's not something that you actually care.

446
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,064
Rym: I didn't want to go I did.

447
00:25:58,124 --> 00:25:59,209
Rym: I could not have it wasn't it?

448
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:00,717
Scott: So I wasn't a check for you.

449
00:26:00,939 --> 00:26:01,341
Scott: No, no.

450
00:26:01,401 --> 00:26:03,934
Rym: No, I could not have cared less Right.

451
00:26:03,955 --> 00:26:06,650
Scott: Yeah, this is like, you know anyway.

452
00:26:08,211 --> 00:26:15,221

455
00:26:30,231 --> 00:26:46,275
Rym: So if you're wondering out there like because a bunch of our friends have also had flight problems like just recently like us Yes flying in America has gotten very much worse relatively recently and there and according to WAPO there are two primary drivers.

456
00:26:46,516 --> 00:26:55,747
Rym: one the airlines just won't pay their employees anything and thus our short staffed by their own fault and To climate change is really fucking up air travel.

457
00:26:56,653 --> 00:26:59,430
Scott: Yeah, this was definitely a climate change weekend.

458
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:04,042
Scott: Oh, by the way that the Chicago looked pretty smoggy like the AQI was 66.

Rym: No, it's not it's not great there.

461
00:27:11,743 --> 00:27:13,130
Rym: Michigan's way better than Chicago.

Scott: Yeah, Chicago was not as good But there was the the I did see.

463
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:24,800
Scott: the best thing I saw in Chicago, which is basically right next to the wedding venue Was this park right on Lake Michigan.

464
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,850
Scott: basically and it's like that was like I was like.

465
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:30,579
Scott: Oh, I was like after seeing the highway, right?

466
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,409
Scott: I was like and thinking Chicago was like a hell place.

467
00:27:34,451 --> 00:27:36,564
Scott: Seeing that park is like everyone was biking.

468
00:27:36,584 --> 00:27:40,099
Scott: There's basically a Exact equivalent of city bike with the different name.

469
00:27:40,139 --> 00:27:41,664
Scott: That's also owned by living entire.

470
00:27:41,724 --> 00:27:45,470
Rym: Everyone is riding it all around Most of all the lakes and they're all like that.

00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:52,250
Scott: It's just there was like all these, you know This whole park right on the the water in Chicago and I gave it was like the most wonderful park and I was like man.

472
00:27:52,491 --> 00:27:55,370
Scott: I wish I could be in this park for more than like, you know a couple hours.

473
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:56,093
Scott: That would be nice.

474
00:27:56,173 --> 00:27:58,423
Rym: lakes like that or why I call everything a pond cuz.

475
00:27:58,864 --> 00:28:00,150
Rym: just growing up in Michigan like that.

476
00:28:00,292 --> 00:28:01,328
Rym: That's what I think of as a lake.

477
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:03,776
Scott: Yeah, it's like they had.

478
00:28:03,836 --> 00:28:06,566
Scott: there was like it wasn't a. there wasn't sand next to it.

479
00:28:06,607 --> 00:28:07,490
Scott: There was like concrete.

480
00:28:07,912 --> 00:28:11,169
Scott: So it was sort of like getting in a pool, but there were like little ladders to go in.

481
00:28:11,411 --> 00:28:12,686
Scott: You know, no one was going in.

482
00:28:12,747 --> 00:28:15,295
Scott: it was You can you got that.

483
00:28:15,355 --> 00:28:17,082
Rym: that's why the cleaner lakes on there was.

484
00:28:17,102 --> 00:28:18,547
Scott: no there was no lifeguard.

485
00:28:18,627 --> 00:28:22,361
Scott: but you you know There were stairs there were ladders going right in the water anywhere.

486
00:28:22,381 --> 00:28:24,650
Rym: I ever swam as a kid had a lifeguard at any point?

487
00:28:25,733 --> 00:28:27,449
Rym: No like that anyway, that's just expected.

488
00:28:29,131 --> 00:28:30,379
Scott: So it was.

489
00:28:30,701 --> 00:28:35,386
Scott: there were parts of Chicago I saw that I would and parts I didn't see that I would like to see.

490
00:28:35,486 --> 00:28:39,090
Scott: so it's like Would I go back there just to see Chicago?

491
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:40,655
Scott: maybe.

492
00:28:42,051 --> 00:28:47,130
Scott: But it's like if there's a reason to go there and like another reason convention, maybe they do have the C2e - right there's.

493
00:28:49,932 --> 00:28:51,536
Scott: Now I know someone right.

495
00:28:57,171 --> 00:29:03,410
Scott: I'll say that they were an awesome person who works in a very interesting business right there in Chicago area.

00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:04,136
Rym: So mom, right?

497
00:29:04,156 --> 00:29:05,448

Scott: not only what like.

508
00:29:29,495 --> 00:29:33,350
Scott: I don't think most people would have been able to like do that drive.

509
00:29:33,492 --> 00:29:33,775
Scott: It's like.

510
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:35,130

00:29:35,271 --> 00:29:35,532
Scott: It's like.

512
00:29:35,895 --> 00:29:40,559
Scott: I don't think any other person besides that person Right or a person like them.

513
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:41,744
Scott: It was gonna work out right?

514
00:29:41,804 --> 00:29:42,990
Scott: I could have done it by myself.

515
00:29:44,013 --> 00:29:44,920
Scott: That wasn't gonna happen.

516
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:55,010
Rym: I mean I have done Several 12-hour drive solo in my life and while they're doable that is pushing the absolute fucking limit.

517
00:29:55,301 --> 00:30:02,249
Scott: Yeah But like this that person was a champion the exact person that I needed in the exact moment that I needed them.

518
00:30:03,074 --> 00:30:07,538
Scott: I'm very thankful to that person and they're in Chicago So if I go there, I'd probably see them.

519
00:30:07,618 --> 00:30:13,970
Scott: Yeah, but the funny thing was that you know at the wedding Everyone's like oh you you were you were the one you drive with that.

520
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:16,850
Scott: You know all the people from the other family that I had never met before.

521
00:30:17,191 --> 00:30:19,379
Scott: We're like, oh you had to drive with that person.

522
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,142
Scott: Oh, we're sorry.

523
00:30:20,162 --> 00:30:21,487
Scott: Yeah, that person's a bit much.

524
00:30:21,507 --> 00:30:22,210
Scott: They're so extra.

525
00:30:22,451 --> 00:30:46,830
Scott: It's like they were like talking down their own family member, right and then late into the evening that person's parents The person's father by the way was is a professional Santa Claus, but like literally Even the person's parents were like apologizing that I had to be in the car with their child Right, and I was like, I think the first you know, it's like I could see what they were talking about.

526
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,378
Scott: The person talked a lot, right?

527
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:49,505
Scott: They had a lot of energy, right?

528
00:30:50,088 --> 00:30:53,137
Scott: You know Right, but it was.

529
00:30:53,619 --> 00:31:00,250
Scott: it was a person who had correct opinions Right who complained in Ohio about it being a place where people don't have right.

530
00:31:00,732 --> 00:31:05,567
Scott: You know, it was a. it was a my kind of my kind of person, right?

531
00:31:05,627 --> 00:31:15,092
Scott: So my opinion of the person was better than their own their entire family's opinion of just You know.

532
00:31:15,996 --> 00:31:17,441
Scott: and that was that was the story.

533
00:31:18,123 --> 00:31:31,290
Scott: so now it's like yeah, I suffered Greatly and was you know had some dark times But now that it once I get more rest actually I'm not done yet the story will be just a good story.

534
00:31:32,072 --> 00:31:39,392
Rym: That will you always look forward to that moment when it just turns into a story you can tell and you're not like fresh from the wounds Exactly.

535
00:31:39,413 --> 00:31:41,221
Scott: It's a. it's a cool scar.

536
00:31:41,261 --> 00:31:47,965
Scott: Let me show you the cool scar when I got stabbed Right that kind of less less bad than being stabbed but you know bad.

537
00:31:48,165 --> 00:31:50,954
Scott: Yeah, so, uh, all right That took up half the show.

538
00:31:50,974 --> 00:31:55,230
Rym: Yeah, we go a little quick on the news, but this one is actually a pretty big deal.

539
00:31:55,692 --> 00:31:56,335
Scott: Why don't we go?

540
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:57,461
Scott: Why don't we just go big?

541
00:31:57,521 --> 00:31:59,250
Scott: because we haven't done a show in a hundred years.

542
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,136
Rym: And also I don't think we're not doing another show this week.

543
00:32:01,156 --> 00:32:02,982
Rym: I'll get back to our schedule next week.

544
00:32:03,423 --> 00:32:21,199
Rym: So, uh in the news there was this application, you know, we used to play counter-strike when you're in college and Getting updates to counter-strike in an era before the modern internet was terrible was it was almost as bad as flight cancelling Despite having two OC threes.

545
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,390
Rym: This was like if a counter-strike point happening.

546
00:32:24,751 --> 00:32:31,610
Rym: You're like talking to people on campus using aim instant messenger or maybe ICQ and you're trying to find anyone who?

547
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:37,570
Rym: Downloaded that exe so you can get a copy of it from them because you can't play counter-strike until you write the up.

548
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:42,027
Scott: We had the best internet there was but the servers that were hosting game files did not.

549
00:32:42,348 --> 00:32:42,469
Scott: yo.

550
00:32:43,751 --> 00:32:45,919
Rym: So this cut there wasn't that company?

551
00:32:45,939 --> 00:32:52,708
Rym: a little company about a workout valve and they released a little app And all this app did was update counter-strike for you.

552
00:32:53,712 --> 00:32:54,154
Scott: That's right.

553
00:32:54,315 --> 00:33:01,990
Scott: And Scott installed this app like I did the media In fact, I installed it at.

554
00:33:03,011 --> 00:33:03,332
Scott: What was it?

555
00:33:03,353 --> 00:33:03,874
Scott: What did we say?

556
00:33:03,894 --> 00:33:07,345
Scott: It was nine twenty eight eight nine twenty six a.m.

557
00:33:08,007 --> 00:33:15,622
Scott: On September 12 2003. now I did not exactly 20 years ago today.

558
00:33:15,985 --> 00:33:23,892
Rym: I installed it 19.8 something years ago because I installed it a little bit after Scott on November 16th 2003 at 1 56 a.m.

559
00:33:23,952 --> 00:33:24,997
Rym: Which says a lot about me.

560
00:33:28,894 --> 00:33:31,164
Scott: Yes, the app is familiar to you.

561
00:33:31,184 --> 00:33:36,221
Scott: It is called steam and I am one of the few people on this planet.

562
00:33:36,843 --> 00:33:37,345
Scott: Just I don't.

563
00:33:37,385 --> 00:33:39,130
Scott: this doesn't really have any value.

564
00:33:40,732 --> 00:33:53,287
Scott: It's just kind of cool that like my years of service badge on my steam profile right now says 20 and like Almost nobody else says 20 like almost nobody right Rym says 19 still.

565
00:33:53,307 --> 00:33:58,730
Rym: Yeah It'll say in a month and four days, right?

566
00:33:58,991 --> 00:34:05,610
Scott: Mine says 20 now and valve put up this cute page that tells you know to celebrate the 20th anniversary of steam.

567
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:06,833
Scott: It shows the hit.

568
00:34:06,914 --> 00:34:12,810
Scott: it tells you the history of steam and the hottest games of each year and you should definitely check out that page.

569
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:13,453
Scott: It's really nice.

570
00:34:13,873 --> 00:34:14,094
Rym: Yep.

571
00:34:14,777 --> 00:34:18,411
Rym: So, you know, it's funny because we just did that panel of packs on games You can't play.

572
00:34:18,452 --> 00:34:21,902
Rym: and one point we made is that video games were invented in living memory.

573
00:34:21,963 --> 00:34:28,250
Rym: Like the first video games were made Before like before people who are alive today were born.

574
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:35,428
Rym: But there are people who are alive today who were already alive and adult before the first video game was ever made.

575
00:34:35,849 --> 00:34:38,217
Rym: So This is still a very early thing.

576
00:34:38,237 --> 00:34:47,290
Rym: Steam's only 20 years old and yet if you were born after us Steam just feels like it's literally always been around because for a lot of gamers steam has literally always been around.

577
00:34:48,231 --> 00:34:52,170
Scott: Yep, people don't know what it was like to not be able to download the game, right?

578
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:57,045
Rym: Yep, so, uh, we'll play some counter-strike when the new one comes out maybe in some other.

579
00:34:57,247 --> 00:34:58,872
Scott: see how much I play But it'll play.

580
00:34:58,893 --> 00:35:00,116
Rym: it will play enough to review it.

581
00:35:00,819 --> 00:35:01,200
Scott: That's right.

582
00:35:01,541 --> 00:35:06,410
Rym: in some actually breaking news the article I'm gonna link to was posted like an hour ago.

583
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:10,902
Rym: Unity the game engine has had a lot of ups and downs.

584
00:35:11,564 --> 00:35:23,230
Rym: There's been a lot of interesting Situations with them lately, but they just changed their monetization model and on one hand There are a lot of people on the internet who are

585
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:24,833
Scott: wrong

586
00:35:24,913 --> 00:35:31,678
Rym: about what changed and mad about things that are not real like they are Freaking out about literally made of bullshit.

587
00:35:32,059 --> 00:35:43,686
Scott: Well, I think first of all, right they wrote this article, you know They made an announcement and have a fact but they didn't unity to did not write all of the information and answer all the questions that people have.

588
00:35:44,087 --> 00:35:52,030
Scott: so some people just Assumed the worst or assumed what you would assume reading that the poorly communicated announcement.

589
00:35:52,211 --> 00:35:54,477
Scott: Yeah, and you know reacted with.

590
00:35:54,537 --> 00:35:56,463
Scott: you know, some some FUD right.

591
00:35:56,884 --> 00:36:05,090
Scott: and then other people, you know Real and semi-real journalists asked and got answers to the the unanswered questions, right?

592
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:14,208
Scott: And so there were some clarifications which resulted in some people being wrong Sort of not their fault, but sort of you know, whatever right?

593
00:36:14,289 --> 00:36:23,986
Rym: Yeah I see people who are still wrong Actively despite well because one particular person wrote an article very quickly.

594
00:36:24,046 --> 00:36:24,468
Scott: That's very.

595
00:36:24,508 --> 00:36:25,250
Scott: it's like a long.

596
00:36:25,595 --> 00:36:26,489
Scott: It's a long article.

597
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:33,210
Scott: It was quickly published like a meet almost immediately after the official announcement and it's like they wrote it in much haste.

598
00:36:33,471 --> 00:36:35,037
Scott: They posted it on many sites.

599
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:37,325
Scott: Not just one like they didn't just have their blog.

600
00:36:37,386 --> 00:36:38,550
Scott: It's posted on like two or three.

601
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,554
Scott: I don't know what's up with that.

602
00:36:39,594 --> 00:36:50,370
Scott: Yeah, and then I saw it being spread around and shared and like Multiple discord servers and other reddit-type places and link sherry places like their article got viral right quickly.

603
00:36:50,530 --> 00:37:01,767
Scott: So and it has misinformation in it because that person did not do any journalism and like I said just assumed Whatever based on the poor communication right that unity put out.

604
00:37:01,868 --> 00:37:02,550
Scott: Yep, right.

605
00:37:02,791 --> 00:37:07,550
Rym: So now anyway, all of that said the actual changes are bad.

606
00:37:08,171 --> 00:37:09,977
Scott: Yo, yeah, they're they are bad.

607
00:37:10,077 --> 00:37:14,690
Scott: that this is that unity is doing bad things but they are not quite as bad.

608
00:37:15,351 --> 00:37:25,157
Scott: They're still way bad, but they're not quite as bad as some people were led to believe due to unity's poor communication and you know Reactionary unresearched blog posts.

609
00:37:25,217 --> 00:37:28,045
Scott: Yeah, but the truth is actually bad.

610
00:37:28,105 --> 00:37:29,108
Scott: So what's actually bad?

611
00:37:29,128 --> 00:37:35,810
Scott: So First of all, let's you know, I still don't have a grasp on it completely all the details.

612
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:47,941
Scott: But basically the way if you use the unity game engine to make your game The way you pay unity and how much you owe them is going to be different than it was before And it's based on how much.

613
00:37:47,961 --> 00:37:51,855
Scott: first item of bullshit Yes First item of bullshit right?

614
00:37:52,637 --> 00:38:05,750
Scott: is that even if you made your game and published it long ago right with unity You're subject to this new model Even if that was not the model when you made your game and you you might not even be making a game anymore.

615
00:38:06,252 --> 00:38:10,088
Scott: Right, you might be out of the gaming business, but you're still collecting like royalties from it.

616
00:38:10,128 --> 00:38:10,630
Scott: doesn't matter.

617
00:38:10,932 --> 00:38:12,181
Scott: You're subject to this new thing.

618
00:38:12,463 --> 00:38:13,510
Scott: That's horseshit, right?

619
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:20,652
Scott: You didn't agree to this you didn't budget and and you know make your game under this assumption of this new model and they change It on you.

620
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,695
Scott: All right, just a milk.

621
00:38:22,177 --> 00:38:25,047
Scott: basically just you know squeeze from your your trickle.

622
00:38:25,088 --> 00:38:26,416
Scott: of whatever games There's a bear.

623
00:38:26,456 --> 00:38:32,726
Rym: There's a Deeper story about unity's motivation, but we'll get to that at the end.

624
00:38:32,907 --> 00:38:33,168
Scott: Oh, yeah.

625
00:38:33,449 --> 00:38:34,533
Scott: Yeah I'm just saying what it is.

626
00:38:34,674 --> 00:38:35,276
Scott: Oh, yeah, right.

627
00:38:36,319 --> 00:38:38,367
Scott: the second item of bullshit, right?

628
00:38:38,427 --> 00:38:38,688
Scott: Is that?

629
00:38:39,189 --> 00:38:39,652
Scott: yeah It's.

630
00:38:39,893 --> 00:38:43,050
Scott: you're still free as long as you're under these thresholds.

631
00:38:43,311 --> 00:38:49,630
Scott: So if your game makes less than two million dollars or you have less than two hundred thousand downloads, you don't have to pay anything.

632
00:38:49,951 --> 00:38:54,065
Rym: Yeah, you have to hit both thresholds to be charged this extra fee.

633
00:38:54,085 --> 00:39:03,850
Scott: And yes So if you don't hit both thresholds Like if you sell 200 if you have 200,000 downloads But you make a dollar or your game is literally free you don't have to pay unity.

634
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:04,733
Scott: Yeah thing right.

635
00:39:05,294 --> 00:39:12,154
Scott: if you make five hundred million dollars because you sold one copy that cost five hundred million dollars You don't owe you to do anything.

636
00:39:12,295 --> 00:39:20,007
Rym: also and that lower threshold the two hundred thousand like that one that only applies to like the home Personal version of unity not the professional.

637
00:39:20,088 --> 00:39:26,030
Scott: Yes Well, obviously if you use the professional or the pay if you pay them for a better version of unity your thresholds go up.

638
00:39:26,171 --> 00:39:27,330
Rym: Yeah, so much closer.

639
00:39:28,672 --> 00:39:30,300
Scott: Real has yes, right.

640
00:39:30,341 --> 00:39:31,064
Scott: So that's sort of like.

641
00:39:31,105 --> 00:39:32,089
Scott: well you did pay them.

642
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:35,910
Scott: You're still not free right, but you now have a bigger threshold.

643
00:39:36,294 --> 00:39:44,470
Scott: So it's like if you pay for the good unity Your game has to be quite successful like a million seller before you start owing them anything additional, right?

644
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:49,089
Scott: So but if you pay them and you get a million seller, okay now you owe them something, right?

645
00:39:49,851 --> 00:39:54,180
Scott: okay, so This was the part one part that was miscommunicated.

646
00:39:54,281 --> 00:39:55,365
Scott: Was that like bundles?

647
00:39:55,425 --> 00:39:55,987
Scott: and charity?

648
00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:56,770
Scott: like doesn't count.

649
00:39:57,091 --> 00:40:04,489
Scott: So if you throw your measly little free game in a bundle and the bundle goes hog wild, you know That doesn't count right?

650
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:06,517
Rym: The other thing that is this part that was lost.

651
00:40:06,818 --> 00:40:18,273
Rym: a lot of people didn't realize or notice and this seems like it was actually In the original release to that the revenue threshold only applies to a rolling 12-month period not like All-time revenue.

652
00:40:19,075 --> 00:40:22,524
Scott: I thought there was an all-time one and no it's all-time downloads.

653
00:40:22,965 --> 00:40:25,070
Rym: It's last months revenue.

654
00:40:25,231 --> 00:40:32,230
Rym: So if you sold a game a long time ago, and it's not making two hundred thousand dollars a year by itself The fees also don't apply.

655
00:40:33,033 --> 00:40:33,675
Scott: Okay, that's good.

656
00:40:33,755 --> 00:40:34,116
Scott: That's good.

657
00:40:34,196 --> 00:40:34,437
Scott: All right.

658
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:35,802
Scott: So but here's the thing.

659
00:40:35,862 --> 00:40:37,086
Scott: Here's the real bullshit.

660
00:40:37,166 --> 00:40:39,915
Scott: is they want to charge Per download?

661
00:40:40,296 --> 00:40:51,833
Scott: right not per purchase per download like yes confirmed I let's say I bought Rym's game and I set up something to delete it and download Delete it.

662
00:40:51,873 --> 00:40:55,788
Scott: I could just download it and download it and download it and download it and download copies and copies.

663
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:57,797
Scott: and they say That they have some model.

664
00:40:57,817 --> 00:41:00,370
Scott: they can detect these frauds or whatever.

665
00:41:01,053 --> 00:41:04,070
Scott: But it's like but they don't want to be transparent about how that model works.

666
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:08,810
Scott: Oh, right, because they don't you know, they say well, we don't want people to understand the fraud detection.

667
00:41:08,971 --> 00:41:12,770
Scott: It's like well look if you want to invoice me for a million downloads.

668
00:41:13,271 --> 00:41:18,447
Scott: You better the fuck be able to have you know, an itemized invoice listing all million downloads.

669
00:41:18,487 --> 00:41:20,520
Scott: I want the IP address I want the time.

670
00:41:20,681 --> 00:41:24,740
Scott: I want everything Listing you to the service the URL the amount of bits.

671
00:41:25,201 --> 00:41:28,010
Scott: list for me every download just like on my credit card statement.

672
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:29,316
Scott: It lists every transaction.

673
00:41:29,757 --> 00:41:31,083
Scott: you bet, you know when we did music.

674
00:41:31,103 --> 00:41:32,750
Scott: I worked in the music royalties business.

675
00:41:33,072 --> 00:41:35,830
Scott: We could list every fucking listen, right?

676
00:41:38,014 --> 00:41:41,301
Rym: We can list literally everything that ever happens to any.

677
00:41:41,502 --> 00:41:46,334
Scott: every micro penny song royalty that comes through was Itemized right.

678
00:41:46,475 --> 00:41:50,490
Scott: I could print out the whole statement for you if I had to and get it from the database somewhere.

679
00:41:50,932 --> 00:41:54,025
Scott: So you can't be sending me some invoice like a million downloads.

680
00:41:54,065 --> 00:41:55,129
Scott: I'd be like fucking prove it.

681
00:41:55,371 --> 00:41:55,735
Scott: Yeah, right.

682
00:41:56,038 --> 00:41:57,170
Scott: Show me the million downloads.

683
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:59,237
Scott: Your model says I had a million downloads.

684
00:41:59,277 --> 00:42:02,849
Scott: show me each and every one what fucking moron made it.

685
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:13,064
Rym: downloads as opposed to Active installs or like browsers can already uniquely identify Devices and web servers can often uniquely identify browsers and devices.

686
00:42:13,245 --> 00:42:17,880
Scott: kind of not really Better than just how about just fucking purchases.

687
00:42:18,322 --> 00:42:28,985
Scott: purchases like we will take you know one cent off anytime someone buys your game or we will take one cent anytime someone buys your game or buys a DLC or buys some skin.

688
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:39,809
Rym: Yep Some broader context is required because there's that at least we have the invoice for so in the article I'm gonna link to that talks about what happened here.

689
00:42:40,411 --> 00:42:46,830
Rym: It has a read more link and the read more link points out another older article and the headline of that older article.

690
00:42:46,891 --> 00:42:53,490
Rym: I'm just gonna read the headline Unity CEO calls mobile devs who don't prioritize monetization quote fucking idiots.

691
00:42:54,451 --> 00:43:06,210
Rym: Yeah, because unity Basically and I'm summarizing Vaguely because you know, you never know if someone's litigious and we're not I want to be guilty of any sort of defamation.

692
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:12,152
Rym: They basically are trying to mostly target the shitware Demographic.

693
00:43:12,593 --> 00:43:13,556
Rym: they their best.

694
00:43:13,636 --> 00:43:21,850
Rym: their ideal customer is someone who makes shitware for mobile phones full of ads and they have their own ad Network and they want you to use their ad bullshit.

695
00:43:22,253 --> 00:43:25,030
Rym: That is their whole model as far as I can say shit.

696
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:29,930
Scott: And if you use their if you use their ad bullshit you are exempt from this new model, right?

697
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:36,674
Scott: Because instead they'll be milking you from the ad bullshit and they don't need the money that you would pay per down Three possible.

698
00:43:36,694 --> 00:43:42,730
Rym: now, this is me as a professional product manager giving my personal opinion on unity without any special knowledge.

699
00:43:43,834 --> 00:43:46,255
Rym: There are three core ways I could see to monetize you.

700
00:43:46,395 --> 00:43:47,781
Rym: well four ways to monetize unity.

701
00:43:47,901 --> 00:43:57,602
Rym: one is you make it a premium thing and you just charge big studios a ton of money and that's obviously not a great option for all the reasons but only makes you so much money because Only so many studios they would all pay for it.

702
00:43:57,703 --> 00:44:00,777
Rym: And then that's it That would pay that much.

703
00:44:00,817 --> 00:44:02,242
Rym: if they'll just pay for unreal instead.

704
00:44:02,262 --> 00:44:04,530
Scott: So well, I mean they could pay for whichever one's better.

705
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:06,970
Scott: You'd have to compete and real and probably better.

706
00:44:07,613 --> 00:44:12,996
Scott: You'd have to get them to choose you right and then they pay for it and it's like, okay And how do you get more customers?

707
00:44:13,036 --> 00:44:16,790
Scott: There's only so many game devs and that are making big money anyway.

708
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:18,646
Rym: So maybe it's not demographics.

709
00:44:18,807 --> 00:44:20,252
Rym: you have Indie.

710
00:44:20,272 --> 00:44:21,978
Rym: get indie developers who make games.

711
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,230
Scott: you have they're only they're gonna only use something that's free zero dollar.

712
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:26,822
Rym: you have larger series that make games.

713
00:44:27,144 --> 00:44:34,010
Rym: you have Lower budget television like you know how the Mandalorian was filmed with the volume and like the game engine type stuff.

714
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:46,605
Rym: Yeah, there are other uses of games and they could go after the beach here like instead of High-end TV and and Hollywood they go after lower end TV and like volume like stuff like.

715
00:44:46,625 --> 00:44:56,569
Rym: that's a demographic they could go after but now they're going after the absolute bottom of the shit where ad revenue barrel the what the the.

716
00:44:57,432 --> 00:45:07,370
Scott: The easy way to say it is that rather than try to get more customers and increase sales of software They're instead going to find ways to milk the existing customers for more money.

717
00:45:07,752 --> 00:45:16,070
Rym: Well, remember that article I was talking about is from 2022 When unity laid a bunch of people off and announced that they were merging with iron source.

718
00:45:16,552 --> 00:45:19,388
Rym: And if you don't know what iron source is there it talks about that when it was news.

719
00:45:19,429 --> 00:45:27,050
Rym: Yeah It's ads are basically the only thing unity cares about and that I don't trust them as a company anymore.

720
00:45:27,453 --> 00:45:28,826
Rym: Not that I've trusted them for some time.

721
00:45:30,291 --> 00:45:35,669
Scott: And so and I guess we can't neglect to mention the fact that they're counting downloads again, right?

722
00:45:36,491 --> 00:45:44,838
Scott: It's like people if you know gamers who evil ones are gonna know this and if they see a game that they know is made With unity and they don't like who made that game.

723
00:45:44,878 --> 00:45:47,750
Scott: They'll just keep downloading it to try to cost that person money.

724
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:55,058
Rym: Yep, especially if it's a game that's at the upper end of the indie sphere often Right you pay.

725
00:45:55,239 --> 00:45:58,050
Scott: it's like if it costs per download, but you only pay for the game once.

726
00:45:58,492 --> 00:46:01,250
Scott: Alright, let's what did they say like 10 cents a download or something?

727
00:46:01,570 --> 00:46:03,359
Rym: Some 4chan dipshit is gonna have a botnet.

728
00:46:03,379 --> 00:46:05,047
Scott: I buy that I could buy the game for 20 bucks.

729
00:46:05,791 --> 00:46:08,223
Scott: I just have to download it like 200 times.

730
00:46:08,364 --> 00:46:14,170
Scott: and now you've lost money Even though you sold a copy of your game because you now Oh unity more than the price of the game.

731
00:46:14,291 --> 00:46:19,061
Scott: Yeah, because it's per download Assuming they don't like detect the fraud or whatever kind of.

732
00:46:19,182 --> 00:46:27,210
Rym: meanwhile in big in big boy business land Let's say I want to have a pricing model that is related to I don't know some some cheering or banding like that.

733
00:46:27,836 --> 00:46:28,221
Rym: I got it.

734
00:46:28,342 --> 00:46:31,697
Rym: I got a announce and document things like.

735
00:46:32,038 --> 00:46:42,466
Rym: we consider one day to be between GMT double-oh double-oh double-oh one and GMT 23 59. here is the math we will use to determine what band you are in like.

736
00:46:42,526 --> 00:46:44,826
Rym: that is how big boy companies announce things like this.

737
00:46:49,518 --> 00:46:52,366
Rym: so anyway things of the day.

738
00:46:54,371 --> 00:47:06,386
Rym: There's Bentley's the car and there's share the vehicle There's a. I guess there's a thing and I understand why I can imagine the kind of person who is into this.

739
00:47:06,787 --> 00:47:07,590
Rym: I am NOT into it.

740
00:47:07,951 --> 00:47:19,870
Rym: I find it capitalist and creepy for a lot of reasons, but it's basically Supermodels doing ASMR tick-tock style videos while they touch very expensive cars.

741
00:47:20,492 --> 00:47:21,214
Rym: Like it's a man.

742
00:47:21,275 --> 00:47:22,720
Scott: That's someone's thing for sure.

743
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:23,843
Scott: It's someone I'm sure.

744
00:47:23,884 --> 00:47:25,589
Scott: there's a lot of people's thing for sure.

745
00:47:26,231 --> 00:47:28,619
Rym: Remember in RIT we learned about pedal pushers.

746
00:47:29,321 --> 00:47:30,063
Scott: Yeah, we did.

747
00:47:30,083 --> 00:47:32,270
Rym: we did so, uh, that's the thing.

748
00:47:33,771 --> 00:47:45,110
Rym: people who maybe Think that that is ridiculous have meme-ified making videos in the exact same format But using things other than Bentley's and Ferrari's.

749
00:47:46,712 --> 00:47:52,110
Rym: So this video is the first one I saw and also the best one and it just cuts back and forth.

750
00:47:52,231 --> 00:47:58,595
Rym: It's very short between the Bentley ASMR and the stare ASMR.

751
00:47:58,877 --> 00:48:03,884
Rym: and if you don't know what the stare is Well, take a look sounds German the best.

752
00:48:03,945 --> 00:48:05,130
Rym: it is definitely German.

753
00:48:05,311 --> 00:48:13,456
Rym: The best part of this video is when the person doing the share video Bob ASMR Starts this device.

754
00:48:13,898 --> 00:48:14,761
Rym: and how long?

755
00:48:14,781 --> 00:48:15,503
Scott: oh, so it's not.

756
00:48:15,563 --> 00:48:16,446
Scott: it's not a staircase.

757
00:48:16,567 --> 00:48:16,888
Scott: Okay, it's.

758
00:48:16,968 --> 00:48:17,510
Rym: it's a tractor.

759
00:48:17,652 --> 00:48:24,928
Rym: It's a big old fucking tractor All right, uh how it starts and the amount of rust on it tell you everything you need to know about why this video is funny.

760
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:32,123
Scott: Okay It's been a long time since we had a webcomic thing of the day But way long ago with the mocha.

761
00:48:32,405 --> 00:48:44,520
Scott: I discovered a person named Daisy McGuire who was doing a comic called gastrophobia about In ancient Greece, that was all cute Great, and I stopped reading it.

762
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,030
Rym: cuz I read everything that was out at the time.

763
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:51,225
Scott: You know that person still exists and is still comicking and they have a relatively new.

764
00:48:51,265 --> 00:48:52,950
Scott: they started it in April.

765
00:48:53,972 --> 00:49:04,009
Scott: They're gonna adapt some Oz shit with their own Twist on it of cuteness and whatnot and they're starting with book two because you've read book one already, right?

766
00:49:05,555 --> 00:49:08,922
Scott: So yeah I've actually never read any Oz book.

767
00:49:08,962 --> 00:49:12,996
Scott: I've just seen the movie and I've never read either.

768
00:49:13,057 --> 00:49:15,710
Scott: I've seen and I've seen wicked the play which doesn't count.

769
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:16,031
Scott: That's not.

770
00:49:16,071 --> 00:49:16,553
Scott: that's written by.

771
00:49:16,633 --> 00:49:25,409
Rym: I have seen two movies and the second one that most people think is the weird one is actually way Closer to the Wizard of Oz type stories than the one that most people know.

772
00:49:25,891 --> 00:49:30,150
Scott: But anyway, this is a a you know, I don't know what the source material is, right?

773
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:32,530
Scott: I vaguely know the source material, but you know what?

774
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,097
Rym: There's a lot going on.

775
00:49:35,117 --> 00:49:43,925
Rym: I that might be a good book club candidate at some point I don't know maybe but this is One of the main characters of that universe is basically Princess Bubblegum.

776
00:49:43,945 --> 00:49:45,330
Rym: Like she was based on this character.

777
00:49:45,792 --> 00:49:49,570
Scott: Yeah, but anyway loose adaptation starting with book two.

778
00:49:51,132 --> 00:49:55,250
Scott: It was very it's very fun and cute at least for someone who has not read.

779
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:58,425
Scott: I mean it begins with like bringing a wooden donkey to life, right?

780
00:49:58,486 --> 00:50:04,622
Rym: So come on You don't even know the name of that donkey cuz that you did.

781
00:50:04,642 --> 00:50:06,470
Rym: you ever watch the second Wizard of Oz movie?

782
00:50:08,955 --> 00:50:11,205
Scott: The donkey in this comic, what did they call it?

783
00:50:11,245 --> 00:50:16,436
Scott: Let me get to the page doesn't matter In the meta moment.

784
00:50:17,018 --> 00:50:19,628
Scott: Oh, no, they bring a pumpkin head guy to life first then a donkey.

785
00:50:19,668 --> 00:50:23,261
Rym: Yep Anyway, the GeekNights book club book the murder about Diaries.

786
00:50:23,462 --> 00:50:25,710
Rym: I have read for murder about Diaries.

787
00:50:26,193 --> 00:50:33,022
Scott: I have read every published murder bot diary including it the two things that were published like on the internet like no one.

788
00:50:33,383 --> 00:50:40,195
Scott: one was in Wired magazine and what which was Sort of like a same universe kind of you know, whatever.

789
00:50:40,636 --> 00:50:45,648
Scott: and then oh, no, the Wired magazine one was like a side story and the.

790
00:50:47,573 --> 00:50:51,478
Scott: There was another one that was in a short story Anthology that I got a PDF of.

791
00:50:51,518 --> 00:50:57,156
Scott: and I've read just that short story from the anthology that was Level of the Prince of Nothing.

792
00:50:57,196 --> 00:50:58,702
Rym: and then there's the atrocity tales.

793
00:50:59,465 --> 00:51:00,710
Scott: Yeah, it's like two of these random.

794
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:04,938
Scott: You don't need to read those but I read them Every published murder bot diary thing.

795
00:51:04,958 --> 00:51:14,343
Scott: and then I saw the first book in a airport bookstore that I didn't on the you know The shelf of first volumes of things.

796
00:51:14,383 --> 00:51:15,470
Rym: so we'll give you all time.

797
00:51:15,671 --> 00:51:22,947
Scott: Read it read a bunch of murder bot Diaries read as many as you can But the bar is all of them because they're that easy to read.

798
00:51:23,047 --> 00:51:27,815
Rym: Yeah So far, you know pretty good though I read the fun.

799
00:51:28,036 --> 00:51:33,199
Rym: I read the third one before I read the second one because my Kindle sorted them weird And it actually didn't.

800
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,830
Scott: I thought I had written read.

801
00:51:35,091 --> 00:51:41,967
Scott: So when I read the newest one the one that was published most recently I thought I had gotten the order wrong, but I did not.

802
00:51:42,067 --> 00:51:49,528
Scott: actually the third large the large one is the second most recent one and then okay final one.

803
00:51:49,688 --> 00:51:56,730
Scott: actually the Chronologically takes place prior to the large one but was published after the large one.

804
00:51:57,111 --> 00:52:15,015
Rym: but it's basically about an aliens kind of universe where a a Robocop situation has occurred and occurs that scale and that's just a thing that society does and one of the Robocops Really doesn't want to do its job and just wants to watch Netflix and then slowly Interacts with things.

805
00:52:15,436 --> 00:52:19,435
Scott: How about since we've read since we raised the bar so high so quickly Why don't we do this?

806
00:52:19,515 --> 00:52:21,062
Scott: the new one comes out in November?

807
00:52:21,082 --> 00:52:25,445
Scott: Yeah, let's do the book club then All right, but the new one will hit in November.

808
00:52:25,466 --> 00:52:28,666
Scott: coming in November At least that's what I think is gonna happen.

809
00:52:28,767 --> 00:52:35,910
Rym: Also The Emily Wilson Iliad, oh god, I feel like we got to pause the book club and do a special book club.

810
00:52:35,990 --> 00:52:36,352
Rym: I'm at.

811
00:52:36,755 --> 00:52:38,082
Scott: it comes out in two weeks.

812
00:52:38,203 --> 00:52:39,329
Rym: I'm real pumped about that.

813
00:52:40,094 --> 00:52:40,276
Scott: All right.

814
00:52:40,356 --> 00:52:42,170
Scott: There was a. there was a piece with her in the New Yorker.

815
00:52:42,431 --> 00:52:43,694
Rym: Yes now I still.

816
00:52:43,754 --> 00:52:49,210
Rym: I still think about that Odyssey translation and how it like really changed how I viewed the Odyssey.

817
00:52:50,031 --> 00:52:51,155
Scott: Yep, so that's that.

818
00:52:51,316 --> 00:52:51,516
Scott: Yep.

819
00:52:51,677 --> 00:53:02,428
Rym: Also we were of course at PAX West 2023 and we did a panel That was actually a brand new panel to an extent that Scott would not disagree that it was an entirely new panel.

820
00:53:02,910 --> 00:53:04,220
Scott: I Cannot disagree.

821
00:53:04,261 --> 00:53:05,290
Scott: That was a new panel.

822
00:53:05,916 --> 00:53:07,210
Rym: I think it was a pretty good pet.

823
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:12,890
Scott: I was still some content of things that we always say because we always say the things we always say, you know What.

824
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:15,219
Rym: I don't think it was a very realistic at any point.

825
00:53:16,262 --> 00:53:19,655
Scott: I don't think we did because it wasn't about that It was not.

826
00:53:19,815 --> 00:53:20,960
Rym: whoa, we've entered a new way.

827
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:26,210
Rym: This is the first time in at least seven years We've done any panel where the word heuristic does not come up at least once.

828
00:53:27,152 --> 00:53:28,360
Scott: Well, you put the word there.

829
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:33,590
Rym: I'm for because it's a really good word But games you can't play is on YouTube.

830
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:40,890
Rym: We have a new pipeline to make high quality videos of our panels pretty quickly now with this equipment that we've got.

831
00:53:41,772 --> 00:53:51,887
Rym: It was also the first packs that we went to where we could do a panel not in masks full production value Kind of like normal and you can just watch it.

832
00:53:51,947 --> 00:53:52,450
Rym: It's on YouTube.

833
00:53:52,571 --> 00:53:56,970
Rym: I uploaded it and we filled the room so a bunch of people got turned away.

834
00:53:57,373 --> 00:53:59,992
Rym: So if you didn't see this panel in person Guess what.

835
00:54:00,353 --> 00:54:03,764
Rym: several people who didn't wanted to see it in person at PAX didn't get to see it in person.

836
00:54:04,206 --> 00:54:06,132
Scott: and we fun side Story.

837
00:54:06,312 --> 00:54:18,628
Scott: we discussed briefly sim refinery in the panel and immediately after the panel one of the people who came up after the panel said Truthfully, they had worked for Maxis on sim refinery.

838
00:54:18,648 --> 00:54:25,139
Rym: man I go off to take my camera apart and someone starts telling me about their vampire tag Which was cool and I come it over to this.

839
00:54:25,159 --> 00:54:27,570
Scott: that person also told me about their vampire tag.

840
00:54:27,851 --> 00:54:31,628
Scott: I'm coming up to stage like I found something they said in some church and I ignored them.

841
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:34,129
Scott: Yeah Sorry, if that person became a geek that's it.

842
00:54:34,992 --> 00:54:37,850
Scott: But then you know, that's the kind of people we are here at GeekNights.

843
00:54:37,970 --> 00:54:45,525
Rym: Yeah, but I come over like I tell Scott I met someone who knew a thing and then Scott's like yeah sim refinery guy Hey, and I'm like fuck you win.

844
00:54:48,251 --> 00:54:56,578
Scott: Last thing the GeekNights' website, you know, you're probably like whatever but guess what that shit is Actually imminent like we are getting.

845
00:54:56,638 --> 00:54:59,970
Scott: we can need like one more patch of some bug fixes and is it done?

846
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:01,655
Scott: No, is it releasable?

847
00:55:01,936 --> 00:55:02,096
Scott: Is it?

848
00:55:02,759 --> 00:55:05,670
Scott: does it do what the cart website does and is it better?

849
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:20,649
Scott: Yes, therefore we should replace the current website with it and then continue to work on it Which will be much easier because it is written with modern up-to-date software So and has a CI pipeline and all this stuff that makes it very easy to work on Once we get it released.

850
00:55:21,172 --> 00:55:49,467
Scott: So it is going to be launched and open-sourced on github and you can actually send you know Poll requests - if you want to help work on it, you won't get credit or money other than the git log message, but You know, you can come help if you want to if there's features you want, you know, whatever and we're gonna sometime soon When we get a chance, we're gonna like sit down You know put it up get it perfect verify that it's correct enough and then move the DNS.

851
00:55:50,108 --> 00:55:50,690
Scott: and that's that.

852
00:55:51,031 --> 00:55:55,170
Scott: It's fine the old page the old websites in the Internet Archive and I also have backups of it.

853
00:55:55,270 --> 00:55:57,470
Scott: So it will not be lost historically.

854
00:55:58,411 --> 00:56:05,557
Scott: But the new website will replace it and all the URLs to my knowledge will continue to work At least the URLs to our website.

855
00:56:05,697 --> 00:56:06,902
Scott: No one's leaving our website.

856
00:56:06,942 --> 00:56:07,704
Scott: Most of those don't work.

857
00:56:07,945 --> 00:56:09,230
Scott: Yeah, we know that.

858
00:56:10,411 --> 00:56:13,159
Rym: That's a blame capitalism for ruining the internet.

859
00:56:13,179 --> 00:56:22,910
Scott: for that one if you could find instant when once it goes up one thing you could Do to help is if there is links that point at front row crew comm slash something that no longer function properly.

860
00:56:23,492 --> 00:56:25,521
Scott: If you let me know that's like the highest urgency.

861
00:56:25,641 --> 00:56:31,746
Rym: as long as one of us lives We will try to make sure every link we've ever posted to our fucking website works.

862
00:56:31,827 --> 00:56:32,931
Scott: Yeah, that's right That's.

863
00:56:32,971 --> 00:56:40,376
Scott: the highest urgency is to make sure the cool URLs don't change right and I don't believe that any of them do So.

864
00:56:40,437 --> 00:56:41,447
Scott: that's gonna happen soon.

865
00:56:41,508 --> 00:56:52,790
Rym: ish You may remember starting around 2008 when we saw and even before then but 2008 when we went to a PAX There was a time when women's god of GeekNights went to a lot of conventions.

866
00:56:52,971 --> 00:56:54,778
Rym: Not a lot of taxes not a lot of gaming cons.

867
00:56:54,798 --> 00:57:00,520
Scott: I'm talking like a lot of conventions We would not just you know, we were going to enemy Boston.

868
00:57:00,941 --> 00:57:01,945
Scott: We would go to Connecticut.

869
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:05,025
Scott: Yeah, right MagFest Which we're gonna go to again probably.

870
00:57:05,085 --> 00:57:06,632
Scott: Yeah We get.

871
00:57:06,672 --> 00:57:09,201
Scott: we also had some tiny conventions here and there.

872
00:57:09,221 --> 00:57:16,887
Scott: right, you know, we went back to RIT for you know The city con sometime I went to like an amazement even went to some Torah cons.

873
00:57:17,388 --> 00:57:17,810
Scott: Oh, that's right.

874
00:57:17,970 --> 00:57:19,257
Scott: That's what was called Torah con.

875
00:57:19,297 --> 00:57:22,010
Scott: Sitacon was the one we went to one time one time and never again.

876
00:57:22,010 --> 00:57:22,291
Rym: I don't think.

877
00:57:22,312 --> 00:57:24,141
Rym: I think it only happened one time.

878
00:57:24,161 --> 00:57:25,307
Scott: I think it also did only happen.

879
00:57:25,328 --> 00:57:35,687
Rym: Yeah we go to a lot of conventions and also we did eat nice four nights a week and We would review and talk about uber cons, yeah every convention we went to.

880
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:37,354
Rym: I have a list of every panel We've ever done.

881
00:57:37,374 --> 00:57:47,239
Rym: There's like 400 panels okay, so we used to review conventions quite a bit and Then PAX has appeared and we started going to.

882
00:57:47,259 --> 00:57:57,166
Rym: PAX is one we stopped going to most other cons and two we would do like a Before PAX show and then a PAX show and then I'll post pack.

883
00:57:57,186 --> 00:57:58,170
Rym: should we do like mold?

884
00:57:59,455 --> 00:58:01,724
Scott: That was because we'd never been to the packs before.

885
00:58:01,764 --> 00:58:03,250
Scott: we never go to Seattle before right?

886
00:58:03,330 --> 00:58:04,116
Scott: We had a lot to say.

887
00:58:04,136 --> 00:58:07,574
Scott: a lot was going on comparing to other cons Done enough.

888
00:58:07,675 --> 00:58:10,650
Scott: It's like you're just gonna repeat yourself from the previous one, right?

889
00:58:10,650 --> 00:58:17,590
Rym: 2018 a decade of going to PAX is what new could we possibly have to say about a convention?

890
00:58:18,592 --> 00:58:19,350
Rym: convention center?

891
00:58:20,291 --> 00:58:24,970
Scott: They don't change that much year to year and even when they do all you have to talk about is the things that changed.

892
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:27,160
Scott: There's no point in reiterating the parts that didn't change.

893
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:29,048
Rym: Yep, but a couple things happen.

894
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:37,299
Rym: So one There was a dark time, you know there's a global pandemic and a lot of people died and a lot of things didn't happen and We weren't going to conventions.

895
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:44,290
Rym: and even when conventions started up again There was still a good year where conventions were happening, but they weren't the same.

896
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:45,273
Rym: They weren't they were.

897
00:58:45,294 --> 00:58:47,521
Scott: inventions have not yet fully recovered.

898
00:58:47,562 --> 00:58:48,465
Scott: Oh, they have not ended.

899
00:58:48,545 --> 00:58:49,549
Scott: the they're not.

900
00:58:49,589 --> 00:58:53,110
Scott: the PAX West to my knowledge did not sell out.

901
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:54,214
Scott: Yeah, there were there were.

902
00:58:54,315 --> 00:59:04,670
Scott: there was a. we went into the you know to get our pick up our badges at the will call And there was a line for buying badges at the door something I had I do not recall seeing.

903
00:59:05,534 --> 00:59:13,690
Scott: I don't recall seeing that at any point between the years 2009 and I saw somebody walk up and I saw someone walk up and buy one.

904
00:59:15,532 --> 00:59:17,141
Scott: So, yeah, but this was the first

905
00:59:19,650 --> 00:59:24,705
Rym: PAX that did not require masks and that was widely like heavily attended

906
00:59:24,745 --> 00:59:25,267
Scott: the dark time

907
00:59:25,327 --> 00:59:29,409
Rym: up since the dark time and simultaneously the second thing that happened

908
00:59:30,550 --> 00:59:30,871
Scott: Seattle

909
00:59:31,433 --> 00:59:38,028
Rym: during the dark time built a new Convention Center because that old Convention Center was not big enough for PAX and hadn't been for a long time.

910
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:47,910
Rym: So this was a the first PAX coming out of the dark time in a brand new Convention Center and a significantly updated format.

911
00:59:49,470 --> 00:59:54,914
Rym: Additionally, it was the first fax in a long time where the keynote was like S-tier.

912
00:59:54,934 --> 00:59:56,563
Rym: I will wait in line for this.

913
00:59:56,704 --> 00:59:57,589
Rym: I am NOT missing this.

914
00:59:58,571 --> 01:00:03,130
Rym: Yeah, exactly, and it felt a lot like old PAX is for a lot of reasons.

915
01:00:03,210 --> 01:00:12,199
Rym: So I think it's time to review what PAX West 2023 was like because it is in many ways very different from the previous Decade of PAX's.

916
01:00:12,763 --> 01:00:12,924
Scott: Yep.

917
01:00:13,368 --> 01:00:18,890
Scott: So The map of PAX that is new Convention Center, which was called they renamed all the different buildings.

918
01:00:19,019 --> 01:00:21,439
Scott: No We got used to be it used right used to be.

919
01:00:21,459 --> 01:00:26,017
Scott: there was the Convention Center and then there was the annex which is built Across the street from the Convention Center.

920
01:00:26,459 --> 01:00:33,084
Rym: around the time that we went to the first pack like that And it was brand new and unfurnished and tabletop was in there.

921
01:00:33,165 --> 01:00:34,711
Rym: in like this in 2008.

922
01:00:34,711 --> 01:00:37,545
Scott: Yeah, it was in like this let us in there, but it was concrete.

923
01:00:37,766 --> 01:00:38,470
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

924
01:00:38,751 --> 01:00:44,809
Scott: So 2009 2010 is when the annex was like done done and that they added the sky bridge to connect the two.

925
01:00:44,869 --> 01:00:54,365
Scott: Yeah So then it's you know PAX was using the convention center the annex and various buildings around the town.

926
01:00:54,385 --> 01:01:02,150
Scott: the Hyatt hotels the Sheraton Hotel the Benaroya Hall the the Paramount Theatre.

927
01:01:02,712 --> 01:01:05,261
Scott: Right all were part of PAX in different years.

928
01:01:05,402 --> 01:01:14,589
Rym: packs would be spread out across these various buildings More and more and more and getting more and more distributed like a lot of nerd cons are that we don't go to.

929
01:01:15,371 --> 01:01:16,937
Scott: Yep, so now they have renamed.

930
01:01:16,957 --> 01:01:18,021
Scott: They have a new building.

931
01:01:18,161 --> 01:01:20,530
Scott: The new building is like a block away.

932
01:01:20,530 --> 01:01:23,383
Scott: It's on the other side of the Paramount Theatre on the other side of the highway.

933
01:01:23,845 --> 01:01:24,950
Scott: It's a big tall building.

934
01:01:25,231 --> 01:01:25,653
Scott: It's like what?

935
01:01:25,693 --> 01:01:27,118
Scott: five five four god.

936
01:01:27,178 --> 01:01:28,121
Rym: Yeah, plus that basement.

937
01:01:28,222 --> 01:01:29,848
Rym: it I mean, I'll just straight up.

938
01:01:29,968 --> 01:01:32,554
Rym: it is I Don't know it's not.

939
01:01:32,594 --> 01:01:37,157
Rym: I can't say that it's the best Convention Center in the world or even in America But I think it's a tall rectangle.

940
01:01:37,277 --> 01:01:39,285
Rym: It is the best Convention Center.

941
01:01:39,305 --> 01:01:41,956
Rym: I Have experience with that.

942
01:01:42,057 --> 01:01:43,101
Rym: I can think of like.

943
01:01:43,563 --> 01:01:45,871
Rym: I got a really good convention centers Like packs.

944
01:01:45,972 --> 01:01:52,550
Rym: Australia is in a fantastic fucking Convention Center, but it's not better than this one, right?

945
01:01:52,630 --> 01:01:53,253
Scott: It's like I think.

946
01:01:53,293 --> 01:01:57,450
Scott: I look I think about the building on its own and I'm like, is this some building that amazes me?

947
01:01:57,730 --> 01:01:58,232
Scott: Wow, it's like.

948
01:01:58,392 --> 01:02:01,001
Scott: no, it's it's a. it's a good place, right?

949
01:02:01,281 --> 01:02:03,970
Scott: But then I'm like, well, let's look at all the other convention centers.

950
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:05,596
Scott: I know is it better than the Javits?

951
01:02:05,616 --> 01:02:05,817
Scott: Yes.

952
01:02:05,897 --> 01:02:06,459
Scott: Everything's better.

953
01:02:07,502 --> 01:02:07,723
Scott: Is it?

954
01:02:08,205 --> 01:02:09,409
Scott: is it better than the Gaylord?

955
01:02:09,469 --> 01:02:09,650
Scott: Fuck?

956
01:02:09,670 --> 01:02:11,300
Scott: Yes, it's better than the Gaylord, right?

957
01:02:11,581 --> 01:02:12,990
Scott: Is it better than the Connecticut one?

958
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:15,650
Scott: The Connecticut one's pretty good, but this is bigger and better.

959
01:02:16,551 --> 01:02:22,430
Rym: Actually, I'd say a top-tier Convention Center limited only by being in Connecticut and being relatively small.

960
01:02:22,470 --> 01:02:25,481
Rym: They think it only have like a thousand person con, right?

961
01:02:26,123 --> 01:02:27,769
Scott: Is it better than the Heinz and the BCEC?

962
01:02:28,271 --> 01:02:29,415
Scott: Yes, and yes, right?

963
01:02:29,435 --> 01:02:29,917
Scott: So it's like.

964
01:02:30,338 --> 01:02:35,276
Scott: it's like I think about it and it's like I can't really you know Say that it's this amazing.

965
01:02:35,336 --> 01:02:35,698
Scott: Perfect.

966
01:02:35,738 --> 01:02:38,527
Scott: Wonderful place, but it's better than the other ones.

967
01:02:38,688 --> 01:02:39,694
Rym: Yeah, right And I think.

968
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:41,530
Scott: but it's also brand new so, you know.

969
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:45,840
Rym: But it's partly it's following modern design like contemporary design not modern.

970
01:02:45,981 --> 01:02:51,750
Rym: Oh, yes convention centers particularly in that I Guess to review it one.

971
01:02:52,011 --> 01:02:56,482
Rym: It has more sunlight than you would ever expect a convention center to have.

972
01:02:56,763 --> 01:02:59,490
Scott: somehow the gem only the basement only the basement was dark.

973
01:03:00,911 --> 01:03:04,743
Rym: Some sunlight access in that entryway because of those pits and the and the light wells.

974
01:03:04,803 --> 01:03:06,167
Rym: Oh, that's that's true.

975
01:03:06,187 --> 01:03:06,649
Rym: That's true.

976
01:03:06,809 --> 01:03:09,615
Rym: And This is even considering.

977
01:03:09,655 --> 01:03:14,030
Rym: the Javits is basically all glass yet somehow even the parts is a job.

978
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:17,910
Rym: It's the Javits is dark in full sunlight through glass somehow.

979
01:03:18,371 --> 01:03:22,785
Rym: I guess it's just your soul leaving your body is what happens there, but it's also.

980
01:03:23,467 --> 01:03:27,358
Rym: there are no Choke points for crowds anywhere like.

981
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:35,110
Rym: I have not seen places other than like professional sporting arenas Designed to such a degree to avoid human choke points.

982
01:03:35,591 --> 01:03:41,090
Scott: It was well, I was reminded this weekend that we have not been to the Chicago Convention Center, which is apparently enormous.

983
01:03:41,351 --> 01:03:46,490
Rym: Yeah, that was I remember heavily suggesting two packs when they were talking about a new packs.

984
01:03:46,611 --> 01:03:51,598
Rym: It should be in the Midwest and Cobo I.

985
01:03:54,013 --> 01:03:55,880
Scott: Anyway, we haven't been to the San Diego one either.

986
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:56,181
Scott: Nope.

987
01:03:56,221 --> 01:04:04,003
Rym: So but anyway, yep, it has Multiple sets of gigantic wide stairs and escalators and none of them broke down.

988
01:04:04,023 --> 01:04:05,406
Scott: It has a brand new.

989
01:04:05,427 --> 01:04:06,630
Scott: they better not fucking break down.

990
01:04:07,152 --> 01:04:13,012
Rym: It has a wide mix of different lots of bathrooms of spaces that all work Like they're just.

991
01:04:13,193 --> 01:04:21,147
Rym: it's a really wide variety of spaces small rooms big rooms high ceiling rooms Dividable rooms undivideable room and it's so big.

992
01:04:21,328 --> 01:04:23,756
Rym: packs Has some room to grow.

993
01:04:23,776 --> 01:04:28,250
Rym: there was a lot of space packs didn't even use and it has the thing.

994
01:04:28,751 --> 01:04:35,110
Rym: But I think the only other convention center I've ever been in that has an equivalent amount of this was the BCC in Baltimore.

995
01:04:35,572 --> 01:04:40,572
Rym: It has a ton of dead space that is not usable for like events Like.

996
01:04:40,592 --> 01:04:50,110
Rym: you can't have panels or events in it But it's there to absorb the crowd Tons of places for people just to hang out sit down do a cosplay photo shoot be out of the way.

997
01:04:50,551 --> 01:04:54,140
Rym: That is something that most conventional centers actually don't have right.

998
01:04:54,260 --> 01:05:01,914
Scott: if none of those areas were as far as cosplay friendly as the gazebo of the Gaylord but There were it was.

999
01:05:01,934 --> 01:05:04,983
Scott: they had much more square footage of those kinds of space.

1000
01:05:05,083 --> 01:05:12,144
Rym: and I if you listen to GeekNights circuit like 2006 we would talk a lot about why the BCC was such a good convention center for Otakon.

1001
01:05:12,425 --> 01:05:14,030
Rym: because it had all that dead.

1002
01:05:14,473 --> 01:05:18,072
Scott: There's a fount that had the fountain area Otter Bean Lobby Yep.

1003
01:05:18,553 --> 01:05:18,934
Scott: All right.

1004
01:05:19,054 --> 01:05:20,719
Scott: So that's the building now.

1005
01:05:20,819 --> 01:05:32,812
Scott: packs itself was mostly in that's new summit building but Half of the expo hall was in the basement of the summit and the other half was in the arch which was the annex Right.

1006
01:05:33,113 --> 01:05:37,008
Scott: the original convention center contained zero packs.

1007
01:05:37,108 --> 01:05:40,350
Scott: that right No packs was in the original convention center.

1008
01:05:40,711 --> 01:05:44,501
Scott: There was however Nintendo live in the original convention center.

1009
01:05:44,802 --> 01:05:46,647
Scott: We did not attend Nintendo live.

1010
01:05:46,667 --> 01:05:47,610
Scott: We didn't get tickets to it.

1011
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:48,402
Scott: We don't go to it.

1012
01:05:49,455 --> 01:05:54,719
Scott: from what I heard is that a There were a lot of lines even if you got tickets to it.

1013
01:05:55,261 --> 01:05:58,330
Scott: be like there wasn't much content there, right?

1014
01:05:58,730 --> 01:06:02,745
Scott: It was sort of like going to an in a big fancy Nintendo booth.

1015
01:06:03,146 --> 01:06:07,029
Scott: There's some merch sales You know, there was some eSports tournaments going on there.

1016
01:06:07,491 --> 01:06:15,760
Scott: But I think a lot a lot of people were generally not too excited about it, you know They would go to it see it and be like, alright, that's enough.

1017
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:18,030
Scott: Even the kind of people who like that sort of thing.

1018
01:06:18,217 --> 01:06:20,879
Scott: Yeah But that's just the gist.

1019
01:06:20,939 --> 01:06:22,690
Scott: I got that second third hand knowledge.

1020
01:06:22,851 --> 01:06:26,262
Scott: I suggest if you care about how was Nintendo live good?

1021
01:06:26,282 --> 01:06:27,927
Scott: because maybe you're thinking about.

1022
01:06:28,007 --> 01:06:33,050
Scott: should you go To another Nintendo live event in the future, you know put forth the effort for that.

1023
01:06:33,532 --> 01:06:36,947
Scott: You'll want to get the opinion of someone who was actually in there which was not us.

1024
01:06:37,048 --> 01:06:41,410
Rym: Yep Nor is it for us, but no had we got over there?

1025
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:42,032
Rym: I was there.

1026
01:06:42,133 --> 01:06:43,780
Scott: are people right there are?

1027
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:49,784
Scott: I am seeing online a lot of chatter Among the kind of person who cares a lot about the expo hall there were.

1028
01:06:49,985 --> 01:06:54,170
Scott: some people were upset That it was split between the two places.

1029
01:06:54,311 --> 01:06:57,545
Rym: I think we write the same reddit post where half the comments of people like dude.

1030
01:06:57,606 --> 01:06:58,530
Rym: It's like right there.

1031
01:06:58,731 --> 01:06:59,233
Rym: How is this?

1032
01:06:59,394 --> 01:07:00,319
Scott: it was just right there?

1033
01:07:00,359 --> 01:07:05,241
Scott: Yeah, but all I've also seen though Exhibitors, this is a real concern right?

1034
01:07:05,683 --> 01:07:11,544
Scott: some exhibitors are like, you know They see the how many people are coming through and they're thinking shit.

1035
01:07:11,644 --> 01:07:13,510
Scott: Am I in the wrong one, right?

1036
01:07:13,610 --> 01:07:15,277
Scott: Should I have gotten a booth on the other half?

1037
01:07:15,538 --> 01:07:17,687
Scott: right now is everyone in the other half and it's like.

1038
01:07:17,707 --> 01:07:24,350
Scott: you might think The basement one was the hot one or you might but no but wait the annex one had the big companies in it, right?

1039
01:07:24,450 --> 01:07:31,164
Scott: Maybe that's the hot one and it's like if you're working all day in one Right and then it closes they both close at the same time.

1040
01:07:31,185 --> 01:07:33,677
Scott: You don't really see the other one You don't know.

1041
01:07:33,718 --> 01:07:34,482
Scott: you might think shit.

1042
01:07:34,523 --> 01:07:35,730
Scott: is my booth in the wrong, right?

1043
01:07:35,790 --> 01:07:39,442
Scott: It's like, you know and like we said the attendance was down overall.

1044
01:07:39,502 --> 01:07:39,923
Scott: So it's like.

1045
01:07:40,405 --> 01:07:42,050
Scott: that's why you weren't seeing people, right?

1046
01:07:42,090 --> 01:07:43,474
Scott: I think people were going to both.

1047
01:07:43,574 --> 01:08:00,341
Scott: Yeah, some people were upset about it being completely split up into two things like that Because if you think about it in every previous packs even the ones that were super spread out the expo hall was always one contiguous space and So expo hall people would go to one place and that was it.

1048
01:08:00,642 --> 01:08:02,249
Scott: They haven't had to move around now.

1049
01:08:02,289 --> 01:08:09,490
Rym: great Is that one space was sprawling like you'd go over into the X. there were like shit where the Chessex booth used to be.

1050
01:08:10,371 --> 01:08:13,102
Scott: Chessex booth was not there at all period as upsetting.

1051
01:08:13,725 --> 01:08:14,930
Scott: Anyway, not that I need to dice.

1052
01:08:16,111 --> 01:08:18,282
Rym: Always walk by the dice and look at him and think dice.

1053
01:08:18,984 --> 01:08:19,788
Scott: That's what I do.

1054
01:08:20,754 --> 01:08:21,982
Scott: So anyway, they'll be it unplugged.

1055
01:08:22,042 --> 01:08:22,344
Scott: I bet.

1056
01:08:22,385 --> 01:08:22,988
Scott: Yeah, come on.

1057
01:08:23,270 --> 01:08:31,029
Scott: But the fact that packs was effectively all in one all the things that weren't the expo hall were entirely in the new building.

1058
01:08:31,130 --> 01:08:35,225
Scott: Oh, except for the PC freeplay byo PC VR.

1059
01:08:35,305 --> 01:08:37,573
Scott: that was in the annex also Oh and the merch booth.

1060
01:08:37,694 --> 01:08:41,090
Scott: the merch booth is in the annex, which sorry arch it changes name to art.

1061
01:08:41,109 --> 01:08:44,510
Rym: It was particularly fine because byo PC is almost like this.

1062
01:08:45,053 --> 01:08:48,189
Rym: It's like a there's a velvet rope and it's its own thing.

1063
01:08:48,430 --> 01:08:54,680
Rym: So it's actually that's one of the best possible things to put in the out-of-the-way space Because you can't go into it if you're not doing it.

1064
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:56,470
Rym: and if you're doing it you're hanging out there.

1065
01:08:56,550 --> 01:08:57,996
Rym: It's like I'm just like your luxury box.

1066
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:10,140
Rym: So I guess packs Did suffer in my opinion as it had expanded into a bunch of venues because it reduced the cross Pollination like in the in the PAX West.

1067
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:23,760
Rym: up until the dark times There was definitely this vibe that like when the years when tabletop was in the hotel by itself Tabletop people really only went there and didn't go anywhere else and all the people who were anywhere else Never came to tabletop.

1068
01:09:23,801 --> 01:09:28,845
Rym: like it was almost like two different conventions The fact that everything was in the same room or in the same building.

1069
01:09:28,885 --> 01:09:36,499
Rym: This is one of the first packs I've been to in a long time where when I wandered around the con I saw a lot of areas.

1070
01:09:36,679 --> 01:09:40,250
Rym: all had a pretty good number of people hanging around in them and walking through.

1071
01:09:40,631 --> 01:09:41,956
Rym: There was a lot of discovery.

1072
01:09:42,417 --> 01:09:45,028
Rym: I found some things I didn't notice on the schedule just walking around.

1073
01:09:45,429 --> 01:09:52,870
Rym: that Cross-pollination was the magic of when packs was smaller and fit entirely within the old convention center and they brought it back.

1074
01:09:53,781 --> 01:09:55,630
Scott: Yep All right.

1075
01:09:55,750 --> 01:09:57,777
Scott: So other things that were going down at packs.

1076
01:09:57,997 --> 01:10:02,150
Scott: it had all the usual things that a packs has right steel battalion guy.

1077
01:10:02,391 --> 01:10:05,642
Scott: He was there right, but they added some new stuff, right?

1078
01:10:05,923 --> 01:10:06,645
Scott: They added the.

1079
01:10:06,987 --> 01:10:07,930
Scott: there's this guy.

1080
01:10:08,130 --> 01:10:08,853
Scott: He was thing of the day.

1081
01:10:08,973 --> 01:10:36,400
Scott: once this guy he's collecting artifacts of Super Nintendo most the artwork and you know physical artifacts that were used in or photographed or included in Super Nintendo Super Nintendo Power magazine right and that guy who I had seen on the internet and made a thing of the day brought his collection to packs and had a whole room where he set it all up so everyone could enjoy it and he could share it because that's That guy is the eye.

1082
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:40,196
Scott: if you want to be a collector That's the guy you want to be right.

1083
01:10:40,457 --> 01:10:44,970
Scott: be like that guy where you collect for the sake of sharing and having everyone.

1084
01:10:45,211 --> 01:10:46,054
Rym: He's not a collector.

1085
01:10:46,094 --> 01:10:46,856
Rym: He's a curator.

1086
01:10:47,438 --> 01:10:47,900
Scott: That's right.

1087
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:49,847
Scott: He made his own basically like actual.

1088
01:10:49,887 --> 01:10:50,750
Scott: he's doing it the way I'm using.

1089
01:10:50,770 --> 01:10:51,354
Scott: He's one guy.

1090
01:10:51,435 --> 01:11:00,233
Scott: All right, so That was awesome to actually see that stuff in person and out the guy who I'd seen on the internet and he had a whole Room to himself.

1091
01:11:00,716 --> 01:11:01,981
Scott: people were lining up to see it.

1092
01:11:02,021 --> 01:11:02,303
Scott: Good thing.

1093
01:11:02,323 --> 01:11:08,041
Scott: We saw it right away didn't have to wait in a line Because it was less crowded on Friday when we saw it.

1094
01:11:08,422 --> 01:11:10,010
Scott: packs was more crowded the other days.

1095
01:11:12,131 --> 01:11:12,934
Scott: What else was going?

1096
01:11:13,035 --> 01:11:15,726
Scott: oh the Alexandria tabletop RPG library was there.

1097
01:11:15,766 --> 01:11:19,650
Scott: they had been there before But they had the best setup they've had yet, right?

1098
01:11:19,730 --> 01:11:20,790
Scott: They had like a whole room going on.

1099
01:11:20,850 --> 01:11:28,130
Rym: I was a big room and that's sort of a theme all the spaces that used to be crammed into like half Or a quarter of a panel room in the old boxes.

1100
01:11:28,692 --> 01:11:33,149
Rym: They basically had big rooms with exterior windows and sunlight and plenty of space to do their thing.

1101
01:11:33,752 --> 01:11:38,350
Scott: Yep, there was a room with like an actual arcade in it, but I think they could have put that in a bigger room.

1102
01:11:38,571 --> 01:11:43,049
Rym: I think that was but it was the best arcade that's ever been at a PAX.

1103
01:11:44,471 --> 01:11:47,100
Scott: Any pack of the of the PAX is that I have been to.

1104
01:11:47,742 --> 01:11:49,910
Scott: that is the best arcade out of packs obvious.

1105
01:11:50,030 --> 01:11:51,817
Scott: It was like someone cut out like.

1106
01:11:51,877 --> 01:11:57,730
Scott: I took like one machine from every section of the magfest arcade Yeah, and put them into like one tiny room.

1107
01:11:57,770 --> 01:12:04,757
Rym: I said you your machines because there were two at a pack that never thought I'd see a DDR machine at a PAX Yeah, and there were two there.

1108
01:12:05,319 --> 01:12:07,909
Scott: It's like they had a little row of you know, the Japanese sit-down ones.

1109
01:12:08,310 --> 01:12:13,892
Scott: Yeah, it was like there's like a pinball one pinball some rhythm guys, you know It was.

1110
01:12:14,093 --> 01:12:14,695
Scott: it was decent.

1111
01:12:14,875 --> 01:12:19,410
Scott: There was some fun times in there, but it was also small cramped dark smelly.

1112
01:12:19,631 --> 01:12:21,681
Scott: Yeah, it's an arcade warm really warm in there.

1113
01:12:21,762 --> 01:12:26,399
Rym: I think it and Tabletop freeplay needed more space.

1114
01:12:26,982 --> 01:12:31,341
Scott: I did not spend much time in there But I looked at the selection and I said that is quality.

1115
01:12:31,482 --> 01:12:33,590
Rym: Yeah, I even spent some time in classic console.

1116
01:12:33,771 --> 01:12:37,254
Rym: I got about halfway through Castlevania 1 while I was waiting for Like.

1117
01:12:37,274 --> 01:12:38,981
Scott: I played some non duck hunt like gun.

1118
01:12:39,101 --> 01:12:39,985
Rym: Oh, yeah the balloon game.

1119
01:12:40,688 --> 01:12:44,370
Rym: Yeah Tabletop had a fantastic space.

1120
01:12:44,450 --> 01:12:45,474
Rym: It just wasn't big enough.

1121
01:12:45,855 --> 01:12:49,910
Rym: like you could find tables on all the days, but Saturday.

1122
01:12:50,091 --> 01:12:52,229
Rym: But it was actually completely full on Saturday.

1123
01:12:53,132 --> 01:13:01,630
Scott: Yep, the way they set it up was they put all the freeplay tables in the middle and they surrounded it with vendors all around The edge which was all right kind of clever.

1124
01:13:01,770 --> 01:13:07,270
Rym: But you know subject to change the packs arena had not been there and it had encompassed that entire space.

1125
01:13:07,632 --> 01:13:10,185
Rym: I think it would have been about big enough based on that crowd.

1126
01:13:10,909 --> 01:13:12,503
Scott: Oh, yeah That would have been more than big enough.

1127
01:13:12,564 --> 01:13:24,366
Rym: I think right I don't know if that would be big enough for a fully realized sold-out packs, but it would definitely been enough for that packs sure Yeah, and you know tabletop was its usual self right.

1128
01:13:24,446 --> 01:13:27,637
Scott: free plays You know first looks turn of.

1129
01:13:27,717 --> 01:13:30,045
Scott: everything was going down as usual, right?

1130
01:13:30,065 --> 01:13:31,470
Rym: We even entered a tournament.

1131
01:13:32,771 --> 01:13:34,098
Scott: Let's tell the story of the tournament.

1132
01:13:34,179 --> 01:13:34,802
Rym: Oh god.

1133
01:13:35,365 --> 01:13:36,230
Scott: Yeah, it was just quickly.

1134
01:13:36,311 --> 01:13:39,370
Scott: So cat in the box is a little trick-taking game cute little trick-taking game.

1135
01:13:39,410 --> 01:13:41,481
Scott: We've did an episode on it that you can listen to.

1136
01:13:41,722 --> 01:13:43,029
Rym: we both think really good at it.

1137
01:13:43,872 --> 01:13:45,589
Scott: There's a cat and I think I'm pretty good at it.

1138
01:13:45,670 --> 01:13:47,060
Scott: Then there was a cat in the box tournament.

1139
01:13:47,241 --> 01:13:48,450
Scott: on the schedule, right?

1140
01:13:48,911 --> 01:13:50,950
Scott: And I'm like, hey, we should enter that cat in the box tournament.

1141
01:13:51,291 --> 01:13:55,590
Scott: And as long as it's it's only a 16 person tournament four games of four people each.

1142
01:13:56,212 --> 01:13:58,743
Scott: Each of all the four winners play each other in one gate.

1143
01:13:58,763 --> 01:14:00,370
Scott: You only have to play two games of cat in the box.

1144
01:14:00,430 --> 01:14:02,076
Scott: Yeah, that's not a big time investment.

1145
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:05,349
Scott: And if you lose the first game, you only have to play one game of cat in the box.

1146
01:14:07,052 --> 01:14:08,660
Scott: It's like such a small time investment.

1147
01:14:08,761 --> 01:14:09,525
Scott: we love this game.

1148
01:14:09,585 --> 01:14:10,389
Scott: Let's just go do it.

1149
01:14:10,751 --> 01:14:11,617
Scott: We went early.

1150
01:14:11,798 --> 01:14:14,973
Scott: we got tickets to be in the tournament, you know Cuz only 16 people can enter.

1151
01:14:15,274 --> 01:14:16,798
Scott: we came back after our panel.

1152
01:14:17,319 --> 01:14:18,182
Scott: We entered the tournament.

1153
01:14:19,084 --> 01:14:33,170
Rym: I was surprised that of the 16 people Most of the people had not played cat like I think me Scott and like two other people literally Had ever played the game before and everyone else didn't need like had knew nothing about it and expected to be taught.

1154
01:14:33,872 --> 01:14:34,515
Scott: Right, it's like all right.

1155
01:14:34,555 --> 01:14:36,763
Scott: who enters a tournament not knowing how to play the game?

1156
01:14:36,783 --> 01:14:38,770
Rym: apparently almost everyone, right?

1157
01:14:38,890 --> 01:14:41,343
Scott: But at the second on the other hand, it's like that's totally fine.

1158
01:14:41,604 --> 01:14:42,670
Scott: It's like I'm cool with that.

1159
01:14:43,251 --> 01:14:49,870
Rym: Yeah, you know a funny situation because they actually didn't really have enough enforcers to teach like at scale me and Scott.

1160
01:14:50,731 --> 01:14:52,098
Scott: Everyone had to play like that.

1161
01:14:52,158 --> 01:14:54,269
Rym: We both taught everyone between the two of us.

1162
01:14:55,052 --> 01:14:57,521
Scott: Yeah, so in the first game I played right.

1163
01:14:57,661 --> 01:15:01,649
Scott: it was two people who didn't know how to play at a person who did know Same as my first game.

1164
01:15:02,551 --> 01:15:05,239
Scott: And so I played and I was a. there was one.

1165
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:08,670
Scott: the one person who didn't know how to play was asking lots of questions.

1166
01:15:08,891 --> 01:15:14,330
Scott: Right, the person who didn't know how to play was pro and the other person didn't know how to play.

1167
01:15:14,691 --> 01:15:17,100
Scott: They understood the rules explanation perfectly.

1168
01:15:17,140 --> 01:15:18,807
Scott: They played perfectly correctly.

1169
01:15:19,108 --> 01:15:19,630
Scott: They did not play.

1170
01:15:19,710 --> 01:15:27,398
Scott: Well, no person who was asking all kinds of questions all the time and act and like you thought they didn't know what the hell They were doing and they were playing poorly.

1171
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:28,725
Scott: They played extremely.

1172
01:15:28,765 --> 01:15:29,770
Scott: Well, they were dominating.

1173
01:15:30,491 --> 01:15:34,063
Scott: The person who was pro was playing as well as they could.

1174
01:15:34,103 --> 01:15:36,090
Scott: they had this the worst luck after game one.

1175
01:15:36,271 --> 01:15:38,521
Scott: They're just like after the second and third hands.

1176
01:15:38,581 --> 01:15:41,192
Scott: They were just they had such bad luck They would have won.

1177
01:15:41,212 --> 01:15:43,683
Scott: Yeah, because they played like the best I've seen like.

1178
01:15:43,723 --> 01:15:45,430
Scott: they probably played better than I did honestly.

1179
01:15:46,411 --> 01:15:53,090
Scott: And then me I played average with my conservative play and I got lucky in game four and I won by one point.

1180
01:15:53,230 --> 01:15:54,454
Scott: Yeah, so how did?

1181
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:55,879
Scott: how did your first game so mine?

1182
01:15:55,939 --> 01:15:56,381
Rym: Similarly?

1183
01:15:56,421 --> 01:15:57,966
Rym: I had two people who had never played before.

1184
01:15:58,327 --> 01:15:58,969
Rym: one person who?

1185
01:16:00,410 --> 01:16:08,087
Rym: Expressed constant annoyance that nobody knew how to play in the tournament and like I expected to play with pros or police people who know What they're doing and he was kind of mad about it.

1186
01:16:08,691 --> 01:16:13,489
Rym: And then me the guy who knew how to play and seems to really want to win.

1187
01:16:15,710 --> 01:16:18,509
Rym: He failed and caused the paradox two out of the four rounds.

1188
01:16:20,012 --> 01:16:22,827
Scott: Like he just I made one paradox, but it was a zero.

1189
01:16:22,867 --> 01:16:23,350
Scott: so I was fine.

1190
01:16:23,350 --> 01:16:25,578
Rym: Yep He crashed and burned into dust like it was.

1191
01:16:25,678 --> 01:16:26,923
Rym: it was awful to watch.

1192
01:16:27,485 --> 01:16:31,641
Rym: of the two people who had not played One of them the person who won and I lie.

1193
01:16:31,701 --> 01:16:33,026
Rym: He beat me by one point.

1194
01:16:33,046 --> 01:16:34,953
Rym: I Learned afterward.

1195
01:16:35,174 --> 01:16:39,490
Rym: He had never played cat in the box, but this was a trick-taking game person.

1196
01:16:40,450 --> 01:16:42,422
Rym: So I feel okay about that.

1197
01:16:42,482 --> 01:16:43,770
Rym: But also I think it's noteworthy.

1198
01:16:43,991 --> 01:16:52,563
Rym: I think we found broadly where the limits of skill are in cat in the box in that the scores were also closed despite This wide range of player skills.

1199
01:16:52,583 --> 01:16:53,950
Rym: There is a lot of luck in cat in the box.

1200
01:16:53,970 --> 01:16:55,118
Rym: You got to play a lot as a lot.

1201
01:16:55,158 --> 01:16:58,154
Rym: Yeah to tease out pure skill The box.

1202
01:16:58,435 --> 01:17:03,650
Scott: yeah this weekend that weekend I really unlocked and I feel like I have I won't say I've solved cat in the box.

1203
01:17:03,851 --> 01:17:05,403
Rym: Oh coming into the final game.

1204
01:17:05,584 --> 01:17:06,330
Scott: I've got it locked.

1205
01:17:06,450 --> 01:17:08,977
Rym: I've got it locked down coming into the final hand in my round.

1206
01:17:09,218 --> 01:17:15,979
Rym: I came into it up by like six points and I paradoxed Solely because of the hand I had like.

1207
01:17:15,999 --> 01:17:17,327
Rym: there was no way out of that.

1208
01:17:18,379 --> 01:17:19,050
Scott: But that happens.

1209
01:17:19,911 --> 01:17:28,263
Scott: So I'm in the finals and we want we purposely played in separate games in the first round and hopes To take half of the seats in the final just like what happened with sir.

1210
01:17:28,283 --> 01:17:30,170
Scott: Oh, that's right, but that did not happen.

1211
01:17:30,231 --> 01:17:36,310
Scott: I went to the finals alone All right, and I this were me the person that beat Rym another person.

1212
01:17:36,471 --> 01:17:38,181
Scott: We're all sitting there chatting having a good time.

1213
01:17:38,222 --> 01:17:39,530
Scott: They seemed like nice people, right?

1214
01:17:39,770 --> 01:17:41,359
Scott: We're waiting for the fourth game to end.

1215
01:17:41,399 --> 01:17:44,937
Scott: apparently in the fourth game There was five players.

1216
01:17:45,058 --> 01:17:48,090
Scott: I think as they'd let an extra person in so that game was weird, right?

1217
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:56,505
Scott: And they were also taking a long time Which had me nervous that maybe one of the players over there was a slowpoke and I didn't really want to play with some slowpoke, right.

1218
01:17:57,632 --> 01:17:59,429
Scott: Hopefully a fast person from over there won.

1219
01:18:00,411 --> 01:18:05,350
Scott: So anyway, a person comes over finally from the fifth from the fourth and final game to play in the finals with us.

1220
01:18:05,857 --> 01:18:06,528
Scott: They seemed chill.

1221
01:18:06,891 --> 01:18:12,690
Scott: They were actually the partner of the pro cool person who should have won but was very unlucky in my first game.

1222
01:18:13,213 --> 01:18:14,741
Scott: So I saw I was like, oh, this is great.

1223
01:18:14,801 --> 01:18:17,524
Scott: It was not some shitty person that Came over.

1224
01:18:18,725 --> 01:18:23,619
Scott: Well So we start playing right and everything's going great.

1225
01:18:23,639 --> 01:18:25,272
Scott: and we're not.

1226
01:18:25,292 --> 01:18:30,253
Scott: we're in the first hand like the third trick, right and The.

1227
01:18:30,293 --> 01:18:40,150
Scott: the person to my left who may I think was the person that beat Rym Points out that the person who was the the partner of the pro person right the last person to come over.

1228
01:18:40,330 --> 01:18:45,850
Scott: He's like, hey, you only have four cars in your hand and everyone else has six and I'm like, oh who cares?

1229
01:18:45,951 --> 01:18:47,199
Scott: It's I'm like, let's just start over.

1230
01:18:47,259 --> 01:18:48,970
Scott: We just started two seconds ago, right?

1231
01:18:49,090 --> 01:18:52,835
Scott: But we want to make sure the game is correct, right, you know Like.

1232
01:18:52,855 --> 01:18:55,910
Rym: there's no way to recover from that kind of error in a card game, right?

1233
01:18:55,970 --> 01:19:00,710
Scott: It's like all these cards are face down and hidden information like cards that we discarded at the start of the game.

1234
01:19:00,770 --> 01:19:04,610
Scott: It's like we can't be looking at them trying to figure out which card went where right?

1235
01:19:04,750 --> 01:19:08,264
Scott: It's like we can't be letting someone look at any card that's face down on the table.

1236
01:19:08,284 --> 01:19:08,947
Scott: Right?

1237
01:19:09,188 --> 01:19:14,527
Scott: So it's like That you know, we can't like correct this without some asterisk bullshit.

1238
01:19:14,547 --> 01:19:15,330
Scott: Let's just restart.

1239
01:19:15,390 --> 01:19:16,415
Scott: We'll all have a fair game.

1240
01:19:16,757 --> 01:19:19,529
Scott: It's just a cat in the box tournament at who gives a shit.

1241
01:19:20,091 --> 01:19:21,757
Scott: It's like let's just restart right?

1242
01:19:21,977 --> 01:19:26,877
Scott: and the guy the partner of the pro person was like no No, no, I could fix this.

1243
01:19:26,918 --> 01:19:27,522
Scott: we could fix this.

1244
01:19:27,543 --> 01:19:28,510
Scott: Let's figure it out, right?

1245
01:19:28,590 --> 01:19:31,804
Scott: We can figure this out and I'm like, why do we need to figure?

1246
01:19:31,885 --> 01:19:33,110
Scott: it's like we just started.

1247
01:19:33,171 --> 01:19:33,433
Scott: What do you?

1248
01:19:33,474 --> 01:19:35,110
Scott: why do you want to figure it out so bad, right?

1249
01:19:35,310 --> 01:19:36,756
Scott: It's like we can't.

1250
01:19:36,776 --> 01:19:38,764
Scott: I'm like just just chill out and we'll restart.

1251
01:19:39,286 --> 01:19:40,693
Scott: and he's like no no no No, we could.

1252
01:19:40,733 --> 01:19:41,700
Scott: we can definitely fix this.

1253
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:45,590
Scott: he starts trying to fix it and I'm like Why don't we just vote on it then if there's a disagreement, right?

1254
01:19:45,750 --> 01:19:47,876
Scott: Let's let's have these other two people decide.

1255
01:19:47,916 --> 01:19:58,710
Scott: we've already basically decided and he's like you're only voting to restart cuz I'm winning And I'm like, it's this is three tricks in to a four hand game.

1256
01:19:59,252 --> 01:19:59,895
Scott: And I'm just like.

1257
01:20:00,076 --> 01:20:13,841
Rym: I just stood up and I said I forfeit by which I think was the right call because that not only does this prove that you in fact were not advocating for this because you thought this guy was winning but it also Forces the correct outcome.

1258
01:20:13,901 --> 01:20:15,128
Rym: anyway restart the game, right?

1259
01:20:15,730 --> 01:20:20,050
Scott: It's like if though if the remaining people wanted to continue playing they're now forced to restart.

1260
01:20:20,271 --> 01:20:21,719
Scott: So it's like I didn't care about winning.

1261
01:20:22,162 --> 01:20:23,670
Scott: and not only didn't I care about winning?

1262
01:20:23,990 --> 01:20:29,550
Scott: I definitely didn't want to play three more hands or four more hands of cat in the box with that guy.

1263
01:20:29,911 --> 01:20:32,063
Rym: So I don't know if the game continued.

1264
01:20:32,163 --> 01:20:33,390
Rym: I suspect I don't know either.

1265
01:20:33,470 --> 01:20:45,410
Rym: I suspect the other players also forfeit or just gave up or were like like walked away because I Walked over like when I called over the enforcer I forfeited and it got up and I left before the officer got there.

1266
01:20:45,430 --> 01:20:46,113
Rym: So I like.

1267
01:20:46,233 --> 01:20:52,490
Rym: I went to pee after my game was over and then I like chatted at the table You're waiting for game to start and I walked away to do something else.

1268
01:20:52,892 --> 01:20:53,655
Rym: I came back like

1269
01:20:53,755 --> 01:20:54,418
Scott: pretty quick

1270
01:20:54,578 --> 01:21:05,502
Rym: because I wanted to watch like the last hand and Based on how long I know cat in the box takes the game should have still been going and the table was empty and I Was just like wow either Scott just wiped the floor with them.

1271
01:21:05,562 --> 01:21:07,710
Rym: I just assumed that you would like crush them or something.

1272
01:21:08,611 --> 01:21:10,156
Rym: And then I come over and you're like.

1273
01:21:10,497 --> 01:21:11,320
Rym: so I got a story.

1274
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:14,230
Scott: I guy came in last place in the finals I forfeited.

1275
01:21:15,053 --> 01:21:18,657
Scott: It's like I could have done worse but I feel like you know, I mean I could.

1276
01:21:18,697 --> 01:21:32,229
Scott: the alternative right was I could have sat there and been like I could have forfeited and Barrated the guy right and been like I am leaving because I don't want to play Three hands of cat in the box of the shitty person like you right, but that's only gonna get.

1277
01:21:32,249 --> 01:21:32,450
Scott: you know.

1278
01:21:32,530 --> 01:21:33,999
Scott: They're not gonna do that at PAX, right?

1279
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:41,665
Scott: There's something out, you know You know, I just got up and forfeited and like bye Right see GeekNights' panel on quitting, right?

1280
01:21:41,685 --> 01:21:44,953
Scott: It's like If it was this.

1281
01:21:45,013 --> 01:21:49,792
Scott: and the thing is if it was a super if it was that guy was taking it way too seriously Right.

1282
01:21:49,832 --> 01:21:57,450
Rym: Yeah, but if I was taking that tournament as seriously as that guy one you're in the right and two That's when the judge comes over and you raise your complaint, right?

1283
01:21:57,730 --> 01:21:58,052
Rym: And there's well.

1284
01:21:58,072 --> 01:22:01,170
Scott: the thing is I wouldn't have been if I was taking the tournament seriously.

1285
01:22:01,271 --> 01:22:03,221
Scott: I wouldn't have been calling for a reset.

1286
01:22:03,321 --> 01:22:05,030
Scott: I would have been calling for them to be disqualified.

1287
01:22:05,131 --> 01:22:06,056
Scott: They fucked something up.

1288
01:22:06,076 --> 01:22:07,122
Scott: They had four cards in the head.

1289
01:22:07,423 --> 01:22:08,590
Scott: They should be disqualified.

1290
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:10,401
Scott: It's a super serious business, right?

1291
01:22:10,642 --> 01:22:11,266
Scott: and you messed up.

1292
01:22:11,286 --> 01:22:12,472
Scott: you're gone right.

1293
01:22:12,873 --> 01:22:22,547
Scott: if it was like a magic tournament and I get the start of the hand like the other guy has like two cards instead Of the number he's supposed to I just make judge disqualify this guy and give him a loss at least right.

1294
01:22:22,587 --> 01:22:23,430
Scott: MIT forced to forfeit.

1295
01:22:23,430 --> 01:22:28,050
Scott: Right, because if it's a serious tournament, so it's like I didn't even go there with that guy.

1296
01:22:28,170 --> 01:22:34,458
Scott: Yeah, because it was a non serious tournament like calm down Nobody in history if that game had completed.

1297
01:22:34,679 --> 01:22:38,950
Scott: no one in history will remember or care who won cat in the box at PAX West.

1298
01:22:40,918 --> 01:22:42,323
Scott: So that's another story.

1299
01:22:42,364 --> 01:22:45,369
Scott: to help you with your gaming tournament.

1300
01:22:45,731 --> 01:22:48,199
Scott: Behavior code I guess so.

1301
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:48,801
Scott: etiquette.

1302
01:22:49,182 --> 01:22:51,430
Rym: I think we've gone on long enough.

1303
01:22:51,891 --> 01:22:52,694
Scott: We got this.

1304
01:22:52,714 --> 01:22:56,468
Scott: we gave you like three GeekNights worth episode only one show this week.

1305
01:22:56,528 --> 01:22:59,277
Scott: because of this Guys we didn't do.

1306
01:22:59,378 --> 01:23:00,945
Scott: we just did a huge GeekNights today.

1307
01:23:00,985 --> 01:23:01,326
Scott: That's it.

1308
01:23:01,407 --> 01:23:04,002
Scott: Yeah, and next week I think a lot we had a lot to go on.

1309
01:23:04,324 --> 01:23:04,787
Scott: we could have.

1310
01:23:04,928 --> 01:23:10,452
Scott: you know I could have just not told any of these things and held on to them and then forgotten them and they never be in a GeekNights.

1311
01:23:10,472 --> 01:23:11,336
Scott: Yeah, but now they are.

1312
01:23:11,617 --> 01:23:14,350
Rym: so yeah that I don't know what it is about our brains.

1313
01:23:14,430 --> 01:23:15,013
Rym: But geek dies.

1314
01:23:15,053 --> 01:23:17,121
Rym: what it's like my buffer gets cleared.

1315
01:23:17,161 --> 01:23:19,210
Rym: every time we do a show the cash is gone.

1316
01:23:21,790 --> 01:23:24,306
Scott: Sakurai just an episode about that on his little YouTube channel.

1317
01:23:24,426 --> 01:23:32,678
Rym: Oh I'll send it to you because I remember reading that the the doom door study of When you go there's a door.

1318
01:23:32,759 --> 01:23:34,690
Rym: Yeah when you go through door similar but different.

1319
01:23:35,092 --> 01:23:38,626
Rym: Yeah, you kind of forget the context of what was going on on the other side of that door.

1320
01:23:39,409 --> 01:23:43,316
Scott: Yep all right, so Pax is coming back.

1321
01:23:43,396 --> 01:23:43,938
Scott: I don't know.

1322
01:23:43,958 --> 01:23:51,238
Scott: The question is will the people come back enough to fill it the way they did before Without the huge triple-a industry presence?

1323
01:23:51,419 --> 01:24:00,126
Rym: because I gotta say this level of crowdedness at a PAX Regardless of how healthy that is for PAX and the industry and the future of like these conventions?

1324
01:24:00,648 --> 01:24:04,925
Rym: as an attendee This this was one of the better packs as I've ever been to like.

1325
01:24:04,965 --> 01:24:06,031
Rym: it felt like yeah 2008 2009 2010.

1326
01:24:06,031 --> 01:24:11,433
Rym: PAX West like it was here an expo hall Aficionado.

1327
01:24:11,493 --> 01:24:12,577
Scott: you'd be disappointed right?

1328
01:24:12,597 --> 01:24:18,076
Scott: there weren't that many big booths worth going to for triple even though for me This was a great expo hall.

1329
01:24:18,156 --> 01:24:19,240
Rym: I saw a game.

1330
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:19,862
Scott: I saw.

1331
01:24:19,982 --> 01:24:22,270
Scott: I saw a bunch of cool indie games.

1332
01:24:22,351 --> 01:24:34,543
Scott: Not too many I could have seen would have been nice to see more But I saw enough to wish list on Steam and then take business cards from and write down in my notes and then leave And that was enough right?

1333
01:24:34,583 --> 01:24:35,209
Scott: I need more than that.

1334
01:24:35,390 --> 01:24:38,370
Scott: But if you're looking for more than that, you would have been disappointed.

1335
01:24:38,410 --> 01:24:50,726
Rym: Yeah, if you want to wait in line if you were the average Pax East you would have hated this PAX West because one thing about this PAX West Tabletop was pretty full until the close.

1336
01:24:50,786 --> 01:24:55,963
Rym: every night PAX East like is empty after the expo hall closes.

1337
01:24:55,983 --> 01:25:02,190
Scott: Uh Well, I mean guess now, you know, there are times where it's hard to get a table at PAX East.

1338
01:25:02,296 --> 01:25:07,308
Rym: Yeah but generally our out like within an hour or two after the expo hall closing at PAX East.

1339
01:25:07,369 --> 01:25:11,509
Rym: because Almost everyone who goes to PAX East in our experience is one-day badge people.

1340
01:25:12,191 --> 01:25:14,504
Rym: PAX East kind of just empties out at night.

1341
01:25:14,786 --> 01:25:19,303
Scott: Hmm The tabletop zone does not which is where I work and you're also working.

1342
01:25:19,323 --> 01:25:20,125
Scott: so you don't see it then.

1343
01:25:20,246 --> 01:25:21,630
Scott: but that's you know It.

1344
01:25:21,651 --> 01:25:27,201
Scott: basically it is it facing when the expo hall closes from like six to you know Eight nine.

1345
01:25:27,261 --> 01:25:27,525
Scott: It's like.

1346
01:25:27,545 --> 01:25:33,310
Scott: it's like this There's like this prime time where it's full but then when it gets later not everyone's in there till midnight.

1347
01:25:33,390 --> 01:25:39,655
Scott: So when you start to get into like nine ten eleven twelve is when you'll get one walk like anywhere else in the con And it's just crickets.

1348
01:25:40,138 --> 01:25:41,444
Scott: Oh, yeah the rest of the con though.

1349
01:25:41,565 --> 01:25:49,850
Rym: Yeah That's this has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1350
01:25:49,910 --> 01:25:53,510
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and brand.

1351
01:25:53,590 --> 01:25:59,990
Scott: Okay for the logos be sure to visit our website at front row crew dot-com for show notes discussion news and more.

1355
01:26:15,731 --> 01:26:18,619
Scott: But unlike those other late shows it's actually recorded at night.

1356
01:26:18,900 --> 01:26:39,337
Rym: and the patreon patreons for this episode of GeekNights are Alan Joyce Linky G dread Lily Tenebrae case care makes music Chris Haddad Clinton Walton Dex thing Joel Hayes penny runs with Rebecca Dunn Sam Erickson Shervin Von Harl and a bunch of people who give us like a dollar I assume to get access to that sweet patreon RSS feed.

1357
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:44,462
Rym: so yeah unity shat itself and We haven't done a show for a bunch of reasons.

1358
01:26:44,502 --> 01:26:45,890
Rym: We're not gonna do any more shows this week.

1359
01:26:46,273 --> 01:26:56,633
Rym: So next week, we're gonna get back to a Tuesday Thursday and you might notice we did a Tuesday this week doing another Tuesday next week because we have decided that whenever we don't have a Great show idea.

1360
01:26:56,954 --> 01:26:59,580
Rym: We're gonna swap the days around a little bit.

1361
01:27:00,222 --> 01:27:20,704
Rym: But anyway for now, I'll just leave you with style brand new style.
