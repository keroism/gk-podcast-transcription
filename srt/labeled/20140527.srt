1
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:13,102
Rym: It's Tuesday, May 27th, 2014.

2
00:00:13,102 --> 00:00:13,603
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,724 --> 00:00:14,205
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,325 --> 00:00:15,649
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,709 --> 00:00:19,592
Rym: Tonight, Hanza to Tonica, a board game by Andreas Stedding.

6
00:00:22,895 --> 00:00:23,996
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:27,999 --> 00:00:32,168
Rym: Oh yeah, back from a weekend of pretty solid board gaming.

8
00:00:32,831 --> 00:00:33,473
Scott: And biking.

9
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:35,699
Rym: Yep, and biking, but also board gaming.

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,301
Scott: And eating.

11
00:00:36,321 --> 00:00:36,802
Scott: Yep.

12
00:00:37,324 --> 00:00:49,324
Rym: But we were at an awesome party, and suffice it to say, the pleasure of playing board games with intelligent people who take their turn quickly and try to win, cannot be understated.

13
00:00:50,247 --> 00:00:52,656
Rym: And more importantly, Scott, you didn't win any of those, did you?

14
00:00:52,676 --> 00:00:54,282
Rym: Did I win any?

15
00:00:54,343 --> 00:00:55,125
Rym: I don't think you won.

16
00:00:55,145 --> 00:00:58,959
Rym: Ro won by one point, and then I won by one point.

17
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,043
Scott: On Hanza to Tonica?

18
00:01:00,304 --> 00:01:01,710
Rym: Yeah, Hanza to Tonica mostly.

19
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:02,734
Scott: No, I didn't win that, no.

20
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:05,303
Rym: Yeah, we didn't play a lot of other games.

21
00:01:05,343 --> 00:01:06,949
Rym: We really focused on the Hanza to Tonica.

22
00:01:06,969 --> 00:01:11,346
Scott: I won the game that was basically Dominion Scrabble.

23
00:01:11,667 --> 00:01:19,286
Rym: Oh yeah, I remember that, I remember that, because in the next game, everyone who was in that game said that they will never play that game with you again, Mr.

24
00:01:19,306 --> 00:01:20,031
Rym: Won't Take His Turn.

25
00:01:20,051 --> 00:01:22,646
Scott: The same reason you won't play Street Fighter again with someone who kicks your ass.

26
00:01:22,706 --> 00:01:25,903
Rym: The same reason you won't play Acquire with Scott Johnson.

27
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:33,537
Scott: I'd like to point out that in that game, right, which is Scrabble with Dominion, I was sitting there taking a long time on my turn in order to make big plays.

28
00:01:33,738 --> 00:01:37,278
Rym: That is in fact the exact argument that Scott Johnson makes in a game of Acquire.

29
00:01:37,298 --> 00:01:39,850
Scott: You know what the other players were doing to play their turns so quickly?

30
00:01:40,614 --> 00:01:41,257
Rym: Not thinking.

31
00:01:41,679 --> 00:01:46,878
Scott: They were using their phones to basically look up fucking words and directly cheating.

32
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:51,340
Scott: That's like just, you're playing Scrabble and just pulling out the dictionary right in full view of everyone.

33
00:01:51,701 --> 00:01:56,380
Scott: Not to check or challenge a word someone tried to play, but to actually help you play a word.

34
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,288
Rym: Oh, that gave me the greatest trash talk.

35
00:01:58,469 --> 00:01:59,414
Scott: I was not doing that.

36
00:01:59,554 --> 00:02:03,370
Scott: I was thinking, and I beat them by tens of points.

37
00:02:03,571 --> 00:02:07,586
Rym: So, in that Viking show that I'm watching, there's the scene where two Vikings have a duel.

38
00:02:08,048 --> 00:02:14,256
Rym: So they come out with sword and shield, and the first guy looks at the guy, takes his shield, and just like fucking just throws it down.

39
00:02:14,276 --> 00:02:15,945
Rym: So what's the other guy gonna do?

40
00:02:16,026 --> 00:02:19,886
Rym: He either has to throw the shield down like the first guy or look like a coward.

41
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:22,357
Rym: So, when you're playing Scrabble with someone.

42
00:02:22,377 --> 00:02:30,770
Scott: I would just put my sword down and take out like a fucking Morningstar or one of those, a flail with a big spiky ball on it and be like, "I bet you want to pick up your shield now,

43
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:31,854
Scott: dumbass.".

44
00:02:32,355 --> 00:02:40,167
Rym: So, next time you're playing Scrabble with someone, if you're pretty sure you can beat them, sit down and hand them a dictionary and say, "By all

45
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:40,528
Rym: means.".

46
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:49,300
Scott: I use it as a general rule in any game whenever there's a fuck up or an asterisk, but we're not gonna reset or quit.

47
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:58,983
Scott: I just tell the, I either just let it go in the opponent's favor or I'll say, "You decide whatever you want to have and

48
00:02:59,003 --> 00:02:59,485
Scott: happens.".

49
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:00,568
Rym: I usually, I do that too.

50
00:03:00,588 --> 00:03:05,589
Rym: Sometimes there's a really minor fuck up, like on my turns, like did I take my extra point or not?

51
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,839
Rym: When in doubt, do the thing that hurts me the most.

52
00:03:08,643 --> 00:03:11,995
Scott: Like I was at the last Netrunner tournament I was at, the video, this is online.

53
00:03:12,036 --> 00:03:23,120
Scott: I basically won, but on the turn I won, I didn't do things slow enough and there was technically a chance for the opponent to not lose if he anticipated what I was doing or something, right?

54
00:03:23,221 --> 00:03:24,629
Scott: So, I was just like, "You know what?

55
00:03:24,649 --> 00:03:25,232
Scott: All right, fuck it.

56
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,102
Scott: You just write win or lose on that score sheet.

57
00:03:27,142 --> 00:03:27,544
Scott: It's up to you.

58
00:03:27,564 --> 00:03:27,745
Scott: I don't

59
00:03:27,765 --> 00:03:27,946
Scott: care.".

60
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:29,232
Rym: What do you write?

61
00:03:29,352 --> 00:03:29,613
Scott: Win.

62
00:03:30,254 --> 00:03:30,595
Rym: For you?

63
00:03:30,795 --> 00:03:31,156
Rym: For him.

64
00:03:31,497 --> 00:03:31,838
Rym: Really?

65
00:03:31,858 --> 00:03:32,339
Rym: Yeah.

66
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,041
Rym: Wow.

67
00:03:34,284 --> 00:03:34,625
Scott: Whatever.

68
00:03:34,645 --> 00:03:40,854
Scott: If I say that, I can't say, "Write whatever you want on the sheet," and then if they write that they win, then complain.

69
00:03:40,894 --> 00:03:48,329
Rym: Well, that just means that when you were telling him to write that, you did not prep him enough to coerce him into effectively writing what you wanted.

70
00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:49,274
Scott: I wasn't trying to coerce him.

71
00:03:49,294 --> 00:03:52,451
Scott: I was just like, "I just want to play the second game and go home quickly.

72
00:03:52,471 --> 00:03:54,519
Scott: Let's end this game now.

73
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:54,921
Scott: This game is

74
00:03:54,941 --> 00:03:55,202
Scott: slow.".

75
00:03:56,146 --> 00:04:01,475
Rym: So, I noticed something weird about Tom's and Teutonica in the board game geek thing that I'm going to figure out, but we'll get to that in the main bit.

76
00:04:01,857 --> 00:04:05,354
Rym: So, we're back trying to do GeekNights regularly until I fly off to Istanbul.

77
00:04:05,555 --> 00:04:12,024
Rym: So, in the news, you might know that we stopped playing Dungeons and Dragons quite some time ago at this point.

78
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:12,566
Rym: Yeah, a long time ago.

79
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:22,275
Rym: Back when we discovered the burning wheel and then unearthed the veritable treasure trove of indie RPGs, bespoke RPGs, RPGs that actually do what we wanted.

80
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:25,966
Scott: Tabletop RPGs of non-mainstreamness.

81
00:04:26,087 --> 00:04:28,616
Scott: And I'm still the RPG hipster would play.

82
00:04:28,757 --> 00:04:35,522
Rym: What's interesting is still, at this point in my life, I played D&D for more years than I played any of those indie RPGs.

83
00:04:35,543 --> 00:04:38,353
Scott: Well, those didn't exist or we didn't know about them.

84
00:04:38,433 --> 00:04:39,156
Rym: Yeah, exactly.

85
00:04:39,558 --> 00:04:42,410
Rym: So, D&D still has a really good place in my heart.

86
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:45,528
Rym: To this day, I remember a lot of bullshit about Dungeons and Dragons.

87
00:04:45,548 --> 00:04:51,374
Scott: Listen, if you want to walk around a dungeon and kill shit, D&D is not a bad game and sometimes I want to play that game.

88
00:04:51,514 --> 00:04:52,439
Rym: Yeah, but not even that.

89
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:58,282
Rym: I played a lot of second ed D&D, Advanced Dungeons and Dragons, which has its own interesting things going on.

90
00:04:58,925 --> 00:05:06,329
Rym: But, as you know, Wizards of the Coast has, over time, continued to make D&D, in my opinion at least, worse.

91
00:05:06,589 --> 00:05:08,779
Scott: Well, they just completely stopped for the dish.

92
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:13,439
Scott: It's like if they're not selling it currently or putting out products currently, they don't give a shit.

93
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:20,745
Rym: Well, remember, it was TSR who made poor financial decisions that eventually faced full life consequences.

94
00:05:20,765 --> 00:05:29,316
Rym: WotC bought them and I remember then, when Wizards of the Coast bought TSR, that all the D&D people were saying, "This is the end.

95
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:30,701
Rym: WotC's going to turn it into

96
00:05:30,762 --> 00:05:31,203
Rym: Magic.".

97
00:05:31,685 --> 00:05:32,468
Rym: And they didn't.

98
00:05:32,789 --> 00:05:34,679
Rym: They turned it into World of Warcraft.

99
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,544
Scott: Yeah, but anyway.

100
00:05:35,906 --> 00:05:42,295
Scott: But, yeah, it's like if they're not currently selling product for D&D, then they don't promote it and there's like nothing happening with it, right?

101
00:05:42,356 --> 00:05:44,065
Scott: Unlike Magic, which is always happening.

102
00:05:44,165 --> 00:05:49,389
Scott: So, it's like, because Magic doesn't really have, you know, versions where it's like they're not compatible.

103
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:51,023
Scott: It's just they keep putting out new cards all the time.

104
00:05:51,043 --> 00:05:52,472
Rym: Well, there are versions that aren't compatible.

105
00:05:52,813 --> 00:05:53,114
Scott: Right.

106
00:05:54,016 --> 00:05:54,478
Scott: Of Magic?

107
00:05:54,678 --> 00:05:54,999
Rym: Yes.

108
00:05:55,581 --> 00:05:57,768
Rym: You can't use your old cards in most tournaments.

109
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:01,222
Scott: No, but I mean, it's not like a different rule book.

110
00:06:01,263 --> 00:06:01,966
Rym: It kinda is.

111
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:03,695
Rym: A lot of the old rules have been superseded.

112
00:06:03,715 --> 00:06:05,466
Rym: The point is, there's just always new Magic cards.

113
00:06:05,486 --> 00:06:07,094
Scott: There isn't always new D&D, right?

114
00:06:07,275 --> 00:06:10,650
Rym: Well, because TSR experimented with that when they released those brown books.

115
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:12,620
Scott: In Magic, you're not selling the rule book.

116
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,584
Scott: That part is, right?

117
00:06:13,604 --> 00:06:14,710
Rym: That's the difference.

118
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,321
Rym: But the thing is, what else are you going to sell?

119
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:18,172
Rym: A lot of people who grew up playing D&D would make...

120
00:06:18,192 --> 00:06:24,535
Scott: They tried to sell miniatures and dice and adventures and character expansion books and all sorts of things.

121
00:06:24,555 --> 00:06:29,291
Scott: But anyway, so, in Third Ed, they had this open D20 system thing.

122
00:06:29,412 --> 00:06:33,725
Rym: Which, in my opinion, actually set role-playing games back.

123
00:06:34,648 --> 00:06:35,753
Rym: But that's only in retrospect.

124
00:06:35,774 --> 00:06:38,010
Rym: do I have that opinion, because at the time, I thought it was revolutionary.

125
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:38,550
Rym: Yeah.

126
00:06:38,772 --> 00:06:45,279
Rym: Basically, what it was, is they released a core set of rules, like the D20 system, and said, "Go nuts with this, guys.

127
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,876
Rym: You can't use a lot of our specific IP, like if we release a Forgotten Realms

128
00:06:48,896 --> 00:06:49,018
Rym: thing.".

129
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:50,050
Scott: You can't do any Beholder shit.

130
00:06:50,331 --> 00:06:50,594
Rym: Yup.

131
00:06:50,776 --> 00:06:51,850
Scott: Or Mind Flayer shit.

132
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:55,159
Rym: So, and then there was a Star Wars D20, there was an L5R D20, there were all these games.

133
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:03,501
Rym: The problem was, all those games had the same rules.

134
00:07:04,263 --> 00:07:09,402
Rym: Which seems great, but is actually terrible, because those games all felt the same.

135
00:07:09,442 --> 00:07:10,728
Rym: You just swap the proper nouns.

136
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:19,610
Rym: Once you realize that the Star Wars D20 looked, played, and felt identical to L5R D20, you basically didn't want to play any of them anymore.

137
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:25,028
Scott: It had extra rules for lightsabers and the Force, and also, uh, spaceships.

138
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,890
Rym: So, psionics and, uh, magic swords.

139
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:27,447
Scott: Spaceships.

140
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:28,053
Rym: Yeah.

141
00:07:28,276 --> 00:07:29,290
Rym: So, uh, spelljammers.

142
00:07:29,837 --> 00:07:30,007
Rym: Yeah.

143
00:07:32,531 --> 00:07:37,035
Rym: But it's interesting, because back then I remember thinking, "Wow, look how forward thinking and progressive they

144
00:07:37,136 --> 00:07:37,256
Rym: are.".

145
00:07:37,296 --> 00:07:43,301
Rym: But now, just in retrospect, knowing more about games and game design in the industry, I see this as the opposite.

146
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:47,777
Rym: But now, 4th edition, really, like Scott said, kind of just disappeared.

147
00:07:47,817 --> 00:07:51,768
Rym: I mean, in Australia, at PAX OS, they didn't even bring it.

148
00:07:52,210 --> 00:08:09,309
Scott: Yeah, and at PAX East, the only D&D that there was, that was, you know, there, was unofficial, 20-sided store, running 5th edition, like a few times a day, at their own booth, using like the preview rules that came out a long time ago.

149
00:08:09,671 --> 00:08:14,208
Rym: Now, well, let's see, well, TSR did experiment, Scott, with constantly selling D&D.

150
00:08:14,228 --> 00:08:15,549
Rym: Remember those Brown books?

151
00:08:17,155 --> 00:08:19,123
Rym: The Complete Guide to X?

152
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:20,750
Rym: The Psionics Handbook?

153
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:21,570
Scott: That's 2nd edition.

154
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:22,502
Rym: The Elephant Head, yeah.

155
00:08:22,522 --> 00:08:23,050
Rym: Dungeons and Dragons.

156
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,410
Scott: But how can you make new classes and new races all the time?

157
00:08:25,991 --> 00:08:26,233
Rym: Yup.

158
00:08:26,495 --> 00:08:28,110
Rym: Well, they, they also, you could have the model of...

159
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:36,570
Scott: You could treat it like World of Warcraft even more, whereas you keep adding new content at higher levels, but people don't actually have campaigns that keep going like that.

160
00:08:36,993 --> 00:08:37,869
Rym: Uh, I did.

161
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,717
Scott: Yeah, but I'm saying how many people do.

162
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:48,944
Scott: It's like, okay, here's all this content for levels 1-5, and then suddenly everyone in the world gets to level 5, and then you're like, okay, we're printing a whole bunch of new books now for levels 5-10, everyone.

163
00:08:48,964 --> 00:08:51,062
Scott: It's like, it doesn't work like that.

164
00:08:51,082 --> 00:08:51,670
Scott: It's not like...

165
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,229
Rym: I think that's what's gonna happen to Torchbearer.

166
00:08:53,612 --> 00:08:54,109
Scott: Yeah, maybe.

167
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,657
Rym: But I digress.

168
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,329
Rym: The news here now is that...

169
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,389
Scott: Torchbearer, you can't make it to level 5, dude.

170
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,070
Rym: Torchbearer, you can't make it back to town.

171
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:02,730
Scott: That's right.

172
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:32,622
Rym: So Dungeons and Dragons, which we've talked about at length on the show over the years, and it'd be interesting to see if someone took all the times we've talked about D&D and roleplaying games and strung them together into one episode just to see how our opinions have changed, but they're trying this again, and they're releasing the Dungeons and Dragons like starter set, this basic PDF that supposedly covers levels 1-20, Cleric Fighter, Rogue, Wizard classes, and the essential subclasses for each.

173
00:09:32,983 --> 00:09:37,689
Rym: It also provides the Dwarf, Elf, and Halfling as racial options alongside humans.

174
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:39,766
Scott: So it's first at D&D.

175
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:40,571
Rym: Yup.

176
00:09:40,752 --> 00:09:41,837
Rym: I think that it's interesting.

177
00:09:42,178 --> 00:09:46,054
Rym: D&D has almost been regressing back to an earlier state in some ways.

178
00:09:46,415 --> 00:09:52,450
Rym: They've, over time, what little roleplaying that was added to D&D seems to have been removed over time.

179
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,290
Scott: You mean the one sentence that says, "Please roleplay while playing this game"?

180
00:09:55,431 --> 00:09:55,674
Rym: Yup.

181
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:56,990
Rym: But simultaneously...

182
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,089
Scott: And make up your own rules, please.

183
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:07,646
Rym: They've been tightening up the rules around combat to the point that you can't just sort of fudge it and kind of make the combat roleplaying interesting like you could.

184
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:08,007
Rym: an old D&D.

185
00:10:08,028 --> 00:10:10,677
Rym: Not old as D&D, but second and third ed.

186
00:10:11,379 --> 00:10:14,650
Rym: So I don't really know who D&D is aimed at anymore.

187
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:26,249
Scott: It's aimed at people who just want to go into a dungeon and kill monsters and get loot and level up and play World of Warcraft at a table with friends to get those extra social aspects into it.

188
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,129
Rym: Ah, so I think there's something more subtle here.

189
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:36,950
Scott: Those people, in their mind, think they want roleplaying, but they don't actually, and they're getting what they want, but they're being lied to and told they're being given something else.

190
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:45,290
Rym: But at the same time, how many times do we talk about the gamer mystique of the people who say they're enjoying those D&D games, but quietly are just looking at their phone most of the time?

191
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:46,373
Scott: There are people like that, too.

192
00:10:46,434 --> 00:10:50,306
Scott: But I read a story about a study recently.

193
00:10:50,446 --> 00:10:56,956
Scott: I actually read the study, and it talked about how there's different parts of the brain for wanting things and actually liking them.

194
00:10:56,996 --> 00:10:59,229
Scott: And we can see this all the time with people we know.

195
00:10:59,309 --> 00:11:05,348
Scott: Emily talks about how whenever she plays a board game, it's super fun, but whenever she thinks about playing a board game, she doesn't want to.

196
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:08,230
Rym: Yep, which is a common complaint of many people.

197
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:08,851
Scott: Right.

198
00:11:09,052 --> 00:11:11,385
Scott: But as soon as she actually is playing it, she's like, "We need board

199
00:11:11,405 --> 00:11:12,049
Scott: games!"

200
00:11:12,109 --> 00:11:12,270
Scott: Right?

201
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:15,019
Scott: So I think that with D&D, I think there's a lot.

202
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:24,759
Scott: The people who play D&D a lot are people who, in their minds, want roleplaying and think they want roleplaying, but they don't actually like roleplaying.

203
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,651
Scott: What they like is go run a dungeon, kill things, and look up.

204
00:11:29,096 --> 00:11:34,919
Scott: But they don't know that they want that, and D&D basically sells them, telling them that D&D is what they want, so they buy it.

205
00:11:35,241 --> 00:11:41,130
Scott: And then once they play it, it's not what it was sold as, but it is what the person actually wants to do, truly.

206
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,937
Rym: I think it's more subtle than that.

207
00:11:42,977 --> 00:11:46,230
Rym: Because on one hand, how is D&D really sold to people?

208
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,867
Rym: How do people decide they want to play D&D?

209
00:11:49,451 --> 00:11:50,210
Scott: Based on their name?

210
00:11:50,491 --> 00:11:52,959
Rym: From nerdy, well, from history.

211
00:11:53,581 --> 00:11:55,588
Rym: From hearing about, like, "Oh, that's the roleplaying

212
00:11:55,608 --> 00:11:55,809
Rym: game."

213
00:11:56,451 --> 00:11:58,664
Rym: They're lucky if they even know there are other roleplaying games.

214
00:11:59,126 --> 00:12:00,312
Rym: From their uncles and whatever.

215
00:12:00,974 --> 00:12:03,944
Rym: And from the nerd media around it.

216
00:12:04,325 --> 00:12:06,071
Rym: What's one of the biggest examples of that?

217
00:12:06,332 --> 00:12:10,105
Rym: Wil Wheaton's stuff and Penny Arcade's Acquisitions Incorporated.

218
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:11,951
Rym: What do those focus on?

219
00:12:12,372 --> 00:12:22,506
Rym: People who are funny, playing the game in a funny and engaging manner, and most of what makes those games enjoyable is everything but the actual rules of D&D.

220
00:12:23,068 --> 00:12:25,999
Rym: It's the fact that Gabe and Tycho are just fucking hilarious people.

221
00:12:26,862 --> 00:12:35,559
Rym: And also, they get that idea that that's what D&D is like, and then when they play and it doesn't work out that way, what's the advice they get from other people in the community?

222
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,730
Rym: "Oh, you need a better game master.

223
00:12:38,251 --> 00:12:39,236
Rym: You need to roleplay

224
00:12:39,256 --> 00:12:39,457
Rym: better."

225
00:12:39,638 --> 00:12:47,115
Rym: They put the onus of failure on the person, so they try to improve themselves, not realizing that the game will basically never do that for them.

226
00:12:47,195 --> 00:12:48,621
Rym: It's a very complex thing.

227
00:12:48,842 --> 00:12:55,845
Rym: But I think you're right, a lot of people like the idea of D&D, but don't really know what they actually want from D&D.

228
00:12:56,447 --> 00:13:03,974
Rym: But this is subtly different from the D20 system, in that the D20 system was sold as a system that you could use to make your own commercial products.

229
00:13:05,057 --> 00:13:06,301
Rym: This is not that.

230
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:10,816
Rym: It's just a free PDF, so you don't have to buy the rulebook.

231
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:15,999
Scott: Before they had free speech, now they've gotten rid of free speech and replaced it with free beer.

232
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:16,602
Scott: See how that works.

233
00:13:16,783 --> 00:13:21,362
Rym: Now, they're not gonna include any content, which is fine, because I hate all their content now.

234
00:13:21,402 --> 00:13:24,957
Rym: And two, if they're not gonna include content, whatever.

235
00:13:24,997 --> 00:13:26,868
Scott: You don't like that giant spider lady?

236
00:13:26,888 --> 00:13:27,230
Rym: You know what?

237
00:13:27,491 --> 00:13:30,965
Rym: I already own all the books that tell me all the proper nouns.

238
00:13:31,005 --> 00:13:32,772
Scott: You don't like Two-Sword Guy?

239
00:13:33,394 --> 00:13:34,278
Rym: Oh, Artemis and Terrari?

240
00:13:34,318 --> 00:13:34,960
Rym: Fuck that guy.

241
00:13:35,021 --> 00:13:36,245
Scott: You don't like, um...

242
00:13:36,727 --> 00:13:37,209
Rym: Well, Drizzt?

243
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:38,736
Rym: Are you thinking of Drizzt or Artemis?

244
00:13:39,037 --> 00:13:39,398
Scott: I don't know.

245
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:40,604
Scott: The one you hate?

246
00:13:40,965 --> 00:13:42,411
Scott: I don't like either one of them.

247
00:13:42,532 --> 00:13:44,200
Scott: Incredibly powerful old wizard guy?

248
00:13:44,421 --> 00:13:45,305
Rym: Well, there's two.

249
00:13:45,365 --> 00:13:47,253
Rym: There's Kelvin Blackstaff and Al Minster.

250
00:13:47,414 --> 00:13:49,019
Scott: Yeah, both of them.

251
00:13:49,059 --> 00:13:49,662
Scott: Those guys.

252
00:13:50,725 --> 00:13:52,734
Rym: But I already have the books that tell me all that stuff.

253
00:13:52,754 --> 00:13:56,553
Rym: The only thing those books are missing is the stats that when I was young, we made up anyway.

254
00:13:57,917 --> 00:14:06,881
Rym: So, with this system, what's interesting is that they say, and I quote, "It is equivalent to the old Dungeons and Dragons rules

255
00:14:06,962 --> 00:14:07,824
Rym: cyclopedia.".

256
00:14:08,727 --> 00:14:11,596
Scott: That's a very large book to be given away for free.

257
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:13,464
Rym: Yeah, that book is huge.

258
00:14:13,624 --> 00:14:17,961
Rym: And also, you literally will never need any other materials to play D&D.

259
00:14:17,981 --> 00:14:21,674
Rym: So I'm not sure what they think they're going to be selling.

260
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:24,908
Scott: Yeah, that's not giving a little free sample of starter book.

261
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:25,771
Scott: That's like the book.

262
00:14:25,871 --> 00:14:30,928
Rym: This almost feels like a graceful exit from Dungeons and Dragons as a company.

263
00:14:31,129 --> 00:14:31,430
Scott: Maybe.

264
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:38,876
Rym: This is a way to keep the brand around so they can have the brand exist in case Hasbro wants to make some monies on it.

265
00:14:39,057 --> 00:14:46,108
Rym: Kind of like how, this is very obvious if you're not paying attention, the rights to Gem, the old cartoon, were in flux until relatively recently.

266
00:14:46,429 --> 00:14:48,278
Rym: But Hasbro effectively has them as far as I can tell.

267
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,187
Rym: They have not re-released Gem.

268
00:14:50,669 --> 00:14:57,474
Rym: They've taken My Little Pony and they've taken a lot of the aspects of what Gem is and made a spin off My Little Pony show.

269
00:14:57,494 --> 00:14:58,417
Rym: that's basically Gem.

270
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:14,357
Rym: Because they call it brand confluence, where you can have one brand name and brand iconography and have many properties under it to simplify your marketing budget and to simplify your, just basically everything in your company outward facing in social media.

271
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,968
Rym: It makes the brand more powerful as a whole.

272
00:15:17,048 --> 00:15:18,334
Rym: You can target different demographics.

273
00:15:19,017 --> 00:15:20,202
Rym: I think this is the same thing.

274
00:15:20,242 --> 00:15:22,772
Rym: This is Hasbro saying, "You guys fucked up.

275
00:15:23,435 --> 00:15:25,985
Rym: We can't get rid of the brand because the brand's too powerful.

276
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:34,094
Rym: This is the cheapest way to keep the brand as big as possible in a holding pattern until we come up with a new way to monetize

277
00:15:34,175 --> 00:15:34,235
Rym: it.".

278
00:15:35,741 --> 00:15:36,665
Rym: That's just my guess.

279
00:15:36,785 --> 00:15:37,910
Rym: I have no insider knowledge.

280
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:40,797
Scott: Yeah, I mean that very well could be.

281
00:15:40,817 --> 00:15:44,871
Scott: They might just be like, "All right, this D&D never made

282
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:45,193
Scott: money.".

283
00:15:45,815 --> 00:15:51,201
Scott: I was thinking that they were basically, I was under the assumption that Fifth Edition is basically their last try.

284
00:15:51,482 --> 00:15:56,648
Scott: Like, "All right, if this doesn't work, we're not doing D&D anymore because this shit ain't profitable and Hasbro's going to cut it

285
00:15:56,728 --> 00:15:56,849
Scott: off.".

286
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:00,626
Rym: The brand is too well known to let die or let someone else have it.

287
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:02,998
Rym: Imagine if Luke Crane got a hold of the D&D license.

288
00:16:03,038 --> 00:16:11,737
Scott: Right, but now what you say makes me think that maybe what they're doing is just to keep the brand alive, making a product that's just like, "Okay, this is D&D.

289
00:16:11,817 --> 00:16:17,840
Scott: It's this set of books," and not doing this whole universe of products and making a whole bunch of garbage.

290
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,869
Scott: Just be like, "Okay, this is D&D.

291
00:16:19,929 --> 00:16:20,552
Scott: It's on the shelf.

292
00:16:20,652 --> 00:16:22,258
Scott: We'll leave it there forever just to hold its

293
00:16:22,298 --> 00:16:23,362
Scott: spot.".

294
00:16:23,623 --> 00:16:26,055
Scott: Players Handbook, Masters Guide, Monster Manual.

295
00:16:26,095 --> 00:16:31,263
Rym: But they're giving away for free, so I think it's also kind of trying to inoculate the market against competitors.

296
00:16:32,347 --> 00:16:39,781
Rym: because D&D is still, literally, unless you listen to this show, you probably have no idea that other role-playing systems even exist.

297
00:16:39,802 --> 00:16:40,490
Scott: Pathfinder's pretty big.

298
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:47,168
Rym: It is, but even then, it is popular among the nerds among nerds.

299
00:16:47,188 --> 00:16:49,858
Rym: Go to someone on the street and say, "Hey, do you know about role-playing

300
00:16:49,898 --> 00:16:50,199
Rym: games?".

301
00:16:50,501 --> 00:16:52,188
Rym: If they say anything other than,

302
00:16:52,369 --> 00:16:52,569
Rym: "What?"

303
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,240
Rym: or, "Get away from me," they'll say, "Oh,

304
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:54,541
Rym: D&D.".

305
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:57,075
Scott: Or Final Fantasy.

306
00:16:57,356 --> 00:16:58,139
Rym: Yep, Final Fantasy.

307
00:16:58,199 --> 00:16:58,661
Rym: JRPGs.

308
00:16:58,681 --> 00:16:59,243
Rym: Transistor.

309
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:01,918
Scott: All right, so another news.

310
00:17:01,978 --> 00:17:03,148
Scott: That news took way too long, so...

311
00:17:03,551 --> 00:17:04,334
Rym: I warned you it would.

312
00:17:04,756 --> 00:17:06,282
Scott: Anyway, Nintendo, right?

313
00:17:06,544 --> 00:17:09,441
Scott: They're bombing lately, so they need to get some monies.

314
00:17:10,025 --> 00:17:10,709
Scott: For a long time...

315
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:12,436
Rym: Wouldn't you say bob-bombing?

316
00:17:12,718 --> 00:17:13,000
Scott: Sure.

317
00:17:13,803 --> 00:17:16,233
Scott: For a long time, they've been being really annoying on YouTube.

318
00:17:16,616 --> 00:17:21,637
Scott: If you upload a YouTube Nintendo video, Nintendo yoinks that and gets your ad revenues, right?

319
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:30,418
Scott: I guess they share the ad revenue with YouTube, but they're trying to scrape up any money they can, and this is why people love Twitch and why they're kind of slightly worried.

320
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:44,370
Scott: One of the reasons they're worried that YouTube bought Twitch is because on Twitch, you can just put up a video of a Nintendo game, no problem, but on YouTube, Nintendo's going to claim ownership of that video if you plan Mario 1, put ads on it, and take money from it, which is annoying.

321
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,798
Rym: Annoying and, I think, unethical.

322
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:50,435
Scott: Sure, but Nintendo needs every penny it can get, because they're fucked.

323
00:17:50,656 --> 00:17:54,835
Rym: I firmly believe that me playing a game is a unique performance of that game.

324
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:55,657
Scott: Sure.

325
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:10,430
Scott: But anyway, Nintendo, today, there were like two tweets on the official Japanese Twitter account, so all the details aren't out yet, basically, because it's only so many characters' worth, but they're going to have a new affiliate.

326
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,081
Rym: I clicked on the tweets like, "Oh, I'll read them.

327
00:18:12,142 --> 00:18:12,646
Rym: Yeah, it's in

328
00:18:12,787 --> 00:18:13,190
Rym: Japanese.".

329
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,317
Scott: It's in moon language, right, yeah.

330
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,714
Scott: But you can say a lot more in fucking moon language than you can say.

331
00:18:18,477 --> 00:18:18,819
Rym: I can't.

332
00:18:18,999 --> 00:18:20,465
Rym: There's so much kanji.

333
00:18:20,706 --> 00:18:21,710
Rym: I can't read this at all.

334
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,936
Scott: Yeah, but you can say a lot in a few tweets, right?

335
00:18:24,618 --> 00:18:29,554
Scott: Anyway, in Japanese, they're going to have a new affiliate.

336
00:18:29,574 --> 00:18:32,216
Scott: They're going to keep that affiliate program alive, where they just take your money.

337
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,553
Rym: All right, so they're keeping the bad thing going.

338
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:43,530
Scott: But they're also going to start an alternative thing where you basically partner with them in an affiliate program, and then I don't know if you had to put ads actually in your video directly or what.

339
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,136
Rym: They'll do the YouTube ones, I guarantee.

340
00:18:45,317 --> 00:18:57,399
Scott: Or something, but basically, if you join the program and Nintendo approves your videos, then you put them up, and not only does Nintendo get money and YouTube gets money, but you also get money.

341
00:18:58,182 --> 00:19:04,510
Scott: So if you go through them first, and of course, if they don't like your video, it's not going to get put up on YouTube.

342
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:07,278
Rym: This is anathema to freedom of expression.

343
00:19:08,262 --> 00:19:11,113
Rym: It's one of those dying grasps of a company that's failing.

344
00:19:11,133 --> 00:19:21,090
Scott: It's like, if you want to put a video up on YouTube about our stuff, then you have to make sure that we get some of the money, and maybe if you're really nice to us, we'll give you a little bit of the money also.

345
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:26,890
Rym: All right, so what's the difference, Nintendo, between a parody, a review, a let's play?

346
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:38,209
Scott: Right, and then on top of that, Mario Kart 8 is going to have YouTube integration, so I don't know if that's going to connect you to this thing by default.

347
00:19:38,651 --> 00:19:49,302
Rym: Knowing Nintendo, what that's going to do is if you share a friend code with someone, you can make a video of yourself playing, and then they'll see it, but it removes any audio and replaces it with music.

348
00:19:49,403 --> 00:19:50,330
Scott: Who knows what's going to happen.

349
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,870
Rym: Oh, and if you don't have someone's friend code, you can't see their videos.

350
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:53,551
Scott: We'll see.

351
00:19:59,983 --> 00:20:02,347
Rym: So things of the day.

352
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:05,377
Rym: This is cute, and I had a much more depressing thing.

353
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:08,151
Rym: I decided not to jump down all you guys' throats yet with.

354
00:20:08,753 --> 00:20:14,470
Rym: This is just a cool animation about an encounter with a dancing witch in Minecraft.

355
00:20:15,071 --> 00:20:15,816
Rym: It's pretty funny.

356
00:20:16,158 --> 00:20:17,164
Rym: It's got good dubstep.

357
00:20:17,386 --> 00:20:17,889
Rym: I enjoyed it.

358
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:19,618
Scott: It's cute, but whatevs.

359
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,444
Scott: Typical internet whatevs.

360
00:20:21,832 --> 00:20:23,201
Rym: What do you think things of the day are for?

361
00:20:23,241 --> 00:20:24,590
Rym: It's the best thing I saw in the last day.

362
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,352
Scott: That's not much.

363
00:20:26,196 --> 00:20:27,120
Scott: So check out this dude.

364
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,650
Scott: He's going biking on a trail in a national park.

365
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,018
Scott: I don't even know what fucking country it is.

366
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:32,205
Scott: It doesn't matter, right?

367
00:20:32,466 --> 00:20:36,042
Scott: They speak English there, whatever country, or he speaks English.

368
00:20:36,524 --> 00:20:37,890
Scott: He's biking through the park along a trail.

369
00:20:38,312 --> 00:20:41,404
Scott: looks like a nice trail, not very hilly, you know, nice.

370
00:20:41,524 --> 00:20:46,003
Scott: It's dirt, but it's pretty hard packed, easy to ride on, right?

371
00:20:46,023 --> 00:20:50,698
Scott: And as he's going through the park, he comes across some cars and then some people.

372
00:20:51,521 --> 00:20:57,520
Scott: And then, oh my God, it's just the surprise random rave in the woods that probably doesn't belong there.

373
00:20:58,404 --> 00:21:02,869
Scott: And he says some funny stuff and he sees some funny stuff with, I assume, what is a GoPro camera.

374
00:21:04,331 --> 00:21:08,968
Scott: So, uh, I, you know, I really identified with this cause a lot of times.

375
00:21:08,988 --> 00:21:16,885
Scott: we're biking through New York and you know, it's not sudden unofficial rave, but it's just like, oh, look at this thing that I did not expect to be here on this day.

376
00:21:16,925 --> 00:21:17,268
Scott: Here it is.

377
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:17,791
Rym: Yup.

378
00:21:18,453 --> 00:21:23,073
Rym: I mean that Kickstarter block party, I kind of forgot it was happening and we biked past it.

379
00:21:23,093 --> 00:21:24,889
Rym: We're like, what the fuck is going on over there?

380
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:25,591
Scott: Yup.

381
00:21:25,933 --> 00:21:27,359
Scott: That happens all the goddamn time.

382
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:32,149
Scott: So it was, it's funny to see it happen in the middle of the woods as opposed to the most important city on earth.

383
00:21:32,773 --> 00:21:36,010
Rym: So in the meta moment, the book club book is a canticle for Lebowitz.

384
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:36,808
Scott: I started reading it.

385
00:21:37,131 --> 00:21:39,170
Rym: I will start reading it probably on my flight to Istanbul.

386
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:39,786
Rym: Okay.

387
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:40,291
Rym: Yeah.

388
00:21:41,014 --> 00:21:42,380
Rym: Uh, we had a bunch of YouTube videos.

389
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:44,368
Rym: Kinetic Con is coming up in July.

390
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:45,433
Rym: You should totally go.

391
00:21:45,453 --> 00:21:51,776
Rym: A good chunk of the schedule for panels and workshops and guests and things is already up on the website.

392
00:21:52,959 --> 00:21:55,265
Rym: And I am told we'll have guide book.

393
00:21:55,285 --> 00:21:58,316
Rym: I don't know if I'm supposed to announce that, but whatever.

394
00:21:58,336 --> 00:22:02,535
Rym: If we don't have it, I want you to complain to Con asking why we don't have it.

395
00:22:03,057 --> 00:22:04,662
Rym: Pretty sure we got it now.

396
00:22:04,803 --> 00:22:05,184
Rym: Yeah.

397
00:22:05,626 --> 00:22:11,715
Rym: And I don't want like to use GeekNights as like a mouthpiece for this guide book to actually rate panels and our panels.

398
00:22:11,795 --> 00:22:17,443
Rym: We are going to be doing ourselves one complaint we've gotten over the years that we don't do enough of our own stuff at the con.

399
00:22:17,584 --> 00:22:18,428
Rym: Who's complaining about that.

400
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:21,205
Rym: People have asked me listeners, they're like, Hey, what's a kinetic con?

401
00:22:21,245 --> 00:22:24,100
Scott: And you guys, so we'll do five more panels that have three people attending them.

402
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:25,105
Scott: Yeah.

403
00:22:25,446 --> 00:22:32,332
Rym: Well, the problem is I usually, because, you know, we do more stuff, attend more because we schedule the whole con.

404
00:22:33,034 --> 00:22:35,221
Rym: We're also busy doing con stuff.

405
00:22:35,682 --> 00:22:44,656
Rym: So for example, it's, it's kind of unethical for me to schedule it myself in the large room at prime time, especially when I have like 10 other big things I could put there.

406
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:52,159
Rym: Secondly, I know that I'll show up wherever I schedule it and I have time slots that are bad.

407
00:22:52,620 --> 00:23:02,674
Rym: So I tend to put our stuff early in the day and I know it's hard to get other similarly good people to go and I know we'll actually show up and do it.

408
00:23:02,975 --> 00:23:08,364
Rym: So there's at least something good in those slots, but we are going to do, we're going to do our bad games and we're going to do our wine.

409
00:23:08,405 --> 00:23:09,271
Rym: No one will game with you.

410
00:23:09,572 --> 00:23:09,873
Rym: Okay.

411
00:23:10,154 --> 00:23:11,078
Rym: Maybe a third one.

412
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,484
Rym: We'll see how to win every game.

413
00:23:13,066 --> 00:23:13,950
Scott: Maybe because we need more.

414
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:14,915
Scott: What does the con need?

415
00:23:14,955 --> 00:23:16,202
Scott: Does it need more gaming content?

416
00:23:16,222 --> 00:23:17,450
Rym: It needs more anime content.

417
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:18,333
Scott: Let's do an anime.

418
00:23:18,413 --> 00:23:19,457
Rym: What do you want to do?

419
00:23:19,477 --> 00:23:23,554
Rym: Which, which of our stale ass anime panels do you want to recycle?

420
00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:26,308
Scott: Well, for anime Boston, we did the spring chart.

421
00:23:26,348 --> 00:23:30,283
Rym: Maybe we can do the summer chart because that's, that's so much work to put together.

422
00:23:30,303 --> 00:23:32,050
Rym: You want to put it together?

423
00:23:32,731 --> 00:23:34,217
Rym: You want to do what I did for the last two?

424
00:23:34,438 --> 00:23:34,920
Rym: Go nuts.

425
00:23:35,342 --> 00:23:35,643
Scott: Maybe.

426
00:23:36,386 --> 00:23:42,185
Rym: But yeah, anyway, kinetic con is super awesome and you should attend it because it's pretty awesome.

427
00:23:42,506 --> 00:23:50,873
Rym: But if you submitted a panel and I've gotten no emails from the website yet, I suggest you log into your account.

428
00:23:50,933 --> 00:23:53,604
Rym: You might see your panel either accepted or rejected.

429
00:23:53,885 --> 00:23:57,420
Rym: There was an issue preventing emails from being automatically sent out a while ago.

430
00:23:57,822 --> 00:23:59,227
Rym: that has since been resolved.

431
00:23:59,488 --> 00:23:59,669
Rym: Okay.

432
00:24:01,671 --> 00:24:02,274
Scott: Any other metas?

433
00:24:02,615 --> 00:24:02,977
Rym: Not really.

434
00:24:03,158 --> 00:24:04,927
Scott: Go on the internet and find us and follow us.

435
00:24:04,947 --> 00:24:08,870
Scott: I mean, how could you, if you're listening to this podcast, you've already found us and followed us, right?

436
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:12,300
Scott: So tell your friends to listen to GeekNights.

437
00:24:12,802 --> 00:24:13,966
Rym: And also join the forum.

438
00:24:14,086 --> 00:24:18,304
Rym: I see a lot of you lurking, but fewer people are posting recently.

439
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:19,007
Rym: Maybe because it's one now.

440
00:24:19,027 --> 00:24:20,113
Scott: Are you not an important person?

441
00:24:20,133 --> 00:24:21,078
Scott: You don't have anything to say.

442
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:21,480
Rym: Yeah.

443
00:24:21,721 --> 00:24:23,370
Rym: I mean, you're not going to join one of these arguments.

444
00:24:24,111 --> 00:24:24,960
Scott: Illiterate?

445
00:24:25,081 --> 00:24:25,708
Rym: I don't know.

446
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:32,272
Rym: So Hans and Teutonica, we pointedly waited to do this review because for a while, well, Rym waited.

447
00:24:32,332 --> 00:24:33,055
Scott: I was fine doing it.

448
00:24:33,175 --> 00:24:33,356
Scott: Yeah.

449
00:24:33,436 --> 00:24:45,220
Rym: But we've lately just due to constraints of time and due to feeling very self-assured in our ability to assess games quickly have been reviewing games, especially tabletop games based on one playthrough.

450
00:24:45,281 --> 00:24:46,123
Scott: Sometimes that's enough.

451
00:24:46,404 --> 00:24:46,645
Rym: Yup.

452
00:24:47,367 --> 00:24:47,990
Rym: And you know what?

453
00:24:48,391 --> 00:24:50,677
Scott: Koo, C-O-U-P, one play was enough.

454
00:24:51,219 --> 00:24:56,495
Rym: In the case of Hans and Teutonica, one play through was also enough, but I had to be sure.

455
00:24:56,515 --> 00:24:56,595
Rym: Okay.

456
00:24:57,277 --> 00:25:00,447
Rym: I wanted to give a real deep review of this game.

457
00:25:00,467 --> 00:25:02,153
Scott: I haven't played it enough to go really deep.

458
00:25:02,455 --> 00:25:03,519
Rym: We can go deep enough.

459
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:04,523
Scott: Like four or five times.

460
00:25:04,543 --> 00:25:05,768
Rym: We have not solved it.

461
00:25:05,869 --> 00:25:07,632
Rym: However, I can say this.

462
00:25:07,732 --> 00:25:10,119
Rym: Hans and Teutonica came out in 2009.

463
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:22,555
Rym: Andrea Stedding is a stand-up tabletop game that is quick to play, quick to teach, and has survived repeated plays with experienced and skilled gamers.

464
00:25:23,237 --> 00:25:26,970
Rym: That is more than I can say for most tabletop games that have ever existed.

465
00:25:27,431 --> 00:25:29,649
Rym: That's more than I can say for most tabletop games that I own.

466
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:40,150
Scott: I think the fundamental thing with Hans and Teutonica, right, is you look at a lot of board games out there that have multiple victory conditions or multiple ways, paths to generating victory points.

467
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:45,250
Rym: Like Kalis, you can go in the castle, you can try to do the gold thing, you can try to do the buildings thing.

468
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:50,530
Scott: And in most of those games, in most of those games, one way is just better than the other way.

469
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,538
Rym: In Kalis, you should just go for the castle.

470
00:25:52,618 --> 00:25:53,622
Rym: Fuck everything else.

471
00:25:53,823 --> 00:25:54,105
Scott: Right.

472
00:25:54,205 --> 00:25:56,094
Scott: Unless you get some magic jeweler thing happen.

473
00:25:56,114 --> 00:25:57,882
Rym: And even then, he lost by a point.

474
00:25:57,922 --> 00:25:58,906
Rym: Like, it still didn't work.

475
00:25:58,967 --> 00:25:59,690
Rym: It was just close.

476
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:08,778
Scott: But in the five, six times I played Hans and Teutonica, right, all ways are not necessarily viable in a single instance of the game.

477
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:17,210
Scott: But, across playing the game multiple times, based on what people do, different ones will become the way you should have gone.

478
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:20,950
Scott: Like, if the game is going long, then the key becomes the way to go.

479
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:23,281
Rym: The key and the network and building houses.

480
00:26:23,341 --> 00:26:25,050
Rym: But, that means you need your Pribilica Pop.

481
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:32,230
Scott: If the game is really short, right, then like one colon might be enough to win.

482
00:26:32,511 --> 00:26:37,430
Rym: You and Cold Guy learned that when me and Ro just fucking blitzed the end of the game and left everybody behind.

483
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:37,990
Rym: Yeah.

484
00:26:38,091 --> 00:26:43,410
Scott: And it's like, you get like these piddly points, like during the course of the game, just from building offices.

485
00:26:44,111 --> 00:26:48,610
Scott: And it's like, those points usually don't matter if people get a whole bunch of end of game points.

486
00:26:48,751 --> 00:26:51,989
Scott: But, if you can get enough of those points quickly enough, the game will just fucking end.

487
00:26:52,731 --> 00:26:56,530
Scott: And then, those end of game points will be so insignificant compared to the during game points.

488
00:26:57,052 --> 00:27:02,790
Scott: So, it's like, not only do you have to choose a path of victory, but you have to see how the game is going.

489
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:06,130
Scott: And, if there's a lot of players, you don't have a lot of control over how the game is going.

490
00:27:06,531 --> 00:27:11,410
Scott: And, you have to play for the path that is going to be the winning path in that game.

491
00:27:11,651 --> 00:27:13,690
Scott: And, not end Hans Deutonica overall.

492
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:17,650
Rym: That is what makes this game so fascinating to me and why I have such a high opinion of it.

493
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:20,770
Rym: Because, let's look at two similar, like two different directions of game.

494
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:24,150
Rym: Agricola has the same, there are multiple paths to victory.

495
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,609
Scott: But, you just get the baby.

496
00:27:26,074 --> 00:27:26,317
Rym: Yep.

497
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:27,610
Rym: Well, get the baby, yeah.

498
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:30,670
Rym: But, there's other, like, do you go for house upgrade points?

499
00:27:31,312 --> 00:27:32,450
Rym: Or, do you go for animal points?

500
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:34,189
Scott: Well, your cards usually tell you what to do.

501
00:27:34,952 --> 00:27:37,470
Scott: And, the resources available usually tell you what to do.

502
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:41,030
Scott: And, you sort of have to do a little bit of everything to get a good score in that game anyway.

503
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:41,792
Rym: Exactly.

504
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:45,370
Rym: So, you have two things affecting the game in a sense.

505
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:49,290
Rym: On one hand, your strategy is driven, what?

506
00:27:49,411 --> 00:27:51,530
Rym: By your preference and your cards.

507
00:27:52,111 --> 00:27:54,250
Rym: Not so much by what anyone else is doing.

508
00:27:54,812 --> 00:28:00,650
Rym: So, if I see Scott's going for a house upgrade, that almost doesn't affect my strategy at all.

509
00:28:00,731 --> 00:28:03,050
Scott: Unless you were going for house upgrade and now I'm taking it from you.

510
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:05,090
Rym: Even then, usually you're not taking it from me.

511
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:08,070
Rym: Because, the game's set up for two people doing the same thing isn't too big.

512
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:10,022
Scott: There's enough for two people to do the same thing.

513
00:28:10,042 --> 00:28:11,150
Scott: There's not enough for three people.

514
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:11,470
Rym: Nope.

515
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:16,950
Rym: The only game interaction though, it comes down to blocking Scott's move at a critical point.

516
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:18,436
Rym: Oh, you wanted to build the baby.

517
00:28:18,476 --> 00:28:19,039
Rym: Well, guess what?

518
00:28:19,099 --> 00:28:19,783
Rym: I'm on the baby.

519
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,229
Rym: You can't build the baby this turn.

520
00:28:22,215 --> 00:28:24,750
Rym: That kind of blocking other players is all that matters.

521
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:33,350
Rym: And two, the game has extremely diminishing returns in every victory point direction, forcing you to do all of them at least a little.

522
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:40,410
Rym: Now, going the other direction, a game like El Grande has the direct player fucking, the direct player interaction.

523
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:45,570
Rym: Everything I do directly relates to what you do and before and after what I do.

524
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:47,910
Rym: I move some pieces there, you have to react to that.

525
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:49,518
Rym: The game is so reactive.

526
00:28:49,538 --> 00:28:51,930
Rym: Your strategy has to be so high level in meta.

527
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:54,370
Rym: But as a result, the game is almost purely political.

528
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:59,244
Rym: Hansa Teutonica has the direct interaction.

529
00:28:59,284 --> 00:29:00,890
Rym: The game is extremely reactionary.

530
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:09,490
Rym: Your strategy mostly has to revolve around reacting to other players on a tactical level and maybe changing strategies mid-game.

531
00:29:10,471 --> 00:29:14,570
Rym: But at the same time, you still have this solitaire sort of build-up optimization.

532
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:22,330
Rym: It takes the best aspects of a game like Agricola and the best aspects of a game like El Grande, mashes them together into something that's actually really quick to play.

533
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:27,006
Scott: Right, so the way the game works generally is that you have cubes and discs.

534
00:29:27,246 --> 00:29:28,230
Scott: Fuck with their actual name.

535
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:29,435
Rym: Oh, yeah, actually we got it.

536
00:29:29,717 --> 00:29:32,110
Rym: So, problem with this game.

537
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,350
Scott: The rulebook is garbage.

538
00:29:33,991 --> 00:29:36,890
Rym: We complain about rulebooks and tabletop games being poorly written for the last decade.

539
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:38,230
Scott: It's not as bad as Attica.

540
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:38,683
Rym: No.

541
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:39,709
Scott: Not Attica.

542
00:29:42,415 --> 00:29:42,687
Scott: Hellas.

543
00:29:42,813 --> 00:29:43,106
Scott: Hellas.

544
00:29:43,471 --> 00:29:44,485
Scott: It's not as bad as Hellas.

545
00:29:44,525 --> 00:29:44,890
Rym: Attica's fine.

546
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:45,770
Rym: Attica's got fine rules.

547
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:46,256
Rym: Attica's fine.

548
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:47,070
Scott: Hellas is the best.

549
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:57,230
Rym: Read the rules in old games like Puerto Rico or Tigger's New Freighties or Bonanza and then read the rules of Hansa Teutonica and I defy you not to try to shoot yourself in the face.

550
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:58,135
Scott: Right, so there's one piece.

551
00:29:58,175 --> 00:30:00,650
Scott: The disc is called a merchant and the cube is called a trader.

552
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:01,146
Scott: Okay.

553
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:02,550
Scott: How the fuck are you going to keep that straight?

554
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:07,129
Rym: Well, do you draw them from your stockpile of merchant traders or your supply?

555
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:09,461
Scott: My supply or my stockpile?

556
00:30:09,844 --> 00:30:10,005
Scott: No.

557
00:30:10,307 --> 00:30:10,690
Scott: Fuck that.

558
00:30:10,791 --> 00:30:12,550
Scott: We called it the disc and the cube.

559
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:15,650
Scott: And we called it the graveyard and the whatever.

560
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:17,260
Rym: The graveyard and the supply.

561
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,530
Rym: No, the graveyard and the bag.

562
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:19,288
Scott: The bag.

563
00:30:19,531 --> 00:30:20,669
Rym: And the general term.

564
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:21,489
Scott: The bag is an action.

565
00:30:21,891 --> 00:30:22,756
Rym: And the general term.

566
00:30:22,817 --> 00:30:24,889
Rym: Discs and cubes collectively are dudes.

567
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:31,610
Rym: So, for example, you must play a disc on this place, but you may return a dude from your supply.

568
00:30:31,713 --> 00:30:31,923
Rym: Yeah.

569
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:33,849
Rym: Meaning either a disc or a cube.

570
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,010
Rym: Yeah.

571
00:30:35,271 --> 00:30:37,264
Rym: Seriously, don't like the rulebook.

572
00:30:37,284 --> 00:30:38,170
Rym: Just cross out.

573
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:41,849
Scott: There are problems with the rulebook besides the fact that it names things weirdly.

574
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:51,930
Scott: That we had this game taught to us by multiple people multiple times and they all got shit wrong until Rym read the rules extremely carefully and referred to BoardGameGeek multiple times.

575
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:55,590
Rym: And while I was reading them was repeatedly swearing out loud.

576
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:56,386
Scott: Yes.

577
00:30:57,412 --> 00:30:59,530
Scott: We might even still be playing it wrong, but I doubt it.

578
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:00,610
Rym: Yeah, I think we're pretty good now.

579
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:06,070
Scott: So, anyway, the way the game works is that you have dudes, cubes and discs, right?

580
00:31:06,292 --> 00:31:07,950
Scott: And you put them on the board on these roads.

581
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:09,869
Scott: And each road has a number of spaces.

582
00:31:10,531 --> 00:31:14,290
Scott: Once you've filled it, it takes, you know, actions to get guys out there and fill up a road.

583
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:15,669
Scott: But eventually you fill up a road.

584
00:31:16,192 --> 00:31:18,449
Scott: Then you can use an action to score the road.

585
00:31:18,991 --> 00:31:23,750
Scott: When you score the road, you can usually just put one of your dudes at the end of the road.

586
00:31:23,911 --> 00:31:24,863
Rym: Either end if there's two ends.

587
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:26,469
Scott: Every road has two ends.

588
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:27,569
Scott: Except for the ending roads.

589
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:28,587
Rym: Those have two ends.

590
00:31:29,432 --> 00:31:30,449
Scott: Yeah, every road has two ends.

591
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:31,067
Rym: They have two.

592
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:32,066
Scott: Yeah, I guess so.

593
00:31:33,819 --> 00:31:34,170
Scott: But anyway.

594
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:38,970
Scott: And then you put your guy, one of your guys who was on the road, into the space on the end of the road.

595
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:42,847
Scott: Now, if any road that is touching that guy, right?

596
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:47,130
Scott: You're gonna get points, pretty much, when people score it in that general area.

597
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:49,910
Scott: But, there are a few roads that are magic roads.

598
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:52,550
Scott: And if you score on those, you can score normally.

599
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:55,670
Scott: Or, you can upgrade your shit to be more efficient.

600
00:31:55,970 --> 00:32:11,810
Rym: So you have a little eclipse-style thing in front of you, meaning you've got a board where you put a bunch of cubes and discs on it, and to upgrade, when you do that action, you take a cube or disc off of the appropriate spot, put it into your bag, AKA your supply, and then your power is upgraded.

601
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:15,950
Rym: So you lift a cube off the Acciones, and now Daddy 3 Acciones.

602
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:19,090
Scott: So, the things you can upgrade is you can upgrade your Acciones.

603
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:21,270
Rym: We're gonna use our terms, not the game's terms.

604
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:23,350
Scott: Right, well, Acciones, I think, is also the game's term.

605
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:24,370
Rym: It's just actions.

606
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:25,730
Scott: Yeah, it's just more actions.

607
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:28,150
Scott: So, obviously, that's a basic thing to go for.

608
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,810
Scott: It's not a bad thing to go for at all.

609
00:32:29,911 --> 00:32:31,290
Rym: Yup, for example, take two actions.

610
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:32,630
Scott: It's generally just good to get more actions.

611
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:33,458
Rym: It's just on your turn.

612
00:32:33,539 --> 00:32:34,125
Rym: How many actions?

613
00:32:34,145 --> 00:32:34,590
Rym: I get five actions.

614
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:36,043
Scott: It's like having a baby in a gricola.

615
00:32:36,104 --> 00:32:36,790
Scott: It's pretty strong.

616
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:37,159
Rym: Yup.

617
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:38,372
Scott: The bag.

618
00:32:38,452 --> 00:32:43,750
Scott: So the bag is, one of the actions you can take is to get guys from the graveyard into the supply.

619
00:32:44,633 --> 00:32:45,010
Scott: Or the bag.

620
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:48,590
Scott: Yeah, you can only use guys who are not in the graveyard.

621
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:54,150
Scott: So being able to get more guys out of the graveyard with a single action basically saves you actions.

622
00:32:54,591 --> 00:33:00,350
Scott: So upgrading that is very similar to upgrading your Acciones in that it increases your efficiency of getting shit done.

623
00:33:00,751 --> 00:33:00,891
Rym: Yup.

624
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:04,030
Rym: There's the Lieber Sophia, or as we call them, Liebers.

625
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:04,442
Scott: Right.

626
00:33:04,631 --> 00:33:05,568
Rym: Or just disks.

627
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:07,170
Scott: So the Liebers is really powerful.

628
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,495
Scott: The Lieber is.

629
00:33:08,575 --> 00:33:11,930
Scott: one of the actions you can use is to helicopter guys around the board.

630
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:17,830
Scott: So it's sometimes you might be able to get guys onto the board for free, but they'll be in a bad place.

631
00:33:18,252 --> 00:33:21,270
Scott: So you can use the Lieber helicopter to move guys.

632
00:33:21,631 --> 00:33:25,184
Scott: The more you upgrade the Lieber, the more guys you can move with a single action.

633
00:33:25,565 --> 00:33:26,910
Scott: That's really frickin' strong.

634
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:30,290
Rym: And also upgrading it, remember the mechanic I said is Eclipse style.

635
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:35,790
Rym: You take the cube, or in this case the disk, off of that area and bring it into your bag.

636
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:37,389
Rym: So now you have more disks.

637
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:41,250
Scott: Right, so you start the game with one disk and there's four disks sitting on the board.

638
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:47,590
Scott: To get those four extra disks, well three extra disks, you need to upgrade the Lieber, which is upgrading the helicopter power.

639
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:50,209
Rym: There's the Pribiligum, as we like to call it.

640
00:33:50,491 --> 00:33:54,610
Scott: Right, so there are certain places on the board where you can't put a guy because they're upgraded colors.

641
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:57,881
Scott: And you need to upgrade your privilege to go into those spaces.

642
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,470
Rym: Yeah, mini, maxi, and maximum.

643
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:07,670
Scott: So there's a lot of spaces where no one can go and there won't be any competition for those spaces because people don't have Pribiligum.

644
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:12,030
Scott: So if you get Pribiligum, you can just go there uncontested and it's pretty frickin' strong.

645
00:34:12,692 --> 00:34:14,239
Scott: And the final upgrade is the key.

646
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,409
Scott: The key doesn't do anything to make you more efficient.

647
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:18,570
Rym: It's a score multiplier at the end of the game.

648
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:21,543
Scott: It multiplies one of the scoring aspects of the game.

649
00:34:21,623 --> 00:34:23,310
Scott: So it's the network aspect.

650
00:34:23,409 --> 00:34:28,170
Scott: So if you have a large network of dudes in houses on the board at the end of the game, you get a lot of points for that.

651
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:31,909
Scott: The key will multiply the number of points you get for that if you upgrade the key.

652
00:34:32,532 --> 00:34:34,670
Scott: So that can be really strong scoring-wise.

653
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:43,409
Scott: But if you don't have a big network or if the game is very short, not allowing anyone to build a big network, upgrading the key is pretty futile.

654
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:45,609
Rym: Yep, it doesn't do anything for you until the end.

655
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:46,150
Scott: Right.

656
00:34:46,351 --> 00:34:50,565
Scott: So usually the key gets rushed at the end, but it's really easy to get early.

657
00:34:50,585 --> 00:34:52,230
Scott: So maybe you just go for it early.

658
00:34:52,572 --> 00:34:52,757
Scott: No, never.

659
00:34:52,777 --> 00:34:52,880
Scott: Never.

660
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:55,690
Scott: But then if the game doesn't go long, you just wasted that shit.

661
00:34:56,110 --> 00:35:00,307
Scott: And if someone else goes for the key early, maybe try to rush the game so it ends quickly.

662
00:35:00,347 --> 00:35:01,250
Scott: so their key is useless.

663
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:05,050
Scott: Because if they went key early and the game goes long, they're just gonna win.

664
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:09,090
Rym: So to give you a sense of all these multiple paths to victory, you can farm a network.

665
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:14,030
Rym: So as you put guys in these towns, they're your largest contiguous branching network.

666
00:35:14,451 --> 00:35:15,896
Rym: So not a line like most games.

667
00:35:15,976 --> 00:35:17,842
Rym: They can get to everything else.

668
00:35:17,903 --> 00:35:20,070
Rym: The biggest branch you can possibly make.

669
00:35:20,211 --> 00:35:20,849
Scott: Blob, basically.

670
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:26,790
Rym: You just multiply the number of dudes you've got out there in that branch times the key value, which goes up to four.

671
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:27,878
Rym: Which can be tremendous.

672
00:35:27,898 --> 00:35:29,450
Scott: That alone will just win the game.

673
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:30,602
Rym: I've seen people get 20, 30 plus points.

674
00:35:31,431 --> 00:35:34,270
Scott: More points than any other scoring mechanism combined, right?

675
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:38,965
Rym: You also get points at the end of the game for every special disc you use.

676
00:35:38,985 --> 00:35:39,487
Rym: We'll talk about those.

677
00:35:39,527 --> 00:35:39,848
Rym: last.

678
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:40,270
Rym: The plates.

679
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:40,988
Scott: The plates.

680
00:35:41,311 --> 00:35:46,566
Rym: You also get points for every city that you control in terms of having a lot of guys in those cities.

681
00:35:46,606 --> 00:35:48,090
Rym: Like, you're controlling that one city.

682
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:51,385
Scott: Yeah, it's like, "Okay, I didn't make a network, but I just got control of a lot of

683
00:35:51,426 --> 00:35:51,807
Scott: spots.".

684
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:53,763
Scott: You know, so that's times two.

685
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:54,470
Scott: That's pretty strong.

686
00:35:54,630 --> 00:36:01,490
Rym: And there's the colon table where you can upgrade there and put a disc into it just to get a big fuck ton of victory points at the end.

687
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:02,928
Scott: It's pretty much just, "Get

688
00:36:02,948 --> 00:36:03,070
Scott: points."

689
00:36:03,731 --> 00:36:05,929
Scott: And usually that's the way to get a lot of points if you have...

690
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:07,870
Rym: Well, when Ro filled up three of those things.

691
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:11,750
Scott: Yeah, you need Privligum to get those colon points except for the lowest one.

692
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:14,218
Scott: And that adds up because it's like, what?

693
00:36:14,218 --> 00:36:16,006
Scott: 8, 9, 10, 11 or something like that?

694
00:36:16,046 --> 00:36:17,370
Scott: Or 9, 10, 11, 12?

695
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:19,193
Rym: The top one's 11.

696
00:36:19,193 --> 00:36:20,141
Scott: Right, so it's 8, 9, 10, 11.

697
00:36:20,141 --> 00:36:21,190
Scott: What's 8 plus 9 plus 9 plus 11?

698
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:22,336
Rym: It's not 8, 9, there's a bigger jump.

699
00:36:22,557 --> 00:36:23,220
Rym: I forget the numbers.

700
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,470
Rym: It's like 7, 8, 9, 11.

701
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:25,792
Rym: Whatever.

702
00:36:25,852 --> 00:36:28,930
Scott: It's a big frickin' score if you can get more than one in there.

703
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:31,985
Scott: So upgrading your Privligum and then getting colons is just a pile of points.

704
00:36:32,005 --> 00:36:33,030
Scott: you can ignore the rest of the game.

705
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:35,630
Rym: But you are giving up your discs to make that happen.

706
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:37,557
Scott: Yeah, you need to get Liebers also.

707
00:36:37,617 --> 00:36:41,110
Scott: So if you go all Lieber, all Privligum, then you can go colon and get those points.

708
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:46,624
Rym: Seriously, you might think we're being dumb for not using the terminology in the book.

709
00:36:46,865 --> 00:36:48,050
Rym: The book fucking sucks.

710
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:51,329
Rym: So the way you actually play... Oh, there's more points.

711
00:36:51,891 --> 00:36:57,413
Rym: If you control the city, anyone who scores that city from any road... Yeah, you get a point.

712
00:36:57,875 --> 00:37:01,110
Rym: There's some bonus points for scoring certain places and putting your dudes on them.

713
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,753
Scott: So scoring in a hot area early.

714
00:37:02,793 --> 00:37:12,050
Scott: So if I go to the city that's touching the Axiones road, and I put a dude in it early, anyone else who tries to upgrade their Axiones is gonna end up giving me a point when they do so.

715
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:14,230
Rym: Unless I immediately jump in there with my Privligum.

716
00:37:14,694 --> 00:37:14,929
Scott: Sure.

717
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:15,948
Rym: And get above you.

718
00:37:16,411 --> 00:37:18,129
Scott: But then you're not getting an Axione either.

719
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:18,672
Rym: Yup.

720
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,969
Rym: But you also get points...

721
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:22,489
Scott: And I get a point when you do that.

722
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:26,402
Rym: At the two ends of the map, there's two red flag cities.

723
00:37:27,064 --> 00:37:29,010
Rym: If you connect them with dudes...

724
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:30,750
Scott: Which happens more often than you think it would.

725
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:32,196
Rym: You get a pile of points.

726
00:37:32,497 --> 00:37:35,870
Rym: And all the second set of points we talked about, you get during the game.

727
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:36,605
Rym: Yup.

728
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:38,679
Rym: The rest of the points are at the end, and that's key.

729
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:44,589
Rym: Because the way the games end are... One, if ten of the cities on the board get full of dudes...

730
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:46,529
Scott: Never happened in any game I've played ever.

731
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:51,710
Rym: Two, if the... There's a better order to do this in.

732
00:37:51,931 --> 00:37:52,549
Rym: The plates run out?

733
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:52,870
Rym: Yup.

734
00:37:53,011 --> 00:37:59,809
Rym: If the special plates that we haven't talked about yet are all taken, and there's some nuance around that, but it's pretty straightforward if you read the rules closely.

735
00:38:00,665 --> 00:38:00,829
Rym: Yup.

736
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:04,646
Rym: Or three, if anyone gets to 20 points.

737
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:09,240
Scott: Now the scoring track goes all the way around the board to 100, which makes you think, "Aha!

738
00:38:09,741 --> 00:38:12,649
Scott: The end of game scoring is really most of the

739
00:38:12,689 --> 00:38:12,950
Scott: points.".

740
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:13,878
Scott: And you know what?

741
00:38:13,898 --> 00:38:15,069
Scott: In a lot of games, it is.

742
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:25,470
Scott: But because that end of game score is so low, just 20, it's possible to rush it, preventing anyone from having a large end of game scoring.

743
00:38:26,531 --> 00:38:32,090
Scott: Scores overall will be low, and those 20 points that you got really quickly might just be enough to end the game.

744
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:35,370
Rym: So there's another reason this game is so interactive.

745
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:38,250
Rym: The actions you can take, the actual things you do with your Acciones.

746
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:45,670
Rym: Now again, on your cheat sheet at Clipsboard, there are five little reminders as to what the actions do.

747
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:49,525
Rym: They are worse than bullshit.

748
00:38:49,565 --> 00:38:50,590
Rym: They will confuse you.

749
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:52,989
Rym: I would recommend cutting them off of your game.

750
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:56,510
Rym: I would actually recommend blacking them out, putting stickers over them.

751
00:38:57,311 --> 00:39:00,989
Rym: Anyone new who tries to look at those things just gets confused as to what they mean.

752
00:39:01,651 --> 00:39:03,070
Rym: They're literally worthless.

753
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:05,310
Rym: But you can pull guys out of your bag.

754
00:39:05,771 --> 00:39:06,809
Rym: You can put guys on the board.

755
00:39:07,312 --> 00:39:09,210
Rym: You can move guys around with your Libra helicopter.

756
00:39:09,832 --> 00:39:11,090
Rym: You can score something.

757
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:13,109
Rym: Scoring takes an action.

758
00:39:14,411 --> 00:39:20,890
Rym: Or, and here's where the game gets doubly interactive, you can displace someone from a spot they're already on on the road.

759
00:39:21,011 --> 00:39:23,390
Scott: So let's say there's a road to upgrade Acciones, right?

760
00:39:23,831 --> 00:39:25,987
Scott: And I put two guys on it.

761
00:39:26,108 --> 00:39:26,390
Scott: One, two.

762
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:30,250
Scott: Then Rym goes and he puts a guy in the third spot and that's the whole road.

763
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:35,370
Scott: Well, in order to score the road, I have to have the road have three guys on it that are all mine.

764
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:39,910
Scott: So either, A, I leave those guys there forever, pointlessly.

765
00:39:40,772 --> 00:39:42,889
Scott: B, I helicopter them away to a different road.

766
00:39:43,331 --> 00:39:47,709
Scott: Or C, I bump Rym off that road, taking control of it and allowing myself to score it.

767
00:39:48,231 --> 00:39:58,010
Scott: But if I bump Rym off, I have to spend not only one guy to put a guy there in place of Rym's guy, but another guy has to go into the graveyard who had to fight Rym.

768
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:05,610
Rym: And then I get to take the guy he bumped and put him on an adjacent road, and I can take a guy from my graveyard and put him on the board.

769
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:11,530
Scott: So he basically gets a free action of putting a guy onto the board, and a free action of getting the guy out of the graveyard.

770
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:14,049
Scott: So it super helps someone when you bump them off.

771
00:40:14,271 --> 00:40:17,220
Rym: So getting bumped is a really reactionary thing.

772
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,210
Rym: People are trying to get bumped sometimes, but sometimes they don't want to get bumped.

773
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:26,328
Scott: Right, well it's like if you upgrade your bag, allowing you to get guys out of your graveyard really efficiently, then you want to be a bumper, right?

774
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:29,830
Scott: Because it's so easy for you to bump people off, you have tons of extra guys.

775
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:32,870
Rym: But if you keep bumping people, you obviate their need to ever bag.

776
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:37,790
Scott: Right, if you're getting bumped a lot, you can just upgrade your lever and helicopter, right?

777
00:40:38,051 --> 00:40:43,570
Scott: And then when someone bumps you, it's like, okay, I have to move my- I get extra guys on the board, but they're in a shitty location.

778
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:46,410
Scott: But that's fine, because I'll just helicopter them into place really efficiently.

779
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:48,789
Rym: So the lever discs, the merchants, I guess?

780
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:51,289
Scott: To bump them, you gotta bump two daddies.

781
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:56,650
Rym: Two guys going to the graveyard, and then the guy you bumped gets two extra guys out of his graveyard.

782
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:57,915
Scott: That's why lever is so strong.

783
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:01,630
Scott: Just upgrade lever, put discs out, and then get people to bump your discs off.

784
00:41:01,951 --> 00:41:04,910
Scott: And you'll get all these free guys on the board without having to upgrade your bag.

785
00:41:05,271 --> 00:41:10,170
Scott: And then because you upgraded lever already, you can helicopter them into the good position really quickly.

786
00:41:10,572 --> 00:41:13,830
Rym: So with all of this, there's also special plates.

787
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:17,210
Rym: And you're gonna fuck those rules up like three or four times before you get it right.

788
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:20,049
Scott: There's always supposed to be three on the board unless the game is over.

789
00:41:20,431 --> 00:41:25,630
Scott: So many games we've played with all smart people, we ended up with two on the board, one on the board, five on the board.

790
00:41:26,052 --> 00:41:27,220
Scott: How the fuck did that happen?

791
00:41:27,784 --> 00:41:28,609
Scott: We all fucked it up.

792
00:41:29,332 --> 00:41:34,127
Rym: So at the end of every turn, our meme we always say is, "Is plate integrity

793
00:41:34,188 --> 00:41:34,769
Rym: maintained?".

794
00:41:35,772 --> 00:41:39,250
Rym: And then everyone has to agree that it is before we continue to the next turn.

795
00:41:40,491 --> 00:41:43,570
Rym: The plates, if you score a row that has a plate pointed at it, you get the plate.

796
00:41:44,111 --> 00:41:46,530
Rym: And then you can take a new plate to put somewhere on the board.

797
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:49,468
Rym: The plates have powers like, "Remove three dudes from the

798
00:41:49,508 --> 00:41:49,710
Rym: board."

799
00:41:49,871 --> 00:41:51,927
Rym: Or, "Hey guys, four extra actions right

800
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:52,189
Rym: now.".

801
00:41:52,491 --> 00:41:56,770
Scott: Some of the plates are just obviously more strong, like the four or five extra actions at once.

802
00:41:57,492 --> 00:41:58,877
Rym: I find those to be weaker.

803
00:41:58,978 --> 00:42:02,410
Rym: I like the swap-a-dude, and I like the remove three dudes.

804
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:08,170
Scott: The swap one can be very strong in the right situation, but in other situations it can be worthless.

805
00:42:08,971 --> 00:42:12,490
Scott: The remove three dudes is ridiculously strong in just about any situation.

806
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:15,350
Scott: Especially if your bag is not upgraded very well.

807
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:17,039
Rym: The plates are also worth points.

808
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,010
Rym: The more you get, the more points each one is worth.

809
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:25,350
Scott: So you can just play for the plates, and then using the plates also helps you get more plates and more other things also.

810
00:42:25,611 --> 00:42:29,970
Rym: I've seen people win this game ignoring everything and just trying to get every plate as fast as possible.

811
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:31,896
Scott: Yeah, and that ends the game as well.

812
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:35,850
Scott: So even if no one gets to 20 points, if you get enough plates, you can end the game pretty quickly.

813
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:53,250
Rym: This is a game, primarily, if you want to talk about the skills involved, of predicting what other players' strategies are, and coming up with the best counter to them, while simultaneously obfuscating what you're doing, or putting yourself into such a position of strength that people can't stop you.

814
00:42:53,451 --> 00:42:57,870
Scott: It's not a game where I can tell you, like settlers, just do one of these two things every game.

815
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:09,330
Scott: It's like, alright, you have to really assess what's going on in the whole lay of the land every turn, see what everyone's doing, and there will be a different path to go every different game based on what people have done.

816
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:11,870
Rym: Yup, and your path might change mid-game.

817
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:14,950
Scott: You also just might be fucked based on where you're sitting or something.

818
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:15,351
Rym: Yup.

819
00:43:15,792 --> 00:43:20,970
Rym: A pretty powerful strategy I've found is to focus on a few things.

820
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:22,750
Rym: Like, upgrade your actions a little bit.

821
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:25,670
Scott: Yeah, just focus on something basic early on until you see the lay of the land.

822
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:34,430
Rym: Yup, and wait and see, and hope that people move the game in a certain direction that you can then react to and capitalize on the fact that you were waiting for them to move.

823
00:43:35,753 --> 00:43:37,366
Scott: The theme of the game has something to do with...

824
00:43:38,154 --> 00:43:39,430
Rym: The Hanseatic League?

825
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:41,381
Scott: Yeah, and it doesn't exist.

826
00:43:41,421 --> 00:43:42,770
Scott: We can't figure out what the fuck is going on.

827
00:43:43,111 --> 00:43:45,269
Rym: Yeah, ignore all the theming of the game.

828
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:47,310
Scott: Trading, some shit, whatever, who cares.

829
00:43:47,511 --> 00:43:53,910
Rym: That's why games like Puerto Rico or Tigger's New Freighties to this day hold this extra tier for us.

830
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:57,770
Rym: Because one, they're extremely complex, well thought out mechanically as games.

831
00:43:58,190 --> 00:44:07,009
Rym: But two, the theme is integrally woven into the games in such a wonderful and nuanced way that a lot of more modern games just don't do.

832
00:44:07,931 --> 00:44:09,470
Rym: This game has terrible iconography.

833
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:17,450
Rym: It's extremely confusing without a very specific and detailed explanation of how to upgrade everything and how everything works.

834
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:20,270
Scott: From someone who read the rules 20 times on the internet.

835
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:23,290
Rym: But otherwise, it's a really solid game.

836
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:24,790
Rym: I'm really surprised it held up.

837
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:30,068
Rym: I mean, Thurn in Texas, which we loved, didn't make it through four playthroughs before we figured it out and we were done with it.

838
00:44:30,671 --> 00:44:33,790
Rym: This game, I think, will have a decent bit of staying power.

839
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:36,250
Scott: Thurn in Texas is a lot like Ticket to Ride, basically.

840
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:43,650
Rym: Yeah, this is more like those older German board games with cubes in a lot of ways.

841
00:44:44,933 --> 00:44:46,610
Rym: I'll point out, we're talking about strategy.

842
00:44:47,291 --> 00:44:52,670
Rym: If you upgrade your actions or your bag once, you get an immediate bonus.

843
00:44:53,792 --> 00:44:57,310
Rym: If you upgrade your actions a second time, you don't get a bonus.

844
00:44:57,450 --> 00:44:58,848
Rym: You have to upgrade it a third time.

845
00:44:59,391 --> 00:45:02,710
Rym: So it's usually not worth it to try to blitz actions hard.

846
00:45:02,810 --> 00:45:06,670
Rym: Your best bet is to blitz actions as fast as possible just to get to three actions.

847
00:45:07,152 --> 00:45:09,430
Rym: And then you don't need that fourth action immediately.

848
00:45:09,531 --> 00:45:11,230
Rym: You can do that opportunistically if you're clever.

849
00:45:11,330 --> 00:45:14,624
Scott: Yeah, it's like if there's an opportunity to just be like, "Helicopter

850
00:45:14,664 --> 00:45:15,146
Scott: score!"

851
00:45:15,307 --> 00:45:18,670
Scott: with two actions to get that action when it's upgraded, I would go for it.

852
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:26,050
Rym: Yeah, but don't spend three turns orchestrating your four actions early game that you get much more bang for your buck getting that third action and then going somewhere else.

853
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:31,030
Scott: Or getting one bag upgrade, which is probably easier to get and is also going to save you actions.

854
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:38,169
Rym: Yup, if all the other players are just having this deathmatch with discs everywhere around the actions, go upgrade your key and your privilium a whole bunch.

855
00:45:38,558 --> 00:45:38,685
Scott: Yeah.

856
00:45:39,274 --> 00:45:41,069
Rym: Or just start taking cities in the middle.

857
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:41,790
Scott: Yup.

858
00:45:42,532 --> 00:45:44,230
Rym: People forget they can take cities in this game sometimes.

859
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:44,853
Scott: That's another thing.

860
00:45:44,893 --> 00:45:50,029
Scott: is that usually in a game, there's like a hot spot where all the valuable shit is and people fight over that.

861
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:53,050
Scott: In this game, there's valuable shit all over the place.

862
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:55,270
Scott: There's not like areas of the board that are dead.

863
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:56,430
Scott: Why would you ever go there?

864
00:45:56,951 --> 00:45:58,690
Scott: It's like, no, the whole board is hot.

865
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:00,490
Scott: There'll be a plate over there that's looking hot.

866
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:02,630
Scott: There'll be a nice city you can get over there.

867
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:04,189
Scott: Easy connection, right?

868
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:05,410
Scott: You can go for the colon.

869
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:07,850
Scott: If no one's going for the colon, it's like that's worth a ton of points.

870
00:46:07,912 --> 00:46:08,509
Scott: It's pretty hot.

871
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:10,010
Rym: If you just sneak in there once.

872
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:11,670
Scott: Oh, everyone's going for all those other hot things.

873
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:12,863
Scott: I'll just take Sanacione, right?

874
00:46:13,851 --> 00:46:15,170
Scott: It's just hot stuff everywhere.

875
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:22,908
Scott: And you'll see, once people, if you play with people who've played a lot, there'll be cubes all over the place, not just in like one area.

876
00:46:22,968 --> 00:46:23,370
Scott: that's awesome.

877
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:28,690
Rym: Now, the game takes two to five players, but there are three variants to accomplish that.

878
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:31,710
Rym: Two player has this thing where there's these knights that move around.

879
00:46:31,731 --> 00:46:32,510
Rym: I haven't played it.

880
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:33,210
Rym: We haven't either.

881
00:46:33,350 --> 00:46:34,430
Rym: People say it's not that great.

882
00:46:34,574 --> 00:46:34,744
Rym: Okay.

883
00:46:36,852 --> 00:46:39,350
Rym: Two and three player use one side of the board.

884
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:41,681
Rym: Four and five player use another side of the board.

885
00:46:41,701 --> 00:46:43,350
Rym: that has just more connections between cities.

886
00:46:44,590 --> 00:46:48,090
Rym: I think the game is best with three or five players.

887
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:51,830
Rym: Board Game Geek says the game is best with five players.

888
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:56,710
Rym: But three and five are very different, kind of like the difference between three and five and Puerto Rico.

889
00:46:57,353 --> 00:46:59,189
Rym: Very different strategies, very different game.

890
00:47:00,232 --> 00:47:03,569
Rym: I worry that with four players, the board's a little too open.

891
00:47:03,939 --> 00:47:04,230
Scott: Yeah.

892
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:09,990
Rym: But I think four players doesn't work on the smaller one, so I think you should try to avoid playing with four people.

893
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:11,689
Rym: Go for three or five.

894
00:47:14,591 --> 00:47:15,780
Rym: So, I don't know what else I can say.

895
00:47:15,821 --> 00:47:16,930
Rym: I mean, you guys should play this game.

896
00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:19,270
Scott: If you're playing board games, play this one.

897
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:28,550
Rym: So, Andreas Steding, it's interesting, because I actually didn't know who he was, and he doesn't seem to have a lot of games, at least that are known in the US, to his name.

898
00:47:29,212 --> 00:47:31,050
Rym: Like Scottish Highland Whiskey Race.

899
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:32,409
Scott: That's amazing.

900
00:47:32,739 --> 00:47:32,867
Scott: Yeah.

901
00:47:33,051 --> 00:47:34,127
Scott: I don't care what that game is.

902
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:36,908
Rym: Hispania is the only one that I've heard of.

903
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:39,590
Rym: I mean, Italia, I've seen but I've never played.

904
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:41,730
Rym: Heart of Africa, I've seen but I've never played.

905
00:47:42,471 --> 00:47:45,350
Rym: Oh, the Hansa Zutana expansion, I need that.

906
00:47:45,735 --> 00:47:45,910
Scott: Alright.

907
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:46,729
Rym: God damn it.

908
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:47,749
Scott: Who knows what's in that thing.

909
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:49,689
Rym: Yeah, I kind of really want it now.

910
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:50,269
Scott: Okay.

911
00:47:50,891 --> 00:47:54,731
Rym: And it doesn't look like he's published anything since 2010.

912
00:47:54,731 --> 00:47:54,933
Scott: Huh.

913
00:47:55,438 --> 00:47:56,730
Scott: Maybe he's working on a masterpiece.
