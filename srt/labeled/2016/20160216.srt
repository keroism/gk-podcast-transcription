1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,220
Rym: It's Tuesday, February 16th, 2016.

2
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,129
Rym: I'm Rym, and this is GeekNights Tonight.

3
00:00:18,735 --> 00:00:19,241
Scott: Helldivers.

4
00:00:19,301 --> 00:00:19,889
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:27,880
Rym: So we mentioned a bunch of times that we've been playing a giant multiplayer robot game of Civ 5.

6
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,699
Rym: We're what, like 70 turns in now?

7
00:00:30,021 --> 00:00:32,400
Scott: I don't know how many turns it is, but I need some fucking money.

8
00:00:34,646 --> 00:00:37,219
Scott: My caravan was doing great, and then a barbarian just went

9
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:37,320
Scott: "boop!".

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,444
Rym: You gotta protect that shit.

11
00:00:38,464 --> 00:00:41,618
Rym: You've got caravans going off into unprotected barbarian lands.

12
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,008
Scott: It was not unprotected barbarian lands.

13
00:00:44,089 --> 00:00:47,691
Scott: It was lands that I presumed were perfectly safe, and then a barbarian just went

14
00:00:47,711 --> 00:00:47,893
Scott: "whoop!".

15
00:00:48,075 --> 00:00:48,479
Rym: Here I am.

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,700
Rym: I got scouts patrolling my trade routes to make sure barbarians don't get out of there.

17
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,499
Scott: I don't have enough shit for that.

18
00:00:54,781 --> 00:00:58,260
Scott: Also, I don't necessarily trust- Because there's so many fucking barbarians in the way.

19
00:00:59,022 --> 00:01:03,240
Scott: All my guys were on the barbarians behind my territory, but my caravan went in the other direction.

20
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,540
Rym: Well, that's your problem.

21
00:01:04,801 --> 00:01:08,279
Scott: But the city that I was sending it to was right there.

22
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,340
Rym: Send it to a different city!

23
00:01:10,181 --> 00:01:13,100
Scott: There was no other city to send it to because there's no one fucking near me.

24
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,460
Rym: Then send it to your own city and you get a huge boost instead of money.

25
00:01:16,821 --> 00:01:16,981
Scott: It was.

26
00:01:17,021 --> 00:01:21,800
Scott: I needed more monies than that to make up for my debts because I built so many good buildings at high maintenance.

27
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:22,691
Rym: I thought you built too much shit.

28
00:01:22,711 --> 00:01:23,298
Rym: You know what you should do?

29
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,339
Scott: But I had good shit!

30
00:01:25,101 --> 00:01:25,763
Rym: Good shit!

31
00:01:26,024 --> 00:01:30,540
Rym: If you can send a guy near me, I will gladly pay you money for a luxury resource.

32
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,070
Scott: I'm on a worthless island.

33
00:01:32,171 --> 00:01:33,379
Scott: Am I gonna send a guy to you?

34
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,459
Rym: Completely on an island?

35
00:01:37,685 --> 00:01:39,180
Rym: Is there shallows they get across?

36
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:42,676
Rym: Is your science so pathetic that you can't go into the shallows yet?

37
00:01:42,716 --> 00:01:43,260
Rym: Can you embark?

38
00:01:44,602 --> 00:01:48,360
Scott: I would need to build something.

39
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:48,966
Rym: Just a scout!

40
00:01:48,987 --> 00:01:49,799
Rym: Just send a scout down.

41
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:55,620
Scott: Meanwhile, by the time I build the thing, you know, what's gonna happen to my monies?

42
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,419
Scott: My coffers are gonna be empty.

43
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,159
Rym: Well, don't you trade with Lisa.

44
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,700
Scott: She's on the other side of the barbarians.

45
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,160
Rym: Do you have diplomatic relations?

46
00:02:05,842 --> 00:02:06,478
Scott: Uh, no.

47
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,900
Rym: You never bumped into her so you can see her in the diplomatic thing?

48
00:02:10,401 --> 00:02:13,000
Scott: Uh, maybe I can, but she's not gonna just give me fucking money.

49
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,184
Rym: Well, trade her something.

50
00:02:14,225 --> 00:02:15,690
Rym: That's how diplomacy works.

51
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:17,197
Rym: Like, "Yo, I'll give you this

52
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:17,357
Rym: city.".

53
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,718
Scott: I'm gonna trade with someone who's like right there.

54
00:02:20,244 --> 00:02:20,638
Rym: Why not?

55
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,951
Scott: Who's like the most powerful person in the game?

56
00:02:22,992 --> 00:02:24,340
Scott: and I'm like the last most powerful.

57
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,440
Rym: If you're the last most powerful, you should ally with the first most powerful for a little while to suck resources out of her.

58
00:02:30,343 --> 00:02:31,059
Scott: Why would she do that?

59
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,608
Rym: 'Cause she'll treat you like a toady.

60
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,740
Rym: Or she'll give you, she's probably gonna, you know what, also.

61
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,570
Scott: Then how come, how does she have money?

62
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,274
Scott: That's not interesting.

63
00:02:37,294 --> 00:02:38,140
Scott: You're in the same situation.

64
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,980
Rym: I got a shit ton of money.

65
00:02:40,101 --> 00:02:41,159
Scott: How did you get all the money from?

66
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:44,359
Rym: I got spices all over, up ends.

67
00:02:44,561 --> 00:02:46,080
Scott: How did you get, how did you turn them into money?

68
00:02:46,761 --> 00:02:49,394
Rym: Uh, spices, if you work them, give you like three gold.

69
00:02:49,554 --> 00:02:50,680
Rym: Just on the land.

70
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:55,080
Scott: Yeah, I have some spaces like that, but it still doesn't add up to as much money as it costs me every turn.

71
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,379
Scott: How many militaries do you have?

72
00:02:57,003 --> 00:02:57,995
Rym: Uh, pretty large military, actually.

73
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,819
Scott: Yeah, I had to disband a military 'cause I couldn't afford it.

74
00:03:01,021 --> 00:03:06,120
Rym: I may have a trade agreement where I'm giving someone a luxury resource in return for like seven gold a turn.

75
00:03:06,884 --> 00:03:07,920
Scott: Oh, well that matters a lot.

76
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:08,938
Rym: Yeah, so.

77
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,180
Scott: But I'm not near anyone to make a trade agreement.

78
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,480
Rym: In fact, I'm gonna build my fourth city real soon, I think.

79
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,670
Scott: I don't even have a third city 'cause I can't make a settler.

80
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,700
Scott: 'cause I'm too busy trying to build a replacement caravan.

81
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,600
Rym: Uh, sounds like civilization, tell you what, Scott, if you reach me and make diplomatic relations.

82
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:28,240
Scott: I wanna see like exactly what you had each city building each turn that allowed you to be more productive.

83
00:03:28,561 --> 00:03:33,580
Rym: I'll tell you what, one thing that I did different, probably, is that I placed my cities real well.

84
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,879
Scott: I placed my cities real well.

85
00:03:36,321 --> 00:03:39,100
Rym: And I rushed culture so I could max out liberty.

86
00:03:40,382 --> 00:03:42,320
Scott: I mean, I got as much culture as I could.

87
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,331
Rym: Yeah, you traditioned.

88
00:03:45,003 --> 00:03:45,680
Rym: Tradition sucks.

89
00:03:47,588 --> 00:03:47,778
Scott: Alright.

90
00:03:48,183 --> 00:03:48,740
Rym: That's part of it.

91
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,279
Rym: What did you get?

92
00:03:49,924 --> 00:03:50,660
Rym: Liberty, all liberty.

93
00:03:51,283 --> 00:03:52,140
Scott: I also got liberty.

94
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,500
Rym: In fact, I'm almost done with liberty.

95
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:55,319
Scott: I only have like one liberty.

96
00:03:55,582 --> 00:03:55,804
Rym: What?

97
00:03:55,884 --> 00:03:57,860
Rym: Did you build like monuments or amphitheaters?

98
00:03:58,801 --> 00:04:02,080
Scott: I built, I can't build an amphitheater yet, I built monuments.

99
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,700
Rym: In every city as soon as you started the city?

100
00:04:05,525 --> 00:04:05,937
Scott: Uh, yeah.

101
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:06,689
Rym: Alright.

102
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,680
Rym: So you built a monument, every city you founded, the first thing you built was a monument.

103
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,458
Scott: Yes, all two of them.

104
00:04:12,302 --> 00:04:13,800
Rym: And you built a monument both immediately.

105
00:04:14,181 --> 00:04:14,266
Scott: Yeah.

106
00:04:16,063 --> 00:04:20,860
Rym: And, well liberty gives you, makes monuments give you more liberty, or give you more culture among other things.

107
00:04:21,841 --> 00:04:25,100
Scott: Well, I mean, I spent all my time fighting barbaros.

108
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,519
Scott: How many barbaros did you have to fight?

109
00:04:27,122 --> 00:04:29,279
Rym: Uh, I've destroyed like nine encampments.

110
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,300
Scott: I've only seen like three encampments.

111
00:04:31,421 --> 00:04:32,860
Scott: If I could, I actually have a military now.

112
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,480
Scott: If another encampment appeared, I could kill it and get money.

113
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,400
Rym: Yeah, encampments keep spawning because there's this, me and Alex have this truce.

114
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,440
Rym: So there's an area between us where there's no settlements.

115
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,920
Scott: There is no encampments spawning.

116
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,420
Rym: And the problem is fucking barbarians keep spawning in this area.

117
00:04:44,681 --> 00:04:47,680
Scott: I kill, I invested in this military to kill barbarians.

118
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,960
Scott: I killed them all and no new ones are showing up except for the one that popped out of nowhere to kill my caravan.

119
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,060
Rym: So take over like a city-state or the rest of the area.

120
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:54,617
Rym: Just conquer it?

121
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,879
Rym: Yeah, just fucking go.

122
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,760
Scott: But that's gonna hurt me if I conquer it.

123
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,080
Scott: It's gonna bring me all kinds of unhappiness and troubles.

124
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,578
Rym: Not that much.

125
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:04,520
Rym: Plus, puppeted cities give you their science and their production and everything.

126
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,300
Scott: Aren't they gonna cost me a whole bunch?

127
00:05:06,861 --> 00:05:09,199
Scott: Every time I conquer something when I play Civ, it just hurts me.

128
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:12,660
Rym: It's always good for you unless you really overstep yourself.

129
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,357
Scott: Every time in the history of Civ I've conquered something, it's been like, "Oh, you conquered

130
00:05:15,377 --> 00:05:15,659
Scott: something.".

131
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:22,140
Scott: Alright, yeah, now there's a bunch of people who hate you and your happiness is negative ten and it costs you a million dollars to maintain their shit and they suck.

132
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,300
Rym: Yeah, and that goes down rapidly and then after a few turns it's making money again.

133
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,459
Scott: I've never had that happen.

134
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,760
Rym: Also, puppet them and they don't increase the cost of the next social policy.

135
00:05:32,983 --> 00:05:33,840
Scott: Never had this happen.

136
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:38,980
Rym: The social policies only get more expensive if you found or take cities and make them legit cities.

137
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,956
Scott: Maybe I'll just give all my stuff to Lisa so she wins and be a troll.

138
00:05:42,117 --> 00:05:42,640
Scott: if I can't win.

139
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,476
Rym: Why don't you give it to me?

140
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,074
Scott: Because you're on the other side of the map.

141
00:05:45,155 --> 00:05:45,459
Scott: Fuck you.

142
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,498
Rym: Why don't you give it to Scott Johnson?

143
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,399
Scott: Also, if it's a vote who wins game, I'm not voting for you.

144
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:49,448
Rym: Why not vote for me?

145
00:05:49,468 --> 00:05:50,500
Rym: Because right now Lisa's winning.

146
00:05:51,141 --> 00:05:51,544
Scott: Uh, okay.

147
00:05:52,008 --> 00:05:52,371
Scott: She can win.

148
00:05:52,391 --> 00:05:53,460
Scott: It'll be done even faster.

149
00:05:54,741 --> 00:05:56,286
Rym: The thing is, you being done doesn't matter.

150
00:05:56,306 --> 00:06:00,240
Rym: Why don't you just give each of your cities to a different person?

151
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,480
Scott: My lands are real valuable.

152
00:06:01,801 --> 00:06:02,278
Rym: No, they're not.

153
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:02,879
Scott: They are.

154
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:04,240
Rym: Apparently they don't make any money.

155
00:06:05,101 --> 00:06:06,928
Scott: I have mad sugars and shit.

156
00:06:06,948 --> 00:06:08,935
Scott: It just doesn't make enough money for some reason.

157
00:06:08,955 --> 00:06:10,480
Scott: I don't know where you got those extra monies from.

158
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,520
Rym: So, Scott, how many buildings are in your capital?

159
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:13,767
Scott: Buildings?

160
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:14,419
Scott: I don't even know.

161
00:06:15,483 --> 00:06:15,866
Rym: Oh, okay.

162
00:06:15,887 --> 00:06:17,499
Rym: Because I have like two buildings.

163
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,039
Scott: I have way more than two buildings.

164
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,380
Rym: Yeah, buildings cost a lot of money to maintain.

165
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,799
Scott: I got a library and all kinds of good stuff.

166
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:30,460
Scott: I had to get rid of my, I built a religious building just to get the pantheon, but then I had to sell it off to get the monies back, you know.

167
00:06:30,881 --> 00:06:32,088
Rym: Ah, I've never sold a building.

168
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:33,919
Rym: Selling a building is like, you've already lost.

169
00:06:34,784 --> 00:06:35,519
Scott: I had no monies.

170
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,649
Rym: How'd you run out of money?

171
00:06:37,175 --> 00:06:37,479
Scott: Did you?

172
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:43,660
Scott: Because I had a caravan to keep my coffers in the plus, and then the caravan got killed and it became minus.

173
00:06:44,042 --> 00:06:44,886
Rym: How much minus?

174
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:47,960
Rym: It still used to have like 80 or 90 gold back up just hanging out.

175
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:54,500
Scott: I killed a barbarian camp and that gave me enough money, but then after five turns that money was gone because it was negative every single turn.

176
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,480
Rym: Alright, did you build- It was like negative five.

177
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,514
Rym: Did you build a whole bunch of like roads and improvements and shit everywhere?

178
00:07:00,534 --> 00:07:02,280
Rym: Because each one of those costs a gold to maintain.

179
00:07:02,681 --> 00:07:03,820
Scott: Yeah, I have a whole bunch of them.

180
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,279
Rym: Do you have more than you're using?

181
00:07:06,202 --> 00:07:06,506
Scott: Uh, no.

182
00:07:06,546 --> 00:07:07,640
Scott: I'm using every single one.

183
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,620
Rym: You're literally using every one of those improvements.

184
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,011
Scott: Yup.

185
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,044
Rym: Uh-huh.

186
00:07:11,901 --> 00:07:13,003
Scott: Like a mad population.

187
00:07:13,043 --> 00:07:13,845
Scott: I'm using every improvement.

188
00:07:13,865 --> 00:07:19,880
Scott: In fact, I'm building an improvement so I can use it because I've got more alive populations on unimproved hexes.

189
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,320
Rym: Uh, did you rejigger your cities to produce gold instead of production?

190
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:32,419
Rym: Yes, they've been producing maximum gold since they've been, you know- I, if you log into your game and let me look at your cities, I will consult for you.

191
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,113
Scott: I mean, I'm going to quit the game anyways.

192
00:07:35,133 --> 00:07:35,800
Scott: It probably doesn't matter.

193
00:07:36,803 --> 00:07:38,006
Rym: I can show you what you did right now.

194
00:07:38,046 --> 00:07:38,969
Rym: I'll show you my cities.

195
00:07:38,989 --> 00:07:42,960
Rym: Except I don't want to show you where my military is because I might be doing something with it soon.

196
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,640
Scott: You're going to attack me across the water?

197
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,360
Rym: No, I'm not attacking you, but I still like keep my secrets close.

198
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,657
Rym: Someone's fucked in the nearing like 10 or 20 turns.

199
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,473
Scott: Well, people near Rym.

200
00:07:53,534 --> 00:07:53,980
Scott: Go watch out.

201
00:07:53,980 --> 00:08:02,200
Rym: So anyway, in the news, Street Fighter 5 came out and it's shocking how little I cared after I realized that it was out.

202
00:08:02,461 --> 00:08:03,164
Scott: Well, I mean, I saw it.

203
00:08:03,184 --> 00:08:05,894
Scott: It packs a few times and I'm like, oh, it's more Street Fighter.

204
00:08:05,935 --> 00:08:07,260
Scott: I play Street Fighter 4 a bunch.

205
00:08:07,661 --> 00:08:10,000
Scott: That'll hold me over to like Street Fighter 6 or something.

206
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:13,900
Scott: Yeah, I guess I just- Seven, maybe seven will be a probably exciting one.

207
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,267
Rym: I enjoy fighting games.

208
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:17,720
Rym: I even have like a Mad Catz, like awesome fighting stick.

209
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:20,870
Rym: I just, I don't have time for that anymore in my old age.

210
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:23,680
Rym: Like I don't play Street Fighter-ish games enough to be good at them.

211
00:08:24,321 --> 00:08:28,651
Rym: And the only fighting games I'm good at that exist still are like Soul Calibur style.

212
00:08:28,992 --> 00:08:38,515
Scott: So- I don't want to play those other high skill cap games.

213
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:43,659
Scott: We want to play low skill cap RTSs in fighting games and high skill cap RTSs in fighting games.

214
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:51,480
Rym: Which is interesting because remember most people who are very good at very high skill cap games specialize in those games and do not play many other games.

215
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,945
Rym: Which is true for us too in that realm.

216
00:08:54,426 --> 00:09:05,380
Rym: But it's like in Omegathon, if there was both an RTS and DDR in the same Omegathon, the Venn diagram of people who are very skilled at both is probably close to zero.

217
00:09:06,288 --> 00:09:06,699
Scott: Yeah, probably.

218
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,633
Rym: But there's a problem with Street Fighter 5 and it seems weird.

219
00:09:11,673 --> 00:09:13,640
Rym: I didn't dig into this too deeply.

220
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,105
Scott: Yeah, this sounds suspicious.

221
00:09:15,146 --> 00:09:16,210
Scott: I think it's overblown.

222
00:09:16,311 --> 00:09:18,440
Scott: Whatever you're saying is probably inaccurate in many ways.

223
00:09:18,961 --> 00:09:19,443
Rym: Not really.

224
00:09:19,784 --> 00:09:23,254
Rym: Because we ran into this and we complained about it in a previous Tuesday show.

225
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:31,220
Rym: Where we were at a party and there were two PS4s in two different rooms at the party and a bunch of controllers.

226
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:39,399
Rym: And every time we wanted to play like Towerfall or something, you had to fucking sit there and log every controller in as a guest one by one.

227
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:47,825
Rym: And if someone was logged in with a game and they played the game and then they started playing a game on a different PS4, it would just kick the game out and crash it.

228
00:09:48,427 --> 00:09:54,080
Rym: All these weird problems because it sort of assumes that everyone just has their own controller all the time forever.

229
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:59,840
Rym: And I guess brings the controller with them and always has an account and logs in even for local throwaway multiplayer.

230
00:10:00,301 --> 00:10:05,860
Rym: But, all that aside, that was a problem that existed, we were annoyed by, but it wasn't a deal breaker.

231
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,101
Rym: That seems to be what's causing the first of the controller problems with Street Fighter 5.

232
00:10:11,101 --> 00:10:16,339
Rym: Because apparently you need a modern controller or it won't work.

233
00:10:17,423 --> 00:10:20,300
Scott: Is that to prevent cheating because people like making their own controllers?

234
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:26,620
Rym: It appears that if you have a controller, which I checked, it looks like my fighting stick would not work.

235
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:36,440
Rym: And you want to use it in the PS4, you have to log in with the DualShock 4 controller shit, which isn't in the old fight sticks.

236
00:10:37,761 --> 00:10:44,760
Rym: So to make that controller work, you have to go through all these menus and go to legacy controller authentication.

237
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:56,160
Rym: And then you have to set up your legacy controller and then you have to plug in a regular controller, like a regular DualShock 4, Playstation, whatever controller.

238
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,240
Rym: And use that to log in and all this nonsense.

239
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,177
Scott: So just play on Xbone or PC?

240
00:11:01,881 --> 00:11:07,040
Rym: So if you play on an Xbone, I believe it's fine because Xbox doesn't have as much of this nonsense.

241
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,340
Scott: Well I guess they're not using the controller for the nonsense, right?

242
00:11:11,121 --> 00:11:15,060
Rym: Yeah, but if you're on the PC, it's also a problem.

243
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:15,638
Scott: What do you mean?

244
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:25,390
Rym: So quote, "As for PC, Street Fighter 5 natively supports a number of devices, but those without X input functionality will not work until a promised future

245
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:25,610
Rym: patch.".

246
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:26,652
Rym: Oh, okay.

247
00:11:26,692 --> 00:11:35,190
Scott: So they pretty much only coded in support for certain controllers and they didn't support, you know, they only basically worked with the X input API for DirectX.

248
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:42,390
Scott: So if your controller is like using the old, I mean that's almost any controller you're going to use is going to use X input, right?

249
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:54,750
Scott: You'd have to get like some old busted like, you know, Thrustmaster flight stick thing, you know, that uses like the windows, like set up your analog controller thing to not work with that.

250
00:11:56,432 --> 00:11:57,380
Scott: That's not a real issue.

251
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,590
Scott: No one's using a non-X input controller.

252
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:07,290
Rym: So from what I can gather, more people are than you'd think because a lot of people have custom or old fighting sticks that are super awesome that might have art or whatever on them.

253
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:09,110
Rym: And those don't work anymore.

254
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,689
Scott: I mean, it had to be a pretty old fight because they are...

255
00:12:11,912 --> 00:12:13,450
Rym: It was widespread enough of a problem.

256
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,100
Scott: The fighting stick we have is an Xbox 360 controller.

257
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:16,983
Scott: It's using X input.

258
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:18,550
Scott: So it has to be even older than that.

259
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:28,410
Rym: And I'm saying that while I agree with you, there's enough people bitching on the internet that I guess there must be a community of people who have older controllers that don't do this.

260
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:35,869
Scott: I guess if you made your own controller, right, and you got the circuit board in your controller, it was not just an Xbox 360 controller that you opened up.

261
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:42,990
Rym: Well, like, so me and Scott back in the day, when we played Dance Dance Revolution, we'd buy these bootleg like dance mats.

262
00:12:43,633 --> 00:12:45,730
Rym: And when they finally died, it was always because the dance mats...

263
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,150
Scott: Those are just PlayStation controllers.

264
00:12:47,491 --> 00:12:48,693
Rym: Yeah, the dance mat was shitty.

265
00:12:49,134 --> 00:12:57,170
Rym: So when I made a hard DDR pad, I just took the circuit board out of the front of one of those things and wired it up to my hard pad.

266
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:58,790
Scott: Which is PS1 controller.

267
00:12:59,030 --> 00:12:59,970
Rym: And it totally worked.

268
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:00,478
Scott: Of course.

269
00:13:00,499 --> 00:13:00,687
Scott: Why not?

270
00:13:01,811 --> 00:13:02,212
Rym: Yeah.

271
00:13:02,232 --> 00:13:03,355
Rym: So, yeah, people are complaining about this.

272
00:13:03,395 --> 00:13:09,390
Rym: So apparently there's a workaround, but the workaround adds so much input lag that you can't actually play Street Fighter.

273
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,207
Rym: Some people were saying use joy to key and...

274
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,133
Scott: Fuck you, joy to key.

275
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:18,927
Rym: Joy to key is like the last ditch effort of Mad Men.

276
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:25,050
Rym: Like, that is, like, joy to key is one step before sniffing cocaine out of a gutter.

277
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,478
Scott: I never use joy to key.

278
00:13:26,558 --> 00:13:27,122
Scott: I never will.

279
00:13:27,162 --> 00:13:27,948
Scott: Anyone who uses it...

280
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:31,970
Rym: If the solution to your problem is joy to key, your problem is not worth solving.

281
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:32,510
Rym: That's right.

282
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,910
Rym: And the game was badly written, binding of Isaac.

283
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:37,429
Scott: I've played a lot of games that I've never needed to use joy to key.

284
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:41,550
Rym: I've played a lot of games that would have needed it, and I decided just to not use a controller.

285
00:13:42,395 --> 00:13:42,519
Scott: Mm-hmm.

286
00:13:43,275 --> 00:13:43,849
Scott: Just use the key.

287
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:44,386
Rym: Yeah.

288
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:45,609
Rym: Does he got any news?

289
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,790
Scott: It's only... I couldn't find a lot of gaming news, so I found this tiny news.

290
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,478
Scott: So today there's a big Steam sale.

291
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:52,650
Scott: It's not really a big Steam sale like all of Steam.

292
00:13:53,290 --> 00:14:01,090
Scott: It's a Steam sale on this one bundle of games, the Make War Not Love 3 prize one no cost from Sega.

293
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:07,090
Scott: So you get, for zero dollars, Golden Axe, the original, the good one.

294
00:14:07,732 --> 00:14:07,812
Rym: Whoa!

295
00:14:08,255 --> 00:14:10,650
Rym: It's not a great game, but I'd play it for zero dollars.

296
00:14:10,751 --> 00:14:14,270
Scott: Well, I mean, it's a game you can just emulate, but it's three dollars, Golden Axe.

297
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:14,663
Scott: Yeah.

298
00:14:14,931 --> 00:14:16,790
Scott: But it's zero dollars, because, you know, this bundle.

299
00:14:17,311 --> 00:14:22,568
Scott: A bunch of, like, hell yeah, rabbit something game that I never heard of.

300
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:24,549
Rym: Hell yeah, rabbit.

301
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:28,810
Scott: Yeah, the big deal, Jet Set Radio is in this, and you get it for zero dollars.

302
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:31,070
Rym: Wow, I forgot Jet Set Radio existed.

303
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,510
Scott: And then a Sega Classics thing.

304
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,370
Scott: So you get all these things together for zero dollars.

305
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:38,050
Scott: So if you have a Steam account, just make sure you click on this to get the games for zero dollars.

306
00:14:39,252 --> 00:14:44,690
Scott: But the question is why this Make War Not Love prize bundle one number three thing?

307
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,129
Rym: So do you know why, or are you asking?

308
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:55,030
Scott: Everyone's presuming that Sega is doing this for some sort of promotion of something coming soon that we're not sure of.

309
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:59,886
Scott: So, like, there's going to be some sort of something from Sega coming soon.

310
00:15:00,248 --> 00:15:00,930
Scott: that will be hot.

311
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:01,714
Rym: Sounds about right.

312
00:15:01,754 --> 00:15:09,029
Rym: I mean, like, if I was going to make a modern Rampart, I would definitely re-release the old Rampart for free on PCs.

313
00:15:11,292 --> 00:15:12,848
Rym: So I got one tiny news, too.

314
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:16,110
Rym: Because, as you know, full disclosure, I'm associated with Date Naito.

315
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:19,990
Rym: They make visual novels, so, you know, ethics in game journalism or whatever.

316
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:24,570
Rym: But one of our games, We Know the Devil is a pretty cool game.

317
00:15:25,411 --> 00:15:31,470
Rym: And one of the shiks is that it was going to be for sale for six dollars and sixty-six cents.

318
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:32,668
Scott: Haha, Satan.

319
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:38,510
Rym: And because of reasons, this was literally impossible to do on Steam.

320
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,669
Scott: Well, I mean, you can make it six-six everywhere else.

321
00:15:41,331 --> 00:15:45,170
Rym: Yeah, but on Steam, you could not make it six dollars and sixty-three.

322
00:15:45,531 --> 00:15:50,250
Rym: It ended up being six-sixty-three, and that was as close as they could get it.

323
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:51,235
Scott: Okay, so wait a second.

324
00:15:51,275 --> 00:15:54,130
Scott: So Steam is putting restrictions on the price you can set for a game.

325
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:59,650
Rym: There are prices you can set, like, at tiers, and you can't go between those.

326
00:16:00,151 --> 00:16:01,153
Scott: Okay, so here's the question.

327
00:16:01,173 --> 00:16:08,870
Scott: If you're going to make tiers, why wouldn't they be something logical, like, every fifty cent, or every twenty-five cent, or, you know, something like that?

328
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:11,196
Scott: Why would you even allow six-sixty-two?

329
00:16:11,216 --> 00:16:15,790
Scott: Would you just only allow six-fifty, six-ninety-nine, seven-fifty, seven-ninety-nine?

330
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,630
Rym: So it was going to be sold for six-sixty-six.

331
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,530
Scott: Maybe throw in seven-twenty-five and seven-four.

332
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:25,690
Rym: When it went live on Steam, it ended up being seven-ninety-nine, because that was the only price they could set.

333
00:16:26,011 --> 00:16:31,170
Rym: So a seventeen percent discount was used to get it as close to six-sixty-six as possible.

334
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:34,370
Scott: Oh, you can set percent discounts to adjust the price.

335
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:46,250
Rym: Yeah, so seven-ninety-nine, with a seventeen percent discount, got it to six-sixty-three, which is real close to the number that was actually the number of the beast in old documents, and also kind of close to six-sixty-six.

336
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:47,088
Scott: Uh-huh.

337
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:54,210
Scott: So, uh, I was gonna- Why not just set it to nine-ninety-nine, so that you can be an upside-down Mark of the Beast?

338
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:55,550
Rym: 'Cause then it costs a lot more money.

339
00:16:55,771 --> 00:16:58,429
Scott: Well, I mean, you know, steam premium price.

340
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:12,747
Rym: So, uh, I was gonna talk about this in more detail, but literally between when I realized what was going on and when we came home to do the show, there's an article on Kotaku from three-ten p.m.

341
00:17:12,787 --> 00:17:14,709
Rym: today talking about this, so...

342
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,453
Scott: There has to be maybe some other way, right?

343
00:17:17,473 --> 00:17:22,983
Scott: Like, if you gave it, what if the price is, like, twelve, whatever, you set it at a fifty percent discount, right?

344
00:17:23,063 --> 00:17:27,270
Scott: I feel like if you increased the percent discount, you could make a really high price and get it to six-sixty-six.

345
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:33,877
Rym: Well, so I'm pretty sure the reasons steam does this kind of thing, there's a bunch of, like, back-end business reasons.

346
00:17:33,897 --> 00:17:45,430
Rym: Like, for example, one of the really annoying things with, like, the Google Play Store or, I don't know, Amazon, is that you'll see things for sale for, like, five dollars and one cent, four dollars and ninety-six cents.

347
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:59,330
Rym: Because they're trying to, like, game each other and appear at different parts in the listings and, you know, show, like, shave a penny off the price, but then add a penny to the shipping and all sorts of, like, weird arbitrage engineering nonsense.

348
00:18:01,011 --> 00:18:06,200
Rym: Also, it's probably more efficient to have pricing tiers and, like, standard discounts and standard stuff.

349
00:18:07,122 --> 00:18:11,450
Rym: And pretty sure this is the only game in history where someone noticed and cared.

350
00:18:12,355 --> 00:18:13,401
Rym: I think that's the end of it.

351
00:18:13,421 --> 00:18:14,890
Rym: Someone noticed and cared.

352
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:17,208
Scott: If I was selling Doom, I would sell it for six-six.

353
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:21,589
Rym: Yeah, so we need John Carmack and John Romero.

354
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:22,869
Scott: They're not working on the new Doom.

355
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:27,790
Rym: I'm not saying they are, but I'm saying we need their voices to advocate that six-sixty-six needs to be an available tier.

356
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:30,569
Scott: But I think Doom will cost you sixty-six-sixty-six.

357
00:18:31,971 --> 00:18:34,210
Rym: Or sixty-six-sixty, actually, would be better, I think.

358
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:35,769
Scott: Sixty-nine-sixty-nine.

359
00:18:37,171 --> 00:18:39,050
Rym: That's real close to our old Wi-Fi password.

360
00:18:39,392 --> 00:18:41,910
Scott: You could have also given them a discount and made it cost four-twenty.

361
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:52,307
Rym: And also, one of the other games, Hustlecat, where you can date cats that turn into cute people, is on Steam Greenlight, but hasn't made it over the line yet.

362
00:18:52,387 --> 00:18:54,170
Rym: So, go click on it.

363
00:18:54,251 --> 00:18:55,670
Scott: What happens if it makes it over the line?

364
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:56,890
Rym: Then you can buy it on Steam.

365
00:18:57,691 --> 00:18:58,537
Scott: Oh, so it's already done?

366
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,429
Scott: You just can't buy it until it's...

367
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:04,950
Rym: It's not done, but it's going to be for sale soon, but it can't be for sale on Steam.

368
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:07,410
Scott: Then how come you can sell the Devil Game on Steam?

369
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,834
Rym: Because it got over the line.

370
00:19:09,095 --> 00:19:13,086
Rym: So, the Devil Game had a demographic that was very into it and got it greenlit.

371
00:19:13,628 --> 00:19:14,410
Rym: Way early.

372
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:16,082
Rym: Also, that game is just out.

373
00:19:16,162 --> 00:19:16,889
Rym: You can just buy it.

374
00:19:17,111 --> 00:19:19,090
Scott: Ah, but the cat game needs help to get over the line.

375
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,670
Rym: The cat game, I don't think enough people realize.

376
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:23,320
Scott: You'll be able to pay six-sixty-two for the cat game.

377
00:19:23,641 --> 00:19:25,950
Scott: You'll only be able to pay six-sixty-two for the Devil Game.

378
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:26,135
Scott: Yup.

379
00:19:26,611 --> 00:19:28,365
Scott: You'll have to buy the cat game from somewhere else.

380
00:19:28,446 --> 00:19:28,990
Scott: It's not Steam.

381
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:31,670
Rym: Yes, unless more people click yes on this thing.

382
00:19:31,931 --> 00:19:32,016
Scott: Okay.

383
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:36,510
Rym: And that's why... Oh, there are, however, right now, on it, sixty-nine comments.

384
00:19:37,111 --> 00:19:37,495
Scott: Alright.

385
00:19:37,515 --> 00:19:38,282
Rym: Sounds good.

386
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,750
Rym: But anyway, things of the day!

387
00:19:48,611 --> 00:19:53,330
Rym: If you know me at all, in fact, I see that bustin' thing just looking at me as the first recommended video.

388
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:54,489
Scott: Bustin', bustin', bustin'.

389
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:55,349
Rym: Makes me feel good.

390
00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:00,590
Rym: Neil Cicierega is the avatar of all the good parts of internet culture.

391
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:04,090
Rym: Like, you know, in fantasy worlds, the god of whatever...

392
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,870
Scott: We have sung his praises enough times.

393
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:10,570
Scott: All you need to know is that there is a person named Neil Cicierega, and they are the person who has made all the things.

394
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,730
Rym: Yeah, like, name ten weird internet things.

395
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:16,929
Scott: The creative genius of, perhaps, the half a generation younger than us.

396
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,250
Rym: Yeah, I'll put it this way.

397
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:19,127
Scott: Yeah, he's younger than us.

398
00:20:19,891 --> 00:20:24,110
Rym: Name, like, ten popular, well-known weird internet meme things.

399
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,070
Scott: He's made half of them, probably.

400
00:20:25,111 --> 00:20:25,849
Rym: Yeah, like, for real.

401
00:20:26,532 --> 00:20:28,469
Rym: And he made an opus.

402
00:20:29,151 --> 00:20:31,450
Rym: So, this is twenty-one minutes long.

403
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:35,449
Rym: It is basically an entire TV episode titled "Computer

404
00:20:35,469 --> 00:20:35,630
Rym: Fighters."

405
00:20:36,993 --> 00:20:37,829
Rym: Just watch it.

406
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:38,640
Rym: Like, don't.

407
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,130
Scott: Just watch it.

408
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,149
Scott: You stole my thing of the day.

409
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:42,770
Rym: Hey, who backs his Patreon?

410
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,549
Scott: This is the best thing that I've seen on the internet in weeks.

411
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:50,850
Rym: It is the best thing I've seen on the internet, other than that suicide shower head that I'm gonna talk about next week.

412
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:56,190
Rym: But, the production values on this thing are pretty off the hook and independently.

413
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:57,641
Rym: If you are around...

414
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:02,289
Scott: There's, like, this set of all-star people helping out, and it's like, "Oh, just he needed the

415
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:02,490
Scott: help.".

416
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,329
Scott: Yeah, okay, yeah.

417
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:06,409
Scott: If you're between twenty- That's the person who needs the help from all these geniuses.

418
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:07,890
Scott: The genius himself, sure.

419
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:13,470
Rym: If you're between twenty-eight and thirty-eight years old, this is gonna hit real close to home in a lot of ways.

420
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,269
Scott: Alright, so I had to go to a backup thing of the day.

421
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:18,721
Scott: So, there's a YouTube video called "Bolt for

422
00:21:18,741 --> 00:21:19,184
Scott: Brilliance."

423
00:21:20,593 --> 00:21:23,690
Scott: And in this video, a man bolts for brilliance.

424
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,790
Scott: I don't know how much more I should talk about it, but I guess I will.

425
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:35,470
Scott: So, you know how at sporting events, there's the old, especially soccer, especially in Europe, there's the streaker?

426
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:41,110
Rym: They take it off, they run across the field, they get- I'm pulling up the video, I'm just gonna watch it while you're talking.

427
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:45,190
Scott: This is the full day in the life of the man who bolts for brilliance.

428
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:50,390
Scott: It begins with, you know, before even going to the stadium, you know, the preparations inside.

429
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:51,709
Rym: Oh, this already looks real good.

430
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:56,330
Scott: And then, you know, climax with, you know, the event.

431
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:01,190
Scott: Alright, so now you know what it's like to be a day in the life of a person with this occupation.

432
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:04,670
Scott: What goes through their minds, why they're doing this, how they get it done.

433
00:22:05,233 --> 00:22:07,103
Rym: This is- I don't even have the sound on.

434
00:22:07,123 --> 00:22:08,310
Rym: This actually looks really great.

435
00:22:08,771 --> 00:22:09,330
Scott: Proper techniques.

436
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:10,835
Rym: He's like, he's ready.

437
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:13,290
Rym: Like, he's got this really determined look on his face.

438
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,949
Scott: Alright, you're almost at the really- the best part.

439
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:16,109
Rym: When he actually does it?

440
00:22:16,311 --> 00:22:17,664
Rym: Yeah, just- I see him queuing up.

441
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,409
Scott: This is the best part, here it comes.

442
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:21,490
Rym: Okay, so he's queuing up his thing.

443
00:22:22,135 --> 00:22:22,770
Rym: Oh, there he goes!

444
00:22:23,912 --> 00:22:26,830
Rym: The best part is the guy in yellow who goes like that.

445
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:28,662
Rym: Is he flicking everybody?

446
00:22:28,703 --> 00:22:29,230
Rym: Oh, he's waving.

447
00:22:33,631 --> 00:22:34,134
Rym: The run.

448
00:22:34,154 --> 00:22:37,870
Rym: I feel like if I watch the beginning of the video more, he practiced that run.

449
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,330
Rym: The floppy arm thing he's doing.

450
00:22:41,974 --> 00:22:42,989
Rym: This is a pretty good thing of the day.

451
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,185
Scott: Alright, there you go.

452
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:51,170
Rym: In the meta moment, we're gonna do a new book club soon because nine books into the Wheel of Time.

453
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:51,798
Rym: Whoa!

454
00:22:53,274 --> 00:22:54,748
Rym: I'm getting a little bored with it.

455
00:22:56,852 --> 00:23:00,250
Scott: I made it to five- oh, I guess four and a quarter.

456
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:02,204
Rym: I am almost done with book nine.

457
00:23:02,224 --> 00:23:02,729
Rym: I gotta tell ya.

458
00:23:03,751 --> 00:23:04,729
Rym: I started skimming.

459
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:09,339
Rym: Because- but then I thought, you know what?

460
00:23:09,781 --> 00:23:11,730
Rym: Maybe I'll just read the spoilers.

461
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,950
Rym: 'Cause I kinda wanna know, like, what the deal is with everything.

462
00:23:14,437 --> 00:23:15,089
Scott: Oh, tell me.

463
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:17,130
Rym: Yeah, I started trying to read some spoilers.

464
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:21,150
Rym: The spoilers are so dense that I might as well just fucking read the book.

465
00:23:21,951 --> 00:23:22,839
Rym: Here's the cliff note.

466
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,890
Scott: It's bigger than the book.

467
00:23:24,254 --> 00:23:25,730
Scott: It's like our Utena video.

468
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:27,810
Scott: It's longer than the Utena episode.

469
00:23:27,932 --> 00:23:28,989
Rym: Remember the oath rod thing?

470
00:23:29,711 --> 00:23:32,330
Rym: So, now there's like four oath rods all over the place.

471
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:33,990
Rym: People are fucking using them for everything.

472
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:34,949
Rym: Like, all the time.

473
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:37,730
Rym: And apparently they learned that the oath rod has side effects.

474
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:39,329
Rym: And I tried to learn what the deal was with that.

475
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:40,767
Scott: Why would you want to make so many oaths?

476
00:23:42,193 --> 00:23:43,229
Rym: Maybe to find the black aja.

477
00:23:44,511 --> 00:23:44,808
Scott: Okay.

478
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,968
Rym: Yeah, maybe to be like, "Yo, swear that you're not black

479
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:47,190
Rym: aja.".

480
00:23:47,535 --> 00:23:48,187
Rym: Oh, you won't?

481
00:23:50,813 --> 00:23:52,309
Rym: Also, the oath rods are real bad news.

482
00:23:53,115 --> 00:23:55,030
Rym: Like, real bad news.

483
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:56,690
Scott: Did you find anything about the snake people?

484
00:23:57,606 --> 00:23:57,669
Rym: No.

485
00:23:59,114 --> 00:24:00,450
Rym: So, here's what I got.

486
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:09,129
Rym: In the beginning of, I think, book eight, or it might have been book nine, there's a scene way in the mountains with a bunch of people you've never heard of who are all like kings of whatever.

487
00:24:09,551 --> 00:24:10,809
Scott: Ooh, my kind of scene.

488
00:24:11,231 --> 00:24:14,430
Rym: One of them has a logo on his thing.

489
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:15,247
Scott: Of the snake people?

490
00:24:15,471 --> 00:24:17,070
Rym: No, of the fox head.

491
00:24:17,551 --> 00:24:17,886
Scott: Okay.

492
00:24:18,672 --> 00:24:20,189
Rym: And then it cut away from them.

493
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:22,190
Rym: And now it's been like two books.

494
00:24:22,652 --> 00:24:23,488
Rym: And they haven't come back.

495
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,029
Scott: Those are my people.

496
00:24:28,614 --> 00:24:30,110
Rym: That is literally as close as I've gotten to them.

497
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:32,969
Rym: So, I might pick a different book club book.

498
00:24:33,832 --> 00:24:36,590
Rym: Partly because I got some travel to London and Paris coming up in a few months.

499
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:39,510
Rym: So, I'll have an airplane ride or four to read some books.

500
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:42,230
Rym: But, most important, this weekend.

501
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:43,489
Rym: This weekend.

502
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:44,469
Scott: Well, this week.

503
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,350
Scott: Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

504
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:48,630
Rym: We're going to be at MagFest.

505
00:24:51,011 --> 00:24:52,709
Rym: I'm real excited about this.

506
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:56,110
Scott: I mean, this is serious business.

507
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:57,850
Scott: Like, everyone is going to be there.

508
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:59,970
Rym: Yeah, one, we skipped the last MagFest.

509
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:01,710
Scott: Well, because PacSouth is the same time.

510
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:07,710
Rym: Yeah, and so as a result, I just realized that it's been a long time since I've been to a MagFest.

511
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,369
Rym: And I remembered how much I love MagFest.

512
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,230
Scott: This MagFest, everyone is going.

513
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:14,210
Scott: Our Google Hangout already has like 30 people.

514
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:17,530
Rym: Yeah, we're going to need multiple separate Google Hangouts to manage these people.

515
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,988
Scott: Yeah, this shit is going down hard, right?

516
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,797
Rym: We've already planned a 4 a.m.

517
00:25:22,838 --> 00:25:23,621
Rym: DDR party.

518
00:25:23,661 --> 00:25:25,650
Rym: that I was kind of jokingly proposing.

519
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:26,788
Rym: And a bunch of people were like,

520
00:25:26,808 --> 00:25:26,869
Rym: "Yes.".

521
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:28,628
Scott: You just keep saying it over and over again.

522
00:25:29,131 --> 00:25:31,060
Rym: Because people keep responding to me like, "Yes.

523
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:32,044
Rym: Yes.

524
00:25:32,527 --> 00:25:32,989
Rym: Let's do

525
00:25:33,049 --> 00:25:33,089
Rym: it.".

526
00:25:33,311 --> 00:25:35,550
Scott: Alright, so what panels are we doing at this MagFest?

527
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:38,450
Rym: So, we have six panels at this MagFest.

528
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:39,376
Scott: That's too many panels.

529
00:25:39,417 --> 00:25:41,290
Scott: I want to spend more time at MagFest, less time panel.

530
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:42,650
Rym: You're only on five of them, though.

531
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:45,130
Rym: No, you're on four of them, I think.

532
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,110
Scott: Okay, that's better.

533
00:25:46,572 --> 00:25:49,082
Rym: So, Thursday, 5.30 p.m.

534
00:25:49,444 --> 00:25:49,946
Rym: Esports.

535
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:50,850
Rym: It's a panel about Esports.

536
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:51,689
Scott: Am I on that one?

537
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:52,457
Rym: Yes.

538
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:53,570
Rym: Thursday, whatever.

539
00:25:54,271 --> 00:25:55,223
Rym: Friday is our big day.

540
00:25:55,264 --> 00:25:55,770
Rym: We front-loaded.

541
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:59,830
Rym: So, Friday, we got Designing Game Rules, Atari Game Design.

542
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:02,585
Rym: If you saw us do those at PacSouth, basically the same.

543
00:26:02,605 --> 00:26:03,129
Rym: You don't need to go.

544
00:26:03,891 --> 00:26:06,589
Rym: And The Far Future of Gaming, which Scott does not have to be on.

545
00:26:06,771 --> 00:26:07,286
Scott: Alright, yeah.

546
00:26:08,274 --> 00:26:08,590
Scott: Saturday.

547
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:09,230
Scott: Gonna party it up.

548
00:26:09,631 --> 00:26:12,130
Rym: All Things is CCG, LCG, TCG.

549
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:14,489
Scott: I guess I gotta be on that because it was my idea.

550
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:18,289
Scott: Even though I contributed nothing to it, other than saying, "Hey, does anyone want to talk about

551
00:26:18,329 --> 00:26:18,450
Scott: this?".

552
00:26:18,511 --> 00:26:19,726
Scott: That's literally all I said.

553
00:26:19,766 --> 00:26:20,070
Scott: Literally.

554
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,201
Rym: I think someone's got some slides.

555
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:23,601
Scott: I said, "Hey, does anyone...".

556
00:26:23,722 --> 00:26:24,650
Scott: I play Netrunner a lot.

557
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:27,106
Scott: "Does anyone want to do a panel about card games and

558
00:26:27,126 --> 00:26:27,327
Scott: shit?".

559
00:26:27,912 --> 00:26:29,970
Scott: And that's paraphrasing, but that's all I said.

560
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:31,769
Scott: And then now the panel's on the schedule.

561
00:26:32,371 --> 00:26:33,130
Rym: It's gonna happen.

562
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:34,590
Scott: I guess my name is on it.

563
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:40,270
Rym: And then Overly Complicated Board Games Phase 1, which Scott does not have to be on.

564
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:40,873
Scott: Okay, good.

565
00:26:40,893 --> 00:26:42,382
Scott: I don't want to play any ASL.

566
00:26:42,663 --> 00:26:43,730
Scott: I was only joking about that.

567
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:45,516
Rym: Six panels.

568
00:26:46,342 --> 00:26:47,530
Rym: Thursday, Friday, Saturday.

569
00:26:48,211 --> 00:26:53,650
Rym: And other than that, we're pretty much gonna be in the arcade or in tabletop or in a private room playing Eclipse.

570
00:26:53,891 --> 00:26:54,346
Scott: That's right.

571
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,333
Rym: So come say hi.

572
00:26:56,614 --> 00:27:01,070
Rym: This is one of the few cons where you can easily find us and hang out for a while.

573
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:06,850
Scott: Yeah, there isn't a super big concert I want to go to, but there were some concerts I kind of want to go to, right?

574
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:08,599
Scott: There was this video game.

575
00:27:08,639 --> 00:27:10,110
Scott: DJ battle is always good.

576
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:11,969
Rym: I think I'm gonna wander into concerts.

577
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:12,596
Scott: Mighty No.

578
00:27:12,596 --> 00:27:13,930
Scott: 9 tribute something.

579
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:20,749
Scott: There's some stuff on there, but it wasn't like two times ago that I went to MAGFest where Streets of Rage guy was there.

580
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:24,869
Scott: Or when Machine Supremacy was there the time we went and then the time we didn't go.

581
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:28,450
Rym: I think I Fight Dragons is doing some stuff.

582
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:29,088
Scott: That's not bad.

583
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:30,208
Scott: That's not bad.

584
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:32,136
Rym: So MAGFest.

585
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,749
Rym: Well, if you're not going, I mean, I don't know if it's sold out.

586
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,986
Scott: It's not sold out, but it's gonna be hard to get a hotel.

587
00:27:37,026 --> 00:27:37,450
Scott: that's close.

588
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:38,392
Rym: Yeah.

589
00:27:39,416 --> 00:27:40,581
Rym: In fact, I don't know.

590
00:27:40,601 --> 00:27:42,530
Rym: I guess you could get a hotel far away and drive in.

591
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:44,410
Rym: A lot of people are driving in like our friend George.

592
00:27:44,973 --> 00:27:47,270
Scott: It also might be close to sold out, right?

593
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:50,150
Scott: So you might have issues if you try to like show up and buy a ticket.

594
00:27:50,472 --> 00:27:51,869
Scott: It could be sold out by the time you get there.

595
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:54,544
Rym: Yeah, but for real, the clock is ringing.

596
00:27:54,584 --> 00:27:55,610
Rym: It's MAGFest time.

597
00:27:56,531 --> 00:28:00,370
Rym: And then we got pretty much nothing until like zinc icon in PAX East.

598
00:28:01,893 --> 00:28:07,070
Rym: So yesterday, actually, we were gonna do a game day and I had a little bit of alien that I was fighting off.

599
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:10,390
Rym: So Scott was like, well, here, why don't we play online games?

600
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:14,430
Scott: Well, me and Chris are going to come over here and play some serious tabletops.

601
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:16,958
Scott: But then, you know, you didn't commit.

602
00:28:17,058 --> 00:28:20,310
Scott: And then it's like, well, you know, it's really snowy and shitty.

603
00:28:20,792 --> 00:28:22,130
Scott: No one wants to leave their apartment.

604
00:28:22,611 --> 00:28:26,750
Rym: I would have been totally up for it, except I was, you know, that feeling where you're almost sick.

605
00:28:27,431 --> 00:28:31,390
Rym: And one, if I was going to get sick, I couldn't risk getting other people sick before MAGFest.

606
00:28:32,233 --> 00:28:35,070
Rym: Two, I needed to make sure I recovered, which I appear to have.

607
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,635
Scott: So I'm like, hey, let's play a vidya game.

608
00:28:36,675 --> 00:28:41,810
Scott: So actually we found this site that's like still working on some like online thing where you can play board games.

609
00:28:42,091 --> 00:28:45,467
Scott: And we played some Reiner Knizia Samurai, which I remember how to play now.

610
00:28:45,587 --> 00:28:46,070
Scott: That game's OK.

611
00:28:46,431 --> 00:28:47,824
Rym: Oh, that's the one with the high hats.

612
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:52,250
Scott: They changed it to Buddha's helmets or Gates helmets and rice bowls.

613
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:52,987
Rym: No more Buddhas?

614
00:28:53,953 --> 00:28:55,970
Scott: Well, I mean, the gate is up to a Buddhist temple.

615
00:28:57,191 --> 00:28:59,150
Rym: That's the second best game named Shogun.

616
00:28:59,872 --> 00:29:00,133
Scott: Yeah.

617
00:29:00,455 --> 00:29:01,924
Scott: Anyway, we played Samurai.

618
00:29:04,722 --> 00:29:04,986
Scott: I don't know.

619
00:29:05,006 --> 00:29:05,310
Scott: Whatever.

620
00:29:05,591 --> 00:29:06,370
Rym: No, it was Shogun.

621
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:07,890
Rym: It got renamed Samurai swords.

622
00:29:08,592 --> 00:29:12,830
Scott: And then anyway, so, you know, we're just looking for a game to play online.

623
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:19,528
Scott: And we're sort of it's hard to actually find games that are a good good enough.

624
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:20,351
Scott: Right.

625
00:29:20,371 --> 00:29:25,170
Scott: And that you can play online on a PC with some sort of co-op situation.

626
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:25,331
Scott: Right.

627
00:29:25,351 --> 00:29:29,670
Scott: There's a lot of local co-op, a lot of local multiplayer, a lot of more than two people games.

628
00:29:30,331 --> 00:29:31,700
Scott: But it's hard to find two people games.

629
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,310
Scott: They're just going through steam looking for them.

630
00:29:33,932 --> 00:29:35,950
Scott: And it's like we already played like Portal two co-op.

631
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:36,674
Scott: And it's not like.

632
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:39,209
Scott: how many FPS are there that we can find that are co-op.

633
00:29:39,531 --> 00:29:39,732
Scott: Right.

634
00:29:39,773 --> 00:29:40,398
Scott: That would be fun.

635
00:29:40,458 --> 00:29:41,830
Scott: But there's not a lot of them.

636
00:29:42,131 --> 00:29:46,690
Scott: So we come across this one called Helldivers and I'm like, oh, this looks interesting.

637
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:49,810
Scott: You know, it's a. it's sort of like a robotron shooter.

638
00:29:49,951 --> 00:29:51,530
Scott: That's always good for some co-op action.

639
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:52,801
Rym: That's all Scott told me about it.

640
00:29:52,842 --> 00:29:53,590
Rym: So I just joined it.

641
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:54,637
Scott: I didn't know anything about it.

642
00:29:54,678 --> 00:29:56,390
Scott: I just thought, oh, it's a robotron game.

643
00:29:56,931 --> 00:29:59,930
Scott: It costs 20 bucks, which I'd rather wait for a steam sale.

644
00:30:00,471 --> 00:30:00,854
Scott: But you know what?

645
00:30:00,894 --> 00:30:01,177
Scott: Fuck it.

646
00:30:01,197 --> 00:30:02,530
Scott: It's really cold out and I got nothing to do.

647
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:03,314
Scott: Let's just do this.

648
00:30:04,059 --> 00:30:05,830
Scott: We'll do an episode on it, even if it sucks.

649
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:07,559
Scott: It'll you know, we'll get our 20 bucks worth.

650
00:30:07,579 --> 00:30:09,389
Scott: Plus there's that steam refund policy.

651
00:30:10,572 --> 00:30:12,589
Scott: I can always return it real quick if it's really bad.

652
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:13,152
Rym: Yeah.

653
00:30:13,213 --> 00:30:14,650
Rym: So you and Chris played for a little while.

654
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:17,010
Scott: Played for a little while while Rym got his shit together.

655
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:22,270
Rym: Well, because I was in the middle of uploading actually the archival footage from Pac South to Amazon Cloud Drive.

656
00:30:22,371 --> 00:30:23,426
Scott: I'll get my SD card back.

657
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:23,730
Scott: Oh, yeah.

658
00:30:25,832 --> 00:30:27,482
Scott: So the card anyway.

659
00:30:27,623 --> 00:30:28,670
Scott: So we get this game.

660
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:30,018
Scott: So here's what I learned about this game.

661
00:30:30,058 --> 00:30:31,770
Scott: First of all, it's made by the people in Magica.

662
00:30:32,371 --> 00:30:37,230
Scott: So they have experience with the sort of twin stick action, you know, of that.

663
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,697
Scott: Magica was right.

664
00:30:38,757 --> 00:30:40,506
Scott: So they're good at this, too.

665
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:42,573
Scott: I learned from Wikipedia.

666
00:30:42,614 --> 00:30:47,410
Scott: this game was actually a PlayStation game that was released in March of 2015.

667
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:51,851
Scott: So it's like it's a year old, but it wasn't put on steam until December 2015.

668
00:30:51,851 --> 00:30:56,130
Scott: So it's actually a really new steam game and you could only play it on steam.

669
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:58,120
Scott: You don't play with the PlayStation people.

670
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:58,704
Rym: Thank God.

671
00:30:58,724 --> 00:30:59,609
Rym: Right.

672
00:31:00,272 --> 00:31:02,950
Scott: So you're all you know, it's only steam people when you play with steam.

673
00:31:03,671 --> 00:31:06,719
Scott: So it's a robotron shooter.

674
00:31:07,541 --> 00:31:11,230
Scott: And the story is there's this super Starship Troopers.

675
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:12,921
Rym: The story is Starship Troopers.

676
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:13,969
Scott: It's Super Earth.

677
00:31:14,531 --> 00:31:16,057
Rym: You're on super democracy.

678
00:31:16,378 --> 00:31:19,170
Scott: You're from Super Earth and you're basically evil.

679
00:31:19,971 --> 00:31:20,212
Rym: Yeah.

680
00:31:20,453 --> 00:31:21,678
Rym: And the game doesn't even like.

681
00:31:21,698 --> 00:31:23,786
Rym: the propaganda video that plays.

682
00:31:23,826 --> 00:31:26,780
Rym: in the beginning is like, hey, we're evil.

683
00:31:27,504 --> 00:31:28,610
Scott: Join the Helldivers.

684
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:33,429
Scott: Go to some other planet and fuck it up and bring them managed democracy.

685
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:36,310
Rym: The new when you first start the game after you do the tutorial.

686
00:31:36,651 --> 00:31:40,890
Rym: I love how the tutorial is like like it's like take pick up your gun and shoot that target.

687
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:43,850
Rym: You shoot it once and it's like you are now a firearms expert.

688
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:45,457
Rym: Move on to the next training.

689
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,630
Rym: You are now a grenade expert.

690
00:31:48,293 --> 00:31:48,554
Rym: Right.

691
00:31:48,594 --> 00:31:50,543
Rym: And then it gets you into the first NPC.

692
00:31:50,583 --> 00:31:52,050
Rym: I talked to the whole game.

693
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:56,750
Rym: The guy who salutes you in the bottom right just said, why is our logo a skull?

694
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:58,833
Scott: Good question.

695
00:31:59,797 --> 00:32:00,680
Scott: So, yeah.

696
00:32:00,921 --> 00:32:03,030
Scott: So there's three different evil alien races.

697
00:32:03,391 --> 00:32:05,862
Scott: There's the aliens, the cyborgs and the one I forget.

698
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,450
Scott: I forget bugs.

699
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:10,820
Scott: No bugs, cyborgs and I don't know.

700
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:13,670
Scott: I've only ever seen bugs because we only chose bug levels.

701
00:32:13,911 --> 00:32:14,172
Rym: Yeah.

702
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:14,794
Scott: Right.

703
00:32:15,075 --> 00:32:19,090
Scott: So you go and choose, you know, some mission based on his difficulty.

704
00:32:20,431 --> 00:32:30,030
Scott: And you have to do certain objectives and then, you know, evac the planet, you know, after you do whatever missions there are and then you succeed in a certain number of missions per planet.

705
00:32:30,492 --> 00:32:33,070
Scott: And once you do all the missions on the planet, you succeeded at that planet.

706
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:38,910
Scott: And now you can go do another planet somewhere and you bring with you one to four Helldivers.

707
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:41,470
Scott: You and up to three other people could be random Internet people.

708
00:32:41,591 --> 00:32:44,470
Scott: Could be your friends, could be you alone, you know, whatever.

709
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:47,255
Scott: And you do these missions.

710
00:32:47,938 --> 00:32:51,790
Scott: And at first you start playing the game and it seems like way too easy.

711
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:53,720
Scott: Like the easiest missions are baby missions.

712
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,690
Scott: Like you shoot one thing and you just do it.

713
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:56,394
Scott: It's done right.

714
00:32:56,857 --> 00:32:58,850
Scott: But the difficulty gets up pretty high.

715
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:03,010
Rym: And then I knew it was good because I was yelling so much that Emily was like, simmer down.

716
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:03,631
Scott: Right.

717
00:33:04,072 --> 00:33:08,890
Scott: And it seemed, you know, I started playing the game a bunch and it really felt like there wasn't a lot of variation.

718
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:09,834
Scott: Like I was getting a little bored.

719
00:33:09,874 --> 00:33:13,730
Scott: I was like, hey, we've been shooting the same bugs and doing the same objectives.

720
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:16,537
Scott: This is getting kind of old fast.

721
00:33:16,618 --> 00:33:16,939
Scott: Right.

722
00:33:16,959 --> 00:33:17,340
Scott: Can we.

723
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:19,187
Scott: Is there any variation here?

724
00:33:19,267 --> 00:33:19,909
Scott: What's going on?

725
00:33:20,611 --> 00:33:27,630
Scott: So the thing is, yeah, there's actually a shit ton of variation that it just you don't see it until you like get deep into it.

726
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:33,150
Scott: Like the depth is like way deep, but you can't like see the bottom of the pool.

727
00:33:33,251 --> 00:33:36,149
Scott: You just got to keep swimming slower, like inch by inch.

728
00:33:36,411 --> 00:33:38,723
Rym: Like at first we thought, like, let's just drop right on the objectives.

729
00:33:38,763 --> 00:33:40,010
Rym: And then that started to not work.

730
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,874
Rym: So we had to like plan our routes.

731
00:33:41,995 --> 00:33:54,489
Scott: And it's like with such small amounts of stuff, like so few weapons and so few different enemies, like the amount of thinking that had to go into everything and like, you know, the gameplay variation we had to get into was actually like, whoa.

732
00:33:54,970 --> 00:34:03,450
Rym: So the way it actually plays the game that it is closest to and this might sound strange, but I'm going to stick by this is the original Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.

733
00:34:03,671 --> 00:34:09,290
Rym: Yeah, it definitely closes today because that game started out like, all right, just hit the bad guys, whatever.

734
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:18,290
Rym: But as you got deep and toward the end of the original Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, you started figuring out how to do those like really complicated spell combos.

735
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:32,070
Rym: Suddenly, the game was like a squad of like Scott doing stuff while me and Katsu are literally like coordinating with each other, with code words to figure out like what attacks to do to make sure we time everything, coordinate everything right.

736
00:34:32,371 --> 00:34:34,983
Rym: And we started having to act like a really pro unit.

737
00:34:35,405 --> 00:34:36,510
Rym: And this game is the same way.

738
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:43,330
Rym: Like we sort of had this roll out phase where like we get our shit together and I'd roll out a turret and you guys would do whatever you were doing and then we go.

739
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:47,420
Scott: The key is there's three keys that make this happen.

740
00:34:47,561 --> 00:34:50,710
Scott: Key number one is they don't let you go off the screen from the other people.

741
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:58,850
Scott: So if one person is going up and I was going down, you just get killed doing that because that person on top will get killed by something that's off screen to the top that you can't see.

742
00:34:59,432 --> 00:35:03,850
Scott: And then the person at the bottom will get killed by something off the bottom of the screen that you can't see because you were trying to split up.

743
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:07,690
Scott: And the camera won't zoom out after a certain point and you'll just be screwed.

744
00:35:08,472 --> 00:35:11,210
Scott: So that makes like Crystal Chronicles with a bucket where you have to stay together.

745
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:15,260
Scott: Number two, friendly fire is serious shit.

746
00:35:15,862 --> 00:35:18,350
Scott: Like if you even shoot your teammate once, they dead.

747
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:22,770
Rym: Like you know most games like this, like you can throw down a turret and it shoots the bad guys automatically.

748
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:27,190
Rym: The turret in this game is utterly ridiculously powerful.

749
00:35:27,491 --> 00:35:31,370
Scott: It's also really stupid and will shoot you if you were between it and the bad guy.

750
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:38,250
Rym: There was a moment where I literally threw, I had two turrets on either side of me and then a bug, like a camouflage bug jumped on top of me.

751
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:41,045
Rym: And the two turrets, I see them spinning around and I'm like,

752
00:35:41,065 --> 00:35:41,145
Rym: "Welp.".

753
00:35:43,251 --> 00:35:46,182
Scott: So yeah, the turrets will, you know, there are many, many things.

754
00:35:46,202 --> 00:35:47,186
Scott: For example, there are mechs.

755
00:35:47,206 --> 00:35:48,010
Scott: You didn't see the mechs.

756
00:35:48,393 --> 00:35:49,329
Scott: I haven't seen any mechs.

757
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:50,036
Scott: I played online.

758
00:35:50,056 --> 00:35:51,369
Scott: Yeah, there's a lot of stuff you didn't see.

759
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:57,689
Scott: And it's like, yeah, if you're piloting the mech, you can just step on people by accident who aren't in the mech.

760
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:06,750
Rym: Well, you can call down, I remember there was Scott, so Chris and I died and Scott was running away and he like threw down the thing to call in reinforcements, basically to respawn us.

761
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:12,130
Scott: Yeah, you can respawn your friends just by throwing this object, but you have to like get to a place to do it safely.

762
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:19,050
Rym: So then you got like attacked by some other guy and he pushed you back and then the respawn thing fell from the sky on top of you, killing you.

763
00:36:19,493 --> 00:36:20,169
Scott: Yup, exactly.

764
00:36:20,392 --> 00:36:22,270
Rym: Or like the chopper, like at the end you have to get to the chopper.

765
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:25,190
Scott: There's all these things that you can call for to come help you.

766
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:34,030
Scott: Stratagems, and you basically throw an object as a stratagem and then, you know, the helldivers in the sky drop something and it lands in the spot that you threw the stratagem.

767
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,515
Rym: Now there's two great aspects there.

768
00:36:35,636 --> 00:36:39,330
Rym: One, the stratagems and the weapons and everything have an upgrade tech tree, which is fun.

769
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:46,730
Rym: And two, to actually deploy them, it's Sabin style Final Fantasy VI, like left, left, right, left, up, up, down, left, right.

770
00:36:47,072 --> 00:36:48,190
Scott: Yup, it's like doing a blitz.

771
00:36:48,431 --> 00:36:56,290
Rym: Yeah, so like some of the objectives are like that too, so like to arm the nuke you got to go over and be like bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup while everyone else is doing their shit.

772
00:36:56,490 --> 00:37:00,150
Scott: So actually we were using the hellbombs to do that mission where you blow up the nests.

773
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:00,520
Rym: Yup.

774
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:05,930
Scott: People I played with just had actual nukes and just called them in and blew up the nests immediately without having to activate some stupid thing.

775
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:06,272
Scott: Oh.

776
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:09,710
Scott: Yeah, so there is just better stuff, right, that you can get.

777
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:10,908
Rym: Would the air strike do it?

778
00:37:11,891 --> 00:37:15,665
Scott: I mean there's certain things that can damage the nests because they're strong enough and certain things that can't.

779
00:37:15,685 --> 00:37:16,970
Scott: I think they have tank level armors.

780
00:37:17,131 --> 00:37:22,250
Scott: Actually, my recoilless rifle could have destroyed them if we shot them enough times.

781
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:26,190
Rym: And then yeah, like talking about the depth, so Scott had the recoilless rifle.

782
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:27,513
Scott: Which is a really fun weapon.

783
00:37:28,155 --> 00:37:29,939
Scott: Once I figured out how to use it, I was way into it.

784
00:37:29,959 --> 00:37:34,050
Scott: Because basically any time a really big bad guy appears, it really sucks to kill it.

785
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:35,695
Scott: Especially because ammo is so limited.

786
00:37:36,136 --> 00:37:41,250
Scott: But if the recoilless rifle is like this special thing, it's actually a stratagem that you call down and then pick up.

787
00:37:41,791 --> 00:37:44,144
Scott: You shoot it once and if you hit them dead on, they dead.

788
00:37:44,204 --> 00:37:45,170
Scott: And I got really good at that.

789
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:49,105
Rym: And it felt really good because we'd be like fighting and suddenly Chris would yell "Big one coming

790
00:37:49,185 --> 00:37:49,266
Rym: in!"

791
00:37:49,306 --> 00:37:50,270
Rym: and then you see it coming in.

792
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:53,770
Scott: So I just switch to that weapon, I aim and I fire my one rocket and boom, it's dead.

793
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:58,530
Rym: While the two of us fall back and cover Scott while he's aiming from all the little bugs that are coming in.

794
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:03,170
Scott: Right, if I hit something, and a lot of times I would shoot it and hit something too close to myself and kill myself.

795
00:38:04,332 --> 00:38:06,182
Scott: Or something would get in the way and it wouldn't work.

796
00:38:06,282 --> 00:38:07,609
Scott: But mostly I hit the bad guys with it.

797
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:10,950
Rym: A lot of stuff too, like the medevac copter coming down.

798
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:19,890
Scott: So reloading the recoilless rifle is really slow, but I found out when playing with people online that there's actually this supply pack that goes with it.

799
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:25,227
Scott: So Rym picked up my supply pack once and I was like "Rym, you took my stupid supply pack, how can I reload this stupid rifle now?

800
00:38:25,287 --> 00:38:25,488
Scott: Fuck

801
00:38:25,508 --> 00:38:25,608
Scott: you.".

802
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:29,460
Scott: Apparently, if Rym has the supply pack, there's a reason it's separate.

803
00:38:29,721 --> 00:38:32,630
Scott: He can help me reload the thing and it would take much less time.

804
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,309
Rym: That's real important.

805
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:35,777
Scott: Yeah, we didn't know that.

806
00:38:36,461 --> 00:38:37,890
Scott: So now that we know that, that's great.

807
00:38:38,311 --> 00:38:45,790
Rym: So take all the gameplay feels of Crystal Chronicles, coupled with an upgrade tree that's more like a Deus Ex, like there's legit upgrade tree in there.

808
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:48,659
Scott: Yeah, but it's all co-op, there's no PVP at all.

809
00:38:48,699 --> 00:38:51,769
Scott: It's always you and up to three other people fighting against the AI.

810
00:38:52,191 --> 00:38:53,749
Rym: Oh, I figured out what the SOS does too.

811
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:55,570
Scott: Oh, it calls people from the internet to come help you.

812
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:57,230
Rym: It calls a rando into your game.

813
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:58,824
Scott: Yeah, it's like "Internet, come help

814
00:38:58,926 --> 00:38:58,986
Scott: us.".

815
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:04,270
Rym: So there's theoretically a persistent meta, where as you level up, you just get better.

816
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:10,950
Rym: This is not a game that you would play forever, because once you've upgraded everything, I'm pretty sure...

817
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:16,130
Scott: Yeah, you're playing the same missions, and eventually when you do the hell dive level missions, those are the hardest possible missions.

818
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:20,870
Scott: If you've done enough of those and you've leveled up all the stuff, there's really not a reason to keep playing.

819
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:25,190
Rym: And that is when you stop playing the game, because it was only 20 bucks and you put like 60 hours into this thing.

820
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:32,890
Scott: But whenever you complete a mission, you actually have community influence, so this actually boosts the war effort in general with these points.

821
00:39:33,431 --> 00:39:41,669
Scott: So as the war effort progresses, eventually there's like a final mission, and then I think the game ends as a whole, and then there's another war.

822
00:39:41,709 --> 00:39:42,170
Scott: that happens.

823
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:44,395
Rym: So they're like events, like it can go the other way.

824
00:39:44,456 --> 00:39:49,870
Rym: If the bugs start winning or whatever, like if one of the bad guys wins, then there's emergency missions that pop up.

825
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:54,230
Rym: Like, right now, whoever's online, fucking get in here, and you have to defend a city.

826
00:39:55,070 --> 00:40:00,810
Rym: But those are like, it starts at two o'clock, like right the fuck now, if you don't join, you miss out.

827
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,069
Scott: Yeah, the stuff like that.

828
00:40:02,491 --> 00:40:12,230
Scott: So the only negative in this game that I found is that there's a lot of DLCs that cost money, and those DLCs are not trivial.

829
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:19,210
Scott: For example, there are all-terrain boots that you can buy as a perk, and with real money you can get these.

830
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:21,618
Scott: You can't get them any other way, as far as I know.

831
00:40:21,698 --> 00:40:25,410
Scott: The all-terrain boots, they make it so you just walk in snow and water no problem.

832
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,450
Rym: Oh, that's some bullshit.

833
00:40:26,751 --> 00:40:32,390
Scott: Right, but obviously there's still a perk, so you'd have to get rid of your laser sight, because you only carry one perk on you.

834
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:33,789
Rym: I would give up my laser sight for that.

835
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:43,939
Scott: I'm just saying, for example, so there's certain things that cost money and are just better, but it's all co-op, and you can get really... I mean, I'm perfectly happy with the game.

836
00:40:44,641 --> 00:40:47,309
Scott: It's not like I'm competing, so I don't care if someone's better at shit than me.

837
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:48,035
Rym: Well, that's the thing.

838
00:40:48,055 --> 00:40:48,398
Rym: This is a game.

839
00:40:48,458 --> 00:40:49,427
Rym: If you want to enjoy it...

840
00:40:49,850 --> 00:41:02,647
Scott: It's like this pay-to-win game, and it's like, there is pay-to-win, but it's like, you know, remember when... I always remember Tycho wrote this thing when they talked about Diablo 3, having pay-to-get stuff, and it's like, who are you cheating?

841
00:41:03,108 --> 00:41:03,830
Scott: Satan himself?

842
00:41:05,711 --> 00:41:05,972
Scott: Right?

843
00:41:06,033 --> 00:41:07,801
Scott: Who is the cheated party here?

844
00:41:07,902 --> 00:41:09,650
Scott: The fucking bugs, right?

845
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:15,450
Rym: But for real, I wouldn't recommend playing this game with a bunch of randos, though Scott did, and we'll talk about that.

846
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:23,430
Scott: So after we played, you know, with Just Us 3 and had a good time, even with our very little... You know, we didn't even scratch the surface and had a great time.

847
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:27,787
Rym: Yeah, the amount of yelling was like, there was a lot of like, "Go, go, go, Scott,

848
00:41:27,807 --> 00:41:28,148
Rym: recover!".

849
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:37,230
Scott: I'm gonna play this when I get home after I eat, so I played some single player, and the single player was lame, because if you get the difficulty to any reasonable level, you can't do it on your own.

850
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:37,912
Scott: It's too hard.

851
00:41:37,932 --> 00:41:44,730
Scott: I mean, I'm sure you could get good enough to where you can do it on your own, but godspeed to you if you want to do these things on your own.

852
00:41:45,271 --> 00:41:47,276
Scott: So I said, "Alright, fine, I'll play with random internet

853
00:41:47,316 --> 00:41:47,557
Scott: people.".

854
00:41:47,617 --> 00:41:53,130
Scott: So, this is only a sample size of two, but I played two games with random internet people.

855
00:41:53,230 --> 00:42:01,430
Scott: So the first one, it was the stereotypical people who are speaking in Chinese and have way higher level than me, but they also spoke English.

856
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:06,265
Scott: So I'm playing with these people, and they were really good at the game.

857
00:42:06,366 --> 00:42:07,389
Scott: They knew what to do, right?

858
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:13,149
Scott: You know, and I sort of was able to follow along and contribute and help without really bringing anyone down or anything, right?

859
00:42:13,871 --> 00:42:17,200
Scott: And everyone, they were trying to help.

860
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,643
Scott: Everyone was just positive.

861
00:42:18,663 --> 00:42:21,430
Scott: There was not one shitcock at all, right?

862
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:23,193
Scott: Everything was just A+, let's go.

863
00:42:23,214 --> 00:42:30,328
Scott: The guy has mechs, he brought four mechs with him, and was like, "Four mech stratagems all at once, everyone get a mech, let's

864
00:42:30,368 --> 00:42:30,549
Scott: go.".

865
00:42:31,571 --> 00:42:32,614
Scott: Kind of situation, right?

866
00:42:32,915 --> 00:42:38,109
Scott: And I picked up the recoilless rifle, the guy took the pack, and he's like, "Yeah, I can reload this for you

867
00:42:38,129 --> 00:42:38,270
Scott: here.".

868
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:43,223
Scott: And then he was so good at reloading it for me, I would shoot a big bad guy with it.

869
00:42:43,584 --> 00:42:46,030
Scott: They all knew that I was doing it and got out of the way.

870
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:47,336
Scott: I didn't have to say, "Hey, get out of the way,

871
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:47,697
Scott: guys.".

872
00:42:47,717 --> 00:42:50,369
Scott: They were always out of the way any time a big bad guy showed up.

873
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:57,410
Scott: And then, every time I fired it, the next time I pulled it out to reload it in a quiet time, it would already be reloaded.

874
00:42:57,490 --> 00:42:59,036
Scott: I'm like, "When did he reload this

875
00:42:59,076 --> 00:42:59,337
Scott: thing?".

876
00:42:59,959 --> 00:43:00,240
Scott: Right?

877
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:02,790
Scott: He just reloaded it without me even knowing because he's paying attention.

878
00:43:03,572 --> 00:43:05,077
Scott: So I'm like, "Wow, these guys are really

879
00:43:05,117 --> 00:43:05,338
Scott: good.".

880
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:09,410
Scott: That game eventually ended, played another game with some other people.

881
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,577
Scott: So he was a small bit of trolling.

882
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:15,310
Scott: One guy, all four of his stratagems were mines.

883
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:17,289
Rym: Oh, mine, mine, mine, mines are dangerous.

884
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:20,035
Scott: He put the mines everywhere and we kept dying on them.

885
00:43:20,375 --> 00:43:22,279
Scott: But, we kept reviving ourselves.

886
00:43:22,479 --> 00:43:28,750
Scott: Anytime anyone died, everyone, even the mine guy, would throw the reinforcement thing immediately.

887
00:43:29,051 --> 00:43:37,770
Scott: Anytime I would throw the reinforcement thing and I wasn't the last person alive, all the other remaining living players would also throw their reinforcement thing the same time that I threw it.

888
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:41,310
Scott: So if anyone died, it'd be like, "Reinforce it, reinforce it, reinforce

889
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:41,370
Scott: it.".

890
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:44,866
Rym: That's actually kind of bad news because then you can't reinforce again for 30, 60, or 90 seconds.

891
00:43:46,411 --> 00:43:50,470
Scott: Well, if you're going to play online with people, you need to upgrade your reinforcement thing to the maximum.

892
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:52,297
Rym: Oh yeah, because you've read that Etiquette Guide.

893
00:43:52,317 --> 00:43:52,779
Rym: You know what?

894
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,450
Rym: I'm not going to bow before I kill someone with a lightsaber either.

895
00:43:55,650 --> 00:44:04,970
Scott: Yeah, well, the other thing is once I got to the point where I was able to upgrade my Recoilers Rival to have its own laser sight, I didn't need to use the laser sight perk anymore.

896
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:10,685
Scott: So I was able to instead switch to the priority stratagem perk which makes all my cooldowns faster.

897
00:44:11,648 --> 00:44:12,390
Scott: So that's way good.

898
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:17,620
Rym: But, the game shines most if you find some friends and just play with them.

899
00:44:17,841 --> 00:44:22,070
Rym: Play with your actual friends and ignore all the other people on the internet.

900
00:44:22,251 --> 00:44:25,910
Scott: But I'm telling you, I played with two random internet groups and they were both excellent.

901
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:32,490
Scott: And in that second group, I already knew at this point how the Recoilers Rival worked with the friend helping you reload.

902
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:34,174
Scott: I didn't even say anything.

903
00:44:34,355 --> 00:44:35,499
Scott: I just picked up the gun.

904
00:44:35,921 --> 00:44:38,190
Scott: Someone else without me saying anything picked up the supply pack.

905
00:44:38,871 --> 00:44:42,203
Scott: And in that second game with completely different people, same situation.

906
00:44:42,223 --> 00:44:44,070
Scott: It was just always reloaded whenever I looked at it.

907
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:46,940
Scott: One guy, you can only reload it if I have it out.

908
00:44:47,442 --> 00:44:49,730
Scott: One time I put it away too quickly to get the shotgun out.

909
00:44:50,211 --> 00:44:55,429
Scott: And the guy started stabbing me with his bayonet and I knew what he meant and I pulled the gun out and immediately reloaded it.

910
00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:57,590
Scott: And I was like, alright, these people are like...

911
00:44:57,650 --> 00:45:01,189
Rym: It is interesting how little trolling there is and I think it's because...

912
00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:05,550
Scott: Well, this is only a sample size of two games and there was a guy dropping mines on everyone.

913
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:10,446
Scott: There's also a system of commendations and reporting and someone commended me.

914
00:45:10,466 --> 00:45:11,690
Scott: I was like, oh, okay.

915
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:15,841
Rym: But I did know, I read around like in Reddit and forums.

916
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:18,790
Rym: I was reading the meta, the people talking about this game.

917
00:45:19,273 --> 00:45:22,390
Rym: And it seems like there is very little trolling in general.

918
00:45:22,691 --> 00:45:23,380
Scott: I think it's because it's 100% co-op.

919
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:30,089
Rym: You gain nothing by trolling people and they can all just quit and form a new game without you.

920
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:33,530
Scott: And they can also just report you and not commend you and make a new game.

921
00:45:34,371 --> 00:45:39,766
Scott: The guy who dropped mines everywhere, after the fourth time he did it in a silly way.

922
00:45:39,826 --> 00:45:41,370
Scott: that wasn't helpful, he got kicked.

923
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:42,850
Scott: And it was like, alright.

924
00:45:43,934 --> 00:45:46,870
Rym: But seriously, buy this game if you want a game like this.

925
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,057
Scott: Or wait for a Steam sale.

926
00:45:48,077 --> 00:45:49,103
Scott: I don't think it's going anywhere.

927
00:45:49,365 --> 00:45:50,210
Scott: Magic is still around.

928
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:53,725
Rym: But because of the nature of it, it is kind of repetitive.

929
00:45:53,745 --> 00:45:54,810
Rym: You're going to play it out.

930
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:59,350
Scott: I'm telling you, it's repetitive because it's deep and there's a lot of stuff to see.

931
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:03,950
Scott: But you see very little new stuff over time so you have to keep playing.

932
00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:06,428
Scott: And every mission you'll see a little bit of new stuff.

933
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:09,190
Rym: But eventually you're going to see most of the stuff?

934
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:10,970
Scott: It's a lot of stuff that comes in in a trickle.

935
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:14,850
Rym: People are saying 40 to 60 hours is about all it's worth if you play hard.

936
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:15,809
Scott: Yeah, that's about right.

937
00:46:16,613 --> 00:46:17,541
Scott: And 20 bucks for that?

938
00:46:17,561 --> 00:46:18,470
Scott: You don't need to wait for the Steam sale.

939
00:46:18,530 --> 00:46:22,069
Rym: That's why I say it might be worth buying because we're in it right now.

940
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:25,890
Rym: And if you all get into it at the same time, it's going to be way more fun.

941
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:29,709
Rym: Because I'll totally play it with you guys because it is super fun.

942
00:46:31,051 --> 00:46:36,130
Rym: And I can name many of our personal friends who will be specifically into this game.

943
00:46:36,873 --> 00:46:39,970
Scott: And if there is a Steam sale for this, oh man, that is totally worth it.

944
00:46:40,892 --> 00:46:43,470
Scott: So yeah, there's DLCs which is bullshit, but it's pay to win.

945
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:44,519
Scott: But who are you cheating?

946
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:45,005
Scott: The bugs?

947
00:46:45,790 --> 00:46:50,510
Rym: However, if you join my game and you bought some of that DLC, not going to be a fan.

948
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:51,059
Scott: Why not?

949
00:46:52,711 --> 00:46:58,670
Rym: I feel like those missions with the water would have been a little bit easy if I could just walk over the water.

950
00:46:59,112 --> 00:47:01,030
Scott: That's just one example of a DLC, right?

951
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:03,990
Rym: If they're all that equivalent power, that's a little bit much.

952
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:05,830
Scott: I don't know, but let's say I bought a stratagem.

953
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:08,568
Scott: I could drop it and you can use it even though I bought it.

954
00:47:08,811 --> 00:47:09,410
Scott: Yeah, right?

955
00:47:09,811 --> 00:47:12,290
Scott: There's also a lot of the DLCs are cosmetic, right?

956
00:47:12,350 --> 00:47:16,650
Scott: But I mean, yeah, it's bullshit because it's $40 to get the mega DLC pack plus the game.

957
00:47:16,911 --> 00:47:18,345
Scott: It's $20 to get the game with no DLCs.

958
00:47:20,111 --> 00:47:27,319
Scott: If there is, however, one day, if they had a deal like $10 to get every DLC to finish off, I'd be like, "Oh, maybe.

959
00:47:27,641 --> 00:47:28,709
Scott: See how much I'm still playing

960
00:47:28,729 --> 00:47:28,770
Scott: it.".

961
00:47:29,912 --> 00:47:32,190
Scott: Because it would just add so much more freshness to the game.

962
00:47:32,571 --> 00:47:35,662
Scott: Every time you mix up, you can get more gameplay out of it.

963
00:47:35,722 --> 00:47:37,710
Scott: if you mix up which things you're using.

964
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:50,370
Scott: If I move away from my recoilless rifle strategy and decide I'm going to play more jump boots and laser cannon strategy, suddenly it's like a different game because you play so differently.

965
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:53,486
Scott: Play this game with us.

966
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:53,965
Rym: Yeah.

967
00:48:00,171 --> 00:48:02,310
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

968
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:07,430
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

969
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:12,830
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

970
00:48:13,112 --> 00:48:15,770
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

971
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:20,510
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

972

Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

973
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:28,290
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

974
00:48:28,590 --> 00:48:31,470
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

975
00:48:51,131 --> 00:49:35,290
Rym: And the Patrons for this episode of GeekNights in order of the amount of money they give us are Nicholas Brando, Rebecca Dunn, John R. Knobs II, Amanda Duchette, James David White, Christian Koontz, Jess, Sam Cordery, Mechanical Mind, William Eisenrose, You expected the next name to be yours, but it was me, Dio, Clinton Walton, MyStady.com, Phil Ulrich, Renee from New Zealand, Robert Lee, Ryan Perrin, Drew Openlander, Rare Lavelle, Brian Cedroni, Rochelle Montanona, Finn Eric Solvarod, Rochelle Montanona again, Kinetic Man, Aaron Cerise, Chris Midkiff, Chris Knox, he was a dark and stormy night, Daniel Redman, Chris Haddad, Doug Schneider, Sean Klein, Chris Reimer, and Thomas Hahn.

976
00:49:36,712 --> 00:49:39,724
Rym: I was tripped up by the two Rochelle Montanonas in there.

977
00:49:39,784 --> 00:49:41,210
Rym: That caused me a moment of delay.

978
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:45,970
Rym: Also, I'm speaking to you very close to the microphone in a perhaps smooth radio voice.

979
00:49:46,732 --> 00:49:54,250
Rym: As you probably saw, the Utena episode is finally up, and we actually have two recorded, so I'm working on the editing of the second one already.

980
00:49:54,730 --> 00:50:00,910
Rym: But that won't go up until I get the two panels we have left, possibly three from PAX South that have to get on the channel.

981
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:09,570
Rym: However, everything will be on hold until next week, because we are leaving for MAGFest early Thursday morning, where as you saw, we have six panels.

982
00:50:09,991 --> 00:50:18,550
Rym: So, if you are listening to this still, the post-credits stinger, the Patreon extra content, then be sure to come by and say hi at MAGFest.

983
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:24,690
Rym: We're not joking, we're going to be playing DDR at like three or four in the morning at least one night, and it's going to be amazing.

984
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:28,450
Rym: And now I leave you with something kinda weird.

985
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:38,930
Scott: Good shit, good shit, that's some good shit right there, right there, if I do say so myself, I say so, that's what I'm talking about, right there, right there, right there.

986
00:50:39,656 --> 00:50:40,241
Rym: Woo!

987
00:50:40,383 --> 00:50:41,069
Rym: Good shit!
