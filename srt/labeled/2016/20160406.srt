1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,318
Rym: It's Wednesday, April 6th, 2016.

2
00:00:10,318 --> 00:00:10,479
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,631 --> 00:00:14,846
Scott: I am the Scott.

4
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,816
Rym: And this is The GeekNights.

5
00:00:16,876 --> 00:00:20,550
Rym: Tonight we're talking about the Phoenix Wright anime, Ace Attorney.

6
00:00:22,571 --> 00:00:23,609
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:31,260
Rym: So, uh, I do not like people who vape or vape pens or any of that crap.

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,100
Rym: Like, I'm glad you're smoking that instead of a cigarette, but I still don't want you smoking it around me.

9
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,142
Scott: I still don't want you smoking.

10
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:44,280
Scott: I mean, I don't want you smoking anything because, I mean, perhaps it may be less poison than tobacco.

11
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:44,621
Rym: Oh, you know what?

12
00:00:44,662 --> 00:00:45,264
Rym: I don't even care.

13
00:00:45,365 --> 00:00:47,414
Rym: It smells just as bad as cigarettes.

14
00:00:47,434 --> 00:00:48,840
Rym: It just takes longer to build up.

15
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:53,520
Scott: I also don't want anyone poisoning themselves to any degree of poisoning.

16
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:02,700
Scott: And, but, the one thing I am thankful for is that people who vape, people who smoke, it's like they're trying to let it go away and smoke.

17
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,819
Scott: At least that they're polite, right?

18
00:01:04,108 --> 00:01:04,196
Scott: Yup.

19
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:09,340
Scott: But people who vape, like, they seem to, like, want to show off that they vape, so it's sort of...

20
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:15,200
Rym: I've only seen that at conventions and bars where, like, basically the shitlords who used to pick up girls by, like, "Hey, you wanna have a

21
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:15,320
Rym: smoke?".

22
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:22,420
Scott: Well, I think it's also partially because vaping is a newer thing, so it stands out just on its own even if you're not trying to make it stand out.

23
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:28,500
Scott: So, it's actually, whereas, like, someone smoking a cigarette could be more inconspicuous just because it's more common.

24
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:41,960
Rym: True, but in both cases, I've found that while there are people in the world who are not annoying and/or shitlords who smoke or vape, it's a pretty good, like, easy filter of which humans to talk to at any given event.

25
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:48,856
Scott: But that's what I'm saying, is that vaping at least is beneficial in that it is, like, "Well, there's a person that is a bad person.

26
00:01:49,277 --> 00:01:50,078
Scott: I see him from a mile

27
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:50,339
Scott: away.".

28
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:55,620
Rym: So, anyway, I got a coworker who vapes, but, you know, he doesn't do it in the office because, of course, everyone complained.

29
00:01:56,524 --> 00:01:57,560
Scott: He tried to do it in the office?

30
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,259
Rym: Yeah, he just did it.

31
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,660
Rym: He wasn't immediately fired?

32
00:02:00,241 --> 00:02:02,059
Rym: No, HR was like, "No, you can't do that," and that was the end of that.

33
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,631
Scott: Well, it wasn't HR, like, "You're fired.

34
00:02:03,692 --> 00:02:04,176
Scott: Don't come back

35
00:02:04,277 --> 00:02:04,418
Scott: ever.".

36
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:10,419
Rym: But, I know he vapes in the bathroom because it smells like vape juice in there, and that's the building's responsibility.

37
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:18,300
Rym: So, a couple days ago, there's a no smoking sign because there's already, like, people smoke in every nook and cranny of this giant building.

38
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,538
Scott: No, but not in my building.

39
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:26,620
Scott: Yeah, well, this building is a multi-- I mean, and that's not a fair thing to say because the building I'm in now only has two tenants, one of which is us.

40
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,320
Scott: Yeah, the same multi-tenant building.

41
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,100
Scott: The building I was in previously had a bunch of tenants, didn't have all these empty floors.

42
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,700
Scott: So, Scott, this building has-- There was no smoking in that building.

43
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,554
Rym: One, this is a giant building.

44
00:02:36,635 --> 00:02:37,200
Scott: It's really big.

45
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:37,878
Scott: How many floors?

46
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,301
Rym: Like, 30?

47
00:02:39,301 --> 00:02:41,320
Scott: Okay, that's twice as big as the buildings I'm in.

48
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,340
Rym: Yeah, I mean, we're on the 16th floor, so I have to use the local elevator.

49
00:02:45,103 --> 00:02:46,219
Scott: We're on the 8th and 9th floors.

50
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:50,640
Scott: Which sucks because some, like-- We're on the 8th and 9th floors, but there's only-- the 11th floor is the penthouse.

51
00:02:50,780 --> 00:03:00,356
Rym: Some kind of media startup that they look and act like College Humor or Cracked or one of those kinds of places, but they took over, like, the entire 13th floor and a bunch of, like, the 17th and 19th floors.

52
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:07,378
Rym: So now, when I'm trying to use the elevator, it'll come to my floor already full of these, like, late 20s--.

53
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:18,340
Rym: Basically, they look like me, but they're all working for a thing that sounds like and acts like College Humor, going between all these floors, getting in my way as the elevators fall.

54
00:03:19,503 --> 00:03:23,656
Rym: And they have the most vapid conversations possible, but I won't complain about that because that makes me an old man.

55
00:03:23,697 --> 00:03:24,040
Rym: I don't care.

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,940
Rym: But they do have really vapid conversations, but I digress.

57
00:03:28,801 --> 00:03:31,000
Rym: There's stairways all over, connecting all the floors and everything.

58
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:31,980
Scott: Which you use instead.

59
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:32,521
Rym: I do.

60
00:03:32,601 --> 00:03:39,860
Rym: Well, I stopped using the stairways because they are so full of cigarette butts and ashes and, like, shitheads actually smoking in there.

61
00:03:40,422 --> 00:03:50,882
Scott: And the building, like-- The stairwells in my buildings that I've been in, the previous one and the current one, have been completely empty except for the people who are basically fit enough or really want to use the stairs because-- I want

62
00:03:50,902 --> 00:03:52,860
Rym: to use the stairs to go up, but everything's locked, so I can't.

63
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,880
Rym: I can only use them to go down.

64
00:03:53,982 --> 00:03:55,139
Scott: We can use them to go every which way.

65
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:55,609
Scott: Yeah.

66
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,819
Rym: It's about the bigger a building and the more tenants there are, the less access you actually have to the building.

67
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:07,179
Rym: So earlier this week, there's a no smoking sign in the bathroom, because there's no smoking sign fucking everywhere in this building, because they know it's a problem.

68
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,937
Rym: A paper sign appeared under that that was like, "No electronic cigarettes in the

69
00:04:12,977 --> 00:04:13,479
Rym: bathroom.".

70
00:04:14,563 --> 00:04:15,757
Rym: And I was like, "Huh, that's

71
00:04:15,778 --> 00:04:15,980
Rym: funny.".

72
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:19,099
Rym: The next day, someone had ripped that sign down.

73
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:20,999
Rym: I wonder who ripped it down.

74
00:04:21,402 --> 00:04:27,920
Rym: So I await with glee the passive aggressive war that's going to be waged on my floor of this building.

75
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:38,099
Scott: You just fire this employee and, I mean, if I owned a building and someone was breaking the no smoking in my building rule and it's my building, I would just call the cops on them.

76
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,620
Rym: So actually, the cops literally do not care about that.

77
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,639
Rym: They won't even come.

78
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,139
Rym: I mean, I can-- Scott, did you see the cops-- Fine, okay, fine.

79
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,120
Rym: In parks, right?

80
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,639
Rym: It's illegal to smoke in parks in New York.

81
00:04:50,365 --> 00:04:52,519
Rym: I looked up how many citations they've written for that.

82
00:04:53,405 --> 00:04:53,778
Rym: Like four?

83
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,079
Rym: And they only write them for black people.

84
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,060
Scott: See, here's your mistake.

85
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:02,840
Scott: Is that you're not calling the cops because you want them to arrest someone for smoking.

86
00:05:03,142 --> 00:05:04,000
Scott: They don't give a shit about that.

87
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,211
Rym: Well, no, it's like a $50 ticket or whatever.

88
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:06,640
Scott: That's right.

89
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,380
Scott: You're calling the cops for these two other reasons.

90
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:16,000
Scott: Number one, if the person who's smoking in your building is not a tenant, you're calling from them for trespassing, which you can actually get some attention on, right?

91
00:05:16,301 --> 00:05:19,360
Rym: No, because there's public businesses on various floors of this building.

92
00:05:20,802 --> 00:05:23,400
Scott: Oh, well, you can still get them for something.

93
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:23,798
Scott: I don't know.

94
00:05:24,341 --> 00:05:29,020
Rym: If I go into a Walmart and start smoking-- If you go to Walmart and start vaping, no one gives a shit.

95
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,260
Rym: And if an employee tells you to stop and you don't, one, I doubt they'll call the police.

96
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,860
Rym: And two, if they do, the police will probably just hang up on them.

97
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,660
Scott: All right, so you know what?

98
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,620
Scott: Okay, so here's what we do, right?

99
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,138
Scott: Number one, the building's 30 floors.

100
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,040
Scott: Give or take.

101
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,420
Scott: Private security can take care of the people.

102
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:47,560
Rym: I'm not hiring private security for my own part of a floor of a building.

103
00:05:47,721 --> 00:05:53,540
Scott: At least in your case, at least in your case, this person is a tenant in the building, or an employee of a tenant in the building.

104
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:59,039
Rym: Now, the other people think-- The building can come after-- Building gives zero fucks.

105
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,360
Scott: You as the tenant.

106
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,660
Scott: Well, I think building gives enough fucks to put a sign up.

107
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:10,800
Rym: Well, yeah, probably because someone complained, because it's not just our employee who I know is vaping in the bathroom, because the people who go-- Also, why don't you fire this employee?

108
00:06:11,683 --> 00:06:13,439
Rym: I'm not in charge of any of that crap, and I don't really care.

109
00:06:13,663 --> 00:06:14,058
Scott: Just fire him.

110
00:06:14,869 --> 00:06:15,640
Rym: I run my own division.

111
00:06:15,902 --> 00:06:18,480
Rym: I do not care about what anyone else does.

112
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:23,220
Rym: Remember, Scott, it's not like I work in a company with people who know or are into the things I'm into.

113
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,200
Rym: It's not like it's my video game company.

114
00:06:26,582 --> 00:06:33,900
Rym: If I wanted to fire everyone I've ever worked with who annoyed me-- I mean, there's no one in my building I would fire.

115
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,200
Rym: Well, I mean, my old company was a bunch of stock market people.

116
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,500
Rym: Most of them were intolerable to deal with.

117
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,039
Rym: Most of the people in my industry are intolerant.

118
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,020
Scott: Stop working in that industry.

119
00:06:43,241 --> 00:06:44,317
Rym: But that's where all the money is.

120
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:45,380
Scott: I got money.

121
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,740
Rym: I got more money, and I want to keep it that way for now.

122
00:06:47,961 --> 00:06:48,639
Scott: I got plenty of money.

123
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,680
Scott: I don't need money more.

124
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,740
Rym: You don't want more money?

125
00:06:51,022 --> 00:06:51,719
Scott: What am I going to do with it?

126
00:06:52,263 --> 00:06:52,980
Rym: Well, I don't know.

127
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,880
Rym: Go to the beach eventually?

128
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,880
Scott: It has to be a lot more money to make a difference.

129
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,020
Rym: It was a little more money.

130
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,880
Rym: You could just go see the castles whenever you wanted.

131
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,580
Scott: No, money's not the thing keeping me from seeing the castles.

132
00:07:03,003 --> 00:07:05,590
Rym: If you had a reasonable more money, you could just say like, "Yeah, I'm taking a

133
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,020
Rym: sabbatical.".

134
00:07:07,181 --> 00:07:09,120
Scott: Then what do I do when I get back from the sabbatical?

135
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:09,820
Rym: Go back to work.

136
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,538
Rym: Sabbatical just means unpaid time off.

137
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,377
Scott: They're going to let me?

138
00:07:12,881 --> 00:07:14,420
Rym: Are you that important to the organization?

139
00:07:15,123 --> 00:07:15,574
Scott: This is great.

140
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,397
Scott: There you go.

141
00:07:16,683 --> 00:07:17,500
Scott: It doesn't happen anyway.

142
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:22,710
Rym: So have you got any opening statements here?

143
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:23,354
Scott: Oh.

144
00:07:24,431 --> 00:07:27,490
Rym: I was just trying to segue you into your inane story about your life.

145
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,646
Rym: Because as you know, the format of GeekNights is we have the opening bit.

146
00:07:30,807 --> 00:07:31,390
Rym: that's unrelated.

147
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:35,190
Scott: I'm going to talk about something that absolutely nobody cares about.

148
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:38,289
Rym: You think anyone cares about me watching like-.

149
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,989
Scott: They care about this even less.

150
00:07:40,331 --> 00:07:43,850
Rym: A slap fight between someone who put up a no vaping sign and someone who tore it down.

151
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,170
Scott: People who care the least about.

152
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:48,410
Scott: But I have absolutely no human beings to discuss this with.

153
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:50,269
Scott: So I'm going to just say it on the show because I want to.

154
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:51,030
Rym: All right, all right.

155
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,510
Rym: I'm really excited to see how I feel about this.

156
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,309
Scott: So I was watching some garbage Korean TV.

157
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:55,330
Rym: All right.

158
00:07:55,712 --> 00:07:56,588
Scott: Which I watch a lot of.

159
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:00,490
Scott: And there was this show that was on recently called Produce 101.

160
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:03,630
Scott: And this is the most garbage show that has ever existed.

161
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,290
Rym: Is that the old ladies rapping?

162
00:08:04,611 --> 00:08:06,349
Scott: No, that's a way cooler show.

163
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:06,948
Scott: All right.

164
00:08:07,471 --> 00:08:10,230
Scott: So this is a show on Mnet.

165
00:08:10,331 --> 00:08:13,790
Scott: And Mnet is sort of like MTV where it's supposed to be about music.

166
00:08:14,011 --> 00:08:14,238
Scott: And it is.

167
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,290
Scott: But it's mostly like reality shows.

168
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,290
Rym: But all the reality shows- So it's just like MTV.

169
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:22,750
Scott: But all the reality shows, at least on Mnet, are music related.

170
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,880
Scott: They're not like completely.

171
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,750
Scott: just reality shows have nothing to do with music.

172
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:29,510
Scott: They're actually music related like competition shows usually.

173
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:33,630
Scott: Like for example, they have a show Show Me The Money, which is like a rap competition show.

174
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:35,350
Scott: And that grandma show is on a different channel.

175
00:08:35,671 --> 00:08:37,750
Scott: It's basically grandma show me the money, right?

176
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,630
Rym: I'd watch grandma show me the money.

177
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,116
Scott: That's on JTBC.

178
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,049
Scott: It's a different channel.

179
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:47,050
Scott: But Show Me The Money is actually, you know, it's like the show is just like every other Mnet show.

180
00:08:48,553 --> 00:08:50,470
Scott: Except there's good music comes out of these things.

181
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:53,990
Scott: If you go to Spotify, go on YouTube and search for turtle ship.

182
00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:56,410
Scott: That is like the best song from Show Me The Money.

183
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:57,048
Scott: It's so good.

184
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:02,530
Scott: Anyway, so that Produce 101 was pretty much just like Show Me The Money, a competition music show.

185
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,639
Scott: Except what it was is 101 trainees, right?

186
00:09:08,972 --> 00:09:11,970
Scott: Which is like teenage girls between the ages.

187
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:19,389
Scott: Well, some of them weren't teenage, but, you know, teenage girls competing in this elimination show over the course of 11 episodes.

188
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,089
Rym: You showed me some of this.

189
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,570
Scott: Yeah, it's the creepiest thing ever.

190
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:24,330
Rym: It's not the creepiest thing ever.

191
00:09:25,091 --> 00:09:31,430
Scott: They're cutting them down to a group of 11 that will form a temporary idol group for one year.

192
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,324
Scott: Because I guess the they're from all like small, some not all.

193
00:09:35,344 --> 00:09:43,169
Scott: they're from small agencies, but most of them it's like, for example, the one girl who's like the best, even though she's only 15, she's like the awesomest.

194
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:48,870
Scott: She actually lost on another competition show, right?

195
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:52,910
Scott: And now that's why it was so easy for her to like, she's already popular, right?

196
00:09:53,212 --> 00:09:54,249
Scott: So she coming into this show.

197
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,530
Rym: I feel like that's cheating, but anyway.

198
00:09:56,532 --> 00:09:58,730
Scott: Maybe, but she's the awesomest, so whatever.

199
00:10:00,431 --> 00:10:09,629
Scott: So the big drama here, right, is that you know how at the beginning of these shows, like the American idols and whatever, like first episode, first couple episodes, they introduce everybody.

200
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:12,030
Scott: There's always those examples they show.

201
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,530
Scott: They always show you the best and the worst.

202
00:10:13,611 --> 00:10:15,489
Scott: They don't show you all the average, boring people, right?

203
00:10:15,851 --> 00:10:20,909
Scott: They show you the best people and they show you the garbage people who are like, aha, look, this person can't even sing and dance.

204
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:24,870
Rym: I'm awaiting your very specific complaint about some trashy TV you watch from Korea.

205
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:25,669
Scott: Yeah, that's right.

206
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,230
Scott: They always show those people who are just garbage, right?

207
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:31,830
Scott: As the example of like, aha, look at this funny person, right?

208
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,328
Scott: We just like the American Idol, whatever.

209
00:10:34,131 --> 00:10:37,429
Scott: We have them here for episode one entertainment value, but then they're gonna go away.

210
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:42,209
Rym: Like the guy who comes out and I'm gonna do a like, ninja magic trick and then he just falls over and breaks his nose at the end.

211
00:10:42,612 --> 00:10:43,370
Scott: Exactly, right?

212
00:10:43,952 --> 00:10:51,650
Scott: So they had a girl who was like, Japanese and couldn't sing or dance and like, thought too much of herself who was like, comic relief.

213
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:56,966
Scott: They had a girl who was like, ridiculously incredible singer, but then they asked her to dance and she was like, um.

214
00:10:58,311 --> 00:11:00,010
Scott: And they were like, you can't dance.

215
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:00,970
Scott: You know, this is an idol group.

216
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,010
Scott: You're gonna have to dance, right?

217
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:02,726
Scott: And she's like, yeah.

218
00:11:03,173 --> 00:11:04,630
Scott: But they're like, you know you're the best singer, right?

219
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,489
Scott: Why don't you just become a solo singer and leave the show?

220
00:11:07,812 --> 00:11:11,930
Scott: And then they had this girl where it's like, they were like, isn't your agency like, acting?

221
00:11:12,451 --> 00:11:13,890
Scott: She's like, an acting agency?

222
00:11:13,951 --> 00:11:14,549
Scott: And she's like, yeah.

223
00:11:15,311 --> 00:11:17,850
Scott: They're like, so do you know how to sing or dance at all?

224
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:19,570
Scott: And she's like, I know acting.

225
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:21,028
Scott: They're like, why are you here?

226
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,870
Scott: And you didn't really get a clear answer on that, right?

227
00:11:23,992 --> 00:11:25,168
Rym: So obviously it was set up.

228
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:25,786
Scott: Right.

229
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:28,070
Scott: So all these things were set up, right?

230
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:28,709
Scott: All these people.

231
00:11:29,811 --> 00:11:32,209
Scott: The mistake this show made, right?

232
00:11:33,012 --> 00:11:34,088
Scott: They didn't rig it.

233
00:11:34,871 --> 00:11:35,450
Scott: It was a hundred.

234
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:39,129
Scott: It was a hundred percent voting of the audience.

235
00:11:41,437 --> 00:11:42,029
Scott: For real.

236
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:42,848
Scott: For real.

237
00:11:43,216 --> 00:11:43,850
Scott: Not kidding.

238
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,050
Scott: Not pretending, right?

239
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:49,310
Scott: Other shows would like all these other competition shows have like judges and things like, right?

240
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:50,475
Scott: That would cut.

241
00:11:50,516 --> 00:11:53,150
Scott: or they do like percentages like, oh, fan vote counts.

242
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:55,110
Scott: 20% judges vote counts.

243
00:11:55,834 --> 00:11:57,770
Rym: They got super delegates like the Democrats.

244
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:02,170
Scott: This was a hundred percent pure democracy with various voting systems.

245
00:12:02,391 --> 00:12:04,950
Rym: Did someone really dumb and bad get voted on just because?

246
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:10,310
Scott: The actress girl, basically after like the first couple episodes, she got a whole bunch of votes.

247
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:13,690
Scott: So then she stayed on the show after the first cut.

248
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:17,790
Scott: And then they started showing her more because she had, you know, fans, I guess.

249
00:12:18,831 --> 00:12:24,189
Scott: And then, but every time they showed her, it's like, you could tell they were trying to show that this girl could not sing or dance.

250
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:30,489
Scott: And then they showed even scenes like the girl who like was in second place and was like so good was helping her out and being nice.

251
00:12:30,913 --> 00:12:32,970
Scott: Trying to make that girl look good and the other one look bad.

252
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,630
Rym: That's like the vote for what to name that British ship.

253
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:38,130
Rym: And the winning vote from the public was like Bodie McBeth face.

254
00:12:38,931 --> 00:12:42,930
Scott: And they tried to like show that like she was crying because she couldn't do anything.

255
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:43,350
Scott: Right.

256
00:12:43,992 --> 00:12:49,810
Scott: And then somehow at the very end of the show, like they unceremoniously were like, all right, you won.

257
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:50,765
Scott: You're like fourth place.

258
00:12:53,075 --> 00:12:53,670
Rym: That's awesome.

259
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,506
Rym: No, it's not 100% awesome.

260
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:56,870
Rym: That is brilliant.

261
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,030
Scott: You think it's awesome.

262
00:12:58,131 --> 00:12:59,309
Scott: But now this group.

263
00:12:59,558 --> 00:12:59,790
Scott: Right.

264
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:03,930
Scott: It's like, imagine if I, if you had to go work with 10 other people at a job.

265
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:04,250
Scott: Right.

266
00:13:04,612 --> 00:13:07,010
Scott: And they were voting on, uh, you know, programmers.

267
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:07,910
Scott: Right.

268
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:10,790
Scott: And they voted for the one person who obviously couldn't program.

269
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:13,009
Scott: But now that person is on your team and you have to deal with them.

270
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:17,849
Rym: You would have to use what attributes they have to make something amazing happen.

271
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:26,029
Scott: So there's like this huge internet, like hate storm of like, oh my God, this girl, why is she, she's going to ruin everything.

272
00:13:27,412 --> 00:13:33,310
Scott: So there, there's some internet drama from a corner of the world that I know not, not even one listener has ever seen.

273
00:13:33,816 --> 00:13:34,789
Scott: So I can't imagine.

274
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:35,670
Scott: Right.

275
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:36,448
Scott: Let me bring it back.

276
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:37,150
Scott: Right.

277
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:40,569
Scott: The super thing, the super narrow thing that you've never even heard of.

278
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:41,570
Scott: Right.

279
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:49,730
Scott: As this kind of drama, imagine how many dramas like that are in the world simultaneously every day and all the corners of all the geekery.

280
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,288
Rym: It's a beautiful thing to see.

281
00:13:52,173 --> 00:13:53,929
Rym: It's a beautiful thing to see.

282
00:13:54,494 --> 00:13:56,108
Scott: If you could somehow add all those up.

283
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:59,549
Scott: Or like get a picture of all of them at once.

284
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:04,970
Scott: Like the drama map of, you know, April 6, 2016.

285
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:05,038
Rym: Huh?

286
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:12,390
Rym: I feel like you could make a social media account or website that collected all these stories and provided context.

287
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,930
Rym: Like, uh, call it drama bomb.com.

288
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:15,610
Rym: What if that exists?

289
00:14:15,893 --> 00:14:16,789
Scott: I'll just call it now.

290
00:14:16,971 --> 00:14:18,090
Scott: Isn't it just called a newspaper?

291
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,248
Rym: I guess it'd be encyclopedia dramatica.

292
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:21,590
Scott: Isn't it just a newspaper?

293
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,769
Rym: Drama bomb.com does not exist.

294
00:14:24,217 --> 00:14:24,448
Scott: All right.

295
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:24,990
Scott: Buy it then.

296
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,269
Rym: I think I will wait.

297
00:14:28,138 --> 00:14:28,286
Rym: Anyway.

298
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,449
Rym: Now it turned into a blank page.

299
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:29,827
Rym: All right.

300
00:14:30,212 --> 00:14:30,746
Rym: I'll get into that.

301
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:31,870
Scott: Anyway.

302
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:32,201
Scott: Yeah.

303
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,768
Scott: There's no one to talk about that with on earth.

304
00:14:34,231 --> 00:14:38,970
Rym: So we were two weeks ago at anime Boston and then I was a Zenkai con and Scott was not.

305
00:14:39,413 --> 00:14:40,790
Scott: And I don't have a, I made the right move.

306
00:14:40,994 --> 00:14:41,310
Scott: Didn't I?

307
00:14:41,616 --> 00:14:42,170
Rym: I had a good time.

308
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:49,269
Rym: In fact, the only thing that marred my Zenkai con at all, because actually Lancaster's way more rocking than it was last year.

309
00:14:49,952 --> 00:15:08,529
Rym: The only thing that marred it was that my Amtrak train fucking hit some dude on the tracks on the way home, but he lived, but you know, I learned a lot about Amtrak nonsense, but anyway, uh, so at Zenkai con, one of the panels I did was like how to run an anime club and I did it with the other Scott Scott Johnson who ran the RIT anime club with me.

310
00:15:09,231 --> 00:15:15,129
Rym: We also did a how to run an anime club panel at anime Boston between both of them.

311
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,870
Scott: They were well attended for some reason.

312
00:15:18,295 --> 00:15:20,489
Rym: And I actually took a bunch of questions as Zenkai con too.

313
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,189
Rym: And you know what?

314
00:15:21,912 --> 00:15:23,286
Rym: These kids know what's up.

315
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:35,110
Rym: Anime clubs are having this huge resurgence, but none of these kids at either con have any idea of why they want to have an anime club.

316
00:15:36,251 --> 00:15:55,536
Rym: Like they don't know why they just seem to assume that they need, they need to have an anime club or that they should have an anime club, but they couldn't, none of them, no could articulate why they wanted to run an anime club except one kid who was like, I kind of just want to like be popular and like be the gatekeeper of animate all my friends and to everyone else in the area

317
00:15:55,877 --> 00:15:56,660
Scott: gatekeeper

318
00:15:57,082 --> 00:16:03,386
Rym: or not say it in so many words, but he, he was, he wanted to be that he wanted to be the guy, the, the, there's

319
00:16:03,406 --> 00:16:07,750
Scott: a difference between the guy who stands at the front of the granary with a spear and says no.

320
00:16:08,091 --> 00:16:13,309
Scott: And the Jesus guy who goes around handing out fishes, you want to be the second, the Jesus guy, you don't want to be the guy with the spear.

321
00:16:13,551 --> 00:16:21,790
Rym: But with a fandoms, there's often the Jesus guy who's going around handing out just one kind of fish because that's the kind of fish he wants everyone to be into.

322
00:16:21,991 --> 00:16:23,129
Scott: It's Lord of the flies, man.

323
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:23,610
Scott: Yeah.

324
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:26,230
Scott: You read this book when you were the age to run an anime club.

325
00:16:27,191 --> 00:16:38,301
Rym: And I realized between doing these two panels, especially doing the second one, that the only content that actually matters is how to deal with drama and how to deal with that guy.

326
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:49,380
Rym: Like none of the other advice we give actually matters because it all just comes around to guy, all that structure, all the constitution, all that shit only exists to deal with the drama.

327
00:16:49,770 --> 00:17:02,009
Rym: And then that guy, and actually, I think we convinced a few people to make private anime clubs, invite only anime clubs because a lot of people were real uncomfortable with the advice that we were giving.

328
00:17:03,191 --> 00:17:09,250
Rym: And it was just very interesting to see this simultaneous, like widespread desire.

329
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:17,770
Rym: Like these kids want to start anime clubs enough to where they go to a convention and go to a panel on it instead of doing all the other anime con stuff.

330
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:23,030
Rym: And yet they literally cannot articulate why they want to run an anime club.

331
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:27,230
Scott: Most people can't articulate why they do anything that they do or why they want anything they want.

332
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:29,850
Scott: That is a sign of like a higher, you know, thinking.

333
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:31,749
Rym: Now, why do you watch this trashy Korean TV?

334
00:17:32,512 --> 00:17:33,569
Scott: I will tell you exactly why.

335
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:36,649
Rym: I'm really curious, like nothing against it, but why?

336
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:39,050
Scott: I will explain very well why I watch the Korean TV.

337
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:42,350
Scott: When you watch American TV, that is equally trashy, right?

338
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:42,929
Rym: But I don't.

339
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,347
Rym: I watch good American TV.

340
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:44,860
Scott: Sure.

341
00:17:45,351 --> 00:17:50,870
Scott: Anyway, the American trashy TV has this sort of cynical outlook, right?

342
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:55,770
Scott: And it also has this sort of feeling like we can't show the truth, right?

343
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:57,090
Scott: It's dishonest, right?

344
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:02,649
Scott: It's super highly like overproduced and they hide the fact that it's produced in fake, right?

345
00:18:03,071 --> 00:18:08,918
Scott: So not only it's dishonest and it also is like, you know, viewing the world in a dim light, right?

346
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:16,150
Scott: And it's sort of like when you see like someone brightly shining on, say, American Idol, it's like, oh my God, finally we found one good person.

347
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,750
Scott: Like the whole world is shit, but we found someone good, right?

348
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:25,290
Scott: The Korean TV is basically the same exact formula, except for those two things, right?

349
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:31,150
Scott: Number one, they show they basically are completely honest that this is just fucking garbage television, right?

350
00:18:32,394 --> 00:18:39,610
Scott: They show cameramen, they just they break the fourth wall and they talk to the directors and the camera people all the fucking time, right?

351
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:43,230
Scott: They're not lying about the fact that, like, this is so fucking fake.

352
00:18:43,613 --> 00:18:45,389
Scott: Look at us make fake TV for you.

353
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:52,450
Scott: TV people are constantly talking about TV the way the podcasters talk about podcasting all the time, right?

354
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:57,010
Scott: And the outlook is sincere and optimistic, right?

355
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,110
Scott: It's like, look at all these.

356
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,609
Scott: It's not like the world is shit.

357
00:19:01,114 --> 00:19:02,827
Scott: It's like everyone work hard.

358
00:19:03,311 --> 00:19:03,787
Scott: We'll do this.

359
00:19:03,953 --> 00:19:04,330
Scott: Yeah.

360
00:19:04,471 --> 00:19:06,690
Scott: And it's like, you know, it's like feeling good.

361
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,270
Scott: It's like we're dancing and singing.

362
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:08,555
Scott: Woo.

363
00:19:09,697 --> 00:19:09,970
Scott: Right.

364
00:19:10,331 --> 00:19:12,130
Scott: And it's like when someone loses their right.

365
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:14,009
Scott: It's they're not like you suck.

366
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,129
Scott: You lost because you suck.

367
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,989
Scott: They're like, well, you're famous now.

368
00:19:17,091 --> 00:19:18,530
Scott: You'll be able to achieve your dream.

369
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:19,207
Scott: Work hard.

370
00:19:19,582 --> 00:19:19,750
Scott: Right.

371
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:24,289
Scott: It gives a totally different kind of feel when you watch it than when watching the same exact car.

372
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:31,149
Scott: And those feels that you get from watching these shows, if you watch too much of them are dangerously addicting.

373
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:31,807
Scott: So don't start.

374
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:34,149
Rym: All right.

375
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:34,967
Rym: You got any anime news?

376
00:19:35,754 --> 00:19:36,610
Scott: I do have an anime news.

377
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:38,810
Scott: It's sort of not really the big news, but.

378
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:42,550
Rym: Yeah, because my news of I guess anime comes are getting popular again.

379
00:19:42,811 --> 00:19:43,490
Rym: That was news.

380
00:19:43,991 --> 00:19:46,361
Scott: So you might recall a while ago we talked about.

381
00:19:46,702 --> 00:19:53,809
Scott: I talked about how I had canceled the Crunchyroll paying and started at the Hulu paying because there wasn't anything left to watch in Crunchyroll that I want to watch.

382
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:54,430
Rym: It was funny.

383
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:57,590
Rym: We just went in to log into the Crunchyroll account that we just had.

384
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:58,409
Scott: Stop stealing my news.

385
00:19:58,552 --> 00:19:59,869
Rym: Someone else's password for.

386
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:00,340
Rym: Right.

387
00:20:00,911 --> 00:20:03,349
Scott: And they had also stopped paying canceled Crunchyroll.

388
00:20:03,592 --> 00:20:03,680
Scott: Yeah.

389
00:20:04,414 --> 00:20:05,430
Scott: And I paid for Hulu instead.

390
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:07,370
Scott: So I watched a whole bunch of stuff on Hulu.

391
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:07,650
Scott: Right.

392
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:08,630
Rym: Still watching a bunch of stuff.

393
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,850
Scott: There is a bunch of stuff to watch on there still.

394
00:20:11,451 --> 00:20:15,089
Scott: But it's stuff like Sailor Moon where it's like, am I really going to go back to it now?

395
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:15,685
Rym: I don't know.

396
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:16,288
Rym: Scott's Virgin Go Mina.

397
00:20:17,413 --> 00:20:18,569
Scott: Am I really going to go back to it now?

398
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:19,289
Scott: You have to.

399
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:20,750
Scott: Anyway, it's so good.

400
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:24,290
Scott: But this season, there's actually quite a few shows to watch this season.

401
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,430
Scott: Some of them this anime season.

402
00:20:27,558 --> 00:20:27,665
Rym: Yep.

403
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:28,249
Rym: This season.

404
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:30,909
Scott: And some of them are maybe shows.

405
00:20:32,011 --> 00:20:34,250
Scott: Some of them are shows I have to see before I know.

406
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:37,329
Scott: But one of them is Sakamoto Tezuka.

407
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:39,129
Rym: Sakamoto Tezuka.

408
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:40,809
Scott: Which is the best anime show.

409
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,970
Scott: I don't even need to see anything but the trailer to know.

410
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,990
Scott: That is the show of the season.

411
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:49,230
Scott: That is the... I don't know if it'll be One Punch Man good, but it's at least one step under that.

412
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:55,050
Rym: It's just kind of a show where, like, if it's bad, it'll be amusing like a Zai-zan Jotaro.

413
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:57,630
Scott: At worst, it's Zai-zan Jotaro with way better animation.

414
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:58,550
Scott: At worst, right?

415
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:03,070
Scott: It's worth... It can't... A show with that trailer can't be not worth watching.

416
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:08,190
Scott: And apparently every single show this season that I want to watch is on the crunchy roll.

417
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,009
Scott: And I haven't seen these shows on the Hulu yet.

418
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:17,890
Scott: So I'm going to pay for the crunchy roll again and maybe, maybe cancel the Hulu and, you know, do a little switchback for this anime season and then switch for, you know, who knows.

419
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:22,149
Rym: Because I need you to have the Hulu... Well, I guess I need you to be able to watch all this Lupin because I want to review all this Lupin.

420
00:21:23,191 --> 00:21:25,209
Scott: I'm feeling Lupin season coming soon, maybe.

421
00:21:26,094 --> 00:21:28,710
Scott: But I mean, if there's a Sakamoto desu ka, I'm going to watch that first.

422
00:21:31,213 --> 00:21:32,867
Scott: You know, so that's that.

423
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,089
Scott: Oh, yeah.

424
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:38,330
Scott: So Crunchyroll right now has, like, all the shows you want to watch this season.

425
00:21:38,392 --> 00:21:39,030
Scott: That's the news.

426
00:21:39,312 --> 00:21:42,450
Scott: They've been announcing, like, the things that they're streaming, like, every day.

427
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:46,248
Scott: There's, like, another announcement and it's like, "Show you wanted to watch is streaming on...".

428
00:21:46,633 --> 00:21:47,610
Scott: And it's always Crunchyroll.

429
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,449
Scott: It's been Crunchyroll, like, three or four times this week.

430
00:21:49,832 --> 00:21:53,490
Rym: So it's basically Crunchyroll if you want to see the brand new anime.

431
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,888
Rym: Hulu if you want to watch all the rest of anime.

432
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,209
Scott: That you haven't seen already.

433
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:57,545
Scott: Yep.

434
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:58,570
Scott: For some mistake that you made.

435
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:03,350
Rym: And Crunchyroll for free if you want to watch the cool, weird stuff like Yamashibai or folk tales from Japan.

436
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:06,850
Scott: Oh, man, that thumbnail on the new folk tale looked really good.

437
00:22:06,931 --> 00:22:07,368
Rym: Oh, man.

438
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:07,950
Scott: Anyway.

439
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,840
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

440
00:22:16,482 --> 00:22:17,179
Rym: Got a thing of the day?

441
00:22:17,464 --> 00:22:17,676
Scott: I do.

442
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,174
Scott: So there's a store online called Vat19, right?

443
00:22:21,784 --> 00:22:24,180
Scott: And it's a store, it's sort of like Spencer Gifs of the internet.

444
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,080
Scott: They sell all sorts of weird, you know, tchotchkes that do funky stuff, right?

445
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:28,311
Scott: Yeah.

446
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,940
Scott: The front part of the Spencer Gifs, not the Hot Topic back part.

447
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:37,420
Scott: And, you know, if you need something like that, I mean, you can go here, you can go to ThinkGeek.

448
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:43,800
Scott: But Vat19, as their name might imply, specializes in these putties, right?

449
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,780
Scott: That are, like, magical putties that do interesting things.

450
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:53,880
Scott: And not just the things that Silly Putty does, like, absorbing newspaper comic strips and stretching and bouncing, but many other interesting things, right?

451
00:22:54,281 --> 00:22:57,179
Scott: So one putty they have is, like, this liquid glass putty.

452
00:22:57,802 --> 00:23:08,598
Scott: And what happens with it is if you put it in a container, it will fit the form of the container, but also become, over time, ridiculously transparent to the point at which you look at the container and it would look like nothing is in there.

453
00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:09,084
Scott: Ooh.

454
00:23:09,828 --> 00:23:10,020
Scott: Right?

455
00:23:10,302 --> 00:23:10,639
Scott: All right.

456
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:22,180
Scott: But if you grab it and start messing with it, it, like, gets cloudy and sort of looks like a crushed rock almost, but then you let it sit and it kind of, and it basically never runs out of its magic powers and is, like, you know, whatever.

457
00:23:22,384 --> 00:23:22,678
Rym: Oh, man.

458
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,519
Rym: Material science.

459
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:27,656
Scott: And on their website, they have a video of a dude getting into a bathtub full of this stuff.

460
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:28,516
Scott: What?

461
00:23:29,161 --> 00:23:31,900
Rym: I would not trust that that's necessarily safe.

462
00:23:32,281 --> 00:23:38,820
Scott: He forgot he removed his hair in advance, smartly, and did not remove his armpit hair in advance, unsmartly.

463
00:23:42,042 --> 00:23:59,760
Scott: But there's one putty in particular I want to put, so my thing of the day is basically this whole website, all their videos and everything, but the one putty I'm most interested in is one, I'm hoping that I can use this to mystify people who didn't listen right now, is this magical sort of, like, UV sensitive putty, and it comes with, like, a little keychain UV light.

464
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,939
Rym: I have a bunch of little keychain UV lights.

465
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:12,580
Scott: So what you can do with this is it's sensitive to the UV, so you put the putty in, like, a container, and then you can sort of draw on the container with the UV light, like, say, like, draw a smiley face.

466
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:12,707
Scott: Yeah.

467
00:24:13,081 --> 00:24:16,779
Scott: And then open it up and there'll be a smiley face on the putty purple and it's white putty.

468
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,779
Scott: And then it'll fade over time.

469
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,520
Scott: But you could just draw on it again.

470
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,180
Scott: So, like, that's a crazy magic trick.

471
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:27,480
Scott: If you can hide that keychain somehow in your hand with some sleight of hand, and you could be like, all right, play with this putty.

472
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,398
Scott: You see it's just white goop?

473
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,780
Scott: All right, put it in this container.

474
00:24:30,181 --> 00:24:31,479
Scott: Ooh, let's say the magic words.

475
00:24:32,102 --> 00:24:34,300
Scott: Ooh, you know, is this the number you were thinking of?

476
00:24:34,421 --> 00:24:35,516
Rym: Oh, my God, it is.

477
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,460
Rym: You could go one step further and add another element.

478
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:46,479
Rym: So if you take tonic water, just, like, basic tonic water, it will glow, like, it'll look like it's glowing if you shine ultraviolet light on it.

479
00:24:47,243 --> 00:24:47,840
Rym: As long as it's real.

480
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,139
Rym: I have to have, like, an equine in it to do that.

481
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,240
Scott: So splash it on someone's shirt?

482
00:24:50,703 --> 00:24:51,480
Rym: Eh, that will be enough.

483
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,314
Rym: Like, but a glass of it.

484
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:56,879
Rym: Like, if you point it at a glass of it, you'll see, like, this effervescence kind of happening.

485
00:24:57,104 --> 00:24:57,191
Rym: Okay.

486
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:57,794
Rym: It's cool.

487
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:58,336
Scott: All right.

488
00:24:58,981 --> 00:25:12,420
Rym: So my thing is, I don't know if the show is good at all, but not that long ago, I suddenly saw a bunch of recommendations in my YouTube and some other people's YouTubes for that Wander Over Yonder show that didn't get a lot of attention.

489
00:25:12,743 --> 00:25:14,740
Scott: I've heard of something called Wander Over Yonder.

490
00:25:15,021 --> 00:25:17,660
Scott: As had I. I know nothing about it, but I know there's something called that.

491
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,238
Scott: That's all I know.

492
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,920
Rym: So suddenly I see, and I see clips of this show all over my YouTube.

493
00:25:23,062 --> 00:25:23,360
Scott: Was it on TV?

494
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,520
Rym: So here's the deal.

495
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:30,859
Rym: I clicked on one of these, and it was a musical number, like a cabaret-style thing in the show.

496
00:25:31,101 --> 00:25:34,100
Rym: And I was like, all right, because remember, I kind of got into ponies because, oh, they're singing.

497
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:34,600
Rym: There's music.

498
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,580
Scott: Oh, pony season started again, but I haven't watched any.

499
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,718
Rym: Yeah, I'll watch it soon.

500
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,280
Rym: Caught up on Adventure Time, though.

501
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:39,486
Rym: Damn.

502
00:25:40,162 --> 00:25:42,199
Scott: I did, unless there's something newer than what I've seen.

503
00:25:43,323 --> 00:25:44,438
Rym: Damn, still goes.

504
00:25:46,201 --> 00:25:52,340
Rym: So then I click on the related next video, and it's another Wander Over Yonder, and it's also a cabaret-style song.

505
00:25:53,141 --> 00:25:56,240
Rym: And all these clips are songs like that.

506
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,200
Rym: One of them is a straight-up meatloaf homage.

507
00:25:59,785 --> 00:25:59,999
Rym: Okay.

508
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,551
Rym: So I don't know if this show focuses on the music to that degree.

509
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:05,940
Scott: Or should I say Rym's Meat Locker?

510
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:18,318
Rym: But I'm going to give the show a watch based solely on these clips, and the times that I've gotten into a show because YouTube was like, hey, here's a bunch of clips from it.

511
00:26:18,922 --> 00:26:20,540
Rym: I've almost never been led astray.

512
00:26:20,781 --> 00:26:22,000
Scott: That's a pretty good indicator.

513
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,480
Scott: If you like a clip on YouTube, you're going to like the show it came from.

514
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:30,419
Rym: What I'm curious about, though, is why suddenly I saw these all over the place, because the videos have been uploaded relatively recently.

515
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,840
Rym: I wonder, this is a crazy speculation.

516
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:36,079
Scott: They're being uploaded to market the show?

517
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:42,478
Rym: Yeah, because I feel like Teen Titans Go, The Amazing World of Gumball, even My Little Pony, to a degree.

518
00:26:43,261 --> 00:26:50,560
Rym: They didn't hit this certain level of mass appeal, except from people who were kind of in the know, until people were sharing clips from them on YouTube.

519
00:26:51,182 --> 00:26:54,920
Rym: And that's a really low-effort entry point into a show.

520
00:26:55,862 --> 00:26:58,111
Rym: But you have to have self-contained clips.

521
00:26:58,613 --> 00:27:00,339
Rym: that sort of will draw someone in.

522
00:27:00,902 --> 00:27:05,380
Rym: Musical numbers seem to be the primary successful way to do that.

523
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,079
Rym: I've seen it happen a bunch of times.

524
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,965
Rym: I'm curious if this is on purpose, if they dialed back.

525
00:27:11,045 --> 00:27:14,480
Rym: the YouTube copyright claims to let that happen.

526
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:19,825
Scott: Let me just say, if you really like musical numbers, you can watch the show called Produce 101.

527
00:27:19,825 --> 00:27:21,440
Scott: It's nothing but musical numbers.

528
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:27,820
Rym: But seriously, cabaret-style meatloaf homage.

529
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:32,859
Rym: One of these keeps getting stuck in my head, and it's just these two people, this dragon and this eyeball guy.

530
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,720
Scott: I can see this still frame on your screen there.

531
00:27:36,381 --> 00:27:38,580
Rym: Well, Scott, look at this eyeball guy and this dragon.

532
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,357
Scott: But the screenshot you just had before...

533
00:27:40,721 --> 00:27:42,400
Rym: Oh, the sexy dominator woman?

534
00:27:42,901 --> 00:27:47,480
Scott: I mean, just that one still shot gave me a Samurai Jack kind of vibe.

535
00:27:47,723 --> 00:27:48,540
Scott: Yep, this is a villain.

536
00:27:49,406 --> 00:27:50,299
Scott: I lost that vibe now.

537
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,180
Rym: No, really, this villain is... Anyway.

538
00:27:53,625 --> 00:27:53,940
Scott: Anyway.

539
00:27:54,782 --> 00:27:57,199
Rym: We'll see if the show is good, but the music is good.

540
00:27:57,784 --> 00:28:03,580
Rym: In the meta moment, the booklet book will be Margaret Atwood's Orcs and Craig, but Scott, something real bad happened.

541
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,339
Scott: By the way, because I didn't realize this, I just want people to understand.

542
00:28:08,243 --> 00:28:15,399
Scott: When I first heard the name of that book, I thought it was Orcs and Cake, like O-R-C-S and C-A-K-E.

543
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:24,634
Scott: So just because you said the name pretty quickly, I want people to know the way to spell the name of this book.

544
00:28:24,694 --> 00:28:26,799
Scott: is O-R-Y-X, right?

545
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:33,758
Scott: O-R-Y-X and Ampersand, Crake, C-R-A-K-E.

546
00:28:35,429 --> 00:28:36,620
Scott: Like a rake plus a cake?

547
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:43,220
Rym: This is like when we were talking about the Prince of Nothing on the show a long time ago, and we kept saying crow demons, and we meant literal birds.

548
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:44,559
Rym: Like the crow, crows.

549
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:45,033
Scott: Not like...

550
00:28:45,281 --> 00:28:46,840
Rym: C-R-O dash demon.

551
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,840
Scott: Right, not like crow magnin man, right?

552
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:54,859
Scott: Crow, C-R-O-W, like, dash demon, pointy horns.

553
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,240
Rym: But Scott, I'm near the end of a very late book in The Wheel of Time.

554
00:29:00,242 --> 00:29:01,500
Scott: Oh, you know what I saw at the bookstore?

555
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,160
Scott: Because I had time to kill.

556
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:03,958
Rym: The Wheel of Time?

557
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,513
Scott: There was a Wheel of Time companion book that was just 100% glossary.

558
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,920
Scott: It was this giant glossary book that was just a glossary.

559
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:13,140
Rym: The Wikia is populated primarily from that book.

560
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:17,971
Rym: So one of the power levels of all the individual Aes Sedai, ranked 1 through 31, there they are.

561
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,740
Scott: It also had illustrations and maps, and it was a giant hardcover book.

562
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,737
Scott: I think it's actually newish.

563
00:29:25,584 --> 00:29:31,000
Rym: So the Wikia even points out that that book actually contradicts things that are said in the actual Wheel of Time books.

564
00:29:31,681 --> 00:29:32,940
Rym: Your mileage may vary.

565
00:29:34,263 --> 00:29:39,698
Rym: But I was literally about to peter out, I'm gonna stop The Wheel of Time right here, start Oryx and

566
00:29:39,738 --> 00:29:39,979
Rym: Craig.".

567
00:29:40,203 --> 00:29:40,740
Scott: Something happened.

568
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:51,160
Rym: And then I finished the chapter I was in, and basically a character you hadn't seen in a long time appeared and said, "Yo, you wanna know what's up with the fucking dragons?

569
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,679
Rym: The Alefin and the Illfin?

570
00:29:53,162 --> 00:29:53,859
Rym: Remember that tower?

571
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,199
Rym: They're fucking in there.

572
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,298
Rym: Here's the door.

573
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,874
Rym: That's where all the shit's gonna go

574
00:29:57,895 --> 00:29:58,178
Rym: down.".

575
00:29:58,401 --> 00:30:00,400
Scott: Wait, but I thought they were like, "Dragons?

576
00:30:00,481 --> 00:30:02,318
Scott: I thought it was snake people and skin people or

577
00:30:02,338 --> 00:30:02,500
Scott: whatever.".

578
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,099
Rym: Yeah, so... They're dragons?

579
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,020
Rym: Well, I'm pretty sure the dragons are in there.

580
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,800
Scott: Dragons are the snake people?

581
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:15,117
Rym: Basically, someone comes up to a character and is like, "Hey, you know the Alefin and the Illfin and all the snake people

582
00:30:15,157 --> 00:30:15,579
Rym: nonsense?".

583
00:30:15,885 --> 00:30:16,034
Rym: Yeah.

584
00:30:16,942 --> 00:30:18,640
Scott: The shit I wanted to know about them more than anything.

585
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:27,238
Rym: And then it's like, "Hey, remember the tower that people keep bumping into where wise old wolves and wise old people keep saying you're too low level to go into that

586
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:27,579
Rym: tower?".

587
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,640
Scott: Yeah, that's the tower I most want to go into.

588
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:35,000
Rym: Everyone's high enough level to go into the tower, and everyone knows where the tower is, and they know how to...

589
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,180
Scott: Well, isn't it just in the northwest?

590
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:36,687
Scott: I mean...

591
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,400
Rym: Yeah, it's because they see it on that boat.

592
00:30:38,661 --> 00:30:39,438
Scott: Right, yeah, I saw it.

593
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:40,439
Rym: Yeah, so at one point...

594
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,220
Scott: It's not a mystery where... It's not a hidden tower.

595
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:42,818
Scott: It's like, "Oh, there it

596
00:30:42,838 --> 00:30:42,880
Scott: is.".

597
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:47,114
Rym: This character's talking to Matt, and they're like, "The Alefin and the Illfin, he knows the shit about them for obvious

598
00:30:47,154 --> 00:30:47,558
Rym: reasons.".

599
00:30:48,024 --> 00:30:48,599
Rym: Like, he knows.

600
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:54,378
Scott: And it's like in Zelda 1, you bomb, you know, you go into level 9, and it's like, "You need a whole Triforce to come in

601
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:54,480
Scott: here.".

602
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:00,378
Rym: No, it's more like the Tower of Babel in Final Fantasy IV, where you see it there, but there's literally no way to get into it.

603
00:31:00,802 --> 00:31:07,698
Rym: And then later, some character's like, "I heard that all the final stuff at the end of the game is in that giant tower, but we don't know what's in

604
00:31:07,718 --> 00:31:07,900
Rym: there.".

605
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,779
Rym: And then you actually do know, and then you go into it.

606
00:31:10,581 --> 00:31:13,799
Rym: That all just happened, like, on the subway over here.

607
00:31:15,563 --> 00:31:16,520
Rym: So, we'll see.

608
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,498
Rym: Maybe I'll just blitz through the rest of these books real quick.

609
00:31:20,262 --> 00:31:20,937
Rym: We will be!

610
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:25,860
Rym: We finally have a break in Conventions for a little bit, and then, before you know it, PAX East 2016.

611
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:28,338
Scott: The break in Conventions is after PAX East, right?

612
00:31:28,701 --> 00:31:29,240
Scott: Not before.

613
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:34,659
Rym: Yeah, but PAX East, on Sunday at 3.30pm in the Arachnid Theater...

614
00:31:35,041 --> 00:31:36,740
Scott: Wait, what time is the Omegathon finale?

615
00:31:37,223 --> 00:31:37,900
Rym: Sometime after that.

616
00:31:37,961 --> 00:31:39,580
Rym: We will get into the Omegathon finale.

617
00:31:40,446 --> 00:31:41,800
Rym: I have the utmost confidence.

618
00:31:42,121 --> 00:31:43,559
Scott: As long as they get the tabletop night shift.

619
00:31:44,132 --> 00:31:54,110
Rym: The only... So, basically, when I filled out my Enforcer form, I was like, "You pretty much want to give me a night shift, because I have a panel that blocks both other shifts, effectively, on

620
00:31:54,171 --> 00:31:54,516
Rym: Sunday.".

621
00:31:55,743 --> 00:32:00,520
Rym: Because I need an hour or two to get ready for the panel, and all that crap, and then time to tear it down afterward.

622
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:01,737
Rym: So, yeah.

623
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:06,380
Rym: Anyway, 3.30pm, Sunday, Arachnid Theater, Atari Game Design.

624
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:18,320
Rym: And I'm telling you, that is the kind of title of panel that is guaranteed to fill a room, and it's also a panel that I can't guarantee we'll put on YouTube, because it's kind of hard to, like, make that all work out.

625
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,918
Rym: There's a lot of stuff I have to do.

626
00:32:20,464 --> 00:32:22,720
Scott: It's also... Oh, the other panel's better.

627
00:32:23,522 --> 00:32:28,599
Rym: Well, the thing is, the other panel, we did really well, and it's already on YouTube, so you can just watch that one.

628
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:29,477
Rym: Like, if we did...

629
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,779
Scott: Do we have to do the shitty panels more until you get a good one?

630
00:32:33,582 --> 00:32:40,841
Rym: It's more that this panel has a lot more ad-libbing, and a lot more, like, emergent behavior that comes up, so we can't script it 100%.

631
00:32:40,841 --> 00:32:42,680
Scott: Anyway, go to PAX East, or sorry.

632
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:43,591
Rym: Yeah.

633
00:32:44,221 --> 00:32:46,218
Rym: I mean, it might appear on YouTube, but I can't promise it.

634
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:47,550
Rym: Yeah.

635
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,800
Rym: Otherwise, stay tuned for news about other conventions, and...

636
00:32:52,341 --> 00:33:07,860
Scott: So, I just talked about how all the new animes this season that you want to watch are on Crunchyroll, and one of those shows that is on Crunchyroll this season, and apparently still not anywhere else, I don't know if it will be anywhere else, is the new anime adaptation of Phoenix Wright, Ace Attorney.

637
00:33:08,081 --> 00:33:10,019
Rym: It's just called Ace Attorney, or...

638
00:33:10,244 --> 00:33:10,760
Scott: Yeah, it's weird.

639
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:21,413
Scott: I tried to search for Phoenix Wright, and I didn't find it, and then I realized, "Oh, right, this is like a subtitled Japanese show, it's just gonna be called, like, Yakuten Saiban, which is the original name of the game, which is Turnabout

640
00:33:21,454 --> 00:33:21,860
Scott: Courtrooms.".

641
00:33:21,901 --> 00:33:29,531
Scott: I searched for that, and I didn't find it, so I just browsed for it, because I knew it was on there, and it showed up as Ace Attorney just by itself, and I'm like, "Huh,

642
00:33:29,552 --> 00:33:29,936
Scott: okay.".

643
00:33:30,302 --> 00:33:30,780
Rym: So, the genres.

644
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:34,360
Rym: Comedy, mystery, themes, future, lawyers, murder.

645
00:33:34,745 --> 00:33:34,977
Scott: Yes.

646
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,520
Rym: What fucking shows have the theme lawyers?

647
00:33:37,961 --> 00:33:39,638
Scott: I don't know, but we watched...

648
00:33:39,882 --> 00:33:40,599
Rym: It's the only one!

649
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:44,200
Scott: It's the only anime with the theme lawyers, according to Anime News Network and Slavery.

650
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:50,039
Scott: So, we watched episode one today, which is pretty short and easy to watch, and let me tell you this.

651
00:33:50,901 --> 00:33:53,860
Scott: First of all, what was my expectation level for this show, right?

652
00:33:53,943 --> 00:33:54,253
Scott: Pretty low.

653
00:33:55,081 --> 00:33:55,203
Scott: Right?

654
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:56,280
Scott: I mean, well, I don't know.

655
00:33:56,461 --> 00:33:59,660
Scott: I didn't have a low expectation, I basically had a no expectation.

656
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:02,018
Scott: I was like, "Because I didn't know what they were gonna do with

657
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:02,079
Scott: it.".

658
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:09,679
Rym: Well, Scott, we know exactly what our specific expectation was, because we reviewed this show at Anime Boston, and there's video that I'm gonna edit this weekend.

659
00:34:11,045 --> 00:34:12,300
Scott: Yeah, but it's like, I didn't know.

660
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:17,139
Scott: I was like, are they going to redo the video games in anime form?

661
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,460
Scott: Are they going to tell something new with these characters?

662
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,800
Scott: Are they, you know, what is actually gonna be here, right?

663
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:25,580
Scott: It's like, it's been so long since that first game, right?

664
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:32,020
Scott: But clearly, you wanna use the main characters from that first game, because people care about them way more than the other characters from the other games, right?

665
00:34:32,202 --> 00:34:32,460
Scott: Yup.

666
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:36,578
Scott: But what story are you gonna tell with those characters, and how are you gonna tell it?

667
00:34:37,042 --> 00:34:40,719
Scott: And this is not the first time that a Capcom thing has been made into anime.

668
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:45,800
Scott: There are Mega Man anime, and Street Fighter anime, and I think there might be Darkstalkers anime, if I'm not mistaken.

669
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:46,333
Scott: No.

670
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,520
Scott: There's a lot of Capcom things that have become anime.

671
00:34:51,204 --> 00:34:52,398
Scott: How is this one gonna be?

672
00:34:53,181 --> 00:35:03,780
Rym: If it had been the lowest possible rate of animation, like just the video game even, but it had just been new stories forever, like just, let's just make a bunch of Phoenix Wright stories.

673
00:35:03,921 --> 00:35:12,854
Scott: Yeah, that could be good, because you're basically saving the person the trouble of having to play the game, and giving them the same story, plus voice acting, plus actual animation.

674
00:35:12,874 --> 00:35:13,720
Scott: that's a little, you know.

675
00:35:14,103 --> 00:35:18,140
Rym: Yeah, like I could've lived with that, but I, this show is hot garbage.

676
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:22,580
Scott: Yeah, so first of all, the animation is bad.

677
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:29,839
Scott: It's not even like, if they would've just taken GBA animation directly, or DS animation directly, it actually would've been better, right?

678
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,280
Rym: Like, everything's drawn poorly.

679
00:35:33,502 --> 00:35:36,020
Scott: The CG courtroom is like initial D quality.

680
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:40,260
Rym: Oh my god, the jurors in the courtroom are the worst CG.

681
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,458
Rym: Like, they stand out real bad.

682
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:48,940
Scott: This seems like a mad rush job by not good animators who are not putting in a strong effort, right?

683
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:57,239
Rym: And you think, like the opener of a show like this, you know, like we talk about in all our panels, Sailor Moon, like the budget on the opener was more than multiple episodes combined.

684
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:00,160
Scott: Yeah, it's so weird, the closer to the show is actually the best part of the show.

685
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:04,580
Scott: It's like well animated and has good song, goodish song, even though it's not really that memorable, right?

686
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,699
Rym: Well, 'cause it's not that animated, it's stylistic.

687
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:11,780
Scott: Right, but the opener is like, wow, this opener might even look worse than the actual show.

688
00:36:13,461 --> 00:36:15,199
Scott: It definitely doesn't look better than the show.

689
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:18,457
Rym: Emily, when you start watching, she's like, "What the fuck with this run

690
00:36:18,518 --> 00:36:18,680
Rym: cycle?".

691
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:21,300
Scott: Dude, I could tell the run cycle was bad even before she said something.

692
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,360
Rym: The run cycle had like three frames in it.

693
00:36:23,601 --> 00:36:28,457
Scott: She beat me to that, she just beat me to that comment, 'cause like it was obviously, he was like running with only his lower leg.

694
00:36:28,881 --> 00:36:38,560
Rym: Also, guys, it's 2016, your anime opener is generic song, protagonist running sideways across the screen, then later all the other characters running sideways across the screen together.

695
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:39,335
Rym: Like really?

696
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:42,040
Rym: Is this just like El Hazzard?

697
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:52,997
Scott: So, the episode one basically directly retells almost exactly what happens in the very first court case of Phoenix Wright, but it tells it in like 20 minutes.

698
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:59,959
Scott: Dude, if you play that game, right, on your GBA, even if you know all the right answers to everything, it takes a little bit of time.

699
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,020
Scott: It takes longer than that.

700
00:37:01,521 --> 00:37:11,099
Scott: It's rushed, because they've taken out the gameplay, but kept everything else without adjusting the pacing or anything like that, or adding new material, or slowing anything down.

701
00:37:11,841 --> 00:37:16,656
Scott: Everything feels like mad rushed, and it's just like, "Oh my god, everything,".

702
00:37:16,697 --> 00:37:16,799
Scott: and--.

703
00:37:16,981 --> 00:37:27,779
Rym: Now, they lampshaded a little, like it could have been funny if they did this just for this episode, then the show was like, you know, deviated or something, because they even like, whenever there's title cards, it shows like a video game text box.

704
00:37:28,061 --> 00:37:34,300
Scott: Yeah, it's literally, like when they show the evidence on the table, it's like you get the shot of like the piece of evidence by itself.

705
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:38,518
Scott: It's like literally, like it's like really frame for frame, almost from the video game.

706
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,860
Rym: But one, it is just the game.

707
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,640
Rym: There is no reason.

708
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:46,644
Scott: If you have played the game, it's like, for example, the Death Note.

709
00:37:46,805 --> 00:37:50,120
Scott: anime is almost exactly the same as the manga, right?

710
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:52,800
Scott: You know, it's telling the same story basically, right?

711
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:55,380
Rym: But it's got bitchin' music, the voice acting's really good.

712
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:59,660
Scott: But there are reasons to watch it, even if you have already read the manga.

713
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:04,679
Rym: Like Nodame Kontable, if you read the manga, the anime is the same, except you get all the music in it.

714
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,140
Scott: Yeah, it's like, there are reasons to watch adaptation.

715
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,259
Rym: I should say the same thing about Initial D.

716
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:18,800
Scott: Right, and often, for a video game, like if they made Final Fantasy VI, the anime, it's like, there are reasons to watch that as an anime, because like, wow, I can get the whole story without random encounters.

717
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:21,819
Rym: I would watch the hell out of a Final Fantasy VI anime.

718
00:38:22,041 --> 00:38:22,779
Scott: Right, exactly.

719
00:38:22,921 --> 00:38:32,060
Scott: However, here is a case in which there is absolutely nothing to be gained by spending time in your life watching the Phoenix Wright anime, compared to playing the video game.

720
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:39,160
Scott: The video, and even if you've never done either, the video game is a vastly better experience, even though you have to spend time solving the puzzles and stuff.

721
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:45,000
Rym: Like you think it'd be a joke, like in this episode, they literally give Phoenix Wright the tutorial on how to play the anime.

722
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:45,330
Scott: Right.

723
00:38:46,161 --> 00:38:52,800
Rym: And it's, it would be funny, except the preview of Episode 2 implies that it just plays that straight forever.

724
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:58,800
Scott: There are even like images in the preview that were exact images from the second part of the game, right?

725
00:38:59,301 --> 00:39:20,840
Scott: So it, the main problem I had, bigger than all the other problems, is that in the game, there are spacey scenes in which characters are basically emoting ridiculously, like super hyperbolic, you know, emotion, like the witnesses will explode when Phoenix Wright like, exposes their contradictions, right, and have ridiculous expressions and start slamming on stuff and banging their head against the wall.

726
00:39:21,782 --> 00:39:22,819
Scott: All this kind of stuff, right?

727
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,920
Scott: And in the video game, that works.

728
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:30,620
Scott: And the reason it works is because those animations are kind of slow a little bit, right?

729
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,574
Scott: Like the person slamming the head against the wall is like, "Slam, slam,

730
00:39:33,837 --> 00:39:34,080
Scott: slam."

731
00:39:34,901 --> 00:39:37,780
Scott: And they are kind of beyond the typical animation.

732
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:41,131
Rym: So you're watching a static game, and when the guy blows up, it's like, "Oh

733
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:41,477
Rym: shit.".

734
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:50,077
Scott: Right, and it's like this tension build, and then like a pause, and then explode, and then the music is like, "Do, do, do, do, do, do, do,

735
00:39:50,118 --> 00:39:50,219
Scott: do.".

736
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:56,140
Scott: All right, and then you have to read through the text while the person is stuck, and it's like, so it sort of spreads that out a bit.

737
00:39:56,541 --> 00:40:05,019
Scott: When you have that whole thing sort of non-stop at this, almost without the text, you know, pressing A and going through it at video game speed, right?

738
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:11,995
Scott: When you just pull it at full real-time speed, it's like everyone is super annoying, and with voice acting too, right?

739
00:40:12,641 --> 00:40:15,000
Scott: It's like, "Oh my God, everyone shut the fuck up and die.

740
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:15,365
Scott: Oh my

741
00:40:15,386 --> 00:40:15,569
Scott: God.".

742
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:25,140
Scott: It's like what used to be like a hilarious joke, that same thing now because the pacing is sped up, is like annoying and makes you want to kill this character.

743
00:40:26,061 --> 00:40:31,380
Scott: And that really makes it unpleasant to watch, where something that was humorous is now painful.

744
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:37,420
Rym: But also, they miss their mark, so like when he does objection, it just uses the video game thing, like objection.

745
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:40,220
Scott: It does like a little triple super animation, you know?

746
00:40:40,522 --> 00:40:44,599
Rym: But it's not, like him and Edgeworth slamming their hands down, like looks kind of weak.

747
00:40:45,023 --> 00:40:46,800
Scott: They didn't do that a lot, right?

748
00:40:47,081 --> 00:40:48,059
Rym: There wasn't a lot of that.

749
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,280
Rym: But they show it in the opener and it looks weak sauce.

750
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:56,559
Scott: Yeah, you didn't get that sort of slam, pause, finger, finger, thinking, thinking.

751
00:40:57,682 --> 00:41:00,884
Scott: It was like, "Doom, ah, but I got you on the..." Right?

752
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:09,836
Scott: It's like, you got to, you know, the reason that animation worked and had impact in the game is because of that sort of those pauses, like, "Boom, I got you on

753
00:41:09,876 --> 00:41:10,038
Scott: this."

754
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,290
Scott: Or, "Objection, what?

755
00:41:13,074 --> 00:41:13,979
Scott: Ah, let me tell

756
00:41:14,019 --> 00:41:14,119
Scott: you.".

757
00:41:14,381 --> 00:41:16,200
Scott: His name is Naruhodou, right?

758
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,531
Scott: Because he goes, "Ah,

759
00:41:17,713 --> 00:41:18,298
Scott: Naruhodou.".

760
00:41:18,561 --> 00:41:20,360
Scott: And then he explains that, right?

761
00:41:20,661 --> 00:41:22,940
Scott: This, everything was just, you know, it's fast.

762
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:24,960
Scott: And it's got too much excitement.

763
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:29,799
Scott: It's like they're on freaking, you know, some kind of drug and everyone's like made way too much sugar before they went to court.

764
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,059
Rym: Also, let's assume you've never heard of these games.

765
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,040
Scott: Or if you've never heard of Phoenix Wright and never seen any, this is not what you want.

766
00:41:37,401 --> 00:41:40,618
Rym: Or let's say that you've, like, you know the deal, but you never played the first one.

767
00:41:41,442 --> 00:41:43,738
Rym: They start by showing you who the murderer is.

768
00:41:45,203 --> 00:41:46,720
Rym: And then the episode starts.

769
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,933
Rym: You can't even have that Poirot of like, "Oh, I wonder what's going to

770
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:50,259
Rym: happen.".

771
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,676
Rym: Like, it's just, "All right, here it

772
00:41:51,818 --> 00:41:51,879
Rym: is.".

773
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:56,540
Scott: Yeah, in the game, you don't know who the murderers are until, you know, you actually solve the case.

774
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:59,617
Rym: I wonder if episode two will also be like, "Hey, guess who the murderer is?

775
00:42:00,281 --> 00:42:01,209
Rym: Like, this person right

776
00:42:01,249 --> 00:42:01,350
Rym: here.".

777
00:42:02,522 --> 00:42:05,265
Rym: Because it starts, it's like, it literally shows you, "Here's the

778
00:42:05,286 --> 00:42:05,553
Rym: murder.".

779
00:42:05,922 --> 00:42:06,959
Rym: And then the episode starts.

780
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:07,633
Scott: Yep.

781
00:42:09,522 --> 00:42:11,219
Rym: So, I don't think the game did that.

782
00:42:11,947 --> 00:42:12,539
Rym: I don't remember.

783
00:42:13,143 --> 00:42:14,440
Scott: I don't know if it did it for the first one.

784
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,379
Rym: Maybe it did in the first one?

785
00:42:15,602 --> 00:42:19,239
Scott: I mean, the reason it's hard to remember that is because A, it was a long time ago I played it.

786
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:26,918
Scott: And B, it was so obvious who it was that it didn't matter if they told you or not because you'd have to be a moron not to realize it.

787
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,698
Scott: So, you don't remember if they gave it away or if you just knew it.

788
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:32,180
Scott: Because I definitely knew it before the end of the case, right?

789
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:37,529
Scott: So, I guess, like-- It's sort of always, if you don't know who the guilty party is in a Phoenix Wright case, it's like,

790
00:42:37,732 --> 00:42:38,056
Scott: "Wow.".

791
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,359
Scott: I mean, wow.

792
00:42:40,627 --> 00:42:40,877
Scott: Wow.

793
00:42:41,843 --> 00:42:50,500
Rym: I could make more fun of this episode, but everything I would make fun of are things that are just jokes or I would be making fun of the game itself, like the Japanese court system.

794
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:54,413
Rym: Or there's literally, like, "Well, I guess that's the murderer instead of that

795
00:42:54,495 --> 00:42:54,760
Rym: person."

796
00:42:55,741 --> 00:43:01,176
Rym: Like, "Oh, unless you can prove what time it was, we're just gonna hang this other guy because that's how Japan works, I

797
00:43:01,216 --> 00:43:01,398
Rym: guess.".

798
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:01,818
Rym: Right.

799
00:43:02,202 --> 00:43:06,860
Scott: I mean, it's also, you know, even if, you know, regardless of the fact that it's bad, it's too late.

800
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,119
Scott: Phoenix Wright is already-- That's like something we played so long ago.

801
00:43:11,266 --> 00:43:18,240
Scott: Like, in fact, I remember-- Right, this anime should have been out, like, five to ten years ago in the GBA days, right?

802
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,520
Scott: You should have struck while that iron was hot, right?

803
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:25,280
Scott: When that thing came out in the US, like, when the second game came out in the US, that was, like, the timing for this, right?

804
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,800
Rym: Yeah, who cares about Phoenix Wright in 2016?

805
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,100
Scott: People do still care about it.

806
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:34,239
Rym: But they care about, like, Godot and all that shit that happened way later, like, all these other games.

807
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:35,719
Scott: Yeah, and that shit is way better, too.

808
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:39,220
Scott: And it also petered-- You know, it's not at its full strength that it once was.

809
00:43:39,623 --> 00:43:45,398
Scott: And also, this is, like, the weakest-- It might be the worst officially licensed Phoenix Wright thing there is.

810
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:51,500
Rym: In fact, if you want to watch a Phoenix Wright thing, just watch that old turntable turnabout to that Mystery Skull song.

811
00:43:52,207 --> 00:43:56,520
Scott: If you want to see Phoenix Wright without having to spend the time playing through it-- Let's Plays.

812
00:43:56,740 --> 00:44:00,599
Scott: Go on YouTube and find a Let's Play of someone who knows all the answers and goes through it really fast.

813
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Rym: Oh, maybe I should do that for all the games I didn't play.

814
00:44:03,263 --> 00:44:03,578
Scott: You can.

815
00:44:03,881 --> 00:44:04,160
Scott: Sure, why not?

816
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:04,292
Scott: I will.

817
00:44:05,162 --> 00:44:06,560
Scott: Playing them is also just fine, right?

818
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:07,620
Scott: They actually don't take that long.

819
00:44:07,721 --> 00:44:09,460
Scott: It's not like a Final Fantasy with random encounters.

820
00:44:09,761 --> 00:44:11,940
Scott: They're worth playing most of these games.

821
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:16,820
Rym: But for real, guys, this anime is not worth watching at all.

822
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,760
Scott: No, watch Sakamoto Desu Ga.

823
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:19,577
Scott: Don't watch this.

824
00:44:26,062 --> 00:44:28,200
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

825
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:33,320
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

826
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:38,740
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

827
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:41,680
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

828
00:44:41,821 --> 00:44:46,440
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

829

830
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:54,220
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

831
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:57,360
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

832
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:42,870
Rym: The Patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights are Rebecca Dunn, Nicholas Brandau, Alan Joyce, Heidi McNichol, Amanda Duchette, James David White, Christian, At Least I'm Not Named After My Dad, Coops, Jess, MyStady.com, Mechanical Mind, William Eisenbros, Jeremy Miner, Spartacus, Spartacus, Spartacus, Joshiro Jostar, Tyler Eller, Sean Yeager, Clinton Walton, Ren from New Zealand, Robert Lee, Ryan Perrin, Drew Openlander, Rare Lavell, Brian Cedroni, Rochelle Montanona, Finn, Eric Silveron, Can't Melt, Steel Beams,

833
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:43,653
Scott: Kinetic

834
00:45:43,714 --> 00:45:50,790
Rym: Man, Eric Cerise, Chris Midcave, Chris Knox, Flame Darkfire, Sam Grodery, Daniel Redman, Chris Haddad, Sean Klein, Chris Reimer, and Thomas Hahn.

835
00:45:51,232 --> 00:45:55,890
Rym: It is getting really hard to say that all in one go, you guys, you have no idea.

836
00:45:56,290 --> 00:46:01,510
Rym: That is why I set the threshold for me doing that at $5.

837
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:11,610
Rym: So, anyway, the updates I got for you on GeekNights is we're gonna do the Q&A from the last month real soon, and then we're gonna immediately open questions for the next Q&A with a pretty good theme, I think.

838
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:13,469
Rym: So we're getting back on a regular schedule for that.

839
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:15,169
Rym: I got some Rimmle reviews coming up.

840
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:18,610
Rym: I got a bunch of Rym's Rants that I'm gonna trickle out.

841
00:46:19,335 --> 00:46:33,811
Rym: And, as I promised, I am, this weekend, at least by the weekend, I'm gonna put up the first beta ever of GeekNights ever, for you guys only, only the Patreons, so you can see what we were like before October 31st, 2005.

842
00:46:33,811 --> 00:46:43,910
Rym: And if we hit that goal, I'm gonna put up all the rest of the beta episodes, some of which I discovered were never published and are not anywhere on the internet.

843
00:46:44,391 --> 00:46:49,549
Rym: So those of you who have found them, there are at least three that you have never found as far as I can tell.

844
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:52,190
Rym: I hope we didn't say anything weird or bad in them.

845
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:53,109
Rym: I guess I have to listen to them.

846
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:58,750
Rym: Also, I should have Judge Anime by its cover, since we reviewed this terrible Phoenix Wright anime.

847
00:46:58,831 --> 00:47:04,030
Rym: we just reviewed, for real, on that, and you'll be able to see what we said about it before we saw the first episode.

848
00:47:04,291 --> 00:47:08,589
Rym: I should have that up before the end of the weekend, unless something goes horribly awry.

849
00:47:10,172 --> 00:47:17,670
Rym: And if you're waiting to submit things to ConnectiCon, honestly, I don't know what to tell you, the back end, like I'm not gonna lie, is kind of a disaster.

850
00:47:17,831 --> 00:47:26,390
Rym: They switched it on me without consulting me, and I'm not sure what to do about it, 'cause it just doesn't work for panel submissions, and I know we're getting really late in the game.

851
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:36,129
Rym: If I had my druthers, I would have opened panel submissions in like January, or hell, if I could, I'd just open them literally on Sunday at the previous ConnectiCon.

852
00:47:37,031 --> 00:47:43,370
Rym: So stay tuned, as soon as I know anything, I'll let you guys know, and now I leave you with something weird.
