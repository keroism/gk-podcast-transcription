1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,780
Rym: It's Thursday, November 10th, 2016.

2
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:11,161
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:14,328
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,711 --> 00:00:16,178
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight.

5
00:00:16,561 --> 00:00:17,909
Rym: Somehow we never did a show on this.

6
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,169
Rym: Talking about wallets.

7
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:23,387
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:27,175 --> 00:00:31,650
Rym: So over the weekend, Scott, uh, uh, Gold me into doing this thing and I did it.

9
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:32,704
Scott: I didn't goad you into doing it.

10
00:00:32,744 --> 00:00:33,029
Scott: You agreed.

11
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,970
Scott: Well, you told me it was- I told you it existed.

12
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:35,999
Rym: You told me it existed.

13
00:00:36,201 --> 00:00:42,410
Rym: You expressed- I actually- You expressed mild, uh, suspicion that I would wake up early enough to do it.

14
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:42,611
Rym: Right.

15
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:48,569
Scott: I anti-goaded you by telling you you'd have to wake up at not the crack-ass of dawn, but the crack-ass of dawn.

16
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:50,248
Scott: Crack-a-crackity-crack.

17
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,310
Rym: Like, I got up at- when did I leave the house?

18
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:56,431
Scott: I woke up at like 4.30, 4.45.

19
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:56,552
Scott: Okay.

20
00:00:56,572 --> 00:00:58,090
Rym: I don't think I actually left.

21
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:02,170
Scott: I left at like 5.15, 5.30.

22
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:04,870
Rym: 'Cause it took- it didn't take me that long to bike down there to the starting point.

23
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,209
Scott: Well, I'm farther away than you.

24
00:01:06,431 --> 00:01:06,754
Rym: You are.

25
00:01:06,956 --> 00:01:08,289
Rym: Also, I bike a lot faster.

26
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:09,929
Scott: You're trying to bike faster.

27
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:15,730
Rym: Though, yo, I noticed that, 'cause usually when I bike with you, like, no, you're not slow, but you're not fast.

28
00:01:15,931 --> 00:01:16,629
Rym: I could go faster.

29
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:17,332
Rym: But then you bike.

30
00:01:17,352 --> 00:01:20,665
Rym: Yeah, what I'm saying, when we started biking, I went at the usual speed.

31
00:01:20,725 --> 00:01:22,009
Rym: I think I'll go when I'm with you.

32
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,649
Rym: And then you were like, whoosh, 'cause you have that good bike now.

33
00:01:25,174 --> 00:01:25,970
Rym: You are going faster.

34
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:29,290
Scott: I'm not tr- I just- whenever I bike, I just go- I'm not in a race.

35
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:30,710
Rym: You're not huffing and puffing like I am.

36
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:33,089
Scott: Yeah, you're huffing and puffing and I'm just sorta like, doo-doo-doo-doo.

37
00:01:33,672 --> 00:01:36,023
Rym: No, I was- I was legit impressed with your speed.

38
00:01:36,084 --> 00:01:41,408
Scott: That is- that bike- I mean, oh, yes, I'm so impressed with your speed in that F1 car.

39
00:01:44,092 --> 00:01:48,509
Rym: It almost makes me want to get another bike, 'cause I got a hybrid, which doesn't have- it's not like that.

40
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:56,770
Scott: Especially 'cause also I was recently mountain biking, so- I didn't buy the- like, when I bought the bike, the guy at the bike store was like, you know, fancy bike doesn't make you go faster.

41
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,000
Scott: I'm like, I know, I'm not buying it to go faster.

42
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,250
Scott: I'm buying it because, you know, it's more comfortable.

43
00:02:01,531 --> 00:02:05,310
Rym: Well, who's the kid in the forum who was like, I'm too slow going up hills, what bike should I buy?

44
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:06,908
Rym: And we were like, ahhh.

45
00:02:08,312 --> 00:02:10,566
Scott: No matter what bike you buy, the engine is the same.

46
00:02:10,586 --> 00:02:11,130
Scott: Your leg.

47
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,058
Scott: But, yeah, it's just more comfortable, right?

48
00:02:14,078 --> 00:02:17,470
Scott: It's like, if I had to do that ride on my other bike, my ass would hurt.

49
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:21,330
Scott: So, but on this bike, I could just sit on it all goddamn day.

50
00:02:21,611 --> 00:02:24,090
Rym: Ah, thing is, I wear the, uh, fancy pants.

51
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,688
Scott: I also got the fancy pants, but even using the fancy pants- Not fancy enough.

52
00:02:29,692 --> 00:02:30,569
Scott: Really not fancy enough.

53
00:02:31,152 --> 00:02:37,249
Rym: My pants are pretty- actually, some of my pants are fancy, but most of my bike shorts are bullshit Chinese bootlegs.

54
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:42,270
Scott: I bought the- this is one brand on Amazon, and it fit, so I got that brand.

55
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:50,410
Rym: I have two for-real ones that I wear under other shorts, and then I have, like, because Emily and I are the same size-ish, so, I bought, like, six pairs of these bootleg fucking bike shorts.

56
00:02:50,550 --> 00:03:01,328
Scott: Basically, what it is, the New York City Marathon happens, right, and it starts in Staten Island, it goes up Brooklyn, Queens, over the bridge, up to the Bronx, down, and then into Central Park, and then in the bottom of Central Park.

57
00:03:01,368 --> 00:03:01,850
Scott: in the end, right?

58
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:16,269
Scott: So, we start in Astoria, and we go all the way down to the bottom ass of Brooklyn, we can't go to Staten Island, and then we start, like, way before the race starts, 'cause you can't- otherwise, it's like one of those video games where the spike wall is going from the left side of the screen.

59
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:16,663
Scott: Yeah.

60
00:03:17,451 --> 00:03:20,890
Scott: Right, all the runners, and also the police would kick you off the road at a certain point.

61
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,970
Rym: Yeah, they'd probably taze you off the road at that point.

62
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:31,370
Scott: Yeah, you have to get to the end, you have to start way before the runners start, and get to the end before the cops close the road, and there's still technically cars on the road, is that closed?

63
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,810
Rym: Yep, but there's way less cars?

64
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:38,830
Scott: There's almost no cars, because there's all these people setting up all the water tables, and the clocks, and all the marathon shit.

65
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:44,950
Rym: So, you gotta kind of avoid all that shit, too, like in the Pulaski, they had that giant timer, and you couldn't get on the regular road yet, and there's all that-.

66
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:48,290
Scott: Oh, yeah, but I mean, you know, it was like, you get the idea, right?

67
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,716
Scott: It's like, it's a mostly closed road, right?

68
00:03:50,937 --> 00:03:59,570
Scott: You can pedal for a long ass time without having to stop, it's pretty nice, you don't have to pay to enter into some race or anything, or win a lottery, or get a bib, or any of that nonsense, you know?

69
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:05,370
Scott: And then, so you go up, and I cross over the Queensborough Bridge, and you can cross over the not pedestrian bike park.

70
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,868
Rym: Yep, which I've only done once.

71
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:15,150
Rym: I did it two times, and that was nice, and then you go- That was the point where I bailed, because I didn't suspect I'd easily be able to get back home without taking my bike on the subway.

72
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:19,125
Rym: So, yeah, so then- I was in front of my apartment, it was real tempting, you'd be like, "I'll just go

73
00:04:19,147 --> 00:04:19,509
Rym: inside.".

74
00:04:20,091 --> 00:04:28,650
Scott: So then I go to the Bronx, and then I go down, right, the east side of the park, and then over to 59th street, and you can't go to the finish line, it's closed off.

75
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:32,366
Rym: So you just- Yep, the reddit was like, "Don't fucking go, like, all the

76
00:04:32,386 --> 00:04:32,628
Rym: way!".

77
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:37,329
Scott: Right, so you're at Columbus Circle, and then they're like, "You can't do- that's the end of

78
00:04:37,369 --> 00:04:37,510
Scott: you.".

79
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:45,010
Scott: So then I try to go home, and I get back to the bridge, and even the pedestrian part of the bridge is, like, closed.

80
00:04:45,131 --> 00:04:48,649
Scott: And I ask the cops, I'm like, "Oh, can I just go over this fence and go

81
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:48,870
Scott: home?".

82
00:04:48,911 --> 00:04:49,240
Scott: And they're like,

83
00:04:49,343 --> 00:04:49,508
Scott: "No.".

84
00:04:49,651 --> 00:04:50,039
Scott: And I'm like,

85
00:04:50,325 --> 00:04:50,550
Scott: "Really?".

86
00:04:51,272 --> 00:04:53,390
Scott: They're running over that part, I'm on this part.

87
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:57,150
Rym: They close it there every year for security reasons.

88
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:02,144
Scott: And I'm like, "The runners aren't gonna be here for, like, 45 minutes to an hour, right?

89
00:05:02,245 --> 00:05:03,970
Scott: I won't even see the first place person.

90
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:06,208
Scott: I'll be over this bridge in, like, two

91
00:05:06,248 --> 00:05:06,410
Scott: minutes.".

92
00:05:06,733 --> 00:05:08,309
Rym: You're trying to negotiate with a New York cop.

93
00:05:09,051 --> 00:05:12,308
Scott: I tried to negotiate with two different cops to let me over.

94
00:05:14,135 --> 00:05:16,850
Scott: One was on First Avenue, and one was on that bridge.

95
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:19,043
Rym: You should have tried to legit bribe them.

96
00:05:19,104 --> 00:05:20,070
Rym: That would probably have worked.

97
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,290
Scott: And one was on the bridge side.

98
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,723
Rym: You should have been like, "My friend Alexander

99
00:05:23,764 --> 00:05:24,226
Rym: Hamilton.".

100
00:05:24,971 --> 00:05:28,870
Scott: Anyway, so they didn't let me go over the fence, right?

101
00:05:29,533 --> 00:05:31,610
Rym: I got a whole roll of George Washington.

102
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,869
Scott: So I had to get over this river.

103
00:05:34,771 --> 00:05:38,710
Rym: The only way at that point was you could either take the F train, which sucks, or you could take the...

104
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,587
Scott: I could take a train under the river.

105
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:49,290
Scott: Right, so my choices were try to go up the east side path to see if I could get to Randall's Island using that bridge.

106
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:50,870
Rym: Which you could have, I think.

107
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:52,569
Scott: I think it would have worked.

108
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,589
Rym: So that's a loop I run on a regular basis.

109
00:05:56,231 --> 00:06:01,390
Rym: I run over the Queensborough, up Manhattan, over the Randall's Island bridge, over the RFK, back home through Astoria.

110
00:06:01,532 --> 00:06:03,090
Scott: I think that would have worked, maybe.

111
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,310
Rym: Because the marathon doesn't go over any of that.

112
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,350
Scott: But I ended up just taking the Skycar to Roosevelt Island.

113
00:06:07,571 --> 00:06:08,490
Rym: And then that's an easy bike home.

114
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,889
Scott: Using the Roosevelt Island bridge, which totally worked.

115
00:06:11,892 --> 00:06:14,470
Scott: And it's free because you just use your metro card to go on the Skycar.

116
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:18,490
Scott: But when I was on the Skycar, I think I saw people running on that east side path.

117
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:19,769
Rym: Oh, good call then.

118
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:20,857
Scott: I think it would have worked.

119
00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:22,390
Scott: No, the marathon wasn't running.

120
00:06:22,511 --> 00:06:24,248
Rym: Oh, okay, I thought you were like, "Oh, the marathon wouldn't have

121
00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:24,410
Rym: worked.".

122
00:06:24,532 --> 00:06:25,950
Scott: No, no, no, just regular people.

123
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:27,690
Scott: So it was open, is what I'm saying.

124
00:06:27,751 --> 00:06:32,790
Scott: The path, I could have used the... Or the other option was pay for a ferry.

125
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,350
Scott: Oh, yeah, yeah.

126
00:06:34,652 --> 00:06:36,810
Scott: Or go down to use the Williamsburg bridge.

127
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,930
Scott: But if I go over the Williamsburg bridge, what's going to happen on the other side?

128
00:06:40,151 --> 00:06:41,690
Rym: You're going to get the Pulaski area.

129
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:44,028
Scott: I'm going to go over there and there's going to be a closed road.

130
00:06:44,514 --> 00:06:45,310
Scott: And I can't go north.

131
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:52,050
Rym: You would have had to go way out, up, and back over in those weird areas that you occasionally bike into by accident.

132
00:06:52,855 --> 00:06:55,030
Scott: So what is even the next bridge?

133
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:58,290
Scott: If I go north more, what is the next way to cross?

134
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:01,490
Scott: Like, go to Connecticut and use the Port Jefferson ferry?

135
00:07:02,691 --> 00:07:05,049
Rym: I'll call an Uber and get it to drive you over the... I don't know.

136
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:07,850
Scott: I guess I could have put my bike in a car.

137
00:07:08,976 --> 00:07:09,327
Scott: But no.

138
00:07:10,334 --> 00:07:11,710
Rym: I was next to my apartment.

139
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:15,870
Rym: And also, I had gotten ahead of, because you got trapped behind that yelling woman.

140
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,870
Rym: And I finally got past her, and I didn't want to get caught by her again.

141
00:07:20,793 --> 00:07:22,350
Scott: Yeah, they were a group of yelling people.

142
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,909
Rym: They were real excited about this.

143
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:26,429
Scott: They started yelling less later on.

144
00:07:26,691 --> 00:07:27,950
Rym: Maybe they ran their voices out.

145
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,229
Scott: They got tired on the Queensborough bridge, I think, and took the yell out of them.

146
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:34,890
Rym: So I think it's obvious we were kind of stalling, because there's only one news today.

147
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,370
Rym: Possibly the darkest day in modern American history.

148
00:07:38,771 --> 00:07:40,249
Scott: I don't know if it's the darkest day.

149
00:07:40,834 --> 00:07:42,009
Rym: It's the most dangerous day.

150
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:42,738
Scott: It's not.

151
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:43,289
Scott: Well, listen.

152
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,530
Rym: What do you mean by modern history?

153
00:07:46,252 --> 00:07:48,830
Rym: The Vietnam War is distant past for most people.

154
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:49,748
Scott: Here's what I'm saying, right?

155
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:56,670
Scott: We're at a point where people are somewhat legitimately worried about nuclear disaster soon.

156
00:07:57,433 --> 00:07:59,570
Scott: The Cuban Missile Crisis was a thing.

157
00:07:59,872 --> 00:08:00,268
Rym: It was.

158
00:08:01,053 --> 00:08:02,749
Scott: So we're less than that.

159
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:10,589
Rym: But at the same time, when that happened, it was two extremely competent national leaders talking on the phone and dealing with it.

160
00:08:11,311 --> 00:08:15,930
Rym: I'm just saying, the danger is probably similar, but different.

161
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:19,009
Rym: But similar actual magnitude in the end.

162
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:21,012
Scott: I watched Dr.

163
00:08:21,032 --> 00:08:24,424
Scott: Strangelove yesterday because, and in Dr.

164
00:08:24,444 --> 00:08:36,690
Scott: Strangelove, which is a comedy, the two national leaders, even though one of them is intoxicated, are more competent than many national leaders in the real world.

165
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:45,743
Rym: I mean, we're not going to dwell on it tonight, because I'm pretty sure, as much as all of us have been dealing with this, I don't think you really want to hear yet another podcast.

166
00:08:45,763 --> 00:08:47,290
Rym: spend their entire show talking about it.

167
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,609
Scott: It's too soon, and it's not time yet.

168
00:08:49,812 --> 00:08:50,427
Rym: But I'll say this.

169
00:08:51,151 --> 00:08:54,889
Rym: The mood in New York City was real, real somber.

170
00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:01,770
Scott: Imagine you see someone and they come to work the first day after their dog died.

171
00:09:02,717 --> 00:09:04,050
Scott: Or someone in their family died.

172
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,830
Rym: I knew shit was up, because I went to work early.

173
00:09:06,091 --> 00:09:19,650
Scott: Imagine if every single person in the city, except for that one guy driving his minivan in Astoria, raving his red hat at the window, and he's lucky that we're in a city and there aren't rocks on the ground.

174
00:09:23,451 --> 00:09:28,110
Scott: Pretty much everybody was acting like someone in their family had just died.

175
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,558
Rym: And no one went to work.

176
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:30,726
Rym: I got a little early.

177
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,850
Rym: It was very, very uncrowded.

178
00:09:33,691 --> 00:09:38,330
Rym: I got on the subway, and I sat down on the four train during the commute.

179
00:09:38,773 --> 00:09:39,650
Scott: That is insane.

180
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,289
Scott: I could have sat down, but I don't sit down.

181
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,698
Rym: And I think what really struck me was.

182
00:09:43,739 --> 00:09:47,970
Rym: I was sitting there, and there was a dude, just another white dude, obviously going to some sort of Wall Street looking job.

183
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,110
Rym: He kind of looked like I do, except he was wearing a suit.

184
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,790
Rym: And he's reading CNN on his tablet, and then he just starts crying.

185
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:54,686
Rym: He just puts his head down.

186
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:57,730
Rym: And I saw that playing out all over the place.

187
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:00,629
Rym: But then I get to work, and no one's there yet, except my boss.

188
00:10:01,355 --> 00:10:03,290
Rym: And he's just sitting there staring at his computer.

189
00:10:03,831 --> 00:10:08,150
Rym: And basically, it looked like he'd been there a while already, and no one talked.

190
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:10,210
Rym: Everyone just sat staring at the computers all day doing nothing.

191
00:10:11,012 --> 00:10:12,170
Rym: No one really got any work done.

192
00:10:13,111 --> 00:10:18,730
Scott: It was already well known in advance that there was going to be a catered lunch on that day.

193
00:10:19,253 --> 00:10:20,589
Scott: And it was Thanksgiving food.

194
00:10:21,451 --> 00:10:24,743
Scott: We had a turkey leg and yams and stuffing.

195
00:10:28,153 --> 00:10:30,870
Scott: And we pretty much sat in the boardroom eating it quietly.

196
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:32,291
Rym: Yup.

197
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:38,290
Rym: The worst part, well not the worst part, but I remember on the night when it was actually all going down, we were doing our Overwatch thing.

198
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:41,430
Rym: We didn't really want to sit and just watch the whole stupid election.

199
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,950
Rym: So we were playing Overwatch in a big voice chat on Discord.

200
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:51,887
Rym: And bit by bit, as the news started getting more and more dire, at one point, Scojo was like, "I just can't pay attention to the game.

201
00:10:51,907 --> 00:10:52,228
Rym: I gotta

202
00:10:52,248 --> 00:10:52,288
Rym: go.".

203
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,770
Rym: And he just left, and then everyone just left.

204
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,249
Scott: I'm surprised he didn't even play the game.

205
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:00,788
Rym: Well, we were playing the game, and then it started looking dicey.

206
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,730
Rym: And I pretty much spent half the night looking at the internet.

207
00:11:05,271 --> 00:11:06,160
Rym: And then I said, "Fuck it.

208
00:11:06,362 --> 00:11:06,949
Rym: I can't deal with

209
00:11:06,989 --> 00:11:07,070
Rym: this.".

210
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:07,669
Rym: And I just went to bed.

211
00:11:08,454 --> 00:11:09,349
Scott: I went to bed also.

212
00:11:09,874 --> 00:11:10,030
Rym: Yup.

213
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,830
Rym: So yeah, we're not going to really dwell on it yet on the show, obviously.

214
00:11:15,451 --> 00:11:16,982
Rym: But Scott's got some ideas.

215
00:11:17,285 --> 00:11:18,010
Rym: I got some ideas.

216
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:19,729
Rym: And we're not going to take this sitting down.

217
00:11:22,272 --> 00:11:23,666
Scott: Like I said, Rin, before the show, right?

218
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:24,488
Scott: Yup.

219
00:11:25,412 --> 00:11:27,530
Scott: People are going to yell at me because I was quiet.

220
00:11:28,371 --> 00:11:29,100
Scott: And I was like, "Shut

221
00:11:29,201 --> 00:11:29,262
Scott: up.".

222
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:35,607
Scott: But the fact is, all you assholes, I was wrong about things that everyone else was wrong about, like what the result was going to be.

223
00:11:37,212 --> 00:11:39,929
Scott: But I was right that you were just tweeting in the wind uselessly.

224
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:41,430
Scott: And your tweets didn't do shit.

225
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:43,300
Scott: And now, what are people doing?

226
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,429
Scott: They're still tweeting in the wind.

227
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,090
Scott: So you're eagle time.

228
00:11:46,752 --> 00:11:47,608
Scott: Eagle time is over.

229
00:11:48,211 --> 00:11:49,489
Scott: It is now the sanctuary time.

230
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:52,290
Scott: And we're going to do shit and not just fucking tweet in the wind.

231
00:11:58,582 --> 00:12:01,240
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

232
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,117
Rym: This is a video from Numberphile, which we link to occasionally, but I'm not going to...

233
00:12:06,281 --> 00:12:07,940
Scott: Numberphile making all the things of the day.

234
00:12:08,442 --> 00:12:09,400
Rym: I haven't linked to them in a while.

235
00:12:10,203 --> 00:12:21,020
Scott: You know, I figured out, I stupidly didn't realize this before, but Numberphile and the periodic thing is like this one guy, Brady.

236
00:12:21,461 --> 00:12:22,400
Scott: There's other channels, too.

237
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,800
Scott: I'm not sure if he does the Computerphile channel, which I don't watch.

238
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,800
Rym: It's a lot like the SciShow and Vlogbrothers.

239
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,640
Rym: They're all in an orbit of each other.

240
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,880
Scott: There's this one dude, Brady, and he's making these videos.

241
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,479
Scott: And the thing that really gets me about these videos is that he sounds like he's a person from the UK.

242
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:42,140
Scott: And I know that the periodic place that's college is in the UK, right?

243
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:46,100
Scott: But it seems like he's traveling around the world making these videos.

244
00:12:46,601 --> 00:12:52,420
Rym: Scott, just saying, if the Patreon got to a high enough level, we'd both quit our jobs and our lives would be making shit like that all the time.

245
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:53,939
Scott: But I don't want to do that.

246
00:12:54,624 --> 00:12:57,379
Scott: It seems like it's pretty crazy, this thing this guy's got going on.

247
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:03,897
Rym: But this video is pretty actually specifically interesting, and it talks about weird but fair dice.

248
00:13:04,681 --> 00:13:05,379
Scott: Oh, I saw this one.

249
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:13,219
Rym: And you might think that a die has to be a regular, you know, like one of the regular three-dimensional shapes to be fair.

250
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:13,592
Rym: Nope.

251
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,838
Rym: And that is not true.

252
00:13:15,181 --> 00:13:27,720
Rym: To be fair, a die merely needs to be symmetrical, and this video does an excellent job of making that abundantly clear, and I kind of want some dice like that just to start arguments at tables, at conventions.

253
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,700
Scott: It's good for an RPG, that kind of dice, right, where it's not gambling.

254
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,160
Rym: Well, for gambling, it should be fine, actually.

255
00:13:34,621 --> 00:13:35,257
Scott: Yeah, well, you know.

256
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,398
Rym: Also, the funniest thing is he's rolling, what, like the D120, and he rolls a one twice in a row.

257
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:57,960
Scott: So anyway, you know, back in the day, I remember, especially in the college days, right, there was this period in my life, like when I was in middle school, high school, where like Japan seemed like this mystical place full of nerd magic, and very rarely did you actually learn anything about the nerd magic they had there.

258
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:03,176
Scott: Maybe like you'd get a video game magazine to be a picture of an arcade game they had there that you were just like, "Holy

259
00:14:03,318 --> 00:14:03,460
Scott: shit.".

260
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,538
Rym: Yep, and it'd have a caption that just says like, "Gundam game in

261
00:14:06,578 --> 00:14:06,880
Rym: Japan."

262
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,940
Rym: It doesn't tell you shit about it.

263
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,620
Scott: Or like you'd get an anime that was dubbed.

264
00:14:09,801 --> 00:14:11,440
Scott: You'd be like, "Oh, glorious," right?

265
00:14:12,222 --> 00:14:14,720
Scott: And then in college, it was like the Japan Fiesta.

266
00:14:16,884 --> 00:14:21,600
Rym: It was like-- RIT that had this giant anime club.

267
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:33,038
Scott: But anyway, you know, we eventually, like even early in the GeekNights days, we were still like half my things of the day were funny things from Japanese TV, because we finally had internet and YouTube and things like that.

268
00:14:34,161 --> 00:14:41,399
Scott: But eventually, the cool Japan magic never completely wears off, because Japan is still way cool in Nerd Paradise.

269
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:45,918
Scott: But eventually, you're like, "Okay, another cool thing from Japan.

270
00:14:46,038 --> 00:14:46,139
Scott: All

271
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:46,320
Scott: right.".

272
00:14:46,843 --> 00:14:48,733
Scott: But here's one that I saw recently.

273
00:14:48,753 --> 00:14:50,000
Scott: that was pretty awesome.

274
00:14:50,601 --> 00:14:53,940
Scott: And you know, it's too early for Christmas shit, but this is too awesome.

275
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,659
Scott: It breaks the rule.

276
00:14:55,401 --> 00:14:58,760
Scott: It's a Coke bottle, poison I don't drink, from Japan.

277
00:14:59,542 --> 00:15:01,319
Scott: And it's a Christmas-style one.

278
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,880
Scott: And I don't know why they only have this in Japan.

279
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:09,499
Scott: It's like they only, you know, they just hate us.

280
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,200
Rym: All right, I'm just watching this video to see what happens here.

281
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:12,919
Scott: Oh, you never saw the video?

282
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:13,243
Scott: Nope.

283
00:15:13,688 --> 00:15:14,699
Rym: I never-- I did not see this.

284
00:15:14,964 --> 00:15:15,240
Rym: Okay.

285
00:15:15,442 --> 00:15:17,580
Rym: All right, so you see he's pulling-- What?

286
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:20,875
Rym: Oh, I see what's going on here.

287
00:15:22,002 --> 00:15:22,538
Rym: That's good.

288
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,098
Scott: It's real good.

289
00:15:25,561 --> 00:15:26,118
Rym: God damn it.

290
00:15:27,424 --> 00:15:27,526
Rym: Why--.

291
00:15:27,546 --> 00:15:28,640
Rym: This is why we can't have nice things.

292
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,430
Scott: Only, you know, the U.S.

293
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:32,719
Scott: just doesn't have nice things, and now we're going to have less nice things.

294
00:15:33,121 --> 00:15:33,698
Rym: I mean, yeah.

295
00:15:35,003 --> 00:15:35,940
Rym: Way to bring it back around.

296
00:15:37,221 --> 00:15:41,438
Rym: Well, you know, speaking of nice things, when Emily and I were in Sydney, the one thing that's-- They didn't have that.

297
00:15:41,905 --> 00:15:42,058
Scott: Nope.

298
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:43,620
Scott: And isn't their money worth nothing?

299
00:15:43,841 --> 00:15:45,713
Rym: But they're doing okay now.

300
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:53,000
Rym: But the subway in Sydney, because you've been on the trams, like they were like okay in Melbourne.

301
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:53,999
Scott: It's much newer than ours.

302
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:59,939
Rym: The subway in Sydney not only has padded cloth seats-- The New York City subway used to.

303
00:16:00,685 --> 00:16:01,538
Rym: Yeah, does not now.

304
00:16:01,969 --> 00:16:02,076
Rym: No.

305
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,019
Rym: Because they would literally be full of poop.

306
00:16:04,385 --> 00:16:04,520
Rym: Yes.

307
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,720
Rym: Like they would be cut open, filled with poop, and smeared with poop.

308
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:08,958
Scott: Metro and art trains have them.

309
00:16:10,783 --> 00:16:11,520
Rym: Not really.

310
00:16:12,443 --> 00:16:13,179
Scott: Yeah, they're padded.

311
00:16:13,627 --> 00:16:13,994
Rym: They're padded.

312
00:16:14,621 --> 00:16:15,080
Rym: They're leather seats.

313
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:20,880
Rym: They're waterproof leather, and they're, you know, they're padded by the barest technical definition of padded.

314
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,017
Scott: I'm just saying.

315
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,560
Rym: These are thick, plush seats.

316
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,620
Rym: Like if you spilled something into them, it's gone.

317
00:16:26,921 --> 00:16:28,320
Scott: Like first class airplane?

318
00:16:29,142 --> 00:16:33,020
Rym: Yeah, like I could pee into one of those things for days before it started coming out.

319
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,236
Rym: Like you could pee.

320
00:16:34,565 --> 00:16:34,878
Scott: All right.

321
00:16:35,281 --> 00:16:36,920
Rym: So yeah, we could not have that here.

322
00:16:37,543 --> 00:16:37,589
Scott: No.

323
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:41,280
Rym: In a moment, the Book Club book is Rebecca.

324
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:42,378
Rym: Rebecca.

325
00:16:42,763 --> 00:16:45,439
Rym: I'm going to read it because I finished all those other books I was working on.

326
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,979
Rym: They're pretty good and all that stuff.

327
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:51,556
Scott: I'm going to read it because my queue is really open right now.

328
00:16:52,640 --> 00:17:00,420
Rym: You know what I'm going to read right after I finish Rebecca because I've read excerpts from it, but I feel remiss that I've never actually read Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail.

329
00:17:01,042 --> 00:17:01,579
Scott: Oh, that one?

330
00:17:01,862 --> 00:17:02,057
Scott: Yeah.

331
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:05,898
Rym: And I feel like I missed that man, so I'm going to read that.

332
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:11,680
Rym: Otherwise, one great thing, GamerX East is this weekend.

333
00:17:11,983 --> 00:17:12,852
Scott: G-A-Y-M-E-R-X.

334
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,660
Rym: It is unfortunately, as of today, if you're not already going, too late to get badges.

335
00:17:18,021 --> 00:17:18,480
Scott: It's sold out.

336
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,780
Scott: Is it sold out or is it just too late?

337
00:17:21,204 --> 00:17:21,679
Rym: It's too late.

338
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:23,079
Rym: I think it might also be sold out.

339
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:23,778
Rym: I'm not sure.

340
00:17:24,641 --> 00:17:25,680
Scott: So you can't get them at the door.

341
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,479
Rym: Oh, you might be able to get them until midnight tonight.

342
00:17:28,348 --> 00:17:28,640
Scott: Oh, okay.

343
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,899
Rym: It's because it's in a secure building, so there's a list you have to be on.

344
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,140
Scott: Oh, it's one of those.

345
00:17:34,782 --> 00:17:35,520
Scott: Actually, where is it?

346
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:36,759
Scott: It's in the Microsoft space.

347
00:17:37,925 --> 00:17:40,020
Scott: Oh, right near the Muji store?

348
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:40,459
Rym: I think so.

349
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,079
Rym: I think it's that one.

350
00:17:41,501 --> 00:17:41,820
Scott: Oh, okay.

351
00:17:41,981 --> 00:17:42,580
Rym: It's like right there.

352
00:17:43,501 --> 00:17:46,260
Scott: I thought it was in a real space, so it's not going to be as big as I thought.

353
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,240
Rym: No, it's small, but it's sort of like an outreach thing.

354
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,839
Rym: I feel like it's good timing that we're going to this.

355
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,240
Scott: I feel like a lot of people -- No, I mean, I can play games all day.

356
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,739
Scott: Are you going to go there as soon as it starts Saturday?

357
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:55,937
Rym: Maybe.

358
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,059
Rym: Maybe we should probably just go there as soon as it starts, and we can always leave early and get food.

359
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,540
Scott: Yeah, just going to bring games with me, right?

360
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,480
Rym: Yeah, I'm going to bring a small but choice collection of tabletop games.

361
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:04,880
Scott: Yep.

362
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,640
Rym: And someday we're going to be giving a talk -- I'll bring some RPG.

363
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:19,403
Rym: We're going to be doing our writing game rules panel, but if you already knew who we are, if you're already listening to this, tell other people to go to our panel, but don't you fucking go to it, because it's a small room, and I'd rather people who don't know who we are -- How small

364
00:18:19,484 --> 00:18:19,645
Scott: am I?

365
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:21,440
Scott: - why am I doing this thing if the room is so small?

366
00:18:24,483 --> 00:18:25,459
Rym: Because I got to get the word out.

367
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:34,779
Rym: I mean, even at PAX, where like I think 80% of the people who go to our panels go to them only because they know it's not doing them, there's always at least one person who's like, "Who the fuck are these guys?

368
00:18:35,321 --> 00:18:38,646
Rym: Why are all these people weirdly excited about them, and can I get my money back for my

369
00:18:38,686 --> 00:18:39,068
Rym: badge?".

370
00:18:42,741 --> 00:18:48,780
Rym: And the only other silver line -- oh, yeah, so my thing of the day was the dice thing, where I did the meta -- I'm distracted, obviously.

371
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,899
Scott: You're in the meta moment right now.

372
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:55,000
Rym: Any other meta other than follow our YouTube channels, follow the other stuff we might be doing, and stay strong.

373
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:57,638
Rym: I can't believe we didn't do a show on this.

374
00:18:59,203 --> 00:19:00,499
Scott: I also don't believe that.

375
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:09,958
Rym: Scott legit did not believe me and spent a while trying to prove me wrong when I said we've never done a show on wallets, and I do not fault him for that because I would not have believed me.

376
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:15,479
Rym: But I was literally -- when Thursday shows come around, you'll know what our process is for figuring out the show.

377
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:26,497
Rym: Scott's at work, and I'm at work, and I'm sitting at my desk, and I literally look around the room and start typing nouns that I see into the chat, and then Scott one by one says, "Those are all terrible ideas for

378
00:19:26,517 --> 00:19:26,819
Rym: shows.".

379
00:19:27,403 --> 00:19:29,760
Rym: And my wallet happened to be on my desk, and I was like, "Wallets?

380
00:19:30,765 --> 00:19:31,572
Rym: I don't think we've done a show on

381
00:19:31,612 --> 00:19:31,935
Rym: wallets.".

382
00:19:32,682 --> 00:19:34,640
Rym: In fact, I couldn't even find a show on The Jimmy.

383
00:19:34,721 --> 00:19:40,940
Rym: And I remember we talked about The Jimmy so much that the company that made The Jimmy actually found us and gave us free Jimmys.

384
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:42,685
Rym: Remember that?

385
00:19:42,705 --> 00:19:43,918
Rym: That was a long time ago.

386
00:19:45,363 --> 00:19:46,517
Rym: So the Jimmy wallet, of course, is gone.

387
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,740
Rym: That company, as far as I can tell, is gone.

388
00:19:50,184 --> 00:19:51,220
Rym: And I guess we're talking about wallets.

389
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:52,393
Scott: Yeah.

390
00:19:54,562 --> 00:19:56,180
Rym: So big wallet or small wallet?

391
00:19:57,442 --> 00:20:04,240
Scott: I mean, when I was originally getting wallets, right, this was back in the day before there was even real internet or internet shopping or anything.

392
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:15,199
Scott: So my idea of a wallet was the only kind of wallet I'd ever seen in my life, which was a wallet that folds in the middle, has a place to put money, and then a bunch of card slots and even a photo thingy.

393
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,680
Scott: I felt like I had to get photos and put them in, right, because it comes with the stupid photo thing.

394
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:22,780
Scott: That's the only image I ever had of a wallet in my mind.

395
00:20:23,321 --> 00:20:28,500
Scott: So when I needed one, I went to the department store, like Macy's or whatever.

396
00:20:29,404 --> 00:20:31,498
Scott: And there's that rack of -- They had a whole bunch of them.

397
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,620
Rym: Black and brown leather men's bi-fold or tri-fold wallets.

398
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:39,519
Scott: Yeah, and I would buy a bi-fold one that -- I always did the tri-fold.

399
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:44,979
Scott: The most, you know, normal-looking-ish -- Oh, the ones that has the extra up-flip.

400
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,076
Rym: Yep, it goes buh-bup.

401
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:49,380
Rym: So you open it halfway, and you can get, like, your cards out.

402
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,580
Scott: Yeah, I think I got that kind of one.

403
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:57,479
Rym: And then you open it all the way, and the ID is sitting there, because when you're, like, that's the age where you actually have to show an ID a lot for stuff.

404
00:20:57,991 --> 00:20:58,159
Rym: Yep.

405
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,360
Rym: Just in general, like, bus passes or whatever, because you're a kid.

406
00:21:01,782 --> 00:21:05,000
Rym: And you use your driver's license, and you're excited about having a driver's license.

407
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,826
Scott: And so I just -- I had that kind of wallet.

408
00:21:06,947 --> 00:21:11,739
Scott: always until, like, even in college, I had that kind of wallet, and I would lose it.

409
00:21:12,881 --> 00:21:13,484
Rym: Wow.

410
00:21:13,504 --> 00:21:17,020
Rym: I only ever lost my wallet once in my entire life.

411
00:21:17,584 --> 00:21:18,659
Scott: I've lost it two times.

412
00:21:19,161 --> 00:21:21,069
Rym: And, actually, I lost it.

413
00:21:21,531 --> 00:21:23,420
Rym: I canceled all my cards and, like, did all the stuff.

414
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,780
Rym: This was in high school, ninth grade.

415
00:21:25,301 --> 00:21:32,115
Rym: And then, literally, like, four days later, a friend of mine in high school was like, "Oh, by the way, I found your wallet in the woods

416
00:21:32,196 --> 00:21:32,437
Rym: here.".

417
00:21:33,741 --> 00:21:35,019
Rym: Literally found it in the woods.

418
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,400
Scott: I think -- I lost two.

419
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:43,620
Scott: One, I was in Israel, and I had -- I think I put it in a bathing suit pocket.

420
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:44,900
Rym: That's dangerous.

421
00:21:45,761 --> 00:21:48,018
Scott: No, I wasn't -- this was, like, after --.

422
00:21:48,421 --> 00:21:48,945
Rym: Oh, I know, I know.

423
00:21:48,965 --> 00:21:55,680
Rym: I'm just saying, the danger of the bathing suit pocket is, one, those pockets suck, and it's really easy to fall out, and, two, you might forget it's there and go back in the water.

424
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,163
Scott: No.

425
00:21:56,304 --> 00:22:01,578
Scott: This was not at a water -- I had it, and we were already back at the temporary hoe hostel.

426
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:02,878
Rym: Okay, okay.

427
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:11,580
Scott: And I took a shower, and the bathing suit was, like, on the floor or hanging with the wallet in it while I was showering.

428
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,412
Scott: It was a one-person bathroom.

429
00:22:13,473 --> 00:22:15,260
Scott: It wasn't, like, some -- Oh, did someone take the wallet?

430
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:22,140
Scott: I don't know, but, like, that's where I remembered it being, and the next time I went for it, it knew there.

431
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:22,702
Rym: Oh.

432
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:31,520
Scott: And this next time that I lost a wallet was at RIT, and I'm pretty sure I left it on the DDR machine at the Putt-Putt.

433
00:22:31,861 --> 00:22:33,099
Rym: I remember that.

434
00:22:33,681 --> 00:22:35,039
Scott: And then it was not there.

435
00:22:35,421 --> 00:22:36,660
Rym: Because we drove back over there.

436
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,099
Scott: Which is why my anime club membership cards only go so far back.

437
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:44,380
Scott: They don't go any farther back than that, and since then, I have not lost a wallet.

438
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:48,300
Scott: I've only replaced highly damaged wallets and such.

439
00:22:48,641 --> 00:22:55,500
Rym: So I had this weird point of pride where I had this trifold wallet, and I always got the simplest, smooth, black leather one.

440
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,860
Rym: Like, never any other color, never any adornment of any kind.

441
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:00,760
Scott: I would get the simplest, smoothest, brown leather one.

442
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:08,300
Rym: Before I had credit cards, I had all this shit that I kept in my wallet, and then thinking back -- I also kept a bunch of shit in there.

443
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:14,420
Rym: Like, I can't picture individually what all those things were, but I remember there being all these different cards in there.

444
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:19,060
Scott: Basically, there's a whole -- I know what the cards are, because I now keep those cards in the drawer of my desk.

445
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,080
Rym: Oh, you know where I keep mine?

446
00:23:20,221 --> 00:23:22,820
Rym: I have my old Jimmy wallet that's broken.

447
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:23,699
Scott: Oh, you put it in there?

448
00:23:24,561 --> 00:23:28,460
Rym: All my extra, like, second-tier shit is in that backup wallet.

449
00:23:29,101 --> 00:23:34,874
Scott: So things that I would keep in old wallets that I no longer keep are things like photos, right?

450
00:23:34,934 --> 00:23:35,720
Scott: No one does that anymore.

451
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:40,160
Rym: I used to carry my Social Security card around for some reason, because I was just stupid, so now that's in a vault.

452
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,440
Scott: I've never kept that in -- I keep that in my house.

453
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,517
Rym: Well, my wallet -- I don't lose my wallet, so...

454
00:23:44,982 --> 00:23:46,011
Scott: Yeah, but even so, right?

455
00:23:46,031 --> 00:23:47,020
Scott: There's no reason to carry it around.

456
00:23:47,246 --> 00:23:47,760
Rym: Not anymore.

457
00:23:48,721 --> 00:23:57,040
Scott: I would keep -- for example, like, I'd get a rewards card somewhere, and then I'd actually -- like, I had a media -- My Funko Land card.

458
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,460
Scott: For example, like, a media play card, which we used to have, right?

459
00:23:59,460 --> 00:23:59,528
Scott: Yup.

460
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,620
Scott: And I would just always have it with me.

461
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,269
Scott: It's like, but now I have --.

462
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:06,240
Scott: the only rewards card I really have now is, like, the Rite Aid card.

463
00:24:06,401 --> 00:24:07,579
Rym: I just got my phone number in.

464
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:12,100
Scott: Well, I actually got a -- I give them, like, a fake deal, right?

465
00:24:12,342 --> 00:24:12,877
Scott: So it's not --.

466
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,654
Rym: Well, when I say my phone number, I mean 867-5309, which totally works.

467
00:24:17,182 --> 00:24:20,320
Scott: Oh, I didn't give them -- I gave them -- I don't remember the fake number I gave them.

468
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:24,998
Rym: I just put in -- I literally put in 212-867-5309 every time, and it totally works.

469
00:24:26,941 --> 00:24:28,190
Scott: Oh, no, that song is 364-5789.

470
00:24:30,146 --> 00:24:30,300
Scott: Anyway.

471
00:24:31,241 --> 00:24:32,780
Scott: So, yeah, I don't remember the number I gave them.

472
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,260
Scott: So, like -- but that card, I don't carry around with me everywhere.

473
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:38,659
Scott: I just leave it in my drawer, and if I'm going to Rite Aid, I bring it with me.

474
00:24:39,107 --> 00:24:39,258
Rym: Yup.

475
00:24:39,843 --> 00:24:41,334
Scott: I wish I could just use my phone to do it.

476
00:24:41,455 --> 00:24:46,240
Rym: I don't need the stupid -- So, a card I had -- the thing is, in the old days, like, if you didn't have your card, like, you were fine.

477
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:52,599
Scott: Like, you needed the card to get the thing, but now -- Well, at least when I was in Connecticut, there was some kind of law where they couldn't make you have the card.

478
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:53,095
Scott: Ooh.

479
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,960
Scott: You could just -- I don't know if that's still true or -- I don't know.

480
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,420
Rym: Because, like, I have the REI card.

481
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,819
Scott: Someone out there, tell me.

482
00:24:59,041 --> 00:25:03,019
Rym: Because the REI thing is actually, like, if you're a sports person, is a really good deal.

483
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,880
Scott: But isn't REI, in general, a rip-off?

484
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,400
Scott: You could just buy from Amazon and probably save just as much money.

485
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:07,783
Rym: Nah.

486
00:25:07,804 --> 00:25:08,640
Rym: Depends on what you're buying.

487
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:20,135
Rym: Like, if I'm getting ski boots that I need to try on in person, and then I'm getting form-fitted to my foot, if I'm getting clothes that I need to try on because they're highly specialized, and, actually, their prices are really good.

488
00:25:22,941 --> 00:25:24,760
Rym: You're thinking of, like, generic sportsy stuff.

489
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,019
Rym: I'm talking, like, specific specialized gear, like bindings for skis and shit.

490
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,080
Scott: Yeah, I don't buy that.

491
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:36,134
Rym: But, anyway, the way it works is you pay some trivial amount of money, and you remember if they're, like, co-op -- We don't need any REI advertising.

492
00:25:36,195 --> 00:25:36,740
Scott: Talk about wallets.

493
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,960
Rym: I know, but anyway, the card's really good, and it's saved me a crazy shit ton of money.

494
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,439
Scott: But you don't carry it with you all the time.

495
00:25:42,601 --> 00:25:43,206
Scott: Nope.

496
00:25:43,226 --> 00:25:44,780
Rym: I don't -- You know where that is?

497
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:48,514
Rym: It's sitting in my Jimmy wallet, because if I go to the store, they're just like, "What's your

498
00:25:48,534 --> 00:25:48,779
Rym: name?".

499
00:25:48,921 --> 00:25:50,240
Rym: And then they look me up, and it's all good.

500
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,900
Scott: So, now, since the Jimmy times, I don't use a Jimmy anymore.

501
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:58,160
Scott: I usually go on Kickstarter and find some tiny wallet, like the tiniest, slimmest wallet I can find.

502
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,280
Rym: That is what I have done.

503
00:25:59,461 --> 00:26:03,160
Rym: I have bought so many Kickstarter wallets, and they've all been great.

504
00:26:03,881 --> 00:26:06,700
Rym: Then they wore out, and then there's no way to get another one.

505
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,480
Scott: I go on Kickstarter and find another tiny wallet.

506
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,840
Scott: So the one I have right now is August brand.

507
00:26:11,101 --> 00:26:12,360
Rym: I don't know what mine is called.

508
00:26:12,422 --> 00:26:13,139
Scott: It's like the month.

509
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:19,520
Scott: And basically, what it is, is on both sides, there's, like, a little sort of, like, pouch almost.

510
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:23,819
Scott: And on one side is my MetroCard, and then the other side is some cash that's folded up.

511
00:26:24,442 --> 00:26:28,859
Scott: And then in the middle, there's a little thing you can pull, and you pull it, and all the cards come out.

512
00:26:29,742 --> 00:26:31,253
Rym: I have the slim wallet.

513
00:26:31,314 --> 00:26:32,140
Rym: It's just called the slim wallet.

514
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,919
Scott: Yours looks very similar in mechanism to mine with the boop.

515
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:35,404
Rym: Yep.

516
00:26:35,651 --> 00:26:35,815
Rym: Boop.

517
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,600
Scott: But yours only has a pouch on one side.

518
00:26:37,861 --> 00:26:39,260
Scott: Mine -- Yours has a clip on one side.

519
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,520
Rym: It has a pouch on one side and a money clip on the other side.

520
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,920
Scott: Mine has a pouch and a pouch.

521
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,379
Rym: And the money clip is carbon fiber.

522
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,120
Rym: I can fit, like, 400 bucks in here if I need to.

523
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,900
Scott: Yeah, that actually might be slightly better than mine.

524
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:49,951
Scott: No, you know why it's better?

525
00:26:49,971 --> 00:26:50,660
Scott: You know why it's better?

526
00:26:51,002 --> 00:26:52,014
Scott: I have to fold the money.

527
00:26:52,136 --> 00:26:52,460
Scott: You don't.

528
00:26:52,781 --> 00:26:53,640
Scott: I don't have to fold it.

529
00:26:54,324 --> 00:26:55,880
Scott: And I think yours can hold more money.

530
00:26:56,221 --> 00:26:58,060
Rym: Like I said, you can fit 400 bucks in this thing.

531
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,311
Scott: Yeah.

532
00:26:58,641 --> 00:27:02,680
Rym: And that's right behind the money, is where I put the key to get into a hotel room.

533
00:27:02,761 --> 00:27:06,460
Rym: so I can boop, boop, because all the rest of this thing is RFID blocking.

534
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,640
Scott: So here's the cards I have in the wallet.

535
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:10,480
Rym: Oh, yeah, let's go through it.

536
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,740
Rym: I got a credit card.

537
00:27:12,021 --> 00:27:13,600
Rym: I have the main credit card.

538
00:27:13,943 --> 00:27:14,618
Scott: The ATM card.

539
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,719
Rym: Backup credit card.

540
00:27:16,362 --> 00:27:18,340
Scott: The backup credit card is in my dress drawer.

541
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,638
Rym: I have ATM card.

542
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:20,200
Scott: Yep.

543
00:27:20,443 --> 00:27:20,900
Rym: Metro card.

544
00:27:21,262 --> 00:27:22,460
Scott: Metro card is in the pouch-y part.

545
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,080
Rym: It's in the pouch-y part.

546
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:23,859
Rym: Healthcare card.

547
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:24,600
Scott: Yep, I got that.

548
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,300
Rym: Which covers dental and medical.

549
00:27:26,862 --> 00:27:31,300
Scott: For dental, I need the separate flimsy piece of paper, but I have both of those cards, basically.

550
00:27:32,441 --> 00:27:34,520
Rym: Old by multiple generations.

551
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,840
Rym: New York State driver's license.

552
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,600
Scott: Yeah, I also have driver's license.

553
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,919
Scott: And the picture on it, I have hair.

554
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:40,180
Rym: Wow, yours is newer.

555
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,838
Rym: Look how fucking beat up an old mine is.

556
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:42,856
Scott: When does yours expire?

557
00:27:42,876 --> 00:27:43,060
Scott: yet?

558
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,920
Rym: Mine expires next year, actually.

559
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:49,880
Scott: Mine expires in 2018.

560
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,400
Scott: So two years.

561
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,420
Rym: And then I have business credit card, because I use it actually a lot.

562
00:27:53,962 --> 00:27:55,339
Scott: I have the laundry card.

563
00:27:56,205 --> 00:27:57,180
Scott: Oh, I just used quarters.

564
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,079
Scott: I used to keep the laundry card.

565
00:27:59,462 --> 00:28:00,860
Rym: Oh, and I have second Metro card.

566
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:01,720
Rym: This is the cash card.

567
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,559
Rym: I only use one of mine.

568
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,999
Scott: My second Metro card's in my messenger bag.

569
00:28:04,341 --> 00:28:05,880
Rym: My second Metro card, I just keep it with me.

570
00:28:06,201 --> 00:28:07,340
Scott: I only use it for AirTrain.

571
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,399
Rym: AirTrain, occasionally Path.

572
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:10,839
Scott: I don't take the Path.

573
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,099
Rym: I occasionally do, because I have business in Jersey.

574
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:13,860
Scott: I'm not going there.

575
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:21,599
Scott: I got the laundry card, and I was keeping the laundry card out of the wallet, but then I lost the laundry card, so in the wallet it doesn't get lost.

576
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,859
Scott: Yeah, that makes sense.

577
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,780
Scott: And then I have two RFID door opening cards.

578
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:30,840
Scott: One opens the entrance to the office building, and one opens our office.

579
00:28:31,063 --> 00:28:31,438
Scott: Let's see.

580
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:36,180
Scott: So I can get into the office building at night after it closes and the doormat is not there anymore.

581
00:28:36,301 --> 00:28:37,089
Rym: Oh, and I have $45 in cash.

582
00:28:38,601 --> 00:28:39,658
Scott: Oh, how much can I -- Just right now.

583
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:40,939
Rym: That's just what happens to be in here.

584
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,500
Scott: I have 20, 40, 60, 80.

585
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,619
Rym: Because you don't keep the ones in that wallet.

586
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:48,940
Scott: I have $80, and then all the ones are in my messenger bag.

587
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,779
Rym: See, I can actually -- I put the ones in here.

588
00:28:51,723 --> 00:28:52,340
Rym: Oh, my God.

589
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,540
Rym: Does that prevent the one problem from building up?

590
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,680
Rym: Because I actually use them, like, regularly.

591
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,480
Rym: I don't have a why.

592
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,700
Scott: But the thing is, having the fistful of ones can actually be useful at certain times.

593
00:29:00,841 --> 00:29:03,559
Rym: I use it at, like, if I -- If we go out to have dinner with friends.

594
00:29:03,881 --> 00:29:05,199
Scott: If I go to a cash-only place.

595
00:29:05,683 --> 00:29:07,980
Rym: Yeah, I increasingly try to boycott cash-only places.

596
00:29:08,442 --> 00:29:13,400
Scott: One time, I was buying some -- just, like, two slices of pizza, right?

597
00:29:13,861 --> 00:29:15,920
Scott: And it was, like, $3.50 or something.

598
00:29:16,741 --> 00:29:21,480
Rym: So I bring out -- Well, downtown, the place I get pizza at, it's $7.45 to get two slices of pizza.

599
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,219
Scott: This is in Astoria.

600
00:29:22,626 --> 00:29:22,755
Scott: Okay.

601
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,998
Scott: At the Chubby's Garbage Place under my -- Oh, okay, okay, okay.

602
00:29:26,401 --> 00:29:34,599
Scott: And I pull out my fistful of ones, and the guy's, like -- the guy sees my ones, and I couldn't understand what he was saying at first, but he wanted my ones.

603
00:29:34,841 --> 00:29:38,000
Scott: So I counted him 20 ones, and he gave me a 20.

604
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,485
Scott: And I was like, "All

605
00:29:38,525 --> 00:29:38,848
Scott: right.".

606
00:29:40,161 --> 00:29:41,452
Scott: Because he's like, "He needed the ones.

607
00:29:41,492 --> 00:29:41,794
Scott: He was a

608
00:29:41,835 --> 00:29:42,157
Scott: store.".

609
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,597
Scott: So the other thing you can do with the pile of ones is go to an ATM and shove them in.

610
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:48,998
Scott: Right?

611
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,132
Scott: So you can be like -- Maybe you got 70 ones.

612
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:57,500
Scott: You shove them in there, and then you withdraw 50 bucks, and it's like, "Hey, I just increased my checking account.

613
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:57,788
Scott: Great.".

614
00:29:58,061 --> 00:30:01,559
Rym: Oh, so the other benefit of this one is that the money clip has this little ridge sticking out of it.

615
00:30:01,784 --> 00:30:02,178
Scott: I see that.

616
00:30:02,402 --> 00:30:04,459
Rym: And what that's for is to -- That actually looks not good.

617
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:07,431
Rym: No, so I thought that when I first came, I was like, "Oh, this is going to be a

618
00:30:07,452 --> 00:30:07,778
Rym: problem.".

619
00:30:08,143 --> 00:30:10,658
Rym: If you put it with the ridge face in your butt, you literally don't feel it.

620
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,600
Scott: Oh, so you put the wallet in the back pocket.

621
00:30:12,969 --> 00:30:13,140
Scott: Yeah.

622
00:30:13,321 --> 00:30:14,400
Scott: I put it in the front pocket.

623
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,960
Rym: I've never -- front pocket wallet is garbage tier.

624
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:22,640
Scott: Front -- What I do -- Rear wallet, first of all, you're sitting on something.

625
00:30:22,842 --> 00:30:23,840
Rym: It's poking you in the butt.

626
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,660
Scott: You're also unbalancing your ass.

627
00:30:26,143 --> 00:30:27,720
Scott: Is one ass cheek smaller than the other?

628
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,779
Scott: You put it on the small cheek?

629
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:29,480
Rym: Look where it sits.

630
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:33,220
Rym: It's so small and so slim that it sits to the left of the butt bone.

631
00:30:34,047 --> 00:30:35,600
Scott: You sit on the edge of your chair like that?

632
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,157
Scott: No, even here.

633
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,280
Rym: My butt's not on it.

634
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:37,500
Rym: Look.

635
00:30:38,242 --> 00:30:39,100
Rym: See the outline of the wallet?

636
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,360
Scott: I see where you put it, and I guess that's true.

637
00:30:42,781 --> 00:30:43,799
Rym: All my jeans are like that.

638
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:47,839
Rym: By design, I don't wear pants where the back pocket wallet doesn't work.

639
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,380
Scott: But I put it in the front right pocket.

640
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,660
Scott: What do you put in your front right pocket?

641
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,799
Rym: Front right pocket is phone.

642
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:53,979
Rym: Front left pocket is keys.

643
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,612
Rym: Right now, back --.

644
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,960
Scott: Oh, see, front right pocket is wallet.

645
00:30:58,161 --> 00:30:59,640
Scott: Front left pocket is phone.

646
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,399
Rym: Where do you put your keys?

647
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,398
Scott: Keys somewhere else.

648
00:31:01,782 --> 00:31:02,798
Rym: Ah, no, because I don't carry my bag.

649
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:03,820
Rym: I carry my bag all the time.

650
00:31:04,483 --> 00:31:14,939
Scott: Well, if I have to take my keys out of my bag, I put them in with the wallet or in a coat pocket, if I'm wearing a coat, or -- I don't like having anything -- Oh, and the key pocket is where any extraneous change goes.

651
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:15,545
Rym: Mm-hmm.

652
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,600
Rym: Because I don't want that banging around against my phone.

653
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,660
Scott: Yeah, never put anything metal in the phone pocket.

654
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:21,118
Scott: Yes.

655
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,391
Rym: That is an egregious offense.

656
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:27,259
Scott: My boss, he's like, "My phone's all scratched

657
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:27,359
Scott: up.".

658
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,138
Scott: And I'm like, "Do you put your keys in with your

659
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:29,360
Scott: phone?".

660
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:29,772
Scott: And he's like,

661
00:31:29,793 --> 00:31:29,896
Scott: "Yeah.".

662
00:31:30,061 --> 00:31:31,179
Scott: And I'm like, "Duh.

663
00:31:32,361 --> 00:31:34,959
Scott: Don't put anything in with your phone pocket except your

664
00:31:34,979 --> 00:31:35,080
Scott: phone.".

665
00:31:35,142 --> 00:31:35,620
Rym: It's like my face hurts.

666
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,660
Rym: Do you keep scraping it with sandpaper?

667
00:31:39,641 --> 00:31:41,140
Scott: Oh, that must be it.

668
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:50,060
Rym: But anyway, the ridge does not cause any bother at all, no matter what direction it's facing, but it means you can stick your finger in and very easily pull the wallet out of even, tight pants.

669
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,920
Scott: Ah, easy for the pickpocket to pull it out of your pants.

670
00:31:53,142 --> 00:31:54,400
Rym: Ah, because I wear such tight pants.

671
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,880
Rym: I've actually thought about that a lot.

672
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:07,320
Rym: So when I'm on the subway, if I'm wearing pants where someone could conceivably get my wallet out pickpocket style, I move it to the front left pocket with the keys until I'm off the subway.

673
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:10,700
Scott: I've thought about getting an ostentatious fake rear pocket wallet.

674
00:32:10,881 --> 00:32:12,456
Rym: Ooh, it's just full of like explosions.

675
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,136
Scott: Yeah, full of like, you know.

676
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:15,898
Rym: Skunk juice.

677
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,180
Scott: Contact poison.

678
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,458
Rym: Ampules of skunk juice.

679
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:19,459
Scott: Just whatever, right?

680
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,639
Scott: Because I mean, it's not really a concern in New York.

681
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:33,060
Scott: Despite New York being a huge city, it's probably in terms of like, it's not saying there's no pickpocketing in New York City, but pickpocketing per person in New York City is probably the lowest of any major city.

682
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:39,660
Scott: Like the stories I hear, never having been there, is that like Paris is like pickpocket central, right?

683
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:49,740
Scott: And I've never heard anyone, like when I've said that, maybe, you know, when I've, uh, when I've propagated that rumor, people have not said, that's just a stereotype.

684
00:32:49,923 --> 00:32:50,538
Scott: It's not true.

685
00:32:51,141 --> 00:32:53,880
Scott: They've said, oh, they said, yes, very true.

686
00:32:54,061 --> 00:32:54,920
Scott: Watch out when you're right.

687
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:00,780
Scott: So, um, so like I imagined I would use it if I was traveling in such a place.

688
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,640
Rym: So I like this wallet a lot, but I liked the wallet I had before better.

689
00:33:05,185 --> 00:33:06,319
Rym: It was even more minimalist.

690
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:10,179
Rym: It was just this like metal wire with some leather around it.

691
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:12,880
Rym: And I held all my cards in the middle so I could flip them up with my thumb.

692
00:33:13,322 --> 00:33:15,500
Rym: And the rest of the wire on the back was a money clip.

693
00:33:16,042 --> 00:33:19,200
Rym: And it was seriously like four millimeters thinner than even this thing.

694
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:20,719
Rym: And this thing is real fucking thin.

695
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,460
Rym: But it eventually wore out and it was a Kickstarter project.

696
00:33:24,582 --> 00:33:25,300
Rym: So I can't get it again.

697
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,899
Scott: The one I have now is slightly wearing out.

698
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:28,512
Rym: Yup.

699
00:33:29,221 --> 00:33:31,559
Rym: So before this, I used the Jimmy X.

700
00:33:32,463 --> 00:33:32,755
Scott: Me too.

701
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,260
Rym: Which back then, like there wasn't a Kickstarter.

702
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:39,920
Rym: The Jimmy was literally the only like modern wallet on earth as far as I could tell.

703
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:44,780
Rym: And right when Kickstarter started, there were like 40 different wallet projects.

704
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,959
Rym: They were all kind of garbage.

705
00:33:47,660 --> 00:34:04,179
Rym: Uh, so I used that trifold for the longest time, but when I switched out of it was when we got the Jimmy, because the trifold is actually inferior to the bifold, but my dumb kid brain didn't realize at the time, because it makes it substantially thicker in your pocket unless you don't carry any cash ever.

706
00:34:05,882 --> 00:34:08,219
Rym: And a thick wallet is not a thing I can deal with.

707
00:34:08,842 --> 00:34:10,619
Rym: I don't understand the people of the wallet where you open it.

708
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:16,500
Rym: And then inside there's like more divisions in the top so you can like separate different kinds of bills.

709
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,045
Scott: Yeah.

710
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:23,719
Rym: Or the people who have the full on bill fold that has like all the cards arrayed in this like deck.

711
00:34:24,283 --> 00:34:25,672
Scott: I mean, back in the day, right?

712
00:34:25,732 --> 00:34:27,878
Scott: It was the best because like, well, you had a million cards.

713
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:28,241
Scott: Right.

714
00:34:28,261 --> 00:34:29,268
Scott: Well, no, even more.

715
00:34:29,309 --> 00:34:36,000
Scott: back in the day, like my grandfather, he would like, he owned the mechanic and he was a mechanic and no fucking credit cards, right?

716
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,599
Scott: It's like he just had a cash clip and that was it.

717
00:34:39,681 --> 00:34:41,719
Scott: Money, money, money, just cash, tons of it.

718
00:34:42,181 --> 00:34:42,404
Scott: Right.

719
00:34:42,465 --> 00:34:43,779
Scott: And that's what we carry around.

720
00:34:44,681 --> 00:34:45,469
Scott: That was it.

721
00:34:45,974 --> 00:34:46,338
Scott: Nothing else.

722
00:34:46,862 --> 00:34:46,949
Rym: Yeah.

723
00:34:48,202 --> 00:34:50,260
Rym: So, but I'm pretty much all I want now is super minimal.

724
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:59,060
Rym: And maybe seven years ago, I wouldn't have considered this a concern, but you probably should get a wallet that blocks RFID in the modern era.

725
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,799
Scott: There are multiple, I mean, there's no negative to having it.

726
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,109
Rym: Yup.

727
00:35:03,722 --> 00:35:17,060
Rym: And there are multiple demonstrated proofs of concept of doing such shit as taking a contact, like basically a point of sale system and just walking up behind someone and charging their credit card through their pocket.

728
00:35:17,202 --> 00:35:18,339
Rym: Like you can totally do that.

729
00:35:20,303 --> 00:35:21,795
Rym: So, yeah, I feel like that is worth it.

730
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,619
Rym: I don't know what else we can say.

731
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:33,900
Scott: I mean, I'm looking at the currently available wallets on Kickstarter and it's like there's so many of them and some of them are serviceable and some of them are right out.

732
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:37,020
Rym: You can just buy, because you know who makes the Slim Wallet?

733
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,980
Rym: The same people who make that Trackline belt that we have.

734
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,234
Rym: The thing is, like even some of these buyfolds.

735
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,060
Rym: Look, all they make is that belt, that wallet.

736
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,081
Scott: Sure.

737
00:35:45,182 --> 00:35:53,358
Scott: Even some of these buyfold ones I'm seeing on Kickstarter are like actually probably usable because they're so slim, even though they're fold.

738
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:53,688
Rym: True.

739
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:54,321
Scott: Right?

740
00:35:54,362 --> 00:35:56,960
Scott: It's like as long as you don't put a fucking shit ton of money in there.

741
00:35:57,382 --> 00:35:57,544
Scott: Right?

742
00:35:57,584 --> 00:35:59,200
Scott: I could probably deal with one of those, right?

743
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:02,999
Scott: So, you know, this one is slowly wearing out, like a string came off of it the other day.

744
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:03,534
Scott: Yup.

745
00:36:04,042 --> 00:36:06,260
Scott: So, you know, when it wears out, we'll see what I go for.

746
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:12,759
Scott: I might try one of these ones that's made of metal or really, I mean, you can get by with like a rubber band.

747
00:36:13,221 --> 00:36:17,080
Scott: I also have coworkers that use like that Invincible Wallet.

748
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,160
Scott: that's basically just like a folded up piece of Tyvek.

749
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,447
Rym: Oh, I've seen that.

750
00:36:21,689 --> 00:36:23,080
Rym: That thing's actually moderately cool.

751
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:27,860
Scott: Yeah, it's like it's just a normal buyfold wallet, but it's like basically invincible.

752
00:36:28,723 --> 00:36:29,589
Rym: You know what that's good for?

753
00:36:29,609 --> 00:36:39,580
Rym: I know some people who use that, like if they're going on like extreme sports stuff and they bring a wallet with them, they use that instead of their regular wallet to not get the regular wallet all stanky.

754
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:40,282
Scott: Right.

755
00:36:40,322 --> 00:36:41,151
Scott: It's like, you know, it's...

756
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,117
Rym: Leather wallets eventually smell like ass.

757
00:36:45,923 --> 00:36:48,560
Rym: Like that eventually happens unless you don't sweat.

758
00:36:48,908 --> 00:36:49,280
Rym: It's leather.

759
00:36:49,872 --> 00:36:49,960
Rym: Yeah.

760
00:36:50,521 --> 00:36:54,192
Scott: But I hope you don't sweat so much that it goes through your pants and into your wallet.

761
00:36:54,213 --> 00:36:54,660
Scott: That'd be weird.

762
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,360
Rym: Sometimes it's just hot out and I'm wearing shorts and I'm sitting next to my wallet like, eh.

763
00:36:59,122 --> 00:36:59,678
Scott: That doesn't happen.

764
00:37:00,542 --> 00:37:01,659
Rym: But so do you do the thing?

765
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:15,839
Rym: When I travel to certain kinds of events or like certain kinds of things I'll do, I will basically go to the Minimal Wallet where I will, because I have another crapo wallet and I'll bring like less stuff with me.

766
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,300
Rym: Like I bring a different wallet configuration.

767
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,060
Scott: The only time I do that is in a water situation.

768
00:37:22,764 --> 00:37:23,894
Scott: If I go to the water park...

769
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,919
Rym: I bring the jimmy, the old jimmy.

770
00:37:26,341 --> 00:37:32,080
Scott: I can use the jimmy, but what I used to do before the jimmy days at the water park is I had this plastic tube on a string.

771
00:37:32,643 --> 00:37:33,619
Rym: I remember that tube.

772
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,980
Scott: And I would open the plastic tube on a string.

773
00:37:36,303 --> 00:37:38,732
Rym: I remember specifically you having that tube when we were at RIT.

774
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:46,180
Scott: And I would shove money in the plastic tube on a string and then you screw it tight and you wear it around your neck.

775
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:59,899
Scott: And now you can ride a water slide with money on you and you can get off the water slide and buy a hot dog, eat the hot dog, not have to put their wallet in the not very secure locker at the water park.

776
00:38:00,242 --> 00:38:06,220
Scott: And also you put the key to the not very secure locker at the water park in the plastic tube and all your stuff is in the locker.

777
00:38:06,721 --> 00:38:10,616
Scott: You know, it's also good at the beach if you don't want to leave your wallet on the sand.

778
00:38:11,521 --> 00:38:21,279
Scott: You can just leave your towel on the sand and bring your monies with you so that you can buy ice cream or a fudgy wudgy without having to leave your money in an unsafe position unattended.

779
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,979
Rym: Now what I don't understand are the people who use the wallet.

780
00:38:25,162 --> 00:38:26,618
Rym: that is also a cell phone case.

781
00:38:29,346 --> 00:38:30,360
Scott: I can go for that.

782
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,800
Rym: I mean it's too big to put in any reasonable pocket.

783
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,619
Rym: It seems like most people who do that carry a purse or a bag of some kind.

784
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:40,079
Scott: If I found, you know, if it accommodated the thing is I don't want a case on my phone.

785
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:41,640
Scott: In general.

786
00:38:42,402 --> 00:38:44,900
Scott: You know, I could save a whole pocket doing that.

787
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,939
Scott: I see the appeal.

788
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:57,779
Rym: Yeah, but at the same time, the problem is if I lose my wallet between Android Pay and all the capabilities of a modern smartphone I could get home.

789
00:38:58,162 --> 00:38:58,939
Rym: I could deal with shit.

790
00:38:59,241 --> 00:39:04,300
Rym: And if I lose my phone, my wallet guarantees that I can at least make it back to my house.

791
00:39:04,641 --> 00:39:07,178
Rym: If I lose both, what the fuck am I going to do?

792
00:39:07,444 --> 00:39:11,179
Scott: But here's one, that's true, but here's the thing.

793
00:39:11,821 --> 00:39:14,880
Scott: You could use Find My iPhone to find your wallet.

794
00:39:15,982 --> 00:39:16,918
Rym: Yeah, I guess you could.

795
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:26,578
Scott: However, the major problem is if I'm sitting there using my phone I've got all these credit cards just hanging out.

796
00:39:28,485 --> 00:39:29,280
Scott: That's not a good situation.

797
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,259
Rym: Like on the way home today, right?

798
00:39:30,741 --> 00:39:33,320
Scott: I'm just showing all my cash is sticking out.

799
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:37,219
Rym: Today I was reading Squirrel Girl, but yesterday I was reading this Wikipedia article on the way home.

800
00:39:37,961 --> 00:39:43,780
Rym: So, I'll just hold all my money flimsily in my hand just right there in the middle of the subway.

801
00:39:45,804 --> 00:39:46,659
Scott: Keep that shit away.

802
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,420
Rym: So yeah, wallets.

803
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,500
Scott: I can't believe we didn't do a wallet share.

804
00:39:52,561 --> 00:39:52,904
Rym: I know.

805
00:39:53,288 --> 00:39:56,140
Rym: I feel like that was actually Such a low hanging fruit.

806
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:56,763
Rym: I know.

807
00:39:57,127 --> 00:39:58,580
Rym: I got us by another Thursday.

808
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,340
Rym: So yeah, stay tuned.

809
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,020
Rym: GeekNights is continuing as normal.

810
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,058
Rym: Come see us at GamerX.

811
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:12,358
Rym: And you only seed so much ground to fascists before you start to do the things that need to be done to prevent fascists from doing what they want to do.

812
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,327
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

813
00:40:21,388 --> 00:40:26,360
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

815
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:34,700
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

819
00:40:47,509 --> 00:40:50,400
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

820
00:41:00,392 --> 00:41:18,727

823
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:49,950
Rym: Keep your heads up, take a small step forward every day, and we'll get through this.

824
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:52,569
Rym: And now I leave you with something.

825
00:42:13,733 --> 00:42:15,470
Media: We don't want to hate and despise one another.

826
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:20,850
Media: In this world there's room for everyone and the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone.

827
00:42:21,491 --> 00:42:25,588
Media: The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way.

828
00:42:26,891 --> 00:42:33,830
Media: Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed.

829
00:42:34,753 --> 00:42:37,488
Media: We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in.

830
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:40,488
Media: Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want.

831
00:42:41,277 --> 00:42:44,590
Media: Our knowledge has made us cynical, our cleverness hard and unkind.

832
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:47,497
Media: We think too much and feel too little.

833
00:42:48,246 --> 00:42:50,410
Media: More than machinery, we need humanity.

834
00:42:50,991 --> 00:42:53,890
Media: More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness.

835
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:57,968
Media: Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost.

836
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:01,337
Media: The airplane and the radio have brought us closer together.

837
00:43:01,721 --> 00:43:07,767
Media: The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men, cries out for universal brotherhood, for the unity of us all.

838
00:43:08,496 --> 00:43:19,069
Media: Even now, my voice is reaching millions throughout the world, millions of despairing men, women and little children, victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people.

839
00:43:20,112 --> 00:43:22,899
Media: To those who can hear me, I say, do not despair.

840
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:29,890
Media: The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress.

841
00:43:30,611 --> 00:43:37,229
Media: The hate of men will pass and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people.

842
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:40,688
Media: And so long as men die, liberty will never perish.

843
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:55,430
Media: Soldiers, don't give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you, enslave you, who regiment your lives, tell you what to do, what to think and what to feel, who drill you, diet you, treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder.

844
00:43:56,051 --> 00:44:01,749
Media: Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men, machine men with machine minds and machine hearts.

845
00:44:02,412 --> 00:44:03,370
Media: You are not machines.

846
00:44:03,874 --> 00:44:04,822
Media: You are not cattle.

847
00:44:05,085 --> 00:44:05,387
Media: You are men.

848
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:08,178
Media: You have the love of humanity in your hearts.

849
00:44:08,563 --> 00:44:09,049
Media: You don't hate.

850
00:44:09,611 --> 00:44:12,580
Media: Only the unloved hate, the unloved and the unnatural.

851
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,090
Media: Soldiers, don't fight for slavery.

852
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:16,237
Media: Fight for liberty.

853
00:44:16,581 --> 00:44:23,853
Media: In the seventeenth chapter of Saint Luke, it is written, "The kingdom of God is within man, not one man, nor a group of men, but in all men, in you.

854
00:44:24,156 --> 00:44:29,044
Media: You, the people, have the power, the power to create machines, the power to create happiness.

855
00:44:29,328 --> 00:44:34,890
Media: You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure.

856
00:44:35,391 --> 00:44:38,319
Media: Then, in the name of democracy, let us use that power.

857
00:44:38,561 --> 00:44:39,550
Media: Let us all unite.

858
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:48,238
Media: Let us fight for a new world, a decent world that will give men a chance to work, that will give youth a future and old age a security.

859
00:44:48,622 --> 00:44:52,440
Media: By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power, but they lie.

860
00:44:52,581 --> 00:44:54,157
Media: They do not fulfill that promise.

861
00:44:54,461 --> 00:44:58,870
Media: They never will dictate us free themselves, but they enslave the people.

862
00:44:59,474 --> 00:45:02,198
Rym: Now, let us fight to fulfill that promise.

863
00:45:02,582 --> 00:45:10,019
Media: Let us fight to free the world, to do away with national barriers, to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance.

864
00:45:10,767 --> 00:45:16,869
Media: Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness.

865
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:21,296
Media: Soldiers, in the name of democracy, let us all unite!
