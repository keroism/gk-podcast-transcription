1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:09,480
Scott:

2
00:00:09,221 --> 00:00:13,270
Rym: It's Monday October 3rd 2016.

3
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:19,640
Rym: I'm Rym Scott and this is GeekNights tonight disposing of old technology.

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,796
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:27,403 --> 00:00:28,718
Rym: So I was on a boat the other night.

6
00:00:29,883 --> 00:00:34,220
Rym: Yeah on the other side It was one of you know those party boats that you see going up and down the river in New York sometimes.

7
00:00:34,562 --> 00:00:35,808
Rym: Yeah, so I was on one of those.

8
00:00:35,888 --> 00:00:39,046
Scott: I mean we were on one of those when we went to see the joke Oh concert.

9
00:00:39,126 --> 00:00:43,227
Rym: Yeah, and I was also on one of those when Judith had her bachelorette party.

10
00:00:43,247 --> 00:00:49,610
Scott: I mean they seem to be like an in ex relatively inexpensive, but Moderate party situation that you know.

11
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:53,670
Scott: if you're in New York you're gonna end up on that boat a few times If you're here long enough, I remember one time.

12
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:54,193
Rym: You know we did.

13
00:00:54,213 --> 00:00:55,520
Rym: we went for Judith's thing.

14
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,463
Rym: We went to the boat.

15
00:00:56,583 --> 00:01:00,054
Rym: our boat was technically a Hall and Oates tribute band boat.

16
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:02,081
Scott: was there actually a Hall and Oates tribute band On it?

17
00:01:02,202 --> 00:01:05,736
Rym: yes, and they performed for the entire boat ride, and we didn't.

18
00:01:05,796 --> 00:01:06,780
Scott: I mean Hall and Oates isn't bad?

19
00:01:06,862 --> 00:01:08,824
Rym: Yeah, I mean the music was fine But no one gave a shit about them.

20
00:01:08,904 --> 00:01:16,979
Rym: so like the inside of the boat where they were performing was literally empty and everyone was outside in the beautiful weather Listening to the music piped up so they were playing to an empty room.

21
00:01:17,623 --> 00:01:21,587
Rym: I felt a little bad, but and but while we were getting on the Hall and Oates boat I mean I was this weekend.

22
00:01:21,607 --> 00:01:26,898
Scott: I was at like the tiniest Country fair and you know welcome to our country.

23
00:01:26,938 --> 00:01:30,175
Scott: home Local business has a table place.

24
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:36,917
Scott: yeah There were bands playing to nothing Except like an old person standing there and a kid running around in a circle.

25
00:01:36,937 --> 00:01:43,140
Rym: yeah So uh man bad weather didn't help them when we got on the Holland but Hall and Oates boat way back.

26
00:01:43,281 --> 00:01:49,837
Rym: I remember that as we were getting on our boat There was a boat next to us that was also loading and that boat looked like a much better boat.

27
00:01:49,877 --> 00:01:51,884
Scott: because that boat Boat you listen.

28
00:01:51,965 --> 00:01:54,473
Scott: whenever you get on one of these boats the boat next to you is always.

29
00:01:54,493 --> 00:02:02,208
Scott: in that case unless you're the rich Person with the big is why the rich people who do the yacht thing try to have the biggest yacht And don't like.

30
00:02:02,269 --> 00:02:02,955
Scott: what's the guy's name?

31
00:02:02,975 --> 00:02:03,479
Scott: Paul Allen?

32
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:09,759
Scott: He always kept trying to make his yacht bigger and bigger and bigger and he'd buy bigger ones That way whenever he was pulling out.

33
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:15,459
Scott: He wouldn't have like some Bill Gates or someone with a bigger yacht next to him He would always be pulling out in the biggest boat.

34
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,667
Rym: But so basically I remember that time.

35
00:02:18,707 --> 00:02:27,340
Rym: the other boat it was interesting cuz our boat for the Hall and Oates tribute band was Pretty much 90% like white people all dressed the same way.

36
00:02:27,641 --> 00:02:35,060
Rym: Yeah, the other boat was no white people and everybody was dressed real fashion nice.

37
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:38,954
Rym: And the music coming out of that boat sounded like the opposite of Hall and Oates.

38
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:43,113
Rym: and it was like that boat went off into The distance and we were thinking about jumping for it.

39
00:02:43,315 --> 00:02:44,139
Scott: I would have jumped for it.

40
00:02:45,661 --> 00:02:46,946
Scott: How far how far was a jump?

41
00:02:47,407 --> 00:02:50,036
Rym: so the boat that time it's a parkour on.

42
00:02:50,478 --> 00:02:51,640
Rym: so this other time We're on this boat.

43
00:02:52,122 --> 00:03:01,479
Scott: If you land if there's a party boat and you arrive on that party boat by jumping from an adjacent party boat You're the only officially the life of the party unless you're the party frog.

44
00:03:02,621 --> 00:03:14,100
Rym: So, but I remember when we got back that other boat got back around the same time and There was this weird walk of shame down the gangplank where like every basically normal people were walking off the boat.

45
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,357
Rym: They were fine, but like every 20 or 30 people they were.

46
00:03:18,437 --> 00:03:30,684
Rym: almost invariably It was always a woman wearing like four inch heels who was too drunk to walk Trying to make their way down the gang playing to fall off that gang playing and they're like falling off of each other and it Was like such a thing.

47
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:31,407
Rym: It was kind of funny.

48
00:03:31,467 --> 00:03:33,395
Rym: But on this other boat, we were on a party boat.

49
00:03:33,455 --> 00:03:34,239
Rym: same deal hanging out.

50
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:37,860
Rym: There's fine boat time and the boat gets back and we're getting off the boat.

51
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:39,226
Rym: We get off the boat right away.

52
00:03:39,246 --> 00:03:46,829
Rym: And then as we're standing there waiting for the rest of our friends to all get off the boat the Shame walk of the drunk people was there again.

53
00:03:46,929 --> 00:03:55,940
Rym: and because we stood there while all the drunk people got off the boat I got to see in the fullness of that situation and I think that this happens every time there's a party boat.

54
00:03:56,141 --> 00:03:58,780
Rym: There's a surprising number of people who drink so much on these boats.

55
00:03:59,082 --> 00:04:01,435
Rym: They cannot get off of the boat under their own power.

56
00:04:01,455 --> 00:04:06,335
Rym: Mm-hmm I don't know what happens to those people after they do get off the boat because the boat is

57
00:04:06,355 --> 00:04:09,391
Scott: long as they don't drive home And they take a subway or a cab because the boat

58
00:04:09,432 --> 00:04:10,760
Rym: people help them get off the boat

59
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,911
Scott: They barf in the back of an uber or something, but they do

60
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:14,520
Rym: not help them after that point.

61
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,276
Rym: So I watched this one dude stagger down the gang playing like gaining momentum.

62
00:04:18,315 --> 00:04:28,710
Rym: the whole time He gets to the bottom and just kind of keeps going straight and then bumps into the wall That was like 15 feet away from the water Mm-hmm, and then just stands there and does not move.

63
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,156
Rym: and he was still standing there when we left.

64
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:30,839
Scott: Oh, he's standing.

65
00:04:30,859 --> 00:04:31,160
Scott: That's good.

66
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,384
Rym: No, I don't.

67
00:04:32,404 --> 00:04:34,813
Rym: maybe he knocked himself out, but he was just like propped up against the wall.

68
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:37,927
Rym: I couldn't quite tell that's fine There's a good boat.

69
00:04:37,947 --> 00:04:40,080
Scott: He wasn't moving into the road or something, you know, yeah.

70
00:04:41,201 --> 00:04:44,879
Scott: So I think if like a drunk guy, you know, if you see a drunk person you just ignore them.

71
00:04:45,321 --> 00:04:52,969
Scott: But if you see, you know a drunk person like stumbling about randomly and they're near a road You kind of have to call through on one.

72
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:59,620
Rym: maybe yeah a couple of times in my life I've steered someone who was drunk away because it's like you don't want to go from walking into the subway track.

73
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,180
Scott: Yeah, it's like you don't want to go near them because they might barf on you or fight you or something.

74
00:05:03,682 --> 00:05:08,418
Scott: But you also you don't want them to die just getting hit by a car because by stumbling into the road.

75
00:05:08,438 --> 00:05:16,679
Rym: Yep So the other thing that happened to me that was kind of interesting is I got this device and I asked you earlier You know, I pointed out I was gonna talk about it.

76
00:05:17,262 --> 00:05:22,720
Rym: It might look like a battery but it's actually a power adapter to charge an LG device of some kind.

77
00:05:22,902 --> 00:05:24,460
Scott: It's a it's a USB charger.

78
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:30,500
Scott: It has two prongs for power at one end at least in the United States and it has USB hole on the other end.

79
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,645
Scott: It's kind of boring.

80
00:05:31,786 --> 00:05:32,569
Scott: What's what's the big?

81
00:05:32,589 --> 00:05:35,120
Rym: So the prongs are bent quite dramatic.

82
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:35,280
Rym: The

83
00:05:35,341 --> 00:05:51,483
Scott: prongs are bent out like ears like ones pointing to the left of ones pointing to the right like somebody took pliers and made It this shape to make like a cute little like you were making like you can be a little toy out of it Put two googly eyes on it and draw a little mouth and use some pipe cleaners to make arms and legs and you have like A cute little guy.

84
00:05:51,503 --> 00:05:54,135
Rym: Yeah, so I did take pliers and do that yesterday.

85
00:05:54,155 --> 00:05:55,240
Rym: And that is why I like that.

86
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,004
Scott: Why did you do that?

87
00:05:56,265 --> 00:06:09,303
Rym: So we were watching TV and I'm laying there and I hear this noise like this heavy vibrating buzzing noise like like Like hypnotoad.

88
00:06:09,846 --> 00:06:11,212
Rym: Mmm, so but it's I like.

89
00:06:11,313 --> 00:06:14,872
Rym: I'd heard it off and on throughout the day But there's a lot of construction outside our building.

90
00:06:14,892 --> 00:06:16,140
Rym: So I kind of just chalked it up to that.

91
00:06:16,321 --> 00:06:24,700
Rym: Yeah, but then I'm sitting there and is like really bothering me Like it's louder than it should be and I saw like I touched the window and like it's not vibrating.

92
00:06:24,782 --> 00:06:25,538
Rym: I'm trying to figure it out.

93
00:06:25,821 --> 00:06:38,710
Rym: so eventually we have this power strip on the couch and there's a USB charger plugged into it and then There's this assortment of like five other one-off USB chargers that I guess people have over the years Plugged into that when they visited and just left there.

94
00:06:39,193 --> 00:06:40,860
Scott: Why don't they use the group charger?

95
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,728
Rym: I don't know like the group charger is there.

96
00:06:42,849 --> 00:06:49,639
Rym: and yet I watch people sit next to it Take their phone out plug into the power strip with a device like this.

97
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:55,627
Rym: Yeah, so whoever left this device here is losing it because I'm throwing it away I just damage it so that no one will use it.

98
00:06:55,647 --> 00:06:59,480
Rym: because I realize eventually because I turn off the power strip the buzzing stops.

99
00:07:00,144 --> 00:07:05,239
Rym: Oh, I turn the power strip back on And I one by one unplug things from it.

100
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:12,180
Rym: And when I unplug this and held it up to my ear, it was buzzing so loud that you would be surprised.

101
00:07:13,521 --> 00:07:18,657
Rym: And it's continued to buzz because you know, it's there's a coil in here it's there's induction for like 45 seconds.

102
00:07:20,821 --> 00:07:23,379
Rym: Pretty sure there's problems inside of this thing.

103
00:07:23,822 --> 00:07:28,849
Rym: So I damaged it so that no one can use it and I'm going to dispose of it Which is the topic of the show.

104
00:07:28,869 --> 00:07:30,820
Scott: you just missed our disposal opportunity.

105
00:07:30,861 --> 00:07:37,500
Rym: Yeah I disposed of a lot of things that the disposal opportunity and this is gonna go in my bucket until the next disposal opportunity.

106
00:07:37,922 --> 00:07:40,173
Rym: Hmm, I guess I could take it like staples or something like.

107
00:07:40,214 --> 00:07:41,299
Rym: those places will take this stuff.

108
00:07:41,843 --> 00:07:42,246
Scott: Best buy.

109
00:07:42,488 --> 00:07:43,959
Rym: Yeah, which anyway got any news.

110
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:45,982
Scott: What was?

111
00:07:46,103 --> 00:07:51,180
Scott: I don't have any news, but I did acquire an iPhone 7 so let's talk about that, right?

112
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:58,380
Scott: So my original plan was to get the iPhone 7s which you know, the iPhone 6s came out March.

113
00:07:58,863 --> 00:08:00,877
Scott: So if I could wait until March I get iPhone 7s.

114
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,659
Scott: It's almost Gary almost guaranteed not a hundred percent guaranteed which would be a smaller iPhone, which is nice.

115
00:08:07,724 --> 00:08:13,479
Rym: It's basically the iPhone 5 Small phones because this phone I realized in my my PAX Prime hoodie.

116
00:08:13,801 --> 00:08:17,634
Rym: There's this little sub pocket within the right main pocket and I there's no like.

117
00:08:17,755 --> 00:08:19,140
Rym: there's nothing that would go in that pocket.

118
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,231
Rym: Yeah, this phone fits in that pocket pocket perfectly.

119
00:08:22,532 --> 00:08:22,813
Rym: Mm-hmm.

120
00:08:23,154 --> 00:08:24,900
Rym: My own phone could not go in that pocket.

121
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:25,960
Scott: So here's the situation though.

122
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,399
Scott: So I go to the Apple store and I'm looking at the iPhone 6s and I'm like, huh?

123
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:33,674
Scott: You know the iPhone 7s is basically gonna be that only better right?

124
00:08:33,754 --> 00:08:35,440
Scott: Is that is that gonna cut it, right?

125
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:40,216
Scott: Am I gonna be able to use my iPhone 6 for a few more months and then get this guy?

126
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:41,299
Scott: Will that be okay?

127
00:08:41,318 --> 00:09:00,540
Scott: and I started to do some researches and while it is great that it's smaller it actually wasn't as much smaller as I remember like I put it next to the iPhone 6 and 7 and it was only like Less than an inch smaller in one dimension and like not even a centimeter smaller in the other dimension and it's actually thicker.

128
00:09:01,122 --> 00:09:05,559
Scott: So, I don't know about the total volume difference but you know, it wasn't that big a deal.

129
00:09:05,619 --> 00:09:22,434
Scott: also You know, I mostly care like the size is like my number one thing I cared about But it's like they're all the second tier priorities Using that iPhone 6s after using an iPhone regular 6 for two years.

130
00:09:23,216 --> 00:09:24,300
Scott: It was like way slow.

131
00:09:24,824 --> 00:09:31,198
Rym: You know that is a trade-off because my you know I have the Xperia z5 compact which I still think is the best Android hardware in the world.

132
00:09:31,258 --> 00:09:31,700
Rym: bar none.

133
00:09:32,162 --> 00:09:33,974
Scott: But Google pixels come in any second.

134
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:34,940
Rym: Yeah, and we'll see how that goes.

135
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:39,620
Scott: But I don't know if Google pixels gonna be a great phone, but I think it's gonna be a normal phone.

136
00:09:39,861 --> 00:09:44,020
Scott: But I think the advantage is you're gonna get your normal Android with your updates constantly.

137
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,500
Scott: Yeah, what's gonna put that ahead of every other Android phone?

138
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:52,100
Rym: But the only problem with this phone is that the battery lasts two full days like for real.

139
00:09:52,581 --> 00:09:55,892
Rym: But it only does that because it's kind of slow and a little laggy.

140
00:09:56,294 --> 00:10:00,451
Rym: if I turn off all the power saving shit It lasts about as long as a normal iPhone like.

141
00:10:00,471 --> 00:10:01,415
Rym: it lasts about one day.

142
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:05,732
Scott: and it's way fast And like even though the screen on the iPhone 6s is a retina screen.

143
00:10:05,752 --> 00:10:08,060
Scott: or I mean se not success se.

144
00:10:08,381 --> 00:10:10,007
Scott: Yeah, I've been saying success the whole time.

145
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,332
Scott: I mean se the small one.

146
00:10:11,633 --> 00:10:14,003
Scott: Yeah success is the one that's in between the six And the seven.

147
00:10:14,043 --> 00:10:17,220
Rym: well, I've got a z5 C for what it's worth, right?

148
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:25,056
Scott: but yeah, the SE is the small iPhone and Like everything else about the small iPhone except for the fact that it was small was like worse.

149
00:10:25,116 --> 00:10:26,280
Scott: the camera was worse.

150
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,949
Rym: Yeah, even here does the z5 compacts camera.

151
00:10:28,989 --> 00:10:30,394
Rym: while it's a really good camera.

152
00:10:30,434 --> 00:10:33,127
Rym: Like it's as good as an older screen The screen was worse.

153
00:10:33,168 --> 00:10:33,349
Scott: Yep.

154
00:10:33,409 --> 00:10:34,335
Rym: The screen is only 720p on this thing.

155
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:40,671
Rym: Yeah, so I was like, uh, like the big version of this phone is better in every way except It's too big to put in my pocket right.

156
00:10:40,752 --> 00:10:47,620
Scott: further compounding My difficulties is that my iPhone 6 while working perfectly and in great condition was having battery issues.

157
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,060
Rym: I think you sabotaged that battery on purpose.

158
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,016
Scott: It was not having battery issues of the sort where the battery was dying.

159
00:10:54,157 --> 00:10:57,147
Scott: quite the opposite The battery was lasting just as long as it ever had.

160
00:10:57,609 --> 00:11:04,900
Scott: but the battery meter that reported how much percentage is left Was all fucked up despite me trying to recalibrate it multiple times.

161
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,756
Scott: So for example, I would I had it at a hundred percent.

162
00:11:08,797 --> 00:11:11,854
Scott: I left the office Like less than an hour later.

163
00:11:11,935 --> 00:11:23,760
Scott: It said like 70% and then like less than an hour by the time I got back to the office It was like 20-something percent that I did use it to make a video but 20% after making like a little Scott's lunch video.

164
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:25,019
Scott: That's not too much.

165
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:31,980
Scott: Yeah As soon as I plugged it back into my computer at the office like plug it in do I acknowledge that I've been plugged in?

166
00:11:32,482 --> 00:11:33,386
Scott: The battery meter said 88%.

167
00:11:33,386 --> 00:11:37,825
Scott: I had only actually used 12% of the battery It was.

168
00:11:37,866 --> 00:11:40,418
Scott: I tried to drain it completely once to recalibrate it.

169
00:11:41,121 --> 00:11:42,446
Scott: I was went to bed and it said 1%.

170
00:11:42,446 --> 00:11:46,061
Scott: I woke up and it said 1%.

171
00:11:46,061 --> 00:11:53,755
Scott: It was lunchtime and it still said 1% even though it hadn't been plugged in since the previous evening and Then just about at lunchtime.

172
00:11:53,815 --> 00:11:57,870
Scott: It turned off So it had battery meter issues.

173
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:05,198
Scott: So I'm like, oh rather than deal with these issues Because I mean you might think well if it's lasting as long and the meter just as 1% you just ignore.

174
00:12:05,218 --> 00:12:10,460
Rym: the probe is the Consequences of the battery hitting zero when you're out and about can be devastating.

175
00:12:10,701 --> 00:12:20,616
Scott: The real consequence is that when the iPhone meter hits 20% it goes in the low power mode and stops doing stuff And then it tries to turn itself off even though it had plenty of power left.

176
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:21,680
Scott: because the meter is wrong.

177
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,780
Scott: It's doing things based on the meter that are you know getting annoying?

178
00:12:25,641 --> 00:12:31,502
Rym: Yeah, my phone will do that when I hit 10% but I can configure that also to replace the battery would have cost 60 to $80.

179
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:33,247
Scott: so I'm like, well fuck it.

180
00:12:33,267 --> 00:12:34,511
Scott: Let me just get iPhone 7.

181
00:12:34,511 --> 00:12:36,677
Scott: So the reason I also got the iPhone 7?

182
00:12:36,677 --> 00:12:39,432
Scott: because it was effectively free ish.

183
00:12:41,482 --> 00:12:46,746
Scott: So the reason it was effectively free ish is because Verizon changed their plans.

184
00:12:46,847 --> 00:12:55,495
Scott: I looked at like maybe switch to t-mobile maybe You know whatever but horizon changed their plan to where I was paying for six gigs of data like $100 a month, right?

185
00:12:55,535 --> 00:13:01,159
Scott: I Could change the plan to either eight gigs of data for the same amount of money.

186
00:13:02,402 --> 00:13:07,800
Scott: But they now allow rollover data and I looked at my past history and I was using less than four gigs a month.

187
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:13,454
Scott: So I went to the four gig a month plan Which is 70 bucks a month like 30 gigs for $30 for four gigs.

188
00:13:15,181 --> 00:13:15,992
Scott: fuck that right.

189
00:13:16,539 --> 00:13:23,666
Scott: and The rollover data should help me in those months that like one month a year where there's two conventions and I go over the limit The rollover data will get me through.

190
00:13:24,128 --> 00:13:29,005
Scott: so I saved 30 bucks a month by switching to the Verizon plan That was smaller.

191
00:13:29,025 --> 00:13:37,960
Scott: and then I got the iPhone upgrade plan Which is get a new iPhone every single year no matter what and all you do is pay 30 something bucks a month.

192
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,760
Scott: So I'm basically paying a hundred bucks a month that I was paying all this time.

193
00:13:41,422 --> 00:13:43,409
Scott: And I just get a new iPhone every year no matter what.

194
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:49,220
Scott: but the other problem with the small iPhone the SE They don't let you do the upgrade plan with that phone.

195
00:13:49,521 --> 00:13:52,216
Scott: They only let you do it with the big iPhone or the normal iPhone.

196
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,883
Scott: really Yeah, you can't get.

197
00:13:54,144 --> 00:13:57,573
Scott: you can't use the iPhone upgrade plan, which gives you permanent Apple care.

198
00:13:57,634 --> 00:14:01,394
Scott: also with the small iPhone You can only do it with the normal iPhone.

199
00:14:01,535 --> 00:14:02,080
Rym: That's a shame.

200
00:14:02,282 --> 00:14:03,451
Scott: So I got.

201
00:14:03,652 --> 00:14:04,620
Scott: I just said all right fuck it.

202
00:14:04,861 --> 00:14:08,614
Scott: I went into the Apple store and they gave me an iPhone 7 for effectively nothing.

203
00:14:08,635 --> 00:14:11,791
Rym: and I know okay We'll see what I do cuz I got my phone.

204
00:14:11,932 --> 00:14:13,200
Rym: so this phone will last me a while.

205
00:14:13,361 --> 00:14:16,558
Scott: So I just see what's great about the iPhone 7 and you know what?

206
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:21,956
Scott: Compared to the iPhone 6 the I I mean I've gotten every iPhone.

207
00:14:21,976 --> 00:14:23,000
Scott: that was a major jump.

208
00:14:23,241 --> 00:14:24,445
Scott: I got the iPhone 3G.

209
00:14:24,867 --> 00:14:30,286
Scott: I got the iPhone 4 5 & 6 and now this is the 7 and The like.

210
00:14:30,466 --> 00:14:35,528
Scott: the 3G was way different than the original one The 4 was way different than 3G.

211
00:14:35,669 --> 00:14:42,421
Scott: the 5 was way different than the 4. the 6 was way Different than the 5. the 7 is not that much different than the 6.

212
00:14:42,421 --> 00:14:43,664
Scott: It's like it's it might.

213
00:14:43,725 --> 00:14:49,179
Scott: it's basically like 6s and 6 6s and 7. all might as well be really the same phone.

214
00:14:50,722 --> 00:14:53,273
Scott: The mate like the camera is significantly improved.

215
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:58,240
Scott: There's no question about that Which is nice, but it's not like game-changing.

216
00:14:58,862 --> 00:15:05,729
Scott: It has the force touch thing where you can push down harder on something to get a context menu Which actually works really well, which is nice.

217
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:06,131
Rym: Yep.

218
00:15:06,432 --> 00:15:08,198
Scott: The home button is not a physical button.

219
00:15:08,358 --> 00:15:10,040
Rym: tap ticks That's the word for that.

220
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:16,573
Scott: It has all these tap ticks like the steam controller has and it really feels like you're pushing a home button But it's not a physical mechanism.

221
00:15:16,613 --> 00:15:17,359
Scott: So it's way better.

222
00:15:17,379 --> 00:15:17,439
Rym: now.

223
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,740
Rym: I saw the usual pre-complaining of people who were like, oh they're rid of the physical.

224
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:24,019
Rym: You know the people who complain about those kinds of things complain about a thing before they use it.

225
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:28,617
Rym: But in this case, I noticed when the iPhone felt weird for about two minutes and now it's.

226
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:29,038
Scott: I can't go.

227
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:30,678
Scott: It would feel weird if I went back.

228
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:40,015
Rym: Yeah, when the phone came you literally walk over to me and you're like touch this and I touch the button and it felt pretty Good, but yeah, all those complaints the pre-complaints pretty much disappeared when people actually touched it.

229
00:15:40,135 --> 00:15:40,958
Scott: So it's fine.

230
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:42,948
Scott: It's a button That's not a real buttons.

231
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,095
Scott: Yeah, it works.

232
00:15:44,216 --> 00:15:44,859
Rym: button is coming out.

233
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:52,079
Scott: The only valid complaint that I can find right is in regards of course to the no headphone hole.

234
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:56,149
Scott: now People be like, there's no headphone hole DRM.

235
00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:02,282
Scott: and I'm like dudes that while I am anti DRM Just as much as you that is the biggest bullshit I ever heard.

236
00:16:02,342 --> 00:16:08,400
Scott: because they're worried that for example that there's only this lightning output that someone could write code.

237
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:14,080
Scott: That's like if watching football game on phone don't allow audio out lightning hole.

238
00:16:14,822 --> 00:16:19,235
Scott: You could write code on an old iPhone that says don't allow audio out analog hole.

239
00:16:19,275 --> 00:16:28,649
Scott: Yeah, it's not any fucking different Because the audio still originates at a digital source and therefore can be controlled by the same DRM regardless of whether there's an analog Output or not.

240
00:16:28,872 --> 00:16:35,286
Scott: Yeah, and Because they give you that lightning to analog hole They can't stop you.

241
00:16:35,306 --> 00:16:37,816
Scott: It's like what the you know, right?

242
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:39,663
Scott: It's it's Different.

243
00:16:39,864 --> 00:16:46,113
Scott: now people I think they analogize because inside an iPhone 6, you know, what's behind that analog hole Effectively a lightning hole.

244
00:16:46,295 --> 00:16:48,305
Rym: Yeah lose a red Any fucking different.

245
00:16:48,607 --> 00:17:02,628
Rym: but so with I think people get confused because with a video like the HTTP nonsense Yeah the deal is if you don't have a trusted chain the analog output meaning the light your human eyes can see is Downgraded in quality.

246
00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:03,071
Scott: That's true.

247
00:17:03,674 --> 00:17:07,893
Rym: and with audio What down great like they're not gonna do the same thing.

248
00:17:08,032 --> 00:17:09,680
Rym: audio is not downgraded.

249
00:17:09,761 --> 00:17:11,359
Rym: It would be one thing isn't copyright?

250
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,243
Scott: It'll be one thing.

251
00:17:12,345 --> 00:17:12,726
Scott: if it was.

252
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:15,700
Scott: you must use Bluetooth headphones or lightning.

253
00:17:16,521 --> 00:17:18,868
Scott: You cannot use analog headphones.

254
00:17:18,888 --> 00:17:21,617
Scott: we did not make an adapter but no there's an adapter.

255
00:17:21,659 --> 00:17:23,911
Scott: therefore That's a bullshit argument.

256
00:17:24,092 --> 00:17:30,214
Rym: Also audio is Basically trivial to capture like say there was HTTP style.

257
00:17:30,254 --> 00:17:31,618
Rym: crazy DRM down the road.

258
00:17:31,638 --> 00:17:36,151
Rym: in these things Speakers are microphones like the at closing.

259
00:17:36,231 --> 00:17:40,891
Rym: bringing the analog hole back into the digital realm also Has no DRM money.

260
00:17:40,911 --> 00:17:41,939
Scott: you could always do it that way.

261
00:17:43,623 --> 00:17:44,657
Rym: Quality depending on.

262
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:48,107
Scott: Regardless, there is a valid argument though.

263
00:17:48,147 --> 00:17:50,534
Scott: The valid argument is many people pointed this out.

264
00:17:51,055 --> 00:17:51,877
Scott: There's no headphone hole.

265
00:17:51,897 --> 00:17:52,820
Scott: There's only a lightning hole.

266
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:56,740
Scott: You can't charge and listen at the same time through the lightning hole.

267
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:06,720
Scott: You would need Bluetooth or wireless headphones to listen and charge it or a special lightning Special thingy that has an analog hole and a lightning hole so you could charge and listen at the same time.

268
00:18:07,323 --> 00:18:13,991
Scott: But I bought an extra analog hole nine bucks just in case plus I might you know.

269
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:17,392
Scott: and Yeah, it's not the biggest deal.

270
00:18:17,594 --> 00:18:18,440
Scott: It's slightly annoying.

271
00:18:18,782 --> 00:18:30,854
Rym: I mean the only the only time I could ever see that actually being annoying is That I often fuck around with my phone when I'm flying Yep, and I'm usually also plugged into the USB port on the plane.

272
00:18:31,155 --> 00:18:32,940
Rym: keeping my phone charged while I'm flying.

273
00:18:33,462 --> 00:18:34,265
Rym: I could not do both.

274
00:18:34,285 --> 00:18:34,867
Rym: Mm-hmm.

275
00:18:35,249 --> 00:18:36,976
Rym: That's still a minor annoyance at best.

276
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,751
Rym: Mm-hmm Still I honestly though.

277
00:18:39,872 --> 00:18:43,377
Rym: I don't think Switching bought them that much.

278
00:18:45,301 --> 00:18:45,382
Scott: It.

279
00:18:45,563 --> 00:18:49,762
Scott: I think they put the tactic thing where the headphone hole used to be yeah, they could have gotten around that I mean they made.

280
00:18:49,843 --> 00:18:50,626
Rym: it's been all they.

281
00:18:50,646 --> 00:18:58,080
Rym: all they get out of this really is they make it thinner and I guess they Don't have to have a RAM deck in the phone anymore for audio, but they still do because there's two speakers.

282
00:18:58,627 --> 00:18:59,500
Scott: Yeah, oh, that's another thing.

283
00:18:59,802 --> 00:19:03,664
Scott: Stereo sound because they put a speaker where the headphone hole used to be Yep, and we used to be.

284
00:19:03,724 --> 00:19:05,993
Scott: only the iPad had stereo sound but now the iPhone.

285
00:19:06,013 --> 00:19:09,970
Rym: but any argument that they don't need RAM decks Or anything is bullshit because they still have speakers.

286
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:12,280
Rym: So there's still something doing that in the iPhone.

287
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,047
Rym: Yeah, I guess you don't need two of them now.

288
00:19:14,831 --> 00:19:15,694
Scott: I don't know three of them.

289
00:19:15,815 --> 00:19:17,120
Rym: I don't know how the iPhone looks internally.

290
00:19:18,221 --> 00:19:19,084
Scott: You can look it up online.

291
00:19:19,104 --> 00:19:19,847
Scott: It's not that excited.

292
00:19:19,887 --> 00:19:23,540
Scott: But yeah iPhone 7 really similar to previous iPhones.

293
00:19:23,701 --> 00:19:26,400
Scott: But you know, it's fine cuz I'm gonna get an iPhone.

294
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:33,540
Scott: See there's a rumor that next year there won't be an iPhone 7s They'll be an iPhone 8 and they just because they're sucking they're going slower.

295
00:19:34,163 --> 00:19:35,853
Scott: Which is great because I got the upgrade plan.

296
00:19:35,873 --> 00:19:38,764
Scott: So I'll just get it for nothing I'll just get one.

297
00:19:39,266 --> 00:19:39,848
Scott: So it's all good.

298
00:19:40,631 --> 00:19:42,920
Rym: So in other news that was kind of interesting.

299
00:19:44,920 --> 00:20:08,309
Rym: Recently amber alerts and like the all those sorts of things got a lot of press in New York City because there were two separate instances where one an amber alert went out on the Tell everyone in an area with phones Overriding any settings they might have emergency broadcast system and it broadcast an amber alert to basically everyone in New York Which you know 20 ish

300
00:20:08,389 --> 00:20:09,132
Scott: imagine.

301
00:20:09,393 --> 00:20:14,349
Scott: Yeah millions of phones all going Simultaneously, it's just a best.

302
00:20:14,389 --> 00:20:17,805
Rym: you the best part about that I mean, I'm good.

303
00:20:17,825 --> 00:20:21,477
Rym: on one hand just the concept of amber alerts seems like a good thing.

304
00:20:21,517 --> 00:20:26,639
Rym: But on the other hand The odds of me acting on one of those are basically zero.

305
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:31,820
Scott: I Would love to see the stats on whether an amber alert is actually saved a child or something.

306
00:20:32,101 --> 00:20:39,778
Scott: Yeah, and aren't there like, you know while I you know Agree that a child that has been kidnapped is bad news and we should do something about that.

307
00:20:41,047 --> 00:20:51,700
Scott: If you're going to alert everybody Literally everybody I think it needs to be even more serious than that Like it needs to be as serious as like holy shit.

308
00:20:52,202 --> 00:20:56,300
Scott: You know a meteor is going to land or holy shits everyone seek shelter.

309
00:20:56,521 --> 00:21:05,300
Rym: Like I was okay with the second time they used it around here when the guy who was trying to do all the bombings They put an alert out saying here's this guy's photo.

310
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,047
Rym: He's armed and dangerous and somewhere in the city.

311
00:21:07,288 --> 00:21:09,235
Scott: Even that is a borderline usage.

312
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:10,420
Rym: I think that was fine.

313
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:22,220
Rym: Now if I only think that was fine because they were pretty sure he was in the city They had a photo of him They knew who he was and he was likely dangerous and he was armed and you know that I think that was no K use.

314
00:21:22,601 --> 00:21:27,900
Scott: I think you only should alert literally everybody of something if literally everybody has to take action.

315
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:31,340
Rym: But that one was easy because everyone basically has looked around like was the guy here?

316
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:35,638
Rym: It's not like unsolved mysteries where you're an amber alert where the odds are pretty much zero.

317
00:21:35,658 --> 00:21:39,775
Rym: this works Mmm, but the out the the fallout of this was not.

318
00:21:40,116 --> 00:21:41,080
Rym: why did everyone bother me?

319
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:49,215
Rym: Most people are okay with that alert though with the amber alert Twitter was nothing but to see if people going what the fuck is an amber alert.

320
00:21:49,376 --> 00:21:50,299
Scott: Well, people don't know.

321
00:21:50,782 --> 00:21:51,828
Rym: No, it's a problem.

322
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,357
Scott: That is a problem.

323
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:57,132
Scott: Yeah Silver alert is just as serious.

324
00:21:57,192 --> 00:21:58,660
Scott: I think as amber alert, right?

325
00:21:58,881 --> 00:22:00,600
Rym: It's like there's an old person you missing.

326
00:22:00,921 --> 00:22:04,980
Rym: So this is you want to make a real cold horrible calculated evil.

327
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:09,449
Scott: People's lives are more valuable than old people's lives because you could die Anyway in a vacuum between the two.

328
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:11,460
Rym: a young person's life is worth more, right?

329
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,303
Scott: But is it worth?

330
00:22:12,785 --> 00:22:15,517
Scott: is it the difference between an old person's life and young person's life?

331
00:22:15,557 --> 00:22:16,240
Scott: the difference between?

332
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:22,000
Scott: Bothering every single person's phone and not I think the line should be is the gap.

333
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:29,640
Rym: What are the odds that everyone getting this alert will alter the otherwise predicted outcome of this situation?

334
00:22:32,965 --> 00:22:43,447
Scott: Everyone to vote Today vote now, we'll keep alerting your phone until you vote Your phone number.

335
00:22:43,467 --> 00:22:48,234
Rym: in fact until your phone shows up at the polls We're gonna keep alerting you and then your phone is gonna disable itself.

336
00:22:48,455 --> 00:22:57,100
Rym: Yeah You want to alter history with alerts on phones, but the fallout from the terror alert was why is this system?

337
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,753
Rym: So primitive and can't eat.

338
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:01,223
Rym: It can send 300.

339
00:23:01,223 --> 00:23:03,049
Rym: I think it can only send 90 characters.

340
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:05,880
Scott: Yeah, it's a pretty shitty system in a world.

341
00:23:06,141 --> 00:23:23,655
Scott: If you look if you already agree that you're gonna use this system Whether we're gonna argue about whether it should or should not be used in which cases it should still be a much better system That is capable of say, you know saying messages out loud for people who are blind or showing pictures of the guy You're looking for or the person you're looking.

342
00:23:23,716 --> 00:23:29,280
Scott: Okay, Scott So a car having links that you can click on in the message that would bring you to more.

343
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,706
Rym: So that was the thing.

344
00:23:30,746 --> 00:23:38,820
Scott: because the terror alert the reason it worked was that or doing better Targeting of exactly which phones it's going to alert and not just everyone in the whole fucking city.

345
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:47,490
Rym: So all of those 90 characters in the terror one They they used it to link to a website that had a picture of the guy and that's the only reason they caught it Mm-hmm.

346
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:53,908
Rym: So a consequence of the fact that we're kind of live streaming GeekNights when we make it now A listener just did the research for us.

347
00:23:54,290 --> 00:24:05,375
Rym: according to the amber alert government side There are 261 amber alerts total in the US between January 1st 2006. there were 10 years ago amber alerts.

348
00:24:05,495 --> 00:24:13,420
Rym: Okay in that year 214 children were recovered and 53 of those were directly attributed to the amber alerts being issued.

349
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:20,305
Scott: If it saved 53 kids a year well That's it.

350
00:24:20,346 --> 00:24:23,237
Scott: You had to quantify how annoying the alert is.

351
00:24:23,257 --> 00:24:23,739
Scott: the car.

352
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:32,333
Rym: So, you know if it was one kid a year and I don't want to get woken up if it's so effective Should we not be alerting all sorts of fucking other things?

353
00:24:32,735 --> 00:24:36,130
Rym: well maybe but that's again I think the line of whether or not you like

354
00:24:36,191 --> 00:24:42,941
Scott: if you're gonna say the amber alert is effective Then how come we're not using this alert system to say do all sorts of other good But

355
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:46,251
Rym: like what the line is will this alert one?

356
00:24:46,291 --> 00:24:49,140
Scott: We're either alerting unnecessarily or not alerting enough.

357
00:24:49,201 --> 00:24:49,856
Scott: It's one of the two.

358
00:24:50,251 --> 00:24:57,736
Rym: Yeah but I think the line has to be Will the expected outcome change or be likely to change as a result of this and at what point?

359
00:24:58,057 --> 00:24:59,100
Scott: if we alert too much?

360
00:24:59,341 --> 00:25:02,959
Scott: Will the alerts become less effective because everyone ignores them because you do too much?

361
00:25:03,562 --> 00:25:08,978
Rym: Right, and it's very telling that this is only happened as far as I can tell with this system in New York.

362
00:25:09,239 --> 00:25:10,303
Rym: twice Cuz.

363
00:25:10,323 --> 00:25:12,052
Rym: that's the only two times has ever happened to me.

364
00:25:12,293 --> 00:25:13,539
Scott: I've heard it happened to me a bunch.

365
00:25:13,981 --> 00:25:19,727
Rym: I guess I haven't once because I don't want me to have it and I got it once for flash flooding But it was specific to LIC.

366
00:25:19,847 --> 00:25:25,893
Scott: it happened twice recently and then there was a huge gap But like maybe two years ago going backwards.

367
00:25:25,994 --> 00:25:27,420
Scott: There was like a ton of it happening.

368
00:25:28,283 --> 00:25:32,506
Scott: the only time it was ever useful to me was the Yeah, the hurricanes coming.

369
00:25:32,567 --> 00:25:33,992
Scott: We're not gonna run the subway anymore.

370
00:25:34,013 --> 00:25:35,860
Scott: You better actually go home from this burning con.

371
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,026
Rym: I think that was a good one.

372
00:25:37,106 --> 00:25:41,680
Rym: Even though I literally caught the last subway out of town I think I was on the second last train.

373
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:54,020
Rym: I know I was on the last because every station the guy ran out of the train Gathered people from like the ticket booths and turned off all the lights and locked a bunch of gates Got back on the train on the train rent.

374
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:57,460
Rym: So the train ride took forever because it stopped at every station for like five minutes.

375
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,730
Scott: Yeah, mine train did not do that.

376
00:25:59,153 --> 00:26:00,020
Scott: It was the second last year.

377
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:03,820
Rym: I was real glad I caught that train cuz I realized if I didn't you're walking home in a heart.

378
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:13,324
Rym: I was gonna walk home in a hurricane over the bridge or I was a travel ban a taxi wasn't gonna take you no, or I was gonna stay in that bar and The people run in.

379
00:26:13,344 --> 00:26:19,066
Rym: the bar stayed after the subway went down and I know for a fact at least one of the bartenders did Not live in Manhattan.

380
00:26:19,447 --> 00:26:19,528
Rym: Mmm.

381
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:20,713
Rym: I don't know what that guy did.

382
00:26:20,733 --> 00:26:21,215
Rym: I don't know.

383
00:26:21,355 --> 00:26:22,360
Rym: I'll bet they just stayed at the bar.

384
00:26:22,641 --> 00:26:23,625
Rym: Maybe I would have.

385
00:26:23,866 --> 00:26:24,247
Rym: yeah, why not?

386
00:26:24,408 --> 00:26:26,798
Rym: if they let me we could just kept burning kind of going all night.

387
00:26:26,818 --> 00:26:29,778
Scott: Okay Yeah, I mean it's a hurricane shit like that happened.

388
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:37,912
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

389
00:26:38,193 --> 00:26:39,960
Rym: so, you know a toilet works, right?

390
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:45,859
Rym: Actually, I learned a whole lot about how a toilet works recently How to get rid of that silt in you in the top of your thing.

391
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:52,877
Scott: I did a whole bunch of research and I made my toilet way awesome by doing if I adjusted the water I learned everything about basic toiletry.

392
00:26:52,897 --> 00:27:02,205
Rym: now I don't know how to fix a fancy Japanese toilet but I know everything about a standard American toilets because one time we had a toilet like Emily did something and messed up a Toilet and I remember like.

393
00:27:02,747 --> 00:27:06,920
Rym: I went through all my troubleshooting steps and I determined that it was unfixable by my time.

394
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,204
Scott: I am now.

395
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:14,680
Scott: thanks to YouTube I am now an expert on basic American toilet mechanisms and can repair them and know which parts to buy an Amazon and everything.

396
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:22,975
Rym: So as a complete aside, I am terrified by the people whose houses I visited Where their toilet kind of runs and got a jiggle the handle.

397
00:27:22,995 --> 00:27:23,900
Scott: I know how to fix that.

398
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,971
Scott: Yeah, so you need to hire a plumber.

399
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:32,760
Scott: if I come to your house and you have a shitty toilet Just give me permission to make your toilet awesome and we will do that and I'll teach you how a toilet works.

400
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,847
Scott: It'll take like 10 minutes.

401
00:27:33,907 --> 00:27:34,672
Scott: It's real simple.

402
00:27:34,994 --> 00:27:38,974
Rym: Romans figured it out Not naming names, but I'm terrified by the fact that I know people.

403
00:27:39,034 --> 00:27:45,680
Rym: we've visited their house and Later like a year later we visit again and the toilet still has the same problem.

404
00:27:46,202 --> 00:27:50,200
Scott: I mean my toilet had a problem for a while until I sort of realized I can do this.

405
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,651
Scott: It's like it doesn't dawn on you because it's a black box, right?

406
00:27:52,691 --> 00:27:54,500
Scott: It's like it's like your whole life.

407
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:57,440
Rym: Well, if it's black in there, you got real serious problems, right?

408
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,019
Scott: But like your whole life you've called plumbers to fix this thing.

409
00:28:00,402 --> 00:28:03,160
Scott: You'd never imagine it like it's a really simple thing.

410
00:28:03,361 --> 00:28:11,600
Scott: And as long as the toilet itself isn't like smashed or there's something wrong with the pipes or serious problem Well, you can do it yourself so easily.

411
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:19,836
Rym: It's like babies first unlike other plumbing problems Like I generally don't take you like those use out of tote Like I'm not gonna deal with the pipes just because there's a lot of like.

412
00:28:19,876 --> 00:28:21,398
Rym: if you mess that up There's a lot of consequences.

413
00:28:21,641 --> 00:28:28,043
Scott: Well, I mean the only reason I don't do anything like with pipes is because I'm not strong enough to tighten it and then it'll Leak everywhere.

414
00:28:28,063 --> 00:28:30,397
Rym: Well, also you don't have all the specialized tools like they're like those.

415
00:28:30,477 --> 00:28:38,120
Scott: it's a lot like I could install a faucet, but I'd probably when I first turned on the faucet spray water everywhere and then be like fuck.

416
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:42,600
Rym: Well, it's just like with cars and bicycles and even skis like the main like a maintenance on a bike.

417
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:46,300
Rym: Like you can learn all the maintenance even on a fancy bike.

418
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:49,800
Scott: I mean you can learn all the maintenance on an f1 car to if someone will teach it to you.

419
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:55,360
Rym: But like bicycles are not that hard, but even I don't do most of that work because I don't own all the specialized tools.

420
00:28:55,763 --> 00:29:02,048
Scott: yeah, like I actually have a Like if you don't have quite a few of the tools But I don't have like the rack.

421
00:29:02,088 --> 00:29:05,060
Rym: to like mount my bike to like read like rejigger my brakes.

422
00:29:05,221 --> 00:29:11,580
Rym: There are ways to yeah But it's way more pain in the ass Like when I was a kid I had the rack.

423
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:17,100
Rym: I would like mount my bike and work on it and one time I tried to recalibrate all my gears without that rack.

424
00:29:17,362 --> 00:29:18,086
Rym: Fuck that noise.

425
00:29:18,126 --> 00:29:19,717
Rym: I'm gonna pay someone 60 bucks to do it.

426
00:29:19,898 --> 00:29:27,460
Rym: Yep But so do you know about the mechanics of how toilets work in terms of how and why it flushes and why it doesn't smell?

427
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:35,720
Rym: Yes, so, uh Why would like say you put a brick of gold like a small brick of gold in the bottom of your toilet?

428
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,219
Rym: Would it flush or would it just sit there?

429
00:29:39,382 --> 00:29:41,449
Scott: Is it physically small enough to go through.

430
00:29:41,469 --> 00:29:43,576
Rym: it's physically small enough, but it's real dense and heavy.

431
00:29:43,596 --> 00:29:48,519
Rym: I Mean it's like we're talking ten times heavier denser than your poop.

432
00:29:49,381 --> 00:29:56,106
Scott: I'm not sure how strong the toilet flush is but I have a feeling it's it gets pretty strong and it also depends on how Much water you got in the tank.

433
00:29:56,166 --> 00:30:04,176
Scott: Yeah, if you got a big even a little bowl and you flush it It's not gonna be enough right and it depends on the shape of the gold bar also, right?

434
00:30:04,196 --> 00:30:12,176
Scott: Yeah, so but There are circumstances in which that yes, you could flush some amount of gold.

435
00:30:12,196 --> 00:30:15,248
Rym: That would be surprising Yeah, but it turns out pretty much.

436
00:30:15,288 --> 00:30:17,640
Rym: No anything heavy and dense is just not gonna flush.

437
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,965
Rym: It'll stay in the bottom of the bowl forever.

438
00:30:19,226 --> 00:30:22,540
Rym: Okay, so let's say you proved instead of poop poop.

439
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,551
Rym: You pooped liquid mercury, but in the same volume as your poop.

440
00:30:25,932 --> 00:30:28,020
Rym: and then you tried to flush the total go near mercury.

441
00:30:28,361 --> 00:30:33,100
Rym: But let's say well elemental mercury in your body actually is not that bad for you because it just passes right.

442
00:30:33,226 --> 00:30:37,232
Scott: Okay, wait So we're talking about mercury in a nator to in water.

443
00:30:37,373 --> 00:30:43,039
Rym: you poop mercury in the quantity You normally poop into a normal water toilet and then flush it.

444
00:30:43,401 --> 00:30:46,533
Rym: Will it go out into the sewer system or will it stay in the bottom?

445
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:55,415
Rym: I Did not know the answer and then I watched this video and I know he's pretty heavy, but it's also a liquid But it doesn't mix with water.

446
00:30:56,482 --> 00:30:58,209
Scott: So it's like this it's a really tough call.

447
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:08,620
Rym: what if you filled a toilet the top Entirely with mercury and then flushed mercury and then pooped gold and then flushed it with the gold that the water didn't move?

448
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:11,223
Rym: now Get moved by the mercury with it Like what would happen?

449
00:31:11,243 --> 00:31:15,340
Scott: the mercury would definitely flush and it would be a way stronger flush than with water.

450
00:31:15,825 --> 00:31:17,360
Scott: Would it be enough to move gold?

451
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:17,941
Scott: What's the?

452
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:22,600
Scott: I don't forget the atomic number of gold and mercury if you're intrigued by the answers to all these questions?

453
00:31:22,963 --> 00:31:29,374
Scott: My video is titled flushing 240 pounds of mercury if the atomic number of mercury is water.

454
00:31:29,615 --> 00:31:33,469
Scott: if the atomic number of mercury is Bigger than the number for gold.

455
00:31:33,771 --> 00:31:35,379
Scott: I think it would flush the gold.

456
00:31:35,741 --> 00:31:39,160
Rym: It flushes the gold but he fills an entire toilet with mercury.

457
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,470
Scott: But is mercury have more protons than gold does?

458
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:43,874
Rym: Uh, watch your show.

459
00:31:43,975 --> 00:31:45,720
Scott: Let me look at my periodic table.

460
00:31:46,041 --> 00:31:51,405
Rym: oh, he also flushes a lead bullet and it floats on the mercury and This video is just great.

461
00:31:51,647 --> 00:31:52,450
Scott: I'm looking at a period.

462
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:54,560
Rym: also, you know the chain that pulls they'll stop her up.

463
00:31:54,761 --> 00:31:57,036
Rym: Yeah, it breaks cuz the mercury is too heavy.

464
00:31:57,056 --> 00:32:00,710
Rym: Oh, yeah There's a moment where he sticks his hand in the mercury.

465
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:05,660
Rym: Let's see lead is Now why she's about to stick his hand in the mercury.

466
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:08,472
Rym: Where is it?

467
00:32:08,893 --> 00:32:10,318
Scott: Don't put your hand in mercury crazy.

468
00:32:10,339 --> 00:32:12,426
Rym: Yeah, but there's him flushing the toilet.

469
00:32:12,446 --> 00:32:16,178
Rym: This video is pretty good All right, so you got a thing of the day.

470
00:32:16,198 --> 00:32:18,149
Rym: I know you're looking up your atomic numbers.

471
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,982
Scott: I Said you might think of the day.

472
00:32:22,002 --> 00:32:22,446
Scott: What was it?

473
00:32:24,474 --> 00:32:24,918
Scott: There it is.

474
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,550
Scott: It's a real simple little Instagram.

475
00:32:26,631 --> 00:32:43,468
Scott: This guy was biking to work yeah in New York on the west side bike path like you do and he's got a camera on his thing like you do and He encounters a real-life Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle on his bike ride to work because they live in New York.

476
00:32:43,488 --> 00:32:46,233
Scott: That's where they're from And they're like.

477
00:32:46,273 --> 00:32:47,557
Scott: that's a rare sighting.

478
00:32:47,597 --> 00:32:50,807
Scott: that's like seeing like a super camouflaged owl during the day like you.

479
00:32:50,827 --> 00:32:57,183
Scott: don't see that shit right, so The fact that it was caught on video and post on Instagram is like pretty amazing.

480
00:32:57,704 --> 00:32:58,507
Scott: So check it out.

481
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:08,169
Rym: Yeah So in the meta moment, oh the book club book is Rebecca I'll probably read it on my trip and then we'll do the show right after I get back from Australia.

482
00:33:09,412 --> 00:33:12,793
Rym: Otherwise we had no conventions coming up until Magfest.

483
00:33:12,833 --> 00:33:16,226
Rym: but we will be at mag fest doing whole bunch of panels.

484
00:33:16,266 --> 00:33:17,250
Rym: We're part of the mages group.

485
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:18,656
Rym: We'll be at all that academic stuff.

486
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:19,781
Rym: Magfest is awesome.

487
00:33:19,801 --> 00:33:20,584
Rym: We're totally gonna be there.

488
00:33:20,604 --> 00:33:21,950
Rym: It's gonna be awesome as always.

489
00:33:22,391 --> 00:33:27,710
Rym: I also got the video of our most recent panel our packs panel on the grind from PAX West.

490
00:33:28,194 --> 00:33:46,562
Rym: I put the whole thing up on YouTube and actually Because of Atari game design which is also on YouTube now Which had probably a more complex pipeline because I had the camera angles But I also had to sync us actually playing Atari games live and all that stuff I took the time to actually make like a real video pipeline.

491
00:33:46,602 --> 00:33:52,090
Rym: so I can crank out panel video Way faster and higher quality than we've ever done before.

492
00:33:52,652 --> 00:33:58,010
Rym: So at least when we video our panels at PAX is you can expect them on YouTube like right away from now on.

493
00:33:59,211 --> 00:34:03,790
Rym: That is not the case for other conventions because the lighting in the rooms are so bad that usually the video is not worthwhile.

494
00:34:03,991 --> 00:34:06,729
Rym: But at least at PAX is that he was gonna be a real quick.

495
00:34:08,371 --> 00:34:15,422
Rym: Otherwise, yeah follow both means got on YouTube and Other places and I'm gonna be out of town in Australia for the next two weeks.

496
00:34:16,024 --> 00:34:26,190
Rym: So after the winds on me Yeah, after the Wednesday show will be gone for a while Emily and I might record podcasts of our Australia experiences for the patreon.

497
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:27,981
Scott: But otherwise, I'll do some streaming bits.

498
00:34:28,001 --> 00:34:29,268
Scott: I'm gonna get my stream going on.

499
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:34,879
Rym: Yeah, cuz you know, so GeekNights will be on momentary hiatus But we're both making a lot of other content.

500
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,585
Scott: come to my youtube channel instead.

501
00:34:36,987 --> 00:34:37,630
Rym: I'll have part two.

502
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:39,054
Rym: I'll have more parts of our.

503
00:34:39,234 --> 00:34:41,822
Rym: remember Scott said five series coming up this week as well.

504
00:34:42,342 --> 00:34:47,617
Rym: So also I am reading all of Castlevania to Simon's quest.

505
00:34:47,657 --> 00:34:50,989
Scott: you don't need that the novel ization, but I'm gonna make good content.

506
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,558
Scott: You're paying for that crap content.

507
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:54,690
Scott: I will give you good free content that you actually want.

508
00:34:54,911 --> 00:35:02,115
Rym: I'm pretty sure Timothy Bradley grabbed Simon Belmont's dick and then had an orgasm but I'll leave it up.

509
00:35:02,236 --> 00:35:02,397
Rym: Yes.

510
00:35:02,538 --> 00:35:03,464
Scott: This is what you're paying for.

511
00:35:03,484 --> 00:35:04,490
Rym: Are you sure that's what happened?

512
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:07,039
Scott: So by the way, gold a topic number 79.

513
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:07,520
Scott: Yep.

514
00:35:07,922 --> 00:35:09,166
Scott: Guess what number mercury is?

515
00:35:09,186 --> 00:35:10,923
Rym: Ah Fuck if I know.

516
00:35:13,151 --> 00:35:16,045
Scott: One just one proton more just one.

517
00:35:16,126 --> 00:35:21,700
Scott: and guess where lead is 82. oh man two more protons.

518
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,101
Scott: you got led.

519
00:35:22,141 --> 00:35:24,710
Scott: It's something they're all real close, but so different.

520
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:25,273
Scott: It's like the bad.

521
00:35:25,354 --> 00:35:28,290
Scott: imagine you got a bar of gold right and you got like a hundred gold atoms.

522
00:35:28,852 --> 00:35:31,560
Scott: You just should add a hundred protons and now you got a hundred mercury atoms.

523
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:31,921
Scott: It's crazy.

524
00:35:32,583 --> 00:35:33,205
Scott: It's like it just.

525
00:35:33,306 --> 00:35:34,610
Scott: it's insane science.

526
00:35:36,572 --> 00:35:59,488
Rym: So two things that are sort of relevant to the show today is that one on January 1st 2015 New York City at least Passed a law where you cannot throw any of the following things away in the garbage TVs monitors computers laptops small servers printers scanners tablets e-readers mp3 players mice keyboards Video game consoles VCR.

527
00:35:59,951 --> 00:36:05,650
Scott: Yeah, so people don't might not know this but like when I lived in the burbs we had private trash pickup.

528
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:06,233
Scott: You had that's cuz.

529
00:36:06,254 --> 00:36:07,622
Rym: you lived in a fucked up place.

530
00:36:07,642 --> 00:36:08,950
Scott: You had to pay a private.

531
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:11,710
Scott: There's a lot of place every time I know and I think those places are all fucked up.

532
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:13,489
Rym: You know trash is the only way to go.

533
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:33,316
Scott: I think it's most places in the US but basically you had to pay Somebody who owned a dump truck to come to your house Pick up your trash and then take it to the public dump or disposal place for you Cuz or you could do it yourself if you really wanted to like, you know Use your own truck to bring your trash to the the transfer station or wherever it is, you know You could do that.

534
00:36:33,377 --> 00:36:34,790
Scott: You didn't have to pay someone to do it.

535
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:39,726
Scott: But there was no town owned dump truck that would come and pick up trash for you.

536
00:36:40,127 --> 00:36:49,955
Scott: in New York City You had the Department of Sanitation which cleans the streets comes and gets the trash pretty much takes care of everything And your taxes pay for it.

537
00:36:50,276 --> 00:36:55,806
Scott: so they can have a law like this because there isn't some private company That's gonna say yeah, I'll take your TV.

538
00:36:56,853 --> 00:37:01,876
Scott: They come into the side of the street and they see a TV sitting there and they say fuck No, and they put a sticker on it.

539
00:37:02,117 --> 00:37:04,648
Scott: And if it's still there you get a fine and you know, you get in trouble.

540
00:37:04,708 --> 00:37:11,229
Scott: So You know because we have this public Department of Sanitation we have laws like this.

541
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,175
Scott: No What you can and cannot throw away.

542
00:37:13,195 --> 00:37:17,950
Rym: it got more complicated because you know complex CFLs replaced incandescent bulbs.

543
00:37:18,311 --> 00:37:19,617
Scott: They got mercury in them shit.

544
00:37:19,718 --> 00:37:22,410
Scott: Yeah, and now we got LEDs that I'm glad it were short-lived.

545
00:37:22,591 --> 00:37:24,618
Rym: No, I can tell you're kind of oh, it's.

546
00:37:25,019 --> 00:37:27,026
Rym: it seems like it's legal to just throw them away.

547
00:37:27,087 --> 00:37:28,010
Rym: It's just discouraged.

548
00:37:28,191 --> 00:37:29,984
Rym: Yeah, it depends on like where you are.

549
00:37:30,084 --> 00:37:30,789
Rym: I don't throw them away.

550
00:37:31,051 --> 00:37:34,568
Rym: no, even though theoretically residential buildings in New York have to handle that shit.

551
00:37:34,648 --> 00:37:39,768
Rym: like I Took our printer because I could I went to the thing with the e-waste recycling thing and I took all our like.

552
00:37:39,808 --> 00:37:40,130
Rym: all our see.

553
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:41,457
Scott: If I went I took a lot of stuff there.

554
00:37:41,477 --> 00:37:43,590
Scott: It's like empty propane cans and CFLs.

555
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:48,085
Rym: Well, I took a backpack filled to the brim with old batteries and CFLs.

556
00:37:48,125 --> 00:37:52,019
Scott: Yeah, but It's a lead at his last battery over there.

557
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:54,430
Rym: I took a lead as a battery over there the one that was in my files.

558
00:37:54,711 --> 00:37:56,778
Scott: Yeah, I took the one that was used to be in my UPS.

559
00:37:56,818 --> 00:37:57,641
Scott: that broke open.

560
00:37:57,982 --> 00:38:02,694
Rym: Oh, I forgot to take the fucking UPS UPS under here.

561
00:38:02,714 --> 00:38:06,148
Rym: my computer's plugged into it, but the battery has been dead for two years.

562
00:38:06,168 --> 00:38:07,791
Rym: I just haven't Extricated.

563
00:38:07,811 --> 00:38:11,650
Scott: I bought a replacement battery for my UPS and Amazon and it's only had to take the battery over there.

564
00:38:12,392 --> 00:38:13,677
Rym: I don't care anymore because I've.

565
00:38:13,757 --> 00:38:15,764
Rym: we've never had a power outage since I moved in.

566
00:38:15,825 --> 00:38:22,128
Scott: Your line has clicked frequently Really yeah, I mean over the years it is never happened.

567
00:38:22,148 --> 00:38:23,152
Rym: in this apart It never even went.

568
00:38:23,213 --> 00:38:24,117
Scott: click click whenever.

569
00:38:24,558 --> 00:38:27,250
Scott: I mean, I've heard it go click click even though the power is still just fine.

570
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:29,099
Rym: Yeah, I've never had that happen.

571
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:33,738
Rym: It's also good to have you know, yeah I just don't care anymore because one in the modern era.

572
00:38:33,758 --> 00:38:37,230
Scott: I mean the battery caused less than like 20 bucks.

573
00:38:37,311 --> 00:38:39,025
Scott: Oh, yeah, I'm really gonna buy a $20 power strip.

574
00:38:39,811 --> 00:38:42,409
Rym: I mean what you know, well, I mean I buy like the cheap one.

575
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:44,923
Rym: I have enough power strips last me my entire life at this point.

576
00:38:44,963 --> 00:38:45,486
Scott: Yeah, whatever.

577
00:38:45,989 --> 00:38:51,453
Rym: but So basically even though I can throw those things away I don't.

578
00:38:51,835 --> 00:38:58,375
Rym: because even if there is theoretically a chain of custody where all the people in that chain will Treat them with the proper respect.

579
00:38:58,776 --> 00:39:01,985
Rym: I'm pretty sure they'll just get broken open and mercury gets everywhere.

580
00:39:02,587 --> 00:39:03,630
Rym: and I guess I'm a good person.

581
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:04,854
Scott: Yeah, that's another thing in New York.

582
00:39:04,915 --> 00:39:07,263
Scott: Is it any place where you're in a large building?

583
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:14,550
Rym: right if you're in, you know your large Residential building or even a commercial building most commercial buildings seem to just fucking ignore this.

584
00:39:14,791 --> 00:39:21,882
Scott: What I'm saying is that if you live in your own house and you bring your own trash to the curb if there's any Separation required you're taking care of it, right?

585
00:39:22,264 --> 00:39:25,039
Scott: But if you're in a building It's up to the like.

586
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:26,270
Scott: the building can just fuck you over.

587
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:33,082
Scott: You could be spending hours like separating your recycling and separating your paper from your plastic and set me know and then your building I'll just dumps it in the same place.

588
00:39:33,102 --> 00:39:34,856
Scott: because they don't give a shit You know, at least are lazy.

589
00:39:34,876 --> 00:39:47,467
Rym: because one thing is then this is like more in recycling But in general the right way to go is to have the single stream recycling where the recycling stream itself Like downstream from you will separate so you don't have to.

590
00:39:47,669 --> 00:39:50,399
Rym: yeah Because then more people are willing to recycle like in New York.

591
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,690
Rym: They tell you put all plastics in the recycling.

592
00:39:53,811 --> 00:39:58,350
Scott: Yeah, even if they're not recyclable because and I think in New York you can actually recycle all plastics.

593
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:03,370
Rym: Well, so the secret is a lot of those individual plastics get separated and still landfilled.

594
00:40:03,852 --> 00:40:15,850
Rym: the reason they're separated is that if the technology gets better or if Demand for those plastics changes to make it economically viable instead of telling everyone Okay, now you can recycle number nine, but not number seven.

595
00:40:16,435 --> 00:40:18,190
Rym: They can just they don't have to tell you shit.

596
00:40:18,591 --> 00:40:23,930
Rym: All they do is take the number nine that was going in the garbage and just redirect it at the facilities into the stream.

597
00:40:24,292 --> 00:40:30,785
Rym: Mmm, so like it's a great thing, but my building Handles all the separation of all the other stuff downstairs.

598
00:40:30,846 --> 00:40:31,509
Rym: I see him doing it.

599
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:38,809
Rym: So I just take all our recyclables in a box to throw it down there and there's someone whose job it is every week to Separate everything out and deal with it.

600
00:40:39,071 --> 00:40:44,658
Scott: I take all my trash and I throw it down the hole and I take anything that's not trash and I separate it and put On the floor in the trash room.

601
00:40:45,121 --> 00:40:46,790
Rym: Oh, we're not allowed to put stuff in the trash room.

602
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:47,452
Rym: I gotta take it down.

603
00:40:47,492 --> 00:40:56,922
Scott: specifically says like if it's glass if it's recyclable if it's like smelly food Don't throw it down the hole Just put it on the floor in the trash room and then someone will take care of.

604
00:40:57,183 --> 00:40:58,950
Rym: smelly food specifically goes down the hole.

605
00:40:59,117 --> 00:41:08,817
Scott: Yeah Anyway, but the thing is is that I've seen at least once a piece of paper by the front door That was a fine from the sanitation department.

606
00:41:08,837 --> 00:41:13,150
Scott: that said hey you put something that was recyclable in the trash.

607
00:41:14,575 --> 00:41:15,449
Scott: You're getting a fine.

608
00:41:15,511 --> 00:41:18,999
Scott: so I don't know if somebody Tossed paper down the hole or something.

609
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:24,397
Rym: the only cardboard I throw down the hole because you're not supposed to is Grease-soaked pizza boxes because that's not recyclable.

610
00:41:24,758 --> 00:41:26,743
Scott: Mm-hmm, but it lit off though.

611
00:41:26,763 --> 00:41:27,586
Scott: That's not grease.

612
00:41:28,067 --> 00:41:28,969
Rym: Oh, yeah usually is.

613
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:42,250
Rym: But the other side piece of this is that or every time I build a computer as almost everyone does You get all your components and you get a bunch of extra shit mostly with your case or your motherboard.

614
00:41:42,431 --> 00:41:46,310
Scott: Yeah, I mean you get screws you get this parts that you take off like you take off something.

615
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:50,130
Scott: Maybe you don't have an optical drive anymore, but you used to take off a piece of plastic from the front.

616
00:41:50,251 --> 00:41:51,770
Scott: It's the optical drive could stick out.

617
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:53,677
Rym: You used to take off like you put your video card.

618
00:41:53,697 --> 00:42:01,510
Rym: you take those little metal shields off the back and in the CI slots Like in the days when you would buy cards for extra functionality, which really don't do anymore except video.

619
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:03,037
Scott: Yeah, there's all sorts of extra cables.

620
00:42:03,057 --> 00:42:03,640
Scott: You don't use like.

621
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,629
Scott: you get 10 sat cables and only use two.

622
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:10,410
Rym: Yeah, if you got a fancy case, it's got like different cages to hold different kinds of drives.

623
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:15,687
Scott: Evil ties is all those extra bits that don't actually end up in the computer.

624
00:42:15,707 --> 00:42:22,710
Scott: and You know you throw most of it away or recycle most of it But there's still leftover bits that it's like I got to keep these screws.

625
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:25,721
Scott: What if one day I got to add a PCI card to this computer?

626
00:42:25,802 --> 00:42:27,528
Scott: or what if one day I got a?

627
00:42:27,769 --> 00:42:27,950
Scott: you know?

628
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:28,976
Scott: Do something here.

629
00:42:29,017 --> 00:42:30,828
Scott: I'm gonna need these screws and you keep them somewhere.

630
00:42:30,889 --> 00:42:31,833
Rym: Yep So I would.

631
00:42:31,913 --> 00:42:38,743
Rym: I have a motherboard box from every computer I've ever built pretty much worth of because I always put in the motherboard Box, it's just like because that's the empty box.

632
00:42:38,783 --> 00:42:39,689
Rym: I happen to have laying there.

633
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:41,749
Rym: I put all that stuff in a box.

634
00:42:42,272 --> 00:42:44,862
Scott: I have a drawer in my little stack of drawers, but then that stuff.

635
00:42:44,943 --> 00:42:53,018
Rym: the next time I build a computer I take the previous box and I open it and I have it sitting next to me while I'm building the new computer cuz like Hey, maybe I need a part.

636
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:57,521
Rym: Yeah in my whole life Other than SATA and PETA cables.

637
00:42:58,184 --> 00:43:02,626
Rym: I don't think I have ever Take it apart from that box and used it ever.

638
00:43:03,772 --> 00:43:07,165
Scott: so there's two reasons that you know, I've used stuff from there right.

639
00:43:07,507 --> 00:43:10,415
Scott: number one is I'm doing some upgrade.

640
00:43:10,696 --> 00:43:11,419
Scott: I wish I had it.

641
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,350
Scott: So why I upgraded like the video card in my current desktop?

642
00:43:14,932 --> 00:43:16,330
Scott: Uh, it was a current one or the previous.

643
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:21,286
Scott: I upgraded a video card at one point and boy was I glad to have that stuff still there not thrown out.

644
00:43:21,948 --> 00:43:28,590
Scott: and two sometimes you need give someone a computer and You know, they're gonna rejigger that whole computer a lot.

645
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:37,970
Scott: maybe they're gonna mount some drives or unmount some drives and they will be very happy to have the screws that go with that case and The plastic bits that go with that case and the mounting equipment that goes with that case.

646
00:43:38,211 --> 00:43:40,448
Scott: Yeah, and they'll be very sad to not have it like.

647
00:43:40,488 --> 00:43:44,958
Scott: wow I want to add a hard drive to this computer But I can't get Scott throughout all the rails that he wasn't using.

648
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:49,070
Rym: but I decided because I've never used this stuff anymore.

649
00:43:49,472 --> 00:43:59,150
Rym: I'm gonna do a purge and when I build my new computer, I'm going to dispose of Every single computer building component that I have that is not used in that new computer.

650
00:44:00,071 --> 00:44:00,653
Scott: I'd keep some.

651
00:44:01,356 --> 00:44:03,684
Rym: all I'm gonna keep is a handful of SATA cables.

652
00:44:03,704 --> 00:44:05,070
Scott: Don't come asking for anything from me.

653
00:44:05,871 --> 00:44:10,287
Rym: I'm confident based on my entire life experience that I will never need anything.

654
00:44:10,307 --> 00:44:11,873
Scott: You'll buy a hard drive You'll want to mount it.

655
00:44:11,913 --> 00:44:13,258
Scott: You won't have a mounting bracket.

656
00:44:13,699 --> 00:44:17,395
Rym: So I be so I'm doing something different with my new computer, too One.

657
00:44:17,476 --> 00:44:18,201
Rym: it's a new computer.

658
00:44:18,242 --> 00:44:19,310
Rym: So it has its own mounting stuff.

659
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:21,849
Rym: So the case is gonna come with like all the mounting stuff I'll ever need.

660
00:44:22,692 --> 00:44:25,109
Rym: So I'm gonna keep the stuff from the new case and throw away everything old.

661
00:44:26,932 --> 00:44:29,223
Scott: What if someone wants to mount something in that old computer?

662
00:44:29,745 --> 00:44:30,508
Rym: I just don't care.

663
00:44:32,053 --> 00:44:35,629
Rym: Also, there's like six hard drives in that computer so you've already got enough stuff in there.

664
00:44:38,111 --> 00:44:45,370
Scott: My new HD PC is great by the way, and the case is even smaller and it's so much faster.

665
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:46,373
Scott: It's like the best computer.

666
00:44:46,413 --> 00:44:48,660
Rym: Yeah, my HD PC is like early 2009 circa and it's like a core i3.

667
00:44:53,071 --> 00:44:59,135
Scott: It's really the only thing keeping my current HD PC from being like the best desktop in the universe is that I didn't.

668
00:44:59,356 --> 00:45:05,540
Scott: it only has two RAM slots, so I couldn't load it up to all the way and It can't hold really that many hard drives at all.

669
00:45:06,022 --> 00:45:07,428
Scott: It has like one tiny hard drive.

670
00:45:07,468 --> 00:45:07,870
Scott: That's it.

671
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:10,237
Scott: So but other than that, it's like incredible.

672
00:45:10,278 --> 00:45:11,261
Scott: It's like it's an i5 or the 1070s.

673
00:45:11,321 --> 00:45:11,762
Scott: So it's great.

674
00:45:14,855 --> 00:45:20,863
Rym: So what I'm very seven years out if these kbla I think I mentioned this if the kbla chips perform as well as people said they are for video.

675
00:45:21,365 --> 00:45:32,461
Rym: I'm gonna get like a Tiny HDPC like one of those little baby Specially built like super tiny computers that has just like and I'm not to drive sticking it into RAM No video card at all.

676
00:45:32,562 --> 00:45:33,310
Rym: No video card at all.

677
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:40,596
Rym: I don't trust I can play a lot of games on my 2009 era laptop But I'm having a 1070 on.

678
00:45:40,637 --> 00:45:47,626
Scott: the HD PC is so great because like I can play every game Full frames at 1080 with max settings.

679
00:45:47,667 --> 00:45:48,250
Scott: No problem.

680
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:53,716
Scott: So the other and if I get a 4k TV and like a couple years when they're not bullshit when there's no when there's A reason to have them.

681
00:45:54,462 --> 00:45:55,350
Scott: It'll still be great.

682
00:45:55,611 --> 00:45:56,857
Rym: So what'd you do with the old HDPC?

683
00:45:56,877 --> 00:45:59,550
Rym: because I guess that's the topic of the show cuz I got a debate.

684
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:00,996
Scott: What is the topic of the show?

685
00:46:01,076 --> 00:46:03,064
Scott: and you know what that is a perfectly good computer.

686
00:46:03,084 --> 00:46:04,229
Scott: It is a is an i3.

687
00:46:04,891 --> 00:46:08,609
Scott: It's not like four gigs of RAM, which isn't as much but I think you could put more in there.

688
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:15,249
Scott: It's you know, it's got a hard of one terabyte magnetic hard drive Which you could should probably replace in the SSD because it's really slow.

689
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:16,193
Scott: Yeah, but it works.

690
00:46:16,997 --> 00:46:23,510
Scott: and it's got an old low-profile ATI video card Which can actually play some games at decent frame rates.

691
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:26,825
Scott: It just has some trouble with newer things or putting on high settings.

692
00:46:26,865 --> 00:46:31,902
Scott: as long as you keep your settings low Or your resolution low or your frame rates low or your games old.

693
00:46:32,563 --> 00:46:33,627
Scott: It's just fine.

694
00:46:34,008 --> 00:46:34,730
Rym: But do you have a plan?

695
00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:35,594
Rym: What are you gonna do with it?

696
00:46:35,615 --> 00:46:36,238
Rym: plays in there?

697
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:38,130
Scott: Yeah, it's just sitting there looking for a home.

698
00:46:38,331 --> 00:46:42,310
Rym: So I think this is a relatively new problem because I realized I was thinking about this in my whole life.

699
00:46:42,411 --> 00:46:43,729
Scott: Maybe I can find a place to donate it.

700
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:46,344
Scott: Does anyone like know where to donate working computers?

701
00:46:46,645 --> 00:46:49,076
Rym: because I was you know Because I would die wasn't rich.

702
00:46:49,116 --> 00:46:53,481
Scott: thing is the case is actually, you know, it's a really nice, you know HTPC case.

703
00:46:53,501 --> 00:46:54,269
Scott: there's nothing wrong with it.

704
00:46:54,450 --> 00:47:00,170
Rym: It's like worth a lot actually, but computers used to be a lot more unreliable and components would fail a lot more off.

705
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:02,529
Scott: That's because we were buying AMD computers in that era.

706
00:47:02,871 --> 00:47:06,130
Scott: But also just like Intel computers I've had have always been super reliable.

707
00:47:06,313 --> 00:47:13,769
Rym: But for most of my life I generally only started speccing out and then building a new computer when the old one was dying or dead.

708
00:47:14,652 --> 00:47:19,545
Rym: But nowadays I have to upgrade the computer I'm using because it's not fast enough.

709
00:47:19,585 --> 00:47:20,628
Rym: same with the HTPC.

710
00:47:20,648 --> 00:47:21,470
Rym: same with my laptop.

711
00:47:21,874 --> 00:47:33,650
Rym: Yeah only after six or seven years though Yeah but now I have all these computers like a lot of them that I'm gonna basically have nothing to do with that are 100% fine and they're actually pretty fast.

712
00:47:33,831 --> 00:47:38,470
Rym: They're just not fast enough for me and I'm not sure what to do with like this computer.

713
00:47:38,591 --> 00:47:47,314
Scott: If you're a person who needs an HTPC and you are just gonna watch video Like you're not even gonna play any serious games or you're only gonna play like nice 2d games It could be your desktop.

714
00:47:47,414 --> 00:47:48,238
Scott: You could even play.

715
00:47:48,299 --> 00:47:50,670
Scott: it could be like it could be a great desktop.

716
00:47:51,132 --> 00:47:54,430
Scott: It could be like your ultimate the ultimate HTPC for so many people.

717
00:47:54,932 --> 00:47:56,157
Scott: But just for me, it just.

718
00:47:56,358 --> 00:47:59,130
Scott: I couldn't put a better video card in it because it's a low-profile case.

719
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:03,330
Scott: Yep, so I replaced it, but it's perfectly awesome for anyone else.

720
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:09,230
Rym: So in the old old old days if I had a working computer, I always had all these projects.

721
00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:11,581
Rym: So I would immediately turn it into a server of some kind.

722
00:48:11,882 --> 00:48:12,907
Scott: also, you need a Windows license.

723
00:48:12,927 --> 00:48:13,490
Scott: cuz I erased it.

724
00:48:14,072 --> 00:48:20,078
Rym: I'm gonna erase it but I would always put like any computer I had that was spare was like, holy shit I have a spare computer.

725
00:48:20,321 --> 00:48:21,109
Rym: What am I gonna do with it?

726
00:48:21,351 --> 00:48:24,743
Rym: And I would just like install software on it and like run the servers on it.

727
00:48:25,064 --> 00:48:30,823
Rym: I just run a counter-strike server Now I just don't bother games don't need that anymore.

728
00:48:30,923 --> 00:48:32,149
Rym: Everything's online and easy.

729
00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:34,156
Rym: Like there's like.

730
00:48:34,176 --> 00:48:36,710
Rym: I'm not gonna host a server on files here in the apart.

731
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:49,770
Scott: Yeah, I think an RIT my old computer became a web server and then in beacon the old computer became HTPC and another old computer became DNS DHCP Yep, and yet another old computer was a counter-strike server that I ran for a while that no one use.

732
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:51,710
Scott: It's like we kept doing stuff with old computers.

733
00:48:51,810 --> 00:48:56,707
Scott: But now I only need two PCs the desktop and the HTPC.

734
00:48:56,747 --> 00:48:57,490
Scott: I don't need any more.

735
00:48:57,718 --> 00:49:06,998
Rym: Yeah and what's interesting is all the other technology because you know in general like like I have all these electronics that are 100% functional and that I use occasionally.

736
00:49:07,379 --> 00:49:08,863
Rym: but I've bought better versions of like.

737
00:49:09,144 --> 00:49:10,608
Rym: we have these fancy microphones.

738
00:49:10,648 --> 00:49:11,190
Rym: we bought right.

739
00:49:11,672 --> 00:49:13,479
Rym: We bought them to upgrade from the old.

740
00:49:13,941 --> 00:49:16,250
Rym: good, but now we have money and we know what we're doing.

741
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:19,501
Rym: We're getting better microphones microphones those old microphones.

742
00:49:19,602 --> 00:49:20,083
Rym: The sm57s are fine.

743
00:49:22,512 --> 00:49:24,742
Rym: They're literally as good as they were when we bought them.

744
00:49:25,284 --> 00:49:28,899
Scott: We just don't use them Good use them as someone comes over to record.

745
00:49:28,919 --> 00:49:29,682
Scott: Yeah, we need them.

746
00:49:30,084 --> 00:49:31,490
Scott: What about the Radio Shack ones?

747
00:49:32,114 --> 00:49:33,321
Rym: Those I think I just threw away.

748
00:49:33,342 --> 00:49:34,610
Scott: Yeah, you're so wasteful.

749
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:37,298
Rym: Yeah, those those were terrible microphones.

750
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:40,388
Rym: like they were not worth any amount of money.

751
00:49:40,508 --> 00:49:42,842
Rym: in retrospect We were better off with the Logitech.

752
00:49:42,862 --> 00:49:44,912
Rym: because I've listened to the old GeekNights I've been remastering them.

753
00:49:44,932 --> 00:49:51,590
Rym: those Radio Shack microphones were worse than the Logitech stick mic because they cost any amount of money and they weren't better.

754
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:57,485
Rym: But like all the mixers we've gone through a bunch of mixers and I gave away.

755
00:49:57,605 --> 00:50:03,434
Rym: every time we upgraded the GeekNights mixer I gave away the previous mixer to someone and They used it.

756
00:50:03,454 --> 00:50:05,309
Rym: as far as I can tell I hope they used it.

757
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:09,970
Rym: Yeah, in fact, I gave the old the last analog mixer the giant one that we used to bring to conventions.

758
00:50:10,393 --> 00:50:11,825
Rym: I gave that to one of our old doorman.

759
00:50:12,931 --> 00:50:13,834
Rym: He's like an aspiring DJ.

760
00:50:13,894 --> 00:50:15,320
Rym: I was like, hey you want this giant mixer?

761
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:16,023
Rym: and he was like, fuck.

762
00:50:16,063 --> 00:50:16,404
Rym: Yeah.

763
00:50:16,645 --> 00:50:17,910
Scott: All right, go for it, dude.

764
00:50:19,111 --> 00:50:20,822
Scott: So he'll saw it on Craigslist or something.

765
00:50:20,842 --> 00:50:22,050
Rym: I think he was using it.

766
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:22,904
Rym: I think he wanted to use it.

767
00:50:23,087 --> 00:50:27,102
Rym: good But most of the tech I have seems worthless.

768
00:50:27,182 --> 00:50:29,510
Rym: that even though it's perfectly functional.

769
00:50:30,293 --> 00:50:35,747
Rym: most of it No one would want and I can't come up with good ways to get rid of it.

770
00:50:35,767 --> 00:50:37,957
Rym: Mm-hmm I don't know what to do about that.

771
00:50:37,977 --> 00:50:39,766
Scott: You go on the old list of Craig.

772
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:43,782
Scott: Yeah, but that's Facebook just launched a Craigslist competitor today.

773
00:50:43,802 --> 00:50:45,830
Rym: Yeah, and I'm thinking maybe I'll use that right.

774
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:46,755
Scott: So actually this happened.

775
00:50:46,875 --> 00:50:48,262
Rym: we could do the GeekNights Luke, right?

776
00:50:48,504 --> 00:50:49,750
Scott: So this happened to me today, right?

777
00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:54,249
Scott: So I'm not a big fan of worst buy or the store that is not the best buy.

778
00:50:54,571 --> 00:50:59,249
Scott: Yeah, right, but I'm trying to get rid of my iPhone 6 cuz I just got the iPhone 7, right?

779
00:50:59,650 --> 00:51:00,910
Scott: Yeah, I just talked about the beginning the show.

780
00:51:00,990 --> 00:51:04,410
Scott: So, you know I could sell it on Craigslist or eBay or something.

781
00:51:04,511 --> 00:51:05,378
Scott: It's a pain in the ass.

782
00:51:05,418 --> 00:51:06,890
Scott: and this places you can do it online.

783
00:51:07,072 --> 00:51:08,727
Scott: Amazon will give you a gift card, right?

784
00:51:09,852 --> 00:51:12,521
Scott: This website giselle.com and there's some other ones.

785
00:51:12,962 --> 00:51:14,247
Scott: be like mail them your phone.

786
00:51:14,287 --> 00:51:18,510
Scott: They evaluate it They give you a quote you either accept it or they send you your phone back.

787
00:51:18,611 --> 00:51:19,628
Scott: It's a pain in the ass, too.

788
00:51:20,573 --> 00:51:27,228
Scott: so Best Buy apparently You can bring your phone in they'll look at it in the store and give you a gift card.

789
00:51:27,288 --> 00:51:33,326
Scott: and I'm like Well, you know while I don't like worst buy that's really fucking convenient.

790
00:51:33,366 --> 00:51:38,201
Scott: It's right near my work and The GoPro Hero 5 is out and I'm buying one high up.

791
00:51:38,482 --> 00:51:39,466
Scott: So they've got it.

792
00:51:39,486 --> 00:51:40,490
Scott: They've got it in the store today.

793
00:51:40,651 --> 00:51:42,683
Scott: Actually, I'm like, well, they give me the gift card.

794
00:51:42,723 --> 00:51:43,749
Scott: I can just buy it right here.

795
00:51:44,292 --> 00:51:47,126
Scott: I mean, I'd rather buy it on Amazon, but hey, right?

796
00:51:47,186 --> 00:51:47,890
Scott: Why the fuck not?

797
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:51,384
Scott: It's like, you know turn my iPhone 6 into a GoPro shade something.

798
00:51:51,445 --> 00:51:52,710
Scott: I don't need any more for something.

799
00:51:52,770 --> 00:51:53,874
Scott: I do need great deal.

800
00:51:54,355 --> 00:51:55,017
Scott: What do I care?

801
00:51:55,097 --> 00:51:59,090
Scott: So I was surprised by a great many things at the worst buy.

802
00:51:59,332 --> 00:52:03,805
Rym: Well, I've not been inside a Best Buy in More than five years.

803
00:52:03,825 --> 00:52:16,710
Scott: Yes So the first thing I was very surprised by is that the staff in the cell phone area of the worst buy Were Scarily knowledgeable about phones particularly this this the girl who was like taking care of me.

804
00:52:17,151 --> 00:52:18,958
Scott: It's like everyone kept coming to ask her shit.

805
00:52:18,998 --> 00:52:21,768
Scott: Like this dude was like, hey, is there like a 4g phone?

806
00:52:22,691 --> 00:52:23,736
Scott: that's like less than $100.

807
00:52:23,736 --> 00:52:24,880
Scott: like does this one come in red?

808
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:28,374
Scott: and like she just knew everything about like every phone ever and She was there.

809
00:52:28,394 --> 00:52:30,669
Scott: and then so after she evaluates my phone for a bit.

810
00:52:31,252 --> 00:52:38,556
Scott: She's like, alright Best Buy is gonna give you like 70 bucks for this and I'm like, that's not so great But it's a not a hassle.

811
00:52:38,737 --> 00:52:39,901
Rym: you took it didn't ya know?

812
00:52:40,001 --> 00:52:44,253
Scott: I was thinking about taking it and then she was like listen Don't take it.

813
00:52:44,534 --> 00:52:45,920
Rym: She like I'll give you 80 bucks for it.

814
00:52:46,021 --> 00:52:47,005
Scott: No, she's like.

815
00:52:47,286 --> 00:52:49,676
Scott: she's like, you know The screen has some scratches on.

816
00:52:49,696 --> 00:52:51,705
Scott: I'm like, yeah, cuz it was my phone for two years.

817
00:52:51,725 --> 00:52:55,018
Scott: It's not a perfect screen It's you know got normal wear and tear on it.

818
00:52:55,038 --> 00:52:55,480
Scott: What's the problem?

819
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:56,504
Scott: You know, what are you expecting?

820
00:52:56,625 --> 00:52:57,910
Scott: brand new shiny phones from two?

821
00:52:58,010 --> 00:52:59,397
Scott: Years ago, but she's like.

822
00:52:59,417 --> 00:53:02,150
Scott: you could just sell this like anywhere and get way more money for it.

823
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:11,152
Scott: But I'm like, that's such a pain in the ass, though And she's like, all right Look just go somewhere else and if you really if it's too much of a pain in the ass come back and I'll give you the $75.

824
00:53:11,152 --> 00:53:16,611
Scott: Yeah, and the other dude standing next to her was like seriously go use the Giselle calm Like.

825
00:53:17,114 --> 00:53:17,678
Scott: I'm like really?

826
00:53:17,759 --> 00:53:18,161
Scott: All right.

827
00:53:18,423 --> 00:53:19,390
Scott: It's like they really didn't.

828
00:53:20,431 --> 00:53:25,188
Scott: They were really looking out for the customer and not looking out for Best Buy at all in the cell phone department.

829
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:27,937
Rym: Well They're not getting paid that much.

830
00:53:27,978 --> 00:53:30,230
Scott: No, but I'm saying is like look it was a real.

831
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:32,010
Scott: It's a real hassle to get rid of this fucking phone.

832
00:53:32,071 --> 00:53:33,290
Scott: So I did the Amazon thing.

833
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:40,100
Scott: So I'm gonna mail it to Amazon and I checked the box that said listen Amazon if you're gonna give me less money for it Don't give me money.

834
00:53:40,463 --> 00:53:41,289
Scott: Just send it back.

835
00:53:42,292 --> 00:53:46,610
Scott: But hopefully they'll give me Amazon credit for it and it supposedly will be like 200 something dollars.

836
00:53:46,751 --> 00:53:56,970
Rym: So interestingly if they like the phone up until my Nexus 5 Every smartphone I've ever had I replaced it because it broke to the point that it was unusable.

837
00:53:57,171 --> 00:53:58,217
Scott: I wonder how that happened.

838
00:53:58,518 --> 00:54:08,730
Rym: also because you bought not iPhones or Because I Upgraded because the old phone was literally completely obsolete like my palm free or my Nexus S?

839
00:54:08,770 --> 00:54:12,212
Scott: Well all my previous iPhones I see the MA Nexus I think.

840
00:54:12,252 --> 00:54:17,085
Scott: I think I handed down my 3g and my 4 and I what did?

841
00:54:17,105 --> 00:54:19,274
Scott: I think I handed down the 5 to someone Else.

842
00:54:19,476 --> 00:54:20,849
Rym: I gave my Nexus 5 to friends.

843
00:54:22,052 --> 00:54:24,403
Rym: My Nexus 4 I also gave to a friend.

844
00:54:24,443 --> 00:54:25,930
Rym: even though the screens broken the phone works.

845
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:27,790
Scott: So guys I basically handed down.

846
00:54:27,870 --> 00:54:34,071
Scott: I've only had this is only my fourth iPhone 3g 4 5 6 7 1 2 3 4 5 6.

847
00:54:34,071 --> 00:54:35,119
Scott: This is my fifth iPhone.

848
00:54:35,139 --> 00:54:36,390
Scott: So I've gotten rid of four phones.

849
00:54:36,551 --> 00:54:39,306
Scott: So like my next I think I handed down 3 and did something else.

850
00:54:39,366 --> 00:54:41,177
Scott: at the other one My Nexus S was low.

851
00:54:41,217 --> 00:54:43,390
Scott: No, I handed down 3 and I've got the fourth one.

852
00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:44,373
Scott: I'm trying to get rid of it.

853
00:54:44,533 --> 00:54:49,167
Rym: My Nexus S was both locked to sprint and CDMA only as it was literally worthless.

854
00:54:49,408 --> 00:54:50,030
Rym: my palm free.

855
00:54:51,098 --> 00:54:51,590
Rym: So it sucks.

856
00:54:51,691 --> 00:55:03,369
Rym: But unless you root it Which is a giant pain in the ass Even though that would be a perfectly fine like remote control like it has Wi-Fi like you just use it You can't activate it without connecting to servers that don't exist anymore.

857
00:55:04,432 --> 00:55:15,324
Rym: So unless I root it and I went online and all the ways to root a palm free Involve using shady ass software that if you install that on a computer I think you're a moron you can start in a virtual machine.

858
00:55:15,706 --> 00:55:18,093
Scott: even then Spare computer.

859
00:55:18,113 --> 00:55:21,825
Scott: Yeah, I have a spare computer you could use for such things.

860
00:55:21,845 --> 00:55:23,069
Scott: Yeah, would you like it?

861
00:55:23,858 --> 00:55:25,876
Rym: I don't care enough Me either.

862
00:55:25,897 --> 00:55:27,451
Scott: That's why I just want to get rid of this shit Even.

863
00:55:27,511 --> 00:55:31,285
Rym: I guess the moral is all the all the non like all the technology.

864
00:55:31,305 --> 00:55:32,570
Rym: I have computers and other things.

865
00:55:33,232 --> 00:55:44,535
Rym: I pretty much almost always just give away things that work to friends who have worse things or I throw away And there's pretty much nothing else I do with old technology I get I need.

866
00:55:44,575 --> 00:55:57,030
Scott: there needs to be something better to do with it there because they like this You know Even though if I can't find the friends that need it There's people that need it as someone out there who can make a ton of use out of the HDVC and I just can't find Them and it's too much of a hassle to find them.

867
00:55:57,070 --> 00:56:06,470
Rym: Yeah especially because I remember we were trying to give stuff away in Craigslist, you know a long time ago and like People would email you and just like never respond when you're like, yeah, you can have it just come pick it up.

868
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:07,092
Rym: Here's your day.

869
00:56:07,514 --> 00:56:09,402
Scott: Oh, it's not easy to get rid of stuff.

870
00:56:09,442 --> 00:56:10,386
Scott: I'm trying to get rid of stuff.

871
00:56:10,466 --> 00:56:13,846
Scott: So Sign up for the GeekNights' crate.

872
00:56:14,028 --> 00:56:15,695
Rym: I guess You know.

873
00:56:15,996 --> 00:56:17,622
Scott: and the other thing is I'm a ship it to someone.

874
00:56:17,662 --> 00:56:19,930
Scott: the shipping cost is so high because it's big and heavy.

875
00:56:20,311 --> 00:56:21,215
Rym: So that was the thing.

876
00:56:21,255 --> 00:56:22,220
Rym: that was the experiment I did.

877
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:23,626
Rym: so we had an old pride bought a new.

878
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:32,366
Rym: we have a real color Laser printer now like a for real one up there like looming over me on the desk And the old printer barely worked and had a lot of problems.

879
00:56:32,426 --> 00:56:33,129
Rym: I was gonna throw it away.

880
00:56:34,834 --> 00:56:47,742
Rym: I wasn't gonna carry it on my bike to the Disposal amnesty thing so I put it downstairs with a regular garbage because our building theoretically will just handle it As an experiment to see if it remained there.

881
00:56:47,762 --> 00:56:49,989
Rym: if they brought it still there, isn't it?

882
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:54,412
Rym: If they brought it maybe they would bring it back up because it was in a box that our apartment number on it Like.

883
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:56,542
Rym: maybe they'd bring it up be like, yeah, you can't throw this away.

884
00:56:56,562 --> 00:56:58,110
Rym: I was just curious what would happen to it.

885
00:56:59,271 --> 00:57:00,275
Rym: So what do you think happened to it?

886
00:57:00,295 --> 00:57:00,837
Scott: It's still there.

887
00:57:01,138 --> 00:57:01,660
Rym: No, it's gone.

888
00:57:02,081 --> 00:57:04,410
Rym: Okay, and pretty sure they did it the right way.

889
00:57:04,912 --> 00:57:15,327
Rym: so Mm-hmm Apparently buildings can sign up for a thing where the city will take the eways and deal with it And big apartment buildings seem to just do it because people like us move into them and throw away technology all the time.

890
00:57:15,347 --> 00:57:21,730
Rym: Mm-hmm Was really happy though because when I went to that end that like throw away your eways.

891
00:57:22,173 --> 00:57:27,049
Scott: Yeah, this is a safe disposal event And what they do is they send everyone a piece of paper in the mail.

892
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:31,190
Scott: Yeah, it says on this this is the day and this is the place to bring your shit.

893
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:32,295
Scott: Here's the shit you can bring.

894
00:57:32,355 --> 00:57:33,319
Scott: is the shit you can't bring?

895
00:57:33,419 --> 00:57:39,370
Scott: you can do it year-round if you go to like these places But they're way out of the way comes to your neighborhood like once or twice a year, right?

896
00:57:39,732 --> 00:57:42,930
Scott: So I walked over there with my stuff in a bag and just handed it to them and walked away.

897
00:57:43,031 --> 00:57:44,950
Scott: But there was a line of cars down the street.

898
00:57:44,991 --> 00:57:53,150
Scott: Yeah That was with cones and there was a whole teams of people sorting everything like the people I interacted with were real pro.

899
00:57:54,152 --> 00:57:54,574
Rym: Yeah, like.

900
00:57:54,976 --> 00:57:57,265
Rym: he's like so much you got and I was like a bunch of stuff.

901
00:57:57,306 --> 00:57:58,350
Rym: He's like, alright, let's go one by one.

902
00:57:58,390 --> 00:58:01,949
Rym: I was like got a bunch of CFLs and he's like, alright, we'll take those and he took it.

903
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:03,034
Scott: They didn't even ask me.

904
00:58:03,054 --> 00:58:04,039
Scott: they were just like what you got.

905
00:58:04,099 --> 00:58:04,782
Scott: Alright, see you.

906
00:58:05,003 --> 00:58:05,345
Scott: You're good.

907
00:58:05,626 --> 00:58:05,867
Scott: Yep.

908
00:58:06,068 --> 00:58:06,389
Rym: Well, okay.

909
00:58:07,152 --> 00:58:19,469
Rym: So if someone came up next to me and they were like, so I got a bunch of scrap steel and a Bunch of paint and he was like, alright, I'll deal with the pain Wait here and we're gonna get a got it and they like did a thing.

910
00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:28,023
Rym: But they didn't check IDs of anyone who walked up or biked up and they were very thoroughly Checking the IDs of everyone who drove up.

911
00:58:28,183 --> 00:58:28,766
Scott: Oh, really?

912
00:58:28,847 --> 00:58:31,797
Rym: Yeah interesting Cuz I went around like I took some pictures like checking it out.

913
00:58:32,158 --> 00:58:35,730
Rym: the line of cars coming into this thing was crazy long.

914
00:58:36,051 --> 00:58:41,669
Scott: Well, cuz they bet it's so hard to get rid of your shit and they have an event like hey everyone all that shit You normally can't get rid of it for free.

915
00:58:41,871 --> 00:58:43,730
Scott: We're just gonna take it off your hands for free.

916
00:58:43,810 --> 00:58:45,497
Scott: All you have to do is bring it to this place.

917
00:58:45,557 --> 00:58:51,030
Scott: and this time you were a resident of New York City and it's like everyone Is like holy shit gotta bring my garbage.

918
00:58:51,451 --> 00:58:54,804
Rym: I saw him turn it away the fuck out of my house with Connecticut plates.

919
00:58:54,905 --> 00:58:55,748
Rym: cuz I stood there.

920
00:58:55,808 --> 00:59:05,634
Rym: really Yeah, Joe from Connecticut to his story drove in that a Connecticut plate and there's a dude and looked like his wife and he had all these pink hands in the Car.

921
00:59:06,197 --> 00:59:15,650
Scott: and but in Connecticut like, you know, my family's in Connecticut There's a transfer station that is open Every fucking day and you can go there everything for free or that there's some things you have to pay.

922
00:59:15,751 --> 00:59:17,643
Scott: We never had to pay when we went there.

923
00:59:17,683 --> 00:59:18,690
Rym: There's a transfer station.

924
00:59:18,792 --> 00:59:22,329
Rym: I remember in upstate New York There was a limit on how much you could bring to them.

925
00:59:22,510 --> 00:59:26,810
Scott: So the transfer station is actually really fun to go to because they have this gigantic trash compactor.

926
00:59:26,931 --> 00:59:29,462
Scott: It looks like something it would be like in a movie at the end like

927
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:30,688
Rym: at the end of the Brave Little Toaster

928
00:59:30,748 --> 00:59:38,410
Scott: or something We throw the Terminator into it to squish him Yeah, and you can just go over to it and throw your shit right over the edge and then watch it get crushed.

929
00:59:39,211 --> 00:59:41,148
Scott: But certain things you can't throw in there.

930
00:59:41,714 --> 00:59:49,890
Scott: so there's like for example They have a whole shipping container and the shipping container is where you put your computers and your TVs and all that kind of stuff.

931
00:59:50,030 --> 00:59:53,850
Scott: No, you can go in there and there's mad loot in there.

932
00:59:54,231 --> 00:59:59,709
Scott: We went in there and sure there was like a bunch of old compacts and monitors and CR mostly CRT's.

933
01:00:00,231 --> 01:00:09,061
Scott: But I found like a whole box full of like mad old 90s software and it was like I was like, oh shit CD roms is like there's.

934
01:00:09,141 --> 01:00:11,830
Scott: you can go there and get good shit if you just want.

935
01:00:12,314 --> 01:00:19,209
Rym: You know 90s computer shit You know, I think it might have changed because I remember think there were a bunch of charities like just growing up High fighter on CD roms.

936
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:25,536
Rym: I remember there are all these charities that would ostensibly take your computer stuff and then like yeah There is a place that does that.

937
01:00:25,577 --> 01:00:26,643
Scott: I have no idea where it is.

938
01:00:26,683 --> 01:00:27,790
Scott: I'm pretty sure it's not in New York.

939
01:00:27,870 --> 01:00:31,690
Scott: It's hard to find it's hard to get your shit, but they would then donate it to like schools and things.

940
01:00:32,032 --> 01:00:41,274
Rym: But I remember the result is that most of those got shut down Because they were basically scams where they would give schools garbage shit old broken computers at least one That wasn't a scam.

941
01:00:41,314 --> 01:00:52,210
Scott: and I remember because I watched the whole video about them and they were smart people like us who were Volunteering in their spare time like taking the good parts out of broken computers and come recombining them to make working computers.

942
01:00:52,551 --> 01:00:53,635
Rym: I think it's time for.

943
01:00:53,776 --> 01:01:04,770
Rym: and they were not selling them for a profit because because specifically we've hit this area For like six years now where computers aren't getting that much faster, and they're basically super durable and invincible.

944
01:01:04,951 --> 01:01:10,170
Scott: I think what's happening is everyone's getting rid of their computers replacing them with phones and tablets and not getting computers.

945
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:16,430
Scott: So now basically is can everyone but gamers and people have to do real work are getting rid of computers.

946
01:01:16,592 --> 01:01:20,096
Scott: And there's a bunch of free computers out there That could use homes.

947
01:01:20,337 --> 01:01:26,090
Rym: Yep, and I feel like you could put those in schools and do a lot of good Or you could put them in a giant supercomputer.

948
01:01:26,931 --> 01:01:28,717
Rym: Yeah, well you can make a bail of cluster.

949
01:01:28,737 --> 01:01:30,723
Scott: I don't think that's the 1996 called.

950
01:01:30,844 --> 01:01:32,369
Scott: It's called Hadoop.

951
01:01:32,429 --> 01:01:42,800

Rym: It is a it's quite a special book and I'm reading it to all of the patrons as an audiobook because that's just the kind of thing I'm doing pretty sure in this third chapter that I don't know if it was just a Sex scene from a fanfic and they changed the proper nouns.

963
01:03:29,594 --> 01:03:30,889
Rym: I don't know how this came to be.

964
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:43,280
Rym: Maybe the guy was trying to be funny and like push the edge or whatever, but pretty sure Timothy Bradley had an orgasm After touching Simon's whip like I don't know how else to read that.

973
01:04:10,891 --> 01:04:13,220
Rym: He reached out and grabbed the leather whip.

974
01:04:13,802 --> 01:04:15,810
Rym: it felt as though he'd grabbed a live wire.

975
01:04:16,311 --> 01:04:17,314
Rym: Yeah, he said.

976
01:04:17,334 --> 01:04:19,760
Rym: he felt his hair stand on end.

977
01:04:20,222 --> 01:04:22,548
Rym: energy coursed full throttle through his body.

978
01:04:22,568 --> 01:04:25,235
Rym: a burst Of light zapped through his eyes.

979
01:04:25,697 --> 01:04:30,350
Rym: then everything became a pleasant calm after the silent bang.

980
01:04:31,632 --> 01:04:33,461
Rym: You really shouldn't play around with shocks.

981
01:04:33,481 --> 01:04:35,170
Rym: He told Simon you can electrocute a guy.

982
01:04:35,471 --> 01:04:40,510
Rym: Yeah, this all takes place in a high school boys room, and I'm pretty sure it was describing an orgasm.

983
01:04:40,991 --> 01:04:44,060
Rym: But anyway now I leave you with something that tastes so good.

984

986
01:04:55,579 --> 01:04:59,250
Rym: I fly to the farthest galaxy for the cold refreshing taste of milk.

987
01:04:59,711 --> 01:05:03,061
Rym: I crawl through the burning wasteland for one satisfying.

988
01:05:03,121 --> 01:05:03,964
Rym: Yummy gulp of milk.

989
01:05:04,345 --> 01:05:06,070
Rym: I'd stretch myself to the limits.

990
01:05:06,853 --> 01:05:07,676
Rym: I do homework.

991
01:05:07,736 --> 01:05:09,783
