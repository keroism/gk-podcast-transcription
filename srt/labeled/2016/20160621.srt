00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,791
Rym: It's Tuesday, June 21st, 2016.

2
00:00:12,791 --> 00:00:13,252
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,272 --> 00:00:15,518
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:24,059
Rym: tonight we talk about people who may or may not know a lot about games and How bad they might be but all in good fun?

5
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,686
Rym: Thanks to Reddit.

6
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,019
Rym: I Don't know what the fuck to call this episode.

7
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,245
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:31,807 --> 00:00:34,800
Rym: So we like going to Wildwood like even though it's kind of in the bottom of New Jersey.

9
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,232
Rym: we have a long history of going to Wildwood and like friends and it's just.

10
00:00:38,292 --> 00:00:42,307
Rym: it's a. it's a very nostalgic place and For the East Coast of the US.

11
00:00:42,347 --> 00:00:45,600
Rym: It's one of the best beaches in terms of actual sand beach.

12
00:00:47,022 --> 00:00:49,570
Scott: You know, even in Florida is technically still the East Coast.

13
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,055
Rym: Yeah, the Northeast Coast.

14
00:00:51,817 --> 00:00:52,800
Scott: I mean, there's Virginia.

15
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,173
Scott: I guess it's below the Mason-Dixon line, but Virginia and a Virginia Beach.

16
00:00:56,494 --> 00:00:57,298
Scott: I've seen pictures of it.

17
00:00:57,318 --> 00:00:57,880
Rym: We've been to it.

18
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:59,511
Rym: It's usually crowded and kind of meh.

19
00:00:59,954 --> 00:01:00,920
Scott: Oh, it looked nice in the picture.

20
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:02,329
Rym: I mean a lot of things I never been.

21
00:01:02,389 --> 00:01:03,960
Rym: Rockaway looks real nice in the picture.

22
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:05,485
Scott: It is nice.

23
00:01:05,506 --> 00:01:08,381
Rym: Yeah, I wouldn't swim there that long Mmm.

24
00:01:08,722 --> 00:01:08,963
Rym: Yeah.

25
00:01:09,304 --> 00:01:12,032
Rym: So anyway, I do worse, but I tend to don't go.

26
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:17,752
Rym: it like I'll bike to Rockaway, but then I don't like Change into swimsuits and swim or like spend.

27
00:01:17,772 --> 00:01:19,439
Scott: it is where the fuck am I gonna put my bike?

28
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,532
Scott: Yeah, I'm in the water and then what I'm gonna bike back wet.

29
00:01:23,034 --> 00:01:24,120
Scott: Yeah, how is that gonna work?

30
00:01:24,601 --> 00:01:37,260
Rym: so Emily and I this Logistics are not there tipped off by Gothamis because apparently this seems like it's a relatively new thing and it's one of those things that Eventually like regular New Yorkers are gonna figure it out and ruin it for all of us.

31
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:48,413
Rym: But right now there's this express ferry that goes from 35th Street like that ferry terminal Yeah direct to Sandy Hook Beach Which I didn't actually even know existed.

32
00:01:48,433 --> 00:01:50,262
Scott: It's just a North Jersey Beach it's at that.

33
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:50,925
Rym: so it's be.

34
00:01:50,965 --> 00:02:00,140
Rym: it's north of North Jersey because there's Jersey kind of like goes up to that point and the Barrier Islands to the right and all the Jersey Shore places are in the barrier like islands the barrier peninsulas.

35
00:02:00,783 --> 00:02:11,260
Rym: But to get to this beach driving you have to go all the way around Into North Jersey and then turn left and go up north to actually get to it like it's popping up over the top.

36
00:02:11,905 --> 00:02:17,654
Rym: From the beach you can actually see Manhattan and like the Verrazano Narrows bridge and all that crap like it's it's.

37
00:02:17,734 --> 00:02:23,060
Rym: it's like kind of like off the coast of Staten Island And I just never really thought about that place and from New York.

38
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:31,746
Rym: It would be a super pain in the ass to get there Like it's actually harder to get there than to get to other beaches that are further south Unless you take a boat.

39
00:02:32,428 --> 00:02:35,598
Rym: So this boat is like 30 bucks round trip.

40
00:02:35,658 --> 00:02:41,140
Rym: That's a lot of monies Yeah But it's way less money than car or any other way to get to this beach.

41
00:02:41,381 --> 00:02:44,359
Rym: In fact, if you drive to the beach, it costs like 20 bucks just to park there.

42
00:02:45,301 --> 00:02:49,115
Rym: So the ferry takes like 40 minutes gets us right to the beach.

43
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:52,326
Rym: There's bike pads Everywhere up there.

44
00:02:52,386 --> 00:02:53,331
Rym: There's like no cars.

45
00:02:53,351 --> 00:02:54,215
Rym: You can bike everywhere.

46
00:02:54,255 --> 00:02:55,120
Rym: It's like great biking.

47
00:02:56,081 --> 00:02:58,272
Rym: There's like four beaches and they're great beaches.

48
00:02:58,634 --> 00:02:59,720
Rym: The water is super clean.

49
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:06,332
Rym: It's clearer and cleaner feeling than Wildwood's water Even though and apparently I was reading up about the beach.

50
00:03:06,593 --> 00:03:11,328
Rym: It's because of where it's situated It's sort of shielded from the New York stuff.

51
00:03:11,348 --> 00:03:15,920
Rym: So it's like very different water quality from all the other beaches in the New York area.

52
00:03:16,301 --> 00:03:19,172
Rym: it's more like swimming way further south would be normally.

53
00:03:20,055 --> 00:03:25,499
Rym: and the other interesting thing is There used to be a nuclear anti-aircraft battery on this island.

54
00:03:25,982 --> 00:03:30,944
Rym: So there's museums and like all this nuclear anti-aircraft show It's trying to shoot nukes.

55
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,211
Scott: theoretically would shoot nukes at planes.

56
00:03:33,312 --> 00:03:33,592
Rym: Yes.

57
00:03:33,733 --> 00:03:35,820
Scott: The idea was that is a bad idea.

58
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:40,440
Rym: So this is in the 50s and I knew a little bit about this, but I didn't know they couldn't hit the plane.

59
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,920
Scott: So they figure well just shoot a big enough aoe it is way worse than that.

60
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,713
Rym: So we had the Nike missiles right like Nike Ajax.

61
00:03:47,914 --> 00:03:49,160
Scott: Yeah, they weren't very good.

62
00:03:49,441 --> 00:03:49,823
Rym: Well, they were.

63
00:03:50,084 --> 00:03:53,619
Rym: so the original missile had a conventional explosive and it would shoot up.

64
00:03:54,061 --> 00:03:56,632
Rym: It was the first like missile rocket artillery.

65
00:03:56,873 --> 00:03:59,402
Rym: It would shoot up and hit a bomber Awesome.

66
00:03:59,803 --> 00:04:01,227
Scott: Yeah bombers big and easy to hit.

67
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:06,109
Rym: and they had this because they were worried about a Soviet nuclear bomber coming in to nuke New York.

68
00:04:06,436 --> 00:04:08,487
Scott: Yeah I mean that was a good plan.

69
00:04:08,547 --> 00:04:15,660
Rym: and then the Cold War progressed a little bit and instead of the worry being One Soviet bomber it was squadron of Soviet bombers.

70
00:04:16,202 --> 00:04:20,820
Rym: So the idea was why don't we just blow up a nuke over New York to blow up all the bombers?

71
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:22,547
Scott: Why don't you just use your fighters?

72
00:04:22,567 --> 00:04:24,114
Scott: you can shoot the bombers down.

73
00:04:24,134 --> 00:04:25,460
Scott: they're big and slow.

74
00:04:26,481 --> 00:04:28,480
Rym: There's reasons for that and our fighters are better.

75
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,432
Rym: I'm not gonna turn the front of the show into why it was the way it was.

76
00:04:31,814 --> 00:04:37,520
Rym: but I'll put it this way I thought we were looking at it cuz I didn't know a lot about like the Nike Ajax Nike Hercules.

77
00:04:37,681 --> 00:04:40,490
Rym: I knew a little bit just cuz that's like basic war history.

78
00:04:41,132 --> 00:04:41,894
Scott: So which?

79
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:43,500
Scott: which part of this is left at the beach?

80
00:04:44,103 --> 00:04:47,540
Rym: So the whole fucking thing like the batteries are there dishes nukes there waiting.

81
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:52,240
Rym: So obviously the nuke payload is not in them anymore the fuel is not in them anymore.

82
00:04:52,561 --> 00:04:53,084
Rym: but there's like.

83
00:04:53,145 --> 00:04:55,798
Rym: they've got him there as like museum pieces for you to check out.

84
00:04:55,818 --> 00:04:58,590
Scott: and They've got like whenever you go to the veterans place.

85
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,500
Scott: There's like a missile out in the front and it's empty.

86
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:01,563
Scott: It's a big metal.

87
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:02,747
Rym: Here's what's terrifying.

88
00:05:03,068 --> 00:05:09,111
Rym: They're really small two-stage missiles and looking at him I was like can't be that big a yield.

89
00:05:09,151 --> 00:05:10,177
Rym: I mean this would be used for air.

90
00:05:10,821 --> 00:05:11,223
Rym: It was like.

91
00:05:11,405 --> 00:05:12,169
Rym: what are these like?

92
00:05:12,552 --> 00:05:13,175
Rym: maybe like.

93
00:05:13,196 --> 00:05:13,920
Rym: are they a kiloton?

94
00:05:14,321 --> 00:05:16,226
Rym: No, these things are fucking like.

95
00:05:16,266 --> 00:05:18,572
Rym: I think it went up to 80 or 90 kilotons.

96
00:05:18,792 --> 00:05:20,477
Rym: We're talking nine Hiroshima's.

97
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:27,938
Rym: Yeah Yeah, the radar array is there and apparently on special days I got the schedule.

98
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:28,560
Rym: I want to go back.

99
00:05:28,901 --> 00:05:33,193
Rym: They do tours of the actual facility where all this shit is now.

100
00:05:33,213 --> 00:05:33,814
Rym: They'd only do it.

101
00:05:34,236 --> 00:05:35,760
Scott: They do it like pike your bike.

102
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,168
Rym: Yeah, I probably parked our bike outside everywhere.

103
00:05:38,188 --> 00:05:41,600
Rym: There was totally safe now granted, but there was safety in numbers one.

104
00:05:41,761 --> 00:05:43,306
Rym: Everyone bikes everywhere on this island.

105
00:05:43,326 --> 00:05:44,490
Rym: There's bike racks everywhere.

106
00:05:45,233 --> 00:05:47,200
Rym: You can't get cars near the bike racks.

107
00:05:47,782 --> 00:05:51,859
Rym: So so like the kinds of bike theory they're going to Manhattan can't really happen there.

108
00:05:53,363 --> 00:05:56,120
Rym: New York riffraff can't easily get there because the expensive ferry.

109
00:05:56,601 --> 00:06:04,282
Rym: New Jersey riffraff can't easily get there because it's a long drive and you have to pay a lot of money to park there or bike in Bike.

110
00:06:04,302 --> 00:06:05,686
Rym: that every seems a pretty uncommon.

111
00:06:05,726 --> 00:06:07,692
Rym: there like most people weren't even locking their bikes up.

112
00:06:08,054 --> 00:06:09,920
Rym: But no we fucking locked our bikes up.

113
00:06:11,022 --> 00:06:14,013
Rym: No one stole them though, but partly because we both have beefy locks.

114
00:06:14,354 --> 00:06:17,406
Rym: so we locked our bikes together Mutually to the pole.

115
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:20,500
Rym: So if the three of us went daddy three locks.

116
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:28,380
Rym: But yeah, so there's all these batteries there like old batteries from like early World War one and late Civil War.

117
00:06:28,782 --> 00:06:32,080
Rym: There's so much cool history on the island and great beaches.

118
00:06:32,987 --> 00:06:34,158
Rym: One of the beaches is special.

119
00:06:35,163 --> 00:06:44,100
Rym: There's like a bunch of beaches at different places along the island but one of the beaches is Technically owned by the federal government and is not New Jersey state land.

120
00:06:44,942 --> 00:06:47,330
Rym: So you can have alcohol on the beach.

121
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:52,848
Rym: There are basically no rules except federal rules on the beach and You can be naked on the beach.

122
00:06:52,908 --> 00:06:55,220
Scott: So it's the new for tilden is the same way then.

123
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:04,460
Rym: Yeah but unlike this beach has a like all these beaches here also have a lot of Facilities and way better showers and changing rooms and things than a lot of beaches.

124
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,526
Rym: So it was just a great place.

125
00:07:06,587 --> 00:07:11,276
Rym: I'm gonna go there a bunch of times, but not immediately cuz Kind of got a little bit sunburned.

126
00:07:12,442 --> 00:07:13,360
Scott: Why did you bring lotions?

127
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:14,342
Rym: I went.

128
00:07:14,362 --> 00:07:18,880
Rym: I did a lot of swim in and I rubbed it off and didn't correctly fully reapply.

129
00:07:19,301 --> 00:07:22,129
Rym: So my sides where I like my arms rubbed it off.

130
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:26,080
Rym: Yeah, it's bad news bears another problem with swimming mid bike.

131
00:07:26,703 --> 00:07:29,260
Rym: Yeah, the thing is what we did is we biked around for like a few hours.

132
00:07:29,561 --> 00:07:29,963
Rym: Then we went.

133
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:31,650
Scott: it's also a problem with the nude beach.

134
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:34,100
Scott: right suddenly you got a lotion in all the places.

135
00:07:34,545 --> 00:07:42,960
Rym: Honestly, if I'm in a nude beach I'm not gonna be super nude cuz I am NOT going to ever risk burning the young master and his merry man.

136
00:07:43,428 --> 00:07:44,482
Rym: Holy shit Is that?

137
00:07:44,542 --> 00:07:46,872
Rym: literally one of my biggest fears is a sunburn down.

138
00:07:47,073 --> 00:07:48,619
Scott: all peeling off can't use it.

139
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,559
Scott: Okay, when every time you pee you got to touch it.

140
00:07:51,640 --> 00:08:04,050
Rym: Yeah, especially because this we would not have been nearly so bad when I was the younger man Cuz I used to wear boxes all the time, but son as you get older, it's box of briefs time and Box of briefs plus the sunburn down there.

141
00:08:04,071 --> 00:08:05,900
Rym: I feel like I just would call in sick.

142
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,930
Scott: I mean even just sun burning your ass is not good.

143
00:08:08,151 --> 00:08:08,794
Scott: You sit down.

144
00:08:09,276 --> 00:08:09,417
Scott: Ow.

145
00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:19,020
Scott: Yeah It doesn't matter what you wear and I think I'd wear unless unless you're wearing like a freeze ice pack like a mushy gel one.

146
00:08:21,442 --> 00:08:27,160
Rym: But yeah, I plan to go to this beach on a semi-regular imagine like rubbing cool aloe like all over your butt.

147
00:08:27,408 --> 00:08:33,715
Rym: Yeah So I was just cool and you should check it out and I'm gonna find out when I can go see.

148
00:08:33,735 --> 00:08:42,760
Rym: because apparently like I suspect There are still some sort of like anti-aircraft things there because there's a lot of military personnel who work there still.

149
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:48,360
Rym: So the tours of the nuclear shit are like tightly controlled on certain specific days gonna shoot somebody.

150
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,547
Rym: Also, the park service is like all over this place.

151
00:08:51,587 --> 00:08:56,199
Rym: So like there's all these old gigantic gun batteries and abandoned forts and everything.

152
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,186
Rym: and There's park services.

153
00:08:58,206 --> 00:09:03,220
Rym: people just stand in there and if you bike up They're like, hey you want to come inside and like check this shit out.

154
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:09,560
Rym: They give you a flashlight and a hardhat and they're like Let's go and they just tell you all the history and answer any questions and they're all a hundred percent chill.

155
00:09:12,101 --> 00:09:17,828
Rym: That's what their job is is stand there and all day every day what I do in the winter In the winter, you can still go to this island.

156
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:18,692
Rym: There's a bunch of stuff there.

157
00:09:19,536 --> 00:09:20,460
Scott: It's a pretty weird job.

158
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,692
Rym: Yeah, Park Service is kind of awesome.

159
00:09:22,732 --> 00:09:23,598
Rym: I wish we had more of that.

160
00:09:25,141 --> 00:09:26,184
Rym: So, yeah, that was my weekend.

161
00:09:26,204 --> 00:09:28,671
Scott: hmm, I just biked to normal places.

162
00:09:28,832 --> 00:09:31,520
Scott: now don't have to spend money in our in, New Jersey.

163
00:09:33,061 --> 00:09:34,789
Rym: Well, I was on federal land for a part of it.

164
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:37,099
Scott: Yeah, I didn't go to the federal lands this weekend.

165
00:09:38,601 --> 00:09:45,406
Rym: So, uh in the actual news you got any news cuz it's gaming day and such Fiasco people are talking about here right?

166
00:09:45,566 --> 00:09:46,288
Rym: Oh a fiasco.

167
00:09:46,308 --> 00:09:47,632
Scott: No sort of a fiasco.

168
00:09:47,752 --> 00:09:48,735
Rym: the game fiasco.

169
00:09:49,517 --> 00:09:50,359
Scott: So basic now.

170
00:09:51,921 --> 00:09:54,931
Scott: So there was basically there's this company tiny bill.

171
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:55,915
Scott: is it called tiny build?

172
00:09:56,115 --> 00:09:57,099
Scott: it's called something like that.

173
00:09:58,563 --> 00:09:58,987
Scott: What happened?

174
00:09:59,007 --> 00:09:59,834
Scott: I lost the link.

175
00:10:00,197 --> 00:10:02,887
Rym: Oh Radio silence gig judges off the air.

176
00:10:02,907 --> 00:10:09,646
Rym: I'm gonna fill it with patter until Scott comes back online with this link on his iPad I guess And I'm running out of steam.

177
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,393
Rym: So I'm playing a lot of overwatch.

178
00:10:11,634 --> 00:10:12,840
Rym: I can start talking about overwatch.

179
00:10:13,422 --> 00:10:18,260
Rym: I figured out how to deal with the situation where you're pushing and it's over time.

180
00:10:18,782 --> 00:10:21,734
Scott: They took a link off the top of the page so I had to like scroll down to find it.

181
00:10:21,874 --> 00:10:26,129
Scott: that is a tiny build Which made some games like speedrunners and games.

182
00:10:26,149 --> 00:10:28,256
Scott: I never heard of whatever they.

183
00:10:28,477 --> 00:10:32,259
Scott: basically here's what happened They set up a website to sell their game.

184
00:10:32,661 --> 00:10:34,308
Scott: So you go to their website tiny build.

185
00:10:34,609 --> 00:10:37,160
Scott: you buy the game and they give you a steam code.

186
00:10:37,582 --> 00:10:39,229
Scott: Then you use the steam code and you have the game.

187
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:41,931
Scott: this way instead of buying the game on steam you buy the game from them.

188
00:10:42,821 --> 00:10:44,931
Rym: Right, yep real common sure whatever.

189
00:10:45,615 --> 00:10:50,269
Scott: so there's this other website G2a which is apparently the shadiest of shady fucks.

190
00:10:50,289 --> 00:10:53,720
Scott: and what g2a does is basically let you resell game codes.

191
00:10:54,481 --> 00:10:58,519
Scott: So you would buy a game code or maybe you have a game that you don't want or already.

192
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:04,620
Rym: That's the kind of thing that if I didn't know what I like what I know about the game industry I'd be thinking that sounds like a pretty cool side.

193
00:11:04,861 --> 00:11:07,512
Scott: I mean in principle that's perfectly okay, right.

194
00:11:07,532 --> 00:11:14,613
Scott: if I buy a humble bundle and there's a game I already got and I don't want to gift the game to anyone or whatever Why shouldn't I be able to sell that code right?

195
00:11:14,794 --> 00:11:18,819
Scott: It's a writer for a sale And you know in that aspect g2a is fine, right?

196
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:26,071
Scott: So you go on g2a you put your code someone else buys it from you they get the code They use it on steam what and they get the big at the game, right?

197
00:11:26,332 --> 00:11:28,400
Scott: It's that's nothing wrong with that in principle.

198
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:38,887
Scott: apparently though g2a is like shady as fuck and they really don't give a crap if like people are selling bullshit codes or Whatever.

199
00:11:38,947 --> 00:11:55,740
Scott: so the scam is this people go out and they look for People selling game codes that have shitty web stores like tiny bills own personal store And they use fraudulent stolen credit cards to buy codes.

200
00:11:56,442 --> 00:12:00,960
Scott: They resell the codes on g2a to basically money launder them and get tournaments like real money.

201
00:12:01,744 --> 00:12:04,760
Scott: Then obviously the transaction gets cancelled.

202
00:12:05,262 --> 00:12:09,997
Scott: So now the person with the original store has given away the game the code.

203
00:12:10,037 --> 00:12:14,539
Scott: that's gonna work But now they don't get any money because it was a fraudulent credit card.

204
00:12:15,162 --> 00:12:23,199
Scott: But meanwhile now it's the person who used the stolen credit card has the money because they resold the code I like a good price or even you know discount or whatever.

205
00:12:23,902 --> 00:12:28,320
Scott: So the game got given to some legitimate gamer who bought the code who wants to play it.

206
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:38,171
Scott: So sometimes I think in certain cases what they've done is they've like, you know invalidated those codes And now someone paid money to a scammer and now doesn't even have a game.

207
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:38,713
Scott: Yep.

208
00:12:38,793 --> 00:12:39,295
Rym: Now granted.

209
00:12:39,335 --> 00:12:40,840
Scott: I see ever still has the money.

210
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,245
Rym: Yeah, okay.

211
00:12:42,546 --> 00:12:55,210
Scott: So the two I think that you know, everyone here is blaming g2a which yeah You should blame g2a because basically it appears they don't give a fuck about shit like this and they're like Okay, they're just so scammy and don't give a crap.

212
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:58,020
Scott: and they're like, hooray we're making so much money from these scammers.

213
00:12:58,201 --> 00:13:00,392
Scott: Please continue selling shady shit.

214
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:04,899
Scott: Yeah, but also Some blame needs to be put on.

215
00:13:05,463 --> 00:13:07,840
Scott: You know, I guess there it's sort of victim blaming.

216
00:13:07,961 --> 00:13:10,300
Scott: It's sort of like oh you didn't lock your door and your house got robbed.

217
00:13:10,661 --> 00:13:15,480
Scott: But at the same time you're really dumb if you don't even lock your door to your house and you have valuable shit in there.

218
00:13:15,701 --> 00:13:17,940
Scott: Yeah, don't make your own fucking web store.

219
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:21,756
Scott: It's like everyone complains that like Apple or steam or whoever is taking a cut.

220
00:13:22,118 --> 00:13:28,100
Rym: dude guys We tried to Scott and I like we were gonna do some e-commerce way back and I started setting them a magento server.

221
00:13:28,362 --> 00:13:31,100
Rym: Yeah, fuck that never you pay someone else.

222
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:33,652
Scott: Someone else is taking a cut.

223
00:13:33,672 --> 00:13:37,247
Scott: So they set up their own web store and Yeah, cuz you know what.

224
00:13:37,307 --> 00:13:39,956
Scott: now they're like, I think they said they were so upset.

225
00:13:39,996 --> 00:13:44,890
Scott: It's like we've spent more time developing Anti credit card fraud than developing games.

226
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,456
Scott: It's like why are you developing that?

227
00:13:46,496 --> 00:13:47,460
Scott: you could have just bought it?

228
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:54,900
Scott: Yeah, or instead of bonding it you could have just paid someone else like Apple the cut they take which is going towards things like this.

229
00:13:55,802 --> 00:13:56,732
Rym: That's you know Cuz I've.

230
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:56,939
Rym: you know.

231
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:03,180
Rym: I work on Wall Street like in my day job and one of the primary like arguments and discussions that always happens is build versus buy.

232
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,545
Rym: Do you build something or buy it?

233
00:14:04,806 --> 00:14:08,360
Rym: The answer is almost never to build it unless it's your primary thing.

234
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:12,015
Rym: Yeah, so there right unless it's the thing making you money just buy someone else's right.

235
00:14:12,076 --> 00:14:16,072
Scott: and it was even like I think like one or two weeks ago, John Oliver did a thing about.

236
00:14:16,092 --> 00:14:18,200
Scott: do you let people know about you know?

237
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:25,010
Scott: Something we knew already which is like hey, yeah mutual funds and have mad fees on them Right, but it's like he wasn't.

238
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,214
Scott: even he wasn't like.

239
00:14:26,395 --> 00:14:27,700
Scott: yeah find one with no fees.

240
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:35,207
Scott: It's like no because your fee is still buying you something which is a smart person buying stuff You don't have to right it's not?

241
00:14:35,227 --> 00:14:38,440
Rym: you don't watch out for robo advisors because that's kind of making that less and less.

242
00:14:38,663 --> 00:14:39,379
Scott: But yeah, no.

243
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,864
Scott: But the point is is right is it?

244
00:14:41,105 --> 00:14:56,603
Scott: if you want to do something without having to work this fees to cover shit like this Yep, right, so kind of like if you're a tiny build and you lose apparently they say they've lost $450,000 right Because of this.

245
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:57,065
Scott: it's like.

246
00:14:57,085 --> 00:15:01,240
Scott: that's what you get for opening up your own goddamn store and doing something that isn't your own deal.

247
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:07,400
Scott: You should have just sold your stuff on Amazon and Google and Apple and let them take the cut and steam whatever.

248
00:15:07,581 --> 00:15:10,229
Rym: Yeah, I mean the primary blame still falls on the scammers.

249
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:12,055
Scott: Obviously if G that's the other thing.

250
00:15:12,095 --> 00:15:27,542
Scott: if g2a didn't exist Right and wasn't doing this or it wasn't being shady there would be even if you bought these codes of stolen credit cards You'd have no way to turn those code to launder those codes into money and there would be no point in buying codes of stolen credit

251
00:15:27,582 --> 00:15:27,843
Rym: card.

252
00:15:27,883 --> 00:15:36,391
Rym: companies also are a little culpable because they have a lot of capacity to Recognize trends of fraudulent use and deal with that.

253
00:15:36,471 --> 00:15:38,898
Scott: they do do some extent but they don't do it.

254
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:39,700
Scott: It's it's weird.

255
00:15:39,781 --> 00:15:44,660
Scott: It's like if I use my card at like a store I never go to it won't work and I'll get a phone call.

256
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:51,459
Scott: Yeah, but if some legit stolen credit cards are used to buy game codes like a thousand times at the same store They don't do anything.

257
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:54,160
Scott: It's like I don't know what their anti-fraud system is.

258
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:59,664
Rym: But so actually my credit card number got stolen a bunch of times in rapid succession due to a breach I think with a bank or whatever.

259
00:15:59,704 --> 00:16:16,493
Rym: like there's a credit card processing or there's some sort of big like super top-level breaches years ago and every time it got stolen and used for until like finally just stopped because The big high up person had fixed it It was always at the same Target store in like.

260
00:16:16,573 --> 00:16:17,135
Rym: Tennessee.

261
00:16:17,256 --> 00:16:18,520
Scott: wasn't target the place they had a breach.

262
00:16:19,285 --> 00:16:21,380
Rym: I might have been but I haven't shopped at the target like ever.

263
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,044
Rym: Yeah So it wasn't.

264
00:16:23,204 --> 00:16:25,892
Rym: it was my credit card number was not breached because of Target.

265
00:16:26,133 --> 00:16:31,219
Rym: just Target was the store where people were using the fraudulent Credit cards that they cloned or whatever to make purchases.

266
00:16:32,363 --> 00:16:33,230
Scott: But yeah, it's really.

267
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:44,097
Scott: it's also the law's fault Right because if I was the government I would just say credit card companies as in Visa MasterCard American Express You're responsible for all of the costs associated with not merchants not customers.

268
00:16:44,138 --> 00:16:44,680
Scott: Not anyone else.

269
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,588
Scott: It's gonna be you no matter what and you what they would.

270
00:16:46,668 --> 00:16:52,051
Rym: I would say then you can't use credit cards online at all Unless you have a chip reader in your house plugged into your computer.

271
00:16:52,433 --> 00:16:55,390
Scott: and then I would say no You just have to fucking deal with it.

272
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:55,672
Scott: visa.

273
00:16:55,713 --> 00:16:58,365
Scott: Fuck you because That's the law we passed.

274
00:16:58,405 --> 00:17:01,155
Rym: This is why you're not president nor you're a member of Congress.

275
00:17:01,216 --> 00:17:02,260
Scott: Why not deal with it?

276
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:07,236
Scott: Okay, you have your multi bajillion dollar international company like visa.

277
00:17:07,577 --> 00:17:08,400
Scott: fucking deal with it.

278
00:17:08,601 --> 00:17:10,309
Scott: If this loss is involved you eat him.

279
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:10,992
Scott: Fuck you.

280
00:17:11,012 --> 00:17:12,660
Scott: Yeah, I can have plenty of fuck.

281
00:17:12,901 --> 00:17:13,864
Rym: I'm gonna go that route.

282
00:17:13,884 --> 00:17:14,928
Rym: There's a better way.

283
00:17:15,008 --> 00:17:15,891
Scott: What's the better way?

284
00:17:15,931 --> 00:17:18,619
Rym: You just fucking nationalize the credit card.

285
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,867
Scott: That's a great idea too.

286
00:17:20,008 --> 00:17:21,255
Rym: You don't tell the private company.

287
00:17:21,295 --> 00:17:22,160
Rym: Fuck you do what we want.

288
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,760
Rym: You say you're a public company now, that'd be fine, too.

289
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:27,493
Rym: I owned by the public as in the federal government.

290
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:28,560
Scott: that actually sounds great, too.

291
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:32,111
Scott: I'd be like, hey guess what Visa MasterCard and American Express relating all of you.

292
00:17:32,131 --> 00:17:35,020
Scott: There's not one thing it's called US card system.

293
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:39,875
Rym: Yeah, listeners guys realize like we're pretty radically far left on a lot of issues.

294
00:17:39,915 --> 00:17:40,718
Scott: I'm okay with that.

295
00:17:40,758 --> 00:17:44,029
Rym: It sounds great But there's also like the.

296
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,900
Scott: there's a little bit and you know what?

297
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,190
Scott: You could also get rid of all those stupid things that you know, like you get your ATM card And there's all those weird symbols in the back.

298
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,899
Scott: Yeah, it's like rich ATM.

299
00:17:53,121 --> 00:17:55,560
Scott: Can I you can get rid of all those two and join them in the same system?

300
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:06,519
Rym: So a little bit of blame goes on the people who buy stuff on g2a Because when you see a game for sale for like a penny or a dollar somewhere That's there's almost no way that's legit.

301
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:12,400
Scott: Yeah, sure, but you know also like I at least that person's a legit gamer.

302
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,131
Scott: They're probably a poor high school kid with no money.

303
00:18:14,172 --> 00:18:15,400
Scott: Who's the only way they can get a game?

304
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,450
Rym: I looked at you to his website for the first time.

305
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:19,339
Rym: Yeah, I would have assumed it was a scam.

306
00:18:20,129 --> 00:18:22,485
Scott: Yeah, that's the site I'm never gonna give like dude.

307
00:18:22,525 --> 00:18:26,077
Rym: at the top it has a little money bag sign and it says g2a gold mine.

308
00:18:26,158 --> 00:18:27,288
Rym: earn real money with us.

309
00:18:27,553 --> 00:18:32,618
Rym: no Oh The site sets off all my fishing radar, yeah.

310
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,443
Rym: So g2a.

311
00:18:34,463 --> 00:18:38,340
Scott: yeah, if you want to buy a game just but it's like dude the steam sale isn't cheap enough for you.

312
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:44,280
Rym: Yeah, how to go to cheetah you're bitching about paying, you know, five dollars instead of a dollar on a shady side.

313
00:18:44,643 --> 00:18:45,470
Rym: Come on, guys.

314
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:49,860
Rym: I Mean, I bought overwatch like immediately a full price, but that game's not gonna get cheaper.

315
00:18:50,423 --> 00:18:51,709
Scott: Yeah, I think there's also.

316
00:18:51,729 --> 00:18:54,060
Scott: I think part of it is that with g2a you can you know?

317
00:18:54,261 --> 00:18:57,960
Scott: If you don't have a credit card or some punk kid you can earn money doing g2a nonsense.

318
00:18:58,181 --> 00:19:05,825
Rym: Yeah, and by games with you know, that's that's exactly I was about to get to that because that is the game store model as Well, I trade in your games.

319
00:19:06,066 --> 00:19:17,460
Rym: Yeah, I feel like that business model of target kids You can't get credit cards should not be allowed and simultaneously There should be an easier way to give kids credit cards that their parents control.

320
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:25,989
Scott: You should be able to go into any bank Even if you're gonna give them cash and they should have to give you a card That is worth that amount of cash that can be.

321
00:19:26,009 --> 00:19:29,040
Rym: well you can do that like any target or Rite Aid or whatever.

322
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:30,325
Scott: Yeah, you get a gift card.

323
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:33,298
Rym: No, you can buy like visa debit cards or whatever.

324
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:34,946
Scott: Yeah, sure But sometimes those don't work.

325
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:40,560
Rym: No, I'm saying like when I was a young kid, like I was a teenager I was like lucky because you know, my parents were internet and I was internet.

326
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:45,340
Rym: So they got me a credit card when I was really young that they were also on the account.

327
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:48,755
Rym: So even as a punk kid, I could use a credit card to do stuff online.

328
00:19:49,097 --> 00:19:52,780
Rym: in the modern era It is ridiculous that 13 year olds can't have credit cards.

329
00:19:53,121 --> 00:19:57,156
Rym: I mean I when I was 13 year old needs a credit card like they need a smartphone.

330
00:19:57,216 --> 00:20:02,315
Scott: when I was in high school I bought stuff by buying it online and then mailing a check to the place.

331
00:20:02,616 --> 00:20:04,978
Scott: Wow that worked It's real well.

332
00:20:05,542 --> 00:20:12,145
Scott: And then when I was in college Rym was like I. the reason I didn't get a credit card was simply because I figured I Didn't have any credit.

333
00:20:12,185 --> 00:20:14,380
Scott: They wouldn't send me one and Rym was like they'll totally send you one.

334
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:18,060
Scott: So I went to a website and he filled out the form and sure enough a credit card came in the mail.

335
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,171
Scott: I'm like, oh, okay.

336
00:20:19,454 --> 00:20:32,460
Rym: We're good But like in the modern era it's ridiculous to expect a 12 year old to not have a cell phone And it's ridiculous to expect the 12 year old shouldn't have cards They can use to interact with the modern world of currency and commercial transactions.

337
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:36,280
Rym: So in other news, this is sort of an interesting thing.

338
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,749
Rym: So overwatch is getting you know patches and updates and everything.

339
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:52,760
Rym: but Jeff Kaplan who is the game director Actually posted a very long sort of discussion of The changes they're making and the rationale and basically everything around the matchmaking in overwatch and the matchmaking.

340
00:20:52,820 --> 00:21:03,300
Rym: those are guys like the most advanced matchmaking on earth that they do and Overwatch is in the he even admitted is basically a special problem even more so than other games of its ilk.

341
00:21:04,743 --> 00:21:06,114
Scott: Isn't it the same problem as tf2 or?

342
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:11,920
Rym: Tf2 didn't have that much of a skill cap and the characters weren't actually that much different?

343
00:21:12,248 --> 00:21:12,700
Scott: I guess yeah.

344
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:18,620
Scott: If there's less skill then it doesn't matter as much who you're paired with because you can you'll you have much more leeway.

345
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:26,420
Scott: It's like if you miss pair people it won't make it won't ruin the game as much Whereas if you miss pair and a high skill cap game, right that one person is gonna kill everybody.

346
00:21:26,527 --> 00:21:27,744
Rym: also the matches are very different.

347
00:21:27,764 --> 00:21:34,831
Rym: like the matches function more like a sports game in terms of how they're structured than a Server of capture the flag or whatever like it.

348
00:21:35,534 --> 00:21:39,539
Rym: I'm doing a review in the game So I'll kind of sidestep just explaining what I mean by all that.

349
00:21:40,061 --> 00:21:56,380
Rym: But also because of the grouping like it's six on six and you can pick from all these different characters and the characters are So radically different and you can change characters mid-match And you're expected to like I'll run while like I'll run diva for half the match.

350
00:21:56,641 --> 00:22:00,839
Rym: But then during a clutch moment I switch to Winston and they go back to diva like people do stuff like that.

351
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:09,798
Rym: So the matchmaking is crazy complicated, but the two really interesting things that you should just read this thing I'm not gonna paraphrase it all for you is one.

352
00:22:10,861 --> 00:22:17,300
Rym: He said that if they broadly describe how it works they can summarize match results into five broad buckets.

353
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:18,927
Rym: My team won.

354
00:22:19,249 --> 00:22:22,803
Rym: we beat the other team by a long shot To.

355
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,107
Rym: my team barely won.

356
00:22:24,688 --> 00:22:26,072
Rym: My team barely lost.

357
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:28,900
Rym: my team lost and it wasn't even close.

358
00:22:29,502 --> 00:22:33,035
Rym: And then the last category is this match was somehow fucked up or broken.

359
00:22:33,436 --> 00:22:34,460
Scott: so I dropped out.

360
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,551
Rym: Yeah, like people dropped out.

361
00:22:35,592 --> 00:22:36,400
Rym: It didn't have the max number.

362
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,940
Rym: Play the game like maybe the mat like the ping half of rocket league games.

363
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:50,440
Rym: But what's interesting is that if you ask the average gamer like what kind of game do you want to play?

364
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,440
Rym: They would say that the games they want the most are the two middle ones.

365
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,632
Rym: My team barely won or my team barely lost.

366
00:22:56,673 --> 00:22:57,920
Scott: like that's bullshit the clothes fair.

367
00:22:58,142 --> 00:22:58,811
Scott: I want to win.

368
00:22:59,196 --> 00:22:59,560
Rym: quotes.

369
00:23:00,042 --> 00:23:04,196
Rym: Most players will say they want a match to be either type 2 or type 3 as I described above.

370
00:23:04,256 --> 00:23:05,919
Rym: those sound even barely win Or barely lose.

371
00:23:06,341 --> 00:23:11,840
Rym: But I believe when psychology comes into play most players actually expect type 1 or type 2 to be the result.

372
00:23:12,482 --> 00:23:18,140
Rym: Even amazingly a close type 3 the my team barely lost is generally is can turn into a quote.

373
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:21,350
Rym: Highly negative experience for a lot of players.

374
00:23:21,611 --> 00:23:27,480
Scott: right people who don't have most gamers on earth Right do not have the competitive mindset.

375
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:35,066
Scott: They do not actually want to measure their skills against the skills of another person and have the result Declare one person more skilled.

376
00:23:35,286 --> 00:23:38,295
Scott: that makes them upset especially if they lose.

377
00:23:38,837 --> 00:23:39,820
Scott: if they win they don't care.

378
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:46,606
Rym: But if they lose it makes them very upset because they in that because they don't just want to win and have a closed game They prefer to win soundly.

379
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:59,284
Scott: to be like this is why games like pandemic and munchkin and all these things are very very popular Especially compared to game, you know, I'm the only people who play games like counter-strike or dota are like, you know hardcore time This is inside.

380
00:23:59,344 --> 00:23:59,625
Rym: I don't know.

381
00:23:59,645 --> 00:24:01,714
Rym: I I heard there's a munchkin CCG like.

382
00:24:01,754 --> 00:24:02,257
Rym: I ignored it.

383
00:24:02,317 --> 00:24:02,859
Rym: like I don't know.

384
00:24:03,221 --> 00:24:04,447
Scott: Yep, I watched a video of that.

385
00:24:04,547 --> 00:24:08,106
Rym: Okay, so if I were going to make that game I don't know what the real game is.

386
00:24:08,147 --> 00:24:09,153
Rym: I've literally not looked at it.

387
00:24:09,576 --> 00:24:10,119
Rym: I would make it.

388
00:24:10,441 --> 00:24:20,680
Rym: I'll just keep selling cards forever and there's basically almost no rules of what you can put in your deck and Just the nerd who brings the most fucked up deck will win in any given group.

389
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:24,583
Rym: It's just like this ARG game almost No, whatever.

390
00:24:24,603 --> 00:24:25,267
Rym: That's what I would do.

391
00:24:25,668 --> 00:24:26,693
Rym: Just give.

392
00:24:26,713 --> 00:24:28,120
Scott: it seems like they made a real game.

393
00:24:28,582 --> 00:24:30,070
Scott: I see that's the problem, but it also.

394
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:35,013
Scott: but it includes silliness of munchkin For example dropping a card and seeing where it lands.

395
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:35,636
Rym: Yes.

396
00:24:35,656 --> 00:24:36,520
Rym: Yeah, I would go crazy.

397
00:24:36,621 --> 00:24:40,300
Rym: I'd have cards that be like if you're at a penny arcade Expo.

398
00:24:40,501 --> 00:24:43,353
Rym: This monster is worth plus ten levels or whatever.

399
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:44,920
Rym: Like I would go nuts.

400
00:24:45,741 --> 00:24:49,136
Rym: I would make the game less of a game because that I'd make it more like we didn't play.

401
00:24:49,156 --> 00:24:49,819
Rym: test this at all.

402
00:24:50,643 --> 00:24:51,487
Rym: But I digress.

403
00:24:51,989 --> 00:24:57,533
Rym: so he talks about that a lot like the matchmaking and how players Will say they want even matches, but really they just want to win.

404
00:24:57,573 --> 00:24:59,160
Rym: but something really fascinating happened.

405
00:24:59,481 --> 00:25:09,508
Rym: There's a feature that I've used that I really liked and it's interesting that I did not anticipate the problem with this feature and Blizzard apparently did not anticipate the problem either.

406
00:25:09,529 --> 00:25:12,740
Rym: They're removing the feature now because of this problem.

407
00:25:13,464 --> 00:25:16,240
Rym: I mean smart people might have come up with it if they really thought about it.

408
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:30,240
Rym: But the idea is in this matchmaking system, you know, this is a game you play in public So you can block other people from like your chats or whatever and you can report people for being shitty and Blizzard takes all that Super seriously, but you also have the option to avoid a player.

409
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:43,418
Rym: So if someone's a bitch like there's annoying little shit bird or you know whatever causes them to be annoying or not fun to have on your team or play with you can say avoid this player and It'll take that into account whenever it's matchmaking you.

410
00:25:44,661 --> 00:25:50,800
Rym: What actually happened is that most people would click avoid on anyone who ever beat them.

411
00:25:51,503 --> 00:25:54,137
Rym: they never wanted to play against people who were better than them of course,

412
00:25:54,197 --> 00:25:54,378
Scott: right and

413
00:25:55,901 --> 00:26:05,400
Rym: That started being a huge problem because basically good players could never find games and apparently the way they figured it out Was that one of the best players in the country like in the world?

414
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:09,095
Scott: He plays Widowmaker the sniper and he's the one that requires the most skill.

415
00:26:09,417 --> 00:26:15,220
Rym: Yes this play Oh Widowmaker might be number two in terms of skill But anyway, this person I don't know if it's guy or girl.

416
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:21,333
Rym: I didn't fully read this but basically they were complaining that they could never get matched up Like they'd never find games.

417
00:26:21,373 --> 00:26:22,039
Rym: it would take forever.

418
00:26:23,102 --> 00:26:26,140
Rym: Let me see if I can find the actual quote because it was real interesting.

419
00:26:27,521 --> 00:26:29,368
Scott: Even other really skilled people didn't want to play.

420
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:31,315
Rym: Well, you've got to find a match.

421
00:26:31,355 --> 00:26:31,877
Rym: They could be it.

422
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:32,399
Rym: Here it is.

423
00:26:35,108 --> 00:26:35,879
Rym: Read this whole thing.

424
00:26:36,282 --> 00:26:37,307
Rym: We realized the avoid.

425
00:26:37,347 --> 00:26:39,237
Rym: this player was wreaking havoc on matchmaking.

426
00:26:40,383 --> 00:26:48,397
Rym: One of the best Widowmaker players in the world complained to us about long queue times We looked into it and found that hundreds of other players had avoided him quote.

427
00:26:48,577 --> 00:26:49,220
Rym: He's a nice guy.

428
00:26:50,061 --> 00:26:54,920
Rym: They avoided him because they did not want to play it against him because he's good not because of any misbehavior, right?

429
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,746
Scott: You don't play basketball against Michael Jordan.

430
00:26:57,207 --> 00:26:59,474
Rym: Well, I do because that would be a fascinating you're not?

431
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:06,080
Rym: it's like see part of it Is like like I want to lose to ridiculous people just because that's what hell of an experience.

432
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,525
Scott: Well, yeah, so here's the problem.

433
00:27:07,565 --> 00:27:09,693
Scott: right depending it depends a lot on the game right?

434
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:15,812
Scott: if I play basketball against Michael Jordan It's not fun because the skill difference is so big.

435
00:27:16,213 --> 00:27:17,256
Scott: even old Michael Jordan.

436
00:27:17,377 --> 00:27:21,854
Scott: today Michael Jordan the skill Oh, yeah, still so big I would never touch the ball.

437
00:27:21,914 --> 00:27:23,360
Scott: I would never do anything meaningful.

438
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,226
Scott: I would net right and it would.

439
00:27:25,326 --> 00:27:26,790
Scott: so it's like I'm not even playing basketball.

440
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:29,920
Scott: I'm literally just standing there maybe running around ineffectively.

441
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:31,525
Scott: I'm not even playing the game.

442
00:27:31,545 --> 00:27:31,766
Scott: It's not.

443
00:27:31,826 --> 00:27:35,800
Scott: even if I'm not upset by losing I don't get to do anything now.

444
00:27:36,041 --> 00:27:38,032
Rym: Yeah, now I want to play that game.

445
00:27:38,092 --> 00:27:48,880
Scott: It's like for example, though I would love to say go in a car race again, you know, like if I could drive an f1 car and not die Against you know, even Lewis Hamilton, right?

446
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:58,150
Scott: It'd be great because even though he's gonna lap me like ten times and I'm not maybe I'll stall and who knows what'll happen to Me I'm gonna hike still have the fun of driving the car.

447
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:01,360
Scott: I can still enjoy the experience of playing, right?

448
00:28:01,441 --> 00:28:05,725
Scott: So if you it depends on the game in cat in a game like FPS say quake.

449
00:28:06,286 --> 00:28:10,660
Scott: right if you're up against someone really really really good, especially like quake three that open map.

450
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:16,920
Scott: You know the one where it's just like you're about It's literally spawn railgun to the head spawn railgun to the heads.

451
00:28:18,341 --> 00:28:22,176
Scott: Right, you won't even get to walk around or pick up items or even shoot a rocket.

452
00:28:22,216 --> 00:28:23,020
Scott: so it won't be fun.

453
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:33,596
Scott: But if the game is such where even against a really good player, you can actually still do stuff You just won't win that and maybe even kill him once then it's okay at least by me.

454
00:28:33,917 --> 00:28:35,466
Scott: but against other people They just don't.

455
00:28:35,506 --> 00:28:39,269
Scott: they just can't deal with losing period Want a competitive game.

456
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:41,100
Rym: it appeared to be the better players.

457
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:47,198
Rym: They just want fun avoiding this guy because what the there was a secondary like that was that good.

458
00:28:47,218 --> 00:28:50,720
Rym: Yeah Yeah, so I mean I used to play in clans like Ken.

459
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:58,415
Rym: He was one of our snipers like when we'd like I'd do skirmishes with them or like I'd play Mega TF or weapons factory in weapons factory.

460
00:28:58,677 --> 00:28:59,320
Rym: He was good.

461
00:28:59,421 --> 00:29:04,167
Rym: So if you want you if he was up in the battlements like a do for bad That was just a no-man's land.

462
00:29:04,207 --> 00:29:04,629
Rym: in between.

463
00:29:04,649 --> 00:29:07,600
Rym: the two would be like the snipers dueling and no one could even go out there.

464
00:29:07,982 --> 00:29:11,140
Rym: Everyone had to go alter your roots, but there was a secondary effect.

465
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:14,500
Rym: It's even funnier because it could never find a match.

466
00:29:14,861 --> 00:29:18,516
Rym: It would keep widening the net of who it would match this person up against.

467
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:21,980
Rym: so eventually It would open it up to the lower skill players.

468
00:29:22,301 --> 00:29:26,079
Rym: So he went whenever he did find a game it would only ever be against noobs.

469
00:29:26,902 --> 00:29:28,327
Rym: So it made it even worse.

470
00:29:28,507 --> 00:29:39,160
Scott: and he's just they and then those noobs block him and he fights even newbie or newbie or people And eventually he's just by himself playing against like literally someone who logged in and then died at the controls, right?

471
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:49,080
Scott: so I think the solution one of the solutions to this that I advocate for that know that the game companies seem to hate is to literally Segregate the population right there.

472
00:29:49,181 --> 00:29:52,880
Scott: So again segregating your player base into two, you know or more groups.

473
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:58,259
Scott: Well, you can't it like in lizards games, especially overwatch more than anything have so many players.

474
00:29:58,399 --> 00:29:59,604
Scott: Yes I think that you could.

475
00:29:59,644 --> 00:30:00,769
Scott: they could afford to do it.

476
00:30:00,789 --> 00:30:03,500
Scott: You should have serious mode and not serious mode.

477
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,363
Rym: So that is coming.

478
00:30:04,403 --> 00:30:08,938
Rym: that is actually one of the changes that is coming and in and serious mode should be completely different from.

479
00:30:08,959 --> 00:30:14,444
Rym: serious Mode has different rules and it like like they talked about that like regular mode Just the way the game is.

480
00:30:14,785 --> 00:30:15,388
Rym: you'll often.

481
00:30:15,428 --> 00:30:18,078
Rym: the games will often go into overtime if the teams are well matched.

482
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:22,980
Rym: in Serious mode overtime is a lot more brutal and hopefully a lot more rare.

483
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:33,080
Scott: I also you know, I think that Syria, you know If it what I've been thinking of for serious mode is it should be a lot more serious in terms of the money You bring this up every time.

484
00:30:33,721 --> 00:30:36,000
Scott: Should it be free to be in serious mode?

485
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,149
Scott: because if you're serious, you should be willing to pay money.

486
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,138
Rym: and what if you're good, but just poor?

487
00:30:40,158 --> 00:30:48,039
Scott: I Then if you you know, if you have a bad skills Then you can play in serious mode and you you know As long as you don't decide whether or not you have to pay.

488
00:30:48,602 --> 00:30:53,540
Rym: Hmm, is it gonna be like a vote or whatever and he gets the reverse scholarship or with all that stuff?

489
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,720
Scott: How does the NFL decide who to give fines to when they misbehave?

490
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,207
Rym: Yeah, but they're serious.

491
00:30:58,227 --> 00:30:59,719
Rym: be those people are being paid.

492
00:31:00,262 --> 00:31:04,979
Scott: Right, if you're so good that you're in serious mode and you've done and you've misbehaved then fuck you.

493
00:31:05,544 --> 00:31:06,837
Rym: Yeah, I don't think that's gonna be a problem.

494
00:31:06,858 --> 00:31:07,401
Rym: serious You could.

495
00:31:07,441 --> 00:31:16,660
Scott: you can choose just not to play in serious mode if you can't and I don't think you go into serious mode for And then as long as you don't misbehave you won't have to pay anything.

496
00:31:17,061 --> 00:31:22,420
Rym: I don't think there is enough of a problem of serious mode in games like this to warrant financial penalties.

497
00:31:22,681 --> 00:31:36,005
Scott: I think there should be some real penalties not just like banning and kicking for people who misbehave in a game and then you could ensure that serious mode is Like this beautiful community of happiness because all the shitheads you're fucking kicked out All they do is all they see.

498
00:31:36,045 --> 00:31:37,631
Rym: you're already doing a very good job.

499
00:31:37,671 --> 00:31:38,855
Rym: Like they're bad people.

500
00:31:38,875 --> 00:31:42,800
Scott: Yeah permanently banned Yes, they're permanently banning them, which is fine.

501
00:31:43,061 --> 00:31:46,940
Scott: But but what I would much rather put a bigger hurt on those people.

502
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,064
Rym: Why does the goal?

503
00:31:48,346 --> 00:31:52,442
Rym: I thought the goal of a justice system is one prevent harm To.

504
00:31:52,542 --> 00:31:57,320
Rym: if harm happens or address it to the biggest extent possible punishment is not even a factor.

505
00:31:57,902 --> 00:31:59,307
Rym: So why are you here?

506
00:31:59,548 --> 00:32:00,572
Rym: So keen on punishment?

507
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:04,904
Rym: shouldn't the only goal being to prevent harm You prevent a lot more?

508
00:32:04,924 --> 00:32:10,777
Rym: because oh, so you're saying that by punishing people by causing that kind of harm in a sanctioned way You're preventing more harm.

509
00:32:11,964 --> 00:32:16,500
Scott: Threat of a fine versus the threat of a ban will dissuade people from doing it in.

510
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,543
Rym: the Band is actually going.

511
00:32:18,583 --> 00:32:25,120
Rym: so the other day someone used a derogatory term in a match and I mess it up right away.

512
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:36,027
Rym: It's like I'm gonna report you and he was like what far and I was like you said and you and the player like actually Was like oh and like apologize and then was like super nice the whole rest of the match I'd still report him.

513
00:32:36,712 --> 00:32:42,508
Rym: I did anyway, but But they did apologize and it was like then they were nice the whole rest of the match like.

514
00:32:42,548 --> 00:32:47,380
Rym: that literally happened and That was kind of notable like it stood out in my mind.

515
00:32:53,464 --> 00:33:04,612
Rym: but anyway things of the day Is a cute little blog I found and one of the it's and there's an article here Japanese things in video games and it's basically all these.

516
00:33:04,893 --> 00:33:05,996
Scott: you mean everything cuz.

517
00:33:06,057 --> 00:33:10,013
Scott: video games are Japanese Yeah, but like is it everything in video games Japanese?

518
00:33:10,094 --> 00:33:13,252
Rym: It's in the event There are often sprites.

519
00:33:13,273 --> 00:33:14,380
Scott: I guess they didn't invent video games.

520
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:18,053
Scott: We invented pong and stuff or particular ways of running real video game.

521
00:33:18,093 --> 00:33:28,092
Rym: that like Japan like for example it points out that Japan in video games almost always depicts apples as Fuji apples was like right on top and yellow on the bottom and explains why.

522
00:33:28,113 --> 00:33:29,960
Rym: that's just a way they happen to draw things.

523
00:33:30,384 --> 00:33:44,017
Rym: Yeah, and apparently Most people in the US and much of the world have always thought that that was a pineapple in Pac-man, but it's actually a honeydew or just a melon.

524
00:33:44,037 --> 00:33:47,915
Rym: because apparently Japan They just call all different melons melons and don't really specify the money.

525
00:33:47,955 --> 00:33:48,960
Rym: melon from the other melons.

526
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,632
Scott: I know honeydew doesn't taste like a cantaloupe.

527
00:33:50,652 --> 00:33:56,220
Rym: It's a different melon Yeah, but melons just a generic term as far as I can tell versus a canary melon is way different.

528
00:33:56,381 --> 00:33:58,540
Rym: Everyone always assumed that was a pineapple in Pac-man.

529
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:03,560
Rym: Apparently it's actually a honeydew which they would call a melon and it just so happens the Japan.

530
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:07,500
Rym: They always leave this t-shaped stem on it and that's taken out of the top.

531
00:34:07,621 --> 00:34:12,737
Rym: Everyone thought the sprite was either a grenade or a pineapple But now it's a honeydew melon.

532
00:34:13,862 --> 00:34:19,159
Rym: And my favorite line of this entire thing is peaches are always depicted in this implausible upside-down pose.

533
00:34:19,261 --> 00:34:20,366
Scott: Is this all food related?

534
00:34:20,789 --> 00:34:21,713
Rym: Uh, just the top.

535
00:34:21,754 --> 00:34:28,540
Rym: Here's the whole section on vegetables Okay, and Western foods and the association between fried chicken and Christmas.

536
00:34:30,221 --> 00:34:31,827
Rym: So this is just very interesting.

537
00:34:31,867 --> 00:34:42,759
Rym: if you play a lot of like NES games, especially like those weird Platformers that like you'd see for rental, but like you'd never really played that much You'll see a lot of these as sprites and now you'll know what the hell they are.

538
00:34:43,382 --> 00:34:46,020
Rym: I would have never have guessed that this thing was a baby pacifier.

539
00:34:46,686 --> 00:34:51,389
Scott: Okay Got a thing of the day I do so this dude I don't know how much time he spent on this.

540
00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:52,820
Rym: I mean this baby rattle looks like a push pop.

541
00:34:53,141 --> 00:34:55,533
Scott: Okay, it seems like this dude spent a lot of time on this.

542
00:34:55,553 --> 00:34:57,000
Scott: this video was released today.

543
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,246
Scott: So this thing is brand new.

544
00:34:58,689 --> 00:35:00,840
Scott: He made a doom mod a wad file.

545
00:35:01,021 --> 00:35:06,231
Scott: That is a doom mod and it is a very small doom map But a very elaborate one.

546
00:35:06,251 --> 00:35:08,983
Scott: that is Seinfeld's apartment.

547
00:35:09,644 --> 00:35:10,667
Rym: Scott showed this to me.

548
00:35:11,289 --> 00:35:15,040
Scott: It's it's real good and you don't need to actually download the wad and load it up.

549
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:22,700
Scott: You can just watch the YouTube video, but the one of the best YouTube comments says what's the deal with double-barreled shotguns?

550
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:29,360
Scott: And the best comment in reply to that is why not have three barrels to which I say why not?

551
00:35:31,484 --> 00:35:34,676
Scott: That would be great and totally appropriate for a game like doom.

552
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:35,760
Rym: sometimes I love the internet.

553
00:35:37,742 --> 00:35:41,440
Rym: In the meta moment the book club book a long time ago was the wheel of time.

554
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:52,629
Rym: I'm literally in the last like hundred pages of the last book of the wheel of time But for the book club, you only had to read the first book of the 14 of the wheel of time Not counting new spring, which is the 15th.

555
00:35:52,849 --> 00:35:55,700
Scott: Wait, did we do the episode on wheel of time long time ago?

556
00:35:55,981 --> 00:35:57,146
Scott: I was like, yeah, we did already.

557
00:35:57,207 --> 00:35:57,769
Scott: Yeah, we did.

558
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:03,653
Rym: Okay, but the next book club book Which will start probably right after Connecticut is Oryx and Crick by Margaret Atwood.

559
00:36:04,697 --> 00:36:05,379
Rym: I think that'll be fun.

560
00:36:06,243 --> 00:36:07,300
Rym: Otherwise, we're gonna be a Connecticut.

561
00:36:08,341 --> 00:36:11,349
Scott: When is Connecticut the week after the fourth of July?

562
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:17,345
Rym: Yeah, which is the July 8th 9th and 10th in Hartford Connecticut like three weeks for now.

563
00:36:17,505 --> 00:36:18,308
Rym: Yeah, something like that.

564
00:36:18,889 --> 00:36:20,254
Rym: We were on the panels department.

565
00:36:20,675 --> 00:36:22,400
Rym: The panel schedule is mostly online.

566
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,752
Rym: I got a little bit of work to do to like get everything going.

567
00:36:24,812 --> 00:36:26,280
Rym: but Connecticut's the con.

568
00:36:26,623 --> 00:36:32,015
Rym: But I will warn you our gig nights listeners There's some things that have changed that while the website is being very clear about this.

569
00:36:32,036 --> 00:36:42,660
Rym: I am 100% sure that at least 200 people who show up to Connecticut will not know that this change has occurred.

570
00:36:43,328 --> 00:36:52,180
Rym: the con the Convention Center closes at 9 instead of midnight and then all the 9 p.m To midnight content and the overnight content is in the Marriott Hotel connected.

571
00:36:53,024 --> 00:37:00,942
Rym: I think a lot of people do not know that and it'll be very interesting The people who are surprised when we kick them out of convention center at 855.

572
00:37:00,942 --> 00:37:01,988
Rym: But Connecticut is always fun.

573
00:37:02,008 --> 00:37:04,400
Rym: I would not say fly to Connecticut.

574
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,600
Rym: I'm not say travel multiple days.

575
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:13,160
Scott: You can get to Connecticut by use of a car or walking or bicycling.

576
00:37:13,281 --> 00:37:16,305
Rym: Yeah, even a train Within the same day.

577
00:37:16,385 --> 00:37:17,309
Scott: It's worth going to.

578
00:37:17,409 --> 00:37:23,698
Scott: I know like if you live in like New York City Is it really worth attending Connecticut by Amtrak as an attendee?

579
00:37:23,718 --> 00:37:24,883
Scott: Yes I don't know.

580
00:37:24,984 --> 00:37:28,980
Rym: I would still go to Connecticut because one the price of the Connecticut ticket is so high.

581
00:37:29,162 --> 00:37:30,138
Rym: Oh, well, I would get in for free.

582
00:37:31,162 --> 00:37:33,232
Rym: Plus how higher all we don't pay for conventions.

583
00:37:33,272 --> 00:37:35,040
Rym: I don't think you realize how expensive conventions.

584
00:37:35,121 --> 00:37:39,482
Scott: I think only tax is more expensive than I mean Anime.

585
00:37:39,502 --> 00:37:42,093
Scott: Boston is cheaper than Connecticut anime expos not cheap.

586
00:37:42,133 --> 00:37:53,336
Rym: If you want to go to any you don't want to go to anime But I would go to Connecticut because I'll put it this way One it's the only con we can perform at that isn't gaming and anime.

587
00:37:53,356 --> 00:37:54,400
Scott: That's not a reason to attend it.

588
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,544
Scott: What's the reason to attend it?

589
00:37:55,604 --> 00:38:00,320
Rym: by buying a ticket other than Pax West Pax East Pax South and Pax Australia and magfest?

590
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,446
Rym: It's the best tabletop convention in America.

591
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:04,833
Scott: Sure in terms of just that's right.

592
00:38:04,853 --> 00:38:06,920
Scott: Thank you Jen Khan and fuck you origins.

593
00:38:08,922 --> 00:38:17,680
Rym: Also, it actually has really good panels and like the dealers room They're like all that stuff has all the accoutrement of a convention and I just found kind of go to.

594
00:38:18,482 --> 00:38:20,800
Rym: I might even enjoy it more if I wasn't running everything.

595
00:38:22,282 --> 00:38:26,406
Rym: so we'll be there doing some panels - but Yeah, well, we'll see you there.

596
00:38:26,808 --> 00:38:31,242
Rym: Do not expect to hang out with us if you're there because we'll be busy Otherwise.

597
00:38:31,322 --> 00:38:33,551
Rym: Pax Prime is coming up and Pax dev.

598
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:35,680
Rym: We will debt will definitely be a Pax Prime.

599
00:38:36,303 --> 00:38:38,654
Rym: I assume and hopefully we'll be doing a panel or two at Pax Prime.

600
00:38:39,136 --> 00:38:39,980
Rym: I'll be a Pax dev.

601
00:38:40,442 --> 00:38:41,669
Rym: Maybe Scott will be a Pax day.

602
00:38:41,709 --> 00:38:45,084
Rym: We haven't decided yet and otherwise See you on the internet.

603
00:38:45,506 --> 00:38:46,469
Rym: check out our YouTube videos.

604
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:55,760
Rym: in particular check out our series on me and Scott playing Civ 5 two-player games because two-player Civ 5 is weird and only military matters.

605
00:38:56,583 --> 00:38:58,851
Rym: Uh, I did not defeat you militarily in the last game.

606
00:38:58,892 --> 00:39:01,100
Rym: I didn't do shit militarily you effectively.

607
00:39:01,544 --> 00:39:03,299
Rym: Well, no, I just built a bunch of cities.

608
00:39:04,602 --> 00:39:08,922
Scott: I did know if you didn't build any military then I could have caravanned all day I.

609
00:39:08,943 --> 00:39:13,680
Rym: yeah Scott my huge military was like one unit that walked over and blocked like your transport.

610
00:39:13,922 --> 00:39:16,740
Scott: Right, so I didn't have enough military to push your military out of the way.

611
00:39:16,942 --> 00:39:18,520
Rym: You should have had a stronger economy.

612
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:21,511
Scott: So where that would but that was my economy was those caravans.

613
00:39:21,531 --> 00:39:23,760
Rym: don't make your economy something so dependent on the military.

614
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,283
Scott: I don't know how.

615
00:39:24,303 --> 00:39:24,604
Scott: well that's.

616
00:39:24,624 --> 00:39:25,247
Scott: the thing is how do you?

617
00:39:25,267 --> 00:39:29,082
Scott: there's no way to make an economy and Civ that isn't based on Caravans.

618
00:39:29,103 --> 00:39:30,047
Rym: Yeah, there are ways.

619
00:39:30,228 --> 00:39:32,840
Scott: How do you make a lot of money without caravans or cargo ships?

620
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:38,331
Rym: So I could so in the videos cuz I only put the videos up like once we finish a game I started putting the videos together.

621
00:39:38,351 --> 00:39:45,320
Rym: in the next one You'll see a trick that I pulled where I do build orders and do some bullshit and you're gonna be real mad at what I did.

622
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,827
Scott: How do you make money without caravans a cargo ship?

623
00:39:47,847 --> 00:39:48,709
Rym: There's a few ways.

624
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:54,617
Rym: one way that's real interesting Scott, especially in a game like this lose the race to build a wonder.

625
00:39:54,637 --> 00:40:01,940
Rym: if You are building a wonder and someone beats you to it all the hammers you put into that turn into cash.

626
00:40:02,141 --> 00:40:02,664
Scott: I didn't know that.

627
00:40:02,704 --> 00:40:04,775
Scott: I thought you just lose everything up every Civ.

628
00:40:04,956 --> 00:40:05,780
Rym: It's turned into cash.

629
00:40:06,602 --> 00:40:10,033
Rym: It turned into cash in Civ 2. you like it was fine.

630
00:40:10,053 --> 00:40:11,036
Rym: I would.

631
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:11,597
Rym: very often.

632
00:40:11,637 --> 00:40:16,575
Rym: in fact in Civ 5 I have often gone for wonders because I was so desperate for cash that either.

633
00:40:16,595 --> 00:40:21,357
Scott: Hey, I got a wonder I didn't expect but you know in no Civ ever has there been like a pop-up.

634
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:25,311
Scott: when that happens It says you get you lost X hammers and gained X gold.

635
00:40:25,351 --> 00:40:26,074
Scott: So I never knew that.

636
00:40:26,776 --> 00:40:27,720
Scott: I never knew that until just now.

637
00:40:28,101 --> 00:40:30,030
Rym: Well, you didn't know about the demographics tab.

638
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:38,165
Scott: until you get in the one game that I put on YouTube All I do is I do I move my units and I click next turn and if a city needs to build something I choose it and I click next turn.

639
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:40,415
Rym: I move like individual workers.

640
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:41,540
Scott: I don't pay attention.

641
00:40:41,681 --> 00:40:43,832
Scott: I never I never in my whole life actually paid attention.

642
00:40:43,852 --> 00:40:49,920
Scott: like in Civ 2 in the back in the day I'd open up the city window and they've all these fucking numbers and pictures of barrels of grain and shit.

643
00:40:50,122 --> 00:40:51,656
Scott: I just ignored all that, huh?

644
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,695
Rym: That explains how things are going in the current game.

645
00:40:54,735 --> 00:40:56,870
Rym: then Good luck.

646
00:40:56,891 --> 00:40:57,339
Rym: Have fun.

647
00:40:58,626 --> 00:41:05,480
Rym: So six days ago Scott sent me a link to this reddit thread and It's a pretty amazing thread.

648
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,886
Rym: like I spent a while like.

649
00:41:06,946 --> 00:41:15,820
Rym: I've read a bunch of this thread and it was enjoyable and The title of it is what is the strangest or most unusual strategy in a game?

650
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:20,357
Rym: you've seen that should never worked but worked but wound up actually working.

651
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:40,200
Rym: and We were thinking about this because there's you know We talked a lot about up like we just did in the opening and the overwatch news how a lot of people play games But kind of like how a lot of people watch sports But don't know like they don't follow sports that deeply or they have a hobby But they're kind of idly into it like people who say they're into movies or TV, but they don't really know much about them.

652
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,472
Rym: They kind of consume them and watch them, but that's about it.

653
00:41:43,076 --> 00:41:43,860
Rym: games are the same way.

654
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,720
Rym: They're like any other hobby and it was interesting to see all these people right?

655
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:54,260
Scott: Think about how many people watch Star Wars most people who live in civilized society that have access to movies.

656
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,020
Scott: How many people know?

657
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:58,158
Scott: Who Mon Mothma is?

658
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,046
Scott: Okay, so how many people play board games?

659
00:42:01,307 --> 00:42:02,069
Scott: tons of people.

660
00:42:02,109 --> 00:42:03,233
Scott: board games are getting still.

661
00:42:03,393 --> 00:42:05,420
Scott: even we've been playing them since like our lives.

662
00:42:05,521 --> 00:42:06,933
Scott: But you know euro types.

663
00:42:06,953 --> 00:42:11,412
Scott: since like 2000 It's only been getting more popular over the past 16 plus years.

664
00:42:11,774 --> 00:42:13,620
Scott: right and still increasing in popularity.

665
00:42:13,962 --> 00:42:17,640
Scott: But how many of those board game people right really?

666
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:21,255
Scott: Understand when you should craft and when you should captain in Puerto Rico and why?

667
00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:23,465
Scott: no it's really the same The same percentages.

668
00:42:23,485 --> 00:42:24,008
Scott: people know who.

669
00:42:24,108 --> 00:42:27,263
Scott: you know John Dodonah is yeah I guess.

670
00:42:27,303 --> 00:42:35,312
Rym: what's different about this though like what makes it kind of really interesting to me and again everything That's about to follow is all in good fun because reality is people know

671
00:42:35,392 --> 00:42:40,478
Scott: rims basically just gonna insult all those people who don't know Who Mon Mothma is or what a both end looks like?

672
00:42:42,041 --> 00:42:45,715
Scott: Saying that he's not insulting that like someone who says this isn't racist, but I'm not.

673
00:42:45,755 --> 00:42:46,900
Scott: I'm not insulting you.

674
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:49,420
Rym: But but the thing is with games.

675
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:57,134
Rym: What's very interesting is that I think they're all stupid games I only half agree are a thing you play You're trying to win.

676
00:42:57,154 --> 00:42:59,800
Rym: you'd assume You're at least trying to if there is a win or at least yeah.

677
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:03,840
Rym: Or you think you're trying to win or you're playing patty cake and you're just trying to complete patty cake successfully.

678
00:43:04,445 --> 00:43:05,050
Rym: Or maybe you're not me.

679
00:43:05,071 --> 00:43:05,958
Rym: you're trolling in patty cake.

680
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,489
Scott: Maybe it's mario paint.

681
00:43:07,912 --> 00:43:09,040
Rym: it is very interesting to me.

682
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:15,240
Rym: How many people will say that board gaming is a significant hobby for them and play board games a lot?

683
00:43:15,904 --> 00:43:18,802
Rym: Like to the point that it is the primary Identify.

684
00:43:19,123 --> 00:43:25,980
Rym: it is the primary social currency they bandy about and yet they literally never get better at games.

685
00:43:26,582 --> 00:43:30,297
Scott: They don't have an analytical mindset and they don't try.

686
00:43:30,337 --> 00:43:30,859
Scott: they don't you know.

687
00:43:31,281 --> 00:43:34,020
Scott: They're focused more on the drinking than the act than the gaming.

688
00:43:34,201 --> 00:43:36,471
Scott: Yeah, you know they like the gaming, but they don't like.

689
00:43:36,511 --> 00:43:36,973
Scott: you know they.

690
00:43:37,274 --> 00:43:38,560
Scott: they don't like losing right.

691
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:41,940
Scott: They just like you know fooling around and moving pieces around.

692
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:45,660
Scott: They don't you know think about winning and care and even if they did care about winning.

693
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:48,797
Scott: They can't because they don't think the right way.

694
00:43:48,817 --> 00:43:52,077
Rym: another thing I have noticed this kind of a side thing is there's a lot of people out there who?

695
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:59,100
Rym: Mostly play games with one group of people and that seems to be the source of most of the posts in this reddit.

696
00:43:59,321 --> 00:44:04,080
Scott: Yeah, because it's basically like me and see I think most board game people are exactly that way.

697
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,120
Scott: They have one group especially if you're in the suburbs.

698
00:44:06,369 --> 00:44:09,228
Scott: Yeah They have their group of players And that's the only people they ever play with.

699
00:44:09,308 --> 00:44:22,499
Rym: ever so even if you're all smart and like super trying to win And like even trying to like analyze the games if your group sort of falls into this rhythm It's very likely that there will be a strategy that no one in your group happened to think of.

700
00:44:23,224 --> 00:44:25,319
Rym: That's just how it goes in a small community like that.

701
00:44:25,641 --> 00:44:28,452
Scott: You know the legend even if you're even if you're a really amazing player.

702
00:44:28,472 --> 00:44:31,402
Scott: right you you need You know.

703
00:44:31,422 --> 00:44:33,749
Scott: you need someone to play against to push you.

704
00:44:33,769 --> 00:44:37,700
Scott: you know to get you know to find the optimal path.

705
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:42,074
Scott: Otherwise you'll find some path that like you know is really strong against the people.

706
00:44:42,114 --> 00:44:42,575
Scott: you play again.

707
00:44:42,675 --> 00:44:44,140
Rym: local maxima perhaps right?

708
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,935
Scott: But if you play that way against people.

709
00:44:46,996 --> 00:44:51,880
Scott: actually any good You'll still get hosed But you would never find the way to play against those people and win until you play again.

710
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:55,380
Rym: What was the stories of the go masters going out to the right way province?

711
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,660
Scott: There was some go master who lived in the woods and no one ever beat him.

712
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:01,280
Scott: And then you know the Shogun was like oh my god.

713
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:05,568
Scott: I heard legends of this amazing go master Undefeated from the woods invite him to the capital.

714
00:45:05,588 --> 00:45:11,680
Scott: so he comes to the capital and he just gets blitzed by all the actual go Masters who actually play against each other in the capital.

715
00:45:12,486 --> 00:45:14,560
Rym: So what I kind of want to do is this certain experiment.

716
00:45:14,661 --> 00:45:16,800
Scott: Here's a bunch of stories from go masters in the woods.

717
00:45:16,861 --> 00:45:23,616
Rym: Yeah The top comment the 400 point most voted up thing is all sheep plus sheep poor.

718
00:45:23,636 --> 00:45:25,741
Scott: so first of all that's not strange or unusual At all.

719
00:45:25,882 --> 00:45:29,294
Rym: that's like if some way if the other players don't stop you.

720
00:45:29,836 --> 00:45:31,622
Rym: Yeah like duh Right

721
00:45:32,023 --> 00:45:46,515
Scott: also if so in settlers if there's a bunch of sheep tiles near the sheep port or a bunch of brick tiles near the Brick port so that you don't to build a lot of roads because if you have sheep you're not getting a lot of roads Right now you that you can actually set that up like especially if you can put one of yours.

722
00:45:46,575 --> 00:45:49,708
Scott: if you don't go to place The first settlement I like the six and the eight.

723
00:45:50,149 --> 00:46:00,181
Scott: if there's like a five or a ten or something reasonably Okay next to it that you can put your starting settlement on the sheep port and a sheep and put your other one on a Like.

724
00:46:00,201 --> 00:46:16,311
Scott: you go forth in placement, and you can get cheap sheep, then yeah, okay sure other people are gonna Get resources more often, but you only need to get two sheep to get one of anything Automatically so you can basically catch up to them even though you have lower

725
00:46:16,572 --> 00:46:18,297
Rym: odds and frankly the people who and

726
00:46:18,337 --> 00:46:25,140
Scott: mathematically it could be About equal and then of course luck if swings your way if they're not rolling a lot of sixes and eighths which can happen.

727
00:46:25,281 --> 00:46:27,049
Scott: Yeah, you can win really easily.

728
00:46:27,069 --> 00:46:29,340
Scott: It's like just a couple rolls where you get two sheep.

729
00:46:29,781 --> 00:46:30,464
Scott: It's just like whoo.

730
00:46:31,407 --> 00:46:43,390
Rym: and what's even more interesting is if you don't like if you let this happen Like the kind of person who would let someone get a sheep port and a bunch of easy access to sheep Those are the kinds of people who are gonna lose to that person.

731
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:52,160
Scott: right if I see if I see Rym starting settlements are On my grain grain grain, and I see him put her his first road aiming towards the grain port.

732
00:46:52,861 --> 00:46:59,806
Scott: I'm going to put on the grain port to prevent him from putting a settlement on the grain Settlers game is determined in.

733
00:46:59,846 --> 00:47:04,260
Scott: but say someone who is not really good at settlers isn't going to see that a settlers.

734
00:47:04,441 --> 00:47:06,228
Rym: I can see it from the first road.

735
00:47:06,308 --> 00:47:06,991
Rym: in this order.

736
00:47:07,292 --> 00:47:07,433
Rym: one.

737
00:47:07,453 --> 00:47:08,979
Rym: Do you know how the game works?

738
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:15,000
Rym: You know yes, or no, and if that's tied go down to the next tier which is in fact I didn't even need to put a sediment.

739
00:47:15,081 --> 00:47:17,019
Scott: I just need to put my longest road to black.

740
00:47:17,781 --> 00:47:19,607
Rym: Number two now how the dice shake out.

741
00:47:19,868 --> 00:47:22,076
Rym: number three who place their settlements where?

742
00:47:22,096 --> 00:47:26,770
Rym: in the very beginning of the game The only way you will ever see sheep port plus sheep.

743
00:47:27,171 --> 00:47:37,566
Rym: and actually of all the ports she poured plus sheep is by the best one Because then you're probably doing a sheep grain strategy if we're gonna do the tripods and go for you need rock to get stiffy Cards also right.

744
00:47:37,586 --> 00:47:48,666
Scott: yeah, you can always get some rock with your sheep port But I feel like the brick wood port is actually the best because you can use roads from all you start on brick And woods that have good odds.

745
00:47:48,927 --> 00:47:50,091
Scott: you get a lot of bricks and woods.

746
00:47:50,112 --> 00:47:56,928
Scott: you can road your way over to a brick or a Wood port and put us put a settlement on it then Use that.

747
00:47:57,090 --> 00:48:02,493
Scott: you keep getting bricks and woods But through the rest of the game without having to settle on the rocks grains and sheeps.

748
00:48:02,734 --> 00:48:04,360
Scott: you can get them using the port.

749
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:08,533
Scott: so In the early game you get the roads And then you can upgrade to the cities and then the game is probably over by then.

750
00:48:08,714 --> 00:48:14,518
Rym: the only way you'll ever see this happen In a game of skilled players is if the person who does it had to go forth.

751
00:48:15,303 --> 00:48:15,545
Scott: Sure.

752
00:48:15,706 --> 00:48:16,210
Scott: yeah cuz.

753
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:24,020
Scott: then you can guarantee Because I mean if you're not gonna get the good placement of going first or second on the high odds Spots of where the sixes and eights are you make a perfect?

754
00:48:25,124 --> 00:48:28,660
Scott: You're gonna need to use a port in order to catch up with your bad odds spots.

755
00:48:29,686 --> 00:48:32,365
Rym: so Here's what's real interesting.

756
00:48:32,405 --> 00:48:32,767
Rym: Well.

757
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:34,352
Rym: Here's a comment on that one.

758
00:48:34,372 --> 00:48:35,175
Rym: This is ready.

759
00:48:35,215 --> 00:48:35,898
Rym: my first game.

760
00:48:35,958 --> 00:48:36,540
Rym: I ruled sheep.

761
00:48:36,841 --> 00:48:40,940
Rym: I started naming them and eventually played my monopoly dev card just to get more sheep in my sheep army.

762
00:48:41,863 --> 00:48:45,346
Rym: I didn't win the game you don't say But I felt like a winner.

763
00:48:45,406 --> 00:48:49,525
Scott: you're supposed to trade away all your sheep and then play your monopoly sheep card And then spend them all.

764
00:48:49,565 --> 00:48:50,369
Rym: well, so someone else.

765
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:52,640
Rym: Here's a more fun way to use your monopoly card.

766
00:48:52,741 --> 00:48:55,780
Rym: It'll make you end up with just as many friends as the game of Monopoly.

767
00:48:56,841 --> 00:48:59,099
Scott: It's always like yeah That's baby's first settlers.

768
00:48:59,341 --> 00:49:06,899
Rym: But to look at these these kinds of discussions because it's almost always People who like came up with a clever idea that they don't think anyone else has really come up with like it's.

769
00:49:06,919 --> 00:49:09,079
Scott: like dude I've seen that it's 16 years old that move.

770
00:49:09,925 --> 00:49:25,254
Rym: So Trade all the others and often the strategies are bad, too Like that monopoly thing that only works if it's kind of a noob game anyway, I guess Yeah, I mean if I see Rym is like hey anyone want sheep.

771
00:49:25,495 --> 00:49:26,640
Scott: He starts trading sheep away.

772
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,668
Rym: I'm like Scott's like Rym never trades.

773
00:49:28,868 --> 00:49:29,531
Scott: Yeah, well also.

774
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:30,775
Scott: I'm like no Rym.

775
00:49:30,816 --> 00:49:33,905
Scott: I don't want your fucking she Give me them for free.

776
00:49:33,965 --> 00:49:35,491
Scott: Maybe that's about it.

777
00:49:35,892 --> 00:49:40,090
Scott: I see you trading away a big mountain of sheep But you just take your turn and we'll roll a seven.

778
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:41,276
Scott: you got that fist full of sheep there.

779
00:49:41,336 --> 00:49:46,724
Scott: throw some of them out to the robber Pull this off once.

780
00:49:47,266 --> 00:49:49,092
Rym: yeah a lot of people are obsessed with the sheep thing.

781
00:49:49,995 --> 00:49:57,800
Rym: mmm whatever It's interesting to watching people explain like the situation they've run into now.

782
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:02,600
Rym: There's all these people talking about like fours and fives never get rolled and like nines never get rolled.

783
00:50:02,721 --> 00:50:03,444
Scott: What are you talking about?

784
00:50:03,484 --> 00:50:04,488
Scott: It's based on odds.

785
00:50:04,528 --> 00:50:07,120
Scott: There's dots on the numbers that tell you how much they get rolled.

786
00:50:08,702 --> 00:50:10,009
Rym: There's general disdain for Catan.

787
00:50:10,029 --> 00:50:12,060
Rym: a lot of people myself included feel there's too much like involved.

788
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:16,676
Rym: I think there is exacerbated by many folk my family that think it's 100% strategy.

789
00:50:18,662 --> 00:50:19,747
Scott: It's more strategy than games.

790
00:50:19,787 --> 00:50:20,892
Scott: They're used to yeah.

791
00:50:21,676 --> 00:50:22,440
Rym: Oh, here's a good one.

792
00:50:22,721 --> 00:50:25,414
Rym: We have a friend who doesn't look at her cards and coo.

793
00:50:25,696 --> 00:50:26,359
Rym: does that count?

794
00:50:27,403 --> 00:50:31,180
Rym: She's had enough success To have fun and use it regularly.

795
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:43,970
Rym: It's a dumb game first of all but there's all these people who seemed like a really really trying to explain Whether or not this is a good or bad strategy and a lot of them seem really It doesn't even matter really.

796
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:55,860
Scott: and coo if you look at your cards or not Yeah, well you can do the same thing and you just use whichever power is most advantageous Yeah, and in fact against most people the intimidation of not ever having looked at your own cards is enough to scare them.

797
00:50:56,201 --> 00:50:58,830
Rym: Oh, it makes it harder to read whether you're bluffing or not.

798
00:50:58,910 --> 00:50:59,994
Rym: bluffing doesn't exist.

799
00:51:00,376 --> 00:51:01,219
Rym: Yeah game like this.

800
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:04,833
Scott: Well, I mean you know there are people who try to like actually read.

801
00:51:04,873 --> 00:51:06,620
Scott: other people like look at their eyes and whatever.

802
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:11,779
Scott: But if you didn't look at your own cards, yeah, you don't know if you're but you just do whatever ability you want to you.

803
00:51:12,181 --> 00:51:15,673
Rym: Whoa, here's someone who sees through the gnosis.

804
00:51:15,733 --> 00:51:16,777
Rym: This is a this is great.

805
00:51:17,198 --> 00:51:21,009
Rym: It becomes Impossible to know if you're bluffing or not because you're not bluffing.

806
00:51:21,069 --> 00:51:22,112
Rym: now you're gambling.

807
00:51:22,554 --> 00:51:24,440
Rym: it changes the game to a game of probability.

808
00:51:24,823 --> 00:51:26,720
Rym: But since it's usually only for one player blah blah blah.

809
00:51:28,501 --> 00:51:32,255
Rym: It would utterly lose the nature of coo if the whole whole table played that way.

810
00:51:32,315 --> 00:51:32,877
Rym: I think yep.

811
00:51:32,897 --> 00:51:35,046
Rym: You're right, dude All the all games.

812
00:51:35,086 --> 00:51:36,172
Rym: that's why we don't play settlers.

813
00:51:36,212 --> 00:51:37,016
Rym: that game breaks down.

814
00:51:37,056 --> 00:51:37,739
Scott: we don't play coo.

815
00:51:38,041 --> 00:51:39,680
Rym: That's why you don't play citadels played.

816
00:51:40,161 --> 00:51:43,331
Scott: So once I was done citadels became a game of literally.

817
00:51:43,451 --> 00:51:47,507
Rym: everyone shuffles the cards and plays the round randomly every turn Not every turn.

818
00:51:47,548 --> 00:51:53,794
Rym: but you know, I'd always make it look like I was yeah They well what I would do is I would usually I would narrow it down to two.

819
00:51:53,855 --> 00:51:54,999
Rym: that would be advantageous to me.

820
00:51:55,281 --> 00:52:00,383
Scott: Yeah, because there is some that you pick and it's like yeah if I pick this one, it's really just yeah Useless.

821
00:52:00,403 --> 00:52:04,340
Rym: like if I want to pick the bishop, I'd shuffle the bishop and some random card.

822
00:52:04,882 --> 00:52:11,046
Scott: So I got a 50/50 shot like if I have a whole bunch of red cards, you know, and I picked the merchant It's like it's not helping me.

823
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:11,808
Scott: I you know, I need.

824
00:52:11,909 --> 00:52:15,159
Scott: I need to pick the warlord or like the assassin or the thief or something.

825
00:52:17,962 --> 00:52:22,478
Rym: Lot of people talk about coup diplomacy where my friend Kyle didn't ever say a word.

826
00:52:23,201 --> 00:52:25,912
Rym: We thought he was just being silly bringing Hubert a serious game.

827
00:52:25,953 --> 00:52:26,997
Rym: It didn't think of his movements.

828
00:52:27,559 --> 00:52:31,779
Rym: later He controlled most of Russia Turkey in the Balkans to retrieve him as a threat and we lost.

829
00:52:32,462 --> 00:52:37,020
Scott: I mean you just couldn't you see after like the first turns orders that he took territory from you?

830
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:38,824
Rym: Well, I don't know.

831
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:50,019
Rym: I mean the problem with that game is that to Li with someone, you know Diplomacy is actually very difficult to parse the interactions Unless you've played it a lot and even then like it takes a while to chart it out.

832
00:52:50,322 --> 00:52:52,159
Rym: So planning the interaction is very difficult.

833
00:52:52,521 --> 00:53:03,540
Rym: So I suspect among most people who played diplomacy unless they play it like seriously and regularly Not coordinating with other people and only relying on yourself would probably do you really well for a really long time?

834
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,687
Scott: I mean at least not after the first turn.

835
00:53:05,727 --> 00:53:10,750
Scott: after the second turn you see that this person who hasn't said anything has Only gained territory.

836
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:12,519
Scott: I would unite against them.

837
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:14,628
Rym: Well, what you got to do?

838
00:53:14,668 --> 00:53:17,800
Rym: some bullshit diplomacy with people that I had a non cooperative game.

839
00:53:17,921 --> 00:53:20,319
Scott: I diplomacy with the people who were all you know.

840
00:53:21,002 --> 00:53:25,280
Scott: Obviously he lost that territory by getting that territory by taking it from someone right?

841
00:53:25,681 --> 00:53:28,673
Scott: So and hopefully it wasn't me, but if it was me, I would be.

842
00:53:28,694 --> 00:53:30,300
Scott: you know, I'm the person next to him, right?

843
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:32,900
Scott: So I picked the other person that lost territory to him.

844
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:35,253
Scott: I was like look this guy took land from both of us.

845
00:53:35,695 --> 00:53:37,984
Scott: in the last two turns You and me were teaming up.

846
00:53:38,024 --> 00:53:45,852
Scott: take him out and back you not talking person either to start talking or else we're coming for you Right, and then we go to a room with the other person.

847
00:53:45,892 --> 00:53:49,293
Rym: we make a plan to get him and we get him But then I if I was in the plan to get him.

848
00:53:49,313 --> 00:53:50,119
Rym: I just betray you.

849
00:53:50,622 --> 00:53:51,867
Scott: Why now that you're gonna just get it?

850
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:54,619
Scott: you can just get killed in the back by the guy who's better than you.

851
00:53:54,901 --> 00:53:59,440
Rym: Whoo, I had a friend who won a game of small world underground without declining his empire ever.

852
00:54:00,325 --> 00:54:00,667
Scott: He didn't.

853
00:54:00,707 --> 00:54:01,532
Scott: we must have had it.

854
00:54:01,693 --> 00:54:02,800
Scott: Oh, he destroyed.

855
00:54:03,922 --> 00:54:06,029
Scott: Well, I that must have been a an amazing Empire.

856
00:54:06,049 --> 00:54:09,299
Scott: Yep be you didn't come into the board on to it.

857
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:10,723
Rym: Yeah, no one attacked him.

858
00:54:10,763 --> 00:54:16,640
Rym: more importantly small world has a problem like Vinci was did he say which what match what?

859
00:54:17,241 --> 00:54:17,864
Scott: Empire was.

860
00:54:18,326 --> 00:54:19,512
Rym: let's see iron dwarves.

861
00:54:20,075 --> 00:54:20,980
Scott: What do iron dwarves?

862
00:54:22,042 --> 00:54:27,664
Rym: The underground version of small world immortal iron dwarves Mortally, oh another person.

863
00:54:27,684 --> 00:54:30,010
Rym: I've seen immortal iron dwarves run an entire game.

864
00:54:31,441 --> 00:54:32,811
Scott: Do they have like super defense?

865
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:33,900
Scott: You can't take them out easily.

866
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:34,523
Scott: Is that what it is?

867
00:54:34,563 --> 00:54:34,724
Scott: You can.

868
00:54:34,744 --> 00:54:37,660
Rym: just the best way to counter iron dwarves is too kind.

869
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:38,744
Rym: I think he's typing wrong.

870
00:54:38,784 --> 00:54:41,453
Rym: kill off the dwarves set by the tip Wyatt.

871
00:54:41,915 --> 00:54:46,680
Scott: I can't parse with this person typed Yeah, I mean if they can't beat a guy who hasn't declined to Empire.

872
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:55,300
Scott: but yeah, it's in Vinci small world if you can defend your empire and Because when you decline it you basically take a turn of losing points, right?

873
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:57,549
Scott: But then your new Empire gets you more points.

874
00:54:57,569 --> 00:55:01,766
Scott: where you're declining one still gets you some points and it evens out Yep, so you gotta decline at least once.

875
00:55:02,027 --> 00:55:11,678
Scott: but if you can if you can defend and the territory You've claimed is large enough and worth enough points every turn that you won't actually gain any and no one can it.

876
00:55:11,738 --> 00:55:16,917
Scott: no one assaults You to decrease your point value or they can't because your defense is so strong.

877
00:55:16,957 --> 00:55:17,820
Scott: You can just sit on it.

878
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:18,227
Scott: It's perfect.

879
00:55:18,268 --> 00:55:18,858
Scott: What's wrong with that?

880
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:21,949
Scott: Now the prize is calculating point maximum points per turn.

881
00:55:22,009 --> 00:55:26,102
Rym: the problem is that is you give up the opportunity cost of when you decline You.

882
00:55:26,222 --> 00:55:31,900
Rym: the goal the point the purpose of declining is to come back on the board and fucking roll someone else.

883
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:34,071
Scott: But if you're in first place, you don't need to roll someone else.

884
00:55:34,272 --> 00:55:35,860
Rym: Yep, unless someone's getting close.

885
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,250
Rym: So basically you only decline if you're in that winning strategy.

886
00:55:38,552 --> 00:55:43,814
Rym: if there's a second place person who's close to you You pick an opportune turn and just decline all over them.

887
00:55:43,834 --> 00:55:46,425
Rym: But otherwise, yeah Don't either.

888
00:55:46,646 --> 00:55:54,940
Scott: you guys must have been sucking so much that a you didn't attack him Right B. There was never a better sieve to choose when he declined.

889
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:59,114
Rym: So why'd have been in like a Nash equilibria situation word like no individual player.

890
00:55:59,174 --> 00:56:01,863
Rym: declining would actually be better off Right.

891
00:56:02,084 --> 00:56:04,433
Scott: Also, they're just hanging out in first place.

892
00:56:04,573 --> 00:56:05,537
Scott: if they were in last place.

893
00:56:05,557 --> 00:56:06,300
Scott: Yeah, they're gonna decline.

894
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:07,967
Scott: They needed to catch up by doing something.

895
00:56:08,067 --> 00:56:11,320
Rym: but now the iron I wonder because I haven't played small world underground.

896
00:56:11,521 --> 00:56:15,179
Rym: But it's possible too that the iron dwarves might be slightly degenerate.

897
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:16,647
Rym: Maybe that's I don't know.

898
00:56:16,707 --> 00:56:17,551
Scott: if I don't know what they do.

899
00:56:17,591 --> 00:56:18,416
Scott: What it look up what they do.

900
00:56:18,436 --> 00:56:19,139
Rym: Look up what they do.

901
00:56:19,702 --> 00:56:21,170
Rym: iron is immortal.

902
00:56:21,331 --> 00:56:26,520
Rym: iron dwarves, but Small world unlike Vinci has a set number of turns.

903
00:56:27,504 --> 00:56:27,935
Scott: That's true.

904
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:33,480
Rym: Warves as opposed to Vinci where the game ends when someone gets to a certain number of points.

905
00:56:34,085 --> 00:56:38,807
Rym: So with a fixed number of turns There's a lot more Determinism to how the game will get.

906
00:56:38,827 --> 00:56:42,914
Scott: immortal mean they don't die like you just always have the same number of dudes Even if they get killed.

907
00:56:44,183 --> 00:56:50,140
Rym: So all I found is all these threads of people saying immortal iron dwarves fucking win the game and they never decline.

908
00:56:51,001 --> 00:56:53,249
Rym: There are multiple set people as threads on board game.

909
00:56:53,289 --> 00:56:54,654
Scott: What do they do though?

910
00:56:55,015 --> 00:56:56,280
Scott: silver hammers is immortal mean?

911
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:59,320
Scott: They don't die like you could get killed and you put them back on the board next turn.

912
00:56:59,564 --> 00:57:03,653
Scott: Let's see That's the reason you decline is because your empire shrinking because people are killing it off.

913
00:57:03,693 --> 00:57:07,510
Scott: if they're immortal as the word says Then yeah, you don't need to decline.

914
00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:09,479
Scott: you all used to love the same number of dudes you had before.

915
00:57:11,242 --> 00:57:12,491
Rym: Uh, it's there's mines.

916
00:57:12,511 --> 00:57:13,700
Rym: There's some complicated shit.

917
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:19,590
Rym: So the rules don't make sense without the wider context of the additions in small world underground, I guess yeah I don't know.

918
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:29,940
Rym: But I suspect degenerate combos are a much bigger problem in the small world variant than in the original Vinci just because of the deterministic number of turns.

919
00:57:30,211 --> 00:57:35,866
Rym: Yeah Cuz you can predict if there's only three turns then if I decline now Then I'll come in on the board next turn.

920
00:57:35,907 --> 00:57:39,240
Rym: then I've got one more turn as opposed to Vinci of will the game end?

921
00:57:39,441 --> 00:57:40,346
Rym: Let's figure it out.

922
00:57:40,446 --> 00:57:42,517
Rym: I could make the game end like that kind of stuff.

923
00:57:42,598 --> 00:57:49,728
Rym: Yep I won code words by randomly guessing words that were far away from the other words of my team's color Shouldn't have worked, but we won.

924
00:57:50,451 --> 00:57:51,958
Scott: I mean, I guess you can win that by luck.

925
00:57:52,159 --> 00:57:58,976
Rym: Sure Yeah, you can also win that by Clever innuendo Or just by the right was the right way to play it.

926
00:57:58,997 --> 00:58:05,695
Rym: Yeah I've seen people win Sheriff of Nottingham by focusing almost exclusively on illegal goods.

927
00:58:06,156 --> 00:58:08,045
Rym: lies bribes people at least 80% of the time.

928
00:58:10,002 --> 00:58:11,592
Rym: People say playing honest is best.

929
00:58:11,874 --> 00:58:12,840
Rym: I'm not sure.

930
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:14,906
Rym: Yeah, it's a lot game.

931
00:58:14,946 --> 00:58:25,057
Rym: if you can play Sheriff of Nottingham and you happen to have like five apples in your hand That is the best possible thing you could do right because it's a win-win no matter what right.

932
00:58:25,077 --> 00:58:34,080
Scott: and if someone if no one Calls you out you at least get them the minimum number of points or the five apples and if they open your bag You're just getting even more points and you get your five, you know, busy only benefit, right?

933
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:35,950
Scott: You can get this much or that much and more.

934
00:58:36,433 --> 00:58:37,600
Scott: so that's you know with honesty.

935
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:42,380
Scott: But if you don't have a lot of legal goods, you know, why not try the illegal goods?

936
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:46,126
Scott: You can get you know negative a little bit Maybe not much.

937
00:58:46,166 --> 00:58:58,648
Scott: you can maybe put in some legal ones to cancel it out And if you're get through super big money It's you know, there's not really any sort of weird strategy and Sheriff of Nottingham It's like any.

938
00:58:58,708 --> 00:59:00,140
Scott: pretty much any move is valid.

939
00:59:00,381 --> 00:59:05,397
Rym: I think most strategies people come up with rely on trying to second-guess other people.

940
00:59:05,437 --> 00:59:06,420
Rym: poison cup situation.

941
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:09,353
Scott: Yeah, no, it's just put whatever the fuck you want in the bag and then go for it.

942
00:59:09,514 --> 00:59:12,287
Scott: It's like, you know, yeah It's yeah, they're gonna work.

943
00:59:12,508 --> 00:59:13,795
Scott: They open it or they're not right.

944
00:59:13,875 --> 00:59:22,368
Rym: So there's a strategy I was gonna try at some point but I was thinking of always putting four goods in my bag no matter what and Always offering a two coin bribe no matter what.

945
00:59:22,870 --> 00:59:25,600
Scott: I mean if I have five apples, why would I put four apples?

946
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:28,231
Rym: Well, it's for consistency to remove any human.

947
00:59:28,372 --> 00:59:30,020
Scott: You're just losing a point if you do that.

948
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:32,060
Scott: Maybe more maybe more than a point.

949
00:59:32,501 --> 00:59:36,335
Rym: This guy's favorite play and sheriff is stuffing a bag with five illegals to five crossbows.

950
00:59:36,717 --> 00:59:41,280
Rym: and yeah in the offer I'll give you ten gold if you open everyone's bag including my own.

951
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:47,194
Rym: hmm That's a clever sort of gambit to scare the sheriff.

952
00:59:47,275 --> 00:59:51,658
Scott: I guess I'd say okay Give me the ten and then I'll open all the bags including his.

953
00:59:51,698 --> 00:59:53,423
Scott: yeah Yeah Just like you said.

954
00:59:53,944 --> 01:00:04,522
Rym: cuz actually the the penalty to the sheriff of opening a bag that was legit is way less bad Than the penalty to you if the sheriff opens your bag and you were lying bad Mm-hmm.

955
01:00:05,104 --> 01:00:05,907
Rym: It's real bad.

956
01:00:05,927 --> 01:00:08,355
Rym: If you have five crossbows and the sheriff's like, let me open that bag.

957
01:00:08,375 --> 01:00:09,178
Rym: What's going on in there?

958
01:00:09,198 --> 01:00:17,321
Rym: Yeah But yeah, I mean I like sheriff of Nottingham looks like there's a lot of people talking about it, but The game is not a super good Like.

959
01:00:17,341 --> 01:00:21,440
Scott: if you don't know how you put that in a thread of unusual strategy because the game has no unusual strategy.

960
01:00:21,681 --> 01:00:24,870
Scott: Yeah, it's like there's no valid or invalid moves.

961
01:00:25,512 --> 01:00:27,980
Rym: Oh, we played one game of Catan where I just went for dev cards.

962
01:00:28,225 --> 01:00:31,586
Rym: I guess this guy Rediscovered the old stiffy card strategy.

963
01:00:31,847 --> 01:00:33,934
Scott: You don't say you did that.

964
01:00:34,436 --> 01:00:43,670
Rym: you only had you know Not the usual wheat and stone city and development card strat Just development cards because he couldn't build any settlements.

965
01:00:44,251 --> 01:00:45,134
Rym: You know getting nine points.

966
01:00:45,796 --> 01:00:47,160
Rym: Oh, he's talking about cities and nights.

967
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,426
Scott: Totally different game whatever.

968
01:00:49,627 --> 01:00:50,270
Rym: Yeah, that's it.

969
01:00:50,330 --> 01:00:50,952
Rym: That's not that.

970
01:00:51,414 --> 01:00:52,980
Rym: Let's see take it to ride.

971
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:57,780
Rym: We discovered the best way to get points was to build one good distance route and then pick up tickets.

972
01:00:57,860 --> 01:01:01,112
Rym: You can hopefully finish with a minimal number of branches off your main route.

973
01:01:01,312 --> 01:01:01,613
Scott: Yes.

974
01:01:01,834 --> 01:01:02,597
Scott: That's the base.

975
01:01:02,757 --> 01:01:03,500
Scott: That's not unusual.

976
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:05,006
Scott: That's how you win ticket to ride.

977
01:01:05,087 --> 01:01:12,280
Scott: every time I win ticket to ride which is most of the times I've played I have a Big ass long route and all of my smaller routes are contained within it.

978
01:01:12,621 --> 01:01:16,560
Scott: So I get I put down a train is doing double duty and completing multiple routes.

979
01:01:17,046 --> 01:01:18,040
Rym: Oh, this guy's a troll.

980
01:01:18,121 --> 01:01:19,580
Rym: I ended up having an awful game one.

981
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:23,877
Rym: So I got pissed off and decided to screw everyone else by spending every turn picking up tickets and keeping them all.

982
01:01:24,259 --> 01:01:25,484
Rym: I had no Intention trying to finish them.

983
01:01:25,504 --> 01:01:28,800
Rym: I was just playing a material denial strategy to prevent my friends from doing well.

984
01:01:29,141 --> 01:01:31,067
Rym: I ended with negative 143 points.

985
01:01:31,508 --> 01:01:32,130
Rym: You're just a dick.

986
01:01:32,612 --> 01:01:33,715
Scott: Yeah, fuck you.

987
01:01:33,735 --> 01:01:40,480
Rym: Uh This guy claims to have won a paper rock scissors tournament by always picking rock.

988
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:44,106
Scott: Maybe it's not unusual though.

989
01:01:44,387 --> 01:01:46,775
Scott: Yeah, it just I mean no one noticed.

990
01:01:48,099 --> 01:01:54,971
Rym: Oh There's a bunch of people talking about in viticulture Winning the game by not making any wine.

991
01:01:55,092 --> 01:01:57,420
Scott: wasn't there a situation where they changed the rules so you can do?

992
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:00,380
Rym: Yeah, they had to a rat of that which that's all separate situation.

993
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:03,197
Rym: That's viticulture when we first played it like it.

994
01:02:03,843 --> 01:02:04,164
Rym: It's not.

995
01:02:04,185 --> 01:02:05,953
Rym: that is necessarily that bad of a game like.

996
01:02:05,973 --> 01:02:07,360
Rym: it's clever and I like a lot of what it's doing.

997
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:23,003
Rym: But if the part where the aging of the wines is a little messed up It was like the concepts were too muddled and it was very in elegant mechanically yeah, so I suspected that any deep analysis would find a bunch of either broken strategies or Degenerate stuff.

998
01:02:23,504 --> 01:02:24,588
Rym: It looks like there was one.

999
01:02:24,608 --> 01:02:25,330
Rym: Yep.

1000
01:02:25,571 --> 01:02:30,143
Rym: I didn't winning didn't make anyone not one bottle and People are talking about it.

1001
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:31,126
Scott: Just give wine tours.

1002
01:02:31,467 --> 01:02:35,097
Rym: Yeah, they had to make specific errata to say to fix that.

1003
01:02:35,117 --> 01:02:40,940
Scott: Mm-hmm The problem with any I mean, why did you award someone victory points in your rules for doing something?

1004
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:42,958
Scott: That wasn't making wine in the winemaking game.

1005
01:02:43,625 --> 01:02:53,275
Rym: well, I mean in in Kayla's you can make money by pleasing the king and the giant castle is the whole focus of the game or Just by going after gold and other stuff.

1006
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:53,860
Scott: That's not it.

1007
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:54,944
Scott: It's not easy to do though.

1008
01:02:55,205 --> 01:03:02,454
Scott: And actually those tiles like expansion special tiles that weren't in the original Yeah, yeah, if you didn't have that there's really only one way to win Kayla's.

1009
01:03:02,675 --> 01:03:07,007
Rym: Yeah, unless everyone sucks There's a lot of talk about the rules of.

1010
01:03:07,228 --> 01:03:09,254
Rym: people are not sure what rules are in there's.

1011
01:03:09,616 --> 01:03:13,540
Rym: it's like these people look like They're arguing about how to score farmers in Carcassonne.

1012
01:03:13,721 --> 01:03:23,625
Scott: So these people are into board games enough that they're in the board game reddit subreddit and they're hanging out and commenting But they don't understand the actual games they're playing.

1013
01:03:24,186 --> 01:03:24,908
Rym: Well, you know it.

1014
01:03:25,208 --> 01:03:30,349
Rym: to be fair in this case Different rule books say different things like people don't know.

1015
01:03:30,590 --> 01:03:33,419
Rym: quote any link on this errata like they don't know about it.

1016
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:34,864
Scott: Yeah, but I'm saying in general.

1017
01:03:35,024 --> 01:03:37,070
Rym: I would definitely like to shut this strategy down.

1018
01:03:38,502 --> 01:03:39,268
Scott: It's how about you?

1019
01:03:39,308 --> 01:03:40,718
Scott: just don't play that crappy game.

1020
01:03:40,758 --> 01:03:42,024
Rym: It's okay Yeah, it's kind of a side point.

1021
01:03:42,084 --> 01:03:52,820
Rym: but the games that come out of like their traditional like Eurogamer circuit Tend seem to have a lot of play testing and tend to be at least elegant or don't have degenerate strategies like that.

1022
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:56,820
Rym: Like they'll break down in other more fundamental ways in the long run because all games break down.

1023
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:10,651
Rym: But all these Kickstarter games and like a lot of the games that are coming out of the US or coming out of like newer game designers They seem to skimp on the play testing and like not notice these really bad degenerate strategies Like long after they publish the game.

1024
01:04:10,671 --> 01:04:12,520
Rym: Yeah, that seems like a trend.

1025
01:04:14,876 --> 01:04:16,233
Rym: hmm, oh My god people are talking about that a lot.

1026
01:04:17,981 --> 01:04:22,739
Rym: Friend tried a strategy where he chose prospector every time he chose a role in San Juan and beat us soundly.

1027
01:04:23,302 --> 01:04:24,125
Scott: You guys just sucked.

1028
01:04:24,728 --> 01:04:26,235
Rym: also San Juan is not a good game.

1029
01:04:26,395 --> 01:04:30,308
Rym: Yeah I could see prosper that working pretty well.

1030
01:04:30,368 --> 01:04:32,979
Scott: because the game is everyone keeps choosing everything else for you.

1031
01:04:33,762 --> 01:04:37,640
Scott: You know, well that games also prospector only benefits you and you take it, right?

1032
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:38,945
Rym: It's just so reliant on the cards.

1033
01:04:38,986 --> 01:04:42,220
Rym: you get like if you happen to get silver and full of silver mines.

1034
01:04:42,481 --> 01:04:44,370
Rym: Just play the only building silver mine strategy.

1035
01:04:44,390 --> 01:04:45,455
Rym: You almost guaranteed win.

1036
01:04:45,576 --> 01:04:46,400
Scott: That's how we always won.

1037
01:04:46,741 --> 01:04:49,936
Rym: Yep, the only time I wouldn't win with that is if I didn't draw silver mines.

1038
01:04:50,237 --> 01:04:50,539
Scott: It's a.

1039
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:56,256
Rym: uh My daughter who was five was playing love letter and discarded the countess.

1040
01:04:56,316 --> 01:04:57,020
Rym: on her first turn.

1041
01:04:57,521 --> 01:04:57,923
Rym: It turned out.

1042
01:04:57,963 --> 01:04:59,127
Rym: her other card was the priest.

1043
01:04:59,408 --> 01:05:00,793
Rym: I thought she was making a mistake.

1044
01:05:01,054 --> 01:05:01,516
Rym: She wasn't.

1045
01:05:01,656 --> 01:05:02,579
Rym: she was screwing with us.

1046
01:05:03,081 --> 01:05:05,250
Rym: I threw us off so bad round netted pretty quickly.

1047
01:05:05,270 --> 01:05:07,980
Rym: I kind of stuff just happens in really small short games.

1048
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:12,133
Rym: I mean if there's only a few cards and you draw them the odds are weird.

1049
01:05:12,173 --> 01:05:13,437
Rym: combos come up pretty often.

1050
01:05:13,457 --> 01:05:14,686
Rym: Mm-hmm I also.

1051
01:05:14,728 --> 01:05:19,300
Rym: it's a Love letter is fun because it's quick, but it's not enjoyable.

1052
01:05:19,561 --> 01:05:21,994
Scott: It's also what you get for trying to play the player and not play the game.

1053
01:05:22,014 --> 01:05:29,671
Rym: Yeah Thing is most of these kinds of games will break down to trying to play the player or doing the poison cup thing Don't do that.

1054
01:05:31,381 --> 01:05:35,220
Rym: We were playing a ticket to ride game with a card hoarder who was a new person to our group.

1055
01:05:35,623 --> 01:05:36,590
Rym: Alright so someone came to.

1056
01:05:36,611 --> 01:05:36,711
Rym: it's.

1057
01:05:36,732 --> 01:05:37,719
Rym: a stranger came to town.

1058
01:05:39,261 --> 01:05:40,225
Rym: We were warned.

1059
01:05:40,305 --> 01:05:43,739
Rym: she claims routes only near the end of the game and wins every time.

1060
01:05:44,542 --> 01:05:46,889
Scott: So you even knew what the strategy was in advance?

1061
01:05:47,029 --> 01:05:48,112
Rym: Oh, apparently they crush her.

1062
01:05:48,453 --> 01:05:50,680
Rym: Nobody had ever tried to block her routes before.

1063
01:05:51,581 --> 01:05:56,915
Rym: Okay, so this was the stranger comes to town with the undefeated record and the weird strategy.

1064
01:05:56,935 --> 01:06:01,289
Rym: and she comes to town and in the Town, they're like, we just won't let you finish those routes.

1065
01:06:01,349 --> 01:06:01,510
Rym: Now.

1066
01:06:01,550 --> 01:06:02,854
Rym: What what?

1067
01:06:03,275 --> 01:06:04,660
Scott: Yeah, all the routes have been taken.

1068
01:06:04,942 --> 01:06:05,488
Scott: What are you gonna do?

1069
01:06:05,548 --> 01:06:06,416
Scott: card hoarding person?

1070
01:06:06,436 --> 01:06:09,928
Rym: Yeah I'll card hoard in Alhambra.

1071
01:06:10,009 --> 01:06:12,700
Rym: actually all the card organ Alhambra like ignore the first score.

1072
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:13,963
Scott: Yeah That works a little bit.

1073
01:06:14,024 --> 01:06:15,669
Rym: or die hell out of those.

1074
01:06:15,850 --> 01:06:19,363
Rym: like if you can pick up like a 1 1 2 like little currency Go for it.

1075
01:06:19,865 --> 01:06:21,733
Rym: Just get a giant hand on ones and twos.

1076
01:06:21,753 --> 01:06:23,340
Scott: There's no limit on cards in your hand.

1077
01:06:23,601 --> 01:06:26,012
Rym: There is I'm pretty sure there's no limit on cards in your hand.

1078
01:06:26,032 --> 01:06:26,555
Rym: I don't remember.

1079
01:06:26,575 --> 01:06:29,726
Rym: in a Splendor there's a limit of 10.

1080
01:06:29,726 --> 01:06:32,414
Rym: Yeah, that's real important or splendor wouldn't work.

1081
01:06:33,317 --> 01:06:37,167
Scott: I don't play in splendor lately Uh, I don't lose it splendor too much.

1082
01:06:37,187 --> 01:06:40,760
Rym: Uh, I was there was a pretty close game the other night.

1083
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:46,179
Rym: it was lost in the girls and Natalie was like prime to win.

1084
01:06:46,681 --> 01:06:52,000
Rym: But the whole time Emily was building up this combo and then suddenly Emily was like but but but but points over game over.

1085
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:57,318
Scott: Yeah I mean I've tried to do the both the get lots of small ones and then start getting free stuff.

1086
01:06:57,459 --> 01:07:01,320
Scott: machine Yeah, and I've also tried the big stuff one and I think the small stuff one is just better.

1087
01:07:01,682 --> 01:07:03,290
Scott: Yeah, yeah the cards come out.

1088
01:07:03,330 --> 01:07:05,078
Scott: it's on my turn I get a free card free car.

1089
01:07:05,099 --> 01:07:12,511
Scott: eventually I was like I only have to take tokens in the early game and pretty much every turn after that is just card card card And you'll end the game with like a few big ones.

1090
01:07:12,571 --> 01:07:14,020
Scott: and then I have two or three of the nobles.

1091
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:15,167
Scott: Well, I have to get the nobles.

1092
01:07:15,207 --> 01:07:17,320
Scott: Yeah, so I usually get two or three nobles and I end the game.

1093
01:07:17,601 --> 01:07:21,840
Rym: I usually go for that if I see multiple novers nobles with a heavy overlap of what they want.

1094
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:24,125
Scott: But it's real easy.

1095
01:07:24,165 --> 01:07:30,298
Rym: if there's something you could get for free that is not in the combo of the nobles You're gonna have the discipline to not take it.

1096
01:07:31,341 --> 01:07:35,093
Rym: Mmm, like don't take the freebie that literally doesn't help you spend that turn.

1097
01:07:35,133 --> 01:07:37,140
Rym: picking up gold or spend so many victory points is worth.

1098
01:07:37,261 --> 01:07:40,000
Scott: Sometimes there's a card worth like three points and the nobles were three.

1099
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:43,332
Rym: I once won a three player seven wonders game by not building a single resource.

1100
01:07:43,553 --> 01:07:45,239
Rym: Yeah, that's like strategy number four.

1101
01:07:45,963 --> 01:07:46,909
Rym: Yeah, that's like.

1102
01:07:46,949 --> 01:07:50,263
Rym: that is like a game strategy Constrain stringing.

1103
01:07:50,303 --> 01:07:51,266
Scott: this isn't unusual.

1104
01:07:51,707 --> 01:07:55,500
Scott: Yeah, is there any strategies in the Strad that are actually meet what the title of the thread says?

1105
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:56,626
Scott: Which is unusual.

1106
01:07:57,028 --> 01:07:58,576
Rym: Well, they might be unusual for that group.

1107
01:07:58,958 --> 01:08:03,951
Rym: Sure Founding fathers looking for game of mafia.

1108
01:08:03,971 --> 01:08:04,914
Rym: Oh mafia.

1109
01:08:04,975 --> 01:08:10,711
Rym: with three mafia and 12 town One of the mafia outed himself and offered himself to the chopping block.

1110
01:08:11,373 --> 01:08:13,960
Rym: No one believed him and the mafia won.

1111
01:08:15,762 --> 01:08:22,120
Rym: Okay, uh The only thing I say about mafia is I do still enjoy that game if played like once a year like Illuminati.

1112
01:08:22,383 --> 01:08:26,166
Scott: I just want to play it the original way but I have to communicate during the day.

1113
01:08:26,367 --> 01:08:30,439
Rym: probably the most poignant moment is sort of proving the breakdown of those like perfect strategies.

1114
01:08:30,460 --> 01:08:31,285
Rym: and It's a friend of ours.

1115
01:08:31,305 --> 01:08:31,930
Rym: It was Phil.

1116
01:08:32,495 --> 01:08:33,180
Rym: The game started.

1117
01:08:33,341 --> 01:08:35,548
Rym: He was obviously not mafia and he was like guys.

1118
01:08:35,868 --> 01:08:40,124
Rym: and he was like, let's just systematically eliminate everyone We're guaranteed to win.

1119
01:08:40,384 --> 01:08:51,064
Rym: and he's trying to outline the strategy and all the mafia just like played along with it but then acted confused and gay like started to mess stuff up and It like one round.

1120
01:08:51,104 --> 01:08:53,676
Rym: the strategy failed it misfired and then it was too late.

1121
01:08:53,716 --> 01:08:54,600
Rym: the mafia were guaranteed to win.

1122
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:55,042
Rym: It was over.

1123
01:08:55,584 --> 01:08:57,795
Rym: you can disrupt those things socially pretty easily.

1124
01:08:57,814 --> 01:09:02,471
Rym: Mmm Dracula pirate lord of the high seas furry of Dracula.

1125
01:09:02,511 --> 01:09:04,256
Rym: that is a game strategy.

1126
01:09:04,337 --> 01:09:06,743
Rym: Once again I've played that round.

1127
01:09:06,764 --> 01:09:14,714
Rym: we like you start on an island you go ocean ocean double back ocean And just basically stay off the map for a while.

1128
01:09:14,734 --> 01:09:18,533
Scott: Yep It's too easy for them to find you on land.

1129
01:09:18,573 --> 01:09:21,143
Rym: Yeah Tragedy looper.

1130
01:09:21,162 --> 01:09:22,911
Rym: I don't know what that game is village.

1131
01:09:22,951 --> 01:09:23,573
Rym: Very smart moves.

1132
01:09:23,635 --> 01:09:28,220
Rym: as one of your family members beginning I'm promising new current town hall and have him die of a heart attack on his first day.

1133
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:49,100
Rym: Yeah, that game is all about killing your people like as soon as possible like kill people early and often yeah, which is actually why I don't like the game because the the conceit of the game Sort of breaks like like what the fiction of the game world is and like the analogy of it kind of breaks down when the strategies Really break down to kill people all the time and push the clock.

1134
01:09:49,461 --> 01:09:53,319
Scott: I think that the problem in the game is simply the timing and pacing of it is.

1135
01:09:53,560 --> 01:10:00,293
Scott: It should be a game where you can get a lot more work out of people before they die And then you would get more stuff happening, right?

1136
01:10:00,394 --> 01:10:06,615
Rym: It seems like, you know, it'd be more fun That there are a bunch of people complaining about winning games of small world without ever declining.

1137
01:10:06,636 --> 01:10:13,680
Rym: This is regular small world Skeletons fortified kept putting fortresses down till I was maxed out.

1138
01:10:14,740 --> 01:10:17,315
Rym: Position myself for going after me would be costly.

1139
01:10:17,577 --> 01:10:19,658
Scott: just waited And it worked.

1140
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:24,518
Scott: Yeah Cuz I mean anyone who goes after you to prevent you from winning will not be the winner and you won't.

1141
01:10:24,558 --> 01:10:25,543
Scott: you won't be the Winner either.

1142
01:10:25,905 --> 01:10:30,437
Scott: one of the other people who don't do who don't bite the bullet will be the winner But if no one does it you're gonna win.

1143
01:10:31,362 --> 01:10:36,486
Rym: risk taking over Asia first, uh What's unusual about that?

1144
01:10:36,527 --> 01:10:38,155
Scott: If you can take over Asia you can win the game.

1145
01:10:38,255 --> 01:10:39,200
Rym: Yeah, I mean, it's just dice.

1146
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:42,131
Scott: You might get lucky score the highest point continent first.

1147
01:10:42,633 --> 01:10:43,075
Scott: Okay.

1148
01:10:43,356 --> 01:10:43,677
Scott: What's that?

1149
01:10:43,697 --> 01:10:44,360
Scott: Was that unusual?

1150
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:53,489
Rym: Stone Age starvation strategy, uh Uh Grow a really large family ignore farming and food a hundred percent.

1151
01:10:53,670 --> 01:10:56,578
Rym: Apparently that's a winnable strategy not in Agricola though.

1152
01:10:56,859 --> 01:11:02,993
Rym: Nope that I kind of a problem with all the games that followed after Agricola that are like.

1153
01:11:03,013 --> 01:11:12,009
Rym: in that vein of like make a machine and then You got to feed your people because they all like the analogies start to break down It will lahav like doesn't fucking make any actual sense.

1154
01:11:12,471 --> 01:11:13,173
Rym: It's not a bad game.

1155
01:11:13,193 --> 01:11:14,156
Rym: It doesn't make any sense.

1156
01:11:14,597 --> 01:11:17,504
Rym: Yeah Two player block is.

1157
01:11:17,684 --> 01:11:18,406
Rym: I went first.

1158
01:11:18,627 --> 01:11:23,659
Rym: he mirrored every single move of mine for the entire game except the very last move.

1159
01:11:25,401 --> 01:11:25,863
Scott: They win.

1160
01:11:26,103 --> 01:11:27,628
Rym: he played a better piece and won.

1161
01:11:28,149 --> 01:11:29,213
Rym: we played it again.

1162
01:11:29,353 --> 01:11:31,540
Scott: Why didn't you play that same piece?

1163
01:11:33,121 --> 01:11:35,207
Scott: Also to play right she went first.

1164
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:37,713
Scott: he went second in two-player block.

1165
01:11:37,814 --> 01:11:43,319
Scott: is it should be possible for you to play in such A way that they cannot marry you because you fucking block them?

1166
01:11:43,750 --> 01:11:49,557
Scott: Yep Why do you played a piece in every turn that which could just be mirrored so that you cut the exact same score?

1167
01:11:49,577 --> 01:11:50,219
Scott: and then?

1168
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:57,899
Scott: The very final piece when you could only each play one more piece yet the exact same board You played a suboptimal piece that they can play a better one.

1169
01:11:58,822 --> 01:12:00,206
Scott: So you just stupid.

1170
01:12:00,728 --> 01:12:08,656
Rym: not sure if this is strange or the best but in camel up which he spelled wrong I never roll unless I am first to play on that leg.

1171
01:12:09,078 --> 01:12:12,152
Rym: other than that I always leg bet tiles or overall bets.

1172
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:18,020
Scott: Ah Yes, you I only roll after a whole bunch of betting is happened.

1173
01:12:18,261 --> 01:12:22,679
Rym: No, but he never rolls unless he is the first to play on that leg.

1174
01:12:24,081 --> 01:12:29,020
Scott: If I'm going first why would you go first and give everyone else free information and just take a dollar for yourself?

1175
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:31,419
Rym: It sounds like the opposite of what he should do.

1176
01:12:31,685 --> 01:12:33,666
Scott: Yes I should be betting first.

1177
01:12:33,727 --> 01:12:36,579
Scott: that or the first thing you want to do is put your oasis your desert out.

1178
01:12:36,619 --> 01:12:41,760
Rym: now It depends how many players there are because if you're playing with a small number of players you roll you're gonna get more actions.

1179
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:45,215
Rym: Yeah, it'll come back around to you and all the things you could have taken more like.

1180
01:12:45,476 --> 01:12:47,266
Rym: I could see that working But in a full game no way.

1181
01:12:47,689 --> 01:12:48,433
Rym: Oh, okay.

1182
01:12:48,856 --> 01:12:49,540
Scott: winner of the thread.

1183
01:12:50,122 --> 01:12:52,931
Rym: Someone said someone asterix was like it's camel up.

1184
01:12:53,473 --> 01:12:55,499
Rym: Someone else said no, it's a mole cup.

1185
01:12:58,925 --> 01:12:59,499
Scott: You're the winner.

1186
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:01,786
Rym: Con man out you.

1187
01:13:01,806 --> 01:13:03,212
Rym: that's the funniest thing I've seen all day.

1188
01:13:03,232 --> 01:13:04,116
Scott: Can I go eat now?

1189
01:13:04,517 --> 01:13:05,120
Rym: You want to be done?

1190
01:13:05,301 --> 01:13:05,944
Scott: I want to be done.

1191
01:13:05,964 --> 01:13:06,849
Rym: All right, let me see there.

1192
01:13:06,869 --> 01:13:08,939
Rym: I'm gonna skip through this caching guns.

1193
01:13:11,201 --> 01:13:11,783
Rym: I'm skipping through.

1194
01:13:11,803 --> 01:13:13,911
Rym: there's a lot of interesting stuff in this thread.

1195
01:13:14,473 --> 01:13:16,420
Rym: We'll just leave it at that good hungry.

1196
01:13:22,182 --> 01:13:24,720
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1197
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:29,499
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1198
01:13:29,821 --> 01:13:31,788
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at front row.

1199
01:13:31,828 --> 01:13:34,840
Scott: crew comm for show notes discussion news and more.

1200
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:42,520
Rym: Remember GeekNights is not one but four different shows sci-tech Mondays gaming Tuesdays anime comic Wednesdays and indiscriminate Thursdays.

Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1203
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:52,055
Scott: But unlike those other late shows.

1204
01:13:52,196 --> 01:13:53,499
Scott: It's actually recorded at night

1205
01:14:10,323 --> 01:14:47,547
Rym: And the patrons and the amount of money that they give us on a regular continuing basis are Alan Joyce, Rebecca Dunn, Nicholas Brando, Heidi McNichol, Amanda Duchette, James David White, Christian, close parentheses, Kuntz, MyStady.com, Sean Hayworth, William Isenrose, Jeremy Minor, Chris Reimer, and Thomas Hahn, Israel, Iggy Kid, Matthew Smith, Kjartavishan, Joshua Joestar, Tyler Eller, Don Schleich, Sean Yeager, Clinton Walton, Ren from New Zealand, Robert Lee, Ryan Perrin, Drew Oppenlander, Ray LaValle, Brian Citroni, Rochelle Montanota, Finn, Eric Silverrod, Chris Reimer, and Thomas Hahn, Aaron Cerise, Chris Midkiff, Chris Knox, Flame Darkfire, Sam Cordery, Daniel Redman, Chris Adon, Sean Klein, Chris Reimer, and Thomas Hahn.

1206
01:14:48,669 --> 01:14:54,040
Rym: Multiple of you conspired to make me laugh, and that credit points to.

1207
01:14:55,020 --> 01:14:56,989
Rym: But yeah, many of you have been playing Overwatch with me.

1208
01:14:57,049 --> 01:14:59,320
Rym: Many of you will be playing Overwatch with me.

1209
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:00,664
Rym: Valhalla just came out.

1210
01:15:00,724 --> 01:15:02,612
Rym: I say everyone's playing that instead of Overwatch.

1211
01:15:03,214 --> 01:15:04,600
Rym: But, ConnectiCon's coming up.

1212
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,492
Rym: We're basically done doing the schedule and a lot of the work I have to do before ConnectiCon.

1213
01:15:08,973 --> 01:15:12,243
Rym: So, hopefully this weekend I should get another remastered GeekNights up.

1214
01:15:12,824 --> 01:15:20,060
Rym: I got a whole queue of Rym's Rants, and more importantly, I should have the Utena episode, episode 15 up too.

1215
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:21,262
Rym: It's mostly edited.

1216
01:15:21,282 --> 01:15:23,950
Rym: I just haven't had time to finish it, getting all the ConnectiCon work done.

1217
01:15:24,411 --> 01:15:27,720
Rym: But after ConnectiCon, I have nothing significant to do until PAX.

1218
01:15:28,340 --> 01:15:31,812
Rym: And PAX panels are a lot easier to write because I don't have to schedule the entirety of PAX.

1219
01:15:31,912 --> 01:15:34,280
Rym: I just have to do one or maybe two panels.

1220
01:15:34,980 --> 01:15:37,120
Rym: So anyway, now I leave you with something else.

1221
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:39,425
Media: Here's the baby's bath.

1222
01:15:39,987 --> 01:15:40,488
Media: Here's the baby.

1223
01:15:40,528 --> 01:15:42,874
Media: I'm not even going to try and draw arms and legs.

1224
01:15:42,914 --> 01:15:45,480
Media: So, sad baby because quite frankly, yeah.

1225
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:46,622
Media: Electricity.

1226
01:15:47,284 --> 01:15:50,997
Media: And just for the sake of completeness, let's put its Mr.

1227
01:15:51,037 --> 01:15:51,720
Media: Whippy in its head.

1228
01:15:52,441 --> 01:15:53,006
Media: Whippy.

1229
01:15:53,289 --> 01:15:53,571
Media: Whippy.

1230
01:15:54,076 --> 01:15:54,298
Rym: Whippy.

1231
01:15:56,201 --> 01:15:57,142
Media: And here's the electrode.

1232
01:16:00,026 --> 01:16:00,747
Media: Plugged into the wall.

1233
01:16:01,068 --> 01:16:01,689
Media: Accidentally.

1234
01:16:02,089 --> 01:16:02,610
Media: There's the water.

1235
01:16:04,572 --> 01:16:06,562
Media: And this would act as a potential divider.

1236
01:16:06,582 --> 01:16:09,130
Media: It would be putting out if that was 220.

1237
01:16:09,130 --> 01:16:10,675
Media: This would be putting out 110.

1238
01:16:10,675 --> 01:16:14,870
Media: Roughly the midpoint of, well unless of course, actually how does that go?

1239
01:16:16,251 --> 01:16:17,835
Media: You know, it's quite complex.

1240
01:16:17,915 --> 01:16:19,478
Media: It's quite an odd resistor network.

1241
01:16:19,518 --> 01:16:25,130
Media: But other than that, the water would be forming another resistor from the midpoint of that.

1242
01:16:25,270 --> 01:16:26,955
Media: Oh, this is boiling quite ferociously now.

1243
01:16:27,838 --> 01:16:31,790
Media: The currents, the voltage, the power's going down.

1244
01:16:32,730 --> 01:16:36,910
Media: But yeah, so touching the baby, if it was dropped into that water, you would get a shock.

1245
01:16:36,990 --> 01:16:46,030
Media: But it would depend on the conductivity of the water, how far the baby was from the electrode, and how grounded you were at the time.

1246
01:16:46,510 --> 01:16:49,730
Media: So rubber gloves for baby handling in live water perhaps.
