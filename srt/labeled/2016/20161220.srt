1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,779
Rym: It's Tuesday, December 20th, 2016.

2
00:00:10,779 --> 00:00:11,040
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,712 --> 00:00:14,070
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:15,637
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,697 --> 00:00:18,170
Rym: Tonight, we're talking about Doom.

6
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:18,833
Scott: 2016 Doom.

7
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:20,285
Rym: A new one.

8
00:00:22,192 --> 00:00:22,903
Scott: Let's do this.

9
00:00:25,691 --> 00:00:26,336
Rym: So, uh, yeah.

10
00:00:26,538 --> 00:00:27,769
Rym: I bought the new gaming PC.

11
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,048
Rym: I'm literally recording GeekNights on it now.

12
00:00:31,032 --> 00:00:37,969
Rym: And my record of, since I switched to Intel chips, posting successfully the first time I touched the power button?

13
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:46,363
Scott: Yeah, you know, I think, you know, we were talking, I think, before about how right now is sort of a time to buy the PC.

14
00:00:46,423 --> 00:00:50,490
Scott: because in the one hand, you know, the 1080 is a good time to buy that because it's so new.

15
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:55,290
Scott: And I know there's 1080 TI rumors, but the processor I bought now is the same processor.

16
00:00:55,450 --> 00:01:05,290
Scott: I would have bought like a year ago, the same price, but I'm beginning to think maybe it is a good time because even though the CPU feels so old, like why are you buying the CPU now?

17
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:06,309
Scott: That's already so old.

18
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:07,449
Rym: They ain't going to get faster.

19
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,369
Scott: Is it so stably right now?

20
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:16,930
Scott: The, I, you know, I put an i5 in my HD PC with a 1070, the new one, and that's like, so spice.

21
00:01:17,171 --> 00:01:22,710
Scott: It's like the most stably PC, you know, I'm mispronouncing stable on purpose and not the horse kind.

22
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:28,510
Scott: That's the most stable PC since I've had since the Pentium 3, not even counting the AMD ones, right?

23
00:01:28,716 --> 00:01:28,970
Scott: Yeah.

24
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:35,750
Scott: And my current desktop that has like, is, you know, mad blue screening, which I think is because of the motherboard.

25
00:01:35,951 --> 00:01:36,850
Rym: That has to be the motherboard.

26
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:41,050
Rym: That is, that is what caused my previous computer that replaced the one I just replaced.

27
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:46,670
Scott: So two years ago, I'm sticking with my next time for now and for the foreseeable future, right?

28
00:01:47,331 --> 00:01:50,510
Scott: No more gigabyte motherboards, aces only.

29
00:01:51,394 --> 00:01:53,870
Scott: I don't care if it costs more money, aces only.

30
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,710
Rym: I was going to get the aces 1080.

31
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,950
Scott: You think it's just brand loyalty.

32
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,390
Scott: Brands don't mean anything, right?

33
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,970
Scott: I don't care about brands on clothing and I don't care about the brand on the computer.

34
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,250
Scott: I need to show off the fact that it's aces or whatever.

35
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:12,830
Scott: It's just, I have had in my history of life when buying a bit and aces motherboards as a bit even still around.

36
00:02:12,991 --> 00:02:13,290
Rym: I don't know.

37
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:22,750
Rym: Well, a bit used to be, so in the old days, well, the old days in like the AMD case, seven days, aces and a bit were pretty equivalent.

38
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:33,810
Rym: I think it's dead now, but it used to be better in terms of a bits would have like more USB headers, like more shit you could do on the motherboard, like raid built in and all this like overclocking nonsense.

39
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:37,849
Scott: But they were less stable point is over the course of like 20 years of my life.

40
00:02:38,839 --> 00:02:39,269
Scott: Yeah, aces.

41
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:42,370
Scott: Mobos have never had any problems that I have bought.

42
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,990
Scott: I'm sure other people can disagree.

43
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:50,650
Scott: Just like I got some brand loyalty with Seagate, even though now Samsung is now the king of storage.

44
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:53,010
Scott: I'm talking about spinning magnet, spinning magnet disk.

45
00:02:53,030 --> 00:03:00,810
Rym: You know what's fucked up if you went to Rym 10, 20 years ago and you were like, yo dog, check out this Western digital hard drive.

46
00:03:01,976 --> 00:03:04,490
Scott: Get that not see shit in my face nowadays.

47
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:09,430
Rym: Actually, if you want a spinning disk, Western digital is really falling off the boat.

48
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:10,929
Rym: Get the Western digital black.

49
00:03:11,413 --> 00:03:12,130
Rym: Holy shit.

50
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,250
Rym: Are those things fast?

51
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:14,410
Scott: Those cost more monies, though.

52
00:03:14,554 --> 00:03:14,945
Rym: It's worth it.

53
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:20,250
Rym: So when I'm rocking in this thing, I'm going to post the exact, you know, I don't care about the speed of my magnet disk.

54
00:03:20,792 --> 00:03:24,050
Rym: I do because, uh, because that's the raid.

55
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:27,270
Rym: So I have two Western digital black five terabyte drives in a raid.

56
00:03:27,471 --> 00:03:28,829
Scott: One is such a bad number.

57
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,170
Rym: Yeah, I think it's fine.

58
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:36,210
Scott: Just, you know what I would do make four terabyte partitions on them and throw away that extra terabyte just because it feels weird.

59
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:40,770
Scott: So you could have a nice, but you're okay with six, six gigabyte.

60
00:03:40,852 --> 00:03:41,269
Rym: Why is that?

61
00:03:41,331 --> 00:03:41,608
Rym: Okay.

62
00:03:41,911 --> 00:03:44,889
Scott: It's even, but it's not, it's not great, but at least it's not five.

63
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,624
Rym: I have 10 terabytes.

64
00:03:47,133 --> 00:03:47,609
Rym: That's even.

65
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:48,106
Rym: No, it's not.

66
00:03:48,732 --> 00:03:50,928
Rym: I just split it in two, rated it.

67
00:03:51,571 --> 00:03:58,326
Rym: But, uh, when I'm recording, like Sam capturing video or like capturing, I like to capture directly to the raid.

68
00:03:58,847 --> 00:04:03,710
Rym: because if anything goes wrong, now instead of like, if something crazy happens, then I like lose something.

69
00:04:04,214 --> 00:04:05,670
Rym: I'm not losing shit with the raid.

70
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,810
Rym: It's a good feeling and all my media is there.

71
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:13,690
Rym: So I have this workflow now where I can put out, like if I'm editing 4k video, I can save it just to the raid.

72
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:17,750
Rym: So it's safe before I, you know, cause I got to back it up to the cloud or whatever.

73
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:25,289
Rym: Anyway, it was like $200 more total to have 10 terabytes of black instead of 10 terabytes.

74
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,609
Scott: Point is brand sometimes means something.

75
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:28,040
Scott: Yup.

76
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:28,986
Scott: Sometimes.

77
00:04:29,632 --> 00:04:35,410
Rym: But, uh, the other thing is that if I'd bought the computer a year ago, I would add the exact same processor I have now.

78
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:38,949
Rym: But motherboards got a lot better in the last year.

79
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:44,270
Rym: Like now you can get like six USB threes and a USB three one if you want it.

80
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,330
Scott: They've been revising the same motherboard layout for a long time.

81
00:04:47,373 --> 00:04:47,567
Scott: Yeah.

82
00:04:47,891 --> 00:04:51,710
Rym: Like the previous version of my motherboard, the PR version is great.

83
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:52,989
Rym: They are a version.

84
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:57,809
Rym: The only difference I can see is it's got some bullshit like bling LEDs on it that you can't really turn on.

85
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,950
Scott: That's what the aura means is that the LEDs change color and you can customize the color.

86
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:08,530
Rym: There's a couple other minor differences in the layout and you get, generally you get more USBs and that kind of stuff.

87
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:13,906
Rym: And the reviews, the eggs are better, way fewer RMAs cause.

88
00:05:13,966 --> 00:05:15,150
Rym: it's like an incremental improvement.

89
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:19,170
Scott: Why did you put your computer under your feet and not in the computer hole?

90
00:05:19,972 --> 00:05:24,810
Rym: So there's a lot of reasons for that, but mostly because I'm actually going to put another hard drive in early next year.

91
00:05:25,711 --> 00:05:28,275
Rym: And I can just slide it in without having to unplug all the shit.

92
00:05:30,619 --> 00:05:36,990
Rym: early next year is really soon because I ordered the Samsung nine 60 like M dot two crazy drive.

93
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:42,410
Rym: And the motherfuckers I ordered from sent me a nine 50 like I wouldn't notice.

94
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:49,130
Rym: So they're going to be a full refund because I was like, send me the nine 60. there were like, we don't have any nine sixties.

95
00:05:49,634 --> 00:05:50,429
Scott: That's what I ordered.

96
00:05:50,913 --> 00:05:53,430
Scott: But the, oh, it is the deal.

97
00:05:56,794 --> 00:06:08,049
Rym: The, uh, the story with these SSDs right now is that the Samsung nine 60 pros are out in a five 12 gigabyte configuration for like 350 bucks.

98
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:10,169
Rym: That's insane.

99
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:17,028
Rym: But the five 12 in these nine 50 era was the like top tier in the nine 60 era.

100
00:06:17,931 --> 00:06:23,166
Rym: It's the minimum and the one terabyte and two terabyte ones perform way better.

101
00:06:23,226 --> 00:06:24,730
Rym: for reasons I don't want to get into right now.

102
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:25,630
Rym: That's more of a Monday time.

103
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:26,609
Scott: Whatever's game time.

104
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:38,708
Rym: So if you're going to be really gaming computer guys, wait until like February and you can buy a one terabyte crazy as fast M dot two SSD for your games for like 500, 600 bucks.

105
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:45,150
Rym: That's not overkill necessarily, but it's, it's not crazy.

106
00:06:45,374 --> 00:06:46,329
Rym: It's just excessive.

107
00:06:47,594 --> 00:06:49,450
Rym: So anyway, is there any news other than Mario runner?

108
00:06:49,971 --> 00:06:50,929
Scott: No, it's the only game news.

109
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:54,590
Scott: Even if you go to a gaming news site, it's like the only thing that's on there.

110
00:06:54,790 --> 00:07:00,129
Rym: Super Mario run is kind of a big deal for a lot of reasons because you know, me Tomo and all those things came out.

111
00:07:00,551 --> 00:07:03,450
Rym: Have any of you launched me Tomo in the last four months?

112
00:07:03,997 --> 00:07:04,530
Scott: I don't remember.

113
00:07:05,012 --> 00:07:08,110
Scott: I mean, maybe I don't remember what the day I stopped using it was.

114
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,909
Scott: It could have been four months, less than four months ago.

115
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:12,168
Rym: I actually uninstalled it a couple of weeks ago.

116
00:07:12,792 --> 00:07:14,070
Scott: Do I still have it installed?

117
00:07:15,461 --> 00:07:15,609
Scott: Nope.

118
00:07:16,032 --> 00:07:19,090
Rym: Cause I was, I was, I was messing with some stuff in the app store and I was like, Oh right.

119
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:19,707
Rym: Me Tomo.

120
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:20,124
Rym: Haha.

121
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,045
Rym: And I installed it.

122
00:07:21,857 --> 00:07:22,430
Rym: That was fun.

123
00:07:23,011 --> 00:07:23,928
Scott: It's not installed right now.

124
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:24,419
Rym: Yeah.

125
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:24,941
Rym: Yeah.

126
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:26,208
Rym: Mario run is.

127
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:26,702
Rym: Yup.

128
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:35,590
Rym: But that was a big deal because it was like Nintendo made a good app on a phone because Nintendo has always been kind of bad about using the world, the ecosystem of phone hardware.

129
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:42,420
Scott: Well, they just didn't want, you know, Nintendo is like, we make the games, you know, and we want to sell these hardwares and the games.

130
00:07:42,802 --> 00:07:44,450
Scott: so that, you know, we're all, we're Nintendo.

131
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:45,129
Scott: You know, that's how we do.

132
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,250
Scott: That's all we've always done.

133
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:52,650
Scott: And we're mad stubborn in Japanese or the most Japanese and the most stubborn and they're still the most stubborn.

134
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,190
Scott: And even when they give a little bit, they don't give in all the way.

135
00:07:56,311 --> 00:07:57,869
Scott: They just give in a little tiny bit.

136
00:07:58,075 --> 00:07:58,285
Scott: Yup.

137
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:13,570
Scott: And, but they released, you know, the thing is surprisingly, and Miyamoto said this also, it was like Nintendo and Apple kind of similar keeping secrets, making their own hardware, being really controlling, polishing everything until it's the shiniest.

138
00:08:13,812 --> 00:08:15,429
Scott: You know, being late to the party.

139
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:16,162
Scott: Yup.

140
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:16,587
Scott: Right.

141
00:08:16,991 --> 00:08:20,350
Rym: You know, sometimes being late to the party makes you the life of the party.

142
00:08:20,531 --> 00:08:20,744
Scott: Maybe.

143
00:08:21,294 --> 00:08:21,850
Rym: But sometimes.

144
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:25,650
Scott: The point is Apple and Nintendo, it was obvious to everyone, get along really well.

145
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,329
Scott: Even Apple and Nintendo know this.

146
00:08:27,851 --> 00:08:31,308
Scott: So they put out a real Mario game for iPhone, iPad.

147
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:32,102
Scott: Yeah.

148
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,649
Rym: It's not like Pokemon go.

149
00:08:33,871 --> 00:08:36,690
Rym: That's like kind of a bullshitty AR version of Pokemon.

150
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:42,539
Scott: This is an actual real like, no, you can't say, you know, even if you're one of those pet ants, like.

151
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,370
Scott: this is not a game.

152
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,718
Scott: It is a real video game.

153
00:08:45,738 --> 00:08:49,150
Scott: that is a platforming game and requires skills.

154
00:08:49,431 --> 00:08:51,830
Rym: Had this been released for like the Game Boy.

155
00:08:52,172 --> 00:08:52,850
Scott: And is difficult.

156
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,770
Rym: It would have been fine.

157
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,448
Rym: Like I would have said great and probably bought it.

158
00:08:56,357 --> 00:08:57,349
Scott: Uh, this is the game.

159
00:08:57,876 --> 00:08:58,289
Scott: For 10 bucks?

160
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:02,350
Scott: Yeah, it would have to be a $10 like DS download game or something.

161
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,388
Rym: I would pay 10 bucks to play this on my DS.

162
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:05,670
Scott: Why not?

163
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:09,515
Rym: Like just if it didn't come out on mobile and they were like, Hey, here's a game we made.

164
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:14,530
Rym: And I would be like, sure, because the game design of this thing actually pretty slick and clever.

165
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:17,930
Rym: Like this game is not the simple like baby game you expect.

166
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:22,289
Scott: I mean, all you're doing literally is you have one control, which is tap the screen anywhere.

167
00:09:22,751 --> 00:09:27,828
Scott: And if you tap Mario jumps, if he's already in the air, he does a little spin and slows down for a little bit.

168
00:09:28,491 --> 00:09:44,649
Scott: And you know, it's, it's basically depending on the context of where Mario is on the screen, your tap does something different and you need to tap rapidly sometimes, but mostly with extreme precision timing to get Mario to do the things you want him to do.

169
00:09:45,232 --> 00:09:49,710
Scott: And if, you know, mostly you just want to get Mario to the end of the level, which is ridiculously easy.

170
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,670
Scott: You only have to jump over the holes.

171
00:09:51,971 --> 00:09:56,190
Scott: The bad guys really have a hard time hitting you unless it's like bullet bill or something.

172
00:09:56,231 --> 00:09:56,378
Scott: Yeah.

173
00:09:56,871 --> 00:10:02,130
Scott: Or is like you could run right up to a goomba and Mario will just like vault over it and keep walking.

174
00:10:02,231 --> 00:10:05,190
Scott: If you don't touch jack shit, it's really hard to die.

175
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:09,849
Scott: Sometimes you want to die because that's the only way to go backwards and you can't like this.

176
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:13,607
Scott: No, I'm like, please let there be a piranha plant for me to run into and there isn't.

177
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,289
Scott: and this right because I want it.

178
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,310
Scott: There's no way to go backwards.

179
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:19,988
Scott: Mario just keeps running to the right almost no matter what.

180
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:23,410
Scott: So, you know, it's, it's quite difficult.

181
00:10:23,571 --> 00:10:43,977
Scott: It just, you know, if you want to start doing fancy stuff like you'll see there's an obvious, you know, different path if you go up, but going up requires like three precision wall jumps and then like a precision jump off a bad guy and then another precision job of bad guy and then you can reach those clouds and get a bunch of bonus coins and it's like, all right, let's try to do that.

182
00:10:44,622 --> 00:10:45,810
Scott: and a normal Mario game.

183
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:52,170
Scott: You try to do that and you would fail and you try again and you get it in this.

184
00:10:52,672 --> 00:10:54,950
Scott: You fail and then Mario keeps running to the right.

185
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:55,489
Scott: It's like, fuck you.

186
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,488
Scott: You don't get a second shot.

187
00:10:57,135 --> 00:10:57,870
Scott: You got one shot.

188
00:10:58,097 --> 00:10:58,350
Scott: That's it.

189
00:10:58,430 --> 00:10:59,290
Scott: Now keep going, Mario.

190
00:10:59,290 --> 00:10:59,868
Scott: You got to restore.

191
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:00,649
Scott: You want to try again.

192
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,729
Scott: You want to restart the goddamn level.

193
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:04,749
Scott: It's like, it's like, it's actually hard.

194
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:05,279
Rym: Yup.

195
00:11:05,751 --> 00:11:09,490
Rym: Now there's some fascinating circumstances around this game.

196
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:20,269
Rym: So one, the game, and I'm not going to speculate specifically as to why, but it just so happens that right after the game was announced, it was launched and went live.

197
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:28,130
Rym: Nintendo stock basically collapsed like down 15% since December 12.

198
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:32,355
Scott: I don't know why people are buying and selling that much stock based on one mobile video game.

199
00:11:32,970 --> 00:12:01,929
Rym: I'm not going to necessarily speculate as to whether or not that is the specific cause here, but a lot of people seem to be hinting at the fact that the fact that this game is very poorly rated is a factor because a lot of people might've been looking at this game and deciding that it's a bellwether and whether or not Nintendo is capable of existing in the modern phone app ecosystem and whether or not their ultra premium model, which that's the second part of this.

200
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:08,028
Rym: The fact that this is considered ultra premium was viable because Nintendo charges 10 bucks for this game.

201
00:12:08,232 --> 00:12:09,730
Scott: Well, I think their mistake, right?

202
00:12:09,891 --> 00:12:11,410
Scott: It was sort of a tough decision, right?

203
00:12:11,491 --> 00:12:13,629
Scott: So obviously apple promoted them.

204
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:16,650
Scott: Apple and Nintendo both promoted this thing like crazy.

205
00:12:16,894 --> 00:12:17,850
Scott: It's a big deal, right?

206
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:22,948
Scott: And if Nintendo is going to finally make a real game, that's mobile on someone else's platform.

207
00:12:23,512 --> 00:12:24,518
Scott: It better do well.

208
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,410
Scott: or Nintendo's being like, well, that didn't work.

209
00:12:26,471 --> 00:12:27,249
Scott: Fuck that noise.

210
00:12:27,376 --> 00:12:27,548
Scott: Yeah.

211
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:27,803
Scott: Right.

212
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:32,075
Scott: So, you know, apple did their best to make it do well because look, apple makes a big cut.

213
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:33,649
Scott: They wanted to sell a ton too.

214
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:33,860
Scott: Right.

215
00:12:35,091 --> 00:12:39,448
Scott: And you know, if Nintendo is going to make a lot more games for iOS, that would help apple out a ton.

216
00:12:40,571 --> 00:12:48,177
Scott: Uh, so anyway, so what they did is they needed it to have a big lot of sales and downloads to get it up in the charts.

217
00:12:48,198 --> 00:12:51,430
Scott: because if they do it and it doesn't go up in the charts, well, it looks like a failure.

218
00:12:52,812 --> 00:12:56,069
Scott: So they made it free, but only world one is free.

219
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,341
Scott: World one, one, one, two, one, three, and one, four.

220
00:12:58,421 --> 00:13:00,707
Scott: after world one, four, you got to pay 10 bucks.

221
00:13:01,331 --> 00:13:05,170
Scott: So a lot of people downloaded it and then they were said 10 bucks.

222
00:13:05,311 --> 00:13:08,470
Scott: That's a lot of money for compared to most of the games, not just a lot of money.

223
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,110
Rym: The average.

224
00:13:09,211 --> 00:13:12,330
Rym: So this is where things get interesting in the mobile ecosystem.

225
00:13:13,411 --> 00:13:16,070
Rym: Like two 99 is considered premium.

226
00:13:16,451 --> 00:13:21,965
Scott: It's funny that people will like play hearthstone and buy $70 worth of packs of cards.

227
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:27,290
Rym: I know humans who have put hundreds of dollars into hearthstone, right?

228
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:39,450
Rym: There are people out there like, you know who you are, you, you, who I was talking to on Google about this like two days ago, not spend that much money on hearthstone.

229
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:45,369
Scott: I know it's good, but Jesus son, well, I mean, even the thing is hearthstone, even spending hundreds, it's cheaper than magic.

230
00:13:46,011 --> 00:13:48,769
Scott: It's actually cheap as far as collectible games go.

231
00:13:49,571 --> 00:13:58,210
Scott: But but anyway, yeah, there are two fundamental care people spending more money on free games for bonus shit than they're spending on Mario.

232
00:13:58,311 --> 00:14:00,081
Scott: But then they're complaining that Mario is 10 bucks.

233
00:14:00,102 --> 00:14:03,158
Scott: because psychologically you got this game for free and they got paid 10 bucks.

234
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:05,530
Scott: just made it 10 bucks up front.

235
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:07,878
Scott: Like if you want to play, you got to pay 10 bucks.

236
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,426
Scott: if nobody, the sales would have been low.

237
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,253
Scott: It wouldn't have gone up.

238
00:14:12,314 --> 00:14:14,845
Rym: in the itunes top problem is that freedom.

239
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:17,830
Rym: So it's two, two problems.

240
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:20,584
Rym: One is now you've got this clash of worlds between, you

241
00:14:20,805 --> 00:14:22,895
Scott: also got people who don't got 10 bucks as their kids, but

242
00:14:23,217 --> 00:14:32,829
Rym: gamer people who would self describe as gamers who know about games in a general sense and have a vague basic understanding of the broad ecosystem of gaming as a whole.

243
00:14:33,771 --> 00:14:41,848
Rym: And then you've got the masses, the smart, the app market on phones is pretty much the masses.

244
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:45,910
Rym: And the well for the masses has been poisoned by free to play.

245
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:55,170
Rym: The average person who is not a gamer, when you ask about games, they think about games on their phone and they assume that those games are all free.

246
00:14:56,355 --> 00:14:56,788
Rym: That is it.

247
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:57,870
Rym: That is the ecosystem.

248
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:02,530
Rym: Getting them to pay more than zero is already a big ask.

249
00:15:03,531 --> 00:15:07,729
Rym: And then they download the game that's top of the promotions like, oh, all right, some Mario game.

250
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,410
Rym: I've heard of Mario and they play it and it's fun.

251
00:15:09,872 --> 00:15:14,270
Rym: And then it has for that $10 that is literally insane to them.

252
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:16,469
Rym: Like that is fucking nuts.

253
00:15:17,472 --> 00:15:20,430
Rym: And they're pissed and they're reading the game one star.

254
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:24,463
Rym: And as a result, the game has 60,000 ratings as of Dateline, uh, 6 34 PM, December 20th.

255
00:15:27,071 --> 00:15:33,529
Rym: And its average score is 2.5 and a five star rating system that is effectively zero.

256
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:34,206
Scott: Hmm.

257
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:38,710
Scott: I mean, it's people giving a five stars cause they paid the 10 bucks, didn't care about paying 10 bucks.

258
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:46,970
Rym: Well, the five star people are the people who expected this to be an interesting Mario game and saw that $10 is pretty cheap for a real game.

259
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:54,121
Rym: I mean, it's the cheapest Mario game has ever been, but normal people who don't know about games, give it one star because what the fuck is this bullshit?

260
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:54,443
Rym: $10 WTF made, right?

261
00:15:56,353 --> 00:15:57,570
Scott: They're not judging the game.

262
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:01,349
Scott: They're judging the $10, you know, for any iPhone game ever.

263
00:16:01,851 --> 00:16:06,630
Scott: It also wants to get, you could make fucking like final fantasy.

264
00:16:06,814 --> 00:16:07,450
Scott: What's the new one?

265
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:08,057
Scott: Yup.

266
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:24,790
Scott: You can make final fantasy 16 the whole game, the whole game, iPhone only exclusive, I iOS exclusive and charge 10 bucks for it and, but it's a full final fantasy, just as big as final fantasy 16 should be or will be when it comes out.

267
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,730
Scott: Cause it's definitely going to come out at some point, right?

268
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:27,249
Scott: For years.

269
00:16:28,092 --> 00:16:30,210
Scott: Uh, and people would be like 10 bucks, what the fuck is this shit?

270
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:33,844
Scott: But the same game on PS four people be like game of years, $70.

271
00:16:33,844 --> 00:16:35,089
Scott: don't give a fuck.

272
00:16:35,471 --> 00:16:39,110
Rym: Now that also is interesting cause this gives us some data we never really had before.

273
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:43,650
Rym: The reviews are pretty much all one star or five star.

274
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:50,089
Scott: There's almost nothing in the middle, which there aren't a lot of one star reviews that say paid 10 bucks.

275
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,509
Scott: Don't like this game.

276
00:16:51,671 --> 00:16:52,008
Scott: It's shitty.

277
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:52,870
Scott: Right?

278
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:56,730
Scott: However, there is a part of the game that is not so great, right?

279
00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:01,104
Scott: So the good part of the game, at least as far as I'm concerned is the main solo part of the game.

280
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:05,270
Scott: You play these, it's got like six worlds of four levels each, right?

281
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:16,205
Scott: And in each world, you know, it's a little short levels, but the levels, each level has replayability times three because not only getting to the end of the level is a cake walk.

282
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:24,089
Scott: It's automatically running you there with very little things that will actually kill you and you can come back to life a bunch of times and it's, it's not difficult, right?

283
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:32,805
Scott: I beat the game like on my first shot, just like straight through, but in each level there's five coins to get and you got to get all five coins in one.

284
00:17:32,905 --> 00:17:33,810
Scott: go for it to count.

285
00:17:34,251 --> 00:17:39,090
Scott: So you get all the pink coins, then the level changes and now you get all the purple coins.

286
00:17:39,571 --> 00:17:44,609
Scott: And then when you get all the purple coins in one shot, the level changes and there's the five black coins.

287
00:17:45,172 --> 00:17:46,225
Scott: Fuck the five black coins.

288
00:17:48,511 --> 00:17:52,190
Scott: Not to be racist against those coins because it's not the color that's the problem.

289
00:17:52,312 --> 00:17:53,168
Scott: It is their location.

290
00:17:53,951 --> 00:17:56,790
Scott: The level changes in a very devious fashion.

291
00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:01,669
Scott: You think really how devious could it be a game where you only have to push a, you don't even got to push.

292
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:06,848
Rym: I was looking at some youtube videos and you're like, like it's a spot that you wouldn't even can.

293
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:16,810
Scott: I was able to get all five black coins in world one, one and world one, two and in world one dash three, there's some coins I'm seeing and I'm like, how the fuck do you get?

294
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:24,530
Scott: Like how do you even, and you to make it even worse, like I could maybe get up there if it was a regular Mario game and I could go backwards.

295
00:18:24,851 --> 00:18:25,610
Scott: You can't go backwards.

296
00:18:25,691 --> 00:18:27,070
Scott: You got one shot at each coin.

297
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:27,564
Scott: You miss it.

298
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,027
Scott: Restart the whole goddamn level.

299
00:18:29,493 --> 00:18:30,808
Scott: Oh, I missed the first coin.

300
00:18:31,092 --> 00:18:32,270
Scott: Well, it doesn't matter.

301
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:33,209
Scott: Restart the whole level.

302
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:34,468
Scott: Oh, you missed the fifth coin.

303
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:35,490
Scott: Restart again.

304
00:18:35,591 --> 00:18:36,646
Scott: Go back and get the first guy.

305
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,349
Scott: And he's just like, you know, but that's the good part of the game.

306
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:49,310
Scott: The not so good part of the game is the mobile ish type part of the game where you get toads and coins to build your town like a kind of thing.

307
00:18:49,933 --> 00:18:51,370
Scott: And basically this is toad rallies.

308
00:18:51,430 --> 00:19:02,447
Scott: You get toad rally tickets to go in the toad rally and it basically makes you play a level and you're playing the level against someone else's ghost of that level, like sort of like Mario Kart.

309
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:13,950
Scott: There's a little like paper Mario that does the level in their place and you got to do the level better than they did it, which means getting more coins and more points, which means doing more fancy moves.

310
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:18,370
Scott: You do more fancy moves, you get coin rush, you get more coins, you get more points.

311
00:19:19,371 --> 00:19:25,807
Scott: And if you do the level better than the person you chose to go against, you take some of their toads and you get more toads.

312
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:37,169
Scott: But if they do the level, if you don't do the level better than them, you lose toads and you try and just increase your total toad army to level up your town and also get coins to buy shit for your town.

313
00:19:39,274 --> 00:19:41,249
Scott: And it's sort of love it or hate it kind of thing.

314
00:19:41,691 --> 00:19:43,670
Rym: I see most people seem to love it, which is interesting.

315
00:19:43,871 --> 00:19:52,129
Scott: It's kind of fun to do a toad rally kind of, but not as fun as trying to get all five coins and mastering the levels.

316
00:19:52,973 --> 00:19:55,969
Scott: But I really don't give a shit about what my mushroom kingdom looks like.

317
00:19:56,470 --> 00:20:03,967
Rym: So the five stars are basically the pool of people who are actually gamers who play games on their phones.

318
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:10,187
Rym: The pool of one stars are normal people who have heard of Mario and are pissed off that they have to pay any amount of money.

319
00:20:10,691 --> 00:20:14,590
Scott: Mario is like, you know, the Mercedes of games.

320
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,090
Scott: You ain't going to give me for free.

321
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,030
Rym: So what, pray tell, is in the two, three, four reviews?

322
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:20,329
Rym: And there aren't that many.

323
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:21,428
Rym: So I poked around in them.

324
00:20:22,091 --> 00:20:25,061
Rym: And what I learned is that the two reviews are mostly.

325
00:20:25,081 --> 00:20:29,350
Rym: the game requires an Internet connection 100 percent of the time or it stops working.

326
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:29,906
Rym: That's true.

327
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:32,210
Rym: You can't actually play it on the go on the first.

328
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,370
Scott: Originally, I'm like, man, that sucks.

329
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:38,550
Scott: I would really like to play this game on the subway, but it's a good game, so I'll play it anyway.

330
00:20:38,773 --> 00:20:39,750
Scott: But yeah, that's bullshit.

331
00:20:39,831 --> 00:20:40,930
Scott: You should let me play on the subway.

332
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:41,650
Rym: That is insane.

333
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,109
Rym: Literally no game I own.

334
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:50,810
Rym: I have a lot of games on my phone won't work if I'm underground, however, or especially the solo part of the game, right?

335
00:20:50,893 --> 00:20:51,104
Scott: Yeah.

336
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:55,490
Scott: However, I realized a subway is kind of shaky.

337
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:57,328
Scott: You can't.

338
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:06,030
Scott: It's not good to play a game that even on my 3DS sitting on the subway, I can't play games that are like real time action because it's fucking shaking.

339
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:09,590
Scott: Well, dude, I remember I need absolute stillness and stability.

340
00:21:10,911 --> 00:21:23,606
Rym: I was remastering those beta episodes of GeekNights in 2005 for the Patreon and one of them you're talking about playing the surgeon game on the DS and how you can't play it on the train.

341
00:21:24,631 --> 00:21:25,449
Rym: You'll just kill it.

342
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:26,250
Rym: There's no way.

343
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,350
Scott: So I guess that's not an old van Scott problem.

344
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,870
Scott: That's also, you know, young Scott problem.

345
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:31,870
Rym: But here's all the problems.

346
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:35,229
Rym: Like I couldn't play it in the bathroom at work because there's just no data in there.

347
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:36,010
Scott: See, that's bull.

348
00:21:36,131 --> 00:21:36,709
Scott: That's a problem.

349
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:37,689
Rym: I couldn't play it at PAX.

350
00:21:37,873 --> 00:21:38,608
Rym: Like most taxes.

351
00:21:38,973 --> 00:21:39,750
Rym: You can't get internet.

352
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:40,689
Rym: Like it just doesn't work.

353
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:44,190
Scott: The thing is you just need barely enough internet rather give any data at all.

354
00:21:44,394 --> 00:21:44,908
Scott: It's going to work.

355
00:21:45,051 --> 00:21:46,229
Scott: You don't need like real data.

356
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:53,289
Rym: You know, I can watch a Netflix movie with no internet on my phone now and yet I can't play Super Mario run.

357
00:21:53,951 --> 00:21:55,195
Rym: That just seems.

358
00:21:55,235 --> 00:22:00,087
Scott: Nintendo is, you know, that's who they are, but it still has friend codes and bullshit.

359
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,389
Scott: It doesn't just let you use game center or whatever.

360
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:07,210
Rym: And it seems like all the two and three star reviews are those kinds of complaints.

361
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:10,208
Scott: Like the complaints about the middling bits, right?

362
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:17,387
Scott: Like someone like a four star review might be someone who likes the game, didn't care about spending 10 bucks, but really doesn't like the toad rally, right?

363
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:24,510
Scott: Whereas I look at it and say, well, I don't like the toad rally part either, but they're being extra crap attached to a good game.

364
00:22:24,571 --> 00:22:26,070
Scott: Doesn't diminish the good game.

365
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:26,788
Scott: That's already there.

366
00:22:26,891 --> 00:22:27,020
Scott: Yeah.

367
00:22:27,211 --> 00:22:28,589
Rym: Unless it gets in your way, right?

368
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:35,970
Scott: It's like if I buy Puerto Rico, the best board game there is, and there's 10 garbage expansions in the box and I just throw those out and the rest of the game is still good.

369
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:37,970
Scott: That doesn't make the existing Puerto Rico worse.

370
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:43,909
Rym: But imagine if the expansions were printed on the board and like you had to like ignore them, but they were always there in your way.

371
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,470
Scott: Toad rally's not in your way.

372
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,550
Scott: Just don't touch toad rally.

373
00:22:46,752 --> 00:22:47,330
Scott: It's one button.

374
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:47,925
Scott: Don't touch it.

375
00:22:54,592 --> 00:22:56,970
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

376
00:22:57,153 --> 00:22:58,230
Scott: I got so many things of the day.

377
00:22:58,330 --> 00:22:59,250
Scott: Which one shall I use?

378
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,110
Scott: This great bounty.

379
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:00,430
Scott: I

380
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:16,370
Rym: also have many partly because, well, lot of reasons partly because I also rebuilt the HTPC by cascading parts down and now it's running on an SSD and I was like watching a lot of YouTube videos and there's a bunch of stuff in the living room and I found this just pretty funny little comedy bit.

381
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:32,230
Rym: It's short and it's about, it's the, the workers and sieve and one of them is a worker from like sieve two, three, four and the sieve six guy is explaining to him how his job is different now and it was actually pretty funny.

382
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:33,350
Rym: Like it has a pretty good payoff.

383
00:23:33,471 --> 00:23:33,703
Rym: It was good.

384
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:34,468
Rym: It's short.

385
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:38,450
Scott: All right, so this guy in the Netherlands, a good land.

386
00:23:38,551 --> 00:23:39,528
Scott: It's in the nether places.

387
00:23:40,674 --> 00:23:42,010
Rym: I got good stuff in my nether places.

388
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:49,189
Scott: He, his phone got stolen and he realized like, oh man, shit, if your phone is stolen, that's like the worst.

389
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:51,269
Scott: I guess he didn't realize that before his phone was stolen.

390
00:23:52,090 --> 00:24:04,769
Scott: So then he got a new phone and on that new phone, he put spyware, the kind that lets you completely control the phone from anywhere as long as the phone has internets.

391
00:24:05,411 --> 00:24:10,130
Scott: And then he let this new phone get stole on purpose.

392
00:24:11,678 --> 00:24:12,310
Rym: That ain't bad.

393
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:17,550
Rym: He just like got it hanging like out of his pocket, got the phone stolen on purpose somehow.

394
00:24:18,171 --> 00:24:31,829
Scott: And now he took the footage that was recorded from the spyware on that phone that he collected as much as he could and created this 20 plus minute long short film of the journey of the stolen phone.

395
00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:35,429
Scott: It's a short film known as find my phone.

396
00:24:36,716 --> 00:24:37,388
Scott: It is a good film.

397
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:38,386
Rym: Good stuff.

398
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:40,825
Rym: In the meta moment, the booklet book is Rebecca.

399
00:24:42,312 --> 00:24:42,630
Rym: Rebecca.

400
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:46,247
Rym: Sounds like you're reading it, so I'm going to start reading it in earnest and finish it pretty quick.

401
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:56,748
Scott: I'm reading it quite a, you know, the timer on the Kindle says a number of hours and then it seems to that time it reports goes down faster than the actual clock does like.

402
00:24:56,768 --> 00:24:59,227
Scott: I'll be reading it and I'll be reading it for 15 minutes.

403
00:25:00,073 --> 00:25:03,050
Scott: But the estimated time to finishing went down by like an hour.

404
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:06,265
Scott: And it's like, OK, I guess you're really bad at estimating.

405
00:25:06,325 --> 00:25:07,886
Scott: I'm going to finish this when I don't know.

406
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:15,770
Rym: Otherwise, we're going to be at Magfest doing six panels across four days of Magfest.

407
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:17,630
Rym: Oh, it's coming.

408
00:25:18,151 --> 00:25:19,710
Rym: I'm feeling Magfest real hard.

409
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:25,249
Scott: Like I only have one and a half more days of work.

410
00:25:25,734 --> 00:25:26,370
Rym: All right.

411
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:28,930
Scott: In 2016.

412
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:42,229
Scott: And then, you know, how many days of work I have before Magfest, zero, three and a half more days of work because I go back to work on like the Tuesday and then work on a Wednesday and then a Magfest on a Thursday.

413
00:25:42,771 --> 00:25:47,769
Rym: Like Pax is super fun, but I go to between three and five Pax's a year.

414
00:25:48,712 --> 00:25:50,430
Scott: So there's only one Magfest.

415
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:50,806
Rym: Yeah.

416
00:25:50,911 --> 00:25:52,349
Rym: Like Pax I'm excited about.

417
00:25:52,712 --> 00:25:56,608
Rym: But but like right after Pax Prime, I'm not like, oh, man, I got to wait another year for this.

418
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:58,410
Rym: Like, oh, there's another Pax coming.

419
00:25:58,610 --> 00:25:59,470
Rym: Like pretty soon, actually.

420
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:00,009
Rym: Pax out.

421
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,629
Scott: Let's go after Magfest is over.

422
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:01,910
Scott: Yeah.

423
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:02,329
Scott: Pax out.

424
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:03,847
Rym: Pax out is like right there.

425
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:06,229
Rym: So right after Magfest, we're going to Pax out.

426
00:26:06,971 --> 00:26:08,910
Scott: And if you want to enforce it, Pax East.

427
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:12,210
Scott: If you are a previous Pax East enforcer, do stuff.

428
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:12,659
Rym: Yep.

429
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:13,490
Rym: Stuff's happening.

430
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:14,269
Scott: Stuff is now.

431
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:14,904
Rym: Do your stuff.

432
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:16,968
Rym: Uh, yeah.

433
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:20,924
Rym: Otherwise, the Patreon for Geek Knights is going strong and I'm uploading more and more content.

434
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:29,430
Rym: I think Emily and I will be reviewing the new Doctor Strange movie pretty soon because actually Emily read all the Doctor Strange comics a long time ago and I never did.

435
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:32,190
Rym: So we had different perspectives on the movie, which is interesting.

436
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:33,126
Scott: You and me.

437
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:37,130
Scott: There's there are many various different Doctor Strange comics.

438
00:26:37,793 --> 00:26:39,850
Rym: I feel like everyone, cause I haven't read any of them.

439
00:26:40,431 --> 00:26:41,836
Scott: There's so many different ones.

440
00:26:41,916 --> 00:26:54,150
Scott: is like, you know, you could almost like if you read some new ones and someone else read some old ones and someone else read some like nineties ones, but it's like everyone would think something different about, you know, Doctor Strange.

441
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:54,607
Scott: Yup.

442
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:55,686
Scott: Like who he is.

443
00:26:56,650 --> 00:27:02,425
Rym: So all that aside, Scott a while ago played the new 2016 doom and he told me I should play it.

444
00:27:03,571 --> 00:27:17,929
Rym: I installed it on my previous computer and it was not a good enough experience to where I would be willing to play it all the way through the 770 and the Nehalem, uh, I seven and the 12 gigabytes of Ram.

445
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:19,127
Rym: Not enough.

446
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:23,270
Scott: I played it on my six 80 and originally it was running just fine.

447
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,130
Scott: I mean like it wasn't beautiful and amazing.

448
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:29,910
Scott: It was just, it was plenty good, uh, but it was crashy a bit and I thought this was related to the blue screens.

449
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:46,570
Scott: I mean I busted computer, but actually apparently it was cause of this crappy DRM that they included in it and that DRM in a patch that came out after I beat the game has been removed, but I was able to reduce the crashiness quite a bit also by lowering the settings.

450
00:27:47,091 --> 00:27:53,313
Scott: So I use the settings suggested by the G force experience and not the settings suggested by the

451
00:27:53,353 --> 00:28:03,070
Rym: G force experience on my seven 70, which is a way better is well faster than your six 80 and a lot of ways that are relevant for gaming, but my motherboards old.

452
00:28:03,171 --> 00:28:05,210
Rym: So the seven 70 wasn't running at full potential.

453
00:28:05,872 --> 00:28:08,105
Rym: So it's kind of like a wash game.

454
00:28:08,125 --> 00:28:08,930
Rym: didn't look that great.

455
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:18,150
Scott: Like it was playable, but I mean I had it on low, I originally had it on the medium settings that were suggested and it looked just fine on the low settings.

456
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:20,010
Scott: It also looked just fine.

457
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:26,159
Scott: It wasn't like back in the day where you turn the settings down in tribes too and everything's just like gray rectangles on the new computer.

458
00:28:26,199 --> 00:28:32,885
Rym: cause I got the 10 80, uh, I sure it looks better to the absolute 100% maximum like crazy.

459
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:39,010
Rym: Like I turned on the shit that you would not turn on on a 10 70.

460
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:44,070
Rym: Holy shit, does it look different and locked 60 FPS the entire time.

461
00:28:44,331 --> 00:28:45,290
Rym: It is beautiful.

462
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:50,760
Rym: Even Emily, like I'm playing the game and even in the right in the beginning, you know when you're like inside the UAC facility,

463
00:28:51,001 --> 00:28:52,066
Scott: the triple a game is new

464
00:28:52,207 --> 00:28:57,619
Rym: and then you see that door and you can go outside and you see like the orange Mad Max dystopia of Mars out there.

465
00:28:58,215 --> 00:28:58,927
Rym: You walk out.

466
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:06,750
Rym: Emily was standing behind me and she was like, holy shit, it looks great by the 10 80 guys like Jesus.

467
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:07,685
Rym: Oh my God.

468
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:14,934
Scott: Or I mean the other thing, right, is like, uh, it looks great, but I'm still the same mind I was in.

469
00:29:14,974 --> 00:29:18,429
Scott: like the nineties where it's like, I don't care about graphics that much.

470
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:19,566
Scott: I care about the game.

471
00:29:20,019 --> 00:29:20,229
Scott: Yeah.

472
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:23,405
Scott: The game's just as good on the seven seventies.

473
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:27,130
Scott: You don't even notice the graphics while you're playing, right?

474
00:29:28,473 --> 00:29:33,890
Rym: But the thing is when I was playing with the 10 80, like when I played that great, are they $600?

475
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:34,004
Scott: Great.

476
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:36,410
Scott: Is that really worth $600?

477
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:36,970
Rym: Well, here's the thing.

478
00:29:37,211 --> 00:29:39,669
Scott: You can play the game with a video card that costs half as much.

479
00:29:40,292 --> 00:29:43,110
Rym: It's not just that it looks crazy great.

480
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:49,270
Scott: Like you could get the 10 70 if you're, you can play this thing with like a nine something just fine.

481
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:51,470
Rym: Maybe like a nine 79 80.

482
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:51,849
Scott: Yeah, sure.

483
00:29:52,112 --> 00:29:52,366
Scott: Why not?

484
00:29:52,591 --> 00:29:54,989
Rym: You might get occasional frame dips unless you turn stuff down.

485
00:29:55,336 --> 00:29:55,667
Scott: Oh no.

486
00:29:56,451 --> 00:30:01,670
Rym: I, because I've been playing a lot of like semi serious FPS is again, frame dips are.

487
00:30:01,792 --> 00:30:03,270
Rym: I will not tolerate a frame dip.

488
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:05,290
Rym: Like I cannot play with frame dips anymore.

489
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,450
Rym: Like I will turn down everything.

490
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:12,414
Rym: It will be gray models with no lighting in the background before I will take a frame dip.

491
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,210
Scott: And I was mostly just upset about crashing.

492
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:15,930
Scott: It wasn't crashing.

493
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,765
Scott: I was just, I was fine at 30 FPS.

494
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:26,890
Rym: So it was crashing until I turned the settings way down in the seven 70. but I think I was overheating the seven 70. but anyway, enough of that.

495
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:31,710
Rym: The game is a worthy successor to doom in a lot of ways.

496
00:30:31,731 --> 00:30:32,407
Scott: It's not doom.

497
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:33,211
Scott: It's like.

498
00:30:33,613 --> 00:30:39,830
Scott: part of it is doom and part of it's not doomed, but it's still a good fun single player FPS kind of thing.

499
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,069
Rym: Part of it's half life too.

500
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:45,489
Scott: Part of it is half life too, but pretty good half life too.

501
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:49,570
Scott: Like kinda like not as, it's not as good at half life too as half life too.

502
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:51,730
Rym: Like here's the thing that half life two does is real.

503
00:30:52,175 --> 00:30:53,110
Rym: It's a good thing to bring up.

504
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:54,149
Rym: Half life two will have two.

505
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:56,149
Rym: There's two like hallmarks of half life too.

506
00:30:56,592 --> 00:31:04,050
Rym: One of them is you're in a room, you can walk around, but there's kind of a cinematic happening around you and it won't let you leave until all the people stop talking.

507
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:05,930
Rym: Doom and half life two both do that.

508
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:06,106
Scott: Yeah.

509
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:08,229
Scott: Doom does not have cut scenes really.

510
00:31:08,631 --> 00:31:09,829
Scott: Oh, it has a few actually.

511
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:12,910
Rym: But even then, they're pretty insignificant.

512
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:15,028
Scott: That's not like it stops and shows you a fucking movie.

513
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:18,004
Rym: And two with the thing that half life two did brilliantly.

514
00:31:18,064 --> 00:31:22,143
Rym: that like, like that is why that game is to this day, like such a brilliant game is.

515
00:31:22,203 --> 00:31:30,210
Rym: it will get you into a mood where you do things that feel natural and are guided subtly into doing things that end up feeling very cinematic.

516
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:50,289
Rym: Like the best example of that is in the, in the like apartment tower in the early part of half life two, where like you're talking to some people and they're like barred guards are busting in in the basement and you're like trying to get away and like you jumped through the window and like the game doesn't necessarily railroad you into that, but it sort of guides you into doing this really cinematic thing.

517
00:31:50,932 --> 00:31:58,389
Rym: Doom does that several times, not as well as half life two did, but way better than any game other than half life two has ever done it.

518
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:04,110
Scott: So here, I mean, mostly it's a single player FPS game with levels and you beat it eventually, right?

519
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:11,381
Scott: Now here's where, here's how the flow of it works and how it differs subtly and maybe not so subtly from other FPS.

520
00:32:11,441 --> 00:32:12,690
Scott: is that are single player, right?

521
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:25,845
Scott: First of all, uh, you know, the maps are very doomish and that, you know, you even have, you can press tab to look at the map and you get the key to open the key door and then you get the other key to open the other key door, right?

522
00:32:26,751 --> 00:32:34,490
Scott: And the weapon will be up on a pedestal and a real, it's like the level design, despite it being modern and 3d is very doom inspired.

523
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:41,670
Rym: It felt real close to like the levels in the second and third thirds of doom two in particular.

524
00:32:41,962 --> 00:32:42,129
Scott: Yup.

525
00:32:42,971 --> 00:32:47,689
Scott: Uh, you know, the music and the music, the combat is very doom, right?

526
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:51,927
Scott: It's pretty much the doom soundtrack, but played with real guitars and not with a mini controller.

527
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:53,270
Rym: I'm going to tell you, I didn't think about it.

528
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:55,270
Rym: Like the game starts and this metal music starts.

529
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:56,008
Rym: I'm like, all right.

530
00:32:56,350 --> 00:33:06,789
Rym: But then the metal music kind of like how the Wolverine versus the X-Men had the melody from the old nineties X-Men cartoon in it just like done modern and like changed up.

531
00:33:07,571 --> 00:33:11,090
Rym: You hear the original doom melody, like come in and it's good.

532
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,008
Scott: The music is good.

533
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:18,116
Scott: However, it didn't get me as pumped as original doom music, but it got me like 80% of the 80% there.

534
00:33:18,732 --> 00:33:18,821
Scott: Yeah.

535
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:24,795
Scott: It's not bad, but it's like the original doom music, like it's like, it's just like tribes too.

536
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:26,788
Scott: It's like, Oh man, you are ready to go.

537
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:30,650
Rym: But what it does differently is that it has semi dynamic music.

538
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:33,470
Rym: So doom would have like a pumping up song.

539
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:36,090
Rym: Like every, every level has a different music in the music.

540
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:41,402
Scott: I'm going to tell you a bad secret and that the music and doom isn't as dynamic as you think it is.

541
00:33:41,772 --> 00:33:42,669
Rym: Uh, in this doom.

542
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:43,090
Rym: Yeah.

543
00:33:43,231 --> 00:33:44,990
Rym: I know I have figured out the triggers already.

544
00:33:45,172 --> 00:33:45,467
Scott: Okay.

545
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:52,949
Rym: It's basically, did you find the thing that you have to do in the level that's causing the like more monsters to appear or not?

546
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:55,210
Scott: Oh, that's not how it works either, but okay.

547
00:33:55,710 --> 00:34:01,161
Rym: Cause that's, that's the only thing I noticed so far is that, you know, when you find the thing and like pull the heart out and then a bunch of monsters appear and you gotta fight them.

548
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:01,590
Scott: Yup.

549
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:05,050
Rym: The music will like kick into high gear then until you beat them all.

550
00:34:05,311 --> 00:34:06,649
Scott: So you didn't play the whole game.

551
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:07,150
Rym: Not yet.

552
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:09,599
Scott: But basically the structure of each level.

553
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:12,210
Scott: in regular doom, do one doom too, right?

554
00:34:12,311 --> 00:34:14,070
Scott: It's just get to the fucking exit.

555
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:14,748
Scott: Holy shit.

556
00:34:15,491 --> 00:34:18,710
Rym: Every level is its own thing and the music is just the level.

557
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:23,949
Scott: It's just get to the goddamn exit as quickly or as safely as you possibly can.

558
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:27,109
Scott: And if you're killing demons on the way, do that.

559
00:34:27,693 --> 00:34:29,210
Scott: This doom is not like that.

560
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:35,250
Scott: What will happen in this doom is that you will go into areas and it will lock you in basically each level.

561
00:34:35,351 --> 00:34:37,350
Scott: There's only like token bad guys around.

562
00:34:37,489 --> 00:34:39,750
Scott: There aren't really a lot of demons around, right?

563
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:46,230
Scott: There's only a few here and there to sort of fill up the environment and they're usually the weak kind that really can't do anything to you and go down.

564
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:56,949
Scott: It's like one regular shotgun shot, but you'll get into an area that's either locks you in right with physically locking the doors behind you or locking the doors in front of you.

565
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:58,355
Scott: So you can't proceed or both.

566
00:34:59,399 --> 00:35:05,670
Scott: or has one of the like an item that you interact with, like grab the key or push a button or the gory heart out of the gore thing.

567
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:05,886
Rym: Yeah.

568
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:07,410
Scott: Pull the gory heart of the gore thing.

569
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:09,830
Scott: And it's like, okay, now is combat time.

570
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:15,448
Scott: So it's like combat time in regular doom, do one, do two is always like do two.

571
00:35:15,909 --> 00:35:18,770
Rym: level will start and there's like a siren even coming at you.

572
00:35:19,071 --> 00:35:22,049
Scott: It's like, go, go, go, do not stop ever in this.

573
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:26,109
Scott: It's walk around and chill, then combat time.

574
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:36,950
Scott: Then you must kill every bad guy during combat time and then combat time ends and you can chill again and you, it's, it's, it's exploring time, combat time, exploring time, combat time.

575
00:35:37,151 --> 00:35:41,590
Rym: I'm looking for the level because the entire game so far reminds me of one specific level in doom too.

576
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:45,513
Scott: I just got to remember which one it is, but the whole game is like this from beginning to end.

577
00:35:46,134 --> 00:35:52,354
Rym: tricks and traps in doom to this entire game feels like that map, map eight in doom too.

578
00:35:52,751 --> 00:35:54,309
Scott: It's just explore time, combat time.

579
00:35:55,055 --> 00:35:55,809
Scott: One after another.

580
00:35:56,857 --> 00:35:57,087
Scott: Yeah.

581
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:01,210
Scott: You explore as much as you can get as much goodies as you can.

582
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:02,905
Scott: There's a lot of secrets just like doom, right?

583
00:36:03,551 --> 00:36:03,742
Scott: You know?

584
00:36:04,272 --> 00:36:09,610
Scott: And then when you're ready for the combat, you start the combat and you have to kill all the demons.

585
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:16,030
Scott: If there's even one demon you failed to kill, the music will still be, you know, rocking on and you got to, you know, that's a bad guy somewhere.

586
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:18,040
Scott: You got to find the problem is half the time.

587
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:21,798
Rym: it's like one imp who's just like fucking around and you can't, there have been times.

588
00:36:21,818 --> 00:36:26,369
Scott: there was a time, uh, one time where the music kept playing and I ran around for 10 minutes.

589
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:27,399
Scott: It couldn't find the guy.

590
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,349
Rym: that happened to me too.

591
00:36:28,591 --> 00:36:30,209
Scott: So I quit and redid it.

592
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:32,310
Scott: And I, that second time was just fine.

593
00:36:32,471 --> 00:36:37,690
Rym: I found the guy and luckily I leveled up the, uh, the, the assault rifle with all the zoom damage stuff.

594
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:40,010
Scott: I also, that was also my weapon of choice.

595
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:45,783
Scott: The zoomy assault rifle that I upgraded all the way, but it felt so undoomed like to use that.

596
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:46,429
Scott: Yeah.

597
00:36:46,590 --> 00:37:00,709
Scott: It's not about zooming and sniping that I feel like you shouldn't even have zooming and sniping and doom, but the levels are designed in such a way that there were a lot of opportunities to use it with great effectiveness and it meant that I could stay far away from dangerous demons and not die.

598
00:37:01,331 --> 00:37:02,409
Scott: So I used it.

599
00:37:03,552 --> 00:37:09,788
Rym: So tricks and traps in doom two, one, if you use like doom editors, that was the default map.

600
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:11,289
Rym: They'd throw you in if you just launched the game.

601
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:13,629
Rym: So that's why a lot of people just like specifically remember it.

602
00:37:13,971 --> 00:37:17,290
Rym: But the way that map started is you're in this room and it's octagonal.

603
00:37:17,912 --> 00:37:18,969
Rym: There's eight doors.

604
00:37:19,591 --> 00:37:24,410
Rym: Each door goes to like a tricky place with its own bullshit.

605
00:37:25,333 --> 00:37:27,050
Rym: And that's literally what this game is like.

606
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:30,270
Rym: Like you go into a place and it's got some bullshit you have to deal with.

607
00:37:30,551 --> 00:37:33,730
Rym: Then you go to another place that's separate, that has different bullshit, right?

608
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:39,482
Scott: It's almost like each, they had different people design map pieces and they just sort of stuck them together in a way.

609
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:44,970
Scott: But the thing is, a lot of those pieces are just like a big room.

610
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:47,890
Scott: You're locked in with a whole bunch of demons, kill them all.

611
00:37:48,191 --> 00:37:53,889
Scott: Now it's interesting though, because one thing that doom and especially doom two and it forces you to kill them all, you can't just like run through to the exit.

612
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:55,628
Scott: Like you couldn't do doom two.

613
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:57,488
Rym: Actually this map did that a lot.

614
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:02,330
Rym: A lot of the rooms you went into would lock you in and now you're stuck and you have to kill all the monsters to trigger.

615
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:08,068
Rym: I think it was trigger six, six, six and anyway, there's a trigger in doom because that's how the game work.

616
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:11,350
Rym: You would have triggers that will cause events like do the thing and the door will open.

617
00:38:12,071 --> 00:38:19,089
Rym: One of the triggers is when the last monster in this room dies, does do the thing or when this monster dies, do the thing.

618
00:38:19,892 --> 00:38:22,570
Rym: The whole game is just map 08 of doom two anyway.

619
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:31,310
Scott: So, uh, the bad guys themselves though are a 90% of them are bad guys from old doom games that have been recreated in magnificent fashion.

620
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:33,290
Rym: Like the amps are great.

621
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:38,469
Scott: They're just amps only fancier in 3d and modern and kind of creepy throwing fireballs at you.

622
00:38:39,013 --> 00:38:41,249
Scott: But you can tell they're an imp right away when you look at them.

623
00:38:41,931 --> 00:38:46,466
Scott: There are certain bad guys that were not used very much in old doom that are now used a great deal.

624
00:38:47,435 --> 00:38:48,170
Scott: What's the guy's name?

625
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:51,670
Scott: The big fat guy with like, he's all tech, mancubus.

626
00:38:51,775 --> 00:38:51,950
Scott: Yeah.

627
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:57,348
Scott: Mancubus is like all over this game, even though he was not used very often at all in the old dooms.

628
00:38:57,491 --> 00:38:58,289
Scott: Is there an arch vial?

629
00:38:59,097 --> 00:38:59,668
Scott: Which one's that?

630
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:01,160
Rym: That's the guy who can resurrect people.

631
00:39:01,201 --> 00:39:02,350
Rym: is the wizard with the yellow fire.

632
00:39:03,291 --> 00:39:09,270
Scott: Uh, maybe there's, there's one thing is there's only one spider and one cyber demon, which is disappointing.

633
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:10,248
Rym: Is there a commander keen?

634
00:39:12,031 --> 00:39:18,969
Scott: Uh, maybe there's, there are many barons of hell plant, you know, it's just, uh, the invisible, you know, that's the arch vial.

635
00:39:19,332 --> 00:39:22,570
Scott: No, the invisible demons that just run up to you, right?

636
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:24,010
Scott: You actually don't see those till a bit later.

637
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:29,070
Scott: The pink guys, pinky, the regular old demon is like kind of a dangerous dude in this game.

638
00:39:29,614 --> 00:39:30,830
Scott: Uh, and he doesn't show up till later.

639
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:36,389
Scott: You think he'd show up earlier, but yeah, it's all the guys, you know, uh, one of the thing is the old doom.

640
00:39:36,811 --> 00:39:43,450
Scott: There was Caco demon and there was the other one that there were two different floating balls with eyeballs, right?

641
00:39:44,033 --> 00:39:47,730
Scott: The red one and the fleshy colored one in old doom.

642
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:52,030
Scott: And now there's only one kind, the Caco demon, which is, I guess.

643
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:52,459
Scott: Okay.

644
00:39:52,797 --> 00:39:52,930
Rym: Yeah.

645
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:54,850
Rym: You're thinking of the, Oh, what's the, what's that guy called?

646
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:59,010
Rym: The, uh, there's the fleshy one and there's the red one shoots out the skull guys.

647
00:39:59,411 --> 00:40:04,123
Scott: One of them is the Caco demon and one of them's not pain element, pain elemental is the one that shoots out.

648
00:40:05,252 --> 00:40:09,744
Scott: Pain elemental is not in this game, but there are floating fire skulls that are just on their own.

649
00:40:10,573 --> 00:40:16,730
Scott: Uh, but anyway, it's, you know, each bad guy was great about them is that each one has to be defeated in an interesting way.

650
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:17,129
Scott: It's like, sure.

651
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:25,590
Scott: You could beat any one of the guys just by shooting them a ton and the BFG will kill obviously anything, but each guy has a really efficient way of killing them.

652
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:31,270
Scott: So like to beat pinky, the best thing to do is get behind him and shoot him and he'll go down easy and other guys are going to easy.

653
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:39,230
Scott: We shoot him in the head and other guys would go down easy if you shoot him like, you know, in a certain spot with plasma and other guys would go down easy to a shotgun.

654
00:40:39,391 --> 00:40:41,109
Scott: It's like each guy has an easy way to get them.

655
00:40:42,711 --> 00:40:50,009
Scott: So it's like you have to really, you know, like recognize guys, switch weapons, move and fight each guy.

656
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:55,590
Scott: When there's a bunch of different guys coming at you all mixed up, you have to, you know, get some interesting strategies going on.

657
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:59,389
Scott: Like, well, just dodge that guy, kill that one first, that sort of thing.

658
00:41:00,951 --> 00:41:07,090
Scott: It also has this mechanic where if a guy's hurt a bunch, but not dead yet, oh yeah, you can do the gore thing.

659
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:12,710
Scott: You can push a button to kill them in a gory and I guess melee fashion.

660
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:14,430
Scott: It's a weird jarring experience.

661
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:20,409
Rym: Like you sort of like shoot forward and have this weird gory squeaky like play experience and then you shoot back.

662
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:29,207
Scott: I got an upgrade that increased the range on it, which made it even weirder because like I'd be kind of far away from a guy and I'd push a button and suddenly I'd be like ripping his head off.

663
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:36,430
Rym: Like it's weirdly immersive and jarring, but not as just like, it doesn't mess you up.

664
00:41:36,631 --> 00:41:41,958
Scott: Like you're like normally it's like, I'll just shoot all the guys, but hey, if you do that, you lose an ammo and be.

665
00:41:42,018 --> 00:41:44,210
Scott: when you do this to a guy, you get health and stuff.

666
00:41:44,331 --> 00:41:44,533
Scott: Yeah.

667
00:41:44,694 --> 00:41:46,509
Scott: So it's like you want to do it if you can.

668
00:41:48,352 --> 00:41:52,589
Scott: The other thing is they got the chainsaw, which is a doom classic, but the chainsaw works in a weird way.

669
00:41:53,311 --> 00:41:56,510
Scott: It's not, it doesn't come up when you choose your weapons normally.

670
00:41:57,371 --> 00:42:00,130
Scott: Neither does the BFG, I guess to prevent you from using it by accident.

671
00:42:00,271 --> 00:42:01,055
Scott: Yeah.

672
00:42:01,377 --> 00:42:03,690
Scott: And when you use the chainsaw, you use fuel.

673
00:42:04,371 --> 00:42:05,395
Scott: And what happens?

674
00:42:05,455 --> 00:42:12,530
Scott: if you use the chainsaw on a bad guy, you will kill it in an awesome chainsaw way, no matter what, as long as you have enough fuel for that bad guy.

675
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:15,750
Scott: You, I've even killed like Baron of Hell, a chainsaw, as long as I had a ton of fuel.

676
00:42:16,651 --> 00:42:23,269
Scott: But once you kill a guy with the chainsaw, uh, you get, it just spills a fountain of ammo like everywhere.

677
00:42:23,932 --> 00:42:24,850
Rym: So it's interesting.

678
00:42:25,011 --> 00:42:26,409
Rym: I couldn't figure out how to use the stupid chainsaw.

679
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:28,810
Scott: It has a specific button to bring it out.

680
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:29,031
Rym: Yeah.

681
00:42:29,051 --> 00:42:30,849
Rym: So I picked it up and I was like, oh, I can't select it.

682
00:42:31,071 --> 00:42:33,989
Rym: So then I thought, oh, maybe it's an item like my frag grenade, but then it wasn't.

683
00:42:34,291 --> 00:42:34,331
Scott: No.

684
00:42:34,834 --> 00:42:35,015
Scott: Yeah.

685
00:42:35,056 --> 00:42:37,230
Scott: I didn't use, I barely use a lot of the game.

686
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:40,110
Rym: And until Scott came over to the show tonight, I didn't know how to use the chainsaw.

687
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:41,549
Scott: It has its own button to bring it out.

688
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:42,648
Scott: It's not a regular weapon.

689
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:45,870
Scott: That's why same thing with doing a job of telling me that same thing with BFG.

690
00:42:46,092 --> 00:42:47,450
Scott: No, I had to look it up in the options.

691
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:50,610
Rym: I pointedly, the way I played this game is I decided it's a doom game.

692
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:51,910
Rym: Fuck it balls out.

693
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:54,270
Scott: I'm just going and going and going and going and going and going and going.

694
00:42:54,411 --> 00:42:55,189
Scott: That's what I did too.

695
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:58,389
Scott: Except I also, uh, lingered around and found secrets.

696
00:42:58,952 --> 00:43:02,210
Rym: I found a lot of secrets because it does the thing that doom did.

697
00:43:02,351 --> 00:43:03,910
Rym: That's why it's like the secrets.

698
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:09,410
Scott: The thing is doom was all about secrets, but the secrets in this doom or half-life two style secrets.

699
00:43:09,891 --> 00:43:13,210
Scott: Yeah, but they're not doing that or told the way doom was.

700
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:18,890
Rym: Cause the way doom would have a lot of secrets would be like, you'd see like a glint of a blue armor.

701
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:19,513
Rym: Yup.

702
00:43:19,734 --> 00:43:21,890
Rym: And you'd be like, how the fuck do I get in there?

703
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:22,456
Scott: That's right.

704
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:23,408
Scott: Oh my God.

705
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:24,113
Scott: Yup.

706
00:43:24,458 --> 00:43:25,169
Scott: That's how it does.

707
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:28,210
Rym: But what it doesn't do, at least it hasn't done to me yet.

708
00:43:28,791 --> 00:43:32,530
Rym: Is the classic thing that doom two would do all the time.

709
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:34,915
Rym: It was like a hallmark of game design would be.

710
00:43:35,335 --> 00:43:42,250
Rym: you'd go through an area and that would set up triggers to where on your way back, like shit would happen behind you.

711
00:43:42,854 --> 00:43:44,129
Scott: There's not a lot of backtracking.

712
00:43:44,571 --> 00:43:46,409
Scott: There's maybe some, but not too much.

713
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:52,030
Rym: Like you do a thing and then like behind you, a door silently opens and like four bears out, come out.

714
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:52,478
Rym: Oh my God.

715
00:43:52,519 --> 00:43:53,050
Rym: Like that stuff.

716
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:55,829
Scott: The game does a little bit of that, but not a lot.

717
00:43:56,191 --> 00:43:58,990
Rym: Like I, because I'm doing like, I was obsessed with doom.

718
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:02,790
Rym: Like I got doomed to like memorize, uh, this game.

719
00:44:03,191 --> 00:44:06,004
Rym: I expected a lot of terrifying things to happen.

720
00:44:06,044 --> 00:44:07,310
Rym: that did not happen so far.

721
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:08,609
Scott: Well, have you gone to hell yet?

722
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:10,690
Rym: Well, no, I'm just on Mars still.

723
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:12,109
Scott: It's a little more terrifying in hell.

724
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:12,811
Rym: Yeah.

725
00:44:13,093 --> 00:44:16,010
Rym: But like doom two, that shit started like in level four.

726
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:18,350
Scott: It's not, yeah, it doesn't happen as much.

727
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:21,001
Scott: Uh, also you play it on harder difficulties.

728
00:44:21,041 --> 00:44:22,729
Scott: that happens more, but good luck getting there.

729
00:44:24,533 --> 00:44:26,369
Rym: I'm laying it on a hurt me plenty right now.

730
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:29,510
Rym: I also was hurt plenty, but I'm going to try it in debt.

731
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:31,590
Rym: I think I'm going to like have a decent way through the game.

732
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:36,310
Rym: I might just start over on a ultra violence and see how it goes a little bit of the ultra violence.

733
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:37,592
Scott: Yeah.

734
00:44:38,495 --> 00:44:43,350
Scott: Uh, the other thing that this game has, which other dooms did have, people just didn't pay attention is a plot.

735
00:44:44,552 --> 00:44:47,390
Scott: It's a really thin plot, but it's a doom plot.

736
00:44:47,591 --> 00:44:48,255
Scott: Yeah.

737
00:44:48,678 --> 00:44:50,250
Rym: And it also presents the plot.

738
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:53,790
Scott: The thing is the plot of the original doom was just about as thin.

739
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:55,869
Scott: It just wasn't presented so overtly.

740
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:57,296
Scott: So you would miss it.

741
00:44:57,357 --> 00:44:58,870
Rym: purely environmental storytelling, right?

742
00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:01,156
Scott: It was environmental and also a little bit of text.

743
00:45:01,217 --> 00:45:05,730
Scott: when you started one of the episodes, like the original doom, even do one had a plot.

744
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:18,390
Scott: It's just people didn't know it because they didn't read it and they didn't pay attention and they didn't sort of figure out like, oh, first he's in the base and then he gets overrun and then he goes to hell and then his way out of hell portal open.

745
00:45:18,531 --> 00:45:20,390
Scott: It's like that plot was in the original doom.

746
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:20,751
Scott: It's just.

747
00:45:20,791 --> 00:45:25,869
Scott: you couldn't, you had to like look for it to see it there and fully understand what a dude is like.

748
00:45:26,252 --> 00:45:28,350
Rym: We have play God in this one.

749
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:30,310
Scott: This dude is just telling you the plot.

750
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:44,085
Scott: It's just like everything is just told to you, but it's basically the same plot as the original doom with the obvious exception of, uh, yeah, you're the doom guy brought back for more doom as opposed to you are.

751
00:45:44,145 --> 00:45:48,230
Scott: now, you know, you're just a guy, a space Marine and you are become doom.

752
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:48,710
Scott: Guy,

753
00:45:50,713 --> 00:45:51,994
Rym: but the way

754
00:45:52,014 --> 00:45:52,054
Scott: it

755
00:45:52,775 --> 00:46:07,570
Rym: does that is sort of interesting because it's a little bit deconstructive or a little bit parody in that it'll start to do a half life thing, but like a little casino start, but it'll do it in this almost like desultory fashion and like doom guys.

756
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:14,470
Rym: Response will be to punch the monitor halfway through the dialogue and ended and just continue like that kind of stuff happens a lot.

757
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:15,530
Scott: Doom guy doesn't give a fuck.

758
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:16,909
Scott: He just wants to shoot them demons.

759
00:46:17,171 --> 00:46:19,770
Rym: Like the thing that like lets you upgrade your shit.

760
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:26,790
Rym: The way you interact with it is it starts to like do a thing and you just fucking punch it in the face and pull the upgrade out of it and keep going.

761
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:27,830
Scott: He's just, he's doomed guy.

762
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:28,410
Scott: I didn't give a fuck.

763
00:46:28,592 --> 00:46:29,290
Scott: He's supposed to kill demons.

764
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:29,630
Scott: Yeah.

765
00:46:30,251 --> 00:46:31,224
Scott: Also, it's got a lot of hell.

766
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:32,824
Scott: I'm going to shoot it.

767
00:46:33,392 --> 00:46:35,090
Scott: It was a point at which I don't know if he got there.

768
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:45,350
Scott: I don't remember when it was in the game where the guy who's like the character who just tells you everything, the certain narrator, the cyborg guy, the guy who you're not sure if is good or bad and he's probably both or whatever.

769
00:46:46,052 --> 00:46:48,349
Scott: He's like, Oh, you seem to like guns.

770
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:56,950
Rym: You'll find something to your liking over there, but like you only ever interact with the environment by hitting your use button.

771
00:46:57,290 --> 00:46:57,969
Rym: Very doom style.

772
00:46:58,313 --> 00:46:59,709
Scott: And it just does whatever it's going to do.

773
00:46:59,871 --> 00:47:00,929
Scott: You don't, there's not a lot of choice.

774
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:02,690
Rym: It does it in kind of a funny way.

775
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:09,100
Rym: Like sometimes like here's the switch, it may look different and do a crazy thing, but it is just the switch to continue the plot

776
00:47:09,561 --> 00:47:12,245
Scott: and you might kick it or just touch it or like early

777
00:47:12,265 --> 00:47:15,330
Rym: on in the game you go to the control room and like you see a switch.

778
00:47:15,671 --> 00:47:22,130
Rym: And you hit use on it and it like doesn't do anything, but then there's this dead body like laying next to it and the dead bodies highlighted.

779
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:32,810
Rym: Like you can use it and if you hit use on that doom guy reaches down, holds up the dead guy's arm, shoves it on the control panel and that activates the switch and you don't have to, it's no puzzle.

780
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:40,470
Rym: The puzzle, there's no puzzle to solve there, but it has the trappings of what in another Megaman, Megaman style FPS would have been a puzzle.

781
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:41,168
Scott: Yeah, it has.

782
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:45,089
Scott: It's like, it's not really a puzzle or a maze, but it's like joke.

783
00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:52,270
Scott: It's, it's like there's a lot of parts that like would be amazed, but they didn't make it complex enough where you could actually get lost, right?

784
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:57,010
Scott: It's like, it's like, oh, I'm doing a maze just like original doom games, ha ha ha.

785
00:47:57,150 --> 00:48:00,130
Scott: But it's like, no, actually it's just like two corners.

786
00:48:00,274 --> 00:48:00,848
Scott: There it is.

787
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:03,769
Scott: It's not really a place you're going to get lost in like real doom.

788
00:48:04,153 --> 00:48:04,348
Scott: Sorry.

789
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:06,909
Scott: It's, we didn't make a real maze cause that would take too long.

790
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:12,990
Rym: Yeah, but even then it's still closer to, cause dooms mazes were not really mazes either.

791
00:48:13,091 --> 00:48:15,490
Rym: They were just funneling you through the monster fights.

792
00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:17,190
Scott: Wolfenstein was a maze, right?

793
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:21,650
Scott: Everything got less mazy over time, but this newer doom is the least mazy.

794
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:24,930
Rym: I feel like the old, like Hexen was more mazy, but I don't really remember that clearly.

795
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:30,130
Scott: Not as mazy as Wolfenstein, which was a literal rectangular maze, you get fucking lost.

796
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:37,609
Rym: Well, the doom engines big, like big thing move forward other than the 2.5D was that walls could be at any angle, not just 90 degrees.

797
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:40,150
Scott: I mean, that is one nice part.

798
00:48:40,431 --> 00:48:43,470
Rym: The side deaths or whatever the sectors, the line deaths.

799
00:48:43,811 --> 00:48:44,403
Scott: This is real 3d.

800
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:49,970
Scott: So you got a lot of, you know, interesting ways to hide secrets and maze bits by going up and down.

801
00:48:50,411 --> 00:48:53,761
Scott: And you think, well, it didn't quake do all that, but actually quake.

802
00:48:53,781 --> 00:48:56,990
Scott: single players, garbage compared to old doom or new doom.

803
00:48:57,430 --> 00:49:03,330
Rym: Cause quake and quake two single player were basically, we made a multiplayer game, but there is technically a single player game here.

804
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:05,590
Scott: Here's a bunch of garbage levels you never want to play.

805
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:06,039
Scott: Yup.

806
00:49:07,011 --> 00:49:07,349
Rym: I don't know.

807
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:08,170
Rym: I like this game though.

808
00:49:08,311 --> 00:49:12,249
Rym: Like it's, it's, I don't know if you want to pay full price price for it necessarily.

809
00:49:12,816 --> 00:49:13,090
Scott: Yeah.

810
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:18,190
Scott: I paid full price just because I really wanted to play a single player FPS and it was the best one around.

811
00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:21,630
Rym: But like, it was very telling that I play Overwatch a lot.

812
00:49:21,870 --> 00:49:27,010
Rym: It's and Counter-Strike again, it's very hard to pull me away from those like competitive modern games.

813
00:49:27,611 --> 00:49:31,689
Rym: But then I sat down to play this game to do the show and I just kept playing it.

814
00:49:32,071 --> 00:49:35,510
Rym: Like I just kept playing it the way I would when I was in high school.

815
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:38,790
Rym: I only stopped because I noticed it was like midnight and I had to go to bed.

816
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:47,970
Scott: So it's like, you know, I wouldn't pay the, you know, the 50 bucks or whatever because it's the kind of game where I play, I beat it and I put it on the shelf and I'm done.

817
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:48,378
Scott: Yup.

818
00:49:49,110 --> 00:50:00,290
Scott: But if this comes down in the steam sale, like 20 or less, and you want to, you like single player FPSs and you like doom, you should get this game if your computer can play it.

819
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,420
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

830
00:51:31,201 --> 00:51:32,844
Rym: I didn't have to change anything.

831
00:51:32,944 --> 00:51:35,168
Rym: My mixer is digital.

832
00:51:35,368 --> 00:51:36,591
Rym: The Firewire card worked.

833
00:51:37,412 --> 00:51:41,960
Rym: I literally just took the template from the old computer and used it on the new computer and it seems like it worked.

834
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:48,940
Rym: I'm about to actually edit the episode together so you'll find out in the forum thread if things did not go according to plan.

835
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:57,538
Rym: Stay tuned for a lot of new content now that I can stream episodes live and I can do all sorts of cool nonsense, but now I leave you with something.
