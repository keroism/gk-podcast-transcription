1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,760
Rym: It's Monday, April 4th, 2016.

2
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,281
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,502 --> 00:00:17,982
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight some specific hadoken.

4
00:00:18,346 --> 00:00:21,776
Rym: no That's actually a weird inside joke.

5
00:00:21,837 --> 00:00:25,910
Rym: the show is about HFS plus and case sensitivity.

6
00:00:27,432 --> 00:00:28,447
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:29,912 --> 00:00:33,430
Rym: So as you all know I was at Zenkai con this past weekend doing a bunch of panels.

8
00:00:33,551 --> 00:00:35,969
Rym: It was really fun con, but mistakes are made.

9
00:00:36,511 --> 00:00:39,804
Rym: Yes on the way home because Amtrak's the only way to get to Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

10
00:00:40,025 --> 00:00:44,261
Rym: now if you get there with a car Amtrak's the only way to get to Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

11
00:00:44,301 --> 00:00:45,830
Scott: get there with a helicopter.

12
00:00:46,572 --> 00:00:48,710
Rym: I don't think there's a helipad anywhere in Lancaster.

13
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:50,337
Scott: You could just a big empty field.

14
00:00:50,357 --> 00:00:51,200
Scott: I mean come on and you could.

15
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,876
Scott: you could walk and you could bike there You could motorcycle there.

16
00:00:55,298 --> 00:00:57,710
Scott: so on the way home, and there must be a nearby river.

17
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:58,817
Scott: Can you boat that?

18
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,750
Rym: our only real complaints about Lancaster?

19
00:01:01,091 --> 00:01:03,484
Rym: You know when we would go because this time Scott bailed was just me.

20
00:01:03,524 --> 00:01:04,147
Rym: go to the convention.

21
00:01:04,227 --> 00:01:05,393
Rym: good move One.

22
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:08,926
Rym: there's nothing open on Sunday, so you can't get any food and everything sucks.

23
00:01:09,086 --> 00:01:10,050
Scott: Yeah, it's Jesus town.

24
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:15,685
Scott: Yeah, we're talking Amish Jesus not born-again Jesus, and that is no longer the case.

25
00:01:15,966 --> 00:01:18,510
Rym: weirdly so last year on Sunday There was nothing to eat.

26
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:25,140
Rym: We went to the one restaurant that was open and just like drank beer and had crappy bar The thing only thing that was open on Sunday was like the donut place.

27
00:01:25,863 --> 00:01:30,720
Rym: uh that donut place did not appear to be open I couldn't tell but that tap room was open.

28
00:01:31,202 --> 00:01:32,125
Rym: you remember the tap room.

29
00:01:32,587 --> 00:01:34,755
Scott: Yeah the one with the upstairs Yeah, there's two tap rooms now.

30
00:01:35,056 --> 00:01:35,337
Scott: Okay.

31
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:38,530
Rym: There's two places called the tap room that are very similar.

32
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,630
Scott: Why don't you just call if it's not the same owner?

33
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,679
Scott: Why don't you call one of them like the keg room or something?

34
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:46,294
Rym: one's called the something tap room and someone the other is called The something else tap room.

35
00:01:46,535 --> 00:01:46,976
Scott: uh-huh.

36
00:01:47,177 --> 00:01:49,746
Rym: I just we just call it tap room, but anyway uncreative town.

37
00:01:50,307 --> 00:01:53,844
Rym: so now There were like seven or eight restaurant.

38
00:01:53,884 --> 00:02:02,856
Rym: basically every restaurant That's new is open on Sunday and every restaurant that was already there when we had last visited Lancaster Not open.

39
00:02:02,896 --> 00:02:05,710
Scott: I'm surprised there isn't like an ordinance that they have to be closed on Sunday.

40
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:09,003
Scott: I was you who's in control all the places on Sunday.

41
00:02:09,286 --> 00:02:10,149
Rym: We're super hipster.

42
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,280
Rym: They had basically the same kind of brunch food.

43
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,370
Rym: you get it like sage or LIC market here.

44
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,949
Scott: Just so basically even Lancaster could not escape shitty pot town.

45
00:02:18,301 --> 00:02:27,988
Rym: Yeah And you know what shitty pot town is real great when you have to visit the town For two days and you want somewhere to eat on Sunday, so I actually had a really good brunch.

46
00:02:28,008 --> 00:02:30,457
Rym: look Sunday was fun Sunday was a good day, but then I went home.

47
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:36,650
Rym: You know as you might have seen me tweeting Amtrak Hit somebody like my train hit somebody.

48
00:02:38,251 --> 00:02:40,539
Scott: Now well it hit workers cuz.

49
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:43,970
Rym: no no no no you keep saying that that is not what I said yesterday.

50
00:02:44,178 --> 00:02:46,033
Scott: No No The news is lying.

51
00:02:46,515 --> 00:02:54,610
Rym: an Amtrak train like eight hours before that in the morning Hit a backhoe that was working on the wrong track.

52
00:02:55,051 --> 00:02:55,673
Rym: It was just a bag.

53
00:02:55,714 --> 00:03:01,636
Rym: someone just pulled a backhoe up onto an active Amtrak line and the next train that came hit it And killed everybody involved.

54
00:03:02,058 --> 00:03:04,450
Rym: mm-hmm least everybody in the back up no one in the train.

55
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,378
Scott: So the Amtrak workers were killed.

56
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,450
Rym: I think it was just regular construction workers not Amtrak workers.

57
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:17,650
Rym: But so Amtrak's investigating why the fuck they were just like on the wrong track, but I was like oh crap Maybe I'll get a home.

58
00:03:18,192 --> 00:03:26,259
Rym: Then I look online and Amtrak's like no your trains totally fine because you're coming from the Harrisburg line So we'll bypass the actual derailment.

59
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,001
Rym: all right cool.

60
00:03:27,523 --> 00:03:32,308
Rym: I get on my train at the end of the day and suddenly the train emergency brakes.

61
00:03:33,331 --> 00:03:34,414
Scott: Someone pulled the stupid thing.

62
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:39,310
Rym: no so the train just hit someone on the tracks totally unrelated to that other accident train.

63
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,354
Scott: You were on his train.

64
00:03:40,415 --> 00:03:43,147
Rym: I was on just fucking hit somebody on the same day.

65
00:03:43,448 --> 00:03:49,426
Rym: Yes So I learned a lot about what happens when an Amtrak train hits someone.

66
00:03:49,466 --> 00:03:50,490
Scott: sits there for a while?

67
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:55,869
Rym: No, but I learned about why it sits there for a while because the conductor was a super chill dude.

68
00:03:56,351 --> 00:03:59,041
Rym: And I was talking to him the conductor or the engineer.

69
00:03:59,483 --> 00:04:04,990
Rym: the conductor the engineer was not Around to talk because he had to do something stupid.

70
00:04:05,991 --> 00:04:06,634
Rym: He had to.

71
00:04:06,655 --> 00:04:08,463
Rym: so the train hit a human being.

72
00:04:08,483 --> 00:04:09,689
Scott: killed somebody the train?

73
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:10,412
Rym: no He did.

74
00:04:10,432 --> 00:04:11,616
Rym: so the train hit a human being.

75
00:04:12,058 --> 00:04:13,262
Rym: the guy survived who got hit?

76
00:04:13,302 --> 00:04:15,129
Scott: apparently what stuff Amtrak's go away?

77
00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:20,430
Rym: fat I mean there, but he was severely injured, but he was not dead at that moment, okay?

78
00:04:21,492 --> 00:04:25,790
Rym: The train could have just kept gone on like and left this guy lying there like ambulance.

79
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,236
Rym: I came immediately like they took care of.

80
00:04:27,256 --> 00:04:27,798
Rym: that was fine.

81
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,254
Scott: the train could have just kept going with this bloody smear on the front Pulling into Penn Station.

82
00:04:32,595 --> 00:04:33,578
Rym: Uh yeah, actually they.

83
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,885
Rym: they pulled into Penn Station without cleaning it off,

84
00:04:36,146 --> 00:04:36,607
Scott: okay,

85
00:04:37,069 --> 00:05:03,554
Rym: but The rules that Amtrak has to follow from the federal level are so Ridiculous and overbearing that because the train was involved in any sort of incident at all Basically the engineer Himself had to get off the train and walk the entire length of the train on both sides Inspecting the entire train and sign off on all these pieces of bullshit information along the way Before they could continue.

86
00:05:03,815 --> 00:05:05,782
Rym: the train is over a half mile long.

87
00:05:06,063 --> 00:05:12,042
Rym: it took him a long time to walk all The way around the train and they weren't allowed to leave until he did it.

88
00:05:12,262 --> 00:05:14,570
Scott: couldn't you just like improve this with some technology?

89
00:05:15,212 --> 00:05:17,640
Rym: You can improve the cameras underneath the train.

90
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,228
Rym: improve this Scott in any number of ways.

91
00:05:20,268 --> 00:05:20,990
Scott: a bunch of sensors.

92
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,416
Scott: So like you're on an airplane, right?

93
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:25,147
Rym: It's like yeah, Scott airplanes do manual inspections.

94
00:05:25,288 --> 00:05:25,730
Rym: the same way.

95
00:05:25,911 --> 00:05:28,902
Scott: I know airplanes do manual inspections, but in the cockpit.

96
00:05:28,922 --> 00:05:30,810
Scott: There's a bunch of lights that show you what's working.

97
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,512
Rym: What's that?

98
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:42,050
Rym: - but because it struck something even though it was a soft human who was very unlikely to have caused any damage to To the mighty train could not be defeated by the squishy human.

99
00:05:42,572 --> 00:05:48,636
Rym: Remember the rhinos the Rhino ads in Australia and Melbourne like don't fuck around with the tram you don't is a rhino six rhinos.

100
00:05:50,931 --> 00:06:00,929
Rym: So, uh, yeah the three or whatever hour delay was 90% stupid Amtrak rules and the actual crisis was dealt with almost immediately.

101
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:03,016
Rym: and That was my night.

102
00:06:03,198 --> 00:06:04,990
Scott: How did the ambulance get down into the train track?

103
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:05,474
Rym: I don't know.

104
00:06:05,495 --> 00:06:06,574
Rym: It was right next to a road Like.

105
00:06:06,635 --> 00:06:07,288
Rym: I guess it was easy.

106
00:06:07,551 --> 00:06:12,276
Rym: People were walking up there people were walking up and down like going to the front like knock out the window and see what was going On.

107
00:06:12,337 --> 00:06:16,035
Scott: and yeah, I don't want to go see dead bodies Severely injured bodies.

108
00:06:16,056 --> 00:06:18,750
Rym: Yeah, but apparently this happens kind of often.

109
00:06:19,611 --> 00:06:19,872
Rym: It's called.

110
00:06:19,892 --> 00:06:21,581
Scott: they call you out of the person get it's like it's.

111
00:06:21,741 --> 00:06:23,530
Scott: you know, you can get on to the Metro North tracks.

112
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:26,299
Scott: It's sometimes in most places hard to get on the Amtrak.

113
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:26,881
Rym: No, it's not.

114
00:06:27,282 --> 00:06:27,984
Rym: No, it's not.

115
00:06:28,606 --> 00:06:30,866
Rym: No, no pretty much anywhere I'm they're just there.

116
00:06:31,453 --> 00:06:33,770
Rym: Plus remember the other the step is usually a fence.

117
00:06:33,951 --> 00:06:40,102
Rym: Remember when we were coming back from this go-to party and we saw two separate cars almost get hit by a step to try Is way like the it's on the road.

118
00:06:40,142 --> 00:06:41,310
Scott: you can get near those tracks.

119
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:45,558
Rym: Yeah, so apparently they call you if you want to find out how often this happens.

120
00:06:45,618 --> 00:06:49,963
Rym: It's called a trespasser strike Because one person was trespassing.

121
00:06:50,023 --> 00:07:00,555
Rym: Yes, if you're on the track Truck and apparently trespasser strikes happen all the fuck time and a lot of times and abstract trains just get delayed for a long time It's because of that.

122
00:07:00,856 --> 00:07:02,002
Rym: It's really good.

123
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:03,410
Scott: Why are people going on the tracks?

124
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:13,959
Rym: uh, so the speculation that I heard from people I will not name and imply who they were and seems to be corroborated by a little bit of Cursory follow investigation homeless people.

125
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:15,425
Scott: They just wander on a train.

126
00:07:15,485 --> 00:07:16,248
Rym: It's like 80% homeless people.

127
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:17,916
Scott: Are they trying drunk people?

128
00:07:17,956 --> 00:07:18,780
Scott: Are they trying to die?

129
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,087
Rym: No, they're just following the train tracks.

130
00:07:20,147 --> 00:07:20,590
Rym: No, no better.

131
00:07:21,651 --> 00:07:27,410
Rym: You don't know better than to not go near train tracks Scott because trains are not well known in America to most people.

132
00:07:27,892 --> 00:07:32,510
Rym: You would be surprised how many people just walk on train tracks because they don't have no idea how trains work.

133
00:07:32,811 --> 00:07:34,901
Rym: They assume train tracks they find are abandoned.

134
00:07:35,162 --> 00:07:36,589
Rym: They just don't even think about it.

135
00:07:37,252 --> 00:07:40,223
Scott: So, yeah, yeah, I assume train tracks I find are abandoned.

136
00:07:40,284 --> 00:07:53,530
Rym: if like they're rusted and broken With Amtrak, maybe you might or if I have a map that says rail trail here But the picture the more the other 20% is drunk people who just like walk off an Amtrak platform.

137
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:58,265
Scott: How many taverns tap rooms are right near the train track?

138
00:07:58,325 --> 00:07:59,730
Rym: Amtrak shares a lot of track.

139
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,783
Scott: I feel like you shouldn't give someone a liquor license if they're right near a change.

140
00:08:02,863 --> 00:08:08,434
Rym: Amtrak shares a lot of Train-track area with New Jersey Transit Which you can drink on.

141
00:08:08,976 --> 00:08:13,250
Rym: no, but there's towns near there and drunk drivers are like like when cars get struck.

142
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,844
Rym: It's usually a drunk driver who just like parks on the train tracks.

143
00:08:16,065 --> 00:08:19,329
Rym: when people get by trains It's pretty much always homeless people or drunk people.

144
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:19,953
Scott: This is the ban.

145
00:08:20,013 --> 00:08:23,870
Rym: alcohol suicides appear to be pretty rare actually compared to all those other ones.

146
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:27,885
Rym: So I learned all this last night and I didn't get home till like midnight.

147
00:08:28,246 --> 00:08:29,310
Scott: Oh glad I didn't go there.

148
00:08:29,471 --> 00:08:31,129
Scott: I stayed in New York where everything was good.

149
00:08:32,711 --> 00:08:33,636
Scott: Nice mocha festival.

150
00:08:33,677 --> 00:08:35,467
Scott: nice, you know, it's small but good stuff.

151
00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:44,063
Rym: Yep I will return to Zen kai khan, but if Zen kai khan overlaps with mocha fest again I'm not skipping to mocha fest in a row because I really like mocha fest.

152
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:44,646
Rym: It's okay.

153
00:08:44,967 --> 00:08:47,496
Rym: Yeah We'll talk about mocha fest.

154
00:08:47,516 --> 00:08:48,641
Scott: spent a few hours there went home.

155
00:08:48,801 --> 00:08:49,545
Rym: Yeah, did you get a haul?

156
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:50,549
Rym: some comics will talk about?

157
00:08:50,569 --> 00:08:54,027
Scott: no I just bought one comic with your said this cat on the cover who had a knife in his mouth.

158
00:08:54,087 --> 00:08:54,670
Scott: It was ready to kill.

159
00:08:55,954 --> 00:08:57,229
Rym: Sounds like something you would buy.

160
00:08:58,192 --> 00:09:05,190
Scott: It sounds like something we would both buying but I think I think it was just called like no kitty No, and it's like, you know, the cat just messing stuff up in their apartment.

161
00:09:06,893 --> 00:09:11,280
Rym: So you got any news Technology news that doesn't involve trespasser.

162
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,445
Scott: Well, it's sort of a news.

163
00:09:12,505 --> 00:09:13,470
Scott: It's not even a new news.

164
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:17,750
Scott: It's like a January news, but it's sort of like came to a head at least today for me personally.

165
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:21,361
Scott: So delicious, which is the site that I've been using.

166
00:09:21,381 --> 00:09:23,469
Rym: Oh, yeah used to be de l that I see I owe us.

167
00:09:23,911 --> 00:09:27,028
Scott: It still is de l that I see out of us, but it redirects you to delicious.

168
00:09:27,249 --> 00:09:27,410
Scott: calm.

169
00:09:27,631 --> 00:09:32,766
Scott: Yeah, this is a site that was made in 2003 by a super nerdy guy Joshua something.

170
00:09:32,786 --> 00:09:34,030
Scott: I just remember his name was Josh.

171
00:09:34,271 --> 00:09:35,397
Rym: I think we did a whole episode.

172
00:09:35,457 --> 00:09:37,870
Rym: We use the shit out of this at RIT, right?

173
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:42,645
Scott: So basically what delicious is is cuz you know when you're using the web, right?

174
00:09:42,906 --> 00:09:44,372
Scott: There's two kinds of bookmarks You need.

175
00:09:44,392 --> 00:09:47,330
Scott: there's the bookmark of the site you go to every day, right?

176
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,789
Scott: You just need a fast way to get there.

177
00:09:49,071 --> 00:09:53,850
Scott: It's faster than typing it in even or maybe it is a complicated URL and you don't want to type that in ever.

178
00:09:54,353 --> 00:09:57,410
Scott: Right, like the Amazon Web Services console, right?

179
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,175
Scott: It's like you could be.

180
00:09:58,296 --> 00:10:01,094
Scott: if you're working with Amazon Web Services You might be using that every day.

181
00:10:01,415 --> 00:10:03,402
Scott: the login URL for that is like fuck you.

182
00:10:03,462 --> 00:10:05,790
Scott: It's not like amazon.com slash console, right?

183
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:09,968
Scott: It's some nonsense, especially if you've got to put like your account number in there and shit.

184
00:10:09,988 --> 00:10:10,310
Scott: Fuck that.

185
00:10:10,712 --> 00:10:13,109
Scott: So you use the bookmarks in your browser for that, right?

186
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,981
Scott: But there are some times you just remember URL.

187
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:18,070
Scott: for example, I see a thing of the day on the internet.

188
00:10:18,372 --> 00:10:19,620
Scott: That's not like a YouTube video.

189
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,566
Scott: So I can't just like it.

190
00:10:20,606 --> 00:10:26,990
Scott: to remember it I have to like, you know save that URL somewhere and I don't want to use my browser bookmarks for that.

191
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,114
Scott: That's like a big mess.

192
00:10:28,154 --> 00:10:29,519
Rym: and also browser bookmarks like.

193
00:10:30,021 --> 00:10:33,234
Rym: no one has made a good UX for that in modern era Right, and it's not.

194
00:10:33,254 --> 00:10:34,340
Scott: they're not searchable.

195
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,170
Scott: They're not saved anywhere.

196
00:10:36,512 --> 00:10:38,320
Rym: So do I know you say that but I mean like Chrome.

197
00:10:38,361 --> 00:10:41,678
Rym: syncs it across all my Chrome's like sure But it's not super like.

198
00:10:41,738 --> 00:10:43,709
Scott: it's not convenient for that purpose, right?

199
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:53,225
Scott: 2003 delicious solved this problem with a really simple website where you could just use a bookmark lit Which you'd make a real bookmark out of and any website you're on.

200
00:10:53,265 --> 00:11:03,910
Scott: you could just click that Regular bookmark and it would hit the delicious API and create, you know And save the URL of the page you were on and you could also put a title description and tags.

201
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:04,997
Scott: But it also man the.

202
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,830
Scott: it would automatically fill those in for you.

203
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:10,781
Rym: So think of this an old GeekNights days I had a tag to TD which was things of the day.

204
00:11:11,042 --> 00:11:13,070
Rym: then I had a tag Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday.

205
00:11:13,433 --> 00:11:22,470
Rym: So anytime we had to do a show I'd be like, ah, well I'm gonna talk on a Thursday and I'd go to the URL that was Thursday plus to TD Thursday plus GN news, right?

206
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:23,089
Scott: There was awesome.

207
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,672
Scott: That was the best.

208
00:11:23,752 --> 00:11:28,210
Scott: one of the best features of delicious was that you could find things with multiple tags.

209
00:11:28,632 --> 00:11:38,790
Scott: so like you could just go to like delicious comm slash like music plus Evangelion, right and you could search for things that way like anything has these two tags on it.

210
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:44,910
Scott: You could find stuff there that you couldn't find on Google easily because it was things that human being specifically like wrote down.

211
00:11:45,392 --> 00:11:57,825
Rym: Like man, you did do an episode on delicious on November 14th 2005. yeah, so 2005 night on GeekNights we considered TV OSER over TCP IP Google Analytics.

212
00:11:58,126 --> 00:11:59,409
Rym: Douglas rush coughs new book.

213
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:02,542
Scott: Yeah, that's a rush cough has another new book by the upcoming.

214
00:12:02,603 --> 00:12:03,225
Scott: It's calling.

215
00:12:03,366 --> 00:12:08,278
Rym: It's called throwing rocks The upcoming Xbox 360 launch lineup.

216
00:12:08,699 --> 00:12:12,088
Rym: then we discuss slash shot FARC delicious and dig.

217
00:12:12,108 --> 00:12:13,694
Rym: we called this episode Reading the web.

218
00:12:13,794 --> 00:12:15,000
Scott: All right, so delicious, right?

219
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,004
Scott: We talked about it.

220
00:12:16,024 --> 00:12:17,209
Scott: So I'm talking about lazy show.

221
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,196
Scott: This is was made in 2003.

222
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:20,460
Scott: It was bought by Yahoo.

223
00:12:20,861 --> 00:12:22,627
Scott: then in like by in like 2005 or something, right?

224
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:27,170
Scott: And then in 2011, it was sold to some other company.

225
00:12:27,311 --> 00:12:28,236
Scott: We I think that was a news.

226
00:12:28,296 --> 00:12:32,982
Scott: then only in January of this year It was sold to yet another company.

227
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:46,229
Scott: that company Right, even the previous company didn't do as good a job as even Yahoo or you know, the original developer Yeah But the company that started in January has begun in like the past month or two, right?

228
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,989
Scott: They start, you know, they didn't actually get working until like February March, right?

229
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,196
Scott: Really making delicious bad like.

230
00:12:53,276 --> 00:12:54,259
Scott: oh, sorry.

231
00:12:54,319 --> 00:12:55,001
Rym: I'll go to the list.

232
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,185
Rym: It still does.

233
00:12:56,205 --> 00:12:57,850
Rym: Hey, why do I see all this like?

234
00:12:58,830 --> 00:12:59,981
Rym: Twitter trending bullshit.

235
00:13:00,082 --> 00:13:00,830
Scott: No, I mean that's always bad.

236
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:03,764
Rym: You've been on the front page because I've never been to the front page of delicious before.

237
00:13:03,985 --> 00:13:04,930
Scott: no, you never have.

238
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:19,581
Scott: it's always had stuff like that, but anyway the You know, they just redesigned it more and it's like it still does everything It always did technically speaking but it's been like broken at times or down at times Popular way more ads on it than ever before.

239
00:13:19,601 --> 00:13:31,857
Scott: Yeah popular tags AARP Bible Real estate I mean the point is delicious is sort of like finally Jumped the shark for real like.

240
00:13:31,897 --> 00:13:32,740
Rym: what's wrong with it now?

241
00:13:33,362 --> 00:13:35,609
Scott: I mean you want to keep using that site now.

242
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:40,230
Rym: As far as you told me the site's been like this for a long time.

243
00:13:40,511 --> 00:13:41,154
Scott: No, it's it's.

244
00:13:41,334 --> 00:13:41,696
Scott: I mean this.

245
00:13:41,857 --> 00:13:42,981
Scott: it was bad and now it's.

246
00:13:43,082 --> 00:13:44,970
Scott: it's beyond the pale, right?

247
00:13:45,511 --> 00:13:51,390
Scott: So I switched to the next most popular thing today this morning It only took me like 10 minutes, which is called pin board.

248
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:55,730
Scott: Now the problem with pin board is that a it doesn't look as nice on the website.

249
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:58,250
Scott: The website looks like a Craigslist styling, right?

250
00:13:59,295 --> 00:14:04,728
Scott: successful for a reason but you don't have to go to the website because you can just get like an app on your iPhone or whatever.

251
00:14:04,788 --> 00:14:06,395
Scott: that hits the API and does it that way.

252
00:14:06,877 --> 00:14:08,263
Scott: so pin board is not free.

253
00:14:08,303 --> 00:14:09,006
Scott: It costs money.

254
00:14:09,026 --> 00:14:15,502
Scott: Ooh It's like $11 or whatever A year, it's got flicker style pricing.

255
00:14:15,542 --> 00:14:21,384
Scott: but for $25 a year You can get this super pin board, which basically does everything delicious did.

256
00:14:21,845 --> 00:14:23,010
Scott: only there's no ads ever.

257
00:14:23,814 --> 00:14:26,790
Scott: And it's super fast like it's performance is like their goal.

258
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:27,434
Scott: It's way fast.

259
00:14:27,896 --> 00:14:31,853
Rym: if there was a Twitter that just cost 25 bucks a year Yeah, I know right.

260
00:14:32,274 --> 00:14:36,025
Scott: So anyway, it's super fast and it does everything delicious did.

261
00:14:36,065 --> 00:14:40,781
Scott: but if you buy this super version for $25 a year, what could it possibly do for me?

262
00:14:41,002 --> 00:14:43,110
Scott: It has this amazing feature that delicious did not have.

263
00:14:43,331 --> 00:14:44,900
Rym: What does it find things of the day for me?

264
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,644
Rym: It tells me what to do.

265
00:14:45,664 --> 00:14:46,368
Rym: GeekNights on.

266
00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:49,309
Scott: no What it does is it's archive mode.

267
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:56,750
Scott: So anything anything you bookmark it will actually take a download a copy of that page and save it.

268
00:14:57,072 --> 00:15:14,830
Scott: so if like you but if you make a pin of Some like article and then you delete that article or edit that article or mess with that article or becomes 404 you can go to your pin board and click on this button and see the permanently saved version of that site that you Bookmarked.

269
00:15:17,391 --> 00:15:22,450
Scott: Whereas I'm delicious, you know, I loaded my delicious backup into pin board and it didn't take very long at all.

270
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,541
Scott: It totally worked perfect everything everything broken.

271
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:34,425
Scott: Yeah, all the old old links Most of them don't work but pin board even if you export from pin board like all the data They give you all those backups - it's like those are?

272
00:15:34,445 --> 00:15:35,510
Scott: you know, those are yours you're paying.

273
00:15:35,712 --> 00:15:40,490
Scott: So it's like if you want to leave pin board Well, you can download all those cached versions of web pages.

274
00:15:40,891 --> 00:15:45,044
Scott: The only caveat is it's a 32 megabyte limit per bookmark.

275
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:48,461
Scott: So if you like bookmark a YouTube video You're not getting the YouTube video.

276
00:15:48,925 --> 00:15:56,890
Scott: Yeah Okay, and if there's like a giant giant JPEG that's a whole bunch of them like a big photo gallery and they're all full-size.

277
00:15:57,472 --> 00:15:59,702
Scott: You're not getting us warning 1.4 megabytes.

278
00:15:59,742 --> 00:16:00,566
Rym: download with care.

279
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:05,558
Rym: Yeah So There is a fork.

280
00:16:05,859 --> 00:16:07,085
Rym: This is just kind of a weird.

281
00:16:07,105 --> 00:16:17,830
Rym: so in the road I've been thinking about this idea a lot because someone pointed out very very poignantly that Soylent is just ultra slim fast.

282
00:16:18,452 --> 00:16:22,809
Rym: But tech bros pretend that they invented it and they market it at men pretty much.

283
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:31,020
Rym: Yeah Yeah Also, they make it in shoddy dangerous labs and with no oversight and it's sort of a we're surprised The FDA hasn't and looked into it yet.

284
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,430
Scott: I suspect selling it is food.

285
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:35,555
Rym: Yeah, I suspected so.

286
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:37,944
Scott: in the United States the FDA will look into it.

287
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:39,128
Scott: I'm surprised but why did they?

288
00:16:39,148 --> 00:16:41,495
Scott: why were they able to Sell it before the FDA like tint.

289
00:16:41,836 --> 00:16:43,200
Rym: I don't know we should.

290
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,630
Rym: we should find someone who can tell us how Soylent is not gone.

291
00:16:46,992 --> 00:16:49,063
Scott: Do I know a person I could ask about?

292
00:16:49,485 --> 00:16:53,322
Rym: we do perhaps What that person's opinion is but this

293
00:16:53,342 --> 00:16:55,210
Scott: I never thought to ask that person about this particular

294
00:16:55,692 --> 00:17:09,349
Rym: ideas like fake food or vet meat or everything, but when it comes to fake flavor Like Americans like to drink garbage soda the candy water But and they've ruined their sense of taste so much that they don't want to drink anything but candy water most of the time.

295
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:12,020
Scott: I don't drink any and they need to constantly drink candy water.

296
00:17:12,561 --> 00:17:17,579
Scott: So actually even drinking less juice than I drink before Yeah, I drink mostly water and seltzer.

297
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,483
Rym: Well coffee.

298
00:17:18,703 --> 00:17:20,490
Scott: I'm only getting the high cloud on drink coffee either.

299
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:21,521
Rym: Why coffee is good for you?

300
00:17:21,664 --> 00:17:23,556
Scott: No, okay That's what they want you to believe.

301
00:17:23,737 --> 00:17:26,750
Rym: actually pretty much every study says they paid for by coffee industry.

302
00:17:27,031 --> 00:17:37,961
Rym: No, but there's a lot of evidence actually that moderate to high intake of coffee Has a pretty strong correlation with not getting Alzheimer's sure Or at least not getting dementia in a general sense.

303
00:17:38,001 --> 00:17:39,307
Rym: I don't know if it's Alzheimer's specifically.

304
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:39,728
Rym: Uh-huh.

305
00:17:39,849 --> 00:17:43,089
Scott: Yeah Okay, and all the you know, just keep you know, justifying your poison.

306
00:17:44,451 --> 00:17:45,074
Rym: What about water?

307
00:17:45,114 --> 00:17:47,422
Rym: I mean with Flint, you know, you never know.

308
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:48,888
Scott: I'm drinking New York water.

309
00:17:49,089 --> 00:17:53,587
Scott: Yeah We should test our water and see you can get a free water test to call through on one.

310
00:17:53,607 --> 00:17:54,150
Scott: They'll send you one.

311
00:17:54,411 --> 00:18:02,650
Rym: So but we invented to deal with this problem Fake sugar which you know, like people don't think a lot about diet soda.

312
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:09,470
Rym: But when you really think about it, we design chemicals that taste like things our body wants but yet are indigestible.

313
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,177
Rym: It's like we're drinking sawdust.

314
00:18:11,498 --> 00:18:14,370
Scott: Oh, you can just use MSG, which is actually totally okay for you.

315
00:18:14,651 --> 00:18:18,130
Rym: Oh, yeah, but it's a similar but that's a flavor that the body also will process.

316
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:20,790
Rym: It's just not super caloric or I don't know if it's even caloric at all.

317
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:25,570
Rym: I don't think it's cool might be a little caloric and you'd be surprised what things are at least moderately caloric.

318
00:18:25,831 --> 00:18:27,397
Scott: It just makes things taste savory.

319
00:18:27,497 --> 00:18:27,839
Rym: I just got.

320
00:18:27,939 --> 00:18:30,750
Rym: uh, how many calories do you think are in like a shot of vodka?

321
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,635
Rym: Vodka yeah, or like grain.

322
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:37,304
Scott: Oh, I mean, there's no calories in the alcohol part.

323
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,146
Scott: Yeah, there are.

324
00:18:38,266 --> 00:18:40,675
Scott: it's only the nutrition It's only the potato part.

325
00:18:40,736 --> 00:18:42,122
Rym: No, it's the alcohol part.

326
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:48,088
Scott: Alcohol is nutrient is nutritive but that's not something that like you're what I mean, it's just your liver does that?

327
00:18:48,108 --> 00:18:48,430
Scott: not your?

328
00:18:49,073 --> 00:18:51,970
Scott: It's not something like you would digest and absorb in your intestines.

329
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:56,289
Scott: It's like it goes into the liver and then the liver enzymes break up the outer sky.

330
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,974
Scott: That's not giving you any calories.

331
00:18:58,114 --> 00:19:01,403
Rym: one ounce of vodka 64 motherfucking calories.

332
00:19:01,984 --> 00:19:03,087
Scott: That's all the potato part.

333
00:19:03,569 --> 00:19:07,403
Scott: No It's not I don't understand.

334
00:19:07,423 --> 00:19:08,890
Scott: This doesn't make any sense.

335
00:19:09,131 --> 00:19:13,544
Scott: Anyway, chemically speaking so it can't be just the ethanol if you just drink how many shots.

336
00:19:13,584 --> 00:19:15,490
Scott: so how many calories are in a shot?

337
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:16,603
Scott: Of like Everclear 200 proof.

338
00:19:18,212 --> 00:19:19,678
Rym: I'll type it in around ethanol.

339
00:19:20,241 --> 00:19:22,149
Scott: Yeah, it's got to be zero, right?

340
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:30,730
Scott: You get to tell you could spell it properly Seven calories per gram of pure ethanol.

341
00:19:31,811 --> 00:19:32,795
Scott: Where does it come from?

342
00:19:33,156 --> 00:19:35,383
Rym: The what is ethanol Scott?

343
00:19:35,403 --> 00:19:36,447
Scott: It's just alcohol.

344
00:19:36,888 --> 00:19:39,208
Rym: Yeah we anyway.

345
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:42,490
Rym: Anyway.

346
00:19:43,502 --> 00:19:47,720
Rym: so We're also the people who invented a Lester.

347
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,543
Rym: do you remember Alestra?

348
00:19:48,844 --> 00:19:50,410
Scott: Yeah, didn't that make people like have diarrhea?

349
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:51,535
Rym: Yeah, so it wasn't.

350
00:19:51,575 --> 00:19:55,097
Rym: so the deal with Alestra is that it was a fat But it was like it was just like.

351
00:19:55,238 --> 00:19:56,565
Scott: it was a fad that didn't break down.

352
00:19:56,605 --> 00:19:57,530
Scott: So it went straight through you.

353
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,335
Rym: It was a fat.

354
00:19:58,355 --> 00:20:00,650
Rym: So you taste your nice fatty nonsense.

355
00:20:00,911 --> 00:20:04,266
Rym: But it just went straight through right through your body like a tube and just come out the other end.

356
00:20:04,327 --> 00:20:05,070
Scott: that is greasy.

357
00:20:05,191 --> 00:20:06,790
Scott: So it made your shit mad greasy.

358
00:20:06,891 --> 00:20:09,870
Rym: So I was reading actually about Alestra a couple days ago.

359
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:12,001
Scott: And also you didn't get your necessary intake of fat.

360
00:20:12,042 --> 00:20:13,027
Scott: if you just ate that shit.

361
00:20:13,127 --> 00:20:19,469
Rym: even worse it might have actually caused other nutrients to leach out of your body and oh, yeah, because other food is gonna slip right out like a.

362
00:20:22,391 --> 00:20:27,146
Scott: It's like food that would have stayed in the intestine and gotten digested and absorbed instead right out.

363
00:20:27,688 --> 00:20:31,541
Rym: so The only reason it caused all that like.

364
00:20:31,581 --> 00:20:39,110
Scott: it's like you're not gonna get too much nutrition If even if you eat like a salads all day and like the most delicious best salads if you're also eating x-lax, right?

365
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:39,719
Scott: it's not gonna help.

366
00:20:40,186 --> 00:20:59,753
Rym: so Basically Alestra wouldn't have been this problem that it ended up being Except for the fact that the people who were using Alestra chips like they'd eat Alestra chips because I don't want to get fat They would eat so many more chips than anyone even reasonably think the human would consume That.

367
00:20:59,793 --> 00:21:01,402
Rym: that is why they're having such a problem.

368
00:21:01,422 --> 00:21:02,790
Rym: They're busy ODing on a lot.

369
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,639
Scott: So that's how they got on the shelves to begin with.

370
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:13,287
Rym: cuz yeah people tested them tested a reason What human being will buy an entire extra large bag of chips and eat all of them in one sitting?

371
00:21:13,307 --> 00:21:17,527
Scott: and apparently the ones that Are really fat, which are the ones that are Alestra, right?

372
00:21:17,587 --> 00:21:19,054
Rym: Yep Exactly.

373
00:21:19,395 --> 00:21:21,765
Rym: Here is a. I never imagined that this would be.

374
00:21:21,806 --> 00:21:22,810
Rym: yet a third way to go.

375
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,496
Rym: This is edging into.

376
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:26,282
Rym: this is one step away from.

377
00:21:26,584 --> 00:21:28,370
Rym: why don't we just put a chip in your brain that makes you taste?

378
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,689
Rym: Whatever we want you to taste?

379
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:31,051
Scott: Okay.

380
00:21:31,072 --> 00:21:32,196
Rym: Yeah, cuz you could do that.

381
00:21:32,216 --> 00:21:32,677
Scott: Take that.

382
00:21:32,878 --> 00:21:34,504
Scott: Yeah, then I could save a lot of fucking money.

383
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,010
Rym: I'll hack it and poop taste.

384
00:21:37,153 --> 00:21:38,629
Rym: Send me a Bitcoin or poop taste.

385
00:21:40,311 --> 00:21:41,937
Scott: Well, I mean you can make a great.

386
00:21:41,957 --> 00:21:45,190
Scott: you can go to restaurant websites and taste their food before going to the restaurant.

387
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:46,093
Rym: Yeah, and then I hacked it.

388
00:21:46,113 --> 00:21:49,004
Rym: you trust a restaurant's websites not get hacked with poop taste.

389
00:21:49,305 --> 00:21:50,550
Scott: No, I'm gonna hack all the restaurants.

390
00:21:51,836 --> 00:21:55,150
Rym: Remember the time at RIT when we printed goats eat all those printers just kind of randomly.

391
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:57,290
Rym: It's gonna be that but with poop in your mouth.

392
00:21:57,551 --> 00:22:02,405
Scott: Did you see that the the asshole weave guy sent like he printed things?

393
00:22:02,445 --> 00:22:08,310
Scott: are all that racist nonsense Nonsense around like every open printer he could find in the US or whatever?

394
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:11,058
Rym: Yeah, fun fact guys, uh, if you just use Google, right?

395
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:16,078
Rym: There are so many unencrypted public webcams of stuff You probably don't want to watch.

396
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,690
Scott: No, there's a. I think there's a site.

397
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:21,750
Scott: It's like a. it's like a roulette like you just click next and it finds a webcam and you watch it.

398
00:22:21,972 --> 00:22:24,170
Rym: I was playing with a site like that at work the other day and you know what?

399
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:25,515
Rym: I mostly found video of.

400
00:22:25,535 --> 00:22:29,410
Rym: it was cameras pointed at pumps in factories.

401
00:22:29,892 --> 00:22:30,496
Scott: There's a lot of those.

402
00:22:30,536 --> 00:22:31,522
Rym: so I guess there's a pump breaks.

403
00:22:31,542 --> 00:22:33,010
Rym: you'd be like, well, I guess that's the one that's broken.

404
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,176
Scott: I've worked I've worked.

405
00:22:34,297 --> 00:22:36,750
Scott: I'm like pump monitoring, you know stuff.

406
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:41,070
Scott: It's like that's a big deal because like in factories like the pumps are the things that need the most looking at right?

407
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:48,910
Scott: Yeah, they're constantly have a moving parts You know, they need to be lubricated and powered and that's all you know, if you're in a factory That's like mostly doing its own thing.

408
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:52,704
Scott: I think the one we were working for was like a corn syrup place, right and it's like.

409
00:22:53,066 --> 00:22:54,230
Scott: that's the most important part.

410
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,356
Scott: Everything else is like tanks.

411
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:57,166
Scott: You don't really it's like there's a tank.

412
00:22:57,186 --> 00:22:57,910
Scott: have a leak or not?

413
00:22:57,991 --> 00:22:59,509
Scott: If it does we'll find out pretty quick.

414
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:04,128
Scott: So they needed all kinds of stuff like monitor the temperature and the vibration and all this.

415
00:23:04,651 --> 00:23:07,330
Scott: You know all kinds of things on all pumps most of the IT work.

416
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:12,772
Rym: I was doing an IBM like on that factory and the fab was not to add to the things that are actually directly making the Chips.

417
00:23:13,054 --> 00:23:15,370
Rym: it was monitoring all the parts of the process.

418
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:25,030
Rym: So you detect if like a pump broke or like something weird happened somewhere or or usually like yields go down like well Why and then you have to look into the whole system to figure out what changed?

419
00:23:26,051 --> 00:23:31,190
Rym: This is a fork that uses varying frequency electric currents.

420
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:39,090
Rym: So when it touches your tongue, you can it can give you a a basically like a binary of salty tasting and sour tasting.

421
00:23:39,593 --> 00:23:40,859
Scott: So the fork is pretty limited.

422
00:23:40,899 --> 00:23:41,925
Scott: It can't be poop taste.

423
00:23:42,025 --> 00:23:44,030
Scott: It's not poop taste yet It can't do any taste.

424
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:45,415
Scott: It can only do this all.

425
00:23:45,435 --> 00:23:49,430
Rym: it's pretty much as current on off if you use it to and level I think frequency.

426
00:23:49,532 --> 00:23:50,550
Rym: I didn't read the whole paper.

427
00:23:50,912 --> 00:23:54,529
Rym: So it gives a salty taste because right like already think about how useful that is.

428
00:23:54,871 --> 00:24:04,677
Rym: So people who have heart issues where maybe they need to really cut their salt intake As much as you should not eat a lot of salt You should still eat some salt.

429
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:08,110
Scott: Yeah, but a lot of people like try to avoid salt too much and that's also bad.

430
00:24:08,231 --> 00:24:10,729
Rym: Well, you probably should because all our food is way too much salt in it.

431
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:16,588
Rym: So well, I mean if you try to avoid a hundred percent salt You'll probably take enough salt in to be okay anyway, right?

432
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,590
Scott: But I mean first of all, you got to get the IO died.

433
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:18,750
Scott: right.

434
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:21,461
Scott: the thing is people are always thinking about when they think about salt.

435
00:24:21,722 --> 00:24:29,327
Scott: they think about the salt like when they're shaking salt on the Food and it's like that's actually like if you shake salt on the food as much as blue apron tells you to.

436
00:24:29,688 --> 00:24:31,334
Scott: that's actually not That much salt, right?

437
00:24:31,535 --> 00:24:35,350
Scott: But if you eat like a bag of potato chips, yeah, that's way too much salt.

438
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:38,950
Scott: Yeah, the salt that's like in food you buy that's already made is too much.

439
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:45,450
Rym: I think about this say you want to eat your awesome salty dish, but you're not allowed to eat salt because of medical condition.

440
00:24:46,012 --> 00:24:49,689
Rym: This would basically make your food taste salty if you use this fork to eat it.

441
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:51,176
Scott: Sure, and it doesn't there's.

442
00:24:51,216 --> 00:24:54,370
Scott: no it's not even like a Lester where you're taking in something into your body.

443
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:55,970
Scott: You're just not you're just tickling the tongue.

444
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,255
Rym: Oh, so that that's why I was.

445
00:24:57,476 --> 00:25:00,629
Rym: the reason I brought this up is when it came to a Lester and diet cola.

446
00:25:01,211 --> 00:25:05,223
Rym: They feel vaguely disgusting to me because it feels like we're like.

447
00:25:05,263 --> 00:25:15,716
Rym: it feels like this weird subversion of our bodies Desires like we trained ourselves to like something bad and then we make a bad thing to consume so we can continue to experience that Sensation.

448
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:21,456
Rym: this is just VR This Thing this fork it's just VR.

449
00:25:21,476 --> 00:25:21,737
Rym: It's just.

450
00:25:21,898 --> 00:25:32,601
Rym: it's not sight or sound it's just tongue Kinda, well, no, it's AR because you're not just gonna like carry it around in your mouth You're gonna use it to augment the food you're eating.

451
00:25:32,621 --> 00:25:40,290
Rym: So this is AR not VR This topic here, but there's room for debate.

452
00:25:41,392 --> 00:25:43,345
Scott: That whole point is I don't need the salt version.

453
00:25:43,385 --> 00:25:44,170
Scott: eat the sugar version.

454
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:47,400
Scott: That would also a lot more people have diabetes.

455
00:25:47,682 --> 00:25:49,650
Rym: no, I need these sugar cookie version.

456
00:25:50,291 --> 00:25:50,552
Rym: It's just.

457
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:52,543
Rym: I put it in my mouth and I taste sugar cookie.

458
00:25:52,623 --> 00:25:53,709
Scott: I'm hacking that with poop days.

459
00:25:55,831 --> 00:26:04,490
Scott: Now, you know that'd be the greatest like if I could somehow get it to her like Like this cookies and if you steal them, they taste like poop, but if I eat them, it tastes like DRM on the cookies.

460
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,535
Scott: That's right.

461
00:26:05,575 --> 00:26:07,464
Rym: Wasn't there that company that's claiming they're gonna?

462
00:26:07,726 --> 00:26:11,561
Rym: if you pirate stuff They're gonna hack into your computer and like take it for ransom.

463
00:26:12,143 --> 00:26:12,363
Scott: cool.

464
00:26:12,705 --> 00:26:14,150
Rym: Yeah, we'll see how that goes down.

465
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:15,749
Scott: Go for it.

466
00:26:17,093 --> 00:26:17,315
Rym: It's like.

467
00:26:17,335 --> 00:26:24,670
Rym: I want other news because this will affect Our listener more so than most people because this only affects insufferable pedants.

468
00:26:25,372 --> 00:26:34,720
Rym: The AP style guide has decided that the word Internet and the word web and the World Wide Web No longer deserving of capitalization in modern usage.

469
00:26:34,821 --> 00:26:38,150
Scott: Okay, I agree that World Wide Web should not be capitalized.

470
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:38,756
Scott: Well, because I don't.

471
00:26:38,816 --> 00:26:40,129
Scott: the World Wide Web is not a thing.

472
00:26:40,574 --> 00:26:48,360
Rym: I agree with that but I want to qualify that by saying that the World Wide Web was a thing and We killed it and it no longer exists.

473
00:26:48,381 --> 00:26:49,990
Scott: It was never a thing right thing.

474
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:57,412
Rym: All you're doing right is it and there was a time when the internet was just a collection of static web pages that were hyperlinked To one another.

475
00:26:57,633 --> 00:26:59,038
Scott: that's not true at all.

476
00:26:59,379 --> 00:27:01,546
Scott: In fact, the web came way after the internet started.

477
00:27:01,566 --> 00:27:04,679
Scott: Yeah the internet That's the problem as a consumer internet.

478
00:27:04,699 --> 00:27:05,583
Rym: You want to get pedantic?

479
00:27:05,603 --> 00:27:06,045
Rym: Let's go.

480
00:27:06,146 --> 00:27:07,130
Scott: No, that's not true at all.

481
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:11,708
Scott: In fact the shit like prodigy for it came out for consumers way before the.

482
00:27:11,909 --> 00:27:14,790
Rym: you know HTTP and the World Wide Web was a revolution beyond that.

483
00:27:14,979 --> 00:27:16,857
Scott: No the World Wide Web is not even a thing is this?

484
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:20,694
Scott: and the problem is the fact that people created the term World Wide Web to Refer to.

485
00:27:20,714 --> 00:27:29,888
Scott: you know web browsers and HTTP Made people think that the entire internet was HTTP and web browsers and that they don't realize like oh like.

486
00:27:30,369 --> 00:27:34,810
Scott: well Well, it gives all these other protocols for communicating over the internet.

487
00:27:36,073 --> 00:27:42,210
Rym: Most people thought that was that that was right as the growth of people accessing internet technology was skyrocketing.

488
00:27:42,351 --> 00:27:52,007
Rym: So the like pretty much within a year of the World Wide Web existing in any practical sense Probably the majority of people using the internet in any way had only ever experienced it.

489
00:27:52,609 --> 00:27:56,690
Scott: anyway I disagree that internet should not be capitalized.

490
00:27:56,710 --> 00:28:12,371
Scott: See if the internet is a thing and if you want to give a like if you want to say that like Chicago should be capitalized with a capital C then Then the internet as in the one and only big internet that the whole world is connected to should be capitalized with a capital I.

491
00:28:12,411 --> 00:28:15,401
Rym: so they pointed out that the reason for this is that very few people like.

492
00:28:15,702 --> 00:28:18,653
Rym: the word internet is used most often without the Definite article.

493
00:28:19,014 --> 00:28:23,248
Rym: it's used as a descriptor like an internet blah, then you should definitely lowercase it.

494
00:28:23,308 --> 00:28:32,529
Rym: in that case Yeah, and I I will do that, but I agree with you I will continue to get right if you want to when you're referring to it as the place where my culture lives.

495
00:28:32,891 --> 00:28:41,810
Scott: Right, if you want to talk about the internet as in the one then you need to use a capital I. But you know if you want to talk about yeah, you know on internet, right?

496
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:48,069
Scott: Well, I think internet has an adjective like, you know as something as we discussed before we started recording the show.

497
00:28:48,714 --> 00:28:58,954
Rym: No, well actually no, you know No one ever you no one ever in the modern era like for decades has actually said internet to mean Networks that were connected.

498
00:28:59,034 --> 00:29:05,010
Rym: okay there that are not on the internet the word intranet ended up encompassing everything that's not on the internet.

499
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:09,603
Scott: Yeah, people people use the word intranet to describe internets when they shouldn't.

500
00:29:09,663 --> 00:29:11,990
Rym: yes, cuz intranet now just means private network.

501
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:12,453
Scott: But you know what?

502
00:29:12,534 --> 00:29:13,279
Scott: I'm gonna disagree.

503
00:29:13,339 --> 00:29:20,574
Scott: I think if you're talking about say An internet protocol right for example, yeah Well, you wouldn't.

504
00:29:20,654 --> 00:29:32,817
Rym: you don't capitalize highway system protocol the highway systems not capitalized That's true, but if you're over but interstate I think is well You're thinking about the wrong thing.

505
00:29:33,078 --> 00:29:42,676
Scott: if someone writes New York bagel you don't Uncapitalized New York because it's being used as an adjective Chicago pizza, which isn't pizza.

506
00:29:42,756 --> 00:29:45,544
Scott: Otherwise, it would just be called pizza and not Chicago pizza.

507
00:29:45,885 --> 00:29:47,390
Scott: You still capitalize Chicago.

508
00:29:48,354 --> 00:29:51,608
Scott: Whoo, there's a you want to write, you know Turkish citizen.

509
00:29:51,648 --> 00:29:55,183
Scott: You don't Uncapitalized Turkish, ah, but what?

510
00:29:55,203 --> 00:29:59,762
Rym: as much as I'd like this to be true We can't actually live in internet yet and it's not a sovereign nation.

511
00:29:59,782 --> 00:30:01,106
Scott: It doesn't mean anything.

512
00:30:01,126 --> 00:30:02,150
Scott: It's still a proper noun.

513
00:30:02,251 --> 00:30:05,488
Scott: It is a specific one and only thing and not one of met.

514
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,061
Scott: You know, it's like when you talk about a pie.

515
00:30:08,121 --> 00:30:15,030
Rym: so Scott as long as I can tell you style guides You have to capitalize the word interstate because it refers to the interstate road system in the United States.

516
00:30:15,492 --> 00:30:16,878
Rym: So if interstates capitalize,

517
00:30:16,938 --> 00:30:20,912
Scott: I think if you're talking about the interstate but not on Interstates, but

518
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:28,934
Rym: no one uses that terminology and if you refer to a specific road like i-10 you have to say interstate 10 Capitalized I

519
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:36,097
Scott: well, but if you were gonna talk about like a Rym right not the Rym But a Rym would you uncapitalized Rym in that case?

520
00:30:36,318 --> 00:30:36,739
Rym: in that case?

521
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:40,833
Rym: Yeah, I would I don't know except there's no generic case For please.

522
00:30:41,054 --> 00:30:42,299
Scott: I'm just saying the AP got it wrong.

523
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:42,941
Scott: That's all I'm saying.

524
00:30:42,961 --> 00:30:44,929
Scott: They're trying to disrespect internet.

525
00:30:46,392 --> 00:30:48,761
Scott: We should we should uncapitalize AP just be like app.

526
00:30:49,364 --> 00:30:56,096
Rym: there are a lot of deleted Wikipedia articles and Arguments about the deletion of what.

527
00:30:56,116 --> 00:30:59,609
Scott: could be someone trying to go around all of Wikipedia uncapitalizing internet?

528
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:00,348
Scott: now They're there.

529
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:05,947
Rym: So the category was interstate highways in Alabama and apparently there was there.

530
00:31:05,987 --> 00:31:09,690
Rym: someone was trying to make a page interstate highways in every state.

531
00:31:11,493 --> 00:31:13,770
Scott: Why don't they just make the interstate highway system page?

532
00:31:15,871 --> 00:31:17,943
Scott: I just split up the states.

533
00:31:18,144 --> 00:31:24,547
Rym: I just found a Fascinating world that I do not want to step too much deeper in because I'm gonna read these pages all night.

534
00:31:24,687 --> 00:31:29,506
Scott: every Wikipedia Article has something like this if you just click on the discussion tab talk tab.

535
00:31:29,546 --> 00:31:30,630
Scott: That's why I don't click on that shit.

536
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:31,212
Rym: Yeah, go for it.

537
00:31:31,232 --> 00:31:36,330
Rym: There's clearly no consensus in the use of uppercase H. That's what H. Why are they talking for highway?

538
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:39,219
Rym: Yeah, yeah highway is not capitalized.

539
00:31:39,259 --> 00:31:41,267
Rym: There's some people here really wanted to be capitalized.

540
00:31:41,287 --> 00:31:42,150
Rym: their arguments are stupid.

541
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:55,660
Scott: well if I was talking about for example the Scott-rubin highway you would capitalize highway, but if you're talking about a highway like I'll take the highway Even though it's high road in that song, but you would You already undermine your own argument.

542
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,330
Scott: I'm just saying I'm gonna take a ride on the highway.

543
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:11,560
Rym: I would lowercase highway in that sense, but I guess the the useful categories today are intranet Internet is the Internet and then extranet is just basically like Basically replaced lands except they're private.

544
00:32:12,102 --> 00:32:13,950
Rym: They're only really used by enterprise companies.

545
00:32:14,392 --> 00:32:16,279
Scott: They're really just intranets.

546
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:26,269
Scott: when a company has multiple canvases or Between companies like a bunch of companies will like if you're in the Google office in New York You need to be able to connect on the same network to the Google office in California.

547
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:30,610
Rym: That's just a. when an extranet is more like say Google Amazon Yahoo!

548
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:33,670
Rym: And ten other companies said we need to all communicate with each other.

549
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,039
Scott: Yeah, you know what everyone uses for that.

550
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:38,197
Scott: just eat the Internet Yeah, but well no.

551
00:32:38,578 --> 00:32:41,410
Rym: so finance and there are a bunch of other industries.

552
00:32:41,711 --> 00:32:47,710
Rym: They use extranets where they sort of all agree and just directly connect infrastructure to each other and make their own internet.

553
00:32:48,612 --> 00:32:51,809
Scott: I mean do they do this like in a single data center, or is like Verizon helping them out?

554
00:32:52,331 --> 00:32:55,490
Rym: They do it across data centers, and they work with multiple vendors to make it happen.

555
00:32:55,650 --> 00:33:02,755
Rym: But the idea is you can connect through these networks to other people in a semi-public fashion within the network With varying levels of security.

556
00:33:02,775 --> 00:33:03,919
Scott: Does it have its own DNS?

557
00:33:03,999 --> 00:33:06,207
Rym: It's basically an invite only private internet.

558
00:33:06,248 --> 00:33:06,830
Scott: Does it use IP?

559
00:33:08,531 --> 00:33:09,721
Scott: Basically, yeah.

560
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:10,710
Scott: Did they have their own DNS?

561
00:33:12,591 --> 00:33:15,669
Rym: Yeah, actually cuz everyone's running their own DNS internally for all these basically a bunch of intro.

562
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:17,259
Scott: Yeah, it's like how do you fucking find that?

563
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:19,030
Rym: It's a bunch of intranets connected together.

564
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:25,775
Rym: So actually extranets are what the generic case of the word internet was but because we don't use the word for that anymore We call it extranets.

565
00:33:26,117 --> 00:33:37,453
Rym: So extranets and intranets are lowercase I. The internet is uppercase I. All other uses of internet are lowercase I. That is my position Whatever.

566
00:33:38,118 --> 00:33:40,090
Scott: I'm gonna keep up keep an internet uppercase.

567
00:33:40,391 --> 00:33:51,742
Rym: Also, you're not allowed per the style guide to use the two-letter abbreviations of US state names anymore because it's confusing to people who don't Live in America and apparently it's confusing to a lot of people who live in America now.

568
00:33:52,343 --> 00:33:56,036
Scott: Tell me what is the two-letter Abbreviation.

569
00:33:56,056 --> 00:33:56,901
Rym: Montana or Maine?

570
00:33:56,921 --> 00:34:00,375
Rym: Those are the ones that mess people up usually For Maine.

571
00:34:00,415 --> 00:34:01,399
Rym: Maine is ME, right?

572
00:34:01,479 --> 00:34:01,720
Rym: Yeah.

573
00:34:02,102 --> 00:34:02,543
Scott: Are you sure?

574
00:34:02,764 --> 00:34:03,688
Scott: I'm reasonably sure.

575
00:34:03,748 --> 00:34:04,230
Scott: What's Missouri?

576
00:34:05,511 --> 00:34:06,195
Rym: M.O.

577
00:34:06,215 --> 00:34:07,262
Scott: I think you're right.

578
00:34:07,564 --> 00:34:14,478
Rym: Yeah, I know my shit Because Montana is MT, I'm pretty sure.

579
00:34:14,498 --> 00:34:16,063
Rym: Yeah, Maine is ME, so I'm good.

580
00:34:16,284 --> 00:34:16,967
Scott: And then Mississippi.

581
00:34:17,368 --> 00:34:29,502
Rym: I'm I Am I, cricket letter, cricket letter, I, cricket letter, cricket letter, I, humpback, humpback, I Things of the day.

582
00:34:29,522 --> 00:34:30,469
Scott: Oh shit, what was my thing of the day?

583
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:35,933
Rym: So, all right, I'm gonna talk a little bit about Angola's Wikipedia pirates Mm-hmm.

584
00:34:35,993 --> 00:34:40,636
Rym: This is a cool thing that's happening But there's a whole- This is too weird.

585
00:34:40,677 --> 00:34:43,625
Scott: Angola, Wikipedia, pirate, those are three words that don't go together.

586
00:34:43,685 --> 00:34:45,489
Rym: Oh, and it relates to digital colonialism.

587
00:34:46,511 --> 00:34:57,394
Rym: So the article is fascinating because basically you're gonna hit a bunch of topics that are themselves fascinating by looking at this and This is sort of like a whole of stuff You probably have not encountered.

588
00:34:57,735 --> 00:35:05,339
Rym: but the angle that the entry point of this whole article is that Wikipedia Wikimedia, so Wikipedia and you know, like all the other line.

589
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:08,810
Scott: Wikipedia is run by the Wikimedia Foundation, which does other things also.

590
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:09,713
Rym: Yeah, so it's not just Wikipedia.

591
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:10,878
Scott: Mostly they run Wikipedia.

592
00:35:10,918 --> 00:35:14,270
Rym: Like they have hosting for like public domain stuff.

593
00:35:14,391 --> 00:35:15,116
Scott: They do a lot of shit.

594
00:35:15,297 --> 00:35:25,390
Rym: Yeah, and Facebook got together I think some other companies are involved too, to give Angola free access to their websites But not the rest of the internet, the whole net neutrality thing, but they did this.

595
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:38,097
Rym: No, yes, and I while I think that's shitty if you- India said no, India took the smart route But India has a lot more developed infrastructure than Angola In a lot of ways.

596
00:35:38,118 --> 00:35:39,950
Scott: You should have said give me the whole internet.

597
00:35:40,231 --> 00:35:41,394
Scott: So anyway, this exists.

598
00:35:41,455 --> 00:35:46,230
Rym: So if you're in Angola, you have free access to Wikipedia, Facebook, and a few other things.

599
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:49,320
Rym: I'm just gonna quote the article.

600
00:35:49,823 --> 00:35:57,490
Rym: So naturally Angolans have started hiding pirated movies and music in Wikipedia articles and linking to them on closed Facebook groups.

601
00:35:57,958 --> 00:36:07,652
Rym: And The degree to which nerds in Angola have hacked Wikipedia to hide pirated material is amazing.

602
00:36:08,034 --> 00:36:17,488
Rym: Like copy-pasting an entire novel into a rarely read Wikipedia article Telling other people and everyone just goes that article and copy-paste it out for as long as they can before someone fixes it.

603
00:36:18,433 --> 00:36:19,640
Scott: Good job Angola.

604
00:36:19,862 --> 00:36:22,995
Rym: Yeah, this is widespread and Amazing.

605
00:36:23,116 --> 00:36:25,209
Scott: Maybe you should give people the whole internet next time.

606
00:36:25,491 --> 00:36:31,006
Rym: Yeah, so never discount, you know, as much as you know stuff goes out around the world.

607
00:36:31,107 --> 00:36:33,956
Rym: go Angola never That.

608
00:36:34,016 --> 00:36:40,294
Rym: if there's a place with nerds and they have access to an internet It's your birthday.

609
00:36:40,595 --> 00:36:41,880
Rym: nature finds a way.

610
00:36:42,141 --> 00:36:42,985
Scott: go Angola.

611
00:36:43,487 --> 00:36:44,250
Scott: You're my heroes.

612
00:36:44,933 --> 00:36:47,425
Rym: You got a thing of the day like the 90s.

613
00:36:47,465 --> 00:36:50,798
Scott: You got a thing of the day Yeah, so here is see.

614
00:36:50,818 --> 00:36:54,330
Scott: I don't know how many people listening have used an Apple to computer.

615
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:55,437
Scott: I suspect all the old ones.

616
00:36:55,558 --> 00:36:56,464
Scott: I have some in my closet.

617
00:36:56,484 --> 00:37:01,770
Scott: I have one in my closet The Apple to computer the original one that cost like a zillion dollars.

618
00:37:02,791 --> 00:37:08,222
Scott: I think it costs like over a thousand dollars originally and no one could afford that in 1980 something That was like a million dollars in 1980, whatever.

619
00:37:11,114 --> 00:37:14,509
Scott: It had a problem and that you could only use cassette tapes with it Which is like the style of the times.

620
00:37:15,052 --> 00:37:22,490
Scott: so you would like you would plug in a cassette tape rewind it press play and it would load the whole program into the Apple to and then you could use it right and that sucked.

621
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:26,570
Scott: They wanted to use discs with the Apple to and using this with the Apple to.

622
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:28,199
Scott: well They didn't have a disk drive originally.

623
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:30,070
Scott: now they have one, but they didn't originally have one.

624
00:37:31,171 --> 00:37:35,810
Scott: So Steve Wozniak made the hardware for it and his hardware was like this genius hardware.

625
00:37:35,911 --> 00:37:39,770
Scott: I have some of the boards that do this because I have extra floppy drives.

626
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:46,680
Scott: Yeah and I have the exact boards that like the Steve Wozniak design and Basically, it's a. it's the genius of that design.

627
00:37:46,721 --> 00:37:47,504
Scott: people don't realize.

628
00:37:47,544 --> 00:37:48,670
Scott: is that up until that point?

629
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:51,318
Scott: Floppy disk controllers are mad expensive.

630
00:37:51,619 --> 00:37:51,800
Scott: Yes.

631
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,446
Scott: They were all hardware, right?

632
00:37:53,566 --> 00:37:54,590
Scott: Everything was done in hardware.

633
00:37:54,771 --> 00:38:00,330
Scott: He moved the complicated bits into software now put an IC on this on this board.

634
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:05,338
Rym: I just want to point out that similar things were done later to Dramatically opposite effect.

635
00:38:05,379 --> 00:38:06,850
Rym: remember the wind tell modems, right?

636
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:10,570
Scott: And this is why like the Apple to like there are other computers that have floppy disk drives.

637
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:20,184
Scott: but the Apple to was like the first time where like everyone could have a floppy disk drive and have a bunch of floppy disk because The board that the floppy drive was actually, you know usable and cheap enough.

638
00:38:20,244 --> 00:38:22,190
Scott: right the controller boards were cheap enough.

639
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:29,849
Scott: So but the problem was they had this thing, but they needed like they didn't need an OS But they needed like a file system kind of control.

640
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:35,669
Scott: You know, there's some sort of disk operating system some way to actually use floppy disk All right to make files to read and write from them.

641
00:38:37,191 --> 00:38:38,033
Scott: And that didn't exist.

642
00:38:38,053 --> 00:38:39,556
Scott: So actually no one at Apple wrote that.

643
00:38:39,596 --> 00:38:47,080
Scott: I found out from this article here that They hired someone to do that from like another company in the same like, you know a little campus whatever.

644
00:38:48,582 --> 00:38:51,080
Scott: And that was the Apple to disk operating system.

645
00:38:51,120 --> 00:39:00,157
Scott: And if you've ever put like an Apple to game on a floppy disk into an Apple to and turn it on It'll say like Apple to DOS version something something and then the game will start.

646
00:39:00,217 --> 00:39:02,626
Scott: Yep, right And that's.

647
00:39:02,848 --> 00:39:04,180
Scott: it's not really an operating system.

648
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:06,498
Scott: It's just really like a disk controlling kind of thing.

649
00:39:07,202 --> 00:39:11,659
Scott: But it also like has a basic interpreter and stuff like that and lets you read and write files and whatever.

650
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:20,160
Scott: and Finally the listing for that disk operating system is now publicly available for non-commercial use.

651
00:39:20,626 --> 00:39:21,539
Scott: You can read it yourself.

652
00:39:22,062 --> 00:39:26,600
Scott: And what's really fascinating is I've always wondered this like how did they write this to begin with?

653
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:31,100
Scott: It's like I can use an Apple to writing in basic once the disk operating system is loaded.

654
00:39:31,562 --> 00:39:37,486
Scott: I don't wouldn't know how to write at least without a lot of help something like on a Blank Apple to like.

655
00:39:37,506 --> 00:39:41,189
Scott: I don't know how to interface with that at all like an assembly like, okay I wrote.

656
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:41,899
Rym: what do you try?

657
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:45,571
Scott: It's like I wrote some assembly for Apple to.

658
00:39:45,852 --> 00:39:47,840
Scott: how do I assemble it and get the Apple to to run it?

659
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:48,780
Scott: I have no fucking clue.

660
00:39:49,481 --> 00:39:56,160
Scott: Apparently what they did Is they did it on a different computer with like punch cards?

661
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:02,499
Scott: Right, and then that computer asset did the assembly the Apple to couldn't assemble its own assembly, huh?

662
00:40:03,182 --> 00:40:13,920
Scott: Right, they assembled it on a different more powerful computer and then print it out like I just you know You know a long tape right and then we're able to load it on the Apple to nice.

663
00:40:14,541 --> 00:40:19,435
Scott: So here's the listing for that assembly that you have to assemble on a different not all man.

664
00:40:19,475 --> 00:40:20,578
Rym: It's just PDF here.

665
00:40:20,678 --> 00:40:22,143
Scott: Oh, man Yeah, check it out.

666
00:40:22,746 --> 00:40:24,151
Scott: I mean it was the print.

667
00:40:24,191 --> 00:40:24,794
Scott: it's a listing.

668
00:40:24,854 --> 00:40:27,196
Scott: It's not the code in a file It's a listing of.

669
00:40:27,237 --> 00:40:31,800
Scott: you know Like if they used to do that print out books of code and you would turn from page to page reading the code.

670
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:32,260
Rym: Yeah.

671
00:40:33,401 --> 00:40:34,043
Scott: So here you go.

672
00:40:34,585 --> 00:40:36,352
Rym: Enjoy in the minute moment.

673
00:40:36,452 --> 00:40:37,114
Rym: We were just as thank.

674
00:40:37,154 --> 00:40:37,656
Rym: I can't release.

675
00:40:37,877 --> 00:40:38,760
Rym: I was at Zenka Khan.

676
00:40:38,881 --> 00:40:40,108
Scott: I was wise enough not to go to.

677
00:40:40,128 --> 00:40:40,611
Scott: thank God.

678
00:40:40,651 --> 00:40:56,629
Rym: I went to the mocha festival Convention is PAX East which is coming up pretty soon a few weekends from April 22nd 23rd 24th on the 24th on Sunday We will be presenting sometime in the afternoon Atari game design and that's one of our panels.

679
00:40:56,649 --> 00:40:58,754
Rym: That is definitely not on YouTube anywhere.

680
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:00,258
Rym: It's also a pretty good panel.

681
00:41:00,278 --> 00:41:00,860
Rym: So stay tuned.

682
00:41:01,382 --> 00:41:04,414
Rym: otherwise, uh, stay tuned for whatever news might come of.

683
00:41:04,454 --> 00:41:05,799
Rym: other conventions were involved with.

684
00:41:05,819 --> 00:41:10,672
Rym: and Yeah, the next book a book is Margaret Edwards Oryx and Craig.

685
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:12,940
Rym: I'm going to start reading it within a week.

686
00:41:13,183 --> 00:41:14,079
Scott: I bought a copy already.

687
00:41:14,841 --> 00:41:20,480
Rym: I'm gonna finish the 12th book of the Wheel of Time because I'm mostly through it and I did start reading it though.

688
00:41:20,701 --> 00:41:23,489
Rym: Yeah, so I'll start reading in about a week.

689
00:41:23,509 --> 00:41:24,572
Rym: So you got a little bit of buffer.

690
00:41:24,712 --> 00:41:34,347
Scott: this Saturday April 9th is Netrunner regional championships in Massachusetts, which I bought a ticket to See if I go there as a who sits.

691
00:41:34,789 --> 00:41:40,520
Scott: Yeah, it's in Cambridge and you're like MIT areas So I have at least possible ways of getting there.

692
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:45,219
Scott: But it'll be weird going to Massachusetts and Boston area like three times in one month.

693
00:41:46,841 --> 00:41:49,014
Scott: Anime Boston net runner tournament packs.

694
00:41:49,095 --> 00:41:53,880
Rym: It's just like oh my god I once went to London and then went to Hong Kong in a separate trip and then stopped in love.

695
00:41:55,162 --> 00:41:59,955
Scott: Is the ninth then there's nothing the weekend after that and then packs is the weekend after that.

696
00:42:00,095 --> 00:42:01,680
Scott: actually I could doable.

697
00:42:02,023 --> 00:42:03,179
Rym: Yeah, they'll remember packs.

698
00:42:04,461 --> 00:42:08,796
Rym: This is not the four-day packs like prime and Sunday is not always super hopping.

699
00:42:08,856 --> 00:42:13,530
Rym: just because you know Boston is not the best venue for the outside of Khan hopping.

700
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:15,315
Rym: There'll be some hopping Thursday.

701
00:42:15,435 --> 00:42:17,280
Rym: day and night is gonna be really hopping.

702
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:22,820
Rym: So if you want to expand your paxies scenario, you want to get there Thursday like early afternoon?

703
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:31,432
Scott: Yeah, I'm thinking actually I might go Thursday and like Sunday, you know try to go home late Sunday.

704
00:42:31,472 --> 00:42:34,944
Rym: I was thinking about that too, but like real late on Sunday I might still take money off work.

705
00:42:35,405 --> 00:42:36,870
Rym: Maybe I'll leave late Sunday.

706
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:40,040
Rym: But then again, it's nice to just go to bed after a packs.

707
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:42,662
Rym: We'll see like there's something, you know I go.

708
00:42:42,944 --> 00:42:47,520
Rym: I've gone to a lot of conventions where I leave like Night, because I don't want to stay like through the whole thing.

709
00:42:47,621 --> 00:42:55,060
Scott: But if it's a big con, especially a con that I do a lot The thing is for the cost of a hotel room, right for much less than the cost of one night in a hotel.

710
00:42:55,301 --> 00:43:05,966
Scott: Yeah, I could take a cab from the bolt bus to my apartment and luxuriously get home at Sunday Or Scott for the price of another night in the room Which I would never something I would never do.

711
00:43:06,026 --> 00:43:10,568
Rym: I could take the Acela home and actually be home like real early like way Earlier than you think.

712
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:11,739
Scott: it's not gonna save that much time.

713
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:13,188
Rym: It's gonna cost a lot of money.

714
00:43:13,409 --> 00:43:14,154
Rym: compared it doesn't cost.

715
00:43:14,214 --> 00:43:15,140
Rym: I take you sell all the time.

716
00:43:15,841 --> 00:43:17,634
Scott: I'll probably buy tickets for tonight.

717
00:43:17,654 --> 00:43:18,460
Scott: That's like 12 bucks.

718
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:24,051
Rym: I'm gonna buy those tonight too, but if I was gonna take the Acela home Yes, so it's gonna hit someone and I'm gonna be home first.

719
00:43:24,171 --> 00:43:24,874
Rym: the Acela.

720
00:43:25,015 --> 00:43:26,280
Rym: if it hits someone they might not notice.

721
00:43:26,762 --> 00:43:28,308
Scott: Oh, it doesn't go that fast.

722
00:43:28,368 --> 00:43:29,432
Scott: No, it goes pretty fast.

723
00:43:29,653 --> 00:43:33,829
Scott: Not Shinkansen cells been going pretty good Not even 1/5 Shinkansen also Scott.

724
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:37,242
Rym: It's at least it's the money part of Amtrak.

725
00:43:37,302 --> 00:43:38,686
Rym: it's not the Pennsylvania part.

726
00:43:39,228 --> 00:43:42,076
Rym: All right, so Scott tells me he's been having trouble with HFS plus.

727
00:43:42,377 --> 00:43:43,360
Scott: well, okay.

728
00:43:43,501 --> 00:43:52,220
Scott: So, I don't know if people realize this but you know computers have different file systems that they use Right, like all your CD roms have like ISO 96 60 or whatever the fuck it.

729
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,980
Rym: Yeah, or like in the old days like on Linux.

730
00:43:54,100 --> 00:44:00,623
Scott: It was xt like and all your floppy disk used fat fat 16 and all your USB sticks probably using fat 32.

731
00:44:00,623 --> 00:44:01,955
Scott: Yeah, which is what Windows 98 used.

732
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:13,734
Rym: I'll remember the old days fat 32. and then when people started using, you know A lot of people were afraid to leave fat 32 Because the newer file systems on Windows were not accessible on Linux.

733
00:44:13,935 --> 00:44:16,245
Rym: and those grognards they are now They are now.

734
00:44:16,326 --> 00:44:17,095
Rym: NTFS just works.

735
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:21,215
Scott: fine NTFS is what your Windows computer uses and your Linux machines.

736
00:44:21,235 --> 00:44:25,700
Scott: you could use anything the fuck you want But you're probably using ext4 if it's modern, which is pretty great.

737
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:29,354
Rym: I still see a lot of systems that default to ext3 and I don't know why.

738
00:44:29,374 --> 00:44:30,740
Scott: well, they're just old.

739
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,104
Scott: Well, it's old kernels.

740
00:44:32,165 --> 00:44:34,794
Rym: Yeah, it's always people in selling like some old version of arch somewhere.

741
00:44:35,115 --> 00:44:37,303
Scott: stupid reason arch Usually just the newest.

742
00:44:37,363 --> 00:44:40,673
Scott: everything old version from a thing is old version.

743
00:44:40,693 --> 00:44:41,957
Scott: It's one of those rolling distros.

744
00:44:42,078 --> 00:44:42,399
Scott: Yeah.

745
00:44:42,519 --> 00:44:42,820
Rym: Anyway

746
00:44:43,762 --> 00:45:01,815
Scott: Some people use XFS some people use ZFS whatever but max OS X modern a brand new MacBook you buy today from the Apple Store Uses a file system known as HFS plus which is I guess slightly better than HFS and HFS Plus even even the plus one is garbage.

747
00:45:01,915 --> 00:45:02,417
Scott: It is like though.

748
00:45:02,497 --> 00:45:03,200
Scott: It's worse than fat.

749
00:45:03,583 --> 00:45:15,060
Scott: Maybe it's not as worse as fat 32, but it's Like I don't know a lot about HFS cuz I've never really well really I mean there are many problems with it under the hood that like no one cares about or will notice, right?

750
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:16,875
Rym: Well, yeah I mean I could say this like I used to.

751
00:45:16,896 --> 00:45:24,889
Scott: you know It's funny back when I cared a lot like it's not gonna give you the performance or the safety of like ext4 you know and all these kinds of things that no one cares about.

752
00:45:24,949 --> 00:45:26,054
Rym: I used to be like.

753
00:45:26,134 --> 00:45:35,011
Scott: I really like like when I made a Linux machine like I thought a lot about if you're a Linux user and you're not just doing defaults using ext4 for everything You have to think about file systems you like, you know what.

754
00:45:35,051 --> 00:45:37,725
Scott: I'm gonna put all these giant videos on this drive So I'll use XFS.

755
00:45:37,765 --> 00:45:40,680
Scott: Yeah, and I have to think about like what my block size is gonna be and stuff, right?

756
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:41,243
Scott: You know, whatever.

757
00:45:41,364 --> 00:45:43,840
Rym: Yeah, I know you and you you thought it mattered.

758
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:45,367
Rym: It usually didn't actually matter that much.

759
00:45:45,387 --> 00:45:58,318
Scott: the main problem with HFS plus is that it is not Case sensitive which means if you go to a directory and you make a file like readme.txt All lowercase readme.txt and you make another file all uppercase readme.txt.

760
00:45:59,245 --> 00:46:05,760
Scott: Those are actually the same file on Every other file system that I've ever used that I. as far as I can remember.

761
00:46:06,384 --> 00:46:07,551
Scott: That is not the case, right?

762
00:46:07,611 --> 00:46:23,560
Scott: If I go to my Windows machine I can make a file that's Scott.txt with a capital S or internet.txt with a capital I and a totally separate file internet.txt with a lowercase I and those will be two Separate files that are not the same file in any way, which is pretty important.

763
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:34,000
Scott: Like when you're programming something right, you know If you're programming file names into your code or in your settings for your you know Code's gonna use you gotta put file names in there, right and they got to be the right file name.

764
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:35,589
Scott: Otherwise the wrong file is gonna get opened.

765
00:46:35,629 --> 00:46:40,837
Scott: if there's two different files with you know Only thing differentiating their names being the case of the letters in there.

766
00:46:40,857 --> 00:46:47,856
Scott: Now the counterpoint I usually see is people arguing that in practice You shouldn't be putting two files in the same directory with the same name.

767
00:46:47,896 --> 00:46:48,520
Scott: We're only cases.

768
00:46:50,045 --> 00:46:57,788
Rym: if you ever have a file called internet.txt with a lowercase I and Uppercase I and they're in the same directory fucked up.

769
00:46:57,929 --> 00:46:58,751
Rym: Yeah, you there's.

770
00:46:58,972 --> 00:47:01,179
Rym: there is a deep problem with you.

771
00:47:02,221 --> 00:47:03,005
Scott: Maybe that's the case.

772
00:47:03,386 --> 00:47:10,179
Rym: Yeah, but that was always the argument that they would assume that Users of computers would never want to do something like that.

773
00:47:10,501 --> 00:47:18,617
Rym: So if you put if you have a bunch of characters that are a file name They assume that if you use a similar set of characters that differs only in case you meant that file.

774
00:47:18,657 --> 00:47:19,500
Scott: Well, that's bullshit.

775
00:47:20,641 --> 00:47:22,547
Scott: Everything should be case-sensitive pretty much always.

776
00:47:22,607 --> 00:47:27,787
Rym: Actually I haven't thought about this a lot because I explicit is always better than implicit true but I have all I've.

777
00:47:27,888 --> 00:47:34,032
Rym: I always think about this in terms of applications and keys and databases and that kind of stuff.

778
00:47:34,072 --> 00:47:41,322
Rym: but here the fat fat 32 NTFS, HFS plus all case insensitive Apparently.

779
00:47:41,402 --> 00:47:42,165
Rym: and what?

780
00:47:42,627 --> 00:47:51,153
Rym: apparently NTFS if you mount it in Unix is case sensitive Yes, but it's not case sensitive normally anyway.

781
00:47:51,254 --> 00:47:52,958
Rym: interesting yeah, I did some.

782
00:47:55,403 --> 00:47:59,780
Rym: I just I found a Wikipedia article and I found some links that are telling me things I didn't know about NTFS.

783
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:00,904
Rym: So I got distracted right?

784
00:48:00,964 --> 00:48:04,800
Scott: So the major problem here is that let's say somebody is working on a Mac.

785
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:17,400
Scott: They're you know developer at my work, right and they're writing some JavaScript or something, right and in their JavaScript code They write something like include my file dot JS and they in their code They write like all lowercase my file dot JS.

786
00:48:18,142 --> 00:48:24,059
Scott: But actually when they make the file they make it like my file dot JS or some camel case uppercase M uppercase F.

787
00:48:24,521 --> 00:48:32,040
Rym: See now I would already feel not talking about specific technology that if I'm referring to a name of a library It should never be case sensitive, right?

788
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:35,119
Scott: But so on their computer that totally works.

789
00:48:35,561 --> 00:48:36,063
Scott: Right, they?

790
00:48:36,103 --> 00:48:41,060
Scott: because my file dot JS is my file dot JS on a Mac with HFS plus.

791
00:48:41,822 --> 00:48:46,556
Scott: And then you give that code to someone else to run on this Linux server in production.

792
00:48:47,218 --> 00:48:47,940
Scott: and what happens?

793
00:48:48,603 --> 00:48:51,500
Scott: File not found my file dot JS no such file.

794
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:55,417
Rym: Wait HFS plus is listed as both case sensitive and case insensitive.

795
00:48:55,437 --> 00:49:04,540
Scott: That is correct because in fact if you are extremely wise You can actually flip a little blip and make it case sensitive and fix everything.

796
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,827
Rym: However, however, does that break other things?

797
00:49:07,529 --> 00:49:08,592
Scott: it breaks two things.

798
00:49:08,693 --> 00:49:15,813
Scott: number one every single OS X Application that you try to use that is because the default is case insensitive.

799
00:49:16,214 --> 00:49:23,780
Scott: every OS X application that you try to use That is basically not ever thinking that the file system will be case sensitive is now going to break.

800
00:49:24,142 --> 00:49:29,179
Scott: So anything that's not coded extremely well For your Mac will just not work.

801
00:49:29,741 --> 00:49:31,246
Scott: So good luck changing that setting.

802
00:49:31,387 --> 00:49:37,208
Rym: in any realistic scenario where you actually want to run software, right riser I forgot about that didn't kill his wife or something.

803
00:49:37,489 --> 00:49:38,795
Scott: Yeah, something weird.

804
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:39,337
Scott: don't use that.

805
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:39,860
Scott: It's dead.

806
00:49:40,982 --> 00:49:49,340
Scott: Because so whoever the other problem being Yeah, try to flip that before like before OS X installs and rewrites.

807
00:49:49,541 --> 00:49:51,487
Scott: It's like you can't flip the switch early enough.

808
00:49:51,587 --> 00:49:58,932
Scott: by the time you flip the switch OS X is already installed and all these case insensitive files are already there at least if that were an option in Unix.

809
00:49:59,012 --> 00:50:02,917
Rym: like you have full control like you can bootstrap your own Stupid system if you want, right?

810
00:50:03,601 --> 00:50:05,348
Scott: Yeah, so I'm not sure exactly how.

811
00:50:05,689 --> 00:50:08,600
Scott: I'm sure you can flip it after the fact somehow but good luck with that.

812
00:50:08,801 --> 00:50:10,026
Rym: So you want to have some extra fun this.

813
00:50:10,227 --> 00:50:14,608
Rym: I think I mentioned this once the GeekNights before but this is I don't even know What would happen in the file system?

814
00:50:14,669 --> 00:50:15,797
Rym: So what if I in HFS?

815
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:20,581
Rym: Made a file that used the Turkish I instead of a normal I?

816
00:50:21,083 --> 00:50:25,779
Scott: yeah Unicode is another big reason that we shouldn't make things case insensitive, right?

817
00:50:27,141 --> 00:50:32,020
Scott: You know, actually if you make so you make uppercase I and lowercase I are just two different Unicode characters.

818
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:33,045
Scott: What's what's uppercase?

819
00:50:33,085 --> 00:50:38,200
Scott: There's no such thing right from the perspective of bits in a file name But there's a bunch of different uppercase.

820
00:50:39,605 --> 00:50:43,498
Rym: So if I write code in Turkish, will it now not work if the libraries are named?

821
00:50:43,518 --> 00:50:44,240
Scott: this is what I'm saying.

822
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:47,600
Scott: What is uppercase and lowercase is from a computer's perspective, right?

823
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:54,940
Scott: It's you're basically just saying apply this flag to any of these Unicode characters and they map to these other Unicode characters.

824
00:50:55,302 --> 00:51:03,240
Scott: so for the purposes of looking at file names only Consider these 26 Unicode characters to be the same as these other 26 Unicode characters.

825
00:51:03,601 --> 00:51:08,838
Scott: All of the Unicode characters are unique except these 26 are the same as those 26 with a one-to-one mapping.

826
00:51:08,858 --> 00:51:11,655
Scott: and it's like Why are you putting that nonsense exception in there?

827
00:51:11,696 --> 00:51:12,320
Scott: Just make it wait.

828
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,952
Scott: No file name is a string of Unicode characters that are unique.

829
00:51:14,972 --> 00:51:15,112
Scott: the.

830
00:51:15,153 --> 00:51:16,800
Rym: my file name has an uppercase one.

831
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:19,852
Rym: So I guess the exclamation point right exactly, right?

832
00:51:19,893 --> 00:51:20,495
Scott: You wouldn't do that.

833
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:21,640
Scott: That's nonsense, right?

834
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:29,500
Rym: but at the same time so alright if because if you're doing the uppercase lowercase thing then again the Turkish I The dot I and not dot I are different.

835
00:51:29,842 --> 00:51:33,080
Rym: So if I uppercase a dot I it's an uppercase I with a dot on it.

836
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:37,740
Scott: I mean of all people Linus Torvalds has like you can find he has many rants, right?

837
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:38,864
Scott: he has a rant about this.

838
00:51:38,904 --> 00:51:53,246
Scott: basically talking about HFS plus is the worst piece of garbage on earth and As is often the case when he gives these kinds of technological rants He is a mostly right and B half the words are him saying stupid moron stupid You know, so

839
00:51:53,387 --> 00:51:54,735
Rym: I think a little bit of by

840
00:51:54,756 --> 00:51:55,259
Scott: cetera, etc.

841
00:51:55,761 --> 00:51:56,142
Rym: Suspect.

842
00:51:56,162 --> 00:52:01,560
Rym: there's an interesting the the tone of the words in the Wikipedia article about HFS plus which I'm looking at.

843
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:02,839
Rym: Cuz I don't know a lot about HFS.

844
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,023
Scott: Let's see who wrote quotes.

845
00:52:04,625 --> 00:52:13,371
Rym: due to the age of HFS plus several features that are currently considered staples of modern file systems Like ZFS or riser FS are not present.

846
00:52:13,552 --> 00:52:14,637
Scott: That's true, which is true.

847
00:52:15,018 --> 00:52:17,224
Scott: Apparently Plus is a garbage.

848
00:52:17,505 --> 00:52:19,690
Rym: Let's see nanosecond timestamps are not there.

849
00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:26,146
Rym: Nope, which actually could be a problem actually like Concurrent access.

850
00:52:26,266 --> 00:52:28,700
Rym: It's basically an old file check summing snap shotting.

851
00:52:29,242 --> 00:52:36,811
Scott: Okay, imagine if Windows like barely updated like me instead of making NTFS They had made like fat 64 and then they just stuck with that.

852
00:52:37,233 --> 00:52:41,589
Rym: Okay, so real until today It does not have proper hard linking.

853
00:52:41,629 --> 00:52:43,958
Rym: but are there modern use cases for true hard links?

854
00:52:44,259 --> 00:52:44,560
Rym: Really?

855
00:52:45,622 --> 00:52:47,133
Scott: Yes, but the point is one.

856
00:52:47,415 --> 00:52:49,160
Scott: is that Name one.

857
00:52:49,244 --> 00:52:56,198
Rym: Yeah for a proper like fully compliant hard link like in the b-tree or whatever the file system uses.

858
00:52:56,298 --> 00:53:02,180
Scott: because some Application I have a file right and I want to put the file in like someone's home folder for example.

859
00:53:02,583 --> 00:53:08,216
Scott: But I also want the file to be in like var Www say for example so that a different application can look at it.

860
00:53:08,236 --> 00:53:13,495
Scott: I don't want to just put a similar Because it may be a sim link isn't gonna work right cuz sim links aren't really.

861
00:53:13,736 --> 00:53:30,209
Scott: they're not true links No, but a hard link will totally get the job done, yeah anyway The point is is that there is absolutely no reason I can see why they can't just ship like the next version of OS X with like ext4 or ZFS or any UNIX file.

862
00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:30,631
Scott: It's just you.

863
00:53:30,792 --> 00:53:31,655
Scott: OS X is just UNIX.

864
00:53:31,675 --> 00:53:33,040
Scott: You can use any UNIX file system.

865
00:53:33,902 --> 00:53:34,646
Scott: It's open source.

866
00:53:34,667 --> 00:53:41,757
Scott: There's already a bunch of open source stuff in OS X. It probably would be like minimal labor to just ship OS X well with any

867
00:53:41,817 --> 00:53:42,379
Rym: modern file

868
00:53:42,399 --> 00:53:49,039
Scott: system Except for the issue of There's probably a lot of software out there that will break when the file system becomes case-sensitive

869
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:52,740
Rym: Makes it the opposite of a minor problem with trivial effort.

870
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:53,383
Scott: I think that you just.

871
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:58,263
Scott: you know everyone who has actually has a program that people still use bugs and they'll be done.

872
00:53:58,384 --> 00:53:58,564
Rym: so.

873
00:53:58,724 --> 00:54:08,048
Rym: Microsoft developers like dotnet people have to complain forever about the file path file name limitations Even though modern file systems can.

874
00:54:08,128 --> 00:54:18,334
Rym: you can have very very very long paths and file names For all intents and purposes like any software you run in Windows or right in Windows Like you just won't work if your path gets too long.

875
00:54:18,414 --> 00:54:19,680
Rym: Yeah, so shit'll break randomly.

876
00:54:20,105 --> 00:54:32,010
Rym: Microsoft has said unequivocally They will never address it because the cost of figuring out all the things that'll break and dealing with that is not worth them even Considering they will never remove that limitation.

877
00:54:32,031 --> 00:54:33,094
Rym: Mmm.

878
00:54:33,114 --> 00:54:35,060
Rym: So this is probably gonna be in that same boat.

879
00:54:35,576 --> 00:54:44,244
Rym: Yeah Until I don't know until I guess until they switch until they pull a Windows and switch from you know HFS to some fundamentally different You know.

880
00:54:45,501 --> 00:54:50,240
Scott: First of all, you could do it in iOS because right it doesn't even matter in iOS is no file.

881
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:54,320
Rym: They could make their own custom file system that had a way to handle legacy application.

882
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:55,445
Scott: Why write a file system?

883
00:54:55,485 --> 00:54:58,136
Scott: someone already wrote like the best file systems ever for free.

884
00:54:58,277 --> 00:54:59,000
Scott: Why would you write one?

885
00:54:59,201 --> 00:55:00,347
Scott: That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

886
00:55:00,387 --> 00:55:02,459
Rym: Yeah, they'll take it and fork it or something nonsense like that.

887
00:55:02,741 --> 00:55:10,755
Rym: That's like I mean I'm saying what I think is gonna happen is The people who care about this will be mad and nothing will not change in the foreseeable future.

888
00:55:10,775 --> 00:55:12,360
Scott: No, well, nothing's it change.

889
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:14,691
Scott: Yeah, I'm just saying is that this is a thing.

890
00:55:14,731 --> 00:55:20,896
Scott: That's a big problem that people don't even know and The only people argue that file system should be case insensitive are bad.

891
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:26,059
Rym: And now you can argue that like certain key lines line is terrible.

892
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:27,147
Scott: to say They're stupid.

893
00:55:27,369 --> 00:55:33,494
Rym: a key field in a database You might want to make case insensitive and you might have a good reason for that But that's not a file system.

894
00:55:33,514 --> 00:55:40,660
Rym: file systems Like the underlying infrastructure of your storage that is you don't want to have implicit assumptions about that.

895
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:46,160
Scott: The only times you want things to be case insensitive is like up at the user interface level like someone searches for like dog.

896
00:55:46,361 --> 00:55:51,348
Scott: it's like yeah, you want to return results if someone typed it if the you know, The article has a capital dog or like.

897
00:55:51,388 --> 00:55:54,080
Scott: say you have a system below the user interface level.

898
00:55:54,461 --> 00:55:55,003
Scott: You don't.

899
00:55:55,023 --> 00:55:59,538
Scott: you want case sensitivity perfectly for everything because that's computers dealing with that.

900
00:55:59,558 --> 00:55:59,940
Scott: They need to be.

901
00:56:01,063 --> 00:56:03,852
Rym: Also anything that's human readable shouldn't be your key.

902
00:56:03,872 --> 00:56:07,183
Rym: your key should be some UID or some nonsense on the back end Like it's not you.

903
00:56:07,545 --> 00:56:10,016
Rym: So yeah, like say you want to make a report your system.

Rym: And I've decided because at least as I look right now if you look at the front-end number We're just shy of that first stretch goal of me remastering and re-releasing well, I guess releasing all of the Pre-GeekNights launch beta episode some of which none of you have ever heard.

933
00:58:37,638 --> 00:58:47,340
Rym: for sure most of you never heard them, but I think what I'll do because The actual amount of money you're pledging is well above what that threshold was set to.

934
00:58:47,761 --> 00:58:51,700
Rym: It's just that kick patreon changed the way they count the submission money and everything.
