1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,476
Rym: So one of the annoyances of New York is that you got to pay rent and most land.

2
00:00:13,496 --> 00:00:14,640
Scott: that's not annoyance of New York.

3
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,079
Scott: There's an annoyance of everywhere.

4
00:00:16,261 --> 00:00:22,444
Scott: Well, it's you have to pay for shelters because at least when I live shelters are not free No matter where you go.

5
00:00:22,464 --> 00:00:36,260
Rym: when I live in like I don't know some dumpy small town or like when I rent it Remember the place that you slept on the floor that one time like when you rent a place like that You have the landlord that you like hand cash or a check to like every month or whatever.

6
00:00:36,581 --> 00:00:39,290
Rym: But at least it feels like that's the level of service you'd expect.

7
00:00:39,711 --> 00:00:44,376
Rym: but in New York even in like super fancy buildings You can't just pay your rent online.

8
00:00:44,497 --> 00:00:51,140
Rym: usually Usually you still have to like mail a check every month and it's just just really like old-school archaic nonsense.

9
00:00:51,361 --> 00:00:51,963
Scott: I pay it online.

10
00:00:52,384 --> 00:00:55,275
Rym: Yeah, so my building announced a few months ago.

11
00:00:55,335 --> 00:00:56,639
Rym: Yeah, we got an online system.

12
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,167
Rym: now Just make an account log in here.

13
00:00:58,187 --> 00:00:59,434
Rym: You get your rent stuff.

14
00:00:59,594 --> 00:01:00,660
Rym: You can set up auto pay.

15
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:01,565
Rym: You can just pay it.

16
00:01:01,786 --> 00:01:03,655
Rym: You can even put a fucking credit card in if you want.

17
00:01:03,675 --> 00:01:06,087
Scott: We don't care go nuts Mmm, I can't use a credit card.

18
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,393
Scott: I have to use a debit card online.

19
00:01:07,453 --> 00:01:15,320
Rym: Yeah, so, uh, I finally like it was set up and I went to pay the rent You know the first of the month in the website and I was gonna set up auto pay.

20
00:01:15,903 --> 00:01:19,519
Rym: and I set it up and then I noticed that the number is not what I expected.

21
00:01:19,539 --> 00:01:25,940
Rym: and I click in and I see that there is a convenience fee to pay with my credit card.

22
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:26,562
Scott: I don't have that.

23
00:01:26,763 --> 00:01:27,687
Rym: so I think alright fine.

24
00:01:27,707 --> 00:01:27,988
Rym: Whatever.

25
00:01:28,028 --> 00:01:28,912
Rym: I'll use my debit card.

26
00:01:29,273 --> 00:01:29,474
Rym: Nope.

27
00:01:29,514 --> 00:01:30,498
Rym: There's still a convenience fee.

28
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:33,167
Rym: fine I'll set up my checking account.

29
00:01:33,247 --> 00:01:34,271
Rym: still a convenience fee.

30
00:01:34,512 --> 00:01:36,177
Rym: What do you think that convenience fee was?

31
00:01:36,618 --> 00:01:37,040
Rym: Let's play.

32
00:01:38,201 --> 00:01:40,428
Rym: Let's play obviously a lot.

33
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,876
Scott: It's probably some percentage of your rent.

34
00:01:42,896 --> 00:01:44,180
Scott: So it's probably hundreds of dollars.

35
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,731
Rym: No, it was actually only $45 per rent check.

36
00:01:46,772 --> 00:01:47,977
Scott: That's still fuck you money.

37
00:01:48,098 --> 00:01:54,479
Rym: Yeah So and now because I signed up for the account, they won't give me physical rent things anymore.

38
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:59,568
Rym: No, so I either have to pay $45 a month extra.

39
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:04,909
Scott: I'd go to small clean I call him and if they did if they fought with me I'd go to small claims court or on the website.

40
00:02:05,471 --> 00:02:07,720
Rym: I can just print the thing and then mail it to them.

41
00:02:08,062 --> 00:02:08,324
Rym: Mm-hmm.

42
00:02:08,465 --> 00:02:08,868
Scott: That's fine.

43
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,506
Rym: So I did that but They got a choice email for me.

44
00:02:12,587 --> 00:02:13,731
Rym: That was like WTF.

45
00:02:14,213 --> 00:02:16,260
Rym: I do not accept the terms and conditions of bullshit.

46
00:02:16,702 --> 00:02:23,850
Rym: Send me physical printed things again, because I don't know a printer who owns a printer in 2016 on purpose Unless you have an old one that just happens to still work.

47
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:27,605
Rym: if that if your black and white printer broke today It's a printer right there.

48
00:02:27,826 --> 00:02:29,334
Scott: I see it does not work.

49
00:02:29,394 --> 00:02:30,479
Scott: How does that not work?

50
00:02:31,662 --> 00:02:32,305
Rym: To stop working.

51
00:02:32,767 --> 00:02:33,490
Scott: I think it'll work.

52
00:02:33,691 --> 00:02:47,328
Rym: Nah, so if you so if you Kind of jiggle it the whole time It'll pull the paper in about seventy five percent of the time and it'll print really light gray Whatever you wanted to print sometimes.

53
00:02:47,348 --> 00:02:49,395
Scott: I think you just put a new toner cartridge in.

54
00:02:49,456 --> 00:02:50,640
Rym: I could but I'm not gonna bother.

55
00:02:50,761 --> 00:02:52,153
Rym: I'm probably just gonna throw the whole printer away.

56
00:02:52,173 --> 00:02:54,819
Scott: Cuz but I got a printer works great.

57
00:02:55,121 --> 00:02:58,840
Rym: If your printer died today, would you buy another one as soon as I need to print something?

58
00:02:59,160 --> 00:02:59,584
Rym: All right, when do you?

59
00:02:59,604 --> 00:03:01,299
Rym: when was the last time you needed to print something?

60
00:03:02,161 --> 00:03:10,419
Scott: carries printed out some Netrunner card pictures and then I made them the same size as netrunner cards and I cut them out.

61
00:03:11,182 --> 00:03:14,758
Scott: Put him in the sleeve in front of a garbage netrunner card because you don't have enough copies.

62
00:03:14,798 --> 00:03:17,660
Scott: proxies You don't have enough copy only have three copies of a car.

63
00:03:17,782 --> 00:03:18,980
Rym: I played a physical card game.

64
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:20,025
Rym: I would have a printer for the.

65
00:03:20,045 --> 00:03:22,314
Scott: put this one card in every deck you got.

66
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,745
Scott: but you only got three of them and you Need like 12 of them.

67
00:03:24,946 --> 00:03:29,063
Scott: and then there's a whole bunch of other cards that you're never gonna use cuz they're garbage way below the Burrito frontier.

68
00:03:29,123 --> 00:03:33,180
Scott: Yeah, and you just use those as to stiffen up the sleeve there and you put the piece of paper.

69
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:37,380
Rym: I did that with my color desk jet back in the day with magic cards, right?

70
00:03:37,763 --> 00:03:38,252
Scott: That's what you do.

71
00:03:39,281 --> 00:03:41,148
Rym: And then one of my rich friends wouldn't?

72
00:03:41,228 --> 00:03:44,600
Rym: he refused to play with us if we use proxies because he was like, it's not fair.

73
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,440
Rym: I had to get this card with my parents money.

74
00:03:47,744 --> 00:03:50,687
Rym: He didn't say my parents money But that's how he had the card.

75
00:03:51,028 --> 00:03:54,260
Rym: so you don't get to use the card for free and we all just stopped playing magic with him.

76
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,103
Scott: That sounds right.

77
00:03:55,363 --> 00:03:56,507
Rym: Yeah, fuck him.

78
00:03:56,848 --> 00:03:58,755
Rym: He stopped being friends with us and I didn't really regret it.

79
00:03:59,517 --> 00:04:00,280
Scott: I was in middle school.

80
00:04:00,401 --> 00:04:03,140
Scott: I was too stupid to just make magic cards and play.

81
00:04:04,423 --> 00:04:06,359
Scott: I didn't realize that was such a great idea.

82
00:04:06,762 --> 00:04:10,060
Scott: We could have made all the because they're all these decks I would read about and strategy guys.

83
00:04:10,302 --> 00:04:11,860
Rym: Everyone read about those decks like there was.

84
00:04:12,801 --> 00:04:15,775
Scott: Yeah, I'm like in middle school and I'm just like man.

85
00:04:15,795 --> 00:04:16,820
Scott: I'll never be able to play that deck.

86
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,149
Scott: There's no way I can get all those cards.

87
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:18,853
Scott: Oh damn.

88
00:04:18,975 --> 00:04:26,740
Scott: Oh, well, yeah And then it's just like if I would have realized that I would have been like, oh shit I can just play we it's not it's only us middle school kids plan.

89
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,242
Scott: No,

90
00:04:27,302 --> 00:04:48,099
Rym: my other friends not only would that they would make their own magic cards like design them but the rule was if you ever wanted to play a game with your don't design magic cards, no aunties were allowed and Everyone at the event had to take the magic card that you designed that you wanted to put in your deck and They had to look at you in the eye and say whether or not it was good or not.

91
00:04:48,481 --> 00:04:52,193
Rym: We pretty much never let anyone's fucking magic card in cuz they're always just opie bullshit.

92
00:04:52,413 --> 00:04:52,915
Rym: Yeah.

93
00:04:52,955 --> 00:04:53,918
Scott: Yeah, we didn't make.

94
00:04:53,938 --> 00:04:57,052
Scott: I mean We probably thought of her on magic cards, but no we made him.

95
00:04:57,092 --> 00:04:58,338
Rym: we made him like real high.

96
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,048
Scott: I definitely weren't gonna let anyone use him in a real game.

97
00:05:01,088 --> 00:05:07,543
Scott: And also the ones we would design would be like You know stupid ones like oh, yeah Golden dragon stupid.

98
00:05:07,604 --> 00:05:08,246
Scott: it was like stopwatch.

99
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,411
Rym: It was like for green mana and like to colorless.

100
00:05:14,852 --> 00:05:16,980
Rym: other player skips their next turn.

101
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,286
Scott: There's already a card that does that in magic.

102
00:05:19,346 --> 00:05:22,856
Scott: It's called time time twister time warp something like that.

103
00:05:22,876 --> 00:05:25,187
Rym: I Barely remember it's.

104
00:05:25,227 --> 00:05:29,549
Scott: you'd basically take two turns in a row Vintage magic the other time twister.

105
00:05:29,589 --> 00:05:30,713
Scott: What does it say?

106
00:05:31,034 --> 00:05:35,125
Rym: No, each player shuffles his or her hand Time warp time warp.

107
00:05:35,346 --> 00:05:36,769
Scott: Yeah, it's definitely.

108
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:40,500
Scott: it's definitely a blue spell where you skip a turn magic card skip turn.

109
00:05:41,701 --> 00:05:42,322
Scott: What's it called?

110
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:43,685
Rym: Nothing's coming up.

111
00:05:44,106 --> 00:05:45,670
Scott: There's definitely a card that does this.

112
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:50,140
Rym: there's a deck that theoretically wins without anyone taking a turn.

113
00:05:51,306 --> 00:05:53,620
Rym: If I search for a magic card skip turn nothing comes up.

114
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,940
Scott: It's a really old card that they don't let you use.

115
00:05:56,061 --> 00:06:02,653
Rym: I feel like someone who'd written a blog that was like, all right There's a. here's a card that is no longer around.

116
00:06:02,693 --> 00:06:03,175
Rym: That's funny.

117
00:06:03,195 --> 00:06:05,146
Rym: I Can't find anything.

118
00:06:05,952 --> 00:06:06,798
Rym: I don't know if this exists.

119
00:06:09,696 --> 00:06:10,403
Scott: There was definitely.

120
00:06:10,584 --> 00:06:11,190
Scott: I'll keep looking.

121
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:23,368
Rym: I mean I'm not saying you're wrong But I am dubious because I feel like that would have come up in a Google search and I definitely did not remember a card Like that and time twister does something very different from that.

122
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:32,950
Rym: but anyway Things of the day because it's the GeekNights book club.

123
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:35,750
Rym: We don't waste your time with you know, anything other than the actual book.

124
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,218
Rym: But I feel like things of the day are important.

125
00:06:37,238 --> 00:06:37,942
Rym: So what do you got for me?

126
00:06:39,249 --> 00:06:45,695
Scott: Oh So I think the internet is slowly but surely More than before Realizing who.

127
00:06:45,735 --> 00:06:48,650
Scott: Casey Green is something we've known for like a long-ass time.

128
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,940
Rym: He's he green is one of those unsung heroes of.

129
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,130
Rym: he made things and you don't realize he made them.

130
00:06:53,451 --> 00:06:59,609
Scott: He made like, you know, he's not Neil Cicierega level, but he's the level under that Yeah, and I think he's actually tight with Neil Cicierega.

131
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:05,670
Scott: He's He probably is I imagine all the internet people who make all the good and live in one house together.

132
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:10,124
Scott: Yeah, they're all like in the same party whatever, you know, and that's how they figure shit out.

133
00:07:10,204 --> 00:07:14,078
Rym: Anyway, uh Hanging out with hell orb, right?

134
00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:16,368
Scott: So, you know Casey Green made the dog.

135
00:07:16,388 --> 00:07:18,703
Scott: that's in the room It's on fire and he says this is fun.

136
00:07:18,965 --> 00:07:19,590
Scott: So he made a wet.

137
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:24,621
Scott: He made a new comic where the dog is like, this is not fine It's on the nib and you can go read that.

138
00:07:24,681 --> 00:07:25,084
Scott: Yep.

139
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:26,090
Rym: It's actually real good.

140
00:07:26,792 --> 00:07:29,117
Rym: I was poking it around in some political circles.

141
00:07:29,137 --> 00:07:37,834
Rym: Okay, anyway, well cuz you know part of all that was the Republican Party used it and In there and he was like, I guess you're free to use it But fuck you.

142
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:41,190
Rym: and then he made a separate one like someone paid to make another version.

143
00:07:41,551 --> 00:07:45,424
Rym: That was literally the Republican Party's elephant sitting in the room being like this is fine.

144
00:07:45,444 --> 00:07:55,069
Scott: Anyway, so the He also has a Kickstarter going on where he's selling plush of that dog Plush, you know, he's got it.

145
00:07:55,150 --> 00:08:03,737
Scott: He has a problem where like there's so many people who take his materials and use them without crediting him Which is one thing but it's like it's.

146
00:08:03,857 --> 00:08:16,290
Scott: it's to another level where people like like dick But especially which he invented like people sell t-shirts with a dick But there's so much dick button merch that is not official dick But merch all his official merch is all into pedoco.

147
00:08:16,571 --> 00:08:17,534
Scott: It's not anywhere.

148
00:08:17,614 --> 00:08:24,377
Rym: can I not talking like some kid at an artist alley made like a silkscreen dick But and sold it at like a convention.

149
00:08:24,417 --> 00:08:30,209
Rym: This is like legit looking website selling dick butts like they own it commercially mass-produced.

150
00:08:31,251 --> 00:08:34,304
Rym: Yep, Casey Green's a good dude, or at least a good creator.

151
00:08:34,345 --> 00:08:35,350
Rym: I don't actually know him in person.

152
00:08:35,471 --> 00:08:36,837
Rym: I assume he's a good dude.

153
00:08:36,999 --> 00:08:38,366
Scott: I met him once at a comic-con.

154
00:08:38,426 --> 00:08:39,169
Rym: I met him a few times.

155
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:40,559
Scott: I don't see him in funny internet videos.

156
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,547
Rym: I follow him on Twitter.

157
00:08:41,748 --> 00:08:45,623
Rym: Sure But yeah, I should get that plush.

158
00:08:45,703 --> 00:08:46,206
Rym: It's a good deal.

159
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:49,377
Rym: I think it might be a good Kickstarter's gonna cash in which is great.

160
00:08:49,578 --> 00:08:50,803
Rym: Yeah, I'm always happy.

161
00:08:50,823 --> 00:08:53,553
Scott: Yeah, give someone also if you want a patreon That's someone to patreon.

162
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:58,070
Rym: Yeah, Neil Cicierega and and Casey Green both deserve your patreon money more than us.

163
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:01,729
Rym: However, I do put money into uh, Neil Cicierega's.

164
00:09:02,131 --> 00:09:02,936
Rym: I feel like I should up that.

165
00:09:03,037 --> 00:09:05,129
Rym: actually cuz I've been listening to more of his stuff lately.

166
00:09:05,831 --> 00:09:06,994
Rym: So I got a cover.

167
00:09:07,275 --> 00:09:19,345
Rym: I always like it when a band or a person with a particular genre or style Covers a song with a completely different style or from a completely different realm.

168
00:09:19,386 --> 00:09:23,568
Rym: Like I've always enjoyed that like Richard cheese I've always been a fan of dread Zeppelin that kind of stuff.

169
00:09:24,451 --> 00:09:26,559
Scott: So, uh-huh magic the gathering.

170
00:09:27,121 --> 00:09:30,853
Scott: one colorless one blue time Walk.

171
00:09:30,873 --> 00:09:32,221
Scott: take an extra turn after this one.

172
00:09:32,241 --> 00:09:36,758
Scott: Ah There you go, I wasn't walk.

173
00:09:36,878 --> 00:09:38,002
Scott: I was not hallucinating.

174
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:39,026
Rym: pretty sure it was that.

175
00:09:39,066 --> 00:09:40,190
Rym: I think that was an unlimited.

176
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,659
Scott: It was an old at the point.

177
00:09:41,699 --> 00:09:43,490
Scott: is it's an old ass card that I'm pretty sure was banned.

178
00:09:43,531 --> 00:09:44,869
Rym: I don't think it was in revised.

179
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:51,170
Rym: It was either banned or it was definitely an unlimited at least because when I do a search right now I see copies of it with a white border.

180
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:56,741
Rym: The only magic sets from that era that had a white border were Unlimited and revised.

181
00:09:56,781 --> 00:09:58,129
Scott: point is it's an old ass car.

182
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,647
Scott: It looks like an unlimited card that is that was banned or restricted or whatever.

183
00:10:01,687 --> 00:10:02,391
Scott: cuz it was way It was.

184
00:10:02,411 --> 00:10:03,800
Rym: I think it was in alpha and beta man.

185
00:10:03,841 --> 00:10:05,310
Scott: If you had four of these in your deck, right?

186
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:06,173
Scott: That's just like haha.

187
00:10:06,233 --> 00:10:07,497
Rym: Fuck you black borders.

188
00:10:07,537 --> 00:10:08,340
Rym: Definitely in beta.

189
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,370
Scott: Yeah, it's old ass car to get you know, so there you go.

190
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,997
Rym: I don't think I've ever seen this card in person.

191
00:10:13,017 --> 00:10:15,026
Rym: I remember these creepy freaky skeletons.

192
00:10:15,066 --> 00:10:15,790
Rym: I've seen it in.

193
00:10:16,192 --> 00:10:17,538
Scott: I've seen it in stores for sale.

194
00:10:17,981 --> 00:10:19,569
Scott: Yeah, that's about it.

195
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,856
Scott: A lot of money.

196
00:10:22,957 --> 00:10:28,969
Rym: the last listener who still knows a lot by heart of Imagine the Gathering Is it furious that we're slightly wrong about this card in some way?

197
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:42,190
Rym: so anyway, that kind of thing that I like this is possibly the best example of that ever and Scott was trying to guess before the show what it was, but no, it's not an all-star cover or anything like that.

198
00:10:43,033 --> 00:10:43,595
Rym: I can tell you.

199
00:10:43,615 --> 00:10:44,418
Rym: I give you a hint.

200
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,205
Rym: It's not a metal song though.

201
00:10:46,225 --> 00:10:47,430
Rym: It is covered by a metal band.

202
00:10:47,531 --> 00:10:48,998
Scott: I'm to say if it's a metal cover.

203
00:10:49,038 --> 00:10:51,410
Scott: The original song is not probably metal or hard rock.

204
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:53,798
Rym: Well, it's covered specifically by a death metal band.

205
00:10:53,818 --> 00:10:54,621
Rym: Mmm.

206
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:54,841
Rym: It's.

207
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:57,450
Rym: it's about four and a half minutes long in the song.

208
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,394
Rym: It's a pretty long song.

209
00:10:58,414 --> 00:10:59,197
Scott: That's not that long.

210
00:10:59,478 --> 00:11:01,465
Rym: It's four minutes and 33 seconds specifically.

211
00:11:01,485 --> 00:11:01,807
Rym: Mm-hmm.

212
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,776
Rym: Okay, because it's John Cage's 433.

213
00:11:04,776 --> 00:11:07,585
Rym: All right, you know John Cage's 433.

214
00:11:07,585 --> 00:11:09,050
Scott: Yeah, that's not that excited.

215
00:11:09,172 --> 00:11:10,090
Rym: I think it's pretty exciting.

216
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:20,631
Rym: So the way they cover it is they cover it in the proper style of they actually do like the whole setup and the county Like, you know one two three, and then they just sit there Mm-hmm.

217
00:11:21,033 --> 00:11:26,490
Rym: I feel like this is very much in the spirit of what John Cage intended people to do with his very avant-garde music.

218
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:34,629
Rym: So if you're not familiar with John Cage's 433, I suggest you don't listen to it But you listen to this far superior cover of it.

219
00:11:35,332 --> 00:11:42,510
Rym: So the GeekNights book club delayed because our Scott backers book came out and because I read literally the entire wheel of time.

220
00:11:43,292 --> 00:11:48,350
Scott: Just yeah, mostly that that one most of that part reading the great ordeal was not a great ordeal.

221
00:11:48,511 --> 00:11:52,274
Rym: I already started reading the greater wheel of time Great ordeals.

222
00:11:52,335 --> 00:11:58,090
Rym: primary ordeal was that I finished it and I was like, oh shit now there's like four years before this gets concluded.

223
00:11:58,232 --> 00:11:59,267
Scott: That's the real ordeal.

224
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,516
Rym: Patience I gotta learn from myself.

225
00:12:02,757 --> 00:12:08,941
Rym: don't read book series no matter how good they are until the author's dead or the series is done The D&D dead or done.

226
00:12:09,443 --> 00:12:10,830
Scott: Well, there's Oryx and Craig.

227
00:12:10,951 --> 00:12:15,250
Scott: I just learned after finished reading this that it's actually volume one of three and the series is done.

228
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:15,772
Scott: So.

229
00:12:15,852 --> 00:12:16,053
Scott: so

230
00:12:16,313 --> 00:12:29,459
Rym: having finished it because you said that before and you said that it colored your perception of the book Yeah And I had that in mind when I read the last line of the book and then I turned the page and that was the end I can see why that colored your perception.

231
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,964
Scott: Yes at the ending of the book.

232
00:12:31,305 --> 00:12:35,000
Scott: I did not think of as a cliffhanger I thought of it just like ah the end right.

233
00:12:35,261 --> 00:12:38,133
Scott: but then because there's a book two and three I didn't.

234
00:12:38,254 --> 00:12:41,609
Scott: and soon as I knew that I realized oh that ending is a cliffhanger ending.

235
00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:43,777
Rym: now I do know because other people have.

236
00:12:43,817 --> 00:12:54,990
Rym: basically many of our friends the people who are recommending Oryx and Craig to us so much Have said very specifically that Oryx and Craig is good But it is not the best of the trilogy by far and the three books are not.

237
00:12:55,372 --> 00:13:02,103
Rym: It's not like the second one picks up right where the first one left off No different saying you can guess where the second one's gonna be about right?

238
00:13:02,164 --> 00:13:03,528
Scott: It's like you don't need anyone to like.

239
00:13:03,548 --> 00:13:03,889
Scott: tell you.

240
00:13:04,191 --> 00:13:06,580
Rym: Well, you could guess either go forward or go back.

241
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,769
Scott: now, it's obviously about the people he meets at the end.

242
00:13:09,972 --> 00:13:10,820
Rym: No, not at all.

243
00:13:10,901 --> 00:13:11,628
Scott: I'm pretty sure it is.

244
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:17,430
Rym: No, at least the summary I was given is that it follows these other characters in a different part of the world.

245
00:13:18,171 --> 00:13:21,484
Scott: I'm pretty sure the end of the second book is gonna be the end of the first book also.

246
00:13:21,504 --> 00:13:23,834
Scott: I Don't think so.

247
00:13:23,854 --> 00:13:25,200
Scott: I think it is.

248
00:13:25,301 --> 00:13:27,089
Scott: Anyway, who knows we'll find out when I read it.

249
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:30,609
Rym: Yeah, I'll read the other two because everyone's telling me that they just as short.

250
00:13:31,412 --> 00:13:39,338
Rym: They only take six hours that you have to read the whole trilogy and the other ones are better not to say that Oryx and Craig Is bad, but anyway, is it about?

251
00:13:39,379 --> 00:13:41,370
Scott: does it follow other mad Adam people, right?

252
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,112
Scott: Is that what it's going?

253
00:13:42,213 --> 00:13:48,289
Rym: seems like the second one seems to follow two people who are locked in sex dungeons in a different part Of the world during the apocalypse.

254
00:13:49,511 --> 00:13:51,050
Scott: Okay, let's move already.

255
00:13:52,571 --> 00:13:58,909
Rym: So, uh, yeah Oryx and Craig if you did not read it We're gonna be talking about it assuming you read it.

256
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:03,690
Rym: But if you need to be convinced to read it before we do that, it was it what it's real short.

257
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:05,756
Rym: It's like it's a 12-hour read.

258
00:14:05,776 --> 00:14:09,507
Rym: if you're a real slow reader like a real slug me like six hours.

259
00:14:09,728 --> 00:14:10,310
Rym: It's a short book.

260
00:14:10,813 --> 00:14:11,580
Rym: It's very pointed.

261
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,292
Rym: It's Good.

262
00:14:13,614 --> 00:14:14,560
Rym: I really enjoyed it.

263
00:14:14,741 --> 00:14:16,270
Scott: What's really amazing about this book?

264
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:20,890
Scott: I think is that how much it's able to cover in such a small amount of book?

265
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:34,239
Rym: Yeah without being convoluted or complicated or messy covers to Basically completely separate storylines only linked by the fact that they happen to the same person in Very different time period.

266
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:35,690
Scott: it covers way more than two story.

267
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:38,322
Rym: I mean it covers like so much and I mean it is.

268
00:14:38,342 --> 00:14:39,930
Rym: so what is those two storylines?

269
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:42,258
Scott: But there's also just so much subject matter.

270
00:14:42,378 --> 00:14:43,783
Scott: Yes, right that's covered.

271
00:14:43,964 --> 00:14:48,257
Rym: I think part of that is that the subject matter is Hinted at or given to you like.

272
00:14:48,398 --> 00:14:51,650
Rym: there'll be one short paragraph that describes one tiny thing.

273
00:14:52,172 --> 00:14:57,010
Rym: But what that tiny thing implies is a gigantic story all on its own, right?

274
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,132
Scott: So you got.

275
00:14:58,413 --> 00:15:01,182
Scott: you got the post-apocalypse thing, which I guess, you know nerds love.

276
00:15:01,222 --> 00:15:02,446
Scott: Yeah, we did our.

277
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:03,028
Scott: what's the?

278
00:15:03,048 --> 00:15:03,510
Scott: what's the book?

279
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:03,811
Scott: We read.

280
00:15:04,012 --> 00:15:04,334
Scott: well, no.

281
00:15:05,058 --> 00:15:11,080
Scott: Well, there's wool and then the old one with the Can't can't.

282
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:19,493
Scott: Yeah, yeah Another one of those books in that post-apocalypse Genre, right.

283
00:15:19,734 --> 00:15:24,368
Scott: and then you bring in the UN play God sci-fi in the biology department up.

284
00:15:24,448 --> 00:15:31,890
Rym: you bring in Neoliberal crass consumerist dystopia of like a snow crash kind of world.

285
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:32,994
Rym: But I'm way worse.

286
00:15:33,034 --> 00:15:33,275
Rym: you get.

287
00:15:33,315 --> 00:15:40,850
Scott: well you get the cyberpunk of all this internet action going on right written from 2003 which explains some of the references, right?

288
00:15:41,672 --> 00:15:44,788
Scott: Yeah, that's you know, how much internet did they know in two thousand three?

289
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,667
Scott: It was a long goddamn time ahead of his time for two thousand three.

290
00:15:47,687 --> 00:15:54,334
Scott: Yeah You got like love stories like Gennaro Love story.

291
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:58,830
Rym: that's very pointedly told only from one character's perspective and that's very important.

292
00:15:59,151 --> 00:16:01,521
Scott: But you all but it's actually you're getting to love stories.

293
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:03,790
Scott: You're getting teenage love story and adult love story.

294
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:05,456
Scott: Yeah together, right?

295
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:13,124
Scott: You're getting addressing all sorts of societal Subject matters primarily neoliberalism, I think right?

296
00:16:13,164 --> 00:16:20,607
Scott: Well, you know, you got the the rich Suburb Walden corporate places and then you know the partying or caves and the pleblins.

297
00:16:20,747 --> 00:16:21,670
Scott: Yeah pretty much.

298
00:16:23,571 --> 00:16:24,894
Rym: Also, you've got the.

299
00:16:24,974 --> 00:16:31,831
Rym: the super secret cable channel from player of games is the basic broadcast TV in this world Mm-hmm.

300
00:16:32,353 --> 00:16:34,984
Scott: There's the and of course in the post-apocalypse world.

301
00:16:35,004 --> 00:16:48,969
Rym: You've got a whole other thing going on You know and you've got the plot of the second half of the Dominion tank police OAV Which you can only actually figure out if you read the manga because the anime shows it to you but doesn't explain it.

302
00:16:49,311 --> 00:16:53,043
Scott: Well, it's got like a little bit of Lord of the Flies going on little bit.

303
00:16:53,103 --> 00:16:55,209
Rym: if the Lord of the Flies ended way better.

304
00:16:56,471 --> 00:16:58,788
Scott: Sure, right, you know, it's like you got.

305
00:16:58,808 --> 00:16:59,472
Scott: you know It's.

306
00:16:59,612 --> 00:17:04,369
Scott: it's so much happening in this one little bit of culture going on and it's only one of three books.

307
00:17:04,756 --> 00:17:11,734
Rym: yeah, so We're gonna spoil the fuck out of this book and it's really short and you should just read it because it's a really really well Written book like.

308
00:17:11,775 --> 00:17:13,810
Rym: I can't recommend it enough if you listen to GeekNights.

309
00:17:14,453 --> 00:17:15,497
Rym: You would like this book.

310
00:17:15,718 --> 00:17:18,449
Rym: unless you guys can't read then get an audiobook.

311
00:17:18,911 --> 00:17:20,396
Scott: So I'm sure it's an audio book.

312
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:25,355
Rym: I mean Margaret Atwood is a respected and well-known author for a reason and this book Is worth reading.

313
00:17:25,877 --> 00:17:31,588
Rym: and from this point forward if you're not convinced by everything we just said We're just gonna assume that you read it and we're gonna talk about it.

314
00:17:33,278 --> 00:17:33,847
Rym: And here we go.

315
00:17:34,955 --> 00:17:36,974
Rym: so Where to begin?

316
00:17:37,376 --> 00:17:39,343
Scott: so the title of the book is Oryx and Craig.

317
00:17:39,524 --> 00:17:43,738
Scott: Yeah, which is like the most Not even trying to hide it.

318
00:17:44,059 --> 00:17:47,430
Scott: Adam and Eve kind of symbolism that has ever been done.

319
00:17:47,751 --> 00:17:48,935
Scott: Yeah, it's like there's.

320
00:17:48,995 --> 00:17:50,059
Scott: no I think that's.

321
00:17:50,099 --> 00:17:59,283
Scott: the only flaw I could find in the book is that all of its Messages were not subtle like nothing was like clever or like hidden.

322
00:17:59,303 --> 00:18:01,849
Scott: It was just like here I am.

323
00:18:03,192 --> 00:18:10,362
Rym: So it wasn't a sense though because it was the story of Someone who didn't pick up on all those clues.

324
00:18:10,482 --> 00:18:12,810
Scott: Yeah, but the reader is way smarter than Jimmy.

325
00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:13,875
Rym: Yeah, but that's it.

326
00:18:13,935 --> 00:18:26,190
Rym: you you the the person who has the wider perspective Living for in your ivory tower reading this book with its attached Elegance will read it and you see all the things that Jimmy doesn't see.

327
00:18:26,451 --> 00:18:31,055
Scott: Yeah, you see where this is guys like there's a chapter where they basically I think Were.

328
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:39,509
Scott: they reveal that like Craig made the Craig people literally, but it's like I knew that like three chapters in.

329
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:44,205
Scott: well Yeah, they even call some crackers right, but it's like it's like they don't explore.

330
00:18:44,245 --> 00:18:47,629
Rym: I was suspecting in the beginning I wasn't sure before you met Oryx.

331
00:18:48,372 --> 00:18:54,883
Rym: It was possible that Oryx or Craig might have been the creator Because we didn't really know like from.

332
00:18:55,044 --> 00:19:03,838
Scott: for all we knew well And maybe Oryx was gonna be a different scientist once they revealed that you know Craig was like a smart You know going to study at the place.

333
00:19:03,918 --> 00:19:04,661
Scott: I was like, oh, yeah.

334
00:19:04,841 --> 00:19:05,162
Scott: Okay.

335
00:19:05,363 --> 00:19:07,230
Scott: Now I understand did the crackers, right?

336
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:12,731
Scott: Yeah, but Oryx where I figured out Oryx like this mystery for so long Right.

337
00:19:13,013 --> 00:19:14,559
Scott: It's like, you know and even in the end.

338
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:18,898
Scott: It's like you don't really know, you know like her whole deal Yeah, which is sort of on like.

339
00:19:18,979 --> 00:19:20,790
Scott: was she really that girl from the video?

340
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:21,732
Scott: Probably not.

341
00:19:21,792 --> 00:19:31,373
Rym: Maybe it doesn't because remember the descriptions of her everything relating to her and in Craig and everything is from Jimmy's perspective pretty much Everything.

342
00:19:31,634 --> 00:19:36,330
Rym: every single thing is Jimmy's perspective not any sort of other.

343
00:19:36,611 --> 00:19:44,561
Rym: There's no other perspective left and Jimmy is yep, and Jimmy is uh Sort of I think he described himself best remember doesn't?

344
00:19:44,581 --> 00:19:54,810
Rym: he say that if he'd been born in the pleb lands go to a public He would have been a shining star but instead he's like the barely acceptable bare minimum of the elite society.

345
00:19:55,151 --> 00:19:56,315
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know, he's.

346
00:19:56,697 --> 00:19:59,487
Scott: I think that's why you know, he may eat the.

347
00:19:59,627 --> 00:20:01,173
Scott: he's a great, you know Main character.

348
00:20:01,213 --> 00:20:02,919
Scott: right because you're none of them.

349
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,204
Scott: No one who's a reader, right?

350
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:05,690
Scott: We're all pleb lands people.

351
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:07,342
Rym: Yeah, neither out as much as I'd like to say it.

352
00:20:07,382 --> 00:20:08,390
Rym: Neither one of us is Craig.

353
00:20:08,811 --> 00:20:11,380
Scott: Everyone reading is a pleb lands person, right?

354
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,467
Scott: all the real-world people like us.

355
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:16,409
Rym: if you think you're crazy Read crime and punish you can't out of Roscoe.

356
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,770
Rym: Well, I guess you could be a Roskalnikov.

357
00:20:18,011 --> 00:20:21,848
Scott: You can't go into this book with the perspective of.

358
00:20:21,928 --> 00:20:26,226
Scott: you know No one likes to write books from a perspective of like the God narrator.

359
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:27,210
Scott: not a character anymore.

360
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:33,390
Scott: That's so out of style right, you know, or the it gives the unreliable narrators in style, but even then that's usually a character.

361
00:20:33,571 --> 00:20:42,555
Scott: Yeah, I like the earnest but possibly uninformed or naive narrator Sure, but the only character that we can relate to in this whole story is Jimmy.

362
00:20:42,656 --> 00:20:48,136
Scott: right because the Crakers are not really people They're from yet in a way.

363
00:20:48,176 --> 00:20:49,983
Scott: they are and they are but they don't.

364
00:20:50,023 --> 00:20:50,284
Scott: they're not.

365
00:20:50,304 --> 00:20:51,689
Scott: we can't relate to them on any like.

366
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:56,468
Scott: they Don't have a society Basically aliens, right but the book sets up this whole thing of.

367
00:20:57,851 --> 00:20:59,478
Rym: Craig manufactured the apocalypse to.

368
00:20:59,498 --> 00:21:00,362
Rym: why have a clean slate?

369
00:21:00,402 --> 00:21:00,964
Rym: wipe everything out.

370
00:21:00,985 --> 00:21:16,090
Rym: He had the perfect plan and the reason for that was arguably because all the people who had had all these plans up to this point were me and play God's situation and There were increasingly adverse consequences of the science and that we had to get away from all these problems.

371
00:21:16,793 --> 00:21:20,810
Rym: But yet he fell into the same trap because he was a product of the society that had those problems.

372
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,174
Rym: So he had the.

373
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:27,590
Rym: his perfect plan was just as perfect as all the other perfect plans of that crass and horrible society.

374
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:28,418
Scott: That's his words.

375
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:28,963
Rym: Yeah.

376
00:21:29,225 --> 00:21:29,670
Rym: No, it didn't.

377
00:21:31,551 --> 00:21:33,095
Scott: The pig ooh, we didn't get them all.

378
00:21:33,275 --> 00:21:36,784
Rym: the pigoons are gonna literally be the 1984 pigs pretty much.

379
00:21:37,205 --> 00:21:43,062
Rym: and the Crakers already figured Religion and we're already learning and we're already kind of shaking their head at snowman.

380
00:21:43,102 --> 00:21:43,864
Rym: Like alright guy.

381
00:21:43,884 --> 00:21:44,947
Rym: Yeah, we're smart.

382
00:21:44,967 --> 00:21:45,870
Rym: We figured stuff out.

383
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:48,510
Rym: We're not that dumb and there's humans still alive.

384
00:21:48,911 --> 00:21:57,116
Rym: But think about that Craig what decided that this highly advanced society was playing God and to per you know He had all these reasons.

385
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:59,090
Scott: Well, yeah, it wasn't the great society at all.

386
00:21:59,110 --> 00:21:59,392
Scott: It could.

387
00:21:59,432 --> 00:22:02,429
Scott: he definitely used to shake it up, but he thought he was smarter than them.

388
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:08,234
Scott: And he felt but because I was smart of them, but he wasn't, you know, well, yeah nobody's perfect But he made this.

389
00:22:08,394 --> 00:22:09,218
Rym: well, that's the problem.

390
00:22:09,238 --> 00:22:11,710
Rym: Yeah, he did the thing that only works if you're perfect.

391
00:22:11,993 --> 00:22:20,795
Rym: But because he was a product of that society He was just as flawed as the pigoons and the snacks and everything else along or the snacks Along the way.

392
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:23,604
Rym: So his plan was just as bad as theirs.

393
00:22:23,684 --> 00:22:25,733
Rym: It just had a lot more collateral damage Mm-hmm.

394
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:28,670
Scott: Well, you know, I guess you know if he's Adam, right?

395
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:31,630
Scott: It's like he's so smart cuz he ate from the tree of knowledge, right?

396
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:35,608
Scott: He was all smart, but it's like I kicked out a pair of dice with the sea, but it's like dude.

397
00:22:35,769 --> 00:22:37,455
Scott: Adam Did not do so.

398
00:22:37,496 --> 00:22:40,146
Scott: Well, I didn't just to one of his kids kill the other one.

399
00:22:40,186 --> 00:22:46,444
Scott: It's like Yeah, even with all that knowledge from Apple eating he had.

400
00:22:46,464 --> 00:23:00,213
Rym: but it's interesting because You have this world that you're not only just seeing it purely from Jimmy's perspective But you're seeing it only from the perspective of the people in the compounds Like you're seeing it from the perspective Yeah You don't.

401
00:23:00,313 --> 00:23:06,166
Scott: you don't learn too and really much at all about Pueblans except for like the few scenes where he goes to the Pueblans and check stuff out

402
00:23:06,227 --> 00:23:06,910
Rym: like you're told

403
00:23:07,632 --> 00:23:07,812
Scott: That

404
00:23:07,852 --> 00:23:15,110
Rym: the rest of the world it feels like when the book starts the entire world outside of these compounds is almost already post-apocalyptic.

405
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:20,679
Rym: But then you start to realize that That's just the perspective of those people like.

406
00:23:20,719 --> 00:23:22,887
Scott: it ain't great out there, but it's not that bad, right?

407
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:24,493
Scott: Well, I mean these are.

408
00:23:24,996 --> 00:23:27,889
Scott: it's weird that like everything almost everything in this book is.

409
00:23:28,351 --> 00:23:32,790
Scott: I'm not sure how much of it was, you know time wise before or after other things.

410
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:39,088
Scott: But for example, right in the 90s, I read spider-man 2099, which is basically cyberpunk spider-man.

411
00:23:39,108 --> 00:23:39,870
Scott: It's actually really good.

412
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:40,420
Scott: You should read it.

413
00:23:41,374 --> 00:23:42,464
Scott: It's a comic book obviously.

414
00:23:42,626 --> 00:23:49,425
Scott: Yeah and in spider-man 2099 Spider-man is it's basically it's in Nueva York.

415
00:23:49,787 --> 00:23:50,310
Scott: is the setting?

416
00:23:50,499 --> 00:24:00,640
Scott: Yeah Right and there's basically all the cars in Nueva York are hover cars that fly like above these maglev tracks That are above old New York.

417
00:24:01,081 --> 00:24:03,088
Scott: Nueva York is above old New York.

418
00:24:03,149 --> 00:24:05,822
Scott: physically It's this uptown and downtown.

419
00:24:05,842 --> 00:24:06,727
Rym: It's like New Detroit.

420
00:24:06,808 --> 00:24:08,432
Scott: And yes Right.

421
00:24:08,452 --> 00:24:19,710
Scott: So underneath the maglev tracks where the buildings that we currently live in are Located is the same thing as the pleb lands right and up above is where the evil corporate land, right?

422
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:27,550
Scott: It's like these cut, you know, so they've been it horizontally arranged in Oryx and Craig But it's the same deal right the pigoons and whatever.

423
00:24:27,651 --> 00:24:29,443
Scott: It's like dude and ghost in the shell.

424
00:24:29,463 --> 00:24:33,964
Scott: to man-machine interface Which I think came out about around the same time as this book.

425
00:24:34,084 --> 00:24:37,756
Rym: Actually this book was 2003. it was published.

426
00:24:37,796 --> 00:24:43,150
Scott: Yeah, I'm not sure when man-machine interface was written by You know Masamune Shiro.

427
00:24:43,411 --> 00:24:50,522
Scott: But the whole plot line if you can actually understand any of it revolves around Pigs that they're growing humans organs in and harvesting.

428
00:24:50,542 --> 00:24:52,310
Scott: but then well cuz that was a real-world thing.

429
00:24:52,431 --> 00:24:54,693
Rym: We were working on this ride Exactly, right.

430
00:24:55,115 --> 00:24:58,230
Scott: They're doing cyber shit with the pigs brains and whatever, right?

431
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:02,750
Scott: You know, so it's like a lot of all of these things in Oryx and Craig are exists.

432
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:03,473
Scott: It's like there's not.

433
00:25:03,513 --> 00:25:05,603
Rym: man-machine interface ran 91 to 97.

434
00:25:05,603 --> 00:25:07,090
Rym: It was actually pretty slow.

435
00:25:07,351 --> 00:25:09,850
Scott: I came out in I think the US around that time.

436
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:13,886
Rym: Yeah, cuz I was buying it original run September 91 to August 97.

437
00:25:13,886 --> 00:25:22,090
Rym: Anyway, I don't read that Unless you're brave Unless you're brave or you are that desperate for more ghosts in the show?

438
00:25:22,531 --> 00:25:23,879
Scott: You got to be super desperate like that.

439
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:26,372
Scott: You know, that's the last ghost in the show You should go.

440
00:25:26,392 --> 00:25:29,970
Rym: that's like Barney drinking the beer out of the cigarette tray.

441
00:25:30,232 --> 00:25:30,656
Scott: but it's weird.

442
00:25:30,676 --> 00:25:39,810
Scott: like I'm reading this book and every single thing in this book is Something that I had seen before in some other cyberpunk or some other sci-fi or some other something.

443
00:25:40,132 --> 00:25:47,450
Scott: well, like they say it's also an inversion though because yet By combining every single one of those things into one book is completely new.

444
00:25:47,811 --> 00:26:00,323
Rym: So here's the inversion that I noticed in like snow crash and those kinds of you know We're like burb claves and all that stuff the crass Consumerism so chipper typified by things called like chicky nubs and soy.

445
00:26:00,363 --> 00:26:02,910
Scott: Oh boy fries or whatever a little fallout action going on.

446
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:16,687
Rym: Yeah like all that shit in those worlds is aimed at the crass middle-class plebeian like sort of Non-interactive non-important people and the elites have this so much different world Began in this book.

447
00:26:17,331 --> 00:26:30,020
Rym: The oh that is are the ones creating and consuming those things and the pleb lands while they are like You don't really get to see but like there's the moment where he's going to the university That's kind of closer to pleb land.

448
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,588
Rym: Like it's it's like a real university.

449
00:26:31,628 --> 00:26:33,274
Rym: still I never has humanities.

450
00:26:33,515 --> 00:26:39,097
Rym: and remember he brings the chicky knobs home because he's an elite and he gets chicky knobs and they're like What the fuck dude?

451
00:26:39,358 --> 00:26:50,719
Scott: Yeah, then actually, you know, that is interesting I didn't ever thought of it that you know because it's like, you know These sort of fake silly products or trope that are in everything and they're always aimed at like, you know I'll buy for a dollar.

452
00:26:50,779 --> 00:26:51,909
Rym: that's a shit people.

453
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:55,444
Scott: Well some I think that's you know, the one in the ones you're thinking of.

454
00:26:55,484 --> 00:26:55,765
Scott: Yes.

455
00:26:55,825 --> 00:26:57,090
Scott: They are aimed at the shit people.

456
00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:03,836
Scott: Right the shit people The lower class, you know They're usually in those works shit.

457
00:27:03,896 --> 00:27:06,022
Rym: relative to the narrative of the story the

458
00:27:06,162 --> 00:27:24,454
Scott: upper-class people the people running the society are manufacturing this garbage right, you know obey whatever and Foisting it on the lower classes and they're living it up with the good shit, right the real stuff You know, but the original real deal and brave new world That's not how it is.

459
00:27:24,494 --> 00:27:31,661
Scott: and brave new world the upper-class people who live in the brave new society are the ones with the the Feelies and the soma and all the good shit.

460
00:27:31,742 --> 00:27:36,100
Scott: Yeah, and the people who live in the sticks It's that's a lot more similar to the Oryx and Craig's.

461
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:47,950
Rym: but I like how this one combines the like Ultra crass Chicken surprise level product names with the inversion of those are the products that are also marketed at the high-end elites.

462
00:27:48,271 --> 00:27:50,100
Rym: And there's the point where he becomes the ad man.

463
00:27:50,562 --> 00:27:59,173
Rym: for you know, the obviously fake shit Yeah, and yet he starts using it anyway, and he even notes like I guess I fell for my own Shit,

464
00:27:59,213 --> 00:28:05,190
Scott: but I mean the other thing is that some of it's it's almost did we fall for those ads because actually I think chicken

465
00:28:05,531 --> 00:28:05,993
Rym: Kind of good.

466
00:28:06,154 --> 00:28:07,278
Rym: Yeah, I actually it's interesting.

467
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:10,170
Scott: I haven't eaten any but it's like they don't seem bad to me.

468
00:28:10,391 --> 00:28:17,780
Rym: Well because look at the new Craig is the Hannibal Lecter Transhumanist like sociopath right and Jimmy is the normal person.

469
00:28:18,081 --> 00:28:25,509
Rym: normal people are revolted by chicken knobs because that Terrifies some very base sensibility of humanity and our culture.

470
00:28:26,072 --> 00:28:30,610
Rym: But yet from a more from a distance you say I'm a sociopath because I like chicken.

471
00:28:30,971 --> 00:28:35,550
Rym: I'm saying from a more dispassionate or literate or objective frame of reference.

472
00:28:35,811 --> 00:28:37,797
Rym: I say more because there is no objective frame of reference.

473
00:28:38,158 --> 00:28:42,030
Rym: even the judging eye is not an objective reference because it's still dams whores.

474
00:28:42,334 --> 00:28:46,382
Scott: but I digress But I think it dams everyone is it there's?

475
00:28:46,462 --> 00:28:47,830
Scott: anyone had seen that hasn't been named?

476
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:57,973
Rym: Uh, it did not damn the tears of God and I don't think she was damaged looked at herself I don't know anyway But Craig is the one who you know That level.

477
00:28:58,013 --> 00:29:06,454
Rym: the transhumanist side looks at cheeky knobs and says this is an objective improvement that objectively reduces the amount of suffering of Thinking beings in the world.

478
00:29:06,474 --> 00:29:06,855
Rym: Mm-hmm.

479
00:29:06,976 --> 00:29:07,477
Rym: Good game.

480
00:29:07,758 --> 00:29:11,630
Rym: Yeah, so the pagoons are way worse because they're putting human brains in them.

481
00:29:11,911 --> 00:29:15,826
Rym: Yeah, but the cheeky knobs, I hope cheeky knobs exist someday.

482
00:29:15,846 --> 00:29:26,043
Scott: Yeah It's like it's the the whore the thing that appears already at the point where if I get the imitation General so's chicken from the vegan place.

483
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,210
Scott: It tastes very good.

484
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:28,717
Scott: It tastes better than the general.

485
00:29:28,737 --> 00:29:34,159
Scott: so chicken from the not the from the average Chinese place Obviously go to the fancy Chinese, you know, yeah, right.

486
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:37,806
Scott: I mean, you're probably not getting general so's chicken at the fancy Chinese place Are you yeah?

487
00:29:39,395 --> 00:29:41,770
Rym: I can't get a burger made from fake meat yet.

488
00:29:44,891 --> 00:29:45,774
Scott: Yeah, but it won't.

489
00:29:46,235 --> 00:29:47,178
Rym: it won't be there it's not.

490
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:49,023
Scott: it doesn't taste like what you want.

491
00:29:49,063 --> 00:29:51,089
Rym: a cheeky knobs sound pretty good actually.

492
00:29:51,329 --> 00:30:02,459
Scott: yeah Especially if it's fried because mostly you eat fried chicken for the fried not for the chicken but on one hand Great something to fry cuz remember we don't get Kirk's Craig's perspective We just see him through the lens of Jimmy.

493
00:30:02,841 --> 00:30:10,730
Rym: Craig goes on and on about how you know This Malthusian nonsense that we're at, you know overpopulation is going to destroy the earth and blah blah blah blah.

494
00:30:11,512 --> 00:30:19,656
Rym: But at the same time you see that all the technology they're using pretty much everywhere that they can especially in the compounds It's all solar-powered.

495
00:30:19,696 --> 00:30:23,488
Rym: like they have moved toward green energy for everywhere that they can.

496
00:30:23,508 --> 00:30:25,999
Rym: and How much?

497
00:30:26,281 --> 00:30:27,389
Rym: because you know in the modern world?

498
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:32,801
Rym: Malthusian economics and Malthusian stuff is pretty deeply discredited.

499
00:30:32,821 --> 00:30:53,202
Rym: and the idea that the only way to constrain a rapidly growing human population as mass starvation or disasters was discredited by the As his rationale for fucking murdering everybody well, I think you know, he doesn't.

500
00:30:53,784 --> 00:30:54,466
Scott: Jimmy never knows.

501
00:30:54,506 --> 00:30:55,790
Scott: that's gonna happen until it happens.

502
00:30:57,155 --> 00:31:00,005
Scott: So it's not like you needed to see a rationale for it's a late.

503
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:09,816
Rym: I Gotcha, I wasn't sure just from the beginning if Oryx or Craig was going to be the one to do it until The second relative of Craig's died.

504
00:31:09,836 --> 00:31:15,698
Rym: and then I was like well Craig is the kid from that story about the poisoning kid Mm-hmm, like straight up.

505
00:31:15,738 --> 00:31:17,710
Rym: He's murdering people practicing testing it.

506
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:21,303
Scott: Well, cuz it's his you know, his own dad got pushed off the thing, right?

507
00:31:21,384 --> 00:31:26,916
Rym: Yeah, I left the bridge or whatever but Craig Was pretty much like there.

508
00:31:27,358 --> 00:31:30,308
Rym: every indication to me is that Craig was wrong?

509
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:44,790
Rym: Objectively bad failed and like this story is about just this psychotic person Getting the power to do his psychotic thing and kill everybody and that all the justification is Probably pretty flimsy.

510
00:31:46,491 --> 00:31:48,580
Scott: Yeah, I don't think there's any justification.

511
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:54,710
Rym: Yeah now at the same time we are in a world I mean, he was so close to flood it was so smart and so powerful, right?

512
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:58,979
Scott: He easily could have you know Shaken things up in a less ridiculous way.

513
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:08,010
Scott: actually if he'd gone with his that the plan that he was faking Like he could have just become like in charge of the whole company and then stopped being evil because he's in charge of all right now.

514
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:13,749
Rym: He made Soma like he could have just turned into that and then instead nope Soma kills people.

515
00:32:14,071 --> 00:32:15,658
Rym: Mm-hmm, like his plan.

516
00:32:15,879 --> 00:32:20,779
Rym: his first plan was way better than his second plan And even the designer babies.

517
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:26,310
Rym: that would have been the kind of thing where the designer babies just replace real humans And eventually it's just crackers walking around, right?

518
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:28,179
Scott: Well, that's part of the overpopulation thing right?

519
00:32:28,259 --> 00:32:28,299
Scott: is?

520
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:36,690
Scott: people, you know, at least the people who had access I weren't dying so much Unless they were murdered by corruption, but you know see we're not dying so much.

521
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:46,975
Rym: But at the same time we know that this was definitely a neoliberal dystopia because climate change has fucked the world pretty badly and The it's always warm all the time.

522
00:32:47,055 --> 00:32:47,857
Scott: Everything's tropical.

523
00:32:47,877 --> 00:32:55,827
Rym: Yep, and the corpse are Making horrific diseases and using them to wage corporate warfare shadowrun style.

524
00:32:55,847 --> 00:32:56,248
Rym: Mm-hmm.

525
00:32:56,529 --> 00:33:03,770
Rym: So All those medicines are always flawed on purpose and like none of that stuff is a hundred percent effective.

526
00:33:04,131 --> 00:33:08,389
Rym: so those people aren't actually immortal and like that stuff is actually not working out so great.

527
00:33:08,409 --> 00:33:12,121
Rym: and You also get this impression that it's not the.

528
00:33:12,422 --> 00:33:14,330
Rym: the advanced technology is not the problem.

529
00:33:14,411 --> 00:33:16,050
Rym: The I am play God is not the problem.

530
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:22,149
Rym: the problem is that the I am like God is deeply fettered to this capitalist neoliberal society.

531
00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:27,108
Rym: and It might have been it would have been great if that had been run by some sort of government I guess.

532
00:33:28,892 --> 00:33:30,825
Scott: Or you know anyone who is not evil.

533
00:33:30,845 --> 00:33:35,341
Rym: Yeah Pretty much Craig just got way too much power though.

534
00:33:35,963 --> 00:33:45,810
Rym: So here's a question Scott did Craig create when he was young the extinct a thon thing and Use that to recruit people or did he find it and take it over?

535
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:48,910
Scott: No, someone else made it because it was older than he was right?

536
00:33:48,950 --> 00:34:04,102
Rym: It's like, you know, but we only know this from Jimmy and I'm pretty sure Craig introduced it to Jimmy as a game I. But I'm just curious what are your thoughts are cuz?

537
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:05,950
Rym: I can justify both pretty easily.

538
00:34:06,111 --> 00:34:10,504
Scott: I mean, yes something that's not specified and doesn't matter doesn't you know, it's like you can.

539
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:14,456
Scott: obviously it could be either way Which is a big part of Oryx's character.

540
00:34:14,496 --> 00:34:18,469
Rym: cuz look every time Jimmy fries into her past her answer is always that's stupid.

541
00:34:19,014 --> 00:34:19,780
Rym: Why do you care?

542
00:34:20,143 --> 00:34:20,909
Rym: How does this matter?

543
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:27,773
Rym: Mm-hmm, which is extra interesting because now he is doing the same thing to the crackers like he's trying to.

544
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:30,889
Rym: just he doesn't even want to tell them about what came before because he's like.

545
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:33,329
Scott: It literally doesn't matter and it also will mess you up.

546
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:37,248
Scott: It'll mess you up and you'll just ask me a bunch of stupid questions, then I won't be able to shut you up.

547
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:39,716
Scott: Yeah, it's like stop asking me all this dumb shit.

548
00:34:40,098 --> 00:34:47,456
Rym: Does he act that way because she acted that way to Make him that way so he would do his job.

549
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:53,407
Scott: You ever wonder about you know, they're actually, you know, usually you think right like You know.

550
00:34:54,393 --> 00:35:11,950
Scott: Like in the real world, you know All these religious explanations for things and there's generally this sort of pop mostly false idea that like oh, yeah you know in the olden days the religious leaders were just the only smart people and They would tell people stuff like yeah, don't eat pig.

551
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:16,090
Rym: Why are you thinking the religious people just wanted people around to shut up and stop bothering them, right?

552
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:22,418
Scott: Cuz God will because God will punish you because they don't want to explain that like, you know, yeah It's it's gonna be gonna get sick.

553
00:35:22,478 --> 00:35:27,192
Scott: Why the taste delicious, you know, yeah Is that why we have Religion?

554
00:35:27,252 --> 00:35:32,330
Scott: because someone tried to explain things to dumb people and didn't want to have to sit there and give a real explanation.

555
00:35:32,571 --> 00:35:38,098
Rym: But it is relevant to the the whole, you know, the past doesn't matter or what came before Doesn't affect you.

556
00:35:38,138 --> 00:35:41,775
Scott: In fact knowing it might mess you up It's like if I was the girl in the video.

557
00:35:41,956 --> 00:35:42,718
Scott: or why wasn't?

558
00:35:42,878 --> 00:35:44,242
Scott: it doesn't matter, right?

559
00:35:44,462 --> 00:35:47,605
Rym: It'll change your opinion for no reason Yep.

560
00:35:49,171 --> 00:35:51,703
Rym: But remember way back when we did our final thoughts.

561
00:35:52,065 --> 00:35:52,909
Rym: I just thought of this big.

562
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:54,469
Rym: Oh Remember that show.

563
00:35:55,191 --> 00:36:03,229
Rym: yeah, so a big theme in Big O is whether or not the past before everyone lost their memories matters at all.

564
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:05,870
Rym: like Does it matter the orange because?

565
00:36:06,771 --> 00:36:07,574
Scott: Never doesn't it right?

566
00:36:07,614 --> 00:36:09,422
Scott: That's a lot of apocalypses.

567
00:36:09,503 --> 00:36:24,870
Scott: Don't I mean, I guess the The Leibovitz one does and so does Eric's and Craig That the previous one causes the next one forever right but a lot of post apocalypses say like fisted the North Star.

568
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:33,690
Scott: Yeah It's like no people Haven't forgotten what happened before because the people living and the people in the store It's like not enough people died in those apocalypses.

569
00:36:34,011 --> 00:36:39,130
Scott: So they're all walking around and all the adults remember the world before the apocalypse because they lived through it.

570
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:47,290
Rym: Well, they're also all set in worlds where there's no possibility of reclaiming a better world So they only have the opportunity to make the same mistakes, right?

571
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:48,795
Scott: But here this is one where people have.

572
00:36:48,815 --> 00:36:53,130
Scott: you know, everything that came before was forgotten except by Jimmy at least in this book.

573
00:36:53,331 --> 00:36:57,210
Scott: Yeah, you know apparently I guess we're gonna see other people in other books who might remember.

574
00:36:57,351 --> 00:37:07,230
Scott: But the only person this book who remembers is the snowman Which is weird because like, you know, I'd even as like snowman like there's no snow anywhere the abominable snowman.

575
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:08,675
Scott: Well, it's in the myth, right?

576
00:37:08,695 --> 00:37:13,430
Scott: He's alluding to you know, the right the myth because of the global warming, right?

577
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:15,597
Scott: There are there's no snow or snowmen anymore.

578
00:37:15,617 --> 00:37:25,065
Scott: There isn't even a concept of snow, right but also his abominableness Right compared to you know, the people that he's you know, the crackers right.

579
00:37:25,467 --> 00:37:27,955
Scott: as far as compared to them He is definitely abominable.

580
00:37:28,076 --> 00:37:35,775
Rym: course notice how his mental state changes Rapidly bit depending on where he is When the book starts.

581
00:37:36,036 --> 00:37:37,903
Scott: well also based on the situation.

582
00:37:37,943 --> 00:37:46,002
Rym: He's in right but like he's without Society around him He's barely human and can't even form coherent thoughts.

583
00:37:46,404 --> 00:37:49,734
Rym: like he doesn't like he doesn't wear clothes or bathe He's kind of just this mess.

584
00:37:49,795 --> 00:37:56,650
Scott: He's just trying to basically survive, you know, he doesn't have you know The knowledge or instincts to survive in the wild or whatever.

585
00:37:56,650 --> 00:38:02,130
Rym: But as he slowly but he's also living a worse lifestyle than he could if he applied himself a little bit.

586
00:38:02,411 --> 00:38:10,879
Rym: But then as he returns and you get the impression that he makes this pilgrimage back to those places Semi-regularly and that the cycle just kept repeating until now.

587
00:38:11,019 --> 00:38:11,200
Scott: Yeah.

588
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,685
Scott: I mean, that's how he had alcohol.

589
00:38:12,745 --> 00:38:15,729
Rym: Yeah, but he Regresses when he's away.

590
00:38:16,112 --> 00:38:21,362
Rym: Eventually something drives him to go back and as he goes back He gets me gets more and more human and more and more cognizant.

591
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,150
Scott: He has to take care of the people.

592
00:38:23,432 --> 00:38:26,530
Rym: He makes plans he remembers and then he starts forgetting it all again.

593
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:31,910
Rym: Cuz when he goes back the first thing he does is he has a brain fart and he realizes he forgot to get a mirror.

594
00:38:32,931 --> 00:38:34,058
Rym: And it all just collapses.

595
00:38:34,098 --> 00:38:44,338
Rym: and you know that if those people hadn't been there He would have turned back into that basically scab just sitting on that rusty bed frame in the tree waiting You know just getting drunk doing nothing.

596
00:38:45,161 --> 00:38:49,315
Scott: I should have told him to bring me a fish every day three a day Not once a week.

597
00:38:49,355 --> 00:38:50,258
Scott: What are you seeing?

598
00:38:50,278 --> 00:38:51,863
Rym: steamed crabs, but the good kind.

599
00:38:52,064 --> 00:38:53,750
Scott: Yeah, but I won't let eat them eat me.

600
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:57,947
Scott: So you have to eat grass or whatever, you know, because that's how they're engineered and whatnot.

601
00:38:58,027 --> 00:39:02,729
Rym: Yep so Oryx was definitely not in on it.

602
00:39:03,891 --> 00:39:05,319
Scott: Well, I mean she says as much cuz.

603
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,826
Scott: she calls Jimmy on the phone.

604
00:39:06,846 --> 00:39:10,950
Scott: she's like, oh my god I didn't realize all those things that you know, and it didn't seem like she was lying.

605
00:39:11,372 --> 00:39:19,610
Rym: So if it was her in the video It makes sense that Craig either used her or got someone who looked like her.

606
00:39:20,771 --> 00:39:26,790
Rym: Like this was all Kella style engineered to put Jimmy in the right state of mind to do the things he wanted to do.

607
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:29,319
Rym: It's very much like a Prince of Nothing Kella situation.

608
00:39:29,339 --> 00:39:32,330
Scott: I think it could have been you know, but it didn't you know.

609
00:39:33,352 --> 00:39:43,470
Scott: how much was You know, I mean he definitely, you know did what he had to do to get Jimmy, you know to do it He needed yeah right up to but suicide by Jimmy.

610
00:39:43,731 --> 00:39:45,879
Scott: But it's like it, you know, did he like?

611
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:48,730
Scott: was Oryx a person that he genetically?

612
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,764
Scott: Manufactured and then put these memories in?

613
00:39:51,945 --> 00:39:53,433
Scott: it's like, you know It could have been any.

614
00:39:53,614 --> 00:39:54,136
Scott: it could have been.

615
00:39:54,156 --> 00:39:55,964
Scott: it also could it could?

616
00:39:56,004 --> 00:39:57,310
Scott: she could have been the person in the video.

617
00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:00,364
Scott: She could have just been a person who looked like the person in the van again.

618
00:40:00,385 --> 00:40:01,430
Rym: The question doesn't matter.

619
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:04,479
Rym: It's like, you know, but that's where we get the point.

620
00:40:04,499 --> 00:40:07,770
Scott: doesn't want all these details of like how isn't really important?

621
00:40:07,951 --> 00:40:15,829
Rym: Well one criticism I've seen of the book and almost every one of our friends who recommended the book has brought this up Is that Oryx is definitely treated as this?

622
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,514
Rym: Exotified feminine mystery.

623
00:40:18,815 --> 00:40:32,506
Rym: Yeah, but yet it is clearly from Jimmy's perspective and he is obsessed with her and That seems to be by Craig's design Like it's not a neutral view of her or anything.

624
00:40:32,848 --> 00:40:36,378
Rym: it's Craig's Projection of her through Jimmy's eyes, right?

625
00:40:36,398 --> 00:40:40,290
Scott: You don't see what she's doing when Jimmy's not around, right?

626
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:43,550
Scott: You don't know what her real deal is, you know completely.

627
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:52,369
Scott: you only know her deal as far as Jimmy is concerned and you know what the other character I think is the best character in the whole book is The same way which is Jimmy's mom.

628
00:40:52,620 --> 00:41:00,035
Scott: Yeah The only other major female character really and like Jimmy's mom is like the best but you only see her The way Jimmy sees her.

629
00:41:00,075 --> 00:41:06,574
Scott: when he's young he sees her as this, you know woman who's his mom is just a pain in the ass Ruining everything for him.

630
00:41:06,654 --> 00:41:12,890
Scott: Yeah, right and that like a bad mom and then later like this mysterious person that he sort of want.

631
00:41:12,951 --> 00:41:33,030
Scott: You know, it's like Simultaneously causing him problems because security keeps bothering him But also like he kind of wants to see her again or save her help her out because he understands it like oh my mom's actually Doing good now Right, imagine if Craig was like, you know hanging doing it Jimmy's mom's style right that it would be great.

632
00:41:33,331 --> 00:41:38,611
Rym: Yeah, maybe though because those people were still mostly Terrorists.

633
00:41:39,294 --> 00:41:40,540
Rym: at least that's the impression we get.

634
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,830
Rym: Yeah, but they were doing it on a lower scale.

635
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:46,067
Scott: Listen, if you're a terrorist and you're powerful enough that it works, right?

636
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:46,428
Scott: That's how.

637
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:51,570
Rym: But is there an argument to be made that that level of violence?

638
00:41:52,634 --> 00:41:56,242
Rym: Dangerous Murderous activism like it's just a sliding scale.

639
00:41:56,302 --> 00:41:58,010
Scott: It's less murderous than killing everybody.

640
00:41:58,795 --> 00:42:03,458
Rym: The ultimate form of that is literally kill everybody Mm-hmm.

641
00:42:03,478 --> 00:42:05,109
Scott: It's better than bioterrorism, right?

642
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:15,240
Rym: so another question is did Craig Specifically plan this to get Jimmy to kill him?

643
00:42:15,882 --> 00:42:18,070
Rym: or was that an accident of him being drunk?

644
00:42:19,019 --> 00:42:21,852
Scott: The killing at the end Kill Oryx.

645
00:42:22,233 --> 00:42:22,574
Rym: Sure.

646
00:42:22,594 --> 00:42:25,324
Rym: Jimmy remembers that and it's not likely that's a fabric.

647
00:42:25,364 --> 00:42:28,300
Scott: No, they were right there on the ground Yeah, where he left him, right?

648
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,469
Scott: Yeah, that was you know.

649
00:42:30,671 --> 00:42:38,193
Scott: See that I think partially was a literary device to avoid Like.

650
00:42:38,233 --> 00:42:43,549
Scott: yeah, I'm calling you out amazing author on your cop-out To avoid having to they might still be alive.

651
00:42:43,831 --> 00:42:51,099
Scott: Well, no to avoid having to write any sort of dialogue or further explanations after the head Like you, you know cuz like they.

652
00:42:51,159 --> 00:42:57,730
Scott: well they could have had a conversation there, you know Like, you know Craig spilling some beans or Oryx spilling some beans, right?

653
00:42:57,790 --> 00:42:57,972
Scott: It's like.

654
00:42:57,992 --> 00:42:59,750
Scott: well if they die, we don't have to spill any beans.

655
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:07,709
Scott: I read a different way cuz remember when but obviously, you know, it's like Why did he kill her right there?

656
00:43:08,832 --> 00:43:10,216
Rym: So I have a read on that.

657
00:43:10,537 --> 00:43:15,854
Rym: because when Craig when he finally when Jimmy finally got a hold of Craig while the war Well, the apocalypse was beginning.

658
00:43:15,894 --> 00:43:16,416
Scott: Did he know that?

659
00:43:16,476 --> 00:43:17,058
Scott: maybe he was.

660
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:18,523
Scott: you know that he was.

661
00:43:19,065 --> 00:43:21,172
Scott: Jimmy was taking the serum right to be Immune.

662
00:43:21,292 --> 00:43:27,881
Scott: Yeah, maybe he wasn't in Oryx wasn't and he knew that like he did that on purpose He just he shot.

663
00:43:28,062 --> 00:43:34,850
Scott: he shot her Cuz - cuz he knew then they would have he would avoid having to suffer from the disease and I think I ran away.

664
00:43:35,051 --> 00:43:36,416
Rym: I think it's much more specific.

665
00:43:36,456 --> 00:43:38,103
Scott: So and there was no one left to shoot him.

666
00:43:38,786 --> 00:43:44,854
Rym: It's possible Jimmy Just remember he called he talks to Jimmy and he's drunk Which is odd.

667
00:43:44,874 --> 00:43:48,123
Scott: He's not a person who gets drunk and he's acting differently.

668
00:43:48,825 --> 00:43:58,350
Rym: So a common thing among People who attempt suicide in the real world and survive is that they're very motivated to do the thing.

669
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:11,890
Rym: But once they begin the action they very often have second thoughts and that's why guns are such a problem and Caused such a high rate of suicide because once you start the action, you're already over the threshold and it's too late.

670
00:44:13,051 --> 00:44:30,450
Rym: So I feel like Craig even at that juncture Regretted what he'd done or feared that he was starting to regret it was worried that he would back out and basically Killed her to commit suicide by Jimmy's gun to make sure that he could not back away from what he started.

671
00:44:30,871 --> 00:44:32,116
Scott: Oh, maybe maybe it was just.

672
00:44:32,317 --> 00:44:35,709
Scott: he did it right and at you know, it's like, you know, he was so sure of it.

673
00:44:35,911 --> 00:44:39,782
Scott: Yep, and then it wasn't After he after he killed the whole world.

674
00:44:39,822 --> 00:44:40,866
Scott: He actually felt guilty.

675
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:43,619
Rym: It was like oh shit I don't think it's even guilt cuz at that.

676
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:44,242
Scott: Oh shit.

677
00:44:44,302 --> 00:44:44,925
Scott: I fucked up.

678
00:44:44,945 --> 00:44:47,381
Scott: I Can't really live with myself.

679
00:44:47,401 --> 00:44:52,910
Rym: at that point He probably could have gotten the vaccine out and started to like save people.

680
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:56,183
Rym: It's because I was still pretty early when he got back to the facility.

681
00:44:56,765 --> 00:44:58,090
Rym: So I'm free.

682
00:44:58,251 --> 00:45:06,494
Rym: I suspect that was him making sure that he could not stop it because he He's alive.

683
00:45:06,554 --> 00:45:10,529
Scott: then somebody could like force him to save the world again undo it or he might have.

684
00:45:10,549 --> 00:45:19,886
Rym: you know He seems like the kind of person who logically was sure of what he did But he was worried that his fragile human brain might feel guilt and undo it on him himself.

685
00:45:20,167 --> 00:45:21,010
Scott: Yeah, something like that.

686
00:45:21,332 --> 00:45:21,714
Rym: I feel like.

687
00:45:21,734 --> 00:45:24,230
Scott: that's what was plenty of reasonable explanations there.

688
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:26,076
Rym: That's the best I could come up with.

689
00:45:26,176 --> 00:45:28,705
Rym: everything else was hinky or crazy or didn't really fit.

690
00:45:29,026 --> 00:45:35,545
Scott: Yeah Also so that their corpses could conveniently be there when you know, Jimmy goes back right?

691
00:45:35,685 --> 00:45:35,926
Rym: Yeah.

692
00:45:36,307 --> 00:45:36,447
Rym: Yeah.

693
00:45:38,251 --> 00:45:42,865
Rym: Otherwise, I mean, I really like this book and I like the ending because it's sort of did.

694
00:45:43,266 --> 00:45:47,560
Rym: it very elegantly says You know Craig's was you know, Craig was wrong and everything's.

695
00:45:47,821 --> 00:45:49,025
Rym: the world just keeps progressing.

696
00:45:49,066 --> 00:45:50,330
Rym: things was different, right?

697
00:45:50,370 --> 00:46:00,948
Scott: Cuz up until you know, it's like yeah, you know up until like the very end part It seems like everything Craig wanted to happen is happening like his design is perfect.

698
00:46:00,988 --> 00:46:03,095
Scott: design You know is into.

699
00:46:03,155 --> 00:46:08,873
Scott: his intelligent design has come to fruition exactly as planned and then at the end of the book They're like, actually it didn't.

700
00:46:09,315 --> 00:46:12,868
Rym: so there was a scene when he's leaving the crackers to go do the thing where?

701
00:46:14,093 --> 00:46:24,797
Rym: The the kids keep asking him shit and he's kind of getting flummoxed and you know starting to fumble over his lies a little bit and the adult crackers sort of Shake their heads and just get the kids to shut up.

702
00:46:24,857 --> 00:46:33,877
Rym: and it's implied that the old old crackers even then are Way more aware of what's going on then they necessarily let on to snowman.

703
00:46:34,178 --> 00:46:40,523
Rym: Yeah, like snowman is Treating them like babies and they're actually they figured more out than he realizes.

704
00:46:40,804 --> 00:46:45,079
Scott: Well, you know, they're also partially like, all right Let's not upset the crazy old man in the woods.

705
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:47,429
Scott: Yeah, you know, he's actually somewhat useful.

706
00:46:48,431 --> 00:46:49,736
Rym: Also, we feel bad for him.

707
00:46:49,876 --> 00:46:53,550
Rym: Yeah, you know cuz they're like, oh, yeah some other people like you came.

708
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:55,238
Rym: So we're like, whatever they're right over there.

709
00:46:55,258 --> 00:46:56,645
Rym: You wanna go talk to him?

710
00:46:57,228 --> 00:47:09,403
Rym: Yeah But the fact at the end too that now he is this monster on the like outside of the vision Yeah, an abominable monster with a gun and he's thinking to himself.

711
00:47:09,724 --> 00:47:10,706
Rym: Should I just kill him all?

712
00:47:11,168 --> 00:47:11,750
Rym: what do I do?

713
00:47:12,392 --> 00:47:13,756
Rym: And the fact that who are the?

714
00:47:13,796 --> 00:47:18,670
Scott: I don't know anything about this be yeah humanity is the same after the apocalypse.

715
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:28,344
Scott: Well, I think the other it's like he is so close to knowing about the apocalypse more than anyone ever Like, you know, like anyone he meets knows nothing.

716
00:47:28,364 --> 00:47:29,088
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

717
00:47:30,012 --> 00:47:32,884
Scott: You know if he hangs out with anyone it's like.

718
00:47:33,166 --> 00:47:34,130
Scott: will they find out?

719
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:34,973
Scott: What will they learn?

720
00:47:34,993 --> 00:47:37,624
Scott: just like being near him is like how much can he hide?

721
00:47:37,644 --> 00:47:38,468
Scott: it's like they're gonna.

722
00:47:38,488 --> 00:47:42,450
Scott: you know Already those people already met the crackers and we're like what the hell is up with these people.

723
00:47:42,450 --> 00:47:42,973
Scott: Where did they go?

724
00:47:43,013 --> 00:47:46,550
Rym: Yeah, you know Chris remember to all the smart people inside of the facility.

725
00:47:46,610 --> 00:47:52,504
Rym: He locked them out when if he'd kept them in they could have been an asset or valuable possibly.

726
00:47:52,845 --> 00:47:59,687
Scott: maybe maybe they didn't all die Necessarily, I mean most of them did probably but it's possible that more than one of them is still alive.

727
00:47:59,949 --> 00:48:03,039
Rym: Yep or I mean - and people speaking in Russian.

728
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:09,050
Rym: so it's clear that there are Probably Significant numbers of humans out somewhere.

729
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:13,210
Scott: Doing it was not a complete world extinction.

730
00:48:13,992 --> 00:48:23,361
