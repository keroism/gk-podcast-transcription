00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,649
Rym: It's Thursday, June 29th, 2016.

2
00:00:11,649 --> 00:00:13,053
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,554 --> 00:00:20,418
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight The Lost Village anime that well, it's an anime.

4
00:00:20,438 --> 00:00:23,397
Rym: All right Let's do this.

5
00:00:26,544 --> 00:00:27,959
Rym: Well, it was about that time of year.

6
00:00:28,427 --> 00:00:35,891
Rym: so I Started doing the thing that I do every few months and I changed all my passwords and I had a few like shit accounts that I hadn't really bothered with for a while.

7
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:47,500
Rym: So I basically did the password Two-factor everything refresh off everything I got, you know to be honest Like I keep bothering other people about like their passwords and you haven't changed your passwords in years.

8
00:00:47,561 --> 00:00:49,860
Scott: Have you all the ones that have two-factor?

9
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:58,598
Scott: I trust the two-factor too much and I don't change the passwords that often but they are really really good password Yep, so actually what I did is I because you know what?

10
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,851
Rym: I usually do that the best when I have it.

11
00:01:00,972 --> 00:01:02,340
Scott: also I am very good.

12
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,269
Scott: I have a different password for everything as do I there's.

13
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:07,940
Scott: no there's no two things that have the same unless they're really stupid.

14
00:01:08,062 --> 00:01:09,059
Scott: Right, like I don't give a shit.

15
00:01:09,143 --> 00:01:19,243
Rym: But yeah like I let's see I have I have two or three stupid throwaway passwords that I use for like literally Garbage account on a website because I have to log in to see you sound like a post and I'll never go to it Exactly.

16
00:01:19,706 --> 00:01:22,320
Rym: Yep, or like shitto forum or whatever.

17
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:29,688
Rym: But the one interesting thing is that whenever I do this and you're right as much as I talk about like me too Like change your passwords all the time and all that.

18
00:01:30,391 --> 00:01:32,080
Rym: I don't change my passwords that off.

19
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,667
Scott: I should go through and change them all though.

20
00:01:33,748 --> 00:01:36,500
Rym: It was about time because there's been like the longer you wait.

21
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,880
Rym: There's like this accretion of hashes.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,480
Scott: I want to switch to pass phrases because they're easier to remember and even more secure but some websites don't let you pass phrase.

23
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,463
Rym: So here's the problem.

24
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:47,106
Rym: I ran into.

25
00:01:47,206 --> 00:01:50,960
Rym: actually I wanted to do the thing that I used to do when I was young.

26
00:01:51,723 --> 00:01:55,460
Rym: I stopped doing because it was a pain and I wanted to do it again.

27
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:06,240
Rym: And what I stopped doing was my passwords were very very long But they were and they were pretty similar to each other But they had some differences that I could figure out that no one else obviously could.

28
00:02:06,662 --> 00:02:09,880
Rym: So it's like a really good password and every site has a unique password.

29
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:16,980
Rym: But the problem was everyone started adding password complexity rules and everyone had different bullshitty rules.

30
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,992
Rym: So like some sites are like it has to have a number in a letter.

31
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:24,462
Rym: some sites are like it has to have a number And the number can't be the first or the last Character.

32
00:02:24,864 --> 00:02:29,320
Rym: and some sites like gotta have a special character, but other sites won't let you put in special characters.

33
00:02:29,621 --> 00:02:34,900
Rym: So I literally could not make a password that would match all the sites that I use.

34
00:02:35,742 --> 00:02:49,067
Rym: so I have a bullshitty password for a few things mostly like health insurance and all those things because those are like my Government stuff like New York State tax stuff for the old GeekNights sales tax thing Because they literally like their password.

35
00:02:49,087 --> 00:02:53,967
Rym: rules are like it can't be less than six characters But it can't be more than eight characters.

36
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:54,610
Scott: Yeah, they're very.

37
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,514
Scott: the thing is nowadays.

38
00:02:55,554 --> 00:03:09,264
Scott: They're actually very few Sites that have this problem right like I think like certain credit card and banks still have the stupid Requirement and almost every government site right but most wet like Twitter and all modern websites Google Passphrase work.

39
00:03:09,284 --> 00:03:21,827
Scott: so my recommendation for passphrases is there's a thing called dice where and basically dice where is a bunch of tables In different languages and you roll dice and that picks words and you pick some number of words And that's your passphrase.

40
00:03:21,847 --> 00:03:22,571
Scott: so for example.

41
00:03:22,591 --> 00:03:23,638
Scott: I'm at rempeh us.

42
00:03:24,181 --> 00:03:26,720
Scott: Which is the basically the dice where website yeah?

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,531
Scott: And I'm push the button to generate a six word dice where a passphrase.

44
00:03:31,073 --> 00:03:41,026
Scott: so my passphrase is Mac Alpha RT as in the letter R the letter T earl as in the earl of something Basin fort.

45
00:03:41,046 --> 00:03:45,160
Scott: so Mac alpha RT earl basin for you could remember that because you're only remembering six things.

46
00:03:45,301 --> 00:03:59,351
Scott: Yeah, if you type that like maybe ten times It'll be quit pretty well stuck in your brain and according to the math here It will take four millennia for modern computers to figure that one out Even without any capitals and numbers or anything.

47
00:03:59,532 --> 00:04:08,269
Rym: so basically what I have is a passphrase But it's salted with a bunch of different things that I'll know What those things would be for any given website or account.

48
00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:11,340
Scott: it's not even necessary if you just use the past the dice where?

49
00:04:12,581 --> 00:04:15,353
Rym: But then it's the same password for everything or you have to memorize.

50
00:04:15,373 --> 00:04:18,866
Rym: you memorize a bunch of different passphrases But there if they're completely different.

51
00:04:19,067 --> 00:04:27,425
Rym: I would not bother because I have like I counted because I did this I have 34 unique accounts on shit online that I care about in some fashion I think.

52
00:04:27,688 --> 00:04:29,442
Scott: at least though for the Google I think the past.

53
00:04:29,482 --> 00:04:34,660
Rym: oh no Google my Google password changes monthly and holy shit is it like one crazy-ass password?

54
00:04:35,227 --> 00:04:37,222
Rym: And I have the two-factor Google's.

55
00:04:37,262 --> 00:04:39,774
Rym: more important than anything like that is literally someone gets your Gmail.

56
00:04:39,794 --> 00:04:40,960
Scott: they got your everything yep.

57
00:04:41,221 --> 00:04:44,834
Rym: So I actually I bought so part of this was cool.

58
00:04:44,854 --> 00:04:52,539
Rym: I checked all the websites I had accounts on to see if they've added support for two-factor since the last time I checked and a lot of people have.

59
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:57,240
Rym: so I have two-factor now on Amazon on patreon a bunch of other things.

60
00:04:58,062 --> 00:04:58,506
Rym: It's notable.

61
00:04:58,526 --> 00:05:01,045
Rym: There's a lot of site like Newegg doesn't have it But Amazon does.

62
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,500
Scott: the other problem is that a lot of the mobile devices?

63
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,973
Scott: It just sucks to type in a fucking long password.

64
00:05:06,134 --> 00:05:12,557
Rym: Yeah, yeah That is actually why I used a. my passphrase is a little more complex than what you.

65
00:05:12,637 --> 00:05:16,217
Rym: it's not all words It's more kind of gibberish II nonsense that I just know.

66
00:05:16,257 --> 00:05:16,660
Rym: it's also.

67
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:25,820
Scott: That's another reason though that the lowercase full passphrase is good because on mobile It's a lot easier to type that because you don't have to stop and like press shift and find some weird character or something.

68
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:32,840
Rym: yep, but I also bought a YubiKey because I was checking some stuff out and Mine's like the first or second it won't work with anything.

69
00:05:32,981 --> 00:05:36,840
Rym: It doesn't work, but the new one is great because there's a new standard you to you to F or Fido.

70
00:05:37,342 --> 00:05:38,566
Rym: So what that means is anything.

71
00:05:38,606 --> 00:05:42,860
Rym: that was anything that you would normally do Google off with like that to TP stuff.

72
00:05:43,527 --> 00:05:44,456
Rym: If they support it.

73
00:05:45,061 --> 00:05:54,027
Rym: Then if you have a Chrome browser at least or if you use the NFC want to use it with your phone It with your phone you can use it to where your Google off Just shows you the code.

74
00:05:54,388 --> 00:05:57,660
Rym: It can't calculate the code unless you put the key next to your phone.

75
00:05:58,641 --> 00:05:59,787
Rym: It's basically three.

76
00:05:59,867 --> 00:06:02,580
Scott: So Google all the Google off app knows about the YubiKey.

77
00:06:02,882 --> 00:06:05,820
Rym: Yes, the Google off app will use a YubiKey Neo.

78
00:06:06,382 --> 00:06:13,672
Rym: So the Google off Apple run on iPhone or Android only Android only because iPhones Fucking suck and don't let you'd write any software on them.

79
00:06:13,712 --> 00:06:14,214
Rym: Apparently.

80
00:06:14,455 --> 00:06:15,460
Scott: Yeah, you can't do the NFC.

81
00:06:15,681 --> 00:06:19,358
Rym: Yeah, so I saw like I checked it out because I found someone who had one.

82
00:06:19,398 --> 00:06:19,880
Rym: It's pretty cool.

83
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:29,300
Rym: but the problem is most sites won't support the YubiKey stuff even though they do support Google off, but Google now supports it natively.

84
00:06:29,421 --> 00:06:32,400
Rym: so if you don't want to do the phone thing You can buy a cheap YubiKey.

85
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:39,765
Rym: It's just a Fido only one and it'll work with any number of accounts and you can just use it as your second factor Instead of a phone.

86
00:06:40,207 --> 00:06:42,959
Rym: and if you set both up you can set it up to use either/or.

87
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:49,040
Rym: So the YubiKey could basically replace that sheet of paper with your 10 one-time codes that you encrypted and hid somewhere.

88
00:06:49,501 --> 00:06:50,766
Scott: Get to hide your YubiKey somewhere.

89
00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:52,934
Rym: My YubiKey is always on me.

90
00:06:53,015 --> 00:06:54,018
Rym: And so is my phone.

91
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:59,240
Rym: so And even if I lose them remember it's two factor they still got to know my password.

92
00:07:00,148 --> 00:07:05,960
Rym: so then Independently, I was like, you know what my work finance what our companies should use this everywhere.

93
00:07:06,061 --> 00:07:07,508
Rym: So I go to go to people like everyone.

94
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:09,900
Rym: you're fucking setting this up or I'm cutting off your access to shit.

95
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,381
Rym: Good.

96
00:07:11,402 --> 00:07:18,040
Rym: God did certain people like really resist doing this or refused to until I told him you won't get your email anymore.

97
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,419
Rym: Like really didn't want to do it.

98
00:07:21,721 --> 00:07:24,435
Rym: One of them had a blackberry and they were like, well the Google auth doesn't work.

99
00:07:24,455 --> 00:07:28,994
Rym: and I was like, I don't care There's an app on the blackberry and if there isn't buy a real phone.

100
00:07:29,597 --> 00:07:34,753
Rym: Oh But what was very interesting is that the old people were not resisting.

101
00:07:35,174 --> 00:07:38,743
Rym: it was the young people who were resisting younger than me.

102
00:07:38,944 --> 00:07:50,598
Rym: interesting then their passwords all appear to be garbage because I was paying attention when I was setting up lives forcing people to do it and I guess cuz I did IT like baby IT like long long ago like when I worked at RIT.

103
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:56,456
Rym: and You sort of get this instinct to not see passwords when people type them because people suck at typing.

104
00:07:56,476 --> 00:08:01,112
Rym: so bad that you will know Everyone's password unless you consciously avoid it.

105
00:08:01,474 --> 00:08:02,880
Rym: and I'd rather not even know the past.

106
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,916
Scott: Yeah, the IT guys in my work whenever you type a password they always turn around.

107
00:08:05,937 --> 00:08:07,751
Rym: Yep Like I got real good.

108
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:08,739
Scott: I would do the same thing, too.

109
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:14,438
Rym: Yeah the problem is if you were bad like you could you can know anyone's password just by watching them because people suck at this.

110
00:08:14,779 --> 00:08:22,019
Rym: but While I did not see what their passwords were I saw that their passwords were very short and did not involve the spacebar or the shift key.

111
00:08:22,987 --> 00:08:26,920
Rym: So Yeah, so that's what I've been doing.

112
00:08:27,261 --> 00:08:30,631
Rym: I highly recommend if you are out there listening to GeekNights do two-factor.

113
00:08:30,691 --> 00:08:38,100
Rym: if nothing else do two-factor on your gmail Because that is the thing that can fuck you more than any other account that could be compromised.

114
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,500
Scott: Do you want to have any like actual Wednesday shit?

115
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:46,760
Rym: Got any Wednesday news only I could only find because I think we are in fact the second longest running anime podcast in the world.

116
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:47,720
Rym: That's great.

117
00:08:47,982 --> 00:08:52,194
Rym: So the only anime world order started like a month before us But we have more anime episodes than they have episodes.

118
00:08:52,516 --> 00:09:02,046
Scott: the only The only Wednesday ish news that I could find is that one of our GeekNights' favorite comic creators.

119
00:09:02,066 --> 00:09:03,932
Scott: Jeff Lemire has a new comic coming.

120
00:09:04,113 --> 00:09:06,320
Rym: I didn't even finish the last several descender.

121
00:09:06,561 --> 00:09:07,885
Scott: No, I just enders still coming out.

122
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,631
Rym: I know I haven't even come up with them.

123
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,940
Scott: Anyway, um drill is a killer.

124
00:09:15,682 --> 00:09:17,370
Scott: So the new comment, I mean it's only the issue.

125
00:09:17,411 --> 00:09:19,280
Scott: I'm not buying it because I'm just waiting for the trade.

126
00:09:19,741 --> 00:09:20,844
Scott: It's coming from Dark Horse.

127
00:09:20,904 --> 00:09:22,047
Scott: It's black hammer.

128
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:24,072
Scott: So it's a superhero thing.

129
00:09:24,393 --> 00:09:25,797
Rym: I guess but black hammer.

130
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:30,740
Scott: All right, and it says Once they were heroes, but that age has long since passed.

131
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,176
Scott: So I guess they're washed up or heroes or something.

132
00:09:33,196 --> 00:09:40,747
Rym: It could be Watchmen It could be the Black Order or whatever that vanished from existence by a multiversal crisis Space bullshit.

133
00:09:40,807 --> 00:09:42,419
Scott: It sounds like some DC garbage.

134
00:09:43,442 --> 00:09:46,759
Rym: It's a Dark Horse comic, but it could also be some in call garbage.

135
00:09:47,582 --> 00:09:53,560
Scott: Right, so that's already that part that beginning part and the alternate art cover looks like old DC corny garbage.

136
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,504
Scott: I'm not interested in.

137
00:09:54,846 --> 00:09:56,996
Scott: but then the description goes on.

138
00:09:57,076 --> 00:10:02,673
Scott: it names all the heroes Whatever now lead simple lives in a timeless farming town.

139
00:10:03,075 --> 00:10:04,118
Rym: It's the town for the anime.

140
00:10:04,138 --> 00:10:04,800
Rym: We're reviewing today.

141
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:09,094
Scott: Yes, even as they try to find their way home trouble has a unique way whatever.

142
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:25,165
Scott: so it's like oh this is sort of like, you know old-school superheroes, but in a Modern and you know sort of a mystery anime type setting situation of like whoa What the fuck is going on.

143
00:10:25,226 --> 00:10:32,132
Scott: mystery, you know, so lost village plus You know washed up superheroes.

144
00:10:32,152 --> 00:10:35,899
Rym: yes Superman space nonsense all that biz Justice League.

145
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,327
Rym: I mean Lemire pretty much.

146
00:10:38,467 --> 00:10:39,210
Rym: I'll check out.

147
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:42,120
Scott: I don't think he's ever written a comic that I did not like reading.

148
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:45,319
Rym: I'll read the first trade if anything he does unless he starts out betraying me.

149
00:10:45,661 --> 00:10:48,171
Scott: Yeah, so well who knows there might be some betrayal.

150
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:50,400
Scott: I don't even know like what it's called Black Hammer.

151
00:10:50,501 --> 00:10:52,010
Scott: It's like dude the title alone.

152
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,559
Scott: I don't even need the description.

153
00:10:54,881 --> 00:10:55,163
Scott: Right.

154
00:10:55,485 --> 00:10:57,840
Scott: It's like mouse guard who's like home run with the black eggs.

155
00:10:58,027 --> 00:11:01,294
Scott: Yeah You can hit a lot farther home run with a black hammer than you can with the eggs.

156
00:11:01,334 --> 00:11:09,629
Rym: that black axe lived up to everything it should have lived up to - so in The today it looks like it was New York Comic Con.

157
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:10,432
Rym: get your badge day.

158
00:11:10,572 --> 00:11:12,460
Scott: and did everyone have a profile set up?

159
00:11:12,741 --> 00:11:13,787
Rym: Apparently everyone did like.

160
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:16,040
Rym: I trolled around a little bit on social media networks.

161
00:11:16,361 --> 00:11:18,771
Rym: There didn't seem to be that many people who were confused.

162
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:21,160
Scott: Well people who had social media accounts weren't confused.

163
00:11:21,343 --> 00:11:22,499
Scott: Yeah, what about the normies?

164
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,602
Rym: I care not.

165
00:11:23,723 --> 00:11:27,374
Rym: the basics do not care anymore because the reality is.

166
00:11:27,795 --> 00:11:33,240
Rym: there was a time when fan conventions And that's why my news is not the comic-con badge situation because everyone's flipping out.

167
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,698
Rym: I think they're already all sold out like no badges That many people made profiles to sell out.

168
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:48,220
Rym: Wow there is not that much overlap between the people who go to Paxes and the people who go to New York Comic Con because no one in my social media was really complaining about this.

169
00:11:48,663 --> 00:11:57,460
Rym: it's like this whole other set of people and They were all making like you think like the people who complain about packs at least have been to a lot of paxes and conventions.

170
00:11:57,881 --> 00:12:03,799
Rym: So when they complain like while they're wrong about their solutions, they're like several steps beyond babies.

171
00:12:03,859 --> 00:12:05,499
Rym: first Why can't I get a badge?

172
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:11,660
Rym: Like they at least are like what if they do a lottery like they've come up with all these crazy ideas like they know the basics of the situation.

173
00:12:12,286 --> 00:12:16,811
Rym: The comic-con people are like baby birds Like they're like it's the fucking scalpers.

174
00:12:16,932 --> 00:12:18,017
Rym: Oh my god the scouts.

175
00:12:18,057 --> 00:12:23,114
Scott: No, dude It's not as far as scalping for this than any convention ever with New York City.

176
00:12:23,495 --> 00:12:24,920
Rym: people go there for a day.

177
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:29,113
Rym: There are like 60 million people who can get there as a day trip if they want.

178
00:12:29,153 --> 00:12:31,200
Rym: there are not 60 million badges for sale.

179
00:12:32,141 --> 00:12:34,532
Rym: But so people have you know that that all happened?

180
00:12:34,572 --> 00:12:40,180
Rym: it was interesting to watch that go down But my news is actually from April because it's tangentially related.

181
00:12:40,882 --> 00:12:50,978
Rym: So basically New York Comic Con in the old days was a free-for-all and kind of a shit show Like we went every year either as guests.

182
00:12:51,099 --> 00:12:53,927
Scott: Well the Attempted to go the first year.

183
00:12:53,967 --> 00:12:55,934
Scott: I didn't go but I walked past it.

184
00:12:55,994 --> 00:12:57,580
Rym: That was the one the fire marshal shut down.

185
00:12:57,701 --> 00:13:00,100
Scott: I wanted to see what the deal was on the first year.

186
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,216
Scott: So I walked past it and saw crazy lines going out the building and no one getting in.

187
00:13:03,236 --> 00:13:07,000
Scott: and the second year I went for like a night after work on Friday.

188
00:13:07,221 --> 00:13:08,265
Scott: Yeah, just to see you and it was.

189
00:13:08,486 --> 00:13:10,355
Scott: that's all the time I needed but it's worth telling.

190
00:13:10,395 --> 00:13:14,132
Scott: and then like the third and fourth Years, I went went for a day each and that was it.

191
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:20,360
Rym: I went to every Yeah, and I went to a lot of the New York comic cons.

192
00:13:20,606 --> 00:13:27,300
Scott: Oh, yeah There was a New York comic-con slash anime festival where I went like only for like Sunday morning to see Makoto Shinkai.

193
00:13:28,006 --> 00:13:30,646
Rym: I think that was the year I did panels But you didn't like.

194
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:31,975
Rym: you just didn't care didn't even want to go.

195
00:13:31,996 --> 00:13:36,718
Scott: I got in Sunday I went in we saw a Makoto Shinkai's movie and then left and but he's got a new movie coming.

196
00:13:36,738 --> 00:13:37,823
Scott: by the way That's another news.

197
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:44,420
Scott: Makoto Shinkai has a new movie and when I saw the screen capture slash poster for it I thought it was just an old Makoto Shinkai.

198
00:13:45,403 --> 00:13:47,029
Rym: I saw it in the distance on Scott's tablet.

199
00:13:47,049 --> 00:13:49,677
Rym: I was like isn't that place promised in early days or whatever?

200
00:13:49,818 --> 00:13:51,605
Scott: Yeah It's like.

201
00:13:51,645 --> 00:13:53,259
Scott: did someone did someone ripping off Makoto Shinkai?

202
00:13:53,762 --> 00:13:59,188
Rym: Movie it's coming but in the old days like for many many years New York comic-con was not that well attended.

203
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:08,869
Rym: more importantly like if you went to the panels area No one went to panels at all and the panels were all like nothing But you could just get free badges like we.

204
00:14:08,989 --> 00:14:12,480
Rym: I've never in my life paid for a New York comic-con near to anime festival badge.

205
00:14:12,701 --> 00:14:16,739
Rym: Yet I went to a ton of them and we did not perform at all of them.

206
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,400
Rym: Basically, I would just go walk in not even pre-reg and look at every booth and leave now.

207
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:27,952
Rym: But without a badge I would go up I'd go to like the reg area and I'd be like, I'm a professional I'd like to get a professional badge

208
00:14:28,578 --> 00:14:28,699
Scott: and

209
00:14:29,282 --> 00:14:37,374
Rym: I would just talk to humans until eventually they handed me this golden badge that got me in Like even before the lot like they let me in early like people would do like.

210
00:14:37,394 --> 00:14:40,183
Rym: I basically do whatever I wanted and I did This every year.

211
00:14:40,203 --> 00:14:45,260
Rym: I always had either a professional badge or a press badge or a guest slash presenter badge.

212
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:46,895
Rym: The badges were different every year.

213
00:14:48,322 --> 00:14:53,140
Rym: So the news was for this year a lot of people on the internet and by people.

214
00:14:53,843 --> 00:14:57,740
Rym: These are people who have pretensions of being journalists or being in the entertainment industry.

215
00:14:58,262 --> 00:15:01,600
Rym: But the reality is a lot of them are smaller time than GeekNights.

216
00:15:02,121 --> 00:15:02,442
Scott: Okay,

217
00:15:02,924 --> 00:15:20,425
Rym: so they were all complaining that New York comic-con wouldn't let them get professional badges because New York comic-con over the last few years Finally tightened up that ship and doesn't give a professional badge to some guy who walks in and says yeah I do a podcast on anime And oh my god are people

218
00:15:20,445 --> 00:15:21,548
Scott: freaking out about

219
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:21,969
Rym: this?

220
00:15:22,751 --> 00:15:28,148
Scott: and What are the qualifications you need?

221
00:15:28,269 --> 00:15:29,393
Rym: so they don't tell you?

222
00:15:29,433 --> 00:15:30,980
Rym: as far as I can tell that's a problem.

223
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,398
Rym: They'd be that you submit your resume and they approve you.

224
00:15:35,478 --> 00:15:35,960
Scott: Oh, that's fine.

225
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:42,260
Rym: Yeah, so quote, please provide a detailed description of your current daily duties as it relates to the pop culture industry.

226
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:45,111
Scott: So did these people submit their applications?

227
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:47,560
Rym: that appears they all did and of course they were rejected.

228
00:15:47,841 --> 00:15:51,540
Rym: Okay, what do you have to accomplish by attending New York comic-con as a professional?

229
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,011
Rym: Please explain how you will integrate what you experience into your profession.

230
00:15:55,372 --> 00:16:02,033
Rym: Please provide and this is the one that no one can answer Please provide the names titles and email addresses of three professional contacts.

231
00:16:02,093 --> 00:16:04,560
Rym: We can contact for a professional reference.

232
00:16:06,161 --> 00:16:09,150
Rym: So and also even professional badges, they're not free anymore.

233
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:19,580
Rym: you got to pay pay less and you get in even though it's full Mmm, so I was sort of watching everyone just freaking out about this and then in my social media.

234
00:16:19,701 --> 00:16:23,000
Scott: But if you're actually a professional you should be able to do that really easily.

235
00:16:23,101 --> 00:16:25,836
Scott: So there's only reason to freak out is if you're not a professional now.

236
00:16:25,876 --> 00:16:33,220
Rym: in the old days They had some rules that they published about like how many hits your site had to get or whatever to get those badges.

237
00:16:34,122 --> 00:16:34,804
Rym: But I'll tell you what.

238
00:16:34,904 --> 00:16:37,613
Rym: even back then GeekNights qualified like one year.

239
00:16:37,714 --> 00:16:47,585
Rym: I literally took our Libsyn stats Printed them brought them with me because the thing said like bring three business cards bring like evidence of your websites traffic and all this stuff.

240
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:53,951
Rym: and I brought it all with me and I handed to the lady and she looked at it and she Was like good because we were way above the standard.

241
00:16:54,212 --> 00:17:00,579
Rym: and I read this was I don't remember what year this was But it was the year I went on Emily's birthday in the morning and then I just left because there's nothing to do.

242
00:17:01,382 --> 00:17:06,540
Rym: And then yeah, but is that someone's birthday soon, uh, yeah, okay October.

243
00:17:07,621 --> 00:17:16,846
Rym: But I remember while I was handing my paperwork over at the stall next to me was this dude And he claimed to work for some anime journalism outfit.

244
00:17:17,126 --> 00:17:26,640
Rym: I didn't recognize him obviously and He was basically trying to explain to the lady why he didn't have business cards and it was just make them dude.

245
00:17:26,861 --> 00:17:32,289
Rym: It was obvious that he had never had a business card In his entire life.

246
00:17:32,309 --> 00:17:33,436
Scott: not like you have to do something.

247
00:17:33,456 --> 00:17:34,200
Scott: they make business cards.

248
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,720
Scott: You can print them at moo.com or even vista print for your money.

249
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:38,504
Scott: Oh, it's so cheap.

250
00:17:38,906 --> 00:17:40,192
Rym: the lady was given.

251
00:17:40,212 --> 00:17:41,920
Rym: the look on her face was like kid.

252
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,739
Rym: You couldn't even just like fake it and get a free one from staples.

253
00:17:44,841 --> 00:17:45,982
Scott: Yeah You could go to.

254
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:51,888
Scott: you can go to stables and print like 10 business cards on one sheet and cut him with a scissor Like you couldn't even fake it kid.

255
00:17:52,249 --> 00:17:55,020
Rym: So and but he's not even saying like oh, I don't have business cards.

256
00:17:55,221 --> 00:18:00,760
Rym: He was literally like telling the sob story about how like his business cards didn't arrive because of something happened.

257
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,660
Rym: But he's got to cover the event for your website your professional.

258
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,568
Scott: Why were you ordering business cards at the last second?

259
00:18:05,588 --> 00:18:07,254
Scott: Shouldn't you've had them because you've been in the business.

260
00:18:07,535 --> 00:18:17,920
Rym: Yeah, so I don't have a lot of sympathy for the people who are cut out because one if You were cut out and you can't get a professional badge You probably had no business being a professional in New York Comic Con.

261
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:24,231
Rym: But more importantly you probably don't even need to go to New York Comic Con Because what are you going to do there except be a fan like the new?

262
00:18:24,272 --> 00:18:35,092
Rym: the journalists cover the shit out of this car but anyway things of the day.

263
00:18:35,112 --> 00:18:39,999
Rym: so This is something, you know black right like the color black.

264
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,908
Rym: Yes, well, this is darker than black.

265
00:18:44,069 --> 00:18:45,874
Scott: Oh that that new material.

266
00:18:45,914 --> 00:18:46,756
Rym: That's a black.

267
00:18:46,857 --> 00:18:47,398
Scott: I saw that.

268
00:18:47,699 --> 00:18:50,046
Rym: so That's the only 10.

269
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:52,840
Scott: you can't even tell what shape it is because the light all absorbs into it.

270
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,933
Scott: So yeah, you had to feel it to see what shape it is.

271
00:18:55,074 --> 00:18:56,060
Rym: So it's kind of cool.

272
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:03,680
Rym: So this is a really good video one size show You should watch in general because if you even if you're like a short attention fish baby fish kid loud on the internet.

273
00:19:04,161 --> 00:19:11,420
Rym: Their videos are like a couple minutes long and they tell you they give you a lot of real science information in a hurry.

274
00:19:11,862 --> 00:19:15,375
Rym: But basically in this video they talk about what vantablack is.

275
00:19:15,756 --> 00:19:16,720
Rym: it's darker than black.

276
00:19:17,221 --> 00:19:20,551
Rym: It's way darker than that and not darker than black.

277
00:19:20,631 --> 00:19:24,043
Scott: It's it's just the most light absorbing material We've made.

278
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:26,353
Scott: it absorbs like it only reflects like point.

279
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,080
Scott: Oh something percent of light.

280
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:32,165
Scott: So it's not completely black like black of space But it's it's so.

281
00:19:32,225 --> 00:19:35,180
Scott: it's so black that effectively a human can't see it.

282
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:39,200
Scott: You just look at it and it looks like there's just like a hole in space and you can't.

283
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,511
Scott: Cameras can't see you can't tell what shape it is.

284
00:19:41,531 --> 00:19:43,280
Scott: I mean people can see better than cameras.

285
00:19:43,601 --> 00:19:47,960
Rym: Yeah, well in some ways but not unless you have an ultra ultra ultra HDR camera.

286
00:19:48,301 --> 00:19:51,859
Rym: But this might you might seem like okay, whatever they can coat the insides of telescopes.

287
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:57,400
Rym: You need to see this shit because when you see it It kind of breaks your brain a little bit.

288
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:03,660
Scott: Because you can't because the light doesn't reflect it doesn't have a shape or three-dimensional shape.

289
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,240
Scott: It looks like there's just a hole in space from all sides.

290
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:13,960
Rym: It's a two-dimensional shape as far as your brain is concerned and human brains really have never experienced that before.

291
00:20:14,502 --> 00:20:18,700
Rym: Mm-hmm, like it's not something we've ever experienced ever until recently.

292
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,260
Scott: It's like if you had a hole in it and your arm was coming out through the hole.

293
00:20:21,642 --> 00:20:32,950
Scott: It would look like this arm was just like dissing behind like whoa Oh Yep, some sort of trippy stoner LSD animation shit yep, but it real it's not fake it real.

294
00:20:33,091 --> 00:20:42,210
Rym: this video is really cool and talks about it and I only brought it up because I always make fun of that anime darker than black And I had to reference it at some point.

295
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:44,080
Scott: how many episode how much darker than black have you seen?

296
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,197
Rym: One episode.

297
00:20:46,237 --> 00:20:48,499
Scott: Yeah What happened in that episode?

298
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:58,507
Rym: there was a wall on the outside of the fucking city or something and There's a bunch of proper nouns of people talking about like wow the walls there But there's all right.

299
00:20:58,668 --> 00:21:02,711
Scott: anyone who's actually seen darker than black Tell me how Rym is doesn't remember anything about the show.

300
00:21:02,731 --> 00:21:07,029
Rym: and then aren't there the demon guys Who their power like they could.

301
00:21:07,049 --> 00:21:14,200
Rym: you can get a power like a thing will happen with a contract But then the contract makes you do something weird like all I remember is supernatural dudes fighting on a roof.

302
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:22,100
Rym: Yeah, they like like you'll get the demon power, but then you have to break your finger or you get the demon power But then you have to like dump out a bunch of sand and count all the grains.

303
00:21:22,821 --> 00:21:23,144
Scott: Anyway,

304
00:21:23,771 --> 00:21:39,159
Rym: anyway that show I'm gonna continue to make fun of it because that one girl in the back and anime Boston when I referenced it a lot of People didn't even get the reference, but that one girl started laughing So hard, I feel like I feel like I hit her with the arrow of comedy if no one else.

305
00:21:40,661 --> 00:21:42,449
Rym: Anyway in the Madam Argus you got a thing today.

306
00:21:43,313 --> 00:21:44,860
Scott: Oh, that wasn't the black thing wasn't your news.

307
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:45,403
Scott: It was thing a day.

308
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:46,167
Rym: We're in things of the day.

309
00:21:46,228 --> 00:21:52,596
Scott: I said, okay anyway things Of the day I wasn't paying attention things No one gives a shit.

310
00:21:52,657 --> 00:21:59,137
Scott: so Last year the Mets were very good much better than the Mets usually are.

311
00:21:59,478 --> 00:22:00,547
Scott: this baseball We're talking about.

312
00:22:00,587 --> 00:22:01,700
Rym: you went to a World Series.

313
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,265
Scott: There was a World Series in New York And it wasn't in the Bronx.

314
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:07,713
Rym: like you were there and the Mets were there.

315
00:22:07,733 --> 00:22:13,020
Scott: that hasn't happened since the year 2000 when the entire World Series is played.

316
00:22:15,642 --> 00:22:16,846
Scott: Anyway and the met you know.

317
00:22:16,866 --> 00:22:20,300
Scott: so you know we didn't win, but hey we can't complain about that.

318
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,568
Scott: That doesn't come very often.

319
00:22:21,608 --> 00:22:24,101
Rym: Yeah like one of my favorite things to say about the Red Wings They have.

320
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:29,077
Rym: they've lost more Stanley Cup championships like final rounds than any team in the NHL.

321
00:22:29,218 --> 00:22:29,418
Scott: right.

322
00:22:29,438 --> 00:22:32,935
Scott: so anyway This year the Mets ain't bad.

323
00:22:33,116 --> 00:22:39,020
Scott: like usual They're not the worst, but they're like in second place, and they're you know they're losing to the first-place team.

324
00:22:39,081 --> 00:22:41,119
Scott: They lost like 11 to 4 the other day.

325
00:22:44,047 --> 00:22:45,100
Scott: Right this is expected.

326
00:22:45,241 --> 00:22:48,335
Scott: You're not gonna lose by a little and you know plenty of people.

327
00:22:48,676 --> 00:23:00,569
Scott: you know who are Mets fans Mostly talk about how bad the Mets are but for some reason this video despite being pretty old yet Also despite how old it is still has Citi Field and not Shea Stadium in it Which makes me feel even older.

328
00:23:00,569 --> 00:23:02,077
Rym: 2010 was a long time ago.

329
00:23:02,358 --> 00:23:12,619
Scott: Yeah Someone made this really funny video about how bad the Mets are And I for some reason I didn't discover this video until like a week or two ago.

330
00:23:12,921 --> 00:23:19,926
Rym: It captures all the beauty of like a public access commercial right down to the production and like yeah It's it's pretty good.

331
00:23:20,046 --> 00:23:26,536
Scott: You could just apply the same formula to many other bad things And it would be equally funny, but we got it first so deal with it.

332
00:23:26,737 --> 00:23:32,320
Rym: Yeah In the moment the book club books gonna be Oryx and Craig by Margaret Atwood, but there's a problem.

333
00:23:33,128 --> 00:23:34,300
Rym: So I just finished.

334
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,291
Rym: Basically the entire Wheel of Time went around.

335
00:23:37,311 --> 00:23:39,119
Scott: the whole wheel went around the whole wheel.

336
00:23:39,901 --> 00:23:43,703
Rym: Actually I went outside the wheel whoa And you know what.

337
00:23:44,305 --> 00:23:48,140
Rym: it would be plausible to say that the prince of nothing happens in the same world.

338
00:23:48,361 --> 00:23:51,659
Scott: I mean look isn't it one of those ones you could say anything happens in the same world uh?

339
00:23:52,861 --> 00:23:59,379
Scott: It's pretty specific though like there's korai And such was there a spaceship that crashed that bad guys come out of it.

340
00:23:59,801 --> 00:24:07,460
Rym: Uh so it is implied that some people may have fled that planet to avoid the dark one and just went to another.

341
00:24:07,782 --> 00:24:10,238
Scott: And so the plants and nothing is the planet they went to.

342
00:24:10,338 --> 00:24:11,922
Scott: yeah Evil demons.

343
00:24:11,943 --> 00:24:13,025
Scott: because remember the prince of nothing.

344
00:24:13,046 --> 00:24:15,352
Scott: is there a sarcophagus in a tornado.

345
00:24:15,372 --> 00:24:20,245
Rym: Ah there is in the outside Outside of the Wheel of Time.

346
00:24:20,305 --> 00:24:29,254
Rym: that's where the dark one is and it's real similar to the outside of the Prince of Nothing And the outside fucking sucks, and you don't want it to get in.

347
00:24:29,294 --> 00:24:31,300
Scott: but is the dark one a sarcophagus of the tornado?

348
00:24:31,981 --> 00:24:39,940
Rym: yeah, but I don't think he made it into the world or maybe the sarcophagus tornado might have been in the third age anyway.

349
00:24:41,381 --> 00:24:51,454
Rym: The one thing you would appreciate about the end of this book is that your complaint about every fantasy book even the prince of nothing Is that the whole time there's all these references to like the old king?

350
00:24:51,755 --> 00:24:53,159
Rym: yeah like the crazy bad?

351
00:24:53,941 --> 00:24:55,246
Scott: Therian the crazy badass.

352
00:24:55,447 --> 00:25:08,193
Rym: if you skip all the other books the Wheel of Time and just read the last one Every single character who is still alive is now a crazy bad leveled up to be like Arthur Hawkwing is like goddamn guys like holy shit, so Arthur Hawkwing is like a chump.

353
00:25:08,213 --> 00:25:09,919
Rym: compare their Hawkwing is there?

354
00:25:09,939 --> 00:25:11,738
Scott: well They blow the horn and he shows up right.

355
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:12,766
Rym: yeah And he look he walks on me.

356
00:25:12,786 --> 00:25:14,074
Rym: a little spoiler are they blowing the horn?

357
00:25:14,115 --> 00:25:14,920
Scott: like every five minutes?

358
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,251
Rym: He basically walks over to Matt Cawthon, and he's like son Good job.

359
00:25:19,675 --> 00:25:20,199
Rym: Holy shit.

360
00:25:22,101 --> 00:25:27,576
Rym: But it is literally everyone casting hundredth level spells going crazy bail fire.

361
00:25:27,596 --> 00:25:29,100
Rym: we got anti bail fire.

362
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:30,083
Scott: Shit son.

363
00:25:30,203 --> 00:25:36,060
Rym: like everything you think every crazy bullshit ancient king thing that you think could happen it happens at one point.

364
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,209
Rym: You're like why don't they just make gateways to lava.

365
00:25:38,249 --> 00:25:40,860
Rym: Yeah fucking gateways to lava all over the place.

366
00:25:42,982 --> 00:25:44,126
Rym: It's it's worth the payoff.

367
00:25:44,467 --> 00:25:44,668
Rym: Well.

368
00:25:44,708 --> 00:25:45,450
Rym: I don't know if anyone else.

369
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,734
Rym: you necessarily read all these books.

370
00:25:47,035 --> 00:25:48,540
Rym: the payoff of the last book?

371
00:25:49,602 --> 00:25:55,916
Rym: No, just tell me uh There's a lot going on every level of every crazy level that only care about certain parts.

372
00:25:55,997 --> 00:26:02,925
Rym: all right The second most powerful wizard in the world, maybe the third most powerful on the girls side Picks up.

373
00:26:02,965 --> 00:26:04,692
Rym: she basically when chaos strikes.

374
00:26:04,873 --> 00:26:06,620
Rym: you know that storeroom where there's all the like angry.

375
00:26:06,681 --> 00:26:08,013
Rym: Oh that no one will touch in the basement.

376
00:26:08,154 --> 00:26:10,789
Rym: She just goes down there And she's like what's the fucking strongest one we've got?

377
00:26:11,271 --> 00:26:13,160
Rym: and she pulls out Vora's rod.

378
00:26:13,602 --> 00:26:18,022
Rym: Yeah, or his rod is like almost as powerful as Kalindor, and she's like fuck I don't know.

379
00:26:18,042 --> 00:26:19,187
Scott: two statues with the balls.

380
00:26:19,247 --> 00:26:22,660
Rym: no Kalindor is the sword that's not a sword all right that showed in Chi.

381
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:23,770
Rym: I think that's what it is.

382
00:26:24,133 --> 00:26:27,550
Rym: is the two statues It's not that powerful ran destroyed those.

383
00:26:27,591 --> 00:26:27,832
Rym: he was like.

384
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:29,900
Rym: you know what those things we and play God.

385
00:26:29,961 --> 00:26:30,690
Rym: Let's just not use those.

386
00:26:30,771 --> 00:26:31,074
Rym: good job.

387
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:34,571
Rym: I feel like there's a better way to handle that but I digress.

388
00:26:34,591 --> 00:26:34,732
Scott: I would.

389
00:26:34,812 --> 00:26:36,519
Scott: I mean I'm sad that he didn't play God though.

390
00:26:37,102 --> 00:26:39,972
Rym: Uh actually you get a flashback and find out what happens if you play God.

391
00:26:40,112 --> 00:26:40,513
Rym: Oh, that's good.

392
00:26:40,533 --> 00:26:41,657
Rym: That's why the taint is there.

393
00:26:41,677 --> 00:26:45,728
Rym: all right But that's not the problem.

394
00:26:46,311 --> 00:26:56,520
Rym: the problem is that Just as I finish that and I'm about to start reading Oryx and Crake The new our Scott backer books like about gonna come out in like the next week or two it's that soon.

395
00:26:56,761 --> 00:26:58,128
Rym: It's like it's actually happening.

396
00:26:58,148 --> 00:26:59,474
Scott: It's not a joke it appears to be.

397
00:26:59,574 --> 00:27:00,680
Scott: actually have not a tease.

398
00:27:01,102 --> 00:27:08,920
Rym: So we might delay Oryx and Crake and have to do a show on the new Prince of Nothing book It's got are gonna read it pretty much like I gotta reread some old friends of nothing verse.

399
00:27:09,101 --> 00:27:12,694
Rym: I gotta reread at least parts of the white luck warrior because not a hundred.

400
00:27:12,834 --> 00:27:19,019
Scott: I forgot how to take the shortest path I'm taking like a slightly less suboptimal path here like how am I gonna get across the step?

401
00:27:19,423 --> 00:27:20,679
Rym: I'm not a hundred percent sure.

402
00:27:21,141 --> 00:27:24,395
Rym: Regarding the fetus that was the key to that door.

403
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:25,660
Rym: and what's behind that door?

404
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:30,439
Scott: I don't remember a single word that is written on the tusk other than the fact that it's written on the time.

405
00:27:33,081 --> 00:27:38,679
Rym: Also something weird happened in the other book with the korai where memora like looked at it And then she like went through it in her brain.

406
00:27:38,944 --> 00:27:42,328
Scott: I do remember This fucking dragon and that's always.

407
00:27:42,368 --> 00:27:44,916
Scott: the good part of any fantasy novel is when the dragon shows up.

408
00:27:44,956 --> 00:27:55,935
Rym: that dragon is Actually one of my favorite characters in the entire story because the conversation that dragon has where they came in is like son Welcome to earth.

409
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:00,618
Scott: So I am the last one.

410
00:28:03,842 --> 00:28:04,787
Rym: So anyway, we did watch some.

411
00:28:04,827 --> 00:28:06,013
Rym: oh, yeah, we're gonna be a ConnectiCon.

412
00:28:06,034 --> 00:28:13,314
Rym: uh fucking next weekend Here, I'm gonna pull up our panel schedule because I made the entire panel schedule.

413
00:28:13,555 --> 00:28:14,960
Rym: I'm gonna log into the group take system.

414
00:28:15,661 --> 00:28:17,086
Scott: I still gotta make the staff schedule.

415
00:28:17,187 --> 00:28:20,760
Scott: Yeah, you do and no one sent me their whatever their schedule they want.

416
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,120
Scott: So I'm just putting I guess they don't care.

417
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,780
Rym: I mean all you have to do because I did all the other work in the department.

418
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:31,792
Rym: All you have to do is make sure everyone in our department who deserves a hotel room has one Has a schedule someone else taking care of the hotel stone.

419
00:28:32,254 --> 00:28:33,460
Rym: Yeah, but you're responsible for it.

420
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,089
Rym: You think you're some emails about that?

421
00:28:35,169 --> 00:28:37,200
Scott: I'll just ask them and be like, hey what happened with the hotel?

422
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:44,508
Rym: Just make sure that happens because I ain't if if some bullshit goes down people even with you if a guest just like where's My panel room they come to me.

423
00:28:45,071 --> 00:28:46,460
Rym: if a guest is like, where's my hotel?

424
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,644
Rym: I guess they're gonna come to me too.

425
00:28:48,025 --> 00:28:52,599
Rym: So we have split the duties of who goes who goes on to over this shit.

426
00:28:53,342 --> 00:28:56,232
Rym: But I'm gonna link to the actual panel schedule.

427
00:28:56,272 --> 00:28:56,794
Rym: It's live.

428
00:28:57,015 --> 00:28:58,520
Rym: It's not on the real ConnectiCon site.

429
00:28:58,963 --> 00:29:00,637
Rym: I'm not gonna even get into why that is.

430
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,939
Rym: It's on a different side.

431
00:29:02,542 --> 00:29:06,312
Rym: And also if you dislike the fonts on the thing, I'm linking to.

432
00:29:06,793 --> 00:29:09,340
Rym: by all means complain to ConnectiCon about it.

433
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:13,050
Rym: We didn't do it, please complain to ConnectiCon about that font.

434
00:29:13,111 --> 00:29:14,495
Rym: it is it's a font.

435
00:29:15,016 --> 00:29:15,136
Rym: it's.

436
00:29:15,297 --> 00:29:16,360
Rym: I've been looking at fonts a lot.

437
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,327
Rym: It's not Helvetica.

438
00:29:17,972 --> 00:29:19,638
Rym: It's a font.

439
00:29:20,961 --> 00:29:23,860
Rym: Meanwhile, I did find a really good font to use for printing.

440
00:29:24,161 --> 00:29:27,195
Rym: You know like packs is the banner that has like the panel schedule on each room.

441
00:29:27,215 --> 00:29:31,560
Rym: I Was trying to figure out what fonts to use for that because it's actually kind of a complex problem.

442
00:29:31,781 --> 00:29:34,348
Scott: There's a new feature in the newest Photoshop typekit.

443
00:29:34,909 --> 00:29:38,580
Scott: No, cuz if you use typekit, yeah, but typekit isn't isn't a new feature?

444
00:29:38,721 --> 00:29:41,860
Scott: No, but like using type you search for a font and you get it, whatever.

445
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:46,319
Scott: So the new feature is that you'll see you have a photo and in the photo, there's some letters.

446
00:29:46,721 --> 00:29:48,567
Scott: Yeah, you can select the letters.

447
00:29:48,588 --> 00:29:51,638
Scott: Oh shit Photoshop will tell you what the fuck fun it is.

448
00:29:51,658 --> 00:29:53,472
Rym: Oh shit I'm gonna find for everything.

449
00:29:53,512 --> 00:29:57,726
Scott: It'll also search Typekit and find a similar fun.

450
00:29:58,329 --> 00:29:59,775
Rym: Oh, I did not know about that feature.

451
00:29:59,956 --> 00:30:00,780
Scott: That's a brand new feature.

452
00:30:01,021 --> 00:30:04,100
Scott: Yes, this is why you pay for Photoshop you anti subscription morons.

453
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,140
Rym: Yeah, even without that you pay for Adobe, right?

454
00:30:07,102 --> 00:30:09,088
Rym: So I needed a font.

455
00:30:09,851 --> 00:30:11,757
Rym: I did cuz monospace fonts are just garbage.

456
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:14,871
Rym: I need it But I did I wanted except the ones for program.

457
00:30:15,072 --> 00:30:16,559
Rym: Well, yeah, but there's on a poster.

458
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:19,060
Scott: You know, why the fuck would you use a monospace on a poster?

459
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:31,720
Rym: however for a schedule poster what you want is a font that has a narrow width and a thick width and You want the numbers to not be monospace or the letters do not be monospace to a real kerning.

460
00:30:32,202 --> 00:30:37,540
Rym: But you want the numbers to be monospace so you can use them to have a nice lined up schedule.

461
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,472
Scott: You know just use a monospace font for the numbers.

462
00:30:39,513 --> 00:30:40,680
Scott: You don't use the same font for both.

463
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,607
Rym: Yeah, so I tried that.

464
00:30:41,628 --> 00:30:42,333
Rym: but I was looking around.

465
00:30:42,353 --> 00:30:47,139
Rym: monospace fonts All kind of look like shit and most of them have really bad zeros.

466
00:30:47,785 --> 00:30:48,959
Scott: Well, cuz the zeros usually have it.

467
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:53,320
Scott: That's why a lot of them have a lot of variations like, you know dot no dot slash no slash.

468
00:30:53,481 --> 00:30:58,782
Scott: Yep, because they know you might be programming and you need to see the zeros are different from the O's but you might not be Programming.

469
00:30:58,802 --> 00:31:01,371
Rym: Yeah, but I digress the schedule is pretty good.

470
00:31:01,431 --> 00:31:04,020
Rym: There are a lot of pretty good-looking panels.

471
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,875
Scott: Well, cuz the con ends at 9 so you're able to cut out all the shitty panels.

472
00:31:06,916 --> 00:31:07,720
Scott: Sorry shitty panels.

473
00:31:07,848 --> 00:31:16,059
Rym: Yep I also had to cut out a lot of good panels because we probably had double the submissions we've ever had Despite the fact that we have like 30% fewer spaces to put them.

474
00:31:16,581 --> 00:31:22,140
Rym: So I rejected like a lot of good stuff alongside the really bad good put on the waitlist.

475
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:23,246
Scott: Okay, someone bails.

476
00:31:23,487 --> 00:31:24,835
Rym: we're doing like four or five panels.

477
00:31:24,875 --> 00:31:33,170
Rym: We can't do a lot because Well, two of them are anime openers from around the world good and more Anime openers from around the world.

478
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,959
Scott: and you said you rejected a good panel for that.

479
00:31:35,941 --> 00:31:37,309
Rym: That's actually really popular.

480
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:39,420
Rym: Whatever people like really like that stuff.

481
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:45,808
Rym: Also the panel I would have put in instead would be like Charles Dunbar's anime opener panels but he is not attending this year because I was.

482
00:31:45,889 --> 00:31:50,969
Rym: I unfortunately cannot give hotel rooms or Real accommodation to professionals like.

483
00:31:51,069 --> 00:31:52,073
Rym: I can't get people shit.

484
00:31:52,394 --> 00:31:53,940
Rym: the most I can get you is a badge.

485
00:31:54,381 --> 00:32:00,480
Rym: So anyone that the other guest departments won't bring I can't bring them because I can't give them money or anything.

486
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,089
Rym: That's a shame, but that's not my mandate.

487
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,293
Rym: I don't want a bigger mandate.

488
00:32:04,534 --> 00:32:05,256
Rym: kinetic guns coming.

489
00:32:05,537 --> 00:32:06,240
Rym: We're doing those.

490
00:32:06,581 --> 00:32:10,675
Rym: We're doing writing game rules, which is a variant on a panel that we did before that.

491
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:11,900
Rym: We're probably gonna do at PAX Prime.

492
00:32:13,382 --> 00:32:16,097
Rym: I think I'm putting in an overwatch panel that if Scott doesn't want to do it.

493
00:32:16,137 --> 00:32:16,619
Rym: I'll just do it.

494
00:32:17,002 --> 00:32:19,360
Scott: I don't know anything about other than oh, it's an FPS Blizzard made.

495
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,000
Scott: It's like Team Fortress, but more skills want to be on the panel anyway.

496
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,529
Scott: Everyone I know plays it constantly and I don't.

497
00:32:24,669 --> 00:32:27,338
Rym: so you'll be on the panel you be the hater or at least the.

498
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:28,382
Scott: I've already Said everything.

499
00:32:28,402 --> 00:32:30,952
Rym: I have to say you should be playing this game Scott.

500
00:32:30,972 --> 00:32:32,357
Scott: Yeah, I can't play netrunner.

501
00:32:32,939 --> 00:32:34,705
Rym: Uh This is way better than netrunner.

502
00:32:35,227 --> 00:32:40,426
Rym: I doubt that Scott remember how we felt when we played tribes like remember that era That's somehow.

503
00:32:40,466 --> 00:32:41,070
Scott: why do I know?

504
00:32:41,131 --> 00:32:41,755
Scott: it's not tribes.

505
00:32:41,775 --> 00:32:42,238
Scott: There's no way.

506
00:32:42,379 --> 00:32:42,904
Rym: no It's not.

507
00:32:42,945 --> 00:32:44,220
Scott: tribes doesn't even have vehicles.

508
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:50,869
Rym: But remember the feel of like you come home and you just log into tribes and all your friends are already playing tribes and you Join a gameplay tribes.

509
00:32:51,372 --> 00:32:52,179
Rym: I get that every night.

510
00:32:53,784 --> 00:32:55,568
Rym: Right now half our friends.

511
00:32:55,768 --> 00:32:58,515
Rym: Lisa just messaged me like are you playing like?

512
00:32:58,736 --> 00:33:00,240
Rym: she wants me to play right now?

513
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:05,265
Scott: good So I could actually have a life because all you people who you play in this game and I'll be doing stuff Everyone's playing.

514
00:33:05,285 --> 00:33:08,298
Rym: Oh good 13 messages of people who want to play right now.

515
00:33:08,318 --> 00:33:12,547
Scott: I'm good Tells me it's a good idea not to do that.

516
00:33:12,768 --> 00:33:14,053
Rym: But yeah, Connecticut will be there.

517
00:33:14,234 --> 00:33:15,720
Rym: pecs prime will be there.

518
00:33:16,344 --> 00:33:19,789
Rym: I hope we'll have panels, but I can't say yes We will until we get the confirmation.

519
00:33:19,809 --> 00:33:26,339
Rym: I would never assume PAX dev I'll be there if nothing else because I'm just going as an attendee if I even if I don't have panel.

520
00:33:30,663 --> 00:33:31,438
Rym: That's all the better.

521
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,464
Rym: Patreon t-shirts.

522
00:33:34,187 --> 00:33:35,190
Rym: a bunch of you bought t-shirts.

523
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:36,916
Rym: suddenly like a whole bunch you just bought t-shirts.

524
00:33:36,997 --> 00:33:39,066
Rym: So cool I guess what the fuck.

525
00:33:39,429 --> 00:33:41,380
Rym: I got some designs for new t-shirts.

526
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:45,055
Rym: So the new t-shirts that might be coming our chicken surprise.

527
00:33:45,538 --> 00:33:50,379
Rym: Oh, okay I got a really good Concept that I'm gonna work with Emily to kind of flesh out.

528
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:57,720
Rym: There's a picture of a really excited dog and a really not excited dog That's been making the rounds because everyone's kind of like, oh, it's from and Scott.

529
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,689
Scott: So you're the only one who make in the round.

530
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:02,820
Rym: No, it gets tweeted at me kind of regularly.

531
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:04,525
Rym: You've seen those dogs, right?

532
00:34:04,806 --> 00:34:05,047
Rym: Mm-hmm.

533
00:34:05,108 --> 00:34:07,016
Rym: Yeah, so I kind of want to make a t-shirt.

534
00:34:07,036 --> 00:34:08,080
Scott: doesn't someone own that photo?

535
00:34:08,601 --> 00:34:12,498
Rym: No, I want to make a t-shirt that is inspired by that those dogs and us in some fashion.

536
00:34:13,303 --> 00:34:15,755
Rym: A stylized photo stylized design, I don't know.

537
00:34:15,775 --> 00:34:16,399
Rym: I'm coming up with it.

538
00:34:16,801 --> 00:34:20,059
Rym: But I'm doing chicken surprise first because goddamn do I want that chicken surprise shirt?

539
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:33,400
Rym: So when we did our panel at anime Boston our annual panel judge anime by its cover one of the anime we judged By its cover was the lost village and we said, oh this looks like it has an interesting concept.

540
00:34:33,581 --> 00:34:38,856
Scott: It looks like it's sort of got one of those like scenario situations like nine doors nine.

541
00:34:38,897 --> 00:34:40,020
Rym: Whatever is nine something?

542
00:34:40,281 --> 00:34:41,446
Scott: You know the things that they saw

543
00:34:41,487 --> 00:34:42,310
Rym: doors nine dogs

544
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:59,345
Scott: a lot of Japanese and Asian You know in all mediums books movies, you know, especially, you know I think the oldest one I remember is like battle royale where you get a bunch of varied characters and they get somehow get stuck Separated from society in an

545
00:34:59,545 --> 00:35:01,250
Rym: oddly specific predicament

546
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:09,739
Scott: right in a in a scenario with a bunch of rules and Or mysteries and is something supernatural or something sinister.

547
00:35:09,759 --> 00:35:12,746
Rym: now This is a common trope outside of anime Like there's a bunch of like.

548
00:35:12,766 --> 00:35:14,660
Rym: if you go to Netflix just go through random movies.

549
00:35:15,102 --> 00:35:19,740
Rym: There's a lot of like American movies that you don't even remember that are this exact same thing.

550
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,848
Rym: Yeah, it's just in anime.

551
00:35:21,868 --> 00:35:25,120
Rym: There seems to be an acceleration of these over the last five or six years.

552
00:35:25,421 --> 00:35:27,890
Scott: Also, you know video games visual novel type thing.

553
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:28,954
Rym: Yeah, just nine nine.

554
00:35:28,994 --> 00:35:30,440
Rym: Whatever's is the one I always think of.

555
00:35:30,781 --> 00:35:36,919
Rym: Yeah, and the sequel to that but virtues last reward, but when we reviewed it We also said it kind of had a bokurano vibe.

556
00:35:37,361 --> 00:35:41,017
Rym: We weren't sure if it would be like this because bokurano is basically one of those ones.

557
00:35:41,077 --> 00:35:41,700
Scott: only good, right?

558
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:45,700
Scott: Yeah, you know these kids they're not completely separated from society in that one.

559
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:50,040
Scott: It's actually that's what make bokurano cool is that they sort of aren't separated from society.

560
00:35:50,221 --> 00:35:55,438
Scott: I like they go to like the military like yeah, like they go to the cops right away Yeah, well right away ish.

561
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:59,677
Rym: But yeah, basically they go as right away as you could like you can understand why someone would but it's still.

562
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:10,680
Scott: it's silly group Of varied characters that get into a predicament with a lot of specific rules Governing the scenario that they have to navigate and horrors and supernatural and you know, so sinister.

563
00:36:10,761 --> 00:36:12,090
Rym: They got to watch the whole thing.

564
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:13,420
Rym: I've seen the first five episodes.

565
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:22,718
Rym: I watched up to what I would only go in to describe no real spoilers as The the giant stuffed kappa with a real human face also in it like it's a half.

566
00:36:23,461 --> 00:36:28,156
Rym: It's half penguin half face, but like photo of a real person not even like drawn.

567
00:36:28,216 --> 00:36:29,240
Scott: Yeah the supernatural thing.

568
00:36:31,328 --> 00:36:33,188
Scott: but uh You don't need to watch anymore.

569
00:36:33,228 --> 00:36:33,510
Rym: You're good.

570
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:35,259
Rym: Yeah, I was gonna ask you should I finish it?

571
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,635
Scott: I'll tell you everything you need to know if you tell me more time.

572
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,646
Rym: Here's the thing from the first.

573
00:36:42,666 --> 00:36:43,790
Rym: this is another situation.

574
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:49,060
Rym: this happens to us kind of often where the first episode of a show Makes it look like it's gonna be real good.

575
00:36:49,241 --> 00:36:52,475
Scott: So the first episode of this show makes it look like about 80% good, right?

576
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:54,906
Scott: It sets you up in the scenario.

577
00:36:54,966 --> 00:36:58,340
Scott: These people are found on the internet about this hidden village.

578
00:36:58,621 --> 00:37:02,860
Scott: They're on a bus that they rented and like a tour group to go find it on an adventure.

579
00:37:03,061 --> 00:37:05,800
Rym: The bus is weird and they're sinister undertones, right?

580
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,433
Scott: They all want to escape their lives for some reasons.

581
00:37:08,473 --> 00:37:09,700
Scott: You got to learn about each character.

582
00:37:09,801 --> 00:37:15,911
Scott: The only thing about the first episode which holds true for the rest of the show Is that you know, you have a bunch of varied characters.

583
00:37:15,931 --> 00:37:17,116
Rym: I always say a bunch.

584
00:37:17,156 --> 00:37:18,160
Rym: It's not like a normal anime.

585
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,323
Rym: It's not like 9 or 10.

586
00:37:19,323 --> 00:37:20,888
Scott: It's like 30 20 or 30.

587
00:37:20,888 --> 00:37:22,352
Scott: There are 30 people.

588
00:37:22,593 --> 00:37:25,020
Rym: There's a lot plus all the new characters.

589
00:37:25,403 --> 00:37:34,315
Rym: Yeah, so but do you know the trope of these shows is like introduce all the characters give the Backstories and then the writing always seems to come down to well.

590
00:37:34,396 --> 00:37:35,400
Rym: these five are together.

591
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:40,860
Rym: So let's consult our sheet of their personalities and have them interact in a superficial way like those characters would interact.

592
00:37:41,442 --> 00:37:52,937
Rym: This show takes that to such an extreme that after the first episode I actually thought that this show is gonna be like what Nodeshiko was to.

593
00:37:53,018 --> 00:37:57,620
Rym: robot shows Gonna be like this is taking the piss out of the genre.

594
00:37:58,262 --> 00:38:04,880
Rym: But as I started watching more I worry that that is an unintentional side effect of the really bad writing.

595
00:38:04,966 --> 00:38:12,815
Scott: Yeah so the characters a lot of the characters are really really shallow and One-dimensional and really caricatures.

596
00:38:12,956 --> 00:38:13,800
Scott: almost yeah.

597
00:38:14,021 --> 00:38:22,004
Scott: Like, you know some of them get episodes that like explain their backstory and sort of give a reason for they're so dumb Like the surly guy.

598
00:38:22,205 --> 00:38:33,140
Rym: his backstory is I was doing an IT project and something went wrong Vaguely and I got chewed out by my bosses because of it and therefore why I want to run away from society.

599
00:38:33,361 --> 00:38:38,516
Scott: Yeah, and that's why you think I have this personality of being angry at everything like you think we're joking.

600
00:38:38,657 --> 00:38:39,680
Rym: That is literally it.

601
00:38:39,828 --> 00:38:44,391
Scott: Yeah It's a really shallow and not you know complex or interesting.

602
00:38:44,472 --> 00:38:47,399
Scott: and what makes it worse is that even though they show?

603
00:38:48,001 --> 00:38:58,326
Scott: Some of the characters pasts and the reasons for the way they are They the way they act is really exaggerated and hyperbolic Which is okay in some senses.

604
00:38:58,386 --> 00:39:01,720
Rym: cuz like one of them love piano love piano love love pond love pond.

605
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,270
Scott: Her backstory is like, you know, pretty serious.

606
00:39:04,571 --> 00:39:05,394
Scott: Did you see her backstory?

607
00:39:06,097 --> 00:39:06,318
Scott: No.

608
00:39:06,378 --> 00:39:06,900
Scott: All right, whatever.

609
00:39:07,141 --> 00:39:13,880
Scott: So her backstory is pretty serious and explains why the way she is, but basically all she does is be like execute people.

610
00:39:14,663 --> 00:39:15,547
Rym: He committed a crime.

611
00:39:15,567 --> 00:39:21,440
Scott: we should execute that guy and she's literally like hysterically screams Execute him execute him execute him constantly.

612
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:27,727
Rym: I know at least the show follows through on that because like in the third episode She does fucking try to murder someone.

613
00:39:27,847 --> 00:39:31,198
Scott: right but it's like just a basically a nut.

614
00:39:32,749 --> 00:39:37,540
Rym: She's just like Frantic not and only one who I don't think is a nut is lion.

615
00:39:38,082 --> 00:39:42,620
Scott: Anyway, and the other thing is that she they don't develop right further.

616
00:39:42,701 --> 00:39:44,480
Scott: It's like we learn love ponds backstory.

617
00:39:47,022 --> 00:39:48,127
Rym: They're all dead they're all dead.

618
00:39:48,147 --> 00:39:58,040
Scott: this is the afterlife no, but we see that she's fucked up now But then she doesn't change after that really very much at all only very slightly The only characters that have any development are like the few main ones.

619
00:39:58,167 --> 00:40:00,328
Rym: Yeah And you know what the main ones suck right.

620
00:40:00,368 --> 00:40:08,903
Scott: the main ones because that's the thing that happens in so many stories especially anime is the more main the character is the more Genero they are.

621
00:40:08,984 --> 00:40:13,256
Scott: because I there's some idea that writers have that the main character needs to be more relatable.

622
00:40:13,276 --> 00:40:15,806
Rym: the best example of this Ever is new to what I do.

623
00:40:15,987 --> 00:40:24,100
Rym: No, no, it's a bunch of great characters everywhere And then the main character is literally this vague masked dude with no history.

624
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:34,999
Scott: I think Fullmetal Alchemist is my favorite example because you have all these awesome characters like Hughes and Mustang and shit and Meanwhile, the main characters are like the twins are like the most boring.

625
00:40:36,141 --> 00:40:38,311
Rym: It's like they have some personality they have some.

626
00:40:38,331 --> 00:40:38,572
Scott: they're not.

627
00:40:38,592 --> 00:40:38,853
Scott: they're not.

628
00:40:38,933 --> 00:40:40,239
Rym: nothings right but it's like no.

629
00:40:40,723 --> 00:40:45,070
Rym: It's just like you pretend you're that guy But it's like, you know, I wish that the.

630
00:40:45,271 --> 00:40:47,139
Scott: they weren't even in it and it was about the.

631
00:40:47,299 --> 00:40:49,459
Scott: you know The other awesome, but like main kid number one.

632
00:40:49,801 --> 00:40:54,476
Rym: So again, if you watch just the first episode the show looks like it's gonna be so great cuz it.

633
00:40:54,697 --> 00:40:56,042
Scott: it looks like it's gonna Be okay.

634
00:40:56,062 --> 00:41:08,920
Rym: Well, it looks like it's gonna be great in this like nadeshko as deconstructive like the character intros Like it's almost like a parody because literally the bus driver is kind of crazy and like everything's weird.

635
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:12,592
Scott: The bus driver is actually the most normal person sinister, but he has issues too obviously.

636
00:41:12,612 --> 00:41:14,900
Rym: Not the bus driver the like the sugar bleeder?

637
00:41:15,061 --> 00:41:18,394
Rym: Oh, no, he's not but all the characters are like super into it.

638
00:41:18,575 --> 00:41:19,840
Scott: He's like he's like a Mormon type.

639
00:41:19,921 --> 00:41:29,946
Rym: They one by one introduced themselves and tell you their backstory or at least tell you something about themselves and that scene goes on for like 10 minutes as Pretty much the whole first episode.

640
00:41:30,146 --> 00:41:34,320
Rym: and that was great because some of the characters had like all this anime nonsense.

641
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:38,959
Rym: Some of them were obviously crazy like the one kids like I'm Jack and wouldn't talk anymore.

642
00:41:39,822 --> 00:41:42,572
Scott: But and then there's the other Jack who's dressed like a pirate or something.

643
00:41:42,692 --> 00:41:43,595
Rym: Jack and Jack.

644
00:41:43,655 --> 00:41:49,062
Rym: the characters keep confusing this but actually it's Jack and Judgeness.

645
00:41:49,645 --> 00:42:01,606
Rym: and just saying those words in Japanese they sound similar But it's Jack and Judgeness and these two characters keep fighting about how they have the same name and his bullshit like oh my god You stole my OC.

646
00:42:01,626 --> 00:42:05,485
Rym: Yeah, the characters are just so Stereotypical that the first episode.

647
00:42:05,826 --> 00:42:09,396
Rym: I really believe that this show was taking that concept of.

648
00:42:09,416 --> 00:42:12,690
Rym: we've got nine characters the mysterious Backstories and just saying fuck it.

649
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:17,288
Rym: We got I don't know 30 and One of them's like literally just got guns.

650
00:42:17,589 --> 00:42:19,376
Rym: One of them is like literally a demon.

651
00:42:19,396 --> 00:42:20,540
Rym: Let's just fucking go nuts.

652
00:42:21,422 --> 00:42:23,167
Rym: I thought that's what the show was gonna be.

653
00:42:23,187 --> 00:42:28,665
Rym: Mmm the fact that the show is actually just badly written and trying to do this They do find a mysterious village.

654
00:42:28,685 --> 00:42:34,614
Scott: That's Mysterious right because it's empty but it's not like it.

655
00:42:34,755 --> 00:42:35,760
Scott: nothing's destroyed.

656
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:42,365
Scott: it's just like it looks like the people have recently departed and left everything there and It's like what's going on here?

657
00:42:42,867 --> 00:42:52,076
Scott: And then as they stay there and sort of try to start a new life, you know of Solitude one by one characters scream and freak out for no reason at nothing.

658
00:42:52,116 --> 00:43:08,040
Scott: people disappear People, you know discover weird things people go off into the woods and shit happens, but it's also dumb which again I. but it alternates as you would expect between Characters sitting around discussing things like a lot in a very Death Note kind of way.

659
00:43:08,381 --> 00:43:13,480
Scott: Oh, imagine if L was a bunch of characters like oh is that person up isn't up to no good?

660
00:43:13,561 --> 00:43:14,680
Scott: No, that person's up to no good.

661
00:43:14,861 --> 00:43:19,360
Scott: Oh that but that person went into the woods and did and that person wants to leave and that person does again.

662
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:19,542
Rym: why?

663
00:43:19,562 --> 00:43:20,837
Rym: I thought it was gonna be a parody.

664
00:43:20,918 --> 00:43:34,280
Rym: because And then stuff happens and then they talk again and it's like The stuff that happens was like really dumb and they were all overreacting pretty much every time up until Overact about everything but to the argue like the discussions.

665
00:43:34,501 --> 00:43:36,226
Scott: Why don't you tell us you must be no good?

666
00:43:36,708 --> 00:43:45,319
Rym: the discussions they had were so dumb and fake Like our group of friends playing mafia sounds more together than these kids.

667
00:43:45,399 --> 00:43:46,288
Scott: Yes It was like.

668
00:43:46,369 --> 00:43:52,526
Rym: it's like a bad game Like at one point I can't start singing a song and there's someone else is like That's not the lyrics aren't the lyrics?

669
00:43:52,567 --> 00:43:52,787
Rym: this?

670
00:43:52,968 --> 00:43:59,712
Rym: and then some other kids like I thought the lyrics were this and that's what they have This discussion about that just as seriously as well.

671
00:43:59,993 --> 00:44:01,076
Rym: So-and-so was murdered.

672
00:44:01,137 --> 00:44:02,100
Rym: So who could have done it?

673
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:03,688
Rym: Well, so-and-so was somewhere else.

674
00:44:03,909 --> 00:44:04,312
Scott: you were like.

675
00:44:04,332 --> 00:44:05,740
Scott: you were the last person to see them.

676
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:06,423
Scott: What happened?

677
00:44:06,684 --> 00:44:09,740
Scott: and we're gonna torture you and make you tell us the best one is the paper-rock-scissors.

678
00:44:09,921 --> 00:44:13,140
Rym: They start arguing for like five minutes about how paper-rock-scissors works.

679
00:44:13,284 --> 00:44:23,034
Rym: Yeah so all those things led me to believe that this is a parody and if it is if at least from the first couple episodes if This is a parody of that kind of show.

680
00:44:23,115 --> 00:44:29,076
Rym: No, it's brilliant No, but as you have just informed me one appears it was released on April Fool's Day.

681
00:44:29,096 --> 00:44:30,400
Scott: I didn't know about that.

682
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,444
Rym: That's when it started airing.

683
00:44:31,765 --> 00:44:35,680
Scott: So even better, but I mean baby metals album came out in April first.

684
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:46,054
Rym: But if this show is actually seriously going to try to for real This show is terrible and I'm not gonna watch anymore.

685
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:47,240
Scott: you don't need to watch anymore.

686
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:50,029
Scott: So they do resolve and explain everything.

687
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:50,611
Rym: is it dumb?

688
00:44:50,772 --> 00:44:56,992
Scott: It's a supernatural explanation as a guest But it doesn't.

689
00:44:57,314 --> 00:44:57,758
Scott: there's no.

690
00:44:57,798 --> 00:45:05,205
Scott: like Climax or like satisfying resolution is just sort of like it goes out with like a whimper like yeah Here's the only question I have.

691
00:45:05,707 --> 00:45:07,473
Rym: is lion the only smart one?

692
00:45:07,734 --> 00:45:09,380
Scott: lions barely a character like a side.

693
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:13,840
Rym: Yeah, that's why I think lions the smartest one because lion seem personality seems to be sitting there.

694
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:24,640
Scott: Yeah lion and then like that that there's like a group of line and like two or three strong girl strong girl lion Strong girl and like two other people there's you know, they're still around I think in the last episode.

695
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:28,446
Scott: They're on screen for like all right Does the guy they're like?

696
00:45:28,486 --> 00:45:29,248
Scott: they're like the least.

697
00:45:29,469 --> 00:45:31,374
Scott: there's some they're amongst the least crazy people.

698
00:45:31,435 --> 00:45:34,168
Rym: does the rapey guy from the first episode who disappears die?

699
00:45:34,249 --> 00:45:37,263
Scott: rapey guy is He's still missing.

700
00:45:37,303 --> 00:45:38,809
Rym: when I stopped why I know he is.

701
00:45:39,009 --> 00:45:42,040
Scott: he is only half as rapey as you think and he is not dead.

702
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:45,764
Scott: Okay But and he only comes back in like one episode Fat guy has to die.

703
00:45:45,804 --> 00:45:48,997
Rym: cuz fat guy literally just eats food all the time and bitches about food.

704
00:45:49,197 --> 00:45:49,860
Scott: lazy fat guy.

705
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:52,571
Scott: Yeah, he basically all he's just lazy fat guy to the end.

706
00:45:52,611 --> 00:45:52,912
Scott: That's it.

707
00:45:53,354 --> 00:45:54,700
Scott: There's nothing else going on with him.

708
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:55,303
Scott: He's just sort of like.

709
00:45:55,344 --> 00:45:56,068
Scott: they're like up.

710
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:56,309
Scott: Yep.

711
00:45:56,350 --> 00:45:58,100
Scott: He's a background character.

712
00:45:58,381 --> 00:46:02,838
Scott: There's something to be said for the same thing with like the two people who are all like super in love same deal.

713
00:46:02,858 --> 00:46:05,068
Rym: Wow Those two reminded they're like.

714
00:46:05,268 --> 00:46:06,775
Scott: they're like nothing throwaway characters.

715
00:46:06,916 --> 00:46:07,840
Scott: They were like in the show.

716
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:10,931
Rym: They were like shit-tier versions of the two characters from.

717
00:46:11,031 --> 00:46:16,839
Scott: it would have been something if they gave every character a full Episode to explain their backstory the way they gave some of the characters.

718
00:46:18,081 --> 00:46:19,324
Scott: But it's like love.

719
00:46:19,344 --> 00:46:29,986
Scott: fun isn't any more of an important character than any of them fat guy or in love people or anything but for some reason they gave her an old episode to explain her shit and Some of the other characters.

720
00:46:30,006 --> 00:46:30,367
Scott: they didn't.

721
00:46:30,488 --> 00:46:33,660
Scott: but she has maybe even less impact on the story than they do.

722
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,385
Rym: It's just like just from the first episode.

723
00:46:35,426 --> 00:46:36,088
Rym: like I guess.

724
00:46:36,228 --> 00:46:43,019
Rym: my advice to all of you as anime fans watch the first episode Because like watch it don't watch any more of the show.

725
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:47,140
Rym: Pretend it was a parody of these kinds of shows and you'll get a lot out of it.

726
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:50,851
Rym: I think man, maybe the first episode is really good.

727
00:46:50,871 --> 00:46:52,898
Rym: It's kind of like Kazunoyo Jimbo.

728
00:46:52,918 --> 00:46:53,680
Rym: You watch the first episode.

729
00:46:53,962 --> 00:46:55,859
Scott: This isn't like the worst anime ever.

730
00:46:55,980 --> 00:47:00,820
Scott: It's just not really worth your time even for 13 episodes unless you're really hard up for some anime.

731
00:47:00,921 --> 00:47:01,550
Scott: It's.

732
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:02,180
Rym: maybe you can make.

733
00:47:03,221 --> 00:47:06,993
Scott: At least it's not perverted or you know, it doesn't have any of those kinds of problems.

734
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:15,900
Rym: Yeah, you know, it's I guess it's animated Normally, what if you just cut out every scene where either nothing happens or a character says their catchphrase?

735
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:16,813
Rym: How long would the show be?

736
00:47:18,181 --> 00:47:18,988
Scott: Maybe 25% shorter than it is.

737
00:47:21,042 --> 00:47:22,471
Rym: So that means a lot of like.

738
00:47:22,753 --> 00:47:31,240
Rym: alright in the fourth episode I'll just spoil it and one like they're like they have this stupid plan they like split up because some of them gonna go back to the bus and I don't know why they think that's gonna work.

739
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:33,308
Rym: is The bus like fell off a cliff and like isn't?

740
00:47:33,368 --> 00:47:36,560
Scott: for some reason the bus keeps working and never runs out of gas or anything.

741
00:47:36,721 --> 00:47:44,325
Scott: It never runs out of gas and never fill it But it just keeps running whenever they need it like whenever the bus keeps doing stuff But it's in.

742
00:47:44,385 --> 00:47:45,811
Scott: it's in the show straight to the end the.

743
00:47:45,871 --> 00:47:54,900
Rym: but then like they're half the group is like fuck this We're out which when they split into two groups It was obviously like smart kids on that team dumb kids on the stay behind team.

744
00:47:55,582 --> 00:48:00,060
Rym: But the smart kids start numbering the trees like walking away and that's the kind of thing that happens in this kind of show.

745
00:48:00,564 --> 00:48:02,119
Rym: So they're numbering the trees on the map.

746
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:03,865
Scott: They get to tree like 91 and then they get to tree eight.

747
00:48:03,885 --> 00:48:04,025
Rym: Mm-hmm.

748
00:48:04,046 --> 00:48:11,999
Rym: So They got back to the campsite pretty quick.

749
00:48:12,906 --> 00:48:20,274
Rym: So it couldn't have been that Someone tricked them by putting an eight there way out on the map, but the map match the.

750
00:48:20,756 --> 00:48:22,320
Rym: so was it just a supernatural thing?

751
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:23,283
Rym: Because it didn't make sense.

752
00:48:23,323 --> 00:48:28,440
Scott: Otherwise, I mean I'd have to explain the whole show which I don't mind doing but people get mad.

753
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,048
Scott: So whatever and I want to go home.

754
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:32,039
Rym: Yeah, I don't even care.

755
00:48:32,139 --> 00:48:35,716
Rym: actually It's interesting like some dumb shows like I'll watch the end cuz I gotta know.

756
00:48:36,138 --> 00:48:43,570
Rym: but like Part of the reason I kept going was like I really wanted to know and it was taking me longer to figure out But I don't want to know.

757
00:48:43,631 --> 00:48:44,700
Scott: read 15 books badly.

758
00:48:44,981 --> 00:48:51,383
Rym: It took me like like I read a bunch of Wikipedia pages to spoil the wheel of time and it was so hard to piece It all together from that.

759
00:48:51,403 --> 00:48:52,968
Rym: It was literally faster to read the books.

760
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:58,726
Rym: But with this show I just Watch the first episode.

761
00:48:58,766 --> 00:49:01,559
Rym: I really think you should watch the first episode to at least see what I mean.

762
00:49:01,982 --> 00:49:03,958
Scott: I mean, you don't need to watch that just watch Boker on.

763
00:49:03,998 --> 00:49:13,377
Rym: Oh instead the first episode was interest like the fact that all the characters were like their screen names and Every one of them was like a different kind of that guy from the internet.

764
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:19,099
Rym: and Yeah, whatever the show has got bad and I'm not gonna watch any more of it.

765
00:49:20,601 --> 00:49:21,886
Rym: We said the show was gonna be good.

766
00:49:21,906 --> 00:49:23,150
Scott: Yeah, it was.

767
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:23,411
Scott: it was.

768
00:49:23,792 --> 00:49:25,820
Scott: it was better than most the other shows out there.

769
00:49:26,342 --> 00:49:27,909
Rym: Yeah, but I feel like of the shows.

770
00:49:27,969 --> 00:49:36,224
Scott: we said we're going to be like it's like a C. This was the big plus maybe C - so far of every show we had in your mood Pre-reviewed.

771
00:49:36,244 --> 00:49:39,880
Rym: this has been the biggest gap between what we expected and what we got.

772
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:40,706
Scott: I didn't say I never.

773
00:49:41,129 --> 00:49:42,560
Scott: I never said it was gonna be like so good.

774
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:47,760
Rym: I said I have potential which we said had a lot of potential but it fell so far short of that potential.

775
00:49:47,941 --> 00:49:50,854
Scott: I mean it fell short of expectations, but only slightly.

776
00:49:50,875 --> 00:49:53,508
Scott: Yeah Expectation wasn't that high.

777
00:49:53,528 --> 00:49:54,799
Scott: my expectation was B and it got a C.

778
00:49:55,321 --> 00:49:59,457
Rym: Yeah, but C gets you already into like Armageddon territory.

779
00:49:59,617 --> 00:50:04,100
Rym: So It's better than harm again, actually, I think harm again might be like a B minus.

780
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:10,051
Rym: I'm again might be more entertaining in certain scenario Like this gets less entertaining every minute that it goes on.

781
00:50:10,111 --> 00:50:12,620
Scott: Yeah, don't come to the show for entertainment value.

782
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:13,483
Scott: You're not gonna get that.

783
00:50:13,623 --> 00:50:15,028
Rym: Yeah now I've now.

784
00:50:15,068 --> 00:50:20,749
Rym: I started scrolling through reviews and the people who say it's great Clearly haven't seen a lot of anime.

785
00:50:21,171 --> 00:50:30,451
Rym: and the people who say it's bad or no Sorry, the people who say it's great either haven't seen a lot of anime or they're basically saying it's a shitty B Movie that goes on forever.

786
00:50:30,511 --> 00:50:34,832
Rym: if you like shitty B movies You'll love the shit out of it does have that kind of feel like and you'll enjoy it.

787
00:50:35,174 --> 00:50:38,179
Rym: if you're literally in it to see How bad the script is written?

788
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:42,553
Scott: Yeah which it has that kind of feel for sure like I've enjoyed things on that level before.

789
00:50:42,613 --> 00:50:44,881
Rym: so I can see that a poorly paced B Movie.

790
00:50:44,982 --> 00:50:51,880
Rym: the people who say it's bad seem to be split between people who say they don't get it And there's nothing not to get if you don't get it.

791
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:52,745
Scott: It's a isn't a show.

792
00:50:53,308 --> 00:50:58,614
Scott: it spells it all out for you and near the end They just tell you everything literally and the anime news network forums.

793
00:50:58,875 --> 00:51:03,311
Rym: like in the episode 5 I found a thread where like the giant Kappa gets revealed.

794
00:51:03,472 --> 00:51:04,094
Scott: It's not a Kappa.

795
00:51:04,134 --> 00:51:05,900
Scott: It's a half penguin half person.

796
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:08,531
Rym: But it's got the bald-headed Kappa looking thing on it.

797
00:51:08,872 --> 00:51:09,314
Scott: It's nice.

798
00:51:09,354 --> 00:51:09,876
Scott: No capper.

799
00:51:09,896 --> 00:51:10,639
Rym: So it's a penguin.

800
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,608
Scott: It's half stuffed penguin half person.

801
00:51:12,668 --> 00:51:15,300
Rym: because at first I thought it was a penguin, but then I saw the bald head thing.

802
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:19,359
Rym: I was like, oh, I guess it's just bald and a Japanese guy with like a thin mustache coming in.

803
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:20,738
Rym: Yeah, whatever like a photo of him.

804
00:51:21,101 --> 00:51:25,640
Rym: But like in the fourth episode they go into the train track tunnel and I'm like alright tunnels a big deal.

805
00:51:25,821 --> 00:51:28,674
Rym: But then the kid the one girl the guys that got the flashlight.

806
00:51:28,694 --> 00:51:31,066
Rym: He's like, oh my god There's some crazy shit.

807
00:51:31,268 --> 00:51:33,339
Rym: and then they all scream and run away without saying what it is.

808
00:51:33,741 --> 00:51:38,076
Rym: But then when they get back to camp, they're like it was a giant like main character.

809
00:51:38,096 --> 00:51:40,733
Rym: Yeah the that's not.

810
00:51:40,773 --> 00:51:43,903
Rym: that is literally The second.

811
00:51:43,923 --> 00:51:47,713
Rym: to last thing I would have expected them to have seen screamed and run away from.

812
00:51:47,733 --> 00:51:50,719
Rym: on my list was number one train.

813
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:53,509
Rym: Number two ghost train.

814
00:51:54,011 --> 00:51:55,277
Scott: ghost train would have made the show great.

815
00:51:55,478 --> 00:51:58,107
Rym: Yeah Number three the bear monster.

816
00:51:58,127 --> 00:51:58,890
Scott: that would have been great.

817
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:01,879
Rym: to number four like mirrors of all the other kids.

818
00:52:03,142 --> 00:52:11,985
Rym: But at near the bottom of the list was things like actual Freddy Krueger black dynamite Evangelion but black dynamite.

819
00:52:12,085 --> 00:52:14,954
Rym: Yeah, like literally it's Hideaki Anno.

820
00:52:15,034 --> 00:52:19,740
Rym: like he is a character in the show now But right at the bottom that's blue blazes.

821
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:28,013
Rym: You should watch that right at the very bottom down there is a bigger version of one of the characters four meters tall.

822
00:52:28,053 --> 00:52:30,364
Rym: give or take Whatever.

823
00:52:30,767 --> 00:52:31,553
Rym: don't watch this show.

824
00:52:31,574 --> 00:52:32,279
Rym: Just watch the free stuff.

825
00:52:38,263 --> 00:52:40,800
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

826
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:45,580
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

Scott: crew calm for show notes discussion news and more.

831
00:53:03,401 --> 00:53:06,490
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

832
00:53:06,691 --> 00:53:08,155
Scott: But unlike those other late shows.

833
00:53:08,296 --> 00:53:09,599
Scott: It's actually recorded at night.

834
00:53:22,934 --> 00:54:06,110
Rym: the patrons for this episode of GeekNights in Decreasing amount of money that they send us on a continuing basis are Alan Joyce, Rebecca Dunn, Nicholas Brando, Heidi McNichol, Amanda Duchette, James David White, Christian Koontz, construction noises, mystady.com, Sean Hayworth, William Isenbroughs, Jeremy Miner, Chris Reimer, and Thomas Hahn, Devin Goodman, Iggy Kid, Matthew Smith, Kshar Tavashin, Joshua Joestar, Tyler Eller, Don Schleig, Sean Yeager, Clinton Walton, Ren from New Zealand, Robert Lee, Ryan Perrin, Drew Openlander, Rare Lavelle, Brian Cidroni, Rochelle Montanona, Finn, Eric Silverard, Chris Reimer, and Thomas Hahn, Erin Cerise, Chris Midkiff, Chris Knox, Flame Darkfire, and me, Dio Sam Cordery, Daniel Redmond, Shawn Klein, Chris Reimer, and Thomas Hahn.

835
00:54:07,291 --> 00:54:10,323
Rym: It's like pulling teeth to get Scott to do the Q&A episodes.

836
00:54:10,363 --> 00:54:22,090
Rym: We were gonna record the Q&A for the previous month now But we had to edit the show at the normal time instead of going late Partly because one of our bunnies is a little sick and we got to do some medicine and take care of him.

837
00:54:22,251 --> 00:54:23,770
Rym: So that that's the reason for the delay.

838
00:54:24,314 --> 00:54:31,510
Rym: But what I'm gonna do for the June Q&A Partly because I just want to see this happen once is I'm gonna open it up to all the patrons.

839
00:54:31,912 --> 00:54:35,390
Rym: But they'll only have like a couple days to submit their questions.

840
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:45,670
Rym: But I will make sure that anyone who is a $5 or above patron Your questions get asked first and then we'll let all the plebs and we'll make it clear who's the plebs.

841
00:54:45,751 --> 00:54:47,630
Rym: You guys still get your privilege, but don't worry.

842
00:54:47,972 --> 00:54:50,910
Rym: Generally, you've got to be at that tier to answer ask questions normally.

843
00:54:51,355 --> 00:55:09,224
Rym: but that's sort of a Throwout to all the people who give us a dollar because honestly I'd rather see a world where all our listeners give us a dollar and Nobody gives us more than a dollar because that would actually be a lot of money and we could do stuff with it Otherwise, the only other update is that the money has not been spent on anything yet.

844
00:55:09,385 --> 00:55:10,590
Rym: I haven't even taken it from patreon.

845
00:55:10,731 --> 00:55:18,985
Rym: it's just sitting there waiting for its project and The potential projects are coming and doing a big show at PAX Australia.

846
00:55:19,085 --> 00:55:34,010
Rym: I'm talking to some people about that Potentially buying a significant amount of further equipment to start really cranking out videos or Straight up starting a small gaming convention in downstate New York like for real a two-day convention.

847
00:55:34,853 --> 00:55:39,088
Rym: The way it would work would be pretty much to start it was Saturday and Sunday.

848
00:55:39,209 --> 00:55:41,950
Rym: only Saturday would be sort of an open gaming thing.

849
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:46,170
Rym: There'd be a keynote like one sort of like keynote like so we do like an intro thing.

850
00:55:46,471 --> 00:55:58,270
Rym: There'd be a keynote from someone kind of serious and then it would just be open gaming and tournaments all day Probably like one tabletop area in one video game in area and then Sunday would be the same convention.

851
00:55:58,751 --> 00:56:00,035
Rym: But it's a curated event.

852
00:56:00,376 --> 00:56:02,543
Rym: an example of the kind of curated event.

853
00:56:02,563 --> 00:56:04,910
Rym: We would do would be like burning con.

854
00:56:05,392 --> 00:56:07,502
Rym: So basically it would be like an example.

855
00:56:07,522 --> 00:56:12,139
Rym: con would be Saturday's the game day Sunday for everyone who's still in for it for that.

856
00:56:12,159 --> 00:56:15,510
Rym: It would be like a one-day version of burning con.

857
00:56:16,232 --> 00:56:18,818
Rym: That's what we're looking at doing and there's a chance.

858
00:56:18,858 --> 00:56:23,250
Rym: We'll use the patreon money to do the groundwork to make that happen.

859
00:56:24,015 --> 00:56:25,364
Rym: So stay tuned.

860
00:56:25,384 --> 00:56:26,189
Rym: We're working on it.

861
00:56:26,471 --> 00:56:31,510
Rym: We got to make sure Connecticut happens before we do our own con, but stay tuned for real.

862
00:56:32,032 --> 00:57:29,325
Rym: But anyway now I leave you with something odd With But your head gets done You.
