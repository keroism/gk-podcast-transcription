1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,524
Rym: It's Monday January 11th 2016.

2
00:00:12,524 --> 00:00:13,065
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,587 --> 00:00:15,875
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:16,175 --> 00:00:23,560
Rym: nuclear vessels Not to get into the details because it's more of a metamoment thing, but we got a lot of conventions coming up.

5
00:00:23,821 --> 00:00:27,973
Scott: I know one convention per month for January February March April.

6
00:00:27,993 --> 00:00:29,498
Rym: Yeah, and I've got more.

7
00:00:29,618 --> 00:00:32,014
Rym: and south Yeah, egg fest egg fest.

8
00:00:32,277 --> 00:00:36,920
Rym: then We've got a Zenkai con Pax East anime Boston, I forgot about Zenkai con.

9
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,890
Scott: Yeah, maybe five conventions.

10
00:00:38,911 --> 00:00:40,680
Rym: Well, you said you might skip at a Zenkai con.

11
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,794
Scott: So I technically skipped a lot of Zenkai cons.

12
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:43,640
Scott: Why not skip some more?

13
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,590
Rym: I did tactically put in panels that I could do on my own.

14
00:00:46,971 --> 00:00:50,423
Rym: Mm-hmm cuz I'm and also I'm only going Saturday and Sunday I'm not going Friday.

15
00:00:50,744 --> 00:00:50,845
Rym: Mmm.

16
00:00:51,045 --> 00:00:57,707
Rym: I'm praying to head out like Friday night like after work in the Amtrak cuz Bolt buses don't go to Lancaster.

17
00:00:57,928 --> 00:01:01,800
Rym: No one goes and there is an Amtrak station actually near the convention center.

18
00:01:01,941 --> 00:01:02,726
Scott: It's just down the street.

19
00:01:02,907 --> 00:01:03,793
Scott: It's a straight shot.

20
00:01:03,894 --> 00:01:04,760
Rym: So I could live with that.

21
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,519
Scott: I could live with that as long as it's not too cold.

22
00:01:06,861 --> 00:01:12,545
Rym: So I bitch a lot on the show about how there's no phone for me And you know, I want to buy the experience.

23
00:01:12,565 --> 00:01:19,084
Rym: the Sony Xperia z5 compact is probably the best cell phone hardware In the world.

24
00:01:19,124 --> 00:01:21,873
Rym: if you want to run Android, it's waterproof like everything about.

25
00:01:21,893 --> 00:01:23,860
Scott: does it run the newest Android without any bullshit?

26
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,044
Scott: 6.0.

27
00:01:25,044 --> 00:01:25,826
Scott: Also, it's Sony.

28
00:01:26,288 --> 00:01:30,060
Rym: Yeah, it's 6.0 troubling with some Sony bullshit in it, right?

29
00:01:30,462 --> 00:01:31,947
Scott: A lot you don't trust Lenovo.

30
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:37,809
Scott: you're gonna trust Sony who is the first to put like, you know Evil spyware DRM on us on an audio CD.

31
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:38,331
Scott: You know what?

32
00:01:38,512 --> 00:01:40,800
Rym: I do trust Sony more than I trust Lenovo.

33
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,788
Rym: Sony's malware is at least well constructed.

34
00:01:45,269 --> 00:01:48,238
Scott: So yeah, Sony actually has like the best cameras right now.

35
00:01:48,298 --> 00:01:49,060
Rym: Yeah, that's the problem.

36
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,043
Rym: So he has really good heart.

37
00:01:50,304 --> 00:01:56,580
Rym: if Sony could be split into a hardware company and a bullshit company I feel like Sony do real well.

38
00:01:56,821 --> 00:01:59,068
Scott: Yeah, just sell your hardware with no software on it whatsoever.

39
00:01:59,128 --> 00:02:04,325
Scott: people will take the Sony a7s camera and it'll just run Android instead of Whatever that garbage it runs.

40
00:02:04,365 --> 00:02:07,496
Rym: now, you don't understand how good that z5 compact is.

41
00:02:07,556 --> 00:02:08,740
Rym: is a phone like it's so good?

42
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,425
Scott: Could it be?

43
00:02:09,668 --> 00:02:13,130
Scott: it's also tiny Better than iPhone 5.

44
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:20,114
Rym: I say well the thing is I gets hard to compare Apples to androids because the OS like the experience is so different.

45
00:02:20,174 --> 00:02:26,620
Rym: So in terms of hardware though I think it's better than the iPhone 5 better than the iPod mini the iPod nano.

46
00:02:27,721 --> 00:02:30,170
Rym: That might actually be too small for a phone right now.

47
00:02:30,491 --> 00:02:33,160
Rym: Well, I could have a separate screen like on my wrist like a big screen.

48
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,183
Scott: What's the problem?

49
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:39,878
Rym: that I could not play nourishing my hacks on a like 40 by 40 screen.

50
00:02:40,058 --> 00:02:40,500
Scott: That's fine.

51
00:02:41,741 --> 00:02:48,462
Rym: Anyway, and there's a rumor that's pretty substantiated that there's gonna be Another.

52
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:51,411
Rym: there's gonna be a third pillar of the iPhone land.

53
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:54,280
Rym: There's gonna be the iPhone C class devices.

54
00:02:54,581 --> 00:02:55,425
Scott: Well, they already have that.

55
00:02:55,465 --> 00:02:57,554
Rym: they had an iPhone 5c and then they got rid of it.

56
00:02:58,397 --> 00:02:58,819
Scott: I think you can.

57
00:02:58,980 --> 00:02:59,823
Scott: Can you still get it?

58
00:03:00,386 --> 00:03:01,892
Rym: It's not they're not making them anymore.

59
00:03:01,912 --> 00:03:03,720
Rym: And let me check the Apple store.

60
00:03:04,102 --> 00:03:06,120
Rym: It was widely considered to be a failure.

61
00:03:06,422 --> 00:03:09,480
Scott: Oh, we have a lot of them at work and a lot of my co-workers bought him and loved them.

62
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:19,300
Rym: Oh, yeah, so some of them still use them widely considered to be a failure, but Apparently they have a deep fandom among people who wanted a smaller phone.

63
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:30,641
Scott: so right now the iPhones you can get that are currently in production are the six six s and Five s which is just an iPhone 5 pretty much which is slightly better I guess.

64
00:03:31,223 --> 00:03:35,438
Rym: so the the iPhone 6c or it might be a 7c.

65
00:03:35,498 --> 00:03:36,100
Rym: We're not sure.

66
00:03:36,542 --> 00:03:37,566
Scott: This is the year of iPhone 7.

67
00:03:37,566 --> 00:03:38,591
Scott: So it's September.

68
00:03:38,611 --> 00:03:40,078
Scott: They're gonna announce the iPhone 7.

69
00:03:40,078 --> 00:03:40,439
Scott: I'll get it.

70
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,218
Rym: So the rumor is unless April or May they might announce the 6c.

71
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,683
Scott: That's a big deal.

72
00:03:46,723 --> 00:03:52,181
Scott: and it makes this rumor less credible because the iPhones have been on a September schedule for years yes,

73
00:03:52,302 --> 00:04:01,771
Rym: and the rumor is that the C devices are gonna be on their own separate schedule and Partly because of lackluster iPhone sales from the previous they

74
00:04:01,851 --> 00:04:11,077
Scott: did decrease orders on iPhones to you know the manufacturers in China recently because basically we're at a point where everyone's just fucking got a phone and the phones are lasting longer.

75
00:04:11,097 --> 00:04:16,640
Rym: if you've got like an iPhone 6s a lot of people have no reason to get the 7 when it comes out, right?

76
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:22,560
Scott: It's like well, I mean if you have iPhone 5 like you're still fucking good today And iPhone 5s iPhone 4 is even good today.

77
00:04:22,621 --> 00:04:23,226
Scott: So it's okay.

78
00:04:23,387 --> 00:04:28,320
Scott: people are good with phones for now Like they're not buying iPhone 6s and 6s is at the rate that they expected.

79
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:37,620
Scott: So like they got workers who are just like at home not working over in China not making iPhones because Apple's like we don't need Anymore only order this many and androids the same way.

80
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,953
Rym: I mean I'm using a Nexus 5 and you know what.

81
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:43,082
Rym: there is no better Android phone Like.

82
00:04:43,102 --> 00:04:50,440
Rym: sure you could get a 5x But there is nothing better in the 5x as far as any user of a phone except Conrad would care about.

83
00:04:51,426 --> 00:04:59,654
Rym: so The rumor is that they're gonna release this iPhone 6 ish hardware in a size.

84
00:04:59,715 --> 00:05:02,797
Rym: the rumor ranges from iPod touch.

85
00:05:03,502 --> 00:05:04,585
Rym: That's the perfect touch.

86
00:05:04,646 --> 00:05:06,612
Scott: We have an iPod touch at work the newest one.

87
00:05:06,632 --> 00:05:08,036
Scott: Yeah, it's incredible.

88
00:05:08,097 --> 00:05:09,080
Scott: Yeah, so good.

89
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,880
Scott: So the size the shape the thin everything about it is a mirror is a miracle.

90
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,773
Rym: There's a credible rumor that it's gonna be that size.

91
00:05:15,813 --> 00:05:16,697
Rym: give or take a millimeter.

92
00:05:16,737 --> 00:05:17,440
Scott: I'll pay for that.

93
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,340
Scott: Okay, I'll pay more for the smaller one.

94
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,537
Rym: so the biggest that it would be appears to be an iPhone 4.

95
00:05:23,537 --> 00:05:26,607
Scott: that's iPhone 4 was the perfect size.

96
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:28,335
Scott: iPhone 5 had a better screen.

97
00:05:28,356 --> 00:05:32,452
Scott: It was a better device But compared to the iPhone 4 it was thinner, which is good.

98
00:05:32,492 --> 00:05:34,700
Scott: The thinness is better, but it was it was too long.

99
00:05:36,864 --> 00:05:38,860
Rym: Look at that comparison, that's the phone.

100
00:05:39,343 --> 00:05:41,155
Scott: The iPhone 5 was too long.

101
00:05:41,195 --> 00:05:42,242
Scott: the iPhone, you know It was like.

102
00:05:42,262 --> 00:05:45,320
Scott: I want the iPhone 5 but just not as long as the iPhone 5.

103
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:50,200
Scott: I'm gonna be iPhone 4 height, but with all the stuff that was in the iPhone 5 only probably faster nowadays.

104
00:05:50,341 --> 00:05:51,525
Scott: Yeah, that's also.

105
00:05:52,168 --> 00:05:55,440
Rym: it looks like they're gonna ditch the plastic cuz they made him kind of like colorful.

106
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:56,906
Scott: I like the color of a plastic.

107
00:05:57,087 --> 00:05:59,296
Rym: They're gonna have the same metal as every other iPhone.

108
00:05:59,356 --> 00:06:00,260
Scott: I want colors though.

109
00:06:00,601 --> 00:06:02,228
Rym: Yeah, well, they'll have the green color.

110
00:06:02,268 --> 00:06:02,730
Rym: green me.

111
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,196
Rym: They probably won't have rose gold.

112
00:06:04,216 --> 00:06:05,320
Rym: They'll probably keep that there.

113
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,908
Scott: I don't wanna bullshit rose gold.

114
00:06:06,948 --> 00:06:09,240
Scott: I always get the boring gray one, but that's cuz there's no green.

115
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:11,748
Rym: Yeah, if there was a there was like a metal green.

116
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:15,138
Rym: green me up Scott the Xperia's have a green option.

117
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:15,700
Scott: big deal.

118
00:06:15,821 --> 00:06:18,800
Scott: Hey, it doesn't help but everything behind the green is garbage.

119
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:27,943
Rym: He is the only reason I didn't get a z5c now because you can get a gray market one in the US even though it's not released in the US and confirmed Android 6.

120
00:06:27,943 --> 00:06:31,940
Rym: The only reason I didn't get one is that because it's the international edition.

121
00:06:32,503 --> 00:06:37,779
Rym: It's missing two or three LTE channels Which wouldn't matter that much?

122
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:43,559
Rym: Except most of the new coverage that t-mobile and other people are putting out is in those bands in the u.s.

123
00:06:43,881 --> 00:06:47,276
Scott: Well, you can't be using t-mobile now that the CEO is like EFF.

124
00:06:47,296 --> 00:06:48,100
Scott: Who the fuck is that?

125
00:06:48,481 --> 00:06:50,800
Rym: Yeah, so we'll see what I do with phones.

126
00:06:51,482 --> 00:06:52,505
Rym: You can read these rumors.

127
00:06:52,525 --> 00:07:07,920
Rym: the iPhone 6c will probably come out ahead of the iPhone 7 to get a sales bump Because then they expect that a bunch of people will buy that who will otherwise wouldn't have upgraded during the seven cycle Because there's a bigger demand for a small phone than people realize.

128
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,020
Scott: I can't do anything until the iPhone 7 comes out in September October.

129
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:15,095
Rym: I the rumors also that it's gonna be cheaper like a lot cheaper, but not cheap.

130
00:07:15,496 --> 00:07:25,218
Scott: Well, it doesn't matter Talking like 400 ish bucks That's a good deal, which is still like especially now since the subsidies and contracts are all gone now in the US.

131
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:29,540
Scott: Goodbye I mean, but I think that's also what's hurting new iPhone sales.

132
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:29,942
Scott: Is that?

133
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:32,935
Scott: is that as people need to buy iPhones now and they're like, oh $800 fuck that.

134
00:07:34,401 --> 00:07:35,887
Rym: Yeah, I think what also is hurting?

135
00:07:35,927 --> 00:07:42,199
Rym: that honestly the hardware on phones is good enough for 99.9% of what anyone does with them.

136
00:07:42,501 --> 00:07:46,718
Rym: The only limiting factor that anyone gives a shit about is either the size or the battery life.

137
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:48,685
Rym: Yep Except for old people.

138
00:07:48,705 --> 00:07:50,735
Scott: I don't know why people have such problems with battery life.

139
00:07:50,776 --> 00:07:53,400
Scott: fucking charge your phone I mean, I've never had my phone die out.

140
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:59,240
Scott: I've had to come close at conventions But I always make it to the hotel room with like 5% and then I plug it in and go to bed.

141
00:07:59,260 --> 00:07:59,601
Scott: I wake up.

142
00:07:59,621 --> 00:08:03,153
Rym: It's 100 or if I'm really like not sure I'm gonna make it.

143
00:08:03,514 --> 00:08:05,460
Rym: I do have in my bag that tiny battery.

144
00:08:05,962 --> 00:08:10,758
Scott: Yeah, I only have to use that at conventions where I wake up way early and get back to the room at like 2 a.m.

145
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,509
Scott: So that's how long my phone battery lasts.

146
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,655
Scott: How could you possibly run out your battery?

147
00:08:16,676 --> 00:08:18,200
Scott: What the hell are you watching movies on?

148
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,306
Scott: Are you watching Netflix?

149
00:08:19,326 --> 00:08:21,620
Scott: that are like all day while you're at this?

150
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,600
Scott: Apparently to watch a lot of Netflix to kill that battery.

151
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:30,940
Rym: So, uh as much as I would like to stay on Android there is literally no Android phone to buy at all.

152
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,049
Rym: Like they're all garbage.

153
00:08:32,068 --> 00:08:33,480
Rym: They're all giant pieces of garbage.

154
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:37,403
Scott: I hope you didn't spend a lot of money on Android apps cuz I spent a lot of my own iPhone app So I can't leave.

155
00:08:37,462 --> 00:08:38,006
Rym: I spent about.

156
00:08:38,086 --> 00:08:38,850
Rym: I'll lose all that.

157
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:42,597
Rym: I've spent about 40 bucks on Android apps so I'll probably lose about 40 bucks worth.

158
00:08:42,717 --> 00:08:51,480
Rym: but As much as I know I'm gonna bitch about Andrew our iPhones OS and interface for a while just because it'll be different is nothing to bitch about.

159
00:08:51,741 --> 00:08:53,949
Rym: Yeah, but I'm used to Android and I like Android.

160
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:55,775
Scott: but the Android ship sailed.

161
00:08:55,815 --> 00:08:57,140
Scott: there aren't any good Android phone.

162
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:01,540
Rym: So if a small iPhone comes out, like I'll just jump ship without even looking back.

163
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,223
Rym: I'll put up with.

164
00:09:02,504 --> 00:09:07,759
Rym: even if I hate the main complaint people have with iPhone They can't get rid of some of those icons.

165
00:09:08,082 --> 00:09:09,092
Scott: He's hide him in a folder.

166
00:09:09,112 --> 00:09:09,960
Scott: big fucking deal, right?

167
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,169
Scott: And then the other thing people come in.

168
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:12,460
Scott: I was like, how do you do this, right?

169
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,531
Scott: A lot of my co-workers like how do you do this?

170
00:09:14,591 --> 00:09:15,054
Scott: I just want to.

171
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:16,200
Scott: I just don't have files.

172
00:09:16,341 --> 00:09:18,188
Scott: It's like well dude my coworker today.

173
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:21,000
Rym: Oh, he like he uses a. he has an Android phone.

174
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,940
Rym: He's like, how do I get to the file Explorer on my phone?

175
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,367
Rym: I was like plug it into your computer.

176
00:09:25,387 --> 00:09:27,096
Rym: and he was like no, but I want it on the phone.

177
00:09:27,116 --> 00:09:29,433
Scott: and I was like Yeah, why it's like.

178
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:32,840
Scott: you just have to accept the fact that you're gonna do the same thing.

179
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:37,180
Scott: You can still do everything that you do by with your file Explorer finder, whatever.

180
00:09:37,582 --> 00:09:38,967
Scott: You just got to do it differently, right?

181
00:09:39,007 --> 00:09:42,160
Scott: For example, I got a movie and I want to watch it on my phone.

182
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,867
Scott: Right, so you could use iTunes.

183
00:09:43,948 --> 00:09:45,454
Scott: people hate iTunes for no reason.

184
00:09:45,474 --> 00:09:47,925
Scott: that I understand always works for me But everything works for me.

185
00:09:47,965 --> 00:09:50,355
Scott: Apparently, I don't like iTunes something.

186
00:09:50,415 --> 00:09:51,600
Rym: I have no use for I write.

187
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,920
Scott: But another thing you can do is you can get the VLC app for your iPhone or iPad.

188
00:09:56,322 --> 00:09:59,978
Scott: You can then access your video files in like 20 different ways.

189
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:05,779
Rym: Scott I realize that most people like even relatively young people never heard of VLC.

190
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,164
Scott: Okay, you can get the Amazon.

191
00:10:07,184 --> 00:10:08,688
Rym: look at all of our unnamed friends.

192
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:12,620
Rym: maybe icons who use like ghetto virus player, right?

193
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,283
Scott: And maybe it's.

194
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,840
Scott: maybe it's music you want to get on to there with your drag-and-drop.

195
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:22,647
Scott: well Just drag all your music into Amazon music player into the cloud and then install the Amazon music app and up Look, there's all your music.

196
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,580
Scott: same with the Amazon Kindle app, which is free.

197
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:31,806
Scott: Also, you can just drag PDFs and shit onto the internet in the cloud from your computer and then open up the app on Your phone and there they are.

198
00:10:32,128 --> 00:10:34,140
Scott: So you don't need any file Explorer nonsense.

199
00:10:34,523 --> 00:10:36,941
Rym: So anyway, I'm probably gonna jump ship if this comes out Like.

200
00:10:37,002 --> 00:10:39,700
Rym: I'm just gonna pre-order day one like immediately and never look back.

201
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:40,465
Scott: Oh cuz you're like.

202
00:10:40,485 --> 00:10:42,960
Scott: that's right cuz you're not on this two-year cycle that I'm on.

203
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:46,960
Scott: You're just like whatever there's a phone you can do because I I'm at the end of my cycle.

204
00:10:47,141 --> 00:10:49,560
Rym: I'm at the point of I would upgrade my Android phone.

205
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,300
Rym: I'm on and there is literally no phone in the world that is better enough.

206
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,003
Rym: They make such.

207
00:10:55,264 --> 00:10:59,600
Scott: I made such a good move by that iPhone 3g on day one waited in line for like a half hour.

208
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,640
Rym: Also, yeah, yeah, so I think Scott has some Apple iPhone news - well, this is news.

209
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:21,840
Scott: We've discussed this before because this is not the first time for this rumor But the rumors coming back so hard and strong this time that I feel like, you know It definitely has all the hallmarks of being even more true than the rumor you just had Yeah, which is that they're really gonna get rid of the headphone port on that iPhone and perhaps other I devices.

210
00:11:22,061 --> 00:11:31,732
Scott: I would be moderately annoyed because the TRS the TRS and then they're just gonna make you either a use bluetooth headphones or B which a lot of people already do.

211
00:11:31,752 --> 00:11:32,395
Scott: Yeah, right.

212
00:11:32,837 --> 00:11:38,680
Scott: or B Plug headphones that go into the lightning cable or get an adapter that goes from lightning to headphones.

213
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:49,548
Rym: So in my experience most bluetooth headphones, the sound quality is good But it's actually noticeably not as good as my like sure or etymotic TRS just regular.

214
00:11:49,568 --> 00:11:51,155
Scott: I had bluetooth headphones at work.

215
00:11:51,195 --> 00:11:51,737
Scott: I still have them.

216
00:11:51,757 --> 00:11:52,380
Scott: They were really good.

217
00:11:52,440 --> 00:12:09,331
Rym: The problem is they were cheap and the little head thing snapped and they won't stay on my ears Actually, so interestingly for the 5c or the 6c not the 5c 6c 7c the rumors Specifically show that they still have TRS.

218
00:12:09,733 --> 00:12:10,897
Rym: Okay, cuz they're not thin.

219
00:12:10,917 --> 00:12:14,520
Scott: Yeah The reason they're getting rid of is because it's like it's the thickest thing in there.

220
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:17,590
Rym: So get rid of the 5c that and the 5c that.

221
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:27,660
Scott: the headphone jack and the camera are pretty much the only things keeping them From making the phone like a lot smaller, but they can't make the phone that thin if they also make it small in the other dimensions.

222
00:12:28,102 --> 00:12:30,430
Rym: So the 6c has to be fatter.

223
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:33,120
Rym: so there's no benefit to getting rid of TR.

224
00:12:33,221 --> 00:12:35,660
Scott: This is why lightning is such a tiny thin connector, right?

225
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,647
Scott: It's anyway, but yeah I mean the thing is lightning.

226
00:12:38,707 --> 00:12:51,980
Scott: as far as I know and I could be wrong the old dock connector You're the big wide one that was on iPods Yeah But they used for like the early iPhones the 3g and whatnot That dock connector had a ton of pins on it and some of those pins had analog audio output.

227
00:12:52,341 --> 00:12:58,960
Scott: So you could actually get a really simple connector that would go into the dock connector and then headphones or cassette tape.

228
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,395
Scott: That's in your car or you know, all kinds of stuff.

229
00:13:01,415 --> 00:13:02,200
Scott: and I had this right?

230
00:13:02,502 --> 00:13:07,674
Scott: It was really simple cuz like the you know It had in there somewhere with some of those pins are for charging.

231
00:13:07,755 --> 00:13:08,940
Scott: some of them were for firewires.

232
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:12,169
Rym: I remember I had a device that I basically plug cuz.

233
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:20,979
Rym: I had my iPod nano and it had a TRS in the bottom Yeah, and I plugged a device into that that Re-broadcasted my audio over local FM.

234
00:13:21,161 --> 00:13:22,157
Scott: So I had one of those two.

235
00:13:22,682 --> 00:13:33,881
Scott: But anyway, the lightning connector as far as I know is a hundred percent digital Which means if you want to get a headphone adapter that goes into the lightning hole that that has to have a digital to analog converter Right.

236
00:13:34,283 --> 00:13:43,673
Scott: So the thing that you're gonna shove into the bottom of your iPhone to then put your headphones into is probably gonna Cost a lot of money if I know Apple 30 bucks or 50 bucks.

237
00:13:43,814 --> 00:13:46,250
Rym: Yeah, which we talked about this on the episode I'm not gonna get into.

238
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:53,017
Scott: like YTR They already have a connector that goes from that to HDMI and I have that connector and it's like 50 bucks.

239
00:13:53,197 --> 00:13:53,418
Rym: Yep.

240
00:13:54,100 --> 00:14:02,100
Rym: I suspect There's gonna be a lot of people complaining about this on the internet and freaking out but the reality is no one's gonna actually care.

241
00:14:02,662 --> 00:14:04,268
Rym: No who had who uses iPhones?

242
00:14:04,429 --> 00:14:07,180
Rym: No, no one's gonna not buy the next iPhone because of this.

243
00:14:09,244 --> 00:14:13,446
Scott: And I think someone someone is You know that really obstinate person.

244
00:14:13,466 --> 00:14:17,760
Rym: I don't know if that person yeah that person has never actually owned an iPhone.

245
00:14:18,761 --> 00:14:22,617
Rym: That person is running GNU Linux in their basement on their desktop there.

246
00:14:22,657 --> 00:14:23,300
Rym: No, they got Amiga.

247
00:14:24,121 --> 00:14:26,249
Scott: Mmm, I did the what the only it's not.

248
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:28,800
Scott: it's fine if we get rid of this old connector, right?

249
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,026
Scott: It's not the you know, we can.

250
00:14:30,086 --> 00:14:30,407
Scott: we have.

251
00:14:30,508 --> 00:14:31,412
Scott: Bluetooth is fine.

252
00:14:31,452 --> 00:14:33,200
Scott: It's also an open standard, right?

253
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,260
Scott: Lightning is sort of open ish, right?

254
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,926
Scott: even though no one else uses it but Apple.

255
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:45,508
Scott: but the problem is if you go to the store and Suddenly this, you know, you could buy any headphone in the store right now It would really suck if you went to the store.

256
00:14:45,589 --> 00:14:49,082
Scott: It's like no you got to buy the right Headphone.

257
00:14:49,123 --> 00:14:50,750
Scott: you can't just buy any headphone.

258
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,100
Scott: You got to buy the right one and you bought the wrong ones.

259
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:59,200
Scott: They don't work, you know, we need to make sure that every device in the whole earth You know from this point forward uses the same thing, right?

260
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,100
Rym: You don't have it because everything's gonna be you the USB right?

261
00:15:03,301 --> 00:15:09,608
Scott: It's now we've done this plenty of times right USB then newer USB except, you know There's gonna be piece from.

262
00:15:09,728 --> 00:15:13,365
Scott: you know, there's gonna be people who have our Side to HDMI.

263
00:15:13,385 --> 00:15:15,652
Scott: We didn't have a problem.

264
00:15:15,672 --> 00:15:18,420
Rym: A lot of people had problems along the way and we just let them perish.

265
00:15:18,803 --> 00:15:24,820
Scott: Yeah, it's not really the biggest deal As the other thing is we can't once we pick something right?

266
00:15:25,141 --> 00:15:27,779
Scott: We can't be changing it as frequently as we change USB.

267
00:15:28,101 --> 00:15:37,616
Scott: We got to be changing it like once in a blue moon because you don't want to be buying headphones and then suddenly I buy Lightning headphones and then five years from now apples like yeah, no more lightning.

268
00:15:37,656 --> 00:15:38,419
Scott: It's like fuck you.

269
00:15:38,881 --> 00:15:47,871
Rym: Well, I remember I had you know, my old iPod was like you can get iPods used to use firewire Mm-hmm, and then I had a firewire port and I would use it.

270
00:15:47,931 --> 00:15:51,608
Rym: and then I got a new iPod and it just didn't work With firewire anymore.

271
00:15:51,628 --> 00:15:53,419
Scott: Yeah that USB only yeah.

272
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:59,624
Rym: So I have an anecdote that's relevant to that in terms of people Misunderstanding those things.

273
00:16:00,066 --> 00:16:02,920
Rym: after we ran our freshman year in college at RIT.

274
00:16:03,382 --> 00:16:11,160
Rym: So this is like 2001. we all went back home and I was back at home You know in Michigan hanging out and a lot of my high school friends were around.

275
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:20,898
Rym: I went to a party and they wanted to watch a movie and then they say how Rym You should help us set up the home stereo theater, whatever.

276
00:16:20,978 --> 00:16:21,480
Scott: Oh, that's good.

277
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,539
Scott: They actually asked the person who knows best because a lot of times I go somewhere and it's like I see the TV.

278
00:16:25,741 --> 00:16:28,285
Scott: It's clearly not in HD Even though it's in the HDTV.

279
00:16:28,305 --> 00:16:34,348
Scott: I see that they're not using HDMI and it has nothing to do with me But they're like no one wants to hear my advice.

280
00:16:34,388 --> 00:16:35,994
Rym: You're going to computer school.

281
00:16:36,054 --> 00:16:37,560
Rym: So you know how to do this.

282
00:16:37,761 --> 00:16:38,645
Scott: You do know how to do it.

283
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:45,086
Rym: Yeah, so I go back behind their TV and what I see is RCA cables plugged into component.

284
00:16:46,028 --> 00:16:51,704
Rym: All right on the DVD player and plugged into the RCA inputs on The TV.

285
00:16:51,805 --> 00:16:59,906
Rym: so that wasn't working clearly but there was also and as video cable plugged into the DVD player and That was plugged into the TV.

286
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:03,820
Rym: and their complaint was that the HD whatever has always worked fine.

287
00:17:04,122 --> 00:17:07,280
Rym: But the sound never works unless video is video only.

288
00:17:07,942 --> 00:17:10,069
Scott: So as video is video only.

289
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:13,599
Rym: so the fact that you could plug the same cable into an RC.

290
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,799
Rym: You know RCA connectors were used for both component and the old RCA analog stuff.

291
00:17:18,423 --> 00:17:20,798
Rym: People just plug cables randomly into all that.

292
00:17:21,502 --> 00:17:24,919
Scott: That's a mistake of the design of component cables actually was that they were the same.

293
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:30,680
Rym: You know big stick in the middle ring around the edge cables, yeah, I feel like I should have made them a slightly different size.

294
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,189
Scott: You know modern cable design.

295
00:17:33,209 --> 00:17:36,360
Scott: they make sure that you know cables can only go in the right way.

296
00:17:36,782 --> 00:17:38,413
Scott: You know, you can't possibly put them into something.

297
00:17:38,434 --> 00:17:39,380
Scott: That's not where they belong.

298
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,062
Rym: Yeah, you can't.

299
00:17:40,123 --> 00:17:47,132
Rym: if they're directional they make them a shape so that they only go in in the early days of building computers Like you plug a cable in the wrong way.

300
00:17:47,272 --> 00:17:48,640
Rym: Everything's fried forever.

301
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,397
Scott: Yeah, now if you open up your computer, it's not possible to put something in the wrong spot.

302
00:17:52,457 --> 00:17:53,080
Scott: It just won't fit.

303
00:17:53,321 --> 00:17:56,760
Rym: Yep, I mean you'd be like a hard drive into the wrong half of a parallel cable.

304
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:01,882
Scott: It just wouldn't work and you wouldn't know why like I used to get IDE ribbon cables that didn't have that little notch in The middle.

305
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:06,845
Scott: Oh, and you'd have to know looking at the red stripe on the ribbon Which direction it went in.

306
00:18:06,925 --> 00:18:11,020
Rym: on the mother the red stripe we had to be closest to the power on the drive.

307
00:18:11,221 --> 00:18:14,780
Scott: I would look at the motherboard instruction manual to see the numbers on the pin out.

308
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,186
Scott: So I would put it towards the zero.

309
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,774
Rym: and but the worst one.

310
00:18:17,814 --> 00:18:19,180
Scott: now you have an SATA cable.

311
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:25,446
Scott: You can't fuck it up unless you can't even if you can fuck you fuck up an SATA cable putting it the wrong place Or the wrong whatever.

312
00:18:25,868 --> 00:18:27,035
Scott: you can't even build a Lego set.

313
00:18:27,055 --> 00:18:27,819
Scott: You're so dumb, right?

314
00:18:28,742 --> 00:18:30,109
Scott: Like a baby Lego like Duplo.

315
00:18:30,129 --> 00:18:31,697
Rym: So I got one last little news here.

316
00:18:31,817 --> 00:18:32,340
Rym: This is kind of fun.

317
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,113
Rym: I'm gonna read the anecdote from slash jock cuz.

318
00:18:34,134 --> 00:18:34,799
Rym: it's just kind of funny.

319
00:18:35,921 --> 00:18:42,459
Rym: An anonymous reader writes Nvidia GPUs don't clear out memory that was previously allocated and neither does Chrome.

320
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:57,060
Rym: When a user recently fired up Diablo 3 several hours after closing an incognito mode window that contained pornography The game launched with snapshots of that last private browsing session appearing on the screen.

321
00:18:57,981 --> 00:19:00,574
Rym: So what I'm gonna actually link to instead of the slash dot.

322
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:01,780
Rym: I like how they're very open.

323
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:06,720
Rym: They're like, yeah, I was looking at porn and then I saw my porn in Diablo when I launched it.

324
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,945
Scott: Well, this is really interesting.

325
00:19:07,985 --> 00:19:11,160
Scott: So what happens is when your computer is drawing to the screen, right?

326
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:16,940
Scott: There's a space in them in the video memory called the frame buffer and what it's doing is drawing literally your screen.

327
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:20,200
Scott: So let's say your screen is 800 by 600, which is a really old computer.

328
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:25,036
Scott: You've got basically like an array and each pixel on the screen is 32-bit color or 24-bit color.

329
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:32,255
Scott: So you have 24 bits times 800 times 600 that many bits in a space.

330
00:19:32,836 --> 00:19:34,480
Scott: and the computer has to draw the screen.

331
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,449
Scott: so what it does is it arranges those bits.

332
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:40,424
Scott: it says aha the top left pixel is Pure green.

333
00:19:40,665 --> 00:19:47,426
Scott: so in those, you know, 24 bits it puts zero zero FF zero zero All right, and there's your bits.

334
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:49,594
Scott: and then it says what's the next pixel?

335
00:19:49,634 --> 00:19:51,400
Scott: and it does this ridiculously fast.

336
00:19:51,501 --> 00:19:56,828
Scott: It does this so fast that it can draw all the pixels on the screen at 75 frames a second.

337
00:19:56,908 --> 00:19:59,080
Scott: usually you're 60 or whatever your frame rate is, right?

338
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,348
Scott: Yeah So is a space in the memory where it fills up.

339
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:06,300
Scott: it writes down in memory what color every pixel is and then the video.

340
00:20:06,665 --> 00:20:17,200
Scott: You know hardware Sends turns that space and memory into a signal that it sends to your monitor and the monitor takes that and draws the pixels On the screen and it keeps doing this over and over again.

341
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:34,057
Scott: Usually you'll do like double buffering or triple where you'll have like multiple buffers and it'll be drawing multiple screens at once Or it'll be just draw a screen and while that one's being displayed It starts drawing the next screen and then once it finishes drawing that screen and it starts being displayed It starts using the previous memory space and over and over.

342
00:20:34,077 --> 00:20:36,440
Rym: Yeah Now it's a good security practice.

343
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:45,922
Rym: Applications or operating systems should theoretically wipe out or make an accessible memory that has been released by Theoretically.

344
00:20:46,122 --> 00:20:58,700
Scott: if you could access someone's frame buffers or if the computer is storing up old frames and not using the same as X space in Memory, you could see what the person did on that computer going into the past regardless of what they were doing.

345
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:02,940
Scott: If you can access the video cards memory, you can access basically screenshots.

346
00:21:03,482 --> 00:21:07,232
Rym: So this guy so however far horn guy he was like, huh?

347
00:21:07,753 --> 00:21:10,040
Rym: I wonder if I can just get shit out of the frame buffer.

348
00:21:10,241 --> 00:21:11,325
Rym: This is a big security hole.

349
00:21:11,345 --> 00:21:13,495
Rym: Let me play around in the intro.

350
00:21:13,515 --> 00:21:14,600
Rym: I'm quoting him, right?

351
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:19,880
Scott: So here's the thing is that the chrome and most modern browsers does not clear memory for you.

352
00:21:20,181 --> 00:21:26,260
Scott: They're using the GPU to render right your browser, you know image, right?

353
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,740
Scott: So and your computer is generally using the GPU to render everything these days even 2d stuff.

354
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:36,080
Scott: So now the GPU is storing up all these things right with you know in its in its video ran.

355
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:40,535
Rym: So this guy wrote an application and you just across users just on the PC period.

356
00:21:40,595 --> 00:21:41,599
Rym: no security at all.

357
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:45,040
Rym: That would scan GPU memory because you can just read it all apparently.

358
00:21:45,123 --> 00:21:50,379
Scott: Yeah You know, I mean you can write a program and see that just tell sends commands to the GPU and it'll do so.

359
00:21:50,580 --> 00:22:01,626
Rym: We wrote a program that just look for non zero pixels Get grabbed everything it could get and then did some algorithms to rearrange because it would get like Corners and parts of images.

360
00:22:01,646 --> 00:22:03,934
Rym: and he recreated all these reddit pages.

361
00:22:03,974 --> 00:22:12,660
Rym: He'd been reading previously pixel perfect and Yeah, you can just totally spy on people many hours after they looked at their porn just by scanning.

362
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,888
Scott: The real question is there's a bug in Diablo.

363
00:22:14,968 --> 00:22:18,120
Scott: Why did Diablo upon and he's surrender some Diablo like crash.

364
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,036
Rym: He said it was just like Diablo freakishly crashed, you know video game.

365
00:22:21,418 --> 00:22:21,720
Scott: Oh, okay.

366
00:22:21,821 --> 00:22:22,427
Scott: So it wasn't.

367
00:22:22,528 --> 00:22:23,700
Scott: it wasn't like a bug in Diablo.

368
00:22:24,222 --> 00:22:28,560
Rym: He started Diablo cuz that'd be weird if it's normally was porn and then it crashed.

369
00:22:28,661 --> 00:22:31,860
Scott: Normally when a video game loads, you know, it says loading for a long time.

370
00:22:32,021 --> 00:22:44,469
Scott: Usually what it's doing is copying all of its textures from this the hard drive into the video memory And then when it starts rendering that allows the video card to quickly apply those textures To all the surfaces and whatever it is.

371
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:45,211
Scott: It needs to render.

372
00:22:45,352 --> 00:22:47,299
Rym: So if you can replace crash, right?

373
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,980
Rym: So if is he goes to join me calm, right?

374
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:58,100
Scott: So if a picture, you know If his porn site was in that Space and memory it would get applied to something like as if it was a texture and be rendered.

375
00:22:58,301 --> 00:22:59,126
Rym: Oh my god, he didn't.

376
00:22:59,227 --> 00:23:01,320
Rym: he censored out the image, but he didn't censor out.

377
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:06,314
Rym: So he was looking at redhead teen Mary McCray fingered in the hallway.

378
00:23:06,334 --> 00:23:07,617
Rym: All right, awesome.

379
00:23:07,698 --> 00:23:08,239
Scott: That sounds hot.

380
00:23:11,407 --> 00:23:24,019
Rym: So, yeah I guess if you look at things whatever they might be in your incognito windows and you share that computer with people or Anyone has malware cuz you know malware has probably been doing this for years.

381
00:23:24,782 --> 00:23:29,059
Scott: It probably hasn't but I think it might start now cuz someone who writes malware will see this.

382
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:34,426
Rym: Yeah at the same time if I was gonna write malware and I was trying to steal passwords Oh, they're not gonna steal password.

383
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:35,731
Scott: some screenshots cuz you can't see him.

384
00:23:35,871 --> 00:23:39,066
Rym: Yeah, but you could probably steal credit card numbers Mm-hmm.

385
00:23:39,411 --> 00:23:41,200
Rym: Yeah anyway.

386
00:23:46,701 --> 00:23:48,887
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

387
00:23:49,288 --> 00:23:49,849
Rym: this blog.

388
00:23:49,889 --> 00:23:56,733
Rym: I follow it because it's just about like war and peacekeeping and just sort of an interesting Look at that world from a hobbyist perspective.

389
00:23:56,894 --> 00:23:58,180
Scott: Haha obvious of war.

390
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:58,963
Rym: Yeah, it is.

391
00:23:59,024 --> 00:24:01,917
Rym: It's like if you're if you know about war and war nerds and stuff.

392
00:24:01,957 --> 00:24:05,089
Rym: It's just a cool blog But basically and it's got irrelevant.

393
00:24:05,109 --> 00:24:06,695
Scott: What we're not a good kind of nerd to be.

394
00:24:06,776 --> 00:24:12,340
Rym: we did an episode in 2007 Scott that we just called weapons needed ideas.

395
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,223
Scott: We still need ideas.

396
00:24:13,223 --> 00:24:18,618
Rym: 2007 running out of ideas sentiment and this is an article about a gentleman who?

397
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,746
Rym: Basically worked for the.

398
00:24:20,766 --> 00:24:24,546
Rym: he had a. he had a gun shop in Manhattan But it didn't sell.

399
00:24:24,626 --> 00:24:24,888
Rym: good.

400
00:24:24,908 --> 00:24:25,932
Scott: You could still have a gun shop.

401
00:24:25,953 --> 00:24:27,460
Rym: I know it didn't sell guns.

402
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:31,052
Rym: It sold custom holsters for concealed guns to hide them.

403
00:24:31,734 --> 00:24:33,904
Scott: I guess that's like all the bong shops We have.

404
00:24:33,965 --> 00:24:34,570
Scott: you can't sell.

405
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:35,679
Scott: we be you can sell bones.

406
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:44,372
Rym: But actually that was a front for the CIA and the FBI and in the back of the office He just fucking made crazy one-off custom guns for spies.

407
00:24:44,432 --> 00:24:48,590
Scott: I'm sure you could tell by going to a shop like that I mean the stuff the place that sells bongs.

408
00:24:48,931 --> 00:24:49,715
Scott: you can get weed there.

409
00:24:49,816 --> 00:24:51,845
Scott: Yeah Everybody knows.

410
00:24:51,985 --> 00:24:54,274
Scott: I actually don't know the place that sells gun holsters.

411
00:24:54,595 --> 00:24:55,700
Scott: You can get guns there.

412
00:24:56,001 --> 00:24:59,700
Rym: I don't know if I could get weed at the place downstairs because you see you know that bodega by us.

413
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:03,616
Rym: They the whole front of the building is nothing but bongs.

414
00:25:03,777 --> 00:25:04,540
Scott: I'm sure you can get weed.

415
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:12,937
Rym: I don't know if I walk in there like hey, you can at least get weirdo tobacco to put in a hooker Yeah, but I don't know if I went to them and I was like, hey, can I buy weed from you?

416
00:25:13,057 --> 00:25:14,985
Rym: if they'd be like Yes, how many weeds would?

417
00:25:15,045 --> 00:25:19,159
Scott: well you they might discriminate against you being a white dude thinking you're a cop, right?

418
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,507
Scott: I might be the only reason they say no.

419
00:25:21,829 --> 00:25:24,300
Rym: Yeah, but I'm also kind of a nerd hipster, dude.

420
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,533
Rym: So maybe that I mean no cop looks like me.

421
00:25:26,553 --> 00:25:27,097
Rym: Mm-hmm.

422
00:25:28,048 --> 00:25:31,550
Rym: So, uh, yeah They talk about because a lot of this got declassified.

423
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:41,080
Rym: now the kinds of crazy weapons this dude made Because all this stuff was very recently declassified and a lot of what he did apparently is still classified.

424
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:46,120
Rym: But I think my favorite one and they made a lot of these is a 12 shot clipboard.

425
00:25:47,127 --> 00:25:57,049
Rym: so Specifically for someone who's negotiating with a terrorist hostage taker to sit down with them to go over their demands and then Kill everyone in the room.

426
00:25:57,069 --> 00:25:59,639
Rym: I Guess except the hostages.

427
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,205
Rym: Okay, I learned about.

428
00:26:02,927 --> 00:26:03,730
Rym: so check this out.

429
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:06,880
Rym: This is a sight, you know guns have different kinds of sights apparently spies.

430
00:26:06,961 --> 00:26:09,740
Rym: We're like we generally don't shoot people far away.

431
00:26:10,181 --> 00:26:16,260
Rym: We need pistols that are good for like killing people in the room with us like pretty close range.

432
00:26:16,621 --> 00:26:27,560
Rym: So they have this custom kind of sight that's designed for like quick hip shots Like whip a gun out and shoot someone like gangsters doing old movies and the whole gun is covered in teflon.

433
00:26:27,941 --> 00:26:31,034
Rym: So you can draw it quickly and without a drop.

434
00:26:31,396 --> 00:26:37,637
Scott: drop it quickly Yeah, well snag on anything just fall on the ground because you can't hold on to it might as well cover it in Greece.

435
00:26:38,199 --> 00:26:41,033
Rym: woman Have you got any race?

436
00:26:41,356 --> 00:26:47,667
Scott: Yes Okay, so I kick-started something a while ago Because it was nine dollars.

437
00:26:47,687 --> 00:26:48,973
Scott: It was one of those tiny computers.

438
00:26:49,014 --> 00:26:49,074
Scott: Now.

439
00:26:49,094 --> 00:26:50,320
Scott: We got plenty of tiny computers.

440
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,308
Scott: You got the Arduinos of the world.

441
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:53,552
Scott: There's a Microsoft one.

442
00:26:53,572 --> 00:26:55,580
Scott: This is Texas Instruments one, right?

443
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,300
Scott: There's the Raspberry Pi which is mad popular these days.

444
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:02,260
Rym: It's the kind of things that ideally reason I don't kick-start all these things that I never have a good reason to use them.

445
00:27:02,361 --> 00:27:03,470
Scott: I don't have a good reason to use it either.

446
00:27:03,531 --> 00:27:04,560
Scott: but this one is nine bucks.

447
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,808
Scott: So I'm like whatever who gives a shit right nine bucks.

448
00:27:06,828 --> 00:27:07,752
Scott: I get a tiny computer.

449
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,980
Scott: I don't care, you know, it might be useful.

450
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:10,829
Scott: It's really tiny.

451
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:11,860
Scott: It's only nine dollars.

452
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:16,060
Scott: I won't miss the nine dollars if this computer sits in my you know with my Arduinos and whatnot.

453
00:27:16,621 --> 00:27:17,727
Scott: No biggie what.

454
00:27:17,767 --> 00:27:18,591
Scott: and I forgot about it.

455
00:27:18,631 --> 00:27:19,575
Scott: cuz well, you know, I kick.

456
00:27:19,595 --> 00:27:23,178
Scott: sometimes you kick-start something You just don't forget remember it and then one day it shows up.

457
00:27:24,002 --> 00:27:31,567
Scott: so I opened it and this is the chip computer C dot H dot I dot P and I checked it out cuz I had it now for nine bucks.

458
00:27:32,389 --> 00:27:34,375
Scott: And then I realized what the hell it was.

459
00:27:35,177 --> 00:27:37,159
Scott: and oh my god Let me tell you a story.

460
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:41,964
Scott: So I used to work in college at this place and I was programming for you know This board.

461
00:27:41,984 --> 00:27:51,274
Scott: it was a single board computer with an Intel x scale CPU And it had like 16 megabytes of storage or something like.

462
00:27:51,615 --> 00:27:52,960
Scott: it was really really weak.

463
00:27:53,623 --> 00:27:54,527
Scott: It was kind of big cuz.

464
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:57,180
Scott: he had a lot of serial ports and input outputs and things like that.

465
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:01,560
Scott: But it was really really weak and tiny and didn't have much storage at all.

466
00:28:02,142 --> 00:28:05,177
Scott: And I had to program for this thing and one of them cost like 500 bucks.

467
00:28:06,881 --> 00:28:08,406
Scott: This thing cost nine dollars.

468
00:28:08,466 --> 00:28:09,228
Scott: It's really tiny.

469
00:28:09,649 --> 00:28:12,960
Scott: the bottom of it has a plastic thing so you can just rest it on your desk.

470
00:28:13,081 --> 00:28:15,579
Scott: No problem, it gets power from micro USB.

471
00:28:15,821 --> 00:28:19,120
Scott: It has one actual USB port for plugging in a mouse keyboard whatevs.

472
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:22,454
Scott: It has a TRS connector, but is?

473
00:28:22,655 --> 00:28:31,280
Scott: the TR is audio But then the second R is video so you can plug it into the RCA on a TV or whatever to see what you know.

474
00:28:31,422 --> 00:28:37,339
Scott: the display It has a whole bunch of pins on the top just like an Arduino does for you know.

475
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:42,368
Scott: Controlling electronic devices or an LED readout or analog inputs and all that kind of stuff.

476
00:28:42,449 --> 00:28:43,010
Scott: power you know.

477
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:49,620
Scott: But the specs on this thing for nine dollars for this ridiculously tiny computer.

478
00:28:50,182 --> 00:28:56,200
Scott: The CPU is a 1 gigahertz CPU which is guess that can get stuff done as long as it's not games.

479
00:28:56,602 --> 00:29:08,279
Scott: Yeah, I mean my CPU is only 2.6 ish 512 megabytes of RAM a Four gigabyte SSD just like built into this little book.

480
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,826
Scott: yeah, and it has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.

481
00:29:10,866 --> 00:29:11,709
Scott: the Wi-Fi is GN.

482
00:29:12,952 --> 00:29:14,036
Scott: The Bluetooth is 4.0.

483
00:29:14,036 --> 00:29:18,169
Scott: You can use it and it runs Debbie, and it's already runs Debbie and as soon as you get it.

484
00:29:19,272 --> 00:29:20,094
Scott: That's ridiculous.

485
00:29:20,315 --> 00:29:24,106
Scott: You can do it like more than the Raspberry Pi like Raspberry Pi is junk.

486
00:29:24,166 --> 00:29:25,570
Scott: now basically because this exists.

487
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:28,570
Rym: You know what I would use those for if I had my druthers.

488
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:30,918
Rym: You could get let's see a gig of RAM $18 so $20 per gigabyte of RAM.

489
00:29:35,731 --> 00:29:37,316
Scott: Right this thing is ridiculous.

490
00:29:37,917 --> 00:29:42,050
Scott: I mean you could basically take a monitor and strap this to the back and boom you're done.

491
00:29:42,112 --> 00:29:45,614
Rym: Yeah I would say you know conventions like ConnectiCon or whatever.

492
00:29:45,814 --> 00:29:50,472
Rym: if we could get a bunch of TVs to stick like by panel ops just stick one of those things on The TV.

493
00:29:50,532 --> 00:29:50,653
Rym: do.

494
00:29:50,673 --> 00:29:54,930
Scott: this thing can run pretty much any emulator NES SNES, right?

495
00:29:55,331 --> 00:29:55,592
Scott: It can.

496
00:29:55,672 --> 00:29:57,498
Scott: you can run like all sorts of Linux.

497
00:29:57,518 --> 00:29:58,741
Scott: you can run Chrome on here.

498
00:29:59,002 --> 00:30:00,868
Scott: you could run audacity on here.

499
00:30:00,928 --> 00:30:01,449
Scott: you could run.

500
00:30:02,773 --> 00:30:12,390
Scott: You know the GIMP emails VLC Pretty much anything that runs on Linux will run on this thing and run a surprising number of games in that actually.

501
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:16,350
Scott: Yeah, I mean if you want it to be super portable you need to find a battery for it.

502
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,321
Scott: You know how much power does it draw.

503
00:30:18,341 --> 00:30:19,810
Rym: I mean I could probably power for a while.

504
00:30:20,272 --> 00:30:27,076
Scott: I mean if you get a giant battery that has micro USB output which every battery does Got that like 26,000.

505
00:30:27,076 --> 00:30:30,106
Scott: Whatever milliamp hour battery like you're freaking good to go.

506
00:30:30,126 --> 00:30:31,229
Scott: like this thing is redonk.

507
00:30:31,851 --> 00:30:36,990
Scott: If you have any sort of project that needs any sort of you know CPU off to the side.

508
00:30:38,293 --> 00:30:46,536
Scott: I think Arduino and also Raspberry Pi pretty much have to eat it because the chip is here In the meta moment.

509
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:49,050
Rym: the book club book was a long time ago the wheel of time.

510
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:55,318
Rym: I bring this up because I'm moving on to book 8 and what I can say is that my Favorite thing about the wheel of time.

511
00:30:55,338 --> 00:30:57,830
Rym: or you know the ale like those guys yeah at them.

512
00:30:59,212 --> 00:31:02,710
Rym: So there's a bunch of ale wannabe weeaboos that come up later.

513
00:31:03,131 --> 00:31:08,026
Rym: So there are people who aren't ale people in like tier and all these places like whoa like the young nobles.

514
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:10,134
Rym: those ale are Super cool.

515
00:31:10,214 --> 00:31:11,179
Scott: They just want to be like that.

516
00:31:11,199 --> 00:31:17,603
Rym: They start acting like them wearing each other guys Shan or we start wearing ideal clothes Yeah, and half the ale like ideal food.

517
00:31:17,724 --> 00:31:27,807
Rym: half of the ale are like wow We these we gotta keep spread the word of how to act like civilized human beings Because they're finally getting it and the other half are like what the fuck are these kids doing?

518
00:31:27,827 --> 00:31:28,509
Rym: can we just kill them?

519
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:31,678
Scott: Seriously guys dat cultural appropriation.

520
00:31:31,738 --> 00:31:35,270
Rym: I just go kill them, but there's a scene where one dude remarks like Iran.

521
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:45,355
Rym: Can I just go murder all those kids because they're really not offensive just personally annoying to me That appropriation.

522
00:31:45,456 --> 00:31:46,682
Rym: we are going to be at Pac South.

523
00:31:46,802 --> 00:31:48,350
Rym: our schedule is slightly updated.

524
00:31:49,113 --> 00:31:59,610
Rym: As a favor we let them move Atari game design to the earlier slot because someone Needed that panel slot because they have to video a packs like penny arcade panel, and we don't really give a crap.

525
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,396
Rym: Yeah, so they email me.

526
00:32:01,436 --> 00:32:05,590
Rym: They're like yeah, you guys have done like every like a billion packs panels.

527
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:06,454
Rym: You okay with this?

528
00:32:06,654 --> 00:32:06,815
Scott: like?

529
00:32:06,855 --> 00:32:07,337
Scott: I don't care.

530
00:32:07,538 --> 00:32:09,888
Rym: Yeah, like maybe if they'd put it at like 8 a.m.

531
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:12,837
Rym: On Friday, I'd be like no, but I don't care.

532
00:32:13,018 --> 00:32:13,840
Scott: do whatever you want.

533
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:15,165
Rym: Atari game design.

534
00:32:15,325 --> 00:32:19,320
Rym: Saturday at 1130 a.m Scared yet a discussion of horror and games.

535
00:32:19,421 --> 00:32:26,750
Rym: Saturday at 5 30 p.m Sunday January 31st at 1 p.m Designing game rules.

536
00:32:27,273 --> 00:32:30,650
Scott: Also packs is now having a night runner tournament Pac South.

537
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:35,150
Scott: Oh, yeah, Sunday morning at 11 so I can play a little bit and then go to a panel.

538
00:32:35,391 --> 00:32:39,710
Rym: Yeah, and then I get a fly immediately to Boston from San Antonio.

539
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:41,437
Rym: That has no direct flights anywhere.

540
00:32:41,518 --> 00:32:44,330
Scott: as far as I can tell no one wants to fly directly to Santa.

541
00:32:44,611 --> 00:32:48,385
Rym: No one wants to fly directly to New York from San Antonio like no one except us.

542
00:32:48,605 --> 00:32:49,870
Scott: That's right is really interesting.

543
00:32:50,131 --> 00:33:02,350
Rym: Yeah, like I expected to not get a direct flight to Boston from somewhere like San Antonio But can't even get one from New York Really, you should be able to get a flight from New York to anywhere on planet earth that has an airport directly, right?

544
00:33:03,451 --> 00:33:13,850
Scott: Yeah, I mean there might be those flights that are like once a week, you know If you want to go to a certain country, there's not a flight every day Scott when I flew to Turkey, there's multiple flights every day to Istanbul.

545
00:33:14,051 --> 00:33:19,201
Scott: No, but I'm saying like if you want to fly to say Luxembourg direct is there really a flight every day.

546
00:33:19,221 --> 00:33:20,245
Rym: I think there's at least one every day.

547
00:33:20,265 --> 00:33:21,530
Scott: There might be one a day, right?

548
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:31,377
Rym: It's not like you could go at the time you want, you know Let me put it this way New York spoils you so bad on flights and you want if you wanna die from London To somewhere else even London.

549
00:33:31,457 --> 00:33:35,850
Rym: It's like oh, there's only like one flight to Paris left today.

550
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:39,903
Scott: You want to go to Buenos Aires, is there really a flight every day?

551
00:33:39,983 --> 00:33:45,589
Scott: maybe one a day at most maybe one every other You know, yeah, it's like how many people are going to Argentina from?

552
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:48,046
Scott: right, New York every day.

553
00:33:49,073 --> 00:33:51,281
Rym: But uh PAX East coming up.

554
00:33:51,341 --> 00:33:52,565
Rym: we put our panels in for that.

555
00:33:52,706 --> 00:33:53,710
Rym: So stay tuned.

556
00:33:55,058 --> 00:33:55,569
Rym: What else we got?

557
00:33:56,732 --> 00:33:57,755
Rym: We put in our panels.

558
00:33:57,875 --> 00:34:00,483
Scott: magfest is coming before any of those magfest.

559
00:34:00,864 --> 00:34:03,130
Rym: We got like seven fucking panels.

560
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:04,094
Rym: It's gonna be awesome.

561
00:34:04,235 --> 00:34:11,829
Rym: But also magfest is four days long Oh my god, and it's too early to even book our travel for that, but we'll be there.

562
00:34:13,393 --> 00:34:29,050
Rym: Also the patreon edging toward that first stretch goal surprisingly, so if we get not that many more patrons if Even a quarter of the people listening to these words right now gave us just one dollar Just one dollar you don't even have to commit to giving it to us forever.

563
00:34:30,112 --> 00:34:32,178
Scott: Everyone listening probably did give you $1.

564
00:34:32,178 --> 00:34:36,750
Scott: the people who you think are listening just downloaded without listening is no automatic podcast download.

565
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:40,385
Rym: We only have like 50 something patrons, but they're giving us like 250 bucks a month.

566
00:34:41,831 --> 00:34:44,501
Scott: What the hell is wrong with you people stop giving her money.

567
00:34:44,661 --> 00:34:46,790
Rym: all of you just gave us a dollar not pay.

568
00:34:46,931 --> 00:34:47,917
Scott: It'd be better for you.

569
00:34:47,937 --> 00:34:49,164
Scott: No, do not.

570
00:34:49,406 --> 00:34:50,813
Scott: zero dollars You should give.

571
00:34:50,833 --> 00:34:53,630
Rym: but guys you can hack patreon you almost dead.

572
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:59,006
Scott: Vast majority of people listening to this have less money than me or Rym for now.

573
00:34:59,086 --> 00:35:03,199
Scott: Do not give us money Unless you have more money than both of us.

574
00:35:03,259 --> 00:35:05,910
Scott: in which case give us money until we are even with you.

575
00:35:06,111 --> 00:35:07,539
Rym: Well guys, there is a stretch goal.

576
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:12,690
Rym: if you can muster up 24 grand a month We will we're not lying quit our jobs and do this full-time.

577
00:35:12,951 --> 00:35:15,178
Scott: Well, I'll do whatever you want me to do.

578
00:35:15,398 --> 00:35:16,421
Scott: new employer person.

579
00:35:16,442 --> 00:35:18,869
Rym: I'll also eat my hat and probably pass out.

580
00:35:20,671 --> 00:35:28,808
Scott: Do not also if you are going to throw money away on The Powerball lottery give it to us instead.

581
00:35:28,908 --> 00:35:33,145
Scott: Yes Do not think that you're taking money and you're setting it on fire.

582
00:35:33,486 --> 00:35:35,333
Scott: if you give it to Rym You're not setting on a fire.

583
00:35:35,353 --> 00:35:38,625
Scott: You're only putting in the toilet, which is less bad than setting it on fire.

584
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:44,430
Rym: But also, uh We you could give a dollar and then we'd hit the stretch goal.

585
00:35:44,773 --> 00:35:46,429
Rym: So we'd have to release all the episodes.

586
00:35:46,831 --> 00:35:53,628
Rym: You could just take the not give any more dollars just cancel it after the first month because the stretch goal is just the peak The high-water mark.

587
00:35:53,991 --> 00:35:58,550
Scott: So if you guys what if it hits the goal for like one second and then goes under then well at least for one month.

588
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:00,859
Rym: If it hits it for one month, then I'm obligated.

589
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:01,963
Rym: I got a re-release.

590
00:36:01,983 --> 00:36:02,987
Scott: the money has to come in.

591
00:36:03,068 --> 00:36:04,653
Scott: Yeah once Once.

592
00:36:04,834 --> 00:36:11,209
Scott: so someone just changes their there, you know They're giving it's like a thousand and then immediately five minutes later brings it down to zero.

593
00:36:11,229 --> 00:36:12,378
Rym: now I'm not gonna do it back.

594
00:36:12,398 --> 00:36:13,749
Scott: So you actually have to get the cash.

595
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:20,108
Rym: Yeah, but if we get the cash even once then we which means me give your money to a real charity instead.

596
00:36:20,148 --> 00:36:21,553
Scott: some suggestions We'll see.

597
00:36:21,573 --> 00:36:22,779
Rym: syringas patreon.

598
00:36:22,799 --> 00:36:23,703
Rym: You should give the money to.

599
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:25,050
Scott: yeah, he needs money's more than we do.

600
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,194
Rym: He makes more swell.

601
00:36:26,696 --> 00:36:27,338
Rym: We've made more.

602
00:36:27,398 --> 00:36:29,085
Scott: He's also more talented than we are.

603
00:36:29,105 --> 00:36:30,530
Rym: We've made more hours of content.

604
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:36,970
Scott: He's one minute of quality of content one minute of neil Cesar Ega content is worth more than all the GeekNights ever times a thousand.

605
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:39,281
Rym: So he's not getting that much more money than us on patreon.

606
00:36:39,321 --> 00:36:40,105
Rym: He really deserves it.

607
00:36:40,346 --> 00:36:41,230
Scott: Oh, I should give him some money.

608
00:36:41,271 --> 00:36:41,928
Scott: I'm giving him money.

609
00:36:42,652 --> 00:36:47,962
Scott: The Here are the suggested charities official charities of GeekNights already.

610
00:36:48,223 --> 00:36:49,747
Scott: comic book legal defense fund.

611
00:36:49,827 --> 00:36:55,450
Scott: Yeah Or said EFF, except I don't agree with them on privacy, but everything else is fine.

612
00:36:56,694 --> 00:36:58,620
Scott: The Creative Commons is a good one.

613
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,045
Scott: All right, the ACLU is good.

614
00:37:00,265 --> 00:37:01,289
Scott: ACLU is okay.

615
00:37:01,309 --> 00:37:04,762
Rym: Yeah Well, they're good because at least they're pretty ideologically consistent.

616
00:37:04,782 --> 00:37:06,528
Scott: Yeah, doctors that borders always good.

617
00:37:06,709 --> 00:37:09,182
Rym: Yeah You know what Planned Parenthood.

618
00:37:09,363 --> 00:37:10,328
Rym: they could actually use the money.

619
00:37:10,368 --> 00:37:12,499
Scott: right now They just take donations straight up.

620
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,630
Rym: I'm pretty sure you can donate directly to Planned Parenthood.

621
00:37:14,731 --> 00:37:15,876
Scott: Oh, I did not know that.

622
00:37:15,937 --> 00:37:19,136
Scott: I thought it was not a. if you never thought of it as a charity That would be like.

623
00:37:19,458 --> 00:37:23,561
Scott: well, it shouldn't be a charity Sure, but I didn't realize that it was like you could do that.

624
00:37:23,682 --> 00:37:24,445
Rym: It needs money.

625
00:37:24,786 --> 00:37:25,027
Scott: Sure.

626
00:37:25,047 --> 00:37:25,369
Rym: Why not?

627
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:27,713
Scott: What are the other nerdy ones though?

628
00:37:27,834 --> 00:37:28,676
Scott: archive org?

629
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:31,082
Scott: Yeah, the Wikimedia Foundation.

630
00:37:31,102 --> 00:37:37,767
Rym: Yeah trying to think of nerdy ones, you know, uh There's a few other patrons of people we know you could give money to.

631
00:37:37,827 --> 00:37:38,330
Rym: they make art.

632
00:37:38,712 --> 00:37:43,054
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I'm sure there might be one I'm missing or whatever cuz I didn't think of this until just now I'll crash course.

633
00:37:43,074 --> 00:37:45,365
Rym: you give money to any patreon give it to crash course.

634
00:37:45,425 --> 00:37:46,270
Scott: Yeah, you don't need that.

635
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:48,819
Rym: They are the some of the that's some of the that one.

636
00:37:48,859 --> 00:37:50,785
Rym: They're the reason can a patreon exists?

637
00:37:51,588 --> 00:38:00,670
Rym: and two That's probably one of the more noble causes because they actually just create educational stuff for free forever Independent of if you give them money kind of like gig nights.

638
00:38:01,351 --> 00:38:04,429
Rym: We'll keep doing gig nights even if you give no money to the patreon ever.

639
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:08,760
Rym: So, yeah, Oh child's play child's play there you go.

640
00:38:09,021 --> 00:38:13,255
Rym: or uh, you know games done quick because they just turn the lights That's the see.

641
00:38:13,275 --> 00:38:14,721
Scott: I'm not sure about the games done quick.

642
00:38:14,741 --> 00:38:16,670
Rym: They turn that money right around in a cancer chair.

643
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:21,310
Scott: Well, they give it to the prevent cancer Foundation, which I'm not sure is about cancer prevention.

644
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:25,327
Scott: Yeah, and it's like awareness and those charities are usually is awareness.

645
00:38:25,427 --> 00:38:28,982
Scott: It's not research I mean, I don't know but it's about preventing cancer.

646
00:38:29,002 --> 00:38:30,670
Scott: They might do research to prevent cancer.

647
00:38:31,211 --> 00:38:35,884
Rym: It's always tough for those cancer charities because we're gonna talk about a dour topic.

648
00:38:35,924 --> 00:38:38,330
Scott: my summer games done quick does.

649
00:38:39,291 --> 00:38:40,595
Rym: There was a big meta study.

650
00:38:40,656 --> 00:38:42,883
Rym: I didn't read the fullness of it yet, but it's it's.

651
00:38:43,384 --> 00:38:43,946
Rym: it's one of those.

652
00:38:44,026 --> 00:38:46,765
Scott: like that sucks They take all the studies and combine them.

653
00:38:46,967 --> 00:38:59,902
Rym: Yeah Yeah The study basically said that the death rate like n years out from cancer has not decreased at all In 30-ish years despite prevention despite screening.

654
00:39:00,223 --> 00:39:06,730
Rym: and it basically said that screening for cancer and Detecting it early has no outcome on the actual death rate across the population.

655
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:07,693
Scott: Mm-hmm

656
00:39:07,893 --> 00:39:27,018
Rym: that basically people who had like the few people who could be saved because they have the rare cancer That's actually that treatable and they catch it that early is mitigated by the people who get pre-screened and they aggressively treated cancer That either would have been deadly anyway, or wouldn't have been deadly But the treatment ended up being worse.

657
00:39:27,138 --> 00:39:29,044
Scott: how often is treatment end up being worse?

658
00:39:29,084 --> 00:39:31,050
Scott: you think that the oncologist editor should be able to?

659
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:35,670
Rym: Well, what it comes down to is a lot of cancers aren't actually treatable in any meaningful way, right?

660
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:37,578
Scott: So you just tell the person this isn't treatable.

661
00:39:37,658 --> 00:39:45,169
Rym: deal with it, but the study's main point was that Vastly increased cancer screening has had zero impact on cancer deaths.

662
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:55,190
Rym: hmm, and then the rest of it which I haven't finished reading talks a lot about the ramifications of that and Follow-up studies to determine, you know, why the answer is currently still zero.

663
00:39:56,713 --> 00:40:01,430
Scott: What if you have the rare preventable one and you don't get screening because it doesn't affect the statistics?

664
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:07,650
Rym: Apparently apparently all these people getting colonoscopies earlier has not significantly impacted the death rate of colon cancer.

665
00:40:07,951 --> 00:40:13,996
Rym: Well, because if you get it, you're gonna die, you know, yeah, but what they're saying is that pre-screening It has not reduced the death rate.

666
00:40:14,157 --> 00:40:16,386
Scott: Well, cuz it's not one of those rare preventable ones.

667
00:40:16,848 --> 00:40:20,017
Rym: Yeah Theoretically can magically lips that would.

668
00:40:20,058 --> 00:40:23,070
Rym: then you know, I mean, I'm gonna get my colonoscopy is when I'm 40.

669
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:27,350
Scott: So does that mean cleaning, you know getting your polyp scraped out doesn't help you live longer.

670
00:40:28,034 --> 00:40:35,795
Scott: All the questions you're asking I have not finished reading it yet Are you saying my just death rate cuz it could be like, okay, you still gonna do everyone the death rates a hundred percent Right.

671
00:40:35,835 --> 00:40:37,710
Scott: I gotta live ten years longer and then I died.

672
00:40:38,312 --> 00:40:40,638
Rym: I read there's another article to talk about.

673
00:40:40,678 --> 00:40:49,527
Rym: statistically the death rates not a hundred percent because so many people are alive today That there's a place like a ninety nine point nine nine eight percent chance that you'll actually die.

674
00:40:49,727 --> 00:40:50,470
Rym: based on the evidence.

675
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:51,479
Rym: We have two dates.

676
00:40:51,842 --> 00:40:52,286
Scott: Yeah, okay.

677
00:40:52,487 --> 00:40:53,610
Scott: Yeah anyway.

678
00:40:55,171 --> 00:41:00,813
Rym: So to get onto a much the one of the few things we could talk about that's worse than cancer Nuclear weapon.

679
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:04,790
Rym: This is rims favorite topic for some reason just lately because it's been in the news a lot.

680
00:41:04,851 --> 00:41:06,647
Rym: So what's been bothering me?

681
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:10,117
Scott: Chomsky Rym over here Rym Chomsky.

682
00:41:10,177 --> 00:41:11,742
Rym: No, I'm sure he's one of my favorite people.

683
00:41:11,782 --> 00:41:14,550
Rym: Okay, so they're gonna nuke us all.

684
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:26,730
Rym: Basically, I know a lot about nukes partly because I had some high school teachers who like when we like when we learned about World War two I had a high school teacher like that, you know, like the sophomore year like well kids modern history coming

685
00:41:27,531 --> 00:41:27,813
Scott: He

686
00:41:27,914 --> 00:41:30,150
Rym: we spent like a month talking about nuclear weapons.

687
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:33,566
Rym: The dude just knew a lot about him and was real mad about him.

688
00:41:33,928 --> 00:41:36,235
Rym: and fun fact He actually was a big gnome Chomsky fan.

689
00:41:36,255 --> 00:41:38,983
Rym: Okay, and also a Lenin fan.

690
00:41:39,124 --> 00:41:40,347
Rym: So your mileage may vary.

691
00:41:40,688 --> 00:41:51,189
Rym: Okay, and so recently North Korea, you know Detonated a nuclear test which is problematic for a lot of reasons I mean when I don't want to talk about politics at all.

692
00:41:51,671 --> 00:41:57,448
Rym: But the headline that CNN ran was North Korea detonates hydrogen bomb.

693
00:41:57,628 --> 00:42:05,585
Rym: unlikely Definitely didn't happen and I realized already that most of the people I talked to.

694
00:42:05,665 --> 00:42:07,590
Scott: if they did I'm gonna buy a lottery ticket.

695
00:42:08,363 --> 00:42:19,050
Rym: Yeah Very few nations in history have ever developed or detonated a quote hydrogen bomb Which is misnomer calling it a hydrogen bomb and it's nothing to do with hydrogen.

696
00:42:19,292 --> 00:42:21,830
Rym: Yeah, like it's kind of like a bomb H of all that nonsense.

697
00:42:21,991 --> 00:42:22,675
Scott: I mean people.

698
00:42:23,279 --> 00:42:25,070
Scott: they don't really teach you this in school, right?

699
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:31,581
Scott: They teach you about like Japan and dropping, you know, the little boy the fat man What at right and you know, you think atomic bomb.

700
00:42:32,184 --> 00:42:33,770
Scott: and then you know about ICBMs.

701
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:34,690
Scott: It's like a big rocket.

702
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:43,224
Scott: They can go to the other side of the world and but people don't realize that the warhead they put on the ICBM is Not like the atomic bomb.

703
00:42:43,284 --> 00:42:43,787
Rym: It was in Japan.

704
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:49,390
Rym: It's a completely different thing and in fact people talk about India and Pakistan being nuclear states.

705
00:42:50,092 --> 00:42:52,739
Rym: They have a gun type wet.

706
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:53,260
Scott: They have.

707
00:42:53,441 --> 00:42:55,506
Scott: they have the things that we dropped on Japan.

708
00:42:55,546 --> 00:43:03,810
Rym: They have the thing that we dropped on Hiroshima at best right modified slightly to be a little more powerful.

709
00:43:04,092 --> 00:43:06,448
Scott: We still have some of those because they're still useful.

710
00:43:06,569 --> 00:43:06,670
Scott: like.

711
00:43:07,674 --> 00:43:08,565
Rym: No, they're not.

712
00:43:08,828 --> 00:43:11,870
Scott: no No, I thought that we use them in the tactical nukes and you want to blow up like a Navy.

713
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:15,430
Rym: We don't you know, the gun type bombs are not used by anyone anymore.

714
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:15,950
Rym: Okay

715
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:16,231
Scott: at least

716
00:43:16,251 --> 00:43:21,934
Rym: as far as we can I mean as far as I can tell they might be used by that kind of Atomic artillery that

717
00:43:22,416 --> 00:43:22,596
Scott: even

718
00:43:22,636 --> 00:43:31,390
Rym: we decided it was a bad idea because the Davy Crockett The human who launched it couldn't be outside of its blast radius and that was like a hundredth of a kiloton.

719
00:43:31,832 --> 00:43:34,829
Scott: No, I thought we had them and like we'd like, you know the bombers and just drop them.

720
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:37,056
Rym: I know bombers don't use gun type weapons.

721
00:43:37,578 --> 00:43:39,965
Rym: Okay bombers don't use atomic bombs.

722
00:43:40,005 --> 00:43:41,630
Rym: They use thermonuclear weapons.

723
00:43:41,771 --> 00:43:46,230
Rym: I'm pretty sure that almost every weapon we don't have any more atomic bombs left atomic bombs.

724
00:43:47,251 --> 00:43:51,270
Rym: Oh, so this is where I want to explain things and then I'll let Scott ask questions.

725
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:52,855
Scott: I'm the rims too nerdy about this.

726
00:43:52,996 --> 00:43:54,280
Scott: He just wants to nuke everybody.

727
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:58,713
Rym: what happened with North Korea was not a Thermonuclear device.

728
00:43:58,773 --> 00:44:05,290
Rym: when people say h-bomb what they mean is a thermonuclear weapon, which is not what the Manhattan Project invented.

729
00:44:05,431 --> 00:44:10,643
Rym: Nope, specifically, they mean a two-stage Thermonuclear weapon or a teller ulam device.

730
00:44:11,125 --> 00:44:12,110
Scott: So when was that invented?

731
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:15,925
Scott: If not, if if the Manhattan Project 50s like who did that?

732
00:44:16,126 --> 00:44:19,782
Rym: us the u.s Made pretty much all the progress in nuclear weapons.

733
00:44:19,903 --> 00:44:22,559
Scott: Okay, but I mean who specifically Tell her an?

734
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,043
Rym: ulam.

735
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:25,657
Scott: Okay How can no one knows about them?

736
00:44:25,697 --> 00:44:26,641
Scott: they're not famous like.

737
00:44:26,781 --> 00:44:28,930
Rym: they're famous if you know about physics, right?

738
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:33,417
Scott: But they're not famous like, you know Oppenheimer and fine Because people don't know things about nukes.

739
00:44:33,437 --> 00:44:34,321
Rym: you can see you get the fur.

740
00:44:34,341 --> 00:44:41,729
Rym: the easiest way to know that someone doesn't know anything about nukes Is if they even say hydrogen bomb or h-bomb because those terms were invented by the press.

741
00:44:42,691 --> 00:44:46,970
Rym: But so what North Korea detonated was not a thermonuclear modern device.

742
00:44:47,331 --> 00:44:52,969
Rym: What it was is a variant of the weapon that we dropped on Nagasaki in World War two.

743
00:44:53,853 --> 00:45:01,610
Rym: So those weapons the first nuclear weapons that were ever developed were criticality weapons Meaning you've got some like uranium right and you get a lot of uranium.

744
00:45:01,891 --> 00:45:19,339
Rym: Yep, if you get too much uranium too close to itself like in too small a space or plutonium either way Yeah, then they're giving off enough radiation enough neutrons and shit to start a self-sustaining Catastrophic react like what's in a nuclear power plant?

745
00:45:20,142 --> 00:45:21,748
Rym: Uh, yeah, so those are also critical.

746
00:45:21,808 --> 00:45:23,581
Rym: They're critical They're self-sustaining.

747
00:45:23,621 --> 00:45:24,550
Rym: They just keep going, right?

748
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:33,610
Scott: So one radiation bat, you know shoots out of one molecule and hits another one and makes that one go crazy like You've got some uranium 235 and it's just popping neutrons out.

749
00:45:33,851 --> 00:45:38,710
Rym: Some of those neutrons hit more uranium and they do some stuff and they're like radiations coming out all over the place.

750
00:45:38,991 --> 00:45:42,764
Rym: This is baby's first like simple description 10th grade chemistry class.

751
00:45:43,065 --> 00:45:49,464
Rym: if you get a bunch of it together It'll start reacting which causes more reactions to happen.

752
00:45:49,564 --> 00:45:51,250
Scott: exponential increasing reaction.

753
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:57,330
Rym: Yeah, so you do that either by getting too much together or by surrounding it with something that's gonna reflect radiation.

754
00:45:57,431 --> 00:45:58,884
Rym: It's making back at itself.

755
00:45:59,227 --> 00:45:59,388
Rym: Mm-hmm.

756
00:45:59,711 --> 00:46:03,467
Rym: So there was a term for this in the old days of making nuclear weapons.

757
00:46:03,487 --> 00:46:12,490
Rym: during the Manhattan Project They called it tickling the dragon's tail because while they had Physics, you know people with pieces of paper said this is the amount.

758
00:46:13,233 --> 00:46:15,824
Rym: Someone had to test that shit and you know how dangerous that was.

759
00:46:15,844 --> 00:46:17,130
Scott: they tested it from real far away.

760
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:18,789
Rym: No, a lot of fucking people died.

761
00:46:19,592 --> 00:46:33,370
Rym: Yeah, so there's if you want to read a really depressing Wikipedia article read the article called the demon core because we had a core of Nuclear material that we called the demon core because it killed a lot of people in experimentation.

762
00:46:34,531 --> 00:46:35,434
Scott: One don't work there.

763
00:46:35,855 --> 00:46:49,077
Rym: one dude had just two halves of this thing apart and he was holding him apart with a screwdriver And he was just fucking with it and he I guess sneezed and knocked their screwdriver out and it closed and flashed And he was dead.

764
00:46:49,398 --> 00:46:51,909
Rym: he died of radiation poisoning days later like he was done.

765
00:46:52,672 --> 00:46:55,984
Scott: So if you get radiation poisoning like that, don't wait days.

766
00:46:56,004 --> 00:46:57,670
Scott: It'll just be really bad and suffering.

767
00:46:58,433 --> 00:47:04,678
Rym: Yeah, well, actually it'll be really bad and then it'll be really good and you'll feel great For like another couple days.

768
00:47:05,101 --> 00:47:06,830
Scott: Oh, yeah, you'll feel like no, how does that work?

769
00:47:07,672 --> 00:47:08,073
Rym: I don't want to.

770
00:47:08,515 --> 00:47:09,860
Rym: so that's just real depressing.

771
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,908
Rym: But basically it fucks your body up.

772
00:47:12,652 --> 00:47:15,970
Rym: So you feel bad, but then your body starts shutting down.

773
00:47:17,491 --> 00:47:23,758
Rym: So your immune response and all the things that are making you actually feel bad They turn off they turn off.

774
00:47:23,778 --> 00:47:25,908
Rym: So you feel great and then you die.

775
00:47:26,792 --> 00:47:30,750
Rym: Well, you feel bad again and then you die, but we're not talking about we're just talking about nuclear bombs.

776
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:31,950
Rym: I want to keep this real constraint.

777
00:47:33,031 --> 00:47:43,989
Rym: so the early like the first weapons we made were literally you just have a ring of uranium and I'm not like a rod of uranium and you would shoot the ring at the rod like a gun.

778
00:47:44,411 --> 00:47:47,542
Rym: They'd overlap and that would be too much critical mass.

779
00:47:47,803 --> 00:47:49,870
Rym: So they would have a catastrophic reaction and explode.

780
00:47:50,896 --> 00:47:59,610
Rym: but The reactions happen so fast like on the order of nanoseconds That the reaction would start when only a little bit of it was overlapping.

781
00:48:00,132 --> 00:48:02,178
Rym: So you'd only get a pretty minimal yield.

782
00:48:02,459 --> 00:48:08,958
Rym: you get the reaction going but then the explosion of the reaction Would break the materially apart and the reaction would stop.

783
00:48:09,039 --> 00:48:13,110
Rym: and most of that uranium just was dust and plasma and shit.

784
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:18,870
Scott: You need some way to like hold the explosion in until it's even crazier and then let it go and you want yep.

785
00:48:19,232 --> 00:48:25,935
Rym: so we made those kinds of bombs if you're evil and We dropped it on her own Hiroshima we.

786
00:48:25,995 --> 00:48:30,374
Rym: this design is so simple that we didn't even test it Like we.

787
00:48:30,394 --> 00:48:31,381
Rym: just we just dropped it.

788
00:48:31,421 --> 00:48:32,388
Scott: We just assumed it would work.

789
00:48:33,594 --> 00:48:34,278
Scott: I mean, it doesn't.

790
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,590
Scott: it doesn't explode when it hits something.

791
00:48:37,072 --> 00:48:39,262
Rym: So what loads when the gun goes off in the bomb?

792
00:48:39,302 --> 00:48:39,824
Scott: So how does?

793
00:48:39,885 --> 00:48:41,110
Scott: is it like a timer or something?

794
00:48:41,674 --> 00:48:42,318
Rym: I actually don't know.

795
00:48:42,358 --> 00:48:43,284
Rym: I don't know the details.

796
00:48:43,304 --> 00:48:44,150
Scott: There's a remote control.

797
00:48:44,972 --> 00:48:50,970
Scott: I actually do not know much about the like because I can you know You watch Looney Tunes and they're always like hitting bombs with hammers.

798
00:48:51,211 --> 00:48:57,290
Rym: So it doesn't work like that our through more thermonuclear devices like the ones that are actually crazy dangerous.

799
00:48:57,933 --> 00:49:04,323
Rym: A lot of them would have gone off if we drop them like for real Mm-hmm, like we are wet they work by get.

800
00:49:04,383 --> 00:49:05,730
Scott: if I hit one with a hammer it would go on.

801
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:08,926
Rym: Oh, they were just fucking like poorly designed and not safe.

802
00:49:09,408 --> 00:49:12,590
Rym: Oh great We designed the weapons first and the safety came way later.

803
00:49:12,771 --> 00:49:15,330
Rym: Do you know how we made the first two bombs that we actually dropped safe?

804
00:49:16,110 --> 00:49:18,778
Rym: the nuclear payload was just separate like in a box.

805
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:23,934
Rym: the plane took off and then a dude in the plane crawled down there and Activated it.

806
00:49:24,476 --> 00:49:25,199
Rym: Mm-hmm.

807
00:49:25,299 --> 00:49:27,187
Rym: So if they dropped it, it might have just gone off.

808
00:49:27,247 --> 00:49:28,030
Rym: It was some crazy crap.

809
00:49:28,573 --> 00:49:38,070
Rym: in fact, the gun bombs were so reliable that Those are the weapons that most countries developed that weren't in the current nuclear powers.

810
00:49:38,552 --> 00:49:42,709
Rym: So like South Africa with their nuclear weapons, they had a bunch of bombs like that.

811
00:49:43,694 --> 00:49:47,149
Rym: I'm pretty sure Israel has bombs and a lot of their bombs are also like that at the time.

812
00:49:48,032 --> 00:49:52,708
Rym: so the implosion bombs that we dropped in Nagasaki were much more advanced.

813
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:56,366
Rym: and So like the engineering challenge is night and day.

814
00:49:56,386 --> 00:50:06,582
Rym: instead You have a ring of high explosives tons and tons of high explosives and then they're shaped and there's Lensing like regular explosives like TNT.

815
00:50:06,743 --> 00:50:11,441
Rym: Yes, just like TNT stuff like that I think it was actually like the sort of primer cord like RDX before.

816
00:50:12,083 --> 00:50:14,230
Rym: no, it was more like RDX.

817
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:16,583
Rym: I think again, I'm not too.

818
00:50:16,624 --> 00:50:23,630
Rym: conventional bombs Yes conventional bombs tons of that shit, but you'd array it with like fast and slow propellants in different shapes.

819
00:50:23,991 --> 00:50:24,873
Rym: So you have this lens.

820
00:50:24,913 --> 00:50:40,129
Rym: so the explosion would happen with such precision that the core which was just a hollow sphere of like plutonium would be crushed Instantaneously from all directions at once and that would cause the reaction and it was significantly more powerful.

821
00:50:40,571 --> 00:50:47,088
Rym: Mmm, what North Korea just did is one of two possible things because the yield was too low.

822
00:50:47,549 --> 00:50:55,301
Rym: real thermonuclear devices have kind of a minimum yield like So high that there's no way.

823
00:50:55,402 --> 00:50:57,630
Rym: what they did was actually a thermonuclear device.

824
00:50:58,051 --> 00:51:13,470
Rym: So either they did something called boosted fission where you have a regular old Hiroshima style bomb but in that empty core you fill it with something like lithium and Basically, it'll compress in and do the normal atomic bomb thing.

825
00:51:13,771 --> 00:51:16,799
Rym: But that middle part will fuse from the pressure.

826
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,487
Rym: that fusion reaction will make a ton of neutrons.

827
00:51:19,748 --> 00:51:22,697
Rym: that then just do Crazy more fission.

828
00:51:23,158 --> 00:51:26,930
Scott: So it's still mostly a little bit the lithiums who are in the middle of the explosion.

829
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:28,930
Scott: They fuse together and make who knows what?

830
00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:36,598
Rym: fusion fission Like boom all at once and the yield of that Could be like ten to a hundred times more.

831
00:51:36,639 --> 00:51:39,970
Rym: like you could make a bomb like that and get up to almost a megaton.

832
00:51:40,071 --> 00:51:41,389
Rym: If you really tried.

833
00:51:42,311 --> 00:51:42,693
Scott: That's just.

834
00:51:42,874 --> 00:51:44,301
Scott: that's really yeah.

835
00:51:44,342 --> 00:51:45,950
Scott: So a megaton that sounds great.

836
00:51:46,151 --> 00:51:47,718
Rym: Yeah, so to give you a one.

837
00:51:47,798 --> 00:51:50,369
Rym: so to give you a reference because I tweeted about this a while ago.

838
00:51:51,851 --> 00:52:01,369
Rym: The weapons that the United States used in World War two were ten to twenty kiloton meaning 10,000 tons of TNT equivalent explosion.

839
00:52:02,771 --> 00:52:13,549
Rym: the biggest nuclear weapons ever designed were on the order of 50 to 100 megatons a hundred million tons of TNT.

840
00:52:13,569 --> 00:52:21,531
Rym: a Fusion boosted bomb could be ten to a hundred times more than the weapons that were the weapons that were actually used in the real World.

841
00:52:21,893 --> 00:52:25,610
Rym: so that is the best case for North Korea of what they developed.

842
00:52:25,871 --> 00:52:35,628
Rym: They figured out how to make the the output of their regular crappy old-school atomic bombs be where they even get any radioactive stuff from.

843
00:52:36,772 --> 00:52:37,938
Rym: That's an interesting question.

844
00:52:37,958 --> 00:52:38,963
Scott: I mean is it is it?

845
00:52:39,023 --> 00:52:40,370
Scott: can they mine it in North Korea?

846
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:42,575
Rym: That I actually don't know.

847
00:52:42,595 --> 00:52:44,020
Scott: can they refine it in North Korea?

848
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,469
Rym: Apparently they did or someone gave it to them.

849
00:52:48,011 --> 00:52:49,215
Rym: So we'll see.

850
00:52:49,235 --> 00:52:51,702
Rym: I mean, it's kind of a secretive state.

851
00:52:51,783 --> 00:52:54,030
Rym: China sort of just tells everyone to stay away.

852
00:52:54,312 --> 00:52:55,261
Scott: I mean, it's like that's.

853
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:56,149
Scott: it's hard to get.

854
00:52:57,096 --> 00:53:03,990
Rym: In fact, one of the reasons that the u.s Had so many atomic weapons after World War two is that we had uranium in our country.

855
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:10,050
Rym: We could just dig it up and Russia for a long time had no known source of uranium.

856
00:53:10,351 --> 00:53:11,115
Rym: They found Russia.

857
00:53:11,155 --> 00:53:11,738
Scott: They found some.

858
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:12,743
Rym: they found some later.

859
00:53:12,763 --> 00:53:16,550
Rym: There's a lot of Russia to find it Yeah, but early on they didn't have it sure.

860
00:53:16,971 --> 00:53:18,496
Rym: So and the difference.

861
00:53:18,516 --> 00:53:23,110
Rym: so the other thing that North Korea could have done is doing that civilization, right?

862
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:25,004
Scott: It's like I got horses you don't.

863
00:53:25,527 --> 00:53:27,255
Scott: so the other Horses.

864
00:53:27,315 --> 00:53:33,871
Rym: because one thing that they might have done it might have been a boosted fission weapon Which was what the u.s Made.

865
00:53:33,971 --> 00:53:39,790
Rym: we made a huge stockpile of those things in the Cold War ready to just lob with conventional bombers.

866
00:53:40,512 --> 00:53:44,184
Rym: the other thing they might have done is they might have made a sloica style device.

867
00:53:44,485 --> 00:53:47,590
Rym: sloica is like a. it's a pastry cake in Russia.

868
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:53,850
Rym: It's like a layer cake and a sloica device is layers and layers of like that fission fission fission fission fission.

869
00:53:54,091 --> 00:54:00,510
Rym: So it's more like an advanced version of a boosted fission weapon and those things are a dead end.

870
00:54:00,611 --> 00:54:02,170
Rym: We learned from physics later.

871
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:06,867
Rym: Like that theory Peters out at about a megaton and isn't really viable as a weapon.

872
00:54:06,907 --> 00:54:10,443
Scott: like they're okay But a megaton bomb isn't viable as a weapon.

873
00:54:10,463 --> 00:54:11,770
Scott: if I drop that on you, you'll be fine.

874
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:16,850
Rym: Well, it's a megaton, but it's also kind of big and unwieldy and there's problems with that sort of design.

875
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:18,564
Scott: I'll put in my giant plane and drop it on you.

876
00:54:18,584 --> 00:54:19,290
Scott: what you do about it.

877
00:54:19,330 --> 00:54:22,309
Rym: So North Korea has either one of those two things.

878
00:54:23,052 --> 00:54:26,763
Rym: The ramifications however are not what a lot of people are like.

879
00:54:26,884 --> 00:54:28,870
Rym: Oh now they can make real nuclear weapons.

880
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:31,458
Rym: Not really the ramifications are still bad though.

881
00:54:31,478 --> 00:54:38,550
Rym: Don't get me wrong if they made a boosted fission weapon the former type That doesn't mean they're gonna be making like more powerful weapons.

882
00:54:39,032 --> 00:54:45,697
Rym: That means they can take their existing style weapons and put them on missiles Which they their enemy.

883
00:54:45,717 --> 00:54:48,105
Scott: their enemy is not far away, that's the real.

884
00:54:48,165 --> 00:54:49,570
Scott: see if their enemy was us.

885
00:54:49,993 --> 00:54:51,323
Scott: We don't really have much to worry about.

886
00:54:51,363 --> 00:54:53,073
Scott: no matter what they have Yeah There's.

887
00:54:53,093 --> 00:54:59,870
Scott: no matter how much atomic technology they have they don't have Something that can fly halfway around the world and land in New York.

888
00:55:00,251 --> 00:55:07,210
Rym: Best weapon they have the best missile at least could theoretically hit the west coast at its extreme range, right and accurately.

889
00:55:07,592 --> 00:55:12,796
Scott: No, it would probably land in like the forest or on some hippies, dude Accurately the.

890
00:55:13,058 --> 00:55:19,021
Rym: there's a. there's a term called the CEP 50 Circular error probable which is the percentage.

891
00:55:19,402 --> 00:55:20,665
Rym: basically it's the radius.

892
00:55:21,448 --> 00:55:26,150
Rym: if you launch a nuke Where there is a 50/50 shot it'll land within that radius.

893
00:55:26,932 --> 00:55:27,594
Rym: Think about that.

894
00:55:27,694 --> 00:55:30,020
Rym: So some CEPs were in the miles.

895
00:55:30,341 --> 00:55:34,010
Rym: So here's a circle of like five miles in diameter.

896
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:34,553
Rym: There's a 50/50.

897
00:55:34,553 --> 00:55:35,197
Rym: There's a 50% chance.

898
00:55:35,298 --> 00:55:39,620
Rym: It'll land Somewhere in that area.

899
00:55:39,701 --> 00:55:41,830
Scott: So from here to work is about five miles.

900
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:45,460
Scott: So 50/50 it'll land between here and work or somewhere else.

901
00:55:45,941 --> 00:55:51,650
Rym: Yeah, so somewhere else bomb the wrong place, Vermont That's part of the horror of nuclear weapons.

902
00:55:51,770 --> 00:56:00,030
Rym: The the things that we had after World War two were not only terrifying in their power But they were inaccurate as shit, right?

903
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:03,984
Scott: So now we just send them into space and they land in exactly the right spot.

904
00:56:04,044 --> 00:56:15,440
Rym: So North Korea might have Developed boosted fission weapons meaning they could take nuclear weapons that they can already make today and Deliver them somewhere nearby like Japan or South Korea.

905
00:56:16,042 --> 00:56:17,547
Rym: That's not anything to sneeze at.

906
00:56:18,048 --> 00:56:25,469
Rym: the other thing They could have done is developed a sloica style device meaning they could make a megaton weapon, but probably couldn't deliver it anywhere.

907
00:56:26,452 --> 00:56:31,546
Rym: Neither one of these while they have sociopolitical ramifications is a modern nuclear weapon.

908
00:56:32,207 --> 00:56:36,424
Scott: the engineering Challenge and by modern you mean how old yeah, so the 50s.

909
00:56:36,444 --> 00:56:43,430
Scott: Yeah Okay, so there has development since then are probably a non-existent or be secret.

910
00:56:43,931 --> 00:56:46,961
Rym: Oh the teller ulam design is secret.

911
00:56:47,001 --> 00:56:59,300
Rym: like you can go look up Scott you and I together Anyone who knows even basic physics and engineering could make a gun type uranium nuclear weapon if they had if we had uranium Which we don't if you had the materials.

912
00:56:59,622 --> 00:57:03,269
Scott: the engineering challenge You can't get it at the chemistry lab because they don't have enough.

913
00:57:04,092 --> 00:57:08,930
Rym: The implosion type weapons the engineering challenge is a like an order of magnitude more.

914
00:57:09,312 --> 00:57:12,129
Rym: It's very difficult to make that lensing and they're huge.

915
00:57:13,073 --> 00:57:19,816
Rym: The fission boosted weapons or the fusion boosted fission weapons boosted fission Sloica all those things.

916
00:57:20,459 --> 00:57:37,680
Rym: the engineering challenge is substantial but I cannot express to you the gulf in Engineering challenge between even the most advanced like a weapon that could ever be conceived and a modern thermonuclear device The fact that only five countries in the world.

917
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:42,322
Rym: arguably four have ever developed that technology And some of them were just gifted.

918
00:57:42,342 --> 00:57:43,410
Scott: they didn't figure it out on their own.

919
00:57:43,470 --> 00:57:48,489
Rym: Yeah, I mean the Soviets were kind of on the right track, but there was a lot of espionage going on.

920
00:57:49,152 --> 00:57:51,620
Rym: We shared a lot of secrets with Britain France.

921
00:57:51,661 --> 00:57:54,350
Rym: There was a lot of sharing going on and apparently a lot of espionage.

922
00:57:55,211 --> 00:57:58,344
Rym: This stuff is not easy to develop like people talk about India and Pakistan.

923
00:57:58,384 --> 00:57:58,565
Rym: Nope.

924
00:57:58,967 --> 00:57:59,830
Rym: They don't have those weapons.

925
00:57:59,911 --> 00:58:01,381
Rym: They do not have thermonuclear weapons.

926
00:58:01,401 --> 00:58:02,590
Scott: I think about calculus, right?

927
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:14,066
Scott: There's always some story about someone who lives in the sticks somewhere who never took math class who figures out calculus on their own And has just different terms for everything and different symbols or who knows what but it is calculus.

928
00:58:14,106 --> 00:58:28,566
Scott: They figured out independently Pretty much only once in the history of the entire world Despite half a century of trying plus Only one people's ever were able to figure out as far as we know how to make this thing.

929
00:58:28,606 --> 00:58:39,244
Rym: Maybe two and it took a huge percentage of the GDP of the most powerful and economically viable country in the world decades to design that.

930
00:58:39,566 --> 00:58:50,988
Rym: it also required Constant testing by blowing up nukes Mm-hmm, so because we have the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and because no one's allowed to test new.

931
00:58:51,108 --> 00:58:56,629
Scott: and if you Even if you wanted to test nukes and you didn't care about the treaty everyone else will know immediately.

932
00:58:56,649 --> 00:58:59,358
Scott: Yes I mean the whole unless you just keep failing.

933
00:58:59,558 --> 00:59:03,330
Rym: the world knew within which case keep going that North Korea tried this bullshit.

934
00:59:03,691 --> 00:59:14,813
Scott: And we knew within hours that either they develop you can't do it secret Even if you did at the core of the earth or in space everyone can see or find you with their Richter scale Seismograph, whatever.

935
00:59:14,833 --> 00:59:20,090
Rym: It is such a secret that actually no one knows for real how to make them Like.

936
00:59:20,131 --> 00:59:21,215
Rym: we know the theory you can look up.

937
00:59:21,255 --> 00:59:33,319
Rym: you'll see these diagrams like everyone see the diagrams of what a modern nuke looks like But the actual engineering even if I had a whole pile of plutonium in the closet and I was totally Radiation-proof like Superman or something.

938
00:59:33,641 --> 00:59:35,630
Scott: I still couldn't do it, right?

939
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:39,130
Scott: I couldn't get it to blow up that way because it's that hard to figure out how to make that happen.

940
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:49,504
Rym: And that is a good thing because the true horror of thermonuclear weapons and I can't do trial and error because everyone will see me Trying is that their yield is literally unlimited.

941
00:59:49,865 --> 00:59:53,941
Rym: There is nothing Limiting the power of a nuclear weapon.

942
00:59:53,981 --> 00:59:55,989
Scott: You can make one that just blows up the solar system like boop.

943
00:59:56,212 --> 01:00:06,182
Rym: Yeah Modern nuclear weapons where there's a term dial a yield or a variable yield where you just pick what yield you want from the weapon And it has an upper limit because it does have a lower limit.

944
01:00:06,202 --> 01:00:08,070
Scott: Can I be like I'd just be like one ton?

945
01:00:08,552 --> 01:00:10,300
Rym: So that's where things get kind of complicated.

946
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:12,610
Rym: So this is where I want to ask you questions Scott.

947
01:00:12,791 --> 01:00:14,097
Rym: Have you ever heard of a neutron bomb?

948
01:00:14,619 --> 01:00:16,850
Rym: Yeah, I mean, what do you think a neutron bomb is?

949
01:00:17,050 --> 01:00:17,231
Scott: I don't.

950
01:00:17,291 --> 01:00:21,533
Scott: I'm pretty sure that this is complete bullshit because it's just sort of that, you know I don't follow you.

951
01:00:21,694 --> 01:00:24,563
Scott: It's one of those stories that people tell that's complete bullshit.

952
01:00:24,603 --> 01:00:26,630
Scott: Like hey, there's a secret in more.

953
01:00:26,670 --> 01:00:29,855
Scott: You know Mario you can go to this right up and down 65,535 times right exactly.

954
01:00:32,410 --> 01:00:36,210
Scott: So the story the kids tell about the neutron bomb in school, right?

955
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:42,190
Scott: Cuz like I'm not as morbid as Rym where I actually want to research such horrible things other than make them no longer exist.

956
01:00:43,352 --> 01:00:52,050
Scott: the story kids tell about the neutron bomb is that it goes off and Shit doesn't blow up like all the buildings in the in everywhere will just be perfectly intact.

957
01:00:52,130 --> 01:00:56,844
Scott: It doesn't blow up everything but it shoots neutrons everywhere really fast and it kills everybody.

958
01:00:56,864 --> 01:00:59,070
Scott: and but it doesn't destroy anything.

959
01:00:59,391 --> 01:01:00,938
Rym: So they're not actually a special bomb.

960
01:01:01,078 --> 01:01:03,750
Scott: all it is sort of like cosmic rays hitting your computer, right?

961
01:01:04,011 --> 01:01:06,749
Scott: You don't see them hitting your computer, but they still flip a bit.

962
01:01:07,111 --> 01:01:11,350
Scott: You know the neutrons would come and like destroy your body because your body is and kill yourself.

963
01:01:11,491 --> 01:01:13,221
Scott: So but it wouldn't kill.

964
01:01:13,302 --> 01:01:14,590
Scott: a building is just concrete.

965
01:01:14,831 --> 01:01:20,210
Rym: So actually the effective radius of the neutrons is about the same as the explosion radius.

966
01:01:20,692 --> 01:01:23,967
Rym: Yeah, the only reason neutron bombs existed was to take out tanks.

967
01:01:24,369 --> 01:01:28,384
Rym: Mm-hmm Because if you blow them up, it'll kill all the unprotected people because the explosion.

968
01:01:28,705 --> 01:01:29,930
Rym: but the people in the tanks would be fine.

969
01:01:30,291 --> 01:01:39,903
Rym: The neutrons make the tanks so radioactive that the tanks then kill everyone inside the tanks immediately From the from the nuclear radiation, but it's true that it doesn't blow everything up.

970
01:01:40,264 --> 01:01:41,830
Rym: No, it blows everything up within its radius.

971
01:01:41,830 --> 01:01:44,949
Rym: It's just the radius isn't that big but it's not a special bomb.

972
01:01:45,331 --> 01:01:49,145
Rym: Neutron bombs are just thermonuclear weapons with the yield dialed all the way down.

973
01:01:49,687 --> 01:01:55,229
Rym: Uh-huh So actually dialing the yield down makes them more horrifying in a different way.

974
01:01:55,993 --> 01:02:00,313
Scott: So you couldn't dial the yield down say to make really efficient say Useful.

975
01:02:00,413 --> 01:02:05,910
Scott: in modern-day construction bombs like I want to make a big tunnel under the river to put a train through.

976
01:02:06,211 --> 01:02:10,990
Scott: Let me use this in a practical and non evil mechanism by turning the yield down.

977
01:02:11,071 --> 01:02:11,829
Scott: So it just makes a ton.

978
01:02:12,011 --> 01:02:17,496
Rym: Oh, you have to have the high after the yield pretty high up but with a thermonuclear device There's a sweet spot where.

979
01:02:17,797 --> 01:02:27,650
Rym: so you have the nuclear weapon that goes off and has its yield of like a megaton or ten Megatons or whatever, but like Tsar Bomba is an example because that's the most horrific thing humans ever made.

980
01:02:28,171 --> 01:02:28,874
Rym: That was a fifth.

981
01:02:28,894 --> 01:02:30,700
Rym: Well, that was a hundred megaton weapon.

982
01:02:31,121 --> 01:02:33,570
Rym: The Soviets detonated it at half power.

983
01:02:33,913 --> 01:02:36,957
Rym: They dialed the yield of 50% Mm-hmm, and the.

984
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:51,436
Rym: the results of that test were catastrophic, but The difference between the 50 and the hundred megaton version is that the 50 megaton version you have a nuclear device and it's wrapped in Inert material like lead.

985
01:02:51,456 --> 01:02:52,701
Rym: Mm-hmm.

986
01:02:52,721 --> 01:02:54,810
Scott: So a lot doesn't let radiation get out.

987
01:02:55,010 --> 01:02:56,555
Rym: Well, no, it's more that it.

988
01:02:56,575 --> 01:02:57,538
Rym: that's just to hold it together.

989
01:02:57,558 --> 01:02:57,979
Rym: Mm-hmm.

990
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:08,390
Rym: So a lot of the actual explosion is fusion Which means that the energy yield is primarily from that and not that much fallout is generated.

991
01:03:08,993 --> 01:03:11,485
Scott: Well, that's good at least better than you know, I mean you still.

992
01:03:11,927 --> 01:03:12,510
Scott: it's still horrible.

993
01:03:12,530 --> 01:03:23,410
Rym: so if you were doing peaceful nuclear weapons like excavation or whatever theoretically to use that kind of weapon because the Actual fallout is relatively low like reasonably acceptable for some use cases.

994
01:03:24,032 --> 01:03:42,882
Rym: However to make an efficient weapon if you replace that lead with say uranium Then the 50 megatons goes off and that causes all that uranium to do fission and you double your yield with a minimal increase in weight and The radiation is uranium really heavy though.

995
01:03:42,962 --> 01:03:43,867
Scott: I guess lead is heavy.

996
01:03:43,947 --> 01:03:47,883
Rym: Uranium is open From from that kind of weapon is horrific.

997
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:49,489
Scott: Well, I mean, it's all horrific.

998
01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:55,510
Scott: Yeah Even more horrific than regular horrific on the scale of nuclear weapons.

999
01:03:55,972 --> 01:04:00,510
Rym: But I guess my only last question for you Scott is how do you think a thermonuclear device works?

1000
01:04:00,810 --> 01:04:01,716
Rym: No one seen diagrams.

1001
01:04:01,756 --> 01:04:02,561
Scott: Nobody knows.

1002
01:04:02,581 --> 01:04:03,890
Rym: Yeah, no one knows.

1003
01:04:03,930 --> 01:04:06,670
Scott: There's some isn't there like some mysterious code name like fog bank?

1004
01:04:06,770 --> 01:04:11,490
Rym: No, thanks is something probably an aerogel of some kind that's used to hold everything together an arrow.

1005
01:04:12,452 --> 01:04:15,386
Scott: You know about aerogels, yeah, but why an aerogel is gonna hold in that?

1006
01:04:15,406 --> 01:04:16,712
Rym: no So the area.

1007
01:04:16,932 --> 01:04:20,184
Rym: so the best theory we've got and this is why it's such a challenge.

1008
01:04:20,224 --> 01:04:21,147
Rym: This is the best we know.

1009
01:04:21,267 --> 01:04:25,261
Rym: basically a Boosted fission bomb goes off first.

1010
01:04:25,522 --> 01:04:27,110
Rym: Mm-hmm, but that's just a little baby bomb.

1011
01:04:28,232 --> 01:04:31,770
Rym: It's not the explosion or anything else that causes the fusion reaction.

1012
01:04:32,733 --> 01:04:35,069
Rym: that bomb generates x-rays.

1013
01:04:35,854 --> 01:04:37,402
Rym: So many x-rays.

1014
01:04:37,744 --> 01:04:44,610
Rym: the x-rays are Channeled via basically a big lens and a containment system into the second stage of the weapon.

1015
01:04:44,873 --> 01:04:47,353
Rym: You can have any number of stages They're just fusion all the way down.

1016
01:04:48,055 --> 01:04:58,990
Rym: the x-rays themselves are so much that they compress the secondary Mm-hmm, so light photons are compressing the secondary.

1017
01:04:59,010 --> 01:05:01,405
Scott: So the dialing is adjusting the how much x-rays.

1018
01:05:01,767 --> 01:05:03,416
Rym: maybe It's not it's.

1019
01:05:03,677 --> 01:05:05,567
Rym: that's where we don't know a lot about that's.

1020
01:05:05,667 --> 01:05:06,230
Scott: that's the trick.

1021
01:05:06,290 --> 01:05:08,910
Scott: Is that you know, it's not just something that you set off, right?

1022
01:05:08,990 --> 01:05:09,535
Scott: There's a way.

1023
01:05:09,596 --> 01:05:11,009
Scott: we know that there's a way to dial it.

1024
01:05:11,411 --> 01:05:14,905
Scott: So there's something that you can adjust how much at some point.

1025
01:05:14,986 --> 01:05:15,769
Rym: so think of it this way.

1026
01:05:16,613 --> 01:05:19,750
Rym: What do you think the engineering challenge is of all the timing?

1027
01:05:20,210 --> 01:05:27,210
Rym: Necessary to have a burst of x-rays such that they physically compress something to the point that it fuses, right?

1028
01:05:27,210 --> 01:05:29,770
Scott: Because you can make a bunch of x-rays, but you don't make them all at once.

1029
01:05:29,810 --> 01:05:31,458
Scott: They don't get to the destination all at once.

1030
01:05:31,759 --> 01:05:34,170
Rym: it ain't gonna happen and it's not a physics problem.

1031
01:05:34,271 --> 01:05:37,249
Rym: A lot of people can come up with a lot of ideas as to how that would work.

1032
01:05:37,792 --> 01:05:40,950
Scott: But yeah, I mean you could think you mean like you could just make a Sun right?

1033
01:05:41,010 --> 01:05:42,057
Scott: It's like we know how the Sun works.

1034
01:05:42,339 --> 01:05:43,930
Scott: We know the chemistry of how the Sun works.

1035
01:05:43,930 --> 01:05:47,350
Scott: It's like well get us, you know, I can write down on paper.

1036
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:51,489
Scott: Well, it's helium fuses together and then it makes you know, you get enough of it and you're good.

1037
01:05:52,032 --> 01:05:56,350
Scott: But how do you actually make that happen in a space?

1038
01:05:56,892 --> 01:05:59,504
Scott: You have I give you tanks of helium as much as you want.

1039
01:05:59,685 --> 01:06:00,830
Scott: You have your own space lab.

1040
01:06:01,112 --> 01:06:02,021
Scott: It's in outer space.

1041
01:06:02,223 --> 01:06:09,030
Scott: you can have any Elements for the periodic table that you want in any quantity and you won't die and you can have any machine you want.

1042
01:06:09,552 --> 01:06:10,999
Scott: How are you gonna make a star?

1043
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:12,727
Scott: you get to make a nebula first, right?

1044
01:06:12,747 --> 01:06:14,781
Scott: It takes too long It's not gonna work.

1045
01:06:14,962 --> 01:06:28,424
Rym: the engineering channel the the engineering to make a thermonuclear device from what North Korea did a few days ago would be like Your your warrior in Civ 5 Trying to make the spaceships.

1046
01:06:28,464 --> 01:06:34,085
Scott: at the end of the game It'd be like, you know, if at home you just started making i7s in your closet.

1047
01:06:34,205 --> 01:06:35,229
Scott: Yeah, it's like you can't do.

1048
01:06:35,469 --> 01:06:43,634
Rym: actually It'd be easier to make It would be easier for a country like North Korea to make a chip as fast as the i7 that it would be for them To engineer.

1049
01:06:43,714 --> 01:06:46,807
Scott: No, but I'm saying you in your closet making an i7.

1050
01:06:46,847 --> 01:06:53,441
Scott: It's like yeah You couldn't you know, even if I gave you the plans for it It's like and I gave you silicon you couldn't.

1051
01:06:53,923 --> 01:06:55,530
Scott: you couldn't print on that silicon.

1052
01:06:55,570 --> 01:06:56,254
Scott: What are you gonna do?

1053
01:06:56,475 --> 01:06:59,329
Scott: get a laser and start drawing on it and you're not clean room?

1054
01:07:00,371 --> 01:07:01,836
Scott: So I got nothing to end this.

1055
01:07:01,916 --> 01:07:11,937
Rym: on a kind of a positive note two atomic weapons were used in human history And we're not gonna debate about by luck And many near misses.

1056
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:14,667
Scott: we have thankfully not used any since.

1057
01:07:14,888 --> 01:07:17,575
Rym: but yeah Except for testing.

1058
01:07:18,116 --> 01:07:18,938
Scott: For on people.

1059
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:27,900
Rym: The power of those weapons pales so powerfully small Before the power of actual thermonuclear devices.

1060
01:07:28,662 --> 01:07:31,370
Scott: and the fact that and people don't really realize that that's you know.

1061
01:07:31,370 --> 01:07:34,030
Scott: They just think atomic bomb and they think of Japan and that's all they think about.

1062
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:38,905
Scott: they don't realize that this much more horrific bomb has been made and is the only thing that we have and

1063
01:07:38,925 --> 01:07:55,219
Rym: the fact that in the So many generations of humans decades and decades and decades and decades, I mean from the 50s until We have no human has ever used one of these weapons Says I hope it says a lot about us.

1064
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:56,465
Scott: Well used them on people.

1065
01:07:56,485 --> 01:07:58,990
Rym: Uh, well, yeah Well, we used them on people by accident.

1066
01:07:58,990 --> 01:08:09,750
Rym: We used them on trees and rocks a lot and water because the US military after World War two Basically treated those weapons just like a natural extension of bomber technology.

1067
01:08:10,231 --> 01:08:17,270
Rym: It wasn't until Castle Bravo when they developed an eight megaton weapon that was accidentally 15 megatons.

1068
01:08:17,792 --> 01:08:24,608
Rym: That was when the general started saying whoa Maybe we go too far You and play gods?

1069
01:08:25,951 --> 01:08:31,749
Rym: yeah, like that was when they started treating them like something fundamentally unique.

1070
01:08:31,769 --> 01:08:44,332
Rym: and It's also a testament that humans have never been able to develop these again And that somehow despite the fact that Russia the US China If playing gods was easy we wouldn't be here.

1071
01:08:44,474 --> 01:08:46,582
Rym: five countries in the world have developed this technology.

1072
01:08:47,023 --> 01:08:53,166
Rym: two of them hate each other and most of the rest of us at least in terms of geopolitics at different stages through history.

1073
01:08:53,689 --> 01:08:56,176
Rym: and yet No one's ever shared the secret.

1074
01:08:56,599 --> 01:09:13,200
Rym: No one else has ever figured out the secret and no one's ever used This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott special Thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1075
01:09:13,501 --> 01:09:15,468
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at front row.

1076
01:09:15,508 --> 01:09:18,520
Scott: crew comm for show notes discussion news and more.

1077
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:25,939
Rym: Remember GeekNights is not one but four different shows sci-tech Mondays gaming Tuesdays anime comic Wednesdays and indiscriminate Thursdays.

01:09:30,981 --> 01:09:34,069
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1080
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:35,734
Scott: But unlike those other late shows.

1081
01:09:35,876 --> 01:09:37,180
Scott: It's actually recorded at night.

1082
01:09:53,063 --> 01:10:05,088
Rym: The patrons in order of the amount of money they give us are Nicholas Brando Rebecca Dunn Amanda Duchette James David white Christian coons Jess mechanical mind William Eisen rose.

1083
01:10:05,149 --> 01:10:06,879
Rym: the donation is coming from inside the house.

1084
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:10,111
Rym: Clinton Walton my state e.com.

1085
01:10:10,231 --> 01:10:32,599
Rym: Phil Ulrich Renee from New Zealand Robert Lee Ryan Perrin drew open Lander rare Lavelle Brian Sidroni Rochelle, Mantanona Finn Eric Solver Rym eats poop kinetic man Aaron Cerise Chris midkiff Chris Knox flame darkfire Samuel Cordery Daniel Redmond Chris Haddad Doug Schneider Sean Klein Chris Reimer and Thomas Hahn.

1086
01:10:33,781 --> 01:10:38,860
Rym: We finished shooting of episodes 14 and 15 of GeekNights presents utenna on Sunday.

1087
01:10:39,322 --> 01:10:50,720
Rym: So I'm actually in the middle of editing now and I'm gonna try to get at least one of those fully together with the new process and everything Before I go away for a long ski trip at the beginning of February.

1088
01:10:51,322 --> 01:10:57,400
Rym: So I'll keep this one short because we just also recorded the December Q&A which will be out this week.

1089
01:10:58,163 --> 01:11:20,280
Rym: There's a little bit of trouble and I lost Scott's audio for the first half of it but I had the backup running but the backup was not calibrated great because I rarely have to go to the backup and I Realized that our process has post hoc post record Compression so I don't have compression in line on the pre-record like I did with the old rig.

1090
01:11:20,724 --> 01:11:27,316
Rym: So as a result Scott's voice clips a bit But that gets cleared up about halfway through because I only lost the first half of Scott's audio.

1091
01:11:27,336 --> 01:11:28,539
Rym: So it's all in there.

1092
01:11:29,444 --> 01:11:38,946
Rym: All patrons will get the GeekNights December 2015 Q&A Very soon and I will now open up the question submission for GeekNights 2016 patreon Q&A.

1093
01:11:39,568 --> 01:12:04,039
Rym: and now I leave you with something really really A nine-tailed fox suddenly appeared if you believe it My ninja clan ninja clan.

1094
01:12:04,279 --> 01:12:06,245
Scott: here we stand Naruto.

1095
01:12:06,566 --> 01:12:08,050
Rym: I'm on my way Naruto.

1096
01:12:08,050 --> 01:12:11,421
Rym: I'll be okay getting ready to fight on set.

1097
01:12:11,702 --> 01:12:13,428
Scott: Come on best friends by my side.

1098
01:12:13,468 --> 01:12:14,090
Rym: That's okay.

1099
01:12:14,533 --> 01:12:21,595
Scott: He's really cool Sakura the beautiful Oh.
