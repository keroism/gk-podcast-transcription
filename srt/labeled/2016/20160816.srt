1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,589
Rym: It's Tuesday, August 16th, 2016.

2
00:00:11,589 --> 00:00:15,360
Rym: I'm Rym, he's Scott, and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:20,360
Rym: Tonight, we're talking about that post-mortem of the Warbits game that was pretty good on iOS.

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,618
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:31,420
Rym: So I know some of you, not a lot of you, it's kind of a niche thing, because I haven't been doing a lot of livestreaming lately, I've just been busy.

6
00:00:33,141 --> 00:00:42,979
Rym: And while I could livestream Overwatch, it is a slightly negative performance issue, because my computer is not great at playing Overwatch, it's the minimum, I guess.

7
00:00:44,101 --> 00:00:48,300
Rym: So I'm not going to risk it, because Overwatch is serious business, and yeah.

8
00:00:48,660 --> 00:01:02,858
Rym: So I have been putting up those five videos, and one thing I've noticed that's kind of funny, is when I upload more shorter videos, half of you complain like, "Ah, the videos are all short, like I don't want to watch this five minute

9
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:03,140
Rym: video.".

10
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,119
Scott: Those are punk kids who can play JRPGs.

11
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:13,657
Rym: And if I upload one that's like a compilation of like 50 turns in a row that's like 45 minutes long, the other half of you are like, "Ah, I can't watch this long ass fucking

12
00:01:13,677 --> 00:01:14,040
Rym: video.".

13
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:14,738
Scott: Those are adults.

14
00:01:15,721 --> 00:01:26,080
Rym: Ah, and then the use cases are split between, now here's the problem, some of you are trying to watch these videos of me and Scott playing Civ 5 duels against each other, to learn about Civ 5, that ain't going to happen.

15
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,459
Scott: You're not learning about Civ 5 from me.

16
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:33,777
Rym: Yeah, and you're not even learning from me, because half the last video is me saying, "Well, I guess Scott's not going to defend that

17
00:01:33,817 --> 00:01:34,180
Rym: caravan.".

18
00:01:34,841 --> 00:01:36,399
Rym: Wow, Scott really doesn't have another city?

19
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,820
Scott: I was trying to defend the caravan.

20
00:01:40,162 --> 00:01:46,180
Rym: The next video actually, though, is the end of that game, then we start a brand new game, and that video is mostly Scott explaining why he lost.

21
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:52,200
Scott: You know, if you can make a 50 minute video, you could just make 10 five minute videos.

22
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,613
Rym: Aha, but 50% of you complain.

23
00:01:54,700 --> 00:02:00,559
Scott: Upload them all at once, and if someone wants a long one, they can just watch them all back to back, and if someone wants a short one, they can watch them one at a time.

24
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:01,579
Rym: Yeah, so we'll see.

25
00:02:01,661 --> 00:02:03,479
Rym: The thing is, here's the real story, guys.

26
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,719
Rym: The duels of me and Scott is a series that I just kind of called Rym vs.

27
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:14,919
Rym: Scott, and I assume we'll eventually just start playing other games and just putting them all in that long, giant playlist of games where we fight against each other.

28
00:02:16,502 --> 00:02:44,820
Rym: The actual Civ 5 video I'm making, I can't even start publishing yet, because the game's still going, but that giant GMR game we started a long time ago, I just got Gatling guns, and shit's getting lit in that game, but I'm not posting any videos from it until the game's over, because I don't want any spying or knowledge of things I might have done along the way, but that's definitely going to be an episodic, like, what's going on in the world today with entirely peaceful and prosperous Portugal.

29
00:02:46,745 --> 00:02:47,478
Rym: So, yeah, what's up?

30
00:02:48,941 --> 00:02:54,540
Scott: Alright, so, I don't have any news, gaming-wise, but I did play this game that Rym's not going to play.

31
00:02:55,002 --> 00:02:55,691
Rym: I'm not going to play it?

32
00:02:55,731 --> 00:02:56,319
Rym: Should I play it?

33
00:02:56,842 --> 00:03:00,918
Scott: I mean, I would recommend it, but, you know, it'll last you maybe a day or two.

34
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,880
Scott: So, I'm going to do some Geek Bite, which you haven't done in a while.

35
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:04,104
Scott: Yeah.

36
00:03:05,121 --> 00:03:07,180
Scott: So, this game, you may have heard of it, it's called Dub Wars.

37
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:14,340
Scott: I discovered it because, you know, the Penny Arcade guys do these, like, 15 minutes things on their YouTube channel.

38
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,420
Rym: Like the first 15?

39
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:23,360
Scott: Yeah, they play a game for 15 minutes exactly, that they've never played before, and you just watch them play it for the first 15 minutes, and then they stop.

40
00:03:24,163 --> 00:03:24,780
Rym: It's a good format.

41
00:03:25,564 --> 00:03:34,980
Scott: Yeah, so, this game is called Dub Wars, and what it is is a twin-stick shooter, like Robotron or Geometry Wars, or, I mean, you get the idea.

42
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:48,258
Scott: But unlike every other twin-stick shooter that you've ever played, there is one key difference, and that is the left stick moves, the right stick aims, there is no button to control the shootin'.

43
00:03:49,282 --> 00:03:52,072
Scott: You cannot shoot by pressing any other button.

44
00:03:52,173 --> 00:03:54,060
Scott: All you got is two analog sticks, and that's it.

45
00:03:54,322 --> 00:03:56,500
Rym: Huh, it's like dive kick, but it's move shoot.

46
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:57,778
Scott: Well, it's move aim.

47
00:03:58,221 --> 00:03:58,263
Scott: Ah.

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,030
Scott: The shooting is uncontrolled by you.

49
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:05,080
Scott: The shooting occurs along with the music.

50
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,127
Scott: So, it's really a game about music.

51
00:04:07,227 --> 00:04:18,240
Scott: Each level in the game is a different song, and a different background, and a different enemy pattern, and when the level is loading, the screen is, like, promoting the artist who made that song.

52
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:30,538
Scott: It, like, gives you the sound cloud links, and shows you a picture of them, and tells you where they're from, and what kind of musical stylings they have, and it's really almost an advertisement for these, like, twelve EDM artists, but they're all great.

53
00:04:32,681 --> 00:04:37,060
Scott: And then their song starts playing, and the level lasts as long as the song is.

54
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,820
Scott: So, if it's a three-minute song, it's a three-minute level.

55
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,618
Rym: You know you're in trouble when Meatloaf starts up.

56
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:48,177
Scott: Well, you gotta survive for three minutes, and if you survive for three minutes, you beat the level, and if you don't, you don't.

57
00:04:48,681 --> 00:04:57,680
Scott: And then, you know, you can collect little bits to get currency to upgrade, so that level becomes easier, and then you can play harder difficulty levels, and try to get the high score on all the different levels.

58
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,639
Rym: I want this kind of game, but just multiplayer versus.

59
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:11,740
Scott: Right, but the thing about this game that is so great, is that because the music controls the shooting, it's like you learn something about EDM, and music in general, just by playing.

60
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,379
Rym: Ahh, I can see that.

61
00:05:14,704 --> 00:05:22,900
Scott: You hear new parts of the song, because you see your ship shooting these little things, and that makes you hear a part of the song you didn't hear before.

62
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:27,140
Scott: It's like a forced synesthesia, if you don't have synesthesia.

63
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:33,159
Rym: There were songs I'd heard that I knew were in DDR, but just because back in the day, I couldn't get DDR games, I'd never danced them before.

64
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:44,620
Rym: And then I remember when I finally danced those songs in DDR, the song sounded so completely different to my brain, because I was paying attention to different stuff, that I went and listened to it again to see if it was my brain or the game.

65
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:49,100
Scott: Right, but this isn't a rhythm game, you don't have to press buttons according to the rhythm, you just move and shoot however you want.

66
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,500
Rym: Your brain's got to think in the rhythm.

67
00:05:50,520 --> 00:06:06,759
Scott: You move and aim however you want, but you know that here comes the drop, and when the drop comes, the laser, it's like big laser, big laser, lots of lasers all over the place, like a disco, and then there'll be a part of the song where it's just like, be quiet yo, and you're not shooting shit.

68
00:06:09,425 --> 00:06:14,539
Scott: And then the bass starts to come back in, and these little buzzes come out the side of your shit, but that's it.

69
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,520
Rym: Alright, I'm playing it, I'm down with this.

70
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:29,319
Scott: And then you're like, oh please, you're dodging, there's homing missiles coming at you, you're just dodging and dodging, hoping that the music will come, waiting for the music to come back, like please please please be a big drop so I can destroy all, you know.

71
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:38,960
Scott: And then once you learn the song, then you know the patterns, and you can sort of pre-aim, like I know this weapon is coming, and you pre-aim where it's gonna come out, right?

72
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,320
Scott: So, if you like feeling the beat, this is a great way to feel the beat.

73
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,240
Rym: Just like Super Hexagon or Shapes and Beats?

74
00:06:48,301 --> 00:06:52,820
Scott: But those are games where you have to react to, it's a little closer to Shapes and Beats.

75
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,079
Scott: It's ten bucks on Steam.

76
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,079
Rym: 'Cause Super Hexagon, the music doesn't really...

77
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:00,640
Scott: To buy the album of these twelve songs would probably cost you ten bucks, right?

78
00:07:01,263 --> 00:07:02,719
Scott: So, not the worst deal.

79
00:07:02,981 --> 00:07:04,287
Rym: I'll play this game, this sounds good.

80
00:07:04,669 --> 00:07:06,699
Rym: I think your assessment of how long I'll play it...

81
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:10,880
Scott: You beat a lot of levels in two days, you know, unless you're obsessed with getting the high score.

82
00:07:11,984 --> 00:07:12,898
Scott: The controls are a little...

83
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,920
Rym: The thing is, I'm more and more a fan of that format game.

84
00:07:15,621 --> 00:07:28,459
Rym: The kinds of games that I like to play nowadays are either the game that ends up being a competitive multiplayer game, or the game that is a succinct experience that doesn't take a ton of time to fully realize.

85
00:07:29,602 --> 00:07:34,600
Scott: I mean, the controls on it aren't perfect, they're a little slippery, it's not like the tightest thing, right?

86
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:41,900
Scott: But it makes you feel the beat, you explore some music, you discover some music, it's a good time.

87
00:07:42,481 --> 00:07:47,100
Scott: If you don't like a twin stick shooter and you don't like EDM, you're not gonna like this game.

88
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:54,200
Scott: But if you like those things, then this is worth your ten bucks and your few hours to unlock all the levels and beat them all.

89
00:07:54,380 --> 00:08:00,222
Rym: So it's getting real close to Rimbai's new computer season, like that bell is ringing, the USB 2...

90
00:08:00,222 --> 00:08:02,300
Scott: I'm actually looking to buy an HDVC because...

91
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,420
Rym: I am too, but not yet.

92
00:08:04,961 --> 00:08:10,540
Scott: We were trying to play some local co-op games the other day, and my HDVC could not handle some of them.

93
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,184
Rym: What do you got in there?

94
00:08:11,204 --> 00:08:13,520
Rym: Because I got a 460 GT or whatever.

95
00:08:13,601 --> 00:08:14,030
Scott: I got an i3.

96
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:15,351
Rym: Yeah, I got an i3.

97
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:19,760
Scott: And the GPU is a low profile, old ass ATI card.

98
00:08:20,503 --> 00:08:22,008
Rym: Oh, I got a 460 at least.

99
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:25,020
Rym: It's low profile and it sucks, but it mostly works.

100
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:30,200
Scott: I'm gonna examine, I measured, my furniture has six inches of vertical space.

101
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:38,820
Scott: So I'm gonna go at PAX and all the mini PCs, especially like Zotac, they're like the kings of tiny PCs, right?

102
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:41,899
Scott: But there's other companies that always have tiny PCs at PAX.

103
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:49,200
Scott: And I'm gonna bring out my little, you know, ruler, and I'm gonna see if I can find a little tiny PC.

104
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:53,840
Scott: All it needs is like a decent video card, like even 800 series is good enough, right?

105
00:08:54,420 --> 00:09:02,380
Scott: And an HDMI output, and an optical audio output, and a bunch of USB ports, and good enough hardware inside of it.

106
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:07,203
Scott: And one SSD, doesn't really matter what size, big enough, 128.

107
00:09:07,203 --> 00:09:12,160
Scott: And if it's less than six inches tall, and it's cheap enough, and it's quiet, then it's a winner.

108
00:09:12,801 --> 00:09:13,951
Scott: I'm sure I can find that.

109
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:14,899
Scott: I'm sure that exists.

110
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,679
Rym: I'll probably, I'll either build another HDPC.

111
00:09:18,501 --> 00:09:20,940
Scott: Even a full size video card isn't six inches tall, right?

112
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,939
Scott: And then you add another inch or two for the case.

113
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,558
Scott: Maybe you take the feet off the case to put it flat on the, you know, whatever.

114
00:09:26,578 --> 00:09:26,900
Scott: I don't know.

115
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:32,880
Rym: See, the problem is, I gotta build a new real PC, because I'm really getting to the end of this thing from 2009.

116
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,900
Rym: But it works 100% fine, other than just being ancient and slow.

117
00:09:38,424 --> 00:09:39,396
Rym: So it would be...

118
00:09:39,721 --> 00:09:40,240
Scott: Give it to somebody.

119
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:45,600
Rym: Or it would be a bitch in HDPC, except I gotta put it in the living room, and this is mid tower.

120
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,260
Scott: You can't get the parts out and put it in a better case?

121
00:09:49,921 --> 00:09:50,263
Rym: Maybe.

122
00:09:50,283 --> 00:09:51,510
Rym: So that's what I'm actually looking at.

123
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,180
Rym: I'm looking at the HDPC cases.

124
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:58,100
Rym: I cannot take the innards of this and put it in my existing HDPC case.

125
00:09:58,382 --> 00:09:59,819
Scott: No, that's a low profile case.

126
00:10:00,223 --> 00:10:02,140
Rym: Only because of the video card.

127
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:02,636
Rym: Yeah.

128
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:03,780
Rym: Everything else would fit fine.

129
00:10:03,964 --> 00:10:04,220
Scott: Exactly.

130
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,171
Rym: So I gotta get a slightly bigger case.

131
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:07,600
Rym: I'm sort of doing my research there.

132
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,100
Rym: But I can hold out a year, I think, so I'll let you get your HDPC on at PAX.

133
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:20,180
Rym: I don't get my main PC on, but it is definitely the time, like now-ish, to buy a new gaming computer if yours is old.

134
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,820
Scott: Yes, because the Nvidia 1080 just came out.

135
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:27,420
Rym: And we've hit this like super fucking long plateau of performance.

136
00:10:27,641 --> 00:10:31,379
Scott: If you get an Nvidia 1080 video card, it might cost a lot of money right now.

137
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:36,360
Scott: But I mean, if you wait six months, it'll still be the top of the line card and still be great.

138
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,315
Scott: Even a 1070 is great, and it doesn't cost a lot of money right now.

139
00:10:39,355 --> 00:10:40,100
Scott: It's average price.

140
00:10:40,761 --> 00:10:45,600
Scott: That will last you five to six years, maybe even seven, eight years if you get one of those.

141
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:54,181
Rym: I mean, in the old days, in the old wisdom, up until the 1080 came out, you would say when the 1080 comes out, buy a super cheap like 970.

142
00:10:54,181 --> 00:11:00,054
Scott: But the 1080s, or the 10 series in general, are just- There's so much, like the difference between a 980 and an 880 isn't really that big.

143
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,771
Scott: The difference between a 1080 and a 980 is like a mile.

144
00:11:03,992 --> 00:11:05,580
Scott: It's like so much faster.

145
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:10,239
Rym: It's like when Intel CPUs went from like the Core 2 Duo to yeah, get an i7.

146
00:11:10,941 --> 00:11:16,700
Scott: It's like Nvidia has these like Titan video cards, which are like the ridiculous ones with four GPUs and they're insane.

147
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:22,040
Scott: For the really rich dumbasses or people who actually are doing CUDA type heavy processing work.

148
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,613
Rym: Of course, at that point, you might get a special card.

149
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,459
Scott: No, I'm just saying they have these Titan cards, right?

150
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:37,860
Scott: The first Titan card that was based on the 900 series is slower significantly than the single GPU 1080 card that you would buy for your gaming computer.

151
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,668
Scott: And there's a new Titan card that has four 1080s.

152
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:42,891
Scott: that's just like, "Fuck you.

153
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:46,098
Scott: I have a thousand, two thousand dollars.

154
00:11:46,118 --> 00:11:46,619
Scott: I don't give a

155
00:11:46,659 --> 00:11:46,880
Scott: fuck.".

156
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:56,080
Rym: Now, even if you don't trust us, because a normal person, like even us who are super into tech, I only build a new computer every like four or so years.

157
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,894
Scott: I'm probably not building a new desktop computer until I can get 1180s or 1280s.

158
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:04,960
Rym: Yeah, especially because your desktop computer is way faster and newer than mine.

159
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,120
Scott: It actually is starting to have a few issues, but it's fine.

160
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,002
Rym: Do you have SATA 6 or SATA 3?

161
00:12:09,002 --> 00:12:11,442
Scott: I don't even know, but I got- I got SATA 3.

162
00:12:11,442 --> 00:12:12,058
Scott: I don't even know.

163
00:12:12,221 --> 00:12:14,100
Rym: Yeah, I got issued my computer's old.

164
00:12:14,781 --> 00:12:19,320
Rym: But the news here is that Nvidia is kind of doubly doubling down.

165
00:12:19,681 --> 00:12:22,276
Rym: They did this with some of the 980s, but they're really doing it with the 1080s.

166
00:12:23,141 --> 00:12:26,180
Rym: There's going to be no more M version of these laptops.

167
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,156
Scott: So instead of having a mobile- Yeah, well, you mean the M GPUs.

168
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:36,740
Rym: Yeah, instead of having a mobile like shit-tier version you can stick in a laptop, they're just putting the same chips in laptops now.

169
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,951
Rym: You can get a GTX 1080 in your laptop.

170
00:12:40,353 --> 00:12:46,360
Scott: that's- An M version, but they're just not calling it M anymore, they're just calling it 1080.

171
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,900
Scott: I think it's actually a different chip.

172
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:56,540
Rym: So let's see, the mobile 1080 is based on the same 16nm Pascal architecture as the GP104 in its desktop counterpart.

173
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:04,879
Rym: Same 2560 CUDA cores, same memory interface, same RAM- But it's still slightly different in some way.

174
00:13:05,982 --> 00:13:11,500
Scott: It's still a mobile version, they're just not calling it M. So it looks like it's just- There has to be some kind of difference.

175
00:13:11,882 --> 00:13:15,640
Rym: To fit in the laptop and has some heat issue, like it has some heat differences.

176
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:24,514
Rym: Although here it is, the concession to mobility comes in, I'm quoting an article, in the form of a drop in the base clock, which runs at 1556 instead of 1607 on the desktop.

177
00:13:27,861 --> 00:13:31,780
Rym: But you can overclock them in the laptop if you're a moron, so I guess there's that.

178
00:13:32,661 --> 00:13:36,520
Rym: It's pretty much the same, like in every regard.

179
00:13:37,181 --> 00:13:40,238
Rym: Though, I'm looking at some screenshots here, and there is one rub.

180
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,550
Rym: Let me find another good screenshot of it.

181
00:13:42,852 --> 00:13:45,060
Rym: Someone took a picture of the power brick- It's a gigantic laptop?

182
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,052
Rym: Oh yeah, it's a gigantic laptop.

183
00:13:47,072 --> 00:13:48,040
Rym: It's not a real laptop.

184
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,860
Rym: I don't even call these laptops anymore because no one puts this motherfucker on their lap.

185
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,540
Scott: It's a desktop with attached monitor that you can put in your bag.

186
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,660
Rym: I would call these, henceforth, portable computers.

187
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:02,379
Scott: But, someone posted a picture- Yeah, you don't put this on your lap.

188
00:14:02,922 --> 00:14:06,820
Rym: Of the power brick that you plug into the back of one of these things?

189
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,320
Scott: I guess you're not running on battery for more than five minutes, right?

190
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:12,720
Rym: It looks like it's almost as big as the PSU in my desktop.

191
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:14,419
Rym: Like, it is gigantic.

192
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,880
Scott: See, that's how they're cheating, right?

193
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:20,837
Scott: It's like if you had to put that power supply in the device, it would be desktop, right?

194
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:28,240
Rym: Well, even my laptop, like all laptops, I've got my 95 watt and my 65 watt power bricks for the outside.

195
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:32,740
Rym: And if I use the 65 watt one, my laptop doesn't perform as well if I'm playing a crazy game.

196
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,820
Rym: That happens now, and I've just got the i7 Intel integrated video nonsense.

197
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:48,900
Rym: So, the moral is, if you're one of those people who goes to conventions or LAN parties or whatever, and brings a gaming laptop, this is basically your lucky day.

198
00:14:49,603 --> 00:14:51,158
Rym: This is good news for you.

199
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:57,180
Rym: And if you're a regular PC gamer, it's still good news because the 1080 is basically, this is the time.

200
00:14:57,502 --> 00:14:59,960
Rym: Unless you already have a 980, it's time to buy a new video card.

201
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:08,690
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

202
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:15,809
Rym: So, this was going to be my thing of the day, but Scott also saw it, and I'm going to defer to him because I have an unrelated thing of the day I can use.

203
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:17,949
Rym: So, you want to share your thing of the day?

204
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:23,230
Scott: Yeah, on my way home, I checked my feeds and I see this video, and it looks like a very New York video.

205
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:27,650
Scott: It occurs on a subway, and I'm about to get on a subway, so I appropriately watch this video.

206
00:15:28,312 --> 00:15:32,850
Scott: And in this video, there's a dude sitting on a train, and he's an older dude.

207
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:36,249
Scott: But despite being older, he's doing something that a high school kid would do.

208
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:43,230
Scott: He's got his backpack on his lap, and behind his backpack, he's got his hand in his pants on his junk.

209
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,235
Rym: Whacking it, whacking it.

210
00:15:44,578 --> 00:15:46,429
Rym: He's whacking it, jacking it, jacking it.

211
00:15:48,231 --> 00:15:54,449
Rym: The YouTube video's title is, and I'm just quoting, "Pervert gets busted rubbing his dick on a New York City

212
00:15:54,489 --> 00:15:54,750
Rym: train.".

213
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:57,057
Scott: Right, so this happens a lot, right?

214
00:15:57,077 --> 00:16:03,220
Scott: I saw a dude once sitting on a stoop on the west side, and he wasn't even trying to hide it.

215
00:16:03,361 --> 00:16:05,270
Scott: It's like, he just had it out.

216
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:07,164
Rym: Like, if you follow the Gothamist...

217
00:16:07,851 --> 00:16:14,930
Scott: He was reclining, he was spread, he was sort of sitting at an angle with his back on the stoop railing, and his legs covering the staircase.

218
00:16:15,051 --> 00:16:16,617
Rym: This is not necessarily a New York thing.

219
00:16:16,657 --> 00:16:19,670
Rym: This happens everywhere in America where there's subways.

220
00:16:20,671 --> 00:16:29,669
Rym: That's just something that, you got enough people, like enough population density, there's a certain percentage of Americans for whom whacking it in public is just a thing.

221
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:38,389
Scott: So, the lady recording this video who uploaded it to YouTube, hero that she is, let him have it.

222
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:39,949
Rym: This video.

223
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:46,490
Scott: Let him have it in a glorious way, and all the comments are pretty much this woman for mayor, this woman for police commissioner.

224
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:47,345
Rym: Yeah, well you know what I want?

225
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:49,550
Scott: I'm not calling the police, I'm calling this woman.

226
00:16:50,231 --> 00:16:53,983
Rym: I want an app that will summon this woman to me instead of the police.

227
00:16:54,544 --> 00:16:56,350
Rym: Holy shit, this woman is amazing.

228
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:06,630
Rym: And I think what's even more amazing about this video is the kid trying to avoid consequences, and trying to even pretend it's not him.

229
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,569
Scott: It's not a kid, it's like a dude.

230
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:10,069
Rym: Yeah, everyone who causes trouble is a kid in my eyes.

231
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:11,865
Rym: He looks like he's in his, what, 20s?

232
00:17:12,371 --> 00:17:13,463
Scott: No, he's like a middle-aged dude.

233
00:17:13,483 --> 00:17:14,089
Scott: What are you talking about?

234
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:14,807
Rym: What, that kid?

235
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:16,148
Scott: Who are you looking at?

236
00:17:16,315 --> 00:17:16,669
Scott: That kid.

237
00:17:17,092 --> 00:17:17,688
Scott: That's not a kid.

238
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,030
Rym: That's a kid, that's like 20s.

239
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,209
Scott: Go towards the end of the video.

240
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:23,729
Rym: He's like in his- That kid is in his mid to late 20s.

241
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,089
Scott: That's an older gentleman.

242
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:26,589
Rym: That is not an older gentleman.

243
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:27,185
Scott: Yes it is.

244
00:17:29,457 --> 00:17:29,750
Rym: That?

245
00:17:30,177 --> 00:17:30,428
Scott: Yes.

246
00:17:30,711 --> 00:17:31,790
Rym: That is not an older gentleman.

247
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:33,710
Scott: Anyway.

248
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:36,945
Rym: I would guess that that person is in their mid to late 20s.

249
00:17:38,412 --> 00:17:40,327
Rym: Now that I'm looking closer, I would say maybe early 30s.

250
00:17:41,155 --> 00:17:41,490
Scott: Anyway.

251
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:42,228
Scott: That's a kid.

252
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,850
Scott: Regardless of the age of this person.

253
00:17:45,456 --> 00:17:46,689
Rym: This person is not older than me.

254
00:17:46,851 --> 00:17:47,788
Scott: In this fuzzy YouTube video.

255
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:52,190
Rym: It's very rare.

256
00:17:52,390 --> 00:18:03,430
Rym: New Yorkers have this very powerful instinct of ignore everything, never respond to anything ever, but occasionally one of us will do something like this and when it happens it's just so glorious.

257
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:14,010
Scott: The only thing that sucks about this video is everyone watching it, all the New Yorkers watching this video are just waiting for the rest of the train to applaud and they don't, so all the other New Yorkers on that train fail.

258
00:18:14,031 --> 00:18:14,114
Scott: Yeah.

259
00:18:14,692 --> 00:18:14,781
Rym: Dude.

260
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,310
Rym: Standing ovation high five is the minimum.

261
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:21,730
Scott: When this lady was halfway through, if I was on that train, I would have been like, "Yeah lady.

262
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:22,529
Scott: You let him have it.

263
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:23,074
Scott: Woo.".

264
00:18:26,751 --> 00:18:33,001
Rym: There's a game that I learned about because a YouTube video is recommended to me and it was a horrible live streamer.

265
00:18:33,021 --> 00:18:33,848
Rym: and I was like, "What the fuck is

266
00:18:33,888 --> 00:18:34,090
Rym: this?".

267
00:18:34,211 --> 00:18:36,269
Rym: And I turned it off and it was bad.

268
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:42,430
Rym: But then I kept seeing the game that the live stream was about all over YouTube.

269
00:18:42,991 --> 00:18:44,749
Rym: I don't know if it's because I clicked on that one or not.

270
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:52,730
Rym: So finally I decided, all right, the internet's decided I got to see this thing, so I watched some more videos and I found a not annoying streamer and I watched a couple of his videos.

271
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:59,390
Rym: This game, which is not out yet, it looks like it just got on Steam Greenlight or whatever, is called Totally Accurate Battle Simulator.

272
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:02,690
Scott: I'm imagining it is not a totally accurate battle simulator.

273
00:19:03,031 --> 00:19:09,650
Scott: I imagine it is a inaccurate battle simulator and it is titled Totally Accurate Battle Simulator because it is sarcastic and funny.

274
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:12,730
Rym: Your assessment of the title of this game is totally accurate.

275
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:18,930
Rym: So you got red dudes and blue dudes with googly eyes and you got a grid on each side.

276
00:19:19,011 --> 00:19:20,129
Scott: Everything's bad with googly eyes.

277
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:26,670
Rym: And you can put dudes ranging from peasants to hwacha or catapult or musket or swordsman.

278
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:28,031
Rym: F-16?

279
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:29,397
Rym: Not yet.

280
00:19:29,994 --> 00:19:30,290
Rym: Not yet.

281
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:33,310
Rym: Musket I think is the most advanced weapon than hwacha.

282
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:34,086
Scott: Nuke?

283
00:19:34,351 --> 00:19:34,689
Rym: And cannon.

284
00:19:36,492 --> 00:19:36,890
Scott: Heron sphere?

285
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:40,369
Rym: So you make your formations on either side and you hit go.

286
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:40,970
Scott: Heron sphere?

287
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,108
Rym: There's a head on a pole behind you.

288
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:44,148
Scott: Head on a pole?

289
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:46,480
Rym: Wizard?

290
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:52,270
Rym: The two armies just have an AI fight and so far that is it.

291
00:19:52,370 --> 00:20:02,130
Rym: The game is in pre-alpha and the people behind this game, it looks like I didn't realize until I started poking around a little more before the show, it's the same people who did Cluster Truck.

292
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:05,284
Scott: I never heard of that, but that's a really obvious name.

293
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:06,350
Scott: I'm surprised no one else took.

294
00:20:08,111 --> 00:20:12,046
Rym: So this game is like super super super alpha, like basically.

295
00:20:12,066 --> 00:20:13,470
Rym: it seems like only YouTube live streamers.

296
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:15,430
Scott: Looks pretty good and not crashy for super alpha.

297
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:18,009
Rym: Like it, the game as it is.

298
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,890
Scott: If I were them I would just do the Minecraft model.

299
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:23,490
Scott: Put it out now, call it beta and then it keeps just getting better over time.

300
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:27,050
Rym: I think they could sell this game now for like ten bucks and make enough money.

301
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:27,810
Scott: That's what Minecraft does.

302
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:33,610
Scott: But you just put it out, you charge ten bucks, it gives you a game for life and then you just keep updating it forever and get more players all the time.

303
00:20:33,831 --> 00:20:39,828
Rym: Yeah, but it actually looks really fun and I watched a bunch of these YouTube videos and I just picked one of them.

304
00:20:40,131 --> 00:20:42,110
Rym: Just watch it, you'll see what the deal is with this game.

305
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,709
Rym: I'm kind of into it, like more so than I thought I would be.

306
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:47,330
Scott: I think it would be fun for like a week or two, but that's about it.

307
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:48,467
Rym: I think, well the thing is...

308
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,810
Scott: They'd have to keep updating it to keep it really fresh.

309
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:54,429
Rym: It's because this is alpha, because I know one of the things they're working on is campaigns.

310
00:20:55,090 --> 00:21:01,014
Rym: Where like, yeah so imagine there's an enemy formation and you've got a limited amount of funds, like.

311
00:21:01,296 --> 00:21:03,589
Rym: can you beat that army with just peasants and poachers?

312
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:05,790
Rym: Like that kind of nonsense.

313
00:21:06,572 --> 00:21:09,190
Rym: I can imagine multiplayer being good, like me versus Scott.

314
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:14,990
Scott: Yeah, you secretly set up a formation, they secretly set up a formation, the formations are revealed and then you fight.

315
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:17,200
Scott: Or there's some sort of scouting.

316
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,729
Scott: that happens, you get limited information, then you make your formation.

317
00:21:20,851 --> 00:21:25,549
Scott: You make part of your formation, you scout, and then you make the rest of your formation and then you fight.

318
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:29,370
Rym: But I think you could have just as much fun playing this game, like Scott said.

319
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:32,436
Rym: Like it's the kind of game you'd bust out occasionally when you have friends over, like a Jackbox game.

320
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,076
Rym: Like, "Hey

321
00:21:34,198 --> 00:21:34,626
Rym: everybody!".

322
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:39,078
Rym: And you put this on the HTPC and it occupies half the people at your party for like four hours.

323
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:49,670
Scott: Another thing is this model really lends itself to multiplayer with more than two players without politics, because you could have a bunch of people all make formations in the same battlefield.

324
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:56,729
Scott: But then you can't like... Me, Rym, and everyone else can't be like, "Everyone aim at Scott Johnson," because the guys are just gonna go where they're gonna go.

325
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,984
Rym: Yeah, if it wasn't clear, you have no control over the game.

326
00:21:59,064 --> 00:21:59,910
Rym: once you hit start.

327
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,590
Rym: The battle is your AI dudes by the other AI dudes.

328
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:05,650
Scott: Sadly, we wouldn't be able to team up on Rym, no matter how much we should.

329
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:13,570
Scott: But likewise, people wouldn't stupidly not attack Rym because their guys would just attack Rym, you know, in the same proportion that they attacked every other guy.

330
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:17,930
Rym: So, in the moment, the book club book that's coming up is Rebecca.

331
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:19,246
Rym: Rebecca.

332
00:22:21,853 --> 00:22:29,170
Rym: So, I realized, as a total aside, that I wasn't sure if I'd seen Rebecca or not, because my mom, when I was really young, made us watch.

333
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:30,769
Scott: Was there a pillow on fire at the end?

334
00:22:31,271 --> 00:22:32,050
Rym: So, here's the problem.

335
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:38,369
Rym: There's another movie that is not good that I conflated it with in my brain, because I also saw it as a little kid.

336
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:43,409
Rym: And I can't extricate the two from each other, but this other movie is really bad.

337
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,990
Scott: Did it end with a pillow on fire?

338
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:46,669
Rym: No, it ends with the house burning down.

339
00:22:47,257 --> 00:22:47,749
Scott: Oh, okay.

340
00:22:48,754 --> 00:22:53,210
Rym: The bad movie that I remember from when I was a young child is called Picture Mommy Dead.

341
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:54,928
Rym: And I found it on YouTube.

342
00:22:56,971 --> 00:22:57,118
Scott: Okay.

343
00:22:58,697 --> 00:22:59,289
Scott: I never heard of that.

344
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,910
Rym: So, then I watched some clips from Rebecca.

345
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:05,730
Rym: I'm pretty sure I saw it as well as a young child, but never as an adult.

346
00:23:06,673 --> 00:23:08,670
Rym: Or even as a sentient human being at this point.

347
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:13,509
Rym: So, I'm going to read the book from the book club before I watch the super famous movie.

348
00:23:14,138 --> 00:23:14,589
Scott: Good luck with that.

349
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:16,109
Rym: It'll be interesting to see what the experience is.

350
00:23:16,392 --> 00:23:18,830
Rym: The previous book club book was Oryx and Crake by Margaret Atwood.

351
00:23:19,678 --> 00:23:20,149
Rym: We did the show.

352
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:20,522
Rym: It's up.

353
00:23:22,171 --> 00:23:29,842
Rym: Our lecture from PAX East 2016, Atari Game Design, is finally on YouTube, fully realized in glorious 4K.

354
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:37,990
Rym: And this was actually a pretty difficult one to edit together, because we were playing Atari games live on stage.

355
00:23:38,652 --> 00:23:40,489
Rym: And we'd recorded this panel a couple of times.

356
00:23:41,091 --> 00:23:47,549
Rym: And this was the only recording of it I had that had all the components required to make a good video, for various reasons.

357
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:49,909
Rym: So, that's it.

358
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,578
Rym: This is actually one of my favorite panels.

359
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:53,430
Rym: we do, because it can be different every time.

360
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:57,850
Rym: It's not literally just the same thing, because we can just pick five different Atari games and we're good to go.

361
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:02,785
Rym: Otherwise, at PAX West, coming up, Saturday, September 3rd, 5

362
00:24:02,785 --> 00:24:03,025
Rym: p.m.,

363
00:24:03,046 --> 00:24:05,610
Rym: Chicken Theater, we're going to be doing The Grind.

364
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:09,770
Rym: Saturday panel means we won't be tired for it, like full energy.

365
00:24:10,271 --> 00:24:12,390
Rym: We're going to go to dinner, like, right after we do the panel.

366
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:13,228
Rym: It's going to be good times.

367
00:24:14,312 --> 00:24:16,570
Rym: We're putting together our game list for what we're bringing to PAX Prime.

368
00:24:16,951 --> 00:24:18,448
Rym: I think this is going to be a real good PAX.

369
00:24:19,351 --> 00:24:20,569
Rym: Like, I'm really feeling this PAX.

370
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:25,686
Rym: In fact, I think I'm feeling it a little too soon, because we've got a couple weeks before we get to fly out to PAX.

371
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:30,369
Rym: Like, I'm excited now at the level I should be.

372
00:24:30,951 --> 00:24:32,609
Scott: I thought PAX was sooner than it was.

373
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:36,610
Scott: So, my PAX, you know, my Pax-o-meter turned on too early.

374
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:38,890
Rym: You turn the dial all the way up, but you can't turn it back down.

375
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:39,669
Scott: Of course not.

376
00:24:40,633 --> 00:24:42,750
Scott: Only a PAX can turn the PAX dial down.

377
00:24:43,012 --> 00:24:45,030
Rym: I think I'm looking forward to all the games we're bringing.

378
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:47,990
Rym: I just want to play Quartermaster General again with that expansion.

379
00:24:48,151 --> 00:24:48,530
Scott: That's a good one.

380
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,169
Rym: Like, I'm feeling that real hard.

381
00:24:52,271 --> 00:24:54,949
Rym: Otherwise, Patreon, t-shirts, all that stuff.

382
00:24:55,954 --> 00:24:56,489
Scott: Not that stuff.

383
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:57,650
Rym: That stuff's real important.

384
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:59,289
Scott: More important stuff I made.

385
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:00,770
Scott: I'm just going for quantity.

386
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:01,205
Scott: Oh, yeah.

387
00:25:01,491 --> 00:25:02,830
Scott: I just made a bunch of YouTube videos.

388
00:25:03,031 --> 00:25:03,910
Scott: I'm going to make more YouTube videos.

389
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,130
Scott: I'm just making crap YouTube videos.

390
00:25:05,211 --> 00:25:05,868
Scott: I don't even care now.

391
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:07,370
Rym: What do you think I'm doing with the Civ 5?

392
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:07,949
Rym: I'm just like, video.

393
00:25:09,135 --> 00:25:09,910
Scott: I'm going for quantity.

394
00:25:10,031 --> 00:25:15,049
Scott: So if you go to my YouTube channel, not Rym's YouTube channel, there's going to be more videos there than before.

395
00:25:15,854 --> 00:25:16,649
Scott: Just squirting them out.

396
00:25:17,131 --> 00:25:19,851
Rym: I'm actually recording a lot of Civ 5.

397
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,309
Scott: About all sorts of random shit too.

398
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:23,890
Scott: Shit that's not on GeekNights because Rym won't talk about it.

399
00:25:24,552 --> 00:25:28,350
Rym: That's what Rym's Rants, like the Patreon show I do, is all the things that you won't talk about on GeekNights.

400
00:25:28,472 --> 00:25:29,007
Scott: My show's free.

401
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:31,990
Rym: My show costs less.

402
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,108
Rym: You could pay a penny a month.

403
00:25:33,351 --> 00:25:34,389
Scott: I'm more entertaining than you.

404
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:35,350
Rym: Just one penny.

405
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:36,189
Scott: And smarter than you.

406
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:37,250
Rym: Just one penny.

407
00:25:37,573 --> 00:25:38,590
Scott: So, my show's better.

408
00:25:41,451 --> 00:25:45,050
Rym: So there was a game on iOS, or I guess like, not iOS.

409
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:45,989
Rym: Yeah, I guess it was iOS.

410
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:46,489
Rym: Yes, on iOS.

411
00:25:46,531 --> 00:25:47,128
Rym: Only iOS.

412
00:25:47,719 --> 00:25:47,910
Rym: Yes.

413
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:48,610
Rym: Which is important.

414
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:49,589
Rym: Called War Bits.

415
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:51,490
Rym: And Scott was trying to convince me to play it.

416
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:56,210
Rym: The only reason I hadn't played it yet is that I don't own any iDevices of any kind.

417
00:25:56,470 --> 00:26:03,990
Scott: So if you don't know, War Bits is basically an Advance Wars clone and the people who made it said as much, and even if they didn't say as much, it's obvious to everyone in the world.

418
00:26:04,297 --> 00:26:04,428
Scott: Yup.

419
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:07,130
Scott: It's an Advance Wars clone and it's a pretty good Advance Wars clone.

420
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:15,550
Scott: It adds a few things, changes a few things, the graphics obviously are way different, but they're still really professional and good looking and the interface is pretty decent.

421
00:26:15,971 --> 00:26:17,109
Scott: It only has a few tiny flaws.

422
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:31,290
Scott: So if you really want to get your Advance Wars on and not use your tiny old, you know, DS or GBA, and instead use your giant iPad or your iPhone or play with people online and stuff like that, get War Bits for four bucks.

423
00:26:31,771 --> 00:26:38,290
Rym: And the game is unlike, say, similar attempts at things that people try to do, War Bits is fully realized.

424
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:40,670
Rym: Like even, you know, atypical of, like, indie games.

425
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,630
Rym: A lot of indie games, like, remember Multiway?

426
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:46,249
Scott: Yeah, this isn't like us saying, "Man, we should clone Advance

427
00:26:46,269 --> 00:26:46,350
Scott: Wars."

428
00:26:46,451 --> 00:26:48,370
Scott: Like, no, they successfully cloned Advance Wars.

429
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:48,916
Scott: Here it is.

430
00:26:49,017 --> 00:26:49,989
Scott: You can play it right now.

431
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,970
Rym: Yes, but that is not the news.

432
00:26:52,352 --> 00:26:53,410
Rym: That's not what we're talking about today.

433
00:26:53,510 --> 00:27:02,986
Rym: What we're talking about is that the people who made War Bits, which it turns out was just two people, posted a post-mortem titled, as far as I can tell, "War Bits was a Dumb

434
00:27:03,107 --> 00:27:03,428
Rym: Idea."

435
00:27:04,796 --> 00:27:06,330
Rym: And Scott sent this to me because he saw it first.

436
00:27:06,931 --> 00:27:08,125
Rym: And I read it, and Scott read it.

437
00:27:08,971 --> 00:27:12,970
Rym: And it's actually a real interesting story of how War Bits got made.

438
00:27:13,951 --> 00:27:16,710
Rym: And I have a lot of thoughts on this article.

439
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:21,290
Rym: So I guess I want to preface all of this by saying that, one, we don't know either of these two people.

440
00:27:21,411 --> 00:27:22,749
Scott: I don't have as many thoughts as Rym is.

441
00:27:22,911 --> 00:27:23,328
Rym: I have a lot.

442
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:45,089
Rym: But all the shit we're about to talk is based solely on having read this article, Scott having played the game a lot more than me, me having played the game a couple of times on someone else's iPad, and us just generally talking shit about how to make games, because while we talk a lot about games, and we've designed or have designed a lot of games, we have not really published any games.

443
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:47,609
Rym: So this is like maximum shit-talking here.

444
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:54,438
Rym: I think Luke Crane was the one who said that the worst thing you can ever say to him in the world is, "You know what you should have done?

445
00:27:54,458 --> 00:27:55,747
Rym: You know what you should

446
00:27:55,787 --> 00:27:55,968
Rym: do.".

447
00:27:56,230 --> 00:28:00,250
Scott: Oh, side note, speaking of Luke Crane, he was at Gen Con, like he does.

448
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:00,668
Scott: Oh, yeah.

449
00:28:00,972 --> 00:28:03,210
Scott: And those Team Covenant guys, they interviewed him.

450
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:20,825
Scott: So on the Team Covenant YouTube channel, there's a 20-minute interview with Luke Crane, and the guy opens up the video, he opens up the interview, basically just following his train of thought, and his first question is, "Luke, why is there a Burning Wheel codex for sale here at Gen Con, and I'm a Kickstarter backer and I haven't received it

451
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:21,006
Scott: yet?".

452
00:28:21,611 --> 00:28:23,205
Scott: And Luke is like, "Hey, Luke is way

453
00:28:23,226 --> 00:28:23,448
Scott: mad.".

454
00:28:26,131 --> 00:28:27,163
Scott: He's like, "Don't you work at

455
00:28:27,204 --> 00:28:27,629
Scott: Kickstarter?".

456
00:28:27,894 --> 00:28:28,506
Scott: He's like, "So

457
00:28:28,526 --> 00:28:28,649
Scott: mad.".

458
00:28:29,451 --> 00:28:30,697
Scott: So it's really great.

459
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:39,190
Scott: Even if you don't care about the rest of the things Luke has to say, he's pretty much just promoting his stuff, like Inheritance, which he said he's going to work on in September.

460
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:40,710
Rym: Guys, Inheritance is so fucking good.

461
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:42,689
Scott: He said he's going to work on it in September in this video.

462
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:44,240
Rym: It is so good.

463
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,550
Scott: There's a forum thread about it right now.

464
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:49,030
Scott: Watch to see him get mad at Wooly from Team Covenant.

465
00:28:49,852 --> 00:28:51,103
Rym: I haven't watched the interview yet.

466
00:28:51,244 --> 00:28:51,829
Rym: I haven't watched it.

467
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:58,008
Rym: So the story behind this article, and you can read it, is that Warbits was made by two people.

468
00:28:59,251 --> 00:29:00,770
Scott: Two people who never met in person.

469
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,785
Rym: Riley and Joe made the game.

470
00:29:02,846 --> 00:29:03,330
Scott: One lived in Texas.

471
00:29:03,652 --> 00:29:06,010
Scott: If you were a person out there, let me just say this right now.

472
00:29:06,171 --> 00:29:08,950
Scott: I don't know how people do this, like never met in person, work together thing.

473
00:29:09,492 --> 00:29:20,249
Scott: If you're a person somewhere who doesn't know how to code, but you want to make arts and do the front end designy part of a game, or anything pretty much, videos or whatever.

474
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:21,050
Scott: Call us.

475
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:22,049
Scott: I can code.

476
00:29:22,874 --> 00:29:25,930
Scott: Even if we've never met, apparently we can make a Warbits, right?

477
00:29:27,113 --> 00:29:29,150
Scott: But you have to be a person who's actually going to do shit.

478
00:29:30,072 --> 00:29:34,169
Scott: Any time in my life when I've ever tried to work with someone, it's always people I've met.

479
00:29:35,252 --> 00:29:39,337
Scott: They just stop replying to email, or don't answer questions, and the thing falls apart.

480
00:29:41,171 --> 00:29:46,210
Rym: Usually that's because we're not working on something that has a timeline, or necessarily structure.

481
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:49,470
Scott: No, there are things that have timelines, and I've worked on them with people.

482
00:29:49,591 --> 00:29:55,570
Scott: And it's like I ask them a question, I literally cannot continue working until they answer my question, and they don't answer, and then the thing fails.

483
00:29:55,670 --> 00:30:09,010
Scott: So if you are a reliable person who will dedicate yourself to a thing, and continue working on it, and communicate consistently, and not stop, then let me know, and we can make a thing along these lines, or other lines.

484
00:30:09,531 --> 00:30:14,630
Rym: In fact, I would make... It's funny, because what these two people did is something that I kind of always wanted to do.

485
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,020
Scott: For four years, they didn't stop.

486
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,009
Scott: Look how good they are, right?

487
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:18,698
Scott: When they started, they had nothing.

488
00:30:18,718 --> 00:30:19,824
Scott: They didn't know how to program.

489
00:30:21,571 --> 00:30:22,960
Rym: Yeah, that is where this gets crazy.

490
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,610
Rym: That is the main reason I want to talk about this.

491
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:25,418
Scott: I know how to program already.

492
00:30:25,439 --> 00:30:26,550
Scott: I've been programming since kindergarten.

493
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:42,830
Rym: They were basically just fans of Advance Wars, who wanted to make Advance Wars exist again, and they started from scratch, having, as far as I can tell, no game design experience, no game design knowledge, no real serious programming experience.

494
00:30:44,071 --> 00:30:46,010
Scott: They just stuck with it for four years.

495
00:30:46,171 --> 00:30:52,230
Rym: Remember way back when we interviewed the creator of Dwarf Fortress, and we realized that, oh, he literally learned how to code to make this game.

496
00:30:53,071 --> 00:30:57,310
Rym: It's the same situation, so it took them... And it's also... This is a very inspirational story.

497
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:07,330
Rym: It took them four years to make this game, but that was four years of working real full-time jobs, and just working on this game as a hobby.

498
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:10,870
Scott: Well, obviously, they worked on it as much as we work on this podcast, right?

499
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:15,167
Scott: They weren't doing much else after work, whatever.

500
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:15,850
Scott: This was their thing.

501
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:20,630
Rym: Yeah, imagine if we put all the effort we put into the last 11 years of GeekNights into anything else.

502
00:31:21,152 --> 00:31:22,069
Scott: We'd be... We have more money.

503
00:31:22,372 --> 00:31:22,440
Rym: Yup.

504
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,649
Scott: We should have put it into something that was monetizable.

505
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:25,850
Rym: So, here's the other amazing thing.

506
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:26,489
Scott: I've been to iOS, I have.

507
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:33,310
Rym: They posted their budget and their costs, because, obviously, the only thing that doesn't include is the fact that they had full-time jobs.

508
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,743
Scott: Well, if you're making an iOS game, you have to have Macs.

509
00:31:35,864 --> 00:31:36,628
Scott: You can't use Macs.

510
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:42,430
Rym: They're total expenses, including an Apple developer license.

511
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:43,870
Scott: Oh, you need that too, yeah.

512
00:31:44,011 --> 00:31:46,570
Scott: And a MacBook Pro, because they needed a Mac.

513
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:48,450
Scott: Wouldn't they need two MacBook Pros for two people?

514
00:31:48,752 --> 00:31:49,601
Rym: They only listed one here.

515
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:52,570
Scott: Maybe one guy did all the programming and one guy did the art.

516
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:53,690
Rym: That seems like that's how it went down.

517
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:56,890
Scott: And the art guy could just use Creative Cloud on a Windows PC.

518
00:31:57,091 --> 00:31:58,625
Rym: We're talking under 15 grand.

519
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:00,169
Scott: Yeah, that's cheap.

520
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:05,050
Rym: And that includes 11 grand worth of hiring freelancers to do the parts that they weren't going to do.

521
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:10,010
Rym: And six grand of that was a backend that they then didn't use.

522
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:11,249
Scott: Oh, wow.

523
00:32:11,491 --> 00:32:14,630
Rym: Yeah, so think about what this means.

524
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:17,470
Scott: That's got to be so sad, spending six grand on something you don't use.

525
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:18,930
Scott: You know what you can get for six grand?

526
00:32:20,294 --> 00:32:20,699
Rym: You know what?

527
00:32:20,719 --> 00:32:21,569
Rym: You know what you can get for...

528
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:23,949
Scott: We could buy so many cameras and shit.

529
00:32:24,231 --> 00:32:25,269
Rym: You know what you can get for 12 grand?

530
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:26,130
Scott: We could buy cars.

531
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:31,230
Rym: For 12 grand, you can get the entire non-salary budget of a game this high quality.

532
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:34,390
Scott: You might be able to get every Steam game for six grand.

533
00:32:34,813 --> 00:32:36,809
Rym: I could finance this game with my credit card.

534
00:32:37,152 --> 00:32:37,647
Scott: Yeah, maybe.

535
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:40,156
Scott: So, think of this.

536
00:32:40,317 --> 00:32:45,490
Rym: Even if we included their salaries, let's assume they made, for real, New York-style money.

537
00:32:45,752 --> 00:32:46,610
Scott: So, two people.

538
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:48,130
Scott: 150 grand a year.

539
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:49,649
Scott: Two people, four years.

540
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:51,207
Scott: So, 300 grand a year times four.

541
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:52,210
Scott: A million dollars.

542
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:55,990
Rym: So, a million dollars for a game like this is not out of the realm.

543
00:32:56,711 --> 00:33:02,270
Rym: But the thing is, if they were already programmers and already had some game design knowledge...

544
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:04,669
Scott: Yeah, it definitely cost more than a million dollars to make Advance Wars, right?

545
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,627
Scott: Because they originally thought, "Oh, this is a six-month

546
00:33:06,668 --> 00:33:06,869
Scott: game."

547
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:09,440
Scott: At any of the Advance Wars games, like the DS1?

548
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,284
Scott: What's the last one?

549
00:33:12,636 --> 00:33:13,170
Rym: Days of Ruin.

550
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:15,150
Scott: Days of Ruin cost way more than a million dollars to make, right?

551
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:18,590
Rym: Partly because they had a huge team, because those campaigns are, like, real well-designed.

552
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:19,490
Scott: Yeah, definitely.

553
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:22,070
Rym: But they originally thought this game would only take six months.

554
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:25,445
Rym: And, honestly, I think that's close to accurate.

555
00:33:25,505 --> 00:33:26,470
Rym: if they were working full-time.

556
00:33:26,711 --> 00:33:29,610
Scott: If they had started with skills, it would have taken six months.

557
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:30,849
Rym: I'm just saying, I'm going to be real blunt.

558
00:33:31,534 --> 00:33:32,150
Scott: For a full-time.

559
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:35,426
Rym: If that were me and Scott working full-time, I think six months is a reasonable time.

560
00:33:36,791 --> 00:33:44,210
Rym: But, to qualify that, I think it would really be six months of game design and then three to six months of programming.

561
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:53,730
Rym: Because they basically made a really, really awesome thing while simultaneously making all the amateur mistakes you'd expect along the way of people who just don't know how to do this.

562
00:33:54,511 --> 00:33:56,689
Rym: So it's a real interesting story to kind of see how it played out.

563
00:33:57,672 --> 00:34:02,230
Rym: It seems like the game only sold a whole bunch because they got lucky and it appeared at the top of the Apple nonsense.

564
00:34:03,073 --> 00:34:04,370
Rym: Like, at a very opportune time.

565
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:12,830
Scott: Well, because if you make a game, really, how professional it looks goes a long way towards how well it's promoted in the App Store.

566
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:16,210
Scott: So this game looks like fucking professional.

567
00:34:16,992 --> 00:34:22,989
Scott: It looks like a top-tier 2D game should look in the year 2016.

568
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:28,850
Scott: And the user interface, while it has some slight flaws, it lets you play Advance Wars really nicely and comfortably.

569
00:34:29,331 --> 00:34:30,943
Scott: And you don't really get mad at it or anything.

570
00:34:31,386 --> 00:34:31,929
Scott: It's super good.

571
00:34:32,091 --> 00:34:32,351
Scott: Yeah.

572
00:34:33,054 --> 00:34:37,389
Rym: But I guess they were sort of building the game as design.

573
00:34:37,911 --> 00:34:40,587
Rym: And I feel like this happens a lot where people think, "Oh, I'm going to make a video

574
00:34:40,607 --> 00:34:40,808
Rym: game."

575
00:34:41,291 --> 00:34:45,650
Rym: And they basically start writing code almost right away and start looking at frameworks and things right away.

576
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,208
Scott: Well, you can make prototypes right away.

577
00:34:47,731 --> 00:35:02,490
Rym: Yeah, but unless you start with, like, sit down with some paper and think about your game mechanics and flesh that out pretty far before you're writing code, I feel like this is a common problem among people who have a good idea for a game but don't have a lot of experience.

578
00:35:03,931 --> 00:35:12,330
Rym: I mean, if I was making a game like this, three to six months of literally pen and paper game design, and that's literally all you're doing for those three to six months.

579
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:13,857
Scott: Well, you know, it depends.

580
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:23,590
Scott: If you know, for example, you're going to make a platformer, you can either get a platforming engine and then code up just the basic stuff, and then you do all your tweaking once you've got code.

581
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:37,090
Rym: I would not be coding that stuff even for a platformer until I had already sketched out in pretty big detail, like, ten examples of, like, the kinds of levels I want and the kinds of mechanics I need in the game to make those levels be the kind of game that I want.

582
00:35:38,191 --> 00:35:38,733
Scott: You could just do it.

583
00:35:38,954 --> 00:35:39,456
Scott: It doesn't matter.

584
00:35:39,476 --> 00:35:40,159
Scott: You can do it after.

585
00:35:40,279 --> 00:35:43,150
Scott: You can just get the plan and then you can see if those mechanics work, right?

586
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:48,488
Scott: You make a tiny little level that has the mechanic you're thinking of and you test that one mechanic and see, "Does this actually

587
00:35:48,529 --> 00:35:48,769
Scott: work?".

588
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:50,910
Rym: But I guess I would want a very clear vision.

589
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:55,250
Scott: You're going to make these grand plans and then we actually get to code and be like, "Ah, half my grand plans I've got to throw

590
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:55,330
Scott: out.".

591
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:59,302
Rym: Not grand plans, just a very clear vision of, like, "Here's an example of a perfect level in this game.

592
00:35:59,342 --> 00:36:00,665
Rym: What do I need to do to achieve that?

593
00:36:01,027 --> 00:36:01,608
Rym: And will that

594
00:36:01,668 --> 00:36:01,889
Rym: work?".

595
00:36:02,311 --> 00:36:03,549
Scott: You've got to do one thing at a time.

596
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:13,750
Rym: So, but if I was going to make this game, like, for real, I think the real differences are, one, already not a code and, like, all that stuff.

597
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:16,638
Rym: But that aside, I wouldn't have made it for iOS.

598
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:22,301
Rym: I feel like the Venn diagram... Uh, a little bit.

599
00:36:22,624 --> 00:36:23,048
Rym: But I'm saying...

600
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:24,222
Scott: That's pretty much it.

601
00:36:24,303 --> 00:36:24,790
Scott: No, 100% sour grape.

602
00:36:25,112 --> 00:36:26,549
Rym: I think the Venn diagram...

603
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:29,170
Scott: Like all these sour grapes, it's grape season, but your grapes are sour.

604
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:32,023
Rym: I just, because you're the one who was like, "Why is this game on Steam?

605
00:36:32,143 --> 00:36:33,449
Rym: I want to play it on a desktop.

606
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:33,590
Rym: Jesus.".

607
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:37,330
Scott: Well, it would be nice to play on desktop too, but yeah, I'm playing on my iPad.

608
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:48,010
Rym: I just feel like the Venn diagram of people who really want a spiritual successor to Advance Wars and people who use Android and Steam overlaps pretty heavily.

609
00:36:48,732 --> 00:36:51,620
Scott: It does, but Advance Wars is traditionally a portable game.

610
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,448
Scott: It's not a sit down in your room game.

611
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:57,929
Scott: That is true, however... It should be on portable devices.

612
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:09,890
Rym: That is true, but if I had to choose, because remember, the demographic you're going after if you make a game like this is either this blue ocean of try to get people who have never encountered a game like Advance Wars before.

613
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:15,490
Rym: There's another angle of go after Fire Emblem type people, like Final Fantasy Tactics type people.

614
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:16,649
Scott: Those are not Advance Wars people.

615
00:37:16,911 --> 00:37:21,270
Rym: Yeah, but you could go after them and bring them into this kind of game, but you have to have a very different aesthetic.

616
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:27,290
Scott: I think the Nintendo audience that played Advance Wars overlaps more with Apple than with Android.

617
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:33,510
Rym: I don't think so, because I think the audience of people who played Advance Wars on Nintendo didn't overlap with people who played a lot of other things on Nintendo.

618
00:37:35,591 --> 00:37:36,124
Scott: I don't know.

619
00:37:36,871 --> 00:37:48,707
Rym: I know I'm just a completely anecdotal BS example, but I think I played more Advance Wars on all my portable Nintendo consoles since the Game Boy Advance onward than any other games combined.

620
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:53,030
Scott: Let's hope they make Advance Wars for the NX, right?

621
00:37:53,551 --> 00:37:57,050
Rym: If they make Advance Wars for the NX and it's a new one, I'll literally buy an NX the day it comes out.

622
00:37:57,131 --> 00:37:58,889
Scott: I think I'm buying NX the day it comes out no matter what.

623
00:37:59,091 --> 00:38:00,190
Rym: Oh good, then I can borrow yours.

624
00:38:00,376 --> 00:38:00,526
Rym: No.

625
00:38:00,931 --> 00:38:01,868
Rym: I'll come over and play it then.

626
00:38:02,911 --> 00:38:05,950
Scott: I think it's going to be portable, from what I hear.

627
00:38:06,311 --> 00:38:15,170
Rym: In terms of this kind of game, like Advance Wars as a game, the mode that most people play is single player campaign, you know, by yourself, commuting or conventions or whatever.

628
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:17,990
Rym: Multiplayer didn't happen that often because you had to be physically in person.

629
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:30,290
Rym: Online multiplayer, particularly Take Your Turn by Mail style multiplayer, I think would be huge in a game that has that level of tactical involvement of a game like Advance Wars.

630
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:35,370
Scott: The thing is that the Take Your Turn by Mail multiplayer makes sense when you have a big Advance Wars.

631
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:37,430
Scott: For a little one, it'd be really frustrating.

632
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,762
Scott: It's like you've got five infantry, really?

633
00:38:39,802 --> 00:38:40,930
Scott: I've got to sit here and wait all day?

634
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:46,630
Rym: Ah, but in Advance Wars, actually the small maps break down and get super degenerate and kind of bullshitty.

635
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:54,850
Rym: And the only maps that are actually good for a long, serious skill game, like once you get good at the game, are the giant maps that take a couple hundred turns to resolve.

636
00:38:55,191 --> 00:38:59,404
Scott: Yeah, I'm just saying, most people play the small maps, right?

637
00:38:59,445 --> 00:39:01,090
Scott: They don't have the attention span for the big map.

638
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:03,270
Rym: But that's it, the real strength of the Advance Wars.

639
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:09,650
Scott: The other problem with the big map is the big map, with the small map, the game ends when someone has won, right?

640
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:11,566
Scott: So you win, and then you win.

641
00:39:11,647 --> 00:39:12,010
Scott: It's over.

642
00:39:12,411 --> 00:39:18,450
Scott: The big map, you get to a point where you've won, but you can't actually capture my HQ or destroy all my units for like another week.

643
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:19,354
Scott: Fuck, uh.

644
00:39:20,361 --> 00:39:20,603
Scott: Right?

645
00:39:20,744 --> 00:39:21,610
Scott: It's that kind of situation.

646
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:28,190
Rym: Yep, but because multiplayer was pretty rare in the old Advance Wars day, like it was rare people could actually play Advance Wars multiplayer with each other.

647
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:39,690
Rym: So the fact that the campaign, like the single player, was so strong and so tight is, I think, what resulted in the majority of the fandom for the Advance Wars series.

648
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:44,970
Rym: And I think part of that was that it wasn't just that the game was slick and polished and had good mechanics and everything.

649
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:59,470
Rym: It was that it edged more into the stuff that people care about in games like Fire Emblem, where you have these strong iconic character designs and this sort of like very overarching dumb anime plot narrative that people seem to get really into.

650
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:02,000
Scott: I do think that's one thing that War Bits is lacking, right?

651
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:04,470
Scott: It doesn't have the characters that Advance Wars has, right?

652
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:06,761
Scott: You wouldn't cosplay as anything in War Bits.

653
00:40:06,841 --> 00:40:08,810
Scott: No one would recognize you if you did or care.

654
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:12,258
Scott: It's pretty much just like red versus blue, generic dudes.

655
00:40:12,278 --> 00:40:13,560
Scott: They're like the same dudes.

656
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:17,208
Scott: You're not specializing in anything, right?

657
00:40:19,811 --> 00:40:25,430
Scott: So it doesn't have that sort of style and you don't get attached to it the way you would get attached to Advance Wars.

658
00:40:26,172 --> 00:40:26,252
Rym: True.

659
00:40:26,272 --> 00:40:29,670
Rym: I think the other issue is if your iOS exclusive doesn't have character.

660
00:40:30,791 --> 00:40:35,450
Rym: It's very hard for people to find your game who are not in that Venn diagram of care about Advance Wars.

661
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:42,346
Rym: Because selling any kind of game on iOS or even Android is basically this like crap shoot of.

662
00:40:42,386 --> 00:40:44,090
Rym: does your game get featured at the right time?

663
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:46,859
Rym: Does a certain kind of media outlet link to you?

664
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:49,450
Rym: It's very hard to actually sell games.

665
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:51,394
Scott: Well, that's the key, right?

666
00:40:52,296 --> 00:40:57,670
Scott: When you put a game in the app store, because the discovery in all the app stores is so garbage, even on Steam, right?

667
00:40:58,091 --> 00:41:05,890
Scott: You have to basically put in lots of effort to do press releases and get someone to write something about you.

668
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,990
Scott: Like you gotta be at every PAX, like in the dealer's room.

669
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:09,872
Scott: You have to push.

670
00:41:10,033 --> 00:41:15,150
Scott: And they pushed War Bits a reasonable, they didn't push it super hard like some games, but they pushed it a reasonable amount.

671
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:22,950
Rym: Well look, if their budget was twelve, thirteen-ish grand, I mean, a game like that, I would put a marketing budget at at least six figures.

672
00:41:23,672 --> 00:41:31,030
Scott: Right, and the other thing is that if you look around, there are some games that aren't that great that push super, super hard.

673
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:33,728
Scott: There are those games we see every PAX, like say Brawlhalla.

674
00:41:34,831 --> 00:41:37,350
Rym: Oh my god, Brawlhalla does not look like a good game.

675
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:39,076
Scott: And it's like there's such a push behind it.

676
00:41:39,176 --> 00:41:41,043
Scott: And when you push that hard, it works.

677
00:41:41,063 --> 00:41:42,869
Scott: There are people who play it and are into it, right?

678
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:47,126
Scott: But if the game doesn't hold, you can only get so far by pushing.

679
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:54,990
Scott: But meanwhile, there's games that are amazing and it doesn't, you know, it takes a lot less pushing to get a good game to go.

680
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:58,940
Scott: Merit still matters more than how you push, but you still gotta push.

681
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,450
Scott: Even if you got a rock that's ready to roll down the hill, it's a big ass rock.

682
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:05,670
Scott: You still gotta like sort of slam into it to get it rolling, right?

683
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:15,430
Rym: Yup, but for some perspective, like to buy a significant, like buy like Google ads, like significant pushes like that and exhibiting it like a bunch of like major game cons.

684
00:42:16,092 --> 00:42:18,027
Rym: You could afford that for like less than 20 grand.

685
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:22,170
Scott: You could afford that with the six grand that they wasted on something they didn't use.

686
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:28,370
Rym: Yup, but that was partly because they started coding and doing the game design at the same time and they were sort of just muddling through the project.

687
00:42:28,811 --> 00:42:32,630
Scott: Well, they didn't have to do much design a lot because they're just copying advanced work.

688
00:42:32,771 --> 00:42:36,050
Rym: Ah, no, because they talk a lot about how it got way more complex than they expected.

689
00:42:36,498 --> 00:42:36,729
Rym: They did.

690
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:39,570
Rym: It sounds like the mechanics were too complex to talk about that.

691
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:48,670
Rym: I suspect, and I don't know because we don't know them, that you get into the situation where like there are people who are fans of a thing, like fans of an anime like Eva.

692
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:55,930
Rym: But they might not necessarily have the film knowledge to understand like specific things that were done in that show that made them like it.

693
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:58,022
Rym: Like the people who liked original Dota.

694
00:42:59,291 --> 00:43:03,910
Scott: Like without the, you know, without the source code of Advance Wars, there isn't like a deconstruction.

695
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:07,370
Scott: So it's like you don't necessarily know like the exact math that's used.

696
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:09,249
Rym: Actually because of game facts, you kind of do.

697
00:43:10,374 --> 00:43:11,703
Scott: Sometimes you do, sometimes you don't.

698
00:43:11,723 --> 00:43:12,790
Scott: Like Pokemon people know.

699
00:43:13,232 --> 00:43:14,821
Scott: They knew about EVs when there was like.

700
00:43:14,861 --> 00:43:16,290
Scott: how did you even figure that out, right?

701
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:23,850
Scott: But, you know, for other games like people still, I don't think people still know how the breeding works in the stupid horse game on the 3DS.

702
00:43:25,131 --> 00:43:29,930
Rym: Yeah, but I do know, like I know the old Advance Wars, like the formulas are pretty well known or at least close enough.

703
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:38,550
Rym: But I feel like some fundamental game design knowledge, you could have deconstructed and then reconstructed the Advance Wars rules pretty quick.

704
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:40,490
Rym: And I suspect that they did a lot more trial and error.

705
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:42,450
Scott: The other thing is that they change some things.

706
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:48,210
Scott: And the thing, Advance Wars is so finely tuned that changing even one thing means you have to change a lot of other things.

707
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:51,970
Scott: So for example, they added a ranged infantry unit, which actually I like a lot.

708
00:43:52,574 --> 00:43:53,279
Scott: It's a great unit.

709
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:54,668
Scott: It's a great thing to have in the game.

710
00:43:55,091 --> 00:43:58,886
Scott: It lets you sort of have artillery, but it's extra vulnerable.

711
00:43:58,946 --> 00:43:59,850
Scott: It's not that strong.

712
00:44:00,291 --> 00:44:01,174
Scott: But it's a good way to like.

713
00:44:01,234 --> 00:44:05,810
Scott: if someone's coming at you with infantries, you can sort of shoot at them without having to lose, you know, your unit.

714
00:44:06,474 --> 00:44:07,850
Scott: And it, you know, it can also capture.

715
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:14,570
Scott: It's like you can send this artillery out there over a mountain and capture something, but also shoot from the top of the mountain to rain death upon infantry.

716
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:17,450
Scott: You know, it's like it's a good, balanced, decent unit.

717
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:25,190
Scott: But adding that, if you just toss that into the existing Advance Wars without changing anything else, it's not going to work.

718
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:39,230
Rym: Because it's very telling that from what I can gather from actual Advance Wars, a huge chunk of the larger than you expect team that made that game was just working on tuning the campaign and tuning like the actual game mechanics to make everything balance.

719
00:44:39,751 --> 00:44:40,742
Scott: Yeah, map making.

720
00:44:40,763 --> 00:44:41,390
Scott: It's tough.

721
00:44:41,691 --> 00:44:41,971
Rym: Yeah.

722
00:44:42,753 --> 00:44:49,910
Rym: And that's also why I think the actually the multiplayer experience, as much as I love playing Advance Wars with humans, I think it does kind of break down if everyone is really good.

723
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:57,190
Rym: And these games really just are best to be thought of as like long campaign puzzling kind of games because otherwise against humans.

724
00:44:58,051 --> 00:44:58,493
Rym: Well, you watch.

725
00:44:58,533 --> 00:45:02,410
Rym: I made a YouTube video a while ago where I played both sides of an Advance Wars fight.

726
00:45:02,972 --> 00:45:06,109
Rym: And let me tell you, shit goes on forever, even on a tiny map.

727
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:19,429
Rym: But I guess like for real props to these guys, because they made a for real legit game in their spare time for not counting their salaries and the hours they spent like under 15 grand.

728
00:45:21,271 --> 00:45:24,123
Rym: And they sold like they made over 100 grand on the game.

729
00:45:24,143 --> 00:45:25,750
Scott: That's pretty good.

730
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:26,170
Scott: Yeah.

731
00:45:26,311 --> 00:45:32,570
Scott: That's I mean, when you hear that number, you're like, whoa, they got like 95, you know, they got tens of thousands of dollars in profits.

732
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:33,132
Scott: That's great.

733
00:45:33,172 --> 00:45:35,759
Scott: But you got to remember four years of work.

734
00:45:36,341 --> 00:45:39,630
Scott: It's like twenty five K a year divided by two people.

735
00:45:39,850 --> 00:45:40,672
Scott: Twelve K a year.

736
00:45:40,732 --> 00:45:41,715
Scott: That is poverty.

737
00:45:42,035 --> 00:45:47,048
Rym: So I guess the real moral is if there's a game that you want to get made, good thing.

738
00:45:47,068 --> 00:45:48,050
Scott: they didn't quit their day jobs.

739
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:48,491
Scott: Yes.

740
00:45:49,475 --> 00:45:51,966
Rym: Make it as a hobby or be rich and just say right.

741
00:45:51,986 --> 00:45:52,809
Scott: But at the same time.

742
00:45:52,869 --> 00:45:53,010
Scott: Right.

743
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:56,297
Scott: So if you didn't quit your day job, you have the amount of money that you have.

744
00:45:56,678 --> 00:46:02,510
Scott: And then, you know, suddenly imagine if both of us just got like 30 K like instantly like an instant infusion.

745
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:05,797
Scott: It's like, oh, on top of my day job, it's like it's crazy good.

746
00:46:06,278 --> 00:46:06,519
Rym: Yeah.

747
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:11,510
Scott: I can go and buy like a car like a Mercedes and not even give a shit because I just, you know,

748
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:23,450
Rym: I feel like at this point, start a little company, hire these guys, give have like a senior developer to actually work with them and like sort of, you know, make sure everything's done with modern best practices, whatever.

749
00:46:24,052 --> 00:46:26,519
Rym: And maybe like a game design on your credit card.

750
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:30,150
Rym: And then I couldn't pay their salaries.

751
00:46:32,971 --> 00:46:45,770
Rym: But you could you could probably take these this team and this game and remake it for a wider release, like on steam and everything and do pretty well for yourself because this niche is still like barely address.

752
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:46,090
Scott: Yeah.

753
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:52,870
Scott: I mean, that's something you could do is actually is these guys could just hire use that money they just got and hire someone to just port their game.

754
00:46:53,571 --> 00:46:55,154
Scott: As like a reinvestment of the profits.

755
00:46:55,775 --> 00:47:03,550
Scott: If you just hire someone to directly port the game to steam and Android and you would make back the money you paid the porter to do the recoding.

756
00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:14,270
Rym: I don't know if Android I might just go with steam probably because actually when I when I set up an emulator to make those advanced wars videos a while ago, I forgot how fun advanced wars was.

757
00:47:14,491 --> 00:47:19,408
Rym: And I just started playing advanced wars on my desktop for a while and it was way more pleasant than playing it on my 3DS.

758
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:28,516
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

759

774

Rym: And now I leave you with something great.

775
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:43,480
Scott: [MUSIC].
