1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,802
Rym: It's Monday August 22nd 2016.

2
00:00:12,802 --> 00:00:13,243
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,283 --> 00:00:21,235
Rym: He's Scott and this is GeekNights tonight and tells new KP like architecture and adblock Wars and a bunch of meat.

4
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:24,418
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:27,112 --> 00:00:37,783
Rym: So I actually was looking at of all things because I've been biking to work again And the weather is like perfect for biking now, and I if I got caught in that rainstorm biking yesterday I dodged that rainstorm not yesterday.

6
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:39,030
Rym: I didn't get rain on Saturday.

7
00:00:39,151 --> 00:00:41,506
Rym: I was on the west side with Emily.

8
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,321
Scott: Saturday I avoided getting rained on.

9
00:00:43,381 --> 00:00:44,450
Scott: I was biking and I saw there.

10
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:50,209
Scott: I knew the rain was coming so it was time to go home and then as I was coming home I saw the rain moving around in the distance.

11
00:00:50,411 --> 00:00:52,138
Scott: We saw the rain coming and I went over.

12
00:00:52,158 --> 00:00:54,790
Scott: I was getting towards Queens and things were looking wet.

13
00:00:54,891 --> 00:00:56,097
Scott: All the streets are crazy wet.

14
00:00:56,117 --> 00:00:58,590
Scott: They're big puddles everywhere, but it wasn't raining.

15
00:00:59,012 --> 00:01:03,530
Scott: We just said and I managed to get home without getting wet and we kept biking.

16
00:01:03,831 --> 00:01:06,966
Rym: So we biked through the rain and then the rain lit up.

17
00:01:06,986 --> 00:01:07,870
Rym: We're like, alright, that was fun.

18
00:01:08,311 --> 00:01:09,816
Rym: And then we're like, well, we're wet now.

19
00:01:09,876 --> 00:01:14,270
Rym: So let's just go home and then the crazy rain came out of nowhere.

20
00:01:14,891 --> 00:01:16,241
Rym: So we just we're done.

21
00:01:16,262 --> 00:01:17,350
Rym: We're on our way home.

22
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,630
Rym: Anyway, so we biked over the like went all the way home over the bridge and everything.

23
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:25,150
Rym: It was raining so hard that on the bridge you didn't slip and fall.

24
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:27,990
Rym: No, cuz I got a good bike and good tires and I got know what I'm doing.

25
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:39,203
Rym: But uh, well if I didn't fall it does some slippery shit though, you know Good tires good technique Even even pro people fall down Yeah occasionally But again at the same time my tires are not.

26
00:01:39,264 --> 00:01:41,732
Rym: my tires are sort of designed for Like.

27
00:01:41,752 --> 00:01:46,984
Rym: they're not as efficient as like a pro racer tire would be because I like to be comfortable and I like to not fall over.

28
00:01:48,273 --> 00:01:55,430
Rym: So going up the bridge There's all those downspouts that are inside the bike lane for when it rains because usually they're on people biking over there.

29
00:01:55,852 --> 00:01:59,069
Rym: Water was just spraying out of them like fire hoses all the way up the bridge.

30
00:02:00,273 --> 00:02:08,695
Rym: it's good times, but I Noticed this morning as I was biking to work that my left my front brake cable Has a few.

31
00:02:08,775 --> 00:02:10,585
Rym: a few of the threads have snapped internally.

32
00:02:10,604 --> 00:02:11,409
Rym: I can feel it in there.

33
00:02:11,792 --> 00:02:21,679
Rym: so it's time to get those replaced and I went and updated my bike maintenance log as I keep track of what maintenance I do and I Gathered some slightly interesting statistics while I was at work over lunch.

34
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:27,075
Rym: Okay, I realized that I replaced my bike brake pads Front and rear.

35
00:02:27,155 --> 00:02:32,955
Rym: I was replacing at the same time every three years tops See my the blood.

36
00:02:32,975 --> 00:02:36,226
Rym: the bike I got in the pads just like the pads.

37
00:02:36,267 --> 00:02:39,435
Scott: the bike I got in 2010. it's now 2016.

38
00:02:39,435 --> 00:02:40,478
Scott: Yep.

39
00:02:40,839 --> 00:02:45,057
Scott: I replaced the pads once ever and they're still fine now.

40
00:02:45,118 --> 00:02:52,465
Rym: my cables I replace a Little over twice a year, but just the brake cables.

41
00:02:52,545 --> 00:02:53,830
Scott: the cables twice a year.

42
00:02:54,191 --> 00:02:56,038
Scott: Yeah, I've replaced the cables never.

43
00:02:56,118 --> 00:02:59,370
Rym: the reason I replace them invariably is I snap them.

44
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:04,610
Rym: Okay, so I was digging around to my other stuff now my other cables like my shifter cables.

45
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,218
Scott: It sounds like they're probably too tight.

46
00:03:07,003 --> 00:03:09,571
Rym: Uh, no, I think Ones.

47
00:03:09,933 --> 00:03:11,017
Scott: no, I've never.

48
00:03:11,077 --> 00:03:14,610
Scott: I've never broken a shifting or braking cable.

49
00:03:14,891 --> 00:03:22,650
Rym: but I was looking through some note like email emails I had and receipts from older stuff and I pretty much never wear out my brake pads.

50
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:23,494
Rym: It's just the cables.

51
00:03:23,895 --> 00:03:29,180
Rym: and I was thinking about my biking style, especially in the old days But I think I just carried over from mountain biking.

52
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:43,452
Rym: I very rarely will shed speed Slow like I'll never shed speed by like bleeding my brakes along the way I'll pretty much be going real fast and then I'll shed my speed all at once if I'm forced to so hard braking Rarely,

53
00:03:43,653 --> 00:03:45,403
Scott: that's pretty much how you drive a car.

54
00:03:45,484 --> 00:03:47,954
Scott: Also a bad way Like that.

55
00:03:48,055 --> 00:03:53,141
Scott: Listen, like racing someone who do something dumb you get rid you go You you hit the brake way too late and way too hard.

56
00:03:53,281 --> 00:03:54,045
Rym: pretty much almost always.

57
00:03:54,105 --> 00:03:54,950
Rym: engine brake in my car.

58
00:03:55,411 --> 00:03:56,395
Scott: Yeah, also bad.

59
00:03:57,098 --> 00:04:09,741
Scott: why when I when I ride a vehicle I break smoothly and well in advance and go You're stopping it's just gliding and Decelerating and then you're stopped.

60
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:10,506
Rym: Yeah, you stop.

61
00:04:11,271 --> 00:04:17,197
Rym: The only time I don't do that is when I'm driving in New York when everything's stop and go nonsense Even in the stop and go nonsense.

62
00:04:17,719 --> 00:04:18,101
Scott: I will go.

63
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,285
Rym: Yeah, I do.

64
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:20,730
Rym: I would like to ride in a car with you.

65
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,349
Rym: Then I just let's say you even drove in New York.

66
00:04:25,371 --> 00:04:33,969
Rym: next time we're gonna drive to a con or something you rent the car instead of me and you can drive and I will sit In the back and I will very well just quietly and politely critique how?

67
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,721
Rym: Rapidly you are braking and accelerating.

68
00:04:36,741 --> 00:04:37,264
Rym: Mm-hmm.

69
00:04:37,586 --> 00:04:38,330
Rym: We'll see how that goes.

70
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,153
Rym: We all even do a video.

71
00:04:39,193 --> 00:04:43,610
Rym: live stream live stream drive like that video probably just be mad that I'm going slow.

72
00:04:45,311 --> 00:04:46,136
Rym: Thing is it's New York.

73
00:04:46,176 --> 00:04:47,685
Rym: I can't ever complain about someone going slow.

74
00:04:47,725 --> 00:04:48,570
Rym: It's just gonna go slow.

75
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:49,738
Scott: It's you are even on the highway.

76
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,658
Scott: I'll be going slow and you'll be like, yeah Why would you go slow on the highway?

77
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:56,423
Rym: you go as fast as you can Because I go smoothly and safely.

78
00:04:56,564 --> 00:04:57,550
Scott: are the top two prior?

79
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,850
Rym: Well, no you go fast as you can when it's a straight line.

80
00:05:00,212 --> 00:05:02,787
Scott: Lastly is the third priority that?

81
00:05:02,828 --> 00:05:06,900
Rym: well, yeah But I'm talking like on the Garden State like down to Wildwood.

82
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:10,329
Rym: just go like 80 cruise control and that's just it.

83
00:05:11,694 --> 00:05:12,489
Scott: No, why?

84
00:05:13,792 --> 00:05:14,133
Scott: Why not?

85
00:05:14,153 --> 00:05:15,838
Scott: that's not how I do but there's.

86
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:18,044
Rym: it's not like there's traffic just going 80.

87
00:05:18,044 --> 00:05:20,311
Rym: Yeah, so you don't go 80.

88
00:05:20,311 --> 00:05:22,058
Rym: No, you're gonna be that guy in the right lane.

89
00:05:22,098 --> 00:05:23,383
Rym: Everyone's passing you going slow.

90
00:05:23,403 --> 00:05:24,085
Scott: That's right.

91
00:05:24,386 --> 00:05:27,757
Scott: All right old man I got my two priorities of safely and smoothly.

92
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:31,387
Rym: I would say that going the speed of traffic is safely.

93
00:05:31,407 --> 00:05:37,830
Rym: Mm-hmm In fact, I would say that it's very much less safe to be the person who's going slower than everybody else in the right lane.

94
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,000
Scott: Uh-huh says he who skis.

95
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:45,283
Rym: Yeah In fact, so also it's time to buy new skis.

96
00:05:45,383 --> 00:05:57,230
Rym: a lot of you might think that you know in the old days There was always this conventional wisdom with specialized equipment time To make excuses to buy things like Scott who just bought a new bike when your old bike is perfectly fine.

97
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,676
Scott: I didn't need an excuse to buy that.

98
00:05:59,319 --> 00:05:59,620
Rym: All right.

99
00:05:59,661 --> 00:06:01,790
Rym: Well, but so why did you buy a new bike?

100
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:03,035
Scott: It was $800 off.

101
00:06:03,336 --> 00:06:04,903
Rym: Yeah, you know, I'm buying new skis.

102
00:06:05,104 --> 00:06:05,446
Rym: There's $600 off.

103
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:11,206
Rym: It's the season to buy last year's new stuff that no one bought at like half off.

104
00:06:11,347 --> 00:06:11,587
Rym: Mm-hmm.

105
00:06:12,591 --> 00:06:25,783
Rym: So buy new skis because the skis I wanted are literally like 48% off right now and I did a little bit of research and Every all the reviews seem to agree that these skis are what Rym wants.

106
00:06:26,104 --> 00:06:33,430
Rym: to get better skis would be to spend Stupid amounts of money and to get shittier skis would be not saving enough money to be worth getting shittier skis.

107
00:06:34,012 --> 00:06:34,815
Rym: So I'm pretty much buying them.

108
00:06:34,835 --> 00:06:37,787
Rym: They're basically just like the modern better version of the skis.

109
00:06:37,807 --> 00:06:47,165
Rym: I got now slightly shorter because I The style of like super long skis is not what I do and not what really anyone needs to do anymore.

110
00:06:47,185 --> 00:06:55,490
Rym: and even better The same kind of skis but like couple steps down right like in Emily's wheelhouse because she's just getting into black diamonds right now.

111
00:06:56,311 --> 00:06:57,540
Rym: Also super discount.

112
00:06:57,822 --> 00:06:59,010
Rym: I think it's time to buy skis.

113
00:07:00,512 --> 00:07:01,295
Scott: No, it's not gonna snow.

114
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:02,481
Scott: So good luck with that.

115
00:07:02,983 --> 00:07:04,530
Rym: Last year was the El Nino year.

116
00:07:04,611 --> 00:07:09,095
Rym: This year's gonna be like normal snow weather probably Global warming and I can ski anywhere.

117
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:13,570
Rym: Ah climate change tends to cause more extreme weather not necessarily just warmer rather.

118
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:16,780
Rym: So in our area, I'm likely to get more snow this year.

119
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,382
Rym: Mm-hmm.

120
00:07:17,623 --> 00:07:18,025
Scott: We'll see.

121
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,590
Scott: eventually it's gonna be 80 all year.

122
00:07:19,812 --> 00:07:26,449
Rym: Well, yeah when it gets to that point I'll probably flee because New York is flooded and we're fucked anyway, and I gotta go somewhere way flooded on the third floor by me.

123
00:07:27,212 --> 00:07:31,084
Rym: Yeah, what are you gonna be going to work through the canals in Manhattan like Venice?

124
00:07:31,506 --> 00:07:32,810
Scott: Yeah, I have a bike powered boat.

125
00:07:34,194 --> 00:07:34,375
Rym: Those.

126
00:07:34,436 --> 00:07:40,903
Rym: have you ever ridden one of those things they go So much like for the amount of pedal compared to how fast you go.

127
00:07:41,304 --> 00:07:43,270
Rym: They are the worst possible thing.

128
00:07:43,831 --> 00:07:45,636
Scott: That's because those are right.

129
00:07:45,657 --> 00:07:50,370
Scott: You could make a boat that was powered by pedaling like a bicycle but didn't go slow.

130
00:07:50,538 --> 00:07:51,432
Rym: Oh, yeah There they exist.

131
00:07:51,553 --> 00:07:56,650
Scott: those the ones that you happen to rent at like a vacation place or a little lake just happen to be go.

132
00:07:56,831 --> 00:07:57,115
Rym: They exist.

133
00:07:57,135 --> 00:07:57,601
Rym: you ever see him.

134
00:07:57,621 --> 00:07:58,250
Rym: They're a kayak.

135
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:05,510
Rym: They look like a kayak, but once you get going they rise up out of the water And they're on just like one little wing-a-ling.

136
00:08:06,211 --> 00:08:17,690
Scott: I mean, I'm sure you could even just do a thing where there's like a flywheel and you use you pedal to just get You know energy into it and then put it into a normal motor like the kind of powerboat has with a little propeller.

137
00:08:18,992 --> 00:08:20,663
Rym: I'll show you a video or I'll link to a video.

138
00:08:20,683 --> 00:08:22,274
Rym: I'll find a video one of those things I'm just saying.

139
00:08:22,334 --> 00:08:28,910
Rym: there are many mechanisms that can be done But it's basically a kayak with a little wing-a-ling and you fly out of the water and it's cool and that's what you want.

140
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:33,927
Rym: But even then I think a bicycle on asphalt is gonna be way more efficient.

141
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:34,789
Rym: It's just my guess.

142
00:08:35,211 --> 00:08:35,994
Scott: Nothing is nothing.

143
00:08:36,195 --> 00:08:40,010
Scott: No mode of transportation that's ever been invented is better than a bicycle in terms of efficiency.

144
00:08:41,111 --> 00:08:42,561
Rym: That's probably true, but I don't.

145
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:45,494
Rym: I'm not sure and I can't back that up But I could see that being plausible.

146
00:08:45,715 --> 00:08:50,126
Scott: the bicycle is the most efficient form of transportation ever actually created by human beings.

147
00:08:51,009 --> 00:08:52,714
Rym: Ah Say it depends.

148
00:08:52,795 --> 00:08:53,457
Rym: What do you?

149
00:08:53,497 --> 00:08:55,444
Scott: and it's also more efficient than any animal.

150
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,030
Rym: What do you mean by more efficient?

151
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:02,548
Scott: Energy you put in to make it go versus how much you go.

152
00:09:03,413 --> 00:09:04,638
Rym: But what do you mean about how much you go?

153
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:05,401
Rym: What if I make something?

154
00:09:05,442 --> 00:09:06,426
Scott: how fast and how far?

155
00:09:06,466 --> 00:09:07,290
Rym: what if I make something?

156
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:11,668
Rym: That weighs an ounce has a payload of another ounce and is super efficient.

157
00:09:11,688 --> 00:09:12,109
Rym: Does that win?

158
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,433
Scott: How it has to go.

159
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:17,023
Scott: as to carry, you know carry a lot.

160
00:09:17,043 --> 00:09:17,585
Rym: That's what I'm saying.

161
00:09:17,605 --> 00:09:18,929
Rym: What's your metric for going?

162
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,144
Scott: has to go.

163
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:22,692
Scott: You're one.

164
00:09:22,712 --> 00:09:24,457
Scott: you're one like I have a grain of salt.

165
00:09:24,518 --> 00:09:25,541
Scott: It gets carried in the wind.

166
00:09:25,601 --> 00:09:26,404
Scott: It's like.

167
00:09:26,564 --> 00:09:27,527
Rym: that's super efficient.

168
00:09:27,949 --> 00:09:32,622
Scott: It's like It's not a. it's not a transportation mechanisms.

169
00:09:32,642 --> 00:09:34,430
Rym: You got any news here on this Monday gig nights.

170
00:09:35,692 --> 00:09:43,763
Scott: I mean we talked about this all the time, but I guess you know It's a. it's a battle that we've always been involved in and it's raging yet again.

171
00:09:43,864 --> 00:09:45,870
Scott: So we might as well continue to rage.

172
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:50,428
Scott: I don't think we talked about it last time at two weeks ago.

173
00:09:50,448 --> 00:09:56,710
Scott: So Facebook has decided to start the next battle in the war on ad blocking.

174
00:09:57,993 --> 00:09:59,177
Rym: Well, there was a there.

175
00:09:59,217 --> 00:10:02,650
Rym: there were multiple salvos in rapid succession on this one, right?

176
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,434
Scott: It seems like we're winning.

177
00:10:03,454 --> 00:10:05,968
Scott: But anyway, so what Facebook was basically like, alright, here's what we're gonna do?

178
00:10:06,671 --> 00:10:10,625
Scott: We are going to stop ad blockers from blocking ads in your Facebook feed.

179
00:10:10,645 --> 00:10:18,130
Scott: So what they tried to do is Make ads in the Facebook feed look a lot like posts in the Facebook feed to confuse the ad blockers.

180
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:24,385
Scott: So the ad blockers updated their shit like real quick Yep, and then Facebook shifted again, and I think the ad blockers shifted again.

181
00:10:24,425 --> 00:10:35,136
Scott: and the main reason that Facebook cannot win this battle is because at least in the United States, there's actually a law that's actually Surprisingly well enforced really?

182
00:10:35,156 --> 00:10:35,678
Scott: Yeah.

183
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:36,481
Rym: What's this law?

184
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:37,745
Rym: This is a twist on this.

185
00:10:37,785 --> 00:10:38,888
Rym: I didn't know about.

186
00:10:38,909 --> 00:10:39,370
Scott: I forgot.

187
00:10:39,451 --> 00:10:41,225
Scott: I forgot the name of it, but I'll get it for you.

188
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:41,446
Rym: Sure.

189
00:10:41,467 --> 00:10:41,870
Rym: It's real.

190
00:10:42,202 --> 00:10:43,877
Scott: Yes I read about it in like three places.

191
00:10:43,917 --> 00:10:47,275
Scott: when I because I it was like a week ago that I read because I got nothing On this.

192
00:10:47,295 --> 00:10:47,883
Rym: this is all you.

193
00:10:47,924 --> 00:10:48,370
Rym: I got nothing.

194
00:10:49,071 --> 00:10:52,342
Scott: You can't just like have ads in the feed that don't say their ads.

195
00:10:52,382 --> 00:10:54,610
Scott: you can't just like put a post in there.

196
00:10:56,091 --> 00:10:59,467
Scott: So if there's like like it has to have the word like like.

197
00:10:59,487 --> 00:11:04,268
Scott: they're putting the word Sponsored there or like, you know, Google separates the ads from the listings.

198
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:09,307
Scott: Yep It's like they can't not do that because at least the United States you'll get in trouble if you don't.

199
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:11,789
Scott: if you do that Ah, it's so beautiful.

200
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:26,027
Scott: Basically, it's like yeah as long as they have to make the ads not exactly a hundred percent identical to the not ads and as long We can find it's like you can write code just like if you see the word sponsored.

201
00:11:26,087 --> 00:11:28,514
Rym: block the whole thing Ah, but there's a second component to this.

202
00:11:28,775 --> 00:11:37,562
Rym: because Facebook has to work in a web browser as a web page and not a proprietary Application we can render it over the fuck we want.

203
00:11:37,743 --> 00:11:40,854
Scott: Well, yeah, we know that's that's the original news But the two things together.

204
00:11:41,015 --> 00:11:47,020
Scott: the other thing is that Facebook right the way that they tried to you know Make mix the ads in with the content.

205
00:11:47,723 --> 00:11:49,049
Scott: They didn't count on this.

206
00:11:49,814 --> 00:11:56,988
Scott: They did not count that the ad blocking people Would be willing to block content along with the ads.

207
00:11:57,169 --> 00:12:01,490
Scott: now See, it's like the like the way they blocked some of the Facebook ads.

208
00:12:01,831 --> 00:12:06,410
Scott: They also ended up eliminating legit things from the feed with this blocking mechanism.

209
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:10,710
Rym: I'm gonna back up and go to a completely different place in case and Facebook was like Facebook was like.

210
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:16,410
Scott: Hey you ad blockers are ruining the people's feeds with their ad blocking and they're pretty much like we don't give a shit.

211
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:20,716
Scott: We'd rather not see as low Who sells ads.

212
00:12:21,137 --> 00:12:24,530
Rym: look upon my field of fucks and see that it is barren.

213
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:25,397
Scott: It's like I'd rather have.

214
00:12:25,497 --> 00:12:27,752
Scott: no I'd like if you if there was a way All right, like.

215
00:12:27,772 --> 00:12:32,110
Scott: it's like if I had to block half the tweets in my Twitter feeds in order to get rid of the ads.

216
00:12:32,331 --> 00:12:33,760
Rym: But I would good luck.

217
00:12:33,801 --> 00:12:34,183
Rym: Have fun.

218
00:12:34,304 --> 00:12:34,626
Rym: Awesome.

219
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:35,129
Scott: All right.

220
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:40,111
Rym: Well to back up a bit remember the early in the earliest days of email spam wasn't a thing Like.

221
00:12:40,151 --> 00:12:41,959
Rym: I remember when I got spam.

222
00:12:41,999 --> 00:12:46,842
Rym: like a spam email came into my account at RIT Delete button and I saw it in Elm.

223
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,230
Rym: I didn't push the delete button.

224
00:12:48,551 --> 00:12:54,968
Rym: I forward it to the abuse at RIT dot edu and they would look into like blocking it.

225
00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:59,583
Rym: for me That is how different the internet was not that long ago.

226
00:12:59,603 --> 00:13:01,650
Scott: I was telnet it into a server.

227
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:02,152
Scott: You don't know.

228
00:13:02,192 --> 00:13:03,898
Scott: that was really long ago, by the way, uh 16 14 14 years ago.

229
00:13:03,918 --> 00:13:09,397
Rym: That's a long time ago Yeah, but it's also not that long ago.

230
00:13:09,417 --> 00:13:11,485
Scott: a kid who was born then be 14 right now.

231
00:13:11,745 --> 00:13:22,182
Rym: Yeah, so In the when Gmail added spam blocking the earliest problem that was noticed was that a lot of you know A lot of spam blockers would block.

232
00:13:22,242 --> 00:13:47,061
Rym: you had two ways to go either Never get false positives But as a result a lot of spam got through or you'd tune it more and more and you'd risk missing an email you wanted To see but in return you block a higher percentage of the spam and what everyone realized very early in the email spam blocking wars Was that pretty much everyone would be willing to miss like 90% of their emails rather than see a single spam

233
00:13:47,162 --> 00:13:47,563
Scott: pretty much

234
00:13:48,306 --> 00:13:49,330
Rym: and adds it the same way.

235
00:13:49,431 --> 00:13:51,010
Rym: I remember when I used to use host files.

236
00:13:51,312 --> 00:14:03,770
Rym: There was an anime site I used to go to and one day they had this giant horrible animated banner ad over the whole site and I was like well and I added it to my host file and Then the entire site didn't render anymore.

237
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:09,553
Rym: It was basically like just text on a white screen and I was like actually this is better I think.

238
00:14:09,613 --> 00:14:10,939
Scott: imagine this you got a TV show.

239
00:14:10,979 --> 00:14:12,707
Scott: The TV show is 20 minutes long.

240
00:14:12,928 --> 00:14:14,910
Scott: Yeah It's an episode of adventure time.

241
00:14:15,732 --> 00:14:27,147
Scott: you can either watch this episode of adventure time and one commercial that is 60 seconds long or You can watch this episode of adventure time and miss one minute of the episode of adventure time.

242
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:35,890
Scott: at that point I would choose the third option of I just pirate the adventure time entire saying if those are your only two choices You're probably missing the one minute of adventure time.

243
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:38,569
Scott: You don't have to watch some like ad for something about the old VHS days.

244
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:43,290
Rym: Remember as a kid my one of the chores of my family was someone had to be the manual ad block for the family.

245
00:14:43,595 --> 00:14:46,929
Rym: so Simpsons Cosby show all the stuff that we watch.

246
00:14:47,812 --> 00:14:48,837
Rym: Yeah, we watch The Cosby Show.

247
00:14:48,897 --> 00:14:50,505
Scott: We did not watch The Cosby Show.

248
00:14:50,546 --> 00:14:51,330
Rym: I watched a lot.

249
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,375
Rym: We like we were like with.

250
00:14:52,395 --> 00:14:54,426
Rym: there were certain shows that we would watch as a family.

251
00:14:54,547 --> 00:14:56,272
Scott: We watched The nanny.

252
00:14:56,914 --> 00:14:58,278
Scott: Whoa, and we watched.

253
00:14:58,419 --> 00:15:00,385
Rym: well, we didn't watch the nanny and we watched.

254
00:15:00,425 --> 00:15:01,027
Rym: I watched mr.

255
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,990
Rym: Belvedere The Fresh Prince of Bel Air.

256
00:15:05,712 --> 00:15:09,603
Rym: We watched both elf and we fucking watched small wonder.

257
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:17,310
Rym: we did not watch small wonder small wonder But one of the chores the family was someone had to sit there and record the shows that we're all gonna watch.

258
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:22,515
Rym: we never watched him live and they would pause the recording whenever the commercials came on and Unpause it.

259
00:15:22,999 --> 00:15:28,345
Rym: and because you know the person doing it It was like taking off the garbage like ah, I gotta block the ads this week mom.

260
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:29,550
Rym: I don't wanna.

261
00:15:30,252 --> 00:15:32,580
Rym: So sometimes I'd miss like I wouldn't notice.

262
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,830
Rym: the show came on and I'd miss like the first five minutes of the episode.

263
00:15:36,932 --> 00:15:38,199
Rym: No one complained about that.

264
00:15:38,662 --> 00:15:40,030
Rym: No one was sad about that.

265
00:15:40,311 --> 00:15:44,487
Rym: We just missed part of the Simpsons because that's fine because no one wanted to see the ads.

266
00:15:44,888 --> 00:15:45,009
Scott: Mm-hmm.

267
00:15:45,993 --> 00:15:51,582
Rym: so in a tiny kind of side news the The newest Android 7.0 is coming out.

268
00:15:51,623 --> 00:15:52,748
Rym: You know what they're calling it.

269
00:15:53,633 --> 00:15:54,659
Scott: What letter are we on?

270
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,249
Scott: and and Nutella?

271
00:15:57,031 --> 00:15:59,170
Scott: Nugget, okay, that's the second choice.

272
00:15:59,431 --> 00:16:00,555
Rym: I think Nutella is a trademark.

273
00:16:00,575 --> 00:16:05,070
Scott: that was that was actually my second guess cuz that was the only other end candy other than neko wafer.

274
00:16:05,393 --> 00:16:08,072
Rym: Yeah, neko wafer could have been good I think.

275
00:16:08,112 --> 00:16:11,242
Scott: but I realized after I said what was the first thing.

276
00:16:11,283 --> 00:16:13,570
Scott: I said Nutella that is trademark as a trademark.

277
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:20,078
Scott: But now it was also trademark and nougat is the only non trademark You know, yep, and there's the old.

278
00:16:20,098 --> 00:16:21,001
Rym: the news is pretty good.

279
00:16:21,061 --> 00:16:22,747
Rym: Like it's gonna go out to most Nexus devices.

280
00:16:23,008 --> 00:16:33,510
Rym: The only Sad thing about this update is that they're not pushing it to the Nexus 4 or 5. now You might say baram those show those phones are old as fuck and I would say yes, that is true.

281
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:34,176
Scott: What about that?

282
00:16:34,196 --> 00:16:35,044
Scott: What was the tablet?

283
00:16:35,064 --> 00:16:35,569
Scott: the Nexus?

284
00:16:35,569 --> 00:16:42,790
Rym: 7 like the first Nexus tablet It's not listed here is getting it but I don't know if it's not getting it because I have one.

285
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,035
Scott: I actually got one super cheap.

286
00:16:44,075 --> 00:16:44,939
Scott: It was like 10 bucks.

287
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,590
Scott: Oh, I use it just for the live wedge app.

288
00:16:48,092 --> 00:16:53,330
Rym: I was thinking about getting the smallest cheapest Android tablet at some point because I have that teleprompter.

289
00:16:54,435 --> 00:16:59,530
Rym: so I have the teleprompter and It works with a phone like you stick the phone in the bottom and it's teleprompter is tiny.

290
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:03,777
Rym: When I got my tiny phone My tiny phone barely fits in there.

291
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:08,656
Scott: Like it's a little too small actually because size it is And I'll tell you if the little tab little so.

292
00:17:08,675 --> 00:17:13,916
Rym: I kick-started a while ago and I even think about it the newer version of The teleprompter and it's way bigger.

293
00:17:13,936 --> 00:17:17,450
Rym: It literally my phone is literally too small to put in this teleprompter.

294
00:17:17,832 --> 00:17:18,939
Rym: So I need a tiny tablet.

295
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:25,069
Rym: I was last time you use the teleprompter I've practiced with it a bunch, but I haven't made any videos with it since the five nights of Fred because video.

296
00:17:25,713 --> 00:17:28,184
Scott: And now you're gonna buy a second teleprompter and you haven't used the first one

297
00:17:28,365 --> 00:17:37,948
Rym: because I use it once For one video and actually actually I've got a bunch of work work queued up and I'm probably gonna use it for that because it's Way easier to use a teleprompter for that kind of stuff.

298
00:17:38,832 --> 00:17:44,169
Rym: Like me looking into a screen talking about with method to and you're gonna time stamps NTP.

299
00:17:45,552 --> 00:17:48,459
Rym: so The Nexus 5 is not getting it.

300
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:53,800
Rym: but many people have pointed out that the Nexus 5 is 100% capable of running it like.

301
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,790
Rym: there's literally no reason not to push it out there.

302
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:56,296
Scott: I'm sure you can.

303
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,309
Scott: I'm sure you can just do it.

304
00:17:57,792 --> 00:17:59,340
Rym: I don't know, but you're not gonna get it automatically.

305
00:17:59,361 --> 00:18:01,090
Rym: you're gonna have to like fuck with it to make it happen.

306
00:18:01,594 --> 00:18:02,843
Rym: It's not just gonna come over the air.

307
00:18:02,863 --> 00:18:05,057
Scott: I mean, even though it's capable It's probably just a matter of.

308
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:07,530
Scott: they could only have so much time to test on so many devices.

309
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,869
Scott: They didn't go that far back and it's not worth it for them.

310
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:20,929
Rym: You get is the turning point because I think it's gonna sell Nexus fives if they do it, right my phone The Sony Xperia z5c comp like compact is the best Android hardware in the world.

311
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:23,641
Rym: bar None for a phone right now just for all those reasons.

312
00:18:24,063 --> 00:18:24,846
Rym: It is so powerful.

313
00:18:24,866 --> 00:18:25,650
Rym: Everything's great about it.

314
00:18:25,891 --> 00:18:28,970
Rym: The question will be will it get nougat or not?

315
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:32,993
Rym: because if it gets It's worth it.

316
00:18:33,033 --> 00:18:34,880
Scott: So the joys of an iPhone.

317
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:35,603
Scott: you're gonna get it.

318
00:18:35,623 --> 00:18:37,650
Rym: Oh, yeah the joys of this.

319
00:18:37,831 --> 00:18:41,167
Rym: It's waterproof and the battery lasts like 50 hours.

320
00:18:41,247 --> 00:18:43,897
Scott: legit iPhone battery last a fucking long time.

321
00:18:44,138 --> 00:18:45,384
Rym: your iPhone battery ran out.

322
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:48,660
Scott: when we were at Sandy Hooks I was running Strava like non.

323
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,510
Rym: I was running Strava to Scott.

324
00:18:52,072 --> 00:18:53,985
Rym: When we got home at the end of the day, I still had like 60% battery.

325
00:18:54,751 --> 00:18:56,649
Scott: I think I ran it on the boat though as my mistake.

326
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:03,907
Rym: But you know as I said, I got this z5c partly because it's like androids.

327
00:19:03,947 --> 00:19:04,509
Rym: last gas.

328
00:19:04,529 --> 00:19:10,913
Rym: and If this phone gets seven then androids still a good Still in the running.

329
00:19:11,535 --> 00:19:19,681
Rym: or if they release a z6c that is just a better phone then in a two-year cycle I'll just upgrade my Android phone to the newest Sony every two years.

330
00:19:20,705 --> 00:19:25,441
Rym: if neither of those happens iPhone 7 SE but you bottles Android apps.

331
00:19:25,461 --> 00:19:26,384
Scott: We're gonna do an iPhone.

332
00:19:26,404 --> 00:19:28,050
Rym: Yeah Android that let's see.

333
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,455
Rym: I bought dogcatcher.

334
00:19:29,495 --> 00:19:30,278
Rym: It's a podcatcher.

335
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:31,603
Rym: I cost like a dollar or two.

336
00:19:31,844 --> 00:19:33,310
Scott: The iPhone has one built-in you don't need.

337
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,636
Rym: I bought a Carcassonne.

338
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:36,001
Rym: Oh, no, I gotta buy that again.

339
00:19:36,021 --> 00:19:36,704
Scott: Yeah, I guess you do.

340
00:19:36,785 --> 00:19:38,090
Rym: I bought a super hexagon.

341
00:19:38,331 --> 00:19:39,655
Rym: Yeah, I don't need to buy that again.

342
00:19:39,695 --> 00:19:40,679
Rym: I play that game out.

343
00:19:41,562 --> 00:19:47,996
Rym: I bought settlers not gonna re-buy that now, uh I Think I bought anything else.

344
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:48,739
Scott: Okay.

345
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:49,342
Rym: Yeah.

346
00:19:49,824 --> 00:19:50,487
Rym: Oh though.

347
00:19:50,949 --> 00:19:53,301
Rym: Oh, yeah I didn't get the YubiKey or NFC.

348
00:19:53,682 --> 00:20:00,267
Rym: so I don't have to worry about that because Security keys with NFC do not work with iPhone because Apple just go fuck yourself.

349
00:20:00,348 --> 00:20:00,910
Rym: Apple doesn't care.

350
00:20:01,211 --> 00:20:04,020
Scott: Well, maybe one knows they got a new updates coming right away.

351
00:20:04,181 --> 00:20:06,649
Scott: Say they like to do everything after everyone else already does it?

352
00:20:08,172 --> 00:20:20,514
Rym: And the other news is interesting or at least vaguely interesting is that Skylake processors like it is still a golden age of if you have a bad old shitty or broken computer or like you're about To go to college.

353
00:20:20,896 --> 00:20:23,247
Rym: It is like the time to buy a computer.

354
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:39,105
Rym: Holy crap Like even if you don't need like the 1080 videos mostly Nvidia's fault yeah, but not just like processors have been plateaued for so long that you can get like the Fastest Intel i7 Skylake bullshit computer for like way under two grand.

355
00:20:39,265 --> 00:20:39,446
Scott: Yeah.

356
00:20:39,466 --> 00:20:40,148
Scott: I mean, that's what happens.

357
00:20:40,168 --> 00:20:47,273
Scott: like for example You know whenever a new thing comes out, not only is that new thing out, but the thing that is great But just now.

358
00:20:47,453 --> 00:20:49,761
Scott: one model old is now cheap for a thousand.

359
00:20:49,801 --> 00:20:51,687
Scott: nine eighties are going like all everyone's.

360
00:20:51,707 --> 00:20:56,201
Scott: getting nine eighties like 1080 is the loading up of nine eighties.

361
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:58,130
Rym: a thousand dollars including a video card.

362
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,238
Rym: You can buy a fucking supercomputer.

363
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:02,165
Rym: if you're willing to spend two grand.

364
00:21:02,506 --> 00:21:03,670
Rym: you can buy a god.

365
00:21:05,021 --> 00:21:21,135
Rym: but What's interesting is that the next generation was originally I think it was gonna be like a 10 nanometer process like they were gonna go like fucking crazy, but instead Kaby Lake, which is the next chip is It's still 14 nanometers far as I can tell.

366
00:21:21,175 --> 00:21:22,679
Rym: like it's not it's not going.

367
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,627
Scott: I was reading about the five nanometer process.

368
00:21:25,968 --> 00:21:32,090
Scott: Oh, so Here's the problem and they're discussing like what kind of gate they need to make to get this to work.

369
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:38,530
Scott: So like they're like we're gonna use the all-around gate or we're gonna use like the like the F whatever it's called.

370
00:21:38,711 --> 00:21:53,443
Rym: So I'm gonna tell you kids a secret if you buy computers ever like you know about computers And you know enough about processors to go to Wikipedia and click on like Kaby Lake to see like what's coming next The problem is you're always gonna see the next one.

371
00:21:53,985 --> 00:21:59,330
Rym: so I can see Kaby Lake Which isn't coming out really till like next year, but I can click on Canon Lake.

372
00:21:59,953 --> 00:22:07,101
Rym: And if I look at Canon Lake, I'm like, ooh, yes, I can wait for Canon Lake But then I can see that ice lake is the successor to that.

373
00:22:07,121 --> 00:22:12,739
Rym: and if I click on ice lake I can be like Oh, that's some 10 nanometer bullshit.

374
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:15,407
Rym: Ooh, but then I see that Tiger Lake is the success.

375
00:22:15,587 --> 00:22:16,610
Rym: You'll never buy a computer.

376
00:22:17,571 --> 00:22:19,519
Rym: You will never buy a computer if you get on that road.

377
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:20,122
Rym: Hmm.

378
00:22:20,503 --> 00:22:21,728
Rym: You got to just buy a computer.

379
00:22:21,969 --> 00:22:24,139
Scott: or Is the thing that some people do?

380
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,647
Scott: Yeah, they buy everything.

381
00:22:26,109 --> 00:22:27,708
Rym: true That happens.

382
00:22:28,152 --> 00:22:30,204
Rym: But in the very least you can look ahead and see.

383
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:33,899
Rym: is the next Architecture going to do something that I care about like?

384
00:22:33,939 --> 00:22:35,745
Rym: is it worth waiting like kind of?

385
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,230
Rym: could I use the computer?

386
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:41,390
Rym: I've got for another year because if I can I can get the next-gen architecture.

387
00:22:41,551 --> 00:22:44,190
Scott: I just use a thing until it's dead and then I get a new one.

388
00:22:44,331 --> 00:22:46,242
Scott: I don't really pay too much attention like what's.

389
00:22:46,484 --> 00:22:50,030
Scott: you know the timing is well I care about the only adjust my timing slightly.

390
00:22:50,171 --> 00:22:51,870
Scott: You know it's like if my shit's broke.

391
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:55,350
Scott: I need a new one and if I see something new is coming out in like two months like all right.

392
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:58,730
Scott: I wait two months, but if you get past that point where it's not broken yet.

393
00:23:00,091 --> 00:23:02,242
Rym: But it's like you have a choice.

394
00:23:02,302 --> 00:23:08,007
Rym: if you could upgrade now and get Significant benefits of grading or wait and get better benefits, right?

395
00:23:08,027 --> 00:23:08,790
Scott: Just how much am I gonna wait?

396
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:09,738
Scott: We're gonna wait a whole year.

397
00:23:09,758 --> 00:23:11,030
Scott: It's like how broken is my shit?

398
00:23:11,211 --> 00:23:11,512
Rym: Like?

399
00:23:11,753 --> 00:23:14,345
Rym: I don't think I can wait for KP Lake cuz my computer.

400
00:23:14,807 --> 00:23:15,490
Rym: I need a new computer.

401
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:16,958
Rym: I'm gonna buy the baddest ass guy.

402
00:23:17,018 --> 00:23:18,144
Scott: Peter looks like it's working to me.

403
00:23:18,164 --> 00:23:23,209
Rym: Uh Yeah, it is working But it's not fast enough anymore.

404
00:23:23,691 --> 00:23:25,357
Scott: Is there anything you did where it didn't?

405
00:23:25,518 --> 00:23:26,060
Scott: didn't get the job?

406
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,950
Rym: editing 4k video playing some modern games?

407
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:33,029
Rym: copying large files from flashcards to the computer?

408
00:23:34,072 --> 00:23:35,316
Rym: Because I've used v2.

409
00:23:35,557 --> 00:23:37,984
Scott: Oh, yeah USB 3 is computers so old.

410
00:23:38,144 --> 00:23:40,432
Scott: there isn't a USB 3 PCI Express card You can get.

411
00:23:40,573 --> 00:23:43,630
Rym: I could but all my PCI slots are filled with shit and one of them doesn't work.

412
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:45,216
Scott: How many devices do you have?

413
00:23:45,618 --> 00:23:46,682
Rym: his computer's all knife?

414
00:23:46,723 --> 00:23:47,104
Scott: I don't have.

415
00:23:47,124 --> 00:23:48,550
Scott: like any PCI Express things.

416
00:23:48,691 --> 00:23:51,631
Rym: I have one that's broken and There's.

417
00:23:51,792 --> 00:23:53,296
Rym: there's a bunch of problems my computer.

418
00:23:53,858 --> 00:24:00,041
Scott: But anyway, the news another thing that Rym broke on purpose to excuse buying a new No peed on his computer.

419
00:24:00,061 --> 00:24:00,403
Scott: I saw him.

420
00:24:00,423 --> 00:24:06,273
Rym: Yeah But anyway, the news is that Kaby Lake Intel's going big on.

421
00:24:06,313 --> 00:24:18,370
Rym: the thing that it does is that the built-in Intel video stuff like if you don't have a video card Can play overwatch on like pretty big settings like straight up and play 4k video like it's nothing.

422
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:28,694
Scott: Yeah, I don't really believe this because I'm sure I saw videos of like, you know, the old Intel You know video chips that they come in laptops and stuff and they would be like, oh, yeah These are totally great.

423
00:24:28,714 --> 00:24:45,564
Rym: You can totally game with these and once you totally game with the Intel 7 stuff in my laptop and once you finally get one, they're garbage my laptop I think my my Lenovo 230 with a core i7 can place at 5. it can play overwatch Just with the settings down like it works.

424
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:45,887
Rym: fine.

425
00:24:46,954 --> 00:24:49,133
Rym: Place rocket League Like a champ.

426
00:24:49,494 --> 00:24:50,416
Rym: Yeah, it does.

427
00:24:50,437 --> 00:24:51,118
Rym: It's garbage.

428
00:24:51,379 --> 00:24:52,924
Rym: Okay, but it totally does.

429
00:24:53,465 --> 00:25:05,089
Rym: but this this chipset Now would be that like I would before we were talking about how now might be the time to like upgrade your HTPC because it'll Last forever, especially as you can get the tiny 1080s and make a tiny computer.

430
00:25:05,851 --> 00:25:08,844
Rym: You might be able to go even tinier if you can hold out till Kaby Lake.

431
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:11,439
Rym: cuz if Kaby Lake holds up you can make A flat computer.

432
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,630
Rym: Yeah, you can make a computer.

433
00:25:12,992 --> 00:25:20,482
Rym: That's just a tiny motherboard with a CPU in it Like an m.2 hard drive stuck into it and one RAM stick stuck into it.

434
00:25:20,723 --> 00:25:21,465
Rym: That's the whole computer.

435
00:25:21,505 --> 00:25:28,029
Scott: It'll play games it the sideways Laptop RAM basically a laptop without a screen with a bunch of USBs and HDMI.

436
00:25:28,551 --> 00:25:33,010
Rym: That's probably about the size of the 95 watt power supply from my laptop, right?

437
00:25:33,971 --> 00:25:35,380
Scott: And just put that under your TV.

438
00:25:35,401 --> 00:25:39,560
Rym: Yeah get less furniture If you're a computer like PC gaming enthusiast.

439
00:25:40,183 --> 00:25:41,970
Rym: now is the time to be alive.

440
00:25:48,361 --> 00:25:50,547
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

441
00:25:50,929 --> 00:25:52,935
Rym: so our friends Phil and Jay.

442
00:25:52,975 --> 00:25:55,739
Rym: Phil sent me a link and he was like I have a thing of the day for you.

443
00:25:55,901 --> 00:26:00,966
Scott: Well, in other words Rym is so bad at finding things the day He can only get a good one when someone else better than him.

444
00:26:01,167 --> 00:26:11,419
Rym: of everyone who'd expressed an opinion and the old man chopping garlic versus funny overwatch video thing of the day 100% of those opinions said that my thing of the day about overwatch was funnier.

445
00:26:12,042 --> 00:26:19,500
Scott: I asked I asked all the people in a small town in Wyoming Who is gonna be president and all of them said it would be Donald Trump.

446
00:26:19,721 --> 00:26:21,129
Rym: Yeah, that's that's.

447
00:26:21,571 --> 00:26:23,160
Scott: that is the equivalent of what you just said.

448
00:26:23,441 --> 00:26:28,020
Rym: All right, does anyone think that Scott's old man chopping garlic was better than funny overwatch video?

449
00:26:29,082 --> 00:26:30,899
Scott: Yeah, anyone who isn't a 13 year old kid?

450
00:26:32,265 --> 00:26:39,258
Rym: anyway Whenever someone because a lot of people, you know, you know like Luke Crane with this thing where people like, you know You should do and he's like, you know you should do.

451
00:26:39,941 --> 00:26:53,749
Rym: So people always are like, you know What would be a good thing at the day and they send me stuff and it's usually stuff that either already was the thing of the day or that is like five to ten years old and they just found it recently, but this is Something special.

452
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:54,820
Rym: so I get to set the stage.

453
00:26:55,221 --> 00:26:58,631
Rym: There's a YouTube channel and this YouTube channel is called.

454
00:26:58,651 --> 00:26:59,935
Rym: I'm gonna zoom in on this.

455
00:27:00,176 --> 00:27:01,600
Rym: What is the YouTube channel actually called?

456
00:27:02,901 --> 00:27:11,257
Rym: so I think it's just called sitting and smiling and the guy live streams like every day or two a video.

457
00:27:12,301 --> 00:27:24,540
Rym: There's hundreds of them and Every one of these live streams is called sitting and smiling and then the number of the episode and it's him for about two hours Just sitting cross-legged with lighting smiling at the camera.

458
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:28,920
Scott: So he's just like a meditating dude, but he videos himself meditating and that's it on you.

459
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,030
Rym: There's a tiny chance like there's ways you could fake the live stream.

460
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,114
Scott: Sure.

461
00:27:33,154 --> 00:27:34,840
Scott: I'm sure you could but these videos exist.

462
00:27:35,081 --> 00:27:37,371
Scott: But I mean plenty of people meditate two hours a day.

463
00:27:37,491 --> 00:27:41,067
Scott: So making a stream of it is not unrealistic Yeah, but he does it like he sits down.

464
00:27:41,087 --> 00:27:44,020
Rym: He just does it with a goofy smile sitting there two hours every day or so.

465
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:55,720
Scott: in one of these videos Somebody post a comment that says like in one of the videos he stops smiley frowns for a second.

466
00:27:55,962 --> 00:27:56,709
Scott: Can you find it?

467
00:27:56,749 --> 00:27:57,294
Scott: and you have.

468
00:27:57,516 --> 00:27:57,819
Scott: you have like?

469
00:27:57,819 --> 00:28:00,980
Scott: 200 hours of video to look through and you're never gonna find it.

470
00:28:01,322 --> 00:28:03,639
Rym: I'm gonna quote this thing that I'm looking at right here.

471
00:28:04,342 --> 00:28:09,220
Rym: The episode of sitting and smiling features a very special guest about 2.5 hours in the webcast.

472
00:28:09,822 --> 00:28:10,827
Scott: At least they tell you when it is.

473
00:28:10,847 --> 00:28:11,249
Scott: That's nice.

474
00:28:11,429 --> 00:28:12,052
Rym: This is the guy.

475
00:28:12,313 --> 00:28:18,020
Rym: I hear someone come into the house Which is odd because only my housemate is at work and we aren't expecting anyone.

476
00:28:18,421 --> 00:28:21,330
Rym: I realized I didn't check to see if the doors are locked before starting the webcast.

477
00:28:21,952 --> 00:28:32,617
Rym: I hear the person stealthily moving around the house Mm-hmm, and then I hear them stealthily climbing the stairs toward my room the door opens and then I hear an unfamiliar male voice Say hello.

478
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:42,929
Rym: Then after presumably seeing me sitting still and smiling in front of a camera lit from beneath by a fluorescent bulb He promptly descends the stairs and exits the house.

479
00:28:43,572 --> 00:28:45,860
Rym: Okay, you can see this happen at two thirty six thirty.

480
00:28:48,462 --> 00:28:59,814
Rym: So that is my thing of the day that the best guess is that a robber broke into this house And later on like yes Like the guy who's in for that robbery came in.

481
00:28:59,834 --> 00:29:09,925
Rym: because think about this you break into a house You think it's empty you're going around getting to rob stuff and then you come into a room and you see a dude Just sitting there smiling at a camera and not moving Silently with weird lighting.

482
00:29:09,945 --> 00:29:11,892
Rym: Yeah, I think I would abscond.

483
00:29:12,514 --> 00:29:14,100
Scott: Yeah, I mean the guy saw your face.

484
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,110
Scott: So even if you steal stuff, oh, he doesn't see.

485
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:18,260
Rym: I don't know if he cuz the guy just saw like the shadow.

486
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,184
Rym: I think cuz.

487
00:29:19,445 --> 00:29:24,292
Rym: in the video the guys like his eyes kind of like look to the side, but he doesn't turn his head He doesn't interrupt the smiling.

488
00:29:24,312 --> 00:29:28,712
Rym: Mm-hmm Also props to the guy for like not interrupting the smiling.

489
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:31,926
Scott: I mean like that's pro dude I mean, he's mad Zen.

490
00:29:31,946 --> 00:29:32,388
Scott: That's his deal.

491
00:29:32,408 --> 00:29:32,790
Scott: Oh my god.

492
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:33,795
Rym: These videos have like 20,000 views each.

493
00:29:35,242 --> 00:29:36,609
Scott: Well, you know you can be.

494
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:38,900
Scott: you can you can transfer his energies to you and shit.

495
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:45,516
Rym: I'm gonna do a red super and I'm gonna watch one of his videos and live stream myself watching it at some point After packs, can you sit and smile for two hours?

496
00:29:45,556 --> 00:29:46,100
Scott: I don't know.

497
00:29:46,321 --> 00:29:46,763
Scott: You know what?

498
00:29:46,783 --> 00:29:49,959
Scott: I don't think you could even shut up for two hours unless you're sleeping.

499
00:29:52,722 --> 00:29:57,588
Rym: Why don't we do a smile off let alone like keeping your body still Got one to a live stream smile off.

500
00:29:57,628 --> 00:29:59,015
Rym: you and me both smile at the camera.

501
00:29:59,055 --> 00:30:00,060
Rym: first one to go away loses.

502
00:30:00,383 --> 00:30:02,099
Scott: Oh, you want a Zen Zen battle then off?

503
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:05,440
Rym: I feel like I would bet money to the purposes of Zen.

504
00:30:05,741 --> 00:30:10,937
Scott: I would bet money's real pictures of presidents that are dead that I could beat you.

505
00:30:10,957 --> 00:30:11,780
Scott: Why don't we?

506
00:30:12,862 --> 00:30:17,217
Rym: Why don't we both bet on ourselves, but let me bet on me, but let the listener.

507
00:30:17,237 --> 00:30:19,926
Rym: Oh, I'm gonna bet on me But let the listeners bet.

508
00:30:20,126 --> 00:30:21,973
Scott: no, so it's basically you can't sleep.

509
00:30:22,575 --> 00:30:23,518
Scott: You have to stay awake.

510
00:30:23,538 --> 00:30:23,939
Scott: You can blink.

511
00:30:23,979 --> 00:30:28,209
Rym: I guess You can retain a calm smile.

512
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:31,957
Scott: you cannot go you have to smile not move a lot.

513
00:30:32,298 --> 00:30:32,900
Rym: you can fidget.

514
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:33,100
Rym: fidget.

515
00:30:33,201 --> 00:30:33,804
Rym: He's okay Scott.

516
00:30:33,824 --> 00:30:35,554
Rym: if we had to know it was not don't fidget off.

517
00:30:35,615 --> 00:30:36,520
Scott: I mean does he not fidget?

518
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:37,802
Scott: I can't fidget.

519
00:30:38,043 --> 00:30:42,899
Scott: I mean I didn't watch a lot of these meditate without sleeping and smile.

520
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:49,125
Scott: Oh shit These are four hours long not to know and see how long you can go and the first person to know It's live stream.

521
00:30:49,145 --> 00:30:51,158
Scott: So everyone's watching and they can tell who's the winner.

522
00:30:51,178 --> 00:30:52,951
Rym: now I'm just thinking that Simpsons episode.

523
00:30:53,092 --> 00:30:54,040
Rym: eat your broccoli.

524
00:30:54,743 --> 00:30:57,737
Scott: We can actually have the listeners like vote who they think the winner is like because they'll be like.

525
00:30:57,797 --> 00:30:59,544
Scott: Rym moved it You know one hour in.

526
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:03,800
Scott: and then if only like five people say that Rym moved an hour in but everyone else votes for.

527
00:31:04,301 --> 00:31:06,227
Scott: Scott moved it, you know 45 minutes.

528
00:31:06,307 --> 00:31:06,648
Scott: Yeah.

529
00:31:07,029 --> 00:31:08,092
Scott: Yeah, son.

530
00:31:08,353 --> 00:31:10,539
Rym: You're definitely eating this broccoli now.

531
00:31:12,342 --> 00:31:21,893
Scott: So my thing today once it gets a really good thing today, but it's not your thing of the day It's my thing of the day Phil's thing of the day, dude You're going by my thing I think of the days are farks or something.

532
00:31:22,014 --> 00:31:24,424
Scott: Awfuls or Better than rims.

533
00:31:24,444 --> 00:31:24,826
Scott: thing of the day.

534
00:31:24,846 --> 00:31:29,505
Scott: cuz rims thing of the day was nothing because it was Phil's thing of the day he used And mine is actually great.

535
00:31:29,565 --> 00:31:30,086
Scott: Nonetheless.

536
00:31:30,107 --> 00:31:32,253
Rym: This is real great as I'm scrolling through this.

537
00:31:32,373 --> 00:31:34,680
Scott: So if you go to Disney World, didn't he world?

538
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:38,349
Scott: There's Epcot where the big dome ball thing is.

539
00:31:38,389 --> 00:31:39,152
Rym: Yeah, I fuck.

540
00:31:39,232 --> 00:31:41,760
Rym: I love Epcot way more than like every other part.

541
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,607
Scott: It is an inside the ball thing.

542
00:31:43,627 --> 00:31:44,390
Scott: I'm pretty sure it's.

543
00:31:44,430 --> 00:32:07,600
Scott: inside the ball is the thing called horizons, which is basically a remake of Tomorrowland from the World's Fair which is basically a ride where you get on a little car and it goes around real slow and you look at stuff and the things you look at our little animatronic life-size dioramas of like futuristic kitchens and you know futuristic farms and sort of like.

544
00:32:07,881 --> 00:32:12,720
Scott: You know totally kitsch what they thought the future is gonna be like in the 60s kind of stuff.

545
00:32:14,343 --> 00:32:15,571
Scott: Right, and it's totally awesome.

546
00:32:16,175 --> 00:32:27,814
Scott: these people Way back in the 90s, which is probably around the time that I went there They figured out how to get into this ride Not just into the ride like you wait in line and you ride it cuz you know what.

547
00:32:27,834 --> 00:32:29,000
Scott: there's no line for this fucking thing.

548
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,994
Scott: You could just yeah, you can just get on whenever you want.

549
00:32:32,014 --> 00:32:33,300
Scott: You could ride it like five times in a row.

550
00:32:33,822 --> 00:32:35,490
Scott: They figured out how to get behind the scenes.

551
00:32:35,792 --> 00:32:37,360
Scott: They figured out there were hidden rooms.

552
00:32:37,761 --> 00:32:38,685
Scott: There's like they were.

553
00:32:38,805 --> 00:32:44,629
Scott: they would know like when the cars are coming so they could go chill in the diorama and then be Out before the next car came.

554
00:32:44,689 --> 00:32:47,140
Scott: people these photos are so great.

555
00:32:47,261 --> 00:32:53,367
Scott: They knew how to not get killed because it's very easy to die when there's this sort of Carousel machine going around.

556
00:32:53,428 --> 00:32:56,060
Scott: it could easily crush you right like a subway.

557
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,148
Scott: They learn how to not get killed.

558
00:32:58,168 --> 00:32:58,449
Scott: they were.

559
00:32:58,570 --> 00:32:59,714
Scott: they got partied back there.

560
00:32:59,755 --> 00:33:02,124
Scott: They got drunk back there They quote.

561
00:33:02,165 --> 00:33:04,876
Rym: of course that kind of confidence can only give it away to a higher risk of danger.

562
00:33:04,957 --> 00:33:09,372
Rym: one evening who'd haphazardly Stepped on a rotten piece of plywood and fractured his right foot.

563
00:33:09,452 --> 00:33:11,700
Rym: another night chief cut his head wide open.

564
00:33:12,141 --> 00:33:16,597
Rym: The danger they put themselves into was actually far higher than either of them realized at the time.

565
00:33:16,737 --> 00:33:17,480
Scott: It's very dangerous.

566
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:23,497
Scott: It's like this big machine basically and you're going to easily have their arm or leg completely severed by the heavy machinery.

567
00:33:23,638 --> 00:33:27,444
Scott: Yes easily But I guess that didn't happen.

568
00:33:27,865 --> 00:33:29,550
Rym: they risked life and limb.

569
00:33:29,771 --> 00:33:33,220
Rym: to make sure horizons were you remembered and now it has been.

570
00:33:34,263 --> 00:33:39,857
Scott: so yeah, um The thing I wonder about this is how did they get into Disney World so often?

571
00:33:39,877 --> 00:33:40,640
Scott: were they buying tickets?

572
00:33:40,721 --> 00:33:42,494
Scott: They have like year-round passes or something like.

573
00:33:42,514 --> 00:33:43,360
Rym: maybe I guess season pass.

574
00:33:43,441 --> 00:33:45,758
Rym: I mean when I was a kid Cedar Point like they went to town.

575
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:48,500
Scott: well I mean you get Disney World doesn't close so you can go there year-round.

576
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:55,851
Scott: It's in Florida, but they it's like they worked in Florida somewhere and after work every day They went to Disney World with their annual pass.

577
00:33:55,891 --> 00:33:57,198
Scott: It's like how often did they go there?

578
00:33:57,238 --> 00:33:57,499
Scott: like what?

579
00:33:58,481 --> 00:33:59,205
Scott: What kind of life?

580
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,331
Rym: an annual pass?

581
00:34:00,653 --> 00:34:03,345
Rym: I'm looking up right now For fuck.

582
00:34:03,365 --> 00:34:07,445
Rym: so wow it's way cheaper than I realized You got to live in Disney World.

583
00:34:07,826 --> 00:34:17,699
Rym: an annual pass to go to fucking anything anytime you want forever with no blackout dates Except for it doesn't get you into special event things that need like their own.

584
00:34:18,283 --> 00:34:20,320
Scott: Like you can't go to like a character breakfast with that shit.

585
00:34:20,501 --> 00:34:24,800
Scott: Yeah, you have to make a reservation for that separately, but you can just ride Space Mountain all day every day.

586
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,684
Scott: $829 that's it.

587
00:34:26,784 --> 00:34:28,150
Scott: That's about right dude.

588
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:31,103
Rym: a season pass to Cedar Point when I was a kid was like 200.

589
00:34:31,103 --> 00:34:34,853
Scott: Yeah, all right cool Cuz no one can fucking use that.

590
00:34:35,456 --> 00:34:44,620
Rym: in the moment We're gonna be live at PAX West which is coming up real soon soon Saturday September 3rd 5 p.m.. Chicken theater the grind.

591
00:34:46,043 --> 00:34:57,738
Rym: It's very funny that I tweeted about it And then literally the next tweet in my feed immediately was this article that was like now's the time to love to power Level up all your wow characters.

592
00:34:59,022 --> 00:35:00,148
Rym: It was like a Kotaku article.

593
00:35:00,208 --> 00:35:01,976
Scott: I think another wow expansion is coming.

594
00:35:02,097 --> 00:35:03,684
Scott: yeah I don't know why.

595
00:35:03,925 --> 00:35:04,969
Scott: and then independently

596
00:35:05,009 --> 00:35:30,000
Rym: because of that a whole bunch of people in my feed We're all tweeting about like enjoying grinding someone who I won't name in our forum and someone else I won't name on Twitter both today express their love of going like back into old content and MMOs and Grinding the shit out of it and someone else the third person was complaining that a lot of modern MMOs don't have as much grind as the old one, so I feel like our panel aptly timed.

597
00:35:32,121 --> 00:35:32,683
Rym: So you got anything?

598
00:35:32,703 --> 00:35:34,108
Rym: What other meta stuff do we got?

599
00:35:35,693 --> 00:35:37,078
Rym: The book club book is Rebecca.

600
00:35:41,085 --> 00:35:45,011
Rym: There is another book club book Orcs and Crake that we already did a show on.

601
00:35:45,414 --> 00:35:46,680
Rym: there is a third book club.

602
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:47,764
Rym: It's a new book club.

603
00:35:47,824 --> 00:35:55,500
Rym: Scott's not involved because he hates this stuff, and he doesn't want to learn anything, but me Kremlian, Andrew, Ro, Kate, a few other people.

604
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,549
Rym: We're starting a separate book club.

605
00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:07,040
Rym: That's basically an international politics Salon we're gonna do is we're gonna pick a nonfiction book every month or two or an article like a long-form article.

606
00:36:07,361 --> 00:36:12,319
Rym: We're all gonna read it, and then we're gonna argue about the topic that was discussed by the article.

607
00:36:13,461 --> 00:36:19,380
Rym: We're all gonna do our own independent research beyond because you know the article might be wrong the book might be biased whatever.

608
00:36:19,561 --> 00:36:27,660
Rym: But the point is we're going to learn about and research a very narrow and specific Like real-world topic and then argue about it on the show for an hour.

609
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,650
Rym: And then I have a forum thread just like the book club.

610
00:36:29,691 --> 00:36:30,756
Scott: Don't waste your time with this kid.

611
00:36:30,796 --> 00:36:37,340
Rym: so the first book We're doing is a relatively recent history book by Richard Evans called the coming of the Third Reich.

612
00:36:37,923 --> 00:36:39,070
Scott: Yeah, just so you need to know about.

613
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:43,609
Rym: but this one is not the typical History channel cries rise of the Nazi Party.

614
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:51,031
Rym: This is more a history of the Weimar Republic and like the situation in the pan-german areas that led to all this.

615
00:36:51,573 --> 00:36:52,877
Rym: and I've read about two-thirds of it.

616
00:36:53,298 --> 00:37:14,919
Rym: and this is Fascinating because while I know a lot about the era before World War one, and I know a lot about like 1939 through 1945 I didn't know a lot about the Weimar Republic and this shit is Fascinating mm-hmm and this book is one of the few that is Popping off to where like I can read it without like having to do a lot of research.

617
00:37:15,961 --> 00:37:20,036
Rym: Also Scott who's complaining so much about everyone wasting their time and not bettering themselves.

618
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,260
Rym: Why are you reading all this fiction?

619
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,519
Rym: Why do you care about this Rebecca book?

620
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:31,424
Rym: All right, all right anti intellectual Scott What else we got?

621
00:37:31,766 --> 00:37:44,690
Rym: our video Atari game design is up on YouTube for your enjoyment If you're a backer of the patreon, there is one more slot in the eight player play by mail Civ 5 Extreme game that I'm gonna be playing with you guys.

622
00:37:44,731 --> 00:37:45,594
Scott: No one's filling that slot.

623
00:37:45,835 --> 00:37:46,980
Rym: one spot remains.

624
00:37:47,121 --> 00:37:56,300
Rym: well, I just opened it up to the regular patrons like Yesterday and most of the people in the game are these super patrons give a dollar take the slot and then stop giving the dollar.

625
00:37:57,061 --> 00:37:57,845
Scott: Go join the game.

626
00:37:57,905 --> 00:38:02,221
Scott: the game will be locked in sure and then Rym won't even get your $1.

627
00:38:02,221 --> 00:38:06,957
Rym: I'm totally happy for that cuz frankly a lot of people are giving away more money than they need to.

628
00:38:07,278 --> 00:38:17,624
Rym: to be honest I was kind of hoping that every listener would just give a dollar but instead there's like a few hundred of you Some of you are giving way more than a dollar Has lots of money.

629
00:38:17,664 --> 00:38:19,210
Scott: you probably don't what the fuck is wrong with you.

630
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:20,815
Rym: that money has not been spent.

631
00:38:21,197 --> 00:38:32,580
Rym: all that money and Believe me you will know about every penny that I spend and that money is only gonna be yeah I'm gonna flaunt it in pictures of like selfies of me with expensive shit luxury brands.

632
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,865
Scott: This is why I am.

633
00:38:34,046 --> 00:38:35,593
Rym: none of that money is going to Scott.

634
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:39,648
Scott: if the money goes to see me in my bed It'll be because I bought equipment that Scott will use.

635
00:38:39,668 --> 00:38:45,864
Rym: and Scott has already tried to convince me to buy a like a camera for him yeah, and He could not convince me.

636
00:38:45,884 --> 00:38:52,549
Rym: that would be used for a GeekNights' patron or listener project photos of all the patrons everyone.

637
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:55,032
Rym: actually That would be a cool project.

638
00:38:55,052 --> 00:39:00,677
Scott: if we traveled to All the pen and I'll write dumb dumb head on the photo and put it on the internet where everyone can see.

639
00:39:00,697 --> 00:39:08,997
Rym: if we use The money to over the course of a year like I've all the plays Live take like one good portrait of every one of them and then make a collection.

640
00:39:09,037 --> 00:39:09,980
Rym: that would actually be a cool thing.

641
00:39:10,422 --> 00:39:11,607
Rym: I'd be willing to spend the money on that.

642
00:39:11,908 --> 00:39:13,515
Rym: that would cost way more than the money.

643
00:39:13,535 --> 00:39:14,398
Rym: We've collected so far.

644
00:39:15,428 --> 00:39:16,015
Scott: Give more money.

645
00:39:16,035 --> 00:39:16,400
Scott: What's wrong?

646
00:39:19,002 --> 00:39:19,403
Scott: The reason it

647
00:39:19,424 --> 00:39:30,665
Rym: would cost so much is that a not small number of the patrons are Australians who really wants to come back to Paxos and I don't know if it's gonna happen this year because I have a work conference In Australia,

648
00:39:30,725 --> 00:39:32,172
Scott: we'll go to Monaco for the Grand Prix.

649
00:39:32,192 --> 00:39:33,217
Scott: That's halfway to Australia.

650
00:39:34,823 --> 00:39:36,717
Rym: I go to Singapore every year for f1.

651
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:38,950
Scott: I'm not saying go to Monaco though.

652
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:40,659
Rym: You want to come with me next year to Singapore and see f1?

653
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:41,904
Scott: No, I got Monica.

654
00:39:42,266 --> 00:39:44,579
Rym: Singapore is way cheaper to get into f1 the Monaco.

655
00:39:45,402 --> 00:39:47,500
Scott: But why would I want to go to Singapore?

656
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:48,740
Rym: Singapore is cool.

657
00:39:48,861 --> 00:39:51,480
Rym: We can spend like a week in Singapore doing the f1 shit.

658
00:39:51,701 --> 00:39:55,753
Rym: Monaco has a prince and then we can just go to Hong Kong and those principality.

659
00:39:55,794 --> 00:39:56,536
Scott: What's Singapore?

660
00:39:56,556 --> 00:39:57,278
Scott: a city-state?

661
00:39:57,499 --> 00:39:59,367
Scott: Yeah Yeah, it's got city states.

662
00:39:59,408 --> 00:40:00,533
Rym: give you all this happiness.

663
00:40:00,553 --> 00:40:01,799
Rym: you get luxury goods out of them.

664
00:40:02,841 --> 00:40:05,680
Scott: The Principality is a luxury good.

665
00:40:10,382 --> 00:40:12,058
Rym: Also, Scott is doing a YouTube show.

666
00:40:13,361 --> 00:40:16,960
Scott: I'm doing a lot of YouTube shows, but only one of them requires no effort.

667
00:40:17,643 --> 00:40:21,339
Scott: So if you go to my youtube channel, you'll get stuff that doesn't cost you any money.

668
00:40:22,202 --> 00:40:24,070
Rym: It's a pretty good show all the time.

669
00:40:24,492 --> 00:40:25,657
Rym: It's basically lunch with Scott.

670
00:40:25,738 --> 00:40:26,200
Scott: I watch it.

671
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:29,131
Scott: Well, everything's gonna be with Scott because I started with netrunner with Scott.

672
00:40:29,151 --> 00:40:31,440
Scott: So it's gonna be asterisk with Scott.

673
00:40:32,002 --> 00:40:34,452
Scott: So everything else I do is also gonna be something with Scott.

674
00:40:34,472 --> 00:40:36,500
Scott: but lunch is almost every day.

675
00:40:36,701 --> 00:40:39,140
Rym: Well, you guys saw to remember we were doing Rym versus Scott.

676
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,492
Rym: That's the one where Scott and I were playing these duels of said five.

677
00:40:41,874 --> 00:40:43,140
Rym: It's not gonna just be said five.

678
00:40:43,321 --> 00:40:44,464
Rym: We're gonna do like everything.

679
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:46,291
Rym: that's just us fighting with each other.

680
00:40:46,431 --> 00:40:47,515
Scott: You decided that I didn't.

681
00:40:47,755 --> 00:40:48,779
Rym: I did just decide that.

682
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:52,904
Rym: Yeah Yeah, and I'm gonna try to keep doing it Resist doing it.

683
00:40:53,648 --> 00:40:55,657
Rym: All right, take that not a patreon thing.

684
00:40:55,717 --> 00:40:56,420
Rym: It's just on YouTube.

685
00:40:56,641 --> 00:40:58,088
Scott: Well, that's your video right there.

686
00:40:58,149 --> 00:41:00,259
Scott: Rym for Scott gets Scott to do a video Scott wins.

687
00:41:02,884 --> 00:41:04,800
Rym: Do you want an argument?

688
00:41:07,201 --> 00:41:07,965
Scott: This is an argument.

689
00:41:08,267 --> 00:41:10,760
Rym: All right, so, uh, we got tickets to a thing.

690
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,951
Rym: Well Scott saw this thing.

691
00:41:11,992 --> 00:41:12,739
Rym: we got tickets to it.

692
00:41:13,021 --> 00:41:17,180
Rym: But I'm gonna read you the title of what the thing is and that's the reason why we're not gonna do a main bit.

693
00:41:18,341 --> 00:41:25,697
Rym: We are going to right now the Queen's Dinner Club colon Mothership meat company, right?

694
00:41:25,717 --> 00:41:27,834
Scott: Well the There's a barbecue place.

695
00:41:27,894 --> 00:41:28,380
Scott: It's pretty good.

696
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,520
Scott: That's near here and the guy who owns that opened up a new barbecue place that is an even bigger cooker.

697
00:41:32,721 --> 00:41:34,639
Scott: So he doesn't run out of food like he does the other place.

698
00:41:35,202 --> 00:41:36,526
Scott: But it's a different style of barbecue.

699
00:41:36,566 --> 00:41:40,360
Scott: It's Texas style, which I actually prefer and it's not open yet.

700
00:41:40,661 --> 00:41:42,410
Scott: But how are we eating there?

701
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:44,360
Scott: Because if you buy tickets, there's like a preview night.

702
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:49,340
Scott: I guess he wants to fit, you know, see if his foods any good and it's like four blocks away from this apartment.

703
00:41:49,581 --> 00:41:55,900
Scott: So we're gonna walk over there and eat barbecue all that cornbread and it's gonna have the same amazing cornbread from the other place.

704
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,889
Scott: So all right, I just want to eat.

705
00:41:57,909 --> 00:41:58,774
Scott: I'll just get back dude.

706
00:41:58,894 --> 00:41:59,356
Scott: Keep your meats.
