1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,439
Rym: it's Tuesday April 12th 2016.

2
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:17,411
Rym: I'm Rym I am Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:17,471 --> 00:00:19,717
Rym: me Tomo cuz that's technically a game.

4
00:00:21,902 --> 00:00:22,965
Scott: let's do this.

5
00:00:22,985 --> 00:00:25,772
Rym: so Scott I got a concern.

6
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:26,596
Rym: I got.

7
00:00:26,636 --> 00:00:32,061
Scott: I got a real concern a concern or this is it that Korean TV show I stopped watching about people with concerns?

8
00:00:32,203 --> 00:00:42,861
Rym: so my concern is that in our long-form Civ 5 game with all of our friends you shared a continent with a dangerous AI and a dangerous Lisa.

9
00:00:42,881 --> 00:00:45,289
Scott: uh-huh she disposed of that dangerous AI.

10
00:00:45,551 --> 00:00:46,798
Scott: apparently it wasn't so dangerous.

11
00:00:46,918 --> 00:00:54,858
Rym: our concern is that she's about to dispose of you and then the rest of us gonna have to deal with this like existential threat to our being.

12
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:56,124
Scott: that's somewhat likely.

13
00:00:56,164 --> 00:00:58,921
Scott: she's got like four military units next to what my second city.

14
00:00:58,981 --> 00:01:00,691
Scott: I don't even have four military units total.

15
00:01:00,892 --> 00:01:01,173
Scott: Scott.

16
00:01:01,214 --> 00:01:03,242
Rym: do not go quietly into that night.

17
00:01:03,383 --> 00:01:04,447
Scott: what am I supposed to do?

18
00:01:04,507 --> 00:01:09,646
Scott: resist just make my spearmen poke the archer once before it dies.

19
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:10,208
Scott: I mean what?

20
00:01:10,509 --> 00:01:11,334
Rym: what just archer?

21
00:01:11,354 --> 00:01:12,641
Rym: did you have catapults hanging out?

22
00:01:13,023 --> 00:01:14,451
Rym: what did you have catapults like?

23
00:01:14,612 --> 00:01:16,139
Scott: I haven't seen a catapult.

24
00:01:16,179 --> 00:01:21,782
Scott: I've seen there's like four chariot archers next to my city so you need to have a few.

25
00:01:21,862 --> 00:01:25,115
Rym: make like a horseman or something okay so I do have a horse?

26
00:01:25,516 --> 00:01:27,103
Rym: yeah make it make it a horseman right.

27
00:01:27,183 --> 00:01:30,214
Scott: but uh no I have horses the resource.

28
00:01:30,736 --> 00:01:37,039
Scott: oh so by the time I make a horseman if I stop doing what I'm doing now I will already be dead.

29
00:01:37,642 --> 00:01:38,607
Rym: what are you doing now?

30
00:01:38,667 --> 00:01:40,816
Rym: that's more important than making a military unit.

31
00:01:42,081 --> 00:01:43,326
Scott: I think I'm making a military.

32
00:01:43,527 --> 00:01:47,985
Rym: okay as long as you're making a military you just don't don't go too easy.

33
00:01:48,065 --> 00:01:48,568
Scott: what am I?

34
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:49,752
Scott: there's no point though like what's.

35
00:01:49,993 --> 00:01:52,122
Rym: what's the point if you give me the city?

36
00:01:52,182 --> 00:01:52,765
Rym: I'll resist.

37
00:01:53,849 --> 00:01:56,163
Scott: if you know how to resist better than I do I think I do.

38
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:57,068
Rym: I'm good at advanced wars.

39
00:01:57,229 --> 00:01:59,180
Rym: the thing is we can buff you too.

40
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:06,296
Rym: like if you make enough contacts with us and you're still alive if every one of us gives you like a hundred gold you can start buying military units.

41
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:08,025
Scott: oh yeah everyone give me a hundred gold.

42
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:08,508
Scott: that'd be awesome.

43
00:02:08,527 --> 00:02:13,108
Rym: well I'll I will fund your war to prevent the aggression of this toxic empire.

44
00:02:13,128 --> 00:02:14,093
Rym: I'm expanding.

45
00:02:14,254 --> 00:02:15,240
Scott: I'm totally okay with that.

46
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:15,582
Scott: yeah.

47
00:02:15,682 --> 00:02:16,930
Rym: so just make contact with us.

48
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:17,653
Rym: diplomacy.

49
00:02:17,734 --> 00:02:20,668
Scott: well I finally saw my trireme finally saw someone.

50
00:02:20,688 --> 00:02:21,231
Scott: that's the other thing.

51
00:02:21,271 --> 00:02:21,754
Scott: it's like I always.

52
00:02:22,015 --> 00:02:23,021
Scott: I built this trireme.

53
00:02:23,242 --> 00:02:26,480
Scott: that could have been a military unit that would have defended me but instead.

54
00:02:26,621 --> 00:02:27,647
Scott: oh I know what I'm building.

55
00:02:28,049 --> 00:02:29,856
Scott: I'm one turn away from finishing a wall.

56
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:35,405
Scott: that's actually in my capital but the other city that she's going after doesn't have a wall.

57
00:02:35,587 --> 00:02:35,889
Rym: you know what.

58
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:39,846
Rym: I'm one turn away from finishing the Great Wall because I'm actually.

59
00:02:39,866 --> 00:02:42,278
Rym: I'm not gonna betray anyone in this game.

60
00:02:42,338 --> 00:02:46,979
Rym: you're just gonna have put up a great one but I am terrified that Germany will betray me.

61
00:02:47,521 --> 00:02:53,024
Rym: so just in case I want the Great Wall yeah after I finish the wall I'm gonna build a military.

62
00:02:53,044 --> 00:02:53,948
Rym: yeah finish the wall.

63
00:02:53,968 --> 00:02:57,445
Scott: that is advisable but that's in my capital the city that is surrounded.

64
00:02:57,465 --> 00:03:01,765
Scott: it has no wall but it does have a spear man in it which is okay I guess.

65
00:03:02,327 --> 00:03:08,535
Rym: the other thing is if you get if she takes your city and someone takes it back we can liberate it and bring you back into the game.

66
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,110
Rym: okay which I often do because a lot of that.

67
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,177
Scott: how does that work with GMI?

68
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:17,931
Rym: fuck if I know I'll look into it if it comes to that.

69
00:03:18,794 --> 00:03:22,325
Rym: so that aside I do have not a news but a geek bite.

70
00:03:22,366 --> 00:03:23,148
Rym: so I played a game.

71
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:28,452
Rym: Chris and Anthony really wanted me to play this game and they kept snickering about chicken.

72
00:03:28,472 --> 00:03:31,405
Rym: surprise and this game is called fast food franchise.

73
00:03:32,188 --> 00:03:32,931
Rym: you heard of this game.

74
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:34,275
Scott: I've heard something about it.

75
00:03:34,475 --> 00:03:43,821
Rym: so if I describe this game this game is to monopoly what Madoka Magica is to Sailor Moon.

76
00:03:44,723 --> 00:03:51,240
Rym: okay this game is the ugliest like black and white like it just has these paper cards.

77
00:03:51,621 --> 00:03:52,584
Rym: it's monopoly.

78
00:03:52,604 --> 00:04:05,142
Rym: but it was really interesting to play and I like you roll dice move around the board buy stuff yeah but yeah but what this game?

79
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:06,706
Rym: I gotta play it again.

80
00:04:06,726 --> 00:04:10,177
Scott: what rule is different and it's complicated.

81
00:04:10,277 --> 00:04:19,892
Rym: so basically this is like cutthroat age of just kicks players out of the game and it converges on someone winning real quick.

82
00:04:19,952 --> 00:04:21,858
Rym: like it takes less than an hour to play.

83
00:04:21,878 --> 00:04:24,708
Scott: and what decisions do you make?

84
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:28,846
Rym: so when you land on a spot there's all this other bullshit like crazy.

85
00:04:29,066 --> 00:04:32,902
Rym: there's words all over this crazy black and white board.

86
00:04:32,922 --> 00:04:35,311
Rym: Natalie took one look at this board.

87
00:04:35,332 --> 00:04:37,682
Rym: she was like that game is too ugly for me to even read the rules.

88
00:04:38,547 --> 00:04:48,553
Rym: but so you land on a place right you can open a franchise and there's a limited number of franchises like chicken surprise or I don't remember any of them other than chicken surprise.

89
00:04:48,574 --> 00:04:51,104
Rym: the art is real awesome in this.

90
00:04:51,506 --> 00:04:57,676
Rym: it's almost like kingdom of loathing like it's just a little chicken bucket with a dollar sign on it and some like chicky nubs sticking out of the top.

91
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:07,520
Rym: and if you buy a franchise you then can put it on that monopoly space and then you can start building out franchises of that that franchise because you own it.

92
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,635
Rym: no one else can have it throughout the rest of the country.

93
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:17,137
Rym: so if someone lands on it they owe you based on the number of franchises connected to it.

94
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:27,244
Rym: if you then open another of these like somewhere else in a monopoly space and you connect all the franchises in the middle of the board then they owe you a fuck ton of money.

95
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:30,456
Rym: and there's all this other crazy nonsense going on.

96
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:46,887
Rym: I don't know if it's good I don't know if I necessarily like it but it's much like apocalypse zero is something that is neither good nor likable but is memorable for how how how it it was.

97
00:05:46,907 --> 00:05:51,643
Rym: this thing is the apocalypse zero of monopoly like board games.

98
00:05:52,345 --> 00:05:54,091
Rym: okay I will play it again.

99
00:05:54,111 --> 00:05:56,800
Rym: I think I actually zero again.

100
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:01,177
Rym: I think I. I can see a situation where I would watch apocalypse zero again.

101
00:06:01,197 --> 00:06:06,421
Rym: okay but it would have to be showing it to someone else to see their reactions to it.

102
00:06:06,682 --> 00:06:11,107
Rym: so I want to play this game with you because I really want to see you experiencing this game.

103
00:06:11,127 --> 00:06:12,415
Scott: we could just play monopoly.

104
00:06:12,555 --> 00:06:14,908
Rym: no I will never play monopoly again but I would.

105
00:06:14,929 --> 00:06:16,334
Scott: I have millennia monopoly.

106
00:06:17,618 --> 00:06:18,802
Rym: I saw that ponyopoly.

107
00:06:19,384 --> 00:06:26,209
Rym: I would play fast food franchise again and I don't know what else I can say about it other than that it could.

108
00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:29,763
Rym: that made me question what it is that I seek when I play games.

109
00:06:30,185 --> 00:06:32,514
Rym: mmm interesting situation here.

110
00:06:33,016 --> 00:06:34,363
Rym: so you gotta got a gaming news.

111
00:06:34,684 --> 00:06:35,548
Scott: it's sort of a news.

112
00:06:35,668 --> 00:06:38,701
Scott: really got three things of the day and one of them is passable as news.

113
00:06:39,143 --> 00:06:44,300
Scott: so it was revealed or discovered recently like within the past.

114
00:06:44,661 --> 00:06:54,321
Scott: Oh week right there is something in punch out that people did not know or at least I guess I'm sure someone on earth knows the person who might like a technique or something.

115
00:06:54,502 --> 00:06:56,352
Scott: no so you know how.

116
00:06:56,472 --> 00:07:00,332
Scott: again certain guys there's a moment where you can punch them and they will go down.

117
00:07:00,513 --> 00:07:01,475
Scott: just do the one punch.

118
00:07:01,636 --> 00:07:05,888
Scott: yeah right right so did you know?

119
00:07:06,148 --> 00:07:07,836
Scott: usually you sort of get the feel of like.

120
00:07:07,917 --> 00:07:14,607
Scott: okay it's on some bald bulls third bounce like do to do to do to punch right you just you get and that's how most people play now.

121
00:07:15,691 --> 00:07:24,069
Scott: it was revealed in 2009 by Iwata of all people right that there is a part.

122
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:31,760
Scott: in the first time you fight bald bull the time that you're supposed to punch him a camera flash goes off in the on the crowd.

123
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:35,232
Scott: whoa this is in 2009. this is revealed.

124
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:41,926
Rym: I I guess I'm not up on the current state of the art and Mike Tyson's in 2009 they revealed this that there's a camera flash.

125
00:07:41,987 --> 00:07:42,610
Rym: oh my god it's.

126
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,257
Rym: that tells you beard right there.

127
00:07:44,277 --> 00:07:47,149
Scott: it tells you when to punch a ball bowl.

128
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:53,491
Scott: so the thing that was just discovered was that for piston Honda right first piston Honda.

129
00:07:53,511 --> 00:07:54,355
Rym: second piston Honda.

130
00:07:55,258 --> 00:07:57,929
Scott: I think it's the second piston.

131
00:07:57,969 --> 00:08:01,463
Scott: second Honda right and also the second ball bowl.

132
00:08:01,744 --> 00:08:04,518
Scott: there's a guy in the crowd where the looks like he has a beard.

133
00:08:04,578 --> 00:08:05,584
Scott: he's just a few pixels.

134
00:08:05,624 --> 00:08:08,679
Rym: I see him beard definitely a bit at the moment you're supposed to punch.

135
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:15,165
Scott: he sort of like nods his head like mmm or like or shakes his head or does he doesn't?

136
00:08:15,206 --> 00:08:24,702
Scott: some kind of animation to signal the exact moment you should punch either second ball bowlers or a second piston Honda to get the one hit knocked out on them.

137
00:08:25,143 --> 00:08:27,310
Scott: wow this was just discovered.

138
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:27,712
Scott: I haven't.

139
00:08:28,215 --> 00:08:31,009
Scott: I didn't know it before and I don't know anyone who knew it before.

140
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:32,714
Rym: and holy shit.

141
00:08:32,754 --> 00:08:33,840
Rym: does that read that?

142
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,337
Rym: it means that the em because remember Mike Tyson's punch-out uses that mmc2 chip?

143
00:08:37,357 --> 00:08:38,644
Rym: I think is the only game that used it.

144
00:08:39,107 --> 00:08:44,430
Rym: because so and it was because it had to be able to have that crowd and the two giant dudes.

145
00:08:45,991 --> 00:08:49,265
Rym: this could only have been done with the mmc2 chip.

146
00:08:49,566 --> 00:08:56,678
Rym: well yeah the whole game can only be yeah but like the fact that they used the crowd for something beyond this this is kind of messing with me.

147
00:08:56,698 --> 00:09:00,637
Scott: well I mean the flash was known this the nodding guy was unknown.

148
00:09:00,837 --> 00:09:02,083
Rym: what else don't we know?

149
00:09:02,243 --> 00:09:03,328
Scott: what else don't we know?

150
00:09:03,368 --> 00:09:06,581
Scott: so now I'm gonna get some videos of some fights against.

151
00:09:07,123 --> 00:09:08,790
Scott: you know Tyson himself and see.

152
00:09:09,373 --> 00:09:11,866
Scott: is there perhaps some sort of signal in the back?

153
00:09:11,946 --> 00:09:20,662
Scott: I'm sure people are already investigating that you could use to perhaps take him down more reliably because even the best people have some hard times.

154
00:09:21,826 --> 00:09:25,060
Rym: I've watched a few failed even though every every speed run.

155
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,591
Scott: I've seen blindfold speed runs beating him now.

156
00:09:27,672 --> 00:09:29,740
Scott: so that just shows how bad I I mean.

157
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,154
Scott: I could beat everyone up to Sandman and super macho man.

158
00:09:33,174 --> 00:09:33,717
Scott: that's about it.

159
00:09:33,757 --> 00:09:35,244
Scott: I can't have a hard time with them.

160
00:09:35,265 --> 00:09:37,498
Rym: I could play a Mike Tyson's punch-out again.

161
00:09:37,518 --> 00:09:38,062
Rym: it's been a while.

162
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:38,726
Scott: it's a good game.

163
00:09:38,908 --> 00:09:47,566
Rym: it's got one more weird news because this is this is I don't know what to make of this except that it's gamergate esque but it's not the gamergate people doing it.

164
00:09:47,948 --> 00:09:51,649
Scott: okay so people are harassing someone for a reason other than sexism or what.

165
00:09:51,669 --> 00:09:56,750
Rym: so there's that slash tabletop game which is like slash two characters together.

166
00:09:57,011 --> 00:09:58,599
Rym: some some people we know made it.

167
00:09:59,021 --> 00:10:00,428
Rym: that's a good game for that sort of thing.

168
00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:10,160
Rym: yeah but apparently some of the cards mention characters from a particular franchise and have a little bit of description about them.

169
00:10:10,321 --> 00:10:12,412
Scott: well I mean a lot of games have that.

170
00:10:12,472 --> 00:10:15,528
Scott: like you know this is like the super fight game and they got.

171
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:16,553
Scott: yeah they got a new game.

172
00:10:16,654 --> 00:10:16,835
Scott: the

173
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:45,057
Rym: franchise they mention happens to be a franchise filled with nothing but ridiculous shithead fans who are so butter about the slightly biased and they get real into the ethics and the bias that this game presents about these characters that they have organized a massive down review bad review reporting campaign against this game trying to get as many people as possible and they're success.

174
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:52,929
Rym: not that popular a game yeah but the number of people who are trying to destroy this game now is ridiculous.

175
00:10:53,009 --> 00:10:56,784
Scott: it's five people who are way more than 100 internet accounts?

176
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,893
Rym: no so what does the franchise?

177
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:14,660
Rym: is this dumb TV show called supernatural which I'm not I don't even know much about it okay but it's fans are the most butthurt people I've ever seen on earth and the reviews that they're writing are all and there's lots of them here are all basically the same.

178
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:23,153
Rym: they're mad that the people who made the game so unprofessionally talked about the characters that they like in a way that they don't like.

179
00:11:23,173 --> 00:11:26,865
Rym: okay and this is like.

180
00:11:26,925 --> 00:11:28,993
Rym: you should see how many of these reviews there are.

181
00:11:29,013 --> 00:11:44,112
Rym: they're still growing like they're organized in their attempt to destroy this game because they're so butter about the fact that a little bit of text in the middle of this obscure indie game says something about a character dating another character in this relatively unpopular franchise TV show.

182
00:11:44,132 --> 00:11:45,457
Rym: and they're.

183
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:46,602
Rym: this is the result.

184
00:11:46,642 --> 00:11:49,614
Rym: this is like gamergate but supernatural fans only.

185
00:11:49,634 --> 00:11:52,387
Scott: whatever I mean this is every day on the internet.

186
00:11:52,407 --> 00:11:53,029
Scott: what's the big deal?

187
00:11:53,492 --> 00:11:54,115
Rym: uh this is.

188
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,985
Rym: this is an example of this happening.

189
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:59,782
Scott: I don't think people really like 30 of these every day.

190
00:11:59,842 --> 00:12:00,846
Rym: name one instance of this.

191
00:12:00,866 --> 00:12:01,670
Rym: that isn't gamergate.

192
00:12:02,653 --> 00:12:04,118
Scott: they're all kpop related ones.

193
00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:10,605
Scott: okay so-and-so posted pictures on their Instagram kissing their boyfriend and everyone's mad.

194
00:12:10,665 --> 00:12:14,123
Rym: so and so there's a difference between mad general like this.

195
00:12:14,163 --> 00:12:16,535
Rym: is the because this happens on reddit the downvote brigades.

196
00:12:16,816 --> 00:12:24,432
Rym: this is organized people trying to destroy the reviews of something like a restaurant just to make it go away because they're mad about the contents.

197
00:12:24,612 --> 00:12:37,469
Scott: should I tell you the time that people went to the girls generation concert and everyone turned off their light sticks and turn their backs to the stage that's actually amazing because they were talking to dude idols.

198
00:12:37,609 --> 00:12:39,517
Rym: oh yeah the people are horrible people.

199
00:12:39,557 --> 00:12:44,697
Rym: but that that level of organization is amazing yeah I'm just saying so.

200
00:12:44,717 --> 00:12:48,450
Scott: yeah this shit happens every day in every single right.

201
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:54,334
Scott: that's just one fandom right every single fandom that involves at people under the age of 30.

202
00:12:54,334 --> 00:13:04,258
Rym: so the reason I bring this up is that you can actually go to the Amazon reviews and report these reviews as being fraudulent and Amazon will do something about it.

203
00:13:04,641 --> 00:13:06,412
Rym: so it's kind of helping out some friends here.

204
00:13:06,472 --> 00:13:07,860
Rym: you can go help them with this.

205
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,705
Scott: what's the I mean?

206
00:13:08,906 --> 00:13:11,175
Scott: what's the current rating of the game on Amazon?

207
00:13:11,517 --> 00:13:14,727
Rym: four stars for now very effective.

208
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:17,401
Rym: well because it takes a while to get the momentum up.

209
00:13:17,683 --> 00:13:28,473
Rym: also it looks like the reviews are starting to be deleted because people are trying to undo the tide but this is related to this was something I was going to talk about on a Monday but it's relevant to this.

210
00:13:29,457 --> 00:13:38,194
Rym: this same thing just happens well has been happening and someone did a news article about it to some random-ass farm in the middle of Kansas a farm.

211
00:13:38,394 --> 00:13:38,715
Scott: yeah.

212
00:13:38,775 --> 00:13:50,758
Rym: so the story is way back in 2002 there was some service that I guess would tell you like hey based on an IP address here's where the shithead you're mad about lives or you know.

213
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,267
Rym: look up where an IP address is now.

214
00:13:53,328 --> 00:13:55,816
Rym: back then that information was not like.

215
00:13:56,137 --> 00:14:07,099
Rym: there was no good people dynamic IPS and shit - oh so basically what this guy did what the service did is if it couldn't tell where you were other than that you're in the US.

216
00:14:07,601 --> 00:14:20,587
Rym: it just put a dot in the geographic center of the country give or take and it hard-coded where that dot was and it just happens that that dot is the front yard of some farm.

217
00:14:20,868 --> 00:14:24,662
Scott: just that some people lives in the exact center of the United States.

218
00:14:24,762 --> 00:14:29,203
Rym: yeah so remember how an American God saw the center of the United States is the worst place in the world.

219
00:14:29,384 --> 00:14:35,110
Rym: yes the internet for the last two decades has made this the worst place in the world.

220
00:14:35,511 --> 00:14:45,889
Rym: death threats harassment IRS collectors basically all the shit and debris of the internet has coalesced around this one farm and it's ruined it for these people.

221
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:51,371
Scott: hey I mean it would be one thing if like they can't like a cute sign put there or like.

222
00:14:51,411 --> 00:14:59,374
Rym: no this is like someone get like someone gets ripped off on the internet and they try to look up the IP address person who ripped him off and they see oh it's that farm.

223
00:14:59,394 --> 00:15:02,804
Rym: hmm that scam farm.

224
00:15:02,864 --> 00:15:14,559
Rym: people were starting to think that there was like a scam operation running out of that farm and they're like doing investigative journalism except they don't know shit about shit and it's just literally someone's family farm.

225
00:15:14,921 --> 00:15:15,302
Rym: people.

226
00:15:15,322 --> 00:15:19,339
Rym: a lot of debt collectors would come around police would come around.

227
00:15:19,641 --> 00:15:20,626
Rym: this shit is ridiculous.

228
00:15:20,646 --> 00:15:25,569
Scott: the moral of all of this don't leave the farm is that in the modern era move the farm like you got.

229
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,520
Scott: probably have a ton of fucking land.

230
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,225
Scott: you live in a farm.

231
00:15:28,265 --> 00:15:28,909
Scott: pick your house up.

232
00:15:28,949 --> 00:15:30,015
Scott: move it to the other end of the farm.

233
00:15:30,619 --> 00:15:32,349
Rym: yeah but that's not the correct solution.

234
00:15:32,409 --> 00:15:48,228
Rym: the problem is that in the modern era if you call attention to anything at all slightly more so than the things around it people will put literal poop all over that thing and gamergate is just the sort of recent iteration of that.

235
00:15:48,349 --> 00:15:49,955
Scott: so like I think it's the one.

236
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:58,687
Scott: I think it's one that is perhaps doing more damage and also one that is being fought against more and it's also longer lasting.

237
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:11,647
Rym: well it's also like surprisingly organized but it's interesting because the gamergate nonsense is very like very tightly organized by shitheads like we will get together in anonymous forums to coordinate being shitheads together.

238
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:13,937
Rym: but this is literally random.

239
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:14,961
Rym: there's no worry.

240
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:29,061
Rym: this is just because some GPS coordinates showed up in a database with no other context and that the same gamer giddy shit happened by a collective group of people who don't know each other and are not organized in any way.

241
00:16:29,081 --> 00:16:32,294
Scott: I mean standalone complex is already like way old.

242
00:16:32,354 --> 00:16:37,736
Rym: yeah wait oh I get in the forum who has kept posting gamergate shit and finally got caught.

243
00:16:37,756 --> 00:16:40,708
Scott: I don't really pay that much time.

244
00:16:40,808 --> 00:16:47,022
Rym: oh so basically someone posted like an article that was kind of bullshitty and everyone was like dude that's some gamergate bullshit.

245
00:16:47,043 --> 00:16:47,849
Rym: he's like oh shit I didn't.

246
00:16:47,869 --> 00:17:00,308
Rym: I just linked to it because I'm sorry and then basically I realized that this person kept posting things that were that gamergate nonsense but then when called out on it and actually did some investigative journalism.

247
00:17:00,328 --> 00:17:03,460
Rym: the response was always oh I guess I should check my sources better.

248
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:08,232
Rym: whoops so can't pull that trick more than once in the same forum dude.

249
00:17:13,617 --> 00:17:16,440
Rym: but anyway things of the day.

250
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,103
Rym: what yeah for me.

251
00:17:17,928 --> 00:17:18,410
Scott: I forget what.

252
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,335
Scott: I sent you two links.

253
00:17:19,356 --> 00:17:21,064
Scott: I forget which one I'm gonna use on this episode.

254
00:17:21,084 --> 00:17:22,752
Scott: let's figure it out.

255
00:17:22,771 --> 00:17:25,222
Rym: first one all right all right you got anything cuz I got.

256
00:17:25,343 --> 00:17:34,583
Scott: the first one is ah yes somebody went into I guess the supermarket or something and they left the dog in the car with the window cracked open.

257
00:17:34,623 --> 00:17:42,747
Rym: but you can't that's still not safe yeah but the actually crack in the window has almost no effect on the temperature window the windows significantly open.

258
00:17:42,868 --> 00:17:48,113
Rym: even then it doesn't have a significant impact and if it's open enough to make an impact the dog and probably just jump out.

259
00:17:49,339 --> 00:17:51,589
Scott: what I'm saying is though that part doesn't matter.

260
00:17:51,649 --> 00:18:04,236
Scott: the part that matters is the dog clearly knows that this isn't a good situation and it you know it decides to try to get the owners attention to for the great benefit of YouTube.

261
00:18:04,698 --> 00:18:06,526
Rym: oh I actually have not watched this.

262
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:08,536
Rym: it's well it's just called.

263
00:18:08,596 --> 00:18:09,320
Rym: I'll click on it later.

264
00:18:09,601 --> 00:18:13,858
Rym: it's just called impatient pups left alone in car for their owners.

265
00:18:13,898 --> 00:18:14,882
Rym: oh I see what happens.

266
00:18:15,504 --> 00:18:16,106
Rym: smart dogs.

267
00:18:16,267 --> 00:18:17,451
Scott: it's way cute this dog.

268
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:21,826
Rym: I'm into this cute dog so I don't link to these all the time.

269
00:18:21,906 --> 00:18:34,327
Rym: but I'm actually deeply impressed with the people who are taking the music to undertale which is already great music and just doing like amazing covers of it like taking the song and remixing it doing stuff to it just covering it.

270
00:18:34,388 --> 00:18:39,505
Scott: someone posted covers of the you know me me Tomo songs.

271
00:18:39,545 --> 00:18:39,987
Scott: yeah.

272
00:18:40,047 --> 00:18:42,638
Scott: so I mean if you make a song someone will cover.

273
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:47,524
Rym: yeah this is one of my favorite things about modern internet culture but this one goes above and beyond.

274
00:18:47,564 --> 00:18:52,809
Rym: so there's a song in Undertale called bone trousel which is the bone guys the skeleton bros and it's a great song.

275
00:18:53,692 --> 00:18:56,682
Rym: someone uploaded and it's on YouTube now.

276
00:18:57,144 --> 00:18:58,187
Rym: bone klezmer.

277
00:18:58,207 --> 00:19:01,396
Rym: okay it's a klezmer cover of this song.

278
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:07,134
Rym: it is so perfect and so wonderful that I can't get it out of my head.

279
00:19:07,696 --> 00:19:11,328
Scott: I mean klezmer is skeletons second favorite kind of music genre.

280
00:19:11,369 --> 00:19:15,543
Rym: yeah and in fact they posted it on Halloween.

281
00:19:15,563 --> 00:19:17,028
Rym: good job.

282
00:19:17,088 --> 00:19:22,566
Rym: yeah in the meta moment the booklet book will be oryx and crake by Margaret Atwood.

283
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:26,963
Rym: oryx with a Y not orcs like grar hitting you with a club or whatever.

284
00:19:26,983 --> 00:19:30,114
Rym: I guess it works mostly your swords axes.

285
00:19:30,555 --> 00:19:32,843
Rym: yeah axes swords spanking clubs.

286
00:19:32,863 --> 00:19:43,384
Rym: they're not trollex and I'm probably gonna stop reading the real-time temporarily now that I'm finishing up book 12 and stuff stopped happening.

287
00:19:43,425 --> 00:19:43,626
Rym: they were.

288
00:19:43,908 --> 00:19:48,276
Rym: it got to this point where they're like hey remember that tower the tower that has all the obvious cool shit in where.

289
00:19:48,316 --> 00:19:50,668
Scott: that's the only thing I want to know about good character.

290
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:55,696
Rym: all but literally said to another character you can't go there yet dude you're not high enough level.

291
00:19:55,857 --> 00:19:57,285
Rym: and now they're finally high enough level.

292
00:19:57,305 --> 00:19:59,474
Rym: that got mentioned.

293
00:19:59,595 --> 00:20:01,723
Rym: and then a whole book later no one's going over to the tower.

294
00:20:02,185 --> 00:20:05,515
Rym: so pause we're gonna pause.

295
00:20:06,298 --> 00:20:07,905
Rym: but another interesting thing happened.

296
00:20:07,965 --> 00:20:11,040
Scott: so we were watch book 13 is nothing but the tower.

297
00:20:11,261 --> 00:20:21,229
Rym: yeah I'll get back to it I think when you read oryx and crake first though because that is the actual book club book the patreon the next patreon actually jumped way ahead.

298
00:20:21,309 --> 00:20:24,222
Rym: suddenly what's wrong with you people on a new patreon jet?

299
00:20:24,263 --> 00:20:33,954
Scott: listen instead of doing some patreon nonsense just send your money to me and then I will spend it on chocolate.

300
00:20:34,155 --> 00:20:36,502
Rym: why don't you make a competing patreon for that?

301
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:40,056
Rym: no cuz then people can send you the money directly.

302
00:20:40,076 --> 00:20:45,457
Scott: yeah my patreon will say every money you give to me you will get nothing in return.

303
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:49,140
Rym: you could say that just put up a video saying I'm gonna spend all this money on chocolate.

304
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,525
Scott: oh that would be giving them a video.

305
00:20:53,196 --> 00:20:54,601
Rym: see at least they're getting something with my pit.

306
00:20:54,621 --> 00:20:55,845
Rym: well our patreon.

307
00:20:56,125 --> 00:21:03,728
Rym: so anyway it jumped way up and it was a dollar short of the goal to actually do something.

308
00:21:04,671 --> 00:21:07,078
Rym: so no jump past the goal and it's done.

309
00:21:07,098 --> 00:21:10,134
Rym: and even if it drops below the goal I'm fucked and I have to do it.

310
00:21:10,255 --> 00:21:24,141
Rym: so over the next few weeks I'm going to remaster listen to make commentary for and publish on the patreon all eight or possibly nine of the beta episodes of GeekNights.

311
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:29,099
Rym: that we did in October of 2005 before we officially launched.

312
00:21:29,219 --> 00:21:30,386
Scott: how do you commentary?

313
00:21:30,406 --> 00:21:31,029
Scott: an audio track.

314
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:33,604
Scott: it's just like listening to an extra person talk at the hope.

315
00:21:33,866 --> 00:21:38,309
Rym: so what I'm actually gonna do is one I'm remastering them which is actually really fucking hard.

316
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:43,257
Rym: I posted a thing yesterday about how hard it is to fix these audio files because they're so old and busted.

317
00:21:43,277 --> 00:21:48,163
Rym: we didn't know shit back then but and we had terrible equipment especially for the beta episodes.

318
00:21:48,485 --> 00:21:50,736
Rym: we actually bought a lot of equipment before we went live.

319
00:21:50,756 --> 00:21:51,419
Rym: legit guys.

320
00:21:53,322 --> 00:22:00,189
Rym: so but I'm gonna listen to them and then I'm going to basically preface them with an explanation and commentary on Park style.

321
00:22:00,249 --> 00:22:07,441
Rym: yeah because I don't have an hour's worth of things to say about us haltingly talking about what we're gonna do.

322
00:22:07,461 --> 00:22:27,539
Rym: GeekNights sound for an hour in 2005. so the heart the weird thing is I listen to the whole first episode just to kind of like see what I was getting into and it was really interesting because I don't remember being like that nor do I remember that era of my life that well 2005 is further ago than you think.

323
00:22:28,122 --> 00:22:31,419
Rym: I remember Scott's a lot more enthusiastic and I'm a lot more blase.

324
00:22:31,439 --> 00:22:33,487
Rym: it was my idea yeah and with.

325
00:22:33,568 --> 00:22:35,917
Rym: but no you're more enthusiastic about life back then.

326
00:22:36,881 --> 00:22:37,705
Rym: you're into shit.

327
00:22:37,946 --> 00:22:41,562
Rym: we talked about politics and you talked about politics a lot.

328
00:22:41,842 --> 00:22:43,606
Rym: yeah what's it?

329
00:22:43,626 --> 00:22:44,067
Rym: what happened?

330
00:22:44,528 --> 00:22:45,089
Rym: what changed?

331
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:46,593
Scott: I became smarter.

332
00:22:48,336 --> 00:22:53,394
Scott: so uh yeah how much how much how much affected my talking happened in ten years?

333
00:22:54,197 --> 00:22:54,438
Scott: none.

334
00:22:54,458 --> 00:23:00,343
Rym: so over the next few weeks if you're a patreon subscriber and it's gonna be amazing.

335
00:23:00,624 --> 00:23:04,338
Rym: but I have to warn you guys these are beta episodes.

336
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:05,925
Rym: I want to be very clear about that.

337
00:23:06,387 --> 00:23:13,013
Rym: if you like GeekNights today or you've liked the last decade of GeekNights these are the precursor to it.

338
00:23:13,194 --> 00:23:14,157
Rym: they are not it.

339
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:18,692
Rym: they are shockingly poorly done in some situations.

340
00:23:19,354 --> 00:23:22,606
Scott: I mean see have you ever read the first penny arcade comic?

341
00:23:23,329 --> 00:23:24,615
Rym: yeah it's actually not funny.

342
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:25,840
Scott: I mean they are.

343
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,241
Scott: granted.

344
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:27,445
Rym: the third one was really funny.

345
00:23:27,485 --> 00:23:28,609
Rym: and then have you looked at it?

346
00:23:28,649 --> 00:23:29,091
Scott: yeah yeah.

347
00:23:32,182 --> 00:23:33,086
Rym: and penny arcade yeah.

348
00:23:33,226 --> 00:23:34,371
Rym: so think of these.

349
00:23:34,432 --> 00:23:35,094
Rym: think of it this way.

350
00:23:35,114 --> 00:23:35,175
Rym: the.

351
00:23:35,838 --> 00:23:43,931
Rym: the audio quality and commentary quality of early GeekNights is similar to the artistic quality of the drawings in the early penny arcades.

352
00:23:44,674 --> 00:23:47,308
Scott: so last but not least you mean the most important thing.

353
00:23:47,348 --> 00:23:49,059
Scott: you were about to forget and continue on to the.

354
00:23:50,202 --> 00:23:51,710
Rym: No one has any proof of that.

355
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,278
Rym: I could edit this whole thing out but I won't.

356
00:23:54,461 --> 00:23:59,563
Rym: PAX East is not this weekend but it is motherfucking next weekend and we are gonna be there.

357
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:10,200
Rym: I'm actually really pumped about this PAX East because one it's the one PAX we enforce that and actually enforcing is really fun like it's the one thing that makes PAX East really stand out from all the other.

358
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,435
Rym: PAX is just as us going because it's the only PAX we do.

359
00:24:13,556 --> 00:24:19,076
Rym: that it's like this whole extra dimension to a PAX because otherwise it's got less going on.

360
00:24:19,097 --> 00:24:20,401
Rym: yeah it's.

361
00:24:20,964 --> 00:24:25,424
Rym: I'm not gonna lie PAX East is my least favorite PAX cuz it's the most expensive.

362
00:24:25,485 --> 00:24:26,370
Scott: it's a pain in the ass.

363
00:24:26,411 --> 00:24:27,719
Rym: well it's the second most expensive.

364
00:24:27,739 --> 00:24:27,880
Rym: packs.

365
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,467
Rym: Australia is the most expensive.

366
00:24:29,648 --> 00:24:32,682
Rym: sure right it's the most pain in the ass by far.

367
00:24:33,044 --> 00:24:34,491
Scott: it's because I get to Boston.

368
00:24:34,531 --> 00:24:35,938
Scott: it sucks to get a hotel room.

369
00:24:35,978 --> 00:24:37,505
Scott: the building is not comfortable.

370
00:24:37,665 --> 00:24:46,348
Rym: yep Boston forces packs have bag checks and while they're not nearly as horrific as the ones at the Heinz that anime Boston has to deal with they're not pleasant.

371
00:24:46,649 --> 00:24:53,839
Rym: and in fact if I didn't enforce and have a way to literally not go through those security checks I might stop going to PAX East.

372
00:24:56,383 --> 00:24:59,662
Rym: but it is a pax and let me tell you you know we talked about how it's the worst pax.

373
00:25:00,084 --> 00:25:02,816
Rym: that's like saying it's the worst of the scallops.

374
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:05,245
Rym: at the fancy scallop this is the least tasty.

375
00:25:05,285 --> 00:25:06,249
Scott: filet mignon.

376
00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:07,393
Scott: yeah this restaurant.

377
00:25:07,574 --> 00:25:13,436
Rym: yeah of this of this amazing shellfish sushi from the greatest sushi chef in Japan.

378
00:25:13,456 --> 00:25:15,645
Rym: this is his least inspired one.

379
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,114
Rym: so we're gonna be there.

380
00:25:18,334 --> 00:25:21,226
Rym: we're doing a tari game design on Sunday at 3 30 p.m.

381
00:25:21,246 --> 00:25:22,089
Rym: in the arachnid theater.

382
00:25:22,531 --> 00:25:29,857
Rym: also the omega-thon at this pax east might be the greatest omega-thon lineup I have ever seen.

383
00:25:29,877 --> 00:25:33,432
Rym: mm-hmm it's knit hog but it's not just knit hog.

384
00:25:33,552 --> 00:25:34,777
Scott: wait how isn't pax?

385
00:25:34,817 --> 00:25:36,684
Scott: he's supposed to be the co-op omega-thon.

386
00:25:36,885 --> 00:25:38,490
Rym: it's co-op knit hog.

387
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:39,454
Scott: that's not possible.

388
00:25:39,654 --> 00:25:42,243
Rym: two players one controller.

389
00:25:42,504 --> 00:25:43,347
Scott: is that what it says?

390
00:25:43,548 --> 00:25:44,953
Rym: that's what I was told.

391
00:25:44,973 --> 00:25:46,980
Scott: I don't believe that.

392
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,932
Scott: I thought that was just someone making an offhand comment.

393
00:25:49,052 --> 00:25:50,742
Rym: I heard that's what it's gonna be.

394
00:25:50,762 --> 00:25:53,474
Scott: I heard that was basically just somebody being like.

395
00:25:53,977 --> 00:25:56,972
Scott: I said that it's co-op and someone was like oh maybe to p1c.

396
00:25:57,253 --> 00:25:58,861
Rym: someone posted that in a different place.

397
00:25:58,901 --> 00:25:59,524
Rym: so we'll see.

398
00:25:59,665 --> 00:26:00,769
Scott: I think I was looking at a different forum.

399
00:26:00,789 --> 00:26:03,822
Rym: might have been the same person.

400
00:26:03,842 --> 00:26:05,069
Rym: that person's in both forums.

401
00:26:05,954 --> 00:26:07,160
Scott: but that's how rumors start.

402
00:26:07,261 --> 00:26:13,235
Scott: someone just has an idea like that a plausible explanation for actually so I heard and then someone believes it as if it's some true thing.

403
00:26:13,255 --> 00:26:22,674
Rym: so I heard that the omega-thon finale finale is going to be first video ball and then the literal agro crag and then Megumi Hashibara is gonna perform.

404
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:24,020
Scott: I'm buying the video ball.

405
00:26:24,181 --> 00:26:27,757
Scott: video ball is actually so here's some other pax east news.

406
00:26:27,777 --> 00:26:32,483
Scott: the pax east news number one video ball is gonna be there as they have been at every pax for a few years now.

407
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:35,856
Scott: but video balls very close to being released.

408
00:26:36,197 --> 00:26:42,950
Scott: he's been like writing descriptions for like to be posted on steam with the game and stuff like that and you might think why does the 2d?

409
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:51,704
Scott: I heard that he's bringing a ginormous television for video ball larger than any before and also has video ball shirts now.

410
00:26:52,446 --> 00:26:53,992
Scott: so video ball is like imminent.

411
00:26:54,754 --> 00:27:02,562
Scott: also other very important pax east news on Thursday before pax begins usually you want to play some games.

412
00:27:02,602 --> 00:27:03,507
Scott: that's how pax goes.

413
00:27:03,587 --> 00:27:04,854
Scott: any pax anywhere on earth.

414
00:27:05,115 --> 00:27:19,526
Scott: before pax starts you play games but it's kind of hard to play games at pax east beforehand because the only place you can go is like this little circle tables that are sort of on this mezzanine in the in the hotel the Westin and it's not a lot of space and it's usually crowded.

415
00:27:19,546 --> 00:27:27,486
Scott: and actually this year there's some kind of event taking up all the tables and the tables down in the bar area aren't comfortable and you gotta buy a drink or whatever it sucks.

416
00:27:27,506 --> 00:27:43,239
Scott: so somebody arranged with the hotel somehow that there is some very large space some ballroom in the Westin that is unused and it will be opened with many tables specifically for gaming.

417
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:53,502
Scott: so much so in fact that if they see you gaming elsewhere they're gonna tell you to go there and that's gonna probably make it the best pre packs gaming that there is.

418
00:27:53,522 --> 00:27:58,402
Scott: yep and because there's some like manager at the hotel like arrange this.

419
00:27:58,864 --> 00:28:06,141
Scott: they want to like thank this person because it's like a miracle of odd miracles that like a very expensive hotel event space is being given for free.

420
00:28:06,161 --> 00:28:21,281
Scott: so they made an indie go-go thing to collect money to buy a gift for this hotel version is amazing and hopefully that will make the hotel person be even nicer in the future and maybe give us some free catering to go with our free table now

421
00:28:21,341 --> 00:28:24,310
Rym: if only any pecs attendees were staying at the Westin.

422
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:29,791
Rym: but the omegathon lineup round one is lifted.

423
00:28:29,811 --> 00:28:31,058
Scott: I don't know what that is.

424
00:28:31,198 --> 00:28:35,380
Rym: that's that board game where you wear that the hat with the crane sticking out of the front.

425
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,274
Rym: I've got a movement manipulate stuff on the board.

426
00:28:37,294 --> 00:28:37,939
Scott: I've never seen this.

427
00:28:37,959 --> 00:28:38,964
Rym: you've really never seen lifted.

428
00:28:39,065 --> 00:28:39,728
Scott: I've never seen.

429
00:28:39,849 --> 00:28:41,115
Rym: it's an amazing looking game.

430
00:28:41,618 --> 00:28:41,899
Rym: around.

431
00:28:41,939 --> 00:28:43,163
Rym: two is star wall.

432
00:28:43,585 --> 00:28:44,929
Rym: round three is the knit hog.

433
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:52,356
Rym: so this is the one omegathon that I could have made it to the end like legit like without anyone stopping.

434
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,444
Scott: it's not bionic commando kaboom.

435
00:28:55,925 --> 00:28:57,969
Rym: yeah the final round is advanced wars.

436
00:28:58,009 --> 00:28:58,911
Rym: that's the Rym.

437
00:29:03,901 --> 00:29:04,564
Scott: the Rym a thon.

438
00:29:04,604 --> 00:29:05,247
Rym: yeah the Rym a thon.

439
00:29:05,267 --> 00:29:06,554
Rym: DDR could be mixed in there.

440
00:29:06,634 --> 00:29:08,785
Rym: sure I'm so almost.

441
00:29:08,845 --> 00:29:10,593
Rym: I can almost do max 300 again.

442
00:29:10,613 --> 00:29:15,190
Rym: I actually been practicing it like every day to try to prove that I'm not so old that I'm dead.

443
00:29:16,695 --> 00:29:18,562
Rym: and I've gotten back to the point.

444
00:29:18,582 --> 00:29:23,389
Rym: so the first half of the song you know it has like the first half and then there's like that pause and then it just kills you.

445
00:29:23,409 --> 00:29:30,961
Rym: I can do the entire first half without missing a step reliably despite being thirty fucking four years old.

446
00:29:31,223 --> 00:29:39,623
Rym: mm-hmm I cannot make it more than halfway through the second half without literally like almost like almost passing out like falling off breathing so heavily.

447
00:29:39,663 --> 00:29:40,627
Rym: it sounds like I'm gonna die.

448
00:29:40,648 --> 00:29:42,014
Rym: I might just be too old.

449
00:29:42,034 --> 00:29:44,224
Rym: it might be that shit might have sailed.

450
00:29:45,227 --> 00:29:47,637
Rym: so we actually debated what.

451
00:29:47,717 --> 00:29:56,299
Rym: do you could make an argument a shitty argument in some cases but an argument on the last that the meat of Nintendo's me Tomo could be talked about in any of the four days.

452
00:29:56,801 --> 00:30:00,495
Rym: sure and it technically does have a game in it.

453
00:30:00,515 --> 00:30:08,764
Rym: it has me drop where you throw the knees down to get stuff and it is at least as much of a game as candy box sure.

454
00:30:08,784 --> 00:30:10,594
Rym: so I guess Tuesday is the best day to talk about it.

455
00:30:10,614 --> 00:30:11,679
Rym: it's a Nintendo thing.

456
00:30:11,699 --> 00:30:16,546
Scott: I think the gaming audience cares the most about the me Tomo more than the tech audience of the anime audience?

457
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:20,082
Rym: yeah so but also I mean yeah Monday show people.

458
00:30:20,142 --> 00:30:20,946
Rym: they don't care about it.

459
00:30:21,047 --> 00:30:25,408
Rym: it's basically like Nintendo snapchat plus candy box Thursday people.

460
00:30:25,428 --> 00:30:27,458
Rym: I guess we can really use Thursday shows.

461
00:30:27,478 --> 00:30:32,884
Scott: so if I were to work there better for us maybe all right let me tell them oh it's Nintendo's first.

462
00:30:32,944 --> 00:30:38,989
Scott: it's the first ever official mobile app made by Nintendo that is free for everyone to get.

463
00:30:39,009 --> 00:30:44,515
Scott: and you know they had that puzzle dragons Mario thing but I think that was actually on 3ds.

464
00:30:44,596 --> 00:30:47,108
Scott: I don't know if it was ever on phones or anything but anyway.

465
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,053
Scott: so what is me?

466
00:30:48,093 --> 00:30:48,435
Scott: Tomo?

467
00:30:48,475 --> 00:30:53,716
Scott: me Tomo is the social networks or like Twitter but it doesn't work that way.

468
00:30:53,756 --> 00:30:54,439
Scott: here's how it works.

469
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:57,014
Scott: first you make a me obviously if you don't already have me

470
00:30:57,296 --> 00:31:01,330
Rym: and it appears that this is now like your me to be to end all me's

471
00:31:01,752 --> 00:31:09,235
Scott: maybe anyway you make a me and your me is hanging out in this room that you can't customize at all which I think they're definitely gonna let you customize that room.

472
00:31:09,276 --> 00:31:09,800
Scott: it's yeah they are.

473
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:10,967
Rym: it's a really ugly room.

474
00:31:11,007 --> 00:31:15,112
Scott: right now though you can customize the clothes on your me but you need to buy clothes with money.

475
00:31:15,394 --> 00:31:17,306
Scott: you start off with enough money to buy the clothes you want.

476
00:31:17,327 --> 00:31:23,389
Scott: but if you want to change clothes you need more money which means you basically just needed to play me Tomo a bunch and you just keep getting money all the fucking time.

477
00:31:23,429 --> 00:31:25,602
Rym: yeah we talk about candy boxes game rewards you like.

478
00:31:26,024 --> 00:31:29,140
Rym: if you listen to someone's answer it's like here's five me moneys.

479
00:31:29,341 --> 00:31:31,052
Scott: yep you just get moneys all the time.

480
00:31:31,092 --> 00:31:32,863
Rym: it's like oh you got 300 me moneys because whatever.

481
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:34,553
Rym: oh here's another 500 because fuck you.

482
00:31:34,774 --> 00:31:37,088
Scott: yeah just get tons of tons of moneys all the time.

483
00:31:37,108 --> 00:31:38,417
Scott: I don't think you have to pay real.

484
00:31:38,598 --> 00:31:40,588
Scott: I think you can pay real money you can.

485
00:31:40,709 --> 00:31:49,819
Rym: so I actually was you know I was fucking around on a couple days ago and I was like Oh butterfly wings I could buy that and I just click buy and it was like oh you don't have enough money for that is it?

486
00:31:50,162 --> 00:31:52,197
Scott: there hasn't been a single thing I don't have enough money for you.

487
00:31:52,238 --> 00:31:56,340
Rym: and then it was and I was like oh well then it was like you could put your credit card in.

488
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:59,215
Rym: and I was like nope nope nope you're never.

489
00:31:59,235 --> 00:32:02,009
Rym: my credit card will ever go anywhere near you anyway.

490
00:32:02,311 --> 00:32:04,682
Scott: so yeah the only real thing to use money on I guess is clothing.

491
00:32:04,723 --> 00:32:10,507
Scott: but anyway so you dress your me up or not as in Rym's case and then you go into your room.

492
00:32:10,527 --> 00:32:12,656
Rym: I dress up just only from the ways down.

493
00:32:12,716 --> 00:32:24,222
Scott: sure you go in your room and basically you either a just sort of hear what people are talking about or people come visit you or basically it's all about questions and answers.

494
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:26,174
Scott: you can't just say whatever you want like on Twitter.

495
00:32:26,476 --> 00:32:27,783
Scott: there's a question and you answer.

496
00:32:27,824 --> 00:32:32,548
Scott: you can write whatever answer you want but you're supposed to answer the question or otherwise.

497
00:32:32,689 --> 00:32:33,473
Scott: what's the point now?

498
00:32:33,513 --> 00:32:33,714
Rym: what's?

499
00:32:33,975 --> 00:32:39,002
Scott: and you see other people's answers and then you can comment on their answers or heart their answers.

500
00:32:39,063 --> 00:32:40,267
Rym: now only friends.

501
00:32:40,347 --> 00:32:43,498
Rym: this is 100% friends only right.

502
00:32:43,538 --> 00:32:47,660
Scott: see this is what makes it different from other things is that it's super friends only like.

503
00:32:47,861 --> 00:32:56,970
Scott: basically you use Twitter and Facebook to connect and find your friends and then you choose who you're gonna friend and you choose who you're not gonna friend and I'm only choosing people that like.

504
00:32:57,211 --> 00:32:58,618
Scott: I know like I've met them.

505
00:32:58,659 --> 00:33:02,535
Scott: there are people there in my like want to be friends list and it's like.

506
00:33:03,258 --> 00:33:05,428
Scott: I've seen their names on the internet.

507
00:33:05,749 --> 00:33:09,183
Scott: I know that they're like a listener or something you know but I don't like.

508
00:33:09,424 --> 00:33:13,278
Rym: no then I'm gonna be even more judicious like now.

509
00:33:13,459 --> 00:33:18,107
Rym: I pretty much don't accept friend requests unless it's someone I know in person right and then so I don't friend them.

510
00:33:18,147 --> 00:33:23,700
Scott: and then because me Tomo is asking you some serious questions some of the questions are so serious I don't even answer them.

511
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,706
Scott: I'm like I'm not answering.

512
00:33:24,726 --> 00:33:26,598
Rym: I joked about that like when it first came out.

513
00:33:26,618 --> 00:33:31,256
Rym: I tweeted and I was something like me Tomo 2016 what's your favorite food?

514
00:33:31,638 --> 00:33:39,976
Rym: me Tomo 2020. what is your darkest shame that you don't want anyone else in the world to ever know and it's basically asking stuff like that.

515
00:33:40,016 --> 00:33:41,643
Scott: yeah it's like oh what do you regret?

516
00:33:42,065 --> 00:33:44,637
Scott: yeah what are three things you look for in a part?

517
00:33:44,738 --> 00:33:46,805
Rym: where did you hide the body right?

518
00:33:46,885 --> 00:33:47,186
Scott: it's like.

519
00:33:47,848 --> 00:33:50,798
Scott: it's really what it is is just not.

520
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:56,593
Scott: it's not so much a Twitter like what are you doing even though one of the questions is what are you doing lately or what you do last weekend?

521
00:33:56,673 --> 00:34:02,555
Scott: oh it's more like a really highly detailed profile that you share one piece at a time

522
00:34:02,937 --> 00:34:15,690
Rym: which from a design perspective is very interesting because I got to admit if all those questions existed in a social network I would never ever in my life click on anyone I knew to actually read all that crap.

523
00:34:16,011 --> 00:34:20,210
Rym: but here it sort of feeds it to you in the serotonin boosting trickle feed.

524
00:34:20,592 --> 00:34:23,587
Rym: so you're like oh I'm sitting here and I'm bored for three seconds.

525
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:26,763
Rym: oh hey I guess Scott really is into Oreos lately or whatever.

526
00:34:26,984 --> 00:34:28,370
Scott: all right cool it helps you.

527
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:35,605
Scott: it actually is nice because it helps you learn about your friends and things you didn't know about them or confirm things you already knew about.

528
00:34:35,625 --> 00:34:38,924
Scott: because I at least I hope you knew about them because you're their friends.

529
00:34:38,944 --> 00:34:43,083
Scott: if it's all new information to you probably unfriend that person.

530
00:34:44,047 --> 00:34:45,594
Scott: it's not someone you're very close with.

531
00:34:45,735 --> 00:34:51,485
Rym: but the design is brilliant because a lot of times platforms like this will overwhelm you with like a million notifications or whatever.

532
00:34:51,808 --> 00:34:59,714
Rym: so when you log back in one day it's like the people who get afraid of their email inbox like they see a thousand unread emails and they kind of just stop checking their email.

533
00:35:00,358 --> 00:35:01,926
Rym: that like that happens more often than you think.

534
00:35:02,368 --> 00:35:05,788
Rym: this game goes out of its way to be like oh you don't want to answer a question right now.

535
00:35:05,868 --> 00:35:06,251
Rym: it's cool.

536
00:35:06,352 --> 00:35:07,821
Rym: it's cool bro I got you.

537
00:35:08,143 --> 00:35:09,310
Rym: we'll deal with it later.

538
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:13,839
Scott: just and it's like there is technically a feed you can go to the bottom of but you're never gonna get to the bottom of now.

539
00:35:13,859 --> 00:35:17,559
Scott: so you just sort of like poke and listen to a few answers and then stop poking.

540
00:35:17,619 --> 00:35:21,542
Scott: but the serotonin you sat there and kept poking until there were no more answers to here.

541
00:35:21,582 --> 00:35:22,929
Scott: you would be there literally all day.

542
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:25,764
Scott: I did that when I've only got like 10-15 friends.

543
00:35:25,844 --> 00:35:27,873
Rym: I did that when I had three friends.

544
00:35:28,174 --> 00:35:34,445
Scott: I did that day the first two times I opened the app and then I was never able to do it again in a reasonable amount of time.

545
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:36,616
Scott: so I never did yep but I did it now.

546
00:35:36,636 --> 00:35:37,741
Scott: it'd probably take hours.

547
00:35:37,862 --> 00:35:42,857
Rym: the design behind this is frighteningly well thought out.

548
00:35:42,958 --> 00:35:45,107
Rym: so you're answering questions right and it just.

549
00:35:45,208 --> 00:35:48,223
Rym: it always helps you two options more or stop.

550
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:49,651
Rym: so it's like I want to hear more.

551
00:35:49,671 --> 00:35:55,582
Rym: I don't hear on it and as soon as you get bored you hit stop like I'm done with this shit like I gotta go live my real life.

552
00:35:55,602 --> 00:36:00,946
Rym: then it asks you a question yeah as soon as you say you're bored it reinjects novelty.

553
00:36:01,026 --> 00:36:02,939
Scott: it's like oh you don't want to listen to answers anymore.

554
00:36:02,979 --> 00:36:14,659
Rym: make an answer of your own yeah and then you'll stop and then but as soon as you do that then it pops you back out into more novelty and it is really designed to keep you using it for as long as it can.

555
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:20,357
Rym: it's it borders on kampu gacha style psychology evil.

556
00:36:20,397 --> 00:36:24,052
Scott: there's no complete collecting butts though right yeah so anyway.

557
00:36:24,092 --> 00:36:25,719
Scott: so it also has the clothing.

558
00:36:25,759 --> 00:36:30,886
Scott: so the clothing you can just buy with coins that you earn by listening and listening to answers.

559
00:36:31,367 --> 00:36:36,026
Scott: but also you can get clothing with this game called me drop which is like a dumb.

560
00:36:36,146 --> 00:36:39,180
Scott: it's basically like dropping me and it bounces around.

561
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:39,944
Rym: it's Plinko.

562
00:36:40,024 --> 00:36:41,773
Rym: it's bad Plinko it's just Plinko.

563
00:36:41,834 --> 00:36:42,256
Scott: there's different.

564
00:36:42,276 --> 00:36:46,262
Rym: Plinko says I don't do it I'm hoarding tickets cuz eventually there'll be some other game I can play.

565
00:36:46,703 --> 00:36:52,767
Scott: eventually there'll be a clothing worth Plinko ing for yep but yeah all the clothes I need me too.

566
00:36:54,274 --> 00:36:57,506
Scott: so yeah right now there's not really a clothing worth.

567
00:36:57,567 --> 00:37:04,230
Rym: so I'm actually using it right now and someone just gave an answer to a question that is real personal.

568
00:37:04,572 --> 00:37:11,727
Scott: okay like people are given law I wish it had the character limit cuz people give like these essay answers and ignore that nonsense.

569
00:37:11,787 --> 00:37:14,822
Scott: sometimes it's funny though it's just like oh my god shut up.

570
00:37:14,862 --> 00:37:16,711
Scott: I don't care.

571
00:37:16,771 --> 00:37:17,916
Scott: give the same answer shorter.

572
00:37:17,936 --> 00:37:19,906
Scott: I would have cared but I don't because you wrote an essay.

573
00:37:20,428 --> 00:37:20,931
Scott: deal with it.

574
00:37:21,313 --> 00:37:23,345
Scott: so the other thing has is me photo right.

575
00:37:23,365 --> 00:37:34,066
Scott: so that's another thing you might want the clothes for even if you don't want them permanently on your me is to take good me photos and me photo basically lets you pick any background you want even like photos from your phone or images you do.

576
00:37:34,146 --> 00:37:35,715
Scott: any image you can get onto your phone.

577
00:37:35,775 --> 00:37:46,585
Scott: yeah you can use it background and then you can position up to so many me's in the picture in a lot of different poses and write on it and do all and you can create some pretty creative images using this.

578
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:53,313
Scott: my favorite thing is to take a movie poster and then replace the people on the movie poster with me's.

579
00:37:53,434 --> 00:37:54,541
Rym: yeah you sent me a really good one.

580
00:37:54,581 --> 00:37:55,245
Rym: you made today.

581
00:37:55,366 --> 00:37:55,708
Scott: I made.

582
00:37:55,728 --> 00:37:56,733
Scott: I made three good ones.

583
00:37:56,753 --> 00:37:59,288
Scott: I'm holding one back though but what does there?

584
00:37:59,368 --> 00:38:01,360
Scott: one on Twitter I sent one to Rym and a holding one back.

585
00:38:01,481 --> 00:38:04,902
Rym: what's real interesting about that is it lets you use anything and you can type anything.

586
00:38:04,942 --> 00:38:07,272
Rym: like if you type fuck a whole bunch.

587
00:38:07,734 --> 00:38:11,349
Scott: it doesn't care at all cuz if you're only doing it to friends exactly.

588
00:38:11,369 --> 00:38:25,054
Rym: Nintendo has finally found a way around its ridiculous fear of people saying inappropriate things unless you're unless you do something that offends your specific friend and your friends can just unfriend you yeah or they can report you or whatever.

589
00:38:25,074 --> 00:38:33,455
Rym: as long as you don't offend your own friends you can do whatever you want which is extra fun because those photos you can put whatever.

590
00:38:33,495 --> 00:38:44,227
Rym: your guy could be hanging out and go to see if that's what your friend group likes and - it has a voice thing where it'll read in all the me's voices and you can customize the voice and it's actually really good.

591
00:38:44,307 --> 00:38:55,281
Rym: the voices remind me of Tokimeki right for the old yeah except way better because I remember in Tokimeki you got to name your character and we were real excited about it and I believe we eventually made the name.

592
00:38:55,301 --> 00:39:12,693
Rym: but I spent forever tweaking the voice until I got it as close as I possibly could and I feel like almost everyone else did that too except our friend cat who made hers this creaky old lady scary voice.

593
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:15,950
Rym: Chris Rob's actually doing something fun with this thing.

594
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:23,461
Rym: so if you friend him he made this scary-looking alien monster me and it says that's who that is that's Chris Rob.

595
00:39:23,522 --> 00:39:26,850
Rym: chainsaw suit hollow I didn't.

596
00:39:28,334 --> 00:39:29,177
Rym: it's just a visitor.

597
00:39:29,217 --> 00:39:29,919
Rym: so it comes.

598
00:39:29,939 --> 00:39:31,888
Rym: you have my favorite answer he gave ever.

599
00:39:31,988 --> 00:39:40,573
Rym: it's like for one like he made it with this like scary open mouth and all this nonsense and the voice is like really disturbing but he basically tried to make it a creepypasta.

600
00:39:40,634 --> 00:39:50,187
Rym: so sometimes like it just shows up in your house and it's a little unnerving because it's just like stalking around behind your me but one like one of the questions a while that one of the early questions was.

601
00:39:50,649 --> 00:39:57,420
Rym: so what's the thing that you've been noticing a lot lately and are really into and his answer is your breathing.

602
00:39:59,161 --> 00:39:59,865
Rym: it's fun stuff.

603
00:39:59,885 --> 00:40:00,367
Rym: that's been.

604
00:40:00,649 --> 00:40:04,325
Rym: I've noticed more and more people making clever accounts like that.

605
00:40:04,345 --> 00:40:06,433
Rym: that is it is interesting to be friends with.

606
00:40:06,815 --> 00:40:12,128
Rym: hmm and I'm actually in general impressed with the creativity people are putting into the only of one account.

607
00:40:12,189 --> 00:40:14,483
Scott: it's like if I can make a second account I would totally do that.

608
00:40:14,764 --> 00:40:26,692
Rym: yeah the other thing it's doing that I think is great is that you pick a gender for your guy or your me but none of the functionality in the game appears to be tied to that in any way.

609
00:40:26,832 --> 00:40:31,823
Scott: it only chooses the shape of the body of your me and that's pretty much it and it doesn't even change the shape that much.

610
00:40:31,884 --> 00:40:35,683
Scott: the only real difference is like and you can choose like all the aspects of your me.

611
00:40:35,784 --> 00:40:36,125
Scott: it's like.

612
00:40:36,487 --> 00:40:42,676
Scott: you can use the you know supposedly girl hair or supposedly guy hair on no matter what you know whatever you can.

613
00:40:42,777 --> 00:40:44,526
Scott: any clothing clothing is the same way.

614
00:40:44,646 --> 00:40:46,515
Scott: all options are available to all people.

615
00:40:46,616 --> 00:40:48,667
Rym: I can buy skirts and whatever I bought.

616
00:40:48,687 --> 00:40:51,163
Rym: a kimono was the only one in the game and happens to be a woman's kimono.

617
00:40:51,183 --> 00:40:52,531
Rym: but whatever that's what I got.

618
00:40:52,551 --> 00:40:53,215
Rym: that's what I use.

619
00:40:53,236 --> 00:40:54,884
Scott: yeah I can wear a dress if I want.

620
00:40:54,924 --> 00:40:58,879
Rym: the only difference is if you're a female in the game.

621
00:40:58,919 --> 00:41:02,043
Rym: if you pick that as your gender it looks like you just swap back and forth whenever you want to.

622
00:41:02,746 --> 00:41:03,550
Rym: it doesn't even like.

623
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:12,481
Rym: it seems to avoid pronouns which is nice but it puts a little like sort of sweatshirt II bra over your bits at the top.

624
00:41:13,124 --> 00:41:14,873
Scott: oh you can't take your shirt.

625
00:41:14,913 --> 00:41:16,240
Rym: oh yeah you can't be shirtless if you're female.

626
00:41:16,622 --> 00:41:21,482
Rym: hmm but you could just be male choose all female characteristics and be as shirtless as you want.

627
00:41:21,903 --> 00:41:28,778
Scott: oh baby yeah flat nipple is chest yeah but I'm.

628
00:41:29,179 --> 00:41:30,303
Rym: I feel like that is fine.

629
00:41:30,323 --> 00:41:37,031
Rym: like Nintendo gets it after the uproar over some poor choices they made in previous things like this they've done.

630
00:41:37,393 --> 00:41:39,884
Scott: yes I think me Tomo is it's a candy box.

631
00:41:39,925 --> 00:41:43,585
Scott: so if you need another candy box you can get this one and stop playing Neko Atsume or whatever.

632
00:41:43,706 --> 00:41:54,856
Scott: yeah and then too if you've got some friends and you like you know you know you use Twitter and things like talk about specific things or you know post links to stuff you know it's like.

633
00:41:55,237 --> 00:42:07,009
Scott: if you if you have a goal of actually wanting to like learn things about your friends or perhaps even go closer with them through a digital means this is I mean it's still just sort of like an app.

634
00:42:07,069 --> 00:42:09,040
Scott: it's not like it's gonna help you grow closer.

635
00:42:11,142 --> 00:42:21,277
Rym: actually the kinds of questions that unless you're still in college and it's four in the morning and you're all sitting in a lounge somewhere you're not gonna ask people these questions in your day-to-day adult life.

636
00:42:21,377 --> 00:42:31,026
Scott: no but you know you can learn more about your friends and they can learn about you and it'll actually it actually works to some extent greater than zero which is pretty amazing for an app.

637
00:42:31,327 --> 00:42:35,814
Scott: no app has achieved that before I check it one and especially not something you would expect from the intent.

638
00:42:35,834 --> 00:42:38,705
Scott: I check it on the sorry Narosh Max.

639
00:42:39,026 --> 00:42:43,544
Rym: yeah well pretty much now it's gonna be this and Pokemon go will be my only candy boxes.

640
00:42:44,206 --> 00:42:45,992
Rym: this is 100% replaced.

641
00:42:46,513 --> 00:42:50,106
Rym: all that 3ds but nonsense I'm just never gonna touch that stuff again.

642
00:42:50,126 --> 00:42:53,140
Rym: I will never ever share a puzzle piece.

643
00:42:53,422 --> 00:42:54,830
Rym: I will never ever ever do anything.

644
00:42:54,931 --> 00:42:55,454
Scott: I'm just gonna.

645
00:42:55,515 --> 00:43:02,009
Scott: I'm gonna keep making sure I have all the puzzle pieces and the gate and then on the 3ds is nice because I can try to get people from all the countries.

646
00:43:02,452 --> 00:43:05,169
Rym: I've got a lot of countries like way more than you and I just don't care.

647
00:43:05,189 --> 00:43:06,557
Rym: I just I'm not gonna do it.

648
00:43:06,698 --> 00:43:06,838
Rym: I've.

649
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,031
Scott: I wonder if anything happens you get all the countries on earth.

650
00:43:10,057 --> 00:43:10,560
Rym: uh you know what.

651
00:43:11,203 --> 00:43:13,533
Rym: if something does there'll be a YouTube video of it.

652
00:43:13,975 --> 00:43:20,483
Scott: I wonder if I got a second 3ds like about a new 3ds and I kept like changing the country on it and kept street passing it.

653
00:43:21,246 --> 00:43:24,578
Rym: would I eventually is all that someone's already done that?

654
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,786
Scott: if it's possible maybe I'll check YouTube.

655
00:43:26,967 --> 00:43:31,364
Rym: yeah but uh we'll see where this goes because it's I mean it.

656
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:35,258
Rym: it's a game by any reasonable definition of a game.

657
00:43:35,278 --> 00:43:36,041
Rym: it's just.

658
00:43:36,061 --> 00:43:38,711
Rym: it's not an ortho game it's not.

659
00:43:39,273 --> 00:43:42,264
Rym: it's just basically a social network with a few game elements.

660
00:43:42,345 --> 00:43:44,975
Scott: it's as much of a game as cookie cutter.

661
00:43:44,995 --> 00:43:49,301
Scott: yeah right only this one helps you learn about your friends instead of just hurting your hand.

662
00:43:49,482 --> 00:43:50,868
Rym: but it will be interesting to see.

663
00:43:50,888 --> 00:44:03,902
Rym: I suspect Nintendo is going to use this as a like core linchpin in expanding into mobile and into getting everyone to have a Nintendo account to link all the Nintendo things they do together into one thing.

664
00:44:03,963 --> 00:44:04,707
Rym: I think it's most.

665
00:44:04,848 --> 00:44:06,015
Scott: I think it transcends consoles.

666
00:44:06,156 --> 00:44:07,041
Scott: that's the main goal.

667
00:44:07,082 --> 00:44:10,276
Scott: is they finally made Nintendo accounts properly that you know?

668
00:44:10,657 --> 00:44:13,934
Scott: like the same way Xbox Live has accounts and Sony has accounts.

669
00:44:14,155 --> 00:44:34,454
Scott: they should have done that earlier but basically to get people to adopt these new accounts that also go with the new you know Nintendo Club replacement thing they made me Tomo to encourage you to get the Nintendo account because if you don't get the account then you can't really friend people unless you meet them in person and you can't save your me Tomo stuff to the internet.

670
00:44:34,736 --> 00:44:36,766
Scott: yeah don't lose your phone if you lose your phone.

671
00:44:36,786 --> 00:44:39,321
Scott: so you basically really need the account to hook up your stuff.

672
00:44:39,642 --> 00:44:52,823
Rym: so now in the future when they want to eventually stop selling consoles entirely and just have like some simple device that goes the cloud stream whatever and then all the games are on phones which I think is the far future of Nintendo.

673
00:44:53,606 --> 00:44:54,851
Rym: they're setting up for that.

674
00:44:54,891 --> 00:44:58,145
Rym: they're setting up to be not tied to Nintendo hardware.

675
00:44:58,165 --> 00:45:00,698
Rym: I don't know if they'll jump ship on hardware.

676
00:45:00,718 --> 00:45:02,066
Scott: I don't know you're setting up for that.

677
00:45:02,086 --> 00:45:04,824
Scott: they're just setting up for get people to get Nintendo account.

678
00:45:04,864 --> 00:45:09,866
Rym: I think they're setting up to be able to jump ship from hardware down the road if they need to.

679
00:45:10,067 --> 00:45:15,112
Scott: no I don't think Nintendo has never wanted a different hardware and I don't think they will.

680
00:45:15,172 --> 00:45:17,022
Rym: yeah but this and now Pokemon go.

681
00:45:17,123 --> 00:45:19,875
Scott: just stay tuned come on go is a third party thing.

682
00:45:19,915 --> 00:45:23,429
Scott: yeah but Nintendo's letting it happen and Pokemon companies letting it.

683
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:26,662
Rym: yeah Pokemon is one of the main reasons.

684
00:45:26,702 --> 00:45:29,276
Rym: a lot of people we know even still pay attention to Nintendo.

685
00:45:29,598 --> 00:45:35,619
Scott: Pokemon the Pokemon company is not entirely a hundred percent part of Nintendo.

686
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:37,088
Rym: yeah what if they go entirely?

687
00:45:37,108 --> 00:45:38,436
Scott: it's just basically attached at the hip.

688
00:45:38,738 --> 00:45:42,051
Rym: yeah what if they and suddenly decided to go entirely phone online?

689
00:45:42,071 --> 00:45:46,650
Scott: I don't know who what kind of contracts exist exactly?

690
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:46,951
Rym: it's all.

691
00:45:47,232 --> 00:45:48,216
Rym: we'll see what happens.

692
00:45:48,778 --> 00:45:53,964
Scott: but I know that is possible to be an employee of the Pokemon company without being an employee of Nintendo.

693
00:45:53,984 --> 00:46:02,202
Rym: I'll put it this way Nintendo with me Tomo and the Nintendo account is setting up a scaffolding that they could use in a number of ways.

694
00:46:09,234 --> 00:46:11,498
Rym: this has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

695
