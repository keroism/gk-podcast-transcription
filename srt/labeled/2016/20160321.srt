1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:09,080
Scott:

2
00:00:09,082 --> 00:00:12,873
Rym: It's Monday, March 21st, 2016.

3
00:00:12,873 --> 00:00:13,334
Rym: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:13,394 --> 00:00:13,916
Scott: I'm Scott.

5
00:00:14,016 --> 00:00:15,480
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight.

6
00:00:15,821 --> 00:00:17,999
Rym: We're talking about technology news.

7
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:23,018
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:31,950
Scott: So first of all, we haven't done a tech news roundup since April last year, so it's okay if we win again.

9
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:42,630
Rym: We basically spent an hour arguing about what to do the show on because Scott does not like most tech ideas, nor does he want to talk about tech news except in the context of a tech news roundup.

10
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:43,532
Scott: Yeah, that's fine.

11
00:00:43,673 --> 00:00:47,290
Scott: Anyway, it's been a year since we did it, so we can do it again once, and we'll think of something for next Monday.

12
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:49,239
Scott: But anyway, check this out.

13
00:00:49,721 --> 00:00:51,590
Scott: So, let's say you go to poop.

14
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,903
Scott: You go to poop, and you look- What, like Fountains of Blood?

15
00:00:56,943 --> 00:00:57,789
Rym: Like, where's this going?

16
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:01,290
Scott: Well, I was just about to say, what would be the most disconcerting thing to come out of your butt?

17
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:01,710
Scott: Fountains of Blood.

18
00:01:01,951 --> 00:01:07,930
Scott: Right, so Fountains of Blood did not come out because obviously I would be in some sort of hospital and not recording a podcast.

19
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:27,030
Rym: So, from what I've gathered, this is kind of a total aside, a scary percentage of American adult men when, not necessarily fountains, but when significant amounts of blood come out of there, oftentimes they do not go to the doctor out of shame and just kind of let it be and hope it goes away on its

20
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:27,150
Scott: own.

21
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:31,770
Scott: The most serious thing, besides blood coming out of your mouth, is blood coming out of the other end.

22
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,930
Rym: Well, the thing is, it's one of those things where most of the time, yeah, you got a hemorrhoid.

23
00:01:35,871 --> 00:01:37,810
Scott: If you got a hemorrhoid, you should still go to a doctor.

24
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,430
Rym: There's nothing you can do about them, except wait.

25
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:40,829
Scott: There's plenty you can do.

26
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:42,930
Scott: Yeah, sit less, that's a good start.

27
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:44,910
Scott: Anyway- Sit on a donut, that's a good start.

28
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:47,670
Rym: All right, I'm curious where this is going, because obviously something came out of your butt.

29
00:01:47,812 --> 00:01:49,410
Rym: Right, so- And it wasn't a fountain of blood.

30
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:55,568
Scott: No, so some poop came out, and the poop, disconcertingly, was green.

31
00:01:56,572 --> 00:01:56,854
Scott: Green?

32
00:01:56,934 --> 00:01:59,570
Rym: All right, that implies gallstone issues?

33
00:02:00,011 --> 00:02:00,830
Rym: Or gallbladder issues?

34
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,890
Scott: All right, so first of all, I was very surprised.

35
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:07,230
Scott: Number one, usually you expect this to happen when you ate a bunch of green food, right?

36
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,049
Scott: That's totally normal.

37
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:12,690
Rym: Nah, usually I expect it to happen when you eat way too much oily, greasy food.

38
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:20,270
Scott: Well, I mean, there have been times where I've eaten a whole ton of lettuce all at once, and then when I poop- I don't think that makes your poop green unless you didn't chew.

39
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,769
Scott: Like shreds of lettuce come out?

40
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,121
Rym: Yeah, that shreds, Scott.

41
00:02:23,141 --> 00:02:24,090
Rym: That means you didn't chew.

42
00:02:25,372 --> 00:02:27,482
Scott: I don't chew very much, that is for sure.

43
00:02:27,783 --> 00:02:29,330
Scott: I definitely eat too fast and don't chew enough.

44
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:36,550
Scott: But anyway, so some poop came out that was tinted green, and then when I wiped my butt, like on the toilet paper, it looked like a grass stain.

45
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,879
Scott: And I was like, whoa, that's weird.

46
00:02:39,712 --> 00:02:44,070
Scott: All right, so- And what made it even weirder was that I had not eaten anything green recently.

47
00:02:45,211 --> 00:02:47,339
Scott: So then I'm like, well, okay, just one poop.

48
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,905
Scott: We'll see what happens in the next poops.

49
00:02:48,966 --> 00:02:50,070
Scott: The next poop comes around.

50
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:53,390
Rym: So everything I'm reading is backing up what I was saying about green stool so far.

51
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:57,350
Scott: So anyway, I poop again and it's green again, and I'm like, whoa, now we have an issue.

52
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,549
Scott: So I search the internet now.

53
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:04,148
Scott: See, 'cause you- And I was very surprised the internet did not say, "Cancer, you're gonna

54
00:03:04,188 --> 00:03:04,409
Scott: die.".

55
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:07,710
Scott: I was like shocked that it didn't say- like it wasn't really a big deal.

56
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:10,150
Scott: They're like, oh yeah, meat is actually bile that's green.

57
00:03:10,672 --> 00:03:13,010
Scott: It's supposed to get reabsorbed in your large intestine.

58
00:03:13,612 --> 00:03:15,610
Scott: And if there's a problem, it won't get reabsorbed.

59
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:17,679
Scott: And that's kind of an issue.

60
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:19,689
Scott: Go see a doctor about it if it keeps happening.

61
00:03:20,311 --> 00:03:22,530
Scott: It could be bad, but it's not the end of the world really.

62
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,380
Scott: It's not AIDS, you're not dying.

63
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,530
Scott: It's kind of, you know, it happens.

64
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:31,570
Rym: In fact, from what I gather, the more dangerous one is if you have pale poop regularly.

65
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:32,823
Scott: Yeah, that's super dangerous.

66
00:03:33,167 --> 00:03:36,250
Rym: So anyway- Well, it's more that there's a pigment that's missing because of stuff.

67
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:42,670
Rym: Oh, wow, I just realized I typed "green stool" into Google right now, and it showed me, people also asked.

68
00:03:42,831 --> 00:03:43,946
Scott: I typed, "Why is my poop

69
00:03:43,966 --> 00:03:44,209
Scott: green?".

70
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,579
Rym: What does it mean if my poop is green?

71
00:03:45,841 --> 00:03:47,130
Rym: What does it mean if my poop is black?

72
00:03:47,511 --> 00:03:48,798
Rym: Why is your poop brown?

73
00:03:49,221 --> 00:03:50,930
Rym: What does it mean if your poop is red?

74
00:03:51,371 --> 00:03:53,216
Scott: Right, so anyway, yeah, red is bad.

75
00:03:54,038 --> 00:03:56,645
Scott: So anyway, I pooped again today.

76
00:03:56,665 --> 00:03:58,310
Scott: It was not green at all.

77
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:03,388
Scott: But in between the second green poop and today, right, today was just sort of like, "Whew, I was

78
00:04:03,448 --> 00:04:03,649
Scott: right.".

79
00:04:04,112 --> 00:04:05,349
Scott: I figured out what the issue was.

80
00:04:05,611 --> 00:04:06,670
Rym: All right, I'm real curious.

81
00:04:07,712 --> 00:04:10,708
Scott: I ordered a food from Grubhub the other week.

82
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:14,130
Rym: And one of the ingredients was just like a bucket of green food coloring?

83
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:18,350
Scott: No, so actually there's this place called Burger Club near me, but I don't order a burger from them.

84
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:23,130
Scott: I order this chicken sandwich they make, which is a kind of a long-ish sandwich, but not super long.

85
00:04:24,171 --> 00:04:28,710
Scott: And they put the grilled chicken, but they grill it so nice so that it still tastes good and it's not dry.

86
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:33,670
Scott: And then they put on, it's almost like steak on French bread we used to get, only with quality ingredients.

87
00:04:34,111 --> 00:04:37,550
Scott: They put on the cheeses, but it's like real cheese, not bullshit cheese.

88
00:04:38,072 --> 00:04:40,950
Scott: And they put on, you know, the peppers, the onions, the mushrooms, and the bacon.

89
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:42,585
Scott: And then this special sauce.

90
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:42,990
Scott: It's good.

91
00:04:43,552 --> 00:04:44,457
Scott: And it comes with fries.

92
00:04:44,477 --> 00:04:46,650
Scott: You can get waffles, sweet potato, or regular fries.

93
00:04:47,052 --> 00:04:48,480
Scott: But they're hand cut and they make them there.

94
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,667
Scott: It's not like frozen fries.

95
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:50,230
Scott: It's good shit.

96
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:51,442
Rym: All right, so they make, so...

97
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,883
Scott: If you buy this chicken sandwich, it does not meet the $15 delivery limit.

98
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,408
Scott: So you need to buy something else.

99
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,270
Scott: I'm only one person, so there's not much I can buy.

100
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,750
Scott: I can either get dessert or a beverage to put it over the limit.

101
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:08,624
Scott: And a regular beverage, like a lemonade, doesn't put you over.

102
00:05:08,945 --> 00:05:09,890
Scott: You gotta go milkshake.

103
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,909
Rym: I will usually, in that case, I was about to say get the milkshake.

104
00:05:13,832 --> 00:05:15,810
Rym: Or get the dessert you can eat the next day.

105
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,730
Scott: It's weird to get the milkshake in the winter.

106
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:20,910
Scott: Yeah, because when you eat that chicken sandwich and the fries, you don't have room for the cake, okay?

107
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:21,284
Scott: Yeah.

108
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:24,010
Scott: Unless you're some sort of, you know, really large person, which I'm not.

109
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:27,610
Rym: Right, and not that long ago, we went to, we tried to go downstairs to get a burger and they were full.

110
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,390
Rym: So we went to another place and got food.

111
00:05:29,732 --> 00:05:31,468
Rym: And on the way back, we're like, "Oh, the burger place is

112
00:05:31,529 --> 00:05:31,650
Rym: open.".

113
00:05:31,752 --> 00:05:32,510
Rym: And then I had a burger.

114
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:33,840
Scott: What the fuck?

115
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:34,345
Scott: Anyway...

116
00:05:34,831 --> 00:05:36,730
Rym: I am a master, I'm a master, man.

117
00:05:36,811 --> 00:05:37,900
Scott: Maybe we're able to get the dessert.

118
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:38,949
Scott: I can only get the milkshake.

119
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,382
Scott: Because it's actually a small milkshake.

120
00:05:40,422 --> 00:05:41,130
Scott: It's not full size.

121
00:05:41,253 --> 00:05:41,526
Scott: All right.

122
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,494
Scott: But it's four bucks.

123
00:05:42,554 --> 00:05:44,364
Scott: It puts you over the top of the delivery limit.

124
00:05:44,424 --> 00:05:44,545
Scott: So...

125
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,479
Rym: Green milkshake because of St.

126
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,810
Rym: Patrick's Day and then forget it.

127
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:47,931
Scott: No.

128
00:05:48,054 --> 00:05:48,747
Scott: No, I did not.

129
00:05:49,252 --> 00:05:50,602
Scott: I did not get green milkshake.

130
00:05:50,622 --> 00:05:51,206
Scott: I don't fuck St.

131
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:51,770
Scott: Patrick's Day.

132
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:52,789
Scott: It's the worst holiday ever.

133
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,769
Rym: It's only the worst holiday because we live in New York.

134
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:55,439
Scott: Fuck St.

135
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:55,770
Scott: Patrick.

136
00:05:57,176 --> 00:05:57,984
Scott: Let the snakes stay.

137
00:05:58,308 --> 00:05:58,510
Scott: Anyway.

138
00:05:59,931 --> 00:06:03,429
Scott: So they do have a wide variety of interesting milkshakes to choose from.

139
00:06:05,767 --> 00:06:06,609
Rym: And... Did you choose bile?

140
00:06:07,011 --> 00:06:07,191
Scott: No.

141
00:06:07,653 --> 00:06:11,928
Scott: I usually choose something like strawberry banana, which actually has real strawberries and bananas in it.

142
00:06:12,752 --> 00:06:16,150
Scott: Or this Oreo one, which has crushed up Oreo in it.

143
00:06:16,653 --> 00:06:18,230
Rym: See, I like very complex food.

144
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,269
Rym: I think I have a moderately complex palate.

145
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,385
Scott: When it comes to milkshakes, I want vanilla.

146
00:06:23,292 --> 00:06:25,249
Rym: I want vanilla with Oreos in it.

147
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:27,490
Rym: Maybe I want salted caramel.

148
00:06:28,035 --> 00:06:28,590
Rym: That's pushing it.

149
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,442
Scott: I mean, I'll get strawberry.

150
00:06:29,462 --> 00:06:29,970
Scott: I'll get vanilla.

151
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:31,770
Rym: Strawberry's often low-rent.

152
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,343
Scott: They have so many varieties of milkshake.

153
00:06:33,383 --> 00:06:34,150
Scott: I like to try them all.

154
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:38,610
Rym: But the thing is, in most places, a strawberry milkshake is fake-ish strawberry flavor.

155
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:39,499
Scott: Not from this place.

156
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,147
Scott: It's real strawberry.

157
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:43,370
Rym: If I see them mushing up strawberries in my vanilla ice cream, yeah.

158
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:46,210
Scott: There are strawberries in there because you can't get them through your straw.

159
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:50,350
Scott: So there might be also strawberry syrup, but there are also real strawberries in the milkshake.

160
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,430
Rym: There's gotta be at least more than one real strawberry.

161
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:54,270
Scott: There will be many real strawberries in it.

162
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,490
Scott: Because the banana one, you get chunks of banana stuck in the straw.

163
00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:00,250
Scott: Anyway, they had a new one on the menu that looked interesting.

164
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:01,196
Scott: So I ordered it.

165
00:07:01,297 --> 00:07:02,689
Scott: It was the Cookie Monster milkshake.

166
00:07:04,637 --> 00:07:05,169
Rym: Was it blue?

167
00:07:06,094 --> 00:07:07,530
Scott: It was the color of Cookie Monster.

168
00:07:08,476 --> 00:07:10,470
Scott: And I did not put that two and two together.

169
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,557
Rym: Your brain was like, "Green is not blue.

170
00:07:13,618 --> 00:07:15,103
Rym: This is irrelevant information.

171
00:07:15,123 --> 00:07:16,529
Rym: I will not send it up the

172
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:16,830
Rym: chain.".

173
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:19,170
Scott: There was so much food coloring in that milkshake.

174
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:21,019
Scott: You know what it was?

175
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,410
Scott: It wasn't even that good.

176
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:27,530
Scott: It was a vanilla milkshake with blue food coloring and crushed-up cookie dough bits.

177
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:28,349
Scott: But not enough of them.

178
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:31,310
Rym: Oh, see, it should have at least been some blueberry flavor.

179
00:07:32,192 --> 00:07:34,809
Scott: If it was blueberry, it would have not been food coloring.

180
00:07:36,133 --> 00:07:38,025
Scott: I've had blue poops after blueberries.

181
00:07:38,045 --> 00:07:38,649
Scott: That's normal.

182
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:43,950
Rym: A Cookie Monster milkshake should just be cookies and cream, but triple the amount of cookie you put in it.

183
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:45,729
Scott: It should just be cookie dough bits.

184
00:07:46,611 --> 00:07:47,649
Scott: Just a whole bunch of them.

185
00:07:47,649 --> 00:07:50,325
Scott: 50% cookie dough bits, 50% ice cream.

186
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:54,090
Rym: No, just put a whole bunch of chocolate chip cookies in a blender and just blend it.

187
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,189
Scott: But yeah, don't order the Cookie Monster milkshake.

188
00:07:57,816 --> 00:07:58,067
Rym: Wow.

189
00:07:59,634 --> 00:08:00,509
Scott: That's all I gotta say.

190
00:08:00,991 --> 00:08:03,049
Rym: So, I guess my opening bit...

191
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:03,828
Scott: I killed plenty of time.

192
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:12,910
Rym: What I was gonna talk about is that I am scoping out the state of building a new PC because my PC is getting a little bit long in the tooth.

193
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:13,665
Scott: What's wrong with it?

194
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:14,989
Rym: It doesn't have USB.

195
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:15,639
Scott: How long tooth?

196
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,309
Scott: Narwhal long?

197
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:18,750
Rym: 2009 is pushing the limit.

198
00:08:20,554 --> 00:08:21,869
Scott: But yeah, didn't you upgrade it once?

199
00:08:22,811 --> 00:08:23,462
Rym: What do you mean?

200
00:08:23,523 --> 00:08:23,930
Rym: upgrade it?

201
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,509
Scott: You replaced the GPU, didn't you?

202
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:28,129
Rym: I've replaced the GPU three times.

203
00:08:28,632 --> 00:08:30,468
Scott: Whoa, so it has a good enough GPU.

204
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:31,012
Scott: The GPU's fine.

205
00:08:31,072 --> 00:08:31,435
Rym: It's a GTX 770.

206
00:08:31,435 --> 00:08:32,481
Rym: That's actually plenty.

207
00:08:34,251 --> 00:08:34,518
Scott: It's got an i7?

208
00:08:35,572 --> 00:08:37,010
Rym: It's got the best i7 in 2009.

209
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:37,577
Scott: Nothing wrong with that.

210
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:38,469
Scott: How much RAM does it have?

211
00:08:39,073 --> 00:08:40,570
Rym: It's got the max I could put in there.

212
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:41,190
Rym: Which is how much?

213
00:08:42,933 --> 00:08:44,006
Scott: You think you need 16 these days?

214
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:48,650
Rym: I would like 32 because 32 does not cost appreciably more than 16.

215
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:51,384
Scott: So at work, my laptop actually is an X220.

216
00:08:51,524 --> 00:08:52,630
Scott: It's old, right?

217
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:55,163
Scott: But it doesn't need a GPU because it's work.

218
00:08:55,344 --> 00:08:56,047
Scott: I don't need a GPU.

219
00:08:56,088 --> 00:08:56,429
Scott: It might work.

220
00:08:57,293 --> 00:08:58,450
Scott: So it's not a problem, right?

221
00:08:58,953 --> 00:09:00,340
Scott: It's got an i7.

222
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,144
Scott: It's fast enough.

223
00:09:01,365 --> 00:09:02,210
Scott: It gets my job done.

224
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:06,950
Rym: My point out, Scott, it's the new, like the modern i7 with the different numbering, right?

225
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:08,180
Rym: Yeah, my i7 is...

226
00:09:09,111 --> 00:09:11,450
Scott: An X220 is actually, I think it's as old as yours.

227
00:09:12,851 --> 00:09:13,826
Scott: Yeah, that's a Lenovo X220.

228
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:15,530
Scott: I was about to say, there's no Intel.

229
00:09:16,394 --> 00:09:18,166
Scott: It has the non-chiclet keyboard.

230
00:09:18,206 --> 00:09:18,670
Scott: It's so old.

231
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,056
Rym: So do you have a core?

232
00:09:20,478 --> 00:09:23,072
Rym: Still, you might not have the core i7, I guess, 920?

233
00:09:23,072 --> 00:09:23,396
Scott: I don't know.

234
00:09:23,497 --> 00:09:24,470
Scott: I don't know what one is in there.

235
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,048
Scott: You might have the weird mobile i7.

236
00:09:26,351 --> 00:09:27,704
Scott: It's definitely a mobile one, for sure.

237
00:09:27,724 --> 00:09:28,249
Scott: Anyway.

238
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:29,529
Rym: Yeah, I got the legit one.

239
00:09:29,992 --> 00:09:32,570
Scott: So, but it's fast enough for my work, no problem.

240
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:35,299
Rym: Yeah, so my i7... And I have two SSDs, two.

241
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,110
Scott: One in the docking station and one in the laptop.

242
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:38,516
Rym: But Scott, I've talked about this on the show before.

243
00:09:38,576 --> 00:09:45,990
Rym: The limitations are, one, I've got old ass SATA that actually is not fast enough to read 4K video live for prepare.

244
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,609
Scott: I'm not video editing it.

245
00:09:47,794 --> 00:09:48,368
Rym: Well, I am.

246
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:52,029
Scott: But also, the problem is, it only has 8 gigs of RAM.

247
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,440
Scott: And I can't get more in there.

248
00:09:53,501 --> 00:09:54,430
Scott: I already filmed it.

249
00:09:55,092 --> 00:09:55,880
Rym: I'm using 8 now!

250
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:06,570
Scott: That's what I'm saying, is at work, I'm running, even though I'm not doing fancy video editing or anything, I got my freaking VirtualBox running, doing my work and stuff, and Chrome and two browsers going.

251
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:13,110
Scott: I use all 8 gigs of the RAM if I open it up, and not because it's inefficient memory usage, because I'm using so much stuff just to get my job done.

252
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:25,330
Scott: What happens is, is when I switch tabs in Chrome, just because it's out of memory, Chrome actually unloads the tabs I'm not looking at recently from RAM, which includes my mail tab, which has Hangouts in it.

253
00:10:25,631 --> 00:10:29,770
Scott: So if I move away from the Hangouts tab, that tab will unload.

254
00:10:30,092 --> 00:10:31,510
Scott: If I go back to it, it'll reload.

255
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:35,670
Scott: So if you message me on Hangouts, it goes to my phone, because Hangouts isn't running.

256
00:10:36,431 --> 00:10:41,917
Scott: So I need to get more RAM, and it's like, I kind of need a new work computer just to get more RAM in there, because I'm at the limit.

257
00:10:41,937 --> 00:10:44,030
Scott: And that sucks, because everything else is still just fine.

258
00:10:46,553 --> 00:10:54,489
Rym: So, I've run into a lot of problems just with the computer being old, in terms of, you know, actually my GPU is underperforming, because that's how old the buses are.

259
00:10:55,151 --> 00:10:59,509
Scott: Oh, so the GPU could go into PCI Express 16, whatever, but you don't have, yeah.

260
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:02,410
Rym: There's a lot, like that's how old this stupid computer is.

261
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:05,390
Scott: But I found, in my experience, that hasn't really mattered that much.

262
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:12,550
Scott: I put an 880 into my older, whatever, I upgraded the GPU to my old computer, and the performance went through the roof, and it didn't even matter.

263
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:17,530
Rym: And I'm telling you, if I were not editing video, like 4K video, literally no reason to upgrade.

264
00:11:17,935 --> 00:11:19,250
Rym: But that is the thing.

265
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,649
Scott: Well, just stop recording in 4K then.

266
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:22,230
Rym: Yeah, you could actually.

267
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,067
Scott: You could do 1080p's.

268
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:25,250
Rym: You could, and that would save me a lot of editing grief.

269
00:11:25,671 --> 00:11:27,650
Rym: So to edit our videos, I actually...

270
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:31,108
Scott: I mean, if it's not something beautiful that needs to be in 4K, but it's our faces, we can do 1080p's.

271
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:37,650
Rym: The problem is that actually the 4K makes it way better for the rendering, and the effects, and I can do the digital zoom.

272
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:39,330
Scott: Well, I can do a digital zoom in the camera.

273
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:48,350
Scott: If you do 1080p, right, so the camera, when you do 4K, the camera that I have, when you do 4K, it's 1 pixel to 1 pixel, obviously, because there's only so many pixels in the sensor, right?

274
00:11:48,771 --> 00:11:51,410
Scott: If you do 1080p, it's actually 4 to 1.

275
00:11:51,410 --> 00:12:01,050
Scott: It's using the same area on the camera that the 4K would be recorded in, but taking 4 pixels on the sensor and merging them into 1 pixel in the resulting MPEG.

276
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:16,030
Scott: You can tell it to just do a 1 to 1, right, and use 1 pixel on the sensor for 1 pixel on the resulting video for 1080p, and you get a 2X digital zoom without, you know, really losing much, right?

277
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:28,170
Rym: So, the problem with that is that by having the full 4K and you zooming out a little bit, I'm always hesitant, because I like to take a really close shot of us, but we will migrate back and forth occasionally.

278
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:33,847
Rym: So, having the wider frame means I have the leeway to, like, have a back out zoom.

279
00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:40,310
Rym: if one of us, and we both do it with equal quantities, you'll just, like, walk way over to the left for no reason.

280
00:12:40,772 --> 00:12:43,769
Rym: I'll, like, just start slowly drifting to the right for no reason.

281
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:55,430
Rym: So, having that extra space helps a lot, but when I edit the videos, I actually have to turn off the preview of the 4K, do all my editing, and then I go back in with the preview on and, like, do all my final framing and everything.

282
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:59,570
Scott: I think something else I'm going to start trying is trusting the battery and the camera more.

283
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:02,649
Scott: I've always positioned the camera based on where the outlets are and just dealing with it.

284
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:07,090
Scott: I think if we have a fully charged camera battery, we can theoretically make it through a panel.

285
00:13:07,272 --> 00:13:08,226
Rym: Well, if you do that...

286
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,270
Scott: And we can put the camera in the optimal position.

287
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,990
Rym: And I'll put my camera in the holes.

288
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:15,090
Rym: I'll put my camera in the holes, the camcorder for the backup.

289
00:13:15,131 --> 00:13:19,888
Scott: As a safety, in case... Right, because I think it says on the camera it's going to last an hour plus, so...

290
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,909
Rym: Yeah, an hour plus, I've seen that number dip.

291
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,858
Scott: No, it actually says, like, how many minutes.

292
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:27,689
Scott: It's, like, an hour, 20 something minutes, or, like, two, you know... No, we'll see.

293
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:30,830
Scott: If I fully charge a battery, we can make it through one panel.

294
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:39,130
Rym: But doing that and actually doing some audio stuff, like, in Audition, like, there's some effects that max my CPU out if I try to render them live.

295
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,010
Scott: I mean, they're going to max out any CPU.

296
00:13:41,631 --> 00:13:44,810
Scott: Getting a better CPU will improve the time, but you're still going to max out.

297
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:51,130
Rym: No, actually, because I... So, pretty much, I'm right below the limit for a lot of these things.

298
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:56,830
Rym: About 3.1 GHz processor is actually the point at which these things will all happen in real time.

299
00:13:57,772 --> 00:14:01,290
Rym: And I'm at 2.67, because that was the best you could buy in 2009.

300
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:02,630
Scott: I think I have three or four, I don't even remember.

301
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:03,758
Rym: Yeah, then you have a way later.

302
00:14:03,758 --> 00:14:06,250
Rym: 2009, 2.67.

303
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,430
Scott: I usually start looking at upgrading computers in five years.

304
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,301
Scott: And mine is less than five years.

305
00:14:11,341 --> 00:14:12,230
Scott: It's, like, three or four years.

306
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:15,450
Rym: And also, so, the funny thing is, my computer was doing way worse.

307
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:19,370
Rym: So, I took the computer and dusted the fuck out of it.

308
00:14:19,851 --> 00:14:23,190
Rym: And I discovered that a lot of the fans weren't working too well, so I replaced all the busted fans.

309
00:14:24,152 --> 00:14:26,529
Rym: And it is working significantly faster now.

310
00:14:27,471 --> 00:14:28,590
Rym: But not fast enough.

311
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,942
Scott: I brought up too many cans of air.

312
00:14:29,962 --> 00:14:30,749
Scott: I'm going to blow mine out.

313
00:14:31,632 --> 00:14:39,810
Rym: But anyway, the current state of the art, if you spend under $2,000, you can build a goddamn supercomputer.

314
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:43,097
Scott: You can build a supercomputer for $800.

315
00:14:43,097 --> 00:14:44,630
Rym: Eh, $800, you're missing out on a lot of stuff.

316
00:14:45,312 --> 00:14:48,790
Rym: For about $1,500, you can get a really good case.

317
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:53,548
Rym: You can get a 4 GHz, 4 core Core i7, the best fucking Core i7.

318
00:14:54,491 --> 00:14:57,187
Rym: You can cool it enough to where it will actually run around 5 GHz.

319
00:14:58,996 --> 00:15:00,167
Rym: And you can get 64 GHz of RAM.

320
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,408
Scott: Are you going to start overclocking, Ram?

321
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:01,939
Scott: Huh?

322
00:15:02,231 --> 00:15:03,309
Scott: Are you going to overclock now?

323
00:15:03,831 --> 00:15:06,169
Rym: Uh, so, I was going to overclock this guy.

324
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:12,570
Rym: But because we were talking about the fact that the upper end Intel chips don't come with heatsinks anymore, I looked into why.

325
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:16,619
Rym: And the reality is, the 4 GHz i7 uses, like, 30 fucking more watts than the 3.4 GHz one.

326
00:15:21,372 --> 00:15:22,370
Scott: It's that much of a difference, right?

327
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:27,050
Rym: Yes, the difference is between 60 watts and 90 watts, or more.

328
00:15:27,751 --> 00:15:32,769
Rym: But, if you have a good cooler on a modern Intel chip, you can just overclock it.

329
00:15:33,171 --> 00:15:34,102
Rym: You can tell it, "Here's your

330
00:15:34,123 --> 00:15:34,325
Rym: limit."

331
00:15:34,971 --> 00:15:38,430
Rym: And it'll just go as fast as it can go, and if it starts getting too hot...

332
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:39,421
Scott: Oh, so you're not hacking it?

333
00:15:39,441 --> 00:15:40,149
Scott: It's, like, built in?

334
00:15:40,452 --> 00:15:40,541
Scott: Yeah.

335
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:41,670
Scott: Oh, that's interesting.

336
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,409
Rym: So, it's just a matter of cooling.

337
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:49,349
Rym: And I didn't realize how good this was until Emily has the same computer as me.

338
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:59,090
Rym: And some stuff was going real slow, and what we discovered was that one of her fans, like, her CPU had just, like... We realized the fan wasn't spinning at full speed, so we fixed it immediately.

339
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:05,370
Rym: But, instead of crashing, what her computer did is clocked itself down to, like, a gigahertz.

340
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:06,356
Scott: It's always been like that.

341
00:16:06,457 --> 00:16:14,069
Scott: Remember that video of the... They're playing Quake, and they have an Intel Pentium 4, and they have an Athlon, and they take the cooling off of both of them.

342
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,446
Scott: And the video's like, "Eh, eh,

343
00:16:15,466 --> 00:16:15,588
Scott: eh.".

344
00:16:15,811 --> 00:16:17,789
Scott: The Athlon chip, the magic smoke comes out.

345
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:22,330
Scott: The Intel chip, it just... Quake, like, goes down to zero FPS.

346
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:28,570
Scott: Then they put the heatsink back on the Pentium, and suddenly, Quake goes back up to 60 FPS or whatever it's at.

347
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,090
Rym: So they're way better than that now.

348
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:31,310
Scott: They've been doing that for a long time.

349
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:40,650
Rym: Our friend James just posted a picture of... He had taken the heatsink off of one of these chips recently to do some stuff, and he discovered that it had never actually made full contact.

350
00:16:41,093 --> 00:16:41,282
Scott: Whoa.

351
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:42,070
Rym: Ever.

352
00:16:42,551 --> 00:16:45,650
Rym: So, you know those three bands of goop that are on there?

353
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:46,618
Rym: Two of the bands?

354
00:16:46,962 --> 00:16:47,609
Rym: Unsmudged.

355
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:49,430
Scott: You didn't clamp it down hard enough?

356
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:52,710
Rym: No, for some reason it didn't seat fully.

357
00:16:53,171 --> 00:16:57,410
Rym: It was clamped all the way down, and the performance loss appears to have been negligible.

358
00:16:58,911 --> 00:17:04,270
Rym: But yeah, the reality is you need, actually, some serious aftermarket cooling if you want to use the upper-end Intel chips.

359
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,146
Rym: So if you buy the fastest i7...

360
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,670
Scott: Just get the water cooling pocket.

361
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,256
Rym: Yeah, actually, I was looking into that.

362
00:17:09,296 --> 00:17:11,769
Rym: So, instead of getting full water cooling, what you usually do...

363
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,790
Scott: I want you to spill water everywhere, and I want to laugh.

364
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:15,349
Rym: What I'm probably going to get is the thing where...

365
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:17,170
Scott: You're going to ruin your expensive equipment with water.

366
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:20,849
Rym: To get a heatsink that'll cool it well enough, it's kind of big and bulky and, like, blarg.

367
00:17:21,511 --> 00:17:26,329
Rym: You're actually better off getting these thin ones that look like a video card, and that's all the heatsink shit in there.

368
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:30,670
Rym: And there's just two heat pipes going to and from a little knob that just sits on top of the CPU.

369
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:41,110
Rym: Which used to be only the realm of overclockers, but it appears that this is now also the realm of, if you buy the highest-end Intel chips, you kind of just need it, or there was no reason...

370
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,730
Scott: Intel, why don't you just include that good chip?

371
00:17:43,252 --> 00:17:47,710
Rym: Because the kinds of people who buy that chip are doing nonsense overclocking anyway, and they just threw the Intel one away.

372
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:51,270
Scott: I think most consumers who are buying a chip on its own are doing nonsense.

373
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:54,669
Rym: They're not going to buy that one, because you can't buy that one with a cooler built in.

374
00:17:55,531 --> 00:17:57,264
Rym: They're going to buy the 3.4 GHz one.

375
00:17:57,304 --> 00:17:57,990
Rym: is going to be fine.

376
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,990
Rym: But anyway, things of the day!

377
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:11,403
Rym: You notice there's that common meme of "What if we did X, but we were

378
00:18:11,463 --> 00:18:11,864
Rym: honest?"

379
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,410
Rym: or, like, literal music videos.

380
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:18,610
Rym: This is one of those things, but it's really good, because usually those things don't pull a lot of punches.

381
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:22,590
Rym: They're usually kind of sardonic and negative about the thing that they're doing a fake ad about.

382
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:29,210
Rym: This one pulls so few punches, it's basically Mike Tyson telling you why you shouldn't fucking drink soda.

383
00:18:30,255 --> 00:18:30,989
Rym: It's really good.

384
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:42,790
Scott: Alright, so, one thing you can do in this world, if you don't have skills, or maybe you only have one skill, is to buy an expensive machine and make your living off of that expensive machine.

385
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,396
Scott: For example, laser cutter.

386
00:18:44,577 --> 00:18:44,898
Scott: Great!

387
00:18:45,139 --> 00:18:47,950
Scott: You know, you get a laser cutter, suddenly you got a business, right?

388
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:54,390
Scott: As soon as you pay for the laser cutter, most people need things laser cut, but not frequently enough that they would buy a fucking laser cutter.

389
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:58,950
Scott: So they come to you and they give you five bucks and you laser cut their shit or etch or whatever you're doing.

390
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,850
Rym: Like most people don't silk stream their own shirts.

391
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:04,530
Scott: The machine costs you a few thousand, but you pay that off pretty quickly and you're good to go.

392
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:11,590
Scott: So, this guy, I guess he works in a machine shop, and he has a YouTube channel, which is the Hydraulic Press Channel.

393
00:19:12,296 --> 00:19:13,770
Rym: Oh, I see where this is going.

394
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,392
Scott: He owns a hydraulic press.

395
00:19:15,853 --> 00:19:24,710
Scott: He seems to own other machines and makes money by using them, but he's now got an additional revenue stream, which is make videos of the hydraulic press, pressing things.

396
00:19:26,892 --> 00:19:28,869
Rym: Forget YouTube, that should just be like a TV show.

397
00:19:29,231 --> 00:19:36,830
Scott: Right, so, um, yeah, this channel currently has, let's see, uh, how many subscribers?

398
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:40,829
Scott: 157,000 and it's only like five months old.

399
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:46,523
Scott: And, uh, he posts, he's posting videos consistently like weekly.

400
00:19:46,864 --> 00:19:49,210
Scott: Some of these videos have millions of views.

401
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:53,510
Scott: In fact, he did one, Can You Fold Paper, more than seven times.

402
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:53,801
Scott: No way.

403
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,050
Scott: With hydraulic press.

404
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:55,809
Rym: There's no way.

405
00:19:56,051 --> 00:19:57,436
Scott: That one has seven million views.

406
00:19:57,476 --> 00:20:01,170
Scott: You can watch it and find out if you can fold paper more than seven times with hydraulic press.

407
00:20:02,571 --> 00:20:09,605
Scott: The best part about this is that, unlike that Will It Blend guy, whoever's doing this, number one, isn't selling anything.

408
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,947
Scott: He's not trying to sell hydraulic presses.

409
00:20:10,967 --> 00:20:12,370
Scott: He's just selling entertainment for free.

410
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:18,142
Scott: And two, he has funny accent, which might be Russian or other European style.

411
00:20:18,182 --> 00:20:21,270
Scott: that really, really adds to the videos and makes them hilarious.

412
00:20:22,411 --> 00:20:30,310
Rym: I did actually watch a few of them and his commentary and reaction when things go, shall we say, unexpectedly, makes it.

413
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:32,856
Scott: Yeah, this is like the most excellent channel.

414
00:20:32,876 --> 00:20:33,738
Scott: You can get in early.

415
00:20:33,778 --> 00:20:34,820
Scott: I mean, we're not super early.

416
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:38,550
Scott: Some of these videos have seven million views, but it's only at five months old.

417
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:40,834
Scott: So, uh, I subscribed.

418
00:20:40,874 --> 00:20:44,082
Scott: I'm gonna watch every single thing he presses with his hydraulic press.

419
00:20:44,182 --> 00:20:47,410
Scott: Also, don't put your fingers near a hydraulic press, good guy.

420
00:20:47,591 --> 00:20:49,159
Rym: Yeah, he's just holding the stuff under it.

421
00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:50,385
Rym: I guess you have a lot of fine control.

422
00:20:50,425 --> 00:20:51,210
Rym: It doesn't move fast.

423
00:20:51,952 --> 00:20:53,970
Scott: Uh, it moves fast as you move the lever.

424
00:20:55,052 --> 00:20:55,659
Rym: Uh, does it?

425
00:20:55,983 --> 00:20:56,610
Rym: Is it proportional?

426
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:59,889
Scott: Listen, I don't want to know any more about it than I have to.

427
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:03,433
Scott: Dangerous machine, stay away.

428
00:21:03,493 --> 00:21:04,616
Scott: This is another good thing.

429
00:21:04,636 --> 00:21:10,330
Scott: A machine that's dangerous is not something a lot of people want, so you can sell usage of it if you know how to use it properly.

430
00:21:10,832 --> 00:21:11,375
Rym: Oh, man.

431
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:14,610
Rym: I feel like I'm just gonna binge watch this entire channel.

432
00:21:14,751 --> 00:21:16,301
Scott: There's not a lot to watch so far.

433
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:17,590
Scott: It's only a few months old, right?

434
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:18,293
Rym: Yeah, not bad.

435
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,710
Rym: It's like when we got in on Strong Bad in those early days.

436
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:26,690
Scott: Yeah, the newest one he posted just today is Hockey Puck, and that's how I found it, because our hockey linked to this Hockey Puck one.

437
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:28,857
Scott: That was real interesting.

438
00:21:30,506 --> 00:21:31,270
Scott: Very interesting.

439
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:35,330
Rym: In the meta moment, we're gonna be at Anime Boston this weekend.

440
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:38,398
Rym: It's probably going to be our last Anime Boston.

441
00:21:38,418 --> 00:21:42,390
Rym: You can go to the forum to find out why that's the case, but that's neither here nor there.

442
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:44,178
Rym: Friday, two panels.

443
00:21:44,419 --> 00:21:46,290
Rym: Roleplaying anime, judge anime by its cover.

444
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:52,630
Rym: Saturday, how to run an anime club, more foreign anime openers, which for those of you who have seen us do foreign anime openers.

445
00:21:52,893 --> 00:21:53,307
Scott: It's the same.

446
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:53,891
Rym: Nope.

447
00:21:53,891 --> 00:21:55,059
Rym: 95% new content.

448
00:21:57,331 --> 00:21:59,570
Rym: The only things I reuse, I'll tell you straight up.

449
00:21:59,912 --> 00:22:02,528
Rym: I reuse Italian One Piece and German Sailor Moon, because come on.

450
00:22:02,952 --> 00:22:04,329
Scott: What about Captain Harlock?

451
00:22:04,631 --> 00:22:05,750
Rym: I left out the captain.

452
00:22:06,132 --> 00:22:06,274
Scott: No!

453
00:22:06,639 --> 00:22:07,450
Scott: This panel's ruined.

454
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,956
Rym: However, I'm gonna poll the audience.

455
00:22:10,437 --> 00:22:14,910
Rym: If the far majority of the audience has never seen this panel, fuck it, I'm just showing the regular version.

456
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:19,708
Scott: The one person who's looking for new stuff will be like,

457
00:22:20,009 --> 00:22:20,090
Scott: "Aww.".

458
00:22:20,691 --> 00:22:29,290
Rym: So the way I frame this is what I'm gonna do at ConnectiCon and any other cons we go to is on Friday, I'm gonna do part one and on Saturday, part two.

459
00:22:29,911 --> 00:22:37,550
Rym: This is a panel I'm gonna take on the roadshow now because a little bird just told me that that kind of panel would be totally accepted and scheduled at MAGFest.

460
00:22:38,296 --> 00:22:38,587
Scott: Oh, really?

461
00:22:39,912 --> 00:22:40,342
Scott: I guess.

462
00:22:40,404 --> 00:22:40,629
Scott: Sure.

463
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:42,722
Rym: Also, they just do whatever people want.

464
00:22:42,742 --> 00:22:43,687
Rym: MAGFest is a festival.

465
00:22:43,728 --> 00:22:44,090
Rym: Go nuts.

466
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:45,578
Scott: I thought they had like a, "Oh, right.

467
00:22:45,598 --> 00:22:46,303
Scott: Didn't they lose their

468
00:22:46,344 --> 00:22:46,949
Scott: nonprofit?".

469
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:49,340
Rym: They're a non-profit, but they're a festival.

470
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,149
Rym: Music and fan culture and awesome stuff.

471
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:51,852
Scott: Okay.

472
00:22:51,892 --> 00:22:53,350
Scott: It's not part of their charter, Anime Openers.

473
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:55,630
Rym: MAGFest actually is doing a lot of things right.

474
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:56,392
Scott: Alright.

475
00:22:56,432 --> 00:22:58,850
Scott: Well, it didn't fail this year, so good job, MAGFest.

476
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:01,110
Scott: It was actually a- You exceeded expectations.

477
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,710
Rym: It was an above average MAGFest for me.

478
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,066
Scott: I golf clap you.

479
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:05,430
Scott: And I will come to you again next year.

480
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:10,327
Rym: The weekend right after Anime Boston, we are going to be at ZenkaiCon, or at least I'm going to be at ZenkaiCon.

481
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:11,070
Scott: Scott's waffling.

482
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:12,068
Scott: I don't really wanna go there.

483
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:14,560
Rym: If you go, Chris and Anthony are gonna be in the room with us.

484
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,710
Rym: We're just gonna play four player games the entire time.

485
00:23:16,811 --> 00:23:17,742
Scott: George is looking for a room.

486
00:23:17,782 --> 00:23:18,430
Scott: Let him have my spot.

487
00:23:20,352 --> 00:23:20,956
Rym: Oh, yeah.

488
00:23:21,057 --> 00:23:23,415
Rym: But if George probably wants to bring other people, if you don't come- No, he said.

489
00:23:23,476 --> 00:23:24,630
Scott: I think he was looking for just himself.

490
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:25,757
Rym: Oh, if it's just himself.

491
00:23:25,817 --> 00:23:26,220
Rym: Alright.

492
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,470
Rym: I'll follow up on that.

493
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:31,066
Rym: But yes, we'll be at ZenkaiCon, or at least I'll be there doing a ton of panels.

494
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:31,910
Rym: I forget what.

495
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,295
Rym: I guess I just look at what I'm doing there.

496
00:23:33,395 --> 00:23:35,583
Rym: But Saturday and Sunday only.

497
00:23:35,644 --> 00:23:36,306
Rym: Nothing on Friday.

498
00:23:36,326 --> 00:23:37,210
Rym: I'm not taking a day off work.

499
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:42,550
Rym: And then PAX East is coming up like right after that with Atari game design.

500
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:49,190
Rym: Let me tell ya, I watched the video of us doing this at PAX South because I was thinking about putting it on YouTube.

501
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:52,220
Rym: And this panel's actually amazing to watch.

502
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,450
Rym: So we're gonna record it at PAX East.

503
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:55,528
Scott: Didn't feel amazing to do.

504
00:23:56,231 --> 00:23:58,429
Rym: It's real, real funny to watch.

505
00:23:58,716 --> 00:23:58,886
Scott: Anyway.

506
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:01,075
Rym: And people seem to really like it.

507
00:24:01,155 --> 00:24:05,390
Rym: So we're probably gonna record the definitive version at PAX East, having practiced it a bunch.

508
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,153
Scott: Other meta things.

509
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:13,126
Scott: So in case you didn't know, we are everywhere there is on the internet.

510
00:24:13,467 --> 00:24:14,510
Scott: You can find us there.

511
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:17,090
Rym: We have a subreddit that no one uses?

512
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:20,868
Scott: I'm sure there's tumbles and tweets and Facebooks.

513
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:22,019
Rym: Do we have a tumbler?

514
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,850
Rym: I don't think we have a tumbler.

515
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:23,670
Scott: I thought you made one at one point.

516
00:24:23,751 --> 00:24:25,009
Rym: I stopped that a long time ago.

517
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:25,929
Scott: I'm just saying it exists.

518
00:24:26,971 --> 00:24:30,249
Rym: In fact, the stuff I used to post in the tumbler is all going in the Patreon now.

519
00:24:31,695 --> 00:24:32,549
Scott: I guess that exists too.

520
00:24:33,152 --> 00:24:39,550
Rym: But the Patreon, so you guys know, 90% of all the content that we do is on the Patreon for free.

521
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:41,250
Rym: So you can just follow it without giving us money.

522
00:24:42,152 --> 00:24:46,070
Rym: You only have to give us money if you want to get the Rym's Rants, the Rimly Reviews with Rym and Emily.

523
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:49,106
Scott: But if you don't pay money, you can't see the Patreon at all.

524
00:24:49,146 --> 00:24:49,810
Scott: You can't see anything.

525
00:24:50,431 --> 00:24:52,679
Scott: I think without logging in, you can see all the non-public content.

526
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:57,749
Scott: I'm logged in without paying and I can't see anything.

527
00:24:58,032 --> 00:24:58,609
Rym: Anything at all?

528
00:24:58,732 --> 00:24:58,818
Scott: Nope.

529
00:24:59,454 --> 00:24:59,729
Rym: Nothing?

530
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:00,128
Rym: Nope.

531
00:25:00,271 --> 00:25:03,446
Rym: That's interesting because if I link to a page that's public...

532
00:25:04,411 --> 00:25:08,688
Scott: Whenever I click on any of your links, even if I'm logged in, it says, "Oh, you're not paying for this.

533
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:08,989
Scott: You can't

534
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:09,150
Scott: see.".

535
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:09,632
Rym: Are you sure?

536
00:25:09,652 --> 00:25:12,590
Rym: Because almost all the links I post are the not-public links.

537
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:13,233
Scott: Oh, maybe.

538
00:25:13,273 --> 00:25:15,550
Scott: I'll have to check again, but I'm pretty sure I can't see shit.

539
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:16,862
Rym: I'll send you a link to something.

540
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:17,650
Rym: We'll see if you can see it.

541
00:25:17,813 --> 00:25:18,028
Scott: All right.

542
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:21,550
Rym: Anyway, we're getting real close because a few people just gave us a bunch of money.

543
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:30,750
Rym: We're $40 away from that stretch goal where I'm going to release, with commentary and remastering, every beta episode of GeekNights before we went live.

544
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:32,490
Scott: Stop giving him money for no reason.

545
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:39,788
Rym: Also, it might be enough money if it continues to occur in levels to where we'll just fucking go to PAX Australia like you guys were all asking us to.

546
00:25:41,372 --> 00:25:43,570
Scott: Or I'll spend it on a different vacation.

547
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:47,650
Rym: No, you don't get to go on vacation with the Patreon money unless you do GeekNights content.

548
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:49,143
Scott: They're stupid enough to give us their money.

549
00:25:49,163 --> 00:25:49,890
Scott: I'll do whatever I want.

550
00:25:50,492 --> 00:25:52,570
Rym: No, then I'll go to Australia and make content.

551
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:54,803
Scott: You have more money than me, so I should get the money.

552
00:25:54,843 --> 00:25:55,750
Scott: It's called equality.

553
00:25:55,911 --> 00:25:59,910
Rym: My goal is actually to not be working for a company.

554
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:05,510
Scott: I told them not to give, and they did, so I'm the one who gets to punish them for their mistake.

555
00:26:07,012 --> 00:26:09,722
Rym: There was one person, Scott, who did lower their pledge.

556
00:26:09,762 --> 00:26:11,348
Rym: They're like, "I thought a lot about what Scott

557
00:26:11,368 --> 00:26:11,629
Rym: said.".

558
00:26:12,035 --> 00:26:12,469
Scott: Yeah.

559
00:26:12,951 --> 00:26:16,532
Rym: And he lowered his pledge from $6 to $5.

560
00:26:16,532 --> 00:26:17,985
Scott: God damn it.

561
00:26:18,005 --> 00:26:18,490
Scott: So dumb.

562
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:23,230
Rym: But seriously, if money's a problem for you, don't fucking give us money.

563
00:26:23,371 --> 00:26:25,609
Scott: Oh my god, Rube actually said not to give money for once.

564
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:29,190
Rym: If a dollar a month actually makes a difference in your life...

565
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:32,539
Scott: It makes a difference for me, so if you make less money than me, you shouldn't be... A dollar a month?

566
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:33,270
Scott: You can't even buy a bagel.

567
00:26:33,632 --> 00:26:34,669
Rym: That's a whole bagel.

568
00:26:35,652 --> 00:26:36,217
Rym: A bagel a month?

569
00:26:36,257 --> 00:26:36,782
Rym: No, it's not.

570
00:26:36,802 --> 00:26:37,790
Rym: Not where I am, downtown.

571
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,647
Scott: I got my bodega right near me.

572
00:26:39,667 --> 00:26:39,910
Scott: Dollar bagel.

573
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:42,909
Rym: Yeah, Scott, for a dollar... I can get a steamed bagel.

574
00:26:43,931 --> 00:26:45,690
Scott: I can get a boiled bagel for a dollar.

575
00:26:45,791 --> 00:26:47,770
Rym: I can't get a boiled bagel for a dollar near my office.

576
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:49,621
Scott: The bagels of the bodega, real good.

577
00:26:49,681 --> 00:26:50,508
Scott: Toasted with butter.

578
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:50,830
Scott: Dollar.

579
00:26:51,072 --> 00:26:52,282
Rym: Oh, you're toasting a fresh bagel?

580
00:26:52,302 --> 00:26:53,170
Rym: What the fuck, Scott?

581
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:53,969
Scott: Who says it's fresh?

582
00:26:54,873 --> 00:26:56,561
Rym: Oh, okay, okay, okay.

583
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:58,550
Rym: I was imagining, like, a hot and crusty bagel.

584
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:00,064
Scott: I can tell I'm not to toast.

585
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:03,630
Rym: I mean, the hot and crusty bagel's like $2.15.

586
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:05,759
Scott: Also, you know, well, I do agree.

587
00:27:05,779 --> 00:27:07,245
Scott: You don't toast the fresh bagel.

588
00:27:09,111 --> 00:27:13,649
Scott: I do like it to be warm, like it's out of the oven, and if it's been out of the oven for more than a few hours, you can at least warm it.

589
00:27:13,953 --> 00:27:14,530
Scott: Oh, true, true.

590
00:27:14,731 --> 00:27:15,458
Scott: Toast it lightly.

591
00:27:15,518 --> 00:27:16,830
Scott: Don't, you know, char it.

592
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:19,610
Rym: Yeah, the thing is, I like it a little char, like just a tiny bit.

593
00:27:19,711 --> 00:27:22,989
Scott: Anyway, also, uh, I remembered to do the newsletter again.

594
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,569
Rym: Yeah, the newsletter's just super good, guys.

595
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:30,410
Scott: And I put in my "remember" thing to send it out at the end of the month, which is soon, so I guess I had to think of something to say.

596
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:32,590
Rym: Subscribe to the GeekNights' newsletter, honestly.

597
00:27:32,791 --> 00:27:34,762
Scott: It's free, unlike some bullshit Patreon.

598
00:27:34,782 --> 00:27:36,169
Scott: I'm gonna do more free stuff soon, too.

599
00:27:36,431 --> 00:27:38,210
Rym: You know, you said that when I started the Patreon.

600
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,610
Scott: It takes a long time to do stuff.

601
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:41,740
Rym: Oh, it takes a long time to do stuff.

602
00:27:42,001 --> 00:27:43,730
Rym: It's effort, it's a lot of work to do stuff.

603
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:44,823
Scott: Also, the sun's not out.

604
00:27:44,843 --> 00:27:45,390
Scott: It makes it hard.

605
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:49,390
Scott: Yeah, actually, the only reason- All the things that I thought about doing, I need the sun to be out and I need it to be warm.

606
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:54,810
Rym: So guys, the real test of the Patreon will be if I continue this high level of output when it's warm.

607
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:59,088
Scott: I think you're gonna see the output flip when it's warm, 'cause I'm just gonna go outside and bring the camera with me.

608
00:27:59,617 --> 00:27:59,810
Scott: Yeah.

609
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,610
Scott: And make some videos and shit outside.

610
00:28:02,876 --> 00:28:04,170
Scott: Uh, so yeah, there's that.

611
00:28:04,452 --> 00:28:05,370
Scott: Oh, what's the book club?

612
00:28:05,811 --> 00:28:09,250
Rym: The book club is gonna be, uh, Oryx and Craig, Margaret Atwood.

613
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:11,890
Scott: So I'm just gonna say it is, and I'm gonna read it now, 'cause I need something to read.

614
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:14,830
Rym: No, but I gotta- Randall Atoor is doing some shit, so I gotta find out what's going on with that.

615
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,209
Scott: Well, I'm gonna start reading the other thing first.

616
00:28:16,671 --> 00:28:25,570
Rym: So Scott, I don't wanna spoil stuff for you, but someone might have tried to clean the mail half of the source.

617
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:26,784
Scott: Good job.

618
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:27,220
Scott: Yeah.

619
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:27,870
Scott: A plus.

620
00:28:28,533 --> 00:28:29,550
Rym: And we'll see what's happening.

621
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:31,090
Scott: They almost definitely failed though, right?

622
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:39,990
Rym: So all I'm gonna say is that basically this whole book is all, like it goes around every character you can imagine around the entire world.

623
00:28:40,311 --> 00:28:45,188
Rym: And they're in the middle of their crazy thing and then suddenly they're all like, "What the fuck is going on way off in the

624
00:28:45,228 --> 00:28:45,630
Rym: distance?".

625
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:47,049
Rym: They can all feel it.

626
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:52,130
Scott: Listen, if they clean it up, then like all those messed up dudes will suddenly be not messed up, and it'll be totally awesome.

627
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:52,755
Scott: Yeah, maybe.

628
00:28:52,775 --> 00:28:53,830
Rym: So stuff's going down with The Wheel of Time.

629
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:57,110
Scott: But they're almost definitely gonna fail, 'cause that would be pretty lame if they just succeeded so easily.

630
00:28:57,170 --> 00:29:01,710
Rym: So I'm not gonna start reading Oryx and Craig until I at least finish the current Wheel of Time book I'm in.

631
00:29:01,811 --> 00:29:02,950
Scott: I'm gonna read Oryx and Craig starting tonight.

632
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:03,990
Rym: Which is book 11.

633
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:07,850
Scott: Actually, no, I'm gonna finish reading Astroboy Omnibus 1 and 2, then I'm gonna read Oryx and Craig.

634
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:10,090
Rym: Alright, by then I should be done with my current Wheel of Time book.

635
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:11,470
Scott: I only have like one chapter left.

636
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:17,079
Rym: And the last thing I'm gonna announce right now, I'm going to make a documentary on my Civilization V empire.

637
00:29:17,821 --> 00:29:23,390
Rym: in this giant public game we're playing, but I am not going to post it until the game is done, 'cause there are spies.

638
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:26,849
Rym: I mean, Scott won't even let me see his games.

639
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:27,607
Scott: There's nothing to see.

640
00:29:28,232 --> 00:29:28,929
Rym: You want me to help you?

641
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:32,930
Scott: You're gonna see two cities and two really good spots where there should be cities, but there aren't.

642
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:38,270
Rym: Scott, if you send me one gold a month in-game, I will look at your game and give you real advice.

643
00:29:38,471 --> 00:29:41,150
Scott: I'm only making a gold a turn.

644
00:29:41,695 --> 00:29:41,776
Rym: Oh.

645
00:29:41,796 --> 00:29:43,290
Rym: Well, you can give me that gold.

646
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:44,689
Scott: No, I need that gold.

647
00:29:45,272 --> 00:29:46,868
Rym: Do you have anything else you can give me, like some horses?

648
00:29:48,012 --> 00:29:49,189
Scott: I have horses, they're my horses.

649
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:50,550
Rym: What are you gonna use them for?

650
00:29:50,712 --> 00:29:51,329
Scott: A horse man.

651
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:53,610
Rym: You're gonna make one horse man, and that one gold is gone.

652
00:29:55,891 --> 00:29:56,896
Scott: I can get the improvement.

653
00:29:56,916 --> 00:29:59,970
Scott: that's like no upkeep on X number of dudes.

654
00:30:00,753 --> 00:30:01,318
Rym: What upkeep?

655
00:30:01,338 --> 00:30:02,870
Rym: What do you mean, the policy?

656
00:30:03,197 --> 00:30:03,282
Scott: Yeah.

657
00:30:03,631 --> 00:30:04,548
Rym: Oh yeah, you can do that.

658
00:30:05,815 --> 00:30:07,970
Rym: You should probably do that one with the size of your empire.

659
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:08,750
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

660
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:09,990
Rym: That'll protect you later.

661
00:30:10,111 --> 00:30:10,609
Scott: It's a good one.

662
00:30:11,312 --> 00:30:12,850
Rym: Anyway, Tech News Roundup.

663
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:18,290
Rym: I thought we should just do news like this as every Monday episode, but Scott seems to disagree.

664
00:30:18,891 --> 00:30:21,210
Scott: Tech News Roundup too often turns this into not GeekNights.

665
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:23,510
Scott: We need topics, so send Monday topics.

666
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:26,890
Scott: They have to be about technology, not about law relating to technology.

667
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,555
Scott: They're not about business.

668
00:30:28,595 --> 00:30:32,390
Scott: that happens to be technology companies, actually about technology.

669
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:42,030
Rym: So there's this company, Boom Aerospace, whatever they're called, but basically the deal is they think they can bring back supersonic air travel.

670
00:30:42,697 --> 00:30:43,390
Scott: Oh, like the Concorde.

671
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:43,782
Scott: Yes.

672
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:50,677
Rym: They basically want to make Concorde 2 explode-y boogaloo, and they think- What's their plan?

673
00:30:50,697 --> 00:30:52,430
Scott: I'm Skep, obviously.

674
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:53,922
Rym: Well, the technology exists.

675
00:30:53,942 --> 00:30:56,583
Scott: I mean, the Concorde existed- Yes, I know the technology exists.

676
00:30:56,623 --> 00:30:57,450
Scott: That's not in question.

677
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:00,428
Rym: So their plan is basically a lot like the Concorde's.

678
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:01,857
Rym: Business class only.

679
00:31:01,877 --> 00:31:03,890
Rym: It costs the same as business class.

680
00:31:04,272 --> 00:31:07,647
Rym: It's as comfortable as coach, but it gets you there in an hour or two.

681
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:17,790
Rym: So with the technology they're going to use, which is just modern technology- So just newer than a Concorde, better jets than what a Concorde has.

682
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,709
Rym: Yes, like material science has actually come a long way.

683
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,625
Scott: Concorde's are way old, like from the '70s.

684
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:27,250
Rym: New York to London would take three hours and 24 minutes and cost about five grand round trip.

685
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:28,508
Scott: That's not bad.

686
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:30,910
Rym: Now, here's why I'm skeptical.

687
00:31:31,453 --> 00:31:32,390
Scott: Obviously still skeptical.

688
00:31:33,112 --> 00:31:38,270
Rym: A business class, like when I fly business class to London, it's way comfortable.

689
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:44,950
Rym: Like I have a lay down bed, like super good food, and it only takes like six hours.

690
00:31:46,351 --> 00:31:49,085
Rym: So it'll only save me a couple hours.

691
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:50,150
Rym: That's actually not worth it.

692
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:51,389
Scott: They got to go faster.

693
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:53,548
Rym: Yeah, but they're already going back too.

694
00:31:54,571 --> 00:31:57,861
Rym: And also one of the main reasons you can't go that much faster- Why can't it go like SR-71 fast?

695
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:01,029
Rym: Because then it'll have like one seat.

696
00:32:02,573 --> 00:32:04,449
Scott: We can't make one that's big, that's like the same shape.

697
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:07,030
Scott: Just put two more engines on it?

698
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:13,990
Rym: So the problems you start to run into are one, they generate so much heat that they have to fly higher and higher to have less atmosphere.

699
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:16,470
Scott: Well, you're wearing basically a space suit in one of those things anyway.

700
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:19,809
Rym: So the higher and higher they go, the more energy they need to get up there.

701
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:22,830
Scott: Listen, if you tell me I'm going to be in Japan in an hour, I'm wearing the space suit.

702
00:32:22,991 --> 00:32:24,269
Scott: And I don't care how uncomfortable it is.

703
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:27,827
Scott: You can put me in a capsule in the bomb bay or some shit, right?

704
00:32:27,868 --> 00:32:28,310
Scott: I don't care.

705
00:32:28,851 --> 00:32:38,070
Rym: Yeah, but it comes down to they actually have to go slow when they're over land because they're so loud- As the famous double sonic boom.

706
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:39,850
Rym: Yeah, they'll actually be disruptive.

707
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:40,565
Scott: Two booms.

708
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:42,040
Rym: Two booms, no rooms.

709
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:50,790
Rym: You realize, Scott, that a supersonic plane actually going super fast, it's not just like there's one sonic boom and then you're good.

710
00:32:51,452 --> 00:32:54,370
Rym: It's constantly sonic booming over and over and over and over again.

711
00:32:55,032 --> 00:32:55,950
Scott: I'm well aware.

712
00:32:56,632 --> 00:33:01,990
Rym: And it's so loud on the ground, even when you're way high up, that that's a problem.

713
00:33:02,671 --> 00:33:05,249
Rym: So they can't use them over land.

714
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:09,650
Scott: If there's one airplane nerds know about, it's the Blackbird.

715
00:33:10,635 --> 00:33:12,009
Scott: Even if you're not an airplane nerd.

716
00:33:12,471 --> 00:33:15,030
Rym: SR-71 is probably the coolest airplane ever made.

717
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:17,070
Scott: Every nerd knows about this one plane.

718
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:21,469
Rym: Except apparently the SR-71 Blackbird has seats for all the X-Men in it.

719
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:21,996
Scott: Yes.

720
00:33:23,115 --> 00:33:24,270
Scott: And like a medical bay.

721
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:24,373
Rym: Yeah.

722
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:27,842
Rym: No, in reality, that thing had seats for like what, two people?

723
00:33:28,204 --> 00:33:28,887
Rym: One person?

724
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:29,390
Rym: Not a lot.

725
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:30,902
Scott: I think two people could be in it, for sure.

726
00:33:31,084 --> 00:33:31,810
Scott: At least two people.

727
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:37,470
Rym: I think there is a future for supersonic travel, but I do not think that future is now.

728
00:33:37,911 --> 00:33:40,690
Rym: And I think the limitations are energy costs and economics.

729
00:33:41,611 --> 00:33:44,570
Rym: It's not worth it to get to London a couple hours faster.

730
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:50,510
Scott: No, I think, you know, personally, I think we'd be much better off with just like bullet trains.

731
00:33:50,671 --> 00:33:54,169
Scott: They go 500 miles an hour, which is about what regular planes that we have now go.

732
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:55,889
Scott: It's not really that much slower.

733
00:33:57,172 --> 00:34:00,730
Scott: And you don't have to go deal with airport bullshit because you're just in a train.

734
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:02,510
Scott: It goes choo choo, but it doesn't even go choo choo.

735
00:34:03,972 --> 00:34:05,037
Rym: I mean, we've talked about this.

736
00:34:05,057 --> 00:34:15,270
Rym: If we had bullet trains in New York, like between like all the way up and down, like the good part of New York on the east side, then you could live in Albany and commute to Manhattan.

737
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:18,889
Scott: I don't think it's infeasible to make a train to London from New York that goes over the ocean.

738
00:34:20,237 --> 00:34:22,790
Rym: I will withhold my judgment on the feasibility of that.

739
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:26,226
Scott: Listen, I'm saying that would be like the greatest engineering project of the 21st century.

740
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:29,050
Scott: It's an enormous thing, but I'm saying it's not impossible.

741
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,589
Scott: We could definitely do it if we wanted to.

742
00:34:31,612 --> 00:34:34,027
Scott: It would be easier to do that than it would be to go to Mars.

743
00:34:36,333 --> 00:34:37,668
Rym: Yeah, I might agree with that.

744
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:45,322
Scott: And I think we can do both things within the level that is possible, the things that humans can achieve.

745
00:34:45,424 --> 00:34:45,869
Scott: We can do it.

746
00:34:46,493 --> 00:34:49,090
Scott: If we wanted to and people paid money for it, it could happen.

747
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:53,710
Rym: I withhold my judgment on the feasibility of a New York to London train.

748
00:34:55,072 --> 00:35:00,150
Scott: The only problem I would have is if something happens on the train in the middle of the ocean.

749
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:01,850
Rym: Planes have that problem already.

750
00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:04,789
Scott: Yes, but a plane, you can like jump out.

751
00:35:05,551 --> 00:35:06,254
Scott: No, you can't.

752
00:35:06,274 --> 00:35:09,750
Rym: There are not parachutes on like the 777.

753
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:12,550
Scott: A plane also becomes a boat at some point.

754
00:35:13,693 --> 00:35:15,710
Rym: So why can't the train become a boat just the same?

755
00:35:15,811 --> 00:35:17,081
Scott: Because it's on like this rail.

756
00:35:17,101 --> 00:35:18,190
Scott: You're stuck on this rail.

757
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:20,449
Scott: You're going to go down the ladder into the ocean and get on a boat.

758
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:21,834
Scott: Actually, that's not a bad idea.

759
00:35:21,854 --> 00:35:25,150
Scott: You could have boats like on the pillars holding the thing up every once in a while.

760
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:26,034
Scott: Oh, pillars.

761
00:35:26,196 --> 00:35:27,790
Rym: You're not thinking a tube under the water?

762
00:35:28,852 --> 00:35:29,570
Scott: Oh, nice.

763
00:35:30,531 --> 00:35:32,909
Scott: If that thing cracks, like some whale bumps into it.

764
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:48,990
Rym: So I guess I'm really excited about all these alternate transport things, but I feel like international travel, like long distance travel being that much shorter, is not the bang for its buck that making mid-regional transport faster would be.

765
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:51,770
Scott: Let's just make a New York to LA train first and then worry about London.

766
00:35:51,911 --> 00:35:52,496
Rym: New York to LA.

767
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:54,030
Rym: I'm talking just northeastern corridor.

768
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:57,590
Rym: That's all you need for the vast majority of America's GDP.

769
00:35:58,011 --> 00:35:59,745
Scott: Sure, but I'm saying 500 miles an hour to LA.

770
00:35:59,765 --> 00:36:00,269
Scott: That's good shit.

771
00:36:01,431 --> 00:36:03,665
Rym: Eh, that's not that much faster than planes.

772
00:36:03,706 --> 00:36:04,209
Rym: I'd probably still fly.

773
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:10,228
Scott: I'm saying it's plane speed-ish basically, but you don't have to go bother with planes and it could fill a lot more people in it.

774
00:36:10,819 --> 00:36:11,390
Scott: Eh, maybe.

775
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:12,269
Scott: You can fill it with people.

776
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:13,590
Rym: Depends on where you put it.

777
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:14,530
Scott: It can be way long.

778
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:17,550
Rym: Also, that right-of-way, god, you're gonna have some eminent domain problems.

779
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:23,410
Scott: Uh, most of that, once you get past, like, you know, the East Coast, there's plenty of open fucking space.

780
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:24,817
Rym: Anyway, you got a news?

781
00:36:24,938 --> 00:36:26,590
Rym: I guess let's just alternate until we run out of news.

782
00:36:26,931 --> 00:36:27,990
Scott: Okay, let's talk about Apple News.

783
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:29,301
Rym: Oh, that's a cheater.

784
00:36:29,321 --> 00:36:30,169
Rym: That's like eight newses.

785
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:30,736
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

786
00:36:30,756 --> 00:36:31,789
Scott: I'm gonna do all eight newses now.

787
00:36:32,371 --> 00:36:33,655
Scott: Apple News #1.

788
00:36:33,655 --> 00:36:37,047
Scott: The iWatch is actually, they came out with a watch band for it.

789
00:36:37,067 --> 00:36:37,830
Scott: that's actually kind of nice.

790
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:45,630
Scott: That's the watch band I would get if I was gonna get an iWatch and I didn't have a Pebble Watch because it's really similar to the band I have in my Pebble Watch.

791
00:36:46,091 --> 00:36:48,670
Rym: Yeah, so they also brought the price down.

792
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:51,370
Scott: Yeah, so the price down is actually a big deal.

793
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:56,750
Scott: It basically is acknowledgement that, oh shit, the Pebble is competition and the iWatch isn't enticing enough.

794
00:36:57,070 --> 00:37:00,050
Rym: Yeah, because the Pebble does, like, 80% of what the iWatch does.

795
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:03,750
Rym: The battery lasts ten days and it costs a fraction of what the iWatch costs.

796
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:07,270
Scott: I'm telling you, everything Apple does, version one is always not worth getting.

797
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:12,230
Scott: Would you get iPhone, look at the difference between iPhone 1 and iPhone 3G, which is basically iPhone 2.

798
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:16,810
Scott: The difference is huge, way bigger than the difference between any other two consecutive iPhones, right?

799
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:23,230
Rym: Well, I'll tell you, I might have gotten the iWatch 1 if I had unlimited money and didn't give a shit.

800
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:27,970
Scott: Sure, iWatch 2 is gonna be a drastic, drastic improvement over iWatch 1.

801
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:31,190
Scott: I might get it, but I'm probably gonna wait for iWatch 3 or 4.

802
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:44,050
Scott: Like, when this Pebble Watch dies and is no longer good anymore, when Pebble time is no longer good enough, doesn't get it done, by that time there will be an iWatch that is so great, like, way thin and hella sick, and I'll get that.

803
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:47,002
Rym: But look at this, I mean, it's $300 now for an iWatch.

804
00:37:47,403 --> 00:37:49,450
Rym: The Pebble time steal is $250.

805
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:50,189
Scott: Yeah, it's not bad.

806
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:55,190
Rym: Now, I do think the Pebble is actually superior to the iWatch because, what?

807
00:37:55,290 --> 00:38:01,550
Scott: It's not superior in features or screen, but it is superior in the, it actually lasts a lot, the battery doesn't die.

808
00:38:01,611 --> 00:38:03,629
Rym: I would say it is superior in screen because...

809
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:06,010
Scott: The battery doesn't die and the screen is always on.

810
00:38:06,151 --> 00:38:09,970
Rym: Yeah, because the screen is full color, well, not full color, but it's a lot of color.

811
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:17,950
Scott: It's always on, you can just look at it, you don't have to, like, shake, it's not black, and then you shake it and you see something, it's, I can see something, and if I shake it, the LED light turns on.

812
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:22,130
Rym: Yeah, and that makes it abjectly superior in my mind.

813
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:23,070
Scott: Yes, it is great.

814
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:29,110
Rym: And also, the only feature is the iWatch, like, the iWatch has a little bit better integration because you obviously have an iPhone, or, why do you have an iWatch?

815
00:38:29,711 --> 00:38:33,310
Rym: And it does navigation better because it just works, like, walking in transit and everything.

816
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:34,029
Scott: And the graphics are better.

817
00:38:34,571 --> 00:38:49,730
Rym: Like, to make navigation work on your Pebble, you have to pay for some guy's app, and the app is fine, but it doesn't do a lot of UX things that the iWatch does way better, but that is not enough of a reason to get an iWatch instead of a Pebble.

818
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:50,248
Scott: Yeah, no.

819
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:54,490
Rym: Also, the Pebble, I assume the iWatch is waterproof because the Pebble is waterproof.

820
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:55,414
Scott: Yeah, anyway, Apple News #2.

821
00:38:55,414 --> 00:38:55,857
Scott: Small iPhone.

822
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:01,726
Rym: Yup, we predicted this, all the rumors were basically 100% true.

823
00:39:02,871 --> 00:39:13,290
Scott: Now, what shocked me the most, though, is that, according to the presentation that they gave, this new, smaller iPhone SE, which is basically the size of an iPhone 5, effectively the perfect size.

824
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:18,950
Scott: I still like iPhone 4 size, but I am not going to look the gift horse of iPhone 5 size in the mouth.

825
00:39:19,351 --> 00:39:28,449
Scott: This iPhone 5, well, iPhone SE, is basically technologically identical to the iPhone 6S.

826
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:30,269
Rym: Except for a couple things.

827
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:36,790
Scott: Except for, it basically has the same CPU, the same, right, the screen is smaller, but otherwise, it's like, just as good.

828
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:39,687
Scott: And I'm like, wow, I thought it was going to be as strong as the iPhone 6, not 6S.

829
00:39:40,731 --> 00:39:41,589
Scott: So now, here's the thing.

830
00:39:42,771 --> 00:39:46,772
Scott: In September, six months from now, they're going to come out with iPhone 7.

831
00:39:46,772 --> 00:39:50,850
Rym: And rumors imply that the iPhone 7 is a leap forward.

832
00:39:51,493 --> 00:39:52,128
Rym: Or at least a leap.

833
00:39:52,690 --> 00:40:00,970
Scott: Right, so, but, the iPhone SE they just made is as good as, just smaller than, the iPhone 6S from six months ago.

834
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:13,709
Scott: So, is the iPhone SE 2 that's going to come out in March of 2017, and don't tell me that's just, you know, it's definitely coming, will it have everything the iPhone 7 has?

835
00:40:14,733 --> 00:40:16,970
Scott: Because the pattern would suggest that it will.

836
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:22,090
Rym: The only reason it wouldn't, in my mind, is if there was an engineering challenge and they need that space.

837
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:24,669
Scott: Right, so, here's the real deal breaker, right?

838
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:33,990
Scott: Will they have something so amazing in the iPhone 7, that it is worth getting the larger phone in order to get that feature that they're adding?

839
00:40:34,171 --> 00:40:37,270
Rym: I cannot imagine the feature, because...

840
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:40,310
Scott: I'm running out of stuff to imagine, I already have everything that I want.

841
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:47,186
Rym: A feature that would be that compelling, would be compelling enough for me to have an iPhone 8 SE, that's tiny, and an iPad.

842
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:54,830
Scott: And will that feature, let's say the iPhone 7 does have a feature that is very compelling that I want to upgrade to get.

843
00:40:56,912 --> 00:41:01,950
Scott: Will, in March 2017, will the next iPhone SE have that compelling feature?

844
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:07,730
Scott: Because if so, in September, this may be the first September where a contract runs out for me.

845
00:41:08,191 --> 00:41:16,230
Scott: And I do not get a new iPhone and wait six months more to get the SE instead and get on the different cycle.

846
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:17,609
Rym: Now this is the big test.

847
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:19,089
Scott: But, that's the thing, I might fuck up.

848
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:27,746
Scott: If the iPhone 7 has the thing I really want, and the SE 2 ends up not having it, and I end up just getting an iPhone 7 in March of 2017, now I'm in big trouble.

849
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:44,910
Rym: So Scott, I suspect, the only things I can come up with, that the larger phone, with its crazy whatever power and engineering challenges, might be able to provide that a small phone won't, in the next several years, are one, VR integration stuff that you clearly don't care about.

850
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:45,550
Scott: I don't need that nonsense.

851
00:41:46,191 --> 00:41:48,990
Rym: Or two, the kind of stuff you should be doing an iPad for.

852
00:41:49,332 --> 00:41:49,967
Scott: I have a giant iPad.

853
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:50,490
Scott: Yeah.

854
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:51,290
Scott: So that's another problem.

855
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:53,610
Scott: So my iPad mini broke, random nonsense.

856
00:41:54,093 --> 00:41:55,923
Rym: And you bought the gigantic cookie pan.

857
00:41:57,490 --> 00:42:00,530
Scott: The gigantic iPad Pro, which is great by the way.

858
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:02,090
Rym: It is great, but it is a baking dish.

859
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:04,070
Scott: It basically replaced all laptop usage.

860
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:14,190
Scott: However, if my iPad mini had not broken at that time, forcing me to get an iPad replacement before I wanted to, I would be getting the one they just announced today.

861
00:42:14,351 --> 00:42:15,729
Rym: The small iPad Pro.

862
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:18,290
Scott: Which seems to be like the best iPad there ever was.

863
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:20,250
Rym: I'm probably just going to buy it immediately.

864
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:21,209
Scott: You should, it'd be great.

865
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:22,550
Rym: Yeah, because the regular iPad Pro.

866
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:23,610
Scott: I'll trade you this big one for it.

867
00:42:23,792 --> 00:42:24,096
Scott: Is 12.9 inches.

868
00:42:25,511 --> 00:42:25,829
Scott: I'll trade you.

869
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:26,447
Scott: I'll trade you.

870
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,710
Rym: Your iPad Pro is bigger than my laptop.

871
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:30,689
Scott: Buy the small one, I'll trade you the big one for it.

872
00:42:31,656 --> 00:42:32,429
Rym: Uh, no.

873
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:33,470
Rym: Damn it.

874
00:42:34,072 --> 00:42:34,618
Rym: It's 9.7 inches.

875
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:42,330
Rym: It's not that much smaller, but that feels like the, like I took a piece of cardboard at work and cut it to that size and held it in my hand.

876
00:42:43,091 --> 00:42:44,108
Rym: Yeah, that's for me.

877
00:42:44,534 --> 00:42:45,029
Scott: It's a good one.

878
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:46,490
Rym: That is what I want.

879
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:52,330
Scott: I tell you, once, if you go all in on the iPad, you stop using your laptop unless you really, really, really need the keyboard for something.

880
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:53,290
Scott: Here's what I need my laptop for.

881
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:55,409
Scott: You can even get the keyboard if you really want to.

882
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:56,668
Scott: You don't need it.

883
00:42:56,931 --> 00:42:59,870
Rym: One, full versions of Adobe software, like Premiere.

884
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:04,910
Scott: You can use all the mobile versions, which I've never been, not been served well by the mobile versions.

885
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:08,070
Rym: Yeah, I would probably have a workflow that involves both the mobile and the full version.

886
00:43:08,232 --> 00:43:09,890
Rym: So I'd sometimes need my laptop, but not that often.

887
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:16,110
Scott: Dude, you can like get video at a con, start working on it in Premiere Clip on your iPad, and then it's on Creative Cloud.

888
00:43:16,191 --> 00:43:17,128
Scott: So when you get home, there it is.

889
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:17,503
Scott: Yeah.

890
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:21,070
Scott: And they just put out a new SD reader for lightning.

891
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:25,530
Scott: They put out a new lightning to SD adapter and a new lightning to USB adapter.

892
00:43:25,852 --> 00:43:28,344
Scott: So now we can much more easily load our contents.

893
00:43:28,485 --> 00:43:29,369
Scott: if I'm going to buy one of them.

894
00:43:29,532 --> 00:43:29,617
Scott: Yeah.

895
00:43:30,355 --> 00:43:31,530
Scott: Even though they're overpriced nonsense.

896
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:32,367
Scott: There is.

897
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:39,730
Scott: We can much more easily bulk load contents, videos and photos from our other camera devices into iPads on the road.

898
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:44,950
Rym: There is no way for me to do the audio workflows on an iPad.

899
00:43:45,595 --> 00:43:46,829
Rym: I need the full version of Audition.

900
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:48,150
Scott: There's no mobile Audition.

901
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:49,850
Rym: And I need FireWire input.

902
00:43:50,513 --> 00:43:51,350
Scott: There's none of that either.

903
00:43:51,721 --> 00:43:52,010
Rym: Yeah.

904
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:54,990
Rym: Not also, I would not trust that shit to work even if it existed.

905
00:43:56,151 --> 00:43:58,731
Rym: So there are playing Civ 5.

906
00:43:58,731 --> 00:44:00,810
Scott: You can play Civ 5, but you can play some other games.

907
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:01,448
Rym: So here's the thing.

908
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:10,190
Rym: When I travel overseas for a long trip, I would bring my laptop, not the iPad, because I play Rocket League and Civ and stuff in my hotel room like at night when I'm bored.

909
00:44:10,532 --> 00:44:11,749
Scott: You can play iOS games instead.

910
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:12,578
Rym: Eh.

911
00:44:13,452 --> 00:44:14,450
Scott: It's not Civ 5.

912
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:17,870
Scott: I started playing the Hearthstone again because we got a new expansion coming.

913
00:44:18,272 --> 00:44:22,930
Rym: If I'm away for like two weeks, I kind of want my real laptop to play Counter Strike and shit.

914
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:24,750
Rym: Because I can just play Counter Strike on my laptop.

915
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:25,249
Rym: It works great.

916
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:26,419
Scott: I guess I could.

917
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:27,930
Scott: I just don't even bother trying.

918
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:30,650
Rym: Because I have one better laptop than you and it's enough for Counter Strike.

919
00:44:30,932 --> 00:44:31,470
Scott: I don't even bother.

920
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:35,370
Rym: But for almost everything else, I'd use the iPad Pro.

921
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:39,890
Rym: Because the iPad Pro, the small one, has 100% of the features of the big one.

922
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:40,830
Rym: It's just smaller.

923
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:43,030
Scott: Let me also tell you, the pencil is overpriced.

924
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:44,450
Scott: 100 bucks for the pencil, right?

925
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:45,350
Scott: But it's kind of amazing.

926
00:44:45,612 --> 00:44:48,650
Scott: I tried some non-pencils and they didn't work.

927
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:51,130
Scott: Like the Adobe version, it was super cheap.

928
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:51,690
Scott: Discounted.

929
00:44:51,731 --> 00:44:52,182
Scott: Used to be 200 bucks.

930
00:44:52,611 --> 00:44:53,049
Scott: They discounted.

931
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:53,730
Scott: I bought one.

932
00:44:54,171 --> 00:44:54,968
Scott: It's not compatible.

933
00:44:55,751 --> 00:44:57,789
Scott: Adobe's like, "Fuck that thing with our logo on it.

934
00:44:57,910 --> 00:44:59,069
Scott: We'll just go in on Apple Pencil.

935
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,689
Scott: We're going to stop supporting the thing with our brand on

936
00:45:01,709 --> 00:45:01,750
Scott: it.".

937
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:01,953
Scott: I'm like,

938
00:45:02,015 --> 00:45:02,301
Scott: "Whoa.".

939
00:45:02,810 --> 00:45:05,409
Scott: So I caved after trying the pencil at the Apple Store again.

940
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:06,441
Scott: And I paid the 100 bucks.

941
00:45:07,476 --> 00:45:07,888
Scott: Fuck them.

942
00:45:07,888 --> 00:45:08,528
Scott: 100 bucks.

943
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:11,070
Scott: The pencil is so good.

944
00:45:12,674 --> 00:45:18,650
Scott: Even as a non-artist, it's basically... I'm having used a Cintiq and still not being an artist.

945
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:20,148
Scott: It's better than a Cintiq.

946
00:45:20,811 --> 00:45:22,970
Scott: It feels like you're on paper.

947
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:23,919
Scott: It's like, "Oh my

948
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:24,144
Scott: God.".

949
00:45:24,511 --> 00:45:26,550
Rym: Well, I actually would probably buy the pencil as well.

950
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:30,090
Rym: Because I actually draw a lot at work now.

951
00:45:30,832 --> 00:45:33,390
Rym: My UX game, I've been doing much more complex UX projects.

952
00:45:33,971 --> 00:45:37,510
Rym: And I've sort of been taking over for what other people would do.

953
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:39,970
Rym: And sort of going deeper into the stack on some big things.

954
00:45:40,535 --> 00:45:41,950
Scott: And I draw a lot now.

955
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:43,110
Scott: I've saved so much paper.

956
00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:44,390
Scott: Just all the doodling at work.

957
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:45,690
Scott: Not on real paper anymore.

958
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:46,669
Rym: Or when I write notes.

959
00:45:46,851 --> 00:45:47,810
Rym: I used to have a post-it note.

960
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:49,706
Rym: And I'd write, "Here's the four things I've got to do right

961
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:50,009
Rym: now.".

962
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:52,190
Scott: I've got to write down an IP address real quick.

963
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:54,705
Scott: And it's like, "Sure, I could just type that into

964
00:45:54,766 --> 00:45:55,189
Scott: Notepad.".

965
00:45:55,330 --> 00:45:59,470
Scott: But it actually is faster to take the pencil, write the IP address and notes.

966
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:00,710
Scott: Then go back to the computer.

967
00:46:01,812 --> 00:46:03,870
Rym: Also, you don't want to have four Notepads open.

968
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:05,330
Rym: Because they're in a hurry and a bunch of different things.

969
00:46:05,591 --> 00:46:06,864
Rym: Like, "Wait, that's a bad

970
00:46:06,905 --> 00:46:07,289
Rym: workflow.".

971
00:46:07,911 --> 00:46:11,982
Rym: But a lot of people make fun of the pen because they see it plugged into the side of the iPad charging.

972
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:16,890
Rym: Guys, that's not how you charge it normally.

973
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:19,490
Rym: That's what you do if you're running low on battery.

974
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:21,050
Scott: No, actually, that is how you charge it normally.

975
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:22,589
Rym: No, most people plug it into another thing.

976
00:46:23,052 --> 00:46:24,770
Scott: You have to plug it into a weird thing.

977
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:25,849
Rym: Which is what most people do.

978
00:46:26,011 --> 00:46:26,890
Scott: I've never done that.

979
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:27,744
Rym: The whole point of...

980
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:29,830
Scott: Also, it charges for so long.

981
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:31,889
Scott: I've only charged it once since I bought it.

982
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:32,790
Rym: Well, because that's the thing.

983
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:39,150
Rym: If it's low on battery, like dying, and you plug it into the side for like a minute, it gives you hours of time.

984
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:41,370
Scott: Yeah, you charge it by plugging it into the iPad.

985
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:43,250
Scott: You don't do the other cable thing.

986
00:46:43,452 --> 00:46:45,150
Rym: Yeah, most people I know do the cable thing.

987
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:46,150
Scott: I haven't seen anyone do the cable thing.

988
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:47,410
Rym: Of course, most of them also have a MacBook.

989
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:51,810
Scott: Another great feature is I have the Lightning to HDMI connector, right?

990
00:46:52,011 --> 00:46:53,889
Scott: Which is another ripoff $50 fucking thing.

991
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:58,030
Scott: But you can plug the iPad, any iPad, or even iPhone into a screen with that.

992
00:46:58,070 --> 00:47:06,890
Scott: Because HDMI, if you have the pencil on the iPad Pro, you can now do drawing on your lap, and everyone can see it on the screen, or the projector, or whatever it is.

993
00:47:07,091 --> 00:47:08,470
Scott: And you can demo this whiteboard.

994
00:47:08,633 --> 00:47:09,169
Scott: Oh, it's so good.

995
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:12,609
Rym: So, they announced Siri was expanded to more things like Apple TV.

996
00:47:13,070 --> 00:47:13,499
Scott: Who gives a shit?

997
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:13,949
Scott: No one gives.

998
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:18,569
Rym: I read a lot of articles talking about why people stop using Siri, and it's an interesting...

999
00:47:19,074 --> 00:47:20,609
Scott: I disabled Siri on everything I have.

1000
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:21,079
Rym: Yeah.

1001
00:47:23,494 --> 00:47:27,769
Scott: The thing is, there actually is a cute... This is the second time Cookie Monster has come up in this episode.

1002
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:37,950
Scott: There's a cute Apple commercial with Cookie Monster, where he's baking cookies, and he uses Siri to set a timer and listen to music, because he's got his hands dirty from baking.

1003
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:39,625
Scott: And I'm like, "Oh, that's a good

1004
00:47:39,686 --> 00:47:39,929
Scott: idea.".

1005
00:47:40,051 --> 00:47:41,229
Scott: But I'm still not going to enable Siri.

1006
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:43,970
Rym: So, the Care Kit, all their Research Kit health stuff...

1007
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:50,070
Scott: But there is a lot of times where I'm cooking something, or I touch sticky bread dough, and I don't want to touch my phone, and Siri would be good then.

1008
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:50,474
Scott: Nah.

1009
00:47:51,091 --> 00:47:51,870
Rym: You know what I did, Scott?

1010
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:54,169
Rym: Actually, because Amazon fucked up, I have two of them.

1011
00:47:54,611 --> 00:47:56,890
Rym: I have a USB keyboard that rolls up and is waterproof.

1012
00:47:57,375 --> 00:48:02,549
Scott: That doesn't work too... USB key... Oh, there is a new... I wonder if keyboards work with the new adapter they have.

1013
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:06,590
Rym: Yeah, because if they do, you want a just wireless garbage keyboard you use in the kitchen?

1014
00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:10,230
Scott: If I could get a Bluetooth keyboard that's kitchen proof, that would work really well.

1015
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:14,290
Rym: Yeah, I haven't seen those, because this is some low-rent, roll-up-able nonsense.

1016
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:16,570
Scott: I mean, yeah, I could sort of also just use the pencil, right?

1017
00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:19,610
Scott: Because I'm not touching the screen with my dirty hand, or just touching the pencil.

1018
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:24,010
Rym: So, people aren't that excited about it, but Care Kit, Apple's health tracking stuff, is super awesome.

1019
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:26,090
Scott: If you have a health problem, that's probably life-changing.

1020
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:28,790
Scott: Well, but... Like, they showed that person with epilepsy in the video?

1021
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:29,563
Scott: I'm like, "Wow, that is

1022
00:48:29,624 --> 00:48:29,848
Scott: great.".

1023
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:30,795
Rym: But...

1024
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:32,410
Scott: I'm lucky enough not to have a problem.

1025
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:35,390
Rym: I track all my exercise, and I actually use Google Fit and things.

1026
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:36,670
Scott: I track all my exercise.

1027
00:48:37,034 --> 00:48:37,119
Scott: Yeah.

1028
00:48:37,872 --> 00:48:38,448
Scott: I'm none of it.

1029
00:48:38,751 --> 00:48:42,590
Rym: I also track, like, if I have a pain, or if anything happens, I do keep track of it.

1030
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:43,210
Rym: So, I'll remember, like...

1031
00:48:43,272 --> 00:48:43,728
Scott: I don't do that.

1032
00:48:44,011 --> 00:48:48,363
Rym: It's useful, like when I went to the doctor with my jaw, to be able to say, "This is exactly when that started

1033
00:48:48,403 --> 00:48:48,708
Rym: hurting.".

1034
00:48:50,515 --> 00:48:58,465
Rym: But... All the cool stuff that Care Kit does really needs doctors and clinics to use this shit, Also, you're expecting...

1035
00:48:58,752 --> 00:49:06,029
Scott: They show... All the examples require a doctor to actually be paying that close attention, and caring about you, and spending that much time on you.

1036
00:49:06,390 --> 00:49:15,129
Scott: And even though it might take less time for the doctor to pay attention to you, because they can just look at their screen and see the data, and touch a few buttons, is the doctor really gonna fucking do that?

1037
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:17,550
Scott: Doctor can't even, like, use the computer they got, right?

1038
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:21,129
Rym: The renewable green stuff they talked about was actually some interesting...

1039
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:27,889
Scott: You're gonna be able to use this if you go to the doctor that, you know, Tim Cook goes to in San Francisco, and that's about it.

1040
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:32,674
Rym: Well, like I said with the dentist now, as I'm shopping for doctors, I'm gonna go check out a bunch of people.

1041
00:49:33,096 --> 00:49:37,509
Rym: every time I go to the doctor, and unless they have modern technology in the office, I'm never going back.

1042
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:40,330
Scott: Sure, but have you ever been to a doctor that's Apple anything?

1043
00:49:42,231 --> 00:49:44,750
Scott: I've gone to places with modern technology, but they don't have Apple shit.

1044
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:49,370
Rym: So, but the environmental stuff, so their little robot...

1045
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:50,228
Scott: We need to talk about that, too.

1046
00:49:50,551 --> 00:49:51,969
Rym: I think it's actually interesting, because...

1047
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:52,789
Scott: It's a cute video, that's about it.

1048
00:49:52,970 --> 00:50:08,149
Rym: Yeah, but that Liam robot, recycling iPhones, like actually recycling them to make other technology with, is actually kind of a big deal, because e-waste is a serious problem, and most tech companies are doing nothing about it.

1049
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:09,639
Scott: Best Buy's doing a lot, actually.

1050
00:50:09,659 --> 00:50:11,230
Scott: You can recycle all sorts of stuff at Best Buy.

1051
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:18,010
Rym: From what I can gather, a lot of that was because they were sort of forced to, or there's tax breaks, which I guess, if that guy does good things for bad reasons, still good.

1052
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:26,650
Scott: It's not a bad reason, but also, you know, it's like there's plenty of... I very rarely see people just like throwing cell phones in the garbage these days, right?

1053
00:50:26,971 --> 00:50:31,130
Scott: It seems like, you know, the vast majority of at least phones that no one wants anymore.

1054
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:37,810
Rym: Well, you say that, but where would you see what the average person does with their broken like iPhone 5 that they couldn't get repaired?

1055
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:39,229
Scott: Goes to eBay.

1056
00:50:39,631 --> 00:50:40,267
Rym: Yeah, does it?

1057
00:50:40,753 --> 00:50:41,307
Scott: I'm telling you.

1058
00:50:41,892 --> 00:50:43,669
Scott: There's not a lot of phones in the garbage these days.

1059
00:50:44,218 --> 00:50:44,727
Rym: I don't know.

1060
00:50:45,450 --> 00:50:52,350
Scott: Also, we're approaching the point where it's cheaper to get rare metals from old phones than it is to dig them out of the ground from crazy other countries.

1061
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:53,290
Rym: It's also way more ethical.

1062
00:50:53,770 --> 00:50:59,249
Scott: So even if you don't care about the environment, it's economically good to recycle at least these rare elements.

1063
00:51:01,053 --> 00:51:02,090
Rym: There was one other... Oh, yeah.

1064
00:51:02,210 --> 00:51:11,110
Rym: So I suspect that they weren't originally going to talk about this, but, you know, because of the encryption FBI stuff, they basically told the FBI to eat a bag of dicks.

1065
00:51:11,315 --> 00:51:11,568
Scott: Yep.

1066
00:51:12,092 --> 00:51:24,470
Rym: And they pretty much doubled down on saying that they're going to add increasingly awesome encryption features to iOS and make security a serious focus.

1067
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:27,409
Rym: That's actually really important news.

1068
00:51:28,431 --> 00:51:29,289
Scott: I mean, we knew that already.

1069
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:31,366
Rym: Yeah, but the fact that they're...

1070
00:51:31,810 --> 00:51:33,329
Scott: They just affirmed what we already knew.

1071
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:40,170
Rym: They're also... It's kind of important because early on in this, the majority of Americans were pro-FBI and anti-Apple.

1072
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:42,990
Rym: I think Apple is actually doing something very important here.

1073
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:45,389
Rym: They're advocating for the right thing.

1074
00:51:45,851 --> 00:51:48,710
Scott: Well, this is actually... So Apple's talked about this stuff like tons of times.

1075
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:55,569
Scott: This is the first time they talked about it at their Apple event, which I think is a big deal because that's like to the public and not just to the nerds.

1076
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:57,746
Rym: And they basically told the public, "We've got your

1077
00:51:57,786 --> 00:51:58,109
Rym: back.".

1078
00:51:58,592 --> 00:52:03,770
Rym: And the public is starting to come around and be on Apple's side as the FBI increasingly sounds shrill and dangerous.

1079
00:52:05,071 --> 00:52:08,210
Rym: So I think this is actually important that Apple is sticking to this.

1080
00:52:08,793 --> 00:52:13,789
Rym: And you might say that Apple is doing it out of their own self-interest because having a secure platform is good for their business.

1081
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:14,956
Rym: Yeah.

1082
00:52:16,412 --> 00:52:16,749
Rym: Exactly.

1083
00:52:17,696 --> 00:52:17,970
Rym: Awesome.

1084
00:52:19,391 --> 00:52:20,810
Rym: All right, I guess I got any more Apple news?

1085
00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:23,690
Scott: No, we had the one more news and it was the T-Mobile thing.

1086
00:52:25,332 --> 00:52:28,129
Scott: So T-Mobile has done this thing... We've talked about this before once, I think.

1087
00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:30,510
Rym: I don't think we actually... I think we mentioned it offhandedly.

1088
00:52:30,991 --> 00:52:32,390
Scott: Well, this is kind of important.

1089
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:33,406
Scott: This is a specific...

1090
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:41,410
Rym: You know, we talk about net neutrality and this is actually a very specific example where we can ignore analogies and talk about the literal reality of this thing.

1091
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:48,928
Rym: So T-Mobile has this thing called Binge On where you get your five or 10 or however many gigabytes you pay for of data.

1092
00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:59,890
Rym: But if you stream video from the services that they support with this thing and you don't opt out, it appears that it's... I think... I don't know if I'm opted into it or not.

1093
00:52:59,950 --> 00:53:00,750
Rym: I got to go check, actually.

1094
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:01,609
Scott: You can check on their website.

1095
00:53:01,936 --> 00:53:02,050
Scott: Yeah.

1096
00:53:02,410 --> 00:53:04,329
Rym: Because you can just turn this on or off in your settings.

1097
00:53:05,092 --> 00:53:17,829
Rym: But if you stream from one of the services they support, they will not count any of the bandwidth you use, but they'll throttle your videos down to 1.5 megabits per second, which ends up being a 480p video.

1098
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:35,930
Scott: So these services have basically integrated with T-Mobile and built against their API and configured their streaming servers to be like, "Oh, if the person visiting YouTube is binge on enabled, then send this video stream, and if not, just do what you normally

1099
00:53:36,802 --> 00:53:36,865
Scott: do.".

1100
00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:45,650
Rym: So basically, if I watch Netflix or YouTube or whatever at full p's, I'll actually burn through my five gigs pretty quick if I do that on a regular basis.

1101
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:50,670
Scott: I pretty much only ever use up all my data if I go to two conventions and watch YouTube videos on my phone.

1102
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:50,761
Rym: Yep.

1103
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:51,869
Rym: Two conventions in a month.

1104
00:53:52,010 --> 00:53:52,488
Rym: That'll do it.

1105
00:53:52,550 --> 00:53:54,690
Scott: And there's no Wi-Fi at the convention, which there usually isn't.

1106
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:55,750
Rym: I don't use it watching videos.

1107
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:58,210
Rym: I use it because I always tether my laptop and then other people's laptops.

1108
00:53:58,371 --> 00:54:04,248
Scott: I watch one YouTube video on the stupid, the bus, or my iPad tethered to my phone, and then that's it.

1109
00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:13,650
Rym: But actually, when I think about it, if I could just tell my phone, independently of T-Mobile or these ideas, "Hey, only show me videos at 480p because that'll way cut down.

1110
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:14,590
Scott: You can do that.

1111
00:54:14,811 --> 00:54:15,948
Rym: I can, but I don't think to.

1112
00:54:16,396 --> 00:54:16,504
Scott: No.

1113
00:54:17,656 --> 00:54:18,950
Scott: If it was easy- And you don't want to.

1114
00:54:19,331 --> 00:54:24,250
Scott: If I could put it in a- The worst is when things are subtitled, there's hard subtitles and not closed captioning YouTube.

1115
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:25,396
Rym: Yeah, because then 480p doesn't cut it.

1116
00:54:28,391 --> 00:54:32,930
Rym: So, I guess the question is, is this a net neutrality concern?

1117
00:54:35,352 --> 00:54:35,987
Scott: Yes and no.

1118
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:36,436
Scott: Yeah.

1119
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:37,167
Scott: Right?

1120
00:54:37,350 --> 00:54:42,030
Scott: So, it is because, basically, you're giving preferential treatment.

1121
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:43,689
Scott: You're not treating all traffic identically.

1122
00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:44,050
Scott: Right?

1123
00:54:44,110 --> 00:54:49,890
Rym: So, if Joey Jojo Shabadoo makes his Twitch competitor, and he doesn't implement all this?

1124
00:54:50,054 --> 00:54:50,188
Scott: Right.

1125
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:56,730
Scott: So, I make a Twitch competitor, and visiting my Twitch competitor is going to cost someone bandwidth.

1126
00:54:56,831 --> 00:54:58,187
Scott: But if they go to Twitch, it won't.

1127
00:54:58,570 --> 00:55:02,495
Scott: They're more likely to go to Twitch, and that's unfair competition because of something T-Mobile did.

1128
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:05,650
Scott: T-Mobile is favoring Twitch, which is not cool.

1129
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:16,070
Scott: Now, the only thing that makes this kind of okay, and the reason that Google actually agreed to integrate with it- Yeah, Google added YouTube to it recently, which is why we're talking about it.

1130
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:19,685
Scott: Is because they're not choosing who can do this.

1131
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:23,190
Scott: You can, if you're, say, a Twitch competitor.

1132
00:55:24,372 --> 00:55:25,250
Scott: Just add Binge on.

1133
00:55:25,573 --> 00:55:26,502
Scott: T-Mobile's not going to be like,

1134
00:55:26,542 --> 00:55:26,704
Scott: "No."

1135
00:55:27,493 --> 00:55:28,390
Scott: They'll just let you do it.

1136
00:55:28,670 --> 00:55:31,750
Rym: They also do not throttle other traffic.

1137
00:55:32,391 --> 00:55:35,766
Rym: It's not like, "We'll throttle everything unless they're on the

1138
00:55:35,847 --> 00:55:36,027
Rym: service.".

1139
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:42,096
Rym: What they're basically saying is, "We won't throttle anything, but you can opt in to throttling these few things if you want,".

1140
00:55:43,361 --> 00:55:46,208
Rym: and then if you do that, we'll give you a boon of not charging you.

1141
00:55:46,530 --> 00:55:50,447
Scott: You can almost say it's like, "Wow, what if T-Mobile was like IPv6

1142
00:55:50,608 --> 00:55:50,869
Scott: only?".

1143
00:55:51,351 --> 00:55:54,487
Scott: And it's like, "You can implement IPv6 if you want, or you

1144
00:55:54,587 --> 00:55:54,748
Scott: don't.".

1145
00:55:55,275 --> 00:55:55,809
Scott: It's your choice.

1146
00:55:56,390 --> 00:55:58,610
Scott: People with T-Mobile can see you, or they can't, right?

1147
00:55:59,172 --> 00:56:09,930
Rym: I guess the way I would put it, because I don't want to do the show too much longer because I'm kind of hungry, but I am okay with this, but this is basically the line.

1148
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:15,190
Scott: I really wish they would just say, because really, all these bandwidth limits are a scam.

1149
00:56:15,490 --> 00:56:19,850
Rym: Well, with cell stuff, it's a little more complicated because- It's still mostly a scam.

1150
00:56:20,673 --> 00:56:21,930
Scott: Everyone is way overcharging.

1151
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:26,170
Scott: There's definitely still price fixing, despite previous court cases about price fixing.

1152
00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:30,928
Scott: They're still doing it, and I would like to see some crackdowns get us some real pricing.

1153
00:56:31,470 --> 00:56:34,150
Scott: You look at the prices in Europe and other countries, and it's just bullshit.

1154
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:35,150
Rym: So, Sal, here's the question.

1155
00:56:35,810 --> 00:56:38,530
Rym: We could ... Well, not the question, but here's the supposition.

1156
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:51,569
Rym: We could probably, by relaxing certain neutrality regulations and coverage regulations, get unlimited, crazy bandwidth in the cities, and people who live outside of the cities would just be fucked.

1157
00:56:54,292 --> 00:56:58,490
Scott: But instead, we just say, "Hey, really rich companies like Verizon.

1158
00:56:59,231 --> 00:57:00,230
Scott: Unlimited bandwidth for everyone.

1159
00:57:00,471 --> 00:57:00,846
Scott: Deal with it.

1160
00:57:01,090 --> 00:57:01,528
Scott: Fuck you.

1161
00:57:02,471 --> 00:57:03,527
Scott: You must do what we say.

1162
00:57:05,512 --> 00:57:07,450
Scott: You'll be less profitable, but you'll still be profitable.

1163
00:57:07,610 --> 00:57:07,983
Scott: Deal with

1164
00:57:08,045 --> 00:57:08,086
Scott: it.".

1165
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:16,810
Rym: What if they wouldn't be profitable anymore because all their other revenue streams are drying up, and just being a utility company is not a super attractive business?

1166
00:57:17,951 --> 00:57:26,149
Rym: What if that would work, but Verizon would basically have to become like the electric company and would have to be subsidized with tax dollars to say, "Solve

1167
00:57:26,169 --> 00:57:26,269
Rym: it."

1168
00:57:26,473 --> 00:57:26,849
Rym: That's okay.

1169
00:57:27,601 --> 00:57:27,730
Rym: Yeah.

1170
00:57:28,376 --> 00:57:29,109
Rym: I'm not saying no.

1171
00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:29,763
Rym: I'm just saying, "What

1172
00:57:29,825 --> 00:57:29,907
Rym: if?".

1173
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:32,508
Scott: I mean, "What if Verizon became more like Con

1174
00:57:32,528 --> 00:57:32,770
Scott: Edison?".

1175
00:57:32,790 --> 00:57:34,366
Scott: I'm like, "Well, Con Edison's keeping the power

1176
00:57:34,427 --> 00:57:34,487
Scott: on.".

1177
00:57:34,934 --> 00:57:36,430
Scott: I think- My electricity's good quality.

1178
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:40,850
Scott: I think internet should be regulated- I've had way less power outs in New York City than anywhere else I've lived.

1179
00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:50,770
Rym: I think internet should be regulated and controlled like a utility, and it should be a government initiative- Just eminent domain, Verizon and Verizon Wireless, and let them keep the rest of the business.

1180
00:57:50,770 --> 00:57:59,509
Rym: I think the US government has a vested interest in spending taxpayer dollars to ensure very high bandwidth connectivity to the majority of citizens in the country, the majority of people in the country.

1181
00:57:59,955 --> 00:58:00,409
Scott: Every person.

1182
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:01,003
Rym: Yeah.

1183
00:58:01,351 --> 00:58:08,308
Scott: Because I think that would be a net boon- If you're a citizen and you own a property and you want internet to come to that property, it should happen no matter what.

1184
00:58:09,833 --> 00:58:11,889
Rym: But in terms of net neutrality with this service-

1185
00:58:12,251 --> 00:58:24,149
Scott: If I bought a house literally in the middle of the woods, I find the spot in the US that's farthest away from any other house, and I built a house and I wanted electricity to come to that house, it would come to that house.

1186
00:58:24,812 --> 00:58:28,150
Scott: I almost disagree because actually- And so would a telephone line.

1187
00:58:28,490 --> 00:58:45,050
Rym: Yeah, and I feel like maybe by providing that assurance, we have enabled people to spread into territory that is not feasible for humans to live in, and that suburban sprawl was partly caused by a subsidization of rural and suburban infrastructure.

1188
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:45,490
Scott: I agree.

1189
00:58:46,331 --> 00:58:53,810
Scott: If there was a law that said if I had a house, then internet has to come to it, I sure as hell would get a second house real cheap in the middle of nowhere and have the internet go to it.

1190
00:58:53,850 --> 00:59:02,570
Rym: We would have a waterfall house somewhere in bumfuck New York, and we'd hang out there on weekends, and if our friends founded a game studio, we'd tell them to go live in the house.

1191
00:59:03,332 --> 00:59:04,470
Scott: I would definitely have such a place.

1192
00:59:04,631 --> 00:59:06,590
Rym: Oh my God, I would have a place faster than you could blink.

1193
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:09,150
Scott: So yes, I agree that that probably happened.

1194
00:59:09,331 --> 00:59:09,417
Scott: Yeah.

1195
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:13,210
Scott: But yeah, I feel like- And I agree that I'm hungry.

1196
00:59:13,310 --> 00:59:13,949
Scott: Can we end it now?

1197
00:59:14,330 --> 00:59:17,070
Rym: I am okay with the T-Mobile thing, but I think that's the line.

1198
00:59:17,231 --> 00:59:19,010
Scott: I'm only sort of okay with it.

1199
00:59:19,071 --> 00:59:21,270
Rym: Well, I'm okay with it if it's the line.

1200
00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:22,352
Rym: Kind of like.

1201
00:59:22,713 --> 00:59:27,748
Rym: I was mostly okay with copyright pre Sonny Bono if that had been the line.

1202
00:59:29,390 --> 00:59:31,290
Rym: I said kind of okay and the line.

1203
00:59:31,671 --> 00:59:33,610
Rym: Neither of those things ended up being okay.

1204
00:59:33,690 --> 00:59:43,010
Scott: I'm not going to get mad and riot like some other situations, but- If T-Mobile pushed this a little bit further, I would be Pitchforks.

1205
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:51,120
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1206
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:56,240
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando Kay for the logos.

1207
00:59:56,620 --> 01:00:01,660
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1208
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:04,580
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1209
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:09,340
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1211
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:17,100
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1212
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:20,300
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1213
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:48,469
Rym: GeekNights has a Patreon and all of the people who are giving us at least five dollars are listed now in every episode in the order of the amount of money they are giving us on a continuing basis.

01:00:49,850 --> 01:01:25,790
Rym: Rebecca Dunn, Nicholas Brandow, Heidi McNichol, Amanda Duchette, James David White, Christian Koontz, JessMyStady.com, Mechanical Mind, William Eisenroz, Jeremy Minor, you expect the nickname to be yours but it was me, Dio, Scott John Harrison, Sean Yeager, Clinton Walton, Wren from New Zealand, Robert Lee, Ryan Perrin, Drew Openlander, Rare Lavelle, Brian Sidroni, Rochelle Montanona, Finn Eric Silver on Canvel, Steel Beamed, Kinetic Man, Aaron Cerise, Chris Midkiff, Chris Knox, The Magical Black Guy, Sam Cordery, Daniel Redman, Chris Haddad, Sean Klein, Chris Reimer, and Thomas Hahn.

1215
01:01:26,431 --> 01:01:47,150
Rym: We are real close to hitting that goal, so actually I realized the goals got set upward because Patreon a while ago changed the way it counts pledges and removes transaction fees and all this nonsense, but basically we were actually literally three dollars away from hitting the goal where I'm going to release all the beta pre-publication episodes of GeekNights with commentary, remastered, all that nonsense.

1216
01:01:47,610 --> 01:01:49,849
Rym: So we're real close to it regardless.

1217
01:01:50,399 --> 01:01:50,950
Rym: Stay tuned.

1218
01:01:51,750 --> 01:02:00,390
Rym: Beyond that, like I said, we're going to be at Anime Boston, we're going to be at the Zank icon, some stuff's going on, and as I post it in the forum, I'm going to do something fun on Patreon, but sadly you guys won't see it for a while.

1219
01:02:01,370 --> 01:02:20,151
Rym: Once our all-human, front row crew, long-term, play-by-mail Civ 5 game gets far enough along to where none of the intelligence that I will be sharing can harm me, I am going to basically give you guys a long video of my updates in this game, turn-by-turn, or at least all the turns.

1220
01:02:20,171 --> 01:02:30,770
Rym: if something interesting happens, starting with a tour of Portugal, my glorious, entirely peaceful nation, though I'm sure the retrospective will find out that I was anything but peaceful.

1221
01:02:31,875 --> 01:02:32,690
Rym: We'll see how that goes.

1222
01:02:32,830 --> 01:02:44,070
Rym: I don't think anyone in the game is listening to this, except one person with whom I have a tentative alliance, and I expect that someone else will probably declare war on them long before I do, but that is neither here nor there.

1223
01:02:44,331 --> 01:02:51,750
Rym: The important thing is that I always try to do these last bits and Rym's, rants, and everything as one long take, no retakes, no cuts, no nothing.

1224
01:02:52,210 --> 01:02:57,770
Rym: I won't even pause this recording, I'm trying to force myself to be able to do patter constantly without stop, even when I don't have Scott there.

1225
01:02:58,070 --> 01:03:13,990
Rym: You're going to see a good example of that at Zenkai Con, because Scott finally confirmed to me that he is bailing on Zenkai Con, which I kind of anticipated, because every year I always submit panels that I could do entirely on my own, and once again I will do them entirely on my own, except for one that I'll do with our other Scott, Scott Johnson.

1226
01:03:14,510 --> 01:03:21,309
Rym: But anyway, that is all I'm going to say on this one, because I am running out of stuff to say right now, sort of just droning on and on.

1227
01:03:22,171 --> 01:03:32,586
Rym: And now I present to you something odd, though I do want to point out, a while ago people used to say in the forum like, "Oh, I know what that is, I know what that, like they recognize the weird thing I put in the end of the

1228
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:32,788
Rym: show.".

1229
01:03:33,452 --> 01:03:47,250
Rym: And people stopped doing it for a while, and pulling around, it appears that I have finally gone beyond the pale, and literally no one knows what some of those things I have posted in these stingers was actually from.

1230
01:03:47,891 --> 01:04:00,030
Rym: So I'm going to dial it back a little bit, and you might recognize somewhere over the next few weeks, but I will return in the far and distant future to the most obscure nonsense that you have ever heard at the end of the show.
