1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,830
Rym: It's Tuesday September 13th 2016.

2
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:20,875
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight captain sonar One ping only.

3
00:00:22,861 --> 00:00:24,749
Scott: I use two things that you can do about it.

4
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:29,193
Scott: I said one thing we think like three times And then we found you and blow you.

5
00:00:29,315 --> 00:00:29,860
Rym: Oh, what was it?

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,160
Rym: There was this game that I used to play on the Intellivision where you were a sub captain.

7
00:00:34,261 --> 00:00:38,368
Rym: I'm trying to look it up when we get to the main bit of the show But I played this game on the Intellivision.

8
00:00:38,388 --> 00:00:47,864
Rym: you're like a sub captain and you've got a harbor you've got to defend and enemy submarines are coming in to nuke it and you're like sneaking around and finding them and pinging them and Then torpedoing them.

9
00:00:47,904 --> 00:00:53,565
Rym: and I remember as a dumb kid not really understanding that game and playing it a lot But not quite getting it.

10
00:00:54,228 --> 00:00:54,469
Rym: All right.

11
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:58,063
Rym: I should emulate it and see what the deal was if that game was actually good or not Good for you.

12
00:00:58,083 --> 00:00:59,568
Rym: Yeah, it was a good submarine game.

13
00:00:59,588 --> 00:01:00,391
Rym: There's a lot of good submarine game.

14
00:01:00,451 --> 00:01:08,276
Rym: Actually, you know, what's pretty good is the Game the original Game Boy Red October game because it was a two-player.

15
00:01:08,317 --> 00:01:15,757
Rym: last time you played it Uh, it was unique in that it was a two-player Real-time asymmetric game that used the link cable.

16
00:01:15,999 --> 00:01:17,143
Rym: Mm-hmm The original link cable.

17
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:22,360
Rym: one of you was the Red October and the other one of you was the entire Russian Navy.

18
00:01:23,002 --> 00:01:33,679
Rym: And you'd like put assets around and go after the sub and it was it was I'm not saying was necessarily a good game by Like objective standard but for the time there was nothing else like that.

19
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:36,331
Scott: All right, try to play it and see how much if it's like what you remember.

20
00:01:36,351 --> 00:01:38,260
Rym: I mean, it's a real simple game.

21
00:01:38,321 --> 00:01:39,180
Rym: I remember it real well.

22
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:45,102
Rym: In fact, I played it a few years ago in an emulator to see what the deal was because as a kid while I was obsessed With it.

23
00:01:45,684 --> 00:01:49,679
Rym: I only knew one person who had a Game Boy and a link cable and was willing to play it with me.

24
00:01:50,621 --> 00:01:54,635
Scott: Do the emulator support opening up to emulators and having a virtual link cable between them?

25
00:01:55,437 --> 00:01:56,200
Rym: Uh, I don't know.

26
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:56,883
Rym: I just played it.

27
00:01:56,963 --> 00:02:01,605
Scott: like you can play it single-player or like using the internet using the network as a Link cable.

28
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:06,224
Rym: so I don't know a lot about the state of non NES SNES Mame emulators.

29
00:02:07,147 --> 00:02:07,829
Rym: I should look into that.

30
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:17,160
Rym: I did find a game boy a 3ds emulator that worked Okay, and I used that to do some advanced war streams, but holy shit doesn't need a lot of CPU.

31
00:02:17,683 --> 00:02:23,692
Scott: I think what people mostly do to stream 3ds stuff is they send their 3ds to this guy who installs a video out?

32
00:02:23,732 --> 00:02:26,200
Scott: Yeah, I've seen that and apparently it's a reliable.

33
00:02:26,381 --> 00:02:27,607
Scott: But there's like a wait period.

34
00:02:27,627 --> 00:02:30,380
Scott: so generally you get a buy 3ds send it and then just wait.

35
00:02:30,501 --> 00:02:31,064
Rym: I've seen kits.

36
00:02:31,104 --> 00:02:34,180
Rym: you can do it yourself, but I'm not a good solder anymore.

37
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:36,212
Scott: I mean, I happen I am but are you?

38
00:02:36,252 --> 00:02:37,278
Rym: what was the last thing you soldered?

39
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,325
Scott: The clock nice to my bed.

40
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:40,511
Rym: All right, how long ago was that 2006?

41
00:02:40,511 --> 00:02:40,893
Rym: I don't know.

42
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,066
Scott: I mean in my apartment.

43
00:02:44,086 --> 00:02:45,050
Scott: I was living in New York.

44
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,398
Scott: Yeah, I have all kinds of soldering shit.

45
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:48,000
Scott: I can sign.

46
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,965
Rym: So I was in Utah.

47
00:02:49,985 --> 00:02:52,051
Rym: That's why GeekNights was delayed even longer.

48
00:02:52,754 --> 00:02:53,637
Scott: Why would you go there?

49
00:02:54,058 --> 00:02:54,620
Rym: It was a work thing.

50
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,833
Rym: I'd go for this hackathon or whatever and a hackathon in Utah.

51
00:02:57,873 --> 00:02:59,680
Scott: the people there like our computers.

52
00:03:00,343 --> 00:03:03,600
Rym: No, well, actually there's a huge tech it business like industry there.

53
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,205
Rym: like if you want to if you want to live somewhere cheap and Get a tech job.

54
00:03:07,225 --> 00:03:08,392
Scott: There's a reason it's cheap.

55
00:03:08,915 --> 00:03:09,860
Scott: There's a reason it's cheap.

56
00:03:10,322 --> 00:03:19,885
Rym: You get what you pay if you're not gonna live in a tier one city like New York or Chicago or whatever Salt Lake City like that level of city not the worst place like living in Omaha, Nebraska Like.

57
00:03:20,088 --> 00:03:20,859
Rym: you'll get a job.

58
00:03:21,821 --> 00:03:22,647
Rym: You'll get a job.

59
00:03:23,029 --> 00:03:26,321
Rym: There's more than two restaurants Three.

60
00:03:26,986 --> 00:03:28,900
Rym: a lot of people don't live in New York, and that's fine.

61
00:03:29,221 --> 00:03:33,661
Rym: But also the deal is this is a super here in Park City, which is like for 23.

62
00:03:33,661 --> 00:03:41,340
Rym: It's like 40 miles east way up in the mountains like so high that when I went mountain biking I had some trouble with the altitude.

63
00:03:42,001 --> 00:03:42,404
Scott: Okay.

64
00:03:42,585 --> 00:03:49,022
Rym: Yeah, but I did go for real mountain biking Which I haven't done that often recently and this was the most intense I've done yet because you know I didn't.

65
00:03:49,062 --> 00:04:02,119
Rym: Sydney every time I go in the Blue Mountains and I do it in Singapore every time I go and Singapore is like a technical track and Sydney is just like down a mountain on a fire trail and then like one single track technical Course at the end after the 40 kilometers or whatever.

66
00:04:02,762 --> 00:04:19,442
Rym: But this was go up a couple thousand feet and then ride on crazy steep like super technical courses all the way down the mountain all over the place I Strava did or whatever and I'm pretty proud how I did like I only flipped over my handlebars once Mm-hmm.

67
00:04:20,147 --> 00:04:20,668
Rym: It was good.

68
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:24,668
Rym: I got a pretty serious bruise on my thigh though It hurts real bad if it does.

69
00:04:24,949 --> 00:04:37,507
Rym: if it keeps growing I might go to a doctor and get it checked out but otherwise do dangerous shit, but it was fun and I'm proud to say that my belief in my skills as a mountain biker Were fine.

70
00:04:37,648 --> 00:04:40,599
Rym: I chose to go with the pro group So I followed the two guys.

71
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:46,700
Scott: Your belief in your skills regarding everything are inflated, but that's who you are.

72
00:04:46,821 --> 00:04:47,243
Rym: I never.

73
00:04:47,383 --> 00:04:53,650
Rym: I followed the pro guys down the technical black diamond trail and I had a pretty good time compared.

74
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,720
Rym: I was only like two minutes behind them.

75
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:00,060
Scott: Are you sure they were actually pro guys or were they guys who just had fancy equipment and looked like pro guys?

76
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:00,904
Rym: No, they knew their stuff.

77
00:05:00,924 --> 00:05:01,145
Rym: They were.

78
00:05:01,165 --> 00:05:01,346
Rym: they were.

79
00:05:01,387 --> 00:05:02,754
Rym: one of them was like our guide and everything.

80
00:05:02,956 --> 00:05:05,980
Rym: Yeah, okay Yeah, the bike I had though was great.

81
00:05:06,161 --> 00:05:14,110
Rym: It was this like all carbon fiber mountain bike and had this crazy Gearing made for mountain biking my lowest gear.

82
00:05:14,431 --> 00:05:18,726
Rym: The front gear was way smaller than the rear gear and had all Hydraulic brakes and everything.

83
00:05:18,746 --> 00:05:22,100
Scott: I don't like the hydraulic disc brakes, but I guess we're at a mountain.

84
00:05:22,141 --> 00:05:22,778
Scott: You don't have a choice.

85
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:28,222
Rym: Yeah, because the thing is you can't have Rym brakes on a mountain bike cuz I get some mud in there and you did Yep.

86
00:05:28,604 --> 00:05:32,600
Rym: Also, you got to be able to coast on them a lot because some of the slopes are so steep.

87
00:05:33,022 --> 00:05:35,031
Rym: You're going down in a grade that's almost straight down.

88
00:05:35,072 --> 00:05:43,800
Rym: You've got to ride the brake And the suspension was way way beyond anything I'd ever used in a mountain bike for real before.

89
00:05:45,484 --> 00:05:45,788
Rym: Which man?

90
00:05:45,829 --> 00:05:49,639
Rym: if I didn't lock it out It was like doo doo doo doo when I actually tried to pedal anywhere.

91
00:05:50,182 --> 00:05:56,551
Rym: But going down the mountain I could slam into like a four-foot high tree stump wouldn't even feel it Just like put him right over it.

92
00:05:56,571 --> 00:05:57,176
Rym: Mm-hmm.

93
00:05:57,296 --> 00:05:57,760
Rym: It's good times.

94
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:01,468
Rym: Yeah, that was that was my open event.

95
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:02,292
Rym: you got any news.

96
00:06:02,392 --> 00:06:07,490
Rym: we got anything to talk about other than the Really disappointing omega-thon finale.

97
00:06:08,153 --> 00:06:10,964
Scott: We could talk about the disappointing omega-thon Not a repeat.

98
00:06:11,386 --> 00:06:14,740
Rym: for the second time in a row the omega-thon finale was on Mario game.

99
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:19,640
Scott: Yeah for the PAX Prime omega-thon for the second time in a row was Mario last year.

100
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,900
Scott: It was Mario maker with a pretty easy level that used the Super Mario World bits.

101
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,207
Rym: And yet was clearly the fight the omega-thon finale.

102
00:06:26,227 --> 00:06:32,400
Rym: people last year were both people who appeared to have never played a Mario game before Yet somehow made it to your mega-thon finale.

103
00:06:32,581 --> 00:06:38,041
Rym: Well the curve well because the omega-thon up until the last round is mostly kind of easy in this year It wasn't.

104
00:06:38,101 --> 00:06:40,184
Scott: it was actually games of somewhat skill.

105
00:06:40,344 --> 00:06:42,127
Rym: Sure was like super skill a lot of tabletop.

106
00:06:42,147 --> 00:06:43,569
Scott: There weren't random games really.

107
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:49,860
Scott: and then So this year it was just Mario 3. play for 10 minutes over as the higher score and you have infinite lives.

108
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,109
Scott: We put game genies just in case you suck now.

109
00:06:52,149 --> 00:06:53,033
Scott: This is notable.

110
00:06:53,234 --> 00:06:54,218
Scott: that was necessary.

111
00:06:54,278 --> 00:06:55,325
Scott: cuz boy Did they suck?

112
00:06:55,405 --> 00:06:57,179
Rym: it would have been game over immediately for both of them?

113
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,364
Rym: Yeah, but it was notable for two reasons.

114
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:09,095
Rym: one the the new challenger had clearly never played Mario 3 before and probably never Played a Mario game before because the way they were like they didn't seem to realize they didn't.

115
00:07:09,135 --> 00:07:10,280
Scott: they didn't hold D to run.

116
00:07:10,922 --> 00:07:15,138
Scott: But the other guy on the right he was the guy who was in there last year and lost.

117
00:07:15,981 --> 00:07:17,527
Rym: I would never played Mario last year.

118
00:07:17,547 --> 00:07:19,254
Scott: He clearly yeah, and he's still.

119
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:20,820
Scott: he didn't appear to improve at all.

120
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,220
Rym: He got to the omega-thon again.

121
00:07:22,601 --> 00:07:27,078
Rym: It was a Mario game again, and he still didn't hold B to run in the entire like.

122
00:07:27,098 --> 00:07:33,348
Rym: sorry, dude Sorry to trash a semi-anonymous stranger on the internet on our show But you don't deserve to be a lot.

123
00:07:33,368 --> 00:07:35,940
Scott: you shouldn't be allowed into packs with those kind of Mario skills.

124
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:36,984
Rym: See now it's.

125
00:07:37,004 --> 00:07:42,353
Rym: we're getting to the point where those Mario games are so old that I'm not gonna say I'm not gonna try to Be some sort of gatekeeper for packs like.

126
00:07:42,393 --> 00:07:43,300
Rym: that's actually kind of stupid.

127
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,245
Scott: I'm a gatekeeper for.

128
00:07:44,305 --> 00:07:47,039
Scott: I mean you shouldn't even be allowed to like play other games.

129
00:07:47,422 --> 00:07:49,596
Rym: What so 20 years from now kids have to play Mario 1 yeah?

130
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:50,905
Scott: It's like you know.

131
00:07:50,925 --> 00:07:52,700
Scott: you can't drive until you get a driver's license.

132
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,890
Scott: You can't play games until you can play a Mario.

133
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,080
Rym: the only I mean in all seriousness the only reason.

134
00:07:57,622 --> 00:08:03,771
Rym: I would say anyone really has to play those games as if they're Serious about gaming as a hobby or game design.

135
00:08:04,093 --> 00:08:07,286
Scott: so you're someone is in coming to packs And they're not serious about gaming.

136
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:10,077
Rym: most people who go to most conventions aren't serious about the thing they go for.

137
00:08:10,278 --> 00:08:10,800
Rym: that's always been.

138
00:08:11,021 --> 00:08:17,120
Scott: You shouldn't be coming because it's someone else who is serious who wants to come and can't come because you're there so get out all right.

139
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,273
Rym: You're exactly the stereotype of what's wrong with most fandom community.

140
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,579
Rym: serious only except That's not what packs is even about.

141
00:08:23,941 --> 00:08:26,472
Rym: Packses you know get people to see all the different sides of gaming.

142
00:08:26,512 --> 00:08:30,069
Rym: maybe they come just for the expo hall But then they see a tabletop game.

143
00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:30,792
Rym: they get interested.

144
00:08:30,813 --> 00:08:32,140
Scott: Yeah, maybe you should play Mario.

145
00:08:35,323 --> 00:08:36,027
Rym: Disgrace it was.

146
00:08:36,068 --> 00:08:38,299
Rym: it was just very interesting because I noticed something.

147
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:54,190
Rym: This is totally an aside, but I met just because I was traveling a lot around packs and after packs in Seattle I met a ton of people who are kind of serious gamers like they play games a lot like obscure German tabletop games like obsessed with Overwatch like PC gamers like these people aren't.

148
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:58,054
Rym: gamers like these are the people where you would even say yeah They should go to packs mm-hmm.

149
00:08:59,022 --> 00:09:04,860
Rym: I get the impression that the vast majority of those people in the US have never heard of packs or penny arcade mm-hmm.

150
00:09:05,181 --> 00:09:09,455
Rym: I think the vast majority of gamers have never heard of the idea of a gaming convention.

151
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:10,257
Scott: Yeah, why would they?

152
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,120
Rym: well?

153
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:11,903
Rym: Do you think it's not.

154
00:09:12,024 --> 00:09:14,640
Scott: it's not advertised to the general public it's in the internet.

155
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,800
Scott: And if you don't live in the internet like I do or we do then you don't know what's going on.

156
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,242
Scott: There's a whole.

157
00:09:19,262 --> 00:09:20,650
Scott: it's basically another world all these.

158
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:23,166
Rym: but these are people who read read it regularly They're on the internet.

159
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:24,235
Rym: They like use Twitter all the time.

160
00:09:24,275 --> 00:09:25,845
Rym: They do all the stuff We do like everything.

161
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:27,132
Rym: they read Kotaku.

162
00:09:27,454 --> 00:09:28,882
Rym: they read all the shit We read.

163
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:32,860
Scott: they just don't know packs exists, but this Kotaku has like a big section every time.

164
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,247
Scott: They just don't notice like.

165
00:09:34,267 --> 00:09:35,392
Rym: they don't like gaming convention.

166
00:09:35,412 --> 00:09:35,875
Rym: What do you mean?

167
00:09:35,895 --> 00:09:36,799
Scott: They just don't read it?

168
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,667
Scott: I guess they just don't get those articles that are Covering the whole front of the.

169
00:09:40,707 --> 00:09:46,315
Rym: these are people who are like oh, yeah Like I'm ready that really the German games and the Catan is too easy, but Puerto Rico is pretty good.

170
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,560
Rym: or like yeah I've been playing overwatch a lot.

171
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,828
Rym: It finally gave me that like old quake to feel.

172
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:54,160
Rym: and yet they don't know gaming conventions exist.

173
00:09:54,501 --> 00:09:56,227
Scott: They didn't and then must not be reading.

174
00:09:56,287 --> 00:09:58,073
Scott: I mean basically if something happens on the internet.

175
00:09:58,555 --> 00:10:00,000
Scott: It's in like its own dimension.

176
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,265
Scott: It doesn't like advertise.

177
00:10:01,607 --> 00:10:02,430
Scott: you have to know.

178
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:04,900
Scott: if you have to go into that you have to know the zone exists.

179
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,060
Scott: You have to find the door on your own and walk into it of your own volition.

180
00:10:08,681 --> 00:10:10,670
Scott: It's not the door doesn't have like a sign on it.

181
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:13,928
Scott: There's no one outside the door saying come inside guys You know, this thing is here.

182
00:10:13,968 --> 00:10:14,210
Scott: Whoo.

183
00:10:14,452 --> 00:10:15,158
Scott: This thing is here.

184
00:10:15,218 --> 00:10:25,639
Scott: Whoo It's like you have to know it's a stumble upon it or search or know someone or be told or something Right in order to find places on the internet and know things exist.

185
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:43,323
Rym: Yeah, though the one ray of hope one person I met in all my travels had heard of not only packs but penny arcade and knew who gave in taiko were Because her child is really interested in game design and watches video of the panels from paxes Cuz.

186
00:10:43,383 --> 00:10:45,055
Rym: the child doesn't go to paxes.

187
00:10:45,075 --> 00:10:45,559
Rym: Mmm.

188
00:10:45,882 --> 00:10:47,679
Rym: So there is one ray of hope there.

189
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:53,580
Rym: But that aside people don't know about packs and they definitely don't know how to play Mario games.

190
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:58,480
Rym: So to the credit of the guy on the left at pack, he seemed to learn how to play Mario slowly.

191
00:10:58,521 --> 00:10:59,159
Rym: I mean it is fun.

192
00:10:59,361 --> 00:11:03,400
Scott: Mario 3 is one of the best games of all time and it teaches you how to play it.

193
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,044
Rym: So it's fine.

194
00:11:04,084 --> 00:11:06,860
Rym: If you get to the America if you go to packs and you haven't played Mario, it's fine.

195
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,219
Rym: I mean what if you're only a tabletop gamer and why you can just go to Gen Con?

196
00:11:11,601 --> 00:11:13,026
Rym: Even if you're only a tabletop game.

197
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,551
Rym: also don't go to jail.

198
00:11:14,571 --> 00:11:16,317
Scott: if you're a tabletop gamer you still.

199
00:11:16,378 --> 00:11:17,060
Scott: I mean Mario.

200
00:11:17,201 --> 00:11:20,720
Scott: It's like it's like if you're only a video gamer and you haven't played settlers.

201
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:24,943
Rym: So I've been watching a lot of Industry.

202
00:11:24,964 --> 00:11:25,947
Rym: people talk about anime.

203
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:33,331
Rym: we're at a point now where there is literally no show That you could even say a third of American anime fans are familiar with deeply.

204
00:11:33,531 --> 00:11:36,420
Rym: Yeah, there's no touchstone show nothing, right?

205
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:42,800
Rym: And the one complete bifurcation not even a bifurcation just a long tail spread across all genres.

206
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,720
Scott: It's the same thing with right and the and the two thirds who haven't seen cowboy bebop and evangelical.

207
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,899
Scott: You know the ones who are wrong and aren't real fans.

208
00:11:51,103 --> 00:11:56,180
Scott: They can just go You know not be allowed at the anime convention anyway.

209
00:11:56,381 --> 00:11:58,533
Rym: Well, I mean most people go to anime cons haven't seen anime.

210
00:11:58,553 --> 00:12:07,480
Rym: at least most people go to packs Actually, I would say that but I get the impression this year a lot of people who went to packs only went to see PewDiePie Maybe but I don't have any data on that yet.

211
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,860
Rym: I'm actually trying to figure out why packs felt so light even though it was clearly sold out.

212
00:12:12,121 --> 00:12:14,495
Rym: It was clearly the biggest packs ever and it was quiet.

213
00:12:14,636 --> 00:12:21,277
Rym: Yeah, like it was Weirdly quiet like tabletop felt like packs circa 2008 or not.

214
00:12:21,297 --> 00:12:25,330
Rym: You could get seats Yeah, like trivially middle of the day on Saturday.

215
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:29,002
Rym: Just go to the convention center pick any tabletop room get a whole table Mm-hmm.

216
00:12:29,202 --> 00:12:29,845
Rym: It was weird.

217
00:12:30,266 --> 00:12:31,692
Rym: Anyway, so you got any news?

218
00:12:32,274 --> 00:12:38,319
Scott: Yeah, so speaking of Mario's You know Apple dead Apple Day since we last did a show.

219
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:42,697
Scott: Yeah, it was a pretty boring Apple Day because they didn't really add anything to the iPhone.

220
00:12:42,717 --> 00:12:43,480
Rym: They took shit away.

221
00:12:43,941 --> 00:12:44,743
Scott: What did they take away?

222
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:45,605
Rym: headphone jack?

223
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:47,430
Scott: All right, yeah, whatever.

224
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:53,488
Scott: but I think the I think the fear over the loss of the Headphone jack is greatly exaggerated.

225
00:12:53,569 --> 00:12:56,020
Scott: Not that it's you know, not that I don't want a headphone jack.

226
00:12:56,272 --> 00:13:04,186
Rym: well a lot of people have pointed out that all the devices that use that hole to plug in like temperature sensors and Scientific equipment and mostly payment processors.

227
00:13:04,206 --> 00:13:04,487
Rym: Mm-hmm.

228
00:13:04,948 --> 00:13:08,276
Rym: It appears that they will not work with the dongles.

229
00:13:09,319 --> 00:13:11,199
Scott: I Don't know about that.

230
00:13:11,361 --> 00:13:14,580
Rym: I mean that that is the report that I read this morning when I was looking into it.

231
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:17,514
Rym: I've not followed up too much because that's my topic for Monday.

232
00:13:17,534 --> 00:13:18,820
Scott: That's a good question.

233
00:13:19,782 --> 00:13:23,480
Scott: I mean as far as I believe is basically on the lightning connector.

234
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,973
Scott: It like it just converts all the analog to digital and vice versa.

235
00:13:28,454 --> 00:13:30,380
Scott: So what like your square reader?

236
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,244
Scott: Why wouldn't it work?

237
00:13:31,425 --> 00:13:31,787
Scott: It would just.

238
00:13:31,968 --> 00:13:34,000
Scott: you know, you're reading from the analog input.

239
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,708
Rym: This is the were so the the.

240
00:13:35,768 --> 00:13:43,062
Scott: I'd have to look I'd have to look at the documentation for like the API For the analog and input/output on the phone But I did.

241
00:13:43,142 --> 00:14:01,200
Rym: I read an article that was basically by this dude who were like blogs apparently on payment processing Specifically and he was talking about how the apps can automatically read the headphone jack Like without like special permissions or anything and it appears that they can't do the same thing through the lightning connector.

242
00:14:01,682 --> 00:14:05,780
Rym: Apple could just say, you know that you might have to go through an Apple process to be able to get that data.

243
00:14:05,901 --> 00:14:08,820
Scott: I think the API you use is use the microphone API, right?

244
00:14:08,901 --> 00:14:17,158
Scott: because yeah you're basically like trying to record audio as if you were making like an audio recording app and then you just examine the data that Came in as not as audio but as bits, right?

245
00:14:17,178 --> 00:14:26,151
Scott: Yeah so I and so if you have right an app that uses say the say you say you made a Microphone recording app just a voice recorder.

246
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:37,371
Scott: Yep, and you know somebody installs that app on an iPhone 6 which has a microphone hole and iPhone 7 which won't You and the person plugs the microphone into the adapter into the lightning.

247
00:14:37,391 --> 00:14:43,940
Scott: that the same app with the same code won't record anything On the iPhone 7 and that's the question that does not sound right to me.

248
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:50,652
Scott: I have to believe that the app will still record the audio on the iPhone 7 Using the dongle if you're wearing one of those headsets with the microphone.

249
00:14:50,672 --> 00:14:52,880
Rym: Well, anyway, that is what I'm going to figure out for Monday.

250
00:14:53,062 --> 00:14:54,839
Scott: Yeah, I find it hard to believe anyway.

251
00:14:56,143 --> 00:14:58,200
Scott: So nothing there was a surprise or exciting.

252
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:02,759
Scott: I'm gonna wait and get the tiny iPhone which according to schedule should be out early next year.

253
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,792
Scott: Yeah, because the iPhone 7 isn't significantly better enough than my iPhone 6.

254
00:15:06,792 --> 00:15:08,638
Scott: There's no reason to rush out and get one.

255
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:17,839
Scott: Yeah anyway, but They did do something that was surprising which is they were like, hey Me and moto's here and we got some Nintendo games.

256
00:15:18,061 --> 00:15:23,771
Rym: That's the thing that many people have told us when we said hey someday Nintendo might just be a software company Just like Sega.

257
00:15:23,832 --> 00:15:24,719
Scott: that's not gonna happen.

258
00:15:25,701 --> 00:15:27,626
Scott: Making the NX they're making hardware.

259
00:15:28,047 --> 00:15:29,150
Scott: the 3ds is going strong.

260
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:31,476
Scott: They just made more 3ds stuff for now.

261
00:15:31,517 --> 00:15:32,800
Rym: We'll see anyway.

262
00:15:33,984 --> 00:15:39,892
Scott: but they're making a Somewhat more real Mario game for the iPhone for iOS.

263
00:15:40,032 --> 00:15:43,482
Scott: that will come out on Android way later because they got an exclusive deal With Apple.

264
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:48,860
Scott: so it seems like all the Nintendo games are gonna come out on iOS and then come out an Android way later.

265
00:15:49,462 --> 00:16:02,610
Rym: I do think that is a Resistant to mobile like deeply resistant and I think they were very afraid that if they embrace mobile gaming It would kill their portable console like a hundred percent.

266
00:16:03,072 --> 00:16:03,796
Scott: I think it's too late.

267
00:16:03,836 --> 00:16:04,760
Scott: It's regardless, right?

268
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:10,800
Scott: I think it's more that everyone's playing games on their phones and not killing playing on the portable console anyway.

269
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:22,680
Scott: Yeah, so you might as well put a Nintendo there and hopefully maybe you put some games that are mobile type games on there And you'll get people to like and realize that Nintendo shit is so much better than crappy iPhone shit.

270
00:16:22,961 --> 00:16:27,780
Rym: But will that convert people then buying a regular Nintendo portable console?

271
00:16:28,061 --> 00:16:35,480
Scott: I don't know if it'll convert enough people to move the needle and like the stock market But I think it only will definitely get some people.

272
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:42,342
Rym: I think it only will if there are still exclusive first-class games only on the console They're getting.

273
00:16:42,362 --> 00:16:43,608
Rym: those games are Pokemon games.

274
00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:45,135
Scott: There's no sign of that stopping.

275
00:16:45,377 --> 00:16:50,920
Scott: Yeah But I mean the game that they're coming out with is basically Mario runner Which is like the simplest Mario game.

276
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:55,960
Scott: All you do is he if there's a little jump like if Mario runs up to a goomba He's gonna jump on it automatically.

277
00:16:56,502 --> 00:17:04,492
Scott: You only basically tap your phone to make Mario jump and you tap more to make him jump higher and he runs to the right Without stopping and you pretty much only have to handle the big jumps.

278
00:17:04,874 --> 00:17:06,060
Scott: He's gonna handle little jumps.

279
00:17:06,362 --> 00:17:13,013
Scott: Yeah, but if you watch video footage of the game They've actually taken this runner concept which has been done before right?

280
00:17:13,255 --> 00:17:14,780
Rym: Yeah, those games are all mostly the same.

281
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,729
Scott: I remember really I remember really old games.

282
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:22,839
Scott: I mean, it's basically the same thing as uh, dude There was a game Adventure Island right with the kid on this the cave kid on the skateboard.

283
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,165
Rym: It wasn't always on the skateboard.

284
00:17:24,468 --> 00:17:26,980
Scott: No, but he basically just runs to the right and jumps right?

285
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:34,437
Rym: Well forget that on my ti-85 I had a game where you had a boulder a ball and it went forward and you had to jump obstacles.

286
00:17:34,477 --> 00:17:35,119
Scott: and I had that game.

287
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,710
Scott: I also had one that it was the same thing a guy on a skateboard.

288
00:17:37,851 --> 00:17:39,900
Scott: Yeah, I mean this bit trip runner.

289
00:17:40,222 --> 00:17:41,247
Scott: There's so many this.

290
00:17:41,287 --> 00:17:42,071
Scott: basically there's a games.

291
00:17:42,111 --> 00:17:43,780
Scott: There's a lot of games on the phone that are like this.

292
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,859
Scott: There's like I think temple run.

293
00:17:46,282 --> 00:17:50,000
Rym: But there's also runs the one that you see like kind of basic people playing camera.

294
00:17:50,162 --> 00:17:51,940
Scott: The camera is behind the guy running forward.

295
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,923
Rym: There's also a temple run equivalence with like Sonic the Hedgehog branding and so is this Nintendo just doing that the best that can be Done.

296
00:17:58,963 --> 00:18:02,729
Scott: right, but if you look at the video footage of this This is way better than those other runners.

297
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:05,000
Scott: cuz you know, it's got the Nintendo action, right?

298
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:09,255
Scott: It's like they put enough stuff into it that it's like oh, that's a level above.

299
00:18:09,295 --> 00:18:10,720
Scott: Those are the crappy run games.

300
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,200
Scott: Yeah, and also it's gonna be pay once get the game.

301
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:13,864
Scott: It's not gonna be.

302
00:18:13,905 --> 00:18:18,191
Scott: no if that's interesting because there was a lot of play It's not gonna be micro transaction.

303
00:18:18,493 --> 00:18:29,592
Rym: way back when Nintendo amounts fuck announced Pokemon go like when that was happening a lot of people were saying that this will be great because Nintendo will do micro transactions differently and they're gonna do it right.

304
00:18:30,013 --> 00:18:34,327
Rym: and then so far Pokemon go is basically just been the same old Bullshit because it's not made by Nintendo.

305
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,012
Rym: Yeah, so we'll.

306
00:18:36,112 --> 00:18:44,240
Rym: it'll be curious to see if these games are Basically just Nintendo variants of the existing ecosystem or if they actually do something different in the long run.

307
00:18:44,562 --> 00:18:47,942
Scott: No, I mean, they're just selling this game like you pay a few dollars or however We don't.

308
00:18:47,962 --> 00:18:50,092
Scott: they didn't say how many dollars yet, but you pay.

309
00:18:50,112 --> 00:18:53,920
Rym: that'll be interesting because I think $1.99 is already considered premium.

310
00:18:54,583 --> 00:19:00,650
Scott: I mean this can probably be sold for five bucks, but people would be like and Ten bucks would be way too much right.

311
00:19:01,092 --> 00:19:02,337
Scott: more than five would be too much.

312
00:19:02,397 --> 00:19:07,112
Scott: five would be like Alright fuck you less than that unless this game was somehow legit amazing.

313
00:19:07,372 --> 00:19:10,793
Scott: I mean, it's it's probably the best sideways running game There's gonna be ever.

314
00:19:12,782 --> 00:19:14,772
Scott: That I mean that depends what you think of sideways.

315
00:19:14,933 --> 00:19:15,395
Scott: just run.

316
00:19:15,435 --> 00:19:15,918
Rym: I mean run.

317
00:19:15,938 --> 00:19:20,091
Rym: yes guys This is the best Seattle downtown pizza ever exactly.

318
00:19:20,652 --> 00:19:22,177
Rym: people are giving me shit people out.

319
00:19:22,237 --> 00:19:23,220
Rym: I was like a pax.

320
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,485
Rym: I was like never delivered.

321
00:19:24,505 --> 00:19:26,131
Rym: delivered pizza in Seattle because holy shit.

322
00:19:26,312 --> 00:19:27,597
Scott: Well never ordered pizza anywhere.

323
00:19:27,617 --> 00:19:28,340
Scott: That's not New York City.

324
00:19:28,481 --> 00:19:31,120
Rym: So I'm gonna qualify that because if you were mad at me one.

325
00:19:31,821 --> 00:19:33,307
Rym: Yes, there is good pizza in Seattle.

326
00:19:33,347 --> 00:19:33,808
Rym: I've had it.

327
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:34,973
Rym: never delivery.

328
00:19:35,013 --> 00:19:36,720
Rym: It's only sit down in real restaurants.

329
00:19:36,921 --> 00:19:38,910
Scott: I've never seen any good pizza anywhere.

330
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:39,915
Scott: That's not New York City.

331
00:19:39,935 --> 00:19:42,707
Scott: I got good pizza Or close to New York.

332
00:19:42,727 --> 00:19:43,872
Rym: I got a really good pizza advance.

333
00:19:44,495 --> 00:19:45,660
Scott: It's not real pizza.

334
00:19:45,781 --> 00:19:46,264
Rym: Yeah, was it?

335
00:19:46,284 --> 00:19:47,613
Rym: was it you and your fucking real pizza?

336
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:48,700
Rym: It was a fine real pizza.

337
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:51,480
Rym: It was that thin crust like the stuff you get at a fancy Italian restaurant.

338
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:51,942
Rym: That was good.

339
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:53,932
Rym: problem is can't get that delivered.

340
00:19:54,354 --> 00:19:57,088
Rym: and one of you was like oh But there's good pizza if you order it from.

341
00:19:57,289 --> 00:19:59,380
Rym: and they named places that do not deliver downtown.

342
00:20:00,941 --> 00:20:05,275
Rym: And even better some of you were like, oh what about this place?

343
00:20:05,336 --> 00:20:06,339
Rym: they're legit good.

344
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:09,208
Rym: I Researched all the places that people thought.

345
00:20:09,228 --> 00:20:11,859
Rym: well the three places that people told me were legit good.

346
00:20:12,643 --> 00:20:15,580
Rym: Over the years that packs we have ordered from all of those places.

347
00:20:16,443 --> 00:20:21,200
Rym: And if you think that's good pizza, I will never eat food that is in your proximity again.

348
00:20:21,942 --> 00:20:24,732
Scott: I think the thing is is just people who don't live in New York.

349
00:20:24,793 --> 00:20:27,786
Scott: They haven't had real pizza, dude I grew up in Michigan.

350
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:30,100
Rym: I knew a good pizza was like when I got to New York.

351
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,828
Scott: I thought in Michigan all you had was Pizza Hut.

352
00:20:32,371 --> 00:20:33,456
Rym: if you want to chain you could.

353
00:20:33,476 --> 00:20:34,180
Rym: there were fancy places.

354
00:20:34,241 --> 00:20:35,659
Rym: You could sit down but they didn't deliver.

355
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,026
Rym: But the point is delivery pizza.

356
00:20:38,066 --> 00:20:39,670
Scott: you haven't had the good stuff.

357
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:42,137
Scott: because like people like don't like.

358
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,463
Rym: they think five guys is a good Burger.

359
00:20:43,685 --> 00:20:45,340
Scott: well, people don't even know what a bagel is, right?

360
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,049
Scott: I mean it's recently is the 70s or even 80s.

361
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:50,055
Scott: There just weren't bagels anywhere.

362
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:54,500
Scott: That wasn't like Brooklyn, New York You know, you just if you were in like, I don't know, Florida.

363
00:20:54,681 --> 00:20:55,767
Scott: There wasn't a bagel like.

364
00:20:55,828 --> 00:20:56,532
Scott: you couldn't get one.

365
00:20:56,874 --> 00:20:57,880
Scott: you have to make it yourself.

366
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:58,943
Scott: They weren't available.

367
00:20:59,004 --> 00:21:01,612
Scott: and now bagels are everywhere, but you still can't.

368
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:03,860
Scott: you can only get real bagels in very few places.

369
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,900
Scott: It's very likely that most most people on earth do not live near a place that bakes real bagels.

370
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,979
Scott: They probably never tasted a real bagel.

371
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:18,691
Scott: Do not realize their bagel that they have had is shitty Because they haven't had a real one.

372
00:21:18,771 --> 00:21:26,600
Scott: and in fact when they encounter a real one They might mistakenly say it's shitty because they like the thing they're used to because they're a typical human who doesn't like change.

373
00:21:26,881 --> 00:21:28,746
Rym: Nobody actually likes like.

374
00:21:28,786 --> 00:21:29,848
Rym: they choke it down.

375
00:21:29,868 --> 00:21:31,914
Scott: They enjoy familiarity over quality.

376
00:21:32,054 --> 00:21:34,320
Rym: Nobody likes that that mid-america bagel.

377
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:40,897
Rym: They say they like it because they resent your New York attitude and they choke it down crying inside the whole time.

378
00:21:41,278 --> 00:21:51,900
Rym: They know But listen, I'm gonna put it this way this the pizza that is able to be ordered in downtown Seattle is shit here even by Albany or Detroit standards.

379
00:21:52,463 --> 00:21:53,630
Scott: I mean the pizza we had.

380
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:57,106
Rym: I'm not comparing it to New York City I'm comparing it to like taste buds.

381
00:21:57,146 --> 00:22:01,783
Scott: the pizza that we ordered and delivered and that was like the line of edible at this most Recent bags.

382
00:22:01,923 --> 00:22:05,275
Rym: that was the best we've ordered yet and I was like at the bottom line.

383
00:22:05,376 --> 00:22:07,707
Scott: It was an edible pizza Barely, it would.

384
00:22:08,372 --> 00:22:13,159
Rym: it was not like ew gross I'm not eating this but it was like like there's the line below which not eating this.

385
00:22:13,702 --> 00:22:18,840
Rym: It was like a little bit above that line, but it's not not much room to fall, you know, it's like I'm hungry.

386
00:22:19,021 --> 00:22:19,743
Scott: I need something.

387
00:22:19,944 --> 00:22:20,847
Scott: here is a pizza.

388
00:22:21,148 --> 00:22:23,417
Scott: I will eat some of it and fill my stomach.

389
00:22:23,477 --> 00:22:25,225
Rym: had I not been hungry I would not have eaten it.

390
00:22:25,667 --> 00:22:28,000
Scott: No, I mean if I'm not hungry, I don't eat anything.

391
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:32,194
Scott: Wouldn't even eat the world's most delicious pizza if I wasn't hungry.

392
00:22:32,274 --> 00:22:34,544
Rym: if I'd been only a little hungry I wouldn't have eaten it.

393
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:36,935
Rym: I only ate it because I was desperately hungry.

394
00:22:37,015 --> 00:22:38,000
Scott: I wasn't desperately hungry.

395
00:22:38,181 --> 00:22:39,897
Rym: I was because I ate a light lunch.

396
00:22:40,482 --> 00:22:43,055
Rym: Anyway, yeah, but I just said so.

397
00:22:43,136 --> 00:22:46,206
Rym: in terms of Nintendo Pokemon go still going.

398
00:22:46,226 --> 00:22:48,233
Scott: I guess why would it not be going?

399
00:22:48,273 --> 00:22:49,257
Scott: it's not Pokemon stop.

400
00:22:49,558 --> 00:23:05,635
Rym: Well According to Bloomberg and a few other people Engagement in the Pokemon app has fallen off precipitously as All the people who are actual gamers who like for whatever reason expected this game to be made way more than it was Hit the wall of.

401
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:10,740
Rym: well I can't really level up much more unless I grind and they all stop playing it.

402
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,467
Scott: I mean, that's every single thing.

403
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:15,400
Scott: every single game that has just grinding is mechanic.

404
00:23:15,521 --> 00:23:19,397
Scott: Yeah gets a ton of players because at the early part, it's super funny.

405
00:23:19,417 --> 00:23:20,180
Rym: Like yeah, I got a level.

406
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,586
Rym: Yeah, ten levels loop by loop.

407
00:23:21,626 --> 00:23:23,876
Scott: There's so much low-hanging fruits together.

408
00:23:23,896 --> 00:23:30,045
Scott: It's like we for your brain and then Eventually, just like I. that's enough of that.

409
00:23:30,106 --> 00:23:40,520
Scott: if you look at like all those Facebook games like the Mafia whatever is in the Farmville Yeah, they were actually dying before Facebook sort of cut off their sharing mechanism.

410
00:23:40,641 --> 00:23:43,353
Scott: He hit that upper limit all those zinga games like.

411
00:23:43,373 --> 00:23:48,280
Scott: they got crushed zinga Right because people played all those games like crazy and then they were done with them.

412
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,011
Scott: They they don't have staying power.

413
00:23:50,031 --> 00:23:52,539
Scott: if you want a game to have staying power You want people to keep playing it?

414
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:57,060
Scott: It has to have substance that keeps you know brains interested for a long time.

415
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:09,493
Rym: I guess what's interesting with Pokemon go is that just because it wasn't it was a it was Pokemon that IP a Lot of people who would otherwise never even look at a game like this Double down on it and for whatever reason they.

416
00:24:09,734 --> 00:24:10,740
Rym: it's almost like in VR.

417
00:24:10,861 --> 00:24:20,059
Rym: Like there's a concept in VR where if you make an object too realistic, then the player Expects it to behave more realistically and when it doesn't it messes them up.

418
00:24:20,622 --> 00:24:24,299
Rym: So if you want if you're not gonna make something complex, you can't make it look complex.

419
00:24:24,983 --> 00:24:34,260
Rym: So people just looked at this and said oh Pokemon Pokemon's got a lot going on and started trying to IV train their Pokemon and Pokemon go because that's gonna matter ever.

420
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:37,108
Rym: No, so one by one those people are realizing.

421
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,656
Rym: Oh, there isn't anything like nothing.

422
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:40,920
Rym: Nothing's gonna be different.

423
00:24:41,442 --> 00:24:43,850
Rym: It's just see more Pokemon and take more funny pictures.

424
00:24:43,931 --> 00:24:44,874
Scott: It's exactly what we said.

425
00:24:44,894 --> 00:24:46,540
Scott: It was go back and listen to old GeekNights.

426
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:50,368
Scott: I'm sure you'll find a me saying before the release of Pokemon go.

427
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:53,667
Scott: this will be Ingress with Pokemon skin.

428
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:55,173
Scott: Yeah, that's exactly what it is.

429
00:24:55,194 --> 00:24:55,897
Scott: I was 100% right.

430
00:24:56,782 --> 00:24:57,819
Scott: Yep, cuz I'm smart.

431
00:24:58,141 --> 00:25:00,675
Rym: So they added a new feature the Pokemon go buddy system.

432
00:25:01,238 --> 00:25:02,665
Rym: and you know We call these games like we did.

433
00:25:02,685 --> 00:25:05,980
Scott: our lecture is just share with people to level up faster.

434
00:25:06,101 --> 00:25:08,219
Rym: No, you know how we call these games candy box games, right?

435
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:12,180
Rym: Well in Pokemon go the only way to evolve or level up Pokemon is to get candy.

436
00:25:12,663 --> 00:25:14,273
Rym: Okay, just like a candy box.

437
00:25:14,353 --> 00:25:15,400
Rym: Literally you get candy.

438
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:19,620
Rym: So if you want to level up like if you want to evolve a man handy now just candy.

439
00:25:19,902 --> 00:25:21,959
Rym: But the candy is tied to each species line.

440
00:25:22,665 --> 00:25:28,612
Rym: So if you want to level up a Bulbasaur Bulbasaur candy if you Can you can use these.

441
00:25:28,632 --> 00:25:28,834
Rym: you can.

442
00:25:28,934 --> 00:25:29,256
Rym: it's all.

443
00:25:29,296 --> 00:25:30,000
Rym: bubbles are candy.

444
00:25:30,165 --> 00:25:30,478
Rym: Okay.

445
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:34,255
Scott: So if you don't know you want to level up your Venusaur you got to give it Bulbasaur candy.

446
00:25:34,396 --> 00:25:38,957
Rym: or you can grind up Bulbasaurs or Venusaurs or Ivysaur so you can't give it dragon eyes.

447
00:25:39,178 --> 00:25:39,338
Rym: Nope.

448
00:25:40,182 --> 00:25:45,480
Rym: But for example to evolve a Magikarp you need 400 Magikarp candies.

449
00:25:45,901 --> 00:25:46,464
Scott: That's a lot.

450
00:25:46,624 --> 00:25:48,814
Rym: you get candies every time you catch a Pokemon of that type.

451
00:25:48,934 --> 00:25:49,638
Scott: You got to catch 400 Magikarp.

452
00:25:50,601 --> 00:25:56,315
Rym: So now they've added buddies when you pick one of your Pokemon and they're gonna appear on the map walking around.

453
00:25:57,257 --> 00:26:04,035
Rym: and what they do is You get a certain number of candies per kilometer that you walk of that type.

454
00:26:04,536 --> 00:26:06,785
Rym: It's literally just CPS.

455
00:26:06,846 --> 00:26:09,360
Rym: it's just candies per second or in this case candies per kilometer.

456
00:26:09,681 --> 00:26:11,025
Rym: It's just candy box.

457
00:26:11,246 --> 00:26:15,138
Rym: Pokemon goes buddy system is the lollipop farm in candy box.

458
00:26:15,479 --> 00:26:17,944
Rym: Yeah And That's it.

459
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,791
Rym: That's the new feature that everyone's excited about.

460
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:21,456
Rym: you can everyone.

461
00:26:21,537 --> 00:26:25,949
Rym: you can turn on Another grind machine that grinds by itself.

462
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:28,116
Rym: So you have to click less to grind.

463
00:26:28,397 --> 00:26:43,683
Rym: that is literally the feature They added and this article I found one one step further and they actually calculated You have to walk 400 kilometers to evolve a Gyarados from a Magikarp, yes 400 kilometers.

464
00:26:44,004 --> 00:26:49,379
Rym: and remember Pokemon go if you run it decides you're not walking and that shit doesn't count.

465
00:26:50,381 --> 00:26:50,562
Rym: What?

466
00:26:50,843 --> 00:26:53,252
Rym: yeah, I thought when the game first started like oh, whatever.

467
00:26:53,533 --> 00:26:55,120
Rym: I'll just fill all those incubators with eggs.

468
00:26:55,584 --> 00:26:59,308
Rym: And you know, I run like every day I'll have every goddamn Pokemon in the world.

469
00:26:59,328 --> 00:27:05,611
Rym: and no it doesn't count my running unless I run less than like three and a half Miles an hour, which that's a New York walk.

470
00:27:05,631 --> 00:27:06,674
Rym: speed is faster than that.

471
00:27:06,855 --> 00:27:07,618
Scott: biking doesn't work.

472
00:27:07,819 --> 00:27:10,045
Rym: No Only walking.

473
00:27:10,065 --> 00:27:11,433
Rym: Okay, you go too fast.

474
00:27:11,493 --> 00:27:12,096
Rym: It doesn't count.

475
00:27:12,116 --> 00:27:15,993
Scott: All right Maybe they should increase that speeds like 20.

476
00:27:15,993 --> 00:27:19,915
Rym: No Cuz then people would just put it on like a bike and ride around all day and get everything.

477
00:27:19,955 --> 00:27:20,558
Rym: remember you got.

478
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,324
Rym: you got to Keep that grind slow.

479
00:27:22,585 --> 00:27:24,491
Scott: You shouldn't give the points per kilometer.

480
00:27:24,512 --> 00:27:26,980
Scott: You should get the points per time spent moving.

481
00:27:27,261 --> 00:27:27,863
Rym: Yeah, and you know what?

482
00:27:27,883 --> 00:27:40,730
Rym: The answer to that is you put your poker you put your cell phone or in your dongle on your Roomba but anyway things of the day.

483
00:27:41,131 --> 00:27:45,830
Rym: So this is a bunch of tweets and it's basically a bunch of tweets as you think of the day.

484
00:27:46,091 --> 00:27:48,170
Rym: Well, what it is is you remember way back?

485
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:55,335
Rym: they were talking about how Lego universe had their problem with penises and how they had their penis detector to detect if people made Penises to remove them.

486
00:27:55,937 --> 00:28:05,822
Rym: Well, it appears to be a little bit of an expose of some people talking about how this actually worked and Apparently making the software detect dongs was actually impossible.

487
00:28:05,842 --> 00:28:17,032
Rym: Of course it is and they actually just had Whitelists and humans literally looking at everything and one by one approving Everything.

488
00:28:17,413 --> 00:28:23,470
Scott: this is how you saw the recent news at the Facebook and the Norwegian person posting the Vietnam photo.

489
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:26,710
Scott: Yeah, and the Prime Minister of Norway being pissed and whatnot.

490
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,135
Scott: it's because Facebook does the same thing.

491
00:28:28,175 --> 00:28:38,570
Scott: Facebook has an army of very lowly paid people who look at all the Facebook posts and Choose to report or filter or escalate them based on like some content guidelines given by Facebook.

492
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:42,223
Scott: The mod the human modern a computer does not do this work.

493
00:28:42,625 --> 00:28:44,130
Rym: They actually had a huge moderation team.

494
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:48,830
Rym: They got a bunch of screenshots of every model every property entirely whitelist based building.

495
00:28:49,372 --> 00:28:55,090
Rym: You could build whatever you wanted, but strangers could never see your builds until we'd had a team to a penis sweep on it.

496
00:28:55,815 --> 00:28:56,782
Rym: It was all automated.

497
00:28:56,843 --> 00:28:57,709
Rym: Here's the interesting part.

498
00:28:58,151 --> 00:29:12,490
Rym: But the human moderators were I are see the single biggest cost center for Lego universes operational costs That cost more than anything and the only reason this is the case is because of the the child online Protection Act.

499
00:29:13,132 --> 00:29:13,292
Scott: Mm-hmm.

500
00:29:13,593 --> 00:29:27,334
Rym: Copa is the reason why so many things that are good online Technically say you can't use this if you're a kid Fuck you, and frankly the advice in this tweets at the end is like guys if you want to make a game Never let kids play it.

501
00:29:27,374 --> 00:29:27,715
Rym: you're fuck.

502
00:29:27,735 --> 00:29:29,620
Rym: You can't make something fun period.

503
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:41,250
Rym: you cannot have anything online if kids would play it at all And they tell this story even about how one of the developers made a dick in a sandbox to test the moderation system.

504
00:29:41,752 --> 00:29:49,464
Rym: But then someone else actually took a bunch of kids while they were doing a kid's day Into that property and they saw the dick and apparently that was a four alarm.

505
00:29:49,504 --> 00:29:50,608
Rym: Somebody's getting fired.

506
00:29:50,669 --> 00:29:51,704
Rym: incident Mm-hmm.

507
00:29:52,051 --> 00:29:55,930
Rym: I'm curious what that dick looked like because that's one of the people who's like a developer on Lego universe.

508
00:29:56,332 --> 00:29:59,089
Rym: They had to have some really high quality dick building capabilities.

509
00:30:00,533 --> 00:30:13,789
Rym: this is all just fascinating and I guess the moral is if you ever make an online game like if I ever make one I'm just gonna say if you're under 13 You're not allowed to play and I'm sure that you're actually born on January 1st 1901 and everything will be

510
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:13,930
Scott: fine.

511
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,849
Scott: I'm just gonna put my servers in some other country.

512
00:30:16,472 --> 00:30:20,547
Scott: Oh, yeah, that's oh and then not get bother getting it rated by the ESRB.

513
00:30:20,567 --> 00:30:21,210
Scott: You just have a game.

514
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:23,798
Rym: Yeah But seriously Copa is one of the most.

515
00:30:24,139 --> 00:30:29,443
Rym: like we talked about laws that affect people a lot more and a lot more dangerous Copa is just a bad law.

516
00:30:29,463 --> 00:30:30,570
Scott: I mean you can just go to a porn site.

517
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,453
Scott: This is are you 18?

518
00:30:31,453 --> 00:30:32,939
Scott: you say yes, and then you see porn.

519
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:33,360
Scott: Yep.

520
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:37,839
Rym: So really everyone under the age of 13 Go actually go on January 1st, 1901.

521
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:45,070
Scott: you go on Steam and there's a game rated You know a oh and this scene doesn't have a OA games, but game rated M and they're like, what's your birthday?

522
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:46,737
Scott: My birthday is 1934.

523
00:30:46,737 --> 00:30:48,124
Scott: Well, you can see this game now.

524
00:30:48,325 --> 00:30:48,607
Rym: Yep.

525
00:30:48,928 --> 00:30:53,918
Scott: All right I do but at first I'm gonna ask you some questions.

526
00:30:53,978 --> 00:30:54,480
Scott: All right Rym.

527
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,643
Scott: Oh, here's a quiz.

528
00:30:56,065 --> 00:31:04,627
Scott: Oh, can you sing for me a Song or hum or whistle or whatever a song from the soundtrack of Star Wars?

529
00:31:08,211 --> 00:31:09,957
Rym: Okay, good, you got it for all you.

530
00:31:09,997 --> 00:31:10,900
Rym: I didn't finish anything.

531
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,585
Scott: it's alright you're good enough, right?

532
00:31:12,846 --> 00:31:13,950
Scott: Can you do the same?

533
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:19,289
Scott: For a song from the soundtrack of any James Bond movie ever?

534
00:31:20,092 --> 00:31:20,935
Rym: Dude, dude.

535
00:31:21,236 --> 00:31:21,879
Rym: Okay good.

536
00:31:21,899 --> 00:31:22,240
Rym: All right.

537
00:31:22,843 --> 00:31:24,389
Scott: Can you do the same for any?

538
00:31:25,431 --> 00:31:28,849
Scott: Any song from the soundtrack of the good the bad and the ugly?

539
00:31:32,032 --> 00:31:33,141
Scott: Oh you just suck.

540
00:31:33,363 --> 00:31:36,153
Rym: yeah, I just think Well, that's easy.

541
00:31:36,213 --> 00:31:43,121
Rym: I'm thinking more like I imagine a sweeping instrumental spread in the background, but I don't have that At any point do.

542
00:31:46,074 --> 00:31:46,980
Scott: Anyway, that's easy.

543
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:51,929
Rym: one is the point also, I can't whistle the And you didn't want to hear my voice make that sounds.

544
00:31:53,151 --> 00:31:56,461
Scott: Well, anyway, that's really all right you ready?

545
00:31:56,922 --> 00:31:58,708
Scott: here's the one that I do not think you will get.

546
00:31:58,728 --> 00:31:58,808
Scott: okay.

547
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:16,407
Scott: Sing a song from the soundtrack of any Marvel Universe movie Ironman spider-man's Avengers Captain America's anything I'm doors hulks.

548
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:18,735
Rym: I Just imagined generic.

549
00:32:18,776 --> 00:32:21,630
Rym: I can't I cannot I can't even think of like a light motif.

550
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:22,311
Rym: Nope.

551
00:32:22,873 --> 00:32:23,516
Scott: No, you can't.

552
00:32:23,596 --> 00:32:24,459
Scott: and do you know why?

553
00:32:24,841 --> 00:32:26,065
Rym: because they don't use like motifs.

554
00:32:26,105 --> 00:32:26,346
Rym: is that?

555
00:32:26,406 --> 00:32:27,290
Rym: is that what's going on here?

556
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:32,926
Scott: No But here's a video those posted today from every frame of painting that explains how shit their music is.

557
00:32:32,966 --> 00:32:35,654
Scott: every frame of painting and he Says exactly they go into.

558
00:32:35,835 --> 00:32:40,030
Scott: they start off the video by interviewing people on the street saying can you sing a Star Wars?

559
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:41,749
Scott: Can you sit and then can you do him?

560
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,576
Scott: Hey, and there's one.

561
00:32:43,716 --> 00:32:49,798
Scott: I actually thought of a Marvel song despite not having seen any of those movies And I was like, oh I thought of one.

562
00:32:49,939 --> 00:32:52,169
Scott: I know it and a guy sings it at the end of the video.

563
00:32:54,516 --> 00:33:06,463
Rym: But Yeah, when I think about it like when I want a lot of movies like I can remember like like Princess Leia has her theme and like all like the Imperial stormtroopers have their theme like things have themes and movies.

564
00:33:06,885 --> 00:33:08,189
Rym: I don't know what Iron Man's theme is.

565
00:33:08,511 --> 00:33:09,014
Scott: He doesn't have.

566
00:33:09,054 --> 00:33:10,683
Rym: but I think the same song the plays when he's fighting.

567
00:33:10,703 --> 00:33:11,850
Scott: this video is fascinating.

568
00:33:12,254 --> 00:33:14,130
Scott: Also, I somewhat disagree with the video.

569
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:16,037
Scott: I think there's a point that he just doesn't.

570
00:33:16,258 --> 00:33:18,245
Scott: he gets close to making but doesn't make.

571
00:33:18,285 --> 00:33:24,818
Scott: but regardless, you know the video is really interesting and He really shits on.

572
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:27,390
Scott: you know, modern movies and their soundtracks.

573
00:33:27,582 --> 00:33:28,612
Rym: Yeah Well, you know what?

574
00:33:28,652 --> 00:33:35,690
Rym: The problem is I think a lot of more recent movies often have larger larger soundtracks smaller scores.

575
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:41,846
Rym: Nope, or no, they have scores that are basically the same as other scores.

576
00:33:41,987 --> 00:33:42,348
Scott: Yes.

577
00:33:42,889 --> 00:33:54,648
Scott: Yes But another thing is that I was think for a long time I was like man, they just don't make like symphonic, you know soundtracks or movies.

578
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:58,077
Scott: these days Every fucking movie has one.

579
00:33:58,097 --> 00:34:01,069
Scott: They're just such garbage that you don't you don't even realize that they're there.

580
00:34:02,111 --> 00:34:05,446
Scott: There's a fantastic unless it's like a Lord of the Rings situation.

581
00:34:05,467 --> 00:34:05,909
Scott: Yeah, right.

582
00:34:07,872 --> 00:34:10,429
Rym: So, there you go watch this that that actually sounds really good.

583
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:11,014
Rym: I know.

584
00:34:11,074 --> 00:34:18,704
Scott: also it's like, you know, I haven't seen these movies but you know and I don't know if they're good or bad even because I haven't seen them and I don't really want to.

585
00:34:19,106 --> 00:34:21,053
Scott: but if someone's gonna Shit on something.

586
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:23,982
Scott: I haven't seen that everyone else seems to like that's.

587
00:34:24,123 --> 00:34:24,965
Rym: that's up your alley.

588
00:34:25,005 --> 00:34:25,567
Scott: Yeah, why not?

589
00:34:25,848 --> 00:34:29,094
Rym: Yeah Well think actually think back.

590
00:34:29,396 --> 00:34:36,217
Rym: Final Fantasy 4 & 6 had very good scores Like motifs all you know, the.

591
00:34:36,318 --> 00:34:38,605
Scott: every Final Fantasy has a good score.

592
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:44,130
Scott: every Final Fantasy Sure every Final Fantasy, yeah, even the shitty ones have good music.

593
00:34:44,571 --> 00:34:49,610
Rym: Well, do you can't do you count American games that had the Final Fantasy brand or only actual Final Fantasy games?

594
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:51,956
Scott: I mean even Final Fantasy Legend 3 has good music.

595
00:34:52,319 --> 00:34:54,545
Rym: What about Final Fantasy mystic quests?

596
00:34:54,847 --> 00:34:55,630
Scott: I don't remember.

597
00:34:55,831 --> 00:34:57,620
Rym: You don't remember that game because I don't remember the music.

598
00:34:57,861 --> 00:34:59,710
Rym: Yeah that game not good, but I remember they're like.

599
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:03,954
Rym: You know, it probably is.

600
00:35:03,974 --> 00:35:06,722
Rym: the best soundtrack in modern gaming though is actually undertale.

601
00:35:07,163 --> 00:35:11,532
Rym: Mm-hmm is a full score with It's.

602
00:35:11,852 --> 00:35:14,218
Rym: it's one of my favorite game soundtracks of all time.

603
00:35:14,258 --> 00:35:17,304
Scott: like not portals or portals.

604
00:35:17,505 --> 00:35:19,610
Rym: soundtrack is actually kind of forgettable.

605
00:35:20,896 --> 00:35:21,744
Rym: How many thing from it?

606
00:35:24,432 --> 00:35:27,750
Rym: The voice acting is memorable, but the music is.

607
00:35:29,735 --> 00:35:38,269
Rym: No, yeah that song the theme of the entire series that song Yeah, the one that plays on the radio in the beginning and then you hear at the end with the yeah that song.

608
00:35:39,891 --> 00:35:42,304
Rym: Seriously even if you don't play under tails listen to the soundtrack y'all.

609
00:35:42,324 --> 00:35:43,470
Rym: do the score the score.

610
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:44,134
Rym: It's not a soundtrack.

611
00:35:44,154 --> 00:35:44,617
Rym: It's a score.

612
00:35:44,999 --> 00:35:50,870
Scott: Yeah, the point is if I'm making a movie You know or anything that has music I'm making the music not suck.

613
00:35:51,352 --> 00:36:04,125
Rym: What was there was that there was a I think it was a college humor video a long time ago where they were like we're gonna make another movie and They get the soundtrack guy in and it's just him like miming what the soundtrack is gonna be like.

614
00:36:04,386 --> 00:36:09,030
Rym: and they go through making like Tenton Burton movies in a row and they all have the exact same soundtrack.

615
00:36:10,632 --> 00:36:13,407
Rym: So in the moment, the book club book was works and great.

616
00:36:13,447 --> 00:36:14,492
Rym: We did the episode It's done.

617
00:36:14,512 --> 00:36:18,870
Rym: the book club now, which Scott is not posted yet is Rebecca.

618
00:36:22,553 --> 00:36:25,990
Rym: Our last panel of the grind at PAX West was successful.

619
00:36:26,411 --> 00:36:29,561
Rym: Hopefully it'll be on YouTube whenever I get a chance to actually edit that together.

620
00:36:30,183 --> 00:36:33,168
Rym: We don't have any conventions until magfest.

621
00:36:34,397 --> 00:36:35,009
Rym: Finally a break.

622
00:36:35,672 --> 00:36:38,100
Rym: That means we're gonna be up in all our other content cuz.

623
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:41,350
Rym: finally I don't have all these like big things hanging over my head.

624
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:43,502
Rym: No more ConnectiCon no more packs for a while.

625
00:36:43,522 --> 00:36:45,050
Scott: All right, we're gonna make our own convention.

626
00:36:45,632 --> 00:36:48,324
Rym: Uh, yeah, we're gonna do that, but that's not gonna be till 2018.

627
00:36:48,324 --> 00:36:51,221
Rym: Mm-hmm 2017 is the planning year.

628
00:36:51,241 --> 00:36:54,461
Rym: Mm-hmm Yeah, what else?

629
00:36:54,481 --> 00:36:55,589
Rym: I don't think we have anything else going on.

630
00:36:55,750 --> 00:37:04,390
Rym: It's just watch all our internet stuff because Scott's YouTube channel my YouTube channel All our stuff is gonna have a lot more stuff in the coming months.

631
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:14,907
Rym: So I saw a bunch of people on Twitter just you know for a week or so like saying something something Captain sonar and they post a picture and the picture they always posted was the one.

632
00:37:14,947 --> 00:37:19,190
Rym: I just pulled it right here And it shows like these little charge-up dials and a picture of a submarine.

633
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:26,350
Scott: Well, my friend my friend Chris who plays netrunner is moving to Seattle But is moving like on Wednesday and wasn't able to move before packs.

634
00:37:27,451 --> 00:37:30,585
Scott: He told me about captain sonar and I said that game sounds amazing.

635
00:37:30,625 --> 00:37:31,730
Scott: and then we got to packs there.

636
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:39,780
Scott: It was so he played it at packs and then just yesterday I was in the game store for a netrunner tournament and I was telling you know We're just chatting it up before the tournament.

637
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,110
Scott: I said, yeah, this is great game.

638
00:37:41,452 --> 00:37:44,170
Scott: I played a packs captain sonar and everyone was like, oh that sounds awesome.

639
00:37:44,613 --> 00:37:45,319
Scott: And then I lost.

640
00:37:45,339 --> 00:37:46,629
Scott: so I had to buy in the round two.

641
00:37:47,271 --> 00:37:54,802
Scott: And then I walked around the store just looking around and there captain sonar was for 50 bucks and I said Well, I could buy this and we can play it like right the fuck.

642
00:37:54,843 --> 00:37:56,310
Scott: after this netrunner tournament everybody.

643
00:37:56,310 --> 00:38:05,590
Scott: Yeah, as long as they get Rym to pay for it Which I did because Scott said hey they got it and I went on Amazon and it was $104 on Amazon is 50 bucks at the store and I had store credit.

644
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:09,770
Scott: So I'll charge you slightly less because it's a used once copy of that on Amazon.

645
00:38:10,134 --> 00:38:11,470
Rym: Well, I didn't buy the captain sonar.

646
00:38:11,791 --> 00:38:16,667
Rym: I saw fresh fish for $38 and I saw deep-sea adventure for like 11.

647
00:38:16,667 --> 00:38:17,470
Rym: So I bought both of those.

648
00:38:18,291 --> 00:38:20,016
Scott: But yeah, so captain sonar this game.

649
00:38:20,758 --> 00:38:23,807
Scott: So in the world of games that are co-op, right?

650
00:38:23,827 --> 00:38:24,850
Scott: We have a lot of problems.

651
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:26,697
Scott: For example, we got pandemic.

652
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:29,669
Scott: where the pandemic problem is is just basically backing.

653
00:38:29,829 --> 00:38:41,919
Scott: Yeah It's a solitaire game and you just happen to unofficially divide the work between four people and there isn't really any Actual separation because you can share all the information.

654
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,987
Scott: Yeah, and the rules are bullshit, whatever.

655
00:38:44,007 --> 00:38:44,950
Rym: I think we're fine.

656
00:38:45,051 --> 00:38:46,410
Rym: Yeah, we've talked about this.

657
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:49,885
Scott: You've got the traitor kind where it's bullshit because obviously the traitor isn't.

658
00:38:49,925 --> 00:38:50,970
Scott: it then becomes pandemic.

659
00:38:51,432 --> 00:38:55,690
Scott: You've got the pandemic legacy, I guess slightly better than regular pandemic.

660
00:38:56,051 --> 00:38:59,630
Rym: I played more a role-playing game slash experience, which is fine.

661
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:03,743
Scott: Yeah game puzzle solving part is not really the problem with those games.

662
00:39:03,904 --> 00:39:05,850
Rym: They don't have a lot of replay value by design.

663
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:15,170
Rym: Yeah So got the beautiful Hanabi style where you're forced not to share information and it or there are strict rules around sharing information Which itself is the core of the game.

664
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:23,430
Scott: Yes You've got the real-time kind the space alert in the x-com where the real-time nature of it forces you to co-op because no one Can do all that work in such a short amount of time.

665
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:29,050
Rym: But that real time has to be facilitated by a third party be it an app a recording or a human.

666
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:34,910
Scott: Yeah, you got the versus kind where there's a Dracula right fury Dracula where there's a person you're up against.

667
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:40,870
Scott: So four people are co-oping against one person on teams, but furry of Dracula has problems with the combat parts.

668
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:46,083
Rym: Part is good Yeah No and also that genre of like a bunch of people versus one person.

669
00:39:46,546 --> 00:39:53,050
Rym: that's basically just Facilitated gaming and it's actually that's really the same as hero quest in some ways and that genre is fine.

670
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:55,689
Rym: It's just any individual implementation of it might be good or bad

671
00:39:56,011 --> 00:40:08,125
Scott: but captain sonar brings to the table something that is very rare even with all the board games in the world and that is Team versus team two teams going against each other just like football or any other sport.

672
00:40:08,245 --> 00:40:14,750
Rym: on for real time and the real For and it's real time, but the thing is I heard that and I thought that's cool.

673
00:40:15,312 --> 00:40:21,017
Rym: But then when I was told that not only is it foreign for real time You do not need a facilitator.

674
00:40:21,057 --> 00:40:24,489
Rym: The game is self facilitating and there is no app or anything.

675
00:40:24,629 --> 00:40:26,481
Scott: Yep It's just four on four and that's it.

676
00:40:26,562 --> 00:40:27,730
Rym: And then I said what the fuck?

677
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:28,495
Rym: How do you do that?

678
00:40:28,595 --> 00:40:30,550
Rym: And that's because the people who made this game are brilliant.

679
00:40:30,692 --> 00:40:31,969
Scott: Let me tell you how this shit works.

680
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:35,049
Scott: So first of all, you're paying 50 bucks and there's not a lot of stuff in the box.

681
00:40:35,311 --> 00:40:36,480
Scott: You can make this game.

682
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,407
Scott: You don't need to buy it.

683
00:40:37,528 --> 00:40:41,323
Rym: Yes I'd say buy it because like this game design is legit.

684
00:40:41,443 --> 00:40:43,270
Scott: Yeah, I mean, yeah, the game design is legit.

685
00:40:43,451 --> 00:40:48,010
Scott: Also, you really want to make like some sort of shield wall to separate four people from four other people.

686
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:52,430
Rym: We're on all the boards and all that stuff comes with dry erase markers.

687
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:54,890
Scott: They're nice, even though they're shitty by replacements on Amazon.

688
00:40:55,613 --> 00:41:00,133
Scott: Figure out which ones are best on Amazon or probably the ones you would use in an overhead Projector those guys.

689
00:41:00,234 --> 00:41:01,659
Rym: Yeah, that kind exactly.

690
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:04,210
Rym: Yeah, you're writing on that transparency if you're there exactly.

691
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:05,715
Scott: So here's how this works.

692
00:41:06,016 --> 00:41:10,210
Scott: each team of four is on a submarine in the water.

693
00:41:11,431 --> 00:41:12,613
Rym: There's some backstory whatever.

694
00:41:12,853 --> 00:41:14,737
Rym: you don't like you don't care about that and you don't like each other.

695
00:41:14,757 --> 00:41:23,501
Scott: you have the same map and You say the captain's on each team say dive And you die and then the game begins.

696
00:41:23,561 --> 00:41:25,630
Scott: once everyone dives and here's how it works.

697
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:27,859
Scott: The captain chooses any starting location on the map.

698
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,710
Scott: That's not on land because you're a fucking submarine.

699
00:41:30,871 --> 00:41:32,865
Rym: Yeah, so both sides you're looking at this just map.

700
00:41:33,208 --> 00:41:35,378
Scott: then You have on each team.

701
00:41:35,539 --> 00:41:36,262
Scott: You have the captain.

702
00:41:36,383 --> 00:41:45,532
Scott: the captain says head North or head east or head south or head west because the grid and the captain said when you move you have to say it Loud.

703
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:49,245
Scott: so everyone hears right your team and the other team.

704
00:41:49,265 --> 00:41:53,867
Scott: So the person on the other team They don't know where you started, but they know you just headed north.

705
00:41:53,927 --> 00:41:56,542
Scott: So on there There's a radio operator and the radio operator.

706
00:41:56,562 --> 00:41:56,883
Scott: This is that.

707
00:41:56,904 --> 00:41:58,070
Rym: this is what really makes the game.

708
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:08,170
Scott: this is really the radio operators only job is to listen to the opponent's captain and Draw a line north because he headed north and then draw a line east when they head east so they know the path you took.

709
00:42:08,552 --> 00:42:11,125
Rym: So the radio operator is trying to figure out where the other sub is.

710
00:42:11,165 --> 00:42:14,239
Rym: based on all this information they're overhearing right and they're on.

711
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:19,645
Rym: all they do is solve the puzzle or figure it out and Give the basically consult with the captain and be like captain.

712
00:42:19,665 --> 00:42:20,630
Rym: They're either here or here captain.

713
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:25,341
Rym: I think they're going this way and the captain is Synthesizing their information like Scott.

714
00:42:25,361 --> 00:42:26,045
Rym: Where do you think they are?

715
00:42:26,125 --> 00:42:26,829
Rym: I'm gonna start heading north.

716
00:42:26,869 --> 00:42:31,870
Rym: Cool Yeah, and you're also working with engineering and all the other people talk about those people in a second.

717
00:42:32,392 --> 00:42:35,280
Scott: But the radio operator has a transparency and a map.

718
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:38,630
Scott: the captain has a map that there's a drawing on where they really literally are.

719
00:42:38,791 --> 00:42:39,897
Rym: You can play as fast as you want.

720
00:42:39,937 --> 00:42:42,330
Rym: I could be like head north head north head north head north head north.

721
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:43,193
Rym: That's okay.

722
00:42:43,213 --> 00:42:48,068
Scott: Well, you can't necessarily do that either because you can until no you can't.

723
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:51,934
Scott: so anyway the Radio opera.

724
00:42:51,974 --> 00:42:52,858
Scott: I played this game recently.

725
00:42:52,878 --> 00:42:54,125
Scott: Let me explain it cuz you don't know.

726
00:42:54,165 --> 00:42:54,507
Scott: you don't know.

727
00:42:54,527 --> 00:42:55,130
Scott: I read the rules.

728
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:57,090
Scott: You didn't read the rule book actually did read the rules.

729
00:42:57,270 --> 00:43:02,844
Scott: Okay, anyway the radio operator has a transparency and a map that it moved the transparency around.

730
00:43:03,225 --> 00:43:06,254
Scott: you also can't move and bump Into your own trail.

731
00:43:06,314 --> 00:43:07,057
Scott: It's like Tron.

732
00:43:07,439 --> 00:43:08,403
Scott: You can't hear your motor.

733
00:43:08,423 --> 00:43:10,190
Scott: So your submarine has a laser coming out the back.

734
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:11,094
Scott: That's creating a wall.

735
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,823
Scott: Yeah cannot bump into your own wall.

736
00:43:12,843 --> 00:43:15,517
Scott: You can bump into the other team's wall Yeah, because you don't even know.

737
00:43:15,557 --> 00:43:16,422
Scott: you don't even know where it is.

738
00:43:16,442 --> 00:43:17,990
Rym: Yeah bump into the wall can't bump in the land.

739
00:43:18,071 --> 00:43:21,110
Scott: You can't go like you can't go east southwest north.

740
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:26,590
Scott: That's an illegal move because you just bumped into yourself right your trail and you can surface and make it go away.

741
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:28,099
Scott: But whatever that's not important.

742
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:29,084
Rym: servicing is super fun.

743
00:43:29,105 --> 00:43:30,030
Rym: We'll talk about that a bit.

744
00:43:30,131 --> 00:43:32,307
Scott: So then you've got the first mate.

745
00:43:32,509 --> 00:43:35,501
Scott: now if you only have three on three the captain is also the first mate.

746
00:43:35,541 --> 00:43:36,464
Scott: and what the first mate does?

747
00:43:36,565 --> 00:43:43,590
Scott: every time they move they Charge a system and a little bit and they can charge all these different systems that do different things.

748
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:48,029
Scott: There's the sonar and drone systems which you can use to help find the opponent sub.

749
00:43:48,049 --> 00:43:59,270
Scott: Yep There's the silent running system the silent system which lets you move secretly As a number of spaces for in any of the four directions except for backwards because you that you'll bump into your own trail.

750
00:43:59,471 --> 00:44:05,490
Scott: Yeah, and there's the weapon systems the mine and the torpedo which you can charge up and there's an optional six thing for like.

751
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:06,093
Rym: That's only.

752
00:44:06,294 --> 00:44:07,822
Scott: no that's only on map five.

753
00:44:07,983 --> 00:44:08,184
Rym: Yep.

754
00:44:08,225 --> 00:44:09,210
Scott: That's the hardest map.

755
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:10,194
Scott: There's the scenario.

756
00:44:10,255 --> 00:44:13,710
Scott: thing that you charge up and use it does something special, but what we didn't enter played with it.

757
00:44:13,871 --> 00:44:18,409
Rym: So I already read online a lot of people once they played the game a lot They make up their own thing.

758
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:24,034
Rym: You have to make up your own map because but basically you that's the spot where you can charge up something weird If you made a custom scenario.

759
00:44:24,115 --> 00:44:27,050
Scott: also the map one is the only map I've played on and it's a baby map.

760
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:28,849
Scott: We gotta gotta go to map B real quick.

761
00:44:29,057 --> 00:44:36,048
Scott: Yeah Once you once you know how to play anyway the the final person is the engineer and the engineer has this picture of the submarine kind of.

762
00:44:36,529 --> 00:44:43,302
Scott: and There's a main circuit and there's a nuclear reactor and every time you move There's they have to cross off something on this sheet.

763
00:44:43,383 --> 00:44:45,070
Rym: Yeah shit breaks every time you move.

764
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:51,990
Scott: So if you move north they have to pick something in the north Rectangle and remove it either something in the reactor or something in the main circuit.

765
00:44:52,552 --> 00:44:55,683
Scott: And now let's say they remove like the weapon system in the North's area.

766
00:44:56,064 --> 00:45:05,630
Rym: Well, you can't use your weapon systems Yep, so you get into situations where if the captain's not paying attention I'll be like halt fire torpedo and they're like, nope Not some of the things in the main circuit are connected to each other.

767
00:45:06,092 --> 00:45:10,354
Scott: So if you hit all four things that are connected to each other by a line They all clear.

768
00:45:10,434 --> 00:45:14,050
Scott: so you can go north north northeast and those are all connected to each other.

769
00:45:14,431 --> 00:45:19,250
Scott: So if you do north north northeast those all then get erased and now you're good to use some sort of equipment.

770
00:45:19,512 --> 00:45:21,569
Scott: All right, one of the things that the first mate is charging up.

771
00:45:22,252 --> 00:45:28,800
Scott: You can also clear off your reactor things, but those are permanently removed Until you surface.

772
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,110
Scott: so good luck with that.

773
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:37,414
Scott: And if you fuck up your sub if you exam if you cross off every less your north area on your little sheet only has So many circle bits.

774
00:45:37,835 --> 00:45:43,696
Scott: if you cross all of them off a hundred percent you take damage and your submarine only has four hit points And can ever be healed.

775
00:45:43,897 --> 00:45:45,910
Rym: and the best part is the captain just gives orders.

776
00:45:46,031 --> 00:45:51,670
Rym: so if the captain says go north like once you say it and The second is yeah.

777
00:45:52,171 --> 00:46:00,883
Scott: After the captain says north southeast or west both of the people next to him the engineer and the first mate have to say, okay Yeah, if they don't say, okay, you didn't move yet.

778
00:46:00,943 --> 00:46:01,345
Scott: Really?

779
00:46:01,365 --> 00:46:06,230
Scott: Yep, and If they don't say, okay, you can't move again yet, right?

780
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:11,831
Scott: So you feel like head north and you don't hear two okays then you didn't really move north and you'd not have to discuss with Them.

781
00:46:11,871 --> 00:46:13,719
Scott: Why didn't we move north engineer?

782
00:46:13,739 --> 00:46:15,145
Scott: Yeah engines busted.

783
00:46:15,185 --> 00:46:17,415
Scott: We can't move noise Here.

784
00:46:17,435 --> 00:46:18,204
Rym: she blew us up.

785
00:46:18,528 --> 00:46:19,833
Scott: Yeah We got it.

786
00:46:19,873 --> 00:46:21,140
Scott: We can only move this direction.

787
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:28,338
Rym: Oh, so you get a lot of chatter Like I was the captain in the one game I played and I kept yelling engineering like hey How much leeway do I have in the east?

788
00:46:28,379 --> 00:46:29,787
Rym: and they'd be like not a lot.

789
00:46:29,827 --> 00:46:33,968
Rym: captain What do you need me to do to heal stuff to go like this?

790
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:40,815
Rym: I'm looking at where Scott's telling me to go and I'm looking at where engineering is telling me to go The opposite directions.

791
00:46:40,956 --> 00:46:44,350
Scott: so every time I played I mean I'm gonna go through all the rules of exactly how everything works.

792
00:46:44,451 --> 00:46:47,210
Scott: But the every time I played this so far were just three times.

793
00:46:47,611 --> 00:46:53,930
Scott: It's everyone sort of used the same strategy, which I now only at the end of the third game I realized might not be the best strategy.

794
00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:57,770
Rym: I'm curious what you're gonna say there because I came up with what I think is a decent strategy.

795
00:46:57,770 --> 00:47:02,970
Scott: But also your strategies are different because on map a it's really easy to figure out where people are because there's so many islands.

796
00:47:03,151 --> 00:47:05,300
Scott: Yeah on the harder maps is a lot less islands.

797
00:47:05,581 --> 00:47:06,324
Scott: It's a lot harder to.

798
00:47:06,565 --> 00:47:07,690
Scott: they could be anywhere, right?

799
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:14,530
Scott: But basically we were playing such that we're moving fast as fast as we could because moving is the only way to charge stuff.

800
00:47:14,570 --> 00:47:20,810
Scott: Uh, right charging all kinds of stuff up and then trying to use the sonar and drone systems to find the opponent.

801
00:47:21,132 --> 00:47:23,789
Scott: We found them easily because the map has a lot of islands on it.

802
00:47:24,011 --> 00:47:25,441
Scott: Yep, and they were moving a lot.

803
00:47:25,462 --> 00:47:29,990
Scott: when someone moves a lot It's easy to find them because they have a big old trail that only fits in certain places on the map.

804
00:47:30,131 --> 00:47:30,858
Scott: They had a little trail.

805
00:47:31,221 --> 00:47:31,463
Scott: It's hard.

806
00:47:31,504 --> 00:47:32,150
Scott: It could be anywhere.

807
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:32,752
Rym: Well, it's funny.

808
00:47:32,813 --> 00:47:38,015
Rym: we both in the first game both subs kind of went near each other and try to put mines and basically the Same place.

809
00:47:38,035 --> 00:47:41,070
Scott: Yeah, but mines don't set off when someone goes near them.

810
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:43,437
Scott: They set off remote their remote triggered mines.

811
00:47:43,498 --> 00:47:44,601
Rym: the heck have to raise his hand.

812
00:47:44,641 --> 00:47:47,450
Rym: is like we're detonating the mine at this location.

813
00:47:47,571 --> 00:47:47,812
Scott: Are you?

814
00:47:47,973 --> 00:47:48,636
Scott: are you near it?

815
00:47:48,736 --> 00:47:51,409
Scott: Yeah, we're near it shit or oh, no, we're nowhere near there.

816
00:47:51,671 --> 00:47:54,770
Rym: Yeah, and if you detonate it near yourself, well, yeah, you can hurt yourself anyway.

817
00:47:56,491 --> 00:48:04,501
Scott: So yeah, so we everyone moved fast found each other quickly and then it was free was just a race to see who could shoot the other Submarine with torpedoes first.

818
00:48:04,702 --> 00:48:06,272
Scott: and I've won all three games I played.

819
00:48:06,954 --> 00:48:11,610
Scott: but I think a better move is to move a little bit charge up some stuff and then just silent to sit there.

820
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:12,216
Rym: Yeah, put

821
00:48:12,297 --> 00:48:28,050
Scott: mines out, you know Make sure these move slowly so they can't find you, you know use silence a lot like drop a mine silence drop a mine Silence and move a little bit and be really mysterious and stealthy and then like surface because they have no clue where you are.

822
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:29,537
Scott: So you can surface safely.

823
00:48:29,878 --> 00:48:32,209
Scott: when you surface they know what sector you're in.

824
00:48:32,611 --> 00:48:35,950
Scott: And then right after you're done surfacing silence move, right?

825
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:42,410
Scott: They can't you know and leave so many mines around right and then the radio operator will be like captain.

826
00:48:42,932 --> 00:48:47,190
Scott: I think they're near one of our mines and set it off and this way you can't really get torpedoed.

827
00:48:47,513 --> 00:48:52,450
Scott: It's hard for them to find you Right and you just make yours your sub harder to find than their sub.

828
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:56,030
Scott: But then even if they do the same thing as you you just had to do it better.

829
00:48:56,271 --> 00:49:01,300
Rym: But then you do run the risk because if you're moving more slowly Meaning you have more time to consult and like come up with the strategy.

830
00:49:01,761 --> 00:49:03,870
Rym: The other sub has the exact same opportunity now.

831
00:49:03,930 --> 00:49:06,815
Rym: Yeah If you suddenly start moving fast They got to keep up.

832
00:49:06,855 --> 00:49:11,458
Rym: like if you're the radio operator and you like you flub it or you fuck it up Your subs in a lot of trouble.

833
00:49:11,498 --> 00:49:17,230
Scott: now, maybe maybe not, you know Even if you fuck up a little bit Usually you can get still really figure out where they are.

834
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:19,877
Rym: There's one mechanic that I think is super fun.

835
00:49:20,037 --> 00:49:24,910
Rym: where if you surface the there's a task you have to do the rule for yourself.

836
00:49:25,031 --> 00:49:26,302
Rym: Alright, this is cool.

837
00:49:26,503 --> 00:49:27,229
Rym: pencils down.

838
00:49:27,542 --> 00:49:27,710
Scott: Yeah.

839
00:49:27,791 --> 00:49:34,350
Rym: So if Scott's the radio operator and I surface is the captain The other subs moving and Scott's not allowed to write anything down.

840
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:36,060
Scott: I thought you are allowed to keep tracking.

841
00:49:36,321 --> 00:49:37,830
Rym: you can listen to it, but his pencils down.

842
00:49:38,112 --> 00:49:39,625
Scott: I didn't read that in the rule book.

843
00:49:39,645 --> 00:49:43,070
Rym: That's how the Facilitator who taught us the game was very specific.

844
00:49:43,532 --> 00:49:47,770
Rym: Everyone has to put their pencil down until everyone completes their task.

845
00:49:48,111 --> 00:49:48,613
Scott: I don't remember.

846
00:49:48,734 --> 00:49:52,590
Scott: I've never put my pencil down while the except for while doing the thing anyway.

847
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:56,021
Scott: so when you surface the engineer takes on their sheet.

848
00:49:56,061 --> 00:50:05,670
Scott: at the top is a picture of a submarine with four sections and That each section has a white outline and you have to draw in that white outline without touching the edges without touching the edges.

849
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:12,390
Scott: sort of like You know one of those games where you have like a metal ring on a stick and you're trying to move it around the wire Without touching the wire.

850
00:50:12,452 --> 00:50:16,465
Scott: Yeah And then you initial it and your whole team has to initial a section each.

851
00:50:16,766 --> 00:50:21,510
Scott: if you have three players Someone does two sections then you show this to the enemy engineer.

852
00:50:21,912 --> 00:50:25,189
Scott: They look at it and verify it that you did it properly without messing up.

853
00:50:25,755 --> 00:50:34,289
Scott: And if they say you did a good job Because they shouldn't be assholes and say you did a bad job when you didn't actually mess up Then they say okay, and now you can say dive and play again

854
00:50:34,590 --> 00:50:38,525
Rym: Yep, but the other sub can keep doing stuff while you finish unless

855
00:50:38,586 --> 00:50:39,730
Scott: they're also trying to surface.

856
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:44,930
Scott: But yeah, and they know it's second announce what sector you're servicing in but you don't announce your exact location.

857
00:50:44,991 --> 00:50:45,968
Scott: So it's not like you're just dead.

858
00:50:46,971 --> 00:50:50,130
Scott: Plus you hopefully do this when they're far away and can't really do anything to you.

859
00:50:50,290 --> 00:50:50,692
Rym: Observe it.

860
00:50:50,732 --> 00:50:54,449
Rym: like in the first game we played the other sub was forced to surface because they had a bunch of breakdowns.

861
00:50:54,570 --> 00:50:55,235
Scott: Well, it's like they can't.

862
00:50:55,275 --> 00:50:57,390
Scott: you can't go back on your snake, right?

863
00:50:57,630 --> 00:51:02,190
Scott: So let's say for example you go like south east south west.

864
00:51:03,192 --> 00:51:06,330
Scott: Now you can't go north and you can't go east and maybe there's an island to your south.

865
00:51:06,370 --> 00:51:09,461
Scott: You can only go west again, but maybe you're out of West's.

866
00:51:09,662 --> 00:51:12,951
Scott: So your choice is to go west and damage yourself or Surface.

867
00:51:13,373 --> 00:51:15,021
Scott: all right, and maybe you already have three damage.

868
00:51:15,041 --> 00:51:16,427
Scott: You can't go west and damage yourself.

869
00:51:16,447 --> 00:51:19,879
Rym: You have to serve Cannot use their pens for anything.

870
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:20,542
Scott: That's new.

871
00:51:20,602 --> 00:51:20,964
Scott: That's new.

872
00:51:21,225 --> 00:51:25,141
Rym: Okay, so So when I played it the first time what cuz?

873
00:51:25,181 --> 00:51:27,150
Rym: yeah, you were doing the radio operators cuz I kept it.

874
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:28,857
Scott: I kept radio operating when we were certain.

875
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:30,042
Scott: Oh, you're cheating then.

876
00:51:30,062 --> 00:51:31,870
Scott: Oh, no, wait, we didn't surface ever.

877
00:51:31,971 --> 00:51:33,110
Rym: Yeah, we never surface or fine.

878
00:51:33,393 --> 00:51:42,058
Rym: But yesterday when we played yeah So they surface and I looked at my engineer because they played the game a bunch already And I was like should we go for it?

879
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:44,430
Rym: and they were like go and I was like North North East.

880
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:47,165
Scott: We're just like moved as fast to charge it to our Peter.

881
00:51:47,185 --> 00:51:48,190
Scott: You only needed three movements.

882
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,338
Scott: So we went move move move.

883
00:51:49,358 --> 00:51:50,346
Scott: Shoot move move.

884
00:51:50,366 --> 00:51:50,849
Scott: Shoot done.

885
00:51:51,412 --> 00:51:55,447
Scott: If you knew the whole it only hurt them because we knew exactly the spot they were on.

886
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:56,270
Scott: we had shot them.

887
00:51:56,692 --> 00:51:57,819
Scott: Then they started servicing.

888
00:51:57,839 --> 00:51:59,589
Scott: then we just went move move move shoot and they were dead.

889
00:51:59,831 --> 00:52:01,061
Rym: Yeah, we moved as fast as we could.

890
00:52:01,162 --> 00:52:02,150
Scott: they didn't want to serve us.

891
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:02,855
Scott: He just had no choice.

892
00:52:02,875 --> 00:52:04,546
Scott: you want to serve us when no one can know where you are.

893
00:52:04,707 --> 00:52:10,650
Rym: Yep Exactly, so if the other ones also surfaced then I guess you can get away with it for a little while.

894
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:11,353
Scott: I think they really.

895
00:52:11,414 --> 00:52:14,710
Scott: the only flaw in this game is that I think it can be fucked up.

896
00:52:15,051 --> 00:52:20,229
Scott: You can get it messed up if like you can't you know, there's some sort of miscommunications or right?

897
00:52:20,650 --> 00:52:23,770
Scott: Because no one's like watching you and verifying you only charge the right number.

898
00:52:23,831 --> 00:52:31,949
Rym: It's like you could just cheat But a clever person would notice right and the game really requires everyone to be in the spirit of let's not cheat.

899
00:52:31,989 --> 00:52:37,990
Scott: guys You know, you can't like just saying no when they drew the outline properly, yeah stuff like that, you know.

900
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:41,050
Scott: But it's like if you're going fast, there's a lot of opportunity for mistakes.

901
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:45,690
Rym: You'd need a lot of discipline and I think the way I would get around that is irrespective of how the rules are actually written.

902
00:52:46,072 --> 00:52:51,994
Rym: When I teach it to people I'm gonna come I'm gonna use a very specific lexicon and require it of everyone Just to make it clear.

903
00:52:52,014 --> 00:52:55,912
Rym: and I think it's something like when the cabin wants to move they have to say like set a course North.

904
00:52:55,992 --> 00:52:57,278
Scott: no, it actually says in the rule book.

905
00:52:57,298 --> 00:52:59,065
Scott: You have to say head north head north.

906
00:52:59,106 --> 00:53:00,090
Scott: That's what it says in the rule book.

907
00:53:00,312 --> 00:53:01,709
Rym: Yeah, I'm saying you must say it.

908
00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:02,416
Rym: I think head is enough.

909
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:07,184
Scott: You just don't say it more than once and the other people have to see.

910
00:53:07,204 --> 00:53:08,710
Scott: the rule book is very explicit about this.

911
00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:10,959
Scott: We just weren't told that the one time we played at PAX.

912
00:53:11,301 --> 00:53:12,465
Scott: I read the rule book yesterday.

913
00:53:12,767 --> 00:53:13,570
Scott: It's very explicit.

914
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:16,790
Scott: You must say head north if you just say north then it doesn't mean shit.

915
00:53:16,951 --> 00:53:21,718
Scott: You have to say head north and your engineer and first mate have to say, okay Otherwise, you didn't move anywhere.

916
00:53:21,739 --> 00:53:23,790
Scott: All right, that's super explicit.

917
00:53:23,871 --> 00:53:24,781
Scott: You don't need to know what.

918
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:31,732
Rym: he also said To me after we were talking about the game because actually I told him my idea of say set a course instead and he said That's way better.

919
00:53:32,033 --> 00:53:35,063
Rym: because he said that they ran into that problem a lot.

920
00:53:35,304 --> 00:53:39,789
Scott: Yeah, because they didn't tell people to say head They said well now we were just playing like North North East.

921
00:53:40,191 --> 00:53:44,610
Rym: No, he said it was any problem with that partly because a lot of the people who played were kind of mumbling nerds.

922
00:53:44,914 --> 00:53:45,830
Scott: That's also a problem.

923
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:47,738
Scott: You have to be loud and clear.

924
00:53:47,758 --> 00:53:50,770
Rym: but the other suggestion that he had that he said worked really well.

925
00:53:51,031 --> 00:53:55,090
Rym: If you didn't want to make it a longer phrase to make it very explicit was have a rule.

926
00:53:55,311 --> 00:53:56,173
Rym: Does that tell the group?

927
00:53:56,574 --> 00:54:01,810
Rym: the captain has to look at the radio operator and like point at them or make some gesture when they?

928
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:02,252
Rym: Say it.

929
00:54:02,413 --> 00:54:04,730
Scott: Yeah, you know something whatever you can do, right?

930
00:54:05,071 --> 00:54:06,197
Rym: It doesn't really matter.

931
00:54:06,358 --> 00:54:10,979
Rym: and just be as long as you're a hundred percent consistent Then the other team has no excuse.

932
00:54:10,999 --> 00:54:13,510
Scott: it effectively doesn't matter but the rule book isn't flawed.

933
00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:14,710
Scott: The rule book is not enough list.

934
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:24,530
Scott: so the rule book is fine and you know just had to be absolutely clear when you move and Versus when someone is just like saying the word north for some other reason because they're discussing where should we?

935
00:54:25,092 --> 00:54:25,956
Scott: Like should we move west?

936
00:54:25,976 --> 00:54:29,330
Scott: Yeah, I think we should move west if the other team accidentally thinks you moved west.

937
00:54:29,771 --> 00:54:33,646
Rym: No, another guy I was talking to in the room after we played the first time.

938
00:54:34,107 --> 00:54:34,850
Rym: they were at packs.

939
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:35,332
Rym: they were.

940
00:54:35,573 --> 00:54:43,550
Rym: they were talking to how in a previous game the other sub stop moving and The captain started talking to the radio operator about a plan.

941
00:54:44,173 --> 00:54:47,150
Rym: So he just jotted down their plan because he was listening as the radio operator.

942
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:47,512
Rym: I know.

943
00:54:47,532 --> 00:54:50,650
Scott: see I mean so that's when you play the game the first few times, right?

944
00:54:50,650 --> 00:54:53,563
Scott: You're playing a busy baby mode, but you're not actually playing baby mode.

945
00:54:53,603 --> 00:54:55,030
Scott: rules other than the other than the math.

946
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:56,636
Rym: Yeah, don't play the baby actual baby mode.

947
00:54:56,696 --> 00:54:59,004
Rym: Everyone says it's the turn-based mode doesn't exist.

948
00:54:59,225 --> 00:55:00,750
Scott: Yeah, don't look on the other side of your map.

949
00:55:02,331 --> 00:55:16,450
Scott: It's like that CD in D&D third edition when it came out when we played Basically, if the radio operators like got something wrong on the path We would stop and like have the captain like reiterate the path they took so that they could correct the radio operators map.

950
00:55:17,132 --> 00:55:22,111
Scott: But in reality when you play this game for serious with eight people who know what they're doing you don't do that shit Right.

951
00:55:22,131 --> 00:55:26,830
Scott: The radio operator is your role-playing the existence of like a real radio.

952
00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:27,716
Scott: You're under stress.

953
00:55:27,736 --> 00:55:31,918
Rym: if the other team's moving fast and the captain's yelling at you You're like miss an order and well that sucks right.

954
00:55:31,938 --> 00:55:34,570
Scott: like so, you know a radio isn't always loud and clear, right?

955
00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:41,716
Scott: You might not know, you know get everything coming in clearly right when you put your pencil down to surface You might not remember everything.

956
00:55:41,736 --> 00:55:49,661
Scott: So you're you know, you have to find them despite the radio not being perfect Yeah, and that aspect of it actually the radio operator.

957
00:55:49,822 --> 00:55:52,630
Scott: we have to find a balance between it's bullshit.

958
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:53,754
Scott: You were being quiet.

959
00:55:53,794 --> 00:55:54,858
Scott: We couldn't hear you.

960
00:55:55,099 --> 00:55:57,166
Scott: You're just trying to scam the radio operator.

961
00:55:57,427 --> 00:56:01,130
Scott: and no We actually don't want this to absolutely be perfect.

962
00:56:01,271 --> 00:56:05,110
Scott: Which is there should be some noise on and interference on the radio jamming and whatnot.

963
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:14,150
Rym: but it's easily solved by just following the rules explicitly and you know loud and clear voice and use the Specific terminology that is required of you for your role.

964
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:19,187
Scott: The flaw in this game is it's hard to get eight competent people in one place who are dedicated.

965
00:56:19,247 --> 00:56:20,913
Scott: and well if you get those Eight people.

966
00:56:20,933 --> 00:56:22,398
Scott: Why are you playing a tabletop RPG?

967
00:56:22,458 --> 00:56:24,024
Rym: You can get away with well one.

968
00:56:24,044 --> 00:56:27,670
Rym: this takes way less time than tabletop It does and it takes less preparation.

969
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:30,660
Scott: But and you still need eight quality the four rolls, right?

970
00:56:31,021 --> 00:56:33,830
Rym: The radio operator is the hardest and the most stressful.

971
00:56:33,911 --> 00:56:34,828
Scott: They can't do anything else.

972
00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:39,442
Rym: Yeah, the captain is the second hardest because you might just kill everybody like.

973
00:56:39,522 --> 00:56:41,046
Rym: it's your fault if you mess up.

974
00:56:41,688 --> 00:56:44,049
Rym: the other two roles Are way easier.

975
00:56:44,896 --> 00:56:45,468
Rym: They're still fun.

976
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:45,911
Rym: They're like.

977
00:56:45,952 --> 00:56:47,719
Rym: they're not like the game is set up to where.

978
00:56:47,739 --> 00:56:53,149
Scott: let's say you played a bunch of first mate is definitely the easiest job Because all the first mate does is basically charge up systems.

979
00:56:53,712 --> 00:56:54,877
Scott: But the first mate.

980
00:56:54,997 --> 00:57:00,810
Scott: I think the reason that the first mate exists and has such a simple job Is that they can do a lot of the thinking right?

981
00:57:01,474 --> 00:57:02,881
Scott: It's part of the role-playing part.

982
00:57:02,901 --> 00:57:07,750
Rym: is you know of actually being in a submarine Captain where mines are charged to place them somewhere, right?

983
00:57:07,850 --> 00:57:20,823
Scott: The first mate advises the captain and like thinks, you know Cuz you need the captain is so harried dealing with all this shit coming right at them that you need that one job That's light so that that person can sort of you know help with.

984
00:57:20,944 --> 00:57:21,747
Scott: you know, what's going on?

985
00:57:21,787 --> 00:57:29,290
Rym: fact in our game our my first mate was actually Consulting with engineering and then he was actually talking to me.

986
00:57:29,350 --> 00:57:33,248
Rym: So engineering didn't talk to me except when I gave all you know, go ahead north.

987
00:57:33,329 --> 00:57:33,610
Rym: Okay?

988
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:37,750
Rym: Yeah, because otherwise he was dealing with his own shit of trying to figure out a course.

989
00:57:38,131 --> 00:57:42,487
Rym: So they would like they worked out a system with it, but since this game is real time.

990
00:57:42,507 --> 00:57:47,498
Scott: There is no Requirement whatsoever for the pace at which you move.

991
00:57:47,538 --> 00:57:53,900
Scott: you could just not move and just like get up get with your team and put Your heads together and huddle and discuss things for like minutes if you

992
00:57:53,981 --> 00:57:56,811
Rym: want and then suddenly the like you see both subs are quietly I

993
00:57:57,414 --> 00:57:57,655
Scott: mean your

994
00:57:57,715 --> 00:58:00,648
Rym: mid one subs like head north and then all shit breaks out,

995
00:58:00,909 --> 00:58:01,130
Scott: right?

996
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:02,709
Scott: It's like suddenly you have to pay attention to them.

997
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:10,326
Scott: Yeah Like you might just be quietly discussing things and not even moving and then the other team is like stop Because whenever you use an ability you have to stop the game.

998
00:58:10,366 --> 00:58:11,010
Rym: I think you say halt.

999
00:58:11,231 --> 00:58:12,655
Scott: Yeah, you say stop halt whatever.

1000
00:58:12,695 --> 00:58:13,518
Scott: and then they're like stop.

1001
00:58:13,759 --> 00:58:18,368
Scott: We're firing a torpedo at i9 and it's like oh Shit, how did you know?

1002
00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:20,168
Scott: How did you know?

1003
00:58:21,391 --> 00:58:27,390
Rym: But because there's there's sort of four levels of roles two stressful ones and two much less stress like way less stressful.

1004
00:58:27,531 --> 00:58:29,226
Scott: The engineering one is slightly stressful.

1005
00:58:29,287 --> 00:58:32,427
Rym: Yeah Well, especially because the captain might not listen to you.

1006
00:58:32,447 --> 00:58:33,934
Rym: if you're like captain We can't go east anymore.

1007
00:58:33,974 --> 00:58:35,401
Rym: Yeah, the captain is like head east again.

1008
00:58:35,421 --> 00:58:37,470
Scott: You're like, well, the first mate is the easy job.

1009
00:58:37,671 --> 00:58:41,780
Rym: Yeah, but it's good because say you play the game three times in a row Like you're out of your like hanging out.

1010
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,230
Scott: change change up the roles change.

1011
00:58:43,350 --> 00:58:48,089
Rym: Yeah, cuz after if you do the captain and then the radio operator your brain needs a break.

1012
00:58:48,592 --> 00:58:50,561
Rym: Game is like I'm not kidding.

1013
00:58:50,662 --> 00:58:52,390
Scott: You don't want to be a radio operator again.

1014
00:58:52,571 --> 00:58:53,960
Scott: You know want to go be the first mate.

1015
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:55,650
Rym: I would not want to be the captain two times in a row.

1016
00:58:55,650 --> 00:58:57,046
Rym: That shit is real hard.

1017
00:58:57,086 --> 00:59:08,291
Scott: Yep yeah, if you got if you're the kind of person who plays tabletop games has a big enough table and Has eight people this is a must-buy game even at the retail price of $50.

1018
00:59:08,291 --> 00:59:13,430
Scott: If you are a gaming tabletop gaming convention, you are a convention or a library of games.

1019
00:59:13,511 --> 00:59:15,609
Scott: This is a must-get game in your library.

1020
00:59:16,053 --> 00:59:18,690
Scott: If you're if you go to meetups, right, you know, it must get games.

1021
00:59:18,811 --> 00:59:21,670
Rym: This is a game where I think most people will only experience it at conventions.

1022
00:59:21,730 --> 00:59:25,243
Rym: Like you go to PAX someone comes over to the table and says hey, we're playing this.

1023
00:59:25,263 --> 00:59:27,010
Rym: I got it from the library.

1024
00:59:27,150 --> 00:59:33,990
Scott: Yep, I'd like to play it like, you know and more harder maps and you know what I like to see this time on it.

1025
00:59:34,050 --> 00:59:38,670
Rym: This should be the first round of the megathon finale of packs or the megathon at PAX East.

1026
00:59:39,004 --> 00:59:46,036
Scott: Yeah you could have a bunch of games and just all the winning teams continue all the losing because you can divide any multiple of people in half by using this game

1027
00:59:46,136 --> 00:59:51,878
Rym: and because the game mechanics are so streamlined and simple the game is right for modding like if you Play this game to the point that like

1028
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:52,502
Scott: you've

1029
00:59:52,542 --> 00:59:58,023
Rym: all memorized the engineering So, you know movement patterns to clear stuff and you're like super a game.

1030
00:59:58,505 --> 01:00:00,950
Rym: just modify it because it doesn't matter It's not like it's secret.

1031
01:00:01,251 --> 01:00:03,520
Rym: You just both teams agree like let's make up a mod.

1032
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:06,655
Rym: you make a mod you do something with the scenario and then you just Play that man.

1033
01:00:06,675 --> 01:00:07,966
Scott: I mean you just make new maps.

1034
01:00:08,026 --> 01:00:08,430
Scott: really in that.

1035
01:00:08,470 --> 01:00:12,310
Scott: Yeah, that makes it exciting enough just changing the map like make a map where there's a nuke or something.

1036
01:00:12,852 --> 01:00:13,897
Scott: You can make a bigger map.

1037
01:00:13,957 --> 01:00:15,765
Scott: you could make a smaller map.

1038
01:00:15,805 --> 01:00:18,073
Scott: you could make you know Something else.

1039
01:00:18,113 --> 01:00:18,996
Rym: you can even use.

1040
01:00:19,016 --> 01:00:22,890
Rym: this say you're if you were playing like a naval RPG or some nonsense.

1041
01:00:22,931 --> 01:00:23,488
Scott: There's a map.

1042
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:32,085
Scott: There's a map that comes with it that where all the water is ice and you can only surface in certain parts And if you surface under the ice and smash into it you take damage.

1043
01:00:32,146 --> 01:00:37,579
Scott: Yeah, right It's like you just come up with something like that Like oh there's a you know, everyone has a boat.

1044
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:38,041
Scott: that also.

1045
01:00:38,061 --> 01:00:39,024
Scott: but you can just go crazy.

1046
01:00:39,224 --> 01:00:41,110
Rym: or you've both got intelligence.

1047
01:00:41,291 --> 01:00:43,780
Rym: You've got to get to a port on the opposite side.

1048
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:44,944
Scott: Yeah, sure, whatever.

1049
01:00:44,964 --> 01:00:46,469
Scott: Yeah, but that would be you can't?

1050
01:00:46,690 --> 01:00:49,270
Scott: I don't think you have a victory condition besides finding the other sub.

1051
01:00:49,772 --> 01:00:53,629
Scott: Yeah, I think you could and you just go to the other side and wind like our game over now.

1052
01:00:54,031 --> 01:00:55,349
Rym: But maybe yeah, so I know they're doing that.

1053
01:00:55,410 --> 01:00:58,890
Rym: So I go over to the other side like there's one port on the square and I put a mine.

1054
01:00:58,910 --> 01:00:59,373
Scott: How do you know?

1055
01:00:59,393 --> 01:00:59,473
Scott: Yeah.

1056
01:00:59,494 --> 01:01:00,661
Scott: Well, how do you know when they're there?

1057
01:01:00,741 --> 01:01:02,230
Scott: It's like, you know, well, I hear I'm moving.

1058
01:01:03,152 --> 01:01:04,359
Scott: One mine doesn't kill him either.

1059
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:05,426
Rym: Yeah, I'm there too.

1060
01:01:05,466 --> 01:01:06,050
Rym: Well, I'm gonna wait.

1061
01:01:06,734 --> 01:01:07,721
Scott: I think you have to always.

1062
01:01:07,741 --> 01:01:08,869
Scott: the objective always has to be.

1063
01:01:10,554 --> 01:01:12,458
Rym: There are ways to play this game.

1064
01:01:12,659 --> 01:01:17,090
Rym: once you've played it out you can just mod it forever because it's gonna have expansions for sure.

1065
01:01:17,350 --> 01:01:19,718
Scott: Yeah, the expansion is gonna come with like more boards.

1066
01:01:19,959 --> 01:01:22,587
Scott: Yeah, like replacement boards and all sorts of stuff.

1067
01:01:22,848 --> 01:01:23,570
Scott: It's definitely coming.

1068
01:01:23,831 --> 01:01:27,590
Rym: This was probably the most surprising game to me at all effects.

1069
01:01:27,590 --> 01:01:27,690
Rym: The

1070
01:01:27,730 --> 01:01:45,063
Scott: thing is you're spending 50 bucks though for a bunch of cardboard boards that are really thin and you can dry erase on them to transparency sheets Some thick boards that just have sort of artwork on them that used to separate your team from the other team Yep, and a pile of crappy dry erase markers that the racers built in.

1071
01:01:45,103 --> 01:01:47,290
Scott: that are really shitty, but they get the job done.

1072
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:48,776
Scott: That's all you're getting in and the rule book.

1073
01:01:48,796 --> 01:01:49,781
Scott: That's all you're getting.

1074
01:01:50,162 --> 01:01:55,443
Rym: You're not getting anything else in this box Which like I said, I'm fine with in this case.

1075
01:01:55,503 --> 01:01:57,410
Scott: It's a really big box to rebox this shit.

1076
01:01:57,531 --> 01:02:00,330
Rym: Yeah, well the funny thing is this packs for whatever reason it PAX West.

1077
01:02:00,430 --> 01:02:04,830
Rym: We played a lot of co-op II games and a lot of shared space games like way more than ever.

1078
01:02:05,251 --> 01:02:07,801
Rym: This was one of many and we'll be talking about him.

1079
01:02:07,841 --> 01:02:18,362
Rym: But this one this was my favorite game I had not yet played at PAX and the thing is my second favorite one is deep-sea adventure Which is also about a submarine, but it's not co-op II know it.

1080
01:02:18,382 --> 01:02:19,085
Scott: Well, it's it's.

1081
01:02:20,511 --> 01:02:21,174
Scott: It's.

1082
01:02:21,255 --> 01:02:24,410
Rym: it's like yeah, it's the opposite of co-op competitive.

1083
01:02:24,792 --> 01:02:28,150
Rym: No, but you share a space and you're just fucking each other in that space.

1084
01:02:28,190 --> 01:02:31,288
Scott: I mean you share a space in T&E and you're fucking each other in that space.

1085
01:02:31,308 --> 01:02:37,744
Rym: Yeah You're sharing oxygen and if you go deep That game we'll talk about in a future show.

1086
01:02:38,086 --> 01:02:38,590
Rym: It's super good.

1087
01:02:38,610 --> 01:02:39,110
Rym: It's super cheap.

1088
01:02:39,512 --> 01:02:41,460
Scott: So everyone with friends get captain sonar.

1089
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,950
Scott: everyone without friends who can't play captain sonar cry.

1090
01:02:44,050 --> 01:02:47,260
Rym: I am definitely bringing captain sonar to magfest.

1091
01:02:47,621 --> 01:02:47,962
Scott: Oh, yeah.

1092
01:02:48,182 --> 01:02:48,563
Scott: Yeah.

1093
01:02:48,884 --> 01:02:49,185
Scott: Oh, yeah.

1094
01:02:49,205 --> 01:02:50,790
Scott: It might be the only captain sonar at magfest.

1095
01:02:51,212 --> 01:02:54,890
Rym: Yeah that magfest especially because we have the suite we're gonna play a lot of captain sonar.

1096
01:02:54,910 --> 01:02:59,810
Rym: I think at magfest once people know how to play it like I can walk away and they'll just play it.

1097
01:02:59,951 --> 01:03:01,419
Scott: I don't want to walk away.

1098
01:03:01,439 --> 01:03:03,129
Scott: I want people to play it so I can play it.

1099
01:03:03,370 --> 01:03:05,201
Rym: I think we're gonna have more than eight people who want to play it.

1100
01:03:05,302 --> 01:03:06,026
Scott: Well, that's their problem.

1101
01:03:06,167 --> 01:03:06,509
Rym: We go Scott.

1102
01:03:06,710 --> 01:03:08,437
Rym: We got to form the all-pro team at magfest.

1103
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:10,325
Scott: Oh, you want to make a submarine?

1104
01:03:10,365 --> 01:03:11,570
Rym: That's like a civil submarine.

1105
01:03:11,650 --> 01:03:13,177
Scott: It's like me you two smart people.

1106
01:03:13,197 --> 01:03:15,909
Rym: Yeah, like you me you Alex Pete like that's unbeatable.

1107
01:03:18,253 --> 01:03:19,205
Rym: Scott Johnson could be good too.

1108
01:03:21,573 --> 01:03:22,498
Rym: Maybe I think it'd be good.

1109
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,370
Rym: You're about to disparage Scott Johnson.

1110
01:03:24,792 --> 01:03:33,748
Scott: I mean the thing is while Scott Johnson might be okay this game, especially if this team Scott How fun would it be to blow up the submarine with captain Scott Johnson on it?

1111
01:03:33,868 --> 01:03:37,910
Rym: Yeah You know what he does in overwatch.

1112
01:03:38,111 --> 01:03:41,290
Rym: So if someone's in a group like you can join like we can group up and join games together.

1113
01:03:41,794 --> 01:03:50,870
Rym: But say someone else is already in a group or already in a game You can just join that game as a spectator and in the next game or when someone quits it puts you on the opposite side.

1114
01:03:51,352 --> 01:03:55,470
Rym: So you can see Scott Johnson playing and join his game and kill him.

1115
01:03:56,551 --> 01:03:57,594
Rym: Uh-huh, it's.

1116
01:03:57,996 --> 01:04:02,630
Rym: he's been doing that a lot and it's really funny like I'll be playing and suddenly I get killed by Scott.

1117
01:04:02,690 --> 01:04:04,239
Rym: I'm like Scott's in this game.

1118
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:05,465
Rym: You son of a bitch.

1119
01:04:05,928 --> 01:04:06,109
