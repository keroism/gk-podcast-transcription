1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,970
Rym: It's Tuesday, May 24th, 2016.

2
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:11,271
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,841 --> 00:00:14,300
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,160
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight.

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:22,720
Rym: It's a fast food fracas with fast food franchise and food chain magnate.

6
00:00:24,464 --> 00:00:25,940
Scott: Food chain isn't necessarily fast food.

7
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:29,340
Rym: That is true, but I needed an alliteration with you.

8
00:00:30,222 --> 00:00:31,258
Scott: Let's do this.

9
00:00:32,781 --> 00:00:45,398
Rym: So yeah, there wasn't GeekNights in a while because we were packs, and then I got the flu, and then I flew to Hong Kong, and then I lived in Australia for two weeks, and now I'm back like over the weekend, and I guess we're doing GeekNights again.

10
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:46,258
Scott: All right.

11
00:00:46,621 --> 00:00:48,260
Rym: Anything happen while I was sick and then gone?

12
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,039
Scott: Yeah, something happened today.

13
00:00:50,677 --> 00:00:50,719
Rym: Oh.

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,219
Scott: So over the weekend, I made some cookies, and I brought them to work yesterday like I always do.

15
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:56,864
Rym: That's nice.

16
00:00:56,904 --> 00:01:00,200
Rym: I got our office springs cookies occasionally, and they're super high quality when he does.

17
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,639
Scott: That's how I always do, right?

18
00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:05,700
Scott: So I left the jar there in the office, and I left work last night.

19
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:06,829
Rym: What, that giant jar?

20
00:01:06,849 --> 00:01:07,660
Rym: Like the one that you always put?

21
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,243
Rym: Yeah.

22
00:01:08,304 --> 00:01:09,240
Scott: It was more than half full.

23
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,840
Scott: People didn't eat a lot of cookies yesterday.

24
00:01:11,842 --> 00:01:13,580
Scott: I mean, you can only eat so many cookies, right?

25
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,540
Rym: I mean, I was about to say, like you know me, right?

26
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,380
Rym: But even I have my limit.

27
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:23,580
Scott: So I've done this many times before, but this is I guess the first time doing it since we changed offices, but whatever.

28
00:01:24,281 --> 00:01:29,151
Scott: So when I come in this morning, I go to get a morning cookie like you do, and the jar is just gone.

29
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,740
Scott: Like the whole jar has disappeared.

30
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:32,609
Rym: Whoa.

31
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,880
Rym: And I'm just like- Wait, so like the jar was there empty, or the jar itself is missing?

32
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,160
Scott: The entire jar is missing.

33
00:01:38,622 --> 00:01:40,214
Scott: It was in the spot where the jar was.

34
00:01:40,274 --> 00:01:41,060
Scott: There was now nothing.

35
00:01:41,681 --> 00:01:42,046
Rym: All right.

36
00:01:42,086 --> 00:01:43,240
Rym: Someone steal your jar?

37
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,767
Scott: So I go around.

38
00:01:44,807 --> 00:01:45,894
Scott: Look, it was still really early.

39
00:01:45,914 --> 00:01:46,940
Scott: Hardly anyone was in the office.

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,720
Scott: So I go around looking for the jar, and I found it.

41
00:01:48,841 --> 00:01:50,920
Scott: It was empty and perfectly clean in the kitchen.

42
00:01:51,661 --> 00:01:55,677
Scott: So someone not only ate- So I start looking for all the cookies, and they're not there.

43
00:01:57,981 --> 00:02:01,800
Scott: So I don't, I mean, you know, if people ate them all, that's fine.

44
00:02:01,961 --> 00:02:02,686
Scott: I'm okay with that.

45
00:02:02,726 --> 00:02:04,540
Scott: That's the point, is people would eat them.

46
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:10,740
Scott: But I can't imagine that anyone ate that many cookies between five yesterday and nine in the morning today.

47
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,539
Scott: Yeah, especially like- Most of the people were leaving the office already, right?

48
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,580
Scott: They weren't eating that many during the day when they were freely available at lunchtime.

49
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,318
Rym: Well, I mean, you know me.

50
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:23,700
Rym: The situations were like I'll eat literally all the cookies we own before Emily even comes home from work.

51
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,380
Scott: You couldn't have eaten that.

52
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,060
Scott: Even you could not have eaten that many cookies.

53
00:02:26,201 --> 00:02:31,996
Rym: In that fugue state, in Wildwood, where Scojo says, "Hey, didn't I buy a whole dozen

54
00:02:32,057 --> 00:02:32,440
Rym: donuts?"

55
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,837
Rym: And everyone looks at me, and they're like, "Rym, how many did you

56
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:35,079
Rym: eat?".

57
00:02:35,563 --> 00:02:37,239
Rym: I only ate like seven donuts.

58
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:45,420
Scott: My suspicion is that the cleaning person just fucking threw them all out, in which case I'm going to find them and murder them in their sleep.

59
00:02:46,081 --> 00:02:51,280
Rym: But that wouldn't make sense unless your building has a weird fucked up policy of like no food overnight.

60
00:02:51,662 --> 00:02:53,160
Scott: No, we don't have any such policy.

61
00:02:55,321 --> 00:02:59,139
Scott: Basically, when we changed offices, my job is the same as it always was.

62
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:12,239
Scott: But basically, since changing offices, there are some improvements, like better chair, even though it's still not a great chair, and modern office furniture, better internet setup, the Wi-Fi that actually works.

63
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:19,120
Scott: But the culture of the people in my department is the same, and all the people in general are the same.

64
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:26,180
Scott: But the people who run the management of this office, like office managing, is giving me some serious problems.

65
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,579
Rym: Well, I know you can't ride your bike easily.

66
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,696
Rym: You have to lock it up outside.

67
00:03:30,301 --> 00:03:36,252
Scott: I was like, "The building has no problem letting me bring my bike into the building because I saw someone do

68
00:03:36,313 --> 00:03:36,354
Scott: it.".

69
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,539
Scott: And so did my other coworker who bikes.

70
00:03:39,642 --> 00:03:41,398
Scott: And I'm like, "Hey, can I just bring my bike in the

71
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:41,600
Scott: office?".

72
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,194
Scott: He's like, "There's no

73
00:03:42,236 --> 00:03:42,379
Scott: room.".

74
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,857
Scott: I'm like, "There's room right behind my fucking

75
00:03:43,897 --> 00:03:44,100
Scott: desk.".

76
00:03:45,062 --> 00:03:47,620
Scott: And they're like, "Well, if we let you do it, we'll have to let everyone do

77
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:47,680
Scott: it.".

78
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,272
Scott: I'm like, "Well, let everyone do it.

79
00:03:49,494 --> 00:03:49,776
Scott: What's the

80
00:03:49,816 --> 00:03:50,239
Scott: problem?".

81
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,994
Scott: They're like, "It would be an aesthetic

82
00:03:52,034 --> 00:03:52,539
Scott: concern.".

83
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,184
Scott: Whoa.

84
00:03:54,304 --> 00:04:00,040
Rym: If someone ever said that to me, phrased that way, I would consider just immediately quitting.

85
00:04:00,561 --> 00:04:01,710
Scott: I considered it, right?

86
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,980
Scott: So that pissed me the fuck off.

87
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,379
Scott: Because basically, you're telling me that you're that person who complains about the neighbor's car being too old.

88
00:04:08,687 --> 00:04:08,920
Scott: Yup.

89
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,203
Scott: Right?

90
00:04:09,264 --> 00:04:10,160
Scott: And I'm working for you.

91
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,380
Scott: Why should I spend eight hours a day helping you out, right?

92
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:12,562
Rym: Yup.

93
00:04:12,643 --> 00:04:12,947
Rym: That's it.

94
00:04:12,967 --> 00:04:13,899
Rym: You got time to lean.

95
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,696
Rym: You got time to clean situation.

96
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:16,541
Rym: Right.

97
00:04:16,682 --> 00:04:19,712
Scott: It's like, you know, my coworkers is still the same.

98
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,069
Scott: The work is still the same.

99
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,280
Scott: Everything else is still great.

100
00:04:24,501 --> 00:04:27,140
Scott: But I found out that I'm working for that kind of asshole.

101
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:27,861
Scott: Right?

102
00:04:28,145 --> 00:04:29,340
Scott: It's like, you know.

103
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:35,220
Rym: You could engage in an elaborate gaslighting campaign between you and all your smart coworkers to get that person fired.

104
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,258
Scott: You're basically like the CEO.

105
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,839
Rym: Oh, so the office manager isn't the CEO?

106
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,022
Scott: Right.

107
00:04:41,246 --> 00:04:42,039
Scott: Basically, right.

108
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,977
Scott: That's weird because my company-- No, the office manager isn't the CEO.

109
00:04:45,341 --> 00:04:52,920
Scott: But basically, they're like, you know, the executive-- The letter, I think the email said something like, the executives would not approve something, something.

110
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:54,382
Rym: Right?

111
00:04:54,402 --> 00:05:03,560
Scott: So basically, you know, at this company, right, we basically, you know, we don't really interact with these, you know, the executive level people, right, ever, right?

112
00:05:03,641 --> 00:05:04,400
Scott: Since they bought us.

113
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,240
Scott: Like, we don't talk to them or know them or anything, right?

114
00:05:07,621 --> 00:05:15,580
Scott: And only on like a couple of occasions, there have been like weird decisions handed down from mysterious unnamed individuals.

115
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,280
Rym: So, Scott, I can at least tell you, when I worked at IBM, it was like that.

116
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,899
Rym: Like, we did our thing and everything was fine.

117
00:05:20,421 --> 00:05:29,180
Rym: But like at one point, one of the senior management people at IBM, like top, top people, ended up being in our building, like in the same area.

118
00:05:29,723 --> 00:05:31,760
Rym: And a whole bunch of weird stuff started happening.

119
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:39,060
Rym: Like suddenly, like you weren't allowed to leave doors open at certain times and they had like rules about what could be left in public areas.

120
00:05:39,281 --> 00:05:44,160
Rym: And like all this weird sort of just annoying stuff started intruding into my work.

121
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,919
Scott: Right, my tolerance for that is very low.

122
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:51,080
Scott: So, and also another thing that happens, right, is the fucking cleaning people, right?

123
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:58,418
Scott: It's like they go around every night and if you have like a coffee mug on your desk, they take it away and clean it.

124
00:05:59,081 --> 00:06:02,260
Rym: So that's not that uncommon, Scott, corporate bullshit.

125
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:06,160
Scott: But it's like I have one on my desk and I don't drink any coffee.

126
00:06:06,262 --> 00:06:07,018
Scott: It's just there.

127
00:06:07,286 --> 00:06:07,476
Rym: Yeah.

128
00:06:08,023 --> 00:06:10,640
Scott: And occasionally, it's just fucking gone.

129
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,152
Scott: And I'm like,

130
00:06:11,173 --> 00:06:11,297
Scott: "Fuck.".

131
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,696
Scott: And then someone's drinking out of it and it's like, "Oh, Jesus

132
00:06:13,736 --> 00:06:13,998
Scott: Christ.".

133
00:06:14,321 --> 00:06:15,777
Scott: It's like, "Don't touch shit on my fucking

134
00:06:15,797 --> 00:06:16,040
Scott: desk.".

135
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,280
Rym: But that's a specific thing that's come up in like the last four or five years.

136
00:06:19,682 --> 00:06:28,680
Rym: It's like the clean desk policy where a comp- And I bring this up because the only companies that give a shit about that are the same kinds of companies who are worried about aesthetic concerns.

137
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:29,780
Scott: Exactly.

138
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,380
Rym: They want the desks to be clean.

139
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:38,120
Scott: Right, so this whole, you know, the whole management of this new office, you know, with this executive influence is pissing me the fuck off.

140
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:43,080
Scott: See, as much as I complain about like- But the problem is, is I want to go, you know, it's like everything else is great, though.

141
00:06:43,661 --> 00:06:48,275
Scott: But, you know, if I want to go somewhere else, the problem is, is I can't find anywhere else to fucking go, right?

142
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,260
Rym: What about that weird place that would have paid you money for like four days a week?

143
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,980
Scott: Are they even still in business, that place?

144
00:06:54,923 --> 00:06:56,580
Rym: If they still are at this point, maybe call them back.

145
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,458
Scott: You know what the business they were doing, right?

146
00:06:59,185 --> 00:06:59,960
Scott: This is the problem, right?

147
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,319
Scott: Okay, so I'd work four days a week.

148
00:07:01,501 --> 00:07:02,820
Scott: That's terrific, right?

149
00:07:03,263 --> 00:07:05,540
Scott: And they probably would have let- I got a bike ride into work.

150
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,760
Scott: None of those problems would have happened.

151
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:11,200
Rym: And Scott, in two years, they go out of business, and you just find another place that's the same and repeat.

152
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,440
Scott: I can't- there's no guarantee that there's a place that's the same.

153
00:07:14,622 --> 00:07:22,600
Scott: And also- Scott, you're a- The work that that place was doing is they're basically hitting the YouTube API and scraping the entire thing every night.

154
00:07:22,821 --> 00:07:23,620
Scott: I'm just- I know.

155
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,720
Scott: And also, they're going to expect me to do fucking work, right?

156
00:07:26,823 --> 00:07:27,459
Scott: I don't do work.

157
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:29,540
Scott: I sit around and get paid and don't do anything.

158
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,459
Rym: That's how this works, okay?

159
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:42,898
Rym: But Scott, I'm just saying, for someone who is a good developer, like a real developer, like a New York developer, like the kinds of people who want to be paid in money and not lottery tickets, you can pretty much just get a job.

160
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:44,980
Scott: that's- Yes, but all those jobs fucking suck.

161
00:07:45,121 --> 00:07:45,858
Scott: They want me to work.

162
00:07:46,822 --> 00:07:51,475
Scott: Yeah, and you- They actually want me to develop something, and it's like, "Fuck you, no, just pay me to sit

163
00:07:51,515 --> 00:07:51,656
Scott: here.".

164
00:07:52,281 --> 00:07:58,699
Rym: See, Scott, the way- this is why I wouldn't necessarily hire you to do any work, because I know you won't do it.

165
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:03,080
Scott: No, because that's exactly the thing, is these people are expecting me to sit there for a long time working.

166
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,219
Scott: It's like, no, that's not how- Obviously, I don't do no work.

167
00:08:06,802 --> 00:08:10,999
Scott: I get the work you're asking for done in 10 minutes, and then I want to fucking leave.

168
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:11,817
Scott: That's how it is.

169
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:18,979
Scott: And at least- no one will let me leave, but at least where I am now, I can watch YouTube after I do my 10 minutes of work.

170
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,519
Rym: See, I have sort of a different situation where I have more work than I could do.

171
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,418
Scott: Oh, yeah, and if your internet is filtered or monitored in any way, I'm not working for you.

172
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:33,938
Rym: That actually is a deal breaker, and I have said that openly, anywhere I've ever interviewed in the past, and that was always okay.

173
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,080
Scott: I mean, basically, I've tried both ways, right?

174
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:43,479
Scott: I've tried the, you know, be nice and try to convince you to hire me, and then come out negotiating at the end,

175
00:08:44,102 --> 00:08:44,182
Rym: and

176
00:08:44,222 --> 00:08:57,439
Scott: what happens when I do that is they want to hire me, and then I reject them because they won't agree, and then we just waste everyone's time, and then I've tried negotiating upfront, and what happens then is they don't want to hire me.

177
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,900
Rym: See, I always came in with a separate thing.

178
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:07,559
Rym: If I act like they already gave me the job and are just talking about how it's going to be when I'm there, that's how I treated every interview I've ever done.

179
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,420
Scott: I mean, that's, you know, the I want you to hire me mode.

180
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,940
Rym: Yeah, but at the same time, those interviews are always for places I actually did want to work.

181
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,120
Rym: Like, I decided, like, I do want to work here.

182
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,310
Scott: There's no place I want to work.

183
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:20,238
Scott: I want to not work.

184
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,459
Rym: Well, there's really no place in modern society for you.

185
00:09:26,063 --> 00:09:26,598
Scott: You don't say.

186
00:09:26,862 --> 00:09:28,920
Rym: Yeah, we're not post-scarcity yet.

187
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,920
Scott: I want to work as little as possible, but every place that wants to hire me wants me to work more.

188
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:45,199
Rym: Now, just saying, what if our Patreon got to the point to where you could make the same money you make now, but we were paid just to do GeekNights four nights a week again, but we made the same money we make now?

189
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,580
Scott: Yeah, if you've given me that much money.

190
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:56,119
Rym: No, but I'm just saying, as a theoretical, if the Patreon were at that level, would you be willing to put the effort in to do GeekNights four nights a week like we used to?

191
00:09:57,343 --> 00:09:58,177
Scott: Four nights a week?

192
00:09:58,197 --> 00:09:58,279
Scott: No?

193
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,959
Scott: Well, I mean, we just do four nights one day in the week.

194
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,940
Rym: We're incapable of doing two nights in one day now without considerable bitching.

195
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,727
Scott: But I don't have to go to work.

196
00:10:07,748 --> 00:10:10,620
Scott: I can just wake up on Monday, on Monday record four podcasts.

197
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:19,360
Rym: Yes, but I'm saying, is that an acceptable level of, like, required work and office work, everything all mixed in and money?

198
00:10:19,482 --> 00:10:20,280
Rym: Would that work for you?

199
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,494
Scott: It's only four hours a week.

200
00:10:21,514 --> 00:10:22,000
Scott: That's okay.

201
00:10:22,241 --> 00:10:25,159
Rym: It's more like six hours because it takes us a while to actually figure out what to do the show on.

202
00:10:26,203 --> 00:10:30,900
Scott: I think with six days of doing stuff, I could get up enough material to do four shows.

203
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:35,499
Rym: Yeah, I mean, I gotta say, having basically three weeks off of GeekNights just because of sickness and travel.

204
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,460
Scott: We could even do eight shows in two days.

205
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:42,339
Rym: Holy shit, do I have stuff for, like, a month or two worth of GeekNights just, like, queued up now.

206
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,099
Scott: But you'll forget it all.

207
00:10:43,945 --> 00:10:45,120
Rym: I put it all in Google Keep.

208
00:10:45,528 --> 00:10:45,760
Scott: Okay.

209
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,818
Rym: 'Cause I'm real smart now.

210
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,220
Scott: Whatever.

211
00:10:48,641 --> 00:10:50,500
Scott: So, in the news... It's not happy times.

212
00:10:53,226 --> 00:10:54,380
Rym: Meanwhile, I just went to my company.

213
00:10:54,441 --> 00:10:55,493
Rym: I was like, "Hey, I just want a bunch more

214
00:10:55,534 --> 00:10:55,736
Rym: money.".

215
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:57,294
Rym: And they were like, "Oh, shit.

216
00:10:57,476 --> 00:10:57,699
Rym: Okay.".

217
00:10:58,042 --> 00:11:00,040
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I could ask for money anytime also.

218
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,976
Scott: They give me money every year, and I'm like, "I want

219
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:02,339
Scott: days.".

220
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:02,848
Scott: And they're like,

221
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:03,296
Scott: "Eh.".

222
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:13,760
Rym: Well, if you know you're not going to take the days anyway, just start getting more and more money, and maybe you'll build up enough of a nest egg of money by doing that to be able to take a bit more risk later.

223
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:17,339
Scott: I mean, I could just, you know... I don't want to take any risks.

224
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,180
Scott: This doesn't work.

225
00:11:18,421 --> 00:11:19,797
Scott: I need to stay in New York City.

226
00:11:21,744 --> 00:11:24,580
Scott: If I was going to leave New York City, I could just not work for years.

227
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,135
Scott: Wait, Scott.

228
00:11:25,721 --> 00:11:29,199
Rym: You just want to live in New York and not have to do really work.

229
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:29,757
Scott: Yes.

230
00:11:30,642 --> 00:11:32,240
Rym: Work for the city in some sort of union.

231
00:11:33,164 --> 00:11:33,800
Scott: Like what union?

232
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,246
Rym: I don't know.

233
00:11:34,267 --> 00:11:34,716
Rym: Work for the MTA.

234
00:11:35,981 --> 00:11:36,899
Scott: That's not enough money.

235
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,538
Rym: Yeah, it's enough money to live here.

236
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,179
Scott: Not enough money to leave the apartment I have now.

237
00:11:41,521 --> 00:11:41,704
Rym: Oh, no.

238
00:11:41,725 --> 00:11:42,620
Rym: You'd be in a shitty apartment.

239
00:11:43,902 --> 00:11:46,758
Scott: I could move to a shitty apartment now if I wanted to and save a bunch of money.

240
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:50,980
Rym: Just remember, we could go back to Beacon and live there for five years just on our savings.

241
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,418
Scott: Yeah, I'm not taking any trains.

242
00:11:53,025 --> 00:11:54,440
Rym: No, but we wouldn't be working anymore.

243
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,216
Rym: We'd just be living up there.

244
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:57,200
Rym: Burning savings for five years.

245
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,331
Rym: And then, I don't know, crime.

246
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,120
Scott: Yeah.

247
00:12:01,784 --> 00:12:04,920
Rym: Anyway, as you guys might have noticed, we've been playing a lot of Civ V suddenly.

248
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,900
Rym: Like, just that bell rang and we've been playing.

249
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,020
Rym: Like, I'm in five GMR games right now.

250
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:11,899
Scott: I'm in one.

251
00:12:12,605 --> 00:12:12,800
Scott: Yup.

252
00:12:13,081 --> 00:12:14,320
Scott: I don't know what you're doing with your life.

253
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,200
Scott: Do you have time for five?

254
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:25,800
Rym: It does not take a lot of time to play GMR games because the only game I'm putting serious effort into is the big game I'm playing with the rest of the FRC, which you and James were eliminated from and everyone else is dangerous.

255
00:12:27,641 --> 00:12:38,460
Rym: So, it's funny and weird to me that we just, for whatever reason, doubled down on playing Civ V. Like, serious multiplayer Civ V. And then, they're just like, "Oh, yeah, guys.

256
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,597
Rym: Civ VI is coming out October next

257
00:12:40,637 --> 00:12:40,819
Rym: year.".

258
00:12:41,101 --> 00:12:42,399
Scott: Civ V is a lot older than you think.

259
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:42,856
Rym: I know.

260
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,152
Scott: We saw it at PAX once.

261
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,139
Scott: It was like when it came out.

262
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,278
Rym: Wasn't that the same PAX we brought John St.

263
00:12:48,298 --> 00:12:48,520
Rym: John?

264
00:12:48,621 --> 00:12:49,418
Rym: I'm pretty sure it was.

265
00:12:49,704 --> 00:12:50,420
Rym: That was a long time ago.

266
00:12:50,502 --> 00:12:50,917
Scott: It might have been.

267
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:55,581
Scott: The release date of Civ V was 2010.

268
00:12:55,581 --> 00:12:57,360
Scott: September 2010.

269
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:03,580
Rym: Remember, Civ V was kind of a shit game that didn't really exist until Brave New World, the second major expansion.

270
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,860
Rym: Just like Civ IV was kind of a shit game until the final expansion.

271
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,120
Scott: I don't really remember too much the difference because I didn't play it so extensively.

272
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,679
Scott: I played it a lot.

273
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,700
Rym: When Civ V first came out, it was boring, unplayable bullshit.

274
00:13:17,841 --> 00:13:20,220
Rym: I played through it twice, and I was literally done with it.

275
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,559
Rym: There was no reason to ever play it again.

276
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,219
Rym: It was that bad.

277
00:13:24,662 --> 00:13:27,240
Rym: Gods and Kings gave me one more playthrough.

278
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,560
Rym: Brave New World made it a game that I'm willing to play.

279
00:13:31,702 --> 00:13:37,746
Scott: I don't even know which stuff was added in which expansions because I played the original a little bit, you know, and then I didn't.

280
00:13:39,281 --> 00:13:40,880
Scott: And then, there was some Steam sale.

281
00:13:41,281 --> 00:13:42,440
Scott: The whole everything.

282
00:13:42,641 --> 00:13:43,799
Scott: So, Scott, I'll give you an example.

283
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,019
Rym: Ideologies, that's new.

284
00:13:46,844 --> 00:13:49,518
Rym: All that crazy endgame stuff is brand new.

285
00:13:50,684 --> 00:13:51,520
Scott: What ideologies?

286
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,900
Rym: You don't know about ideologies?

287
00:13:54,724 --> 00:13:55,420
Scott: What are you talking about?

288
00:13:56,262 --> 00:13:58,419
Rym: The thing called ideology in Civ.

289
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,138
Scott: Where is it?

290
00:13:59,821 --> 00:14:03,819
Rym: Once you hit the industrial era, someone picks fascism, order.

291
00:14:04,941 --> 00:14:07,659
Rym: You'd pick autocracy, order, or democracy.

292
00:14:07,841 --> 00:14:10,820
Scott: Oh, that thing on the left where it's like these three symbols for each one?

293
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:10,989
Scott: Yeah.

294
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,779
Scott: I didn't figure out what those really do.

295
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,375
Scott: Really?

296
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,440
Rym: That's the best part of Civ.

297
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:19,479
Scott: I don't really know what makes them appear or which ones to choose or what effects they have.

298
00:14:19,685 --> 00:14:20,158
Rym: I'll tell you this.

299
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:24,580
Rym: It appears when, as soon as you build, three factories.

300
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:25,899
Scott: Oh, you know why?

301
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:34,059
Scott: That's why I don't see it too often because so many fucking times I play this goddamn game and there just happens to not be any coal near me and I can't get any fucking coal.

302
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:34,700
Scott: Yes, you can.

303
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,479
Rym: There's going to be like four city states that have got coal.

304
00:14:37,981 --> 00:14:39,900
Scott: How did I get the city state to give me coal?

305
00:14:40,262 --> 00:14:41,139
Rym: Just be allies with them.

306
00:14:41,823 --> 00:14:43,320
Scott: I can't get them to be allies with me.

307
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,440
Rym: Give them money or do the quests.

308
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,460
Scott: Allies require so much influence with the city state.

309
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,620
Rym: Hey, it is so easy.

310
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,900
Rym: Scott, I'm already in the solo gamer plan right now.

311
00:14:51,401 --> 00:14:53,779
Rym: I am allied with one city state and friends with two more.

312
00:14:54,100 --> 00:15:00,514
Scott: Yeah, the two city states that I can see have quests that I cannot possibly fulfill in any near term period.

313
00:15:02,461 --> 00:15:04,139
Rym: Scott, I know what those quests were.

314
00:15:04,502 --> 00:15:05,459
Rym: You can go for them.

315
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,200
Scott: There is no chance of me succeeding at any of those quests.

316
00:15:08,728 --> 00:15:08,880
Rym: How so?

317
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:15,238
Rym: Anyway, you might have some problems in that game soon.

318
00:15:16,381 --> 00:15:17,940
Scott: I already have problems in that game.

319
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,600
Scott: Well... I have no money.

320
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,540
Rym: Part of that is because I got that trireme blockading your whales.

321
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,259
Scott: Well, I'm building a trireme to divide my whales.

322
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:31,420
Rym: Yeah, well, let's see what happens in that trireme because there's things you can't see just out of range.

323
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,300
Scott: All right, that's fine.

324
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:32,859
Rym: Hanging out.

325
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:39,339
Rym: Anyway, Civ 6 is coming next year and something amazing happened after they announced that.

326
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,819
Rym: Daryl Surratt pointed this out, but I went and confirmed it.

327
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:50,000
Rym: Civ 5 went from not being in the top 10 to being the number three game people were playing on Steam.

328
00:15:50,802 --> 00:15:51,660
Scott: Over what time period?

329
00:15:52,301 --> 00:15:52,960
Rym: Just overall.

330
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,479
Rym: If you went in there and it showed today...

331
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,174
Scott: I'm saying when was it not in the top 10?

332
00:15:57,174 --> 00:15:57,980
Scott: and then when was it...

333
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:01,579
Rym: It hadn't been in the top 10 for six months or a year.

334
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,560
Rym: It just wasn't up there.

335
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,598
Scott: When did it hit the top three?

336
00:16:04,042 --> 00:16:06,579
Rym: The day after they announced Civ 6 was coming out.

337
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,720
Scott: Oh, so you said... Oh, okay.

338
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,093
Scott: The announcement... I thought you were saying...

339
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,620
Rym: Civ 6 was announced immediately.

340
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,380
Rym: Everyone was like, "Oh, right," and started playing Civ 5 again.

341
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,859
Rym: I think giant multiplayer robots are actually kind of pushing that too.

342
00:16:19,501 --> 00:16:21,199
Scott: How many people are really using that?

343
00:16:21,604 --> 00:16:22,240
Rym: A lot.

344
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,440
Rym: Go in there and look at the games that are looking for players.

345
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,659
Rym: Holy shit are a lot of people using that.

346
00:16:28,142 --> 00:16:29,619
Scott: I don't know how many people know about that.

347
00:16:30,442 --> 00:16:32,980
Scott: I can't imagine the percentage of those people playing on Steam.

348
00:16:33,121 --> 00:16:35,320
Scott: I imagine a very small number of them.

349
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,259
Rym: I would wager that at least a third of all the people who are playing Civ 5 right now are playing multiplayer with that.

350
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,099
Rym: Because you can't play multiplayer any other way, for one.

351
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,359
Rym: But anyway, Civ 6 is coming.

352
00:16:47,842 --> 00:16:51,020
Rym: I don't know if it'll be good or not because...

353
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:51,757
Scott: There's not enough info.

354
00:16:52,301 --> 00:16:55,951
Rym: Either they're going to release it and it'll suck and then they'll have their expansion.

355
00:16:55,971 --> 00:16:56,839
Rym: that makes it good later.

356
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,999
Scott: It's always good to assume that history will repeat.

357
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,240
Rym: Yeah, Civ 5 taught me that.

358
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,260
Scott: It's usually true.

359
00:17:02,724 --> 00:17:03,613
Rym: Civ taught me that.

360
00:17:03,633 --> 00:17:04,319
Rym: Every Civ.

361
00:17:04,962 --> 00:17:06,659
Rym: If someone builds an owner's workshop...

362
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,627
Scott: I'm pretty safe betting.

363
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:09,200
Scott: a new iPhone is coming in September.

364
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,299
Scott: Pretty safe bet, right?

365
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,200
Rym: Yeah, there's going to be an iPhone 7 SE in December.

366
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,348
Scott: It's a pretty safe bet.

367
00:17:13,388 --> 00:17:17,140
Scott: Civ 6 will be a lot like Civ 5.

368
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:41,400
Rym: But, if they're smart, and I don't want to impinge upon their game designers or whatever, but for real, they need to take the stuff that they added in Brave New World, like the current state of Civ 5, because it is the best Civ has ever been, and iterate from that and skip the phase where they make a stripped-down bullshit version like they do it in every other release and then add expansions to it later.

369
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:46,000
Rym: And I think that's what they're actually going to do because here are the things that they're adding.

370
00:17:46,781 --> 00:17:51,860
Rym: One, cities will take multiple tiles and those tiles can be specialized in some fashion.

371
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,460
Scott: So now I've got to defend a million hexes when my city gets all big?

372
00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:00,660
Rym: Well, it means maybe I take over your industrial district but the rest of the city is still resisting.

373
00:18:01,104 --> 00:18:04,640
Scott: Yeah, well, if my industrial district is taking over, how can I build a military unit to fight?

374
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:05,759
Rym: I don't know, we'll see.

375
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,380
Rym: Two, active research.

376
00:18:07,841 --> 00:18:09,779
Rym: So research is going to be more than just the tree.

377
00:18:10,263 --> 00:18:16,100
Rym: You can do stuff in-game, like build units and do things that boost certain types of technology.

378
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,580
Rym: So, like, go into the jungle and do some bullshit and get a certain kind of technology faster.

379
00:18:21,361 --> 00:18:22,260
Scott: So manual labor.

380
00:18:23,521 --> 00:18:26,140
Scott: My manual labor and not my worker's manual labor.

381
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,859
Rym: Well, no, because you can probably automate that.

382
00:18:28,182 --> 00:18:31,618
Scott: I mean, I feel like that's something that's abstracted by having a worker work.

383
00:18:32,365 --> 00:18:37,839
Rym: Yeah, so basically worker work can now also specialize toward particular technology things.

384
00:18:38,968 --> 00:18:39,152
Scott: Mm-hmm.

385
00:18:40,382 --> 00:18:41,380
Rym: Dynamic diplomacy.

386
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:46,440
Rym: So diplomacy will be... It'll change a lot more era to era.

387
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,180
Scott: The diplomacy with the AI, even in Civ V, is so bad.

388
00:18:51,386 --> 00:18:52,455
Scott: I don't understand how it works.

389
00:18:52,476 --> 00:18:52,960
Scott: I don't care.

390
00:18:53,952 --> 00:18:54,180
Rym: Really?

391
00:18:54,943 --> 00:18:56,560
Rym: Scott, one, it's really straightforward.

392
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:59,260
Rym: Two, I can tell you exactly how it works.

393
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,279
Rym: I know exactly how the AI will act.

394
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:09,000
Scott: The AI just randomly pesters me with things, and they're either bad or not, and I just either say yes or no.

395
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,260
Rym: One, it's not random.

396
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:13,060
Rym: And two, there's just a mathematical model.

397
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:18,300
Scott: If I try to propose anything to the AI of any kind, they basically say, "Oh, you want my luxury good?

398
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,757
Scott: Yeah, give me your whole empire and a

399
00:19:19,798 --> 00:19:19,980
Scott: city.".

400
00:19:20,101 --> 00:19:22,559
Scott: And I'm like, "No, how about I give you one of my luxury

401
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:22,680
Scott: goods?".

402
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,313
Scott: And they're like, "No, fuck

403
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:23,435
Scott: you.".

404
00:19:23,882 --> 00:19:27,840
Rym: If I propose things to the AIs, they usually just say, "Yes, awesome, Rym.

405
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:28,811
Rym: Thank you for doing

406
00:19:28,831 --> 00:19:29,217
Rym: business.".

407
00:19:29,542 --> 00:19:30,739
Scott: That does not happen with me.

408
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,960
Rym: Because you don't know how diplomacy works.

409
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:36,309
Scott: Even the AI that I keep trying to be friends with, like, "Yes, let's be friends.

410
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,738
Scott: Yes, friendship declaration.

411
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:37,960
Scott: Yes.".

412
00:19:38,021 --> 00:19:41,287
Scott: And then I propose something to them, and they're like, "Oh, you want one luxury good?

413
00:19:41,368 --> 00:19:46,118
Scott: All right, give me 10 gold a turn for 30 turns, and give me a city, and give me a luxury

414
00:19:46,138 --> 00:19:46,319
Scott: good.".

415
00:19:46,441 --> 00:19:48,059
Scott: I'm like, "How about I just give you one luxury

416
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:48,160
Scott: good?".

417
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:52,420
Rym: Are you asking for a luxury good that they have multiple copies of, or one that they only have one copy of?

418
00:19:52,461 --> 00:19:53,099
Scott: It doesn't matter.

419
00:19:53,581 --> 00:19:56,439
Scott: If I ever ask them for anything, they say no.

420
00:19:56,701 --> 00:19:58,280
Rym: Scott, no one else has these problems.

421
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:02,440
Scott: I don't know how to manipulate that into giving me a fair deal.

422
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:10,100
Rym: But the diplomacy against humans and multiplayer can be real intense and real useful, but it's pretty limited.

423
00:20:10,882 --> 00:20:12,380
Rym: It looks like they're going to give you a lot more options.

424
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:15,680
Rym: Like, alliances can be more later in the game.

425
00:20:15,921 --> 00:20:24,880
Rym: There are hints at things like negotiation mechanics, and there's even a hint, a vague hint, that there might be ways to make alliances for joint victory.

426
00:20:25,922 --> 00:20:26,820
Rym: That's a game changer.

427
00:20:28,201 --> 00:20:30,160
Rym: Combined arms, so actually, this is something you're going to like.

428
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,520
Rym: So right now, the one unit per hex thing is good, right?

429
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,960
Rym: Because it reduces the -- I have 400 military units to move around the map.

430
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:42,274
Scott: Yeah, it's more -- it makes it an advance wars aspect, and not just a, "I built more units.

431
00:20:42,314 --> 00:20:42,958
Scott: I don't care about advance

432
00:20:42,978 --> 00:20:43,220
Scott: wars.".

433
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:51,220
Rym: But the con was, if you want to do something like send a land unit over the water, you have to manually make sure it's protected by sea units.

434
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:51,980
Scott: That's a pain in the ass.

435
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:57,100
Scott: And you have to manually manage all your aircraft, so now -- Well, at least the aircraft, you don't have to move around hex by hex.

436
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,114
Scott: You just say, "Bomb

437
00:20:58,155 --> 00:20:58,317
Scott: that."

438
00:20:58,358 --> 00:20:58,500
Scott: Boom.

439
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,900
Rym: Yeah, but you have to manage what cities have which types of air units and what are they doing in their downtime.

440
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,878
Scott: I wish they would just abstract away all the military stuff entirely towards just, "I have more military than

441
00:21:09,898 --> 00:21:10,119
Scott: someone.".

442
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:10,785
Scott: I say, "I wore

443
00:21:10,846 --> 00:21:11,007
Scott: Rym.".

444
00:21:11,048 --> 00:21:13,019
Scott: It says, "Boom, Rym city explodes," because you have more stuff.

445
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:13,283
Rym: That exists.

446
00:21:13,303 --> 00:21:14,520
Rym: It's called Europa Universalis.

447
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,200
Scott: That's too much -- that doesn't abstract anything.

448
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,920
Rym: Plus, I don't want to abstract it, because I love the shit out of that advance wars nonsense.

449
00:21:21,261 --> 00:21:25,440
Rym: But, Scott, the new feature, combined arms, here's the exact thing.

450
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:31,560
Rym: For example, if you have an anti-tank unit and an infantry unit, you can merge them into a combined arms unit.

451
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,059
Rym: You only have one unit to manage, and they support each other.

452
00:21:34,821 --> 00:21:38,720
Rym: Or you can link a warrior to some settlers, and it's just one unit.

453
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,320
Rym: Move it out there, treat it like one unit.

454
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:44,260
Scott: Oh, well, then when the settlers build, do I lose this warrior?

455
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,640
Rym: No, then the warrior's just in the city.

456
00:21:46,026 --> 00:21:46,216
Scott: Okay.

457
00:21:46,942 --> 00:21:54,160
Rym: And you can make -- basically, you can link a bunch of units together into an army, at least for movement purposes.

458
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,468
Rym: So you can say, "Hey, army, go that way," instead of -- Yeah, that's good.

459
00:21:58,509 --> 00:21:58,937
Scott: I need that.

460
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,480
Scott: They claim -- All that stuff is stuff I need.

461
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:09,500
Rym: There's one lie item that just says, "enhanced multiplayer," which I hope means, finally, multiplayer will work, because it's never worked in any Civ ever.

462
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:14,599
Rym: I mean, giant multiplayer robot exists, because multiplayer literally does not work in Civ V.

463
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,499
Scott: I don't understand why it's so hard for them.

464
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:23,720
Rym: Yeah, it's like, I could design it for you, and the backend can't be that hard to set up, guys.

465
00:22:23,981 --> 00:22:26,156
Rym: If FPSs can do it, Civ can do it.

466
00:22:26,357 --> 00:22:26,720
Rym: Seriously.

467
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,079
Scott: Civ isn't even real-time.

468
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,814
Rym: Yeah, you can have one-day latency.

469
00:22:32,055 --> 00:22:32,979
Rym: I'd be fine with that.

470
00:22:34,742 --> 00:22:36,659
Rym: And there is an ominous one, however.

471
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:47,300
Rym: So everything up until this point that I've mentioned seems like really good news, because they basically imply that the game is going to be the current state of Civ V with stuff added.

472
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:53,600
Rym: It's almost like an expansion of Civ V with all of its existing expansions and a little bit of cleanup and consolidation.

473
00:22:54,320 --> 00:23:00,291
Rym: But the last lie item -- and this is from the Civ website -- "A Civ for all

474
00:23:00,411 --> 00:23:01,014
Rym: players.".

475
00:23:03,385 --> 00:23:10,080
Rym: And they talk about how veteran players will have new ways to tune, but new players will have easy ways to play.

476
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:15,339
Rym: And coupled with that is the fact that they're changing the aesthetic to look like Civ Revolutions.

477
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,508
Rym: Remember Civ Revolution?

478
00:23:17,528 --> 00:23:18,999
Rym: That game was garbage ass.

479
00:23:20,404 --> 00:23:22,020
Scott: It was really fast to play.

480
00:23:22,662 --> 00:23:27,550
Rym: Yeah, it was fast to play, but it acted like a free-to-play, nonsense Farmville kind of game.

481
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:29,060
Rym: There was no decision-making.

482
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,540
Scott: No, it didn't play like a Farmville game.

483
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:33,220
Rym: There was no decision at any point in that game.

484
00:23:34,745 --> 00:23:35,540
Scott: Did you play that game?

485
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,160
Rym: Yeah, it was so baby that I just immediately gave up on it.

486
00:23:39,361 --> 00:23:41,520
Scott: It was just a very much simpler Civ.

487
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:47,020
Rym: Yeah, it was so simple that there was never a non-obvious decision to make at any point ever in any situation.

488
00:23:48,481 --> 00:23:55,720
Rym: So it's interesting that they're taking that art aesthetic and applying it to regular old Civ, and we'll see where that goes.

489
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,940
Rym: I mean, we have almost no information to go on.

490
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,899
Rym: What I told you is literally all we know.

491
00:24:00,282 --> 00:24:06,619
Rym: And even what I told you was peppered with speculation based on vague things that they said about what Civ VI will be.

492
00:24:07,461 --> 00:24:13,719
Rym: So time will tell, but I'm not going to pre-order it because if it's a Civ V or a Civ IV or a Civ III situation...

493
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,255
Scott: Well, I mean, Civ V lasted six years, so...

494
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,860
Rym: Minus the time before Brave New World was unplayable.

495
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:23,440
Scott: Why do I need to get Civ VI as soon as it comes out?

496
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:30,980
Rym: Yup, the only reason to get it if it comes out is if it basically is the Civ V. Brave New World's just better.

497
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,218
Scott: Like Doom just came out, and I played the multiplayer in the alpha and the beta, and it was meh.

498
00:24:35,985 --> 00:24:37,800
Scott: It was just, basically, I could just play Quake Live.

499
00:24:37,961 --> 00:24:38,819
Scott: Why do I need to play that?

500
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:39,820
Rym: Doom looks super fun.

501
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:42,660
Scott: But I want to play the single player, but I'm not paying 50 bucks.

502
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,739
Scott: I'll wait for it to be 10 bucks.

503
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:44,590
Rym: I'll pay 20 or 30.

504
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,320
Rym: It looks that good.

505
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:46,180
Rym: I got money.

506
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,139
Scott: Yeah, I got money, but I get spent on other better things.

507
00:24:48,180 --> 00:25:01,979
Rym: Yeah, the only reason to buy a game immediately is if you have infinite money and infinite free time, or it's a multiplayer game that might have either a short shelf life or a short window to get good at it before you can never be good at it.

508
00:25:03,786 --> 00:25:04,040
Scott: Anyway.

509
00:25:04,742 --> 00:25:05,453
Rym: -Got any news?

510
00:25:05,474 --> 00:25:05,575
Rym: -I do.

511
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,180
Scott: So the spiel des Jahres nominees came out.

512
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,575
Rym: -Woo, exciting.

513
00:25:10,595 --> 00:25:10,697
Rym: -Yeah.

514
00:25:11,201 --> 00:25:12,980
Rym: I, for once, didn't look at that.

515
00:25:13,361 --> 00:25:16,477
Rym: So if you tell me what they are, this is actually me learning for the first time.

516
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:21,800
Scott: Well, remember, there's the spiel des Jahres, right, which is the main award, right?

517
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:28,160
Scott: There's the Kenner spiel des Jahres, which is like the connoisseurs, right, award.

518
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,640
Scott: Those are like the fancy games, right?

519
00:25:30,961 --> 00:25:33,679
Scott: And then there's the Kinderspiel, which is the kids' games.

520
00:25:34,304 --> 00:25:41,719
Scott: So the Kinderspiel, the kids' games, was a game called Leo muss zum frissur, which is Leo goes to the barber, never heard of it.

521
00:25:42,381 --> 00:25:45,800
Rym: I've heard of that because I heard people talking about it.

522
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:46,790
Rym: -Okay, sure.

523
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:47,640
Rym: -I don't know anything about it.

524
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:51,798
Scott: There's a Reiner Knizia game called Mmm, which I assume is about food.

525
00:25:53,262 --> 00:25:54,186
Scott: And there's Stone Age

526
00:25:54,266 --> 00:25:54,748
Scott: Jr.,

527
00:25:54,829 --> 00:25:59,020
Scott: which is, I guess, a kids' version of Stone Age.

528
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,329
Scott: -There's a bunch of honorable mentions.

529
00:26:00,349 --> 00:26:01,720
Rym: -I didn't like Stone Age, though.

530
00:26:01,863 --> 00:26:02,420
Scott: I don't know.

531
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:10,340
Scott: Anyway, the connoisseurs Kenner spiel des Jahres, there's Isle of Skye, which I've seen around but haven't played.

532
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,760
Scott: There's Pandemic Legacy, which I haven't played.

533
00:26:13,741 --> 00:26:17,817
Rym: Pandemic Legacy seems like it's actually probably a pretty good game for what it is.

534
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,840
Scott: And then there's Time Stories, which I've never heard of.

535
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,360
Rym: No, I actually have not heard of that either.

536
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,040
Scott: There's three honorable mentions, Seven Wonders Duel, which I'm kind of interested in trying.

537
00:26:27,561 --> 00:26:29,640
Rym: I've heard mixed things about it, though.

538
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,598
Scott: Blood Rage, which I've never heard of, and Mombasa, which I've never heard of.

539
00:26:33,662 --> 00:26:35,300
Rym: I've seen people play Mombasa.

540
00:26:36,283 --> 00:26:38,299
Rym: I've never played it myself, but I saw some people playing it.

541
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:41,300
Scott: Anyway, the regular spiel des Jahres, three nominees.

542
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,419
Scott: Imhotep, never heard of.

543
00:26:43,621 --> 00:26:44,158
Rym: I've heard of that.

544
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,120
Rym: In fact, I almost bought it because I saw it on sale.

545
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,597
Scott: Karuba, never heard of.

546
00:26:48,141 --> 00:26:49,740
Scott: And Codenames, which I actually played.

547
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,077
Rym: Codenames?

548
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,500
Scott: Because everyone's playing Codenames nonstop.

549
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:59,739
Rym: Codenames is actually a really good game for the type of game that it is.

550
00:27:00,623 --> 00:27:06,459
Rym: In that space of semi-casual, but also for serious trying to win social games.

551
00:27:07,102 --> 00:27:08,119
Rym: It's way fun.

552
00:27:08,906 --> 00:27:09,779
Scott: At least it's unique.

553
00:27:12,101 --> 00:27:14,240
Scott: And it's like, yeah, it's cool.

554
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,819
Scott: I just don't really ever want to play it.

555
00:27:16,782 --> 00:27:19,819
Rym: I bought it, and I actually do often feel the urge to play it.

556
00:27:20,343 --> 00:27:22,259
Scott: I have no desire to play it.

557
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:28,776
Rym: At PAX, when you disappeared with TableTop and never came back to go to dinner with us or anything, we just played Codenames all night.

558
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:29,616
Rym: It was fun.

559
00:27:30,963 --> 00:27:32,120
Scott: After dinner and everything else.

560
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,700
Scott: There's a bunch of other games here.

561
00:27:34,501 --> 00:27:45,645
Scott: The honorable mentions for the regular spiel des Jahres, Agent Undercover (Spyfall), Animals on Board, Die Fiesen 7, Crazy Words, -Quinto...

562
00:27:45,665 --> 00:27:46,900
Rym: -It's kind of an aside.

563
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:47,755
Scott: I don't know what these are.

564
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:52,080
Scott: But Codenames and Digs- Usually I know a lot more of the games that are on these things.

565
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:54,060
Rym: Well, because we've actually been kind of distracted.

566
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,440
Rym: It's been sort of video game and anime season lately.

567
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:57,977
Rym: For a whole year?

568
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:01,420
Rym: I haven't been super keeping up on new TableTop.

569
00:28:02,121 --> 00:28:15,060
Rym: Partly because the feed of my social media isn't half people talking about new regular TableTop games and half people talking about Kickstarter TableTop games, which are almost universally awful.

570
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,860
Scott: Yeah, notice how none of those Kickstarter games got nominated for any spiels.

571
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,360
Rym: Because they're almost all bad.

572
00:28:21,284 --> 00:28:22,000
Rym: Sorry, guys.

573
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:25,406
Rym: Sumer is the best TableTop Kickstarter game, -and it's a video game.

574
00:28:25,427 --> 00:28:25,831
Scott: -It's a video game.

575
00:28:27,402 --> 00:28:29,780
Rym: I think there's like one day left on that, so back it, guys.

576
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:30,900
Scott: They got enough moneys, I don't care.

577
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,700
Rym: Oh, as long as they made it, because it's really good.

578
00:28:32,941 --> 00:28:34,040
Scott: It's good, but, you know.

579
00:28:34,101 --> 00:28:40,000
Rym: It's good for- No one's made a game like that successfully in a while, and it scratches that mule itch in a big way.

580
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,539
Scott: Yeah, I just don't see myself actually playing it.

581
00:28:42,761 --> 00:28:46,760
Rym: I do, though, because I did some playtesting, and I got, like, Judith and Natalie to play it.

582
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:52,747
Scott: I also playtested it, but then I, you know, while I, you know, evaluated it and it wasn't bad, I wasn't gonna- -But here's the thing.

583
00:28:52,767 --> 00:28:53,719
Scott: -I didn't want to play it.

584
00:28:54,382 --> 00:28:59,956
Rym: Most people have never experienced mules, so I got Judith and Natalie to play it, and they were like, "Uh, this game looks complicated," or whatever, "We'll start

585
00:28:59,977 --> 00:29:00,140
Rym: playing.".

586
00:29:00,841 --> 00:29:08,162
Rym: But as soon as that bidding happened, like, Natalie starts pushing forward on the bidding, and I pushed past her, and she was like, "Oh,".

587
00:29:08,223 --> 00:29:14,959
Rym: and she pushed past, and, "Uh," and then I backed off at the last second, and then she was like, "Oh, shit, I was gonna do that to you,".

588
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:20,078
Rym: and then she bought the overpriced item, and, like, everyone immediately realizes how cutthroat that bidding is.

589
00:29:20,682 --> 00:29:22,099
Scott: Mule bidding is a real deal.

590
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:25,137
Rym: Like, mule bidding is one of my favorite mechanics in games, full stop.

591
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,100
Scott: It's a good mechanic, but we can just play mule.

592
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:32,019
Rym: But a friend of ours had a good idea, 'cause Dixit's in the same space as codenames in a lot of ways.

593
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:32,619
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

594
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:38,400
Rym: Just play codenames, but put Dixit cards out instead.

595
00:29:39,802 --> 00:29:42,080
Scott: So you have to flip over the right cards?

596
00:29:42,161 --> 00:29:49,720
Rym: Yeah, like, we came up with some rules for it, and I gotta tweak it a little bit, but there is a way to combine those two games into something- There's not enough Dixit cards, even if you buy 'em all.

597
00:29:49,861 --> 00:29:54,679
Scott: Yeah, but you can combine those two games- And you need to make all the stupid little, like, boards that, you know, tell you.

598
00:29:55,461 --> 00:30:02,020
Rym: You could combine them into something that was, like, a super dangerous, like, for real game with some amount of effort.

599
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,140
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

600
00:30:10,341 --> 00:30:15,519
Rym: I have two videos here, and it's very- They have to be two, and that is why it's my thing of the day.

601
00:30:15,881 --> 00:30:18,840
Rym: So this is a pretty crazy lock.

602
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,539
Rym: Now, they call it the forever lock.

603
00:30:20,961 --> 00:30:30,800
Rym: This thing, they sell it as, like, a bike lock, like a U-lock, and they also sell it as a lock you can use for, like, your house, like a for real lock, like the deadbolt.

604
00:30:31,342 --> 00:30:37,660
Rym: And it's got this crazy key that is- They talk about how it's effectively unpickable because it's a traveling keyway.

605
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,909
Rym: Do you know a lot about locks?

606
00:30:38,949 --> 00:30:41,979
Scott: Like, you ever- I know as much as any nerd does.

607
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:47,439
Rym: So the idea of a traveling keyway is you have this crazy, like, weird lock and key.

608
00:30:47,801 --> 00:30:52,657
Rym: So you stick the key in the lock, then you twist a thing, so the key is in the lock and you can't see it.

609
00:30:53,041 --> 00:31:02,380
Rym: Then you twist another thing, and now the key goes into a part of the lock that can literally never be accessed from the outside, and that is how you unlock it, so there's no way to pick it.

610
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,419
Rym: There's literally no way to get a pick in there.

611
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:14,800
Rym: And this video is like a six-minute video of a lock nerd going into extreme detail as to, like, why this lock is so for serious and hard to pick.

612
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,759
Scott: All right, and then someone just smashes it.

613
00:31:17,284 --> 00:31:17,738
Rym: Uh, no.

614
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:22,660
Scott: I mean, if you use it as a bike lock, it's like, dude, no one picks bike locks unless you have a really shitty one.

615
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,100
Scott: They just cut them with a giant, giant claw.

616
00:31:25,381 --> 00:31:42,359
Rym: Yeah, now, actually, I have another video, it's not my thing of the day, where someone points out that if you use the right kinds of tempered alloy chains and things, unless you use a powered grinder, like a powered Dremel, or a five-foot or longer bolt cutter, there's actually no way to open those.

617
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:47,700
Scott: Did you read that thing about the confessed bike thief, and he talked about how he used to steal bikes back in the day?

618
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,819
Rym: Yep, I think you've sent me a link to that.

619
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:50,360
Scott: Yeah.

620
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,740
Rym: Because we were talking about bike theft on GeekNights.

621
00:31:51,981 --> 00:32:02,419
Scott: He basically had a gigantic bolt cutter, they would ride around on a motorcycle, the guy would get off the motorcycle, right, clip the bolts, give the bolt cutter to the guy on the motorcycle, then ride your bike away.

622
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:09,967
Rym: But, I mean, this lock, like, you can use it as the deadbolt in your house, which at least that seems like a more reasonable thing, because, like...

623
00:32:11,103 --> 00:32:14,979
Scott: If I had my own house and I could put my own lock on it, I'd just get some sort of digital lock.

624
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,520
Rym: Yeah, but that might be jackable in all much easier ways.

625
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,600
Scott: Not if I made it myself.

626
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:20,833
Rym: Maybe.

627
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,999
Rym: That's like the people who roll their own encryption, like, maybe it's better.

628
00:32:24,661 --> 00:32:28,700
Scott: The encryption part, I would just get from some safe, open-source, trusted place.

629
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:35,460
Rym: But anyway, at least it makes sense, like, any lock in any apartment building, I could just bumpkey it open, like, if I wanted to.

630
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:39,080
Rym: Like, bumpkeys, like, I could teach any of you how to use a bumpkey in, like, two minutes.

631
00:32:39,344 --> 00:32:39,599
Rym: Sure.

632
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,327
Rym: They just work.

633
00:32:40,408 --> 00:32:41,280
Rym: Just open any apartment.

634
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:57,360
Rym: But it would at least make sense, like, here's a weird lock, like, basically can't pick it from the outside, except my follow-up video is a lock nerd who knows a lot more than that other lock nerd, who throws a lot of shade at that lock nerd and similar lock nerd.

635
00:32:57,481 --> 00:32:58,999
Scott: He says this lock is kind of nonsense?

636
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:10,220
Rym: He is like, whoa, guys, one, this lock is, like, really hard to use as a lock, like, fuck this UX, because it's got the weird key, and two, watch me pick it in literally a minute.

637
00:33:10,862 --> 00:33:22,319
Rym: [laughter] And how he picks it is an attack that I'd heard of, but I'm not really a lock nerd, so I didn't know what a foil attack actually was, and watching this video, I now know exactly...

638
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:22,778
Scott: Tin foil?

639
00:33:24,662 --> 00:33:26,320
Rym: Basically, it's foil tape.

640
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,239
Rym: It's tin foil that's sticky on one side.

641
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,439
Scott: I've seen locksmiths use that.

642
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:35,400
Rym: Yeah, so this video is great, because this guy knows way more about locks.

643
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,420
Rym: He's just like, yo, dog, this lock sucks.

644
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,098
Rym: Check it out.

645
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:52,259
Rym: And at one point, he's like, all right, so it's a dimple lock, and it's got two sets of dimples, and that's complicated, so actually, and then he starts looking at it, so this one's probably, like, a three, three, three, wait, are these all, are there really only three levels of depth here?

646
00:33:53,221 --> 00:33:55,280
Rym: Uh, wait, there might only be two levels of depth.

647
00:33:56,241 --> 00:33:58,160
Rym: Whoa, that's, let's not get into that.

648
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,557
Rym: Let's assume that there's three.

649
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,200
Rym: Now, a real lock will have, like, seven or nine, and this guy's great.

650
00:34:04,601 --> 00:34:06,180
Rym: This guy reminds me of that other guy.

651
00:34:06,301 --> 00:34:10,139
Rym: we watch the videos of, where he takes dodgy electronics, and he's like, wow, this'll just kill you.

652
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:15,899
Scott: Speaking of locks, how safe do you think your stuff is if you put it in the safe deposit box at the bank?

653
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:21,478
Rym: Uh, well, because I read FARC, I know, not safe at all, is that your thing of the day, those guys?

654
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,820
Scott: No, I just, I just thought of it just now.

655
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,580
Rym: Oh, some guys, literally, the article came out today.

656
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,299
Scott: It's in Historia, anywhere I live.

657
00:34:28,641 --> 00:34:33,980
Rym: They broke into a bank from the top, like, they just cut a hole in the roof, and just opened every safe deposit box.

658
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,800
Scott: They didn't open all of them, but they took a bunch of them.

659
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,620
Rym: They opened as many as they could and just took everything.

660
00:34:38,261 --> 00:34:38,880
Scott: Anything valuable.

661
00:34:39,183 --> 00:34:39,417
Scott: Yeah.

662
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:48,400
Scott: So, I guess the vault in the bank isn't really a vault, it's just basically a vault door with a room behind it, and you can just break into that room from the ceiling or through the drywall.

663
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:52,840
Rym: Yeah, I suspect the only banks that have actual vaults are, like, pre-war banks.

664
00:34:53,561 --> 00:34:59,838
Scott: Well, someone pointed out that if you go through, like, the desert, there's old Wild West banks, and the vaults are still there, and nothing else in the town is there.

665
00:35:00,122 --> 00:35:00,212
Scott: Yeah.

666
00:35:00,501 --> 00:35:03,560
Scott: Also, in Manhattan, you can go and find safe deposit boxes in old banks.

667
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,659
Rym: Yeah, you go to the places that, like, the ultra-rich people use.

668
00:35:06,002 --> 00:35:06,979
Scott: Yeah, we can go there.

669
00:35:07,424 --> 00:35:07,660
Rym: Yeah.

670
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,940
Scott: It's not really expensive right now.

671
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:15,459
Rym: The thing is, if I busted into a safe deposit box, the only things I would take would be SD cards and USB sticks.

672
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:22,680
Rym: 'Cause you know that that's, like, passwords to backends of dangerous shit.

673
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:23,350
Scott: Maybe.

674
00:35:24,421 --> 00:35:25,599
Scott: Anyway, so here's my thing of the day.

675
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:30,421
Scott: Back in 1994, when we were, like, 12, '94?

676
00:35:31,701 --> 00:35:33,399
Scott: At the Consumer Electronics Show.

677
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,820
Rym: I was in, what, sixth, seventh grade anyway.

678
00:35:35,021 --> 00:35:36,036
Scott: Right, there wasn't, like, an E3.

679
00:35:36,561 --> 00:35:43,398
Scott: Maybe there was an E3 then, but there was, you know, there were a lot of video games at the Consumer Electronics Show, 'cause it's not like there was a PAX.

680
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:47,939
Rym: Yeah, back then, like, there were gaming coms, but they were, like, Grognard old D&D style gaming coms.

681
00:35:48,101 --> 00:35:49,498
Scott: And this was the 16-bit era.

682
00:35:50,501 --> 00:36:00,414
Scott: So they were showing off at this 1994 Consumer Electronics Show a game for the Genesis/Super Nintendo.

683
00:36:01,116 --> 00:36:02,679
Scott: that never came out.

684
00:36:03,341 --> 00:36:09,460
Scott: But somebody recorded a video of this game with what I assume must have been a VHS camcorder or maybe Betamax camcorder.

685
00:36:10,343 --> 00:36:12,459
Scott: And that video is on YouTube here for you to watch.

686
00:36:13,202 --> 00:36:20,520
Scott: Here is the cancelled, never officially released, never found in any form except for this video.

687
00:36:20,841 --> 00:36:22,395
Scott: I guess all the code must be deleted.

688
00:36:22,435 --> 00:36:22,919
Scott: or who knows?

689
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:27,760
Scott: The officially licensed 16-bit Akira video game.

690
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:28,243
Scott: Whoa.

691
00:36:29,285 --> 00:36:30,499
Scott: Could have been a real thing.

692
00:36:31,262 --> 00:36:31,937
Scott: Never was.

693
00:36:33,502 --> 00:36:39,119
Scott: But you can see pretty impressive the parts that they made, mostly the cutscene parts.

694
00:36:40,202 --> 00:36:42,620
Rym: Yeah, Genesis games tended to have really good cutscenes.

695
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:45,560
Scott: The game parts look real bad, but the cutscene parts look real good.

696
00:36:46,641 --> 00:36:50,200
Scott: And I guess we don't know even, like, if the code for this is out there anywhere.

697
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,120
Scott: I'm sure if you found it, you would be mad, you know, popular.

698
00:36:55,543 --> 00:36:59,640
Rym: In the meta moment, the Book Club book is gonna be Oryx and Crake by Margaret Atwood.

699
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:00,559
Rym: Did you start it yet?

700
00:37:01,123 --> 00:37:02,079
Scott: I read comics instead.

701
00:37:02,801 --> 00:37:03,080
Scott: That's fine.

702
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:10,060
Scott: I was sitting there in my bed and I look over to the side and it was sitting there and right next to it was, like, you know, some comics.

703
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:10,527
Scott: And I'm like,

704
00:37:10,548 --> 00:37:10,691
Scott: "Hmm.".

705
00:37:11,322 --> 00:37:13,380
Rym: We can start it sometime before PAX Prime.

706
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,010
Scott: It doesn't look like... I got the book.

707
00:37:15,071 --> 00:37:16,380
Scott: I don't think it's that large.

708
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,519
Scott: If I started reading it, I'd probably finish it in, like, a week.

709
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:28,557
Rym: So, I was gonna just stop The Wheel of Time and just move on to other stuff, but in the 13th book, suddenly it was like, "Oh, shit, let's wrap up every single thread and tell you

710
00:37:28,638 --> 00:37:28,940
Rym: everything.".

711
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,259
Scott: Did they go to the Tower of the Snake People?

712
00:37:30,662 --> 00:37:31,977
Rym: They're on their way there, so basically...

713
00:37:33,003 --> 00:37:33,798
Scott: That's all I want to know.

714
00:37:34,363 --> 00:37:38,295
Rym: So, you know, I remember way back, a character is like, "Hey, what's the deal with this

715
00:37:38,335 --> 00:37:38,659
Rym: tower?".

716
00:37:39,001 --> 00:37:42,419
Rym: And someone from the tower is like, "Uh, you're way too low level for

717
00:37:42,459 --> 00:37:42,600
Rym: this.".

718
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,539
Scott: Yes, I read that part.

719
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:48,020
Rym: Yeah, so now, someone was like, "Guys, you're high enough level now.

720
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:49,564
Rym: Go into that tower.

721
00:37:49,987 --> 00:37:50,590
Rym: Here's what that tower is.

722
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:51,033
Rym: Here's the deal.

723
00:37:52,601 --> 00:37:53,630
Rym: Here's the deal with the doorways.

724
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:54,437
Rym: Everything's explained.

725
00:37:54,477 --> 00:37:54,659
Rym: Go.".

726
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:55,598
Scott: Tell me what it is, then.

727
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,619
Rym: No, read the books.

728
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,015
Scott: I'm not reading 13 books.

729
00:37:58,056 --> 00:37:58,360
Scott: Fuck you.

730
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:03,980
Rym: Or listen to the podcast because Kahlil White and I are going to do a podcast special on the entire Wheel of Time.

731
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,332
Scott: I only care about the tower part.

732
00:38:05,352 --> 00:38:06,099
Scott: Just tell me that part.

733
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,260
Rym: Uh, no, because it's real interesting what's going on, actually.

734
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:11,599
Scott: Oh, fuck you.

735
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:15,900
Rym: Yeah, you can read the books and find out, or you can wait until PAX and listen to the panel.

736
00:38:16,242 --> 00:38:17,438
Rym: It's either going to be a panel or...

737
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,859
Scott: If there's a listener out there who's read all these stupid books, tell me what the fucking tower is.

738
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:25,819
Scott: Also, if I wouldn't mind, just tell me what the deal with the dark one is, and then I don't need to know anything else.

739
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,239
Scott: I don't know the deal with the dark one yet.

740
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,619
Scott: I don't give a shit about anything else.

741
00:38:28,961 --> 00:38:30,819
Rym: But I know the deal of almost everything now.

742
00:38:31,323 --> 00:38:32,310
Scott: I don't care about those other things.

743
00:38:32,411 --> 00:38:33,419
Scott: I don't care about the two things.

744
00:38:34,701 --> 00:38:37,020
Scott: What's in the snake tower, and what's the deal with the dark one?

745
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,051
Rym: Yeah, you don't care about Slayer?

746
00:38:39,152 --> 00:38:40,140
Rym: Like, what's his deal with that guy?

747
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,040
Scott: No, I don't even know who that is, and I don't give a fuck.

748
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:42,727
Rym: I thought you were under him.

749
00:38:42,748 --> 00:38:43,599
Rym: Maybe you didn't run into him yet.

750
00:38:44,661 --> 00:38:46,413
Rym: He's the one who went back into the tower, I guess.

751
00:38:46,433 --> 00:38:47,320
Rym: I barely remember.

752
00:38:47,621 --> 00:38:48,260
Scott: I don't know who that is.

753
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,240
Rym: But anyway, I'm going to finish the books, and then I'll read Orcs and Crake.

754
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,751
Rym: The Geek9's Patreon is going strong.

755
00:38:54,771 --> 00:38:55,960
Rym: There's a bunch of stuff in there.

756
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,299
Rym: Emily and I have been reading a bunch of anime.

757
00:38:57,987 --> 00:38:59,119
Rym: We're going to be at ConnectiCon.

758
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,060
Rym: Submit your panels, because I'm literally scheduling the whole con, like, right now.

759
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:05,378
Scott: Oh, why is this so soon?

760
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:14,420
Rym: So if you didn't submit a panel, the places in the schedule I could put your panel are rapidly filling up with what I've already had submitted.

761
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:15,865
Rym: Like, I'm not joking.

762
00:39:15,905 --> 00:39:19,436
Rym: If you wait a week or two, even if you submit a good panel, you're just going to be SOL.

763
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,906
Rym: Pax Prime is coming up.

764
00:39:22,509 --> 00:39:23,434
Rym: I think Pax South.

765
00:39:23,515 --> 00:39:24,500
Rym: Badges are on sale.

766
00:39:24,881 --> 00:39:25,931
Rym: Notice how they're not sold out.

767
00:39:25,951 --> 00:39:26,699
Rym: You can totally buy them.

768
00:39:27,501 --> 00:39:29,472
Rym: Pax Prime Badges will go on sale any day.

769
00:39:29,552 --> 00:39:30,960
Rym: They will sell out within a second.

770
00:39:31,801 --> 00:39:33,259
Rym: So buy them as soon as you can.

771
00:39:33,981 --> 00:39:35,332
Rym: And don't even try to get the Sheraton.

772
00:39:35,353 --> 00:39:36,139
Rym: Get some other hotel.

773
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,400
Rym: Yeah, Geek9's will be back on its regular schedule for the foreseeable future.

774
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:47,260
Scott: I bought a bunch of equipment that I needed to make live streaming actually work easily.

775
00:39:47,421 --> 00:39:50,039
Scott: Because I tried to do it, and then I was like, "Oh, fuck, I don't have...".

776
00:39:50,282 --> 00:39:51,160
Scott: And then I was like, "Oh, fuck...".

777
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,045
Scott: And then it's now.

778
00:39:52,287 --> 00:39:54,420
Scott: I should have, by the end of the week, all the things I need.

779
00:39:54,923 --> 00:39:57,940
Scott: And then Saturday is the Philadelphia Netrunner Regional Tournament.

780
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:03,680
Scott: So starting next week, I'm just going to make a bunch of YouTube videos that are probably all bad.

781
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:04,261
Rym: Yup.

782
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:07,678
Rym: And you might have noticed, I've been uploading a ton of, like, CIV 5 videos.

783
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,260
Scott: Streaming and also not streaming.

784
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:12,639
Rym: And, like, panels we normally wouldn't upload, but fuck it.

785
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:15,159
Rym: We're basically just going to start cranking out a lot more content.

786
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:17,740
Scott: I'm going to make a bunch of garbage because there's nothing better to do.

787
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:18,261
Rym: Yup.

788
00:40:18,281 --> 00:40:25,320
Rym: But, frankly, a lot of content that's not 100% polished seems to do way better than a small amount of good content.

789
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,720
Scott: Yeah, YouTube seems to favor you when you do a lot of stuff.

790
00:40:28,041 --> 00:40:29,260
Scott: So, fine, I'll do a lot of stuff.

791
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:30,378
Scott: Don't be sorry.

792
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:33,099
Rym: The floodgates are opening.

793
00:40:34,302 --> 00:40:34,939
Rym: Looky-mighty.

794
00:40:36,103 --> 00:40:36,456
Rym: It's Epax.

795
00:40:37,805 --> 00:40:38,800
Rym: Our friends Chris and Anthony.

796
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:42,740
Rym: Chris has been bugging me in particular to play these two games for a long time.

797
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,858
Rym: Particularly the first one.

798
00:40:44,844 --> 00:40:45,617
Rym: And we played them.

799
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:47,477
Rym: Scott, we both played them.

800
00:40:48,201 --> 00:40:49,439
Rym: And now we can talk about them.

801
00:40:49,801 --> 00:40:54,459
Rym: But I stress, we're reviewing games that we played one of them once.

802
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,378
Scott: And one of them less than once.

803
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:56,981
Rym: Yes.

804
00:40:57,343 --> 00:41:00,480
Rym: So that is the level of review you're about to get, at least for now.

805
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:03,833
Rym: I might revisit one of the two of these once.

806
00:41:03,913 --> 00:41:05,340
Rym: I've played it a bunch of times.

807
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:08,840
Rym: And the other one, while I appreciate it, I'll probably never play it again.

808
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:11,099
Scott: I'm not playing either one of these again.

809
00:41:11,401 --> 00:41:12,979
Rym: I could play the second one again.

810
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:17,800
Rym: So, fast food franchise and food chain magnate.

811
00:41:17,962 --> 00:41:18,979
Scott: Which one are we talking about first?

812
00:41:19,121 --> 00:41:20,800
Rym: I think we should talk about fast food franchise first.

813
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,159
Scott: So fast food franchise is a game that I won.

814
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:24,737
Scott: I got a full web.

815
00:41:25,343 --> 00:41:26,840
Scott: And it's basically just Monopoly.

816
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:27,787
Scott: This game is Monopoly.

817
00:41:27,807 --> 00:41:29,160
Scott: You roll the dice, you move around the board.

818
00:41:29,463 --> 00:41:30,157
Scott: You buy stuff.

819
00:41:31,001 --> 00:41:41,159
Scott: But instead of buying hotels, you sort of by this weird system put little squares of your fast food franchise in this grid in the middle of the board.

820
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:47,460
Scott: And if you were able to connect your grid and I was able to, I picked the ice cream which is the most possible squares.

821
00:41:47,782 --> 00:41:50,340
Scott: Because it's not symmetrical, right?

822
00:41:50,923 --> 00:41:54,160
Scott: If you choose the fancy one that pays out more you get less squares to work with.

823
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:54,979
Scott: I picked ice cream.

824
00:41:57,304 --> 00:41:58,700
Scott: Just randomly I picked ice cream.

825
00:41:58,900 --> 00:41:59,980
Scott: But it had the most squares.

826
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:07,400
Scott: So I was able to make a full 100% connection between all of my ice creams on the entire board with a full web.

827
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:10,280
Scott: So anyone who landed on my ice cream had to give me a million dollars.

828
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,940
Scott: And when I passed go, I got like a zillion dollars.

829
00:42:13,562 --> 00:42:22,140
Scott: And the only thing that separates this from Monopoly is actually a pretty big deal is that number one, you get eliminated fast.

830
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,351
Scott: If you land on my ice cream.

831
00:42:23,391 --> 00:42:24,739
Scott: when I'm set up like that you just die.

832
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,253
Rym: Yeah, that's the way I describe it.

833
00:42:26,273 --> 00:42:30,296
Scott: Take Monopoly and you get a ton of money.

834
00:42:30,336 --> 00:42:34,499
Scott: when you pass go if you've got stuff set up and if you get a million dollars you just win.

835
00:42:35,643 --> 00:42:41,760
Scott: So imagine Monopoly ended after like 20 minutes, but it's basically the same game with a very small amount of decision making.

836
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,858
Rym: Well, the thing is, I would say that this is almost a deconstruction of Monopoly or a game like that.

837
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,700
Scott: Uh, no, a deconstruction of Monopoly would be Mad Magazine the board game.

838
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:57,139
Rym: Well, but what I was about to say if you deconstruct something, this is where you're trying to lose all your money.

839
00:42:57,723 --> 00:43:11,480
Rym: No, but it's almost too close to Monopoly and too true to the feelings of Monopoly to, it's not like Monika where you took, you know, the magical girl genre and said, wait a minute, look at it from another angle.

840
00:43:11,541 --> 00:43:12,168
Scott: I should watch that.

841
00:43:12,371 --> 00:43:32,920
Rym: This is more like Monopoly, look at it from this like pure distilled angle where it'll give you a lot of the feels that Monopoly would give you but in a much more streamlined elegant, fast failure model where it has the snowball of Monopoly, but then just as the snowball crests the peak game over, it's done.

842
00:43:34,065 --> 00:43:38,306
Rym: Like, uh, in both games that I played of this, I got eliminated.

843
00:43:38,892 --> 00:43:40,306
Rym: I was just out and you know what?

844
00:43:40,831 --> 00:43:48,709
Rym: In Monopoly, you're eventually just out eventually, but eventually in this game, like you're eliminated the second you can't come back anymore.

845
00:43:48,789 --> 00:43:56,164
Rym: Like within one more go around to the board, you're just out because you land on someone else's chicken surprise and everything's over and you just quit.

846
00:43:56,831 --> 00:43:57,195
Scott: and it's.

847
00:43:57,922 --> 00:44:03,780
Rym: it's oddly liberating because Monopoly is a game that I do not enjoy playing.

848
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:10,248
Scott: You get just trapped in Monopoly because you're, it's like you've already lost, but you have to keep playing because you're not eliminated, but you didn't officially lose yet.

849
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:25,820
Rym: But at the same time, but Monopoly at the same time it's, it's weird how it scratches a few itches around nostalgia and also like some of the gameplay, like it scratches a few itches, but then it punches you in the dick repeatedly while it's scratching.

850
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:30,327
Rym: Fast food franchise is just like fast food franchise pats you on the back.

851
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:31,178
Rym: Like it's fine.

852
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:32,752
Scott: Stop playing.

853
00:44:32,976 --> 00:44:33,180
Scott: Yeah.

854
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:34,245
Scott: Congratulations.

855
00:44:34,266 --> 00:44:34,611
Scott: You won.

856
00:44:34,632 --> 00:44:35,119
Scott: Stop playing.

857
00:44:35,261 --> 00:44:38,713
Rym: Like faster franchise walks over and says, Hey, do you have that itch?

858
00:44:38,754 --> 00:44:40,411
Rym: that says, Hey, maybe I should play Monopoly?

859
00:44:40,734 --> 00:44:42,659
Rym: It scratches that itch really, really good.

860
00:44:43,243 --> 00:44:44,010
Rym: And then it walks away.

861
00:44:44,171 --> 00:44:50,713
Scott: I think the thing it's missing that Monopoly has is the sort of like dog boat, Mr.

862
00:44:50,733 --> 00:44:52,209
Scott: Monopoly go to jail.

863
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:55,340
Rym: It has that because it's got chicken surprise.

864
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:58,835
Scott: Yeah, but chicken surprise isn't as good as like, Oh, go to jail.

865
00:44:58,875 --> 00:44:59,844
Scott: Do not pass go.

866
00:44:59,864 --> 00:45:00,409
Rym: Are you kidding?

867
00:45:00,692 --> 00:45:01,560
Rym: Chicken surprise.

868
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,440
Rym: You're running a fast food franchise.

869
00:45:03,622 --> 00:45:05,140
Rym: you don't have called chicken surprise.

870
00:45:06,023 --> 00:45:07,903
Scott: And you don't have bank error in your face.

871
00:45:08,408 --> 00:45:11,096
Rym: You have to click on the link and look at what this game looks like.

872
00:45:11,217 --> 00:45:13,659
Scott: You don't have like when you don't win the beauty pageant.

873
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:14,385
Rym: This.

874
00:45:14,567 --> 00:45:16,389
Rym: Yes, you do on those cars.

875
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:16,712
Scott: Isn't it?

876
00:45:16,752 --> 00:45:18,590
Scott: Wasn't it second place in beauty pageants?

877
00:45:18,671 --> 00:45:19,075
Scott: Yeah.

878
00:45:19,398 --> 00:45:23,132
Rym: But the the aesthetic of this game be no railroad.

879
00:45:23,193 --> 00:45:30,589
Rym: Take a ride, bitch, has been variously described by people I've shown it to as interesting minimalist.

880
00:45:31,155 --> 00:45:32,025
Rym: What the fuck?

881
00:45:32,651 --> 00:45:33,600
Rym: That is horrible.

882
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:34,201
Scott: Right.

883
00:45:34,222 --> 00:45:36,873
Scott: Well, because this is a small press game from the nineties, right?

884
00:45:36,974 --> 00:45:37,298
Scott: Yes.

885
00:45:37,439 --> 00:45:46,610
Scott: Oh, so if you think about like, you know, the the relative production value of like indie game, indie tabletop games today to, you know, the super professional ones.

886
00:45:47,156 --> 00:45:50,349
Scott: Think about what an indie tabletop board game looked like in the 90s.

887
00:45:50,369 --> 00:45:57,480
Rym: But Scott, the logo of chicken surprise is so wonderful that that is the equivalent of the top hat.

888
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,360
Scott: It's not a battleship blowing up a top hat.

889
00:45:59,582 --> 00:46:00,939
Rym: I think it's on the same level.

890
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:01,885
Rym: I don't.

891
00:46:01,945 --> 00:46:03,260
Rym: Maybe I'm just really into chicken surprise.

892
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:04,469
Rym: I want to make a T-shirt.

893
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:05,035
Rym: I'm also.

894
00:46:05,177 --> 00:46:08,530
Scott: I'm also kind of into the, you know, monopoly characters.

895
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:09,600
Rym: No one remembers this game.

896
00:46:09,721 --> 00:46:11,563
Rym: You know, I'm going to do because I've got Amazon merch.

897
00:46:11,604 --> 00:46:12,411
Scott: Just print one.

898
00:46:12,633 --> 00:46:18,732
Rym: The chicken surprise T-shirt is going to be that color and it's just going to be the chicken surprise logo blown up front and center.

899
00:46:18,753 --> 00:46:19,076
Rym: And that's it.

900
00:46:19,863 --> 00:46:20,166
Scott: Do it.

901
00:46:20,348 --> 00:46:24,712
Rym: I'm going to make that shirt on Amazon just so I can buy myself a copy of it.

902
00:46:24,793 --> 00:46:25,864
Scott: Shit talking is happening.

903
00:46:26,066 --> 00:46:28,853
Rym: I don't think you understand how quickly I can make a T-shirt.

904
00:46:29,095 --> 00:46:33,965
Rym: Remember that listener who made that ugly fan art of us that I'm, for whatever reason, like really obsessed with?

905
00:46:34,268 --> 00:46:35,560
Scott: I don't know which ugly fan art that is.

906
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:39,019
Rym: The one that's like a stylized Ren and Stimpy looking versions of our faces?

907
00:46:39,621 --> 00:46:40,005
Scott: Maybe.

908
00:46:40,813 --> 00:46:41,985
Rym: There's a Dave and Joel one, too.

909
00:46:42,005 --> 00:46:47,098
Rym: I made a poll in the Patreon of, hey, if I made this GeekNights T-shirt, would you buy it?

910
00:46:47,158 --> 00:46:48,960
Rym: And the resounding answer was, what the fuck, Rym?

911
00:46:49,761 --> 00:46:51,238
Scott: Everyone is already giving us money.

912
00:46:51,279 --> 00:46:52,572
Scott: They definitely want the T-shirt.

913
00:46:52,774 --> 00:46:55,240
Rym: No, they don't want the T-shirt because they hate the T-shirt.

914
00:46:55,681 --> 00:46:56,672
Rym: Emily looks at the design.

915
00:46:56,713 --> 00:46:58,103
Rym: She's like, no, no.

916
00:46:58,488 --> 00:47:00,126
Scott: But it wasn't there a shirt where we were playing.

917
00:47:00,147 --> 00:47:00,814
Scott: We were Dig Dug.

918
00:47:00,855 --> 00:47:01,805
Scott: Why don't we make that shirt?

919
00:47:02,351 --> 00:47:03,676
Rym: Oh, I don't remember that one.

920
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:05,528
Rym: Find me that one.

921
00:47:05,549 --> 00:47:06,199
Rym: I'll make that T-shirt.

922
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:09,996
Scott: Someone made a fan art of us like a million years, like nine, ten years ago.

923
00:47:10,017 --> 00:47:10,845
Scott: We were Dig Dug.

924
00:47:10,906 --> 00:47:11,978
Rym: Find it for me and I'll make it.

925
00:47:12,401 --> 00:47:12,906
Rym: I don't know.

926
00:47:12,926 --> 00:47:15,430
Scott: I don't think it was high res enough to make a T-shirt.

927
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:17,066
Rym: I could get someone to redraw it.

928
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,703
Scott: I don't think the colors are good enough either.

929
00:47:18,723 --> 00:47:20,479
Rym: Yeah, but I could get someone to redo it just in the concept.

930
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:27,960
Rym: But Scott, I can make two hundred and fifty T-shirts and just sell them on Amazon.

931
00:47:28,643 --> 00:47:32,059
Scott: If you want to buy a T-shirt with Dig Dug, but it's me.

932
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:35,392
Rym: I'm making the Chicken Surprise shirt and then I'm going to email.

933
00:47:35,412 --> 00:47:36,522
Rym: Oh, is this Tom Lehman?

934
00:47:36,563 --> 00:47:37,270
Rym: Who made this game?

935
00:47:37,331 --> 00:47:38,466
Rym: It was, I think it was Tom Lehman.

936
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:40,536
Scott: Lehman's brother?

937
00:47:41,304 --> 00:47:41,486
Rym: No.

938
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:42,479
Rym: Yeah, Tom Lehman.

939
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:47,100
Rym: So, I'll email him and be like, yo, I made a Chicken Surprise shirt.

940
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:48,596
Rym: Do you want any money from it?

941
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:53,657
Rym: Can I be the official distributor of Chicken Surprise T-shirts?

942
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,440
Scott: As forgiveness instead of permission?

943
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:59,220
Rym: Well, I'll make one because I just want to buy it for myself.

944
00:47:59,561 --> 00:48:04,579
Rym: So, I have to put it in the marketplace, order it for myself on Amazon and then I could just take it down.

945
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:12,050
Rym: But I want to go to it and be like, look, can I make one T-shirt for each of the franchises in this and be the official T-shirt?

946
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:14,880
Rym: franchisee of fast food franchise merchandise?

947
00:48:16,124 --> 00:48:16,980
Rym: Fifty, fifty profits?

948
00:48:17,443 --> 00:48:18,295
Rym: Let's go?

949
00:48:18,376 --> 00:48:21,604
Rym: Because Ice Cream Scream is also a really good logo.

950
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:24,719
Rym: It's just like this minimalist guy yelling in an ice cream cone.

951
00:48:27,281 --> 00:48:36,399
Rym: it's also like the graphic design is like really minimal and weird but at the same time it's kind of beautiful because you look at this map like this board and you're like, what the fuck?

952
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:43,838
Rym: But then you realize that it's actually a surprisingly accurate map of the United States.

953
00:48:44,942 --> 00:48:45,489
Rym: In a grid.

954
00:48:45,873 --> 00:48:46,339
Rym: And it is.

955
00:48:46,922 --> 00:48:48,499
Rym: And it actually works out that way.

956
00:48:49,323 --> 00:48:49,607
Scott: Sure.

957
00:48:50,235 --> 00:48:58,820
Rym: But I mean I don't want to really get into the mechanics because we're kind of just talking about our impressions of these games, but fast food franchise is worth playing.

958
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:03,732
Rym: just get some people who are on your same wavelength, find a copy of this game somehow.

959
00:49:04,016 --> 00:49:04,360
Scott: Good luck.

960
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,840
Rym: Find Chris Reimer at any convention.

961
00:49:06,941 --> 00:49:13,751
Rym: if you live in Pennsylvania, just track this dude down, knock on his door and be like yo, Rym said I could play fast food franchise with you guys.

962
00:49:13,852 --> 00:49:18,460
Scott: I think this might be useful game if you have a family that refuses to play a real game.

963
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:19,919
Scott: You couldn't even get them to play Ticket to Ride.

964
00:49:20,865 --> 00:49:24,945
Scott: But you can get them to play Monopoly and that way you can play this and that's the compromises.

965
00:49:24,965 --> 00:49:26,420
Scott: They'll play it and it won't take forever.

966
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:29,999
Rym: This is both simpler and more complicated than Monopoly though.

967
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:31,265
Rym: It's hard to...

968
00:49:31,285 --> 00:49:36,519
Scott: But someone who refuses to play Ticket to Ride but will play Monopoly could possibly be convinced to play this instead.

969
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:39,370
Rym: But they might be scared away by the weird abstractness of it.

970
00:49:39,411 --> 00:49:40,260
Scott: It would be an improvement.

971
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:45,911
Rym: But I think this is a good game to get like high rollers, Scott.

972
00:49:45,952 --> 00:49:52,416
Rym: Like people like us or like Jared Sorensen or Chris Reimer and do a livestream.

973
00:49:52,517 --> 00:49:54,899
Rym: let's play of this game like all in.

974
00:49:55,221 --> 00:49:56,739
Scott: I think it's mostly a game of luck.

975
00:49:57,140 --> 00:50:02,519
Scott: You should gamble on this game and it would be a lot more interesting than gambling on other games that people usually gamble on.

976
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:03,348
Rym: No, here's what we do.

977
00:50:03,529 --> 00:50:07,407
Rym: We play the game and we all put up money and we do a livestream.

978
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:09,107
Scott: Play the game with real money.

979
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:12,200
Rym: But the YouTube livestream.

980
00:50:12,983 --> 00:50:18,602
Rym: we do a separate thing where it's basically salty bet and everyone is betting on which one of us is going to win.

981
00:50:18,643 --> 00:50:19,492
Scott: It's not exciting.

982
00:50:19,815 --> 00:50:23,653
Scott: Salty bet works because you can get a lot of bets on a lot of fights real quick.

983
00:50:23,956 --> 00:50:27,512
Scott: If this would be one long game, like 20 minutes no one wants to bet on that.

984
00:50:27,533 --> 00:50:31,512
Rym: The kind of person who would be fascinated by this game is the kind of person who would be all in on that.

985
00:50:31,533 --> 00:50:32,320
Scott: You're getting two people.

986
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:40,440
Rym: Anyway, seriously, if you care about game design at all if you're into this stuff, if you're into TableTop I'm not saying this is a good game.

987
00:50:40,884 --> 00:50:45,430
Rym: I am saying you should play it once and just see what's going on in there.

988
00:50:45,450 --> 00:50:48,580
Rym: Because I enjoyed my time with this game.

989
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:50,720
Scott: You can just read the board game and see what's going on in there.

990
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:51,549
Rym: I don't think you can.

991
00:50:51,569 --> 00:50:55,185
Rym: I think you need to play it once and experience it.

992
00:50:55,448 --> 00:50:57,046
Scott: You're never going to find a coffee so it doesn't matter.

993
00:50:57,106 --> 00:51:02,199
Rym: And I guarantee at PAX Prime you're going to see me wearing a Chicken Surprise t-shirt.

994
00:51:02,744 --> 00:51:02,856
Scott: Okay.

995
00:51:04,502 --> 00:51:13,999
Rym: So, the other game, which is a more traditional to the modern era of indie games game, is Food Chain Magnate.

996
00:51:15,164 --> 00:51:15,992
Scott: I can see why.

997
00:51:16,012 --> 00:51:17,507
Scott: I mean, this is a real game, right?

998
00:51:17,528 --> 00:51:20,093
Scott: Like a quote-unquote real ortho game.

999
00:51:20,295 --> 00:51:22,175
Scott: It has a kick-started aesthetic.

1000
00:51:22,418 --> 00:51:22,580
Scott: Right.

1001
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:23,649
Scott: I don't think it was kick-started.

1002
00:51:23,669 --> 00:51:24,174
Scott: I don't even know.

1003
00:51:24,316 --> 00:51:27,588
Scott: The aesthetic is actually kind of cool retro kind of style.

1004
00:51:27,608 --> 00:51:28,920
Rym: The game is beautiful.

1005
00:51:29,221 --> 00:51:30,031
Scott: It's not beautiful.

1006
00:51:30,051 --> 00:51:31,224
Rym: Except for the board.

1007
00:51:31,244 --> 00:51:33,913
Rym: I think the board is kind of bad and I don't like the design of the board.

1008
00:51:33,933 --> 00:51:40,368
Scott: The board is bad and it's like slightly unpolished but it has that sort of retro 50s diner style.

1009
00:51:40,652 --> 00:51:41,824
Rym: I'll put it this way, Scott.

1010
00:51:41,864 --> 00:51:47,219
Rym: The issues that we have with the aesthetic design are down to the level of those four.

1011
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:48,877
Rym: things should be colored differently.

1012
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:49,813
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

1013
00:51:49,875 --> 00:51:50,120
Scott: Anyway.

1014
00:51:51,582 --> 00:51:55,420
Scott: But, and I can see why people like this game a lot because it's like a real game.

1015
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:56,732
Rym: It's a high skill game.

1016
00:51:56,954 --> 00:51:57,944
Rym: It's an ortho game.

1017
00:51:59,176 --> 00:52:01,440
Rym: There's very little randomness.

1018
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:02,860
Rym: This is a Puerto Rico style.

1019
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:05,080
Scott: There's like no luck whatsoever.

1020
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:06,619
Rym: If you lose, you made bad decisions.

1021
00:52:07,242 --> 00:52:08,940
Scott: But, I don't like this game.

1022
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:09,938
Scott: I don't want to play it ever again.

1023
00:52:12,851 --> 00:52:14,127
Rym: And remember, we played...

1024
00:52:14,269 --> 00:52:17,140
Scott: Just because it's a game of skill doesn't mean that I want to play it.

1025
00:52:18,082 --> 00:52:24,195
Rym: Full disclosure again, we played like ten turns of this game before I was so fed up.

1026
00:52:24,235 --> 00:52:24,478
Scott: we stopped.

1027
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:29,020
Rym: Scott and I both hate this game but we have to be clear.

1028
00:52:29,423 --> 00:52:35,426
Rym: this game was brought to us by people who we trust who thought we'd like the game, which was interesting.

1029
00:52:35,870 --> 00:52:38,359
Rym: And I can see why they thought we'd like the game.

1030
00:52:38,962 --> 00:52:41,165
Rym: And I can see why they like the game.

1031
00:52:41,185 --> 00:52:46,018
Rym: I hate the game for very specific and narrow reasons.

1032
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:50,375
Rym: And Scott hates the game to a degree that actually frightened me.

1033
00:52:50,396 --> 00:52:51,690
Scott: It was just so uninjured.

1034
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:53,810
Scott: Like, you know, it was just so painful.

1035
00:52:53,850 --> 00:53:00,740
Rym: Like, we start playing the game and I'm like, alright, so I'm going to make a decision here but I take issue with the way this goes.

1036
00:53:00,922 --> 00:53:04,300
Rym: I feel like there's going to be a snowball that I can't come back from already.

1037
00:53:04,762 --> 00:53:06,475
Rym: I feel like the decision I made.

1038
00:53:06,515 --> 00:53:11,659
Rym: this turn round two literally ended the game for me and it's over.

1039
00:53:13,102 --> 00:53:19,243
Rym: Scott sits down and basically before I even got to that level now, he's like, "What the fuck is this bullshit?

1040
00:53:19,465 --> 00:53:19,868
Rym: What the fuck?

1041
00:53:20,332 --> 00:53:20,735
Rym: Fuck this

1042
00:53:20,776 --> 00:53:21,038
Rym: game!"

1043
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:31,180
Rym: And starts going apeshit at the table at length about how much he hates this game to a degree to where bystanders came over to see what was wrong.

1044
00:53:31,724 --> 00:53:36,619
Scott: Right, so much like Age of Steam, right, this is a game that kicks your ass.

1045
00:53:36,881 --> 00:53:39,223
Scott: You fuck up one thing early, it's just like you're done.

1046
00:53:40,112 --> 00:53:45,991
Scott: Unlike Age of Steam and unlike Fast Food franchise, Food Chain Magnet, you don't get eliminated.

1047
00:53:46,031 --> 00:53:47,773
Scott: You gotta fucking sit there, right?

1048
00:53:47,855 --> 00:53:55,749
Scott: So, the main problem with this game is that on the right side of the board, there's all these bonuses, right, that let you upgrade your abilities.

1049
00:53:55,810 --> 00:53:57,283
Scott: Everyone starts off on even footing.

1050
00:53:57,969 --> 00:54:00,253
Rym: But, they're all crazy permanent powers.

1051
00:54:00,334 --> 00:54:07,323
Scott: There's crazy permanent powers that are super strong and you basically upgrade yourself for the rest of the game.

1052
00:54:07,344 --> 00:54:10,980
Scott: Like, I am better at this now than everyone else for the whole rest of the game because I got this thing.

1053
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:12,111
Rym: And there's a million of them.

1054
00:54:12,131 --> 00:54:17,627
Scott: There's a ton of them, so obviously everyone's gonna get a different set of them and that's gonna guide their course through the rest of the game.

1055
00:54:17,668 --> 00:54:17,748
Scott: Yeah.

1056
00:54:17,769 --> 00:54:20,678
Scott: You know, and that is a perfectly fine mechanic to have, right?

1057
00:54:20,698 --> 00:54:30,919
Scott: It's like aha, I will be the guy who's better at A and I'll be the guy who's better at B and we'll take different strategic routes to build our machines and build different machines and see who has the most money in the end.

1058
00:54:31,441 --> 00:54:32,535
Scott: That is perfectly fine.

1059
00:54:32,636 --> 00:54:40,595
Rym: Now, the way you get these things, and I'll let Scott go apeshit on why he's so mad about it, is that there's things you can do in the game, like a million things.

1060
00:54:40,616 --> 00:54:42,193
Rym: There's lots of options like what you're actually doing in the game.

1061
00:54:42,213 --> 00:54:43,324
Scott: You've got all these different actions.

1062
00:54:43,365 --> 00:54:45,160
Scott: you can choose on your turn and different employees.

1063
00:54:45,221 --> 00:54:55,545
Scott: you can basically choose which employees are going to work every turn that you've hired and you can also hire more employees and that, and you can increase your capacity of how many employees can work per turn.

1064
00:54:55,868 --> 00:54:58,532
Scott: and that sort of is what you do on each turn, right?

1065
00:54:58,573 --> 00:55:11,139
Rym: But this mechanic, full disclosure before Scott goes crazy, it is a very clever mechanic that in a vacuum I actually really like, but applied to this specific game, I dislike it.

1066
00:55:11,341 --> 00:55:14,860
Rym: But I want to make it clear, like this mechanic has merit.

1067
00:55:15,242 --> 00:55:19,969
Rym: So the way the mechanic works is if you do a thing, like every power has a condition.

1068
00:55:20,453 --> 00:55:30,538
Rym: So one of the powers gives you like a ton of pizza or whatever and its condition is if you are the first person to put a pizza billboard out on the board.

1069
00:55:31,381 --> 00:55:37,299
Scott: Something like that, like if you're the first person to hire a pizza boy, you get the super pizza upgrade and no one else gets it.

1070
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:45,420
Rym: Yep, one of them is like if you're the first person to fuck up and throw away food, you get a fridge that lets you never have to throw away food again basically.

1071
00:55:46,362 --> 00:55:54,065
Rym: And the way this works is if you hit the milestone, everyone who hit that milestone, the turn that anyone hit the milestone...

1072
00:55:54,085 --> 00:55:56,046
Scott: Right, so that's a perfectly good mechanic, right?

1073
00:55:56,066 --> 00:56:00,167
Scott: Because now you don't have a turn order situation where like, "Oh, Rym went first and he snatched everything

1074
00:56:00,228 --> 00:56:00,309
Scott: up.".

1075
00:56:00,531 --> 00:56:02,248
Scott: They figured that out, that's great, right?

1076
00:56:02,289 --> 00:56:08,267
Scott: It's like, okay, we'll give it to whoever does the thing first, but if everyone does it on the same turn, everyone gets it.

1077
00:56:08,590 --> 00:56:12,005
Scott: And then after, if you do it on a turn after that, well you don't get it because...

1078
00:56:12,046 --> 00:56:21,236
Rym: Yep, so if you do the thing, if you and me and Scott get the thing, because we both like advertise on the first time, no one else can get those powers for the rest of the game when you flip them over.

1079
00:56:21,257 --> 00:56:22,690
Rym: Now that could be cool.

1080
00:56:23,114 --> 00:56:28,791
Scott: Right, that's fine, because obviously if someone didn't get those powers that we got, they're getting other powers, right?

1081
00:56:28,811 --> 00:56:34,406
Scott: Because basically every turn someone is going to be doing a thing that gets them one of these powers, especially early in the game, right?

1082
00:56:34,447 --> 00:56:38,146
Scott: Where everyone doing everything is the first person to do that thing, right?

1083
00:56:38,226 --> 00:56:50,287
Scott: And if you see, you know, you can sort of tell what other people are maybe going for based on different things and try to choose things that they don't choose, but obviously if you choose the same thing on the same turn, that's perfectly fine, because you're going to get it too, right?

1084
00:56:50,489 --> 00:56:50,611
Scott: So

1085
00:56:50,651 --> 00:57:12,510
Rym: it's like whatever direction you push in, you're going to be able to push harder in that direction, and the game among skilled players would be, very clearly, because there's no real luck in this game, Scott pushed in direction A, and I'm pushing in directions B and C, so the competition is the direction we're pushing enough to overcome each other, like you're specializing in the thing you're doing.

1086
00:57:12,772 --> 00:57:21,520
Scott: Right, and then, you know, the game will actually come down to more specific decisions, like which spot did you put your advertisement on the board, and, you know, you can really get.

1087
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:30,066
Rym: Did you anticipate that Scott was going to push B three rounds and then swerve and push C a little bit, thus diversifying crazily?

1088
00:57:30,106 --> 00:57:31,219
Rym: Like, did you anticipate that?

1089
00:57:31,521 --> 00:57:32,369
Rym: Could you counter it?

1090
00:57:32,672 --> 00:57:42,899
Rym: Which is similar to what happens in non-luck games like Puerto Rico, where, did you anticipate that Scott was going the factory route, and set yourself up to capitalize on that, while you go the other route.

1091
00:57:43,642 --> 00:57:51,179
Scott: It's like, aha, you were planning to, you picked trade, you thought Scott was going to craft, but actually, nope, you didn't pick craft and now you're stuck trading nothing.

1092
00:57:51,861 --> 00:57:52,146
Scott: Good luck.

1093
00:57:52,592 --> 00:57:56,126
Rym: So Scott, regale me with why you don't like that mechanic in this game.

1094
00:57:56,186 --> 00:58:03,297
Scott: So the main problem is that if you fall a turn behind under any circumstance, you're basically just fucked, right?

1095
00:58:03,338 --> 00:58:07,520
Scott: So what happened was, is I misinterpreted some of the things in the game, partially?

1096
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:09,660
Rym: Now I think Scott misinterpreted them because he's dumb.

1097
00:58:09,902 --> 00:58:14,811
Scott: Partially because I'm dumb, but also partially because there's some issues with the design of the thing.

1098
00:58:14,831 --> 00:58:17,880
Rym: There are a few cards that need, they really need to be a different color.

1099
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:22,465
Scott: There are a few things that need to be a different color, and there's a few things that could be worded better, right?

1100
00:58:22,769 --> 00:58:30,163
Scott: But I still, I just messed up, I didn't realize something, so I made a decision where I thought I was going to get a thing, and I didn't get it.

1101
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:41,258
Scott: And the result of that was, I could not be the first to do pretty much fucking anything for the rest of the game, so I couldn't get any more upgrade abilities, and I was pretty much just done.

1102
00:58:42,306 --> 00:58:50,002
Scott: There's no way, and there was no because everything is first come, and that's it, there's no other way to get stuff, I couldn't catch up.

1103
00:58:51,032 --> 00:58:52,648
Scott: So why was I still playing this game?

1104
00:58:52,708 --> 00:58:55,860
Scott: It didn't, the game is a long game, I would have had to keep playing it.

1105
00:58:56,080 --> 00:59:04,608
Rym: The game itself, what they say on the box, quote, "This game can be played by two to five serious gamers in two to four

1106
00:59:04,953 --> 00:59:05,418
Rym: hours.".

1107
00:59:05,883 --> 00:59:22,548
Scott: And it's like, well, I fucked up one thing on like turn two, because I didn't get it right, and now, and as soon as I was afterwards, I realized it within like, you know, immediately, like, oh, that's not the thing that I should have done because of that, but it was too late, and now I'm just fucked.

1108
00:59:23,256 --> 00:59:25,139
Scott: But I have to sit there for three hours, fuck this.

1109
00:59:26,103 --> 00:59:27,863
Scott: I'd rather complain and then leave the game.

1110
00:59:27,883 --> 00:59:30,712
Rym: It was a little more narrow in that the game's a snowball game.

1111
00:59:30,753 --> 00:59:43,040
Rym: The way I would describe this game is, everyone starts at the top of a mountain, and they make a snowball, and the snowballs are all the same size, and you pick what direction to roll that snowball off the map, and they just accelerate and accelerate and accelerate.

1112
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:50,226
Rym: If you like, drop your snowball, if your snowball hits a rock or something, well, if it hits a rock, it was your fault.

1113
00:59:50,368 --> 00:59:51,559
Scott: Yeah, but it might split into, you know.

1114
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:54,570
Rym: Yeah, but you might, there's all these, it's a snowball game.

1115
00:59:54,590 --> 01:00:07,177
Scott: If you make any mistake whatsoever, right, and the thing is, you know, I made a mistake of a beginner who didn't know the game early, right, you know, and early is, I guess, the worst time to make a mistake, but you can make a mistake in this game at any time.

1116
01:00:07,217 --> 01:00:27,699
Scott: You could be really good at this game, right, not, obviously, if you're incredible at the game, you're not gonna ever make a mistake, right, but you could be in a situation where like, you're good at the game, you understand it, but say midway through the game, like, after hour one, you make a mistake, and now you're just fucked, but you already invested an hour in the game, but you can't win, but you still have to keep playing, and it's not over.

1117
01:00:28,062 --> 01:00:48,839
Rym: Now, Power Grid, base Power Grid is an example of a game where if you, like, if you play the game a lot, and it's a bunch of skilled fucking players playing that game, it ends up being the same way, like, if Scott has three extra dollars left over at the end of a round, he fucked up and didn't optimize for the last five turns, and like, that's the fiddly tiny decision that means he loses.

1118
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:49,323
Rym: Sure.

1119
01:00:49,505 --> 01:00:54,919
Rym: But that only happens after you've gotten to the point where you're all playing this game at like, ultra-pro mode.

1120
01:00:55,364 --> 01:00:56,760
Rym: In this game, that happens immediately.

1121
01:00:57,123 --> 01:01:03,890
Rym: So if I had to describe what this game is really like, and who it would appeal to, if you like Twilight Struggle, you like this game.

1122
01:01:04,597 --> 01:01:16,900
Rym: Because they are games where you have to commit to being very good at the game, and navigating the simple, because they're not complex, but highly divergent heuristics of the game.

1123
01:01:17,304 --> 01:01:21,566
Rym: They are not intuitive, you cannot play this game by gut.

1124
01:01:21,809 --> 01:01:23,183
Rym: It's like the difference between chess and Go.

1125
01:01:23,204 --> 01:01:27,424
Rym: If you just kind of feel your way through chess, You're gonna lose.

1126
01:01:27,667 --> 01:01:29,648
Rym: You're gonna lose, but you'll do okay.

1127
01:01:29,749 --> 01:01:33,648
Rym: Like, if you know the rules, and you have some basic knowledge of chess, and you watch the people play.

1128
01:01:33,668 --> 01:01:36,357
Scott: Yeah, you'll try to take more guys than the other guy takes, right?

1129
01:01:36,377 --> 01:01:36,499
Scott: Yeah.

1130
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:47,426
Rym: But if you play the chess in the long, long run, the attractors in chess are slow defeat, or else a draw.

1131
01:01:48,396 --> 01:01:53,284
Rym: In Go, the attractors, as the game tree expands out into the void, are all losing.

1132
01:01:53,708 --> 01:01:56,113
Rym: If you go in semi-random directions, you just lose.

1133
01:01:56,194 --> 01:02:08,477
Scott: Yeah, and it's not like in Netrunner, this happens a lot too, where there's certain types of play, certain lines of play that your opponent can have, and it's like, "Okay, I see that I'm losing this game, but I'm still doing stuff,

1134
01:02:08,598 --> 01:02:08,780
Scott: right?".

1135
01:02:08,841 --> 01:02:11,203
Scott: It's like, you know, "I still got stuff going

1136
01:02:11,344 --> 01:02:11,445
Scott: on.".

1137
01:02:11,546 --> 01:02:13,970
Scott: You know, like in Rare or Tycoon, this is a big thing that happens, right?

1138
01:02:13,990 --> 01:02:28,978
Scott: Where it's like, "Okay, I see I've lost the game, but I'm still moving cubes, and I'm still building tracks, and I'm still putting trains and playing cards, so I'm still enjoying myself and doing things, even though I know the best I can do now is second place, because look what that guy did moving 10 cubes or something,

1139
01:02:29,018 --> 01:02:29,139
Scott: right?".

1140
01:02:30,141 --> 01:02:41,059
Scott: There's certain things that happen, and in this game, where it's like, not only did I know I was going to lose the game after making a one mistake on turn two, but I pretty much couldn't do anything effective.

1141
01:02:41,099 --> 01:02:43,545
Scott: I couldn't sell even one food, right?

1142
01:02:43,566 --> 01:02:47,320
Scott: It's like, I literally could not do anything meaningful on my turns anymore.

1143
01:02:48,348 --> 01:02:50,171
Scott: If I played the best I could play.

1144
01:02:50,232 --> 01:02:53,384
Scott: from that point on, it's like, literally, I've done nothing.

1145
01:02:53,424 --> 01:02:54,212
Scott: I've made no money.

1146
01:02:54,233 --> 01:02:56,253
Scott: I can't get any more stuff.

1147
01:02:56,616 --> 01:02:57,283
Scott: I can't do anything.

1148
01:02:57,303 --> 01:03:03,928
Scott: I'm just, like, locked, and I'm not even, even if I continue to play and try and enjoy it, it's like, I can't build trains or put cubes.

1149
01:03:04,130 --> 01:03:07,280
Scott: I'm just sitting here doing nothing, making meaningless decisions.

1150
01:03:07,381 --> 01:03:07,908
Scott: I can't move.

1151
01:03:08,354 --> 01:03:09,466
Rym: Now, I'm going to say something.

1152
01:03:10,213 --> 01:03:11,405
Rym: This is a good game.

1153
01:03:11,445 --> 01:03:12,638
Rym: It is a well-designed game.

1154
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:17,445
Rym: But, and Twilight Struggle is a well-designed game for what it is, those kinds of games.

1155
01:03:17,808 --> 01:03:45,224
Rym: But, this is the kind of game that, because of these complex heuristics, well, not complex, because of these simple, but surprisingly divergent heuristics, and because of the harsh penalties for failure, and because all of the attractors in the game tree are ridiculous failure, the only way to enjoy this game, you have to be the kind of person who wants to pick a game like this, play it a million, million times, and become very good at this particular game.

1156
01:03:45,527 --> 01:03:57,910
Rym: If you are good at games in general, that will give you almost no assistance in being good at this game, unless you do what I was doing until Scott and Chris and Anthony yelled at me to stop.

1157
01:03:58,536 --> 01:04:01,446
Rym: This game also can suffer from extreme analysis paralysis.

1158
01:04:01,970 --> 01:04:07,425
Rym: I could have navigated that heuristic tree by sitting there for literally five or ten minutes of my turn.

1159
01:04:07,445 --> 01:04:08,920
Scott: You did take a fucking long time on your turn.

1160
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:09,385
Rym: Yeah, and you know what?

1161
01:04:09,405 --> 01:04:10,194
Rym: I did better than you.

1162
01:04:10,214 --> 01:04:10,295
Rym: Yeah.

1163
01:04:11,002 --> 01:04:13,706
Scott: I'm not going to put in that kind of effort, especially if I'm convention, right?

1164
01:04:13,747 --> 01:04:16,029
Scott: I'm not looking to, you know, right?

1165
01:04:16,272 --> 01:04:32,599
Rym: But I'm saying this game, the only way to be good at this game is to play it a lot, to be good at it, or to study it and do a lot of analysis and calculation, slowing the game down, which explains why they say the game takes two to four hours to play.

1166
01:04:33,361 --> 01:04:48,539
Rym: Much like Twilight Struggle, you have to play it and be good at it, because it has a whole bunch of name cards that do very specific things, and the game's only interesting if you know what all those cards are and what they do, and your opponent also knows what they all are and knows what they do, or if neither of you knows.

1167
01:04:49,161 --> 01:04:50,069
Rym: So you can only play this game...

1168
01:04:50,090 --> 01:04:58,516
Scott: Yeah, if you play this with a bunch of people who've never played it before, you could all make mistakes and still maybe not have a problem because you all made mistakes.

1169
01:04:58,556 --> 01:05:04,596
Rym: But then you still have to force people to not spend a long time on their turn, because if someone does think longer, it's like a choir.

1170
01:05:04,798 --> 01:05:11,020
Rym: If you actually calculate out, you could play this game very well the first time, and it's going to take the full four hours to play the game.

1171
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:18,640
Scott: And this game has another problem, which is one I've noticed in a lot of games before, one that always comes to mind when I think about this is Quarriers, which is the dice dominion.

1172
01:05:19,140 --> 01:05:21,810
Rym: Oh, that game feels like it should be so good, but it's not.

1173
01:05:21,891 --> 01:05:22,174
Scott: Right.

1174
01:05:22,638 --> 01:05:27,186
Scott: And that problem is basically big stuff never used, right?

1175
01:05:27,509 --> 01:05:36,199
Scott: So it's like, there's these huge cards you can get if you upgrade all the way, like these ridiculous employees, like the CEOs and stuff, like these ridiculously powerful cards.

1176
01:05:36,847 --> 01:05:53,956
Scott: And from what I could tell is if you were to play this game to completion, right, you would maybe get one of those cards like on the final turn or second to last turn, maybe maybe you would get one of them and maybe use it like once and the game would be over at that point, right?

1177
01:05:54,239 --> 01:06:01,815
Scott: It's like in Quarriers, you get like one fancy, super powerful dice and maybe roll it once and the game will be over by that point.

1178
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:07,833
Scott: It's like, dudes, if you're designing a game and you got big, powerful stuff in that game, at least let people use it.

1179
01:06:07,853 --> 01:06:11,368
Rym: Like in Civ 5, at least let me use the death robot for like 10 turns.

1180
01:06:11,408 --> 01:06:13,350
Scott: Hearthstone is actually a good example.

1181
01:06:13,411 --> 01:06:22,400
Scott: It's like in Hearthstone, you can play and put out big, amazing legendary creatures and actually use them a bit before the game ends, right?

1182
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:27,170
Scott: You can actually, you know, get to use the heavy hitters and enjoy the fun of using them.

1183
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:35,130
Rym: As opposed to Magic the Gathering, where if you got one of those like legends golden dragons of three colors out on the table, like good job.

1184
01:06:35,634 --> 01:06:37,148
Rym: Good job getting that dragon out there.

1185
01:06:37,290 --> 01:06:39,900
Scott: And then, yeah, you've probably lost the game before that happened.

1186
01:06:40,180 --> 01:06:41,634
Rym: Or you won a long time ago.

1187
01:06:41,654 --> 01:06:43,007
Scott: It's gonna die instantly.

1188
01:06:43,351 --> 01:06:48,462
Scott: You know, yeah, you've already won and you're just playing that because you've already, you know, because you can, because you're already controlling the game, right?

1189
01:06:48,482 --> 01:06:54,060
Scott: It's like, you know, it's like if you, the top level equipment in your, whatever game you make, right?

1190
01:06:54,542 --> 01:06:56,662
Scott: The top level, most powerful stuff, right?

1191
01:06:56,682 --> 01:06:58,703
Scott: The big buildings in Puerto Rico, right?

1192
01:06:59,127 --> 01:07:10,380
Scott: You know, whatever is the biggest, strongest stuff should be able to come into play, say, between 75 and 80% of the game's completion, right?

1193
01:07:10,842 --> 01:07:16,115
Scott: And then after that, there might be bigger stuff, but that stuff should be victory points only.

1194
01:07:16,176 --> 01:07:17,370
Scott: It shouldn't do anything.

1195
01:07:17,411 --> 01:07:19,430
Rym: And that way, you don't feel bad.

1196
01:07:19,490 --> 01:07:20,360
Rym: You didn't get to do it.

1197
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:23,146
Scott: You buy a big building in Puerto Rico, all it does is give you points.

1198
01:07:23,995 --> 01:07:28,139
Scott: It's like it's not a big, you know, but you get a university, which is like the biggest building that can do something.

1199
01:07:28,503 --> 01:07:31,440
Scott: And you'll get, you can get that and use it.

1200
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:34,359
Scott: You can get the wharf in Puerto Rico and use it.

1201
01:07:34,962 --> 01:07:38,074
Scott: You can get it, you know, 50, 60% of the way into the game.

1202
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:42,886
Rym: Well, that little machine game we were playing, the game where you pump stuff through your factories.

1203
01:07:43,755 --> 01:07:44,240
Rym: The card game.

1204
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:45,651
Rym: You played it at PAX.

1205
01:07:45,833 --> 01:07:46,300
Scott: I don't remember.

1206
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:48,280
Rym: You bought it, or I bought it, one of us bought it.

1207
01:07:48,704 --> 01:07:50,240
Scott: Oh, um, oh my goods.

1208
01:07:50,420 --> 01:07:57,699
Rym: Yes, that game has a good mechanic where when the game ends, you know, you've built your machine of like all your different buildings out there doing shit.

1209
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:01,493
Rym: At the end of the game, you get to crank your whole machine a bunch of times.

1210
01:08:01,715 --> 01:08:08,847
Rym: So you've built the crazy building at the end, you get to use it like multiple times at the end of the game, rewarding you for having it.

1211
01:08:09,392 --> 01:08:11,260
Rym: Like, there's ways to get around that problem.

1212
01:08:12,203 --> 01:08:29,979
Scott: Whenever the biggest, the biggest, funnest, most awesome, powerful thing there is in your game, players should be able to get that thing, if they play well, obviously, right, with at least 20% of the game remaining, so that they can actually use it a bit and have a bunch of fun with it, and then the game should end.

1213
01:08:30,403 --> 01:08:32,604
Scott: not, you know, you don't want to give it to them too early.

1214
01:08:32,624 --> 01:08:36,460
Scott: If you get that stuff halfway through the game, then it's like, oh my god, why isn't it over yet, right?

1215
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:36,862
Scott: Yeah.

1216
01:08:36,902 --> 01:08:47,417
Scott: But like, with 20% or less of the game remaining, you should be able to get the biggest, strongest, most fun thing, and use it three, two to four times.

1217
01:08:48,321 --> 01:08:51,654
Scott: Get some uses out of it as the finishing blow.

1218
01:08:51,674 --> 01:08:51,755
Scott: Yeah.

1219
01:08:52,562 --> 01:08:52,804
Scott: Right?

1220
01:08:53,148 --> 01:08:56,845
Scott: That, you know, this game, it's like, you could never get the most powerful level stuff.

1221
01:08:56,865 --> 01:08:58,420
Scott: You know what they could have done to make that better?

1222
01:08:58,923 --> 01:09:01,147
Scott: Just remove that top level of powerful stuff.

1223
01:09:01,188 --> 01:09:07,840
Scott: Just not have it in the game, and that way, the funnest, most powerful stuff is stuff that's, you know, gettable, right?

1224
01:09:08,523 --> 01:09:22,120
Scott: It's like, just cut away your top level, and now make the second to top level the top level, and that will now become, simply because it's at the top of your tech tree, like, you play Civ V, you can't actually get and use XCOM dudes, right?

1225
01:09:22,441 --> 01:09:24,459
Rym: I have used them in long wars.

1226
01:09:25,225 --> 01:09:27,532
Scott: Only if you continue after the game ends.

1227
01:09:27,633 --> 01:09:27,917
Scott: No!

1228
01:09:29,122 --> 01:09:32,099
Rym: I've used them in long wars to win the game.

1229
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:34,825
Scott: I've never gotten XCOM dudes before the timer was up.

1230
01:09:34,845 --> 01:09:35,613
Scott: I have, Scott,

1231
01:09:35,875 --> 01:09:51,408
Rym: I had a fleet once of a bunch of XCOM dudes, and not one, but two giant death robots, and I used those to take out a bunch of cities from a civilization that was close to a culture victory so that I could then get a science victory.

1232
01:09:51,428 --> 01:09:53,933
Scott: Well, obviously you were having a science victory already.

1233
01:09:53,953 --> 01:10:00,620
Rym: The thing is, I could have just taken out his capital and had the domination victory, but I was sick of always getting domination victory.

1234
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:04,865
Scott: Right, but I mean, you know, whatever your top level of stuff is should come into play before the end of the game.

1235
01:10:05,210 --> 01:10:11,125
Rym: Yeah, but anyway, I mean, we didn't play the game enough to give you, like, a deeper review than that, but suffice it to say...

1236
01:10:11,206 --> 01:10:13,325
Scott: Unless you like being punished, right?

1237
01:10:13,427 --> 01:10:13,877
Scott: Don't play this.

1238
01:10:15,224 --> 01:10:21,313
Rym: Or, if you like games like Twilight Struggle, that are serious, luck-free, long...

1239
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:23,359
Scott: Twilight Struggle has some luck.

1240
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:29,690
Rym: Yeah, but heavy analysis requires significant investment in that specific game, as opposed to games in general.

1241
01:10:29,710 --> 01:10:33,165
Rym: I can think of a lot of kinds of people who would really like this game.

1242
01:10:33,185 --> 01:10:33,932
Rym: Sure.

1243
01:10:34,054 --> 01:10:35,253
Rym: I am not one of those people.

1244
01:10:35,356 --> 01:10:35,499
Scott: No.

1245
01:10:41,631 --> 01:10:43,770
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1246
01:10:43,930 --> 01:10:49,102
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1247
01:10:49,283 --> 01:10:54,334
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1248
01:10:54,576 --> 01:10:57,262
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1249
01:10:57,383 --> 01:11:01,888
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1250

Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1251
01:11:06,810 --> 01:11:09,850
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1252
01:11:10,050 --> 01:11:12,990
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1253
01:11:30,280 --> 01:12:15,027
Rym: The Patrons for this episode of GeekNights who are paying at least $5 a month in order of the amount of money they give us on a continuing basis are Finn, Eric, Silveron, and the Infinite Sadness, Kinetic Man, Aaron, Cerise, Chris Midkiff, Chris Knox, A Red Lion, Sam Corddry, Daniel Redman, Chris Hadad, Sean Klein, Chris Reimer, and Thomas Hahn.

1254
01:12:15,047 --> 01:12:21,594
Rym: I know we had a long outage between PAX and me having the flu, and then me being in Hong Kong and Australia.

1255
01:12:21,917 --> 01:12:28,180
Rym: I recorded a bunch of Rym's Rants, but I didn't have any bandwidth in Australia, and Patreon doesn't work so well in Australia.

1256
01:12:28,621 --> 01:12:30,686
Rym: So I'm going to be uploading those over the course of the next couple weeks.

1257
01:12:31,333 --> 01:12:36,460
Rym: You'll also get the March, or the April Q&A from me and Scott.

1258
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:39,718
Rym: The May one is still taking questions for another week and a half or so.

1259
01:12:40,220 --> 01:12:43,394
Rym: And remember, the theme for May is something Scott will hate.

1260
01:12:43,858 --> 01:12:44,645
Rym: It's politics.

1261
01:12:45,049 --> 01:12:47,900
Rym: But we're back for bed, and now I leave you with something weird.

1262
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:49,182
Rym: - My ding-a-ling!

1263
01:12:49,202 --> 01:12:51,385
Scott: - This act is over!
