00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,020
Rym: It's Thursday May 26th 2016.

2
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:15,790
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:16,152 --> 00:00:17,058
Rym: Jurassic Park.

4
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:23,686
Rym: from memory mostly bad memory Let's do this.

5
00:00:26,281 --> 00:00:30,368
Rym: So yesterday someone straight-up threatened to kill me all right.

6
00:00:30,408 --> 00:00:31,089
Scott: Did they succeed?

7
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:31,149
Scott: ah?

8
00:00:32,442 --> 00:00:32,873
Rym: Don't think so.

9
00:00:34,643 --> 00:00:42,799
Rym: And the way I normally go to get to Broadway like after I come over the Williamsburg bridge is Just like the road is closed and There's construction or some nonsense.

10
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,784
Rym: I have to turn left, so I turn left And then I gotta go up a bit And then there's a side street, and there is a bike lane on that side street.

11
00:00:50,086 --> 00:01:06,970
Rym: that bike lane is 100% full of construction equipment, so I rode in the regular lane And I come up to a stop sign and I stop and then a car behind me stops and the guy Literally like leans out his window and yells what the fuck you stopping for?

12
00:01:07,975 --> 00:01:11,934
Rym: So I ignore him, and he's like don't you ignore me I'll fucking kill you.

13
00:01:11,954 --> 00:01:16,570
Rym: and then he revs his engine and then his car stalled mm-hmm, and I just bucked away.

14
00:01:17,394 --> 00:01:42,830
Rym: It was just like really shabby looking angry, dude And his really shabby angry looking friends that next to him smoking a cigar and the guy next to him Had that look you know you see sometimes were like like there's a there's someone who's stupid Causing a situation and there's their slightly less stupid friend who realizes that what the person's doing Could get them in trouble and is really trying to like back them out of it without getting involved.

15
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:45,790
Rym: Hmm, so yeah, that was that was my experience.

16
00:01:46,393 --> 00:01:55,010
Scott: I was biking yesterday because I wisely unlike some people who are not wise Checked the weather and saw that yesterday was gonna be 80 and sunny and today it didn't happen.

17
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:56,054
Scott: But there was chance of rain.

18
00:01:56,094 --> 00:01:57,178
Scott: today the weather change got.

19
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:02,460
Rym: chance of rain means I bike to work unless it's actually Raining when I leave for work.

20
00:02:02,681 --> 00:02:03,183
Rym: I'm gonna go to.

21
00:02:03,204 --> 00:02:07,990
Scott: the point is yesterday was the first day Finally guaranteed 80 degrees and sunny, so I just didn't go to work.

22
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:08,652
Rym: I know what.

23
00:02:08,794 --> 00:02:16,092
Rym: I'm glad I went to work because for various reasons you don't write lunch yesterday Nobu that like super famous sushi place downtown Mmm.

24
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:17,298
Rym: I like a $200 lunch.

25
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:17,701
Rym: It was great.

26
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,330
Scott: There was a free lunch at my work yesterday, too.

27
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,236
Rym: Was it like ultra fancy sushi?

28
00:02:21,256 --> 00:02:23,424
Scott: It was ultra fancy Italian.

29
00:02:23,464 --> 00:02:25,974
Scott: I guess our Mexican or something I don't fucking know.

30
00:02:26,014 --> 00:02:27,722
Scott: I don't care anyway anyway.

31
00:02:27,903 --> 00:02:28,968
Scott: It was catering from this place.

32
00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:34,750
Scott: Whatever And I was making a left to go to Astoria Park, and I'm stopped.

33
00:02:34,994 --> 00:02:38,721
Scott: There's a green light But I'm waiting to go left and this car is just coming non-stop.

34
00:02:38,761 --> 00:02:42,580
Scott: so I can't go left and just waiting up as a car Behind me and they honk at me.

35
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,270
Scott: It's like what do you want me to do so?

36
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,201
Scott: I ignore them and they honk again, so I ignored them.

37
00:02:47,723 --> 00:02:49,250
Rym: see it's it's and then I turned left.

38
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:51,290
Rym: It's this thing that I try to suppress.

39
00:02:51,611 --> 00:02:58,574
Rym: But if someone honks at me more than passingly my brain says just you know you know that bike Finger The finger is making a move and I was like finger.

40
00:02:58,594 --> 00:02:59,477
Rym: there's no reason to move.

41
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:07,722
Rym: Yeah, I try to not do it because pretty much.

42
00:03:08,143 --> 00:03:10,390
Rym: It's unit satisfying because you're like all right.

43
00:03:10,651 --> 00:03:16,282
Rym: I told that I expressed to this person who's obviously too dumb to realize it that yes I hear you and no I don't care that you're honking.

44
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:20,439
Rym: That's right, but at the same time sometimes It's I will fucking kill you shabby man.

45
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,263
Rym: That's right.

46
00:03:21,303 --> 00:03:22,909
Scott: Don't get yourself involved with that first.

47
00:03:22,929 --> 00:03:23,170
Scott: yep.

48
00:03:23,552 --> 00:03:30,865
Rym: So usually I only do the finger if I'm already moving But not if I'm stopped in a place where I can't just keep going.

49
00:03:30,885 --> 00:03:32,091
Scott: listen in New York There's.

50
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:32,452
Scott: you know that.

51
00:03:32,653 --> 00:03:35,442
Scott: you know there's that spirit that travels around the city.

52
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:37,790
Scott: that just makes everyone's finger like real easy to move.

53
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:41,030
Rym: Oh my god is than usual my that thing like it is like it.

54
00:03:41,231 --> 00:03:42,275
Rym: I don't even think about like.

55
00:03:42,335 --> 00:03:49,165
Rym: literally when I flip someone off like when I'm biking finger just came out just now Even thinking about the.

56
00:03:49,226 --> 00:03:54,738
Rym: you know I'll kill you guy cuz I'm pretty sure I flipped him off as I biked away But I don't really remember.

57
00:03:54,779 --> 00:03:56,569
Rym: I just assume I did cuz I feel like I did.

58
00:03:57,554 --> 00:03:57,879
Rym: It's an end.

59
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:58,610
Rym: It's like a reflex.

60
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:02,370
Rym: It's like if you get hit in the knee and your foot goes up someone honks finger comes out.

61
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,963
Scott: Yeah, but that the new bike path on that bridge.

62
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:06,289
Rym: Oh my god the Pulaski.

63
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:12,422
Scott: Yeah, so I go and I'm like oh, I'm biking that way and I'm like I'm so excited I'm gonna use this new path and I cheated.

64
00:04:12,482 --> 00:04:13,690
Rym: I wrote on it before it was done.

65
00:04:13,891 --> 00:04:18,550
Scott: I see I saw two people and they they got off their bikes were walking on the pedestrian path.

66
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,158
Scott: I'm like what the fuck is wrong with those people.

67
00:04:20,317 --> 00:04:28,529
Rym: Yeah, I saw I saw a woman fucking Biking in the pedestrian path and everyone was yelling at her and she was like getting really flustered.

68
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:29,392
Rym: good I like.

69
00:04:29,773 --> 00:04:36,256
Rym: I don't know if she just was too dumb to realize there's a tool as I start biking up the hill Right on the nice path.

70
00:04:36,697 --> 00:04:41,290
Scott: Ah, yeah, I see the two people who are walking like throwing their bikes over the barrier.

71
00:04:42,213 --> 00:04:59,130
Rym: So I've noticed that because people coming from Brooklyn if cuz if you come in that way if you bike that way a lot like Commuting the way to get on the bike path coming back into Queens is Actually like in a weird place and if you don't know it kind of looks like if you go that way You're just gonna be on the road going the wrong direction.

72
00:04:59,511 --> 00:05:02,122
Rym: So I can see why someone would miss it the first bike in the city.

73
00:05:02,142 --> 00:05:04,149
Scott: Why are you not paying attention to biking news?

74
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:07,738
Rym: You know what much like how.

75
00:05:08,019 --> 00:05:11,110
Rym: you know, if you're playing a video game, how can we not pay attention video game news?

76
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:11,832
Scott: That's right.

77
00:05:11,872 --> 00:05:12,434
Scott: Why aren't you?

78
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:15,989
Rym: I knew that overwatch was coming just because that's a video game.

79
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,999
Scott: It's been at PAX for like two years.

80
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:20,330
Rym: Yeah, I know that PAX exists.

81
00:05:20,751 --> 00:05:25,970
Rym: I know that Otakon exists, but you know what most anime fans who live in Baltimore have never heard of Otakon.

82
00:05:26,512 --> 00:05:29,220
Rym: So that's the same thing most bikers in New York.

83
00:05:29,441 --> 00:05:30,946
Rym: They've not heard of gears Scott?

84
00:05:31,187 --> 00:05:34,850
Rym: if they haven't heard of gears Do you think they're gonna know about the Pulaski bike path plans?

85
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:41,138
Scott: I'm saying is if you're not paying attention to the things in life that matter to you then you're basic And we're gonna do a show on that.

86
00:05:41,158 --> 00:05:45,508
Rym: but then you didn't want to because it was gonna be condescending Because you're the one who condescends me.

87
00:05:47,034 --> 00:05:57,556
Rym: So you do not feel you did not feel Somewhat condescending toward the people who are walking their bikes on the pedestrian path and then threw them over the barrier Because you know everything we just talked about.

88
00:05:57,576 --> 00:06:04,013
Rym: no, you don't feel any amount of that like really no - I feel Pity.

89
00:06:04,816 --> 00:06:05,839
Rym: All right, so pity.

90
00:06:05,859 --> 00:06:18,796
Rym: pity could be argued to be somewhat condescending because Things pity only comes in two situations one eat you're in an equal situation to someone else, but they suffer Unrelated tragedy or two.

91
00:06:19,237 --> 00:06:23,630
Rym: someone is slightly less able than you to live their life a normal way.

92
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:24,472
Scott: No They've suffered.

93
00:06:24,492 --> 00:06:30,310
Scott: they've suffered a tragedy and that their upbringing did not turn them into a person who pays attention to things.

94
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:31,053
Rym: So you don't?

95
00:06:31,173 --> 00:06:35,130
Rym: you don't feel that there is any amount of condescension whatsoever.

96
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:40,616
Scott: I'm sorry that these and sad that these people grew up in a way That they don't know how to Google.

97
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:46,542
Rym: so at work actually funnily enough We're sitting around and I was like something something something.

98
00:06:46,562 --> 00:06:53,490
Rym: the W train because I was you know Because I know and nobody knew and everyone's like W is the one guy's like is there a W train?

99
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:56,147
Scott: And the other guys are not even knowing there was a W train.

100
00:06:56,228 --> 00:06:58,741
Rym: Yeah So then I live in here.

101
00:06:58,942 --> 00:07:10,298
Rym: so I started explaining like yeah You know the second Avenue subway and they're like second Avenue subway and I'm like, uh, the giant digga digga digga digga What are they gonna call it like?

102
00:07:10,902 --> 00:07:12,050
Rym: what what a number is left.

103
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,439
Rym: I was like it's easy and they're like, how do you know that?

104
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,925
Rym: and I was like the internet.

105
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,491
Rym: not even I was like Cuz.

106
00:07:17,632 --> 00:07:19,057
Rym: I know thing cuz.

107
00:07:19,078 --> 00:07:25,830
Rym: I've been to Second Avenue at some point in the past X years Even though for me, the reason is I've actually been following the progress.

108
00:07:28,492 --> 00:07:29,677
Scott: But I read the new.

109
00:07:29,697 --> 00:07:36,630
Scott: you could read even even if you read the New York fucking post Right the raggiest of rags not even fit for toilet paper.

110
00:07:37,574 --> 00:07:38,860
Scott: You would know this information.

111
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:40,990
Rym: you would know that a second Avenue subway is coming.

112
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,870
Rym: You would not know like the color the details.

113
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:48,610
Scott: You would know that it was probably the t-train and you'd probably also know the W train was coming back.

114
00:07:48,811 --> 00:07:50,439
Rym: It's gonna use BMT cars and like.

115
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,370
Rym: I know but crazy stuff, but sure.

116
00:07:52,711 --> 00:07:55,483
Scott: Well, I mean if the Q train is going on it has to use BMT cars.

117
00:07:55,544 --> 00:08:06,377
Rym: Yep, but so then You called the queue because it goes to Queens and I was like, well no I guess I seven goes to Queens.

118
00:08:06,417 --> 00:08:07,099
Scott: What is that?

119
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,707
Scott: Is it because there's seven somethings in Queens?

120
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:12,179
Rym: Oh So I saw a guy today.

121
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:13,669
Rym: This is totally unrelated, right?

122
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,462
Rym: So, you know how there's Mets themed city bikes around.

123
00:08:16,522 --> 00:08:18,130
Rym: now like some city bikes are Mets named.

124
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,816
Scott: Yeah, cuz the city is Citi Field.

125
00:08:19,996 --> 00:08:20,578
Rym: Yeah.

126
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:22,384
Rym: Yeah, so there was a. there was.

127
00:08:22,485 --> 00:08:24,251
Rym: I could see a guy go over to get a city Bike.

128
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:33,101
Rym: there's a. there's two Mets ones and one non Mets one and he goes and tries to take the non Mets one But then it's broken and he looked at the Mets ones and then he just walked away.

129
00:08:33,121 --> 00:08:34,625
Scott: Is he Yankees fan?

130
00:08:34,905 --> 00:08:35,648
Rym: I assume so.

131
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:38,679
Rym: Yeah See you got any news on this news day.

132
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,890
Scott: Yeah, let's go ski go with our New York news here.

133
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:44,704
Scott: So the police department and the fire department have charity.

134
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:46,170
Rym: Oh, I know what you're talking about.

135
00:08:46,311 --> 00:08:49,410
Scott: They often have charity sporting events where they compete against you.

136
00:08:49,651 --> 00:08:50,113
Scott: You were you were.

137
00:08:50,153 --> 00:08:52,743
Rym: you were suspecting that this is the kind of story room wouldn't know about.

138
00:08:52,763 --> 00:08:54,089
Rym: this was far front page FARC.

139
00:08:56,012 --> 00:09:00,999
Scott: It does seem like a FARC story And far it does seem like a FARC story.

140
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,686
Scott: So they've have charity sporting events.

141
00:09:02,786 --> 00:09:05,718
Scott: very very often They'll even play ice hockey against each other.

142
00:09:05,738 --> 00:09:12,270
Scott: Yeah, right and for charity, right you buy tickets You cheer for the fire department and they lose usually, right?

143
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:17,590
Scott: So they had a football game recently, which is weird because it's way not football season.

144
00:09:17,912 --> 00:09:27,276
Scott: But I guess this is the time of the year that you can find a football field That's not being used to like at a college or something right in the city because there aren't that many in New York City think Like Columbia has one.

145
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,549
Scott: maybe I don't even know where this took place.

146
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:34,110
Rym: Yeah, the thing is though, you can't use high school fields cuz MCU Park in Coney Island is where they had.

147
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:36,870
Scott: I think that's where the minor league baseball team play, whatever.

148
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:41,790
Rym: Anyway, the Midwest right around now is when the football fields are all taken over by the marching bands for the next year's programs.

149
00:09:42,153 --> 00:09:53,261
Scott: so they had the charity football game and As I as I said before most people cheer for the fire department and the cops win And the cops are running up the score or something.

150
00:09:53,282 --> 00:09:59,830
Scott: and then like you do yep And the police were deleting 29 to 13, which actually isn't running off score.

151
00:09:59,971 --> 00:10:01,418
Rym: That's that's a winnable game.

152
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:03,790
Rym: if there's more than like well, it's left on the clock.

153
00:10:03,851 --> 00:10:08,724
Scott: I don't think there was that much time left But the game ended in some kind of crazy brawl.

154
00:10:08,764 --> 00:10:10,210
Scott: that of course the cops started.

155
00:10:10,931 --> 00:10:15,030
Rym: Yeah, but like the pictures I saw the cops start a brawl when they were winning.

156
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:16,284
Rym: You know what?

157
00:10:16,345 --> 00:10:16,749
Rym: It's just that.

158
00:10:18,455 --> 00:10:19,448
Scott: And that's how cops do?

159
00:10:20,861 --> 00:10:24,298
Scott: I think also the Police are generally just like upset.

160
00:10:24,398 --> 00:10:26,386
Scott: the people root for the fire department and hate them.

161
00:10:26,467 --> 00:10:29,302
Scott: and it's like well This is this is fucking why I mean.

162
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:30,690
Rym: part of it is that I mean I grew up.

163
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,961
Rym: You know, my dad was a fireman.

164
00:10:32,203 --> 00:10:33,050
Rym: His dad was a fireman.

165
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:56,302
Rym: I grew up around a lot of firemen and also some cops but the perception because remember this is Detroit like shitty parts of town When the cops show up Usually there's trouble for some of the people who are involved but when the firemen show up, they don't give a shit about the drugs or The fight or whatever happened up to the point where the fire started.

166
00:10:56,603 --> 00:10:59,010
Rym: They only care about stopping the fire.

167
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,542
Scott: I think what is is a fire if firemen show up, right?

168
00:11:01,944 --> 00:11:03,049
Scott: They're only there to help you.

169
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,534
Scott: Yeah, regardless of who you are.

170
00:11:04,995 --> 00:11:05,998
Rym: There's no possibility.

171
00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:09,790
Rym: The fireman is gonna show up and like set another house on right.

172
00:11:09,911 --> 00:11:13,530
Scott: They don't care if you're black or you're old or you're white.

173
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:20,252
Scott: I mean there might be some problems like getting to your house if you live in a shitty area has bad fire service because Society.

174
00:11:20,332 --> 00:11:26,750
Scott: Yeah, but the firemen want to get the fire, you know people themselves once they're there, right?

175
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:28,838
Scott: They only help people wherever they go.

176
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:29,621
Scott: They don't do it.

177
00:11:29,641 --> 00:11:30,444
Scott: They don't hurt people.

178
00:11:30,525 --> 00:11:31,187
Rym: come on a cop.

179
00:11:31,248 --> 00:11:31,810
Rym: It's 50/50.

180
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:35,390
Scott: Sometimes they hurt people and sometimes they help people.

181
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:38,470
Rym: I called the cop because there's that homeless guy.

182
00:11:39,631 --> 00:11:44,350
Scott: There's a lot of times when you ask him to help you and they fucking won't like hey my bike is stolen.

183
00:11:44,591 --> 00:11:45,536
Scott: Here's where it is.

184
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:47,949
Scott: Come and take it back from this thief for me.

185
00:11:48,532 --> 00:11:50,944
Scott: I don't even need you to arrest them and they just say no.

186
00:11:51,245 --> 00:12:03,671
Scott: Yeah, I'm not gonna Happen to a friend of ours literally here and then when there's a football game They start a fight with the fire department that you like so fuck you cops there You know what?

187
00:12:03,691 --> 00:12:06,580
Rym: The only thing that would make this great is there's no song.

188
00:12:06,881 --> 00:12:08,004
Scott: fuck the fire department.

189
00:12:08,726 --> 00:12:09,709
Scott: No one ever sang that.

190
00:12:13,431 --> 00:12:14,514
Scott: You ever hear such a song?

191
00:12:14,594 --> 00:12:15,076
Rym: I haven't.

192
00:12:15,998 --> 00:12:19,869
Scott: I don't foresee anyone writing it or rapping it anytime in the near future either.

193
00:12:21,892 --> 00:12:25,290
Rym: So I had a news but Scott stole it to be his thing of the day.

194
00:12:25,491 --> 00:12:26,015
Scott: Why was your?

195
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,269
Scott: why was your news thing of the day worthy?

196
00:12:28,451 --> 00:12:33,181
Rym: Because I had a lot more Semi-series talk about it, but it is also funny.

197
00:12:33,463 --> 00:12:35,190
Rym: So instead I'll also go with the New York news.

198
00:12:35,772 --> 00:12:43,974
Rym: so New York City, like all cities has a typical problem of people piss everywhere and They drink in public.

199
00:12:44,175 --> 00:12:45,681
Scott: that is not a problem of all cities.

200
00:12:45,741 --> 00:12:46,424
Rym: Well, no, it's not.

201
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:53,670
Rym: it's a because for example Well, yeah, but also Australia like it's not illegal to have alcohol outside.

202
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:58,115
Rym: In fact in most of the world Like especially in Europe Like if you're somewhere you're gonna

203
00:12:58,135 --> 00:13:02,197
Scott: have alcohol outside in New York as long as you're in like the seating area of a place of The license,

204
00:13:02,543 --> 00:13:05,319
Rym: uh, yeah but you can't just like drink a beer walking down the street.

205
00:13:05,821 --> 00:13:07,949
Rym: or if you're black drink a beer in Central Park.

206
00:13:07,969 --> 00:13:10,289
Rym: or Do you see that study where they?

207
00:13:11,873 --> 00:13:16,670
Rym: Well, but like if white people drink wine in Central Park cops will there.

208
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:21,406
Rym: I don't think there's ever been a citation for a white person drinking in Central Park.

209
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:22,610
Rym: I was watching homeless.

210
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:29,499
Scott: I was watching some Korean TV and some Korean celebrities had a picnic in Central Park as they're visiting, New York Yeah, and they busted out the wine.

211
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,289
Scott: and I'm like, whoa, they're just showing this on TV.

212
00:13:31,712 --> 00:13:32,758
Scott: They don't know do they?

213
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,004
Scott: and nothing happened to them?

214
00:13:34,045 --> 00:13:35,272
Rym: Yeah, because there was Mr.

215
00:13:35,312 --> 00:13:35,855
Rym: Walig.

216
00:13:35,956 --> 00:13:37,847
Scott: they were very white colored.

217
00:13:37,867 --> 00:13:44,605
Rym: Yeah No, the car it's not even minor It's just black people or homeless people get written up for it and no one else does.

218
00:13:44,806 --> 00:13:45,287
Rym: pretty much.

219
00:13:45,327 --> 00:13:46,050
Rym: That's how it goes.

220
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:51,950
Scott: I mean the law was created as you know, because you can't make a law that says arrest anyone who's homeless or blacks.

221
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:58,750
Scott: You make a law that says arrest anyone who does this thing and then you just only enforce it against people who are black or homeless.

222
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:09,670
Rym: but this is an interesting thing here because it it's a uniquely American problem of stopping people from drinking in public and I kind of Wish we just you know act like the rest of the world and grow up a little bit on it.

223
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:13,250
Scott: Well, I mean, but you know alcohol is becoming a bigger problem every year.

224
00:14:13,391 --> 00:14:16,928
Scott: So I feel like it is but we need to do many things, too.

225
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:27,970
Rym: but at the same time the problem that it is is Correlated very tightly except for a few exceptions except for a few exceptions except for a few special cases.

226
00:14:28,692 --> 00:14:30,476
Rym: It's mostly poorer people like.

227
00:14:30,496 --> 00:14:32,140
Rym: there's deeper societal problems.

228
00:14:32,301 --> 00:14:34,626
Rym: Alcohol is the one of the symptoms.

229
00:14:34,947 --> 00:14:36,130
Rym: It's not its own cause.

230
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:44,145
Scott: I think you know, we already discussed on the on the forum the solution of banning alcohol advertising which is a great idea, but I actually thought of another great idea and we should cuz.

231
00:14:44,406 --> 00:14:46,012
Scott: you know, there's the The.

232
00:14:46,334 --> 00:14:47,017
Scott: you know, what's it?

233
00:14:47,057 --> 00:14:50,089
Scott: tobacco and fire alcohol firearms, what's the name of the stupid?

234
00:14:51,111 --> 00:14:53,920
Rym: ATF right all tobacco firearms, right?

235
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:58,740
Scott: They they say, you know, these cigarettes are okay These ones aren't these guns are okay.

236
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,424
Scott: These ones aren't.

237
00:14:59,504 --> 00:15:01,152
Scott: these alcohols are okay These ones aren't.

238
00:15:01,594 --> 00:15:12,330
Scott: they could if they wanted to much like the FCC does right say These beers and wines are okay, and those ones aren't and effectively outlaw all the cheap alcohol.

239
00:15:12,691 --> 00:15:19,070
Scott: So they would basically only no more 40s no more Budweiser no more cores, right?

240
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:23,953
Scott: It's pretty much gonna be hipster beers only No more no more.

241
00:15:23,993 --> 00:15:30,270
Rym: Hope one could make an argument that that basically saying only yuppie white people get to drink out.

242
00:15:30,391 --> 00:15:33,630
Scott: No, cuz the yuppie white people are gonna lose their PBR to fuck them.

243
00:15:33,971 --> 00:15:37,770
Rym: Yeah, you know what the PBR thing is like a very specific cultural touchstone.

244
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:42,270
Rym: But most of those places people are drinking like Bellini's in the middle of the day.

245
00:15:43,091 --> 00:15:50,016
Scott: Sure, I'm saying we could outlaw all of the cheap alcohols Or just charge more for everything.

246
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:54,330
Scott: Yeah, cuz that totally stopped which effectively does no it effectively does the same thing.

247
00:15:54,471 --> 00:15:57,850
Scott: Nobody's going to drink the hobo wine if they have to pay 20 bucks.

248
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:58,191
Rym: It's got.

249
00:15:58,211 --> 00:16:02,650
Rym: Australia did it much better with cigarettes like no cigarette brands exist.

250
00:16:02,951 --> 00:16:05,483
Rym: Every cigarette pack looks the same which is the name of the company that made it.

251
00:16:05,523 --> 00:16:06,990
Scott: and how do you when you want to order?

252
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,980
Scott: When you want to buy some how do you choose which ones?

253
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,990
Rym: you say the name of the brand you want?

254
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:16,590
Rym: And there's a listing black and white that says all the names of the brands and how many dollars it costs for a pack.

255
00:16:17,253 --> 00:16:21,230
Rym: And you know what happened people only buy the cheapest one when there's no more branding.

256
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:28,857
Scott: And I thought that they you know, not that I've ever smoked but I was under the impression that they actually no They don't had different tastes.

257
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:30,950
Rym: Yeah, they do but smokers are just addicted.

258
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,256
Rym: They'll use whatever the cheapest one is.

259
00:16:32,296 --> 00:16:34,386
Rym: like all studies show that they don't give a shit.

260
00:16:34,507 --> 00:16:40,250
Rym: in practice At least people who are like that like people who go to a 7-eleven and buy a pack of cigarettes one at a time.

261
00:16:40,591 --> 00:16:41,553
Rym: Those people don't care.

262
00:16:41,874 --> 00:16:45,966
Scott: Let's go and make the cheapest cigarettes we can and sell them in Australia.

263
00:16:45,986 --> 00:16:52,284
Scott: So I'm in Australia and then After like we become the most popular poison the mall and kill every smoker in Australia.

264
00:16:52,304 --> 00:16:56,982
Rym: I Generally feel like murder is like there are some murder.

265
00:16:57,002 --> 00:16:57,986
Scott: They're killing themselves.

266
00:16:58,087 --> 00:16:58,930
Scott: We're just speeding it up.

267
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:00,862
Rym: It's still murder if you light it up.

268
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:02,029
Scott: They're the ones doing it.

269
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,257
Scott: We're not forcing them with.

270
00:17:03,297 --> 00:17:09,962
Rym: Moses name jumped out of the skyscraper To commit suicide and gogo 13 shot him on the way down.

271
00:17:10,282 --> 00:17:11,507
Rym: that was still murder.

272
00:17:11,587 --> 00:17:12,329
Scott: No shouldn't be.

273
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:21,189
Rym: Well Scott you're slowly dying just by existing in fact by living in New York right now with the air at the elevated air pollution Today, so I'll just speed it along.

274
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:30,167
Scott: Listen, if I could file a lawsuit against everyone making air pollution in the city, I would If I could have comedically farted right there, that would have been.

275
00:17:30,348 --> 00:17:40,501
Rym: but anyway To get back to my news public drinking and urination are no longer are going to be no longer Criminal offenses in New York City.

276
00:17:40,521 --> 00:17:41,629
Rym: They're gonna go into the civil courts.

277
00:17:42,451 --> 00:17:46,610
Rym: It's part of a collective set of bills called the next time I really got to go and there's no public bathroom.

278
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,614
Rym: I'm going so you can still get a ticket.

279
00:17:48,995 --> 00:17:53,033
Rym: but it's Criminal Justice Reform Act and It's already used for things.

280
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:55,860
Rym: Like if you ride a bike on the sidewalk or jump over a turnstile.

281
00:17:57,002 --> 00:17:57,585
Rym: It shifts.

282
00:17:57,685 --> 00:18:09,080
Rym: it shifts all these crimes to the civil court system and I would have actually kind of been against this because I'm really sick of like drunk people vomiting and pissing everywhere.

283
00:18:09,642 --> 00:18:12,511
Scott: I think vomiting the street should be unless you're unless you have a sickness.

284
00:18:13,013 --> 00:18:17,270
Scott: if you vomit because of alcohol on the street Right, then you should be in big trouble.

285
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:33,347
Rym: Yeah, and they're very clear this is just to undermine those broken windows laws because Specifically while broken windows might have been a noble idea in a perspective or a theory in practice It was only used to harass black people.

286
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:34,451
Scott: the broken windows.

287
00:18:34,491 --> 00:18:43,260
Scott: I thought was meant see originally the first time I ever heard about it I thought it meant Oh will power wash and paint all the houses on your street to psychologically and fix all the broken windows.

288
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:47,740
Scott: Psychologically the neighborhood will feel better and people will stop committing crimes.

289
00:18:48,462 --> 00:19:00,097
Rym: One minor component the general idea behind the broken windows laws was have very strict laws for behaviors that Correlate to crime like like if you like, you know minor crime, that's a bad part.

290
00:19:00,178 --> 00:19:01,547
Scott: Don't do that part Just do the first part.

291
00:19:01,567 --> 00:19:04,104
Rym: It was minor crimes like jaywalking Getting in public.

292
00:19:04,124 --> 00:19:05,630
Rym: do the part gun.

293
00:19:05,751 --> 00:19:08,080
Scott: just do the part that I talked about and not that other part.

294
00:19:08,181 --> 00:19:09,220
Rym: So just make the city nicer.

295
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:20,740
Rym: But anyway, regardless of intent regardless of you know, any reason why these laws were made in reality They were just used to harass black people in the Bronx and upper Manhattan.

296
00:19:21,643 --> 00:19:27,140
Rym: So this set of laws is saying because the criminal job and the analogy they use in here is pretty great.

297
00:19:27,521 --> 00:19:44,176
Rym: The criminal justice system is a giant hammer and a giant hammer is the worst possible tool to deal with nuisance crimes Because a giant hammer brings with it a lot of consequences and the outcomes tend to be a lot worse if you use a hammer And a giant hammer instead of a ball peen hammer.

298
00:19:44,196 --> 00:19:59,080
Rym: Sure So they're basically going to shuffle more things into the civil court system so that the civil court system Has a lot more discretion to deal with the people that are caught with these crimes on a case-by-case basis.

299
00:19:59,542 --> 00:20:27,100
Rym: they tried this before with turnstile jumping because turnstile jumping the Demographic of people who jump turnstiles in New York is pretty much poor minority kids and rather than like messing up their lives With the criminal justice system they get a ticket that if you go to a civil court and a civil judge can just talk to them and come to some Sort of accommodation and it basically Really really reduces the ability for police to use broken windows bullshit to harass minorities.

300
00:20:28,022 --> 00:20:29,489
Rym: So it's actually a pretty cool thing.

301
00:20:29,509 --> 00:20:31,298
Scott: that's happening on a tangent.

302
00:20:32,081 --> 00:20:36,796
Scott: Have you ever seen anyone use a ball peen hammer for a legitimate task?

303
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,848
Scott: I Don't know what.

304
00:20:39,929 --> 00:20:41,260
Scott: I've only ever used a regular hammer.

305
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,519
Scott: I've never needed a ball peen hammer when a regular hammer wouldn't get the job done.

306
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:50,060
Scott: I don't understand what the situation is where you need one and a regular hammer is not gonna get it.

307
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:55,700
Rym: So I'm about to look up what you're supposed to use the ball before but I had ball peen hammer.

308
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:01,219
Rym: I'd one ball peen hammer that my dad gave me when I was a kid But it was made out of a metal such that it would not spark.

309
00:21:01,943 --> 00:21:05,480
Rym: So I used it in situations where I was hitting metal and I did not want to create.

310
00:21:05,982 --> 00:21:09,320
Scott: But isn't a ball peen hammer like a ball at one end and not a flat surface?

311
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,649
Rym: Yeah, I never used the ball for anything.

312
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:11,860
Scott: Yeah, what's the ball part for?

313
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:12,862
Rym: I only use the peen.

314
00:21:12,882 --> 00:21:14,229
Scott: That's why it's a ball peen.

315
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,220
Scott: A peen is just a regular fucking hammer.

316
00:21:16,501 --> 00:21:17,163
Scott: Yeah, right.

317
00:21:17,203 --> 00:21:18,889
Scott: The ball is the part that I don't know.

318
00:21:18,909 --> 00:21:21,137
Rym: Ball peen, straight peen, cross peen.

319
00:21:21,558 --> 00:21:23,746
Scott: Let's see What's the ball part for?

320
00:21:23,766 --> 00:21:27,078
Rym: A ball peen hammer also spelled ball pine apparently.

321
00:21:27,139 --> 00:21:27,480
Scott: Whatever.

322
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,830
Rym: Also known as the machinist hammer is a type of peening hammer.

323
00:21:32,031 --> 00:21:32,492
Scott: What's peening?

324
00:21:32,512 --> 00:21:33,696
Rym: Used in metalworking.

325
00:21:33,856 --> 00:21:34,157
Scott: Sure.

326
00:21:34,378 --> 00:21:35,160
Rym: I'm gonna look up peening.

327
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:35,842
Rym: What's peening?

328
00:21:36,184 --> 00:21:37,550
Rym: Peening is the process.

329
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:40,020
Scott: The thing that you can do on the street without going to criminal court.

330
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:50,188
Rym: Working a metal surface to improve its material properties by mechanical means such as hammer blows or blasting it with shots shot peening.

331
00:21:50,773 --> 00:21:56,385
Rym: Shot peening is fucking shooting metal To like sandblasting.

332
00:21:56,426 --> 00:21:59,600
Scott: I've never seen a guy at like a forge use a ball peen hammer.

333
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,587
Scott: They usually use a big ass flat thing.

334
00:22:01,608 --> 00:22:02,993
Rym: Well, there's different processes.

335
00:22:03,093 --> 00:22:03,796
Rym: So yeah, there you go.

336
00:22:04,097 --> 00:22:04,398
Scott: Whatever.

337
00:22:04,438 --> 00:22:04,860
Rym: Metalworking.

338
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,724
Scott: I learned nothing.

339
00:22:05,784 --> 00:22:06,688
Rym: You don't metalwork.

340
00:22:06,748 --> 00:22:14,839
Rym: So the only time I ever did metalworking, I was metalworking I was working sheet metal over wood backing and I used a rubber mallet to do that.

341
00:22:20,154 --> 00:22:22,509
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

342
00:22:24,071 --> 00:22:29,654
Rym: So while vaporwave is not a thing like that is not actually a genre of music You don't think so?

343
00:22:29,835 --> 00:22:30,317
Rym: No, I don't think so.

344
00:22:30,377 --> 00:22:37,296
Scott: It seems like one of those situations where like, you know When you combine genres of music into a new combination That's never been combined before.

345
00:22:37,497 --> 00:22:40,167
Rym: Like for example bad music and metal becomes new metal.

346
00:22:40,829 --> 00:22:42,092
Scott: Sure Right.

347
00:22:42,312 --> 00:22:46,887
Scott: Does that actually count as a new genre or is it simply a combination of its parts?

348
00:22:46,947 --> 00:22:57,378
Scott: And if that's the case Shouldn't we just define all music based on like oh, that's you know, a cannon right use the original Right the oldest possible right because it's like.

349
00:22:57,739 --> 00:22:58,402
Scott: oh, that's just.

350
00:22:58,522 --> 00:23:01,273
Scott: you know, that metal song is just a cannon plus distortion We can't.

351
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:02,098
Scott: it's not a new thing.

352
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,910
Rym: Yeah, right, but there's two different kinds.

353
00:23:04,011 --> 00:23:07,050
Rym: Some things are just this plus this and some things do synthesize in their own thing.

354
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:43,466
Rym: But anyway, I decided and I'd fuck, you know, anyone else who has had an opinion on this in terms of like Wikipedia or academia or whatever I Decided that it makes more sense if you think of vaporwave as an aesthetic genre Like it's not a music genre But it's like someone took a bunch of aesthetic elements Combine them together and said if you make something that combines all of these elements in any way You're part of this like weird aesthetic genre or aesthetic movement and it's linked together solely by the components that were used to make it Which means chiptunes are basically that as well just broader.

355
00:23:43,486 --> 00:23:49,208
Rym: I Decided this because I found something fascinating The other day a while ago.

356
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:57,301
Rym: So and I legit like this music and I legit like this artistic movement, even though it's oddly specific But it's the same kind of thing as vaporwave.

357
00:23:57,783 --> 00:24:02,185
Rym: So I was watching a YouTube playlist that was just.

358
00:24:02,265 --> 00:24:03,190
Rym: it was like auto-generated.

359
00:24:03,551 --> 00:24:08,330
Rym: It was just clips from the Simpsons like two to five minute clips, and I was just watching this thing.

360
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:09,389
Rym: Well, I was working on something.

361
00:24:10,012 --> 00:24:20,209
Rym: so basically I was just like mainlining Simpsons like good Simpsons like seasons 5 through 11 and Suddenly one of them looks really distorted in VHS.

362
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:28,135
Rym: I'm like, oh this is probably shitty and then it distorts a bunch and then I'm about to like just hit dislike and skip to The next video.

363
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:38,289
Rym: and I rarely pushed his leg yeah, but I thought this was like bad like it looked almost like someone who's taken an old VHS tape like with tracking issues and Just put it on YouTube.

364
00:24:39,432 --> 00:24:47,142
Rym: but then some music starts and The video was edited cleverly to match the music.

365
00:24:47,443 --> 00:24:59,060
Rym: and then I realized that the VHS stuff was added in post on purpose and It was basically a music video and as I watch him like it was pretty cool.

366
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:06,590
Rym: So I liked it and then I noticed that all the recommendations after that Had the same title type thing.

367
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,580
Rym: This one was called feeling fine, you know vaporwave shit.

368
00:25:09,962 --> 00:25:13,080
Rym: They had like all the letters are capitalized and like spaced out.

369
00:25:14,825 --> 00:25:17,588
Rym: Every one of these videos was like that.

370
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:26,759
Rym: they all had Simpsons thumbnails and I start clicking on them and it was Simpson wave Mmm, and it was pretty good.

371
00:25:27,224 --> 00:25:28,560
Rym: But that wouldn't have been a thing.

372
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,202
Rym: It's like okay.

373
00:25:29,262 --> 00:25:36,362
Rym: someone was making fun of vaporwave and they made a bunch of videos and they called it Simpson wave and high production Value, but that's all they did.

374
00:25:36,903 --> 00:25:40,689
Rym: But then I noticed that these videos were all uploaded by different YouTube accounts.

375
00:25:40,709 --> 00:25:47,089
Rym: a ton of people were making Simpson wave like Two months ago this happened.

376
00:25:47,109 --> 00:25:55,293
Rym: These are all like from like March April May 2016. so I present to you the best of these.

377
00:25:55,635 --> 00:25:57,460
Rym: if you like this video or this music.

378
00:25:57,541 --> 00:25:59,880
Rym: Then you will actually legit like Simpson wave.

379
00:26:00,524 --> 00:26:05,888
Rym: Simpson wave is no less legit than vaporwave And I legit like this stuff.

380
00:26:06,048 --> 00:26:09,438
Scott: Like I'm not even like all sorts of weird internet shit like potato conditions.

381
00:26:09,598 --> 00:26:12,859
Rym: potato conditions I like because it's really kind of fucked up and dumb.

382
00:26:13,441 --> 00:26:14,404
Rym: But I like.

383
00:26:15,026 --> 00:26:18,856
Rym: I like this feeling fine and vaporwave for the same reasons.

384
00:26:18,896 --> 00:26:20,260
Rym: I like Neil Cisarenga's music.

385
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:20,882
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

386
00:26:20,902 --> 00:26:22,770
Scott: But Neil Cisarenga is like the borderline.

387
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:25,460
Scott: anything that goes beyond him is like nope too much internet.

388
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,503
Rym: This is at that level.

389
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:27,064
Rym: I think it's good.

390
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:32,680
Scott: Anyway, so there's this old TV show from back in the day called street sharks.

391
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:37,823
Scott: It was a cartoon for kids in the 90s that was trying to capitalize on Ninja Turtles.

392
00:26:37,843 --> 00:26:38,565
Rym: the right it was like.

393
00:26:38,726 --> 00:26:39,810
Rym: there was like.

394
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:43,426
Scott: there were a bunch of shows like this like swat cats and stuff Which is pretty much is like.

395
00:26:43,648 --> 00:26:44,615
Rym: so I guess is legit.

396
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:46,104
Scott: good though They're just like.

397
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:54,860
Scott: basically let's make animal people on a team Who fight in all sorts of action and getting weird scenarios against crazy bad guys that are weird.

398
00:26:55,182 --> 00:26:58,260
Scott: And it was all just pretty much Ninja Turtle clones of different animals.

399
00:26:58,541 --> 00:27:05,340
Rym: They were trying to trick grandma who knows you're into turtles that someone could be like, oh Or trick you into watching it, right?

400
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,913
Scott: so all these Ninja Turtle ripoff things basically from the 90s.

401
00:27:09,174 --> 00:27:13,871
Scott: street sharks is one of them and It was I guess slightly more popular than the others cuz like.

402
00:27:13,911 --> 00:27:19,092
Scott: I remember seeing these toys at at least one kid's house Yeah, and I vaguely remember the TV commercial.

403
00:27:19,192 --> 00:27:20,900
Rym: I might have watched the show, but I don't know.

404
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,268
Scott: I've definitely never watched an episode.

405
00:27:22,289 --> 00:27:27,089
Rym: I've definitely seen episodes of street sharks On the network I was watching.

406
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:31,488
Rym: it was on in the middle of the block of like all the other cartoons I was watching.

407
00:27:31,529 --> 00:27:38,858
Scott: it was one of those shows I definitely remember specifically seeing commercials for and knowing and seeing toys but not ever actually watching cuz man.

408
00:27:38,898 --> 00:27:39,600
Scott: that doesn't look good.

409
00:27:40,182 --> 00:27:44,500
Scott: Anyway, so there was a website called TV tome calm that I think no longer exists.

410
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:48,220
Rym: But this dude when I got bought by CBS or CBS bought it.

411
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:52,760
Scott: Anyway, this guy went to that website back in the day when it existed and for shits and giggles.

412
00:27:52,863 --> 00:27:53,397
Scott: It's like a wiki.

413
00:27:53,942 --> 00:27:59,990
Scott: he edited all the information about street sharks with fake nonsense and No one was paying attention to that.

414
00:28:00,152 --> 00:28:01,520
Scott: right three sharks, right?

415
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:07,946
Scott: No one's paying attention to this obscure ass show and he wrote things that sounded authoritative didn't sound unbelievable Right, it's around that.

416
00:28:08,006 --> 00:28:09,050
Rym: and like they're they shout.

417
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:10,135
Scott: they sounded true.

418
00:28:10,195 --> 00:28:11,199
Scott: they just weren't true.

419
00:28:12,141 --> 00:28:16,685
Rym: They're like they edge a little bit like they're just a tiny bit weird But they're not in like you.

420
00:28:16,745 --> 00:28:18,491
Rym: like one flag might go up like really.

421
00:28:18,511 --> 00:28:18,632
Scott: Mm-hmm.

422
00:28:19,434 --> 00:28:21,080
Rym: All right, I guess I guess this makes sense.

423
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:26,028
Scott: I guess that was an episode and I guess if you've actually seen the show and knew about it You would know that this stuff wasn't true.

424
00:28:26,189 --> 00:28:28,120
Rym: But but most people didn't watch the whole show.

425
00:28:28,241 --> 00:28:39,974
Rym: That's interesting even though the shows on Netflix now It's people like me who saw like some of it as a kid and they're like there was a character rocks and one of his Characters was Roxy and he'd be like rocks.

426
00:28:39,994 --> 00:28:41,320
Rym: Yeah, I guess there was a character like that.

427
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,323
Rym: I gotta remember that.

428
00:28:42,343 --> 00:28:45,212
Scott: so people basically he's created all this stuff.

429
00:28:45,252 --> 00:28:51,977
Scott: this like false history where people believe The things that he wrote are true because it was copied to so many other websites.

430
00:28:52,017 --> 00:28:58,779
Scott: this information right ended up as being like the source for so many other places and Apparently Wikipedia is correct.

431
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:10,276
Scott: But all these other places just used his in for his fake nonsense as a source for information and people believe this story He wrote like is the truth about this show and they don't realize that it's not.

432
00:29:10,296 --> 00:29:11,180
Rym: now think about this.

433
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:17,686
Rym: Like if you like randomly start googling after street sharks for some reason like say you have to write an article you work for some Like low-rent news organization.

434
00:29:17,706 --> 00:29:21,680
Rym: They're like give me an article on crappy cartoons in the 90s and you're like looking up street sharks.

435
00:29:22,221 --> 00:29:28,400
Rym: You'll find a page somewhere that talks about like the cool episodes or the lost episodes.

436
00:29:28,902 --> 00:29:41,920
Rym: It seems like these episodes nowadays mostly show up on websites where someone's saying hey I found this list of episodes that I can't find copies of But I know they happen because and he links to data from hit that

437
00:29:43,063 --> 00:29:47,215
Scott: There are people who will say things like they remember watching them when they're a kid and remember

438
00:29:47,235 --> 00:29:47,456
Rym: that

439
00:29:47,737 --> 00:29:48,519
Scott: false memories.

440
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:52,977
Scott: now There's people who are like I have a VHS tape of these and it's like no you don't.

441
00:29:53,078 --> 00:29:54,466
Rym: Yep No, you don't.

442
00:29:54,486 --> 00:29:55,795
Rym: there was a study a long time ago.

443
00:29:55,855 --> 00:29:56,580
Rym: I referenced this a lot.

444
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:09,385
Rym: I gotta find a link to it again because it was a great study but a company that they made up a fake brand of root beer that never existed and they would insert it into this long very detailed survey of like.

445
00:30:09,646 --> 00:30:11,813
Rym: what brands like what sodas did you drink as a kid?

446
00:30:12,455 --> 00:30:18,480
Rym: and a lot of people Remember drinking this soda that was literally made up at various eras.

447
00:30:18,741 --> 00:30:22,176
Rym: They would remember very specific details about this thing that never existed.

448
00:30:22,196 --> 00:30:25,549
Rym: Mm-hmm It's very easy to make this happen.

449
00:30:25,629 --> 00:30:28,539
Rym: And this article is just sort of like a fascinating look at someone who did it.

450
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:31,169
Scott: Yeah for all the more details read this article.

451
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:32,474
Scott: it's pretty interesting.

452
00:30:32,554 --> 00:30:34,000
Scott: and also don't watch street sharks.

453
00:30:34,381 --> 00:30:35,304
Rym: Yeah, you know what.

454
00:30:35,745 --> 00:30:37,490
Rym: watch one episode of street sharks.

455
00:30:37,952 --> 00:30:40,640
Scott: watch a clip of street sharks on YouTube if you must.

456
00:30:40,961 --> 00:30:42,046

00:30:46,748 --> 00:30:49,280
Rym: It is now going to be Oryx and Craig by Margaret Atwood.

461
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:57,953
Rym: we're not will tell you when we start reading it because the weather's nice and I'll read it in the park and Thor's hammer just got forged.

462
00:30:58,053 --> 00:31:14,976
Rym: in book 13 of the wheel of time Like straight up power forged weapon happens and some characters like I gotta give this thing a name and this character I'm trying to avoid some spoilers ask some other character in the old tongue What's a word for like soaring or flying and the guys like

Scott: There is oh I forgot to say I didn't forget actually I remember to send the ignites newsletter in what was last month April and then I just didn't because I couldn't think of anything to Write.

00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:07,320
Scott: Well, like we said we want to see me doing random nonsense in my apartment when I have nothing better to do.

499
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:11,560
Rym: The internet responds way better to people who are more prolific regardless of quality.

500
00:33:11,983 --> 00:33:14,800
Rym: We're not gonna lower our quality of like our main stuff like GeekNights.

503
00:33:21,698 --> 00:33:23,740

504
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,351
Scott: So you should check my youtube and it'll be.

505
00:33:26,632 --> 00:33:30,743

512
00:33:52,073 --> 00:33:53,242
Scott: it wasn't $40.

513
00:33:53,242 --> 00:33:59,394
Rym: So many people in the forum are playing it now too that You will be able to find good groups of people to play this game with.

514
00:34:00,016 --> 00:34:13,159
Rym: not gonna review it now But I will say this it is Like it's team as far as I've heard is Team Fortress 2 with more skills to twice as good less hats with a MOBA Aesthetic and with a lot of MOBA elements to it.

515
00:34:13,541 --> 00:34:20,928
Rym: But the skill cap of the FPS thing is three or four times higher than tf2 Like you but still way less than quick.

516
00:34:20,967 --> 00:34:22,252
Rym: It's like yeah, it's.

517
00:34:22,734 --> 00:34:31,400
Rym: it's like 20% as skill cappy as Weapons factory was for quick - and maybe 30 but it's still hard.

518
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:37,340
Scott: It's still more skills than tf2 way more skills than right, you know, so it's pretty fun and there's no pay to win.

519
00:34:37,521 --> 00:34:39,960
Scott: I mean I as far as I can tell it's it's a fine game.

520
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,833
Scott: I'm just not paying 40 bucks when I have more games.

521
00:34:41,895 --> 00:34:46,954
Rym: I know what to do with Yeah, but I'm gonna play it because the getting is good down and I'm never gonna.

522
00:34:46,995 --> 00:34:48,600

00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,679
Scott: I'm gonna go there and then come right home.

528
00:34:58,861 --> 00:35:00,586
Rym: So a long time ago.

529
00:35:00,606 --> 00:35:01,650
Rym: I was a kid.

530
00:35:02,493 --> 00:35:12,639
Rym: I saw Jurassic Park in the theater 1993 me too and I've like my 1993 brain like this was one of the greatest movies I had ever seen.

531
00:35:14,202 --> 00:35:16,755
Rym: No, not for me like it was up there.

532
00:35:16,775 --> 00:35:20,747
Rym: I mean it was With Indiana Jones.

533
00:35:20,787 --> 00:35:22,492
Scott: I mean, it wasn't like I hated Jurassic Park.

534
00:35:22,593 --> 00:35:23,094
Scott: I liked it.

535
00:35:23,375 --> 00:35:24,418
Scott: I enjoyed it, right?

536
00:35:24,538 --> 00:35:25,120
Scott: It was fine.

537
00:35:25,161 --> 00:35:26,540
Scott: I even had a VHS tape of it.

538
00:35:26,641 --> 00:35:30,407
Scott: I believe I watched it quite a few times But it wasn't like I was.

539
00:35:30,427 --> 00:35:32,413
Scott: I even read the first and second books.

540
00:35:32,694 --> 00:35:38,794
Rym: I read the first book like Real hardcore and thought a lot about the differences between the two.

541
00:35:38,814 --> 00:35:48,620
Scott: but like when I read that first book It was already the edition that was like, you know the movie but it was the real book But it had advertising on the cover that was like, you know based on the movie.

542
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,410
Scott: You know the movie was based on this whatever but it's like.

543
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:54,320
Scott: I liked it, but I wasn't like so into it.

544
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,372
Scott: It definitely was not at Star Wars level not easy.

545
00:35:56,392 --> 00:36:01,500
Scott: So what I read the book first I'm pretty sure I actually did read the book before seeing the movie.

546
00:36:01,561 --> 00:36:05,800
Scott: Yeah Right because that's that's the thing people don't realize because this doesn't happen anymore.

547
00:36:06,343 --> 00:36:08,960
Scott: That movie was in the theaters, right?

548
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,446
Scott: But not the dollar theater.

549
00:36:10,546 --> 00:36:20,300
Scott: it was in the main movie theater on at least one screen For perhaps at least a year since I saw it in the theater like three times during the original run, right?

550
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:23,590
Scott: It's like the original run of that in movie theaters lasted so long.

551
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:27,762
Scott: only that movie and Titanic were in movie theaters for such a long period of time.

552
00:36:27,783 --> 00:36:28,887
Scott: like even like.

553
00:36:28,907 --> 00:36:31,738
Scott: is Star Wars Episode 7 still in the theater now?

554
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:36,880
Scott: even I Fuck if I know like it maybe still is but it's like it's only been a couple months.

555
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:41,940
Scott: Imagine if that was still in the movie theater like next like like this holiday season.

556
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,809
Scott: It won't be right, but imagine it.

557
00:36:43,849 --> 00:36:52,155
Scott: that's Jurassic Park was in the theater for so long I saw it not when it just came out like I saw it months after it came out Like I had time to get the book read it.

558
00:36:52,255 --> 00:36:52,719
Scott: go see it.

559
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,731
Rym: Yep, see my mom gave me the book way before.

560
00:36:54,771 --> 00:36:56,220
Rym: cuz I you know, we're really in a Michael Crichton.

561
00:36:56,421 --> 00:36:58,868
Rym: Anyway, so I'd read a lot of Michael Crichton books.

562
00:36:59,209 --> 00:37:02,500
Rym: I wasn't actually you know what he wrote the Andromeda strain, right?

563
00:37:02,761 --> 00:37:03,486
Scott: I didn't read that one.

564
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:04,955
Scott: Uh, you know what I got to say.

565
00:37:04,975 --> 00:37:08,733
Scott: there wasn't you know Because he was way popular then right because of Jurassic Park.

566
00:37:08,773 --> 00:37:10,360
Scott: Yeah, he sort of had a surge in popularity.

567
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,986
Scott: They made movies based on his other books.

568
00:37:12,529 --> 00:37:14,336
Scott: I really like the movie sphere a lot.

569
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,592
Scott: Ah I don't people don't like that movie so much.

570
00:37:17,632 --> 00:37:19,060
Scott: it, you know, they'll probably just say it's okay.

571
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,473
Rym: Most people I know who really hate the movie.

572
00:37:21,513 --> 00:37:22,700
Rym: It's because they read the book.

573
00:37:23,162 --> 00:37:26,879
Scott: I don't think I read the book but really that that movie on its own is a thing that I like.

574
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:30,333
Scott: See, I remember I read the book like it more than I like Jurassic Park the movie.

575
00:37:30,695 --> 00:37:40,551
Rym: when I saw the movie I remember being really disappointed by it because the bullshit ending and because it really skipped a lot of the themes of the book maybe but I just like You know, it's mostly the thing I like most about.

576
00:37:40,631 --> 00:37:41,034
Scott: oh shit.

577
00:37:41,094 --> 00:37:42,000
Rym: I forgot about Congo.

578
00:37:42,201 --> 00:37:46,766
Rym: I read that and then I saw in the theater the thing I like most about Congo's got a real stupid end.

579
00:37:46,787 --> 00:37:48,232
Scott: the thing I like the most about spear.

580
00:37:48,252 --> 00:37:52,889
Scott: the movies like the atmosphere like they're in the bottom of The ocean and there's all the weird shit Scott.

581
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,816
Scott: It feels a lot like Stargate in some ways.

582
00:37:54,836 --> 00:37:56,803
Rym: you read the book then I haven't read the book.

583
00:37:56,844 --> 00:38:00,616
Rym: Maybe it's into a lot of things that the movie does not get into.

584
00:38:00,717 --> 00:38:01,339
Scott: maybe I should.

585
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,122
Rym: yeah You should.

586
00:38:02,222 --> 00:38:07,800
Scott: it's also got sort of an alien feel because they're like it's almost instead of being trapped in a ship They're trapped in this metal thing in the bottom of the seat, right?

587
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:08,520
Rym: Oh, you know what?

588
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:18,330
Rym: actually if all his books the one that I never read that I probably should is eaters of the dead because It's 13th warrior Never heard of it never seen the 13th warrior.

589
00:38:18,791 --> 00:38:20,456
Scott: No, what were the 12 other warriors?

590
00:38:20,817 --> 00:38:21,720
Rym: the 13th warriors?

591
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:22,284
Scott: It's all about.

592
00:38:22,304 --> 00:38:24,820
Scott: it were the 12 warriors the 12 monkeys and the 13th warriors.

593
00:38:25,061 --> 00:38:29,660
Rym: The 13th warrior is a movie that we're gonna talk about another day.

594
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:34,020
Rym: Okay, it is not a great movie, but it is a great movie.

595
00:38:34,361 --> 00:38:36,589
Rym: Okay, like you can enjoy the same.

596
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:38,677
Scott: it tastes good, but it tastes bad.

597
00:38:39,018 --> 00:38:41,402
Rym: It's like Commando.

598
00:38:41,543 --> 00:38:46,920
Rym: I love commando like in terms of the commandos at both a great movie and also a really kind of terrible movie.

599
00:38:47,201 --> 00:38:47,885
Scott: How is it terrible?

600
00:38:47,905 --> 00:38:48,468
Scott: in what way?

601
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:54,674
Rym: it's pretty cheesy How it's all like how the plot kind of comes not Stan Lee cheesy.

602
00:38:54,875 --> 00:38:56,100
Rym: No, that is a different kind of cheese.

603
00:38:56,461 --> 00:39:00,514
Rym: It's like it's like a fine aged foot cheese as opposed to I like a fine aged foot cheese.

604
00:39:00,534 --> 00:39:01,217
Scott: That's delicious.

605
00:39:01,237 --> 00:39:07,060
Rym: Yeah in gourmet Yeah, so 13th warrior is a movie that you and I can appreciate and enjoy.

606
00:39:07,501 --> 00:39:11,174
Rym: But a movie critic would say yes, this is a badly made movie.

607
00:39:11,335 --> 00:39:12,820
Scott: Well, I mean initial D is bad, too.

608
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:24,760
Rym: Yeah, anyway, anyway, but we're here As a kid, I guess it was partly that Jurassic Park became one of those franchises like the Indiana Jones franchise back to the future.

609
00:39:25,001 --> 00:39:26,248
Scott: It was the biggest deal.

610
00:39:26,288 --> 00:39:28,380
Scott: They were they were 90 merchandise.

611
00:39:28,801 --> 00:39:33,639
Scott: Like you could basically live a Jurassic Park life in terms of like you could buy all Jurassic Park merch.

612
00:39:34,204 --> 00:39:39,700
Scott: You could eat Jurassic Park food See Jurassic Park Jurassic Park cereal.

613
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:40,522
Scott: I bet there was.

614
00:39:40,623 --> 00:39:50,559
Rym: I went to see Jurassic Park at the drive-in like years later in a double feature With I don't remember what the other sure as hell Jurassic Park crunch.

615
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:52,488
Rym: And since you just look it up.

616
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:53,414
Scott: Yeah, it exists.

617
00:39:53,495 --> 00:39:58,620
Rym: Good God See I ate the Nintendo cereal and then I realized to never eat another branded cereal ever again the rest of my life.

618
00:39:58,761 --> 00:39:59,324
Scott: I never ate.

619
00:39:59,585 --> 00:40:02,340
Scott: I didn't eat cereals that much and when I did it was always just Rice Krispies.

620
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,484
Rym: But anyway, I was.

621
00:40:03,524 --> 00:40:08,080
Rym: I was a Frosted Flakes Cinnamon Toast Crunch cuz I just I didn't eat sugar cereals.

622
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:12,040
Scott: I said maybe corn pop but and it was also that honey nut cheerio.

623
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:12,939
Rym: There are movies.

624
00:40:13,361 --> 00:40:19,738
Rym: You know in over the years that set on new bar for special effects in terms of like just how good they were.

625
00:40:19,818 --> 00:40:21,503
Rym: like Star Wars changed the game.

626
00:40:21,844 --> 00:40:22,025
Rym: Mm-hmm.

627
00:40:22,185 --> 00:40:23,569
Rym: The matrix changed the game.

628
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:25,074
Scott: matrix didn't really change the game.

629
00:40:25,094 --> 00:40:27,220
Scott: matrix took someone else's game and brought it to America.

630
00:40:28,682 --> 00:40:37,030
Rym: But at the same time the way some of those scenes were shot and done had never been done with that level of technical ability Maybe like it after that.

631
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:43,171
Rym: I mean every movie did slow toy story change the game Yep, and Jurassic Park in some ways also changed the game.

632
00:40:43,593 --> 00:40:45,800
Scott: Well, yeah kind of mean the dinosaurs look like dinosaurs.

633
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,185
Scott: They didn't look like guy in a zip pursuit.

634
00:40:47,225 --> 00:40:50,979
Rym: Yep, and you know what the effects in Jurassic Park the original movie hold up pretty well.

635
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:53,419
Scott: Yeah, no, because it looks like real dinosaurs.

636
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:54,063
Scott: Yeah, it looks.

637
00:40:54,183 --> 00:40:55,751
Scott: it doesn't look like some CG garbage.

638
00:40:55,932 --> 00:41:10,297
Rym: and I remember when I saw the movie in the theater Like we were there like big screening like opening night when the first big dinosaurs on the screen I remember the entire audience was like Like people really reacted.

639
00:41:10,518 --> 00:41:11,541
Scott: dinosaurs are a big deal.

640
00:41:11,581 --> 00:41:17,740
Rym: that now people don't care about dinosaurs as much because I found out It's just we're older than the people who care like.

641
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,169
Scott: I remember being a second grade and dinosaurs were like that.

642
00:41:20,491 --> 00:41:21,796
Rym: Graders are still like that.

643
00:41:21,836 --> 00:41:24,467
Scott: I think but now dinosaurs have feathers on them.

644
00:41:24,487 --> 00:41:25,030
Scott: They're not as cool.

645
00:41:25,552 --> 00:41:26,396
Rym: I think they're cooler cuz.

646
00:41:26,436 --> 00:41:27,662
Rym: now they're like dragons.

647
00:41:27,983 --> 00:41:42,157
Rym: Yeah Yeah but I I'm pretty sure it's also that remember the only people are really into dinosaurs are kids chase and people with kids People who work at the museum and our friend chase.

648
00:41:42,698 --> 00:41:51,709
Rym: chase is so into Jurassic Park like a friend of ours on his birthday Made him a Jurassic Park themed cake But and had like dinosaur bones on it.

649
00:41:52,091 --> 00:41:55,983
Rym: But what we knew that he didn't know is that as you start excavating the cake to eat it.

650
00:41:56,365 --> 00:41:59,728
Rym: the DVD of Jurassic Park Was inside the cake?

651
00:42:02,175 --> 00:42:14,016
Rym: So, uh, I super into Jurassic Park and I remember as a kid being Really bothered by the tiny differences between the book and the movie and I was one of those people who would go on at length About like.

652
00:42:14,197 --> 00:42:16,650
Rym: well the movie was great except the end was sort of a feel-good.

653
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:21,187
Rym: But really in the book like the Raptors were breeding and like there's something going on.

654
00:42:21,207 --> 00:42:22,130
Scott: I do remember.

655
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:27,004
Scott: I don't remember what the details were but I do remember there were significant differences between the book and the movie.

656
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:32,745
Scott: like remember they go back to like As a kid that have set me greatly and I thought the book was better and there was.

657
00:42:33,006 --> 00:42:41,062
Scott: the only thing I remember clearly detail wise was that there was a scene in the book where they were like trapped behind a waterfall or something and I was Like the most suspenseful.

658
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:45,589
Scott: Oh, yeah Book and that scene was not in the movie at all.

659
00:42:46,433 --> 00:42:51,474
Scott: And I felt like that was like a really critical scene in the book and I was like if anything Why isn't this?

660
00:42:51,555 --> 00:42:56,814
Scott: at least this one scene should have been in the movie and then someone told me I've never seen any movie other Than the first one.

661
00:42:57,236 --> 00:42:59,550
Scott: someone told me that scene is actually in the second movie.

662
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:03,225
Scott: Fuck the second movie, which makes no sense to me, but I've never seen the second movies.

663
00:43:03,266 --> 00:43:04,270
Rym: I'm the second book.

664
00:43:04,711 --> 00:43:07,381
Scott: Yes, second movie is but I don't write hardly room.

665
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:11,416
Scott: I like I barely remember the first book I really don't remember.

666
00:43:11,456 --> 00:43:19,785
Rym: the second second book was actually really bad I really don't remember and it had weird callbacks to the first book now.

667
00:43:19,865 --> 00:43:20,587
Rym: I might be to remember.

668
00:43:20,628 --> 00:43:21,490
Rym: this is from memory.

669
00:43:21,611 --> 00:43:27,874
Rym: I haven't thought about Jurassic Park in like 15 years Jurassic world.

670
00:43:28,396 --> 00:43:29,740
Rym: I thought about it at Chase's birthday.

671
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,667
Scott: How many tries to park movies are there now?

672
00:43:32,028 --> 00:43:32,410
Scott: five?

673
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:34,449
Scott: I've seen one of the first one.

674
00:43:35,011 --> 00:43:36,416
Scott: I've never seen the other one.

675
00:43:36,436 --> 00:43:36,737
Scott: Let's see.

676
00:43:36,958 --> 00:43:39,205
Scott: I heard from other people that six.

677
00:43:39,486 --> 00:43:40,750
Rym: there is a sixth one coming.

678
00:43:40,982 --> 00:43:41,130
Scott: Okay.

679
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:45,870
Scott: So I've heard from other people that in one of these movies a dinosaur like stomps over a city like it's fucking.

680
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:49,081
Rym: Yeah, I think and I'm pretty sure that was Jurassic Park 2 or throughout Dave.

681
00:43:49,121 --> 00:43:50,967
Rym: Let's see bla bla bla bla.

682
00:43:50,988 --> 00:43:51,690
Scott: That's bullshit.

683
00:43:52,394 --> 00:43:53,380
Rym: The Sun Goes Missing.

684
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:54,366
Scott: just watch Godzilla.

685
00:43:54,386 --> 00:44:00,457
Rym: instead Trying to figure out what happens in which of these movies Worked the other way.

686
00:44:00,477 --> 00:44:01,766
Rym: the predator creature survived the second.

687
00:44:01,787 --> 00:44:06,164
Rym: I Can't tell without reading this in more detail.

688
00:44:06,204 --> 00:44:07,570
Scott: So let's talk about the good parts, right?

689
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:14,318
Scott: So first of all that first movie regardless of his differences from the book has one of the greatest soundtracks Has an amazing sound.

690
00:44:14,699 --> 00:44:21,822
Rym: I will find myself humming the Jurassic Park, you know Like to this day that song just pops into my head.

691
00:44:21,982 --> 00:44:23,850
Scott: it's a very high quality movie.

692
00:44:23,971 --> 00:44:26,682
Scott: It's not like some legendary movie, but it's really good.

693
00:44:26,743 --> 00:44:27,667
Rym: It has a really.

694
00:44:27,727 --> 00:44:28,450
Scott: it wasn't in the theater.

695
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:29,781
Scott: It's for a whole year for no reason.

696
00:44:29,801 --> 00:44:30,970
Rym: like good strong characters.

697
00:44:31,131 --> 00:44:33,984
Rym: You know how the matrix set this sort of actually Newman.

698
00:44:34,145 --> 00:44:35,210
Scott: Newman did a great job in that.

699
00:44:36,151 --> 00:44:40,461
Rym: Edgeri nerdy Nedry really Michael Crichton Nedry.

700
00:44:40,862 --> 00:44:44,050
Rym: Yeah, you didn't think we'd see through that the fat shitty guy who dies.

701
00:44:44,452 --> 00:44:45,800
Scott: Yeah, but he deserves to die.

702
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:46,644
Scott: But yeah, I don't like that.

703
00:44:46,685 --> 00:44:47,610
Scott: They made the nerd the villain.

704
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:48,594
Scott: They should have made someone else.

705
00:44:48,654 --> 00:44:52,975
Scott: Yeah, they also made him so shitty and well, but that's the kind of character He plays.

706
00:44:52,995 --> 00:44:53,439
Scott: he played it.

707
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,590
Scott: Well good job acting.

708
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:56,635
Rym: Yeah, no Nedry was like that was you.

709
00:44:57,156 --> 00:45:07,285
Rym: the movie was perfectly cast because that was back when I mean that like So, you know how in the matrix they give you a lot of pseudo philosophy.

710
00:45:07,305 --> 00:45:10,174
Rym: and yes You saw the matrix.

711
00:45:10,215 --> 00:45:11,378
Scott: That's what the matrix is about.

712
00:45:11,478 --> 00:45:19,066
Rym: got really into philosophy, but only this like pop minimal version Jurassic Park was that for the concept of chaos theory.

713
00:45:19,529 --> 00:45:26,967
Rym: every 13-year-old kid was like well chaos theory and then they quote Malcolm in the movie.

714
00:45:26,987 --> 00:45:28,370
Scott: Oh, it's not just teenagers.

715
00:45:28,631 --> 00:45:33,150
Scott: I remember specifically when I was a kid around the same age, right?

716
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:42,722
Scott: I would go to the bookstore and I bought a collection of Dilbert comics in a book and crazy nut job Scott Adams who writes Dilbert who's even crazier nut job now.

717
00:45:42,843 --> 00:45:45,070
Rym: Yeah, he's not only a nut job, but he's a shithead.

718
00:45:45,192 --> 00:45:46,349
Scott: Yeah, he's not a good person.

719
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:56,650
Scott: But anyway, if you read like the old Dilbert books like I was expecting when I bought them I thought that they would be like Calvin and Hobbes book where it's like Oh a collection of all these comics in a book.

720
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:58,339
Rym: How can we afford by someone else?

721
00:45:58,419 --> 00:46:00,530
Scott: right and I didn't read all these in the newspaper.

722
00:46:00,671 --> 00:46:02,200
Scott: How nice is this right to have all these?

723
00:46:02,361 --> 00:46:03,749
Scott: but he doesn't do it like that.

724
00:46:04,132 --> 00:46:06,670
Scott: He would put writing in there, especially in the back.

725
00:46:07,011 --> 00:46:18,510
Scott: He would just write stuff the kind of stuff he writes on the internet now and in the first or second over book I don't know which one it was is a whole nutty thing about chaos theory Which I presumed was because he had read Jurassic Park.

726
00:46:21,131 --> 00:46:27,998
Rym: So this was also the era where I still thought that Jeff Goldblum was a good actor And I remember as a kid looking into that character.

727
00:46:28,038 --> 00:46:31,533
Rym: not a bad actor, but he's I don't know He's not.

728
00:46:31,674 --> 00:46:34,047
Scott: he's not fucking great actor, but I see Jeff Gold.

729
00:46:34,087 --> 00:46:34,650
Rym: He's not bad.

730
00:46:34,931 --> 00:46:37,941
Rym: I just shake my head a little bit and it's hard.

731
00:46:38,021 --> 00:46:40,409
Scott: I think he's a bit typecast for sure.

732
00:46:40,811 --> 00:46:51,516
Scott: Yeah, you know, I mean look in Jurassic Park and in Independence Day, which are pretty much the movies he did back-to-back Right plays basically the same character I was remembering mad as a kid.

733
00:46:51,556 --> 00:46:54,710
Rym: that like I think what is the the old guy Hammond?

734
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:57,802
Rym: I'm pretty sure he dies just like a chump way earlier in the book.

735
00:46:57,943 --> 00:46:58,886
Scott: He survives in the movie.

736
00:46:58,906 --> 00:46:59,449
Scott: I think right.

737
00:46:59,549 --> 00:47:01,156
Rym: Yep Yeah, cuz he's not like.

738
00:47:01,176 --> 00:47:13,182
Rym: they keep giving him morphine in the book and there's this whole thing with the morphine And I remember the one like I think a little dinosaur Great if we're wrong because our memory from the 90s Yeah, but I'm pretty sure he dies cuz like.

739
00:47:13,704 --> 00:47:16,656
Rym: I am also pretty sure no But I'm pretty sure the kids this.

740
00:47:16,817 --> 00:47:19,790
Rym: this is gonna be the test of my memory because I remember the scene for some reason.

741
00:47:20,131 --> 00:47:28,056
Rym: I remember the kids are in a control room somewhere and they find they can hit a button and it like makes Sounds out in the park.

742
00:47:28,076 --> 00:47:29,581
Rym: and what if it makes a t-rex sound?

743
00:47:29,842 --> 00:47:31,970
Rym: and I think it was used to like scare other dinosaurs away?

744
00:47:32,993 --> 00:47:36,149
Rym: So they hit it and it happens and then the book cuts to.

745
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:42,050
Rym: He's fucking walking around in like a morphine stupor and it scares him because he thinks the t-rex is there.

746
00:47:42,090 --> 00:47:56,125
Rym: so he runs away and he runs into a pack a little dinosaurs and the little dinosaurs have a bite that causes you to not feel pain and he gets bitten by one of them and he falls over and then he just goes down like A chump and they eat him and he kind of thinks that he doesn't feel them biting him.

747
00:47:56,406 --> 00:47:57,170
Rym: and how odd that is.

748
00:47:57,933 --> 00:48:00,041
Rym: That's a very specific memory I have.

749
00:48:00,061 --> 00:48:02,210
Scott: I do not have the memory of how he died.

750
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:04,997
Scott: I just remember that.

751
00:48:05,138 --> 00:48:07,885
Scott: my vague memory is the old guy dies in the book.

752
00:48:08,206 --> 00:48:09,870
Scott: Yeah, the old guy was like a bad guy.

753
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:12,830
Scott: He was irresponsible and he's the one who made this stupid park, right?

754
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:16,423
Scott: And he did, you know, so he was a bad person who had played gods.

755
00:48:16,443 --> 00:48:17,266
Scott: Yeah play gods.

756
00:48:17,567 --> 00:48:18,310
Scott: Therefore he died.

757
00:48:18,611 --> 00:48:20,580
Rym: So I also remember a scene in the first one.

758
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:21,283
Rym: remember where they're.

759
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:25,128
Rym: they're using the computer and she's like And then like she saves the day.

760
00:48:25,913 --> 00:48:26,555
Scott: No, I don't remember.

761
00:48:26,575 --> 00:48:28,563
Rym: they like types and commands and like open doors.

762
00:48:28,684 --> 00:48:29,467
Rym: don't remember.

763
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:31,374
Rym: in this I think it's the second book.

764
00:48:32,338 --> 00:48:46,380
Rym: the same fucking scene happens where the two same kids I think find a computer but it's like a more powerful Unix and it's got 3d graphics and there's this rotating cube of menus and they can't figure it out and It's getting more and more complicated.

765
00:48:46,621 --> 00:48:51,870
Rym: and then the girls like wait a minute You couldn't drive that powerful of a graphic system without a fiber optic cable.

766
00:48:52,412 --> 00:48:58,348
Rym: And then she goes behind the computer and finds a fiber optic cable and then they find like a pathway that cable went and they crawl through a hole.

767
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:01,535
Rym: Okay, that's all I remember.

768
00:49:01,556 --> 00:49:02,539
Scott: I don't remember that either.

769
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,703
Rym: I remember those things.

770
00:49:03,883 --> 00:49:05,830
Scott: So let's talk about some other Jurassic Park things, right?

771
00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:07,959
Rym: So the SNES game was kind of legit.

772
00:49:07,999 --> 00:49:08,621
Rym: good, right?

773
00:49:08,662 --> 00:49:14,745
Scott: There was a. there was an SNES Genesis game Which is a platformer and this is one of those cases where SNES one was of FPS.

774
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:16,272
Scott: Oh Really?

775
00:49:16,292 --> 00:49:18,245
Scott: I thought the SNES one was the same as Genesis one.

776
00:49:18,285 --> 00:49:18,769
Rym: No, it was an FPS.

777
00:49:19,292 --> 00:49:22,730
Scott: Oh, well, the Genesis isn't one of those cases where and it was a top-down walk-around.

778
00:49:23,492 --> 00:49:26,170
Scott: This is one of those cases where the Genesis game was way better, right?

779
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:32,110
Scott: The Genesis X-Men game was better the Genesis Aladdin game was better and the Genesis Jurassic Park game was better.

780
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:36,350
Rym: The Genesis X-Men game was the best X-Men game to come out up to that point except for the arcade one.

781
00:49:36,574 --> 00:49:45,200
Scott: Yeah, right But the Genesis Jurassic Park game was like a legit good platformer where you could be the velociraptor or the dude Right and you could do all you could like.

782
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,807
Scott: it was a really good sign.

783
00:49:46,827 --> 00:49:48,213
Scott: a kind of good Platforming.

784
00:49:48,413 --> 00:49:51,203
Scott: action game is really hard and totally worth playing.

785
00:49:51,223 --> 00:49:52,227
Scott: I want to see someone speedrun it.

786
00:49:52,247 --> 00:49:55,535
Scott: Maybe someone has So go back and check that out.

787
00:49:56,238 --> 00:50:01,600
Scott: Also the Jurassic Park for the Sega CD was not good But it was legendary.

788
00:50:01,963 --> 00:50:02,750
Rym: It was definitely.

789
00:50:03,713 --> 00:50:05,950
Scott: It was all about like like you would literally like Walker.

790
00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:07,556
Scott: It was like mist in a way.

791
00:50:07,616 --> 00:50:11,050
Scott: right was like a first person but it was using cutscenes that were pre-rendered.

792
00:50:11,231 --> 00:50:11,532
Scott: So it was.

793
00:50:11,713 --> 00:50:16,997
Scott: it was a lot of loading time from the CD and you couldn't move around and you could certainly look around and Poke and point-and-click.

794
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:24,247
Scott: but then there was some action parts You had to shoot and they basically were trying to steal dinosaurs eggs from around the island without getting murdered.

795
00:50:24,307 --> 00:50:25,410
Scott: and it was weird.

796
00:50:25,531 --> 00:50:26,279
Rym: So Scott, you didn't.

797
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:27,190
Rym: I guess you didn't play it then.

798
00:50:27,270 --> 00:50:32,290
Rym: So the Jurassic Park game on the SNES one it was one of the like ten games that used the mouse.

799
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:33,533
Scott: Whoa, what?

800
00:50:33,734 --> 00:50:35,300
Rym: Yeah, it was an FPS with a mouse.

801
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:37,710
Rym: Okay, or you walked around.

802
00:50:37,770 --> 00:50:45,090
Scott: I think the Sega CD one like like The Sega CD one probably should have had a mouse.

803
00:50:45,171 --> 00:50:46,509
Scott: I don't think there was a mouse for the Sega.

804
00:50:46,731 --> 00:50:54,962
Rym: so you had a top-down like secret of evermore secret amana kind of game where you walk around and like have a little gun and Like shoot like solve puzzles and pick shit up and you know what it was.

805
00:50:55,002 --> 00:50:56,308
Rym: looked a lot like zombies.

806
00:50:56,328 --> 00:50:56,870
Rym: ate my neighbors.

807
00:50:57,915 --> 00:51:11,106
Rym: But then if you went into a building It was an FPS with the mouse and there's Raptors and dark rooms and it was real scary like real scary Like when a rafter came after me like I would flip out and like my brother would scream.

808
00:51:11,166 --> 00:51:12,711
Rym: and those are good times as a Kid.

809
00:51:12,932 --> 00:51:13,856
Rym: Hmm.

810
00:51:13,876 --> 00:51:17,030
Rym: What other games like King Arthur the King Arthur game used the mouse.

811
00:51:18,113 --> 00:51:21,394
Rym: Sim City didn't even though it should have Sim City came.

812
00:51:21,434 --> 00:51:23,203
Scott: it was a launch game for the Super Nintendo.

813
00:51:23,464 --> 00:51:24,710
Scott: the mouse came way way later.

814
00:51:24,770 --> 00:51:27,740
Rym: That's why the mouse came with Mario Paint.

815
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:28,201
Scott: That's right.

816
00:51:28,221 --> 00:51:29,525
Scott: You couldn't even get the mouse on its own.

817
00:51:29,545 --> 00:51:29,626
Scott: Yeah.

818
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:33,970
Rym: Oh my god I was so obsessed with getting that mouse because I was already a PC gamer.

819
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:46,730
Scott: No, we should make a thing where you plug in a normal optical mouse with USB and then it converts it into you know Super Nintendo Mouse and you could plug your regular mouse into a Super Nintendo Except you can just use an emulator and say mouse.

820
00:51:47,172 --> 00:51:51,334
Scott: But I mean if you have a Super Nintendo, but you don't have a mouse those are hard Nintendo.

821
00:51:51,395 --> 00:51:52,158
Rym: I have two of them.

822
00:51:52,198 --> 00:51:52,680
Rym: you want one.

823
00:51:53,062 --> 00:51:54,950
Scott: No, I'm just saying there are people out there.

824
00:51:56,911 --> 00:51:58,860
Rym: I'll bet I can find one for less than 10 bucks.

825
00:51:59,302 --> 00:52:00,910
Scott: You think the mice is less than 10 bucks?

826
00:52:01,191 --> 00:52:02,356
Scott: I think it's rare and expensive.

827
00:52:02,898 --> 00:52:04,164
Rym: I cuz I if it's rare expensive.

828
00:52:04,224 --> 00:52:05,389
Rym: I have two and I'm gonna sell them.

829
00:52:06,374 --> 00:52:06,716
Scott: Good idea.

830
00:52:06,756 --> 00:52:11,013
Rym: All right now a brand new unopened one is $295.

831
00:52:11,013 --> 00:52:13,983
Rym: you don't have that Mario Paint with the mouse 20 bucks.

832
00:52:14,044 --> 00:52:14,566
Rym: buy it now.

833
00:52:14,786 --> 00:52:17,195
Rym: Oh, that's pretty good Mario Paint with the mouse.

834
00:52:17,235 --> 00:52:19,182
Rym: good good quality 30 bucks.

835
00:52:19,363 --> 00:52:19,563
Scott: All right.

836
00:52:19,784 --> 00:52:20,868
Scott: All right, it's not worth that.

837
00:52:20,888 --> 00:52:28,650
Scott: You can get one Yeah, but the problem is that is another thing though You might not want to use that mouse because it's a shitty ball mouse and it'd be much nicer to use a modern optical mouse.

838
00:52:28,931 --> 00:52:33,608
Rym: Oh my god a whole generation of kids don't know what it was like to have a physical mouse with a ball.

839
00:52:33,849 --> 00:52:37,003
Rym: anyway Do a show on mice the evolution of mice over the years?

840
00:52:37,063 --> 00:52:38,170
Scott: Kids these days don't need to have mice.

841
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:39,638
Scott: They got touch screens and touch pads.

842
00:52:39,879 --> 00:52:41,126
Rym: Yeah, and those kids can't play games.

843
00:52:41,187 --> 00:52:48,270
Rym: as a result It's got the tutorial and overwatch is literally like I'm gonna run back and forth across the stream.

844
00:52:48,891 --> 00:52:53,709
Rym: Watch me do it and it makes you like watch like left right.

845
00:52:53,730 --> 00:52:56,680
Scott: Oh Have you ever done the half-life 1 tutorial?

846
00:52:56,821 --> 00:52:57,543
Rym: nope, because I would.

847
00:52:57,644 --> 00:53:01,335
Rym: by the time I played half-life 1 I was already like a pro FPS.

848
00:53:01,395 --> 00:53:04,163
Scott: It's like walk forward jump over this pit.

849
00:53:04,243 --> 00:53:05,065
Rym: Yeah, it's.

850
00:53:05,346 --> 00:53:06,689
Scott: it's basically the same thing.

851
00:53:07,852 --> 00:53:17,050
Rym: so I never saw Jurassic World and it's interesting because Half the people I know who've seen it said that it is an amazing movie and there's a Jurassic Park movie.

852
00:53:17,090 --> 00:53:17,796
Scott: That's not the first one.

853
00:53:17,816 --> 00:53:18,340
Scott: That's amazing.

854
00:53:18,824 --> 00:53:19,630
Scott: That's what I have to be black.

855
00:53:19,731 --> 00:53:22,730
Scott: I was under the impression that they were all garbage knowing almost nothing about them.

856
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:24,610
Rym: Well, the new one apparently is just like really well done.

857
00:53:24,991 --> 00:53:30,650
Rym: But a bunch of people who have seen the movie said that it's hot garbage and it'll just kind of diminish your memory of you.

858
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:31,976
Scott: I mean, he only wrote two books.

859
00:53:32,037 --> 00:53:34,630
Scott: So what did they write for the these future movies?

860
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:38,244
Scott: So I'm pretty sure do all the movies follow from each other?

861
00:53:38,285 --> 00:53:40,656
Scott: if you watch only movies Are they all in the same universe?

862
00:53:40,837 --> 00:53:43,529
Rym: So the second movie I don't think is based on anything.

863
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:47,246
Rym: Okay, cuz it's not the second book as far as I could tell.

864
00:53:47,266 --> 00:53:49,770
Rym: it was just this garbage Follow from the first movie.

865
00:53:50,291 --> 00:53:59,059
Rym: I don't remember because the second the first book already deviates so far from where the first movie ends that They're really couldn't.

866
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:18,154
Rym: if there was any continuity between the two sets I actually don't know because I never kept up on the franchise Jurassic Park as prevalent and Pervasive as it was in pop culture throughout my entire childhood all the way up through high school and I was really into the first movie and the book and the SNES game and Just pop culture like everyone had seen it.

867
00:54:18,214 --> 00:54:19,019
Rym: Everyone knew about it.

868
00:54:19,883 --> 00:54:22,355
Rym: I just stopped paying attention after I saw the second movie and it was bad.

869
00:54:22,395 --> 00:54:23,480
Rym: I just ignored it forever more.

870
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:28,080
Scott: Well, I mean there are these certain franchises that from the 80s and 90s that center on movies, right?

871
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:34,151
Scott: Ghostbusters back to the future Robo cop Terminator 2 Indiana Jones and Star Wars again.

872
00:54:34,171 --> 00:54:36,258
Rym: even that Robo cop the TV show is bad.

873
00:54:36,679 --> 00:54:38,607
Rym: the Animated TV show is bad.

874
00:54:38,908 --> 00:54:39,832
Rym: The second movie is bad.

875
00:54:39,892 --> 00:54:41,680
Rym: The third movie is the worst thing you'll ever see.

876
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:43,493
Scott: I think that's all of them that I've got right.

877
00:54:43,513 --> 00:54:44,239
Scott: Did I cover all of them?

878
00:54:44,501 --> 00:54:46,200
Scott: That's just about all of them, right?

879
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:51,435
Scott: Yeah, the thing is Jurassic Park was actually at its peak other than Star Wars.

880
00:54:51,495 --> 00:54:55,046
Scott: right at its peak time Was the biggest one.

881
00:54:55,086 --> 00:54:59,500
Scott: it was in the movie theater for a year and the most money had the most shit everywhere, right?

882
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,847
Scott: It was way bigger than back to the future wasn't back.

883
00:55:01,908 --> 00:55:03,052
Scott: The future was a new movie.

884
00:55:03,253 --> 00:55:05,260
Rym: There was a big gap between Jurassic.

885
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:06,444
Rym: What was the next thing?

886
00:55:06,665 --> 00:55:10,780
Rym: after like Jurassic Park that became a new franchise like that like a movie franchise?

887
00:55:11,646 --> 00:55:12,190
Scott: I don't even know.

888
00:55:12,633 --> 00:55:16,098
Rym: I think Lord of the Rings Maybe but there's gotta be some matrix.

889
00:55:16,947 --> 00:55:18,140
Scott: Yeah, kinda anyway.

890
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:27,470
Scott: But the point is is that despite being just as big or bigger than most of those at its you know peak time It is faded more.

891
00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:29,240
Scott: It's still around obviously, right?

892
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:29,742
Scott: Cuz something's.

893
00:55:29,762 --> 00:55:34,320
Scott: you know inertia looks like all this but if you look if you were of course, it made a ton of money.

894
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:43,479
Scott: But if you look at say a graph of like where they stand today Like back to the future is way above where you know, Jurassic Park is today, right?

895
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:53,442
Scott: Just like they're how big they are right at this very moment You know, yeah, it's like so Jurassic Park like good because it was the highest and it fell the furthest It doesn't?

896
00:55:53,723 --> 00:55:54,527
Scott: it's not in the gutter.

897
00:55:54,567 --> 00:55:54,909
Scott: They're still.

898
00:55:54,949 --> 00:55:56,376
Scott: you said they're just making another movie, right?

899
00:55:56,456 --> 00:55:57,200
Scott: It's not gone.

900
00:55:57,524 --> 00:55:58,579
Rym: Here's the box office.

901
00:56:00,122 --> 00:56:01,928
Scott: Is it adjusted for inflation now?

902
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:08,493
Rym: Okay, but Jurassic Park won about half a mil 400 grand in North America and a billion worldwide.

903
00:56:08,633 --> 00:56:18,838
Rym: Yeah, uh Lost world the second movie garbage like 200 and some Jurassic Park 3 way less hundred and eighty thousand hundred eighty million.

904
00:56:19,402 --> 00:56:23,418
Scott: and I think that's the reason that Jurassic Park fell farther than those other ones.

905
00:56:23,498 --> 00:56:28,437
Scott: because Even back to the future where the first one was way better than the second and the third right?

906
00:56:28,477 --> 00:56:29,280
Rym: We're still pretty good.

907
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:33,655
Scott: They were still bringing, you know, those second and third aren't remembered as like vile.

908
00:56:33,755 --> 00:56:33,916
Scott: right.

909
00:56:33,976 --> 00:56:35,923
Scott: Star Wars is like boom Boom boom great.

910
00:56:35,943 --> 00:56:36,184
Scott: Great.

911
00:56:36,224 --> 00:56:36,685
Scott: Great, right?

912
00:56:36,725 --> 00:56:40,116
Scott: It's like these other things that happened all matrix here.

913
00:56:40,156 --> 00:56:44,229
Rym: Look, here's the One movie here the run tomatoes ratings Jurassic Park 93%.

914
00:56:44,229 --> 00:56:47,624
Rym: Jurassic Park to 51%.

915
00:56:47,624 --> 00:56:49,340
Rym: Jurassic Park 3 50%.

916
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:51,428
Scott: all right compare that to back to the future.

917
00:56:51,448 --> 00:56:52,411
Scott: I'll.

918
00:56:52,692 --> 00:56:56,084
Scott: even Ghostbusters 2 was better than Jurassic Park.

919
00:56:56,105 --> 00:56:59,015
Rym: - yeah Ghostbusters 2 is actually pretty good movie.

920
00:56:59,075 --> 00:56:59,657
Scott: It's okay.

921
00:56:59,797 --> 00:57:03,079
Scott: Yeah All right, I think nostalgia boosted a lot.

922
00:57:03,983 --> 00:57:07,720
Scott: I think it's also that those characters even Ghostbusters 1 New York boosted a lot.

923
00:57:07,961 --> 00:57:15,391
Rym: The characters are so strong that they kind of carry Ghostbusters - like yeah If that same story wasn't those characters that movie would have been forgotten.

924
00:57:15,411 --> 00:57:18,140
Scott: Terminator Terminator 1. and then Terminator 2 went up.

925
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:20,288
Rym: Yeah, well cuz Terminator 1 was a horror movie.

926
00:57:20,609 --> 00:57:34,411
Rym: Yeah Terminator 2 was like a legit for real awesome sci-fi like science fiction Speculative fiction story I think independently was an amazing amazing action movie of Jurassic Park.

927
00:57:34,431 --> 00:57:46,958
Scott: the point is if Jurassic Park - Had been like Terminator - like even better than Jurassic Park Jurassic Park would have been one of the biggest friends with current Jurassic Park would currently be like the king of all.

928
00:57:47,600 --> 00:58:00,295
Rym: so of these things Jurassic Park 193 - 97 3 2001. so 14 years later in 2015 They made Jurassic World and it made way more money than the original Jurassic Park.

929
00:58:00,415 --> 00:58:03,871
Rym: all the inflation with inflation It's probably about the same amount of money.

930
00:58:04,112 --> 00:58:04,374
Scott: Maybe.

931
00:58:04,454 --> 00:58:07,847
Scott: well movies, you know The size of the movie pie is larger.

932
00:58:08,449 --> 00:58:11,820
Scott: right now the budget actually comparable which is not not the budgets.

933
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:16,395
Scott: I'm talking about the pie of how much money goes into how much money people are spending on movies.

934
00:58:16,555 --> 00:58:26,140
Rym: Rotten Tomatoes rating 72. so the franchise kind of bounced off the bottom of the Jurassic Park 3 and Maybe it's gonna get revitalized Because I feel like Jurassic World.

935
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,770
Scott: they would have to make something like that.

936
00:58:27,870 --> 00:58:33,370
Scott: Just be like such a legendary movie that even people who don't remember or care about Jurassic Park would go see it.

937
00:58:33,450 --> 00:58:34,214
Scott: Yeah, that's how.

938
00:58:34,395 --> 00:58:37,310
Scott: that's how much you would good you would need to do to bring it back.

939
00:58:37,371 --> 00:58:47,063
Rym: The reason it's so tough I think is that one the one of the other huge franchises like Lord of the Rings The Hobbit just like fell through the trapdoor and disappeared into.

940
00:58:47,083 --> 00:58:55,574
Rym: yeah, I didn't even see Hobbit - I didn't Did I see Hobbit - and not you saw - and not three, okay, I saw two and it was so bad I thought about walking out.

941
00:58:55,634 --> 00:58:56,297
Rym: It was awful.

942
00:58:56,418 --> 00:58:57,643
Scott: I didn't see it in a theater.

943
00:58:57,744 --> 00:58:59,190
Scott: I saw - I saw the theater.

944
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:00,676
Scott: I saw one in a theater.

945
00:59:00,736 --> 00:59:02,725
Scott: I saw two elsewhere and I haven't seen three.

946
00:59:03,066 --> 00:59:04,373
Rym: actually kind of an aside You know what?

947
00:59:04,393 --> 00:59:05,462
Scott: I'm just gonna watch Lord of the Rings.

948
00:59:05,805 --> 00:59:10,230
Rym: Mad Max Was such a good movie that I've cuz madman's weird.

949
00:59:10,330 --> 00:59:10,431
Rym: Like.

950
00:59:10,471 --> 00:59:14,550
Rym: a lot of people know what Mad Max is but hadn't actually ever seen a Mad Max movie.

951
00:59:14,630 --> 00:59:18,070
Scott: That's actually an example of you know, even though I still haven't seen it, right?

952
00:59:19,434 --> 00:59:23,849
Scott: It shows that it is possible to revive some old dead franchise.

953
00:59:24,009 --> 00:59:35,296
Rym: Scott I'm like, like I know you you have to see it at some point because I'm not even exaggerating Mad Max was the best movie of that year hands down but Jurassic World was about.

954
00:59:35,457 --> 00:59:40,030
Rym: probably it looks like it's a being treated about as good as the new Star Wars.

955
00:59:40,614 --> 00:59:42,790
Rym: Both of them are like this level of movie.

956
00:59:43,192 --> 00:59:46,170
Rym: The problem is they have to compete in a world where the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

957
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:47,174
Scott: I think that's basically like.

958
00:59:47,194 --> 00:59:53,599
Scott: there's like this level now of like how big your movie can be and that's how big your movie can Be these days unless you're the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

959
00:59:53,639 --> 00:59:54,703
Scott: I think that's the level though.

960
00:59:54,723 --> 00:59:55,245
Rym: It's yeah.

961
00:59:55,265 --> 00:59:56,710
Rym: Well, yeah, that's the top, right?

962
00:59:57,310 --> 01:00:01,256
Rym: But look at that That's a new kind of franchise.

963
01:00:01,377 --> 01:00:13,623
Rym: every one of these things we talked about from the 90s and the 2000s was Make a movie part two part three part four Marvel Cinematic Universe was movie movie movie movie movie.

964
01:00:13,844 --> 01:00:16,976
Rym: Let's mash them all together into another movie Movie movie movie.

965
01:00:17,017 --> 01:00:19,470
Rym: mash those into a movie mash them all into a movie.

966
01:00:20,333 --> 01:00:24,850
Rym: Like all these parallel threads like this totally different way of going about making a movie franchise.

967
01:00:26,312 --> 01:00:28,063
Rym: That's all I got on Star Wars Jurassic Park.

968
01:00:28,104 --> 01:00:28,869
Scott: I don't remember anymore.

969
01:00:34,114 --> 01:00:36,650

986
01:02:03,172 --> 01:02:05,459
Rym: Yes, we know the forum is down.

987
01:02:05,579 --> 01:02:09,150
Rym: There is an outage at rack space and that is affecting us.

988
01:02:09,532 --> 01:02:14,084
Rym: And as much as I love you guys, we're not paying enough money to have multi data center.

989
01:02:14,205 --> 01:02:17,259
Rym: aware Fully ha dr forums.

990
01:02:17,701 --> 01:02:20,270
Rym: I could put the patreon money toward that and a better forum.

991
01:02:20,913 --> 01:02:29,330
Rym: You probably expect me to put the major and money towards something much larger like a Convention or a bunch of video equipment because we're gonna accelerate some of our video content.

992
01:02:29,872 --> 01:02:35,410
Rym: But I tried to use the money to give to let Scott pay for a bunch of wireless equipment that he bought.

993
01:02:35,894 --> 01:02:37,810
Rym: But he doesn't want the patreon money.

994
01:02:37,890 --> 01:02:39,175
Rym: So he bought that on his own.

995
01:02:39,536 --> 01:02:43,290
Rym: but nonetheless, we'll get to use that stuff to make a bunch of video.

996
01:02:43,811 --> 01:02:50,190
Rym: So the patreon money is still safe and sound and ready for some gigantic project that we will start using in the near future.

997
01:02:50,591 --> 01:02:52,175
Rym: I actually haven't even claimed it all yet.

998
01:02:52,716 --> 01:02:54,581
Rym: But anyway without further ado.

999
01:02:54,601 --> 01:03:34,451
Rym: I leave you with some Simpson wave Oh.
