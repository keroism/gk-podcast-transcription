Scott: Let's do this Mmm.

5
00:00:23,536 --> 00:00:31,649
Scott: It's that time of the year You don't want to go to work when people obviously that's that's every time of the yeah When you don't have any fucking money.

6
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:37,030
Rym: Yeah, yeah, it's like the tail end of a lot of the expenses that came up.

7
00:00:37,392 --> 00:00:47,469
Scott: It's like oh just bought me a plane ticket to PAX Yeah and bought some Tickets to PAX that I have to then turn back in and we didn't even pay for the hotel at PAX.

8
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,750
Rym: yet We're gonna pay for that when we get there right looming expense.

9
00:00:51,172 --> 00:00:53,686
Scott: And then you know, it's like there's a lot of stuff that gets paid for.

10
00:00:53,706 --> 00:00:58,506
Rym: like right after PAX I'm going to Australia with Emily too and I like my church paid for but hers isn't.

11
00:00:59,068 --> 00:01:02,770
Scott: and then You know even people who aren't in like, you know a pack situation.

12
00:01:02,871 --> 00:01:06,649
Scott: It's like they got a. you know, some people got to spend money on back-to-school shit.

13
00:01:07,255 --> 00:01:08,930
Scott: You know, it's like some people, you know, so much.

14
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:13,710
Scott: It's for some reason no matter which kind of if you live in a you know, this society.

15
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:20,990
Scott: I guess this happens to be a time of year when the money gets spent and then you got to save the money again.

16
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,657
Scott: See how you have holiday monies.

17
00:01:22,677 --> 00:01:24,745
Rym: I mean, I we don't worry about money like.

18
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:26,030
Rym: we're pretty well off money wise.

19
00:01:26,111 --> 00:01:28,369
Rym: It's just kind of how it goes, you know tech guys in New York.

20
00:01:28,691 --> 00:01:38,525
Rym: But this is the time of year when I go from ignoring my finances to paying my credit card and saying wait Really that much and then click it on transactions like what the fuck did I buy?

21
00:01:38,545 --> 00:01:41,189
Rym: and then it's like oh, yeah I guess a bunch of plane tickets.

22
00:01:41,951 --> 00:01:53,992
Scott: So, of course, this is also the time of the year when some guy finally decides to call me like two years After I fill out a web form and say hey you want to give me like a whole bunch of money and I'm like god Damn you.

23
00:01:54,032 --> 00:01:54,876
Scott: Why are you calling now?

24
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:59,778
Rym: Oh, oh, I know what guy you're talking about Right the guy from the ticket office.

25
00:01:59,798 --> 00:02:02,890
Rym: So they have not called me yet for whatever reason, right?

26
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:12,889
Scott: So, you know by there are certain things in life that are usually the realm, you know Usually priced in the realm where only rich people can have them like a Ferrari.

27
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:15,157
Rym: Yep Now a lot of these things are also things.

28
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:16,883
Rym: there are things that are rich.

29
00:02:16,923 --> 00:02:23,910
Rym: people today are the only people who have them But in a distant past these are the kinds of things that a family would save up for in like half.

30
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,498
Scott: Yeah, you could have a Ferrari a long time ago.

31
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:28,083
Scott: Maybe if you were half rich.

32
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:38,599
Scott: Yeah now you got to be whole rich Right, but one of those things that you used to be able to afford even if you were not rich With season tickets to sporting events.

33
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,410
Rym: now, you can still afford them if you live somewhere terrible.

34
00:02:41,691 --> 00:02:46,470
Scott: Well, okay, if you maybe if you live somewhere terrible, but also how much are season tickets to the Sabres?

35
00:02:47,493 --> 00:02:47,896
Scott: I don't know.

36
00:02:48,118 --> 00:02:49,510
Rym: I'm gonna try to look it up while you keep talking.

37
00:02:49,610 --> 00:03:01,230
Scott: Like even if you want to buy Mets season tickets, right and you can sit in the nosebleed at the top of the stadium It's still a shit ton of games like 90 games multiplied by ticket price, right?

38
00:03:01,511 --> 00:03:07,769
Scott: It's thousands of dollars to buy those tickets and then even if you do and even if you're a super Mets fan You don't have time for that shit, right?

39
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,360
Scott: But a long time ago years ago.

40
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,501
Scott: I filled out a form that said Yeah, I'll buy some season tickets to New York Rangers.

41
00:03:15,581 --> 00:03:19,095
Scott: Why the fuck not if you call me and I can't afford them I just won't buy them.

42
00:03:19,436 --> 00:03:21,406
Rym: I got on the list but I actually so way back.

43
00:03:21,506 --> 00:03:22,250
Rym: I did the same thing.

44
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:23,615
Rym: But I put myself in the like.

45
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:28,634
Rym: I want a full season of really good seats because I figure by the time I get to The top of that waiting list.

46
00:03:29,156 --> 00:03:31,285
Rym: I'm hoping that I'll be like 50 and rich.

47
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:32,249
Scott: Good luck with that.

48
00:03:32,852 --> 00:03:36,130
Rym: So Scott, how much you think it costs to get a season ticket?

49
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:41,343
Rym: Full-on season a hundred percent season to a decent seat at the Buffalo Sabres.

50
00:03:41,363 --> 00:03:43,490
Scott: I imagine it's like 50 games ish, right?

51
00:03:44,131 --> 00:03:52,262
Scott: Yeah, all right every game like rings probably 50 games Times like let's say let's say ringside.

52
00:03:52,503 --> 00:03:55,554
Scott: Oh, that's got to be at least like $200.

53
00:03:55,554 --> 00:03:57,902
Rym: so no, there's it's 70 bucks a game.

54
00:03:58,243 --> 00:04:06,590
Rym: It's three grand percent for center ice Most expensive the 200 Club like now, let's see.

55
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:09,059
Scott: Well, let me like at ringside.

56
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:10,745
Scott: so I'm thinking at the glass center.

57
00:04:10,845 --> 00:04:15,420
Rym: Yes at the glass Not center ice but like one right of center ice.

58
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:20,517
Scott: Mm-hmm Yeah, that's the whole season it's only.

59
00:04:20,558 --> 00:04:24,090
Rym: it's only 100 bucks to go to one of those games just buying a ticket, right?

60
00:04:24,351 --> 00:04:25,584
Scott: So I bought Rangers tickets.

61
00:04:25,725 --> 00:04:29,859
Scott: finally Oh my god They were able say I couldn't afford a whole season.

62
00:04:30,401 --> 00:04:34,742
Scott: and even if I could have afforded a half season Which I assume would be three times.

63
00:04:34,782 --> 00:04:35,970
Scott: I couldn't have afforded a half season.

64
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:44,346
Scott: Yeah, even if I that would have been like credit debt for a little while even if I could have afforded a Half season I couldn't have gone to all those games.

65
00:04:44,366 --> 00:04:48,747
Rym: Yep, right And while we could easily scalp them to make up the cost that is a pain in the ass.

66
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,430
Scott: it's pain in the ass.

67
00:04:51,271 --> 00:04:56,690
Scott: So they have the like the small the mini plan, which is 11 games and you know, they rip you off.

68
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,570
Scott: They make you buy the preseason game which cost the same as a regular game.

69
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:03,943
Rym: So really a cheap seat costs at a Sabres preseason game a cheap seat.

70
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,387
Scott: Yeah, 15 bucks up 14.

71
00:05:05,387 --> 00:05:14,610
Rym: All right Yeah, 15 gets you down a whole rung anyway so The you can't really choose.

72
00:05:15,012 --> 00:05:16,558
Scott: This is the first basically the way it works.

73
00:05:16,618 --> 00:05:20,868
Scott: the more years you do it the sooner you get to buy the tickets We need more seats are available.

74
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:26,266
Scott: So since I'm in year one, I was actually shocked that any seats are available because they bit first.

75
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:39,625
Scott: you make a deposit $500 deposit and if you don't get tickets, you can either leave your deposit in to basically hold your space in line Or take your money back without losing anything.

76
00:05:39,786 --> 00:05:40,913
Rym: a moral here Alrighties.

77
00:05:40,933 --> 00:05:43,064
Rym: you kids complain about comic-con or PAX tickets.

78
00:05:43,285 --> 00:05:44,992
Rym: It could be way worse Right.

79
00:05:45,052 --> 00:05:45,574
Scott: So I left.

80
00:05:45,654 --> 00:05:48,302
Scott: I put the final deposit in like months ago.

81
00:05:48,322 --> 00:05:52,835
Scott: So they were holding on to my $500 for months Right, then they.

82
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:58,789
Scott: he calls me like a week ago and he's like, alright on Friday I'm gonna I'm gonna call you again and that's when you can actually buy tickets.

83
00:05:59,313 --> 00:05:59,978
Scott: Here are the four.

84
00:05:59,998 --> 00:06:01,569
Scott: here are the plans you can choose from.

85
00:06:02,192 --> 00:06:07,410
Scott: So one of the mini I. there are four mini plans and one of them had better opponents and better times to go see the games.

86
00:06:07,876 --> 00:06:13,021
Scott: So I chose that one And he's like you probably only buy tickets like behind the net.

87
00:06:13,141 --> 00:06:16,310
Scott: I'm like, alright, whatever and next year maybe better tickets.

88
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:23,710
Scott: So he calls me on Friday last week and the tickets were a hundred and eighty dollars each times eleven.

89
00:06:26,672 --> 00:06:29,649
Scott: So like four thousand dollars for two seats times two seats.

90
00:06:31,711 --> 00:06:37,770
Scott: So a bottom and I can probably make the money back no matter at least half the money back because I almost all of them.

91
00:06:38,192 --> 00:06:44,917
Scott: If you decide you don't want them, I mean, I'm either gonna go to a game which for $180 And actually the seats are in the corner.

92
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:46,583
Scott: They're not like straight behind the net.

93
00:06:46,603 --> 00:06:48,490
Scott: They're actually really good seats.

94
00:06:48,871 --> 00:06:51,740
Rym: I prefer sitting in the corner.

95
00:06:51,761 --> 00:06:54,269
Scott: They're on the 100 level, but they're kind of high up on the 100 level.

96
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:55,775
Scott: So it's not like you're so low.

97
00:06:55,795 --> 00:07:03,346
Rym: You can't see what's going on the other side, but like I for real I'd rather say That's all high up nose bleeds than perfect center ice most of the time.

98
00:07:03,807 --> 00:07:11,521
Scott: Anyway, so and then I just paid the money, but the $500 deposit went towards it.

99
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:13,426
Scott: So it actually cost me only 3500 additional dollars.

100
00:07:15,132 --> 00:07:17,550
Rym: All right, so I did any and I bought two tickets.

101
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,730
Scott: So if I go to a game I still selling the other ticket to somebody.

102
00:07:21,032 --> 00:07:29,770
Scott: Yeah, either someone I know or someone I don't know I'm gonna charge him what it cost or I'm gonna charge, you know more than what it cost to make my money back.

103
00:07:29,971 --> 00:07:35,600
Scott: yeah, and if they make the playoffs which yeah, I Can sell one.

104
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:35,984
Scott: you can.

105
00:07:36,105 --> 00:07:41,362
Scott: you know I'm in line To get playoff tickets more easily and I can sell those.

106
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:50,150
Scott: that even if I buy five games of playoff tickets I'm buying four games at face value and selling one game at like way above face value and I can just pay for everything.

107
00:07:50,793 --> 00:07:54,010
Scott: It's like the whole thing will break even if I just sell one game of playoff tickets.

108
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,717
Scott: Cuz one seat for the playoffs.

109
00:07:55,737 --> 00:07:56,660
Scott: like a thousand dollars.

110
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,210
Scott: now you've got but I'm only paying like a hundred something for it.

111
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:03,650
Rym: You've got extra incentive for them to make the playoffs than normal, right?

112
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:08,070
Scott: And then next year I could just if I save my money I can do it again and get a better seat.

113
00:08:08,412 --> 00:08:10,629
Scott: Yeah, you know, but yeah, we'll see how this goes.

114
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:14,607
Scott: So my parents bought season tickets in the nosebleeds in the 70s.

115
00:08:15,571 --> 00:08:19,689
Scott: But if you look at those tickets, which they physically have it's like five bucks.

116
00:08:20,971 --> 00:08:25,345
Scott: Five bucks per game times every single game for the Buffalo Sabres.

117
00:08:25,747 --> 00:08:30,690
Scott: if you wanted to sit Run why do you want a chicken Buffalo Sabres on to check like, Arizona?

118
00:08:31,831 --> 00:08:33,255
Rym: Because I feel like Sabres might.

119
00:08:33,636 --> 00:08:36,626
Rym: it's just Sabres is a nice baseline for crappy tickets.

120
00:08:36,785 --> 00:08:37,929
Scott: Why'd you take Florida Panthers?

121
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:48,997
Rym: $4,400 is season tickets ringside center ice every game And all the preseason.

122
00:08:49,017 --> 00:08:51,110
Scott: so we moved to Buffalo for the same amount of money.

123
00:08:51,391 --> 00:08:55,788
Scott: I could have seen every game and not just 11, but would you want to know?

124
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:59,348
Scott: Yeah Well, no if I'm in Buffalo, yes, cuz there's nothing else to do.

125
00:09:01,171 --> 00:09:03,458
Rym: Drive to RIT and see for RIT games instead.

126
00:09:03,478 --> 00:09:05,485
Scott: Yeah, but I mean you got time for both.

127
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:07,030
Scott: Yeah, what else are you doing?

128
00:09:08,391 --> 00:09:10,557
Rym: So you got any news cuz it's anime day.

129
00:09:10,577 --> 00:09:12,162
Scott: I got so much news right here.

130
00:09:12,202 --> 00:09:13,607
Scott: So first little news is yep.

131
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:25,329
Scott: little news number one Naoki Urosawa's current manga Billy Bat which has been coming out slowly and sporadically but not in English at all Which I have not read any of not even like bootleg scans lation Whatever is coming out.

132
00:09:25,613 --> 00:09:37,146
Scott: It will end in three chapters Which means if you follow the pattern of history all of his mangas have come out except for the ones that were way old Have started coming out in English after they finished in Japanese, right?

133
00:09:37,186 --> 00:09:38,150
Scott: It's like 20th century boys.

134
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,253
Scott: The last volume came out.

135
00:09:39,815 --> 00:09:41,379
Scott: then they announced it for English.

136
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,970
Scott: So they the Billy Bat is gonna end in three chapters.

137
00:09:45,431 --> 00:09:49,738
Scott: So I assume that Viz will probably announce volume one like next year sometime.

138
00:09:49,758 --> 00:09:51,220
Scott: Yeah, which is gonna be great.

139
00:09:52,841 --> 00:10:00,650
Scott: Small news number two this week on the comic book delivery list is I think Queen emerald is volume one.

140
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:03,079
Scott: It's been waiting for for like ever.

141
00:10:04,943 --> 00:10:12,060
Scott: It's actually a hardcover which is weird, but yet no Legi Matsumoto manga has not had great releases in the US.

142
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:18,860
Scott: I think there were a few volumes of Galaxy Express released a long time ago, and I don't know if any Harlock mangas came out.

143
00:10:18,921 --> 00:10:23,530
Scott: I think there were some Adaptations that weren't actually the originals released.

144
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:26,300
Rym: don't see him even in like bargain bins hanging around at anime.

145
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,900
Scott: Yeah, there I don't think they were ever put out in English officially, but there's a ton of them and I'd like to read them.

146
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,533
Scott: So hooray volume one.

147
00:10:32,553 --> 00:10:38,273
Scott: Yeah This was true in the past but it went away but now it's back.

148
00:10:38,574 --> 00:10:45,577
Scott: you can watch the three Original Mobile Suit Gundam compilation movies on YouTube for a limited time with subtitles for free.

149
00:10:46,319 --> 00:10:49,380
Scott: legally They keep putting them up and taking them away.

150
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:54,760
Scott: There's like a YouTube channel Gundam info Like put stuff up and takes it down and put stuff up and takes it down even other people.

151
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,069
Rym: What's funny is the same thing just happened to through Tana all of you.

152
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:59,237
Rym: Tana is just on YouTube right now legit.

153
00:10:59,538 --> 00:11:02,203
Scott: Nice Subbed.

154
00:11:02,283 --> 00:11:05,595
Scott: I assume I didn't check because it was on Hulu dubbed for a long time.

155
00:11:05,615 --> 00:11:06,036
Scott: Anyway, yeah.

156
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:13,000
Scott: So yeah, I mean I just watched the TV show but people say you should watch the compilation movies.

157
00:11:13,525 --> 00:11:17,711
Rym: It's faster to do that Watch the original Gundam.

158
00:11:17,752 --> 00:11:19,060
Rym: So maybe I should just watch all these movies.

159
00:11:19,161 --> 00:11:22,739
Scott: It's the same story, but the compilation movies cut out some stuff.

160
00:11:23,201 --> 00:11:27,738
Scott: But really if you just read the Gundam the origin manga, you don't need any of these animes.

161
00:11:27,778 --> 00:11:33,626
Rym: Yep I read a little bit of that and I got to just queue up time to read the whole thing because it It's real good.

162
00:11:33,646 --> 00:11:34,229
Rym: Okay.

163
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:38,984
Scott: Now the real news at Comic Con Announced Fox.

164
00:11:39,004 --> 00:11:45,284
Scott: All right, whatever has acquired the rights and is developing a film for Mouse guard.

165
00:11:45,424 --> 00:11:50,157
Rym: don't get too excited because as you know movies can be finished and not actually come out.

166
00:11:50,638 --> 00:11:51,300
Scott: that is true.

167
00:11:51,441 --> 00:11:58,351
Scott: But this doesn't seem like it's one of those cases where they are Like got the rights and did not making anything.

168
00:11:58,712 --> 00:12:00,760
Scott: It seems like they're actually making right?

169
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:09,534
Scott: So the guy riding it is Gary Witte who wrote the Star Wars Rogue One movie that we haven't seen yet Yep, and they got some big animator resources.

170
00:12:09,594 --> 00:12:22,597
Scott: He's been like a mouseguard fan for a while And also they're using like this motion capture CG technology to do it Which is the same stuff they used for like one of the recent Planet of the Apes movies

171
00:12:22,778 --> 00:12:26,473
Rym: jungle book Which I heard mixed feelings on but at least is beautiful.

172
00:12:26,795 --> 00:12:32,118
Scott: Yeah, so that's the technology They're gonna use to animate this which I guess is a lot easier than you know.

173
00:12:32,158 --> 00:12:35,164
Scott: hand drawing In the style of.

174
00:12:35,405 --> 00:12:48,621
Scott: could you imagine trying to animate it like by hand or even by computer and have it look like the David Peterson artwork it's like out in 2013?

175
00:12:48,621 --> 00:12:50,748
Scott: Yeah, something like that it would take for fucking ever.

176
00:12:50,788 --> 00:12:54,360
Scott: so I guess that's a good choice and David Peterson doesn't seem upset.

177
00:12:54,581 --> 00:12:57,611
Scott: He's probably happy that is being made and also happy.

178
00:12:57,691 --> 00:12:58,293
Scott: He's good money.

179
00:12:58,313 --> 00:13:00,160
Rym: Yeah, I imagine he's happy about this.

180
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,528
Rym: Mouseguard is pretty cool.

181
00:13:02,568 --> 00:13:05,080
Scott: He seems thumbs up on this like yeah, like oh, yeah.

182
00:13:05,461 --> 00:13:09,740
Scott: So if the guy who made the originals thumbs up, why wouldn't we be thumbs?

183
00:13:09,921 --> 00:13:11,004
Rym: He's also a pretty cool dude.

184
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:17,103
Scott: if you watched any and thankfully because it's something that's all mice then You can't.

185
00:13:17,123 --> 00:13:21,773
Scott: we don't have to worry about a lot of issues like whitewashing or actor selection.

186
00:13:21,974 --> 00:13:23,237
Rym: What about man?

187
00:13:23,317 --> 00:13:24,380
Rym: if it's just mice?

188
00:13:26,082 --> 00:13:26,788
Rym: Why mice and men?

189
00:13:27,433 --> 00:13:28,300
Rym: why are we leaving the men out?

190
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,305
Rym: Man erasure.

191
00:13:30,586 --> 00:13:30,928
Scott: Yeah.

192
00:13:31,009 --> 00:13:32,316
Scott: Yeah, which way did you go?

193
00:13:32,598 --> 00:13:36,020
Rym: Yeah So Something happening.

194
00:13:36,281 --> 00:13:42,780
Scott: Well, I think this is now like the one of the only makes the shortlist of movies to be hyped for in the future.

195
00:13:42,941 --> 00:13:43,849
Rym: I am moderately high.

196
00:13:43,869 --> 00:13:47,495
Rym: Uh What if I was what was I hyped for before this?

197
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,545
Scott: I guess Zootopia I'm also hyped for.

198
00:13:49,586 --> 00:13:50,530
Scott: I'm hyped for Rogue One.

199
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:52,820
Scott: So Gary what is gone to out of the short list?

200
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:58,059
Rym: I am super high for Rogue One because while Star Wars episode, you know, the newest one was not the best movie ever.

201
00:13:58,744 --> 00:14:00,416
Rym: Pretty good, like it reminded.

202
00:14:00,658 --> 00:14:01,662
Scott: I mean I'm just.

203
00:14:01,823 --> 00:14:05,996
Scott: I don't even care if Rogue One is garbage because I'm all about spaceships gonna pee pee.

204
00:14:06,017 --> 00:14:07,040
Rym: Pee also now.

205
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:17,563
Scott: So you tell me we're making a new Star Wars movie and not only are we gonna have Starships going pee-pee-pew like every other Star Wars movie we focusing in on that shit and I'm like, well, I don't care This is garbage.

206
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,693
Scott: Yeah, you got X-wing.

207
00:14:19,713 --> 00:14:20,658
Scott: Yeah, you got a tie fighter.

208
00:14:20,678 --> 00:14:20,939
Scott: All right.

209
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,988
Scott: Well, also our time money shut up and take my money.

210
00:14:24,189 --> 00:14:28,240
Rym: Vice Admiral Thrawn up is now canonical in the new Star Wars universe.

211
00:14:28,281 --> 00:14:31,460
Scott: Yeah I don't think he'd be at any live action in the theater.

212
00:14:31,641 --> 00:14:37,259
Rym: It would make a lot of sense for him to be in one of the regular trilogy movies that are coming out.

213
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:41,155
Rym: I would hope they would because there is a way to have him.

214
00:14:41,496 --> 00:14:45,658
Rym: like, you know The Empire sent people out to the Outer Rym and he was leading them.

215
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:47,467
Rym: He shows up and goes.

216
00:14:47,607 --> 00:14:50,460
Rym: what the fuck happened here because one in charge.

217
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:53,676
Scott: Well, I read those throng novels that are so hyped by people.

218
00:14:53,697 --> 00:14:55,527
Scott: They're not good They're way overrated.

219
00:14:55,608 --> 00:15:05,700
Scott: and if you tell me those are the best Star Wars novels I'm not reading any others garbage, but that doesn't mean the character of Admiral Thrawn is not the ultimate badass best Star Wars character.

220
00:15:05,841 --> 00:15:06,771
Scott: there is period.

221
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:18,460
Rym: I Learned you he was when I played TIE fighter and Darth Vader's like sitting signal Vice Admiral Thrawn I have the tie squadron attack or whatever and then it cuts to this dude and he's sitting there holding stroking his chin.

222
00:15:18,582 --> 00:15:19,899
Scott: He clearly knows what he's doing.

223
00:15:20,207 --> 00:15:22,386
Scott: Yeah Like he looks like a badass.

224
00:15:22,627 --> 00:15:26,640
Rym: him and Darth and the moth the grandma for the only people who seem to know what they were.

225
00:15:27,463 --> 00:15:29,329
Scott: You know, the thing is Vice Admiral Thrawn.

226
00:15:29,489 --> 00:15:35,910
Scott: He looks a lot like one of my favorite x-men villains, mr Sinister, so I think I just like evil dudes with square heads.

227
00:15:36,331 --> 00:15:40,084
Rym: Yeah, maybe bluish tint to the skin - mr Sinister is kind of white.

228
00:15:40,486 --> 00:15:43,559
Rym: Yeah depends on who and when who drew him and when.

229
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:47,164
Scott: Yes Mr.

230
00:15:47,204 --> 00:15:48,690
Scott: Sinister who is not like a white?

231
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:53,071
Rym: I've seen him white with like like, you know the shading on a face I've seen like blue shade.

232
00:15:53,132 --> 00:15:54,280
Rym: blue is shading on the face.

233
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,757
Scott: He's got a red diamond thing stuck in his head.

234
00:15:56,777 --> 00:16:01,880
Scott: Yeah And he's got a wicked cool cape that's like made of strips of like.

235
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,211
Scott: It looks like his cape went through a shredder and he put it back on.

236
00:16:04,352 --> 00:16:05,859
Scott: Yeah, you didn't give a shit.

237
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:15,648
Rym: So at the comic-con another thing that we saw briefly and we don't really have any thoughts on other than we'll probably the only time We have Wednesday news and there's a comic-con and we blow it all in one episode.

238
00:16:15,688 --> 00:16:19,700
Rym: Yep, but just guy Rishi's making a King Arthur movie.

239
00:16:20,182 --> 00:16:26,194
Scott: Oh, yeah, that's making the shortlist for hype - cuz hey, I don't care if that's garbage either It's Guy Ritchie and a King Arthur movie.

240
00:16:26,215 --> 00:16:31,640
Rym: cuz you might be thinking wait Is he just gonna make a King Arthur movie but with the beats and tropes of a heist movie?

241
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,788
Rym: And yes, there's apparently.

242
00:16:32,828 --> 00:16:34,220
Rym: yes, that is exactly what he's now.

243
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,340
Scott: The only disappointment I have in the trailer is that he pulls the sword from the stone.

244
00:16:38,903 --> 00:16:45,125
Scott: But if you know Lady of the Lake you wanted right under water Standing of King Arthur ness, right?

245
00:16:45,165 --> 00:16:51,040
Scott: Yeah young King Arthur pulls the sword from the stone and then somehow it gets lost or some shit.

246
00:16:51,282 --> 00:16:52,453
Scott: No, no, that's not what it was.

247
00:16:52,493 --> 00:16:52,856
Scott: I remember.

248
00:16:52,897 --> 00:16:56,120
Scott: now He pulls Excalibur from the stone when he's a young.

249
00:16:56,762 --> 00:17:03,866
Scott: The sword that the Lady of Lake gives him is not Excalibur or the sword in the stone isn't Excalibur and the Lady of Lake Sword is Excalibur.

250
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:05,193
Scott: I think that's what it is.

251
00:17:05,213 --> 00:17:07,242
Rym: I Don't actually remember.

252
00:17:07,262 --> 00:17:07,604
Rym: I used to.

253
00:17:07,704 --> 00:17:08,769
Scott: I'm pretty sure that's what it is.

254
00:17:08,809 --> 00:17:11,619
Scott: The sword in the stone is not Excalibur, right?

255
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,460
Scott: He pulls the sword from the stone and that's how they know he's gonna be king.

256
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,200
Scott: But Excalibur is a magic sword that doesn't make you king or anything.

257
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,105
Scott: It's just awesome.

258
00:17:19,547 --> 00:17:21,296
Scott: And that's what you get from the Lady of the Lake.

259
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:29,874
Scott: So Sword in the stone is supposed to belong to young King Arthur so that they know he's gonna be king and that's why Merlin starts You know hyping him up when he's young.

260
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,719
Rym: Excalibur and the sword in the stone.

261
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:34,783
Rym: Arthurian romance.

262
00:17:35,144 --> 00:17:37,090
Rym: Arthur obtained the British throne by pulling a sword from a stone.

263
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,233
Rym: Father Sigmund and account cannot be from trying to figure it out.

264
00:17:41,253 --> 00:17:42,940
Scott: The sword in the stone is not Excalibur.

265
00:17:43,252 --> 00:17:53,120
Rym: Yep and I want if you go to the Wikipedia on Excalibur the first big set segment is called titled Excalibur and the sword in the And it's not the same sword.

266
00:17:53,361 --> 00:18:00,340
Rym: However in what was called the post Vulgate cycle Excalibur was given to Arthur by the Lady in the Lake sometime after he began his reign.

267
00:18:00,681 --> 00:18:07,064
Rym: she calls the sword Excalibur as to say that that is to say as cut steel in Vulgate Mortar to.

268
00:18:07,205 --> 00:18:10,215
Rym: Arthur orders Grifflet to throw the sword into an enchanted lake.

269
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:17,705
Rym: after two failed attempts He finally complies with the wounded Kings request and a hand emerges from late to catch it Etc.

270
00:18:17,726 --> 00:18:19,798
Rym: I never really knew Arthurian legend that.

271
00:18:19,838 --> 00:18:23,675
Scott: well I'm saying is that Lady Lake is better than the stone.

272
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:24,680
Scott: That's all I'm saying.

273
00:18:24,981 --> 00:18:28,336
Rym: So another great thing happened at comic-con it looks like but I'm saving that for my thing of the day.

274
00:18:28,356 --> 00:18:29,973
Rym: and something kind of shitty happened as well.

275
00:18:31,003 --> 00:18:34,477
Scott: This was my money by that in the Holy Grail say watery tarts.

276
00:18:42,081 --> 00:18:46,775
Rym: So there was a women in film production panel at SCCC, that's fine, that's a good panel.

277
00:18:47,136 --> 00:18:48,420
Rym: looks like it was a really good panel.

278
00:18:49,700 --> 00:19:01,492
Rym: Apparently a SDCC staffer was in charge of the room to be like the moderator or whatever But the women on the panel were moderating it themselves and everything was fine.

279
00:19:02,033 --> 00:19:10,038
Rym: and apparently near the end of the panel This dude who is officially in charge basically just takes over the panel and

280
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:11,922
Scott: Physically

281
00:19:12,163 --> 00:19:18,444
Rym: like he walked he walks up and like gets the starts talking to the crowd like so and starts telling his own stories Like out of nowhere,

282
00:19:18,565 --> 00:19:20,473
Scott: but why don't the people on the panel say who like?

283
00:19:20,514 --> 00:19:21,860
Scott: if we were doing a panel, right?

284
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,949
Scott: And someone just came up on the stage and started talking.

285
00:19:23,969 --> 00:19:26,200
Scott: we'd say who the hell are you get off the stage?

286
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:26,861
Rym: So it's got.

287
00:19:27,001 --> 00:19:33,439
Rym: most people who run panels or speak on panels are not really willing or prepared to do something like that.

288
00:19:33,962 --> 00:19:36,720
Scott: Then you how can you be on a stage if you can't even tell?

289
00:19:39,101 --> 00:19:41,429
Rym: One that is how the vast majority of people are to.

290
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:46,893
Rym: the people who are usually on stages giving panels are There because someone else got them on.

291
00:19:46,913 --> 00:19:50,548
Rym: they're not really professional Performers or panelists like we are.

292
00:19:50,588 --> 00:19:53,240
Rym: they're just on a panel because they're an expert on the thing.

293
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,011
Scott: Also, it's saying you're a comic-con.

294
00:19:55,051 --> 00:19:57,122
Scott: It's way bigger than every other con Isn't there?

295
00:19:57,183 --> 00:20:01,440
Scott: like a security or a person in the panel room who would be like who are you getting off?

296
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,244
Rym: He was the security.

297
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:06,015
Rym: He was the official staffer in charge of the room.

298
00:20:06,055 --> 00:20:07,420
Scott: There's only one staffer in the room.

299
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:22,840
Rym: Well, he he was in charge, I guess and basically as often happens You know the women on the panel didn't want to like make a scene and they were polite and they tried to sort of walk Him back into letting them talk and he just took over the whole thing.

300
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,620
Rym: It was a super shit bird and this happens kind of often at nerd cons.

301
00:20:27,022 --> 00:20:31,400
Rym: But it's sad that it happened at SDCC because how do their staff work?

302
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,808
Rym: Like is it just volunteered like shit lords?

303
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:37,420
Scott: or did I know the organization that runs the convention?

304
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,530
Scott: Is it like, you know, like what it like?

305
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:46,579
Rym: I don't know how the SDCC is organized but I this sort of crap would not fly at a convention that I have power over.

306
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:51,337
Rym: and It's kind of terrible and sad that SDCC is so unprofessional.

307
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:59,308
Scott: I get packs it's like and it's unthinkable that like an enforcer would ever like say anything other than here's where to sit or Panels over.

308
00:20:59,368 --> 00:21:00,157
Scott: everyone leave.

309
00:21:00,258 --> 00:21:11,939
Rym: Yep and I have been on panels where at Conventions where the convention staff appointed a moderator and said moderator didn't know shit and was just Basically made the panel worse as opposed to better.

310
00:21:13,421 --> 00:21:18,159
Rym: But I've mostly gotten around that by moderating my own panels when we do panels if it comes up.

311
00:21:19,302 --> 00:21:23,220
Rym: But yeah, this you can read the whole story here and the women involved kind of tell the story fully.

312
00:21:23,381 --> 00:21:27,047
Rym: I don't want to put words in their mouth, but Shame on you SDCC.

313
00:21:27,107 --> 00:21:28,914
Rym: Like this is baby's first mistake.

314
00:21:29,256 --> 00:21:30,340
Rym: Why was this guy staff?

315
00:21:30,762 --> 00:21:33,960
Rym: Why did you even let him talk on this panel?

316
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:52,838
Rym: And if you're gonna appoint someone to be a moderator or facilitator for a women in X panel Should probably have the moderator be a woman just saying anyway things Of the day.

317
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,690
Rym: So this is pretty amazing.

318
00:21:55,752 --> 00:21:58,001
Rym: This happened at SDCC.

319
00:21:58,021 --> 00:22:00,249
Scott: I was everything today is from SDCC.

320
00:22:00,711 --> 00:22:03,779
Rym: Yep, so the creators of Rick and Morty there's.

321
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:08,705
Rym: there's a famous court transcript that FARC loves the shit out of and I'm gonna link to that too.

322
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:11,614
Rym: It's just images of this.

323
00:22:11,635 --> 00:22:12,557
Rym: This is a real case.

324
00:22:13,078 --> 00:22:20,031
Rym: This is the transcript of the conversation between the courts which is the judge and Mr.

Rym: Yes, and he is accusing the court-appointed lawyer of Demanding that he sucked the court-appointed court-appointed lawyer's dick and all sorts of craziness.

329
00:22:44,171 --> 00:22:52,109
Rym: Hey, so the guy who's accused of murder is demanding a different lawyer is because he says the first lawyer Tried to make him suck his dick.

330
00:22:53,137 --> 00:23:00,681
Scott: he says that the Public defender that was assigned to defend him and make him not go to jail asked him.

334
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:12,489
Scott: He's basically saying my public defender asked me to suck his dick.

335
00:23:13,013 --> 00:23:15,330
Rym: Uh, that is the beginning of the exchange.

Scott: This one has actually harassed me.

338
00:23:21,014 --> 00:23:27,753
Rym: the best part of this like my favorite part of this whole thing is the judge being like That's fine.

339
00:23:27,793 --> 00:23:28,797
Rym: I mean it's up to you.

340

373
00:24:24,957 --> 00:24:26,986

374
00:24:27,026 --> 00:24:30,799
Scott: I mean shouldn't mr Allen go to the like the ward and not the prison?

375
00:24:30,819 --> 00:24:42,242
Rym: but my thing of the day is that the voice actors and creative team behind Rick and Morty voice acted the entire Transcripts to an animatic isn't there?

376
00:24:42,443 --> 00:24:43,830
Scott: Can't we just watch a video of the original?

377
00:24:44,592 --> 00:24:46,183
Rym: I don't believe there is a video of the original.

378
00:24:46,223 --> 00:24:47,210
Rym: There's just the transcripts.

379
00:24:47,431 --> 00:24:50,564
Scott: Is there like a nice pastel drawing by a court artist?

380
00:24:50,665 --> 00:24:51,749
Rym: I'm pretty sure there is.

381
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:53,479
Scott: I want to see what mr.

00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:54,042

00:25:01,991 --> 00:25:03,030
Rym: Let's see Allen.

00:25:04,071 --> 00:25:04,994
Rym: What was his name?

388
00:25:05,014 --> 00:25:07,583

Scott: Well, that's a pretty unique name.

392
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,390
Scott: I don't think you're gonna find a picture of the wrong person.

393
00:25:20,571 --> 00:25:21,816
Rym: It could be Denver the dinosaur.

394
00:25:22,238 --> 00:25:24,890
Rym: Well, I type Denver and it would and it recommended Fenton Allen.

395
00:25:26,031 --> 00:25:27,576
Rym: Here, here's the guy.

396
00:25:27,596 --> 00:25:31,850
Scott: It looks like a white guy with crazy eyes who did some drugs.

397
00:25:32,131 --> 00:25:35,203
Scott: Yeah, he's definitely having his mug shot taken after doing the drugs.

398
00:25:35,324 --> 00:25:41,330
Rym: Yep, and is on FARC Murder defendant Denver Fenton Allen.

399
00:25:41,511 --> 00:25:43,556
Scott: That's your thing in today a crazy white guy.

400
00:25:43,737 --> 00:25:52,981
Rym: my thing of the day is the video from SDCC of these voice actors Re-enacting the entire Transcripts and so my thing is also from SDCC.

401
00:25:53,001 --> 00:26:03,670
Scott: This guy has a pretty clever stick He basically he looks like Doctor Who and I don't know even a fan of Doctor Who and I know that he looks like One of the Doctor Who's cuz he got the bow tie in the in the curly fro hair.

402
00:26:04,311 --> 00:26:08,462
Scott: But he basically he says that he is you know Superman's little friend.

403
00:26:08,502 --> 00:26:08,763
Scott: What's it?

404
00:26:08,803 --> 00:26:10,006
Scott: What's the guy's name?

405
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:12,817
Scott: Oh The little reporter kid.

406
00:26:12,857 --> 00:26:14,790
Scott: I don't remember that guy's name Jimmy Olsen.

407
00:26:15,111 --> 00:26:20,390
Scott: He basically pretends to be Jimmy Olsen and he goes around asking people at the Comic Con a question, right?

408
00:26:20,711 --> 00:26:23,310
Scott: And he asked everyone the same question to make a funny video.

409
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:26,682
Scott: So sometimes he has a wide variety of people in this video.

410
00:26:26,722 --> 00:26:28,810
Scott: He asked a guy cosplaying as Robin.

411
00:26:29,272 --> 00:26:32,429
Scott: He asked like just normal people just at her that are at the Comic Con.

412
00:26:32,911 --> 00:26:36,152
Scott: He asked Natasha Allegri the only famous person in the thing I recognized.

413
00:26:36,373 --> 00:26:38,719
Scott: ah, right and he asked them all the same question.

414
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,290
Scott: The question he asked is who for president?

415
00:26:43,515 --> 00:26:46,449
Scott: Donald Trump or Lex Luthor?

416
00:26:47,511 --> 00:26:48,514
Rym: Definitely Lex Luthor.

417
00:26:48,795 --> 00:26:49,939
Scott: Everyone picks Lex Luthor.

418
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,624
Scott: So I don't think all right.

419
00:26:51,644 --> 00:26:55,080
Scott: So the reason I'm making this thing of the day Is because a it's a good video.

420
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:55,502
Scott: It's funny.

421
00:26:55,562 --> 00:27:04,289
Scott: Yeah, but also be Every single nerdy person on Twitter and Facebook and such who spends all day complaining about Donald Trump.

422
00:27:05,232 --> 00:27:07,059
Scott: None of the nerds are voting for Donald Trump.

423
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,850
Scott: Nobody following you is gonna vote for Donald Trump.

424
00:27:10,871 --> 00:27:11,512
Rym: Unfollow me.

425
00:27:11,813 --> 00:27:17,930
Scott: it is completely pointless for you to tweet that nonsense because you're not talking to anyone who disagrees with that nonsense.

426
00:27:18,433 --> 00:27:26,103
Scott: If you want to talk about how awful Donald Trump is Put it somewhere besides my Twitter feed because I'm not voting for him either.

427
00:27:26,624 --> 00:27:28,830
Scott: You're completely wasting your breath on this.

428
00:27:29,052 --> 00:27:29,786
Rym: God, you're gonna get.

429
00:27:32,914 --> 00:27:37,810
Scott: Keep it on Facebook where you might have crazy relatives that will be upset.

430
00:27:38,312 --> 00:27:39,075
Scott: Keep it off Twitter.

431
00:27:39,397 --> 00:27:42,289
Rym: if I had a Facebook my goal would be to get all those people to block me.

432
00:27:42,651 --> 00:27:45,802
Rym: I don't think I have any relatives who are those people on Facebook though.

433
00:27:46,404 --> 00:27:47,126
Scott: Don't know how to block.

434
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:48,879
Rym: Oh True.

435
00:27:48,899 --> 00:27:49,690
Scott: They don't know how.

436
00:27:50,632 --> 00:27:53,110
Scott: Right, so right and they feel obligated.

437
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:57,063
Scott: They can't even unfriend because there's like, you know, they're family or something.

438
00:27:57,103 --> 00:27:59,069
Scott: They can't they can't bring themselves to do that.

439
00:27:59,491 --> 00:28:01,097
Rym: I had to put it up with that a little bit over.

440
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:03,967
Scott: that's why Facebook is even more that than Twitter.

441
00:28:04,027 --> 00:28:06,716
Scott: but Twitter people Just stick to the nerdiness.

442
00:28:07,258 --> 00:28:08,443
Scott: there's no point in those tweets.

443
00:28:08,503 --> 00:28:13,169
Scott: look not a single nerd Right is on the wrong side of the board here.

444
00:28:13,451 --> 00:28:17,010
Scott: Well, that's because the choice and the only people following you on Twitter are nerds.

445
00:28:17,191 --> 00:28:25,137
Rym: how many of those nerds are gonna throw their vote away on like Jill Stein's crazy anti-vaxxer or What's his name's libertarian nonsense?

446
00:28:25,277 --> 00:28:28,390
Scott: Every one of these nerds is throwing their vote away on Lex Luthor, which is perfectly fine.

447
00:28:28,651 --> 00:28:34,201
Rym: But if we all throw our vote away on Lex Luthor in my win That's good, yeah, I would be okay with Lex Luthor.

00:28:38,757 --> 00:28:39,659

467
00:29:17,803 --> 00:29:20,090
Rym: I could imagine a horse to be more broken.

468
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:21,294
Rym: It wouldn't be a horse anymore.

469
00:29:21,315 --> 00:29:21,596
Rym: Nope.

470
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:23,503

Scott: Can it be the horse theater?

483
00:29:57,448 --> 00:29:58,030

Rym: I can waste some time if I want to that's it.

489
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:32,282
Scott: But that that wasting packs time it's like one minute of packs time is is worth as much as like a million dollars, but I There aren't that many people I can talk about that stupid series with.

490
00:30:32,563 --> 00:30:33,667
Rym: I gotta get it all out.

Rym: I gotta get it all out in one go.

494
00:30:37,243 --> 00:30:38,490

495
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:41,239

499
00:30:48,259 --> 00:30:48,941
Rym: yeah Bella.

500
00:30:49,001 --> 00:30:50,886
Rym: in every book Bella's like someone.

501
00:30:51,447 --> 00:30:52,610
Rym: Bella like disappears forever.

502
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:57,513
Rym: And then every now and then some characters like I gotta get out of town cuz shit's going crazy And they go to.

503
00:30:57,554 --> 00:30:59,907
Scott: Bella happens to be in the stable in this town.

504
00:30:59,967 --> 00:31:02,802
Rym: Yep That was like a fat chocobo.

00:31:02,943 --> 00:31:04,209
Rym: It's always there when you need him.

00:31:06,911 --> 00:31:08,395

Rym: Magfest is the next convention after packs Tiny chance one or both of us go to PAX Australia.

510
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:21,615
Rym: I haven't decided yet.

511
00:31:21,936 --> 00:31:26,030
Rym: the problem is I'm gonna be in Australia for two weeks two weeks before PAX Australia.

512
00:31:26,492 --> 00:31:30,590
Rym: So if we do PAX Australia, it means I'm gonna be home for two weeks and then fly right back to Australia.

513
00:31:31,353 --> 00:31:33,369
Rym: I can't quite take a month and a half off work.

514
00:31:35,272 --> 00:31:36,214
Scott: Kind of want to go somewhere else.

515
00:31:36,555 --> 00:31:37,497
Scott: someplace has a palm tree.

516
00:31:37,598 --> 00:31:42,651
Rym: We're thinking about doing a giant s and extravaganza in 2018.

517
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:43,113
Scott: That's fine.

518
00:31:43,153 --> 00:31:43,514
Scott: I need to 2016 2017.

519
00:31:43,514 --> 00:31:44,296
Scott: I won't go anywhere in 2016.

520
00:31:44,296 --> 00:31:45,280
Scott: I want to go someplace as a palm tree.

521
00:31:50,733 --> 00:31:51,516
Rym: Just go to slightly.

522
00:31:51,556 --> 00:31:54,128
Rym: no go to pack sauce and then go slightly further north after it.

523
00:31:55,012 --> 00:31:58,164
Rym: Yeah, maybe go to like Brisbane or Cairn or whatever.

524
00:31:58,184 --> 00:31:59,147
Rym: those places are up top.

525
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,634
Rym: There's the only two places I know up top.

526
00:32:01,458 --> 00:32:03,447
Scott: I can go someplace in this hemisphere though.

527
00:32:03,648 --> 00:32:06,889
Scott: No It's faster to get there and have more palm tree time.

528
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:16,150
Rym: We're working our way through all the anime that we already reviewed when we did our judge anime by its cover At anime Boston and this is yet one more of those flying which?

529
00:32:17,272 --> 00:32:31,340
Scott: It's in the genres of according to anime news network comedy Magic slice of life slice of life Anything that's quiet which is anything that's quiet gets a slice of life Genre attached to it if I like it.

530
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,544
Rym: I watch like four episodes.

531
00:32:32,564 --> 00:32:33,910
Rym: I think I'll watch the rest of it.

532
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:38,050
Scott: Yeah, I watched a few episodes and then they were like at the start of the season.

533
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:42,222
Scott: I started watching a bunch of shows and I finished that lost village one.

534
00:32:42,422 --> 00:32:53,418
Scott: Yeah, I think I'm one episode or two from finishing Sakamoto, I know not to finish the lost village one and I only watched a few episodes of Little Witch And I kind of wanted to watch more.

535
00:32:53,499 --> 00:32:59,842
Scott: but the thing is the show is So episodic and there wasn't a driving plot.

536
00:33:00,163 --> 00:33:04,605
Scott: that like made me eager to see the next episode Even though I enjoyed the episodes I saw.

537
00:33:04,625 --> 00:33:10,470
Scott: Yeah Make me want to watch more but that's not true.

538
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,658
Scott: I for example I was among a dial.

539
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:19,329
Scott: another show that people call a slice of life show whether it is or isn't Made me want to watch more episodes every time they came out.

540
00:33:20,173 --> 00:33:24,510
Rym: I think the problem with the show or the release the reason you're not driven to it cuz I really like the show.

541
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:33,303
Rym: I like it too is that it does move real slow and it's like every episode is 40% magic and that magic part is great.

542
00:33:33,684 --> 00:33:36,746
Rym: and 60% Making tempera.

543
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:42,365
Rym: Then exquisite and excruciating detail with some stuff that they picked off the side of the road.

544
00:33:42,866 --> 00:33:46,081
Rym: and you see like now They're washing the things now.

545
00:33:46,121 --> 00:33:47,530
Rym: They're making the tempera oil.

546
00:33:47,872 --> 00:33:50,770
Rym: Oh, hey, you can tell when the oil is ready if you put the chopsticks anyway.

547
00:33:51,213 --> 00:33:53,650
Scott: Usually when you have an episode it's a full-length episodes.

548
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:57,070
Rym: It's not a short show like only one magic thing happens per episode, right?

549
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:58,234
Scott: Well full-length episodes.

550
00:33:58,415 --> 00:34:03,495
Scott: usually even in a Simpsons episode you have two or three plots Intertwining right.

551
00:34:03,515 --> 00:34:06,366
Scott: that then come together at the end of the a and the B right.

552
00:34:06,426 --> 00:34:12,188
Scott: or in even you know Lost Village which we talked about before there's a bunch of different characters that all have plot lines to jump to.

553
00:34:12,208 --> 00:34:18,150
Scott: in Little witch there's only one characters plot line, which is the little witch's plot line, right?

554
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:19,909
Scott: The other characters are just side characters.

555
00:34:19,969 --> 00:34:26,070
Scott: So with only one plot you've got one thread and everything else is just atmosphere environment around it, which is all nice.

556
00:34:26,632 --> 00:34:28,302
Scott: It's a really nice environment and such.

557
00:34:28,362 --> 00:34:34,306
Scott: like the animations good the care Not enough stuff in one episode to carry 20 minutes.

558
00:34:35,612 --> 00:34:39,664
Scott: So you spend a lot of time watching tempera cook, right?

559
00:34:39,885 --> 00:34:46,268
Scott: or the things that happen are Done in more detail and take longer like how long did it take her to pull that?

560
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:50,606
Rym: The mandrake out of the ground is worth it because the payoff on the mandrake.

561
00:34:50,786 --> 00:34:52,154
Scott: No, that was great But it's like.

562
00:34:52,194 --> 00:34:53,844
Scott: how long did that whole scene take?

563
00:34:53,864 --> 00:34:54,610
Scott: you could have done that soon.

564
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:58,829
Rym: She's trying to weave the farm and she's like and pulls the weed out and falls in her butt and goes, right?

565
00:34:59,292 --> 00:35:00,650
Rym: I almost pulls the weed out again.

566
00:35:01,791 --> 00:35:06,550
Scott: I almost wish that like the dude character or maybe the mom or the little the sit.

567
00:35:06,891 --> 00:35:08,255
Scott: You know the cousin a little cousin.

568
00:35:08,556 --> 00:35:12,349
Scott: we're like also a main character and you could just get two plots in one episode.

569
00:35:12,389 --> 00:35:17,125
Rym: Yep, or Those characters just need to have like even if you don't see their plots.

570
00:35:17,165 --> 00:35:18,190
Rym: They just need more going on.

571
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:20,001
Rym: They're all just really because they're all.

572
00:35:20,021 --> 00:35:20,323
Scott: they're all.

573
00:35:20,443 --> 00:35:21,570
Scott: everyone is a side character.

574
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,277
Scott: They only come in and come out and come in.

575
00:35:23,338 --> 00:35:28,675
Scott: They're never like the main focus, you know All the thing though.

576
00:35:28,735 --> 00:35:33,295
Scott: to their credit though every single character even the minute every character is great Like.

577
00:35:33,315 --> 00:35:36,073
Scott: there's no characters who were like all lame character I don't care about.

578
00:35:36,093 --> 00:35:39,686
Rym: like there's a suspicious girl who's worried about the fact that she knows about which is.

579
00:35:39,907 --> 00:35:44,205
Rym: there's the little sister Who's dubious but also into it the witch's sister who's like the ultimate?

580
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:46,815
Scott: Yeah She ever.

581
00:35:46,976 --> 00:35:54,210
Rym: their relationship reminds me of a like 90% deluded version of Lena inverse and her older sister, right?

582
00:35:55,251 --> 00:35:56,778
Scott: You get like the the one episode.

583
00:35:57,039 --> 00:35:58,786
Scott: weird guy who cut like weird.

584
00:35:58,826 --> 00:36:01,556
Scott: which dude, you know Who's magical and doesn't say anything.

585
00:36:01,596 --> 00:36:02,218
Scott: who comes in?

586
00:36:02,279 --> 00:36:03,383
Scott: It's not like a no face.

587
00:36:03,423 --> 00:36:05,490
Rym: You've got the harbinger who is just funny.

588
00:36:05,652 --> 00:36:09,196
Rym: I like him a lot because he's like, uh Come on, I'm not scary.

589
00:36:09,236 --> 00:36:09,718
Rym: What's up?

590
00:36:09,758 --> 00:36:10,321
Scott: Come on.

591
00:36:10,381 --> 00:36:10,642
Rym: Come on.

592
00:36:10,663 --> 00:36:11,306
Rym: Let me in.

593
00:36:11,326 --> 00:36:12,089
Scott: Yeah, that's the guy.

594
00:36:13,013 --> 00:36:16,810
Rym: Yeah, it's surprising how emotive his face is for being just two holes.

595
00:36:17,191 --> 00:36:20,889
Rym: Yeah, a little owl nose of the girl who accidentally turned herself into a dog.

596
00:36:22,533 --> 00:36:25,229
Scott: It's like every single character is like way cool.

597
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:28,718
Scott: You know There's just not enough stuff happening to where.

598
00:36:28,738 --> 00:36:38,639
Scott: I can like keep my attention on it for more than an episode at a time now Eccentric family and on the surface moves similarly slow.

599
00:36:38,819 --> 00:36:40,924
Scott: eccentric family is but a better show.

600
00:36:40,944 --> 00:36:46,830
Rym: eccentric family is dense with Things other than just what happens in the episode.

601
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:52,369
Scott: Okay, first of all eccentric family has like four different plot lines going on right to pay attention to.

602
00:36:53,533 --> 00:36:56,202
Scott: It also has tons of mystery and suspense and action.

603
00:36:56,222 --> 00:36:58,510
Rym: Those are things that this show does not have.

604
00:36:58,731 --> 00:37:00,396
Scott: No, it doesn't have any of those things right?

605
00:37:00,457 --> 00:37:01,922
Scott: This show is like you.

606
00:37:01,942 --> 00:37:04,210
Scott: just take one slice of eccentric family.

607
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:10,470
Rym: Yeah, right the cute tanuki part only and the rest of it is just let's temper this stuff on the side.

608
00:37:11,113 --> 00:37:17,840
Scott: Don't take the ones from the utility pole because the show is really good But it's a show only for a certain mood.

609
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,548
Scott: It's not a show for all seasons.

610
00:37:19,909 --> 00:37:23,650
Rym: Yep It's a show you put on like sitting there idle before you like cook dinner or something.

611
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:23,971
Rym: And even

612
00:37:24,011 --> 00:37:41,958
Scott: though it's a show that takes place in the summer because it's all about this witch who goes To stay with her family a different part of her family during the summer, right or whatever Only temporarily or something this show I think is best watched in winter when you're cooped up in the house Yeah, and you want a summer vibe?

613
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:44,970
Scott: Yep, cuz why did you put the show out in the summer?

614
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:48,484
Scott: I guess because it goes with summer but now watch it in the winter to warm yourself up.

615
00:37:48,704 --> 00:37:54,450
Rym: I would also say that the show Reminds like on the surface detail like just looking at the cover art and everything.

616
00:37:54,993 --> 00:38:08,210
Rym: It reminds me of some days dreamers, which when I saw it way back I was like, ooh, that's gonna be a kind of show I like and I remember some days dreamers was so boring Didn't go anywhere and I just didn't care and I watched one episode.

617
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:16,866
Rym: I just never watched the rest of it and I feel like this is Better and that I will watch the rest of it, but I don't know when I'll finish watching.

618
00:38:16,886 --> 00:38:18,552
Scott: Yeah, I don't know when It's sort of like.

619
00:38:19,135 --> 00:38:20,861
Scott: it's a really good.

620
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:22,085
Scott: It's like butter.

621
00:38:22,326 --> 00:38:23,370
Scott: It's really delicious.

622
00:38:23,751 --> 00:38:24,394
Rym: You don't want to eat.

623
00:38:24,434 --> 00:38:28,910
Scott: just it got spread way thin and it's gonna take you a long time to eat it all.

624
00:38:29,351 --> 00:38:35,210
Rym: Yep, and meanwhile, there's like hero Academy or one punch man or all those other shows that it's just cocaine right in your face.

625
00:38:35,693 --> 00:38:37,464
Scott: Yeah, I mean one punch man.

626
00:38:37,504 --> 00:38:39,874
Scott: I watched like Faster than it came out.

627
00:38:39,975 --> 00:38:42,221
Rym: Yeah, right the show is if I didn't read it.

628
00:38:42,302 --> 00:38:42,643
Rym: It's just.

629
00:38:43,224 --> 00:38:45,190
Rym: it's pleasant and inoffensive.

630
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:57,110
Rym: Mmm, nothing real bad to say about it, except it's not particularly Like another show that we've complained about a long time ago cosine or Jimbo that you start to watch it.

631
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:58,554
Rym: It's also slow.

632
00:38:58,575 --> 00:39:01,022
Scott: Yeah, but it doesn't have characters you care about.

633
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:03,450
Rym: Yeah, I think nothing happens.

634
00:39:04,534 --> 00:39:06,809
Scott: You can't tell what's happening and you don't care.

635
00:39:07,352 --> 00:39:11,714
Scott: So it's like the same pace as guys know Jimbo only with good stuff It's not a bad like.

636
00:39:11,754 --> 00:39:17,541
Rym: imagine if every character because they know your Jimbo were awesome But the show otherwise went the same pace that it went.

637
00:39:17,601 --> 00:39:18,586
Rym: I probably would have watched it.

638
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:19,068
Rym: Mm-hmm.

639
00:39:19,872 --> 00:39:21,080
