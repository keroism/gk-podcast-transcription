1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,567
Rym: It's Monday, February 8th, 2016.

2
00:00:10,567 --> 00:00:10,829
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,841 --> 00:00:14,360
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,940
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight, why Twitter can't make money.

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,938
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,184
Rym: So I finally did it.

7
00:00:25,389 --> 00:00:27,620
Rym: It was one of those shit or get off the pot moments.

8
00:00:28,722 --> 00:00:32,512
Rym: So I purchased two things in the last 12 hours because...

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,580
Scott: If something you purchase is worthy of opening, but it must be expensive.

10
00:00:38,843 --> 00:00:40,420
Rym: They're moderately expensive, but they're technology.

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,171
Rym: But there's the thing that I've noticed.

12
00:00:43,311 --> 00:00:45,360
Rym: It bothers me when other people do it.

13
00:00:46,222 --> 00:00:48,260
Rym: And I vowed to never do it myself.

14
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,786
Rym: Where you have a complaint.

15
00:00:50,168 --> 00:00:57,120
Rym: Like, I'm doing X and I'm a professional at X. But there's a problem doing X. And yet there is why.

16
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:13,300
Rym: A piece of technology that will actually fix X. If you're a professional and you need Y to do X because your profession is X. And you don't buy Y and you keep complaining about how annoying it is to do X. You are not actually a professional.

17
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:24,100
Scott: Usually that's a situation where this problem should have been solved by adding the feature of that accessory to the original thing, right?

18
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,968
Rym: Well, yeah, there's a lot of nuance there.

19
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:27,477
Rym: Or it might be like, I mean, in the 90s.

20
00:01:28,301 --> 00:01:30,228
Rym: Or even actually not that long ago.

21
00:01:30,449 --> 00:01:31,473
Rym: Want to edit video?

22
00:01:31,814 --> 00:01:33,360
Rym: Well, here are your options.

23
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,374
Scott: It's like saying, man, driving this car sucks.

24
00:01:35,434 --> 00:01:36,260
Scott: I sure wish it had brakes.

25
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,488
Scott: Well, why didn't you buy brakes?

26
00:01:37,669 --> 00:01:39,120
Scott: It's like the car should include brakes.

27
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:47,303
Rym: Yeah, but what about, say, I want to do chroma keying, but it's 1920.

28
00:01:47,303 --> 00:01:48,880
Scott: That doesn't exist in 1920.

29
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,058
Rym: Well, actually, it kind of did.

30
00:01:50,407 --> 00:01:50,700
Rym: Really?

31
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,014
Rym: Yeah, but it was not done much the same way we do it now.

32
00:01:54,074 --> 00:01:55,440
Rym: But similar things could be done.

33
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,169
Rym: Chemical processes and such.

34
00:01:57,209 --> 00:01:58,280
Rym: I was reading a lot about that stuff.

35
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,700
Scott: I guess you could do something with a completely black background and light only the front things and then run the film through again.

36
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,060
Rym: Yeah, or you could probably do masks and all sorts of stuff.

37
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:08,539
Rym: That's what I'm saying.

38
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,569
Rym: Yeah, automate a mask by overexposing one part all the way up.

39
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:13,575
Rym: Then you have the mask and then you can re-expose.

40
00:02:14,338 --> 00:02:15,100
Rym: All sorts of nonsense.

41
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,260
Rym: So anyway, I was editing the antenna videos, you know, the Patreon thing, and a bunch of PAX videos and everything.

42
00:02:22,181 --> 00:02:25,500
Rym: And I keep having to shuttle and jog around the videos.

43
00:02:25,741 --> 00:02:26,704
Rym: And I'm doing what I always do.

44
00:02:26,744 --> 00:02:28,992
Rym: I'm futzing around with the mouse and keyboard and back and forth.

45
00:02:29,353 --> 00:02:31,160
Rym: And it's just not that fun.

46
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:33,720
Rym: And then I remembered that jog wheels exist.

47
00:02:33,941 --> 00:02:35,059
Scott: What's your mouse sensitivity?

48
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:36,500
Rym: It's not a matter of that.

49
00:02:36,901 --> 00:02:37,930
Scott: You can set your mouse wheel.

50
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,060
Scott: How many clicks is a click?

51
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,607
Rym: Oh, no, it's not that matter.

52
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:42,500
Rym: I can click one frame at a time.

53
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,389
Rym: The difference is a nice jog wheel.

54
00:02:45,429 --> 00:02:48,500
Rym: Like at RIT in the labs, we had like editing consoles.

55
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,271
Rym: Imagine like a big fucking wheel with a lot of weight to it.

56
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:53,816
Rym: You can sort of spin and slide.

57
00:02:53,877 --> 00:02:54,800
Rym: It's really comfortable to use.

58
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,039
Scott: Does your mouse wheel unlock and spin like woosh?

59
00:02:57,501 --> 00:02:58,308
Rym: This one does not.

60
00:02:58,328 --> 00:02:59,619
Rym: I have another mouse that does.

61
00:03:01,622 --> 00:03:03,780
Scott: I feel like you just wanted to waste money on something fancy.

62
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:08,074
Rym: No, because I remember editing video with a jog wheel and with a shuttle ring around it.

63
00:03:08,134 --> 00:03:09,740
Rym: And it was just a lot faster.

64
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,100
Scott: You're in that much of a hurry.

65
00:03:12,621 --> 00:03:13,340
Rym: Yeah, actually.

66
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,920
Scott: I feel like that isn't something that's so much of a pain that the mouse wheel's no good.

67
00:03:17,562 --> 00:03:32,199
Rym: Well, I got to the point where I have a lot of video to edit that involves a lot of like the Utena stuff, especially now, is mostly me jogging around inside of a bunch of like whole episodes of Utena to find individual frames and like exact

68
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:32,500
Scott: cut off points.

69
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:37,440
Scott: I mean, there are definitely specialized tools to make things easier that are useful.

70
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:43,220
Scott: But I feel like that is a borderline, you know, not necessary.

71
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:44,998
Rym: You've never really put together...

72
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,772
Scott: Well, it's a borderline garlic press.

73
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:47,840
Scott: That's all I'm saying.

74
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,069
Rym: You've never put together a complex video.

75
00:03:50,089 --> 00:03:52,520
Rym: Look at the timeline of all these stupid Utena things you'll see.

76
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:01,920
Rym: But anyway, I thought, hey, maybe, you know, a long time ago I looked for these things and I didn't buy one because they were all thousands of dollars or they were just a mouse.

77
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:02,655
Rym: Like there was no...

78
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,319
Scott: No, you can buy just a wheel now.

79
00:04:04,801 --> 00:04:07,518
Rym: Yeah, so I went around looking online and most of the wheels...

80
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,620
Scott: I've actually seen some Kickstarted at some points.

81
00:04:09,961 --> 00:04:17,700
Rym: Yeah, and I researched all those and basically what I discovered is that there are a few things that are super good, but they're still expensive.

82
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:25,480
Rym: There's things that work pretty well, but they're not better enough than just a mouse to justify spending any amount of money on them.

83
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:35,700
Rym: And then I found one thing that was $80 and it appears that everyone else who edits video, even like professionals, pretty much used that one.

84
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,526
Rym: And I asked around and everyone was like, oh yeah, that one's great.

85
00:04:38,128 --> 00:04:42,060
Rym: So I bought it and it's going to make my editing life a lot easier.

86
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,824
Scott: You're going to have fun playing with a knob.

87
00:04:43,864 --> 00:04:49,760
Scott: At least there's one thing you can say about buying that garlic press, well borderline garlic press, not quite as bad as a garlic press.

88
00:04:50,841 --> 00:04:56,100
Scott: That makes it kind of okay and that is you can play Breakout or Pong with it.

89
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:00,600
Rym: Yeah, actually, the ulterior motive, I want to see if I can play Kaboom with it.

90
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,638
Scott: You can play Warlords with it.

91
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:05,340
Rym: I might be able to set it up and then we can add some Atari games to our panel at night.

92
00:05:05,682 --> 00:05:08,180
Scott: Anything with a dual purpose gets, you know, gets a pass.

93
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,440
Rym: But the other thing is I actually finally bought a new phone.

94
00:05:12,165 --> 00:05:12,719
Scott: Oh, okay.

95
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:18,680
Rym: The Sony Xperia Z5 Compact came out in America with every LTE channel that I care about.

96
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:19,764
Rym: Legit, like.

97
00:05:19,804 --> 00:05:22,140
Rym: I can buy it for real, not some gray market nonsense.

98
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,900
Rym: I can buy it basically direct from Sony on Amazon or B&H or whatever.

99
00:05:29,524 --> 00:05:31,169
Rym: And I did my last cursory research.

100
00:05:31,711 --> 00:05:34,680
Rym: Apparently Marshmallow came out and they all upgraded just fine.

101
00:05:35,303 --> 00:05:38,178
Scott: But does it have any weird stuff or is it pure unadulterated?

102
00:05:38,781 --> 00:05:42,700
Rym: So I really dug into what Sony does because of course it's weird stuff.

103
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,260
Rym: There's only one line of phones that doesn't have any weird stuff.

104
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,980
Rym: And the Sony stuff is... Well, like Nexus phones.

105
00:05:52,321 --> 00:06:02,100
Rym: Yeah, I looked into also the new small Apple phones and I'm not going to wait for the unicorn to come out because my Nexus 5 is a little hardware compromised.

106
00:06:02,582 --> 00:06:06,260
Rym: I was kind of counting down the minutes before it actually does die.

107
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,360
Rym: And the fact that this thing is waterproof, I've been complaining about how there's no good small phone forever.

108
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:22,020
Rym: And while this is not a perfect phone, it is literally the best Android hardware on the market in the entire world today, full stop.

109
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,440
Scott: So you bought the least smelly poop?

110
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,580
Rym: Yeah, I bought the best Android hardware.

111
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,920
Scott: So I just buy the gold, Jerry?

112
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:27,354
Scott: Gold.

113
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:40,420
Rym: Yeah, so this is an experiment because if it's good, if it works, if my feeling that having a small phone with good hardware is better than the alternative, then I was right all along.

114
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:47,920
Rym: And if I'm wrong, I can resell it for almost as much as I bought it for and just buy the iPhone 5 SE whatever when it comes out.

115
00:06:48,981 --> 00:06:54,940
Scott: Apple's doing this thing now where you sort of pay for your iPhone every month and you can upgrade your phone every year.

116
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,020
Rym: So just always have the current iPhone.

117
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:01,560
Scott: You just always have the newest phone and you get Apple Care forever also is like free.

118
00:07:02,101 --> 00:07:03,820
Scott: Instead of paying 100 bucks a year for whatever.

119
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,280
Scott: So if anything happens to it, you're fine.

120
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,800
Rym: So actually the main thing was because it's waterproof, that's increasingly a problem for me.

121
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,720
Rym: Like I kind of need a waterproof phone.

122
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,880
Scott: Well, the iPhone is actually more waterproof than you would expect.

123
00:07:19,226 --> 00:07:19,440
Rym: Oh, yeah.

124
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,820
Scott: It's not super waterproof.

125
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,720
Scott: Apple don't advertise that fact, but it's they keep making it more and more waterproof every release.

126
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,380
Rym: Yeah, but they don't get the like certification.

127
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,120
Scott: They're not going to say it's waterproof because they want to fuck you if you get it in the water.

128
00:07:31,341 --> 00:07:34,600
Rym: Well, also they don't want to deal with the edge case of, yeah, it's pretty much waterproof.

129
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,719
Scott: They actually said iPhones are waterproof now.

130
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,820
Scott: People would be dumping that shit in the swimming pool and be like, hi, bro.

131
00:07:41,368 --> 00:07:41,580
Rym: Yeah.

132
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:43,520
Rym: So I'm getting my new waterproof phone.

133
00:07:43,722 --> 00:07:45,199
Rym: I'm still not going to throw in the pool.

134
00:07:45,762 --> 00:07:47,339
Rym: I'm still not going to shower with it.

135
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,418
Scott: I'm going to take it in the ocean.

136
00:07:49,921 --> 00:07:51,680
Rym: Actually, it says specifically no salt water.

137
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,259
Scott: Okay.

138
00:07:52,445 --> 00:07:52,531
Scott: Yeah.

139
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,059
Rym: There is a fully waterproof version, but I don't need that.

140
00:07:55,247 --> 00:07:55,439
Rym: Yeah.

141
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:08,160
Rym: Anyway, but knowing it, especially because my, my nexus five, you know, it's kind of damaged because I dropped it on those rocks in Hong Kong and it works fine, but it has a hole right in the bottom that water could just get in.

142
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,378
Scott: Isn't that where the USB goes in?

143
00:08:09,701 --> 00:08:10,398
Rym: USB goes down here.

144
00:08:11,105 --> 00:08:11,760
Scott: Not on the bottom.

145
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:12,980
Rym: The front is cracked.

146
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,076
Rym: Like where the screen, cause that's where I hit the rock with it.

147
00:08:15,942 --> 00:08:17,239
Scott: Why are you doing that?

148
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,448
Rym: Because I was running in the mountains and I needed a GPS.

149
00:08:20,468 --> 00:08:24,960
Rym: so I didn't get lost cause I'm in fucking Hong Kong and I had literally, it's like a little island.

150
00:08:24,982 --> 00:08:25,093
Rym: Yeah.

151
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:36,000
Rym: So I literally the day before the trip or gotten my new nexus five because my nexus forward finally died and the nexus five for like five bucks a dozen in Hong Kong.

152
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:40,320
Rym: So the nexus five was just a little bit bigger than the nexus four.

153
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,020
Rym: So it wouldn't fit in the armband that I put on when I ran with it.

154
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:44,855
Rym: So I had to carry it.

155
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,939
Rym: So yeah, I don't like big phones.

156
00:08:48,245 --> 00:08:48,799
Rym: So this is it.

157
00:08:49,001 --> 00:08:53,580
Rym: Either you're, I'm going to talk about how great it is to have a small phone again or Android is dead.

158
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:56,600
Rym: You're going to find out in about a week cause the phone arrives tomorrow.

159
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,420
Scott: All right, so I got, I got an open event.

160
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,880
Scott: It's, you know, I don't know if someone's probably gonna give me shit about this, but anyway.

161
00:09:02,223 --> 00:09:02,859
Scott: Ooh, all right.

162
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:09,660
Scott: I've always given people shit who have pains and I'd be like, I don't have any pains.

163
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:16,800
Rym: You know, that is true Scott, because many times when you've had a pain or I've had a pain, if I have a pain, I'll just take an aspirin and I'll be fine.

164
00:09:17,061 --> 00:09:20,160
Rym: If you have a pain, you'll bitch about it, but you won't take aspirin.

165
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,799
Rym: You'll just sit there bitching about it.

166
00:09:22,986 --> 00:09:24,579
Scott: Uh, yeah, but I usually don't have pains.

167
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:29,640
Scott: And I also tell people like, you know, like people got back pains and I'd be like, Hey, I just hunch over.

168
00:09:29,821 --> 00:09:30,519
Scott: I never have any pain.

169
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,540
Scott: Look at you standing up straight hurts all the time.

170
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,340
Scott: You shouldn't stand up straight.

171
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,598
Scott: Just hunch and be comfortable like me.

172
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:34,983
Rym: Yeah.

173
00:09:35,004 --> 00:09:35,378
Rym: You know what?

174
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,319
Rym: That's just because your back's messed up because you've been hunched for so long.

175
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:39,760
Rym: Right.

176
00:09:40,241 --> 00:09:45,520
Scott: Now suddenly of course the comeuppance that was expected came sooner than expected.

177
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,116
Rym: Back pain?

178
00:09:46,321 --> 00:09:46,877
Scott: My back hurts.

179
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:47,898
Rym: Upper or lower?

180
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,960
Scott: In a weird, it hurts in one spot, like on the left in the middle.

181
00:09:51,302 --> 00:09:53,599
Rym: Left in the middle, like just south of your shoulder blade?

182
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,720
Scott: Uh, a little, I mean quite a bit south, but not super south.

183
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:01,299
Rym: Cause you know that every study says that the cure for lower back pain is fuck you.

184
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,051
Rym: Yeah.

185
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,519
Rym: There's just not that you're done, but there's nothing you can do about it.

186
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,640
Scott: It's not really lower.

187
00:10:05,845 --> 00:10:06,460
Scott: It's in the middle.

188
00:10:06,601 --> 00:10:09,880
Scott: But yeah, I mean, I know that the, there is no care for back pain.

189
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,540
Rym: Why don't you get some chiropractic homeopathy?

190
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,517
Scott: No, I'm not going to do that.

191
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,480
Scott: Uh, yeah, it hurts.

192
00:10:16,505 --> 00:10:17,000
Rym: All the time?

193
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:17,760
Rym: Like you go to a doctor?

194
00:10:18,443 --> 00:10:22,440
Scott: Uh, I didn't go, I mean it only started hurting like maybe halfway through two days ago.

195
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,060
Rym: Oh, maybe it's an acute pain.

196
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,719
Rym: Maybe you just like, it still hurts though.

197
00:10:26,184 --> 00:10:26,940
Rym: Moved it a weird way.

198
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,358
Rym: It changes.

199
00:10:27,822 --> 00:10:28,379
Rym: We're humans.

200
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:29,760
Rym: We're over 30.

201
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,840
Rym: The reality is sometimes you wake up and something just hurts for a few days.

202
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:33,640
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

203
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:39,280
Rym: Like I can't tell if I'm hurt because I hurt myself anymore or if I'm hurt because I'm over 30.

204
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:39,716
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

205
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:43,460
Rym: Cause sometimes one day, like a month ago I woke up, my elbow, my right elbow just hurt.

206
00:10:44,063 --> 00:10:47,340
Rym: And I kept hurting for like two weeks and then it just stopped hurting.

207
00:10:48,201 --> 00:10:52,320
Rym: So all I could think was, well, I guess that was pain, like injury and not old.

208
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:52,594
Scott: Right.

209
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,120
Scott: So anyway, so it started hurting.

210
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,300
Scott: I went to bed, I woke up and hurt more and I said, Oh, why is it still hurt?

211
00:10:57,563 --> 00:10:57,688
Scott: Uh oh.

212
00:10:58,801 --> 00:11:02,740
Scott: So then I took one dose of Tylenol and it made no difference.

213
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,006
Scott: Right.

214
00:11:05,741 --> 00:11:08,320
Rym: I would, I would go, you know, most people use other drugs.

215
00:11:08,521 --> 00:11:11,880
Rym: I actually still use aspirin 90% of the time if I take a pain medicine.

216
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:16,437
Scott: So then this morning when I got to work, right, it was like, you know, I was moving pretty slow.

217
00:11:17,061 --> 00:11:27,100
Scott: So for the first time my entire life, I went into the closet at the office and I took, instead of acetaminophen, there was also ibuprofen, ibuprofen is my number two, man.

218
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:32,240
Scott: So I took, I think it said to take one, I took one that also did nothing.

219
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,220
Scott: So, uh, but then I guess I took it at nine in the morning.

220
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:38,879
Scott: How long does it usually take to work?

221
00:11:39,246 --> 00:11:39,578
Rym: I don't know.

222
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,413
Scott: Like an hour, 40 minutes.

223
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,016
Scott: Okay.

224
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,120
Scott: It definitely didn't work because I was hurting the same amount until like maybe three.

225
00:11:45,945 --> 00:11:46,860
Rym: And then it stopped hurting.

226
00:11:47,388 --> 00:11:47,600
Scott: Yeah.

227
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:53,079
Scott: I mean it didn't stop hurting, but it hurts less now than it did at nine, but it didn't change really at all until three.

228
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,240
Rym: So what was one, the actual dose, how many milligrams did you take?

229
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,159
Scott: It said to take one.

230
00:11:57,343 --> 00:11:57,819
Scott: Oh, okay.

231
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:58,659
Scott: On the bottom.

232
00:11:58,941 --> 00:12:00,260
Rym: I read the instructions.

233
00:12:01,003 --> 00:12:02,460
Rym: You're using unitless measures.

234
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:02,997
Rym: One what?

235
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:04,720
Rym: One ibuprofen.

236
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:10,080
Scott: One pill from the bottle of generic orange stuff that was in the closet at the office.

237
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,080
Rym: Like how many milligrams?

238
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,660
Rym: Like you want 600 milligrams of grifenicin, but you want like 60 milligrams of pseudo ephedrine.

239
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,060
Scott: I mean, I can go look at it again tomorrow, but I don't really care.

240
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:24,140
Scott: I took the recommended dosage of one and nothing had, nothing affected my pain until three.

241
00:12:24,821 --> 00:12:33,257
Rym: And it still is definitely uncomfortable, but from what I've read, back pain is one of the things where unless you get dangerous painkillers, they really don't do anything for it.

242
00:12:33,341 --> 00:12:33,919
Scott: That makes sense.

243
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,800
Rym: Other pains like you had a headache, like half a dose of aspirin.

244
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,640
Rym: That thing's gone.

245
00:12:37,961 --> 00:12:38,519
Rym: Unless it's migraine.

246
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:46,500
Rym: I'm saying if you did, if, if somehow the, uh, the overmanage got a headache, then anyone's got a robot body.

247
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,680
Scott: I mean, I've, you know, I've been waiting one patiently, but you know, the clock's ticking here.

248
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,620
Scott: I need the robot body a little sooner than expected.

249
00:12:52,820 --> 00:13:00,340
Rym: It's just, it's always interesting that you're a very pro robot body yet you won't use existing body technology to make yourself feel better.

250
00:13:00,681 --> 00:13:05,358
Rym: Like if I'm sick, I'll just take whatever drugs fully aware of the side effects.

251
00:13:05,539 --> 00:13:07,159
Rym: because why feel pain?

252
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,100
Rym: Why feel discomfort?

253
00:13:09,683 --> 00:13:10,580
Scott: Here's your problem, right?

254
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,137
Scott: See if you take drugs, I've only got this biological body and odds are it's all I'm going to have.

255
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:20,666
Scott: It's not, we know what the side effects are of taking some drugs, you're going to fuck up this biological body.

256
00:13:20,686 --> 00:13:24,140
Scott: and then what Scott, how was the aspirin going to get a robot body, right?

257
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,459
Scott: I don't have to worry about fucking up a biological body.

258
00:13:26,861 --> 00:13:30,256
Rym: Scott, have you ever like tried to flash a bios and just shit's broken?

259
00:13:30,316 --> 00:13:38,000
Rym: now you're going to flash your butt bios and your butt's just going to like fall off and have an error code on it.

260
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,120
Scott: I got a robot body.

261
00:13:39,381 --> 00:13:40,260
Scott: It's like you're set.

262
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,119
Scott: You can just go.

263
00:13:41,241 --> 00:13:41,779
Scott: I don't give a shit.

264
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:45,040
Rym: I'm going to get some butt malware and I guess butt malware is just food poisoning.

265
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,580
Scott: I'll just reinstall my whole OS from scratch just like I do with my computer.

266
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,679
Scott: My computer has a lot less problems than my biological body does.

267
00:13:54,323 --> 00:13:55,199
Rym: My, you know what?

268
00:13:55,721 --> 00:13:57,459
Rym: I was, I was going to say, yeah, I agree with you.

269
00:13:58,262 --> 00:14:00,920
Scott: I can take care of a, of, you know, technological body.

270
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,580
Scott: I can't really do my, even doctors who are specialists.

271
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:07,180
Rym: You know, if I go to the Scott, the only reason you bring me a broken computer.

272
00:14:07,441 --> 00:14:15,360
Scott: And you bring a broken body to a hospital cannot restore that broken body to perfection, but I can restore that computer to right Scott.

273
00:14:15,581 --> 00:14:16,539
Rym: So here's one up on you.

274
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,460
Rym: I'm going to bring you a computer from 34 fucking years ago.

275
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,439
Rym: Restore that shit.

276
00:14:20,641 --> 00:14:20,892
Scott: I can.

277
00:14:21,321 --> 00:14:22,680
Scott: I got two GS in my closet.

278
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,235
Scott: It works great.

279
00:14:23,961 --> 00:14:25,128
Scott: It's better than your computer.

280
00:14:25,148 --> 00:14:27,100
Scott: works better than your brand new computer.

281
00:14:27,392 --> 00:14:27,560
Scott: Yeah.

282
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,540
Rym: It's not going to render any video anytime soon.

283
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,420
Scott: If I spend a little money on eBay, I can make it work so good.

284
00:14:32,968 --> 00:14:33,159
Rym: Yeah.

285
00:14:33,222 --> 00:14:33,658
Rym: But you know what?

286
00:14:33,781 --> 00:14:39,779
Rym: The other thing is when you take, when you take your computer to the computer doctor, he just pulls out all the shit that's broken and just replaces it.

287
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:40,076
Scott: Yeah.

288
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,200
Scott: So that's why it's great to have a robot body.

289
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:47,638
Rym: When I broke that rib at magfest a couple of years ago, no one like, that's why biological bodies suck.

290
00:14:48,122 --> 00:14:49,039
Scott: And I don't want one.

291
00:14:51,021 --> 00:14:55,317
Scott: If you could just, you know, do instant part replacement without any problems,

292
00:14:55,959 --> 00:15:10,998
Rym: but Scott, you know what it's like, you know, when you got a raid and one of the discs dies, so the equivalent of taking some aspirin, like if you could just stop using the drive and just not have access to that data until it rebuilds, or you can let it start rebuilding and keep using the data.

293
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,800
Rym: The danger is minuscule negligible, but you have access to your data.

294
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:23,260
Rym: So if I got to say a headache, like just headache happens, I could either suffer through it for no reason or take an aspirin to not feel it.

295
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:30,180
Rym: And as long as I remember that, Hey, Rym, you had a headache, you don't feel it now, but you're basically turned off that error warning.

296
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,240
Rym: You acknowledge that error in the alert console.

297
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,880
Scott: You might fuck up your stomach with that aspirin.

298
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:36,900
Rym: Uh, well, I don't seem to have that problem.

299
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,499
Rym: That's not, everyone has those problems.

300
00:15:38,861 --> 00:15:41,679
Rym: And if you're going to have that problem, take ibuprofen instead, you just still have that problem.

301
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,440
Rym: Take Tylenol.

302
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,045
Scott: Yeah.

303
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:55,820
Scott: I mean, Tylenol is definitely my go-to because I feel like Tylenol causes more systemic damage than either aspirin or ibuprofen causes damage to what the liver, the liver, which in someone who doesn't drink is mad strong liver is ready for beaten.

304
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:57,920
Scott: My liver is like not done any work ever.

305
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:01,160
Scott: So it's ready for all kinds of acetaminophen clearing action.

306
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:04,760
Rym: Liver does way more than deal with alcohol.

307
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,699
Rym: Alcohol is a relatively minor part.

308
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,020
Scott: If I have to compare, right?

309
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:16,978
Scott: If I'm going to, if I have to go to battle with one of my internal organs and I can send either my stomach, my liver, or if I have to go to battle with an internal

310
00:16:17,038 --> 00:16:21,540
Rym: organ, I'm going for the appendix, gallbladder, something I can just fucking cut out and get rid of.

311
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,319
Scott: Just fire it.

312
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,239
Rym: If you've got a bad ram steak, you just pull it out and you're good to go.

313
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:29,680
Scott: Maybe my liver is going to win more battles and has more hit points than the others.

314
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:32,019
Scott: So if I'm going to do some damage, I'll take it in the liver.

315
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:32,720
Rym: We get what?

316
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,339
Rym: I'll allocate.

317
00:16:33,561 --> 00:16:37,179
Scott: I'll allocate my three right torso damage to the liver.

318
00:16:38,421 --> 00:16:40,160
Rym: Just don't worry about the crit chance.

319
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:40,466
Scott: Yeah.

320
00:16:40,781 --> 00:16:42,080
Scott: I'm not going to get a crit chance on the liver.

321
00:16:42,782 --> 00:16:44,250
Scott: My stomach though, might get a crit.

322
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:45,759
Scott: and then, you know, bad news.

323
00:16:46,241 --> 00:16:49,154
Rym: So I got a tech news, which is one of those funny tech news.

324
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:55,400
Rym: is it's, it's the classic line of didn't know X existed until Facebook announced they're shutting X down.

325
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,920
Rym: So a bunch of my coworkers were flipping out because they're like, Oh my God, Facebook shut down parse.

326
00:17:02,282 --> 00:17:04,220
Scott: And I was like, well, they didn't shut it down yet.

327
00:17:04,621 --> 00:17:06,817
Scott: They're going to shut it down shutting it down a year from now.

328
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:08,700
Rym: Uh, Oh, slash that's funny.

329
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,819
Rym: It's for those working in the ass business as a service.

330
00:17:13,701 --> 00:17:15,858
Rym: So parse shut down is going to shut down.

331
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:26,319
Rym: And so I didn't know what parse was, but the headline told me immediately because what they, what it basically said was Facebook never wanted to host apps to begin with.

332
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,656
Rym: They literally bought it.

333
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,780
Rym: So developers could use the Facebook login full stop.

334
00:17:31,389 --> 00:17:31,839
Rym: They bought it.

335
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:41,937
Rym: It's one of those situations where a large company like Facebook bought another company's thing to literally get one of its features and fuck all the rest of that nonsense that came along with it.

336
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:53,420
Scott: So this, so parse was this thing that sort of started to solve like this one small problem and they over engineered it and ended up building what is known as infrastructure as a service.

337
00:17:54,080 --> 00:18:01,027
Scott: So basically let's say you're writing like an iOS app and you know, you need some sort of backend.

338
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:02,800
Scott: that is not in the app itself.

339
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,539
Scott: Like maybe for example, you're making a video game and you want to store a database of high scores, right?

340
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:11,440
Scott: And you don't want to use like Apple game center.

341
00:18:11,521 --> 00:18:13,720
Scott: You want to have like your own high score database somewhere.

342
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:19,700
Scott: Or maybe you want to have your game players like log in and have a friends list and you know, do these sorts of things.

343
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:32,860
Rym: Now the traditional way to do that was you have hosting in the sky somewhere and you were done and you write an application and you put the, you host the application on some servers and that application probably has a bunch of like component applications.

344
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:39,380
Rym: Like you write your application, but then you've also got like my SQL running behind it and Apache and a bunch of nonsense.

345
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:43,340
Scott: You actually build a web service of some kind or an internet service.

346
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,479
Scott: And there's a whole Linux server, an application, you write one and you run it.

347
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:47,760
Rym: Yeah.

348
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:51,480
Rym: But on top of an entire Linux server on a hardware, right?

349
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:56,540
Rym: And then a little revolution was servers as a service or you know, like an Amazon instance.

350
00:18:56,661 --> 00:18:57,980
Rym: So you run a whole Linux server.

351
00:18:58,425 --> 00:18:59,379
Rym: It's just virtualized.

352
00:18:59,440 --> 00:18:59,530
Rym: Yeah.

353
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,280
Rym: You don't have to worry about the actual, what Scott's talking about is way beyond that.

354
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:08,320
Scott: What parse does is basically you don't have to write an application or run servers or do anything.

355
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:14,580
Scott: They pretty much just provide a generic web user interface, customizable infrastructure.

356
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,440
Scott: So you can just be like going to make a high score list.

357
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:23,857
Scott: You just go to parse and be like, well, username, high score, login password, you know, do this, do that.

358
00:19:24,421 --> 00:19:33,980
Scott: And now you can write your game and in the game that you write, you know, while you're writing your iOS code and see see objective C or what's the other thing that they made?

359
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:45,700
Scott: Uh, you know, that Swift, right, you just, you just include, you know, the parse library and now you can use the parse API to communicate with this infrastructure.

360
00:19:45,842 --> 00:19:47,220
Scott: Now you don't have to build Linux servers.

361
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,240
Scott: You don't have to write an application.

362
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:48,960
Scott: You can do anything.

363
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,399
Scott: You don't have to set up databases.

364
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:50,958
Rym: Yup.

365
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:54,700
Rym: You just, I mean, Amazon has a bunch of this stuff too is your infrastructure.

366
00:19:55,041 --> 00:20:00,630
Rym: Like you can use, you can like, you can run an Amazon instance and run like Postgres on it or you just use Amazon's database.

367
00:20:02,183 --> 00:20:02,578
Rym: There's no server.

368
00:20:02,861 --> 00:20:07,880
Scott: We use parse at work, but actually the only thing we use it for is to send iOS notifications.

369
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:12,100
Scott: We don't use it for anything else so we can replace it with something else.

370
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,019
Rym: Yeah, there's a lot.

371
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,229
Rym: I think there's a notification thing on Amazon.

372
00:20:15,249 --> 00:20:17,520
Rym: you could actually just use, uh, maybe.

373
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,860
Scott: But you know, there's plenty of alternatives.

374
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:19,300
Rym: Yeah.

375
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,480
Scott: But yeah, uh, Facebook shutting it down.

376
00:20:23,081 --> 00:20:27,562
Scott: And I guess, you know, it really bothers me that there's like a market for a lot of these things.

377
00:20:27,602 --> 00:20:33,700
Scott: because on the one hand, you know, this all really started with like the Heroku, which is like, it's one thing to sell hosting, right?

378
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,720
Scott: Cause that's all Amazon is really doing is selling hosting.

379
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:36,334
Scott: Right.

380
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,720
Scott: It's like, well, except I don't have a data center.

381
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:43,080
Scott: I want to pay to use computers in your data center and I don't really care what CPUs are in them.

382
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,439
Scott: I just want computers that run.

383
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:50,360
Rym: But that's not super scalable because then you still have to make your application like deal with multiple servers and all that nonsense.

384
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,800
Rym: You have to monitor that shit, dude.

385
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,120
Scott: Right.

386
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:58,859
Scott: It's like a lot of these things, it gets to a point where it's like, it's one thing to pay someone to take care of something for you.

387
00:20:59,402 --> 00:21:04,080
Scott: It's another thing to pay someone to, so that you don't have to know something, right?

388
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:13,319
Scott: It's like people use Heroku so that they could write a Ruby on rails app without having to know anything about databases or Unix or anything like that.

389
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,600
Scott: And so there is way too much and getting way too little.

390
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:24,155
Rym: So there is a counterpoint there though, like a lot of the Amazon stuff, like especially use like the elastic beanstalk or like some other like basically spinning up code on the fly.

391
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:33,678
Rym: So if someone like uploads a video to your web server and then it automatically spins up, however many threads it needs out in the cloud somewhere to do like the transcoding or whatever.

392
00:21:34,381 --> 00:21:37,780
Rym: So that way you can scale automatically and only pay for your load.

393
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,859
Scott: You can also do that no matter what.

394
00:21:41,322 --> 00:21:42,140
Scott: Because spinning up.

395
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,480
Scott: You can just do that with EC2 instances.

396
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:50,718
Scott: You can say, you know, cloudwatch, if CPU usage on any of these machines gets too high, launch another machine with this AMI.

397
00:21:51,161 --> 00:21:52,280
Rym: Yeah, so that might take.

398
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,800
Scott: Elastic beanstalk just does the same thing.

399
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:57,820
Scott: Even if you use elastic beanstalk, you still have to know about Unix and computers.

400
00:21:58,164 --> 00:21:59,460
Scott: You're not outsourcing your knowledge.

401
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:06,239
Rym: Yeah, but you're outsourcing having to scale on a per computer basis, like not outsourcing having to know anything.

402
00:22:06,589 --> 00:22:06,800
Rym: Exactly.

403
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:18,120
Rym: I've noticed just in my industry, you know, finance, there are companies that use services like all this Amazon nonsense because they realize that it has a scaling or a feature.

404
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:24,079
Rym: There's something it does that is useful to them, but they know how to do that thing on a server.

405
00:22:24,241 --> 00:22:27,740
Scott: People who use parse for like its full infrastructure as a service.

406
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,680
Scott: People do that because they don't know how to make an infrastructure.

407
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:37,300
Scott: They don't know how to set up an administrator, a Unix server or write an API or use a database.

408
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:42,179
Scott: And they just want to make a web, an iOS app or something and not have to know any or.

409
00:22:43,504 --> 00:22:46,820
Rym: Or they use it for a rapid time to market to get a thing that works.

410
00:22:47,402 --> 00:22:50,680
Rym: And if it gets big, they'll deal with replacing that with real infrastructure later.

411
00:22:51,061 --> 00:22:53,659
Rym: Why waste effort if you just want to see if the thing's going to work?

412
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,958
Scott: But this is why you get things like the node JS.

413
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:00,597
Scott: It's like people learn JavaScript and HTML and CSS, and they don't want to have to know anything else.

414
00:23:00,981 --> 00:23:12,611
Scott: So let's just well, we'd rather do a bunch of work and develop this whole node JS thing so that we can also write JavaScript on the server instead of just learning, because that's even though that's more effort, they don't.

415
00:23:12,852 --> 00:23:21,320
Scott: for some reason, people like against learning, they would rather do a whole bunch of work to use a language they already know in a different way than just learn something new.

416
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:28,224
Scott: Hey, if someone else does that work, but you're it's basically someone else programming language in the world.

417
00:23:28,345 --> 00:23:35,720
Rym: on the server also, it's a great idea, at least even the people who are node evangelists are like, yeah, don't do any serious processing on that thing.

418
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,403
Rym: And I'm like, so what?

419
00:23:36,644 --> 00:23:41,780
Rym: So you've got a backend and a backend and a front end now, two of which are JavaScript.

420
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:42,622
Rym: Why?

421
00:23:43,726 --> 00:23:46,960
Rym: Why can't your JavaScript front end talk directly to your job or whatever back?

422
00:23:47,161 --> 00:23:50,453
Scott: Seems like there's so many, you know, all the hotness is now.

423
00:23:50,514 --> 00:23:52,120
Scott: these days aren't new things.

424
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:59,040
Scott: They're just people reinventing the wheel in different ways so that they don't have to learn the existing ways to do a thing.

425
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:01,519
Scott: It's like, I don't want to have to learn how to make an API.

426
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,010
Scott: I just want to.

427
00:24:03,091 --> 00:24:03,940
Scott: I'll just use parse.

428
00:24:04,463 --> 00:24:06,020
Scott: I'll pay money to avoid learning.

429
00:24:06,683 --> 00:24:07,840
Rym: Yeah, but that's the thing.

430
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:16,259
Scott: I'll do a whole bunch of work rewriting, you know, making JavaScript work on a server so I don't have to learn Python or Ruby or C or anything like or go.

431
00:24:16,681 --> 00:24:19,899
Rym: So today, randomly, I was we have like a Matlab thing I'm working on.

432
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:20,782
Rym: So I wanted to.

433
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:26,120
Rym: I wanted to make a web server thingy just to kind of try some stuff out because I had some rest interface in the backend.

434
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,000
Rym: So I spun up Flask and that totally just worked immediately.

435
00:24:31,601 --> 00:24:32,283
Rym: And it was pretty cool.

436
00:24:33,025 --> 00:24:41,900
Rym: And I had recently done some node stuff and the comparison between working with the two was stark, to say the least.

437
00:24:42,542 --> 00:24:52,680
Rym: But there is a difference between the people who are doing what you're saying, who use services like this to avoid knowledge versus people who use it because they understand what it offers and have a reason.

438
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,837
Rym: I think the latter is probably more successful, but also more rare.

439
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:05,422
Scott: I also, you know, even if you have a valid use for parse, like you just want to get something up quick and you're going to replace that part later, like you plan to replace it later anyway.

440
00:25:05,443 --> 00:25:13,779
Scott: I really don't like, you know, on Amazon, we only use things, at least I only use things that can be swapped because they have a standard API.

441
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:17,180
Scott: For example, if you use Amazon RDS, it's just MySQL or just Postgres.

442
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,460
Scott: You can cancel it and just use a MySQL server and you're good.

443
00:25:20,961 --> 00:25:29,060
Scott: If you use Amazon SES, which is their email service, well, we just talk to it using SMTP so we could replace that with like postfix or sendmail like tomorrow.

444
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,420
Scott: Yeah, but if we were to use Amazon, I don't know what's one of the weird things they have.

445
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,540
Rym: Like Elastic Beanstalk is one of the weirder ones.

446
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,680
Scott: Well, no, you use like Amazon simple queue service.

447
00:25:39,187 --> 00:25:39,495
Rym: Oh, yeah.

448
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:48,139
Scott: You can't just swap that out for RabbitMQ or ZeroMQ because it has its own API, so you'd have to recode a whole bunch of stuff to switch away from that.

449
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,479
Scott: It's not using a standard AMQP interface.

450
00:25:50,540 --> 00:26:01,217
Rym: There's a more fundamental thing, though, is if the company that provides your ass infrastructure, I'm going to start calling it that from now on, is not a company that sells ass.

451
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:05,580
Rym: Do not trust it with your ass like Amazon.

452
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,899
Scott: Don't trust anyone with your ass.

453
00:26:07,061 --> 00:26:08,507
Rym: Amazon is an infrastructure.

454
00:26:08,627 --> 00:26:15,800
Rym: as a service company like that's like that, like AWS, like that is like that's I consider Amazon just be a hosting provider.

455
00:26:15,981 --> 00:26:20,720
Rym: Yeah, but I but all that, like at least they provide that stuff as a primary business.

456
00:26:21,142 --> 00:26:24,100
Rym: So it's not the worst idea to build a business on top of it.

457
00:26:24,462 --> 00:26:27,840
Rym: But Facebook primarily provides racist uncles.

458
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:32,260
Rym: So I don't I wouldn't really build my ass infrastructure on top of racist uncles.

459
00:26:33,981 --> 00:26:44,680
Scott: Just don't use, you know, if you're paying for someone to do something for you technologically, it should be something that you can swap out that you pay Linode for a Linux machine while you can just swap it out for your own Linux machine.

460
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:52,660
Scott: And if you decide not to take that advice, you develop your thing on Parse using the Parse API, you're wholly dependent on Parse's continued existence.

461
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,859
Scott: You can't just swap it out.

462
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:54,221
Rym: Yeah.

463
00:26:54,261 --> 00:26:57,600
Rym: See also people who use unpublished APIs of larger companies.

464
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:07,020
Rym: Yeah, don't do that or do it and just realize that you literally built your business on top of a, I don't know, collapsing pile of sand and rotten wood.

465
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:07,702
Scott: All right.

466
00:27:07,722 --> 00:27:13,800
Scott: So, you know, once in a while someone comes out with like a chat bot that's like, whoa, it's the new impressive chat bot.

467
00:27:14,462 --> 00:27:15,125
Scott: Wow.

468
00:27:15,627 --> 00:27:20,639
Scott: And it's slightly more impressive than the previous chat bots and talking about Turing tests and A.I.s and stuff.

469
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,101
Scott: Right.

470
00:27:21,908 --> 00:27:23,420
Scott: And then people forget about it.

471
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,453
Scott: It's cute for a few days.

472
00:27:24,474 --> 00:27:24,839
Scott: The end.

473
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:25,160
Scott: Right.

474
00:27:25,882 --> 00:27:31,259
Scott: Well, apparently in China there is a new chat bot called Shao Ice.

475
00:27:33,025 --> 00:27:33,511
Scott: I can't tell.

476
00:27:33,531 --> 00:27:34,240
Scott: I think it's Shao Ice.

477
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:40,699
Scott: Anyway, this chat bot, you can just chat it up on a Weibo, which is like, I guess, Twitter or Facebook of China.

478
00:27:42,065 --> 00:27:42,326
Scott: Right.

479
00:27:43,231 --> 00:27:45,080
Scott: And apparently like it's in Chinese.

480
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,420
Scott: You can't you can't talk to it unless, you know, Chinese.

481
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:53,000
Scott: But this article all about it has a lot of transcripts from it that are in English.

482
00:27:53,501 --> 00:27:54,187
Scott: They translated.

483
00:27:54,368 --> 00:27:55,517
Scott: You can see how amazing it is.

484
00:27:56,401 --> 00:28:04,019
Scott: And, you know, it uses the same sort of like, you know, you know, machine learning that has been all the rage these days.

485
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:04,620
Rym: Yeah.

486
00:28:05,162 --> 00:28:14,460
Scott: This thing, I think, is notable in that it is it is not just one step ahead of the previous chat bot that was exciting, which I guess was Eliza maybe or something.

487
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:14,903
Scott: I don't know.

488
00:28:15,286 --> 00:28:16,960
Rym: Well, so there's a side conversation.

489
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:21,640
Scott: I actually have this chat bot is maybe like five steps ahead of the previous chat bot.

490
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,820
Rym: I have a bunch of articles saved.

491
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:25,780
Rym: Actually, I want to do a main like a show on this in the future.

492
00:28:26,103 --> 00:28:28,000
Rym: Of the reverse uses of chat bots.

493
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:37,164
Rym: There are chat bots that are designed to predict what you would say to people so we can respond automatically for you on social media and be indistinguishable from what you would have said anyway.

494
00:28:37,827 --> 00:28:41,120
Rym: That's the real awesome and scary shit about chat bots.

495
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:41,621
Scott: Yeah.

496
00:28:41,641 --> 00:28:50,040
Scott: But anyway, this chat bot is, you know, it's just like this person to talk to and is at least five steps ahead of any previous chat bot I've seen.

497
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:57,807
Scott: So I think developments in this, you know, pass the Turing test area are perhaps accelerating.

498
00:28:58,231 --> 00:28:59,280
Rym: Oh, not just turned.

499
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:05,440
Rym: I think machine learning had a recent subtle acceleration because Go wasn't solved.

500
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,713
Rym: But there's that A.I.

501
00:29:07,161 --> 00:29:09,000
Rym: that basically no human can beat now.

502
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:13,926
Rym: Like people were saying that wouldn't happen in our lifetime and it appears that it already happened.

503
00:29:14,047 --> 00:29:15,800
Scott: Well, people are just taking the Google stretch.

504
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,418
Scott: You know, Google recently opened up their what are they held to the name?

505
00:29:19,439 --> 00:29:19,943
Scott: the stupid thing?

506
00:29:19,964 --> 00:29:20,939
Scott: I keep forgetting the name of it.

507
00:29:21,201 --> 00:29:23,940
Rym: Oh, yeah, because I just read the article and we were talking about it the other day.

508
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:24,341
Scott: Yeah.

509
00:29:24,361 --> 00:29:29,344
Scott: You know, their machine learning thing that I'll probably remember the name of later in the show.

510
00:29:29,385 --> 00:29:32,926
Rym: I can go find the article on the go thing because I was arguing with someone on YouTube about it.

511
00:29:32,946 --> 00:29:38,760
Scott: Basically, Google's strategy has always been to replace the fact that, like, look, we can't code the logic of a brain.

512
00:29:39,281 --> 00:29:42,380
Scott: Let's just get so much data that it doesn't matter.

513
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,840
Scott: And that's the strategy these days.

514
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:44,362
Rym: And that's work.

515
00:29:44,422 --> 00:29:51,659
Scott: I mean, look, chess is not just get so much data that we don't have to think of a fancy algorithm because that's too hard to do.

516
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:56,380
Scott: It's much easier to just get like 10 terabytes of data and do a dumb ass algorithm.

517
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,121
Rym: Yeah.

518
00:29:57,141 --> 00:29:59,660
Rym: Well, like, look, chess is not solved yet.

519
00:30:00,321 --> 00:30:03,000
Rym: Humans cannot beat machine learning at chess.

520
00:30:03,421 --> 00:30:04,084
Rym: Full stop.

521
00:30:04,124 --> 00:30:07,200
Rym: That's why you never hear about human versus computer contest anymore.

522
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,813
Rym: Humans cannot win ever.

523
00:30:10,082 --> 00:30:11,200
Rym: Go hit that same point.

524
00:30:11,302 --> 00:30:12,398
Rym: Now, allegedly, like go.

525
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,780
Rym: Humans have nothing to add because humans just can't do it anymore.

526
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:18,600
Rym: Humans have no more contributions to the world of go.

527
00:30:19,263 --> 00:30:20,299
Rym: Except among other humans.

528
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,380
Scott: I don't know if that's true yet, but it's almost true.

529
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,959
Rym: Well, it's basically that A.I.

530
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,039
Rym: is getting tested now.

531
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:30,880
Scott: But if you were going to draw a line on the timeline of history and when that became true, we're probably underneath the line somewhere.

532
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,669
Rym: Yeah.

533
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:34,260
Rym: So maybe there has been an increase.

534
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,920
Rym: Maybe I should start checking on like the current state of machine learning.

535
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:43,239
Scott: So there was actually Google put up a free machine learning course and I went and I watched like the first YouTube video.

536
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:49,178
Scott: And that is definitely not a course that I think they lied about.

537
00:30:49,198 --> 00:30:56,041
Scott: the prerequisite knowledge that was required because the guy basically asked you a question and he didn't.

538
00:30:56,363 --> 00:31:01,720
Scott: It's one of those teachers that I hate, like my 10th grade chemistry teacher who asked the question before teaching you anything.

539
00:31:02,522 --> 00:31:04,939
Scott: They asked the question and then they answer it afterwards.

540
00:31:05,242 --> 00:31:06,640
Scott: And it's like, fuck you, teach me.

541
00:31:06,861 --> 00:31:07,774
Scott: And then ask me dumbass.

542
00:31:09,023 --> 00:31:09,345
Scott: It's like.

543
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:11,140
Scott: it's like, what's one plus one?

544
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,380
Scott: You're like, what the hell is plus?

545
00:31:12,926 --> 00:31:14,279
Scott: And then afterwards, like it's two.

546
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,568
Scott: This is what plus is.

547
00:31:15,588 --> 00:31:16,720
Scott: And it's like, go fuck yourself.

548
00:31:17,445 --> 00:31:18,339
Scott: I can't sit through this.

549
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:23,300
Scott: Teach me what plus is, you know, show me one plus one, then ask me two plus three.

550
00:31:23,421 --> 00:31:24,297
Rym: That's how you teach.

551
00:31:24,941 --> 00:31:25,263
Scott: All right.

552
00:31:25,564 --> 00:31:29,462
Scott: Well, maybe I couldn't learn machine learning from that machine learning course.

553
00:31:29,482 --> 00:31:32,280
Rym: There's something ironic in there somewhere.

554
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:32,803
Scott: I had to.

555
00:31:32,863 --> 00:31:34,740
Scott: I have to find another source of learning machine.

556
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:37,000
Rym: So actually talking about learning, this is a total tangent.

557
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:42,889
Rym: But there's a bunch of research kind of recently, you know, the idea that different humans have different styles of learning.

558
00:31:43,552 --> 00:31:44,840
Rym: that might be all bullshit.

559
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:49,200
Rym: There might be like objectively superior ways for people to learn.

560
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:53,100
Rym: And people who learn by other methods are just worse at learning overall.

561
00:31:53,980 --> 00:32:01,899
Rym: And people who like some like if you have someone who's good at learning and someone who's bad at learning, the person who's bad at learning might do a little bit better with an alternative method.

562
00:32:02,222 --> 00:32:06,740
Rym: But the person who's good at learning will do objectively worse, like far worse with that same alternative method.

563
00:32:07,182 --> 00:32:11,120
Rym: And there's a whole bunch of studying recently around how humans learn.

564
00:32:11,201 --> 00:32:12,559
Rym: There might be some objective truths.

565
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,880
Scott: I think it pretty much just comes down to do you want to learn?

566
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,980
Scott: If you want to learn, you're going to want to learn.

567
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:19,860
Rym: No, actually.

568
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,555
Scott: So you're saying that people can learn really well.

569
00:32:22,575 --> 00:32:23,259
Scott: who don't want to?

570
00:32:24,643 --> 00:32:26,499
Rym: No, there are people who want to learn but can't.

571
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:27,503
Scott: That's true.

572
00:32:27,865 --> 00:32:30,320
Rym: That's and that's the most probably the most tragic thing in the world.

573
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,080
Scott: But I think if you don't want to learn, you ain't going to learn no matter what method.

574
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:38,740
Rym: Human learning is probably just some complex and fuzzy machine learning.

575
00:32:38,901 --> 00:32:41,800
Scott: So you just you get enough data.

576
00:32:42,121 --> 00:32:42,342
Rym: Yeah.

577
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:45,680
Rym: I mean, we're just like fuzzy logic nonsense machines.

578
00:32:51,662 --> 00:32:53,760
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

579
00:32:54,021 --> 00:32:57,140
Rym: So I found this video and then I realized it was APIC guy.

580
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,380
Rym: We featured his some of his stuff in the past.

581
00:32:59,621 --> 00:33:03,834
Scott: I wanted to use a few of his videos for things of the day, but I don't want to use the same guy so much.

582
00:33:03,895 --> 00:33:04,220
Rym: Exactly.

583
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,880
Rym: Especially because a lot of the ones that of his that are my favorite.

584
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:10,440
Rym: Well, anyway, this video actually kind of stood out.

585
00:33:10,681 --> 00:33:19,882
Rym: He took one of those like crapo APC like backups with like the lead acid battery, like, you know, here's your UPS to keep your computer going for like five minutes after the power goes out.

586
00:33:21,106 --> 00:33:28,379
Rym: And he drills it apart and talks about how to make it a hundred times better and how poorly made these things are.

587
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:44,780
Rym: And it teaches you a lot like if you are young and you might go into IT and you might need to know about like these, like in data centers, like why DC power and power buses and like AC and all like that world and why it actually matters to know about that stuff.

588
00:33:45,461 --> 00:33:54,800
Rym: This video will pretty much summarize everything you need to know in that regard about why maybe we don't actually want AC power within our data centers.

589
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,400
Rym: I mean, pretty much anything modern runs on DC power.

590
00:33:58,782 --> 00:34:00,360
Rym: It's just DC power is hard to distribute.

591
00:34:00,902 --> 00:34:06,942
Rym: AC power is kind of shitty at moving anything other than like a heater or a motor that spins.

592
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:14,099
Scott: I mean, usually in a data center at the you know, on each rack, you've got, you know, an AC to DC converter and all the computers take DC.

593
00:34:14,681 --> 00:34:14,781
Scott: Right.

594
00:34:14,821 --> 00:34:16,509
Rym: No, usually you've still got.

595
00:34:17,453 --> 00:34:19,159
Scott: you have little power supplies in each rack.

596
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:19,681
Scott: Yes.

597
00:34:19,721 --> 00:34:25,716
Rym: You have a PDU that distributes the AC power to all the power supplies that are done suboptimal.

598
00:34:26,821 --> 00:34:31,261
Scott: So it is and even Google and Facebook and the really big data centers doing it that way too.

599
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:38,820
Rym: So some data centers will use direct DC power, but it is such a fucking pain in the ass to deal with that stuff.

600
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:39,723
Rym: Oh, it's almost.

601
00:34:40,085 --> 00:34:43,641
Rym: it ends up being cheaper for a lot of people to deal with all the problems of AC.

602
00:34:43,822 --> 00:34:47,239
Scott: But I feel like so many power supplies is like so many more points of failure.

603
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:47,902
Rym: Yeah.

604
00:34:48,205 --> 00:34:49,920
Rym: Welcome to the world of data center management.

605
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,799
Rym: You want to learn the whys of this?

606
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,539
Rym: Go to college for like five years anyway.

607
00:34:54,821 --> 00:34:58,500
Rym: So this video is fascinating if you don't know about this stuff.

608
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:08,843
Rym: And even if you do know about it, like a lot of a lot of people think if they have like a UPS that the computer is running off the battery and the battery is just constantly being charged.

609
00:35:09,185 --> 00:35:11,520
Rym: That is not how most shit tier UPS is work.

610
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,320
Scott: No, the battery just sits around.

611
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:17,140
Rym: But the way this guy modded this one, it does work that way now.

612
00:35:17,302 --> 00:35:18,380
Rym: And it's way better.

613
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,480
Scott: Wouldn't the battery, though, like lose its life?

614
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,820
Rym: It's lead acid batteries.

615
00:35:21,921 --> 00:35:23,119
Rym: They don't lose their life ever.

616
00:35:23,442 --> 00:35:24,420
Rym: Really invincible.

617
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,539
Scott: A lead acid battery can just keep getting recharged and used forever.

618
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,680
Rym: Why do you think your car battery lasts forever unless you break it or something?

619
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,200
Scott: Car batteries don't last forever.

620
00:35:32,582 --> 00:35:33,293
Rym: They last for long.

621
00:35:33,354 --> 00:35:33,740
Rym: God damn.

622
00:35:33,941 --> 00:35:36,640
Rym: They last longer than any lithium ion battery you're ever going to see.

623
00:35:37,262 --> 00:35:37,344
Scott: Sure.

624
00:35:37,996 --> 00:35:38,180
Scott: Anyway.

625
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,299
Rym: Anyway, this video is great.

626
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:45,899
Scott: So way back in the day, like the 80s, there were these computer learn how to, you know, these computer learning books.

627
00:35:46,402 --> 00:35:47,800
Scott: And maybe you've recognized them.

628
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,538
Scott: If you see the cover, they are published by U.S.

629
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,560
Scott: Usborne Children's Books.

630
00:35:53,183 --> 00:35:56,480
Scott: They had books such as Machine Code for Beginners, Computer Programming.

631
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:07,644
Scott: They also had books that had like listings like here's a program in basic type this into your, you know, ZX Spectrum, and then it'll run and you'll be able to play an adventure game.

632
00:36:08,048 --> 00:36:09,360
Rym: I used to get magazines.

633
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,759
Rym: A lot of magazines had like basic programs in them.

634
00:36:12,221 --> 00:36:13,420
Rym: So I didn't have a computer.

635
00:36:13,702 --> 00:36:16,240
Rym: So I was always desperate to be able to type them into something.

636
00:36:16,881 --> 00:36:20,820
Scott: So Usborne has two modern computer books to teach kids about computers.

637
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:28,200
Scott: Those books are Code for Beginners Using Scratch, which is this really cool MIT sort of learning computer language thing.

638
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:28,823
Scott: It's kind of fun.

639
00:36:28,843 --> 00:36:31,920
Scott: And another book called Lift the Flap Computers and Coding.

640
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,720
Scott: But all them old books from the 80s, they have them on their website.

641
00:36:36,862 --> 00:36:38,139
Scott: You just click and you see them.

642
00:36:38,401 --> 00:36:39,005
Scott: They're just there.

643
00:36:39,025 --> 00:36:41,420
Scott: They have a copyright notice.

644
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,540
Scott: And the way the copyright licenses is that they own the copyright.

645
00:36:44,843 --> 00:36:45,900
Scott: It's not Creative Commons.

646
00:36:46,642 --> 00:36:48,879
Scott: You can't redistribute these PDFs on your own.

647
00:36:49,362 --> 00:36:54,544
Scott: But as long as you come to their website and click, you can get a PDF and use it all you want for yourself.

648
00:36:55,026 --> 00:36:58,181
Rym: I kind of want to go there and copy paste some old basic programs into it.

649
00:36:58,201 --> 00:36:58,542
Rym: I don't know.

650
00:36:58,603 --> 00:37:03,584
Scott: if you copy paste out of a PDF into a, you know, I could do it old school.

651
00:37:03,745 --> 00:37:05,899
Rym: I could do it old school and literally just type the code in.

652
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:06,221
Scott: Yeah.

653
00:37:06,241 --> 00:37:08,600
Scott: I mean, come and take my Apple 2GS and we'll type the code in.

654
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,188
Rym: Maybe we should.

655
00:37:09,229 --> 00:37:09,820
Rym: That'd be there.

656
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:12,839
Rym: Let's let's we should make a Let's Play video where we do that.

657
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:21,040
Scott: The problem with my Apple 2GS is not that it's broken in any way, is that I only have five and a quarter inch floppy drives and five and a quarter inch floppies.

658
00:37:21,541 --> 00:37:25,922
Scott: You can get a three and a half inch floppy drive for it and use three and a half inch floppies.

659
00:37:26,323 --> 00:37:29,656
Scott: I do not have those and they are not the price they are on.

660
00:37:29,777 --> 00:37:31,230
Scott: eBay is not really worth it to me.

661
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:31,331
Rym: Yeah.

662
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:36,304
Rym: We'd get like a few weeks worth of entertainment that we'd probably not use it ever again.

663
00:37:36,324 --> 00:37:47,920
Scott: And the best method of getting software into one of those is a method I have available, which is I plug USB cable into my computer, then I have a little converter and then it turns into a modem cable.

664
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:54,359
Scott: And then I go to the Apple 2 and I say, hey, Apple 2, you're getting a phone call, take all the data you're getting from the phone call and run it.

665
00:37:54,641 --> 00:38:02,898
Scott: And then on my computer, I say, hey, computer, see this file I downloaded from the Internet that contains Apple 2 software, send it over the USB cable ATAT.

666
00:38:04,561 --> 00:38:15,285
Scott: I also have another method, which is where I download a file of Apple 2 software and I turn it into a WAV file because, you know, a lot of them were just on cassette tapes or whatever.

667
00:38:15,708 --> 00:38:17,500
Scott: You know, modem is just audio, too, right?

668
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:17,969
Scott: Doesn't matter.

669
00:38:17,989 --> 00:38:18,479
Scott: Yeah.

670
00:38:18,741 --> 00:38:30,225
Scott: And then I take a headphone cable from my iPhone and I plug it into the in the microphone hole on the Apple 2 and I press play on the wave file and turn the volume all the way up.

671
00:38:30,346 --> 00:38:30,730
Rym: I still have.

672
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:31,760
Rym: well, I don't have many more.

673
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:32,606
Rym: My mom probably has them.

674
00:38:32,646 --> 00:38:34,440
Rym: I have cassette tapes that have programs.

675
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:45,744
Scott: I can even do it by opening Safari on my iPhone and typing in a URL of a WAV file and pressing play and download something from the Internet over the Wi-Fi directly into my Apple 2.

676
00:38:45,744 --> 00:38:50,860
Rym: So in the moment we were just at Pac South, three panels.

677
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,440
Rym: I have video of four panels.

678
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,940
Rym: One of them is already on YouTube.

679
00:38:55,501 --> 00:38:56,340
Rym: I was scared yet.

680
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:04,939
Rym: A discussion of horror and games with Chris Straub, Dave Allen from Penny Arcade, Alex Stacey from Loading Ready Run and Alana Pierce from IGN or Peace, I think she said.

681
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:18,245
Rym: But the rest of the videos from Pac South, other than this one, will not be up until I upload the antenna episode 14, which I am editing fiercely as fast as I can with your with your knob.

682
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:19,880
Rym: The knob is going to come tomorrow.

683
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:20,685
Rym: Oh, my God.

684
00:39:20,705 --> 00:39:22,739
Rym: I might just video myself using the knob.

685
00:39:23,324 --> 00:39:24,439
Rym: I'm kind of excited about the knob.

686
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,900
Rym: Rym loves fiddling knob.

687
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:29,460
Rym: I really should have bought that knob before, but the knob used to be way expensive.

688
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:29,906
Rym: It's actually.

689
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:30,639
Rym: So get this.

690
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:31,539
Rym: The knob was cheaper.

691
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,920
Scott: How long is he going on about his knob?

692
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,507
Rym: I'm going to go talk about it.

693
00:39:35,587 --> 00:39:38,201
Rym: once I get the knob, I can do a let's play of me using the knob.

694
00:39:38,724 --> 00:39:41,920
Rym: So much because remember, we have a Patreon and we have a goal.

695
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:46,480
Rym: And if we hit that goal, you're going to get a bunch of videos of how I do GeekNights.

696
00:39:47,443 --> 00:39:52,700
Rym: Like here's a video of me editing like the Utena video, more money than you.

697
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,320
Rym: Don't give him so much video of me playing with my knob.

698
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,740
Rym: You're not going to be able to deal with it.

699
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,466
Scott: You don't want that.

700
00:39:57,506 --> 00:39:59,360
Scott: Don't give him your money if you're already giving your money.

701
00:39:59,721 --> 00:40:00,765
Scott: Stop.

702
00:40:01,207 --> 00:40:02,272
Rym: I got a very tender.

703
00:40:02,312 --> 00:40:03,940
Scott: make much better use of that money.

704
00:40:04,344 --> 00:40:05,700
Rym: I just got a very tender thank you.

705
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,800
Rym: That was addressed to both of us in the Patreon campaign.

706
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:09,543
Scott: Don't do that.

707
00:40:09,624 --> 00:40:11,440
Rym: I'm someone who is very happy about GeekNights.

708
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,182
Scott: No, don't.

709
00:40:12,222 --> 00:40:15,120
Rym: Very, very proud to be contributing to our cause.

710
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:18,700
Scott: That person has a problem with priorities in life.

711
00:40:19,061 --> 00:40:22,420
Rym: Otherwise, we're going to be a MAGFest like next weekend.

712
00:40:23,623 --> 00:40:25,057
Rym: Like that's coming up real quick.

713
00:40:26,581 --> 00:40:28,656
Rym: I mean, yeah, yeah.

714
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,680
Scott: Two weekends from next weekend.

715
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,740
Rym: Not this weekend where we have nothing but next weekend.

716
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:34,282
Scott: That's right.

717
00:40:35,046 --> 00:40:38,220
Rym: We're going to be on between the two of us, like seven goddamn panels.

718
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,219
Scott: I don't know which ones I'm on.

719
00:40:39,682 --> 00:40:41,079
Rym: I don't remember which ones I'm on.

720
00:40:41,161 --> 00:40:42,178
Scott: Can you make an itinerary for me?

721
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:45,116
Rym: I'm going to show up and I'm going to go to the staff room and I'm going to.

722
00:40:45,256 --> 00:40:46,282
Rym: I'll just be like, John St.

723
00:40:46,322 --> 00:40:50,079
Rym: John, let's wander in kind of drunk and be like, so where do I have to be?

724
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,300
Scott: Yeah, I need an itinerary.

725
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,198
Rym: Point me at the room and I'll show up.

726
00:40:53,641 --> 00:40:55,379
Scott: I need someone to give me an itinerary because I don't know.

727
00:40:56,001 --> 00:40:59,100
Rym: At least we're doing the same panels that we did at PAX.

728
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,480
Rym: I said the Atari one.

729
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:03,500
Rym: We can just totally change it up because it's just the Atari one.

730
00:41:03,521 --> 00:41:04,100
Rym: We can do whatever.

731
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:05,980
Rym: So I think we'll change some games.

732
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,260
Rym: If my knob works, we're going to talk about some kaboom.

733
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,460
Scott: You're going to bring your knob to magfest.

734
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:12,179
Rym: I'm bringing my knob to magfest if it works for kaboom.

735
00:41:12,601 --> 00:41:14,419
Rym: OK, we'll see if it works for kaboom.

736
00:41:15,541 --> 00:41:18,800
Rym: So you might have noticed me bitching on Twitter, which is kind of ironic.

737
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:23,240
Rym: And the whole I mean, rest in peace, Twitter was trending globally for a while.

738
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:29,600
Rym: But basically a while ago, as you all know, Twitter added that lightning bolt that you click on by accident sometimes.

739
00:41:30,482 --> 00:41:32,259
Rym: And it has a bunch of ads and nonsense in there.

740
00:41:33,401 --> 00:41:38,540
Rym: And Twitter has been hinting for a while that they're going to get rid of the chronological timeline.

741
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,140
Scott: Haven't we talked about this before?

742
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:44,460
Rym: I think I've bitched about it, but we've never really talked about this a hundred times.

743
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,959
Scott: I don't really understand why it has to be a main bit.

744
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:46,565
Rym: I don't think.

745
00:41:46,585 --> 00:41:47,299
Rym: Do you have a better one?

746
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,271
Scott: No, but all right.

747
00:41:48,292 --> 00:41:48,638
Rym: There we go.

748
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,571
Rym: There we go.

749
00:41:49,591 --> 00:41:49,836
Rym: Put up.

750
00:41:50,601 --> 00:41:52,520
Scott: I still feel like it's a rerun bleh.

751
00:41:52,821 --> 00:41:55,018
Rym: If you hand me something better, I will gladly take it.

752
00:41:55,742 --> 00:41:56,533
Scott: I can just go home.

753
00:41:56,573 --> 00:41:57,060
Scott: That'd be better.

754
00:41:57,321 --> 00:42:02,259
Rym: So this issue is interesting for one reason to me.

755
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:19,660
Rym: And that reason is it's coming out of a fundamental problem that I think a lot of tech companies or at least companies that use technology in a very like social media open format are going to run into increasingly where the investors or the people with stock want their money back.

756
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,044
Scott: Well, this is why.

757
00:42:21,124 --> 00:42:23,520
Scott: So, you know, I hate Silicon Valley bullshit, right?

758
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,879
Scott: But it seems to be the way to make a company these days.

759
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:30,560
Scott: You know, the way to make a company in the 90s was you made a company and then you IPO to get money.

760
00:42:31,261 --> 00:42:34,580
Scott: And if you have your money comes from an IPO, they expect you to be profitable.

761
00:42:34,661 --> 00:42:35,086
Scott: And you know what?

762
00:42:35,106 --> 00:42:35,976
Scott: Those companies weren't.

763
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:38,979
Scott: So when they went under, it caused a big old crash.

764
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:39,461
Rym: Yeah.

765
00:42:39,982 --> 00:42:45,460
Scott: Nowadays, the way to do things is, oh, we'll just instead of IPO, we'll get VCs to fund us.

766
00:42:45,981 --> 00:42:49,720
Scott: And then the VCs like buying lottery tickets and they know it and they don't give a shit for whatever reason.

767
00:42:50,221 --> 00:42:51,780
Scott: But you don't have to make any fucking money.

768
00:42:52,141 --> 00:42:58,740
Scott: The VCs just want you to become like big and popular so that you have a better chance of like getting bought so that their investment pays out.

769
00:42:59,022 --> 00:43:00,800
Scott: And then if whoever bought you, well, fuck them.

770
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:01,468
Scott: I don't care.

771
00:43:01,489 --> 00:43:02,200
Scott: Right.

772
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:05,200
Scott: And now it doesn't ruin like the whole market because you're not even on the market.

773
00:43:05,821 --> 00:43:08,980
Scott: But companies like Twitter, they eventually IPO or something.

774
00:43:09,702 --> 00:43:12,300
Scott: And then, oh, we actually have to make money now.

775
00:43:12,641 --> 00:43:18,460
Scott: We actually need a real business like none of these tech companies are real businesses that make any money or do anything valuable.

776
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:23,038
Rym: Qualify that by the fact that Twitter makes one and a half billion dollars a year.

777
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,018
Rym: And apparently that's not enough.

778
00:43:25,582 --> 00:43:27,560
Scott: It must cost a lot to have all those computers.

779
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:30,549
Rym: Yeah, because all those employees ask you everywhere.

780
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:37,340
Scott: Also, it's just that even when you become a public company, they expect your profits to keep increasing.

781
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:43,420
Scott: So even if you do manage to profit, you know, from some mechanism, they expect you to go more and more and more and more.

782
00:43:44,066 --> 00:43:44,309
Scott: Right.

783
00:43:44,632 --> 00:43:45,360
Scott: Like look at GoPro.

784
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:51,980
Scott: GoPro went public and the stock went because it's like, whoa, this is clearly a really popular fucking thing, right?

785
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:53,859
Scott: Everyone's buying these GoPro cameras everywhere.

786
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:54,841
Rym: Counterpoint.

787
00:43:54,962 --> 00:44:01,820
Scott: And again, while I am up and GoPro still profits, they sell plenty of cameras, but they're not doing any better than they used to.

788
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:02,988
Scott: So the stock went down.

789
00:44:03,069 --> 00:44:04,480
Rym: So a lot of people make the mistake.

790
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,880
Rym: And again, I am not giving investment advice.

791
00:44:07,722 --> 00:44:09,460
Rym: Just got to make that clear on GeekNights.

792
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,839
Scott: You will never hear legal or investment advice.

793
00:44:12,402 --> 00:44:13,084
Rym: Ever, ever.

794
00:44:13,585 --> 00:44:18,220
Scott: But unless a lawyer or investment professional comes on and says otherwise, but you won't hear it from us.

795
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:26,860
Rym: When a company like GoPro that's been around and you think, wow, that company is really doing well when they IPO whatever price the stock is.

796
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,520
Rym: When it IPOs, it takes that into account.

797
00:44:30,182 --> 00:44:33,040
Rym: It's got to do better than that from that GoPro.

798
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:37,940
Scott: I think IPO at something like 20 or 30 or something went up to like 90 at one point.

799
00:44:38,021 --> 00:44:39,922
Scott: And now it's like 15.

800
00:44:39,922 --> 00:44:42,520
Rym: And I never bought GoPro stock because I'm not stupid.

801
00:44:43,242 --> 00:44:46,699
Rym: I would have I would have invested in GoPro if I could have in the early days.

802
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,104
Rym: Chipotle, right?

803
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:52,820
Rym: Chipotle was like, do you see they closed all the stores for like a norovirus meeting?

804
00:44:53,181 --> 00:44:54,205
Scott: Yeah, whatever.

805
00:44:54,406 --> 00:44:56,595
Scott: It's like, you know, it went up like crazy big.

806
00:44:58,301 --> 00:45:08,840
Scott: And then now that it's like, oh, well, not only is the whole market down in general, but, you know, you know, no one's coming to our stores because we poisoned our customers.

807
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:13,980
Rym: So, again, I'm not a lawyer and I'm not giving any advice or I'm not making any predictions or anything.

808
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:22,000
Rym: But the reason Chipotle is down isn't really because of the norovirus thing, nor is it because of the food poisoning thing.

809
00:45:22,401 --> 00:45:29,360
Rym: It's probably because Chipotle's growth is unsustainable due to the fact that minimum wage and things like that.

810
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,102
Rym: All right.

811
00:45:30,142 --> 00:45:31,948
Scott: But that's the point I was told started.

812
00:45:31,968 --> 00:45:35,700
Scott: this whole tangent of these other companies is that Chipotle makes money.

813
00:45:36,363 --> 00:45:37,660
Scott: They're very profitable.

814
00:45:37,721 --> 00:45:39,859
Scott: They're just not making more profits than they used to.

815
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:46,680
Scott: So even if Twitter profits, even if they make one and a half billion, if they're on the IPO, which is the big mistakes.

816
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:50,440
Scott: And now once you IPO, you're expected to keep making more profit all the time.

817
00:45:50,802 --> 00:45:53,820
Scott: And if you make less profit or the same profit, that's not good.

818
00:45:54,141 --> 00:46:00,360
Scott: So you constantly, even if you have a successful, sustainable product like Twitter, they have to find a way to make more money.

819
00:46:00,521 --> 00:46:05,360
Scott: So they're going to fuck with it and they're going to keep fucking with it as long as they're a public company forever.

820
00:46:05,581 --> 00:46:09,860
Scott: They're going to say because they have to do if you don't do anything, you obviously can't increase profits.

821
00:46:10,103 --> 00:46:11,520
Scott: You have to fuck with something.

822
00:46:11,681 --> 00:46:12,878
Rym: Now, there is another way to go.

823
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:17,040
Rym: Like some companies just pay dividends out of the stock and then people are happy with that.

824
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,707
Rym: I got some stocks, but you have to keep.

825
00:46:18,747 --> 00:46:21,680
Scott: you can't even if you have to keep making money.

826
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:22,461
Rym: You don't have to make money.

827
00:46:22,501 --> 00:46:24,485
Scott: You have to keep doing something.

828
00:46:24,646 --> 00:46:30,898
Scott: you have to keep making money, like even if GoPro was giving up big dividends and kept having solid sales.

829
00:46:32,223 --> 00:46:35,360
Scott: They still have to make a GoPro five, a GoPro six, a GoPro seven.

830
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:36,619
Scott: You know, they had to keep doing something.

831
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:40,000
Rym: Well, they have to keep selling things or doing something that generates money.

832
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:40,523
Scott: They can't.

833
00:46:40,543 --> 00:46:41,999
Scott: But they can't just stay still and do that.

834
00:46:42,161 --> 00:46:43,740
Scott: Sell the one camera for all eternity.

835
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:44,523
Rym: Well, maybe you could.

836
00:46:44,543 --> 00:46:47,380
Rym: Depends how good that camera was to be some fucking amazing camera.

837
00:46:47,521 --> 00:46:48,248
Scott: Yeah, of course.

838
00:46:48,289 --> 00:46:49,400
Rym: Even then, it'd be too amazing.

839
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:49,801
Scott: Yes.

840
00:46:49,841 --> 00:46:52,899
Scott: You can firmware flash this camera and it gets more megapixels.

841
00:46:54,281 --> 00:46:58,220
Rym: Yeah, it turns out the iPhone one is the same as the iPhone seven.

842
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:02,160
Rym: You just it's just and it was all just padding inside of that.

843
00:47:03,622 --> 00:47:12,060
Rym: But the problem with Twitter specifically is that I don't think anyone ever had any idea how they were going to make money off of it ever.

844
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:23,780
Scott: Well, Twitter was one of those accident companies like Flickr where they were originally making something else and they made Twitter by accident off a side project and then it became more successful than the thing they were actually doing.

845
00:47:24,546 --> 00:47:26,480
Rym: I mean, I didn't even adopt Twitter super early.

846
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:28,119
Rym: I adopted it relatively early, though.

847
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:29,340
Scott: Yeah, relatively.

848
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:33,000
Scott: But you know, when I was in Costa Rica, pretty much like a few weeks where it's like Twitter.

849
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:34,360
Scott: Oh, that's some fad thing.

850
00:47:34,441 --> 00:47:36,500
Scott: And then a few weeks later, it's like, oh, things still around.

851
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:40,980
Rym: I. Yeah, but now they need to make money.

852
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:49,840
Rym: And I feel like no one in the company actually, at least the people who make the decisions, like the business people, I don't think any of them use Twitter.

853
00:47:50,321 --> 00:47:53,579
Rym: I don't think any of them like have any idea what Twitter actually is.

854
00:47:53,961 --> 00:47:54,202
Scott: No.

855
00:47:54,766 --> 00:47:57,020
Scott: And remember, Twitter's different things to different people.

856
00:47:57,141 --> 00:47:58,040
Scott: That's part of the problem.

857
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:13,360
Rym: Yeah, but I feel like what they want Twitter to be is a push feed of ads and celebrity nonsense at subscribers who consume it and they make money off of the people paying to push that feed.

858
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:13,640
Rym: Right.

859
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:20,860
Scott: Well, when you have a company, right, you know, you usually what you want to do when you have a company and make more money is listen to your customers.

860
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:23,480
Scott: And customers are the people who give you money.

861
00:48:24,081 --> 00:48:24,302
Scott: Right.

862
00:48:24,723 --> 00:48:29,220
Scott: So if you're Twitter, the people who are tweeting and reading tweets are not your customers.

863
00:48:29,681 --> 00:48:31,520
Scott: The customers are the people who are giving you money.

864
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:32,840
Rym: So who's giving you money right now?

865
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:39,340
Scott: People are buying your data and people are buying ads or the people who gave you money a long time ago when Twitter makes decisions.

866
00:48:39,941 --> 00:48:40,222
Scott: Right.

867
00:48:40,563 --> 00:48:45,100
Scott: They are really changing Twitter to serve the interests of those people.

868
00:48:45,601 --> 00:48:58,640
Scott: And the only thing they care about in terms of the people use Twitter, the users who are not the customers, is will we change something to make so many of them leave that it will actually make the customers upset?

869
00:48:59,622 --> 00:48:59,883
Scott: Right.

870
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:03,316
Scott: So it's like they don't actually give a shit if they piss off the users and they like.

871
00:49:03,376 --> 00:49:04,400
Scott: they redesign Twitter.

872
00:49:04,781 --> 00:49:09,200
Scott: And there was a rabble and now the rabble is gone and everyone still uses Twitter.

873
00:49:09,361 --> 00:49:11,120
Rym: Well, because they didn't actually do it at the time.

874
00:49:11,181 --> 00:49:12,760
Scott: You can go listen to GeekNights from then.

875
00:49:12,821 --> 00:49:13,958
Scott: We definitely talked about this.

876
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:16,780
Scott: People are just complaining because they hate change.

877
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,499
Scott: But this isn't really a change.

878
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,920
Scott: Just like bullshit, you know, whatever.

879
00:49:21,021 --> 00:49:22,379
Scott: I think it actually looks better now.

880
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:22,822
Scott: Yeah.

881
00:49:22,944 --> 00:49:23,660
Scott: No one cares.

882
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:31,540
Rym: But what they're talking about today, like the recent thing, like it's fundamentally different from when like, oh, Facebook moved a button and now you're all freaking out.

883
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:31,941
Rym: Right.

884
00:49:32,042 --> 00:49:35,000
Rym: This is more like Facebook became Myspace.

885
00:49:35,961 --> 00:49:42,500
Rym: Like they literally changed what it is that it's like if you change in the skin of a game versus changing the mechanics of the game.

886
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:59,340
Rym: And well, the other kind of side problem is that with a lot of products, like, for example, TV or especially advertising, the customers actually want like their target demographic, like the people they want to target that they're paying to target.

887
00:49:59,861 --> 00:50:04,620
Rym: They actually kind of want dumb people, like they kind of want people who aren't that discerning.

888
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,164
Rym: And the like there is.

889
00:50:07,284 --> 00:50:15,300
Rym: so there's a situation where you'll have a person who uses your service, but the customers don't care about that person like me personally.

890
00:50:15,864 --> 00:50:17,080
Rym: I don't see Twitter ads.

891
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,359
Rym: I don't interact with Twitter ads.

892
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:19,518
Rym: Ads don't work on me.

893
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:22,140
Rym: So I'm just costing Twitter money.

894
00:50:22,581 --> 00:50:28,780
Scott: Like every time I look at you're getting a free service, you're basically getting this communication platform and you're not paying anything for it.

895
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:32,500
Rym: Every time I search Twitter, I'm just costing them a little tiny bit of money.

896
00:50:33,746 --> 00:50:34,920
Scott: You have to execute a search.

897
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:40,020
Scott: Their network bandwidth has to send you some data, you know, and you don't pay them jack shit.

898
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:40,500
Rym: Yeah.

899
00:50:40,722 --> 00:50:43,940
Rym: Now you might say, oh, but you're providing them content that will make more people use Twitter.

900
00:50:44,161 --> 00:50:47,740
Rym: Yeah, I'm providing content for one thousand one hundred and twenty seven people.

901
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:53,940
Rym: Twitter doesn't give a shit about the people who use Twitter because I'm on here entertaining them a thousand people.

902
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:55,900
Rym: That's less than the number of people in the panel room.

903
00:50:56,821 --> 00:51:04,120
Scott: If Rym quit Twitter, their profits would go up by the amount of resources that Rym uses a number of people a lot because he's like a Twitter addict.

904
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:09,640
Scott: So you'd be like a number of people might even add up to like a dollar or two a year in terms of just electricity.

905
00:51:09,861 --> 00:51:16,860
Rym: If I quit using Twitter, a number of people greater than zero, but statistically less than one would quit using Twitter.

906
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,019
Rym: So I don't matter at all.

907
00:51:21,582 --> 00:51:26,620
Rym: But I feel like my use case of Twitter is the only actually interesting thing Twitter does.

908
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:28,224
Scott: Yes, you're the only.

909
00:51:28,244 --> 00:51:31,460
Scott: no one else using the same thing in a different way has any validity.

910
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:33,020
Scott: Only the way I use it is valid.

911
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:36,431
Rym: Yeah, I mean, obviously that's a real way you use Twitter.

912
00:51:36,451 --> 00:51:38,619
Scott: that is different from the way I use it is not OK.

913
00:51:39,121 --> 00:51:40,239
Scott: Only the way I use it is good.

914
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,459
Rym: I guess my question for you is, what do you use Twitter for?

915
00:51:42,902 --> 00:51:44,059
Scott: I use it for the same thing you use it for.

916
00:51:45,942 --> 00:51:48,780
Rym: So is there any way to make money off of you on Twitter?

917
00:51:49,621 --> 00:51:49,769
Scott: Yes.

918
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:51,341
Rym: All right.

919
00:51:51,381 --> 00:51:55,980
Rym: How would you if you were Twitter and you want to make money off of Scott's, how would you do it?

920
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:56,839
Scott: Charge me for Twitter.

921
00:51:57,161 --> 00:52:00,200
Rym: Yeah, I'd pay for Twitter because then I'd be the customer.

922
00:52:00,902 --> 00:52:01,083
Rym: Yeah.

923
00:52:01,184 --> 00:52:01,507
Rym: You know what?

924
00:52:01,527 --> 00:52:02,799
Rym: If I'm the customer, it'll do whatever.

925
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:09,000
Rym: I mean, we both use Twitter because it's a public chat room of all of our friends.

926
00:52:09,862 --> 00:52:12,540
Rym: And it's also a public chat room where there's another public.

927
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:16,080
Rym: There's a bunch of other public chat rooms nearby and I can kind of listen to all of them.

928
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:19,520
Rym: So like there's people that don't know me, but I know who they are.

929
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:20,182
Scott: Twitter isn't perfect.

930
00:52:20,223 --> 00:52:24,380
Scott: It could be better, but it's just all the people that I want to be are on there.

931
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:28,099
Scott: So and it'd be hard to get all the people that I want to move to something else.

932
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:33,160
Scott: So even though Twitter, I could probably make a better Twitter on my own.

933
00:52:34,021 --> 00:52:38,418
Scott: A, I couldn't handle that many users without spending a lot of money or without using ass.

934
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:40,288
Scott: Right.

935
00:52:40,469 --> 00:52:41,780
Scott: Even then, I still have to pay for the ass.

936
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:42,760
Rym: Yeah, you'd have to pay for the ass.

937
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,139
Scott: Ass is more expensive than, you know, make your own ass.

938
00:52:45,401 --> 00:52:47,027
Scott: Depends.

939
00:52:47,047 --> 00:52:50,580
Scott: And all those people I want to be on there wouldn't come over and abandon Twitter for it.

940
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:59,540
Scott: So that's really the value of Twitter is, you know, for me is I want to be chatting with those people that I follow and the people that follow me who want to hear from me.

941
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,379
Scott: I want them to hear from me when I have something to say.

942
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:01,721
Rym: Yep.

943
00:53:01,801 --> 00:53:08,992
Rym: But I feel like Twitter, I mean, the ways they've tried to monetize are analyzing and or selling their data, which sure.

944
00:53:09,033 --> 00:53:09,275
Rym: Sure.

945
00:53:09,316 --> 00:53:09,720
Scott: Go ahead.

946
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:10,325
Scott: Whatever you can.

947
00:53:10,772 --> 00:53:11,360
Rym: I don't really care.

948
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,660
Scott: I mean, that's how you want to collect data about my YouTube video.

949
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:15,270
Scott: I retweeted.

950
00:53:15,291 --> 00:53:15,639
Scott: Go nuts.

951
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:15,960
Rym: Yep.

952
00:53:16,041 --> 00:53:21,340
Rym: I mean, I pay for YouTube with the data that they get from my videos and the people who pay for red.

953
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:23,880
Scott: I pay for YouTube directly with YouTube Red.

954
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:24,763
Rym: Yeah, I don't.

955
00:53:25,024 --> 00:53:29,500
Rym: So anytime you like, if you watch our panel video even once, I get a tiny amount of money.

956
00:53:30,364 --> 00:53:31,479
Scott: Well, how long do you have to watch it for?

957
00:53:31,761 --> 00:53:32,566
Rym: I have no idea.

958
00:53:32,586 --> 00:53:34,960
Scott: I watched it for one second to make sure it works.

959
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:36,399
Rym: So I actually was looking at the stats.

960
00:53:36,681 --> 00:53:45,620
Rym: The money that the GeekNights' Rym YouTube channel gets is about 50/50 between people who see ads and people who pay for YouTube Red and watch the videos.

961
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:49,920
Scott: I'd be really curious how many total people out of all YouTube users pay for red and how many.

962
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:55,080
Rym: But also last month I got about 12 bucks from people who pay for YouTube Red.

963
00:53:55,220 --> 00:54:03,800
Scott: I think the YouTube Red numbers are way lower than the non YouTube Red numbers, but I want to see the YouTube Red hours per person average.

964
00:54:04,041 --> 00:54:07,400
Rym: Oh, I think the YouTube Red people watch a fuck ton of YouTube.

965
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:08,520
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

966
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:13,060
Scott: I want to also see like YouTube Red total hours versus non YouTube Red total hours.

967
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:14,301
Scott: Right.

968
00:54:14,322 --> 00:54:15,800
Scott: There'll be some interesting information there.

969
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:16,275
Scott: I want to know.

970
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:16,680
Rym: Yeah.

971
00:54:16,721 --> 00:54:17,323
Rym: YouTube Red is.

972
00:54:17,524 --> 00:54:21,040
Rym: YouTube Red is like the perfect example of how to monetize something effective.

973
00:54:21,361 --> 00:54:21,463
Scott: Yeah.

974
00:54:21,484 --> 00:54:22,100
Scott: Give me Twitter blue.

975
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,979
Scott: I'll pay for it as long as I get awesome stuff like no ads.

976
00:54:25,561 --> 00:54:26,059
Rym: And you know what?

977
00:54:26,948 --> 00:54:27,398
Rym: I pay what?

978
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,640
Rym: Twelve bucks a year for Flickr.

979
00:54:30,222 --> 00:54:32,500
Rym: I'd pay twelve bucks a year for Twitter.

980
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:33,220
Scott: I pay twenty four.

981
00:54:33,321 --> 00:54:35,340
Scott: I used Twitter made them way more than Flickr.

982
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:39,680
Rym: Yeah, I might even pay them like a small amount per month, like a couple bucks a month.

983
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:40,000
Scott: Yeah.

984
00:54:40,061 --> 00:54:46,820
Scott: Now, the thing is, we we talked about this because someone, you know, a while ago when I found this quote from some advertising guy or whatever.

985
00:54:47,321 --> 00:54:55,660
Scott: But if we when you pay to make ads go away, you're identifying yourself as person with money, which makes advertisers want to pay more to see you.

986
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:56,521
Scott: Yeah.

987
00:54:56,782 --> 00:55:02,060
Scott: So then if we pay for Twitter with no ads, someone's going to offer that they're going to turn around and be like, right.

988
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:08,020
Scott: Like, oh, my God, if we could show an ad only to the people who pay for Twitter blue, I would pay you like a zillion dollars.

989
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,204
Scott: And Twitter be like, oh, OK.

990
00:55:09,566 --> 00:55:12,840
Scott: And then it's like, I'll pay even more money to make them not see this ad.

991
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:13,381
Scott: Right.

992
00:55:13,421 --> 00:55:19,900
Rym: And it's like, OK, because and even though, you know, a lot some of you work in advertising and you occasionally disagree with me on Twitter and one, fuck you.

993
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:29,940
Rym: But to the fundamental idea of advertising is that you are paying to force other people to watch something they don't want to see if they want to see it.

994
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:31,033
Rym: You're not advertising.

995
00:55:31,053 --> 00:55:31,540
Rym: It's research.

996
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:44,580
Scott: You're paying it to basically like steal someone's a part of someone's life, you know, infest what one or more of their five senses with, you know, sensory inputs that you want to put there that they don't want to put there.

997
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:50,740
Rym: Because if I want to find out what movies are coming, I might go to a movie and see the trailers because I chose to walk into that room and watch them.

998
00:55:51,102 --> 00:55:54,100
Rym: Or I might ignore the trailers and like come into after the trailers start.

999
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:58,080
Scott: It's like you are paying to force me to hear something I don't want to hear, see something I don't want to see.

1000
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:59,660
Scott: It's like torture that you bought.

1001
00:55:59,961 --> 00:56:05,500
Scott: Yeah, you like someone has a torture device and you rented it from them and chose the the means of torture.

1002
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:11,040
Rym: It's also very telling that 90 percent of the torture that is inflicted upon me is car ads.

1003
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,338
Rym: Guess who's never going to fucking buy a car?

1004
00:56:14,521 --> 00:56:18,160
Scott: Actually, if I do buy a car and I'd like a Ferrari or some shit and they don't advertise.

1005
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:22,280
Rym: Yeah, or I'm going to either that or I'm going to buy the cheapest possible car because I don't care.

1006
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:22,961
Scott: Or I'll be.

1007
00:56:23,082 --> 00:56:29,400
Scott: I'm only going to buy a car from so rich that I can afford like the car and a garage to put it actually and whatnot.

1008
00:56:29,541 --> 00:56:31,679
Rym: Funnily enough, I am thinking about buying a car.

1009
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:33,280
Scott: Can you afford a garage?

1010
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:36,299
Rym: So because Zipcar got so expensive, I was actually looking into this.

1011
00:56:36,821 --> 00:56:44,299
Rym: And if you and I split a lease on a car and paid for parking, there is a parking spot available at my building to 150 a month.

1012
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:51,540
Rym: So if we if we if we if we are parking for less than 200 a month, it'd be 150 a month at my apartment and a perpetual lease.

1013
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:53,200
Rym: We just like get a new car every couple of years.

1014
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:58,840
Rym: You pay like 200 a month for the lease, which those is 350 a month plus taxes divided by twos.

1015
00:56:58,880 --> 00:56:59,711
Scott: Like 200 a month.

1016
00:56:59,751 --> 00:57:00,399
Scott: I'm not paying that.

1017
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:05,117
Rym: So 200 a month would be cheaper than for 200 a month.

1018
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:10,980
Scott: I could upgrade my Internet speed to like a zillion megabits and get cable TV that I wouldn't watch.

1019
00:57:11,241 --> 00:57:14,760
Rym: It would be cheaper than all the combined rental cars.

1020
00:57:15,281 --> 00:57:19,840
Rym: And when we take buses or Amtrak to places that we could more easily drive to combine per year.

1021
00:57:20,241 --> 00:57:23,799
Scott: I'm not paying twenty four hundred dollars a year for something I'm hardly going to use.

1022
00:57:24,182 --> 00:57:25,379
Rym: Yeah, you're not going to go to Wildwood.

1023
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:33,380
Rym: But not paying $200 a month to go to Wildwood once a year, because I'm going to because if I rent a car to go to Wildwood, I'm charging you for that shit now.

1024
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:34,223
Scott: Sure.

1025
00:57:34,264 --> 00:57:34,445
Scott: Right.

1026
00:57:34,626 --> 00:57:35,351
Scott: So you rent the car.

1027
00:57:35,492 --> 00:57:36,700
Scott: even if the rent a car costs.

1028
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:37,487
Scott: What is it costing?

1029
00:57:37,527 --> 00:57:38,418
Scott: Twenty one hundred dollars.

1030
00:57:38,941 --> 00:57:39,324
Rym: It'll cost.

1031
00:57:39,344 --> 00:57:41,560
Rym: it'll cost like three hundred bucks to get it for the weekend.

1032
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:41,962
Rym: Great.

1033
00:57:42,062 --> 00:57:42,565
Scott: That's fine.

1034
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:44,920
Scott: That's three hundred bucks a year, not twenty four hundred a year.

1035
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:46,340
Scott: And I got the same amount of transportation.

1036
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:47,740
Rym: What if we go to Wildwood twice?

1037
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:48,741
Scott: Fine.

1038
00:57:48,802 --> 00:57:49,264
Scott: Six hundred.

1039
00:57:49,284 --> 00:57:52,040
Scott: We had to go to Wildwood four times for it to be.

1040
00:57:52,222 --> 00:57:53,260
Rym: Or we go to Wildwood twice.

1041
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:59,340
Rym: We go we use that car to go to like go to a party and then Albany party and suddenly it's breakeven.

1042
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:02,640
Scott: It had to be like at least once a month.

1043
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:03,720
Rym: So, Scott, here's the magic.

1044
00:58:04,121 --> 00:58:08,620
Scott: If we get one, then you're not counting the cost of the gas and the maintenance and the pain in the ass parts and shoveling.

1045
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,480
Rym: If you rent cars, you got to pay for that shit anyway.

1046
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:11,265
Scott: Shoveling the snow.

1047
00:58:11,306 --> 00:58:12,639
Scott: You don't shovel snow for rent a car.

1048
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:13,946
Rym: No, you don't.

1049
00:58:14,046 --> 00:58:16,880
Rym: I could probably use TaskRabbit and pay for someone to come and do it.

1050
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:17,486
Rym: Got to pick.

1051
00:58:17,527 --> 00:58:18,460
Scott: how much does that cost?

1052
00:58:18,762 --> 00:58:19,559
Rym: Like five bucks.

1053
00:58:20,381 --> 00:58:22,028
Rym: Actually, I looked at that because there was someone.

1054
00:58:22,048 --> 00:58:24,680
Rym: you could for five bucks, they would come and get all the snow off your car.

1055
00:58:25,902 --> 00:58:28,040
Rym: They wouldn't shovel it, but they get all the snow off.

1056
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:31,500
Scott: I need you to dig my car out completely as if it was a rent a car.

1057
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:33,179
Rym: I think that'd be like fifteen or twenty bucks.

1058
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:34,899
Scott: Yeah, well, now I might as well get the rent a car.

1059
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:39,560
Rym: So there's going to be indoor parking for one hundred and twenty five right there when that building finishes.

1060
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:40,930
Scott: One what?

1061
00:58:41,011 --> 00:58:41,580
Scott: One twenty five.

1062
00:58:41,761 --> 00:58:43,480
Scott: Well, mine is outdoor parking for one fifty.

1063
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:45,380
Rym: Yeah, because it's gonna be a whole parking garage in there.

1064
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:47,499
Rym: But you got to live in one of these buildings to get access to it.

1065
00:58:48,082 --> 00:58:48,583
Scott: Oh, I do.

1066
00:58:48,744 --> 00:58:53,260
Scott: Oh, you can live in this building and by parking in this is all one complex, even that building that's right there.

1067
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,179
Rym: The all the yellow buildings are one big complex.

1068
00:58:55,624 --> 00:58:55,907
Rym: Oh, OK.

1069
00:58:56,069 --> 00:58:56,940
Rym: But Scott, here's the magic.

1070
00:58:57,060 --> 00:59:05,200
Rym: If we get one more person in on this car, OK, if we divide it one more way, like Chase, then it's like one twenty five a month.

1071
00:59:05,361 --> 00:59:05,685
Rym: Yeah.

1072
00:59:05,726 --> 00:59:06,819
Rym: Then suddenly it gets good.

1073
00:59:07,121 --> 00:59:10,340
Scott: I would pay one hundred a month if I could have a car, maybe one hundred.

1074
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:12,960
Scott: That's like a borderline anyway.

1075
00:59:13,182 --> 00:59:15,197
Scott: But yeah, that's Twitter much.

1076
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:21,691
Rym: But so Twitter started selling ads and I started just flagging every ad I see.

1077
00:59:21,731 --> 00:59:26,300
Rym: if I use the main because I don't use any of the people keep telling me, oh, use this weird Twitter client.

1078
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:30,000
Scott: I use TweetDeck in Chrome on the PC, which has no ads.

1079
00:59:30,141 --> 00:59:33,480
Scott: But when I'm on the iPhone, I use the regular Twitter client, which has ads.

1080
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:33,942
Scott: Yeah.

1081
00:59:34,323 --> 00:59:38,440
Rym: And I use TweetDeck because I'm like setting up all my scheduled tweets and like all my nonsense.

1082
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:41,699
Rym: But I just go to the Twitter website at work.

1083
00:59:41,821 --> 00:59:43,419
Rym: Like I'm not going to use TweetDeck at work.

1084
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,240
Rym: No, I just use the Twitter website because it's fine.

1085
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:53,300
Rym: I actually see so few ads because every time I do see an ad, I flag it as offensive and Twitter won't show it to me again.

1086
00:59:54,260 --> 01:00:02,180
Rym: So what I found is if you keep flagging every ad you see is offensive, eventually you start seeing like the weird ads.

1087
01:00:02,682 --> 01:00:05,480
Rym: I started seeing a bunch of ads for like cults like Scientology.

1088
01:00:06,443 --> 01:00:08,339
Rym: I started seeing like Mormon ads.

1089
01:00:08,981 --> 01:00:15,759
Rym: I started seeing like a lot of weird like like not like homeopathy, but Mormons bought ads and the playbills for Book of Mormon.

1090
01:00:17,365 --> 01:00:17,891
Scott: I like that.

1091
01:00:18,315 --> 01:00:18,699
Rym: You know what?

1092
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:21,540
Rym: Plus one to Mormons for having a sense of humor.

1093
01:00:21,881 --> 01:00:25,600
Rym: That's actually also probably not the worst idea compared to other cults.

1094
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:27,040
Scott: The Mormons, they kill you with niceness.

1095
01:00:27,181 --> 01:00:29,659
Rym: Yeah, I'll take the Mormons over Scientology any day.

1096
01:00:30,941 --> 01:00:36,340
Rym: But then I started seeing ads for like furry, like cosplay nonsense.

1097
01:00:36,582 --> 01:00:38,680
Scott: Stop retweeting furry cosplay nonsense.

1098
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:39,181
Rym: No.

1099
01:00:39,221 --> 01:00:41,060
Rym: So a bunch of other people were talking about this.

1100
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:42,879
Rym: You see this and also anime.

1101
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:45,960
Scott: I've been seeing some Twitter ads related to the things I tweeted.

1102
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:54,320
Rym: I saw the most ads for specifically cosplay lenses to stick in your eyes.

1103
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:55,380
Rym: I haven't seen any of those.

1104
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:56,660
Rym: I saw nothing but ads.

1105
01:00:56,780 --> 01:00:58,240
Scott: How many cosplay people are you following?

1106
01:00:58,420 --> 01:00:59,419
Scott: Because I'm following one.

1107
01:01:00,310 --> 01:01:00,620
Rym: Uh, one.

1108
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,280
Rym: Probably the same person you're following.

1109
01:01:02,961 --> 01:01:08,439
Rym: So when I started playing those as offensive, I never saw any cosplay or furry nonsense again ever.

1110
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:21,860
Rym: As soon as I flagged one like lens in your eyes, like fake contact lens to make your eyes look like something as if you make a little thing that automatically like keeps flagging Twitter ads as offensive all the time until eventually all the ads are offensive.

1111
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:24,580
Rym: So actually I haven't seen any Twitter ads for a couple of months now.

1112
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:25,396
Rym: So I think I did it.

1113
01:01:25,641 --> 01:01:25,747
Rym: Whoa.

1114
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:26,900
Rym: I think I flagged everything.

1115
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:29,180
Scott: Maybe you got to show me how to flag as offensive.

1116
01:01:29,321 --> 01:01:34,439
Rym: If you, if you just go to the website and you see it easy on the website, just click on the, how do you do it in the app?

1117
01:01:34,886 --> 01:01:35,400
Rym: Uh, I don't know.

1118
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:36,500
Rym: I don't see him in the app anymore.

1119
01:01:36,788 --> 01:01:37,059
Rym: All right.

1120
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:38,239
Rym: So I only do it on the website.

1121
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:41,340
Rym: I just click on the X and it's like tweet was offensive.

1122
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:42,740
Rym: Tweet appeared too often.

1123
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:43,900
Rym: Tweet was irrelevant.

1124
01:01:45,261 --> 01:01:51,200
Scott: The problem I've had sometimes is I was, I did do a thing for a while where I'd block the account of whoever bought the ad.

1125
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:52,520
Rym: I did that for a long time.

1126
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:53,799
Scott: The problem is, is that.

1127
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:58,120
Scott: Then you get in a situation where you might've actually wanted to see something they tweeted.

1128
01:01:58,220 --> 01:02:06,519
Scott: For example, uh, maybe McDonald's tweeted in, you know, made a tweet and then promoted that tweet, but you know, and then you got in your timeline and I don't want to see that shit.

1129
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:08,680
Scott: So you want to, if you block the McDonald's account.

1130
01:02:09,002 --> 01:02:09,640
Scott: Okay, sure.

1131
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:10,620
Scott: You're not going to see that ad anymore.

1132
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:10,940
Scott: Great.

1133
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:15,640
Scott: But then your friend retweets a funny picture of grimace and some fry guys.

1134
01:02:16,024 --> 01:02:17,199
Scott: And now you can't see that shit.

1135
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:19,740
Scott: Cause you blocked all of McDonald's, even though that wasn't an ad.

1136
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:21,140
Rym: Pay attention advertisers.

1137
01:02:21,521 --> 01:02:22,558
Rym: See the difference between the two.

1138
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:26,859
Scott: I mean, it was an ad because it was from McDonald's, but I chose to see it.

1139
01:02:27,321 --> 01:02:31,420
Scott: You know, I wanted to see funny grimace because I didn't follow the McDonald's account.

1140
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:36,520
Rym: I followed my friend who my trust and my friend showed me that thing.

1141
01:02:36,782 --> 01:02:39,959
Rym: If my friend retweeted everything McDonald's did, I would stop following them.

1142
01:02:40,083 --> 01:02:40,255
Rym: Yeah.

1143
01:02:40,463 --> 01:02:41,380
Rym: That's why Twitter works.

1144
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:47,459
Scott: You follow the people you care about and maybe McDonald's tweets on like the 25th anniversary of my kids.

1145
01:02:47,821 --> 01:02:50,940
Scott: It's probably the 30th anniversary, but you know what I'm saying?

1146
01:02:51,241 --> 01:02:55,099
Rym: But the problem with the Twitter ads is that as far as I can gather, they did not make money.

1147
01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:55,878
Scott: No.

1148
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:59,280
Rym: So Twitter seems to want to make money.

1149
01:02:59,361 --> 01:03:01,640
Scott: You were buying ads, you know, because you're evil.

1150
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:02,820
Scott: Would you buy ads on Twitter?

1151
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:08,800
Rym: No, probably I would, because you can probably get them real cheap right now.

1152
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:10,179
Rym: I probably would buy ads on Twitter.

1153
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,100
Rym: Probably buy a shit ton of ads on Twitter.

1154
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:13,400
Scott: It's going to be a waste of money.

1155
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:20,820
Rym: You could have spent that money on something useful, but I'd be buying ads to get people who are too stupid to block ads, maybe that's the whole point.

1156
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:21,979
Rym: I'm going after those people.

1157
01:03:22,461 --> 01:03:30,640
Rym: If I want to go after people like me, I would do press releases about my product and hope that the product was something that Rym cares about.

1158
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:37,220
Scott: I see so many companies being successful without any marketing whatsoever, uh, that I feel like it's, you know, there's no reason to buy ads.

1159
01:03:37,341 --> 01:03:43,220
Scott: If you can just, just put your effort into your product, they might have marketing, they don't have advertisements, right?

1160
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:47,540
Rym: There's a, there's advertisements are at one tool in the marketers toolkit.

1161
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:53,740
Rym: But so now I feel like what Twitter is trying to do with this change that may or may not be coming.

1162
01:03:53,900 --> 01:04:09,838
Rym: I mean, it was leaked that it's happening is instead of having a guaranteed feed and remember Facebook used to have a guaranteed feed too, where if I follow Daryl Surratt, I'm guaranteed to see everything he tweets in my timeline when he tweeted it.

1163
01:04:10,521 --> 01:04:16,698
Rym: And if I tweet something, I know that every single one of my followers, all thousand of them, except for the ones that muted you.

1164
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:16,945
Rym: Yeah.

1165
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:18,519
Rym: Which there's a few, I assume.

1166
01:04:19,581 --> 01:04:20,758
Rym: Uh, did you mute me?

1167
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:21,959
Rym: Is that what's going on here?

1168
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:25,992
Rym: But they, they at least could see it if they wanted to.

1169
01:04:26,574 --> 01:04:34,379
Rym: Facebook shed all over that idea, and now if you say something, it's kind of random whether or not everyone who follows you sees it.

1170
01:04:34,945 --> 01:04:35,739
Rym: They may or may not.

1171
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:38,140
Rym: If you want to guarantee you, they see it, you got to pay.

1172
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:46,399
Rym: And I feel like that's the model Twitter wants because they feel like Facebook makes money with it and they can't come up with anything better than that.

1173
01:04:47,561 --> 01:04:56,200
Rym: Because the new system is basically instead of a, just a timeline of everything, everyone, you know, tweeted an algorithm that decides what you might like based on what's relevant.

1174
01:04:56,602 --> 01:05:00,358
Rym: And they're really trying to brand Twitter to be that moments tab that no one clicks on.

1175
01:05:01,223 --> 01:05:03,000
Rym: Like who is the person who clicks on moments?

1176
01:05:03,444 --> 01:05:04,439
Rym: Like I'm going to click on it right now.

1177
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:04,916
Rym: What's in here.

1178
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:07,439
Scott: They must have data for who clicks on it, but it's not me.

1179
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:08,058
Rym: You know what it is?

1180
01:05:08,681 --> 01:05:10,780
Rym: It's just a shitty newsfeed here.

1181
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:14,320
Rym: Leonardo DiCaprio and Lady Gaga, something, something at a lunch.

1182
01:05:14,605 --> 01:05:14,919
Rym: Really?

1183
01:05:15,321 --> 01:05:16,620
Rym: That's, that's like the top thing here.

1184
01:05:16,702 --> 01:05:17,258
Rym: Oh, and a riot.

1185
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:22,660
Scott: And shouldn't this be, I mean, shouldn't this be using the things that Twitter knows about you to show you things that you want to see.

1186
01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:25,380
Rym: Tell me about Kanye and Yeezy or something.

1187
01:05:26,660 --> 01:05:38,891
Scott: Uh, figuring out what ads to say, figured out enough about Ram that they knew that they should show him cosplay related ads and furry related ads, but they couldn't figure up enough about Ram that he doesn't know that to know that he doesn't know Yeezy is.

1188
01:05:39,153 --> 01:05:44,438
Rym: nor do I give a shit about Leonardo DiCaprio and Lady Gaga schmoozing at a luncheon 19 minutes ago.

1189
01:05:49,403 --> 01:05:50,950
Rym: So that literally ruined sweater.

1190
01:05:51,191 --> 01:06:06,958
Rym: if it turns into this and it ruins it in subtle ways, because if you're, if the, the stuff I see is what Twitter's algorithm thinks will make them money, that is literally opposite of what I actually want to see, which right now is my friend Kat Small complaining about jet lag.

1191
01:06:07,581 --> 01:06:09,598
Rym: Uh, Joshua AC Newman, starting a Patreon.

1192
01:06:09,901 --> 01:06:12,979
Scott: Shouldn't you be doing what you always do and tell people, there's no such thing as jet lag.

1193
01:06:14,284 --> 01:06:16,220
Rym: Uh, well, no, there's not no such thing as jet lag.

1194
01:06:16,302 --> 01:06:17,119
Rym: I'm just immune to it.

1195
01:06:17,803 --> 01:06:20,199
Rym: I am a hundred percent am.

1196
01:06:21,723 --> 01:06:23,480
Rym: Uh, Andrew complaining about Deadpool.

1197
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:25,717
Rym: Someone making a joke about druids.

1198
01:06:26,944 --> 01:06:27,917
Rym: This picture of pretzel.

1199
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:36,560
Scott: We should send him into space and then wait for it to be like, you know, new in his time and then have him land where it's midnight in the, after like 10 days in space.

1200
01:06:36,882 --> 01:06:39,000
Rym: Scott, I've done that many times.

1201
01:06:39,220 --> 01:06:43,018
Rym: I've flown to like Hong Kong and lived there a week and then flown right back to New York.

1202
01:06:44,041 --> 01:06:46,220
Rym: Emily has seen me land and be totally fine.

1203
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:49,120
Rym: And then let's go out to dinner and he's secretly sleeping on the inside.

1204
01:06:51,701 --> 01:06:57,699
Rym: I'll get tired sometimes because I was on a plane for 25 hours, but no, that's not what jet lag is.

1205
01:06:58,545 --> 01:06:59,560
Scott: Oh, that's not what jet lag is.

1206
01:06:59,660 --> 01:07:00,400
Scott: Then I don't have it either.

1207
01:07:00,461 --> 01:07:01,760
Scott: Cause I, all I do is get tired.

1208
01:07:02,221 --> 01:07:04,640
Scott: Sometimes it's what do you, what is, what is jet lag?

1209
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:13,606
Rym: So do you do like if your time zones, like if it's, if it's night where you are now, but it's morning where you left from, do you wake up at 3 a.m.

1210
01:07:13,647 --> 01:07:14,559
Rym: and can't go back to sleep?

1211
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:14,987
Scott: No.

1212
01:07:15,540 --> 01:07:16,679
Rym: Then that, yeah, that's jet lag.

1213
01:07:16,980 --> 01:07:22,650
Rym: Do you get hungry at the wrong time, but then not be hungry when you should be able to eat and feel nauseous when you try to eat.

1214
01:07:22,952 --> 01:07:30,643
Scott: the timing might be that I don't get nauseous, no, but the timing of hungry and this might be a little off that first day, like when we got to Australia, I think it was like a weird time and that

1215
01:07:30,704 --> 01:07:32,231
Rym: is actually a symptom of jet lag

1216
01:07:32,613 --> 01:07:36,533
Scott: and, but then it's like, you know, by the second meal, it's I'm a nun that

1217
01:07:36,654 --> 01:07:39,380
Rym: I might actually experience that except I'm always hungry anyway.

1218
01:07:39,583 --> 01:07:40,520
Rym: So I'm always hungry.

1219
01:07:40,761 --> 01:07:41,839
Scott: So I'm way hungry right now.

1220
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:42,540
Scott: I'm actually fading.

1221
01:07:42,844 --> 01:07:44,200
Rym: I am so fucking hungry.

1222
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:45,759
Scott: Like I don't have any energies right now.

1223
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:53,780
Rym: So yeah, in some Twitter might try to monetize their platform by literally making it a shitty version of Facebook.

1224
01:07:54,000 --> 01:08:02,899
Scott: If anyone wants to help me make the replacement Twitter or is making the replacement Twitter and needs me on their team, I have the perfect design for it and I know how to code it.

1225
01:08:03,742 --> 01:08:05,119
Scott: I just don't want to put all that effort in.

1226
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:06,400
Scott: So lend me your keyboard.

1227
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:07,359
Rym: Lend us your ass.

1228
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:08,380
Scott: Lend us your keyboard.

1229
01:08:08,740 --> 01:08:09,399
