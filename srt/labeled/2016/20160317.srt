00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,599
Rym: It's Thursday, March 17th, 2016.

2
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:12,581
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,862 --> 00:00:15,710
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:16,592 --> 00:00:20,168
Rym: preparation Let's do this.

5
00:00:24,951 --> 00:00:29,490
Rym: So my company like changed all its insurance II stuff and I finally sorted all that out.

6
00:00:29,711 --> 00:00:32,849
Rym: So, you know like new insurance and my insurance now is actually way better.

7
00:00:33,452 --> 00:00:35,321
Rym: So I started doing all that dance of.

8
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:37,090
Rym: I don't really have a good PCP's.

9
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,856
Rym: I was looking for a new like main doctor to be my doctor and I Was.

10
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:43,890
Scott: you find one not yet actually.

11
00:00:43,911 --> 00:00:44,812
Rym: Yeah It's not easy.

12
00:00:44,873 --> 00:00:47,422
Rym: every good doctor that my insurance takes.

13
00:00:47,523 --> 00:00:48,105
Rym: that I've looked.

14
00:00:48,185 --> 00:00:50,293
Rym: I went to Zoc Docs and I was like Who are the best?

15
00:00:50,353 --> 00:00:52,801
Rym: like 40 doctors in Manhattan?

16
00:00:53,603 --> 00:00:55,770
Rym: And as I go down the list, none of them are taking patients.

17
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,115
Rym: They're all like now we don't.

18
00:00:57,336 --> 00:00:58,822
Rym: we don't need anyone like.

19
00:00:59,203 --> 00:01:08,968
Scott: I had an awesome doctor who moved away I think I've said this in the show a long time ago and then so I eventually last year I went to a doctor that was at the same office, but was good obviously and he was okay.

20
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:19,748
Scott: It wasn't like a bad doctor, you know, it was definitely a sciency doctor and not a woo doctor, which is good But it wasn't someone who like really, you know took time to chill out like the other guy did.

21
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:29,719
Scott: the other guy like wanted me to come back for like a second appointment and Spent a lot of time like discussing everything and didn't care like what level of This guy was just sort of like.

22
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,088
Scott: he seemed like he was in a hurry and was just sort of like.

23
00:01:32,269 --> 00:01:34,117
Scott: yep All right, there's nothing wrong with you.

24
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:37,089
Scott: And I know that you haven't been to a doctor and like, you know, it's like.

25
00:01:37,149 --> 00:01:38,749
Scott: listen I know there's nothing wrong with me.

26
00:01:39,151 --> 00:01:44,433
Scott: I haven't been to a doctor in like a zillion years, but I'm in my 30s and I just want to make sure Just oldening.

27
00:01:44,513 --> 00:01:49,470
Scott: so I'd like you to like at least make it appear that you're spending a little bit of time examining my situation.

28
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,262
Rym: So yeah, so my last primary care practitioner I visited once.

29
00:01:53,724 --> 00:02:02,662
Rym: every time I get a primary care practitioner I get it because there's a reason I need to go to the doctor and I don't have a doctor and every time I go I'm fine.

30
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:03,331
Rym: like.

31
00:02:03,351 --> 00:02:06,200
Rym: the thing is never a problem and the doctors always met.

32
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:11,922
Rym: so I never go back to them and then usually my insurance changes or Something and then I don't start all over.

33
00:02:11,942 --> 00:02:13,490
Scott: why couldn't that awesome doctor just stay?

34
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,950
Scott: Why do you have to go take a much better position in Florida?

35
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:16,632
Scott: I've decided.

36
00:02:16,672 --> 00:02:20,004
Rym: my metric now is do they have modern stuff in their office?

37
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,209
Scott: That's always my measuring.

38
00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:24,920
Scott: everyone I mean every baby real really any business.

39
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:27,388
Scott: I'm measuring by how modern the shit is in their office.

40
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:30,257
Rym: Yep I'm gonna be really real.

41
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:37,910
Rym: here is are the people the Socio-economic class of people in the waiting room within a couple of bounds of me?

42
00:02:38,211 --> 00:02:40,121
Rym: Are they way above or below me?

43
00:02:40,141 --> 00:02:43,096
Rym: because if they're way above me I probably like.

44
00:02:43,116 --> 00:02:46,470
Rym: I probably can't actually afford that doctor like my insurance really won't cover it that well.

45
00:02:46,894 --> 00:02:53,770
Rym: And if it's way below me It's probably not the best place to be for obvious reasons because American healthcare is kind of terrible.

46
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,398
Scott: How do you know that it's not Iron Monkey?

47
00:02:55,419 --> 00:03:04,730
Scott: if with all those I am confident I would not I would bet Iron Monkey was serving the rich people and also the low-class people and he was the best doctor.

48
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:05,152
Scott: You know what.

49
00:03:05,172 --> 00:03:09,370
Rym: if Iron Monkey came out and was the doctor I would continue to go to that doc.

50
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,990
Scott: But no one knew that it was Iron Monkey.

51
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,399
Scott: They thought he was doctor whatever his name was.

52
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:17,655
Rym: they didn't know it was a secret like spider-man unless they ever saw him and his Wife clean up the house.

53
00:03:18,237 --> 00:03:23,519
Rym: They closed the doors before they clean the house, but I Actually, I don't need to go to a doctor.

54
00:03:23,559 --> 00:03:25,028
Rym: So I'm still looking for a doctor.

55
00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:27,141
Rym: either No one will take me or the people that will take me.

56
00:03:27,161 --> 00:03:29,933
Scott: if anyone knows a good doctor in Manhattan I mean all the other thing.

57
00:03:30,314 --> 00:03:40,428
Rym: all the doctors that are flagged as definitely taking patients are the ones who are paying to run ads In things like Zoc Doc, so I didn't check Zoc Doc.

58
00:03:40,488 --> 00:03:42,295
Scott: I checked I checked.

59
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:49,862
Scott: I know it's like a cool way better than the insurance sites my insurance site But it's not great, but that's right now because I switched to Aetna.

60
00:03:50,042 --> 00:03:52,430
Scott: I have United something so I used to have United.

61
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:53,594
Rym: They're the second worst.

62
00:03:53,976 --> 00:03:55,441
Scott: Yeah, they have an app now that I use.

63
00:03:55,461 --> 00:03:56,304
Scott: Yeah works.

64
00:03:56,686 --> 00:03:57,710
Rym: Oxford was worse than them.

65
00:03:57,871 --> 00:03:58,742
Scott: I never had that though.

66
00:03:58,762 --> 00:03:59,269
Rym: They're not good.

67
00:03:59,771 --> 00:04:01,416
Rym: I kind of miss the while.

68
00:04:01,517 --> 00:04:03,803
Rym: Obamacare is definitely a positive thing 100%.

69
00:04:03,803 --> 00:04:04,546
Rym: if you disagree you're wrong.

70
00:04:07,352 --> 00:04:10,110
Rym: Because I was young and healthy and because insurance sucked so bad.

71
00:04:10,632 --> 00:04:18,127
Rym: It was kind of cool back when I had my weird FSA HSA combo health insurance Like that was actually the best insurance I ever had.

72
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:23,190
Rym: But anyway, I had to go to the dentist and I had to go urgently because I was fine.

73
00:04:23,271 --> 00:04:24,158
Rym: I was a little overdue.

74
00:04:24,179 --> 00:04:25,853
Scott: you could have gone to the awesome dentist I found.

75
00:04:25,873 --> 00:04:27,768
Scott: Dennis seems to be easier to find than doc.

76
00:04:27,829 --> 00:04:28,752
Rym: yeah They do so.

77
00:04:28,812 --> 00:04:33,145
Rym: I was overdue getting a cleaning like it been a little over a year.

78
00:04:33,165 --> 00:04:34,830
Scott: That's a problem.

79
00:04:35,171 --> 00:04:39,007
Rym: Well the thing is actually if your teeth are in good health you only have to go every year.

80
00:04:39,027 --> 00:04:42,090
Scott: right sure But you know what the insurance pays for me to go every six months.

81
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,215
Scott: so why the fuck not?

82
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:49,555
Rym: but I had switched dentists a bunch of times and My teeth were fine Like I have zero tooth complaints.

83
00:04:49,936 --> 00:04:57,350
Rym: and then suddenly a few days ago my jaw started hurting real bad Like way in the back here and saw that skiing.

84
00:04:57,571 --> 00:05:01,966
Rym: So, of course, I got Google and I'm like jaw pain and of course, it's like T.

85
00:05:02,247 --> 00:05:04,413
Scott: Okay Jock ends.

86
00:05:04,473 --> 00:05:07,264
Rym: It's like jaw cancer and I'm like, well, I'm just gonna assume that's not true.

87
00:05:07,806 --> 00:05:12,441
Rym: And then it's like Dental abscess and I'm like, is it possible that I have one of the?

88
00:05:12,461 --> 00:05:16,869
Rym: because a lot of tooth problems are painless Until they're bad.

89
00:05:17,311 --> 00:05:22,289
Rym: A lot of people don't realize that like cavities if they start to hurt they're already really bad.

90
00:05:22,309 --> 00:05:24,030
Scott: that yeah It's like root canal territory.

91
00:05:24,442 --> 00:05:28,442
Rym: Yeah Like that like dental stuff will basically not hurt and you'll feel fine.

92
00:05:28,482 --> 00:05:30,930
Scott: and those teeth are bones most or they're not.

93
00:05:31,091 --> 00:05:34,324
Scott: You know unless it gets down to the nerve you don't feel right?

94
00:05:34,485 --> 00:05:35,730
Rym: Yeah, there's a lot of stuff going on there.

95
00:05:35,851 --> 00:05:39,629
Rym: So I'm like, is it possible that I have like a hidden dental abscess?

96
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:46,979
Rym: So I'm like fucking around in my mouth with a flashlight and there's nothing like I can find not even a Swelling nothing.

97
00:05:46,999 --> 00:05:53,686
Rym: There's nothing pus coming out of your mouth Nope, and of course, I made the fucking mistake of looking online for pictures of what a dental abscess.

98
00:05:53,866 --> 00:05:54,870
Scott: No, don't do that.

99
00:05:57,073 --> 00:05:59,676
Scott: Also fun fact Your mouth didn't look.

100
00:05:59,878 --> 00:06:01,445
Scott: if your mouth didn't make you want to vomit.

101
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:02,290
Scott: You're probably okay.

102
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:13,130
Rym: Yeah, also in general googling for dental stuff What I found was that because I was worried like, you know My gums aren't a hundred percent grade and I got a few dental problems cuz I'm in my 30s and I had braces a kid.

103
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:27,330
Rym: But yeah looking online tells me that I take better care of my teeth and almost every American by far You're basically looking at only at the horror pictures and then assuming everyone's like no So I was looking at dental sites that are like do you have gingivitis?

104
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:30,384
Rym: This is what gingivitis looks like and I'm like, whoa, holy shit.

105
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:31,509
Rym: My teeth are way better than that.

106
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:34,917
Rym: But so I don't have anything.

107
00:06:34,957 --> 00:06:37,065
Rym: so I'm wondering like what the hell could it be?

108
00:06:37,186 --> 00:06:42,212
Rym: and I read up all the stuff on like TMJ mandibular issues and Mandibles.

109
00:06:42,432 --> 00:06:54,140
Rym: Yeah, cuz it's in the mandible area and all the websites pretty much said it's cancer It's a hidden abscess It's like cellulitis or like bone inflection.

110
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,845
Scott: It's a random pain for being an old person.

111
00:06:56,046 --> 00:06:56,307
Rym: Actually.

112
00:06:56,367 --> 00:06:57,290
Rym: No, nothing said that.

113
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:00,807
Rym: Well, that's they all said you go to a doctor immediately.

114
00:07:00,867 --> 00:07:01,410
Rym: Holy shit.

115
00:07:01,591 --> 00:07:02,052
Scott: Yeah, sure.

116
00:07:02,293 --> 00:07:09,765
Rym: So I try to find a dentist and I find I looked up and according to a bunch of websites I found what might be the best dentist in New York.

117
00:07:09,785 --> 00:07:10,730
Scott: My dentist is real good.

118
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,236
Scott: I don't know how much better it could be.

119
00:07:12,256 --> 00:07:15,629
Scott: who takes my insurance unless they're like giving blowjobs in the waiting room.

120
00:07:15,649 --> 00:07:19,402
Rym: I mean But so I went in and they get.

121
00:07:19,462 --> 00:07:20,890
Rym: I was like so I need an appointment now.

122
00:07:21,092 --> 00:07:28,442
Rym: Usually I was like so I expected for a new patient It'd be like a week or two and they were like you want to come in right now And I was like, what do you mean right now?

123
00:07:28,462 --> 00:07:29,670
Rym: They're like, can you get here in the next hour?

124
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:34,783
Rym: And I was like actually no and they're like pick your time and I showed up on time.

125
00:07:35,325 --> 00:07:41,390
Rym: They took me in on time Zero delay, they did the thing like immediately all modern technology.

126
00:07:43,153 --> 00:07:47,454
Rym: So long story short my teeth are fine and the dentist was like, I don't know on your jaw There's nothing wrong with it.

127
00:07:47,855 --> 00:07:49,942
Rym: So maybe it's just oldening.

128
00:07:50,223 --> 00:07:51,247
Rym: come back to me if it still hurts.

129
00:07:51,287 --> 00:07:54,906
Rym: in like a month Even did an x-ray and he's like, yeah, there's nothing back there.

130
00:07:54,926 --> 00:08:04,217
Rym: So But if you go to a new dentist and they do an x-ray and they use film Don't go to that dentist anymore.

131
00:08:04,257 --> 00:08:04,478
Rym: They can.

132
00:08:04,518 --> 00:08:05,564
Rym: why would you what?

133
00:08:05,604 --> 00:08:06,790
Scott: Dennis still uses film?

134
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,161
Rym: Most dentists in New York.

135
00:08:08,343 --> 00:08:09,070
Scott: What the fuck?

136
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:15,850
Rym: I haven't seen a dentist with film and like my previous dentist used film for the x-rays But they didn't use the big old like plate film.

137
00:08:16,171 --> 00:08:20,430
Rym: They use the like they put the film on the thing in your mouth and then they put the gun up to your mouth.

138
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:23,970
Scott: Yeah, I've even even so the thing with film right and I know this cuz my uncle's dentist.

139
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:29,032
Scott: Yeah, and he told me this when he got his like because I went to him right when I was like a long time in My life.

140
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:38,029
Scott: he got like digital like x-rays like a long time ago And he's like look when you use the film x-ray machine and you turn the x-ray machine on you got to turn it on like.

141
00:08:39,511 --> 00:08:41,138
Scott: But if you use the digital one, it's like.

142
00:08:41,298 --> 00:08:43,886
Scott: it's like it's like the exposure time.

143
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:59,492
Scott: due to this you know the ISO of the you know, I guess sensor the x-ray sensor versus you know, the The the eyes the x-ray ISO of the x-ray film right is way But Drastic, right?

144
00:08:59,513 --> 00:09:02,883
Scott: So you have a lot less x-rays hitting your teeth and your face.

145
00:09:02,903 --> 00:09:04,388
Rym: Yeah, which is a good thing.

146
00:09:04,408 --> 00:09:08,510
Rym: Yeah But most dentists have a lot of old busted crap.

147
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:19,330
Rym: So the fact that they had modern x-ray machines and actually the machine was way tiny like way tinier than I expected And I did the dentist I go to the machines actually in the closet like you can't even it's like yeah.

148
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:25,710
Rym: They had a modern like ultrasonic cleaning instead of the old cleaning methods and everything was just great.

149
00:09:25,992 --> 00:09:28,144
Rym: And then at the end he was you know, he was asking me about.

150
00:09:28,205 --> 00:09:30,469
Rym: he was like, yeah your teeth are fine You take great care of him.

151
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:36,456
Rym: He's like you flossed at least once a day and I was like actually I flossed twice a day and he was like I don't really much.

152
00:09:36,557 --> 00:09:36,939
Rym: He's like.

153
00:09:37,099 --> 00:09:37,903
Rym: actually he was like.

154
00:09:37,943 --> 00:09:43,327
Rym: that's actually what I recommend and No one has ever said that they did it twice a day where I've believed them.

155
00:09:43,669 --> 00:09:52,041
Rym: Yeah Yeah He was basically telling me how Generally, the more someone talks about how often they floss the more likely it is They're lying at that is true.

156
00:09:52,142 --> 00:09:58,229
Scott: and he's like I can tell See your teeth it's like I clean my bathroom five times a day go.

157
00:10:01,531 --> 00:10:05,770
Rym: It's like I floss every day and he's like I looked at your gums and they started bleeding.

158
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:16,457
Rym: But Yeah, so I got a new dentist and while I'm there he was looking up because I have two teeth that were kind of like Chipped like the top of the tooth where it goes into.

159
00:10:16,477 --> 00:10:19,327
Rym: the gum was like cracked off like old old injuries.

160
00:10:19,347 --> 00:10:20,190
Scott: Whoa, it's fine.

161
00:10:21,071 --> 00:10:23,041
Rym: That's just something that happens and like.

162
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,870
Rym: the only danger with that is that there's.

163
00:10:25,912 --> 00:10:28,701
Rym: no, actually the danger is there's less distance before.

164
00:10:29,102 --> 00:10:33,968
Rym: if you got a cavity there it get all the way in and Brushing your teeth does a braid your teeth away a little bit.

165
00:10:34,371 --> 00:10:37,730
Rym: So theoretically you'll braid through the tooth and eventually have problems.

166
00:10:38,232 --> 00:10:44,179
Rym: So he was like you want me to just bond him and I was like, I guess I can make an appointment Like no, let's do it right now like 10 minutes.

167
00:10:44,219 --> 00:10:45,626
Scott: What is what is bonding?

168
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:46,450
Scott: do bonding?

169
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,433
Rym: It's just a what it's it's.

170
00:10:47,453 --> 00:10:48,215
Rym: so it's a filling.

171
00:10:48,276 --> 00:10:54,542
Rym: but instead of drilling and going in they just put filling stuff on the outside to Cover up like there's a busted bit.

172
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:57,678
Scott: No And that usually called a sealant.

173
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,505
Rym: Uh sealants a little bit different.

174
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:06,290
Rym: That was a. this is a bond Mm-hmm, and I was like really right now and he was like, yeah, and I haven't gotten a bondings in like he's looking.

175
00:11:06,391 --> 00:11:07,783
Scott: He's just looking to get some money's right.

176
00:11:07,843 --> 00:11:10,137
Scott: the more he procedures He does the more the insurance got to pay.

177
00:11:10,318 --> 00:11:14,519
Rym: so he charged me like actually a really low rate for the bonding and he did A really good job in the bonding like it worked.

178
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,002
Rym: Great.

179
00:11:15,405 --> 00:11:16,210
Scott: He's not gonna do a bad job.

180
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,890
Scott: He wants you to come back so you get more money from you.

181
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:18,420
Scott: not maybe.

182
00:11:18,665 --> 00:11:21,683
Rym: but The final thing is I learned something that I didn't know.

183
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:26,646
Rym: cuz I have that old HSA Like for my old Obama Obamacare stuff, you can still use that money.

184
00:11:27,027 --> 00:11:33,465
Rym: Yeah Back then when I was getting it for free I was saving it one for retirement because that's a loophole.

185
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:37,010
Rym: you can use that shit to retire And you can invest it and there's all this tax stuff.

186
00:11:37,052 --> 00:11:37,488
Rym: It's great.

187
00:11:37,992 --> 00:11:43,650
Rym: But - I was gonna use it if I ever had like a serious medical thing that happened to me like beyond my insurance.

188
00:11:44,551 --> 00:11:45,416
Rym: But I didn't know.

189
00:11:45,456 --> 00:11:47,950
Rym: you could also use it for dental stuff and use it for anything.

190
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,818
Scott: You can use it to just buy town all Dwayne Reed.

191
00:11:49,838 --> 00:11:51,847
Scott: Uh, actually no.

192
00:11:51,948 --> 00:11:54,113
Rym: Yeah That's dodgy.

193
00:11:54,293 --> 00:11:55,517
Scott: use the HSA debit card.

194
00:11:55,578 --> 00:11:56,119
Scott: Wait, just poop.

195
00:11:56,601 --> 00:11:57,564
Rym: That's HSA or FSA.

196
00:11:57,584 --> 00:11:59,753
Scott: Oh FSA.

197
00:11:59,793 --> 00:12:02,350
Scott: yet the FSA we have at our work you can use for that too.

198
00:12:02,651 --> 00:12:07,470
Rym: You can to a degree but FSA has got really clamped down on about two years ago.

199
00:12:07,731 --> 00:12:08,795
Rym: So some stuff has changed.

200
00:12:08,835 --> 00:12:10,000
Scott: Well the FSA at our work.

201
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,510
Scott: They specifically said you can use it for things at Dwayne Reed.

202
00:12:12,751 --> 00:12:13,960
Rym: Have you used it for those things?

203
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:15,330
Scott: I don't put any money in the FSA.

204
00:12:15,631 --> 00:12:19,670
Rym: Oh, you should put like ten bucks in it and get like the one drug you'll ever need.

205
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,463
Scott: I mean, I'm pretty sure I can buy mucinix once a year.

206
00:12:22,483 --> 00:12:23,750
Scott: I don't need that to be tax-free.

207
00:12:24,395 --> 00:12:26,090
Scott: It's a lot of effort to save five bucks.

208
00:12:26,494 --> 00:12:27,970
Rym: So because I have all this HSA money.

209
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:33,810
Rym: You know how people who are rich have those perfect perfect teeth that you get if you basically get rich person teeth their fake teeth.

210
00:12:33,891 --> 00:12:35,430
Rym: Yeah, they're not a hundred percent fake.

211
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:41,729
Rym: I mean, yeah, but I mean but they basically shape your teeth and gums to be a hundred percent on the movie set.

212
00:12:41,849 --> 00:12:42,712
Scott: Perfect Right.

213
00:12:43,274 --> 00:12:45,844
Rym: I basically have enough money in there to get that if I wanted to.

214
00:12:45,864 --> 00:12:50,117
Rym: why would you want that when I'm 50 and my teeth are not great anymore?

215
00:12:50,177 --> 00:12:52,063
Scott: because I'm dentures get some dentures.

216
00:12:52,585 --> 00:12:53,267
Rym: I don't want dentures.

217
00:12:53,287 --> 00:12:54,070
Rym: dentures suck.

218
00:12:54,532 --> 00:12:56,702
Scott: Well dentures are the worst like fake teeth is the greatest.

219
00:12:56,822 --> 00:12:57,807
Scott: You don't to worry about cavities.

220
00:12:57,847 --> 00:12:58,550
Scott: You just chew anything.

221
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,595
Scott: Just get the movie star teeth.

222
00:12:59,615 --> 00:13:00,298
Rym: They're just as good.

223
00:13:00,358 --> 00:13:01,443
Rym: You don't have to take them out at night.

224
00:13:01,463 --> 00:13:05,510
Scott: I Don't want any kind of implant action, you know, sometimes that's necessary.

225
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:09,262
Rym: You only need the implants if you're getting movie star teeth to replace broken teeth.

226
00:13:09,864 --> 00:13:11,470
Scott: Hey, listen, don't play I hot I suck.

227
00:13:14,391 --> 00:13:18,266
Rym: So, yeah, if you can't tell I was just trying to kill a bunch of time because I don't know.

228
00:13:18,387 --> 00:13:20,476
Scott: I don't even have any News, so we have any news.

229
00:13:20,697 --> 00:13:21,400
Scott: So I got some news.

230
00:13:21,481 --> 00:13:22,325
Scott: There's nothing happening.

231
00:13:22,526 --> 00:13:28,005
Rym: It's politics No, but it doesn't involve Trump or any of the stuff that Scott would get super mad about.

232
00:13:28,326 --> 00:13:36,790
Rym: It's the kind of like Political science politics that is at least more relevant to real real world and more long-standing and not so ephemeral.

233
00:13:38,592 --> 00:13:40,601
Rym: So Scott, you know about what's going on with the Supreme Court right now, right?

234
00:13:40,802 --> 00:13:42,529
Scott: Someone died and they got to pick someone new.

235
00:13:43,215 --> 00:13:44,469
Rym: So, do you know what's going on now?

236
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:45,673
Rym: Like why is?

237
00:13:45,733 --> 00:13:46,798
Rym: why would I talk about this?

238
00:13:46,818 --> 00:13:48,406
Rym: because shouldn't it already be taken care of?

239
00:13:48,426 --> 00:13:51,618
Scott: you died a while ago Because I mean it takes as long as it takes.

240
00:13:51,678 --> 00:13:56,824
Scott: right the president can pretty much wait as long as they want to appoint Someone or never appoint someone or appoint a bunch of people.

241
00:13:57,025 --> 00:13:58,050
Scott: you can ever present it.

242
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:00,103
Scott: You can just appoint people whenever the fuck you want.

243
00:14:00,184 --> 00:14:00,607
Rym: FDR did it.

244
00:14:01,231 --> 00:14:09,105
Scott: I was just like I'm gonna point a hundred people right and then Once you appoint someone the Senate has to approve your appointment and they can take however

245
00:14:09,145 --> 00:14:10,228
Rym: the fuck long they want

246
00:14:10,469 --> 00:14:13,745
Scott: and they can Deny or they can say yes, they can say no they can do whatever.

247
00:14:13,825 --> 00:14:14,770
Scott: so that is true.

248
00:14:14,891 --> 00:14:15,756
Scott: It takes as long.

249
00:14:15,857 --> 00:14:19,579
Rym: as however in practice that Basically never happened.

250
00:14:19,599 --> 00:14:23,989
Scott: Yeah, historically the president usually Doesn't appoint a bunch of people if they're not FDR.

251
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:26,962
Scott: They appoint people only when someone dies and Congress might.

252
00:14:27,103 --> 00:14:32,529
Scott: usually when they appoint someone Congress moves that to the top of the to-do list and they vote yes or no.

253
00:14:32,549 --> 00:14:37,237
Rym: now They might vote no and make a few people The vast majority of the time they vote.

254
00:14:37,258 --> 00:14:38,582
Scott: Yes, it's pretty rare that they vote.

255
00:14:38,642 --> 00:14:47,457
Scott: No because usually, you know the president Takes pretty long time and pick someone who's not like way Obviously gonna get node.

256
00:14:47,497 --> 00:14:57,990
Scott: if they want to pick someone who's gonna get a yes because the sooner they get in there You know, they'd rather have someone who's more moderate and acceptable get in and handle some cases and vote the way that they want earlier.

257
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:04,420
Scott: There's a little rather than have the tied court while they're waiting to get like some extreme Person like on the left or right.

258
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,190
Scott: that's not gonna get in anyway, right?

259
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:11,390
Rym: There's a little more nuance to it though because the Supreme Court has such prestige with the American people.

260
00:15:11,992 --> 00:15:14,600
Rym: I mean it has more prestige than any other part of the government.

261
00:15:14,641 --> 00:15:15,082
Rym: Basically.

262
00:15:15,142 --> 00:15:17,490
Scott: It's the least hated part of the government though.

263
00:15:17,691 --> 00:15:20,101
Rym: Actually that is turned around just recently.

264
00:15:20,121 --> 00:15:24,719
Rym: the Supreme Court is as a Surprisingly high on favorability right now.

265
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:27,047
Rym: You want to know why it's not more unfavorable than Congress.

266
00:15:27,087 --> 00:15:30,729
Rym: No, no Congress is less popular.

267
00:15:30,911 --> 00:15:33,470
Scott: I mean like no part of the government is popular, right?

268
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:37,381
Scott: But I'm sure the Supreme Court is more popular than like the DMV, right?

269
00:15:37,602 --> 00:15:43,147
Rym: No, but yeah Congress right now I think is less popular than cat piss man.

270
00:15:43,167 --> 00:15:45,860
Rym: I think Well, that's about Congress.

271
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,789
Rym: Congress is less popular than cat piss man, sure.

272
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:54,630
Rym: So because cap his men's definition is 80% of your friends hate him and more than 80% of Americans hate Congress.

273
00:15:55,810 --> 00:16:02,490
Rym: but so Traditionally they move the process along and they give it the proper level of respect and decorum.

274
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:05,159
Rym: Like if they're not gonna approve someone they just say no.

275
00:16:05,179 --> 00:16:06,463
Rym: Yeah, they'll go through the motions.

276
00:16:06,844 --> 00:16:08,510
Rym: They'll then do the formal vote.

277
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:14,534
Scott: I don't think they even do the for a lot of times like the president just does enough research in advance and consults with them In advance, right.

278
00:16:14,694 --> 00:16:17,345
Scott: and they're like, yeah, that person's gonna get the no don't even send them.

279
00:16:17,405 --> 00:16:18,590
Rym: Oh, that doesn't always work out.

280
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:24,130
Scott: I mean, I remember and I assume you might do some posturing for some other reasons and send someone over.

281
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:25,309
Scott: You know who's gonna get a nose?

282
00:16:26,331 --> 00:16:27,939
Scott: Bill you want through instead.

283
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:30,070
Rym: that actually pretty much never happened either.

284
00:16:30,952 --> 00:16:33,770
Rym: So that the what the notable exception of one of the strange ones.

285
00:16:34,551 --> 00:16:38,150
Rym: This is something that I don't think any of you listeners will remember because you have to be at least as old as us.

286
00:16:38,532 --> 00:16:41,206
Rym: But the whole Robert Bork thing that was like that was the.

287
00:16:41,226 --> 00:16:41,909
Scott: I know that name.

288
00:16:42,532 --> 00:16:43,597
Rym: Did you know anything about Bork?

289
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,210
Scott: He was appointed to the Supreme Court and didn't make it.

290
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:48,276
Rym: Basically, yeah, do you know the whole?

291
00:16:48,316 --> 00:16:48,819
Rym: it's it there's.

292
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,346
Scott: that's the extent of my knowledge.

293
00:16:50,446 --> 00:16:54,627
Rym: That is the earliest political memories I have.

294
00:16:54,647 --> 00:17:00,164
Rym: is Someone talking about Bork and it being referenced by Bloom County?

295
00:17:00,505 --> 00:17:02,070
Rym: and that's how I started learning about politics.

296
00:17:02,452 --> 00:17:04,503
Scott: I know a lot more about Ray Bork the hockey player.

297
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:08,868
Rym: Yeah But do you know why I'm bringing this up now?

298
00:17:09,131 --> 00:17:12,324
Rym: Really like, you know what's going on with Supreme Court if you paid attention at all.

299
00:17:12,545 --> 00:17:13,770
Scott: No, I don't give a fuck really.

300
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,095
Scott: So really shocking.

301
00:17:16,115 --> 00:17:22,986
Rym: No, so this is a big deal because it actually foretells a possible long-term constitutional problem.

302
00:17:23,934 --> 00:17:29,442
Rym: what happened was Scalia died, yeah, and Obama, you know has to nominate someone to replace.

303
00:17:29,502 --> 00:17:30,708
Scott: He doesn't have to but he did.

304
00:17:30,729 --> 00:17:31,512
Rym: well He'd know.

305
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:32,014
Rym: so he don't.

306
00:17:32,034 --> 00:17:33,461
Rym: he only did a little while ago.

307
00:17:33,481 --> 00:17:34,586
Scott: Yeah, but he doesn't have to.

308
00:17:34,606 --> 00:17:40,320
Scott: uh, He has the power to Whenever he wants decorum and precedent says he has to.

309
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,744
Scott: you're saying it was a constitutional issue.

310
00:17:42,005 --> 00:17:42,787
Rym: I'm getting to that.

311
00:17:42,968 --> 00:18:02,227
Rym: Okay, so before anyone said anything Before Obama even said oh my god Scalia's dead The entire Republican Party came out and said we will make sure that no one under any circumstances Gets even talked about no hearings.

312
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:02,850
Rym: Nothing.

313
00:18:02,951 --> 00:18:10,510
Rym: We will refuse to let Obama appoint anyone because He's in the last term of his presidency and the voters should get to pick.

314
00:18:11,311 --> 00:18:14,204
Scott: Well, I mean the reason is stupid, but they can just vote no all they want.

315
00:18:14,224 --> 00:18:14,968
Scott: No, they're not gonna vote.

316
00:18:15,491 --> 00:18:16,540
Rym: No, there's not gonna have a hearing.

317
00:18:16,581 --> 00:18:17,529
Scott: They don't have to do that either.

318
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:19,234
Rym: Yeah, they don't have to.

319
00:18:19,274 --> 00:18:27,680
Rym: technically it's a it is a. it's a glaring fault in the Constitution That has basically never been invoked.

320
00:18:28,082 --> 00:18:34,219
Rym: It's like what it's like a broken rule in a game where Everyone even people are playing to win mutually agreed.

321
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,750
Rym: Let's follow that rule because otherwise the game sucks like it.

322
00:18:38,335 --> 00:18:39,810
Scott: Yeah, I mean the way the Constitution is written.

323
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:44,730
Scott: It says the president has the power to appoint people and the Senate has the power to say yes or no.

324
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:49,370
Scott: So it doesn't say you have to appoint people Doesn't say when it doesn't say under what circumstances.

325
00:18:49,832 --> 00:18:56,908
Rym: But so they can do what they want other than basically like Civil War bullshit Something this has never happened before.

326
00:18:56,928 --> 00:19:00,545
Scott: well I mean nobody had spent more than two terms in office until FDR.

327
00:19:00,585 --> 00:19:01,449
Scott: then they made a rule about it.

328
00:19:01,811 --> 00:19:03,077
Scott: But I'm saying kind of deal.

329
00:19:03,218 --> 00:19:05,368
Rym: know so that the deal is different here because it isn't.

330
00:19:05,388 --> 00:19:08,949
Scott: listen There wasn't a lot of play testing done on the Constitution, right?

331
00:19:10,394 --> 00:19:11,318
Rym: You remember the beta?

332
00:19:11,398 --> 00:19:12,784
Rym: it was the Articles of Confederation.

333
00:19:12,804 --> 00:19:13,970
Scott: No, that was a different game.

334
00:19:14,871 --> 00:19:16,116
Scott: Game wasn't funny alpha.

335
00:19:16,257 --> 00:19:17,000
Scott: Yeah, they played it.

336
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,707
Scott: They said man this quake sucks.

337
00:19:18,747 --> 00:19:19,570
Scott: Let's play counter-strike.

338
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:24,430
Rym: All right, there was no there was the time when they when they forked it There was the south in the north, right?

339
00:19:24,611 --> 00:19:27,210
Rym: The south is just the north plus savory slavery and a bunch of typos.

340
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:30,268
Scott: See we're now at a point where it's like we'd really like to go to like counter-strike.

341
00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:30,510
Scott: go.

342
00:19:30,891 --> 00:19:35,167
Scott: But you know, we got a whole country full of cs1.6 purists and it's never gonna happen.

343
00:19:35,228 --> 00:19:35,790
Rym: But here's the deal.

344
00:19:36,252 --> 00:19:37,557
Scott: No one's gonna play Starcraft 2.

345
00:19:37,557 --> 00:19:45,410
Rym: Starcraft 1 is gonna remain the competitive Eastport When the country was literally about to go to war with itself.

346
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:51,249
Rym: The partisan politics has never gotten to that level with the Supreme Court ever.

347
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:53,353
Rym: Hmm until now.

348
00:19:53,593 --> 00:20:02,839
Rym: and basically the Republican said we won't let Obama appoint anyone because it's in the end of his term and The the interesting because doesn't matter there doesn't matter right?

349
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:05,085
Scott: Why even say because you're just open saying that?

350
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:10,000
Rym: because which is a really stupid because Scott so, you know why there's because you ever heard of the Thurman rule.

351
00:20:11,214 --> 00:20:12,049
Scott: There's a strong third.

352
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:15,404
Rym: It is so the way our Congress actually works.

353
00:20:15,866 --> 00:20:16,670
Rym: and this you know.

354
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:21,464
Rym: These are things that aren't in the Constitution The hidden rules the Congress makes for itself that actually matter a lot.

355
00:20:21,524 --> 00:20:22,850
Rym: those rules matter a lot.

356
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:24,078
Scott: Those are the most important rules.

357
00:20:24,118 --> 00:20:25,265
Scott: Congress just makes its own rules.

358
00:20:25,286 --> 00:20:25,970
Scott: They have rules committee.

359
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,332
Scott: Yeah It makes the rules.

360
00:20:27,412 --> 00:20:29,157
Rym: Congress has a rule about that.

361
00:20:29,217 --> 00:20:30,581
Scott: basically you have to have a reason.

362
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:35,437
Rym: don't appoint anyone in the last and months Of that their term.

363
00:20:35,517 --> 00:20:36,863
Rym: wait for the next person to come in.

364
00:20:36,884 --> 00:20:47,570
Rym: Okay, but Scalia died so early that we would have a date person Supreme Court for well over a year Way beyond the bounds of the Thurman rule.

365
00:20:48,172 --> 00:21:01,990
Rym: It's also interesting that the Republicans who all are spearheading this don't let anyone get in no matter what every one of them Basically last time there was any sort of court stuff were vocal on video on record.

366
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:08,594
Rym: You're adamantly saying that you have to let people appoint even at the end of their terms because that's what the Constitution I mean, this is not.

367
00:21:08,996 --> 00:21:09,598
Scott: I mean what see.

368
00:21:09,718 --> 00:21:10,501
Scott: you're acting like you're.

369
00:21:10,521 --> 00:21:12,308
Scott: so it's like this is Daily Show.

370
00:21:12,389 --> 00:21:15,361
Scott: every day Someone says a thing and then later they say a different thing.

371
00:21:15,421 --> 00:21:17,390
Scott: That's something about their self-serving.

372
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:19,939
Scott: They don't actually care about political reasons for things.

373
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,525
Scott: They care about just their own agenda.

374
00:21:21,746 --> 00:21:22,750
Scott: So this is not news.

375
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:29,890
Scott: Saying this like oh my god, somebody doesn't actually care about political principle.

376
00:21:30,192 --> 00:21:34,639
Scott: They just want to do what they want to do and we'll use any That's in the moment.

377
00:21:34,881 --> 00:21:35,566
Scott: Oh my god.

378
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:36,030
Scott: That's just.

379
00:21:37,811 --> 00:21:38,896
Scott: It's not interesting at all.

380
00:21:39,538 --> 00:21:40,081
Rym: I think it is.

381
00:21:40,141 --> 00:21:44,939
Scott: it's every day that you might as well be saying Oh my god, there's water coming out of this cloud.

382
00:21:45,019 --> 00:21:47,086
Rym: What's going on really happened before?

383
00:21:47,507 --> 00:21:48,270
Scott: who gives a fuck?

384
00:21:48,730 --> 00:22:01,242
Rym: So but the problem is that because they said this now they're worried that the next president will be either Hillary or Trump and They don't want either one of those people to appoint the Supreme Court either.

385
00:22:01,623 --> 00:22:03,129
Scott: Someone's going to appoint you can just vote.

386
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:05,119
Rym: no No, they're never gonna vote again.

387
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,084
Rym: That's what's happening.

388
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:06,506
Rym: Basically.

389
00:22:06,526 --> 00:22:07,250
Scott: You don't have to do that.

390
00:22:07,632 --> 00:22:10,284
Rym: They said they won't let any hearings happen.

391
00:22:10,505 --> 00:22:14,056
Rym: So don't till a Republican is in office effectively.

392
00:22:14,478 --> 00:22:18,170
Scott: So well if you lose the control the Congress then that won't happen.

393
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:19,505
Rym: They're not likely to for 20 or 30 years.

394
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:49,345
Rym: so it is entirely possible unless the Republican Party literally splits in two that we will in the next four to eight to twelve years have a seven person and then possibly a six person Supreme Court and We will literally never appoint someone to the court again unless either we change the Constitution or the rules to force them to have votes or The Congress gets controlled entirely by one party that also has the presidency.

395
00:22:49,365 --> 00:22:49,927
Rym: Mmm.

396
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:50,590
Scott: That's fine.

397
00:22:51,072 --> 00:22:56,070
Rym: That's an entirely new and very destabilizing element of American politics.

398
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:58,922
Rym: Never happened before other than during the Civil War.

399
00:22:58,942 --> 00:23:00,348
Scott: I don't really see the problem.

400
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:04,764
Scott: All right Okay, there's nothing I can do about it and it doesn't matter.

401
00:23:04,804 --> 00:23:06,250
Rym: so you don't find any of this interesting.

402
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,234
Rym: You don't care about school.

403
00:23:07,254 --> 00:23:08,599
Rym: You didn't learn anything about social studies.

404
00:23:08,619 --> 00:23:10,547
Scott: I mean, it's not interesting.

405
00:23:10,567 --> 00:23:11,210
Rym: It's not interesting.

406
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,377
Scott: It's not surprising or new in any way.

407
00:23:13,438 --> 00:23:14,561
Rym: It actually is surprising.

408
00:23:14,622 --> 00:23:17,030
Rym: No one really expected this to happen.

409
00:23:17,131 --> 00:23:18,478
Rym: It's basically never happened.

410
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,630
Scott: Okay, not surprised.

411
00:23:21,352 --> 00:23:24,242
Rym: Okay, probably just cuz you don't know anything about the Supreme Court.

412
00:23:24,462 --> 00:23:25,626
Scott: I know about Congress.

413
00:23:26,168 --> 00:23:26,770
Scott: Do you really?

414
00:23:35,086 --> 00:23:37,666
Rym: Anyway Things of the day.

415
00:23:37,686 --> 00:23:41,520
Scott: my thing of the day is excellent much better than anything you've said so far.

416
00:23:41,761 --> 00:23:46,620
Scott: In fact, if you listen to this episode of GeekNights You can just fast forward to this thing of the day and rather this thing of days.

417
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,598
Rym: So they won't hear your advice until they've already listened to that big mistake.

418
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:53,904
Scott: So and then immediately after this thing of the day is done Rims thing today is probably crappy.

419
00:23:53,925 --> 00:23:56,371
Scott: remember now just stop listening to this episode.

420
00:23:56,411 --> 00:23:59,500
Rym: not everyone can live the purely hedonistic lifestyle that Scott does.

421
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,473
Scott: Hedonistic these drugs I'm taking and these grapes drugs of anything.

422
00:24:04,493 --> 00:24:06,660
Scott: with Edenism all these grapes I mean.

423
00:24:13,341 --> 00:24:19,906
Scott: So if you're in the Russian military or if you're in any military right and you do something bad Usually they punish you right?

424
00:24:19,946 --> 00:24:23,960
Scott: It could be some push-ups or maybe beetle Bailey style peeling some taters.

425
00:24:24,121 --> 00:24:27,697
Rym: I figured they just hang you or like send you to Siberia their militaries where that happens.

426
00:24:27,797 --> 00:24:28,480
Scott: Yeah, right.

427
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:30,720
Scott: It might be like labor might be jail, right?

428
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:35,800
Scott: A lot of punishments are doled out in militaries right even killing pew even if you're by your own military.

429
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:39,654
Scott: But if you're in the Russian military, they have sense of humor.

430
00:24:39,674 --> 00:24:40,738
Scott: I'm red.

431
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:45,752
Scott: So In Russian military right punishment get you.

432
00:24:46,253 --> 00:24:46,534
Rym: that's it.

433
00:24:46,634 --> 00:24:47,577
Rym: punishments always get you.

434
00:24:47,597 --> 00:24:48,821
Rym: that's how punishments work I know.

435
00:24:49,504 --> 00:24:57,538
Scott: so they're very creative as you would imagine if you were to say, I don't know Forget to bring your gun where you're supposed to bring it.

436
00:24:58,402 --> 00:25:02,400
Scott: They punish you by giving you a replacement gun that you have to carry.

437
00:25:02,782 --> 00:25:05,700
Rym: Oh, it's gonna be one of those like the devil ironic punishments.

438
00:25:06,601 --> 00:25:14,015
Scott: It's a punishment that fits the crime and that punishment tends to be Carry a big heavy wooden thing around with you everywhere.

439
00:25:14,076 --> 00:25:15,060
Rym: like those are amazing.

440
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:24,272
Scott: This guy who forgot who was looking at his phone when he was supposed to be military ing and doing something serious Was made to carry around a giant heavy wooden phone everywhere with him.

441
00:25:24,392 --> 00:25:27,200
Rym: I like the guy huffing around the gigantic heavy wooden cigarette.

442
00:25:27,541 --> 00:25:31,892
Scott: Yeah, so check this out and don't join the Russian military.

443
00:25:32,012 --> 00:25:34,257
Scott: and if you do don't miss behave.

444
00:25:34,277 --> 00:25:50,188
Scott: if you join any military of your own free will Or in fact if you're forced into military if you're conscripted at any point in your life into anything Whether you like it or not, I highly suggest following all orders Like if I'm just like, you know,

445
00:25:50,208 --> 00:25:53,864
Rym: oh, yeah, you know, you're in the Nazi German army and you get ordered to do Genocide.

446
00:25:53,884 --> 00:25:54,708
Rym: just follow the orders.

447
00:25:55,009 --> 00:26:00,973
Scott: I'm just saying don't look at your phone If you're on the Navy boat with Horatio, don't do anything.

448
00:26:00,993 --> 00:26:02,258
Scott: That's gonna get you any lashes.

449
00:26:02,278 --> 00:26:02,699
Scott: All right.

450
00:26:04,061 --> 00:26:11,900
Rym: So we we've had several things the day in the past Of like Richard Feynman doing something great because he's just one of the greatest people who have ever lived.

451
00:26:12,141 --> 00:26:14,153
Scott: Yeah problems, but we do a lot about physics.

452
00:26:14,515 --> 00:26:22,133
Rym: Yeah, but All the times we've ever had a Richard Feynman thing on the show It's always been like a thing he did like.

453
00:26:22,233 --> 00:26:23,880
Rym: that is the entertaining thing of the day.

454
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,603
Scott: Well, it's usually.

455
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:27,738
Scott: I mean usually it's a video of him explaining something like the one where he talks about.

456
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:27,960
Scott: like.

457
00:26:28,442 --> 00:26:30,453
Rym: You know, my favorite one is the one where he talks about magnets.

458
00:26:30,493 --> 00:26:31,157
Rym: cuz the guys like.

459
00:26:31,398 --> 00:26:33,420
Scott: so when I pushed I think I saw one where he talked about fire.

460
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,049
Scott: I don't remember the magnet.

461
00:26:35,089 --> 00:26:39,450
Rym: one is good because I remember he was like that, you know Cuz there's always the quote-unquote idiot who's asking the questions.

462
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:45,194
Rym: the guys like so when I push two magnets against each other Like you feel something there like it's repelling and Feynman's like.

463
00:26:45,214 --> 00:26:48,026
Rym: that's really a stupid question Like any and it's just.

464
00:26:48,086 --> 00:26:49,772
Rym: it's one of my favorite videos of him ever.

465
00:26:49,853 --> 00:26:53,198
Rym: but this is not a video of Feynman doing Feynman.

466
00:26:53,882 --> 00:27:03,494
Rym: This is a video talking about Feynman and like actually is sort of a really short biography of why He was the way he was and who he was and I mean you can read.

467
00:27:03,514 --> 00:27:04,458
Scott: there's a comic about this.

468
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:04,880
Scott: you can read.

469
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,959
Rym: Yeah, but if you've enjoyed like the Feynman-y things, I'm sure this biography is available.

470
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:16,245
Rym: This is a very short and succinct 10-minute video Explaining the why of Richard Feynman.

471
00:27:16,285 --> 00:27:17,432
Scott: Not as good as my thing as a.

472
00:27:17,814 --> 00:27:18,920
Rym: I think this is pretty good It.

473
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:23,920
Rym: it goes into great lengths about how many tell you know how he kept getting arrested for pranking people during the Manhattan Project.

474
00:27:24,681 --> 00:27:28,074
Rym: Why wouldn't you all the strip club bongo stuff while he was doing physics.

475
00:27:28,114 --> 00:27:29,379
Scott: I said he wasn't the greatest person.

476
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,394
Rym: It was a different time.

477
00:27:31,414 --> 00:27:41,520
Rym: you understand Basically, what's funny is that the the word best used to describe him in this video is that while he was brilliant He was very annoying.

478
00:27:42,487 --> 00:27:49,760
Rym: You don't say In the meta moment, um, I don't know if I'll peter out on the wheel of time, but I'm pushing into book 12.

479
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,245
Scott: So that like the last book.

480
00:27:51,386 --> 00:27:52,128
Scott: No, there's like 14.

481
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:52,910
Scott: Oh, wow.

482
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:53,713
Scott: You're real close.

483
00:27:53,994 --> 00:27:54,736
Scott: You can just tell me everything.

484
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:55,820
Rym: They're not hard reads.

485
00:27:56,407 --> 00:27:59,264
Scott: No, they're not Anime, Boston's way soon.

486
00:27:59,284 --> 00:28:14,255
Rym: Anime, Boston is not this weekend, but next weekend and we're doing five panels and lectures Friday and Saturday only and probably leave early on Sunday and not actually go to the con Anime, Boston's being weird and they're making us buy badges this show.

487
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,280
Scott: Do I have to actually do that?

488
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,350
Rym: Yeah before the 20th.

489
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,230
Scott: So I have to go to the anime Boston website and buy this.

490
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:23,809
Rym: the first time I have bought a badge To a fan can better get my fucking money back.

491
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:26,720
Scott: Yeah in like when do I get the money back?

492
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:27,363
Rym: I don't know.

493
00:28:27,383 --> 00:28:30,665
Rym: whenever they mail is a check after the con Screw you and you're.

494
00:28:30,926 --> 00:28:33,175
Scott: you know, I'm not giving my money to the charity this time.

495
00:28:33,195 --> 00:28:34,240
Rym: Yeah, I'm taking my money.

496
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,305
Rym: You're taking my money.

497
00:28:35,607 --> 00:28:44,944
Rym: This is literally the first time since like 2002 I've gone to a website for a fan convention and Pre-registered like.

498
00:28:44,964 --> 00:28:45,546
Rym: that's not something.

499
00:28:45,566 --> 00:28:46,388
Scott: what if it's sold out?

500
00:28:46,489 --> 00:28:47,532
Scott: I can't be panelist.

501
00:28:47,813 --> 00:28:49,779
Rym: Well, then I'm gonna email him and be like, hey guys.

502
00:28:52,141 --> 00:29:00,192
Rym: So, yeah if you really want us to be at anime Boston after this year You should probably let anime Boston know cuz we're going.

503
00:29:00,313 --> 00:29:01,840
Rym: you know, we were doing five panels.

504
00:29:02,402 --> 00:29:06,740
Rym: But if they make us buy badges and get reimbursed, we're not going back after this year.

505
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:07,989
Rym: So this be our last anime boss.

506
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:09,260
Scott: Yeah, it's kind of pain in the ass.

507
00:29:09,561 --> 00:29:18,924
Rym: Yeah, all right after anime Boston the next weekend in Lancaster, Pennsylvania a convention that is not making us buy badges Zenkai con.

508
00:29:19,366 --> 00:29:21,114
Scott: I think the chances me going to that are pretty low.

509
00:29:21,214 --> 00:29:22,299
Rym: You're bailing on Zenkai con now.

510
00:29:22,664 --> 00:29:24,202
Scott: I mean, it's a pain in the ass Scott.

511
00:29:24,242 --> 00:29:30,800
Rym: if you go it'll be you me Chris and Anthony sharing a hotel playing board games the entire time.

512
00:29:30,941 --> 00:29:33,938
Scott: Why don't we just not go and play board games in New York for some panels?

513
00:29:35,421 --> 00:29:36,305
Rym: It's like close-up magic.

514
00:29:36,325 --> 00:29:36,626
Rym: is that?

515
00:29:36,646 --> 00:29:37,811
Rym: can we get a lot of fans out of?

516
00:29:38,093 --> 00:29:38,514
Scott: and I got.

517
00:29:38,555 --> 00:29:40,322
Scott: I gotta take a stupid train to Lancaster.

518
00:29:40,342 --> 00:29:41,426
Scott: ruin my whole weekend.

519
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,092
Scott: have a. you know, it's a good weekend.

520
00:29:43,132 --> 00:29:43,614
Scott: I'm losing.

521
00:29:43,674 --> 00:29:46,469
Scott: I can go to the great yet I don't care about the good weather.

522
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,800
Scott: I'm just saying I'm losing the whole weekend.

523
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:48,787
Rym: You can go or not go.

524
00:29:48,888 --> 00:29:50,520
Rym: I can do all those panels on my own pain.

525
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,999
Scott: It's really not worth the effort to go there.

526
00:29:53,401 --> 00:29:56,960
Rym: Will you go next year if we if we do end up bailing on anime Boston forever more?

527
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:03,122
Rym: Is it gonna be in a much easier place to get no Lancaster's easier to get to them Boston the Amtrak's cheaper and you know It goes.

528
00:30:03,364 --> 00:30:05,900
Rym: that lamb track goes directly to the convention.

529
00:30:06,661 --> 00:30:09,672
Rym: It's not like you have to then take a $50 cab or some nonsense.

530
00:30:09,753 --> 00:30:11,640
Scott: It's really not a pleasant trip.

531
00:30:11,901 --> 00:30:15,172
Rym: Also, you can eat Amish food for one day and then there's nothing to eat on Sunday.

532
00:30:15,453 --> 00:30:17,199
Scott: Yeah, that's another good reason not to go there.

533
00:30:18,981 --> 00:30:20,387
Rym: We'll be doing a whole bunch of panels.

534
00:30:20,407 --> 00:30:21,813
Rym: at least I'll be doing a whole bunch of panels.

535
00:30:22,336 --> 00:30:23,340
Rym: and one of the panels.

536
00:30:23,702 --> 00:30:24,586
Scott: Why do you want me to go there?

537
00:30:24,606 --> 00:30:25,932
Scott: So then you don't have to.

538
00:30:25,952 --> 00:30:28,745
Rym: I'm just saying fourth player for board games I don't need to go there.

539
00:30:29,147 --> 00:30:31,015
Rym: Uh, one of the panels about.

540
00:30:31,035 --> 00:30:32,000
Scott: you don't go there.

541
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:32,482
Scott: How about you?

542
00:30:32,502 --> 00:30:36,960
Rym: just don't you want me to bail on a convention that we are listed guests at?

543
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,472
Scott: I think that'll go made a mistake already.

544
00:30:39,653 --> 00:30:40,900
Scott: You already went in plus.

545
00:30:41,622 --> 00:30:43,308
Rym: One of the panels is gonna be rimming Scott.

546
00:30:43,369 --> 00:30:45,958
Rym: even if Scott doesn't go it's gonna be me and Scott Johnson.

547
00:30:45,978 --> 00:30:46,540
Rym: Okay?

548
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,766
Scott: Yeah, go ahead.

549
00:30:47,947 --> 00:30:49,136
Rym: I'll allow you like them apples.

550
00:30:49,377 --> 00:30:56,200
Rym: Okay Shortly after that is PAX East in Boston where we'll be doing Atari game design one of our best recent lectures.

551
00:30:57,301 --> 00:30:58,284
Rym: Also our video.

552
00:30:58,746 --> 00:31:03,060
Rym: one of the many panels we did actually two now from PAX South are on YouTube.

553
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:11,283
Rym: The scary games panel is up and the designing game rules panel is up and the design design game rules panel is one of our better Lectures.

554
00:31:11,404 --> 00:31:13,818
Scott: Why did they let us do that one at PAX East instead of Atari?

555
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:17,191
Rym: Whatever I'm pretty sure it's because the Atari one was a bigger draw.

556
00:31:17,853 --> 00:31:18,475
Scott: I don't know about.

557
00:31:18,515 --> 00:31:19,780
Rym: so they bully at PAX South.

558
00:31:19,881 --> 00:31:22,399
Rym: They both filled the room packs out everything fills the room.

559
00:31:23,363 --> 00:31:28,560
Rym: No, the panel both before and after us that every one of our slots far from filled the room.

560
00:31:29,002 --> 00:31:31,719
Scott: I feel like the panel we went into before us was filling the.

561
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:33,605
Rym: no I wasn't I actually I was.

562
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:38,985
Rym: I was talking to some people a lot of those that our panels filled and not all the panels Filled by far.

563
00:31:39,186 --> 00:31:40,011
Scott: Okay, that's good.

564
00:31:40,092 --> 00:31:40,414
Scott: I guess.

565
00:31:40,575 --> 00:31:43,796
Rym: Yeah, we're Actually kind of tell me how many rooms you filled zinc.

566
00:31:43,857 --> 00:31:46,146
Rym: I can I feel we mostly.

567
00:31:46,186 --> 00:31:51,343
Rym: the only time I didn't fill a room as thank icon was either going at a weird time or one They put me in main events.

568
00:31:52,226 --> 00:31:54,613
Rym: I'm not gonna fill main events at any time.

569
00:31:55,636 --> 00:31:57,020
Rym: I guess derpy Kong's they're made events.

570
00:31:57,102 --> 00:31:57,918
Rym: It's like six people.

571
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,984
Rym: But where was I going with that?

572
00:32:02,044 --> 00:32:10,590
Rym: right so designing game rules filled the room but Atari game design filled the room Way before the panel was gonna.

573
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:11,334
Scott: has I mean it has it.

574
00:32:11,374 --> 00:32:12,440
Scott: they're judging based on that.

575
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,057
Scott: You should judge based on the quality of the panel not based on the.

576
00:32:15,259 --> 00:32:22,259
Rym: you know People go to panels based on one thing The title and what time it's at?

577
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:27,300
Rym: Yeah, it was at four o'clock on a Saturday and it's called like and what else is at the same time as it?

578
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,026
Rym: Yeah, and the panel is called like.

579
00:32:29,287 --> 00:32:32,178
Rym: hey free video cards fucking come here.

Rym: give away what it.

583
00:32:37,174 --> 00:32:38,720
Rym: what if we could do a whole panel?

584
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:41,516
Rym: It's just why you shouldn't give shit away at your panel and then we'll give away like.

585
00:32:41,657 --> 00:32:42,160
Rym: oh my god.

586
00:32:42,361 --> 00:32:43,709

00:33:24,045 --> 00:33:24,748
Scott: We're not see.

605
00:33:24,768 --> 00:33:26,234
Scott: they think we're dispensing video cards.

606
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:40,720
Rym: when a really dispensing Everyone you will find a video card taped to the bottom of your chair And We'll probably be at PAX Prime and then the next PAX out and we're definitely gonna be at PAX Prime.

607
00:33:41,161 --> 00:33:42,927
Rym: I will very likely be at PAX Australia.

608
00:33:43,288 --> 00:33:44,391
Rym: So stay tuned.

609
00:33:44,592 --> 00:33:45,956
Scott: I might go to Europe instead.

610
00:33:46,418 --> 00:33:46,919
Rym: I'll do both.

611
00:33:47,681 --> 00:33:48,606
Rym: I'm going to Hong Kong.

612
00:33:48,807 --> 00:33:49,531
Rym: I was just in Europe.

613
00:33:49,552 --> 00:33:51,040
Rym: I'm just gonna go to Europe again kind of soon.

614
00:33:51,181 --> 00:33:52,749
Scott: So I'll go to Essen.

615
00:33:53,252 --> 00:33:54,740
Rym: Maybe we should go to Essen sometime.

616
00:33:54,981 --> 00:33:57,274
Scott: I think it's at the same time think I had to choose between that and packs out.

617
00:33:57,475 --> 00:33:58,320
Scott: They're both in October.

618
00:33:59,602 --> 00:34:04,240
Scott: The problem is Essen would just be fun if they're not in the same exact time in October, they're pretty close, right?

619
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:09,360
Rym: So that'd be difficult as a conundrum because Essen would be fun to go to like just objectively.

620
00:34:09,902 --> 00:34:22,708
Rym: But PAX South is a very fruitful convention for us as performing in Australia and entertainers PAX Australia is also fruitful because yeah, you think our panels fill at PAX South or PAX East our panels fucking fill.

621
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:23,831
Scott: Thanks, Australia.

622
00:34:23,851 --> 00:34:25,338
Scott: The country is desperate for nerdery.

623
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:27,659
Rym: Yeah I mean remember when I first started the patreon.

624
00:34:28,681 --> 00:34:30,190
Scott: So you get for living far away from everything.

625
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:30,752
Scott: the mayor.

626
00:34:31,074 --> 00:34:39,659
Scott: and the thing is I when I went there I thought there would be so much better nerdery because they're so close to Japan, which is the fountain of nerdery, but no Japan's still pretty far away from Australia.

627
00:34:40,001 --> 00:34:57,514
Rym: I started researching to start our patreon literally because when I said that we probably wouldn't go to that pad the last PAX Australia Meaning you're skipping our first packs ever as GeekNights More than a dozen people like 14 or 15 people Independently reached out to me and we're like, so how much would it take?

628
00:34:57,575 --> 00:34:58,780
Rym: like what if we donate money?

629
00:34:59,021 --> 00:35:00,480
Rym: Like what if we do a collection sure?

630
00:35:02,624 --> 00:35:04,040
Scott: Listen don't give money to the patreon.

631
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:09,780
Scott: But if you want to give me $1400 to buy a plane ticket to Australia, that's okay at the current patreon levels.

632
00:35:10,382 --> 00:35:14,315
Rym: We could just use that to fund a trip to Australia for packs.

633
00:35:14,756 --> 00:35:15,338
Rym: We just have to.

634
00:35:15,459 --> 00:35:17,044
Scott: you're making $1400 a year.

635
00:35:17,941 --> 00:35:19,815
Rym: Yeah, we're making like 250 a month.

636
00:35:19,815 --> 00:35:31,800
Rym: 250 times 12 is Yeah, all right As soon as we use the patreon money for something then we're obligated to make like.

637
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,938
Rym: You know how we did those videos and that they look we're gonna spend the whole con making videos.

638
00:35:36,181 --> 00:35:38,934
Scott: Why I can't just buy a plane ticket to Australia and go to the coral reef.

639
00:35:39,597 --> 00:35:42,490
Rym: I Don't you hate I don't think that's what the patrons expect.

640
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:43,614
Scott: They've gave their money.

641
00:35:43,635 --> 00:35:44,920
Scott: That's not their money anymore.

642
00:35:45,502 --> 00:35:46,425
Scott: I told them they're stupid.

643
00:35:46,445 --> 00:35:47,047
Scott: They don't listen.

644
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:49,053
Rym: We could do a show live underwater.

645
00:35:49,093 --> 00:35:49,896
Scott: They're upset.

646
00:35:49,956 --> 00:35:50,919
Scott: I'm gonna say I told you.

647
00:35:50,959 --> 00:35:52,865
Scott: so Come on.

648
00:35:52,885 --> 00:35:55,975
Scott: so Preparation.

649
00:35:57,841 --> 00:35:59,940
Scott: Yeah, so we didn't have a show idea for today.

650
00:36:00,081 --> 00:36:06,055
Rym: But I know I know the worst thing is we came up with a bunch of show ideas But they all required at least 15 minutes worth of research.

651
00:36:06,075 --> 00:36:06,960
Scott: That's every show idea.

652
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:12,460
Scott: But anyway, so I realized you know lately, you know, there's those certain things that you like you notice more lately, right?

653
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,580
Scott: So like you learn you learn a new word.

654
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:19,528
Scott: I forget the name for this thing is but you learn a new word Bears everywhere exactly.

655
00:36:19,608 --> 00:36:23,540
Scott: so lately I've noticed a lot more preppers or at least prepper attitudes.

656
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:29,820
Scott: You know people saying like oh man gotta have your grab bag, you know your go bag in case something happens.

657
00:36:30,201 --> 00:36:33,410
Rym: I don't think it is more common more talk more.

658
00:36:33,831 --> 00:36:41,164
Scott: No, I'm just saying and lately I've noticed more talk of things like shelters or Survivalist attitude.

659
00:36:41,285 --> 00:36:44,978
Scott: I will say I've noticed less people saying they would move away from the city.

660
00:36:44,998 --> 00:36:53,101
Rym: so that you know I think that peaked in terms of me running into it in the early 2000s like 2002 2003.

661
00:36:53,101 --> 00:36:58,178
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I'm just no I'm not saying it's peaked I'm saying I'm noticing it more lately than I did a little while ago.

662
00:36:59,162 --> 00:37:03,497
Scott: It's increasing right now in my in my perspective of anecdotal living.

663
00:37:03,677 --> 00:37:08,839
Rym: now on the side Fun fact my mom basically bought a house that was kind of built and owned by preppers like that.

664
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,585
Scott: But your mom is not a prepper.

665
00:37:10,626 --> 00:37:13,656
Rym: No, but she has a prepper compound basically.

666
00:37:13,777 --> 00:37:15,061
Scott: I mean, it doesn't hurt It's like.

667
00:37:15,342 --> 00:37:21,542
Rym: it's like she has a well when Arizona is a dried desert husk with no people living in it You mean my mom's.

668
00:37:21,562 --> 00:37:23,951
Scott: well, isn't that what Arizona is?

669
00:37:24,253 --> 00:37:25,859
Rym: It's a dried house, but there's still people in it.

670
00:37:26,361 --> 00:37:36,546
Rym: Sure, but when there's no people because all the water is gone My mom's well, but I mean still there's no water there either is if you dig deep enough There's really water under there.

671
00:37:36,786 --> 00:37:46,161
Rym: Yeah you so I did the well on this property is Ridiculous like Ridiculous.

672
00:37:46,362 --> 00:37:48,690
Rym: how much of a well they put on.

673
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:53,747
Rym: this is the kind of well you would put on a secret government facility That needed to survive the atomic.

674
00:37:53,808 --> 00:37:56,076
Scott: but I mean, I don't understand how there's water under there.

675
00:37:56,096 --> 00:38:01,120
Scott: if I go to the Sahara Desert I mean sure there are spots where you can dig and there will be water but not every spot.

676
00:38:01,281 --> 00:38:03,060
Rym: How deep do you think a well is?

677
00:38:05,421 --> 00:38:09,979
Scott: Now you're already thinking you got to go basically under the bedrock to where the water table is.

678
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:12,540
Rym: The water table is under the bedrock.

679
00:38:12,761 --> 00:38:17,360
Rym: I'm pretty sure it is, you know about as much about hydrology as you do out the Supreme Court.

680
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:21,680
Scott: It sounds like I know know much about hydrology or geology, but you got to dig through rocks.

681
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,886
Scott: It's not just like under the dirt.

682
00:38:23,107 --> 00:38:23,931
Rym: So my mom deals.

683
00:38:23,971 --> 00:38:24,453
Scott: It's not like.

684
00:38:24,473 --> 00:38:25,880
Scott: it's not dirt water rocks.

685
00:38:26,121 --> 00:38:27,711
Scott: Anyway, dirt rocks water rocks.

686
00:38:27,791 --> 00:38:32,429
Rym: My mom lives in a place Where the people around like an example.

687
00:38:32,449 --> 00:38:37,497
Rym: if you go to the feed store because you just pick up feed like the horses and everything The people there doesn't grow it.

688
00:38:38,523 --> 00:38:39,351
Rym: It's the desert.

689
00:38:39,674 --> 00:38:43,814
Rym: all right You could grow it in other parts of Arizona, but not that.

690
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:44,940
Scott: well, you can't irrigate with that.

691
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,467
Rym: Well, I guess you could but you don't want to dry the well.

692
00:38:47,487 --> 00:38:48,489
Scott: I don't get some sand.

693
00:38:49,011 --> 00:38:59,800
Rym: Anyway, the they're like people at the feed store Literally think that Obama is gonna get a third term and literally come with European troops and literally take their guns.

694
00:38:59,941 --> 00:39:01,919
Scott: Well, I mean that's a person who lives in the desert.

695
00:39:02,161 --> 00:39:04,049
Scott: Yeah, who gives a fuck those people?

696
00:39:04,129 --> 00:39:06,540
Rym: so my mom lives in a place where there's a lot of prep.

697
00:39:06,641 --> 00:39:14,320
Scott: I mean, I would give more credit to the scorpion living in the desert and the Gila monster Not a Scorpio then to the person like Scorpio right like a Gila monster.

698
00:39:14,421 --> 00:39:15,648
Scott: The desert is a native environment.

699
00:39:15,689 --> 00:39:17,299
Scott: a person living in the desert is dumb.

700
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:23,638
Rym: People went into environments that weren't native to them and then just made bent them to their will with technology.

701
00:39:23,718 --> 00:39:25,382
Scott: Yes, that's Adventuring.

702
00:39:25,422 --> 00:39:26,246
Scott: it's also dumb.

703
00:39:26,607 --> 00:39:27,431
Rym: venturing is amazing.

704
00:39:27,652 --> 00:39:29,540
Scott: live in a comfortable place.

705
00:39:30,022 --> 00:39:33,479
Rym: So here's the extent of what I have prepared for.

706
00:39:33,982 --> 00:39:40,033
Rym: Let's start with that like what we've each prepared for because I've prepared for Problems money can solve by getting money.

707
00:39:40,053 --> 00:39:41,060
Rym: Yeah, but that's easy.

708
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:41,663
Rym: I can't so.

709
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:45,240
Rym: but how do you per so like when I try and money don't use it all?

710
00:39:45,604 --> 00:39:46,920
Scott: Well, here's a very specific example.

711
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:55,940
Rym: So I travel to a lot of foreign countries very often Mm-hmm, and I've traveled to places that are not the safest places pretty often.

712
00:39:56,060 --> 00:40:01,800
Scott: Hmm, and I might actually are we talking Somalia unsafe or are we talking like New York City?

713
00:40:02,703 --> 00:40:06,630
Rym: I'm talking like Istanbul current situation unsafe.

714
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:09,200
Scott: Well, I mean if you stay in the city is mostly okay.

715
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:11,544
Rym: More that's the problem.

716
00:40:11,564 --> 00:40:13,891
Scott: Are you worried about like protests getting?

717
00:40:13,972 --> 00:40:16,620
Rym: No, there was a terror attack in Istanbul not that long ago.

718
00:40:16,821 --> 00:40:18,649
Scott: Oh, I mean, that's I mean that's anywhere right?

719
00:40:18,669 --> 00:40:20,659
Scott: No, but it was a terror attack in New York not long ago.

720
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:23,340
Rym: No No, I'm talking like very recently.

721
00:40:23,781 --> 00:40:25,566
Rym: Also, there hadn't been attacks like that before yet.

722
00:40:25,586 --> 00:40:33,586
Rym: There are attacks in other parts of Turkey all the time And there are terror attacks in Paris Specifically targeted foreigners like me attacking the kind of place.

723
00:40:33,646 --> 00:40:35,332
Rym: I would be mmm Like it's.

724
00:40:35,613 --> 00:40:36,075
Rym: that's like.

725
00:40:36,276 --> 00:40:37,821
Rym: I'm not saying I'm a coward like.

726
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:41,998
Rym: I'll still go to Istanbul again probably soon But I will not go hang out.

727
00:40:42,078 --> 00:40:44,107
Scott: I mean, there's a much worse attack in Paris.

728
00:40:44,127 --> 00:40:44,670
Scott: Would you go there?

729
00:40:45,051 --> 00:40:47,428
Rym: Yeah, actually that attack was real near where I stay.

730
00:40:47,791 --> 00:40:48,964
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know.

731
00:40:49,611 --> 00:40:53,104
Rym: But when I travel to those places, I do a few things.

732
00:40:53,365 --> 00:40:57,263
Rym: if I'm not in my hotel room I always have my passport with me.

733
00:40:57,283 --> 00:40:58,570
Scott: Yeah, no matter what.

734
00:40:58,821 --> 00:40:58,970
Scott: Yeah.

735
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:02,524
Scott: But if someone stops you and it's like papers, please most places aren't like that actually.

736
00:41:02,564 --> 00:41:11,490
Scott: and actually if someone says papers Please they don't fucking get my passport Obviously, but what if you need to like run to the consulate or something you in your passports in your hotel room?

737
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:12,830
Scott: That's not a good situation.

738
00:41:13,034 --> 00:41:18,530
Rym: that would actually Usually be fine because if you get to the consulate they can issue an emergency passport to get you the hell out of you.

739
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:20,276
Scott: But it's much easier if you just have one.

740
00:41:20,296 --> 00:41:24,229
Rym: I keep my passport with me just because I don't want.

741
00:41:24,951 --> 00:41:30,930
Rym: I want to be able to if something goes wrong leave the country normally without having to go back to my hotel.

742
00:41:31,251 --> 00:41:35,126
Rym: Yeah, also, I don't want to have to go to the console if someone finds your dead body.

743
00:41:35,146 --> 00:41:36,070
Scott: They'll know who you were.

744
00:41:36,532 --> 00:41:38,701
Rym: No, I'm pretty sure the American passports are valuable enough.

745
00:41:38,721 --> 00:41:39,283
Rym: They just take it.

746
00:41:39,564 --> 00:41:42,298
Scott: if they even were thinking about that Maybe they just think about murdering you.

747
00:41:42,459 --> 00:41:43,444
Rym: I don't think anyone thinks.

748
00:41:43,464 --> 00:41:44,410
Rym: Hey, let's just murder that guy.

749
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:48,350
Scott: Well, I don't think anyone thinks let's make a terror attack and then steal all the Americans passports.

750
00:41:48,551 --> 00:41:50,499
Scott: They think let's make a terror attack and get on the news.

751
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:51,442
Rym: It's a random mugging.

752
00:41:51,463 --> 00:41:52,567
Rym: They're gonna take my passport.

753
00:41:52,647 --> 00:41:52,969
Scott: Yes.

754
00:41:53,109 --> 00:41:53,671
Scott: Yes They will.

755
00:41:53,732 --> 00:41:57,727
Rym: but in the hotel room, you know that safe that no one uses.

756
00:41:57,767 --> 00:42:01,007
Rym: I use that safe You know, I put in that safe if I'm in a country like that.

757
00:42:01,027 --> 00:42:01,370
Scott: I use that.

758
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:03,417
Rym: So I do that in any kind pretty much anywhere.

759
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:06,268
Rym: I travel I don't use it going to PAX what I put in.

760
00:42:07,072 --> 00:42:11,300
Rym: Sometimes I do in facts, but usually instead of putting the safe I just put what I'm about to tell you.

761
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:11,983
Rym: I put in the safe.

762
00:42:12,245 --> 00:42:15,963
Rym: just in the room somewhere I put my backup credit card.

763
00:42:15,984 --> 00:42:22,690
Rym: I Put like 50 bucks Mm-hmm and one of my IDs like a driver's license or something.

764
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:26,808
Scott: I would put anything valuable electronically that I wasn't going to bring around with me.

765
00:42:26,828 --> 00:42:32,700
Scott: like my camera I'm probably carrying but like if I wasn't carrying every lens with me Even if I brought I wouldn't even bring them to a country like that.

766
00:42:32,741 --> 00:42:35,032
Scott: probably cuz you only need to bring a few travel Photography.

767
00:42:35,172 --> 00:42:36,357
Scott: you don't bring a lot of lenses, right?

768
00:42:36,537 --> 00:42:40,170
Scott: Yeah, but like laptop, you know iPad, I'm not carrying around all day.

769
00:42:40,211 --> 00:42:40,941
Scott: That's going in the safe.

770
00:42:41,043 --> 00:42:42,394
Rym: See no no So you're that's that's.

771
00:42:42,474 --> 00:42:46,330
Rym: I think that's orthogonal to our point cuz that's just like avoid theft comment.

772
00:42:47,633 --> 00:42:53,629
Scott: None of this is talking about the prepper type people who worried about like the flood or you know, any, you know nuclear.

773
00:42:53,649 --> 00:43:10,290
Rym: well I'll make it relevant that we can go back to the nuclear war nonsense, but I basically I do when I travel Put a stay cash of ID credit card and some cash Separate from my regular supply of credit card ID and cash.

774
00:43:10,732 --> 00:43:21,795
Rym: So say like someone steals my bag that has my passport and my wallet in it Well, as long as I can somehow get back to my hotel room, but if you don't have the keys to your hotel I just stole those.

775
00:43:21,955 --> 00:43:25,469
Rym: I'm pretty sure I would be able to talk to the front desk without an ID.

776
00:43:25,771 --> 00:43:27,056
Scott: They'll give you keys to a room.

777
00:43:27,357 --> 00:43:28,763
Rym: I could probably make that happen.

778
00:43:29,004 --> 00:43:31,413
Scott: It's I mean, yeah, it's not too hard But that's tough.

779
00:43:31,694 --> 00:43:32,577
Rym: I could make that happen.

780
00:43:32,717 --> 00:43:35,807
Scott: Yeah, but also actually I think it is a pain in the ass.

781
00:43:36,228 --> 00:43:49,509
Rym: my hotel key I always put in a pocket separate from all my other stuff obviously But I have enough stuff to be able to afford to like take a cab to the airport Enough ID to at least convince them who I am like all that stuff.

782
00:43:50,372 --> 00:43:52,779
Rym: So in my real life like outside of travel.

783
00:43:53,220 --> 00:44:03,004
Rym: the amount of preparation I do is if there's a huge huge storm coming I don't buy anything different at all But I do fill the tub with water if it's like a hurricane.

784
00:44:03,185 --> 00:44:03,466
Rym: That's it.

785
00:44:03,486 --> 00:44:07,423
Rym: It's all I do If the storm is coming and I only do that.

786
00:44:07,624 --> 00:44:14,042
Rym: so one emergency I guess I give the rabbits water but two so I can flush the toilet if Water pressure goes away for a few days.

787
00:44:14,183 --> 00:44:16,515
Scott: if the storm is coming I close the windows.

788
00:44:17,298 --> 00:44:18,060
Scott: and if it's what?

789
00:44:18,101 --> 00:44:21,914
Scott: if there's like there was a travel ban, I think in the winter this year I just stay home, right?

790
00:44:21,975 --> 00:44:23,782
Scott: I stay obviously but I don't buy anything.

791
00:44:23,923 --> 00:44:25,750
Scott: I couldn't get delivery with the travel ban.

792
00:44:26,031 --> 00:44:29,648
Rym: So I made yeah, you could actually the grub hub was working fine during the travel ban.

793
00:44:29,688 --> 00:44:30,030
Rym: Really?

794
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:30,972
Scott: Yeah, I did not.

795
00:44:31,173 --> 00:44:32,279
Scott: I was not able to grow up up.

796
00:44:32,299 --> 00:44:34,350
Rym: delivery guys were biking walking there.

797
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:37,745
Scott: I kept looking out the window to see if there was any and there weren't.

798
00:44:37,826 --> 00:44:41,710
Rym: so there are pictures on guy delivery men literally wearing snowshoes.

799
00:44:42,491 --> 00:44:48,530
Scott: Well, I wish I would have known that but basically my preparation was given like a $20 tip if someone delivered some pizza.

800
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:49,473
Rym: Yeah, I bought.

801
00:44:49,493 --> 00:44:54,189
Scott: I bought a box of macaroni and cheese so I would have something to eat and you know.

802
00:44:54,671 --> 00:44:57,609
Rym: But I if like say civilization like civil order broke down.

803
00:44:58,353 --> 00:45:00,544
Rym: There's only like a week's worth of food in my apartment.

804
00:45:00,584 --> 00:45:03,758
Scott: Like I don't have enough food I usually only have like two days of food.

805
00:45:03,878 --> 00:45:06,790
Rym: Well when I say a week's worth, I mean like there's pasta.

806
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:08,718
Rym: We haven't eaten that I guess we could cook.

807
00:45:08,879 --> 00:45:09,100
Scott: Yeah.

808
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,064
Scott: Okay, plain pasta.

809
00:45:10,084 --> 00:45:10,727
Scott: That'll be delicious.

810
00:45:10,747 --> 00:45:11,510
Rym: Yeah, but it's food.

811
00:45:11,912 --> 00:45:13,158
Scott: I guess I'm frozen food.

812
00:45:13,198 --> 00:45:14,525
Scott: I can make a lot of banana breads.

813
00:45:14,665 --> 00:45:15,610
Rym: I've got a bunch of rice.

814
00:45:15,791 --> 00:45:17,704
Rym: I got enough rice to keep me going for maybe a couple weeks.

815
00:45:17,764 --> 00:45:18,670
Scott: Yeah, I got plenty of rice.

816
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:25,490
Rym: I could rice it up, but my philosophy in terms of by rice in bulk actually an Amazon is that I live in New York.

817
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:29,069
Rym: Any disaster that is big enough?

818
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:38,785
Rym: Such that by the power of walking alone I cannot within 24 hours get to a place where civil order still remains.

819
00:45:39,548 --> 00:45:42,762
Rym: I was fucked anyway And there's literally nothing I could have ever done to help myself.

820
00:45:42,862 --> 00:45:44,330
Scott: Yeah, you could have not lived in New York.

821
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:45,434
Scott: Which preppers do that's?

822
00:45:45,454 --> 00:45:57,210
Scott: the first thing they do is they move and live in the middle of nowhere because they think the society Collapses if there's riots or there's nuclear war There's fires or floods they will be far away from all that stuff and there's farms near them.

823
00:45:57,270 --> 00:46:05,350
Scott: But I've spent time that they live in can be a self-sustaining Human you know nurturing place even if all other society is destroyed.

824
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:08,930
Rym: I've lived or spent time or had family members who do live in very remote areas.

825
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:10,530
Scott: You know what, you know, but they're ridiculously deep.

826
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:19,161
Rym: well if you're not a if you're not a prepper you still need to do a lot of preparation because like in New York a Mundane disaster like the power goes out.

827
00:46:19,222 --> 00:46:20,188
Rym: I can just deal with it.

828
00:46:21,313 --> 00:46:22,800
Rym: You know stuff happens the water.

829
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:23,603
Scott: they got generators.

830
00:46:23,643 --> 00:46:23,985
Scott: They're good.

831
00:46:24,266 --> 00:46:28,062
Rym: say the Water supply stops like say my buildings water break.

832
00:46:28,102 --> 00:46:28,805
Scott: They have wells.

833
00:46:28,885 --> 00:46:29,327
Scott: They don't need.

834
00:46:29,347 --> 00:46:33,581
Rym: they don't have that problem yeah, but so if here's the here's the difference in New York.

835
00:46:34,003 --> 00:46:42,996
Rym: if the well pump system like the distribution water system for my local part of the city like my building or my block breaks down I Can go to the bodega and buy water.

836
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:48,410
Rym: if you live out in the middle of nowhere stop delivering it Yeah, but in the short term like in the immediate term.

837
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:53,550
Scott: Yes, if you live in the middle of no preppers are not worried about a short-term problem They're worried about the big one.

838
00:46:53,785 --> 00:46:58,227
Rym: No But I'm saying short term problems become a much bigger deal if you live in a remote place.

839
00:46:58,528 --> 00:47:08,909
Rym: if the well Pump system breaks on your well, and you live in like Northern Michigan It's actually like you've got a travel significant distance to get water let alone get the parts to fix your well.

840
00:47:10,191 --> 00:47:12,230
Scott: Usually you just call someone who would come and fix your well.

841
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:20,288
Scott: Yeah, but if civil orders breaking down you think that well person is gonna come and fix your fucking well I guess he better know how to fix your own well, but the preppers are not really rational.

842
00:47:20,448 --> 00:47:30,209
Rym: Yeah I'm just talking about the rational amount of preparation I do like when I when we like when I was a kid we lived in places where there wasn't an exotic animal hospital within walking distance.

843
00:47:30,832 --> 00:47:38,487
Rym: We kept a bunch of medical supplies in case like there was a medical emergency like dog gets hurt or something like we had medical supplies we could do sutures and stitches and things.

844
00:47:38,688 --> 00:47:46,901
Rym: and Actually if I lived like in upstate, New York like the top part in New York like I guess Oh the real upstate New York north of Albany, New.

845
00:47:47,042 --> 00:47:49,833
Rym: actually someone gave me some terminology I'm gonna start using.

846
00:47:49,873 --> 00:47:50,616
Rym: I just remembered this.

847
00:47:50,957 --> 00:47:51,900
Rym: they said that Canada.

848
00:47:52,321 --> 00:47:54,026
Rym: No they said there are.

849
00:47:54,207 --> 00:47:55,230
Rym: here are the regions of New York.

850
00:47:55,310 --> 00:47:56,736
Rym: There's New York City, which is New York.

851
00:47:56,876 --> 00:48:06,102
Rym: yes, there's upstate which means anywhere along the New York State Thruway There's outstate which means north of the New York State Thruway.

852
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:07,667
Scott: What about the Elmira Corning area?

853
00:48:07,687 --> 00:48:08,370
Scott: That's south of the Thruway.

854
00:48:08,531 --> 00:48:14,477
Rym: That's Penn State Penn State in upstate Downstate outstate.

855
00:48:15,061 --> 00:48:16,210
Rym: those are the four parts of New York.

856
00:48:16,933 --> 00:48:18,100
Rym: I'm gonna use this terminology.

857
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:24,596
Scott: if it's on 87 or 90 Upstate but 87. what about the part where 87 keeps going into outstate?

858
00:48:24,877 --> 00:48:26,599
Scott: That's not the Thruway, but it's still 87 the Thruway.

859
00:48:27,792 --> 00:48:36,994
Scott: Originally you're the one who said only it's only 87 and 90 and not say 90. so 90 east of 87 doesn't count and 87 north of 90.

860
00:48:36,994 --> 00:48:38,243
Rym: You can just say the New York State Thruway.

861
00:48:38,283 --> 00:48:39,330
Rym: That's a designated road.

862
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:48,012
Rym: I'm just saying unless you're within a feel like some small number of miles of the New York State Thruway and Yonkers.

863
00:48:48,072 --> 00:48:48,975
Rym: but now you're upstate.

864
00:48:48,995 --> 00:48:52,125
Scott: the thing is 90 east of 87 really isn't?

865
00:48:52,426 --> 00:48:53,570
Scott: it's a lot like upstate.

866
00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:54,593
Scott: It's not like outstate.

867
00:48:54,914 --> 00:48:56,239
Rym: You know what there's a let's say.

868
00:48:56,259 --> 00:48:57,624
Rym: There's a buffer anywhere.

869
00:48:57,664 --> 00:48:59,510
Rym: There's a big city like you're on Albany or Syracuse.

870
00:48:59,794 --> 00:49:00,403
Rym: That's upstate.

871
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,480
Rym: Like the area around Albany is upstate.

872
00:49:03,681 --> 00:49:04,666
Rym: you get north of Albany.

873
00:49:04,686 --> 00:49:05,450
Rym: That's outstate.

874
00:49:08,584 --> 00:49:11,739
Rym: Yeah Preppers yeah, this is your idea.

875
00:49:11,759 --> 00:49:13,347
Rym: you got more to say other than those.

876
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:16,910
Scott: people are dumb Dumb and crazy, and they're worried about some like disaster.

877
00:49:17,071 --> 00:49:17,996
Scott: And it's not gonna happen.

878
00:49:18,036 --> 00:49:20,770
Scott: and even if it does happen their preparation isn't really gonna help them.

879
00:49:21,011 --> 00:49:32,553
Scott: It's not gonna be like some zombie attack movie where you escape the city And you find some guy who still lives at his house And he's got all the canned goods and you're safe now for at least a while until you until you know you have Interhuman troubles.

880
00:49:32,593 --> 00:49:33,476
Rym: well, that's getting it.

881
00:49:33,536 --> 00:49:37,550
Scott: you go out there, and that guy's dead already and maybe this canned food there.

882
00:49:38,106 --> 00:49:42,401
Scott: Yeah Like that's what always Amazing about the preppers and you didn't even make it out there because you're dead.

883
00:49:42,461 --> 00:49:44,589
Rym: to people who prudently prepare for things like.

884
00:49:45,495 --> 00:49:46,141
Rym: Here's the difference.

885
00:49:46,545 --> 00:49:57,648
Rym: a prepper spends a lot of time and money on like learning how to do basic farming and like learning how to smelt iron and learning how to start fires from nothing.

886
00:49:57,669 --> 00:50:01,690
Rym: a Real prepper as in someone who is preparing for something lit that could happen.

887
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:08,150
Rym: Matches and lighters will still exist for decades after the breakdown of civil order.

888
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:10,759
Rym: There are so many lighters in the world.

889
00:50:10,779 --> 00:50:16,129
Rym: I don't think you need to be able to start a fire with Flint I think you'll be able to find a lighter.

890
00:50:17,603 --> 00:50:24,990
Scott: so If the fuel in the lighter is decomposed or leaked out you can get a match or just find another light.

891
00:50:24,990 --> 00:50:26,509
Scott: I mean the bodega next to me.

892
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:27,838
Scott: Do you know how many matches they have?

893
00:50:27,898 --> 00:50:29,850
Scott: if I'm like the only one left alive in Astoria?

894
00:50:30,311 --> 00:50:36,850
Rym: I will have so many matches, but like there is no scenario ever Where the prepper guy out the middle of nowhere?

895
00:50:37,571 --> 00:50:46,870
Rym: Knowing how to sew wheats and run a farm Like his own farm to rebuild society is actually gonna matter appreciably doesn't even have the manpower.

896
00:50:47,031 --> 00:50:51,770
Scott: Even if he could sew the wheat, you can't harvest the wheat and mill it and do the baking.

897
00:50:51,851 --> 00:50:52,676
Scott: It is not enough people.

898
00:50:52,696 --> 00:50:54,810
Rym: That's almost like you'll need to recreate society.

899
00:50:55,131 --> 00:50:56,778
Rym: I just I don't think any situation.

900
00:50:56,798 --> 00:50:58,143
Scott: how many babies are they gonna make?

901
00:50:58,484 --> 00:51:00,030
Rym: any situation where?

902
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:05,908
Rym: Some of the cities don't survive is a situation where don't worry about it.

903
00:51:05,928 --> 00:51:06,590
Rym: That's Mad Max.

904
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:11,230
Rym: That's that's such a different paradigm of existence that all that preparation was literally meaningless.

905
00:51:12,112 --> 00:51:18,588
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I just imagine the guy like you know Everyone's like the even the city people tend to have like the go bag like if something happens I can grab this and run.

906
00:51:18,609 --> 00:51:20,174
Scott: now We are like, all right.

907
00:51:20,214 --> 00:51:21,840
Scott: So what situation happened?

908
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:26,858
Scott: We have to grab this and run newt goes off in downtown, Manhattan Okay, we're disintegrated.

909
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:30,932
Rym: Anyway, that's not that big Didn't?

910
00:51:30,952 --> 00:51:34,170
Scott: we just do an episode about how thermonuclear weapons are so enormous.

911
00:51:35,511 --> 00:51:38,866
Rym: You didn't really pay attention that thermonuclear weapons did exist.

912
00:51:38,926 --> 00:51:49,902
Rym: that are that enormous Modern thermonuclear weapons let alone the kind of device that would let if it was likely to happen what happened in New York Would not touch us where we are in Queen.

913
00:51:49,943 --> 00:51:51,088
Scott: I mean, we're still not gonna make it.

914
00:51:51,792 --> 00:51:52,255
Rym: Oh, why not?

915
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:55,613
Rym: Actually, that's a very survival thing for us Really?

916
00:51:55,713 --> 00:51:57,402
Scott: Yeah, how what are you gonna do?

917
00:51:57,442 --> 00:51:58,166
Scott: So you go outside?

918
00:51:58,186 --> 00:51:58,850
Scott: You're all radiate.

919
00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:04,610
Rym: Actually a an air burst of a thermonuke like a modern one that would take out lower Manhattan.

920
00:52:05,293 --> 00:52:08,710
Rym: The radiation exposure here would not be significant.

921
00:52:09,451 --> 00:52:09,953
Scott: All right, good.

922
00:52:10,354 --> 00:52:14,267
Rym: If it was a ground burst it would become very significant over the course of days.

923
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:15,373
Scott: How do you know?

924
00:52:15,393 --> 00:52:15,876
Scott: they're not gonna.

925
00:52:16,138 --> 00:52:17,790
Scott: you know, you think they're gonna shoot just one in New York.

926
00:52:17,790 --> 00:52:19,025
Scott: They're not gonna like hit Queens - yeah.

927
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:26,694
Rym: So again, I'm not talking about global thermonuclear war is again a scenario where fuck it you're fine But you don't think it.

928
00:52:27,035 --> 00:52:31,370
Scott: regular bombs that's gonna land on you, but imagine the much you're gonna lucky.

929
00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:31,972
Scott: You're the building.

930
00:52:31,992 --> 00:52:32,715
Scott: that's not gonna be a ball.

931
00:52:32,775 --> 00:52:33,939
Rym: regular bombs gonna get here.

932
00:52:33,999 --> 00:52:36,889
Rym: What countries have capabilities to bomb the United States?

933
00:52:37,472 --> 00:52:37,874
Scott: not many.

934
00:52:38,095 --> 00:52:40,826
Rym: but here's a plausible but unrealistic scenario.

935
00:52:40,846 --> 00:52:45,450
Rym: Scott a Terrorist sets off a nuke in downtown Manhattan destroying like a job.

936
00:52:45,510 --> 00:52:49,039
Scott: It's some if it's one that can be set off right carried.

937
00:52:49,761 --> 00:52:51,385
Scott: It's not really gonna hurt us over here.

938
00:52:51,827 --> 00:52:55,118
Rym: Uh a There are bombs that could be carried.

939
00:52:55,138 --> 00:52:57,869
Scott: let's say let's make it let's get let's get worse though, right?

940
00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:01,057
Scott: The nuke in Manhattan doesn't matter what kind.

941
00:53:01,578 --> 00:53:02,240
Scott: you're at work.

942
00:53:02,401 --> 00:53:03,263
Scott: You're in Manhattan.

943
00:53:03,845 --> 00:53:04,065
Rym: Yeah.

944
00:53:04,286 --> 00:53:04,587
Scott: All right.

945
00:53:04,988 --> 00:53:05,590
Scott: You're not a home.

946
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:07,676
Rym: So what would I do?

947
00:53:07,696 --> 00:53:09,865
Scott: In fact, you're on the street walking a lunch.

948
00:53:09,946 --> 00:53:14,081
Rym: You're not even in a building Yep, so the new goes off in downtown, Tribeca, right?

949
00:53:14,101 --> 00:53:15,546
Scott: There's a flash you can't see now.

950
00:53:15,646 --> 00:53:15,887
Rym: Yep.

951
00:53:16,087 --> 00:53:18,100
Rym: You're on the street Yep, so it happened.

952
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:19,209
Scott: Well, you got a few seconds.

953
00:53:19,912 --> 00:53:26,981
Rym: No, cuz it wouldn't I wouldn't do within the kind of bomb that would actually be likely in that not improbable scenario.

954
00:53:27,001 --> 00:53:30,630
Rym: is Not the kind of bomb that would disintegrate me even at that radius?

955
00:53:31,392 --> 00:53:32,320
Rym: Probably be okay.

956
00:53:32,623 --> 00:53:37,022
Scott: Just days Yeah, no one's gonna die when the new goes off near them.

957
00:53:37,043 --> 00:53:41,035
Scott: Yeah, how near You're in downtown Manhattan.

958
00:53:41,075 --> 00:53:45,670
Rym: Let's say let's say we're both in Midtown doing something and a new goes off in downtown.

959
00:53:46,296 --> 00:53:47,589
Scott: I'm saying it goes off near you.

960
00:53:48,276 --> 00:53:50,292
Rym: Well, if it's close enough to vaporize me It didn't matter.

961
00:53:50,312 --> 00:53:54,567
Rym: if I'm outside of these significant blast radius, then I'm probably gonna survive.

962
00:53:54,587 --> 00:53:55,290
Rym: and I actually have a plan.

963
00:53:55,937 --> 00:53:56,484
Scott: What's your plan?

964
00:53:56,545 --> 00:53:56,869
Scott: run away?

965
00:53:57,270 --> 00:54:03,270
Rym: So I would basically head northeast and I'd have to get over the river into Queens Long Island as fast as possible.

966
00:54:03,491 --> 00:54:06,763
Scott: However, I do it because we're gonna swim over the East River.

967
00:54:07,144 --> 00:54:09,991
Rym: that that's a pretty easy swim It's.

968
00:54:10,292 --> 00:54:11,777
Scott: it's not the distance isn't the problem.

969
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:13,423
Rym: Well, then what's the problem?

970
00:54:13,543 --> 00:54:15,450
Scott: The water is probably more deadly than the radiation.

971
00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:16,534
Rym: Not in the short term.

972
00:54:16,574 --> 00:54:19,143
Rym: that slightly increased risk of cancer down the road.

973
00:54:19,484 --> 00:54:22,038
Rym: Maybe some gastrointestinal distress I can do.

974
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,209
Scott: also fish.

975
00:54:24,111 --> 00:54:25,721
Rym: That's not the foot of the fish gonna eat me.

976
00:54:25,862 --> 00:54:26,164
Scott: Yes.

977
00:54:26,345 --> 00:54:27,069
Rym: No, yes.

978
00:54:28,511 --> 00:54:32,274
Rym: so what I actually probably do is Walk over what.

979
00:54:32,294 --> 00:54:35,149
Scott: also you're gonna hit by a boat cuz you might probably not.

980
00:54:35,792 --> 00:54:36,838
Scott: You don't think the boats are gonna.

981
00:54:36,878 --> 00:54:38,930
Scott: you think everyone who's got a boat isn't gonna be using it to go.

982
00:54:38,990 --> 00:54:40,720
Rym: Actually, the boats will probably be clogging the waters.

983
00:54:40,761 --> 00:54:43,757
Rym: I'm gonna jump from boat to boat And also you can't get.

984
00:54:43,777 --> 00:54:52,730
Rym: the boats are so high you I would probably head to The area of next to Roosevelt Island and go across that little bit and then take the bridge in Roosevelt Island to my house.

985
00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:54,416
Scott: Good strategy, but another good strategy.

986
00:54:54,797 --> 00:54:56,443
Scott: See I'm so much smarter than you.

987
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:57,667
Rym: I what's your strategy?

988
00:54:57,827 --> 00:54:58,430
Scott: steal a boat?

989
00:54:59,391 --> 00:55:03,330
Rym: You Scott, you know how to start a boat if it's a boat with a steering wheel.

990
00:55:03,952 --> 00:55:04,976
Rym: Do you know how to steer a boat?

991
00:55:04,996 --> 00:55:05,799
Rym: Cuz at all.

992
00:55:05,999 --> 00:55:06,903
Scott: with the steering wheel.

993
00:55:07,324 --> 00:55:08,850
Rym: if you ever sailboat I got fucked.

994
00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:10,843
Scott: But if it's a powered boat with a steering wheel, I'm good.

995
00:55:11,064 --> 00:55:11,909
Rym: How big is this boat?

996
00:55:12,430 --> 00:55:12,932
Scott: Doesn't matter.

997
00:55:12,952 --> 00:55:14,840
Rym: Yeah, it does because it's really small.

998
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,837
Rym: So and you know what and you know if I get out Have you ever piloted a boat?

999
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:20,244
Scott: Yeah with a steering wheel.

1000
00:55:20,264 --> 00:55:21,349
Rym: It wasn't a swan boat.

1001
00:55:22,934 --> 00:55:26,492
Scott: Also swan boat Boat.

1002
00:55:26,512 --> 00:55:27,095
Rym: you're fucked.

1003
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:30,487
Rym: like you said the water is will be clogged because remember the danger of a new going up.

1004
00:55:30,507 --> 00:55:32,075
Scott: so much water You can just move.

1005
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:33,809
Scott: you're on roads that get jammed with traffic.

1006
00:55:34,512 --> 00:55:37,041
Scott: I just go Scott air helicopters even better.

1007
00:55:37,061 --> 00:55:41,402
Rym: a couple of boats bumping into each other fuck everything forever Only if they're real big.

1008
00:55:41,422 --> 00:55:45,502
Scott: no Do the circle line and probably make an escape you get your boat.

1009
00:55:45,582 --> 00:55:45,723
Rym: Now.

1010
00:55:45,783 --> 00:55:46,526
Rym: What were you gonna go?

1011
00:55:46,686 --> 00:55:47,288
Rym: up or down?

1012
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:49,475
Scott: Depends where the boat is.

1013
00:55:49,495 --> 00:55:51,886
Rym: All right, you get a boat of the East River up or down.

1014
00:55:52,087 --> 00:55:52,770
Scott: where in the East River?

1015
00:55:53,272 --> 00:55:53,554
Rym: I don't know.

1016
00:55:53,594 --> 00:55:56,328
Rym: next to Roosevelt Island you go to the ferry dock and you steal the ferry.

1017
00:55:56,428 --> 00:55:58,636
Scott: Yeah Oh, oh the like the water tax.

1018
00:55:58,656 --> 00:55:58,957
Scott: Yeah.

1019
00:55:59,198 --> 00:56:04,112
Scott: Oh water tax we can go up to where Long Island Sound Connecticut.

1020
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:04,513
Rym: All right.

1021
00:56:04,774 --> 00:56:05,376
Rym: That's your plan.

1022
00:56:05,396 --> 00:56:06,139
Rym: Just bail that way.

1023
00:56:06,159 --> 00:56:06,861
Rym: Yeah, why not?

1024
00:56:07,082 --> 00:56:10,552
Rym: So I have more pressing concerns of Emily's.

1025
00:56:10,572 --> 00:56:13,188
Rym: probably at home somewhere and I got rabbits that I want to save.

1026
00:56:13,389 --> 00:56:16,089
Scott: No Well, I don't know how to need to save anybody here except me.

1027
00:56:16,391 --> 00:56:19,425
Rym: Yeah, so I actually plus you pretty much want to get away.

1028
00:56:19,565 --> 00:56:23,842
Scott: if you go back for people That's always a bad news every time in any sort of zombie movie.

1029
00:56:23,862 --> 00:56:25,870
Scott: when you go back for people all you find is dead people.

1030
00:56:25,931 --> 00:56:27,429
Scott: No, but it's not a good deal.

1031
00:56:27,691 --> 00:56:32,934
Scott: You don't want to see the main character then you find the people and then you have to deal with them and then they die Later and it wasn't worrying.

1032
00:56:32,954 --> 00:56:33,997
Scott: you were doing better off.

1033
00:56:34,218 --> 00:56:44,456
Rym: going west would actually be difficult probably because that's where everyone else is trying to Definitely not going west and while East is a dead end, but Long Island is pretty big It's not a dead end.

1034
00:56:44,477 --> 00:56:46,429
Scott: You got to see and you go to some other country.

1035
00:56:46,510 --> 00:56:47,599
Rym: Well, how are you gonna go out to see?

1036
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:50,861
Scott: those boats are not seaworthy At least in the Hudson River.

1037
00:56:50,881 --> 00:56:52,010
Scott: There's cruise ships you can get on.

1038
00:56:53,111 --> 00:56:53,694
Rym: You're gonna pilot.

1039
00:56:53,714 --> 00:56:55,102
Rym: occurs you're gonna steal a cruise ship.

1040
00:56:55,263 --> 00:56:56,489
Scott: No, but there's a captain on there.

1041
00:56:57,032 --> 00:57:01,610
Rym: Yeah, that cruise ship is already teaming with refugees like streaming onto it falling off freaking out.

1042
00:57:01,812 --> 00:57:03,009
Rym: You didn't get anywhere near that thing.

1043
00:57:03,272 --> 00:57:05,050
Scott: Not if it's just like in-between voyages.

1044
00:57:05,351 --> 00:57:12,272
Scott: Basically my real plan my literal like not even joking plan is I know how to pronounce voyage by the way I just wanted to say voyage Cuz.

1045
00:57:12,292 --> 00:57:14,282
Scott: you know people say bon voyage, right?

1046
00:57:14,322 --> 00:57:15,869
Scott: Yeah, that's they're not saying bond voyage.

1047
00:57:16,911 --> 00:57:26,210
Rym: If shit ever went down in New York, and I had to get away my actual plan is to Basically put the rabbits in backpacks with like a cliff bar or something cuz I've always got those around.

1048
00:57:26,270 --> 00:57:28,140
Scott: Yes, I'm sure the effort of saving the rabbits.

1049
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:28,783
Rym: It's worth it.

1050
00:57:29,084 --> 00:57:30,170
Rym: Okay, I'll save pets.

1051
00:57:30,371 --> 00:57:32,319
Rym: I would save pets in nuclear disaster.

1052
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:37,603
Scott: Listen, the dog can you gotta have dog dog can save itself But just follow you but rabbit is probably okay.

1053
00:57:37,643 --> 00:57:38,788
Rym: Let's put them back back.

1054
00:57:38,808 --> 00:57:39,090
Rym: We're good.

1055
00:57:39,291 --> 00:57:41,209
Scott: I mean, I probably die going back to the river.

1056
00:57:42,978 --> 00:57:50,510
Rym: Bring this back around Preparing to like hunker down and live here through this temporary societal breakdown not worth it.

1057
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:59,790
Rym: I'm not gonna have like a month of food and hide in my apartment with like a water supply growing crops on the roof We and like barricading it waiting for civil order to get restored.

1058
00:57:59,830 --> 00:58:01,356
Scott: No, I could live in DMZ New York.

1059
00:58:01,376 --> 00:58:02,381
Scott: That'd be cool with that.

1060
00:58:02,702 --> 00:58:15,684
Rym: Yeah, I'd rather live in DMZ, New York than modern-day Rural, I only prepare enough to where by getting on my bike and or walking within a day I get to a place where there's still running water and food.

1061
00:58:16,046 --> 00:58:16,730
Scott: Yeah, I could bike away.

1062
00:58:17,011 --> 00:58:20,570
Rym: Yeah, actually biking away is really the best way to get out because the roads be clogged immediately.

1063
00:58:21,113 --> 00:58:24,689
Rym: But once a roads clogged, it's real easy to bike on that road.

1064
00:58:26,131 --> 00:58:30,030
Scott: Really and you know, even if the shoulders clogged it's like well, that's right.

1065
00:58:30,171 --> 00:58:35,076
Scott: Well occasionally when the cars are too close to each other you get off your bike and walk the biggest Over a car.

1066
00:58:35,296 --> 00:58:38,790
Rym: The only actual danger is shit heads who were stuck in their cars trying to steal your bike.

1067
00:58:39,092 --> 00:58:41,750
Rym: So you got to be willing to punch and or shoot a person along the way.

1068
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:47,510
Scott: Well, I mean if there's a Mad Max You're gonna have to start shooting or punching people because you got fist of the North Star power.

1069
00:58:47,510 --> 00:58:49,797
Rym: Yeah, so I'd probably walk across the bridge.

1070
00:58:49,817 --> 00:58:54,091
Rym: you might think but Rym the bridge is especially like the Queensborough Bridge is gonna be completely Fuck.

1071
00:58:54,111 --> 00:58:54,915
Rym: Yes, that's true.

1072
00:58:55,377 --> 00:58:58,290
Scott: Well, you better hope it's structurally sound after depending what happened.

1073
00:58:58,571 --> 00:59:00,859
Rym: Well, if something happened that could a lot of these bridges.

1074
00:59:00,899 --> 00:59:01,742
Scott: bridges are not new.

1075
00:59:02,184 --> 00:59:03,890
Scott: They're not fancy modern bridges, right?

1076
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:06,830
Rym: So I am a very capable boulderer.

1077
00:59:07,332 --> 00:59:15,261
Rym: I could easily because if if it got bad the cops aren't gonna come up on the bridge and stop me They don't give a fuck I would just climb over like the top of the bridge.

1078
00:59:15,623 --> 00:59:22,870
Rym: that actually be really easy to do Avoiding all the dangerous people all the cars all the bullshit that's going on in the regular part of the bridge.

1079
00:59:22,950 --> 00:59:23,552
Scott: Listen, you know what?

1080
00:59:23,593 --> 00:59:25,399
Scott: In fact something interesting right.

1081
00:59:25,459 --> 00:59:27,407
Scott: knowing stuff about the city helps right?

1082
00:59:27,427 --> 00:59:29,061
Scott: It's like the Hellgate bridge Which is right near me.

1083
00:59:29,081 --> 00:59:32,076
Scott: Yep That bridge has been way old.

1084
00:59:32,136 --> 00:59:34,043
Scott: That's like a multi super old bridge.

1085
00:59:34,063 --> 00:59:35,890
Scott: ridiculously old is also a rail bridge.

1086
00:59:36,333 --> 00:59:38,989
Scott: No one's gonna be on it and the trains aren't gonna be running either.

1087
00:59:39,371 --> 00:59:41,219
Scott: I just get up there and walk over.

1088
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:42,063
Scott: people have done that.

1089
00:59:42,083 --> 00:59:43,730
Scott: It's not really a problem.

1090
00:59:44,491 --> 00:59:46,056
Rym: Yep, I actually I know about.

1091
00:59:46,136 --> 00:59:51,609
Rym: I actually know the routes of a lot of the subway tunnels that aren't used or at least aren't used for passenger service.

1092
00:59:52,452 --> 00:59:52,633
Scott: Hmm.

1093
00:59:53,236 --> 00:59:55,007
Scott: So yeah, everything is gonna be safe down there.

1094
00:59:55,108 --> 00:59:57,470
Scott: So Scott Oh, it's not safe down there now.

1095
00:59:57,610 --> 01:00:10,870
Rym: So to go back to your other scenario if a significant if I was close to a nuke that went off that didn't kill me In New York, the most important thing to do Not is just to get away from the possible radiation effects.

1096
01:00:10,991 --> 01:00:15,701
Scott: Well as soon as there are buildings that have little fallout signs on them You just find one of those and go in.

1097
01:00:15,721 --> 01:00:17,050
Rym: the plebs are all gonna go into those.

1098
01:00:17,170 --> 01:00:19,622
Scott: I would probably I don't think the plebs even know to go into those.

1099
01:00:19,662 --> 01:00:23,583
Scott: they make plebs from the 50s No, but plebs modern-day plebs are never taught.

1100
01:00:23,603 --> 01:00:24,730
Rym: Plebs are in the street freaking out.

1101
01:00:24,730 --> 01:00:27,486
Rym: You got to get off the street into one of those nice buildings.

1102
01:00:27,546 --> 01:00:28,210
Rym: I would not do that.

1103
01:00:28,392 --> 01:00:29,890
Rym: I would actually go down into the subway tunnel.

1104
01:00:30,592 --> 01:00:33,230
Scott: Yeah, that's about it about a safe because the people aren't gonna go down there.

1105
01:00:33,290 --> 01:00:36,589
Rym: They're afraid of that shit and I let me tell you subways gonna stop running real quick.

1106
01:00:37,335 --> 01:00:39,029
Scott: No, you better hope the third rail turns off.

1107
01:00:39,772 --> 01:00:44,546
Rym: I am confident that I am capable of not touching the third rail.

1108
01:00:44,566 --> 01:00:45,610
Scott: You never know.

1109
01:00:46,491 --> 01:00:49,450
Rym: Also, I know where a lot of those like secret shafts and paths are down there.

1110
01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:53,630
Rym: I just go down there and walk along all those paths until I could get to Queens.

1111
01:00:54,632 --> 01:00:56,610
Rym: Sure, just staying underground out of the radiation.

1112
01:00:58,012 --> 01:01:00,430
Scott: I'd go more to the Bronx where it's safer.

1113
01:01:00,952 --> 01:01:04,726
Rym: The Bronx is gonna be clogged with refugees streaming north freaking out and killing each other.

1114
01:01:04,746 --> 01:01:05,770
Scott: I'm underground.

1115
01:01:05,891 --> 01:01:11,949
Scott: So they uh, the subway is above ground there Not the a-train.

1116
01:01:13,031 --> 01:01:14,918
Rym: Yeah, but the a-train doesn't go far enough.

1117
01:01:14,938 --> 01:01:15,942
Scott: I can get to Fort Tryon.

1118
01:01:16,123 --> 01:01:16,484
Rym: No, yeah.

1119
01:01:16,504 --> 01:01:17,648
Rym: Yeah, that's in Manhattan still.

1120
01:01:17,668 --> 01:01:18,030
Rym: then what?

1121
01:01:18,231 --> 01:01:18,713
Scott: That's a fort.

1122
01:01:19,395 --> 01:01:23,130
Rym: you're gonna you know barricade yourself in the fort with the tapestry preppers with the tapestries.

1123
01:01:23,291 --> 01:01:25,101
Rym: I've actually never gone in there and seen the tapestries.

1124
01:01:25,402 --> 01:01:26,066
Scott: You really haven't.

1125
01:01:26,247 --> 01:01:27,232
Rym: no in all these years I've never done.

1126
01:01:27,252 --> 01:01:28,318
Scott: I've been there like two or three times.

1127
01:01:28,378 --> 01:01:28,760
Scott: Oh, yeah.

1128
01:01:28,841 --> 01:01:29,786

01:01:30,650 --> 01:01:31,574
Scott: It's a nice park there too.

1131
01:01:31,895 --> 01:01:33,080
Rym: As soon as it's nice enough.

1132
01:01:33,221 --> 01:01:35,349
Rym: You mean Emily lives bike there and go in.

1133
01:01:35,853 --> 01:01:37,610
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty safe to tie your bike up outside.

1134
01:01:37,831 --> 01:01:39,277
Rym: Also, I'll carry my crazy lock between.

1135
01:01:39,297 --> 01:01:43,314
Rym: the three of us will have three locks will lock all our bikes together It's so.

1136
01:01:43,354 --> 01:01:45,830
Rym: it'll take someone a while to get through all those chairs.

1137
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:49,750
Scott: This is just a donation to see the tapestries, you know, I've never been there.

1138
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:51,704
Rym: Maybe I'll give him a donation of some kind.

1139
01:01:51,986 --> 01:01:55,110
Rym: Yeah You had anything else you wanted to say about preppers?

1140
01:01:55,350 --> 01:01:57,840
Scott: No, I just that was the only idea I had those remotely viable.

1141
01:01:57,860 --> 01:01:57,960
Rym: cuz.

1142
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,470
Rym: I basically don't prepare for anything except by having money.

1143
01:02:00,972 --> 01:02:03,805
Rym: Yep, but I do do common sense preparation.

1144
01:02:03,885 --> 01:02:04,950
Scott: money can't save you you're fucked.

1145
01:02:05,032 --> 01:02:05,688
Scott: Anyway, whatever.

1146
01:02:05,974 --> 01:02:17,303
Rym: but like I said If a serious storm is coming and I'm not evacuating like hurricanes coming to New York and I'm not Evacuation zone so everyone else in this

1147
01:02:17,383 --> 01:02:25,350
Scott: area if you look at them If you look at like the flooding map because I mean, I'm pretty close to the water right the East River Actually my it's like across the street.

1148
01:02:25,811 --> 01:02:30,767
Scott: It's like a not so good flooding but like my apartment building like I.

1149
01:02:30,787 --> 01:02:38,930
Rym: yeah My block is literally the go here if shit goes south like situation, but I'm just like one zoned different.

1150
01:02:38,990 --> 01:02:40,422
Scott: They're like in an ocean flood zone.

1151
01:02:40,724 --> 01:02:44,165
Rym: I'm gonna like me Reasonable preparation if there is.

1152
01:02:44,226 --> 01:02:54,000
Scott: also I'm on the third floor so I kind of hope that if there is a flood that it reaches the third floor because then I can just like get a Rowboat outside my you know balcony and start moving around.

1153
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,305
Rym: You're gonna even have a rowboat.
