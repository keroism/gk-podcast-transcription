1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,525
Rym: It's Tuesday July 19th 2016.

2
00:00:10,525 --> 00:00:16,540
Rym: I'm Rym I'm coughing and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:16,761 --> 00:00:18,288
Rym: We're talking about Ekans.

4
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:19,193
Scott: We don't need it.

5
00:00:19,334 --> 00:00:20,338
Rym: We're talking about Pokemon go.

6
00:00:22,341 --> 00:00:23,358
Rym: Let's do this.

7
00:00:25,802 --> 00:00:26,990
Rym: So yeah, we're finally back.

8
00:00:27,372 --> 00:00:28,640
Rym: you guys know we were in ConnectiCon.

9
00:00:28,821 --> 00:00:30,070
Rym: we're the heads of the panels department.

10
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,025
Rym: that all went fine and We all got sick.

11
00:00:33,225 --> 00:00:41,219
Rym: Well at least me and Scott and Emily got sick, and you know some kinds of sicknesses like When I followed all the protocols of not shaking hands.

12
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,334
Rym: I fucking didn't touch anyone.

13
00:00:43,394 --> 00:00:44,140
Scott: it hand wash.

14
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:49,580
Rym: I wash my hands every time I walk past that bathroom by panel ops, and I use the alcohol disinfectant.

15
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:51,900
Scott: I don't use the disinfectant, but I wash my hands like crazy.

16
00:00:52,101 --> 00:00:53,368
Rym: Yep, but it didn't matter.

17
00:00:53,408 --> 00:00:55,540
Rym: now it appears that we actually got different things.

18
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,188
Scott: I don't like the way that shit makes your hands feel.

19
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,579
Rym: yeah, no no cuz it's all like gooey and jelly.

20
00:00:59,599 --> 00:01:00,645
Scott: yeah No, I don't like that shit.

21
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:01,933
Scott: Yeah, but at least it was.

22
00:01:02,013 --> 00:01:03,220
Rym: at least it was the real shit.

23
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,084
Rym: It was alcohol.

24
00:01:04,123 --> 00:01:07,400
Rym: It wasn't like trickles and just like came from operation Hammond.

25
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:18,159
Rym: Real guys term busters, but I guess Scott got strep throat And I just got this like ridiculous fucking cold that migrated into my eye at one point.

26
00:01:18,179 --> 00:01:19,716
Scott: Oh, yeah Wait I didn't get the eye thing.

27
00:01:19,736 --> 00:01:21,308
Rym: yeah I called my I called my insurance.

28
00:01:21,328 --> 00:01:23,240
Rym: cuz they have this like nurse you can call and ask questions.

29
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:34,440
Rym: And I was like so I'm an adult and I think I just got pink eye from myself And she was like you have a cold and I'm like yep, and then she's like were you coughing violently?

30
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:41,319
Rym: I was like yep, and she was like you probably coughed it into your eye And I was like that's a thing and she's like that is most definitely a thing.

31
00:01:42,422 --> 00:01:50,540
Rym: So yeah pink eye is super contagious if you get it like Eyeword like you get it in your eye from like some kid who didn't wash his hands after poke your eye out kid yep.

32
00:01:51,142 --> 00:01:59,139
Rym: But if you have a cold you can cough so hard that you knock it into the back of your eye And you'll basically just get pink eye from yourself.

33
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:09,680
Rym: so uh Normally like when I get sick with like a flu or something like that one katsu kann long ago Like we'll power through and like do a show or like do a thing especially at a convention.

34
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,923
Rym: But both of we ended up having illnesses that caused Constant coughing.

35
00:02:15,545 --> 00:02:21,900
Rym: so even if our mind was sound the body could not do GeekNights nor could I even do any patreon stuff?

36
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,615
Rym: So we're basically just dead in the water.

37
00:02:23,838 --> 00:02:24,682
Scott: also I wasn't even here.

38
00:02:24,742 --> 00:02:32,190
Scott: I stick because I woke up in Connecticut Monday morning planning to take the train to the city directly to work But I was sick, so I just stayed in Connecticut.

39
00:02:32,231 --> 00:02:34,340
Scott: Yeah, can't do a podcast from a state away.

40
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:40,650
Rym: I'm at work on Monday and Scott messages me, and he's like you motherfucker I got me sick, and I was like wasn't me bro.

41
00:02:41,515 --> 00:02:42,419
Rym: I got a different sick.

42
00:02:42,721 --> 00:02:43,772
Scott: Well, we all got say whatever.

43
00:02:43,812 --> 00:02:44,499
Rym: so we're finally back.

44
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:50,487
Rym: There's gonna be a lot of coughing in this episode probably and I'm not gonna edit that out cuz my cough is like 25% of what it was yesterday.

45
00:02:50,668 --> 00:02:51,572
Rym: yeah, no you.

46
00:02:51,873 --> 00:02:53,118
Rym: so Emily saw cuz.

47
00:02:53,360 --> 00:03:05,214
Rym: well I thought I was feeling better like I didn't think I was sick anymore on Wednesday, so I'm playing some overwatch right and Suddenly like the game's getting intense and I start to say some stuff on the chat And then I just had this ridiculous coughing fit.

48
00:03:05,696 --> 00:03:10,577
Rym: so bad That one of our friends on the voice chat in the game was like Rym you afk.

49
00:03:10,597 --> 00:03:11,019
Rym: What's up?

50
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,865
Rym: Cuz I just wasn't moving.

51
00:03:12,905 --> 00:03:15,578
Rym: I was like flailing and coughing coughing more now that I'm talking.

52
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:17,744
Rym: yep That's how that'll go.

53
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:18,707
Rym: you want to cough drop.

54
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:19,751
Rym: No now.

55
00:03:20,011 --> 00:03:24,146
Rym: I think we have some Emily's coughing out there, too Offing on the dinner the only.

56
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:28,540
Rym: well, I don't think I can get what Emily has cuz I'm pretty sure it's what I had.

57
00:03:29,761 --> 00:03:42,160
Rym: But at least the party we went to over the weekend was chill times in the summer outside, so I feel pretty good rejuvenated and healing wave unrelatedly But kind of related because it's kind of funny.

58
00:03:42,602 --> 00:03:50,157
Rym: I promise we're not talking about American politics or any nonsense but the bad parties conventions going on right now in America.

59
00:03:50,177 --> 00:03:52,646
Rym: and Something really funny happened.

60
00:03:53,308 --> 00:04:02,948
Rym: the the attendees of the Republican convention, which is like Literally the opposite of the nerd convention that we just ran Might have a norovirus outbreak.

61
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:03,189
Rym: well.

62
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:06,039
Scott: They're all old people so their health is not the greatest.

63
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,177
Rym: now It's funny cuz on one hand is easy for disease to spread.

64
00:04:09,197 --> 00:04:17,973
Rym: yep But nerd conventions are known for disease spreading because like a lot more people there And there's the churn like that's why Convention Center escalators always fail.

65
00:04:17,993 --> 00:04:23,900
Rym: because nerds don't just walk into a room Sit there for four hours And then go out drinking in like shitty hotel bars.

66
00:04:24,262 --> 00:04:27,218
Rym: nerds are going up and down and up and down walking around constantly.

67
00:04:27,278 --> 00:04:28,609
Rym: tell the Conventions.

68
00:04:28,649 --> 00:04:33,940
Scott: if you look at them on TV They don't look like tech conferences where it's like a bunch of chairs and people sitting quietly.

69
00:04:34,021 --> 00:04:36,999
Scott: It's a bunch of people standing all crammed in next to each other tightly.

70
00:04:37,261 --> 00:04:41,580
Scott: Yeah, right push it open and yelling and I realize this and coughing on each other.

71
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:46,920
Rym: It's a political convention, which means it's not just that they're full of flecks of spittle all over their faces.

72
00:04:47,282 --> 00:04:48,289
Rym: What a politicians do?

73
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:49,639
Rym: kiss babies and shake hands.

74
00:04:50,302 --> 00:04:51,006
Rym: They're walking around.

75
00:04:51,046 --> 00:05:09,705
Rym: this thing touching so much is so much handshaking going on there I there's a rumor that I can't confirm yet that Maybe 100% of California's delegation has norovirus, and if you don't know what norovirus is Republicans in California, there's at least two or three I assume Someone else.

76
00:05:09,745 --> 00:05:13,040
Rym: it was something funny because there was an uproar like there's some political nonsense going on.

77
00:05:13,421 --> 00:05:32,629
Rym: so a whole bunch of delegates walked out of a vote like all this like drama happened and Someone pointed out that the tweet from the news that said the Colorado delegation has abandoned the convention Was that exactly 4 20 p.m Oh That is the extent of the politics we'll get tonight.

78
00:05:32,649 --> 00:05:34,416
Rym: we're back we're bad we're doing GeekNights.

79
00:05:34,717 --> 00:05:35,299
Rym: got any news?

80
00:05:36,225 --> 00:05:46,232
Scott: I do have a news the long-awaited Radio ball and a grim dark future when all he was released to the world Like a week or two ago.

81
00:05:46,252 --> 00:05:47,359
Rym: Have you played it yet?

82
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:56,914
Scott: I bought it immediately and have not even launched it or installed it because I have not been home and not sick and At a time when I'm gonna play some video ball.

83
00:05:56,975 --> 00:05:58,722
Rym: even at a time like this We've been.

84
00:05:58,963 --> 00:06:00,909
Scott: why don't you really game in the winter?

85
00:06:00,969 --> 00:06:04,620
Scott: Why would you release your game in the warmest most beautiful time of the year?

86
00:06:04,901 --> 00:06:06,670
Rym: I mean, we've been talking about this game for what?

87
00:06:06,751 --> 00:06:11,253
Rym: almost three years every packs We go up to these guys and you were like just give me the game like.

88
00:06:11,313 --> 00:06:14,473
Rym: I don't just forgive me the game I want the game also.

89
00:06:14,534 --> 00:06:25,535
Scott: at a time It just so happens even though I'm ready to play video ball everyone that I would play video ball with is over Playing overwatch and Pokemon go and I even if I played video ball.

90
00:06:25,595 --> 00:06:27,887
Scott: No one else is video balling now Luckily there.

91
00:06:27,907 --> 00:06:29,440
Rym: It's not a fully transitive situation.

92
00:06:29,761 --> 00:06:33,272
Rym: You can play Pokemon go and video ball at the same time.

93
00:06:33,313 --> 00:06:35,520
Rym: you play Pokemon Pokemon goal and overwatch at the same time.

94
00:06:35,761 --> 00:06:48,399
Rym: You cannot play overwatch and video ball at the same time especially because the competitive season started and The let's just say the level of overwatch play is rising rapidly.

95
00:06:49,681 --> 00:06:53,074
Rym: I'm holding on to my 51 rank with grim determination.

96
00:06:53,214 --> 00:06:54,479
Scott: I'll be started on video ball.

97
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:00,420
Rym: Soonish I will install video ball and play it before the end of this week.

98
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:04,360
Scott: I think at the very least right even if video ball doesn't take off to be internet competitive.

99
00:07:04,721 --> 00:07:10,619
Scott: You know thing that it will at least become the best like everyone's in the same room at the party game.

100
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,608
Rym: Oh hell yeah, in fact, it's Scott.

101
00:07:12,648 --> 00:07:13,412
Rym: It's kind of good.

102
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:13,814
Scott: It's like.

103
00:07:13,895 --> 00:07:17,700
Scott: take that, you know It's like we'll have another option besides Bomberman.

104
00:07:17,781 --> 00:07:19,151
Scott: Well Bomberman and video ball.

105
00:07:19,191 --> 00:07:23,674
Rym: when rocket league came out Half of our friends played enough to get pretty good and the other half didn't.

106
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:25,522
Scott: but it sucks to play rocket league in the same Room.

107
00:07:25,542 --> 00:07:28,740
Scott: Yeah, well, we had it also hard, you know, it's hard people to play.

108
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,808
Rym: We did it at the New Year's party But that's because we had like seven computers.

109
00:07:31,848 --> 00:07:33,978
Scott: that also sucks to have like a split-screen time.

110
00:07:33,998 --> 00:07:34,500
Rym: I didn't have that.

111
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,547
Rym: I was playing my laptop.

112
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:36,171
Scott: It's still.

113
00:07:36,272 --> 00:07:37,379
Scott: it's not but it's not the best.

114
00:07:37,661 --> 00:07:44,980
Rym: But the other problem was you know people got good at different rates and overwatch While it's fun to play with friends competitive kind of split off on its own both a video ball.

115
00:07:45,861 --> 00:07:58,600
Rym: If our friends don't play it that much it means every time we're together We bust it out and much like star wall Nobody's good enough to where no one wants to play Street Fighter or Soul Calibur with Jess or Scott anymore.

116
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:05,038
Scott: Well, there are also times when even if everyone plays the game the same amount some people progress and skill more quickly than others.

117
00:08:05,158 --> 00:08:12,020
Rym: Yeah Yeah, anyway, I am excited though I mean, I've been waiting for video ball for a long time and it's gonna scratch an itch.

118
00:08:12,141 --> 00:08:13,332
Rym: I know it's gonna scratch an itch.

119
00:08:13,635 --> 00:08:15,747
Scott: It's the other game We've been waiting for which we talked about.

120
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:20,750
Scott: last episode the Valhalla is out - we still haven't played that The cyberpunk bartending simulator.

121
00:08:20,871 --> 00:08:27,400
Rym: I installed it on my laptop And I was gonna play it on the way to the party this weekend because I was still a little sick.

122
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,690
Rym: I just fell asleep instead and then the Prince of Nothing book came out.

123
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,916
Scott: So that's replacing all portable gaming.

124
00:08:32,957 --> 00:08:34,059
Scott: is reading books instead?

125
00:08:34,221 --> 00:08:36,339
Scott: Yeah, oh by the way, I finished reading the book club book.

126
00:08:36,621 --> 00:08:38,594
Rym: I was about to finish reading the book club book.

127
00:08:38,614 --> 00:08:43,679
Rym: Wait for some meta moment And then I read the first 60% of the Prince of Nothing book.

128
00:08:44,283 --> 00:08:47,560
Rym: I feel like I'm gonna finish the Prince of Nothing book, but I'll probably finish Orcs and Craig this weekend.

129
00:08:48,002 --> 00:08:50,473
Scott: Mmm, took me five or six hours to read it.

130
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:51,257
Rym: Not bad.

131
00:08:51,377 --> 00:08:51,699
Rym: Not bad.

132
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:55,220
Rym: My Kindle says there's only two hours left in the Prince of Nothing book.

133
00:08:55,762 --> 00:08:59,358
Scott: I was surprised at looking at the percentage at the bottom of the Prince of Nothing.

134
00:08:59,418 --> 00:09:01,686
Scott: as I read it I'm like really 30% already.

135
00:09:01,706 --> 00:09:07,205
Rym: we ready for this because I hit the whale mothers and then I looked at the percent and I was like Whoa, whoa, okay.

136
00:09:07,787 --> 00:09:09,795
Rym: Well, I know about whale mothers.

137
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:11,020
Rym: There's not that much book left.

138
00:09:11,221 --> 00:09:12,971
Scott: I think I'm in the whale mother chapter right now.

139
00:09:13,132 --> 00:09:14,540
Rym: Yeah, but you don't know what the whale mothers are yet.

140
00:09:15,523 --> 00:09:22,000
Rym: Oh if men bred themselves the way men breed cattle, yes, it's bad stuff.

141
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,806
Rym: This book is peak our Scott Packard.

142
00:09:24,227 --> 00:09:28,420
Rym: Yeah, but why did everything we like come out literally like in the span of a few weeks?

143
00:09:29,022 --> 00:09:30,650
Scott: Everyone got their shit done in August.

144
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:30,891
Rym: Yeah.

145
00:09:30,911 --> 00:09:33,462
Rym: No get your line in February That's right.

146
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:38,740
Rym: If we make a convention which we're talking about it's gonna be like middle of February on the worst.

147
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,750
Scott: It's gonna be sometime fucking cold.

148
00:09:40,951 --> 00:09:41,212
Rym: Yep.

149
00:09:41,453 --> 00:09:42,880
Rym: It's gonna be cold and miserable.

150
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:46,239
Rym: There'll be nothing going on that weekend to trust us.

151
00:09:47,325 --> 00:09:48,157
Rym: so in my news.

152
00:09:49,661 --> 00:09:54,240
Rym: Scott might make fun of me a little because my news is yet again overwatch, but the new patch came out.

153
00:09:54,321 --> 00:09:55,999
Scott: You'll get over it soon enough.

154
00:09:56,019 --> 00:09:58,975
Rym: Uh I'm still not over weapons factory.

155
00:09:59,156 --> 00:10:06,995
Rym: you realize I'm still not over tribes Like if tribes were easy to play like like this game is.

156
00:10:07,015 --> 00:10:10,048
Rym: I just play tribes every day Like I've been maybe even quick GeekNights.

157
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:12,280
Rym: to be a I'd wander the world's game of jet packs.

158
00:10:12,981 --> 00:10:17,700
Scott: There's a character Farah, but not everyone not everyone and there's that spin fuse ores.

159
00:10:18,444 --> 00:10:20,053
Scott: Uh doesn't have all that crazy shit.

160
00:10:20,073 --> 00:10:26,863
Rym: You can set up in your base Symmetra kinda Not quite to that extent but symmetric and make teleporters You can get.

161
00:10:26,883 --> 00:10:32,512
Scott: you can equip yourself every time you spawn with all And it's all the vehicles and everyone gets in the vehicle.

162
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:33,716
Rym: Can't do any of that.

163
00:10:33,796 --> 00:10:34,820
Scott: The map is ginormous.

164
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,423
Rym: That's what I'm saying.

165
00:10:35,463 --> 00:10:40,869
Rym: It doesn't fully scratch the tribes eating but holy hell Does it scratch the weapons factory?

166
00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:43,000
Rym: old team fortress mega TF itch?

167
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:53,880
Rym: I play this game every goddamn day but a new patch just hit and The internet was going crazy about it and you might have seen me arguing with a lot of different people about the patch.

168
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:56,820
Rym: But the patch is interesting for a number of reasons.

169
00:10:57,141 --> 00:11:05,809
Rym: so I'm gonna read the patch notes because one thing you should know Scott and I were talking before the show one thing blizzards real good about is There's like this twofold balance on the one hand.

170
00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:08,640
Rym: They don't listen to you when you complain to them.

171
00:11:09,665 --> 00:11:10,449
Scott: Actually a little bit.

172
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:12,480
Scott: Well the hearthstone people seem to be listening.

173
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,564
Scott: They listen somewhat.

174
00:11:13,824 --> 00:11:20,397
Rym: they listen in the sense of they see people who are mad and they look at the game and say oh There's a problem there Let's fix it.

175
00:11:20,742 --> 00:11:23,039
Rym: But they don't listen to you in their lot when you're like.

176
00:11:23,562 --> 00:11:27,660
Rym: You should add another kind of card called this and let us make mods of the game.

177
00:11:28,222 --> 00:11:29,507
Scott: No, and they're definitely not letting.

178
00:11:29,527 --> 00:11:30,832
Scott: they never let anyone mod anything.

179
00:11:30,852 --> 00:11:31,133
Scott: blizzard.

180
00:11:31,153 --> 00:11:32,840
Scott: blizzard is the most anti mod, right?

181
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,580
Scott: They go after anyone who sets up their own server.

182
00:11:35,681 --> 00:11:37,907
Rym: And I'm telling you I used to be super pro mod.

183
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:47,014
Rym: the only reason I am NOT anymore is because of tribes - But the other thing is that blizzard when they do make changes I'm pro.

184
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:55,194
Scott: I'm pro mod in terms of the kind of mod where it's like we made this brand new game using your engine Right without having to buy your stupid engine like counter-strike.

185
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,141
Scott: But I'm not pro mod Like.

186
00:11:58,161 --> 00:12:02,280
Scott: we made a different counter-strike get zombie counter-strike and now half the people are playing zombie counter-strike.

187
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:08,960
Rym: The worst thing about your example, is that zombie counter-strike was almost fun like it was probably the best of those.

188
00:12:09,241 --> 00:12:12,500
Rym: Did you ever play World of Warcraft counter-strike?

189
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,567
Scott: I'm also pro mod in terms of like.

190
00:12:14,587 --> 00:12:22,680
Rym: hey, let me make a custom map for this game like FYI swirled Yep, or sieve five like let's just make the entire Prince of Nothing world into a scenario.

191
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,363
Rym: I was my.

192
00:12:23,383 --> 00:12:24,246
Scott: that was my idea.

193
00:12:24,267 --> 00:12:25,230
Rym: It was we.

194
00:12:25,371 --> 00:12:27,540
Scott: uh, we're just as long as you admit that it was my idea.

195
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,086
Rym: I should just post that chat you had.

196
00:12:29,267 --> 00:12:31,557
Rym: uh, was it your idea or did I incept it into you?

197
00:12:31,597 --> 00:12:32,220
Rym: What came before?

198
00:12:32,802 --> 00:12:33,445
Scott: I came before.

199
00:12:33,465 --> 00:12:36,158
Rym: Well, actually we have a chat log and you'll see exactly what came before.

200
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:36,640
Scott: Yeah me.

201
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,407
Rym: But so the one thing is there here's.

202
00:12:40,447 --> 00:12:43,300
Rym: I'm gonna read some of these change notes because blizzard goes into a lot of detail.

203
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:57,390
Rym: If a match goes into overtime for more than 20 seconds, the overtime fuse will now burn down much more quickly Mmm, so if a match doesn't end definitively at the end of its time it goes into overtime.

204
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:00,681
Rym: the way over time basically works is they'll be like an objective of some Kind.

205
00:13:01,182 --> 00:13:05,494
Rym: so like one example is there's a payload that is to get to a destination by a time.

206
00:13:06,135 --> 00:13:15,468
Rym: if the time runs out and the Payload is not yet at the destination the people pushing the payload lose, but the payload is still moving Because the the attackers are still on it.

207
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:24,974
Rym: then over time starts and as long as they stay on the payload The overtime goes on forever, but the moment they're off the payload.

208
00:13:25,174 --> 00:13:26,899
Rym: There's this cow overtime fuse that just goes.

209
00:13:28,824 --> 00:13:30,027
Scott: So it's 20 seconds, right.

210
00:13:30,047 --> 00:13:31,110
Scott: so it basically allows you.

211
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:36,206
Rym: if like well, no, it's 20 seconds from the point you are not Advancing it any further.

212
00:13:36,226 --> 00:13:39,720
Scott: Right, but I'm saying it's like it's basically allows for the buzzer beater situation.

213
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,068
Scott: We're like, we almost made it.

214
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:43,000
Scott: We don't want to just get cut off like you're one.

215
00:13:43,901 --> 00:13:56,680
Rym: You could spend the whole match at the beginning of them of the thing Like you're like way away from the objective hit overtime And if you just never get knocked off of that thing, you'll eventually take it over the finish line in a win.

216
00:13:57,442 --> 00:14:12,224
Rym: It works great But what they're doing is if they over time goes on for more than 20 seconds total The fuse that determines whether or not it can keep going will start burning down faster and faster and faster to force a conclusion which is good because The ice.

217
00:14:12,244 --> 00:14:27,046
Rym: I saw some players and I did this a few times who had strategies that Involved getting into overtime and delaying the game for a very long time like six mays can't lose a Competitive play.

218
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:28,134
Rym: Oh, oh.

219
00:14:28,174 --> 00:14:31,588
Rym: and also in overtime Respawn times are increased.

220
00:14:31,969 --> 00:14:32,612
Scott: Yeah, that makes sense.

221
00:14:32,652 --> 00:14:33,455
Rym: So think about this.

222
00:14:33,495 --> 00:14:36,004
Rym: That means in overtime It kills someone.

223
00:14:36,104 --> 00:14:36,947
Scott: you're gonna win like.

224
00:14:36,987 --> 00:14:38,011
Rym: that's a big deal.

225
00:14:38,071 --> 00:14:40,619
Rym: killing someone matters a lot surviving matters a lot.

226
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,241
Scott: Sure That's good.

227
00:14:41,522 --> 00:14:51,043
Rym: The change that everyone's bitching about is and I was bitching too, and I'm very Conflicted and ambivalent on the change in competitive play Matches.

228
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:54,080
Rym: you can only have one of each hero per team.

229
00:14:54,962 --> 00:15:04,504
Rym: So that would be like if in weapons factory you could only have on your team one sniper one engineer one arsonist one Whatever.

230
00:15:04,585 --> 00:15:06,814
Rym: healer nurse nurse was the class.

231
00:15:07,818 --> 00:15:24,440
Rym: and on one hand I don't like that because I do enjoy the strategies people came up with like in certain maps just have two sentry turrets fucking go Nuts, but on the other hand I can see that if you allow Heroes to be doubled up because every hero has like a crazy dune style power.

232
00:15:25,082 --> 00:15:37,711
Rym: Then if you make one hero a little bit too strong in a certain situation You could theoretically have a degenerate strategy in certain maps of yeah Just fucking send six Winston's in and nothing beats that but six maze.

233
00:15:37,731 --> 00:15:41,340
Scott: I mean limiting options is usually good, right?

234
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:45,119
Rym: It's like, you know Well, it's good for balance.

235
00:15:45,461 --> 00:15:53,680
Scott: If you think of like the set of players you have on the set of classes you choose on an FPS team as Like the cards in a in a collectible card game.

236
00:15:54,142 --> 00:15:58,620
Scott: It's like you can't just let someone make a deck of like eight lightning bolts and then turn it into a deck of eight.

237
00:15:58,821 --> 00:16:01,393
Scott: You know restore health or whatever right when they need health.

238
00:16:01,453 --> 00:16:02,900
Scott: It's like that's you know, it's bullshit, right?

239
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,240
Scott: It's like yeah choose one of everything, you know at any given time.

240
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,960
Scott: I'm surprised they didn't actually take it further and do the thing the mobas do or you deny.

241
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:12,886
Scott: And it's only.

242
00:16:13,167 --> 00:16:21,180
Scott: it's like if someone when you pick something you're that for the whole game and Only one person and as soon as one team takes a class the other team can't pick it.

243
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:21,602
Scott: You know what?

244
00:16:21,642 --> 00:16:25,760
Rym: They appear to have been floating some of those ideas, but honestly I don't ruin the game.

245
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:31,865
Scott: I think it works in mobas because they have so many classes that if someone like takes one support There's always another support you can get.

246
00:16:31,886 --> 00:16:38,715
Scott: it's not like they can ever ban you from getting any healers whatsoever unless you really mess It up, but I don't think overwatch while it has a lot.

247
00:16:38,755 --> 00:16:39,780
Scott: It doesn't have enough yet.

248
00:16:40,241 --> 00:16:47,467
Rym: Also overwatch is more like make your team of six with your strategy for those six people Irrespective of the other side.

249
00:16:47,528 --> 00:16:50,580
Rym: It's more like hockey and less like a MOBA in that regard.

250
00:16:50,903 --> 00:16:52,640
Rym: Like this is my team as your team.

251
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:55,260
Scott: No, like counter picking like ah, they picked that person.

252
00:16:55,401 --> 00:16:56,204
Scott: So we need to pick this.

253
00:16:56,545 --> 00:16:59,960
Rym: in fact, you can't see who they pick until you see them in game.

254
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:05,762
Scott: Well, they could let you see right they can let you see, you know They could if they built the MOBA like character selection system They would like.

255
00:17:05,801 --> 00:17:14,068
Rym: I'm saying right now you can't right but what it means is, you know to use the hockey analogy Because you can change characters during the match Like yeah, that's another thing as he can't do.

256
00:17:14,127 --> 00:17:19,026
Rym: that is great because that is like a hockey line change Yeah, and it works really well.

257
00:17:19,608 --> 00:17:21,776
Rym: So I'm really ambivalent on the change.

258
00:17:22,478 --> 00:17:24,526
Rym: I Suspect in the end.

259
00:17:24,546 --> 00:17:28,480
Rym: now they gave some additional notes as to why they made the change and the chain.

260
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,040
Scott: I'll just make the game more interesting.

261
00:17:30,434 --> 00:17:31,363
Rym: Yeah It does so.

262
00:17:32,046 --> 00:17:33,351
Rym: the here's the pros and cons.

263
00:17:33,391 --> 00:17:35,660
Rym: the pros of the change seem to be one.

264
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,421
Rym: It's easier to balance heroes Like.

265
00:17:37,441 --> 00:17:42,760
Rym: they can try crazy stuff with a hero and they can test it much more easily for balance, right?

266
00:17:42,881 --> 00:17:45,103
Scott: If there's some ridiculously powerful hero That's like Opie.

267
00:17:45,343 --> 00:17:50,540
Scott: each team will have one at most and that's it and you can balance around that and you won't have these boring games.

268
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,948
Scott: So it's like oh we made a hero Opie.

269
00:17:52,008 --> 00:17:53,798
Scott: Both teams are six of the same here all the time.

270
00:17:53,818 --> 00:17:56,335
Scott: Oops You know, you just save yourself from that.

271
00:17:56,618 --> 00:18:06,993
Rym: Yep But the main complaint seemed to be that competitive players are whiny little babies who are complaining That it was really hard to counter certain strategies on certain maps.

272
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:09,040
Rym: they didn't appear to be completely degenerate.

273
00:18:09,441 --> 00:18:11,328
Rym: It's just baby's got to get good.

274
00:18:11,769 --> 00:18:14,900
Scott: Well also, yeah, it's hard to counter certain strategies in certain maps.

275
00:18:15,021 --> 00:18:22,411
Scott: But now those other people can't use those strategies because they also have to have six unique heroes Yep, and they can't come at you with six of the same guy.

276
00:18:22,451 --> 00:18:24,640
Scott: You don't need six of the other guy to stop them.

277
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,126
Scott: They only have.

278
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:29,740
Rym: you know, it's like come on But like there were some maps word, but then here's there's my counterpoint on the other side.

279
00:18:30,322 --> 00:18:49,928
Rym: When this wasn't a thing especially in casual play you'd see these amazing spectator moments Where the crazy bullshit goes down like a team's losing and losing and suddenly they just kind of get desperate and six winstons just burst onto the scene and go crazy go literally apeshit and It was real fun.

280
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:52,700
Rym: It's like when the crazy crap like the onside kick nonsense happens.

281
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,932
Scott: Yeah, that's why this rules only in competitive mode.

282
00:18:54,972 --> 00:18:56,118
Scott: Hearthstone did the same thing.

283
00:18:56,159 --> 00:18:56,380
Scott: Hearthstone.

284
00:18:56,541 --> 00:19:02,894
Scott: They have you know, they have competitive mode, which is like standard mode and they also have wild mode Which is like play all the crazy cards.

285
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:07,051
Rym: Whoo Now I do think I suspect.

286
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:19,792
Rym: now again, I do not know the math I don't have any of the stats that Blizzard has I Suspect they could have gotten away with doing actually the thing that weapons factory did back in the day Cuz weapons factory the most recent game.

287
00:19:19,813 --> 00:19:25,460
Rym: that's like this game And what they did is all the people who ran servers sort of converged upon.

288
00:19:26,122 --> 00:19:30,336
Rym: So certain classes were limited to a limited number and others weren't.

289
00:19:30,496 --> 00:19:31,600
Scott: yeah another way of doing this.

290
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:40,720
Scott: That's just too complicated for real-time Switching is just use a points based system Like each class is worth X points and your team can only have X points on the field at a time.

291
00:19:41,021 --> 00:19:42,347
Scott: But it's like imagine respawning.

292
00:19:42,387 --> 00:19:43,552
Scott: I mean, I have to choose a class.

293
00:19:43,973 --> 00:19:45,500
Scott: There's only 20 points available.

294
00:19:45,801 --> 00:19:51,880
Scott: I want a class that cost 22. could someone else die and respond to something that cost to last so I can switch to the?

295
00:19:52,101 --> 00:19:52,968
Scott: You know, it's like that.

296
00:19:53,089 --> 00:19:54,400
Scott: it's like fuck that nonsense, right?

297
00:19:55,322 --> 00:19:57,940
Scott: But yeah, but that's a good system other than that obvious problem.

298
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:02,000
Scott: If you were if you were like planning at the start of the game like building a miniature, you know, then it would be fine.

299
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:03,360
Rym: Yep, but I remember weapons back.

300
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,245
Rym: I remember the full details just been so long.

301
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:16,600
Rym: but like Gunner was like Bastion is an overwatch and most servers said only two Gunners Only two engineers because like six turrets in a room in a 10v10 was just unbeatable.

302
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,526
Rym: So they do that sort of thing.

303
00:20:19,448 --> 00:20:21,575
Rym: I hope in the in the long run.

304
00:20:22,156 --> 00:20:23,340
Rym: That's what ends up happening.

305
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:28,302
Rym: I'd like to see a little bit of hero stacking because it really adds to the strategic depth I think.

306
00:20:28,322 --> 00:20:31,860
Scott: I think that all they really need to do to solve that is to just do like I said with the MOBAs.

307
00:20:32,021 --> 00:20:35,640
Rym: Right, if you want it, for example, I do not want to see a lot of heroes in this game.

308
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,560
Rym: Like I don't want is I was gonna be a lot of heroes.

309
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,532
Rym: Hey, I don't think they'll be hundreds cuz they're going real.

310
00:20:39,633 --> 00:20:40,760
Scott: I don't know if they'll be hundreds.

311
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:45,440
Scott: But for example, like you want more engineers right that because you want more than one turret, right?

312
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:45,962
Scott: So they'll just.

313
00:20:45,982 --> 00:20:47,269
Rym: they already have two kinds of turrets.

314
00:20:47,571 --> 00:20:54,345
Scott: I'm just saying they'll make a Yet another class that has some kind of engineer, you know, that's different than the other ones But still right.

315
00:20:54,365 --> 00:20:56,520
Scott: and that's how you would get to stacking, right?

316
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:03,105
Rym: I just don't think they'll add too many heroes over time partly because the game in all games they've had so far they've kept adding heroes.

317
00:21:03,206 --> 00:21:12,033
Rym: true, but this is a very different kind of game because of the player skill input and Unlike those MOBAs even the Pareto frontier in this game is fucking tight.

318
00:21:12,614 --> 00:21:14,700
Scott: I sure but I'm saying expect new heroes.

319
00:21:14,801 --> 00:21:17,439
Rym: Oh, yeah, but they're the rate of hero adding.

320
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,998
Scott: Expect multiple heroes multiple heroes per year.

321
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,367
Rym: Well, well, I don't know.

322
00:21:23,387 --> 00:21:24,694
Rym: I don't think it'll be multiple per year.

323
00:21:24,754 --> 00:21:25,760
Scott: It'll be multiple per year.

324
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,688
Rym: I may be at most two a year.

325
00:21:28,009 --> 00:21:29,596
Scott: No, it's gonna be way more to be at least five.

326
00:21:29,616 --> 00:21:30,279
Rym: I don't know.

327
00:21:31,441 --> 00:21:32,006
Rym: We'll see.

328
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:32,954
Scott: that's how they do.

329
00:21:32,974 --> 00:21:38,599
Rym: in the very least They'll never charge you for heroes But if they do it if they do it a lot of charging 50 bucks for the game So they better fucking not charge it.

330
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:45,699
Rym: The problem will be if they had too many heroes the game will turn into a MOBA where that knowledge matrix starts to matter a lot.

331
00:21:45,719 --> 00:21:55,212
Rym: and Also, it means that teams tactical composition changes are so much more subtle and less obvious to spectators that the game will basically turn into A MOBA and I'd quit playing it.

332
00:21:55,252 --> 00:21:55,799
Scott: That's how they do.

333
00:21:56,101 --> 00:21:57,229
Rym: Yeah, and if that happens, I'll quit.

334
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:59,021
Rym: but it's not doesn't appear to be happening Now.

335
00:21:59,442 --> 00:22:03,496
Rym: the player the characters are all all true dick and super skill based.

336
00:22:03,516 --> 00:22:04,600
Rym: There's a whole bunch of other changes

337
00:22:05,102 --> 00:22:15,540
Scott: But I mean it'll be slower than adding heroes to their actual MOBA because it takes a lot more work to make one For an FPS, you know all you got to make all these weapons and models and animations and stuff that you know.

338
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,467
Scott: They're bigger and they're fancier.

339
00:22:17,788 --> 00:22:21,020
Rym: I think they're gonna add more modes and more maps first.

340
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:26,510
Scott: They're definitely gonna do that for sure because also I noticed something the character they added unlike the MOBA's that I'll have like one map Right.

341
00:22:26,694 --> 00:22:30,839
Rym: Yep Well, actually I'll get into that later because we got other stuff to talk about and this will be a real long news.

342
00:22:30,859 --> 00:22:32,160
Rym: if I talk About everything else is going on here.

343
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:41,479
Rym: But the the most important change I play diva a lot Like I'm real good with diva and I stopped playing diva because it felt kind of overpowered to me And I wanted to get better at other classes.

344
00:22:42,363 --> 00:22:47,160
Rym: They just made diva way more powerful because everyone else thought that character was underpowered.

345
00:22:48,062 --> 00:22:54,740
Rym: So I'm already like real fucking dangerous with that character and now they just made her like twice as powerful.

346
00:22:55,761 --> 00:22:56,603
Rym: I'm real curious.

347
00:22:56,623 --> 00:22:58,466
Rym: What's gonna happen if I start using her again.

348
00:23:03,978 --> 00:23:07,767
Rym: So anyway things Of the day got a thing of the day.

349
00:23:07,787 --> 00:23:13,039
Scott: Yeah, some dude got some Legos and he made with those Legos a gentleman's club.

350
00:23:13,547 --> 00:23:22,586
Scott: Yeah Ricks bricks bricks all shapes and sizes and while you know a gentleman's club is in itself rather distasteful This is funny.

351
00:23:22,928 --> 00:23:24,515
Rym: It looks a lot like show palace.

352
00:23:25,017 --> 00:23:33,464
Scott: Yeah Like specifically it's quite low brow, but it has all these Lego jokes and ah, but I'm quite low brow It's it's well constructed.

353
00:23:33,825 --> 00:23:37,134
Rym: So so a multiple people sent this to me.

354
00:23:37,896 --> 00:23:39,260
Rym: This is called hyper reality.

355
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:48,700
Rym: Uh presents a provocative and kaleidoscopic new vision of the future where physical and virtual rallies emerge in a city saturated in media.

356
00:23:49,523 --> 00:23:50,948
Rym: This is basically now.

357
00:23:51,028 --> 00:23:52,955
Rym: I couldn't find it because I forgot it was called.

358
00:23:52,975 --> 00:23:54,300
Rym: I couldn't remember who showed it to me.

359
00:23:54,823 --> 00:24:14,160
Rym: so eventually I just typed into Google and I was like Dystopian augmented reality and this is literally the first thing that came up, but it is a video that's like a first-person view of a human being living in a Pretty likely future of what augmented reality is actually gonna be like in the real world.

360
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,313
Scott: But I mean we've seen stuff like this a million times before.

361
00:24:16,353 --> 00:24:17,339
Scott: what's different about this one?

362
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:18,823
Rym: I like what name one.

363
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:21,351
Scott: Well, there's like the dental coil anime.

364
00:24:21,452 --> 00:24:23,318
Rym: No coil is a lot different from this.

365
00:24:23,579 --> 00:24:29,031
Rym: Yes Superficially, here's a future where augmented reality exists.

366
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:31,859
Scott: Blade Runner every single cyberpunk thing ever.

367
00:24:32,862 --> 00:24:36,073
Rym: So Blade Runner doesn't say any of the things really that this says.

368
00:24:36,534 --> 00:24:38,669
Rym: Blade Runner also wasn't really focused on AR at all.

369
00:24:39,747 --> 00:24:40,600
Rym: Mmm Blade Runner.

370
00:24:41,842 --> 00:24:52,479
Rym: Yeah, all right Scott there are works of media that Superficially cover the same broad spectrum of just someone walking around is like ads in their face all the time.

371
00:24:53,522 --> 00:24:55,487
Rym: That is one tiny aspect of this.

372
00:24:55,948 --> 00:24:56,208
Rym: Also.

373
00:24:56,268 --> 00:25:11,130
Rym: What is very different about this is that it is very well constructed and has a deep variety of very Specific and subtle details that really drive home the Terrifying reality of this sort of future.

374
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:13,620
Rym: the moral is always block ads.

375
00:25:14,061 --> 00:25:18,093
Rym: Yeah, always always always block ads and every every aspect of your life block ads.

376
00:25:18,454 --> 00:25:19,638
Rym: hundred years block ads.

377
00:25:19,879 --> 00:25:21,491
Scott: calm You wanna play gods?

378
00:25:21,612 --> 00:25:27,940
Rym: Yeah In the moment, the booklet book is Oryx and Crick by Margaret Atwood read the whole thing.

379
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,949
Scott: It took me like five six hours tops.

380
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:33,746
Rym: I'm gonna finish the Prince of Nothing book and then this weekend I'll probably read Oryx and Crick.

381
00:25:33,806 --> 00:25:43,246
Scott: So I already picked like the next two book club books and Apparently Oryx and Crick has like two sequels and those are not the next book club picks even though it's apparently you're supposed to read Them.

382
00:25:43,494 --> 00:25:46,027
Scott: Yep I didn't even realize that that was a trilogy.

383
00:25:46,067 --> 00:25:52,972
Rym: until many of our friends when they're when they find out that we're reading this book For the book club are like, oh you got to read the other two.

384
00:25:53,154 --> 00:25:53,858
Scott: I'm like other two.

385
00:25:53,938 --> 00:25:54,240
Scott: What?

386
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,333
Scott: Even though I finished it at that point.

387
00:25:56,414 --> 00:26:03,305
Scott: I was like, oh Okay that you just turn the ending from a non cliffhanger into a cliffhanger That there was more.

388
00:26:03,867 --> 00:26:11,911
Rym: see remember the only reason I read all 14 of those Wheel of Time books plus new spring Was that I knew that series was already done.

389
00:26:11,971 --> 00:26:14,060
Rym: There'd never be any more and the original author was dead.

390
00:26:14,962 --> 00:26:15,203
Rym: I will.

391
00:26:15,303 --> 00:26:17,268
Rym: I basically don't start things that I don't trust.

392
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:20,096
Rym: might that I do not trust you end reliably.

393
00:26:20,116 --> 00:26:21,239
Scott: you're reading Prince of Nothing.

394
00:26:21,259 --> 00:26:27,715
Rym: then Based on how those books are going He knows how it's going to end and he's likely to survive to finish them.

395
00:26:27,736 --> 00:26:28,600
Rym: and there aren't that many more.

396
00:26:29,363 --> 00:26:36,572
Rym: There's gonna be way less news tomorrow if our Scott Packard dies Before the book after the one I'm reading right now comes out.

397
00:26:37,355 --> 00:26:40,170
Rym: I'm going to be distraught let us put it that way.

398
00:26:40,431 --> 00:26:47,920
Rym: but I think the the Danger of that is much lower than with say the awful Game of Thrones books that I really have zero interest in reading.

399
00:26:48,241 --> 00:26:49,245
Scott: Yeah, no fuck those.

400
00:26:49,426 --> 00:26:57,860
Rym: Yep in other news now that Connecticut is done All that content that's been kind of on hold for a long time is coming back full force.

401
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,206
Rym: Scott's gonna make a bunch of videos.

402
00:26:59,588 --> 00:27:00,753
Rym: I'm gonna make a bunch of videos.

403
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:02,340
Rym: got a ton of things for the patreon.

404
00:27:02,742 --> 00:27:05,053
Rym: I got a bunch of panels from other conventions.

405
00:27:05,133 --> 00:27:10,983
Rym: I got to upload to YouTube GeekNights presents who 10 of 15 is like 90% done.

406
00:27:11,425 --> 00:27:17,502
Rym: all this shit is a creative explosion is gonna come out dependent only upon how nice it is outside Mm-hmm.

407
00:27:18,226 --> 00:27:29,917
Rym: And also we are going to be officially Appearing live at PAX West not PAX prime West 2016 on a prime and a living in capstone at the end getting help from physical plant physical plant.

408
00:27:29,937 --> 00:27:32,071
Rym: and I'm using my fire My Phoenix browser.

409
00:27:32,091 --> 00:27:37,059
Scott: Yeah I'm gonna play some tennis on my Nintendo revolution.

410
00:27:41,707 --> 00:27:45,971
Rym: But we are performing Saturday September 3rd at 5 p.m.

411
00:27:46,372 --> 00:27:48,820
Rym: In the chicken theater the grind.

412
00:27:49,281 --> 00:27:54,780
Rym: We're doing an hour-long lecture on the very concept of grinding in games.

413
00:27:55,165 --> 00:28:00,000
Rym: at its core It's been you know, we do a lot of panels a lot of lectures of cons.

414
00:28:00,141 --> 00:28:09,128
Rym: But I do want to say this because this one's gonna be More like panels we did many years ago in that We're excited like really excited about it.

415
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:12,178
Rym: as soon as Scott had the idea cuz he I was like, what about grinding?

416
00:28:12,198 --> 00:28:17,300
Rym: and I was like Oh, oh and then we both had already like four hours worth of shit to talk.

417
00:28:17,381 --> 00:28:20,340
Scott: So if anyone get out there, I want you to help us do some research.

418
00:28:20,521 --> 00:28:25,058
Scott: I want you to find us the earliest examples of grinding that in gaming that you can follow.

419
00:28:25,099 --> 00:28:29,113
Rym: in gaming I was about to say being a peasant right, but I mean like, you know, I found like.

420
00:28:29,133 --> 00:28:33,950
Scott: there's some old-ass RPGs obviously But like is there anything older than the oldest RPGs?

421
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:36,920
Rym: We have to level up and yeah, there's no grinding in Kriegsfield.

422
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:37,462
Scott: I mean like.

423
00:28:38,104 --> 00:28:38,887
Scott: grinding is old.

424
00:28:38,927 --> 00:28:40,894
Scott: Final Fantasy 1 was not the first.

425
00:28:41,335 --> 00:28:42,760
Rym: now you might be saying but Rym and Scott.

426
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,780
Rym: What do you mean by grinding?

427
00:28:44,721 --> 00:28:45,765
Rym: There's some wonderful threads.

428
00:28:45,785 --> 00:28:48,014
Scott: I think you can get an idea of what grinding means.

429
00:28:48,275 --> 00:28:50,247
Rym: Yeah, you can figure it out But there are a lot like.

430
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:52,000
Rym: grinding serves purposes in games.

431
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,466
Rym: This is not gonna be a lecture of.

432
00:28:53,727 --> 00:28:57,280
Rym: here's all the reasons why grinding is bad and why grinding sucks the end.

433
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:57,882
Scott: Let's go home.

434
00:28:58,043 --> 00:29:00,293
Rym: Yeah, no grinding serves its purpose.

435
00:29:00,353 --> 00:29:01,257
Rym: Grinding is a good thing.

436
00:29:01,277 --> 00:29:01,960
Rym: in some games.

437
00:29:02,302 --> 00:29:03,348
Rym: There's different kinds of grind.

438
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,576
Rym: this I'm just.

439
00:29:04,616 --> 00:29:05,160
Rym: I'm feeling it.

440
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:16,831
Rym: This is gonna be more like that dude, bro Like those old lectures we used to do because I don't know that clocks ring and I feel good about this one Because I've noticed the lectures that we really really like.

441
00:29:17,412 --> 00:29:21,845
Rym: we basically do like twice at conventions and The second time we do it.

442
00:29:22,266 --> 00:29:27,559
Rym: that video is what we put on YouTube and it's just perfect and we never run it anywhere again Because the perfect versions on YouTube.

443
00:29:28,883 --> 00:29:30,660
Rym: But then we got lazy for a while cuz we've been busy.

444
00:29:30,801 --> 00:29:34,360
Rym: So we'll take like one panel and run it at like eight conventions.

445
00:29:35,382 --> 00:29:37,450
Rym: I feel like this one might be a one and done on YouTube.

446
00:29:37,872 --> 00:29:38,093
Rym: Hmm.

447
00:29:38,675 --> 00:29:40,622
Rym: See I'm playing Babe Ruth in it Pointing.

448
00:29:40,643 --> 00:29:41,586
Rym: I think this one's gonna be good.

449
00:29:41,967 --> 00:29:45,017
Rym: Whatever also packs is five four days six.

450
00:29:45,058 --> 00:29:49,875
Rym: if you go to dev I'm gonna be there for all six days and it's gonna be amazing.

451
00:29:49,895 --> 00:29:56,395
Rym: I Don't think we have any conventions after that until mag fest good, which we'll be performing at.

452
00:29:56,716 --> 00:29:57,719
Rym: and yeah.

453
00:29:58,562 --> 00:30:05,820
Rym: So speaking of you know, those kinds of lectures there was a panel we did at a PAX a long goddamn time ago.

454
00:30:05,941 --> 00:30:10,941
Rym: This was like PAX Prime 2010 or it might have been like East 2011.

455
00:30:10,941 --> 00:30:15,236
Scott: the thing we said at this panel was we've been saying much longer.

456
00:30:15,297 --> 00:30:17,992
Rym: well before we did that Yeah, but they culminated in this panel.

457
00:30:18,012 --> 00:30:25,032
Rym: We called the panel egregiously unrealized potential and we were like Why doesn't someone remake tie fighter like we?

458
00:30:25,052 --> 00:30:26,740
Rym: just all these things like why doesn't someone do this?

459
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,698
Rym: Why doesn't someone do that?

460
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:36,780
Rym: And then we talked about like why the remake of bionic commando From the NES was way better than the game that it was made to promote and all that nonsense.

461
00:30:37,442 --> 00:30:42,655
Rym: But then at the very end our last slide was just Pokemon Pokemon MMO.

462
00:30:42,675 --> 00:30:43,397
Rym: Let's fucking do it.

463
00:30:43,738 --> 00:30:44,420
Rym: It'll end the world.

464
00:30:44,701 --> 00:30:46,189
Rym: It'll be the most important thing ever like.

465
00:30:46,209 --> 00:30:47,255
Rym: it'll change everything.

466
00:30:47,677 --> 00:30:54,540
Scott: and we were right Yeah, they're also right when I said that Pokemon go is just gonna be ingress of the Pokemon skin on it.

467
00:30:54,761 --> 00:31:01,538
Rym: So I'd listen to because we talked about ingress on GeekNights when it came out and we you know We played a whole bunch, which is why I feel no need to play Pokemon.

468
00:31:01,558 --> 00:31:06,843
Rym: Yeah But we played ingress a lot because it was the first one that played it a moderate amount.

469
00:31:06,884 --> 00:31:13,360
Rym: we played it a bunch for a short span of time to be able to Understand it because it was the first modern AR game.

470
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:16,231
Scott: No, the first modern AR game was that thing that EA did in 2001.

471
00:31:16,231 --> 00:31:20,473
Scott: That was I don't argue No, I said you and called you on the phone.

472
00:31:20,493 --> 00:31:21,540
Rym: I know what you're talking about.

473
00:31:21,661 --> 00:31:23,348
Rym: I think that's a different class of air again.

474
00:31:23,368 --> 00:31:25,960
Scott: I'm just saying it's that's that's even more AR than yeah.

475
00:31:26,241 --> 00:31:32,474
Scott: But that's why I said modern AR also Pokemon go Only a little bit of AR going on.

476
00:31:32,514 --> 00:31:33,720
Scott: It's mostly just Jeep.

477
00:31:33,921 --> 00:31:36,068
Scott: It's mostly just a game that has GPS in.

478
00:31:36,109 --> 00:31:39,260
Scott: that's the very definition of AR that it has a GPS.

479
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,209
Rym: It's overlaid on the real world in your real life.

480
00:31:41,269 --> 00:31:43,359
Rym: There's there's physical things in your alter.

481
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,348
Scott: Your reality isn't altered by Scott and you're playing.

482
00:31:46,369 --> 00:32:00,518
Rym: but AR AR game like version one would have been when people Told a story about a place in a novel and that Think about the things the novel said about that place.

483
00:32:01,742 --> 00:32:06,785
Rym: Version two would have been like geocaching But whatever.

484
00:32:07,026 --> 00:32:14,000
Rym: anyway, when you talked about ingress we both said Multiple times that this is the model.

485
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,729
Rym: This is the blueprint for a real AR game down the road.

486
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,894
Rym: Like this is clearly just a candy box.

487
00:32:19,934 --> 00:32:24,540
Rym: This is Google through Niantic Experimenting with this concept.

488
00:32:25,061 --> 00:32:29,353
Rym: It's like the beta test that they're gonna use this data to make a real game later.

489
00:32:29,373 --> 00:32:31,900
Rym: and then a while ago years ago.

490
00:32:32,021 --> 00:32:32,526
Rym: Was it years ago?

491
00:32:32,546 --> 00:32:33,899
Rym: was a while ago at least a year ago.

492
00:32:34,041 --> 00:32:42,883
Rym: but remember when one day Pokemon just appeared in Google Maps for a day and then they disappeared like just there were Pokemon in places around the world and you could Yeah, poke up.

493
00:32:42,923 --> 00:32:57,795
Rym: Nintendo and Google have been pretty tight with Pokemon and stuff for quite a while They've been friendly to each other when that happened that one day I was like, there's a Pidgeotto just on Google Maps and I clicked on it and now I have a Pidgeotto.

494
00:32:58,236 --> 00:32:59,399
Rym: and then like we talked about it.

495
00:32:59,821 --> 00:33:20,799
Rym: but what one thing that I said in that GeekNights was It's interesting because that means that Google and Nintendo Talked to each other and made that happen like Roger Rabbit style including characters of multiple properties Which meant Google and Pokemon were talking or Google and Nintendo were talking and we basically predicted that this was gonna

496
00:33:20,859 --> 00:33:21,120
Scott: happen.

497
00:33:22,095 --> 00:33:27,395
Rym: Yeah physical plant Mm-hmm, and sure enough we were right 100% it happened.

498
00:33:27,656 --> 00:33:28,118
Rym: and here it is.

499
00:33:28,701 --> 00:33:32,640
Scott: Yeah, I mean we talked about it when it was announced and now it's here except the wristband thing isn't here yet.

500
00:33:33,043 --> 00:33:35,181
Scott: Yep, the race is exactly what we said It would be.

501
00:33:35,502 --> 00:33:43,176
Scott: yep, and it's interesting because it changed all those people who were like, oh man, you know, they kept saying stuff It wasn't gonna be and I told them they were wrong and they didn't believe me.

502
00:33:43,196 --> 00:33:46,798
Scott: They're like, oh, yeah There's gonna be like battling and I'm like, no there isn't and we were right there isn't.

503
00:33:46,959 --> 00:33:50,491
Rym: well There sort of is but not regular not really not the way that they were thinking.

504
00:33:50,792 --> 00:34:00,334
Rym: now, it's interesting because Nintendo they've said Features will come and they have said specifically Trading and all those other things are going to come.

505
00:34:00,454 --> 00:34:06,045
Scott: and the people are also like, oh, yeah You'll be able to get Pokemon and bring them into your Gameboy game and I'm like, nope That's never gonna happen.

506
00:34:06,707 --> 00:34:09,639
Rym: I think some of those things might happen down the road, but not all of them.

507
00:34:10,523 --> 00:34:11,266
Rym: Here's my prediction.

508
00:34:11,868 --> 00:34:28,657
Rym: I think Pokemon go is going to be kept like Studiosly separate from the real Pokemon games for the foreseeable future in the sense that None of the companies involved will ever let Pokemon Bago Cannibalize even one sale of a regular Pokemon game.

509
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:31,600
Rym: Mm-hmm And that is that is not on the table.

510
00:34:31,801 --> 00:34:37,670
Scott: All they want to do is use Pokemon go to boost the sales of regular Pokemon and vice versa Which I think they're going to very well.

511
00:34:37,891 --> 00:34:47,599
Rym: Yeah, I also think When the inevitable happens and Nintendo is no longer a hardware company Maybe maybe not like well very likely someday that'll happen.

512
00:34:48,061 --> 00:35:01,330
Rym: But when there's no hardware anymore or Nintendo the other option is Nintendo might go the oculus road and start making Increasingly specialized hardware, but like we you not the greatest thing in the world Like there's a reason we don't just want to play Mario maker.

513
00:35:01,351 --> 00:35:02,174
Scott: I don't play anything else.

514
00:35:02,275 --> 00:35:04,183
Rym: Yeah, and remember the big game I wanted to play on?

515
00:35:04,223 --> 00:35:05,226
Rym: it was actually Splatoon.

516
00:35:05,528 --> 00:35:07,414
Rym: No overwatch like Splatoon is dead.

517
00:35:07,435 --> 00:35:10,447
Scott: I don't I never needed to place Look, it's a real good game.

518
00:35:10,487 --> 00:35:11,934
Scott: I'm sure but it's better.

519
00:35:11,954 --> 00:35:13,200
Scott: I don't need I don't need that in my life.

520
00:35:13,867 --> 00:35:23,305
Rym: I did need it in my life but it wasn't worth owning a Wii U to have and the fact that it's basically dead now in light of overwatch means I was correct, but Pokemon go.

521
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:40,960
Rym: if Nintendo stops being a hardware company and goes the way of Sega and Start selling like regular Pokemon games like on Steam or on other consoles or just on phones Then the great singularity will happen with Pokemon go but only then.

522
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,707
Rym: It's unlikely.

523
00:35:42,889 --> 00:35:44,140
Scott: don't hold your breath for that one.

524
00:35:44,283 --> 00:35:49,419
Rym: Yeah, exactly That is a distant future that requires a lot of different dominoes to fall over.

525
00:35:49,741 --> 00:35:54,632
Scott: So since I knew exactly what it was gonna be and it turned out to be right I never even bothered to play Pokemon go.

526
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:55,639
Scott: have you played Pokemon go?

527
00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:00,736
Rym: I played it but I did play ingress all the way up to level 8 to really like.

528
00:36:00,816 --> 00:36:02,000
Scott: see I played it.

529
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,952
Scott: I don't even know what level I'd have to log in and find out.

530
00:36:03,972 --> 00:36:06,728
Rym: but I got to level 8 just because that was the highest level in the game when it came out.

531
00:36:07,211 --> 00:36:08,499
Rym: and then they added 8 more levels.

532
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:11,689
Rym: and There's a fact and what I noticed this is the prayer.

533
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:13,840
Rym: the most interesting thing about Pokemon go that's happening right now.

534
00:36:14,941 --> 00:36:22,619
Rym: social media People who are playing the game notice How much experience you need to get past?

535
00:36:23,521 --> 00:36:25,247
Rym: Some level in the in the future.

536
00:36:25,288 --> 00:36:30,700
Rym: like if you play it you get to like level 14 or whatever like to get to the next Level you need a lot of experience.

537
00:36:31,141 --> 00:36:39,005
Rym: They realize that it's basically an exponential curve of the amount of experience you need to continue advancing The same way.

538
00:36:39,025 --> 00:36:42,417
Rym: it was like to get to level 2. you need like one experience.

539
00:36:42,457 --> 00:36:43,240
Rym: fucking just did happen.

540
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,046
Rym: You're already level 2.

541
00:36:44,046 --> 00:36:48,320
Rym: Yeah to get to like level 4 It's like alright you need like a hundred to get to level 8.

542
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,453
Rym: It's like you need a thousand to get a level 9.

543
00:36:50,453 --> 00:36:51,680
Rym: It's like you need a billion.

544
00:36:53,840 --> 00:37:01,950
Rym: All candy box games must have Exponential progression or they will fail.

545
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:09,440
Scott: if you have linear progression people just keep progressing like whoop whoop Yep, and they don't feel and then you can't really get away from anyone.

546
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:12,099
Scott: So it doesn't really feel good to be high level because everyone's high level.

547
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:19,139
Rym: Yep, because you remember there is no cost to you to level up in Pokemon go except you keep clicking.

548
00:37:19,881 --> 00:37:23,772
Rym: But if you just keep poking at the game, you'll just keep leveling up.

549
00:37:24,454 --> 00:37:41,499
Rym: So the only way to make that Monetizable and to make sure that levels matter in some way is to make that leveling curve be to the point that even crazy Joey Jojo Shabadoo who plays this game 24 hours a day seven days a week Eventually Peters out and hits a vertical line.

550
00:37:41,741 --> 00:37:47,480
Scott: Yeah, you need to separate Joey Jojo from the non Shabadoo version right at least by one level.

551
00:37:47,763 --> 00:37:48,979
Scott: So you need to have that gap there.

552
00:37:49,941 --> 00:37:55,399
Rym: But also the game is competitive, but it's competitive in the same way that ingress is.

553
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,041
Rym: in fact It's even.

554
00:37:56,061 --> 00:38:03,569
Scott: I've spent more time on the game than you and there's more people who on my team color living in this area than I mean, basically the way it works is it.

555
00:38:03,649 --> 00:38:10,100
Rym: they added a few things that make it objectively way better than ingress But they took some ingress concepts and super fucking dumbed him down.

556
00:38:10,702 --> 00:38:15,140
Rym: So ingress has the portals and you like have to team up with people and like collaborate to connect them together.

557
00:38:15,901 --> 00:38:17,125
Rym: All that teamwork is gone.

558
00:38:17,547 --> 00:38:19,233
Rym: Like teamwork doesn't mean anything in this game.

559
00:38:19,273 --> 00:38:21,200
Rym: Really like the team you're on fuck it.

560
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,449
Rym: It doesn't matter like who cares also everyone.

561
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:24,814
Scott: art is also no green team.

562
00:38:25,076 --> 00:38:34,541
Rym: Everyone smarts on the blue team Because the blue team is like we're gonna learn about stuff and the red team is like we're gonna be strong and the yellow team Is.

563
00:38:35,043 --> 00:38:35,927
Rym: don't trust science.

564
00:38:35,987 --> 00:38:36,810
Rym: go with your gut.

565
00:38:37,332 --> 00:38:38,155
Scott: fuck you yellow team.

566
00:38:38,195 --> 00:38:39,420
Rym: Yeah, the yellow team is Hufflepuff.

567
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:41,250
Scott: Fuck you yellow team so much.

568
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:43,180
Rym: I mean, I really wanted to be Team Rocket.

569
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,960
Rym: I feel like I could still be Team Rocket.

570
00:38:45,061 --> 00:38:45,665
Rym: All I have to do

571
00:38:45,746 --> 00:38:47,943
Scott: green team or Team Rocket should be the teams but they're

572
00:38:47,963 --> 00:38:59,031
Rym: not all you have to do to be Team Rocket is Place a Pokemon lure at night and then hide in that place and when kids show up playing Pokemon Literally run over punch them out steal their phones steal their Pokemon.

573
00:38:59,131 --> 00:38:59,712
Scott: steal the fuck.

574
00:39:00,154 --> 00:39:00,615
Rym: think about it.

575
00:39:01,177 --> 00:39:02,340
Rym: Team Rocket could be real.

576
00:39:02,581 --> 00:39:07,498
Rym: You can literally mug a kid and steal his real Team Rocket cosplay.

577
00:39:07,538 --> 00:39:10,129
Scott: come out do the thing The kids be like, yeah, and then steal their Pokemon.

578
00:39:10,149 --> 00:39:11,254
Rym: Yeah, then you're like, no really kid.

579
00:39:11,274 --> 00:39:11,615
Rym: Give me your.

580
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:12,640
Rym: give me your fucking Pokemon.

581
00:39:12,981 --> 00:39:13,904
Rym: I'm taking that Pikachu.

582
00:39:14,545 --> 00:39:15,608
Rym: No, no, give me the phone.

583
00:39:15,629 --> 00:39:17,735
Rym: I'm gonna Brian gonna break your phone and kill your Pikachu.

584
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:20,819
Rym: I Feel like this has got to happen.

585
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:32,291
Rym: But anyway, so instead of all that portals stuff with the connecting together and the shields and the stuff pokestops you basically go up to them and You have to literally like click on the screen.

586
00:39:32,371 --> 00:39:34,040
Scott: one seriously in a pokestop in a gym.

587
00:39:34,361 --> 00:39:36,368
Rym: So a pokestop is an ingress portal.

588
00:39:36,388 --> 00:39:44,119
Rym: you walk up to it and you got to go into the screen and you see the circle That shows like what the thing is that you don't care about and then you've got to spin it.

589
00:39:44,761 --> 00:39:46,768
Rym: You put your thumb on it and you spin it.

590
00:39:46,888 --> 00:39:50,279
Rym: Whoa, and you know what, you know how fucking non-intuitive this is.

591
00:39:50,943 --> 00:39:53,059
Rym: I didn't know how to interact with them until I looked it up.

592
00:39:53,501 --> 00:39:58,040
Rym: Mmm, I know at no point did I think I should spin that thing.

593
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:06,773
Rym: So you go to the pokestop and you spin it a bunch and then a bunch of bubbles appear like four or five bubbles With like individual pokeballs in them and you click on them all to get them.

594
00:40:06,793 --> 00:40:11,863
Rym: Okay, which is just real real Real like.

595
00:40:12,245 --> 00:40:15,280
Scott: see you basically sit there tapping to collect pokeballs.

596
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,759
Rym: Yeah, but you know you got to physically walk to the thing and tap it.

597
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,699
Rym: Okay, and then you can go to a gym and if you have a really high level Pokemon you can attack the gym.

598
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:30,240
Rym: and Then you play this really bullshitty game where you jump your Pokemon left and right and like real-time battle the guy.

599
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:39,553
Rym: but level is the only thing that actually matters and level is the CP value and CP value basically just means you spent the most time playing game.

600
00:40:39,834 --> 00:40:41,580
Rym: you level up like you want to level up your riddle.

601
00:40:42,323 --> 00:40:44,159
Rym: You got to catch like a million wheedles.

602
00:40:44,822 --> 00:40:48,999
Rym: Grind them all into wheedle candy feed wheedle candy to your wheedle to level them up.

603
00:40:50,003 --> 00:40:54,440
Rym: So there's basically no way to level up your starter because you can't find Bulbasaurs out there to get Bulbasaur candy.

604
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,829
Rym: So your starter is just completely useless bullshit.

605
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:57,874
Scott: You can't feed a wheedle candy.

606
00:40:58,074 --> 00:40:58,215
Rym: Nope.

607
00:40:58,235 --> 00:41:02,100
Rym: You gotta feed them Bulbasaur candy Because I know you all caught a Bulbasaur in your bathroom.

608
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:08,060
Scott: No, basically, really you only have one of each Pokemon, but their level is equal to pretty much the number of that Pokemon that you've caught.

609
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,311
Rym: Yep, so you catch like a million wheedles.

610
00:41:10,331 --> 00:41:12,120
Rym: then when you're bored what about evolution, right?

611
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:16,320
Scott: So if I catch a wheedle and it becomes a you know, be drill eventually, right?

612
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,930
Scott: Then I catch wheedles and I can't find any be drills in the wild.

613
00:41:20,031 --> 00:41:23,062
Scott: Oh every can I feed the wheedle candy to the be Drill.

614
00:41:23,304 --> 00:41:23,607
Rym: Yes.

615
00:41:23,768 --> 00:41:24,454
Rym: All right, that's fine.

616
00:41:24,696 --> 00:41:24,837
Rym: Yep.

617
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:25,240
Rym: That's fine.

618
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:32,525
Rym: You can also catch evolved Pokemon all the original all the original 150 or whatever in the game right now You and you two and Dragonite.

619
00:41:32,585 --> 00:41:34,772
Rym: and supposedly you can't get like those.

620
00:41:34,812 --> 00:41:36,176
Rym: you yet zapdos.

621
00:41:36,377 --> 00:41:38,485
Rym: I think it zapdos already Legendary stuff.

622
00:41:38,606 --> 00:41:39,430
Rym: There's I think you can't.

623
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:39,932
Rym: I'm not sure.

624
00:41:40,053 --> 00:41:41,540
Rym: like I said, I haven't really played that much.

625
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,465
Rym: I got like you gone.

626
00:41:42,726 --> 00:41:44,495
Rym: I got like 40 Pokemon, but I got omenite.

627
00:41:44,978 --> 00:41:49,160
Rym: omenite I just caught the omenite like a ConnectiCon just like I'd say these teams raise helix.

628
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:54,088
Rym: But Some Pokemon are region exclusive.

629
00:41:54,128 --> 00:41:59,373
Rym: I think Tara or whatever like one of the one of those Pokemon is like Australia only or Genghis Khan.

630
00:41:59,394 --> 00:42:01,923
Rym: Genghis Khan is The kangaroo.

631
00:42:02,084 --> 00:42:02,345
Scott: Yep.

632
00:42:02,646 --> 00:42:03,850
Rym: Yeah, and mr.

633
00:42:03,971 --> 00:42:07,802
Rym: Mime is the Europe exclusive the mime Only.

634
00:42:07,982 --> 00:42:10,589
Rym: yeah, the best way I saw it was like Europe.

635
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:12,434
Rym: We're so sorry.

636
00:42:12,454 --> 00:42:13,156
Scott: I'm not sorry.

637
00:42:13,216 --> 00:42:13,657
Scott: Fuck you.

638
00:42:13,677 --> 00:42:17,972
Rym: Yeah And already all our friends were like Rym.

639
00:42:18,273 --> 00:42:19,500
Rym: You've got to fucking get us Pokemon.

640
00:42:20,522 --> 00:42:21,486
Rym: I'll be in Australia soon.

641
00:42:21,546 --> 00:42:23,033
Scott: So you can get Pokemon for people.

642
00:42:23,113 --> 00:42:23,756
Scott: There's no trading.

643
00:42:23,857 --> 00:42:24,560
Rym: there will be trading.

644
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,009
Rym: They've officially said trading will come whatever.

645
00:42:27,552 --> 00:42:34,280
Rym: but yeah, the gym is basically just be Ridiculous high-level because you wasted your life and then you can play this bullshitty game.

646
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:41,378
Rym: That really only level matters to take control of the gym and then your Pokemon stays in the gym Fighting off other people until someone else beats it.

647
00:42:41,921 --> 00:42:44,755
Scott: So when your Pokemon is in the gym, can you use it say at another gym?

648
00:42:45,097 --> 00:42:46,425
Scott: It's just stuck there It's just stuck there.

649
00:42:46,505 --> 00:42:47,432
Scott: What happens if it gets beat?

650
00:42:47,835 --> 00:42:51,920
Rym: it comes back to you I think I guess dead and then you gotta like revive it and then you can use it again.

651
00:42:52,162 --> 00:42:54,040
Scott: Is it at the level it was or does it lose all its levels?

652
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:58,722
Rym: I think it stays at the level it was at but the gyms Suck.

653
00:42:58,823 --> 00:43:02,680
Rym: like I I decided like this game I will play it because it is actually really fun.

654
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:08,078
Rym: The third piece of the game is the air part where you're walking down the street and it buzzes.

655
00:43:08,098 --> 00:43:19,820
Rym: You're like, oh shit There's Pokemon and you pull your phone out and you look at your camera and then you find it and it's in a physical place Like a specific physical place and you see it on your screen overlaid over the real world and it like pegs.

656
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:21,326
Scott: Then you take a funny screenshot and tweet it.

657
00:43:21,527 --> 00:43:24,720
Rym: Yep, because it yeah, you know how many Pokemon I have on people's dicks.

658
00:43:25,082 --> 00:43:27,720
Scott: I'm enjoying the tweets without having to play the game.

659
00:43:28,001 --> 00:43:30,472
Scott: I'm getting the full benefit without having to waste my life.

660
00:43:30,773 --> 00:43:43,060
Rym: that part of the game is Super fun because like I was walking down the street the other day and my phone buzzes and I look I see a Pidgeotto and I'm like, ooh And I tried to catch it, but it kept flying away from me.

661
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:45,279
Rym: So I like fucking come back here and I'm like chasing this Pidgeotto.

662
00:43:45,701 --> 00:43:47,607
Rym: I threw like 20 pokeballs at it before I got it.

663
00:43:47,627 --> 00:43:50,456
Rym: Hmm, but that's the only part of the game.

664
00:43:50,496 --> 00:43:50,897
Rym: That's fun.

665
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:58,720
Rym: So I am literally not going to try to level up Never gonna interact with the gyms because they're stupid and also the gym near my office.

666
00:43:58,760 --> 00:43:59,805
Scott: He's gonna try to get funny screenshots.

667
00:44:00,067 --> 00:44:08,719
Rym: If you live somewhere still like somewhere like Hicksville Like the local gym has like a CP 30 like you can just go put your Magikarp in there and you're good to go.

668
00:44:09,467 --> 00:44:14,799
Rym: but in Manhattan The gym next to me changes hands like a hundred times a day.

669
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:22,020
Rym: Lie and add that the people who are attacking it are so high level that I don't even know how that happens.

670
00:44:22,362 --> 00:44:23,832
Scott: They're not doing anything else with their lives.

671
00:44:23,953 --> 00:44:24,859
Scott: They're not podcasting.

672
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,207
Scott: Yeah, I just play Pokemon.

673
00:44:26,227 --> 00:44:28,600
Scott: go play it and while they're work play it on the subway play it on the way home.

674
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:29,546
Scott: Play play play play play.

675
00:44:29,707 --> 00:44:30,512
Rym: So I guess don't get me wrong.

676
00:44:30,532 --> 00:44:34,910
Rym: The game is fun, but it is Like the minimum effort.

677
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:36,316
Scott: it is the mindless candy box.

678
00:44:36,356 --> 00:44:38,648
Rym: We thought it would be yep And the AR part is fun.

679
00:44:39,031 --> 00:44:40,319
Rym: None of the other parts of it are fun.

680
00:44:41,163 --> 00:44:48,636
Rym: If you think you're gonna play it at all It's probably worth it to play it now and put in the minimum effort Because this kind of game the other thing that's likely to happen strike

681
00:44:48,656 --> 00:44:49,280
Scott: while the irons hot

682
00:44:49,763 --> 00:45:04,339
Rym: When they add more stuff to make the game better You don't want to decide to start the game then because then you're that dude who's playing World of Warcraft Doing the beginning like terrible contents while everyone else is playing the new awesome thing that came out.

683
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:12,960
Scott: You're that dude who tries to start playing netrunner and everyone else's already has all these cards or playing You know Magic the Gathering and everyone else already has all these cards.

684
00:45:14,521 --> 00:45:22,180
Rym: So and also usually these kinds of games There'll be ways to level up now to power level that will probably disappear in the future.

685
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:26,380
Scott: You show up at the Warhammer meetup and you got your brand new little tiny piece of Space Marine.

686
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:33,080
Scott: But everyone else and a man everyone longer than you are Already has a giant painted army and you got your little squad.

687
00:45:33,923 --> 00:45:35,280
Rym: But the AR part is super fun.

688
00:45:35,421 --> 00:45:40,842
Rym: So I do recommend it to play that part because the thing I say I'm saying that's amazing is Like.

689
00:45:41,123 --> 00:45:43,880
Rym: so when we came home from Connecticut was like right after the game went live.

690
00:45:44,642 --> 00:45:50,400
Rym: I got to the subway station in Long Island City pretty late at night like 11 o'clock and I come out of the subway station.

691
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:54,640
Rym: You know Queens Plaza like way over in the middle of nowhere and I'm walking back through that park.

692
00:45:54,961 --> 00:45:56,467
Rym: There's a little park under the subway tracks.

693
00:45:56,487 --> 00:45:58,655
Rym: That's empty like hobos live there.

694
00:45:58,675 --> 00:45:59,558
Rym: Like there's never anyone there.

695
00:45:59,578 --> 00:46:01,565
Rym: at night It was crowded.

696
00:46:02,107 --> 00:46:06,160
Rym: there were like 40 people milling around and every one of them had Pokemon out.

697
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,731
Scott: There are a lot of people playing this game.

698
00:46:08,174 --> 00:46:08,960
Scott: like no question.

699
00:46:09,061 --> 00:46:09,443
Scott: I see.

700
00:46:09,644 --> 00:46:12,320
Scott: I see this game being played on the street pretty much everywhere.

701
00:46:12,461 --> 00:46:15,160
Rym: Yeah, like there's a giant crowd of people the funniest thing in the world.

702
00:46:15,361 --> 00:46:19,960
Rym: There's a big crowd of people in City Hall Park and every day they're there like huge amounts of people.

703
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:20,979
Rym: They're all playing the game.

704
00:46:21,622 --> 00:46:35,607
Rym: There's this one dude and he's there like multiple times a week when I'm out at lunch and he's like He's basically trying to be an evangelist for ingress to the Pokemon kids like oh kid I see you're playing Pokemon.

705
00:46:35,808 --> 00:46:37,896
Rym: You want to play the real game the Pokemon is based on.

706
00:46:37,936 --> 00:46:39,999
Rym: the kids are like, dude No that game sucks.

707
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:42,887
Scott: But why doesn't he just start playing Pokemon?

708
00:46:42,907 --> 00:46:43,810
Rym: because he's real mad.

709
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:46,498
Rym: all the ingress people seem real mad that everyone's playing Pokemon.

710
00:46:46,539 --> 00:46:47,583
Scott: because What is?

711
00:46:47,623 --> 00:46:48,548
Scott: it is shut ingress down?

712
00:46:48,568 --> 00:46:49,071
Scott: What's the point?

713
00:46:49,232 --> 00:46:50,740
Rym: because the people who played are obsessed with it?

714
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:51,988
Scott: There's not that many people playing it.

715
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:53,460
Rym: There's a decent number of people playing it.

716
00:46:54,082 --> 00:46:55,947
Scott: Money on it just cost money to run.

717
00:46:55,967 --> 00:46:56,629
Scott: just shut it down.

718
00:46:56,930 --> 00:46:58,776
Rym: Remember Pokemon also has microtransactions.

719
00:46:59,458 --> 00:47:00,140
Rym: It's monetized.

720
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:01,324
Scott: Well, what can you buy?

721
00:47:01,545 --> 00:47:05,660
Rym: you can buy in-game money that can be used to buy like pokeballs and upgrades and shit.

722
00:47:05,861 --> 00:47:08,136
Scott: So basically spend money and you don't have to spin the hoop.

723
00:47:08,438 --> 00:47:12,286
Scott: Yep So they see instead of spinning the hoop at the focus top You can just pay money and get pokeballs.

724
00:47:12,327 --> 00:47:16,746
Rym: So all the people who said when Nintendo finally does mobile They'll do mobile right and mobile different.

725
00:47:16,806 --> 00:47:17,969
Rym: No, they're doing mobile the same.

726
00:47:18,632 --> 00:47:20,517
Rym: It's same mobile just with a Pokemon skin.

727
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:21,099
Rym: Mm-hmm.

728
00:47:23,221 --> 00:47:27,654
Rym: But that's the thing that's interesting there with the ingress stuff is that ingress existed.

729
00:47:28,416 --> 00:47:29,720
Rym: it was the beta test for Pokemon.

730
00:47:30,282 --> 00:47:33,852
Rym: Pokemon comes out and now you have something that's never happened before.

731
00:47:34,273 --> 00:47:38,478
Rym: there's two augmented reality games Which are overlays on the real world, right?

732
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:40,684
Rym: They use the same data.

733
00:47:41,265 --> 00:47:44,132
Rym: So every pokestop is an ingress portal.

734
00:47:44,693 --> 00:47:51,380
Rym: Okay, meaning the two games clash with each other in the real world.

735
00:47:52,461 --> 00:48:04,560
Rym: It'd be like if you made a an MMO and then someone else made a different MMO But somehow like characters from the two MMOs could see each other because they're set in the same world of like a while or whatever.

736
00:48:05,421 --> 00:48:05,621
Rym: Like.

737
00:48:05,782 --> 00:48:10,033
Rym: that's the kind of thing that no one who designed video games ever had to worry about before.

738
00:48:10,334 --> 00:48:25,048
Rym: but because the substrate for AR Games is reality if you decide to put a thing in your AR game in the real world It effectively conflicts with any other AR game that has the thing in that same place also conflicts with real life.

739
00:48:25,769 --> 00:48:29,879
Rym: Yes, and No one's answered all those questions yet.

740
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:45,500
Rym: So just like when mobas started appearing or MMOs started appearing or video games started appearing Although there's a whole bunch of new questions No one's ever had to ask before and suddenly a whole bunch of people on Twitter are giving really bad answers to those questions.

741
00:48:49,831 --> 00:48:52,078
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

Rym: Now food comes in through the chimney mouth and goes from room to room Greeting the different organs.

759

Rym: Hello Now the good healthy food is very nice and polite to the organs and so is invited to stay for a party.

760
00:51:08,653 --> 00:51:14,669
Rym: Yay, but the bad not healthy foods are very rude and must leave through the cat flap.

761
00:51:34,142 --> 00:51:34,765
Rym: What's that?

762
00:51:34,965 --> 00:51:36,010
