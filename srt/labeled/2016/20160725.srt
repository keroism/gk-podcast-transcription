1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,903
Rym: It's Monday July 25th 2016.

2
00:00:12,903 --> 00:00:16,050
Rym: I'm Rym, I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:16,372 --> 00:00:21,658
Rym: the right to repair and the DMCA and all that nonsense in Still a problem.

4
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:25,017
Rym: Let's do this.

5
00:00:27,773 --> 00:00:42,990
Rym: It was raining so hard that when I got off the salt like I was on the subway in the seven train after like ridiculous Delays and like people crammed in everywhere I basically only got on the car because I sort of Shoved people out of the way and elbowed my way on there wedged myself in a corner.

6
00:00:43,533 --> 00:00:58,447
Rym: But then when the train came out of the tunnel into the daylight into the wall of rain the rain hit the subway car so hard that people in the car kind of went like ah and everyone sort Of reacted in a surprising and shocked fashion, which I've never seen people do on the subway before.

7
00:00:58,627 --> 00:00:59,510
Scott: so it was nice and clean.

8
00:00:59,953 --> 00:01:01,749
Rym: Yeah, nice and air-conditioned car wash.

9
00:01:02,712 --> 00:01:11,587
Rym: Yeah, I'm actually impressed at how well all the air conditioning and that system is working considering We're riding relatively new train cars even though you saw they're gonna get all new new train cars soon.

10
00:01:11,627 --> 00:01:16,084
Scott: with the bumbleweeds I thought they were just modifying existing cars to put little thingies in between.

11
00:01:16,164 --> 00:01:25,376
Rym: hard to say because the Story looks like I think they're gonna take the oldest rolling stock and replace it with the ones that'll have the sort of articulated Open framework and less seats.

12
00:01:25,657 --> 00:01:25,798
Scott: well.

13
00:01:25,818 --> 00:01:29,310
Scott: Yeah, I mean you always assume the newest cars replaced the oldest cars.

14
00:01:29,451 --> 00:01:32,730
Rym: Yeah, except apparently I guess the C train will never get anything replaced.

15
00:01:33,071 --> 00:01:33,452
Scott: Why not?

16
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:38,990
Rym: the C train has the word the oldest worst rolling stock in the entire system then aren't isn't that first in line to get?

17
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:39,492
Scott: Replaced?

18
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:39,955
Rym: I don't know.

19
00:01:39,996 --> 00:01:42,270
Rym: the C trains weird - they're shorter than the other trains.

20
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,923
Rym: Okay, you know what you don't know about the C. Have you ever ridden the C on purpose?

21
00:01:47,445 --> 00:01:49,438
Scott: I've ridden other blue I don't know.

22
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:55,790
Scott: I've ridden blue trains, but I've never ridden a blue train where it mattered which one I took unless it was the e.

23
00:01:56,231 --> 00:01:58,419
Rym: Yeah, yeah, the e is the useful one.

24
00:01:58,459 --> 00:01:59,663
Rym: the a is the a one.

25
00:01:59,683 --> 00:02:02,414
Scott: unless you're going to Brooklyn like if I'm taking a blue Train it's either.

26
00:02:02,434 --> 00:02:04,907
Scott: I need the e or I need any blue train.

27
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:07,990
Scott: Yep I don't think and I don't know which one I'm on.

28
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:12,730
Rym: I'll bet you haven't ridden any train cuz the train kind of sucks like a lot of e trains to go to the no.

29
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,298
Rym: No, sorry the C. The C. You're probably never ridden.

30
00:02:15,478 --> 00:02:24,170
Rym: I mean, I've just if I have I didn't you know see is notably shitty Okay, but anyway, so I was in the beach this weekend and something strange happened.

31
00:02:24,954 --> 00:02:39,718
Rym: I was at Russo's, you know that place like we always do standing there with Emily we're waiting for our Russo sandwiches to get finished by the ladies behind the counter and Suddenly and what looks like an employee of Russo's Wearing a Santa hat walk.

32
00:02:39,979 --> 00:02:42,046
Scott: I had to head in July

33
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:51,300
Rym: walks up to us holding a bunch of things that they call sand scrapers that are like this as-seen-on-tv thing to get sand off your feet and

34
00:02:52,304 --> 00:02:53,711
Scott: Three and stupid big

35
00:02:53,791 --> 00:03:00,599
Rym: blocks of Boar's Head cheese Like wrapped up packaged Boar's Head cheese, and they're like Merry Christmas and they hand it to us.

36
00:03:01,262 --> 00:03:08,062
Rym: They handed you free cheese like three huge blocks of cheese and these Expired.

37
00:03:08,464 --> 00:03:09,729
Rym: it expires next year.

38
00:03:09,809 --> 00:03:10,592
Rym: Like it's fine.

39
00:03:10,873 --> 00:03:12,580
Scott: Why didn't they give it to the units to everybody?

40
00:03:13,161 --> 00:03:19,304
Rym: So we're looking at her and Emily's like, oh, no, thanks, you know, cuz like you do when someone's more you Yeah, and gives you cheese.

41
00:03:19,545 --> 00:03:22,976
Rym: that is either a scam or they stole that cheese.

42
00:03:22,996 --> 00:03:23,478
Scott: That's right.

43
00:03:23,498 --> 00:03:24,020
Scott: We don't want that.

44
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:24,543
Scott: What is going on?

45
00:03:24,563 --> 00:03:26,917
Rym: Yeah, and they're like, it's Christmas in July.

46
00:03:27,017 --> 00:03:27,420
Rym: It's free.

47
00:03:27,661 --> 00:03:28,323
Rym: You can take it.

48
00:03:28,604 --> 00:03:38,000
Rym: and then I noticed that there's other Russo's people walking around giving everyone in the store like three or four Giant blocks of cheese all like so big you need your own deli slicer to cut it.

49
00:03:38,141 --> 00:03:39,738
Rym: No, like half a pound or a pound each.

50
00:03:40,505 --> 00:03:42,200
Scott: So like the kind of block you would buy in the grocery.

51
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,655
Rym: Yeah, like a grocery store block, but that's a lot of free cheese.

52
00:03:44,695 --> 00:03:49,397
Rym: when I get free cheese It's always like a tiny free cheese and Boar's Head is like middle-of-the-road cheese.

53
00:03:49,417 --> 00:03:58,288
Rym: So We were so skeptical that we engaged in like a minutes worth of conversation like, okay This is free.

54
00:03:58,308 --> 00:04:00,140
Rym: You're just giving me this cheese.

55
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,907
Scott: Alright, where did this cheese come from?

56
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:03,811
Rym: Sure.

57
00:04:03,831 --> 00:04:05,658
Rym: And then later on we finally get her food.

58
00:04:05,698 --> 00:04:10,998
Rym: as we're leaving I see them walk up to this lady and they're like free cheese and they gave her way better cheese than they gave us.

59
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:16,899
Rym: and She was like, no, no, no, no, no, and they're like, it's free and she's like and she was just as scap as we were.

60
00:04:17,481 --> 00:04:20,613
Scott: Yeah, you got a better way to give away your free cheese.

61
00:04:20,653 --> 00:04:29,220
Scott: then just walk up to people with a Santa hat But I noticed behind them they had giant boxes of cheese and you should also give people a reason you're giving them free cheese.

62
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,951
Rym: Oh, the reason was Christmas in July.

63
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:32,380
Scott: That's not a good reason.

64
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,075
Scott: Where do they get a money to buy all that cheese?

65
00:04:34,095 --> 00:04:34,640
Scott: for no reason?

66
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:44,080
Rym: so in the background I see one of the employees is standing there looking at another one and they have one of these giant boxes Of cheese open and I see tons more boxes that are obviously cheese.

67
00:04:44,341 --> 00:04:44,704
Scott: Where did that?

68
00:04:44,764 --> 00:04:45,811
Scott: where did the boxes come from?

69
00:04:45,892 --> 00:04:46,980
Rym: and one of them is like them?

70
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:52,500
Rym: So you're just giving away all this cheese and the other employee just laughs and is like Christmas in July.

71
00:04:54,309 --> 00:04:57,049
Scott: So Was it a mistake in delivery?

72
00:04:57,149 --> 00:04:58,375
Scott: Was it stolen cheese?

73
00:04:58,415 --> 00:04:59,400
Scott: Was it mafia cheese?

74
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,372
Scott: So on the person who owns Russo's just so wealthy.

75
00:05:02,412 --> 00:05:05,185
Scott: They bought you that much though on the B. Why cheese?

76
00:05:05,225 --> 00:05:06,733
Scott: you could have bought something better than she.

77
00:05:06,753 --> 00:05:18,259
Rym: when I go for my run There's one group of people that are set up on the beach, you know, but they're like beach towels and everything but the beach towels all have snowmen on them and they put up Christmas lights and shit.

78
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:31,859
Rym: and Then while we're laying on the beach Parade drove by in cars on the beach of a bunch of bro-looking people playing Christmas songs and singing Christmas carols while wearing swimsuits and Santa hats.

79
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:34,444
Rym: and Apparently it was just.

80
00:05:34,644 --> 00:05:49,348
Rym: it was Christmas in July in Wildwood and I can only assume that the cities of Wildwood's just gave all the businesses incentives to do Christmas in July or something and We just came home and gave all the cheese.

81
00:05:49,368 --> 00:05:49,690
Rym: Let's go to.

82
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:52,947
Rym: his parents were like, hey, we bought you some cheese for the house Thanks for letting us stay here.

83
00:05:52,967 --> 00:05:53,893
Rym: and they were like, oh, thanks.

84
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:54,678
Rym: They were really excited.

85
00:05:56,745 --> 00:05:58,700
Rym: Hey, it was free, you know his parents.

86
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,564
Scott: Yes, you chose.

87
00:05:59,765 --> 00:06:02,960
Scott: you went shopping to buy me a present and you bought three blocks of cheese.

88
00:06:03,422 --> 00:06:05,691
Rym: I think if I gave them anything they would be excited.

89
00:06:05,731 --> 00:06:07,900
Rym: if nothing else they try to sell it at that garage sale.

90
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:10,934
Scott: I'm just saying to be like if someone came up to me.

91
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,360
Scott: It was like got your present three blocks of cheese.

92
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,879
Scott: They'd be like, where did you get this free cheese for?

93
00:06:15,043 --> 00:06:18,579
Rym: We were like Russo's and they were like we got it from Russo's for you and they were like awesome Thanks.

94
00:06:18,881 --> 00:06:25,859
Rym: and then she immediately caught one of them up to like feed Kaylee make a snack for herself and kept the other two because That was that was how that went down.

95
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:31,153
Rym: And Okay, yeah, I believe me I am.

96
00:06:31,555 --> 00:06:35,394
Rym: it's interesting watching New Yorkers interact with any human being.

97
00:06:35,414 --> 00:06:50,279
Rym: whoever talks to them especially offering something like my shields are so strong at this point that a literal like magical godlike Savior of humanity could come down do magic in front of me and offer me gold and I would be like.

98
00:06:52,462 --> 00:06:53,827
Rym: I don't really want to talk to you.

99
00:06:53,967 --> 00:06:54,449
Rym: Mr.

100
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:55,171
Rym: Avoiding.

101
00:06:55,271 --> 00:06:57,800
Rym: I can't act like trying to get around them in the street.

102
00:06:59,005 --> 00:06:59,696
Rym: Yeah, got any news.

103
00:07:01,881 --> 00:07:07,620
Scott: So I guess the news of the day is that Verizon bought Yahoo's core business.

104
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,124
Scott: So what does that even fucking mean?

105
00:07:09,305 --> 00:07:14,680
Rym: once valued at a hundred and twenty five billion like Yahoo's web assets were sold to Verizon for?

106
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,030
Rym: 4.8 billion, right?

107
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:26,860
Scott: So Yahoo the US company Consisted of a a bunch of internet shit like Yahoo Sports Yahoo weather Yahoo websites Yahoo Finance flicker etc.

108
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,442
Scott: Etc.

109
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:33,188
Scott: right it consisted of an investment in Alibaba Like 15% of Alibaba.

110
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:38,232
Rym: Yeah no, you guys gonna realize how incestuous all these companies actually are.

111
00:07:38,272 --> 00:07:45,634
Scott: like a lot of companies own big chumps like when you buy if you buy a Percent of Yahoo, you're actually buying one over 15% of Alibaba.

112
00:07:48,141 --> 00:07:55,629
Scott: Anyway, so it also Yahoo US owns 35 and a half percent of Yahoo Japan Which is actually a separate company.

113
00:07:55,669 --> 00:07:56,756
Scott: that's actually successful.

114
00:07:57,098 --> 00:08:10,232
Scott: Yep So basically all the parts of Yahoo America us that weren't Investments and other things that were just web stuff God sold to Verizon for like five billion dollars.

115
00:08:10,252 --> 00:08:20,655
Rym: Apparently they tried to include the Alibaba stuff And the only reason they couldn't according to these articles is that they were afraid they'd pay more taxes if they did So anyway, so Yahoo is basically split into two parts.

116
00:08:20,936 --> 00:08:32,086
Scott: one is just a company That's nothing but investments like all right like a holding company and the other part is the operating company Which like he does things like software and websites Which is the part that Verizon bought.

117
00:08:32,486 --> 00:08:37,337
Scott: and Verizon already bought AOL for a similar amount You know a while ago.

118
00:08:38,042 --> 00:08:43,919
Scott: So and you think just the web part of AOL and just the part of Yahoo that actually do internet stuff, right?

119
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:48,660
Scott: Like Yahoo mail AOL mail pretty equivalent in value pretty close, right?

120
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:53,940
Rym: Yeah, but if there is one company I trusted the least to do anything with those assets is Verizon.

121
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,530
Scott: Well, I mean not the least but it's way down there.

122
00:08:57,011 --> 00:08:59,340
Scott: Yeah, it's not a highly trusted operation.

123
00:09:00,661 --> 00:09:03,108
Scott: So Yeah, that's probably bad.

124
00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:06,601
Scott: if you use any Yahoo things and I actually use a few Yahoo things I'm

125
00:09:06,661 --> 00:09:20,116
Rym: probably the one that the only one that I actually worry about is flicker because flicker is like the core of my photograph sharing and archiving technology Mmm, like I use flicker like as my 100% core workflow.

126
00:09:21,902 --> 00:09:27,580
Rym: I process stuff through Lightroom, but in the end the actual photos I put them all on flicker because that's how I share them.

127
00:09:27,641 --> 00:09:28,456
Rym: That's what I use it for.

128
00:09:29,182 --> 00:09:34,340
Scott: I highly doubt they'll kill it, but it could be like Verizon flicker and it could you know could just get bad.

129
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,070
Scott: It'd be covered in ads and turn shitty.

130
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:36,492
Scott: Who knows?

131
00:09:36,733 --> 00:09:37,779
Scott: Yeah, there's other options.

132
00:09:38,463 --> 00:09:41,175
Rym: The only the only thing is all the stuff that's happened over the years.

133
00:09:41,215 --> 00:09:43,704
Rym: flickers just remained Mostly running.

134
00:09:43,744 --> 00:09:49,369
Rym: it has some problems like occasionally old photos just won't load for a while And then they float again like a couple days later.

135
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:50,354
Scott: I never seen that.

136
00:09:50,394 --> 00:09:51,700
Rym: a lot of people complain about that.

137
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,353
Rym: That's a really common problem that's been going on for a couple years now.

138
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:55,860
Scott: You can always use smug mug.

139
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:56,503
Scott: It's not free.

140
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:58,090
Rym: But you know this Lakers not free.

141
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:03,736
Scott: this I mean, but it's a way, you know, there's a lot of choices Yeah, but flicker is the best of them still so far.

142
00:10:04,038 --> 00:10:06,220
Rym: Sure Let's see how this all goes down.

143
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:12,680
Rym: This is a situation where I would be much more worried about the antitrust and neutrality aspects of this?

144
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,342
Scott: No, I'm not.

145
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:21,329
Rym: well see the thing is yeah, I am worried would be if Yahoo wasn't already like this sinking ship Well tethered to another.

146
00:10:21,409 --> 00:10:21,530
Scott: I'm.

147
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:26,890
Scott: obviously if I was in charge of antitrust I wouldn't allow this but they already allowed NBC Comcast.

148
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,498
Scott: So it's like well, this is way less bad than that.

149
00:10:29,819 --> 00:10:31,121
Scott: So Really?

150
00:10:31,162 --> 00:10:37,868
Scott: They should not allow a company period any corporation in the United States or anywhere to do more than one thing Period.

151
00:10:38,051 --> 00:10:40,643
Scott: that's how it would be One thing.

152
00:10:40,844 --> 00:10:46,840
Scott: well, for example, if you're McDonald's you sell you you make food and sell food, right?

153
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,511
Rym: What if I make video games and social media software?

154
00:10:49,852 --> 00:10:50,836
Scott: No, you shouldn't be allowed to do that.

155
00:10:50,856 --> 00:10:51,660
Rym: What's the difference?

156
00:10:52,603 --> 00:10:52,964
Scott: What do you mean?

157
00:10:52,984 --> 00:10:53,466
Scott: what's the difference?

158
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,034
Scott: what's the difference between making two different kinds of things?

159
00:10:56,295 --> 00:10:57,920
Rym: what defines what a kind of thing is?

160
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,167
Rym: It's just software Me.

161
00:11:00,187 --> 00:11:00,268
Scott: Okay.

162
00:11:00,551 --> 00:11:05,377
Scott: Yeah businesses You can't make clothing and food.

163
00:11:06,381 --> 00:11:07,123
Rym: It's so different.

164
00:11:07,284 --> 00:11:12,660
Rym: self-driving cars because that requires lots of software that is also used for very very different things.

165
00:11:13,723 --> 00:11:16,634
Scott: You're basically saying because this is semantic issue of defining.

166
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:17,478
Scott: What's a different thing?

167
00:11:17,498 --> 00:11:20,099
Scott: You're gonna get it you're gonna let it stop you from.

168
00:11:21,286 --> 00:11:23,402
Scott: You know the common-sense definition of what.

169
00:11:23,523 --> 00:11:33,560
Rym: I would go much more simply and say that mergers of companies that are above a certain size are met with extreme Skepticism and the more disparate their assets are the higher the bar.

170
00:11:33,821 --> 00:11:42,985
Scott: I can actually even go so far as to say we should not allow a company to exist with assets greater than X Period and it's a company becomes greater than X Even if it does only one thing

171
00:11:43,065 --> 00:11:44,229
Rym: how to pull split

172
00:11:44,249 --> 00:11:46,256
Scott: it into two companies that both do the counter

173
00:11:46,316 --> 00:11:46,677
Rym: point.

174
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:52,120
Rym: a lot of the Things we use probably would never been created if there weren't companies that had that much asset under control.

175
00:11:53,141 --> 00:11:57,520
Rym: Maybe maybe not like a lot of the good lot a lot of stuff Google did we really just never been done ever?

176
00:11:58,022 --> 00:11:58,745
Scott: Maybe maybe not?

177
00:11:58,845 --> 00:12:02,239
Rym: probably not not unless you had governments doing it and you know, that's not gonna happen.

178
00:12:02,747 --> 00:12:06,269
Rym: I'm okay, you know You never know just saying you're uh, you're overly simplistic.

179
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:12,280
Rym: views on this are in contrast with my much more nuanced views And more nuanced view isn't necessarily better.

180
00:12:13,582 --> 00:12:16,159
Rym: You you fall to the folly of the shortest path.

181
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,324
Scott: Shortest path is a quick path.

182
00:12:18,545 --> 00:12:24,160
Rym: Yeah quick path to the opposite of salvation either literal damnation or suicide.

183
00:12:26,082 --> 00:12:30,819
Rym: Well, we'll see welcome we're reading the Prince of Nothing books again, so watch out for they just made a new one.

184
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,807
Scott: I Took a short path right to the end of that book.

185
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,800
Scott: I'm I got there faster than Rym with my short path.

186
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:42,768
Rym: I took a shorter path because I didn't even read orgs and Craig because I was reading this first But instead of finishing the book at the beach.

187
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,755
Rym: I just laid there at the beach.

188
00:12:44,795 --> 00:12:47,359
Rym: So I embraced the zero guy For a little while.

189
00:12:49,642 --> 00:12:53,977
Rym: So you're damned as well, this is a totally side news, but remembers it.

190
00:12:53,997 --> 00:12:54,580
Rym: remembers of car?

191
00:12:55,263 --> 00:12:57,839
Scott: They're still around I guess but they have a lot of competition now.

192
00:12:58,201 --> 00:13:01,410
Rym: Yeah, so I've decided like I haven't used that car in a while.

193
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:02,914
Scott: He's still paying the fee.

194
00:13:03,095 --> 00:13:03,697
Rym: Well, the fee is $70 a year.

195
00:13:05,362 --> 00:13:07,472
Rym: So it's basically nothing but nothing.

196
00:13:07,492 --> 00:13:13,299
Rym: that's a whole video game a brand To video games, but I was paying for it because I used it.

197
00:13:14,463 --> 00:13:18,835
Rym: But I haven't used it at all this year and I'm gonna cancel it like tonight.

198
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,780
Rym: like I decided a zip car is fucking dead.

199
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,953
Rym: Yeah, and the reason is zip car is literally worthless.

200
00:13:25,053 --> 00:13:27,200
Rym: It is worse than every other option now.

201
00:13:27,843 --> 00:13:34,655
Rym: So the reasons I used to use zip car were one I don't want to talk to human beings and deal with them trying to sell me bullshit.

202
00:13:34,735 --> 00:13:41,137
Rym: I just want to rent a car Yeah, - I just want to know a set price of what the car takes and just go pick it up with technology.

203
00:13:41,357 --> 00:13:41,979
Rym: Mm-hmm three.

204
00:13:43,542 --> 00:13:47,899
Rym: I pretty much want to pick up a car near my house Like I'll go to my house pick up the car.

205
00:13:48,323 --> 00:13:50,502
Rym: That way I can rent it for the exact period of time I need.

206
00:13:50,523 --> 00:13:56,392
Rym: it's like I pick it up Friday after work drive to the beach I drop it off Sunday at like 10 o'clock at night and I only pay for that time.

207
00:13:56,412 --> 00:13:58,499
Rym: Mm-hmm, and that was great.

208
00:13:59,282 --> 00:14:04,358
Rym: But and back then it was cheaper than rental cars or at least the same cost as a rental car.

209
00:14:04,418 --> 00:14:11,740
Rym: free gas Yeah or it caused more than rental car but the free gas and all the other things evened it out or the Convenience was worth the slight difference in price.

210
00:14:12,642 --> 00:14:16,420
Rym: Over the last couple years the prices of zip car have gotten up to where you know what?

211
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:26,404
Rym: It would have cost for me to rent the cheapest possible zip car for the weekend last weekend to go to Wildwood hundreds four hundred and seventy eight dollars Mm-hmm.

212
00:14:26,425 --> 00:14:32,609
Rym: So now outside of New York, I could rent a car for the weekend for like Sixty bucks, but it's New York.

213
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,517
Rym: So the cheapest I could get was 200 bucks.

214
00:14:35,844 --> 00:14:42,300
Rym: The problem is if I rent from a non zip car place You have to rent it from somewhere that won't let you drop it off on Sunday.

215
00:14:42,421 --> 00:14:45,920
Rym: No, no rental car place will let you get a rental that ends on Sunday.

216
00:14:46,463 --> 00:14:57,618
Rym: So you pretty much have to keep it till Monday and then drop it off Mm-hmm, but getting the car like Friday afternoon to Monday morning from like White Plains was Basically half the price of a zip car.

217
00:14:58,302 --> 00:15:01,739
Rym: So I took the train up to White Plains picked up the car picked up Emily because her office is up there.

218
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:08,859
Rym: Drove to Wildwood family's office when Emily get the car Because I drive a lot more than her and I don't think she really wanted to drive the car.

219
00:15:09,169 --> 00:15:09,398
Rym: Mm-hmm.

220
00:15:09,601 --> 00:15:12,620
Rym: I mean most of our friends in New York like Judith doesn't even know how to drive.

221
00:15:13,002 --> 00:15:15,380
Scott: Why don't you just take the train to Jersey and get a car?

222
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:19,780
Rym: I thought about that and it ended up being much more a pain in the ass for a bunch of traffic reasons.

223
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,379
Scott: You just take the path train then get a car.

224
00:15:21,571 --> 00:15:23,488
Rym: Yeah We did that once and actually it took.

225
00:15:23,629 --> 00:15:29,874
Rym: it ended up taking way longer than what we did now Mm-hmm because I could skirt New York City to a surprising degree from coming from the.

226
00:15:29,914 --> 00:15:36,760
Rym: but anyway in the month in the Monday morning I drove Emily to work and then I just dropped the car off like at North White Plains And then I took the train to work and I worked out fine.

227
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:43,744
Rym: But I think what killed zip car is that one remember zip car got bought I didn't forget watch Which rental car company owns them.

228
00:15:44,606 --> 00:15:46,612
Rym: and once that happens zip car just kind of sucks.

229
00:15:46,953 --> 00:15:56,652
Rym: and it got worse and worse and worse - Zip car wanted to be sold to people who live in cities who don't own a car But occasionally need to use a car to like do something.

230
00:15:56,652 --> 00:16:00,539
Rym: 90% of those use cases are now covered by uber.

231
00:16:01,643 --> 00:16:03,079
Scott: Uber is not gonna take you to the beach though

232
00:16:03,328 --> 00:16:11,666
Rym: No but zip car wanted to sell zip car to the kinds of people like their business model was basically a Shit version of what uber does now like

233
00:16:12,068 --> 00:16:12,309
Scott: anyone

234
00:16:12,329 --> 00:16:14,838
Rym: who would use a zip car for the business model zip car had.

235
00:16:14,858 --> 00:16:16,437
Rym: now We'll just use uber.

236
00:16:17,221 --> 00:16:20,231
Rym: Everyone who had zip car actually used it the way we used it of.

237
00:16:20,472 --> 00:16:25,010
Rym: we actually just want to rent cars like a normal car Rental and they can't make money with that.

238
00:16:25,472 --> 00:16:27,220
Rym: So I think zip car is just completely fucked.

239
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,149
Scott: The thing is we need uber long, right?

240
00:16:30,209 --> 00:16:30,390
Scott: I don't.

241
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:33,120
Scott: yeah, I would never take a car to go somewhere short.

242
00:16:33,301 --> 00:16:39,167
Scott: I don't only take a car to go somewhere in another town, but an uber is not gonna take me to like Pennsylvania.

243
00:16:39,329 --> 00:16:40,180
Rym: it's like cars on demand.

244
00:16:40,301 --> 00:16:49,495
Rym: I want an uber where someone drives a car to my apartment at a certain time Leaves it with me and then comes to pick the car back up on another date at another time.

245
00:16:49,515 --> 00:16:50,097
Rym: Hmm.

246
00:16:50,298 --> 00:16:51,687
Rym: That's what I want That's not bad.

247
00:16:51,869 --> 00:16:52,779
Rym: Yeah, that would actually be great.

248
00:16:53,523 --> 00:16:59,643
Rym: So uber killed zip car and while zip car still exists Beware you who use it.

249
00:16:59,663 --> 00:17:11,746
Rym: It is basically worthless at this point and it's interesting how that like the use case like a use case that a huge number of pretty affluent people in a major city have is Literally not served.

250
00:17:11,766 --> 00:17:25,060
Rym: like there is no solution for people like us It is literally go to a shitto place like Hertz and go through the normal garbage Terrible process talking to human beings and dealing with the crap or buy a car and pay to park it somewhere every month.

251
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:28,534
Rym: Yep, so if we used a rental car if we used a zip car.

252
00:17:28,554 --> 00:17:30,060
Rym: with the current prices four times a year.

253
00:17:30,381 --> 00:17:37,189
Rym: It's cheaper to own a car even with paying for the hundred fifty bucks a month for parking and the insurance And everything and the maintenance.

254
00:17:37,229 --> 00:17:37,450
Scott: Yep.

255
00:17:37,912 --> 00:17:38,615
Rym: I did the van.

256
00:17:38,656 --> 00:17:39,479
Scott: It's a really nice car.

257
00:17:39,822 --> 00:17:43,747
Rym: I know it'd be it could be a crappy car Who cares like some used piece of crap.

258
00:17:44,109 --> 00:17:51,540
Rym: actually if I did that I'd probably get like a minivan Because then we can bring all our friends to places and it actually would be really worthwhile.

259
00:17:51,881 --> 00:17:58,900
Rym: Why not get like, you know, one of those I can't can't have more than like 12 seats Or then it doesn't count as a consumer van.

260
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,300
Scott: I'm saying like that, you know the church van where it's like three benches and can fit a ton of people.

261
00:18:03,844 --> 00:18:04,589
Rym: Oh, I see what you're thinking.

262
00:18:04,609 --> 00:18:05,717
Rym: Just why don't we just get a school bus?

263
00:18:07,842 --> 00:18:10,340
Rym: They get like one mile per gallon, I guess that's the problem.

264
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:12,848
Scott: You need a special license to drive.

265
00:18:12,888 --> 00:18:14,093
Rym: that I could get that license.

266
00:18:14,114 --> 00:18:15,359
Rym: I think is C license or whatever.

267
00:18:16,904 --> 00:18:23,779
Rym: But if we get regular rental cars We would have to use a rental car like 14 times a year and then it's cheaper to own the car.

268
00:18:24,181 --> 00:18:27,034
Rym: I don't think we use them 14 times a year more like four.

269
00:18:27,295 --> 00:18:31,273
Rym: Yeah, thus Zip cars dead in other news.

270
00:18:31,293 --> 00:18:31,634
Rym: Let's see.

271
00:18:31,654 --> 00:18:32,880
Rym: What other tech news did we have?

272
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:36,959
Rym: So something interesting is happening with the EU.

273
00:18:37,682 --> 00:19:17,165
Rym: The European Union is going to basically pay to have its own engineers Like the government that the the people who do like security auditing are going to do an audit of Apache and key pass specifically, okay The rationale is that those two open source or open projects are used very widely Both by government agencies and the private sector and also just the public and they decided that it would be a public good to use taxpayer money to have an independent body of Professionals audit and check on the security of those things and generate a report and work with both of those projects to make them better From a security standpoint.

274
00:19:17,185 --> 00:19:19,393
Rym: All right, this is kind of amazing.

275
00:19:19,433 --> 00:19:21,080
Rym: It's kind of it's actually gonna be a really good thing.

276
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,244
Scott: They're open source things.

277
00:19:22,284 --> 00:19:22,906
Scott: do whatever you want.

278
00:19:23,167 --> 00:19:27,120
Rym: Yeah, but it's I don't know if this has ever happened before.

279
00:19:27,321 --> 00:19:40,668
Rym: I think the only times that I can find evidence of a government entity doing auditing of open source software is If they're auditing a specific use of that software within another company Se Linux.

280
00:19:41,819 --> 00:19:42,442
Rym: Oh Yeah, but who?

281
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:43,927
Rym: who audited that specifically?

282
00:19:43,967 --> 00:19:44,650
Rym: and where's the report?

283
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:47,560
Scott: It's the NSA's version of the Linux kernel.

284
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:52,433
Rym: Yeah, but I'm saying where's when's the last like independent audit of its security?

285
00:19:52,513 --> 00:19:53,335
Rym: It's continuous.

286
00:19:53,376 --> 00:19:53,857
Scott: It doesn't end.

287
00:19:53,897 --> 00:19:54,680
Scott: they do it all the time.

288
00:19:54,921 --> 00:19:55,927
Rym: It's is there a report.

289
00:19:56,027 --> 00:19:56,872
Rym: It's a living me to it.

290
00:19:56,892 --> 00:19:58,100
Scott: I don't know if they have a report.

291
00:19:58,341 --> 00:20:02,320
Scott: It's like yeah, this is the NSA has a fork of Linux that they continuously maintain.

292
00:20:02,481 --> 00:20:04,531
Rym: Yeah, and probably put holes in for us to get.

293
00:20:04,551 --> 00:20:06,200
Rym: did you trust the NSA hundred percent?

294
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,640
Scott: Se Linux is like the real deal.

295
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,676
Rym: Well se Linux is the thing that most bullshit most Linux people who are system administrators.

296
00:20:14,776 --> 00:20:16,321
Rym: in my experience open source It's not.

297
00:20:16,362 --> 00:20:16,823
Scott: there's no.

298
00:20:17,044 --> 00:20:24,360
Rym: most people I know and like every company I've ever like looked at their servers Se Linux is disabled because someone runs into a problem.

299
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,713
Rym: It doesn't know how to fix it and the solution on like some garbage stack exchange.

300
00:20:27,773 --> 00:20:29,540
Rym: answer is just turn se Linux off.

301
00:20:29,781 --> 00:20:34,718
Scott: Yeah, the real answer is the software that you're trying to run on that secure kernel is not secure.

302
00:20:35,826 --> 00:20:37,259
Scott: Edit that software to make it secure.

303
00:20:37,621 --> 00:20:39,347
Rym: Actually, I found 90% of the time.

304
00:20:39,407 --> 00:20:42,477
Rym: the real reason was your clock is off and I see Linux freaks out.

305
00:20:42,557 --> 00:20:44,365
Rym: if timestamps are messed Up, it's also her problem.

306
00:20:44,385 --> 00:20:48,978
Rym: That's like the movie that nine times out of ten if se Linux doesn't work It's because you didn't set up NTP.

307
00:20:49,842 --> 00:21:00,968
Rym: Anyway, but this is cool and it kind of lets, you know, a lot of people in General especially lately because they're you know people getting their Twitter hacked or whatever They want.

308
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,780
Scott: anyone says something was hacked.

309
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:04,310
Rym: It really means you had terrible password.

310
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,840
Scott: someone guessed your stupid password.

311
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:06,943
Scott: Yeah You told it to some.

312
00:21:07,064 --> 00:21:15,592
Scott: or you use the same password on multiple sites or you like you clicked Oh off Yes on something stupid and gave permission to some app to use your shit.

313
00:21:15,712 --> 00:21:15,953
Rym: Yep.

314
00:21:16,414 --> 00:21:22,950
Rym: Now there are password managers and You probably shouldn't use them because while I don't

315
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:26,539
Scott: use anything that stores my password even in an encrypted fashion

316
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:33,801
Rym: now Theoretically a good way to do that would be to have local encryption only of your passwords that are not known to any human in The world.

317
00:21:33,842 --> 00:21:39,680
Rym: sure and the problem is you have to trust the organization that made that software that you run locally, right?

318
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:46,720
Scott: As soon as you store your password, even if it's encrypted You're basically the whole point of a password the password from something, you know into something you have pretty much.

319
00:21:47,143 --> 00:21:48,110
Scott: So you're basically now you.

320
00:21:48,231 --> 00:21:53,697
Scott: even if you use two-factor auth It's something you have and something else you have and someone else can just steal and take the to have.

321
00:21:53,717 --> 00:22:01,300
Rym: but if you're gonna do Something like that key pass is probably the best one to use because it is not like last pass or any of those things.

322
00:22:01,622 --> 00:22:04,160
Rym: It is just in it a little encrypted database.

323
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,268
Rym: You can put things in and you could you.

324
00:22:06,288 --> 00:22:07,714
Rym: just you keep it and you manage it.

325
00:22:08,055 --> 00:22:10,919
Rym: never sends your shit anywhere Mm-hmm, so you can go into it.

326
00:22:11,201 --> 00:22:17,025
Rym: like you can have a super complex password and if you somehow forget it or like you have a crazy password for how you use that often.

327
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:25,193
Rym: key pass is so reliable that a lot of Security audit types use it in real organizations and governments use it.

328
00:22:25,473 --> 00:22:27,580
Scott: just use fucking pass phrases.

329
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:31,034
Scott: They're it's they're easy to remember because just a bunch of words.

330
00:22:31,054 --> 00:22:32,340
Rym: So, you know what I use key pass for.

331
00:22:32,905 --> 00:22:48,143
Rym: I don't put my passwords in it but I put other information that I'd like to be confidential because TrueCrypt kind of died as a project and it's a nice way to Have an encrypted container and the only way to unlock mine is both to type in a passphrase and to plug my yubi key into My computer.

332
00:22:48,163 --> 00:22:50,435
Scott: but I'm saying if you need for passwords.

333
00:22:50,455 --> 00:22:52,142
Scott: just use pass phrases You can remember.

334
00:22:52,243 --> 00:22:58,060
Scott: it's hard to remember like ABC 1 2 XY something capital lowercase weird symbol, right?

335
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:04,680
Scott: It's hard to remember but it's easy to remember like a whole sentence Right, like the brown the lazy Fox jumped over the dog or whatever.

336
00:23:04,901 --> 00:23:09,440
Scott: Yeah, and it's like that's a crazy fucking long password and it's easy as hell to remember.

337
00:23:09,743 --> 00:23:11,460
Rym: How many of you remember the correct horse battery?

338
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,905
Scott: Exactly something like that.

339
00:23:14,085 --> 00:23:20,285
Scott: Yeah, so you just use something like that for every different place you log into and You'll be crazy secure.

340
00:23:20,306 --> 00:23:27,300
Scott: No one will ever guess you're really ridiculously long password But you'll remember it without even needing any kind of encryption or any kind of help whatsoever.

341
00:23:28,341 --> 00:23:28,943
Scott: And that's it.

342
00:23:29,023 --> 00:23:30,166
Scott: pass phrases to the king.

343
00:23:30,207 --> 00:23:30,929
Scott: fuck everything else.

344
00:23:31,571 --> 00:23:33,657
Rym: and last but not least the Linux kernel 4 7 was released.

345
00:23:34,881 --> 00:23:38,560
Rym: That's actual tech news according to scout and everyone's talk about all this non tech news.

346
00:23:39,122 --> 00:23:42,110
Scott: It's only news if they did something in that release of significance.

347
00:23:42,532 --> 00:23:44,337
Rym: All right, let's see what was increased.

348
00:23:44,397 --> 00:23:45,260
Scott: What a great news.

349
00:23:46,181 --> 00:23:48,307
Scott: Support for arbitrary number went up.

350
00:23:48,788 --> 00:23:51,857
Rym: support for radion rx 480 GPUs.

351
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:52,820
Scott: You got one of those.

352
00:23:53,201 --> 00:23:54,144
Rym: No, who cares?

353
00:23:54,164 --> 00:23:55,027
Rym: It's radio.

354
00:23:55,047 --> 00:23:55,850
Rym: It's AMD.

355
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:57,234
Rym: No one wants those.

356
00:23:57,415 --> 00:23:58,880
Rym: Why do you send video guys?

357
00:23:59,961 --> 00:24:04,377
Rym: Let's see load pin which makes modules load by the kernel or just in files.

358
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:09,254
Rym: Okay, whatever Generating virtual USB device controllers and USB IP.

359
00:24:09,274 --> 00:24:16,540
Rym: All right Sync file fencing mechanisms used in Android mobile operating systems.

360
00:24:17,183 --> 00:24:27,100
Rym: Berkeley packet filter programs can attach to trace four points schedule till frequency governor to the CPU freak dynamic frequency scaling subsystem.

361
00:24:28,183 --> 00:24:29,493
Rym: None of this matters to 99% of humans.

362
00:24:31,364 --> 00:24:32,318
Scott: Ninety nine point nine nine.

363
00:24:33,525 --> 00:24:34,338
Scott: I'm presenting humans.

364
00:24:34,701 --> 00:24:38,355
Rym: What's funny is the GPU stuff is interesting because that only matters.

365
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:39,540
Scott: any humans is a lot of humans.

366
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:48,852
Rym: But the GPU and so like that only matters to people who are running Linux on the desktop and want a GPU To use this GPU stuff on the desktop.

367
00:24:48,872 --> 00:24:59,531
Scott: could be someone somewhere who's using AMD to do like some CUDA processing project or something because they didn't buy in video maybe but I don't know if this driver Necessarily helps with that.

368
00:24:59,854 --> 00:25:00,459
Scott: I don't know either.

369
00:25:01,512 --> 00:25:02,059
Scott: No one cares.

370
00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:08,120
Scott: The one person who has that video card and wants to run Linux on it is really excited.

371
00:25:08,562 --> 00:25:12,120
Rym: Are any of you the person wrote the driver actually you the listener?

372
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:17,579
Rym: I have a question for you does anything in the Linux for seven kernel in any way?

373
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,525
Rym: Affect you at all.

374
00:25:19,665 --> 00:25:21,691
Rym: If it does I really want to hear from you.

375
00:25:21,952 --> 00:25:33,300
Scott: It might matter to some Android people's, you know, eventually Yeah, maybe in a way they won't realize It's just most good uses of Linux these days are servers not so much desktops.

376
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,988
Scott: Well, I mean Linux runs everything these days.

377
00:25:36,109 --> 00:25:38,376
Scott: Oh, yeah, it's not running but it's not a desktop.

378
00:25:38,476 --> 00:25:39,480
Scott: It pretty much runs Linux.

379
00:25:39,963 --> 00:25:51,229
Scott: yeah, unless it's an iOS device and You know not just servers like literally every device that isn't a Windows desktop or an Apple devices or legacy device Which is like old Windows is running Linux.

380
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:58,939
Scott: So, you know the changes of the kernel that affect all those devices But they're invisible to all human beings Except the ones working on.

381
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:09,595
Rym: but anyway things of the day All right, so I'm just gonna.

382
00:26:09,656 --> 00:26:12,006
Scott: I couldn't actually have any things of the day cuz I've been.

383
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:14,329
Scott: yeah There weren't really any good things of the day going on.

384
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:22,770
Scott: so just do a self-indulgent thing of the day the kind of thing that usually I You'd like on YouTube and then don't make a thing of the day cuz I'm like, yeah That's just a thing that I like not a thing of the day.

385
00:26:22,871 --> 00:26:31,969
Scott: But recently like a week ago or so Whereas the alternative press music awards a music award show even crappier than like the Grammys.

386
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:39,122
Scott: yeah, somehow is that if there's even possible an award show where literally no one cares and Really you won one of these awards.

387
00:26:39,202 --> 00:26:40,008
Scott: No one gives a shit.

388
00:26:40,652 --> 00:26:52,586
Scott: But as award shows are like to do especially musical ones There are performances there and at this award show There is a performance of babymetal on stage with Rob Halford.

389
00:26:52,606 --> 00:26:55,429
Scott: If you don't know who that is That's the Judas Priest guy.

390
00:26:56,252 --> 00:26:57,138
Scott: It's breaking the law.

391
00:26:57,158 --> 00:26:58,889
Scott: Yeah, and they broke all the laws.

392
00:26:59,552 --> 00:27:02,442
Scott: So watch this video and see all the laws be broken.

393
00:27:02,462 --> 00:27:03,224
Scott: Nice.

394
00:27:03,405 --> 00:27:13,070
Scott: What's really freaky is You know like in babymetal There's three girls the one who can actually sing and the two that pretty much just dance and make cute noises, right?

395
00:27:13,691 --> 00:27:18,410
Scott: So the two cute noises ones didn't really have a lot to do on this kind of stage.

396
00:27:19,172 --> 00:27:25,250
Scott: So they had them come out with these tiny guitars that were really even more cute.

397
00:27:26,468 --> 00:27:34,687
Scott: and The thing is if you watch the video It looks like they're maybe actually playing them possibly.

398
00:27:34,707 --> 00:27:36,364
Rym: Oh That's interesting.

399
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:44,983
Scott: I mean, they're probably turned way down on the mixer board so they don't fuck anything up But it really looks like they're playing it.

400
00:27:45,043 --> 00:27:52,853
Scott: You know, usually you can tell like yeah They're just pretending to play which is see the thing is everyone expected them to be pretending to play Video like.

401
00:27:52,873 --> 00:27:57,547
Scott: it almost looks like they're playing and they're actually have little wires coming out going to wireless packs.

402
00:27:57,567 --> 00:27:59,816
Rym: good modern Videos of things like.

403
00:27:59,856 --> 00:28:02,870
Rym: it's especially just a real band where people actually do play their instruments normally.

404
00:28:03,051 --> 00:28:11,182
Rym: But this is live streamed on like Amazon live stream Yeah, so when they're doing a live show that can't be fucked up like, you know Like some bands will do a live show.

405
00:28:11,202 --> 00:28:12,069
Rym: they do a real live show.

406
00:28:12,471 --> 00:28:18,838
Rym: But if you're doing the live show at like the Olympics or something or the halftime They're not gonna risk like something bad happening.

407
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:22,490
Rym: So usually they'll actually be playing the songs on the instruments.

408
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:25,490
Rym: They're just not that and music isn't going anyway, right?

409
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:29,910
Scott: But even if they were doing that the surprise is they know how to play.

410
00:28:30,553 --> 00:28:33,590
Rym: I guess I kind of expected that from them because they seem very earnest.

411
00:28:33,831 --> 00:28:39,005
Scott: I think it's a thing as you know, Japanese people always practicing too hard and putting in the extra effort.

412
00:28:39,266 --> 00:28:39,868
Rym: It depends.

413
00:28:40,008 --> 00:28:48,410
Rym: I've seen multiple J-pop idol Concerts where the person was literally doing the opposite of even pretending to play.

414
00:28:48,631 --> 00:28:51,283
Rym: They're just like kind of banging their hand against the guitar.

415
00:28:51,464 --> 00:28:51,524
Scott: Yes.

416
00:28:51,645 --> 00:28:55,238
Rym: I have seen that as well I think when what's-her-name got her hair stuck in the guitar.

417
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,964
Scott: Oh that whatever her name was.

418
00:28:56,984 --> 00:28:59,894
Rym: Yeah, Otakon concert That was a long time ago.

419
00:28:59,974 --> 00:29:01,519
Scott: Yeah, I remember who that was.

420
00:29:01,719 --> 00:29:05,270
Rym: So actually surprisingly semi-related my video.

421
00:29:05,551 --> 00:29:09,366
Scott: So whoever made those tiny guitars that are too cute for life.

422
00:29:09,727 --> 00:29:12,013
Scott: Yeah Props to you.

423
00:29:12,515 --> 00:29:18,139
Rym: So if you didn't know this it's actually impossible to tune a piano What?

424
00:29:18,885 --> 00:29:22,617
Scott: Yeah, so No, you can hire people to tune your fucking.

425
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:23,219
Scott: they can't.

426
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:24,343
Rym: they can't.

427
00:29:24,443 --> 00:29:28,787
Rym: they can tune your piano and I'm making quote motions But they cannot tune it evenly.

428
00:29:29,894 --> 00:29:30,939
Rym: If some notes are gonna be.

429
00:29:30,959 --> 00:29:33,030
Scott: there's a bunch of individual strings.

430
00:29:33,552 --> 00:29:35,199
Rym: Yes, that's why it can't be tuned.

431
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,810
Scott: each string makes one specific note.

432
00:29:38,392 --> 00:29:40,061
Rym: That that is why the piano cannot be.

433
00:29:40,081 --> 00:29:41,709
Scott: there is a separate string for every key.

434
00:29:42,713 --> 00:29:44,961
Scott: You say that you make every single string.

435
00:29:45,162 --> 00:29:47,510
Scott: that is the correct string at the correct tension.

436
00:29:47,712 --> 00:29:48,844
Rym: So what is the correct string?

437
00:29:48,884 --> 00:29:49,450
Rym: intention Scott?

438
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,618
Scott: Because the problem is you have a little tuner.

439
00:29:51,638 --> 00:29:54,630
Scott: so say this key is this is you know?

440
00:29:54,750 --> 00:30:02,088
Scott: this middle C and you press it and The same hammer hits the string and you say well was that at the frequency of middle C?

441
00:30:02,188 --> 00:30:03,755
Scott: and you know It was a little bit low free.

442
00:30:03,795 --> 00:30:05,502
Scott: so Scott make it tighter.

443
00:30:05,884 --> 00:30:08,166
Scott: so a little bit high frequency I'll make it looser.

444
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:10,197
Scott: There you go exactly the right frequency.

445
00:30:10,217 --> 00:30:12,686
Scott: when the hammer hit the string that string is in tune.

446
00:30:12,726 --> 00:30:13,830
Scott: you do repeat for every string.

447
00:30:14,032 --> 00:30:15,370
Rym: That's why this video is important.

448
00:30:15,451 --> 00:30:19,679
Rym: So Scott when you watch this video and it's only four minutes long You will find out that you are wrong.

449
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,910
Scott: The strings are not related to each other in any way.

450
00:30:22,171 --> 00:30:24,500
Scott: It is literally just happen to be next to each other.

451
00:30:24,841 --> 00:30:31,350
Rym: with with music and the way music notes work It is impossible to evenly and perfectly tune a piano.

452
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:32,475
Scott: I think this is a bullshit.

453
00:30:32,515 --> 00:30:33,097
Scott: hooks video.

454
00:30:33,961 --> 00:30:35,206
Rym: uh you do I do okay?

455
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:39,218
Scott: Incorrect and against all common sense.

456
00:30:39,699 --> 00:30:42,490
Rym: so when you're you could google around for an evenly.

457
00:30:42,933 --> 00:30:45,170
Scott: It should then be also impossible to tune a guitar.

458
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:46,776
Scott: It's just a piano with a lot less strings.

459
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:49,607
Rym: uh no guitars can be perfectly tuned then why can't not?

460
00:30:49,627 --> 00:30:50,655
Scott: a piano is the same thing.

461
00:30:51,063 --> 00:30:55,537
Rym: you You should Watch this video.

462
00:30:55,557 --> 00:30:56,060
Rym: Uh-huh.

463
00:30:56,241 --> 00:30:57,750
Scott: I have a feeling this video is gonna be full bullshit.

464
00:30:58,132 --> 00:31:07,349
Rym: So there are different ways to tune a piano and basically no matter what the method I just said is the correct method every method will have some keys will be out of tune.

465
00:31:08,811 --> 00:31:15,717
Rym: Sounds to me like you're now the way around that get a new tuning fork in the old days if you want a piano That is perfectly evenly tuned.

466
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:22,592
Rym: that piano is only set up to play in basically one key Mm-hmm.

467
00:31:22,853 --> 00:31:24,741
Rym: yeah like uh you know what Scott.

468
00:31:24,761 --> 00:31:26,730
Rym: watch the video mm-hmm, okay?

469
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:29,015
Rym: I've studied music theory.

470
00:31:29,035 --> 00:31:30,561
Rym: I was a musician.

471
00:31:30,581 --> 00:31:33,350
Rym: I'm not a musician anymore, so I don't play my trumpet for shit.

472
00:31:34,231 --> 00:31:35,054
Rym: You've watched this video.

473
00:31:35,094 --> 00:31:36,038
Rym: You cannot tune a piano.

474
00:31:36,078 --> 00:31:36,681
Rym: You're wrong.

475
00:31:36,741 --> 00:31:37,866
Scott: the sound sounds wrong.

476
00:31:37,926 --> 00:31:39,171
Rym: I'll bet you $100.

477
00:31:39,171 --> 00:31:41,884
Rym: This video is not wrong not better than anything.

478
00:31:41,904 --> 00:31:43,150
Scott: cuz what do I know about music?

479
00:31:44,672 --> 00:31:53,980
Scott: But I suspect many of you out there It's just common sense that you can make a string sound a particular frequency when it's hit with a hammer For and you can do that for one string.

480
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:00,210
Scott: you can do it for as many strings as you need even if you had three Pianos, so I suspect that the listenership view the listener.

481
00:32:00,391 --> 00:32:02,899
Rym: I guess our skits are obviously alities.

482
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:04,825
Scott: does that not make sense though.

483
00:32:05,186 --> 00:32:06,190
Rym: It does make sense.

484
00:32:07,494 --> 00:32:08,418
Rym: So that's the problem.

485
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:16,309
Rym: all the listener out there who are Musicians are go are laughing at you and all the people who are not musicians are laughing at me.

486
00:32:17,076 --> 00:32:18,550
Rym: And it is very counterintuitive.

487
00:32:19,031 --> 00:32:23,603
Rym: But this is why when you get a piano tune one string and can tune a thousand strings.

488
00:32:23,724 --> 00:32:29,510
Rym: an expert piano tuner if you care We'll ask you how you want the piano tempered.

489
00:32:30,454 --> 00:32:32,583
Rym: What temperament do you want to give the piano?

490
00:32:32,644 --> 00:32:33,970
Scott: I want every string to sound?

491
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:36,898
Scott: Exactly the frequency that it is supposed to.

492
00:32:37,299 --> 00:32:38,724
Rym: watch this video, and we'll.

493
00:32:38,744 --> 00:32:40,370
Rym: we'll talk about it again on Wednesday.

494
00:32:42,272 --> 00:32:51,277
Rym: In the moment we are going to be live at PAX West We're doing one panel.

495
00:32:51,297 --> 00:32:54,769
Rym: I forgot when it is so I got to pull up some Saturday our website.

496
00:32:54,789 --> 00:32:57,909
Rym: I think Saturday afternoon or evening or something like that.

497
00:32:59,651 --> 00:33:01,497
Rym: Five ish row crew calm.

498
00:33:01,818 --> 00:33:05,730
Rym: Saturday, September 3rd 5 p.m.. I remember chicken theater the grind.

499
00:33:06,454 --> 00:33:09,110
Scott: So you know at PAX East when you want to go to a theater?

500
00:33:10,091 --> 00:33:12,419
Scott: You just think oh, that's the albatross theater.

501
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:19,268
Scott: it must be at the top because it's a flying animal yep and it's a. so it must be in the corner because it goes ABCD.

502
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:28,879
Scott: if you are at PAX West and You hear the name of a theater such as the chicken theater How do you know where it is?

503
00:33:28,899 --> 00:33:31,370
Rym: isn't the first letter the name of the hotel?

504
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:32,614
Scott: It's in the first.

505
00:33:32,675 --> 00:33:33,297
Scott: that is correct.

506
00:33:33,337 --> 00:33:36,490
Scott: the first letter of the theater means we're in the Convention Center.

507
00:33:36,913 --> 00:33:39,430
Rym: That is correct as opposed to before we were in the hotel.

508
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,294
Rym: That's actually pretty.

509
00:33:40,314 --> 00:33:47,509
Scott: panels that are in the Hyatt begin with H And the ones that are in the Sheraton begin with s and such and such.

510
00:33:48,252 --> 00:33:48,813
Scott: That's how works.

511
00:33:49,034 --> 00:33:54,871
Rym: that is why packs is one of the best-run conventions on earth because they put the thought into making that sort of System.

512
00:33:55,393 --> 00:34:03,989
Rym: it does not hurt people who are too dumb to understand it or who are ignorant of it regardless of their intelligence But it helps people who have the gnosis also.

513
00:34:04,531 --> 00:34:08,225
Scott: We're a guess we're getting free badges to packs yet again meaning we have two badges.

514
00:34:08,284 --> 00:34:08,786
Scott: I have well.

515
00:34:08,806 --> 00:34:15,527
Scott: I have eight badges Friday Saturday Sunday Monday Friday Saturday Sunday Monday, and I got to do something with those.

516
00:34:15,888 --> 00:34:16,710
Scott: we'll figure that out.

517
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:20,186
Scott: I probably should get money in exchange to them because I could use some money.

518
00:34:20,206 --> 00:34:22,511
Rym: Yeah, well We'll sell them at least at face value We're not.

519
00:34:22,551 --> 00:34:26,409
Scott: well you could buy them from me with if you want to do something with them that is free.

520
00:34:27,053 --> 00:34:28,984
Scott: You could buy them from me with patreon money.

521
00:34:29,004 --> 00:34:32,074
Rym: Oh Oh, yeah Maybe we should.

522
00:34:32,094 --> 00:34:34,202
Rym: maybe I should buy them from you with patreon money and give them away.

523
00:34:34,282 --> 00:34:34,945
Scott: There's a markup.

524
00:34:35,607 --> 00:34:37,637
Rym: no markup No mark up.

525
00:34:37,858 --> 00:34:42,337
Scott: It's maybe like 50% mark up, dude We're some more 500% mark.

526
00:34:42,357 --> 00:34:46,489
Rym: we are among the blessed few who don't have to worry about getting tags badges.

527
00:34:46,571 --> 00:34:48,789
Rym: I'm not gonna scalp the badges we got.

528
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:50,958
Scott: I'm the one scalping them to you.

529
00:34:51,018 --> 00:34:51,944
Rym: Yes, you bought them.

530
00:34:52,165 --> 00:34:53,090
Rym: I I failed.

531
00:34:53,231 --> 00:34:57,910
Rym: I tried to buy packs badges because you know I'm always worried too, and I didn't get in in time.

532
00:34:58,352 --> 00:35:02,249
Rym: That's not my fault your bad internet, so I only have a badge because we're a guest again.

533
00:35:02,972 --> 00:35:04,700
Scott: Well, you would have had one of these ones if we.

534
00:35:04,961 --> 00:35:06,790
Rym: the book club book is Oryx and Craig.

535
00:35:06,991 --> 00:35:08,197
Scott: I finished it in like six hours.

536
00:35:08,237 --> 00:35:08,940
Scott: Rym didn't even read it.

537
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:23,176
Rym: yet the next Thursday episode that we do The one that comes next as in the one that comes before We will do our review of Oryx and Craig by Margaret Atwood Probably tomorrow.

538
00:35:23,256 --> 00:35:26,550
Rym: I'm gonna actually post because our website still says the book club is the eye of the world.

539
00:35:27,194 --> 00:35:28,321
Rym: I'm gonna officially update it.

540
00:35:28,442 --> 00:35:31,338
Scott: I also finished uh The great ordeal.

541
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,707
Rym: I'm about to finish it.

542
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:38,106
Scott: That's a Rym always talking about always trying to make fun of me like uh he's so much better at reading.

543
00:35:38,166 --> 00:35:45,027
Rym: you remembered more about Sorewheels fucking friend and the and his dad and Zoe him and all that than I did.

544
00:35:45,448 --> 00:35:52,370
Scott: I'm just saying You know I'm better at reading than Rym if I actually read you got a little bit ahead.

545
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:53,799
Scott: I'm just actually reads more.

546
00:35:54,382 --> 00:35:55,730
Rym: well cuz I didn't read at the beach.

547
00:35:55,791 --> 00:35:56,598
Rym: I said I'd read at the beach.

548
00:35:56,619 --> 00:35:57,386
Rym: you ready to the beach.

549
00:35:57,406 --> 00:35:57,628
Rym: I went.

550
00:35:57,648 --> 00:36:01,804
Rym: ah Yeah, I went I too But I didn't bike.

551
00:36:03,311 --> 00:36:09,390
Rym: Otherwise as you might have noticed GeekNights present through 10 episode 15 is up And I have a bonus by the weekend.

552
00:36:09,651 --> 00:36:17,922
Rym: I'm gonna put up a bonus episode episode 15 a much like we did episode I think to a where we were like what the hell is to chew.

553
00:36:18,484 --> 00:36:22,985
Rym: there's gonna be a special Varian version of episode 15 that talks about something different.

554
00:36:23,226 --> 00:36:23,467
Scott: Mm-hmm

555
00:36:24,271 --> 00:36:44,110
Rym: Basically, I'm gonna talk about the scene transitions in utenna with a bunch of specific examples And I'm gonna take all the scenes from episode 15 and show all the sort of Kubrick style Nonsense that you see in utenna where like in one scene someone's holding something and then in the next scene There's something sitting in the spot where the person was holding it and that's very much on purpose.

556
00:36:44,872 --> 00:36:45,963
Rym: Whatever, it's good stuff.

557
00:36:47,517 --> 00:36:51,795
Rym: other than that Watch the patreon You could buy our t-shirt.

558
00:36:52,277 --> 00:36:57,862
Rym: don't but hold out because hopefully soon I'll get a licensing deal and you'll be.

559
00:36:57,942 --> 00:37:03,742
Rym: you might be able to buy your very own Officially licensed chicken surprise and ice cream scream t-shirts.

560
00:37:03,982 --> 00:37:04,905
Scott: I'll buy ice cream scream.

561
00:37:05,126 --> 00:37:06,289
Rym: burger brothers is pretty good, too.

562
00:37:06,771 --> 00:37:09,162
Rym: Yeah, it's got two little guys with chef hats.

563
00:37:09,403 --> 00:37:10,629
Scott: I got to represent my full web.

564
00:37:11,252 --> 00:37:18,637
Rym: Actually ice cream sheep scream is good because you know that bright blue Threadless shirt with the lockdowns monster.

565
00:37:18,657 --> 00:37:19,560
Rym: Mm-hmm.

566
00:37:20,061 --> 00:37:25,260
Rym: So the ice cream scream shirt is that exact same color Because that's the color of ice cream scream.

567
00:37:25,622 --> 00:37:26,727
Rym: Anyway, stay tuned on all that.

568
00:37:27,048 --> 00:37:27,450
Rym: It'll be fun.

569
00:37:28,273 --> 00:37:30,923
Rym: So this issue comes up a lot in tech circles.

570
00:37:30,963 --> 00:37:36,990
Rym: like normal tech people know about this a lot But it's interesting to be aware of the fact that this is a much bigger problem.

571
00:37:37,414 --> 00:37:48,020
Rym: Like tech people say they care about this But the average tech person would not actually take advantage of the right to repair things that they fight for Even though ideologically know they're the right thing.

572
00:37:48,281 --> 00:37:49,024
Scott: It's principle.

573
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,210
Scott: Yeah principle the thing.

574
00:37:50,671 --> 00:37:52,838
Rym: So I'm gonna link to one because it's the most.

575
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:57,372
Rym: it's the most recent one of the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of articles You can find.

576
00:37:57,392 --> 00:38:02,490
Rym: that will show you the people who are actually really hurt by this problem.

577
00:38:02,631 --> 00:38:04,970
Rym: Mm-hmm and farmers are a really good example.

578
00:38:05,372 --> 00:38:08,770
Rym: So if you own a tractor, right you might think a tractor is a simple dumb thing.

579
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:12,987
Scott: But actually it's a motor and some wheels and maybe another motor to spin something.

580
00:38:13,067 --> 00:38:21,290
Rym: and you know Yep, but tractors have very complex gearing because of the kind of stuff they have to do and oftentimes Yeah, it's you know, it's a specifically powerful high torque engine, right?

581
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:31,430
Scott: It doesn't move real fast, but it can pull a lot of shit real, you know Heavy and but they also usually integrate with very complex mechanisms that they tow.

582
00:38:31,992 --> 00:38:35,309
Rym: The tractor itself you think of a tractor is like it's pulling something around.

583
00:38:35,349 --> 00:38:39,305
Rym: Yeah It's pulling around a giant death robot thresher or something, right?

584
00:38:39,365 --> 00:38:45,861
Scott: Not only is it pulling it It's also spinning things in that you know It's like sort of like my stand mixer right at the front.

585
00:38:45,901 --> 00:38:53,662
Scott: It has that attachment or it's like it's not just mixing It's also got this thing on the front that's turning that you can Attach an ice cream maker a meat grinder to and shit.

586
00:38:53,742 --> 00:38:55,790
Scott: now also tractors like that times a million.

587
00:38:56,071 --> 00:39:07,030
Rym: So unlike a consumer vehicle where there's lots and lots of customers and lots and lots of companies making them Which is what most people talk about when they talk about retro repair Not that many companies make for real tractors.

588
00:39:07,913 --> 00:39:09,369
Rym: That's a specialized thing.

589
00:39:09,611 --> 00:39:14,550
Scott: There's only a few companies in the world that make tractors like John Deere and maybe like caterpillar?

590
00:39:14,651 --> 00:39:16,089
Scott: Do they then they make other kinds of?

591
00:39:17,191 --> 00:39:19,170
Rym: Can't make similar, you know construction devices.

592
00:39:19,471 --> 00:39:27,389
Scott: You know specialized equipment like that is only made by a few companies and because you know Even if there are more companies is only a few that make good ones.

593
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:33,910
Rym: so like you say you wanted to buy a car and you Learned that from mechanics that that car was real expensive to maintain because mechanics couldn't fix it.

594
00:39:34,412 --> 00:39:36,823
Rym: You might decide to buy a car that didn't have that problem.

595
00:39:37,144 --> 00:39:38,410
Rym: Let's buy this Volkswagen.

596
00:39:38,672 --> 00:39:40,770
Scott: Why is there a huge line to the service department behind?

597
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:42,816
Scott: Let's not buy one of these.

598
00:39:42,836 --> 00:39:45,950
Rym: Yeah, let's buy this kinda and I'll just mess with it myself.

599
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:54,033
Rym: But if you buy a John Deere tractor like this article is very detailed if you buy the John Deere 8235 are Mm-hmm.

600
00:39:54,234 --> 00:39:57,610
Rym: You can't fucking fix anything on it if something goes wrong.

601
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:02,139
Scott: I mean, it's a motor though shouldn't you just open it up look at the motor and if you know how motor works be able to fix it?

602
00:40:03,232 --> 00:40:04,096
Rym: What do you like what this could?

603
00:40:04,116 --> 00:40:10,745
Rym: so this this article is about a farmer who's fighting for the right to repair his own tractor So it has codes that'll pop up telling you.

604
00:40:10,765 --> 00:40:11,488
Rym: Hey, there's a problem.

605
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:16,970
Rym: Legally you're not even allowed to look up what that code means because that would violate the DMCA.

606
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:25,081
Rym: The codes themselves are covered by the DMCA and under copyright You're not allowed to do things like like that.

607
00:40:25,121 --> 00:40:27,028
Rym: the code might mean change a filter.

608
00:40:27,509 --> 00:40:35,209
Rym: now You're probably not even allowed to change the filter Even if you know what the code means because if you do you might void the service contract with John Deere.

609
00:40:35,611 --> 00:40:39,949
Scott: What if you buy one without a service contract, uh, then you probably can't repair it.

610
00:40:41,474 --> 00:40:41,656
Rym: Like.

611
00:40:41,696 --> 00:40:42,910
Rym: the tractors are expensive.

612
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:48,170
Rym: They have very complicated sensors and they're basically there's a computer in there like all cars have computers in them.

613
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:57,146
Rym: now tractors have way more complicated computers and There aren't nearly as many people who are hacking those computers like there are with the car mod community.

614
00:40:57,648 --> 00:40:59,373
Scott: and even then yeah It's not like computer.

615
00:40:59,393 --> 00:41:05,172
Rym: people are buying tractors and say you're a farmer and you buy a super expensive tractor upon which your livelihood Depends.

616
00:41:05,574 --> 00:41:14,129
Rym: you're not gonna start hacking it because if you break it not only might you get sued by John Deere But they might just say well, we're not selling any more tractors and then what buy one for someone else?

617
00:41:14,892 --> 00:41:15,113
Rym: Who?

618
00:41:15,153 --> 00:41:20,234
Rym: there's only so many people who make tractors and they all seem to have this problem and you already lost all your money buying That first one.

619
00:41:20,636 --> 00:41:24,757
Rym: So John Deere very publicly is Against the right to repair.

620
00:41:24,777 --> 00:41:27,269
Scott: Yeah, they want you to pay them every time something breaks.

621
00:41:28,211 --> 00:41:45,469
Rym: John Deere apparently officially said on record in an interview with Wired that giving giving farmers access to the software would quote Make it possible for pirates third-party developers and less innovative competitors to free ride off the creativity unique expression and ingenuity of vehicle software.

622
00:41:47,012 --> 00:41:48,336
Rym: And they're using the DMCA.

623
00:41:48,356 --> 00:41:52,932
Rym: as far as I can tell that's the primary tool they're using to f over the farmers Mm-hmm.

624
00:41:53,795 --> 00:42:10,190
Rym: So this is an issue that I don't know how we're gonna win anything because as you pointed out and I'd forgotten about there was a right to repair bill in New York and The tech companies particularly Apple made sure it didn't pass Mm-hmm, so we have no right to repair our devices, right?

625
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:12,860
Scott: Cuz the same thing applies right it would it would you know, make it.

626
00:42:13,241 --> 00:42:15,610
Scott: anyone could just open up an old Apple repair business.

627
00:42:15,952 --> 00:42:19,295
Rym: Yeah, which I feel like that should be the case I got there is there are.

628
00:42:19,315 --> 00:42:22,890
Scott: they exist but they would be even better if you know, there weren't these legal restrictions.

629
00:42:22,971 --> 00:42:29,030
Rym: So I guess is there any argument we can make against Repealing this part of the DMCA and letting people repair their own devices?

630
00:42:29,431 --> 00:42:32,341
Scott: You mean an argument like in John Deere's favor?

631
00:42:32,361 --> 00:42:32,823
Rym: Yeah, like.

632
00:42:32,863 --> 00:42:34,549
Rym: is there any argument in Apple's favor?

633
00:42:34,609 --> 00:42:35,452
Rym: or yeah There's favor.

634
00:42:35,493 --> 00:42:37,381
Scott: those companies make more money this way.

635
00:42:37,401 --> 00:42:39,610
Rym: Are is there any non evil argument?

636
00:42:40,211 --> 00:42:45,529
Scott: No, if you buy something isn't the old saying, you know, if you can't fix it, you don't own it, right?

637
00:42:45,609 --> 00:42:52,089
Scott: So It's people wanting are using the DMCA to basically collect rents.

638
00:42:53,574 --> 00:42:54,629
Scott: That's all there is to it.

639
00:42:54,991 --> 00:43:11,630
Rym: Now that that the if you don't if you can't repair you don't own it is a little bit troublesome though in the sense that We're entering a world where there's so much technology that it's basically expected that 99% of all humans will not be able to repair 99% of the things that they own even if there is zero legal restriction.

640
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:15,630
Scott: I mean even if you go back to the 80s or when I bought a stereo it came with a complete schematic.

641
00:43:16,273 --> 00:43:18,424
Rym: Yeah, did you ever solder your stereo to fix it?

642
00:43:18,464 --> 00:43:19,550
Scott: I never even opened it, right?

643
00:43:20,212 --> 00:43:25,595
Rym: When my cereal broke I did not use the schematic to fix it when we had a compressor for GeekNights and one day it Stopped working.

644
00:43:25,616 --> 00:43:32,465
Rym: I had the full schematic I had the full documentation of how it worked and everything and I did not try to repair it.

645
00:43:32,826 --> 00:43:34,210
Rym: I threw it away, right?

646
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:35,990
Scott: So that's the step number one.

647
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:42,230
Scott: If you can't repair it You don't own it is even if you're allowed to repair it and you have the information as needed to repair it.

648
00:43:42,771 --> 00:43:54,130
Scott: you need to have these skills and knowledge to actually execute that repair and you know, the Willingness to try to do the repair with a risk of failure, right?

649
00:43:54,650 --> 00:44:02,143
Scott: So, you know if you don't have those things if you don't know how to you know work with an engine You could get a car and like a full blueprint to the car.

650
00:44:02,163 --> 00:44:06,601
Scott: and if you don't know how to do anything You don't have to use a wrench or understand how an engine works.

651
00:44:07,204 --> 00:44:08,750
Scott: You don't really own that car.

652
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:12,366
Scott: You really you know the mechanic who lives near you has you.

653
00:44:12,446 --> 00:44:13,149
Scott: oh, they own you.

654
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:18,350
Scott: They own that car really and you have to pay them for the ability to use your car if it ever breaks.

655
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:22,422
Rym: But at least in that got you over a barrel you can go to any mechanic.

656
00:44:22,944 --> 00:44:24,770
Scott: Yes, you can go to any mechanic.

657
00:44:25,111 --> 00:44:27,197
Rym: There's a wider net so more there's.

658
00:44:27,378 --> 00:44:31,130
Scott: it is better, but you're still being owned and you're not the owner.

659
00:44:31,431 --> 00:44:36,333
Rym: Yeah, but that distinction is increasing in principle, but in practicality It's increasingly meaningless.

660
00:44:36,574 --> 00:44:39,943
Rym: because the reality is you can't even expect people to have that capability.

661
00:44:40,324 --> 00:44:41,588
Rym: and also there's a side argument.

662
00:44:41,608 --> 00:44:46,507
Scott: What if You even own yourself if you don't know how to doctor yourself, right?

663
00:44:46,889 --> 00:44:50,546
Rym: Yeah On your own body, I'm gonna defer to other people.

664
00:44:50,566 --> 00:44:50,968
Rym: I'm not dr.

665
00:44:51,048 --> 00:44:52,254
Rym: McNinja I'm not gonna so much.

666
00:44:52,455 --> 00:44:54,484
Rym: I'm not gonna undislocate my own jaw.

667
00:44:54,504 --> 00:44:55,890
Rym: I'm not gonna relocate my job.

668
00:44:58,474 --> 00:44:59,050
Scott: Doctor own it.

669
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:00,953
Rym: Doctor owns my jaw.

670
00:45:00,993 --> 00:45:03,199
Rym: Yeah doctor owns most things about my body.

671
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:06,106
Rym: I mostly own my allergies my nose stuff.

672
00:45:06,126 --> 00:45:06,788
Rym: I know about that.

673
00:45:06,808 --> 00:45:09,193
Rym: Mm-hmm But what?

674
00:45:09,213 --> 00:45:13,130
Rym: so let's say we didn't have any of these laws and you were free to fix anything.

675
00:45:14,112 --> 00:45:25,584
Rym: At what point is a company like Apple like within their moral rights to say because you tried to fix this But you're stupid We're not going to value when we're gonna avoid the warranty.

676
00:45:25,624 --> 00:45:26,106
Scott: That's fine.

677
00:45:26,428 --> 00:45:31,047
Rym: That's fine Yeah, so what if Apple said if you ever try to repair it, we're gonna void your warranty.

678
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:31,690
Scott: That's fine.

679
00:45:32,412 --> 00:45:39,514
Rym: So that means that even if there was no DMCA you would still not actually have the practical Read space writer.

680
00:45:39,554 --> 00:45:42,783
Scott: Well, no because if something is currently under warranty, right?

681
00:45:43,064 --> 00:45:45,571
Scott: So Apple sells you iPhone a month later It breaks.

682
00:45:46,233 --> 00:45:53,234
Scott: you could repair it yourself because with this we're assuming we have the right to repair and we have the schematics We know how to fix it.

683
00:45:53,676 --> 00:45:56,628
Scott: We got you know, Apple's providing service manuals and shit, right?

684
00:45:57,472 --> 00:46:04,366
Scott: But if it's under warranty There's no reason for you to do that because you're gonna get a free fucking repair or replacement.

685
00:46:04,727 --> 00:46:08,863
Rym: All right, wait, so is Apple Obligated in this case to provide the service manuals.

686
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:12,970
Scott: I Mean if you have the right to repair and in though.

687
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:16,530
Rym: Well, no, do you have the positive right to repair or the negative right to repair?

688
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:18,990
Rym: Do you have the right to repair if you don't have the service manual?

689
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:24,730
Scott: You don't have there even if you have the right to fix it, but no, there's a you don't really have the ability.

690
00:46:24,871 --> 00:46:27,769
Scott: See, it doesn't it's meaningless, but there is a huge no different.

691
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:37,457
Rym: There is a huge difference between saying you're not allowed to repair it and saying any company that makes something is forced to make Manual a service manual.

692
00:46:37,517 --> 00:46:44,030
Scott: It's different but in in terms of like yes, that's going a bit further But really if you don't make the people give you the service manual.

693
00:46:44,833 --> 00:46:48,890
Scott: It doesn't matter if you give people the right to repair they can't repair it because they don't have the fucking service manual.

694
00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:55,410
Rym: So but it does create a market for third-party people who will reverse engineer the service manual which we've seen happen with consumer vehicles.

695
00:46:55,551 --> 00:47:00,850
Scott: They can't but they can't get it exactly right and you're always gonna be left like is that repair place?

696
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:04,430
Scott: Like got it 100% right because they only have a reverse engineered idea.

697
00:47:04,831 --> 00:47:10,010
Scott: They don't know exactly right and that original place who made the thing still has that.

698
00:47:10,592 --> 00:47:11,254
Rym: What's the line?

699
00:47:11,294 --> 00:47:12,338
Rym: So say I make a video game?

700
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:13,763
Rym: What's the service manual?

701
00:47:13,803 --> 00:47:19,902
Scott: I'm now obligated to provide to my customers I mean a video game isn't really something that gets repaired what there's a bug.

702
00:47:20,384 --> 00:47:22,150
Rym: keep tribes who doesn't work on my video card.

703
00:47:25,111 --> 00:47:30,695
Rym: Do they have to give me the source code which is the service manual if it has comments in it and then I can repair It myself.

704
00:47:31,038 --> 00:47:31,744
Rym: What's the line?

705
00:47:31,785 --> 00:47:32,350
Rym: That's what I'm saying?

706
00:47:32,551 --> 00:47:40,883
Rym: That's why I'm shying far from a positive right to repair because that opens a can of worms that I don't think Humanity is capable of sorting yet.

707
00:47:40,903 --> 00:47:42,534
Scott: Oh I could.

708
00:47:42,654 --> 00:47:43,559
Scott: I'm fine with that.

709
00:47:43,579 --> 00:47:48,285
Rym: Well, I would I guess if we're gonna go with positive rights I'd rather go with like some positive rights.

710
00:47:48,467 --> 00:47:53,664
Scott: I think you can Think you get into a situation where it's like, okay, you made a video game, right?

711
00:47:54,045 --> 00:47:54,928
Scott: You're delivering it.

712
00:47:55,008 --> 00:47:55,570
Scott: There's a bug.

713
00:47:56,294 --> 00:47:57,420
Scott: Are you gonna patch that bug?

714
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,050
Scott: Yeah, you got some kind of warranty, right?

715
00:47:59,191 --> 00:48:00,938
Scott: You know, are you gonna give the person a refund?

716
00:48:00,959 --> 00:48:01,601
Scott: or what are you gonna do?

717
00:48:02,305 --> 00:48:03,430
Scott: and if they don't patch it?

718
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:05,389
Scott: That means they're not maintaining it anymore.

719
00:48:06,291 --> 00:48:14,665
Scott: You could go to if you could go to court and force them to give you the source code Because you have the right to repair and they're refusing to repair it and give you a because

720
00:48:14,685 --> 00:48:24,706
Rym: that would edge a little bit Into the orphan work stuff with copyright where if no one's using this thing or no one can identify who owns it Maybe there should be a way for someone to reclaim it the same way you can reclaim.

721
00:48:24,766 --> 00:48:27,474
Scott: It's all the same issue Yeah, but we're just incapable.

722
00:48:27,515 --> 00:48:29,459
Rym: society is dealing with that issue whatever.

723
00:48:30,101 --> 00:48:46,122
Rym: but I guess if we're gonna if we're gonna focus on practical Realities the practical reality of consumer vehicles is that even though it's technically illegal in a lot of places to reverse engineer this People are doing it and it's almost working itself out.

724
00:48:46,323 --> 00:48:53,840
Scott: I mean, I just saw a YouTube video of There's those people who found the Super PlayStation in their attic or whatever.

725
00:48:54,121 --> 00:49:07,643
Scott: Oh, yeah, and they brought it to Ben Hector whatever his name is that guy and He totally like got the CD-ROM working again and shit just by figuring it out because he knows so much about Electronics and he had a super didn't edit SNES schematic and the things.

726
00:49:07,724 --> 00:49:09,430
Scott: mostly is Super Nintendo with the CD-ROM.

727
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:14,130
Scott: Yeah, and he was able to you know, like replace some bad capacitors and you know get stuff going.

728
00:49:14,271 --> 00:49:18,370
Scott: So it's like you can get really far even without any manuals whatsoever.

729
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:20,318
Rym: So, I guess actually.

730
00:49:20,338 --> 00:49:23,090
Rym: so the one final piece what if you make a dip like Apple?

731
00:49:23,334 --> 00:49:30,937
Rym: This is where I would defend them If you make a device like people used to complain about how you can't swap the batteries out of certain devices Because they're built-in embedded.

732
00:49:31,399 --> 00:49:38,422
Rym: There are situations where making something less Modular or less repairable could make its form factor better.

733
00:49:38,463 --> 00:49:39,927
Rym: Like look at most good laptops.

734
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:45,910
Rym: I Defy you to do significant repairs on them because they're so embedded and tightly coupled.

735
00:49:46,292 --> 00:49:48,582
Rym: The tight coupling is what made it a good thing.

736
00:49:48,602 --> 00:50:02,429
Scott: I'm not saying you have to make your device Physically easy to repair at that to sacrifice the quality of the device I'm just saying yep You have to provide the in you should you know in an ideal world have to provide the full schematic of this device.

737
00:50:03,191 --> 00:50:11,527
Scott: It's that someone with the not appropriate knowledge and tools could repair it without having to pay the original manufacturer After the warranty is done.

738
00:50:12,414 --> 00:50:31,322
Rym: Thus I propose if nothing else Instead of like cell phones and cars and the things that the right-to-repair Activists usually fight about because those things are pretty abstract to the average person and the issues get pretty complex we should probably focus on the Specific harms to society that matter like farms and tractors.

739
00:50:31,423 --> 00:50:43,760
Rym: I feel like narrow legislation in specific industries like this with captive audiences with rights to repair in those circumstances would break the seal and Normal non techies can understand.

740
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:44,643
Rym: Well, what do you mean?

741
00:50:44,664 --> 00:50:46,130
Rym: the farmer can't fix his fucking tractor?

742
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:47,054
Rym: What's that bullshit?

743
00:50:47,376 --> 00:50:49,970
Rym: because that same person cares a lot less about your smartphone?

744
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:51,897
Scott: Mm-hmm.

745
00:50:51,918 --> 00:50:53,227
Scott: I think people understand that.

746
00:50:53,308 --> 00:51:05,090
Scott: you know They're upset when their phone breaks and they're upset when they go to the Apple Store and Apple won't help them and then they go To a place that charges a fortune Whereas if this law had passed you could have gone to a place and gotten charged way less than a fortune.

747
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:13,432
Rym: Yep, when the Apple geniuses didn't want to help you I also do think that law should have passed because skimming what it actually did it was babies first Like.

748
00:51:13,492 --> 00:51:14,697
Rym: it didn't do a lot.

749
00:51:14,837 --> 00:51:16,383
Scott: No, it didn't go nearly far enough.

750
00:51:16,584 --> 00:51:18,090
Scott: Yeah, and it didn't pass either.

751
00:51:18,733 --> 00:51:19,578
Rym: So it's just something to think about.

752
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:21,910
Scott: it was New York only it wasn't even like the whole country.

753
00:51:22,392 --> 00:51:27,470
Rym: But when you've got when you're a techie who's got a very like I have a lot of real angry opinions about copyright.

754
00:51:28,652 --> 00:51:30,846
Rym: The average person doesn't understand those things.

755
00:51:30,866 --> 00:51:42,650
Rym: You've got to pick specific concrete Understandable examples and advocate for specific Focused practical solutions to those and when enough of those accrete you can then make the general case.

756
00:51:43,072 --> 00:51:47,470
Rym: I think that works a lot better than vaguely agitating for complex things that people don't understand.

757
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:50,238
Scott: I mean, I only care about repairing shit.

758
00:51:50,258 --> 00:51:53,210
Scott: I don't care about the optimal way to make a law pass.

759
00:51:53,813 --> 00:51:55,159
Rym: Yeah, but that's so.

760
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:56,405
Rym: that's so you voted for Bernie.

761
00:51:56,425 --> 00:51:57,269
Rym: I guess I voted for Hillary.

762
00:51:58,752 --> 00:51:59,696
Scott: Yet, it's not November.

763
00:51:59,716 --> 00:52:00,659
Rym: would you vote for in the primary?

764
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:01,242
Scott: I didn't.

765
00:52:01,503 --> 00:52:02,667
Rym: you really didn't vote in the primary.

766
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,290
Scott: not allowed to.

767
00:52:03,892 --> 00:52:04,674
Rym: You're not a Democrat.

768
00:52:04,875 --> 00:52:05,076
Rym: Nope.

769
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:09,369
Scott: Oh, I'm a nothing and you can't change because you know change.

770
00:52:09,389 --> 00:52:15,510
Rym: I Changed way back because I was real pissed that I couldn't vote for Zephyr teach-out because primaries in New York.

771
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:17,416
Rym: It's literally the only thing that matters in New York.

772
00:52:17,777 --> 00:52:21,108
Rym: So I changed back then to be able to start voting now.

773
00:52:21,489 --> 00:52:23,518
Rym: Hmm That's a separate issue.

774
00:52:23,719 --> 00:52:24,586
